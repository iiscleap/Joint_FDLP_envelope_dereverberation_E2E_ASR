8312-279790-0046 WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I SAW HIS POOR FEATHERS SCATTERED ON THE GROUND AND KNEW THAT HE WAS NO MORE SO SHE GRIEVED ALL DAY LONG THE BEAUTIFUL BLUE BIRD HID IN A HOLLOW TREE SPENT THE HOURS IN THINKING OF HIS PRINCESS
8312-279790-0047 AND SOUGHT FOR SOME DIAMOND EAR RINGS WHICH HE BROUGHT BACK IN HIS BEAK AND WHEN NIGHT CAME OFFERED THEM TO FLORINA SO NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HE BROUGHT HER SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL AND THEY TALKED TOGETHER TILL DAY
8312-279790-0048 WHERE HE SANG HER PRAISES IN A VOICE SO SWEET THAT THE PASSERS BY THOUGHT IT WAS NOT A BIRD BUT A SPIRIT RUMOURS WENT ABOUT THAT THE PLACE WAS HAUNTED AND NO ONE WOULD GO NEAR THE SPOT
8312-279790-0049 AND THOUGH SHE SAW NOBODY AND HE LIVED IN THE HOLLOW OF A TREE THEY ALWAYS FOUND PLENTY TO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER THE MALICIOUS QUEEN TRIED WITH ALL HER MIGHT TO GET TROUTINA MARRIED BUT IN VAIN NOBODY WOULD HAVE HER
8312-279790-0050 IF IT WERE FLORINA NOW SAID THE KINGS OR THE KINGS AMBASSADORS WE SHOULD BE MOST HAPPY TO SIGN THE CONTRACT THAT GIRL THWARTS US STILL SAID THE QUEEN
8312-279790-0051 WHO LIKED TO SEE HER LOVELY AND SHE HAD ADORNED HERSELF WITH ALL THE PRETTY THINGS HE HAD GIVEN HER HE PERCHED ON THE WINDOW SILL AND SHE SAT AT THE WINDOW AND THEY WERE SINGING TOGETHER A DUET WHICH THE QUEEN HEARD OUTSIDE
8312-279791-0000 BUT HE WOULD NOT HE HAD SEEN THE QUEEN AND TROUTINA AND THOUGH HE COULD NOT DEFEND HIS PRINCESS HE REFUSED TO LEAVE HER THE TWO RUSHED UPON HER LIKE FURIES HER WONDERFUL BEAUTY AND HER SPLENDID JEWELS STARTLED THEM
8312-279791-0001 AM I LIKELY TO DO THIS I A POOR PRINCESS KEPT IN CAPTIVITY FOR TWO YEARS WITH YOU AS MY GAOLER IN CAPTIVITY REPEATED THE QUEEN WHY THEN DO YOU DRESS YOURSELF SO FINE
8312-279791-0002 AND ADORN YOUR CHAMBER WITH FLOWERS I HAVE LEISURE ENOUGH I MAY JUST AS WELL SPEND SOME OF IT IN ADORNING MYSELF INSTEAD OF BEMOANING MY MISFORTUNE INNOCENT AS I AM INNOCENT INDEED CRIED THE QUEEN
8312-279791-0003 AND BEGAN TO SEARCH THE ROOM IN IT SHE FOUND ALL KING CHARMING'S PRESENTS DIAMONDS RUBIES EMERALDS AMETHYSTS IN SHORT JEWELS WITHOUT END MEANTIME FROM THE WINDOW THE BLUE BIRD
8312-279791-0004 WHO HAD THE EYE OF A LYNX SANG ALOUD BEWARE FLORINA YOU SEE MADAM SAID FLORINA EVEN THE SPIRITS OF THE AIR TAKE PITY UPON ME I SEE THAT YOU ARE IN LEAGUE WITH DEMONS BUT YOUR FATHER SHALL JUDGE YOU
8312-279791-0005 AND VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED THE QUEEN LEFT HER AND WENT TO HOLD COUNSEL WITH TROUTINA AS TO WHAT WAS TO BE DONE THEY AGREED TO PUT IN FLORINA'S CHAMBER A WAITING MAID WHO SHOULD WATCH HER FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT
8312-279791-0006 WHEN THE PRINCESS LEARNT THIS SHE WAS IN GREAT GRIEF ALAS CRIED SHE I CAN NO LONGER TALK WITH MY BIRD WHO LOVED ME SO
8312-279791-0007 BUT THE SERVING MAID WATCHED HER NIGHT AND DAY AT LAST OVERCOME WITH WEARINESS THE GIRL FELL ASLEEP AND THEN FLORINA OPENED HER LITTLE WINDOW AND SANG IN A LOW VOICE BLUE BIRD BLUE BIRD COME TO MY SIDE
8312-279791-0008 THE BLUE BIRD FLEW TO THE WINDOW SILL AND THEY LAVISHED ON ONE ANOTHER A HUNDRED CARESSES AND TALKED TOGETHER TILL DAWN NEXT NIGHT IT HAPPENED THE SAME TILL THEY BEGAN TO HOPE THAT THE WAITING MAID
8312-279791-0009 WHO WARBLED IN HER EAR AND TOUCHED HER GENTLY WITH HIS BEAK THE SPY LISTENED AND HEARD ALL THEIR CONVERSATION VERY MUCH ASTONISHED THAT A PRINCESS COULD BE SO FOND OF A MERE BIRD WHEN DAY CAME
8312-279791-0010 SHE RELATED ALL TO THE QUEEN AND TROUTINA WHO CONCLUDED THAT THE BIRD COULD BE NO OTHER THAN KING CHARMING THEY SENT THE GIRL BACK TOLD HER TO EXPRESS NO CURIOSITY BUT TO FEIGN SLEEP
8312-279791-0011 AND TO GO TO BED EARLIER THAN USUAL THEN THE POOR DECEIVED PRINCESS OPENED HER LITTLE WINDOW AND SANG HER USUAL SONG BLUE BIRD BLUE BIRD COME TO MY SIDE
8312-279791-0012 BUT NO BLUE BIRD APPEARED THE QUEEN HAD CAUSED SHARP KNIVES TO BE HUNG OUTSIDE THE HOLLOW OF THE TREE HE FLEW AGAINST THEM AND CUT HIS FEET AND WINGS TILL HE DROPPED DOWN COVERED WITH BLOOD
8312-279791-0013 OH FLORINA COME TO MY HELP SIGHED HE BUT SHE IS DEAD I KNOW AND I WILL DIE ALSO AT THAT MOMENT HIS FRIEND THE MAGICIAN
8312-279791-0014 HAD GONE EIGHT TIMES ROUND THE WORLD IN SEARCH OF HIM MADE HIS NINTH JOURNEY AND CAME TO THE TREE WHERE THE POOR BLUE BIRD LAY CALLING OUT KING CHARMING KING CHARMING THE KING RECOGNISED THE VOICE OF HIS BEST FRIEND
8312-279791-0015 WHY CAN I NOT RETURN AND GOVERN IT AS BEFORE I FEAR REPLIED HIS FRIEND THAT THE THING IS DIFFICULT WHO WOULD OBEY A BLUE BIRD AH THAT IS TOO TRUE CRIED THE KING SADLY
8312-279791-0016 PEOPLE ONLY JUDGE BY THE OUTSIDE MEANTIME FLORINA OVERCOME WITH GRIEF FELL DANGEROUSLY SICK AND IN HER SICKNESS SHE KEPT SINGING DAY AND NIGHT HER LITTLE SONG BLUE BIRD BLUE BIRD
8312-279791-0017 COME TO MY SIDE BUT NO ONE REGARDED HER AT LAST A SUDDEN CHANGE TOOK PLACE IN HER FORTUNES THE KING HER FATHER DIED AND THE PEOPLE WHO KNEW SHE WAS HIS HEIR BEGAN TO INQUIRE WITH ONE ACCORD
8312-279791-0018 WHERE WAS THE PRINCESS FLORINA THEY ASSAILED THE PALACE IN CROWDS DEMANDING HER FOR THEIR SOVEREIGN THE RIOT BECAME SO DANGEROUS THAT TROUTINA AND HER MOTHER FLED AWAY TO THE FAIRY SOUSSIO
8312-279791-0019 RESTORED FLORINA'S HEALTH AND GAVE HER STRENGTH TO CALL A COUNCIL AND ARRANGE ALL THE AFFAIRS OF HER KINGDOM THEN SHE DEPARTED BY NIGHT AND ALONE TO GO OVER THE WORLD IN SEARCH OF HER BLUE BIRD THE MAGICIAN
8312-279791-0020 WHO WAS KING CHARMING'S FRIEND WENT TO THE FAIRY SOUSSIO WHOM HE KNEW FOR THEY HAD QUARRELLED AND MADE IT UP AGAIN AS FAIRIES AND MAGICIANS DO MANY TIMES WITHIN THE LAST FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED YEARS
8312-279791-0021 SHE RECEIVED HIM CIVILLY AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE WANTED HE TRIED TO MAKE A BARGAIN WITH HER BUT COULD EFFECT NOTHING UNLESS KING CHARMING WOULD CONSENT TO MARRY TROUTINA THE ENCHANTER FOUND THIS BRIDE SO UGLY
8312-279791-0022 THAT HE COULD NOT ADVISE STILL THE BLUE BIRD HAD RUN SO MANY RISKS IN HIS CAGE THE NAIL IT WAS HUNG UPON HAD BROKEN AND THE KING SUFFERED MUCH IN THE FALL MINETTA THE CAT HAD GLOWERED AT HIM WITH HER GREEN EYES
8312-279791-0023 HE HAD BEEN A LINNET OR A JAY WORSE THAN ALL HIS NEXT HEIR SPREAD REPORTS OF HIS DEATH
8312-279791-0024 UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE MAGICIAN THOUGHT IT BEST TO AGREE WITH SOUSSIO THAT KING CHARMING SHOULD BE RESTORED TO HIS KINGDOM AND HIS NATURAL SHAPE FOR SIX MONTHS ON CONDITION THAT TROUTINA SHOULD REMAIN IN HIS PALACE
8312-279791-0025 BUT HE THOUGHT LESS OF THESE THINGS THAN HOW TO ESCAPE FROM THE HORROR OF MARRYING TROUTINA MEANWHILE THE QUEEN FLORINA IN A PEASANT'S DRESS WITH A STRAW HAT ON HER HEAD AND A CANVAS SACK ON HER SHOULDER
8312-279791-0026 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ALL ALONE GOOD MOTHER REPLIED THE QUEEN I HAVE TOO MANY TROUBLES TO BE PLEASANT COMPANY FOR ANYBODY TELL ME YOUR TROUBLES AND I MAY BE ABLE TO SOFTEN THEM
8312-279791-0027 DO NOT AFFLICT YOURSELF HAPPINESS WILL YET BE YOURS TAKE THESE FOUR EGGS AND WHENEVER YOU ARE IN TROUBLE BREAK THEM AND SEE WHAT ENSUES SO SAYING THE FAIRY VANISHED FLORINA
8312-279791-0028 GREATLY COMFORTED PUT THE EGGS IN HER SACK
8312-279791-0029 SHE WALKED EIGHT DAYS AND NIGHTS WITHOUT STOPPING AND THEN CAME TO A MOUNTAIN MADE ENTIRELY OF IVORY AND NEARLY PERPENDICULAR DESPAIRING OF EVER CLIMBING IT
8312-279791-0030 SHE SANK DOWN AT THE FOOT PREPARED TO DIE THERE WHEN SHE BETHOUGHT HERSELF OF THE EGGS LET ME SEE SAID SHE IF THE FAIRY HAS DECEIVED ME OR NOT SO SHE BROKE ONE AND INSIDE IT WERE LITTLE HOOKS OF GOLD
8312-279791-0031 WHICH SHE FITTED ON HER FEET AND HANDS AND BY MEANS OF WHICH SHE CLIMBED THE MOUNTAIN WITH EASE ARRIVED AT THE SUMMIT SHE FOUND NEW DIFFICULTIES FOR THE VALLEY BELOW WAS ONE LARGE SMOOTH MIRROR
8312-279791-0032 IN WHICH SIXTY THOUSAND WOMEN STOOD ADMIRING THEMSELVES THEY HAD NEED FOR THE CHARM OF THE MIRROR WAS THAT EACH SAW HERSELF THEREIN NOT AS SHE WAS BUT AS SHE WISHED TO BE
8312-279791-0033 AND THE GRIMACES THEY MADE WERE ENOUGH TO CAUSE A PERSON TO DIE OF LAUGHTER NOT ONE OF THEM HAD EVER GAINED THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN AND WHEN THEY SAW FLORINA THERE THEY ALL BURST INTO ANGRY OUTCRIES
8312-279791-0034 WILL YOU CONVEY ME TO THE PALACE OF KING CHARMING THE OBEDIENT PIGEONS DID SO FLYING DAY AND NIGHT TILL THEY REACHED THE CITY GATES WHEN THE QUEEN DISMISSED THEM WITH A SWEET KISS WHICH WAS WORTH MORE THAN HER CROWN
8312-279791-0035 BESIDES HE IS GOING TO MORROW TO THE TEMPLE WITH THE PRINCESS TROUTINA WHOM HE HAS AT LAST AGREED TO MARRY FLORINA SAT DOWN ON A DOOR STEP AND HID HER FACE UNDER HER STRAW HAT AND HER DROOPING HAIR
8312-279791-0036 ALAS SHE CRIED MY BLUE BIRD HAS FORSAKEN ME SHE NEITHER ATE NOR SLEPT BUT ROSE WITH THE DAWN AND PUSHED HER WAY THROUGH THE GUARDS TO THE TEMPLE WHERE SHE SAW TWO THRONES ONE FOR KING CHARMING
8312-279791-0037 AND THE OTHER FOR TROUTINA THEY ARRIVED SHORTLY HE MORE CHARMING AND SHE MORE REPULSIVE THAN EVER KNITTING HER BROWS TROUTINA EXCLAIMED WHAT CREATURE IS THAT WHO DARES APPROACH SO NEAR MY GOLDEN THRONE
8312-279791-0038 THESE ARE PRETTY TRINKETS SAID TROUTINA AND GOING UP TO THE KING SHE ASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THEM AT SIGHT OF THE ORNAMENTS HE TURNED PALE REMEMBERING THOSE HE HAD GIVEN TO FLORINA
8312-279791-0039 THESE BRACELETS ARE WORTH HALF MY KINGDOM I DID NOT THINK THERE HAD BEEN MORE THAN ONE PAIR IN THE WORLD THEN I WILL BUY THESE SAID TROUTINA BUT FLORINA REFUSED TO SELL THEM FOR MONEY
8312-279791-0040 THE PRICE SHE ASKED WAS PERMISSION TO SLEEP A NIGHT IN THE CHAMBER OF ECHOES AS YOU WILL YOUR BARGAINS ARE CHEAP ENOUGH REPLIED TROUTINA LAUGHING AND WHEN SHE LAUGHED SHE SHOWED TEETH LIKE THE TUSKS OF A WILD BOAR
8312-279791-0041 NOW THE KING WHEN HE WAS A BLUE BIRD HAD INFORMED FLORINA ABOUT THIS CHAMBER OF ECHOES WHERE EVERY WORD SPOKEN COULD BE HEARD IN HIS OWN CHAMBER
8312-279791-0042 BUT SHE HAD NO MORE JEWELS TO TEMPT TROUTINA SO SHE BROKE THE THIRD EGG OUT OF IT CAME A CHARIOT OF POLISHED STEEL INLAID WITH GOLD DRAWN BY SIX GREEN MICE THE COACHMAN BEING A ROSE COLOURED RAT
8312-279791-0043 AND THE POSTILION A GREY ONE INSIDE THE CARRIAGE SAT LITTLE PUPPETS WHO BEHAVED THEMSELVES JUST LIKE LIVE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WHEN TROUTINA WENT TO WALK IN THE PALACE GARDEN FLORINA AWAITED HER IN A GREEN ALLEY
8312-279791-0044 AND MADE THE MICE GALLOP AND THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN BOW TILL THE PRINCESS WAS DELIGHTED AND READY TO BUY THE CURIOSITY AT ANY PRICE AGAIN FLORINA EXACTED PERMISSION TO PASS THE NIGHT IN THE CHAMBER OF ECHOES AND AGAIN THE KING
8312-279791-0045 UNDISTURBED BY HER LAMENTATION SLEPT WITHOUT WAKING TILL DAWN THE THIRD DAY ONE OF THE PALACE VALETS PASSING HER BY SAID YOU STUPID PEASANT GIRL IT IS WELL THE KING TAKES OPIUM EVERY NIGHT
8312-279791-0046 OR YOU WOULD DISTURB HIM BY THAT TERRIBLE SOBBING OF YOURS DOES HE SO SAID THE QUEEN NOW COMPREHENDING ALL THEN IF YOU WILL PROMISE TO NIGHT TO KEEP THE OPIUM CUP OUT OF HIS WAY THESE PEARLS AND DIAMONDS
8312-279791-0047 AND SHE TOOK A HANDFUL OF THEM FROM HER SACK SHALL ASSUREDLY BE YOURS THE VALET PROMISED AND THEN FLORINA BROKE HER FOURTH EGG OUT OF WHICH CAME A PIE COMPOSED OF BIRDS WHICH THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN PLUCKED
8312-279791-0048 BAKED AND MADE READY FOR THE TABLE SANG AS BEAUTIFULLY AS BIRDS THAT ARE ALIVE TROUTINA CHARMED WITH THIS MARVELLOUS NOVELTY BOUGHT IT AT THE SAME PRICE AS THE REST ADDING GENEROUSLY A SMALL PIECE OF GOLD
8312-279791-0049 THEN HE ROSE UP DRESSED HIMSELF HASTILY AND WENT IN SEARCH OF HER SHE WAS SITTING MOURNFULLY ON THE FLOOR WITH HER HAIR HIDING HER FACE AND HER EYES SWOLLEN WITH TEARS BUT HE KNEW AT ONCE HIS FAITHFUL FLORINA
8312-279791-0050 AND THEY EMBRACED AND WEPT TOGETHER FOR WHAT WAS THE GOOD OF ALL THEIR LOVE WHEN THEY WERE STILL IN THE POWER OF THE FAIRY SOUSSIO BUT AT THIS MOMENT APPEARED THE FRIENDLY ENCHANTER WITH A FAIRY STILL GREATER THAN SOUSSIO
8312-279791-0051 THE ONE WHO HAD GIVEN FLORINA THE FOUR EGGS THEY DECLARED THAT THEIR UNITED POWER WAS STRONGER THAN SOUSSIO'S AND THAT THE LOVERS SHOULD BE MARRIED WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY WHEN THIS NEWS REACHED TROUTINA SHE RAN TO THE CHAMBER OF ECHOES
8312-279791-0052 AND THERE BEHELD HER BEAUTIFUL RIVAL WHOM SHE HAD SO CRUELLY AFFLICTED BUT THE MOMENT SHE OPENED HER MOUTH TO SPEAK HER WICKED TONGUE WAS SILENCED FOR EVER FOR THE MAGICIAN TURNED HER INTO A TROUT WHICH HE FLUNG OUT OF THE WINDOW
8312-279791-0053 THIS FAMILY LIKENESS MAY BE TRACED IN THE FAIRY TALES OF ALL COUNTRIES I MERELY REFER TO IT TO SHOW THAT THE REPETITION OF INCIDENTS WAS NOT UNOBSERVED OR UNINTENTIONAL
8324-286681-0000 TWO LITTLE CRAYFISHES QUARREL THE DAY AFTER THE EELS LEFT THE POND PEOPLE TALKED OF NOTHING ELSE IT WAS NOT THAT THEY WERE SO MUCH MISSED FOR THE EELS YOU KNOW DO NOT SWIM AROUND IN THE DAYTIME
8324-286681-0001 THE LARGER PEOPLE HAD BEEN SORRY TO HAVE THEM GO AND SOME OF THEM FELT THAT WITHOUT THE EELS AWAKE AND STIRRING THE POND WAS HARDLY A SAFE PLACE AT NIGHT I THINK IT IS A GOOD DEAL SAFER REMARKED A MINNOW WHO USUALLY SAID WHAT SHE THOUGHT
8324-286681-0002 OF COURSE I DO NOT KNOW WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK THEM SAID A STICKLEBACK WHY REPLIED THE MINNOW IF I HAD GONE TO THE EELS AND ASKED THEM THAT
8324-286681-0003 I HAVE HEARD SOME QUEER THINGS ABOUT THE EELS MYSELF SAID THE STICKLEBACK BUT I HAVE NEVER FELT MUCH AFRAID OF THEM I SUPPOSE I AM BRAVER BECAUSE I WEAR SO MANY OF MY BONES ON THE OUTSIDE JUST THEN
8324-286681-0004 A WISE OLD CRAYFISH CAME ALONG WALKING SIDEWISE
8324-286681-0005 THE CRAYFISH STUCK HIS TAIL INTO THE MUD HE OFTEN DID THIS WHEN HE WAS SURPRISED IT SEEMED TO HELP HIM THINK WHEN HE HAD THOUGHT FOR A WHILE HE WAVED HIS BIG PINCHING CLAWS AND SAID
8324-286681-0006 IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME NOT TO TELL WHAT I THINK I USED TO LIVE NEAR THEM THIS SHOWED THAT THE WISE OLD CRAYFISH HAD BEEN WELL BROUGHT UP AND KNEW HE SHOULD NOT SAY UNPLEASANT THINGS ABOUT PEOPLE IF HE COULD HELP IT
8324-286681-0007 WHEN THERE WAS NEED OF IT HE COULD TELL UNPLEASANT TRUTHS AND INDEED THAT VERY EVENING HE DID SAY WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE EELS THAT WAS WHEN HE WAS TEACHING SOME YOUNG CRAYFISHES HIS PUPILS
8324-286681-0008 THEIR MOTHER HAD BROUGHT UP A LARGE FAMILY AND WAS NOT STRONG SHE HAD JUST CAST THE SHELL WHICH SHE HAD WORN FOR A YEAR AND NOW SHE WAS WEAK AND HELPLESS UNTIL THE NEW ONE SHOULD HARDEN ON HER IT IS SUCH A BOTHER SHE SAID
8324-286681-0009 BUT IT IS A COMFORT TO THINK THAT THE NEW ONE WILL LAST A YEAR WHEN I DO GET IT WHILE THEIR MOTHER WAS SO WEAK THE WISE OLD CRAYFISH AMUSED THE CHILDREN AND TAUGHT THEM THINGS WHICH ALL CRAYFISHES SHOULD KNOW EVERY EVENING
8324-286681-0010 THEY GATHERED AROUND HIM SOME OF THEM SWIMMING TO HIM SOME WALKING FORWARD SOME SIDEWISE AND SOME BACKWARD IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THEM WHICH WAY THEY CAME THEY WERE RESTLESS PUPILS AND THEIR TEACHER COULD NOT KEEP THEM FROM LOOKING BEHIND THEM
8324-286681-0011 EACH ONE HAD SO MANY EYES THAT HE COULD LOOK AT THE TEACHER WITH A FEW AND AT THE OTHER LITTLE CRAYFISHES WITH A FEW MORE AND STILL HAVE A GOOD MANY EYES LEFT WITH WHICH TO WATCH THE TADPOLES THESE EYES WERE ARRANGED IN TWO BIG BUNCHES
8324-286681-0012 AND UNLESS YOU LOOKED VERY CLOSELY YOU MIGHT THINK THAT THEY HAD ONLY TWO EYES APIECE THEY HAD GOOD EARS AND THERE WERE ALSO FINE SMELLING BRISTLES GROWING FROM THEIR HEADS
8324-286681-0013 THAT HE HAD NOT SLEPT SO MUCH AS USUAL AND NOW WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WIDE AWAKE HE FELT EXCEEDINGLY DULL AND STUPID WHEN HE TRIED TO WALK HIS EIGHT LEGS STUMBLED OVER EACH OTHER
8324-286681-0014 AND THE WEAK WAY IN WHICH HE WAVED HIS PINCHING CLAW LEGS SHOWED HOW TIRED HE WAS AFTER HE HAD TOLD HIS PUPILS THE BEST WAY TO HOLD THEIR FOOD WITH THEIR PINCHING CLAWS
8324-286681-0015 ONE MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE FELLOW CALLED OUT I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE EELS MY MOTHER WOULD NEVER LET ME GO NEAR THEM AND NOW THEY'VE MOVED AWAY AND I WON'T EVER SEE THEM AND I THINK IT'S JUST HORRID EELS MY CHILDREN SAID THEIR TEACHER
8324-286681-0016 ARE LONG SLENDER SHARP NOSED SLIPPERY PEOPLE WITH A FRINGE OF FINS ALONG THEIR BACKS AND ANOTHER FRINGE ALONG THEIR BELLIES THEY BREATHE THROUGH VERY SMALL GILL OPENINGS IN THE BACKS OF THEIR HEADS
8324-286681-0017 THEY HAVE LARGE MOUTHS AND TEETH IN THEIR MOUTHS AND THEY ARE ALWAYS STICKING OUT THEIR LOWER JAWS AND HOW DO BEGAN THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH ASK ME THAT TO MORROW SAID THEIR TEACHER
8324-286681-0018 STRETCHING HIS EIGHT WALKING LEGS AND HIS TWO PINCHING CLAW LEGS AND HIS TAIL PADDLES BUT REMEMBER THIS ONE THING IF YOU EVER SEE AN EEL GET OUT OF HIS WAY DON'T STOP
8324-286681-0019 SAID ONE LITTLE CRAYFISH WHO THOUGHT IT SMART TO BE SAUCY WE'LL LOOK
8324-286681-0020 ALL OF WHICH MEANT NOTHING AT ALL AND WAS ONLY SAID TO ANNOY HIS TEACHER THEY SCRAMBLED AWAY OVER THE POND BOTTOM
8324-286681-0021 JIGGLING THE YOUNG CLAMS AND RACING WITH EACH OTHER WHERE THE BOTTOM WAS SMOOTH BEAT YOU RUNNING BACKWARD CRIED THE SAUCY CRAYFISH TO THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH AND THEY SCAMPERED ALONG BACKWARD IN THE MOONLIT WATER THERE WAS AN OLD LOG ON THE BOTTOM OF THE POND
8324-286681-0022 AND THEY SAT ON THAT TO REST THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH HAD BEATEN
8324-286681-0023 SAID THE SAUCY ONE POOH SAID THE BIGGEST ONE THAT'S ALL YOU KNOW THEY DON'T RUN ON LAND WELL I GUESS THEY DO REPLIED THE SAUCY ONE
8324-286681-0024 THAT THE EELS HAD COME BACK TO LIVE IN THE OLD POND AGAIN MOTHER EEL OPENED HER BIG MOUTH VERY WIDE ON LAND SHE SAID DECIDEDLY AS SHE SWALLOWED THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH EELS WRIGGLE
8324-286682-0000 THE LUCKY MINK DURING THE WARM WEATHER THE MINKS DID NOT COME OFTEN TO THE POND THEN THEY HAD TO STAY NEARER HOME AND CARE FOR THEIR BABIES IN THE WINTER WHEN FOOD WAS NOT SO PLENTIFUL
8324-286682-0001 AND THEIR YOUNGEST CHILDREN WERE OLD ENOUGH TO COME WITH THEM THEY VISITED THERE EVERY DAY IT WAS NOT FAR FROM THEIR HOME THE MINKS LIVED BY A WATERFALL IN THE RIVER AND HAD BURROWS IN THE BANKS
8324-286682-0002 WHERE THE YOUNG MINKS STAYED UNTIL THEY WERE LARGE ENOUGH TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD THEN THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS WERE VERY BUSY FOR IN EACH HOME THERE WERE FOUR OR FIVE OR SIX CHILDREN HUNGRY AND RESTLESS AND NEEDING TO BE TAUGHT MANY THINGS
8324-286682-0003 THEY WERE RELATED TO THE WEASELS WHO LIVED UP BY THE FARMYARD AND HAD THE SAME SLENDER AND ELEGANT BODIES AND SHORT LEGS AS THEY LIKE THE WEASELS THEY SOMETIMES CLIMBED TREES
8324-286682-0004 THEY DID MOST OF THEIR HUNTING IN THE RIVER SWIMMING WITH THEIR BODIES ALMOST ALL UNDER WATER AND DIVING AND TURNING AND TWISTING GRACEFULLY AND QUICKLY WHEN THEY HUNTED ON LAND THEY COULD TELL BY SMELLING JUST WHICH WAY TO GO FOR THEIR FOOD
8324-286682-0005 THE MINKS WERE A VERY DARK BROWN AND SCATTERED THROUGH THEIR CLOSE SOFT FUR WERE LONG SHINING HAIRS OF AN EVEN DARKER SHADE WHICH MADE THEIR COATS VERY BEAUTIFUL INDEED THE FUR WAS DARKER ON THEIR BACKS THAN ON THE UNDER PART OF THEIR BODIES
8324-286682-0006 AND THEIR TAPERING BUSHY TAILS WERE ALMOST BLACK THEIR UNDER JAWS WERE WHITE AND THEY WERE VERY PROUD OF THEM PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE THEY HAD SO LITTLE WHITE FUR THAT THEY THOUGHT SO MUCH OF IT YOU KNOW THAT IS OFTEN THE WAY
8324-286682-0007 WE THINK MOST OF THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE SCARCE OR HARD TO GET THERE WAS ONE OLD MINK BY THE RIVER WHO HAD A WHITE TIP ON HIS TAIL AND THAT IS SOMETHING WHICH MANY PEOPLE HAVE NEVER SEEN IT IS EVEN MORE UNCOMMON
8324-286682-0008 THAN FOR MINKS TO HAVE WHITE UPPER LIPS AND THAT HAPPENS ONLY ONCE IN A GREAT WHILE THIS MINK WAS A BACHELOR AND NOBODY KNEW WHY SOME PEOPLE SAID IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS WAITING TO FIND A WIFE WITH A WHITE TIP ON HER TAIL
8324-286682-0009 YET THAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOR HE WAS TOO WISE TO WAIT FOR SOMETHING WHICH MIGHT NEVER HAPPEN HOWEVER IT WAS HE LIVED ALONE AND FISHED AND HUNTED JUST FOR HIMSELF HE COULD DIVE MORE QUICKLY
8324-286682-0010 STAY UNDER WATER LONGER AND HUNT BY SCENT BETTER THAN ANY OTHER MINK ROUND THERE HIS FUR WAS SLEEKER AND MORE SHINING THAN THAT OF HIS FRIENDS AND IT IS NO WONDER THAT THE SISTERS OF HIS FRIENDS THOUGHT THAT HE OUGHT TO MARRY
8324-286682-0011 WHEN THE MINKS VISITED TOGETHER SOMEBODY WAS SURE TO SPEAK OF THE BACHELOR'S LUCK THEY SAID THAT WHATEVER HE DID HE WAS ALWAYS LUCKY IT IS ALL BECAUSE OF A WHITE TIP ON HIS TAIL THEY SAID
8324-286682-0012 THAT MAKES HIM LUCKY THE YOUNG MINKS HEARD THEIR FATHERS AND MOTHERS TALKING AND WISHED THAT THEY HAD BEEN BORN WITH WHITE TIPS ON THEIR TAILS SO THAT THEY COULD BE LUCKY TOO ONCE THE BACHELOR HEARD THEM WISHING THIS AND HE SMILED AND SHOWED HIS BEAUTIFUL TEETH
8324-286682-0013 AND TOLD THEM THAT IT WAS NOT THE TIP OF HIS TAIL
8324-286682-0014 AND THE BROTHERS WERE BIGGER THAN THE SISTERS AS MINK BROTHERS ALWAYS ARE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ALL THE SAME AGE ONE WAS VERY MUCH LARGER THAN ANY OF THE REST AND SO THEY CALLED HIM BIG BROTHER
8324-286682-0015 HE THOUGHT THERE WAS NEVER SUCH A FINE MINK AS THE BACHELOR AND HE USED TO FOLLOW HIM AROUND
8324-286682-0016 HE WISHED TO BE JUST LIKE HIM IN EVERY WAY BUT ONE HE DID NOT WANT TO BE A BACHELOR THE OTHER YOUNG MINKS LAUGHED AT BIG BROTHER AND ASKED HIM IF HE THOUGHT HIS TAIL WOULD TURN WHITE IF HE FOLLOWED THE BACHELOR LONG ENOUGH
8324-286682-0017 BIG BROTHER STOOD IT VERY PATIENTLY FOR A WHILE THEN HE SNARLED AT THEM AND SHOWED HIS TEETH WITHOUT SMILING AND SAID HE WOULD FIGHT ANYBODY WHO SPOKE ANOTHER WORD ABOUT IT MINKS ARE VERY BRAVE AND VERY FIERCE
8324-286682-0018 AND NEVER KNOW WHEN TO STOP IF THEY HAVE BEGUN TO FIGHT SO AFTER THAT NOBODY DARED TEASE BIG BROTHER BY SAYING ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THE BACHELOR SOMETIMES THEY DID LOOK AT HIS TAIL AND SMILE BUT THEY NEVER SPOKE
8324-286682-0019 AND HE PRETENDED NOT TO KNOW WHAT THEY MEANT BY IT A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS THE BACHELOR WAS CAUGHT IN A TRAP A COMMON CLUMSY WOODEN TRAP PUT TOGETHER WITH NAILS AND TWINE
8324-286682-0020 IT WAS NOT NEAR THE RIVER AND NONE OF HIS FRIENDS WOULD HAVE FOUND HIM IF BIG BROTHER HAD NOT HAPPENED ALONG HE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE WHAT HE SAW WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT A TRAP HAD DARED TO CATCH A MINK WITH A WHITE TIPPED TAIL
8324-286682-0021 THEN HE HEARD THE BACHELOR GROAN AND HE KNEW THAT IT WAS SO HE HURRIED UP TO WHERE THE TRAP WAS CAN'T YOU GET OUT SAID HE NO SAID THE BACHELOR I CAN'T THE BEST WAY TO GET
8324-286682-0022 OUT IS NOT TO GET IN AND I'VE GOTTEN IN CAN'T YOU DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR LUCKY TAIL TO MAKE THE TRAP OPEN ASKED BIG BROTHER I COULD DO SOMETHING WITH MY TEETH ANSWERED THE BACHELOR IF THEY WERE ONLY WHERE THE TIP OF MY TAIL IS
8324-286682-0023 WHY ARE MINKS ALWAYS WALKING INTO TRAPS HE WAS TRYING HARD NOT TO BE CROSS BUT HIS EYES SHOWED HOW HE FELT AND THAT WAS VERY CROSS INDEED THEN BIG BROTHER BECAME MUCH EXCITED
8324-286682-0024 I HAVE GOOD TEETH SAID HE TELL ME WHAT TO DO IF YOU WILL HELP ME OUT SAID THE BACHELOR I WILL GIVE YOU MY LUCK AND WHAT SHALL I DO WITH THE TAIL I HAVE ASKED THE YOUNG MINK
8324-286682-0025 WHO THOUGHT THAT THE BACHELOR WAS TO GIVE HIM HIS WHITE TIPPED TAIL NEVER MIND NOW ANSWERED THE BACHELOR AND HE TOLD THE YOUNG MINK JUST WHERE TO GNAW FOR A LONG TIME THERE WAS NO SOUND BUT THAT OF THE YOUNG MINK'S TEETH ON THE WOOD OF THE TRAP
8324-286682-0026 THE BACHELOR WAS TOO BRAVE TO GROAN OR MAKE A FUSS WHEN HE KNEW THERE WAS ANYBODY AROUND TO HEAR BIG BROTHER'S MOUTH BECAME VERY SORE AND HIS STOMACH BECAME VERY EMPTY BUT STILL HE KEPT AT WORK HE WAS AFRAID SOMEBODY WOULD
8324-286682-0027 COME FOR THE TRAP AND THE MINK IN IT BEFORE HE FINISHED NOW TRY IT SAID HE AFTER HE HAD GNAWED FOR QUITE A WHILE THE BACHELOR BACKED OUT AS FAR AS HE COULD BUT HIS BODY STUCK IN THE HOLE
8324-286682-0028 YOU ARE RUMPLING YOUR BEAUTIFUL FUR CRIED THE YOUNG MINK NEVER MIND THE FUR ANSWERED THE BACHELOR I CAN SMOOTH THAT DOWN AFTERWARD YOU WILL HAVE TO GNAW A LITTLE ON THIS SIDE
8324-286682-0029 AND HE RAISED ONE OF HIS HIND FEET TO SHOW WHERE HE MEANT IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL HINDFOOT THICKLY PADDED AND WITH SHORT PARTLY WEBBED TOES AND NO HAIR AT ALL GROWING BETWEEN THEM THE CLAWS WERE SHORT SHARP AND CURVED
8324-286682-0030 BIG BROTHER GNAWED AWAY NOW TRY IT SAID HE THE BACHELOR BACKED CAREFULLY OUT THROUGH THE OPENING AND STOOD THERE LOOKING TIRED AND HUNGRY AND VERY MUCH RUMPLED YOU ARE A FINE YOUNG MINK SAID HE
8324-286682-0031 WE WILL GET SOMETHING TO EAT AND THEN WE WILL SEE ABOUT MAKING YOU LUCKY THEY WENT TO THE RIVER BANK AND HAD A GOOD DINNER THE BACHELOR ATE MORE THAN BIG BROTHER FOR HIS MOUTH WAS NOT SORE BUT BIG BROTHER WAS VERY HAPPY
8324-286682-0032 HE THOUGHT HOW HANDSOME HE WOULD LOOK WITH A WHITE TIPPED TAIL AND HOW AFTER HE HAD THAT HE COULD SURELY MARRY WHOEVER HE WISHED IT WAS THE CUSTOM AMONG HIS PEOPLE TO WANT TO MARRY THE BEST LOOKING AND STRONGEST
8324-286682-0033 INDEED IT IS SO AMONG ALL THE POND PEOPLE AND THAT IS ONE REASON WHY THEY CARE SO MUCH ABOUT BEING GOOD LOOKING IT IS VERY HARD FOR A YOUNG MINK TO HAVE THE ONE HE LOVES CHOOSE SOMEBODY ELSE JUST BECAUSE THE OTHER FELLOW
8324-286682-0034 HAS THE BUSHIEST TAIL OR THE LONGEST FUR OR THE THICKEST PADS ON HIS FEET NOW SAID THE BACHELOR WE WILL TALK ABOUT LUCK WE WILL GO TO A PLACE WHERE NOBODY CAN HEAR WHAT WE SAY
8324-286682-0035 THEY FOUND SUCH A PLACE AND LAY DOWN THE BACHELOR ROLLED OVER THREE TIMES AND SMOOTHED HIS FUR HE WAS STILL SO TIRED FROM BEING IN THE TRAP THEN HE LOOKED AT THE YOUNG MINK VERY SHARPLY SO YOU WANT MY TAIL
8324-286682-0036 SAID HE YOU SAID YOU WOULD GIVE ME YOUR LUCK ANSWERED BIG BROTHER AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT YOUR LUCK IS IN YOUR TAIL THE BACHELOR SMILED WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH THE TAIL YOU HAVE SAID HE
8324-286682-0037 I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED BIG BROTHER YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO WEAR TWO ASKED THE BACHELOR OH NO ANSWERED BIG BROTHER
8324-286682-0038 WELL HOW WILL YOU PUT MY TAIL IN PLACE OF YOURS ASKED THE BACHELOR I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED THE YOUNG MINK BUT YOU ARE SO WISE THAT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT KNOW SOME WAY
8324-286682-0039 HE BEGAN TO FEEL DISCOURAGED AND TO THINK THAT THE BACHELOR'S OFFER DIDN'T MEAN VERY MUCH AFTER ALL DON'T YOU THINK SAID THE BACHELOR SLOWLY DON'T YOU THINK THAT IF YOU COULD HAVE MY LUCK
8324-286682-0040 YOU COULD GET ALONG PRETTY WELL WITH YOUR OWN TAIL WHY YES SAID THE YOUNG MINK WHO HAD BEGUN TO FEAR HE WAS NOT GOING TO GET ANYTHING YES BUT HOW COULD THAT BE
8324-286682-0041 THE BACHELOR SMILED AGAIN I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE SAID HE THAT MY LUCK IS NOT IN MY TAIL AND THEY NEVER BELIEVE IT I WILL TELL YOU THE SECRET OF MY LUCK
8324-286682-0042 AND YOU CAN HAVE LUCK LIKE IT IF YOU REALLY CARE ENOUGH HE LOOKED ALL AROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY WAS NEAR AND HE LISTENED VERY CAREFULLY WITH THE TWO LITTLE ROUND EARS THAT WERE ALMOST HIDDEN IN HIS HEAD FUR THEN HE WHISPERED TO BIG BROTHER
8324-286682-0043 THIS IS THE SECRET ALWAYS DO EVERYTHING A LITTLE BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE CAN IS THAT ALL
8324-286682-0044 THAT IS ENOUGH ANSWERED THE BACHELOR KEEP TRYING AND TRYING AND TRYING UNTIL YOU CAN DIVE DEEPER STAY UNDER WATER LONGER RUN FASTER
8324-286682-0045 THEN YOU WILL HAVE GOOD LUCK WHEN THEIRS IS POOR YOU WILL HAVE PLENTY TO EAT WHEN THEY ARE HUNGRY YOU CAN BEAT IN EVERY FIGHT YOU CAN HAVE SLEEK SHINING FUR
8324-286682-0046 SAID HE WHEN I HAVE LEARNED TO DO EVERYTHING IN THE VERY BEST WAY IT WILL BE LUCK OF MY OWN OF COURSE ANSWERED THE BACHELOR
8324-286682-0047 THEN IT IS A KIND OF LUCK THAT CANNOT BE LOST IF I CARRIED MINE IN THE TIP OF MY TAIL SOMEBODY MIGHT BITE IT OFF AND LEAVE ME UNLUCKY BIG BROTHER KEPT THE SECRET
8324-286682-0048 AND WORKED UNTIL HE HAD LEARNED TO BE AS LUCKY AS THE BACHELOR THEN HE MARRIED THE PERSON HE WANTED AND SHE WAS VERY VERY HANDSOME IT IS SAID THAT ONE OF THEIR SONS HAS A WHITE TIPPED TAIL
8324-286683-0000 ONE WARM DAY IN WINTER WHEN SOME OF THE PUSSY WILLOWS MADE A MISTAKE AND BEGAN TO GROW BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT SPRING HAD COME A PARTY OF MUSKRATS WERE VISITING IN THE MARSH BESIDE THE POND ALL AROUND THEM WERE THEIR WINTER HOUSES BUILT OF MUD AND COARSE GRASSES
8324-286683-0001 THESE HOMES LOOKED LIKE HEAPS OF DRIED RUSHES UNLESS ONE WENT CLOSE TO THEM IF ONE DID THAT HE COULD PLAINLY SEE WHAT THEY WERE AND IF ONE HAPPENED TO BE A MUSKRAT AND COULD DIVE AND GO INTO THEM THROUGH THEIR WATERY DOORWAYS
8324-286683-0002 AND ARE AWAKE AT NIGHT WE WISH IT WOULD ALWAYS BE WARM WEATHER SAID THE YOUNG MUSKRATS WHAT'S THE USE OF WINTER HARD TO TELL ANSWERED ONE MUSKRAT
8324-286683-0003 WHO HAD LIVED IN THE MARSH LONGER THAN THE REST HARD TO TELL I KNOW IT ALWAYS GIVES ME A GOOD APPETITE THOUGH THEN ALL THE MUSKRATS LAUGHED THEY WERE A JOLLY GOOD NATURED COMPANY AND EASY TO GET ALONG WITH
8324-286683-0004 THE OTHER POND PEOPLE LIKED THEM MUCH BETTER THAN THEY DID THEIR NEIGHBORS THE MINKS THE WILD DUCKS WHO NESTED IN THE SEDGES WERE QUITE WILLING THAT THE YOUNG MUSKRATS SHOULD PLAY WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND THE MUD HENS WERE NOT AFRAID OF THEM
8324-286683-0005 MUD HENS CANNOT BEAR MINKS THEY SAY THAT WHEN A MUD CHICKEN IS MISSING FROM THE NEST
8324-286683-0006 IN SPRING AND SUMMER WHEN THEY CAN FIND FRESH GRASSES AND YOUNG RUSHES OR A FEW PARSNIPS CARROTS AND TURNIPS FROM THE FARMERS FIELDS OTHER ANIMALS ARE QUITE SAFE IN THE WINTER THEY LIVE MOSTLY ON ROOTS
8324-286683-0007 YES GREAT PITY CHUCKLED THE OLD MUSKRAT HOW GLAD YOU WOULD BE TO SEE THEM HE SMILED ALL AROUND HIS LITTLE MOUTH AND SHOWED HIS GNAWING TEETH
8324-286683-0008 HE KNEW THAT THE FROGS WERE BETTER OFF ASLEEP IN THE MUD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE POND THAN THEY WOULD BE SITTING IN THE SUNSHINE WITH A FEW HUNGRY GULLS ABOVE THEM THE TURTLES WERE SLEEPING ALL WINTER TOO
8324-286683-0009 THE EELS WERE LYING AT THE BOTTOM STUPID AND DROWSY AND SOMEWHERE THE WATER ADDERS WERE HIDDEN AWAY DREAMING OF SPRING OF ALL THE BIRDS WHO LIVED BY THE WATER ONLY THE GULLS WERE THERE AND THEY WERE NOT POPULAR
8324-286683-0010 IT IS TRUE THAT THEY HELPED KEEP THE POND SWEET AND CLEAN AND PICKED UP AND CARRIED AWAY MANY THINGS WHICH MADE THE SHORE UNTIDY STILL THEY WERE RUDE AND TALKED TOO LOUDLY AND WORE THEIR FEATHERS IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY LOOKED LIKE FINE LARGE BIRDS
8324-286683-0011 THE OTHER POND PEOPLE SAID THAT WAS JUST LIKE THEM ALWAYS PRETENDING TO BE MORE THAN THEY REALLY WERE FIFTEEN YOUNG MUSKRATS ALL BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND ALL BORN THE SUMMER BEFORE STARTED OFF TO LOOK AT THE OLD HOME
8324-286683-0012 WHERE THEY WERE CHILDREN TOGETHER THAT IS TO SAY
8324-286683-0013 AND WHEN THEY WERE OLD ENOUGH TO LOOK OUT FOR THEMSELVES FIVE MORE CAME TO LIVE IN THE OLD NEST AND WHEN THESE WERE OLD ENOUGH TO LEAVE THE NEST ANOTHER FIVE WERE BORN IT DOESN'T MEAN SO MUCH TO MUSKRATS TO BE BROTHERS AND SISTERS AS IT DOES TO SOME PEOPLE
8324-286683-0014 AND TO HEAR THEM SLAP THEIR LONG SCALY TAILS ON THE WATER WHEN THEY DOVE THEY HAD SHORT DOWNY FUR ALMOST BLACK ON THE BACK SOFT GRAY UNDERNEATH AND A REDDISH BROWN EVERYWHERE ELSE
8324-286683-0015 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE FUR ON THEIR TAILS OR ON THEIR FEET AND THOSE PARTS WERE BLACK THESE FIFTEEN CHILDREN HAD BEEN FAIRLY WELL BROUGHT UP BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT THEIR MOTHER HAD MANY CARES
8324-286683-0016 SO IT IS NOT STRANGE IF THEY SOMETIMES BEHAVED BADLY IN SOME OTHER FAMILIES WHERE THERE WERE ONLY NINE OR TEN BABIES ALL THE SEASON THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP MORE STRICTLY
8324-286683-0017 LIKE ALL YOUNG MUSKRATS THEY WERE FULL OF FUN AND THERE WERE FEW PLEASANTER SIGHTS THAN TO SEE THEM FROLICKING ON A WARM MOONLIGHT EVENING WHEN THEY LOOKED LIKE BROWN BALLS ROLLING AND BOUNDING AROUND ON THE SHORE OR PLUNGING INTO THE WATER
8324-286683-0018 IF THEY HAD ALL BEEN EXACTLY THE SAME AGE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN PLEASANTER FOR THE OLDEST FIVE WOULD PUT ON AIRS AND CALL THE OTHERS THE CHILDREN AND THE NEXT FIVE WOULD CALL THE YOUNGEST FIVE
8324-286683-0019 BABIES ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ALL WELL GROWN THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR THE YOUNGEST FIVE TO CALL OTHER MUSKRATS BABIES SO WHEN THEY WERE WARM AND WELL FED AND GOOD NATURED THEY LAUGHED AND SAID WHO CARES
8324-286683-0020 WHEN THEY WERE COLD AND HUNGRY THEY SLAPPED THEIR TAILS ON THE GROUND OR ON THE WATER AND SAID DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE SMART
8324-286683-0021 SHE WOULD SAY NOW CHILDREN IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY HAD TO STOP
8324-286683-0022 TEASING IS NOT SO VERY BAD YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH IT IS DREADFULLY SILLY BUT WHEN PEOPLE BEGIN BY TEASING THEY SOMETIMES GET TO SAYING THINGS IN EARNEST EVEN REALLY HATEFUL MEAN THINGS
8324-286683-0023 AND THAT WAS WHAT MADE THE MUSKRAT FATHER AND MOTHER STOP IT WHENEVER THEY COULD NOW THE WHOLE FIFTEEN CROWDED AROUND THE OLD SUMMER HOME AND SOME OF THEM WENT IN ONE WAY AND SOME OF THEM WENT IN ANOTHER
8324-286683-0024 FOR EVERY MUSKRAT'S SUMMER HOUSE HAS SEVERAL BURROWS LEADING TO IT WHEN THEY REACHED THE OLD NEST AT THE END ALL OF THEM TRIED TO GET IN AT ONCE AND THEY PUSHED EACH OTHER AROUND WITH THEIR BROAD LITTLE HEADS
8324-286683-0025 SCRAMBLED AND CLUTCHED AND HELD ON WITH THEIR STRONG LITTLE FEET FIVE OF THEM SAID IT'S OUR TURN FIRST WE'RE THE OLDEST AND FIVE MORE SAID WELL IT'S OUR TURN NEXT ANYWAY CAUSE WE'RE NEXT OLDEST
8324-286683-0026 THE OTHERS SAID YOU MIGHT GIVE UP TO US BECAUSE WE'RE THE YOUNGEST THEY PUSHED AND SCRAMBLED SOME MORE AND ONE OF THE YOUNGEST CHILDREN SAID TO ONE OF THE OLDEST WELL I DON'T CARE I'M JUST AS BIG AS YOU ARE
8324-286683-0027 WHICH WAS SO AND THE OLDER ONE ANSWERED BACK WELL YOU'RE NOT SO GOOD LOOKING WHICH WAS ALSO TRUE THEN PART OF THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS
8324-286683-0028 TOOK SIDES WITH ONE AND PART TOOK SIDES WITH THE OTHER WHAT HAD BEEN A LOVELY FROLIC BECAME AN UNPLEASANT DISGRACEFUL QUARREL AND THEY SAID SUCH THINGS AS THESE
8324-286683-0029 YOU SLAPPED YOUR TAIL ON MY BACK
8324-286683-0030 OR THE HALF WAY BETWEEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHOULD GO FIRST INTO THE OLD NEST AND IT DIDN'T MATTER A BIT WHO WAS OLDEST OR WHO WAS YOUNGEST AND IT NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THEIR DREADFUL HABIT OF TEASING
8324-286683-0031 BUT THEY WERE TOO MUCH EXCITED TO MIND AND THEY DID NOT STOP UNTIL THEIR FATHER CAME AND SLAPPED THEM WITH HIS TAIL THEN THEY KEPT STILL AND LISTENED TO THEIR MOTHER
8324-286683-0032 SHE TOLD THEM THAT THEY SHOULD LEAVE THE PLACE AT ONCE AND NOT ONE OF THEM SHOULD EVEN SET FOOT IN THE OLD NEST SUPPOSE SOMEBODY HAD GOTTEN HURT SHE SAID THIS MADE THE YOUNG MUSKRATS LOOK VERY SOBER
8324-286683-0033 FOR THEY KNEW THAT THE MUSKRAT WHO IS HURT IN WINTER NEVER GETS WELL AFTER SHE HAD LET THEM THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A WHILE SHE SAID I SHALL PUNISH YOU ALL FOR THIS
8324-286683-0034 THEN THERE WAS NO QUARREL AMONG HER CHILDREN TO SEE WHO SHOULD HAVE THE FIRST TURN NOT AT ALL ONE YOUNG MUSKRAT SAID AREN'T YOU GOING TO LET US PLAY ANY MORE YES
8324-286683-0035 BUT I SHALL CHOOSE THE GAMES THE OLDEST FIVE WILL PLAY MUD TURTLES IN WINTER THE NEXT FIVE WILL PLAY FROGS IN WINTER AND THE YOUNGEST FIVE WILL PLAY SNAKES IN WINTER
8324-286683-0036 THE WAY TO PLAY THESE GAMES IS TO LIE PERFECTLY STILL IN SOME DARK PLACE AND NOT SAY A WORD THE YOUNG MUSKRATS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER SORROWFULLY
8324-286683-0037 THEY THOUGHT IT SOUNDED VERY MUCH THE SAME AS BEING SENT TO BED FOR BEING NAUGHTY THEY DID NOT DARE SAY ANYTHING FOR THEY KNEW THAT ALTHOUGH THEIR MOTHER WAS GENTLE AS MUSKRATS ARE MOST OF THE TIME SHE COULD BE VERY SEVERE
8324-286683-0038 SO THEY WENT AWAY QUIETLY TO PLAY WHAT SHE HAD TOLD THEM THEY MUST BUT IT WAS NOT MUCH FUN TO PLAY THOSE GAMES WHEN ALL THE OTHERS WERE HAVING A FINE TIME IN THE SUNSHINE
839-130898-0000 IN LATITUDE FORTY SEVEN DEGREES
839-130898-0001 AND LONGITUDE SEVENTEEN DEGREES
839-130898-0002 IN THE AFTERMATH OF THIS STORM WE WERE THROWN BACK TO THE EAST AWAY WENT ANY HOPE OF ESCAPING TO THE LANDING PLACES OF NEW YORK OR THE SAINT LAWRENCE IN DESPAIR
839-130898-0003 POOR NED WENT INTO SECLUSION LIKE CAPTAIN NEMO CONSEIL AND I NO LONGER LEFT EACH OTHER AS I SAID THE NAUTILUS VEERED TO THE EAST TO BE MORE ACCURATE I SHOULD HAVE SAID TO THE NORTHEAST
839-130898-0004 SOMETIMES BENEATH THEM THE SHIP WANDERED FOR DAYS AMID THESE MISTS SO FEARED BY NAVIGATORS THESE ARE CAUSED CHIEFLY BY MELTING ICE WHICH KEEPS THE AIR EXTREMELY DAMP
839-130898-0005 HOW MANY SHIPS HAVE PERISHED IN THESE WATERWAYS AS THEY TRIED TO GET DIRECTIONS FROM THE HAZY LIGHTS ON THE COAST HOW MANY CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THESE OPAQUE MISTS HOW MANY COLLISIONS HAVE OCCURRED WITH THESE REEFS
839-130898-0006 WHERE THE BREAKING SURF IS COVERED BY THE NOISE OF THE WIND HOW MANY VESSELS HAVE RAMMED EACH OTHER
839-130898-0007 SO THE FLOOR OF THIS SEA HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A BATTLEFIELD WHERE EVERY SHIP DEFEATED
839-130898-0008 OTHERS NEWER AND REFLECTING OUR BEACON LIGHT ON THEIR IRONWORK AND COPPER UNDERSIDES AMONG THESE VESSELS HOW MANY WENT DOWN WITH ALL HANDS WITH THEIR CREWS AND HOSTS OF IMMIGRANTS
839-130898-0009 AT THESE TROUBLE SPOTS SO PROMINENT IN THE STATISTICS CAPE RACE SAINT PAUL ISLAND THE STRAIT OF BELLE ISLE THE SAINT LAWRENCE ESTUARY
839-130898-0010 AND IN ONLY A FEW YEARS HOW MANY VICTIMS HAVE BEEN FURNISHED TO THE OBITUARY NOTICES BY THE ROYAL MAIL INMAN AND MONTREAL LINES BY VESSELS NAMED THE SOLWAY THE ISIS THE PARAMATTA
839-130898-0011 THE HUNGARIAN THE CANADIAN THE ANGLO SAXON THE HUMBOLDT
839-130898-0012 ALL RUN AGROUND BY THE ARCTIC AND THE LYONNAIS SUNK IN COLLISIONS BY THE PRESIDENT THE PACIFIC AND THE CITY OF GLASGOW
839-130898-0013 OF THEIR GLOOMY RUBBLE THE NAUTILUS NAVIGATED
839-130898-0014 BY MAY FIFTEENTH WE WERE OFF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF THE GRAND BANKS OF NEWFOUNDLAND THESE BANKS ARE THE RESULT OF MARINE SEDIMENTATION AN EXTENSIVE ACCUMULATION OF ORGANIC WASTE
839-130898-0015 BROUGHT EITHER FROM THE EQUATOR BY THE GULF STREAM'S CURRENT OR FROM THE NORTH POLE BY THE COUNTERCURRENT OF COLD WATER THAT SKIRTS THE AMERICAN COAST HERE TOO ERRATICALLY DRIFTING CHUNKS COLLECT FROM THE ICE BREAKUP
839-130898-0016 HERE A HUGE BONEYARD FORMS FROM FISH MOLLUSKS
839-130898-0017 DYING OVER IT BY THE BILLIONS THE SEA IS OF NO GREAT DEPTH AT THE GRAND BANKS A FEW HUNDRED FATHOMS AT BEST BUT TO THE SOUTH THERE IS A DEEP
839-130898-0018 SUDDENLY OCCURRING DEPRESSION A THREE THOUSAND METER PIT HERE THE GULF STREAM WIDENS
839-130898-0019 A ONE METER LUMPFISH BLACKISH ON TOP
839-130898-0020 AND RARE AMONG ITS BRETHREN IN THAT IT PRACTICES MONOGAMY A GOOD SIZED EELPOUT A TYPE OF EMERALD MORAY WHOSE FLAVOR IS EXCELLENT WOLFFISH WITH BIG EYES
839-130898-0021 VIVIPAROUS BLENNIES WHOSE EGGS HATCH INSIDE THEIR BODIES LIKE THOSE OF SNAKES BLOATED GOBIO
839-130898-0022 MEASURING TWO DECIMETERS GRENADIERS WITH LONG TAILS AND GLEAMING WITH A SILVERY GLOW SPEEDY FISH VENTURING FAR FROM THEIR HIGH ARCTIC SEAS OUR NETS ALSO HAULED IN A BOLD
839-130898-0023 DARING VIGOROUS AND MUSCULAR FISH ARMED WITH PRICKLES ON ITS HEAD AND STINGS ON ITS FINS A REAL SCORPION MEASURING TWO TO THREE METERS THE RUTHLESS ENEMY
839-130898-0024 BLENNIES AND SALMON IT WAS THE BULLHEAD OF THE NORTHERLY SEAS A FISH WITH RED FINS AND A BROWN BODY COVERED WITH NODULES
839-130898-0025 THE NAUTILUS'S FISHERMEN HAD SOME TROUBLE GETTING A GRIP ON THIS ANIMAL WHICH THANKS TO THE FORMATION OF ITS GILL COVERS
839-130898-0026 CAN PROTECT ITS RESPIRATORY ORGANS FROM ANY PARCHING CONTACT WITH THE AIR AND CAN LIVE OUT OF WATER FOR A GOOD WHILE AND I'LL MENTION FOR THE RECORD SOME LITTLE BANDED BLENNIES
839-130898-0027 THAT FOLLOW SHIPS INTO THE NORTHERNMOST SEAS SHARP SNOUTED CARP EXCLUSIVE TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC SCORPIONFISH AND LASTLY
839-130898-0028 CHIEFLY THE COD SPECIES WHICH I DETECTED IN THEIR WATERS OF CHOICE OVER THESE INEXHAUSTIBLE GRAND BANKS BECAUSE NEWFOUNDLAND IS SIMPLY AN UNDERWATER PEAK
839-130898-0029 YOU COULD CALL THESE COD MOUNTAIN FISH WHILE THE NAUTILUS WAS CLEARING A PATH THROUGH THEIR TIGHT RANKS
839-130898-0030 MERCY LOOK AT THESE COD HE SAID WHY I THOUGHT COD WERE FLAT LIKE DAB OR SOLE
839-130898-0031 AND SPREAD OUT ON DISPLAY BUT IN THE WATER THEY'RE LIKE MULLET SPINDLE SHAPED AND PERFECTLY BUILT FOR SPEED I CAN EASILY BELIEVE MASTER CONSEIL REPLIED BUT WHAT CROWDS OF THEM WHAT SWARMS
839-130898-0032 BAH MY FRIEND THERE'D BE MANY MORE WITHOUT THEIR ENEMIES SCORPIONFISH AND HUMAN BEINGS DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY EGGS HAVE BEEN COUNTED IN A SINGLE FEMALE I'LL GO ALL OUT CONSEIL REPLIED
839-130898-0033 FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ELEVEN MILLION MY FRIEND ELEVEN MILLION I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THAT UNTIL I COUNT THEM MYSELF SO COUNT THEM CONSEIL
839-130898-0034 BUT IT WOULD BE LESS WORK TO BELIEVE ME BESIDES FRENCHMEN ENGLISHMEN AMERICANS DANES AND NORWEGIANS CATCH THESE COD BY THE THOUSANDS THEY'RE EATEN IN PRODIGIOUS QUANTITIES AND WITHOUT
839-130898-0035 THE SEAS WOULD SOON BE DEPOPULATED OF THEM ACCORDINGLY IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA ALONE FIVE THOUSAND SHIPS MANNED BY SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND SEAMEN GO AFTER COD EACH SHIP BRINGS BACK AN AVERAGE CATCH
839-130898-0036 OF FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FISH MAKING TWENTY TWO MILLION OFF THE COAST OF NORWAY
839-130898-0037 THE TOTAL IS THE SAME FINE CONSEIL REPLIED I'LL TAKE MASTER'S WORD FOR IT I WON'T COUNT THEM COUNT WHAT THOSE ELEVEN MILLION EGGS BUT I'LL MAKE ONE COMMENT
839-130898-0038 WHAT'S THAT IF ALL THEIR EGGS HATCHED JUST FOUR CODFISH COULD FEED ENGLAND AMERICA AND NORWAY AS WE SKIMMED THE DEPTHS OF THE GRAND BANKS
839-130898-0039 I COULD SEE PERFECTLY THOSE LONG FISHING LINES EACH ARMED WITH TWO HUNDRED HOOKS THAT EVERY BOAT DANGLED BY THE DOZENS THE LOWER END OF EACH LINE DRAGGED THE BOTTOM BY MEANS OF A SMALL GRAPPLING IRON
839-130898-0040 OF A CORK FLOAT THE NAUTILUS HAD TO MANEUVER SHREWDLY IN THE MIDST OF THIS UNDERWATER SPIDERWEB BUT THE SHIP DIDN'T STAY LONG IN THESE HEAVILY TRAVELED WATERWAYS IT WENT UP TO ABOUT LATITUDE FORTY TWO DEGREES
839-130898-0041 THIS BROUGHT IT ABREAST OF SAINT JOHN'S IN NEWFOUNDLAND AND HEART'S CONTENT WHERE THE ATLANTIC CABLE REACHES ITS END POINT INSTEAD OF CONTINUING NORTH THE NAUTILUS TOOK AN EASTERLY HEADING
839-130898-0042 AS IF TO GO ALONG THIS PLATEAU ON WHICH THE TELEGRAPH CABLE RESTS WHERE MULTIPLE SOUNDINGS HAVE GIVEN THE CONTOURS OF THE TERRAIN WITH THE UTMOST ACCURACY IT WAS ON MAY SEVENTEENTH
839-130898-0043 ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILES FROM HEART'S CONTENT
839-130898-0044 THAT I SPOTTED THIS CABLE LYING ON THE SEAFLOOR CONSEIL WHOM I HADN'T ALERTED MISTOOK IT AT FIRST FOR A GIGANTIC SEA SNAKE AND WAS GEARING UP TO CLASSIFY IT IN HIS BEST MANNER
839-130898-0045 THE FINE LAD AND LET HIM DOWN GENTLY BY GIVING HIM VARIOUS DETAILS ON THE LAYING OF THIS CABLE THE FIRST CABLE WAS PUT DOWN DURING THE YEARS EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT BUT
839-130898-0046 AFTER TRANSMITTING ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED TELEGRAMS IT WENT DEAD IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE ENGINEERS BUILT A NEW CABLE THAT MEASURED
839-130898-0047 FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED METRIC TONS AND WAS SHIPPED ABOARD THE GREAT EASTERN THIS ATTEMPT ALSO FAILED NOW THEN
839-130898-0048 ON MAY TWENTY FIFTH WHILE SUBMERGED TO A DEPTH OF THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SIX METERS THE NAUTILUS LAY IN PRECISELY THE LOCALITY WHERE THIS SECOND CABLE SUFFERED THE RUPTURE THAT RUINED THE UNDERTAKING
839-130898-0049 THE ELECTRICIANS ON BOARD DECIDED TO CUT THE CABLE BEFORE FISHING IT UP AND BY ELEVEN O'CLOCK THAT EVENING THEY HAD RETRIEVED THE DAMAGED PART THEY REPAIRED THE JOINT AND ITS SPLICE
839-130898-0050 THEN THE CABLE WAS RESUBMERGED BUT A FEW DAYS LATER IT SNAPPED AGAIN AND COULDN'T BE RECOVERED FROM THE OCEAN DEPTHS
839-130898-0051 WHO HAD RISKED HIS WHOLE FORTUNE TO PROMOTE THIS UNDERTAKING CALLED FOR A NEW BOND ISSUE IT SOLD OUT IMMEDIATELY
839-130898-0052 WHICH WAS PROTECTED BY A PADDING OF TEXTILE MATERIAL ENCLOSED IN A METAL SHEATH THE GREAT EASTERN PUT BACK TO SEA ON JULY THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX
839-130898-0053 YET THERE WAS ONE HITCH AS THEY GRADUALLY UNROLLED THIS THIRD CABLE THE ELECTRICIANS OBSERVED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THAT SOMEONE HAD RECENTLY DRIVEN NAILS INTO IT TRYING TO DAMAGE ITS CORE
839-130898-0054 CAPTAIN ANDERSON HIS OFFICERS AND THE ENGINEERS PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER THEN POSTED A WARNING
839-130898-0055 WITHOUT A TRIAL AFTER THAT THESE VILLAINOUS ATTEMPTS WERE NOT REPEATED BY JULY TWENTY THIRD THE GREAT EASTERN WAS LYING NO FARTHER THAN EIGHT HUNDRED KILOMETERS FROM NEWFOUNDLAND
839-130898-0056 WHEN IT RECEIVED TELEGRAPHED NEWS FROM IRELAND
839-130898-0057 SIGNED BETWEEN PRUSSIA AND AUSTRIA AFTER THE BATTLE OF SADOVA THROUGH THE MISTS ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH IT SIGHTED THE PORT OF HEART'S CONTENT
839-130898-0058 HAD ENDED HAPPILY AND IN ITS FIRST DISPATCH YOUNG AMERICA ADDRESSED OLD EUROPE WITH THESE WISE WORDS SO RARELY UNDERSTOOD GLORY TO GOD IN THE HIGHEST AND PEACE ON EARTH TO MEN OF GOOD WILL
839-130898-0059 I DIDN'T EXPECT TO FIND THIS ELECTRIC CABLE IN MINT CONDITION AS IT LOOKED ON LEAVING ITS PLACE OF MANUFACTURE THE LONG SNAKE WAS COVERED WITH SEASHELL RUBBLE AND BRISTLING WITH
839-130898-0060 A CRUST OF CAKED GRAVEL PROTECTED IT FROM ANY MOLLUSKS THAT MIGHT BORE INTO IT IT RESTED SERENELY SHELTERED FROM THE SEA'S MOTIONS UNDER A PRESSURE FAVORABLE TO THE TRANSMISSION
839-130898-0061 THAT GOES FROM AMERICA TO EUROPE
839-130898-0062 THIS CABLE WILL NO DOUBT LAST INDEFINITELY BECAUSE AS OBSERVERS NOTE
839-130898-0063 BESIDES ON THIS WELL CHOSEN PLATEAU THE CABLE NEVER LIES AT DEPTHS THAT COULD CAUSE A BREAK THE NAUTILUS
839-130898-0064 TO ITS LOWEST REACHES LOCATED FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY ONE METERS DOWN
839-130898-0065 THEN WE RETURNED TO THE LOCALITY WHERE THE EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE ACCIDENT HAD TAKEN PLACE THERE THE OCEAN FLOOR FORMED A VALLEY
839-130898-0066 ONE HUNDRED TWENTY KILOMETERS WIDE INTO WHICH YOU COULD FIT MT BLANC WITHOUT ITS SUMMIT POKING ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES THIS VALLEY IS CLOSED OFF TO THE EAST BY A SHEER WALL
839-130898-0067 TWO THOUSAND METERS HIGH WE ARRIVED THERE ON MAY TWENTY EIGHTH AND THE NAUTILUS
839-130898-0068 HEAD UP NORTH AND BEACH US ON THE BRITISH ISLES NO MUCH TO MY SURPRISE HE WENT BACK DOWN SOUTH AND RETURNED TO EUROPEAN SEAS AS WE SWUNG AROUND THE EMERALD ISLE
839-130898-0069 I SPOTTED CAPE CLEAR FOR AN INSTANT PLUS THE LIGHTHOUSE ON FASTNET ROCK THAT GUIDES ALL THOSE THOUSANDS OF SHIPS SETTING OUT FROM GLASGOW OR LIVERPOOL AN IMPORTANT QUESTION THEN POPPED INTO MY HEAD
839-130898-0070 WOULD THE NAUTILUS DARE TO TACKLE THE ENGLISH CHANNEL NED LAND WHO PROMPTLY REAPPEARED AFTER WE HUGGED SHORE NEVER STOPPED QUESTIONING ME WHAT COULD I ANSWER HIM
839-130898-0071 AFTER GIVING THE CANADIAN A GLIMPSE OF AMERICAN SHORES WAS HE ABOUT TO SHOW ME THE COAST OF FRANCE BUT THE NAUTILUS KEPT GRAVITATING SOUTHWARD ON MAY THIRTIETH
839-130898-0072 IN SIGHT OF LAND'S END IT PASSED BETWEEN THE LOWERMOST TIP OF ENGLAND AND THE SCILLY ISLANDS WHICH IT LEFT BEHIND TO STARBOARD IF IT WAS GOING TO ENTER THE ENGLISH CHANNEL
839-130898-0073 IT CLEARLY NEEDED TO HEAD EAST IT DID NOT ALL DAY LONG ON MAY THIRTY FIRST THE NAUTILUS SWEPT AROUND THE SEA IN A SERIES OF CIRCLES
839-130898-0074 THAT HAD ME DEEPLY PUZZLED IT SEEMED TO BE SEARCHING FOR A LOCALITY THAT IT HAD SOME TROUBLE FINDING AT NOON
839-130898-0075 HE DIDN'T ADDRESS A WORD TO ME HE LOOKED GLOOMIER THAN EVER WHAT WAS FILLING HIM WITH SUCH SADNESS WAS IT OUR PROXIMITY TO THESE EUROPEAN SHORES WAS HE RELIVING HIS MEMORIES OF THAT COUNTRY
839-130898-0076 HE HAD LEFT BEHIND IF SO WHAT DID HE FEEL REMORSE OR REGRET FOR A GOOD WHILE THESE THOUGHTS OCCUPIED MY MIND AND I HAD A HUNCH THAT FATE WOULD SOON GIVE AWAY THE CAPTAIN'S SECRETS
839-130898-0077 THE NEXT DAY JUNE FIRST THE NAUTILUS KEPT TO THE SAME TACK IT WAS OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO LOCATE SOME PRECISE SPOT IN THE OCEAN JUST AS ON THE DAY BEFORE
839-130898-0078 CAPTAIN NEMO CAME TO TAKE THE ALTITUDE OF THE SUN THE SEA WAS SMOOTH THE SKIES CLEAR EIGHT MILES TO THE EAST A BIG STEAMSHIP WAS VISIBLE ON THE HORIZON LINE NO FLAG
839-130898-0079 WAS FLAPPING FROM THE GAFF OF ITS FORE AND AFT SAIL AND I COULDN'T TELL ITS NATIONALITY A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE SUN PASSED ITS ZENITH
839-130898-0080 AND TOOK HIS SIGHTS WITH THE UTMOST PRECISION THE ABSOLUTE CALM OF THE WAVES FACILITATED THIS OPERATION THE NAUTILUS LAY MOTIONLESS NEITHER ROLLING NOR PITCHING I WAS ON THE PLATFORM JUST THEN
839-130898-0081 AFTER DETERMINING OUR POSITION THE CAPTAIN PRONOUNCED ONLY THESE WORDS IT'S RIGHT HERE HE WENT DOWN THE HATCH HAD HE SEEN THAT VESSEL CHANGE COURSE
839-130898-0082 AND SEEMINGLY HEAD TOWARD US I'M UNABLE TO SAY I RETURNED TO THE LOUNGE THE HATCH CLOSED AND I HEARD WATER HISSING IN THE BALLAST TANKS THE NAUTILUS BEGAN TO SINK
839-130898-0083 ON A VERTICAL LINE BECAUSE ITS PROPELLER WAS IN CHECK AND NO LONGER FURNISHED ANY FORWARD MOTION SOME MINUTES LATER IT STOPPED AT A DEPTH OF EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY THREE METERS AND CAME TO REST ON THE SEAFLOOR
839-130898-0084 THE CEILING LIGHTS IN THE LOUNGE THEN WENT OUT THE PANELS OPENED AND THROUGH THE WINDOWS I SAW FOR A HALF MILE RADIUS THE SEA BRIGHTLY LIT BY THE BEACON'S RAYS
839-130898-0085 I LOOKED TO PORT AND SAW NOTHING BUT THE IMMENSENESS OF THESE TRANQUIL WATERS TO STARBOARD A PROMINENT BULGE ON THE SEA BOTTOM CAUGHT MY ATTENTION YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
839-130898-0086 IT WAS SOME RUIN ENSHROUDED IN A CRUST OF WHITENED SEASHELLS AS IF UNDER A MANTLE OF SNOW CAREFULLY EXAMINING THIS MASS I COULD IDENTIFY THE SWOLLEN OUTLINES OF A SHIP SHORN
839-130898-0087 OF ITS MASTS WHICH MUST HAVE SUNK BOW FIRST THIS CASUALTY CERTAINLY DATED FROM SOME FAR OFF TIME TO BE SO CAKED WITH THE LIMESTONE OF THESE WATERS
839-130898-0088 THIS WRECKAGE MUST HAVE SPENT MANY A YEAR ON THE OCEAN FLOOR WHAT SHIP WAS THIS WHY HAD THE NAUTILUS COME TO VISIT ITS GRAVE WAS IT SOMETHING OTHER THAN A MARITIME ACCIDENT THAT HAD DRAGGED THIS CRAFT UNDER THE WATERS
839-130898-0089 I WASN'T SURE WHAT TO THINK BUT NEXT TO ME I HEARD CAPTAIN NEMO'S VOICE SLOWLY SAY ORIGINALLY THIS SHIP WAS CHRISTENED
839-130898-0090 IT CARRIED SEVENTY FOUR CANNONS AND WAS LAUNCHED IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY TWO ON AUGUST THIRTEENTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT COMMANDED BY LA POYPE VERTRIEUX

839-130898-0099 NAILED UP ON THE AFTERDECK IT DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE WAVES TO SHOUTS OF LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC THIS IS THE AVENGER I EXCLAIMED YES SIR THE AVENGER A SPLENDID NAME
8580-287363-0000 RAPIDLY THE AIRSHIP ASCENDED AND WHEN IT WAS HIGH OVER THE TOWN OF SHOPTON TOM HEADED THE CRAFT DUE WEST LOOKING DOWN HE TRIED TO DESCRY MARY NESTOR IN HER CARRIAGE BUT THE TREES WERE IN THE WAY
8580-287363-0001 THEIR INTERLOCKING BRANCHES HIDING THE GIRL TOM DID SEE CROWDS OF OTHER PERSONS THOUGH THRONGING THE STREETS OF SHOPTON FOR THOUGH THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD MADE MANY FLIGHTS THERE WAS ALWAYS A NOVELTY ABOUT THEM THAT BROUGHT OUT THE CURIOUS
8580-287363-0002 COMPLIMENTED MISTER PARKER IS IT ALWAYS AS EASY AS THIS STARTING ALWAYS IS WAS THE ANSWER THOUGH AS THE IRISHMAN SAID COMING DOWN ISN'T SOMETIMES QUITE SO COMFORTABLE BLESS MY GIZZARD THAT'S SO
8580-287363-0003 CRIED THE ECCENTRIC MISTER DAMON CAN WE VOL PLANE TO EARTH IN THE RED CLOUD TOM YES BUT NOT AS EASILY AS IN THE BUTTERFLY HOWEVER I HOPE WE WILL NOT HAVE TO
8580-287363-0004 NOW MISTER DAMON IF YOU WILL JUST TAKE CHARGE OF THE STEERING APPARATUS FOR A MINUTE I WANT TO GO AFT WHAT FOR I WISH TO SEE IF EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY ERADICATE WAS MAKING THOSE QUEER MOTIONS
8580-287363-0005 MISTER DAMON WHO KNEW HOW TO OPERATE THE RED CLOUD WAS SOON GUIDING HER ON THE COURSE WHILE TOM MADE HIS WAY TO THE REAR COMPARTMENTS THROUGH THE MOTOR ROOM WHERE THE STORES OF SUPPLIES AND FOOD WERE KEPT HE MADE A CAREFUL EXAMINATION
8580-287363-0006 LOOKING FROM AN AFTER WINDOW AND EVEN GOING OUT ON A SMALL OPEN PLATFORM BUT COULD DISCOVER NOTHING WRONG I GUESS RAD WAS JUST CAPERING ABOUT WITHOUT ANY SPECIAL OBJECT MUSED TOM
8580-287363-0007 THAT THE COLORED MAN HAD HAD A METHOD IN HIS MADNESS ON HIS WAY BACK THROUGH THE MOTOR ROOM TOM LOOKED TO THE MACHINERY AND ADJUSTED SOME OF THE AUXILIARY OIL FEEDERS THE VARIOUS PIECES OF APPARATUS WERE WORKING WELL
8580-287363-0008 THOUGH THE ENGINE HAD NOT YET BEEN SPEEDED UP TO ITS LIMIT TOM WANTED IT TO WARM UP FIRST EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT ASKED MISTER DAMON AS TOM REJOINED THEM IN THE PILOT HOUSE WHICH WAS JUST FORWARD OF THE LIVING ROOM IN THE MAIN CABIN
8580-287363-0009 YES I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT MADE RAD ACT THAT WAY BUT I'LL SET THE AUTOMATIC STEERING GEAR NOW MISTER DAMON AND THEN YOU WILL BE RELIEVED MISTER JENKS WAS GAZING OFF TOWARD THE WEST
8580-287363-0010 TO WHERE HE HOPED TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF PHANTOM MOUNTAIN HOW DO YOU LIKE IT ASKED TOM IT'S GREAT REPLIED THE DIAMOND MAN I'VE NEVER BEEN IN AN AIRSHIP BEFORE AND IT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I EXPECTED BUT IT'S GREAT
8580-287363-0011 IT'S THE ONLY CRAFT THAT WILL SERVE OUR PURPOSE AMONG THE TOWERING MOUNTAIN PEAKS WHERE THE DIAMOND MAKERS ARE HIDDEN I HOPE WE CAN FIND THEM IN A LITTLE WHILE THE RED CLOUD WAS SKIMMING ALONG AT FASTER SPEED
8580-287363-0012 GUIDED BY THE AUTOMATIC RUDDERS SO THAT NO ONE WAS NEEDED IN THE PILOT HOUSE SINCE THERE WAS NO DANGER OF COLLISIONS AIRSHIPS ARE NOT QUITE NUMEROUS ENOUGH FOR THAT YET THOUGH THEY MAY SOON BECOME SO
8580-287363-0013 TOM AND THE OTHERS DEVOTED SEVERAL HOURS TO ARRANGING THEIR STATEROOMS AND BUNKS AND GETTING THEIR CLOTHING STOWED AWAY AND WHEN THIS WAS DONE MISTER PARKER AND MISTER JENKS SAT GAZING OFF INTO SPACE IT'S HARD TO REALIZE THAT WE ARE REALLY IN AN AIRSHIP
8580-287363-0014 OBSERVED THE DIAMOND MAN AT FIRST I THOUGHT I WOULD BE FRIGHTENED BUT I'M NOT A BIT IT DOESN'T SEEM AS IF ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN SOMETHING IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN SOON SAID MISTER PARKER SUDDENLY
8580-287363-0015 AS HE GAZED AT SOME WEATHER INSTRUMENTS ON THE CABIN WALL BLESS MY SOUL DON'T SAY THAT CRIED MISTER DAMON WHAT IS IT I THINK FROM MY OBSERVATIONS THAT WE WILL SOON HAVE A HURRICANE SAID THE SCIENTIFIC MAN
8580-287363-0016 THERE IS EVERY INDICATION OF IT AND HE SEEMED QUITE DELIGHTED AT THE PROSPECT OF HIS PREDICTION COMING TRUE A HURRICANE CRIED MISTER DAMON I HOPE IT ISN'T LIKE THE ONE THAT BLEW US TO EARTHQUAKE ISLAND
8580-287363-0017 OH I THINK THERE WILL BE NO DANGER SPOKE TOM IF IT COMES ON TO BLOW WE WILL ASCEND OR DESCEND OUT OF THE PATH OF THE STORM THIS CRAFT IS NOT LIKE THE ILL FATED WHIZZER I CAN MORE EASILY HANDLE THE RED CLOUD EVEN IN A BAD STORM
8580-287363-0018 REMARKED MISTER JENKS IT WOULD BE TOO BAD TO BE WRECKED BEFORE WE GOT TO PHANTOM MOUNTAIN WELL I PREDICT THAT WE WILL HAVE A BAD STORM INSISTED MISTER PARKER
8580-287363-0019 AND TOM COULD NOT HELP WISHING THAT THE SCIENTIST WOULD KEEP HIS GLOOMY FOREBODINGS TO HIMSELF HOWEVER THE STORM HAD NOT DEVELOPED UP TO NOON WHEN TOM WITH MISTER DAMON'S HELP SERVED A FINE MEAL IN THE DINING ROOM IN THE AFTERNOON THE SPEED OF THE SHIP WAS INCREASED
8580-287363-0020 AND BY NIGHT THEY HAD COVERED SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES THROUGH THE DARKNESS THE RED CLOUD KEPT ON MAKING GOOD TIME TOM GOT UP OCCASIONALLY TO LOOK TO THE MACHINERY
8580-287363-0021 AND AN ALARM BELL WOULD SOUND IN HIS STATEROOM WHEN ANYTHING WENT WRONG BLESS MY NAPKIN EXCLAIMED MISTER DAMON THE NEXT MORNING AS THEY SAT DOWN TO A BREAKFAST OF FRUIT HAM AND EGGS AND FRAGRANT COFFEE
8580-287363-0022 AND YET WE ARE HOW FAR ARE WE ABOVE THE EARTH TOM HE ASKED TURNING TO THE YOUNG INVENTOR ABOUT TWO MILES NOW I JUST SENT HER UP AS I THOUGHT I DETECTED THAT STORM MISTER PARKER SPOKE OF I TOLD YOU IT WOULD COME DECLARED THE SCIENTIST
8580-287363-0023 THAT MORNING BUT ONLY THE LOWER EDGE OF IT CAUGHT THE RED CLOUD AND WHEN TOM SENT HER UP STILL HIGHER SHE FOUND A COMPARATIVELY QUIET ZONE WHERE SHE SLID ALONG AT GOOD SPEED
8580-287363-0024 THAT AFTERNOON TOM BUSIED HIMSELF ABOUT SOME WIRES AND A NUMBER OF COMPLICATED PIECES OF APPARATUS WHICH WERE IN ONE CORNER OF THE MAIN CABIN WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW ASKED MISTER JENKS WHO HAD BEEN TALKING WITH MISTER PARKER
8580-287363-0025 AND SHOWING THAT SCIENTIST SOME OF THE MANUFACTURED DIAMONDS GETTING OUR WIRELESS APPARATUS IN SHAPE ANSWERED THE LAD I SHOULD HAVE DONE IT BEFORE BUT I HAD SO MUCH TO DO THAT I COULDN'T GET AT IT
8580-287363-0026 DAD WILL WANT TO KNOW HOW WE ARE DOING AS HE WORKED AWAY HE ALSO MADE UP HIS MIND TO SEND ANOTHER MESSAGE IN CARE OF HIS FATHER FOR THERE WAS A RECEIVING STATION IN THE SWIFT HOME AND TO WHOM THIS MESSAGE WAS ADDRESSED TOM DID NOT SAY
8580-287363-0027 BUT WE FANCY SOME OF OUR READERS CAN GUESS FINALLY AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF WORK THE WIRELESS WAS IN SHAPE TO SEND AND RECEIVE MESSAGES TOM PULLED OVER THE LEVER AND A CRACKLING SOUND WAS HEARD
8580-287363-0028 AS THE ELECTRICITY LEAPED FROM THE TRANSMITTERS INTO SPACE THEN HE CLAMPED THE RECEIVER ON HIS EAR ALL READY HE ANNOUNCED HAS ANYBODY ANY MESSAGES THEY WISH SENT FOR WITH THE COURTESY OF A TRUE HOST
8580-287363-0029 HE WAS READY TO SERVE HIS GUESTS BEFORE HE FORWARDED HIS OWN WIRELESS NOTES JUST TELL MY WIFE THAT I'M ENJOYING MYSELF REQUESTED MISTER DAMON BLESS MY FOOTSTOOL BUT THIS IS GREAT WE'RE OFF THE EARTH YET
8580-287363-0030 CONNECTED WITH IT MISTER JENKS HAD NO ONE TO WHOM HE WANTED TO SEND ANY WORD BUT MISTER PARKER WISH TO WIRE TO A FELLOW SCIENTIST THE RESULT OF SOME OBSERVATIONS MADE IN THE UPPER AIR TOM NOTED ALL THE MESSAGES DOWN
8580-287363-0031 AND THEN WHEN ALL WAS IN READINESS HE BEGAN TO CALL HIS HOME STATION HE KNEW THAT EITHER HIS FATHER OR MISTER JACKSON THE ENGINEER COULD RECEIVE THE WIRELESS
8580-287363-0032 BUT NO SOONER HAD THE YOUNG INVENTOR SENT OFF THE FIRST FEW DOTS AND DASHES REPRESENTING S I HIS HOME STATION CALL THAN HE STARTED AND A LOOK OF SURPRISE CAME OVER HIS FACE THEY'RE CALLING US HE EXCLAIMED WHO IS
8580-287363-0033 ASKED MISTER JENKS MY HOUSE MY FATHER HE HE'S BEEN TRYING TO GET US EVER SINCE WE STARTED BUT I DIDN'T HAVE THE WIRELESS IN SHAPE TO RECEIVE MESSAGES OH I HOPE IT'S NOT TOO LATE TOO LATE BLESS MY SOUL TOO LATE FOR WHAT
8580-287363-0034 GASPED MISTER DAMON SOMEWHAT ALARMED BY TOM'S MANNER THE LAD DID NOT ANSWER AT ONCE HE WAS INTENTLY LISTENING TO A SERIES OF DOTS AND DASHES THAT CLICKED IN THE TELEPHONE RECEIVER CLAMPED TO HIS LEFT EAR ON HIS FACE
8580-287363-0035 THERE WAS A LOOK OF WORRIMENT FATHER HAS JUST SENT ME A MESSAGE HE SAID IT'S A WARNING FLASHED THROUGH SPACE HE'S BEEN TRYING TO GET IT TO ME SINCE YESTERDAY
8580-287363-0036 ASKED MISTER JENKS RISING FROM HIS SEAT THE MYSTERIOUS MAN IS ABOARD THE AIRSHIP HIDDEN AWAY CRIED TOM THAT'S WHAT ERADICATE WAS TRYING TO CALL TO OUR ATTENTION AS WE STARTED OFF
8580-287364-0000 CHAPTER TEN DROPPING THE STOWAWAY TOM'S EXCITED ANNOUNCEMENT STARTLED MISTER DAMON AND THE OTHERS AS MUCH AS IF THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD INFORMED THEM THAT THE AIRSHIP HAD EXPLODED
8580-287364-0001 AND WAS ABOUT TO DASH WITH THEM TO THE EARTH THE MEN LEAPED TO THEIR FEET AND STARED AT THE LAD A STOWAWAY ON BOARD CRIED MISTER DAMON BLESS MY SOUL HOW DID HE ARE YOU SURE THAT MESSAGE IS STRAIGHT ASKED MISTER JENKS
8580-287364-0002 DID ERADICATE SEE THE MAN HE SAYS HE DID ANSWERED TOM THE MAN IS HIDDEN AWAY ON BOARD NOW PROBABLY AMONG THE STORES AND SUPPLIES BLESS MY TOMATO SAUCE EXPLODED MISTER DAMON
8580-287364-0003 WE MUST GET HIM OUT AT ONCE DECLARED MISTER JENKS I KNEW SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN ON THIS VOYAGE CAME FROM MISTER PARKER I PREDICTED IT FROM THE FIRST TOM THOUGHT CONSIDERABLE
8580-287364-0004 BUT HE DID NOT ANSWER THE SCIENTIST JUST THEN ANOTHER COMMUNICATION WAS COMING TO HIM BY WIRELESS HE LISTENED INTENTLY FATHER SAYS THE LAD TOLD HIS COMPANIONS THAT ERADICATE ONLY HAD A GLIMPSE OF THE MAN AT THE LAST MOMENT
8580-287364-0005 HE WAS LOOKING FROM THE REAR STOREROOM WINDOW HE'S THE SAME MAN WHO CALLED ON ME THAT TIME RAD REMEMBERS HIM VERY WELL BLESS MY SHOES WHAT'S TO BE DONE INQUIRED MISTER DAMON LOOKING AROUND HELPLESSLY
8580-287364-0006 DECIDED MISTER JENKS WITH VIGOR GET HIM OUT AND DROP HIM OVERBOARD DROP HIM OVERBOARD CRIED MISTER PARKER IN HORROR NOT EXACTLY BUT GET RID OF HIM
8580-287364-0007 THAT MAN IS ONE OF MY ENEMIES HE HAS BEEN SENT BY THE BAND OF DIAMOND MAKERS HIDDEN AMONG THE MOUNTAINS TO SPY ON ME AND IF POSSIBLE PREVENT ME FROM SEEKING TO DISCOVER THEIR SECRET
8580-287364-0008 HE TRIED TO WORK ON TOM'S SWIFT'S FEARS AND FRIGHTEN HIM FROM USING HIS AIRSHIP ON THIS QUEST THEN WHEN HE FAILED THE MAN MUST HAVE SNEAKED INTO THE SHED AND HIDDEN HIMSELF IN THE SHIP WE MUST GET RID OF HIM OR HE MAY WRECK THE RED CLOUD
8580-287364-0009 THAT'S SO CRIED TOM WE MUST TRY TO CAPTURE HIM I THINK WE HAD BETTER THE LAD PAUSED AND AGAIN LISTENED TO THE WIRELESS MESSAGE FATHER SAYS ERADICATE SAW THE MAN HAVE A GUN SO WE MUST BE CAREFUL
8580-287364-0010 THE YOUNG INVENTOR TRANSLATED THE DOTS AND DASHES BLESS MY POWDER HORN EXPLODED MISTER DAMON WE SHALL HAVE TO PROCEED CAUTIOUSLY THEN SPOKE MISTER JENKS
8580-287364-0011 IF HE IS LIKE ANY OTHERS IN THE GANG HE IS A DESPERATE MAN BETTER SNEAK UP ON HIM THEN IF WE CAN PROPOSED MISTER PARKER THERE ARE ENOUGH OF US TO COPE WITH ONE MAN EVEN IF HE IS ARMED
8580-287364-0012 HE INQUIRED OF TOM YES WAS THE HESITATING ANSWER BUT I DON'T WANT TO USE THEM IF I CAN HELP IT NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE DANGER AND A DISLIKE OF SHEDDING BLOOD BUT
8580-287364-0013 BECAUSE A STRAY BULLET MIGHT PIERCE THE GAS BAG AND DAMAGE THE SHIP THAT'S SO AGREED MISTER JENKS WELL I GUESS IF WE GO AT IT THE RIGHT WAY WE CAN CAPTURE HIM WITHOUT ANY SHOOTING BUT WE MUST TALK MORE QUIETLY
8580-287364-0014 HE MAY HAVE HEARD US I DON'T THINK SO REPLIED TOM THE STOREROOM IS FAR ENOUGH OFF SO THAT HE COULDN'T HEAR US BESIDES THE MOTOR MAKES SUCH A RACKET THAT HE COULDN'T DISTINGUISH WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EVEN IF HE HEARD OUR VOICES
8580-287364-0015 SO UNLESS HE HEARD THE WIRELESS WORKING AND SUSPECTS SOMETHING FROM THAT HE PROBABLY DOESN'T KNOW THAT WE ARE AWARE OF HIS PRESENCE ABOARD BUT WHY DO YOU THINK HE HAS REMAINED QUIET ALL THIS WHILE TOM ASKED MISTER DAMON
8580-287364-0016 PROBABLY HE WANTS TO WAIT UNTIL THE SHIP IS FARTHER OUT WEST SUGGESTED MISTER JENKS THEN HE WILL BE NEARER HIS FRIENDS AND CAN GET HELP IF HE NEEDS IT AND DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE HE WOULD DESTROY THE RED CLOUD ASKED MISTER PARKER
8580-287364-0017 I THINK THAT ALL HE IS WAITING FOR IS A FAVORABLE CHANCE DECLARED THE DIAMOND SEEKER HE WOULD DESTROY THE CRAFT AND US TOO IF HE COULD PREVENT US FROM DISCOVERING THE SECRET OF PHANTOM MOUNTAIN I BELIEVE
8580-287364-0018 THEN WE MUST GET AHEAD OF HIM DECIDED TOM QUIETLY I HAVE JUST FLASHED TO DAD A MESSAGE TELLING HIM THAT WE WILL HEED HIS WARNING NOW TO CAPTURE THE STOWAWAY
8580-287364-0019 AND WHILE WE'RE ABOUT IT GIVE HIM A GOOD SCARE WHEN WE DO GET HIM SUGGESTED MISTER JENKS HOW ASKED TOM THREATEN TO DROP HIM OVERBOARD PERHAPS THAT WILL MAKE HIM TELL HOW HE HAPPENED TO GET IN OUR SHIP
8580-287364-0020 AND WHAT ARE THE PLANS OF THE GANG OF DIAMOND MAKERS WE MAY GET VALUABLE INFORMATION THAT WAY I DON'T BELIEVE YOU CAN SCARE SUCH FELLOWS MUCH WAS TOM'S OPINION
8580-287364-0021 HOW ARE YOU GOING TO CAPTURE HIM ASKED MISTER PARKER IF HE HAS A GUN IT WON'T BE ANY TOO EASY TO GO IN THE STOREROOM AND DRAG HIM OUT WE'LL HAVE TO USE A LITTLE STRATEGY DECIDED TOM AND THEN THEY DISCUSSED SEVERAL PLANS
8580-287364-0022 THE ONE FINALLY ADOPTED WAS THAT TOM AND MISTER DAMON SHOULD ENTER THE STOREROOM CASUALLY AS IF IN SEARCH OF FOOD TO COOK FOR SUPPER THEY WOULD DISCUSS VARIOUS DISHES AND MISTER DAMON WAS TO EXPRESS A PREFERENCE FOR SOMETHING IN THE FOOD LINE
8580-287364-0023 THE BOX CONTAINING WHICH WAS WELL BACK IN THE ROOM THIS WOULD GIVE THE TWO A CHANCE TO PENETRATE TO THE FAR END OF THE APARTMENT WITHOUT AROUSING THE SUSPICIONS OF THE HIDDEN MAN WHO DOUBTLESS WOULD BE LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION AND AS SOON AS WE GET SIGHT OF HIM
8580-287364-0024 SAID TOM JUMP BEFORE HE HAS A CHANCE TO USE HIS GUN MISTER JENKS AND MISTER PARKER WILL BE WAITING OUTSIDE THE ROOM TO CATCH HIM IF HE GETS AWAY FROM US I'LL HAVE SOME ROPES READY AND WE'LL TIE HIM UP AND WELL WE'LL DECIDE LATER WHAT TO DO WITH HIM ALL RIGHT
8580-287364-0025 I'M READY AS SOON AS YOU ARE TOM SAID THE ECCENTRIC MAN COME AHEAD THEY WENT SOFTLY TO THE STOREROOM AND LISTENED AT THE DOOR THERE WAS NO SOUND HEARD SAVE THAT MADE BY THE MACHINERY I WONDER IF HE'S REALLY HERE
8580-287364-0026 WHISPERED MISTER DAMON WE'LL SOON FIND OUT ANSWERED TOM LET'S GO IN THEY ENTERED AND IN PURSUANCE OF THEIR PLAN TOM AND HIS FRIEND TALKED OF VARIOUS FOODS

8580-287364-0029 HE AND TOM MOVED CAUTIOUSLY BACK AMONG THE BOXES AND BARRELS THEY WERE GLANCING ABOUT WITH EAGER EYES TOM SWITCHED ON AN ELECTRIC LIGHT AND THE INSTANT HE DID SO
8580-287364-0030 HE WAS AWARE OF A MOVEMENT IN A LITTLE SPACE FORMED BY ONE BOX WHICH WAS PLACED ON TOP OF TWO OTHERS THE LAD SAW A DARK FIGURE MOVING AS IF TO GET FARTHER OUT OF SIGHT I'VE GOT HIM CRIED TOM MAKING A DIVE FOR THE SHADOW

8609-262281-0024 IT WILL BE ONLY RIGHT TO DO SO SUPPOSE WE ARE BOTH GOOD AND MERIT IT EQUALLY SUGGESTED FANNY
8609-262281-0025 YOU MUST NOT BE DISAPPOINTED IF IN THAT CASE I GIVE THE PRIVILEGE TO CAROLINE AS BEING THE ELDER OF THE TWO BUT I WILL MAKE IT UP TO YOU IN SOME OTHER WAY ALAS FOR POOR CAROLINE'S RESOLUTION FOR A SHORT TIME AN HOUR OR SO SHE DID STRIVE TO DO HER BEST
8609-262281-0026 BUT THEN GOOD RESOLUTIONS WERE FORGOTTEN AND IDLENESS FOLLOWED NOT ONLY IDLENESS TEMPER ALSO
8609-262281-0027 SHE EVEN FORGOT HERSELF SO FAR AS TO BE INSOLENT FANNY WAS TAKEN TO THE MEETING YOU SAW HER IN THE CARRIAGE WHEN LADY AUGUSTA DROVE TO MISTER GALLOWAY'S OFFICE AND PERSUADED HAMISH TO JOIN THEM CAROLINE WAS LEFT AT HOME IN A STATE OF OPEN REBELLION WITH THE LESSONS TO LEARN
8609-262281-0028 WHICH SHE HAD NOT LEARNT IN THE DAY HOW SHALL YOU GET ON WITH THEM CONSTANCE THE REV WILLIAM YORKE INQUIRED OF HER THAT SAME EVENING HAVE THE WEEDS DESTROYED THE GOOD SEED NOT QUITE DESTROYED IT REPLIED CONSTANCE THOUGH SHE SIGHED SADLY AS SHE SPOKE
8609-262281-0029 THERE IS SO MUCH ILL TO UNDO CAROLINE IS THE WORST THE WEEDS WITH HER HAVE HAD LONGER TIME TO GET AHEAD I THINK PERHAPS IF I COULD KEEP HER WHOLLY WITH ME FOR A TWELVEMONTH OR SO WATCHING OVER HER CONSTANTLY A GREAT DEAL MIGHT BE EFFECTED
8609-262281-0030 IF THAT ANTICIPATED LIVING WOULD FALL IN WHICH SEEMS VERY FAR AWAY IN THE CLOUDS AND YOU WERE WHOLLY MINE WE MIGHT HAVE CAROLINE WITH US FOR A TIME LAUGHED MISTER YORKE CONSTANCE LAUGHED TOO DO NOT BE IMPATIENT
8609-262281-0031 OR IT WILL SEEM TO BE FURTHER OFF STILL IT WILL COME WILLIAM THEY HAD BEEN SPEAKING IN AN UNDERTONE STANDING TOGETHER AT A WINDOW APART FROM THE REST MISTER CHANNING WAS LYING ON HIS SOFA UNDERNEATH THE OTHER WINDOW AND NOW SPOKE TO MISTER YORKE
8609-262281-0032 REPLIED MISTER CHANNING I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HIS EXPERIENCE IN ANOTHER LINE MAY BE OF SERVICE TO YOU CONTINUED MISTER YORKE
8609-262281-0033 I HAVE HEARD SO HIS COMPLAINT WAS RHEUMATISM VERY MUCH AS I FANCY THE SAME SORT OF RHEUMATISM THAT AFFLICTS YOU HE TOLD ME HE CAME TO EUROPE WITH VERY LITTLE HOPE HE FEARED HIS COMPLAINT HAD BECOME CHRONIC AND INCURABLE
8609-262281-0034 BUT HE HAS BEEN RESTORED IN A WONDERFUL MANNER AND IS IN SOUND HEALTH AGAIN AND WHAT REMEDIES DID HE USE EAGERLY ASKED MISTER CHANNING A THREE MONTHS RESIDENCE AT SOME MEDICINAL SPRINGS IN GERMANY NOTHING ELSE WHEN I SAY NOTHING ELSE OF COURSE I MUST IMPLY THAT HE WAS UNDER MEDICAL TREATMENT THERE
8609-262281-0035 IT IS THE VERY THING YOU SEE SIR THAT HAS BEEN ORDERED FOR YOU AY SIGHED MISTER CHANNING FEELING HOW VERY FAINT APPEARED TO BE THE HOPE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF TRYING IT I WAS MENTIONING YOUR CASE TO HIM OBSERVED MISTER YORKE
8609-262281-0036 THE CHANNINGS THEMSELVES WERE SILENT THEY COULD NOT SEE THE WAY AT ALL CLEAR WHEN MISTER YORKE WAS LEAVING HE BECKONED CONSTANCE AND ARTHUR INTO THE HALL
8609-262281-0037 THINK OF ALL THAT IS AT STAKE RENEWED HEALTH EXERTION HAPPINESS ARTHUR
8609-262281-0038 ARTHUR DID NOT FEEL HOPEFUL INDEED HIS HEART SANK WITHIN HIM THE WHOLE TIME THAT THEY WERE TALKING HAMISH AND HIS DIFFICULTIES WERE THE DARK SHADOW THOUGH HE COULD NOT TELL THIS TO MISTER YORKE WERE MISTER CHANNING TO GO ABROAD AND THE ARREST OF HAMISH TO FOLLOW UPON IT
8609-262281-0039 DOCTOR LAMB SAYS THE COST WAS SO TRIFLING AS SCARCELY TO BE CREDITED CONTINUED MISTER YORKE IN A TONE OF REMONSTRANCE ARTHUR DON'T YOU CARE TO HELP TO SAVE HIM I WOULD MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH TO SAVE MY FATHER IMPULSIVELY SPOKE ARTHUR
8609-262281-0040 STUNG BY THE IMPLIED REPROOF I SHOULD NOT CARE WHAT LABOUR IT COST ME TO PROCURE THE MONEY SO THAT I SUCCEEDED WE ALL WOULD SAID CONSTANCE YOU MUST KNOW WE WOULD WILLIAM FROM HAMISH DOWNWARDS
8609-262281-0041 DID YOU THINK I WAS LOST I WAS SEDUCED INTO JOINING YOUR MISSIONARY MEETING PEOPLE AND HAVE HAD TO STOP LATE AT THE OFFICE TO MAKE UP FOR IT
8609-262281-0042 FRESH HOPE SEEMS TO ARISE DAILY THAT THOSE GERMAN BATHS WOULD RESTORE HIM TO HEALTH THEY CURED DOCTOR LAMB I SAY HAMISH THAT THE MONEY MUST BE FOUND FOR IT SOMEHOW ADDED MISTER YORKE FOUND OF COURSE IT SHALL BE FOUND CRIED GAY HAMISH
8609-262281-0043 I INTEND TO BE A CHIEF CONTRIBUTOR TO IT MYSELF BUT HIS JOKING WORDS AND CARELESS MANNER JARRED AT THAT MOMENT UPON THE SPIRIT BOTH OF ARTHUR AND CONSTANCE CHANNING WHY
8609-283227-0000 HE AND ANOTHER FARMER HIS NEIGHBOUR HAD BEEN SO OFTEN RE ELECTED CHURCHWARDENS THAT AT LAST THEY SEEMED TO HAVE GAINED A PRESCRIPTIVE RIGHT TO THE OFFICE AND THE FORM OF ELECTION FELL INTO DISUSE
8609-283227-0001 BEEN SAID ABOUT THE ELECTION OF A COLLEAGUE SO LITTLE SEEMED TO FALL TO THE DUTY OF THE CHURCHWARDEN THAT I REGARDED THE NEGLECT AS A TRIFLE AND WAS REMISS IN SETTING IT RIGHT I HAD THEREFORE TO SUFFER AS WAS JUST INDEED MISTER BROWNRIGG WAS NOT THE MAN TO HAVE POWER IN HIS HANDS UNCHECKED
8609-283227-0002 I HAD SO FAR RECOVERED THAT I WAS ABLE TO RISE ABOUT NOON AND GO INTO MY STUDY THOUGH I WAS VERY WEAK AND HAD NOT YET BEEN OUT WHEN ONE MORNING MISSUS PEARSON CAME INTO THE ROOM AND SAID PLEASE SIR
8609-283227-0003 CONFIDENT THERE MUST BE A GOOD REASON FOR IT AND SO TOLD MISSUS PEARSON TO SHOW HIM IN OH SIR I KNOW YOU WOULD BE VEXED IF YOU HADN'T BEEN TOLD HE EXCLAIMED AND I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT BE ANGRY WITH ME FOR TROUBLING YOU WHAT IS THE MATTER TOM I SAID
8609-283227-0004 WHICH WERE NECESSARY AND MUST BE DONE BEFORE ANOTHER WINTER I CONFESS I WAS RATHER PLEASED FOR I WANTED MY PEOPLE TO FEEL THAT THE CHURCH WAS THEIR PROPERTY AND THAT IT WAS THEIR PRIVILEGE IF THEY COULD REGARD IT AS A BLESSING TO HAVE THE CHURCH TO KEEP IT IN DECENT ORDER AND REPAIR
8609-283227-0005 TO MY CHURCHWARDEN WE MUST CALL A VESTRY BEFORE LONG AND HAVE THIS LOOKED TO NOW MY PREDECESSOR HAD LEFT EVERYTHING OF THE KIND TO HIS CHURCHWARDENS AND THE INHABITANTS FROM THEIR SIDE HAD LIKEWISE LEFT THE WHOLE AFFAIR TO THE CHURCHWARDENS BUT MISTER BROWNRIGG
8609-283227-0006 WHO I MUST SAY HAD TAKEN MORE PAINS THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED OF HIM TO MAKE HIMSELF ACQUAINTED WITH THE LEGALITIES OF HIS OFFICE DID NOT FAIL TO CALL A VESTRY TO WHICH AS USUAL NO ONE HAD RESPONDED WHEREUPON HE IMPOSED A RATE ACCORDING TO HIS OWN UNAIDED JUDGMENT THIS I BELIEVE
8609-283227-0007 HE DID DURING MY ILLNESS WITH THE NOTION OF PLEASING ME BY THE DISCOVERY THAT THE REPAIRS HAD BEEN ALREADY EFFECTED ACCORDING TO MY MIND NOR DID ANY ONE OF MY CONGREGATION THROW THE LEAST DIFFICULTY IN THE CHURCHWARDEN'S WAY AND NOW I MUST REFER TO ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE HISTORY OF MY PARISH
8609-283227-0008 THERE WAS A LITTLE CHAPEL DOWN A LANE LEADING FROM THE MAIN STREET OF THE VILLAGE IN WHICH THERE WAS SERVICE THREE TIMES EVERY SUNDAY
8609-283227-0009 AMONGST WHOM WERE THE FAMILIES OF TWO OR THREE FARMERS OF SUBSTANCE WHILE THE VILLAGE AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD CONTRIBUTED A PORTION OF THE POOREST OF THE INHABITANTS A YEAR OR TWO BEFORE I CAME THEIR MINISTER DIED AND THEY HAD CHOSEN ANOTHER A VERY WORTHY MAN OF CONSIDERABLE ERUDITION
8609-283227-0010 BUT OF EXTREME VIEWS AS I HEARD UPON INSIGNIFICANT POINTS AND MOVED BY A GREAT DISLIKE TO NATIONAL CHURCHES AND EPISCOPACY THIS I SAY IS WHAT I HAD MADE OUT ABOUT HIM FROM WHAT I HAD HEARD
8609-283227-0011 AND MY READER WILL VERY PROBABLY BE INCLINED TO ASK BUT WHY WITH PRINCIPLES SUCH AS YOURS SHOULD YOU HAVE ONLY HEARSAY TO GO UPON WHY DID YOU NOT MAKE THE HONEST MAN'S ACQUAINTANCE IN SUCH A SMALL PLACE MEN SHOULD NOT KEEP EACH OTHER AT ARM'S LENGTH
8609-283227-0012 AND ANY READER WHO SAYS SO WILL SAY RIGHT ALL I HAVE TO SUGGEST FOR MYSELF IS SIMPLY A CERTAIN SHYNESS FOR WHICH I CANNOT ENTIRELY ACCOUNT BUT WHICH WAS PARTLY MADE UP OF FEAR TO INTRUDE OR OF BEING SUPPOSED TO ARROGATE TO MYSELF THE RIGHT OF MAKING ADVANCES
8609-283227-0013 PARTLY OF A DREAD LEST WE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET ON TOGETHER AND SO THE ATTEMPT SHOULD RESULT IN SOMETHING UNPLEASANTLY AWKWARD I DARESAY LIKEWISE THAT THE NATURAL SHELLINESS OF THE ENGLISH HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT AT ALL EVENTS I HAD NOT MADE HIS ACQUAINTANCE
8609-283227-0014 MISTER TEMPLETON THEN HAD REFUSED AS A POINT OF CONSCIENCE TO PAY THE CHURCH RATE WHEN THE COLLECTOR WENT ROUND TO DEMAND IT HAD BEEN SUMMONED BEFORE A MAGISTRATE IN CONSEQUENCE HAD SUFFERED A DEFAULT AND PROCEEDINGS BEING PUSHED FROM THE FIRST IN ALL THE PRIDE OF MISTER BROWNRIGG'S LEGALITY
8609-283227-0015 HAD ON THIS VERY DAY BEEN VISITED BY THE CHURCHWARDEN ACCOMPANIED BY A BROKER FROM THE NEIGHBOURING TOWN OF ADDICEHEAD AND AT THE VERY TIME WHEN I WAS HEARING OF THE FACT WAS SUFFERING DISTRAINT OF HIS GOODS THE PORCINE HEAD OF THE CHURCHWARDEN WAS NOT ON HIS SHOULDERS BY ACCIDENT NOR WITHOUT SIGNIFICANCE
8609-283227-0016 BUT I DID NOT WAIT TO UNDERSTAND ALL THIS NOW IT WAS ENOUGH FOR ME THAT TOM BORE WITNESS TO THE FACT THAT AT THAT MOMENT PROCEEDINGS WERE THUS DRIVEN TO EXTREMITY I RANG THE BELL FOR MY BOOTS AND TO THE OPEN MOUTHED DISMAY OF MISSUS PEARSON LEFT THE VICARAGE LEANING ON TOM'S ARM
8609-283227-0017 BUT SUCH WAS THE COMMOTION IN MY MIND THAT I HAD BECOME QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF ILLNESS OR EVEN FEEBLENESS HURRYING ON IN MORE TERROR THAN I CAN WELL EXPRESS LEST I SHOULD BE TOO LATE I REACHED MISTER TEMPLETON'S HOUSE JUST AS A SMALL MAHOGANY TABLE WAS BEING HOISTED INTO A SPRING CART
8609-283227-0018 WHICH STOOD AT THE DOOR BREATHLESS WITH HASTE I WAS YET ABLE TO CALL OUT PUT THAT TABLE DOWN DIRECTLY AT THE SAME MOMENT MISTER BROWNRIGG APPEARED FROM WITHIN THE DOOR
8609-283227-0019 I THINK HE HAD NOT HEARD ME YOU SEE I'M PROMPT MISTER WALTON HE SAID BUT BLESS MY SOUL HOW ILL YOU LOOK WITHOUT ANSWERING HIM FOR I WAS MORE ANGRY WITH HIM THAN I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN I REPEATED PUT THAT TABLE DOWN I TELL YOU THEY DID SO
8609-283227-0020 NOW I SAID CARRY IT BACK INTO THE HOUSE WHY SIR INTERPOSED MISTER BROWNRIGG IT'S ALL RIGHT YES I SAID AS RIGHT AS THE DEVIL WOULD HAVE IT
8609-283227-0021 I'M NOT SO SURE OF THAT I BELIEVE I HAD THE RIGHT TO BE CHAIRMAN AT THE VESTRY MEETING BUT INSTEAD OF EVEN LETTING ME KNOW YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF MY ILLNESS TO HURRY ON MATTERS TO THIS SHAMEFUL AND WICKED EXCESS I DID THE POOR MAN WRONG IN THIS FOR I BELIEVE HE HAD HURRIED THINGS REALLY TO PLEASE ME
8609-283227-0022 HIS FACE HAD LENGTHENED CONSIDERABLY BY THIS TIME AND ITS RUBICUND HUE DECLINED I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD STAND UPON CEREMONY ABOUT IT SIR
8609-283227-0023 BEFORE SUCH A THING SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED I FEEL SO DISGRACED I AM ASHAMED TO LOOK MISTER TEMPLETON IN THE FACE CARRY THAT TABLE INTO THE HOUSE AGAIN DIRECTLY IT'S MY PROPERTY NOW INTERPOSED THE BROKER I'VE BOUGHT IT OF THE CHURCHWARDEN AND PAID FOR IT
8609-283227-0024 BUT I TELL YOU THE WHOLE AFFAIR IS ILLEGAL AND IF YOU CARRY AWAY THAT TABLE I SHALL SEE WHAT THE LAW WILL DO FOR ME I ASSURE YOU I WILL PROSECUTE YOU MYSELF YOU TAKE UP THAT MONEY OR I WILL IT WILL GO TO PAY COUNSEL I GIVE YOU MY WORD IF YOU DO NOT TAKE IT TO QUENCH STRIFE
8609-283227-0025 I STRETCHED OUT MY HAND BUT THE BROKER WAS BEFORE ME WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD HE POCKETED THE MONEY JUMPED INTO HIS CART WITH HIS MAN AND DROVE OFF LEAVING THE CHURCHWARDEN AND THE PARSON STANDING AT THE DOOR OF THE DISSENTING MINISTER WITH HIS MAHOGANY TABLE ON THE PATH BETWEEN THEM NOW MISTER BROWNRIGG I SAID
8609-283227-0026 LEND ME A HAND TO CARRY THIS TABLE IN AGAIN HE YIELDED NOT GRACIOUSLY THAT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED BUT IN SILENCE OH SIR INTERPOSED YOUNG TOM WHO HAD STOOD BY DURING THE DISPUTE LET ME TAKE IT YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO LIFT IT
8609-283227-0027 AND SO MISTER BROWNRIGG AND I BLUNDERED INTO THE LITTLE PARLOUR WITH OUR BURDEN NOT A GREAT ONE
8609-283227-0028 MISTER TEMPLETON SAT IN A WINDSOR CHAIR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM EVIDENTLY THE TABLE HAD BEEN CARRIED AWAY FROM BEFORE HIM LEAVING HIS POSITION UNCOVERED THE FLOOR WAS STREWED WITH THE BOOKS WHICH HAD LAIN UPON IT HE SAT READING AN OLD FOLIO AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED
8609-283227-0029 BUT WHEN WE ENTERED HE ROSE HE WAS A MAN OF MIDDLE SIZE ABOUT FORTY WITH SHORT BLACK HAIR AND OVERHANGING BUSHY EYEBROWS HIS MOUTH INDICATED GREAT FIRMNESS NOT UNMINGLED WITH SWEETNESS AND EVEN WITH HUMOUR HE SMILED AS HE ROSE BUT LOOKED EMBARRASSED
8609-283227-0030 GLANCING FIRST AT THE TABLE THEN AT ME AND THEN AT MISTER BROWNRIGG AS IF BEGGING SOMEBODY TO TELL HIM WHAT TO SAY BUT I DID NOT LEAVE HIM A MOMENT IN THIS PERPLEXITY MISTER TEMPLETON I SAID QUITTING THE TABLE AND HOLDING OUT MY HAND
8609-283227-0031 THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN ANNOYED LIKE THIS I HAVE MISTER TEMPLETON INTERRUPTED ME I ASSURE YOU IT WAS A MATTER OF CONSCIENCE WITH ME HE SAID ON NO OTHER GROUND I KNOW IT I KNOW IT I SAID INTERRUPTING HIM IN MY TURN
8609-283227-0032 I BEG YOUR PARDON AND I HAVE DONE MY BEST TO MAKE AMENDS FOR IT OFFENCES MUST COME YOU KNOW MISTER TEMPLETON BUT I TRUST I HAVE NOT INCURRED THE WOE THAT FOLLOWS UPON THEM BY MEANS OF WHOM THEY COME FOR I KNEW NOTHING OF IT AND INDEED WAS TOO ILL
8609-283227-0033 MISTER BROWNRIGG I SPOKE IN HEAT WHEN I CAME UP TO YOU AND I AM SURE I DID YOU WRONG I AM CERTAIN YOU HAD NO IMPROPER MOTIVE IN NOT MAKING ME ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR PROCEEDINGS YOU MEANT NO HARM TO ME BUT YOU DID VERY WRONG TOWARDS MISTER TEMPLETON I WILL TRY TO SHOW YOU THAT WHEN I AM WELL AGAIN
8609-283227-0034 BUT BUT YOU MUSTN'T TALK MORE NOW SAID DOCTOR DUNCAN SO I SHOOK HANDS WITH MISTER BROWNRIGG AND WE PARTED I FEAR FROM WHAT I KNOW OF MY CHURCHWARDEN THAT HE WENT HOME WITH THE CONVICTION THAT HE HAD DONE PERFECTLY RIGHT
8609-283227-0035 AND AMONGST THEM BY MISTER TEMPLETON AND HERE I MAY AS WELL SKETCH THE RESULT OF THAT STRANGE INTRODUCTION TO THE DISSENTING MINISTER
8609-283227-0036 THE GIST OF THE LETTER LAY IN THESE WORDS I CONFESS IT PERPLEXES ME TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO RECONCILE YOUR CHRISTIAN AND FRIENDLY BEHAVIOUR TO ONE WHOM MOST OF YOUR BRETHREN WOULD CONSIDER AS MUCH BENEATH THEIR NOTICE AS INFERIOR TO THEM IN SOCIAL POSITION
8609-283227-0037 WITH YOUR REMAINING THE MINISTER OF A CHURCH IN WHICH SUCH ENORMITIES AS YOU EMPLOYED YOUR PRIVATE INFLUENCE TO COUNTERACT IN MY CASE ARE NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT CERTAINLY LAWFUL AND RECOGNIZED BY MOST OF ITS MEMBERS AS LIKEWISE EXPEDIENT TO THIS I REPLIED
8609-283227-0038 MY DEAR SIR I DO NOT LIKE WRITING LETTERS ESPECIALLY ON SUBJECTS OF IMPORTANCE THERE ARE A THOUSAND CHANCES OF MISUNDERSTANDING WHEREAS IN A PERSONAL INTERVIEW THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF CONTROVERSY BEING HALLOWED BY COMMUNION
8609-283227-0039 TO MISSUS TEMPLETON FOR NOT INVITING HER WITH YOU
8609-283227-0040 HOW YOU COULD BELONG TO A CHURCH WHICH AUTHORIZES THINGS OF WHICH YOU YOURSELF SO HEARTILY DISAPPROVE AND I ANSWER YOU I RETURNED THAT JUST TO SUCH A CHURCH OUR LORD BELONGED I DO NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND YOU OUR LORD BELONGED TO THE JEWISH CHURCH
8609-283227-0041 I WANT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SHOW YOU THE PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH HE ACTED WITH REGARD TO CHURCH RATES CERTAINLY I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR INTERRUPTING YOU THE PHARISEES DEMANDED A TRIBUTE WHICH IT IS ALLOWED WAS FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE TEMPLE AND ITS WORSHIP
8609-283227-0042 OUR LORD DID NOT REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR AUTHORITY NOTWITHSTANDING THE MANY WAYS IN WHICH THEY HAD DEGRADED THE RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES OF THE JEWISH CHURCH HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIMSELF A CHILD OF THE CHURCH BUT SAID THAT AS A CHILD HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN LEFT TO CONTRIBUTE AS HE PLEASED
8609-283227-0043 TO THE SUPPORT OF ITS ORDINANCES AND NOT TO BE COMPELLED AFTER SUCH A FASHION THERE I HAVE YOU EXCLAIMED MISTER TEMPLETON
8609-283227-0044 I GRANT IT IT IS ENTIRELY WRONG A VERY UNCHRISTIAN PROCEEDING BUT OUR LORD DID NOT THEREFORE DESERT THE CHURCH AS YOU WOULD HAVE ME DO HE PAID THE MONEY LEST HE SHOULD OFFEND AND NOT HAVING IT OF HIS OWN HE HAD TO ASK HIS FATHER FOR IT
8609-283227-0045 OR WHAT CAME TO THE SAME THING MAKE A SERVANT OF HIS FATHER NAMELY A FISH IN THE SEA OF GALILEE
8609-283227-0046 IT IS WRONG TO COMPEL AND WRONG TO REFUSE THE PAYMENT OF A CHURCH RATE I DO NOT SAY EQUALLY WRONG IT IS MUCH WORSE TO COMPEL THAN TO REFUSE YOU ARE VERY GENEROUS RETURNED MISTER TEMPLETON
8609-283227-0047 MAY I HOPE THAT YOU WILL DO ME THE CREDIT TO BELIEVE THAT IF I SAW CLEARLY THAT THEY WERE THE SAME THING I WOULD NOT HESITATE A MOMENT TO FOLLOW OUR LORD'S EXAMPLE I BELIEVE IT PERFECTLY THEREFORE HOWEVER WE MAY DIFFER WE ARE IN REALITY AT NO STRIFE
8609-283227-0048 BUT IS THERE NOT THIS DIFFERENCE THAT OUR LORD WAS AS YOU SAY A CHILD OF THE JEWISH CHURCH WHICH WAS INDUBITABLY ESTABLISHED BY GOD NOW IF I CANNOT CONSCIENTIOUSLY BELONG TO THE SO CALLED ENGLISH CHURCH WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY CHURCH RATE OR TRIBUTE
8609-283227-0049 SHALL I TELL YOU THE ARGUMENT THE ENGLISH CHURCH MIGHT THEN USE THE CHURCH MIGHT SAY THEN YOU ARE A STRANGER AND NO CHILD THEREFORE LIKE THE KINGS OF THE EARTH WE MAY TAKE TRIBUTE OF YOU SO YOU SEE IT WOULD COME TO THIS THAT DISSENTERS ALONE SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO PAY CHURCH RATES
8609-283227-0050 WE BOTH LAUGHED AT THIS PUSHING OF THE ARGUMENT TO ILLEGITIMATE CONCLUSIONS THEN I RESUMED BUT THE REAL ARGUMENT IS THAT NOT FOR SUCH FAULTS SHOULD WE SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER NOT FOR SUCH FAULTS OR ANY FAULTS SO LONG AS IT IS THE REPOSITORY OF THE TRUTH SHOULD YOU SEPARATE FROM THE CHURCH
