8226-274371-0015 WHILE HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FORMER ERROR OF EMPLOYING A PLEA OF NECESSITY IN ORDER TO INFRINGE THE LAWS AND CONSTITUTION WARNED THE PARLIAMENT NOT TO IMITATE AN EXAMPLE ON WHICH THEY THREW SUCH VIOLENT BLAME AND THE PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0016 WHILE THEY CLOTHED THEIR PERSONAL FEARS OR AMBITION UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF NATIONAL AND IMMINENT DANGER MADE UNKNOWINGLY AN APOLOGY FOR THE MOST EXCEPTIONABLE PART OF THE KING'S CONDUCT
8226-274371-0017 THAT THE LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE WERE NO LONGER EXPOSED TO ANY PERIL FROM ROYAL AUTHORITY SO NARROWLY CIRCUMSCRIBED SO EXACTLY DEFINED
8226-274371-0018 MIGHT BE MAINTAINED UPON VERY PLAUSIBLE TOPICS BUT THAT THE DANGER ALLOWING IT TO HAVE ANY EXISTENCE WAS NOT OF THAT KIND GREAT URGENT INEVITABLE WHICH DISSOLVES ALL LAW AND LEVELS ALL LIMITATIONS
8226-274371-0019 WERE UNDOUBTEDLY NOT OF A CIVIL BUT OF A RELIGIOUS NATURE THE DISTEMPERED IMAGINATIONS OF MEN WERE AGITATED WITH A CONTINUAL DREAD OF POPERY WITH A HORROR AGAINST PRELACY WITH AN ANTIPATHY TO CEREMONIES AND THE LITURGY
8226-274371-0020 AND MORE ACTUATED BY PRINCIPLE
8226-274371-0021 NEVER WERE THERE INDIVIDUALS WHO POSSESSED MORE CAPACITY MORE COURAGE MORE PUBLIC SPIRIT MORE DISINTERESTED ZEAL THE INFUSION OF ONE INGREDIENT IN TOO LARGE A PROPORTION HAD CORRUPTED ALL THESE NOBLE PRINCIPLES
8226-274371-0022 AND CONVERTED THEM INTO THE MOST VIRULENT POISON TO DETERMINE HIS CHOICE IN THE APPROACHING CONTESTS EVERY MAN HEARKENED WITH AVIDITY TO THE REASONS PROPOSED ON BOTH SIDES THE WAR OF THE PEN PRECEDED THAT OF THE SWORD
8226-274371-0023 LORD FALKLAND HAD ACCEPTED THE OFFICE OF SECRETARY A MAN WHO ADORNED THE PUREST VIRTUE WITH THE RICHEST GIFTS OF NATURE AND THE MOST VALUABLE ACQUISITIONS OF LEARNING BY HIM ASSISTED BY THE KING HIMSELF
8226-274371-0024 WERE THE MEMORIALS OF THE ROYAL PARTY CHIEFLY COMPOSED SO SENSIBLE WAS CHARLES OF HIS SUPERIORITY IN THIS PARTICULAR THAT HE TOOK CARE TO DISPERSE EVERY WHERE THE PAPERS OF THE PARLIAMENT TOGETHER WITH HIS OWN
8226-274371-0025 BY COMPARISON TO FORM A JUDGMENT BETWEEN THEM THE PARLIAMENT WHILE THEY DISTRIBUTED COPIES OF THEIR OWN WERE ANXIOUS TO SUPPRESS ALL THE KING'S COMPOSITIONS
8226-274371-0026 TO THE ORDINANCE OF THE PARLIAMENT CONCERNING THE MILITIA THE KING OPPOSED HIS COMMISSIONS OF ARRAY THE COUNTIES OBEYED THE ONE OR THE OTHER ACCORDING AS THEY STOOD AFFECTED AND IN MANY COUNTIES WHERE THE PEOPLE WERE DIVIDED
8226-274371-0027 MOBBISH COMBATS AND SKIRMISHES ENSUED THE PARLIAMENT ON THIS OCCASION WENT SO FAR AS TO VOTE THAT WHEN THE LORDS AND COMMONS IN PARLIAMENT WHICH IS THE SUPREME COURT OF JUDICATURE
8226-274371-0028 UPON THE SAME PRINCIPLES THEY PRETENDED BY A VERBAL CRITICISM ON THE TENSE OF A LATIN VERB TO RAVISH FROM THE KING HIS NEGATIVE VOICE IN THE LEGISLATURE
8226-274371-0029 WOULD ADMIT HIM WITH HIS RETINUE AFTER WHICH HE MIGHT EASILY RENDER HIMSELF MASTER OF THE PLACE BUT THE GOVERNOR WAS ON HIS GUARD HE SHUT THE GATES AND REFUSED TO RECEIVE THE KING
8226-274371-0030 WHO DESIRED LEAVE TO ENTER WITH TWENTY PERSONS ONLY CHARLES IMMEDIATELY PROCLAIMED HIM TRAITOR
8226-274371-0031 THOUGH THEY HAD ALREADY LEVIED A GUARD FOR THEMSELVES HAD ATTEMPTED TO SEIZE ALL THE MILITARY POWER ALL THE NAVY AND ALL THE FORTS OF THE KINGDOM AND HAD OPENLY EMPLOYED THEIR AUTHORITY IN EVERY KIND OF WARLIKE PREPARATIONS YET IMMEDIATELY VOTED
8226-274371-0032 THAT THE KING SEDUCED BY WICKED COUNSEL INTENDED TO MAKE WAR AGAINST HIS PARLIAMENT WHO IN ALL THEIR CONSULTATIONS AND ACTIONS HAD PROPOSED NO OTHER END BUT THE CARE OF HIS KINGDOMS
8226-274371-0033 WERE TRAITORS TO THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF THE KINGDOM THE ARMIES WHICH HAD BEEN EVERYWHERE RAISED ON PRETENCE OF THE SERVICE IN IRELAND WERE HENCEFORTH MORE OPENLY ENLISTED BY THE PARLIAMENT FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES
8226-274371-0034 AND THE COMMAND OF THEM WAS GIVEN TO THE EARL OF ESSEX IN LONDON NO LESS THAN FOUR THOUSAND MEN ENLISTED IN ONE DAY AND THE PARLIAMENT VOTED A DECLARATION WHICH THEY REQUIRED EVERY MEMBER TO SUBSCRIBE
8226-274371-0035 THEY ISSUED ORDERS FOR BRINGING IN LOANS OF MONEY AND PLATE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN FORCES WHICH SHOULD DEFEND THE KING AND BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT FOR THIS STYLE THEY STILL PRESERVED WITHIN TEN DAYS
8226-274371-0036 AND WAIT TILL THE TREASURERS COULD FIND LEISURE TO RECEIVE THEM SUCH ZEAL ANIMATED THE PIOUS PARTISANS OF THE PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0037 NEAR THE MOIETY TOO OF THE LOWER HOUSE ABSENTED THEMSELVES FROM COUNSELS WHICH THEY DEEMED SO FULL OF DANGER THE COMMONS SENT UP AN IMPEACHMENT AGAINST NINE PEERS FOR DESERTING THEIR DUTY IN PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0038 THEIR OWN MEMBERS ALSO WHO SHOULD RETURN TO THEM THEY VOTED NOT TO ADMIT TILL SATISFIED CONCERNING THE REASON OF THEIR ABSENCE CHARLES MADE A DECLARATION TO THE PEERS WHO ATTENDED HIM
8226-274371-0039 THAT HE EXPECTED FROM THEM NO OBEDIENCE TO ANY COMMANDS WHICH WERE NOT WARRANTED BY THE LAWS OF THE LAND THE PEERS ANSWERED THIS DECLARATION BY A PROTEST
8226-274371-0040 IN ORDER TO REMOVE ALL JEALOUSY HE HAD RESOLVED THAT THEIR USURPATIONS AND ILLEGAL PRETENSIONS SHOULD BE APPARENT TO THE WHOLE WORLD AND THOUGHT THAT TO RECOVER THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE WAS A POINT MUCH MORE MATERIAL TO HIS INTEREST
8226-274371-0041 THAN THE COLLECTING OF ANY MAGAZINES STORES OR ARMIES WHICH MIGHT BREED APPREHENSIONS OF VIOLENT OR ILLEGAL COUNSELS BUT THE URGENT NECESSITY OF HIS SITUATION NO LONGER ADMITTED OF DELAY
8226-274371-0042 HE NOW PREPARED HIMSELF FOR DEFENCE WITH A SPIRIT ACTIVITY AND ADDRESS
8226-274371-0043 HE EMPLOYED ALL THE ADVANTAGES WHICH REMAINED TO HIM AND ROUSED UP HIS ADHERENTS TO ARMS THE RESOURCES OF THIS PRINCE'S GENIUS INCREASED IN PROPORTION TO HIS DIFFICULTIES
8226-274371-0044 AND HE NEVER APPEARED GREATER THAN WHEN PLUNGED INTO THE DEEPEST PERILS AND DISTRESSES FROM THE MIXED CHARACTER INDEED OF CHARLES AROSE IN PART THE MISFORTUNES IN WHICH ENGLAND WAS AT THIS TIME INVOLVED
8226-274371-0045 THAT THE KING MIGHT DESPAIR OF ALL COMPOSITION
8226-274371-0046 THEIR DEMANDS CONTAINED IN NINETEEN PROPOSITIONS AMOUNTED TO A TOTAL ABOLITION OF MONARCHICAL AUTHORITY THEY REQUIRED THAT NO MAN SHOULD REMAIN IN THE COUNCIL WHO WAS NOT AGREEABLE TO PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0047 THAT NONE OF THE ROYAL FAMILY SHOULD MARRY WITHOUT CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT OR COUNCIL
8226-274371-0048 THAT THE VOTES OF POPISH LORDS SHOULD BE EXCLUDED THAT THE REFORMATION OF THE LITURGY AND CHURCH GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE PLACE ACCORDING TO ADVICE OF PARLIAMENT THAT THE ORDINANCE WITH REGARD TO THE MILITIA BE SUBMITTED TO
8226-274371-0049 THAT THE JUSTICE OF PARLIAMENT PASS UPON ALL DELINQUENTS THAT A GENERAL PARDON BE GRANTED WITH SUCH EXCEPTIONS AS SHOULD BE ADVISED BY PARLIAMENT THAT THE FORTS AND CASTLES BE DISPOSED OF BY CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0050 AND THAT NO PEER BE MADE BUT WITH CONSENT OF BOTH HOUSES SHOULD I GRANT THESE DEMANDS SAID THE KING IN REPLY I MAY BE WAITED ON BAREHEADED I MAY HAVE MY HAND KISSED
8226-274371-0051 THE TITLE OF MAJESTY MAY BE CONTINUED TO ME AND THE KING'S AUTHORITY SIGNIFIED BY BOTH HOUSES MAY STILL BE THE STYLE OF YOUR COMMANDS I MAY HAVE SWORDS AND MACES CARRIED BEFORE ME
8226-274371-0052 BUT THE PICTURE BUT THE SIGN OF A KING WAR ON ANY TERMS WAS ESTEEMED BY THE KING AND ALL THE COUNSELLORS PREFERABLE TO SO IGNOMINIOUS A PEACE
8226-274371-0053 AND THE HEARTS OF HIS LOYAL SUBJECTS WHICH WITH GOD'S BLESSING HE DOUBTED NOT WOULD RECOVER ALL THE REST COLLECTING THEREFORE SOME FORCES HE ADVANCED SOUTHWARDS
8238-274553-0000 I'LL HAVE NONE O THEM NED KNOWLES THE BARON RITZNER VON JUNG WAS A NOBLE HUNGARIAN FAMILY EVERY MEMBER OF WHICH AT LEAST AS FAR BACK INTO ANTIQUITY AS ANY CERTAIN RECORDS EXTEND
8238-274553-0001 WAS MORE OR LESS REMARKABLE FOR TALENT OF SOME DESCRIPTION THE MAJORITY FOR THAT SPECIES OF GROTESQUERIE IN CONCEPTION OF WHICH TIECK A SCION OF THE HOUSE HAS GIVEN A VIVID
8238-274553-0002 THREW A PLACE IN HIS REGARD AND HERE WITH SOMEWHAT MORE DIFFICULTY A PARTIAL INSIGHT INTO HIS MENTAL CONFORMATION IN LATER DAYS THIS INSIGHT GREW MORE CLEAR
8238-274553-0003 WHICH HIS ADVENT EXCITED WITHIN THE COLLEGE PRECINCTS ON THE NIGHT OF THE TWENTY FIFTH OF JUNE I REMEMBER STILL MORE DISTINCTLY THAT WHILE HE WAS PRONOUNCED BY ALL PARTIES AT FIRST SIGHT THE MOST REMARKABLE MAN IN THE WORLD
8238-274553-0004 NO PERSON MADE ANY ATTEMPT AT ACCOUNTING FOR HIS OPINION THAT HE WAS UNIQUE APPEARED SO UNDENIABLE THAT IT WAS DEEMED IMPERTINENT TO INQUIRE WHEREIN THE UNIQUITY CONSISTED
8238-274553-0005 BUT LETTING THIS MATTER PASS FOR THE PRESENT I WILL MERELY OBSERVE THAT FROM THE FIRST MOMENT OF HIS SETTING FOOT WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE UNIVERSITY HE BEGAN TO EXERCISE OVER THE HABITS
8238-274553-0006 MANNERS PERSONS PURSES AND PROPENSITIES OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY WHICH SURROUNDED HIM AN INFLUENCE THE MOST EXTENSIVE AND DESPOTIC YET AT THE SAME TIME THE MOST INDEFINITE AND ALTOGETHER UNACCOUNTABLE
8238-274553-0007 THAT VERY EXTRAORDINARY EPOCH FORMING THE DOMINATION OF THE BARON RITZNER VON JUNG THEN OF NO PARTICULAR AGE BY WHICH I MEAN THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FORM A GUESS RESPECTING HIS AGE BY ANY DATA PERSONALLY AFFORDED
8238-274553-0008 HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN FIFTEEN OR FIFTY
8238-274553-0009 HE WAS BY NO MEANS A HANDSOME MAN PERHAPS THE REVERSE THE CONTOUR OF HIS FACE WAS SOMEWHAT ANGULAR AND HARSH HIS FOREHEAD WAS LOFTY AND VERY FAIR HIS NOSE A SNUB
8238-274553-0010 AFTER SUCH A FASHION THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE ANY EVEN THE MOST COMPLEX COMBINATION OF HUMAN FEATURES CONVEYING SO ENTIRELY AND SO SINGLY THE IDEA OF UNMITIGATED GRAVITY
8238-274553-0011 SOLEMNITY AND REPOSE IT WILL BE PERCEIVED NO DOUBT FROM WHAT I HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT THE BARON WAS ONE OF THOSE HUMAN ANOMALIES NOW AND THEN TO BE FOUND WHO MAKE THE SCIENCE OF MYSTIFICATION
8238-274553-0012 THE STUDY AND THE BUSINESS OF THEIR LIVES FOR THIS SCIENCE A PECULIAR TURN OF MIND GAVE HIM INSTINCTIVELY THE CUE
8238-274553-0013 I QUAINTLY TERMED THE DOMINATION OF THE BARON RITZNER VON JUNG EVER RIGHTLY ENTERED INTO THE MYSTERY WHICH OVERSHADOWED HIS CHARACTER I TRULY THINK THAT NO PERSON AT THE UNIVERSITY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MYSELF
8238-274553-0014 EVER SUSPECTED HIM TO BE CAPABLE OF A JOKE VERBAL OR PRACTICAL THE OLD BULL DOG AT THE GARDEN GATE WOULD SOONER HAVE BEEN ACCUSED THE GHOST OF HERACLITUS OR THE WIG OF THE EMERITUS PROFESSOR OF THEOLOGY
8238-274553-0015 THIS TOO WHEN IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE MOST EGREGIOUS AND UNPARDONABLE OF ALL CONCEIVABLE TRICKS WHIMSICALITIES AND BUFFOONERIES WERE BROUGHT ABOUT IF NOT DIRECTLY BY HIM
8238-274553-0016 LAY IN THAT CONSUMMATE ABILITY RESULTING FROM AN ALMOST INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE AND A MOST WONDERFUL SELF POSSESSION
8238-274553-0017 IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE LAUDABLE EFFORTS HE WAS MAKING FOR THEIR PREVENTION AND FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE GOOD ORDER AND DIGNITY OF ALMA MATER
8238-274553-0018 WHICH UPON EACH SUCH FAILURE OF HIS PRAISE WORTHY ENDEAVORS WOULD SUFFUSE EVERY LINEAMENT OF HIS COUNTENANCE LEFT NOT THE SLIGHTEST ROOM FOR DOUBT OF HIS SINCERITY IN THE BOSOMS OF EVEN HIS MOST SKEPTICAL COMPANIONS
8238-274553-0019 THE ADROITNESS TOO WAS NO LESS WORTHY OF OBSERVATION BY WHICH HE CONTRIVED TO SHIFT THE SENSE OF THE GROTESQUE FROM THE CREATOR TO THE CREATED
8238-274553-0020 FROM HIS OWN PERSON TO THE ABSURDITIES TO WHICH HE HAD GIVEN RISE IN NO INSTANCE BEFORE THAT OF WHICH I SPEAK HAVE I KNOWN THE HABITUAL MYSTIFIC ESCAPE
8238-274553-0021 MY FRIEND APPEARED TO LIVE ONLY FOR THE SEVERITIES OF SOCIETY AND NOT EVEN HIS OWN HOUSEHOLD
8238-274553-0022 WITH THE MEMORY OF THE BARON RITZNER VON JUNG
8238-274553-0023 LAY LIKE AN INCUBUS UPON THE UNIVERSITY
8238-274553-0024 DURING THE GREATER PART OF THE NIGHT HAD RUN WILD UPON THE ALL ENGROSSING TOPIC OF THE TIMES THE BARON WHO HAD BEEN UNUSUALLY SILENT AND ABSTRACTED IN THE EARLIER PORTION OF THE EVENING
8238-274553-0025 AND DWELT UPON THE BENEFITS AND MORE ESPECIALLY UPON THE BEAUTIES OF THE RECEIVED CODE OF ETIQUETTE IN PASSAGES OF ARMS WITH AN ARDOR AN ELOQUENCE
8238-274553-0026 AN IMPRESSIVENESS AND AN AFFECTIONATENESS OF MANNER WHICH ELICITED THE WARMEST ENTHUSIASM FROM HIS HEARERS IN GENERAL AND ABSOLUTELY STAGGERED EVEN MYSELF WHO WELL KNEW HIM TO BE AT HEART
8238-274553-0027 A RIDICULER OF THOSE VERY POINTS FOR WHICH HE CONTENDED AND ESPECIALLY TO HOLD THE ENTIRE FANFARONADE OF DUELLING ETIQUETTE IN THE SOVEREIGN CONTEMPT WHICH IT DESERVES
8238-274553-0028 LOOKING AROUND ME DURING A PAUSE IN THE BARON'S DISCOURSE OF WHICH MY READERS MAY GATHER SOME FAINT IDEA WHEN I SAY THAT IT BORE RESEMBLANCE TO THE FERVID CHANTING MONOTONOUS YET MUSICAL SERMONIC MANNER OF COLERIDGE
8238-274553-0029 EXCEPT PERHAPS IN THE SINGLE PARTICULAR THAT HE WAS A VERY GREAT FOOL HE CONTRIVED TO BEAR HOWEVER AMONG A PARTICULAR SET AT THE UNIVERSITY A REPUTATION FOR DEEP METAPHYSICAL THINKING
8238-274553-0030 AND I BELIEVE FOR SOME LOGICAL TALENT AS A DUELLIST HE HAD ACQUIRED WHO HAD FALLEN AT HIS HANDS BUT THEY WERE MANY HE WAS A MAN OF COURAGE UNDOUBTEDLY
8238-274553-0031 BUT IT WAS UPON HIS MINUTE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE ETIQUETTE OF THE DUELLO AND THE NICETY OF HIS SENSE OF HONOR THAT HE MOST ESPECIALLY PRIDED HIMSELF THESE THINGS WERE A HOBBY WHICH HE RODE TO THE DEATH TO RITZNER
8238-274553-0032 EVER UPON THE LOOKOUT FOR THE GROTESQUE HIS PECULIARITIES HAD FOR A LONG TIME PAST AFFORDED FOOD FOR MYSTIFICATION OF THIS HOWEVER I WAS NOT AWARE
8238-274553-0033 I PERCEIVED THE EXCITEMENT OF THE LATTER MOMENTLY INCREASING AT LENGTH HE SPOKE OFFERING SOME OBJECTION TO A POINT INSISTED UPON BY R AND GIVING HIS REASONS IN DETAIL
8238-274553-0034 TO THESE THE BARON REPLIED AT LENGTH STILL MAINTAINING HIS EXAGGERATED TONE OF SENTIMENT AND CONCLUDING IN WHAT I THOUGHT VERY BAD TASTE WITH A SARCASM AND A SNEER
8238-274553-0035 YOUR OPINIONS ALLOW ME TO SAY BARON VON JUNG ALTHOUGH IN THE MAIN CORRECT ARE IN MANY NICE POINTS DISCREDITABLE TO YOURSELF AND TO THE UNIVERSITY OF WHICH YOU ARE A MEMBER
8238-274553-0036 I WOULD SAY SIR THAT YOUR OPINIONS ARE NOT THE OPINIONS TO BE EXPECTED FROM A GENTLEMAN AS HERMANN COMPLETED THIS EQUIVOCAL SENTENCE ALL EYES WERE TURNED UPON THE BARON
8238-274553-0037 THEN EXCESSIVELY RED THEN DROPPING HIS POCKET HANDKERCHIEF STOOPED TO RECOVER IT WHEN I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HIS COUNTENANCE WHILE IT COULD BE SEEN BY NO ONE ELSE AT THE TABLE
8238-274553-0038 IT WAS RADIANT WITH THE QUIZZICAL EXPRESSION WHICH WAS ITS NATURAL CHARACTER BUT WHICH I HAD NEVER SEEN IT ASSUME EXCEPT WHEN WE WERE ALONE TOGETHER AND WHEN HE UNBENT HIMSELF FREELY IN AN INSTANT AFTERWARD HE STOOD ERECT
8238-274553-0039 FOR A MOMENT I EVEN FANCIED THAT I HAD MISCONCEIVED HIM AND THAT HE WAS IN SOBER EARNEST HE APPEARED TO BE STIFLING WITH PASSION AND HIS FACE WAS CADAVEROUSLY WHITE
8238-274553-0040 FOR A SHORT TIME HE REMAINED SILENT APPARENTLY STRIVING TO MASTER HIS EMOTION HAVING AT LENGTH SEEMINGLY SUCCEEDED HE REACHED A DECANTER WHICH STOOD NEAR HIM SAYING AS HE HELD IT FIRMLY CLENCHED
8238-274553-0041 THE LANGUAGE YOU HAVE THOUGHT PROPER TO EMPLOY
8238-274553-0042 IN ADDRESSING YOURSELF TO ME IS OBJECTIONABLE IN SO MANY PARTICULARS THAT I HAVE NEITHER TEMPER NOR TIME FOR SPECIFICATION THAT MY OPINIONS HOWEVER ARE NOT THE OPINIONS TO BE EXPECTED FROM A GENTLEMAN
8238-274553-0043 IS AN OBSERVATION SO DIRECTLY OFFENSIVE AS TO ALLOW ME BUT ONE LINE OF CONDUCT
8238-274553-0044 YOU WILL FORGIVE ME FOR THE MODERATE TAX I SHALL MAKE UPON YOUR IMAGINATION AND ENDEAVOR TO CONSIDER FOR AN INSTANT
8238-274553-0045 THIS BEING DONE THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTY WHATEVER I SHALL DISCHARGE THIS DECANTER OF WINE AT YOUR IMAGE IN YONDER MIRROR AND THUS FULFIL ALL THE SPIRIT IF NOT THE EXACT LETTER OF RESENTMENT FOR YOUR INSULT
8238-274553-0046 WHILE THE NECESSITY OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE TO YOUR REAL PERSON WILL BE OBVIATED WITH THESE WORDS HE HURLED THE DECANTER FULL OF WINE AGAINST THE MIRROR WHICH HUNG DIRECTLY OPPOSITE HERMANN
8238-274553-0047 STRIKING THE REFLECTION OF HIS PERSON WITH GREAT PRECISION AND OF COURSE SHATTERING THE GLASS INTO FRAGMENTS THE WHOLE COMPANY AT ONCE STARTED TO THEIR FEET AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MYSELF AND RITZNER TOOK THEIR DEPARTURE
8238-274553-0048 AS HERMANN WENT OUT THE BARON WHISPERED ME THAT I SHOULD FOLLOW HIM AND MAKE AN OFFER OF MY SERVICES TO THIS I AGREED NOT KNOWING PRECISELY WHAT TO MAKE OF SO RIDICULOUS A PIECE OF BUSINESS
8238-274553-0049 AND TAKING MY ARM LED ME TO HIS APARTMENT I COULD HARDLY FORBEAR LAUGHING IN HIS FACE WHILE HE PROCEEDED TO DISCUSS WITH THE PROFOUNDEST GRAVITY WHAT HE TERMED THE REFINEDLY PECULIAR CHARACTER
8238-274553-0050 AFTER A TIRESOME HARANGUE IN HIS ORDINARY STYLE HE TOOK DOWN FROM HIS BOOK SHELVES A NUMBER OF MUSTY VOLUMES ON THE SUBJECT OF THE DUELLO AND ENTERTAINED ME FOR A LONG TIME
8238-274553-0051 THE THEATRE OF HONOR BY FAVYN
8238-274553-0052 BRANTOME'S MEMOIRS OF DUELS PUBLISHED AT COLOGNE SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX
8238-274553-0053 WITH A FINE MARGIN AND BOUND BY DEROME
8238-274553-0054 AND HAVING THE QUAINT TITLE DUELLI LEX SCRIPTA ET NON
8238-274553-0055 FROM THIS HE READ ME ONE OF THE DROLLEST CHAPTERS IN THE WORLD
8238-274553-0056 PER CONSTRUCTIONEM
8238-274553-0057 ALTHOUGH NOT ONE SYLLABLE OF THE WHOLE MATTER COULD I UNDERSTAND FOR THE LIFE OF ME HAVING FINISHED THE CHAPTER HE CLOSED THE BOOK AND DEMANDED WHAT I THOUGHT NECESSARY TO BE DONE I REPLIED THAT I HAD ENTIRE CONFIDENCE IN HIS SUPERIOR DELICACY OF FEELING
8238-274553-0058 WILL HAND YOU THIS NOTE I FIND IT INCUMBENT UPON ME TO REQUEST AT YOUR EARLIEST CONVENIENCE AN EXPLANATION OF THIS EVENING'S OCCURRENCES AT YOUR CHAMBERS IN THE EVENT OF YOUR DECLINING THIS REQUEST
8238-274553-0059 HAVING PERUSED THE CARTEL HE WROTE THE FOLLOWING REPLY WHICH I CARRIED TO HERMANN SIR THROUGH OUR COMMON FRIEND MISTER P I HAVE RECEIVED YOUR NOTE OF THIS EVENING
8238-274553-0060 UPON DUE REFLECTION I FRANKLY ADMIT THE PROPRIETY OF THE EXPLANATION YOU SUGGEST THIS BEING ADMITTED I STILL FIND GREAT DIFFICULTY OWING TO THE REFINEDLY PECULIAR NATURE OF OUR DISAGREEMENT
8238-274553-0061 I HAVE GREAT RELIANCE HOWEVER ON THAT EXTREME DELICACY OF DISCRIMINATION IN MATTERS APPERTAINING TO THE RULES OF ETIQUETTE
8238-274553-0062 THE NICETY OF YOUR DISCERNMENT IN ALL THE MATTERS HERE TREATED WILL BE SUFFICIENT I AM ASSURED
8238-274553-0063 TO CONVINCE YOU THAT THE MERE CIRCUMSTANCE OF ME REFERRING YOU TO THIS ADMIRABLE PASSAGE OUGHT TO SATISFY YOUR REQUEST AS A MAN OF HONOR FOR EXPLANATION WITH SENTIMENTS OF PROFOUND RESPECT YOUR MOST OBEDIENT SERVANT VON JUNG
8238-274553-0064 HERMANN COMMENCED THE PERUSAL OF THIS EPISTLE WITH A SCOWL WHICH HOWEVER WAS CONVERTED INTO A SMILE OF THE MOST LUDICROUS SELF COMPLACENCY
8238-274553-0065 ET PER SE HAVING FINISHED READING HE BEGGED ME WITH THE BLANDEST OF ALL POSSIBLE SMILES TO BE SEATED WHILE HE MADE REFERENCE TO THE TREATISE IN QUESTION TURNING TO THE PASSAGE SPECIFIED HE READ IT WITH GREAT CARE TO HIMSELF
8238-274553-0066 TO ASSURE HIM THAT THE EXPLANATION OFFERED WAS OF THE FULLEST THE MOST HONORABLE AND THE MOST UNEQUIVOCALLY SATISFACTORY NATURE SOMEWHAT AMAZED AT ALL THIS I MADE MY RETREAT TO THE BARON
8238-274553-0067 HE SEEMED TO RECEIVE HERMANN'S AMICABLE LETTER AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND AFTER A FEW WORDS OF GENERAL CONVERSATION WENT TO AN INNER ROOM AND BROUGHT OUT THE EVERLASTING TREATISE DUELLI LEX SCRIPTA ET NON
8238-274553-0068 HE HANDED ME THE VOLUME AND ASKED ME TO LOOK OVER SOME PORTION OF IT I DID SO BUT TO LITTLE PURPOSE NOT BEING ABLE TO GATHER THE LEAST PARTICLE OF MEANING HE THEN TOOK THE BOOK HIMSELF AND READ ME A CHAPTER ALOUD TO MY SURPRISE
8238-274553-0069 HE NOW EXPLAINED THE MYSTERY
8238-274553-0070 AND EVEN OF PROFUNDITY WHILE IN FACT NOT A SHADOW OF MEANING EXISTED THE KEY TO THE WHOLE WAS FOUND IN LEAVING OUT EVERY SECOND AND THIRD WORD ALTERNATELY
8238-274553-0071 WHEN THERE APPEARED A SERIES OF LUDICROUS QUIZZES UPON A SINGLE COMBAT AS PRACTISED IN MODERN TIMES THE BARON AFTERWARDS INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD PURPOSELY THROWN THE TREATISE IN HERMANN'S WAY
8238-274553-0072 TWO OR THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE ADVENTURE AND THAT HE WAS SATISFIED FROM THE GENERAL TENOR OF HIS CONVERSATION
8238-274553-0073 AND FIRMLY BELIEVED IT TO BE A WORK OF UNUSUAL MERIT UPON THIS HINT HE PROCEEDED
8238-274553-0074 HERMANN WOULD HAVE DIED A THOUSAND DEATHS RATHER THAN ACKNOWLEDGE HIS INABILITY TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE THAT HAD EVER BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT THE DUELLO
8238-283452-0000 INTRODUCTION THE HUMOROUS GHOST IS DISTINCTLY A MODERN CHARACTER IN EARLY LITERATURE WRAITHS TOOK THEMSELVES VERY SERIOUSLY
8238-283452-0001 AND INSISTED ON A PROPER SHOW OF RESPECTFUL FEAR ON THE PART OF THOSE WHOM THEY HONORED BY HAUNTING A MORTAL WAS EXPECTED TO RISE WHEN A GHOST ENTERED THE ROOM AND IN CASE HE WAS SLOW ABOUT IT
8238-283452-0002 HIS SPINE GAVE NOTICE OF WHAT ETIQUETTE DEMANDED IN THE EVENT OF OUTDOOR APPARITION IF A MAN FAILED TO BARE HIS HEAD IN AWE THE ROOTS OF HIS HAIR REMINDED HIM OF HIS REMISSNESS
8238-283452-0003 IN THAT HER LOCKS BEING LONG AND PINNED UP ARE LESS EASILY MOVED WHICH MAY EXPLAIN THE FACT IF IT BE A FACT THAT IN FICTION WOMEN HAVE SHOWN THEMSELVES MORE SELF POSSESSED
8238-283452-0004 WHILE THE FEMININE CAN BE SEEN THROUGH BY ANOTHER WOMAN AND THUS DISARMED THE MAJORITY OF THE COMIC APPARITIONS CURIOUSLY ENOUGH ARE MASCULINE YOU DON'T OFTEN FIND WOMEN WRAITHED IN SMILES
8238-283452-0005 AND HAVE CHIVALROUSLY SPARED THE GENTLER SHADES AND THERE ARE VERY FEW FUNNY CHILD GHOSTS YOU MIGHT ALMOST SAY NONE IN COMPARISON WITH THE NUMBER OF GROWN UPS
8238-283452-0006 THE NUMBER OF GHOST CHILDREN OF ANY OR ALL TYPES IS SMALL PROPORTIONATELY PERHAPS BECAUSE IT SEEMS AN UNNATURAL THING FOR A CHILD TO DIE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
8238-283452-0007 THERE ARE A FEW INSTANCES AS IN THE CASE OF THE GHOST BABY MENTIONED LATER BUT VERY FEW ANCIENT GHOSTS WERE A LONG FACED LOT
8238-283452-0008 SINCE ANY LIVING PERSON HOWEVER SENILE WOULD BE THOUGHT JUVENILE COMPARED WITH A TIMELESS SPOOK BUT IN THESE DAYS OF INDIVIDUALISM AND RADICAL LIBERALISM SPOOKS AS WELL AS MORTALS ARE EXPANDING THEIR PERSONALITIES
8238-283452-0009 AND INDULGING IN GREATER FREEDOM A GHOST CAN CALL HIS SHADE HIS OWN NOW AND EXHIBIT ANY MOOD HE PLEASES EVEN YOUNG FEMALE WRAITHS DEMANDING LATCHKEYS REFUSE TO OBEY THE FROWNING FACE OF THE CLOCK
8238-283452-0010 TO MAKE THE GHOST OF MISSUS GRUNDY TURN A SHADE PALER IN HORROR NOWADAYS HAUNTERS HAVE MORE FUN AND FREEDOM THAN THE HAUNTED IN FACT IT'S MONEY IN ONE'S POCKET THESE DAYS TO BE DEAD FOR GHOSTS HAVE NO RENT PROBLEMS
8238-283452-0011 MANIFESTLY DEATH HAS COMPENSATIONS NOT CONNECTED WITH THE CONSOLATIONS OF RELIGION THE MARVEL IS THAT APPARITIONS WERE SO LONG IN REALIZING THEIR POSSIBILITIES IN IMPROVING THEIR ADVANTAGES
8238-283452-0012 THE SPECTERS IN CLASSIC AND MEDIEVAL LITERATURE WERE MALARIAL VAPOROUS BEINGS WITHOUT ENERGY TO DO ANYTHING BUT THREATEN
8238-283452-0013 AT BEST A REVENANT COULD ONLY RATTLE A RUSTY SKELETON OR SHAKE A MOLDY SHROUD OR CLANK A CHAIN BUT AS MORTALS COWERED BEFORE HIS DEMONSTRATIONS HE DIDN'T WORRY
8238-283452-0014 THE UP TO DATE GHOST KEEPS HIS SKELETON IN A GARAGE OR SOME PLACE WHERE IT IS CLEANED AND OILED AND KEPT IN GOOD WORKING ORDER THE MODERN WRAITH HAS SOLD HIS SHEET TO THE OLD CLO'ES MAN AND DRESSES AS IN LIFE
8238-283452-0015 HE KNOWS THAT THERE'S NO WEAPON NO THREAT IN HORROR TO BE COMPARED WITH RIDICULE THINK WHAT A SOLEMN CREATURE THE GOTHIC GHOST WAS
8238-283452-0016 HOW LITTLE ORIGINALITY AND INITIATIVE HE SHOWED AND HOW DEPENDENT HE WAS ON HIS OWN ATMOSPHERE FOR THRILLS HIS SOLE APPEAL WAS TO THE SPINAL COLUMN THE GHOST OF TO DAY TOUCHES THE FUNNY BONE AS WELL
8238-283452-0017 MANY AMERICANS THERE ARE TO DAY WHO WOULD COURT BEING HAUNTED BY THE CAPTAIN AND CREW OF RICHARD MIDDLETON'S GHOST SHIP THAT LANDED IN A TURNIP FIELD AND DISPENSED DRINK TILL THEY DEMORALIZED THE DENIZENS OF VILLAGE AND GRAVEYARD ALIKE
8238-283452-0018 AFTER THAT SHOW OF SPIRITS THE TURNIPS IN THAT FIELD TASTED OF RUM LONG AFTER THE GHOST SHIP HAD SAILED AWAY INTO THE BLUE THE MODERN SPOOK IS POSSESSED NOT ONLY OF HUMOR BUT OF A CAUSTIC SATIRE AS WELL
8238-283452-0019 HIS JEST IS LIKELY TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE POINT TO IT AND HE CAN HAUNT SO INSIDIOUSLY CAN MAKE HIMSELF SO AT HOME IN HIS HOST'S STUDY OR BEDROOM THAT A MAN ACTUALLY WELCOMES A CHAT WITH HIM
8238-283452-0020 A GHOST MOREOVER THAT TOWERED AND SWELLED AT EVERY HACKNEYED PHRASE TILL FINALLY HE FILLED THE ROOM AND BURST AFTER THE YOUNG MAN PROPOSED TO HIS ADMIRED ONE AND MADE SUBSEQUENT REMARKS
8238-283452-0021 GHOSTS NOT ONLY HAVE APPALLINGLY LONG MEMORIES BUT THEY POSSESS A MEAN ADVANTAGE OVER THE LIVING IN THAT THEY HAVE ONCE BEEN MORTAL
8238-283452-0022 THE MODERN HUMOROUS GHOST SATIRIZES EVERYTHING FROM THE OLD FASHIONED SPECTER HE'S VERY FOND OF TAKING POT SHOTS AT HIM TO THE LATEST PSYCHIC MANIFESTATIONS
8238-283452-0023 HE LAUGHS AT GHOSTS THAT AREN'T EXPERTS IN EFFICIENCY HAUNTING AND HE HAS A LOT OF FUN OUT OF MORTALS FOR BEING SCARED OF SPECTERS HE LOVES TO SHAKE THE LUGUBRIOUS TERRORS OF THE PAST BEFORE YOU
8238-283452-0024 AND USES THE OLD THRILLS ONLY TO SHOW WHAT DEAD BATTERIES THEY COME FROM HIS REALLY ELECTRICAL EFFECTS ARE HIS OWN INVENTIONS HE NEEDS NO DUNGEON KEEPS AND MONKISH CELLS TO PLAY ABOUT IN NOT HE
8238-283452-0025 HE DEMANDS NO RAG NOR BONE NOR CLANK OF CHAIN OF HIS OLD EQUIPMENT TO START ON HIS CAREER HE CAN START UP A MOVING PICTURE SHOW OF HIS OWN AS IN RUTH MC ENERY STUART'S THE HAUNTED PHOTOGRAPH
8238-283452-0026 AND DEMONSTRATE A NEW KIND OF APPARITION THE GHOST STORY OF TO DAY GIVES YOU SPINAL SENSATIONS WITH A DIFFERENCE AS IN THE IMMORTAL TRANSFERRED GHOST BY FRANK R STOCKTON
8238-283452-0027 WHERE THE SUITOR ON THE MOONLIT PORCH ATTEMPTING TO TELL HIS FAIR ONE THAT HE DOTES ON HER SEES THE GHOST OF HER FEROCIOUS UNCLE WHO ISN'T DEAD
8238-283452-0028 KICKING HIS HEELS AGAINST THE RAILING AND HEARS HIS ADMONITION THAT HE'D BETTER HURRY UP AS THE LIVE UNCLE IS COMING IN SIGHT
8238-283452-0029 HAS NEVER BEEN A GHOST NOR USED A WOODEN LEG BUT A TERRIFYING LEG ACY WHILE YOU DO BELIEVE IN IT THE NEW GHOST HAS A MORE NIMBLE AND VERSATILE TONGUE AS WELL AS WIT
8238-283452-0030 IN THE OLDER FICTION AND DRAMA APPARITIONS SPOKE SELDOM
8238-283452-0031 AND GHOSTS LIKE KINGS IN DRAMA WERE OF A DIGNITY AND MUST PRESERVE IT IN THEIR SPEECH OR PERHAPS THE AUTHORS WERE DOUBTFUL AS TO THE DIALOGUE OF SHADES
8238-283452-0032 AND COMPROMISED ON A FEW STATELY EJACULATIONS AS BEING SAFELY PHANTASMAL SPEAKING PARTS BUT COMPARE THAT USAGE WITH THE RUDE FREEDOM OF SOME MODERN SPOOKS
8238-283452-0033 THINK OF HAVING ALWAYS AND ALWAYS TO SPEAK A DEAD LANGUAGE THE HUMOROUS GHOST IS NOT ONLY MODERN BUT HE IS DISTINCTIVELY AMERICAN THERE ARE GHOSTS OF ALL NATIONALITIES NATURALLY
8238-283452-0034 BUT THE SPOOK THAT PROVIDES A JOKE ON HIS HOST OR ON HIMSELF IS YANKEE IN ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT THE DRY HUMOR THE COMIC SENSE OF THE INCONGRUOUS THE WILLINGNESS TO LAUGH AT HIMSELF AS AT OTHERS
8238-283452-0035 AND ARE PRESERVED IN THEIR TRUE FLAVOR I DON'T ASSERT OF COURSE
8238-283452-0036 THE FRENCH AND ENGLISH SELECTIONS IN THIS VOLUME ARE SUFFICIENT TO PROVE THE CONTRARY
8238-283452-0037 THERE ARE VARIOUS ENGLISH STORIES OF WHIMSICAL HAUNTING SOME OF ACTUAL SPOOKS AND SOME OF THE HOAX TYPE HOAX GHOSTS ARE FAIRLY NUMEROUS IN BRITISH AS IN AMERICAN LITERATURE
8238-283452-0038 OF THE EARLY SPECIMENS OF THE REALLY AMUSING GHOST THAT IS AN ACTUAL REVENANT IS THE GHOST BABY IN BLACKWOOD'S WHICH SHOWS ORIGINALITY AND HUMOR YET IS TOO DIFFUSE FOR PRINTING HERE
8238-283452-0039 IN THAT WE HAVE A CONVENTIONAL YOUNG BACHELOR ENGAGED TO A CHARMING GIRL WHO IS ENTANGLED IN SOCIAL COMPLICATIONS AND MADE TO SUFFER MENTAL TORMENT BECAUSE WITHOUT HIS CONSENT
8238-283452-0040 TILL THE PHANTOM COUPLE TAKE A LIKING TO EACH OTHER AND DECIDE TO LET THE LIVING BURY THEIR DEAD THIS IS SUGGESTIVE OF BRANDER MATTHEWS'S EARLIER AND CLEVERER STORY OF A SPECTRAL COURTSHIP IN THE RIVAL GHOSTS
8238-283452-0041 MEDIEVAL AND LATER LITERATURE GAVE US MANY INSTANCES OF A LOVE AFFAIR OR MARRIAGE BETWEEN ONE SPIRIT AND ONE MORTAL
8238-283452-0042 SHOW THE DIVERSITY OF THE ENGLISH HUMOR AS ASSOCIATED WITH APPARITIONS AND ARE ENTERTAINING IN THEMSELVES THE CANTERVILLE GHOST BY OSCAR WILDE IS ONE OF HIS BEST SHORT STORIES
8238-283452-0043 THIS TRAVESTY ON THE CONVENTIONAL TRADITIONS OF THE WRAITH IS PREPOSTEROUSLY DELIGHTFUL ONE OF THE CLEVEREST GHOST STORIES IN OUR LANGUAGE ZANGWILL HAS WRITTEN ENGAGINGLY OF SPOOKS
8238-283452-0044 FRANK R STOCKTON GAVE HIS TO FUNNY SPOOKS WITH A RIOTOUS AND LAUGHING PEN THE SPIRIT IN HIS TRANSFERRED GHOST IS IMPUDENTLY DEATHLESS AND HAS CALLED UP A TRAIN OF SUBSEQUENT HAUNTERS
8238-283452-0045 JOHN KENDRICK BANGS HAS MADE THE DARKER REGIONS SEEM COMFORTABLE AND HOMELIKE FOR US AND HAS CREATED GHOSTS SO HUMAN AND SO FUNNY THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING ONE OR MORE
8238-283452-0046 WE FEEL DOWNRIGHT NEIGHBORLY TOWARD SUCH SPECTERS AS THE FUTILE LAST GHOST NELSON LLOYD EVOKES FOR US AS WE APPRECIATE THE SATIRE OF ROSE O'NEILL'S SOPHISTICATED WRAITH
8238-283452-0047 THE FIELD IS STILL COMPARATIVELY LIMITED BUT A NUMBER OF AMERICANS HAVE DONE DISTINCTIVE WORK IN IT THE SPECTER NOW WEARS MOTLEY INSTEAD OF A SHROUD
83-11691-0000 THIS IS A PAINFUL CHAPTER FOR ME TO WRITE MERCIFULLY IT IS TO BE A SHORT ONE LATER ON I SHALL BECOME USED TO THE SITUATION INCLINED EVEN TO DWELL UPON ITS HUMOROUS SIDE
83-11691-0001 BUT FOR THE MOMENT I CANNOT SEE BEYOND THE SADNESS OF IT THAT TO A PRINCE OF THE ROYAL HOUSE OF ARABY
83-11691-0002 ROGER SCURVILEGS FRANKLY BREAKS DOWN OVER IT THAT ABOMINABLE WOMAN HE SAYS MEANING OF COURSE BELVANE AND HE HAS HYSTERICS FOR MORE THAN A PAGE LET US DESCRIBE IT CALMLY
83-11691-0003 CORONEL CAME BACK FROM HIS STROLL IN THE SAME CASUAL WAY IN WHICH HE HAD STARTED
83-11691-0004 HE WAS NOT THINKING OF UDO HE WAS WONDERING IF PRINCESS HYACINTH HAD AN ATTENDANT OF SURPASSING BEAUTY OR A DRAGON OF SURPASSING MALEVOLENCE IF IN FACT
83-11691-0005 THERE WERE ANY ADVENTURES IN EURALIA FOR A HUMBLE FELLOW LIKE HIMSELF CORONEL SAID A SMALL VOICE BEHIND HIM HE TURNED ROUND INDIFFERENTLY
83-11691-0006 HE SAID ISN'T IT TIME WE WERE STARTING WE AREN'T STARTING SAID THE VOICE WHAT'S THE MATTER WHAT ARE YOU HIDING IN THE BUSHES FOR WHATEVER'S THE MATTER UDO
83-11691-0007 CORONEL STOPPED YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS'S COMMANDS HE BEGAN RATHER COLDLY THERE WAS AN OMINOUS SNIFFING FROM THE BUSHES CORONEL SAID AN UNHAPPY VOICE AT LAST
83-11691-0008 I THINK I'M COMING OUT WONDERING WHAT IT ALL MEANT CORONEL WAITED IN SILENCE YES I AM COMING OUT CORONEL SAID THE VOICE BUT YOU MUSTN'T BE SURPRISED IF I DON'T LOOK VERY WELL
83-11691-0009 I'M I'M CORONEL HERE I AM SAID UDO PATHETICALLY
83-11691-0010 IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT HE WAS SAVE THAT THERE WAS AN IMPRESSION OF MAGNIFICENCE ABOUT HIS PERSON SUCH MAGNIFICENCE ANYHOW AS IS GIVEN BY AN ASTRAKHAN TRIMMED FUR COAT
83-11691-0011 CORONEL DECIDED THAT IT WAS AN OCCASION FOR TACT AH HERE YOU ARE HE SAID CHEERFULLY SHALL WE GET ALONG DON'T BE A FOOL CORONEL SAID UDO ALMOST CRYING
83-11691-0012 WELL THINK OF THAT UDO SHOWED WHAT HE THOUGHT OF IT BY WAVING IT PEEVISHLY THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR TACT HE SAID TELL ME WHAT I LOOK LIKE CORONEL CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT
83-11691-0013 REALLY FRANKLY HE ASKED
83-11691-0014 SAID UDO NERVOUSLY THEN FRANKLY YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS LOOKS FUNNY VERY FUNNY SAID UDO WISTFULLY VERY FUNNY SAID CORONEL HIS HIGHNESS SIGHED
83-11691-0015 I WAS AFRAID SO HE SAID THAT'S THE CRUEL PART ABOUT IT HAD I BEEN A LION THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A CERTAIN PATHETIC SPLENDOUR ABOUT MY POSITION ISOLATED CUT OFF SUFFERING IN REGAL SILENCE
83-11691-0016 HE WAVED AN EXPLANATORY PAW EVEN IN THE MOST HIDEOUS OF BEASTS THERE MIGHT BE A DIGNITY HE MEDITATED FOR A MOMENT HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A YAK CORONEL HE ASKED NEVER
83-11691-0017 I SAW ONE ONCE IN BARODIA IT IS NOT A BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL CORONEL BUT AS A YAK I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY UNLOVABLE ONE DOES NOT LAUGH AT A YAK CORONEL
83-11691-0018 AND WHERE ONE DOES NOT LAUGH ONE MAY COME TO LOVE
83-11691-0019 STRIKING I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YOU SEE TO ONE WHO DIDN'T KNOW YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
83-11691-0020 RABBIT HE SOBBED SO UNDIGNIFIED
83-11691-0021 HE ADDED BITTERLY HOW DID IT HAPPEN I DON'T KNOW CORONEL I JUST WENT TO SLEEP
83-11691-0022 HE SAT UP SUDDENLY AND STARED AT CORONEL IT WAS THAT OLD WOMAN DID IT YOU MARK MY WORDS CORONEL SHE DID IT WHY SHOULD SHE
83-11691-0023 I WAS VERY POLITE TO HER DON'T YOU REMEMBER MY SAYING TO YOU BE POLITE TO HER BECAUSE SHE'S PROBABLY A FAIRY
83-11691-0024 SO THEY HELD A COUNCIL OF WAR PRINCE UDO PUT FORWARD TWO SUGGESTIONS THE FIRST WAS THAT CORONEL SHOULD GO BACK ON THE MORROW AND KILL THE OLD WOMAN THE SECOND
83-11691-0025 WAS THAT CORONEL SHOULD GO BACK THAT AFTERNOON AND KILL THE OLD WOMAN CORONEL POINTED OUT THAT AS SHE HAD TURNED PRINCE UDO INTO INTO A A QUITE SO SAID UDO
83-11691-0026 IT WAS LIKELY THAT SHE ALONE COULD TURN HIM BACK AGAIN AND THAT IN THAT CASE HE HAD BETTER ONLY THREATEN HER I WANT SOMEBODY KILLED SAID UDO RATHER NATURALLY SUPPOSE SAID CORONEL
83-11691-0027 AND MAKE HER TELL ME WHAT SHE KNOWS SHE KNOWS SOMETHING I'M CERTAIN THEN WE SHALL SEE BETTER WHAT TO DO UDO MUSED FOR A SPACE WHY DIDN'T THEY TURN YOU INTO ANYTHING HE ASKED
83-11691-0028 REALLY I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS BECAUSE I'M TOO UNIMPORTANT YES THAT MUST BE IT HE BEGAN TO FEEL A LITTLE BRIGHTER OBVIOUSLY THAT'S IT HE CARESSED A WHISKER WITH ONE OF HIS PAWS
83-11691-0029 THEY WERE AFRAID OF ME HE BEGAN TO LOOK SO MUCH HAPPIER THAT CORONEL THOUGHT IT WAS A FAVOURABLE MOMENT IN WHICH TO WITHDRAW SHALL I GO NOW YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
83-11691-0030 HE MURMURED TO HIMSELF OBVIOUSLY
83-11691-0031 GOOD BYE YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
83-11691-0032 CORONEL GOT ON HIS HORSE AND RODE AWAY AS SOON AS HE WAS OUT OF EARSHOT HE BEGAN TO LAUGH SPASM AFTER SPASM SHOOK HIM NO SOONER HAD HE COMPOSED HIMSELF TO GRAVITY
83-11691-0033 THAN A REMEMBRANCE OF UDO'S APPEARANCE STARTED HIM OFF AGAIN I COULDN'T HAVE STAYED WITH HIM A MOMENT LONGER HE THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE BURST
83-11691-0034 HOWEVER WE'LL SOON GET HIM ALL RIGHT THAT EVENING HE REACHED THE PLACE WHERE THE COTTAGE HAD STOOD BUT IT WAS GONE NEXT MORNING HE RODE BACK TO THE WOOD UDO WAS GONE TOO
83-11691-0035 HE RETURNED TO THE PALACE AND BEGAN TO THINK IT OUT LEFT TO HIMSELF UDO VERY SOON MADE UP HIS MIND THERE WERE THREE COURSES OPEN TO HIM HE MIGHT STAY WHERE HE WAS TILL HE WAS RESTORED TO HEALTH
83-11691-0036 THIS HE REJECTED AT ONCE WHEN YOU HAVE THE HEAD OF A RABBIT THE TAIL OF A LION AND THE MIDDLE OF A WOOLLY LAMB THE NEED FOR ACTION OF SOME KIND IS IMPERATIVE
83-11691-0037 HE MIGHT GO BACK TO ARABY
83-11691-0038 SO POPULAR TO ARABY WHERE HE RODE DAILY AMONG HIS FATHER'S SUBJECTS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF CHEERING HIM HOW AWKWARD FOR EVERYBODY ON TO EURALIA THEN
83-11691-0039 WHY NOT THE PRINCESS HYACINTH HAD CALLED FOR HIM WHAT DEVOTION IT SHOWED IF HE CAME TO HER EVEN NOW IN HIS PRESENT STATE OF BAD HEALTH SHE WAS IN TROUBLE
83-11691-0040 ALREADY THEN HE HAD SUFFERED IN HER SERVICE SO AT LEAST HE WOULD SAY AND SO POSSIBLY IT MIGHT BE CORONEL HAD THOUGHT HIM FUNNY BUT WOMEN HAD NOT MUCH SENSE OF HUMOUR AS A RULE
83-11691-0041 SHE WOULD FIND HIM STROKABLE AND THE LION IN HIM
83-11691-0042 SHE WOULD FIND THAT INSPIRING
83-11691-0043 UNTAMABLE IN THE MAN THEY LOVE WELL THERE IT WAS IT WAS NOT AS IF HE HAD CORONEL WITH HIM CORONEL AND HE IN HIS PRESENT HEALTH COULD NEVER HAVE GONE INTO EURALIA TOGETHER
83-11691-0044 THE CONTRAST WAS TOO STRIKING BUT HE ALONE HYACINTH'S ONLY HELP SURELY SHE WOULD APPRECIATE HIS MAGNANIMITY ALSO AS HE HAD TOLD HIMSELF A MOMENT AGO
83-11691-0045 BUT NO DOUBT HE WOULD THINK OF SOME TREMENDOUSLY CUNNING DEVICE LATER ON TO EURALIA THEN WITH ALL DISPATCH HE TROTTED OFF
83-3054-0000 A WOMAN'S LIFE SAVED THE CAUSE OF HER FALLING INTO THE SEA
83-3054-0001 I OMITTED SEVERAL VERY MATERIAL PARTS IN MY FATHER'S JOURNEY ACROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL TO HOLLAND WHICH THAT THEY MAY NOT BE TOTALLY LOST
83-3054-0002 I WILL NOW FAITHFULLY GIVE YOU IN HIS OWN WORDS AS I HEARD HIM RELATE THEM TO HIS FRIENDS SEVERAL TIMES ON MY ARRIVAL SAYS MY FATHER AT HELVOETSLUYS I WAS OBSERVED TO BREATHE WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
83-3054-0003 CARRYING THEIR HEADS AT THE EXTREMITY OF THEIR TAILS I CROSSED CONTINUED HE ONE PRODIGIOUS RANGE OF ROCKS EQUAL IN HEIGHT TO THE ALPS THE TOPS OR HIGHEST PARTS OF THESE MARINE MOUNTAINS
83-3054-0004 ARE SAID TO BE UPWARDS OF ONE HUNDRED FATHOMS BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE SEA ON THE SIDES OF WHICH THERE WAS A GREAT VARIETY OF TALL NOBLE TREES LOADED WITH MARINE FRUIT SUCH AS LOBSTERS CRABS OYSTERS SCOLLOPS
83-3054-0005 FRUIT SHOOK OFF THE BRANCHES OF THE TREE IT GROWS UPON BY THE MOTION OF THE WATER AS THOSE IN OUR GARDENS ARE BY THAT OF THE WIND THE LOBSTER TREES APPEARED THE RICHEST BUT THE CRAB AND OYSTERS WERE THE TALLEST
83-3054-0006 THE PERIWINKLE IS A KIND OF SHRUB IT GROWS AT THE FOOT OF THE OYSTER TREE AND TWINES ROUND IT AS THE IVY DOES THE OAK
83-3054-0007 AS SHE SANK SHE FELL UPON HER SIDE AND FORCED A VERY LARGE LOBSTER TREE OUT OF ITS PLACE IT WAS IN THE SPRING WHEN THE LOBSTERS WERE VERY YOUNG
83-3054-0008 AND MANY OF THEM BEING SEPARATED BY THE VIOLENCE OF THE SHOCK THEY FELL UPON A CRAB TREE WHICH WAS GROWING BELOW THEM THEY HAVE LIKE THE FARINA OF PLANTS UNITED AND PRODUCED A FISH RESEMBLING BOTH
83-3054-0009 I ENDEAVOURED TO BRING ONE WITH ME BUT IT WAS TOO CUMBERSOME AND MY SALT WATER PEGASUS SEEMED MUCH DISPLEASED AT EVERY ATTEMPT TO STOP HIS CAREER WHILST I CONTINUED UPON HIS BACK
83-3054-0010 BESIDES I WAS THEN THOUGH GALLOPING OVER A MOUNTAIN OF ROCKS THAT LAY ABOUT MIDWAY THE PASSAGE AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED FATHOM BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AND BEGAN TO FIND THE WANT OF AIR INCONVENIENT
83-3054-0011 THEREFORE I HAD NO INCLINATION TO PROLONG THE TIME ADD TO THIS MY SITUATION WAS IN OTHER RESPECTS VERY UNPLEASANT I MET MANY LARGE FISH WHO WERE IF I COULD JUDGE BY THEIR OPEN MOUTHS
83-3054-0012 NOT ONLY ABLE BUT REALLY WISHED TO DEVOUR US NOW AS MY ROSINANTE WAS BLIND I HAD THESE HUNGRY GENTLEMEN'S ATTEMPTS TO GUARD AGAINST IN ADDITION TO MY OTHER DIFFICULTIES
83-3054-0013 AS WE DREW NEAR THE DUTCH SHORE AND THE BODY OF WATER OVER OUR HEADS DID NOT EXCEED TWENTY FATHOMS I THOUGHT I SAW A HUMAN FIGURE IN A FEMALE DRESS THEN LYING ON THE SAND BEFORE ME WITH SOME SIGNS OF LIFE
83-3054-0014 WHEN I CAME CLOSE I PERCEIVED HER HAND MOVE I TOOK IT INTO MINE AND BROUGHT HER ON SHORE AS A CORPSE AN APOTHECARY WHO HAD JUST BEEN INSTRUCTED BY DOCTOR HAWES
83-3054-0015 OF LONDON TREATED HER PROPERLY AND SHE RECOVERED SHE WAS THE RIB OF A MAN WHO COMMANDED A VESSEL BELONGING TO HELVOETSLUYS HE WAS JUST GOING OUT OF PORT ON A VOYAGE WHEN SHE HEARING HE HAD GOT A MISTRESS WITH HIM
83-3054-0016 FOLLOWED HIM IN AN OPEN BOAT AS SOON AS SHE HAD GOT ON THE QUARTER DECK SHE FLEW AT HER HUSBAND AND ATTEMPTED TO STRIKE HIM WITH SUCH IMPETUOSITY THAT HE THOUGHT IT MOST PRUDENT TO SLIP ON ONE SIDE
83-3054-0017 AND LET HER MAKE THE IMPRESSION OF HER FINGERS UPON THE WAVES RATHER THAN HIS FACE HE WAS NOT MUCH OUT IN HIS IDEAS OF THE CONSEQUENCE FOR MEETING NO OPPOSITION SHE WENT DIRECTLY OVERBOARD
83-3054-0018 AND IT WAS MY UNFORTUNATE LOT TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR BRINGING THIS HAPPY PAIR TOGETHER AGAIN I CAN EASILY CONCEIVE WHAT EXECRATIONS THE HUSBAND LOADED ME WITH WHEN ON HIS RETURN
83-3054-0019 HE FOUND THIS GENTLE CREATURE WAITING HIS ARRIVAL AND LEARNED THE MEANS BY WHICH SHE CAME INTO THE WORLD AGAIN
83-9960-0000 THE ENIGMA WAS MORE IMPENETRABLE THAN EVER WHO WAS THIS LITTLE ONE WHOM THENARDIER HAD CALLED THE LARK WAS SHE HIS URSULE THE PRISONER HAD NOT SEEMED TO BE AFFECTED BY THAT WORD THE LARK
83-9960-0001 THIS WAS WHAT MARIUS PERCEIVED MOST CLEARLY OF ALL A SORT OF HORRIBLE FASCINATION HELD HIM NAILED TO HIS POST FROM WHICH HE WAS OBSERVING AND COMMANDING THIS WHOLE SCENE THERE HE STOOD
83-9960-0002 ALMOST INCAPABLE OF MOVEMENT OR REFLECTION AS THOUGH ANNIHILATED BY THE ABOMINABLE THINGS VIEWED AT SUCH CLOSE QUARTERS HE WAITED IN THE HOPE OF SOME INCIDENT NO MATTER OF WHAT NATURE
83-9960-0003 AND THEN I WILL GIVE MY LIFE AND MY BLOOD IF NECESSARY BUT I WILL DELIVER HER NOTHING SHALL STOP ME NEARLY HALF AN HOUR PASSED IN THIS MANNER THENARDIER SEEMED TO BE ABSORBED IN GLOOMY REFLECTIONS
83-9960-0004 THE PRISONER DID NOT STIR STILL MARIUS FANCIED THAT AT INTERVALS AND FOR THE LAST FEW MOMENTS HE HAD HEARD A FAINT DULL NOISE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PRISONER ALL AT ONCE THENARDIER ADDRESSED THE PRISONER
83-9960-0005 THINK THAT THE LARK REALLY IS YOUR DAUGHTER
83-9960-0006 THEY WILL BOTH ENTER THE CARRIAGE WITH MY COMRADE BEHIND SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE THE BARRIER THERE IS A TRAP HARNESSED TO TWO VERY GOOD HORSES YOUR YOUNG LADY WILL BE TAKEN TO IT SHE WILL ALIGHT FROM THE FIACRE
83-9960-0007 MY COMRADE WILL ENTER THE OTHER VEHICLE WITH HER AND MY WIFE WILL COME BACK HERE TO TELL US IT'S DONE AS FOR THE YOUNG LADY NO HARM WILL BE DONE TO HER
83-9960-0008 AND JUST AS SOON AS YOU HAVE HANDED OVER TO ME THOSE LITTLE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS SHE WILL BE RETURNED TO YOU IF YOU HAVE ME ARRESTED MY COMRADE WILL GIVE A TURN OF HIS THUMB TO THE LARK THAT'S ALL
83-9960-0009 THE PRISONER UTTERED NOT A SYLLABLE AFTER A PAUSE THENARDIER CONTINUED IT'S VERY SIMPLE AS YOU SEE THERE'LL BE NO HARM DONE UNLESS YOU WISH THAT THERE SHOULD BE HARM DONE
83-9960-0010 I'M TELLING YOU HOW THINGS STAND I WARN YOU SO THAT YOU MAY BE PREPARED HE PAUSED THE PRISONER DID NOT BREAK THE SILENCE AND THENARDIER RESUMED
83-9960-0011 AS SOON AS MY WIFE RETURNS AND SAYS TO ME THE LARK IS ON THE WAY WE WILL RELEASE YOU AND YOU WILL BE FREE TO GO AND SLEEP AT HOME YOU SEE THAT OUR INTENTIONS ARE NOT EVIL
83-9960-0012 WHAT THAT YOUNG GIRL WHOM THEY WERE ABDUCTING WAS NOT TO BE BROUGHT BACK ONE OF THOSE MONSTERS WAS TO BEAR HER OFF INTO THE DARKNESS WHITHER AND WHAT IF IT WERE SHE IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS SHE
83-9960-0013 WHAT WAS HE TO DO DISCHARGE THE PISTOL PLACE ALL THOSE SCOUNDRELS IN THE HANDS OF JUSTICE BUT THE HORRIBLE MAN WITH THE MEAT AXE WOULD NONE THE LESS BE OUT OF REACH WITH THE YOUNG GIRL
83-9960-0014 IT WAS BY THE PERIL OF THE ONE HE LOVED THAT HE FELT HIMSELF RESTRAINED THIS FRIGHTFUL SITUATION WHICH HAD ALREADY LASTED ABOVE HALF AN HOUR WAS CHANGING ITS ASPECT EVERY MOMENT
83-9960-0015 MARIUS HAD SUFFICIENT STRENGTH OF MIND TO REVIEW IN SUCCESSION ALL THE MOST HEART BREAKING CONJECTURES SEEKING HOPE AND FINDING NONE
83-9960-0016 IN THE MIDST OF THIS SILENCE THE DOOR AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE WAS HEARD TO OPEN AND SHUT AGAIN THE PRISONER MADE A MOVEMENT IN HIS BONDS HERE'S THE BOURGEOISE SAID THENARDIER
83-9960-0017 HE HAD HARDLY UTTERED THE WORDS WHEN THE THENARDIER WOMAN DID IN FACT RUSH HASTILY INTO THE ROOM RED PANTING BREATHLESS WITH FLAMING EYES AND CRIED AS SHE SMOTE HER HUGE HANDS ON HER THIGHS SIMULTANEOUSLY
83-9960-0018 FALSE ADDRESS THE RUFFIAN WHO HAD GONE WITH HER MADE HIS APPEARANCE BEHIND HER AND PICKED UP HIS AXE AGAIN SHE RESUMED NOBODY THERE
83-9960-0019 SHE PAUSED CHOKING THEN WENT ON
83-9960-0020 YOU ARE TOO GOOD YOU SEE IF IT HAD BEEN ME I'D HAVE CHOPPED THE BEAST IN FOUR QUARTERS TO BEGIN WITH AND IF HE HAD ACTED UGLY I'D HAVE BOILED HIM ALIVE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO SPEAK AND SAY WHERE THE GIRL IS
83-9960-0021 AND WHERE HE KEEPS HIS SHINERS THAT'S THE WAY I SHOULD HAVE MANAGED MATTERS PEOPLE ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT WHEN THEY SAY THAT MEN ARE A DEAL STUPIDER THAN WOMEN
83-9960-0022 IT'S NOTHING BUT A BIG CARRIAGE GATE
83-9960-0023 AND AFTER ALL THAT RACING AND FEE TO THE COACHMAN AND ALL I SPOKE TO BOTH THE PORTER AND THE PORTRESS A FINE STOUT WOMAN AND THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM MARIUS BREATHED FREELY ONCE MORE
83-9960-0024 WAS SAFE WHILE HIS EXASPERATED WIFE VOCIFERATED
83-9960-0025 FOR SEVERAL MINUTES HE UTTERED NOT A WORD BUT SWUNG HIS RIGHT FOOT WHICH HUNG DOWN AND STARED AT THE BRAZIER WITH AN AIR OF SAVAGE REVERY
83-9960-0026 FINALLY HE SAID TO THE PRISONER WITH A SLOW AND SINGULARLY FEROCIOUS TONE
83-9960-0027 WHAT DID YOU EXPECT TO GAIN BY THAT TO GAIN TIME CRIED THE PRISONER IN A THUNDERING VOICE AND AT THE SAME INSTANT HE SHOOK OFF HIS BONDS THEY WERE CUT
83-9960-0028 THE PRISONER WAS ONLY ATTACHED TO THE BED NOW BY ONE LEG BEFORE THE SEVEN MEN HAD TIME TO COLLECT THEIR SENSES AND DASH FORWARD HE HAD BENT DOWN INTO THE FIREPLACE HAD STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TO THE BRAZIER
83-9960-0029 AND HAD THEN STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP AGAIN AND NOW THENARDIER THE FEMALE THENARDIER AND THE RUFFIANS HUDDLED IN AMAZEMENT AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE HOVEL
83-9960-0030 STARED AT HIM IN STUPEFACTION AS ALMOST FREE AND IN A FORMIDABLE ATTITUDE HE BRANDISHED ABOVE HIS HEAD THE RED HOT CHISEL WHICH EMITTED A THREATENING GLOW
83-9960-0031 WHEN THE POLICE MADE THEIR DESCENT ON IT THIS SOU PIECE WAS ONE OF THOSE MARVELS OF INDUSTRY WHICH ARE ENGENDERED BY THE PATIENCE OF THE GALLEYS IN THE SHADOWS AND FOR THE SHADOWS MARVELS WHICH ARE NOTHING ELSE THAN INSTRUMENTS OF ESCAPE
83-9960-0032 ARE TO JEWELLERS WORK WHAT THE METAPHORS OF SLANG ARE TO POETRY THERE ARE BENVENUTO CELLINIS IN THE GALLEYS
83-9960-0033 THE UNHAPPY WRETCH WHO ASPIRES TO DELIVERANCE FINDS MEANS SOMETIMES WITHOUT TOOLS SOMETIMES WITH A COMMON WOODEN HANDLED KNIFE TO SAW A SOU INTO TWO THIN PLATES
83-9960-0034 TO HOLLOW OUT THESE PLATES WITHOUT AFFECTING THE COINAGE STAMP AND TO MAKE A FURROW ON THE EDGE OF THE SOU IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE PLATES WILL ADHERE AGAIN THIS CAN BE SCREWED TOGETHER AND UNSCREWED AT WILL IT IS A BOX
83-9960-0035 IN THIS BOX HE HIDES A WATCH SPRING AND THIS WATCH SPRING PROPERLY HANDLED CUTS GOOD SIZED CHAINS AND BARS OF IRON THE UNFORTUNATE CONVICT IS SUPPOSED TO POSSESS MERELY A SOU NOT AT ALL
83-9960-0036 HE POSSESSES LIBERTY IT WAS A LARGE SOU OF THIS SORT
83-9960-0037 THEY ALSO FOUND A TINY SAW OF BLUE STEEL WHICH WOULD FIT THE SOU IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PRISONER HAD THIS SOU PIECE ON HIS PERSON AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE RUFFIANS SEARCHED HIM THAT HE CONTRIVED TO CONCEAL IT IN HIS HAND
83-9960-0038 AS HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO BEND DOWN FOR FEAR OF BETRAYING HIMSELF HE HAD NOT CUT THE BONDS OF HIS LEFT LEG THE RUFFIANS HAD RECOVERED FROM THEIR FIRST SURPRISE BE EASY
83-9960-0039 THAT YOU CAN MAKE ME WRITE WHAT I DO NOT CHOOSE TO WRITE THAT YOU CAN MAKE ME SAY WHAT I DO NOT CHOOSE TO SAY HE STRIPPED UP HIS LEFT SLEEVE AND ADDED SEE HERE
83-9960-0040 AT THE SAME MOMENT HE EXTENDED HIS ARM AND LAID THE GLOWING CHISEL WHICH HE HELD IN HIS LEFT HAND BY ITS WOODEN HANDLE
83-9960-0041 THE REVOLTS OF THE FLESH AND THE SENSES WHEN SUBJECTED TO PHYSICAL SUFFERING CAUSE THE SOUL TO SPRING FORTH AND MAKE IT APPEAR ON THE BROW JUST AS REBELLIONS AMONG THE SOLDIERY FORCE THE CAPTAIN TO SHOW HIMSELF
83-9960-0042 THE HORRIBLE GLOWING TOOL DISAPPEARED INTO THE NIGHT WHIRLING AS IT FLEW AND FELL FAR AWAY ON THE SNOW THE PRISONER RESUMED DO WHAT YOU PLEASE WITH ME HE WAS DISARMED
83-9960-0043 SEIZE HIM SAID THENARDIER TWO OF THE RUFFIANS LAID THEIR HANDS ON HIS SHOULDER AND THE MASKED MAN WITH THE VENTRILOQUIST'S VOICE TOOK UP HIS STATION IN FRONT OF HIM
83-9960-0044 READY TO SMASH HIS SKULL AT THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT AT THE SAME TIME MARIUS HEARD BELOW HIM AT THE BASE OF THE PARTITION BUT SO NEAR THAT HE COULD NOT SEE WHO WAS SPEAKING THIS COLLOQUY CONDUCTED IN A LOW TONE
83-9960-0045 THERE IS ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO CUT HIS THROAT THAT'S IT IT WAS THE HUSBAND AND WIFE TAKING COUNSEL TOGETHER THENARDIER WALKED SLOWLY TOWARDS THE TABLE
83-9960-0046 OPENED THE DRAWER AND TOOK OUT THE KNIFE MARIUS FRETTED WITH THE HANDLE OF HIS PISTOL UNPRECEDENTED PERPLEXITY FOR THE LAST HOUR HE HAD HAD TWO VOICES IN HIS CONSCIENCE
83-9960-0047 THE ONE ENJOINING HIM TO RESPECT HIS FATHER'S TESTAMENT THE OTHER CRYING TO HIM TO RESCUE THE PRISONER THESE TWO VOICES CONTINUED UNINTERRUPTEDLY THAT STRUGGLE WHICH TORMENTED HIM TO AGONY UP TO THAT MOMENT
83-9960-0048 MARIUS CAST A WILD GLANCE ABOUT HIM THE LAST MECHANICAL RESOURCE OF DESPAIR ALL AT ONCE A SHUDDER RAN THROUGH HIM AT HIS FEET ON THE TABLE A BRIGHT RAY OF LIGHT FROM THE FULL MOON
83-9960-0049 THIS WAS THE EXPEDIENT OF WHICH HE WAS IN SEARCH THE SOLUTION OF THAT FRIGHTFUL PROBLEM WHICH WAS TORTURING HIM OF SPARING THE ASSASSIN AND SAVING THE VICTIM HE KNELT DOWN ON HIS COMMODE STRETCHED OUT HIS ARM SEIZED THE SHEET OF PAPER
83-9960-0050 SOFTLY DETACHED A BIT OF PLASTER FROM THE WALL WRAPPED THE PAPER ROUND IT AND TOSSED THE WHOLE THROUGH THE CREVICE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE DEN IT WAS HIGH TIME THENARDIER HAD CONQUERED HIS LAST FEARS OR HIS LAST SCRUPLES
83-9960-0051 SHE HANDED IT TO HER HUSBAND WHERE DID THIS COME FROM DEMANDED THENARDIER PARDIE EJACULATED HIS WIFE WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE IT CAME FROM THROUGH THE WINDOW OF COURSE
83-9960-0052 THENARDIER RAPIDLY UNFOLDED THE PAPER AND HELD IT CLOSE TO THE CANDLE IT'S IN EPONINE'S HANDWRITING THE DEVIL HE MADE A SIGN TO HIS WIFE WHO HASTILY DREW NEAR
83-9960-0053 ASKED THE THENARDIER WOMAN WE HAVEN'T THE TIME THROUGH WHAT
83-9960-0054 REPLIED THENARDIER SINCE PONINE HAS THROWN THE STONE THROUGH THE WINDOW IT INDICATES THAT THE HOUSE IS NOT WATCHED ON THAT SIDE THE MASK WITH THE VENTRILOQUIST'S VOICE DEPOSITED HIS HUGE KEY ON THE FLOOR
83-9960-0055 THENARDIER EXCLAIMED ARE YOU MAD ARE YOU CRAZY WHAT A PACK OF BOOBIES YOU WANT TO WASTE TIME DO YOU DRAW LOTS DO YOU BY A WET FINGER BY A SHORT STRAW
83-9960-0056 WITH WRITTEN NAMES THROWN INTO A HAT WOULD YOU LIKE MY HAT CRIED A VOICE ON THE THRESHOLD
831-130739-0000 THE PRINCIPAL CHARACTER IN THE STORY IF YOU PRESUMING YOU ARE OF THE SEX THAT DOES SUCH THINGS IF YOU HAD GONE INTO THE DRAPERY EMPORIUM WHICH IS REALLY ONLY MAGNIFICENT FOR SHOP
831-130739-0001 A PERFECTLY FICTITIOUS CO BY THE BYE OF PUTNEY ON THE FOURTEENTH OF AUGUST EIGHTEEN NINETY FIVE HAD TURNED TO THE RIGHT HAND SIDE WHERE THE BLOCKS OF WHITE LINEN AND PILES OF BLANKETS RISE UP TO THE RAIL FROM WHICH THE PINK AND BLUE PRINTS DEPEND
831-130739-0002 YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN SERVED BY THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THIS STORY THAT IS NOW BEGINNING HE WOULD HAVE COME FORWARD BOWING AND SWAYING
831-130739-0003 WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SHOWING YOU UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AS FOR INSTANCE HATS BABY LINEN GLOVES SILKS LACE OR CURTAINS
831-130739-0004 AND MAKING A KIND OF CIRCULAR SWEEP INVITED YOU TO STEP THIS WAY AND SO LED YOU BEYOND HIS KEN
831-130739-0005 HUCKABACK BLANKETS DIMITY CRETONNE LINEN CALICO ARE CASES IN POINT
831-130739-0006 UNDER WHICH HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES YOU MIGHT IF OF AN OBSERVING TURN OF MIND AND NOT TOO MUCH OF A HOUSEWIFE TO BE INHUMAN HAVE GIVEN THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THIS STORY LESS CURSORY ATTENTION
831-130739-0007 NOW IF YOU HAD NOTICED ANYTHING ABOUT HIM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CHIEFLY TO NOTICE HOW LITTLE HE WAS NOTICEABLE HE WORE THE BLACK MORNING COAT THE BLACK TIE AND THE SPECKLED GREY NETHER PARTS DESCENDING INTO SHADOW AND MYSTERY BELOW THE COUNTER OF HIS CRAFT
831-130739-0008 HAIR OF A KIND OF DIRTY FAIRNESS GREYISH EYES AND A SKIMPY IMMATURE MOUSTACHE UNDER HIS PEAKED INDETERMINATE NOSE HIS FEATURES WERE ALL SMALL BUT NONE ILL SHAPED A ROSETTE OF PINS DECORATED THE LAPPEL OF HIS COAT
831-130739-0009 WE COULD SHOW YOU SOMETHING BETTER OF COURSE NO TROUBLE MADAM I ASSURE YOU SUCH WERE THE SIMPLE COUNTERS OF HIS INTERCOURSE SO I SAY
831-130739-0010 HE WOULD HAVE DANCED ABOUT BEHIND THE COUNTER HAVE NEATLY REFOLDED THE GOODS HE HAD SHOWN YOU HAVE PUT ON ONE SIDE THOSE YOU SELECTED EXTRACTED A LITTLE BOOK WITH A CARBON LEAF AND A TINFOIL SHEET FROM A FIXTURE
831-130739-0011 MADE YOU OUT A LITTLE BILL IN THAT WEAK FLOURISHING HAND PECULIAR TO DRAPERS
831-130739-0012 SAYN THEN A PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WOULD HAVE COME INTO VIEW
831-130739-0013 HAVE SCRIBBLED A STILL MORE FLOURISHING J M ALL OVER THE DOCUMENT HAVE ASKED YOU IF THERE WAS NOTHING MORE HAVE STOOD BY YOU SUPPOSING THAT YOU WERE PAYING CASH UNTIL THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THIS STORY REAPPEARED WITH THE CHANGE
831-130739-0014 ONE GLANCE MORE AT HIM AND THE PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WOULD HAVE BEEN BOWING YOU OUT WITH FOUNTAINS OF CIVILITIES AT WORK ALL ABOUT YOU
831-130739-0015 BUT REAL LITERATURE AS DISTINGUISHED FROM ANECDOTE DOES NOT CONCERN ITSELF WITH SUPERFICIAL APPEARANCES ALONE LITERATURE IS REVELATION MODERN LITERATURE IS INDECOROUS REVELATION
831-130739-0016 IT IS THE DUTY OF THE EARNEST AUTHOR TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN EVEN AT THE COST OF SOME BLUSHES AND THE THING THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN ABOUT THIS YOUNG MAN AND THE THING OF THE GREATEST MOMENT TO THIS STORY
831-130739-0017 THE THING THAT MUST BE TOLD IF THE BOOK IS TO BE WRITTEN WAS LET US FACE IT BRAVELY THE REMARKABLE CONDITION OF THIS YOUNG MAN'S LEGS LET US APPROACH THE BUSINESS WITH DISPASSIONATE EXPLICITNESS
831-130739-0018 LET US ASSUME SOMETHING OF THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT THE HARD ALMOST PROFESSORIAL TONE OF THE CONSCIENTIOUS REALIST LET US TREAT THIS YOUNG MAN'S LEGS AS A MERE DIAGRAM AND INDICATE THE POINTS OF INTEREST WITH THE UNEMOTIONAL
831-130739-0019 AND SO TO OUR REVELATION ON THE INTERNAL ASPECT OF THE RIGHT ANKLE OF THIS YOUNG MAN YOU WOULD HAVE OBSERVED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN A CONTUSION AND AN ABRASION ON THE INTERNAL ASPECT OF THE LEFT ANKLE A CONTUSION ALSO
831-130739-0020 ON ITS EXTERNAL ASPECT A LARGE YELLOWISH BRUISE ON HIS LEFT SHIN THERE WERE TWO BRUISES ONE A LEADEN YELLOW GRADUATING HERE AND THERE INTO PURPLE AND ANOTHER OBVIOUSLY OF MORE RECENT DATE OF A BLOTCHY RED
831-130739-0021 TUMID AND THREATENING PROCEEDING UP THE LEFT LEG IN A SPIRAL MANNER AN UNNATURAL HARDNESS AND REDNESS WOULD HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED ON THE UPPER ASPECT OF THE CALF
831-130739-0022 AND ABOVE THE KNEE AND ON THE INNER SIDE AN EXTRAORDINARY EXPANSE OF BRUISED SURFACE A KIND OF CLOSELY STIPPLED SHADING OF CONTUSED POINTS
831-130739-0023 THE RIGHT LEG WOULD BE FOUND TO BE BRUISED IN A MARVELLOUS MANNER ALL ABOUT AND UNDER THE KNEE AND PARTICULARLY ON THE INTERIOR ASPECT OF THE KNEE SO FAR WE MAY PROCEED WITH OUR DETAILS
831-130739-0024 FIRED BY THESE DISCOVERIES AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE PURSUED HIS INQUIRIES FURTHER TO BRUISES ON THE SHOULDERS ELBOWS AND EVEN THE FINGER JOINTS OF THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF OUR STORY
831-130739-0025 HE HAD INDEED BEEN BUMPED AND BATTERED AT AN EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER OF POINTS BUT ENOUGH OF REALISTIC DESCRIPTION IS AS GOOD AS A FEAST
831-130739-0026 EVEN IN LITERATURE ONE MUST KNOW WHERE TO DRAW THE LINE NOW THE READER MAY BE INCLINED TO WONDER HOW A RESPECTABLE YOUNG SHOPMAN
831-130739-0027 ONE MIGHT FANCY THAT HE HAD BEEN SITTING WITH HIS NETHER EXTREMITIES IN SOME COMPLICATED MACHINERY A THRESHING MACHINE SAY OR ONE OF THOSE HAY MAKING FURIES BUT SHERLOCK HOLMES
831-130739-0028 WOULD HAVE FANCIED NOTHING OF THE KIND
831-130739-0029 CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE OTHER ABRASIONS AND CONTUSIONS POINTED UNMISTAKABLY TO THE VIOLENT IMPACT OF THE MOUNTING BEGINNER UPON THE BICYCLING SADDLE AND THAT THE RUINOUS STATE OF THE RIGHT KNEE WAS EQUALLY ELOQUENT
831-130739-0030 OF THE CONCUSSIONS ATTENDANT ON THAT PERSON'S HASTY FREQUENTLY CAUSELESS AND INVARIABLY ILL CONCEIVED DESCENTS ONE LARGE BRUISE ON THE SHIN IS EVEN MORE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PRENTICE CYCLIST
831-130739-0031 FOR UPON EVERY ONE OF THEM WAITS THE JEST OF THE UNEXPECTED TREADLE YOU TRY AT LEAST TO WALK YOUR MACHINE IN AN EASY MANNER AND WHACK YOU ARE RUBBING YOUR SHIN SO OUT OF INNOCENCE WE RIPEN
831-130739-0032 TWO BRUISES ON THAT PLACE MARK A CERTAIN WANT OF APTITUDE IN LEARNING SUCH AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT IN A PERSON UNUSED TO MUSCULAR EXERCISE BLISTERS ON THE HANDS ARE ELOQUENT OF THE NERVOUS CLUTCH OF THE WAVERING RIDER AND SO FORTH
831-130739-0033 UNTIL SHERLOCK IS PRESENTLY EXPLAINING BY THE HELP OF THE MINOR INJURIES THAT THE MACHINE RIDDEN IS AN OLD FASHIONED AFFAIR WITH A FORK INSTEAD OF THE DIAMOND FRAME A CUSHIONED TIRE WELL WORN ON THE HIND WHEEL
831-130739-0034 RISES A VISION OF A NIGHTLY STRUGGLE OF TWO DARK FIGURES AND A MACHINE IN A DARK ROAD THE ROAD TO BE EXPLICIT FROM ROEHAMPTON TO PUTNEY HILL AND WITH THIS VISION IS THE SOUND OF A HEEL SPURNING THE GRAVEL
831-130739-0035 A GASPING AND GRUNTING A SHOUTING OF STEER MAN STEER A WAVERING UNSTEADY FLIGHT A SPASMODIC TURNING OF THE MISSILE EDIFICE OF MAN AND MACHINE AND A COLLAPSE THEN YOU DESCRY DIMLY THROUGH THE DUSK
831-130739-0036 THUS EVEN IN A SHOP ASSISTANT DOES THE WARMTH OF MANHOOD ASSERT ITSELF AND DRIVE HIM AGAINST ALL THE CONDITIONS OF HIS CALLING AGAINST THE COUNSELS OF PRUDENCE AND THE RESTRICTIONS OF HIS MEANS
831-130739-0037 TO SEEK THE WHOLESOME DELIGHTS OF EXERTION AND DANGER AND PAIN AND OUR FIRST EXAMINATION OF THE DRAPER REVEALS BENEATH HIS DRAPERIES THE MAN TO WHICH INITIAL FACT AMONG OTHERS WE SHALL COME AGAIN IN THE END
831-130739-0038 BUT ENOUGH OF THESE REVELATIONS THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF OUR STORY IS NOW GOING ALONG BEHIND THE COUNTER A DRAPER INDEED WITH YOUR PURCHASES IN HIS ARMS TO THE WAREHOUSE WHERE THE VARIOUS ARTICLES YOU HAVE SELECTED WILL PRESENTLY BE PACKED BY THE SENIOR PORTER AND SENT TO YOU
831-130739-0039 AND GRIPPING THE CORNERS OF THE FOLDS IN HIS HANDS BEGINS TO STRAIGHTEN THEM PUNCTILIOUSLY NEAR HIM IS AN APPRENTICE APPRENTICED TO THE SAME HIGH CALLING OF DRAPER'S ASSISTANT
831-130739-0040 A RUDDY RED HAIRED LAD IN A VERY SHORT TAILLESS BLACK COAT AND A VERY HIGH COLLAR WHO IS DELIBERATELY UNFOLDING AND REFOLDING SOME PATTERNS OF CRETONNE
831-130739-0041 THE ASSISTANT IS DREAMING OF THE DELICIOUS TIME ONLY FOUR HOURS OFF NOW WHEN HE WILL RESUME THE TALE OF HIS BRUISES AND ABRASIONS THE APPRENTICE IS NEARER THE LONG LONG THOUGHTS OF BOYHOOD AND HIS IMAGINATION RIDES CAP A PIE
831-130739-0042 THROUGH THE CHAMBERS OF HIS BRAIN SEEKING SOME KNIGHTLY QUEST IN HONOUR OF THAT FAIR LADY THE LAST BUT ONE OF THE GIRL APPRENTICES TO THE DRESS MAKING UPSTAIRS
831-130739-0043 HE INCLINES RATHER TO STREET FIGHTING AGAINST REVOLUTIONARIES BECAUSE THEN SHE COULD SEE HIM FROM THE WINDOW JERKING THEM BACK TO THE PRESENT COMES THE PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WITH A PAPER IN HIS HAND THE APPRENTICE BECOMES EXTREMELY ACTIVE
831-130739-0044 THEY'RE GOING FAIRLY WELL SIR
831-130739-0045 THE SHOP WALKER BRINGS UP PARALLEL TO THE COUNTER ANY PARTICULAR TIME WHEN YOU WANT YOUR HOLIDAYS HE ASKS HOOPDRIVER PULLS AT HIS SKIMPY MOUSTACHE NO DON'T WANT THEM TOO LATE SIR OF COURSE
831-130739-0046 HOW ABOUT THIS DAY WEEK HOOPDRIVER BECOMES RIGIDLY MEDITATIVE GRIPPING THE CORNERS OF THE GINGHAM FOLDS IN HIS HANDS HIS FACE IS ELOQUENT OF CONFLICTING CONSIDERATIONS CAN HE LEARN IT IN A WEEK THAT'S THE QUESTION
831-130739-0047 OTHERWISE BRIGGS WILL GET NEXT WEEK AND HE WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL SEPTEMBER WHEN THE WEATHER IS OFTEN UNCERTAIN HE IS NATURALLY OF A SANGUINE DISPOSITION
831-130739-0048 ALL DRAPERS HAVE TO BE OR ELSE THEY COULD NEVER HAVE THE FAITH THEY SHOW IN THE BEAUTY WASHABILITY AND UNFADING EXCELLENCE OF THE GOODS THEY SELL YOU THE DECISION COMES AT LAST
831-130739-0049 THE NEXT IN THE STRICT SCALE OF PRECEDENCE OF THE DRAPERY EMPORIUM MISTER HOOPDRIVER IN ALTERNATING SPASMS ANON STRAIGHTENS HIS GINGHAM AND ANON BECOMES MEDITATIVE WITH HIS TONGUE IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS DECAYING WISDOM TOOTH
831-130739-0050 AT SUPPER THAT NIGHT HOLIDAY TALK HELD UNDISPUTED SWAY MISTER PRITCHARD SPOKE OF SCOTLAND MISS ISAACS CLAMOURED OF BETTWS
831-130739-0051 I SAID HOOPDRIVER WHEN THE QUESTION CAME TO HIM WHY CYCLING OF COURSE YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO RIDE THAT DREADFUL MACHINE OF YOURS DAY AFTER DAY SAID MISS HOWE OF THE COSTUME DEPARTMENT I AM
831-130739-0052 SAID HOOPDRIVER AS CALMLY AS POSSIBLE PULLING AT THE INSUFFICIENT MOUSTACHE
831-130739-0053 YOU STOW IT SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER LOOKING HARD AND THREATENINGLY AT THE JUNIOR APPRENTICE AND SUDDENLY ADDING IN A TONE OF BITTER CONTEMPT
831-130739-0054 I'M GETTING FAIRLY SAFE UPON IT NOW HE TOLD MISS HOWE AT OTHER TIMES HOOPDRIVER MIGHT HAVE FURTHER RESENTED THE SATIRICAL EFFORTS OF THE APPRENTICE BUT HIS MIND WAS TOO FULL OF THE PROJECTED TOUR TO ADMIT ANY PETTY DELICACIES OF DIGNITY
831-130739-0055 WHEN THE GAS WAS TURNED OFF FOR THE NIGHT HE WAS SITTING ON THE EDGE OF HIS BED RUBBING ARNICA INTO HIS KNEE A NEW AND VERY BIG PLACE AND STUDYING A ROAD MAP OF THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND
831-130739-0056 WAS SITTING UP IN BED AND TRYING TO SMOKE IN THE DARK BRIGGS HAD NEVER BEEN ON A CYCLE IN HIS LIFE BUT HE FELT HOOPDRIVER'S INEXPERIENCE AND OFFERED SUCH ADVICE AS OCCURRED TO HIM HAVE THE MACHINE THOROUGHLY WELL OILED SAID BRIGGS
831-130739-0057 CARRY ONE OR TWO LEMONS WITH YOU DON'T TEAR YOURSELF TO DEATH THE FIRST DAY AND SIT UPRIGHT NEVER LOSE CONTROL OF THE MACHINE AND ALWAYS SOUND THE BELL ON EVERY POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY YOU MIND THOSE THINGS AND NOTHING VERY MUCH CAN'T HAPPEN TO YOU HOOPDRIVER YOU TAKE MY WORD
831-130739-0058 SAVE PERHAPS FOR A CURSE OR SO AT HIS PIPE AND THEN BREAK OUT WITH AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SET OF TIPS AVOID RUNNING OVER DOGS HOOPDRIVER WHATEVER YOU DO
831-130739-0059 NEVER LET THE MACHINE BUCKLE THERE WAS A MAN KILLED ONLY THE OTHER DAY THROUGH HIS WHEEL BUCKLING DON'T SCORCH DON'T RIDE ON THE FOOT PATH KEEP YOUR OWN SIDE OF THE ROAD AND IF YOU SEE A TRAMLINE GO ROUND THE CORNER AT ONCE AND HURRY OFF INTO THE NEXT COUNTY
831-130739-0060 AND ALWAYS LIGHT UP BEFORE DARK YOU MIND JUST A FEW LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT HOOPDRIVER AND NOTHING MUCH CAN'T HAPPEN TO YOU YOU TAKE MY WORD RIGHT YOU ARE SAID HOOPDRIVER GOOD NIGHT OLD MAN GOOD NIGHT SAID BRIGGS
831-130739-0061 HOOPDRIVER RODE OFF INTO DREAMLAND ON HIS MACHINE AND WAS SCARCELY THERE BEFORE HE WAS PITCHED BACK INTO THE WORLD OF SENSE AGAIN SOMETHING WHAT WAS IT NEVER OIL THE STEERING IT'S FATAL
831-130739-0062 A VOICE THAT CAME FROM ROUND A FITFUL GLOW OF LIGHT WAS SAYING AND CLEAN THE CHAIN DAILY WITH BLACK LEAD YOU MIND JUST A FEW LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT
831-130746-0000 THE OSTLER BEING A FOOL RUSHED VIOLENTLY DOWN THE ROAD VOCIFERATING AFTER THEM THEN HE RETURNED PANTING TO THE VICUNA HOTEL AND FINDING A GROUP OF MEN OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCE WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS UP STOPPED TO GIVE THEM THE CREAM OF THE ADVENTURE
831-130746-0001 THAT GAVE THE FUGITIVES FIVE MINUTES THEN PUSHING BREATHLESSLY INTO THE BAR HE HAD TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE BARMAID WHAT THE MATTER WAS AND THE GOV'NOR BEING OUT THEY SPENT SOME MORE PRECIOUS TIME WONDERING WHAT EVER WAS TO BE DONE
831-130746-0002 THERE WERE ALSO MORAL REMARKS AND OTHER IRRELEVANT CONTRIBUTIONS THERE WERE CONFLICTING IDEAS OF TELLING THE POLICE AND PURSUING THE FLYING COUPLE ON A HORSE THAT MADE TEN MINUTES
831-130746-0003 THEN STEPHEN THE WAITER WHO HAD SHOWN HOOPDRIVER UP CAME DOWN AND LIT WONDERFUL LIGHTS AND STARTED QUITE A FRESH DISCUSSION BY THE SIMPLE QUESTION WHICH THAT TURNED TEN MINUTES INTO A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND IN THE MIDST OF THIS DISCUSSION
831-130746-0004 MAKING A SUDDEN AND AWESTRICKEN SILENCE APPEARED BECHAMEL IN THE HALL BEYOND THE BAR WALKED WITH A RESOLUTE AIR TO THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE AND PASSED OUT OF SIGHT YOU CONCEIVE THE BACKWARD PITCH OF THAT EXCEPTIONALLY SHAPED CRANIUM
831-130746-0005 INCREDULOUS EYES STARED INTO ONE ANOTHER'S IN THE BAR AS HIS PACES MUFFLED BY THE STAIR CARPET WENT UP TO THE LANDING TURNED REACHED THE PASSAGE AND WALKED INTO THE DINING ROOM OVERHEAD

831-130746-0018 SHE HAD EVIDENTLY GONE OFF WITH HIM AND THAT LITTLE BUSINESS WAS OVER AND HE WAS HERE STRANDED AND SOLD
831-130746-0019 AND HIS ONLY RAY OF HOPE WAS THAT IT SEEMED MORE PROBABLE AFTER ALL THAT THE GIRL HAD ESCAPED THROUGH HER STEPMOTHER IN WHICH CASE THE BUSINESS MIGHT BE HUSHED UP YET AND THE EVIL HOUR OF EXPLANATION WITH HIS WIFE INDEFINITELY POSTPONED
831-130746-0020 KNICKERBOCKERS WENT FRISKING ACROSS HIS MIND AGAIN AND HE REVERTED TO HIS BLASPHEMIES HE STARTED UP IN A GUSTY FRENZY WITH A VAGUE IDEA OF PURSUIT AND INCONTINENTLY SAT DOWN AGAIN WITH A CONCUSSION THAT STIRRED THE BAR BELOW TO ITS DEPTHS
831-130746-0021 HE BANGED THE ARMS OF THE CHAIR WITH HIS FIST AND SWORE AGAIN
831-130746-0022 I BECHAMEL WHEN WITH AN ABRUPT TAP AND PROMPT OPENING OF THE DOOR STEPHEN ENTERED WITH THE BOURBON
831-130746-0023 THE MOONLIGHT RIDE AND SO THE TWENTY MINUTES LAW PASSED INTO AN INFINITY
831-130746-0024 THE WRETCHED CREATURE HAS ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY SULLIED OUR MODEST BUT TRUTHFUL PAGES WE LEAVE THE EAGER LITTLE GROUP IN THE BAR OF THE VICUNA HOTEL WE LEAVE ALL BOGNOR AS WE HAVE LEFT ALL CHICHESTER
831-130746-0025 AND MIDHURST AND HASLEMERE AND GUILDFORD AND RIPLEY AND PUTNEY AND FOLLOW THIS DEAR FOOL OF A HOOPDRIVER OF OURS AND HIS YOUNG LADY IN GREY OUT UPON THE MOONLIGHT ROAD HOW THEY RODE
831-130746-0026 HOW THEIR HEARTS BEAT TOGETHER AND THEIR BREATH CAME FAST AND HOW EVERY SHADOW WAS ANTICIPATION AND EVERY NOISE PURSUIT FOR ALL THAT FLIGHT MISTER HOOPDRIVER WAS IN THE WORLD OF ROMANCE HAD A POLICEMAN INTERVENED BECAUSE THEIR LAMPS WERE NOT LIT
831-130746-0027 HOOPDRIVER HAD CUT HIM DOWN AND RIDDEN ON AFTER THE FASHION OF A HERO BORN HAD BECHAMEL ARISEN IN THE WAY WITH RAPIERS FOR A DUEL HOOPDRIVER HAD FOUGHT AS ONE TO WHOM AGINCOURT WAS A REALITY AND DRAPERY A DREAM
831-130746-0028 IT WAS RESCUE ELOPEMENT GLORY AND SHE BY THE SIDE OF HIM HE HAD SEEN HER FACE IN SHADOW
831-130746-0029 HE HAD SEEN HER TROUBLED AND HER EYES BRIGHT WITH TEARS BUT WHAT LIGHT IS THERE LIGHTING A FACE LIKE HERS TO COMPARE WITH THE SOFT GLAMOUR OF THE MIDSUMMER MOON THE ROAD TURNED NORTHWARD GOING ROUND THROUGH THE OUTSKIRTS OF BOGNOR
831-130746-0030 THEN AMIDST VILLAS AGAIN SOME WARM AND LAMPLIT SOME WHITE AND SLEEPING IN THE MOONLIGHT THEN BETWEEN HEDGES OVER WHICH THEY SAW BROAD WAN MEADOWS SHROUDED IN A LOW LYING MIST
831-130746-0031 THEY SCARCELY HEEDED WHITHER THEY RODE AT FIRST BEING ONLY ANXIOUS TO GET AWAY TURNING ONCE WESTWARD WHEN THE SPIRE OF CHICHESTER CATHEDRAL ROSE SUDDENLY NEAR THEM OUT OF THE DEWY NIGHT PALE AND INTRICATE AND HIGH
831-130746-0032 AT A FOOTFALL AT A ROUGHNESS IN THE ROAD SHE SEEMED TO BE TOO INTENT UPON ESCAPE TO GIVE MUCH THOUGHT TO HIM
831-130746-0033 HIS MIND BECAME AN ENORMOUS APPRECIATION OF THE POSITION THE NIGHT WAS A WARM WHITE SILENCE SAVE FOR THE SUBTILE RUNNING OF THEIR CHAINS
831-130746-0034 HE LOOKED SIDEWAYS AT HER AS SHE SAT BESIDE HIM WITH HER ANKLES GRACEFULLY RULING THE TREADLES NOW THE ROAD TURNED WESTWARD AND SHE WAS A DARK GREY OUTLINE AGAINST THE SHIMMER OF THE MOON
831-130746-0035 AND NOW THEY FACED NORTHWARDS AND THE SOFT COLD LIGHT PASSED CARESSINGLY OVER HER HAIR AND TOUCHED HER BROW AND CHEEK THERE IS A MAGIC QUALITY IN MOONSHINE IT TOUCHES ALL THAT IS SWEET AND BEAUTIFUL AND THE REST OF THE NIGHT IS HIDDEN
831-130746-0036 IT HAS CREATED THE FAIRIES WHOM THE SUNLIGHT KILLS AND FAIRYLAND RISES AGAIN IN OUR HEARTS AT THE SIGHT OF IT THE VOICES OF THE FILMY ROUTE
831-130746-0037 WHITE DUST HOT UNDERFOOT BLINDING TO THE EYE IS NOW A SOFT GREY SILENCE WITH THE GLITTER OF A CRYSTAL GRAIN SET STARLIKE IN ITS SILVER HERE AND THERE OVERHEAD RIDING SERENELY THROUGH THE SPACIOUS BLUE IS THE MOTHER OF THE SILENCE

8312-279790-0001 COVERED FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN A LONG CRAPE VEIL WHO WEPT AND SOBBED SO MUCH THAT THE KING NOTICED HER SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE DID NOT COME LIKE THE REST TO CONSOLE HIM BUT RATHER TO ENCOURAGE HIS GRIEF
8312-279790-0002 SHE HERSELF HAD LOST THE BEST OF HUSBANDS AND HERE SHE BEGAN TO WEEP SO PROFUSELY THAT IT WAS A WONDER HER EYES WERE NOT MELTED OUT OF HER HEAD THE KING BEGAN TO WEEP IN COMPANY AND TO TALK TO HER OF HIS DEAR WIFE
8312-279790-0003 SHE DID THE SAME OF HER DEAR HUSBAND IN FACT THEY TALKED SO MUCH THAT THEY TALKED THEIR SORROW QUITE AWAY THEN LIFTING UP HER VEIL SHE SHOWED LOVELY BLUE EYES AND DARK EYELASHES
8312-279790-0004 THE KING NOTICED HER MORE AND MORE HE SPOKE LESS AND LESS OF THE DEPARTED QUEEN BY AND BY HE CEASED TO SPEAK OF HER AT ALL THE END WAS THAT HE COURTED THE INCONSOLABLE LADY IN THE BLACK VEIL AND MARRIED HER
8312-279790-0005 BY HIS FIRST MARRIAGE HE HAD ONE DAUGHTER CALLED FLORINA OR THE LITTLE FLORA BECAUSE SHE WAS SO FRESH AND LOVELY AT THE TIME OF HIS SECOND MARRIAGE SHE WAS QUITE FIFTEEN YEARS OLD THE NEW QUEEN ALSO HAD A DAUGHTER
8312-279790-0006 WHO WAS BEING BROUGHT UP BY HER GODMOTHER THE FAIRY SOUSSIO HER NAME WAS TROUTINA BECAUSE HER COMPLEXION WAS ALL SPOTTED LIKE A TROUT'S BACK INDEED SHE WAS ALTOGETHER UGLY AND DISAGREEABLE AND WHEN CONTRASTED WITH FLORINA
8312-279790-0007 THE KING DISPUTED NOTHING INDEED HE NEVER DID THE QUEEN RULED HIM IN ALL THINGS SOME TIME AFTER NEWS CAME THAT KING CHARMING WOULD SHORTLY ARRIVE
8312-279790-0008 WHEN THE QUEEN HEARD THIS NEWS SHE SENT FOR MILLINERS DRESSMAKERS JEWELLERS AND DECKED TROUTINA FROM HEAD TO FOOT BUT TO FLORINA SHE ALLOWED NOT A SINGLE NEW FROCK THE POOR PRINCESS HAD TO PUT ON HER OLD ONE
8312-279790-0009 WHO PRESENTED TO HIM TROUTINA ALL BLAZING WITH JEWELS YET SO UGLY THAT KING CHARMING INVOLUNTARILY TURNED AWAY HIS EYES BUT MADAM IS THERE NOT ANOTHER PRINCESS CALLED FLORINA
8312-279790-0010 HE ROSE AND MADE HER A PROFOUND REVERENCE PAYING HER BESIDES SO MANY ELEGANT COMPLIMENTS THAT THE QUEEN BECAME VERY MUCH DISPLEASED KING CHARMING TOOK NO HEED
8312-279790-0011 BUT CONVERSED WITH FLORINA FOR THREE HOURS WITHOUT STOPPING INDEED HIS ADMIRATION OF HER WAS SO PLAIN THAT THE QUEEN AND TROUTINA BEGGED OF THE KING THAT SHE MIGHT BE SHUT UP IN A TOWER DURING THE WHOLE TIME OF HIS VISIT
8312-279790-0012 FOUR MEN IN MASKS ENTERED AND CARRIED HER OFF LEAVING HER IN A DARK CELL AND IN THE UTMOST DESOLATION MEANTIME KING CHARMING EAGERLY AWAITED HER RE APPEARANCE BUT HE SAW HER NO MORE
8312-279790-0013 AND BY THE QUEEN'S ORDERS EVERY ONE ABOUT HIM SPOKE ALL THE EVIL THEY COULD OF POOR FLORINA BUT HE REFUSED TO BELIEVE ONE WORD NO SAID HE NATURE COULD NOT HAVE UNITED A BASE NATURE TO SUCH A SWEET INNOCENT FACE
8312-279790-0014 FLORINA SHUT UP IN HER TOWER LAMENTED BITTERLY AH WOULD I HAD BEEN SENT HERE BEFORE I SAW THIS AMIABLE PRINCE WHO WAS SO KIND TO ME IT IS TO PREVENT MY MEETING HIM AGAIN THAT THE QUEEN TREATS ME SO CRUELLY
8312-279790-0015 ALAS THE LITTLE BEAUTY I HAVE HAS COST ME SORE THE QUEEN TO WIN KING CHARMING FOR HER DAUGHTER MADE HIM MANY PRESENTS AMONG THE REST AN ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD A GOLDEN HEART
8312-279790-0016 BUT PIERCED BY ONE ONLY THE MOTTO BEING SHE ALONE THE HEART WAS MADE OF A SINGLE RUBY AS BIG AS AN OSTRICH'S EGG
8312-279790-0017 A FINGER'S LENGTH AND THE CHAIN WAS OF PEARLS EACH WEIGHING A POUND WHEN THE YOUNG KING RECEIVED THIS VERY HANDSOME PRESENT HE WAS MUCH PERPLEXED
8312-279790-0018 AS I CANNOT FULFIL IT TO TROUTINA I WOULD RATHER DECLINE THE FAVOUR SHE OFFERS ME THAN BECOME UNWORTHY OF IT CIVIL AS THIS ANSWER WAS IT IRRITATED THE QUEEN AND HER DAUGHTER EXCEEDINGLY
8312-279790-0019 AND WHEN SINCE IN ALL HIS AUDIENCES WITH THEIR MAJESTIES HE NEVER SAW FLORINA HE AT LAST INQUIRED WHERE THE YOUNGER PRINCESS WAS THE QUEEN ANSWERED FIERCELY THAT SHE WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON AND WOULD REMAIN THERE TILL TROUTINA WAS MARRIED
8312-279790-0020 WHEN HE WAS ALONE HE SENT FOR ONE OF HIS ATTENDANTS WHOM HE TRUSTED VERY MUCH AND BEGGED HIM TO GAIN INFORMATION FROM SOME COURT LADY ABOUT THE PRINCESS FLORINA THIS SCHEME SUCCEEDED SO WELL
8312-279790-0021 NEXT NIGHT TROUTINA THICKLY VEILED
8312-279790-0022 KING CHARMING MET HER RECEIVED HER IN HIS ARMS AND VOWED TO LOVE HER FOR EVER THEN HE LIFTED HER INTO THE FAIRY CHARIOT AND THEY SAILED ABOUT IN THE AIR FOR SOME HOURS
8312-279790-0023 BUT AS HE WAS NOT LIKELY TO WISH TO SAIL ABOUT FOR EVER HE AT LAST PROPOSED THAT THEY SHOULD DESCEND TO EARTH AND BE MARRIED TROUTINA AGREED WITH ALL HER HEART BUT WISHED THAT THE CEREMONY SHOULD BE PERFORMED AT HER GODMOTHER'S
8312-279790-0024 MY CHILD REPLIED THE GODMOTHER THAT IS MORE EASILY SAID THAN DONE HE IS TOO DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH FLORINA MEANTIME THE KING WAS LEFT WAITING IN A CHAMBER WITH DIAMOND WALLS SO THIN AND TRANSPARENT
8312-279790-0025 THAT THROUGH THEM HE SAW TROUTINA AND SOUSSIO CONVERSING TOGETHER HE STOOD LIKE A MAN IN A DREAM WHAT AM I BETRAYED HAS THIS ENEMY TO MY PEACE CARRIED AWAY MY DEAR FLORINA
8312-279790-0026 HOW GREAT WAS HIS DESPAIR WHEN SOUSSIO SAID TO HIM IN A COMMANDING VOICE KING CHARMING BEHOLD THE PRINCESS TROUTINA TO WHOM YOU HAVE PROMISED YOUR FAITH MARRY HER IMMEDIATELY

8312-279790-0032 IMMEDIATELY THE KING'S FIGURE CHANGED HIS ARMS FORMED THEMSELVES INTO WINGS HIS LEGS AND FEET TURNED BLACK AND THIN AND CLAWS GREW UPON THEM
8312-279790-0033 HIS BODY WASTED INTO THE SLENDER SHAPE OF A BIRD AND WAS COVERED WITH BRIGHT BLUE FEATHERS HIS EYES BECAME ROUND AND BEADY HIS NOSE AN IVORY BEAK AND HIS CROWN WAS A WHITE PLUME ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD
8312-279790-0034 HE BEGAN TO SPEAK IN A SINGING VOICE AND THEN UTTERING A DOLEFUL CRY FLED AWAY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE FROM THE FATAL PALACE OF SOUSSIO BUT THOUGH HE LOOKED ONLY A BLUE BIRD
8312-279790-0035 THE KING WAS HIS OWN NATURAL SELF STILL AND REMEMBERED ALL HIS MISFORTUNES AND DID NOT CEASE TO LAMENT FOR HIS BEAUTIFUL FLORINA FLYING FROM TREE TO TREE HE SANG MELANCHOLY SONGS ABOUT HER AND HIMSELF
8312-279790-0036 AND WISHED HE WERE DEAD MANY A TIME THE FAIRY SOUSSIO SENT BACK TROUTINA TO HER MOTHER WHO WAS FURIOUS FLORINA SHALL REPENT HAVING PLEASED KING CHARMING CRIED SHE

8312-279790-0040 BUT IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE WHO SHE WAS AND AT DAYLIGHT SHE SHUT THE WINDOW NEXT NIGHT IT WAS BROAD MOONLIGHT AND THEN HE SAW CLEARLY THE FIGURE OF A YOUNG GIRL WEEPING SORE AND KNEW THAT IT WAS HIS BELOVED FLORINA
8312-279790-0041 WHEN SHE PAUSED IN HER LAMENTATIONS ADORABLE PRINCESS SAID HE WHY DO YOU MOURN YOUR TROUBLES ARE NOT WITHOUT REMEDY WHO SPEAKS TO ME SO GENTLY ASKED SHE
8312-279790-0042 A KING WHO LOVES YOU AND WILL NEVER LOVE ANY OTHER SO SAYING HE FLEW UP TO THE WINDOW AND AT FIRST FRIGHTENED THE PRINCESS VERY MUCH FOR SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY THING
8312-279790-0043 AS A BIRD WHO TALKED IN WORDS LIKE A MAN YET KEPT STILL THE PIPING VOICE OF A NIGHTINGALE BUT SOON SHE BEGAN STROKING HIS BEAUTIFUL PLUMAGE AND CARESSING HIM WHO ARE YOU CHARMING BIRD
8312-279790-0044 YOU HAVE SPOKEN MY NAME I AM KING CHARMING CONDEMNED TO BE A BIRD FOR SEVEN YEARS BECAUSE I WILL NOT RENOUNCE YOU AH DO NOT DECEIVE ME I KNOW YOU HAVE MARRIED TROUTINA
8312-279790-0045 SANG THE BLUE BIRD AND TOLD HER HIS WHOLE STORY WHICH COMFORTED HER SO MUCH THAT SHE THOUGHT NO MORE OF HER MISFORTUNES THEY CONVERSED TILL DAYBREAK AND PROMISED FAITHFULLY EVERY NIGHT TO MEET AGAIN THUS
8312-279790-0046 WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I SAW HIS POOR FEATHERS SCATTERED ON THE GROUND AND KNEW THAT HE WAS NO MORE SO SHE GRIEVED ALL DAY LONG THE BEAUTIFUL BLUE BIRD HID IN A HOLLOW TREE SPENT THE HOURS IN THINKING OF HIS PRINCESS
8312-279790-0047 AND SOUGHT FOR SOME DIAMOND EAR RINGS WHICH HE BROUGHT BACK IN HIS BEAK AND WHEN NIGHT CAME OFFERED THEM TO FLORINA SO NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HE BROUGHT HER SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL AND THEY TALKED TOGETHER TILL DAY
8312-279790-0048 WHERE HE SANG HER PRAISES IN A VOICE SO SWEET THAT THE PASSERS BY THOUGHT IT WAS NOT A BIRD BUT A SPIRIT RUMOURS WENT ABOUT THAT THE PLACE WAS HAUNTED AND NO ONE WOULD GO NEAR THE SPOT
8312-279790-0049 AND THOUGH SHE SAW NOBODY AND HE LIVED IN THE HOLLOW OF A TREE THEY ALWAYS FOUND PLENTY TO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER THE MALICIOUS QUEEN TRIED WITH ALL HER MIGHT TO GET TROUTINA MARRIED BUT IN VAIN NOBODY WOULD HAVE HER
8312-279790-0050 IF IT WERE FLORINA NOW SAID THE KINGS OR THE KINGS AMBASSADORS WE SHOULD BE MOST HAPPY TO SIGN THE CONTRACT THAT GIRL THWARTS US STILL SAID THE QUEEN
8312-279790-0051 WHO LIKED TO SEE HER LOVELY AND SHE HAD ADORNED HERSELF WITH ALL THE PRETTY THINGS HE HAD GIVEN HER HE PERCHED ON THE WINDOW SILL AND SHE SAT AT THE WINDOW AND THEY WERE SINGING TOGETHER A DUET WHICH THE QUEEN HEARD OUTSIDE

8312-279791-0005 AND VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED THE QUEEN LEFT HER AND WENT TO HOLD COUNSEL WITH TROUTINA AS TO WHAT WAS TO BE DONE THEY AGREED TO PUT IN FLORINA'S CHAMBER A WAITING MAID WHO SHOULD WATCH HER FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT
8312-279791-0006 WHEN THE PRINCESS LEARNT THIS SHE WAS IN GREAT GRIEF ALAS CRIED SHE I CAN NO LONGER TALK WITH MY BIRD WHO LOVED ME SO
8312-279791-0007 BUT THE SERVING MAID WATCHED HER NIGHT AND DAY AT LAST OVERCOME WITH WEARINESS THE GIRL FELL ASLEEP AND THEN FLORINA OPENED HER LITTLE WINDOW AND SANG IN A LOW VOICE BLUE BIRD BLUE BIRD COME TO MY SIDE
8312-279791-0008 THE BLUE BIRD FLEW TO THE WINDOW SILL AND THEY LAVISHED ON ONE ANOTHER A HUNDRED CARESSES AND TALKED TOGETHER TILL DAWN NEXT NIGHT IT HAPPENED THE SAME TILL THEY BEGAN TO HOPE THAT THE WAITING MAID
8312-279791-0009 WHO WARBLED IN HER EAR AND TOUCHED HER GENTLY WITH HIS BEAK THE SPY LISTENED AND HEARD ALL THEIR CONVERSATION VERY MUCH ASTONISHED THAT A PRINCESS COULD BE SO FOND OF A MERE BIRD WHEN DAY CAME
8312-279791-0010 SHE RELATED ALL TO THE QUEEN AND TROUTINA WHO CONCLUDED THAT THE BIRD COULD BE NO OTHER THAN KING CHARMING THEY SENT THE GIRL BACK TOLD HER TO EXPRESS NO CURIOSITY BUT TO FEIGN SLEEP
8312-279791-0011 AND TO GO TO BED EARLIER THAN USUAL THEN THE POOR DECEIVED PRINCESS OPENED HER LITTLE WINDOW AND SANG HER USUAL SONG BLUE BIRD BLUE BIRD COME TO MY SIDE
8312-279791-0012 BUT NO BLUE BIRD APPEARED THE QUEEN HAD CAUSED SHARP KNIVES TO BE HUNG OUTSIDE THE HOLLOW OF THE TREE HE FLEW AGAINST THEM AND CUT HIS FEET AND WINGS TILL HE DROPPED DOWN COVERED WITH BLOOD
8312-279791-0013 OH FLORINA COME TO MY HELP SIGHED HE BUT SHE IS DEAD I KNOW AND I WILL DIE ALSO AT THAT MOMENT HIS FRIEND THE MAGICIAN
8312-279791-0014 HAD GONE EIGHT TIMES ROUND THE WORLD IN SEARCH OF HIM MADE HIS NINTH JOURNEY AND CAME TO THE TREE WHERE THE POOR BLUE BIRD LAY CALLING OUT KING CHARMING KING CHARMING THE KING RECOGNISED THE VOICE OF HIS BEST FRIEND
8312-279791-0015 WHY CAN I NOT RETURN AND GOVERN IT AS BEFORE I FEAR REPLIED HIS FRIEND THAT THE THING IS DIFFICULT WHO WOULD OBEY A BLUE BIRD AH THAT IS TOO TRUE CRIED THE KING SADLY
8312-279791-0016 PEOPLE ONLY JUDGE BY THE OUTSIDE MEANTIME FLORINA OVERCOME WITH GRIEF FELL DANGEROUSLY SICK AND IN HER SICKNESS SHE KEPT SINGING DAY AND NIGHT HER LITTLE SONG BLUE BIRD BLUE BIRD
8312-279791-0017 COME TO MY SIDE BUT NO ONE REGARDED HER AT LAST A SUDDEN CHANGE TOOK PLACE IN HER FORTUNES THE KING HER FATHER DIED AND THE PEOPLE WHO KNEW SHE WAS HIS HEIR BEGAN TO INQUIRE WITH ONE ACCORD
8312-279791-0018 WHERE WAS THE PRINCESS FLORINA THEY ASSAILED THE PALACE IN CROWDS DEMANDING HER FOR THEIR SOVEREIGN THE RIOT BECAME SO DANGEROUS THAT TROUTINA AND HER MOTHER FLED AWAY TO THE FAIRY SOUSSIO
8312-279791-0019 RESTORED FLORINA'S HEALTH AND GAVE HER STRENGTH TO CALL A COUNCIL AND ARRANGE ALL THE AFFAIRS OF HER KINGDOM THEN SHE DEPARTED BY NIGHT AND ALONE TO GO OVER THE WORLD IN SEARCH OF HER BLUE BIRD THE MAGICIAN
8312-279791-0020 WHO WAS KING CHARMING'S FRIEND WENT TO THE FAIRY SOUSSIO WHOM HE KNEW FOR THEY HAD QUARRELLED AND MADE IT UP AGAIN AS FAIRIES AND MAGICIANS DO MANY TIMES WITHIN THE LAST FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED YEARS
8312-279791-0021 SHE RECEIVED HIM CIVILLY AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE WANTED HE TRIED TO MAKE A BARGAIN WITH HER BUT COULD EFFECT NOTHING UNLESS KING CHARMING WOULD CONSENT TO MARRY TROUTINA THE ENCHANTER FOUND THIS BRIDE SO UGLY
8312-279791-0022 THAT HE COULD NOT ADVISE STILL THE BLUE BIRD HAD RUN SO MANY RISKS IN HIS CAGE THE NAIL IT WAS HUNG UPON HAD BROKEN AND THE KING SUFFERED MUCH IN THE FALL MINETTA THE CAT HAD GLOWERED AT HIM WITH HER GREEN EYES
8312-279791-0023 HE HAD BEEN A LINNET OR A JAY WORSE THAN ALL HIS NEXT HEIR SPREAD REPORTS OF HIS DEATH
8312-279791-0024 UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE MAGICIAN THOUGHT IT BEST TO AGREE WITH SOUSSIO THAT KING CHARMING SHOULD BE RESTORED TO HIS KINGDOM AND HIS NATURAL SHAPE FOR SIX MONTHS ON CONDITION THAT TROUTINA SHOULD REMAIN IN HIS PALACE
8312-279791-0025 BUT HE THOUGHT LESS OF THESE THINGS THAN HOW TO ESCAPE FROM THE HORROR OF MARRYING TROUTINA MEANWHILE THE QUEEN FLORINA IN A PEASANT'S DRESS WITH A STRAW HAT ON HER HEAD AND A CANVAS SACK ON HER SHOULDER
8312-279791-0026 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ALL ALONE GOOD MOTHER REPLIED THE QUEEN I HAVE TOO MANY TROUBLES TO BE PLEASANT COMPANY FOR ANYBODY TELL ME YOUR TROUBLES AND I MAY BE ABLE TO SOFTEN THEM
8312-279791-0027 DO NOT AFFLICT YOURSELF HAPPINESS WILL YET BE YOURS TAKE THESE FOUR EGGS AND WHENEVER YOU ARE IN TROUBLE BREAK THEM AND SEE WHAT ENSUES SO SAYING THE FAIRY VANISHED FLORINA
8312-279791-0028 GREATLY COMFORTED PUT THE EGGS IN HER SACK
8312-279791-0029 SHE WALKED EIGHT DAYS AND NIGHTS WITHOUT STOPPING AND THEN CAME TO A MOUNTAIN MADE ENTIRELY OF IVORY AND NEARLY PERPENDICULAR DESPAIRING OF EVER CLIMBING IT
8312-279791-0030 SHE SANK DOWN AT THE FOOT PREPARED TO DIE THERE WHEN SHE BETHOUGHT HERSELF OF THE EGGS LET ME SEE SAID SHE IF THE FAIRY HAS DECEIVED ME OR NOT SO SHE BROKE ONE AND INSIDE IT WERE LITTLE HOOKS OF GOLD
8312-279791-0031 WHICH SHE FITTED ON HER FEET AND HANDS AND BY MEANS OF WHICH SHE CLIMBED THE MOUNTAIN WITH EASE ARRIVED AT THE SUMMIT SHE FOUND NEW DIFFICULTIES FOR THE VALLEY BELOW WAS ONE LARGE SMOOTH MIRROR
8312-279791-0032 IN WHICH SIXTY THOUSAND WOMEN STOOD ADMIRING THEMSELVES THEY HAD NEED FOR THE CHARM OF THE MIRROR WAS THAT EACH SAW HERSELF THEREIN NOT AS SHE WAS BUT AS SHE WISHED TO BE
8312-279791-0033 AND THE GRIMACES THEY MADE WERE ENOUGH TO CAUSE A PERSON TO DIE OF LAUGHTER NOT ONE OF THEM HAD EVER GAINED THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN AND WHEN THEY SAW FLORINA THERE THEY ALL BURST INTO ANGRY OUTCRIES
8312-279791-0034 WILL YOU CONVEY ME TO THE PALACE OF KING CHARMING THE OBEDIENT PIGEONS DID SO FLYING DAY AND NIGHT TILL THEY REACHED THE CITY GATES WHEN THE QUEEN DISMISSED THEM WITH A SWEET KISS WHICH WAS WORTH MORE THAN HER CROWN
8312-279791-0035 BESIDES HE IS GOING TO MORROW TO THE TEMPLE WITH THE PRINCESS TROUTINA WHOM HE HAS AT LAST AGREED TO MARRY FLORINA SAT DOWN ON A DOOR STEP AND HID HER FACE UNDER HER STRAW HAT AND HER DROOPING HAIR
8312-279791-0036 ALAS SHE CRIED MY BLUE BIRD HAS FORSAKEN ME SHE NEITHER ATE NOR SLEPT BUT ROSE WITH THE DAWN AND PUSHED HER WAY THROUGH THE GUARDS TO THE TEMPLE WHERE SHE SAW TWO THRONES ONE FOR KING CHARMING
8312-279791-0037 AND THE OTHER FOR TROUTINA THEY ARRIVED SHORTLY HE MORE CHARMING AND SHE MORE REPULSIVE THAN EVER KNITTING HER BROWS TROUTINA EXCLAIMED WHAT CREATURE IS THAT WHO DARES APPROACH SO NEAR MY GOLDEN THRONE
8312-279791-0038 THESE ARE PRETTY TRINKETS SAID TROUTINA AND GOING UP TO THE KING SHE ASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THEM AT SIGHT OF THE ORNAMENTS HE TURNED PALE REMEMBERING THOSE HE HAD GIVEN TO FLORINA
8312-279791-0039 THESE BRACELETS ARE WORTH HALF MY KINGDOM I DID NOT THINK THERE HAD BEEN MORE THAN ONE PAIR IN THE WORLD THEN I WILL BUY THESE SAID TROUTINA BUT FLORINA REFUSED TO SELL THEM FOR MONEY
8312-279791-0040 THE PRICE SHE ASKED WAS PERMISSION TO SLEEP A NIGHT IN THE CHAMBER OF ECHOES AS YOU WILL YOUR BARGAINS ARE CHEAP ENOUGH REPLIED TROUTINA LAUGHING AND WHEN SHE LAUGHED SHE SHOWED TEETH LIKE THE TUSKS OF A WILD BOAR
8312-279791-0041 NOW THE KING WHEN HE WAS A BLUE BIRD HAD INFORMED FLORINA ABOUT THIS CHAMBER OF ECHOES WHERE EVERY WORD SPOKEN COULD BE HEARD IN HIS OWN CHAMBER
8312-279791-0042 BUT SHE HAD NO MORE JEWELS TO TEMPT TROUTINA SO SHE BROKE THE THIRD EGG OUT OF IT CAME A CHARIOT OF POLISHED STEEL INLAID WITH GOLD DRAWN BY SIX GREEN MICE THE COACHMAN BEING A ROSE COLOURED RAT
8312-279791-0043 AND THE POSTILION A GREY ONE INSIDE THE CARRIAGE SAT LITTLE PUPPETS WHO BEHAVED THEMSELVES JUST LIKE LIVE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WHEN TROUTINA WENT TO WALK IN THE PALACE GARDEN FLORINA AWAITED HER IN A GREEN ALLEY
8312-279791-0044 AND MADE THE MICE GALLOP AND THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN BOW TILL THE PRINCESS WAS DELIGHTED AND READY TO BUY THE CURIOSITY AT ANY PRICE AGAIN FLORINA EXACTED PERMISSION TO PASS THE NIGHT IN THE CHAMBER OF ECHOES AND AGAIN THE KING
8312-279791-0045 UNDISTURBED BY HER LAMENTATION SLEPT WITHOUT WAKING TILL DAWN THE THIRD DAY ONE OF THE PALACE VALETS PASSING HER BY SAID YOU STUPID PEASANT GIRL IT IS WELL THE KING TAKES OPIUM EVERY NIGHT
8312-279791-0046 OR YOU WOULD DISTURB HIM BY THAT TERRIBLE SOBBING OF YOURS DOES HE SO SAID THE QUEEN NOW COMPREHENDING ALL THEN IF YOU WILL PROMISE TO NIGHT TO KEEP THE OPIUM CUP OUT OF HIS WAY THESE PEARLS AND DIAMONDS
8312-279791-0047 AND SHE TOOK A HANDFUL OF THEM FROM HER SACK SHALL ASSUREDLY BE YOURS THE VALET PROMISED AND THEN FLORINA BROKE HER FOURTH EGG OUT OF WHICH CAME A PIE COMPOSED OF BIRDS WHICH THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN PLUCKED
8312-279791-0048 BAKED AND MADE READY FOR THE TABLE SANG AS BEAUTIFULLY AS BIRDS THAT ARE ALIVE TROUTINA CHARMED WITH THIS MARVELLOUS NOVELTY BOUGHT IT AT THE SAME PRICE AS THE REST ADDING GENEROUSLY A SMALL PIECE OF GOLD
8312-279791-0049 THEN HE ROSE UP DRESSED HIMSELF HASTILY AND WENT IN SEARCH OF HER SHE WAS SITTING MOURNFULLY ON THE FLOOR WITH HER HAIR HIDING HER FACE AND HER EYES SWOLLEN WITH TEARS BUT HE KNEW AT ONCE HIS FAITHFUL FLORINA
8312-279791-0050 AND THEY EMBRACED AND WEPT TOGETHER FOR WHAT WAS THE GOOD OF ALL THEIR LOVE WHEN THEY WERE STILL IN THE POWER OF THE FAIRY SOUSSIO BUT AT THIS MOMENT APPEARED THE FRIENDLY ENCHANTER WITH A FAIRY STILL GREATER THAN SOUSSIO
8312-279791-0051 THE ONE WHO HAD GIVEN FLORINA THE FOUR EGGS THEY DECLARED THAT THEIR UNITED POWER WAS STRONGER THAN SOUSSIO'S AND THAT THE LOVERS SHOULD BE MARRIED WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY WHEN THIS NEWS REACHED TROUTINA SHE RAN TO THE CHAMBER OF ECHOES
8312-279791-0052 AND THERE BEHELD HER BEAUTIFUL RIVAL WHOM SHE HAD SO CRUELLY AFFLICTED BUT THE MOMENT SHE OPENED HER MOUTH TO SPEAK HER WICKED TONGUE WAS SILENCED FOR EVER FOR THE MAGICIAN TURNED HER INTO A TROUT WHICH HE FLUNG OUT OF THE WINDOW
8312-279791-0053 THIS FAMILY LIKENESS MAY BE TRACED IN THE FAIRY TALES OF ALL COUNTRIES I MERELY REFER TO IT TO SHOW THAT THE REPETITION OF INCIDENTS WAS NOT UNOBSERVED OR UNINTENTIONAL
8324-286681-0000 TWO LITTLE CRAYFISHES QUARREL THE DAY AFTER THE EELS LEFT THE POND PEOPLE TALKED OF NOTHING ELSE IT WAS NOT THAT THEY WERE SO MUCH MISSED FOR THE EELS YOU KNOW DO NOT SWIM AROUND IN THE DAYTIME
8324-286681-0001 THE LARGER PEOPLE HAD BEEN SORRY TO HAVE THEM GO AND SOME OF THEM FELT THAT WITHOUT THE EELS AWAKE AND STIRRING THE POND WAS HARDLY A SAFE PLACE AT NIGHT I THINK IT IS A GOOD DEAL SAFER REMARKED A MINNOW WHO USUALLY SAID WHAT SHE THOUGHT
8324-286681-0002 OF COURSE I DO NOT KNOW WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK THEM SAID A STICKLEBACK WHY REPLIED THE MINNOW IF I HAD GONE TO THE EELS AND ASKED THEM THAT
8324-286681-0003 I HAVE HEARD SOME QUEER THINGS ABOUT THE EELS MYSELF SAID THE STICKLEBACK BUT I HAVE NEVER FELT MUCH AFRAID OF THEM I SUPPOSE I AM BRAVER BECAUSE I WEAR SO MANY OF MY BONES ON THE OUTSIDE JUST THEN
8324-286681-0004 A WISE OLD CRAYFISH CAME ALONG WALKING SIDEWISE
8324-286681-0005 THE CRAYFISH STUCK HIS TAIL INTO THE MUD HE OFTEN DID THIS WHEN HE WAS SURPRISED IT SEEMED TO HELP HIM THINK WHEN HE HAD THOUGHT FOR A WHILE HE WAVED HIS BIG PINCHING CLAWS AND SAID
8324-286681-0006 IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME NOT TO TELL WHAT I THINK I USED TO LIVE NEAR THEM THIS SHOWED THAT THE WISE OLD CRAYFISH HAD BEEN WELL BROUGHT UP AND KNEW HE SHOULD NOT SAY UNPLEASANT THINGS ABOUT PEOPLE IF HE COULD HELP IT
8324-286681-0007 WHEN THERE WAS NEED OF IT HE COULD TELL UNPLEASANT TRUTHS AND INDEED THAT VERY EVENING HE DID SAY WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE EELS THAT WAS WHEN HE WAS TEACHING SOME YOUNG CRAYFISHES HIS PUPILS
8324-286681-0008 THEIR MOTHER HAD BROUGHT UP A LARGE FAMILY AND WAS NOT STRONG SHE HAD JUST CAST THE SHELL WHICH SHE HAD WORN FOR A YEAR AND NOW SHE WAS WEAK AND HELPLESS UNTIL THE NEW ONE SHOULD HARDEN ON HER IT IS SUCH A BOTHER SHE SAID
8324-286681-0009 BUT IT IS A COMFORT TO THINK THAT THE NEW ONE WILL LAST A YEAR WHEN I DO GET IT WHILE THEIR MOTHER WAS SO WEAK THE WISE OLD CRAYFISH AMUSED THE CHILDREN AND TAUGHT THEM THINGS WHICH ALL CRAYFISHES SHOULD KNOW EVERY EVENING
8324-286681-0010 THEY GATHERED AROUND HIM SOME OF THEM SWIMMING TO HIM SOME WALKING FORWARD SOME SIDEWISE AND SOME BACKWARD IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THEM WHICH WAY THEY CAME THEY WERE RESTLESS PUPILS AND THEIR TEACHER COULD NOT KEEP THEM FROM LOOKING BEHIND THEM
8324-286681-0011 EACH ONE HAD SO MANY EYES THAT HE COULD LOOK AT THE TEACHER WITH A FEW AND AT THE OTHER LITTLE CRAYFISHES WITH A FEW MORE AND STILL HAVE A GOOD MANY EYES LEFT WITH WHICH TO WATCH THE TADPOLES THESE EYES WERE ARRANGED IN TWO BIG BUNCHES
8324-286681-0012 AND UNLESS YOU LOOKED VERY CLOSELY YOU MIGHT THINK THAT THEY HAD ONLY TWO EYES APIECE THEY HAD GOOD EARS AND THERE WERE ALSO FINE SMELLING BRISTLES GROWING FROM THEIR HEADS
8324-286681-0013 THAT HE HAD NOT SLEPT SO MUCH AS USUAL AND NOW WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WIDE AWAKE HE FELT EXCEEDINGLY DULL AND STUPID WHEN HE TRIED TO WALK HIS EIGHT LEGS STUMBLED OVER EACH OTHER
8324-286681-0014 AND THE WEAK WAY IN WHICH HE WAVED HIS PINCHING CLAW LEGS SHOWED HOW TIRED HE WAS AFTER HE HAD TOLD HIS PUPILS THE BEST WAY TO HOLD THEIR FOOD WITH THEIR PINCHING CLAWS
8324-286681-0015 ONE MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE FELLOW CALLED OUT I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE EELS MY MOTHER WOULD NEVER LET ME GO NEAR THEM AND NOW THEY'VE MOVED AWAY AND I WON'T EVER SEE THEM AND I THINK IT'S JUST HORRID EELS MY CHILDREN SAID THEIR TEACHER
8324-286681-0016 ARE LONG SLENDER SHARP NOSED SLIPPERY PEOPLE WITH A FRINGE OF FINS ALONG THEIR BACKS AND ANOTHER FRINGE ALONG THEIR BELLIES THEY BREATHE THROUGH VERY SMALL GILL OPENINGS IN THE BACKS OF THEIR HEADS
8324-286681-0017 THEY HAVE LARGE MOUTHS AND TEETH IN THEIR MOUTHS AND THEY ARE ALWAYS STICKING OUT THEIR LOWER JAWS AND HOW DO BEGAN THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH ASK ME THAT TO MORROW SAID THEIR TEACHER
8324-286681-0018 STRETCHING HIS EIGHT WALKING LEGS AND HIS TWO PINCHING CLAW LEGS AND HIS TAIL PADDLES BUT REMEMBER THIS ONE THING IF YOU EVER SEE AN EEL GET OUT OF HIS WAY DON'T STOP
8324-286681-0019 SAID ONE LITTLE CRAYFISH WHO THOUGHT IT SMART TO BE SAUCY WE'LL LOOK
8324-286681-0020 ALL OF WHICH MEANT NOTHING AT ALL AND WAS ONLY SAID TO ANNOY HIS TEACHER THEY SCRAMBLED AWAY OVER THE POND BOTTOM
8324-286681-0021 JIGGLING THE YOUNG CLAMS AND RACING WITH EACH OTHER WHERE THE BOTTOM WAS SMOOTH BEAT YOU RUNNING BACKWARD CRIED THE SAUCY CRAYFISH TO THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH AND THEY SCAMPERED ALONG BACKWARD IN THE MOONLIT WATER THERE WAS AN OLD LOG ON THE BOTTOM OF THE POND
8324-286681-0022 AND THEY SAT ON THAT TO REST THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH HAD BEATEN
8324-286681-0023 SAID THE SAUCY ONE POOH SAID THE BIGGEST ONE THAT'S ALL YOU KNOW THEY DON'T RUN ON LAND WELL I GUESS THEY DO REPLIED THE SAUCY ONE
8324-286681-0024 THAT THE EELS HAD COME BACK TO LIVE IN THE OLD POND AGAIN MOTHER EEL OPENED HER BIG MOUTH VERY WIDE ON LAND SHE SAID DECIDEDLY AS SHE SWALLOWED THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH EELS WRIGGLE
8324-286682-0000 THE LUCKY MINK DURING THE WARM WEATHER THE MINKS DID NOT COME OFTEN TO THE POND THEN THEY HAD TO STAY NEARER HOME AND CARE FOR THEIR BABIES IN THE WINTER WHEN FOOD WAS NOT SO PLENTIFUL
8324-286682-0001 AND THEIR YOUNGEST CHILDREN WERE OLD ENOUGH TO COME WITH THEM THEY VISITED THERE EVERY DAY IT WAS NOT FAR FROM THEIR HOME THE MINKS LIVED BY A WATERFALL IN THE RIVER AND HAD BURROWS IN THE BANKS
8324-286682-0002 WHERE THE YOUNG MINKS STAYED UNTIL THEY WERE LARGE ENOUGH TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD THEN THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS WERE VERY BUSY FOR IN EACH HOME THERE WERE FOUR OR FIVE OR SIX CHILDREN HUNGRY AND RESTLESS AND NEEDING TO BE TAUGHT MANY THINGS
8324-286682-0003 THEY WERE RELATED TO THE WEASELS WHO LIVED UP BY THE FARMYARD AND HAD THE SAME SLENDER AND ELEGANT BODIES AND SHORT LEGS AS THEY LIKE THE WEASELS THEY SOMETIMES CLIMBED TREES
8324-286682-0004 THEY DID MOST OF THEIR HUNTING IN THE RIVER SWIMMING WITH THEIR BODIES ALMOST ALL UNDER WATER AND DIVING AND TURNING AND TWISTING GRACEFULLY AND QUICKLY WHEN THEY HUNTED ON LAND THEY COULD TELL BY SMELLING JUST WHICH WAY TO GO FOR THEIR FOOD
8324-286682-0005 THE MINKS WERE A VERY DARK BROWN AND SCATTERED THROUGH THEIR CLOSE SOFT FUR WERE LONG SHINING HAIRS OF AN EVEN DARKER SHADE WHICH MADE THEIR COATS VERY BEAUTIFUL INDEED THE FUR WAS DARKER ON THEIR BACKS THAN ON THE UNDER PART OF THEIR BODIES
8324-286682-0006 AND THEIR TAPERING BUSHY TAILS WERE ALMOST BLACK THEIR UNDER JAWS WERE WHITE AND THEY WERE VERY PROUD OF THEM PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE THEY HAD SO LITTLE WHITE FUR THAT THEY THOUGHT SO MUCH OF IT YOU KNOW THAT IS OFTEN THE WAY
8324-286682-0007 WE THINK MOST OF THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE SCARCE OR HARD TO GET THERE WAS ONE OLD MINK BY THE RIVER WHO HAD A WHITE TIP ON HIS TAIL AND THAT IS SOMETHING WHICH MANY PEOPLE HAVE NEVER SEEN IT IS EVEN MORE UNCOMMON
8324-286682-0008 THAN FOR MINKS TO HAVE WHITE UPPER LIPS AND THAT HAPPENS ONLY ONCE IN A GREAT WHILE THIS MINK WAS A BACHELOR AND NOBODY KNEW WHY SOME PEOPLE SAID IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS WAITING TO FIND A WIFE WITH A WHITE TIP ON HER TAIL
8324-286682-0009 YET THAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOR HE WAS TOO WISE TO WAIT FOR SOMETHING WHICH MIGHT NEVER HAPPEN HOWEVER IT WAS HE LIVED ALONE AND FISHED AND HUNTED JUST FOR HIMSELF HE COULD DIVE MORE QUICKLY
8324-286682-0010 STAY UNDER WATER LONGER AND HUNT BY SCENT BETTER THAN ANY OTHER MINK ROUND THERE HIS FUR WAS SLEEKER AND MORE SHINING THAN THAT OF HIS FRIENDS AND IT IS NO WONDER THAT THE SISTERS OF HIS FRIENDS THOUGHT THAT HE OUGHT TO MARRY
8324-286682-0011 WHEN THE MINKS VISITED TOGETHER SOMEBODY WAS SURE TO SPEAK OF THE BACHELOR'S LUCK THEY SAID THAT WHATEVER HE DID HE WAS ALWAYS LUCKY IT IS ALL BECAUSE OF A WHITE TIP ON HIS TAIL THEY SAID
8324-286682-0012 THAT MAKES HIM LUCKY THE YOUNG MINKS HEARD THEIR FATHERS AND MOTHERS TALKING AND WISHED THAT THEY HAD BEEN BORN WITH WHITE TIPS ON THEIR TAILS SO THAT THEY COULD BE LUCKY TOO ONCE THE BACHELOR HEARD THEM WISHING THIS AND HE SMILED AND SHOWED HIS BEAUTIFUL TEETH
8324-286682-0013 AND TOLD THEM THAT IT WAS NOT THE TIP OF HIS TAIL
8324-286682-0014 AND THE BROTHERS WERE BIGGER THAN THE SISTERS AS MINK BROTHERS ALWAYS ARE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ALL THE SAME AGE ONE WAS VERY MUCH LARGER THAN ANY OF THE REST AND SO THEY CALLED HIM BIG BROTHER
8324-286682-0015 HE THOUGHT THERE WAS NEVER SUCH A FINE MINK AS THE BACHELOR AND HE USED TO FOLLOW HIM AROUND
8324-286682-0016 HE WISHED TO BE JUST LIKE HIM IN EVERY WAY BUT ONE HE DID NOT WANT TO BE A BACHELOR THE OTHER YOUNG MINKS LAUGHED AT BIG BROTHER AND ASKED HIM IF HE THOUGHT HIS TAIL WOULD TURN WHITE IF HE FOLLOWED THE BACHELOR LONG ENOUGH
8324-286682-0017 BIG BROTHER STOOD IT VERY PATIENTLY FOR A WHILE THEN HE SNARLED AT THEM AND SHOWED HIS TEETH WITHOUT SMILING AND SAID HE WOULD FIGHT ANYBODY WHO SPOKE ANOTHER WORD ABOUT IT MINKS ARE VERY BRAVE AND VERY FIERCE
8324-286682-0018 AND NEVER KNOW WHEN TO STOP IF THEY HAVE BEGUN TO FIGHT SO AFTER THAT NOBODY DARED TEASE BIG BROTHER BY SAYING ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THE BACHELOR SOMETIMES THEY DID LOOK AT HIS TAIL AND SMILE BUT THEY NEVER SPOKE
8324-286682-0019 AND HE PRETENDED NOT TO KNOW WHAT THEY MEANT BY IT A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS THE BACHELOR WAS CAUGHT IN A TRAP A COMMON CLUMSY WOODEN TRAP PUT TOGETHER WITH NAILS AND TWINE
8324-286682-0020 IT WAS NOT NEAR THE RIVER AND NONE OF HIS FRIENDS WOULD HAVE FOUND HIM IF BIG BROTHER HAD NOT HAPPENED ALONG HE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE WHAT HE SAW WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT A TRAP HAD DARED TO CATCH A MINK WITH A WHITE TIPPED TAIL
8324-286682-0021 THEN HE HEARD THE BACHELOR GROAN AND HE KNEW THAT IT WAS SO HE HURRIED UP TO WHERE THE TRAP WAS CAN'T YOU GET OUT SAID HE NO SAID THE BACHELOR I CAN'T THE BEST WAY TO GET
8324-286682-0022 OUT IS NOT TO GET IN AND I'VE GOTTEN IN CAN'T YOU DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR LUCKY TAIL TO MAKE THE TRAP OPEN ASKED BIG BROTHER I COULD DO SOMETHING WITH MY TEETH ANSWERED THE BACHELOR IF THEY WERE ONLY WHERE THE TIP OF MY TAIL IS
8324-286682-0023 WHY ARE MINKS ALWAYS WALKING INTO TRAPS HE WAS TRYING HARD NOT TO BE CROSS BUT HIS EYES SHOWED HOW HE FELT AND THAT WAS VERY CROSS INDEED THEN BIG BROTHER BECAME MUCH EXCITED
8324-286682-0024 I HAVE GOOD TEETH SAID HE TELL ME WHAT TO DO IF YOU WILL HELP ME OUT SAID THE BACHELOR I WILL GIVE YOU MY LUCK AND WHAT SHALL I DO WITH THE TAIL I HAVE ASKED THE YOUNG MINK
8324-286682-0025 WHO THOUGHT THAT THE BACHELOR WAS TO GIVE HIM HIS WHITE TIPPED TAIL NEVER MIND NOW ANSWERED THE BACHELOR AND HE TOLD THE YOUNG MINK JUST WHERE TO GNAW FOR A LONG TIME THERE WAS NO SOUND BUT THAT OF THE YOUNG MINK'S TEETH ON THE WOOD OF THE TRAP
8324-286682-0026 THE BACHELOR WAS TOO BRAVE TO GROAN OR MAKE A FUSS WHEN HE KNEW THERE WAS ANYBODY AROUND TO HEAR BIG BROTHER'S MOUTH BECAME VERY SORE AND HIS STOMACH BECAME VERY EMPTY BUT STILL HE KEPT AT WORK HE WAS AFRAID SOMEBODY WOULD
8324-286682-0027 COME FOR THE TRAP AND THE MINK IN IT BEFORE HE FINISHED NOW TRY IT SAID HE AFTER HE HAD GNAWED FOR QUITE A WHILE THE BACHELOR BACKED OUT AS FAR AS HE COULD BUT HIS BODY STUCK IN THE HOLE
8324-286682-0028 YOU ARE RUMPLING YOUR BEAUTIFUL FUR CRIED THE YOUNG MINK NEVER MIND THE FUR ANSWERED THE BACHELOR I CAN SMOOTH THAT DOWN AFTERWARD YOU WILL HAVE TO GNAW A LITTLE ON THIS SIDE
8324-286682-0029 AND HE RAISED ONE OF HIS HIND FEET TO SHOW WHERE HE MEANT IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL HINDFOOT THICKLY PADDED AND WITH SHORT PARTLY WEBBED TOES AND NO HAIR AT ALL GROWING BETWEEN THEM THE CLAWS WERE SHORT SHARP AND CURVED
8324-286682-0030 BIG BROTHER GNAWED AWAY NOW TRY IT SAID HE THE BACHELOR BACKED CAREFULLY OUT THROUGH THE OPENING AND STOOD THERE LOOKING TIRED AND HUNGRY AND VERY MUCH RUMPLED YOU ARE A FINE YOUNG MINK SAID HE
8324-286682-0031 WE WILL GET SOMETHING TO EAT AND THEN WE WILL SEE ABOUT MAKING YOU LUCKY THEY WENT TO THE RIVER BANK AND HAD A GOOD DINNER THE BACHELOR ATE MORE THAN BIG BROTHER FOR HIS MOUTH WAS NOT SORE BUT BIG BROTHER WAS VERY HAPPY
8324-286682-0032 HE THOUGHT HOW HANDSOME HE WOULD LOOK WITH A WHITE TIPPED TAIL AND HOW AFTER HE HAD THAT HE COULD SURELY MARRY WHOEVER HE WISHED IT WAS THE CUSTOM AMONG HIS PEOPLE TO WANT TO MARRY THE BEST LOOKING AND STRONGEST
8324-286682-0033 INDEED IT IS SO AMONG ALL THE POND PEOPLE AND THAT IS ONE REASON WHY THEY CARE SO MUCH ABOUT BEING GOOD LOOKING IT IS VERY HARD FOR A YOUNG MINK TO HAVE THE ONE HE LOVES CHOOSE SOMEBODY ELSE JUST BECAUSE THE OTHER FELLOW
8324-286682-0034 HAS THE BUSHIEST TAIL OR THE LONGEST FUR OR THE THICKEST PADS ON HIS FEET NOW SAID THE BACHELOR WE WILL TALK ABOUT LUCK WE WILL GO TO A PLACE WHERE NOBODY CAN HEAR WHAT WE SAY
8324-286682-0035 THEY FOUND SUCH A PLACE AND LAY DOWN THE BACHELOR ROLLED OVER THREE TIMES AND SMOOTHED HIS FUR HE WAS STILL SO TIRED FROM BEING IN THE TRAP THEN HE LOOKED AT THE YOUNG MINK VERY SHARPLY SO YOU WANT MY TAIL
8324-286682-0036 SAID HE YOU SAID YOU WOULD GIVE ME YOUR LUCK ANSWERED BIG BROTHER AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT YOUR LUCK IS IN YOUR TAIL THE BACHELOR SMILED WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH THE TAIL YOU HAVE SAID HE
8324-286682-0037 I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED BIG BROTHER YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO WEAR TWO ASKED THE BACHELOR OH NO ANSWERED BIG BROTHER
8324-286682-0038 WELL HOW WILL YOU PUT MY TAIL IN PLACE OF YOURS ASKED THE BACHELOR I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED THE YOUNG MINK BUT YOU ARE SO WISE THAT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT KNOW SOME WAY
8324-286682-0039 HE BEGAN TO FEEL DISCOURAGED AND TO THINK THAT THE BACHELOR'S OFFER DIDN'T MEAN VERY MUCH AFTER ALL DON'T YOU THINK SAID THE BACHELOR SLOWLY DON'T YOU THINK THAT IF YOU COULD HAVE MY LUCK
8324-286682-0040 YOU COULD GET ALONG PRETTY WELL WITH YOUR OWN TAIL WHY YES SAID THE YOUNG MINK WHO HAD BEGUN TO FEAR HE WAS NOT GOING TO GET ANYTHING YES BUT HOW COULD THAT BE
8324-286682-0041 THE BACHELOR SMILED AGAIN I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE SAID HE THAT MY LUCK IS NOT IN MY TAIL AND THEY NEVER BELIEVE IT I WILL TELL YOU THE SECRET OF MY LUCK
8324-286682-0042 AND YOU CAN HAVE LUCK LIKE IT IF YOU REALLY CARE ENOUGH HE LOOKED ALL AROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY WAS NEAR AND HE LISTENED VERY CAREFULLY WITH THE TWO LITTLE ROUND EARS THAT WERE ALMOST HIDDEN IN HIS HEAD FUR THEN HE WHISPERED TO BIG BROTHER
8324-286682-0043 THIS IS THE SECRET ALWAYS DO EVERYTHING A LITTLE BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE CAN IS THAT ALL
8324-286682-0044 THAT IS ENOUGH ANSWERED THE BACHELOR KEEP TRYING AND TRYING AND TRYING UNTIL YOU CAN DIVE DEEPER STAY UNDER WATER LONGER RUN FASTER
8324-286682-0045 THEN YOU WILL HAVE GOOD LUCK WHEN THEIRS IS POOR YOU WILL HAVE PLENTY TO EAT WHEN THEY ARE HUNGRY YOU CAN BEAT IN EVERY FIGHT YOU CAN HAVE SLEEK SHINING FUR
8324-286682-0046 SAID HE WHEN I HAVE LEARNED TO DO EVERYTHING IN THE VERY BEST WAY IT WILL BE LUCK OF MY OWN OF COURSE ANSWERED THE BACHELOR
8324-286682-0047 THEN IT IS A KIND OF LUCK THAT CANNOT BE LOST IF I CARRIED MINE IN THE TIP OF MY TAIL SOMEBODY MIGHT BITE IT OFF AND LEAVE ME UNLUCKY BIG BROTHER KEPT THE SECRET
8324-286682-0048 AND WORKED UNTIL HE HAD LEARNED TO BE AS LUCKY AS THE BACHELOR THEN HE MARRIED THE PERSON HE WANTED AND SHE WAS VERY VERY HANDSOME IT IS SAID THAT ONE OF THEIR SONS HAS A WHITE TIPPED TAIL
8324-286683-0000 ONE WARM DAY IN WINTER WHEN SOME OF THE PUSSY WILLOWS MADE A MISTAKE AND BEGAN TO GROW BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT SPRING HAD COME A PARTY OF MUSKRATS WERE VISITING IN THE MARSH BESIDE THE POND ALL AROUND THEM WERE THEIR WINTER HOUSES BUILT OF MUD AND COARSE GRASSES
8324-286683-0001 THESE HOMES LOOKED LIKE HEAPS OF DRIED RUSHES UNLESS ONE WENT CLOSE TO THEM IF ONE DID THAT HE COULD PLAINLY SEE WHAT THEY WERE AND IF ONE HAPPENED TO BE A MUSKRAT AND COULD DIVE AND GO INTO THEM THROUGH THEIR WATERY DOORWAYS
8324-286683-0002 AND ARE AWAKE AT NIGHT WE WISH IT WOULD ALWAYS BE WARM WEATHER SAID THE YOUNG MUSKRATS WHAT'S THE USE OF WINTER HARD TO TELL ANSWERED ONE MUSKRAT
8324-286683-0003 WHO HAD LIVED IN THE MARSH LONGER THAN THE REST HARD TO TELL I KNOW IT ALWAYS GIVES ME A GOOD APPETITE THOUGH THEN ALL THE MUSKRATS LAUGHED THEY WERE A JOLLY GOOD NATURED COMPANY AND EASY TO GET ALONG WITH
8324-286683-0004 THE OTHER POND PEOPLE LIKED THEM MUCH BETTER THAN THEY DID THEIR NEIGHBORS THE MINKS THE WILD DUCKS WHO NESTED IN THE SEDGES WERE QUITE WILLING THAT THE YOUNG MUSKRATS SHOULD PLAY WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND THE MUD HENS WERE NOT AFRAID OF THEM
8324-286683-0005 MUD HENS CANNOT BEAR MINKS THEY SAY THAT WHEN A MUD CHICKEN IS MISSING FROM THE NEST
8324-286683-0006 IN SPRING AND SUMMER WHEN THEY CAN FIND FRESH GRASSES AND YOUNG RUSHES OR A FEW PARSNIPS CARROTS AND TURNIPS FROM THE FARMERS FIELDS OTHER ANIMALS ARE QUITE SAFE IN THE WINTER THEY LIVE MOSTLY ON ROOTS
8324-286683-0007 YES GREAT PITY CHUCKLED THE OLD MUSKRAT HOW GLAD YOU WOULD BE TO SEE THEM HE SMILED ALL AROUND HIS LITTLE MOUTH AND SHOWED HIS GNAWING TEETH
8324-286683-0008 HE KNEW THAT THE FROGS WERE BETTER OFF ASLEEP IN THE MUD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE POND THAN THEY WOULD BE SITTING IN THE SUNSHINE WITH A FEW HUNGRY GULLS ABOVE THEM THE TURTLES WERE SLEEPING ALL WINTER TOO
8324-286683-0009 THE EELS WERE LYING AT THE BOTTOM STUPID AND DROWSY AND SOMEWHERE THE WATER ADDERS WERE HIDDEN AWAY DREAMING OF SPRING OF ALL THE BIRDS WHO LIVED BY THE WATER ONLY THE GULLS WERE THERE AND THEY WERE NOT POPULAR
8324-286683-0010 IT IS TRUE THAT THEY HELPED KEEP THE POND SWEET AND CLEAN AND PICKED UP AND CARRIED AWAY MANY THINGS WHICH MADE THE SHORE UNTIDY STILL THEY WERE RUDE AND TALKED TOO LOUDLY AND WORE THEIR FEATHERS IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY LOOKED LIKE FINE LARGE BIRDS
8324-286683-0011 THE OTHER POND PEOPLE SAID THAT WAS JUST LIKE THEM ALWAYS PRETENDING TO BE MORE THAN THEY REALLY WERE FIFTEEN YOUNG MUSKRATS ALL BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND ALL BORN THE SUMMER BEFORE STARTED OFF TO LOOK AT THE OLD HOME
8324-286683-0012 WHERE THEY WERE CHILDREN TOGETHER THAT IS TO SAY
8324-286683-0013 AND WHEN THEY WERE OLD ENOUGH TO LOOK OUT FOR THEMSELVES FIVE MORE CAME TO LIVE IN THE OLD NEST AND WHEN THESE WERE OLD ENOUGH TO LEAVE THE NEST ANOTHER FIVE WERE BORN IT DOESN'T MEAN SO MUCH TO MUSKRATS TO BE BROTHERS AND SISTERS AS IT DOES TO SOME PEOPLE
8324-286683-0014 AND TO HEAR THEM SLAP THEIR LONG SCALY TAILS ON THE WATER WHEN THEY DOVE THEY HAD SHORT DOWNY FUR ALMOST BLACK ON THE BACK SOFT GRAY UNDERNEATH AND A REDDISH BROWN EVERYWHERE ELSE
8324-286683-0015 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE FUR ON THEIR TAILS OR ON THEIR FEET AND THOSE PARTS WERE BLACK THESE FIFTEEN CHILDREN HAD BEEN FAIRLY WELL BROUGHT UP BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT THEIR MOTHER HAD MANY CARES
8324-286683-0016 SO IT IS NOT STRANGE IF THEY SOMETIMES BEHAVED BADLY IN SOME OTHER FAMILIES WHERE THERE WERE ONLY NINE OR TEN BABIES ALL THE SEASON THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP MORE STRICTLY
8324-286683-0017 LIKE ALL YOUNG MUSKRATS THEY WERE FULL OF FUN AND THERE WERE FEW PLEASANTER SIGHTS THAN TO SEE THEM FROLICKING ON A WARM MOONLIGHT EVENING WHEN THEY LOOKED LIKE BROWN BALLS ROLLING AND BOUNDING AROUND ON THE SHORE OR PLUNGING INTO THE WATER
8324-286683-0018 IF THEY HAD ALL BEEN EXACTLY THE SAME AGE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN PLEASANTER FOR THE OLDEST FIVE WOULD PUT ON AIRS AND CALL THE OTHERS THE CHILDREN AND THE NEXT FIVE WOULD CALL THE YOUNGEST FIVE
8324-286683-0019 BABIES ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ALL WELL GROWN THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR THE YOUNGEST FIVE TO CALL OTHER MUSKRATS BABIES SO WHEN THEY WERE WARM AND WELL FED AND GOOD NATURED THEY LAUGHED AND SAID WHO CARES
8324-286683-0020 WHEN THEY WERE COLD AND HUNGRY THEY SLAPPED THEIR TAILS ON THE GROUND OR ON THE WATER AND SAID DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE SMART
8324-286683-0021 SHE WOULD SAY NOW CHILDREN IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY HAD TO STOP
8324-286683-0022 TEASING IS NOT SO VERY BAD YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH IT IS DREADFULLY SILLY BUT WHEN PEOPLE BEGIN BY TEASING THEY SOMETIMES GET TO SAYING THINGS IN EARNEST EVEN REALLY HATEFUL MEAN THINGS
8324-286683-0023 AND THAT WAS WHAT MADE THE MUSKRAT FATHER AND MOTHER STOP IT WHENEVER THEY COULD NOW THE WHOLE FIFTEEN CROWDED AROUND THE OLD SUMMER HOME AND SOME OF THEM WENT IN ONE WAY AND SOME OF THEM WENT IN ANOTHER
8324-286683-0024 FOR EVERY MUSKRAT'S SUMMER HOUSE HAS SEVERAL BURROWS LEADING TO IT WHEN THEY REACHED THE OLD NEST AT THE END ALL OF THEM TRIED TO GET IN AT ONCE AND THEY PUSHED EACH OTHER AROUND WITH THEIR BROAD LITTLE HEADS
8324-286683-0025 SCRAMBLED AND CLUTCHED AND HELD ON WITH THEIR STRONG LITTLE FEET FIVE OF THEM SAID IT'S OUR TURN FIRST WE'RE THE OLDEST AND FIVE MORE SAID WELL IT'S OUR TURN NEXT ANYWAY CAUSE WE'RE NEXT OLDEST
8324-286683-0026 THE OTHERS SAID YOU MIGHT GIVE UP TO US BECAUSE WE'RE THE YOUNGEST THEY PUSHED AND SCRAMBLED SOME MORE AND ONE OF THE YOUNGEST CHILDREN SAID TO ONE OF THE OLDEST WELL I DON'T CARE I'M JUST AS BIG AS YOU ARE
8324-286683-0027 WHICH WAS SO AND THE OLDER ONE ANSWERED BACK WELL YOU'RE NOT SO GOOD LOOKING WHICH WAS ALSO TRUE THEN PART OF THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS
8324-286683-0028 TOOK SIDES WITH ONE AND PART TOOK SIDES WITH THE OTHER WHAT HAD BEEN A LOVELY FROLIC BECAME AN UNPLEASANT DISGRACEFUL QUARREL AND THEY SAID SUCH THINGS AS THESE
8324-286683-0029 YOU SLAPPED YOUR TAIL ON MY BACK
8324-286683-0030 OR THE HALF WAY BETWEEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHOULD GO FIRST INTO THE OLD NEST AND IT DIDN'T MATTER A BIT WHO WAS OLDEST OR WHO WAS YOUNGEST AND IT NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THEIR DREADFUL HABIT OF TEASING
8324-286683-0031 BUT THEY WERE TOO MUCH EXCITED TO MIND AND THEY DID NOT STOP UNTIL THEIR FATHER CAME AND SLAPPED THEM WITH HIS TAIL THEN THEY KEPT STILL AND LISTENED TO THEIR MOTHER
8324-286683-0032 SHE TOLD THEM THAT THEY SHOULD LEAVE THE PLACE AT ONCE AND NOT ONE OF THEM SHOULD EVEN SET FOOT IN THE OLD NEST SUPPOSE SOMEBODY HAD GOTTEN HURT SHE SAID THIS MADE THE YOUNG MUSKRATS LOOK VERY SOBER
8324-286683-0033 FOR THEY KNEW THAT THE MUSKRAT WHO IS HURT IN WINTER NEVER GETS WELL AFTER SHE HAD LET THEM THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A WHILE SHE SAID I SHALL PUNISH YOU ALL FOR THIS
8324-286683-0034 THEN THERE WAS NO QUARREL AMONG HER CHILDREN TO SEE WHO SHOULD HAVE THE FIRST TURN NOT AT ALL ONE YOUNG MUSKRAT SAID AREN'T YOU GOING TO LET US PLAY ANY MORE YES
8324-286683-0035 BUT I SHALL CHOOSE THE GAMES THE OLDEST FIVE WILL PLAY MUD TURTLES IN WINTER THE NEXT FIVE WILL PLAY FROGS IN WINTER AND THE YOUNGEST FIVE WILL PLAY SNAKES IN WINTER
8324-286683-0036 THE WAY TO PLAY THESE GAMES IS TO LIE PERFECTLY STILL IN SOME DARK PLACE AND NOT SAY A WORD THE YOUNG MUSKRATS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER SORROWFULLY
8324-286683-0037 THEY THOUGHT IT SOUNDED VERY MUCH THE SAME AS BEING SENT TO BED FOR BEING NAUGHTY THEY DID NOT DARE SAY ANYTHING FOR THEY KNEW THAT ALTHOUGH THEIR MOTHER WAS GENTLE AS MUSKRATS ARE MOST OF THE TIME SHE COULD BE VERY SEVERE
8324-286683-0038 SO THEY WENT AWAY QUIETLY TO PLAY WHAT SHE HAD TOLD THEM THEY MUST BUT IT WAS NOT MUCH FUN TO PLAY THOSE GAMES WHEN ALL THE OTHERS WERE HAVING A FINE TIME IN THE SUNSHINE
839-130898-0000 IN LATITUDE FORTY SEVEN DEGREES
839-130898-0001 AND LONGITUDE SEVENTEEN DEGREES
839-130898-0002 IN THE AFTERMATH OF THIS STORM WE WERE THROWN BACK TO THE EAST AWAY WENT ANY HOPE OF ESCAPING TO THE LANDING PLACES OF NEW YORK OR THE SAINT LAWRENCE IN DESPAIR
839-130898-0003 POOR NED WENT INTO SECLUSION LIKE CAPTAIN NEMO CONSEIL AND I NO LONGER LEFT EACH OTHER AS I SAID THE NAUTILUS VEERED TO THE EAST TO BE MORE ACCURATE I SHOULD HAVE SAID TO THE NORTHEAST
839-130898-0004 SOMETIMES BENEATH THEM THE SHIP WANDERED FOR DAYS AMID THESE MISTS SO FEARED BY NAVIGATORS THESE ARE CAUSED CHIEFLY BY MELTING ICE WHICH KEEPS THE AIR EXTREMELY DAMP
839-130898-0005 HOW MANY SHIPS HAVE PERISHED IN THESE WATERWAYS AS THEY TRIED TO GET DIRECTIONS FROM THE HAZY LIGHTS ON THE COAST HOW MANY CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THESE OPAQUE MISTS HOW MANY COLLISIONS HAVE OCCURRED WITH THESE REEFS
839-130898-0006 WHERE THE BREAKING SURF IS COVERED BY THE NOISE OF THE WIND HOW MANY VESSELS HAVE RAMMED EACH OTHER
839-130898-0007 SO THE FLOOR OF THIS SEA HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A BATTLEFIELD WHERE EVERY SHIP DEFEATED
839-130898-0008 OTHERS NEWER AND REFLECTING OUR BEACON LIGHT ON THEIR IRONWORK AND COPPER UNDERSIDES AMONG THESE VESSELS HOW MANY WENT DOWN WITH ALL HANDS WITH THEIR CREWS AND HOSTS OF IMMIGRANTS
839-130898-0009 AT THESE TROUBLE SPOTS SO PROMINENT IN THE STATISTICS CAPE RACE SAINT PAUL ISLAND THE STRAIT OF BELLE ISLE THE SAINT LAWRENCE ESTUARY
839-130898-0010 AND IN ONLY A FEW YEARS HOW MANY VICTIMS HAVE BEEN FURNISHED TO THE OBITUARY NOTICES BY THE ROYAL MAIL INMAN AND MONTREAL LINES BY VESSELS NAMED THE SOLWAY THE ISIS THE PARAMATTA
839-130898-0011 THE HUNGARIAN THE CANADIAN THE ANGLO SAXON THE HUMBOLDT
839-130898-0012 ALL RUN AGROUND BY THE ARCTIC AND THE LYONNAIS SUNK IN COLLISIONS BY THE PRESIDENT THE PACIFIC AND THE CITY OF GLASGOW
839-130898-0013 OF THEIR GLOOMY RUBBLE THE NAUTILUS NAVIGATED
839-130898-0014 BY MAY FIFTEENTH WE WERE OFF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF THE GRAND BANKS OF NEWFOUNDLAND THESE BANKS ARE THE RESULT OF MARINE SEDIMENTATION AN EXTENSIVE ACCUMULATION OF ORGANIC WASTE
839-130898-0015 BROUGHT EITHER FROM THE EQUATOR BY THE GULF STREAM'S CURRENT OR FROM THE NORTH POLE BY THE COUNTERCURRENT OF COLD WATER THAT SKIRTS THE AMERICAN COAST HERE TOO ERRATICALLY DRIFTING CHUNKS COLLECT FROM THE ICE BREAKUP
839-130898-0016 HERE A HUGE BONEYARD FORMS FROM FISH MOLLUSKS
839-130898-0017 DYING OVER IT BY THE BILLIONS THE SEA IS OF NO GREAT DEPTH AT THE GRAND BANKS A FEW HUNDRED FATHOMS AT BEST BUT TO THE SOUTH THERE IS A DEEP
839-130898-0018 SUDDENLY OCCURRING DEPRESSION A THREE THOUSAND METER PIT HERE THE GULF STREAM WIDENS
839-130898-0019 A ONE METER LUMPFISH BLACKISH ON TOP
839-130898-0020 AND RARE AMONG ITS BRETHREN IN THAT IT PRACTICES MONOGAMY A GOOD SIZED EELPOUT A TYPE OF EMERALD MORAY WHOSE FLAVOR IS EXCELLENT WOLFFISH WITH BIG EYES
839-130898-0021 VIVIPAROUS BLENNIES WHOSE EGGS HATCH INSIDE THEIR BODIES LIKE THOSE OF SNAKES BLOATED GOBIO
839-130898-0022 MEASURING TWO DECIMETERS GRENADIERS WITH LONG TAILS AND GLEAMING WITH A SILVERY GLOW SPEEDY FISH VENTURING FAR FROM THEIR HIGH ARCTIC SEAS OUR NETS ALSO HAULED IN A BOLD
839-130898-0023 DARING VIGOROUS AND MUSCULAR FISH ARMED WITH PRICKLES ON ITS HEAD AND STINGS ON ITS FINS A REAL SCORPION MEASURING TWO TO THREE METERS THE RUTHLESS ENEMY
839-130898-0024 BLENNIES AND SALMON IT WAS THE BULLHEAD OF THE NORTHERLY SEAS A FISH WITH RED FINS AND A BROWN BODY COVERED WITH NODULES
839-130898-0025 THE NAUTILUS'S FISHERMEN HAD SOME TROUBLE GETTING A GRIP ON THIS ANIMAL WHICH THANKS TO THE FORMATION OF ITS GILL COVERS
839-130898-0026 CAN PROTECT ITS RESPIRATORY ORGANS FROM ANY PARCHING CONTACT WITH THE AIR AND CAN LIVE OUT OF WATER FOR A GOOD WHILE AND I'LL MENTION FOR THE RECORD SOME LITTLE BANDED BLENNIES
839-130898-0027 THAT FOLLOW SHIPS INTO THE NORTHERNMOST SEAS SHARP SNOUTED CARP EXCLUSIVE TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC SCORPIONFISH AND LASTLY
839-130898-0028 CHIEFLY THE COD SPECIES WHICH I DETECTED IN THEIR WATERS OF CHOICE OVER THESE INEXHAUSTIBLE GRAND BANKS BECAUSE NEWFOUNDLAND IS SIMPLY AN UNDERWATER PEAK
839-130898-0029 YOU COULD CALL THESE COD MOUNTAIN FISH WHILE THE NAUTILUS WAS CLEARING A PATH THROUGH THEIR TIGHT RANKS
839-130898-0030 MERCY LOOK AT THESE COD HE SAID WHY I THOUGHT COD WERE FLAT LIKE DAB OR SOLE
839-130898-0031 AND SPREAD OUT ON DISPLAY BUT IN THE WATER THEY'RE LIKE MULLET SPINDLE SHAPED AND PERFECTLY BUILT FOR SPEED I CAN EASILY BELIEVE MASTER CONSEIL REPLIED BUT WHAT CROWDS OF THEM WHAT SWARMS
839-130898-0032 BAH MY FRIEND THERE'D BE MANY MORE WITHOUT THEIR ENEMIES SCORPIONFISH AND HUMAN BEINGS DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY EGGS HAVE BEEN COUNTED IN A SINGLE FEMALE I'LL GO ALL OUT CONSEIL REPLIED
839-130898-0033 FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ELEVEN MILLION MY FRIEND ELEVEN MILLION I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THAT UNTIL I COUNT THEM MYSELF SO COUNT THEM CONSEIL
839-130898-0034 BUT IT WOULD BE LESS WORK TO BELIEVE ME BESIDES FRENCHMEN ENGLISHMEN AMERICANS DANES AND NORWEGIANS CATCH THESE COD BY THE THOUSANDS THEY'RE EATEN IN PRODIGIOUS QUANTITIES AND WITHOUT
839-130898-0035 THE SEAS WOULD SOON BE DEPOPULATED OF THEM ACCORDINGLY IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA ALONE FIVE THOUSAND SHIPS MANNED BY SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND SEAMEN GO AFTER COD EACH SHIP BRINGS BACK AN AVERAGE CATCH
839-130898-0036 OF FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FISH MAKING TWENTY TWO MILLION OFF THE COAST OF NORWAY
839-130898-0037 THE TOTAL IS THE SAME FINE CONSEIL REPLIED I'LL TAKE MASTER'S WORD FOR IT I WON'T COUNT THEM COUNT WHAT THOSE ELEVEN MILLION EGGS BUT I'LL MAKE ONE COMMENT
839-130898-0038 WHAT'S THAT IF ALL THEIR EGGS HATCHED JUST FOUR CODFISH COULD FEED ENGLAND AMERICA AND NORWAY AS WE SKIMMED THE DEPTHS OF THE GRAND BANKS
839-130898-0039 I COULD SEE PERFECTLY THOSE LONG FISHING LINES EACH ARMED WITH TWO HUNDRED HOOKS THAT EVERY BOAT DANGLED BY THE DOZENS THE LOWER END OF EACH LINE DRAGGED THE BOTTOM BY MEANS OF A SMALL GRAPPLING IRON
839-130898-0040 OF A CORK FLOAT THE NAUTILUS HAD TO MANEUVER SHREWDLY IN THE MIDST OF THIS UNDERWATER SPIDERWEB BUT THE SHIP DIDN'T STAY LONG IN THESE HEAVILY TRAVELED WATERWAYS IT WENT UP TO ABOUT LATITUDE FORTY TWO DEGREES
839-130898-0041 THIS BROUGHT IT ABREAST OF SAINT JOHN'S IN NEWFOUNDLAND AND HEART'S CONTENT WHERE THE ATLANTIC CABLE REACHES ITS END POINT INSTEAD OF CONTINUING NORTH THE NAUTILUS TOOK AN EASTERLY HEADING
839-130898-0042 AS IF TO GO ALONG THIS PLATEAU ON WHICH THE TELEGRAPH CABLE RESTS WHERE MULTIPLE SOUNDINGS HAVE GIVEN THE CONTOURS OF THE TERRAIN WITH THE UTMOST ACCURACY IT WAS ON MAY SEVENTEENTH
839-130898-0043 ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILES FROM HEART'S CONTENT
839-130898-0044 THAT I SPOTTED THIS CABLE LYING ON THE SEAFLOOR CONSEIL WHOM I HADN'T ALERTED MISTOOK IT AT FIRST FOR A GIGANTIC SEA SNAKE AND WAS GEARING UP TO CLASSIFY IT IN HIS BEST MANNER
839-130898-0045 THE FINE LAD AND LET HIM DOWN GENTLY BY GIVING HIM VARIOUS DETAILS ON THE LAYING OF THIS CABLE THE FIRST CABLE WAS PUT DOWN DURING THE YEARS EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT BUT
839-130898-0046 AFTER TRANSMITTING ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED TELEGRAMS IT WENT DEAD IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE ENGINEERS BUILT A NEW CABLE THAT MEASURED
839-130898-0047 FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED METRIC TONS AND WAS SHIPPED ABOARD THE GREAT EASTERN THIS ATTEMPT ALSO FAILED NOW THEN
839-130898-0048 ON MAY TWENTY FIFTH WHILE SUBMERGED TO A DEPTH OF THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SIX METERS THE NAUTILUS LAY IN PRECISELY THE LOCALITY WHERE THIS SECOND CABLE SUFFERED THE RUPTURE THAT RUINED THE UNDERTAKING
839-130898-0049 THE ELECTRICIANS ON BOARD DECIDED TO CUT THE CABLE BEFORE FISHING IT UP AND BY ELEVEN O'CLOCK THAT EVENING THEY HAD RETRIEVED THE DAMAGED PART THEY REPAIRED THE JOINT AND ITS SPLICE
839-130898-0050 THEN THE CABLE WAS RESUBMERGED BUT A FEW DAYS LATER IT SNAPPED AGAIN AND COULDN'T BE RECOVERED FROM THE OCEAN DEPTHS
839-130898-0051 WHO HAD RISKED HIS WHOLE FORTUNE TO PROMOTE THIS UNDERTAKING CALLED FOR A NEW BOND ISSUE IT SOLD OUT IMMEDIATELY
839-130898-0052 WHICH WAS PROTECTED BY A PADDING OF TEXTILE MATERIAL ENCLOSED IN A METAL SHEATH THE GREAT EASTERN PUT BACK TO SEA ON JULY THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX
839-130898-0053 YET THERE WAS ONE HITCH AS THEY GRADUALLY UNROLLED THIS THIRD CABLE THE ELECTRICIANS OBSERVED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THAT SOMEONE HAD RECENTLY DRIVEN NAILS INTO IT TRYING TO DAMAGE ITS CORE
839-130898-0054 CAPTAIN ANDERSON HIS OFFICERS AND THE ENGINEERS PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER THEN POSTED A WARNING
839-130898-0055 WITHOUT A TRIAL AFTER THAT THESE VILLAINOUS ATTEMPTS WERE NOT REPEATED BY JULY TWENTY THIRD THE GREAT EASTERN WAS LYING NO FARTHER THAN EIGHT HUNDRED KILOMETERS FROM NEWFOUNDLAND
839-130898-0056 WHEN IT RECEIVED TELEGRAPHED NEWS FROM IRELAND
839-130898-0057 SIGNED BETWEEN PRUSSIA AND AUSTRIA AFTER THE BATTLE OF SADOVA THROUGH THE MISTS ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH IT SIGHTED THE PORT OF HEART'S CONTENT
839-130898-0058 HAD ENDED HAPPILY AND IN ITS FIRST DISPATCH YOUNG AMERICA ADDRESSED OLD EUROPE WITH THESE WISE WORDS SO RARELY UNDERSTOOD GLORY TO GOD IN THE HIGHEST AND PEACE ON EARTH TO MEN OF GOOD WILL
839-130898-0059 I DIDN'T EXPECT TO FIND THIS ELECTRIC CABLE IN MINT CONDITION AS IT LOOKED ON LEAVING ITS PLACE OF MANUFACTURE THE LONG SNAKE WAS COVERED WITH SEASHELL RUBBLE AND BRISTLING WITH
839-130898-0060 A CRUST OF CAKED GRAVEL PROTECTED IT FROM ANY MOLLUSKS THAT MIGHT BORE INTO IT IT RESTED SERENELY SHELTERED FROM THE SEA'S MOTIONS UNDER A PRESSURE FAVORABLE TO THE TRANSMISSION
839-130898-0061 THAT GOES FROM AMERICA TO EUROPE
839-130898-0062 THIS CABLE WILL NO DOUBT LAST INDEFINITELY BECAUSE AS OBSERVERS NOTE
839-130898-0063 BESIDES ON THIS WELL CHOSEN PLATEAU THE CABLE NEVER LIES AT DEPTHS THAT COULD CAUSE A BREAK THE NAUTILUS
839-130898-0064 TO ITS LOWEST REACHES LOCATED FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY ONE METERS DOWN
839-130898-0065 THEN WE RETURNED TO THE LOCALITY WHERE THE EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE ACCIDENT HAD TAKEN PLACE THERE THE OCEAN FLOOR FORMED A VALLEY
839-130898-0066 ONE HUNDRED TWENTY KILOMETERS WIDE INTO WHICH YOU COULD FIT MT BLANC WITHOUT ITS SUMMIT POKING ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES THIS VALLEY IS CLOSED OFF TO THE EAST BY A SHEER WALL
839-130898-0067 TWO THOUSAND METERS HIGH WE ARRIVED THERE ON MAY TWENTY EIGHTH AND THE NAUTILUS
839-130898-0068 HEAD UP NORTH AND BEACH US ON THE BRITISH ISLES NO MUCH TO MY SURPRISE HE WENT BACK DOWN SOUTH AND RETURNED TO EUROPEAN SEAS AS WE SWUNG AROUND THE EMERALD ISLE
839-130898-0069 I SPOTTED CAPE CLEAR FOR AN INSTANT PLUS THE LIGHTHOUSE ON FASTNET ROCK THAT GUIDES ALL THOSE THOUSANDS OF SHIPS SETTING OUT FROM GLASGOW OR LIVERPOOL AN IMPORTANT QUESTION THEN POPPED INTO MY HEAD
839-130898-0070 WOULD THE NAUTILUS DARE TO TACKLE THE ENGLISH CHANNEL NED LAND WHO PROMPTLY REAPPEARED AFTER WE HUGGED SHORE NEVER STOPPED QUESTIONING ME WHAT COULD I ANSWER HIM
839-130898-0071 AFTER GIVING THE CANADIAN A GLIMPSE OF AMERICAN SHORES WAS HE ABOUT TO SHOW ME THE COAST OF FRANCE BUT THE NAUTILUS KEPT GRAVITATING SOUTHWARD ON MAY THIRTIETH
839-130898-0072 IN SIGHT OF LAND'S END IT PASSED BETWEEN THE LOWERMOST TIP OF ENGLAND AND THE SCILLY ISLANDS WHICH IT LEFT BEHIND TO STARBOARD IF IT WAS GOING TO ENTER THE ENGLISH CHANNEL
839-130898-0073 IT CLEARLY NEEDED TO HEAD EAST IT DID NOT ALL DAY LONG ON MAY THIRTY FIRST THE NAUTILUS SWEPT AROUND THE SEA IN A SERIES OF CIRCLES
839-130898-0074 THAT HAD ME DEEPLY PUZZLED IT SEEMED TO BE SEARCHING FOR A LOCALITY THAT IT HAD SOME TROUBLE FINDING AT NOON
839-130898-0075 HE DIDN'T ADDRESS A WORD TO ME HE LOOKED GLOOMIER THAN EVER WHAT WAS FILLING HIM WITH SUCH SADNESS WAS IT OUR PROXIMITY TO THESE EUROPEAN SHORES WAS HE RELIVING HIS MEMORIES OF THAT COUNTRY
839-130898-0076 HE HAD LEFT BEHIND IF SO WHAT DID HE FEEL REMORSE OR REGRET FOR A GOOD WHILE THESE THOUGHTS OCCUPIED MY MIND AND I HAD A HUNCH THAT FATE WOULD SOON GIVE AWAY THE CAPTAIN'S SECRETS
839-130898-0077 THE NEXT DAY JUNE FIRST THE NAUTILUS KEPT TO THE SAME TACK IT WAS OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO LOCATE SOME PRECISE SPOT IN THE OCEAN JUST AS ON THE DAY BEFORE
839-130898-0078 CAPTAIN NEMO CAME TO TAKE THE ALTITUDE OF THE SUN THE SEA WAS SMOOTH THE SKIES CLEAR EIGHT MILES TO THE EAST A BIG STEAMSHIP WAS VISIBLE ON THE HORIZON LINE NO FLAG
839-130898-0079 WAS FLAPPING FROM THE GAFF OF ITS FORE AND AFT SAIL AND I COULDN'T TELL ITS NATIONALITY A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE SUN PASSED ITS ZENITH
839-130898-0080 AND TOOK HIS SIGHTS WITH THE UTMOST PRECISION THE ABSOLUTE CALM OF THE WAVES FACILITATED THIS OPERATION THE NAUTILUS LAY MOTIONLESS NEITHER ROLLING NOR PITCHING I WAS ON THE PLATFORM JUST THEN
839-130898-0081 AFTER DETERMINING OUR POSITION THE CAPTAIN PRONOUNCED ONLY THESE WORDS IT'S RIGHT HERE HE WENT DOWN THE HATCH HAD HE SEEN THAT VESSEL CHANGE COURSE
839-130898-0082 AND SEEMINGLY HEAD TOWARD US I'M UNABLE TO SAY I RETURNED TO THE LOUNGE THE HATCH CLOSED AND I HEARD WATER HISSING IN THE BALLAST TANKS THE NAUTILUS BEGAN TO SINK
839-130898-0083 ON A VERTICAL LINE BECAUSE ITS PROPELLER WAS IN CHECK AND NO LONGER FURNISHED ANY FORWARD MOTION SOME MINUTES LATER IT STOPPED AT A DEPTH OF EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY THREE METERS AND CAME TO REST ON THE SEAFLOOR
839-130898-0084 THE CEILING LIGHTS IN THE LOUNGE THEN WENT OUT THE PANELS OPENED AND THROUGH THE WINDOWS I SAW FOR A HALF MILE RADIUS THE SEA BRIGHTLY LIT BY THE BEACON'S RAYS
839-130898-0085 I LOOKED TO PORT AND SAW NOTHING BUT THE IMMENSENESS OF THESE TRANQUIL WATERS TO STARBOARD A PROMINENT BULGE ON THE SEA BOTTOM CAUGHT MY ATTENTION YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
839-130898-0086 IT WAS SOME RUIN ENSHROUDED IN A CRUST OF WHITENED SEASHELLS AS IF UNDER A MANTLE OF SNOW CAREFULLY EXAMINING THIS MASS I COULD IDENTIFY THE SWOLLEN OUTLINES OF A SHIP SHORN
839-130898-0087 OF ITS MASTS WHICH MUST HAVE SUNK BOW FIRST THIS CASUALTY CERTAINLY DATED FROM SOME FAR OFF TIME TO BE SO CAKED WITH THE LIMESTONE OF THESE WATERS
839-130898-0088 THIS WRECKAGE MUST HAVE SPENT MANY A YEAR ON THE OCEAN FLOOR WHAT SHIP WAS THIS WHY HAD THE NAUTILUS COME TO VISIT ITS GRAVE WAS IT SOMETHING OTHER THAN A MARITIME ACCIDENT THAT HAD DRAGGED THIS CRAFT UNDER THE WATERS
839-130898-0089 I WASN'T SURE WHAT TO THINK BUT NEXT TO ME I HEARD CAPTAIN NEMO'S VOICE SLOWLY SAY ORIGINALLY THIS SHIP WAS CHRISTENED
839-130898-0090 IT CARRIED SEVENTY FOUR CANNONS AND WAS LAUNCHED IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY TWO ON AUGUST THIRTEENTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT COMMANDED BY LA POYPE VERTRIEUX
839-130898-0091 IT FOUGHT VALIANTLY AGAINST THE PRESTON ON JULY FOURTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE AS A MEMBER OF THE SQUADRON UNDER ADMIRAL D'ESTAING IT ASSISTED IN THE CAPTURE
839-130898-0092 OF THE ISLAND OF GRENADA ON SEPTEMBER FIFTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY ONE UNDER THE COUNT DE GRASSE IT TOOK PART IN THE BATTLE OF CHESAPEAKE BAY IN SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR
839-130898-0093 THE NEW REPUBLIC OF FRANCE CHANGED THE NAME OF THIS SHIP ON APRIL SIXTEENTH OF THAT SAME YEAR IT JOINED THE SQUADRON AT BREST UNDER REAR ADMIRAL
839-130898-0094 WHO WAS ENTRUSTED WITH ESCORTING A CONVOY OF WHEAT COMING FROM AMERICA UNDER THE COMMAND OF ADMIRAL VAN STABEL IN THIS SECOND YEAR OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONARY CALENDAR
839-130898-0095 THIS SQUADRON FOUGHT AN ENCOUNTER WITH ENGLISH VESSELS SIR TODAY IS JUNE FIRST EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT OR THE THIRTEENTH DAY IN THE MONTH OF PASTURE
839-130898-0096 SEVENTY FOUR YEARS AGO TO THE DAY AT THIS VERY SPOT IN LATITUDE
839-130898-0097 AND LONGITUDE SEVENTEEN DEGREES
839-130898-0098 ITS THREE MASTS GONE WATER IN ITS HOLD A THIRD OF ITS CREW OUT OF ACTION IT PREFERRED TO GO TO THE BOTTOM WITH ITS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX SEAMEN RATHER THAN SURRENDER AND WITH ITS FLAG
839-130898-0099 NAILED UP ON THE AFTERDECK IT DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE WAVES TO SHOUTS OF LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC THIS IS THE AVENGER I EXCLAIMED YES SIR THE AVENGER A SPLENDID NAME
8580-287363-0000 RAPIDLY THE AIRSHIP ASCENDED AND WHEN IT WAS HIGH OVER THE TOWN OF SHOPTON TOM HEADED THE CRAFT DUE WEST LOOKING DOWN HE TRIED TO DESCRY MARY NESTOR IN HER CARRIAGE BUT THE TREES WERE IN THE WAY
8580-287363-0001 THEIR INTERLOCKING BRANCHES HIDING THE GIRL TOM DID SEE CROWDS OF OTHER PERSONS THOUGH THRONGING THE STREETS OF SHOPTON FOR THOUGH THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD MADE MANY FLIGHTS THERE WAS ALWAYS A NOVELTY ABOUT THEM THAT BROUGHT OUT THE CURIOUS
8580-287363-0002 COMPLIMENTED MISTER PARKER IS IT ALWAYS AS EASY AS THIS STARTING ALWAYS IS WAS THE ANSWER THOUGH AS THE IRISHMAN SAID COMING DOWN ISN'T SOMETIMES QUITE SO COMFORTABLE BLESS MY GIZZARD THAT'S SO
8580-287363-0003 CRIED THE ECCENTRIC MISTER DAMON CAN WE VOL PLANE TO EARTH IN THE RED CLOUD TOM YES BUT NOT AS EASILY AS IN THE BUTTERFLY HOWEVER I HOPE WE WILL NOT HAVE TO
8580-287363-0004 NOW MISTER DAMON IF YOU WILL JUST TAKE CHARGE OF THE STEERING APPARATUS FOR A MINUTE I WANT TO GO AFT WHAT FOR I WISH TO SEE IF EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY ERADICATE WAS MAKING THOSE QUEER MOTIONS
8580-287363-0005 MISTER DAMON WHO KNEW HOW TO OPERATE THE RED CLOUD WAS SOON GUIDING HER ON THE COURSE WHILE TOM MADE HIS WAY TO THE REAR COMPARTMENTS THROUGH THE MOTOR ROOM WHERE THE STORES OF SUPPLIES AND FOOD WERE KEPT HE MADE A CAREFUL EXAMINATION
8580-287363-0006 LOOKING FROM AN AFTER WINDOW AND EVEN GOING OUT ON A SMALL OPEN PLATFORM BUT COULD DISCOVER NOTHING WRONG I GUESS RAD WAS JUST CAPERING ABOUT WITHOUT ANY SPECIAL OBJECT MUSED TOM
8580-287363-0007 THAT THE COLORED MAN HAD HAD A METHOD IN HIS MADNESS ON HIS WAY BACK THROUGH THE MOTOR ROOM TOM LOOKED TO THE MACHINERY AND ADJUSTED SOME OF THE AUXILIARY OIL FEEDERS THE VARIOUS PIECES OF APPARATUS WERE WORKING WELL
8580-287363-0008 THOUGH THE ENGINE HAD NOT YET BEEN SPEEDED UP TO ITS LIMIT TOM WANTED IT TO WARM UP FIRST EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT ASKED MISTER DAMON AS TOM REJOINED THEM IN THE PILOT HOUSE WHICH WAS JUST FORWARD OF THE LIVING ROOM IN THE MAIN CABIN
8580-287363-0009 YES I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT MADE RAD ACT THAT WAY BUT I'LL SET THE AUTOMATIC STEERING GEAR NOW MISTER DAMON AND THEN YOU WILL BE RELIEVED MISTER JENKS WAS GAZING OFF TOWARD THE WEST
8580-287363-0010 TO WHERE HE HOPED TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF PHANTOM MOUNTAIN HOW DO YOU LIKE IT ASKED TOM IT'S GREAT REPLIED THE DIAMOND MAN I'VE NEVER BEEN IN AN AIRSHIP BEFORE AND IT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I EXPECTED BUT IT'S GREAT
8580-287363-0011 IT'S THE ONLY CRAFT THAT WILL SERVE OUR PURPOSE AMONG THE TOWERING MOUNTAIN PEAKS WHERE THE DIAMOND MAKERS ARE HIDDEN I HOPE WE CAN FIND THEM IN A LITTLE WHILE THE RED CLOUD WAS SKIMMING ALONG AT FASTER SPEED
8580-287363-0012 GUIDED BY THE AUTOMATIC RUDDERS SO THAT NO ONE WAS NEEDED IN THE PILOT HOUSE SINCE THERE WAS NO DANGER OF COLLISIONS AIRSHIPS ARE NOT QUITE NUMEROUS ENOUGH FOR THAT YET THOUGH THEY MAY SOON BECOME SO
8580-287363-0013 TOM AND THE OTHERS DEVOTED SEVERAL HOURS TO ARRANGING THEIR STATEROOMS AND BUNKS AND GETTING THEIR CLOTHING STOWED AWAY AND WHEN THIS WAS DONE MISTER PARKER AND MISTER JENKS SAT GAZING OFF INTO SPACE IT'S HARD TO REALIZE THAT WE ARE REALLY IN AN AIRSHIP
8580-287363-0014 OBSERVED THE DIAMOND MAN AT FIRST I THOUGHT I WOULD BE FRIGHTENED BUT I'M NOT A BIT IT DOESN'T SEEM AS IF ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN SOMETHING IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN SOON SAID MISTER PARKER SUDDENLY
8580-287363-0015 AS HE GAZED AT SOME WEATHER INSTRUMENTS ON THE CABIN WALL BLESS MY SOUL DON'T SAY THAT CRIED MISTER DAMON WHAT IS IT I THINK FROM MY OBSERVATIONS THAT WE WILL SOON HAVE A HURRICANE SAID THE SCIENTIFIC MAN
8580-287363-0016 THERE IS EVERY INDICATION OF IT AND HE SEEMED QUITE DELIGHTED AT THE PROSPECT OF HIS PREDICTION COMING TRUE A HURRICANE CRIED MISTER DAMON I HOPE IT ISN'T LIKE THE ONE THAT BLEW US TO EARTHQUAKE ISLAND
8580-287363-0017 OH I THINK THERE WILL BE NO DANGER SPOKE TOM IF IT COMES ON TO BLOW WE WILL ASCEND OR DESCEND OUT OF THE PATH OF THE STORM THIS CRAFT IS NOT LIKE THE ILL FATED WHIZZER I CAN MORE EASILY HANDLE THE RED CLOUD EVEN IN A BAD STORM
8580-287363-0018 REMARKED MISTER JENKS IT WOULD BE TOO BAD TO BE WRECKED BEFORE WE GOT TO PHANTOM MOUNTAIN WELL I PREDICT THAT WE WILL HAVE A BAD STORM INSISTED MISTER PARKER
8580-287363-0019 AND TOM COULD NOT HELP WISHING THAT THE SCIENTIST WOULD KEEP HIS GLOOMY FOREBODINGS TO HIMSELF HOWEVER THE STORM HAD NOT DEVELOPED UP TO NOON WHEN TOM WITH MISTER DAMON'S HELP SERVED A FINE MEAL IN THE DINING ROOM IN THE AFTERNOON THE SPEED OF THE SHIP WAS INCREASED
8580-287363-0020 AND BY NIGHT THEY HAD COVERED SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES THROUGH THE DARKNESS THE RED CLOUD KEPT ON MAKING GOOD TIME TOM GOT UP OCCASIONALLY TO LOOK TO THE MACHINERY
8580-287363-0021 AND AN ALARM BELL WOULD SOUND IN HIS STATEROOM WHEN ANYTHING WENT WRONG BLESS MY NAPKIN EXCLAIMED MISTER DAMON THE NEXT MORNING AS THEY SAT DOWN TO A BREAKFAST OF FRUIT HAM AND EGGS AND FRAGRANT COFFEE
8580-287363-0022 AND YET WE ARE HOW FAR ARE WE ABOVE THE EARTH TOM HE ASKED TURNING TO THE YOUNG INVENTOR ABOUT TWO MILES NOW I JUST SENT HER UP AS I THOUGHT I DETECTED THAT STORM MISTER PARKER SPOKE OF I TOLD YOU IT WOULD COME DECLARED THE SCIENTIST
8580-287363-0023 THAT MORNING BUT ONLY THE LOWER EDGE OF IT CAUGHT THE RED CLOUD AND WHEN TOM SENT HER UP STILL HIGHER SHE FOUND A COMPARATIVELY QUIET ZONE WHERE SHE SLID ALONG AT GOOD SPEED
8580-287363-0024 THAT AFTERNOON TOM BUSIED HIMSELF ABOUT SOME WIRES AND A NUMBER OF COMPLICATED PIECES OF APPARATUS WHICH WERE IN ONE CORNER OF THE MAIN CABIN WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW ASKED MISTER JENKS WHO HAD BEEN TALKING WITH MISTER PARKER
8580-287363-0025 AND SHOWING THAT SCIENTIST SOME OF THE MANUFACTURED DIAMONDS GETTING OUR WIRELESS APPARATUS IN SHAPE ANSWERED THE LAD I SHOULD HAVE DONE IT BEFORE BUT I HAD SO MUCH TO DO THAT I COULDN'T GET AT IT
8580-287363-0026 DAD WILL WANT TO KNOW HOW WE ARE DOING AS HE WORKED AWAY HE ALSO MADE UP HIS MIND TO SEND ANOTHER MESSAGE IN CARE OF HIS FATHER FOR THERE WAS A RECEIVING STATION IN THE SWIFT HOME AND TO WHOM THIS MESSAGE WAS ADDRESSED TOM DID NOT SAY
8580-287363-0027 BUT WE FANCY SOME OF OUR READERS CAN GUESS FINALLY AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF WORK THE WIRELESS WAS IN SHAPE TO SEND AND RECEIVE MESSAGES TOM PULLED OVER THE LEVER AND A CRACKLING SOUND WAS HEARD
8580-287363-0028 AS THE ELECTRICITY LEAPED FROM THE TRANSMITTERS INTO SPACE THEN HE CLAMPED THE RECEIVER ON HIS EAR ALL READY HE ANNOUNCED HAS ANYBODY ANY MESSAGES THEY WISH SENT FOR WITH THE COURTESY OF A TRUE HOST
8580-287363-0029 HE WAS READY TO SERVE HIS GUESTS BEFORE HE FORWARDED HIS OWN WIRELESS NOTES JUST TELL MY WIFE THAT I'M ENJOYING MYSELF REQUESTED MISTER DAMON BLESS MY FOOTSTOOL BUT THIS IS GREAT WE'RE OFF THE EARTH YET
8580-287363-0030 CONNECTED WITH IT MISTER JENKS HAD NO ONE TO WHOM HE WANTED TO SEND ANY WORD BUT MISTER PARKER WISH TO WIRE TO A FELLOW SCIENTIST THE RESULT OF SOME OBSERVATIONS MADE IN THE UPPER AIR TOM NOTED ALL THE MESSAGES DOWN
8580-287363-0031 AND THEN WHEN ALL WAS IN READINESS HE BEGAN TO CALL HIS HOME STATION HE KNEW THAT EITHER HIS FATHER OR MISTER JACKSON THE ENGINEER COULD RECEIVE THE WIRELESS
8580-287363-0032 BUT NO SOONER HAD THE YOUNG INVENTOR SENT OFF THE FIRST FEW DOTS AND DASHES REPRESENTING S I HIS HOME STATION CALL THAN HE STARTED AND A LOOK OF SURPRISE CAME OVER HIS FACE THEY'RE CALLING US HE EXCLAIMED WHO IS
8580-287363-0033 ASKED MISTER JENKS MY HOUSE MY FATHER HE HE'S BEEN TRYING TO GET US EVER SINCE WE STARTED BUT I DIDN'T HAVE THE WIRELESS IN SHAPE TO RECEIVE MESSAGES OH I HOPE IT'S NOT TOO LATE TOO LATE BLESS MY SOUL TOO LATE FOR WHAT
8580-287363-0034 GASPED MISTER DAMON SOMEWHAT ALARMED BY TOM'S MANNER THE LAD DID NOT ANSWER AT ONCE HE WAS INTENTLY LISTENING TO A SERIES OF DOTS AND DASHES THAT CLICKED IN THE TELEPHONE RECEIVER CLAMPED TO HIS LEFT EAR ON HIS FACE
8580-287363-0035 THERE WAS A LOOK OF WORRIMENT FATHER HAS JUST SENT ME A MESSAGE HE SAID IT'S A WARNING FLASHED THROUGH SPACE HE'S BEEN TRYING TO GET IT TO ME SINCE YESTERDAY
8580-287363-0036 ASKED MISTER JENKS RISING FROM HIS SEAT THE MYSTERIOUS MAN IS ABOARD THE AIRSHIP HIDDEN AWAY CRIED TOM THAT'S WHAT ERADICATE WAS TRYING TO CALL TO OUR ATTENTION AS WE STARTED OFF
8580-287364-0000 CHAPTER TEN DROPPING THE STOWAWAY TOM'S EXCITED ANNOUNCEMENT STARTLED MISTER DAMON AND THE OTHERS AS MUCH AS IF THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD INFORMED THEM THAT THE AIRSHIP HAD EXPLODED
8580-287364-0001 AND WAS ABOUT TO DASH WITH THEM TO THE EARTH THE MEN LEAPED TO THEIR FEET AND STARED AT THE LAD A STOWAWAY ON BOARD CRIED MISTER DAMON BLESS MY SOUL HOW DID HE ARE YOU SURE THAT MESSAGE IS STRAIGHT ASKED MISTER JENKS
8580-287364-0002 DID ERADICATE SEE THE MAN HE SAYS HE DID ANSWERED TOM THE MAN IS HIDDEN AWAY ON BOARD NOW PROBABLY AMONG THE STORES AND SUPPLIES BLESS MY TOMATO SAUCE EXPLODED MISTER DAMON
8580-287364-0003 WE MUST GET HIM OUT AT ONCE DECLARED MISTER JENKS I KNEW SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN ON THIS VOYAGE CAME FROM MISTER PARKER I PREDICTED IT FROM THE FIRST TOM THOUGHT CONSIDERABLE
8580-287364-0004 BUT HE DID NOT ANSWER THE SCIENTIST JUST THEN ANOTHER COMMUNICATION WAS COMING TO HIM BY WIRELESS HE LISTENED INTENTLY FATHER SAYS THE LAD TOLD HIS COMPANIONS THAT ERADICATE ONLY HAD A GLIMPSE OF THE MAN AT THE LAST MOMENT
8580-287364-0005 HE WAS LOOKING FROM THE REAR STOREROOM WINDOW HE'S THE SAME MAN WHO CALLED ON ME THAT TIME RAD REMEMBERS HIM VERY WELL BLESS MY SHOES WHAT'S TO BE DONE INQUIRED MISTER DAMON LOOKING AROUND HELPLESSLY
8580-287364-0006 DECIDED MISTER JENKS WITH VIGOR GET HIM OUT AND DROP HIM OVERBOARD DROP HIM OVERBOARD CRIED MISTER PARKER IN HORROR NOT EXACTLY BUT GET RID OF HIM
8580-287364-0007 THAT MAN IS ONE OF MY ENEMIES HE HAS BEEN SENT BY THE BAND OF DIAMOND MAKERS HIDDEN AMONG THE MOUNTAINS TO SPY ON ME AND IF POSSIBLE PREVENT ME FROM SEEKING TO DISCOVER THEIR SECRET
8580-287364-0008 HE TRIED TO WORK ON TOM'S SWIFT'S FEARS AND FRIGHTEN HIM FROM USING HIS AIRSHIP ON THIS QUEST THEN WHEN HE FAILED THE MAN MUST HAVE SNEAKED INTO THE SHED AND HIDDEN HIMSELF IN THE SHIP WE MUST GET RID OF HIM OR HE MAY WRECK THE RED CLOUD
8580-287364-0009 THAT'S SO CRIED TOM WE MUST TRY TO CAPTURE HIM I THINK WE HAD BETTER THE LAD PAUSED AND AGAIN LISTENED TO THE WIRELESS MESSAGE FATHER SAYS ERADICATE SAW THE MAN HAVE A GUN SO WE MUST BE CAREFUL
8580-287364-0010 THE YOUNG INVENTOR TRANSLATED THE DOTS AND DASHES BLESS MY POWDER HORN EXPLODED MISTER DAMON WE SHALL HAVE TO PROCEED CAUTIOUSLY THEN SPOKE MISTER JENKS
8580-287364-0011 IF HE IS LIKE ANY OTHERS IN THE GANG HE IS A DESPERATE MAN BETTER SNEAK UP ON HIM THEN IF WE CAN PROPOSED MISTER PARKER THERE ARE ENOUGH OF US TO COPE WITH ONE MAN EVEN IF HE IS ARMED
8580-287364-0012 HE INQUIRED OF TOM YES WAS THE HESITATING ANSWER BUT I DON'T WANT TO USE THEM IF I CAN HELP IT NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE DANGER AND A DISLIKE OF SHEDDING BLOOD BUT
8580-287364-0013 BECAUSE A STRAY BULLET MIGHT PIERCE THE GAS BAG AND DAMAGE THE SHIP THAT'S SO AGREED MISTER JENKS WELL I GUESS IF WE GO AT IT THE RIGHT WAY WE CAN CAPTURE HIM WITHOUT ANY SHOOTING BUT WE MUST TALK MORE QUIETLY
8580-287364-0014 HE MAY HAVE HEARD US I DON'T THINK SO REPLIED TOM THE STOREROOM IS FAR ENOUGH OFF SO THAT HE COULDN'T HEAR US BESIDES THE MOTOR MAKES SUCH A RACKET THAT HE COULDN'T DISTINGUISH WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EVEN IF HE HEARD OUR VOICES
8580-287364-0015 SO UNLESS HE HEARD THE WIRELESS WORKING AND SUSPECTS SOMETHING FROM THAT HE PROBABLY DOESN'T KNOW THAT WE ARE AWARE OF HIS PRESENCE ABOARD BUT WHY DO YOU THINK HE HAS REMAINED QUIET ALL THIS WHILE TOM ASKED MISTER DAMON
8580-287364-0016 PROBABLY HE WANTS TO WAIT UNTIL THE SHIP IS FARTHER OUT WEST SUGGESTED MISTER JENKS THEN HE WILL BE NEARER HIS FRIENDS AND CAN GET HELP IF HE NEEDS IT AND DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE HE WOULD DESTROY THE RED CLOUD ASKED MISTER PARKER
8580-287364-0017 I THINK THAT ALL HE IS WAITING FOR IS A FAVORABLE CHANCE DECLARED THE DIAMOND SEEKER HE WOULD DESTROY THE CRAFT AND US TOO IF HE COULD PREVENT US FROM DISCOVERING THE SECRET OF PHANTOM MOUNTAIN I BELIEVE
8580-287364-0018 THEN WE MUST GET AHEAD OF HIM DECIDED TOM QUIETLY I HAVE JUST FLASHED TO DAD A MESSAGE TELLING HIM THAT WE WILL HEED HIS WARNING NOW TO CAPTURE THE STOWAWAY
8580-287364-0019 AND WHILE WE'RE ABOUT IT GIVE HIM A GOOD SCARE WHEN WE DO GET HIM SUGGESTED MISTER JENKS HOW ASKED TOM THREATEN TO DROP HIM OVERBOARD PERHAPS THAT WILL MAKE HIM TELL HOW HE HAPPENED TO GET IN OUR SHIP
8580-287364-0020 AND WHAT ARE THE PLANS OF THE GANG OF DIAMOND MAKERS WE MAY GET VALUABLE INFORMATION THAT WAY I DON'T BELIEVE YOU CAN SCARE SUCH FELLOWS MUCH WAS TOM'S OPINION
8580-287364-0021 HOW ARE YOU GOING TO CAPTURE HIM ASKED MISTER PARKER IF HE HAS A GUN IT WON'T BE ANY TOO EASY TO GO IN THE STOREROOM AND DRAG HIM OUT WE'LL HAVE TO USE A LITTLE STRATEGY DECIDED TOM AND THEN THEY DISCUSSED SEVERAL PLANS
8580-287364-0022 THE ONE FINALLY ADOPTED WAS THAT TOM AND MISTER DAMON SHOULD ENTER THE STOREROOM CASUALLY AS IF IN SEARCH OF FOOD TO COOK FOR SUPPER THEY WOULD DISCUSS VARIOUS DISHES AND MISTER DAMON WAS TO EXPRESS A PREFERENCE FOR SOMETHING IN THE FOOD LINE
8580-287364-0023 THE BOX CONTAINING WHICH WAS WELL BACK IN THE ROOM THIS WOULD GIVE THE TWO A CHANCE TO PENETRATE TO THE FAR END OF THE APARTMENT WITHOUT AROUSING THE SUSPICIONS OF THE HIDDEN MAN WHO DOUBTLESS WOULD BE LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION AND AS SOON AS WE GET SIGHT OF HIM
8580-287364-0024 SAID TOM JUMP BEFORE HE HAS A CHANCE TO USE HIS GUN MISTER JENKS AND MISTER PARKER WILL BE WAITING OUTSIDE THE ROOM TO CATCH HIM IF HE GETS AWAY FROM US I'LL HAVE SOME ROPES READY AND WE'LL TIE HIM UP AND WELL WE'LL DECIDE LATER WHAT TO DO WITH HIM ALL RIGHT
8580-287364-0025 I'M READY AS SOON AS YOU ARE TOM SAID THE ECCENTRIC MAN COME AHEAD THEY WENT SOFTLY TO THE STOREROOM AND LISTENED AT THE DOOR THERE WAS NO SOUND HEARD SAVE THAT MADE BY THE MACHINERY I WONDER IF HE'S REALLY HERE
8580-287364-0026 WHISPERED MISTER DAMON WE'LL SOON FIND OUT ANSWERED TOM LET'S GO IN THEY ENTERED AND IN PURSUANCE OF THEIR PLAN TOM AND HIS FRIEND TALKED OF VARIOUS FOODS
8580-287364-0027 I THINK I'D LIKE SOME OF THAT CANNED LOBSTER WITH FRENCH DRESSING ON SPOKE THE ECCENTRIC MAN THAT'S AWAY IN THE BACK END OF THE ROOM SAID TOM IN A LOUD VOICE IT'S UNDER A LOT OF BOXES

8609-262281-0024 IT WILL BE ONLY RIGHT TO DO SO SUPPOSE WE ARE BOTH GOOD AND MERIT IT EQUALLY SUGGESTED FANNY
8609-262281-0025 YOU MUST NOT BE DISAPPOINTED IF IN THAT CASE I GIVE THE PRIVILEGE TO CAROLINE AS BEING THE ELDER OF THE TWO BUT I WILL MAKE IT UP TO YOU IN SOME OTHER WAY ALAS FOR POOR CAROLINE'S RESOLUTION FOR A SHORT TIME AN HOUR OR SO SHE DID STRIVE TO DO HER BEST
8609-262281-0026 BUT THEN GOOD RESOLUTIONS WERE FORGOTTEN AND IDLENESS FOLLOWED NOT ONLY IDLENESS TEMPER ALSO
8609-262281-0027 SHE EVEN FORGOT HERSELF SO FAR AS TO BE INSOLENT FANNY WAS TAKEN TO THE MEETING YOU SAW HER IN THE CARRIAGE WHEN LADY AUGUSTA DROVE TO MISTER GALLOWAY'S OFFICE AND PERSUADED HAMISH TO JOIN THEM CAROLINE WAS LEFT AT HOME IN A STATE OF OPEN REBELLION WITH THE LESSONS TO LEARN
8609-262281-0028 WHICH SHE HAD NOT LEARNT IN THE DAY HOW SHALL YOU GET ON WITH THEM CONSTANCE THE REV WILLIAM YORKE INQUIRED OF HER THAT SAME EVENING HAVE THE WEEDS DESTROYED THE GOOD SEED NOT QUITE DESTROYED IT REPLIED CONSTANCE THOUGH SHE SIGHED SADLY AS SHE SPOKE
8609-262281-0029 THERE IS SO MUCH ILL TO UNDO CAROLINE IS THE WORST THE WEEDS WITH HER HAVE HAD LONGER TIME TO GET AHEAD I THINK PERHAPS IF I COULD KEEP HER WHOLLY WITH ME FOR A TWELVEMONTH OR SO WATCHING OVER HER CONSTANTLY A GREAT DEAL MIGHT BE EFFECTED
8609-262281-0030 IF THAT ANTICIPATED LIVING WOULD FALL IN WHICH SEEMS VERY FAR AWAY IN THE CLOUDS AND YOU WERE WHOLLY MINE WE MIGHT HAVE CAROLINE WITH US FOR A TIME LAUGHED MISTER YORKE CONSTANCE LAUGHED TOO DO NOT BE IMPATIENT
8609-262281-0031 OR IT WILL SEEM TO BE FURTHER OFF STILL IT WILL COME WILLIAM THEY HAD BEEN SPEAKING IN AN UNDERTONE STANDING TOGETHER AT A WINDOW APART FROM THE REST MISTER CHANNING WAS LYING ON HIS SOFA UNDERNEATH THE OTHER WINDOW AND NOW SPOKE TO MISTER YORKE
8609-262281-0032 REPLIED MISTER CHANNING I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HIS EXPERIENCE IN ANOTHER LINE MAY BE OF SERVICE TO YOU CONTINUED MISTER YORKE
8609-262281-0033 I HAVE HEARD SO HIS COMPLAINT WAS RHEUMATISM VERY MUCH AS I FANCY THE SAME SORT OF RHEUMATISM THAT AFFLICTS YOU HE TOLD ME HE CAME TO EUROPE WITH VERY LITTLE HOPE HE FEARED HIS COMPLAINT HAD BECOME CHRONIC AND INCURABLE
8609-262281-0034 BUT HE HAS BEEN RESTORED IN A WONDERFUL MANNER AND IS IN SOUND HEALTH AGAIN AND WHAT REMEDIES DID HE USE EAGERLY ASKED MISTER CHANNING A THREE MONTHS RESIDENCE AT SOME MEDICINAL SPRINGS IN GERMANY NOTHING ELSE WHEN I SAY NOTHING ELSE OF COURSE I MUST IMPLY THAT HE WAS UNDER MEDICAL TREATMENT THERE
8609-262281-0035 IT IS THE VERY THING YOU SEE SIR THAT HAS BEEN ORDERED FOR YOU AY SIGHED MISTER CHANNING FEELING HOW VERY FAINT APPEARED TO BE THE HOPE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF TRYING IT I WAS MENTIONING YOUR CASE TO HIM OBSERVED MISTER YORKE
8609-262281-0036 THE CHANNINGS THEMSELVES WERE SILENT THEY COULD NOT SEE THE WAY AT ALL CLEAR WHEN MISTER YORKE WAS LEAVING HE BECKONED CONSTANCE AND ARTHUR INTO THE HALL
8609-262281-0037 THINK OF ALL THAT IS AT STAKE RENEWED HEALTH EXERTION HAPPINESS ARTHUR
8609-262281-0038 ARTHUR DID NOT FEEL HOPEFUL INDEED HIS HEART SANK WITHIN HIM THE WHOLE TIME THAT THEY WERE TALKING HAMISH AND HIS DIFFICULTIES WERE THE DARK SHADOW THOUGH HE COULD NOT TELL THIS TO MISTER YORKE WERE MISTER CHANNING TO GO ABROAD AND THE ARREST OF HAMISH TO FOLLOW UPON IT
8609-262281-0039 DOCTOR LAMB SAYS THE COST WAS SO TRIFLING AS SCARCELY TO BE CREDITED CONTINUED MISTER YORKE IN A TONE OF REMONSTRANCE ARTHUR DON'T YOU CARE TO HELP TO SAVE HIM I WOULD MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH TO SAVE MY FATHER IMPULSIVELY SPOKE ARTHUR
8609-262281-0040 STUNG BY THE IMPLIED REPROOF I SHOULD NOT CARE WHAT LABOUR IT COST ME TO PROCURE THE MONEY SO THAT I SUCCEEDED WE ALL WOULD SAID CONSTANCE YOU MUST KNOW WE WOULD WILLIAM FROM HAMISH DOWNWARDS
8609-262281-0041 DID YOU THINK I WAS LOST I WAS SEDUCED INTO JOINING YOUR MISSIONARY MEETING PEOPLE AND HAVE HAD TO STOP LATE AT THE OFFICE TO MAKE UP FOR IT
8609-262281-0042 FRESH HOPE SEEMS TO ARISE DAILY THAT THOSE GERMAN BATHS WOULD RESTORE HIM TO HEALTH THEY CURED DOCTOR LAMB I SAY HAMISH THAT THE MONEY MUST BE FOUND FOR IT SOMEHOW ADDED MISTER YORKE FOUND OF COURSE IT SHALL BE FOUND CRIED GAY HAMISH
8609-262281-0043 I INTEND TO BE A CHIEF CONTRIBUTOR TO IT MYSELF BUT HIS JOKING WORDS AND CARELESS MANNER JARRED AT THAT MOMENT UPON THE SPIRIT BOTH OF ARTHUR AND CONSTANCE CHANNING WHY
8609-283227-0000 HE AND ANOTHER FARMER HIS NEIGHBOUR HAD BEEN SO OFTEN RE ELECTED CHURCHWARDENS THAT AT LAST THEY SEEMED TO HAVE GAINED A PRESCRIPTIVE RIGHT TO THE OFFICE AND THE FORM OF ELECTION FELL INTO DISUSE
8609-283227-0001 BEEN SAID ABOUT THE ELECTION OF A COLLEAGUE SO LITTLE SEEMED TO FALL TO THE DUTY OF THE CHURCHWARDEN THAT I REGARDED THE NEGLECT AS A TRIFLE AND WAS REMISS IN SETTING IT RIGHT I HAD THEREFORE TO SUFFER AS WAS JUST INDEED MISTER BROWNRIGG WAS NOT THE MAN TO HAVE POWER IN HIS HANDS UNCHECKED
8609-283227-0002 I HAD SO FAR RECOVERED THAT I WAS ABLE TO RISE ABOUT NOON AND GO INTO MY STUDY THOUGH I WAS VERY WEAK AND HAD NOT YET BEEN OUT WHEN ONE MORNING MISSUS PEARSON CAME INTO THE ROOM AND SAID PLEASE SIR
8609-283227-0003 CONFIDENT THERE MUST BE A GOOD REASON FOR IT AND SO TOLD MISSUS PEARSON TO SHOW HIM IN OH SIR I KNOW YOU WOULD BE VEXED IF YOU HADN'T BEEN TOLD HE EXCLAIMED AND I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT BE ANGRY WITH ME FOR TROUBLING YOU WHAT IS THE MATTER TOM I SAID
8609-283227-0004 WHICH WERE NECESSARY AND MUST BE DONE BEFORE ANOTHER WINTER I CONFESS I WAS RATHER PLEASED FOR I WANTED MY PEOPLE TO FEEL THAT THE CHURCH WAS THEIR PROPERTY AND THAT IT WAS THEIR PRIVILEGE IF THEY COULD REGARD IT AS A BLESSING TO HAVE THE CHURCH TO KEEP IT IN DECENT ORDER AND REPAIR
8609-283227-0005 TO MY CHURCHWARDEN WE MUST CALL A VESTRY BEFORE LONG AND HAVE THIS LOOKED TO NOW MY PREDECESSOR HAD LEFT EVERYTHING OF THE KIND TO HIS CHURCHWARDENS AND THE INHABITANTS FROM THEIR SIDE HAD LIKEWISE LEFT THE WHOLE AFFAIR TO THE CHURCHWARDENS BUT MISTER BROWNRIGG
8609-283227-0006 WHO I MUST SAY HAD TAKEN MORE PAINS THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED OF HIM TO MAKE HIMSELF ACQUAINTED WITH THE LEGALITIES OF HIS OFFICE DID NOT FAIL TO CALL A VESTRY TO WHICH AS USUAL NO ONE HAD RESPONDED WHEREUPON HE IMPOSED A RATE ACCORDING TO HIS OWN UNAIDED JUDGMENT THIS I BELIEVE
8609-283227-0007 HE DID DURING MY ILLNESS WITH THE NOTION OF PLEASING ME BY THE DISCOVERY THAT THE REPAIRS HAD BEEN ALREADY EFFECTED ACCORDING TO MY MIND NOR DID ANY ONE OF MY CONGREGATION THROW THE LEAST DIFFICULTY IN THE CHURCHWARDEN'S WAY AND NOW I MUST REFER TO ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE HISTORY OF MY PARISH
8609-283227-0008 THERE WAS A LITTLE CHAPEL DOWN A LANE LEADING FROM THE MAIN STREET OF THE VILLAGE IN WHICH THERE WAS SERVICE THREE TIMES EVERY SUNDAY
8609-283227-0009 AMONGST WHOM WERE THE FAMILIES OF TWO OR THREE FARMERS OF SUBSTANCE WHILE THE VILLAGE AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD CONTRIBUTED A PORTION OF THE POOREST OF THE INHABITANTS A YEAR OR TWO BEFORE I CAME THEIR MINISTER DIED AND THEY HAD CHOSEN ANOTHER A VERY WORTHY MAN OF CONSIDERABLE ERUDITION
8609-283227-0010 BUT OF EXTREME VIEWS AS I HEARD UPON INSIGNIFICANT POINTS AND MOVED BY A GREAT DISLIKE TO NATIONAL CHURCHES AND EPISCOPACY THIS I SAY IS WHAT I HAD MADE OUT ABOUT HIM FROM WHAT I HAD HEARD
8609-283227-0011 AND MY READER WILL VERY PROBABLY BE INCLINED TO ASK BUT WHY WITH PRINCIPLES SUCH AS YOURS SHOULD YOU HAVE ONLY HEARSAY TO GO UPON WHY DID YOU NOT MAKE THE HONEST MAN'S ACQUAINTANCE IN SUCH A SMALL PLACE MEN SHOULD NOT KEEP EACH OTHER AT ARM'S LENGTH
8609-283227-0012 AND ANY READER WHO SAYS SO WILL SAY RIGHT ALL I HAVE TO SUGGEST FOR MYSELF IS SIMPLY A CERTAIN SHYNESS FOR WHICH I CANNOT ENTIRELY ACCOUNT BUT WHICH WAS PARTLY MADE UP OF FEAR TO INTRUDE OR OF BEING SUPPOSED TO ARROGATE TO MYSELF THE RIGHT OF MAKING ADVANCES
8609-283227-0013 PARTLY OF A DREAD LEST WE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET ON TOGETHER AND SO THE ATTEMPT SHOULD RESULT IN SOMETHING UNPLEASANTLY AWKWARD I DARESAY LIKEWISE THAT THE NATURAL SHELLINESS OF THE ENGLISH HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT AT ALL EVENTS I HAD NOT MADE HIS ACQUAINTANCE
8609-283227-0014 MISTER TEMPLETON THEN HAD REFUSED AS A POINT OF CONSCIENCE TO PAY THE CHURCH RATE WHEN THE COLLECTOR WENT ROUND TO DEMAND IT HAD BEEN SUMMONED BEFORE A MAGISTRATE IN CONSEQUENCE HAD SUFFERED A DEFAULT AND PROCEEDINGS BEING PUSHED FROM THE FIRST IN ALL THE PRIDE OF MISTER BROWNRIGG'S LEGALITY
8609-283227-0015 HAD ON THIS VERY DAY BEEN VISITED BY THE CHURCHWARDEN ACCOMPANIED BY A BROKER FROM THE NEIGHBOURING TOWN OF ADDICEHEAD AND AT THE VERY TIME WHEN I WAS HEARING OF THE FACT WAS SUFFERING DISTRAINT OF HIS GOODS THE PORCINE HEAD OF THE CHURCHWARDEN WAS NOT ON HIS SHOULDERS BY ACCIDENT NOR WITHOUT SIGNIFICANCE
8609-283227-0016 BUT I DID NOT WAIT TO UNDERSTAND ALL THIS NOW IT WAS ENOUGH FOR ME THAT TOM BORE WITNESS TO THE FACT THAT AT THAT MOMENT PROCEEDINGS WERE THUS DRIVEN TO EXTREMITY I RANG THE BELL FOR MY BOOTS AND TO THE OPEN MOUTHED DISMAY OF MISSUS PEARSON LEFT THE VICARAGE LEANING ON TOM'S ARM
8609-283227-0017 BUT SUCH WAS THE COMMOTION IN MY MIND THAT I HAD BECOME QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF ILLNESS OR EVEN FEEBLENESS HURRYING ON IN MORE TERROR THAN I CAN WELL EXPRESS LEST I SHOULD BE TOO LATE I REACHED MISTER TEMPLETON'S HOUSE JUST AS A SMALL MAHOGANY TABLE WAS BEING HOISTED INTO A SPRING CART
8609-283227-0018 WHICH STOOD AT THE DOOR BREATHLESS WITH HASTE I WAS YET ABLE TO CALL OUT PUT THAT TABLE DOWN DIRECTLY AT THE SAME MOMENT MISTER BROWNRIGG APPEARED FROM WITHIN THE DOOR
8609-283227-0019 I THINK HE HAD NOT HEARD ME YOU SEE I'M PROMPT MISTER WALTON HE SAID BUT BLESS MY SOUL HOW ILL YOU LOOK WITHOUT ANSWERING HIM FOR I WAS MORE ANGRY WITH HIM THAN I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN I REPEATED PUT THAT TABLE DOWN I TELL YOU THEY DID SO
8609-283227-0020 NOW I SAID CARRY IT BACK INTO THE HOUSE WHY SIR INTERPOSED MISTER BROWNRIGG IT'S ALL RIGHT YES I SAID AS RIGHT AS THE DEVIL WOULD HAVE IT
8609-283227-0021 I'M NOT SO SURE OF THAT I BELIEVE I HAD THE RIGHT TO BE CHAIRMAN AT THE VESTRY MEETING BUT INSTEAD OF EVEN LETTING ME KNOW YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF MY ILLNESS TO HURRY ON MATTERS TO THIS SHAMEFUL AND WICKED EXCESS I DID THE POOR MAN WRONG IN THIS FOR I BELIEVE HE HAD HURRIED THINGS REALLY TO PLEASE ME
8609-283227-0022 HIS FACE HAD LENGTHENED CONSIDERABLY BY THIS TIME AND ITS RUBICUND HUE DECLINED I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD STAND UPON CEREMONY ABOUT IT SIR
8609-283227-0023 BEFORE SUCH A THING SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED I FEEL SO DISGRACED I AM ASHAMED TO LOOK MISTER TEMPLETON IN THE FACE CARRY THAT TABLE INTO THE HOUSE AGAIN DIRECTLY IT'S MY PROPERTY NOW INTERPOSED THE BROKER I'VE BOUGHT IT OF THE CHURCHWARDEN AND PAID FOR IT
8609-283227-0024 BUT I TELL YOU THE WHOLE AFFAIR IS ILLEGAL AND IF YOU CARRY AWAY THAT TABLE I SHALL SEE WHAT THE LAW WILL DO FOR ME I ASSURE YOU I WILL PROSECUTE YOU MYSELF YOU TAKE UP THAT MONEY OR I WILL IT WILL GO TO PAY COUNSEL I GIVE YOU MY WORD IF YOU DO NOT TAKE IT TO QUENCH STRIFE
8609-283227-0025 I STRETCHED OUT MY HAND BUT THE BROKER WAS BEFORE ME WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD HE POCKETED THE MONEY JUMPED INTO HIS CART WITH HIS MAN AND DROVE OFF LEAVING THE CHURCHWARDEN AND THE PARSON STANDING AT THE DOOR OF THE DISSENTING MINISTER WITH HIS MAHOGANY TABLE ON THE PATH BETWEEN THEM NOW MISTER BROWNRIGG I SAID
8609-283227-0026 LEND ME A HAND TO CARRY THIS TABLE IN AGAIN HE YIELDED NOT GRACIOUSLY THAT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED BUT IN SILENCE OH SIR INTERPOSED YOUNG TOM WHO HAD STOOD BY DURING THE DISPUTE LET ME TAKE IT YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO LIFT IT
8609-283227-0027 AND SO MISTER BROWNRIGG AND I BLUNDERED INTO THE LITTLE PARLOUR WITH OUR BURDEN NOT A GREAT ONE
8609-283227-0028 MISTER TEMPLETON SAT IN A WINDSOR CHAIR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM EVIDENTLY THE TABLE HAD BEEN CARRIED AWAY FROM BEFORE HIM LEAVING HIS POSITION UNCOVERED THE FLOOR WAS STREWED WITH THE BOOKS WHICH HAD LAIN UPON IT HE SAT READING AN OLD FOLIO AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED
8609-283227-0029 BUT WHEN WE ENTERED HE ROSE HE WAS A MAN OF MIDDLE SIZE ABOUT FORTY WITH SHORT BLACK HAIR AND OVERHANGING BUSHY EYEBROWS HIS MOUTH INDICATED GREAT FIRMNESS NOT UNMINGLED WITH SWEETNESS AND EVEN WITH HUMOUR HE SMILED AS HE ROSE BUT LOOKED EMBARRASSED
8609-283227-0030 GLANCING FIRST AT THE TABLE THEN AT ME AND THEN AT MISTER BROWNRIGG AS IF BEGGING SOMEBODY TO TELL HIM WHAT TO SAY BUT I DID NOT LEAVE HIM A MOMENT IN THIS PERPLEXITY MISTER TEMPLETON I SAID QUITTING THE TABLE AND HOLDING OUT MY HAND
8609-283227-0031 THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN ANNOYED LIKE THIS I HAVE MISTER TEMPLETON INTERRUPTED ME I ASSURE YOU IT WAS A MATTER OF CONSCIENCE WITH ME HE SAID ON NO OTHER GROUND I KNOW IT I KNOW IT I SAID INTERRUPTING HIM IN MY TURN
8609-283227-0032 I BEG YOUR PARDON AND I HAVE DONE MY BEST TO MAKE AMENDS FOR IT OFFENCES MUST COME YOU KNOW MISTER TEMPLETON BUT I TRUST I HAVE NOT INCURRED THE WOE THAT FOLLOWS UPON THEM BY MEANS OF WHOM THEY COME FOR I KNEW NOTHING OF IT AND INDEED WAS TOO ILL
8609-283227-0033 MISTER BROWNRIGG I SPOKE IN HEAT WHEN I CAME UP TO YOU AND I AM SURE I DID YOU WRONG I AM CERTAIN YOU HAD NO IMPROPER MOTIVE IN NOT MAKING ME ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR PROCEEDINGS YOU MEANT NO HARM TO ME BUT YOU DID VERY WRONG TOWARDS MISTER TEMPLETON I WILL TRY TO SHOW YOU THAT WHEN I AM WELL AGAIN
8609-283227-0034 BUT BUT YOU MUSTN'T TALK MORE NOW SAID DOCTOR DUNCAN SO I SHOOK HANDS WITH MISTER BROWNRIGG AND WE PARTED I FEAR FROM WHAT I KNOW OF MY CHURCHWARDEN THAT HE WENT HOME WITH THE CONVICTION THAT HE HAD DONE PERFECTLY RIGHT
8609-283227-0035 AND AMONGST THEM BY MISTER TEMPLETON AND HERE I MAY AS WELL SKETCH THE RESULT OF THAT STRANGE INTRODUCTION TO THE DISSENTING MINISTER
8609-283227-0036 THE GIST OF THE LETTER LAY IN THESE WORDS I CONFESS IT PERPLEXES ME TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO RECONCILE YOUR CHRISTIAN AND FRIENDLY BEHAVIOUR TO ONE WHOM MOST OF YOUR BRETHREN WOULD CONSIDER AS MUCH BENEATH THEIR NOTICE AS INFERIOR TO THEM IN SOCIAL POSITION
8609-283227-0037 WITH YOUR REMAINING THE MINISTER OF A CHURCH IN WHICH SUCH ENORMITIES AS YOU EMPLOYED YOUR PRIVATE INFLUENCE TO COUNTERACT IN MY CASE ARE NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT CERTAINLY LAWFUL AND RECOGNIZED BY MOST OF ITS MEMBERS AS LIKEWISE EXPEDIENT TO THIS I REPLIED
8609-283227-0038 MY DEAR SIR I DO NOT LIKE WRITING LETTERS ESPECIALLY ON SUBJECTS OF IMPORTANCE THERE ARE A THOUSAND CHANCES OF MISUNDERSTANDING WHEREAS IN A PERSONAL INTERVIEW THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF CONTROVERSY BEING HALLOWED BY COMMUNION
8609-283227-0039 TO MISSUS TEMPLETON FOR NOT INVITING HER WITH YOU
8609-283227-0040 HOW YOU COULD BELONG TO A CHURCH WHICH AUTHORIZES THINGS OF WHICH YOU YOURSELF SO HEARTILY DISAPPROVE AND I ANSWER YOU I RETURNED THAT JUST TO SUCH A CHURCH OUR LORD BELONGED I DO NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND YOU OUR LORD BELONGED TO THE JEWISH CHURCH
8609-283227-0041 I WANT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SHOW YOU THE PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH HE ACTED WITH REGARD TO CHURCH RATES CERTAINLY I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR INTERRUPTING YOU THE PHARISEES DEMANDED A TRIBUTE WHICH IT IS ALLOWED WAS FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE TEMPLE AND ITS WORSHIP
8609-283227-0042 OUR LORD DID NOT REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR AUTHORITY NOTWITHSTANDING THE MANY WAYS IN WHICH THEY HAD DEGRADED THE RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES OF THE JEWISH CHURCH HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIMSELF A CHILD OF THE CHURCH BUT SAID THAT AS A CHILD HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN LEFT TO CONTRIBUTE AS HE PLEASED
8609-283227-0043 TO THE SUPPORT OF ITS ORDINANCES AND NOT TO BE COMPELLED AFTER SUCH A FASHION THERE I HAVE YOU EXCLAIMED MISTER TEMPLETON
8609-283227-0044 I GRANT IT IT IS ENTIRELY WRONG A VERY UNCHRISTIAN PROCEEDING BUT OUR LORD DID NOT THEREFORE DESERT THE CHURCH AS YOU WOULD HAVE ME DO HE PAID THE MONEY LEST HE SHOULD OFFEND AND NOT HAVING IT OF HIS OWN HE HAD TO ASK HIS FATHER FOR IT
8609-283227-0045 OR WHAT CAME TO THE SAME THING MAKE A SERVANT OF HIS FATHER NAMELY A FISH IN THE SEA OF GALILEE
8609-283227-0046 IT IS WRONG TO COMPEL AND WRONG TO REFUSE THE PAYMENT OF A CHURCH RATE I DO NOT SAY EQUALLY WRONG IT IS MUCH WORSE TO COMPEL THAN TO REFUSE YOU ARE VERY GENEROUS RETURNED MISTER TEMPLETON
8609-283227-0047 MAY I HOPE THAT YOU WILL DO ME THE CREDIT TO BELIEVE THAT IF I SAW CLEARLY THAT THEY WERE THE SAME THING I WOULD NOT HESITATE A MOMENT TO FOLLOW OUR LORD'S EXAMPLE I BELIEVE IT PERFECTLY THEREFORE HOWEVER WE MAY DIFFER WE ARE IN REALITY AT NO STRIFE
8609-283227-0048 BUT IS THERE NOT THIS DIFFERENCE THAT OUR LORD WAS AS YOU SAY A CHILD OF THE JEWISH CHURCH WHICH WAS INDUBITABLY ESTABLISHED BY GOD NOW IF I CANNOT CONSCIENTIOUSLY BELONG TO THE SO CALLED ENGLISH CHURCH WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY CHURCH RATE OR TRIBUTE
8609-283227-0049 SHALL I TELL YOU THE ARGUMENT THE ENGLISH CHURCH MIGHT THEN USE THE CHURCH MIGHT SAY THEN YOU ARE A STRANGER AND NO CHILD THEREFORE LIKE THE KINGS OF THE EARTH WE MAY TAKE TRIBUTE OF YOU SO YOU SEE IT WOULD COME TO THIS THAT DISSENTERS ALONE SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO PAY CHURCH RATES
8609-283227-0050 WE BOTH LAUGHED AT THIS PUSHING OF THE ARGUMENT TO ILLEGITIMATE CONCLUSIONS THEN I RESUMED BUT THE REAL ARGUMENT IS THAT NOT FOR SUCH FAULTS SHOULD WE SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER NOT FOR SUCH FAULTS OR ANY FAULTS SO LONG AS IT IS THE REPOSITORY OF THE TRUTH SHOULD YOU SEPARATE FROM THE CHURCH
8609-283227-0051 I WILL YIELD THE POINT WHEN YOU CAN SHOW ME THE SAME GROUND FOR BELIEVING THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND THE NATIONAL CHURCH APPOINTED SUCH BY GOD THAT I CAN SHOW YOU AND YOU KNOW ALREADY FOR RECEIVING THE JEWISH CHURCH AS THE APPOINTMENT OF GOD
8609-283227-0052 THAT WOULD INVOLVE A LONG ARGUMENT UPON WHICH THOUGH I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT UPON THE MATTER MYSELF I CANNOT SAY I AM PREPARED TO ENTER AT THIS MOMENT MEANTIME I WOULD JUST ASK YOU WHETHER YOU ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY A CHILD OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
8609-283227-0053 HAVING RECEIVED FROM IT A THOUSAND INFLUENCES FOR GOOD IF IN NO OTHER WAY YET THROUGH YOUR FATHERS TO FIND IT NO GREAT HARDSHIP AND NOT VERY UNREASONABLE TO PAY A TRIFLE TO KEEP IN REPAIR ONE OF THE TABERNACLES IN WHICH OUR FOREFATHERS WORSHIPPED TOGETHER IF
8609-283227-0054 AS I HOPE YOU WILL ALLOW IN SOME IMPERFECT MEASURE GOD IS WORSHIPPED AND THE TRUTH IS PREACHED IN IT MOST WILLINGLY WOULD I PAY THE MONEY I OBJECT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE RATE IS COMPULSORY AND THEREIN YOU HAVE OUR LORD'S EXAMPLE TO THE CONTRARY
8609-283227-0055 A SILENCE FOLLOWED FOR I HAD TO DEAL WITH AN HONEST MAN WHO WAS THINKING I RESUMED A THOUSAND DIFFICULTIES WILL NO DOUBT COME UP TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE MATTER DO NOT SUPPOSE I AM ANXIOUS TO CONVINCE YOU I BELIEVE THAT OUR FATHER OUR ELDER BROTHER
8609-283227-0056 AND THE SPIRIT THAT PROCEEDETH FROM THEM IS TEACHING YOU AS I BELIEVE I TOO AM BEING TAUGHT BY THE SAME WHY THEN SHOULD I BE ANXIOUS TO CONVINCE YOU OF ANYTHING WILL YOU NOT IN HIS GOOD TIME COME TO SEE WHAT HE WOULD HAVE YOU SEE
8609-283227-0057 I AM RELIEVED TO SPEAK MY MIND KNOWING HE WOULD HAVE US SPEAK OUR MINDS TO EACH OTHER BUT I DO NOT WANT TO PROSELYTIZE IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND YOU WILL PROBABLY DO SO ON DIFFERENT GROUNDS FROM ANY I GIVE YOU
8609-283227-0058 AND I HAVEN'T BEEN TO A UNIVERSITY LIKE YOU BUT I'M NO FOOL EITHER I HOPE DON'T BE OFFENDED AT MY QUESTION WOULDN'T YOU BE GLAD TO SEE ME OUT OF YOUR PARISH NOW I BEGAN TO SPEAK BUT HE WENT ON
8609-283227-0059 DON'T YOU REGARD ME AS AN INTERLOPER NOW ONE WHO HAS NO RIGHT TO SPEAK BECAUSE HE DOES NOT BELONG TO THE CHURCH GOD FORBID I ANSWERED IF A WORD OF MINE WOULD MAKE YOU LEAVE MY PARISH TO MORROW I DARE NOT SAY IT
8609-283227-0060 I DO NOT WANT TO INCUR THE REBUKE OF OUR LORD FOR SURELY THE WORDS FORBID HIM NOT INVOLVED SOME REBUKE WOULD IT NOT BE A FEARFUL THING THAT ONE SOUL BECAUSE OF A DEED OF MINE SHOULD RECEIVE A LESS PORTION OF ELEVATION OR COMFORT IN HIS JOURNEY TOWARDS HIS HOME
8609-283227-0061 ARE THERE NOT COUNTLESS MODES OF SAYING THE TRUTH YOU HAVE SOME OF THEM I HOPE I HAVE SOME
8609-283227-0062 WHO WILL NOT HEAR ME PREACH TO THEM IN THE NAME AND LOVE OF GOD MISTER TEMPLETON SPEAK THAT YOU DO KNOW AND TESTIFY THAT YOU HAVE SEEN YOU AND I WILL HELP EACH OTHER IN PROPORTION AS WE SERVE THE MASTER
8609-283227-0063 I ONLY SAY THAT IN SEPARATING FROM US YOU ARE IN EFFECT AND BY YOUR CONDUCT SAYING TO US DO NOT PREACH FOR YOU FOLLOW NOT WITH US I WILL NOT BE GUILTY OF THE SAME TOWARDS YOU YOUR FATHERS DID THE CHURCH NO END OF GOOD BY LEAVING IT
8609-283227-0064 BUT IT IS TIME TO UNITE NOW ONCE MORE FOLLOWED A SILENCE IF PEOPLE COULD ONLY MEET AND LOOK EACH OTHER IN THE FACE SAID MISTER TEMPLETON AT LENGTH THEY MIGHT FIND THERE WAS NOT SUCH A GULF BETWEEN THEM AS THEY HAD FANCIED AND SO WE PARTED
8609-283227-0065 NOW I DO NOT WRITE ALL THIS FOR THE SAKE OF THE CHURCH RATE QUESTION I WRITE IT TO COMMEMORATE THE SPIRIT IN WHICH MISTER TEMPLETON MET ME FOR IT IS OF CONSEQUENCE THAT TWO MEN WHO LOVE THEIR MASTER SHOULD RECOGNIZE EACH THAT THE OTHER DOES SO AND THEREUPON IF NOT BEFORE
8609-283227-0066 AND MANY A TIME ERE HIS DEATH WE CONSULTED TOGETHER ABOUT THINGS THAT BEFELL ONCE HE CAME TO ME ABOUT A LEGAL DIFFICULTY IN CONNEXION WITH THE DEED OF TRUST OF HIS CHAPEL AND ALTHOUGH I COULD NOT HELP HIM MYSELF I DIRECTED HIM TO SUCH HELP AS WAS THOROUGH
8609-283227-0067 AND COST HIM NOTHING I NEED NOT SAY HE NEVER BECAME A CHURCHMAN OR THAT I NEVER EXPECTED HE WOULD ALL HIS MEMORIES OF A RELIGIOUS CHILDHOOD ALL THE SOURCES OF THE INFLUENCES WHICH HAD REFINED AND ELEVATED HIM WERE SURROUNDED WITH OTHER ASSOCIATIONS
8609-283227-0068 THAN THOSE OF THE CHURCH AND HER FORMS THE CHURCH WAS HIS GRANDMOTHER NOT HIS MOTHER AND HE HAD NOT MADE ANY ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER TILL COMPARATIVELY LATE IN LIFE BUT WHILE I DO NOT SAY THAT HIS INTELLECTUAL OBJECTIONS TO THE CHURCH WERE LESS STRONG THAN THEY HAD BEEN
8609-283227-0069 I AM SURE THAT HIS FEELINGS WERE MODERATED EVEN CHANGED TOWARDS HER AND THOUGH THIS MAY SEEM OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO ONE WHO LOVES THE CHURCH MORE THAN THE BROTHERHOOD IT DOES NOT SEEM OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE TO ME WHO LOVE THE CHURCH BECAUSE OF THE BROTHERHOOD OF WHICH IT IS THE TYPE AND THE RESTORER
8609-283227-0070 IT WAS LONG BEFORE ANOTHER CHURCH RATE WAS LEVIED IN MARSHMALLOWS AND WHEN THE CIRCUMSTANCE DID TAKE PLACE NO ONE DREAMED OF CALLING ON MISTER TEMPLETON FOR HIS SHARE IN IT BUT HAVING HEARD OF IT HE CALLED HIMSELF UPON THE CHURCHWARDEN MISTER BROWNRIGG STILL AND OFFERED THE MONEY CHEERFULLY
8629-261139-0000 ALL THE WITNESSES WHO HAD ANYTHING TO SAY HAD LONG AGO GIVEN IN THEIR TESTIMONY AND WHEN AT OR NEAR NOON
8629-261139-0001 IT WAS TO FIND IN TWO FACES ONLY ANY SIGNS OF THE EAGERNESS AND EXPECTANCY WHICH FILLED HIS OWN BREAST TO SUFFOCATION BUT AS THESE FACES WERE THOSE OF AGNES HALLIDAY AND AMABEL PAGE
8629-261139-0002 HE SOON RECOGNISED THAT HIS OWN JUDGMENT WAS NOT AT FAULT AND THAT NOTWITHSTANDING OUTWARD APPEARANCES AND THE LANGUID INTEREST SHOWN IN THE NOW LAGGING PROCEEDINGS
8629-261139-0003 BUT VITAL CONSEQUENCE FREDERICK WAS NOT VISIBLE IN THE GREAT HALL BUT THAT HE WAS NEAR AT HAND SOON BECAME EVIDENT FROM THE CHANGE SWEETWATER NOW SAW IN AMABEL
8629-261139-0004 FOR WHILE SHE HAD HITHERTO SAT UNDER THE UNIVERSAL GAZE WITH ONLY THE FAINT SMILE OF CONSCIOUS BEAUTY ON HER INSCRUTABLE FEATURES
8629-261139-0005 AND GLANCED AT THE GREAT DOOR OF ENTRANCE WITH AN EVIL EXPECTANCY THAT STARTLED EVEN SWEETWATER SO LITTLE HAD HE REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE NATURE OF THE PASSIONS LABOURING IN THAT VENOMOUS BREAST
8629-261139-0006 SMILED AS SHE MET HIS EYE WITH THAT CURIOUS SLOW DIPPING OF HER DIMPLES WHICH HAD MORE THAN ONCE CONFOUNDED THE CORONER AND RENDERED HER AT ONCE THE ADMIRATION AND ABHORRENCE OF THE CROWD
8629-261139-0007 LOOKED AWAY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
8629-261139-0008 FROM WHICH HE HAD REMOVED THE RING WHICH UP TO THIS HOUR HE HAD INVARIABLY WORN ON HIS THIRD FINGER IN THIS GLANCE OF HERS AND THIS ACTION OF HIS BEGAN THE STRUGGLE THAT WAS TO MAKE THAT DAY MEMORABLE IN MANY HEARTS
8629-261139-0009 AND TO HIM A FULL ATTENTION WAS BEING GIVEN IN THE HOPE THAT SOME REAL ENLIGHTENMENT WOULD COME AT LAST TO SETTLE THE QUESTIONS WHICH HAD BEEN RAISED BY AMABEL'S INCOMPLETE AND UNSATISFACTORY TESTIMONY BUT NO MAN CAN FURNISH WHAT HE DOES NOT POSSESS
8629-261139-0010 AND THE FEW FINAL MINUTES BEFORE NOON PASSED BY WITHOUT ANY ADDITION BEING MADE TO THE FACTS WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN PRESENTED FOR GENERAL CONSIDERATION AS THE WITNESS SAT DOWN THE CLOCK BEGAN TO STRIKE AS THE SLOW
8629-261139-0011 HESITATING STROKES RANG OUT SWEETWATER SAW FREDERICK YIELD TO A SUDDEN BUT MOST PROFOUND EMOTION THE OLD FEAR WHICH WE UNDERSTAND IF SWEETWATER DID NOT HAD AGAIN SEIZED THE VICTIM OF AMABEL'S AMBITION
8629-261139-0012 WITH A FELL AND STEADY PURPOSE HE FOUND HIS RIGHT HAND STEALING TOWARD THE LEFT IN THE SIGNIFICANT ACTION SHE EXPECTED BETTER TO YIELD THAN FALL HEADLONG INTO THE PIT ONE WORD OF HERS WOULD OPEN
8629-261139-0013 HE HAD NOT MEANT TO YIELD BUT NOW THAT THE MOMENT HAD COME NOW THAT HE MUST AT ONCE AND FOREVER CHOOSE BETWEEN A COURSE THAT LED SIMPLY TO PERSONAL UNHAPPINESS AND ONE THAT INVOLVED NOT ONLY HIMSELF
8629-261139-0014 BUT THOSE DEAREST TO HIM IN DISGRACE AND SORROW HE FELT HIMSELF WEAKEN TO THE POINT OF CLUTCHING AT WHATEVER WOULD SAVE HIM FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF CONFESSION MORAL STRENGTH AND THAT TENACITY OF PURPOSE
8629-261139-0015 WHICH ONLY COMES FROM YEARS OF SELF CONTROL WERE TOO LATELY AWAKENED IN HIS BREAST TO SUSTAIN HIM NOW AS STROKE AFTER STROKE FELL ON THE EAR HE FELT HIMSELF YIELDING BEYOND RECOVERY
8629-261139-0016 AND HAD ALMOST TOUCHED HIS FINGER IN THE SIGNIFICANT ACTION OF ASSENT WHICH AMABEL AWAITED WITH BREATHLESS EXPECTATION WHEN WAS IT MIRACLE OR ONLY THE SUGGESTION OF HIS BETTER NATURE
8629-261139-0017 THE MEMORY OF A FACE FULL OF HOLY PLEADING ROSE FROM THE PAST BEFORE HIS EYES AND WITH AN INNER CRY OF MOTHER HE FLUNG HIS HAND OUT AND CLUTCHED HIS FATHER'S ARM IN A WAY TO BREAK THE CHARM OF HIS OWN DREAD
8629-261139-0018 AND END FOREVER THE EFFECTS OF THE INTOLERABLE FASCINATION THAT WAS WORKING UPON HIM NEXT MINUTE THE LAST STROKE OF NOON RANG OUT AND THE HOUR WAS UP WHICH AMABEL HAD SET AS THE LIMIT OF HER SILENCE A PAUSE
8629-261139-0019 WHICH TO THEIR TWO HEARTS IF TO NO OTHERS SEEMED STRANGELY APPROPRIATE FOLLOWED THE CESSATION OF THESE SOUNDS THEN THE WITNESS WAS DISMISSED AND AMABEL
8629-261139-0020 WHEN FREDERICK LEAPING WITH A BOUND TO HIS FEET DREW ALL EYES TOWARDS HIMSELF WITH THE CRY LET ME BE PUT ON MY OATH I HAVE TESTIMONY TO GIVE OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE IN THIS CASE THE CORONER WAS ASTOUNDED
8629-261139-0021 EVERYONE WAS ASTOUNDED NO ONE HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING FROM HIM AND INSTINCTIVELY EVERY EYE TURNED TOWARDS AMABEL TO SEE HOW SHE WAS AFFECTED BY HIS ACTION STRANGELY EVIDENTLY
8629-261139-0022 EVER FORGOT THOUGH IT CONVEYED NO HINT OF HER REAL FEELINGS WHICH WERE SOMEWHAT CHAOTIC FREDERICK WHO HAD FORGOTTEN HER NOW THAT HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO SPEAK WAITED FOR THE CORONER'S REPLY IF YOU HAVE TESTIMONY
8629-261139-0023 SAID THAT GENTLEMAN AFTER EXCHANGING A FEW HURRIED WORDS WITH MISTER COURTNEY AND THE SURPRISED KNAPP YOU CAN DO NO BETTER THAN GIVE IT TO US AT ONCE MISTER FREDERICK SUTHERLAND WILL YOU TAKE THE STAND
8629-261139-0024 WITH A NOBLE AIR FROM WHICH ALL HESITATION HAD VANISHED FREDERICK STARTED TOWARDS THE PLACE INDICATED BUT STOPPED BEFORE HE HAD TAKEN A HALF DOZEN STEPS
8629-261139-0025 GO HE WHISPERED BUT IN SO THRILLING A TONE IT WAS HEARD TO THE REMOTEST CORNER OF THE ROOM SPARE ME THE ANGUISH OF SAYING WHAT I HAVE TO SAY IN YOUR PRESENCE I COULD NOT BEAR IT YOU COULD NOT BEAR IT LATER
8629-261139-0026 IF YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME IN ONE OF THESE ROOMS I WILL REPEAT MY TALE IN YOUR EARS BUT GO NOW IT IS MY LAST ENTREATY THERE WAS A SILENCE NO ONE VENTURED A DISSENT
8629-261139-0027 NO ONE SO MUCH AS MADE A GESTURE OF DISAPPROVAL THEN MISTER SUTHERLAND STRUGGLED TO HIS FEET CAST ONE LAST LOOK AROUND HIM AND DISAPPEARED THROUGH A DOOR WHICH HAD OPENED LIKE MAGIC BEFORE HIM THEN AND NOT TILL THEN
8629-261139-0028 DID FREDERICK MOVE FORWARD THE MOMENT WAS INTENSE THE CORONER SEEMED TO SHARE THE UNIVERSAL EXCITEMENT
8629-261139-0029 THIS YOU WILL BELIEVE WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I WAS THE PERSON MISS PAGE FOLLOWED INTO MISSUS WEBB'S HOUSE AND WHOM SHE HEARD DESCEND THE STAIRS DURING THE MOMENT SHE CROUCHED BEHIND THE FIGURE OF THE SLEEPING PHILEMON IT WAS MORE
8629-261139-0030 INFINITELY MORE THAN ANYONE THERE HAD EXPECTED
8629-261139-0031 AND THE SHOCK THE SURPRISE
8629-261139-0032 WAS ALMOST APPALLING IN ITS INTENSITY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MISTER SUTHERLAND'S NEAR PRESENCE THE FEELING WOULD HAVE RISEN TO OUTBREAK AND MANY VOICES WERE HELD IN SUBJECTION BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF THIS VENERATED MAN'S LAST LOOK
8629-261139-0033 THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE MADE THEMSELVES HEARD IN DESPITE OF THE RESTRICTIONS OF THE PLACE AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE POLICE TO FREDERICK IT WAS A MOMENT OF IMMEASURABLE GRIEF AND HUMILIATION
8629-261139-0034 ON EVERY FACE IN EVERY SHRINKING FORM IN SUBDUED MURMURS AND OPEN CRIES HE READ INSTANT AND COMPLETE CONDEMNATION AND YET IN ALL HIS LIFE FROM BOYHOOD UP TO THIS HOUR NEVER HAD HE BEEN SO WORTHY OF THEIR ESTEEM AND CONSIDERATION
8629-261139-0035 HE DID NOT LOSE HIS DETERMINED ATTITUDE HE HAD OBSERVED A CHANGE IN AMABEL AND A CHANGE IN AGNES AND IF ONLY TO DISAPPOINT THE VILE TRIUMPH OF THE ONE
8629-261139-0036 HE WITHSTOOD THE CLAMOUR AND BEGAN SPEAKING AGAIN BEFORE THE CORONER HAD BEEN ABLE TO FULLY RESTORE QUIET I KNOW SAID HE
8629-261139-0037 BUT IF ANYONE WHO LISTENS TO ME THINKS ME GUILTY OF THE DEATH I WAS SO UNFORTUNATE AS TO HAVE WITNESSED
8629-261139-0038 DOCTOR TALBOT AND YOU GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY IN THE FACE OF GOD AND MAN I HERE DECLARE THAT MISSUS WEBB IN MY PRESENCE AND BEFORE MY EYES
8629-261139-0039 GAVE TO HERSELF THE BLOW WHICH HAS ROBBED US ALL OF A MOST VALUABLE LIFE SHE WAS NOT MURDERED IT WAS A SOLEMN ASSERTION BUT IT FAILED TO CONVINCE THE CROWD BEFORE HIM AS BY ONE IMPULSE MEN AND WOMEN BROKE INTO A TUMULT
8629-261139-0040 SHE WAS TOO GOOD IT'S ALL CALUMNY A WRETCHED LIE BROKE IN UNRESTRAINED EXCITEMENT FROM EVERY PART OF THE LARGE ROOM IN VAIN THE CORONER SMOTE WITH HIS GAVEL IN VAIN THE LOCAL POLICE ENDEAVOURED TO RESTORE ORDER
8629-261139-0041 THE TIDE WAS UP AND OVER SWEPT EVERYTHING FOR AN INSTANT
8629-261139-0042 OF AMABEL SMOOTHING OUT THE FOLDS OF HER CRISP WHITE FROCK WITH AN INCREDULOUS ALMOST INSULTING SMILE THAT AT ONCE FIXED ATTENTION AGAIN ON FREDERICK HE SEIZED THE OCCASION AND SPOKE UP IN A TONE OF GREAT RESOLVE
8629-261139-0043 I HAVE MADE AN ASSERTION SAID HE BEFORE GOD AND BEFORE THIS JURY TO MAKE IT SEEM A CREDIBLE ONE I SHALL HAVE TO TELL MY OWN STORY FROM THE BEGINNING AM I ALLOWED TO DO SO MISTER CORONER YOU ARE
8629-261139-0044 WAS THE FIRM RESPONSE THEN GENTLEMEN CONTINUED FREDERICK STILL WITHOUT LOOKING AT AMABEL WHOSE SMILE HAD ACQUIRED A MOCKERY THAT DREW THE EYES OF THE JURY TOWARD HER MORE THAN ONCE DURING THE FOLLOWING RECITAL
8629-261139-0045 YOU KNOW AND THE PUBLIC GENERALLY NOW KNOW THAT MISSUS WEBB HAS LEFT ME THE GREATER PORTION OF THE MONEY OF WHICH SHE DIED POSSESSED I HAVE NEVER BEFORE ACKNOWLEDGED TO ANYONE NOT EVEN TO THE GOOD MAN WHO AWAITS THIS JURY'S VERDICT
8629-261139-0046 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR YONDER THAT SHE HAD REASONS FOR THIS GOOD REASONS REASONS OF WHICH UP TO THE VERY EVENING OF HER DEATH
8629-261139-0047 OR THAT I WAS THE SPECIAL OBJECT OF HER ATTENTION OR THAT WE WERE UNDER ANY MUTUAL OBLIGATIONS IN ANY WAY WHY THEN I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF GOING TO HER IN THE GREAT STRAIT IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF ON THAT DAY
8629-261139-0048 I CANNOT SAY I KNEW SHE HAD MONEY IN HER HOUSE THIS I HAD UNHAPPILY BEEN MADE ACQUAINTED WITH IN AN ACCIDENTAL WAY
8629-261139-0049 AND QUITE CAPABLE OF DOING A VERY UNSELFISH ACT STILL THIS WOULD NOT SEEM TO BE REASON ENOUGH FOR ME TO INTRUDE UPON HER LATE AT NIGHT WITH A PLEA FOR A LARGE LOAN OF MONEY HAD I NOT BEEN IN A DESPERATE CONDITION OF MIND
8629-261139-0050 WHICH MADE ANY ATTEMPT SEEM REASONABLE THAT PROMISED RELIEF FROM THE UNENDURABLE BURDEN OF A PRESSING AND DISREPUTABLE DEBT I WAS OBLIGED TO HAVE MONEY A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND I HAD TO HAVE IT AT ONCE
8629-261139-0051 AS I HAD BEEN TOLD EARLY IN THE EVENING A SMALL ENTERTAINMENT WAS BEING GIVEN WHICH WOULD INSURE ITS BEING OPEN EVEN AT SO LATE AN HOUR AS MIDNIGHT MISS PAGE WHO WILL I AM SURE PARDON THE INTRODUCTION OF HER NAME INTO THIS NARRATIVE
8629-261139-0052 HAS TAKEN PAINS TO DECLARE TO YOU THAT IN THE EXPEDITION SHE HERSELF MADE INTO TOWN THAT EVENING SHE FOLLOWED SOME PERSON'S STEPS DOWN HILL THIS IS VERY LIKELY TRUE AND THOSE STEPS WERE PROBABLY MINE FOR AFTER LEAVING THE HOUSE BY THE GARDEN DOOR
8629-261139-0053 AND SO HASTENED ON TILL I CAME TO THE GATE ON HIGH STREET HERE I HAD A MOMENT OF HESITATION AND THOUGHTS BITTER ENOUGH FOR ME TO RECALL THEM AT THIS MOMENT CAME INTO MY MIND
8629-261139-0054 BUT THEY PASSED THANK GOD AND WITH NO MORE DESPERATE FEELING THAN A SULLEN INTENTION OF HAVING MY OWN WAY ABOUT THIS MONEY I LIFTED THE LATCH OF THE FRONT DOOR AND STEPPED IN
8629-261139-0055 OR AT LEAST TO HEAR THE SOUND OF MERRY VOICES AND LAUGHTER IN THE ROOMS ABOVE BUT NO SOUNDS OF ANY SORT AWAITED ME INDEED THE HOUSE SEEMED STRANGELY SILENT FOR ONE SO FULLY LIGHTED AND ASTONISHED AT THIS
8629-261139-0056 I PUSHED THE DOOR AJAR AT MY LEFT AND LOOKED IN AN UNEXPECTED AND PITIFUL SIGHT AWAITED ME
8629-261139-0057 I SAW THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WITH HIS HEAD SUNK FORWARD ON HIS ARMS ASLEEP THE EXPECTED GUESTS HAD FAILED TO ARRIVE AND HE TIRED OUT WITH WAITING HAD FALLEN INTO A DOZE AT THE BOARD
8629-261139-0058 THIS WAS A CONDITION OF THINGS FOR WHICH I WAS NOT PREPARED MISSUS WEBB WHOM I WISHED TO SEE WAS PROBABLY UP STAIRS AND WHILE I MIGHT SUMMON HER BY A STURDY RAP ON THE DOOR BESIDE WHICH I STOOD I HAD SO LITTLE DESIRE TO WAKE HER HUSBAND
8629-261139-0059 OF WHOSE MENTAL CONDITION I WAS WELL AWARE THAT I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO MAKE ANY LOUD NOISE WITHIN HIS HEARING YET I HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO RETREAT ALL MY HOPE OF RELIEF FROM THE MANY DIFFICULTIES THAT MENACED ME
8629-261139-0060 LAY IN THE GENEROSITY OF THIS GREAT HEARTED WOMAN AND IF OUT OF PUSILLANIMITY
8629-261139-0061 NOTHING BUT SHAME AND DISASTER AWAITED ME YET HOW COULD I HOPE TO LURE HER DOWN STAIRS WITHOUT NOISE I COULD NOT AND SO YIELDING TO THE IMPULSE OF THE MOMENT WITHOUT ANY REALISATION
8629-261139-0062 I SLIPPED UP THE NARROW STAIRCASE
8629-261139-0063 FOR SHE ROSE AND MEETING MY EYE WITH A GAZE IN WHICH SHOCK AND SOME STRANGE AND POIGNANT AGONY TOTALLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME WERE STRANGELY BLENDED SHE CRIED OUT NO NO FREDERICK YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING
8629-261139-0064 IF YOU WANT MY MONEY TAKE IT IF YOU WANT MY LIFE
8629-261139-0065 DON'T STAIN YOURS DON'T I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HER I DID NOT KNOW UNTIL I THOUGHT IT OVER AFTERWARD THAT MY HAND WAS THRUST CONVULSIVELY INTO MY BREAST IN A WAY WHICH TAKEN WITH MY WILD MIEN
8629-261139-0066 GIVE THEN I WANT HUNDREDS THOUSANDS NOW NOW TO SAVE MYSELF DISGRACE SHAME PRISON AWAIT ME IF I DON'T HAVE THEM GIVE GIVE AND MY HAND WENT OUT TOWARD IT NOT TOWARD HER
8629-261139-0067 BUT SHE MISTOOK THE ACTION MISTOOK MY PURPOSE AND
8629-261139-0068 MORE THAN THE OUTWARD SEEMING OF HER LIFE CAN HARDLY MEASURE PLUNGED AGAINST IT AND I CAN TELL YOU NO MORE HER BLOOD AND BATSY'S SHRIEK FROM THE ADJOINING ROOM SWAM THROUGH MY CONSCIOUSNESS AND THEN SHE FELL AS I SUPPOSED
8629-261139-0069 AND I IN SCARCELY BETTER CASE FELL ALSO THIS AS GOD LIVES IS THE TRUTH CONCERNING THE WOUND FOUND IN THE BREAST OF THIS NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN WOMAN THE FEELING THE PATHOS THE ANGUISH EVEN TO BE FOUND IN HIS TONE MADE THIS STORY
8629-261139-0070 SEEMED APPEAR FOR THE MOMENT PLAUSIBLE AND BATSY ASKED THE CORONER MUST HAVE FALLEN WHEN WE DID FOR I NEVER HEARD HER VOICE AFTER THE FIRST SCREAM BUT I SHALL SPEAK OF HER AGAIN
8629-261139-0071 WHAT I MUST NOW EXPLAIN IS HOW THE MONEY IN MISSUS WEBB'S DRAWER CAME INTO MY POSSESSION AND HOW THE DAGGER SHE HAD PLANTED IN HER BREAST CAME TO BE FOUND ON THE LAWN OUTSIDE WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF AND THAT MUST HAVE BEEN VERY SOON I FOUND
8629-261139-0072 THAT THE BLOW OF WHICH I HAD BEEN SUCH A HORRIFIED WITNESS HAD NOT YET PROVED FATAL THE EYES I HAD SEEN CLOSE AS I HAD SUPPOSED FOREVER WERE NOW OPEN AND SHE WAS LOOKING AT ME WITH A SMILE THAT HAS NEVER LEFT MY MEMORY AND NEVER WILL
8629-261139-0073 THERE IS NO BLOOD ON YOU SHE MURMURED YOU DID NOT STRIKE THE BLOW
8629-261139-0074 THERE ARE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ON THAT TABLE TAKE THEM AND LET THEM PAVE YOUR WAY TO A BETTER LIFE
8629-261139-0075 DO THESE WORDS THIS ACTION OF HERS SEEM INCREDIBLE TO YOU SIRS ALAS ALAS THEY WILL NOT WHEN I TELL YOU AND HERE HE CAST ONE ANXIOUS DEEPLY ANXIOUS GLANCE AT THE ROOM IN WHICH MISTER SUTHERLAND WAS HIDDEN
8629-261139-0076 THAT UNKNOWN TO ME UNKNOWN TO ANYONE LIVING BUT HERSELF UNKNOWN TO THAT GOOD MAN FROM WHOM IT CAN NO LONGER BE KEPT HIDDEN AGATHA WEBB WAS MY MOTHER
8629-261140-0000 AND GRADUALLY SUBSIDE SO THIS CROWD YIELDED TO ITS AWE AND MAN BY MAN SANK BACK INTO HIS SEAT TILL QUIET WAS AGAIN RESTORED AND ONLY A CIRCLE OF LISTENING FACES CONFRONTED THE MAN WHO HAD JUST STIRRED A WHOLE ROOMFUL TO ITS DEPTHS
8629-261140-0001 SEEING THIS AND REALISING HIS OPPORTUNITY FREDERICK AT ONCE ENTERED INTO THE EXPLANATIONS FOR WHICH EACH HEART THERE PANTED THIS WILL BE OVERWHELMING NEWS TO HIM WHO HAS CARED FOR ME SINCE INFANCY
8629-261140-0002 YOU HAVE HEARD HIM CALL ME SON WITH WHAT WORDS SHALL I OVERTHROW HIS CONFIDENCE IN THE TRUTH AND RECTITUDE OF HIS LONG BURIED WIFE AND MAKE HIM KNOW IN HIS OLD AGE THAT HE HAS WASTED YEARS OF PATIENCE UPON ONE WHO WAS NOT OF HIS BLOOD
8629-261140-0003 OR LINEAGE THE WONDER THE INCREDULITY YOU MANIFEST ARE MY BEST EXCUSE FOR MY LONG DELAY IN REVEALING THE SECRET ENTRUSTED TO ME BY THIS DYING WOMAN AN AWED SILENCE GREETED THESE WORDS
8629-261140-0004 THE ASTOUNDING FACT WHICH I HAVE JUST COMMUNICATED TO YOU WAS MADE KNOWN BY MY MOTHER WITH THE DAGGER STILL PLUNGED IN HER BREAST SHE WOULD NOT LET ME DRAW IT OUT SHE KNEW THAT DEATH WOULD FOLLOW THAT ACT
8629-261140-0005 AND SHE PRIZED EVERY MOMENT REMAINING TO HER BECAUSE OF THE BLISS SHE ENJOYED OF SEEING
8629-261140-0006 THE LOVE THE PASSION
8629-261140-0007 TRANSFORMED ME IN AN INSTANT FROM A SELFISH BRUTE INTO A DEEPLY REPENTANT MAN I KNELT BEFORE HER IN ANGUISH I MADE HER FEEL THAT WICKED AS I HAD BEEN I WAS NOT
8629-261140-0008 AND WHEN I SAW BY HER CLEARING BROW AND PEACEFUL LOOK THAT I HAD FULLY PERSUADED HER OF THIS I LET HER SPEAK WHAT WORDS SHE WOULD AND TELL AS SHE WAS ABLE
8629-261140-0009 IT IS A SACRED STORY TO ME AND IF YOU MUST KNOW IT LET IT BE FROM HER OWN WORDS IN THE LETTERS SHE LEFT BEHIND HER SHE ONLY TOLD ME THAT TO SAVE ME FROM THE FATE OF THE CHILDREN WHO HAD PRECEDED ME
8629-261140-0010 AND UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES CALCULATED TO DECEIVE MISTER SUTHERLAND CONSEQUENTLY HE HAD NEVER KNOWN I WAS NOT HIS OWN CHILD
8629-261140-0011 SHE ENJOINED ME NOT TO ENLIGHTEN HIM NOW IF BY ANY SACRIFICE ON MY PART I COULD RIGHTFULLY AVOID IT THAT SHE WAS HAPPY IN HAVING ME HEAR THE TRUTH BEFORE SHE DIED THAT THE JOY WHICH THIS GAVE HER WAS SO GREAT
8629-261140-0012 SHE DID NOT REGRET HER FATAL ACT VIOLENT AND UNCALLED FOR AS IT WAS FOR IT HAD SHOWED HER MY HEART AND ALLOWED ME TO READ HERS
8629-261140-0013 AND SHE MADE ME PROMISE I WOULD CARE FOR HIM TO THE LAST WITH TENDERNESS SAYING THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS WITHOUT SEEMING IMPROPRIETY SINCE SHE HAD WILLED ME ALL HER FORTUNE UNDER THIS PROVISO FINALLY
8629-261140-0014 AND THOUGH HER STRENGTH AND BREATH WERE FAST FAILING HER SHE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE ZABELS WHO HAD NOT COME ACCORDING TO A SACRED CUSTOM BETWEEN THEM TO CELEBRATE THE ANNIVERSARY OF HER WEDDING
8629-261140-0015 AND PRAYED ME TO SEE THE TWO OLD GENTLEMEN BEFORE I SLEPT SINCE NOTHING BUT DEATH OR DIRE DISTRESS WOULD HAVE KEPT THEM FROM GRATIFYING THE ONE WHIM OF MY FATHER'S FAILING MIND I PROMISED
8629-261140-0016 SHE POINTED TO THE DAGGER IN HER BREAST BUT BEFORE I COULD LAY MY HAND UPON IT SHE CALLED FOR BATSY I WANT HER TO HEAR ME DECLARE BEFORE I GO SAID SHE THAT THIS STROKE WAS DELIVERED BY MYSELF UPON MYSELF
8629-261140-0017 BUT WHEN I ROSE TO LOOK FOR BATSY I FOUND THAT THE SHOCK OF HER MISTRESS'S FATAL ACT HAD KILLED HER
8629-261140-0018 IN CASE MY PRESENCE IN THIS HOUSE OF DEATH SHOULD BECOME KNOWN
8629-261140-0019 FOR FEAR IT WOULD MAKE HER LAST MOMENTS MISERABLE
8629-261140-0020 BUT WAS TOO TERRIFIED TO MOVE OR SPEAK AND THIS SATISFIED MY MOTHER AND MADE HER LAST BREATH ONE OF TRUST AND CONTENTED LOVE SHE DIED AS I DREW THE DAGGER FROM HER BREAST
8629-261140-0021 AND FLUNG IT WILDLY FROM THE WINDOW THEN I LIFTED HER AND LAID HER WHERE YOU FOUND HER ON THE SOFA
8629-261140-0022 JAMES ZABEL MUCH LESS THAT IT BORE HIS INITIALS ON THE HANDLE HE PAUSED AND THE AWE OCCASIONED BY THE SCENE HE HAD DESCRIBED WAS SO DEEP AND THE SILENCE SO PROLONGED THAT A SHUDDER PASSED OVER THE WHOLE ASSEMBLAGE
8629-261140-0023 WHEN FROM SOME UNKNOWN QUARTER A SINGLE CUTTING VOICE AROSE IN THIS ONE SHORT MOCKING COMMENT OH THE FAIRY TALE WAS IT AMABEL WHO SPOKE SOME THOUGHT SO AND LOOKED HER WAY
8629-261140-0024 AS IF BEGGING PARDON FOR THE WICKED DOUBTS WHICH HAD DRIVEN HIM TO THIS DEFENCE FREDERICK MET THAT LOOK WITH ONE SO SEVERE IT PARTOOK OF HARSHNESS THEN RESUMING HIS TESTIMONY HE SAID
8629-261140-0025 AND OF HOW ONE OF THEM JAMES BY NAME CAME TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS AFFAIR WHEN I LEFT MY DEAD MOTHER'S SIDE I WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF MIND THAT I PASSED WITH SCARCELY SO MUCH AS A GLANCE THE ROOM WHERE MY NEW FOUND FATHER SAT SLEEPING
8629-261140-0026 BUT AS I HASTENED ON TOWARD THE QUARTER WHERE THE ZABELS LIVED I WAS SEIZED BY SUCH COMPUNCTION FOR HIS DESOLATE STATE THAT I FALTERED IN MY RAPID FLIGHT AND DID NOT ARRIVE AT THE PLACE OF MY DESTINATION AS QUICKLY AS I INTENDED WHEN I DID
8629-261140-0027 BUT I DID NOT TURN AWAY REMEMBERING MY MOTHER'S ANXIETY AN ANXIETY SO EXTREME IT DISTURBED HER FINAL MOMENTS I APPROACHED THE FRONT DOOR AND WAS ABOUT TO KNOCK WHEN I FOUND IT OPEN GREATLY ASTONISHED I AT ONCE PASSED IN
8629-261140-0028 AND SEEING MY WAY PERFECTLY IN THE MOONLIGHT ENTERED THE ROOM ON THE LEFT THE DOOR OF WHICH ALSO STOOD OPEN IT WAS THE SECOND HOUSE I HAD ENTERED UNANNOUNCED THAT NIGHT AND IN THIS AS IN THE OTHER
8629-261140-0029 I ENCOUNTERED A MAN SITTING ASLEEP BY THE TABLE IT WAS JOHN THE ELDER OF THE TWO AND PERCEIVING THAT HE WAS SUFFERING FOR FOOD AND IN A CONDITION OF EXTREME MISERY I TOOK OUT THE FIRST BILL MY HAND ENCOUNTERED
8629-261140-0030 AS I DID SO HE GAVE A SIGH BUT DID NOT WAKE
8629-261140-0031 I HASTENED AWAY AND TOOK THE SHORTEST PATH HOME HAD I BEEN MORE OF A MAN OR IF MY VISIT TO MISSUS WEBB HAD BEEN ACTUATED BY A MORE COMMUNICABLE MOTIVE I WOULD HAVE GONE AT ONCE TO THE GOOD MAN WHO BELIEVED ME TO BE OF HIS OWN FLESH AND BLOOD
8629-261140-0032 AND TOLD HIM OF THE STRANGE AND HEART RENDING ADVENTURE WHICH HAD CHANGED THE WHOLE TENOR OF MY THOUGHTS AND LIFE
8629-261140-0033 IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF PLACED BUT THE MEMORY OF A THOUSAND PAST INGRATITUDES TOGETHER WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SHOCK WHICH HE COULD NOT FAIL TO RECEIVE ON LEARNING AT THIS LATE DAY
8629-261140-0034 WAS NEITHER OF HER BLOOD NOR HIS ROSE UP BETWEEN US AND CAUSED ME NOT ONLY TO ATTEMPT SILENCE BUT TO SECRETE IN THE ADJOINING WOODS THE MONEY I HAD RECEIVED IN THE VAIN HOPE THAT ALL VISIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN MYSELF AND MY MOTHER'S TRAGIC DEATH
8629-261140-0035 WOULD THUS BE LOST YOU SEE I HAD NOT CALCULATED ON MISS AMABEL PAGE
8629-261140-0036 STARTLED THE CROWD AND GAVE SWEETWATER ALREADY SUFFERING UNDER SHOCK AFTER SHOCK OF MINGLED SURPRISE AND WONDER
8629-261140-0037 AND THAT SOMETHING BESIDES JUSTICE HAD ACTUATED AMABEL IN HER TREATMENT OF THIS YOUNG MAN THIS FEELING WAS SHARED BY OTHERS AND A REACTION SET IN IN FREDERICK'S FAVOUR WHICH EVEN AFFECTED THE OFFICIALS WHO WERE CONDUCTING THE INQUIRY
8629-261140-0038 FREDERICK HIMSELF FELT THE CHANGE AND SHOWED IT BY THE LOOK OF RELIEF AND GROWING CONFIDENCE HE CAST AT AGNES OF THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS WHICH NOW PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND THE VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE JURY I NEED GIVE NO ACCOUNT
8629-261140-0039 THEY BUT EMPHASISED FACTS ALREADY KNOWN AND PRODUCED BUT LITTLE CHANGE IN THE GENERAL FEELING
8629-261140-0040 WHEN HE WAS ALLOWED TO RESUME HIS SEAT
8629-261140-0041 SHE ROSE WITH A BOUND NOUGHT THAT SHE HAD ANTICIPATED HAD OCCURRED FACTS OF WHICH SHE COULD KNOW NOTHING HAD CHANGED THE ASPECT OF AFFAIRS AND MADE THE POSITION OF FREDERICK SOMETHING SO REMOTE FROM ANY SHE COULD HAVE IMAGINED
8629-261140-0042 THAT SHE WAS STILL IN THE MAZE OF THE NUMBERLESS CONFLICTING EMOTIONS WHICH THESE REVELATIONS WERE CALCULATED TO CALL OUT IN ONE WHO HAD RISKED ALL ON THE HAZARD OF A DIE AND LOST SHE DID NOT EVEN KNOW AT THIS MOMENT WHETHER SHE WAS GLAD OR SORRY HE COULD EXPLAIN SO CLEVERLY
8629-261140-0043 SHE HAD NOT A PURE ENOUGH HEART TO DO SO TO HER ALL SELF SACRIFICE WAS AN ANOMALY NO WOMAN OF THE MENTAL OR PHYSICAL STRENGTH OF AGATHA WEBB WOULD PLANT A DAGGER IN HER OWN BREAST JUST TO PREVENT ANOTHER PERSON FROM COMMITTING A CRIME
8629-261140-0044 WERE HE LOVER HUSBAND OR SON SO AMABEL BELIEVED AND SO WOULD THESE OTHERS BELIEVE ALSO WHEN ONCE RELIEVED OF THE MAGNETIC PERSONALITY OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY WITNESS
8629-261140-0045 YET HOW THRILLING IT HAD BEEN TO HEAR HIM PLEAD HIS CAUSE SO WELL IT WAS ALMOST WORTH THE LOSS OF HER REVENGE TO MEET HIS LOOK OF HATE AND DREAM OF THE POSSIBILITY OF TURNING IT LATER INTO THE OLD LOOK OF LOVE YES YES SHE LOVED HIM NOW
8629-261140-0046 NOT EVEN FOR HIS MONEY FOR SHE COULD CONTEMPLATE ITS LOSS BUT FOR HIMSELF WHO HAD SO BOLDLY SHOWN THAT HE WAS STRONGER THAN SHE AND COULD TRIUMPH OVER HER BY THE SHEER FORCE OF HIS MASCULINE DARING
8629-261140-0047 WITH SUCH FEELINGS
8629-261140-0048 HOW CONDUCT HERSELF UNDER QUESTIONS WHICH WOULD BE MUCH MORE SEARCHING NOW THAN BEFORE SHE COULD NOT EVEN DECIDE IN HER OWN MIND SHE MUST LET IMPULSE HAVE ITS WAY HAPPILY SHE TOOK THE RIGHT STAND AT FIRST
8629-261140-0049 SHE DID NOT ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE ANY CORRECTIONS IN HER FORMER TESTIMONY ONLY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE FLOWER WHOSE PRESENCE ON THE SCENE OF DEATH HAD BEEN SUCH A MYSTERY HAD FALLEN FROM HER HAIR AT THE BALL AND THAT SHE HAD SEEN FREDERICK PICK IT UP AND PUT IT IN HIS BUTTONHOLE
8629-261140-0050 BEYOND THIS AND THE INFERENCES IT AFTERWARD AWAKENED IN HER MIND SHE WOULD NOT GO
8630-305212-0000 CHAPTER FIVE HOW AUGUSTINE WENT TO CARTHAGE AND HOW PATRICIUS DIED A CHRISTIAN DEATH AUGUSTINE'S YEAR AT HOME DID NOT DO FOR HIM WHAT MONICA HAD HOPED
8630-305212-0001 HIS OLD PAGAN SCHOOLFELLOWS GATHERED ROUND HIM HE WAS ALWAYS WITH THEM THE HAPPY HOME LIFE SEEMED TO HAVE LOST ITS CHARM THE WANT OF PRINCIPLE AND OF HONOUR IN MOST OF THEM
8630-305212-0002 DISGUSTED HIM IN HIS BETTER MOMENTS NEVERTHELESS HE WAS CONTENT TO ENJOY HIMSELF IN THEIR COMPANY HE WAS EVEN ASHAMED WHEN THEY BOASTED OF THEIR MISDOINGS TO SEEM MORE INNOCENT THAN THEY
8630-305212-0003 AND WOULD PRETEND TO BE WORSE THAN HE REALLY WAS LEST HIS PRESTIGE SHOULD SUFFER IN THEIR EYES THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN HE LOATHED IT ALL AND LONGED FOR THE OLD LIFE WITH ITS INNOCENT PLEASURES
8630-305212-0004 BUT IT IS HARD TO TURN BACK ON THE DOWNHILL ROAD HE TELLS US HOW HE WENT ONE NIGHT WITH A BAND OF THESE WILD COMPANIONS TO ROB THE FRUIT TREE OF A POOR NEIGHBOUR IT WAS LADEN WITH PEARS
8630-305212-0005 BUT THEY WERE NOT VERY GOOD THEY DID NOT CARE TO EAT THEM AND THREW THEM TO THE PIGS IT WAS NOT SCHOOLBOY GREED THAT PROMPTED THE THEFT BUT THE PURE DELIGHT OF DOING EVIL
8630-305212-0006 OF TRICKING THE OWNER OF THE GARDEN THERE WAS THE WILD EXCITEMENT TOO OF THE DARING THE FEAR THAT THEY MIGHT BE CAUGHT IN THE ACT HE WAS CAREFUL TO KEEP SUCH ESCAPADES A SECRET FROM HIS MOTHER BUT MONICA WAS UNEASY
8630-305212-0007 KNOWING WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM THE COMPANIONS HER SON HAD CHOSEN PATRICIUS WAS ALTOGETHER UNABLE TO GIVE AUGUSTINE THE HELP THAT HE NEEDED THE CHRISTIAN IDEALS OF LIFE AND CONDUCT WERE NEW TO HIM AS YET
8630-305212-0008 THE OLD PAGAN WAYS SEEMED ONLY NATURAL HE WAS SCARCELY LIKELY TO BE ASTONISHED AT THE FACT THAT HIS SON'S BOYHOOD WAS RATHER LIKE WHAT HIS OWN HAD BEEN HE WAS STANDING IT IS TRUE ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE CHURCH
8630-305212-0009 BUT HER TEACHING WAS NOT YET CLEAR TO HIM HIS OWN FEET WERE NOT FIRM ENOUGH IN THE WAYS OF CHRIST TO ENABLE HIM TO STRETCH A STEADYING HAND TO ANOTHER HIS MOTHER WAS FAILING FAST
8630-305212-0010 THE END COULD NOT BE FAR OFF MONICA WAS DEVOTING HERSELF HEART AND SOUL TO THE OLD WOMAN WHO CLUNG TO HER WITH TENDER AFFECTION AND WAS NEVER HAPPY IN HER ABSENCE PATRICIUS WATCHED THEM TOGETHER
8630-305212-0011 AND MARVELLED AT THE EFFECTS OF THE GRACE OF BAPTISM WAS THAT INDEED HIS MOTHER HE ASKED HIMSELF THAT GENTLE PATIENT OLD WOMAN SO THOUGHTFUL FOR OTHERS SO READY TO GIVE UP HER OWN WILL
8630-305212-0012 SHE HAD USED TO BE VIOLENT AND HEADSTRONG LIKE HIMSELF RESENTFUL AND IMPLACABLE IN HER DISLIKES BUT NOW SHE WAS MORE LIKE MONICA THAN LIKE HIM THAT WAS MONICA'S WAY THOUGH HER SWEETNESS AND PATIENCE
8630-305212-0013 SEEMED TO BE CATCHING SHE WAS LIKE THE SUNSHINE PENETRATING EVERYWHERE WITH ITS LIGHT AND WARMTH HE ALAS WAS FAR BEHIND HIS MOTHER CATECHUMEN THOUGH HE WAS THE OLD TEMPER WOULD OFTEN FLASH OUT STILL
8630-305212-0014 SELF CONQUEST WAS THE HARDEST TASK THAT HE HAD EVER UNDERTAKEN AND SOMETIMES HE ALMOST LOST HEART AND WAS INCLINED TO GIVE IT UP ALTOGETHER THEN MONICA WOULD GENTLY REMIND HIM
8630-305212-0015 THAT WITH GOD'S HELP THE HARDEST THINGS WERE POSSIBLE AND THEY WOULD KNEEL AND PRAY TOGETHER AND PATRICIUS WOULD TAKE HEART AGAIN FOR THE FIGHT SHE HAD A WONDERFUL GIFT FOR GIVING PEOPLE COURAGE PATRICIUS HAD NOTICED THAT BEFORE
8630-305212-0016 HE SUPPOSED IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS SO FULL OF SYMPATHY AND ALWAYS MADE ALLOWANCES AND THEN SHE SEEMED TO THINK TO BE SURE EVEN THAT IF ONE WENT ON TRYING FAILURES DID NOT MATTER
8630-305212-0017 GOD DID NOT MIND THEM AND THAT WAS A VERY COMFORTING REFLECTION FOR POOR WEAK PEOPLE LIKE HIMSELF TO GO ON TRYING WAS POSSIBLE EVEN FOR HIM ALTHOUGH HE KNEW HE COULD NOT ALWAYS PROMISE HIMSELF SUCCESS
8630-305212-0018 PATRICIUS WAS ANXIOUS ABOUT AUGUSTINE'S FUTURE ALL HIS EFFORTS HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN SAVING THE SUM REQUIRED FOR HIS FIRST YEAR AT CARTHAGE
8630-305212-0019 HE HAD DISCOVERED THAT IT WOULD COST A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN HE HAD AT FIRST SUPPOSED AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHERE THE MONEY WAS TO COME FROM IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT ROMANIANUS
8630-305212-0020 WHO KNEW THE POVERTY OF HIS FRIEND CAME FORWARD GENEROUSLY AND PUT HIS PURSE AT PATRICIUS'S DISPOSAL THE SUM REQUIRED WAS OFFERED WITH SUCH DELICACY THAT IT COULD NOT BE DECLINED AUGUSTINE WAS SURE TO BRING GLORY ON HIS NATIVE TOWN
8630-305212-0021 SAID ROMANIANUS IT WAS AN HONOUR TO BE ALLOWED TO HELP IN HIS EDUCATION MONICA WAS ALMOST GLAD TO SEE HER SON DEPART THE OLD BOYISH LAZINESS HAD GIVEN WAY
8630-305212-0022 TO A REAL ZEAL FOR LEARNING AND THIRST AFTER KNOWLEDGE THE IDLE LIFE AT HOME WAS CERTAINLY THE WORST THING FOR HIM HARD WORK AND THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM MIGHT STEADY HIS WILD NATURE AND BRING HIM BACK TO GOD
8630-305212-0023 IT WAS HER ONLY HOPE NOW AS WITH PRAYERS AND TEARS SHE BESOUGHT OF HIM TO WATCH OVER HER SON BUT MONICA DID NOT KNOW CARTHAGE
8630-305212-0024 IF IT WAS SECOND ONLY TO ROME FOR ITS CULTURE AND ITS SCHOOLS IT ALMOST RIVALLED ROME IN ITS CORRUPTION THERE ALL THAT WAS WORST IN THE CIVILIZATION OF THE EAST AND OF THE WEST MET AND MINGLED
8630-305212-0025 THE BLOODY COMBATS BETWEEN MEN AND BEASTS THE GLADIATORIAL SHOWS THAT DELIGHTED THE ROMANS WERE FREE TO ALL WHO CHOSE TO FREQUENT THE AMPHITHEATRE OF CARTHAGE SUCH PLAYS AS THE ROMANS DELIGHTED IN
8630-305212-0026 IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE WERE ACTED IN THE THEATRE THE HORRIBLE RITES OF THE EASTERN RELIGIONS WERE PRACTISED OPENLY THERE WAS NEITHER DISCIPLINE NOR ORDER IN THE SCHOOLS
8630-305212-0027 THE WEALTHIER STUDENTS GLORIED IN THEIR BAD REPUTATION THEY WERE YOUNG MEN OF FASHION WHO WERE CAPABLE OF ANYTHING AND WHO WERE CAREFUL TO LET OTHERS KNOW IT THEY WENT BY THE NAME OF SMASHERS OR UPSETTERS
8630-305212-0028 FROM THEIR HABIT OF RAIDING THE SCHOOLS OF PROFESSORS WHOSE TEACHING THEY DID NOT APPROVE AND BREAKING EVERYTHING ON WHICH THEY COULD LAY HANDS THEY TREATED NEW COMERS WITH COARSE BRUTALITY BUT AUGUSTINE SEEMS IN SOME MANNER
8630-305212-0029 TO HAVE ESCAPED THEIR ENMITY PERHAPS A CERTAIN DIGNITY IN THE YOUNG MAN'S BEARING OR PERHAPS HIS BRILLIANT GIFTS WON THEIR RESPECT FOR HE SURPASSED THEM ALL IN INTELLIGENCE AND SPEEDILY OUTSTRIPPED THEM IN CLASS
8630-305212-0030 AUGUSTINE WAS EAGER FOR KNOWLEDGE AND EAGER FOR ENJOYMENT HE FREQUENTED THE THEATRE HIS PLEASURE LOVING NATURE SNATCHED AT EVERYTHING THAT LIFE COULD GIVE YET HE WAS NOT HAPPY
8630-305212-0031 MY GOD HE CRIED IN LATER YEARS WITH WHAT BITTER GALL DIDST THOU IN THY GREAT MERCY SPRINKLE THOSE PLEASURES OF MINE HE COULD NOT FORGET
8630-305212-0032 PATRICIUS PRAYED WITH HER HE UNDERSTOOD AT LAST EVERY DAY THE GERMS OF A NOBLE NATURE THAT HAD LAIN SO LONG DORMANT WITHIN HIM WERE GAINING STRENGTH AND LIFE
8630-305212-0033 EVERY DAY HIS SOUL WAS OPENING MORE AND MORE TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF SPIRITUAL THINGS WHILE MONICA WATCHED THE TRANSFORMATION WITH A HEART THAT OVERFLOWED WITH GRATITUDE AND LOVE
8630-305212-0034 THE SORROWS OF THE PAST WERE ALL FORGOTTEN IN THE JOY OF THE PRESENT THAT HAPPY UNION AT THE FEET OF CHRIST THERE WAS BUT ONE CAUSE FOR SADNESS PATRICIUS'S HEALTH WAS FAILING
8630-305212-0035 HIS MOTHER HAD ALREADY SHOWN HIM THE JOYS OF A CHRISTIAN DEATHBED SHE HAD PASSED AWAY SMILING WITH THEIR HANDS IN HERS AND THE NAME OF JESUS ON HER LIPS
8630-305212-0036 THE BEAUTIFUL PRAYERS OF THE CHURCH HAD GONE DOWN WITH THE DEPARTING SOUL TO THE THRESHOLD OF THE NEW LIFE AND HAD FOLLOWED IT INTO ETERNITY SHE SEEMED CLOSE TO THEM STILL IN THE LIGHT OF THAT WONDERFUL NEW FAITH
8630-305212-0037 AND TO BE WAITING FOR THEM IN THEIR EVERLASTING HOME BUT MONICA'S HAPPINESS WAS TO BE SHORT LIVED FOR IT SEEMED THAT PATRICIUS WOULD SOON REJOIN HIS MOTHER
8630-305212-0038 HE DID NOT DECEIVE HIMSELF HE SPOKE OF HIS APPROACHING DEATH TO MONICA AND ASKED HER TO HELP HIM TO MAKE A WORTHY PREPARATION FOR BAPTISM WHICH HE DESIRED TO RECEIVE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
8630-305212-0039 WITH THE SIMPLICITY AND TRUSTFULNESS OF A CHILD HE LOOKED TO HER FOR GUIDANCE AND DID ALL THAT SHE DESIRED THE CEREMONY OVER HE TURNED TO HIS WIFE AND SMILED
8630-305212-0040 A WONDERFUL PEACE POSSESSED HIM THE OLD LIFE WITH ALL ITS STAINS HAD PASSED FROM HIM IN THOSE CLEANSING WATERS THE NEW LIFE WAS AT HAND ONCE MORE HE ASKED HER
8630-305212-0041 TO FORGIVE HIM ALL THE PAIN HE HAD CAUSED HER ALL THAT HE HAD MADE HER SUFFER NO SHE MUST NOT GRIEVE HE TOLD HER THE PARTING WOULD BE BUT FOR A LITTLE WHILE THE MEETING FOR ALL ETERNITY
8630-305212-0042 SHE HAD BEEN HIS ANGEL HE SAID HE OWED ALL HIS JOY TO HER IT WAS HER LOVE HER PATIENCE THAT HAD DONE IT ALL SHE HAD SHOWN HIM THE BEAUTY OF GOODNESS AND MADE HIM LOVE IT
8630-305212-0043 HE THANKED HER FOR ALL THAT SHE HAD BEEN TO HIM ALL THAT SHE HAD SHOWN HIM ALL THAT SHE HAD DONE FOR HIM HER TEARS FELL ON HIS FACE HER LOVING ARMS SUPPORTED HIM HER SWEET VOICE BROKEN WITH WEEPING
8630-305212-0044 SPOKE WORDS OF HOPE AND COMFORT ON THE THRESHOLD OF THAT OTHER WORLD MONICA BADE FAREWELL TO HER HUSBAND
8630-305213-0000 CHAPTER SIX HOW SAINT MONICA LIVED IN THE DAYS OF HER WIDOWHOOD AND HOW SHE PUT ALL HER TRUST IN GOD PATRICIUS HAD NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF WORLDLY GOODS TO LEAVE TO HIS WIFE
8630-305213-0001 SHE NEEDED LITTLE IT IS TRUE FOR HERSELF BUT THERE WAS AUGUSTINE WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR HER EVEN IF SHE PRACTISED THE STRICTEST ECONOMY TO KEEP HIM AT CARTHAGE WHERE HE WAS DOING SO WELL
8630-305213-0002 ROMANIANUS DIVINED HER ANXIETY AND HASTENED TO SET IT AT REST HE HAD A HOUSE IN CARTHAGE HE SAID IT SHOULD BE AUGUSTINE'S AS LONG AS HE REQUIRED IT
8630-305213-0003 THIS WOULD SETTLE THE QUESTION OF LODGING FOR THE REST CONTINUED ROMANIANUS AS AN OLD FRIEND OF PATRICIUS HE HAD THE RIGHT TO BEFRIEND HIS SON AND MONICA MUST GRANT HIM THE PRIVILEGE
8630-305213-0004 OF ACTING A FATHER'S PART TO AUGUSTINE UNTIL HE WAS FAIRLY LAUNCHED IN LIFE HE HAD A CHILD OF HIS OWN
8630-305213-0005 IF MONICA WOULD BEFRIEND HIS BOY THEY WOULD BE QUITS THE GRATITUDE OF BOTH MOTHER AND SON TOWARDS THIS GENEROUS FRIEND AND BENEFACTOR LASTED THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES
8630-305213-0006 YOU IT WAS ROMANIANUS WROTE AUGUSTINE IN HIS CONFESSIONS WHO WHEN I WAS A POOR YOUNG STUDENT IN CARTHAGE OPENED TO ME YOUR HOUSE YOUR PURSE AND STILL MORE YOUR HEART
8630-305213-0007 YOU IT WAS WHO WHEN I HAD THE SORROW TO LOSE MY FATHER COMFORTED ME BY YOUR FRIENDSHIP HELPED ME WITH YOUR ADVICE AND ASSISTED ME WITH YOUR FORTUNE
8630-305213-0008 MONICA MOURNED HER HUSBAND'S DEATH WITH TRUE DEVOTION BUT HERS WAS NOT A SELFISH SORROW SHE HAD LOVE AND SYMPATHY FOR ALL WHO NEEDED THEM
8630-305213-0009 AND FORGOT HER OWN GRIEF IN SOLACING THAT OF OTHERS THERE WERE CERTAIN GOOD WORKS WHICH THE CHURCH GAVE TO CHRISTIAN WIDOWS TO PERFORM THE HOSPITALS FOR INSTANCE WERE ENTIRELY IN THEIR HANDS
8630-305213-0010 THEY WERE SMALL AS YET BUILT ACCORDING TO THE NEEDS OF THE MOMENT FROM THE FUNDS OF THE FAITHFUL AND HELD BUT FEW PATIENTS THESE DEVOTED WOMEN SUCCEEDED EACH OTHER AT INTERVALS
8630-305213-0011 IN THEIR TASK OF WASHING AND ATTENDING TO THE SICK WATCHING BY THEIR BEDS AND CLEANING THEIR ROOMS THEIR MINISTRATIONS DID NOT EVEN CEASE THERE WITH REVERENT CARE THEY PREPARED THE DEAD FOR BURIAL
8630-305213-0012 THINKING THE WHILE OF THE PREPARATION OF CHRIST'S BODY FOR THE TOMB AND OF HIM WHO SAID INASMUCH AS YE DO IT TO THE LEAST OF MY BRETHREN YE DO IT UNTO ME
8630-305213-0013 IT WAS A HAPPY MOMENT FOR MONICA WHEN HER TURN CAME TO SERVE THE SICK SHE WOULD KISS THEIR SORES FOR VERY PITY AS SHE WASHED AND DRESSED THEM AND THEIR FACES GREW BRIGHT AT HER COMING
8630-305213-0014 THEY CALLED HER MOTHER IT SEEMED SUCH A NATURAL NAME TO GIVE HER FOR SHE WAS A MOTHER TO THEM ALL AND GAVE THEM A MOTHER'S LOVE TO SOME OF THE POOR CREATURES FRIENDLESS SLAVES AS THEY OFTEN WERE
8630-305213-0015 WHO HAD KNOWN LITTLE SYMPATHY OR TENDERNESS IN THEIR HARD LIVES IT WAS A REVELATION OF CHRISTIANITY WHICH TAUGHT THEM MORE THAN HOURS OF PREACHING COULD HAVE DONE BUT THERE WAS OTHER WORK BESIDES THAT AT THE HOSPITAL
8630-305213-0016 THERE WERE THE POOR TO BE HELPED THE HUNGRY TO BE FED THE NAKED TO BE CLOTHED SHE WOULD GATHER THE ORPHAN CHILDREN AT HER KNEE TO TEACH THEM THE TRUTHS OF THEIR FAITH WHEN THEY WERE VERY POOR
8630-305213-0017 SHE WOULD KEEP THEM IN HER OWN HOUSE FEED THEM AT HER OWN TABLE AND CLOTHE THEM WITH HER OWN HANDS IF I AM A MOTHER TO THESE MOTHERLESS ONES SHE WOULD SAY TO HERSELF HE WILL HAVE MERCY AND GIVE ME BACK MY BOY
8630-305213-0018 IF I TEACH THEM TO KNOW AND LOVE HIM AS A FATHER HE WILL WATCH OVER MY SON IT WAS A CUSTOM OF THE TIME ON THE FEASTS OF SAINTS AND MARTYRS TO MAKE A PILGRIMAGE TO THEIR TOMBS
8630-305213-0019 WITH A LITTLE BASKET OF FOOD AND WINE THIS WAS LAID ON THE GRAVE AFTER WHICH THE FAITHFUL WOULD PARTAKE OF WHAT THEY HAD BROUGHT WHILE THEY THOUGHT AND SPOKE OF THE NOBLE LIVES OF GOD'S SERVANTS WHO HAD GONE BEFORE
8630-305213-0020 THE CUSTOM WAS ABOLISHED NOT LONG AFTER ON ACCOUNT OF THE ABUSES WHICH HAD ARISEN BUT MONICA OBSERVED IT TO THE END SHE SCARCELY TASTED OF HER OFFERING HERSELF
8630-305213-0021 BUT GAVE IT ALL AWAY TO THE POOR OFTEN INDEED SHE WENT COLD AND HUNGRY THAT THEY MIGHT BE CLOTHED AND FED HER LOVE OF PRAYER TOO COULD NOW FIND FULL SCOPE
8630-305213-0022 EVERY MORNING FOUND HER IN HER PLACE IN CHURCH FOR THE HOLY SACRIFICE EVERY EVENING SHE WAS THERE AGAIN SILENT ABSORBED IN GOD THE PLACE WHERE SHE KNELT WAS OFTEN WET WITH HER TEARS
8630-305213-0023 THE TIME PASSED BY UNHEEDED PATRICIUS HER HUSBAND WAS SAFE IN GOD'S HANDS BUT AUGUSTINE HER ELDEST BORN HER DARLING IN WHAT DARK PATHS WAS HE WANDERING
8630-305213-0024 AND YET IN HER HEART OF HEARTS THERE WAS A DEEP CONVICTION THAT NO SAD NEWS OF HIS LIFE AT CARTHAGE COULD SHAKE HIS WAS NOT THE NATURE TO FIND CONTENTMENT IN THE THINGS OF EARTH
8630-305213-0025 HE WAS BORN TO SOMETHING HIGHER HIS NOBLE HEART HIS STRONG INTELLIGENCE WOULD BRING HIM BACK TO GOD AND YET AND YET
8630-305213-0026 HER HEART SANK AS SHE THOUGHT OF GRACES WASTED OF CONSCIENCE TRAMPLED UNDERFOOT OF LIGHT REJECTED NO THERE WAS NO HOPE ANYWHERE BUT WITH GOD IN HIM SHE WOULD TRUST AND IN HIM ALONE
8630-305213-0027 HE WAS INFINITE IN MERCY AND STRONG TO SAVE HE HAD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD NEVER FAIL THOSE WHO PUT THEIR TRUST IN HIM AT HIS FEET AND AT HIS FEET ALONE
8630-305213-0028 MONICA POURED OUT HER TEARS AND HER SORROW WITH OTHERS SHE WAS SERENE AND HOPEFUL AS OF OLD EVEN JOYOUS ALWAYS READY TO HELP AND COMFORT IT WAS SAID OF HER AFTER HER DEATH
8630-305213-0029 THAT NO ONE HAD SUCH A GIFT OF HELPING OTHERS AS SHE SHE NEVER PREACHED AT PEOPLE MOST PEOPLE HAVE AN INSURMOUNTABLE DISLIKE TO BEING PREACHED AT BUT EVERY WORD SHE SAID HAD A STRANGE POWER OF DRAWING SOULS TO GOD
8630-305213-0030 OF MAKING THEM WISH TO BE BETTER AUGUSTINE MEANWHILE AT CARTHAGE WAS JUSTIFYING ALL THE HOPES THAT HAD BEEN FORMED OF HIM HE HAD EVEN GREATER GIFTS IT SEEMED THAN ELOQUENCE FEELING AND WIT
8630-305213-0031 HE WAS AT THE HEAD OF HIS CLASS IN RHETORIC HIS MASTER HAD SPOKEN TO HIM OF A CERTAIN TREATISE OF ARISTOTLE WHICH HE WOULD SOON BE CALLED UPON TO STUDY IT WAS SO PROFOUND HE SAID THAT FEW COULD UNDERSTAND IT
8630-305213-0032 EVEN WITH THE HELP OF THE MOST LEARNED PROFESSORS AUGUSTINE EAGER TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THIS WONDERFUL WORK PROCURED IT AT ONCE AND READ IT IT SEEMED TO HIM PERFECTLY SIMPLE IT WAS UNNECESSARY HE FOUND
8630-305213-0033 TO ASK A SINGLE EXPLANATION IT WAS THE SAME WITH GEOMETRY MUSIC EVERY SCIENCE HE TOOK UP THIS YOUNG GENIUS OF NINETEEN ONLY DISCOVERED THERE WERE DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY
8630-305213-0034 WHEN HE HAD TO TEACH OTHERS AND REALIZED HOW HARD IT WAS TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS SO EXCEEDINGLY SIMPLE TO HIMSELF THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGELY SYMPATHETIC AND ATTRACTIVE ABOUT AUGUSTINE
8630-305213-0035 HE SEEMED MODEST AND RESERVED ABOUT HIS OWN GIFTS ALTHOUGH HE HIMSELF TELLS US IN HIS CONFESSIONS THAT HE WAS FULL OF PRIDE AND AMBITION HE HAD A GIFT OF MAKING TRUE AND FAITHFUL FRIENDS A CHARM IN CONVERSATION
8630-305213-0036 THAT DREW HIS YOUNG COMPANIONS AND EVEN OLDER MEN TO HIS SIDE A MORE WORLDLY MOTHER THAN MONICA WOULD HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY PROUD OF HER SON FAITH AND VIRTUE WERE ALONE WEAK AND FAINT IN THAT SOUL
8630-305213-0037 THAT COULD SO ILL DO WITHOUT THEM BUT TO HER THEY WERE THE ONE ESSENTIAL THING THE REST DID NOT MATTER YET MONICA WITH TRUE INSIGHT BELIEVED THAT WITH NOBLE MINDS KNOWLEDGE MUST DRAW MEN TO GOD
8630-305213-0038 SHE HOPED MUCH THEREFORE THAT AUGUSTINE'S BRILLIANCE OF INTELLECT WOULD SAVE HIM IN THE END AND HER HOPES WERE NOT DECEIVED ALREADY THE NOBLE PHILOSOPHY OF CICERO
8630-305213-0039 PAGAN THOUGH HE WAS HAD AWAKENED A THIRST FOR WISDOM IN THE YOUNG STUDENT'S SOUL ALREADY HE FELT THE EMPTINESS OF EARTHLY JOYS I LONGED MY GOD HE WRITES
8630-305213-0040 AND I KNEW NOT THAT IT WAS THOU THAT WAST WORKING IN ME ONE THING COOLED MY ARDOUR HE GOES ON TO SAY IT WAS THAT THE NAME OF CHRIST WAS NOT THERE AND THIS NAME BY THY MERCY LORD
8630-305213-0041 OF THY SON MY SAVIOUR MY HEART HAD DRAWN IN WITH MY MOTHER'S MILK AND KEPT IN ITS DEPTHS AND EVERY DOCTRINE WHERE THIS NAME DID NOT APPEAR FLUENT ELEGANT AND TRUTH LIKE THOUGH IT MIGHT BE
8630-305213-0042 COULD NOT MASTER ME ALTOGETHER HE THEN TURNED TO THE HOLY SCRIPTURES BUT THEY APPEARED TO HIM INFERIOR IN STYLE TO CICERO MY PRIDE HE WRITES
8630-305213-0043 DESPISED THE MANNER IN WHICH THE THINGS ARE SAID AND MY INTELLIGENCE COULD NOT DISCOVER THE HIDDEN SENSE
8630-305213-0044 AND I DISDAINED TO HUMBLE MYSELF AND INFLATED WITH VAINGLORY I BELIEVED MYSELF GREAT IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT HE CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE MANICHEANS WHOSE ERRORS ATTRACTED HIM AT ONCE
8630-305213-0045 THIS EXTRAORDINARY HERESY HAD BEGUN IN THE EAST AND HAD SPREAD ALL OVER THE CIVILIZED WORLD ITS FOLLOWERS FORMED A SECRET SOCIETY WITH SIGNS AND PASSWORDS GRADES AND INITIATIONS
8630-305213-0046 TO IMPOSE ON CHRISTIANS THEY USED CHRISTIAN WORDS FOR DOCTRINES THAT WERE THOROUGHLY UNCHRISTIAN PERHAPS THE MOST REMARKABLE THING ABOUT THEM WAS THEIR HATRED OF THE CHURCH AUGUSTINE
8630-305213-0047 WHO REMAINED AMONGST THEM FOR NINE YEARS THUS DESCRIBES THEM WHEN WRITING TO A FRIEND THOU KNOWEST HONORATUS THAT FOR THIS REASON ALONE DID WE FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THESE MEN
8630-305213-0048 NAMELY THAT THEY PROFESSED TO FREE US FROM ALL ERRORS AND BRING US TO GOD BY PURE REASON ALONE WITHOUT THAT TERRIBLE PRINCIPLE OF AUTHORITY FOR WHAT ELSE INDUCED ME TO ABANDON THE FAITH OF MY CHILDHOOD
8630-305213-0049 AND FOLLOW THESE MEN FOR ALMOST NINE YEARS BUT THEIR ASSERTION THAT WE WERE TERRIFIED BY SUPERSTITION INTO A FAITH BLINDLY IMPOSED UPON OUR REASON WHILE THEY URGED NO ONE TO BELIEVE
8630-305213-0050 UNTIL THE TRUTH WAS FULLY DISCUSSED AND PROVED WHO WOULD NOT BE SEDUCED BY SUCH PROMISES ESPECIALLY IF HE WERE A PROUD CONTENTIOUS YOUNG MAN THIRSTING FOR TRUTH SUCH AS THEY THEN FOUND ME
8630-305213-0051 THAT WAS WHAT THE MANICHEANS PROMISED WHAT AUGUSTINE FOUND AMONGST THEM HE ALSO TELLS US THEY INCESSANTLY REPEATED TO ME TRUTH TRUTH BUT THERE WAS NO TRUTH IN THEM
8630-305213-0052 THEY TAUGHT WHAT WAS FALSE NOT ONLY ABOUT THEE MY GOD WHO ART THE VERY TRUTH BUT EVEN ABOUT THE ELEMENTS OF THIS WORLD THY CREATURES SO MUCH FOR THEIR DOCTRINES AS FOR THE TEACHERS THEMSELVES
8630-305213-0053 HE FOUND THEM CARNAL AND LOQUACIOUS FULL OF INSANE PRIDE THE GREAT CHARM OF MANICHEISM TO AUGUSTINE WAS THAT IT TAUGHT THAT A MAN WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS SINS THIS DOCTRINE WAS CONVENIENT TO ONE
8630-305213-0054 WHO COULD NOT FIND THE STRENGTH TO BREAK WITH HIS BAD HABITS SUCH WAS MY MIND HE SUMS UP LATER LOOKING BACK ON THIS PERIOD OF HIS LIFE SO WEIGHED DOWN SO BLINDED BY THE FLESH
87-121553-0000 AND IN ITS GYRE HAD NOT TURNED WHOLLY ROUND BEFORE ANOTHER IN A RING ENCLOSED IT AND MOTION JOINED TO MOTION SONG TO SONG SONG THAT AS GREATLY DOTH TRANSCEND OUR MUSES OUR SIRENS IN THOSE DULCET CLARIONS AS PRIMAL SPLENDOUR THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED
87-121553-0001 WHEN JUNO TO HER HANDMAID GIVES COMMAND THE ONE WITHOUT BORN OF THE ONE WITHIN LIKE TO THE SPEAKING OF THAT VAGRANT ONE WHOM LOVE CONSUMED AS DOTH THE SUN THE VAPOURS
87-121553-0002 AFTER THE DANCE AND OTHER GRAND REJOICINGS BOTH OF THE SINGING AND THE FLAMING FORTH EFFULGENCE WITH EFFULGENCE BLITHE AND TENDER TOGETHER AT ONCE WITH ONE ACCORD HAD STOPPED EVEN AS THE EYES THAT AS VOLITION MOVES THEM MUST NEEDS TOGETHER SHUT AND LIFT THEMSELVES
87-121553-0003 OUT OF THE HEART OF ONE OF THE NEW LIGHTS THERE CAME A VOICE THAT NEEDLE TO THE STAR MADE ME APPEAR IN TURNING THITHERWARD AND IT BEGAN THE LOVE THAT MAKES ME FAIR DRAWS ME TO SPEAK ABOUT THE OTHER LEADER BY WHOM SO WELL IS SPOKEN HERE OF MINE
87-121553-0004 TIS RIGHT WHERE ONE IS TO BRING IN THE OTHER THAT AS THEY WERE UNITED IN THEIR WARFARE TOGETHER LIKEWISE MAY THEIR GLORY SHINE THE SOLDIERY OF CHRIST WHICH IT HAD COST SO DEAR TO ARM AGAIN BEHIND THE STANDARD MOVED SLOW AND DOUBTFUL AND IN NUMBERS FEW
87-121553-0005 WHEN THE EMPEROR WHO REIGNETH EVERMORE PROVIDED FOR THE HOST THAT WAS IN PERIL THROUGH GRACE ALONE AND NOT THAT IT WAS WORTHY AND AS WAS SAID HE TO HIS BRIDE BROUGHT SUCCOUR WITH CHAMPIONS TWAIN AT WHOSE DEED AT WHOSE WORD THE STRAGGLING PEOPLE WERE TOGETHER DRAWN
87-121553-0006 WITHIN THAT REGION WHERE THE SWEET WEST WIND RISES TO OPEN THE NEW LEAVES WHEREWITH EUROPE IS SEEN TO CLOTHE HERSELF AFRESH NOT FAR OFF FROM THE BEATING OF THE WAVES BEHIND WHICH IN HIS LONG CAREER THE SUN SOMETIMES CONCEALS HIMSELF FROM EVERY MAN
87-121553-0007 IS SITUATE THE FORTUNATE CALAHORRA UNDER PROTECTION OF THE MIGHTY SHIELD IN WHICH THE LION SUBJECT IS AND SOVEREIGN THEREIN WAS BORN THE AMOROUS PARAMOUR OF CHRISTIAN FAITH THE ATHLETE CONSECRATE KIND TO HIS OWN AND CRUEL TO HIS FOES
87-121553-0008 AND WHEN IT WAS CREATED WAS HIS MIND REPLETE WITH SUCH A LIVING ENERGY THAT IN HIS MOTHER HER IT MADE PROPHETIC AS SOON AS THE ESPOUSALS WERE COMPLETE BETWEEN HIM AND THE FAITH AT HOLY FONT WHERE THEY WITH MUTUAL SAFETY DOWERED EACH OTHER
87-121553-0009 THE WOMAN WHO FOR HIM HAD GIVEN ASSENT SAW IN A DREAM THE ADMIRABLE FRUIT THAT ISSUE WOULD FROM HIM AND FROM HIS HEIRS AND THAT HE MIGHT BE CONSTRUED AS HE WAS A SPIRIT FROM THIS PLACE WENT FORTH TO NAME HIM WITH HIS POSSESSIVE WHOSE HE WHOLLY WAS
87-121553-0010 DOMINIC WAS HE CALLED AND HIM I SPEAK OF EVEN AS OF THE HUSBANDMAN WHOM CHRIST ELECTED TO HIS GARDEN TO ASSIST HIM ENVOY AND SERVANT SOOTH HE SEEMED OF CHRIST FOR THE FIRST LOVE MADE MANIFEST IN HIM WAS THE FIRST COUNSEL THAT WAS GIVEN BY CHRIST
87-121553-0011 SILENT AND WAKEFUL MANY A TIME WAS HE DISCOVERED BY HIS NURSE UPON THE GROUND AS IF HE WOULD HAVE SAID FOR THIS I CAME O THOU HIS FATHER FELIX VERILY O THOU HIS MOTHER VERILY JOANNA IF THIS INTERPRETED MEANS AS IS SAID
87-121553-0012 NOT FOR THE WORLD WHICH PEOPLE TOIL FOR NOW IN FOLLOWING OSTIENSE AND TADDEO BUT THROUGH HIS LONGING AFTER THE TRUE MANNA HE IN SHORT TIME BECAME SO GREAT A TEACHER THAT HE BEGAN TO GO ABOUT THE VINEYARD WHICH FADETH SOON IF FAITHLESS BE THE DRESSER
87-121553-0013 NOT THROUGH ITSELF BUT HIM WHO SITS THERE AND DEGENERATES NOT TO DISPENSE OR TWO OR THREE FOR SIX NOT ANY FORTUNE OF FIRST VACANCY NON DECIMAS QUAE SUNT PAUPERUM DEI
87-121553-0014 HE ASKED FOR BUT AGAINST THE ERRANT WORLD PERMISSION TO DO BATTLE FOR THE SEED OF WHICH THESE FOUR AND TWENTY PLANTS SURROUND THEE THEN WITH THE DOCTRINE AND THE WILL TOGETHER WITH OFFICE APOSTOLICAL HE MOVED LIKE TORRENT WHICH SOME LOFTY VEIN OUT PRESSES
87-121553-0015 AND IN AMONG THE SHOOTS HERETICAL HIS IMPETUS WITH GREATER FURY SMOTE WHEREVER THE RESISTANCE WAS THE GREATEST OF HIM WERE MADE THEREAFTER DIVERS RUNNELS WHEREBY THE GARDEN CATHOLIC IS WATERED SO THAT MORE LIVING ITS PLANTATIONS STAND
87-121553-0016 IN WHICH THE HOLY CHURCH ITSELF DEFENDED AND IN THE FIELD ITS CIVIC BATTLE WON TRULY FULL MANIFEST SHOULD BE TO THEE THE EXCELLENCE OF THE OTHER UNTO WHOM THOMAS SO COURTEOUS WAS BEFORE MY COMING
87-121553-0017 BUT STILL THE ORBIT WHICH THE HIGHEST PART OF ITS CIRCUMFERENCE MADE IS DERELICT SO THAT THE MOULD IS WHERE WAS ONCE THE CRUST HIS FAMILY THAT HAD STRAIGHT FORWARD MOVED WITH FEET UPON HIS FOOTPRINTS ARE TURNED ROUND SO THAT THEY SET THE POINT UPON THE HEEL
87-121553-0018 I AM AS I AM WONT TWILL NOT BE FROM CASAL NOR ACQUASPARTA FROM WHENCE COME SUCH UNTO THE WRITTEN WORD THAT ONE AVOIDS IT AND THE OTHER NARROWS
87-121553-0019 WHO ALWAYS IN GREAT OFFICES POSTPONED CONSIDERATIONS SINISTER HERE ARE ILLUMINATO AND AGOSTINO WHO OF THE FIRST BAREFOOTED BEGGARS WERE THAT WITH THE CORD THE FRIENDS OF GOD BECAME HUGH OF SAINT VICTOR IS AMONG THEM HERE
87-121553-0020 AND PETER MANGIADOR AND PETER OF SPAIN WHO DOWN BELOW IN VOLUMES TWELVE IS SHINING NATHAN THE SEER AND METROPOLITAN CHRYSOSTOM
87-121553-0021 HERE IS RABANUS AND BESIDE ME HERE SHINES THE CALABRIAN ABBOT JOACHIM HE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY ENDOWED TO CELEBRATE SO GREAT A PALADIN HAVE MOVED ME THE IMPASSIONED COURTESY AND THE DISCREET DISCOURSES OF FRIAR THOMAS
87-121553-0022 LET HIM IMAGINE WHO WOULD WELL CONCEIVE WHAT NOW I SAW AND LET HIM WHILE I SPEAK RETAIN THE IMAGE AS A STEADFAST ROCK THE FIFTEEN STARS THAT IN THEIR DIVERS REGIONS THE SKY ENLIVEN WITH A LIGHT SO GREAT
87-121553-0023 THAT IN THE POINT BEGINNETH OF THE AXIS ROUND ABOUT WHICH THE PRIMAL WHEEL REVOLVES TO HAVE FASHIONED OF THEMSELVES TWO SIGNS IN HEAVEN
87-121553-0024 THE MOMENT WHEN SHE FELT THE FROST OF DEATH AND ONE TO HAVE ITS RAYS WITHIN THE OTHER AND BOTH TO WHIRL THEMSELVES IN SUCH A MANNER THAT ONE SHOULD FORWARD GO THE OTHER BACKWARD
87-121553-0025 AND HE WILL HAVE SOME SHADOWING FORTH OF THAT TRUE CONSTELLATION AND THE DOUBLE DANCE THAT CIRCLED ROUND THE POINT AT WHICH I WAS BECAUSE IT IS AS MUCH BEYOND OUR WONT AS SWIFTER THAN THE MOTION OF THE CHIANA MOVETH THE HEAVEN THAT ALL THE REST OUTSPEEDS
87-121553-0026 THEN BROKE THE SILENCE OF THOSE SAINTS CONCORDANT THE LIGHT IN WHICH THE ADMIRABLE LIFE OF GOD'S OWN MENDICANT WAS TOLD TO ME AND SAID
87-121553-0027 THAT IT WEIGHS DOWN THE BALANCE OF ALL SIN WHATE'ER OF LIGHT IT HAS TO HUMAN NATURE BEEN LAWFUL TO POSSESS WAS ALL INFUSED BY THE SAME POWER THAT BOTH OF THEM CREATED AND HENCE AT WHAT I SAID ABOVE DOST WONDER
87-121553-0028 WHEN I NARRATED THAT NO SECOND HAD THE GOOD WHICH IN THE FIFTH LIGHT IS ENCLOSED NOW OPE THINE EYES TO WHAT I ANSWER THEE AND THOU SHALT SEE THY CREED AND MY DISCOURSE FIT IN THE TRUTH AS CENTRE IN A CIRCLE THAT WHICH CAN DIE
87-121553-0029 AND THAT WHICH DIETH NOT ARE NOTHING BUT THE SPLENDOUR OF THE IDEA WHICH BY HIS LOVE OUR LORD BRINGS INTO BEING BECAUSE THAT LIVING LIGHT WHICH FROM ITS FOUNT EFFULGENT FLOWS SO THAT IT DISUNITES NOT FROM HIM NOR FROM THE LOVE IN THEM INTRINED
87-121553-0030 ITSELF ETERNALLY REMAINING ONE THENCE IT DESCENDS TO THE LAST POTENCIES DOWNWARD FROM ACT TO ACT BECOMING SUCH THAT ONLY BRIEF CONTINGENCIES IT MAKES AND THESE CONTINGENCIES I HOLD TO BE THINGS GENERATED
87-121553-0031 WHICH THE HEAVEN PRODUCES BY ITS OWN MOTION WITH SEED AND WITHOUT NEITHER THEIR WAX NOR THAT WHICH TEMPERS IT REMAINS IMMUTABLE AND HENCE BENEATH THE IDEAL SIGNET MORE AND LESS SHINES THROUGH THEREFORE IT HAPPENS THAT THE SELFSAME TREE
87-121553-0032 AFTER ITS KIND BEARS WORSE AND BETTER FRUIT AND YE ARE BORN WITH CHARACTERS DIVERSE IF IN PERFECTION TEMPERED WERE THE WAX AND WERE THE HEAVEN IN ITS SUPREMEST VIRTUE THE BRILLIANCE OF THE SEAL WOULD ALL APPEAR BUT NATURE GIVES IT EVERMORE DEFICIENT
87-121553-0033 IN THE LIKE MANNER WORKING AS THE ARTIST WHO HAS THE SKILL OF ART AND HAND THAT TREMBLES IF THEN THE FERVENT LOVE THE VISION CLEAR OF PRIMAL VIRTUE DO DISPOSE AND SEAL PERFECTION ABSOLUTE IS THERE ACQUIRED
87-121553-0034 NOW IF NO FARTHER FORTH I SHOULD PROCEED THEN IN WHAT WAY WAS HE WITHOUT A PEER
87-121553-0035 THINK WHO HE WAS AND WHAT OCCASION MOVED HIM TO MAKE REQUEST WHEN IT WAS TOLD HIM ASK I'VE NOT SO SPOKEN THAT THOU CANST NOT SEE CLEARLY HE WAS A KING WHO ASKED FOR WISDOM THAT HE MIGHT BE SUFFICIENTLY A KING TWAS NOT TO KNOW THE NUMBER IN WHICH ARE THE MOTORS HERE ABOVE
87-121553-0036 OR IF IN SEMICIRCLE CAN BE MADE TRIANGLE SO THAT IT HAVE NO RIGHT ANGLE WHENCE IF THOU NOTEST THIS AND WHAT I SAID A REGAL PRUDENCE IS THAT PEERLESS SEEING IN WHICH THE SHAFT OF MY INTENTION STRIKES AND IF ON ROSE THOU TURNEST THY CLEAR EYES
87-121553-0037 AND THE GOOD ARE RARE WITH THIS DISTINCTION TAKE THOU WHAT I SAID AND THUS IT CAN CONSIST WITH THY BELIEF OF THE FIRST FATHER AND OF OUR DELIGHT AND LEAD SHALL THIS BE ALWAYS TO THY FEET TO MAKE THEE LIKE A WEARY MAN MOVE SLOWLY
87-121553-0038 BOTH TO THE YES AND NO THOU SEEST NOT FOR VERY LOW AMONG THE FOOLS IS HE WHO AFFIRMS WITHOUT DISTINCTION OR DENIES AS WELL IN ONE AS IN THE OTHER CASE BECAUSE IT HAPPENS THAT FULL OFTEN BENDS CURRENT OPINION IN THE FALSE DIRECTION
87-121553-0039 AND THEN THE FEELINGS BIND THE INTELLECT FAR MORE THAN USELESSLY HE LEAVES THE SHORE SINCE HE RETURNETH NOT THE SAME HE WENT WHO FISHES FOR THE TRUTH AND HAS NO SKILL
87-121553-0040 THUS DID SABELLIUS ARIUS AND THOSE FOOLS WHO HAVE BEEN EVEN AS SWORDS UNTO THE SCRIPTURES IN RENDERING DISTORTED THEIR STRAIGHT FACES NOR YET SHALL PEOPLE BE TOO CONFIDENT IN JUDGING EVEN AS HE IS WHO DOTH COUNT THE CORN IN FIELD OR EVER IT BE RIPE
87-121553-0041 FOR I HAVE SEEN ALL WINTER LONG THE THORN FIRST SHOW ITSELF INTRACTABLE AND FIERCE AND AFTER BEAR THE ROSE UPON ITS TOP AND I HAVE SEEN A SHIP DIRECT AND SWIFT RUN O'ER THE SEA THROUGHOUT ITS COURSE ENTIRE TO PERISH AT THE HARBOUR'S MOUTH AT LAST
87-121553-0042 AS FROM WITHOUT TIS STRUCK OR FROM WITHIN INTO MY MIND UPON A SUDDEN DROPPED WHAT I AM SAYING AT THE MOMENT WHEN SILENT BECAME THE GLORIOUS LIFE OF THOMAS BECAUSE OF THE RESEMBLANCE THAT WAS BORN OF HIS DISCOURSE AND THAT OF BEATRICE WHOM AFTER HIM IT PLEASED THUS TO BEGIN
87-121553-0043 THIS MAN HAS NEED AND DOES NOT TELL YOU SO NOR WITH THE VOICE NOR EVEN IN HIS THOUGHT OF GOING TO THE ROOT OF ONE TRUTH MORE DECLARE UNTO HIM IF THE LIGHT WHEREWITH BLOSSOMS YOUR SUBSTANCE SHALL REMAIN WITH YOU ETERNALLY THE SAME THAT IT IS NOW
87-121553-0044 AND IF IT DO REMAIN SAY IN WHAT MANNER AFTER YE ARE AGAIN MADE VISIBLE IT CAN BE THAT IT INJURE NOT YOUR SIGHT AS BY A GREATER GLADNESS URGED AND DRAWN THEY WHO ARE DANCING IN A RING SOMETIMES UPLIFT THEIR VOICES AND THEIR MOTIONS QUICKEN
87-121553-0045 SO AT THAT ORISON DEVOUT AND PROMPT THE HOLY CIRCLES A NEW JOY DISPLAYED IN THEIR REVOLVING AND THEIR WONDROUS SONG WHOSO LAMENTETH HIM THAT HERE WE DIE THAT WE MAY LIVE ABOVE HAS NEVER THERE SEEN THE REFRESHMENT OF THE ETERNAL RAIN
87-121553-0046 THE ONE AND TWO AND THREE WHO EVER LIVETH AND REIGNETH EVER IN THREE AND TWO AND ONE NOT CIRCUMSCRIBED AND ALL THINGS CIRCUMSCRIBING THREE SEVERAL TIMES WAS CHANTED BY EACH ONE AMONG THOSE SPIRITS WITH SUCH MELODY THAT FOR ALL MERIT IT WERE JUST REWARD
87-121553-0047 ITS BRIGHTNESS IS PROPORTIONED TO THE ARDOUR THE ARDOUR TO THE VISION AND THE VISION EQUALS WHAT GRACE IT HAS ABOVE ITS WORTH WHEN GLORIOUS AND SANCTIFIED OUR FLESH IS REASSUMED THEN SHALL OUR PERSONS BE MORE PLEASING BY THEIR BEING ALL COMPLETE
87-121553-0048 FOR WILL INCREASE WHATE'ER BESTOWS ON US OF LIGHT GRATUITOUS THE GOOD SUPREME LIGHT WHICH ENABLES US TO LOOK ON HIM THEREFORE THE VISION MUST PERFORCE INCREASE INCREASE THE ARDOUR WHICH FROM THAT IS KINDLED INCREASE THE RADIANCE WHICH FROM THIS PROCEEDS
87-121553-0049 NOR CAN SO GREAT A SPLENDOUR WEARY US FOR STRONG WILL BE THE ORGANS OF THE BODY TO EVERYTHING WHICH HATH THE POWER TO PLEASE US SO SUDDEN AND ALERT APPEARED TO ME BOTH ONE AND THE OTHER CHOIR TO SAY AMEN THAT WELL THEY SHOWED DESIRE FOR THEIR DEAD BODIES
87-121553-0050 NOR SOLE FOR THEM PERHAPS BUT FOR THE MOTHERS THE FATHERS AND THE REST WHO HAD BEEN DEAR OR EVER THEY BECAME ETERNAL FLAMES AND LO ALL ROUND ABOUT OF EQUAL BRIGHTNESS AROSE A LUSTRE OVER WHAT WAS THERE LIKE AN HORIZON THAT IS CLEARING UP
87-121553-0051 SO THAT THE SIGHT SEEMS REAL AND UNREAL IT SEEMED TO ME THAT NEW SUBSISTENCES BEGAN THERE TO BE SEEN AND MAKE A CIRCLE OUTSIDE THE OTHER TWO CIRCUMFERENCES O VERY SPARKLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT HOW SUDDEN AND INCANDESCENT IT BECAME UNTO MINE EYES THAT VANQUISHED BORE IT NOT
87-121553-0052 BUT BEATRICE SO BEAUTIFUL AND SMILING APPEARED TO ME THAT WITH THE OTHER SIGHTS THAT FOLLOWED NOT MY MEMORY I MUST LEAVE HER THEN TO UPLIFT THEMSELVES MINE EYES RESUMED THE POWER AND I BEHELD MYSELF TRANSLATED TO HIGHER SALVATION WITH MY LADY ONLY
87-121553-0053 WELL WAS I WARE THAT I WAS MORE UPLIFTED BY THE ENKINDLED SMILING OF THE STAR THAT SEEMED TO ME MORE RUDDY THAN ITS WONT WITH ALL MY HEART AND IN THAT DIALECT WHICH IS THE SAME IN ALL SUCH HOLOCAUST TO GOD I MADE AS THE NEW GRACE BESEEMED
87-121553-0054 AND NOT YET FROM MY BOSOM WAS EXHAUSTED THE ARDOUR OF SACRIFICE BEFORE I KNEW THIS OFFERING WAS ACCEPTED AND AUSPICIOUS FOR WITH SO GREAT A LUSTRE AND SO RED SPLENDOURS APPEARED TO ME IN TWOFOLD RAYS I SAID O HELIOS WHO DOST SO ADORN THEM
87-121553-0055 EVEN AS DISTINCT WITH LESS AND GREATER LIGHTS GLIMMERS BETWEEN THE TWO POLES OF THE WORLD THE GALAXY THAT MAKETH WISE MEN DOUBT THUS CONSTELLATED IN THE DEPTHS OF MARS THOSE RAYS DESCRIBED THE VENERABLE SIGN THAT QUADRANTS JOINING IN A CIRCLE MAKE
87-121553-0056 HERE DOTH MY MEMORY OVERCOME MY GENIUS FOR ON THAT CROSS AS LEVIN GLEAMED FORTH CHRIST SO THAT I CANNOT FIND ENSAMPLE WORTHY BUT HE WHO TAKES HIS CROSS AND FOLLOWS CHRIST AGAIN WILL PARDON ME WHAT I OMIT SEEING IN THAT AURORA LIGHTEN CHRIST
87-121553-0057 SO FROM THE LIGHTS THAT THERE TO ME APPEARED UPGATHERED THROUGH THE CROSS A MELODY WHICH RAPT ME NOT DISTINGUISHING THE HYMN WELL WAS I WARE IT WAS OF LOFTY LAUD BECAUSE THERE CAME TO ME ARISE AND CONQUER AS UNTO HIM WHO HEARS AND COMPREHENDS NOT
87-121553-0058 SO MUCH ENAMOURED I BECAME THEREWITH THAT UNTIL THEN THERE WAS NOT ANYTHING THAT E'ER HAD FETTERED ME WITH SUCH SWEET BONDS PERHAPS MY WORD APPEARS SOMEWHAT TOO BOLD POSTPONING THE DELIGHT OF THOSE FAIR EYES INTO WHICH GAZING MY DESIRE HAS REST
87-121553-0059 BUT WHO BETHINKS HIM THAT THE LIVING SEALS OF EVERY BEAUTY GROW IN POWER ASCENDING AND THAT I THERE HAD NOT TURNED ROUND TO THOSE CAN ME EXCUSE IF I MYSELF ACCUSE TO EXCUSE MYSELF AND SEE THAT I SPEAK TRULY FOR HERE THE HOLY JOY IS NOT DISCLOSED
87-121553-0060 A WILL BENIGN IN WHICH REVEALS ITSELF EVER THE LOVE THAT RIGHTEOUSLY INSPIRES AS IN THE INIQUITOUS CUPIDITY SILENCE IMPOSED UPON THAT DULCET LYRE AND QUIETED THE CONSECRATED CHORDS
87-121553-0061 THAT HEAVEN'S RIGHT HAND DOTH TIGHTEN AND RELAX HOW UNTO JUST ENTREATIES SHALL BE DEAF THOSE SUBSTANCES WHICH TO GIVE ME DESIRE OF PRAYING THEM WITH ONE ACCORD GREW SILENT TIS WELL THAT WITHOUT END HE SHOULD LAMENT
87-121553-0062 WHO FOR THE LOVE OF THING THAT DOTH NOT LAST ETERNALLY DESPOILS HIM OF THAT LOVE AS THROUGH THE PURE AND TRANQUIL EVENING AIR THERE SHOOTS FROM TIME TO TIME A SUDDEN FIRE MOVING THE EYES THAT STEADFAST WERE BEFORE
87-121553-0063 AND SEEMS TO BE A STAR THAT CHANGETH PLACE EXCEPT THAT IN THE PART WHERE IT IS KINDLED NOTHING IS MISSED AND THIS ENDURETH LITTLE SO FROM THE HORN THAT TO THE RIGHT EXTENDS UNTO THAT CROSS'S FOOT THERE RAN A STAR OUT OF THE CONSTELLATION SHINING THERE
87-121553-0064 SO THAT FIRE SEEMED IT BEHIND ALABASTER THUS PITEOUS DID ANCHISES SHADE REACH FORWARD IF ANY FAITH OUR GREATEST MUSE DESERVE WHEN IN ELYSIUM HE HIS SON PERCEIVED
87-121553-0065 THEN PLEASANT TO THE HEARING AND THE SIGHT THE SPIRIT JOINED TO ITS BEGINNING THINGS I UNDERSTOOD NOT SO PROFOUND IT SPAKE NOR DID IT HIDE ITSELF FROM ME BY CHOICE BUT BY NECESSITY FOR ITS CONCEPTION ABOVE THE MARK OF MORTALS SET ITSELF
87-121553-0066 AND WHEN THE BOW OF BURNING SYMPATHY WAS SO FAR SLACKENED THAT ITS SPEECH DESCENDED TOWARDS THE MARK OF OUR INTELLIGENCE THE FIRST THING THAT WAS UNDERSTOOD BY ME WAS BENEDIGHT BE THOU O TRINE AND ONE
87-121553-0067 WHO HAST UNTO MY SEED SO COURTEOUS BEEN AND IT CONTINUED HUNGER LONG AND GRATEFUL DRAWN FROM THE READING OF THE MIGHTY VOLUME WHEREIN IS NEVER CHANGED THE WHITE NOR DARK THOU HAST APPEASED MY SON WITHIN THIS LIGHT IN WHICH I SPEAK TO THEE
87-121553-0068 BY GRACE OF HER WHO TO THIS LOFTY FLIGHT WITH PLUMAGE CLOTHED THEE THOU THINKEST THAT TO ME THY THOUGHT DOTH PASS FROM HIM WHO IS THE FIRST AS FROM THE UNIT IF THAT BE KNOWN RAY OUT THE FIVE AND SIX AND THEREFORE
87-121553-0069 WHO I AM THOU ASKEST NOT AND WHY I SEEM MORE JOYOUS UNTO THEE THAN ANY OTHER OF THIS GLADSOME CROWD THOU THINK'ST THE TRUTH BECAUSE THE SMALL AND GREAT OF THIS EXISTENCE LOOK INTO THE MIRROR WHEREIN BEFORE THOU THINK'ST THY THOUGHT THOU SHOWEST
87-121553-0070 BUT THAT THE SACRED LOVE IN WHICH I WATCH WITH SIGHT PERPETUAL AND WHICH MAKES ME THIRST WITH SWEET DESIRE MAY BETTER BE FULFILLED NOW LET THY VOICE SECURE AND FRANK AND GLAD PROCLAIM THE WISHES THE DESIRE PROCLAIM TO WHICH MY ANSWER IS DECREED ALREADY
87-121553-0071 OF THE SAME WEIGHT FOR EACH OF YOU BECAME FOR IN THE SUN WHICH LIGHTED YOU AND BURNED WITH HEAT AND RADIANCE THEY SO EQUAL ARE THAT ALL SIMILITUDES ARE INSUFFICIENT BUT AMONG MORTALS WILL AND ARGUMENT FOR REASON THAT TO YOU IS MANIFEST
87-121553-0072 DIVERSELY FEATHERED IN THEIR PINIONS ARE WHENCE I WHO MORTAL AM FEEL IN MYSELF THIS INEQUALITY SO GIVE NOT THANKS SAVE IN MY HEART FOR THIS PATERNAL WELCOME TRULY DO I ENTREAT THEE LIVING TOPAZ SET IN THIS PRECIOUS JEWEL AS A GEM
87-121553-0073 THAT THOU WILT SATISFY ME WITH THY NAME O LEAF OF MINE IN WHOM I PLEASURE TOOK E'EN WHILE AWAITING I WAS THINE OWN ROOT SUCH A BEGINNING HE IN ANSWER MADE ME THEN SAID TO ME THAT ONE FROM WHOM IS NAMED THY RACE
87-121553-0074 AND WHO A HUNDRED YEARS AND MORE HAS CIRCLED ROUND THE MOUNT ON THE FIRST CORNICE A SON OF MINE AND THY GREAT GRANDSIRE WAS WELL IT BEHOVES THEE THAT THE LONG FATIGUE THOU SHOULDST FOR HIM MAKE SHORTER WITH THY WORKS FLORENCE WITHIN THE ANCIENT BOUNDARY
87-121553-0075 FROM WHICH SHE TAKETH STILL HER TIERCE AND NONES ABODE IN QUIET TEMPERATE AND CHASTE NO GOLDEN CHAIN SHE HAD NOR CORONAL NOR LADIES SHOD WITH SANDAL SHOON NOR GIRDLE THAT CAUGHT THE EYE MORE THAN THE PERSON DID
87-121553-0076 NOT YET THE DAUGHTER AT HER BIRTH STRUCK FEAR INTO THE FATHER FOR THE TIME AND DOWER DID NOT O'ERRUN THIS SIDE OR THAT THE MEASURE NO HOUSES HAD SHE VOID OF FAMILIES NOT YET HAD THITHER COME SARDANAPALUS TO SHOW WHAT IN A CHAMBER CAN BE DONE
87-121553-0077 WHICH SURPASSED SHALL IN ITS DOWNFALL BE AS IN ITS RISE
87-121553-0078 AND FROM THE MIRROR HIS DAME DEPART WITHOUT A PAINTED FACE AND HIM OF NERLI SAW AND HIM OF VECCHIO CONTENTED WITH THEIR SIMPLE SUITS OF BUFF AND WITH THE SPINDLE AND THE FLAX THEIR DAMES O FORTUNATE WOMEN
87-121553-0079 ANOTHER DRAWING TRESSES FROM HER DISTAFF TOLD O'ER AMONG HER FAMILY THE TALES OF TROJANS AND OF FESOLE AND ROME AS GREAT A MARVEL THEN WOULD HAVE BEEN HELD A LAPO SALTERELLO
87-121553-0080 AS CINCINNATUS OR CORNELIA NOW TO SUCH A QUIET SUCH A BEAUTIFUL LIFE OF THE CITIZEN TO SUCH A SAFE COMMUNITY AND TO SO SWEET AN INN DID MARY GIVE ME WITH LOUD CRIES INVOKED AND IN YOUR ANCIENT BAPTISTERY AT ONCE CHRISTIAN AND CACCIAGUIDA I BECAME
87-121553-0081 MORONTO WAS MY BROTHER AND ELISEO FROM VAL DI PADO CAME TO ME MY WIFE AND FROM THAT PLACE THY SURNAME WAS DERIVED I FOLLOWED AFTERWARD THE EMPEROR CONRAD AND HE BEGIRT ME OF HIS CHIVALRY SO MUCH I PLEASED HIM WITH MY NOBLE DEEDS
87-121553-0082 I FOLLOWED IN HIS TRAIN AGAINST THAT LAW'S INIQUITY WHOSE PEOPLE DOTH USURP YOUR JUST POSSESSION THROUGH YOUR PASTOR'S FAULT THERE BY THAT EXECRABLE RACE WAS I RELEASED FROM BONDS OF THE FALLACIOUS WORLD
87-121553-0083 O THOU OUR POOR NOBILITY OF BLOOD IF THOU DOST MAKE THE PEOPLE GLORY IN THEE DOWN HERE WHERE OUR AFFECTION LANGUISHES A MARVELLOUS THING IT NE'ER WILL BE TO ME FOR THERE WHERE APPETITE IS NOT PERVERTED
87-121553-0084 I SAY IN HEAVEN OF THEE I MADE A BOAST TRULY THOU ART A CLOAK THAT QUICKLY SHORTENS SO THAT UNLESS WE PIECE THEE DAY BY DAY TIME GOETH ROUND ABOUT THEE WITH HIS SHEARS WITH YOU WHICH ROME WAS FIRST TO TOLERATE
87-121553-0085 WHEREIN HER FAMILY LESS PERSEVERES YET ONCE AGAIN MY WORDS BEGINNING MADE WHENCE BEATRICE WHO STOOD SOMEWHAT APART SMILING APPEARED LIKE UNTO HER WHO COUGHED
87-121553-0086 AND I BEGAN YOU ARE MY ANCESTOR YOU GIVE TO ME ALL HARDIHOOD TO SPEAK YOU LIFT ME SO THAT I AM MORE THAN I SO MANY RIVULETS WITH GLADNESS FILL MY MIND THAT OF ITSELF IT MAKES A JOY BECAUSE IT CAN ENDURE THIS AND NOT BURST
87-121553-0087 THEN TELL ME MY BELOVED ROOT ANCESTRAL WHO WERE YOUR ANCESTORS AND WHAT THE YEARS THAT IN YOUR BOYHOOD CHRONICLED THEMSELVES TELL ME ABOUT THE SHEEPFOLD OF SAINT JOHN HOW LARGE IT WAS AND WHO THE PEOPLE WERE WITHIN IT WORTHY OF THE HIGHEST SEATS
87-121553-0088 AS AT THE BLOWING OF THE WINDS A COAL QUICKENS TO FLAME SO I BEHELD THAT LIGHT BECOME RESPLENDENT AT MY BLANDISHMENTS AND AS UNTO MINE EYES IT GREW MORE FAIR WITH VOICE MORE SWEET AND TENDER BUT NOT IN THIS MODERN DIALECT IT SAID TO ME
87-121553-0089 FROM UTTERING OF THE AVE TILL THE BIRTH IN WHICH MY MOTHER WHO IS NOW A SAINT OF ME WAS LIGHTENED WHO HAD BEEN HER BURDEN
87-121553-0090 FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY TIMES AND THIRTY MORE TO REINFLAME ITSELF BENEATH HIS PAW MY ANCESTORS AND I OUR BIRTHPLACE HAD WHERE FIRST IS FOUND THE LAST WARD OF THE CITY BY HIM WHO RUNNETH IN YOUR ANNUAL GAME SUFFICE IT OF MY ELDERS TO HEAR THIS
87-121553-0091 BUT WHO THEY WERE AND WHENCE THEY THITHER CAME SILENCE IS MORE CONSIDERATE THAN SPEECH ALL THOSE WHO AT THAT TIME WERE THERE BETWEEN MARS AND THE BAPTIST FIT FOR BEARING ARMS WERE A FIFTH PART OF THOSE WHO NOW ARE LIVING BUT THE COMMUNITY THAT NOW IS MIXED
87-121553-0092 AND HIM OF SIGNA WHO HAS SHARP EYES FOR TRICKERY ALREADY HAD NOT THE FOLK WHICH MOST OF ALL THE WORLD DEGENERATES BEEN A STEP DAME UNTO CAESAR
87-121553-0093 SOME WHO TURN FLORENTINES AND TRADE AND DISCOUNT WOULD HAVE GONE BACK AGAIN TO SIMIFONTE THERE WHERE THEIR GRANDSIRES WENT ABOUT AS BEGGARS AT MONTEMURLO STILL WOULD BE THE COUNTS THE CERCHI IN THE PARISH OF ACONE PERHAPS IN VALDIGRIEVE
87-121553-0094 THE BUONDELMONTI EVER THE INTERMINGLING OF THE PEOPLE HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF MALADY IN CITIES AS IN THE BODY FOOD IT SURFEITS ON AND A BLIND BULL MORE HEADLONG PLUNGES DOWN THAN A BLIND LAMB AND VERY OFTEN CUTS BETTER AND MORE A SINGLE SWORD THAN FIVE
87-121553-0095 IF LUNI THOU REGARD AND URBISAGLIA HOW THEY HAVE PASSED AWAY AND HOW ARE PASSING CHIUSI AND SINIGAGLIA AFTER THEM TO HEAR HOW RACES WASTE THEMSELVES AWAY WILL SEEM TO THEE NO NOVEL THING NOR HARD
87-121553-0096 SEEING THAT EVEN CITIES HAVE AN END ALL THINGS OF YOURS HAVE THEIR MORTALITY EVEN AS YOURSELVES BUT IT IS HIDDEN IN SOME THAT A LONG WHILE ENDURE AND LIVES ARE SHORT AND AS THE TURNING OF THE LUNAR HEAVEN COVERS AND BARES THE SHORES WITHOUT A PAUSE
87-121553-0097 IN THE LIKE MANNER FORTUNE DOES WITH FLORENCE THEREFORE SHOULD NOT APPEAR A MARVELLOUS THING WHAT I SHALL SAY OF THE GREAT FLORENTINES OF WHOM THE FAME IS HIDDEN IN THE PAST I SAW THE UGHI

87-121553-0102 SO LIKEWISE DID THE ANCESTORS OF THOSE WHO EVERMORE WHEN VACANT IS YOUR CHURCH FATTEN BY STAYING IN CONSISTORY THE INSOLENT RACE THAT LIKE A DRAGON FOLLOWS WHOEVER FLEES AND UNTO HIM THAT SHOWS HIS TEETH OR PURSE IS GENTLE AS A LAMB
87-121553-0103 ALREADY RISING WAS BUT FROM LOW PEOPLE SO THAT IT PLEASED NOT UBERTIN DONATO THAT HIS WIFE'S FATHER SHOULD MAKE HIM THEIR KIN ALREADY HAD CAPONSACCO TO THE MARKET FROM FESOLE DESCENDED AND ALREADY GIUDA AND INFANGATO WERE GOOD BURGHERS

87-121553-0106 MANY WOULD BE REJOICING WHO ARE SAD IF GOD HAD THEE SURRENDERED TO THE EMA THE FIRST TIME THAT THOU CAMEST TO THE CITY BUT IT BEHOVED THE MUTILATED STONE WHICH GUARDS THE BRIDGE THAT FLORENCE SHOULD PROVIDE A VICTIM IN HER LATEST HOUR OF PEACE
87-121553-0107 WITH ALL THESE FAMILIES AND OTHERS WITH THEM FLORENCE BEHELD I IN SO GREAT REPOSE THAT NO OCCASION HAD SHE WHENCE TO WEEP
8747-293952-0000 THINGS WENT VERY SMOOTHLY AT GORE HALL AFTER DURHAM HAD ESTABLISHED LUCY AS ITS MISTRESS DURING THE ABSENCE OF BERNARD THE GIRL HERSELF FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT HER COUSIN WAS DEAD AND ASSUMED DEEP MOURNING
8747-293952-0001 AND FELT HIS LOSS DEEPLY IT WAS HER OUTSPOKEN AFFECTION THAT PROVOKED A QUARREL BETWEEN HER AND JULIUS AND WHICH LED TO THE BREAKING OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT LUCY HAD A HIGH TEMPER WHICH HAD BEEN KEPT IN SUBJECTION DURING THE LIFE OF SIR SIMON
8747-293952-0002 BUT NOW THAT SHE TASTED THE SWEETS OF POWER SHE WAS NOT DISPOSED TO ALLOW JULIUS TO TREAT HER AS HE CHOSE MISSUS GILROY CAME BACK FROM HER VISIT TO THE LAWYER
8747-293952-0003 SHE SAW THAT SHE HAD GONE TOO FAR AND HAD GIVEN DURHAM AN INKLING AS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF MICHAEL HAVING MASQUERADED AS BERNARD
8747-293952-0004 KNOWING THAT SHE HAD MARRIED WALTER GORE AND ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A FLAW IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES UPON WHICH SHE BUILT HER CLAIM YET SHE TRUSTED TO HER OWN CLEVERNESS TO CONCEAL THIS FROM THE TOO CLEVER LAWYER BUT APART FROM THIS
8747-293952-0005 THE FACT THAT HE SUSPECTED SOMEONE OF PASSING HIMSELF OFF AS BERNARD STARTLED HER AND OPENED AN ABYSS AT HER FEET ON LEAVING THE OFFICE SHE JUDGED IT BEST TO LOWER HER CREST FOR THE MOMENT AND TO WAIT PATIENTLY TO SEE WHAT WOULD TRANSPIRE
8747-293952-0006 MISSUS GILROY WAS A WELL EDUCATED WOMAN AND VERY ASTUTE THEREFORE SHE HOPED TO GAIN HER ENDS BY CRAFT IF NOT BY FORCE SO FAR SHE HAD FAILED BUT SHE DID NOT INTEND TO ABANDON HER CLAIM
8747-293952-0007 FOR ONE FAILURE AS IT WAS SHE CAME BACK TO THE HALL AND BEHAVED HERSELF MUCH BETTER THAN SHE HAD EVER DONE BEFORE SHE WAS RESPECTFUL TO LUCY AND DID NOT DISPLAY HER IMPATIENCE OF COMMANDS THAT
8747-293952-0008 SHE HAD HITHERTO DONE NO ONE COULD HAVE BEEN MEEKER AND ALTHOUGH MISS RANDOLPH DID NOT LIKE OR TRUST THE WOMAN SHE HAD NO FAULT TO FIND WITH HER IN ANY WAY LUCY SUFFERED SEVERELY FROM THE SHOCK OF SIR SIMON'S TRAGIC DEATH
8747-293952-0009 AND FROM THE SUPPOSED DEATH OF SIR BERNARD IN FACT THE MATTER SO PREYED ON HER NERVES THAT SHE BECAME PROSTRATE AND DOCTOR PAYNE HAD TO BE CALLED IN HE WAS A HANDSOME AND POPULAR YOUNG DOCTOR WHO HAD PRACTICED IN HURSETON
8747-293952-0010 HE WAS NATURALLY VERY PLEASED AND WAS VERY ATTENTIVE A COMPLETE REST IS WHAT YOU NEED HE SAID TO MISS RANDOLPH
8747-293952-0011 AND I WILL GIVE YOU A TONIC NATURALLY YOU SUFFER FROM THE TERRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES OF SIR SIMON'S DEATH HE THOUGHT A MOMENT
8747-293952-0012 A CHEERFUL COMPANION WOULD DO YOU GOOD SHALL I ASK MISS MALLESON TO COME OVER IS SHE CHEERFUL ASKED LUCY LANGUIDLY I FEAR NOT DOCTOR SHE WAS ENGAGED TO MY COUSIN AND HIS DEATH HAS MADE HER SAD
8747-293952-0013 PROBABLY BUT SHE BEARS UP WONDERFULLY BUT THAT SHE IS IN MOURNING ONE WOULD HARDLY GUESS SHE HAD SUSTAINED SUCH A LOSS WAS SHE VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MISTER GORE YES
8747-293952-0014 I NEVER SAW A MORE ATTACHED COUPLE DID YOU EVER MEET HIM ONCE AT MISS PLANTAGENET'S YOU KNOW I AM GREAT FRIENDS WITH THE OLD LADY I OFTEN VISIT HER NOT PROFESSIONALLY FOR SHE IS AS HEALTHY AS A TROUT IN A POND
8747-293952-0015 IS ALICE MISS MALLESON ALSO WELL IN VERY GOOD HEALTH AND APPEARS RESIGNED TO HER LOSS I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE FELT IT MORE SAID LUCY PERPLEXED
8747-293952-0016 ALICE HAS SUCH A TENDER HEART DOCTOR PAYNE WAS DOUBTFUL SO FAR AS HE SAW MISS MALLESON WAS REMARKABLY CHEERFUL UNDER HER SORROW SHE IS PHILOSOPHIC MISS RANDOLPH
8747-293952-0017 I THINK HOWEVER IF YOU WOULD HAVE HER OVER TO SEE YOU IT WOULD DO BOTH HER AND YOURSELF GOOD I SHALL WRITE A NOTE TO HER TO DAY SAID LUCY I AM VERY FOND OF HER AND WE GET ON VERY WELL TOGETHER
8747-293952-0018 POOR ALICE I WISH BERNARD HAD LIVED
8747-293952-0019 RISING TO TAKE HIS LEAVE IF HE WAS GUILTY AH SAID LUCY RAISING HERSELF WITH ANIMATION FROM THE SOFA UPON WHICH SHE WAS LYING IF HE WAS GUILTY
8747-293952-0020 I DO NOT BELIEVE HE WAS
8747-293952-0021 BUT HE COULD NOT ALWAYS CONTROL IT AND WAS A KIND HEARTED BOY HE IS INNOCENT I AM SURE HOW ARE YOU SURE MY DEAR LUCY ASKED A THIRD VOICE AND SHE LOOKED UP TO SEE JULIUS STANDING IN THE DOORWAY
8747-293952-0022 HE CAME FORWARD FORGIVE ME IF I HEARD A FEW WORDS OF YOUR CONVERSATION BUT I HAVE JUST COME IN DOCTOR PAYNE I HOPE I SEE YOU WELL QUITE WELL SAID THE DOCTOR WHO DID NOT LIKE BERYL THINKING HIM
8747-293952-0023 IN SCHOOLBOY PHRASE A SNEAK I AM JUST GOING MISTER BERYL ARE YOU ILL LUCY ASKED BERYL WITH AFFECTION I HAVE AN ATTACK OF NERVES SHE REPLIED PETTISHLY
8747-293952-0024 POOR BERNARD'S DEATH HAS SHAKEN ME IT IS JUST AS WELL HE DID DIE THOUGH I HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT SAID PAYNE BUT I MUST TAKE MY LEAVE I WILL COME AND SEE YOU AGAIN MISS RANDOLPH AND REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU
8747-293952-0025 REST AND CHEERFUL COMPANY MISS MALLESON'S FOR CHOICE HE DEPARTED SMILING AND THEY HEARD HIM GALLOP OFF WHEN THE SOUND OF THE HORSE'S HOOFS DIED AWAY
8747-293952-0026 WHY DO YOU THINK BERNARD IS INNOCENT HE ASKED BECAUSE IF HE IS GUILTY HIS ACTION GIVES THE LIE TO HIS WHOLE LIFE JULIUS SHE REPLIED RAISING HERSELF ON HER ELBOW I CAN'T BELIEVE HE KILLED MY UNCLE
8747-293952-0027 SIR SIMON IS NOT YOUR UNCLE SAID BERYL JEALOUSLY YOU ARE ONLY A DISTANT RELATIVE PERHAPS MY MARRIAGE WITH YOU MAY MAKE ME A NEARER ONE
8747-293952-0028 IF WE EVER DO MARRY SAID JULIUS GLOOMILY SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED I SHOULD LIKE TO BREAK THE ENGAGEMENT JULIUS WE WERE NEVER SUITED TO ONE ANOTHER BERYL'S VANITY WAS HURT
8747-293952-0029 WHY DID YOU ACCEPT ME THEN WHAT ELSE COULD I DO IT WAS SIR SIMON'S WISH THAT WE SHOULD MARRY AND OWING TO MY CIRCUMSTANCES I HAD NO CHOICE IN THE MATTER DURING HIS LIFE I WAS MERELY A PUPPET
8747-293952-0030 ALTHOUGH YOU SWORE FOR AN HOUR
8747-293952-0031 YOU TOLD SIR SIMON ABOUT BERNARD BEING IN LOVE WITH ALICE THAT THE POOR BOY MIGHT BE DISINHERITED BERYL DID NOT DENY THE CHARGE I BELIEVE YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH BERNARD YOURSELF HE SAID
8747-293952-0032 NO BERNARD AND I ARE LIKE BROTHER AND SISTER BUT HE IS DEAD
8747-293952-0033 LUCY SAT UP ON THE SOFA AND PUSHED THE LOOSE HAIR BACK FROM HER FOREHEAD WHY DO YOU SAY THAT SHE ASKED SHARPLY JULIUS STARED AT THE FIRE I CAN'T UNDERSTAND DURHAM'S ATTITUDE HE SAID EVASIVELY
8747-293952-0034 HE MUST KNOW THAT BERNARD IS DEAD SEEING THAT THE COAT AND HAT WERE FOUND ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER NO MAN COULD HAVE LIVED IN THE COLD AND THE FOG YET IF DURHAM WAS SURE HE WOULD NOT HOLD THE ESTATE AGAINST BERNARD'S COMING
8747-293952-0035 MISTER DURHAM REQUIRES PROOF OF THE DEATH REJOINED LUCY SHARPLY AND UNTIL THEN HE IS BOUND TO ADMINISTER THE ESTATE ACCORDING TO THE WILL AS BERNARD'S BODY HAS NOT BEEN FOUND
8747-293952-0036 THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE THAT HE MAY HAVE ESCAPED I SINCERELY TRUST NOT AH YOU ALWAYS HATED BERNARD ON THE CONTRARY I SPEAK FOR HIS GOOD
8747-293952-0037 WHAT'S THE USE OF HIS COMING TO LIFE WHEN HE MUST SUFFER FOR HIS CRIME
8747-293952-0038 YOU HAVE NO GROUNDS FOR SAYING THAT SAID JULIUS PALE WITH RAGE I DON'T NEED GROUNDS RETORTED THE GENUINE WOMAN BERNARD ALWAYS WAS AS KIND HEARTED AS YOU WERE AND ARE THE REVERSE
8747-293952-0039 I AM NOT HARD HEARTED SNAPPED BERYL I ALWAYS DO GOOD
8747-293952-0040 NOT ALWAYS FOR INSTANCE I AM DOWN HERE TO GET A SMALL BOY A POST WITH MISS PLANTAGENET AS A PAGE THAT IS VERY GOOD OF YOU SAID LUCY SCORNFULLY AH YOU SEE I CAN DO A KIND ACTION
8747-293952-0041 THIS BOY IS A GRANDSON OF LORD CONNISTON'S HOUSEKEEPER MISSUS MOON AT COVE CASTLE SAID LUCY WITH SOME COLOR IN HER FACE I KNOW DO YOU KNOW LORD CONNISTON ASKED JULIUS SUSPICIOUSLY I HAVE MET HIM ONCE
8747-293952-0042 HE SEEMS TO BE A MOST DELIGHTFUL FELLOW WHAT A DELIGHTFUL SPEECH FOR A LADY SAID BERYL CONNISTON IS A SCAMP I HEARD HE ENLISTED IN THE LANCERS IT SHOWS HOW BRAVE HE IS EVERY MAN WORTH CALLING A MAN
8747-293952-0043 SHOULD GO TO THE FRONT PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO GO SNEERED JULIUS YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE THE PLUCK SAID LUCY QUICKLY ALL YOUR ENDS IN LIFE ARE GAINED BY CUNNING
8747-293952-0044 LUCY IF YOU TALK TO ME LIKE THAT BEGAN BERYL AND THEN RESTRAINED HIMSELF WITH AN EFFORT IT IS NO USE OUR QUARRELLING LET ME SHOW YOU THAT I AM NOT SO CARELESS OF OTHERS OR SO HARD HEARTED AS I SEEM TO BE
8747-293952-0045 MISS PLANTAGENET WANTS A PAGE I FOUND THIS LAD IN LONDON SELLING MATCHES HE WAS A MESSENGER BOY AT A TOBACCONIST CALLED TABERLEY AND LORD CONNISTON GOT HIM TURNED OUT OF THE SITUATION
8747-293952-0046 THE BOY TOLD ME HIMSELF HE WILL TELL YOU IF YOU LIKE TO SEE HIM I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM LORD CONNISTON IS TOO KIND A MAN TO BEHAVE IN THAT WAY HE WAS FOND OF BERNARD
8747-293952-0047 AND THAT MAKES HIM PERFECT IN YOUR EYES SAID BERYL LOOKING SAVAGE SEE HERE LUCY CONNISTON HAS LEFT THE ARMY SO YOU SEE HE IS NOT SO BRAVE AS YOU THINK
8747-293952-0048 HE LEFT SO AS TO SEEK AFTER BERNARD SAID LUCY QUICKLY MISTER DURHAM TOLD ME SO
8747-293952-0049 AND I BELIEVE BERNARD MAY BE ALIVE AFTER ALL IN WHICH CASE YOU WOULD GIVE HIM UP TO THE POLICE NO SAID JULIUS WITH AN EMOTION WHICH DID HIM CREDIT I SHOULD NEVER BETRAY HIM
8747-293952-0050 LUCY IF YOU CAN FIND OUT FROM LORD CONNISTON OR DURHAM THAT BERNARD IS ALIVE LET ME KNOW AND I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO TO HELP HIM HOW CAN YOU HELP HIM WHEN YOU BELIEVE HIM GUILTY I MIGHT HELP HIM TO ESCAPE
8747-293952-0051 I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM HANGED HE WON'T BE HANGED IF LORD CONNISTON AND MISTER DURHAM CAN SAVE HIM AH JULIUS STARTED TO HIS FEET THEN HE IS ALIVE
8747-293952-0052 I CAN'T SAY I HAVE NO REASON TO THINK HE IS BUT I AM HOPING AGAINST HOPE SAID LUCY RISING I MERELY STATE WHAT WAS SAID MISTER DURHAM AND LORD CONNISTON BOTH TOLD ALICE THAT BERNARD WAS INNOCENT
8747-293952-0053 THEY WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO PROVE THAT SNEERED BERYL WITH A WHITE FACE I BELIEVE THE FELLOW IS ALIVE AFTER ALL
8747-293952-0054 AND THEN ASKED LUCY STARTING UP AND FACING BERYL
8747-293952-0055 AH YOU WOULD MAKE HIM PAY MONEY TO SAVE HIMSELF I HAVE A RIGHT TO A PORTION OF THE ESTATE YOU HAVE NOT SAID MISS RANDOLPH CLENCHING HER FISTS AND ALL HER LANGUOR GONE BERNARD IS THE OWNER OF GORE HALL
8747-293952-0056 AND OF ALL THE PROPERTY AND OF THE TITLE ALSO
8747-293952-0057 HIS NAME WILL BE CLEARED AND THEN YOU WILL THROW ME OVER AND TRY TO BECOME LADY GORE I THROW YOU OVER NOW SAID LUCY LOSING HER TEMPER AND COLORING HOTLY HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO ME LIKE THIS JULIUS
8747-293952-0058 I WILL NO LONGER BE BOUND TO YOU I NEVER LOVED YOU BUT I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO SEE THE BEST SIDE OF YOU BUT YOU HAVE NO GOOD SIDE YOU ARE A MEAN COWARDLY SERPENT AND IF BERNARD IS ALIVE I SHALL DO MY BEST TO DEFEND HIM
8747-293952-0059 FROM YOUR SNARES BUT LUCY DON'T SPEAK TO ME
8747-293952-0060 I GIVE YOU BACK YOUR RING HERE IT IS SHE WRENCHED IT FROM HER FINGER NOW LEAVE THE HOUSE MISTER BERYL I AM MISTRESS HERE JULIUS LOOKED AT THE RING WHICH SHE HAD THROWN AT HIS FEET AND LAUGHED
8747-293952-0061 YOU TAKE A HIGH TONE HE SAID SNEERINGLY BUT REMEMBER THAT IF BERNARD IS DEAD THE MONEY GOES TO CHARITIES SO MUCH THE BETTER YOU DO NOT GET IT NOR YOU EITHER
8747-293952-0062 YOU WILL HAVE TO TURN OUT OF THIS LUXURIOUS HOME AND LIVE ON THE PITTANCE SIR SIMON LEFT YOU WOULD I BE BETTER OFF IF I MARRIED YOU I THINK YOU WOULD I HAVE NOT MUCH MONEY NOW BUT I WILL HAVE SOME
8747-293952-0063 A GREAT DEAL SOME DAY BY BLACKMAILING BERNARD SAID LUCY INDIGNANTLY JULIUS PICKED UP THE RING AND SLIPPED IT INTO HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET CALMLY WE DON'T KNOW THAT BERNARD IS ALIVE
8747-293952-0064 BUT THE FACT OF CONNISTON LEAVING THE ARMY AND FROM DURHAM'S ATTITUDE I SHREWDLY SUSPECT HE IS AND IN HIDING
8747-293952-0065 AND THEN IT DEPENDS UPON HIM WHETHER HE IS HANGED OR PREFERS TO LIVE ABROAD ON A PORTION OF HIS MONEY THE LESSER PORTION I KNOW THE PRICE OF YOUR SILENCE SAID LUCY VEHEMENTLY YOU WILL WANT THE HALL AND A LARGE INCOME
8747-293952-0066 ALL I CAN GET REJOINED BERYL QUIETLY AND YOU HAVE REFUSED TO SHARE MY FORTUNE WITH ME YES I WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU AND REMEMBER THAT IF I CATCH YOU PLOTTING I WILL TELL MISTER DURHAM
8747-293952-0067 YOU CAN TELL HIM THE WHOLE OF THIS CONVERSATION SNARLED BERYL I AM NOT AFRAID OF DURHAM IF BERNARD IS ALIVE HE'LL HAVE TO PAY UP OR BE HANGED HE IS INNOCENT
8747-293952-0068 JULIUS SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND WALKED TO THE DOOR THERE HE PAUSED TO UTTER A FINAL INSULTING SPEECH I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU INTEND TO MARRY BERNARD OR LORD CONNISTON HE SAID BUT I WISH
8747-293952-0069 WHICH EVER IT IS JOY OF A SPITFIRE AND AN HONEST WOMAN SAID MISS RANDOLPH WRATHFULLY FOR THE REFERENCE TO CONNISTON TOUCHED HER NEARLY
8747-293952-0070 BUT YOU GO TOO FAST YOU CAN'T YET PROVE THAT BERNARD LIVES I GO TO DO SO SNEERED JULIUS AND BOWED HIMSELF IRONICALLY OUT OF THE ROOM LEAVING LUCY FURIOUS BOTH WITH HIM AND WITH HERSELF
8747-293952-0071 SHE WAS ANGRY WITH HERSELF BECAUSE SHE FELT THAT IN SPEAKING OF CONNISTON SHE HAD COLORED AND AS A MATTER OF FACT SHE GREATLY ADMIRED THE YOUNG LORD EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD ONLY MET ONCE
8747-293952-0072 FOR CONNISTON WAS ONE OF THOSE IRRESISTIBLE MEN WHO APPEAL TO WOMEN LUCY THOUGHT BUT IT MATTERS LITTLE WHAT SHE THOUGHT ALL SHE KNEW WAS THAT HER ENGAGEMENT TO JULIUS WHICH HAD ALWAYS WEIGHED ON HER CONSCIENCE WAS AT AN END
8747-293952-0073 I AM FREE NOW FREE SHE SAID STRETCHING HER HANDS OH WHAT AN ESCAPE I HAVE HAD FROM THAT WICKED MAN HE HAS SHOWN HIS HAND TOO PLAINLY I WILL PUT MISTER DURHAM ON HIS GUARD AND
8747-293952-0074 HERE SHE BLUSHED AND LORD CONNISTON JULIUS WALKING TOWARDS THE BOWER WAS ALSO ANGRY WITH HIMSELF AS LUCY THOUGHT HE HAD SHOWN HIS HAND TOO CLEARLY
8747-293952-0075 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER HE CONSIDERED TO HAVE HELD MY TONGUE I SHOULD HAVE DONE SO HAD SHE NOT GOADED ME INTO SPEECH SHE WILL TELL DURHAM AND THAT INTERFERING CONNISTON AND PUT THEM ON THEIR GUARD WELL
8747-293952-0076 HE LAUGHED AND LOOKED AT THE SMALL BOY TROTTING BESIDE HIM I AM EQUAL TO BOTH THE BOY WAS A HANDSOME INNOCENT LOOKING LITTLE FELLOW RATHER UNDERSIZED
8747-293952-0077 WITH HIS CLEAR SKIN HIS FAIR HAIR AND WIDE BLUE EYES HE LOOKED LIKE THE CONVENTIONAL PICTURE OF A CHERUB
8747-293952-0078 BUT HIS MIND HAD NOT YET HAD TIME TO WORK ON HIS FACE AND THE MASK OF HIS CHILDHOOD FOR HE WAS ONLY THIRTEEN CONCEALED HIS EVIL NATURE SUCCESSFULLY IN A FEW YEARS WHEN HIS PASSIONS WORKED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE MASK HIS FACE
8747-293952-0079 WOULD BE WRINKLED AND SINFUL HIS MIND WOULD HAVE MARKED PLAINLY ITS SIGNET ON THE SMOOTH SURFACE BUT AT PRESENT HE LOOKED CHARMINGLY INNOCENT ALTHOUGH HE ALREADY KNEW MUCH MORE ABOUT LIFE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HIM
8747-293952-0080 JULIUS IN ORDER THAT THE LAD MIGHT MAKE AN IMPRESSION ON MISS PLANTAGENET HAD DRESSED HIM IN A NEW SUIT AND PLEASED WITH HIMSELF FOR MUCH OF THE BOY REMAINED IN THIS PRECOCIOUS CRIMINAL YOUNG JERRY TROTTED ALONG SMILING
8747-293952-0081 JERRY SAID BERYL LOOKING DOWN MIND YOU ARE NICE TO THE OLD LADY JERRY TOSSED HIS FAIR CURLS AND LOOKED ROGUISH OH THAT'S ALL RIGHT MISTER BERYL ALL OLD LADIES TAKE TO ME
8747-293952-0082 THEY THINK I'M A KIND OF HOLY BILL AND I LET THEM THINK SO IT PAYS JERRY YOU ARE A YOUNG SCAMP OF THE WORST THE BOY CHUCKLED AS THOUGH HE HAD RECEIVED A COMPLIMENT I LIKE DOING THINGS HE EXPLAINED FRANKLY IT'S FUN
8747-293952-0083 IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR VICTORIA
8747-293952-0084 YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT SUCH THINGS CORRECTED THE RESPECTABLE MISTER BERYL SEVERELY I KNOW A JOLLY SIGHT MORE THAN YOU THINK SAID THE URCHIN UNDER HIS BREATH AND PRODUCING A CIGARETTE JULIUS TOOK IT FROM HIM
8747-293952-0085 AND DULL SAID JERRY PUTTING HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS LORD WHAT A BORE STOPPING WITH HER WILL BE BUT I CAN NIP OVER AND SEE VICTORIA WHEN I LIKE AND KEEP AN EYE ON LORD CONNISTON AS I TOLD YOU
8747-293952-0086 I'M FLY SAID MASTER MOON AND BEGAN WHISTLING JULIUS LOOKED AT HIM WITH SATISFACTION HE INTENDED THAT THE BOY SHOULD REMAIN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SO AS TO KEEP WATCH ON CONNISTON
8747-293952-0087 ON DURHAM AND ON ALICE MALLESON FOR THIS LAST REASON HE WAS INTRODUCING HIM INTO THE HOUSE IF BERNARD WERE ALIVE AS JULIUS BEGAN TO SUSPECT HE WOULD COME TO ONE OF THESE THREE PEOPLE AND THEN JERRY WOULD AT ONCE BECOME AWARE OF THE FACT
8747-293952-0088 MISS BERENGARIA WAS AS USUAL IN THE GARDEN LOOKING AFTER THE WELL BEING OF SOME WHITE CHRYSANTHEMUMS SHE RAISED HER HEAD WHEN SHE SAW HER VISITORS AND A LOOK OF ANNOYANCE CROSSED HER FACE WHEN SHE SAW MISTER BERYL
8747-293952-0089 AND BUT FOR THE SAKE OF ALICE SHE WOULD HAVE REFUSED TO LET HIM ENTER THE BOWER AS IT WAS AND WITH GREAT DIPLOMACY SO GREAT THAT IT DECEIVED EVEN THE ASTUTE BERYL SHE ASKED HIM TO COME INTO THE HOUSE
8747-293952-0090 LUCKILY ALICE WAS OUT OF THE WAY HAVING GONE TO PAY A VISIT BUT SHE WAS EXPECTED BACK MOMENTARILY AND MISS BERENGARIA WISHED TO GET RID OF JULIUS BEFORE THE GIRL RETURNED SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONCEAL HER REAL FEELINGS BUT
8747-293952-0091 ALICE BEING SO YOUNG AND IMPULSIVE MIGHT SHOW HER DISLIKE TOO PLAINLY AND PUT BERYL ON HIS GUARD WHO IS THIS YOU HAVE HERE ASKED MISS PLANTAGENET PUTTING ON HER SPECTACLES AND SURVEYING JERRY WITH ADMIRATION WHAT A PRETTY LAD
8747-293952-0092 HE IS A LAD I WISH YOU TO HELP SAID BERYL BLANDLY LAST TIME WE MET MISS PLANTAGENET YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU WANTED A PAGE NOT EXACTLY A PAGE SAID THE OLD DAME RUBBING HER NOSE
8747-293952-0093 A SURE SIGN SHE WAS PERPLEXED MERELY A BOY TO SEE AFTER THE FOWLS AND TO WAIT ABOUT THE HOUSE WHEN NECESSARY I LOVE FOWLS SAID JERRY SWEETLY AND LOOKING AS INNOCENT AS A BABE AND DOGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
8747-293952-0094 YOU SEEM A NICE LAD WHO IS HE MISTER BERYL A POOR BOY WHO SOLD MATCHES IN LONDON BUT I DIDN'T ALWAYS PIPED JERRY SHIFTING FROM ONE LEG TO THE OTHER IN FEIGNED EMBARRASSMENT AND PLAYING HIS PART PERFECTLY
8747-293952-0095 I LIVED WITH GRANDMOTHER AT COVE CASTLE THAT'S LORD CONNISTON'S PLACE SAID MISS BERENGARIA MORE PERPLEXED THAN EVER WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE I LIVED WITH GRANDMOTHER MY NAME IS JERRY MOON
8747-293952-0096 HIS LORDSHIP GOT ME A SITUATION AT A TOBACCONIST'S SAID THE CHILD LIKE MOON AND THEN HE GOT ME TURNED OFF WHY THAT IS NOT LIKE LORD CONNISTON
8747-293952-0097 IT IS NOT TO LORD CONNISTON'S CREDIT BUT I MUST KNOW THE REASON SAID THE OLD DAME SHARPLY IF YOU WANT ME TO TAKE THE LAD INTO MY SERVICE JERRY IN ANSWER TO A LOOK OF BERYL'S BEGAN TO WEEP OSTENTATIOUSLY
8747-293952-0098 I SAW HIS LORDSHIP DRESSED AS A SOLDIER HE SNUFFLED AND I TOLD MISTER BERYL HIS LORDSHIP WAS SO ANGRY THAT HE GOT ME TURNED OFF SAYING I WAS UNGRATEFUL
8747-293952-0099 YOU SHOULD ALWAYS HOLD YOUR TONGUE SAID MISS BERENGARIA ANGRILY YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO TELL WHAT LORD CONNISTON WISHED KEPT SECRET IT WAS ONLY A FREAK ON HIS PART HE LEFT THE ARMY AT MY REQUEST
8747-293952-0100 AT YOUR REQUEST SAID JULIUS LOOKING AT HER DIRECTLY FOREARMED AS SHE WAS MISS BERENGARIA WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF BERNARD'S SECRET FLUSHED THROUGH HER WITHERED SKIN
8747-293952-0101 BUT TURNED THE CONVERSATION DEFIANTLY
8747-293952-0102 YES SWEET LADY DON'T TALK LIKE THAT CHILD CALL ME MA'AM
8747-293952-0103 MISTER BERYL SUCH A KIND GENTLEMAN MA'AM SAID YOU WOULD HELP ME I WILL SO LONG AS YOU ARE HONEST JERRY THRUST HIS TONGUE IN HIS CHEEK BUT JULIUS ANSWERED
8747-293952-0104 I CAN VOUCH FOR HIS HONESTY HE SAID BUT HE TALKS TOO MUCH HE MUST HOLD HIS TONGUE HERE SAID THE OLD DAME SEVERELY AND SHAKING HER TROWEL AT THE BOY WHERE ARE HIS CLOTHES I HAVE NONE BUT WHAT'S ON CRIED JERRY
8747-293952-0105 THE KIND GENTLEMAN GOT THEM FOR ME MA'AM YOU ARE A BETTER CHRISTIAN THAN I THOUGHT SAID MISS BERENGARIA LOOKING AT BERYL WELL YOU CAN STAY HERE BOY GO TO THE KITCHEN AND TELL THE SERVANTS TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO EAT
8747-293952-0106 JERRY GRINNED AND DUCKED TOWARDS THE DOOR GOOD BYE JERRY SAID BERYL KINDLY DON'T FORGET ME IF I DO MAY I BE OH NO KIND LADY I MEAN MA'AM I WON'T SWEAR
8747-293952-0107 I NEVER DID HAVING BEEN TO SUNDAY SCHOOL YES MA'AM I'M GOING AND JERRY IN ANSWER TO AN IMPERATIVE WAVE OF HIS NEW MISTRESS'S HAND DISAPPEARED MISS BERENGARIA TURNED TO BERYL
8747-293952-0108 I MUST SEE THAT HE DOESN'T SWEAR OR SMOKE OR INDULGE IN ANY OF THOSE WICKED THINGS I HOPE HE WILL DO YOUR RECOMMENDATION CREDIT MISTER BERYL I HOPE HE WILL SAID JULIUS AND FELT A STRONG INCLINATION
8747-293952-0109 THEN HE TOOK HIS LEAVE AND THE OLD LADY WATCHED HIM GO
8770-295462-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN HOW EMANCIPATION CAME TO PASS WHEN ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS A SMALL BOY HE BEGAN TO SHOW THE KEENEST SYMPATHY FOR THE HELPLESS AND OPPRESSED THE ONLY TIME HE BETRAYED ANGER AS A CHILD
8770-295462-0001 WHEN HE SAW THE OTHER BOYS HURTING A MUD TURTLE IN HIS FIRST SCHOOL COMPOSITION ON CRUELTY TO ANIMALS HIS STEPSISTER REMEMBERS THIS SENTENCE AN ANT'S LIFE IS AS SWEET TO IT
8770-295462-0002 AS OURS IS TO US AS YOU HAVE READ ON AN EARLIER PAGE WHEN ABE GREW TO BE A BIG STRONG BOY HE SAVED A DRUNKEN MAN FROM FREEZING IN THE MUD BY CARRYING HIM TO A CABIN
8770-295462-0003 NOT ONLY FROM MUD AND COLD BUT ALSO FROM A DRUNKARD'S GRAVE FOR THAT TALL LAD'S LOVE AND MERCY REVEALED TO THE POOR CREATURE THE TERRIBLE SLAVERY OF WHICH HE WAS THE VICTIM
8770-295462-0004 HE DELIVERED AN ADDRESS BEFORE THE WASHINGTONIAN TEMPERANCE SOCIETY IN WHICH HE COMPARED WHITE SLAVERY WITH BLACK IN WHICH HE SAID AND WHEN THE VICTORY SHALL BE COMPLETE
8770-295462-0005 THIS IS THE ONE HUNDRED AND TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH OF WASHINGTON WE ARE MET TO CELEBRATE THIS DAY WASHINGTON IS THE MIGHTIEST NAME OF EARTH LONG SINCE THE MIGHTIEST IN THE CAUSE OF CIVIL LIBERTY
8770-295462-0006 STILL MIGHTIEST IN MORAL REFORMATION ON THAT NAME NO EULOGY IS EXPECTED IT CANNOT BE TO ADD TO THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE SUN OR GLORY TO THE NAME OF WASHINGTON IS ALIKE IMPOSSIBLE
8770-295462-0007 WHICH DID SO MUCH TO BRING ABOUT IN TIME A DOUBLE EMANCIPATION FROM WHITE SLAVERY AND BLACK ONCE AS PRESIDENT HE SAID TO A BOY WHO HAD JUST SIGNED THE TEMPERANCE PLEDGE NOW SONNY
8770-295462-0008 KEEP THAT PLEDGE AND IT WILL BE THE BEST ACT OF YOUR LIFE PRESIDENT LINCOLN WAS TRUE AND CONSISTENT IN HIS TEMPERANCE PRINCIPLES IN MARCH EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR HE WENT BY STEAMBOAT WITH HIS WIFE
8770-295462-0009 AND LITTLE TAD TO VISIT GENERAL GRANT AT HIS HEADQUARTERS AT CITY POINT VIRGINIA WHEN ASKED HOW HE WAS DURING THE RECEPTION WHICH FOLLOWED HIS ARRIVAL THERE THE PRESIDENT SAID AS RELATED BY GENERAL HORACE PORTER
8770-295462-0010 THAT'S THE BEST REMEDY I KNOW OF FOR SEA SICKNESS NO NO MY YOUNG FRIEND REPLIED THE PRESIDENT I'VE SEEN MANY A MAN IN MY TIME SEASICK ASHORE FROM DRINKING THAT VERY ARTICLE
8770-295462-0011 AND THE BITTEREST NAME HIS ENEMIES CALLED HIM WORSE IN THEIR MINDS THAN FOOL CLOWN IMBECILE OR GORILLA WAS A BLACK REPUBLICAN
8770-295462-0012 THE MORE THEY NEEDED HIS SYMPATHETIC HELP THE MORE CERTAIN THEY WERE TO RECEIVE IT MY SYMPATHIES ARE WITH THE UNDER DOG SAID MISTER LINCOLN ONE DAY THOUGH IT IS OFTEN THAT DOG THAT STARTS THE FUSS
8770-295462-0013 DID NOT MAKE HIM FORFEIT ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S SYMPATHY THAT WAS ONLY A GOOD LESSON TO HIM TO LOOK OUT AND DO BETTER NEXT TIME THE QUESTION OF EMANCIPATION
8770-295462-0014 IF THE GOVERNMENT COULD NOT BACK UP SUCH A DECLARATION THE OTHER PARTY DID NOT WISH THE MATTER TAMPERED WITH AS CHEAP LABOR WAS NECESSARY FOR RAISING COTTON SUGAR AND OTHER PRODUCTS ON WHICH THE LIVING OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DEPENDED
8770-295462-0015 THE EXTREME ABOLITIONISTS WHO WISHED SLAVERY ABOLISHED WHETHER OR NO SENT MEN TO TELL THE PRESIDENT THAT IF HE DID NOT FREE THE SLAVES HE WAS A COWARD AND A TURNCOAT
8770-295462-0016 AND THEY WOULD WITHHOLD THEIR SUPPORT FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMY DELEGATIONS OF ABOLITIONISTS FROM ALL OVER THE NORTH ARRIVED ALMOST DAILY FROM DIFFERENT CITIES TO URGE COAX AND THREATEN THE PRESIDENT
8770-295462-0017 WASHINGTON THE NATIONAL CAPITAL WOULD HAVE BEEN SURROUNDED AND FORCED TO SURRENDER BESIDES AT THIS TIME THE ARMIES OF THE NORTH WERE LOSING NEARLY ALL THE BATTLES
8770-295462-0018 IT WOULD BE LIKE THE POPE'S BULL OR DECREE AGAINST THE COMET A DELEGATION OF CHICAGO MINISTERS CAME TO BEG MISTER LINCOLN TO FREE THE SLAVES HE PATIENTLY EXPLAINED TO THEM
8770-295462-0019 COMPELS ME TO SAY TO YOU IN REPLY THAT IT IS A MESSAGE FROM OUR DIVINE MASTER THROUGH ME COMMANDING YOU SIR TO OPEN THE DOORS OF BONDAGE
8770-295462-0020 NOW ISN'T THAT STRANGE THE PRESIDENT REPLIED INSTANTLY HERE I AM STUDYING THIS QUESTION DAY AND NIGHT AND GOD HAS PLACED IT UPON ME TOO
8770-295462-0021 DON'T YOU THINK IT'S RATHER ODD THAT HE SHOULD SEND SUCH A MESSAGE BY WAY OF THAT AWFUL WICKED CITY OF CHICAGO THE MINISTERS WERE SHOCKED AT SUCH AN ANSWER FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
8770-295462-0022 THEY COULD NOT KNOW FOR MISTER LINCOLN DARED NOT TELL THEM THAT HE HAD THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION IN HIS POCKET WAITING FOR A FEDERAL VICTORY BEFORE HE COULD ISSUE IT THE PROCLAMATION
8770-295462-0023 THEN CAME THE NEWS OF ANTIETAM A TERRIBLE BATTLE BUT GAINED BY THE NORTHERN ARMS AT LAST THE TIME HAD COME TO ANNOUNCE THE FREEING OF THE SLAVES THAT THEY MIGHT HELP IN WINNING THEIR LIBERTIES
8770-295462-0024 THE PRESIDENT HAD NOT HELD A MEETING OF HIS CABINET FOR SOME TIME HE THOUGHT OF THE OCCASION WHEN AS A YOUNG MAN HE WENT ON A FLATBOAT TRIP TO NEW ORLEANS AND SAW
8770-295462-0025 I'LL HIT IT HARD NOW THE CHANCE TO HIT THAT THING THE INHUMAN MONSTER OF HUMAN SLAVERY HAD COME AND HE WAS GOING TO HIT IT HARD HE CALLED THE CABINET TOGETHER
8770-295462-0026 EDWIN M STANTON THE SECRETARY OF WAR HAS DESCRIBED THE SCENE ON THE TWENTY SECOND OF SEPTEMBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO I HAD A SUDDEN AND PEREMPTORY CALL TO A CABINET MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE
8770-295462-0027 I WENT IMMEDIATELY AND FOUND THE HISTORIC WAR CABINET OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN ASSEMBLED EVERY MEMBER BEING PRESENT THE PRESIDENT HARDLY NOTICED ME AS I CAME IN
8770-295462-0028 LET ME READ YOU A CHAPTER THAT IS VERY FUNNY NOT A MEMBER OF THE CABINET SMILED AS FOR MYSELF I WAS ANGRY AND LOOKED TO SEE WHAT THE PRESIDENT MEANT IT SEEMED TO ME LIKE BUFFOONERY
8770-295462-0029 HE HOWEVER CONCLUDED TO READ US A CHAPTER FROM ARTEMUS WARD WHICH HE DID WITH GREAT DELIBERATION HAVING FINISHED HE LAUGHED HEARTILY WITHOUT A MEMBER OF THE CABINET JOINING IN THE LAUGHTER
8770-295462-0030 WELL HE SAID LET'S HAVE ANOTHER CHAPTER I WAS CONSIDERING WHETHER I SHOULD RISE AND LEAVE THE MEETING ABRUPTLY WHEN HE THREW THE BOOK DOWN HEAVED A LONG SIGH AND SAID
8770-295462-0031 GENTLEMEN WHY DON'T YOU LAUGH WITH THE FEARFUL STRAIN THAT IS UPON ME NIGHT AND DAY IF I DID NOT LAUGH I SHOULD DIE AND YOU NEED THIS MEDICINE AS MUCH AS I DO
8770-295462-0032 HE THEN PUT HIS HAND IN HIS TALL HAT THAT SAT UPON THE TABLE AND PULLED OUT A LITTLE PAPER TURNING TO THE MEMBERS OF THE CABINET HE SAID GENTLEMEN I HAVE CALLED YOU HERE UPON VERY IMPORTANT BUSINESS
8770-295462-0033 IT IS DUE TO MY CABINET THAT YOU SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO HEAR AND KNOW OF IT AND IF ANY OF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS TO MAKE AS TO THE FORM OF THIS PAPER OR ITS COMPOSITION I SHALL BE GLAD TO HEAR THEM
8770-295462-0034 WHICH WAS TO TAKE EFFECT THE FIRST OF JANUARY FOLLOWING SECRETARY STANTON CONTINUED I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO BE CALM BUT I THINK I LOST MY CALMNESS FOR A MOMENT AND WITH GREAT ENTHUSIASM I AROSE
8770-295462-0035 APPROACHED THE PRESIDENT EXTENDED MY HAND AND SAID MISTER PRESIDENT IF THE READING OF CHAPTERS OF ARTEMUS WARD IS A PRELUDE TO SUCH A DEED AS THIS THE BOOK SHOULD BE FILED AMONG THE ARCHIVES OF THE NATION
8770-295462-0036 AND THE AUTHOR SHOULD BE CANONIZED HENCEFORTH I SEE THE LIGHT AND THE COUNTRY IS SAVED AND ALL SAID AMEN AND LINCOLN SAID TO ME IN A DROLL WAY JUST AS I WAS LEAVING
8770-295462-0037 THAT DECLARATION YOUNG ABE LINCOLN FIRST READ IN THE GENTRYVILLE CONSTABLE'S COPY OF THE STATUTES OF INDIANA AT NOON ON THE FIRST OF JANUARY EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
8770-295462-0038 WILLIAM H SEWARD SECRETARY OF STATE WITH HIS SON FREDERICK CALLED AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH THE EMANCIPATION DOCUMENT TO BE SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT IT WAS JUST AFTER THE REGULAR NEW YEAR'S DAY RECEPTION
8770-295462-0039 MISTER LINCOLN SEATED HIMSELF AT HIS TABLE TOOK UP THE PEN DIPPED IT IN THE INK HELD THE PEN A MOMENT THEN LAID IT DOWN AFTER WAITING A WHILE HE WENT THROUGH THE SAME MOVEMENTS AS BEFORE
8770-295462-0040 TURNING TO HIS SECRETARY OF STATE HE SAID TO EXPLAIN HIS HESITATION
8770-295462-0041 LOOKING UP AT THE SEWARDS FATHER AND SON HE SMILED AND SAID WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF
8770-295463-0000 CHAPTER NINETEEN THE GLORY OF GETTYSBURG THE BATTLE
8770-295463-0001 IF LEE HAD BEEN VICTORIOUS THERE HE MIGHT HAVE DESTROYED PHILADELPHIA AND NEW YORK BY SUCH A BRILLIANT STROKE HE COULD HAVE SURROUNDED AND CAPTURED BALTIMORE AND WASHINGTON THIS WOULD HAVE CHANGED THE GRAND RESULT OF THE WAR
8770-295463-0002 IN POINT OF NUMBERS BRAVERY AND GENIUS THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG WAS THE GREATEST THAT HAD EVER BEEN FOUGHT UP TO THAT TIME GLORIOUS AS THIS WAS
8770-295463-0003 THE GREATEST GLORY OF GETTYSBURG LAY IN THE EXPERIENCES AND UTTERANCES OF ONE MAN ABRAHAM LINCOLN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IT CAME AT A TERRIBLE TIME IN THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR
8770-295463-0004 ACCOUNTED VICTORY ENOUGH FOR THE PRESIDENT TO ISSUE HIS EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION PROVED TO BE A DRAWN BATTLE WITH TERRIFIC LOSSES ON BOTH SIDES LEE WAS DRIVEN BACK FROM MARYLAND THEN IT IS TRUE
8770-295463-0005 BUT HE SOON WON THE GREAT BATTLES OF FREDERICKSBURG AND CHANCELLORSVILLE AND HAD MADE HIS WAY NORTH INTO PENNSYLVANIA THE NIGHT AFTER THE BATTLE OF CHANCELLORSVILLE
8770-295463-0006 WAS THE DARKEST IN THE HISTORY OF THE CIVIL WAR PRESIDENT LINCOLN WALKED THE FLOOR THE WHOLE NIGHT LONG CRYING OUT IN HIS ANGUISH O WHAT WILL THE COUNTRY SAY
8770-295463-0007 AFTER WINNING THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG WHICH THE PRESIDENT HOPED WOULD END THE WAR GENERAL MEADE INSTEAD OF ANNOUNCING THAT HE HAD CAPTURED THE CONFEDERATE ARMY STATED THAT HE HAD DRIVEN THE INVADERS FROM OUR SOIL
8770-295463-0008 BELIEVING HE WAS ON GOD'S SIDE HE FELT THAT THE CAUSE OF RIGHT COULD NOT LOSE FOR THE LORD WOULD SAVE HIS OWN THE NEXT DAY JULY FOURTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE CAME THE SURRENDER OF VICKSBURG
8770-295463-0009 THE STRONGHOLD OF THE GREAT WEST
8770-295463-0010 CALLING ON GENERAL SICKLES IN A WASHINGTON HOSPITAL FOR THE GENERAL HAD LOST A LEG ON THE SECOND DAY OF THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED WHY HE BELIEVED THAT VICTORY WOULD BE GIVEN THE FEDERAL FORCES AT GETTYSBURG
8770-295463-0011 I WILL TELL YOU HOW IT WAS IN THE PINCH OF YOUR CAMPAIGN UP THERE WHEN EVERYBODY SEEMED PANIC STRICKEN
8770-295463-0012 THAT IF HE WOULD STAND BY OUR BOYS AT GETTYSBURG I WOULD STAND BY HIM AND HE DID AND I WILL THE PRESIDENT'S CALL ON GENERAL SICKLES WAS ON THE SUNDAY AFTER THE THREE DAYS BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG
8770-295463-0013 BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF THE GUNBOAT AT CAIRO ILLINOIS WITH THE GLAD TIDINGS FROM VICKSBURG WHICH ADDED NEW LUSTER TO THE PATRIOTIC JOY OF INDEPENDENCE DAY THE TELEGRAPH WIRES
8770-295463-0014 HAD BEEN SO GENERALLY CUT ON ALL SIDES OF VICKSBURG THAT THE NEWS WAS SENT TO CAIRO AND TELEGRAPHED TO WASHINGTON IN PROOF THAT HIS FAITH EVEN INCLUDED THE MISSISSIPPI BLOCKADE HE WENT ON BESIDES
8770-295463-0015 I HAVE BEEN PRAYING OVER VICKSBURG ALSO AND BELIEVE OUR HEAVENLY FATHER IS GOING TO GIVE US VICTORY THERE TOO BECAUSE WE NEED IT IN ORDER TO BISECT THE CONFEDERACY
8770-295463-0016 PROMINENT IN NATIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL AFFAIRS AND THE GREATEST LIVING ORATOR WAS INVITED TO DELIVER THE GRAND ORATION THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED IF HE COULD TO COME AND MAKE A FEW DEDICATORY REMARKS
8770-295463-0017 BUT MISTER EVERETT WAS TO BE THE CHIEF SPEAKER OF THE OCCASION THE SUNDAY BEFORE THE NINETEENTH OF NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE THE DATE OF THE DEDICATION THE PRESIDENT WENT WITH HIS FRIEND NOAH BROOKS
8770-295463-0018 TO GARDNER'S GALLERY IN WASHINGTON WHERE HE HAD PROMISED TO SIT FOR HIS PHOTOGRAPH WHILE THERE HE SHOWED MISTER BROOKS A PROOF OF EVERETT'S ORATION WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM AS THIS PRINTED ADDRESS COVERED TWO NEWSPAPER PAGES
8770-295463-0019 WHEN MISTER BROOKS ASKED ABOUT HIS SPEECH FOR THAT OCCASION MISTER LINCOLN REPLIED I'VE GOT IT WRITTEN BUT NOT LICKED INTO SHAPE YET IT'S SHORT SHORT SHORT
8770-295463-0020 DURING THE FORENOON OF THE EIGHTEENTH SECRETARY JOHN HAY WAS ANXIOUS LEST THE PRESIDENT BE LATE FOR THE SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL TRAIN WHICH WAS TO LEAVE AT NOON FOR GETTYSBURG DON'T WORRY JOHN SAID MISTER LINCOLN
8770-295463-0021 DON'T HURRY BOYS THERE WON'T BE ANYTHING GOING ON TILL I GET THERE WHEN THE TRAIN STOPPED ON THE WAY TO GETTYSBURG A LITTLE GIRL ON THE PLATFORM HELD UP A BOUQUET TO MISTER LINCOLN LISPING FLOWERTH FOR THE PRETHIDENT
8770-295463-0022 HE REACHED OUT TOOK HER UP AND KISSED HER SAYING YOU'RE A SWEET LITTLE ROSEBUD YOURSELF I HOPE YOUR LIFE WILL OPEN INTO PERPETUAL BEAUTY AND GOODNESS
8770-295463-0023 ABOUT NOON ON THE NINETEENTH OF NOVEMBER THE DISTINGUISHED PARTY ARRIVED IN A PROCESSION AND TOOK SEATS ON THE PLATFORM ERECTED FOR THE EXERCISES THE PRESIDENT WAS SEATED IN A ROCKING CHAIR PLACED THERE FOR HIM
8770-295463-0024 THERE WERE FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WAITING
8770-295463-0025 WATCHING HER WHILE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS FANNING HER TENDERLY THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR HER SHE GASPED I FEEL BETTER NOW I WANT TO GO BACK TO MY HUSBAND
8770-295463-0026 THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS SPEAKING WAS SUFFICIENT NO MATTER WHAT HE SAID THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE APPLAUDED ABRAHAM LINCOLN IF HE HAD MERELY RECITED THE MULTIPLICATION TABLE
8770-295463-0027 WHICH THE PRESIDENT DECIDED TO ATTEND TAKING SECRETARY SEWARD WITH HIM HE CALLED ON AN OLD COBBLER NAMED JOHN BURNS OF WHOSE COURAGE IN THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG MISTER LINCOLN HAD JUST HEARD
8770-295465-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE LIEUTENANT TAD LINCOLN PATRIOT THERE WAS NO MORE STURDY LITTLE PATRIOT IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY THAN LIEUTENANT TAD LINCOLN THE CHILD OF THE NATION
8770-295465-0001 NOR HAD THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES A MORE DEVOTED ADMIRER AND FOLLOWER THAN HIS OWN SMALL SON A WORD FROM HIS FATHER WOULD MELT THE LAD TO TEARS AND SUBMISSION OR BRING HIM OUT OF A NERVOUS TANTRUM WITH HIS
8770-295465-0002 WREATHED WITH SMILES AND A CHUCKLING IN HIS THROAT OF PAPA DAY MY PAPA DAY NO ONE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THE BOY MEANT BY PAPA DAY IT WAS HIS PET NAME FOR THE DEAREST MAN ON EARTH
8770-295465-0003 AND IT WAS HIS ONLY WAY OF EXPRESSING THE GREATEST PLEASURE HIS BOYISH HEART WAS ABLE TO HOLD IT WAS THE SWEETEST WORD EVER HEARD BY THE WAR BURDENED CRUSHED AND SORROWING SOUL OF THE BROKEN HEARTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
8770-295465-0004 MISTER LINCOLN TOOK HIS YOUNGEST SON WITH HIM EVERYWHERE ON HIS GREAT MISSION TO FORTRESS MONROE AND THEY THE LONG AND THE SHORT OF IT THE SOLDIERS SAID MARCHED HAND IN HAND THROUGH THE STREETS OF FALLEN RICHMOND
8770-295465-0005 BECAME PERFECTLY RIGHT AND PROPER WHEN CERTAIN UNKNOWN FACTS WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WAVING THE STARS AND BARS OUT OF A WHITE HOUSE WINDOW FOR INSTANCE ONE NIGHT
8770-295465-0006 IN A SOLDIER'S UNIFORM IF HE DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER THAN THAT SAID ONE MAN HE SHOULD BE TAUGHT BETTER IT'S AN INSULT TO THE NORTH AND THE PRESIDENT OUGHT TO STOP IT AND APOLOGIZE TOO
8770-295465-0007 BUT THAT HIS HEART WENT OUT ALSO TO THE BOYS IN GRAY THE SOLDIERS WERE ALL BOYS TO HIM THEY KNEW HE LOVED THEM THEY SAID AMONG THEMSELVES HE CARES FOR US HE TAKES OUR PART
8770-295465-0008 WE WILL FIGHT FOR HIM YES WE WILL DIE FOR HIM AND A LARGE PART OF THE COMMON SOLDIER'S PATRIOTISM WAS THIS HEART RESPONSE OF THE BOYS TO THE GREAT BOY IN THE WHITE HOUSE
8770-295465-0009 FOR THE YOUNGER SOLDIERS THE REAL BOYS OF THE ARMY GOING ALWAYS WITH THE PRESIDENT HE HAD HEARD HIS PAPA DAY SAY OF SEVERAL YOUTHS CONDEMNED TO BE SHOT FOR SLEEPING AT THEIR POST OR SOME LIKE OFFENSE
8770-295465-0010 THAT BOY IS WORTH MORE ABOVE GROUND THAN UNDER OR A LIVE BOY CAN SERVE HIS COUNTRY BETTER THAN A DEAD ONE GIVE THE BOYS A CHANCE WAS ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S MOTTO
8770-295465-0011 AND HE WANTED ALL OTHER BOYS TO HAVE A FAIR SHOW HIS OWN FATHER HAD BEEN TOO HARD WITH HIM AND HE WAS GOING TO MAKE IT UP TO ALL THE OTHER BOYS HE COULD REACH THIS PASSION FOR DOING GOOD TO OTHERS
8770-295465-0012 BEGAN IN THE LOG CABIN WHEN HE HAD NO IDEA HE COULD EVER BE EXERCISING HIS LOVING KINDNESS IN THE EXECUTIVE MANSION THE HOME OF THE NATION WITH MALICE TOWARD NONE WITH CHARITY FOR ALL WAS THE RULE OF HIS LIFE
8770-295465-0013 IN THE BACKWOODS AS WELL AS IN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL AND THE BOYS IN GRAY WERE HIS BOYS TOO BUT THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND SO THEY HAD WANDERED AWAY THEY WERE A LITTLE WAYWARD BUT HE WOULD WIN THEM BACK
8770-295465-0014 THE GREAT CHIVALROUS SOUTH HAS LEARNED SINCE THOSE BITTER RUINOUS DAYS THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS THE BEST FRIEND THE SOUTH THEN HAD IN THE NORTH TAD HAD SEEN HIS FATHER SHOW GREAT TENDERNESS TO ALL THE BOYS
8770-295465-0015 HE MET IN THE GRAY UNIFORM BUT THE PRESIDENT HAD FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO SHOW HIS TENDERNESS TO THE SOUTH THOUGH THERE WAS A SECRET PIGEONHOLE IN HIS DESK STUFFED FULL OF THREATS OF ASSASSINATION HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF DEATH
8770-295465-0016 AND THE COUNTRY ANY GOOD BUT IT HURT HIM DEEP IN HIS HEART TO KNOW THAT SOME OF HIS BELOVED CHILDREN MISUNDERSTOOD HIM SO THAT THEY WERE WILLING TO KILL HIM IT WAS NO ONE'S BULLET WHICH MADE ABRAHAM LINCOLN A MARTYR
8770-295465-0017 ALL HIS LIFE HE HAD SHOWN THE SPIRIT OF LOVE WHICH WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS VERY LIFE IF IT COULD SAVE OR HELP OTHERS ALL THESE THINGS LITTLE TAD COULD NOT HAVE EXPLAINED
8770-295465-0018 BUT THEY WERE INBRED INTO THE DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE BIG FATHER AND THE SMALL SON WHO WERE LIVING IN THE WHITE HOUSE AS BOYS TOGETHER
8770-295465-0019 MISTER LINCOLN HAD WRITTEN A SHORT ADDRESS FOR THE OCCASION THE TIMES WERE SO OUT OF JOINT AND EVERY WORD WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT THE PRESIDENT COULD NOT TRUST HIMSELF TO SPEAK OFF HAND A FRIEND STEPPED OUT ON THE NORTHERN PORTICO WITH HIM
8770-295465-0020 TO HOLD THE CANDLE BY WHICH MISTER LINCOLN WAS TO READ HIS SPEECH LITTLE TAD WAS WITH HIS FATHER AS USUAL AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT HAD FINISHED READING A PAGE OF HIS MANUSCRIPT HE LET IT FLUTTER DOWN LIKE A LEAF OR A BIG WHITE BUTTERFLY
8770-295465-0021 FOR TAD TO CATCH WHEN THE PAGES CAME TOO SLOWLY THE BOY PULLED HIS FATHER'S COAT TAIL PIPING UP IN A MUFFLED EXCITED TONE GIVE ME NOTHER PAPER PAPA DAY
8770-295465-0022 IT SEEMED RIDICULOUS THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SHOULD ALLOW ANY CHILD TO BEHAVE LIKE THAT AND HAMPER HIM WHILE DELIVERING A GREAT ADDRESS WHICH WOULD WIELD A NATIONAL IF NOT WORLD WIDE INFLUENCE
8770-295465-0023 WE MEET THIS EVENING NOT IN SORROW BUT GLADNESS OF HEART THE EVACUATION OF PETERSBURG AND RICHMOND AND THE SURRENDER OF THE PRINCIPAL INSURGENT ARMY AT APPOMATTOX GIVE HOPE OF A RIGHTEOUS AND SPEEDY PEACE
8770-295465-0024 AND WILL BE DULY PROMULGATED GIVE US DIXIE BOYS THEN HE WENT ON OUTLINING A POLICY OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TOWARD THE SOUTH SHOWING A SPIRIT FAR HIGHER
8770-295465-0025 AND MORE ADVANCED THAN THAT OF THE LISTENING CROWD ON CONCLUDING HIS ADDRESS AND BIDDING THE ASSEMBLED MULTITUDE GOOD NIGHT HE TURNED TO THE SERENADING BAND AND SHOUTED JOYOUSLY GIVE US DIXIE BOYS PLAY DIXIE
8770-295465-0026 WE HAVE A RIGHT TO THAT TUNE NOW THERE WAS A MOMENT OF SILENCE SOME OF THE PEOPLE GASPED AS THEY HAD DONE WHEN THEY SAW TAD WAVING THE CONFEDERATE FLAG AT THE WINDOW
8770-295465-0027 AS MISTER LINCOLN CAME IN THROUGH THE DOOR AFTER SPEAKING TO THE CROWD MISSUS LINCOLN WHO HAD BEEN WITH A GROUP OF FRIENDS LOOKING ON FROM WITHIN EXCLAIMED TO HIM YOU MUST NOT BE SO CARELESS
8770-295465-0028 SOME ONE COULD EASILY HAVE SHOT YOU WHILE YOU WERE SPEAKING THERE AND YOU KNOW THEY ARE THREATENING YOUR LIFE THE PRESIDENT SMILED AT HIS WIFE THROUGH A LOOK OF INEXPRESSIBLE PAIN AND SADNESS AND SHRUGGED HIS GREAT SHOULDERS
8770-295465-0029 BUT STILL HE ANSWERED NOT A WORD THE SEPARATION OF THE TWO BOYS AT A LATE HOUR GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT THAT SAME WEEK LITTLE TAD CAME IN ALONE AT A BASEMENT DOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE FROM THE NATIONAL THEATER
8770-295465-0030 AND SOME OF THE COMPANY HAD MADE A GREAT PET OF HIM
8770-295465-0031 LIKE A WOUNDED ANIMAL SEEING THOMAS PENDEL THE FAITHFUL DOORKEEPER HE WAILED FROM HIS BREAKING HEART TOM PEN TOM PEN THEY HAVE KILLED PAPA DAY THEY HAVE KILLED MY PAPA DAY
8770-295465-0032 AND NOW HIS MOTHER WAS DESPERATELY ILL AND HIS FATHER HAD BEEN KILLED TAD OF COURSE COULD NOT COMPREHEND WHY ANY ONE COULD BE SO CRUEL AND WICKED AS TO WISH TO MURDER HIS DARLING PAPA DAY
8770-295465-0033 WHO LOVED EVERY ONE SO HE WANDERED THROUGH THE EMPTY ROOMS ACHING WITH LONELINESS MURMURING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF PAPA DAY WHERE'S MY PAPA DAY I'M TIRED
8770-295465-0034 TIRED OF PLAYING ALONE I WANT TO PLAY TOGETHER PLEASE PAPA DAY COME BACK AND PLAY WITH YOUR LITTLE TAD YOUNG THOUGH HE WAS HE COULD NOT SLEEP LONG AT NIGHT
8770-295465-0035 HIS SENSE OF LONELINESS PENETRATED HIS DREAMS SOMETIMES HE WOULD CHUCKLE AND GURGLE IN AN ECSTACY AS HE HAD DONE WHEN RIDING ON HIS FATHER'S BACK ROMPING THROUGH THE STATELY ROOMS
8770-295465-0036 TAD OPENED HIS EYES WIDE WITH WONDER IS PAPA DAY HAPPY IN HEAVEN HE ASKED EAGERLY YES YES I'M SURE HE'S HAPPY THERE TADDIE DEAR NOW GO TO SLEEP
8770-295465-0037 PAPA DAY'S HAPPY I'M GLAD SO GLAD SIGHED THE LITTLE BOY FOR PAPA DAY NEVER WAS HAPPY HERE THEN HE FELL INTO HIS FIRST SWEET SLEEP SINCE THAT TERRIBLE NIGHT
8770-295465-0038 GIVE THE BOYS A CHANCE THE FOND HEARTED LITTLE FELLOW WENT ABROAD WITH HIS MOTHER A FEW YEARS AFTER THE TRAGEDY THAT BROKE BOTH THEIR LIVES BY A SURGICAL OPERATION AND BY STRUGGLING MANFULLY
8770-295465-0039 HE HAD CORRECTED THE IMPERFECTION IN HIS SPEECH BUT THE HEART OF LITTLE TAD HAD BEEN BROKEN WHILE STILL A LAD HE JOINED HIS FOND FATHER IN THE BEYOND GIVE THE BOYS A CHANCE HAD AMOUNTED TO A PASSION WITH ABRAHAM LINCOLN
8770-295465-0040 FOR THIS AS FOR ALL THE INEQUITIES THE GREAT HEART OF THE WHITE HOUSE WAS PREPARED HIS SPIRIT HAD SHONE THROUGH HIS WHOLE LIFE AS IF IN LETTERS OF LIVING FIRE WITH MALICE TOWARD NONE WITH CHARITY FOR ALL
8797-294123-0000 TO ACHIEVE A CORRECT APPRECIATION OF THE CHINESE
8797-294123-0001 AND THEN ONE FINE DAY CROSS OVER THE YALU INTO MANCHURIA IT WOULD BE OF EXCEPTIONAL ADVANTAGE TO THE CORRECTNESS OF APPRECIATION DID HE CROSS OVER THE YALU ON THE HEELS OF A HOSTILE AND ALIEN ARMY
8797-294123-0002 WAR IS TO DAY THE FINAL ARBITER IN THE AFFAIRS OF MEN AND IT IS AS YET THE FINAL TEST OF THE WORTH WHILENESS OF PEOPLES TESTED THUS THE KOREAN FAILS
8797-294123-0003 HE LACKS THE NERVE TO REMAIN WHEN A STRANGE ARMY CROSSES HIS LAND THE FEW GOODS AND CHATTELS HE MAY HAVE MANAGED TO ACCUMULATE HE PUTS ON HIS BACK ALONG WITH HIS DOORS AND WINDOWS AND AWAY HE HEADS FOR HIS MOUNTAIN FASTNESSES
8797-294123-0004 LATER HE MAY RETURN SANS GOODS CHATTELS DOORS AND WINDOWS IMPELLED BY INSATIABLE CURIOSITY FOR A LOOK SEE BUT IT IS CURIOSITY MERELY A TIMID DEERLIKE CURIOSITY
8797-294123-0005 HE IS PREPARED TO BOUND AWAY ON HIS LONG LEGS AT THE FIRST HINT OF DANGER OR TROUBLE NORTHERN KOREA WAS A DESOLATE LAND WHEN THE JAPANESE PASSED THROUGH VILLAGES AND TOWNS WERE DESERTED
8797-294123-0006 THE FIELDS LAY UNTOUCHED THERE WAS NO PLOUGHING NOR SOWING NO GREEN THINGS GROWING LITTLE OR NOTHING WAS TO BE PURCHASED ONE CARRIED ONE'S OWN FOOD WITH HIM
8797-294123-0007 IN MANY A LONELY VILLAGE NOT AN OUNCE NOR A GRAIN OF ANYTHING COULD BE BOUGHT AND YET THERE MIGHT BE STANDING AROUND SCORES OF WHITE GARMENTED STALWART KOREANS SMOKING YARD LONG PIPES AND CHATTERING CHATTERING CEASELESSLY CHATTERING
8797-294123-0008 LOVE MONEY OR FORCE COULD NOT PROCURE FROM THEM A HORSESHOE OR A HORSESHOE NAIL UPSO WAS THEIR INVARIABLE REPLY UPSO CURSED WORD WHICH MEANS HAVE NOT GOT
8797-294123-0009 THEY HAD TRAMPED PROBABLY FORTY MILES THAT DAY DOWN FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES JUST FOR A LOOK SEE AND FORTY MILES BACK THEY WOULD CHEERFULLY TRAMP CHATTERING ALL THE WAY OVER WHAT THEY HAD SEEN
8797-294123-0010 AND THE GLOOM OF THE LANDSCAPE WILL BE FILLED WITH TALL FLITTING GHOSTS BOUNDING LIKE DEER WITH GREAT SPRINGY STRIDES WHICH ONE CANNOT BUT ENVY THEY HAVE SPLENDID VIGOUR AND FINE BODIES BUT THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED TO BEING BEATEN AND ROBBED WITHOUT PROTEST OR RESISTANCE
8797-294123-0011 BY EVERY CHANCE FOREIGNER WHO ENTERS THEIR COUNTRY FROM THIS NERVELESS FORSAKEN KOREAN LAND I RODE DOWN UPON THE SANDY ISLANDS OF THE YALU FOR WEEKS THESE ISLANDS HAD BEEN THE DREAD BETWEEN THE LINES OF TWO FIGHTING ARMIES
8797-294123-0012 THE AIR ABOVE HAD BEEN RENT BY SCREAMING PROJECTILES THE ECHOES OF THE FINAL BATTLE HAD SCARCELY DIED AWAY THE TRAINS OF JAPANESE WOUNDED AND JAPANESE DEAD WERE TRAILING BY
8797-294123-0013 ON THE CONICAL HILL A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY THE RUSSIAN DEAD WERE BEING BURIED IN THEIR TRENCHES AND IN THE SHELL HOLES MADE BY THE JAPANESE AND HERE IN THE THICK OF IT ALL A MAN WAS PLOUGHING GREEN THINGS WERE GROWING
8797-294123-0014 YOUNG ONIONS AND THE MAN WHO WAS WEEDING THEM PAUSED FROM HIS LABOUR LONG ENOUGH TO SELL ME A HANDFUL NEAR BY WAS THE SMOKE BLACKENED RUIN OF THE FARMHOUSE FIRED BY THE RUSSIANS WHEN THEY RETREATED FROM THE RIVERBED TWO MEN WERE REMOVING THE DEBRIS
8797-294123-0015 CLEANING THE CONFUSION PREPARATORY TO REBUILDING THEY WERE CLAD IN BLUE PIGTAILS HUNG DOWN THEIR BACKS I WAS IN CHINA I RODE TO THE SHORE INTO THE VILLAGE OF KUELIAN CHING
8797-294123-0016 THERE WERE NO LOUNGING MEN SMOKING LONG PIPES AND CHATTERING THE PREVIOUS DAY THE RUSSIANS HAD BEEN THERE A BLOODY BATTLE HAD BEEN FOUGHT AND TO DAY THE JAPANESE WERE THERE BUT WHAT WAS THAT TO TALK ABOUT EVERYBODY WAS BUSY
8797-294123-0017 MEN WERE OFFERING EGGS AND CHICKENS AND FRUIT FOR SALE UPON THE STREET AND BREAD AS I LIVE BREAD IN SMALL ROUND LOAVES OR BUNS I RODE ON INTO THE COUNTRY EVERYWHERE A TOILING POPULATION WAS IN EVIDENCE
8797-294123-0018 THE HOUSES AND WALLS WERE STRONG AND SUBSTANTIAL STONE AND BRICK REPLACED THE MUD WALLS OF THE KOREAN DWELLINGS TWILIGHT FELL AND DEEPENED AND STILL THE PLOUGHS WENT UP AND DOWN THE FIELDS THE SOWERS FOLLOWING AFTER
8797-294123-0019 TRAINS OF WHEELBARROWS HEAVILY LOADED SQUEAKED BY AND PEKIN CARTS DRAWN BY FROM FOUR TO SIX COWS HORSES MULES PONIES OR JACKASSES COWS EVEN WITH THEIR NEWBORN CALVES TOTTERING ALONG ON PUNY LEGS OUTSIDE THE TRACES

8797-294123-0027 TO WASH OUT FROM MY THROAT THE DUST OF AN ARMY IT WAS THE LAND OF CANAAN I WAS IN CHINA THE KOREAN IS THE PERFECT TYPE OF INEFFICIENCY OF UTTER WORTHLESSNESS
8797-294123-0028 THE CHINESE IS THE PERFECT TYPE OF INDUSTRY FOR SHEER WORK NO WORKER IN THE WORLD CAN COMPARE WITH HIM WORK IS THE BREATH OF HIS NOSTRILS IT IS HIS SOLUTION OF EXISTENCE
8797-294123-0029 LIBERTY TO HIM EPITOMIZES ITSELF IN ACCESS TO THE MEANS OF TOIL TO TILL THE SOIL AND LABOUR INTERMINABLY WITH RUDE IMPLEMENTS AND UTENSILS IS ALL HE ASKS OF LIFE AND OF THE POWERS THAT BE
8797-294123-0030 WORK IS WHAT HE DESIRES ABOVE ALL THINGS AND HE WILL WORK AT ANYTHING FOR ANYBODY DURING THE TAKING OF THE TAKU FORTS HE CARRIED SCALING LADDERS AT THE HEADS OF THE STORMING COLUMNS AND PLANTED THEM AGAINST THE WALLS
8797-294123-0031 HE DID THIS NOT FROM A SENSE OF PATRIOTISM BUT FOR THE INVADING FOREIGN DEVILS BECAUSE THEY PAID HIM A DAILY WAGE OF FIFTY CENTS HE IS NOT FRIGHTENED BY WAR HE ACCEPTS IT AS HE DOES RAIN AND SUNSHINE THE CHANGING OF THE SEASONS AND OTHER NATURAL PHENOMENA
8797-294123-0032 HE PREPARES FOR IT ENDURES IT AND SURVIVES IT AND WHEN THE TIDE OF BATTLE SWEEPS BY

8797-294123-0035 HE DOES NOT HIDE AWAY HIS CHICKENS AND HIS EGGS NOR ANY OTHER COMMODITY HE POSSESSES HE PROCEEDS AT ONCE TO OFFER THEM FOR SALE NOR IS HE TO BE BULLIED INTO LOWERING HIS PRICE
8797-294123-0036 HE HAS TWO LARGE PEARS SAVED OVER FROM LAST YEAR WHICH HE WILL SELL FOR FIVE SEN OR FOR THE SAME PRICE THREE SMALL PEARS WHAT IF ONE SOLDIER PERSIST IN TAKING AWAY WITH HIM THREE LARGE PEARS WHAT IF THERE BE TWENTY OTHER SOLDIERS JOSTLING ABOUT HIM
8797-294123-0037 AND THE SOLDIER RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR FLIGHT
8797-294123-0038 NOR IS THE CHINESE THE TYPE OF PERMANENCE WHICH HE HAS BEEN SO OFTEN DESIGNATED HE IS NOT SO ILL DISPOSED TOWARD NEW IDEAS AND NEW METHODS AS HIS HISTORY WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE TRUE
8797-294123-0039 HIS FORMS CUSTOMS AND METHODS HAVE BEEN PERMANENT THESE MANY CENTURIES BUT THIS HAS BEEN DUE TO THE FACT THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE LEARNED CLASSES AND THAT THESE GOVERNING SCHOLARS FOUND THEIR SALVATION LAY IN SUPPRESSING ALL PROGRESSIVE IDEAS
8797-294123-0040 AND BEEN SPREAD BY THEIR PAMPHLETS AND PROPAGANDISTS ORIGINALITY AND ENTERPRISE HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED IN THE CHINESE FOR SCORES OF GENERATIONS ONLY HAS REMAINED TO HIM INDUSTRY
8797-294123-0041 ON THE OTHER HAND HIS SUSCEPTIBILITY TO NEW IDEAS HAS BEEN WELL DEMONSTRATED WHEREVER HE HAS ESCAPED BEYOND THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED UPON HIM BY HIS GOVERNMENT SO FAR AS THE BUSINESS MAN IS CONCERNED HE HAS GRASPED FAR MORE CLEARLY THE WESTERN CODE OF BUSINESS
8797-294123-0042 THE WESTERN ETHICS OF BUSINESS THAN HAS THE JAPANESE HE HAS LEARNED AS A MATTER OF COURSE TO KEEP HIS WORD OR HIS BOND AS YET THE JAPANESE BUSINESS MAN HAS FAILED TO UNDERSTAND THIS WHEN HE HAS SIGNED A TIME CONTRACT
8797-294123-0043 AND WHEN CHANGING CONDITIONS CAUSE HIM TO LOSE BY IT THE JAPANESE MERCHANT CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY HE SHOULD LIVE UP TO HIS CONTRACT IT IS BEYOND HIS COMPREHENSION AND REPULSIVE TO HIS COMMON SENSE THAT HE SHOULD LIVE UP TO HIS CONTRACT AND THEREBY LOSE MONEY
8797-294123-0044 HE FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT THE CHANGING CONDITIONS THEMSELVES ABSOLVE HIM AND IN SO FAR ADAPTABLE AS HE HAS SHOWN HIMSELF TO BE IN OTHER RESPECTS
8797-294123-0045 HERE WE HAVE THE CHINESE FOUR HUNDRED MILLIONS OF HIM OCCUPYING A VAST LAND OF IMMENSE NATURAL RESOURCES RESOURCES OF A TWENTIETH CENTURY AGE OF A MACHINE AGE
8797-294123-0046 RESOURCES OF COAL AND IRON WHICH ARE THE BACKBONE OF COMMERCIAL CIVILIZATION
8797-294123-0047 TRULY WOULD HE OF HIMSELF CONSTITUTE THE MUCH HERALDED YELLOW PERIL WERE IT NOT FOR HIS PRESENT MANAGEMENT THIS MANAGEMENT HIS GOVERNMENT IS SET CRYSTALLIZED IT IS WHAT BINDS HIM DOWN TO BUILDING AS HIS FATHERS BUILT
8797-294123-0048 THE GOVERNING CLASS ENTRENCHED BY THE PRECEDENT AND POWER OF CENTURIES AND BY THE STAMP IT HAS PUT UPON HIS MIND WILL NEVER FREE HIM IT WOULD BE THE SUICIDE OF THE GOVERNING CLASS AND THE GOVERNING CLASS KNOWS IT
8797-294123-0049 COMES NOW THE JAPANESE ON THE STREETS OF ANTUNG OF FENG WANG CHANG OR OF ANY OTHER MANCHURIAN CITY THE FOLLOWING IS A FAMILIAR SCENE
8797-294123-0050 ON ONE SIDE SQUATS A CHINESE CIVILIAN ON HIS HAMS ON THE OTHER SIDE SQUATS A JAPANESE SOLDIER
8797-294123-0051 THE OTHER NODS UNDERSTANDING SWEEPS THE DUST SLATE LEVEL WITH HIS HAND AND WITH HIS FOREFINGER INSCRIBES SIMILAR CHARACTERS THEY ARE TALKING THEY CANNOT SPEAK TO EACH OTHER BUT THEY CAN WRITE
8797-294123-0052 LONG AGO ONE BORROWED THE OTHER'S WRITTEN LANGUAGE AND LONG BEFORE THAT UNTOLD GENERATIONS AGO THEY DIVERGED FROM A COMMON ROOT THE ANCIENT MONGOL STOCK THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES
8797-294123-0053 DIFFERENTIATIONS BROUGHT ABOUT BY DIVERSE CONDITIONS AND INFUSIONS OF OTHER BLOOD BUT DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THEIR BEING TWISTED INTO THE FIBRES OF THEM IS A HERITAGE IN COMMON A SAMENESS IN KIND WHICH TIME HAS NOT OBLITERATED
8797-294123-0054 THE INFUSION OF OTHER BLOOD MALAY PERHAPS HAS MADE THE JAPANESE A RACE OF MASTERY AND POWER A FIGHTING RACE THROUGH ALL ITS HISTORY A RACE WHICH HAS ALWAYS DESPISED COMMERCE AND EXALTED FIGHTING TO DAY
8797-294123-0055 EQUIPPED WITH THE FINEST MACHINES AND SYSTEMS OF DESTRUCTION THE CAUCASIAN MIND HAS DEVISED HANDLING MACHINES AND SYSTEMS WITH REMARKABLE AND DEADLY ACCURACY THIS REJUVENESCENT JAPANESE RACE HAS EMBARKED ON A COURSE OF CONQUEST THE GOAL OF WHICH NO MAN KNOWS
8797-294123-0056 THE HEAD MEN OF JAPAN ARE DREAMING AMBITIOUSLY AND THE PEOPLE ARE DREAMING BLINDLY A NAPOLEONIC DREAM AND TO THIS DREAM THE JAPANESE CLINGS AND WILL CLING WITH BULL DOG TENACITY THE SOLDIER SHOUTING NIPPON BANZAI
8797-294123-0057 HER SOLE SUPPORT MAY GO TO THE FRONT ARE BOTH EXPRESSING THE UNANIMITY OF THE DREAM THE LATE DISTURBANCE IN THE FAR EAST MARKED THE CLASHING OF THE DREAMS FOR THE SLAV TOO IS DREAMING GREATLY
8797-294123-0058 GRANTING THAT THE JAPANESE CAN HURL BACK THE SLAV AND THAT THE TWO GREAT BRANCHES OF THE ANGLO SAXON RACE DO NOT DESPOIL HIM OF HIS SPOILS THE JAPANESE DREAM TAKES ON SUBSTANTIALITY
8797-294123-0059 BUT GIVEN POOR EMPTY KOREA FOR A BREEDING COLONY AND MANCHURIA FOR A GRANARY AND AT ONCE THE JAPANESE BEGINS TO INCREASE BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS EVEN SO HE WOULD NOT OF HIMSELF CONSTITUTE A BROWN PERIL
8797-294123-0060 HE HAS NOT THE TIME IN WHICH TO GROW AND REALIZE THE DREAM HE IS ONLY FORTY FIVE MILLIONS AND SO FAST DOES THE ECONOMIC EXPLOITATION OF THE PLANET HURRY ON THE PLANET'S PARTITION AMONGST THE WESTERN PEOPLES THAT BEFORE HE COULD ATTAIN THE STATURE REQUISITE TO MENACE
8797-294123-0061 HE WOULD SEE THE WESTERN GIANTS IN POSSESSION OF THE VERY STUFF OF HIS DREAM THE MENACE TO THE WESTERN WORLD LIES NOT IN THE LITTLE BROWN MAN BUT IN THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLIONS OF YELLOW MEN SHOULD THE LITTLE BROWN MAN UNDERTAKE THEIR MANAGEMENT
8797-294123-0062 THE CHINESE IS NOT DEAD TO NEW IDEAS HE IS AN EFFICIENT WORKER MAKES A GOOD SOLDIER AND IS WEALTHY IN THE ESSENTIAL MATERIALS OF A MACHINE AGE UNDER A CAPABLE MANAGEMENT HE WILL GO FAR
8797-294123-0063 THE JAPANESE IS PREPARED AND FIT TO UNDERTAKE THIS MANAGEMENT NOT ONLY HAS HE PROVED HIMSELF AN APT IMITATOR OF WESTERN MATERIAL PROGRESS A STURDY WORKER AND A CAPABLE ORGANIZER BUT HE IS FAR MORE FIT TO MANAGE THE CHINESE THAN ARE WE
8797-294123-0064 THE BAFFLING ENIGMA OF THE CHINESE CHARACTER IS NO BAFFLING ENIGMA TO HIM HE UNDERSTANDS AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES NOR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR MENTAL PROCESSES ARE LARGELY THE SAME
8797-294123-0065 HE THINKS WITH THE SAME THOUGHT SYMBOLS AS DOES THE CHINESE AND HE THINKS IN THE SAME PECULIAR GROOVES HE GOES ON WHERE WE ARE BALKED BY THE OBSTACLES OF INCOMPREHENSION HE TAKES THE TURNING WHICH WE CANNOT PERCEIVE
8797-294123-0066 TWISTS AROUND THE OBSTACLE AND PRESTO IS OUT OF SIGHT IN THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE CHINESE MIND WHERE WE CANNOT FOLLOW THE CHINESE HAS BEEN CALLED THE TYPE OF PERMANENCE AND WELL HE HAS MERITED IT DOZING AS HE HAS THROUGH THE AGES
8797-294123-0067 AND AS TRULY WAS THE JAPANESE THE TYPE OF PERMANENCE UP TO A GENERATION AGO
8797-294123-0068 THE IDEAS OF THE WEST WERE THE LEAVEN WHICH QUICKENED THE JAPANESE AND THE IDEAS OF THE WEST TRANSMITTED BY THE JAPANESE MIND INTO IDEAS JAPANESE MAY WELL MAKE THE LEAVEN POWERFUL ENOUGH TO QUICKEN THE CHINESE
8797-294123-0069 WE HAVE HAD AFRICA FOR THE AFRIKANDER AND AT NO DISTANT DAY WE SHALL HEAR ASIA FOR THE ASIATIC FOUR HUNDRED MILLION INDEFATIGABLE WORKERS DEFT INTELLIGENT AND UNAFRAID TO DIE AROUSED AND REJUVENESCENT
8797-294123-0070 MANAGED AND GUIDED BY FORTY FIVE MILLION ADDITIONAL HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE SPLENDID FIGHTING ANIMALS SCIENTIFIC AND MODERN CONSTITUTE THAT MENACE TO THE WESTERN WORLD WHICH HAS BEEN WELL NAMED THE YELLOW PERIL
8797-294123-0071 THE POSSIBILITY OF RACE ADVENTURE HAS NOT PASSED AWAY WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF OUR OWN THE SLAV IS JUST GIRDING HIMSELF UP TO BEGIN WHY MAY NOT THE YELLOW AND THE BROWN START OUT ON AN ADVENTURE AS TREMENDOUS AS OUR OWN AND MORE STRIKINGLY UNIQUE
8797-294123-0072 IT IS NOT THE NATURE OF LIFE TO BELIEVE ITSELF WEAK THERE IS SUCH A THING AS RACE EGOTISM AS WELL AS CREATURE EGOTISM AND A VERY GOOD THING IT IS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE WESTERN WORLD WILL NOT PERMIT THE RISE OF THE YELLOW PERIL
8797-294123-0073 IT ADVANCES THIS IDEA WITH PERSISTENCY AND DELIVERS ITSELF OF LONG ARGUMENTS SHOWING HOW AND WHY THIS MENACE WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO ARISE
8797-294123-0074 THE WESTERN WORLD IS WARNED IF NOT ARMED AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF IT IN THE SECOND PLACE THERE IS A WEAKNESS INHERENT IN THE BROWN MAN WHICH WILL BRING HIS ADVENTURE TO NAUGHT FROM THE WEST HE HAS BORROWED ALL OUR MATERIAL ACHIEVEMENT AND PASSED OUR ETHICAL ACHIEVEMENT BY
8797-294123-0075 OUR ENGINES OF PRODUCTION AND DESTRUCTION HE HAS MADE HIS WHAT WAS ONCE SOLELY OURS HE NOW DUPLICATES RIVALLING OUR MERCHANTS IN THE COMMERCE OF THE EAST THRASHING THE RUSSIAN ON SEA AND LAND A MARVELLOUS IMITATOR TRULY
8797-294123-0076 BUT IMITATING US ONLY IN THINGS MATERIAL THINGS SPIRITUAL CANNOT BE IMITATED THEY MUST BE FELT AND LIVED WOVEN INTO THE VERY FABRIC OF LIFE AND HERE THE JAPANESE FAILS
8797-294123-0077 IT REQUIRED NO REVOLUTION OF HIS NATURE TO LEARN TO CALCULATE THE RANGE AND FIRE A FIELD GUN OR TO MARCH THE GOOSE STEP IT WAS A MERE MATTER OF TRAINING OUR MATERIAL ACHIEVEMENT IS THE PRODUCT OF OUR INTELLECT
8797-294123-0078 IT IS KNOWLEDGE AND KNOWLEDGE LIKE COIN IS INTERCHANGEABLE IT IS NOT WRAPPED UP IN THE HEREDITY OF THE NEW BORN CHILD BUT IS SOMETHING TO BE ACQUIRED AFTERWARD
8797-294123-0079 OUR SOUL STUFF IS NOT A COIN TO BE POCKETED BY THE FIRST CHANCE COMER THE JAPANESE CANNOT POCKET IT ANY MORE THAN HE CAN THRILL TO SHORT SAXON WORDS OR WE CAN THRILL TO CHINESE HIEROGLYPHICS THE LEOPARD CANNOT CHANGE ITS SPOTS NOR CAN THE JAPANESE
8797-294123-0080 NOR CAN WE WE ARE THUMBED BY THE AGES INTO WHAT WE ARE AND BY NO CONSCIOUS INWARD EFFORT CAN WE IN A DAY RETHUMB OURSELVES NOR CAN THE JAPANESE IN A DAY OR A GENERATION RETHUMB HIMSELF IN OUR IMAGE
8797-294123-0081 BACK OF OUR OWN GREAT RACE ADVENTURE BACK OF OUR ROBBERIES BY SEA AND LAND OUR LUSTS AND VIOLENCES AND ALL THE EVIL THINGS WE HAVE DONE THERE IS A CERTAIN INTEGRITY A STERNNESS OF CONSCIENCE A MELANCHOLY RESPONSIBILITY OF LIFE
8797-294123-0082 A SYMPATHY AND COMRADESHIP AND WARM HUMAN FEEL WHICH IS OURS INDUBITABLY OURS AND WHICH WE CANNOT TEACH TO THE ORIENTAL AS WE WOULD TEACH LOGARITHMS OR THE TRAJECTORY OF PROJECTILES
8797-294123-0083 THAT WE HAVE GROPED FOR THE WAY OF RIGHT CONDUCT AND AGONIZED OVER THE SOUL BETOKENS OUR SPIRITUAL ENDOWMENT THOUGH WE HAVE STRAYED OFTEN AND FAR FROM RIGHTEOUSNESS THE VOICES OF THE SEERS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RAISED
8797-294123-0084 AND WE HAVE HARKED BACK TO THE BIDDING OF CONSCIENCE THE COLOSSAL FACT OF OUR HISTORY IS THAT WE HAVE MADE THE RELIGION OF JESUS CHRIST OUR RELIGION NO MATTER HOW DARK IN ERROR AND DEED OURS HAS BEEN A HISTORY OF SPIRITUAL STRUGGLE AND ENDEAVOUR
8797-294123-0085 WE ARE PRE EMINENTLY A RELIGIOUS RACE WHICH IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT WE ARE A RIGHT SEEKING RACE
8797-294123-0086 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEY HAVE NO SOUL WAS HER ANSWER THIS MUST NOT BE TAKEN TO MEAN THAT THE JAPANESE IS WITHOUT SOUL BUT IT SERVES TO ILLUSTRATE THE ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR SOULS AND THIS WOMAN'S SOUL
8797-294123-0087 THERE WAS NO FEEL NO SPEECH NO RECOGNITION THIS WESTERN SOUL DID NOT DREAM THAT THE EASTERN SOUL EXISTED IT WAS SO DIFFERENT SO TOTALLY DIFFERENT RELIGION AS A BATTLE FOR THE RIGHT IN OUR SENSE OF RIGHT
8797-294123-0088 AS A YEARNING AND A STRIFE FOR SPIRITUAL GOOD AND PURITY IS UNKNOWN TO THE JAPANESE MEASURED BY WHAT RELIGION MEANS TO US THE JAPANESE IS A RACE WITHOUT RELIGION YET IT HAS A RELIGION
8797-294123-0089 AS ONE JAPANESE HAS WRITTEN OUR REFLECTION BROUGHT INTO PROMINENCE NOT SO MUCH THE MORAL AS THE NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO US THE COUNTRY IS MORE THAN LAND AND SOIL FROM WHICH TO MINE GOLD OR REAP GRAIN
8797-294123-0090 IT IS THE SACRED ABODE OF THE GODS THE SPIRIT OF OUR FOREFATHERS TO US THE EMPEROR IS MORE THAN THE ARCH CONSTABLE OF A REICHSSTAAT OR EVEN THE PATRON OF A KULTURSTAAT HE IS THE BODILY REPRESENTATIVE OF HEAVEN ON EARTH
8797-294123-0091 BLENDING IN HIS PERSON ITS POWER AND ITS MERCY THE RELIGION OF JAPAN IS PRACTICALLY A WORSHIP OF THE STATE ITSELF PATRIOTISM IS THE EXPRESSION OF THIS WORSHIP THE JAPANESE MIND DOES NOT SPLIT HAIRS AS TO WHETHER THE EMPEROR IS HEAVEN INCARNATE OR THE STATE INCARNATE
8797-294123-0092 SO FAR AS THE JAPANESE ARE CONCERNED THE EMPEROR LIVES IS HIMSELF DEITY THE EMPEROR IS THE OBJECT TO LIVE FOR AND TO DIE FOR THE JAPANESE IS NOT AN INDIVIDUALIST
8797-294123-0093 HE HAS DEVELOPED NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS INSTEAD OF MORAL CONSCIOUSNESS HE IS NOT INTERESTED IN HIS OWN MORAL WELFARE EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS IT IS THE WELFARE OF THE STATE THE HONOUR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PER SE DOES NOT EXIST
8797-294123-0094 ONLY EXISTS THE HONOUR OF THE STATE WHICH IS HIS HONOUR HE DOES NOT LOOK UPON HIMSELF AS A FREE AGENT WORKING OUT HIS OWN PERSONAL SALVATION SPIRITUAL AGONIZING IS UNKNOWN TO HIM HE HAS A SENSE OF CALM TRUST IN FATE
8797-294123-0095 A QUIET SUBMISSION TO THE INEVITABLE A STOIC COMPOSURE IN SIGHT OF DANGER OR CALAMITY A DISDAIN OF LIFE AND FRIENDLINESS WITH DEATH HE RELATES HIMSELF TO THE STATE AS AMONGST BEES THE WORKER IS RELATED TO THE HIVE HIMSELF NOTHING
8797-294123-0096 THE STATE EVERYTHING HIS REASONS FOR EXISTENCE THE EXALTATION AND GLORIFICATION OF THE STATE THE MOST ADMIRED QUALITY TO DAY OF THE JAPANESE IS HIS PATRIOTISM
8797-294123-0097 THE WESTERN WORLD IS IN RHAPSODIES OVER IT UNWITTINGLY MEASURING THE JAPANESE PATRIOTISM BY ITS OWN CONCEPTIONS OF PATRIOTISM FOR GOD MY COUNTRY AND THE CZAR CRIES THE RUSSIAN PATRIOT
8797-294123-0098 BUT IN THE JAPANESE MIND THERE IS NO DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE THREE THE EMPEROR IS THE EMPEROR AND GOD AND COUNTRY AS WELL THE PATRIOTISM OF THE JAPANESE IS BLIND AND UNSWERVING LOYALTY TO WHAT IS PRACTICALLY AN ABSOLUTISM
8797-294123-0099 THE EMPEROR CAN DO NO WRONG NOR CAN THE FIVE AMBITIOUS GREAT MEN WHO HAVE HIS EAR AND CONTROL THE DESTINY OF JAPAN NO GREAT RACE ADVENTURE CAN GO FAR NOR ENDURE LONG WHICH HAS NO DEEPER FOUNDATION THAN MATERIAL SUCCESS
8797-294123-0100 NO HIGHER PROMPTING THAN CONQUEST FOR CONQUEST'S SAKE AND MERE RACE GLORIFICATION TO GO FAR AND TO ENDURE IT MUST HAVE BEHIND IT AN ETHICAL IMPULSE A SINCERELY CONCEIVED RIGHTEOUSNESS
8797-294123-0101 BUT IT MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE ABOVE POSTULATE IS ITSELF A PRODUCT OF WESTERN RACE EGOTISM URGED BY OUR BELIEF IN OUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS AND FOSTERED BY A FAITH IN OURSELVES WHICH MAY BE AS ERRONEOUS AS ARE MOST FOND RACE FANCIES
8797-294123-0102 SO BE IT THE WORLD IS WHIRLING FASTER TO DAY THAN EVER BEFORE IT HAS GAINED IMPETUS AFFAIRS RUSH TO CONCLUSION THE FAR EAST IS THE POINT OF CONTACT OF THE ADVENTURING WESTERN PEOPLE AS WELL AS OF THE ASIATIC
8797-294123-0103 WE SHALL NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR OUR CHILDREN'S TIME NOR OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN WE SHALL OURSELVES SEE AND LARGELY DETERMINE THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW AND THE BROWN FENG WANG CHENG MANCHURIA
8838-298545-0000 HE SAT IN SILENCE WITH HIS FINE SHOULDERS BOWED AND HIS HEAD UPON HIS HANDS OUTSIDE THROUGH THE GRIMY SURGERY WINDOW OVER A FOREGROUND OF BLACKENED BRICK AND SLATE A LINE OF ENORMOUS CHIMNEYS LIKE CYCLOPEAN PILLARS
8838-298545-0001 UPHELD THE LOWERING DUN COLOURED CLOUD BANK FOR SIX DAYS IN THE WEEK THEY SPOUTED SMOKE BUT TO DAY THE FURNACE FIRES WERE BANKED FOR IT WAS SUNDAY SORDID AND POLLUTING GLOOM HUNG OVER A DISTRICT BLIGHTED AND BLASTED BY THE GREED OF MAN
8838-298545-0002 HE SHOULD BE BACK AGAIN AT THE UNIVERSITY COMPLETING THE LAST YEAR WHICH WOULD GIVE HIM HIS MEDICAL DEGREE BUT ALAS HE HAD NOT THE MONEY WITH WHICH TO PAY HIS CLASS FEES NOR COULD HE IMAGINE HOW HE COULD PROCURE IT
8838-298545-0003 HE WAS ROUSED FROM HIS BLACK MEDITATION BY THE ENTRANCE OF DOCTOR OLDACRE HIMSELF A LARGE CLEAN SHAVEN RESPECTABLE MAN WITH A PRIM MANNER AND AN AUSTERE FACE HE HAD PROSPERED EXCEEDINGLY BY THE SUPPORT OF THE LOCAL CHURCH INTEREST
8838-298545-0004 AND THE RULE OF HIS LIFE WAS NEVER BY WORD OR ACTION TO RUN A RISK OF OFFENDING THE SENTIMENT WHICH HAD MADE HIM HIS STANDARD OF RESPECTABILITY AND OF DIGNITY WAS EXCEEDINGLY HIGH AND HE EXPECTED THE SAME FROM HIS ASSISTANTS
8838-298545-0005 HIS APPEARANCE AND WORDS WERE ALWAYS VAGUELY BENEVOLENT A SUDDEN IMPULSE CAME OVER THE DESPONDENT STUDENT HE WOULD TEST THE REALITY OF THIS PHILANTHROPY I BEG YOUR PARDON DOCTOR OLDACRE SAID HE RISING FROM HIS CHAIR
8838-298545-0006 I HAVE A GREAT FAVOUR TO ASK OF YOU THE DOCTOR'S APPEARANCE WAS NOT ENCOURAGING HIS MOUTH SUDDENLY TIGHTENED AND HIS EYES FELL YES MISTER MONTGOMERY YOU ARE AWARE SIR THAT I NEED ONLY ONE MORE SESSION TO COMPLETE MY COURSE
8838-298545-0007 I AM AFRAID THAT MY DUTIES CALL ME ELSEWHERE MISTER MONTGOMERY ONE MOMENT SIR I HAD HOPED SIR THAT PERHAPS IF I SIGNED A PAPER PROMISING YOU INTEREST UPON YOUR MONEY YOU WOULD ADVANCE THIS SUM TO ME I WILL PAY YOU BACK SIR I REALLY WILL OR
8838-298545-0008 IF YOU LIKE I WILL WORK IT OFF AFTER I AM QUALIFIED THE DOCTOR'S LIPS HAD THINNED INTO A NARROW LINE HIS EYES WERE RAISED AGAIN AND SPARKLED INDIGNANTLY YOUR REQUEST IS UNREASONABLE MISTER MONTGOMERY
8838-298545-0009 CONSIDER SIR HOW MANY THOUSANDS OF MEDICAL STUDENTS THERE ARE IN THIS COUNTRY NO DOUBT THERE ARE MANY OF THEM WHO HAVE A DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THEIR FEES AM I TO PROVIDE FOR THEM ALL OR WHY SHOULD I MAKE AN EXCEPTION IN YOUR FAVOUR I AM GRIEVED AND DISAPPOINTED MISTER MONTGOMERY
8838-298545-0010 THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE PUT ME INTO THE PAINFUL POSITION OF HAVING TO REFUSE YOU HE TURNED UPON HIS HEEL AND WALKED WITH OFFENDED DIGNITY OUT OF THE SURGERY THE STUDENT SMILED BITTERLY AND TURNED TO HIS WORK OF MAKING UP THE MORNING PRESCRIPTIONS
8838-298545-0011 HE ONLY EXCELLED IN HIS STRENGTH AND WHERE WAS HE TO FIND A CUSTOMER FOR THAT BUT THE WAYS OF FATE ARE STRANGE AND HIS CUSTOMER WAS AT HAND LOOK Y'ERE SAID A VOICE AT THE DOOR MONTGOMERY LOOKED UP
8838-298545-0012 FOR THE VOICE WAS A LOUD AND RASPING ONE A YOUNG MAN STOOD AT THE ENTRANCE A STOCKY BULL NECKED YOUNG MINER IN TWEED SUNDAY CLOTHES AND AN AGGRESSIVE NECK TIE HE WAS A SINISTER LOOKING FIGURE WITH DARK INSOLENT EYES
8838-298545-0013 AND THE JAW AND THROAT OF A BULLDOG LOOK Y'ERE SAID HE AGAIN WHY HAST THOU NOT SENT T MEDICINE OOP AS THY MASTER ORDERED MONTGOMERY HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THE BRUTAL FRANKNESS OF THE NORTHERN WORKER AT FIRST IT HAD ENRAGED HIM
8838-298545-0014 BUT AFTER A TIME HE HAD GROWN CALLOUS TO IT AND ACCEPTED IT AS IT WAS MEANT BUT THIS WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT IT WAS INSOLENCE BRUTAL OVERBEARING INSOLENCE WITH PHYSICAL MENACE BEHIND IT WHAT NAME HE ASKED COLDLY
8838-298545-0015 THE PROVOCATION WAS SO GROSS THE INSULT SO UNPROVOKED THAT HE COULD HAVE NONE OF THOSE QUALMS WHICH TAKE THE EDGE OFF A MAN'S METTLE HE FINISHED SEALING THE BOTTLE UPON WHICH HE WAS OCCUPIED AND HE ADDRESSED IT AND PLACED IT CAREFULLY IN THE RACK
8838-298545-0016 LOOK HERE SAID HE TURNING ROUND TO THE MINER YOUR MEDICINE WILL BE MADE UP IN ITS TURN AND SENT DOWN TO YOU I DON'T ALLOW FOLK IN THE SURGERY WAIT OUTSIDE IN THE WAITING ROOM IF YOU WISH TO WAIT AT ALL YOONG MAN SAID THE MINER
8838-298545-0017 THE BLOWS WERE ALMOST SIMULTANEOUS A SAVAGE SWING WHICH WHISTLED PAST MONTGOMERY'S EAR AND A STRAIGHT DRIVE WHICH TOOK THE WORKMAN ON THE CHIN LUCK WAS WITH THE ASSISTANT THAT SINGLE WHIZZING UPPERCUT AND THE WAY IN WHICH IT WAS DELIVERED
8838-298545-0018 HAD ENOUGH ASKED THE ASSISTANT BREATHING FIERCELY THROUGH HIS NOSE BUT NO ANSWER CAME THE MAN WAS INSENSIBLE AND THEN THE DANGER OF HIS POSITION CAME UPON MONTGOMERY AND HE TURNED AS WHITE AS HIS ANTAGONIST
8838-298545-0019 A SUNDAY THE IMMACULATE DOCTOR OLDACRE WITH HIS PIOUS CONNECTION A SAVAGE BRAWL WITH A PATIENT HE WOULD IRRETRIEVABLY LOSE HIS SITUATION IF THE FACTS CAME OUT IT WAS NOT MUCH OF A SITUATION BUT HE COULD NOT GET ANOTHER WITHOUT A REFERENCE
8838-298545-0020 LOOSENED HIS COLLAR AND SQUEEZED THE SURGERY SPONGE OVER HIS FACE HE SAT UP AT LAST WITH A GASP AND A SCOWL DOMN THEE THOU'S SPOILT MY NECK TIE SAID HE MOPPING UP THE WATER FROM HIS BREAST

8838-298545-0023 SAID THE MAN AND LURCHED OUT AT THE DOOR THE ASSISTANT LOOKING AFTER HIM SAW HIM ROLLING WITH AN UNCERTAIN STEP DOWN THE STREET UNTIL A FRIEND MET HIM AND THEY WALKED ON ARM IN ARM THE MAN SEEMED IN HIS ROUGH NORTHERN FASHION TO BEAR NO GRUDGE
8838-298545-0024 YET ALL DAY HE WAS AWARE OF A SENSE OF VAGUE UNEASINESS WHICH SHARPENED INTO DISMAY WHEN LATE IN THE AFTERNOON HE WAS INFORMED THAT THREE GENTLEMEN HAD CALLED AND WERE WAITING FOR HIM IN THE SURGERY A CORONER'S INQUEST
8838-298545-0025 ABOVE ALL WHAT THEY COULD EXPECT FROM HIM WAS A MOST INEXPLICABLE PROBLEM THE FIRST WAS SORLEY WILSON THE SON OF THE OWNER OF THE NONPAREIL COALPIT HE WAS A YOUNG BLOOD OF TWENTY HEIR TO A FORTUNE A KEEN SPORTSMAN
8838-298545-0026 AND DOWN FOR THE EASTER VACATION FROM MAGDALENE COLLEGE HE SAT NOW UPON THE EDGE OF THE SURGERY TABLE LOOKING IN THOUGHTFUL SILENCE AT MONTGOMERY AND TWISTING THE ENDS OF HIS SMALL BLACK WAXED MOUSTACHE THE SECOND WAS PURVIS THE PUBLICAN
8838-298545-0027 AND HE ALSO LEANED FORWARD IN SILENCE FROM HIS CHAIR A FAT RED HAND UPON EITHER KNEE AND STARED CRITICALLY AT THE YOUNG ASSISTANT SO DID THE THIRD VISITOR FAWCETT THE HORSE BREAKER WHO LEANED BACK HIS LONG THIN LEGS WITH THEIR BOXCLOTH RIDING GAITERS
8838-298545-0028 NO IT'S OFF IT'S NOWT STAND OOP LAD LET'S SEE THEE STANDIN IT WAS THE PUBLICAN WHO SPOKE MONTGOMERY OBEYED HE WOULD LEARN ALL ABOUT IT NO DOUBT IF HE WERE PATIENT
8838-298545-0029 A HUNDRED AND THIRTY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY IF HE'S AN OUNCE WELL THE MASTER DOESN'T SCALE MUCH MORE THAN THAT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THAT WAS WHEN HE WAS HOG FAT AND LIVING HIGH WORK THE GREASE OUT OF HIM AND I LAY THERE'S NO GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM
8838-298545-0030 HAVE YOU BEEN WEIGHED LATELY MISTER MONTGOMERY IT WAS THE FIRST DIRECT QUESTION WHICH HAD BEEN ASKED HIM HE HAD STOOD IN THE MIDST OF THEM LIKE A HORSE AT A FAIR AND HE WAS JUST BEGINNING TO WONDER WHETHER HE WAS MORE ANGRY OR AMUSED I AM JUST ELEVEN STONE SAID HE
8838-298545-0031 BUT TRAININ FOR EVERYDAY WORK AIN'T THE SAME AS TRAININ WITH A TRAINER AND I DARE BET WITH ALL RESPEC TO YOUR OPINION MISTER WILSON THAT THERE'S HALF A STONE OF TALLOW ON HIM AT THIS MINUTE THE YOUNG CANTAB PUT HIS FINGERS ON THE ASSISTANT'S UPPER ARM
8838-298545-0032 THEN WITH HIS OTHER HAND ON HIS WRIST HE BENT THE FOREARM SHARPLY AND FELT THE BICEPS AS ROUND AND HARD AS A CRICKET BALL SPRING UP UNDER HIS FINGERS FEEL THAT SAID HE THE PUBLICAN AND HORSE BREAKER FELT IT WITH AN AIR OF REVERENCE
8838-298545-0033 GOOD LAD HE'LL DO YET CRIED PURVIS GENTLEMEN SAID MONTGOMERY I THINK THAT YOU WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE BOON VERY PATIENT WITH YOU

8838-298545-0036 SAID THE UNIVERSITY MAN IN A GENIAL VOICE WE'VE BEGUN AT THE WRONG END I KNOW BUT WE'LL SOON STRAIGHTEN IT OUT
8838-298545-0037 YOU REMEMBER THE MAN WHOM YOU KNOCKED OUT THIS MORNING HE IS BARTON THE FAMOUS TED BARTON I'M SURE SIR YOU MAY WELL BE PROUD TO HAVE OUTED HIM IN ONE ROUND SAID THE PUBLICAN WHY IT TOOK MORRIS THE TEN STONE SIX CHAMPION
8838-298545-0038 A DEAL MORE TROUBLE THAN THAT BEFORE HE PUT BARTON TO SLEEP YOU'VE DONE A FINE PERFORMANCE SIR AND HAPPEN YOU'LL DO A FINER IF YOU GIVE YOURSELF THE CHANCE I NEVER HEARD OF TED BARTON BEYOND SEEING THE NAME ON A MEDICINE LABEL SAID THE ASSISTANT WELL
8838-298545-0039 YOU MAY TAKE IT FROM ME THAT HE'S A SLAUGHTERER SAID THE HORSE BREAKER YOU'VE TAUGHT HIM A LESSON THAT HE NEEDED FOR IT WAS ALWAYS A WORD AND A BLOW WITH HIM AND THE WORD ALONE WAS WORTH FIVE SHILLIN IN A PUBLIC COURT HE WON'T BE SO READY NOW TO SHAKE HIS NIEF IN THE FACE OF EVERYONE HE MEETS
8838-298545-0040 HOWEVER THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE MONTGOMERY LOOKED AT THEM IN BEWILDERMENT FOR GOODNESS SAKE GENTLEMEN TELL ME WHAT IT IS YOU WANT ME TO DO HE CRIED WE WANT YOU TO FIGHT SILAS CRAGGS BETTER KNOWN AS THE MASTER OF CROXLEY
8838-298545-0041 BUT WHY BECAUSE TED BARTON WAS TO HAVE FOUGHT HIM NEXT SATURDAY HE WAS THE CHAMPION OF THE WILSON COAL PITS AND THE OTHER WAS THE MASTER OF THE IRON FOLK DOWN AT THE CROXLEY SMELTERS WE'D MATCHED OUR MAN FOR A PURSE OF A HUNDRED AGAINST THE MASTER
8838-298545-0042 BUT YOU'VE QUEERED OUR MAN AND HE CAN'T FACE SUCH A BATTLE WITH A TWO INCH CUT AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO BE DONE SIR
8838-298545-0043 IF YOU CAN LICK TED BARTON YOU MAY LICK THE MASTER OF CROXLEY BUT IF YOU DON'T WE'RE DONE FOR THERE'S NO ONE ELSE WHO IS IN THE SAME STREET WITH HIM IN THIS DISTRICT IT'S TWENTY ROUNDS TWO OUNCE GLOVES QUEENSBERRY RULES AND A DECISION ON POINTS IF YOU FIGHT TO THE FINISH
8838-298545-0044 FOR A MOMENT THE ABSURDITY OF THE THING DROVE EVERY OTHER THOUGHT OUT OF MONTGOMERY'S HEAD
8838-298545-0045 ALL HE WANTED TO COMPLETE HIS EDUCATION WAS LYING THERE READY TO HIS HAND IF ONLY THAT HAND WERE STRONG ENOUGH TO PICK IT UP HE HAD THOUGHT BITTERLY THAT MORNING THAT THERE WAS NO MARKET FOR HIS STRENGTH
8838-298545-0046 THAN HIS BRAINS IN A YEAR BUT A CHILL OF DOUBT CAME OVER HIM HOW CAN I FIGHT FOR THE COAL PITS SAID HE I AM NOT CONNECTED WITH THEM EH LAD BUT THOU ART CRIED OLD PURVIS WE'VE GOT IT DOWN IN WRITIN AND IT'S CLEAR ENOUGH
8838-298545-0047 IT WOULD BE A VERY SPORTING THING OF YOU MISTER MONTGOMERY IF YOU WOULD COME TO OUR HELP WHEN WE ARE IN SUCH A HOLE OF COURSE YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE TO TAKE THE HUNDRED POUNDS BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IN THE CASE OF YOUR WINNING WE COULD ARRANGE THAT IT SHOULD TAKE THE FORM OF A WATCH OR PIECE OF PLATE
8838-298545-0048 OR ANY OTHER SHAPE WHICH MIGHT SUGGEST ITSELF TO YOU YOU SEE YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR HAVING LOST OUR CHAMPION SO WE REALLY FEEL THAT WE HAVE A CLAIM UPON YOU GIVE ME A MOMENT GENTLEMEN IT IS VERY UNEXPECTED
8838-298545-0049 I AM AFRAID THE DOCTOR WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO MY GOING IN FACT I AM SURE THAT HE WOULD NOT BUT HE NEED NEVER KNOW NOT BEFORE THE FIGHT AT ANY RATE WE ARE NOT BOUND TO GIVE THE NAME OF OUR MAN SO LONG AS HE IS WITHIN THE WEIGHT LIMITS ON THE DAY OF THE FIGHT THAT IS ALL THAT CONCERNS ANYONE
8838-298545-0050 THOU'LL RISE IN ONE DAY FROM BEING JUST A COMMON DOCTOR TO THE BEST KNOWN MON TWIXT HERE AND BRADFORD THOU ART A WITHERIN TYKE THOU ART AND NO MISTAKE AND IF THOU BEAT THE MASTER OF CROXLEY THOU'LL FIND ALL THE BEER THOU WANT FOR THE REST OF THY LIFE WAITING FOR THEE AT THE FOUR SACKS
8838-298545-0051 IT IS THE MOST SPORTING THING I EVER HEARD OF IN MY LIFE SAID YOUNG WILSON BY GEORGE SIR IF YOU PULL IT OFF YOU'VE GOT THE CONSTITUENCY IN YOUR POCKET IF YOU CARE TO STAND YOU KNOW THE OUT HOUSE IN MY GARDEN NEXT THE ROAD EXACTLY
8838-298545-0052 THEN YOU'LL WANT A SPARRING PARTNER OGILVY HAS BEEN ACTING FOR BARTON BUT WE DON'T THINK THAT HE IS CLASS ENOUGH BARTON BEARS YOU NO GRUDGE HE'S A GOOD HEARTED FELLOW THOUGH CROSS GRAINED WITH STRANGERS HE LOOKED UPON YOU AS A STRANGER THIS MORNING BUT HE SAYS HE KNOWS YOU NOW
8838-298546-0000 IT WAS TRUE THAT HIS TEACHER WAS LONG PAST HIS PRIME SLOW UPON HIS FEET AND STIFF IN HIS JOINTS BUT EVEN SO HE WAS STILL A TOUGH ANTAGONIST BUT MONTGOMERY HAD FOUND AT LAST THAT HE COULD MORE THAN HOLD HIS OWN WITH HIM HE HAD WON THE UNIVERSITY MEDAL AND HIS TEACHER
8838-298546-0001 IN WHICH HE HAD THE WORST OF IT BUT HAD MADE THE PRIZE FIGHTER STRETCH HIMSELF TO THE UTTERMOST THERE WAS HIS WHOLE RECORD AND WAS IT ENOUGH TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO STAND UP TO THE MASTER OF CROXLEY HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE MASTER BEFORE
8838-298546-0002 BUT THEN HE HAD LOST TOUCH OF THE RING DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS OF HARD WORK AFTER ALL WHAT DID IT MATTER IF HE WON THERE WAS THE MONEY WHICH MEANT SO MUCH TO HIM IF HE LOST IT WOULD ONLY MEAN A THRASHING HE COULD TAKE PUNISHMENT WITHOUT FLINCHING OF THAT HE WAS CERTAIN
8838-298546-0003 MATCHED AGAINST A PUGILIST OVER AT CROXLEY I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE LAW DOES NOT STEP IN AND STOP SO DEGRADING AN EXHIBITION IT IS REALLY A PRIZE FIGHT A GLOVE FIGHT YOU SAID
8838-298546-0004 I AM INFORMED THAT A TWO OZ GLOVE IS AN EVASION BY WHICH THEY DODGE THE LAW AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THE POLICE TO INTERFERE
8838-298546-0005 TO THINK THAT SUCH SCENES CAN BE ENACTED WITHIN A FEW MILES OF OUR PEACEFUL HOME BUT YOU WILL REALISE MISTER MONTGOMERY THAT WHILE THERE ARE SUCH INFLUENCES FOR US TO COUNTERACT IT IS VERY NECESSARY THAT WE SHOULD LIVE UP TO OUR HIGHEST
8838-298546-0006 THE DOCTOR'S SERMON WOULD HAVE HAD MORE EFFECT IF THE ASSISTANT HAD NOT ONCE OR TWICE HAD OCCASION TO TEST HIS HIGHEST AND COME UPON IT AT UNEXPECTEDLY HUMBLE ELEVATIONS IT IS ALWAYS SO PARTICULARLY EASY TO
8838-298546-0007 COMPOUND FOR SINS WE'RE MOST INCLINED TO BY DAMNING THOSE WE HAVE NO MIND TO IN ANY CASE MONTGOMERY FELT THAT OF ALL THE MEN CONCERNED IN SUCH A FIGHT PROMOTERS BACKERS SPECTATORS IT IS THE ACTUAL FIGHTER
8838-298546-0008 WHO HOLDS THE STRONGEST AND MOST HONOURABLE POSITION HIS CONSCIENCE GAVE HIM NO CONCERN UPON THE SUBJECT ENDURANCE AND COURAGE ARE VIRTUES NOT VICES AND BRUTALITY IS AT LEAST BETTER THAN EFFEMINACY
8838-298546-0009 THE ASSISTANT STROLLED DOWN THERE AFTER TEA AND ASKED IN A CASUAL WAY WHETHER THE TOBACCONIST HAD EVER HEARD OF THE MASTER OF CROXLEY
8838-298546-0010 THE LITTLE MAN COULD HARDLY ARTICULATE IN HIS ASTONISHMENT WHY SIR HE'S THE FIRST MON O THE DISTRICT AN HIS NAME'S AS WELL KNOWN IN THE WEST RIDING AS THE WINNER O T DERBY BUT LOR SIR HERE HE STOPPED AND RUMMAGED AMONG A HEAP OF PAPERS
8838-298546-0011 AND SO THE CROXLEY HERALD HAS HIS LIFE AN RECORD AN HERE IT IS AN THOU CANST READ IT FOR THYSEL THE SHEET OF THE PAPER WHICH HE HELD UP WAS A LAKE OF PRINT AROUND AN ISLET OF ILLUSTRATION THE LATTER WAS A COARSE WOOD CUT OF A PUGILIST'S HEAD AND NECK
8838-298546-0012 SILAS CRAGGS AND BENEATH THE MASTER OF CROXLEY THOU'LL FIND ALL ABOUT HIM THERE SIR SAID THE TOBACCONIST HE'S A WITHERIN TYKE HE IS AND WE'RE PROUD TO HAVE HIM IN THE COUNTY IF HE HADN'T BROKE HIS LEG HE'D HAVE BEEN CHAMPION OF ENGLAND
8838-298546-0013 BROKE HIS LEG HAS HE YES AND IT SET BADLY THEY CA HIM OWD K BEHIND HIS BACK FOR THAT IS HOW HIS TWO LEGS LOOK BUT HIS ARMS WELL IF THEY WAS BOTH STROPPED TO A BENCH AS THE SAYIN IS
8838-298546-0014 I'LL TAKE THIS WITH ME SAID MONTGOMERY AND PUTTING THE PAPER INTO HIS POCKET HE RETURNED HOME IT WAS NOT A CHEERING RECORD WHICH HE READ THERE THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE CROXLEY MASTER WAS GIVEN IN FULL HIS MANY VICTORIES HIS FEW DEFEATS
8838-298546-0015 BORN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN SAID THE PROVINCIAL BIOGRAPHER SILAS CRAGGS BETTER KNOWN IN SPORTING CIRCLES AS THE MASTER OF CROXLEY IS NOW IN HIS FORTIETH YEAR HANG IT I'M ONLY TWENTY THREE
8838-298546-0016 AND WON THE PROUD TITLE WHICH HE STILL HOLDS AMBITIOUS OF A MORE THAN LOCAL FAME HE SECURED A PATRON AND FOUGHT HIS FIRST FIGHT AGAINST JACK BARTON OF BIRMINGHAM IN MAY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY AT THE OLD LOITERERS CLUB CRAGGS
8838-298546-0017 WHO FOUGHT AT TEN STONE TWO AT THE TIME HAD THE BETTER OF FIFTEEN RATTLING ROUNDS AND GAINED AN AWARD ON POINTS AGAINST THE MIDLANDER HAVING DISPOSED OF JAMES DUNN OF ROTHERHITHE CAMERON OF GLASGOW AND A YOUTH NAMED FERNIE
8838-298546-0018 IT WAS OWING TO THIS THAT HE WAS DEFEATED IN SEVEN ROUNDS BY WILLOX THE MAN WHOM HE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEATEN AND AFTERWARDS BY JAMES SHAW OF LONDON THOUGH THE LATTER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD FOUND THE TOUGHEST CUSTOMER OF HIS CAREER UNDISMAYED BY HIS REVERSES
8838-298546-0019 THE MASTER ADAPTED THE STYLE OF HIS FIGHTING TO HIS PHYSICAL DISABILITIES AND RESUMED HIS CAREER OF VICTORY DEFEATING NORTON THE BLACK HOBBY WILSON AND LEVI COHEN THE LATTER A HEAVY WEIGHT CONCEDING TWO STONE HE FOUGHT A DRAW WITH THE FAMOUS BILLY MC QUIRE
8838-298546-0020 WHO MAY WISH TO LEARN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BAR ROOM SCRAMBLE AND A SCIENTIFIC CONTEST THE LATEST OF THESE AMBITIOUS SOULS COMES FROM THE WILSON COAL PITS WHICH HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO PUT UP A STAKE OF ONE HUNDRED POUNDS AND BACK THEIR LOCAL CHAMPION
8838-298546-0021 THERE ARE VARIOUS RUMOURS AFLOAT AS TO WHO THEIR REPRESENTATIVE IS TO BE THE NAME OF TED BARTON BEING FREELY MENTIONED BUT THE BETTING WHICH IS SEVEN TO ONE ON THE MASTER AGAINST ANY UNTRIED MAN IS A FAIR REFLECTION OF THE FEELING OF THE COMMUNITY
8838-298546-0022 NO LIGHT MATTER THIS WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN NO BATTLE WITH A ROUGH AND TUMBLE FIGHTER WHO PRESUMED UPON A LOCAL REPUTATION THE MAN'S RECORD SHOWED THAT HE WAS FIRST CLASS OR NEARLY SO THERE WERE A FEW POINTS IN HIS FAVOUR AND HE MUST MAKE THE MOST OF THEM
8838-298546-0023 THERE WAS AGE TWENTY THREE AGAINST FORTY THERE WAS AN OLD RING PROVERB THAT YOUTH WILL BE SERVED BUT THE ANNALS OF THE RING OFFER A GREAT NUMBER OF EXCEPTIONS A HARD VETERAN FULL OF COOL VALOUR AND RING CRAFT
8838-298546-0024 COULD GIVE TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AND A BEATING TO MOST STRIPLINGS HE COULD NOT RELY TOO MUCH UPON HIS ADVANTAGE IN AGE BUT THEN THERE WAS THE LAMENESS THAT MUST SURELY COUNT FOR A GREAT DEAL AND LASTLY THERE WAS THE CHANCE THAT THE MASTER MIGHT UNDERRATE HIS OPPONENT
8838-298546-0025 THAT HE MIGHT BE REMISS IN HIS TRAINING AND REFUSE TO ABANDON HIS USUAL WAY OF LIFE IF HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD AN EASY TASK BEFORE HIM IN A MAN OF HIS AGE AND HABITS THIS SEEMED VERY POSSIBLE MONTGOMERY PRAYED THAT IT MIGHT BE SO
8838-298546-0026 MEANWHILE IF HIS OPPONENT WERE THE BEST MAN WHO EVER JUMPED THE ROPES INTO A RING HIS OWN DUTY WAS CLEAR HE MUST PREPARE HIMSELF CAREFULLY THROW AWAY NO CHANCE AND DO THE VERY BEST THAT HE COULD BUT HE KNEW ENOUGH TO APPRECIATE THE DIFFERENCE WHICH EXISTS IN BOXING AS IN EVERY SPORT
8838-298546-0027 BETWEEN THE AMATEUR AND THE PROFESSIONAL THE COOLNESS THE POWER OF HITTING ABOVE ALL THE CAPABILITY OF TAKING PUNISHMENT COUNT FOR SO MUCH THOSE SPECIALLY DEVELOPED GUTTA PERCHA LIKE ABDOMINAL MUSCLES OF THE HARDENED PUGILIST
8838-298546-0028 WILL TAKE WITHOUT FLINCHING A BLOW WHICH WOULD LEAVE ANOTHER MAN WRITHING ON THE GROUND SUCH THINGS ARE NOT TO BE ACQUIRED IN A WEEK BUT ALL THAT COULD BE DONE IN A WEEK SHOULD BE DONE THE MEDICAL ASSISTANT HAD A GOOD BASIS TO START FROM
8838-298546-0029 TALL ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING ON TWO LEGS AS THE OLD RING MEN USED TO SAY LITHE AND SPARE WITH THE ACTIVITY OF A PANTHER AND A STRENGTH WHICH HAD HARDLY YET EVER FOUND ITS LIMITATIONS HIS MUSCULAR DEVELOPMENT WAS FINELY HARD
8838-298546-0030 BUT AS THE VISITING WAS DONE ON FOOT AND CONSIDERABLE DISTANCES HAD TO BE TRAVERSED IT WAS A TRAINING IN ITSELF FOR THE REST HE PUNCHED THE SWINGING BALL AND WORKED WITH THE DUMB BELLS FOR AN HOUR EVERY MORNING AND EVENING AND BOXED TWICE A DAY WITH TED BARTON IN THE GYMNASIUM
8838-298546-0031 GAINING AS MUCH PROFIT AS COULD BE GOT FROM A RUSHING TWO HANDED SLOGGER BARTON WAS FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR HIS CLEVERNESS AND QUICKNESS BUT DOUBTFUL ABOUT HIS STRENGTH HARD HITTING WAS THE FEATURE OF HIS OWN STYLE AND HE EXACTED IT FROM OTHERS
8838-298546-0032 ALL THOT'S BETTER MON THOT'S FINE HE WOULD ADD AS HIS OPPONENT LIFTED HIM ACROSS THE ROOM ON THE END OF A RIGHT COUNTER THOT'S HOW I LIKES TO FEEL EM HAPPEN THOU'LT PULL THROUGH YET HE CHUCKLED WITH JOY WHEN MONTGOMERY KNOCKED HIM INTO A CORNER
8838-298546-0033 THESE CAUSELESS WHIMS AND FANCIES ARE VERY MUCH TO BE DEPRECATED MISTER MONTGOMERY CONSIDER HOW MANY THERE ARE TO WHOM THESE VERY POTATOES AND THIS VERY BEER WOULD BE MOST ACCEPTABLE NO DOUBT SIR BUT AT PRESENT I PREFER TO DO WITHOUT THEM
8838-298546-0034 I SHOULD DO A DOUBLE DAY'S WORK ON FRIDAY SO AS TO LEAVE EVERYTHING IN ORDER I SHOULD HOPE TO BE BACK IN THE EVENING I AM AFRAID I CANNOT SPARE YOU MISTER MONTGOMERY THIS WAS A FACER IF HE COULD NOT GET LEAVE HE WOULD GO WITHOUT IT
8838-298546-0035 YOU WILL REMEMBER DOCTOR OLDACRE THAT WHEN I CAME TO YOU IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT I SHOULD HAVE A CLEAR DAY EVERY MONTH I HAVE NEVER CLAIMED ONE BUT NOW THERE ARE REASONS WHY I WISH TO HAVE A HOLIDAY UPON SATURDAY DOCTOR OLDACRE GAVE IN WITH A VERY BAD GRACE
8838-298546-0036 OF COURSE IF YOU INSIST UPON YOUR FORMAL RIGHTS THERE IS NO MORE TO BE SAID MISTER MONTGOMERY THOUGH I FEEL THAT IT SHOWS A CERTAIN INDIFFERENCE TO MY COMFORT AND THE WELFARE OF THE PRACTICE DO YOU STILL INSIST YES SIR VERY GOOD HAVE YOUR WAY
8838-298546-0037 A QUIET RESOLUTION IN HIS VOICE AS HE CLAIMED HIS SATURDAY WHICH AROUSED HIS CURIOSITY I HAVE NO DESIRE TO INTERFERE UNDULY WITH YOUR AFFAIRS MISTER MONTGOMERY BUT WERE YOU THINKING OF HAVING A DAY IN LEEDS UPON SATURDAY NO SIR
8838-298546-0038 IN THE COUNTRY YES SIR YOU ARE VERY WISE YOU WILL FIND A QUIET DAY AMONG THE WILD FLOWERS A VERY VALUABLE RESTORATIVE HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF ANY PARTICULAR DIRECTION I AM GOING OVER CROXLEY WAY
8838-298546-0039 A VERY INTERESTING RELIC OF THE EARLY NORMAN ERA BY THE WAY THERE IS ONE OBJECTION WHICH I SEE TO YOUR GOING TO CROXLEY ON SATURDAY IT IS UPON THAT DATE AS I AM INFORMED THAT THAT RUFFIANLY GLOVE FIGHT TAKES PLACE
8838-298546-0040 YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF MOLESTED BY THE BLACKGUARDS WHOM IT WILL ATTRACT I WILL TAKE MY CHANCE OF THAT SIR SAID THE ASSISTANT ON THE FRIDAY NIGHT WHICH WAS THE LAST NIGHT BEFORE THE FIGHT
8838-298546-0041 HE'S SIMPLY RIPPING SAID THE UNDERGRADUATE
8838-298546-0042 THAT'S ONLY THREE PUND OFF IN A WEEK'S TRAININ SAID THE HORSE BREAKER HE SAID RIGHT WHEN HE SAID THAT HE WAS IN CONDITION WELL IT'S FINE STUFF ALL THERE IS OF IT BUT I'M NONE SO SURE AS THERE IS ENOUGH
8838-298546-0043 HE KEPT POKING HIS FINGER INTO MONTGOMERY AS IF HE WERE ONE OF HIS HORSES I HEAR THAT THE MASTER WILL SCALE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ODD AT THE RING SIDE BUT THERE'S SOME OF THAT WHICH HE'D LIKE WELL TO PULL OFF AND LEAVE BEHIND WI HIS SHIRT SAID PURVIS
8838-298546-0044 I HEAR THEY'VE HAD A RARE JOB TO GET HIM TO DROP HIS BEER AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THAT GREAT RED HEADED WENCH OF HIS
8838-298546-0045 SHE FAIR SCRATTED THE FACE OFF A POTMAN THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM A GALLON FROM T CHEQUERS THEY SAY THE HUSSY IS HIS SPARRIN PARTNER AS WELL AS HIS SWEETHEART AND THAT HIS POOR WIFE IS JUST BREAKIN HER HEART OVER IT HULLO YOUNG UN WHAT DO YOU WANT
8838-298546-0046 THE DOOR OF THE GYMNASIUM HAD OPENED AND A LAD ABOUT SIXTEEN GRIMY AND BLACK WITH SOOT AND IRON STEPPED INTO THE YELLOW GLARE OF THE OIL LAMP TED BARTON SEIZED HIM BY THE COLLAR
8838-298546-0047 SEE HERE THOU YOONG WHELP THIS IS PRIVATE AND WE WANT NOAN O THY SPYIN BUT I MAUN SPEAK TO MISTER WILSON THE YOUNG CANTAB STEPPED FORWARD WELL MY LAD WHAT IS IT

8838-298546-0053 I DO IT FOR LOVE SUGGESTED THE PUBLICAN FOR HATE SAID THE BOY AND DARTED OFF INTO THE DARKNESS SEEMS TO ME T RED HEADED WENCH MAY DO HIM MORE HARM THAN GOOD AFTER ALL REMARKED THE PUBLICAN
887-123289-0000 WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE RAFT WAS DASHED UPON THE ROCKS IS MORE THAN I CAN TELL I FELT MYSELF HURLED INTO THE WAVES AND IF I ESCAPED FROM DEATH AND IF MY BODY WAS NOT TORN OVER THE SHARP EDGES OF THE ROCKS
887-123289-0001 IT WAS BECAUSE THE POWERFUL ARM OF HANS CAME TO MY RESCUE THE BRAVE ICELANDER CARRIED ME OUT OF THE REACH OF THE WAVES OVER A BURNING SAND WHERE I FOUND MYSELF BY THE SIDE OF MY UNCLE
887-123289-0002 THEN HE RETURNED TO THE ROCKS AGAINST WHICH THE FURIOUS WAVES WERE BEATING TO SAVE WHAT HE COULD I WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK I WAS SHATTERED WITH FATIGUE AND EXCITEMENT
887-123289-0003 I WANTED A WHOLE HOUR TO RECOVER EVEN A LITTLE BUT A DELUGE OF RAIN WAS STILL FALLING THOUGH WITH THAT VIOLENCE WHICH GENERALLY DENOTES THE NEAR CESSATION OF A STORM
887-123289-0004 THE NEXT DAY THE WEATHER WAS SPLENDID THE SKY AND THE SEA HAD SUNK INTO SUDDEN REPOSE EVERY TRACE OF THE AWFUL STORM HAD DISAPPEARED
887-123289-0005 THE EXHILARATING VOICE OF THE PROFESSOR FELL UPON MY EARS AS I AWOKE HE WAS OMINOUSLY CHEERFUL WELL MY BOY HE CRIED HAVE YOU SLEPT WELL
887-123289-0006 AND THAT I WAS ONLY JUST COMING DOWN TO BREAKFAST AND THAT I WAS TO BE MARRIED TO GRAEUBEN THAT DAY ALAS IF THE TEMPEST HAD BUT SENT THE RAFT A LITTLE MORE EAST WE SHOULD HAVE PASSED UNDER GERMANY UNDER MY BELOVED TOWN OF HAMBURG
887-123289-0007 UNDER THE VERY STREET WHERE DWELT ALL THAT I LOVED MOST IN THE WORLD THEN ONLY FORTY LEAGUES WOULD HAVE SEPARATED US BUT THEY WERE FORTY LEAGUES PERPENDICULAR OF SOLID GRANITE WALL AND IN REALITY WE WERE A THOUSAND LEAGUES ASUNDER
887-123289-0008 ALL THESE PAINFUL REFLECTIONS RAPIDLY CROSSED MY MIND BEFORE I COULD ANSWER MY UNCLE'S QUESTION WELL NOW HE REPEATED WON'T YOU TELL ME HOW YOU HAVE SLEPT OH VERY WELL I SAID
887-123289-0009 I AM ONLY A LITTLE KNOCKED UP BUT I SHALL SOON BE BETTER OH SAYS MY UNCLE THAT'S NOTHING TO SIGNIFY YOU ARE ONLY A LITTLE BIT TIRED BUT YOU UNCLE YOU SEEM IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS THIS MORNING
887-123289-0010 BUT MY DEAR UNCLE DO LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION OF COURSE AXEL HOW ABOUT RETURNING RETURNING WHY YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE RETURN BEFORE THE ARRIVAL NO
887-123289-0011 I ONLY WANT TO KNOW HOW THAT IS TO BE MANAGED IN THE SIMPLEST WAY POSSIBLE WHEN WE HAVE REACHED THE CENTRE OF THE GLOBE EITHER WE SHALL FIND SOME NEW WAY TO GET BACK OR WE SHALL COME BACK LIKE DECENT FOLKS THE WAY WE CAME
887-123289-0012 I FEEL PLEASED AT THE THOUGHT THAT IT IS SURE NOT TO BE SHUT AGAINST US BUT THEN WE SHALL HAVE TO REFIT THE RAFT OF COURSE THEN AS TO PROVISIONS HAVE WE ENOUGH TO LAST
887-123289-0013 YES TO BE SURE WE HAVE HANS IS A CLEVER FELLOW AND I AM SURE HE MUST HAVE SAVED A LARGE PART OF OUR CARGO BUT STILL LET US GO AND MAKE SURE
887-123289-0014 WE LEFT THIS GROTTO WHICH LAY OPEN TO EVERY WIND AT THE SAME TIME I CHERISHED A TREMBLING HOPE WHICH WAS A FEAR AS WELL IT SEEMED TO ME IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE TERRIBLE WRECK OF THE RAFT SHOULD NOT HAVE DESTROYED EVERYTHING ON BOARD
887-123289-0015 ON MY ARRIVAL ON THE SHORE I FOUND HANS SURROUNDED BY AN ASSEMBLAGE OF ARTICLES ALL ARRANGED IN GOOD ORDER MY UNCLE SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM WITH A LIVELY GRATITUDE THIS MAN WITH ALMOST SUPERHUMAN DEVOTION
887-123289-0016 AND HAD SAVED THE MOST PRECIOUS OF THE ARTICLES AT THE RISK OF HIS LIFE NOT THAT WE HAD SUFFERED NO LOSSES FOR INSTANCE OUR FIREARMS BUT WE MIGHT DO WITHOUT THEM OUR STOCK OF POWDER HAD REMAINED UNINJURED
887-123289-0017 AFTER HAVING RISKED BLOWING UP DURING THE STORM WELL CRIED THE PROFESSOR AS WE HAVE NO GUNS WE CANNOT HUNT THAT'S ALL YES BUT HOW ABOUT THE INSTRUMENTS HERE IS THE ANEROID THE MOST USEFUL OF ALL
887-123289-0018 AND FOR WHICH I WOULD HAVE GIVEN ALL THE OTHERS BY MEANS OF IT I CAN CALCULATE THE DEPTH AND KNOW WHEN WE HAVE REACHED THE CENTRE WITHOUT IT
887-123289-0019 SUCH HIGH SPIRITS AS THESE WERE RATHER TOO STRONG BUT WHERE IS THE COMPASS I ASKED HERE IT IS UPON THIS ROCK IN PERFECT CONDITION AS WELL AS THE THERMOMETERS AND THE CHRONOMETER THE HUNTER IS A SPLENDID FELLOW
887-123289-0020 THERE WAS NO DENYING IT WE HAD ALL OUR INSTRUMENTS AS FOR TOOLS AND APPLIANCES THERE THEY ALL LAY ON THE GROUND LADDERS ROPES PICKS SPADES ET CETERA STILL THERE WAS THE QUESTION OF PROVISIONS TO BE SETTLED AND I ASKED
887-123289-0021 HOW ARE WE OFF FOR PROVISIONS THE BOXES CONTAINING THESE WERE IN A LINE UPON THE SHORE IN A PERFECT STATE OF PRESERVATION FOR THE MOST PART THE SEA HAD SPARED THEM AND WHAT WITH BISCUITS SALT MEAT SPIRITS AND SALT FISH
887-123289-0022 FOUR MONTHS CRIED THE PROFESSOR WE HAVE TIME TO GO AND TO RETURN
887-123289-0023 I OUGHT BY THIS TIME TO HAVE BEEN QUITE ACCUSTOMED TO MY UNCLE'S WAYS YET THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING FRESH ABOUT HIM TO ASTONISH ME NOW SAID HE
887-123289-0024 THEREFORE WE SHALL HAVE NO REASON TO FEAR ANYTHING FROM THIRST AS FOR THE RAFT I WILL RECOMMEND HANS TO DO HIS BEST TO REPAIR IT ALTHOUGH I DON'T EXPECT IT WILL BE OF ANY FURTHER USE TO US HOW SO I CRIED AN IDEA OF MY OWN MY LAD
887-123289-0025 I DON'T THINK WE SHALL COME OUT BY THE WAY THAT WE WENT IN I STARED AT THE PROFESSOR WITH A GOOD DEAL OF MISTRUST I ASKED WAS HE NOT TOUCHED IN THE BRAIN AND YET THERE WAS METHOD IN HIS MADNESS AND NOW LET US GO TO BREAKFAST SAID HE
887-123289-0026 I FOLLOWED HIM TO A HEADLAND AFTER HE HAD GIVEN HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO THE HUNTER THERE PRESERVED MEAT BISCUIT AND TEA MADE US AN EXCELLENT MEAL ONE OF THE BEST I EVER REMEMBER HUNGER THE FRESH AIR THE CALM QUIET WEATHER
887-123289-0027 AFTER THE COMMOTIONS WE HAD GONE THROUGH ALL CONTRIBUTED TO GIVE ME A GOOD APPETITE WHILST BREAKFASTING I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT TO MY UNCLE THE QUESTION WHERE WE WERE NOW THAT SEEMS TO ME I SAID RATHER DIFFICULT TO MAKE OUT
887-123289-0028 YES IT IS DIFFICULT HE SAID TO CALCULATE EXACTLY PERHAPS EVEN IMPOSSIBLE SINCE DURING THESE THREE STORMY DAYS I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO KEEP ANY ACCOUNT OF THE RATE OR DIRECTION OF THE RAFT BUT STILL WE MAY GET AN APPROXIMATION
887-123289-0029 THE LAST OBSERVATION I REMARKED WAS MADE ON THE ISLAND WHEN THE GEYSER WAS YOU MEAN AXEL ISLAND DON'T DECLINE THE HONOUR OF HAVING GIVEN YOUR NAME TO THE FIRST ISLAND EVER DISCOVERED IN THE CENTRAL PARTS OF THE GLOBE WELL SAID I
887-123289-0030 LET IT BE AXEL ISLAND THEN WE HAD CLEARED TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY LEAGUES OF SEA AND WE WERE SIX HUNDRED LEAGUES FROM ICELAND VERY WELL ANSWERED MY UNCLE LET US START FROM THAT POINT AND COUNT FOUR DAYS STORM
887-123289-0031 SURELY AXEL IT MAY VIE IN SIZE WITH THE MEDITERRANEAN ITSELF ESPECIALLY I REPLIED IF IT HAPPENS THAT WE HAVE ONLY CROSSED IT IN ITS NARROWEST PART AND IT IS A CURIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE I ADDED THAT IF MY COMPUTATIONS ARE RIGHT
887-123289-0032 THAT IS A GOOD LONG WAY MY FRIEND BUT WHETHER WE ARE UNDER TURKEY OR THE ATLANTIC DEPENDS VERY MUCH UPON THE QUESTION
887-123289-0033 PERHAPS WE HAVE DEVIATED NO I THINK NOT
887-123289-0034 WELL REPLIED MY UNCLE WE MAY EASILY ASCERTAIN THIS BY CONSULTING THE COMPASS LET US GO AND SEE WHAT IT SAYS THE PROFESSOR MOVED TOWARDS THE ROCK UPON WHICH HANS HAD LAID DOWN THE INSTRUMENTS
887-123289-0035 HE WAS GAY AND FULL OF SPIRITS HE RUBBED HIS HANDS HE STUDIED HIS ATTITUDES I FOLLOWED HIM CURIOUS TO KNOW IF I WAS RIGHT IN MY ESTIMATE AS SOON AS WE HAD ARRIVED AT THE ROCK MY UNCLE TOOK THE COMPASS LAID IT HORIZONTALLY
887-123289-0036 AND QUESTIONED THE NEEDLE WHICH AFTER A FEW OSCILLATIONS PRESENTLY ASSUMED A FIXED POSITION MY UNCLE LOOKED AND LOOKED AND LOOKED AGAIN HE RUBBED HIS EYES
887-123289-0037 AND THEN TURNED TO ME THUNDERSTRUCK WITH SOME UNEXPECTED DISCOVERY WHAT IS THE MATTER I ASKED
887-123289-0038 AN EXCLAMATION OF ASTONISHMENT BURST FROM ME THE NORTH POLE OF THE NEEDLE WAS TURNED TO WHAT WE SUPPOSED TO BE THE SOUTH IT POINTED TO THE SHORE INSTEAD OF TO THE OPEN SEA I SHOOK THE BOX EXAMINED IT AGAIN
887-123289-0039 IT WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION IN WHATEVER POSITION I PLACED THE BOX THE NEEDLE PERTINACIOUSLY RETURNED TO THIS UNEXPECTED QUARTER
887-123290-0000 WE HAD GONE BACKWARDS INSTEAD OF FORWARDS BUT MY UNCLE RAPIDLY RECOVERED HIMSELF AHA WILL FATE PLAY TRICKS UPON ME WILL THE ELEMENTS LAY PLOTS AGAINST ME
887-123290-0001 SHALL FIRE AIR AND WATER MAKE A COMBINED ATTACK AGAINST ME WELL THEY SHALL KNOW WHAT A DETERMINED MAN CAN DO I WILL NOT YIELD I WILL NOT STIR A SINGLE FOOT BACKWARDS AND IT WILL BE SEEN WHETHER MAN OR NATURE IS TO HAVE THE UPPER HAND
887-123290-0002 ERECT UPON THE ROCK ANGRY AND THREATENING OTTO LIEDENBROCK WAS A RATHER GROTESQUE FIERCE PARODY UPON THE FIERCE ACHILLES DEFYING THE LIGHTNING BUT I THOUGHT IT MY DUTY TO INTERPOSE AND ATTEMPT TO LAY SOME RESTRAINT UPON THIS UNMEASURED FANATICISM
887-123290-0003 JUST LISTEN TO ME I SAID FIRMLY AMBITION MUST HAVE A LIMIT SOMEWHERE WE CANNOT PERFORM IMPOSSIBILITIES WE ARE NOT AT ALL FIT FOR ANOTHER SEA VOYAGE WHO WOULD DREAM OF UNDERTAKING A VOYAGE OF FIVE HUNDRED LEAGUES UPON A HEAP OF ROTTEN PLANKS
887-123290-0004 WITH A BLANKET IN RAGS FOR A SAIL A STICK FOR A MAST AND FIERCE WINDS IN OUR TEETH WE CANNOT STEER WE SHALL BE BUFFETED BY THE TEMPESTS AND WE SHOULD BE FOOLS AND MADMEN TO ATTEMPT TO CROSS A SECOND TIME
887-123290-0005 I WAS ABLE TO DEVELOP THIS SERIES OF UNANSWERABLE REASONS FOR TEN MINUTES WITHOUT INTERRUPTION NOT THAT THE PROFESSOR WAS PAYING ANY RESPECTFUL ATTENTION TO HIS NEPHEW'S ARGUMENTS BUT BECAUSE HE WAS DEAF TO ALL MY ELOQUENCE
887-123290-0006 TO THE RAFT HE SHOUTED SUCH WAS HIS ONLY REPLY IT WAS NO USE FOR ME TO ENTREAT SUPPLICATE GET ANGRY OR DO ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WAY OF OPPOSITION
887-123290-0007 HANS WAS FINISHING THE REPAIRS OF THE RAFT ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THIS STRANGE BEING WAS GUESSING AT MY UNCLE'S INTENTIONS WITH A FEW MORE PIECES OF SURTURBRAND HE HAD REFITTED OUR VESSEL
887-123290-0008 A SAIL ALREADY HUNG FROM THE NEW MAST AND THE WIND WAS PLAYING IN ITS WAVING FOLDS THE PROFESSOR SAID A FEW WORDS TO THE GUIDE AND IMMEDIATELY HE PUT EVERYTHING ON BOARD AND ARRANGED EVERY NECESSARY FOR OUR DEPARTURE
887-123290-0009 THE AIR WAS CLEAR AND THE NORTH WEST WIND BLEW STEADILY WHAT COULD I DO COULD I STAND AGAINST THE TWO IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE IF HANS HAD BUT TAKEN MY SIDE BUT NO IT WAS NOT TO BE
887-123290-0010 THE ICELANDER SEEMED TO HAVE RENOUNCED ALL WILL OF HIS OWN AND MADE A VOW TO FORGET AND DENY HIMSELF I COULD GET NOTHING OUT OF A SERVANT SO FEUDALISED AS IT WERE TO HIS MASTER MY ONLY COURSE WAS TO PROCEED
887-123290-0011 I WAS THEREFORE GOING WITH AS MUCH RESIGNATION AS I COULD FIND TO RESUME MY ACCUSTOMED PLACE ON THE RAFT WHEN MY UNCLE LAID HIS HAND UPON MY SHOULDER WE SHALL NOT SAIL UNTIL TO MORROW HE SAID
887-123290-0012 I WILL NOT LEAVE IT UNTIL I HAVE EXAMINED IT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT FOLLOWED IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND THAT
887-123290-0013 WE WERE NOT REALLY WHERE THE PROFESSOR SUPPOSED WE WERE IN FACT WE WERE NOT UPON THE NORTH SHORE OF THE SEA NOW LET US START UPON FRESH DISCOVERIES I SAID AND LEAVING HANS TO HIS WORK WE STARTED OFF TOGETHER
887-123290-0014 THE SPACE BETWEEN THE WATER AND THE FOOT OF THE CLIFFS WAS CONSIDERABLE IT TOOK HALF AN HOUR TO BRING US TO THE WALL OF ROCK WE TRAMPLED UNDER OUR FEET NUMBERLESS SHELLS OF ALL THE FORMS AND SIZES WHICH EXISTED IN THE EARLIEST AGES OF THE WORLD
887-123290-0015 I ALSO SAW IMMENSE CARAPACES MORE THAN FIFTEEN FEET IN DIAMETER
887-123290-0016 AND RIDGED UP IN SUCCESSIVE LINES I WAS THEREFORE LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT AT ONE TIME THE SEA MUST HAVE COVERED THE GROUND ON WHICH WE WERE TREADING ON THE LOOSE AND SCATTERED ROCKS
887-123290-0017 THE WAVES HAD LEFT MANIFEST TRACES OF THEIR POWER TO WEAR THEIR WAY IN THE HARDEST STONE THIS MIGHT UP TO A CERTAIN POINT EXPLAIN THE EXISTENCE OF AN OCEAN FORTY LEAGUES BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE BUT IN MY OPINION
887-123290-0018 THIS LIQUID MASS WOULD BE LOST BY DEGREES FARTHER AND FARTHER WITHIN THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH AND IT CERTAINLY HAD ITS ORIGIN IN THE WATERS OF THE OCEAN OVERHEAD WHICH HAD MADE THEIR WAY HITHER THROUGH SOME FISSURE YET
887-123290-0019 IT MUST BE BELIEVED THAT THAT FISSURE IS NOW CLOSED AND THAT ALL THIS CAVERN OR IMMENSE RESERVOIR WAS FILLED IN A VERY SHORT TIME PERHAPS EVEN THIS WATER SUBJECTED TO THE FIERCE ACTION OF CENTRAL HEAT HAD PARTLY BEEN RESOLVED INTO VAPOUR
887-123290-0020 AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT ELECTRICITY WHICH RAISED SUCH TEMPESTS WITHIN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH THIS THEORY OF THE PHENOMENA WE HAD WITNESSED SEEMED SATISFACTORY TO ME FOR HOWEVER GREAT AND STUPENDOUS THE PHENOMENA OF NATURE
887-123290-0021 FIXED PHYSICAL LAWS WILL OR MAY ALWAYS EXPLAIN THEM WE WERE THEREFORE WALKING UPON SEDIMENTARY SOIL THE DEPOSITS OF THE WATERS OF FORMER AGES THE PROFESSOR WAS CAREFULLY EXAMINING EVERY LITTLE FISSURE IN THE ROCKS
887-123290-0022 WHEREVER HE SAW A HOLE HE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF IT TO HIM THIS WAS IMPORTANT WE HAD TRAVERSED THE SHORES OF THE LIEDENBROCK SEA FOR A MILE WHEN WE OBSERVED A SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE SOIL IT SEEMED UPSET CONTORTED
887-123290-0023 WHERE THE REMAINS OF TWENTY AGES MINGLED THEIR DUST TOGETHER HUGE MOUNDS OF BONY FRAGMENTS ROSE STAGE AFTER STAGE IN THE DISTANCE THEY UNDULATED AWAY TO THE LIMITS OF THE HORIZON AND MELTED IN THE DISTANCE IN A FAINT
887-123290-0024 HAZE THERE WITHIN THREE SQUARE MILES WERE ACCUMULATED THE MATERIALS FOR A COMPLETE HISTORY OF THE ANIMAL LIFE OF AGES A HISTORY SCARCELY OUTLINED IN THE TOO RECENT STRATA OF THE INHABITED WORLD
887-123290-0025 BUT AN IMPATIENT CURIOSITY IMPELLED OUR STEPS CRACKLING AND RATTLING OUR FEET WERE TRAMPLING ON THE REMAINS OF PREHISTORIC ANIMALS AND INTERESTING FOSSILS THE POSSESSION OF WHICH IS A MATTER OF RIVALRY AND CONTENTION
887-123290-0026 A THOUSAND CUVIERS COULD NEVER HAVE RECONSTRUCTED THE ORGANIC REMAINS DEPOSITED IN THIS MAGNIFICENT AND UNPARALLELED COLLECTION I STOOD AMAZED MY UNCLE HAD UPLIFTED HIS LONG ARMS TO THE VAULT WHICH WAS OUR SKY
887-123290-0027 HIS MOUTH GAPING WIDE HIS EYES FLASHING BEHIND HIS SHINING SPECTACLES HIS HEAD BALANCING WITH AN UP AND DOWN MOTION HIS WHOLE ATTITUDE DENOTED UNLIMITED ASTONISHMENT HERE HE STOOD FACING AN IMMENSE COLLECTION OF SCATTERED
887-123290-0028 LEPTOTHERIA MERICOTHERIA LOPHIODIA ANOPLOTHERIA MEGATHERIA MASTODONS PROTOPITHECAE PTERODACTYLES AND ALL SORTS OF EXTINCT MONSTERS HERE ASSEMBLED TOGETHER FOR HIS SPECIAL SATISFACTION
887-123290-0029 FANCY AN ENTHUSIASTIC BIBLIOMANIAC SUDDENLY BROUGHT INTO THE MIDST OF THE FAMOUS ALEXANDRIAN LIBRARY BURNT BY OMAR AND RESTORED BY A MIRACLE FROM ITS ASHES JUST SUCH A CRAZED ENTHUSIAST WAS MY UNCLE PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK
887-123290-0030 BUT MORE WAS TO COME WHEN
887-123290-0031 HE LAID HIS HAND UPON A BARE SKULL AND CRIED WITH A VOICE TREMBLING WITH EXCITEMENT AXEL AXEL A HUMAN HEAD A HUMAN SKULL I CRIED NO LESS ASTONISHED
887-123291-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT THE PROFESSOR IN HIS CHAIR AGAIN TO UNDERSTAND THIS APOSTROPHE OF MY UNCLE'S MADE TO ABSENT FRENCH SAVANTS IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO ALLUDE TO AN EVENT OF HIGH IMPORTANCE
887-123291-0001 IN A PALAEONTOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW WHICH HAD OCCURRED A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE OUR DEPARTURE ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF MARCH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
887-123291-0002 NEAR ABBEVILLE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOMME FOUND A HUMAN JAWBONE FOURTEEN FEET BENEATH THE SURFACE IT WAS THE FIRST FOSSIL OF THIS NATURE THAT HAD EVER BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT NOT FAR DISTANT
887-123291-0003 WERE FOUND STONE HATCHETS AND FLINT ARROW HEADS STAINED AND ENCASED BY LAPSE OF TIME WITH A UNIFORM COAT OF RUST THE NOISE OF THIS DISCOVERY WAS VERY GREAT NOT IN FRANCE ALONE BUT IN ENGLAND AND IN GERMANY
887-123291-0004 SAW AT ONCE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS DISCOVERY PROVED TO DEMONSTRATION THE GENUINENESS OF THE BONE IN QUESTION AND BECAME THE MOST ARDENT DEFENDANTS IN WHAT THE ENGLISH CALLED THIS TRIAL OF A JAWBONE
887-123291-0005 THEREFORE THE GENUINENESS OF A FOSSIL HUMAN RELIC OF THE QUATERNARY PERIOD SEEMED TO BE INCONTESTABLY PROVED AND ADMITTED IT IS TRUE THAT THIS THEORY MET WITH A MOST OBSTINATE OPPONENT
887-123291-0006 AND AGREEING IN THAT WITH CUVIER HE REFUSED TO ADMIT THAT THE HUMAN SPECIES COULD BE CONTEMPORARY WITH THE ANIMALS OF THE QUATERNARY PERIOD MY UNCLE LIEDENBROCK ALONG WITH THE GREAT BODY OF THE GEOLOGISTS HAD MAINTAINED HIS GROUND DISPUTED AND ARGUED UNTIL
887-123291-0007 WE KNEW ALL THESE DETAILS BUT WE WERE NOT AWARE THAT SINCE OUR DEPARTURE THE QUESTION HAD ADVANCED TO FARTHER STAGES OTHER SIMILAR MAXILLARIES THOUGH BELONGING TO INDIVIDUALS OF VARIOUS TYPES AND DIFFERENT NATIONS WERE FOUND IN THE LOOSE GREY SOIL
887-123291-0008 OF CERTAIN GROTTOES IN FRANCE SWITZERLAND AND BELGIUM AS WELL AS WEAPONS TOOLS EARTHEN UTENSILS BONES OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS THE EXISTENCE THEREFORE OF MAN IN THE QUATERNARY PERIOD SEEMED TO BECOME DAILY MORE CERTAIN
887-123291-0009 NOR WAS THIS ALL FRESH DISCOVERIES OF REMAINS IN THE PLEIOCENE FORMATION HAD EMBOLDENED OTHER GEOLOGISTS TO REFER BACK THE HUMAN SPECIES TO A HIGHER ANTIQUITY STILL IT IS TRUE THAT THESE REMAINS WERE NOT HUMAN BONES
887-123291-0010 BUT OBJECTS BEARING THE TRACES OF HIS HANDIWORK SUCH AS FOSSIL LEG BONES OF ANIMALS SCULPTURED AND CARVED EVIDENTLY BY THE HAND OF MAN
887-123291-0011 HE WAS A PREDECESSOR OF THE MASTODON HE WAS A CONTEMPORARY OF THE SOUTHERN ELEPHANT HE LIVED A HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AGO WHEN ACCORDING TO GEOLOGISTS THE PLEIOCENE FORMATION WAS IN PROGRESS
887-123291-0012 SUCH THEN WAS THE STATE OF PALAEONTOLOGICAL SCIENCE AND WHAT WE KNEW OF IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN OUR BEHAVIOUR IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS STUPENDOUS GOLGOTHA ANY ONE MAY NOW UNDERSTAND THE FRENZIED EXCITEMENT OF MY UNCLE WHEN
887-123291-0013 TWENTY YARDS FARTHER ON HE FOUND HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH A PRIMITIVE MAN IT WAS A PERFECTLY RECOGNISABLE HUMAN BODY HAD SOME PARTICULAR SOIL LIKE THAT OF THE CEMETERY SAINT MICHEL AT BORDEAUX
887-123291-0014 PRESERVED IT THUS FOR SO MANY AGES IT MIGHT BE SO BUT THIS DRIED CORPSE WITH ITS PARCHMENT LIKE SKIN DRAWN TIGHTLY OVER THE BONY FRAME THE LIMBS STILL PRESERVING THEIR SHAPE SOUND TEETH ABUNDANT HAIR
887-123291-0015 AND FINGER AND TOE NAILS OF FRIGHTFUL LENGTH THIS DESICCATED MUMMY STARTLED US BY APPEARING JUST AS IT HAD LIVED COUNTLESS AGES AGO I STOOD MUTE BEFORE THIS APPARITION OF REMOTE ANTIQUITY MY UNCLE USUALLY SO GARRULOUS
887-123291-0016 WAS STRUCK DUMB LIKEWISE WE RAISED THE BODY WE STOOD IT UP AGAINST A ROCK IT SEEMED TO STARE AT US OUT OF ITS EMPTY ORBITS WE SOUNDED WITH OUR KNUCKLES HIS HOLLOW FRAME AFTER SOME MOMENTS SILENCE THE PROFESSOR WAS HIMSELF AGAIN
887-123291-0017 OTTO LIEDENBROCK YIELDING TO HIS NATURE FORGOT ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR EVENTFUL JOURNEY FORGOT WHERE WE WERE STANDING FORGOT THE VAULTED CAVERN WHICH CONTAINED US NO DOUBT HE WAS IN MIND BACK AGAIN IN HIS JOHANNAEUM
887-123291-0018 HOLDING FORTH TO HIS PUPILS FOR HE ASSUMED HIS LEARNED AIR AND ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO AN IMAGINARY AUDIENCE HE PROCEEDED THUS GENTLEMEN I HAVE THE HONOUR TO INTRODUCE TO YOU A MAN OF THE QUATERNARY OR POST TERTIARY SYSTEM
887-123291-0019 EMINENT GEOLOGISTS HAVE DENIED HIS EXISTENCE OTHERS NO LESS EMINENT HAVE AFFIRMED IT THE SAINT THOMASES OF PALAEONTOLOGY IF THEY WERE HERE MIGHT NOW TOUCH HIM WITH THEIR FINGERS AND WOULD BE OBLIGED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR ERROR
887-123291-0020 I AM QUITE AWARE THAT SCIENCE HAS TO BE ON ITS GUARD WITH DISCOVERIES OF THIS KIND I KNOW WHAT CAPITAL ENTERPRISING INDIVIDUALS LIKE BARNUM HAVE MADE OUT OF FOSSIL MEN I HAVE HEARD THE TALE OF THE KNEEPAN OF AJAX
887-123291-0021 THE PRETENDED BODY OF ORESTES CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN FOUND BY THE SPARTANS AND OF THE BODY OF ASTERIUS TEN CUBITS LONG
887-123291-0022 I HAVE READ THE REPORTS OF THE SKELETON OF TRAPANI FOUND IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY AND WHICH WAS AT THE TIME IDENTIFIED AS THAT OF POLYPHEMUS AND THE HISTORY OF THE GIANT UNEARTHED IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY NEAR PALERMO
887-123291-0023 YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO GENTLEMEN THE ANALYSIS MADE AT LUCERNE IN FIFTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN OF THOSE HUGE BONES WHICH THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR FELIX PLATER AFFIRMED TO BE THOSE OF A GIANT NINETEEN FEET HIGH
887-123291-0024 IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY I WOULD HAVE STOOD UP FOR SCHEUCHZER'S PRE ADAMITE MAN AGAINST PETER CAMPET I HAVE PERUSED A WRITING
887-123291-0025 HERE MY UNCLE'S UNFORTUNATE INFIRMITY MET HIM THAT OF BEING UNABLE IN PUBLIC TO PRONOUNCE HARD WORDS
887-123291-0026 HE COULD GET NO FURTHER
887-123291-0027 IT WAS NOT TO BE DONE THE UNLUCKY WORD WOULD NOT COME OUT AT THE JOHANNAEUM THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LAUGH GIGANTOSTEOLOGIE AT LAST THE PROFESSOR BURST OUT BETWEEN TWO WORDS WHICH I SHALL NOT RECORD HERE
887-123291-0028 HAVE RECOGNISED IN THESE BONES NOTHING MORE REMARKABLE THAN THE BONES OF THE MAMMOTH AND OTHER MAMMALS OF THE POST TERTIARY PERIOD BUT IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS SPECIMEN TO DOUBT WOULD BE TO INSULT SCIENCE THERE STANDS THE BODY YOU MAY SEE IT TOUCH IT
887-123291-0029 IT IS NOT A MERE SKELETON IT IS AN ENTIRE BODY
887-123291-0030 I WAS GOOD ENOUGH NOT TO CONTRADICT THIS STARTLING ASSERTION IF I COULD ONLY WASH IT IN A SOLUTION OF SULPHURIC ACID PURSUED MY UNCLE I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CLEAR IT FROM ALL THE EARTHY PARTICLES AND THE SHELLS WHICH ARE INCRUSTED ABOUT IT
887-123291-0031 BUT I DO NOT POSSESS THAT VALUABLE SOLVENT YET SUCH AS IT IS THE BODY SHALL TELL US ITS OWN WONDERFUL STORY HERE THE PROFESSOR LAID HOLD OF THE FOSSIL SKELETON AND HANDLED IT WITH THE SKILL OF A DEXTEROUS SHOWMAN
887-123291-0032 YOU SEE HE SAID THAT IT IS NOT SIX FEET LONG AND THAT WE ARE STILL SEPARATED BY A LONG INTERVAL FROM THE PRETENDED RACE OF GIANTS
887-123291-0033 IT IS EVIDENTLY CAUCASIAN IT IS THE WHITE RACE OUR OWN THE SKULL OF THIS FOSSIL IS A REGULAR OVAL OR RATHER OVOID IT EXHIBITS NO PROMINENT CHEEKBONES NO PROJECTING JAWS
887-123291-0034 IT PRESENTS NO APPEARANCE OF THAT PROGNATHISM
887-123291-0035 IT IS NEARLY NINETY DEGREES BUT I WILL GO FURTHER IN MY DEDUCTIONS AND I WILL AFFIRM THAT THIS SPECIMEN OF THE HUMAN FAMILY IS OF THE JAPHETIC RACE WHICH HAS SINCE SPREAD FROM THE INDIES TO THE ATLANTIC DON'T SMILE GENTLEMEN NOBODY WAS SMILING
887-123291-0036 BUT THE LEARNED PROFESSOR WAS FREQUENTLY DISTURBED BY THE BROAD SMILES PROVOKED BY HIS LEARNED ECCENTRICITIES YES HE PURSUED WITH ANIMATION THIS IS A FOSSIL MAN THE CONTEMPORARY OF THE MASTODONS WHOSE REMAINS FILL THIS AMPHITHEATRE
887-123291-0037 HOW THOSE STRATA ON WHICH HE LAY SLIPPED DOWN INTO THIS ENORMOUS HOLLOW IN THE GLOBE I CONFESS I CANNOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION
887-123291-0038 CONSIDERABLE COMMOTIONS WERE STILL DISTURBING THE CRUST OF THE EARTH THE LONG CONTINUED COOLING OF THE GLOBE PRODUCED CHASMS FISSURES CLEFTS AND FAULTS INTO WHICH VERY PROBABLY PORTIONS OF THE UPPER EARTH MAY HAVE FALLEN
887-123291-0039 BUT THERE IS THE MAN SURROUNDED BY HIS OWN WORKS BY HATCHETS BY FLINT ARROW HEADS
887-123291-0040 THIS FOSSIL BODY WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE IN THIS IMMENSE CATACOMB WE CAME UPON OTHER BODIES AT EVERY STEP AMONGST THIS MORTAL DUST AND MY UNCLE MIGHT SELECT THE MOST CURIOUS OF THESE SPECIMENS TO DEMOLISH THE INCREDULITY OF SCEPTICS
887-123291-0041 IN FACT IT WAS A WONDERFUL SPECTACLE THAT OF THESE GENERATIONS OF MEN AND ANIMALS COMMINGLED IN A COMMON CEMETERY THEN ONE VERY SERIOUS QUESTION AROSE PRESENTLY WHICH WE SCARCELY DARED TO SUGGEST
887-123291-0042 HAD ALL THOSE CREATURES SLIDED THROUGH A GREAT FISSURE IN THE CRUST OF THE EARTH DOWN TO THE SHORES OF THE LIEDENBROCK SEA WHEN THEY WERE DEAD AND TURNING TO DUST OR HAD THEY LIVED AND GROWN AND DIED HERE IN THIS SUBTERRANEAN WORLD UNDER A FALSE SKY
89-218-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE A MOMENT'S GLANCE WAS ENOUGH TO SATISFY CATHERINE THAT HER APARTMENT WAS VERY UNLIKE THE ONE WHICH HENRY HAD ENDEAVOURED TO ALARM HER BY THE DESCRIPTION OF IT WAS BY NO MEANS UNREASONABLY LARGE AND CONTAINED NEITHER TAPESTRY NOR VELVET
89-218-0001 THE WALLS WERE PAPERED THE FLOOR WAS CARPETED THE WINDOWS WERE NEITHER LESS PERFECT NOR MORE DIM THAN THOSE OF THE DRAWING ROOM BELOW THE FURNITURE THOUGH NOT OF THE LATEST FASHION WAS HANDSOME AND COMFORTABLE AND THE AIR OF THE ROOM ALTOGETHER FAR FROM UNCHEERFUL
89-218-0002 HER HEART INSTANTANEOUSLY AT EASE ON THIS POINT SHE RESOLVED TO LOSE NO TIME IN PARTICULAR EXAMINATION OF ANYTHING AS SHE GREATLY DREADED DISOBLIGING THE GENERAL BY ANY DELAY
89-218-0003 AND SHE WAS PREPARING TO UNPIN THE LINEN PACKAGE WHICH THE CHAISE SEAT HAD CONVEYED FOR HER IMMEDIATE ACCOMMODATION WHEN HER EYE SUDDENLY FELL ON A LARGE HIGH CHEST STANDING BACK IN A DEEP RECESS ON ONE SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE THE SIGHT OF IT MADE HER START
89-218-0004 AND FORGETTING EVERYTHING ELSE SHE STOOD GAZING ON IT IN MOTIONLESS WONDER WHILE THESE THOUGHTS CROSSED HER
89-218-0005 PUSHED BACK TOO AS IF MEANT TO BE OUT OF SIGHT I WILL LOOK INTO IT COST ME WHAT IT MAY I WILL LOOK INTO IT AND DIRECTLY TOO BY DAYLIGHT IF I STAY TILL EVENING MY CANDLE MAY GO OUT SHE ADVANCED AND EXAMINED IT CLOSELY
89-218-0006 IT WAS OF CEDAR CURIOUSLY INLAID WITH SOME DARKER WOOD AND RAISED ABOUT A FOOT FROM THE GROUND ON A CARVED STAND OF THE SAME THE LOCK WAS SILVER THOUGH TARNISHED FROM AGE
89-218-0007 BROKEN PERHAPS PREMATURELY BY SOME STRANGE VIOLENCE AND ON THE CENTRE OF THE LID WAS A MYSTERIOUS CIPHER IN THE SAME METAL CATHERINE BENT OVER IT INTENTLY BUT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO DISTINGUISH ANYTHING WITH CERTAINTY SHE COULD NOT IN WHATEVER DIRECTION SHE TOOK IT
89-218-0008 BELIEVE THE LAST LETTER TO BE A T AND YET THAT IT SHOULD BE ANYTHING ELSE IN THAT HOUSE WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE TO RAISE NO COMMON DEGREE OF ASTONISHMENT IF NOT ORIGINALLY THEIRS BY WHAT STRANGE EVENTS COULD IT HAVE FALLEN INTO THE TILNEY FAMILY HER FEARFUL CURIOSITY
89-218-0009 WAS EVERY MOMENT GROWING GREATER AND SEIZING WITH TREMBLING HANDS THE HASP OF THE LOCK SHE RESOLVED AT ALL HAZARDS TO SATISFY HERSELF AT LEAST AS TO ITS CONTENTS WITH DIFFICULTY FOR SOMETHING SEEMED TO RESIST HER EFFORTS SHE RAISED THE LID A FEW INCHES
89-218-0010 BUT AT THAT MOMENT A SUDDEN KNOCKING AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM MADE HER STARTING QUIT HER HOLD AND THE LID CLOSED WITH ALARMING VIOLENCE THIS ILL TIMED INTRUDER WAS MISS TILNEY'S MAID SENT BY HER MISTRESS TO BE OF USE TO MISS MORLAND AND THOUGH CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY DISMISSED HER
89-218-0011 AND FORCED HER IN SPITE OF HER ANXIOUS DESIRE TO PENETRATE THIS MYSTERY TO PROCEED IN HER DRESSING WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY HER PROGRESS WAS NOT QUICK FOR HER THOUGHTS AND HER EYES WERE STILL BENT ON THE OBJECT SO WELL CALCULATED TO INTEREST AND ALARM AND THOUGH SHE DARED NOT WASTE A MOMENT UPON A SECOND ATTEMPT
89-218-0012 SHE COULD NOT REMAIN MANY PACES FROM THE CHEST AT LENGTH HOWEVER HAVING SLIPPED ONE ARM INTO HER GOWN HER TOILETTE SEEMED SO NEARLY FINISHED THAT THE IMPATIENCE OF HER CURIOSITY MIGHT SAFELY BE INDULGED
89-218-0013 AND SO DESPERATE SHOULD BE THE EXERTION OF HER STRENGTH THAT UNLESS SECURED BY SUPERNATURAL MEANS THE LID IN ONE MOMENT SHOULD BE THROWN BACK WITH THIS SPIRIT SHE SPRANG FORWARD AND HER CONFIDENCE DID NOT DECEIVE HER HER RESOLUTE EFFORT THREW BACK THE LID AND GAVE TO HER ASTONISHED EYES
89-218-0014 ENTERED THE ROOM AND TO THE RISING SHAME OF HAVING HARBOURED FOR SOME MINUTES AN ABSURD EXPECTATION WAS THEN ADDED THE SHAME OF BEING CAUGHT IN SO IDLE A SEARCH
89-218-0015 SAID MISS TILNEY AS CATHERINE HASTILY CLOSED IT AND TURNED AWAY TO THE GLASS
89-218-0016 CATHERINE HAD NO LEISURE FOR SPEECH BEING AT ONCE BLUSHING TYING HER GOWN AND FORMING WISE RESOLUTIONS WITH THE MOST VIOLENT DISPATCH MISS TILNEY GENTLY HINTED HER FEAR OF BEING LATE AND IN HALF A MINUTE THEY RAN DOWNSTAIRS TOGETHER IN AN ALARM NOT WHOLLY UNFOUNDED
89-218-0017 FOR GENERAL TILNEY WAS PACING THE DRAWING ROOM HIS WATCH IN HIS HAND AND HAVING ON THE VERY INSTANT OF THEIR ENTERING PULLED THE BELL WITH VIOLENCE ORDERED DINNER TO BE ON TABLE DIRECTLY CATHERINE TREMBLED AT THE EMPHASIS WITH WHICH HE SPOKE
89-218-0018 AND SAT PALE AND BREATHLESS IN A MOST HUMBLE MOOD CONCERNED FOR HIS CHILDREN AND DETESTING OLD CHESTS AND THE GENERAL RECOVERING HIS POLITENESS AS HE LOOKED AT HER SPENT THE REST OF HIS TIME IN SCOLDING HIS DAUGHTER FOR SO FOOLISHLY HURRYING HER FAIR FRIEND
89-218-0019 WHO WAS ABSOLUTELY OUT OF BREATH FROM HASTE WHEN THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST OCCASION FOR HURRY IN THE WORLD
89-218-0020 TILL THEY WERE HAPPILY SEATED AT THE DINNER TABLE WHEN THE GENERAL'S COMPLACENT SMILES AND A GOOD APPETITE OF HER OWN RESTORED HER TO PEACE THE DINING PARLOUR WAS A NOBLE ROOM
89-218-0021 AND FITTED UP IN A STYLE OF LUXURY AND EXPENSE WHICH WAS ALMOST LOST ON THE UNPRACTISED EYE OF CATHERINE WHO SAW LITTLE MORE THAN ITS SPACIOUSNESS AND THE NUMBER OF THEIR ATTENDANTS OF THE FORMER SHE SPOKE ALOUD HER ADMIRATION AND THE GENERAL WITH A VERY GRACIOUS COUNTENANCE
89-218-0022 ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS BY NO MEANS AN ILL SIZED ROOM AND FURTHER CONFESSED THAT THOUGH AS CARELESS ON SUCH SUBJECTS AS MOST PEOPLE HE DID LOOK UPON A TOLERABLY LARGE EATING ROOM AS ONE OF THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE HE SUPPOSED HOWEVER
89-218-0023 THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN USED TO MUCH BETTER SIZED APARTMENTS AT MISTER ALLEN'S NO INDEED WAS CATHERINE'S HONEST ASSURANCE MISTER ALLEN'S DINING PARLOUR WAS NOT MORE THAN HALF AS LARGE AND SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SO LARGE A ROOM AS THIS IN HER LIFE
89-218-0024 THE GENERAL'S GOOD HUMOUR INCREASED WHY AS HE HAD SUCH ROOMS HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SIMPLE NOT TO MAKE USE OF THEM
89-218-0025 MISTER ALLEN'S HOUSE HE WAS SURE MUST BE EXACTLY OF THE TRUE SIZE FOR RATIONAL HAPPINESS THE EVENING PASSED WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DISTURBANCE AND IN THE OCCASIONAL ABSENCE OF GENERAL TILNEY WITH MUCH POSITIVE CHEERFULNESS
89-218-0026 IT WAS ONLY IN HIS PRESENCE THAT CATHERINE FELT THE SMALLEST FATIGUE FROM HER JOURNEY AND EVEN THEN EVEN IN MOMENTS OF LANGUOR OR RESTRAINT A SENSE OF GENERAL HAPPINESS PREPONDERATED AND SHE COULD THINK OF HER FRIENDS IN BATH WITHOUT ONE WISH OF BEING WITH THEM THE NIGHT WAS STORMY
89-218-0027 THE WIND HAD BEEN RISING AT INTERVALS THE WHOLE AFTERNOON AND BY THE TIME THE PARTY BROKE UP IT BLEW AND RAINED VIOLENTLY CATHERINE AS SHE CROSSED THE HALL LISTENED TO THE TEMPEST WITH SENSATIONS OF AWE AND WHEN SHE HEARD IT RAGE ROUND A CORNER OF THE ANCIENT BUILDING AND CLOSE WITH SUDDEN FURY A DISTANT DOOR
89-218-0028 YES THESE WERE CHARACTERISTIC SOUNDS THEY BROUGHT TO HER RECOLLECTION A COUNTLESS VARIETY OF DREADFUL SITUATIONS AND HORRID SCENES WHICH SUCH BUILDINGS HAD WITNESSED AND SUCH STORMS USHERED IN
89-218-0029 AND MOST HEARTILY DID SHE REJOICE IN THE HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HER ENTRANCE WITHIN WALLS SO SOLEMN SHE HAD NOTHING TO DREAD FROM MIDNIGHT ASSASSINS OR DRUNKEN GALLANTS
89-218-0030 HENRY HAD CERTAINLY BEEN ONLY IN JEST IN WHAT HE HAD TOLD HER THAT MORNING IN A HOUSE SO FURNISHED AND SO GUARDED SHE COULD HAVE NOTHING TO EXPLORE OR TO SUFFER AND MIGHT GO TO HER BEDROOM AS SECURELY AS IF IT HAD BEEN HER OWN CHAMBER AT FULLERTON
89-218-0031 SHE WAS ENABLED ESPECIALLY ON PERCEIVING THAT MISS TILNEY SLEPT ONLY TWO DOORS FROM HER TO ENTER HER ROOM WITH A TOLERABLY STOUT HEART AND HER SPIRITS WERE IMMEDIATELY ASSISTED BY THE CHEERFUL BLAZE OF A WOOD FIRE
89-218-0032 AS SO MANY POOR GIRLS HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO DO AND THEN TO HAVE A FAITHFUL OLD SERVANT FRIGHTENING ONE BY COMING IN WITH A FAGGOT HOW GLAD I AM THAT NORTHANGER IS WHAT IT IS IF IT HAD BEEN LIKE SOME OTHER PLACES I DO NOT KNOW THAT IN SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS
89-218-0033 I COULD HAVE ANSWERED FOR MY COURAGE BUT NOW TO BE SURE THERE IS NOTHING TO ALARM ONE SHE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM THE WINDOW CURTAINS SEEMED IN MOTION
89-218-0034 A GLANCE AT THE OLD CHEST AS SHE TURNED AWAY FROM THIS EXAMINATION WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS USE SHE SCORNED THE CAUSELESS FEARS OF AN IDLE FANCY AND BEGAN WITH A MOST HAPPY INDIFFERENCE TO PREPARE HERSELF FOR BED SHE SHOULD TAKE HER TIME SHE SHOULD NOT HURRY HERSELF
89-218-0035 AS IF SHE WISHED FOR THE PROTECTION OF LIGHT AFTER SHE WERE IN BED THE FIRE THEREFORE DIED AWAY AND CATHERINE HAVING SPENT THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR IN HER ARRANGEMENTS WAS BEGINNING TO THINK OF STEPPING INTO BED WHEN ON GIVING A PARTING GLANCE ROUND THE ROOM
89-218-0036 SHE WAS STRUCK BY THE APPEARANCE OF A HIGH OLD FASHIONED BLACK CABINET WHICH THOUGH IN A SITUATION CONSPICUOUS ENOUGH HAD NEVER CAUGHT HER NOTICE BEFORE HENRY'S WORDS HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE EBONY CABINET WHICH WAS TO ESCAPE HER OBSERVATION AT FIRST
89-218-0037 IMMEDIATELY RUSHED ACROSS HER AND THOUGH THERE COULD BE NOTHING REALLY IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING WHIMSICAL IT WAS CERTAINLY A VERY REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE SHE TOOK HER CANDLE AND LOOKED CLOSELY AT THE CABINET IT WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY EBONY AND GOLD
89-218-0038 BUT IT WAS JAPAN BLACK AND YELLOW JAPAN OF THE HANDSOMEST KIND AND AS SHE HELD HER CANDLE THE YELLOW HAD VERY MUCH THE EFFECT OF GOLD THE KEY WAS IN THE DOOR AND SHE HAD A STRANGE FANCY TO LOOK INTO IT NOT HOWEVER WITH THE SMALLEST EXPECTATION OF FINDING ANYTHING
89-218-0039 BUT IT WAS SO VERY ODD AFTER WHAT HENRY HAD SAID IN SHORT SHE COULD NOT SLEEP TILL SHE HAD EXAMINED IT SO PLACING THE CANDLE WITH GREAT CAUTION ON A CHAIR SHE SEIZED THE KEY WITH A VERY TREMULOUS HAND AND TRIED TO TURN IT BUT IT RESISTED HER UTMOST STRENGTH
89-218-0040 ALARMED BUT NOT DISCOURAGED SHE TRIED IT ANOTHER WAY A BOLT FLEW AND SHE BELIEVED HERSELF SUCCESSFUL BUT HOW STRANGELY MYSTERIOUS THE DOOR WAS STILL IMMOVABLE SHE PAUSED A MOMENT IN BREATHLESS WONDER
89-218-0041 THE WIND ROARED DOWN THE CHIMNEY THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE WINDOWS AND EVERYTHING SEEMED TO SPEAK THE AWFULNESS OF HER SITUATION
89-218-0042 TO RETIRE TO BED HOWEVER UNSATISFIED ON SUCH A POINT WOULD BE VAIN SINCE SLEEP MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A CABINET SO MYSTERIOUSLY CLOSED IN HER IMMEDIATE VICINITY AGAIN THEREFORE SHE APPLIED HERSELF TO THE KEY
89-218-0043 AND AFTER MOVING IT IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY FOR SOME INSTANTS WITH THE DETERMINED CELERITY OF HOPE'S LAST EFFORT THE DOOR SUDDENLY YIELDED TO HER HAND HER HEART LEAPED WITH EXULTATION AT SUCH A VICTORY
89-218-0044 AND HAVING THROWN OPEN EACH FOLDING DOOR THE SECOND BEING SECURED ONLY BY BOLTS OF LESS WONDERFUL CONSTRUCTION THAN THE LOCK THOUGH IN THAT HER EYE COULD NOT DISCERN ANYTHING UNUSUAL A DOUBLE RANGE OF SMALL DRAWERS APPEARED IN VIEW WITH SOME LARGER DRAWERS ABOVE AND BELOW THEM AND IN THE CENTRE
89-218-0045 A SMALL DOOR CLOSED ALSO WITH A LOCK AND KEY SECURED IN ALL PROBABILITY A CAVITY OF IMPORTANCE CATHERINE'S HEART BEAT QUICK BUT HER COURAGE DID NOT FAIL HER WITH A CHEEK FLUSHED BY HOPE AND AN EYE STRAINING WITH CURIOSITY
89-218-0046 HER FINGERS GRASPED THE HANDLE OF A DRAWER AND DREW IT FORTH IT WAS ENTIRELY EMPTY WITH LESS ALARM AND GREATER EAGERNESS SHE SEIZED A SECOND A THIRD A FOURTH EACH WAS EQUALLY EMPTY NOT ONE WAS LEFT UNSEARCHED
89-218-0047 AND IN NOT ONE WAS ANYTHING FOUND WELL READ IN THE ART OF CONCEALING A TREASURE THE POSSIBILITY OF FALSE LININGS TO THE DRAWERS DID NOT ESCAPE HER AND SHE FELT ROUND EACH WITH ANXIOUS ACUTENESS IN VAIN THE PLACE IN THE MIDDLE ALONE REMAINED NOW UNEXPLORED AND THOUGH SHE HAD
89-218-0048 HER QUICK EYES DIRECTLY FELL ON A ROLL OF PAPER PUSHED BACK INTO THE FURTHER PART OF THE CAVITY APPARENTLY FOR CONCEALMENT AND HER FEELINGS AT THAT MOMENT WERE INDESCRIBABLE HER HEART FLUTTERED HER KNEES TREMBLED AND HER CHEEKS GREW PALE
89-218-0049 SHE SEIZED WITH AN UNSTEADY HAND THE PRECIOUS MANUSCRIPT
89-218-0050 AND WHILE SHE ACKNOWLEDGED WITH AWFUL SENSATIONS THIS STRIKING EXEMPLIFICATION OF WHAT HENRY HAD FORETOLD RESOLVED INSTANTLY TO PERUSE EVERY LINE BEFORE SHE ATTEMPTED TO REST THE DIMNESS OF THE LIGHT HER CANDLE EMITTED MADE HER TURN TO IT WITH ALARM
89-218-0051 A LAMP COULD NOT HAVE EXPIRED WITH MORE AWFUL EFFECT CATHERINE FOR A FEW MOMENTS WAS MOTIONLESS WITH HORROR IT WAS DONE COMPLETELY NOT A REMNANT OF LIGHT IN THE WICK COULD GIVE HOPE TO THE REKINDLING BREATH DARKNESS IMPENETRABLE AND IMMOVABLE FILLED THE ROOM
89-218-0052 A VIOLENT GUST OF WIND RISING WITH SUDDEN FURY ADDED FRESH HORROR TO THE MOMENT CATHERINE TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN THE PAUSE WHICH SUCCEEDED A SOUND LIKE RECEDING FOOTSTEPS AND THE CLOSING OF A DISTANT DOOR
89-218-0053 STRUCK ON HER AFFRIGHTED EAR HUMAN NATURE COULD SUPPORT NO MORE A COLD SWEAT STOOD ON HER FOREHEAD THE MANUSCRIPT FELL FROM HER HAND AND GROPING HER WAY TO THE BED SHE JUMPED HASTILY IN AND SOUGHT SOME SUSPENSION OF AGONY BY CREEPING FAR UNDERNEATH THE CLOTHES
89-218-0054 TO CLOSE HER EYES IN SLEEP THAT NIGHT SHE FELT MUST BE ENTIRELY OUT OF THE QUESTION WITH A CURIOSITY SO JUSTLY AWAKENED AND FEELINGS IN EVERY WAY SO AGITATED REPOSE MUST BE ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE THE STORM TOO ABROAD SO DREADFUL
89-218-0055 SHE HAD NOT BEEN USED TO FEEL ALARM FROM WIND BUT NOW EVERY BLAST SEEMED FRAUGHT WITH AWFUL INTELLIGENCE THE MANUSCRIPT SO WONDERFULLY FOUND SO WONDERFULLY ACCOMPLISHING THE MORNING'S PREDICTION HOW WAS IT TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR WHAT COULD IT CONTAIN
89-218-0056 BY WHAT MEANS COULD IT HAVE BEEN SO LONG CONCEALED AND HOW SINGULARLY STRANGE THAT IT SHOULD FALL TO HER LOT TO DISCOVER IT TILL SHE HAD MADE HERSELF MISTRESS OF ITS CONTENTS HOWEVER SHE COULD HAVE NEITHER REPOSE NOR COMFORT AND WITH THE SUN'S FIRST RAYS SHE WAS DETERMINED TO PERUSE IT
89-218-0057 AS IF BY THE ATTEMPT OF SOMEBODY TO ENTER HOLLOW MURMURS SEEMED TO CREEP ALONG THE GALLERY AND MORE THAN ONCE HER BLOOD WAS CHILLED BY THE SOUND OF DISTANT MOANS
89-219-0000 INSTANTANEOUSLY WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF EXISTENCE RETURNED HER RECOLLECTION OF THE MANUSCRIPT AND SPRINGING FROM THE BED IN THE VERY MOMENT OF THE MAID'S GOING AWAY SHE EAGERLY COLLECTED EVERY SCATTERED SHEET WHICH HAD BURST FROM THE ROLL ON ITS FALLING TO THE GROUND AND FLEW BACK TO ENJOY THE LUXURY OF THEIR PERUSAL ON HER PILLOW
89-219-0001 SHE NOW PLAINLY SAW THAT SHE MUST NOT EXPECT A MANUSCRIPT OF EQUAL LENGTH WITH THE GENERALITY OF WHAT SHE HAD SHUDDERED OVER IN BOOKS FOR THE ROLL SEEMING TO CONSIST ENTIRELY OF SMALL DISJOINTED SHEETS WAS ALTOGETHER BUT OF TRIFLING SIZE
89-219-0002 AND MUCH LESS THAN SHE HAD SUPPOSED IT TO BE AT FIRST HER GREEDY EYE GLANCED RAPIDLY OVER A PAGE SHE STARTED AT ITS IMPORT COULD IT BE POSSIBLE OR DID NOT HER SENSES PLAY HER FALSE AN INVENTORY OF LINEN
89-219-0003 IN COARSE AND MODERN CHARACTERS SEEMED ALL THAT WAS BEFORE HER IF THE EVIDENCE OF SIGHT MIGHT BE TRUSTED SHE HELD A WASHING BILL IN HER HAND SHE SEIZED ANOTHER SHEET AND SAW THE SAME ARTICLES WITH LITTLE VARIATION A THIRD A FOURTH AND A FIFTH PRESENTED NOTHING NEW
89-219-0004 SHIRTS STOCKINGS CRAVATS AND WAISTCOATS FACED HER IN EACH TWO OTHERS PENNED BY THE SAME HAND MARKED AN EXPENDITURE SCARCELY MORE INTERESTING IN LETTERS HAIR POWDER SHOE STRING AND BREECHES BALL AND THE LARGER SHEET
89-219-0005 TO SUPPOSE THAT A MANUSCRIPT OF MANY GENERATIONS BACK COULD HAVE REMAINED UNDISCOVERED IN A ROOM SUCH AS THAT SO MODERN SO HABITABLE
89-219-0006 FOR HAD NOT THE CABINET APPEARED SO EXACTLY TO AGREE WITH HIS DESCRIPTION OF HER ADVENTURES SHE SHOULD NEVER HAVE FELT THE SMALLEST CURIOSITY ABOUT IT THIS WAS THE ONLY COMFORT THAT OCCURRED IMPATIENT TO GET RID OF THOSE HATEFUL EVIDENCES OF HER FOLLY THOSE DETESTABLE PAPERS THEN SCATTERED OVER THE BED
89-219-0007 FOR SHE COULD NOW MANAGE THEM WITH PERFECT EASE IN THIS THERE WAS SURELY SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS AND SHE INDULGED IN THE FLATTERING SUGGESTION FOR HALF A MINUTE TILL THE POSSIBILITY OF THE DOOR'S HAVING BEEN AT FIRST UNLOCKED
89-219-0008 AND YET UNEQUAL TO AN ABSOLUTE FALSEHOOD
89-219-0009 BUT WE HAVE A CHARMING MORNING AFTER IT SHE ADDED DESIRING TO GET RID OF THE SUBJECT
89-219-0010 AND HOW MIGHT YOU LEARN BY ACCIDENT OR ARGUMENT
89-219-0011 AS A MEANS OF GETTING YOU OUT OF DOORS AND TEMPTING YOU TO MORE FREQUENT EXERCISE THAN YOU WOULD OTHERWISE TAKE AND THOUGH THE LOVE OF A HYACINTH MAY BE RATHER DOMESTIC WHO CAN TELL THE SENTIMENT ONCE RAISED BUT YOU MAY IN TIME COME TO LOVE A ROSE
89-219-0012 BUT I DO NOT WANT ANY SUCH PURSUIT TO GET ME OUT OF DOORS THE PLEASURE OF WALKING AND BREATHING FRESH AIR IS ENOUGH FOR ME
89-219-0013 MAMMA SAYS I AM NEVER WITHIN
89-219-0014 THE MERE HABIT OF LEARNING TO LOVE IS THE THING AND A TEACHABLENESS OF DISPOSITION IN A YOUNG LADY IS A GREAT BLESSING HAS MY SISTER A PLEASANT MODE OF INSTRUCTION CATHERINE WAS SAVED THE EMBARRASSMENT OF ATTEMPTING AN ANSWER BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE GENERAL
89-219-0015 WHOSE SMILING COMPLIMENTS ANNOUNCED A HAPPY STATE OF MIND BUT WHOSE GENTLE HINT OF SYMPATHETIC EARLY RISING DID NOT ADVANCE HER COMPOSURE THE ELEGANCE OF THE BREAKFAST SET FORCED ITSELF ON CATHERINE'S NOTICE WHEN THEY WERE SEATED AT TABLE AND LUCIDLY IT HAD BEEN THE GENERAL'S CHOICE
89-219-0016 HE WAS ENCHANTED BY HER APPROBATION OF HIS TASTE CONFESSED IT TO BE NEAT AND SIMPLE THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO ENCOURAGE THE MANUFACTURE OF HIS COUNTRY AND FOR HIS PART TO HIS UNCRITICAL PALATE THE TEA WAS AS WELL FLAVOURED FROM THE CLAY OF STAFFORDSHIRE
89-219-0017 HE TRUSTED HOWEVER THAT AN OPPORTUNITY MIGHT ERE LONG OCCUR OF SELECTING ONE THOUGH NOT FOR HIMSELF CATHERINE WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIM
89-219-0018 SHORTLY AFTER BREAKFAST HENRY LEFT THEM FOR WOODSTON WHERE BUSINESS REQUIRED AND WOULD KEEP HIM TWO OR THREE DAYS THEY ALL ATTENDED IN THE HALL TO SEE HIM MOUNT HIS HORSE AND IMMEDIATELY ON RE ENTERING THE BREAKFAST ROOM CATHERINE WALKED TO A WINDOW IN THE HOPE OF CATCHING ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF HIS FIGURE
89-219-0019 OBSERVED THE GENERAL TO ELEANOR WOODSTON WILL MAKE BUT A SOMBRE APPEARANCE TODAY IS IT A PRETTY PLACE ASKED CATHERINE WHAT SAY YOU ELEANOR SPEAK YOUR OPINION FOR LADIES CAN BEST TELL THE TASTE OF LADIES IN REGARD TO PLACES AS WELL AS MEN
89-219-0020 I THINK IT WOULD BE ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE MOST IMPARTIAL EYE TO HAVE MANY RECOMMENDATIONS THE HOUSE STANDS AMONG FINE MEADOWS FACING THE SOUTH EAST WITH AN EXCELLENT KITCHEN GARDEN IN THE SAME ASPECT
89-219-0021 THE WALLS SURROUNDING WHICH I BUILT AND STOCKED MYSELF ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO FOR THE BENEFIT OF MY SON IT IS A FAMILY LIVING MISS MORLAND AND THE PROPERTY IN THE PLACE BEING CHIEFLY MY OWN YOU MAY BELIEVE I TAKE CARE THAT IT SHALL NOT BE A BAD ONE
89-219-0022 DID HENRY'S INCOME DEPEND SOLELY ON THIS LIVING HE WOULD NOT BE ILL PROVIDED FOR PERHAPS IT MAY SEEM ODD THAT WITH ONLY TWO YOUNGER CHILDREN I SHOULD THINK ANY PROFESSION NECESSARY FOR HIM AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN WE COULD ALL WISH HIM DISENGAGED FROM EVERY TIE OF BUSINESS
89-219-0023 BUT THOUGH I MAY NOT EXACTLY MAKE CONVERTS OF YOU YOUNG LADIES I AM SURE YOUR FATHER MISS MORLAND WOULD AGREE WITH ME IN THINKING IT EXPEDIENT TO GIVE EVERY YOUNG MAN SOME EMPLOYMENT THE MONEY IS NOTHING IT IS NOT AN OBJECT BUT EMPLOYMENT IS THE THING
89-219-0024 HAS HIS PROFESSION THE IMPOSING EFFECT OF THIS LAST ARGUMENT WAS EQUAL TO HIS WISHES THE SILENCE OF THE LADY PROVED IT TO BE UNANSWERABLE SOMETHING HAD BEEN SAID THE EVENING BEFORE OF HER BEING SHOWN OVER THE HOUSE AND HE NOW OFFERED HIMSELF AS HER CONDUCTOR
89-219-0025 AND THOUGH CATHERINE HAD HOPED TO EXPLORE IT ACCOMPANIED ONLY BY HIS DAUGHTER IT WAS A PROPOSAL OF TOO MUCH HAPPINESS IN ITSELF UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES NOT TO BE GLADLY ACCEPTED
89-219-0026 AND HAD SEEN ONLY A FEW OF ITS ROOMS THE NETTING BOX JUST LEISURELY DRAWN FORTH WAS CLOSED WITH JOYFUL HASTE AND SHE WAS READY TO ATTEND HIM IN A MOMENT
89-219-0027 THE PLEASURE OF ACCOMPANYING HER INTO THE SHRUBBERIES AND GARDEN SHE CURTSIED HER ACQUIESCENCE BUT PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE MORE AGREEABLE TO HER TO MAKE THOSE HER FIRST OBJECT
89-219-0028 THE WEATHER WAS AT PRESENT FAVOURABLE AND AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THE UNCERTAINTY WAS VERY GREAT OF ITS CONTINUING SO WHICH WOULD SHE PREFER HE WAS EQUALLY AT HER SERVICE
89-219-0029 HE YIELDED IMPLICITLY AND WOULD FETCH HIS HAT AND ATTEND THEM IN A MOMENT HE LEFT THE ROOM AND CATHERINE WITH A DISAPPOINTED ANXIOUS FACE BEGAN TO SPEAK OF HER UNWILLINGNESS THAT HE SHOULD BE TAKING THEM OUT OF DOORS AGAINST HIS OWN INCLINATION UNDER A MISTAKEN IDEA OF PLEASING HER
89-219-0030 CATHERINE DID NOT EXACTLY KNOW HOW THIS WAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD WHY WAS MISS TILNEY EMBARRASSED COULD THERE BE ANY UNWILLINGNESS ON THE GENERAL'S SIDE TO SHOW HER OVER THE ABBEY THE PROPOSAL WAS HIS OWN
89-219-0031 NEITHER HER FATHER NOR MISTER ALLEN DID SO IT WAS CERTAINLY VERY PROVOKING
89-219-0032 IF HENRY HAD BEEN WITH THEM INDEED BUT NOW SHE SHOULD NOT KNOW WHAT WAS PICTURESQUE WHEN SHE SAW IT SUCH WERE HER THOUGHTS BUT SHE KEPT THEM TO HERSELF AND PUT ON HER BONNET IN PATIENT DISCONTENT SHE WAS STRUCK HOWEVER BEYOND HER EXPECTATION BY THE GRANDEUR OF THE ABBEY
89-219-0033 AS SHE SAW IT FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM THE LAWN THE WHOLE BUILDING ENCLOSED A LARGE COURT AND TWO SIDES OF THE QUADRANGLE RICH IN GOTHIC ORNAMENTS STOOD FORWARD FOR ADMIRATION THE REMAINDER WAS SHUT OFF BY KNOLLS OF OLD TREES OR LUXURIANT PLANTATIONS
89-219-0034 AND THE STEEP WOODY HILLS RISING BEHIND TO GIVE IT SHELTER WERE BEAUTIFUL EVEN IN THE LEAFLESS MONTH OF MARCH CATHERINE HAD SEEN NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH IT AND HER FEELINGS OF DELIGHT WERE SO STRONG THAT WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY BETTER AUTHORITY SHE BOLDLY BURST FORTH IN WONDER AND PRAISE
89-219-0035 THE GENERAL LISTENED WITH ASSENTING GRATITUDE AND IT SEEMED AS IF HIS OWN ESTIMATION OF NORTHANGER HAD WAITED UNFIXED TILL THAT HOUR
89-219-0036 AND HE LED THE WAY TO IT ACROSS A SMALL PORTION OF THE PARK THE NUMBER OF ACRES CONTAINED IN THIS GARDEN WAS SUCH AS CATHERINE COULD NOT LISTEN TO WITHOUT DISMAY BEING MORE THAN DOUBLE THE EXTENT OF ALL MISTER ALLEN'S AS WELL AS HER FATHER'S INCLUDING CHURCH YARD AND ORCHARD
89-219-0037 THE WALLS SEEMED COUNTLESS IN NUMBER ENDLESS IN LENGTH A VILLAGE OF HOT HOUSES SEEMED TO ARISE AMONG THEM AND A WHOLE PARISH TO BE AT WORK WITHIN THE ENCLOSURE THE GENERAL WAS FLATTERED BY HER LOOKS OF SURPRISE WHICH TOLD HIM ALMOST AS PLAINLY
89-219-0038 AS HE SOON FORCED HER TO TELL HIM IN WORDS THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY GARDENS AT ALL EQUAL TO THEM BEFORE
89-219-0039 WITHOUT ANY AMBITION OF THAT SORT HIMSELF WITHOUT ANY SOLICITUDE ABOUT IT HE DID BELIEVE THEM TO BE UNRIVALLED IN THE KINGDOM IF HE HAD A HOBBY HORSE IT WAS THAT HE LOVED A GARDEN THOUGH CARELESS ENOUGH IN MOST MATTERS OF EATING HE LOVED GOOD FRUIT
89-219-0040 OR IF HE DID NOT HIS FRIENDS AND CHILDREN DID THERE WERE GREAT VEXATIONS HOWEVER ATTENDING SUCH A GARDEN AS HIS
89-219-0041 WITH A TRIUMPHANT SMILE OF SELF SATISFACTION THE GENERAL WISHED HE COULD DO THE SAME
89-219-0042 BY ITS FALLING SHORT OF HIS PLAN HOW WERE MISTER ALLEN'S SUCCESSION HOUSES WORKED DESCRIBING THE NATURE OF HIS OWN AS THEY ENTERED THEM MISTER ALLEN HAD ONLY ONE SMALL HOT HOUSE WHICH MISSUS ALLEN HAD THE USE OF FOR HER PLANTS IN WINTER AND THERE WAS A FIRE IN IT NOW AND THEN
89-219-0043 HE IS A HAPPY MAN SAID THE GENERAL WITH A LOOK OF VERY HAPPY CONTEMPT HAVING TAKEN HER INTO EVERY DIVISION AND LED HER UNDER EVERY WALL TILL SHE WAS HEARTILY WEARY OF SEEING AND WONDERING
89-219-0044 HE SUFFERED THE GIRLS AT LAST TO SEIZE THE ADVANTAGE OF AN OUTER DOOR AND THEN EXPRESSING HIS WISH TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF SOME RECENT ALTERATIONS ABOUT THE TEA HOUSE PROPOSED IT AS NO UNPLEASANT EXTENSION OF THEIR WALK IF MISS MORLAND WERE NOT TIRED
89-219-0045 BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING ELEANOR WHY DO YOU CHOOSE THAT COLD DAMP PATH TO IT MISS MORLAND WILL GET WET OUR BEST WAY IS ACROSS THE PARK
89-219-0046 SAID MISS TILNEY THAT I ALWAYS THINK IT THE BEST AND NEAREST WAY
89-219-0047 IT WAS A NARROW WINDING PATH THROUGH A THICK GROVE OF OLD SCOTCH FIRS AND CATHERINE STRUCK BY ITS GLOOMY ASPECT AND EAGER TO ENTER IT COULD NOT EVEN BY THE GENERAL'S DISAPPROBATION BE KEPT FROM STEPPING FORWARD
89-219-0048 HE PERCEIVED HER INCLINATION AND HAVING AGAIN URGED THE PLEA OF HEALTH IN VAIN WAS TOO POLITE TO MAKE FURTHER OPPOSITION HE EXCUSED HIMSELF HOWEVER FROM ATTENDING THEM THE RAYS OF THE SUN WERE NOT TOO CHEERFUL FOR HIM AND HE WOULD MEET THEM BY ANOTHER COURSE HE TURNED AWAY
89-219-0049 AND CATHERINE WAS SHOCKED TO FIND HOW MUCH HER SPIRITS WERE RELIEVED BY THE SEPARATION
89-219-0050 OFFERED IT NO INJURY AND SHE BEGAN TO TALK WITH EASY GAIETY OF THE DELIGHTFUL MELANCHOLY WHICH SUCH A GROVE INSPIRED I AM PARTICULARLY FOND OF THIS SPOT SAID HER COMPANION WITH A SIGH IT WAS MY MOTHER'S FAVOURITE WALK
89-219-0051 CATHERINE HAD NEVER HEARD MISSUS TILNEY MENTIONED IN THE FAMILY BEFORE AND THE INTEREST EXCITED BY THIS TENDER REMEMBRANCE SHOWED ITSELF DIRECTLY IN HER ALTERED COUNTENANCE AND IN THE ATTENTIVE PAUSE WITH WHICH SHE WAITED FOR SOMETHING MORE
89-219-0052 ADDED ELEANOR THOUGH I NEVER LOVED IT THEN AS I HAVE LOVED IT SINCE AT THAT TIME INDEED I USED TO WONDER AT HER CHOICE BUT HER MEMORY ENDEARS IT NOW AND OUGHT IT NOT REFLECTED CATHERINE TO ENDEAR IT TO HER HUSBAND YET THE GENERAL WOULD NOT ENTER IT
89-219-0053 MISS TILNEY CONTINUING SILENT SHE VENTURED TO SAY HER DEATH MUST HAVE BEEN A GREAT AFFLICTION A GREAT AND INCREASING ONE REPLIED THE OTHER IN A LOW VOICE
89-219-0054 I WAS ONLY THIRTEEN WHEN IT HAPPENED AND THOUGH I FELT MY LOSS PERHAPS AS STRONGLY AS ONE SO YOUNG COULD FEEL IT I DID NOT I COULD NOT THEN KNOW WHAT A LOSS IT WAS SHE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN ADDED WITH GREAT FIRMNESS
89-219-0055 A MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN ALWAYS PRESENT A MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN A CONSTANT FRIEND
89-219-0056 WAS SHE A VERY CHARMING WOMAN WAS SHE HANDSOME WAS THERE ANY PICTURE OF HER IN THE ABBEY
89-219-0057 WAS IT FROM DEJECTION OF SPIRITS WERE QUESTIONS NOW EAGERLY POURED FORTH THE FIRST THREE RECEIVED A READY AFFIRMATIVE
89-219-0058 HER PICTURE I SUPPOSE BLUSHING AT THE CONSUMMATE ART OF HER OWN QUESTION HANGS IN YOUR FATHER'S ROOM NO IT WAS INTENDED FOR THE DRAWING ROOM BUT MY FATHER WAS DISSATISFIED WITH THE PAINTING AND FOR SOME TIME IT HAD NO PLACE
89-219-0059 SOON AFTER HER DEATH I OBTAINED IT FOR MY OWN AND HUNG IT IN MY BED CHAMBER
89-219-0060 IT IS VERY LIKE HERE WAS ANOTHER PROOF A PORTRAIT VERY LIKE OF A DEPARTED WIFE NOT VALUED BY THE HUSBAND HE MUST HAVE BEEN DREADFULLY CRUEL TO HER
89-219-0061 IN SPITE OF ALL HIS ATTENTIONS HE HAD PREVIOUSLY EXCITED AND WHAT HAD BEEN TERROR AND DISLIKE BEFORE WAS NOW ABSOLUTE AVERSION YES AVERSION HIS CRUELTY TO SUCH A CHARMING WOMAN MADE HIM ODIOUS TO HER
89-219-0062 SHE HAD OFTEN READ OF SUCH CHARACTERS CHARACTERS WHICH MISTER ALLEN HAD BEEN USED TO CALL UNNATURAL AND OVERDRAWN BUT HERE WAS PROOF POSITIVE OF THE CONTRARY SHE HAD JUST SETTLED THIS POINT WHEN THE END OF THE PATH BROUGHT THEM DIRECTLY UPON THE GENERAL
89-219-0063 AND IN SPITE OF ALL HER VIRTUOUS INDIGNATION SHE FOUND HERSELF AGAIN OBLIGED TO WALK WITH HIM LISTEN TO HIM AND EVEN TO SMILE WHEN HE SMILED BEING NO LONGER ABLE HOWEVER TO RECEIVE PLEASURE FROM THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS SHE SOON BEGAN TO WALK WITH LASSITUDE
89-219-0064 THE GENERAL PERCEIVED IT AND WITH A CONCERN FOR HER HEALTH WHICH SEEMED TO REPROACH HER FOR HER OPINION OF HIM WAS MOST URGENT FOR RETURNING WITH HIS DAUGHTER TO THE HOUSE HE WOULD FOLLOW THEM IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
8975-270782-0000 THIRTEENTH LECTURE THE DREAM ARCHAIC REMNANTS AND INFANTILISM IN THE DREAM LET US REVERT TO OUR CONCLUSION THAT THE DREAM WORK UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE DREAM CENSORSHIP
8975-270782-0001 TRANSFORMS THE LATENT DREAM THOUGHTS INTO SOME OTHER FORM OF EXPRESSION THE LATENT THOUGHTS ARE NO OTHER THAN THE CONSCIOUS THOUGHTS KNOWN TO US IN OUR WAKING HOURS THE NEW MODE OF EXPRESSION IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO US BECAUSE OF ITS MANY SIDED FEATURES
8975-270782-0002 SO WE CALLED THE MODE OF EXPRESSION OF THE DREAM WORK THE ARCHAIC OR REGRESSIVE YOU MAY CONCLUDE THAT AS A RESULT OF THE DEEPER STUDY OF THE DREAM WORK WE GAIN VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE RATHER UNKNOWN BEGINNINGS OF OUR INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT I TRUST THIS WILL BE TRUE
8975-270782-0003 BUT THIS WORK HAS NOT UP TO THE PRESENT TIME BEEN UNDERTAKEN THE ANTIQUITY INTO WHICH THE DREAM WORK CARRIES US BACK IS OF A DOUBLE ASPECT FIRSTLY THE INDIVIDUAL ANTIQUITY CHILDHOOD AND SECONDLY IN SO FAR AS EVERY INDIVIDUAL IN HIS CHILDHOOD
8975-270782-0004 THAT WE SHALL BE ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE WHICH PART OF THE LATENT PSYCHIC PROCEEDING HAS ITS SOURCE IN THE INDIVIDUAL
8975-270782-0005 IN THIS CONNECTION IT APPEARS TO ME FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE SYMBOLIC RELATIONS WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL HAS NEVER LEARNED
8975-270782-0006 HOWEVER THIS IS NOT THE ONLY ARCHAIC CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DREAM YOU PROBABLY ALL KNOW FROM YOUR OWN EXPERIENCES THE PECULIAR AMNESIA THAT IS LOSS OF MEMORY CONCERNING CHILDHOOD I MEAN THE FACT THAT THE FIRST YEARS TO THE FIFTH
8975-270782-0007 THAT OF A GAP IN THE MEMORY IS FAR MORE FREQUENT I BELIEVE WE HAVE NOT LAID ENOUGH STRESS ON THIS FACT THE CHILD IS ABLE TO SPEAK WELL AT THE AGE OF TWO IT SOON SHOWS THAT IT CAN BECOME ADJUSTED TO THE MOST COMPLICATED PSYCHIC SITUATIONS
8975-270782-0008 AND MAKES REMARKS WHICH YEARS LATER ARE RETOLD TO IT BUT WHICH IT HAS ITSELF ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN BESIDES THE MEMORY IN THE EARLY YEARS IS MORE FACILE BECAUSE IT IS LESS BURDENED THAN IN LATER YEARS
8975-270782-0009 NOR IS THERE ANY REASON FOR CONSIDERING THE MEMORY FUNCTION AS A PARTICULARLY HIGH OR DIFFICULT PSYCHIC PERFORMANCE IN FACT THE CONTRARY IS TRUE AND YOU CAN FIND A GOOD MEMORY IN PERSONS WHO STAND VERY LOW INTELLECTUALLY
8975-270782-0010 I MUST POINT OUT THAT CERTAIN WELL PRESERVED MEMORIES FOR THE MOST PART FORMATIVELY EXPERIENCED STAND FORTH IN THIS MEMORY VOID WHICH SURROUNDS THE FIRST YEARS OF CHILDHOOD AND DO NOT JUSTIFY THIS HYPOTHESIS
8975-270782-0011 OUR MEMORY DEALS SELECTIVELY WITH ITS LATER MATERIALS WITH IMPRESSIONS WHICH COME TO US IN LATER LIFE IT RETAINS THE IMPORTANT AND DISCARDS THE UNIMPORTANT THIS IS NOT TRUE OF THE RETAINED CHILDHOOD MEMORIES
8975-270782-0012 THEY DO NOT BESPEAK NECESSARILY IMPORTANT EXPERIENCES OF CHILDHOOD NOT EVEN SUCH AS FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THE CHILD NEED APPEAR OF IMPORTANCE THEY ARE OFTEN SO BANAL AND INTRINSICALLY SO MEANINGLESS THAT WE ASK OURSELVES IN WONDER WHY JUST THESE DETAILS
8975-270782-0013 HAVE ESCAPED BEING FORGOTTEN I ONCE ENDEAVORED TO APPROACH THE RIDDLE OF CHILDHOOD AMNESIA AND THE INTERRUPTED MEMORY REMNANTS WITH THE HELP OF ANALYSIS AND I ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT IN THE CASE OF THE CHILD TOO
8975-270782-0014 BY MEANS OF CAREFUL ANALYSIS ONE IS ABLE TO DEVELOP OUT OF THEM EVERYTHING THAT IS FORGOTTEN
8975-270782-0015 AND IN SO FAR AS THE CURE IS TO ANY DEGREE SUCCESSFUL WE ARE ABLE AGAIN TO BRING TO LIGHT THE CONTENT OF THE CHILDHOOD YEARS THUS CLOUDED IN FORGETFULNESS THESE IMPRESSIONS HAVE NEVER REALLY BEEN FORGOTTEN THEY HAVE ONLY BEEN INACCESSIBLE LATENT
8975-270782-0016 HAVE BELONGED TO THE UNCONSCIOUS BUT SOMETIMES THEY BOB UP OUT OF THE UNCONSCIOUS SPONTANEOUSLY AND AS A MATTER OF FACT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN DREAMS IT IS APPARENT THAT THE DREAM LIFE KNOWS HOW TO FIND THE ENTRANCE TO THESE LATENT
8975-270782-0017 BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLES OF THIS OCCUR IN LITERATURE AND I MYSELF CAN PRESENT SUCH AN EXAMPLE I ONCE DREAMED IN A CERTAIN CONNECTION OF A PERSON WHO MUST HAVE PERFORMED SOME SERVICE FOR ME AND WHOM I CLEARLY SAW HE WAS A ONE EYED MAN SHORT IN STATURE STOUT
8975-270782-0018 HIS HEAD DEEPLY SUNK INTO HIS NECK I CONCLUDED FROM THE CONTENT THAT HE WAS A PHYSICIAN LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO ASK MY MOTHER WHO WAS STILL LIVING HOW THE PHYSICIAN IN MY BIRTH PLACE WHICH I LEFT WHEN I WAS THREE YEARS OLD LOOKED
8975-270782-0019 AND I LEARNED FROM HER THAT HE HAD ONE EYE WAS SHORT AND STOUT WITH HIS HEAD SUNK INTO HIS NECK AND ALSO LEARNED AT WHAT FORGOTTEN MISHAP HE HAD BEEN OF SERVICE TO ME THIS CONTROL OVER THE FORGOTTEN MATERIAL OF CHILDHOOD YEARS
8975-270782-0020 IS THEN A FURTHER ARCHAIC TENDENCY OF THE DREAM THE SAME INFORMATION MAY BE MADE USE OF IN ANOTHER OF THE PUZZLES THAT HAVE PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO US YOU WILL RECALL HOW ASTONISHED PEOPLE WERE
8975-270782-0021 WHEN WE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE STIMULI WHICH GAVE RISE TO DREAMS WERE EXTREMELY BAD AND LICENTIOUS SEXUAL DESIRES WHICH HAVE MADE DREAM CENSORSHIP AND DREAM DISTORTION NECESSARY AFTER WE HAVE INTERPRETED SUCH A DREAM FOR THE DREAMER AND HE
8975-270782-0022 IN THE MOST FAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES DOES NOT ATTACK THE INTERPRETATION ITSELF HE ALMOST ALWAYS ASKS THE QUESTION WHENCE SUCH A WISH COMES
8975-270782-0023 WE NEED NOT HESITATE TO POINT OUT THIS ORIGIN THESE EVIL WISH IMPULSES HAVE THEIR ORIGIN IN THE PAST OFTEN IN A PAST WHICH IS NOT TOO FAR AWAY
8975-270782-0024 THE WOMAN WHOSE DREAM IS INTERPRETED TO MEAN THAT SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE HER SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER DEAD DISCOVERS UNDER OUR GUIDANCE THAT SHE IN FACT AT ONE TIME ENTERTAINED THIS WISH
8975-270782-0025 WHICH EARLY ENDED IN A SEPARATION
8975-270782-0026 SHE BEAT HER BODY WITH HER FISTS IN A FIT OF ANGER IN ORDER TO KILL THE CHILD HOW MANY MOTHERS WHO TO DAY LOVE THEIR CHILDREN TENDERLY PERHAPS TOO TENDERLY RECEIVED THEM UNWILLINGLY AND AT THE TIME WISHED THAT THE LIFE WITHIN THEM WOULD NOT DEVELOP FURTHER
8975-270782-0027 INDEED TRANSLATED THIS WISH INTO VARIOUS ACTIONS HAPPILY HARMLESS THE LATER DEATH WISH AGAINST SOME LOVED ONE WHICH SEEMS SO STRANGE ALSO HAS ITS ORIGIN IN EARLY PHASES OF THE RELATIONSHIP TO THAT PERSON
8975-270782-0028 THIS WISH WAS NO STRANGER TO HIM WHILE THE CHILD WAS STILL A SUCKLING THIS MAN WHO WAS UNHAPPY IN HIS CHOICE OF A WIFE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT IF THE LITTLE BEING THAT MEANT NOTHING TO HIM WOULD DIE HE WOULD AGAIN BE FREE AND WOULD MAKE BETTER USE OF HIS FREEDOM
8975-270782-0029 THAT SUCH WISHES AND SUCH DREAMS CANNOT OCCUR
8975-270782-0030 ONLY WISH TO WARN YOU THAT YOU ARE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION NOT THE EXACT TERMS OF THE DREAM BUT THE MEANING THEREOF ACCORDING TO ITS INTERPRETATION IT MAY HAPPEN THAT THE MANIFEST DREAM OF THE DEATH OF SOME LOVED PERSON HAS ONLY MADE USE OF SOME FRIGHTFUL MASK
8975-270782-0031 THAT IT REALLY MEANS SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT OR THAT THE LOVED PERSON SERVES AS A CONCEALING SUBSTITUTE FOR SOME OTHER BUT THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES WILL CALL FORTH ANOTHER MORE DIFFICULT QUESTION YOU SAY GRANTED THIS DEATH WISH WAS PRESENT AT SOME TIME OR OTHER
8975-270782-0032 AND IS SUBSTANTIATED BY MEMORY YET THIS IS NO EXPLANATION IT IS LONG OUTLIVED TO DAY IT CAN BE PRESENT ONLY IN THE UNCONSCIOUS AND AS AN EMPTY EMOTIONLESS MEMORY BUT NOT AS A STRONG IMPULSE WHY SHOULD IT BE RECALLED BY THE DREAM AT ALL THIS QUESTION IS JUSTIFIED
8975-270782-0033 IN ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT POINTS OF DREAM STUDY BUT I MUST REMAIN WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF OUR DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE RESTRAINT PREPARE YOURSELVES FOR THE TEMPORARY ABSTENTION LET US BE SATISFIED WITH THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL PROOF
8975-270782-0034 THAT THIS OUTLIVED WISH CAN BE SHOWN TO ACT AS A DREAM STIMULATOR AND LET US CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT OTHER EVIL WISHES ADMIT OF THE SAME DERIVATION OUT OF THE PAST LET US CONTINUE WITH THE REMOVAL OR DEATH WISH
8975-270782-0035 WHICH MOST FREQUENTLY CAN BE TRACED BACK TO THE UNBOUNDED EGOISM OF THE DREAMER
8975-270782-0036 AS OFTEN AS SOMEONE HAS BEEN IN OUR WAY IN LIFE AND HOW OFTEN MUST THIS HAPPEN IN THE COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIPS OF LIFE THE DREAM IS READY TO DO AWAY WITH HIM BE HE FATHER MOTHER BROTHER SISTER SPOUSE ET CETERA
8975-270782-0037 WE HAVE WONDERED SUFFICIENTLY OVER THIS EVIL TENDENCY OF HUMAN NATURE AND CERTAINLY WERE NOT PREDISPOSED TO ACCEPT THE AUTHENTICITY OF THIS RESULT OF DREAM INTERPRETATION WITHOUT QUESTION AFTER IT HAS ONCE BEEN SUGGESTED TO US TO SEEK THE ORIGIN OF SUCH WISHES IN THE PAST
8975-270782-0038 OR REAL REMNANTS THEREOF SHOW THEMSELVES FOR THE CHILD LOVES ITSELF FIRST AND LATER LEARNS TO LOVE OTHERS TO SACRIFICE SOMETHING OF ITS EGO FOR ANOTHER
8975-270782-0039 EVEN THOSE PERSONS WHOM THE CHILD SEEMS TO LOVE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING IT LOVES AT THE OUTSET BECAUSE IT HAS NEED OF THEM CANNOT DO WITHOUT THEM IN OTHERS WORDS OUT OF EGOISTICAL MOTIVES
8975-270782-0040 NOT UNTIL LATER DOES THE LOVE IMPULSE BECOME INDEPENDENT OF EGOISM IN BRIEF EGOISM HAS TAUGHT THE CHILD TO LOVE IN THIS CONNECTION IT IS INSTRUCTIVE TO COMPARE THE CHILD'S REGARD
8975-270782-0041 FOR HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS WITH THAT WHICH HE HAS FOR HIS PARENTS
8975-270782-0042 OFTEN ENOUGH THIS ATTITUDE IS SUPERSEDED BY A MORE TENDER FEELING OR RATHER LET US SAY GLOSSED OVER BUT THE HOSTILE FEELING APPEARS REGULARLY TO HAVE BEEN THE EARLIER IT IS MOST NOTICEABLE IN CHILDREN OF FROM TWO AND ONE HALF
8975-270782-0043 TO FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OF AGE WHEN A NEW LITTLE BROTHER OR SISTER ARRIVES THE LATTER IS USUALLY RECEIVED IN A FAR FROM FRIENDLY MANNER EXPRESSIONS SUCH AS I DON'T WANT HIM LET THE STORK TAKE HIM AWAY AGAIN ARE VERY USUAL
8975-270782-0044 SUBSEQUENTLY EVERY OPPORTUNITY IS MADE USE OF TO DISPARAGE THE NEW ARRIVAL AND EVEN ATTEMPTS TO DO HIM BODILY HARM DIRECT ATTACKS ARE NOT UNHEARD OF
8975-270782-0045 IF THE DIFFERENCE IN AGE IS LESS THE CHILD LEARNS OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE RIVAL WITH INTENSE PSYCHIC ACTIVITY AND ACCOMMODATES HIMSELF TO THE NEW SITUATION IF THE DIFFERENCE IN AGE IS GREATER THE NEW CHILD MAY AWAKEN CERTAIN SYMPATHIES AS AN
8975-270782-0046 INTERESTING OBJECT AS A SORT OF LIVING DOLL AND IF THE DIFFERENCE IS EIGHT YEARS OR MORE MOTHERLY IMPULSES ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF GIRLS MAY COME INTO PLAY BUT TO BE TRUTHFUL WHEN WE DISCLOSE IN A DREAM THE WISH FOR THE DEATH OF A MOTHER OR SISTER
8975-270782-0047 WE NEED SELDOM FIND IT PUZZLING AND MAY TRACE ITS ORIGIN EASILY TO EARLY CHILDHOOD OFTEN ENOUGH ALSO TO THE PROPINQUITY OF LATER YEARS PROBABLY NO NURSERIES ARE FREE FROM MIGHTY CONFLICTS AMONG THE INHABITANTS
8975-270782-0048 THE MOTIVES ARE RIVALRY FOR THE LOVE OF THE PARENTS ARTICLES OWNED IN COMMON THE ROOM ITSELF THE HOSTILE IMPULSES ARE CALLED FORTH BY OLDER AS WELL AS YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS
8975-270782-0049 IF THERE IS ANYONE WHO HATES A YOUNG ENGLISH LADY MORE THAN DOES HER MOTHER IT IS HER ELDER SISTER THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SAYING HOWEVER THAT AROUSES OUR ANTIPATHY WE CAN AT A PINCH UNDERSTAND HATRED OF BROTHERS AND SISTERS
8975-270782-0050 AND RIVALRY AMONG THEM BUT HOW MAY FEELINGS OF HATRED FORCE THEIR WAY INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DAUGHTER AND MOTHER PARENTS AND CHILDREN THIS RELATIONSHIP IS WITHOUT DOUBT THE MORE FAVORABLE EVEN WHEN LOOKED AT FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THE CHILD
8975-270782-0051 THIS IS IN ACCORD WITH OUR EXPECTATION WE FIND IT MUCH MORE OFFENSIVE FOR LOVE BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN TO BE LACKING THAN FOR LOVE BETWEEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS WE HAVE SO TO SPEAK MADE SOMETHING HOLY IN THE FIRST INSTANCE
8975-270782-0052 WHICH IN THE OTHER CASE WE PERMITTED TO REMAIN PROFANE
8975-270782-0053 THE FEELINGS BETWEEN PARENTS AND THEIR GROWN CHILDREN FAIL TO COME UP TO THE IDEAL ESTABLISHED BY SOCIETY HOW MUCH ENMITY EXISTS AND WOULD FIND EXPRESSION DID NOT ACCUMULATIONS OF PIETY AND OF TENDER IMPULSE HOLD THEM BACK THE MOTIVES FOR THIS ARE EVERYWHERE KNOWN
8975-270782-0054 AND DISCLOSE A TENDENCY TO SEPARATE THOSE OF THE SAME SEX DAUGHTER FROM MOTHER FATHER FROM SON THE DAUGHTER FINDS IN HER MOTHER THE AUTHORITY THAT HEMS IN HER WILL AND THAT IS ENTRUSTED WITH THE TASK OF CAUSING HER TO CARRY OUT
8975-270782-0055 THE ABSTENTION FROM SEXUAL LIBERTY WHICH SOCIETY DEMANDS IN CERTAIN CASES ALSO SHE IS THE RIVAL WHO OBJECTS TO BEING DISPLACED THE SAME TYPE OF THING OCCURS IN A MORE GLARING MANNER BETWEEN FATHER AND SON
8975-270782-0056 TO THE SON THE FATHER IS THE EMBODIMENT OF EVERY SOCIAL RESTRICTION BORNE WITH SUCH GREAT OPPOSITION THE FATHER BARS THE WAY TO FREEDOM OF WILL TO EARLY SEXUAL SATISFACTION
8975-270782-0057 TO THE ENJOYMENT THEREOF IMPATIENT WAITING FOR THE DEATH OF THE FATHER GROWS TO HEIGHTS APPROXIMATING TRAGEDY IN THE CASE OF A SUCCESSOR TO THE THRONE LESS STRAINED IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FATHER AND DAUGHTER MOTHER AND SON
8975-270782-0058 THE LATTER AFFORDS THE PUREST EXAMPLES OF AN UNALTERABLE TENDERNESS IN NO WAY DISTURBED BY EGOISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS WHY DO I SPEAK OF THESE THINGS SO BANAL AND SO WELL KNOWN
8975-270782-0059 BECAUSE THERE IS AN UNMISTAKABLE DISPOSITION TO DENY THEIR SIGNIFICANCE IN LIFE AND TO SET FORTH THE IDEAL DEMANDED BY SOCIETY AS A FULFILLED THING MUCH OFTENER THAN IT REALLY IS FULFILLED BUT IT IS PREFERABLE FOR PSYCHOLOGY TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
8975-270782-0060 RATHER THAN THAT THIS TASK SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE CYNIC IN ANY EVENT THIS DENIAL REFERS ONLY TO ACTUAL LIFE THE ARTS OF NARRATIVE AND DRAMATIC POETRY ARE STILL FREE TO MAKE USE OF THE MOTIVES THAT RESULT FROM A DISTURBANCE OF THIS IDEAL
8975-270782-0061 IT IS NOT TO BE WONDERED AT THAT IN THE CASE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE DREAM DISCLOSES THE WISH FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE PARENTS ESPECIALLY THE PARENT OF THE SAME SEX WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT IT IS ALSO PRESENT DURING WAKING HOURS
8975-270782-0062 AS IN THE CASE OF THE DREAMER'S SYMPATHY FOR HIS FATHER'S UNNECESSARY SUFFERINGS IN EXAMPLE THREE IT IS SELDOM THAT THE ENMITY ALONE CONTROLS THE RELATIONSHIP MUCH MORE OFTEN IT RECEDES BEHIND MORE TENDER IMPULSES
8975-270782-0063 BY WHICH IT IS SUPPRESSED AND MUST WAIT UNTIL A DREAM ISOLATES IT THAT WHICH THE DREAM SHOWS US IN ENLARGED FORM AS A RESULT OF SUCH ISOLATION SHRINKS TOGETHER AGAIN AFTER IT HAS BEEN PROPERLY DOCKETED IN ITS RELATION TO LIFE AS A RESULT OF OUR INTERPRETATION
8975-270782-0064 H SACHS BUT WE ALSO FIND THIS DREAM WISH IN PLACES WHERE IT HAS NO CONNECTION WITH LIFE AND WHERE THE ADULT IN HIS WAKING HOURS WOULD NEVER RECOGNIZE IT THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THE DEEPEST AND MOST UNIFORM MOTIVE FOR BECOMING UNFRIENDLY
8975-270782-0065 ESPECIALLY BETWEEN PERSONS OF THE SAME SEX HAS ALREADY MADE ITS INFLUENCE FELT IN EARLIEST CHILDHOOD I MEAN THE LOVE RIVALRY WITH THE ESPECIAL EMPHASIS OF THE SEX CHARACTER THE SON EVEN AS A SMALL CHILD
8975-270782-0066 WHO IS A DISTURBING ELEMENT IN HER TENDER RELATIONSHIP WITH HER FATHER AND WHO OCCUPIES A POSITION THAT SHE COULD VERY WELL FILL HERSELF ONE LEARNS FROM THESE OBSERVATIONS TO WHAT EARLY YEARS THESE IDEAS EXTEND BACK
8975-270782-0067 IDEAS WHICH WE DESIGNATE AS THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX BECAUSE THIS MYTH REALIZES WITH A VERY SLIGHTLY WEAKENED EFFECT THE TWO EXTREME WISHES WHICH GROW OUT OF THE SITUATION OF THE SON TO KILL HIS FATHER AND TAKE HIS MOTHER TO WIFE
8975-270782-0068 I DO NOT WISH TO MAINTAIN THAT THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX COVERS ENTIRELY THE RELATION OF THE CHILD TO ITS PARENTS THIS RELATION CAN BE MUCH MORE COMPLICATED FURTHERMORE THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX IS MORE OR LESS WELL DEVELOPED IT MAY EVEN EXPERIENCE A REVERSAL
8975-270782-0069 BUT IT IS A CUSTOMARY AND VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE PSYCHIC LIFE OF THE CHILD AND ONE TENDS RATHER TO UNDERESTIMATE THAN TO OVERESTIMATE ITS INFLUENCE AND THE DEVELOPMENTS WHICH MAY FOLLOW FROM IT IN ADDITION
8975-270782-0070 CHILDREN FREQUENTLY REACT TO THE OEDIPUS IDEA THROUGH STIMULATION BY THE PARENTS WHO IN THE PLACING OF THEIR AFFECTION ARE OFTEN LED BY SEX DIFFERENCES SO THAT THE FATHER PREFERS THE DAUGHTER THE MOTHER THE SON
8975-270782-0071 AND THIS LOVE IS SUBSTITUTED FOR THE OUTWORN LOVE ONE CANNOT MAINTAIN THAT THE WORLD WAS VERY GRATEFUL TO PSYCHOANALYTIC RESEARCH FOR ITS DISCOVERY OF THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX ON THE CONTRARY IT CALLED FORTH THE STRONGEST RESISTANCE ON THE PART OF ADULTS
8975-270782-0072 AND PERSONS WHO HAD NEGLECTED TO TAKE PART IN DENYING THIS PROSCRIBED OR TABOOED FEELING RELATIONSHIP LATER MADE GOOD THE OMISSION BY TAKING ALL VALUE FROM THE COMPLEX THROUGH FALSE INTERPRETATIONS ACCORDING TO MY UNCHANGED CONVICTION
8975-270782-0073 CAST OUT OF LIFE WAS YIELDED UP TO POETRY AND GIVEN THE FREEST PLAY O RANK HAS SHOWN IN A CAREFUL STUDY HOW THIS VERY OEDIPUS COMPLEX HAS SUPPLIED DRAMATIC LITERATURE
8975-270782-0074 WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF MOTIVES IN UNENDING VARIATIONS DERIVATIONS AND DISGUISES ALSO IN DISTORTED FORMS SUCH AS WE RECOGNIZE TO BE THE WORK OF A CENSOR WE MAY ALSO ASCRIBE THIS OEDIPUS COMPLEX TO THOSE DREAMERS
8975-270782-0075 WHO WERE SO FORTUNATE AS TO ESCAPE IN LATER LIFE THESE CONFLICTS WITH THEIR PARENTS AND INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED THEREWITH WE FIND WHAT WE CALL THE CASTRATION COMPLEX THE REACTION TO SEXUAL INTIMIDATION OR RESTRICTION ASCRIBED TO THE FATHER
8975-270782-0076 BY APPLYING OUR FORMER RESEARCHES TO THE STUDY OF THE PSYCHIC LIFE OF THE CHILD WE MAY EXPECT TO FIND THAT THE ORIGIN OF OTHER FORBIDDEN DREAM WISHES OF EXCESSIVE SEXUAL IMPULSES MAY BE EXPLAINED IN THE SAME MANNER
8975-270782-0077 THUS WE ARE MOVED TO STUDY THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEX LIFE IN THE CHILD ALSO AND WE DISCOVER THE FOLLOWING FROM A NUMBER OF SOURCES IN THE FIRST PLACE IT IS A MISTAKE TO DENY THAT THE CHILD HAS A SEXUAL LIFE AND TO TAKE IT FOR GRANTED
8975-270782-0078 THAT SEXUALITY COMMENCES WITH THE RIPENING OF THE GENITALS AT THE TIME OF PUBERTY ON THE CONTRARY THE CHILD HAS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING A SEXUAL LIFE RICH IN CONTENT AND DIFFERING IN NUMEROUS RESPECTS
8975-270782-0079 WHAT WE CALL PERVERSE IN THE LIFE OF THE ADULT DIFFERS FROM THE NORMAL IN THE FOLLOWING RESPECTS FIRST IN DISREGARD FOR THE DIVIDING LINE OF SPECIES THE GULF BETWEEN MAN AND ANIMAL SECOND
8975-270782-0080 BEING INSENSIBLE TO THE CONVENTIONAL FEELING OF DISGUST THIRD THE INCEST LIMITATION BEING PROHIBITED FROM SEEKING SEXUAL SATISFACTION WITH NEAR BLOOD RELATIONS FOURTH HOMOSEXUALITY AND FIFTH
8975-270782-0081 HE KNOWS NO UNBRIDGABLE CHASM BETWEEN MAN AND ANIMAL THE ARROGANCE WITH WHICH MAN DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF FROM THE ANIMAL IS A LATER ACQUISITION IN THE BEGINNING HE IS NOT DISGUSTED AT THE SIGHT OF EXCREMENT BUT SLOWLY LEARNS TO BE SO DISGUSTED
8975-270782-0082 UNDER THE PRESSURE OF EDUCATION HE LAYS NO SPECIAL STRESS ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SEXES RATHER ACCREDITS TO BOTH THE SAME GENITAL FORMATION
8975-270782-0083 TOWARD THOSE PERSONS CLOSEST TO HIM AND WHO ARE DEAR TO HIM FOR VARIOUS REASONS HIS PARENTS BROTHERS AND SISTERS NURSES AND FINALLY YOU MAY OBSERVE IN HIM THAT WHICH LATER BREAKS THROUGH AGAIN RAISED NOW TO A LOVE ATTRACTION
8975-270782-0084 POLYMORPHUS PERVERSE AND IF HE MAKES BUT SLIGHT USE OF ALL THESE IMPULSES IT IS ON THE ONE HAND BECAUSE OF THEIR LESSER INTENSITY AS COMPARED TO LATER LIFE AND ON THE OTHER HAND
8975-270782-0085 AND TO DISGUISE ANOTHER PART BY MISREPRESENTING ITS SEXUAL NATURE UNTIL THEY CAN DENY THE WHOLE BUSINESS THESE ARE OFTEN THE SAME PERSONS WHO DISCOURSE VIOLENTLY AGAINST ALL THE SEXUAL FAULTS OF THE CHILD
8975-270782-0086 AND THEN AT THE WRITING TABLE DEFEND THE SEXUAL PURITY OF THE SAME CHILDREN WHERE CHILDREN ARE LEFT TO THEMSELVES OR ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CORRUPTION
8975-270782-0087 OF PERVERSE SEXUAL ACTIVITY TO BE SURE THE GROWN UPS ARE RIGHT IN LOOKING UPON THESE THINGS AS CHILDISH PERFORMANCES AS PLAY FOR THE CHILD IS NOT TO BE JUDGED AS MATURE AND ANSWERABLE EITHER BEFORE THE BAR OF CUSTOM OR BEFORE THE LAW
8975-270782-0088 BUT THESE THINGS DO EXIST THEY HAVE THEIR SIGNIFICANCE AS INDICATIONS OF INNATE CHARACTERISTICS AS WELL AS CAUSES AND FURTHERANCES OF LATER DEVELOPMENTS THEY GIVE US AN INSIGHT INTO CHILDHOOD SEX LIFE AND THEREBY INTO THE SEX LIFE OF MAN
8975-270782-0089 WHEN WE REDISCOVER IN THE BACKGROUND OF OUR DISTORTED DREAMS ALL THESE PERVERSE WISH IMPULSES IT MEANS ONLY THAT THE DREAM HAS IN THIS FIELD
8975-270782-0090 THOSE DIRECTED TOWARDS SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH PARENTS AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS YOU KNOW WHAT ANTIPATHY SOCIETY FEELS TOWARD SUCH INTERCOURSE OR AT LEAST PRETENDS TO FEEL AND WHAT WEIGHT IS LAID ON THE PROHIBITIONS DIRECTED AGAINST IT
8975-270782-0091 THE MOST MONSTROUS EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO EXPLAIN THIS FEAR OF INCEST SOME HAVE BELIEVED THAT IT IS DUE TO EVOLUTIONARY FORESIGHT ON THE PART OF NATURE WHICH IS PSYCHICALLY REPRESENTED BY THIS PROHIBITION BECAUSE INBREEDING WOULD DETERIORATE THE RACE CHARACTER
8975-270782-0092 OTHERS MAINTAINED THAT BECAUSE OF HAVING LIVED TOGETHER SINCE EARLY CHILDHOOD THE SEXUAL DESIRE IS DIVERTED FROM THE PERSONS UNDER CONSIDERATION IN BOTH CASES FURTHERMORE THE INCEST AVOIDANCE WOULD BE AUTOMATICALLY ASSURED
8975-270782-0093 AND MOST CUSTOMARY CHOICE AND THAT NOT UNTIL LATER IS THERE ANY RESISTANCE THE SOURCE OF WHICH PROBABLY IS TO BE FOUND IN THE INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGY
8975-270782-0094 TOWARD THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE DREAM WE FOUND NOT ONLY THAT THE MATERIALS OF FORGOTTEN CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES ARE ACCESSIBLE TO THE DREAM
8975-270782-0095 WITH ALL ITS PECULIARITIES ITS EGOISM ITS INCESTUOUS LOVE CHOICE ET CETERA CONTINUES FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE DREAM IN THE UNCONSCIOUS
8975-270782-0096 INFANTILE SIDE OF PSYCHIC LIFE WHICH WE MAY FIND IN ACTION IN CHILDREN WHICH WE OVERLOOK PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE SLIGHTNESS OF ITS DIMENSIONS PARTLY BECAUSE IT IS LIGHTLY CONSIDERED SINCE WE DEMAND NO ETHICAL HEIGHTS OF THE CHILD
8975-270782-0097 SINCE THE DREAM REGRESSES TO THIS STAGE IT SEEMS TO HAVE MADE APPARENT THE EVIL THAT LIES IN US BUT IT IS ONLY A DECEPTIVE APPEARANCE BY WHICH WE HAVE ALLOWED OURSELVES TO BE FRIGHTENED WE ARE NOT SO EVIL AS WE MIGHT SUSPECT FROM THE INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS
8975-270782-0098 IF THE EVIL IMPULSES OF THE DREAM ARE MERELY INFANTILISM A RETURN TO THE BEGINNINGS OF OUR ETHICAL DEVELOPMENT SINCE THE DREAM SIMPLY MAKES CHILDREN OF US AGAIN IN THINKING AND IN FEELING WE NEED NOT BE ASHAMED OF THESE EVIL DREAMS IF WE ARE REASONABLE
8975-270782-0099 BUT BEING REASONABLE IS ONLY A PART OF PSYCHIC LIFE MANY THINGS ARE TAKING PLACE THERE THAT ARE NOT REASONABLE AND SO IT HAPPENS THAT WE ARE ASHAMED OF SUCH DREAMS AND UNREASONABLY WE TURN THEM OVER TO THE DREAM CENSORSHIP
8975-270782-0100 ARE ASHAMED AND ANGRY IF ONE OF THESE DREAMS HAS IN SOME UNUSUAL MANNER SUCCEEDED IN PENETRATING INTO CONSCIOUSNESS IN AN UNDISTORTED FORM
8975-270782-0101 AS WE WOULD BE IF WE UNDERSTOOD IT JUST THINK OF THE SCANDALIZED OPINION OF THE FINE OLD LADY ABOUT HER UNINTERPRETED DREAM OF SERVICES OF LOVE THE PROBLEM IS NOT YET SOLVED
8975-270782-0102 AND IT IS STILL POSSIBLE THAT UPON FURTHER STUDY OF THE EVIL IN THE DREAM WE SHALL COME TO SOME OTHER DECISION AND ARRIVE AT ANOTHER VALUATION OF HUMAN NATURE AS A RESULT OF THE WHOLE INVESTIGATION WE GRASP TWO FACTS
8975-270782-0103 WHICH HOWEVER DISCLOSE ONLY THE BEGINNINGS OF NEW RIDDLES NEW DOUBTS FIRST THE REGRESSION OF DREAM WORK IS NOT ONLY FORMAL IT IS ALSO OF GREATER IMPORT IT NOT ONLY TRANSLATES OUR THOUGHTS INTO A PRIMITIVE FORM OF EXPRESSION
8975-270782-0104 BUT IT REAWAKENS THE PECULIARITIES OF OUR PRIMITIVE PSYCHIC LIFE THE ANCIENT PREDOMINANCE OF THE EGO THE EARLIEST IMPULSES OF OUR SEXUAL LIFE EVEN OUR OLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
8975-270782-0105 UNCONSCIOUS IS NO LONGER A NAME FOR WHAT IS AT THAT TIME LATENT THE UNCONSCIOUS IS AN ESPECIAL PSYCHIC REALM WITH WISH IMPULSES OF ITS OWN WITH ITS OWN METHOD OF EXPRESSION AND WITH A PSYCHIC MECHANISM PECULIAR TO ITSELF
8975-270782-0106 BUT THE LATENT DREAM THOUGHTS WHICH WE HAVE SOLVED BY MEANS OF THE DREAM INTERPRETATION ARE NOT OF THIS REALM THEY ARE MUCH MORE NEARLY THE SAME AS ANY WE MAY HAVE THOUGHT IN OUR WAKING HOURS STILL THEY ARE UNCONSCIOUS
8975-270782-0107 HOW DOES ONE SOLVE THIS CONTRADICTION WE BEGIN TO SEE THAT A DISTINCTION MUST BE MADE SOMETHING THAT ORIGINATES IN OUR CONSCIOUS LIFE AND THAT SHARES ITS CHARACTERISTICS
8975-270782-0108 THE DAY REMNANTS COMBINES IN THE DREAM FABRICATION
8975-270782-0109 BETWEEN THESE TWO PARTS THE DREAM WORK COMPLETES ITSELF THE INFLUENCING OF THE DAY REMNANTS BY THE UNCONSCIOUS NECESSITATES REGRESSION THIS IS THE DEEPEST INSIGHT INTO THE NATURE OF THE DREAM
8975-270782-0110 THAT WE ARE ABLE TO ATTAIN WITHOUT HAVING SEARCHED THROUGH FURTHER PSYCHIC REALMS THE TIME WILL SOON COME HOWEVER WHEN WE SHALL CLOTHE THE UNCONSCIOUS CHARACTER OF THE LATENT DREAM THOUGHT WITH ANOTHER NAME
8975-270782-0111 WHICH SHALL DIFFERENTIATE IT FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS OUT OF THE REALM OF THE INFANTILE WE MAY TO BE SURE PROPOUND THE QUESTION WHAT FORCES THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ACTIVITY DURING SLEEP TO SUCH REGRESSION
8975-270782-0112 WHY DO NOT THE SLEEP DISTURBING PSYCHIC STIMULI DO THE JOB WITHOUT IT AND IF THEY MUST BECAUSE OF THE DREAM CENSORSHIP DISGUISE THEMSELVES THROUGH OLD FORMS OF EXPRESSION WHICH ARE NO LONGER COMPREHENSIBLE
8975-270782-0113 WHAT IS THE USE OF GIVING NEW LIFE TO OLD LONG OUTGROWN PSYCHIC STIMULI WISHES AND CHARACTER TYPES THAT IS WHY THE MATERIAL REGRESSION IN ADDITION TO THE FORMAL THE ONLY SATISFACTORY ANSWER WOULD BE THIS
8975-270782-0114 THAT ONLY IN THIS MANNER CAN A DREAM BE BUILT UP
909-131041-0000 THE MODE OF APPOINTMENT OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE OF THE UNITED STATES IS ALMOST THE ONLY PART OF THE SYSTEM OF ANY CONSEQUENCE WHICH HAS ESCAPED WITHOUT SEVERE CENSURE OR WHICH HAS RECEIVED THE SLIGHTEST MARK OF APPROBATION FROM ITS OPPONENTS
909-131041-0001 THE MOST PLAUSIBLE OF THESE WHO HAS APPEARED IN PRINT
909-131041-0002 AND HESITATE NOT TO AFFIRM THAT IF THE MANNER OF IT BE NOT PERFECT IT IS AT LEAST EXCELLENT
909-131041-0003 BUT TO MEN CHOSEN BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE SPECIAL PURPOSE AND AT THE PARTICULAR CONJUNCTURE IT WAS EQUALLY DESIRABLE THAT THE IMMEDIATE ELECTION SHOULD BE MADE BY MEN MOST CAPABLE OF ANALYZING THE QUALITIES ADAPTED TO THE STATION
909-131041-0004 AND ACTING UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES FAVORABLE TO DELIBERATION AND TO A JUDICIOUS COMBINATION OF ALL THE REASONS AND INDUCEMENTS WHICH WERE PROPER TO GOVERN THEIR CHOICE A SMALL NUMBER OF PERSONS
909-131041-0005 SELECTED BY THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS FROM THE GENERAL MASS WILL BE MOST LIKELY TO POSSESS THE INFORMATION AND DISCERNMENT REQUISITE TO SUCH COMPLICATED INVESTIGATIONS
909-131041-0006 BUT THE PRECAUTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN SO HAPPILY CONCERTED IN THE SYSTEM UNDER CONSIDERATION PROMISE AN EFFECTUAL SECURITY AGAINST THIS MISCHIEF THE CHOICE OF SEVERAL TO FORM AN INTERMEDIATE BODY OF ELECTORS
909-131041-0007 WILL BE MUCH LESS APT TO CONVULSE THE COMMUNITY WITH ANY EXTRAORDINARY OR VIOLENT MOVEMENTS THAN THE CHOICE OF ONE WHO WAS HIMSELF TO BE THE FINAL OBJECT OF THE PUBLIC WISHES AND AS THE ELECTORS CHOSEN IN EACH STATE
909-131041-0008 ARE TO ASSEMBLE AND VOTE IN THE STATE IN WHICH THEY ARE CHOSEN THIS DETACHED AND DIVIDED SITUATION WILL EXPOSE THEM MUCH LESS TO HEATS AND FERMENTS WHICH MIGHT BE COMMUNICATED FROM THEM TO THE PEOPLE THAN IF THEY WERE ALL TO BE CONVENED
909-131041-0009 AT ONE TIME IN ONE PLACE NOTHING WAS MORE TO BE DESIRED THAN THAT EVERY PRACTICABLE OBSTACLE SHOULD BE OPPOSED TO CABAL INTRIGUE AND CORRUPTION
909-131041-0010 THESE MOST DEADLY ADVERSARIES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT MIGHT NATURALLY HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO MAKE THEIR APPROACHES FROM MORE THAN ONE QUARTER BUT CHIEFLY FROM THE DESIRE IN FOREIGN POWERS TO GAIN AN IMPROPER ASCENDANT IN OUR COUNCILS
909-131041-0011 HOW COULD THEY BETTER GRATIFY THIS THAN BY RAISING A CREATURE OF THEIR OWN TO THE CHIEF MAGISTRACY OF THE UNION BUT THE CONVENTION HAVE GUARDED AGAINST ALL DANGER OF THIS SORT WITH THE MOST PROVIDENT AND JUDICIOUS ATTENTION
909-131041-0012 THEY HAVE NOT MADE THE APPOINTMENT OF THE PRESIDENT TO DEPEND ON ANY PREEXISTING BODIES OF MEN WHO MIGHT BE TAMPERED WITH BEFOREHAND TO PROSTITUTE THEIR VOTES BUT THEY HAVE REFERRED IT IN THE FIRST INSTANCE TO AN IMMEDIATE ACT OF THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA
909-131041-0013 TO BE EXERTED IN THE CHOICE OF PERSONS FOR THE TEMPORARY AND SOLE PURPOSE OF MAKING THE APPOINTMENT AND THEY HAVE EXCLUDED FROM ELIGIBILITY TO THIS TRUST ALL THOSE WHO FROM SITUATION MIGHT BE SUSPECTED OF TOO GREAT DEVOTION TO THE PRESIDENT IN OFFICE
909-131041-0014 NO SENATOR REPRESENTATIVE OR OTHER PERSON HOLDING A PLACE OF TRUST OR PROFIT UNDER THE UNITED STATES CAN BE OF THE NUMBERS OF THE ELECTORS THUS WITHOUT CORRUPTING THE BODY OF THE PEOPLE THE IMMEDIATE AGENTS IN THE ELECTION
909-131041-0015 WILL AT LEAST ENTER UPON THE TASK FREE FROM ANY SINISTER BIAS THEIR TRANSIENT EXISTENCE AND THEIR DETACHED SITUATION ALREADY TAKEN NOTICE OF AFFORD A SATISFACTORY PROSPECT OF THEIR CONTINUING SO TO THE CONCLUSION OF IT
909-131041-0016 THE BUSINESS OF CORRUPTION WHEN IT IS TO EMBRACE SO CONSIDERABLE A NUMBER OF MEN REQUIRES TIME AS WELL AS MEANS NOR WOULD IT BE FOUND EASY SUDDENLY TO EMBARK THEM DISPERSED AS THEY WOULD BE OVER THIRTEEN STATES
909-131041-0017 IN ANY COMBINATIONS FOUNDED UPON MOTIVES WHICH THOUGH THEY COULD NOT PROPERLY BE DENOMINATED CORRUPT MIGHT YET BE OF A NATURE TO MISLEAD THEM FROM THEIR DUTY
909-131041-0018 ON ALL BUT THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES
909-131041-0019 THIS ADVANTAGE WILL ALSO BE SECURED BY MAKING HIS RE ELECTION TO DEPEND ON A SPECIAL BODY OF REPRESENTATIVES DEPUTED BY THE SOCIETY FOR THE SINGLE PURPOSE OF MAKING THE IMPORTANT CHOICE ALL THESE ADVANTAGES WILL HAPPILY COMBINE IN THE PLAN DEVISED BY THE CONVENTION
909-131041-0020 WHICH IS THAT THE PEOPLE OF EACH STATE SHALL CHOOSE A NUMBER OF PERSONS AS ELECTORS EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF SUCH STATE IN THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WHO SHALL ASSEMBLE WITHIN THE STATE AND VOTE FOR SOME FIT PERSON AS PRESIDENT
909-131041-0021 AND THE PERSON WHO MAY HAPPEN TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF THE WHOLE NUMBER OF VOTES WILL BE THE PRESIDENT BUT AS A MAJORITY OF THE VOTES MIGHT NOT ALWAYS HAPPEN TO CENTRE IN ONE MAN AND AS IT MIGHT BE UNSAFE TO PERMIT LESS THAN A MAJORITY TO BE CONCLUSIVE
909-131041-0022 IT IS PROVIDED THAT IN SUCH A CONTINGENCY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES SHALL SELECT OUT OF THE CANDIDATES WHO SHALL HAVE THE FIVE HIGHEST NUMBER OF VOTES THE MAN WHO IN THEIR OPINION MAY BE BEST QUALIFIED FOR THE OFFICE
909-131041-0023 THE PROCESS OF ELECTION AFFORDS A MORAL CERTAINTY THAT THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT WILL NEVER FALL TO THE LOT OF ANY MAN WHO IS NOT IN AN EMINENT DEGREE ENDOWED WITH THE REQUISITE QUALIFICATIONS TALENTS FOR LOW INTRIGUE
909-131041-0024 AND THE LITTLE ARTS OF POPULARITY MAY ALONE SUFFICE TO ELEVATE A MAN TO THE FIRST HONORS IN A SINGLE STATE BUT IT WILL REQUIRE OTHER TALENTS AND A DIFFERENT KIND OF MERIT TO ESTABLISH HIM IN THE ESTEEM AND CONFIDENCE OF THE WHOLE UNION
909-131041-0025 OR OF SO CONSIDERABLE A PORTION OF IT AS WOULD BE NECESSARY TO MAKE HIM A SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATE FOR THE DISTINGUISHED OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IT WILL NOT BE TOO STRONG TO SAY THAT THERE WILL BE A CONSTANT PROBABILITY OF SEEING THE STATION FILLED BY CHARACTERS
909-131041-0026 PRE EMINENT FOR ABILITY AND VIRTUE AND THIS WILL BE THOUGHT NO INCONSIDERABLE RECOMMENDATION OF THE CONSTITUTION BY THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE SHARE WHICH THE EXECUTIVE IN EVERY GOVERNMENT MUST NECESSARILY HAVE IN ITS GOOD OR ILL ADMINISTRATION
909-131041-0027 THOUGH WE CANNOT ACQUIESCE IN THE POLITICAL HERESY OF THE POET WHO SAYS FOR FORMS OF GOVERNMENT LET FOOLS CONTEST THAT WHICH IS BEST ADMINISTERED IS BEST YET WE MAY SAFELY PRONOUNCE
909-131041-0028 THAT THE TRUE TEST OF A GOOD GOVERNMENT IS ITS APTITUDE AND TENDENCY TO PRODUCE A GOOD ADMINISTRATION THE VICE PRESIDENT IS TO BE CHOSEN IN THE SAME MANNER WITH THE PRESIDENT WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT THE SENATE IS TO DO IN RESPECT TO THE FORMER
909-131041-0029 WHAT IS TO BE DONE BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN RESPECT TO THE LATTER THE APPOINTMENT OF AN EXTRAORDINARY PERSON AS VICE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN OBJECTED TO AS SUPERFLUOUS IF NOT MISCHIEVOUS
909-131041-0030 THE OTHER CONSIDERATION IS THAT AS THE VICE PRESIDENT MAY OCCASIONALLY BECOME A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE PRESIDENT IN THE SUPREME EXECUTIVE MAGISTRACY ALL THE REASONS WHICH RECOMMEND THE MODE OF ELECTION PRESCRIBED FOR THE ONE
909-131041-0031 APPLY WITH GREAT IF NOT WITH EQUAL FORCE TO THE MANNER OF APPOINTING THE OTHER IT IS REMARKABLE THAT IN THIS AS IN MOST OTHER INSTANCES THE OBJECTION WHICH IS MADE WOULD LIE AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION OF THIS STATE WE HAVE A LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR
909-131044-0000 THE DURATION IN OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE FROM THE NEW YORK PACKET
909-131044-0001 AND TO THE STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN ADOPTED UNDER HIS AUSPICES WITH REGARD TO THE FIRST IT MUST BE EVIDENT THAT THE LONGER THE DURATION IN OFFICE THE GREATER WILL BE THE PROBABILITY OF OBTAINING SO IMPORTANT AN ADVANTAGE
909-131044-0002 IT IS A GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF HUMAN NATURE THAT A MAN WILL BE INTERESTED IN WHATEVER HE POSSESSES IN PROPORTION TO THE FIRMNESS OR PRECARIOUSNESS OF THE TENURE BY WHICH HE HOLDS IT
909-131044-0003 AND OF COURSE WILL BE WILLING TO RISK MORE FOR THE SAKE OF THE ONE THAN FOR THE SAKE OF THE OTHER THIS REMARK IS NOT LESS APPLICABLE TO A POLITICAL PRIVILEGE OR HONOR OR TRUST THAN TO ANY ARTICLE OF ORDINARY PROPERTY
909-131044-0004 THE INFERENCE FROM IT IS THAT A MAN ACTING IN THE CAPACITY OF CHIEF MAGISTRATE UNDER A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IN A VERY SHORT TIME HE MUST LAY DOWN HIS OFFICE WILL BE APT TO FEEL HIMSELF TOO LITTLE INTERESTED IN IT TO HAZARD ANY MATERIAL CENSURE OR PERPLEXITY
909-131044-0005 FROM THE INDEPENDENT EXERTION OF HIS POWERS OR FROM ENCOUNTERING THE ILL HUMORS HOWEVER TRANSIENT WHICH MAY HAPPEN TO PREVAIL EITHER IN A CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE SOCIETY ITSELF OR EVEN IN A PREDOMINANT FACTION IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY
909-131044-0006 IF THE CASE SHOULD ONLY BE THAT HE MIGHT LAY IT DOWN UNLESS CONTINUED BY A NEW CHOICE AND IF HE SHOULD BE DESIROUS OF BEING CONTINUED HIS WISHES CONSPIRING WITH HIS FEARS WOULD TEND STILL MORE POWERFULLY TO CORRUPT HIS INTEGRITY
909-131044-0007 EITHER IN THE COMMUNITY OR IN THE LEGISLATURE AS ITS BEST RECOMMENDATION BUT SUCH MEN ENTERTAIN VERY CRUDE NOTIONS AS WELL OF THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH GOVERNMENT WAS INSTITUTED AS OF THE TRUE MEANS BY WHICH THE PUBLIC HAPPINESS MAY BE PROMOTED
909-131044-0008 THE REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLE DEMANDS THAT THE DELIBERATE SENSE OF THE COMMUNITY SHOULD GOVERN THE CONDUCT OF THOSE TO WHOM THEY INTRUST THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR AFFAIRS BUT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE AN UNQUALIFIED COMPLAISANCE TO EVERY SUDDEN BREEZE OF PASSION
909-131044-0009 OR TO EVERY TRANSIENT IMPULSE WHICH THE PEOPLE MAY RECEIVE FROM THE ARTS OF MEN WHO FLATTER THEIR PREJUDICES TO BETRAY THEIR INTERESTS IT IS A JUST OBSERVATION THAT THE PEOPLE COMMONLY INTEND THE PUBLIC GOOD
909-131044-0010 THIS OFTEN APPLIES TO THEIR VERY ERRORS BUT THEIR GOOD SENSE WOULD DESPISE THE ADULATOR WHO SHOULD PRETEND THAT THEY ALWAYS REASON RIGHT ABOUT THE MEANS OF PROMOTING IT THEY KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT THEY SOMETIMES ERR AND THE WONDER IS
909-131044-0011 THAT THEY SO SELDOM ERR AS THEY DO BESET AS THEY CONTINUALLY ARE BY THE WILES OF PARASITES AND SYCOPHANTS BY THE SNARES OF THE AMBITIOUS THE AVARICIOUS THE DESPERATE BY THE ARTIFICES
909-131044-0012 OF MEN WHO POSSESS THEIR CONFIDENCE MORE THAN THEY DESERVE IT AND OF THOSE WHO SEEK TO POSSESS RATHER THAN TO DESERVE IT WHEN OCCASIONS PRESENT THEMSELVES IN WHICH THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE ARE AT VARIANCE WITH THEIR INCLINATIONS
909-131044-0013 IN WHICH A CONDUCT OF THIS KIND HAS SAVED THE PEOPLE FROM VERY FATAL CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR OWN MISTAKES AND HAS PROCURED LASTING MONUMENTS OF THEIR GRATITUDE TO THE MEN WHO HAD COURAGE AND MAGNANIMITY ENOUGH TO SERVE THEM AT THE PERIL OF THEIR DISPLEASURE
909-131044-0014 BUT HOWEVER INCLINED WE MIGHT BE TO INSIST UPON AN UNBOUNDED COMPLAISANCE IN THE EXECUTIVE TO THE INCLINATIONS OF THE PEOPLE WE CAN WITH NO PROPRIETY CONTEND FOR A LIKE COMPLAISANCE TO THE HUMORS OF THE LEGISLATURE
909-131044-0015 THE LATTER MAY SOMETIMES STAND IN OPPOSITION TO THE FORMER AND AT OTHER TIMES THE PEOPLE MAY BE ENTIRELY NEUTRAL IN EITHER SUPPOSITION IT IS CERTAINLY DESIRABLE THAT THE EXECUTIVE SHOULD BE IN A SITUATION TO DARE TO ACT HIS OWN OPINION WITH VIGOR AND DECISION
909-131044-0016 THE SAME RULE WHICH TEACHES THE PROPRIETY OF A PARTITION BETWEEN THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF POWER TEACHES US LIKEWISE THAT THIS PARTITION OUGHT TO BE SO CONTRIVED AS TO RENDER THE ONE INDEPENDENT OF THE OTHER
909-131044-0017 TO WHAT PURPOSE SEPARATE THE EXECUTIVE OR THE JUDICIARY FROM THE LEGISLATIVE IF BOTH THE EXECUTIVE AND THE JUDICIARY ARE SO CONSTITUTED AS TO BE AT THE ABSOLUTE DEVOTION OF THE LEGISLATIVE SUCH A SEPARATION MUST BE MERELY NOMINAL
909-131044-0018 AND ANOTHER TO BE DEPENDENT ON THE LEGISLATIVE BODY THE FIRST COMPORTS WITH THE LAST VIOLATES THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNMENT AND WHATEVER MAY BE THE FORMS OF THE CONSTITUTION UNITES ALL POWER IN THE SAME HANDS
909-131044-0019 THE TENDENCY OF THE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO ABSORB EVERY OTHER HAS BEEN FULLY DISPLAYED AND ILLUSTRATED BY EXAMPLES IN SOME PRECEDING NUMBERS IN GOVERNMENTS PURELY REPUBLICAN THIS TENDENCY IS ALMOST IRRESISTIBLE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE
909-131044-0020 THEY OFTEN APPEAR DISPOSED TO EXERT AN IMPERIOUS CONTROL OVER THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND AS THEY COMMONLY HAVE THE PEOPLE ON THEIR SIDE
909-131044-0021 THEY ALWAYS ACT WITH SUCH MOMENTUM AS TO MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT TO MAINTAIN THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION IT MAY PERHAPS BE ASKED HOW THE SHORTNESS OF THE DURATION IN OFFICE
909-131044-0022 CAN AFFECT THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE EXECUTIVE ON THE LEGISLATURE UNLESS THE ONE WERE POSSESSED OF THE POWER OF APPOINTING OR DISPLACING THE OTHER ONE ANSWER TO THIS INQUIRY MAY BE DRAWN FROM THE PRINCIPLE ALREADY REMARKED
909-131044-0023 THOUGH NOT MORE CONCLUSIVE WILL RESULT FROM THE CONSIDERATION OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OVER THE PEOPLE WHICH MIGHT BE EMPLOYED TO PREVENT THE RE ELECTION OF A MAN WHO BY AN UPRIGHT RESISTANCE TO ANY SINISTER PROJECT OF THAT BODY SHOULD HAVE MADE HIMSELF
909-131044-0024 OBNOXIOUS TO ITS RESENTMENT IT MAY BE ASKED ALSO WHETHER A DURATION OF FOUR YEARS WOULD ANSWER THE END PROPOSED AND IF IT WOULD NOT WHETHER A LESS PERIOD WHICH WOULD AT LEAST BE RECOMMENDED BY GREATER SECURITY AGAINST AMBITIOUS DESIGNS
909-131044-0025 WOULD NOT FOR THAT REASON BE PREFERABLE TO A LONGER PERIOD WHICH WAS AT THE SAME TIME TOO SHORT FOR THE PURPOSE OF INSPIRING THE DESIRED FIRMNESS AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE MAGISTRATE IT CANNOT BE AFFIRMED THAT A DURATION OF FOUR YEARS OR ANY OTHER LIMITED DURATION
909-131044-0026 THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE A CONSIDERABLE INTERVAL IN WHICH THE PROSPECT OF ANNIHILATION WOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY REMOTE NOT TO HAVE AN IMPROPER EFFECT UPON THE CONDUCT OF A MAN INDUED WITH A TOLERABLE PORTION OF FORTITUDE
909-131044-0027 AND IN WHICH HE MIGHT REASONABLY PROMISE HIMSELF THAT THERE WOULD BE TIME ENOUGH BEFORE IT ARRIVED TO MAKE THE COMMUNITY SENSIBLE OF THE PROPRIETY OF THE MEASURES HE MIGHT INCLINE TO PURSUE THOUGH IT BE PROBABLE THAT AS HE APPROACHED THE MOMENT
909-131044-0028 OF ESTABLISHING HIMSELF IN THE ESTEEM AND GOOD WILL OF HIS CONSTITUENTS HE MIGHT THEN HAZARD WITH SAFETY IN PROPORTION TO THE PROOFS HE HAD GIVEN OF HIS WISDOM AND INTEGRITY AND TO THE TITLE HE HAD ACQUIRED TO THE RESPECT AND ATTACHMENT OF HIS FELLOW CITIZENS
909-131044-0029 AS ON THE ONE HAND A DURATION OF FOUR YEARS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE FIRMNESS OF THE EXECUTIVE IN A SUFFICIENT DEGREE TO RENDER IT A VERY VALUABLE INGREDIENT IN THE COMPOSITION SO ON THE OTHER IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY ANY ALARM FOR THE PUBLIC LIBERTY
909-131044-0030 IF A BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS FROM THE MOST FEEBLE BEGINNINGS FROM THE MERE POWER OF ASSENTING OR DISAGREEING TO THE IMPOSITION OF A NEW TAX
909-131044-0031 HAVE BY RAPID STRIDES REDUCED THE PREROGATIVES OF THE CROWN AND THE PRIVILEGES OF THE NOBILITY WITHIN THE LIMITS THEY CONCEIVED TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF A FREE GOVERNMENT WHILE THEY RAISED THEMSELVES TO THE RANK AND CONSEQUENCE OF A COEQUAL BRANCH OF THE LEGISLATURE
909-131044-0032 ALL THE ANCIENT ESTABLISHMENTS AS WELL IN THE CHURCH AS STATE IF THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE ON A RECENT OCCASION TO MAKE THE MONARCH TREMBLE AT THE PROSPECT
909-131044-0033 WHAT BUT THAT HE MIGHT BE UNEQUAL TO THE TASK WHICH THE CONSTITUTION ASSIGNS HIM I SHALL ONLY ADD THAT IF HIS DURATION BE SUCH AS TO LEAVE A DOUBT OF HIS FIRMNESS THAT DOUBT IS INCONSISTENT WITH A JEALOUSY OF HIS ENCROACHMENTS
909-131045-0000 THE ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT IN ITS LARGEST SENSE COMPREHENDS ALL THE OPERATIONS OF THE BODY POLITIC WHETHER LEGISLATIVE EXECUTIVE OR JUDICIARY BUT IN ITS MOST USUAL AND PERHAPS ITS MOST PRECISE SIGNIFICATION
909-131045-0001 IT IS LIMITED TO EXECUTIVE DETAILS AND FALLS PECULIARLY WITHIN THE PROVINCE OF THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT THE ACTUAL CONDUCT OF FOREIGN NEGOTIATIONS THE PREPARATORY PLANS OF FINANCE
909-131045-0002 THE APPLICATION AND DISBURSEMENT OF THE PUBLIC MONEYS IN CONFORMITY TO THE GENERAL APPROPRIATIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE ARMY AND NAVY THE DIRECTIONS OF THE OPERATIONS OF WAR
909-131045-0003 THESE AND OTHER MATTERS OF A LIKE NATURE CONSTITUTE WHAT SEEMS TO BE MOST PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD BY THE ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT THE PERSONS THEREFORE TO WHOSE IMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT THESE DIFFERENT MATTERS ARE COMMITTED
909-131045-0004 OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED AS THE ASSISTANTS OR DEPUTIES OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AND ON THIS ACCOUNT THEY OUGHT TO DERIVE THEIR OFFICES FROM HIS APPOINTMENT AT LEAST FROM HIS NOMINATION AND OUGHT TO BE SUBJECT TO HIS SUPERINTENDENCE
909-131045-0005 THIS VIEW OF THE SUBJECT WILL AT ONCE SUGGEST TO US THE INTIMATE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE DURATION OF THE EXECUTIVE MAGISTRATE IN OFFICE AND THE STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION TO REVERSE AND UNDO WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BY A PREDECESSOR
909-131045-0006 THE PERSON SUBSTITUTED IS WARRANTED IN SUPPOSING THAT THE DISMISSION OF HIS PREDECESSOR HAS PROCEEDED FROM A DISLIKE TO HIS MEASURES AND THAT THE LESS HE RESEMBLES HIM THE MORE HE WILL RECOMMEND HIMSELF TO THE FAVOR OF HIS CONSTITUENTS
909-131045-0007 THESE CONSIDERATIONS AND THE INFLUENCE OF PERSONAL CONFIDENCES AND ATTACHMENTS WOULD BE LIKELY TO INDUCE EVERY NEW PRESIDENT TO PROMOTE A CHANGE OF MEN TO FILL THE SUBORDINATE STATIONS
909-131045-0008 AND THESE CAUSES TOGETHER COULD NOT FAIL TO OCCASION A DISGRACEFUL AND RUINOUS MUTABILITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE GOVERNMENT WITH A POSITIVE DURATION OF CONSIDERABLE EXTENT I CONNECT THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF RE ELIGIBILITY
909-131045-0009 THE FIRST IS NECESSARY TO GIVE TO THE OFFICER HIMSELF THE INCLINATION AND THE RESOLUTION TO ACT HIS PART WELL AND TO THE COMMUNITY TIME AND LEISURE TO OBSERVE THE TENDENCY OF HIS MEASURES AND THENCE TO FORM AN EXPERIMENTAL ESTIMATE OF THEIR MERITS
909-131045-0010 THE LAST IS NECESSARY TO ENABLE THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY SEE REASON TO APPROVE OF HIS CONDUCT TO CONTINUE HIM IN HIS STATION IN ORDER TO PROLONG THE UTILITY OF HIS TALENTS AND VIRTUES AND TO SECURE TO THE GOVERNMENT THE ADVANTAGE OF PERMANENCY
909-131045-0011 IN A WISE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION NOTHING APPEARS MORE PLAUSIBLE AT FIRST SIGHT NOR MORE ILL FOUNDED UPON CLOSE INSPECTION THAN A SCHEME WHICH IN RELATION TO THE PRESENT POINT HAS HAD SOME RESPECTABLE ADVOCATES I MEAN
909-131045-0012 THAT OF CONTINUING THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE IN OFFICE FOR A CERTAIN TIME AND THEN EXCLUDING HIM FROM IT EITHER FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OR FOREVER AFTER THIS EXCLUSION WHETHER TEMPORARY OR PERPETUAL WOULD HAVE NEARLY THE SAME EFFECTS
909-131045-0013 WHEN THEY WERE CONSCIOUS THAT THE ADVANTAGES OF THE STATION WITH WHICH IT WAS CONNECTED MUST BE RELINQUISHED AT A DETERMINATE PERIOD THAN WHEN THEY WERE PERMITTED TO ENTERTAIN A HOPE OF OBTAINING
909-131045-0014 IS TO MAKE THEIR INTERESTS COINCIDE WITH THEIR DUTY EVEN THE LOVE OF FAME THE RULING PASSION OF THE NOBLEST MINDS WHICH WOULD PROMPT A MAN TO PLAN AND UNDERTAKE EXTENSIVE AND ARDUOUS ENTERPRISES FOR THE PUBLIC BENEFIT
909-131045-0015 AND MUST COMMIT THAT TOGETHER WITH HIS OWN REPUTATION TO HANDS WHICH MIGHT BE UNEQUAL OR UNFRIENDLY TO THE TASK THE MOST TO BE EXPECTED FROM THE GENERALITY OF MEN IN SUCH A SITUATION IS THE NEGATIVE MERIT OF NOT DOING HARM
909-131045-0016 INSTEAD OF THE POSITIVE MERIT OF DOING GOOD ANOTHER ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE THE TEMPTATION TO SORDID VIEWS TO PECULATION AND IN SOME INSTANCES TO USURPATION
909-131045-0017 AN AVARICIOUS MAN WHO MIGHT HAPPEN TO FILL THE OFFICE LOOKING FORWARD TO A TIME WHEN HE MUST AT ALL EVENTS YIELD UP THE EMOLUMENTS HE ENJOYED WOULD FEEL A PROPENSITY NOT EASY TO BE RESISTED BY SUCH A MAN
909-131045-0018 TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF THE OPPORTUNITY HE ENJOYED WHILE IT LASTED AND MIGHT NOT SCRUPLE TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE MOST CORRUPT EXPEDIENTS TO MAKE THE HARVEST AS ABUNDANT AS IT WAS TRANSITORY THOUGH THE SAME MAN PROBABLY WITH A DIFFERENT PROSPECT BEFORE HIM
909-131045-0019 MIGHT CONTENT HIMSELF WITH THE REGULAR PERQUISITES OF HIS SITUATION AND MIGHT EVEN BE UNWILLING TO RISK THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN ABUSE OF HIS OPPORTUNITIES HIS AVARICE MIGHT BE A GUARD UPON HIS AVARICE
909-131045-0020 ADD TO THIS THAT THE SAME MAN MIGHT BE VAIN OR AMBITIOUS AS WELL AS AVARICIOUS AND IF HE COULD EXPECT TO PROLONG HIS HONORS BY HIS GOOD CONDUCT HE MIGHT HESITATE TO SACRIFICE HIS APPETITE FOR THEM TO HIS APPETITE FOR GAIN
909-131045-0021 BUT WITH THE PROSPECT BEFORE HIM OF APPROACHING AN INEVITABLE ANNIHILATION HIS AVARICE WOULD BE LIKELY TO GET THE VICTORY OVER HIS CAUTION HIS VANITY OR HIS AMBITION AN AMBITIOUS MAN TOO
909-131045-0022 WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF SEATED ON THE SUMMIT OF HIS COUNTRY'S HONORS WHEN HE LOOKED FORWARD TO THE TIME AT WHICH HE MUST DESCEND FROM THE EXALTED EMINENCE FOR EVER AND REFLECTED THAT NO EXERTION OF MERIT ON HIS PART COULD SAVE HIM FROM THE UNWELCOME REVERSE
909-131045-0023 AND SIGHING FOR A PLACE WHICH THEY WERE DESTINED NEVER MORE TO POSSESS A THIRD ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE
909-131045-0024 IN THE EXERCISE OF HIS OFFICE THAT EXPERIENCE IS THE PARENT OF WISDOM IS AN ADAGE THE TRUTH OF WHICH IS RECOGNIZED BY THE WISEST AS WELL AS THE SIMPLEST OF MANKIND WHAT MORE DESIRABLE OR MORE ESSENTIAL THAN THIS QUALITY IN THE GOVERNORS OF NATIONS
909-131045-0025 WHERE MORE DESIRABLE OR MORE ESSENTIAL THAN IN THE FIRST MAGISTRATE OF A NATION CAN IT BE WISE TO PUT THIS DESIRABLE AND ESSENTIAL QUALITY UNDER THE BAN OF THE CONSTITUTION AND TO DECLARE THAT THE MOMENT IT IS ACQUIRED ITS POSSESSOR SHALL BE COMPELLED
909-131045-0026 TO ABANDON THE STATION IN WHICH IT WAS ACQUIRED AND TO WHICH IT IS ADAPTED THIS NEVERTHELESS IS THE PRECISE IMPORT OF ALL THOSE REGULATIONS WHICH EXCLUDE MEN FROM SERVING THEIR COUNTRY
909-131045-0027 BY THE CHOICE OF THEIR FELLOWCITIZENS AFTER THEY HAVE BY A COURSE OF SERVICE FITTED THEMSELVES FOR DOING IT WITH A GREATER DEGREE OF UTILITY A FOURTH ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE THE BANISHING MEN FROM STATIONS IN WHICH
909-131045-0028 IN CERTAIN EMERGENCIES OF THE STATE THEIR PRESENCE MIGHT BE OF THE GREATEST MOMENT TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST OR SAFETY THERE IS NO NATION WHICH HAS NOT AT ONE PERIOD OR ANOTHER EXPERIENCED AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF THE SERVICES OF PARTICULAR MEN
909-131045-0029 IN PARTICULAR SITUATIONS PERHAPS IT WOULD NOT BE TOO STRONG TO SAY TO THE PRESERVATION OF ITS POLITICAL EXISTENCE HOW UNWISE THEREFORE MUST BE EVERY SUCH SELF DENYING ORDINANCE AS SERVES TO PROHIBIT A NATION FROM MAKING USE OF ITS OWN CITIZENS
909-131045-0030 IN THE MANNER BEST SUITED TO ITS EXIGENCIES AND CIRCUMSTANCES WITHOUT SUPPOSING THE PERSONAL ESSENTIALITY OF THE MAN IT IS EVIDENT THAT A CHANGE OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF A WAR OR AT ANY SIMILAR CRISIS FOR ANOTHER
909-131045-0031 EVEN OF EQUAL MERIT WOULD AT ALL TIMES BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE COMMUNITY INASMUCH AS IT WOULD SUBSTITUTE INEXPERIENCE TO EXPERIENCE AND WOULD TEND TO UNHINGE AND SET AFLOAT THE ALREADY SETTLED TRAIN OF THE ADMINISTRATION
909-131045-0032 A FIFTH ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE THAT IT WOULD OPERATE AS A CONSTITUTIONAL INTERDICTION OF STABILITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION BY NECESSITATING A CHANGE OF MEN IN THE FIRST OFFICE OF THE NATION
909-131045-0033 IT WOULD NECESSITATE A MUTABILITY OF MEASURES IT IS NOT GENERALLY TO BE EXPECTED THAT MEN WILL VARY AND MEASURES REMAIN UNIFORM THE CONTRARY IS THE USUAL COURSE OF THINGS
909-131045-0034 AND WE NEED NOT BE APPREHENSIVE THAT THERE WILL BE TOO MUCH STABILITY WHILE THERE IS EVEN THE OPTION OF CHANGING NOR NEED WE DESIRE TO PROHIBIT THE PEOPLE FROM CONTINUING THEIR CONFIDENCE WHERE THEY THINK IT MAY BE SAFELY PLACED AND WHERE BY CONSTANCY ON THEIR PART
909-131045-0035 THEY MAY OBVIATE THE FATAL INCONVENIENCES OF FLUCTUATING COUNCILS AND A VARIABLE POLICY THESE ARE SOME OF THE DISADVANTAGES WHICH WOULD FLOW FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF EXCLUSION THEY APPLY MOST FORCIBLY TO THE SCHEME OF A PERPETUAL EXCLUSION
909-131045-0036 BUT WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT EVEN A PARTIAL EXCLUSION WOULD ALWAYS RENDER THE READMISSION OF THE PERSON A REMOTE AND PRECARIOUS OBJECT THE OBSERVATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE WILL APPLY NEARLY AS FULLY TO ONE CASE AS TO THE OTHER
909-131045-0037 WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES PROMISED TO COUNTERBALANCE THESE DISADVANTAGES THEY ARE REPRESENTED TO BE FIRST GREATER INDEPENDENCE IN THE MAGISTRATE
909-131045-0038 UNLESS THE EXCLUSION BE PERPETUAL THERE WILL BE NO PRETENSE TO INFER THE FIRST ADVANTAGE BUT EVEN IN THAT CASE MAY HE HAVE NO OBJECT BEYOND HIS PRESENT STATION TO WHICH HE MAY SACRIFICE HIS INDEPENDENCE
909-131045-0039 ON THE ARRIVAL OF WHICH HE NOT ONLY MAY BUT MUST BE EXPOSED TO THEIR RESENTMENTS UPON AN EQUAL PERHAPS UPON AN INFERIOR FOOTING IT IS NOT AN EASY POINT TO DETERMINE WHETHER HIS INDEPENDENCE WOULD BE MOST PROMOTED OR IMPAIRED BY SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT
909-131045-0040 AS TO THE SECOND SUPPOSED ADVANTAGE THERE IS STILL GREATER REASON TO ENTERTAIN DOUBTS CONCERNING IT IF THE EXCLUSION WERE TO BE PERPETUAL A MAN OF IRREGULAR AMBITION OF WHOM ALONE THERE COULD BE REASON IN ANY CASE TO ENTERTAIN APPREHENSION
909-131045-0041 WOULD WITH INFINITE RELUCTANCE YIELD TO THE NECESSITY OF TAKING HIS LEAVE FOREVER OF A POST IN WHICH HIS PASSION FOR POWER AND PRE EMINENCE HAD ACQUIRED THE FORCE OF HABIT AND IF HE HAD BEEN FORTUNATE OR ADROIT ENOUGH TO CONCILIATE THE GOOD WILL OF THE PEOPLE
909-131045-0042 THERE MAY BE CONCEIVED CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THIS DISGUST OF THE PEOPLE SECONDING THE THWARTED AMBITION OF SUCH A FAVORITE MIGHT OCCASION GREATER DANGER TO LIBERTY THAN COULD EVER REASONABLY BE DREADED FROM THE POSSIBILITY OF A PERPETUATION IN OFFICE
909-131045-0043 BY THE VOLUNTARY SUFFRAGES OF THE COMMUNITY EXERCISING A CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGE THERE IS AN EXCESS OF REFINEMENT IN THE IDEA OF DISABLING THE PEOPLE TO CONTINUE IN OFFICE MEN WHO HAD ENTITLED THEMSELVES IN THEIR OPINION
911-128684-0000 ARE AS DUALISTIC AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO BE THOUGHTS WE ALL NATURALLY THINK ARE MADE OF ONE KIND OF SUBSTANCE AND THINGS OF ANOTHER CONSCIOUSNESS FLOWING INSIDE OF US IN THE FORMS OF CONCEPTION OR JUDGMENT
911-128684-0001 OR CONCENTRATING ITSELF IN THE SHAPE OF PASSION OR EMOTION CAN BE DIRECTLY FELT AS THE SPIRITUAL ACTIVITY WHICH IT IS AND KNOWN IN CONTRAST WITH THE SPACE FILLING OBJECTIVE CONTENT WHICH IT ENVELOPES AND ACCOMPANIES
911-128684-0002 IN OPPOSITION TO THIS DUALISTIC PHILOSOPHY I TRIED IN THE FIRST ESSAY TO SHOW THAT THOUGHTS AND THINGS ARE ABSOLUTELY HOMOGENEOUS AS TO THEIR MATERIAL AND THAT THEIR OPPOSITION IS ONLY ONE OF RELATION AND OF FUNCTION
911-128684-0003 THERE IS NO THOUGHT STUFF DIFFERENT FROM THING STUFF I SAID BUT THE SAME IDENTICAL PIECE OF PURE EXPERIENCE WHICH WAS THE NAME I GAVE TO THE MATERIA PRIMA OF EVERYTHING
911-128684-0004 CAN STAND ALTERNATELY FOR A FACT OF CONSCIOUSNESS OR FOR A PHYSICAL REALITY ACCORDING AS IT IS TAKEN IN ONE CONTEXT OR IN ANOTHER FOR THE RIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT FOLLOWS
911-128684-0005 IN OUR PLEASURES AND PAINS OUR LOVES AND FEARS AND ANGERS IN THE BEAUTY COMICALITY IMPORTANCE OR PRECIOUSNESS OF CERTAIN OBJECTS AND SITUATIONS WE HAVE I AM TOLD BY MANY CRITICS
911-128684-0006 A GREAT REALM OF EXPERIENCE INTUITIVELY RECOGNIZED AS SPIRITUAL MADE AND FELT TO BE MADE OF CONSCIOUSNESS EXCLUSIVELY AND DIFFERENT IN NATURE FROM THE SPACE FILLING KIND OF BEING WHICH IS ENJOYED BY PHYSICAL OBJECTS
911-128684-0007 BECAUSE I HAD TO BE SO BRIEF I NOW RETURN TO THE SUBJECT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT SO FAR FROM INVALIDATING MY GENERAL THESIS THESE PHENOMENA WHEN PROPERLY ANALYZED AFFORD IT POWERFUL SUPPORT
911-128684-0008 THE CENTRAL POINT OF THE PURE EXPERIENCE THEORY IS THAT OUTER AND INNER ARE NAMES FOR TWO GROUPS INTO WHICH WE SORT EXPERIENCES ACCORDING TO THE WAY IN WHICH THEY ACT UPON THEIR NEIGHBORS
911-128684-0009 ANY ONE CONTENT SUCH AS HARD LET US SAY CAN BE ASSIGNED TO EITHER GROUP IN THE OUTER GROUP IT IS STRONG IT ACTS ENERGETICALLY AND AGGRESSIVELY
911-128684-0010 HERE WHATEVER IS HARD INTERFERES WITH THE SPACE ITS NEIGHBORS OCCUPY IT DENTS THEM IS IMPENETRABLE BY THEM AND WE CALL THE HARDNESS THEN A PHYSICAL HARDNESS
911-128684-0011 IN THE MIND ON THE CONTRARY THE HARD THING IS NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR IT DENTS NOTHING IT SUFFUSES THROUGH ITS MENTAL NEIGHBORS AS IT WERE AND INTERPENETRATES THEM
911-128684-0012 TAKEN IN THIS GROUP WE CALL BOTH IT AND THEM IDEAS OR SENSATIONS AND THE BASIS OF THE TWO GROUPS RESPECTIVELY IS THE DIFFERENT TYPE OF INTERRELATION
911-128684-0013 THE MUTUAL IMPENETRABILITY ON THE ONE HAND AND THE LACK OF PHYSICAL INTERFERENCE AND INTERACTION ON THE OTHER THAT WHAT IN ITSELF IS ONE AND THE SAME ENTITY SHOULD BE ABLE TO FUNCTION THUS DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS
911-128684-0014 IS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE EXTREMELY COMPLEX RETICULATIONS IN WHICH OUR EXPERIENCES COME TO HER OFFSPRING A TIGRESS IS TENDER BUT CRUEL TO EVERY OTHER LIVING THING
911-128684-0015 BOTH CRUEL AND TENDER THEREFORE AT ONCE A MASS IN MOVEMENT RESISTS EVERY FORCE THAT OPERATES CONTRARIWISE TO ITS OWN DIRECTION BUT TO FORCES THAT PURSUE THE SAME DIRECTION OR COME IN AT RIGHT ANGLES
911-128684-0016 IT IS ABSOLUTELY INERT IT IS THUS BOTH ENERGETIC AND INERT AND THE SAME IS TRUE IF YOU VARY THE ASSOCIATES PROPERLY OF EVERY OTHER PIECE OF EXPERIENCE
911-128684-0017 IT IS ONLY TOWARDS CERTAIN SPECIFIC GROUPS OF ASSOCIATES THAT THE PHYSICAL ENERGIES AS WE CALL THEM OF A CONTENT ARE PUT FORTH IN ANOTHER GROUP IT MAY BE QUITE INERT
911-128684-0018 IT IS POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE A UNIVERSE OF EXPERIENCES IN WHICH THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE BETWEEN NEIGHBORS WOULD BE EITHER PHYSICAL INTERACTION OR COMPLETE INERTNESS
911-128684-0019 IN SUCH A WORLD THE MENTAL OR THE PHYSICAL STATUS OF ANY PIECE OF EXPERIENCE WOULD BE UNEQUIVOCAL WHEN ACTIVE IT WOULD FIGURE IN THE PHYSICAL AND WHEN INACTIVE IN THE MENTAL GROUP
911-128684-0020 BUT THE UNIVERSE WE LIVE IN IS MORE CHAOTIC THAN THIS AND THERE IS ROOM IN IT FOR THE HYBRID OR AMBIGUOUS GROUP OF OUR AFFECTIONAL EXPERIENCES OF OUR EMOTIONS AND APPRECIATIVE PERCEPTIONS
911-128684-0021 IN THE PARAGRAPHS THAT FOLLOW I SHALL TRY TO SHOW ONE THAT THE POPULAR NOTION THAT THESE EXPERIENCES ARE INTUITIVELY GIVEN AS PURELY INNER FACTS IS HASTY AND ERRONEOUS AND TWO
911-128684-0022 THAT THEIR AMBIGUITY ILLUSTRATES BEAUTIFULLY MY CENTRAL THESIS THAT SUBJECTIVITY AND OBJECTIVITY ARE AFFAIRS NOT OF WHAT AN EXPERIENCE IS ABORIGINALLY MADE OF BUT OF ITS CLASSIFICATION
911-128684-0023 CLASSIFICATIONS DEPEND ON OUR TEMPORARY PURPOSES FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES IT IS CONVENIENT TO TAKE THINGS IN ONE SET OF RELATIONS
911-128684-0024 IN THE TWO CASES THEIR CONTEXTS ARE APT TO BE DIFFERENT IN THE CASE OF OUR AFFECTIONAL EXPERIENCES WE HAVE NO PERMANENT AND STEADFAST PURPOSE THAT OBLIGES US TO BE CONSISTENT
911-128684-0025 SO WE FIND IT EASY TO LET THEM FLOAT AMBIGUOUSLY SOMETIMES CLASSING THEM WITH OUR FEELINGS SOMETIMES WITH MORE PHYSICAL REALITIES ACCORDING TO CAPRICE OR TO THE CONVENIENCE OF THE MOMENT
911-128684-0026 THUS WOULD THESE EXPERIENCES SO FAR FROM BEING AN OBSTACLE TO THE PURE EXPERIENCE PHILOSOPHY SERVE AS AN EXCELLENT CORROBORATION OF ITS TRUTH FIRST OF ALL THEN IT IS A MISTAKE TO SAY
911-128684-0027 WITH THE OBJECTORS WHOM I BEGAN BY CITING THAT ANGER LOVE AND FEAR ARE AFFECTIONS PURELY OF THE MIND
911-128684-0028 THEY ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY AFFECTIONS OF THE BODY
911-128684-0029 AND WE ARE ALWAYS FREE TO SPEAK OF THEM IN OBJECTIVE AS WELL AS IN SUBJECTIVE TERMS WE CAN SAY THAT WE ARE AWARE OF A PAINFUL PLACE FILLING A CERTAIN BIGNESS IN OUR ORGANISM
911-128684-0030 OR WE CAN SAY THAT WE ARE INWARDLY IN A STATE OF PAIN ALL OUR ADJECTIVES OF WORTH ARE SIMILARLY AMBIGUOUS
911-128684-0031 OR IS IT A FEELING IN OUR MIND PRACTICALLY WE TREAT IT AS BOTH OR AS EITHER ACCORDING TO THE TEMPORARY DIRECTION OF OUR THOUGHT BEAUTY SAYS PROFESSOR SANTAYANA IS PLEASURE OBJECTIFIED
911-128684-0032 AND IN SECTIONS TEN AND ELEVEN OF HIS WORK THE SENSE OF BEAUTY HE TREATS IN A MASTERLY WAY OF THIS EQUIVOCAL REALM THE VARIOUS PLEASURES WE RECEIVE FROM AN OBJECT
911-128684-0033 MAY COUNT AS FEELINGS WHEN WE TAKE THEM SINGLY BUT WHEN THEY COMBINE IN A TOTAL RICHNESS WE CALL THE RESULT THE BEAUTY OF THE OBJECT AND TREAT IT AS AN OUTER ATTRIBUTE WHICH OUR MIND PERCEIVES
911-128684-0034 WE DISCOVER BEAUTY JUST AS WE DISCOVER THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THINGS TRAINING IS NEEDED TO MAKE US EXPERT IN EITHER LINE SINGLE SENSATIONS ALSO MAY BE AMBIGUOUS SHALL WE SAY
911-128684-0035 AN AGREEABLE DEGREE OF HEAT OR AN AGREEABLE FEELING OCCASIONED BY THE DEGREE OF HEAT EITHER WILL DO AND LANGUAGE WOULD LOSE MOST OF ITS ESTHETIC AND RHETORICAL VALUE
911-128684-0036 WERE WE FORBIDDEN TO PROJECT WORDS PRIMARILY CONNOTING OUR AFFECTIONS UPON THE OBJECTS BY WHICH THE AFFECTIONS ARE AROUSED THE MAN IS REALLY HATEFUL THE ACTION REALLY MEAN THE SITUATION REALLY TRAGIC
911-128684-0037 ALL IN THEMSELVES AND QUITE APART FROM OUR OPINION WE EVEN GO SO FAR AS TO TALK OF A WEARY ROAD A GIDDY HEIGHT A JOCUND MORNING OR A SULLEN SKY
911-128684-0038 AND THE TERM INDEFINITE WHILE USUALLY APPLIED ONLY TO OUR APPREHENSIONS FUNCTIONS AS A FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICAL QUALIFICATION OF THINGS IN SPENCER'S LAW OF EVOLUTION
911-128684-0039 AND DOUBTLESS PASSES WITH MOST READERS FOR ALL RIGHT PSYCHOLOGISTS STUDYING OUR PERCEPTIONS OF MOVEMENT HAVE UNEARTHED EXPERIENCES IN WHICH MOVEMENT IS FELT IN GENERAL
911-128684-0040 BUT NOT ASCRIBED CORRECTLY TO THE BODY THAT REALLY MOVES THUS IN OPTICAL VERTIGO CAUSED BY UNCONSCIOUS MOVEMENTS OF OUR EYES BOTH WE AND THE EXTERNAL UNIVERSE APPEAR TO BE IN A WHIRL
911-128684-0041 WHEN CLOUDS FLOAT BY THE MOON IT IS AS IF BOTH CLOUDS AND MOON AND WE OURSELVES SHARED IN THE MOTION IN THE EXTRAORDINARY CASE OF AMNESIA
911-128684-0042 PUBLISHED BY SIDIS AND GOODHART IN THEIR IMPORTANT WORK ON MULTIPLE PERSONALITY WE READ THAT WHEN THE PATIENT FIRST RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS AND
911-128684-0043 NOTICED AN ATTENDANT WALK ACROSS THE ROOM HE IDENTIFIED THE MOVEMENT WITH THAT OF HIS OWN HE DID NOT YET DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN HIS OWN MOVEMENTS AND THOSE OUTSIDE HIMSELF
911-128684-0044 IN WHICH DISCRIMINATIONS AFTERWARDS NEEDFUL HAVE NOT YET BEEN MADE A PIECE OF EXPERIENCE OF A DETERMINATE SORT IS THERE BUT THERE AT FIRST AS A PURE FACT
911-128684-0045 MOTION ORIGINALLY SIMPLY IS ONLY LATER IS IT CONFINED TO THIS THING OR TO THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS TRUE OF EVERY EXPERIENCE HOWEVER COMPLEX
911-128684-0046 AT THE MOMENT OF ITS ACTUAL PRESENCE LET THE READER ARREST HIMSELF IN THE ACT OF READING THIS ARTICLE NOW
911-128684-0047 IS THERE AND WHETHER THERE FOR SOME ONE'S CONSCIOUSNESS OR THERE FOR PHYSICAL NATURE IS A QUESTION NOT YET PUT AT THE MOMENT IT IS THERE FOR NEITHER LATER
911-128684-0048 WE SHALL PROBABLY JUDGE IT TO HAVE BEEN THERE FOR BOTH WITH THE AFFECTIONAL EXPERIENCES WHICH WE ARE CONSIDERING THE RELATIVELY PURE CONDITION LASTS IN PRACTICAL LIFE NO URGENT NEED HAS YET ARISEN FOR DECIDING WHETHER TO TREAT THEM AS RIGOROUSLY MENTAL
911-128684-0049 OR AS RIGOROUSLY PHYSICAL FACTS SO THEY REMAIN EQUIVOCAL AND AS THE WORLD GOES THEIR EQUIVOCALITY IS ONE OF THEIR GREAT CONVENIENCES
911-128684-0050 ARE NOT COEFFICIENTS WITH WHICH EXPERIENCES COME TO US ABORIGINALLY STAMPED BUT ARE RATHER RESULTS OF A LATER CLASSIFICATION PERFORMED BY US FOR PARTICULAR NEEDS
911-128684-0051 THE COMMON SENSE STAGE OF THOUGHT IS A PERFECTLY DEFINITE PRACTICAL HALTING PLACE THE PLACE WHERE WE OURSELVES CAN PROCEED TO ACT UNHESITATINGLY ON THIS STAGE OF THOUGHT
911-128684-0052 THINGS ACT ON EACH OTHER AS WELL AS ON US BY MEANS OF THEIR SECONDARY QUALITIES SOUND AS SUCH GOES THROUGH THE AIR AND CAN BE INTERCEPTED
911-128684-0053 INTO THE WATER WHICH IT SETS A BOILING IT IS THE VERY LIGHT OF THE ARC LAMP WHICH DISPLACES THE DARKNESS OF THE MIDNIGHT STREET ET CETERA BY ENGENDERING AND TRANSLOCATING JUST THESE QUALITIES
911-128684-0054 ACTIVELY EFFICACIOUS AS THEY SEEM TO BE WE OURSELVES SUCCEED IN ALTERING NATURE SO AS TO SUIT US AND UNTIL MORE PURELY INTELLECTUAL AS DISTINGUISHED FROM PRACTICAL NEEDS HAD ARISEN
911-128684-0055 NO ONE EVER THOUGHT OF CALLING THESE QUALITIES SUBJECTIVE WHEN HOWEVER GALILEO DESCARTES AND OTHERS FOUND IT BEST FOR PHILOSOPHIC PURPOSES TO CLASS SOUND HEAT AND LIGHT ALONG WITH PAIN AND PLEASURE AS PURELY MENTAL PHENOMENA
911-128684-0056 HARDNESS AND SOFTNESS ARE EFFECTS ON US OF ATOMIC INTERACTIONS AND THE ATOMS THEMSELVES ARE NEITHER HARD NOR SOFT NOR SOLID NOR LIQUID SIZE AND SHAPE ARE DEEMED SUBJECTIVE BY KANTIANS
911-128684-0057 ARE NOW TREATED AS ILLUSORY PROJECTIONS OUTWARDS OF PHENOMENA OF OUR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS THERE ARE NO ACTIVITIES OR EFFECTS IN NATURE FOR THE MOST INTELLECTUAL CONTEMPORARY SCHOOL OF PHYSICAL SPECULATION
911-128684-0058 NATURE EXHIBITS ONLY CHANGES WHICH HABITUALLY COINCIDE WITH ONE ANOTHER
911-128684-0059 BUT ONLY A TRANSLOCATION OF EXPERIENCES FROM ONE WORLD TO ANOTHER A GROUPING OF THEM WITH ONE SET OR ANOTHER OF ASSOCIATES FOR DEFINITELY PRACTICAL OR INTELLECTUAL ENDS
911-128684-0060 I WILL SAY NOTHING HERE OF THE PERSISTENT AMBIGUITY OF RELATIONS THEY ARE UNDENIABLE PARTS OF PURE EXPERIENCE YET WHILE COMMON SENSE AND WHAT I CALL RADICAL EMPIRICISM STAND FOR THEIR BEING OBJECTIVE
911-128684-0061 BOTH RATIONALISM AND THE USUAL EMPIRICISM CLAIM THAT THEY ARE EXCLUSIVELY THE WORK OF THE MIND' THE FINITE MIND OR THE ABSOLUTE MIND AS THE CASE MAY BE
911-128684-0062 TURN NOW TO THOSE AFFECTIVE PHENOMENA WHICH MORE DIRECTLY CONCERN US WE SOON LEARN TO SEPARATE THE WAYS IN WHICH THINGS APPEAL TO OUR INTERESTS AND EMOTIONS FROM THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY ACT UPON ONE ANOTHER
911-128684-0063 IT DOES NOT WORK TO ASSUME THAT PHYSICAL OBJECTS ARE GOING TO ACT OUTWARDLY BY THEIR SYMPATHETIC OR ANTIPATHETIC QUALITIES THE BEAUTY OF A THING OR ITS VALUE IS NO FORCE THAT CAN BE PLOTTED IN A POLYGON OF COMPOSITIONS
911-128684-0064 NOR DOES ITS USE OR SIGNIFICANCE
911-128684-0065 ITS VICISSITUDES OR DESTINY AT THE HANDS OF PHYSICAL NATURE CHEMICAL AFFINITIES ARE A PURELY VERBAL METAPHOR AND AS I JUST SAID
911-128684-0066 EVEN SUCH THINGS AS FORCES TENSIONS AND ACTIVITIES CAN AT A PINCH BE REGARDED AS ANTHROPOMORPHIC PROJECTIONS SO FAR THEN AS THE PHYSICAL WORLD MEANS THE COLLECTION OF CONTENTS THAT DETERMINE IN EACH OTHER CERTAIN REGULAR CHANGES
911-128684-0067 THE WHOLE COLLECTION OF OUR APPRECIATIVE ATTRIBUTES HAS TO BE TREATED AS FALLING OUTSIDE OF IT IF WE MEAN BY PHYSICAL NATURE WHATEVER LIES BEYOND THE SURFACE OF OUR BODIES
911-128684-0068 WHY THEN DO MEN LEAVE THEM AS AMBIGUOUS AS THEY DO AND NOT CLASS THEM DECISIVELY AS PURELY SPIRITUAL THE REASON WOULD SEEM TO BE THAT ALTHOUGH THEY ARE INERT AS REGARDS THE REST OF PHYSICAL NATURE
911-128684-0069 THEY ARE NOT INERT AS REGARDS THAT PART OF PHYSICAL NATURE WHICH OUR OWN SKIN COVERS IT IS THOSE VERY APPRECIATIVE ATTRIBUTES OF THINGS THEIR DANGEROUSNESS BEAUTY RARITY UTILITY ET CETERA
911-128684-0070 THAT PRIMARILY APPEAL TO OUR ATTENTION IN OUR COMMERCE WITH NATURE THESE ATTRIBUTES ARE WHAT GIVE EMPHASIS TO OBJECTS AND FOR AN OBJECT TO BE EMPHATIC WHATEVER SPIRITUAL FACT IT MAY MEAN
911-128684-0071 MEANS ALSO THAT IT PRODUCES IMMEDIATE BODILY EFFECTS UPON US ALTERATIONS OF TONE AND TENSION OF HEART BEAT AND BREATHING OF VASCULAR AND VISCERAL ACTION
911-128684-0072 THE INTERESTING ASPECTS OF THINGS ARE THUS NOT WHOLLY INERT PHYSICALLY THOUGH THEY BE ACTIVE ONLY IN THESE SMALL CORNERS OF PHYSICAL NATURE WHICH OUR BODIES OCCUPY
911-128684-0073 THAT HOWEVER IS ENOUGH TO SAVE THEM FROM BEING CLASSED AS ABSOLUTELY NON OBJECTIVE THE ATTEMPT IF ANY ONE SHOULD MAKE IT TO SORT EXPERIENCES INTO TWO ABSOLUTELY DISCRETE GROUPS
911-128684-0074 WITH NOTHING BUT INERTNESS IN ONE OF THEM AND NOTHING BUT ACTIVITIES IN THE OTHER WOULD THUS RECEIVE ONE CHECK IT WOULD RECEIVE ANOTHER AS SOON AS WE EXAMINED THE MORE DISTINCTIVELY MENTAL GROUP
911-128684-0075 FOR THOUGH IN THAT GROUP IT BE TRUE THAT THINGS DO NOT ACT ON ONE ANOTHER BY THEIR PHYSICAL PROPERTIES DO NOT DENT EACH OTHER OR SET FIRE TO EACH OTHER
911-128684-0076 THEY YET ACT ON EACH OTHER IN THE MOST ENERGETIC WAY BY THOSE VERY CHARACTERS WHICH ARE SO INERT EXTRACORPOREALLY IT IS BY THE INTEREST AND IMPORTANCE THAT EXPERIENCES HAVE FOR US BY THE EMOTIONS THEY EXCITE
911-128684-0077 AND THE PURPOSES THEY SUBSERVE BY THEIR AFFECTIVE VALUES IN SHORT THAT THEIR CONSECUTION IN OUR SEVERAL CONSCIOUS STREAMS AS THOUGHTS OF OURS IS MAINLY RULED DESIRE INTRODUCES THEM INTEREST HOLDS THEM
911-128684-0078 FITNESS FIXES THEIR ORDER AND CONNECTION I NEED ONLY REFER FOR THIS ASPECT OF OUR MENTAL LIFE
911-128684-0079 IS THE MOST NATURAL THING IN THE WORLD IT WOULD HOWEVER BE AN UNNATURAL STATUS IF THE POPULAR OPINION WHICH I CITED AT THE OUTSET WERE CORRECT IF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL MEANT TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF INTRINSIC NATURE
911-128684-0080 IMMEDIATELY INTUITIVELY AND INFALLIBLY DISCERNIBLE AND EACH FIXED FOREVER IN WHATEVER BIT OF EXPERIENCE IT QUALIFIED ONE DOES NOT SEE HOW THERE COULD EVER HAVE ARISEN ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT OR AMBIGUITY
911-128684-0081 BUT IF ON THE CONTRARY THESE WORDS ARE WORDS OF SORTING AMBIGUITY IS NATURAL FOR THEN AS SOON AS THE RELATIONS OF A THING ARE SUFFICIENTLY VARIOUS IT CAN BE SORTED VARIOUSLY
911-128684-0082 TAKE A MASS OF CARRION FOR EXAMPLE
911-128684-0083 THE SUN CARESSES IT AND THE ZEPHYR WOOES IT AS IF IT WERE A BED OF ROSES SO THE DISGUSTINGNESS FAILS TO OPERATE WITHIN THE REALM OF SUNS AND BREEZES
911-128684-0084 IT DOES NOT FUNCTION AS A PHYSICAL QUALITY BUT THE CARRION TURNS OUR STOMACH BY WHAT SEEMS A DIRECT OPERATION IT DOES FUNCTION PHYSICALLY THEREFORE IN THAT LIMITED PART OF PHYSICS
911-128684-0085 AND CONVERSELY OF COURSE WE MUST TREAT IT AS NON MENTAL OR AS MENTAL OUR BODY ITSELF IS THE PALMARY INSTANCE OF THE AMBIGUOUS SOMETIMES I TREAT MY BODY PURELY AS A PART OF OUTER NATURE
911-128684-0086 SOMETIMES AGAIN I THINK OF IT AS MINE I SORT IT WITH THE ME AND THEN CERTAIN LOCAL CHANGES AND DETERMINATIONS IN IT PASS FOR SPIRITUAL HAPPENINGS ITS BREATHING IS MY THINKING
911-128684-0087 ITS SENSORIAL ADJUSTMENTS ARE MY ATTENTION
911-128684-0088 ITS VISCERAL PERTURBATIONS ARE MY EMOTIONS THE OBSTINATE CONTROVERSIES THAT HAVE ARISEN OVER SUCH STATEMENTS AS THESE WHICH SOUND SO PARADOXICAL AND WHICH CAN YET BE MADE SO SERIOUSLY
911-128684-0089 PROVE HOW HARD IT IS TO DECIDE BY BARE INTROSPECTION WHAT IT IS IN EXPERIENCES THAT SHALL MAKE THEM EITHER SPIRITUAL OR MATERIAL IT SURELY CAN BE NOTHING INTRINSIC IN THE INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE
911-128684-0090 IT IS THEIR WAY OF BEHAVING TOWARDS EACH OTHER THEIR SYSTEM OF RELATIONS THEIR FUNCTION AND ALL THESE THINGS VARY WITH THE CONTEXT IN WHICH WE FIND IT OPPORTUNE TO CONSIDER THEM I THINK I MAY CONCLUDE THEN
911-128684-0091 AND I HOPE THAT MY READERS ARE NOW READY TO CONCLUDE WITH ME THAT THE PRETENDED SPIRITUALITY OF OUR EMOTIONS AND OF OUR ATTRIBUTES OF VALUE SO FAR FROM PROVING AN OBJECTION TO THE PHILOSOPHY OF PURE EXPERIENCE DOES WHEN RIGHTLY DISCUSSED AND ACCOUNTED FOR
911-130578-0000 AND FOR THIS THE VILLAGE BOYS WITH WHOM HE PLAYED USED TO QUARREL WITH HIM SAYING FATHERLESS ORPHAN WHY DO YOU CHEAT SO ONE DAY HE ASKED HIS MOTHER WHY THEY CALLED HIM THAT NAME AND WHETHER HIS FATHER WAS REALLY DEAD
