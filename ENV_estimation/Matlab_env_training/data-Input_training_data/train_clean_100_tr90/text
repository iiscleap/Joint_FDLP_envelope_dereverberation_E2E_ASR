103-1240-0000 CHAPTER ONE MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE IS SURPRISED MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE LIVED JUST WHERE THE AVONLEA MAIN ROAD DIPPED DOWN INTO A LITTLE HOLLOW FRINGED WITH ALDERS AND LADIES EARDROPS AND TRAVERSED BY A BROOK
103-1240-0001 THAT HAD ITS SOURCE AWAY BACK IN THE WOODS OF THE OLD CUTHBERT PLACE IT WAS REPUTED TO BE AN INTRICATE HEADLONG BROOK IN ITS EARLIER COURSE THROUGH THOSE WOODS WITH DARK SECRETS OF POOL AND CASCADE BUT BY THE TIME IT REACHED LYNDE'S HOLLOW IT WAS A QUIET WELL CONDUCTED LITTLE STREAM
103-1240-0002 FOR NOT EVEN A BROOK COULD RUN PAST MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE'S DOOR WITHOUT DUE REGARD FOR DECENCY AND DECORUM IT PROBABLY WAS CONSCIOUS THAT MISSUS RACHEL WAS SITTING AT HER WINDOW KEEPING A SHARP EYE ON EVERYTHING THAT PASSED FROM BROOKS AND CHILDREN UP
103-1240-0003 AND THAT IF SHE NOTICED ANYTHING ODD OR OUT OF PLACE SHE WOULD NEVER REST UNTIL SHE HAD FERRETED OUT THE WHYS AND WHEREFORES THEREOF THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE IN AVONLEA AND OUT OF IT WHO CAN ATTEND CLOSELY TO THEIR NEIGHBOR'S BUSINESS BY DINT OF NEGLECTING THEIR OWN
103-1240-0004 BUT MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE WAS ONE OF THOSE CAPABLE CREATURES WHO CAN MANAGE THEIR OWN CONCERNS AND THOSE OF OTHER FOLKS INTO THE BARGAIN SHE WAS A NOTABLE HOUSEWIFE HER WORK WAS ALWAYS DONE AND WELL DONE SHE RAN THE SEWING CIRCLE
103-1240-0005 HELPED RUN THE SUNDAY SCHOOL AND WAS THE STRONGEST PROP OF THE CHURCH AID SOCIETY AND FOREIGN MISSIONS AUXILIARY YET WITH ALL THIS MISSUS RACHEL FOUND ABUNDANT TIME TO SIT FOR HOURS AT HER KITCHEN WINDOW KNITTING COTTON WARP QUILTS SHE HAD KNITTED SIXTEEN OF THEM
103-1240-0006 AS AVONLEA HOUSEKEEPERS WERE WONT TO TELL IN AWED VOICES AND KEEPING A SHARP EYE ON THE MAIN ROAD THAT CROSSED THE HOLLOW AND WOUND UP THE STEEP RED HILL BEYOND
103-1240-0007 ANYBODY WHO WENT OUT OF IT OR INTO IT HAD TO PASS OVER THAT HILL ROAD AND SO RUN THE UNSEEN GAUNTLET OF MISSUS RACHEL'S ALL SEEING EYE SHE WAS SITTING THERE ONE AFTERNOON IN EARLY JUNE THE SUN WAS COMING IN AT THE WINDOW WARM AND BRIGHT
103-1240-0008 THE ORCHARD ON THE SLOPE BELOW THE HOUSE WAS IN A BRIDAL FLUSH OF PINKY WHITE BLOOM HUMMED OVER BY A MYRIAD OF BEES THOMAS LYNDE A MEEK LITTLE MAN WHOM AVONLEA PEOPLE CALLED RACHEL LYNDE'S HUSBAND WAS SOWING HIS LATE TURNIP SEED ON THE HILL FIELD BEYOND THE BARN
103-1240-0009 MISSUS RACHEL KNEW THAT HE OUGHT BECAUSE SHE HAD HEARD HIM TELL PETER MORRISON THE EVENING BEFORE IN WILLIAM J BLAIR'S STORE OVER AT CARMODY THAT HE MEANT TO SOW HIS TURNIP SEED THE NEXT AFTERNOON
103-1240-0010 PETER HAD ASKED HIM OF COURSE FOR MATTHEW CUTHBERT HAD NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO VOLUNTEER INFORMATION ABOUT ANYTHING IN HIS WHOLE LIFE AND YET HERE WAS MATTHEW CUTHBERT AT HALF PAST THREE ON THE AFTERNOON OF A BUSY DAY PLACIDLY DRIVING OVER THE HOLLOW AND UP THE HILL
103-1240-0011 AND HIS BEST SUIT OF CLOTHES WHICH WAS PLAIN PROOF THAT HE WAS GOING OUT OF AVONLEA AND HE HAD THE BUGGY AND THE SORREL MARE WHICH BETOKENED THAT HE WAS GOING A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE NOW WHERE WAS MATTHEW CUTHBERT GOING AND WHY WAS HE GOING THERE
103-1240-0012 HAD IT BEEN ANY OTHER MAN IN AVONLEA MISSUS RACHEL DEFTLY PUTTING THIS AND THAT TOGETHER MIGHT HAVE GIVEN A PRETTY GOOD GUESS AS TO BOTH QUESTIONS BUT MATTHEW SO RARELY WENT FROM HOME THAT IT MUST BE SOMETHING PRESSING AND UNUSUAL WHICH WAS TAKING HIM
103-1240-0013 HE WAS THE SHYEST MAN ALIVE AND HATED TO HAVE TO GO AMONG STRANGERS OR TO ANY PLACE WHERE HE MIGHT HAVE TO TALK MATTHEW DRESSED UP WITH A WHITE COLLAR AND DRIVING IN A BUGGY WAS SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN OFTEN MISSUS RACHEL PONDER AS SHE MIGHT COULD MAKE NOTHING OF IT
103-1240-0014 AND HER AFTERNOON'S ENJOYMENT WAS SPOILED I'LL JUST STEP OVER TO GREEN GABLES AFTER TEA AND FIND OUT FROM MARILLA WHERE HE'S GONE AND WHY THE WORTHY WOMAN FINALLY CONCLUDED HE DOESN'T GENERALLY GO TO TOWN THIS TIME OF YEAR AND HE NEVER VISITS
103-1240-0015 IF HE'D RUN OUT OF TURNIP SEED HE WOULDN'T DRESS UP AND TAKE THE BUGGY TO GO FOR MORE
103-1240-0016 YET SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED SINCE LAST NIGHT TO START HIM OFF I'M CLEAN PUZZLED THAT'S WHAT AND I WON'T KNOW A MINUTE'S PEACE OF MIND OR CONSCIENCE UNTIL I KNOW WHAT HAS TAKEN MATTHEW CUTHBERT OUT OF AVONLEA TODAY ACCORDINGLY AFTER TEA MISSUS RACHEL SET OUT SHE HAD NOT FAR TO GO
103-1240-0017 THE BIG RAMBLING ORCHARD EMBOWERED HOUSE WHERE THE CUTHBERTS LIVED WAS A SCANT QUARTER OF A MILE UP THE ROAD FROM LYNDE'S HOLLOW TO BE SURE THE LONG LANE MADE IT A GOOD DEAL FURTHER MATTHEW CUTHBERT'S FATHER AS SHY AND SILENT AS HIS SON AFTER HIM
103-1240-0018 HAD GOT AS FAR AWAY AS HE POSSIBLY COULD FROM HIS FELLOW MEN WITHOUT ACTUALLY RETREATING INTO THE WOODS WHEN HE FOUNDED HIS HOMESTEAD GREEN GABLES WAS BUILT AT THE FURTHEST EDGE OF HIS CLEARED LAND AND THERE IT WAS TO THIS DAY
103-1240-0019 BARELY VISIBLE FROM THE MAIN ROAD ALONG WHICH ALL THE OTHER AVONLEA HOUSES WERE SO SOCIABLY SITUATED MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE DID NOT CALL LIVING IN SUCH A PLACE LIVING AT ALL IT'S JUST STAYING THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID AS SHE STEPPED ALONG THE DEEP RUTTED GRASSY LANE
103-1240-0020 BORDERED WITH WILD ROSE BUSHES IT'S NO WONDER MATTHEW AND MARILLA ARE BOTH A LITTLE ODD LIVING AWAY BACK HERE BY THEMSELVES TREES AREN'T MUCH COMPANY THOUGH DEAR KNOWS IF THEY WERE THERE'D BE ENOUGH OF THEM I'D RUTHER LOOK AT PEOPLE TO BE SURE
103-1240-0021 THEY SEEM CONTENTED ENOUGH BUT THEN I SUPPOSE THEY'RE USED TO IT A BODY CAN GET USED TO ANYTHING EVEN TO BEING HANGED AS THE IRISHMAN SAID WITH THIS MISSUS RACHEL STEPPED OUT OF THE LANE INTO THE BACKYARD OF GREEN GABLES VERY GREEN AND NEAT AND PRECISE WAS THAT YARD
103-1240-0022 SET ABOUT ON ONE SIDE WITH GREAT PATRIARCHAL WILLOWS AND THE OTHER WITH PRIM LOMBARDIES NOT A STRAY STICK NOR STONE WAS TO BE SEEN FOR MISSUS RACHEL WOULD HAVE SEEN IT IF THERE HAD BEEN PRIVATELY SHE WAS OF THE OPINION THAT MARILLA CUTHBERT SWEPT THAT YARD OVER AS OFTEN AS SHE SWEPT HER HOUSE
103-1240-0023 ONE COULD HAVE EATEN A MEAL OFF THE GROUND WITHOUT OVERBRIMMING THE PROVERBIAL PECK OF DIRT MISSUS RACHEL RAPPED SMARTLY AT THE KITCHEN DOOR AND STEPPED IN WHEN BIDDEN TO DO SO THE KITCHEN AT GREEN GABLES WAS A CHEERFUL APARTMENT
103-1240-0024 OR WOULD HAVE BEEN CHEERFUL IF IT HAD NOT BEEN SO PAINFULLY CLEAN AS TO GIVE IT SOMETHING OF THE APPEARANCE OF AN UNUSED PARLOR ITS WINDOWS LOOKED EAST AND WEST THROUGH THE WEST ONE LOOKING OUT ON THE BACK YARD CAME A FLOOD OF MELLOW JUNE SUNLIGHT BUT THE EAST ONE
103-1240-0025 WHENCE YOU GOT A GLIMPSE OF THE BLOOM WHITE CHERRY TREES IN THE LEFT ORCHARD AND NODDING SLENDER BIRCHES DOWN IN THE HOLLOW BY THE BROOK WAS GREENED OVER BY A TANGLE OF VINES HERE SAT MARILLA CUTHBERT WHEN SHE SAT AT ALL ALWAYS SLIGHTLY DISTRUSTFUL OF SUNSHINE
103-1240-0026 AND HERE SHE SAT NOW KNITTING AND THE TABLE BEHIND HER WAS LAID FOR SUPPER MISSUS RACHEL BEFORE SHE HAD FAIRLY CLOSED THE DOOR
103-1240-0027 THERE WERE THREE PLATES LAID SO THAT MARILLA MUST BE EXPECTING SOME ONE HOME WITH MATTHEW TO TEA BUT THE DISHES WERE EVERYDAY DISHES AND THERE WAS ONLY CRAB APPLE PRESERVES AND ONE KIND OF CAKE SO THAT THE EXPECTED COMPANY COULD NOT BE ANY PARTICULAR COMPANY
103-1240-0028 YET WHAT OF MATTHEW'S WHITE COLLAR AND THE SORREL MARE MISSUS RACHEL WAS GETTING FAIRLY DIZZY WITH THIS UNUSUAL MYSTERY ABOUT QUIET UNMYSTERIOUS GREEN GABLES GOOD EVENING RACHEL MARILLA SAID BRISKLY THIS IS A REAL FINE EVENING ISN'T IT WON'T YOU SIT DOWN
103-1240-0029 HOW ARE ALL YOUR FOLKS SOMETHING THAT FOR LACK OF ANY OTHER NAME MIGHT BE CALLED FRIENDSHIP EXISTED AND ALWAYS HAD EXISTED BETWEEN MARILLA CUTHBERT AND MISSUS RACHEL IN SPITE OF OR PERHAPS BECAUSE OF THEIR DISSIMILARITY MARILLA WAS A TALL
103-1240-0030 THIN WOMAN WITH ANGLES AND WITHOUT CURVES HER DARK HAIR SHOWED SOME GRAY STREAKS AND WAS ALWAYS TWISTED UP IN A HARD LITTLE KNOT BEHIND WITH TWO WIRE HAIRPINS STUCK AGGRESSIVELY THROUGH IT SHE LOOKED LIKE A WOMAN OF NARROW EXPERIENCE AND RIGID CONSCIENCE WHICH SHE WAS
103-1240-0031 BUT THERE WAS A SAVING SOMETHING ABOUT HER MOUTH WHICH IF IT HAD BEEN EVER SO SLIGHTLY DEVELOPED MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED INDICATIVE OF A SENSE OF HUMOR WE'RE ALL PRETTY WELL SAID MISSUS RACHEL I WAS KIND OF AFRAID YOU WEREN'T THOUGH WHEN I SAW MATTHEW STARTING OFF TODAY I THOUGHT MAYBE HE WAS GOING TO THE DOCTOR'S
103-1240-0032 MARILLA'S LIPS TWITCHED UNDERSTANDINGLY SHE HAD EXPECTED MISSUS RACHEL UP SHE HAD KNOWN THAT THE SIGHT OF MATTHEW JAUNTING OFF SO UNACCOUNTABLY WOULD BE TOO MUCH FOR HER NEIGHBOR'S CURIOSITY OH NO I'M QUITE WELL ALTHOUGH I HAD A BAD HEADACHE YESTERDAY SHE SAID
103-1240-0033 MATTHEW WENT TO BRIGHT RIVER WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE BOY FROM AN ORPHAN ASYLUM IN NOVA SCOTIA AND HE'S COMING ON THE TRAIN TONIGHT IF MARILLA HAD SAID THAT MATTHEW HAD GONE TO BRIGHT RIVER TO MEET A KANGAROO FROM AUSTRALIA MISSUS RACHEL COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE ASTONISHED
103-1240-0034 SHE WAS ACTUALLY STRICKEN DUMB FOR FIVE SECONDS IT WAS UNSUPPOSABLE THAT MARILLA WAS MAKING FUN OF HER BUT MISSUS RACHEL WAS ALMOST FORCED TO SUPPOSE IT ARE YOU IN EARNEST MARILLA SHE DEMANDED WHEN VOICE RETURNED TO HER YES OF COURSE
103-1240-0035 SAID MARILLA AS IF GETTING BOYS FROM ORPHAN ASYLUMS IN NOVA SCOTIA WERE PART OF THE USUAL SPRING WORK ON ANY WELL REGULATED AVONLEA FARM INSTEAD OF BEING AN UNHEARD OF INNOVATION MISSUS RACHEL FELT THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED A SEVERE MENTAL JOLT SHE THOUGHT IN EXCLAMATION POINTS
103-1240-0036 MARILLA AND MATTHEW CUTHBERT OF ALL PEOPLE ADOPTING A BOY FROM AN ORPHAN ASYLUM WELL THE WORLD WAS CERTAINLY TURNING UPSIDE DOWN SHE WOULD BE SURPRISED AT NOTHING AFTER THIS NOTHING
103-1240-0037 WHAT ON EARTH PUT SUCH A NOTION INTO YOUR HEAD SHE DEMANDED DISAPPROVINGLY THIS HAD BEEN DONE WITHOUT HER ADVICE BEING ASKED AND MUST PERFORCE BE DISAPPROVED WELL WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT FOR SOME TIME ALL WINTER IN FACT RETURNED MARILLA
103-1240-0038 MISSUS ALEXANDER SPENCER WAS UP HERE ONE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO GET A LITTLE GIRL FROM THE ASYLUM OVER IN HOPETON IN THE SPRING
103-1240-0039 SO MATTHEW AND I HAVE TALKED IT OVER OFF AND ON EVER SINCE WE THOUGHT WE'D GET A BOY MATTHEW IS GETTING UP IN YEARS YOU KNOW HE'S SIXTY AND HE ISN'T SO SPRY AS HE ONCE WAS HIS HEART TROUBLES HIM A GOOD DEAL AND YOU KNOW HOW DESPERATE HARD IT'S GOT TO BE TO GET HIRED HELP
103-1240-0040 THERE'S NEVER ANYBODY TO BE HAD BUT THOSE STUPID HALF GROWN LITTLE FRENCH BOYS AND AS SOON AS YOU DO GET ONE BROKE INTO YOUR WAYS AND TAUGHT SOMETHING HE'S UP AND OFF TO THE LOBSTER CANNERIES OR THE STATES AT FIRST MATTHEW SUGGESTED GETTING A HOME BOY BUT I SAID NO FLAT TO THAT
103-1240-0041 THEY MAY BE ALL RIGHT I'M NOT SAYING THEY'RE NOT BUT NO LONDON STREET ARABS FOR ME I SAID GIVE ME A NATIVE BORN AT LEAST THERE'LL BE A RISK NO MATTER WHO WE GET BUT I'LL FEEL EASIER IN MY MIND AND SLEEP SOUNDER AT NIGHTS IF WE GET A BORN CANADIAN
103-1240-0042 SO IN THE END WE DECIDED TO ASK MISSUS SPENCER TO PICK US OUT ONE WHEN SHE WENT OVER TO GET HER LITTLE GIRL WE HEARD LAST WEEK SHE WAS GOING SO WE SENT HER WORD BY RICHARD SPENCER'S FOLKS AT CARMODY TO BRING US A SMART LIKELY BOY OF ABOUT TEN OR ELEVEN WE DECIDED THAT WOULD BE THE BEST AGE
103-1240-0043 OLD ENOUGH TO BE OF SOME USE IN DOING CHORES RIGHT OFF AND YOUNG ENOUGH TO BE TRAINED UP PROPER WE MEAN TO GIVE HIM A GOOD HOME AND SCHOOLING WE HAD A TELEGRAM FROM MISSUS ALEXANDER SPENCER TODAY THE MAIL MAN BROUGHT IT FROM THE STATION SAYING THEY WERE COMING ON THE FIVE THIRTY TRAIN TONIGHT
103-1240-0044 SO MATTHEW WENT TO BRIGHT RIVER TO MEET HIM MISSUS SPENCER WILL DROP HIM OFF THERE OF COURSE SHE GOES ON TO WHITE SANDS STATION HERSELF MISSUS RACHEL PRIDED HERSELF ON ALWAYS SPEAKING HER MIND SHE PROCEEDED TO SPEAK IT NOW HAVING ADJUSTED HER MENTAL ATTITUDE TO THIS AMAZING PIECE OF NEWS
103-1240-0045 WELL MARILLA I'LL JUST TELL YOU PLAIN THAT I THINK YOU'RE DOING A MIGHTY FOOLISH THING A RISKY THING THAT'S WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING YOU'RE BRINGING A STRANGE CHILD INTO YOUR HOUSE AND HOME AND YOU DON'T KNOW A SINGLE THING ABOUT HIM NOR WHAT HIS DISPOSITION IS LIKE NOR WHAT SORT OF PARENTS HE HAD
103-1240-0046 NOR HOW HE'S LIKELY TO TURN OUT WHY IT WAS ONLY LAST WEEK I READ IN THE PAPER HOW A MAN AND HIS WIFE UP WEST OF THE ISLAND TOOK A BOY OUT OF AN ORPHAN ASYLUM AND HE SET FIRE TO THE HOUSE AT NIGHT SET IT ON PURPOSE MARILLA AND NEARLY BURNT THEM TO A CRISP IN THEIR BEDS
103-1240-0047 AND I KNOW ANOTHER CASE WHERE AN ADOPTED BOY USED TO SUCK THE EGGS THEY COULDN'T BREAK HIM OF IT IF YOU HAD ASKED MY ADVICE IN THE MATTER WHICH YOU DIDN'T DO MARILLA I'D HAVE SAID FOR MERCY'S SAKE NOT TO THINK OF SUCH A THING THAT'S WHAT
103-1240-0048 THIS JOB'S COMFORTING SEEMED NEITHER TO OFFEND NOR TO ALARM MARILLA SHE KNITTED STEADILY ON I DON'T DENY THERE'S SOMETHING IN WHAT YOU SAY RACHEL I'VE HAD SOME QUALMS MYSELF BUT MATTHEW WAS TERRIBLE SET ON IT I COULD SEE THAT SO I GAVE IN
103-1240-0049 IT'S SO SELDOM MATTHEW SETS HIS MIND ON ANYTHING THAT WHEN HE DOES I ALWAYS FEEL IT'S MY DUTY TO GIVE IN AND AS FOR THE RISK THERE'S RISKS IN PRETTY NEAR EVERYTHING A BODY DOES IN THIS WORLD THERE'S RISKS IN PEOPLE'S HAVING CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN IF IT COMES TO THAT THEY DON'T ALWAYS TURN OUT WELL
103-1240-0050 AND THEN NOVA SCOTIA IS RIGHT CLOSE TO THE ISLAND IT ISN'T AS IF WE WERE GETTING HIM FROM ENGLAND OR THE STATES HE CAN'T BE MUCH DIFFERENT FROM OURSELVES WELL I HOPE IT WILL TURN OUT ALL RIGHT SAID MISSUS RACHEL IN A TONE THAT PLAINLY INDICATED HER PAINFUL DOUBTS
103-1240-0051 ONLY DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU IF HE BURNS GREEN GABLES DOWN OR PUTS STRYCHNINE IN THE WELL I HEARD OF A CASE OVER IN NEW BRUNSWICK WHERE AN ORPHAN ASYLUM CHILD DID THAT AND THE WHOLE FAMILY DIED IN FEARFUL AGONIES ONLY IT WAS A GIRL IN THAT INSTANCE WELL WE'RE NOT GETTING A GIRL SAID MARILLA
103-1240-0052 AS IF POISONING WELLS WERE A PURELY FEMININE ACCOMPLISHMENT AND NOT TO BE DREADED IN THE CASE OF A BOY I'D NEVER DREAM OF TAKING A GIRL TO BRING UP I WONDER AT MISSUS ALEXANDER SPENCER FOR DOING IT BUT THERE SHE WOULDN'T SHRINK FROM ADOPTING A WHOLE ORPHAN ASYLUM IF SHE TOOK IT INTO HER HEAD
103-1240-0053 MISSUS RACHEL WOULD HAVE LIKED TO STAY UNTIL MATTHEW CAME HOME WITH HIS IMPORTED ORPHAN BUT REFLECTING THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD TWO HOURS AT LEAST BEFORE HIS ARRIVAL SHE CONCLUDED TO GO UP THE ROAD TO ROBERT BELL'S AND TELL THE NEWS IT WOULD CERTAINLY MAKE A SENSATION SECOND TO NONE
103-1240-0054 AND MISSUS RACHEL DEARLY LOVED TO MAKE A SENSATION SO SHE TOOK HERSELF AWAY SOMEWHAT TO MARILLA'S RELIEF FOR THE LATTER FELT HER DOUBTS AND FEARS REVIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MISSUS RACHEL'S PESSIMISM WELL OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER WERE OR WILL BE EJACULATED MISSUS RACHEL WHEN SHE WAS SAFELY OUT IN THE LANE
103-1240-0055 IT DOES REALLY SEEM AS IF I MUST BE DREAMING WELL I'M SORRY FOR THAT POOR YOUNG ONE AND NO MISTAKE MATTHEW AND MARILLA DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CHILDREN AND THEY'LL EXPECT HIM TO BE WISER AND STEADIER THAT HIS OWN GRANDFATHER
103-1240-0056 IT SEEMS UNCANNY TO THINK OF A CHILD AT GREEN GABLES SOMEHOW THERE'S NEVER BEEN ONE THERE FOR MATTHEW AND MARILLA WERE GROWN UP WHEN THE NEW HOUSE WAS BUILT IF THEY EVER WERE CHILDREN WHICH IS HARD TO BELIEVE WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THEM I WOULDN'T BE IN THAT ORPHAN'S SHOES FOR ANYTHING
103-1240-0057 MY BUT I PITY HIM THAT'S WHAT SO SAID MISSUS RACHEL TO THE WILD ROSE BUSHES OUT OF THE FULNESS OF HER HEART
103-1241-0000 CHAPTER TWO MATTHEW CUTHBERT IS SURPRISED MATTHEW CUTHBERT AND THE SORREL MARE JOGGED COMFORTABLY OVER THE EIGHT MILES TO BRIGHT RIVER IT WAS A PRETTY ROAD RUNNING ALONG BETWEEN SNUG FARMSTEADS WITH NOW AND AGAIN A BIT OF BALSAMY FIR WOOD TO DRIVE THROUGH
103-1241-0001 OR A HOLLOW WHERE WILD PLUMS HUNG OUT THEIR FILMY BLOOM THE AIR WAS SWEET WITH THE BREATH OF MANY APPLE ORCHARDS AND THE MEADOWS SLOPED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE TO HORIZON MISTS OF PEARL AND PURPLE WHILE THE LITTLE BIRDS SANG AS IF IT WERE THE ONE DAY OF SUMMER IN ALL THE YEAR
103-1241-0002 MATTHEW ENJOYED THE DRIVE AFTER HIS OWN FASHION EXCEPT DURING THE MOMENTS WHEN HE MET WOMEN AND HAD TO NOD TO THEM FOR IN PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO NOD TO ALL AND SUNDRY YOU MEET ON THE ROAD WHETHER YOU KNOW THEM OR NOT MATTHEW DREADED ALL WOMEN EXCEPT MARILLA AND MISSUS RACHEL
103-1241-0003 HE HAD AN UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING THAT THE MYSTERIOUS CREATURES WERE SECRETLY LAUGHING AT HIM HE MAY HAVE BEEN QUITE RIGHT IN THINKING SO FOR HE WAS AN ODD LOOKING PERSONAGE WITH AN UNGAINLY FIGURE AND LONG IRON GRAY HAIR THAT TOUCHED HIS STOOPING SHOULDERS
103-1241-0004 AND A FULL SOFT BROWN BEARD WHICH HE HAD WORN EVER SINCE HE WAS TWENTY IN FACT HE HAD LOOKED AT TWENTY VERY MUCH AS HE LOOKED AT SIXTY LACKING A LITTLE OF THE GRAYNESS WHEN HE REACHED BRIGHT RIVER THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY TRAIN
103-1241-0005 HE THOUGHT HE WAS TOO EARLY SO HE TIED HIS HORSE IN THE YARD OF THE SMALL BRIGHT RIVER HOTEL AND WENT OVER TO THE STATION HOUSE THE LONG PLATFORM WAS ALMOST DESERTED THE ONLY LIVING CREATURE IN SIGHT BEING A GIRL WHO WAS SITTING ON A PILE OF SHINGLES AT THE EXTREME END
103-1241-0006 MATTHEW BARELY NOTING THAT IT WAS A GIRL SIDLED PAST HER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER HAD HE LOOKED HE COULD HARDLY HAVE FAILED TO NOTICE THE TENSE RIGIDITY AND EXPECTATION OF HER ATTITUDE AND EXPRESSION SHE WAS SITTING THERE WAITING FOR SOMETHING OR SOMEBODY
103-1241-0007 AND SINCE SITTING AND WAITING WAS THE ONLY THING TO DO JUST THEN SHE SAT AND WAITED WITH ALL HER MIGHT AND MAIN MATTHEW ENCOUNTERED THE STATIONMASTER LOCKING UP THE TICKET OFFICE PREPARATORY TO GOING HOME FOR SUPPER AND ASKED HIM IF THE FIVE THIRTY TRAIN WOULD SOON BE ALONG
103-1241-0008 THE FIVE THIRTY TRAIN HAS BEEN IN AND GONE HALF AN HOUR AGO ANSWERED THAT BRISK OFFICIAL BUT THERE WAS A PASSENGER DROPPED OFF FOR YOU A LITTLE GIRL SHE'S SITTING OUT THERE ON THE SHINGLES I ASKED HER TO GO INTO THE LADIES WAITING ROOM BUT SHE INFORMED ME GRAVELY THAT SHE PREFERRED TO STAY OUTSIDE
103-1241-0009 SHE'S A CASE I SHOULD SAY I'M NOT EXPECTING A GIRL SAID MATTHEW BLANKLY IT'S A BOY I'VE COME FOR HE SHOULD BE HERE MISSUS ALEXANDER SPENCER WAS TO BRING HIM OVER FROM NOVA SCOTIA FOR ME THE STATIONMASTER WHISTLED
103-1241-0010 GUESS THERE'S SOME MISTAKE HE SAID MISSUS SPENCER CAME OFF THE TRAIN WITH THAT GIRL AND GAVE HER INTO MY CHARGE SAID YOU AND YOUR SISTER WERE ADOPTING HER FROM AN ORPHAN ASYLUM AND THAT YOU WOULD BE ALONG FOR HER PRESENTLY THAT'S ALL I KNOW ABOUT IT AND I HAVEN'T GOT ANY MORE ORPHANS CONCEALED HEREABOUTS
103-1241-0011 I DON'T UNDERSTAND SAID MATTHEW HELPLESSLY WISHING THAT MARILLA WAS AT HAND TO COPE WITH THE SITUATION WELL YOU'D BETTER QUESTION THE GIRL SAID THE STATION MASTER CARELESSLY I DARE SAY SHE'LL BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN SHE'S GOT A TONGUE OF HER OWN THAT'S CERTAIN
103-1241-0012 MAYBE THEY WERE OUT OF BOYS OF THE BRAND YOU WANTED HE WALKED JAUNTILY AWAY BEING HUNGRY AND THE UNFORTUNATE MATTHEW WAS LEFT TO DO THAT WHICH WAS HARDER FOR HIM THAN BEARDING A LION IN ITS DEN WALK UP TO A GIRL A STRANGE GIRL AN ORPHAN GIRL
103-1241-0013 AND DEMAND OF HER WHY SHE WASN'T A BOY MATTHEW GROANED IN SPIRIT AS HE TURNED ABOUT AND SHUFFLED GENTLY DOWN THE PLATFORM TOWARDS HER SHE HAD BEEN WATCHING HIM EVER SINCE HE HAD PASSED HER AND SHE HAD HER EYES ON HIM NOW MATTHEW WAS NOT LOOKING AT HER
103-1241-0014 A CHILD OF ABOUT ELEVEN GARBED IN A VERY SHORT VERY TIGHT VERY UGLY DRESS OF YELLOWISH GRAY WINCEY SHE WORE A FADED BROWN SAILOR HAT AND BENEATH THE HAT EXTENDING DOWN HER BACK WERE TWO BRAIDS OF VERY THICK DECIDEDLY RED HAIR
103-1241-0015 HER FACE WAS SMALL WHITE AND THIN ALSO MUCH FRECKLED HER MOUTH WAS LARGE AND SO WERE HER EYES WHICH LOOKED GREEN IN SOME LIGHTS AND MOODS AND GRAY IN OTHERS SO FAR THE ORDINARY OBSERVER AN EXTRAORDINARY OBSERVER
103-1241-0016 MIGHT HAVE SEEN THAT THE CHIN WAS VERY POINTED AND PRONOUNCED THAT THE BIG EYES WERE FULL OF SPIRIT AND VIVACITY THAT THE MOUTH WAS SWEET LIPPED AND EXPRESSIVE THAT THE FOREHEAD WAS BROAD AND FULL IN SHORT OUR DISCERNING EXTRAORDINARY OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE CONCLUDED
103-1241-0017 WAS SO LUDICROUSLY AFRAID MATTHEW HOWEVER WAS SPARED THE ORDEAL OF SPEAKING FIRST FOR AS SOON AS SHE CONCLUDED THAT HE WAS COMING TO HER SHE STOOD UP GRASPING WITH ONE THIN BROWN HAND THE HANDLE OF A SHABBY OLD FASHIONED CARPET BAG THE OTHER SHE HELD OUT TO HIM
103-1241-0018 I SUPPOSE YOU ARE MISTER MATTHEW CUTHBERT OF GREEN GABLES SHE SAID IN A PECULIARLY CLEAR SWEET VOICE I'M VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU I WAS BEGINNING TO BE AFRAID YOU WEREN'T COMING FOR ME
103-1241-0019 I HAD MADE UP MY MIND THAT IF YOU DIDN'T COME FOR ME TO NIGHT
103-1241-0020 I WOULDN'T BE A BIT AFRAID AND IT WOULD BE LOVELY TO SLEEP IN A WILD CHERRY TREE ALL WHITE WITH BLOOM IN THE MOONSHINE DON'T YOU THINK YOU COULD IMAGINE YOU WERE DWELLING IN MARBLE HALLS COULDN'T YOU
103-1241-0021 MATTHEW HAD TAKEN THE SCRAWNY LITTLE HAND AWKWARDLY IN HIS THEN AND THERE HE DECIDED WHAT TO DO HE COULD NOT TELL THIS CHILD WITH THE GLOWING EYES THAT THERE HAD BEEN A MISTAKE HE WOULD TAKE HER HOME AND LET MARILLA DO THAT SHE COULDN'T BE LEFT AT BRIGHT RIVER ANYHOW
103-1241-0022 NO MATTER WHAT MISTAKE HAD BEEN MADE SO ALL QUESTIONS AND EXPLANATIONS MIGHT AS WELL BE DEFERRED UNTIL HE WAS SAFELY BACK AT GREEN GABLES I'M SORRY I WAS LATE HE SAID SHYLY COME ALONG THE HORSE IS OVER IN THE YARD GIVE ME YOUR BAG OH I CAN CARRY IT THE CHILD RESPONDED CHEERFULLY
103-1241-0023 IT ISN'T HEAVY I'VE GOT ALL MY WORLDLY GOODS IN IT BUT IT ISN'T HEAVY AND IF IT ISN'T CARRIED IN JUST A CERTAIN WAY THE HANDLE PULLS OUT SO I'D BETTER KEEP IT BECAUSE I KNOW THE EXACT KNACK OF IT IT'S AN EXTREMELY OLD CARPET BAG OH I'M VERY GLAD YOU'VE COME EVEN IF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO SLEEP IN A WILD CHERRY TREE
103-1241-0024 WE'VE GOT TO DRIVE A LONG PIECE HAVEN'T WE MISSUS SPENCER SAID IT WAS EIGHT MILES I'M GLAD BECAUSE I LOVE DRIVING OH IT SEEMS SO WONDERFUL THAT I'M GOING TO LIVE WITH YOU AND BELONG TO YOU I'VE NEVER BELONGED TO ANYBODY NOT REALLY BUT THE ASYLUM WAS THE WORST I'VE ONLY BEEN IN IT FOUR MONTHS BUT THAT WAS ENOUGH
103-1241-0025 IT'S WORSE THAN ANYTHING YOU COULD IMAGINE MISSUS SPENCER SAID IT WAS WICKED OF ME TO TALK LIKE THAT
103-1241-0026 THEY WERE GOOD YOU KNOW THE ASYLUM PEOPLE BUT THERE IS SO LITTLE SCOPE FOR THE IMAGINATION IN AN ASYLUM ONLY JUST IN THE OTHER ORPHANS IT WAS PRETTY INTERESTING TO IMAGINE THINGS ABOUT THEM
103-1241-0027 WHO HAD BEEN STOLEN AWAY FROM HER PARENTS IN HER INFANCY BY A CRUEL NURSE WHO DIED BEFORE SHE COULD CONFESS I USED TO LIE AWAKE AT NIGHTS AND IMAGINE THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE TIME IN THE DAY I GUESS THAT'S WHY I'M SO THIN I AM DREADFUL THIN AIN'T I THERE ISN'T A PICK ON MY BONES
103-1241-0028 I DO LOVE TO IMAGINE I'M NICE AND PLUMP WITH DIMPLES IN MY ELBOWS WITH THIS MATTHEW'S COMPANION STOPPED TALKING PARTLY BECAUSE SHE WAS OUT OF BREATH AND PARTLY BECAUSE THEY HAD REACHED THE BUGGY NOT ANOTHER WORD DID SHE SAY UNTIL THEY HAD LEFT THE VILLAGE AND WERE DRIVING DOWN A STEEP LITTLE HILL
103-1241-0029 THE ROAD PART OF WHICH HAD BEEN CUT SO DEEPLY INTO THE SOFT SOIL THAT THE BANKS FRINGED WITH BLOOMING WILD CHERRY TREES AND SLIM WHITE BIRCHES WERE SEVERAL FEET ABOVE THEIR HEADS THE CHILD PUT OUT HER HAND AND BROKE OFF A BRANCH OF WILD PLUM THAT BRUSHED AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE BUGGY
103-1241-0030 ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL WHAT DID THAT TREE LEANING OUT FROM THE BANK ALL WHITE AND LACY MAKE YOU THINK OF SHE ASKED WELL NOW I DUNNO SAID MATTHEW WHY A BRIDE OF COURSE A BRIDE ALL IN WHITE WITH A LOVELY MISTY VEIL
103-1241-0031 I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE BUT I CAN IMAGINE WHAT SHE WOULD LOOK LIKE I DON'T EVER EXPECT TO BE A BRIDE MYSELF I'M SO HOMELY NOBODY WILL EVER WANT TO MARRY ME UNLESS IT MIGHT BE A FOREIGN MISSIONARY I SUPPOSE A FOREIGN MISSIONARY MIGHTN'T BE VERY PARTICULAR
103-1241-0032 BUT I DO HOPE THAT SOME DAY I SHALL HAVE A WHITE DRESS THAT IS MY HIGHEST IDEAL OF EARTHLY BLISS I JUST LOVE PRETTY CLOTHES AND I'VE NEVER HAD A PRETTY DRESS IN MY LIFE THAT I CAN REMEMBER BUT OF COURSE IT'S ALL THE MORE TO LOOK FORWARD TO ISN'T IT AND THEN
103-1241-0033 I CAN IMAGINE THAT I'M DRESSED GORGEOUSLY THIS MORNING WHEN I LEFT THE ASYLUM I FELT SO ASHAMED BECAUSE I HAD TO WEAR THIS HORRID OLD WINCEY DRESS ALL THE ORPHANS HAD TO WEAR THEM YOU KNOW A MERCHANT IN HOPETON LAST WINTER DONATED THREE HUNDRED YARDS OF WINCEY TO THE ASYLUM SOME PEOPLE SAID IT WAS BECAUSE HE COULDN'T SELL IT
103-1241-0034 BUT I'D RATHER BELIEVE THAT IT WAS OUT OF THE KINDNESS OF HIS HEART WOULDN'T YOU WHEN WE GOT ON THE TRAIN I FELT AS IF EVERYBODY MUST BE LOOKING AT ME AND PITYING ME BUT I JUST WENT TO WORK AND IMAGINED THAT I HAD ON THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PALE BLUE SILK DRESS BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE IMAGINING YOU MIGHT AS WELL IMAGINE SOMETHING WORTH WHILE
103-1241-0035 AND A BIG HAT ALL FLOWERS AND NODDING PLUMES AND A GOLD WATCH AND KID GLOVES AND BOOTS I FELT CHEERED UP RIGHT AWAY AND I ENJOYED MY TRIP TO THE ISLAND WITH ALL MY MIGHT I WASN'T A BIT SICK COMING OVER IN THE BOAT NEITHER WAS MISSUS SPENCER ALTHOUGH SHE GENERALLY IS
103-1241-0036 SHE SAID SHE HADN'T TIME TO GET SICK WATCHING TO SEE THAT I DIDN'T FALL OVERBOARD SHE SAID SHE NEVER SAW THE BEAT OF ME FOR PROWLING ABOUT BUT IF IT KEPT HER FROM BEING SEASICK IT'S A MERCY I DID PROWL ISN'T IT AND I WANTED TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT WAS TO BE SEEN ON THAT BOAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER I'D EVER HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY
103-1241-0037 OH THERE ARE A LOT MORE CHERRY TREES ALL IN BLOOM THIS ISLAND IS THE BLOOMIEST PLACE I JUST LOVE IT ALREADY AND I'M SO GLAD I'M GOING TO LIVE HERE I'VE ALWAYS HEARD THAT PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND WAS THE PRETTIEST PLACE IN THE WORLD
103-1241-0038 AND I USED TO IMAGINE I WAS LIVING HERE BUT I NEVER REALLY EXPECTED I WOULD IT'S DELIGHTFUL WHEN YOUR IMAGINATIONS COME TRUE ISN'T IT BUT THOSE RED ROADS ARE SO FUNNY WHEN WE GOT INTO THE TRAIN AT CHARLOTTETOWN AND THE RED ROADS BEGAN TO FLASH PAST I ASKED MISSUS SPENCER WHAT MADE THEM RED
103-1241-0039 AND SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T KNOW AND FOR PITY'S SAKE NOT TO ASK HER ANY MORE QUESTIONS SHE SAID I MUST HAVE ASKED HER A THOUSAND ALREADY I SUPPOSE I HAD TOO BUT HOW YOU GOING TO FIND OUT ABOUT THINGS IF YOU DON'T ASK QUESTIONS AND WHAT DOES MAKE THE ROADS RED WELL NOW I DUNNO SAID MATTHEW
103-1241-0040 THERE'D BE NO SCOPE FOR IMAGINATION THEN WOULD THERE BUT AM I TALKING TOO MUCH PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS TELLING ME I DO WOULD YOU RATHER I DIDN'T TALK IF YOU SAY SO I'LL STOP I CAN STOP WHEN I MAKE UP MY MIND TO IT ALTHOUGH IT'S DIFFICULT MATTHEW
103-1241-0041 WAS ENJOYING HIMSELF LIKE MOST QUIET FOLKS HE LIKED TALKATIVE PEOPLE WHEN THEY WERE WILLING TO DO THE TALKING THEMSELVES AND DID NOT EXPECT HIM TO KEEP UP HIS END OF IT BUT HE HAD NEVER EXPECTED TO ENJOY THE SOCIETY OF A LITTLE GIRL WOMEN WERE BAD ENOUGH IN ALL CONSCIENCE BUT LITTLE GIRLS WERE WORSE
103-1241-0042 HE DETESTED THE WAY THEY HAD OF SIDLING PAST HIM TIMIDLY WITH SIDEWISE GLANCES AS IF THEY EXPECTED HIM TO GOBBLE THEM UP AT A MOUTHFUL IF THEY VENTURED TO SAY A WORD THAT WAS THE AVONLEA TYPE OF WELL BRED LITTLE GIRL BUT THIS FRECKLED WITCH WAS VERY DIFFERENT
103-1241-0043 AND ALTHOUGH HE FOUND IT RATHER DIFFICULT FOR HIS SLOWER INTELLIGENCE TO KEEP UP WITH HER BRISK MENTAL PROCESSES
1034-121119-0000 CHAPTER NINETY NINE THE LAW WE HAVE SEEN HOW QUIETLY
1034-121119-0001 THE FACT BEING THAT EVERY ONE WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED IN HIS OR HER OWN AFFAIRS TO THINK OF THEIRS WE WILL LEAVE THE BANKER CONTEMPLATING THE ENORMOUS MAGNITUDE OF HIS DEBT BEFORE THE PHANTOM OF BANKRUPTCY AND FOLLOW THE BARONESS
1034-121119-0002 WHO AFTER BEING MOMENTARILY CRUSHED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THE BLOW WHICH HAD STRUCK HER HAD GONE TO SEEK HER USUAL ADVISER LUCIEN DEBRAY THE BARONESS HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO THIS MARRIAGE AS A MEANS OF RIDDING HER OF A GUARDIANSHIP WHICH OVER A GIRL OF EUGENIE'S CHARACTER
1034-121119-0003 FOR IN THE TACIT RELATIONS WHICH MAINTAIN THE BOND OF FAMILY UNION THE MOTHER TO MAINTAIN HER ASCENDANCY OVER HER DAUGHTER MUST NEVER FAIL TO BE A MODEL OF WISDOM AND A TYPE OF PERFECTION NOW
1034-121119-0004 AN EXPRESSION WHICH SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD ALL HER MOTHER'S AMOROUS AND PECUNIARY RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE INTIMATE SECRETARY MOREOVER
1034-121119-0005 NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE WAS A SOURCE OF DISSENSION AND SCANDAL UNDER THE PATERNAL ROOF BUT BECAUSE SHE HAD AT ONCE CLASSED HIM IN THAT CATALOGUE OF BIPEDS WHOM PLATO ENDEAVORS TO WITHDRAW FROM THE APPELLATION OF MEN
1034-121119-0006 UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS WORLD OF OURS EACH PERSON VIEWS THINGS THROUGH A CERTAIN MEDIUM AND SO IS PREVENTED FROM SEEING IN THE SAME LIGHT AS OTHERS AND MADAME DANGLARS THEREFORE VERY MUCH REGRETTED THAT THE MARRIAGE OF EUGENIE HAD NOT TAKEN PLACE
1034-121119-0007 NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE MATCH WAS GOOD AND LIKELY TO INSURE THE HAPPINESS OF HER CHILD BUT BECAUSE IT WOULD ALSO SET HER AT LIBERTY SHE RAN THEREFORE TO DEBRAY WHO AFTER HAVING LIKE THE REST OF PARIS WITNESSED THE CONTRACT SCENE AND THE SCANDAL ATTENDING IT
1034-121119-0008 HAD RETIRED IN HASTE TO HIS CLUB WHERE HE WAS CHATTING WITH SOME FRIENDS UPON THE EVENTS WHICH SERVED AS A SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION FOR THREE FOURTHS OF THAT CITY KNOWN AS THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD AT THE PRECISE TIME WHEN MADAME DANGLARS DRESSED IN BLACK AND CONCEALED IN A LONG VEIL
1034-121119-0009 WAS ASCENDING THE STAIRS LEADING TO DEBRAY'S APARTMENTS
1034-121119-0010 DEBRAY WAS OCCUPIED IN REPELLING THE INSINUATIONS OF A FRIEND WHO TRIED TO PERSUADE HIM
1034-121119-0011 STILL WHEN HE RECOLLECTED THE INDEPENDENT PROUD SPIRIT OF EUGENIE HE POSITIVELY REJECTED IT AS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE THOUGH THE SAME THOUGHT AGAIN CONTINUALLY RECURRED AND FOUND A RESTING PLACE IN HIS HEART TEA PLAY
1034-121119-0012 AND THE CONVERSATION WHICH HAD BECOME INTERESTING DURING THE DISCUSSION OF SUCH SERIOUS AFFAIRS
1034-121119-0013 AWAITED THE RETURN OF DEBRAY IN THE LITTLE GREEN ROOM SEATED BETWEEN TWO BASKETS OF FLOWERS WHICH SHE HAD THAT MORNING SENT AND WHICH IT MUST BE CONFESSED
1034-121119-0014 WITH SO MUCH CARE THAT HIS ABSENCE WAS HALF EXCUSED IN THE EYES OF THE POOR WOMAN AT TWENTY MINUTES OF TWELVE MADAME DANGLARS TIRED OF WAITING RETURNED HOME WOMEN OF A CERTAIN GRADE ARE LIKE PROSPEROUS GRISETTES IN ONE RESPECT THEY SELDOM RETURN HOME AFTER TWELVE O'CLOCK
1034-121119-0015 THE BARONESS RETURNED TO THE HOTEL WITH AS MUCH CAUTION AS EUGENIE USED IN LEAVING IT SHE RAN LIGHTLY UP STAIRS AND WITH AN ACHING HEART ENTERED HER APARTMENT CONTIGUOUS AS WE KNOW TO THAT OF EUGENIE SHE WAS FEARFUL OF EXCITING ANY REMARK
1034-121119-0016 AND BELIEVED FIRMLY IN HER DAUGHTER'S INNOCENCE AND FIDELITY TO THE PATERNAL ROOF SHE LISTENED AT EUGENIE'S DOOR AND HEARING NO SOUND TRIED TO ENTER BUT THE BOLTS WERE IN PLACE MADAME DANGLARS THEN CONCLUDED THAT THE YOUNG GIRL HAD BEEN OVERCOME WITH THE TERRIBLE EXCITEMENT OF THE EVENING
1034-121119-0017 AND HAD GONE TO BED AND TO SLEEP SHE CALLED THE MAID AND QUESTIONED HER MADEMOISELLE EUGENIE SAID THE MAID
1034-121119-0018 AFTER WHICH THEY DESIRED ME TO LEAVE SAYING THAT THEY NEEDED ME NO LONGER
1034-121119-0019 MADAME DANGLARS THEREFORE WENT TO BED WITHOUT A SHADOW OF SUSPICION AND BEGAN TO MUSE OVER THE RECENT EVENTS IN PROPORTION AS HER MEMORY BECAME CLEARER THE OCCURRENCES OF THE EVENING WERE REVEALED IN THEIR TRUE LIGHT WHAT SHE HAD TAKEN FOR CONFUSION WAS A TUMULT
1034-121119-0020 WHO HAD BEEN AFFLICTED WITH AS SEVERE A BLOW THROUGH HER HUSBAND AND SON EUGENIE SHE SAID TO HERSELF IS LOST AND SO ARE WE THE AFFAIR AS IT WILL BE REPORTED WILL COVER US WITH SHAME
1034-121119-0021 FOR IN A SOCIETY SUCH AS OURS SATIRE INFLICTS A PAINFUL AND INCURABLE WOUND
1034-121119-0022 AND HER GLANCE WAS TURNED TOWARDS HEAVEN
1034-121119-0023 AND OUT OF A FAULT NAY EVEN A VICE SOMETIMES PRODUCES A BLESSING AND THEN HER THOUGHTS CLEAVING THROUGH SPACE LIKE A BIRD IN THE AIR RESTED ON CAVALCANTI THIS ANDREA WAS A WRETCH A ROBBER AN ASSASSIN
1034-121119-0024 AND YET HIS MANNERS SHOWED THE EFFECTS OF A SORT OF EDUCATION IF NOT A COMPLETE ONE
1034-121119-0025 SUPPORTED BY AN HONORABLE NAME HOW COULD SHE EXTRICATE HERSELF FROM THIS LABYRINTH TO WHOM WOULD SHE APPLY TO HELP HER OUT OF THIS PAINFUL SITUATION DEBRAY TO WHOM SHE HAD RUN WITH THE FIRST INSTINCT OF A WOMAN TOWARDS THE MAN SHE LOVES AND WHO YET BETRAYS HER
1034-121119-0026 DEBRAY COULD BUT GIVE HER ADVICE SHE MUST APPLY TO SOME ONE MORE POWERFUL THAN HE
1034-121119-0027 BUT NO ON REFLECTION THE PROCUREUR WAS NOT A MERCILESS MAN AND IT WAS NOT THE MAGISTRATE SLAVE TO HIS DUTIES BUT THE FRIEND THE LOYAL FRIEND WHO ROUGHLY BUT FIRMLY CUT INTO THE VERY CORE OF THE CORRUPTION
1034-121119-0028 IT WAS NOT THE EXECUTIONER BUT THE SURGEON WHO WISHED TO WITHDRAW THE HONOR OF DANGLARS FROM IGNOMINIOUS ASSOCIATION WITH THE DISGRACED YOUNG MAN THEY HAD PRESENTED TO THE WORLD AS THEIR SON IN LAW AND SINCE VILLEFORT THE FRIEND OF DANGLARS HAD ACTED IN THIS WAY
1034-121119-0029 NO ONE COULD SUPPOSE THAT HE HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ACQUAINTED WITH OR HAD LENT HIMSELF TO ANY OF ANDREA'S INTRIGUES
1034-121119-0030 APPEARED TO THE BARONESS AS IF SHAPED FOR THEIR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE BUT THE INFLEXIBILITY OF THE PROCUREUR SHOULD STOP THERE SHE WOULD SEE HIM THE NEXT DAY AND IF SHE COULD NOT MAKE HIM FAIL IN HIS DUTIES AS A MAGISTRATE SHE WOULD AT LEAST
1034-121119-0031 OBTAIN ALL THE INDULGENCE HE COULD ALLOW SHE WOULD INVOKE THE PAST RECALL OLD RECOLLECTIONS SHE WOULD SUPPLICATE HIM BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF GUILTY YET HAPPY DAYS
1034-121119-0032 HE HAD ONLY TO TURN HIS EYES ON ONE SIDE AND ALLOW ANDREA TO FLY AND FOLLOW UP THE CRIME UNDER THAT SHADOW OF GUILT CALLED CONTEMPT OF COURT AND AFTER THIS REASONING SHE SLEPT EASILY
1034-121119-0033 AT NINE O'CLOCK NEXT MORNING SHE AROSE AND WITHOUT RINGING FOR HER MAID OR GIVING THE LEAST SIGN OF HER ACTIVITY SHE DRESSED HERSELF IN THE SAME SIMPLE STYLE AS ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT THEN RUNNING DOWN STAIRS SHE LEFT THE HOTEL WALKED TO THE RUE DE PROVENCE
1034-121119-0034 FOR THE LAST MONTH THIS WRETCHED HOUSE HAD PRESENTED THE GLOOMY APPEARANCE OF A LAZARETTO INFECTED WITH THE PLAGUE SOME OF THE APARTMENTS WERE CLOSED WITHIN AND WITHOUT THE SHUTTERS WERE ONLY OPENED TO ADMIT A MINUTE'S AIR SHOWING THE SCARED FACE OF A FOOTMAN
1034-121119-0035 AND THE NEIGHBORS WOULD SAY TO EACH OTHER IN A LOW VOICE
1034-121119-0036 MADAME DANGLARS INVOLUNTARILY SHUDDERED AT THE DESOLATE ASPECT OF THE MANSION
1034-121119-0037 THREE TIMES DID THE BELL RING WITH A DULL HEAVY SOUND SEEMING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GENERAL SADNESS BEFORE THE CONCIERGE APPEARED AND PEEPED THROUGH THE DOOR WHICH HE OPENED JUST WIDE ENOUGH TO ALLOW HIS WORDS TO BE HEARD

1040-133433-0001 THEY WENT UP BY THE STAIR BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THIS WOULD MAKE A BETTER IMPRESSION THEY STOOD IN A ROW IN FRONT OF MISSUS DARLING WITH THEIR HATS OFF AND WISHING THEY WERE NOT WEARING THEIR PIRATE CLOTHES THEY SAID NOTHING BUT THEIR EYES ASKED HER TO HAVE THEM
1040-133433-0002 BUT THEY FORGOT ABOUT HIM OF COURSE MISSUS DARLING SAID AT ONCE THAT SHE WOULD HAVE THEM BUT MISTER DARLING WAS CURIOUSLY DEPRESSED AND THEY SAW THAT HE CONSIDERED SIX A RATHER LARGE NUMBER I MUST SAY HE SAID TO WENDY
1040-133433-0003 THAT YOU DON'T DO THINGS BY HALVES A GRUDGING REMARK WHICH THE TWINS THOUGHT WAS POINTED AT THEM THE FIRST TWIN WAS THE PROUD ONE AND HE ASKED FLUSHING DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE TOO MUCH OF A HANDFUL SIR BECAUSE IF SO WE CAN GO AWAY

1040-133433-0005 GEORGE MISSUS DARLING EXCLAIMED PAINED TO SEE HER DEAR ONE SHOWING HIMSELF IN SUCH AN UNFAVOURABLE LIGHT THEN HE BURST INTO TEARS AND THE TRUTH CAME OUT HE WAS AS GLAD TO HAVE THEM AS SHE WAS HE SAID
1040-133433-0006 BUT HE THOUGHT THEY SHOULD HAVE ASKED HIS CONSENT AS WELL AS HERS
1040-133433-0007 I DON'T THINK HE IS A CYPHER TOOTLES CRIED INSTANTLY DO YOU THINK HE IS A CYPHER CURLY NO I DON'T DO YOU THINK HE IS A CYPHER SLIGHTLY RATHER NOT TWIN WHAT DO YOU THINK
1040-133433-0008 IT TURNED OUT THAT NOT ONE OF THEM THOUGHT HIM A CYPHER AND HE WAS ABSURDLY GRATIFIED AND SAID HE WOULD FIND SPACE FOR THEM ALL IN THE DRAWING ROOM IF THEY FITTED IN WE'LL FIT IN SIR THEY ASSURED HIM THEN FOLLOW THE LEADER HE CRIED GAILY
1040-133433-0009 MIND YOU I AM NOT SURE THAT WE HAVE A DRAWING ROOM BUT WE PRETEND WE HAVE AND IT'S ALL THE SAME HOOP LA HE WENT OFF DANCING THROUGH THE HOUSE AND THEY ALL CRIED HOOP LA AND DANCED AFTER HIM SEARCHING FOR THE DRAWING ROOM AND I FORGET WHETHER THEY FOUND IT
1040-133433-0010 BUT AT ANY RATE THEY FOUND CORNERS AND THEY ALL FITTED IN AS FOR PETER HE SAW WENDY ONCE AGAIN BEFORE HE FLEW AWAY HE DID NOT EXACTLY COME TO THE WINDOW BUT HE BRUSHED AGAINST IT IN PASSING SO THAT SHE COULD OPEN IT IF SHE LIKED AND CALL TO HIM
1040-133433-0011 THAT IS WHAT SHE DID HULLO WENDY GOOD BYE HE SAID OH DEAR ARE YOU GOING AWAY YES YOU DON'T FEEL PETER SHE SAID FALTERINGLY
1040-133433-0012 THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY ANYTHING TO MY PARENTS ABOUT A VERY SWEET SUBJECT NO ABOUT ME PETER NO MISSUS DARLING CAME TO THE WINDOW

1040-133433-0018 I SHALL HAVE TINK TINK CAN'T GO A TWENTIETH PART OF THE WAY ROUND SHE REMINDED HIM A LITTLE TARTLY
1040-133433-0019 TINK CALLED OUT FROM SOMEWHERE ROUND THE CORNER IT DOESN'T MATTER PETER SAID O PETER YOU KNOW IT MATTERS

1040-133433-0021 LONG IN COMING BUT THIS PROMISE SENT PETER AWAY QUITE GAY AGAIN
1040-133433-0022 I SUPPOSE IT WAS BECAUSE WENDY KNEW THIS THAT HER LAST WORDS TO HIM WERE THESE RATHER PLAINTIVE ONES YOU WON'T FORGET ME PETER WILL YOU BEFORE SPRING CLEANING TIME COMES OF COURSE PETER PROMISED AND THEN HE FLEW AWAY HE TOOK MISSUS DARLING'S KISS WITH HIM
1040-133433-0023 THE KISS THAT HAD BEEN FOR NO ONE ELSE PETER TOOK QUITE EASILY FUNNY BUT SHE SEEMED SATISFIED OF COURSE ALL THE BOYS WENT TO SCHOOL
1040-133433-0024 BUT IT WAS TOO LATE NOW AND SOON THEY SETTLED DOWN TO BEING AS ORDINARY AS YOU OR ME OR JENKINS MINOR
1040-133433-0025 IN TIME THEY COULD NOT EVEN FLY AFTER THEIR HATS WANT OF PRACTICE THEY CALLED IT BUT WHAT IT REALLY MEANT WAS THAT THEY NO LONGER BELIEVED MICHAEL BELIEVED LONGER THAN THE OTHER BOYS
1040-133433-0026 THOUGH THEY JEERED AT HIM SO HE WAS WITH WENDY WHEN PETER CAME FOR HER AT THE END OF THE FIRST YEAR SHE FLEW AWAY WITH PETER IN THE FROCK SHE HAD WOVEN FROM LEAVES AND BERRIES IN THE NEVERLAND AND HER ONE FEAR WAS THAT HE MIGHT NOTICE HOW SHORT IT HAD BECOME BUT HE NEVER NOTICED HE HAD SO MUCH TO SAY ABOUT HIMSELF
1040-133433-0027 SHE HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO THRILLING TALKS WITH HIM ABOUT OLD TIMES BUT NEW ADVENTURES HAD CROWDED THE OLD ONES FROM HIS MIND WHO IS CAPTAIN HOOK
1040-133433-0028 WHEN SHE SPOKE OF THE ARCH ENEMY DON'T YOU REMEMBER SHE ASKED AMAZED HOW YOU KILLED HIM AND SAVED ALL OUR LIVES I FORGET THEM AFTER I KILL THEM HE REPLIED CARELESSLY WHEN SHE EXPRESSED A DOUBTFUL HOPE THAT TINKER BELL WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE HER HE SAID
1040-133433-0029 WHO IS TINKER BELL O PETER SHE SAID SHOCKED BUT EVEN WHEN SHE EXPLAINED HE COULD NOT REMEMBER THERE ARE SUCH A LOT OF THEM HE SAID I EXPECT SHE IS NO MORE I EXPECT HE WAS RIGHT FOR FAIRIES DON'T LIVE LONG
1040-133433-0030 BUT THEY ARE SO LITTLE THAT A SHORT TIME SEEMS A GOOD WHILE TO THEM WENDY WAS PAINED TOO TO FIND THAT THE PAST YEAR WAS BUT AS YESTERDAY TO PETER
1040-133433-0031 BUT HE WAS EXACTLY AS FASCINATING AS EVER AND THEY HAD A LOVELY SPRING CLEANING IN THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE TREE TOPS NEXT YEAR HE DID NOT COME FOR HER SHE WAITED IN A NEW FROCK BECAUSE THE OLD ONE SIMPLY WOULD NOT MEET BUT HE NEVER CAME
1040-133433-0032 PERHAPS HE IS ILL MICHAEL SAID YOU KNOW HE IS NEVER ILL MICHAEL CAME CLOSE TO HER AND WHISPERED WITH A SHIVER PERHAPS THERE IS NO SUCH PERSON WENDY AND THEN WENDY WOULD HAVE CRIED IF MICHAEL HAD NOT BEEN CRYING
1040-133433-0033 PETER CAME NEXT SPRING CLEANING AND THE STRANGE THING WAS THAT HE NEVER KNEW HE HAD MISSED A YEAR THAT WAS THE LAST TIME THE GIRL WENDY EVER SAW HIM FOR A LITTLE LONGER SHE TRIED FOR HIS SAKE NOT TO HAVE GROWING PAINS
1040-133433-0034 AND SHE FELT SHE WAS UNTRUE TO HIM WHEN SHE GOT A PRIZE FOR GENERAL KNOWLEDGE BUT THE YEARS CAME AND WENT WITHOUT BRINGING THE CARELESS BOY AND WHEN THEY MET AGAIN WENDY WAS A MARRIED WOMAN AND PETER WAS NO MORE TO HER
1040-133433-0035 THAN A LITTLE DUST IN THE BOX IN WHICH SHE HAD KEPT HER TOYS WENDY WAS GROWN UP YOU NEED NOT BE SORRY FOR HER SHE WAS ONE OF THE KIND THAT LIKES TO GROW UP IN THE END SHE GREW UP OF HER OWN FREE WILL A DAY QUICKER THAN OTHER GIRLS
1040-133433-0036 ALL THE BOYS WERE GROWN UP AND DONE FOR BY THIS TIME SO IT IS SCARCELY WORTH WHILE SAYING ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THEM YOU MAY SEE THE TWINS AND NIBS AND CURLY ANY DAY GOING TO AN OFFICE EACH CARRYING A LITTLE BAG AND AN UMBRELLA
1040-133433-0037 YOU SEE THAT JUDGE IN A WIG COMING OUT AT THE IRON DOOR THAT USED TO BE TOOTLES THE BEARDED MAN WHO DOESN'T KNOW ANY STORY TO TELL HIS CHILDREN
1040-133433-0038 AND ALWAYS HAD AN ODD INQUIRING LOOK
1040-133433-0039 WHEN SHE WAS OLD ENOUGH TO ASK THEM THEY WERE MOSTLY ABOUT PETER PAN SHE LOVED TO HEAR OF PETER AND WENDY TOLD HER ALL SHE COULD REMEMBER IN THE VERY NURSERY FROM WHICH THE FAMOUS FLIGHT HAD TAKEN PLACE
1040-133433-0040 WHO WAS NO LONGER FOND OF STAIRS MISSUS DARLING WAS NOW DEAD AND FORGOTTEN THERE WERE ONLY TWO BEDS IN THE NURSERY NOW JANE'S AND HER NURSE'S AND THERE WAS NO KENNEL FOR NANA ALSO HAD PASSED AWAY
1040-133433-0041 SHE DIED OF OLD AGE AND AT THE END SHE HAD BEEN RATHER DIFFICULT TO GET ON WITH BEING VERY FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT NO ONE KNEW HOW TO LOOK AFTER CHILDREN EXCEPT HERSELF ONCE A WEEK JANE'S NURSE HAD HER EVENING OFF
1040-133433-0042 AND THEN IT WAS WENDY'S PART TO PUT JANE TO BED THAT WAS THE TIME FOR STORIES IT WAS JANE'S INVENTION TO RAISE THE SHEET OVER HER MOTHER'S HEAD AND HER OWN THUS MAKING A TENT
1040-133433-0043 I DON'T THINK I SEE ANYTHING TO NIGHT SAYS WENDY WITH A FEELING THAT IF NANA WERE HERE SHE WOULD OBJECT TO FURTHER CONVERSATION YES YOU DO SAYS JANE
1040-133433-0044 THAT IS A LONG TIME AGO SWEETHEART SAYS WENDY AH ME HOW TIME FLIES DOES IT FLY ASKS THE ARTFUL CHILD THE WAY YOU FLEW WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL
1040-133433-0045 WHY CAN'T YOU FLY NOW MOTHER BECAUSE I AM GROWN UP DEAREST WHEN PEOPLE GROW UP THEY FORGET THE WAY WHY DO THEY FORGET THE WAY BECAUSE THEY ARE NO LONGER GAY AND INNOCENT AND HEARTLESS
1040-133433-0046 IT IS ONLY THE GAY AND INNOCENT AND HEARTLESS WHO CAN FLY WHAT IS GAY AND INNOCENT AND HEARTLESS
1040-133433-0047 OR PERHAPS WENDY ADMITS SHE DOES SEE SOMETHING I DO BELIEVE SHE SAYS THAT IT IS THIS NURSERY I DO BELIEVE IT IS SAYS JANE GO ON
1040-133433-0048 THEY ARE NOW EMBARKED ON THE GREAT ADVENTURE OF THE NIGHT WHEN PETER FLEW IN LOOKING FOR HIS SHADOW
1040-133433-0049 YOU HAVE MISSED A BIT INTERRUPTS JANE WHO NOW KNOWS THE STORY BETTER THAN HER MOTHER WHEN YOU SAW HIM SITTING ON THE FLOOR CRYING WHAT DID YOU SAY I SAT UP IN BED AND I SAID BOY WHY ARE YOU CRYING
1040-133433-0050 YES THAT WAS IT SAYS JANE WITH A BIG BREATH AND THEN HE FLEW US ALL AWAY TO THE NEVERLAND AND THE FAIRIES AND THE PIRATES AND THE REDSKINS AND THE MERMAID'S LAGOON
1040-133433-0051 YES WHICH DID YOU LIKE BEST OF ALL I THINK I LIKED THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND BEST OF ALL
1040-133433-0052 WHAT WAS THE LAST THING PETER EVER SAID TO YOU THE LAST THING HE EVER SAID TO ME WAS JUST ALWAYS BE WAITING FOR ME AND THEN SOME NIGHT YOU WILL HEAR ME CROWING YES BUT ALAS HE FORGOT ALL ABOUT ME
1040-133433-0053 WENDY SAID IT WITH A SMILE SHE WAS AS GROWN UP AS THAT WHAT DID HIS CROW SOUND LIKE JANE ASKED ONE EVENING IT WAS LIKE THIS WENDY SAID
1040-133433-0054 TRYING TO IMITATE PETER'S CROW NO IT WASN'T JANE SAID GRAVELY
1040-133433-0055 JANE SAID AH YES MANY GIRLS HEAR IT WHEN THEY ARE SLEEPING BUT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO HEARD IT AWAKE LUCKY YOU SAID JANE AND THEN ONE NIGHT CAME THE TRAGEDY IT WAS THE SPRING OF THE YEAR
1040-133433-0056 WENDY WAS SITTING ON THE FLOOR VERY CLOSE TO THE FIRE SO AS TO SEE TO DARN FOR THERE WAS NO OTHER LIGHT IN THE NURSERY AND WHILE SHE SAT DARNING SHE HEARD A CROW THEN THE WINDOW BLEW OPEN AS OF OLD
1040-133433-0057 HE WAS EXACTLY THE SAME AS EVER AND WENDY SAW AT ONCE THAT HE STILL HAD ALL HIS FIRST TEETH HE WAS A LITTLE BOY AND SHE WAS GROWN UP SHE HUDDLED BY THE FIRE NOT DARING TO MOVE HELPLESS AND GUILTY
1040-133433-0058 A BIG WOMAN HULLO WENDY HE SAID NOT NOTICING ANY DIFFERENCE FOR HE WAS THINKING CHIEFLY OF HIMSELF AND IN THE DIM LIGHT HER WHITE DRESS MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE NIGHTGOWN IN WHICH HE HAD SEEN HER FIRST HULLO PETER
1040-133433-0059 SHE REPLIED FAINTLY SQUEEZING HERSELF AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE SOMETHING INSIDE HER WAS CRYING WOMAN WOMAN LET GO OF ME HULLO WHERE IS JOHN HE ASKED SUDDENLY MISSING THE THIRD BED
1040-133433-0060 JOHN IS NOT HERE NOW SHE GASPED IS MICHAEL ASLEEP HE ASKED WITH A CARELESS GLANCE AT JANE
1040-133433-0061 THAT IS NOT MICHAEL SHE SAID QUICKLY LEST A JUDGMENT SHOULD FALL ON HER PETER LOOKED HULLO IS IT A NEW ONE YES BOY OR GIRL GIRL NOW SURELY HE WOULD UNDERSTAND BUT NOT A BIT OF IT
1040-133433-0062 PETER SHE SAID FALTERING ARE YOU EXPECTING ME TO FLY AWAY WITH YOU OF COURSE THAT IS WHY I HAVE COME HE ADDED A LITTLE STERNLY HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THAT THIS IS SPRING CLEANING TIME
1040-133433-0063 SHE KNEW IT WAS USELESS TO SAY THAT HE HAD LET MANY SPRING CLEANING TIMES PASS I CAN'T COME SHE SAID APOLOGETICALLY I HAVE FORGOTTEN HOW TO FLY I'LL SOON TEACH YOU AGAIN O PETER DON'T WASTE THE FAIRY DUST ON ME
1040-133433-0064 WHAT IS IT HE CRIED SHRINKING
1040-133433-0065 FOR ALMOST THE ONLY TIME IN HIS LIFE THAT I KNOW OF PETER WAS AFRAID DON'T TURN UP THE LIGHT HE CRIED SHE LET HER HANDS PLAY IN THE HAIR OF THE TRAGIC BOY SHE WAS NOT A LITTLE GIRL HEART BROKEN ABOUT HIM
1040-133433-0066 SHE WAS A GROWN WOMAN SMILING AT IT ALL
1040-133433-0067 THEN SHE TURNED UP THE LIGHT AND PETER SAW HE GAVE A CRY OF PAIN AND WHEN THE TALL BEAUTIFUL CREATURE STOOPED TO LIFT HIM IN HER ARMS HE DREW BACK SHARPLY WHAT IS IT HE CRIED AGAIN SHE HAD TO TELL HIM
1040-133433-0068 I AM OLD PETER I AM EVER SO MUCH MORE THAN TWENTY I GREW UP LONG AGO YOU PROMISED NOT TO I COULDN'T HELP IT
1040-133433-0069 NO YOU'RE NOT YES AND THE LITTLE GIRL IN THE BED IS MY BABY NO SHE'S NOT
1040-133433-0070 OF COURSE HE DID NOT STRIKE
1040-133433-0071 AND WENDY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO COMFORT HIM THOUGH SHE COULD HAVE DONE IT SO EASILY ONCE SHE WAS ONLY A WOMAN NOW AND SHE RAN OUT OF THE ROOM TO TRY TO THINK PETER CONTINUED TO CRY AND SOON HIS SOBS WOKE JANE
1040-133433-0072 BOY SHE SAID WHY ARE YOU CRYING PETER ROSE AND BOWED TO HER AND SHE BOWED TO HIM FROM THE BED HULLO HE SAID HULLO SAID JANE MY NAME IS PETER PAN HE TOLD HER
1040-133433-0073 YES I KNOW I CAME BACK FOR MY MOTHER HE EXPLAINED TO TAKE HER TO THE NEVERLAND YES I KNOW JANE SAID I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU WHEN WENDY RETURNED DIFFIDENTLY SHE FOUND PETER SITTING ON THE BED POST CROWING GLORIOUSLY
1040-133433-0074 WHILE JANE IN HER NIGHTY WAS FLYING ROUND THE ROOM IN SOLEMN ECSTASY SHE IS MY MOTHER PETER EXPLAINED AND JANE DESCENDED AND STOOD BY HIS SIDE WITH THE LOOK IN HER FACE THAT HE LIKED TO SEE ON LADIES WHEN THEY GAZED AT HIM
1040-133433-0075 HE DOES SO NEED A MOTHER JANE SAID YES I KNOW WENDY ADMITTED RATHER FORLORNLY NO ONE KNOWS IT SO WELL AS I GOOD BYE SAID PETER TO WENDY AND HE ROSE IN THE AIR AND THE SHAMELESS JANE ROSE WITH HIM
1040-133433-0076 IT WAS ALREADY HER EASIEST WAY OF MOVING ABOUT WENDY RUSHED TO THE WINDOW NO NO SHE CRIED IT IS JUST FOR SPRING CLEANING TIME JANE SAID HE WANTS ME ALWAYS TO DO HIS SPRING CLEANING
1040-133433-0077 IF ONLY I COULD GO WITH YOU WENDY SIGHED YOU SEE YOU CAN'T FLY SAID JANE OF COURSE IN THE END WENDY LET THEM FLY AWAY TOGETHER
1040-133433-0078 OUR LAST GLIMPSE OF HER SHOWS HER AT THE WINDOW
1040-133433-0079 AS YOU LOOK AT WENDY YOU MAY SEE HER HAIR BECOMING WHITE AND HER FIGURE LITTLE AGAIN FOR ALL THIS HAPPENED LONG AGO
1040-133433-0080 AND EVERY SPRING CLEANING TIME EXCEPT WHEN HE FORGETS PETER COMES FOR MARGARET AND TAKES HER TO THE NEVERLAND WHERE SHE TELLS HIM STORIES ABOUT HIMSELF TO WHICH HE LISTENS EAGERLY WHEN MARGARET GROWS UP SHE WILL HAVE A DAUGHTER WHO IS TO BE PETER'S MOTHER IN TURN
1069-133699-0000 HE TOOK A RESOLVE AFTER THIS NOT TO MISINTERPRET HER WORDS EVEN WHEN MISS STACKPOLE APPEARED TO STRIKE THE PERSONAL NOTE MOST STRONGLY HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF THAT PERSONS IN HER VIEW WERE SIMPLE AND HOMOGENEOUS ORGANISMS
1069-133699-0001 TO DEAL WITH HER IN STRICT RECIPROCITY HE CARRIED OUT HIS RESOLVE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF TACT AND THE YOUNG LADY FOUND IN RENEWED CONTACT WITH HIM NO OBSTACLE TO THE EXERCISE OF HER GENIUS FOR UNSHRINKING ENQUIRY
1069-133699-0002 THE GENERAL APPLICATION OF HER CONFIDENCE HER SITUATION AT GARDENCOURT THEREFORE APPRECIATED AS WE HAVE SEEN HER TO BE BY ISABEL AND FULL OF APPRECIATION HERSELF OF THAT FREE PLAY OF INTELLIGENCE
1069-133699-0003 SHE PRESENTLY DISCOVERED IN TRUTH THAT THIS OBLIGATION WAS OF THE LIGHTEST AND THAT MISSUS TOUCHETT CARED VERY LITTLE HOW MISS STACKPOLE BEHAVED MISSUS TOUCHETT HAD DEFINED HER TO ISABEL
1069-133699-0004 AS BOTH AN ADVENTURESS AND A BORE ADVENTURESSES USUALLY GIVING ONE MORE OF A THRILL SHE HAD EXPRESSED SOME SURPRISE AT HER NIECE'S HAVING SELECTED SUCH A FRIEND
1069-133699-0005 YET HAD IMMEDIATELY ADDED THAT SHE KNEW ISABEL'S FRIENDS WERE HER OWN AFFAIR AND THAT SHE HAD NEVER UNDERTAKEN TO LIKE THEM ALL OR TO RESTRICT THE GIRL TO THOSE SHE LIKED
1069-133699-0006 MY DEAR YOU'D HAVE A VERY SMALL SOCIETY MISSUS TOUCHETT FRANKLY ADMITTED AND I DON'T THINK I LIKE ANY MAN OR WOMAN WELL ENOUGH TO RECOMMEND THEM TO YOU WHEN IT COMES TO RECOMMENDING IT'S A SERIOUS AFFAIR
1069-133699-0007 I DON'T LIKE MISS STACKPOLE EVERYTHING ABOUT HER DISPLEASES ME SHE TALKS SO MUCH TOO LOUD AND LOOKS AT ONE AS IF ONE WANTED TO LOOK AT HER WHICH ONE DOESN'T
1069-133699-0008 I'M SURE SHE HAS LIVED ALL HER LIFE IN A BOARDING HOUSE AND I DETEST THE MANNERS AND THE LIBERTIES OF SUCH PLACES IF YOU ASK ME IF I PREFER MY OWN MANNERS WHICH YOU DOUBTLESS THINK VERY BAD I'LL TELL YOU THAT I PREFER THEM IMMENSELY
1069-133699-0009 AND SHE DETESTS ME FOR DETESTING IT
1069-133699-0010 MISSUS TOUCHETT WAS RIGHT IN GUESSING THAT HENRIETTA DISAPPROVED OF HER BUT SHE HAD NOT QUITE PUT HER FINGER ON THE REASON A DAY OR TWO AFTER MISS STACKPOLE'S ARRIVAL
1069-133699-0011 WHICH EXCITED A VEIN OF COUNTER ARGUMENT ON THE PART OF THE CORRESPONDENT OF THE INTERVIEWER WHO IN THE EXERCISE OF HER PROFESSION HAD ACQUAINTED HERSELF IN THE WESTERN WORLD WITH EVERY FORM OF CARAVANSARY
1069-133699-0012 RALPH WITH HIS EXPERIMENTAL GENIALITY SUGGESTED BY WAY OF HEALING THE BREACH THAT THE TRUTH LAY BETWEEN THE TWO EXTREMES AND THAT THE ESTABLISHMENTS IN QUESTION OUGHT TO BE DESCRIBED AS FAIR MIDDLING
1069-133699-0013 THIS CONTRIBUTION TO THE DISCUSSION HOWEVER MISS STACKPOLE REJECTED WITH SCORN MIDDLING INDEED IF THEY WERE NOT THE BEST IN THE WORLD THEY WERE THE WORST BUT THERE WAS NOTHING MIDDLING ABOUT AN AMERICAN HOTEL
1069-133699-0014 I LIKE TO BE TREATED AS AN AMERICAN LADY POOR AMERICAN LADIES CRIED MISSUS TOUCHETT WITH A LAUGH THEY'RE THE SLAVES OF SLAVES THEY'RE THE COMPANIONS OF FREEMEN HENRIETTA RETORTED
1069-133699-0015 THEY'RE THE COMPANIONS OF THEIR SERVANTS THE IRISH CHAMBERMAID AND THE NEGRO WAITER THEY SHARE THEIR WORK DO YOU CALL THE DOMESTICS IN AN AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD SLAVES MISS STACKPOLE ENQUIRED
1069-133699-0016 IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU DESIRE TO TREAT THEM NO WONDER YOU DON'T LIKE AMERICA IF YOU'VE NOT GOOD SERVANTS YOU'RE MISERABLE MISSUS TOUCHETT SERENELY SAID THEY'RE VERY BAD IN AMERICA BUT I'VE FIVE PERFECT ONES IN FLORENCE
1069-133699-0017 I DON'T SEE WHAT YOU WANT WITH FIVE HENRIETTA COULDN'T HELP OBSERVING I DON'T THINK I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE FIVE PERSONS SURROUNDING ME IN THAT MENIAL POSITION
1069-133699-0018 SHOULD YOU LIKE ME BETTER IF I WERE YOUR BUTLER DEAR HER HUSBAND ASKED I DON'T THINK I SHOULD YOU WOULDN'T AT ALL HAVE THE TENUE THE COMPANIONS OF FREEMEN I LIKE THAT MISS STACKPOLE SAID RALPH
1069-133699-0019 IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DESCRIPTION WHEN I SAID FREEMEN I DIDN'T MEAN YOU SIR AND THIS WAS THE ONLY REWARD THAT RALPH GOT FOR HIS COMPLIMENT MISS STACKPOLE WAS BAFFLED
1069-133699-0020 WHICH SHE PRIVATELY JUDGED TO BE A MYSTERIOUS SURVIVAL OF FEUDALISM IT WAS PERHAPS BECAUSE HER MIND WAS OPPRESSED WITH THIS IMAGE THAT SHE SUFFERED SOME DAYS TO ELAPSE BEFORE SHE TOOK OCCASION TO SAY TO ISABEL
1069-133699-0021 MY DEAR FRIEND I WONDER IF YOU'RE GROWING FAITHLESS FAITHLESS FAITHLESS TO YOU HENRIETTA NO THAT WOULD BE A GREAT PAIN BUT IT'S NOT THAT FAITHLESS TO MY COUNTRY THEN
1069-133699-0022 THAT I HOPE WILL NEVER BE WHEN I WROTE TO YOU FROM LIVERPOOL I SAID I HAD SOMETHING PARTICULAR TO TELL YOU YOU'VE NEVER ASKED ME WHAT IT IS IS IT BECAUSE YOU'VE SUSPECTED SUSPECTED WHAT
1069-133699-0023 YOU DON'T ASK THAT RIGHT AS IF YOU THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT YOU'RE CHANGED YOU'RE THINKING OF OTHER THINGS TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN AND I'LL THINK OF THAT WILL YOU REALLY THINK OF IT THAT'S WHAT I WISH TO BE SURE OF
1069-133699-0024 I'VE NOT MUCH CONTROL OF MY THOUGHTS BUT I'LL DO MY BEST SAID ISABEL HENRIETTA GAZED AT HER IN SILENCE FOR A PERIOD WHICH TRIED ISABEL'S PATIENCE SO THAT OUR HEROINE ADDED AT LAST
1069-133699-0025 ISABEL RESPONDED YOU SAY THAT RIGHT I HAD A GOOD DEAL OF TALK WITH HIM HE HAS COME AFTER YOU DID HE TELL YOU SO NO HE TOLD ME NOTHING THAT'S HOW I KNEW IT SAID HENRIETTA CLEVERLY
1069-133699-0026 HE SAID VERY LITTLE ABOUT YOU BUT I SPOKE OF YOU A GOOD DEAL ISABEL WAITED AT THE MENTION OF MISTER GOODWOOD'S NAME SHE HAD TURNED A LITTLE PALE I'M VERY SORRY YOU DID THAT SHE OBSERVED AT LAST
1069-133699-0027 I COULD HAVE TALKED A LONG TIME TO SUCH A LISTENER HE WAS SO QUIET SO INTENSE HE DRANK IT ALL IN WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT ME ISABEL ASKED I SAID YOU WERE ON THE WHOLE THE FINEST CREATURE I KNOW
1069-133699-0028 WHILE I TALKED I NEVER SAW AN UGLY MAN LOOK SO HANDSOME HE'S VERY SIMPLE MINDED SAID ISABEL AND HE'S NOT SO UGLY THERE'S NOTHING SO SIMPLIFYING AS A GRAND PASSION
1069-133699-0029 IT'S NOT A GRAND PASSION I'M VERY SURE IT'S NOT THAT YOU DON'T SAY THAT AS IF YOU WERE SURE ISABEL GAVE RATHER A COLD SMILE I SHALL SAY IT BETTER TO MISTER GOODWOOD HIMSELF
1069-133699-0030 ISABEL OFFERED NO ANSWER TO THIS ASSERTION WHICH HER COMPANION MADE WITH AN AIR OF GREAT CONFIDENCE HE'LL FIND YOU CHANGED THE LATTER PURSUED YOU'VE BEEN AFFECTED BY YOUR NEW SURROUNDINGS VERY LIKELY I'M AFFECTED BY EVERYTHING
1069-133699-0031 BY EVERYTHING BUT MISTER GOODWOOD MISS STACKPOLE EXCLAIMED WITH A SLIGHTLY HARSH HILARITY ISABEL FAILED EVEN TO SMILE BACK AND IN A MOMENT SHE SAID DID HE ASK YOU TO SPEAK TO ME NOT IN SO MANY WORDS
1069-133699-0032 BUT HIS EYES ASKED IT AND HIS HANDSHAKE WHEN HE BADE ME GOOD BYE THANK YOU FOR DOING SO AND ISABEL TURNED AWAY YES YOU'RE CHANGED YOU'VE GOT NEW IDEAS OVER HERE HER FRIEND CONTINUED I HOPE SO SAID ISABEL
1069-133699-0033 ONE SHOULD GET AS MANY NEW IDEAS AS POSSIBLE YES BUT THEY SHOULDN'T INTERFERE WITH THE OLD ONES WHEN THE OLD ONES HAVE BEEN THE RIGHT ONES ISABEL TURNED ABOUT AGAIN IF YOU MEAN THAT I HAD ANY IDEA WITH REGARD TO MISTER GOODWOOD
1069-133699-0034 BUT SHE FALTERED BEFORE HER FRIEND'S IMPLACABLE GLITTER MY DEAR CHILD YOU CERTAINLY ENCOURAGED HIM ISABEL MADE FOR THE MOMENT AS IF TO DENY THIS CHARGE INSTEAD OF WHICH HOWEVER SHE PRESENTLY ANSWERED
1069-133699-0035 IT'S VERY TRUE I DID ENCOURAGE HIM AND THEN SHE ASKED IF HER COMPANION HAD LEARNED FROM MISTER GOODWOOD WHAT HE INTENDED TO DO IT WAS A CONCESSION TO HER CURIOSITY FOR SHE DISLIKED DISCUSSING THE SUBJECT
1069-133699-0036 AND FOUND HENRIETTA WANTING IN DELICACY I ASKED HIM AND HE SAID HE MEANT TO DO NOTHING MISS STACKPOLE ANSWERED BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HE'S NOT A MAN TO DO NOTHING HE IS A MAN OF HIGH BOLD ACTION
1069-133699-0037 AND WHATEVER HE DOES WILL ALWAYS BE RIGHT I QUITE BELIEVE THAT HENRIETTA MIGHT BE WANTING IN DELICACY BUT IT TOUCHED THE GIRL ALL THE SAME TO HEAR THIS DECLARATION AH YOU DO CARE FOR HIM HER VISITOR RANG OUT
1069-133699-0038 WHATEVER HE DOES WILL ALWAYS BE RIGHT ISABEL REPEATED WHEN A MAN'S OF THAT INFALLIBLE MOULD WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO HIM WHAT ONE FEELS IT MAY NOT MATTER TO HIM BUT IT MATTERS TO ONE'S SELF AH
1069-133699-0039 I HOPE HE'LL HATE ME THEN SAID ISABEL I BELIEVE YOU HOPE IT ABOUT AS MUCH AS I BELIEVE HIM CAPABLE OF IT TO THIS OBSERVATION OUR HEROINE MADE NO RETURN
1069-133699-0040 SHE WAS ABSORBED IN THE ALARM GIVEN HER BY HENRIETTA'S INTIMATION THAT CASPAR GOODWOOD WOULD PRESENT HIMSELF AT GARDENCOURT SHE PRETENDED TO HERSELF HOWEVER THAT SHE THOUGHT THE EVENT IMPOSSIBLE AND LATER
1069-133699-0041 SHE COMMUNICATED HER DISBELIEF TO HER FRIEND FOR THE NEXT FORTY EIGHT HOURS NEVERTHELESS SHE STOOD PREPARED TO HEAR THE YOUNG MAN'S NAME ANNOUNCED THE FEELING PRESSED UPON HER IT MADE THE AIR SULTRY
1069-133699-0042 AND AFTER STROLLING ABOUT FOR SOME TIME IN A MANNER AT ONCE LISTLESS AND RESTLESS HAD SEATED HERSELF ON A GARDEN BENCH WITHIN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE BENEATH A SPREADING BEECH WHERE IN A WHITE DRESS ORNAMENTED WITH BLACK RIBBONS
1069-133699-0043 SHE FORMED AMONG THE FLICKERING SHADOWS A GRACEFUL AND HARMONIOUS IMAGE
1069-133699-0044 AS TO WHOM THE PROPOSAL OF AN OWNERSHIP DIVIDED WITH HER COUSIN HAD BEEN APPLIED AS IMPARTIALLY AS POSSIBLE AS IMPARTIALLY AS BUNCHIE'S OWN SOMEWHAT FICKLE AND INCONSTANT SYMPATHIES WOULD ALLOW
1069-133699-0045 BUT SHE WAS NOTIFIED FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THIS OCCASION OF THE FINITE CHARACTER OF BUNCHIE'S INTELLECT HITHERTO SHE HAD BEEN MAINLY STRUCK WITH ITS EXTENT
1069-133699-0046 IT SEEMED TO HER AT LAST THAT SHE WOULD DO WELL TO TAKE A BOOK FORMERLY WHEN HEAVY HEARTED SHE HAD BEEN ABLE WITH THE HELP OF SOME WELL CHOSEN VOLUME TO TRANSFER THE SEAT OF CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE ORGAN OF PURE REASON
1069-133699-0047 OF LATE IT WAS NOT TO BE DENIED LITERATURE HAD SEEMED A FADING LIGHT AND EVEN AFTER SHE HAD REMINDED HERSELF THAT HER UNCLE'S LIBRARY WAS PROVIDED WITH A COMPLETE SET OF THOSE AUTHORS WHICH NO GENTLEMAN'S COLLECTION SHOULD BE WITHOUT
1069-133699-0048 SHE SAT MOTIONLESS AND EMPTY HANDED HER EYES BENT ON THE COOL GREEN TURF OF THE LAWN HER MEDITATIONS WERE PRESENTLY INTERRUPTED BY THE ARRIVAL OF A SERVANT WHO HANDED HER A LETTER THE LETTER BORE THE LONDON POSTMARK
1069-133699-0049 YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT WHEN YOU GAVE ME MY DISMISSAL AT ALBANY THREE MONTHS AGO I DID NOT ACCEPT IT I PROTESTED AGAINST IT YOU IN FACT APPEARED TO ACCEPT MY PROTEST AND TO ADMIT THAT I HAD THE RIGHT ON MY SIDE
1069-133699-0050 I HAD COME TO SEE YOU WITH THE HOPE THAT YOU WOULD LET ME BRING YOU OVER TO MY CONVICTION MY REASONS FOR ENTERTAINING THIS HOPE HAD BEEN OF THE BEST BUT YOU DISAPPOINTED IT I FOUND YOU CHANGED
1069-133699-0051 ARBITRARY OR CAPRICIOUS THEREFORE IT IS THAT I BELIEVE YOU WILL LET ME SEE YOU AGAIN YOU TOLD ME THAT I'M NOT DISAGREEABLE TO YOU AND I BELIEVE IT FOR I DON'T SEE WHY THAT SHOULD BE I SHALL ALWAYS THINK OF YOU
1069-133699-0052 I SHALL NEVER THINK OF ANY ONE ELSE I CAME TO ENGLAND SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE I COULDN'T STAY AT HOME AFTER YOU HAD GONE I HATED THE COUNTRY BECAUSE YOU WERE NOT IN IT IF I LIKE THIS COUNTRY AT PRESENT
1069-133699-0053 IT IS ONLY BECAUSE IT HOLDS YOU I HAVE BEEN TO ENGLAND BEFORE BUT HAVE NEVER ENJOYED IT MUCH MAY I NOT COME AND SEE YOU FOR HALF AN HOUR THIS AT PRESENT IS THE DEAREST WISH OF YOURS FAITHFULLY
1069-133699-0054 CASPAR GOODWOOD ISABEL READ THIS MISSIVE WITH SUCH DEEP ATTENTION THAT SHE HAD NOT PERCEIVED AN APPROACHING TREAD ON THE SOFT GRASS
1069-133709-0000 HAD LAID BEFORE HER A PAIR OF ALTERNATIVES NOW OF COURSE YOU'RE COMPLETELY YOUR OWN MISTRESS AND ARE AS FREE AS THE BIRD ON THE BOUGH I DON'T MEAN YOU WERE NOT SO BEFORE BUT YOU'RE AT PRESENT ON A DIFFERENT FOOTING
1069-133709-0001 PROPERTY ERECTS A KIND OF BARRIER YOU CAN DO A GREAT MANY THINGS IF YOU'RE RICH WHICH WOULD BE SEVERELY CRITICISED IF YOU WERE POOR YOU CAN GO AND COME YOU CAN TRAVEL ALONE YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN ESTABLISHMENT
1069-133709-0002 I MEAN OF COURSE IF YOU'LL TAKE A COMPANION SOME DECAYED GENTLEWOMAN WITH A DARNED CASHMERE AND DYED HAIR WHO PAINTS ON VELVET YOU DON'T THINK YOU'D LIKE THAT OF COURSE YOU CAN DO AS YOU PLEASE
1069-133709-0003 SHE'D KEEP PEOPLE OFF VERY WELL I THINK
1069-133709-0004 THAT IT'S A GREAT DEAL BETTER YOU SHOULD REMAIN WITH ME IN SPITE OF THERE BEING NO OBLIGATION IT'S BETTER FOR SEVERAL REASONS QUITE APART FROM YOUR LIKING IT I SHOULDN'T THINK YOU'D LIKE IT BUT I RECOMMEND YOU TO MAKE THE SACRIFICE
1069-133709-0005 SHE HAD A GREAT REGARD FOR WHAT WAS USUALLY DEEMED DECENT AND A YOUNG GENTLEWOMAN WITHOUT VISIBLE RELATIONS HAD ALWAYS STRUCK HER AS A FLOWER WITHOUT FOLIAGE
1069-133709-0006 WHEN SHE SAT IN HER DAMP WATERPROOF AND SKETCHED THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT EUROPE WOULD OFFER TO A YOUNG PERSON OF TASTE THIS HOWEVER WAS IN A GREAT MEASURE THE GIRL'S OWN FAULT SHE HAD GOT A GLIMPSE OF HER AUNT'S EXPERIENCE
1069-133709-0007 AND HER IMAGINATION CONSTANTLY ANTICIPATED THE JUDGEMENTS AND EMOTIONS OF A WOMAN WHO HAD VERY LITTLE OF THE SAME FACULTY APART FROM THIS MISSUS TOUCHETT HAD A GREAT MERIT SHE WAS AS HONEST AS A PAIR OF COMPASSES
1069-133709-0008 BUT WAS NEVER OVER INQUISITIVE AS REGARDS THE TERRITORY OF HER NEIGHBOUR ISABEL CAME AT LAST TO HAVE A KIND OF UNDEMONSTRABLE PITY FOR HER THERE SEEMED SOMETHING SO DREARY IN THE CONDITION OF A PERSON WHOSE NATURE HAD AS IT WERE
1069-133709-0009 SO LITTLE SURFACE OFFERED SO LIMITED A FACE TO THE ACCRETIONS OF HUMAN CONTACT NOTHING TENDER NOTHING SYMPATHETIC HAD EVER HAD A CHANCE TO FASTEN UPON IT
1069-133709-0010 NO WIND SOWN BLOSSOM NO FAMILIAR SOFTENING MOSS HER OFFERED HER PASSIVE EXTENT IN OTHER WORDS WAS ABOUT THAT OF A KNIFE EDGE ISABEL HAD REASON TO BELIEVE NONE THE LESS
1069-133709-0011 SHE WAS LEARNING TO SACRIFICE CONSISTENCY TO CONSIDERATIONS OF THAT INFERIOR ORDER FOR WHICH THE EXCUSE MUST BE FOUND IN THE PARTICULAR CASE IT WAS NOT TO THE CREDIT OF HER ABSOLUTE RECTITUDE
1069-133709-0012 THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE GONE THE LONGEST WAY ROUND TO FLORENCE IN ORDER TO SPEND A FEW WEEKS WITH HER INVALID SON
1069-133709-0013 THAT WHEN RALPH WISHED TO SEE HER HE WAS AT LIBERTY TO REMEMBER THAT PALAZZO CRESCENTINI CONTAINED A LARGE APARTMENT KNOWN AS THE QUARTER OF THE SIGNORINO I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING
1069-133709-0014 ISABEL SAID TO THIS YOUNG MAN THE DAY AFTER HER ARRIVAL AT SAN REMO SOMETHING I'VE THOUGHT MORE THAN ONCE OF ASKING YOU BY LETTER BUT THAT I'VE HESITATED ON THE WHOLE TO WRITE ABOUT FACE TO FACE NEVERTHELESS
1069-133709-0015 WHAT DOES IT MATTER MY DEAR ISABEL WHETHER I KNEW MY FATHER WAS VERY OBSTINATE SO SAID THE GIRL YOU DID KNOW YES HE TOLD ME WE EVEN TALKED IT OVER A LITTLE
1069-133709-0016 ASKED ISABEL ABRUPTLY WHY AS A KIND OF COMPLIMENT A COMPLIMENT ON WHAT ON YOUR SO BEAUTIFULLY EXISTING HE LIKED ME TOO MUCH SHE PRESENTLY DECLARED THAT'S A WAY WE ALL HAVE
1069-133709-0017 IF I BELIEVED THAT I SHOULD BE VERY UNHAPPY FORTUNATELY I DON'T BELIEVE IT I WANT TO BE TREATED WITH JUSTICE I WANT NOTHING BUT THAT VERY GOOD BUT YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT JUSTICE TO A LOVELY BEING
1069-133709-0018 IS AFTER ALL A FLORID SORT OF SENTIMENT I'M NOT A LOVELY BEING HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN I'M ASKING SUCH ODIOUS QUESTIONS I MUST SEEM TO YOU DELICATE
1069-133709-0019 YOU SEEM TO ME TROUBLED SAID RALPH I AM TROUBLED ABOUT WHAT FOR A MOMENT SHE ANSWERED NOTHING THEN SHE BROKE OUT DO YOU THINK IT GOOD FOR ME SUDDENLY TO BE MADE SO RICH
1069-133709-0020 HENRIETTA DOESN'T OH HANG HENRIETTA SAID RALPH COARSELY IF YOU ASK ME I'M DELIGHTED AT IT IS THAT WHY YOUR FATHER DID IT FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT I DIFFER WITH MISS STACKPOLE
1069-133709-0021 RALPH WENT ON MORE GRAVELY I THINK IT VERY GOOD FOR YOU TO HAVE MEANS ISABEL LOOKED AT HIM WITH SERIOUS EYES I WONDER WHETHER YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR ME OR WHETHER YOU CARE IF I KNOW DEPEND UPON IT I CARE
1069-133709-0022 DON'T QUESTION YOUR CONSCIENCE SO MUCH IT WILL GET OUT OF TUNE LIKE A STRUMMED PIANO KEEP IT FOR GREAT OCCASIONS DON'T TRY SO MUCH TO FORM YOUR CHARACTER IT'S LIKE TRYING TO PULL OPEN A TIGHT TENDER YOUNG ROSE
1069-133709-0023 LIVE AS YOU LIKE BEST AND YOUR CHARACTER WILL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF MOST THINGS ARE GOOD FOR YOU THE EXCEPTIONS ARE VERY RARE AND A COMFORTABLE INCOME'S NOT ONE OF THEM RALPH PAUSED SMILING
1069-133709-0024 ISABEL HAD LISTENED QUICKLY YOU'VE TOO MUCH POWER OF THOUGHT ABOVE ALL TOO MUCH CONSCIENCE RALPH ADDED IT'S OUT OF ALL REASON THE NUMBER OF THINGS YOU THINK WRONG PUT BACK YOUR WATCH DIET YOUR FEVER
1069-133709-0025 IT'S NEVER WRONG TO DO THAT SHE HAD LISTENED EAGERLY AS I SAY AND IT WAS HER NATURE TO UNDERSTAND QUICKLY I WONDER IF YOU APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAY IF YOU DO YOU TAKE A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY YOU FRIGHTEN ME A LITTLE
1069-133709-0026 BUT I THINK I'M RIGHT SAID RALPH PERSISTING IN CHEER ALL THE SAME WHAT YOU SAY IS VERY TRUE ISABEL PURSUED YOU COULD SAY NOTHING MORE TRUE I'M ABSORBED IN MYSELF I LOOK AT LIFE TOO MUCH AS A DOCTOR'S PRESCRIPTION
1069-133709-0027 WHY INDEED SHOULD WE PERPETUALLY BE THINKING WHETHER THINGS ARE GOOD FOR US AS IF WE WERE PATIENTS LYING IN A HOSPITAL WHY SHOULD I BE SO AFRAID OF NOT DOING RIGHT AS IF IT MATTERED TO THE WORLD WHETHER I DO RIGHT OR WRONG
1069-133709-0028 YOU'RE A CAPITAL PERSON TO ADVISE SAID RALPH YOU TAKE THE WIND OUT OF MY SAILS SHE LOOKED AT HIM AS IF SHE HAD NOT HEARD HIM THOUGH SHE WAS FOLLOWING OUT THE TRAIN OF REFLEXION WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD KINDLED
1069-133709-0029 A LARGE FORTUNE MEANS FREEDOM AND I'M AFRAID OF THAT IT'S SUCH A FINE THING AND ONE SHOULD MAKE SUCH A GOOD USE OF IT IF ONE SHOULDN'T ONE WOULD BE ASHAMED AND ONE MUST KEEP THINKING IT'S A CONSTANT EFFORT
1069-133709-0030 I'M NOT SURE IT'S NOT A GREATER HAPPINESS TO BE POWERLESS FOR WEAK PEOPLE I'VE NO DOUBT IT'S A GREATER HAPPINESS FOR WEAK PEOPLE THE EFFORT NOT TO BE CONTEMPTIBLE MUST BE GREAT AND HOW DO YOU KNOW I'M NOT WEAK ISABEL ASKED
1069-133709-0031 THE GATE OF ADMIRATIONS ITALY AS YET IMPERFECTLY SEEN AND FELT STRETCHED BEFORE HER AS A LAND OF PROMISE A LAND IN WHICH A LOVE OF THE BEAUTIFUL MIGHT BE COMFORTED BY ENDLESS KNOWLEDGE
1069-133709-0032 WHENEVER SHE STROLLED UPON THE SHORE WITH HER COUSIN AND SHE WAS THE COMPANION OF HIS DAILY WALK SHE LOOKED ACROSS THE SEA WITH LONGING EYES TO WHERE SHE KNEW THAT GENOA LAY
1069-133709-0033 SHE WAS GLAD TO PAUSE HOWEVER ON THE EDGE OF THIS LARGER ADVENTURE THERE WAS SUCH A THRILL EVEN IN THE PRELIMINARY HOVERING IT AFFECTED HER MOREOVER AS A PEACEFUL INTERLUDE AS A HUSH OF THE DRUM AND FIFE IN A CAREER WHICH SHE HAD LITTLE WARRANT
1069-133709-0034 AS YET FOR REGARDING AS AGITATED BUT WHICH NEVERTHELESS SHE WAS CONSTANTLY PICTURING TO HERSELF BY THE LIGHT OF HER HOPES HER FEARS HER FANCIES HER AMBITIONS HER PREDILECTIONS
1069-133709-0035 MADAME MERLE HAD PREDICTED TO MISSUS TOUCHETT THAT AFTER THEIR YOUNG FRIEND HAD PUT HER HAND INTO HER POCKET HALF A DOZEN TIMES SHE WOULD BE RECONCILED TO THE IDEA THAT IT HAD BEEN FILLED BY A MUNIFICENT UNCLE
1069-133709-0036 GROWN USED TO FEELING RICH THE CONSCIOUSNESS IN QUESTION FOUND A PROPER PLACE IN RATHER A DENSE LITTLE GROUP OF IDEAS THAT SHE HAD ABOUT HERSELF AND OFTEN IT WAS BY NO MEANS THE LEAST AGREEABLE
1069-133709-0037 IT TOOK PERPETUALLY FOR GRANTED A THOUSAND GOOD INTENTIONS SHE LOST HERSELF IN A MAZE OF VISIONS THE FINE THINGS TO BE DONE BY A RICH INDEPENDENT GENEROUS GIRL WHO TOOK A LARGE HUMAN VIEW OF OCCASIONS AND OBLIGATIONS
1069-133709-0038 WERE SUBLIME IN THE MASS HER FORTUNE THEREFORE BECAME TO HER MIND A PART OF HER BETTER SELF IT GAVE HER IMPORTANCE GAVE HER EVEN TO HER OWN IMAGINATION A CERTAIN IDEAL BEAUTY
1069-133709-0039 WHICH IN SPITE OF INCREASING DISTANCE WERE STILL SUFFICIENTLY SALIENT THEY WERE RECOGNISABLE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
1069-133709-0040 SHE COULD SUMMON BACK HER FAITH IN CASE OF NEED WITH AN EFFORT BUT THE EFFORT WAS OFTEN PAINFUL EVEN WHEN THE REALITY HAD BEEN PLEASANT THE PAST WAS APT TO LOOK DEAD AND ITS REVIVAL RATHER TO SHOW THE
1069-133709-0041 LIVID LIGHT OF A JUDGEMENT DAY THE GIRL MOREOVER WAS NOT PRONE TO TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT SHE HERSELF LIVED IN THE MIND OF OTHERS
1069-133709-0042 SHE WAS CAPABLE OF BEING WOUNDED BY THE DISCOVERY THAT SHE HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN BUT OF ALL LIBERTIES THE ONE SHE HERSELF FOUND SWEETEST WAS THE LIBERTY TO FORGET SHE HAD NOT GIVEN HER LAST SHILLING SENTIMENTALLY SPEAKING
1069-133709-0043 EITHER TO CASPAR GOODWOOD OR TO LORD WARBURTON AND YET COULDN'T BUT FEEL THEM APPRECIABLY IN DEBT TO HER SHE HAD OF COURSE REMINDED HERSELF THAT SHE WAS TO HEAR FROM MISTER GOODWOOD AGAIN BUT THIS WAS NOT TO BE FOR ANOTHER YEAR AND A HALF
1069-133709-0044 AND IN THAT TIME A GREAT MANY THINGS MIGHT HAPPEN SHE HAD INDEED FAILED TO SAY TO HERSELF THAT HER AMERICAN SUITOR MIGHT FIND SOME OTHER GIRL MORE COMFORTABLE TO WOO BECAUSE THOUGH IT WAS CERTAIN MANY OTHER GIRLS WOULD PROVE SO
1069-133709-0045 SHE HAD NOT THE SMALLEST BELIEF THAT THIS MERIT WOULD ATTRACT HIM BUT SHE REFLECTED THAT SHE HERSELF MIGHT KNOW THE HUMILIATION OF CHANGE MIGHT REALLY FOR THAT MATTER COME TO THE END OF THE THINGS THAT WERE NOT CASPAR
1069-133709-0046 A CLEAR AND QUIET HARBOUR ENCLOSED BY A BRAVE GRANITE BREAKWATER BUT THAT DAY COULD ONLY COME IN ITS ORDER AND SHE COULDN'T WAIT FOR IT WITH FOLDED HANDS THAT LORD WARBURTON SHOULD CONTINUE TO CHERISH HER IMAGE
1069-133709-0047 SEEMED TO HER MORE THAN A NOBLE HUMILITY OR AN ENLIGHTENED PRIDE OUGHT TO WISH TO RECKON WITH SHE HAD SO DEFINITELY UNDERTAKEN TO PRESERVE NO RECORD OF WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM THAT A CORRESPONDING EFFORT ON HIS OWN PART
1069-133709-0048 WOULD BE EMINENTLY JUST THIS WAS NOT AS IT MAY SEEM MERELY A THEORY TINGED WITH SARCASM ISABEL CANDIDLY BELIEVED THAT HIS LORDSHIP WOULD IN THE USUAL PHRASE GET OVER HIS DISAPPOINTMENT
1069-133709-0049 HE HAD BEEN DEEPLY AFFECTED THIS SHE BELIEVED AND SHE WAS STILL CAPABLE OF DERIVING PLEASURE FROM THE BELIEF BUT IT WAS ABSURD THAT A MAN BOTH SO INTELLIGENT AND SO HONOURABLY DEALT WITH
1069-133709-0050 SHOULD CULTIVATE A SCAR OUT OF PROPORTION TO ANY WOUND ENGLISHMEN LIKED MOREOVER TO BE COMFORTABLE SAID ISABEL AND THERE COULD BE LITTLE COMFORT FOR LORD WARBURTON IN THE LONG RUN IN BROODING OVER A SELF SUFFICIENT AMERICAN GIRL
1069-133709-0051 WHO HAD BEEN BUT A CASUAL ACQUAINTANCE SHE FLATTERED HERSELF THAT SHOULD SHE HEAR FROM ONE DAY TO ANOTHER THAT HE HAD MARRIED SOME YOUNG WOMAN OF HIS OWN COUNTRY WHO HAD DONE MORE TO DESERVE HIM
1069-133709-0052 SHE SHOULD RECEIVE THE NEWS WITHOUT A PANG EVEN OF SURPRISE IT WOULD HAVE PROVED THAT HE BELIEVED SHE WAS FIRM WHICH WAS WHAT SHE WISHED TO SEEM TO HIM
1081-125237-0000 BEFORE THE SITTINGS OF THE GREAT ASSEMBLY HAD COME TO AN END A YOUNG STATESMAN DESTINED TO PLAY THE LEADING PART IN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DUTCH REPUBLIC DURING TWO DECADES HAD ALREADY MADE HIS MARK
1081-125237-0001 HIS READINESS AND PERSUASIVENESS OF SPEECH HIS INDUSTRY AND HIS GIFTS AT ONCE OF SWIFT INSIGHT AND ORDERLY THOROUGHNESS
1081-125237-0002 BUT THE OLD SORES REMAINED OPEN MOREOVER THE REFUSAL OF THE STATES GENERAL TO RECEIVE THE PARLIAMENTARY ENVOYS THE MURDER OF DORESLAER AND THE PROTECTION AFFORDED TO ROYALIST REFUGEES HAD BEEN ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RESENTMENT
1081-125237-0003 BUT THE ENGLISH COUNCIL HAD NOT FELT STRONG ENOUGH TO TAKE ACTION THE DEATH OF THE PRINCE OF ORANGE
1081-125237-0004 APPEARED AT FIRST TO OPEN OUT A PROSPECT OF FRIENDLIER RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO NEIGHBOURING REPUBLICS IN JANUARY SIXTEEN FIFTY ONE THE GREAT ASSEMBLY FORMALLY RECOGNISED THE COMMONWEALTH
1081-125237-0005 AND DETERMINED TO SEND BACK TO HIS OLD POST IN LONDON THE VETERAN AMBASSADOR JOACHIMI WHO HAD BEEN RECALLED THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT ON THEIR PART ANTICIPATED HIS RETURN BY DESPATCHING IN MARCH OLIVER SAINT JOHN AND WALTER STRICKLAND
1081-125237-0006 AND SAINT JOHN AND STRICKLAND GREETED WITH LOUD CRIES OF REGICIDES AND MANY ABUSIVE EPITHETS REMEMBERING THE FATE OF DORESLAER WERE IN FEAR OF THEIR LIVES
1081-125237-0007 ON APRIL FOURTH A CONFERENCE WAS OPENED BETWEEN THE ENVOYS AND SIX COMMISSIONERS APPOINTED BY THE STATES TO CONSIDER THE PROPOSALS OF THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT FOR A MORE STRICT AND INTIMATE ALLIANCE AND UNION BETWEEN THE TWO STATES THE DUTCH QUICKLY PERCEIVED
1081-125237-0008 THAT WHAT THE ENGLISH REALLY WANTED WAS NOTHING LESS THAN SUCH A BINDING ALLIANCE OR RATHER COALITION AS WOULD PRACTICALLY MERGE THE LESSER STATE IN THE GREATER BUT THE VERY IDEA OF SUCH A LOSS OF THE INDEPENDENCE THAT THEY HAD ONLY JUST WON WAS TO THE NETHERLANDERS UNTHINKABLE
1081-125237-0009 THE NEGOTIATIONS CAME TO A DEADLOCK
1081-125237-0010 FOREMOST AMONGST THEM PRINCE EDWARD SON OF THE QUEEN OF BOHEMIA THE PARLIAMENT THREATENED TO RECALL THE ENVOYS BUT CONSENTED THAT THEY SHOULD REMAIN ON THE UNDERTAKING OF THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND TO PROTECT THEM FROM FURTHER ATTACKS AND TO PUNISH THE OFFENDERS
1081-125237-0011 NEW PROPOSALS WERE ACCORDINGLY MADE FOR AN OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE ALLIANCE WITHOUT ANY SUGGESTION OF A UNION COUPLED WITH THE CONDITION THAT BOTH STATES SHOULD BIND THEMSELVES NOT TO ALLOW THE PRESENCE WITHIN THEIR BOUNDARIES OF AVOWED ENEMIES OF THE OTHER IN OTHER WORDS
1081-125237-0012 THE EXPULSION OF THE MEMBERS AND ADHERENTS OF THE HOUSE OF STEWART INCLUDING THE PRINCESS ROYAL AND THE QUEEN OF BOHEMIA WITH THEIR CHILDREN
1081-125237-0013 EVEN THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND DARED NOT CONSIDER SUCH TERMS AND THE STATES GENERAL WOULD HAVE ANGRILY REJECTED THEM AFTER SOME FURTHER PARLEYING THEREFORE ABOUT FISHERIES AND TRADE RESTRICTIONS IT WAS FELT THAT NO AGREEMENT COULD BE REACHED
1081-125237-0014 AND SAINT JOHN AND STRICKLAND RETURNED TO ENGLAND ON JULY THIRTY FIRST SIXTEEN FIFTY ONE THEIR FAILURE CREATED A VERY BAD IMPRESSION UPON THE PARLIAMENT ALL THE OLD COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE DUTCH WERE REVIVED AND
1081-125237-0015 AS THEY HAD REFUSED THE OFFER OF FRIENDSHIP THAT HAD BEEN MADE TO THEM IT WAS RESOLVED THAT STRONG MEASURES SHOULD BE TAKEN TO OBTAIN REDRESS FOR PAST GRIEVANCES AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF ENGLISH TRADE INTERESTS AT THE INSTANCE OF SAINT JOHN
1081-125237-0016 THE FAMOUS NAVIGATION ACT WAS PASSED BY THE PARLIAMENT OCTOBER NINTH SIXTEEN FIFTY ONE THIS ACT STRUCK A MORTAL BLOW AT THE DUTCH CARRYING TRADE BY FORBIDDING THE IMPORTATION OF FOREIGN GOODS INTO ENGLISH PORTS EXCEPT IN ENGLISH BOTTOMS OR IN THOSE OF THE COUNTRIES WHICH HAD PRODUCED THE GOODS
1081-125237-0017 SCARCELY LESS INJURIOUS WAS THE PROHIBITION TO ALIENS TO FISH IN BRITISH WATERS AND THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE RIGHTS BASED ON THE MAGNUS INTERCURSUS FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF WHICH DUTCH STATESMEN HAD SO LONG AND STRENUOUSLY FOUGHT
1081-125237-0018 THERE WAS CONSTERNATION IN HOLLAND AND THE STATES GENERAL DETERMINED TO SEND A SPECIAL EMBASSY TO LONDON
1081-125237-0019 A MAN IN WHOSE RIPE JUDGMENT THEY HAD CONFIDENCE TO THE OFFICE OF COUNCIL PENSIONARY
1081-125237-0020 WHO HAVING BEEN GIVEN LETTERS OF MARQUE TO PREY UPON FRENCH COMMERCE
1081-125237-0021 THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT HOWEVER MET THE DUTCH COMPLAINTS BY RAKING UP THE LONG LIST OF GRIEVANCES THAT HAD STIRRED UP A BITTER FEELING OF POPULAR HATRED AGAINST THE UNITED PROVINCES IN ENGLAND AND BY DEMANDING REPARATION
1081-125237-0022 THEY FURTHER DEMANDED THAT DUTCH COMMANDERS SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE ENGLAND'S SOVEREIGNTY BY STRIKING FLAG AND SAIL AND BY FIRING A SALUTE WHENEVER ANY OF THEIR SQUADRONS MET ENGLISH SHIPS IN THE NARROW SEAS IT WAS THESE LAST TWO QUESTIONS
1081-125237-0023 THE RIGHT OF SEARCH AND THE STRIKING OF THE FLAG THAT WERE TO BE THE REAL CAUSES OF THE OUTBREAK OF A WAR THAT WAS DESIRED BY NEITHER OF THE TWO GOVERNMENTS BUT POPULAR FEELING AND THE COURSE OF EVENTS WAS TOO STRONG FOR THEM THE NEWS OF THE SEIZURE OF THEIR VESSELS
1081-125237-0024 NOT MERELY BY PRIVATEERS BUT BY AN ENGLISH SQUADRON UNDER AYSCUE IN THE WEST INDIES HAD CAUSED INTENSE INDIGNATION AND ALARM IN HOLLAND AND ESPECIALLY IN AMSTERDAM PRESSURE WAS BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THE STATES GENERAL AND THE ADMIRALTIES
1081-125237-0025 WHO IN PURSUANCE OF ECONOMY HAD REDUCED THE FLEET TO SEVENTY FIVE SHIPS IT WAS RESOLVED THEREFORE ON FEBRUARY TWENTY SECOND
1081-125237-0026 THE COUNCIL OF STATE ON HEARING OF THIS BEGAN ALSO TO MAKE READY FOR EVENTUALITIES NEGOTIATIONS WERE STILL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES WHEN MARTIN TROMP THE VICTOR OF THE BATTLE OF THE DOWNS
1081-125237-0027 NOW LIEUTENANT ADMIRAL OF HOLLAND WAS SENT TO SEA WITH FIFTY SHIPS AND INSTRUCTIONS TO PROTECT DUTCH MERCHANTMEN FROM INTERFERENCE AND TO SEE THAT THE STATES SUFFERED NO AFFRONT NOTHING WAS ACTUALLY SAID ABOUT THE STRIKING OF THE FLAG
1081-125237-0028 IT CAME SUDDENLY THROUGH A MISUNDERSTANDING THE DUTCH ADMIRAL WHILE CRUISING PAST DOVER MET ON MAY TWENTY NINTH FIFTEEN ENGLISH SHIPS UNDER BLAKE
1081-125237-0029 TROMP DECLARED THAT HE HAD GIVEN ORDERS TO STRIKE THE FLAG BUT THAT BLAKE AGAIN FIRED BEFORE THERE WAS TIME TO CARRY THEM OUT BE THIS AS IT MAY THE TWO FLEETS WERE SOON ENGAGED IN A REGULAR FIGHT AND THE ENGLISH BEING REINFORCED TROMP WITHDREW AT NIGHTFALL
1081-125237-0030 TO THE FRENCH COAST HAVING LOST TWO SHIPS GREAT WAS THE ANGER AROUSED IN ENGLAND WHERE THE DUTCH WERE UNIVERSALLY REGARDED AS THE AGGRESSORS IN THE NETHERLANDS WHERE THE PEACE PARTY WAS STRONG MANY WERE DISPOSED TO BLAME TROMP DESPITE HIS PROTESTS
1081-125237-0031 ADRIAN PAUW HIMSELF LEFT HASTILY FOR LONDON JOHN DE WITT BEING APPOINTED TO ACT AS HIS DEPUTY DURING HIS ABSENCE PAUW'S STRENUOUS EFFORTS HOWEVER TO MAINTAIN PEACE WERE ALL IN VAIN DESPITE THE STRONG LEANINGS OF CROMWELL TOWARDS A PEACEFUL SOLUTION
1081-125237-0032 BUT POPULAR FEELING ON BOTH SIDES WAS NOW AROUSED
1081-125237-0033 IF HUMILIATING TERMS WERE SUBMITTED TO STIFFENED THEIR ATTITUDE THE RESULT WAS THAT THE ENVOYS LEFT LONDON ON JUNE THIRTIETH SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO AND WAR WAS DECLARED THE DUTCH STATESMEN WHO SOUGHT TO AVOID HOSTILITIES WERE RIGHT
1081-125237-0034 ALL THE ADVANTAGES WERE ON THE SIDE OF THEIR ENEMIES THE DUTCH MERCHANT FLEETS COVERED THE SEAS AND THE WELFARE OF THE LAND DEPENDED ON COMMERCE THE ENGLISH HAD LITTLE TO LOSE COMMERCIALLY
1081-125237-0035 WAS SUPERIOR IN ALMOST ALL OTHER RESPECTS THE STUARTS HAD DEVOTED GREAT ATTENTION TO THE FLEET AND WOULD HAVE DONE MORE BUT FOR LACK OF MEANS CHARLES MUCH ABUSED SHIP MONEY WAS EMPLOYED BY HIM FOR THE CREATION OF THE FIRST ENGLISH PROFESSIONAL NAVY
1081-125237-0036 IT HAD BEEN LARGELY INCREASED BY THE PARLIAMENT AFTER SIXTEEN FORTY EIGHT AND ITS GENERALS BLAKE PENN AND AYSCUE HAD ALREADY ACQUIRED MUCH VALUABLE EXPERIENCE IN THEIR ENCOUNTERS WITH THE ROYALIST SQUADRON UNDER PRINCE RUPERT
1081-125237-0037 AND IN LONG CRUISES TO THE WEST INDIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF FORCING THE ENGLISH COLONIES TO ACKNOWLEDGE PARLIAMENTARY RULE THE CREWS THEREFORE WERE WELL TRAINED AND THE SHIPS WERE LARGER STRONGER AND BETTER ARMED THAN THOSE OF THE DUTCH
1081-125237-0038 THE POSITION OF ENGLAND LYING AS IT DID ATHWART THE ROUTES BY WHICH THE DUTCH MERCHANT FLEETS MUST SAIL WAS A GREAT ADVANTAGE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT WAS THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING A CENTRAL CONTROL
1081-125237-0039 WHEREAS IN THE NETHERLANDS THERE WERE FIVE DISTINCT BOARDS OF ADMIRALTY TO SOME EXTENT JEALOUS OF EACH OTHER AND NOW LACKING THE SUPREME DIRECTION OF AN ADMIRAL GENERAL THE WAR BEGAN BY A SERIES OF ENGLISH SUCCESSES AND OF DUTCH MISFORTUNES
1081-125237-0040 EARLY IN JULY SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO BLAKE AT THE HEAD OF SIXTY SHIPS SET SAIL FOR THE NORTH TO INTERCEPT THE DUTCH BALTIC COMMERCE AND TO DESTROY THEIR FISHING FLEET OFF THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND
1081-125237-0041 HE LEFT AYSCUE WITH A SMALL SQUADRON TO GUARD THE MOUTH OF THE THAMES TROMP MEANWHILE HAD PUT TO SEA AT THE HEAD OF NEARLY A HUNDRED SHIPS AYSCUE SUCCEEDED IN INTERCEPTING A FLEET OF DUTCH MERCHANTMEN NEAR CALAIS
1081-125237-0042 ALL OF THEM BEING CAPTURED OR BURNT WHILE BLAKE WITH THE MAIN FORCE OFF THE NORTH COAST OF SCOTLAND DESTROYED THE DUTCH FISHING FLEET AND THEIR CONVOY AFTER THESE FIRST BLOWS AGAINST THE ENEMY'S COMMERCE GOOD FORTUNE CONTINUED TO ATTEND THE ENGLISH
1081-125237-0043 TROMP WAS PREVENTED FROM FOLLOWING BLAKE BY STRONG NORTHERLY WINDS HE THEN TURNED UPON AYSCUE WHOSE SMALL FORCE HE MUST HAVE OVERWHELMED BUT FOR A SUDDEN CHANGE TO A SOUTHERLY GALE THE DUTCH ADMIRAL NOW SAILED NORTHWARDS AND JULY TWENTY FIFTH
1081-125237-0044 FOUND THE ENGLISH FLEET OFF THE SHETLANDS A VIOLENT STORM AROSE FROM THE FORCE OF WHICH BLAKE WAS PROTECTED WHILE THE DUTCH VESSELS WERE SCATTERED FAR AND WIDE ON THE FOLLOWING DAY OUT OF NINETY NINE SHIPS TROMP COULD ONLY COLLECT THIRTY FIVE
1081-125237-0045 AND TO MEET AND CONVOY BACK THE HOME COMING SHIPS
1081-125237-0046 AYSCUE HAD PREVIOUSLY SAILED UP CHANNEL WITH FORTY MEN OF WAR AND FIVE FIRESHIPS FOR A SIMILAR PURPOSE THE TWO FLEETS MET ON AUGUST SIXTEENTH AND DESPITE HIS INFERIORITY OF FORCE DE RUYTER FORCED AYSCUE TO WITHDRAW INTO PLYMOUTH AND WAS ABLE TO BRING HIS CONVOY HOME TO SAFETY
1081-125237-0047 THE ILL SUCCESS OF TROMP THOUGH HE WAS IN NO WAY TO BLAME FOR IT CAUSED CONSIDERABLE ALARM AND DISCONTENT IN HOLLAND HIS ENEMIES OF THE STATES PARTY IN THAT PROVINCE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT TO SUSPEND THE GALLANT OLD SEAMAN FROM HIS COMMAND HE WAS AN ORANGIST
1081-125237-0048 AND AS THE ORANGE PARTISANS WERE EVERYWHERE CLAMOROUSLY ACTIVE THE ADMIRAL WAS SUSPECT IN HIS PLACE CORNELISZ WITTE DE WITH WAS APPOINTED A CAPABLE SAILOR BUT DISLIKED IN THE FLEET AS MUCH AS TROMP WAS BELOVED DE WITH EFFECTED A JUNCTION WITH DE RUYTER
1081-125237-0049 AND WITH JOINT FORCES THEY ATTACKED BLAKE ON OCTOBER EIGHTH NEAR THE SHOAL KNOWN AS THE KENTISH KNOCK THE ENGLISH FLEET WAS CONSIDERABLY MORE POWERFUL THAN THE DUTCH AND THE DESERTION OF DE WITH BY SOME TWENTY SHIPS DECIDED THE ISSUE THE DUTCH HAD TO RETURN HOME WITH SOME LOSS
1081-125237-0050 BUT THEY WERE DECEIVED IN THINKING THAT THE STRUGGLE IN THE CHANNEL WAS OVER FOR THE WINTER THE DESERTERS AT THE KENTISH KNOCK WERE PUNISHED
1081-125237-0051 FULL OF RESENTMENT THOUGH HE WAS AT THE BAD TREATMENT HE HAD RECEIVED TROMP WAS TOO GOOD A PATRIOT TO REFUSE AT THE END OF NOVEMBER THE OLD ADMIRAL AT THE HEAD OF ONE HUNDRED WARSHIPS PUT TO SEA FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONVOYING SOME FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MERCHANTMEN THROUGH THE STRAITS
1081-125237-0052 STORMY WEATHER COMPELLED HIM TO SEND THE CONVOY WITH AN ESCORT INTO SHELTER BUT HE HIMSELF WITH SIXTY SHIPS SET OUT TO SEEK THE ENGLISH FLEET WHICH LAY IN THE DOWNS AFTER SOME MANOEUVRING THE TWO FLEETS MET ON DECEMBER TENTH OFF DUNGENESS
1081-125237-0053 WHILE MANY ENGLISH PRIZES WERE CAPTURED THIS STATE OF THINGS WAS HOWEVER NOT TO LAST LONG TOWARDS THE END OF FEBRUARY SIXTEEN FIFTY THREE BLAKE PUT TO SEA WITH NEARLY EIGHTY SHIPS AND ON THE TWENTY FIFTH OFF PORTLAND MET TROMP AT THE HEAD OF A FORCE NEARLY EQUAL TO HIS OWN IN NUMBER
1081-125237-0054 AND HE HAD MOREOVER BEEN AT SEA WITHOUT REPLENISHMENT OF STORES EVER SINCE THE FIGHT AT DUNGENESS WHILE THE ENGLISH HAD COME STRAIGHT FROM PORT THE FIGHT
1081-125237-0055 HAD LASTED FOR TWO WHOLE DAYS WHEN TROMP FOUND THAT HIS POWDER HAD RUN OUT AND THAT ON THE THIRD DAY MORE THAN HALF HIS FLEET WERE UNABLE TO CONTINUE THE STRUGGLE BUT INSPIRING HIS SUBORDINATES DE RUYTER EVERTSEN AND FLORISZOON WITH HIS OWN INDOMITABLE COURAGE
1081-125237-0056 TROMP SUCCEEDED BY EXPERT SEAMANSHIP IN HOLDING OFF THE ENEMY AND CONDUCTING HIS CONVOY WITH SMALL LOSS INTO SAFETY
1081-125237-0057 MEANWHILE BOTH NATIONS HAD BEEN GETTING SICK OF THE WAR THE DUTCH WERE SUFFERING TERRIBLY FROM THE SERIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH THEIR COMMERCE AND CARRYING TRADE AND FROM THE DESTRUCTION OF THE IMPORTANT FISHERIES INDUSTRY
1081-125237-0058 WHILE THE ENGLISH ON THEIR SIDE WERE SHUT OUT FROM THE BALTIC WHERE THE KING OF DENMARK AS THE ALLY OF THE UNITED PROVINCES HAD CLOSED THE SOUND AND FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN WHERE ADMIRAL VAN GALEN
1081-125237-0059 DESTROYED A BRITISH SQUADRON OFF LEGHORN MARCH TWENTY THIRD IN BOTH COUNTRIES THERE WAS A PEACE PARTY
1081-125237-0060 AND WAS AVERSE TO WAR IN THE DUTCH REPUBLIC THE STATES PARTY ESPECIALLY IN HOLLAND THE CHIEF SUFFERER BY THE WAR WAS ANXIOUS FOR A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AND IT FOUND ITS LEADER IN THE YOUTHFUL JOHN DE WITT
1081-125237-0061 HAD BEEN APPOINTED COUNCIL PENSIONARY CROMWELL TOOK PAINS TO LET THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND KNOW HIS FAVOURABLE FEELINGS TOWARDS THEM BY SENDING OVER IN FEBRUARY A PRIVATE EMISSARY
1081-125237-0062 THUS EARLY DID THE NEW COUNCIL PENSIONARY INITIATE A FORM OF DIPLOMACY IN WHICH HE WAS TO PROVE HIMSELF AN ADEPT THIS FIRST EFFORT WAS NOT A SUCCESS THE PARLIAMENT PUBLISHED THE LETTER WITH THE TITLE HUMBLE SUPPLICATION OF THE STATES OF HOLLAND
1081-125237-0063 HE INDUCED THE STATES GENERAL BY A BARE MAJORITY FOUR PROVINCES TO THREE TO SEND A CONCILIATORY LETTER THE DATE OF WHICH APRIL THIRTIETH SIXTEEN FIFTY THREE COINCIDED WITH CROMWELL'S FORCIBLE DISSOLUTION OF THE RUMP PARLIAMENT AND THE ASSUMPTION BY HIM
1081-125237-0064 WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE ARMY OF DICTATORIAL POWERS
1081-125237-0065 AND THEIR INSISTENCE NOW ON THE FULL SATISFACTION OF ALL THE ENGLISH DEMANDS MADE A CONTINUATION OF HOSTILITIES INEVITABLE TROMP AFTER SUCCESSFULLY BRINGING IN TWO LARGE CONVOYS OF MERCHANTMEN ENCOUNTERED JUNE TWELFTH
1081-125237-0066 NEAR THE GABBARD THE ENGLISH FLEET UNDER MONK AND DEANE EACH FLEET NUMBERED ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SAIL BUT THE DUTCH SHIPS WERE INFERIOR IN SIZE SOLIDITY AND WEIGHT OF METAL FOR TWO DAYS THE FIGHT WAS OBSTINATELY AND FIERCELY CONTESTED
1081-125237-0067 TROMP WAS OBLIGED TO RETREAT HAVING LOST TWENTY SHIPS HE COMPLAINED BITTERLY AS DID HIS VICE ADMIRALS DE RUYTER AND DE WITH TO THE BOARD OF ADMIRALTY OF THE INFERIORITY OF THE VESSELS OF HIS FLEET AS COMPARED WITH THOSE OF THE ADVERSARY
1081-125237-0068 THE ENGLISH NOW INSTITUTED A BLOCKADE OF THE DUTCH COAST WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF REDUCING TO DESPERATE STRAITS A LAND WHOSE WELFARE AND PROSPERITY DEPENDED WHOLLY ON COMMERCE AMSTERDAM WAS RUINED IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES DIRECT NEGOTIATION WAS PERFORCE ATTEMPTED
1081-125237-0069 FOUR ENVOYS WERE SENT REPRESENTING THE THREE MARITIME PROVINCES AT FIRST IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE THAT ANY COMMON GROUND OF AGREEMENT COULD BE FOUND CROMWELL WAS OBSESSED WITH THE IDEA OF A POLITICO RELIGIOUS UNION BETWEEN THE TWO REPUBLICS WHICH WOULD HAVE MEANT THE EXTINCTION OF DUTCH INDEPENDENCE
1081-125237-0070 UNA RESPUBLICA WHICH NOTHING BUT SHEER CONQUEST AND DIRE NECESSITY WOULD EVER INDUCE THE DUTCH PEOPLE TO ACCEPT ACCORDINGLY THE WAR WENT ON THOUGH THE ENVOYS DID NOT LEAVE LONDON HOPING STILL THAT SOME BETTER TERMS MIGHT BE OFFERED
1081-125237-0071 BUT IN ORDER TO GAIN BREATHING SPACE FOR THE EFFORTS OF THE NEGOTIATORS ONE THING WAS ESSENTIAL THE BREAKING OF THE BLOCKADE THE ADMIRALTIES MADE A SUPREME EFFORT TO REFIT AND REINFORCE THEIR FLEET BUT IT LAY IN TWO PORTIONS EIGHTY FIVE SAIL UNDER TROMP IN THE MAAS
1081-125237-0072 MONK WITH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SHIPS LAY BETWEEN THEM TO PREVENT THEIR JUNCTION ON AUGUST FOURTH TROMP SAILED OUT AND AFTER A REARGUARD ACTION OFF KATWIJK OUT MANOEUVRED THE ENGLISH COMMANDER AND JOINED DE WITH HE NOW TURNED AND WITH SUPERIOR NUMBERS ATTACKED MONK OFF SCHEVENINGEN
1081-125237-0073 THE OLD HERO FELL MORTALLY WOUNDED AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF WHAT PROVED TO BE AN UNEQUAL FIGHT
1081-125237-0074 THE STATES THOUGH MUCH PERPLEXED TO FIND A SUCCESSOR TO MARTIN TROMP WERE SO FAR FROM BEING DISCOURAGED THAT GREAT ENERGY WAS SHOWN IN REORGANISING THE FLEET
1081-125237-0075 MEANWHILE NEGOTIATIONS HAD BEEN SLOWLY DRAGGING ON THE ACCESSION OF CROMWELL TO SUPREME POWER IN DECEMBER SIXTEEN FIFTY THREE WITH THE TITLE OF LORD PROTECTOR
1081-125237-0076 FOR THE NEW RULER OF ENGLAND HAD ALWAYS PROFESSED HIMSELF AN OPPONENT OF THE WAR WHICH HAD SHATTERED HIS FANTASTIC DREAM OF A UNION BETWEEN THE TWO REPUBLICS MANY CONFERENCES TOOK PLACE BUT THE PROTECTOR'S ATTITUDE AND INTENTIONS WERE AMBIGUOUS AND DIFFICULT TO DIVINE
1081-125237-0077 AT LAST CROMWELL FORMULATED HIS PROPOSALS IN TWENTY SEVEN ARTICLES THE DEMANDS WERE THOSE OF THE VICTOR AND WERE SEVERE ALL THE OLD DISPUTES WERE TO BE SETTLED IN FAVOUR OF ENGLAND AN ANNUAL SUM WAS TO BE PAID FOR THE RIGHT OF FISHING
1081-125237-0078 COMPENSATION TO BE MADE FOR THE MASSACRE OF AMBOINA AND THE OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT PUNISHED THE NUMBER OF WARSHIPS IN ENGLISH WATERS WAS TO BE LIMITED THE FLAG HAD TO BE STRUCK WHEN ENGLISH SHIPS WERE MET AND THE RIGHT OF SEARCH TO BE PERMITTED THESE DEMANDS
1081-125237-0079 ARTICLE TWELVE STIPULATED THAT THE PRINCE OF ORANGE SHOULD NOT AT ANY TIME HOLD ANY OF THE OFFICES OR DIGNITIES WHICH HAD BEEN HELD BY HIS ANCESTORS OR BE APPOINTED TO ANY MILITARY COMMAND
1081-125237-0080 WAS PERFECTLY AWARE THAT IT WOULD BE USELESS TO PRESENT SUCH PROPOSALS TO THE STATES GENERAL NOT ONLY WOULD THEY INDIGNANTLY REJECT THEM BUT HE HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST HOPE OF GETTING ANY SINGLE PROVINCE EVEN HOLLAND TO ALLOW A FOREIGN POWER TO INTERFERE WITH THEIR INTERNAL AFFAIRS
1081-125237-0081 AND TO BID THEM TO TREAT WITH HARSH INGRATITUDE THE INFANT HEIR OF A FAMILY TO WHICH THE DUTCH PEOPLE OWED SO DEEP A DEBT THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO PREPARE FOR A VIGOROUS RESUMPTION OF THE WAR STRONG EFFORTS WERE THEREFORE MADE AT DE WITT'S INSTIGATION
1081-125237-0082 TO INCREASE THE FLEET AND SECURE THE ACTIVE CO OPERATION OF DENMARK AND FRANCE BOTH FRIENDLY TO THE STATES BUT CROMWELL REALLY WANTED PEACE AND SHOWED HIMSELF READY TO YIELD ON CERTAIN MINOR POINTS BUT HE CONTINUED TO INSIST ON THE EXCLUSION OF THE PRINCE OF ORANGE
1081-125237-0083 NOT TILL THE DUTCH ENVOYS HAD DEMANDED THEIR PASSPORTS DID THE PROTECTOR GIVE WAY SO FAR AS TO SAY HE WOULD BE CONTENT TO HAVE THE EXCLUSION GUARANTEED BY A SECRET ARTICLE WHAT FOLLOWED FORMS ONE OF THE STRANGEST CHAPTERS IN THE HISTORY OF DIPLOMACY
1081-125237-0084 HE WAS ABLE TO REACH THE PRIVATE EAR OF CROMWELL AND TO ENTER INTO CLANDESTINE NEGOTIATIONS WITH HIM THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY KNEW WELL THE HOPELESSNESS OF ANY ATTEMPT TO GET THE ASSENT OF THE STATES GENERAL TO THE PROPOSED EXCLUSION EVEN IN A SECRET ARTICLE
1081-125237-0085 OF THE STATE OF PUBLIC FEELING ON THIS POINT WITH THE RESULT THAT THE PROTECTOR GAVE THE ENVOY TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE WOULD BE SATISFIED IF THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND ALONE WOULD AFFIRM A DECLARATION THAT THE PRINCE SHOULD NEVER BE APPOINTED STADHOLDER OR CAPTAIN GENERAL WHETHER THIS CONCESSION WAS OFFERED BY CROMWELL PROPRIO MOTU
1081-125237-0086 IN ANY CASE THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY BEING CONVINCED OF THE NECESSITY OF PEACE RESOLVED TO SECURE IT BY PLAYING A VERY DEEP AND DANGEROUS GAME NOT ONLY MUST THE WHOLE AFFAIR BE KEPT ABSOLUTELY FROM THE COGNISANCE OF THE STATES GENERAL
1081-125237-0087 BUT ALSO DE WITT WAS FULLY AWARE THAT THE ASSENT OF THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND TO THE PROPOSED EXCLUSION ARTICLE COULD ONLY BE OBTAINED WITH THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY HE WAS TO PROVE HIMSELF A VERY PAST MASTER IN THE ART OF DIPLOMATIC CHICANERY AND INTRIGUE
1081-125237-0088 THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY FIRST SET TO WORK TO HAVE THE TREATY FROM WHICH THE EXCLUSION ARTICLE HAD BEEN CUT OUT RATIFIED RAPIDLY BY THE STATES GENERAL
1081-125237-0089 THE ESTATES ADJOURNED FOR A RECESS ON APRIL TWENTY FIRST SIXTEEN FIFTY FOUR ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HE PRESENTED THE TREATY TO THE STATES GENERAL
1081-125237-0090 AND SUCH WAS HIS PERSUASIVE SKILL THAT HE ACCOMPLISHED THE UNPRECEDENTED FEAT OF GETTING THIS DILATORY BODY TO ACCEPT THE CONDITIONS OF PEACE ALMOST WITHOUT DISCUSSION
1081-125237-0091 THE TREATY RATIFIED AND SIGNED WAS SENT BACK TO LONDON ONLY ONE ARTICLE AROUSED OPPOSITION
1081-125237-0092 THE SO CALLED TEMPERAMENT CLAUSE BUT CROMWELL HAD INSISTED UPON IT BY THIS ARTICLE
1081-125237-0093 OR COMMANDER OF MILITARY OR NAVAL FORCES
1081-125237-0094 ADDRESSED TO THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND NOT AT THE MOMENT IN SESSION
1081-125237-0095 THE CLEVERNESS AND SKILL NOW SHOWN BY THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY WERE TRULY EXTRAORDINARY A SUMMONS WAS SENT OUT TO THE ESTATES TO MEET ON APRIL TWENTY EIGHTH WITHOUT ANY REASON BEING ASSIGNED THE MEMBERS ON ASSEMBLY WERE SWORN TO SECRECY
1081-125237-0096 AND THEN THE OFFICIAL LETTER FROM LONDON WAS READ TO THEM
1081-125237-0097 TO THE ACT OF EXCLUSION CAME UPON THE ESTATES LIKE A THUNDER BOLT THE SUDDEN DEMAND CAUSED SOMETHING LIKE CONSTERNATION AND THE MEMBERS ASKED TO BE ALLOWED TO CONSIDER THE MATTER WITH THEIR PRINCIPALS BEFORE TAKING SO MOMENTOUS A DECISION THREE DAYS WERE GRANTED
1081-125237-0098 BUT AS IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO PREVENT PUBLICITY IT WAS SETTLED THAT ONLY THE BURGOMASTERS SHOULD BE CONSULTED AGAIN UNDER OATH OF SECRECY AT THE MEETING ON MAY FIRST
1081-125237-0099 THAT THE ACT SHOULD BE PLACED IN HIS HANDS WITHIN TWO DAYS AFTER THE RATIFICATION OF THE TREATY WAS PEREMPTORY AND THREATENING UNLESS HE RECEIVED THE ACT HE WOULD CONSIDER THE TREATY AS NOT BINDING UPON HIM USING ALL HIS POWERS OF ADVOCACY
1081-125237-0100 DE WITT SUCCEEDED AFTER AN ANGRY DEBATE IN SECURING A MAJORITY FOR THE ACT FIVE TOWNS HOWEVER OBSTINATELY REFUSED THEIR ASSENT AND CLAIMED THAT IT COULD NOT BE PASSED WITHOUT IT BUT DE WITT HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO RISK ILLEGALITY
1081-125237-0101 AND OVERRULED THEIR PROTEST THE ACT WAS DECLARED TO HAVE BEEN PASSED AND WAS ON MAY FIFTH SENT TO VAN BEVERNINGH AND NIEUWPOORT WITH INSTRUCTIONS NOT TO DELIVER IT UNTIL CIRCUMSTANCES COMPELLED THEM TO DO SO
1081-125237-0102 BUT FOR SOME FIVE WEEKS THE EXISTENCE OF THE ACT WAS UNKNOWN TO THE STATES GENERAL AND DURING THAT PERIOD
1081-125237-0103 EARLY IN JUNE A BRIBE INDUCED ONE OF DE WITT'S CLERKS TO BETRAY THE SECRET TO COUNT WILLIAM FREDERICK THE NEWS SOON SPREAD AND LOUD WAS THE OUTCRY OF THE ORANGE PARTISANS AND OF THE TWO PRINCESSES WHO AT ONCE ADDRESSED A REMONSTRANCE TO THE STATES GENERAL
1081-125237-0104 ALL THE OTHER PROVINCES STRONGLY PROTESTED AGAINST THE ACTION OF THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND AND OF THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY DE WITT ATTEMPTED TO DEFEND HIMSELF AND THE ESTATES BY VAGUE STATEMENTS AVOIDING THE MAIN ISSUE BUT INSISTING THAT NOTHING ILLEGAL HAD BEEN DONE HIS EFFORTS WERE IN VAIN
1081-125237-0105 ALL THE SECRET INSTRUCTIONS THEY HAD RECEIVED FROM HOLLAND AND THE ACT OF EXCLUSION MEANWHILE THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND THEMSELVES FRIGHTENED AT THE CLAMOUR WHICH HAD BEEN AROUSED BEGAN TO SHOW SIGNS OF DEFECTION
1081-125237-0106 THEY WENT SO FAR AS TO PASS A VOTE OF THANKS TO THE ENVOYS FOR NOT HAVING DELIVERED THE ACT TO CROMWELL DE WITT'S POSITION APPEARED HOPELESS
1081-125237-0107 HIS EFFORTS TO PREVENT THE RESOLUTION OF THE STATES GENERAL FROM TAKING IMMEDIATE EFFECT PROVING UNAVAILING HE PUT FORWARD THE SUGGESTION THAT ON ACCOUNT OF ITS IMPORTANCE THE DESPATCH SHOULD BE SENT TO THE ENVOYS IN CIPHER
1081-125237-0108 THIS WAS AGREED TO AND ON JUNE SEVENTH THE DOCUMENT WAS DULY FORWARDED TO LONDON BY THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY
1081-125237-0109 INFORMING THEM THAT THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND ASSENTED TO THE REQUEST MADE BY THE STATES GENERAL AND THAT THEY WERE TO SEND BACK THE SECRET CORRESPONDENCE AND ALSO THE ACT IF IT WERE STILL UNDELIVERED THE RESULT ANSWERED TO HIS EXPECTATIONS
1081-125237-0110 WHILE THE CLERK WAS LABORIOUSLY DECIPHERING THE DESPATCH THE ENVOYS READ BETWEEN THE LINES OF DE WITT'S LETTER AND WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DELAY WENT TO WHITEHALL AND PLACED THE ACT IN CROMWELL'S HANDS THE STATES GENERAL HAD THUS NO ALTERNATIVE BETWEEN ACCEPTANCE OF THE FAIT ACCOMPLI
1081-125237-0111 AND THE RISK OF A RENEWAL OF THE WAR NO FURTHER ACTION WAS TAKEN AND THE PROTECTOR PROFESSED HIMSELF SATISFIED WITH A GUARANTEE OF SUCH DOUBTFUL VALIDITY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WITHHOLD ADMIRATION FROM DE WITT'S MARVELLOUS DIPLOMATIC DEXTERITY
1081-125237-0112 AND FROM THE SKILL AND COURAGE WITH WHICH HE ACHIEVED HIS END IN THE FACE OF OBSTACLES AND DIFFICULTIES THAT SEEMED INSURMOUNTABLE BUT FOR THE COURSE OF DOUBLE DEALING AND CHICANERY BY WHICH HE TRIUMPHED THE ONLY DEFENCE THAT CAN BE OFFERED IS THAT THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY
1081-125237-0113 REALLY BELIEVED THAT PEACE WAS AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY FOR HIS COUNTRY AND THAT PEACE COULD ONLY BE MAINTAINED AT THE COST OF THE ACT OF EXCLUSION
1081-125237-0114 THERE IS HOWEVER EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT DE WITT WAS PROMPTED TO TAKE THE RISKS HE DID BY PURELY PATRIOTIC MOTIVES AND NOT THROUGH SPITE AGAINST THE HOUSE OF ORANGE
1081-125237-0115 NOT MERELY BY THE ORANGE PARTISANS BUT BY POPULAR OPINION GENERALLY IN THE UNITED PROVINCES

1088-129236-0000 EVERY PROMISE OF THE SOUL HAS INNUMERABLE FULFILMENTS EACH OF ITS JOYS RIPENS INTO A NEW WANT NATURE UNCONTAINABLE FLOWING FORELOOKING
1088-129236-0001 IN THE FIRST SENTIMENT OF KINDNESS ANTICIPATES ALREADY A BENEVOLENCE WHICH SHALL LOSE ALL PARTICULAR REGARDS IN ITS GENERAL LIGHT THE INTRODUCTION TO THIS FELICITY IS IN A PRIVATE AND TENDER RELATION OF ONE TO ONE WHICH IS THE ENCHANTMENT OF HUMAN LIFE
1088-129236-0002 UNITES HIM TO HIS RACE PLEDGES HIM TO THE DOMESTIC AND CIVIC RELATIONS CARRIES HIM WITH NEW SYMPATHY INTO NATURE ENHANCES THE POWER OF THE SENSES OPENS THE IMAGINATION ADDS TO HIS CHARACTER HEROIC AND SACRED ATTRIBUTES
1088-129236-0003 ESTABLISHES MARRIAGE AND GIVES PERMANENCE TO HUMAN SOCIETY THE NATURAL ASSOCIATION OF THE SENTIMENT OF LOVE WITH THE HEYDAY OF THE BLOOD SEEMS TO REQUIRE THAT IN ORDER TO PORTRAY IT IN VIVID TINTS WHICH EVERY YOUTH AND MAID SHOULD CONFESS TO BE TRUE TO THEIR THROBBING EXPERIENCE
1088-129236-0004 ONE MUST NOT BE TOO OLD THE DELICIOUS FANCIES OF YOUTH REJECT THE LEAST SAVOR OF A MATURE PHILOSOPHY AS CHILLING WITH AGE AND PEDANTRY THEIR PURPLE BLOOM
1088-129236-0005 AND THEREFORE I KNOW I INCUR THE IMPUTATION OF UNNECESSARY HARDNESS AND STOICISM FROM THOSE WHO COMPOSE THE COURT AND PARLIAMENT OF LOVE BUT FROM THESE FORMIDABLE CENSORS I SHALL APPEAL TO MY SENIORS
1088-129236-0006 FOR IT IS TO BE CONSIDERED THAT THIS PASSION OF WHICH WE SPEAK THOUGH IT BEGIN WITH THE YOUNG YET FORSAKES NOT THE OLD OR RATHER SUFFERS NO ONE WHO IS TRULY ITS SERVANT TO GROW OLD
1088-129236-0007 GLOWS AND ENLARGES UNTIL IT WARMS AND BEAMS UPON MULTITUDES OF MEN AND WOMEN UPON THE UNIVERSAL HEART OF ALL AND SO LIGHTS UP THE WHOLE WORLD AND ALL NATURE WITH ITS GENEROUS FLAMES
1088-129236-0008 ONLY IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT BY PATIENCE AND THE MUSES AID WE MAY ATTAIN TO THAT INWARD VIEW OF THE LAW WHICH SHALL DESCRIBE A TRUTH EVER YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL SO CENTRAL THAT IT SHALL COMMEND ITSELF TO THE EYE AT WHATEVER ANGLE BEHOLDEN
1088-129236-0009 AND THE FIRST CONDITION IS THAT WE MUST LEAVE A TOO CLOSE AND LINGERING ADHERENCE TO FACTS AND STUDY THE SENTIMENT AS IT APPEARED IN HOPE AND NOT IN HISTORY FOR EACH MAN SEES HIS OWN LIFE DEFACED AND DISFIGURED
1088-129236-0010 WHICH HAVE GIVEN HIM SINCEREST INSTRUCTION AND NOURISHMENT HE WILL SHRINK AND MOAN ALAS I KNOW NOT WHY BUT INFINITE COMPUNCTIONS EMBITTER IN MATURE LIFE THE REMEMBRANCES OF BUDDING JOY AND COVER EVERY BELOVED NAME
1088-129236-0011 DWELL CARE AND CANKER AND FEAR WITH THOUGHT WITH THE IDEAL IS IMMORTAL HILARITY THE ROSE OF JOY ROUND IT ALL THE MUSES SING BUT GRIEF CLEAVES TO NAMES AND PERSONS AND THE PARTIAL INTERESTS OF TO DAY AND YESTERDAY
1088-129236-0012 THE STRONG BENT OF NATURE IS SEEN IN THE PROPORTION WHICH THIS TOPIC OF PERSONAL RELATIONS USURPS IN THE CONVERSATION OF SOCIETY WHAT DO WE WISH TO KNOW OF ANY WORTHY PERSON SO MUCH AS HOW HE HAS SPED IN THE HISTORY OF THIS SENTIMENT
1088-129236-0013 AND WHAT FASTENS ATTENTION IN THE INTERCOURSE OF LIFE LIKE ANY PASSAGE BETRAYING AFFECTION BETWEEN TWO PARTIES PERHAPS WE NEVER SAW THEM BEFORE AND NEVER SHALL MEET THEM AGAIN BUT WE SEE THEM EXCHANGE A GLANCE OR BETRAY A DEEP EMOTION AND WE ARE NO LONGER STRANGERS
1088-129236-0014 IT IS THE DAWN OF CIVILITY AND GRACE IN THE COARSE AND RUSTIC THE RUDE VILLAGE BOY TEASES THE GIRLS ABOUT THE SCHOOL HOUSE DOOR BUT TO DAY HE COMES RUNNING INTO THE ENTRY AND MEETS ONE FAIR CHILD DISPOSING HER SATCHEL
1088-129236-0015 HE HOLDS HER BOOKS TO HELP HER AND INSTANTLY IT SEEMS TO HIM AS IF SHE REMOVED HERSELF FROM HIM INFINITELY AND WAS A SACRED PRECINCT AMONG THE THRONG OF GIRLS HE RUNS RUDELY ENOUGH BUT ONE ALONE DISTANCES HIM
1088-129236-0016 FOR PERSONS ARE LOVE'S WORLD AND THE COLDEST PHILOSOPHER CANNOT RECOUNT THE DEBT OF THE YOUNG SOUL WANDERING HERE IN NATURE TO THE POWER OF LOVE WITHOUT BEING TEMPTED TO UNSAY AS TREASONABLE TO NATURE AUGHT DEROGATORY TO THE SOCIAL INSTINCTS
1088-129236-0017 YET THE REMEMBRANCE OF THESE VISIONS OUTLASTS ALL OTHER REMEMBRANCES AND IS A WREATH OF FLOWERS ON THE OLDEST BROWS BUT HERE IS A STRANGE FACT IT MAY SEEM TO MANY MEN IN REVISING THEIR EXPERIENCE
1088-129236-0018 THAT THEY HAVE NO FAIRER PAGE IN THEIR LIFE'S BOOK THAN THE DELICIOUS MEMORY OF SOME PASSAGES WHEREIN AFFECTION CONTRIVED TO GIVE A WITCHCRAFT SURPASSING THE DEEP ATTRACTION OF ITS OWN TRUTH TO A PARCEL OF ACCIDENTAL AND TRIVIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
1088-129236-0019 NO MAN EVER FORGOT THE VISITATIONS OF THAT POWER TO HIS HEART AND BRAIN WHICH CREATED ALL THINGS ANEW WHICH WAS THE DAWN IN HIM OF MUSIC POETRY AND ART WHICH MADE THE FACE OF NATURE RADIANT WITH PURPLE LIGHT
1088-129236-0020 THE MORNING AND THE NIGHT VARIED ENCHANTMENTS WHEN A SINGLE TONE OF ONE VOICE COULD MAKE THE HEART BOUND AND THE MOST TRIVIAL CIRCUMSTANCE ASSOCIATED WITH ONE FORM IS PUT IN THE AMBER OF MEMORY
1088-129236-0021 WHEN NO PLACE IS TOO SOLITARY AND NONE TOO SILENT FOR HIM WHO HAS RICHER COMPANY AND SWEETER CONVERSATION IN HIS NEW THOUGHTS THAN ANY OLD FRIENDS THOUGH BEST AND PUREST CAN GIVE HIM FOR THE FIGURES THE MOTIONS
1088-129236-0022 THE WORDS OF THE BELOVED OBJECT ARE NOT LIKE OTHER IMAGES WRITTEN IN WATER BUT AS PLUTARCH SAID ENAMELLED IN FIRE AND MAKE THE STUDY OF MIDNIGHT THOU ART NOT GONE BEING GONE WHERE'ER THOU ART
1088-129236-0023 THY LOVING HEART IN THE NOON AND THE AFTERNOON OF LIFE WE STILL THROB AT THE RECOLLECTION OF DAYS WHEN HAPPINESS WAS NOT HAPPY ENOUGH BUT MUST BE DRUGGED WITH THE RELISH OF PAIN AND FEAR FOR HE TOUCHED THE SECRET OF THE MATTER WHO SAID OF LOVE
1088-129236-0024 ALL OTHER PLEASURES ARE NOT WORTH ITS PAINS AND WHEN THE DAY WAS NOT LONG ENOUGH BUT THE NIGHT TOO MUST BE CONSUMED IN KEEN RECOLLECTIONS WHEN THE HEAD BOILED ALL NIGHT ON THE PILLOW WITH THE GENEROUS DEED IT RESOLVED ON
1088-129236-0025 THE CLOUDS HAVE FACES AS HE LOOKS ON THEM THE TREES OF THE FOREST THE WAVING GRASS AND THE PEEPING FLOWERS HAVE GROWN INTELLIGENT AND HE ALMOST FEARS TO TRUST THEM WITH THE SECRET WHICH THEY SEEM TO INVITE YET NATURE SOOTHES AND SYMPATHIZES
1088-129236-0026 A MIDNIGHT BELL A PASSING GROAN THESE ARE THE SOUNDS WE FEED UPON BEHOLD THERE IN THE WOOD THE FINE MADMAN HE IS A PALACE OF SWEET SOUNDS AND SIGHTS HE DILATES HE IS TWICE A MAN
1088-129236-0027 HE WALKS WITH ARMS AKIMBO HE SOLILOQUIZES HE ACCOSTS THE GRASS AND THE TREES HE FEELS THE BLOOD OF THE VIOLET THE CLOVER AND THE LILY IN HIS VEINS AND HE TALKS WITH THE BROOK THAT WETS HIS FOOT
1088-129236-0028 THE HEATS THAT HAVE OPENED HIS PERCEPTIONS OF NATURAL BEAUTY HAVE MADE HIM LOVE MUSIC AND VERSE IT IS A FACT OFTEN OBSERVED THAT MEN HAVE WRITTEN GOOD VERSES UNDER THE INSPIRATION OF PASSION WHO CANNOT WRITE WELL UNDER ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES
1088-129236-0029 THE LIKE FORCE HAS THE PASSION OVER ALL HIS NATURE IT EXPANDS THE SENTIMENT IT MAKES THE CLOWN GENTLE AND GIVES THE COWARD HEART
1088-129236-0030 INTO THE MOST PITIFUL AND ABJECT IT WILL INFUSE A HEART AND COURAGE TO DEFY THE WORLD SO ONLY IT HAVE THE COUNTENANCE OF THE BELOVED OBJECT IN GIVING HIM TO ANOTHER IT STILL MORE GIVES HIM TO HIMSELF
1088-134315-0000 AS YOU KNOW AND AS I HAVE GIVEN YOU PROOF I HAVE THE GREATEST ADMIRATION IN THE WORLD FOR ONE WHOSE WORK FOR HUMANITY HAS WON SUCH UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION I HOPE THAT WE SHALL BOTH FORGET THIS UNHAPPY MORNING AND THAT YOU WILL GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY OF RENDERING TO YOU IN PERSON
1088-134315-0001 THE APOLOGIES WHICH ARE DUE TO YOU I FEEL THAT ANYTHING LESS WILL NEITHER REHABILITATE ME IN YOUR ESTEEM NOR SECURE FOR ME THE REMNANTS OF MY SHATTERED SELF RESPECT I AM HOPING YOU WILL DINE WITH ME NEXT WEEK AND MEET A MOST INTERESTING MAN GEORGE GATHERCOLE
1088-134315-0002 TO DISTURB A RELATIONSHIP WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS HOPED WOULD BE MUTUALLY PLEASANT IF YOU WILL ALLOW GATHERCOLE WHO WILL BE UNCONSCIOUS OF THE PART HE IS PLAYING TO ACT AS PEACEMAKER BETWEEN YOURSELF AND MYSELF

1088-134315-0006 IF HE EXPECTED HER TO GIVE HIM ANY ENCOURAGEMENT TO PROCEED HE WAS DISAPPOINTED PROBABLY HE REQUIRED NO SUCH ENCOURAGEMENT FOR IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS SOCIAL INFERIORS HE WAS SOMEWHAT MONOPOLIZING CUT A MAN'S FLESH AND IT HEALS HE SAID
1088-134315-0007 WHIP A MAN AND THE MEMORY OF IT PASSES FRIGHTEN HIM FILL HIM WITH A SENSE OF FOREBODING AND APPREHENSION AND LET HIM BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING DREADFUL IS GOING TO HAPPEN EITHER TO HIMSELF OR TO SOMEONE HE LOVES BETTER THE LATTER

1088-134315-0011 IF I CAN BUY IT WELL AND GOOD IF I CAN BUY THOSE WHO CAN USE THEIR INFLUENCE TO SECURE THIS THING FOR ME SO MUCH THE BETTER IF I CAN OBTAIN IT BY ANY MERIT I POSSESS I UTILIZE THAT MERIT
1088-134315-0012 PROVIDING ALWAYS THAT I CAN SECURE MY OBJECT IN THE TIME OTHERWISE HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS I SEE SHE SAID NODDING HER HEAD QUICKLY I SUPPOSE THAT IS HOW BLACKMAILERS FEEL HE FROWNED

1088-134315-0016 HE LIFTED HIS SHOULDERS WITH A DEPRECATING SMILE I SHALL CERTAINLY NOT DISCUSS YOUR BUSINESS WITH ANY PERSON SAID THE GIRL COLDLY I AM PAYING YOU THREE POUNDS A WEEK I THINK HE SAID
1088-134315-0017 I INTEND INCREASING THAT TO FIVE POUNDS BECAUSE YOU SUIT ME MOST ADMIRABLY THANK YOU SAID THE GIRL QUIETLY BUT I AM ALREADY BEING PAID QUITE SUFFICIENT SHE LEFT HIM A LITTLE ASTONISHED AND NOT A LITTLE RUFFLED
1088-134315-0018 TO REFUSE THE FAVOURS OF REMINGTON KARA WAS BY HIM REGARDED AS SOMETHING OF AN AFFRONT
1088-134315-0019 HE RANG THE BELL THIS TIME FOR HIS VALET FISHER HE SAID I AM EXPECTING A VISIT FROM A GENTLEMAN NAMED GATHERCOLE A ONE ARMED GENTLEMAN WHOM YOU MUST LOOK AFTER IF HE COMES

1088-134315-0024 THAT HE SHOULD RETURN TO KARA'S STUDY AND SET THE PAPERS IN ORDER WAS NATURAL AND PROPER THAT HE SHOULD CONDUCT A RAPID EXAMINATION OF ALL THE DRAWERS IN KARA'S DESK MIGHT BE EXCUSED ON THE SCORE OF DILIGENCE SINCE HE WAS TO SOME EXTENT IN THE CONFIDENCE OF HIS EMPLOYER
1088-134315-0025 KARA WAS GIVEN TO MAKING FRIENDS OF HIS SERVANTS UP TO A POINT IN HIS MORE GENEROUS MOMENTS HE WOULD ADDRESS HIS BODYGUARD AS FRED AND ON MORE OCCASIONS THAN ONE AND FOR NO APPARENT REASON HAD TIPPED HIS SERVANT OVER AND ABOVE HIS SALARY
1088-134315-0026 MISTER FRED FISHER FOUND LITTLE TO REWARD HIM FOR HIS SEARCH UNTIL HE CAME UPON KARA'S CHEQUE BOOK WHICH TOLD HIM THAT ON THE PREVIOUS DAY THE GREEK HAD DRAWN SIX THOUSAND POUNDS IN CASH FROM THE BANK
1088-134315-0027 THIS INTERESTED HIM MIGHTILY AND HE REPLACED THE CHEQUE BOOK WITH THE TIGHTENED LIPS AND THE FIXED GAZE OF A MAN WHO WAS THINKING RAPIDLY HE PAID A VISIT TO THE LIBRARY WHERE THE SECRETARY WAS ENGAGED IN MAKING COPIES OF KARA'S CORRESPONDENCE
1088-134315-0028 ANSWERING LETTERS APPEALING FOR CHARITABLE DONATIONS AND IN THE HACK WORDS WHICH FALL TO THE SECRETARIES OF THE GREAT HE REPLENISHED THE FIRE ASKED DEFERENTIALLY FOR ANY INSTRUCTIONS AND RETURNED AGAIN TO HIS QUEST

1088-134315-0037 EITHER BY LOOSENING HIS HOLD OF THE VOLUMES OR RAISING HIS HAND ACCIDENTALLY THE VALET'S HAND PRESSED AGAINST THE OTHER'S SLEEVE AND HE RECEIVED A SHOCK FOR THE FOREARM WAS CLEARLY AN ARTIFICIAL ONE IT WAS AGAINST A WOODEN SURFACE BENEATH THE SLEEVE THAT HIS KNUCKLES STRUCK
1088-134315-0038 AND THIS VIEW OF THE STRANGER'S INFIRMITY WAS CONFIRMED WHEN THE OTHER REACHED ROUND WITH HIS RIGHT HAND TOOK HOLD OF THE GLOVED LEFT HAND AND THRUST IT INTO THE POCKET OF HIS OVERCOAT WHERE IS KARA GROWLED THE STRANGER

1088-134315-0046 SHE HANDED HIM THE LETTER AND HE READ WITHOUT A DROOP OF EYELID THE SUPERSCRIPTION
1088-134315-0047 SPECIAL SERVICE DEPARTMENT SCOTLAND YARD WHITEHALL HE PUT IT CAREFULLY IN HIS POCKET AND WENT FROM THE ROOM TO CHANGE LARGE AS THE HOUSE WAS KARA DID NOT EMPLOY A REGULAR STAFF OF SERVANTS A MAID AND A VALET COMPRISED THE WHOLE OF THE INDOOR STAFF
1088-134315-0048 THE ONLY OTHER PERSON IN THE HOUSE BESIDE THE GIRL WAS THE MIDDLE AGED DOMESTIC WHO WAS PARLOUR MAID SERVING MAID AND HOUSEKEEPER IN ONE MISS HOLLAND SAT AT HER DESK TO ALL APPEARANCE READING OVER THE LETTERS SHE HAD TYPED THAT AFTERNOON
1088-134315-0049 BUT HER MIND WAS VERY FAR FROM THE CORRESPONDENCE BEFORE HER SHE HEARD THE SOFT THUD OF THE FRONT DOOR CLOSING AND RISING SHE CROSSED THE ROOM RAPIDLY AND LOOKED DOWN THROUGH THE WINDOW TO THE STREET SHE WATCHED FISHER UNTIL HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT
1088-134315-0050 THE MAID WHO WAS ALSO COOK AROSE UP AS THE GIRL ENTERED IT'S A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES TO SEE YOU IN MY KITCHEN MISS SHE SMILED I'M AFRAID YOU'RE RATHER LONELY MISSUS BEALE SAID THE GIRL SYMPATHETICALLY LONELY MISS CRIED THE MAID

1088-134315-0052 I KNOW HE GOES IN SOMETIMES BECAUSE I TRIED A DODGE THAT MY BROTHER WHO'S A POLICEMAN TAUGHT ME I STRETCHED A BIT OF WHITE COTTON ACROSS IT AN IT WAS BROKE THE NEXT MORNING MISTER KARA KEEPS SOME OF HIS PRIVATE PAPERS IN THERE SAID THE GIRL QUIETLY HE HAS TOLD ME SO HIMSELF

1088-134315-0054 THE GIRL ASCENDED TO THE UPPER FLOOR AGAIN SHE WATCHED FROM THE WINDOW THE DISAPPEARING FIGURE ONCE OUT OF SIGHT MISS HOLLAND WENT TO WORK WITH A REMARKABLE DELIBERATION AND THOROUGHNESS FROM HER BAG SHE PRODUCED A SMALL PURSE AND OPENED IT
1088-134315-0055 IN THAT CASE WAS A NEW STEEL KEY
1088-134315-0056 IN TWO SECONDS IT WAS OPEN AND SHE WAS EXAMINING ITS CONTENTS IT WAS A LARGE SAFE OF THE USUAL TYPE THERE WERE FOUR STEEL DRAWERS FITTED AT THE BACK AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STRONG BOX
1088-134315-0057 AN EXAMINATION OF THE FIRST DRAWER DID NOT PRODUCE ALL THAT SHE HAD EXPECTED SHE RETURNED THE PAPERS TO THE DRAWER PUSHED IT TO AND LOCKED IT SHE GAVE HER ATTENTION TO THE SECOND DRAWER HER HAND SHOOK A LITTLE AS SHE PULLED IT OPEN
1088-134315-0058 IT WAS A SQUARE CASE COVERED IN RED MOROCCO LEATHER SHE INSERTED HER SHAKING HAND AND TOOK IT OUT WITH A TRIUMPHANT LITTLE CRY AT LAST SHE SAID ALOUD AND THEN A HAND GRASPED HER WRIST AND IN A PANIC SHE TURNED TO MEET THE SMILING FACE
1088-134318-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE KARA LAY BACK ON HIS DOWN PILLOWS WITH A SNEER ON HIS FACE AND HIS BRAIN VERY BUSY WHAT STARTED THE TRAIN OF THOUGHT HE DID NOT KNOW BUT AT THAT MOMENT HIS MIND WAS VERY FAR AWAY
1088-134318-0001 IT CARRIED HIM BACK A DOZEN YEARS TO A DIRTY LITTLE PEASANT'S CABIN ON THE HILLSIDE OUTSIDE DURAZZO TO THE LIVID FACE OF A YOUNG ALBANIAN CHIEF WHO HAD LOST AT KARA'S WHIM ALL THAT LIFE HELD FOR A MAN
1088-134318-0002 TO THE HATEFUL EYES OF THE GIRL'S FATHER WHO STOOD WITH FOLDED ARMS GLARING DOWN AT THE BOUND AND MANACLED FIGURE ON THE FLOOR TO THE SMOKE STAINED RAFTERS OF THIS PEASANT COTTAGE AND THE DANCING SHADOWS ON THE ROOF
1088-134318-0003 TO THAT TERRIBLE HOUR OF WAITING WHEN HE SAT BOUND TO A POST WITH A CANDLE FLICKERING AND SPLUTTERING LOWER AND LOWER TO THE LITTLE HEAP OF GUNPOWDER THAT WOULD START THE TRAIL TOWARD THE CLUMSY INFERNAL MACHINE UNDER HIS CHAIR
1088-134318-0004 HE REMEMBERED THE DAY WELL BECAUSE IT WAS CANDLEMAS DAY AND THIS WAS THE ANNIVERSARY HE REMEMBERED OTHER THINGS MORE PLEASANT
1088-134318-0005 HE REMEMBERED WITH A SAVAGE JOY THE SPECTACLE OF HIS WOULD BE ASSASSINS TWITCHING AND STRUGGLING ON THE GALLOWS AT PEZARA AND
1088-134318-0006 HAD T X RETURNED HE SLIPPED FROM THE BED AND WENT TO THE DOOR OPENED IT SLIGHTLY AND LISTENED T X WITH A SEARCH WARRANT MIGHT BE A SOURCE OF PANIC ESPECIALLY IF HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS HE HAD SATISFIED T X AND ALLAYED HIS SUSPICIONS
1088-134318-0007 KARA BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF AND HIS FACE WAS WREATHED IN SMILES WHY OF COURSE TELL HIM TO COME UP ASK HIM IF HE MINDS SEEING ME IN MY ROOM I TOLD HIM YOU WERE IN BED SIR AND HE USED SHOCKING LANGUAGE SAID FISHER KARA LAUGHED SEND HIM UP HE SAID
1088-134318-0008 YES SIR SAID THE SERVANT SUCH AN INSTRUCTION WAS REMARKABLY PLEASING TO HIM THERE WAS MUCH THAT HE HAD TO DO AND THAT NIGHT'S FREEDOM WOULD ASSIST HIM MATERIALLY PERHAPS KARA HESITATED PERHAPS YOU HAD BETTER WAIT UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK
1088-134318-0009 BRING ME UP SOME SANDWICHES AND A LARGE GLASS OF MILK OR BETTER STILL PLACE THEM ON A PLATE IN THE HALL VERY GOOD SIR SAID THE MAN AND WITHDREW DOWN BELOW THAT GROTESQUE FIGURE WITH HIS SHINY HAT AND HIS RAGGED BEARD WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE TESSELATED HALLWAY
1088-134318-0010 MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AND STARING AT THE VARIOUS OBJECTS IN THE HALL WITH A CERTAIN AMUSED ANTAGONISM MISTER KARA WILL SEE YOU SIR SAID FISHER OH SAID THE OTHER GLARING AT THE UNOFFENDING FISHER THAT'S VERY GOOD OF HIM
1088-134318-0011 YES SIR SAID FISHER LOOK HERE THE MAN THRUST OUT HIS FACE DO YOU SEE THOSE GREY HAIRS IN MY BEARD THE EMBARRASSED FISHER GRINNED IS IT GREY CHALLENGED THE VISITOR WITH A ROAR
1088-134318-0012 YES SIR SAID THE VALET HASTILY IS IT REAL GREY INSISTED THE VISITOR PULL ONE OUT AND SEE THE STARTLED FISHER DREW BACK WITH AN APOLOGETIC SMILE I COULDN'T THINK OF DOING A THING LIKE THAT SIR OH YOU COULDN'T SNEERED THE VISITOR
1088-134318-0013 THEN LEAD ON FISHER SHOWED THE WAY UP THE STAIRS THIS TIME THE TRAVELLER CARRIED NO BOOKS HIS LEFT ARM HUNG LIMPLY BY HIS SIDE AND FISHER PRIVATELY GATHERED THAT THE HAND HAD GOT LOOSE FROM THE DETAINING POCKET WITHOUT ITS OWNER BEING AWARE OF THE FACT
1088-134318-0014 HE PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR AND ANNOUNCED MISTER GATHERCOLE AND KARA CAME FORWARD WITH A SMILE TO MEET HIS AGENT WHO WITH TOP HAT STILL ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AND HIS OVERCOAT DANGLING ABOUT HIS HEELS MUST HAVE MADE A REMARKABLE PICTURE
1088-134318-0015 FISHER CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEM AND RETURNED TO HIS DUTIES IN THE HALL BELOW TEN MINUTES LATER HE HEARD THE DOOR OPENED AND THE BOOMING VOICE OF THE STRANGER CAME DOWN TO HIM FISHER WENT UP THE STAIRS TO MEET HIM AND FOUND HIM ADDRESSING THE OCCUPANT OF THE ROOM IN HIS OWN ECCENTRIC FASHION
1088-134318-0016 NO MORE PATAGONIA HE ROARED NO MORE TIERRA DEL FUEGO HE PAUSED CERTAINLY HE REPLIED TO SOME QUESTION BUT NOT PATAGONIA HE PAUSED AGAIN
1088-134318-0017 AND FISHER STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WONDERED WHAT HAD OCCURRED TO MAKE THE VISITOR SO GENIAL I SUPPOSE YOUR CHEQUE WILL BE HONOURED ALL RIGHT ASKED THE VISITOR SARDONICALLY AND THEN BURST INTO A LITTLE CHUCKLE OF LAUGHTER AS HE CAREFULLY CLOSED THE DOOR
1088-134318-0018 DAMN ALL GREEKS HE SAID JOVIALLY AND FISHER COULD DO NO MORE THAN SMILE REPROACHFULLY THE SMILE BEING HIS VERY OWN THE REPROACH BEING ON BEHALF OF THE MASTER WHO PAID HIM THE TRAVELLER TOUCHED THE OTHER ON THE CHEST WITH HIS RIGHT HAND NEVER TRUST A GREEK HE SAID
1088-134318-0019 ALWAYS GET YOUR MONEY IN ADVANCE IS THAT CLEAR TO YOU YES SIR SAID FISHER BUT I THINK YOU WILL ALWAYS FIND THAT MISTER KARA IS ALWAYS MOST GENEROUS ABOUT MONEY DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT MY POOR MAN SAID THE OTHER YOU
1088-134318-0020 AT THAT MOMENT THERE CAME FROM KARA'S ROOM A FAINT CLANG WHAT'S THAT ASKED THE VISITOR A LITTLE STARTLED MISTER KARA'S PUT DOWN HIS STEEL LATCH SAID FISHER WITH A SMILE WHICH MEANS THAT HE IS NOT TO BE DISTURBED UNTIL HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
1088-134318-0021 UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT ANY RATE HE'S A FUNK SNAPPED THE OTHER A BEASTLY FUNK HE STAMPED DOWN THE STAIRS AS THOUGH TESTING THE WEIGHT OF EVERY TREAD OPENED THE FRONT DOOR WITHOUT ASSISTANCE SLAMMED IT BEHIND HIM AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE NIGHT
1098-133695-0000 AS IF THE YOUNG LADY HAD BEEN IN A POSITION TO APPEAL TO IT BUT IN FACT THE BRITISH PUBLIC REMAINED FOR THE PRESENT PROFOUNDLY INDIFFERENT TO MISS ISABEL ARCHER WHOSE FORTUNE HAD DROPPED HER AS HER COUSIN SAID INTO THE DULLEST HOUSE IN ENGLAND
1098-133695-0001 HER GOUTY UNCLE RECEIVED VERY LITTLE COMPANY AND MISSUS TOUCHETT NOT HAVING CULTIVATED RELATIONS WITH HER HUSBAND'S NEIGHBOURS WAS NOT WARRANTED IN EXPECTING VISITS FROM THEM SHE HAD HOWEVER A PECULIAR TASTE SHE LIKED TO RECEIVE CARDS
1098-133695-0002 FOR WHAT IS USUALLY CALLED SOCIAL INTERCOURSE SHE HAD VERY LITTLE RELISH BUT NOTHING PLEASED HER MORE THAN TO FIND HER HALL TABLE WHITENED WITH OBLONG MORSELS OF SYMBOLIC PASTEBOARD SHE FLATTERED HERSELF THAT SHE WAS A VERY JUST WOMAN
1098-133695-0003 AND HAD MASTERED THE SOVEREIGN TRUTH THAT NOTHING IN THIS WORLD IS GOT FOR NOTHING SHE HAD PLAYED NO SOCIAL PART AS MISTRESS OF GARDENCOURT AND IT WAS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT IN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY A MINUTE ACCOUNT SHOULD BE KEPT OF HER COMINGS AND GOINGS
1098-133695-0004 BUT IT IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN THAT SHE DID NOT FEEL IT TO BE WRONG THAT SO LITTLE NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF THEM AND THAT HER FAILURE REALLY VERY GRATUITOUS TO MAKE HERSELF IMPORTANT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAD NOT MUCH TO DO WITH THE ACRIMONY OF HER ALLUSIONS TO HER HUSBAND'S ADOPTED COUNTRY
1098-133695-0005 ISABEL PRESENTLY FOUND HERSELF IN THE SINGULAR SITUATION OF DEFENDING THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION AGAINST HER AUNT
1098-133695-0006 ISABEL ALWAYS FELT AN IMPULSE TO PULL OUT THE PINS NOT THAT SHE IMAGINED THEY INFLICTED ANY DAMAGE ON THE TOUGH OLD PARCHMENT BUT BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO HER HER AUNT MIGHT MAKE BETTER USE OF HER SHARPNESS
1098-133695-0007 SHE WAS VERY CRITICAL HERSELF IT WAS INCIDENTAL TO HER AGE HER SEX AND HER NATIONALITY BUT SHE WAS VERY SENTIMENTAL AS WELL AND THERE WAS SOMETHING IN MISSUS TOUCHETT'S DRYNESS THAT SET HER OWN MORAL FOUNTAINS FLOWING NOW WHAT'S YOUR POINT OF VIEW
1098-133695-0008 SHE ASKED OF HER AUNT WHEN YOU CRITICISE EVERYTHING HERE YOU SHOULD HAVE A POINT OF VIEW YOURS DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AMERICAN YOU THOUGHT EVERYTHING OVER THERE SO DISAGREEABLE WHEN I CRITICISE I HAVE MINE IT'S THOROUGHLY AMERICAN
1098-133695-0009 THERE ARE AS MANY POINTS OF VIEW IN THE WORLD AS THERE ARE PEOPLE OF SENSE TO TAKE THEM YOU MAY SAY THAT DOESN'T MAKE THEM VERY NUMEROUS AMERICAN NEVER IN THE WORLD THAT'S SHOCKINGLY NARROW MY POINT OF VIEW THANK GOD IS PERSONAL
1098-133695-0010 ISABEL THOUGHT THIS A BETTER ANSWER THAN SHE ADMITTED IT WAS A TOLERABLE DESCRIPTION OF HER OWN MANNER OF JUDGING BUT IT WOULD NOT HAVE SOUNDED WELL FOR HER TO SAY SO
1098-133695-0011 WOULD SAVOUR OF IMMODESTY EVEN OF ARROGANCE
1098-133695-0012 WITH WHOM SHE TALKED A GREAT DEAL AND WITH WHOM HER CONVERSATION WAS OF A SORT THAT GAVE A LARGE LICENCE TO EXTRAVAGANCE HER COUSIN USED AS THE PHRASE IS TO CHAFF HER
1098-133695-0013 HE VERY SOON ESTABLISHED WITH HER A REPUTATION FOR TREATING EVERYTHING AS A JOKE AND HE WAS NOT A MAN TO NEGLECT THE PRIVILEGES SUCH A REPUTATION CONFERRED
1098-133695-0014 OF LAUGHING AT ALL THINGS BEGINNING WITH HIMSELF SUCH SLENDER FACULTY OF REVERENCE AS HE POSSESSED CENTRED WHOLLY UPON HIS FATHER FOR THE REST HE EXERCISED HIS WIT INDIFFERENTLY UPON HIS FATHER'S SON THIS GENTLEMAN'S WEAK LUNGS
1098-133695-0015 HIS USELESS LIFE HIS FANTASTIC MOTHER
1098-133695-0016 HIS ADOPTED AND HIS NATIVE COUNTRY HIS CHARMING NEW FOUND COUSIN I KEEP A BAND OF MUSIC IN MY ANTE ROOM HE SAID ONCE TO HER IT HAS ORDERS TO PLAY WITHOUT STOPPING IT RENDERS ME TWO EXCELLENT SERVICES
1098-133695-0017 IT KEEPS THE SOUNDS OF THE WORLD FROM REACHING THE PRIVATE APARTMENTS AND IT MAKES THE WORLD THINK THAT DANCING'S GOING ON WITHIN
1098-133695-0018 THE LIVELIEST WALTZES SEEMED TO FLOAT UPON THE AIR ISABEL OFTEN FOUND HERSELF IRRITATED BY THIS PERPETUAL FIDDLING
1098-133695-0019 AND ENTER THE PRIVATE APARTMENTS IT MATTERED LITTLE THAT HE HAD ASSURED HER THEY WERE A VERY DISMAL PLACE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO UNDERTAKE TO SWEEP THEM AND SET THEM IN ORDER IT WAS BUT HALF HOSPITALITY TO LET HER REMAIN OUTSIDE
1098-133695-0020 IT MUST BE SAID THAT HER WIT WAS EXERCISED TO A LARGE EXTENT IN SELF DEFENCE FOR HER COUSIN AMUSED HIMSELF WITH CALLING HER COLUMBIA AND ACCUSING HER OF A PATRIOTISM SO HEATED THAT IT SCORCHED HE DREW A CARICATURE OF HER
1098-133695-0021 IN THE FOLDS OF THE NATIONAL BANNER ISABEL'S CHIEF DREAD IN LIFE AT THIS PERIOD OF HER DEVELOPMENT WAS THAT SHE SHOULD APPEAR NARROW MINDED WHAT SHE FEARED NEXT AFTERWARDS WAS THAT SHE SHOULD REALLY BE SO BUT SHE NEVERTHELESS
1098-133695-0022 SHE WOULD BE AS AMERICAN AS IT PLEASED HIM TO REGARD HER AND IF HE CHOSE TO LAUGH AT HER SHE WOULD GIVE HIM PLENTY OF OCCUPATION SHE DEFENDED ENGLAND AGAINST HIS MOTHER BUT WHEN RALPH SANG ITS PRAISES ON PURPOSE AS SHE SAID TO WORK HER UP
1098-133695-0023 SHE FOUND HERSELF ABLE TO DIFFER FROM HIM ON A VARIETY OF POINTS IN FACT THE QUALITY OF THIS SMALL RIPE COUNTRY SEEMED AS SWEET TO HER AS THE TASTE OF AN OCTOBER PEAR
1098-133695-0024 AND HER SATISFACTION WAS AT THE ROOT OF THE GOOD SPIRITS WHICH ENABLED HER TO TAKE HER COUSIN'S CHAFF
1098-133695-0025 IF HER GOOD HUMOUR FLAGGED AT MOMENTS IT WAS NOT BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT HERSELF ILL USED BUT BECAUSE SHE SUDDENLY FELT SORRY FOR RALPH IT SEEMED TO HER HE WAS TALKING AS A BLIND AND HAD LITTLE HEART IN WHAT HE SAID
1098-133695-0026 I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU SHE OBSERVED TO HIM ONCE BUT I SUSPECT YOU'RE A GREAT HUMBUG THAT'S YOUR PRIVILEGE RALPH ANSWERED WHO HAD NOT BEEN USED TO BEING SO CRUDELY ADDRESSED I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CARE FOR
1098-133695-0027 I DON'T THINK YOU CARE FOR ANYTHING YOU DON'T REALLY CARE FOR ENGLAND WHEN YOU PRAISE IT YOU DON'T CARE FOR AMERICA EVEN WHEN YOU PRETEND TO ABUSE IT I CARE FOR NOTHING BUT YOU DEAR COUSIN SAID RALPH IF I COULD BELIEVE
1098-133695-0028 EVEN THAT I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD AH WELL I SHOULD HOPE SO THE YOUNG MAN EXCLAIMED ISABEL MIGHT HAVE BELIEVED IT AND NOT HAVE BEEN FAR FROM THE TRUTH HE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL ABOUT HER SHE WAS CONSTANTLY PRESENT TO HIS MIND
1098-133695-0029 AT A TIME WHEN HIS THOUGHTS HAD BEEN A GOOD DEAL OF A BURDEN TO HIM HER SUDDEN ARRIVAL WHICH PROMISED NOTHING AND WAS AN OPEN HANDED GIFT OF FATE HAD REFRESHED AND QUICKENED THEM GIVEN THEM WINGS AND SOMETHING TO FLY FOR
1098-133695-0030 POOR RALPH HAD BEEN FOR MANY WEEKS STEEPED IN MELANCHOLY HIS OUTLOOK HABITUALLY SOMBRE LAY UNDER THE SHADOW OF A DEEPER CLOUD
1098-133695-0031 THE OLD MAN HAD BEEN GRAVELY ILL IN THE SPRING AND THE DOCTORS HAD WHISPERED TO RALPH THAT ANOTHER ATTACK WOULD BE LESS EASY TO DEAL WITH JUST NOW HE APPEARED DISBURDENED OF PAIN BUT RALPH COULD NOT RID HIMSELF OF A SUSPICION THAT THIS WAS A SUBTERFUGE OF THE ENEMY
1098-133695-0032 WHO WAS WAITING TO TAKE HIM OFF HIS GUARD IF THE MANOEUVRE SHOULD SUCCEED THERE WOULD BE LITTLE HOPE OF ANY GREAT RESISTANCE RALPH HAD ALWAYS TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT HIS FATHER WOULD SURVIVE HIM THAT HIS OWN NAME WOULD BE THE FIRST GRIMLY CALLED
1098-133695-0033 THE FATHER AND SON HAD BEEN CLOSE COMPANIONS AND THE IDEA OF BEING LEFT ALONE WITH THE REMNANT OF A TASTELESS LIFE ON HIS HANDS WAS NOT GRATIFYING TO THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD ALWAYS AND TACITLY COUNTED UPON HIS ELDER'S HELP IN MAKING THE BEST OF A POOR BUSINESS
1098-133695-0034 AT THE PROSPECT OF LOSING HIS GREAT MOTIVE RALPH LOST INDEED HIS ONE INSPIRATION
1098-133695-0035 BUT WITHOUT THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF HIS FATHER'S SOCIETY HE SHOULD BARELY HAVE PATIENCE TO AWAIT HIS OWN TURN HE HAD NOT THE INCENTIVE OF FEELING THAT HE WAS INDISPENSABLE TO HIS MOTHER IT WAS A RULE WITH HIS MOTHER TO HAVE NO REGRETS
1098-133695-0036 HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF COURSE THAT IT HAD BEEN A SMALL KINDNESS TO HIS FATHER TO WISH THAT OF THE TWO THE ACTIVE RATHER THAN THE PASSIVE PARTY SHOULD KNOW THE FELT WOUND HE REMEMBERED THAT THE OLD MAN HAD ALWAYS TREATED HIS OWN FORECAST OF AN EARLY END AS A CLEVER FALLACY
1098-133695-0037 WHICH HE SHOULD BE DELIGHTED TO DISCREDIT SO FAR AS HE MIGHT BY DYING FIRST BUT OF THE TWO TRIUMPHS THAT OF REFUTING A SOPHISTICAL SON AND THAT OF HOLDING ON A WHILE LONGER TO A STATE OF BEING WHICH WITH ALL ABATEMENTS HE ENJOYED
1098-133695-0038 HE WONDERED WHETHER HE WERE HARBOURING LOVE FOR THIS SPONTANEOUS YOUNG WOMAN FROM ALBANY BUT HE JUDGED THAT ON THE WHOLE HE WAS NOT AFTER HE HAD KNOWN HER FOR A WEEK HE QUITE MADE UP HIS MIND TO THIS AND EVERY DAY HE FELT A LITTLE MORE SURE
1098-133695-0039 LORD WARBURTON HAD BEEN RIGHT ABOUT HER SHE WAS A REALLY INTERESTING LITTLE FIGURE RALPH WONDERED HOW THEIR NEIGHBOUR HAD FOUND IT OUT SO SOON AND THEN HE SAID IT WAS ONLY ANOTHER PROOF OF HIS FRIEND'S HIGH ABILITIES
1098-133695-0040 WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS GREATLY ADMIRED IF HIS COUSIN WERE TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN AN ENTERTAINMENT TO HIM RALPH WAS CONSCIOUS SHE WAS AN ENTERTAINMENT OF A HIGH ORDER A CHARACTER LIKE THAT HE SAID TO HIMSELF
1098-133695-0041 A REAL LITTLE PASSIONATE FORCE TO SEE AT PLAY IS THE FINEST THING IN NATURE IT'S FINER THAN THE FINEST WORK OF ART THAN A GREEK BAS RELIEF
1098-133695-0042 THAN A GOTHIC CATHEDRAL IT'S VERY PLEASANT TO BE SO WELL TREATED WHERE ONE HAD LEAST LOOKED FOR IT I HAD NEVER BEEN MORE BLUE MORE BORED THAN FOR A WEEK BEFORE SHE CAME I HAD NEVER EXPECTED LESS THAT ANYTHING PLEASANT WOULD HAPPEN
1098-133695-0043 A GREEK BAS RELIEF TO STICK OVER MY CHIMNEY PIECE THE KEY OF A BEAUTIFUL EDIFICE IS THRUST INTO MY HAND AND I'M TOLD TO WALK IN AND ADMIRE MY POOR BOY YOU'VE BEEN SADLY UNGRATEFUL
1098-133695-0044 AND NOW YOU HAD BETTER KEEP VERY QUIET AND NEVER GRUMBLE AGAIN THE SENTIMENT OF THESE REFLEXIONS WAS VERY JUST
1098-133695-0045 HIS COUSIN WAS A VERY BRILLIANT GIRL
1098-133695-0046 BUT SHE NEEDED THE KNOWING AND HIS ATTITUDE WITH REGARD TO HER THOUGH IT WAS CONTEMPLATIVE AND CRITICAL WAS NOT JUDICIAL HE SURVEYED THE EDIFICE FROM THE OUTSIDE AND ADMIRED IT GREATLY
1098-133695-0047 ISABEL'S ORIGINALITY WAS THAT SHE GAVE ONE AN IMPRESSION OF HAVING INTENTIONS OF HER OWN WHENEVER SHE EXECUTES THEM SAID RALPH MAY I BE THERE TO SEE IT DEVOLVED UPON HIM OF COURSE TO DO THE HONOURS OF THE PLACE
1098-133695-0048 AND HIS WIFE'S POSITION WAS THAT OF RATHER A GRIM VISITOR SO THAT IN THE LINE OF CONDUCT THAT OPENED ITSELF TO RALPH DUTY AND INCLINATION WERE HARMONIOUSLY MIXED HE WAS NOT A GREAT WALKER BUT HE STROLLED ABOUT THE GROUNDS WITH HIS COUSIN
1098-133695-0049 A PASTIME FOR WHICH THE WEATHER REMAINED FAVOURABLE WITH A PERSISTENCY NOT ALLOWED FOR IN ISABEL'S SOMEWHAT LUGUBRIOUS PREVISION OF THE CLIMATE AND IN THE LONG AFTERNOONS OF WHICH THE LENGTH WAS BUT THE MEASURE OF HER GRATIFIED EAGERNESS
1098-133695-0050 THEY TOOK A BOAT ON THE RIVER THE DEAR LITTLE RIVER AS ISABEL CALLED IT WHERE THE OPPOSITE SHORE SEEMED STILL A PART OF THE FOREGROUND OF THE LANDSCAPE OR DROVE OVER THE COUNTRY IN A PHAETON A LOW CAPACIOUS THICK WHEELED PHAETON
1098-133695-0051 BUT WHICH HE HAD NOW CEASED TO ENJOY ISABEL ENJOYED IT LARGELY AND HANDLING THE REINS IN A MANNER WHICH APPROVED ITSELF TO THE GROOM AS KNOWING WAS NEVER WEARY OF DRIVING HER UNCLE'S CAPITAL HORSES THROUGH WINDING LANES AND BYWAYS
1098-133695-0052 FULL OF THE RURAL INCIDENTS SHE HAD CONFIDENTLY EXPECTED TO FIND PAST COTTAGES THATCHED AND TIMBERED PAST ALE HOUSES LATTICED AND SANDED PAST PATCHES OF ANCIENT COMMON AND GLIMPSES OF EMPTY PARKS
1098-133695-0053 BETWEEN HEDGEROWS MADE THICK BY MIDSUMMER WHEN THEY REACHED HOME THEY USUALLY FOUND TEA HAD BEEN SERVED ON THE LAWN
1098-133695-0054 BUT THE TWO FOR THE MOST PART SAT SILENT THE OLD MAN WITH HIS HEAD BACK AND HIS EYES CLOSED HIS WIFE OCCUPIED WITH HER KNITTING AND WEARING THAT APPEARANCE OF RARE PROFUNDITY WITH WHICH SOME LADIES CONSIDER THE MOVEMENT OF THEIR NEEDLES
1098-133695-0055 ONE DAY HOWEVER A VISITOR HAD ARRIVED THE TWO YOUNG PERSONS AFTER SPENDING AN HOUR ON THE RIVER STROLLED BACK TO THE HOUSE AND PERCEIVED LORD WARBURTON SITTING UNDER THE TREES AND ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION
1098-133695-0056 OF WHICH EVEN AT A DISTANCE THE DESULTORY CHARACTER WAS APPRECIABLE WITH
1098-133695-0057 HE HAD DRIVEN OVER FROM HIS OWN PLACE WITH A PORTMANTEAU AND HAD ASKED AS THE FATHER AND SON OFTEN INVITED HIM TO DO FOR A DINNER AND A LODGING ISABEL SEEING HIM FOR HALF AN HOUR ON THE DAY OF HER ARRIVAL HAD DISCOVERED IN THIS BRIEF SPACE THAT SHE LIKED HIM
1098-133695-0058 HE HAD INDEED RATHER SHARPLY REGISTERED HIMSELF ON HER FINE SENSE AND SHE HAD THOUGHT OF HIM SEVERAL TIMES SHE HAD HOPED SHE SHOULD SEE HIM AGAIN HOPED TOO THAT SHE SHOULD SEE A FEW OTHERS GARDENCOURT WAS NOT DULL
1098-133695-0059 THE PLACE ITSELF WAS SOVEREIGN HER UNCLE WAS MORE AND MORE A SORT OF GOLDEN GRANDFATHER AND RALPH WAS UNLIKE ANY COUSIN SHE HAD EVER ENCOUNTERED HER IDEA OF COUSINS HAVING TENDED TO GLOOM THEN
1098-133695-0060 HER IMPRESSIONS WERE STILL SO FRESH AND SO QUICKLY RENEWED THAT THERE WAS AS YET HARDLY A HINT OF VACANCY IN THE VIEW BUT ISABEL HAD NEED TO REMIND HERSELF THAT SHE WAS INTERESTED IN HUMAN NATURE AND THAT HER FOREMOST HOPE IN COMING ABROAD
1098-133695-0061 HAD BEEN THAT SHE SHOULD SEE A GREAT MANY PEOPLE WHEN RALPH SAID TO HER AS HE HAD DONE SEVERAL TIMES I WONDER YOU FIND THIS ENDURABLE YOU OUGHT TO SEE SOME OF THE NEIGHBOURS AND SOME OF OUR FRIENDS
1098-133695-0062 THOUGH YOU WOULD NEVER SUPPOSE IT WHEN HE OFFERED TO INVITE WHAT HE CALLED A LOT OF PEOPLE AND MAKE HER ACQUAINTED WITH ENGLISH SOCIETY SHE ENCOURAGED THE HOSPITABLE IMPULSE AND PROMISED IN ADVANCE TO HURL HERSELF INTO THE FRAY
1098-133695-0063 LITTLE HOWEVER FOR THE PRESENT HAD COME OF HIS OFFERS AND IT MAY BE CONFIDED TO THE READER THAT IF THE YOUNG MAN DELAYED TO CARRY THEM OUT IT WAS BECAUSE HE FOUND THE LABOUR OF PROVIDING FOR HIS COMPANION BY NO MEANS SO SEVERE AS TO REQUIRE EXTRANEOUS HELP
1098-133695-0064 ISABEL HAD SPOKEN TO HIM VERY OFTEN ABOUT SPECIMENS IT WAS A WORD THAT PLAYED A CONSIDERABLE PART IN HER VOCABULARY SHE HAD GIVEN HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WISHED TO SEE ENGLISH SOCIETY ILLUSTRATED BY EMINENT CASES
1098-133695-0065 WELL NOW THERE'S A SPECIMEN HE SAID TO HER AS THEY WALKED UP FROM THE RIVERSIDE AND HE RECOGNISED LORD WARBURTON A SPECIMEN OF WHAT ASKED THE GIRL A SPECIMEN OF AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN DO YOU MEAN THEY'RE ALL LIKE HIM
1098-133695-0066 OH NO THEY'RE NOT ALL LIKE HIM
1098-133695-0067 SAID ISABEL BECAUSE I'M SURE HE'S NICE
1098-133695-0068 THE FORTUNATE LORD WARBURTON EXCHANGED A HANDSHAKE WITH OUR HEROINE AND HOPED SHE WAS VERY WELL BUT I NEEDN'T ASK THAT HE SAID SINCE YOU'VE BEEN HANDLING THE OARS I'VE BEEN ROWING A LITTLE ISABEL ANSWERED BUT HOW SHOULD YOU KNOW IT
1098-133695-0069 OH I KNOW HE DOESN'T ROW HE'S TOO LAZY SAID HIS LORDSHIP INDICATING RALPH TOUCHETT WITH A LAUGH HE HAS A GOOD EXCUSE FOR HIS LAZINESS ISABEL REJOINED LOWERING HER VOICE A LITTLE AH HE HAS A GOOD EXCUSE FOR EVERYTHING
1098-133695-0070 CRIED LORD WARBURTON STILL WITH HIS SONOROUS MIRTH MY EXCUSE FOR NOT ROWING IS THAT MY COUSIN ROWS SO WELL SAID RALPH SHE DOES EVERYTHING WELL SHE TOUCHES NOTHING THAT SHE DOESN'T ADORN
1098-133695-0071 IT MAKES ONE WANT TO BE TOUCHED MISS ARCHER LORD WARBURTON DECLARED
1098-133695-0072 WHO IF IT PLEASED HER TO HEAR IT SAID THAT HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE NUMEROUS WAS HAPPILY ABLE TO REFLECT THAT SUCH COMPLACENCY WAS NOT THE INDICATION OF A FEEBLE MIND INASMUCH AS THERE WERE SEVERAL THINGS IN WHICH SHE EXCELLED
1098-133695-0073 HAD AT LEAST THE ELEMENT OF HUMILITY THAT IT ALWAYS NEEDED TO BE SUPPORTED BY PROOF LORD WARBURTON NOT ONLY SPENT THE NIGHT AT GARDENCOURT BUT HE WAS PERSUADED TO REMAIN OVER THE SECOND DAY AND WHEN THE SECOND DAY WAS ENDED
1098-133695-0074 HE DETERMINED TO POSTPONE HIS DEPARTURE TILL THE MORROW DURING THIS PERIOD HE ADDRESSED MANY OF HIS REMARKS TO ISABEL WHO ACCEPTED THIS EVIDENCE OF HIS ESTEEM WITH A VERY GOOD GRACE SHE FOUND HERSELF LIKING HIM EXTREMELY
1098-133695-0075 THE FIRST IMPRESSION HE HAD MADE ON HER HAD HAD WEIGHT BUT AT THE END OF AN EVENING SPENT IN HIS SOCIETY SHE SCARCE FELL SHORT OF SEEING HIM THOUGH QUITE WITHOUT LURIDITY AS A HERO OF ROMANCE

1098-133695-0077 THAT AN INCIDENT HAD OCCURRED WHICH MIGHT HAVE SEEMED TO PUT HER GOOD HUMOUR TO THE TEST

118-121721-0027 BY STANDER ONE WHO IS INJURED IN A STREET FIGHT
118-124588-0000 MISSUS SAVAREEN SAT UP WAITING FOR HER LORD UNTIL LONG PAST MIDNIGHT BUT HER VIGIL WAS IN VAIN LAPIERRE AFTER CLOSING UP HIS INN FOR THE NIGHT DROPPED IN ACCORDING TO HIS PROMISE TO SEE IF ANY NEWS OF THE ABSENTEE HAD ARRIVED
118-124588-0001 NOTHING FURTHER COULD BE DONE IN THE WAY OF SEARCHING FOR THE LATTER PERSONAGE UNTIL DAYLIGHT IT WAS GETTING ON PRETTY WELL TOWARDS MORNING WHEN MISSUS SAVAREEN SOUGHT HER COUCH AND WHEN SHE GOT THERE HER SLUMBER WAS BROKEN AND DISTURBED SHE KNEW NOT WHAT TO THINK
118-124588-0002 BUT SHE WAS HAUNTED BY A DREAD THAT SHE WOULD NEVER AGAIN SEE HER HUSBAND ALIVE NEXT MORNING SOON AFTER DAYLIGHT THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS ASTIR AND THE COUNTRY ROUND WAS CAREFULLY SEARCHED FOR ANY TRACE OF THE MISSING MAN
118-124588-0003 SQUIRE HARRINGTON WENT DOWN TO TOWN AND MADE INQUIRIES AT THE BANK WHERE HE ASCERTAINED THAT THE STORY TOLD BY SAVAREEN TO OLD JONATHAN PERRY
118-124588-0004 WAS SUBSTANTIALLY CORRECT THIS EFFECTUALLY DISPOSED OF ANY POSSIBLE THEORY AS TO JONATHAN AND HIS WIFE HAVING MISTAKEN SOMEBODY ELSE FOR SAVAREEN SQUIRE HARRINGTON LIKEWISE LEARNED ALL ABOUT THE MAN'S DOINGS ON THE PREVIOUS AFTERNOON
118-124588-0005 AND WAS ABLE TO FIX THE TIME AT WHICH HE HAD STARTED FOR HOME HE HAD RIDDEN FROM THE DOOR OF THE PEACOCK AT ABOUT A QUARTER TO EIGHT
118-124588-0006 PERRY PROFESSED TO HAVE SEEN AND CONVERSED WITH HIM THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT THAT INTERVIEW AND CONVERSATION HAD ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING AND SAVAREEN HAD RIDDEN NORTHWARD FROM THE GATE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS HE COULD NOT HAVE PROCEEDED MORE THAN A HUNDRED
118-124588-0007 OR AT THE VERY OUTSIDE TWO HUNDRED YARDS FURTHER OR HE MUST INEVITABLY HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERED BY LAPIERRE
118-124588-0008 BUT THE HORSE WHICH HAD DISAPPEARED IN THIS UNACCOUNTABLE MANNER IT SEEMED IMPROBABLE THAT TWO LIVING SUBSTANCES OF SUCH BULK SHOULD PASS OUT OF BEING AND LEAVE NO TRACE BEHIND THEM THEY MUST LITERALLY HAVE MELTED INTO THIN AIR NO THEY HADN'T AT LEAST THE BLACK MARE HADN'T
118-124588-0009 FOR SHE WAS DISCOVERED BY SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE SEARCHING PARTY A LITTLE BEFORE NOON WHEN FOUND SHE WAS QUIETLY CROPPING THE DAMP HERBAGE AT THE EDGE OF THE CRANBERRY SWAMP AT THE REAR OF SQUIRE HARRINGTON'S FARM SHE WAS WHOLLY UNINJURED AND HAD EVIDENTLY SPENT THE NIGHT THERE
118-124588-0010 THE BIT HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM HER MOUTH BUT THE BRIDLE HUNG INTACT ROUND HER NECK THE SADDLE HOWEVER LIKE ITS OWNER HAD DISAPPEARED FROM HER BACK THEN THE MEN BEGAN A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH IN THE INTERIOR OF THE SWAMP THEY SOON CAME UPON THE SADDLE WHICH HAD APPARENTLY BEEN DELIBERATELY UNBUCKLED
118-124588-0011 AND DEPOSITED ON A DRY PATCH OF GROUND NEAR THE EDGE OF THE MORASS A LITTLE FURTHER IN THE INTERIOR THEY CAME UPON A MAN'S COAT MADE OF DARK BROWN STUFF
118-124588-0012 AS BELONG TO SAVAREEN IT WAS WET AND BESMIRCHED WITH MUD AND IN FACT WAS LYING HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF A LITTLE PUDDLE OF WATER WHEN IT WAS FOUND THEN THE SEARCHERS MADE SURE OF FINDING THE BODY BUT IN THIS THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED
118-124588-0013 BUT FOUND NOTHING FURTHER TO REWARD THEIR SEARCH THE GROUND WAS TOO SOFT AND MARSHY TO RETAIN ANY TRACES OF FOOTSTEPS AND THE MARE AND SADDLE FURNISHED THE ONLY EVIDENCE THAT THE OBJECT OF THEIR QUEST HAD BEEN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE SWAMP AND OF COURSE THIS EVIDENCE WAS OF THE MOST VAGUE AND INCONCLUSIVE CHARACTER
118-124588-0014 THEN THE PARTY PROCEEDED IN A BODY TO THE MISSING MAN'S HOUSE HERE ANOTHER SURPRISE AWAITED THEM THE COAT WAS AT ONCE RECOGNISED BY MISSUS SAVAREEN AS BELONGING TO HER HUSBAND BUT IT WAS NOT THE COAT WORN BY HIM AT THE TIME OF HIS DISAPPEARANCE OF THIS THERE WAS NO DOUBT WHATEVER
118-124588-0015 IN FACT HE HAD NOT WORN IT FOR MORE THAN A WEEK PREVIOUSLY HIS WIFE DISTINCTLY REMEMBERED HAVING FOLDED AND LAID IT AWAY IN THE TOP OF A LARGE TRUNK ON THE SATURDAY OF THE WEEK BEFORE LAST SINCE WHICH TIME SHE HAD NEVER SET EYES ON IT HERE WAS A DEEPENING OF THE MYSTERY
118-124588-0016 THE SEARCH WAS KEPT UP WITHOUT INTERMISSION FOR SEVERAL DAYS NEARLY ALL OF THE FARMERS IN THE VICINITY TAKING PART IN IT EVEN TO THE NEGLECT OF THE HARVEST WORK WHICH DEMANDED THEIR ATTENTION SQUIRE HARRINGTON WAS ESPECIALLY ACTIVE AND LEFT NO STONE UNTURNED TO UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY
118-124588-0017 LAPIERRE GAVE UP ALL HIS TIME TO THE SEARCH AND LEFT THE ROYAL OAK TO THE CARE OF ITS LANDLADY THE LOCAL CONSTABULARY BESTIRRED THEMSELVES AS THEY HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE
118-124588-0018 WHERE A MAN'S BODY MIGHT POSSIBLY LIE CONCEALED EVERY TRACT OF BUSH AND WOODLAND EVERY BARN AND OUT BUILDING EVERY HOLLOW AND DITCH EVERY FIELD AND FENCE CORNER WAS EXPLORED WITH CAREFUL MINUTENESS EVEN THE WELLS OF THE DISTRICT WERE PEERED INTO
118-124588-0019 FROM OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH DOCTOR SCOTT THE LOCAL CORONER HELD HIMSELF IN READINESS TO SUMMON A CORONER'S JURY AT THE SHORTEST NOTICE WHEN ALL THESE MEASURES PROVED UNAVAILING A PUBLIC MEETING OF THE INHABITANTS WAS CONVENED AND FUNDS WERE SUBSCRIBED TO STILL FURTHER PROSECUTE THE SEARCH
118-124588-0020 DEAD OR ALIVE OR WHICH SHOULD THROW ANY LIGHT UPON HIS FATE HAND BILLS PROCLAIMING THIS REWARD AND DESCRIBING THE MAN'S PERSONAL APPEARANCE WERE EXHIBITED IN EVERY BAR ROOM AND OTHER CONSPICUOUS PLACE THROUGHOUT WESTCHESTER AND THE ADJACENT TOWNSHIPS
118-124588-0021 ADVERTISEMENTS SETTING FORTH THE MAIN FACTS WERE INSERTED IN THE PRINCIPAL NEWSPAPERS OF TORONTO HAMILTON AND LONDON
118-47824-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN THE AMAZING MEETING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE OLD COURTYARD BOBBY RETURNED TO HIS BED HE LAY THERE STILL SHIVERING BENEATH THE HEAVY BLANKETS I DON'T DARE HE ECHOED GRAHAM'S WORDS THERE'S NOTHING ELSE ANY ONE CAN SAY
118-47824-0001 I MUST DECIDE WHAT TO DO I MUST THINK IT OVER BUT AS ALWAYS THOUGHT BROUGHT NO RELEASE IT MERELY INSISTED THAT THE CASE AGAINST HIM WAS PROVED AT LAST HE HAD BEEN SEEN SLIPPING UNCONSCIOUSLY FROM HIS ROOM AND AT THE SAME HOUR
118-47824-0002 ALL THAT REMAINED WAS TO LEARN HOW HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THE APPARENT MIRACLES
118-47824-0003 THE WOMAN AT THE LAKE AND IN THE COURTYARD THE MOVEMENT OF THE BODY AND THE VANISHING OF THE EVIDENCE UNDER HIS HAND PAREDES'S ODD BEHAVIOUR ALL BECAME IN HIS MIND PUZZLING DETAILS THAT FAILED TO OBSCURE THE CHIEF FACT
118-47824-0004 AFTER THIS SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT PAREDES'S DETENTION HE HADN'T DREAMED THAT HIS WEARINESS COULD PLACATE EVEN MOMENTARILY SUCH REFLECTIONS BUT AT LAST HE SLEPT AGAIN
118-47824-0005 HE WAS AROUSED BY THE TRAMPING OF MEN AROUND THE HOUSE AND STRANGE HARSH VOICES HE RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS ELBOW AND GLANCED FROM THE WINDOW IT HAD LONG BEEN DAYLIGHT TWO BURLY FELLOWS IN OVERALLS CARRYING PICK AND SPADE ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
118-47824-0006 PUSHED THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH AT THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING HE TURNED GRAHAM FULLY DRESSED STOOD AT THE SIDE OF THE BED THOSE MEN BOBBY ASKED WEARILY THE GRAVE DIGGERS GRAHAM ANSWERED THEY ARE GOING TO WORK IN THE OLD CEMETERY TO PREPARE A PLACE FOR SILAS BLACKBURN
118-47824-0007 THAT'S WHY I'VE COME TO WAKE YOU UP THE MINISTER'S TELEPHONED KATHERINE HE WILL BE HERE BEFORE NOON DO YOU KNOW IT'S AFTER TEN O'CLOCK FOR SOME TIME BOBBY STARED THROUGH THE WINDOW AT THE DESOLATE RAGGED LANDSCAPE IT WAS ABNORMALLY COLD EVEN FOR THE LATE FALL
118-47824-0008 DULL CLOUDS OBSCURED THE SUN AND FURNISHED AN ILLUSION OF CROWDING EARTHWARD A FUNEREAL DAY THE WORDS SLIPPED INTO HIS MIND HE REPEATED THEM WHEN YOUR GRANDFATHER'S BURIED GRAHAM ANSWERED SOFTLY WE'LL ALL FEEL HAPPIER WHY BOBBY ASKED
118-47824-0009 IT WON'T LESSEN THE FACT OF HIS MURDER TIME GRAHAM SAID LESSENS SUCH FACTS EVEN FOR THE POLICE BOBBY GLANCED AT HIM FLUSHING YOU MEAN YOU'VE DECIDED TO STAND BY ME AFTER WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT GRAHAM SMILED
118-47824-0010 I SLEPT LIKE A TOP LAST NIGHT I HEARD NOTHING I SAW NOTHING OUGHT I TO WANT YOU TO STAND BY ME BOBBY SAID OUGHTN'T I TO MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT
118-47824-0011 GRAHAM FROWNED IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE HE HAD ANY CONNECTION WITH YOUR SLEEP WALKING LAST NIGHT YET IT'S AS CLEAR AS EVER THAT MARIA AND HE ARE UP TO SOME GAME IN WHICH YOU FIGURE HE SHOULDN'T BE IN JAIL BOBBY PERSISTED GET UP GRAHAM ADVISED
118-47824-0012 BATHE AND HAVE SOME BREAKFAST THEN WE CAN DECIDE THERE'S NO USE TALKING OF THE OTHER THING I'VE FORGOTTEN IT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE YOU MUST BOBBY SPRANG UPRIGHT HOW CAN I FORGET IT
118-47824-0013 HAVE I ANY RIGHT DON'T GRAHAM SAID I'LL BE WITH YOU AGAIN TO NIGHT
118-47824-0014 WHEN BOBBY HAD BATHED AND DRESSED HE FOUND IN SPITE OF HIS MENTAL TURMOIL THAT HIS SLEEP HAD DONE HIM GOOD WHILE HE BREAKFASTED GRAHAM URGED HIM TO EAT TRIED TO DRIVE FROM HIS BRAIN THE MORBID AFTERMATH OF LAST NIGHT'S REVEALING MOMENT
118-47824-0015 THE MANAGER TOOK MY ADVICE BUT MARIA'S STILL MISSING
118-47824-0016 HE STROLLED OVER AND HANDED BOBBY A NUMBER OF NEWSPAPERS WHERE'S ROBINSON BOBBY ASKED I SAW HIM IN THE COURT A WHILE AGO I DARESAY HE'S WANDERING AROUND PERHAPS WATCHING THE MEN AT THE GRAVE HE LEARNED NOTHING NEW LAST NIGHT I WAS WITH HIM AT BREAKFAST I GATHER NOT
118-47824-0017 BOBBY LOOKED UP ISN'T THAT AN AUTOMOBILE COMING THROUGH THE WOODS HE ASKED MAYBE RAWLINS BACK FROM SMITHTOWN OR THE MINISTER THE CAR STOPPED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE COURT THEY HEARD THE REMOTE TINKLING OF THE FRONT DOOR BELL JENKINS PASSED THROUGH
118-47824-0018 HIS SHARP EXCLAMATION RECALLED HOWELLS'S REPORT WHICH AT THEIR DIRECTION HE HAD FAILED TO MAIL HAD HIS EXCLAMATION BEEN DRAWN BY AN ACCUSER BOBBY STARTED TO RISE GRAHAM MOVED TOWARD THE DOOR THEN JENKINS ENTERED AND STOOD TO ONE SIDE
118-47824-0019 THE FORMER EASY MANNERED UNCOMMUNICATIVE FOREIGNER HE APPEARED MOREOVER TO HAVE SLEPT PLEASANTLY HIS EYES SHOWED NO WEARINESS HIS CLOTHING NO DISARRANGEMENT HE SPOKE AT ONCE
118-47824-0020 OVERCOAT I'VE NEARLY FROZEN DRIVING FROM SMITHTOWN BEFORE EITHER MAN COULD GROPE FOR A SUITABLE GREETING HE FACED BOBBY
118-47824-0021 FACT IS BOBBY I LEFT NEW YORK TOO SUDDENLY
118-47824-0022 YOU SEE I SPENT A GOOD DEAL IN SMITHTOWN YESTERDAY
118-47824-0023 GRAHAM INTERRUPTED WITH A FLAT DEMAND FOR AN EXPLANATION HOW DID YOU GET AWAY
118-47824-0024 LATER MISTER GRAHAM THERE IS A HACK DRIVER OUTSIDE WHO IS EVEN MORE SUSPICIOUS THAN YOU HE WANTS TO BE PAID I ASKED RAWLINS TO DRIVE ME BACK BUT HE RUSHED FROM THE COURTHOUSE PROBABLY TO TELEPHONE HIS ROTUND SUPERIOR
118-47824-0025 BOBBY HANDED HIM A BANKNOTE HE DIDN'T MISS GRAHAM'S MEANING GLANCE
118-47824-0026 PAY HIM WILL YOU JENKINS THANKS
118-47824-0027 WHY HE SHOULD FAIL TO REFER TO BOBBY'S QUESTIONS AT THE MOMENT OF HIS ARREST OR TO THE OPENLY EXPRESSED ENMITY OF GRAHAM ONLY ONE THEORY PROMISED TO FIT AT ALL IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PANAMANIAN TO RETURN TO THE CEDARS
118-47824-0028 COMPELLED HIM TO REMAIN FOR THE PRESENT IN THE MOURNFUL TRAGIC HOUSE THEREFORE HE WOULD CRUSH HIS JUSTIFIABLE ANGER
118-47824-0029 AND HE HAD ASKED FOR MONEY ONLY A TRIFLING SUM YET GRAHAM WOULD GRASP AT THE FACT TO SUPPORT HIS EARLIER SUSPICION PAREDES'S ARRIVAL POSSESSED ONE VIRTUE IT DIVERTED BOBBY'S THOUGHTS TEMPORARILY FROM HIS OWN DILEMMA FROM HIS INABILITY TO CHART A COURSE
118-47824-0030 GRAHAM ON THE OTHER HAND WAS ILL AT EASE
118-47824-0031 FOR HIM YESTERDAY'S INCIDENT WAS NOT SO LIGHTLY TO BE PASSED OVER EVENTUALLY HIS CURIOSITY CONQUERED THE WORDS CAME NEVERTHELESS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
118-47824-0032 WE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED YOU WOULD FIND IT NECESSARY TO STAY IN SMITHTOWN FOR A WHILE
118-47824-0033 SIMPLE ENOUGH MISTER GRAHAM I TELEPHONED AS SOON AS RAWLINS GOT ME TO THE BASTILLE I COMMUNICATED WITH THE LAWYER WHO REPRESENTS THE COMPANY FOR WHICH I ONCE WORKED HE'S A PROMINENT AND BRILLIANT MAN HE PLANNED IT WITH SOME LOCAL FELLOW WHEN I WAS ARRAIGNED AT THE OPENING OF COURT THIS MORNING
118-47824-0034 THE JUDGE COULD HOLD ME ONLY AS A MATERIAL WITNESS HE FIXED A PRETTY STIFF BAIL BUT THE LOCAL LAWYER WAS THERE WITH A BONDSMAN AND I CAME BACK MY CLOTHES ARE HERE YOU DON'T MIND BOBBY THAT MOMENT IN THE HALL WHEN GRAHAM HAD AWAKENED HIM URGED BOBBY TO REPLY WITH A GENUINE WARMTH
118-47824-0035 I DON'T MIND I'M GLAD YOU'RE OUT OF IT
118-47824-0036 YOUR PRESENCE IN THE PRIVATE STAIRCASE WAS THE LAST STRAW YOU WILL FORGIVE US CARLOS
118-47824-0037 HE SMOKED WITH A VAST CONTENTMENT THAT'S BETTER NOTHING TO FORGIVE BOBBY LET US CALL IT A MISUNDERSTANDING GRAHAM MOVED CLOSER
118-47824-0038 HIS EYES STILL SMILED BUT HIS VOICE WAS HARDER BYGONES ARE BYGONES ISN'T THAT SO BOBBY SINCE YOU WISH IT BOBBY SAID BUT MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE KNOWLEDGE GRAHAM DESIRED LOOMED THE OLD QUESTION WHAT WAS THE MAN'S GAME WHAT HELD HIM HERE
118-47824-0039 ROBINSON ENTERED THE FLESH AROUND HIS EYES WAS PUFFIER THAN IT HAD BEEN YESTERDAY WORRY HAD INCREASED THE INCONGRUOUS DISCONTENT OF HIS ROUND FACE CLEARLY HE HAD SLEPT LITTLE I SAW YOU ARRIVE HE SAID RAWLINS WARNED ME
118-47824-0040 BUT I MUST SAY I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D USE YOUR FREEDOM TO COME TO US
118-47824-0041 SINCE THE LAW WON'T HOLD ME AT YOUR CONVENIENCE IN SMITHTOWN I KEEP MYSELF AT YOUR SERVICE HERE IF BOBBY PERMITS IT COULD YOU ASK MORE BOBBY SHRANK FROM THE MAN WITH WHOM HE HAD IDLED AWAY SO MUCH TIME AND MONEY
118-47824-0042 THAT FLEETING SATANIC IMPRESSION OF YESTERDAY CAME BACK SHARPER MORE ALARMING PAREDES'S CLEAR CHALLENGE TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WAS THE MEASURE OF HIS STRENGTH HIS MIND WAS SUBTLER THAN THEIRS
118-47824-0043 HIS RESERVE AND EASY DARING MASTERED THEM ALL AND ALWAYS AS NOW HE LAUGHED AT THE FUTILITY OF THEIR EFFORTS TO SOUND HIS PURPOSES TO LIMIT HIS FREEDOM OF ACTION BOBBY DIDN'T CARE TO MEET THE UNCOMMUNICATIVE EYES WHOSE DEPTHS HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO EXPLORE
118-47824-0044 THAT MIGHT MAKE MEN WALK UNCONSCIOUSLY TO ACCOMPLISH THE ENDS OF AN UNSCRUPULOUS BRAIN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY APPEARED AS MUCH AT SEA AS THE OTHERS
118-47824-0045 AND GLANCING AT BOBBY HE ASKED WITH A HOLLOW SCORN YOU'VE NO OBJECTION TO THE GENTLEMAN VISITING YOU FOR THE PRESENT IF HE WISHES BOBBY ANSWERED
118-47824-0046 ROBINSON JERKED HIS HEAD TOWARD THE WINDOW I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE PREPARATIONS OUT THERE
118-47824-0047 NO HURRY BOBBY ANSWERED WITH A QUICK INTAKE OF BREATH I SUPPOSE NOT ROBINSON SNEERED SINCE EVERYBODY KNOWS WELL ENOUGH WHAT'S IN IT BOBBY AROSE ROBINSON STILL SNEERED YOU'LL BE AT THE GRAVE AS CHIEF MOURNER
118-47824-0048 BOBBY WALKED FROM THE ROOM HE HADN'T CARED TO REPLY HE FEARED AS IT WAS THAT HE HAD LET SLIP HIS INCREASED SELF DOUBT HE PUT ON HIS COAT AND HAT AND LEFT THE HOUSE THE RAW COLD THE YEAR'S FIRST OMEN OF WINTER MADE HIS BLOOD RUN QUICKER
118-47824-0049 FORCED INTO HIS MIND A CLEANSING STIMULATION BUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY EVEN THAT PROPHYLACTIC WAS DENIED HIM WITH HIS DIRECTION A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE CHANCE LED HIM INTO THE THICKET AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE HE HAD WALKED SOME DISTANCE
118-47824-0050 THE UNDERBRUSH HAD LONG INTERPOSED A VEIL BETWEEN HIM AND THE CEDARS ABOVE WHOSE ROOFS SMOKE WREATHED IN THE STILL AIR LIKE FANTASTIC FIGURES WEAVING A SHROUD TO LOWER OVER THE TIME STAINED MELANCHOLY WALLS
118-47824-0051 FOR ONCE HE WAS GRATEFUL TO THE FOREST BECAUSE IT HAD FORBIDDEN HIM TO GLANCE PERPETUALLY BACK AT THAT DISMAL AND PENSIVE PICTURE THEN HE BECAME AWARE OF TWIGS HASTILY LOPPED OFF OF BUSHES BENT AND TORN OF THE UNCOVERING THROUGH THESE CARELESS MEANS OF AN OLD PATH
118-47824-0052 THE DULL THUD OF EARTH FALLING REGULARLY HE PAUSED LISTENING THE LABOUR OF THE MEN WAS GIVEN AN UNCOUTH RHYTHM BY THEIR GRUNTING EXPULSIONS OF BREATH OTHERWISE THE NATURE OF THEIR INDUSTRY AND ITS SURROUNDINGS HAD IMPOSED UPON THEM A SILENCE
118-47824-0053 IN ITSELF BEAST LIKE AND UNNATURAL AT LAST A HARSH VOICE CAME TO BOBBY ITS BREVITY POINTED THE PREVIOUS DUMBNESS OF THE SPEAKER DEEP ENOUGH AND BOBBY TURNED AND HURRIED BACK ALONG THE ROUGHLY RESTORED PATH
118-47824-0054 AS IF FLEEING FROM AN IMMATERIAL THING SUDDENLY QUICKENED WITH THE POWER OF ACCUSATION HE COULD PICTURE THE FRESH OBLONG EXCAVATION IN THE SOIL OF THE FAMILY BURIAL GROUND
118-47824-0055 THERE WAS AN IRONICAL JUSTICE IN THE CONDITION OF THE OLD CEMETERY IT HAD RECEIVED NO INTERMENT SINCE THE DEATH OF KATHERINE'S FATHER LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CEDARS SILAS BLACKBURN HAD DELIVERED IT TO THE SWIFT OBLITERATING FINGERS OF TIME
118-47824-0056 IF THE OLD MAN IN HIS SELFISHNESS HAD PAUSED TO GAZE BEYOND THE INEVITABLE FACT OF DEATH
118-47824-0057 HE WOULD HAVE GUARDED WITH A MORE PRECIOUS INTEREST THE DRAPINGS OF HIS FINAL SLEEP THIS NECESSARY TASK ON WHICH BOBBY HAD STUMBLED HAD MADE THE THICKET LESS CONGENIAL THAN THE HOUSE AS HE WALKED BACK HE FORECASTED WITH A KEEN APPREHENSION HIS APPROACHING ORDEAL
118-47824-0058 COULD HE WITNESS THE DEFINITE IMPRISONMENT OF HIS GRANDFATHER IN A NARROW BOX COULD HE WATCH THE COVERING EARTH FALL NOISILY IN THAT BLEAK PLACE OF SILENCE WITHOUT DISPLAYING FOR ROBINSON
118-47824-0059 A STRANGE MAN APPEARED WALKING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE HOUSE HIS BLACK CLOTHING RELIEVED ONLY BY NARROW EDGES OF WHITE CUFFS BETWEEN THE SLEEVES AND THE HEAVY MOURNING GLOVES FITTED WITH SOLEMN HARMONY INTO THE LANDSCAPE AND BOBBY'S MOOD
118-47824-0060 SUCH A FIGURE WAS APPROPRIATE TO THE CEDARS
118-47824-0061 HE EMERGED FROM THE FOREST AND SAW AGAIN THE LEISURELY WEAVING OF THE SMOKE SHROUD ABOVE THE HOUSE THEN HIS EYES WERE DRAWN BY THE RESTLESS MOVEMENTS OF A PAIR OF HORSES
118-47824-0062 NO LIKELY PATH YET WHOSE CROSSING IS THE PRICE OF SALVATION HE WAS GLAD TO SEE GRAHAM LEAVE THE COURT AND HURRY TOWARD HIM I WAS COMING TO HUNT YOU UP BOBBY THE MINISTER'S ARRIVED SO HAS DOCTOR GROOM EVERYTHING'S ABOUT READY DOCTOR GROOM
118-47824-0063 IT'S NATURAL ENOUGH HE SHOULD BE HERE BOBBY AGREED INDIFFERENTLY THEY WALKED SLOWLY BACK TO THE HOUSE GRAHAM MADE IT PLAIN THAT HIS MIND WAS FAR FROM THE SAD BUSINESS AHEAD

125-121342-0002 THE AIR BECAME GRAY AND OPALESCENT A SOLITARY LIGHT SUDDENLY OUTLINED A WINDOW OVER THE WAY THEN ANOTHER LIGHT THEN A HUNDRED MORE DANCED AND GLIMMERED INTO VISION UNDER HIS FEET A THICK IRON STUDDED SKYLIGHT TURNED YELLOW
125-121342-0003 IN THE STREET THE LAMPS OF THE TAXI CABS SENT OUT GLISTENING SHEENS ALONG THE ALREADY BLACK PAVEMENT THE UNWELCOME NOVEMBER RAIN HAD PERVERSELY STOLEN THE DAY'S LAST HOUR AND PAWNED IT WITH THAT ANCIENT FENCE THE NIGHT
125-121342-0004 THE SILENCE OF THE THEATRE BEHIND HIM ENDED WITH A CURIOUS SNAPPING SOUND FOLLOWED BY THE HEAVY ROARING OF A RISING CROWD AND THE INTERLACED CLATTER OF MANY VOICES THE MATINEE WAS OVER
125-121342-0005 HE STOOD ASIDE EDGED A LITTLE INTO THE RAIN TO LET THE THRONG PASS A SMALL BOY RUSHED OUT SNIFFED IN THE DAMP FRESH AIR AND TURNED UP THE COLLAR OF HIS COAT CAME THREE OR FOUR COUPLES IN A GREAT HURRY
125-121342-0006 CAME A FURTHER SCATTERING OF PEOPLE WHOSE EYES AS THEY EMERGED GLANCED INVARIABLY FIRST AT THE WET STREET THEN AT THE RAIN FILLED AIR FINALLY AT THE DISMAL SKY LAST A DENSE STROLLING MASS
125-121342-0007 THAT DEPRESSED HIM WITH ITS HEAVY ODOR COMPOUNDED OF THE TOBACCO SMELL OF THE MEN AND THE FETID SENSUOUSNESS OF STALE POWDER ON WOMEN AFTER THE THICK CROWD CAME ANOTHER SCATTERING A STRAY HALF DOZEN A MAN ON CRUTCHES
125-121342-0008 FINALLY THE RATTLING BANG OF FOLDING SEATS INSIDE ANNOUNCED THAT THE USHERS WERE AT WORK NEW YORK SEEMED NOT SO MUCH AWAKENING AS TURNING OVER IN ITS BED PALLID MEN RUSHED BY PINCHING TOGETHER THEIR COAT COLLARS
125-121342-0009 A GREAT SWARM OF TIRED MAGPIE GIRLS FROM A DEPARTMENT STORE CROWDED ALONG WITH SHRIEKS OF STRIDENT LAUGHTER THREE TO AN UMBRELLA A SQUAD OF MARCHING POLICEMEN PASSED ALREADY MIRACULOUSLY PROTECTED BY OILSKIN CAPES THE RAIN GAVE AMORY A FEELING OF DETACHMENT
125-121342-0010 AND THE NUMEROUS UNPLEASANT ASPECTS OF CITY LIFE WITHOUT MONEY OCCURRED TO HIM IN THREATENING PROCESSION THERE WAS THE GHASTLY STINKING CRUSH OF THE SUBWAY THE CAR CARDS THRUSTING THEMSELVES AT ONE LEERING OUT LIKE DULL BORES WHO GRAB YOUR ARM WITH ANOTHER STORY
125-121342-0011 THE QUERULOUS WORRY AS TO WHETHER SOME ONE ISN'T LEANING ON YOU A MAN DECIDING NOT TO GIVE HIS SEAT TO A WOMAN HATING HER FOR IT THE WOMAN HATING HIM FOR NOT DOING IT AT WORST A SQUALID PHANTASMAGORIA OF BREATH
125-121342-0012 AT BEST JUST PEOPLE TOO HOT OR TOO COLD TIRED WORRIED HE PICTURED THE ROOMS WHERE THESE PEOPLE LIVED WHERE THE PATTERNS OF THE BLISTERED WALL PAPERS WERE HEAVY REITERATED SUNFLOWERS ON GREEN AND YELLOW BACKGROUNDS
125-121342-0013 AND ALWAYS THERE WAS THE ECONOMICAL STUFFINESS OF INDOOR WINTER AND THE LONG SUMMERS NIGHTMARES OF PERSPIRATION BETWEEN STICKY ENVELOPING WALLS DIRTY RESTAURANTS WHERE CARELESS TIRED PEOPLE HELPED THEMSELVES TO SUGAR WITH THEIR OWN USED COFFEE SPOONS
125-121342-0014 LEAVING HARD BROWN DEPOSITS IN THE BOWL IT WAS NOT SO BAD WHERE THERE WERE ONLY MEN OR ELSE ONLY WOMEN IT WAS WHEN THEY WERE VILELY HERDED THAT IT ALL SEEMED SO ROTTEN IT WAS SOME SHAME THAT WOMEN GAVE OFF AT HAVING MEN SEE THEM TIRED AND POOR
125-121342-0015 IT WAS SOME DISGUST THAT MEN HAD FOR WOMEN WHO WERE TIRED AND POOR IT WAS DIRTIER THAN ANY BATTLE FIELD HE HAD SEEN
125-121342-0016 AND DANGER IT WAS AN ATMOSPHERE WHEREIN BIRTH AND MARRIAGE AND DEATH WERE LOATHSOME SECRET THINGS HE REMEMBERED ONE DAY IN THE SUBWAY WHEN A DELIVERY BOY HAD BROUGHT IN A GREAT FUNERAL WREATH OF FRESH FLOWERS
125-121342-0017 HOW THE SMELL OF IT HAD SUDDENLY CLEARED THE AIR AND GIVEN EVERY ONE IN THE CAR A MOMENTARY GLOW I DETEST POOR PEOPLE THOUGHT AMORY SUDDENLY I HATE THEM FOR BEING POOR POVERTY MAY HAVE BEEN BEAUTIFUL ONCE BUT IT'S ROTTEN NOW
125-121342-0018 AND SAYING SOMETHING TO HIS COMPANION WITH A LOOK OF UTTER DISGUST PROBABLY THOUGHT AMORY WHAT HE SAID WAS MY GOD AREN'T PEOPLE HORRIBLE NEVER BEFORE IN HIS LIFE HAD AMORY CONSIDERED POOR PEOPLE
125-121342-0019 HE THOUGHT CYNICALLY HOW COMPLETELY HE WAS LACKING IN ALL HUMAN SYMPATHY O HENRY HAD FOUND IN THESE PEOPLE ROMANCE PATHOS LOVE HATE AMORY SAW ONLY COARSENESS PHYSICAL FILTH AND STUPIDITY HE MADE NO SELF ACCUSATIONS
125-121342-0020 NEVER ANY MORE DID HE REPROACH HIMSELF FOR FEELINGS THAT WERE NATURAL AND SINCERE HE ACCEPTED ALL HIS REACTIONS AS A PART OF HIM UNCHANGEABLE UNMORAL THIS PROBLEM OF POVERTY TRANSFORMED MAGNIFIED ATTACHED TO SOME GRANDER
125-121342-0021 MORE DIGNIFIED ATTITUDE MIGHT SOME DAY EVEN BE HIS PROBLEM AT PRESENT IT ROUSED ONLY HIS PROFOUND DISTASTE HE WALKED OVER TO FIFTH AVENUE DODGING THE BLIND BLACK MENACE OF UMBRELLAS AND STANDING IN FRONT OF DELMONICO'S HAILED AN AUTO BUS

1334-135589-0049 ALTHOUGH NOT SAID IT IS EXPECTED THAT SHE IS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE TRANSFER AND I WILL ACCEPT NO WIFE ON SUCH CONDITIONS THAT IS TO SAY BECAUSE ALL YOU WISH FOR YOUR PROPERTY AND A WOMAN YOU LOVE ARE OFFERED YOU IN ONE LOT
1334-135589-0050 YOU WILL NOT ACCEPT THEM THEY MUST BE DIVIDED AND HANDED OVER TO YOU IN TWO SAID ALICE SMILING YOU MISTAKE DEAREST I AM NOT SO FOOLISH BUT I HAVE A CERTAIN PRIDE WHICH YOU CAN NOT BLAME ACCEPTING THE PROPERTY FROM MISTER HEATHERSTONE
1334-135589-0051 IS RECEIVING A FAVOR WERE IT GIVEN AS A MARRIAGE PORTION WITH HIS DAUGHTER NOW WHY SHOULD I ACCEPT AS A FAVOR WHAT I CAN CLAIM AS A RIGHT IT IS MY INTENTION OF APPEALING TO THE KING AND DEMANDING THE RESTORATION OF MY PROPERTY
1334-135589-0052 HE CAN NOT REFUSE IT PUT NOT YOUR TRUST IN PRINCES BROTHER REPLIED ALICE I DOUBT IF THE KING OR HIS COUNCIL WILL CONSIDER IT ADVISABLE TO MAKE SO MANY DISCONTENTED
1334-135589-0053 WHICH HAS BEEN SO LONG HELD BY OTHERS
1334-135589-0054 RECOLLECT ALSO THAT MISTER HEATHERSTONE AND HIS BROTHER IN LAW SIR ASHLEY COOPER HAVE DONE THE KING MUCH MORE SERVICE THAN YOU EVER HAVE OR CAN DO THEY HAVE BEEN MOST IMPORTANT AGENTS IN HIS RESTORATION
1334-135589-0055 AND THE KING'S OBLIGATIONS TO THEM ARE MUCH GREATER THAN THEY ARE TO YOU BESIDES MERELY FOR WHAT MAY BE CALLED A POINT OF HONOR FOR IT IS NO MORE IN WHAT AN UNPLEASANT SITUATION WILL YOU PUT HIS MAJESTY
1334-135589-0056 AT ALL EVENTS EDWARD RECOLLECT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT ARE THE INTENTIONS OF MISTER HEATHERSTONE WAIT AND SEE WHAT HE PROFFERS FIRST BUT MY DEAR SISTER IT APPEARS TO ME THAT HIS INTENTIONS ARE EVIDENT
1334-135589-0057 WHY HAS HE REBUILT ARNWOOD HE IS NOT GOING TO SURRENDER MY PROPERTY AND MAKE ME A PRESENT OF THE HOUSE
1334-135589-0058 YOU WERE AT THE WARS IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT YOU MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT RETURN HE SAID THIS TO HUMPHREY WHO HAS ALL ALONG BEEN ACTING AS HIS FACTOTUM IN THE BUSINESS AND RECOLLECT AT THE TIME THAT MISTER HEATHERSTONE COMMENCED THE REBUILDING OF THE MANSION
1334-135589-0059 WHAT PROSPECT WAS THERE OF THE RESTORATION OF THE KING OR OF YOUR EVER BEING IN A POSITION TO APPLY FOR THE RESTORATION OF YOUR PROPERTY I BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT HUMPHREY KNOWS MORE OF MISTER HEATHERSTONE'S INTENTIONS THAN HE HAS MADE KNOWN TO US
1334-135589-0060 AND I THEREFORE SAY AGAIN MY DEAR EDWARD MAKE NO APPLICATION TILL YOU ASCERTAIN WHAT MISTER HEATHERSTONE'S INTENTIONS MAY BE YOUR ADVICE IS GOOD MY DEAR ALICE AND I WILL BE GUIDED BY IT REPLIED EDWARD
1334-135589-0061 AND NOW LET ME GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE FOR YOUR FRIENDS MASTERS CHALONER AND GRENVILLE THAT MUCH OF THEIR PROPERTY HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY AND PUT INTO OTHER HANDS I KNOW AND PROBABLY THEY EXPECT IT WILL BE RESTORED UPON THEIR APPLICATION TO THE KING
1334-135589-0062 THOSE WHO HOLD THE PROPERTY THINK SO TOO AND SO FAR IT IS FORTUNATE NOW FROM WISER HEADS THAN MINE
1334-135589-0063 BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF THEY WERE TO MEET THE PARTIES AND CLOSE WITH THEM AT ONCE BEFORE THE KING'S INTENTIONS ARE KNOWN THEY WOULD RECOVER THEIR PROPERTY AT A THIRD OR A QUARTER OF THE VALUE NOW IS THEIR TIME
1334-135589-0064 EVEN A FEW DAYS DELAY MAY MAKE A DIFFERENCE THEY CAN EASILY OBTAIN A DELAY FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE MONEYS IMPRESS THAT UPON THEM MY DEAR EDWARD
1334-135589-0065 AND MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS THAT IS ADVICE WHICH MUST BE FOLLOWED REPLIED EDWARD WE MUST GO NOW AND I WILL NOT FAIL TO COMMUNICATE IT TO THEM THIS VERY NIGHT WE MAY AS WELL HERE INFORM THE READER
1334-135589-0066 THAT THE ADVICE WAS IMMEDIATELY ACTED UPON AND THAT CHALONER AND GRENVILLE RECOVERED ALL THEIR ESTATES AT ABOUT FIVE YEARS PURCHASE EDWARD REMAINED AT COURT SEVERAL DAYS HE HAD WRITTEN TO HUMPHREY AND HAD DISPATCHED A MESSENGER WITH THE LETTER
1334-135589-0067 BUT THE MESSENGER HAD NOT YET RETURNED
1334-135589-0068 ON THE FOLLOWING DAY A DRAWING ROOM WAS TO BE HELD AND EDWARD'S SISTERS WERE TO BE PRESENTED EDWARD WAS STANDING WITH MANY OTHERS OF THE SUIT BEHIND THE CHAIR OF THE KING AMUSING HIMSELF WITH THE PRESENTATIONS AS THEY TOOK PLACE
1334-135589-0069 AND WAITING FOR THE ARRIVAL OF HIS SISTERS CHALONER AND GRENVILLE WERE NOT WITH HIM THEY HAD OBTAINED LEAVE TO GO INTO THE COUNTRY FOR THE OBJECT WE HAVE BEFORE REFERRED TO WHEN HIS EYES CAUGHT ADVANCING TOWARD THE KING
1334-135589-0070 MISTER HEATHERSTONE WHO LED HIS DAUGHTER PATIENCE THAT THEY HAD NOT PERCEIVED HIM WAS EVIDENT INDEED HER EYES WERE NOT RAISED ONCE FROM THE NATURAL TIMIDITY FELT BY A YOUNG WOMAN IN THE PRESENCE OF ROYALTY
1334-135589-0071 EDWARD HALF CONCEALED HIMSELF BEHIND ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS THAT HE MIGHT GAZE UPON HER WITHOUT RESERVE
1334-135589-0072 BUT LITTLE ALTERED EXCEPT HAVING GROWN TALLER AND MORE ROUNDED AND PERFECT IN HER FIGURE AND HER COURT DRESS DISPLAYED PROPORTIONS WHICH HER HUMBLE COSTUME AT THE NEW FOREST HAD CONCEALED OR WHICH TIME HAD NOT MATURED
1334-135589-0073 THERE WAS THE SAME PENSIVE SWEET EXPRESSION IN HER FACE WHICH HAD ALTERED LITTLE BUT THE BEAUTIFUL ROUNDED ARMS
1334-135589-0074 AND THE PROPORTION OF THE WHOLE FIGURE WAS A SURPRISE TO HIM AND EDWARD IN HIS OWN MIND AGREED THAT SHE MIGHT WELL BE THE REIGNING TOAST OF THE DAY MISTER HEATHERSTONE ADVANCED AND MADE HIS OBEISANCE
1334-135589-0075 AND THEN HIS DAUGHTER WAS LED FORWARD AND INTRODUCED BY A LADY UNKNOWN TO EDWARD AFTER HE HAD SALUTED HER THE KING SAID LOUD ENOUGH FOR EDWARD TO HEAR
1334-135589-0076 I TRUST THAT THE DAUGHTER WILL OFTEN GRACE OUR COURT PATIENCE MADE NO REPLY BUT PASSED ON AND SOON AFTERWARD EDWARD LOST SIGHT OF HER IN THE CROWD
1334-135589-0077 AND TIME AND ABSENCE HAVE THEIR EFFECT UPON THE MOST ARDENT OF LOVERS THE SIGHT OF HER SO RESPLENDENT IN BEAUTY ACTED UPON HIM LIKE MAGIC AND HE WAS UNEASY TILL THE CEREMONY WAS OVER AND HE WAS ENABLED TO GO TO HIS SISTERS
1334-135589-0078 WHEN HE ENTERED THE ROOM HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE ARMS OF HUMPHREY WHO HAD ARRIVED WITH THE MESSENGER AFTER THE GREETINGS WERE OVER EDWARD SAID ALICE AND I HAVE SEEN PATIENCE AND I FEAR I MUST SURRENDER AT DISCRETION
1334-135589-0079 MISTER HEATHERSTONE MAY MAKE HIS OWN TERMS I MUST WAVE ALL PRIDE RATHER THAN LOSE HER I THOUGHT THAT I HAD MORE CONTROL OVER MYSELF BUT I HAVE SEEN HER AND FEEL THAT MY FUTURE HAPPINESS DEPENDS UPON OBTAINING HER AS A WIFE
1334-135589-0080 LET HER FATHER BUT GIVE ME HER AND ARNWOOD WILL BE BUT A TRIFLE IN ADDITION WITH RESPECT TO THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH YOU ARE TO POSSESS ARNWOOD SAID HUMPHREY I CAN INFORM YOU WHAT THEY ARE
1334-135589-0081 THEY ARE WHOLLY UNSHACKLED FURTHER THAN THAT YOU ARE TO REPAY BY INSTALLMENTS THE MONEY EXPENDED IN THE BUILDING OF THE HOUSE THIS I AM EMPOWERED TO STATE TO YOU AND I THINK YOU WILL ALLOW THAT MISTER HEATHERSTONE
1334-135589-0082 HAS FULLY ACTED UP TO WHAT HE STATED WERE HIS VIEWS WHEN HE FIRST OBTAINED A GRANT OF THE PROPERTY HE HAS INDEED REPLIED EDWARD AS FOR HIS DAUGHTER EDWARD YOU HAVE YET TO WIN HER AND WEAR HER
1334-135589-0083 AS THE SAYING IS HER FATHER WILL RESIGN THE PROPERTY TO YOU AS YOURS BY RIGHT BUT YOU HAVE NO PROPERTY IN HIS DAUGHTER AND I SUSPECT THAT SHE WILL NOT BE QUITE SO EASILY HANDED OVER TO YOU
1334-135589-0084 BUT WHY SHOULD YOU SAY SO HUMPHREY HAVE WE NOT BEEN ATTACHED FROM OUR YOUTH YES IT WAS A YOUTHFUL PASSION I GRANT BUT RECOLLECT NOTHING CAME OF IT AND YEARS HAVE PASSED AWAY
1334-135589-0085 IT IS NOW SEVEN YEARS SINCE YOU QUITTED THE FOREST AND IN YOUR LETTERS TO MISTER HEATHERSTONE YOU MADE NO REMARK UPON WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN YOU AND PATIENCE SINCE THAT YOU HAVE NEVER CORRESPONDED OR SENT ANY MESSAGES
1334-135589-0086 AND YOU CAN HARDLY EXPECT THAT A GIRL FROM THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR WILL CHERISH THE IMAGE OF ONE WHO TO SAY THE LEAST HAD TREATED HER WITH INDIFFERENCE THAT IS MY VIEW OF THE MATTER EDWARD IT MAY BE WRONG
1334-135589-0087 AND IT MAY BE TRUE REPLIED EDWARD MOURNFULLY WELL
1334-135589-0088 YOU KNOW HUMPHREY HOW MANY OFFERS PATIENCE HEATHERSTONE HAS HAD AND HAS EVERY DAY I MAY SAY
1334-135589-0089 TO A PROUD BROTHER OF MINE WHO DOES NOT DESERVE HER IT MAY BE SO EDITH REPLIED HUMPHREY WOMEN ARE RIDDLES I ONLY ARGUED UPON THE COMMON SENSE OF THE THING MUCH YOU KNOW ABOUT WOMEN
1334-135589-0090 REPLIED EDITH TO BE SURE YOU DO NOT MEET MANY IN THE NEW FOREST WHERE YOU HAVE LIVED ALL YOUR LIFE VERY TRUE MY DEAR SISTER PERHAPS THAT IS THE REASON THAT THE NEW FOREST HAS HAD SUCH CHARMS FOR ME
1334-135589-0091 AFTER THAT SPEECH SIR THE SOONER YOU GET BACK AGAIN THE BETTER RETORTED EDITH BUT EDWARD MADE A SIGN TO HUMPHREY AND THEY BEAT A RETREAT HAVE YOU SEEN THE INTENDANT HUMPHREY NO
1334-135589-0092 I WAS ABOUT TO CALL UPON HIM BUT I WANTED TO SEE YOU FIRST I WILL GO WITH YOU I HAVE NOT DONE HIM JUSTICE REPLIED EDWARD AND YET I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN TO HIM SAY NOTHING BUT MEET HIM CORDIALLY
1334-135589-0093 THAT WILL BE EXPLANATION SUFFICIENT I SHALL MEET HIM AS ONE WHOM I SHALL ALWAYS REVERE
1334-135589-0094 WHAT MUST HE THINK OF MY NOT HAVING CALLED UPON HIM NOTHING YOU HOLD A PLACE AT COURT YOU MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN THAT HE WAS IN LONDON AS YOU HAVE NEVER MET HIM YOUR COMING WITH ME WILL MAKE IT APPEAR SO
1334-135589-0095 TELL HIM THAT I HAVE JUST MADE KNOWN TO YOU HIS NOBLE AND DISINTERESTED CONDUCT YOU ARE RIGHT I WILL I FEAR HOWEVER HUMPHREY THAT YOU ARE RIGHT AND EDITH WRONG AS REGARDS HIS DAUGHTER
1334-135589-0096 NAY EDWARD RECOLLECT THAT I HAVE AS EDITH OBSERVED PASSED MY LIFE IN THE WOODS EDWARD WAS MOST KINDLY RECEIVED BY MISTER HEATHERSTONE EDWARD
1334-135589-0097 ON MISTER HEATHERSTONE REPEATING TO HIM HIS INTENTIONS RELATIVE TO ARNWOOD EXPRESSED HIS SENSE OF THAT GENTLEMAN'S CONDUCT SIMPLY ADDING YOU MAY THINK ME IMPETUOUS SIR BUT I TRUST YOU WILL BELIEVE ME GRATEFUL
1334-135589-0098 PATIENCE COLORED UP AND TREMBLED WHEN EDWARD FIRST SAW HER EDWARD DID NOT REFER TO THE PAST FOR SOME TIME AFTER THEY HAD RENEWED THEIR ACQUAINTANCE HE WOOED HER AGAIN AND WON HER
1334-135589-0099 THEN ALL WAS EXPLAINED ABOUT A YEAR AFTER THE RESTORATION THERE WAS A FETE AT HAMPTON COURT GIVEN IN HONOR OF THREE MARRIAGES TAKING PLACE EDWARD BEVERLEY TO PATIENCE HEATHERSTONE CHALONER
1334-135589-0100 TO ALICE AND GRENVILLE TO EDITH AND AS HIS MAJESTY HIMSELF SAID AS HE GAVE AWAY THE BRIDES COULD LOYALTY BE BETTER REWARDED BUT OUR YOUNG READERS WILL NOT BE CONTENT IF THEY DO NOT HEAR
1334-135589-0101 SOME PARTICULARS ABOUT THE OTHER PERSONAGES WHO HAVE APPEARED IN OUR LITTLE HISTORY HUMPHREY MUST TAKE THE FIRST PLACE HIS LOVE OF FARMING CONTINUED EDWARD GAVE HIM A LARGE FARM RENT FREE
1334-135589-0102 AND IN A FEW YEARS HUMPHREY SAVED UP SUFFICIENT TO PURCHASE A PROPERTY FOR HIMSELF HE THEN MARRIED CLARA RATCLIFFE WHO HAS NOT APPEARED LATELY ON THE SCENE OWING TO HER HAVING BEEN ABOUT TWO YEARS BEFORE THE RESTORATION
1334-135589-0103 CLAIMED BY AN ELDERLY RELATION WHO LIVED IN THE COUNTRY AND WHOSE INFIRM STATE OF HEALTH DID NOT PERMIT HIM TO QUIT THE HOUSE HE LEFT HIS PROPERTY TO CLARA ABOUT A YEAR AFTER HER MARRIAGE TO HUMPHREY
1334-135589-0104 THE COTTAGE IN THE NEW FOREST WAS HELD BY AND EVENTUALLY MADE OVER TO PABLO WHO BECAME A VERY STEADY CHARACTER AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME MARRIED A YOUNG GIRL FROM ARNWOOD AND HAD A HOUSEFUL OF YOUNG GIPSIES
1334-135589-0105 OSWALD SO SOON AS EDWARD CAME DOWN TO ARNWOOD GAVE UP HIS PLACE IN THE NEW FOREST AND LIVED ENTIRELY WITH EDWARD AS HIS STEWARD AND PHOEBE ALSO WENT TO ARNWOOD AND LIVED TO A GOOD OLD AGE
1334-135589-0106 IN THE CAPACITY OF HOUSEKEEPER HER TEMPER BECOMING RATHER WORSE THAN BETTER AS SHE ADVANCED IN YEARS THIS IS ALL THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COLLECT RELATIVE TO THE SEVERAL PARTIES
1355-39947-0000 PSYCHOTHERAPY AND THE COMMUNITY BOTH THE PHYSICIAN AND THE PATIENT FIND THEIR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY THE LIFE INTERESTS OF WHICH ARE SUPERIOR TO THE INTERESTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL
1355-39947-0001 IT IS AN UNAVOIDABLE QUESTION HOW FAR FROM THE HIGHER POINT OF VIEW OF THE SOCIAL MIND THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC EFFORTS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED OR SUPPRESSED ARE THERE ANY CONDITIONS WHICH SUGGEST SUSPICION OF OR DIRECT OPPOSITION TO SUCH CURATIVE WORK
1355-39947-0002 OF COURSE SOCIETY HAS TO BE SURE THAT NO POSSIBLE MISUSE AND DAMAGE ARE TO RESULT FROM SUCH PRACTICE FEARS IN THAT DIRECTION HAVE BEEN UTTERED REPEATEDLY BUT FROM VERY DIFFERENT STANDPOINTS
1355-39947-0003 ONE WHICH IS PERHAPS MOST OFTEN HEARD IN POPULAR CIRCLES RESULTS FROM AN ENTIRE MISUNDERSTANDING AND DESERVES HARDLY ANY DISCUSSION AFTER OUR DETAILED STUDY OF THE PROCESSES INVOLVED IT IS CLAIMED THAT SUGGESTIVE POWER ESPECIALLY IN THE FORM OF
1355-39947-0004 HYPNOTIZATION MAY BE SECRETLY MISUSED TO MAKE ANYONE WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE AND AGAINST HIS WILL A PASSIVE INSTRUMENT OF THE HYPNOTIST'S INTENT OFTEN THIS IS COUPLED WITH TELEPATHIC FANCIES
1355-39947-0005 THE HYPNOTIST IS BELIEVED TO HAVE MYSTIC POWER TO BRING ANY PERSON IN A DISTANT REGION UNDER HIS MENTAL CONTROL AND THUS TO BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT ANY SINISTER PLANS BY THE HELP OF HIS INNOCENT VICTIM ALL HYPNOTIZING THEREFORE OUGHT TO BE INTERDICTED BY THE STATE
1355-39947-0006 THE PRESUPPOSITIONS OF SUCH A VIEW ARE AS WE KNOW NOW ENTIRELY ABSURD WE KNOW THAT HYPNOTISM IS NOT BASED ON ANY SPECIAL POWER OF THE HYPNOTIZER THERE IS NO MAGNETIC FLUID IN THE SENSE OF THE OLD MESMERISM
1355-39947-0007 THE IMAGINATION OF THE HYPNOTIZED PERSON IS THE ONLY HYPNOTIZING AGENCY THUS NO ONE CAN BE HYPNOTIZED WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE OR AGAINST HIS WILL THE STORY OF TELEPATHIC MYSTERIES WHICH IS OFTEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE PUBLIC
1355-39947-0008 IS PROBABLY ALWAYS THE OUTCOME OF A DISEASED BRAIN IT IS INDEED A FREQUENT SYMPTOM IN PARANOIA AND OTHER INSANITIES THAT THE PATIENT WHO FEELS ABNORMAL ORGANIC SENSATIONS AND ABNORMAL UNACCOUNTABLE IMPULSES INTERPRETS THEM AS INFLUENCES OF A DISTANT ENEMY
1355-39947-0009 WHOLE PAMPHLETS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN WITH ELABORATION OF SUCH INSANE MISINTERPRETATIONS AND REQUESTS TO LEGISLATURES HAVE BEEN MADE IN THAT SPIRIT BUT THE PHYSICIAN RECOGNIZES EASILY THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE ARGUMENTATION THE WELL KNOWN PHENOMENA OF THE MENTAL DISEASE
1355-39947-0010 TO BE SURE WHILE NO ONE CAN BE HYPNOTIZED AGAINST HIS WILL MANY A PERSON IS LIABLE TO ACCEPT SUGGESTIONS FROM OTHERS AND THUS TO CARRY OUT THE WISHES OF OTHERS ALMOST WITHOUT KNOWING AND CERTAINLY WITHOUT WILLING THAT THE OTHER MIND INTERFERE WITH THE INTERPLAY OF THE OWN MOTIVES
1355-39947-0011 BUT IF WE WERE TO STRIKE OUT ALL SUGGESTIVE INFLUENCES FROM SOCIAL LIFE WE SHOULD GIVE UP SOCIAL LIFE ITSELF SUGGESTION IS GIVEN WHEREVER MEN COME IN CONTACT IN ITSELF IT IS NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD THE GOOD RESOLUTION AND THE BAD ONE CAN BE SUGGESTED
1355-39947-0012 THE GOOD EXAMPLE AND THE BAD CAN BE EFFECTIVE BOTH ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE NOBLE AND IMITATION OF THE EVIL MAY WORK WITH THE SAME MENTAL TECHNIQUE CERTAINLY THERE ARE SOME PERSONS WHO HAVE A STRONGER INFLUENCE THAN OTHERS ON THE IMAGINATION OF THOSE WITH WHOM THEY COME IN CONTACT
1355-39947-0013 THEIR EXPRESSION AWAKENS CONFIDENCE THEIR VOICE AND THEIR WORDS REACH DEEPER LAYERS OF THE MIND THEIR CALMNESS AND FIRMNESS OVERWHELM MORE EASILY THE ANTAGONISTIC IDEAS
1355-39947-0014 BUT THE CHIEF DIFFERENCE LIES AFTER ALL IN THE DIFFERENT DEGREES OF SUGGESTIBILITY AMONG THOSE WHO RECEIVE SUCH IMPRESSIONS THE EASILY SUGGESTIBLE PERSON CANNOT BE PROTECTED BY ANY INTERDICT HE MAY CATCH SUGGESTIONS EVERYWHERE
1355-39947-0015 ANY ADVERTISEMENT IN THE NEWSPAPER AND ANY DISPLAY IN THE SHOP WINDOW MAY OVERRUN HIS OWN INTENTIONS WHAT HE NEEDS IS TRAINING IN FIRMNESS THE APPLICATION OF REENFORCED SUGGESTION OR EVEN OF HYPNOTISM IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE IS EVEN FOR HIM
1355-39947-0016 NO POSSIBLE SOURCE OF DANGER ON A HIGHER LEVEL ARE OBJECTIONS WHICH COME FROM SERIOUS QUARTERS AND WHICH ARE NOT WITHOUT SYMPATHY WITH TRUE SCIENCE IN RECENT TIMES THIS OPPOSITION HAS REPEATEDLY FOUND ELOQUENT EXPRESSION IT IS AN OBJECTION FROM THE STANDPOINT OF MORALITY
1355-39947-0017 BELONGING THEREFORE ENTIRELY TO THE PURPOSIVE VIEW OF THE MIND BUT WE HAVE NOW REACHED A POINT WHERE IT IS OUR DUTY TO DO JUSTICE TO THIS PURPOSIVE VIEW TOO AS LONG AS WE DISCUSSED THE PROBLEM ENTIRELY FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE PHYSICIAN
1355-39947-0018 NO OTHER VIEW OF MENTAL LIFE EXCEPT THE CAUSAL ONE COULD BE IN QUESTION AS SOON AS WE LOOK AT IT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE COMMUNITY IT BECOMES OUR DUTY TO BRING THE CAUSAL AND THE PURPOSIVE VIEW INTO HARMONY AND IT WOULD BE NARROW AND SHORT SIGHTED SIMPLY TO
1355-39947-0019 DRAW THE PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES OF A NATURALISTIC VIEW OF THE MIND WITHOUT INQUIRING WHETHER OR NOT SERIOUS INTERESTS IN THE PURPOSIVE SPHERE ARE INJURED IF THERE IS MORAL CRITICISM AGAINST SUGGESTIVE THERAPY IT IS THE DUTY OF THE COMMUNITY TO CONSIDER IT
1355-39947-0020 THIS OPPOSITION ARGUES AS FOLLOWS HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE BRINGS THE PATIENT UNDER THE WILL CONTROL OF THE HYPNOTIZER AND THUS DESTROYS HIS OWN FREEDOM WHATEVER THE PATIENT MAY REACH IN THE ALTERED STATES IS REACHED WITHOUT HIS OWN EFFORT WHILE HE IS THE PASSIVE RECEIVER
1355-39947-0021 HIS ACHIEVEMENT HAS THEREFORE NO MORAL VALUE AND IF HE IS REALLY CURED OF HIS DRUNKENNESS OR OF HIS PERVERSE HABITS OF HIS MISUSE OF COCAINE OR OF HIS CRIMINAL TENDENCIES HE HAS LOST THE RIGHT TO BE COUNTED A MORAL AGENT IT WOULD BE BETTER
1355-39947-0022 IF THERE WERE MORE SUFFERING IN THE WORLD THAN THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE MORAL WILL SHOULD BE UNDERMINED NO ONE OUGHT TO TAKE SUCH ARGUMENTS LIGHTLY THE SPIRIT WHICH DIRECTS THEM IS NEEDED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN OUR TIME OF REACHING OUT FOR SUPERFICIAL GOODS
1355-39947-0023 NO ONE CAN INSIST TOO EARNESTLY THAT LIFE IS WORTH LIVING ONLY IF IT SERVES MORAL DUTIES AND MORAL FREEDOM AND IS NOT DETERMINED BY PLEASURES AND ABSENCE OF PAIN ONLY THOSE WHO SET FORTH THIS ARGUMENT ARE ENTIRELY WILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE
1355-39947-0024 PROFOUND EFFECT WHICH SUGGESTIVE THERAPEUTICS MAY CREATE MORE THAN THIS THEY HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT TO GAIN A BASIS FOR THEIR ATTACK JUST BECAUSE THE HYPNOTIZER CAN ENTIRELY CHANGE THE DESIRES AND PASSIONS THE HABITS AND PERVERSITIES OF THE SUFFERING VICTIM
1355-39947-0025 HE SEEMS TO THEM A MORAL WRONGDOER WHO NEGATES THE PRINCIPLE OF HUMAN FREEDOM A FORCIBLE BOOK OF RECENT DAYS CALLS THE SUGGESTIVE POWER OF THE PSYCHOTHERAPIST THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME IT SAYS TO THE HYPNOTIST
1355-39947-0026 BY YOUR OWN TESTIMONY YOU STAND CONVICTED OF APPLYING A PROCESS WHICH DEPRIVES YOUR SUBJECTS OF THE INALIENABLE RIGHT AND POWER OF INDIVIDUAL SELF CONTROL IN PROPORTION AS YOU DEPRIVE HIM OF THE POWER OF SELF CONTROL
1355-39947-0027 YOU DEPRIVE HIM OF THAT UPON WHICH HIS INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY AND MORAL STATUS DEPEND IN PROPORTION AS YOU DEPRIVE HIM OF THE FREE CONTROL AND EXERCISE OF THOSE POWERS OF THE SOUL UPON WHICH HIS INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY AND MORAL STATUS DEPEND
1355-39947-0028 YOU THEREBY ROB HIM OF THOSE POWERS UPON WHICH HE MUST DEPEND FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL IMMORTALITY BUT THIS CENSURE TOO IS ENTIRELY MISTAKEN NOT BECAUSE IT URGES THE PURPOSIVE VIEWS AGAINST THE CAUSAL
1355-39947-0029 BUT BECAUSE IT IS IN ERROR AS TO THE FACTS SUCH CRITICS ARE FULLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE STARTLING RESULTS WHICH ARE REACHED THEY DO NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE TO EXAMINE THE LONG AND DIFFICULT WAY WHICH HAS HAD TO BE TRAVERSED WITH PATIENCE AND ENERGY
1355-39947-0030 IT IS QUITE TRUE THAT IF I HYPNOTIZE A MAN AND SUGGEST TO HIM TO TAKE UP AFTER AWAKING THE BOOK WHICH LIES ON MY TABLE HE FOLLOWS MY SUGGESTION WITHOUT CONFLICT AND IN A CERTAIN SENSE WITHOUT FREEDOM HE FEELS A SIMPLE IMPULSE TO GO TO THE TABLE AND LIFT THE BOOK AND
1355-39947-0031 AS NO STRONGER NATURAL DESIRE AND NO MORAL OBJECTION STAND IN THE WAY HE CARRIES OUT THAT MEANINGLESS IMPULSE AND PERHAPS EVEN INVENTS A FOOLISH MOTIVE TO EXPLAIN TO HIMSELF WHY HE WANTED TO LOOK AT THAT BOOK
1355-39947-0032 BUT AFTER A LONG EXPERIENCE I HAVE MY DOUBTS AS TO WHETHER A MAN WAS EVER CURED IN SUCH A WAY BY HYPNOTISM OF SERIOUS DISTURBANCES AND OF THOSE ANOMALOUS ACTIONS WHICH THE CRITICS WANT TO SEE OVERCOME BY THE PATIENT'S OWN MORAL EFFORTS ON THE CONTRARY
1355-39947-0033 EVERY SUGGESTION HAS TO RELY ON THE EFFORTS AND STRUGGLES OF THE PATIENT HIMSELF AND ALL THAT THE PSYCHOTHERAPISTS CAN GIVE HIM IS HELP IN HIS OWN MORAL FIGHT HIS OWN WILL IS PRESUPPOSITION FOR BEING HYPNOTIZED
1355-39947-0034 IF AGAIN AND AGAIN I HESITATE TO UNDERTAKE NEW CASES IT IS JUST BECAUSE I HAVE TO SEE DURING THE TREATMENT TOO MUCH OF THIS DAILY AND HOURLY STRIVING AGAINST OVERPOWERING IMPULSES THE JOY OF REMOVING SOME OBSTACLES FROM THE WAY OF THE PATIENTS
1355-39947-0035 IS TOO MUCH OVERSHADOWED BY THE DEEP PITY AND SYMPATHY WITH THEIR SUFFERING AND CRAVING DURING THE WHOLE PERIOD OF SUCCESSIVE TREATMENTS TO MAKE A MAN FIGHT WHERE DESPAIR IS INEVITABLE AND WHERE THE ENEMY IS NECESSARILY STRONGER THAN HIS OWN POWERS CAN CERTAINLY NOT BE THE MORAL DEMAND
1355-39947-0036 MORALITY POSTULATES THAT EVERYONE FIND CONDITIONS IN WHICH HE CAN BE VICTORIOUS IF HE PUTS HIS STRONGEST EFFORTS TO THE TASK IN OUR DISCUSSION OF THE MENTAL SYMPTOMS I REPORTED AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE SUGGESTIVE TREATMENT OF THE DRUG PASSION
1355-39947-0037 THE CASE OF A MORPHINIST TO MAKE CLEAR THIS PURPOSIVE SIDE OF THE CASE AS AGAINST THE CAUSAL ONE WHICH ALONE INTERESTED THE PHYSICIAN I MAY ADD A FEW FEATURES TO THE SHORT REPORT AS A TYPICAL EXAMPLE
1355-39947-0038 WHEN THAT MAN LEFT MY LABORATORY FOR THE LAST TIME TO GO OUT TO WORK AND HAPPINESS YOU MIGHT WELL HAVE BELIEVED FROM HIS JOYFUL FACE THAT IT HAD BEEN AN EASY AND PLEASANT TIME IN WHICH HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE SMOOTHLY REMOVED FROM HIM THE DANGEROUS DESIRE FOR MORPHINE
1355-39947-0039 IN TRUTH IT WAS THE RESULT OF FOUR MONTHS OF THE MOST NOBLE AND COURAGEOUS SUFFERING AND STRUGGLING HE HAD BEEN FOR YEARS A SLAVE TO HIS PASSION TO QUOTE FROM HIS LITTLE AUTOBIOGRAPHY WHEN I REALIZED THAT I WAS ADDICTED TO MORPHINE
1355-39947-0040 THAT IS COMING TO ANYONE WHO IS THE USER OF OPIUM OR ANY OF ITS ALKALOIDS FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS I FOUND GREAT RELIEF AFTER EVERY INJECTION OF MORPHINE BUT SOON I COULD NOT GET THE SAME EASY FEELING AND COULD EAT BUT VERY LITTLE AND WHAT SLEEP I GOT WAS IN THE DAYTIME
1355-39947-0041 I FINALLY WENT TO THE SANITARIUM OF A DOCTOR
1355-39947-0042 WHEN I FIRST WENT TO SEE THE PROFESSOR IN THE HARVARD PSYCHOLOGICAL LABORATORY I WAS USING BETWEEN THIRTY TWO AND THIRTY EIGHT GRAINS OF MORPHINE DAILY HE PUT ME UNDER HIS TREATMENT OCTOBER SIXTH AND THAT DAY CUT ME DOWN BY HYPNOTIC TREATMENT TO NINE GRAINS A DAY OR
1355-39947-0043 THREE DOSES OF THREE GRAINS A DAY I TOOK MY HYPODERMIC AS DIRECTED BUT ON THE FOLLOWING DAY I LAY ON THE BED TOO EXHAUSTED TO GET UP EVEN TO GET AROUND THE ROOM AND I COULD NOT EAT
1355-39947-0044 THE DESIRE FOR THE DRUG WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE BUT IN ABOUT FOUR DAYS I GOT USED TO THE LOSS OF SO MUCH MORPHINE AND STAYED ON THIS AMOUNT FOR A WEEK SEEING THE PROFESSOR EVERY OTHER DAY FOR HYPNOTIC TREATMENT AND THEN RETURNING TO MY ROOM WHERE I SPENT TWENTY TWO HOURS OF THE TWENTY FOUR ON THE BED
1355-39947-0045 BUT DID NOT SLEEP MORE THAN TWO OR THREE HOURS A DAY
1355-39947-0046 I WAS CUT OFF BY HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION HALF A GRAIN AND THIS PUT ME TO FIGHTING THE DESIRE AGAIN
1355-39947-0047 THESE REDUCTIONS OF THE DOSE WERE MADE A WEEK APART AND SOMETIMES ONLY TWO DAYS THE WORST TIME OF ALL WAS A CUT FROM FOUR INJECTIONS OF A FOURTH OF A GRAIN EACH TO FOUR OF ONE EIGHTH OF A GRAIN EACH WHICH WAS ABOUT JANUARY TENTH
1355-39947-0048 AT THIS TIME I HAD THE WORST TWO DAYS OF MY LIFE I TRIED WHISKEY BUT IT GAVE RELIEF ONLY FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AND THEN THE DESIRE WAS WORSE THAN EVER
1355-39947-0049 HE WAS THUS AT EVERY MOMENT DURING THE DAY AND NIGHT IN FULL POSSESSION OF THE DEADLY POISON WITH WHICH HE COULD HAVE FULLY SATISFIED HIS CRAVING IT WAS A MORAL VICTORY WHEN HE FINALLY REACHED THE POINT AT WHICH HE WENT FOR SEVERAL WEEKS WITHOUT ANY DESIRE FOR MORPHINE
1355-39947-0050 AND FINALLY PRESENTED THE REMAINING TABLETS TO A HOSPITAL AND YET THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE LEAST CHANCE FOR HIS WINNING THIS ETHICAL VICTORY WITHOUT THE OUTER HELP OF THE HYPNOTIST WE DO NOT ELIMINATE THE MORAL WILL BUT WE REMOVE SOME UNFAIR OBSTACLES FROM ITS PATH
1355-39947-0051 WE HAVE NO MYSTIC POWER BY WHICH OUR WILL SIMPLY TAKES HOLD OF THE OTHER MAN'S WILL BUT WE INHIBIT AND SUPPRESS BY INFLUENCE ON THE IMAGINATION THOSE ABNORMAL IMPULSES WHICH RESIST THE SOUND DESIRES IF THAT WERE IMMORAL
1355-39947-0052 WE SHOULD HAVE TO MAKE UP OUR MINDS THAT ALL EDUCATION AND TRAINING WERE PERVERTED WITH SUCH IMMORAL ELEMENTS EVERY SOUND RESPECT FOR AUTHORITY WHICH MAKES A CHILD WILLING TO ACCEPT THE ADVICE AND MAXIMS OF HIS ELDERS IS JUST SUCH AN INFLUENCE
1355-39947-0053 IF IT WERE REALLY A MORAL DEMAND THAT THE WILL BE LEFT TO ITS OWN RESOURCES AND THAT NO OUTSIDE INFLUENCE COME TO STRENGTHEN ITS POWER OR REMOVE ITS HINDRANCES OR SMOOTH ITS PATH THEN WE OUGHT TO LET THE CHILDREN GROW UP AS NATURE CREATED THEM
1355-39947-0054 AND OUGHT NOT TO TRY TO SUPPRESS FROM WITHOUT BY DISCIPLINE AND TRAINING BY LOVE AND ENCOURAGEMENT THE WILLFUL IMPULSES AND THE UGLY HABITS EVEN EVERY GOOD MODEL FOR IMITATION IS SUCH A SUGGESTIVE INFLUENCE FROM WITHOUT AND EVERY SOLEMN APPEAL TO LOYALTY AND FRIENDSHIP
1355-39947-0055 TO PATRIOTISM AND RELIGION INCREASES THE DEGREE OF SUGGESTIBILITY THAT IS THE GLORY OF LIFE THAT THE SUGGESTIVE POWER MAY BELONG TO MORAL VALUES INSTEAD OF MERE PLEASURES BUT IT IS NOT THE AIM OF LIFE TO REMAIN UNTOUCHED BY SUGGESTION
1355-39947-0056 AND HE WHO BY SUGGESTION HELPS THE WEAK MIND TO OVERCOME OBSTACLES WHICH THE STRONG MIND CAN OVERTHROW FROM ITS INBORN RESOURCES WORKS FOR THE GOOD OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND OF THE COMMUNITY IN THE SPIRIT OF TRUEST MORALITY MUCH MORE JUSTIFIED THAN SUCH
1355-39947-0057 ETHICAL OBJECTIONS ARE THE FEARS WHICH MOVE ENTIRELY IN THE CAUSAL SPHERE IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT A METHOD WHICH HAS SUCH POWERFUL INFLUENCE OVER THE MIND THAT IT CAN SECURE IDEAS AND EMOTIONS AND IMPULSES WHICH THE OWN WILL OF THE PATIENT CANNOT PRODUCE
1355-39947-0058 OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED ONLY TO THOSE WHO ARE PREPARED FOR ITS SKILLFUL USE TO HYPNOTIZE OR TO PERFORM ANY PERSISTENT PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC TREATMENT MAY THUS BE DANGEROUS IF IT IS DONE BY THE UNFIT
1355-39947-0059 WE HAVE DISCUSSED BEFORE THE INJURIES WHICH MIGHT RESULT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION OF SUCH POWERFUL PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC EFFECTS THROUGH THE BEST MEANING MINISTER BUT WE CAN EXTEND THIS FEAR TO ANYONE WHO HAS NOT SYSTEMATICALLY STUDIED MEDICINE AND TO A CERTAIN DEGREE NORMAL AND ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY
1355-39947-0060 THE POSSIBILITIES OF OVERLOOKING SYMPTOMS WHICH OUGHT TO SUGGEST AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT TREATMENT OR OF ADJUSTING THE TREATMENT BADLY TO THE SPECIAL PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OR OF IGNORING THE DESIRABLE PHYSICAL SUPPLEMENT BY DRUGS OR OF CREATING UNINTENTIONALLY BY SUGGESTION
1355-39947-0061 INJURIOUS EFFECTS ARE ALWAYS OPEN WHEN MEDICAL AMATEURS UNDERTAKE SUCH WORK CERTAINLY THERE IS NO PHYSICIAN WHO IS NOT LIABLE TO MAKE MISTAKES AND A PHYSICIAN WHO HAS NEVER GIVEN ANY ATTENTION TO PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY
1355-39947-0062 WOULD ALSO BE A RATHER POOR AGENT OF PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC METHODS BUT THE PROBABILITY IS THAT SUCH A PHYSICIAN WOULD SIMPLY ABSTAIN BY PRINCIPLE FROM ALL PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC METHODS HIS MISTAKE ONLY BEGINS IF FROM HIS LACK OF ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE SUBJECT
1355-39947-0063 HE DRAWS THE CONCLUSION THAT THE METHOD ITSELF IS UNDESIRABLE THAT HIS REAL PREPARATION OUGHT TO INCLUDE PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES WE HAVE POINTED OUT BEFORE AND THE TIME SEEMS RIPE FOR THE COMMUNITY TO URGE SUCH A REFORM OF THE STUDIES
1355-39947-0064 ALL THAT INVOLVES THE CONVICTION THAT EVEN THE EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGIST AS SUCH IS NOT PREPARED TO ENTER INTO MEDICAL TREATMENT AND A PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC MANAGED BY A PSYCHOLOGIST WHO IS NOT A DOCTOR OF MEDICINE
1355-39947-0065 IS CERTAINLY NOT BETTER THAN A CHURCH CLINIC I CANNOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE RIGHT OF PSYCHOLOGISTS TO MAKE HYPNOTIC EXPERIMENTS MERELY FOR THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT'S SAKE NOBODY OUGHT TO BE BROUGHT INTO A HYPNOTIC OR OTHERWISE ABNORMAL STATE OF MIND
1355-39947-0066 IF IT IS NOT SUGGESTED BY THE INTERESTS OF THE SUBJECT HIMSELF SCIENCE HAS THE RIGHT TO MAKE HYPNOTIC EXPERIMENTS OR EXPERIMENTS WITH ABNORMAL MENTAL STATES ONLY UNDER THE ONE CONDITION THAT A PHYSICIAN HAS HYPNOTIZED THE SUBJECT IN THE INTERESTS OF HIS HEALTH
1355-39947-0067 AND THAT THE PATIENT HAS AGREED BEFOREHAND TO ALLOW IN THE PRESENCE OF WITNESSES CERTAIN PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT ANY HYPNOTIZATION FOR MERE AMUSEMENT AND AS A PARLOR TRICK OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED AS
1355-39947-0068 CRIMINAL ON SOME OTHER OBJECTIONS WHICH INTEREST THE COMMUNITY AS SUCH WE HAD TO TOUCH BEFORE AND THERE IS NO NEED OF RETURNING TO THEM WITH ANY FULLNESS OF ARGUMENT WE SPOKE OF THE DANGER WHICH THE MENTAL CURES CARRY WITH THEM WHEN THEY ARE BASED ON ANY PARTICULAR CREED
1355-39947-0069 WHAT IS GAINED IF SOME NERVOUS DISORDERS ARE HELPED BY BELIEF IF THE BELIEF ITSELF DEVASTATES OUR INTELLECTUAL CULTURE AND BRINGS THE MASSES DOWN AGAIN TO A VIEW OF THE WORLD WHICH HAS ALL THE EARMARKS OF BARBARISM
1355-39947-0070 THAT IS INDEED ONE OF THE CENTRAL DANGERS OF ALL NON MEDICAL SUGGESTIVE CURES THAT WHILE ANY BELIEF MAY CURE THROUGH THE MERE EMOTIONAL POWER OF THE ACT OF BELIEVING THE CONTENT OF THE BELIEF GAINS AN UNDESERVED APPEARANCE OF TRUTH
1355-39947-0071 ANY ABSURD SUPERSTITION CAN BECOME ACCREDITED BECAUSE ITS CURATIVE VALUE MAY BE EQUAL TO A TRULY VALUABLE SUGGESTION THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE OF THE COMMUNITY WOULD HAVE TO SUFFER GREATLY IF THE WAY TO BE FREED FROM BODILY SUFFERING
1355-39947-0072 HAD TO BE THE BELIEF IN THE METAPHYSICAL DOCTRINES OF MISSUS EDDY'S SCIENCE AND HEALTH FROM A CULTURAL VIEWPOINT TOO SUGGESTIVE THERAPEUTICS MUST STAND THE HIGHER THE MORE SHARPLY IT IS SEPARATED FROM SPECIAL PHILOSOPHICAL OR RELIGIOUS DOCTRINES
1355-39947-0073 NO THEORY OF THE WORLD AND OF GOD OUGHT TO GAIN AUTHORITY OVER THE MIND FROM SUCH AN EXTERNAL MOTIVE AS A BELIEF IN ITS CURATIVE EFFECTS FREEST FROM SUCH IMPLICATIONS IS CERTAINLY THE HYPNOTIC METHOD OF THE PHYSICIAN
1355-39947-0074 WHO DOES NOT NEED THE STRONG RELIGIOUS REENFORCEMENT OF THE SUGGESTION BECAUSE HE REENFORCES INSTEAD THE SUGGESTIBILITY OF THE PATIENT BY SLIGHT INFLUENCES ON HIS SENSES
1355-39947-0075 EVEN WHERE SOUND RELIGION WITHOUT SUPERSTITION AND WITHOUT PSEUDOPHILOSOPHY STANDS BEHIND THE THERAPEUTIC WORK THE COMMUNITY WILL NOT GIVE UP THE QUESTION WHETHER THE CHURCH DOES NOT NECESSARILY NEGLECT BY IT THE INTERESTS WHICH ARE SUPERIOR
1355-39947-0076 THE COMMUNITY BECOMES MORE AND MORE STRONGLY AWARE THAT TOO MANY FACTORS OF OUR MODERN SOCIETY URGE THE CHURCH TO UNDERTAKE NON RELIGIOUS WORK SOCIAL AID AND CHARITY WORK OUGHT TO BE FILLED WITH RELIGIOUS SPIRIT
1355-39947-0077 STILL MORE THAT IS TRUE OF THE HEALING OF THE SICK WHETHER OR NOT SUCH EXPANSION OF CHURCH ACTIVITY IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS SAPS THE VITAL STRENGTH OF RELIGION ITSELF IS INDEED A PROBLEM FOR THE WHOLE COMMUNITY
1355-39947-0078 THE FEAR SUGGESTS ITSELF THAT THE SPIRITUAL ACHIEVEMENT MAY BECOME HAMPERED THAT IN THE COMPETITION OF THE CHURCH WITH THE OTHER AGENCIES OF SOCIAL LIFE THE PARTICULAR CHURCH TASK MAY BE PUSHED TO THE BACKGROUND AND THAT THUS THE CHURCH
1355-39947-0079 IN IMITATING THAT WHICH OTHERS CAN DO JUST AS WELL OR BETTER LOSES THE POWER TO DO THAT WHICH THE CHURCH ALONE CAN DO THE FINAL OUTCOME IS THEREFORE PRACTICALLY IN EVERY WAY THE SAME FROM WHATEVER STARTING POINT WE MAY COME WE ARE LED TO THE CONVICTION
1355-39947-0080 THAT THE PHYSICIAN ALONE IS CALLED TO ADMINISTER PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC WORK BUT THAT HE NEEDS A THOROUGH PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAINING BESIDES HIS MEDICAL ONE BUT THE INTEREST OF THE COMMUNITY IS NOT ONLY A NEGATIVE ONE
1355-39947-0081 SOCIETY DOES NOT ONLY ASK WHERE PSYCHICAL TREATMENT CAN BE DANGEROUS BUT ASKS WITH NOT LESS RIGHT WHETHER THE SCHEME AND THE METHOD MIGHT NOT BE FRUCTIFIED FOR OTHER SOCIAL ENDS BESIDES THE MERE HEALING OF THE SICK IF PSYCHOTHERAPY DEMONSTRATES THAT FOR INSTANCE
1355-39947-0082 HYPNOTISM MAKES POSSIBLE THE RESHAPING OF A PATHOLOGICAL MIND IT IS A NATURAL THOUGHT TO USE THE SAME POWER FOR REMODELING PERHAPS THE LAZY OR THE INTEMPERATE THE CARELESS OR THE INATTENTIVE THE DISHONEST OR THE CRIMINAL MIND
1355-39947-0083 BOTH EDUCATORS AND CRIMINOLOGISTS HAVE INDEED OFTEN RAISED SUCH QUESTIONS AND SOCIAL REFORMERS HAVE NOT SELDOM SEEN THERE WIDE PERSPECTIVES FOR SOCIAL MOVEMENTS IN FUTURE TIMES
1355-39947-0084 THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH REMODELING ACTIVITY IS GIVEN BUT AS FAR AS EDUCATION IS CONCERNED CERTAINLY GRAVE MISGIVINGS OUGHT TO BE FELT WHEN WE SPOKE OF THE TREATMENT OF THE SICK
1355-39947-0085 WE HAD ALWAYS TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE SUGGESTION CURES SYMPTOMS BUT NOT DISEASES IN THE SAME WAY HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION MIGHT REENFORCE A SINGLE TRAIT BUT WOULD NOT REFORM THE PERSONALITY OF THE CHILD
1355-39947-0086 YES THE ARTIFICIAL REENFORCEMENT OF SUCH SPECIAL FEATURES WOULD DEPRIVE EDUCATION OF THAT WHICH IS THE MOST ESSENTIAL NAMELY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE POWER TO OVERCOME DIFFICULTIES BY OWN ENERGY
1355-39947-0087 WHEREVER A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF OWN WILL FORCE AND ATTENTION CAN BE EXPECTED TO OVERCOME THE ANTAGONISTIC INFLUENCE THERE ARTIFICIAL HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE OUGHT TO BE AVOIDED EVERYTHING OUGHT TO BE LEFT IN THAT CASE TO SUGGESTIONS WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS
1355-39947-0088 IN THE FORM OF GOOD EXAMPLE AND PERSUASIONS AUTHORITY AND DISCIPLINE LOVE AND SYMPATHY THAT HOLDS TRUE EVEN FOR VERY SLIGHT ABNORMALITIES WHICH SEEM STILL WITHIN THE LIMITS WHERE THE OWN ENERGIES CAN BRING ABOUT THE CURE FOR INSTANCE
1355-39947-0089 I HAVE STEADILY REFUSED REQUESTS OF STUDENTS AND OTHERS TO USE HYPNOTISM FOR THE PURPOSE OF OVERCOMING MERELY BAD HABITS SUCH AS THE HABIT OF BITING THE NAILS A CHILD WHO FINDS SOME DIFFICULTY IN STICKING SERIOUSLY TO HIS TASKS MIGHT LEARN NOW THIS
1355-39947-0090 AND NOW THAT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS BUT HE WOULD REMAIN ENTIRELY UNTRAINED FOR MASTERING THE NEXT LESSON IN THE SAME WAY SOME NAUGHTY TRAITS MIGHT BE ARTIFICIALLY REMOVED BUT THE CHILD WOULD NOT GAIN ANYTHING TOWARDS THE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT POWER
1355-39947-0091 OF SUPPRESSING AN UGLY TENDENCY BY HIS OWN EFFORT ALL THAT FINDS ITS LIMITS WHERE THE INHIBITIONS OR OBSTACLES IN THE BRAIN OF THE CHILD ARE TOO STRONG POSSIBLY TO BE OVERCOME BY THE OWN GOOD WILL BUT IN THAT CASE
1355-39947-0092 PSYCHOTHERAPY HAS ITS RIGHT THE FEEBLE MINDED AND THE RETARDED CHILD THE PERVERSE CHILD AND THE EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE CHILD BELONG UNDER THE CARE OF THE PHYSICIAN
1355-39947-0093 WHICH ARE AT HIS DISPOSAL STILL MORE COMPLEX IS THE CRIMINOLOGICAL PROBLEM IT SOUNDS LIKE AN EASY REMEDY FOR THE GREATEST SOCIAL CALAMITY IF IT IS PROPOSED SIMPLY TO HYPNOTIZE THE CRIMINAL AND TO SUPPLANT HIS ANTISOCIAL WILL BY A MORAL ONE
1355-39947-0094 AND IF THE ABSURDITY OF SUCH A PROPOSAL IS RECOGNIZED IT SEEMS TO MANY JUSTIFIED TO DEMAND SUCH AN INTRUSION AT LEAST IN THE CASE OF THE BORN CRIMINAL EVEN IF THE OCCASIONAL CRIMINAL CANNOT BE REACHED
1355-39947-0095 BUT THE CONCEPTION OF THE BORN CRIMINAL IS ALSO ONLY A LABEL WHICH IS SUPERFICIALLY USED FOR A GREAT VARIETY OF MINDS THAT MEN ARE BORN WITH A BRAIN WHICH NECESSARILY PRODUCES CRIMINAL ACTIONS IS NOT INDICATED BY ANY FACTS
1355-39947-0096 THE VARIETIES WHICH NATURE REALLY PRODUCES ARE BRAINS WHICH ARE MORE LIABLE THAN OTHERS TO PRODUCE ANTISOCIAL ACTIONS WE RECOGNIZED FROM THE START THAT THE ABNORMAL MIND NEVER INTRODUCES ANY NEW ELEMENTS BUT IS CHARACTERIZED ONLY BY A CHANGE OF PROPORTIONS
1355-39947-0097 THERE IS TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE OF A CERTAIN MENTAL PROCESS AND JUST FOR THAT REASON THERE MUST BE A STEADY AND CONTINUOUS TRANSITION FROM THE NORMAL TO THE ENTIRELY ABNORMAL
1363-135842-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR UNC BILLY AND OLD MISSUS POSSUM
1363-135842-0001 ALL THE WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL PETER RABBIT DID HIS BEST TO THINK WHO IT COULD BE WHO ATE FLESH YET WASN'T A MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF FLESH EATERS
1363-135842-0002 EVERY FEW HOPS HE WOULD STOP TO THINK BUT ALL HIS STOPPING AND ALL HIS THINKING WERE IN VAIN AND WHEN HE STARTED FOR SCHOOL THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS AS PUZZLED AS EVER
1363-135842-0003 ON HIS WAY THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST HE PASSED A CERTAIN TREE HE WAS JUST PAST AND NO MORE WHEN A FAMILIAR VOICE HAILED HIM
1363-135842-0004 WHAT'S YO HURRY PETER STOPPED ABRUPTLY AND LOOKED UP IN THAT TREE THERE PEERING DOWN AT HIM FROM A HOLE HIGH UP IN THE TRUNK WAS A SHARP WHITISH GRAY FACE
1363-135842-0005 WITH A PAIR OF TWINKLING BLACK EYES HELLO UNC BILLY CRIED PETER HOW ARE YOU AND OL MISSUS POSSUM PO'LY PETER PO'LY
1363-135842-0006 WE UNS HAVEN'T HAD BREAKFAST YET SO WE UNS ARE FEELING PO'LY REPLIED UNC BILLY WITH A GRIN A SUDDEN THOUGHT POPPED INTO PETER'S HEAD
1363-135842-0007 UNC POKED HIS HEAD A LITTLE FARTHER OUT AND PUT HIS HAND BEHIND HIS EAR AS IF HE WERE A LITTLE HARD OF HEARING
1363-135842-0008 AM I A WHAT HE DEMANDED
1363-135842-0009 REPEATED PETER AH RECKONS AH MIGHT BE IF AH KNEW WHAT IT WAS BUT AS LONG AS AH DON'T
1363-135842-0010 MISTER OPOSSUM BUT PETER WASN'T LISTENING THE FACT IS PETER HAD STARTED LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP FOR SCHOOL WITHOUT EVEN BEING POLITE ENOUGH TO SAY GOOD BY HE ARRIVED AT SCHOOL QUITE OUT OF BREATH
1363-135842-0011 WHAT DO YOU KNOW ASKED OLD MOTHER NATURE
1363-135842-0012 YET DOESN'T BELONG TO THE ORDER OF FLESH EATERS
1363-135842-0013 CRIED PETER RIGHT YOU ARE REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE HOWEVER DID YOU FIND IT OUT I DIDN'T EXACTLY FIND IT OUT I GUESSED IT REPLIED PETER
1363-135842-0014 ON MY WAY HERE I SAW UNC BILLY AND IT POPPED INTO MY HEAD RIGHT AWAY THAT HE WAS ONE WE HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT AND MUST BE THE ONE BUT IF HE EATS FLESH
1363-135842-0015 I DON'T SEE WHY HE ISN'T A MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF FLESH EATERS IT IS BECAUSE HE BELONGS TO A GROUP WHICH HAS SOMETHING WHICH MAKES THEM ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM ALL OTHER ANIMALS AND FOR THIS REASON
1363-135842-0016 THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN AN ORDER OF THEIR OWN EXPLAINED OLD MOTHER NATURE THEY BELONG TO THE ORDER OF MARSUPIALS WHICH MEANS POUCHED ANIMALS
1363-135842-0017 IT IS BECAUSE THE MOTHERS HAVE BIG POCKETS IN WHICH THEY CARRY THEIR BABIES OLD MISSUS POSSUM HAS JUST SUCH A POCKET
1363-135842-0018 THEY LOOK TOO FUNNY FOR ANYTHING THE OPOSSUMS ARE THE ONLY MARSUPIALS IN THIS COUNTRY CONTINUED OLD MOTHER NATURE
1363-135842-0019 NOW HAVE I MADE IT QUITE CLEAR WHY ALTHOUGH THEY EAT FLESH UNC BILLY AND OL MISSUS POSSUM ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE SAME BIG ORDER AS BUSTER BEAR AND THE OTHER FLESH EATERS EVERYBODY NODDED
1363-135842-0020 JUST THEN CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL SHOUTED HERE COMES UNC BILLY OL MISSUS POSSUM AND ALL THE LITTLE POSSUMS SURE ENOUGH DOWN THE LONE LITTLE PATH
1363-135842-0021 CAME THE POSSUM FAMILY AND A FUNNY LOOKING SIGHT THEY WERE UNC BILLY WAS WHITISH GRAY HIS FACE WHITER THAN THE REST OF HIM HE LOOKED AS IF HE HAD JUST GOTTEN OUT OF BED
1363-135842-0022 AND FORGOTTEN TO BRUSH HIS HAIR IT POINTED EVERY WHICH WAY HIS LEGS WERE DARK HIS FEET BLACK AND HIS TOES WHITE HIS EARS WERE WITHOUT ANY HAIR AT ALL
1363-135842-0023 AND WERE BLACK FOR THE LOWER HALF THE REST BEING WHITE HE HAD A LONG WHITISH TAIL WITHOUT ANY HAIR ON IT ALTOGETHER WITH HIS SHARP FACE AND NAKED TAIL
1363-135842-0024 HE LOOKED A GREAT DEAL AS THOUGH HE MIGHT BE A GIANT RAT BUT IF UNC BILLY WAS A FUNNY LOOKING FELLOW OL MISSUS POSSUM WAS EVEN MORE FUNNY LOOKING
1363-135842-0025 SHE SEEMED TO HAVE HEADS AND TAILS ALL OVER HER YOU SEE SHE HAD BROUGHT ALONG HER FAMILY AND OL MISSUS POSSUM IS ONE OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN LARGE FAMILIES
1363-135842-0026 THERE WERE TWELVE YOUNGSTERS AND THEY WERE EXACTLY LIKE THEIR PARENTS ONLY SMALL THEY WERE CLINGING ALL OVER OL MISSUS POSSUM SOME WERE ON HER BACK SOME WERE CLINGING TO HER SIDES
1363-135842-0027 AND A COUPLE WERE IN THE BIG POCKET WHERE THEY HAD SPENT THEIR BABYHOOD WE ALL DONE THOUGHT WE'D COME TO SCHOOL EXPLAINED UNC BILLY WITH A GRIN
1363-135842-0028 I'M GLAD YOU DID REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE YOU SEE THE REST OF YOUR FRIENDS HERE ARE A LITTLE CURIOUS ABOUT THE POSSUM FAMILY MEANWHILE OL MISSUS POSSUM WAS CLIMBING A TREE
1363-135842-0029 AND WHEN SHE HAD REACHED A COMFORTABLE CROTCH THE LITTLE POSSUMS LEFT HER AND BEGAN TO PLAY ABOUT IN THE TREE IT WAS THEN THAT IT APPEARED WHAT HANDY THINGS THOSE NAKED LITTLE TAILS WERE
1363-135842-0030 WHEN THE LITTLE POSSUMS CRAWLED OUT WHERE THE BRANCHES WERE SMALL THEY SIMPLY WRAPPED THEIR TAILS AROUND THE TWIGS TO KEEP FROM FALLING MY EXCLAIMED PETER
1363-135842-0031 THOSE CERTAINLY ARE HANDY TAILS HANDIEST TAILS EVER WAS DECLARED UNC BILLY
1363-135842-0032 SUPPOSE YOU CLIMB A TREE UNC BILLY AND SHOW YOUR FRIENDS HERE HOW YOU MANAGE TO GET THE EGGS FROM A NEST THAT YOU CANNOT REACH BY CRAWLING ALONG THE BRANCH ON WHICH IT IS PLACED SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE
1363-135842-0033 UNC BILLY GRINNED AND GOOD NATUREDLY STARTED UP A TREE HE CREPT OUT ON A BRANCH THAT OVERHUNG ANOTHER BRANCH WAY OUT WHERE THE BRANCH WAS SMALL CREPT UNC BILLY
1363-135842-0034 THEN HE WRAPPED THE END OF HIS TAIL AROUND THE BRANCH AND SWUNG HIMSELF OFF KEEPING HOLD OF THE BRANCH ONLY WITH HIS TAIL AND ONE HIND FOOT THEN
1363-135842-0035 STRETCHING DOWN FULL LENGTH HE COULD JUST REACH THE BRANCH BELOW HIM YOU SEE HE EXPLAINED IF THERE WAS A NEST ON THIS BRANCH DOWN HERE AH COULD GET THOSE EGGS WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE
1363-135842-0036 AGAIN UNC BILLY GRINNED AND THEN PULLED HIMSELF BACK TO THE OTHER BRANCH OLD MOTHER NATURE SHOOK HER HEAD REPROVINGLY UNC BILLY SAID SHE
1363-135842-0037 YOU ARE A BAD OLD RASCAL TO STEAL EGGS WHAT'S MORE
1363-135842-0038 IT IS A WONDER THAT BETWEEN YOU AND CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL ANY OF THE BIRDS SUCCEED IN RAISING FAMILIES AROUND HERE HAVE YOU VISITED FARMER BROWN'S HEN HOUSE LATELY UNC BILLY SHOOK HIS HEAD
1363-135842-0039 NOT LATELY SAID HE AH DONE GOT A DREADFUL SCARE THE LAST TIME AH WAS UP THERE
1363-135842-0040 WHERE IS YOUR HOME ASKED JOHNNY CHUCK I KNOW SAID PETER RABBIT IT'S UP IN A BIG HOLLOW TREE UNC BILLY LOOKED DOWN AT PETER
1363-135842-0041 SAID HE ARE POSSUMS FOUND ANYWHERE EXCEPT AROUND HERE INQUIRED HAPPY JACK YES INDEED REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE THEY ARE FOUND ALL DOWN THROUGH THE SUNNY SOUTH
1363-135842-0042 AND IN THE WARMER PARTS OF THE MIDDLE WEST UNC BILLY AND HIS RELATIVES ARE NOT FOND OF COLD WEATHER THEY PREFER TO BE WHERE THEY CAN BE REASONABLY WARM ALL THE YEAR ROUND SOME FOLKS THINK UNC BILLY ISN'T SMART
1363-135842-0043 BUT THOSE FOLKS DON'T KNOW UNC BILLY HE LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO THAT HE CAN'T RUN AS FAST AS SOME OTHERS SO HE HAS LEARNED TO DEPEND ON HIS WITS IN TIME OF DANGER WHAT DO YOU THINK HE DOES I
1363-135842-0044 KNOW CRIED PETER I SAW HIM DO IT ONCE FARMER BROWN'S BOY SURPRISED UNC BILLY AND UNC BILLY JUST FELL RIGHT OVER DEAD POOH THAT'S A STORY PETER RABBIT
1363-135842-0045 HOW COULD UNC BILLY HAVE FALLEN OVER DEAD AND BE ALIVE UP IN THAT TREE THIS VERY MINUTE CRIED HAPPY JACK I DIDN'T MEAN HE WAS REALLY DEAD BUT THAT HE LOOKED AS IF HE WERE DEAD EXPLAINED PETER
1363-135842-0046 AND HE DID TOO HE WAS THE DEADEST LOOKING THING I EVER SAW I THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD MYSELF I WAS WATCHING FROM A BRAMBLE TANGLE WHERE I WAS HIDING AND I CERTAINLY THOUGHT
1363-135842-0047 THE LIFE HAD BEEN SCARED RIGHT OUT OF UNC BILLY I GUESS FARMER BROWN'S BOY THOUGHT SO TOO HE PICKED UNC BILLY UP BY THE TAIL AND LOOKED HIM ALL OVER AND SAID YOU POOR LITTLE THING
1363-135842-0048 I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU UNC BILLY DIDN'T SO MUCH AS WINK AN EYE FARMER BROWN'S BOY WENT OFF UP THE PATH CARRYING UNC BILLY BY THE TAIL BY AND BY HE LAID UNC BILLY DOWN
1363-135842-0049 ON AN OLD STUMP WHILE HE WENT TO LOOK AT A NEST OF BLACKY THE CROW WHEN HE CAME BACK UNC BILLY WASN'T THERE I NEVER DID SEE UNC BILLY HURRY AS HE DID THE MINUTE FARMER BROWN'S BOY'S BACK WAS TURNED
1363-135842-0050 HE CAME TO LIFE AS SUDDENLY AS HE HAD DROPPED DEAD VERY GOOD PETER SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE SOME OTHER SMART LITTLE PEOPLE TRY THAT TRICK SOMETIMES
1363-135842-0051 BUT NONE OF THEM CAN DO IT AS WELL AS UNC BILLY POSSUM PRETENDING TO BE DEAD IN ORDER TO REMAIN ALIVE IS THE CLEVEREST THING UNC BILLY DOES
1363-139304-0000 CHAPTER THREE THE AWAKENING BUT WARMING WAS WRONG IN THAT AN AWAKENING CAME WHAT A WONDERFULLY COMPLEX THING THIS SIMPLE SEEMING UNITY
1363-139304-0001 THE SELF WHO CAN TRACE ITS REINTEGRATION AS MORNING AFTER MORNING WE AWAKEN THE FLUX AND CONFLUENCE OF ITS COUNTLESS FACTORS INTERWEAVING REBUILDING THE DIM FIRST STIRRINGS OF THE SOUL
1363-139304-0002 THE GROWTH AND SYNTHESIS OF THE UNCONSCIOUS TO THE SUBCONSCIOUS THE SUBCONSCIOUS TO DAWNING CONSCIOUSNESS UNTIL AT LAST WE RECOGNISE OURSELVES AGAIN AND AS IT HAPPENS TO MOST OF US AFTER THE NIGHT'S SLEEP
1363-139304-0003 SO IT WAS WITH GRAHAM AT THE END OF HIS VAST SLUMBER A DIM CLOUD OF SENSATION TAKING SHAPE A CLOUDY DREARINESS AND HE FOUND HIMSELF VAGUELY SOMEWHERE RECUMBENT FAINT BUT ALIVE
1363-139304-0004 THE PILGRIMAGE TOWARDS A PERSONAL BEING SEEMED TO TRAVERSE VAST GULFS TO OCCUPY EPOCHS GIGANTIC DREAMS THAT WERE TERRIBLE REALITIES AT THE TIME
1363-139304-0005 LEFT VAGUE PERPLEXING MEMORIES STRANGE CREATURES STRANGE SCENERY AS IF FROM ANOTHER PLANET THERE WAS A DISTINCT IMPRESSION TOO OF A MOMENTOUS CONVERSATION OF A NAME
1363-139304-0006 HE COULD NOT TELL WHAT NAME THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TO RECUR OF SOME QUEER LONG FORGOTTEN SENSATION OF VEIN AND MUSCLE OF A FEELING OF VAST HOPELESS EFFORT
1363-139304-0007 THE EFFORT OF A MAN NEAR DROWNING IN DARKNESS THEN CAME A PANORAMA OF DAZZLING UNSTABLE CONFLUENT SCENES GRAHAM BECAME AWARE THAT HIS EYES WERE OPEN
1363-139304-0008 AND REGARDING SOME UNFAMILIAR THING IT WAS SOMETHING WHITE THE EDGE OF SOMETHING A FRAME OF WOOD HE MOVED HIS HEAD SLIGHTLY FOLLOWING THE CONTOUR OF THIS SHAPE
1363-139304-0009 IT WENT UP BEYOND THE TOP OF HIS EYES HE TRIED TO THINK WHERE HE MIGHT BE DID IT MATTER SEEING HE WAS SO WRETCHED
1363-139304-0010 HE FELT THE FEATURELESS MISERY OF ONE WHO WAKES TOWARDS THE HOUR OF DAWN HE HAD AN UNCERTAIN SENSE OF WHISPERS AND FOOTSTEPS HASTILY RECEDING
1363-139304-0011 THE MOVEMENT OF HIS HEAD INVOLVED A PERCEPTION OF EXTREME PHYSICAL WEAKNESS HE SUPPOSED HE WAS IN BED IN THE HOTEL AT THE PLACE IN THE VALLEY BUT HE COULD NOT RECALL THAT WHITE EDGE HE MUST HAVE SLEPT
1363-139304-0012 HE REMEMBERED NOW THAT HE HAD WANTED TO SLEEP HE RECALLED THE CLIFF AND WATERFALL AGAIN AND THEN RECOLLECTED SOMETHING ABOUT TALKING TO A PASSER BY HOW LONG HAD HE SLEPT
1363-139304-0013 WHAT WAS THAT SOUND OF PATTERING FEET AND THAT RISE AND FALL LIKE THE MURMUR OF BREAKERS ON PEBBLES HE PUT OUT A LANGUID HAND TO REACH HIS WATCH FROM THE CHAIR WHEREON IT WAS HIS HABIT TO PLACE IT
1363-139304-0014 AND TOUCHED SOME SMOOTH HARD SURFACE LIKE GLASS THIS WAS SO UNEXPECTED THAT IT STARTLED HIM EXTREMELY QUITE SUDDENLY HE ROLLED OVER STARED FOR A MOMENT AND STRUGGLED INTO A SITTING POSITION
1363-139304-0015 THE EFFORT WAS UNEXPECTEDLY DIFFICULT AND IT LEFT HIM GIDDY AND WEAK AND AMAZED HE RUBBED HIS EYES THE RIDDLE OF HIS SURROUNDINGS WAS CONFUSING
1363-139304-0016 BUT HIS MIND WAS QUITE CLEAR EVIDENTLY HIS SLEEP HAD BENEFITED HIM HE WAS NOT IN A BED AT ALL AS HE UNDERSTOOD THE WORD BUT LYING NAKED ON A VERY SOFT AND YIELDING MATTRESS
1363-139304-0017 IN A TROUGH OF DARK GLASS THE MATTRESS WAS PARTLY TRANSPARENT A FACT HE OBSERVED WITH A SENSE OF INSECURITY AND BELOW IT WAS A MIRROR REFLECTING HIM GREYLY
1363-139304-0018 ABOUT HIS ARM AND HE SAW WITH A SHOCK THAT HIS SKIN WAS STRANGELY DRY AND YELLOW WAS BOUND A CURIOUS APPARATUS OF RUBBER BOUND SO CUNNINGLY
1363-139304-0019 THAT IT SEEMED TO PASS INTO HIS SKIN ABOVE AND BELOW AND THIS BED WAS PLACED IN A CASE OF GREENISH COLOURED GLASS AS IT SEEMED TO HIM A BAR IN THE WHITE FRAMEWORK OF WHICH HAD FIRST ARRESTED HIS ATTENTION
1363-139304-0020 IN THE CORNER OF THE CASE WAS A STAND OF GLITTERING AND DELICATELY MADE APPARATUS FOR THE MOST PART QUITE STRANGE APPLIANCES THOUGH A MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM THERMOMETER WAS RECOGNISABLE
1363-139304-0021 THE SLIGHTLY GREENISH TINT OF THE GLASS LIKE SUBSTANCE WHICH SURROUNDED HIM ON EVERY HAND OBSCURED WHAT LAY BEHIND BUT HE PERCEIVED IT WAS A VAST APARTMENT OF SPLENDID APPEARANCE
1363-139304-0022 AND WITH A VERY LARGE AND SIMPLE WHITE ARCHWAY FACING HIM CLOSE TO THE WALLS OF THE CAGE WERE ARTICLES OF FURNITURE A TABLE COVERED WITH A SILVERY CLOTH SILVERY LIKE THE SIDE OF A FISH
1363-139304-0023 A COUPLE OF GRACEFUL CHAIRS AND ON THE TABLE A NUMBER OF DISHES WITH SUBSTANCES PILED ON THEM A BOTTLE AND TWO GLASSES HE REALISED THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HUNGRY HE COULD SEE NO ONE
1363-139304-0024 AND AFTER A PERIOD OF HESITATION SCRAMBLED OFF THE TRANSLUCENT MATTRESS AND TRIED TO STAND ON THE CLEAN WHITE FLOOR OF HIS LITTLE APARTMENT HE HAD MISCALCULATED HIS STRENGTH HOWEVER
1363-139304-0025 AND STAGGERED AND PUT HIS HAND AGAINST THE GLASS LIKE PANE BEFORE HIM TO STEADY HIMSELF FOR A MOMENT IT RESISTED HIS HAND BENDING OUTWARD LIKE A DISTENDED BLADDER THEN IT BROKE WITH A SLIGHT REPORT
1363-139304-0026 AND VANISHED A PRICKED BUBBLE HE REELED OUT INTO THE GENERAL SPACE OF THE HALL GREATLY ASTONISHED HE CAUGHT AT THE TABLE TO SAVE HIMSELF KNOCKING ONE OF THE GLASSES TO THE FLOOR
1363-139304-0027 IT RANG BUT DID NOT BREAK AND SAT DOWN IN ONE OF THE ARMCHAIRS WHEN HE HAD A LITTLE RECOVERED HE FILLED THE REMAINING GLASS FROM THE BOTTLE AND DRANK A COLOURLESS LIQUID IT WAS BUT NOT WATER
1363-139304-0028 WITH A PLEASING FAINT AROMA AND TASTE AND A QUALITY OF IMMEDIATE SUPPORT AND STIMULUS HE PUT DOWN THE VESSEL AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM
1363-139304-0029 THE APARTMENT LOST NONE OF ITS SIZE AND MAGNIFICENCE NOW THAT THE GREENISH TRANSPARENCY THAT HAD INTERVENED WAS REMOVED THE ARCHWAY HE SAW LED TO A FLIGHT OF STEPS GOING DOWNWARD WITHOUT THE INTERMEDIATION OF A DOOR
1363-139304-0030 TO A SPACIOUS TRANSVERSE PASSAGE THIS PASSAGE RAN BETWEEN POLISHED PILLARS OF SOME WHITE VEINED SUBSTANCE OF DEEP ULTRAMARINE AND ALONG IT CAME THE SOUND OF HUMAN MOVEMENTS
1363-139304-0031 AND VOICES AND A DEEP UNDEVIATING DRONING NOTE HE SAT NOW FULLY AWAKE LISTENING ALERTLY FORGETTING THE VIANDS IN HIS ATTENTION
1363-139304-0032 THEN WITH A SHOCK HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WAS NAKED AND CASTING ABOUT HIM FOR COVERING SAW A LONG BLACK ROBE THROWN ON ONE OF THE CHAIRS BESIDE HIM THIS HE WRAPPED ABOUT HIM AND SAT DOWN AGAIN TREMBLING
1363-139304-0033 HIS MIND WAS STILL A SURGING PERPLEXITY CLEARLY HE HAD SLEPT AND HAD BEEN REMOVED IN HIS SLEEP BUT WHERE AND WHO WERE THOSE PEOPLE THE DISTANT CROWD BEYOND THE DEEP BLUE PILLARS
1363-139304-0034 BOSCASTLE HE POURED OUT AND PARTIALLY DRANK ANOTHER GLASS OF THE COLOURLESS FLUID WHAT WAS THIS PLACE THIS PLACE THAT TO HIS SENSES SEEMED SUBTLY QUIVERING LIKE A THING ALIVE
1363-139304-0035 HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM AT THE CLEAN AND BEAUTIFUL FORM OF THE APARTMENT UNSTAINED BY ORNAMENT AND SAW THAT THE ROOF WAS BROKEN IN ONE PLACE BY A CIRCULAR SHAFT FULL OF LIGHT
1363-139304-0036 AND AS HE LOOKED A STEADY SWEEPING SHADOW BLOTTED IT OUT AND PASSED AND CAME AGAIN AND PASSED BEAT BEAT THAT SWEEPING SHADOW HAD A NOTE OF ITS OWN IN THE SUBDUED TUMULT THAT FILLED THE AIR
1363-139304-0037 HE WOULD HAVE CALLED OUT BUT ONLY A LITTLE SOUND CAME INTO HIS THROAT THEN HE STOOD UP AND WITH THE UNCERTAIN STEPS OF A DRUNKARD MADE HIS WAY TOWARDS THE ARCHWAY HE STAGGERED DOWN THE STEPS
1363-139304-0038 TRIPPED ON THE CORNER OF THE BLACK CLOAK HE HAD WRAPPED ABOUT HIMSELF AND SAVED HIMSELF BY CATCHING AT ONE OF THE BLUE PILLARS THE PASSAGE RAN DOWN A COOL VISTA OF BLUE AND PURPLE
1363-139304-0039 AND ENDED REMOTELY IN A RAILED SPACE LIKE A BALCONY BRIGHTLY LIT AND PROJECTING INTO A SPACE OF HAZE A SPACE LIKE THE INTERIOR OF SOME GIGANTIC BUILDING BEYOND AND REMOTE
1363-139304-0040 WERE VAST AND VAGUE ARCHITECTURAL FORMS THE TUMULT OF VOICES ROSE NOW LOUD AND CLEAR AND ON THE BALCONY AND WITH THEIR BACKS TO HIM GESTICULATING AND APPARENTLY IN ANIMATED CONVERSATION
1363-139304-0041 WERE THREE FIGURES RICHLY DRESSED IN LOOSE AND EASY GARMENTS OF BRIGHT SOFT COLOURINGS THE NOISE OF A GREAT MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE POURED UP OVER THE BALCONY AND ONCE IT SEEMED
1363-139304-0042 THE TOP OF A BANNER PASSED AND ONCE SOME BRIGHTLY COLOURED OBJECT A PALE BLUE CAP OR GARMENT THROWN UP INTO THE AIR PERHAPS FLASHED ATHWART THE SPACE AND FELL THE SHOUTS SOUNDED LIKE ENGLISH
1363-139304-0043 THERE WAS A REITERATION OF WAKE HE HEARD SOME INDISTINCT SHRILL CRY AND ABRUPTLY THESE THREE MEN BEGAN LAUGHING HA HA HA LAUGHED ONE
1363-139304-0044 A RED HAIRED MAN IN A SHORT PURPLE ROBE WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES WHEN HE TURNED HIS EYES FULL OF MERRIMENT ALONG THE PASSAGE HIS FACE CHANGED THE WHOLE MAN CHANGED
1363-139304-0045 BECAME RIGID THE OTHER TWO TURNED SWIFTLY AT HIS EXCLAMATION AND STOOD MOTIONLESS THEIR FACES ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION OF CONSTERNATION AN EXPRESSION THAT DEEPENED INTO AWE
1455-134435-0000 THE GIRL WHO CAME INTO THE WORLD ON THAT NIGHT WHEN JESSE RAN THROUGH THE FIELDS CRYING TO GOD THAT HE BE GIVEN A SON HAD GROWN TO WOMANHOOD ON THE FARM
1455-134435-0001 AND WHEN NOT ANGRY SHE WAS OFTEN MOROSE AND SILENT IN WINESBURG IT WAS SAID THAT SHE DRANK HER HUSBAND THE BANKER
1455-134435-0002 BUT LOUISE COULD NOT BE MADE HAPPY SHE FLEW INTO HALF INSANE FITS OF TEMPER DURING WHICH SHE WAS SOMETIMES SILENT SOMETIMES NOISY AND QUARRELSOME SHE SWORE AND CRIED OUT IN HER ANGER SHE GOT A KNIFE FROM THE KITCHEN AND THREATENED HER HUSBAND'S LIFE
1455-134435-0003 SOMETIMES ON SUMMER AFTERNOONS SHE CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE AND GOT INTO HER CARRIAGE DISMISSING THE DRIVER SHE TOOK THE REINS IN HER OWN HANDS AND DROVE OFF AT TOP SPEED THROUGH THE STREETS
1455-134435-0004 TO THE PEOPLE OF THE TOWN IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SHE WANTED TO RUN THEM DOWN WHEN SHE HAD DRIVEN THROUGH SEVERAL STREETS TEARING AROUND CORNERS AND BEATING THE HORSES WITH THE WHIP SHE DROVE OFF INTO THE COUNTRY ON THE COUNTRY ROADS
1455-134435-0005 SHE BECAME THOUGHTFUL AND MUTTERED WORDS SOMETIMES TEARS CAME INTO HER EYES
1455-134435-0006 BUT FOR THE INFLUENCE OF HER HUSBAND AND THE RESPECT HE INSPIRED IN PEOPLE'S MINDS
1455-134435-0007 HE WAS TOO YOUNG THEN TO HAVE OPINIONS OF HIS OWN ABOUT PEOPLE BUT AT TIMES IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM NOT TO HAVE VERY DEFINITE OPINIONS ABOUT THE WOMAN WHO WAS HIS MOTHER DAVID WAS ALWAYS A QUIET ORDERLY BOY
1455-134435-0008 AND FOR A LONG TIME WAS THOUGHT BY THE PEOPLE OF WINESBURG TO BE SOMETHING OF A DULLARD HIS EYES WERE BROWN AND AS A CHILD HE HAD A HABIT OF LOOKING AT THINGS AND PEOPLE A LONG TIME WITHOUT APPEARING TO SEE WHAT HE WAS LOOKING AT
1455-134435-0009 WHEN HE HEARD HIS MOTHER SPOKEN OF HARSHLY OR WHEN HE OVERHEARD HER BERATING HIS FATHER HE WAS FRIGHTENED AND RAN AWAY TO HIDE SOMETIMES HE COULD NOT FIND A HIDING PLACE AND THAT CONFUSED HIM
1455-134435-0010 HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND TRIED NOT TO THINK OF ANYTHING HE HAD A HABIT OF TALKING ALOUD TO HIMSELF AND EARLY IN LIFE A SPIRIT OF QUIET SADNESS OFTEN TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM ON THE OCCASIONS WHEN DAVID WENT TO VISIT HIS GRANDFATHER ON THE BENTLEY FARM
1455-134435-0011 SOMETHING HAPPENED TO DAVID HE COULD NOT BEAR TO GO INTO THE HOUSE WHERE HIS MOTHER AND FATHER LIVED AND ON AN IMPULSE HE DECIDED TO RUN AWAY FROM HOME
1455-134435-0012 THE BOY'S IMAGINATION WAS EXCITED AND HE FANCIED THAT HE COULD SEE AND HEAR STRANGE THINGS IN THE DARKNESS INTO HIS MIND CAME THE CONVICTION THAT HE WAS WALKING AND RUNNING IN SOME TERRIBLE VOID WHERE NO ONE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE
1455-134435-0013 THE DARKNESS ABOUT HIM SEEMED LIMITLESS THE SOUND OF THE WIND BLOWING IN TREES WAS TERRIFYING WHEN A TEAM OF HORSES APPROACHED ALONG THE ROAD IN WHICH HE WALKED HE WAS FRIGHTENED AND CLIMBED A FENCE THROUGH A FIELD HE RAN UNTIL HE CAME
1455-134435-0014 INTO ANOTHER ROAD AND GETTING UPON HIS KNEES FELT OF THE SOFT GROUND WITH HIS FINGERS BUT FOR THE FIGURE OF HIS GRANDFATHER WHOM HE WAS AFRAID HE WOULD NEVER FIND IN THE DARKNESS HE THOUGHT THE WORLD MUST BE ALTOGETHER EMPTY
1455-134435-0015 WHEN HIS CRIES WERE HEARD BY A FARMER WHO WAS WALKING HOME FROM TOWN AND HE WAS BROUGHT BACK TO HIS FATHER'S HOUSE HE WAS SO TIRED AND EXCITED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HIM BY CHANCE DAVID'S FATHER KNEW THAT HE HAD DISAPPEARED
1455-134435-0016 ON THE STREET HE HAD MET THE FARM HAND FROM THE BENTLEY PLACE AND KNEW OF HIS SON'S RETURN TO TOWN WHEN THE BOY DID NOT COME HOME AN ALARM WAS SET UP AND JOHN HARDY WITH SEVERAL MEN OF THE TOWN WENT TO SEARCH THE COUNTRY
1455-134435-0017 THE REPORT THAT DAVID HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED RAN ABOUT THROUGH THE STREETS OF WINESBURG WHEN HE CAME HOME THERE WERE NO LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE BUT HIS MOTHER APPEARED AND CLUTCHED HIM EAGERLY IN HER ARMS DAVID THOUGHT SHE HAD SUDDENLY BECOME ANOTHER WOMAN
1455-134435-0018 FOR AN HOUR THE WOMAN SAT IN THE DARKNESS AND HELD HER BOY ALL THE TIME SHE KEPT TALKING IN A LOW VOICE DAVID COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT HAD SO CHANGED HER HER HABITUALLY DISSATISFIED FACE HAD BECOME HE THOUGHT
1455-134435-0019 THE MOST PEACEFUL AND LOVELY THING HE HAD EVER SEEN
1455-134435-0020 ON AND ON WENT HER VOICE IT WAS NOT
1455-134435-0021 BUT SHE MADE HIM HIDE AND BE SILENT UNTIL SHE HAD SENT THEM AWAY HE THOUGHT IT MUST BE A GAME HIS MOTHER AND THE MEN OF THE TOWN WERE PLAYING WITH HIM AND LAUGHED JOYOUSLY
1455-134435-0022 INTO HIS MIND CAME THE THOUGHT THAT HIS HAVING BEEN LOST AND FRIGHTENED IN THE DARKNESS WAS AN ALTOGETHER UNIMPORTANT MATTER
1455-134435-0023 HE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN WILLING TO GO THROUGH THE FRIGHTFUL EXPERIENCE A THOUSAND TIMES TO BE SURE OF FINDING AT THE END OF THE LONG BLACK ROAD A THING SO LOVELY AS HIS MOTHER HAD SUDDENLY BECOME
1455-134435-0024 DURING THE LAST YEARS OF YOUNG DAVID'S BOYHOOD HE SAW HIS MOTHER BUT SELDOM AND SHE BECAME FOR HIM JUST A WOMAN WITH WHOM HE HAD ONCE LIVED STILL HE COULD NOT GET HER FIGURE OUT OF HIS MIND AND AS HE GREW OLDER IT BECAME MORE DEFINITE
1455-134435-0025 WHEN HE WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD HE WENT TO THE BENTLEY FARM TO LIVE OLD JESSE CAME INTO TOWN AND FAIRLY DEMANDED THAT HE BE GIVEN CHARGE OF THE BOY THE OLD MAN WAS EXCITED AND DETERMINED ON HAVING HIS OWN WAY HE TALKED TO JOHN HARDY
1455-134435-0026 IT IS AN ATMOSPHERE NOT CORRUPTED BY MY PRESENCE SHE SAID SHARPLY
1455-134435-0027 DIFFERENT WITH HIM LOUISE TURNED AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM LEAVING THE TWO MEN TO SIT IN EMBARRASSED SILENCE AS VERY OFTEN HAPPENED SHE LATER STAYED IN HER ROOM FOR DAYS
1455-134435-0028 EVEN WHEN THE BOY'S CLOTHES WERE PACKED AND HE WAS TAKEN AWAY SHE DID NOT APPEAR THE LOSS OF HER SON MADE A SHARP BREAK IN HER LIFE AND SHE SEEMED LESS INCLINED TO QUARREL WITH HER HUSBAND JOHN HARDY THOUGHT IT HAD ALL TURNED OUT VERY WELL INDEED
1455-134435-0029 AND SO YOUNG DAVID WENT TO LIVE IN THE BENTLEY FARMHOUSE WITH JESSE TWO OF THE OLD FARMER'S SISTERS WERE ALIVE AND STILL LIVED IN THE HOUSE THEY WERE AFRAID OF JESSE AND RARELY SPOKE WHEN HE WAS ABOUT
1455-134435-0030 ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO HAD BEEN NOTED FOR HER FLAMING RED HAIR WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER WAS A BORN MOTHER AND BECAME THE BOY'S CARETAKER EVERY NIGHT WHEN HE HAD GONE TO BED SHE WENT INTO HIS ROOM AND SAT ON THE FLOOR
1455-134435-0031 WHEN HE BECAME DROWSY SHE BECAME BOLD AND WHISPERED THINGS THAT HE LATER THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE DREAMED HER SOFT LOW VOICE CALLED HIM ENDEARING NAMES
1455-134435-0032 AND HE DREAMED THAT HIS MOTHER HAD COME TO HIM AND THAT SHE HAD CHANGED SO THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS AS SHE HAD BEEN THAT TIME AFTER HE RAN AWAY HE ALSO GREW BOLD AND REACHING OUT HIS HAND STROKED THE FACE OF THE WOMAN ON THE FLOOR SO THAT SHE WAS ECSTATICALLY HAPPY
1455-134435-0033 BEGAN TO THINK THAT AT LAST HIS PRAYERS HAD BEEN ANSWERED ALTHOUGH HE WAS AT THAT TIME ONLY FIFTY FIVE YEARS OLD HE LOOKED SEVENTY AND WAS WORN OUT WITH MUCH THINKING AND SCHEMING
1455-134435-0034 THE EFFORT HE HAD MADE TO EXTEND HIS LAND HOLDINGS HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND THERE WERE FEW FARMS IN THE VALLEY THAT DID NOT BELONG TO HIM BUT UNTIL DAVID CAME HE WAS A BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED MAN
1455-134435-0035 THERE WERE TWO INFLUENCES AT WORK IN JESSE BENTLEY AND ALL HIS LIFE HIS MIND HAD BEEN A BATTLEGROUND FOR THESE INFLUENCES FIRST THERE WAS THE OLD THING IN HIM HE WANTED TO BE A MAN OF GOD AND A LEADER AMONG MEN OF GOD
1455-134435-0036 HIS WALKING IN THE FIELDS AND THROUGH THE FORESTS AT NIGHT HAD BROUGHT HIM CLOSE TO NATURE AND THERE WERE FORCES IN THE PASSIONATELY RELIGIOUS MAN THAT RAN OUT TO THE FORCES IN NATURE THE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT HAD COME TO HIM WHEN A DAUGHTER
1455-134435-0037 BUT HE NO LONGER DEMANDED SUCH RECOGNITION INSTEAD HE PRAYED FOR IT SOMETIMES HE WAS ALTOGETHER DOUBTFUL AND THOUGHT GOD HAD DESERTED THE WORLD
1455-134435-0038 HE HAD GROWN INTO MATURITY IN AMERICA IN THE YEARS AFTER THE CIVIL WAR AND HE LIKE ALL MEN OF HIS TIME HAD BEEN TOUCHED BY THE DEEP INFLUENCES THAT WERE AT WORK IN THE COUNTRY DURING THOSE YEARS WHEN MODERN INDUSTRIALISM WAS BEING BORN
1455-134435-0039 JESSE FORMED THE HABIT OF READING NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES HE INVENTED A MACHINE FOR THE MAKING OF FENCE OUT OF WIRE FAINTLY HE REALIZED THAT THE ATMOSPHERE OF OLD TIMES AND PLACES THAT HE HAD
1455-134435-0040 ALWAYS CULTIVATED IN HIS OWN MIND WAS STRANGE AND FOREIGN TO THE THING THAT WAS GROWING UP IN THE MINDS OF OTHERS THE BEGINNING OF THE MOST MATERIALISTIC AGE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD WHEN WARS WOULD BE FOUGHT WITHOUT PATRIOTISM WHEN MEN WOULD FORGET GOD AND
1455-134435-0041 ONLY PAY ATTENTION TO MORAL STANDARDS WHEN THE WILL TO POWER WOULD REPLACE THE WILL TO SERVE AND BEAUTY WOULD BE WELL NIGH FORGOTTEN IN THE TERRIBLE HEADLONG RUSH OF MANKIND TOWARD THE ACQUIRING OF POSSESSIONS WAS TELLING ITS STORY TO JESSE THE MAN OF GOD
1455-134435-0042 AS IT WAS TO THE MEN ABOUT HIM THE GREEDY THING IN HIM WANTED TO MAKE MONEY FASTER THAN IT COULD BE MADE BY TILLING THE LAND MORE THAN ONCE HE WENT INTO WINESBURG TO TALK WITH HIS SON IN LAW JOHN HARDY ABOUT IT YOU ARE A BANKER AND YOU WILL HAVE CHANCES I NEVER HAD
1455-134435-0043 BIG THINGS ARE GOING TO BE DONE IN THE COUNTRY
1455-134435-0044 YOU GET INTO IT I WISH I WERE YOUNGER AND HAD YOUR CHANCE
1455-134435-0045 AT ONE TIME IN HIS LIFE HE HAD BEEN THREATENED WITH PARALYSIS AND HIS LEFT SIDE REMAINED SOMEWHAT WEAKENED AS HE TALKED HIS LEFT EYELID TWITCHED LATER
1455-134435-0046 AND THE STARS CAME OUT IT WAS HARDER TO GET BACK THE OLD FEELING OF A CLOSE AND PERSONAL GOD WHO LIVED IN THE SKY OVERHEAD AND WHO MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT REACH OUT HIS HAND TOUCH HIM ON THE SHOULDER
1455-134435-0047 AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT GOD HAD AT LAST LOOKED WITH FAVOR UPON HIM AS FOR THE BOY ON THE FARM LIFE BEGAN TO REVEAL ITSELF TO HIM IN A THOUSAND NEW AND DELIGHTFUL WAYS THE KINDLY ATTITUDE OF ALL ABOUT HIM EXPANDED HIS QUIET NATURE
1455-134435-0048 AND HE LOST THE HALF TIMID HESITATING MANNER HE HAD ALWAYS HAD WITH HIS PEOPLE AT NIGHT WHEN HE WENT TO BED AFTER A LONG DAY OF ADVENTURES IN THE STABLES IN THE FIELDS OR DRIVING ABOUT FROM FARM TO FARM WITH HIS GRANDFATHER HE WANTED TO EMBRACE EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE
1455-134435-0049 IF SHERLEY BENTLEY THE WOMAN WHO CAME EACH NIGHT TO SIT ON THE FLOOR BY HIS BEDSIDE DID NOT APPEAR AT ONCE HE WENT TO THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS AND SHOUTED HIS YOUNG VOICE RINGING THROUGH THE NARROW HALLS WHERE FOR SO LONG THERE HAD BEEN A TRADITION OF SILENCE IN THE MORNING WHEN HE AWOKE AND LAY STILL IN BED
1455-134435-0050 THE SOUNDS THAT CAME IN TO HIM THROUGH THE WINDOWS FILLED HIM WITH DELIGHT HE THOUGHT WITH A SHUDDER OF THE LIFE IN THE HOUSE IN WINESBURG AND OF HIS MOTHER'S ANGRY VOICE THAT HAD ALWAYS MADE HIM TREMBLE THERE IN THE COUNTRY ALL SOUNDS WERE PLEASANT SOUNDS
1455-134435-0051 WHEN HE AWOKE AT DAWN THE BARNYARD BACK OF THE HOUSE ALSO AWOKE IN THE HOUSE PEOPLE STIRRED ABOUT ELIZA STOUGHTON THE HALF WITTED GIRL WAS POKED IN THE RIBS BY A FARM HAND AND GIGGLED NOISILY IN SOME DISTANT FIELD A COW BAWLED AND WAS ANSWERED
1455-134435-0052 BY THE CATTLE IN THE STABLES AND ONE OF THE FARM HANDS SPOKE SHARPLY TO THE HORSE HE WAS GROOMING BY THE STABLE DOOR DAVID LEAPED OUT OF BED AND RAN TO A WINDOW ALL OF THE PEOPLE STIRRING ABOUT EXCITED HIS MIND AND HE WONDERED WHAT HIS MOTHER WAS DOING
1455-134435-0053 SIX SEVEN HE SAID SLOWLY WETTING HIS FINGER AND MAKING STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN MARKS ON THE WINDOW LEDGE DAVID RAN TO PUT ON HIS TROUSERS AND SHIRT A FEVERISH DESIRE TO GET OUT OF DOORS TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM
1455-134435-0054 WHEN HE HAD RUN THROUGH THE LONG OLD HOUSE SHUTTING THE DOORS BEHIND HIM WITH A BANG HE CAME INTO THE BARNYARD AND LOOKED ABOUT WITH AN AMAZED AIR OF EXPECTANCY
1455-134435-0055 HENRY STRADER AN OLD MAN WHO HAD BEEN ON THE FARM SINCE JESSE CAME INTO POSSESSION AND WHO BEFORE DAVID'S TIME HAD NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO MAKE A JOKE MADE THE SAME JOKE EVERY MORNING IT AMUSED DAVID SO THAT HE LAUGHED AND CLAPPED HIS HANDS
1455-134435-0056 THEY RODE IN A COMFORTABLE OLD PHAETON DRAWN BY THE WHITE HORSE THE OLD MAN SCRATCHED HIS THIN WHITE BEARD AND TALKED TO HIMSELF OF HIS PLANS FOR INCREASING THE PRODUCTIVENESS OF THE FIELDS THEY VISITED AND OF GOD'S PART IN THE PLANS ALL MEN MADE
1455-134435-0057 SOMETIMES HE LOOKED AT DAVID AND SMILED HAPPILY AND THEN FOR A LONG TIME HE APPEARED TO FORGET THE BOY'S EXISTENCE
1455-134435-0058 WHEN HE HAD FIRST COME OUT OF THE CITY TO LIVE ON THE LAND
1455-134435-0059 JESSE AND HIS GRANDSON WERE DRIVING IN A DISTANT PART OF THE VALLEY SOME MILES FROM HOME A FOREST CAME DOWN TO THE ROAD AND THROUGH THE FOREST WINE CREEK WRIGGLED ITS WAY OVER STONES TOWARD A DISTANT RIVER
1455-134435-0060 ALL THE AFTERNOON JESSE HAD BEEN IN A MEDITATIVE MOOD AND NOW HE BEGAN TO TALK HIS MIND WENT BACK TO THE NIGHT WHEN HE HAD BEEN FRIGHTENED BY THOUGHTS OF A GIANT THAT MIGHT COME TO ROB AND PLUNDER HIM OF HIS POSSESSIONS
1455-134435-0061 AND AGAIN AS ON THAT NIGHT WHEN HE HAD RUN THROUGH THE FIELDS CRYING FOR A SON HE BECAME EXCITED TO THE EDGE OF INSANITY
1455-134435-0062 WHEN A RABBIT JUMPED UP AND RAN AWAY THROUGH THE WOODS HE CLAPPED HIS HANDS AND DANCED WITH DELIGHT
1455-134435-0063 JESSE BENTLEY WENT ALONG UNDER THE TREES WITH HIS HEAD BOWED AND WITH HIS MIND IN A FERMENT HIS EARNESTNESS AFFECTED THE BOY WHO PRESENTLY BECAME SILENT AND A LITTLE ALARMED
1455-134435-0064 THAT THE PRESENCE OF THE BOY AND MAN ON THEIR KNEES IN SOME LONELY SPOT IN THE FOREST WOULD MAKE THE MIRACLE HE HAD BEEN WAITING FOR ALMOST INEVITABLE
1455-134435-0065 IT WAS IN JUST SUCH A PLACE AS THIS THAT OTHER DAVID TENDED THE SHEEP WHEN HIS FATHER CAME AND TOLD HIM TO GO DOWN UNTO SAUL HE MUTTERED
1455-134435-0066 HE CLIMBED OVER A FALLEN LOG AND WHEN HE HAD COME TO AN OPEN PLACE AMONG THE TREES HE DROPPED UPON HIS KNEES AND BEGAN TO PRAY IN A LOUD VOICE A KIND OF TERROR HE HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE TOOK POSSESSION OF DAVID
1455-134435-0067 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS IN THE PRESENCE NOT ONLY OF HIS GRANDFATHER BUT OF SOMEONE ELSE SOMEONE WHO MIGHT HURT HIM SOMEONE WHO WAS NOT KINDLY BUT DANGEROUS AND BRUTAL
1455-134435-0068 WHEN JESSE BENTLEY ABSORBED IN HIS OWN IDEA SUDDENLY AROSE AND ADVANCED TOWARD HIM HIS TERROR GREW UNTIL HIS WHOLE BODY SHOOK IN THE WOODS AN INTENSE SILENCE SEEMED TO LIE OVER EVERYTHING AND SUDDENLY OUT OF THE SILENCE CAME THE OLD MAN'S HARSH AND INSISTENT VOICE
1455-134435-0069 GRIPPING THE BOY'S SHOULDERS JESSE TURNED HIS FACE TO THE SKY AND SHOUTED THE WHOLE LEFT SIDE OF HIS FACE TWITCHED AND HIS HAND ON THE BOY'S SHOULDER TWITCHED ALSO MAKE A SIGN TO ME GOD HE CRIED HERE I STAND WITH THE BOY DAVID
1455-134435-0070 COME DOWN TO ME OUT OF THE SKY AND MAKE THY PRESENCE KNOWN TO ME WITH A CRY OF FEAR DAVID TURNED AND SHAKING HIMSELF LOOSE FROM THE HANDS THAT HELD HIM RAN AWAY THROUGH THE FOREST
1455-134435-0071 THE MAN DID NOT LOOK LIKE HIS GRANDFATHER THE CONVICTION THAT SOMETHING STRANGE AND TERRIBLE HAD HAPPENED THAT BY SOME MIRACLE A NEW AND DANGEROUS PERSON HAD COME INTO THE BODY OF THE KINDLY OLD MAN TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM
1455-134435-0072 ON AND ON HE RAN DOWN THE HILLSIDE SOBBING AS HE RAN WHEN HE FELL OVER THE ROOTS OF A TREE AND IN FALLING STRUCK HIS HEAD
1455-134435-0073 AND HE AWOKE TO FIND THE OLD MAN'S HAND STROKING HIS HEAD TENDERLY THAT THE TERROR LEFT HIM
1455-138263-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN GRAVE QUESTIONS
1455-138263-0001 AND BARBICANE AND HIS TWO COMPANIONS WATCHED WITH SCRUPULOUS ATTENTION THE BRILLIANT RAYS WHICH THE CELEBRATED MOUNTAIN SHED SO CURIOUSLY OVER THE HORIZON WHAT WAS THIS RADIANT GLORY WHAT
1455-138263-0002 SOME TWELVE MILES OTHERS THIRTY MILES BROAD
1455-138263-0003 AND SEEMED TO COVER PARTICULARLY TOWARD THE EAST THE NORTHEAST AND THE NORTH THE HALF OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE ONE OF THESE JETS EXTENDED AS FAR AS THE CIRCLE OF NEANDER SITUATED ON THE FORTIETH MERIDIAN
1455-138263-0004 ANOTHER BY A SLIGHT CURVE FURROWED THE SEA OF NECTAR BREAKING AGAINST
1455-138263-0005 WITH A LUMINOUS NETWORK WHAT WAS THE ORIGIN OF THESE SPARKLING RAYS WHICH SHONE ON THE PLAINS AS WELL AS ON THE RELIEFS AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY MIGHT BE ALL STARTED FROM A COMMON CENTER THE CRATER
1455-138263-0006 THEY SPRANG FROM HIM HERSCHEL ATTRIBUTED THEIR BRILLIANCY TO CURRENTS OF LAVA CONGEALED BY THE COLD AN OPINION HOWEVER WHICH HAS NOT BEEN GENERALLY ADOPTED
1455-138263-0007 BECAUSE THE REGULARITY OF THESE LUMINOUS LINES AND THE VIOLENCE NECESSARY TO CARRY VOLCANIC MATTER TO SUCH DISTANCES IS INEXPLICABLE
1455-138263-0008 BY JOVE REPLIED MICHEL ARDAN
1455-138263-0009 INDEED SAID BARBICANE INDEED CONTINUED MICHEL IT IS ENOUGH TO SAY
1455-138263-0010 WELL REPLIED BARBICANE SMILING AND WHAT HAND WOULD BE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO THROW A BALL TO GIVE SUCH A SHOCK AS THAT THE HAND IS NOT NECESSARY ANSWERED NICHOLL NOT AT ALL CONFOUNDED
1455-138263-0011 THE SHOCK WHICH PRODUCED THAT RENT
1455-138263-0012 A CONTRACTION SOMETHING LIKE A LUNAR STOMACH ACHE SAID MICHEL ARDAN BESIDES ADDED BARBICANE THIS OPINION IS THAT OF AN ENGLISH SAVANT
1455-138263-0013 THAT NASMYTH WAS NO FOOL REPLIED MICHEL
1455-138263-0014 THEIR PROJECTILE SATURATED WITH LUMINOUS GLEAMS IN THE DOUBLE IRRADIATION OF SUN AND MOON MUST HAVE APPEARED LIKE AN INCANDESCENT GLOBE
1455-138263-0015 TO INTENSE HEAT NATURE WAS THUS PREPARING THEM TO BECOME SELENITES BECOME SELENITES THAT IDEA BROUGHT UP ONCE MORE THE QUESTION OF THE HABITABILITY OF THE MOON AFTER WHAT THEY HAD SEEN COULD THE TRAVELERS SOLVE IT
1455-138263-0016 WOULD THEY DECIDE FOR OR AGAINST IT MICHEL ARDAN PERSUADED HIS TWO FRIENDS TO FORM AN OPINION AND ASKED THEM DIRECTLY IF THEY THOUGHT THAT MEN AND ANIMALS WERE REPRESENTED IN THE LUNAR WORLD
1455-138263-0017 I THINK THAT WE CAN ANSWER SAID BARBICANE BUT ACCORDING TO MY IDEA THE QUESTION OUGHT NOT TO BE PUT IN THAT FORM I ASK IT TO BE PUT DIFFERENTLY PUT IT YOUR OWN WAY REPLIED MICHEL
1455-138263-0018 HERE IT IS CONTINUED BARBICANE THE PROBLEM IS A DOUBLE ONE AND REQUIRES A DOUBLE SOLUTION IS THE MOON HABITABLE HAS THE MOON EVER BEEN INHABITABLE GOOD
1455-138263-0019 REPLIED NICHOLL FIRST LET US SEE WHETHER THE MOON IS HABITABLE TO TELL THE TRUTH I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT ANSWERED MICHEL AND I ANSWER IN THE NEGATIVE CONTINUED BARBICANE
1455-138263-0020 IN HER ACTUAL STATE WITH HER SURROUNDING ATMOSPHERE CERTAINLY VERY MUCH REDUCED HER SEAS FOR THE MOST PART DRIED UP HER INSUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF WATER RESTRICTED VEGETATION SUDDEN ALTERNATIONS OF COLD AND HEAT
1455-138263-0021 HER DAYS AND NIGHTS OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HOURS THE MOON DOES NOT SEEM HABITABLE TO ME NOR DOES SHE SEEM PROPITIOUS TO ANIMAL DEVELOPMENT NOR SUFFICIENT FOR THE WANTS OF EXISTENCE AS WE UNDERSTAND IT
1455-138263-0022 AGREED REPLIED NICHOLL BUT IS NOT THE MOON HABITABLE FOR CREATURES DIFFERENTLY ORGANIZED FROM OURSELVES
1455-138263-0023 SEEMED TO US TO MOVE ON THE MOON'S SURFACE
1455-138263-0024 AND WHAT HAVE WE SEEN EVERYWHERE AND ALWAYS THE GEOLOGICAL WORKS OF NATURE NEVER THE WORK OF MAN IF THEN THERE EXIST REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM ON THE MOON
1455-138263-0025 THEY MUST HAVE FLED TO THOSE UNFATHOMABLE CAVITIES WHICH THE EYE CANNOT REACH WHICH I CANNOT ADMIT FOR THEY MUST HAVE LEFT TRACES OF THEIR PASSAGE ON THOSE PLAINS WHICH THE ATMOSPHERE MUST COVER HOWEVER SLIGHTLY RAISED IT MAY BE
1455-138263-0026 THESE TRACES ARE NOWHERE VISIBLE THERE REMAINS BUT ONE HYPOTHESIS THAT OF A LIVING RACE TO WHICH MOTION WHICH IS LIFE IS FOREIGN ONE MIGHT AS WELL SAY LIVING CREATURES WHICH DO NOT LIVE REPLIED MICHEL
1455-138263-0027 THE SCIENTIFIC COMMISSION ASSEMBLED IN THE PROJECTILE OF THE GUN CLUB AFTER HAVING FOUNDED THEIR ARGUMENT ON FACTS RECENTLY OBSERVED DECIDE UNANIMOUSLY UPON THE QUESTION OF THE HABITABILITY OF THE MOON NO THE MOON
1455-138263-0028 SAID NICHOLL LET US ATTACK THE SECOND QUESTION AN INDISPENSABLE COMPLEMENT OF THE FIRST I ASK THE HONORABLE COMMISSION IF THE MOON IS NOT HABITABLE HAS SHE EVER BEEN INHABITED CITIZEN BARBICANE
1455-138263-0029 MY FRIENDS REPLIED BARBICANE I DID NOT UNDERTAKE THIS JOURNEY IN ORDER TO FORM AN OPINION ON THE PAST HABITABILITY OF OUR SATELLITE BUT I WILL ADD THAT OUR PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS ONLY CONFIRM ME IN THIS OPINION
1455-138263-0030 I BELIEVE INDEED I AFFIRM THAT THE MOON HAS BEEN INHABITED BY A HUMAN RACE ORGANIZED LIKE OUR OWN THAT SHE HAS PRODUCED ANIMALS ANATOMICALLY FORMED LIKE THE TERRESTRIAL ANIMALS
1455-138263-0031 BUT I ADD THAT THESE RACES HUMAN AND ANIMAL HAVE HAD THEIR DAY AND ARE NOW FOREVER EXTINCT
1455-138263-0032 RELATIVELY THE ORGANIZING FORCE OF MATTER HAS BEEN MUCH MORE VIOLENT IN THE INTERIOR OF THE MOON THAN IN THE INTERIOR OF THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE THE ACTUAL STATE OF THIS CRACKED TWISTED AND BURST DISC ABUNDANTLY PROVES THIS
1455-138263-0033 THE MOON AND THE EARTH WERE NOTHING BUT GASEOUS MASSES ORIGINALLY
1455-138263-0034 CONTINUED BARBICANE AN ATMOSPHERE SURROUNDED IT
1455-138263-0035 FOR EXAMPLE ITS DAYS AND NIGHTS OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HOURS AT THE TERRESTRIAL POLES THEY LAST SIX MONTHS SAID MICHEL AN ARGUMENT OF LITTLE VALUE SINCE THE POLES ARE NOT INHABITED LET US OBSERVE MY FRIENDS CONTINUED BARBICANE
1455-138263-0036 THAT IF IN THE ACTUAL STATE OF THE MOON ITS LONG NIGHTS AND LONG DAYS CREATED DIFFERENCES OF TEMPERATURE INSUPPORTABLE TO ORGANIZATION IT WAS NOT SO AT THE HISTORICAL PERIOD OF TIME THE ATMOSPHERE ENVELOPED THE DISC WITH A FLUID MANTLE
1455-138263-0037 VAPOR DEPOSITED ITSELF IN THE SHAPE OF CLOUDS THIS NATURAL SCREEN TEMPERED THE ARDOR OF THE SOLAR RAYS AND RETAINED THE NOCTURNAL RADIATION
1455-138263-0038 LIGHT LIKE HEAT CAN DIFFUSE ITSELF IN THE AIR HENCE AN EQUALITY BETWEEN THE INFLUENCES WHICH NO LONGER EXISTS NOW THAT ATMOSPHERE HAS ALMOST ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED AND NOW I AM GOING TO ASTONISH YOU
1455-138263-0039 ASTONISH US SAID MICHEL ARDAN I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT AT THE PERIOD WHEN THE MOON WAS INHABITED THE NIGHTS AND DAYS DID NOT LAST THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HOURS AND WHY
1455-138263-0040 ASKED NICHOLL QUICKLY BECAUSE MOST PROBABLY THEN THE ROTARY MOTION OF THE MOON UPON HER AXIS WAS NOT EQUAL TO HER REVOLUTION AN EQUALITY WHICH PRESENTS EACH PART OF HER DISC DURING FIFTEEN DAYS TO THE ACTION OF THE SOLAR RAYS
1455-138263-0041 GRANTED REPLIED NICHOLL BUT WHY SHOULD NOT THESE TWO MOTIONS HAVE BEEN EQUAL AS THEY ARE REALLY SO BECAUSE THAT EQUALITY HAS ONLY BEEN DETERMINED BY TERRESTRIAL ATTRACTION
1455-138263-0042 AND WHO CAN SAY THAT THIS ATTRACTION WAS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO ALTER THE MOTION OF THE MOON AT THAT PERIOD WHEN THE EARTH WAS STILL FLUID JUST SO REPLIED NICHOLL AND WHO CAN SAY THAT THE MOON HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SATELLITE OF THE EARTH
1455-138263-0043 EXCLAIMED MICHEL ARDAN THAT THE MOON DID NOT EXIST BEFORE THE EARTH THEIR IMAGINATIONS CARRIED THEM AWAY INTO AN INDEFINITE FIELD OF HYPOTHESIS BARBICANE SOUGHT TO RESTRAIN THEM
1455-138263-0044 THOSE SPECULATIONS ARE TOO HIGH SAID HE PROBLEMS UTTERLY INSOLUBLE
1455-138263-0045 LET US ONLY ADMIT THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE PRIMORDIAL ATTRACTION AND THEN BY THE INEQUALITY OF THE TWO MOTIONS OF ROTATION AND REVOLUTION
1455-138263-0046 BESIDES EVEN WITHOUT THESE CONDITIONS LIFE WAS POSSIBLE AND SO ASKED MICHEL ARDAN HUMANITY HAS DISAPPEARED FROM THE MOON YES REPLIED BARBICANE
1455-138263-0047 AFTER HAVING DOUBTLESS REMAINED PERSISTENTLY FOR MILLIONS OF CENTURIES
1455-138263-0048 AS THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE WILL ONE DAY BECOME BY COOLING BY COOLING CERTAINLY REPLIED BARBICANE AS THE INTERNAL FIRES BECAME EXTINGUISHED
1455-138263-0049 AND THE INCANDESCENT MATTER CONCENTRATED ITSELF THE LUNAR CRUST COOLED BY DEGREES THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE PHENOMENA SHOWED THEMSELVES IN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ORGANIZED BEINGS AND BY THE DISAPPEARANCE OF VEGETATION SOON THE ATMOSPHERE WAS RAREFIED
1455-138263-0050 PROBABLY WITHDRAWN BY TERRESTRIAL ATTRACTION THEN AERIAL DEPARTURE OF RESPIRABLE AIR AND DISAPPEARANCE OF WATER BY MEANS OF EVAPORATION AT THIS PERIOD THE MOON BECOMING UNINHABITABLE WAS NO LONGER INHABITED IT WAS A DEAD WORLD
1455-138263-0051 AND HAVE THEY CALCULATED THE TIME WHICH OUR UNFORTUNATE SPHERE WILL TAKE TO COOL CERTAINLY AND YOU KNOW THESE CALCULATIONS PERFECTLY
1455-138263-0052 BUT SPEAK THEN MY CLUMSY SAVANT EXCLAIMED MICHEL ARDAN FOR YOU MAKE ME BOIL WITH IMPATIENCE VERY WELL MY GOOD MICHEL REPLIED BARBICANE QUIETLY WE KNOW WHAT DIMINUTION OF TEMPERATURE THE EARTH UNDERGOES IN THE LAPSE OF A CENTURY
1455-138263-0053 BE BROUGHT DOWN TO ZERO FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS EXCLAIMED MICHEL AH I BREATHE AGAIN REALLY I WAS FRIGHTENED TO HEAR YOU I IMAGINED THAT WE HAD NOT MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND YEARS TO LIVE
1455-138263-0054 BARBICANE AND NICHOLL COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AT THEIR COMPANION'S UNEASINESS
1455-138263-0055 WHICH HAD JUST BEEN CONSIDERED AGAIN HAS THE MOON BEEN INHABITED HE ASKED THE ANSWER WAS UNANIMOUSLY IN THE AFFIRMATIVE BUT DURING THIS DISCUSSION FRUITFUL IN SOMEWHAT HAZARDOUS THEORIES
1455-138263-0056 THE PROJECTILE WAS RAPIDLY LEAVING THE MOON THE LINEAMENTS FADED AWAY FROM THE TRAVELERS EYES MOUNTAINS WERE CONFUSED IN THE DISTANCE AND OF ALL THE WONDERFUL STRANGE AND FANTASTICAL FORM OF THE EARTH'S SATELLITE THERE SOON REMAINED NOTHING
150-126107-0000 BUT AS SURE AS HE FOUND A PRINCESS HE FOUND SOME FAULT IN HER OF COURSE HE COULD NOT MARRY A MERE WOMAN HOWEVER BEAUTIFUL AND THERE WAS NO PRINCESS TO BE FOUND WORTHY OF HIM
150-126107-0001 WHETHER THE PRINCE WAS SO NEAR PERFECTION THAT HE HAD A RIGHT TO DEMAND PERFECTION ITSELF I CANNOT PRETEND TO SAY ALL I KNOW IS THAT HE WAS A FINE HANDSOME
150-126107-0002 BRAVE GENEROUS WELL BRED AND WELL BEHAVED YOUTH AS ALL PRINCES ARE IN HIS WANDERINGS HE HAD COME ACROSS SOME REPORTS ABOUT OUR PRINCESS
150-126107-0003 HE NEVER DREAMED THAT SHE COULD BEWITCH HIM FOR WHAT INDEED COULD A PRINCE DO WITH A PRINCESS THAT HAD LOST HER GRAVITY WHO COULD TELL WHAT SHE MIGHT NOT LOSE NEXT SHE MIGHT LOSE HER VISIBILITY OR HER TANGIBILITY
150-126107-0004 OR IN SHORT THE POWER OF MAKING IMPRESSIONS UPON THE RADICAL SENSORIUM SO THAT HE SHOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO TELL WHETHER SHE WAS DEAD OR ALIVE OF COURSE HE MADE NO FURTHER INQUIRIES ABOUT HER
150-126107-0005 ONE DAY HE LOST SIGHT OF HIS RETINUE IN A GREAT FOREST THESE FORESTS ARE VERY USEFUL IN DELIVERING PRINCES FROM THEIR COURTIERS LIKE A SIEVE THAT KEEPS BACK THE BRAN THEN THE PRINCES GET AWAY TO FOLLOW THEIR FORTUNES
150-126107-0006 IN THIS WAY THEY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THE PRINCESSES WHO ARE FORCED TO MARRY BEFORE THEY HAVE HAD A BIT OF FUN I WISH OUR PRINCESSES GOT LOST IN A FOREST SOMETIMES ONE LOVELY EVENING AFTER WANDERING ABOUT FOR MANY DAYS
150-126107-0007 HE FOUND THAT HE WAS APPROACHING THE OUTSKIRTS OF THIS FOREST FOR THE TREES HAD GOT SO THIN THAT HE COULD SEE THE SUNSET THROUGH THEM AND HE SOON CAME UPON A KIND OF HEATH NEXT HE CAME UPON SIGNS OF HUMAN NEIGHBOURHOOD
150-126107-0008 AT LENGTH HE ENTERED ANOTHER WOOD NOT A WILD FOREST BUT A CIVILIZED WOOD THROUGH WHICH A FOOTPATH LED HIM TO THE SIDE OF A LAKE ALONG THIS PATH THE PRINCE PURSUED HIS WAY THROUGH THE GATHERING DARKNESS
150-126107-0009 SUDDENLY HE PAUSED AND LISTENED STRANGE SOUNDS CAME ACROSS THE WATER IT WAS IN FACT THE PRINCESS LAUGHING NOW THERE WAS SOMETHING ODD IN HER LAUGH AS I HAVE ALREADY HINTED
150-126107-0010 FOR THE HATCHING OF A REAL HEARTY LAUGH REQUIRES THE INCUBATION OF GRAVITY AND PERHAPS THIS WAS HOW THE PRINCE MISTOOK THE LAUGHTER FOR SCREAMING LOOKING OVER THE LAKE HE SAW SOMETHING WHITE IN THE WATER AND IN AN INSTANT HE HAD TORN OFF HIS TUNIC
150-126107-0011 NOW I CANNOT TELL HOW IT CAME ABOUT WHETHER SHE PRETENDED TO BE DROWNING OR WHETHER HE FRIGHTENED HER OR CAUGHT HER SO AS TO EMBARRASS HER BUT CERTAINLY HE BROUGHT HER TO SHORE IN A FASHION IGNOMINIOUS TO A SWIMMER
150-126107-0012 AND MORE NEARLY DROWNED THAN SHE HAD EVER EXPECTED TO BE FOR THE WATER HAD GOT INTO HER THROAT AS OFTEN AS SHE HAD TRIED TO SPEAK AT THE PLACE TO WHICH HE BORE HER THE BANK WAS ONLY A FOOT OR TWO ABOVE THE WATER
150-126107-0013 SO HE GAVE HER A STRONG LIFT OUT OF THE WATER TO LAY HER ON THE BANK BUT HER GRAVITATION CEASING THE MOMENT SHE LEFT THE WATER AWAY SHE WENT UP INTO THE AIR SCOLDING AND SCREAMING
150-126107-0014 YOU NAUGHTY NAUGHTY NAUGHTY NAUGHTY MAN SHE CRIED NO ONE HAD EVER SUCCEEDED IN PUTTING HER INTO A PASSION BEFORE WHEN THE PRINCE SAW HER ASCEND HE THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE BEEN BEWITCHED
150-126107-0015 THE PRINCE MEANTIME STOOD IN THE WATER STARING AND FORGETTING TO GET OUT BUT THE PRINCESS DISAPPEARING HE SCRAMBLED ON SHORE AND WENT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TREE
150-126107-0016 UNTIL REACHING THE GROUND AND SEEING HIM STANDING THERE SHE CAUGHT HOLD OF HIM AND SAID I'LL TELL PAPA OH NO YOU WON'T RETURNED THE PRINCE YES I WILL SHE PERSISTED
150-126107-0017 WHAT BUSINESS HAD YOU TO PULL ME DOWN OUT OF THE WATER AND THROW ME TO THE BOTTOM OF THE AIR I NEVER DID YOU ANY HARM PARDON ME I DID NOT MEAN TO HURT YOU I DON'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE ANY BRAINS AND THAT IS A WORSE LOSS THAN YOUR WRETCHED GRAVITY
150-126107-0018 I PITY YOU THE PRINCE NOW SAW THAT HE HAD COME UPON THE BEWITCHED PRINCESS AND HAD ALREADY OFFENDED HER BUT BEFORE HE COULD THINK WHAT TO SAY NEXT SHE BURST OUT ANGRILY GIVING A STAMP WITH HER FOOT
150-126107-0019 THAT WOULD HAVE SENT HER ALOFT AGAIN BUT FOR THE HOLD SHE HAD OF HIS ARM PUT ME UP DIRECTLY PUT YOU UP WHERE YOU BEAUTY ASKED THE PRINCE HE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER ALMOST ALREADY
150-126107-0020 FOR HER ANGER MADE HER MORE CHARMING THAN ANY ONE ELSE HAD EVER BEHELD HER AND AS FAR AS HE COULD SEE WHICH CERTAINLY WAS NOT FAR SHE HAD NOT A SINGLE FAULT ABOUT HER EXCEPT OF COURSE THAT SHE HAD NOT ANY GRAVITY
150-126107-0021 NO PRINCE HOWEVER WOULD JUDGE OF A PRINCESS BY WEIGHT THE LOVELINESS OF HER FOOT HE WOULD HARDLY ESTIMATE BY THE DEPTH OF THE IMPRESSION IT COULD MAKE IN MUD PUT YOU UP WHERE YOU BEAUTY ASKED THE PRINCE IN THE WATER YOU STUPID
150-126107-0022 ANSWERED THE PRINCESS COME THEN SAID THE PRINCE THE CONDITION OF HER DRESS INCREASING HER USUAL DIFFICULTY IN WALKING COMPELLED HER TO CLING TO HIM AND HE COULD HARDLY PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS NOT IN A DELIGHTFUL DREAM
150-126107-0023 HE TURNED TOWARDS THE PRINCESS AND SAID HOW AM I TO PUT YOU IN THAT IS YOUR BUSINESS SHE ANSWERED QUITE SNAPPISHLY
150-126107-0024 VERY WELL SAID THE PRINCE AND CATCHING HER UP IN HIS ARMS HE SPRANG WITH HER FROM THE ROCK THE PRINCESS HAD JUST TIME TO GIVE ONE DELIGHTED SHRIEK OF LAUGHTER BEFORE THE WATER CLOSED OVER THEM
150-126107-0025 IT SEEMED TO ME LIKE GOING UP REJOINED SHE MY FEELING WAS CERTAINLY ONE OF ELEVATION TOO THE PRINCE CONCEDED THE PRINCESS DID NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND HIM FOR SHE RETORTED HIS QUESTION
150-126107-0026 SAID THE PRINCESS BEYOND EVERYTHING ANSWERED HE FOR I HAVE FALLEN IN WITH THE ONLY PERFECT CREATURE I EVER SAW NO MORE OF THAT I AM TIRED OF IT SAID THE PRINCESS PERHAPS SHE SHARED HER FATHER'S AVERSION TO PUNNING
150-126107-0027 DON'T YOU LIKE FALLING IN THEN SAID THE PRINCE IT IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL FUN I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE ANSWERED SHE I NEVER FELL BEFORE I WISH I COULD LEARN
150-126107-0028 TO THINK I AM THE ONLY PERSON IN MY FATHER'S KINGDOM THAT CAN'T FALL HERE THE POOR PRINCESS LOOKED ALMOST SAD I SHALL BE MOST HAPPY TO FALL IN WITH YOU ANY TIME YOU LIKE SAID THE PRINCE DEVOTEDLY THANK YOU
150-126107-0029 I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS IT WOULD NOT BE PROPER BUT I DON'T CARE AT ALL EVENTS AS WE HAVE FALLEN IN LET US HAVE A SWIM TOGETHER WITH ALL MY HEART RESPONDED THE PRINCE
150-126107-0030 AND AWAY THEY WENT SWIMMING AND DIVING AND FLOATING UNTIL AT LAST THEY HEARD CRIES ALONG THE SHORE AND SAW LIGHTS GLANCING IN ALL DIRECTIONS IT WAS NOW QUITE LATE AND THERE WAS NO MOON I MUST GO HOME SAID THE PRINCESS
150-126107-0031 AT LEAST I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHERE IT IS I WISH I HADN'T ONE EITHER REJOINED THE PRINCESS IT IS SO STUPID I HAVE A GREAT MIND SHE CONTINUED TO PLAY THEM ALL A TRICK WHY COULDN'T THEY LEAVE ME ALONE
150-126107-0032 THEY WON'T TRUST ME IN THE LAKE FOR A SINGLE NIGHT YOU SEE WHERE THAT GREEN LIGHT IS BURNING THAT IS THE WINDOW OF MY ROOM NOW IF YOU WOULD JUST SWIM THERE WITH ME VERY QUIETLY AND WHEN WE ARE ALL BUT UNDER THE BALCONY
150-126107-0033 AS YOU DID A LITTLE WHILE AGO I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CATCH HOLD OF THE BALCONY AND GET IN AT THE WINDOW AND THEN THEY MAY LOOK FOR ME TILL TO MORROW MORNING WITH MORE OBEDIENCE THAN PLEASURE SAID THE PRINCE GALLANTLY AND AWAY THEY SWAM VERY GENTLY
150-126107-0034 WILL YOU BE IN THE LAKE TO MORROW NIGHT THE PRINCE VENTURED TO ASK TO BE SURE I WILL I DON'T THINK SO PERHAPS WAS THE PRINCESS'S SOMEWHAT STRANGE ANSWER
150-126107-0035 AND MERELY WHISPERED AS HE GAVE HER THE PARTING LIFT DON'T TELL THE ONLY ANSWER THE PRINCESS RETURNED WAS A ROGUISH LOOK SHE WAS ALREADY A YARD ABOVE HIS HEAD THE LOOK SEEMED TO SAY NEVER FEAR IT IS TOO GOOD FUN TO SPOIL THAT WAY
150-126107-0036 SO PERFECTLY LIKE OTHER PEOPLE HAD SHE BEEN IN THE WATER THAT EVEN YET THE PRINCE COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE HIS EYES WHEN HE SAW HER ASCEND SLOWLY GRASP THE BALCONY AND DISAPPEAR THROUGH THE WINDOW
150-126107-0037 HE TURNED ALMOST EXPECTING TO SEE HER STILL BY HIS SIDE BUT HE WAS ALONE IN THE WATER SO HE SWAM AWAY QUIETLY AND WATCHED THE LIGHTS ROVING ABOUT THE SHORE FOR HOURS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS SAFE IN HER CHAMBER
150-126107-0038 AS SOON AS THEY DISAPPEARED HE LANDED IN SEARCH OF HIS TUNIC AND SWORD AND AFTER SOME TROUBLE FOUND THEM AGAIN THEN HE MADE THE BEST OF HIS WAY ROUND THE LAKE TO THE OTHER SIDE THERE THE WOOD WAS WILDER
150-126107-0039 AND THE SHORE STEEPER RISING MORE IMMEDIATELY TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS WHICH SURROUNDED THE LAKE ON ALL SIDES AND KEPT SENDING IT MESSAGES OF SILVERY STREAMS FROM MORNING TO NIGHT AND ALL NIGHT LONG HE SOON FOUND A SPOT WHENCE HE COULD SEE THE GREEN LIGHT IN THE PRINCESS'S ROOM
150-126107-0040 AND WHERE EVEN IN THE BROAD DAYLIGHT HE WOULD BE IN NO DANGER OF BEING DISCOVERED FROM THE OPPOSITE SHORE IT WAS A SORT OF CAVE IN THE ROCK WHERE HE PROVIDED HIMSELF A BED OF WITHERED LEAVES AND LAY DOWN TOO TIRED FOR HUNGER TO KEEP HIM AWAKE
150-126112-0000 THIS IS VERY KIND OF YOU THE PRINCE WENT TO DRESS FOR THE OCCASION FOR HE WAS RESOLVED TO DIE LIKE A PRINCE WHEN THE PRINCESS HEARD THAT A MAN HAD OFFERED TO DIE FOR HER
150-126112-0001 SHE WAS SO TRANSPORTED THAT SHE JUMPED OFF THE BED FEEBLE AS SHE WAS AND DANCED ABOUT THE ROOM FOR JOY SHE DID NOT CARE WHO THE MAN WAS THAT WAS NOTHING TO HER THE HOLE WANTED STOPPING AND IF ONLY A MAN WOULD DO WHY TAKE ONE
150-126112-0002 WHERE THEY HAD ALREADY PLACED A LITTLE BOAT FOR HER THE WATER WAS NOT DEEP ENOUGH TO FLOAT IT BUT THEY HOPED IT WOULD BE BEFORE LONG THEY LAID HER ON CUSHIONS PLACED IN THE BOAT WINES AND FRUITS AND OTHER NICE THINGS AND STRETCHED A CANOPY OVER ALL
150-126112-0003 IN A FEW MINUTES THE PRINCE APPEARED THE PRINCESS RECOGNIZED HIM AT ONCE BUT DID NOT THINK IT WORTH WHILE TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIM HERE I AM SAID THE PRINCE PUT ME IN
150-126112-0004 THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A SHOEBLACK SAID THE PRINCESS SO I AM SAID THE PRINCE I BLACKED YOUR LITTLE BOOTS THREE TIMES A DAY BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL I COULD GET OF YOU PUT ME IN
150-126112-0005 THE COURTIERS DID NOT RESENT HIS BLUNTNESS EXCEPT BY SAYING TO EACH OTHER THAT HE WAS TAKING IT OUT IN IMPUDENCE BUT HOW WAS HE TO BE PUT IN THE GOLDEN PLATE CONTAINED NO INSTRUCTIONS ON THIS POINT
150-126112-0006 THE PRINCE LOOKED AT THE HOLE AND SAW BUT ONE WAY HE PUT BOTH HIS LEGS INTO IT SITTING ON THE STONE AND STOOPING FORWARD COVERED THE CORNER THAT REMAINED OPEN WITH HIS TWO HANDS IN THIS UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION
150-126112-0007 HE RESOLVED TO ABIDE HIS FATE AND TURNING TO THE PEOPLE SAID NOW YOU CAN GO THE KING HAD ALREADY GONE HOME TO DINNER NOW YOU CAN GO REPEATED THE PRINCESS AFTER HIM LIKE A PARROT
150-126112-0008 THE PEOPLE OBEYED HER AND WENT PRESENTLY A LITTLE WAVE FLOWED OVER THE STONE AND WETTED ONE OF THE PRINCE'S KNEES BUT HE DID NOT MIND IT MUCH
150-126112-0009 AND A LONG PAUSE FOLLOWED THIS IS VERY KIND OF YOU PRINCE SAID THE PRINCESS AT LAST QUITE COOLLY AS SHE LAY IN THE BOAT WITH HER EYES SHUT I AM SORRY I CAN'T RETURN THE COMPLIMENT
150-126112-0010 THOUGHT THE PRINCE BUT YOU ARE WORTH DYING FOR AFTER ALL AGAIN A WAVELET AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER FLOWED OVER THE STONE AND WETTED BOTH THE PRINCE'S KNEES BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK OR MOVE
150-126112-0011 TWO THREE FOUR HOURS PASSED IN THIS WAY THE PRINCESS APPARENTLY ASLEEP AND THE PRINCE VERY PATIENT BUT HE WAS MUCH DISAPPOINTED IN HIS POSITION FOR HE HAD NONE OF THE CONSOLATION HE HAD HOPED FOR
150-126112-0012 AT LAST HE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER PRINCESS SAID HE BUT AT THE MOMENT UP STARTED THE PRINCESS CRYING I'M AFLOAT I'M AFLOAT AND THE LITTLE BOAT BUMPED AGAINST THE STONE PRINCESS
150-126112-0013 REPEATED THE PRINCE ENCOURAGED BY SEEING HER WIDE AWAKE AND LOOKING EAGERLY AT THE WATER WELL SAID SHE WITHOUT LOOKING ROUND
150-126112-0014 AND YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED AT ME ONCE DID HE THEN I SUPPOSE I MUST BUT I AM SO SLEEPY SLEEP THEN DARLING AND DON'T MIND ME SAID THE POOR PRINCE
150-126112-0015 REPLIED THE PRINCESS I THINK I WILL GO TO SLEEP AGAIN JUST GIVE ME A GLASS OF WINE AND A BISCUIT FIRST SAID THE PRINCE VERY HUMBLY WITH ALL MY HEART SAID THE PRINCESS AND GAPED AS SHE SAID IT
150-126112-0016 FEELING VERY FAINT INDEED ONLY I SHALL DIE BEFORE IT IS OF ANY USE TO YOU UNLESS I HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT THERE THEN SAID SHE HOLDING OUT THE WINE TO HIM AH YOU MUST FEED ME I DARE NOT MOVE MY HANDS
150-126112-0017 AND SHE BEGAN AT ONCE TO FEED HIM WITH BITS OF BISCUIT AND SIPS OF WINE AS SHE FED HIM HE CONTRIVED TO KISS THE TIPS OF HER FINGERS NOW AND THEN SHE DID NOT SEEM TO MIND IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BUT THE PRINCE FELT BETTER
150-126112-0018 NOW FOR YOUR OWN SAKE PRINCESS SAID HE I CANNOT LET YOU GO TO SLEEP YOU MUST SIT AND LOOK AT ME ELSE I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP UP WELL I WILL DO ANYTHING I CAN TO OBLIGE YOU
150-126112-0019 ANSWERED SHE WITH CONDESCENSION AND SITTING DOWN SHE DID LOOK AT HIM AND KEPT LOOKING AT HIM WITH WONDERFUL STEADINESS CONSIDERING ALL THINGS THE SUN WENT DOWN AND THE MOON ROSE
150-126112-0020 AND GUSH AFTER GUSH THE WATERS WERE RISING UP THE PRINCE'S BODY THEY WERE UP TO HIS WAIST NOW WHY CAN'T WE GO AND HAVE A SWIM SAID THE PRINCESS
150-126112-0021 I SHALL NEVER SWIM MORE SAID THE PRINCE OH I FORGOT SAID THE PRINCESS AND WAS SILENT SO THE WATER GREW AND GREW AND ROSE UP AND UP ON THE PRINCE
150-126112-0022 AND THE PRINCESS SAT AND LOOKED AT HIM SHE FED HIM NOW AND THEN THE NIGHT WORE ON THE WATERS ROSE AND ROSE THE MOON ROSE LIKEWISE HIGHER AND HIGHER
150-126112-0023 AND SHONE FULL ON THE FACE OF THE DYING PRINCE THE WATER WAS UP TO HIS NECK WILL YOU KISS ME PRINCESS SAID HE FEEBLY THE NONCHALANCE WAS ALL GONE NOW
150-126112-0024 YES I WILL ANSWERED THE PRINCESS AND KISSED HIM WITH A LONG SWEET COLD KISS NOW SAID HE WITH A SIGH OF CONTENT I DIE HAPPY
150-126112-0025 HE DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN THE PRINCESS GAVE HIM SOME WINE FOR THE LAST TIME HE WAS PAST EATING THEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND LOOKED AT HIM THE WATER ROSE AND ROSE
150-126112-0026 IT TOUCHED HIS CHIN IT TOUCHED HIS LOWER LIP IT TOUCHED BETWEEN HIS LIPS HE SHUT THEM HARD TO KEEP IT OUT THE PRINCESS BEGAN TO FEEL STRANGE IT TOUCHED HIS UPPER LIP
150-126112-0027 HE BREATHED THROUGH HIS NOSTRILS THE PRINCESS LOOKED WILD IT COVERED HIS NOSTRILS HER EYES LOOKED SCARED AND SHONE STRANGE IN THE MOONLIGHT HIS HEAD FELL BACK THE WATER CLOSED OVER IT
150-126112-0028 AND THE BUBBLES OF HIS LAST BREATH BUBBLED UP THROUGH THE WATER THE PRINCESS GAVE A SHRIEK AND SPRANG INTO THE LAKE SHE LAID HOLD FIRST OF ONE LEG AND THEN OF THE OTHER AND PULLED AND TUGGED BUT SHE COULD NOT MOVE EITHER SHE STOPPED TO TAKE BREATH
150-126112-0029 AND THAT MADE HER THINK THAT HE COULD NOT GET ANY BREATH SHE WAS FRANTIC SHE GOT HOLD OF HIM AND HELD HIS HEAD ABOVE THE WATER WHICH WAS POSSIBLE NOW HIS HANDS WERE NO LONGER ON THE HOLE BUT IT WAS OF NO USE FOR HE WAS PAST BREATHING
150-126112-0030 LOVE AND WATER BROUGHT BACK ALL HER STRENGTH SHE GOT UNDER THE WATER AND PULLED AND PULLED WITH HER WHOLE MIGHT TILL AT LAST SHE GOT ONE LEG OUT THE OTHER EASILY FOLLOWED HOW SHE GOT HIM INTO THE BOAT SHE NEVER COULD TELL
150-126112-0031 BUT WHEN SHE DID SHE FAINTED AWAY COMING TO HERSELF SHE SEIZED THE OARS KEPT HERSELF STEADY AS BEST SHE COULD AND ROWED AND ROWED THOUGH SHE HAD NEVER ROWED BEFORE ROUND ROCKS AND OVER SHALLOWS AND THROUGH MUD SHE ROWED
150-126112-0032 TILL SHE GOT TO THE LANDING STAIRS OF THE PALACE BY THIS TIME HER PEOPLE WERE ON THE SHORE FOR THEY HAD HEARD HER SHRIEK SHE MADE THEM CARRY THE PRINCE TO HER OWN ROOM AND LAY HIM IN HER BED AND LIGHT A FIRE AND SEND FOR THE DOCTORS
150-126112-0033 BUT THE LAKE YOUR HIGHNESS SAID THE CHAMBERLAIN WHO ROUSED BY THE NOISE CAME IN IN HIS NIGHTCAP GO AND DROWN YOURSELF IN IT SHE SAID THIS WAS THE LAST RUDENESS OF WHICH THE PRINCESS WAS EVER GUILTY
150-126112-0034 AND ONE MUST ALLOW THAT SHE HAD GOOD CAUSE TO FEEL PROVOKED WITH THE LORD CHAMBERLAIN HAD IT BEEN THE KING HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE FARED NO BETTER BUT BOTH HE AND THE QUEEN WERE FAST ASLEEP AND THE CHAMBERLAIN WENT BACK TO HIS BED
150-126112-0035 SOMEHOW THE DOCTORS NEVER CAME SO THE PRINCESS AND HER OLD NURSE WERE LEFT WITH THE PRINCE BUT THE OLD NURSE WAS A WISE WOMAN AND KNEW WHAT TO DO THEY TRIED EVERYTHING FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT SUCCESS
150-126112-0036 THE PRINCESS WAS NEARLY DISTRACTED BETWEEN HOPE AND FEAR BUT SHE TRIED ON AND ON ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER AND EVERYTHING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AT LAST WHEN THEY HAD ALL BUT GIVEN IT UP JUST AS THE SUN ROSE
150-132655-0000 BUT THE EXTREME IMPERTINENCE OF THE BARON DETERMINED HIM TO CONCLUDE THE MATCH
150-132655-0001 CACAMBO DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO DELIVER HIM UP AGAIN TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE GALLEY AFTER WHICH THEY THOUGHT TO SEND HIM BACK TO THE GENERAL FATHER OF THE ORDER AT ROME BY THE FIRST SHIP THIS ADVICE WAS WELL RECEIVED THE OLD WOMAN APPROVED IT
150-132655-0002 THEY SAID NOT A WORD TO HIS SISTER THE THING WAS EXECUTED FOR A LITTLE MONEY AND THEY HAD THE DOUBLE PLEASURE OF ENTRAPPING A JESUIT AND PUNISHING THE PRIDE OF A GERMAN BARON
150-132655-0003 IT IS NATURAL TO IMAGINE THAT AFTER SO MANY DISASTERS CANDIDE MARRIED AND LIVING WITH THE PHILOSOPHER PANGLOSS THE PHILOSOPHER MARTIN THE PRUDENT CACAMBO AND THE OLD WOMAN
150-132655-0004 HAVING BESIDES BROUGHT SO MANY DIAMONDS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE ANCIENT INCAS MUST HAVE LED A VERY HAPPY LIFE BUT HE WAS SO MUCH IMPOSED UPON BY THE JEWS THAT HE HAD NOTHING LEFT EXCEPT HIS SMALL FARM
150-132655-0005 HIS WIFE BECAME UGLIER EVERY DAY MORE PEEVISH AND UNSUPPORTABLE THE OLD WOMAN WAS INFIRM AND EVEN MORE FRETFUL THAN CUNEGONDE CACAMBO WHO WORKED IN THE GARDEN AND TOOK VEGETABLES FOR SALE TO CONSTANTINOPLE
150-132655-0006 AND THEY SAW OTHER CADIS PASHAS AND EFFENDIS COMING TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF THE EXILES AND AFTERWARDS EXILED IN THEIR TURN THEY SAW HEADS DECENTLY IMPALED FOR PRESENTATION TO THE SUBLIME PORTE
150-132655-0007 I WANT TO KNOW WHICH IS WORSE TO BE RAVISHED A HUNDRED TIMES BY NEGRO PIRATES
150-132655-0008 IN SHORT TO GO THROUGH ALL THE MISERIES WE HAVE UNDERGONE OR TO STAY HERE AND HAVE NOTHING TO DO
150-132655-0009 THIS DISCOURSE GAVE RISE TO NEW REFLECTIONS AND MARTIN ESPECIALLY CONCLUDED THAT MAN WAS BORN TO LIVE EITHER IN A STATE OF DISTRACTING INQUIETUDE OR OF LETHARGIC DISGUST
150-132655-0010 PANGLOSS OWNED THAT HE HAD ALWAYS SUFFERED HORRIBLY BUT AS HE HAD ONCE ASSERTED THAT EVERYTHING WENT WONDERFULLY WELL HE ASSERTED IT STILL THOUGH HE NO LONGER BELIEVED IT WHAT HELPED TO CONFIRM MARTIN IN HIS DETESTABLE PRINCIPLES
150-132655-0011 THEY HAD SOON SQUANDERED THEIR THREE THOUSAND PIASTRES PARTED WERE RECONCILED QUARRELLED AGAIN
150-132655-0012 THAT YOUR PRESENTS WOULD SOON BE DISSIPATED AND ONLY MAKE THEM THE MORE MISERABLE YOU HAVE ROLLED IN MILLIONS OF MONEY YOU AND CACAMBO
150-132655-0013 HA SAID PANGLOSS TO PAQUETTE PROVIDENCE HAS THEN BROUGHT YOU AMONGST US AGAIN MY POOR CHILD DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU COST ME THE TIP OF MY NOSE AN EYE AND AN EAR AS YOU MAY SEE WHAT A WORLD IS THIS
150-132655-0014 AND NOW THIS NEW ADVENTURE SET THEM PHILOSOPHISING MORE THAN EVER IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THERE LIVED A VERY FAMOUS DERVISH WHO WAS ESTEEMED THE BEST PHILOSOPHER IN ALL TURKEY AND THEY WENT TO CONSULT HIM PANGLOSS WAS THE SPEAKER
150-132655-0015 MASTER SAID HE WE COME TO BEG YOU TO TELL WHY SO STRANGE AN ANIMAL AS MAN WAS MADE WITH WHAT MEDDLEST THOU SAID THE DERVISH IS IT THY BUSINESS
150-132655-0016 THERE IS HORRIBLE EVIL IN THIS WORLD WHAT SIGNIFIES IT SAID THE DERVISH WHETHER THERE BE EVIL OR GOOD WHEN HIS HIGHNESS SENDS A SHIP TO EGYPT DOES HE TROUBLE HIS HEAD WHETHER THE MICE ON BOARD ARE AT THEIR EASE OR NOT
150-132655-0017 WHAT THEN MUST WE DO SAID PANGLOSS HOLD YOUR TONGUE ANSWERED THE DERVISH I WAS IN HOPES SAID PANGLOSS THAT I SHOULD REASON WITH YOU A LITTLE ABOUT CAUSES AND EFFECTS ABOUT THE BEST OF POSSIBLE WORLDS THE ORIGIN OF EVIL THE NATURE OF THE SOUL
150-132655-0018 AND THE PRE ESTABLISHED HARMONY AT THESE WORDS THE DERVISH SHUT THE DOOR IN THEIR FACES DURING THIS CONVERSATION THE NEWS WAS SPREAD THAT TWO VIZIERS AND THE MUFTI HAD BEEN STRANGLED AT CONSTANTINOPLE AND THAT SEVERAL OF THEIR FRIENDS HAD BEEN IMPALED
150-132655-0019 ASKED THE OLD MAN WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE STRANGLED MUFTI I DO NOT KNOW ANSWERED THE WORTHY MAN AND I HAVE NOT KNOWN THE NAME OF ANY MUFTI NOR OF ANY VIZIER I AM ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE EVENT YOU MENTION
150-132655-0020 I PRESUME IN GENERAL THAT THEY WHO MEDDLE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS DIE SOMETIMES MISERABLY AND THAT THEY DESERVE IT BUT I NEVER TROUBLE MY HEAD ABOUT WHAT IS TRANSACTING AT CONSTANTINOPLE
150-132655-0021 I CONTENT MYSELF WITH SENDING THERE FOR SALE THE FRUITS OF THE GARDEN WHICH I CULTIVATE HAVING SAID THESE WORDS HE INVITED THE STRANGERS INTO HIS HOUSE HIS TWO SONS AND TWO DAUGHTERS PRESENTED THEM WITH SEVERAL SORTS OF SHERBET WHICH THEY MADE THEMSELVES
150-132655-0022 WITH KAIMAK ENRICHED WITH THE CANDIED PEEL OF CITRONS WITH ORANGES LEMONS PINE APPLES PISTACHIO NUTS AND MOCHA COFFEE UNADULTERATED WITH THE BAD COFFEE OF BATAVIA OR THE AMERICAN ISLANDS
150-132655-0023 YOU MUST HAVE A VAST AND MAGNIFICENT ESTATE SAID CANDIDE TO THE TURK I HAVE ONLY TWENTY ACRES REPLIED THE OLD MAN I AND MY CHILDREN CULTIVATE THEM OUR LABOUR PRESERVES US FROM THREE GREAT EVILS WEARINESS VICE AND WANT
150-132655-0024 MADE PROFOUND REFLECTIONS ON THE OLD MAN'S CONVERSATION THIS HONEST TURK SAID HE TO PANGLOSS AND MARTIN SEEMS TO BE IN A SITUATION FAR PREFERABLE TO THAT OF THE SIX KINGS WITH WHOM WE HAD THE HONOUR OF SUPPING
150-132655-0025 GRANDEUR SAID PANGLOSS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY OF PHILOSOPHERS FOR IN SHORT EGLON KING OF MOAB WAS ASSASSINATED BY EHUD ABSALOM WAS HUNG BY HIS HAIR AND PIERCED WITH THREE DARTS
150-132655-0026 KING NADAB THE SON OF JEROBOAM WAS KILLED BY BAASA
150-132655-0027 ATHALIAH BY JEHOIADA THE KINGS JEHOIAKIM JECONIAH AND ZEDEKIAH WERE LED INTO CAPTIVITY
150-132655-0028 DIONYSIUS OF SYRACUSE PYRRHUS PERSEUS HANNIBAL JUGURTHA ARIOVISTUS CAESAR POMPEY NERO OTHO VITELLIUS DOMITIAN
150-132655-0029 THAT WE MUST CULTIVATE OUR GARDEN YOU ARE RIGHT SAID PANGLOSS FOR WHEN MAN WAS FIRST PLACED IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN HE WAS PUT THERE UT OPERARETUR EUM THAT HE MIGHT CULTIVATE IT WHICH SHOWS THAT MAN WAS NOT BORN TO BE IDLE
150-132655-0030 LET US WORK SAID MARTIN WITHOUT DISPUTING IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO RENDER LIFE TOLERABLE THE WHOLE LITTLE SOCIETY ENTERED INTO THIS LAUDABLE DESIGN ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT ABILITIES THEIR LITTLE PLOT OF LAND PRODUCED PLENTIFUL CROPS
150-132655-0031 BUT SHE BECAME AN EXCELLENT PASTRY COOK
150-132655-0032 THE OLD WOMAN LOOKED AFTER THE LINEN
150-132655-0033 FOR HE MADE A GOOD JOINER AND BECAME A VERY HONEST MAN
150-132655-0034 THERE IS A CONCATENATION OF EVENTS IN THIS BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS
150-132655-0035 IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN PUT INTO THE INQUISITION IF YOU HAD NOT WALKED OVER AMERICA IF YOU HAD NOT STABBED THE BARON IF YOU HAD NOT LOST ALL YOUR SHEEP FROM THE FINE COUNTRY OF EL DORADO YOU WOULD NOT BE HERE EATING PRESERVED CITRONS AND PISTACHIO NUTS
1502-122615-0000 POPE'S ILIAD A SINGLE MOMENT SERVED TO CONVINCE THE YOUTH THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN A HAND WAS LAID WITH A POWERFUL PRESSURE ON HIS ARM AND THE LOW VOICE OF UNCAS MUTTERED IN HIS EAR THE HURONS ARE DOGS
1502-122615-0001 THE SIGHT OF A COWARD'S BLOOD CAN NEVER MAKE A WARRIOR TREMBLE THE GRAY HEAD AND THE SAGAMORE ARE SAFE
1502-122615-0002 GO UNCAS AND THE OPEN HAND ARE NOW STRANGERS IT IS ENOUGH
1502-122615-0003 BUT A GENTLE PUSH FROM HIS FRIEND URGED HIM TOWARD THE DOOR AND ADMONISHED HIM OF THE DANGER THAT MIGHT ATTEND THE DISCOVERY OF THEIR INTERCOURSE SLOWLY AND RELUCTANTLY YIELDING TO THE NECESSITY HE QUITTED THE PLACE AND MINGLED WITH THE THRONG THAT HOVERED NIGH
1502-122615-0004 THE DYING FIRES IN THE CLEARING CAST A DIM AND UNCERTAIN LIGHT ON THE DUSKY FIGURES THAT WERE SILENTLY STALKING TO AND FRO AND OCCASIONALLY A BRIGHTER GLEAM THAN COMMON GLANCED INTO THE LODGE AND EXHIBITED THE FIGURE OF UNCAS
1502-122615-0005 AFTER THIS TERMINATION OF THE SCENE DUNCAN WANDERED AMONG THE LODGES UNQUESTIONED AND UNNOTICED ENDEAVORING TO FIND SOME TRACE OF HER IN WHOSE BEHALF HE INCURRED THE RISK HE RAN
1502-122615-0006 HE RETRACED HIS STEPS TO THE COUNCIL LODGE RESOLVED TO SEEK AND QUESTION DAVID IN ORDER TO PUT AN END TO HIS DOUBTS ON REACHING THE BUILDING WHICH HAD PROVED ALIKE THE SEAT OF JUDGMENT AND THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
1502-122615-0007 THOUGH THE RETURN OF DUNCAN WAS LIKELY TO REMIND THEM OF HIS CHARACTER AND THE SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS VISIT IT PRODUCED NO VISIBLE SENSATION SO FAR THE TERRIBLE SCENE THAT HAD JUST OCCURRED
1502-122615-0008 PROVED FAVORABLE TO HIS VIEWS AND HE REQUIRED NO OTHER PROMPTER THAN HIS OWN FEELINGS TO CONVINCE HIM OF THE EXPEDIENCY OF PROFITING BY SO UNEXPECTED AN ADVANTAGE WITHOUT SEEMING TO HESITATE
1502-122615-0009 HE WALKED INTO THE LODGE AND TOOK HIS SEAT WITH A GRAVITY THAT ACCORDED ADMIRABLY WITH THE DEPORTMENT OF HIS HOSTS A HASTY BUT SEARCHING GLANCE SUFFICED TO TELL HIM THAT THOUGH UNCAS STILL REMAINED WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIM
1502-122615-0010 DAVID HAD NOT REAPPEARED NO OTHER RESTRAINT WAS IMPOSED ON THE FORMER THAN THE WATCHFUL LOOKS OF A YOUNG HURON WHO HAD PLACED HIMSELF AT HAND THOUGH AN ARMED WARRIOR LEANED AGAINST THE POST THAT FORMED ONE SIDE OF THE NARROW DOORWAY
1502-122615-0011 IN EVERY OTHER RESPECT THE CAPTIVE SEEMED AT LIBERTY STILL HE WAS EXCLUDED FROM ALL PARTICIPATION IN THE DISCOURSE AND POSSESSED MUCH MORE OF THE AIR OF SOME FINELY MOLDED STATUE THAN A MAN HAVING LIFE AND VOLITION
1502-122615-0012 HE WOULD GREATLY HAVE PREFERRED SILENCE AND MEDITATION TO SPEECH WHEN A DISCOVERY OF HIS REAL CONDITION MIGHT PROVE SO INSTANTLY FATAL UNFORTUNATELY FOR THIS PRUDENT RESOLUTION HIS ENTERTAINERS APPEARED OTHERWISE DISPOSED
1502-122615-0013 HE HAD NOT LONG OCCUPIED THE SEAT WISELY TAKEN A LITTLE IN THE SHADE WHEN ANOTHER OF THE ELDER WARRIORS WHO SPOKE THE FRENCH LANGUAGE ADDRESSED HIM MY CANADA FATHER DOES NOT FORGET HIS CHILDREN SAID THE CHIEF
1502-122615-0014 I THANK HIM AN EVIL SPIRIT LIVES IN THE WIFE OF ONE OF MY YOUNG MEN CAN THE CUNNING STRANGER FRIGHTEN HIM AWAY HEYWARD POSSESSED SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THE MUMMERY PRACTISED AMONG THE INDIANS
1502-122615-0015 IN THE CASES OF SUCH SUPPOSED VISITATIONS HE SAW AT A GLANCE THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE MIGHT POSSIBLY BE IMPROVED TO FURTHER HIS OWN ENDS IT WOULD THEREFORE HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT JUST THEN TO HAVE UTTERED A PROPOSAL
1502-122615-0016 THAT WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM MORE SATISFACTION AWARE OF THE NECESSITY OF PRESERVING THE DIGNITY OF HIS IMAGINARY CHARACTER HOWEVER HE REPRESSED HIS FEELINGS AND ANSWERED WITH SUITABLE MYSTERY SPIRITS DIFFER
1502-122615-0017 THE HURON WAS CONTENT WITH THE ASSURANCE AND RESUMING HIS PIPE HE AWAITED THE PROPER MOMENT TO MOVE THE IMPATIENT HEYWARD INWARDLY EXECRATING THE COLD CUSTOMS OF THE SAVAGES
1502-122615-0018 EQUAL TO THAT MAINTAINED BY THE CHIEF WHO WAS IN TRUTH A NEAR RELATIVE OF THE AFFLICTED WOMAN THE MINUTES LINGERED AND THE DELAY HAD SEEMED AN HOUR TO THE ADVENTURER IN EMPIRICISM WHEN THE HURON LAID ASIDE HIS PIPE
1502-122615-0019 AND DREW HIS ROBE ACROSS HIS BREAST AS IF ABOUT TO LEAD THE WAY TO THE LODGE OF THE INVALID JUST THEN A WARRIOR OF POWERFUL FRAME DARKENED THE DOOR AND STALKING SILENTLY AMONG THE ATTENTIVE GROUP
1502-122615-0020 HE SEATED HIMSELF ON ONE END OF THE LOW PILE OF BRUSH WHICH SUSTAINED DUNCAN THE LATTER CAST AN IMPATIENT LOOK AT HIS NEIGHBOR AND FELT HIS FLESH CREEP WITH UNCONTROLLABLE HORROR WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF IN ACTUAL CONTACT WITH MAGUA
1502-122615-0021 SEVERAL PIPES THAT HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED WERE LIGHTED AGAIN
1502-122615-0022 DREW HIS TOMAHAWK FROM HIS GIRDLE AND FILLING THE BOWL ON ITS HEAD BEGAN TO INHALE THE VAPORS OF THE WEED THROUGH THE HOLLOW HANDLE
1502-122615-0023 TEN MINUTES WHICH APPEARED SO MANY AGES TO DUNCAN MIGHT HAVE PASSED IN THIS MANNER AND THE WARRIORS WERE FAIRLY ENVELOPED IN A CLOUD OF WHITE SMOKE BEFORE ANY OF THEM SPOKE
1502-122615-0024 HAS MY FRIEND FOUND THE MOOSE THE YOUNG MEN STAGGER UNDER THEIR BURDENS RETURNED MAGUA LET REED THAT BENDS GO ON THE HUNTING PATH HE WILL MEET THEM A DEEP AND AWFUL SILENCE SUCCEEDED THE UTTERANCE OF THE FORBIDDEN NAME
1502-122615-0025 AS THOUGH ALL HAD INHALED AN IMPURITY AT THE SAME INSTANT THE SMOKE WREATHED ABOVE THEIR HEADS IN LITTLE EDDIES
1502-122615-0026 LEAVING THE PLACE BENEATH CLEAR OF ITS FUMES
1502-122615-0027 THE LOOKS OF MOST OF THE WARRIORS WERE RIVETED ON THE EARTH
1502-122615-0028 SUFFERED THEIR WILD AND GLARING EYEBALLS TO ROLL IN THE DIRECTION OF A WHITE HEADED SAVAGE
1502-122615-0029 LIKE MOST AROUND HIM FOR MORE THAN A MINUTE HIS LOOK TOO WAS ON THE GROUND BUT TRUSTING HIS EYES AT LENGTH TO STEAL A GLANCE ASIDE HE PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS BECOMING AN OBJECT OF GENERAL ATTENTION
1502-122615-0030 THEN HE AROSE AND LIFTED HIS VOICE IN THE GENERAL SILENCE IT WAS A LIE HE SAID I HAD NO SON HE WHO WAS CALLED BY THAT NAME IS FORGOTTEN
1502-122615-0031 THE WICKED CHIPPEWAS CHEATED MY SQUAW
1502-122615-0032 HE IS HAPPY WHO KNOWS THAT THE EVIL OF HIS RACE DIES WITH HIMSELF I HAVE DONE THE SPEAKER WHO WAS THE FATHER OF THE RECREANT YOUNG INDIAN LOOKED ROUND AND ABOUT HIM
1502-122615-0033 THE EXPRESSION OF HIS EYE CONTRADICTED HIS FIGURATIVE AND BOASTFUL LANGUAGE
1502-122615-0034 STANDING A SINGLE MINUTE TO ENJOY HIS BITTER TRIUMPH HE TURNED AWAY AS IF SICKENING AT THE GAZE OF MEN AND VEILING HIS FACE IN HIS BLANKET HE WALKED FROM THE LODGE WITH THE NOISELESS STEP OF AN INDIAN SEEKING
1502-122615-0035 IN THE PRIVACY OF HIS OWN ABODE THE SYMPATHY OF ONE LIKE HIMSELF AGED FORLORN AND CHILDLESS THE INDIANS WHO BELIEVE IN THE HEREDITARY TRANSMISSION OF VIRTUES AND DEFECTS IN CHARACTER
1502-122615-0036 SUFFERED HIM TO DEPART IN SILENCE THEN WITH AN ELEVATION OF BREEDING THAT MANY IN A MORE CULTIVATED STATE OF SOCIETY MIGHT PROFITABLY EMULATE ONE OF THE CHIEFS DREW THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG MEN
1502-122615-0037 BUT WHO HAS EVER FOUND A HURON ASLEEP THE DARKNESS OF THE IMPENDING CLOUD WHICH PRECEDES A BURST OF THUNDER WAS NOT BLACKER THAN THE BROW OF MAGUA AS HE EXCLAIMED THE DELAWARES OF THE LAKES
1502-122615-0038 NOT SO THEY WHO WEAR THE PETTICOATS OF SQUAWS ON THEIR OWN RIVER ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN PASSING THE TRIBE DID MY YOUNG MEN TAKE HIS SCALP
1502-122619-0000 BRIEF I PRAY FOR YOU FOR YOU SEE TIS A BUSY TIME WITH ME MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING THE TRIBE OR RATHER HALF TRIBE OF DELAWARES
1502-122619-0001 COULD ASSEMBLE ABOUT AN EQUAL NUMBER OF WARRIORS WITH THE LATTER PEOPLE LIKE THEIR NEIGHBORS THEY HAD FOLLOWED MONTCALM INTO THE TERRITORIES OF THE ENGLISH CROWN AND WERE MAKING HEAVY AND SERIOUS INROADS ON THE HUNTING GROUNDS OF THE MOHAWKS
1502-122619-0002 THOUGH THEY HAD SEEN FIT WITH THE MYSTERIOUS RESERVE SO COMMON AMONG THE NATIVES TO WITHHOLD THEIR ASSISTANCE AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT WAS MOST REQUIRED THE FRENCH HAD ACCOUNTED FOR THIS UNEXPECTED DEFECTION ON THE PART OF THEIR ALLY
1502-122619-0003 IN VARIOUS WAYS IT WAS THE PREVALENT OPINION HOWEVER
1502-122619-0004 THAT HAD ONCE MADE THEM DEPENDENT ON THE SIX NATIONS FOR MILITARY PROTECTION AND NOW RENDERED THEM RELUCTANT TO ENCOUNTER THEIR FORMER MASTERS AS FOR THE TRIBE ITSELF IT HAD BEEN CONTENT TO ANNOUNCE TO MONTCALM THROUGH HIS EMISSARIES WITH INDIAN BREVITY
1502-122619-0005 THAT THEIR HATCHETS WERE DULL AND TIME WAS NECESSARY TO SHARPEN THEM THE POLITIC CAPTAIN OF THE CANADAS HAD DEEMED IT WISER TO SUBMIT TO ENTERTAIN A PASSIVE FRIEND THAN BY ANY ACTS OF ILL JUDGED SEVERITY TO CONVERT HIM INTO AN OPEN ENEMY
1502-122619-0006 ON THAT MORNING WHEN MAGUA LED HIS SILENT PARTY FROM THE SETTLEMENT OF THE BEAVERS INTO THE FORESTS IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED THE SUN ROSE UPON THE DELAWARE ENCAMPMENT AS IF IT HAD SUDDENLY BURST UPON A BUSY PEOPLE
1502-122619-0007 THE WOMEN RAN FROM LODGE TO LODGE
1502-122619-0008 A FEW EARNESTLY BENT ON SEEKING THE COMFORTS NECESSARY TO THEIR HABITS BUT MORE PAUSING TO EXCHANGE HASTY AND WHISPERED SENTENCES WITH THEIR FRIENDS THE WARRIORS WERE LOUNGING IN GROUPS
1502-122619-0009 THE INSTRUMENTS OF THE CHASE WERE TO BE SEEN IN ABUNDANCE AMONG THE LODGES BUT NONE DEPARTED HERE AND THERE A WARRIOR WAS EXAMINING HIS ARMS WITH AN ATTENTION THAT IS RARELY BESTOWED ON THE IMPLEMENTS
1502-122619-0010 WHEN NO OTHER ENEMY THAN THE BEASTS OF THE FOREST IS EXPECTED TO BE ENCOUNTERED AND OCCASIONALLY THE EYES OF A WHOLE GROUP WERE TURNED SIMULTANEOUSLY
1502-122619-0011 AS IF IT CONTAINED THE SUBJECT OF THEIR COMMON THOUGHTS DURING THE EXISTENCE OF THIS SCENE A MAN SUDDENLY APPEARED AT THE FURTHEST EXTREMITY OF A PLATFORM OF ROCK WHICH FORMED THE LEVEL OF THE VILLAGE
1502-122619-0012 HE WAS WITHOUT ARMS AND HIS PAINT TENDED RATHER TO SOFTEN THAN INCREASE THE NATURAL STERNNESS OF HIS AUSTERE COUNTENANCE WHEN IN FULL VIEW OF THE DELAWARES HE STOPPED AND MADE A GESTURE OF AMITY
1502-122619-0013 BY THROWING HIS ARM UPWARD TOWARD HEAVEN AND THEN LETTING IT FALL IMPRESSIVELY ON HIS BREAST
1502-122619-0014 FORTIFIED BY THESE ASSURANCES THE DARK FIGURE LEFT THE BROW OF THE NATURAL ROCKY TERRACE
1502-122619-0015 HE MADE AS HE ADVANCED MANY COURTEOUS SIGNS OF GREETING TO THE MEN HE PASSED NEGLECTING TO NOTICE THE WOMEN HOWEVER LIKE ONE WHO DEEMED THEIR FAVOR IN THE PRESENT ENTERPRISE OF NO IMPORTANCE
1502-122619-0016 HIS RECEPTION WAS GRAVE SILENT AND WARY THE WARRIORS IN FRONT STEPPED ASIDE OPENING THE WAY TO THEIR MOST APPROVED ORATOR BY THE ACTION
1502-122619-0017 ONE WHO SPOKE ALL THOSE LANGUAGES THAT WERE CULTIVATED AMONG THE NORTHERN ABORIGINES THE WISE HURON IS WELCOME SAID THE DELAWARE
1502-122619-0018 COMPOSED OF CRACKED CORN AND BEANS IT IS MUCH USED ALSO BY THE WHITES BY CORN IS MEANT MAISE
1502-122619-0019 HE IS COME REPEATED MAGUA BENDING HIS HEAD WITH THE DIGNITY OF AN EASTERN PRINCE THE CHIEF EXTENDED HIS ARM AND TAKING THE OTHER BY THE WRIST THEY ONCE MORE EXCHANGED FRIENDLY SALUTATIONS
1502-122619-0020 THEN THE DELAWARE INVITED HIS GUEST TO ENTER HIS OWN LODGE AND SHARE HIS MORNING MEAL THE INVITATION WAS ACCEPTED AND THE TWO WARRIORS ATTENDED BY THREE OR FOUR OF THE OLD MEN WALKED CALMLY AWAY
1502-122619-0021 LEAVING THE REST OF THE TRIBE DEVOURED BY A DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND THE REASONS OF SO UNUSUAL A VISIT AND YET NOT BETRAYING THE LEAST IMPATIENCE BY SIGN OR WORD DURING THE SHORT AND FRUGAL REPAST THAT FOLLOWED
1502-122619-0022 AND RELATED ENTIRELY TO THE EVENTS OF THE HUNT IN WHICH MAGUA HAD SO LATELY BEEN ENGAGED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE MOST FINISHED BREEDING TO WEAR MORE OF THE APPEARANCE OF CONSIDERING THE VISIT AS A THING OF COURSE THAN DID HIS HOSTS
1502-122619-0023 NOTWITHSTANDING EVERY INDIVIDUAL PRESENT WAS PERFECTLY AWARE
1502-122619-0024 IS THE FACE OF MY GREAT CANADA FATHER TURNED AGAIN TOWARD HIS HURON CHILDREN
1502-122619-0025 WHEN WAS IT EVER OTHERWISE RETURNED MAGUA HE CALLS MY PEOPLE MOST BELOVED THE DELAWARE GRAVELY BOWED HIS ACQUIESCENCE TO WHAT HE KNEW TO BE FALSE AND CONTINUED
1502-122619-0026 THE TOMAHAWKS OF YOUR YOUNG MEN HAVE BEEN VERY RED IT IS SO BUT THEY ARE NOW BRIGHT AND DULL FOR THE YENGEESE ARE DEAD AND THE DELAWARES ARE OUR NEIGHBORS
1502-122619-0027 THE OTHER ACKNOWLEDGED THE PACIFIC COMPLIMENT BY A GESTURE OF THE HAND AND REMAINED SILENT THEN MAGUA AS IF RECALLED TO SUCH A RECOLLECTION BY THE ALLUSION TO THE MASSACRE DEMANDED
1502-122619-0028 DOES MY PRISONER GIVE TROUBLE TO MY BROTHERS SHE IS WELCOME THE PATH BETWEEN THE HURONS AND THE DELAWARES IS SHORT AND IT IS OPEN LET HER BE SENT TO MY SQUAWS IF SHE GIVES TROUBLE TO MY BROTHER
1502-122619-0029 SHE IS WELCOME RETURNED THE CHIEF OF THE LATTER NATION STILL MORE EMPHATICALLY THE BAFFLED MAGUA CONTINUED SILENT SEVERAL MINUTES APPARENTLY INDIFFERENT HOWEVER TO THE REPULSE HE HAD RECEIVED
1502-122619-0030 IN THIS HIS OPENING EFFORT TO REGAIN POSSESSION OF CORA DO MY YOUNG MEN LEAVE THE DELAWARES ROOM ON THE MOUNTAINS FOR THEIR HUNTS HE AT LENGTH CONTINUED
1502-122619-0031 IT IS WELL JUSTICE IS THE MASTER OF A RED SKIN WHY SHOULD THEY BRIGHTEN THEIR TOMAHAWKS AND SHARPEN THEIR KNIVES AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE NOT THE PALE FACES THICKER THAN THE SWALLOWS IN THE SEASON OF FLOWERS
1502-122619-0032 GOOD EXCLAIMED TWO OR THREE OF HIS AUDITORS AT THE SAME TIME
1502-122619-0033 TO PERMIT HIS WORDS TO SOFTEN THE FEELINGS OF THE DELAWARES BEFORE HE ADDED HAVE THERE NOT BEEN STRANGE MOCCASINS IN THE WOODS HAVE NOT MY BROTHERS SCENTED THE FEET OF WHITE MEN
1502-122619-0034 LET MY CANADA FATHER COME RETURNED THE OTHER EVASIVELY HIS CHILDREN ARE READY TO SEE HIM WHEN THE GREAT CHIEF COMES IT IS TO SMOKE WITH THE INDIANS IN THEIR WIGWAMS THE HURONS SAY TOO HE IS WELCOME
1502-122619-0035 BUT THE YENGEESE HAVE LONG ARMS AND LEGS THAT NEVER TIRE
1502-122619-0036 IT IS WELL THE WARRIOR WHOSE EYE IS OPEN CAN SEE HIS ENEMY SAID MAGUA ONCE MORE SHIFTING HIS GROUND
1502-122619-0037 AND GRAVELY SPREAD HIS PRESENTS BEFORE THE DAZZLED EYES OF HIS HOSTS THEY CONSISTED PRINCIPALLY OF TRINKETS OF LITTLE VALUE PLUNDERED FROM THE SLAUGHTERED FEMALES OF WILLIAM HENRY
1502-122619-0038 IN THE DIVISION OF THE BAUBLES THE CUNNING HURON DISCOVERED NO LESS ART THAN IN THEIR SELECTION WHILE HE BESTOWED THOSE OF GREATER VALUE ON THE TWO MOST DISTINGUISHED WARRIORS ONE OF WHOM WAS HIS HOST HE SEASONED HIS OFFERINGS TO THEIR INFERIORS
1502-122619-0039 COMPLIMENTS AS LEFT THEM NO GROUND OF COMPLAINT IN SHORT THE WHOLE CEREMONY CONTAINED SUCH A HAPPY BLENDING OF THE PROFITABLE WITH THE FLATTERING THAT IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR THE DONOR IMMEDIATELY TO READ THE EFFECT OF A GENEROSITY
1502-122619-0040 SO APTLY MINGLED WITH PRAISE IN THE EYES OF THOSE HE ADDRESSED THIS WELL JUDGED AND POLITIC STROKE ON THE PART OF MAGUA WAS NOT WITHOUT INSTANTANEOUS RESULTS
1502-122619-0041 MY BROTHER IS A WISE CHIEF HE IS WELCOME THE HURONS LOVE THEIR FRIENDS THE DELAWARES RETURNED MAGUA WHY SHOULD THEY NOT THEY ARE COLORED BY THE SAME SUN AND THEIR JUST MEN WILL HUNT IN THE SAME GROUNDS AFTER DEATH
1502-122619-0042 THE RED SKINS SHOULD BE FRIENDS AND LOOK WITH OPEN EYES ON THE WHITE MEN HAS NOT MY BROTHER SCENTED SPIES IN THE WOODS THE DELAWARE WHOSE NAME IN ENGLISH SIGNIFIED HARD HEART
1502-122619-0043 AN APPELLATION THAT THE FRENCH HAD TRANSLATED INTO LE COEUR DUR FORGOT THAT OBDURACY OF PURPOSE
1502-122619-0044 WOULD THE YENGEESE SEND THEIR WOMEN AS SPIES DID NOT THE HURON CHIEF SAY HE TOOK WOMEN IN THE BATTLE HE TOLD NO LIE THE YENGEESE HAVE SENT OUT THEIR SCOUTS
1502-122619-0045 THEN THEY FLED TO THE DELAWARES FOR SAY THEY THE DELAWARES ARE OUR FRIENDS THEIR MINDS ARE TURNED FROM THEIR CANADA FATHER THIS INSINUATION WAS A HOME THRUST
1502-122619-0046 WOULD HAVE ENTITLED MAGUA TO THE REPUTATION OF A SKILLFUL DIPLOMATIST THE RECENT DEFECTION OF THE TRIBE HAD AS THEY WELL KNEW THEMSELVES SUBJECTED THE DELAWARES TO MUCH REPROACH AMONG THEIR FRENCH ALLIES
1502-122619-0047 AND THEY WERE NOW MADE TO FEEL THAT THEIR FUTURE ACTIONS WERE TO BE REGARDED WITH JEALOUSY AND DISTRUST THERE WAS NO DEEP INSIGHT INTO CAUSES AND EFFECTS NECESSARY TO FORESEE
1502-122619-0048 THAT SUCH A SITUATION OF THINGS WAS LIKELY TO PROVE HIGHLY PREJUDICIAL TO THEIR FUTURE MOVEMENTS THEIR DISTANT VILLAGES THEIR HUNTING GROUNDS
1502-122619-0049 TOGETHER WITH A MATERIAL PART OF THEIR PHYSICAL FORCE WERE ACTUALLY WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE FRENCH TERRITORY ACCORDINGLY THIS ALARMING ANNUNCIATION WAS RECEIVED AS MAGUA INTENDED
1502-122619-0050 WITH MANIFEST DISAPPROBATION IF NOT WITH ALARM
1502-122619-0051 HE WILL SEE NO CHANGE IT IS TRUE MY YOUNG MEN DID NOT GO OUT ON THE WAR PATH THEY HAD DREAMS FOR NOT DOING SO BUT THEY LOVE AND VENERATE THE GREAT WHITE CHIEF
1502-122619-0052 WILL HE THINK SO WHEN HE HEARS THAT HIS GREATEST ENEMY IS FED IN THE CAMP OF HIS CHILDREN
1502-122619-0053 THAT THE PALE FACE WHO HAS SLAIN SO MANY OF HIS FRIENDS GOES IN AND OUT AMONG THE DELAWARES GO MY GREAT CANADA FATHER IS NOT A FOOL
1502-122619-0054 LA LONGUE CARABINE THE DELAWARE WARRIORS STARTED AT THE WELL KNOWN NAME BETRAYING BY THEIR AMAZEMENT THAT THEY NOW LEARNED FOR THE FIRST TIME ONE SO FAMOUS AMONG THE INDIAN ALLIES OF FRANCE WAS WITHIN THEIR POWER
1502-122619-0055 WHAT DOES MY BROTHER MEAN DEMANDED LE COEUR DUR IN A TONE THAT BY ITS WONDER FAR EXCEEDED THE USUAL APATHY OF HIS RACE A HURON NEVER LIES RETURNED MAGUA COLDLY
1502-122619-0056 A LONG AND MUSING PAUSE SUCCEEDED THE CHIEF CONSULTED APART WITH HIS COMPANIONS AND MESSENGERS DESPATCHED TO COLLECT CERTAIN OTHERS OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED MEN OF THE TRIBE AS WARRIOR AFTER WARRIOR DROPPED IN
1502-122619-0057 THE NEWS SPREAD FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH UNTIL THE WHOLE ENCAMPMENT BECAME POWERFULLY AGITATED THE WOMEN SUSPENDED THEIR LABORS TO CATCH SUCH SYLLABLES AS UNGUARDEDLY FELL FROM THE LIPS OF THE CONSULTING WARRIORS
1502-122619-0058 THE BOYS DESERTED THEIR SPORTS AND WALKING FEARLESSLY AMONG THEIR FATHERS LOOKED UP IN CURIOUS ADMIRATION AS THEY HEARD THE BRIEF EXCLAMATIONS OF WONDER THEY SO FREELY EXPRESSED THE TEMERITY OF THEIR HATED FOE
1502-122619-0059 IN SHORT EVERY OCCUPATION WAS ABANDONED FOR THE TIME AND ALL OTHER PURSUITS SEEMED DISCARDED IN ORDER THAT THE TRIBE MIGHT FREELY INDULGE AFTER THEIR OWN PECULIAR MANNER IN AN OPEN EXPRESSION OF FEELING
1502-122619-0060 THE OLD MEN DISPOSED THEMSELVES SERIOUSLY TO CONSIDER THAT WHICH IT BECAME THE HONOR AND SAFETY OF THEIR TRIBE TO PERFORM UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES OF SO MUCH DELICACY AND EMBARRASSMENT
1502-122619-0061 MAGUA HAD NOT ONLY MAINTAINED HIS SEAT BUT THE VERY ATTITUDE HE HAD ORIGINALLY TAKEN AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE LODGE
1502-122619-0062 AND APPARENTLY AS UNCONCERNED AS IF HE HAD NO INTEREST IN THE RESULT
1502-122619-0063 ESCAPED HIS VIGILANT EYES
1502-122619-0064 HE ANTICIPATED EVERY MEASURE ON WHICH THEY DECIDED AND IT MIGHT ALMOST BE SAID
1502-122619-0065 AND FORMAL ASSEMBLAGE OF THE NATION AS SUCH MEETINGS WERE RARE AND ONLY CALLED ON OCCASIONS OF THE LAST IMPORTANCE THE SUBTLE HURON WHO STILL SAT APART
1502-122619-0066 NOW KNEW THAT ALL HIS PROJECTS MUST BE BROUGHT TO THEIR FINAL ISSUE
1502-122619-0067 IN FRONT OF THE ENCAMPMENT WHITHER THE WARRIORS WERE ALREADY BEGINNING TO COLLECT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HALF AN HOUR BEFORE EACH INDIVIDUAL INCLUDING EVEN THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN WAS IN HIS PLACE
1502-122619-0068 THE DELAY HAD BEEN CREATED BY THE GRAVE PREPARATIONS THAT WERE DEEMED NECESSARY TO SO SOLEMN AND UNUSUAL A CONFERENCE BUT WHEN THE SUN WAS SEEN CLIMBING ABOVE THE TOPS OF THAT MOUNTAIN
1502-122619-0069 ITS NUMBER SOMEWHAT EXCEEDED A THOUSAND SOULS
1502-122619-0070 STANDING READY TO MOVE HIS AUDITORS TO SOME HASTY AND PERHAPS INJUDICIOUS DISCUSSION
1502-122619-0071 UNTIL SUCH A ONE CHOSE TO MAKE SOME MOVEMENT NO DEEDS IN ARMS NO NATURAL GIFTS NOR ANY RENOWN AS AN ORATOR
1502-122619-0072 ON THE PRESENT OCCASION THE AGED WARRIOR WHOSE PRIVILEGE IT WAS TO SPEAK WAS SILENT SEEMINGLY OPPRESSED WITH THE MAGNITUDE OF HIS SUBJECT THE DELAY HAD ALREADY CONTINUED LONG BEYOND THE USUAL DELIBERATIVE PAUSE
1502-122619-0073 THAT ALWAYS PRECEDED A CONFERENCE BUT NO SIGN OF IMPATIENCE OR SURPRISE ESCAPED EVEN THE YOUNGEST BOY OCCASIONALLY AN EYE WAS RAISED FROM THE EARTH WHERE THE LOOKS OF MOST WERE RIVETED
1502-122619-0074 AND THREE MEN ISSUING FROM IT SLOWLY APPROACHED THE PLACE OF CONSULTATION THEY WERE ALL AGED EVEN BEYOND THAT PERIOD TO WHICH THE OLDEST PRESENT HAD REACHED BUT ONE IN THE CENTER WHO LEANED ON HIS COMPANIONS FOR SUPPORT
1502-122619-0075 HAD NUMBERED AN AMOUNT OF YEARS TO WHICH THE HUMAN RACE IS SELDOM PERMITTED TO ATTAIN HIS FRAME WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN TALL AND ERECT LIKE THE CEDAR WAS NOW BENDING UNDER THE PRESSURE OF MORE THAN A CENTURY
1502-122619-0076 THE ELASTIC LIGHT STEP OF AN INDIAN WAS GONE AND IN ITS PLACE HE WAS COMPELLED TO TOIL HIS TARDY WAY OVER THE GROUND
1502-122619-0077 HIS DARK WRINKLED COUNTENANCE WAS IN SINGULAR AND WILD CONTRAST WITH THE LONG WHITE LOCKS WHICH FLOATED ON HIS SHOULDERS
1502-122619-0078 SINCE THEY HAD LAST BEEN SHORN THE DRESS OF THIS PATRIARCH FOR SUCH CONSIDERING HIS VAST AGE IN CONJUNCTION WITH HIS AFFINITY AND INFLUENCE WITH HIS PEOPLE HE MIGHT VERY PROPERLY BE TERMED
1502-122619-0079 WAS RICH AND IMPOSING THOUGH STRICTLY AFTER THE SIMPLE FASHIONS OF THE TRIBE HIS ROBE WAS OF THE FINEST SKINS WHICH HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THEIR FUR
1502-122619-0080 OF VARIOUS DEEDS IN ARMS DONE IN FORMER AGES HIS BOSOM WAS LOADED WITH MEDALS SOME IN MASSIVE SILVER AND ONE OR TWO EVEN IN GOLD
1502-122619-0081 HE ALSO WORE ARMLETS AND CINCTURES ABOVE THE ANKLES OF THE LATTER PRECIOUS METAL
1502-122619-0082 IN TOUCHING CONTRAST TO THE COLOR OF HIS SNOW WHITE LOCKS HIS TOMAHAWK WAS NEARLY HID IN SILVER AND THE HANDLE OF HIS KNIFE SHONE LIKE A HORN OF SOLID GOLD SO SOON AS THE FIRST HUM OF EMOTION AND PLEASURE
1502-122619-0083 WHICH THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF THIS VENERATED INDIVIDUAL CREATED HAD A LITTLE SUBSIDED
1502-122619-0084 WAS WHISPERED FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH MAGUA HAD OFTEN HEARD THE FAME OF THIS WISE AND JUST DELAWARE
1502-122619-0085 WITH THE GREAT SPIRIT AND WHICH HAS SINCE TRANSMITTED HIS NAME WITH SOME SLIGHT ALTERATION TO THE WHITE USURPERS OF HIS ANCIENT TERRITORY
1502-122619-0086 THE HURON CHIEF THEREFORE STEPPED EAGERLY OUT A LITTLE FROM THE THRONG
1502-122619-0087 WHOSE DECISION WAS LIKELY TO PRODUCE SO DEEP AN INFLUENCE ON HIS OWN FORTUNES
1502-122619-0088 THE AMERICANS SOMETIMES CALLED THEIR TUTELAR SAINT TAMENAY A CORRUPTION OF THE NAME OF THE RENOWNED CHIEF HERE INTRODUCED
1502-122619-0089 THE EYES OF THE OLD MAN WERE CLOSED AS THOUGH THE ORGANS WERE WEARIED WITH HAVING SO LONG WITNESSED THE SELFISH WORKINGS OF THE HUMAN PASSIONS
1502-122619-0090 WITH THE DIGNITY OF A MONARCH AND THE AIR OF A FATHER
1502-122619-0091 WHO BELONGS RATHER TO ANOTHER WORLD THAN TO THIS WAS RECEIVED BY HIS PEOPLE AFTER A SUITABLE AND DECENT PAUSE
1502-122619-0092 AND APPROACHING THE PATRIARCH THEY PLACED HIS HANDS REVERENTLY ON THEIR HEADS SEEMING TO ENTREAT A BLESSING THE YOUNGER MEN WERE CONTENT WITH TOUCHING HIS ROBE OR EVEN DRAWING NIGH HIS PERSON
1502-122619-0093 SO JUST AND SO VALIANT NONE BUT THE MOST DISTINGUISHED AMONG THE YOUTHFUL WARRIORS EVEN PRESUMED SO FAR AS TO PERFORM THE LATTER CEREMONY THE GREAT MASS OF THE MULTITUDE DEEMING IT A SUFFICIENT HAPPINESS
1502-122619-0094 THE CHIEFS DREW BACK AGAIN TO THEIR SEVERAL PLACES AND SILENCE REIGNED IN THE WHOLE ENCAMPMENT
1502-122619-0095 AROSE LEFT THE CROWD AND ENTERED THE LODGE WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN NOTED AS THE OBJECT OF SO MUCH ATTENTION THROUGHOUT THAT MORNING
1502-122619-0096 ESCORTING THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD CAUSED ALL THESE SOLEMN PREPARATIONS TOWARD THE SEAT OF JUDGMENT THE CROWD OPENED IN A LANE AND WHEN THE PARTY HAD RE ENTERED
1553-140047-0000 SNOW WHITE ROSE RED JUST BEFORE THANKSGIVING THE AFFAIRS OF THE SIMPSONS REACHED WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CALLED A CRISIS EVEN IN THEIR FAMILY
1553-140047-0001 WHICH HAD BEEN BORN AND REARED IN A STATE OF ADVENTUROUS POVERTY AND PERILOUS UNCERTAINTY RIVERBORO WAS DOING ITS BEST TO RETURN THE ENTIRE TRIBE OF SIMPSONS TO THE LAND OF ITS FATHERS SO TO SPEAK
1553-140047-0002 THINKING RIGHTLY THAT THE TOWN WHICH HAD GIVEN THEM BIRTH RATHER THAN THE TOWN OF THEIR ADOPTION SHOULD FEED THEM AND KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS UNTIL THE CHILDREN WERE OF AN AGE FOR SELF SUPPORT THERE WAS LITTLE TO EAT IN THE HOUSEHOLD
1553-140047-0003 AND LESS TO WEAR THOUGH MISSUS SIMPSON DID AS ALWAYS HER POOR BEST THE CHILDREN MANAGED TO SATISFY THEIR APPETITES BY SITTING MODESTLY OUTSIDE THEIR NEIGHBORS KITCHEN DOORS WHEN MEALS WERE ABOUT TO BE SERVED
1553-140047-0004 THEY WERE NOT EXACTLY POPULAR FAVORITES BUT THEY DID RECEIVE CERTAIN UNDESIRABLE MORSELS FROM THE MORE CHARITABLE HOUSEWIVES LIFE WAS RATHER DULL AND DREARY HOWEVER AND IN THE CHILL AND GLOOM OF NOVEMBER WEATHER
1553-140047-0005 WITH THE VISION OF OTHER PEOPLE'S TURKEYS BURSTING WITH FAT AND OTHER PEOPLE'S GOLDEN PUMPKINS AND SQUASHES AND CORN BEING GARNERED INTO BARNS THE YOUNG SIMPSONS GROPED ABOUT FOR SOME INEXPENSIVE FORM OF EXCITEMENT
1553-140047-0006 AND SETTLED UPON THE SELLING OF SOAP FOR A PREMIUM THEY HAD SOLD ENOUGH TO THEIR IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS DURING THE EARLIER AUTUMN TO SECURE A CHILD'S HANDCART WHICH THOUGH VERY WEAK ON ITS PINS COULD BE TRUNDLED OVER THE COUNTRY ROADS
1553-140047-0007 WITH LARGE BUSINESS SAGACITY AND AN EXECUTIVE CAPACITY WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN INHERITED FROM THEIR FATHER THEY NOW PROPOSED TO EXTEND THEIR OPERATIONS TO A LARGER AREA AND DISTRIBUTE SOAP TO CONTIGUOUS VILLAGES
1553-140047-0008 IF THESE VILLAGES COULD BE INDUCED TO BUY THE EXCELSIOR SOAP COMPANY PAID A VERY SMALL RETURN OF ANY KIND TO ITS INFANTILE AGENTS WHO WERE SCATTERED THROUGH THE STATE BUT IT INFLAMED THEIR IMAGINATIONS BY THE ISSUE OF CIRCULARS
1553-140047-0009 WITH HIGHLY COLORED PICTURES OF THE PREMIUMS TO BE AWARDED FOR THE SALE OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CAKES IT WAS AT THIS JUNCTURE THAT CLARA BELLE AND SUSAN SIMPSON CONSULTED REBECCA WHO THREW HERSELF SOLIDLY AND WHOLEHEARTEDLY INTO THE ENTERPRISE
1553-140047-0010 PROMISING HER HELP AND THAT OF EMMA JANE PERKINS THE PREMIUMS WITHIN THEIR POSSIBLE GRASP WERE THREE A BOOKCASE A PLUSH RECLINING CHAIR AND A BANQUET LAMP OF COURSE THE SIMPSONS HAD NO BOOKS
1553-140047-0011 AND CASTING ASIDE WITHOUT THOUGHT OR PANG THE PLUSH CHAIR
1553-140047-0012 NOT COUNTING MISTER SIMPSON WHO ORDINARILY SAT ELSEWHERE AT THE TOWN'S EXPENSE THEY WARMED THEMSELVES RAPTUROUSLY IN THE VISION OF THE BANQUET LAMP WHICH SPEEDILY BECAME TO THEM MORE DESIRABLE THAN FOOD DRINK OR CLOTHING
1553-140047-0013 NEITHER EMMA JANE NOR REBECCA PERCEIVED ANYTHING INCONGRUOUS IN THE IDEA OF THE SIMPSONS STRIVING FOR A BANQUET LAMP THEY LOOKED AT THE PICTURE DAILY AND KNEW THAT IF THEY THEMSELVES WERE FREE AGENTS THEY WOULD TOIL SUFFER
1553-140047-0014 AY SWEAT FOR THE HAPPY PRIVILEGE OF OCCUPYING THE SAME ROOM WITH THAT LAMP THROUGH THE COMING WINTER EVENINGS IT LOOKED TO BE ABOUT EIGHT FEET TALL IN THE CATALOGUE AND EMMA JANE ADVISED CLARA BELLE TO MEASURE THE HEIGHT OF THE SIMPSON CEILINGS
1553-140047-0015 BUT A NOTE IN THE MARGIN OF THE CIRCULAR INFORMED THEM THAT IT STOOD TWO AND A HALF FEET HIGH WHEN SET UP IN ALL ITS DIGNITY AND SPLENDOR ON A PROPER TABLE THREE DOLLARS EXTRA IT WAS ONLY OF POLISHED BRASS CONTINUED THE CIRCULAR
1553-140047-0016 THOUGH IT WAS INVARIABLY MISTAKEN FOR SOLID GOLD AND THE SHADE THAT ACCOMPANIED IT AT LEAST IT ACCOMPANIED IT IF THE AGENT SOLD A HUNDRED EXTRA CAKES WAS OF CRINKLED CREPE PAPER PRINTED IN A DOZEN DELICIOUS HUES
1553-140047-0017 FROM WHICH THE JOY DAZZLED AGENT MIGHT TAKE HIS CHOICE SEESAW SIMPSON WAS NOT IN THE SYNDICATE CLARA BELLE WAS RATHER A SUCCESSFUL AGENT BUT SUSAN WHO COULD ONLY SAY THOAP NEVER MADE LARGE RETURNS
1553-140047-0018 AND THE TWINS WHO WERE SOMEWHAT YOUNG TO BE THOROUGHLY TRUSTWORTHY COULD BE GIVEN ONLY A HALF DOZEN CAKES AT A TIME AND WERE OBLIGED TO CARRY WITH THEM ON THEIR BUSINESS TRIPS A BRIEF DOCUMENT STATING THE PRICE PER CAKE DOZEN AND BOX
1553-140047-0019 REBECCA AND EMMA JANE OFFERED TO GO TWO OR THREE MILES IN SOME ONE DIRECTION AND SEE WHAT THEY COULD DO IN THE WAY OF STIRRING UP A POPULAR DEMAND FOR THE SNOW WHITE AND ROSE RED BRANDS THE FORMER BEING DEVOTED TO LAUNDRY PURPOSES
1553-140047-0020 AND THE LATTER BEING INTENDED FOR THE TOILET THERE WAS A GREAT AMOUNT OF HILARITY IN THE PREPARATION FOR THIS EVENT AND A LONG COUNCIL IN EMMA JANE'S ATTIC THEY HAD THE SOAP COMPANY'S CIRCULAR FROM WHICH TO ARRANGE A PROPER SPEECH
1553-140047-0021 AND THEY HAD WHAT WAS STILL BETTER THE REMEMBRANCE OF A CERTAIN PATENT MEDICINE VENDER'S DISCOURSE AT THE MILLTOWN FAIR HIS METHOD WHEN ONCE OBSERVED COULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN NOR HIS MANNER NOR HIS VOCABULARY
1553-140047-0022 EMMA JANE PRACTICED IT ON REBECCA AND REBECCA ON EMMA JANE CAN I SELL YOU A LITTLE SOAP THIS AFTERNOON IT IS CALLED THE SNOW WHITE AND ROSE RED SOAP
1553-140047-0023 SIX CAKES IN AN ORNAMENTAL BOX ONLY TWENTY CENTS FOR THE WHITE TWENTY FIVE CENTS FOR THE RED IT IS MADE FROM THE PUREST INGREDIENTS AND IF DESIRED COULD BE EATEN BY AN INVALID WITH RELISH AND PROFIT
1553-140047-0024 OH REBECCA DON'T LET'S SAY THAT INTERPOSED EMMA JANE HYSTERICALLY IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE A FOOL IT TAKES SO LITTLE TO MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE A FOOL EMMA JANE REBUKED REBECCA THAT SOMETIMES I THINK THAT YOU MUST BE ONE
1553-140047-0025 I DON'T GET TO FEELING LIKE A FOOL SO AWFULLY EASY NOW LEAVE OUT THAT EATING PART IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT AND GO ON THE SNOW WHITE IS PROBABLY THE MOST REMARKABLE LAUNDRY SOAP EVER MANUFACTURED
1553-140047-0026 IMMERSE THE GARMENTS IN A TUB LIGHTLY RUBBING THE MORE SOILED PORTIONS WITH THE SOAP LEAVE THEM SUBMERGED IN WATER FROM SUNSET TO SUNRISE AND THEN THE YOUNGEST BABY CAN WASH THEM WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST EFFORT
1553-140047-0027 BABE NOT BABY CORRECTED REBECCA FROM THE CIRCULAR IT'S JUST THE SAME THING ARGUED EMMA JANE OF COURSE IT'S JUST THE SAME THING BUT A BABY HAS GOT TO BE CALLED BABE OR INFANT IN A CIRCULAR
1553-140047-0028 THE SAME AS IT IS IN POETRY WOULD YOU RATHER SAY INFANT NO GRUMBLED EMMA JANE INFANT IS WORSE EVEN THAN BABE
1553-140047-0029 AND LET ELIJAH OR ELISHA TRY THE SOAP BEFORE WE BEGIN SELLING I CAN'T IMAGINE A BABE DOING A FAMILY WASH WITH ANY SOAP ANSWERED REBECCA BUT IT MUST BE TRUE OR THEY WOULD NEVER DARE TO PRINT IT SO DON'T LET'S BOTHER
1553-140047-0030 OH WON'T IT BE THE GREATEST FUN EMMA JANE AT SOME OF THE HOUSES WHERE THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY KNOW ME I SHAN'T BE FRIGHTENED AND I SHALL REEL OFF THE WHOLE RIGMAROLE INVALID BABE AND ALL
1553-140047-0031 PERHAPS I SHALL SAY EVEN THE LAST SENTENCE IF I CAN REMEMBER IT WE SOUND EVERY CHORD IN THE GREAT MAC RO COSM OF SATISFACTION
1553-140047-0032 THIS CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON AT EMMA JANE'S HOUSE WHERE REBECCA TO HER UNBOUNDED JOY WAS TO STAY OVER SUNDAY HER AUNTS HAVING GONE TO PORTLAND TO THE FUNERAL OF AN OLD FRIEND
1553-140047-0033 SATURDAY BEING A HOLIDAY THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE THE OLD WHITE HORSE DRIVE TO NORTH RIVERBORO THREE MILES AWAY EAT A TWELVE O'CLOCK DINNER WITH EMMA JANE'S COUSINS AND BE BACK AT FOUR O'CLOCK PUNCTUALLY
1553-140047-0034 WHEN THE CHILDREN ASKED MISSUS PERKINS IF THEY COULD CALL AT JUST A FEW HOUSES COMING AND GOING AND SELL A LITTLE SOAP FOR THE SIMPSONS SHE AT FIRST REPLIED DECIDEDLY IN THE NEGATIVE
1553-140047-0035 SHE WAS AN INDULGENT PARENT HOWEVER AND REALLY HAD LITTLE OBJECTION TO EMMA JANE AMUSING HERSELF IN THIS UNUSUAL WAY IT WAS ONLY FOR REBECCA AS THE NIECE OF THE DIFFICULT MIRANDA SAWYER THAT SHE RAISED SCRUPLES
1553-140047-0036 BUT WHEN FULLY PERSUADED THAT THE ENTERPRISE WAS A CHARITABLE ONE SHE ACQUIESCED THE GIRLS CALLED AT MISTER WATSON'S STORE AND ARRANGED FOR SEVERAL LARGE BOXES OF SOAP TO BE CHARGED TO CLARA BELLE SIMPSON'S ACCOUNT
1553-140047-0037 THESE WERE LIFTED INTO THE BACK OF THE WAGON AND A HAPPIER COUPLE NEVER DROVE ALONG THE COUNTRY ROAD THAN REBECCA AND HER COMPANION IT WAS A GLORIOUS INDIAN SUMMER DAY WHICH SUGGESTED NOTHING OF THANKSGIVING NEAR AT HAND AS IT WAS
1553-140047-0038 IT WAS A RUSTLY DAY A SCARLET AND BUFF YELLOW AND CARMINE BRONZE AND CRIMSON DAY THERE WERE STILL MANY LEAVES ON THE OAKS AND MAPLES MAKING A GOODLY SHOW OF RED AND BROWN AND GOLD
1553-140047-0039 THE AIR WAS LIKE SPARKLING CIDER AND EVERY FIELD HAD ITS HEAPS OF YELLOW AND RUSSET GOOD THINGS TO EAT ALL READY FOR THE BARNS THE MILLS AND THE MARKETS THE HORSE FORGOT HIS TWENTY YEARS
1553-140047-0040 SNIFFED THE SWEET BRIGHT AIR AND TROTTED LIKE A COLT NOKOMIS MOUNTAIN LOOKED BLUE AND CLEAR IN THE DISTANCE REBECCA STOOD IN THE WAGON AND APOSTROPHIZED THE LANDSCAPE WITH SUDDEN JOY OF LIVING
1553-140047-0041 GREAT WIDE BEAUTIFUL WONDERFUL WORLD WITH THE WONDERFUL WATER ROUND YOU CURLED AND THE WONDERFUL GRASS UPON YOUR BREAST WORLD YOU ARE BEAUTIFULLY DREST
1553-140047-0042 DULL EMMA JANE HAD NEVER SEEMED TO REBECCA SO NEAR SO DEAR SO TRIED AND TRUE AND REBECCA TO EMMA JANE'S FAITHFUL HEART HAD NEVER BEEN SO BRILLIANT SO BEWILDERING SO FASCINATING AS IN THIS VISIT TOGETHER
1553-140047-0043 WITH ITS INTIMACY ITS FREEDOM AND THE ADDED DELIGHTS OF AN EXCITING BUSINESS ENTERPRISE A GORGEOUS LEAF BLEW INTO THE WAGON DOES COLOR MAKE YOU SORT OF DIZZY ASKED REBECCA
1553-140047-0044 NO IT DON'T NOT A MITE PERHAPS DIZZY ISN'T JUST THE RIGHT WORD BUT IT'S NEAREST I'D LIKE TO EAT COLOR AND DRINK IT AND SLEEP IN IT IF YOU COULD BE A TREE WHICH ONE WOULD YOU CHOOSE
1553-140047-0045 EMMA JANE HAD ENJOYED CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE OF THIS KIND AND REBECCA HAD SUCCEEDED IN UNSTOPPING HER EARS UNGLUING HER EYES AND LOOSENING HER TONGUE SO THAT SHE COULD PLAY THE GAME AFTER A FASHION
1553-140047-0046 I'D RATHER BE AN APPLE TREE IN BLOSSOM THAT ONE THAT BLOOMS PINK BY OUR PIG PEN REBECCA LAUGHED THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING UNEXPECTED IN EMMA JANE'S REPLIES
1553-140047-0047 I'D CHOOSE TO BE THAT SCARLET MAPLE JUST ON THE EDGE OF THE POND THERE AND SHE POINTED WITH THE WHIP THEN I COULD SEE SO MUCH MORE THAN YOUR PINK APPLE TREE BY THE PIG PEN I COULD LOOK AT ALL THE REST OF THE WOODS
1553-140047-0048 SEE MY SCARLET DRESS IN MY BEAUTIFUL LOOKING GLASS AND WATCH ALL THE YELLOW AND BROWN TREES GROWING UPSIDE DOWN IN THE WATER WHEN I'M OLD ENOUGH TO EARN MONEY I'M GOING TO HAVE A DRESS LIKE THIS LEAF
1553-140047-0049 THEN I THINK I'LL HAVE A BROWN SASH LIKE THE TRUNK OF THE TREE AND WHERE COULD I BE GREEN DO THEY HAVE GREEN PETTICOATS I WONDER I'D LIKE A GREEN PETTICOAT COMING OUT NOW AND THEN UNDERNEATH
1553-140047-0050 TO SHOW WHAT MY LEAVES WERE LIKE BEFORE I WAS A SCARLET MAPLE I THINK IT WOULD BE AWFUL HOMELY SAID EMMA JANE
1553-140047-0051 WITH A PINK SASH PINK STOCKINGS BRONZE SLIPPERS
1553-140048-0000 THEY DID NOT ACCOMPANY EACH OTHER TO THE DOORS OF THEIR CHOSEN VICTIMS FEELING SURE THAT TOGETHER THEY COULD NOT APPROACH THE SUBJECT SERIOUSLY BUT THEY PARTED AT THE GATE OF EACH HOUSE THE ONE HOLDING THE HORSE WHILE THE OTHER TOOK THE SOAP SAMPLES
1553-140048-0001 AND INTERVIEWED ANY ONE WHO SEEMED OF A COMING ON DISPOSITION EMMA JANE HAD DISPOSED OF THREE SINGLE CAKES REBECCA OF THREE SMALL BOXES FOR A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR ABILITY TO PERSUADE THE PUBLIC WAS CLEARLY DEFINED AT THE START
1553-140048-0002 THOUGH NEITHER OF THEM ASCRIBED EITHER SUCCESS OR DEFEAT TO ANYTHING BUT THE IMPERIOUS FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES HOUSEWIVES LOOKED AT EMMA JANE AND DESIRED NO SOAP LISTENED TO HER DESCRIPTION OF ITS MERITS AND STILL DESIRED NONE
1553-140048-0003 OTHER STARS IN THEIR COURSES GOVERNED REBECCA'S DOINGS THE PEOPLE WHOM SHE INTERVIEWED EITHER REMEMBERED THEIR PRESENT NEED OF SOAP OR REMINDED THEMSELVES THAT THEY WOULD NEED IT IN THE FUTURE THE NOTABLE POINT IN THE CASE BEING
1553-140048-0004 THAT LUCKY REBECCA ACCOMPLISHED WITH ALMOST NO EFFORT RESULTS THAT POOR LITTLE EMMA JANE FAILED TO ATTAIN BY HARD AND CONSCIENTIOUS LABOR IT'S YOUR TURN REBECCA AND I'M GLAD TOO SAID EMMA JANE
1553-140048-0005 DRAWING UP TO A GATEWAY AND INDICATING A HOUSE THAT WAS SET A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THE ROAD I HAVEN'T GOT OVER TREMBLING FROM THE LAST PLACE YET A LADY HAD PUT HER HEAD OUT OF AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW AND CALLED

1553-140048-0014 AND THE PRICES OF BOTH THAT AND THE SNOW WHITE WERE UNFOLDED PRESENTLY SHE FORGOT ALL ABOUT HER SILENT PARTNER AT THE GATE AND WAS TALKING AS IF SHE HAD KNOWN THIS GRAND PERSONAGE ALL HER LIFE

1553-140048-0023 WE ARE NOT SELLING FOR OUR OWN BENEFIT SAID REBECCA CONFIDENTIALLY MY FRIEND WHO IS HOLDING THE HORSE AT THE GATE IS THE DAUGHTER OF A VERY RICH BLACKSMITH AND DOESN'T NEED ANY MONEY
1553-140048-0024 WE ARE TRYING TO GET A PREMIUM FOR SOME FRIENDS OF OURS REBECCA HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF ALLUDING TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES WITH HER PREVIOUS CUSTOMERS BUT UNEXPECTEDLY SHE FOUND HERSELF DESCRIBING MISTER SIMPSON MISSUS SIMPSON AND THE SIMPSON FAMILY

1553-140048-0048 BY DINT OF SUPERHUMAN EFFORT AND PUTTING SUCH A SEAL UPON THEIR LIPS AS NEVER MORTALS PUT BEFORE THE TWO GIRLS SUCCEEDED IN KEEPING THEIR WONDERFUL NEWS TO THEMSELVES
1553-140048-0049 ON THANKSGIVING THE LAMP ARRIVED IN A LARGE PACKING BOX AND WAS TAKEN OUT AND SET UP BY SEESAW SIMPSON WHO SUDDENLY BEGAN TO ADMIRE AND RESPECT THE BUSINESS ABILITY OF HIS SISTERS
1578-140045-0000 THE STIRRING OF THE POWERS REBECCA'S VISIT TO MILLTOWN WAS ALL THAT HER GLOWING FANCY HAD PAINTED IT EXCEPT THAT RECENT READINGS ABOUT ROME AND VENICE DISPOSED HER TO BELIEVE THAT THOSE CITIES MIGHT HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER MILLTOWN
1578-140045-0001 IN THE MATTER OF MERE PICTORIAL BEAUTY SO SOON DOES THE SOUL OUTGROW ITS MANSIONS THAT AFTER ONCE SEEING MILLTOWN HER FANCY RAN OUT TO THE FUTURE SIGHT OF PORTLAND FOR THAT HAVING ISLANDS AND A HARBOR AND TWO PUBLIC MONUMENTS
1578-140045-0002 MUST BE FAR MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN MILLTOWN WHICH WOULD SHE FELT TAKE ITS PROUD PLACE AMONG THE CITIES OF THE EARTH BY REASON OF ITS TREMENDOUS BUSINESS ACTIVITY RATHER THAN BY ANY IRRESISTIBLE APPEAL TO THE IMAGINATION
1578-140045-0003 I TELL YOU HARRIET BEECHER STOWE HERSELF COULDN'T A DONE IT BETTER JUSTICE I TOOK IT ALL IN RESPONDED MISTER COBB WHO WAS PLEASED THAT MOTHER AGREED WITH HIM ABOUT REBECCA I AIN'T SURE BUT SHE'S GOIN TO TURN OUT SOMETHIN REMARKABLE
1578-140045-0004 LAND NO MOTHER THERE AIN'T NO HOME'PATH BOUT MISS PARKS SHE DRIVES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY I CAN'T SEE REBECCA AS A LADY DOCTOR SOMEHOW MUSED MISSUS COBB HER GIFT O GAB IS WHAT'S GOIN TO BE THE MAKIN OF HER
1578-140045-0005 OR RECITE PIECES LIKE THAT PORTLAND ELOCUTIONIST THAT COME OUT HERE TO THE HARVEST SUPPER I GUESS SHE'LL BE ABLE TO WRITE DOWN HER OWN PIECES SAID MISTER COBB CONFIDENTLY SHE COULD MAKE EM UP FASTER N SHE COULD READ EM OUT OF A BOOK
1578-140045-0006 REBECCA MADE A POOR HAND AT COMPOSITION WRITING AT THIS TIME MISS DEARBORN GAVE HER EVERY SORT OF SUBJECT THAT SHE HAD EVER BEEN GIVEN HERSELF CLOUD PICTURES ABRAHAM LINCOLN NATURE PHILANTHROPY SLAVERY INTEMPERANCE JOY AND DUTY
1578-140045-0007 SOLITUDE BUT WITH NONE OF THEM DID REBECCA SEEM TO GRAPPLE SATISFACTORILY WRITE AS YOU TALK REBECCA INSISTED POOR MISS DEARBORN WHO SECRETLY KNEW THAT SHE COULD NEVER MANAGE A GOOD COMPOSITION HERSELF
1578-140045-0008 NOW IN YOUR LAST ONE ON SOLITUDE YOU HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING VERY INTERESTING AND YOU'VE MADE IT TOO COMMON AND EVERY DAY TO SOUND WELL THERE ARE TOO MANY YOUS AND YOURS IN IT YOU OUGHT TO SAY ONE NOW AND THEN TO MAKE IT SEEM MORE LIKE GOOD WRITING ONE OPENS A FAVORITE BOOK
1578-140045-0009 ONE'S THOUGHTS ARE A GREAT COMFORT IN SOLITUDE AND SO ON I DON'T KNOW ANY MORE ABOUT SOLITUDE THIS WEEK THAN I DID ABOUT JOY AND DUTY LAST WEEK GRUMBLED REBECCA YOU TRIED TO BE FUNNY ABOUT JOY AND DUTY SAID MISS DEARBORN REPROVINGLY SO OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T SUCCEED
1578-140045-0010 OF RECOLLECTION JOY AND DUTY HAD BEEN THE INSPIRING SUBJECT GIVEN TO THE OLDER CHILDREN FOR A THEME TO BE WRITTEN IN FIVE MINUTES REBECCA HAD WRESTLED STRUGGLED PERSPIRED IN VAIN WHEN HER TURN CAME TO READ
1578-140045-0011 SHE WAS OBLIGED TO CONFESS SHE HAD WRITTEN NOTHING YOU HAVE AT LEAST TWO LINES REBECCA INSISTED THE TEACHER FOR I SEE THEM ON YOUR SLATE
1578-140045-0012 READ WHAT YOU HAVE GOOD OR BAD LITTLE OR MUCH I AM EXCUSING NOBODY REBECCA ROSE OVERCOME WITH SECRET LAUGHTER DREAD AND MORTIFICATION THEN IN A LOW VOICE SHE READ THE COUPLET
1578-140045-0013 AND THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG IDEA SELDOM APPEALED TO THE SENSE OF HUMOR YOU MUST STAY AFTER SCHOOL AND TRY AGAIN REBECCA SHE SAID BUT SHE SAID IT SMILINGLY YOUR POETRY HASN'T A VERY NICE IDEA IN IT FOR A GOOD LITTLE GIRL WHO OUGHT TO LOVE DUTY
1578-140045-0014 IT WASN'T MY IDEA SAID REBECCA APOLOGETICALLY I HAD ONLY MADE THE FIRST LINE WHEN I SAW YOU WERE GOING TO RING THE BELL AND SAY THE TIME WAS UP I HAD CLASH WRITTEN AND I COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING THEN BUT HASH OR RASH OR SMASH I'LL CHANGE IT TO THIS
1578-140045-0015 HAVING BEEN INSTRUCTED IN THE USE OF THE INDEFINITE PRONOUN ONE AS GIVING A REFINED AND ELEGANT TOUCH TO LITERARY EFFORTS REBECCA PAINSTAKINGLY REWROTE HER COMPOSITION ON SOLITUDE GIVING IT ALL THE BENEFIT OF MISS DEARBORN'S SUGGESTION
1578-140045-0016 IT THEN APPEARED IN THE FOLLOWING FORM WHICH HARDLY SATISFIED EITHER TEACHER OR PUPIL SOLITUDE IT WOULD BE FALSE TO SAY THAT ONE COULD EVER BE ALONE WHEN ONE HAS ONE'S LOVELY THOUGHTS TO COMFORT ONE
1578-140045-0017 ONE SITS BY ONE'S SELF IT IS TRUE BUT ONE THINKS ONE OPENS ONE'S FAVORITE BOOK AND READS ONE'S FAVORITE STORY ONE SPEAKS TO ONE'S AUNT OR ONE'S BROTHER FONDLES ONE'S CAT
1578-140045-0018 DOES ONE EVER FEEL BEREFT WHEN ONE PICKS UP ONE'S CHIPS TO LIGHT ONE'S FIRE FOR ONE'S EVENING MEAL OR WHEN ONE WASHES ONE'S MILK PAIL BEFORE MILKING ONE'S COW ONE WOULD FANCY NOT R R R
1578-140045-0019 DON'T YOU THINK CALLING SUPPER ONE'S EVENING MEAL IS PRETTY AND ISN'T BEREFT A NICE WORD YES THAT PART OF IT DOES VERY WELL IT IS THE CAT THE CHIPS AND THE MILK PAIL THAT I DON'T LIKE
1578-140045-0020 YES I DON'T LIKE A COW IN A COMPOSITION SAID THE DIFFICULT MISS DEARBORN
1578-140045-0021 FOR THE NEXT WEEK MINNIE SMELLIE'S MOTHER TOLD MIRANDA SAWYER THAT SHE'D BETTER LOOK AFTER REBECCA FOR SHE WAS GIVEN TO SWEARING AND PROFANE LANGUAGE THAT SHE HAD BEEN HEARD SAYING SOMETHING DREADFUL THAT VERY AFTERNOON SAYING IT BEFORE EMMA JANE AND LIVING PERKINS WHO ONLY LAUGHED
1578-140045-0022 DON'T BE UGLY AND OBSTINATE BUT THINK REAL HARD WHEN DID THEY CHASE YOU UP THE ROAD AND WHAT WERE YOU DOING A SUDDEN LIGHT BROKE UPON REBECCA'S DARKNESS
1578-140045-0023 EMMA JANE LIVING AND I WERE WALKING ALONG AND I WAS AHEAD I SAW THE WATER STREAMING OVER THE ROAD TOWARDS THE DITCH AND IT REMINDED ME OF UNCLE TOM'S CABIN AT MILLTOWN WHEN ELIZA TOOK HER BABY AND RAN ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI ON THE ICE BLOCKS PURSUED BY THE BLOODHOUNDS
1578-140045-0024 WE COULDN'T KEEP FROM LAUGHING AFTER WE CAME OUT OF THE TENT BECAUSE THEY WERE ACTING ON SUCH A SMALL PLATFORM THAT ELIZA HAD TO RUN ROUND AND ROUND
1578-140045-0025 AND PART OF THE TIME SHE HAD TO PURSUE THE DOG I KNEW LIVING WOULD REMEMBER TOO SO I TOOK OFF MY WATERPROOF AND WRAPPED IT ROUND MY BOOKS FOR A BABY
1578-140045-0026 JUST LIKE THAT THE SAME AS ELIZA DID IN THE PLAY THEN I LEAPED FROM PUDDLE TO PUDDLE AND LIVING AND EMMA JANE PURSUED ME LIKE THE BLOODHOUNDS IT'S JUST LIKE THAT STUPID MINNIE SMELLIE WHO DOESN'T KNOW A GAME WHEN SHE SEES ONE AND ELIZA WASN'T SWEARING WHEN SHE SAID MY GOD THE RIVER
1578-140045-0027 IT WAS MORE LIKE PRAYING WELL YOU'VE GOT NO CALL TO BE PRAYIN ANY MORE THAN SWEARIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD SAID MIRANDA BUT I'M THANKFUL IT'S NO WORSE YOU'RE BORN TO TROUBLE AS THE SPARKS FLY UPWARD
1578-140045-0028 AN I'M AFRAID YOU ALLERS WILL BE TILL YOU LEARN TO BRIDLE YOUR UNRULY TONGUE I WISH SOMETIMES THAT I COULD BRIDLE MINNIE'S MURMURED REBECCA AS SHE WENT TO SET THE TABLE FOR SUPPER I DECLARE SHE IS THE BEATIN'EST CHILD SAID MIRANDA
1578-140045-0029 BUT WHETHER IT'S FOR THE BETTER OR THE WORSE I CAN'T HARDLY TELL TILL SHE GROWS UP SHE'S GOT THE MAKING OF MOST ANYTHING IN HER REBECCA HAS BUT I FEEL SOMETIMES AS IF WE WERE NOT FITTED TO COPE WITH HER STUFF AN NONSENSE SAID MIRANDA
1578-140049-0000 THE BANQUET LAMP THERE HAD BEEN COMPANY AT THE BRICK HOUSE TO THE BOUNTIFUL THANKSGIVING DINNER WHICH HAD BEEN PROVIDED AT ONE O'CLOCK THE BURNHAM SISTERS WHO LIVED BETWEEN NORTH RIVERBORO AND SHAKER VILLAGE AND WHO FOR MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY
1578-140049-0001 HAD COME TO PASS THE HOLIDAY WITH THE SAWYERS EVERY YEAR REBECCA SAT SILENT WITH A BOOK AFTER THE DINNER DISHES WERE WASHED AND WHEN IT WAS NEARLY FIVE ASKED IF SHE MIGHT GO TO THE SIMPSONS
1578-140049-0002 CAN'T YOU SET STILL FOR ONCE AND LISTEN TO THE IMPROVIN CONVERSATION OF YOUR ELDERS
1578-140049-0003 WHAT UNDER THE CANOPY DID THEY WANT OF A LAMP AND WHERE DID THEY GET THE MONEY TO PAY FOR IT IF ABNER WAS AT HOME I SHOULD THINK HE'D BEEN SWAPPIN AGAIN SAID MISS MIRANDA THE CHILDREN GOT IT AS A PRIZE FOR SELLING SOAP REPLIED REBECCA
1578-140049-0004 WHAT HAVE YOU GOT IN THE POCKET OF THAT NEW DRESS THAT MAKES IT SAG DOWN SO IT'S MY NUTS AND RAISINS FROM DINNER REPLIED REBECCA WHO NEVER SUCCEEDED IN KEEPING THE MOST INNOCENT ACTION A SECRET FROM HER AUNT MIRANDA THEY'RE JUST WHAT YOU GAVE ME ON MY PLATE WHY DIDN'T YOU EAT THEM
1578-140049-0005 THEY WERE YOUR OWN REBECCA INTERPOSED AUNT JANE AND IF YOU CHOSE TO SAVE THEM TO GIVE AWAY IT IS ALL RIGHT WE OUGHT NEVER TO LET THIS DAY PASS WITHOUT GIVING OUR NEIGHBORS SOMETHING TO BE THANKFUL FOR INSTEAD OF TAKING ALL THE TIME TO THINK OF OUR OWN MERCIES
1578-140049-0006 THE BURNHAM SISTERS NODDED APPROVINGLY AS REBECCA WENT OUT AND REMARKED THAT THEY HAD NEVER SEEN A CHILD GROW AND IMPROVE SO FAST IN SO SHORT A TIME THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM LEFT FOR MORE IMPROVEMENT AS YOU'D KNOW IF SHE LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH YOU ANSWERED MIRANDA
1578-140049-0007 ONE OF THEM MUST HAVE SAID MISS ELLEN BURNHAM
1578-140049-0008 IT MUST HAVE BEEN CLARA BELLE AND I SHOULD NEVER CALL HER REMARKABLE ANSWERED MISS MIRANDA HAS ADAM BEEN HOME AGAIN YES HE'S BEEN STAYING A FEW DAYS WITH HIS AUNT THERE'S NO LIMIT TO THE MONEY HE'S MAKING THEY SAY AND HE ALWAYS BRINGS PRESENTS FOR ALL THE NEIGHBORS
1578-140049-0009 THIS TIME IT WAS A FULL SET OF FURS FOR MISSUS LADD AND TO THINK WE CAN REMEMBER THE TIME HE WAS A BAREFOOT BOY WITHOUT TWO SHIRTS TO HIS BACK IT IS STRANGE HE HASN'T MARRIED WITH ALL HIS MONEY AND HIM SO FOND OF CHILDREN THAT HE ALWAYS HAS A PACK OF THEM AT HIS HEELS
1578-140049-0010 THERE'S HOPE FOR HIM STILL THOUGH SAID MISS JANE SMILINGLY FOR I DON'T S'POSE HE'S MORE THAN THIRTY HE COULD GET A WIFE IN RIVERBORO IF HE WAS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY REMARKED MISS MIRANDA ADAM'S AUNT SAYS HE WAS SO TAKEN WITH THE LITTLE GIRL THAT SOLD THE SOAP CLARA BELLE DID YOU SAY HER NAME WAS

1578-140049-0012 FOR THIS ONE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN CROSS EYED I REMEMBER MISSUS LADD SAYING ADAM REMARKED ABOUT THIS CHILD'S HANDSOME EYES HE SAID IT WAS HER EYES THAT MADE HIM BUY THE THREE HUNDRED CAKES MISSUS LADD HAS IT STACKED UP IN THE SHED CHAMBER
1578-140049-0013 THREE HUNDRED CAKES EJACULATED MIRANDA WELL THERE'S ONE CROP THAT NEVER FAILS IN RIVERBORO WHAT'S THAT ASKED MISS LYDIA POLITELY THE FOOL CROP RESPONDED MIRANDA TERSELY
1578-140049-0014 AND CHANGED THE SUBJECT MUCH TO JANE'S GRATITUDE FOR SHE HAD BEEN NERVOUS AND ILL AT EASE FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES WHAT CHILD IN RIVERBORO COULD BE DESCRIBED AS REMARKABLE AND WINNING SAVE REBECCA WHAT CHILD HAD WONDERFUL EYES EXCEPT THE SAME REBECCA
1578-140049-0015 AND FINALLY WAS THERE EVER A CHILD IN THE WORLD WHO COULD MAKE A MAN BUY SOAP BY THE HUNDRED CAKES SAVE REBECCA MEANTIME THE REMARKABLE CHILD HAD FLOWN UP THE ROAD IN THE DEEPENING DUSK BUT SHE HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE SHE HEARD THE SOUND OF HURRYING FOOTSTEPS
1578-140049-0016 AND SAW A WELL KNOWN FIGURE COMING IN HER DIRECTION IN A MOMENT SHE AND EMMA JANE MET AND EXCHANGED A BREATHLESS EMBRACE SOMETHING AWFUL HAS HAPPENED PANTED EMMA JANE DON'T TELL ME IT'S BROKEN EXCLAIMED REBECCA NO OH NO NOT THAT

1578-140049-0018 BUT WHAT'S THE TROUBLE THE SIMPSONS HAVE NO KEROSENE AND NO WICKS I GUESS THEY THOUGHT A BANQUET LAMP WAS SOMETHING THAT LIGHTED ITSELF AND BURNED WITHOUT ANY HELP SEESAW HAS GONE TO THE DOCTOR'S TO TRY IF HE CAN BORROW A WICK AND MOTHER LET ME HAVE A PINT OF OIL BUT SHE SAYS SHE WON'T GIVE ME ANY MORE
1578-140049-0019 WE NEVER THOUGHT OF THE EXPENSE OF KEEPING UP THE LAMP REBECCA NO WE DIDN'T BUT LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THAT TILL AFTER THE PARTY I HAVE A HANDFUL OF NUTS AND RAISINS AND SOME APPLES I HAVE PEPPERMINTS AND MAPLE SUGAR SAID EMMA JANE THEY HAD A REAL THANKSGIVING DINNER

1578-140049-0021 MISSUS SIMPSON HAD LET THE KITCHEN FIRE DIE OUT AND HAD BROUGHT THE BABY TO GRACE THE FESTAL SCENE
1578-140049-0022 ON IT STOOD THE SACRED THE ADORED THE LONG DESIRED OBJECT ALMOST AS BEAUTIFUL AND NEARLY HALF AS LARGE AS THE ADVERTISEMENT THE BRASS GLISTENED LIKE GOLD AND THE CRIMSON PAPER SHADE GLOWED LIKE A GIANT RUBY
1578-140049-0023 IN THE WIDE SPLASH OF LIGHT THAT IT FLUNG UPON THE FLOOR SAT THE SIMPSONS IN REVERENT AND SOLEMN SILENCE EMMA JANE STANDING BEHIND THEM HAND IN HAND WITH REBECCA THERE SEEMED TO BE NO DESIRE FOR CONVERSATION THE OCCASION WAS TOO THRILLING AND SERIOUS FOR THAT
1578-140049-0024 THE LAMP IT WAS TACITLY FELT BY EVERYBODY WAS DIGNIFYING THE PARTY AND PROVIDING SUFFICIENT ENTERTAINMENT SIMPLY BY ITS PRESENCE BEING FULLY AS SATISFACTORY IN ITS WAY AS A PIANOLA OR A STRING BAND I WISH FATHER COULD SEE IT SAID CLARA BELLE LOYALLY
1578-140049-0025 MURMURED SUSAN SAGACIOUSLY AT THE APPOINTED HOUR REBECCA DRAGGED HERSELF RELUCTANTLY AWAY FROM THE ENCHANTING SCENE
1578-140049-0026 AND OH I'M SO GLAD YOU BOTH LIVE WHERE YOU CAN SEE IT SHINE FROM OUR WINDOWS I WONDER HOW LONG IT WILL BURN WITHOUT BEIN FILLED IF I ONLY KEEP IT LIT ONE HOUR EVERY NIGHT
1578-140049-0027 MISTER TUBBS BROUGHT IT OVER FROM NORTH RIVERBORO AND SAID SOMEBODY SENT AN ORDER BY MAIL FOR IT REBECCA SQUEEZED EMMA JANE'S ARM AND EMMA JANE GAVE A RAPTUROUS RETURN SQUEEZE
1578-140049-0028 IT WAS MISTER ALADDIN WHISPERED REBECCA AS THEY RAN DOWN THE PATH TO THE GATE SEESAW FOLLOWED THEM AND HANDSOMELY OFFERED TO SEE THEM APIECE DOWN THE ROAD BUT REBECCA DECLINED HIS ESCORT WITH SUCH DECISION THAT HE DID NOT PRESS THE MATTER
1578-140049-0029 BUT WENT TO BED TO DREAM OF HER INSTEAD IN HIS DREAMS FLASHES OF LIGHTNING PROCEEDED FROM BOTH HER EYES AND SHE HELD A FLAMING SWORD IN EITHER HAND REBECCA ENTERED THE HOME DINING ROOM JOYOUSLY THE BURNHAM SISTERS HAD GONE AND THE TWO AUNTS WERE KNITTING
1578-140049-0030 IT WAS A HEAVENLY PARTY SHE CRIED TAKING OFF HER HAT AND CAPE GO BACK AND SEE IF YOU HAVE SHUT THE DOOR TIGHT AND THEN LOCK IT SAID MISS MIRANDA IN HER USUAL AUSTERE MANNER
1578-140049-0031 AND OH AUNT JANE AUNT MIRANDA IF YOU'LL ONLY COME INTO THE KITCHEN AND LOOK OUT OF THE SINK WINDOW YOU CAN SEE THE BANQUET LAMP SHINING ALL RED JUST AS IF THE SIMPSONS HOUSE WAS ON FIRE AND PROBABLY IT WILL BE BEFORE LONG OBSERVED MIRANDA I'VE GOT NO PATIENCE WITH SUCH FOOLISH GOIN'S ON
1578-140049-0032 JANE ACCOMPANIED REBECCA INTO THE KITCHEN ALTHOUGH THE FEEBLE GLIMMER WHICH SHE WAS ABLE TO SEE FROM THAT DISTANCE DID NOT SEEM TO HER A DAZZLING EXHIBITION SHE TRIED TO BE AS ENTHUSIASTIC AS POSSIBLE REBECCA WHO WAS IT
1578-140049-0033 THAT SOLD THE THREE HUNDRED CAKES OF SOAP TO MISTER LADD IN NORTH RIVERBORO MISTER WHO EXCLAIMED REBECCA MISTER LADD IN NORTH RIVERBORO IS THAT HIS REAL NAME QUERIED REBECCA IN ASTONISHMENT I DIDN'T MAKE A BAD GUESS AND SHE LAUGHED SOFTLY TO HERSELF
1578-140049-0034 I ASKED YOU WHO SOLD THE SOAP TO ADAM LADD RESUMED MISS JANE ADAM LADD THEN HE'S A LADD TOO WHAT FUN ANSWER ME REBECCA OH EXCUSE ME AUNT JANE I WAS SO BUSY THINKING EMMA JANE AND I SOLD THE SOAP TO MISTER LADD

1578-140049-0036 THERE CAN'T BE ANYTHING WRONG THIS TIME REBECCA ANSWERED CONFIDENTLY EMMA JANE SOLD HER CAKES TO HER OWN RELATIONS AND TO UNCLE JERRY COBB AND I WENT FIRST TO THOSE NEW TENEMENTS NEAR THE LUMBER MILL AND THEN TO THE LADDS MISTER LADD BOUGHT ALL WE HAD AND MADE US PROMISE TO KEEP THE SECRET UNTIL THE PREMIUM CAME
1578-140049-0037 REBECCA'S HAIR WAS LOOSENED AND FALLING OVER HER FOREHEAD IN RUFFLED WAVES HER EYES WERE BRILLIANT HER CHEEKS CRIMSON THERE WAS A HINT OF EVERYTHING IN THE GIRL'S FACE OF SENSITIVENESS AND DELICACY AS WELL AS OF ARDOR
1578-140049-0038 THERE WAS THE SWEETNESS OF THE MAYFLOWER AND THE STRENGTH OF THE YOUNG OAK BUT ONE COULD EASILY DIVINE THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THE SOULS BY NATURE PITCHED TOO HIGH BY SUFFERING PLUNGED TOO LOW
1578-6379-0000 THE THIRD MAN FROM THE END OH PATTY DID YOU BRING US SOME WEDDING CAKE DID YOU HAVE ANY ADVENTURES
1578-6379-0001 WITH THE DEXTERITY OF PRACTICE SPRANG UPON THE REAR STEP OF THE HEARSE AS IT TURNED IN AT THE SCHOOL GATE AND ROLLED UP THE CURVING DRIVE TO THE PORTE COCHERE THE HEARSE WAS THE POPULAR NAME FOR THE BLACK VARNISHED WAGONETTE WHICH CONVEYED THE PUPILS OF SAINT URSULA'S FROM CHURCH AND STATION
1578-6379-0002 IT WAS PLANNED TO ACCOMMODATE TWENTY PATTY AND HER SUIT CASE ALONE IN THE CAPACIOUS INTERIOR WERE JOLTING ABOUT LIKE TWO TINY PEAS IN A VERY BIG POD
1578-6379-0003 AS THEY CAME TO A STOP THEY WERE BESIEGED BY A CROWD OF BLUE COATED GIRLS IT WAS AFTERNOON RECREATION AND THE WHOLE SCHOOL WAS ABROAD THE WELCOME THAT SHE RECEIVED WOULD HAVE LED AN ONLOOKER TO INFER THAT PATTY HAD BEEN GONE THREE MONTHS INSTEAD OF THREE DAYS SHE AND HER TWO
1578-6379-0004 POSTILIONS DESCENDED AND MARTIN GATHERED UP HIS REINS COME ON YOUSE ALL WHO WANTS A RIDE TO THE STABLES WAS HIS HOSPITABLE INVITATION IT INUNDATED HIM WITH PASSENGERS THEY CROWDED INSIDE TWICE AS MANY AS THE HEARSE WOULD HOLD
1578-6379-0005 THEY SWARMED OVER THE DRIVER'S SEAT AND THE STEPS AND TWO EQUESTRIENNES EVEN PERCHED THEMSELVES ON THE HORSES BACKS WHAT'S THE ADVENTURE DEMANDED CONNY AND PRISCILLA IN A BREATH AS THE CAVALCADE RATTLED OFF PATTY WAVED HER HAND TOWARD THE SUIT CASE

1578-6379-0008 MISS JELLINGS WAS INSISTENT THAT RECREATION SHOULD BE ACTIVELY PURSUED OUT OF DOORS THE TWO COULD EASILY HAVE OBTAINED PERMISSION TO GREET PATTY'S RETURN INSIDE BUT IT WAS THE POLICY OF THE TRIO NEVER TO ASK PERMISSION IN MINOR MATTERS IT WASTED ONE'S CREDIT UNNECESSARILY
1578-6379-0009 PRISCILLA AND CONNY TURNED UPSTAIRS LUGGING THE SUIT CASE BETWEEN THEM WHILE PATTY APPROACHED THE PRINCIPAL'S STUDY TEN MINUTES LATER SHE JOINED HER COMPANIONS IN SEVEN PARADISE ALLEY THEY WERE SITTING ON THE BED THEIR CHINS IN THEIR HANDS
1578-6379-0010 STUDYING THE SUIT CASE PROPPED ON A CHAIR BEFORE THEM WELL THEY INQUIRED IN A BREATH SHE SAYS SHE'S GLAD TO SEE ME BACK AND HOPES I DIDN'T EAT TOO MUCH WEDDING CAKE
1578-6379-0011 THE MAN WITH THE BLACK EYEBROWS AND THE DIMPLE IN HIS CHIN WHO SANG THE FUNNY SONGS THIRD FROM THE END ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE JERMYN HILLIARD JUNIOR PRISCILLA ASKED BREATHLESSLY NOT REALLY CONNY LAID HER HAND ON HER HEART WITH AN EXAGGERATED SIGH

1578-6379-0045 MISSUS TRENT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MISS PATTY WYATT COME TO THE DRAWING ROOM AND I AM TO TAKE THE SUIT CASE DOWN THE GENTLEMAN IS WAITING OH PATTY A GASP WENT AROUND THE ROOM DO YOUR HAIR UP QUICK PRISCILLA CAUGHT PATTY'S TWIN BRAIDS AND WOUND THEM AROUND HER HEAD
1578-6379-0046 WHILE THE OTHERS IN A FLUTTER OF EXCITEMENT THRUST IN THE COAT AND RELOCKED THE SUIT CASE THEY CROWDED AFTER HER IN A BODY AND HUNG OVER THE BANISTERS AT A PERILOUS ANGLE STRAINING THEIR EARS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DRAWING ROOM NOTHING BUT A MURMUR OF VOICES FLOATED UP
1578-6379-0047 PUNCTUATED BY AN OCCASIONAL DEEP BASS LAUGH WHEN THEY HEARD THE FRONT DOOR CLOSE WITH ONE ACCORD THEY INVADED HARRIET GLADDEN'S ROOM WHICH COMMANDED THE WALK AND PRESSED THEIR NOSES AGAINST THE PANE A SHORT THICK SET MAN OF GERMAN BUILD WAS WADDLING TOWARD THE GATE AND THE TROLLEY CAR
1578-6379-0048 THEY GAZED WITH WIDE HORRIFIED EYES AND TURNED WITHOUT A WORD TO MEET PATTY AS SHE TRUDGED UPSTAIRS LUGGING HER ERRANT SUIT CASE A GLANCE TOLD HER THAT THEY HAD SEEN AND DROPPING ON THE TOP STEP SHE LEANED HER HEAD AGAINST THE RAILING AND LAUGHED
1594-135914-0000 IN THIS MISERABLE STATE THEY CAME TO THE FIRST VILLAGE THE PEASANTS WIVES FLOCKED ABOUT THEM AND AS IT APPEARED THROUGH THEIR DISGUISE THAT THEY WERE PEOPLE OF SOME CONDITION ASKED THEM WHAT WAS THE OCCASION OF THEIR TRAVELLING IN A HABIT THAT DID NOT SEEM TO BELONG TO THEM
1594-135914-0001 INSTEAD OF ANSWERING THE QUESTION THEY FELL TO WEEPING WHICH ONLY SERVED TO HEIGHTEN THE CURIOSITY OF THE PEASANTS AND TO MOVE THEIR COMPASSION GANEM'S MOTHER TOLD THEM WHAT SHE AND HER DAUGHTER HAD ENDURED AT WHICH THE GOOD COUNTRYWOMEN WERE SENSIBLY AFFLICTED
1594-135914-0002 AND ENDEAVOURED TO COMFORT THEM THEY TREATED THEM AS WELL AS THEIR POVERTY WOULD PERMIT TOOK OFF THEIR HORSE HAIR SHIFTS WHICH WERE VERY UNEASY TO THEM AND PUT ON THEM OTHERS WHICH THEY GAVE THEM WITH SHOES AND SOMETHING TO COVER THEIR HEADS AND SAVE THEIR HAIR
1594-135914-0003 JALIB AL KOOLLOOB AND HER MOTHER DEPARTED FROM THAT VILLAGE TAKING SHORT JOURNEYS TOWARDS ALEPPO THEY USED AT DUSK TO RETIRE NEAR OR INTO THE MOSQUES WHERE THEY PASSED THE NIGHT ON THE MAT IF THERE WAS ANY
1594-135914-0004 OR ELSE ON THE BARE PAVEMENT AND SOMETIMES RESTED IN THE PUBLIC PLACES APPOINTED FOR THE USE OF TRAVELLERS AS FOR SUSTENANCE THEY DID NOT WANT FOR THEY OFTEN CAME TO PLACES WHERE BREAD BOILED RICE AND OTHER PROVISIONS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL TRAVELLERS WHO DESIRE IT
1594-135914-0005 AT LENGTH THEY CAME TO ALEPPO BUT WOULD NOT STAY THERE AND CONTINUING THEIR JOURNEY TOWARDS THE EUPHRATES CROSSED THE RIVER
1594-135914-0006 THENCE NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THEY HAD ENDURED THEY PROCEEDED TO BAGDAD THAT WAS THE PLACE THEY HAD FIXED THEIR THOUGHTS UPON
1594-135914-0007 BUT THEY HOPED BECAUSE THEY WISHED IT THEIR AFFECTION FOR HIM INCREASING INSTEAD OF DIMINISHING WITH THEIR MISFORTUNES THEIR CONVERSATION WAS GENERALLY ABOUT HIM AND THEY INQUIRED FOR HIM OF ALL THEY MET BUT LET US LEAVE JALIB AL KOOLLOOB AND HER MOTHER
1594-135914-0008 AND RETURN TO FETNAH SHE WAS STILL CONFINED CLOSELY IN THE DARK TOWER SINCE THE DAY THAT HAD BEEN SO FATAL TO GANEM AND HERSELF HOWEVER DISAGREEABLE AS HER PRISON WAS TO HER IT WAS MUCH LESS GRIEVOUS THAN THE THOUGHTS OF GANEM'S MISFORTUNE
1594-135914-0009 THE UNCERTAINTY OF WHOSE FATE WAS A KILLING AFFLICTION THERE WAS SCARCELY A MOMENT IN WHICH SHE DID NOT LAMENT HIM
1594-135914-0010 AND SOMETIMES BY THOSE NIGHT WALKS CAME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN HIS COURT WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE NEVER HAVE REACHED HIS EAR ONE OF THOSE NIGHTS IN HIS WALK HE HAPPENED TO PASS BY THE DARK TOWER AND FANCYING HE HEARD SOMEBODY TALK
1594-135914-0011 STOPS AND DRAWING NEAR THE DOOR TO LISTEN DISTINCTLY HEARD THESE WORDS WHICH FETNAH WHOSE THOUGHTS WERE ALWAYS ON GANEM UTTERED WITH A LOUD VOICE O GANEM TOO UNFORTUNATE GANEM WHERE ARE YOU AT THIS TIME
1594-135914-0012 WHITHER HAS THY CRUEL FATE LED THEE ALAS IT IS I THAT HAVE MADE YOU WRETCHED WHY DID YOU NOT LET ME PERISH MISERABLY RATHER THAN AFFORD ME YOUR GENEROUS RELIEF WHAT MELANCHOLY RETURN HAVE YOU RECEIVED FOR YOUR CARE AND RESPECT
1594-135914-0013 THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL WHO OUGHT TO HAVE REWARDED PERSECUTES YOU AND IN REQUITAL FOR HAVING ALWAYS REGARDED ME AS A PERSON RESERVED FOR HIS BED YOU LOSE YOUR FORTUNE AND ARE OBLIGED TO SEEK FOR SAFETY IN FLIGHT
1594-135914-0014 HOW CAN YOU EXCULPATE YOURSELF WHEN YOU SHALL APPEAR WITH GANEM BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL OF THE SUPREME JUDGE AND THE ANGELS SHALL TESTIFY THE TRUTH BEFORE YOUR FACE ALL THE POWER YOU ARE NOW INVESTED WITH AND WHICH MAKES ALMOST THE WHOLE WORLD TREMBLE
1594-135914-0015 WILL NOT PREVENT YOUR BEING CONDEMNED AND PUNISHED FOR YOUR VIOLENT AND UNJUST PROCEEDINGS HERE FETNAH CEASED HER COMPLAINTS HER SIGHS AND TEARS PUTTING A STOP TO HER UTTERANCE
1594-135914-0016 HE PLAINLY PERCEIVED THAT IF WHAT HE HAD HEARD WAS TRUE HIS FAVOURITE MUST BE INNOCENT AND THAT HE HAD BEEN TOO HASTY IN GIVING SUCH ORDERS AGAINST GANEM AND HIS FAMILY
1594-135914-0017 HE WAS OVERJOYED AT THE THOUGHT FOR HE RESPECTED FETNAH AND HAD BEEN MUCH CONCERNED AT HER DISGRACE THEREFORE FLYING INSTANTLY TO THE TOWER MADAM SAID HE TO THE FAVOURITE WITH SUCH AN AIR AS EXPRESSED HIS SATISFACTION BE PLEASED TO FOLLOW ME
1594-135914-0018 I HOPE YOU WILL NEVER MORE RETURN TO THIS MELANCHOLY ABODE THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL WISHES TO SPEAK WITH YOU AND I DRAW FROM THIS A HAPPY OMEN
1594-135914-0019 SHE PROSTRATED HERSELF BEFORE HIM AND SO CONTINUED HER FACE BATHED IN TEARS
1594-135914-0020 I THINK YOU CHARGE ME WITH VIOLENCE AND INJUSTICE WHO IS HE THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE REGARD AND RESPELL HE HAD FOR ME IS IN A MISERABLE CONDITION SPEAK FREELY
1594-135914-0021 YOU KNOW THE NATURAL GOODNESS OF MY DISPOSITION AND THAT I LOVE TO DO JUSTICE BY THESE WORDS
1594-135914-0022 COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS SAID SHE IF I HAVE LET FALL ANY WORD THAT IS NOT AGREEABLE TO YOUR MAJESTY I MOST HUMBLY BESEECH YOU TO FORGIVE ME BUT HE WHOSE INNOCENCE AND WRETCHED STATE YOU DESIRE TO BE INFORMED OF
1594-135914-0023 IS GANEM THE UNHAPPY SON OF ABOU AYOUB LATE A RICH MERCHANT OF DAMASCUS HE SAVED MY LIFE FROM A GRAVE AND AFFORDED ME A SANCTUARY IN HIS HOUSE
1594-135914-0024 I MUST OWN THAT FROM THE FIRST MOMENT HE SAW ME HE PERHAPS DESIGNED TO DEVOTE HIMSELF TO ME AND CONCEIVED HOPES OF ENGAGING ME TO ADMIT HIS LOVE I GUESSED AT THIS BY THE EAGERNESS WHICH HE SHEWED IN ENTERTAINING ME
1594-135914-0025 AND DOING ME ALL THE GOOD OFFICES I SO MUCH WANTED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I WAS THEN IN BUT AS SOON AS HE HEARD THAT I HAD THE HONOUR TO BELONG TO YOU AH MADAM SAID HE THAT WHICH BELONGS TO THE MASTER IS FORBIDDEN TO THE SLAVE FROM THAT MOMENT
1594-135914-0026 I OWE THIS JUSTICE TO HIS VIRTUE TO DECLARE HIS BEHAVIOUR WAS ALWAYS SUITABLE TO HIS WORDS YOU COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS WELL KNOW WITH WHAT RIGOUR YOU HAVE TREATED HIM AND YOU WILL ANSWER FOR IT BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL OF GOD
1594-135914-0027 I MUST MAKE A CONFESSION WHICH PERHAPS MAY DISPLEASE YOU BUT I BEG PARDON OF YOUR MAJESTY BEFOREHAND SPEAK DAUGHTER SAID HAROON AL RUSHEED I FORGIVE YOU ALL PROVIDED YOU CONCEAL NOTHING FROM ME WELL THEN REPLIED FETNAH
1594-135914-0028 LET ME INFORM YOU THAT GANEM'S RESPECTFUL BEHAVIOUR JOINED TO ALL THE GOOD OFFICES HE DID ME GAINED HIM MY ESTEEM I WENT FURTHER YET YOU KNOW THE TYRANNY OF LOVE I FELT SOME TENDER INCLINATION RISING IN MY BREAST
1594-135914-0029 HE PERCEIVED IT BUT FAR FROM AVAILING HIMSELF OF MY FRAILTY AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FLAME WHICH CONSUMED HIM HE STILL REMAINED STEADY IN HIS DUTY AND ALL THAT HIS PASSION COULD FORCE FROM HIM WERE THE WORDS I HAVE ALREADY REPEATED TO YOUR MAJESTY
1594-135914-0030 THAT WHICH BELONGS TO THE MASTER IS FORBIDDEN TO THE SLAVE THIS INGENUOUS CONFESSION
1594-135914-0031 AND ENLARGING ON THE OBLIGATIONS SHE OWED TO GANEM BUT ABOVE ALL SHE HIGHLY EXTOLLED HIS DISCRETION
1594-135914-0032 WHEN SHE HAD DONE SPEAKING
1594-135914-0033 I BELIEVE ALL YOU HAVE TOLD ME BUT WHY WAS IT SO LONG BEFORE YOU LET ME HEAR FROM YOU WAS THERE ANY NEED OF STAYING A WHOLE MONTH AFTER MY RETURN BEFORE YOU SENT ME WORD WHERE YOU WERE COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS ANSWERED FETNAH
1594-135914-0034 GANEM WENT ABROAD SO VERY SELDOM THAT YOU NEED NOT WONDER WE WERE NOT THE FIRST THAT HEARD OF YOUR RETURN BESIDES GANEM WHO TOOK UPON HIM TO DELIVER THE LETTER I WROTE TO NOURON NIHAR
1594-135914-0035 WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE HE COULD FIND AN OPPORTUNITY OF PUTTING IT INTO HER OWN HANDS IT IS ENOUGH FETNAH
1594-135914-0036 I ACKNOWLEDGE MY FAULT AND WOULD WILLINGLY MAKE AMENDS FOR IT BY HEAPING FAVOURS ON THE YOUNG MERCHANT OF DAMASCUS CONSIDER THEREFORE WHAT I CAN DO FOR HIM ASK WHAT YOU THINK FIT AND I WILL GRANT IT
1594-135914-0037 AND RISING AGAIN SAID COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS AFTER RETURNING YOUR MAJESTY THANKS FOR GANEM I MOST HUMBLY ENTREAT YOU TO CAUSE IT TO BE PUBLISHED THROUGHOUT YOUR DO MINIONS THAT YOU PARDON THE SON OF ABOU AYOUB AND THAT HE MAY SAFELY COME TO YOU
1594-135914-0038 I MUST DO MORE REJOINED THE PRINCE IN REQUITAL FOR HAVING SAVED YOUR LIFE AND THE RESPECT HE HAS STREWN FOR ME TO MAKE AMENDS FOR THE LOSS OF HIS FORTUNE IN SHORT TO REPAIR THE WRONG I HAVE DONE TO HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY
1594-135914-0039 I GIVE HIM TO YOU FOR A HUSBAND
1594-135914-0040 SHE THEN WITHDREW INTO THE APARTMENT SHE HAD OCCUPIED BEFORE HER MELANCHOLY ADVENTURE
1594-135914-0041 SHE SPEND THE WHOLE DAY AND THE THOUSAND PIECES OF GOLD IN GIVING ALMS AT THE MOSQUES AND RETURNED TO THE PALACE IN THE EVENING
1594-135914-0042 THE NEXT DAY SHE TOOK ANOTHER PURSE OF THE SAME VALUE AND IN THE LIKE EQUIPAGE AS THE DAY BEFORE WENT TO THE SQUARE OF THE JEWELLERS SHOPS AND STOPPING AT THE GATEWAY WITHOUT ALIGHTING SENT ONE OF HER BLACK EUNUCHS FOR THE SYNDIC OR CHIEF OF THEM
1594-135914-0043 THE SYNDIC WHO WAS A MOST CHARITABLE MAN AND SPENT ABOVE TWO THIRDS OF HIS INCOME IN RELIEVING POOR STRANGERS SICK OR IN DISTRESS DID NOT MAKE FETNAH WAIT KNOWING BY HER DRESS THAT SHE WAS A LADY BELONGING TO THE PALACE I APPLY MYSELF TO YOU SAID SHE
1594-135914-0044 PUTTING THE PURSE INTO HIS HANDS AS A PERSON WHOSE PIETY IS CELEBRATED THROUGHOUT THE CITY I DESIRE YOU TO DISTRIBUTE THAT GOLD AMONG THE POOR STRANGERS YOU RELIEVE FOR I KNOW YOU MAKE IT YOUR BUSINESS TO ASSIST THOSE WHO APPLY TO YOUR CHARITY
1594-135914-0045 I AM ALSO SATISFIED THAT YOU PREVENT THEIR WANTS AND THAT NOTHING IS MORE GRATEFUL TO YOU THAN TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF RELIEVING THEIR MISERY MADAM ANSWERED THE SYNDIC I SHALL OBEY YOUR COMMANDS WITH PLEASURE BUT IF YOU DESIRE TO EXERCISE YOUR CHARITY IN PERSON
1594-135914-0046 AND WILL BE PLEASED TO STEP TO MY HOUSE
1594-135914-0047 I MET THEM YESTERDAY AS THEY WERE COMING INTO THE CITY THEY WERE IN A DEPLORABLE CONDITION AND IT MOVED ME THE MORE BECAUSE I THOUGHT THEY WERE PERSONS OF RANK THROUGH ALL THE RAGS THAT COVERED THEM NOTWITHSTANDING THE IMPRESSION THE SUN HAS MADE ON THEIR FACES
1594-135914-0048 WHILST SHE HERSELF LED THEM TO OUR WARM BATH AND GAVE THEM CLEAN LINEN
1594-135914-0049 BECAUSE WE WISH TO LET THEM TAKE SOME REST BEFORE WE TROUBLE THEM WITH OUR QUESTIONS FETNAH WITHOUT KNOWING WHY FELT A CURIOSITY TO SEE THEM THE SYNDIC WOULD HAVE CONDUCTED HER TO HIS HOUSE
1594-135914-0050 FOR THEY WERE THE PERSONS THE SYNDIC HAD BEEN SPEAKING OF TO FETNAH THE SYNDIC'S WIFE BEING INFORMED BY THE SLAVE THAT A LADY FROM THE PALACE WAS IN HER HOUSE WAS HASTENING TO MEET HER BUT FETNAH WHO HAD FOLLOWED THE SLAVE DID NOT GIVE HER TIME
1594-135914-0051 ON HER COMING INTO THE CHAMBER THE SYNDIC'S WIFE PROSTRATED HERSELF BEFORE HER
1594-135914-0052 FETNAH RAISED HER UP AND SAID MY GOOD LADY
1594-135914-0053 MADAM ANSWERED THE SYNDIC'S WIFE THEY LIE IN THOSE BEDS YOU SEE BY EACH OTHER
1594-135914-0054 GOOD WOMAN SAID SHE I COME TO OFFER YOU MY ASSISTANCE I HAVE CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THIS CITY AND MAY BE OF SERVICE TO YOU AND YOUR COMPANION MADAM ANSWERED GANEM'S MOTHER
1594-135914-0055 THAT FETNAH AND THE SYNDIC'S WIFE COULD NOT FORBEAR LETTING FALL SOME TEARS
1594-135914-0056 SAID TO GANEM'S MOTHER BE SO KIND AS TO TELL US YOUR MISFORTUNES AND RECOUNT YOUR STORY YOU CANNOT MAKE THE RELATION TO ANY PERSONS BETTER DISPOSED TO USE ALL POSSIBLE MEANS TO COMFORT YOU
1594-135914-0057 MADAM REPLIED ABOU AYOUB'S DISCONSOLATE WIDOW A FAVOURITE OF THE COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS A LADY WHOSE NAME IS FETNAH IS THE OCCASION OF ALL OUR MISFORTUNES THESE WORDS WERE LIKE A THUNDERBOLT TO THE FAVOURITE
1594-135914-0058 BUT SUPPRESSING HER AGITATION AND CONCERN SHE SUFFERED GANEM'S MOTHER TO PROCEED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER
1594-135914-0059 I HAD A SON CALLED GANEM WHO COMING TO TRADE AT BAGDAD HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF CARRYING OFF FETNAH
1594-135914-0060 AND THEN TO BANISH US OUT OF SYRIA FOR EVER BUT HOW UNWORTHY SOEVER OUR USAGE HAS BEEN
1594-135914-0061 WHAT A PLEASURE WOULD IT BE FOR HIS SISTER AND ME TO SEE HIM AGAIN EMBRACING HIM WE SHOULD FORGET THE LOSS OF OUR PROPERTY AND ALL THE EVILS WE HAVE SUFFERED ON HIS ACCOUNT ALAS
1594-135914-0062 NO DOUBT OF IT SAID FETNAH INTERRUPTING HER THERE HE IS NO MORE GUILTY THAN YOU ARE I CAN ASSURE YOU OF HIS INNOCENCE FOR I AM THAT VERY FETNAH YOU SO MUCH COMPLAIN OF WHO THROUGH SOME FATALITY IN MY STARS
1594-135914-0063 HAVE OCCASIONED YOU SO MANY MISFORTUNES TO ME YOU MUST IMPUTE THE LOSS OF YOUR SON IF HE IS NO MORE BUT IF I HAVE OCCASIONED YOUR MISFORTUNE I CAN IN SOME MEASURE RELIEVE IT
1594-135914-0064 AND DOUBT NOT HE WILL DO YOU AS MUCH GOOD AS HE HAS DONE YOU INJURY YOU ARE NO LONGER HIS ENEMIES HE WAITS FOR GANEM TO REQUITE THE SERVICE HE HAS DONE ME BY UNITING OUR FORTUNES HE GIVES ME TO HIM FOR HIS CONSORT
1594-135914-0065 THEREFORE LOOK ON ME AS YOUR DAUGHTER AND PERMIT ME TO VOW ETERNAL DUTY AND AFFECTION HAVING SO SAID SHE BOWED DOWN ON GANEM'S MOTHER WHO WAS SO ASTONISHED THAT SHE COULD RETURN NO ANSWER
1594-135914-0066 FETNAH HELD HER LONG IN HER ARMS AND ONLY LEFT HER TO EMBRACE THE DAUGHTER WHO SITTING UP
1594-135914-0067 THE WEALTH GANEM HAD IN THIS CITY IS NOT LOST IT IS IN MY APARTMENT IN THE PALACE BUT I KNOW ALL THE TREASURE OF THE WORLD CANNOT COMFORT YOU WITHOUT GANEM IF I MAY JUDGE OF YOU BY MYSELF BLOOD IS NO LESS POWERFUL THAN LOVE IN GREAT MINDS
1594-135914-0068 BUT WHY SHOULD WE DESPAIR OF SEEING HIM AGAIN WE SHALL FIND HIM THE HAPPINESS OF MEETING WITH YOU MAKES ME CONCEIVE FRESH HOPES PERHAPS THIS IS THE LAST DAY OF YOUR SUFFERINGS AND THE BEGINNING OF A GREATER FELICITY THAN YOU ENJOYED IN DAMASCUS
1594-135914-0069 WHEN GANEM WAS WITH YOU FETNAH WOULD HAVE PROCEEDED BUT THE SYNDIC OF THE JEWELLERS COMING IN INTERRUPTED HER MADAM SAID HE TO HER I COME FROM SEEING A VERY MOVING OBJECT IT IS A YOUNG MAN WHOM A CAMEL DRIVER HAD JUST CARRIED TO AN HOSPITAL
1594-135914-0070 HE WAS BOUND WITH CORDS ON A CAMEL BECAUSE HE HAD NOT STRENGTH ENOUGH TO SIT THEY HAD ALREADY UNBOUND HIM AND WERE CARRYING HIM INTO THE HOSPITAL WHEN I HAPPENED TO PASS BY I WENT UP TO THE YOUNG MAN VIEWED HIM ATTENTIVELY
1594-135914-0071 AND FANCIED HIS COUNTENANCE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER UNKNOWN TO ME I ASKED HIM SOME QUESTIONS CONCERNING HIS FAMILY AND HIS COUNTRY BUT ALL THE ANSWERS I COULD GET WERE SIGHS AND TEARS I TOOK PITY ON HIM
1594-135914-0072 PERCEIVED THAT HE HAD NEED TO HAVE PARTICULAR CARE TAKEN OF HIM I WOULD NOT PERMIT HIM TO BE PUT INTO THE HOSPITAL FOR I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR WAY OF MANAGING THE SICK AND AM SENSIBLE OF THE INCAPACITY OF THE PHYSICIANS
1594-135914-0073 I HAVE CAUSED HIM TO BE BROUGHT TO MY OWN HOUSE BY MY SLAVES AND THEY ARE NOW IN A PRIVATE ROOM WHERE I PLACED HIM PUTTING ON SOME OF MY OWN LINEN AND TREATING HIM AS THEY WOULD DO MYSELF FETNAH'S HEART BEAT AT THESE WORDS OF THE JEWELLER
1594-135914-0074 AND SHE FELT A SUDDEN EMOTION FOR WHICH SHE COULD NOT ACCOUNT SHEW ME SAID SHE TO THE SYNDIC INTO THE SICK MAN'S ROOM I SHOULD BE GLAD TO SEE HIM THE SYNDIC CONDUCTED HER AND WHILST SHE WAS GOING THITHER
1594-135914-0075 WHOSE EYES WERE CLOSED HIS COUNTENANCE PALE DISFIGURED AND BATHED IN TEARS SHE GAZED EARNESTLY ON HIM HER HEART BEAT AND SHE FANCIED SHE BEHELD GANEM BUT YET SHE WOULD NOT BELIEVE HER EYES
1594-135914-0076 THOUGH SHE FOUND SOMETHING OF GANEM IN THE OBJETS SHE BEHELD YET IN OTHER RESPECTS HE APPEARED SO DIFFERENT THAT SHE DURST NOT IMAGINE IT WAS HE THAT LAY BEFORE HER UNABLE HOWEVER TO WITHSTAND THE EARNEST DESIRE OF BEING SATISFIED
1594-135914-0077 GANEM SAID SHE WITH A TREMBLING VOICE IS IT YOU I BEHOLD HAVING SPOKEN THESE WORDS SHE STOPPED TO GIVE THE YOUNG MAN TIME TO ANSWER BUT OBSERVING THAT HE SEEMED INSENSIBLE ALAS GANEM ADDED SHE
1594-135914-0078 IT IS NOT YOU THAT I ADDRESS MY IMAGINATION BEING OVERCHARGED WITH YOUR IMAGE HAS GIVEN TO A STRANGER A DECEITFUL RESEMBLANCE
1594-135914-0079 HOWEVER INDISPOSED WOULD KNOW THE VOICE OF FETNAH AT THE NAME OF FETNAH GANEM FOR IT WAS REALLY HE
1594-135914-0080 AH MADAM SAID HE BY WHAT MIRACLE HE COULD SAY NO MORE SUCH A SUDDEN TRANSPORT OF JOY SEIZED HIM THAT HE FAINTED AWAY FETNAH AND THE SYNDIC DID ALL THEY COULD TO BRING HIM TO HIMSELF
1594-135914-0081 BUT AS SOON AS THEY PERCEIVED HE BEGAN TO REVIVE THE SYNDIC DESIRED THE LADY TO WITHDRAW LEST THE SIGHT OF HER SHOULD HEIGHTEN HIS DISORDER THE YOUNG MAN HAVING RECOVERED LOOKED ALL AROUND AND NOT SEEING WHAT HE SOUGHT EXCLAIMED
1594-135914-0082 WHAT IS BECOME OF YOU CHARMING FETNAH DID YOU REALLY APPEAR BEFORE MY EYES OR WAS IT ONLY AN ILLUSION NO SIR SAID THE SYNDIC IT WAS NO ILLUSION IT WAS I THAT CAUSED THE LADY TO WITHDRAW
1594-135914-0083 BUT YOU SHALL SEE HER AGAIN AS SOON AS YOU ARE IN A CONDITION TO BEAR THE INTERVIEW YOU NOW STAND IN NEED OF REST AND NOTHING OUGHT TO OBSTRUCT YOUR TAKING IT THE SITUATION OF YOUR AFFAIRS IS ALTERED SINCE YOU ARE AS I SUPPOSE THAT GANEM
1594-135914-0084 IN FAVOUR OF WHOM THE COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS HAS CAUSED A PROCLAMATION TO BE MADE IN BAGDAD DECLARING THAT HE FORGIVES HIM WHAT IS PASSED BE SATISFIED FOR THE PRESENT WITH KNOWING SO MUCH
1594-135914-0085 THE LADY WHO JUST NOW SPOKE TO YOU WILL ACQUAINT YOU WITH THE REST THEREFORE THINK OF NOTHING BUT RECOVERING YOUR HEALTH I WILL CONTRIBUTE ALL IN MY POWER TOWARDS IT HAVING SPOKE THESE WORDS HE LEFT GANEM TO TAKE HIS REST
1594-135914-0086 EXHAUSTED BY HARD LIVING AND TOIL
1594-135914-0087 THERE WAS NO OCCASION FOR THE SYNDIC'S SAYING ANY MORE TO GANEM'S MOTHER AS SOON AS SHE WAS TOLD THAT SHE COULD NOT CONVERSE WITH HER SON WITHOUT HAZARDING HIS LIFE SHE CEASED INSISTING TO GO AND SEE HIM
1594-135914-0088 FETNAH THEN SAID LET US BLESS HEAVEN FOR HAVING BROUGHT US ALL TOGETHER
1594-135914-0089 AND TOMORROW MORNING I WILL RETURN TO YOU THIS SAID SHE EMBRACED THE MOTHER AND THE DAUGHTER AND WENT AWAY AS SOON AS SHE CAME TO THE PALACE
1594-135914-0090 WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY GRANTED AND BEING BROUGHT INTO THE PRINCE'S CLOSET WHERE HE WAS ALONE SHE PROSTRATED HERSELF AT HIS FEET WITH HER FACE ON THE GROUND ACCORDING TO CUSTOM HE COMMANDED HER TO RISE AND HAVING MADE HER SIT DOWN ASKED WHETHER SHE HAD HEARD ANY NEWS OF GANEM
1594-135914-0091 COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS SAID SHE I HAVE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL THAT I HAVE FOUND HIM AND ALSO HIS MOTHER AND SISTER
1594-135914-0092 AND SHE SATISFIED HIS INQUIRIES SAYING SO MANY THINGS IN COMMENDATION OF GANEM'S MOTHER AND SISTER HE DESIRED TO SEE THEM AS WELL AS THE YOUNG MERCHANT THOUGH HAROON AL RUSHEED WAS PASSIONATE AND IN HIS HEAT SOMETIMES GUILTY OF CRUEL ACTIONS
1594-135914-0093 HAVING THEREFORE NO LONGER CAUSE TO DOUBT BUT THAT HE HAD UNJUSTLY PERSECUTED GANEM AND HIS FAMILY AND HAD PUBLICLY WRONGED THEM HE RESOLVED TO MAKE THEM PUBLIC SATISFACTION
1594-135914-0094 THAT YOUR SEARCH HAS PROVED SO SUCCESSFUL IT IS A REAL SATISFACTION TO ME NOT SO MUCH FOR YOUR SAKE AS FOR MY OWN I WILL KEEP THE PROMISE I HAVE MADE YOU YOU SHALL MARRY GANEM AND I HERE DECLARE YOU ARE NO LONGER MY SLAVE YOU ARE FREE
1594-135914-0095 GO BACK TO THAT YOUNG MERCHANT AND AS SOON AS HE HAS RECOVERED HIS HEALTH YOU SHALL BRING HIM TO ME WITH HIS MOTHER AND SISTER THE NEXT MORNING EARLY FETNAH REPAIRED TO THE SYNDIC OF THE JEWELLERS BEING IMPATIENT TO HEAR OF GANEM'S HEALTH AND TELL THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER THE GOOD NEWS SHE HAD FOR THEM
1594-135914-0096 WHO TOLD HER THAT GANEM HAD RESTED WELL THAT NIGHT AND THAT HIS DISORDER PROCEEDING ALTOGETHER FROM MELANCHOLY THE CAUSE BEING REMOVED HE WOULD SOON RECOVER HIS HEALTH
1594-135914-0097 REST AND THE GOOD MEDICINES HE HAD TAKEN BUT ABOVE ALL THE DIFFERENT SITUATION OF HIS MIND HAD WROUGHT SO GOOD AN EFFECT THAT THE SYNDIC THOUGHT HE MIGHT WITHOUT DANGER SEE HIS MOTHER HIS SISTER AND HIS MISTRESS PROVIDED HE WAS PREPARED TO RECEIVE THEM
1594-135914-0098 BECAUSE THERE WAS GROUND TO FEAR THAT NOT KNOWING HIS MOTHER AND SISTER WERE AT BAGDAD THE SIGHT OF THEM MIGHT OCCASION TOO GREAT SURPRISE AND JOY IT WAS THEREFORE RESOLVED THAT FETNAH SHOULD FIRST GO ALONE INTO GANEM'S CHAMBER
1594-135914-0099 WHEN SHE THOUGHT IT WAS PROPER MATTERS BEING SO ORDERED THE SYNDIC ANNOUNCED FETNAH'S COMING TO THE SICK MAN WHO WAS SO TRANSPORTED TO SEE HER THAT HE WAS AGAIN NEAR FAINTING AWAY WELL GANEM SAID SHE DRAWING NEAR TO HIS BED
1594-135914-0100 YOU HAVE AGAIN FOUND YOUR FETNAH WHOM YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD LOST FOR EVER
1594-135914-0101 WHAT MIRACLE HAS RESTORED YOU TO MY SIGHT
1594-135914-0102 HE HAS DOUBTLESS LISTENED TO YOU YOU HAVE DISPELLED HIS JEALOUSY AND HE HAS RESTORED YOU TO HIS FAVOUR YES MY DEAR GANEM ANSWERED FETNAH I HAVE CLEARED MYSELF BEFORE THE COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS WHO TO MAKE AMENDS FOR THE WRONG HE HAS DONE YOU
1594-135914-0103 BEAUTIFUL FETNAH MAY I GIVE CREDIT TO WHAT YOU TELL ME
1594-135914-0104 NOTHING IS MORE CERTAIN ANSWERED THE LADY
1594-135914-0105 WHO BEFORE CAUSED SEARCH TO BE MADE FOR YOU TO TAKE AWAY YOUR LIFE AND WHO IN HIS FURY CAUSED YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR SISTER TO SUFFER A THOUSAND INDIGNITIES DESIRES NOW TO SEE YOU THAT HE MAY REWARD THE RESPECT YOU HAD FOR HIM
1594-135914-0106 AND THERE IS NO QUESTION BUT THAT HE WILL LOAD YOUR FAMILY WITH FAVOURS
1594-135914-0107 AND HE COULD NOT FORBEAR LETTING FALL SOME TEARS AT THE RELATION NOTWITHSTANDING THE THOUGHTS WHICH AROSE IN HIS MIND AT THE PROSPECT OF BEING MARRIED TO HIS MISTRESS BUT WHEN FETNAH INFORMED HIM THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY IN BAGDAD AND IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HIM
1594-135914-0108 HE APPEARED SO IMPATIENT TO SEE THEM THAT THE FAVOURITE COULD NO LONGER DEFER GIVING HIM THE SATISFACTION AND ACCORDINGLY CALLED THEM IN THEY WERE AT THE DOOR WAITING FOR THAT MOMENT THEY ENTERED WENT UP TO GANEM AND EMBRACING HIM IN THEIR TURNS
1594-135914-0109 THE SYNDIC HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE WERE SO MOVED AT THE SPECTACLE THAT THEY COULD NOT FORBEAR WEEPING NOR SUFFICIENTLY ADMIRE THE SECRET WORKINGS OF PROVIDENCE WHICH HAD BROUGHT TOGETHER INTO THEIR HOUSE FOUR PERSONS WHOM FORTUNE HAD SO CRUELLY PERSECUTED
1594-135914-0110 WHEN THEY HAD DRIED UP THEIR TEARS GANEM DREW THEM AFRESH BY THE RECITAL OF WHAT HE HAD SUFFERED FROM THE DAY HE LEFT FETNAH TILL THE MOMENT THE SYNDIC BROUGHT HIM TO HIS HOUSE HE TOLD THEM THAT HAVING TAKEN REFUGE IN A SMALL VILLAGE HE THERE FELL SICK
1594-135914-0111 THAT SOME CHARITABLE PEASANTS HAD TAKEN CARE OF HIM BUT FINDING HE DID NOT RECOVER A CAMEL DRIVER HAD UNDERTAKEN TO CARRY HIM TO THE HOSPITAL AT BAGDAD
1594-135914-0112 AND HOW SHE HAD CLEARED HERSELF IN CONCLUSION WHEN THEY HAD RELATED WHAT ACCIDENTS HAD BEFALLEN THEM FETNAH SAID LET US BLESS HEAVEN WHICH HAS BROUGHT US ALL TOGETHER AGAIN AND LET US THINK OF NOTHING BUT THE HAPPINESS THAT AWAITS US
1594-135914-0113 AS SOON AS GANEM HAS RECOVERED HIS HEALTH
1594-135914-0114 BUT I WILL GO AND MAKE SOME PROVISION FOR THEM THIS SAID SHE WENT TO THE PALACE AND SOON RETURNED WITH A PURSE CONTAINING A THOUSAND PIECES OF GOLD WHICH SHE DELIVERED TO THE SYNDIC DESIRING HIM TO BUY APPAREL FOR THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER

1594-135914-0119 WHICH HE MANAGED VERY GRACEFULLY THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER WERE MOUNTED ON MULES BELONGING TO THE PALACE AND WHILST FETNAH ON ANOTHER MULE LED THEM BY A BYE WAY TO THE PRINCE'S COURT JAAFFIER CONDUCTED GANEM AND BROUGHT HIM INTO THE HALL OF AUDIENCE
1594-135914-0120 ARABS PERSIANS EGYPTIANS AFRICANS AND SYRIANS OF HIS OWN DOMINIONS NOT TO MENTION STRANGERS WHEN THE VIZIER HAD CONDUCTED GANEM TO THE FOOT OF THE THRONE
1594-135914-0121 I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU AND DESIRE TO HEAR FROM YOUR OWN MOUTH WHERE YOU FOUND MY FAVOURITE AND ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR HER GANEM OBEYED
1594-135914-0122 AFTER WHICH HE SAID TO HIM GANEM I WILL HAVE YOU LIVE IN MY COURT COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS ANSWERED THE YOUNG MERCHANT A SLAVE HAS NO WILL BUT HIS MASTER'S ON WHOM HIS LIFE AND FORTUNE DEPEND

1624-142933-0007 RETORTED PETER BUT YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME WHO ROSEBREAST IS THE GROSBEAK OF COURSE STUPID SPUTTERED JENNY IF YOU DON'T KNOW ROSEBREAST THE GROSBEAK PETER RABBIT YOU CERTAINLY MUST HAVE BEEN BLIND AND DEAF EVER SINCE YOU WERE BORN
1624-142933-0008 LISTEN TO THAT JUST LISTEN TO THAT SONG PETER LISTENED THERE WERE MANY SONGS FOR IT WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL MORNING AND ALL THE SINGERS OF THE OLD ORCHARD WERE POURING OUT THE JOY THAT WAS WITHIN THEM
1624-142933-0009 ONE SONG WAS A LITTLE LOUDER AND CLEARER THAN THE OTHERS BECAUSE IT CAME FROM A TREE VERY CLOSE AT HAND THE VERY TREE FROM WHICH THOSE SQUEAKY NOTES HAD COME JUST A FEW MINUTES BEFORE PETER SUSPECTED THAT THAT MUST BE THE SONG JENNY WREN MEANT HE LOOKED PUZZLED
1624-142933-0010 HE WAS PUZZLED DO YOU MEAN WELCOME ROBIN'S SONG HE ASKED RATHER SHEEPISHLY FOR HE HAD A FEELING THAT HE WOULD BE THE VICTIM OF JENNY WREN'S SHARP TONGUE NO I DON'T MEAN WELCOME ROBIN'S SONG SNAPPED JENNY
1624-142933-0011 WHAT GOOD ARE A PAIR OF LONG EARS IF THEY CAN'T TELL ONE SONG FROM ANOTHER THAT SONG MAY SOUND SOMETHING LIKE WELCOME ROBIN'S BUT IF YOUR EARS WERE GOOD FOR ANYTHING AT ALL YOU'D KNOW RIGHT AWAY THAT THAT ISN'T WELCOME ROBIN SINGING
1624-142933-0012 THAT'S A BETTER SONG THAN WELCOME ROBIN'S WELCOME ROBIN'S SONG IS ONE OF GOOD CHEER BUT THIS ONE IS OF PURE HAPPINESS I WOULDN'T HAVE A PAIR OF EARS LIKE YOURS FOR ANYTHING IN THE WORLD PETER RABBIT
1624-142933-0013 PETER LAUGHED RIGHT OUT AS HE TRIED TO PICTURE TO HIMSELF JENNY WREN WITH A PAIR OF LONG EARS LIKE HIS WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT DEMANDED JENNY CROSSLY DON'T YOU DARE LAUGH AT ME
1624-142933-0014 IF THERE IS ANY ONE THING I CAN'T STAND IT IS BEING LAUGHED AT I WASN'T LAUGHING AT YOU REPLIED PETER VERY MEEKLY I WAS JUST LAUGHING AT THE THOUGHT OF HOW FUNNY YOU WOULD LOOK WITH A PAIR OF LONG EARS LIKE MINE
1624-142933-0015 NOW YOU SPEAK OF IT JENNY THAT SONG IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WELCOME ROBIN'S OF COURSE IT IS RETORTED JENNY THAT IS ROSEBREAST SINGING UP THERE AND THERE HE IS RIGHT IN THE TOP OF THAT TREE
1624-142933-0016 ISN'T HE HANDSOME PETER LOOKED UP TO SEE A BIRD A LITTLE SMALLER THAN WELCOME ROBIN HIS HEAD THROAT AND BACK WERE BLACK HIS WINGS WERE BLACK WITH PATCHES OF WHITE ON THEM
1624-142933-0017 BUT IT WAS HIS BREAST THAT MADE PETER CATCH HIS BREATH WITH A LITTLE GASP OF ADMIRATION FOR THAT BREAST WAS A BEAUTIFUL ROSE RED THE REST OF HIM UNDERNEATH WAS WHITE IT WAS ROSEBREAST THE GROSBEAK ISN'T HE LOVELY
1624-142933-0018 CRIED PETER AND ADDED IN THE NEXT BREATH WHO IS THAT WITH HIM MISSUS GROSBEAK OF COURSE WHO ELSE WOULD IT BE SPUTTERED JENNY RATHER CROSSLY FOR SHE WAS STILL A LITTLE PUT OUT BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN LAUGHED AT
1624-142933-0019 SAID PETER SHE DOESN'T LOOK THE LEAST BIT LIKE HIM THIS WAS QUITE TRUE THERE WAS NO BEAUTIFUL ROSE COLOR ABOUT MISSUS GROSBEAK SHE WAS DRESSED CHIEFLY IN BROWN AND GRAYISH COLORS WITH A LITTLE BUFF HERE AND THERE AND WITH DARK STREAKS ON HER BREAST
1624-142933-0020 OVER EACH EYE WAS A WHITISH LINE ALTOGETHER SHE LOOKED MORE AS IF SHE MIGHT BE A BIG MEMBER OF THE SPARROW FAMILY THAN THE WIFE OF HANDSOME ROSEBREAST
1624-142933-0021 WHILE ROSEBREAST SANG MISSUS GROSBEAK WAS VERY BUSILY PICKING BUDS AND BLOSSOMS FROM THE TREE WHAT IS SHE DOING THAT FOR INQUIRED PETER FOR THE SAME REASON THAT YOU BITE OFF SWEET CLOVER BLOSSOMS AND LEAVES
1624-142933-0022 REPLIED JENNY WREN TARTLY DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT THEY LIVE ON BUDS AND BLOSSOMS CRIED PETER I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING TUT TUT TUT TUT TUT YOU CAN ASK MORE SILLY QUESTIONS THAN ANYBODY OF MY ACQUAINTANCE RETORTED JENNY WREN
1624-142933-0023 OF COURSE THEY DON'T LIVE ON BUDS AND BLOSSOMS IF THEY DID THEY WOULD SOON STARVE TO DEATH FOR BUDS AND BLOSSOMS DON'T LAST LONG THEY EAT A FEW JUST FOR VARIETY BUT THEY LIVE MOSTLY ON BUGS AND INSECTS
1624-142933-0024 YOU ASK FARMER BROWN'S BOY WHO HELPS HIM MOST IN HIS POTATO PATCH AND HE'LL TELL YOU IT'S THE GROSBEAKS THEY CERTAINLY DO LOVE POTATO BUGS THEY EAT SOME FRUIT BUT ON THE WHOLE THEY ARE ABOUT AS USEFUL AROUND A GARDEN AS ANY ONE I KNOW
1624-142933-0025 NOW RUN ALONG PETER RABBIT AND DON'T BOTHER ME ANY MORE SEEING FARMER BROWN'S BOY COMING THROUGH THE OLD ORCHARD PETER DECIDED THAT IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR HIM TO DEPART SO HE SCAMPERED FOR THE GREEN FOREST LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP
1624-142933-0026 JUST WITHIN THE EDGE OF THE GREEN FOREST HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF SOMETHING WHICH FOR THE TIME BEING PUT ALL THOUGHT OF FARMER BROWN'S BOY OUT OF HIS HEAD FLUTTERING ON THE GROUND WAS A BIRD THAN WHOM NOT EVEN GLORY THE CARDINAL WAS MORE BEAUTIFUL
1624-142933-0027 IT WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF REDWING THE BLACKBIRD WINGS AND TAIL WERE PURE BLACK AND ALL THE REST WAS A BEAUTIFUL SCARLET IT WAS REDCOAT THE TANAGER AT FIRST PETER HAD EYES ONLY FOR THE WONDERFUL BEAUTY OF REDCOAT
1624-142933-0028 NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SEEN REDCOAT SO CLOSE AT HAND THEN QUITE SUDDENLY IT CAME OVER PETER THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH REDCOAT AND HE HURRIED FORWARD TO SEE WHAT THE TROUBLE MIGHT BE REDCOAT HEARD THE RUSTLE OF PETER'S FEET AMONG THE DRY LEAVES
1624-142933-0029 BUT HE COULD NOT GET OFF THE GROUND WHAT IS IT REDCOAT HAS SOMETHING HAPPENED TO YOU IT IS JUST PETER RABBIT YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO FEAR FROM ME CRIED PETER THE LOOK OF TERROR WHICH HAD BEEN IN THE EYES OF REDCOAT DIED OUT
1624-142933-0030 AND HE STOPPED FLUTTERING AND SIMPLY LAY PANTING OH PETER HE GASPED YOU DON'T KNOW HOW GLAD I AM THAT IT IS ONLY YOU I'VE HAD A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM TO DO
1624-142933-0031 I CAN'T FLY AND IF I HAVE TO STAY ON THE GROUND SOME ENEMY WILL BE SURE TO GET ME WHAT SHALL I DO PETER WHAT SHALL I DO RIGHT AWAY PETER WAS FULL OF SYMPATHY
1624-142933-0032 WHAT KIND OF AN ACCIDENT WAS IT REDCOAT AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN HE ASKED BROADWING THE HAWK TRIED TO CATCH ME
1624-142933-0033 AND DID NOT SEE JUST WHERE I WAS GOING I STRUCK A SHARP POINTED DEAD TWIG AND DROVE IT RIGHT THROUGH MY RIGHT WING REDCOAT HELD UP HIS RIGHT WING AND SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS A LITTLE STICK PROJECTING FROM BOTH SIDES CLOSE UP TO THE SHOULDER
1624-142933-0034 THE WING WAS BLEEDING A LITTLE OH DEAR WHATEVER SHALL I DO PETER RABBIT
1624-142933-0035 SOBBED REDCOAT DOES IT PAIN YOU DREADFULLY ASKED PETER REDCOAT NODDED BUT I DON'T MIND THE PAIN HE HASTENED TO SAY IT IS THE THOUGHT OF WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO ME
1624-142933-0036 POOR REDCOAT WITH THE OLD LOOK OF TERROR IN HIS EYES FLUTTERED ALONG TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING UNDER WHICH TO HIDE BUT THERE WAS NOTHING UNDER WHICH HE COULD CRAWL AND THERE WAS NO HIDING THAT WONDERFUL RED COAT
1624-142933-0037 PETER HEARD THE SOUND OF HEAVY FOOTSTEPS AND LOOKING BACK SAW THAT FARMER BROWN'S BOY WAS COMING DON'T BE AFRAID REDCOAT HE WHISPERED IT'S FARMER BROWN'S BOY AND I'M SURE HE WON'T HURT YOU PERHAPS HE CAN HELP YOU
1624-142933-0038 THEN PETER SCAMPERED OFF FOR A SHORT DISTANCE AND SAT UP TO WATCH WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
1624-142933-0039 NO ONE WITH ANY EYES AT ALL COULD HAVE HELPED SEEING HIM BECAUSE OF THAT WONDERFUL SCARLET COAT HE SAW TOO BY THE WAY REDCOAT WAS ACTING THAT HE WAS IN GREAT TROUBLE AS FARMER BROWN'S BOY DREW NEAR AND REDCOAT SAW THAT HE WAS DISCOVERED
1624-142933-0040 HE TRIED HIS HARDEST TO FLUTTER AWAY FARMER BROWN'S BOY UNDERSTOOD INSTANTLY THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH ONE WING AND RUNNING FORWARD HE CAUGHT REDCOAT YOU POOR LITTLE THING
1624-142933-0041 SAID FARMER BROWN'S BOY SOFTLY AS HE SAW THE CRUEL TWIG STICKING THROUGH REDCOATS SHOULDER
1624-142933-0042 CONTINUED FARMER BROWN'S BOY STROKING REDCOAT EVER SO GENTLY SOMEHOW AT THAT GENTLE TOUCH REDCOAT LOST MUCH OF HIS FEAR AND A LITTLE HOPE SPRANG IN HIS HEART
1624-142933-0043 FARMER BROWN'S BOY TOOK OUT HIS KNIFE AND CAREFULLY CUT OFF THE TWIG ON THE UPPER SIDE OF THE WING THEN DOING HIS BEST TO BE CAREFUL AND TO HURT AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE HE WORKED THE OTHER PART OF THE TWIG OUT FROM THE UNDER SIDE
1624-142933-0044 CAREFULLY HE EXAMINED THE WING TO SEE IF ANY BONES WERE BROKEN NONE WERE AND AFTER HOLDING REDCOAT A FEW MINUTES HE CAREFULLY SET HIM UP IN A TREE AND WITHDREW A SHORT DISTANCE REDCOAT HOPPED FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH
1624-142933-0045 UNTIL HE WAS HALFWAY UP THE TREE THEN HE SAT THERE FOR SOME TIME AS IF FEARFUL OF TRYING THAT INJURED WING MEANWHILE MISSUS TANAGER CAME AND FUSSED ABOUT HIM AND TALKED TO HIM AND COAXED HIM AND MADE AS MUCH OF HIM AS IF HE WERE A BABY
1624-142933-0046 FROM TREE TO TREE HE FLEW
1624-168623-0000 THE MOMENT HAS ARRIVED FOR MAKING THE CIRCUIT OF THIS COUPLE AND CONSIDERING IT UNDER ALL ITS ASPECTS THENARDIER HAD JUST PASSED HIS FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY MADAME THENARDIER WAS APPROACHING HER FORTIES WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO FIFTY IN A WOMAN
1624-168623-0001 SO THAT THERE EXISTED A BALANCE OF AGE BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE OUR READERS HAVE POSSIBLY PRESERVED SOME RECOLLECTION OF THIS THENARDIER WOMAN EVER SINCE HER FIRST APPEARANCE TALL BLOND RED FAT ANGULAR SQUARE
1624-168623-0002 ENORMOUS AND AGILE SHE BELONGED AS WE HAVE SAID TO THE RACE OF THOSE COLOSSAL WILD WOMEN WHO CONTORT THEMSELVES AT FAIRS WITH PAVING STONES HANGING FROM THEIR HAIR SHE DID EVERYTHING ABOUT THE HOUSE
1624-168623-0003 MADE THE BEDS DID THE WASHING THE COOKING AND EVERYTHING ELSE COSETTE WAS HER ONLY SERVANT A MOUSE IN THE SERVICE OF AN ELEPHANT EVERYTHING TREMBLED AT THE SOUND OF HER VOICE WINDOW PANES FURNITURE AND PEOPLE
1624-168623-0004 HER BIG FACE DOTTED WITH RED BLOTCHES PRESENTED THE APPEARANCE OF A SKIMMER SHE HAD A BEARD SHE WAS AN IDEAL MARKET PORTER DRESSED IN WOMAN'S CLOTHES SHE SWORE SPLENDIDLY
1624-168623-0005 SHE BOASTED OF BEING ABLE TO CRACK A NUT WITH ONE BLOW OF HER FIST EXCEPT FOR THE ROMANCES WHICH SHE HAD READ AND WHICH MADE THE AFFECTED LADY PEEP THROUGH THE OGRESS AT TIMES IN A VERY QUEER WAY THE IDEA WOULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED TO ANY ONE TO SAY OF HER
1624-168623-0006 THAT IS A WOMAN THIS THENARDIER FEMALE WAS LIKE THE PRODUCT OF A WENCH ENGRAFTED ON A FISHWIFE WHEN ONE HEARD HER SPEAK ONE SAID THAT IS A GENDARME WHEN ONE SAW HER DRINK ONE SAID THAT IS A CARTER
1624-168623-0007 WHEN ONE SAW HER HANDLE COSETTE ONE SAID THAT IS THE HANGMAN ONE OF HER TEETH PROJECTED WHEN HER FACE WAS IN REPOSE THENARDIER WAS A SMALL THIN PALE ANGULAR BONY FEEBLE MAN
1624-168623-0008 HIS CUNNING BEGAN HERE HE SMILED HABITUALLY BY WAY OF PRECAUTION AND WAS ALMOST POLITE TO EVERYBODY EVEN TO THE BEGGAR TO WHOM HE REFUSED HALF A FARTHING HE HAD THE GLANCE OF A POLE CAT AND THE BEARING OF A MAN OF LETTERS
1624-168623-0009 HE GREATLY RESEMBLED THE PORTRAITS OF THE ABBE DELILLE HIS COQUETRY CONSISTED IN DRINKING WITH THE CARTERS NO ONE HAD EVER SUCCEEDED IN RENDERING HIM DRUNK HE SMOKED A BIG PIPE
1624-168623-0010 HE WORE A BLOUSE AND UNDER HIS BLOUSE AN OLD BLACK COAT HE MADE PRETENSIONS TO LITERATURE AND TO MATERIALISM THERE WERE CERTAIN NAMES WHICH HE OFTEN PRONOUNCED TO SUPPORT WHATEVER THINGS HE MIGHT BE SAYING VOLTAIRE
1624-168623-0011 HE DECLARED THAT HE HAD A SYSTEM IN ADDITION HE WAS A GREAT SWINDLER
1624-168623-0012 THE SPECIES DOES EXIST IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT HE PRETENDED TO HAVE SERVED IN THE ARMY HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF RELATING WITH EXUBERANCE HOW BEING A SERGEANT IN THE SIXTH OR THE NINTH LIGHT SOMETHING OR OTHER AT WATERLOO
1624-168623-0013 HE HAD ALONE AND IN THE PRESENCE OF A SQUADRON OF DEATH DEALING HUSSARS COVERED WITH HIS BODY AND SAVED FROM DEATH IN THE MIDST OF THE GRAPE SHOT A GENERAL WHO HAD BEEN DANGEROUSLY WOUNDED
1624-168623-0014 THENCE AROSE FOR HIS WALL THE FLARING SIGN AND FOR HIS INN THE NAME WHICH IT BORE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE CABARET OF THE SERGEANT OF WATERLOO HE WAS A LIBERAL A CLASSIC AND A BONAPARTIST
1624-168623-0015 WE BELIEVE THAT HE HAD SIMPLY STUDIED IN HOLLAND FOR AN INN KEEPER THIS RASCAL OF COMPOSITE ORDER WAS IN ALL PROBABILITY SOME FLEMING FROM LILLE IN FLANDERS A FRENCHMAN IN PARIS A BELGIAN AT BRUSSELS
1624-168623-0016 BEING COMFORTABLY ASTRIDE OF BOTH FRONTIERS AS FOR HIS PROWESS AT WATERLOO THE READER IS ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THAT IT WILL BE PERCEIVED THAT HE EXAGGERATED IT A TRIFLE EBB AND FLOW
1624-168623-0017 A TATTERED CONSCIENCE ENTAILS A FRAGMENTARY LIFE AND APPARENTLY AT THE STORMY EPOCH OF JUNE EIGHTEENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN THENARDIER BELONGED TO THAT VARIETY OF MARAUDING SUTLERS OF WHICH WE HAVE SPOKEN
1624-168623-0018 BEATING ABOUT THE COUNTRY SELLING TO SOME STEALING FROM OTHERS AND TRAVELLING LIKE A FAMILY MAN WITH WIFE AND CHILDREN IN A RICKETY CART IN THE REAR OF TROOPS ON THE MARCH WITH AN INSTINCT FOR ALWAYS ATTACHING HIMSELF TO THE VICTORIOUS ARMY
1624-168623-0019 THIS CAMPAIGN ENDED AND HAVING AS HE SAID
1624-168623-0020 OF GOLD RINGS AND SILVER CROSSES GATHERED IN HARVEST TIME IN FURROWS SOWN WITH CORPSES DID NOT AMOUNT TO A LARGE TOTAL AND DID NOT CARRY THIS SUTLER TURNED EATING HOUSE KEEPER VERY FAR
1624-168623-0021 ACCOMPANIED BY AN OATH RECALLS THE BARRACKS AND BY A SIGN OF THE CROSS THE SEMINARY HE WAS A FINE TALKER HE ALLOWED IT TO BE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS AN EDUCATED MAN
1624-168623-0022 BUT PRACTISED EYES SOMETIMES SPIED OUT ORTHOGRAPHICAL ERRORS IN IT THENARDIER WAS CUNNING GREEDY SLOTHFUL AND CLEVER HE DID NOT DISDAIN HIS SERVANTS WHICH CAUSED HIS WIFE TO DISPENSE WITH THEM
1624-168623-0023 THIS GIANTESS WAS JEALOUS IT SEEMED TO HER THAT THAT THIN AND YELLOW LITTLE MAN MUST BE AN OBJECT COVETED BY ALL THENARDIER WHO WAS ABOVE ALL AN ASTUTE AND WELL BALANCED MAN WAS A SCAMP OF A TEMPERATE SORT
1624-168623-0024 THIS IS THE WORST SPECIES HYPOCRISY ENTERS INTO IT IT IS NOT THAT THENARDIER WAS NOT ON OCCASION CAPABLE OF WRATH TO QUITE THE SAME DEGREE AS HIS WIFE BUT THIS WAS VERY RARE
1624-168623-0025 AND AT SUCH TIMES SINCE HE WAS ENRAGED WITH THE HUMAN RACE IN GENERAL AS HE BORE WITHIN HIM A DEEP FURNACE OF HATRED AND SINCE HE WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONTINUALLY AVENGING THEIR WRONGS
1624-168623-0026 WHO ACCUSE EVERYTHING THAT PASSES BEFORE THEM OF EVERYTHING WHICH HAS BEFALLEN THEM AND WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO CAST UPON THE FIRST PERSON WHO COMES TO HAND AS A LEGITIMATE GRIEVANCE THE SUM TOTAL OF THE DECEPTIONS THE BANKRUPTCIES AND THE CALAMITIES OF THEIR LIVES
1624-168623-0027 WHEN ALL THIS LEAVEN WAS STIRRED UP IN HIM AND BOILED FORTH FROM HIS MOUTH AND EYES HE WAS TERRIBLE WOE TO THE PERSON WHO CAME UNDER HIS WRATH AT SUCH A TIME IN ADDITION TO HIS OTHER QUALITIES THENARDIER WAS ATTENTIVE AND PENETRATING
1624-168623-0028 SILENT OR TALKATIVE ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES AND ALWAYS HIGHLY INTELLIGENT HE HAD SOMETHING OF THE LOOK OF SAILORS WHO ARE ACCUSTOMED TO SCREW UP THEIR EYES TO GAZE THROUGH MARINE GLASSES THENARDIER WAS A STATESMAN
1624-168623-0029 EVERY NEW COMER WHO ENTERED THE TAVERN SAID ON CATCHING SIGHT OF MADAME THENARDIER THERE IS THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE A MISTAKE SHE WAS NOT EVEN THE MISTRESS THE HUSBAND WAS BOTH MASTER AND MISTRESS
1624-168623-0030 SHE WORKED HE CREATED HE DIRECTED EVERYTHING BY A SORT OF INVISIBLE AND CONSTANT MAGNETIC ACTION A WORD WAS SUFFICIENT FOR HIM SOMETIMES A SIGN THE MASTODON OBEYED
1624-168623-0031 THOUGH SHE DID NOT THOROUGHLY REALIZE IT SHE WAS POSSESSED OF VIRTUES AFTER HER OWN KIND IF SHE HAD EVER HAD A DISAGREEMENT AS TO ANY DETAIL WITH
1624-168623-0032 WHICH WAS AN INADMISSIBLE HYPOTHESIS BY THE WAY SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BLAMED HER HUSBAND IN PUBLIC ON ANY SUBJECT WHATEVER SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE COMMITTED BEFORE STRANGERS THAT
1624-168623-0033 EXPOSING THE CROWN ALTHOUGH THEIR CONCORD HAD ONLY EVIL AS ITS RESULT
1624-168623-0034 VIEWED ON ITS DWARFED AND GROTESQUE SIDE THIS WAS THAT GRAND AND UNIVERSAL THING THE ADORATION OF MIND BY MATTER FOR CERTAIN UGLY FEATURES HAVE A CAUSE IN THE VERY DEPTHS OF ETERNAL BEAUTY
1624-168623-0035 HENCE THE ABSOLUTE EMPIRE OF THE MAN OVER THAT WOMAN AT CERTAIN MOMENTS SHE BEHELD HIM LIKE A LIGHTED CANDLE AT OTHERS SHE FELT HIM LIKE A CLAW THIS WOMAN WAS A FORMIDABLE CREATURE WHO LOVED NO ONE EXCEPT HER CHILDREN
1624-168623-0036 AND WHO DID NOT FEAR ANY ONE EXCEPT HER HUSBAND SHE WAS A MOTHER BECAUSE SHE WAS MAMMIFEROUS BUT HER MATERNITY STOPPED SHORT WITH HER DAUGHTERS AND AS WE SHALL SEE DID NOT EXTEND TO BOYS THE MAN HAD BUT ONE THOUGHT HOW TO ENRICH HIMSELF
1624-168623-0037 A THEATRE WORTHY OF THIS GREAT TALENT WAS LACKING
1624-168623-0038 IF RUIN IS POSSIBLE TO ZERO IN SWITZERLAND OR IN THE PYRENEES THIS PENNILESS SCAMP WOULD HAVE BECOME A MILLIONAIRE BUT AN INN KEEPER MUST BROWSE WHERE FATE HAS HITCHED HIM
1624-168623-0039 IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE WORD INN KEEPER IS HERE EMPLOYED IN A RESTRICTED SENSE AND DOES NOT EXTEND TO AN ENTIRE CLASS IN THIS SAME YEAR EIGHTEEN TWENTY THREE
1624-168623-0040 THENARDIER WAS BURDENED WITH ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED FRANCS WORTH OF PETTY DEBTS AND THIS RENDERED HIM ANXIOUS WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN THE OBSTINATE INJUSTICE OF DESTINY IN THIS CASE THENARDIER WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO UNDERSTAND BEST
1624-168623-0041 WITH THE MOST PROFUNDITY AND IN THE MOST MODERN FASHION THAT THING WHICH IS A VIRTUE AMONG BARBAROUS PEOPLES AND AN OBJECT OF MERCHANDISE AMONG CIVILIZED PEOPLES HOSPITALITY BESIDES HE WAS AN ADMIRABLE POACHER
1624-168623-0042 AND QUOTED FOR HIS SKILL IN SHOOTING HE HAD A CERTAIN COLD AND TRANQUIL LAUGH WHICH WAS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS HIS THEORIES AS A LANDLORD SOMETIMES BURST FORTH IN LIGHTNING FLASHES
1624-168623-0043 HE HAD PROFESSIONAL APHORISMS WHICH HE INSERTED INTO HIS WIFE'S MIND THE DUTY OF THE INN KEEPER
1624-168623-0044 AND A SMILE TO STOP PASSERS BY TO EMPTY SMALL PURSES AND TO HONESTLY LIGHTEN HEAVY ONES TO SHELTER TRAVELLING FAMILIES RESPECTFULLY
1624-168623-0045 TO SHAVE THE MAN TO PLUCK THE WOMAN TO PICK THE CHILD CLEAN TO QUOTE THE WINDOW OPEN THE WINDOW SHUT THE CHIMNEY CORNER THE ARM CHAIR THE CHAIR THE OTTOMAN THE STOOL THE FEATHER BED THE MATTRESS AND THE TRUSS OF STRAW
1624-168623-0046 TO KNOW HOW MUCH THE SHADOW USES UP THE MIRROR AND TO PUT A PRICE ON IT AND BY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DEVILS TO MAKE THE TRAVELLER PAY FOR EVERYTHING
1624-168623-0047 THIS MAN AND THIS WOMAN WERE RUSE AND RAGE WEDDED A HIDEOUS AND TERRIBLE TEAM WHILE THE HUSBAND PONDERED AND COMBINED MADAME THENARDIER THOUGHT NOT OF ABSENT CREDITORS
1624-168623-0048 TOOK NO HEED OF YESTERDAY NOR OF TO MORROW AND LIVED IN A FIT OF ANGER ALL IN A MINUTE SUCH WERE THESE TWO BEINGS COSETTE WAS BETWEEN THEM SUBJECTED TO THEIR DOUBLE PRESSURE
1624-168623-0049 THE MAN AND THE WOMAN EACH HAD A DIFFERENT METHOD COSETTE WAS OVERWHELMED WITH BLOWS THIS WAS THE WOMAN'S SHE WENT BAREFOOTED IN WINTER THAT WAS THE MAN'S DOING
1624-168623-0050 COSETTE RAN UP STAIRS AND DOWN WASHED SWEPT RUBBED DUSTED RAN FLUTTERED ABOUT PANTED MOVED HEAVY ARTICLES AND WEAK AS SHE WAS DID THE COARSE WORK THERE WAS NO MERCY FOR HER
1624-168623-0051 A FIERCE MISTRESS AND VENOMOUS MASTER THE THENARDIER HOSTELRY WAS LIKE A SPIDER'S WEB IN WHICH COSETTE HAD BEEN CAUGHT AND WHERE SHE LAY TREMBLING THE IDEAL OF OPPRESSION WAS REALIZED BY THIS SINISTER HOUSEHOLD
1624-168623-0052 IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THE FLY SERVING THE SPIDERS THE POOR CHILD PASSIVELY HELD HER PEACE WHAT TAKES PLACE WITHIN THESE SOULS WHEN THEY HAVE BUT JUST QUITTED GOD FIND THEMSELVES THUS
1624-168623-0053 AT THE VERY DAWN OF LIFE VERY SMALL
163-121908-0000 SHE CEASED AND WAS ABOUT TO PASS ON IN HER DISCOURSE TO THE EXPOSITION OF OTHER MATTERS WHEN I BREAK IN AND SAY EXCELLENT IS THINE EXHORTATION AND SUCH AS WELL BESEEMETH THY HIGH AUTHORITY
163-121908-0001 AT ALL AND IF SO WHAT IT IS THEN SHE MADE ANSWER I AM ANXIOUS TO FULFIL MY PROMISE COMPLETELY AND OPEN TO THEE A WAY OF RETURN TO THY NATIVE LAND
163-121908-0002 WHAT PLACE CAN BE LEFT FOR RANDOM ACTION WHEN GOD CONSTRAINETH ALL THINGS TO ORDER FOR EX NIHILO NIHIL IS SOUND DOCTRINE WHICH NONE OF THE ANCIENTS GAINSAID
163-121908-0003 ALTHOUGH THEY USED IT OF MATERIAL SUBSTANCE NOT OF THE EFFICIENT PRINCIPLE THIS THEY LAID DOWN AS A KIND OF BASIS FOR ALL THEIR REASONINGS CONCERNING NATURE NOW
163-121908-0004 OUR GOOD ARISTOTLE SAYS SHE HAS DEFINED IT CONCISELY IN HIS PHYSICS AND CLOSELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TRUTH HOW PRAY SAID I
163-121908-0005 FOR INSTANCE IF A MAN IS DIGGING THE EARTH FOR TILLAGE AND FINDS A MASS OF BURIED GOLD NOW SUCH A FIND IS REGARDED AS ACCIDENTAL YET IT IS NOT
163-121908-0006 EX NIHILO FOR IT HAS ITS PROPER CAUSES THE UNFORESEEN AND UNEXPECTED CONCURRENCE OF WHICH HAS BROUGHT THE CHANCE ABOUT FOR HAD NOT THE CULTIVATOR BEEN DIGGING
163-121908-0007 HAD NOT THE MAN WHO HID THE MONEY BURIED IT IN THAT PRECISE SPOT THE GOLD WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOUND THESE THEN ARE THE REASONS WHY THE FIND IS A CHANCE ONE IN THAT IT RESULTS FROM CAUSES WHICH MET TOGETHER AND CONCURRED
163-121908-0008 NOT FROM ANY INTENTION ON THE PART OF THE DISCOVERER SINCE NEITHER HE WHO BURIED THE GOLD NOR HE WHO WORKED IN THE FIELD INTENDED THAT THE MONEY SHOULD BE FOUND BUT AS I SAID IT HAPPENED
163-121908-0009 BY COINCIDENCE THAT ONE DUG WHERE THE OTHER BURIED THE TREASURE WE MAY THEN DEFINE CHANCE AS BEING AN UNEXPECTED RESULT FLOWING FROM A CONCURRENCE OF CAUSES WHERE THE SEVERAL FACTORS HAD SOME DEFINITE END
163-121908-0010 BUT THE MEETING AND CONCURRENCE OF THESE CAUSES ARISES FROM THAT INEVITABLE CHAIN OF ORDER WHICH FLOWING FROM THE FOUNTAIN HEAD OF PROVIDENCE DISPOSES ALL THINGS IN THEIR DUE TIME AND PLACE
163-121908-0011 SOON TO DRAW APART AND PLAINWARD EACH ITS SEPARATE WAY TO WEND WHEN ONCE MORE THEIR WATERS MINGLE IN A CHANNEL
163-121908-0012 DEEP AND WIDE ALL THE FLOTSAM COMES TOGETHER THAT IS BORNE UPON THE TIDE SHIPS AND TRUNKS OF TREES UPROOTED IN THE TORRENT'S WILD CAREER MEET AS MID THE SWIRLING WATERS
163-122947-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN OUR VIRTUES
163-122947-0001 OUR VIRTUES IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE TOO HAVE STILL OUR VIRTUES ALTHOUGH NATURALLY THEY ARE NOT THOSE SINCERE AND MASSIVE VIRTUES ON ACCOUNT OF WHICH WE HOLD OUR GRANDFATHERS IN ESTEEM
163-122947-0002 AND ALSO AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM US WE EUROPEANS OF THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW WE FIRSTLINGS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WITH ALL OUR DANGEROUS CURIOSITY OUR MULTIFARIOUSNESS AND ART OF DISGUISING
163-122947-0003 WITH OUR MOST ARDENT REQUIREMENTS WELL THEN LET US LOOK FOR THEM IN OUR LABYRINTHS WHERE AS WE KNOW SO MANY THINGS LOSE THEMSELVES SO MANY THINGS GET QUITE LOST
163-122947-0004 AND IS THERE ANYTHING FINER THAN TO SEARCH FOR ONE'S OWN VIRTUES IS IT NOT ALMOST TO BELIEVE IN ONE'S OWN VIRTUES BUT THIS BELIEVING IN ONE'S OWN VIRTUES
163-122947-0005 IT WILL BE DIFFERENT TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN AS IN THE STELLAR FIRMAMENT THERE ARE SOMETIMES TWO SUNS WHICH DETERMINE THE PATH OF ONE PLANET
163-122947-0006 NOW WITH RED LIGHT NOW WITH GREEN
163-122947-0007 SO WE MODERN MEN OWING TO THE COMPLICATED MECHANISM OF OUR FIRMAMENT ARE DETERMINED BY DIFFERENT MORALITIES
163-122947-0008 AND ARE SELDOM UNEQUIVOCAL AND THERE ARE OFTEN CASES ALSO IN WHICH OUR ACTIONS ARE MOTLEY COLOURED
163-122947-0009 INDEED AT TIMES THE HIGHER AND SUBLIMER THING TAKES PLACE WE LEARN TO DESPISE WHEN WE LOVE AND PRECISELY WHEN WE LOVE BEST ALL OF IT HOWEVER UNCONSCIOUSLY WITHOUT NOISE
163-122947-0010 IS OPPOSED TO OUR TASTE NOWADAYS THIS IS ALSO AN ADVANCE AS IT WAS AN ADVANCE IN OUR FATHERS THAT RELIGION AS AN ATTITUDE FINALLY BECAME OPPOSED TO THEIR TASTE INCLUDING THE ENMITY
163-122947-0011 AND VOLTAIREAN BITTERNESS AGAINST RELIGION AND ALL THAT FORMERLY BELONGED TO FREETHINKER PANTOMIME IT IS THE MUSIC IN OUR CONSCIENCE THE DANCE IN OUR SPIRIT TO WHICH PURITAN LITANIES
163-122947-0012 MORAL SERMONS AND GOODY GOODNESS WON'T CHIME
163-122947-0013 LET US BE CAREFUL IN DEALING WITH THOSE WHO ATTACH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO BEING CREDITED WITH MORAL TACT AND SUBTLETY IN MORAL DISCERNMENT THEY NEVER FORGIVE US IF THEY HAVE ONCE MADE A MISTAKE BEFORE US
163-122947-0014 FOR THEY GET THE BETTER EVEN OF THEIR BLUNDERS
163-122947-0015 JUST AS THOUGH IN SHORT THEY BETRAY SOMETHING THEREBY FLAUBERT FOR INSTANCE
163-122947-0016 I WOULD NOW RECOMMEND FOR A CHANGE SOMETHING ELSE FOR A PLEASURE NAMELY THE UNCONSCIOUS ASTUTENESS WITH WHICH GOOD FAT HONEST MEDIOCRITY ALWAYS BEHAVES TOWARDS LOFTIER SPIRITS
163-122947-0017 SUBTLER EVEN THAN THE UNDERSTANDING OF ITS VICTIMS A REPEATED PROOF THAT INSTINCT IS THE MOST INTELLIGENT OF ALL KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE WHICH HAVE HITHERTO BEEN DISCOVERED
163-122947-0018 TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN THE PRACTICE OF JUDGING AND CONDEMNING MORALLY IS THE FAVOURITE REVENGE OF THE INTELLECTUALLY SHALLOW ON THOSE WHO ARE LESS SO
163-122947-0019 IT IS ALSO A KIND OF INDEMNITY FOR THEIR BEING BADLY ENDOWED BY NATURE AND FINALLY IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ACQUIRING SPIRIT AND BECOMING SUBTLE
163-122947-0020 MALICE SPIRITUALISES THEY ARE GLAD IN THEIR INMOST HEART THAT THERE IS A STANDARD ACCORDING TO WHICH THOSE WHO ARE OVER ENDOWED WITH INTELLECTUAL GOODS AND PRIVILEGES ARE EQUAL TO THEM
163-122947-0021 I SHALL TAKE CARE NOT TO SAY SO I WOULD RATHER FLATTER THEM WITH MY THEORY THAT LOFTY SPIRITUALITY ITSELF EXISTS ONLY AS THE ULTIMATE PRODUCT OF MORAL QUALITIES
163-122947-0022 IS PRECISELY THE SPIRITUALISING OF JUSTICE
163-122947-0023 GRADATIONS OF RANK IN THE WORLD EVEN AMONG THINGS AND NOT ONLY AMONG MEN
163-122947-0024 AND WHAT ARE THE THINGS GENERALLY WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY AND PROFOUNDLY CONCERN ORDINARY MEN INCLUDING THE CULTURED EVEN THE LEARNED AND PERHAPS PHILOSOPHERS ALSO IF APPEARANCES DO NOT DECEIVE
163-122947-0025 THE FACT THEREBY BECOMES OBVIOUS THAT THE GREATER PART OF WHAT INTERESTS AND CHARMS HIGHER NATURES AND MORE REFINED AND FASTIDIOUS TASTES SEEMS ABSOLUTELY UNINTERESTING TO THE AVERAGE MAN IF
163-122947-0026 NOTWITHSTANDING HE PERCEIVE DEVOTION TO THESE INTERESTS HE CALLS IT DESINTERESSE AND WONDERS HOW IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACT DISINTERESTEDLY THERE HAVE BEEN PHILOSOPHERS
163-122947-0027 WHO COULD GIVE THIS POPULAR ASTONISHMENT A SEDUCTIVE AND MYSTICAL OTHER WORLDLY EXPRESSION PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT KNOW THE HIGHER NATURE BY EXPERIENCE INSTEAD OF STATING
163-122947-0028 EVEN AN ACTION FOR LOVE'S SAKE SHALL BE UNEGOISTIC BUT YOU FOOLS AND THE PRAISE OF THE SELF SACRIFICER BUT WHOEVER HAS REALLY OFFERED SACRIFICE KNOWS
163-122947-0029 THAT HE WANTED AND OBTAINED SOMETHING FOR IT PERHAPS SOMETHING FROM HIMSELF FOR SOMETHING FROM HIMSELF THAT HE RELINQUISHED HERE IN ORDER TO HAVE MORE THERE PERHAPS IN GENERAL TO BE MORE
163-122947-0030 THAT I HONOUR AND RESPECT AN UNSELFISH MAN NOT HOWEVER BECAUSE HE IS UNSELFISH BUT BECAUSE I THINK HE HAS A RIGHT TO BE USEFUL TO ANOTHER MAN AT HIS OWN EXPENSE IN SHORT THE QUESTION IS ALWAYS
163-122947-0031 AND WHO THE OTHER IS FOR INSTANCE IN A PERSON CREATED AND DESTINED FOR COMMAND SELF DENIAL AND MODEST RETIREMENT INSTEAD OF BEING VIRTUES WOULD BE THE WASTE OF VIRTUES
163-122947-0032 SO IT SEEMS TO ME EVERY SYSTEM OF UNEGOISTIC MORALITY WHICH TAKES ITSELF UNCONDITIONALLY AND APPEALS TO EVERY ONE NOT ONLY SINS AGAINST GOOD TASTE
163-122947-0033 BUT IS ALSO AN INCENTIVE TO SINS OF OMISSION AN ADDITIONAL SEDUCTION UNDER THE MASK OF PHILANTHROPY AND PRECISELY A SEDUCTION AND INJURY TO THE HIGHER RARER AND MORE PRIVILEGED TYPES OF MEN
163-122947-0034 MORAL SYSTEMS MUST BE COMPELLED FIRST OF ALL TO BOW BEFORE THE GRADATIONS OF RANK THEIR PRESUMPTION MUST BE DRIVEN HOME TO THEIR CONSCIENCE UNTIL THEY THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND AT LAST
163-122947-0035 THAT IT IS IMMORAL TO SAY THAT WHAT IS RIGHT FOR ONE IS PROPER FOR ANOTHER SO SAID MY MORALISTIC PEDANT AND BONHOMME
163-122947-0036 DID HE PERHAPS DESERVE TO BE LAUGHED AT WHEN HE THUS EXHORTED SYSTEMS OF MORALS TO PRACTISE MORALITY BUT ONE SHOULD NOT BE TOO MUCH IN THE RIGHT
163-122947-0037 FELLOW SUFFERING IS PREACHED NOWADAYS AND IF I GATHER RIGHTLY NO OTHER RELIGION IS ANY LONGER PREACHED LET THE PSYCHOLOGIST HAVE HIS EARS OPEN THROUGH ALL THE VANITY THROUGH ALL THE NOISE WHICH IS NATURAL TO THESE PREACHERS
163-122947-0038 AS TO ALL PREACHERS HE WILL HEAR A HOARSE GROANING GENUINE NOTE OF SELF CONTEMPT IT BELONGS TO THE OVERSHADOWING AND UGLIFYING OF EUROPE WHICH HAS BEEN ON THE INCREASE FOR A CENTURY
163-122947-0039 THE FIRST SYMPTOMS OF WHICH ARE ALREADY SPECIFIED DOCUMENTARILY IN A THOUGHTFUL LETTER OF GALIANI TO MADAME D'EPINAY IF IT IS NOT REALLY THE CAUSE THEREOF THE MAN OF MODERN IDEAS
163-122947-0040 THE HYBRID EUROPEAN A TOLERABLY UGLY PLEBEIAN TAKEN ALL IN ALL ABSOLUTELY REQUIRES A COSTUME HE NEEDS HISTORY AS A STOREROOM OF COSTUMES
163-122947-0041 TO BE SURE HE NOTICES THAT NONE OF THE COSTUMES FIT HIM PROPERLY HE CHANGES AND CHANGES LET US LOOK AT THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WITH RESPECT TO THESE HASTY PREFERENCES AND CHANGES IN ITS MASQUERADES OF STYLE
163-122947-0042 AND ALSO WITH RESPECT TO ITS MOMENTS OF DESPERATION ON ACCOUNT OF NOTHING SUITING US IT IS IN VAIN TO GET OURSELVES UP AS ROMANTIC OR CLASSICAL OR CHRISTIAN
163-122947-0043 OR FLORENTINE OR BAROCCO OR NATIONAL IN MORIBUS ET ARTIBUS IT DOES NOT CLOTHE US BUT THE SPIRIT ESPECIALLY THE
163-122947-0044 HISTORICAL SPIRIT PROFITS EVEN BY THIS DESPERATION ONCE AND AGAIN A NEW SAMPLE OF THE PAST OR OF THE FOREIGN IS TESTED PUT ON TAKEN OFF PACKED UP AND ABOVE ALL STUDIED
163-122947-0045 WE ARE PREPARED AS NO OTHER AGE HAS EVER BEEN FOR A CARNIVAL IN THE GRAND STYLE FOR THE MOST SPIRITUAL FESTIVAL LAUGHTER AND ARROGANCE FOR THE TRANSCENDENTAL HEIGHT OF SUPREME FOLLY
163-122947-0046 AND ARISTOPHANIC RIDICULE OF THE WORLD PERHAPS WE ARE STILL DISCOVERING THE DOMAIN OF OUR INVENTION JUST HERE THE DOMAIN WHERE EVEN WE CAN STILL BE ORIGINAL
163-122947-0047 PROBABLY AS PARODISTS OF THE WORLD'S HISTORY AND AS GOD'S MERRY ANDREWS PERHAPS THOUGH NOTHING ELSE OF THE PRESENT HAVE A FUTURE OUR LAUGHTER ITSELF MAY HAVE A FUTURE
163-122947-0048 THE HISTORICAL SENSE OR THE CAPACITY FOR DIVINING QUICKLY THE ORDER OF RANK OF THE VALUATIONS ACCORDING TO WHICH A PEOPLE A COMMUNITY OR AN INDIVIDUAL HAS LIVED
163-122947-0049 THE DIVINING INSTINCT FOR THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THESE VALUATIONS FOR THE RELATION OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE VALUATIONS TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE OPERATING FORCES THIS HISTORICAL SENSE
163-122947-0050 HAS COME TO US IN THE TRAIN OF THE ENCHANTING AND MAD SEMI BARBARITY INTO WHICH EUROPE HAS BEEN PLUNGED BY THE DEMOCRATIC MINGLING OF CLASSES AND RACES IT IS ONLY THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THAT HAS RECOGNIZED THIS FACULTY
163-122947-0051 AS ITS SIXTH SENSE OWING TO THIS MINGLING THE PAST OF EVERY FORM AND MODE OF LIFE AND OF CULTURES WHICH WERE FORMERLY CLOSELY CONTIGUOUS AND SUPERIMPOSED ON ONE ANOTHER FLOWS FORTH INTO US
163-122947-0052 BY MEANS OF OUR SEMI BARBARITY IN BODY AND IN DESIRE WE HAVE SECRET ACCESS EVERYWHERE SUCH AS A NOBLE AGE NEVER HAD WE HAVE ACCESS ABOVE ALL TO THE LABYRINTH OF IMPERFECT CIVILIZATIONS
163-122947-0053 AND TO EVERY FORM OF SEMI BARBARITY THAT HAS AT ANY TIME EXISTED ON EARTH AND IN SO FAR AS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE PART OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION HITHERTO HAS JUST BEEN SEMI BARBARITY
163-122947-0054 THE HISTORICAL SENSE IMPLIES ALMOST THE SENSE AND INSTINCT FOR EVERYTHING THE TASTE AND TONGUE FOR EVERYTHING WHEREBY IT IMMEDIATELY PROVES ITSELF TO BE AN IGNOBLE SENSE FOR INSTANCE
163-122947-0055 WE ENJOY HOMER ONCE MORE IT IS PERHAPS OUR HAPPIEST ACQUISITION THAT WE KNOW HOW TO APPRECIATE HOMER WHOM MEN OF DISTINGUISHED CULTURE
163-122947-0056 ESPRIT VASTE AND EVEN VOLTAIRE THE LAST ECHO OF THE CENTURY CANNOT AND COULD NOT SO EASILY APPROPRIATE WHOM THEY SCARCELY PERMITTED THEMSELVES TO ENJOY THE VERY DECIDED YEA
163-122947-0057 A DISSATISFACTION WITH ITS OWN CONDITION OR AN ADMIRATION OF WHAT IS STRANGE ALL THIS DETERMINES AND DISPOSES THEM UNFAVOURABLY EVEN TOWARDS THE BEST THINGS OF THE WORLD WHICH ARE NOT THEIR PROPERTY
163-122947-0058 OR COULD NOT BECOME THEIR PREY AND NO FACULTY IS MORE UNINTELLIGIBLE TO SUCH MEN THAN JUST THIS HISTORICAL SENSE WITH ITS TRUCKLING PLEBEIAN CURIOSITY
163-122947-0059 THE CASE IS NOT DIFFERENT WITH SHAKESPEARE THAT MARVELOUS SPANISH MOORISH SAXON SYNTHESIS OF TASTE OVER WHOM AN ANCIENT ATHENIAN
163-122947-0060 WITH A SECRET CONFIDENCE AND CORDIALITY WE ENJOY IT AS A REFINEMENT OF ART RESERVED EXPRESSLY FOR US AND ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE AS LITTLE DISTURBED BY THE REPULSIVE FUMES AND THE PROXIMITY OF THE ENGLISH POPULACE
163-122947-0061 IN WHICH SHAKESPEARE'S ART AND TASTE LIVES AS PERHAPS ON THE CHIAJA OF NAPLES WHERE WITH ALL OUR SENSES AWAKE WE GO OUR WAY ENCHANTED AND VOLUNTARILY
163-122947-0062 LET US FINALLY CONFESS IT THAT WHAT IS MOST DIFFICULT FOR US MEN OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE TO GRASP FEEL TASTE AND LOVE WHAT FINDS US FUNDAMENTALLY PREJUDICED AND ALMOST HOSTILE
163-122947-0063 IS PRECISELY THE PERFECTION AND ULTIMATE MATURITY IN EVERY CULTURE AND ART THE ESSENTIALLY NOBLE IN WORKS AND MEN THEIR MOMENT OF SMOOTH SEA AND HALCYON SELF SUFFICIENCY
163-122947-0064 THE GOLDENNESS AND COLDNESS WHICH ALL THINGS SHOW THAT HAVE PERFECTED THEMSELVES PERHAPS OUR GREAT VIRTUE OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE IS IN NECESSARY CONTRAST TO GOOD TASTE
163-122947-0065 AT LEAST TO THE VERY BAD TASTE AND WE CAN ONLY EVOKE IN OURSELVES IMPERFECTLY HESITATINGLY AND WITH COMPULSION THE SMALL SHORT AND HAPPY GODSENDS AND GLORIFICATIONS OF HUMAN LIFE
163-122947-0066 AS THEY SHINE HERE AND THERE THOSE MOMENTS AND MARVELOUS EXPERIENCES WHEN A GREAT POWER HAS VOLUNTARILY COME TO A HALT BEFORE THE BOUNDLESS AND INFINITE WHEN A SUPER ABUNDANCE OF REFINED DELIGHT HAS BEEN ENJOYED
163-122947-0067 OUR ITCHING IS REALLY THE ITCHING FOR THE INFINITE THE IMMEASURABLE LIKE THE RIDER ON HIS FORWARD PANTING HORSE WE LET THE REINS FALL BEFORE THE INFINITE WE MODERN MEN WE SEMI BARBARIANS
163-122947-0068 WHETHER IT BE HEDONISM PESSIMISM UTILITARIANISM OR EUDAEMONISM ALL THOSE MODES OF THINKING WHICH MEASURE THE WORTH OF THINGS ACCORDING TO PLEASURE AND PAIN
163-122947-0069 THAT IS ACCORDING TO ACCOMPANYING CIRCUMSTANCES AND SECONDARY CONSIDERATIONS ARE PLAUSIBLE MODES OF THOUGHT AND NAIVETES WHICH EVERY ONE CONSCIOUS OF CREATIVE POWERS AND AN ARTIST'S CONSCIENCE
163-122947-0070 FOR SOCIETY WITH ITS SICK AND MISFORTUNED FOR THE HEREDITARILY VICIOUS AND DEFECTIVE WHO LIE ON THE GROUND AROUND US STILL LESS IS IT SYMPATHY FOR THE GRUMBLING
163-122947-0071 WHO STRIVE AFTER POWER THEY CALL IT FREEDOM OUR SYMPATHY IS A LOFTIER AND FURTHER SIGHTED SYMPATHY WE SEE HOW MAN DWARFS HIMSELF HOW YOU DWARF HIM
163-122947-0072 AND MAKES HIS DESTRUCTION DESIRABLE THE DISCIPLINE OF SUFFERING OF GREAT SUFFERING KNOW YE NOT THAT IT IS ONLY THIS DISCIPLINE THAT HAS PRODUCED ALL THE ELEVATIONS OF HUMANITY HITHERTO
163-122947-0073 THE TENSION OF SOUL IN MISFORTUNE WHICH COMMUNICATES TO IT ITS ENERGY ITS SHUDDERING IN VIEW OF RACK AND RUIN ITS INVENTIVENESS AND BRAVERY IN UNDERGOING ENDURING
163-122947-0074 CREATURE AND CREATOR ARE UNITED IN MAN THERE IS NOT ONLY MATTER SHRED EXCESS CLAY MIRE FOLLY CHAOS BUT THERE IS ALSO THE CREATOR
163-122947-0075 THE SCULPTOR THE HARDNESS OF THE HAMMER THE DIVINITY OF THE SPECTATOR AND THE SEVENTH DAY DO YE UNDERSTAND THIS CONTRAST AND THAT YOUR SYMPATHY FOR THE CREATURE IN MAN
163-122947-0076 APPLIES TO THAT WHICH HAS TO BE FASHIONED BRUISED FORGED STRETCHED ROASTED ANNEALED REFINED
163-122947-0077 SO IT IS SYMPATHY AGAINST SYMPATHY BUT TO REPEAT IT ONCE MORE THERE ARE HIGHER PROBLEMS THAN THE PROBLEMS OF PLEASURE AND PAIN AND SYMPATHY
163-122947-0078 AND ALL SYSTEMS OF PHILOSOPHY WHICH DEAL ONLY WITH THESE ARE NAIVETES TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SIX
163-122947-0079 IN WHICH WE HAVE TO FEAR AND LOVE THIS ALMOST INVISIBLE INAUDIBLE WORLD OF DELICATE COMMAND AND DELICATE OBEDIENCE A WORLD OF ALMOST IN EVERY RESPECT CAPTIOUS INSIDIOUS SHARP
163-122947-0080 AND TENDER YES IT IS WELL PROTECTED FROM CLUMSY SPECTATORS AND FAMILIAR CURIOSITY WE ARE WOVEN INTO A STRONG NET AND GARMENT OF DUTIES AND CANNOT DISENGAGE OURSELVES
163-122947-0081 PRECISELY HERE WE ARE MEN OF DUTY EVEN WE OCCASIONALLY IT IS TRUE WE DANCE IN OUR CHAINS AND BETWIXT OUR SWORDS
163-122947-0082 THESE ARE MEN WITHOUT DUTY WE HAVE ALWAYS FOOLS AND APPEARANCES AGAINST US
163-122947-0083 HONESTY GRANTING THAT IT IS THE VIRTUE OF WHICH WE CANNOT RID OURSELVES WE FREE SPIRITS WELL WE WILL LABOUR AT IT WITH ALL OUR PERVERSITY AND LOVE
163-122947-0084 AND NOT TIRE OF PERFECTING OURSELVES IN OUR VIRTUE WHICH ALONE REMAINS MAY ITS GLANCE SOME DAY OVERSPREAD LIKE A GILDED BLUE MOCKING TWILIGHT
163-122947-0085 LET US GO WITH ALL OUR DEVILS TO THE HELP OF OUR GOD IT IS PROBABLE THAT PEOPLE WILL MISUNDERSTAND AND MISTAKE US ON THAT ACCOUNT WHAT DOES IT MATTER
163-122947-0086 THEY WILL SAY THEIR HONESTY' THAT IS THEIR DEVILRY AND NOTHING ELSE WHAT DOES IT MATTER AND EVEN IF THEY WERE RIGHT HAVE NOT ALL GODS HITHERTO BEEN SUCH SANCTIFIED
163-122947-0087 OUR STUPIDITY EVERY VIRTUE INCLINES TO STUPIDITY EVERY STUPIDITY TO VIRTUE STUPID TO THE POINT OF SANCTITY THEY SAY IN RUSSIA LET US BE CAREFUL LEST
163-122947-0088 HAS BEEN MORE INJURED BY THE TEDIOUSNESS OF ITS ADVOCATES THAN BY ANYTHING ELSE AT THE SAME TIME HOWEVER I WOULD NOT WISH TO OVERLOOK THEIR GENERAL USEFULNESS
163-122947-0089 IT IS DESIRABLE THAT AS FEW PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE SHOULD REFLECT UPON MORALS AND CONSEQUENTLY IT IS VERY DESIRABLE THAT MORALS SHOULD NOT SOME DAY BECOME INTERESTING
163-122947-0090 BUT LET US NOT BE AFRAID THINGS STILL REMAIN TODAY AS THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN I SEE NO ONE IN EUROPE WHO HAS OR DISCLOSES AN IDEA OF THE FACT THAT PHILOSOPHIZING CONCERNING MORALS
163-122947-0091 INEVITABLE ENGLISH UTILITARIANS HOW PONDEROUSLY AND RESPECTABLY THEY STALK ON STALK ALONG A HOMERIC METAPHOR EXPRESSES IT BETTER IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF BENTHAM
163-122947-0092 JUST AS HE HAD ALREADY STALKED IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE RESPECTABLE HELVETIUS NO HE WAS NOT A DANGEROUS MAN HELVETIUS C E SENATEUR POCOCURANTE TO USE AN EXPRESSION OF GALIANI
163-122947-0093 NO NEW THOUGHT NOTHING OF THE NATURE OF A FINER TURNING OR BETTER EXPRESSION OF AN OLD THOUGHT NOT EVEN A PROPER HISTORY OF WHAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT AN IMPOSSIBLE LITERATURE
163-122947-0094 HAS INSINUATED ITSELF ALSO INTO THESE MORALISTS WHOM ONE MUST CERTAINLY READ WITH AN EYE TO THEIR MOTIVES IF ONE MUST READ THEM CONCEALED THIS TIME UNDER THE NEW FORM OF THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT
163-122947-0095 IS NOT A MORALIST THE OPPOSITE OF A PURITAN THAT IS TO SAY AS A THINKER WHO REGARDS MORALITY AS QUESTIONABLE AS WORTHY OF INTERROGATION IN SHORT AS A PROBLEM
163-122947-0096 IS MORALIZING NOT IMMORAL IN THE END THEY ALL WANT ENGLISH MORALITY TO BE RECOGNIZED AS AUTHORITATIVE INASMUCH AS MANKIND OR THE GENERAL UTILITY
163-122947-0097 OR THE HAPPINESS OF THE GREATEST NUMBER NO THE HAPPINESS OF ENGLAND WILL BE BEST SERVED THEREBY THEY WOULD LIKE BY ALL MEANS TO CONVINCE THEMSELVES THAT THE STRIVING AFTER ENGLISH HAPPINESS
163-122947-0098 I MEAN AFTER COMFORT AND FASHION
1723-141149-0000 PONSONBY SOUND BUILD WIGWAMS AND SETTLE THE FUEGIANS BIFURCATION OF THE BEAGLE CHANNEL GLACIERS RETURN TO THE SHIP SECOND VISIT IN THE SHIP TO THE SETTLEMENT EQUALITY OF CONDITION AMONGST THE NATIVES
1723-141149-0001 HAVING NOW FINISHED WITH PATAGONIA AND THE FALKLAND ISLANDS I WILL DESCRIBE OUR FIRST ARRIVAL IN TIERRA DEL FUEGO A LITTLE AFTER NOON WE DOUBLED CAPE SAINT DIEGO AND ENTERED THE FAMOUS STRAIT OF LE MAIRE
1723-141149-0002 WE KEPT CLOSE TO THE FUEGIAN SHORE BUT THE OUTLINE OF THE RUGGED INHOSPITABLE STATENLAND WAS VISIBLE AMIDST THE CLOUDS IN THE AFTERNOON WE ANCHORED IN THE BAY OF GOOD SUCCESS WHILE ENTERING WE WERE SALUTED IN A MANNER BECOMING THE INHABITANTS OF THIS SAVAGE LAND
1723-141149-0003 A GROUP OF FUEGIANS PARTLY CONCEALED BY THE ENTANGLED FOREST WERE PERCHED ON A WILD POINT OVERHANGING THE SEA AND AS WE PASSED BY THEY SPRANG UP AND WAVING THEIR TATTERED CLOAKS SENT FORTH A LOUD AND SONOROUS SHOUT THE SAVAGES FOLLOWED THE SHIP
1723-141149-0004 AND JUST BEFORE DARK WE SAW THEIR FIRE AND AGAIN HEARD THEIR WILD CRY THE HARBOUR CONSISTS OF A FINE PIECE OF WATER HALF SURROUNDED BY LOW ROUNDED MOUNTAINS OF CLAY SLATE WHICH ARE COVERED TO THE WATER'S EDGE BY ONE DENSE GLOOMY FOREST
1723-141149-0005 A SINGLE GLANCE AT THE LANDSCAPE WAS SUFFICIENT TO SHOW ME HOW WIDELY DIFFERENT IT WAS FROM ANYTHING I HAD EVER BEHELD AT NIGHT IT BLEW A GALE OF WIND AND HEAVY SQUALLS FROM THE MOUNTAINS SWEPT PAST US
1723-141149-0006 AND WE AS WELL AS OTHERS MAY CALL THIS GOOD SUCCESS BAY IN THE MORNING THE CAPTAIN SENT A PARTY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE FUEGIANS WHEN WE CAME WITHIN HAIL
1723-141149-0007 AND BEGAN TO SHOUT MOST VEHEMENTLY WISHING TO DIRECT US WHERE TO LAND WHEN WE WERE ON SHORE THE PARTY LOOKED RATHER ALARMED BUT CONTINUED TALKING AND MAKING GESTURES WITH GREAT RAPIDITY IT WAS WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE MOST CURIOUS AND INTERESTING SPECTACLE I EVER BEHELD
1723-141149-0008 I COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED HOW WIDE WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SAVAGE AND CIVILIZED MAN IT IS GREATER THAN BETWEEN A WILD AND DOMESTICATED ANIMAL
1723-141149-0009 THE CHIEF SPOKESMAN WAS OLD AND APPEARED TO BE THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY THE THREE OTHERS WERE POWERFUL YOUNG MEN ABOUT SIX FEET HIGH THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN HAD BEEN SENT AWAY THESE FUEGIANS ARE A VERY DIFFERENT RACE FROM THE STUNTED MISERABLE WRETCHES FARTHER WESTWARD
1723-141149-0010 AND THEY SEEM CLOSELY ALLIED TO THE FAMOUS PATAGONIANS OF THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN THEIR ONLY GARMENT CONSISTS OF A MANTLE MADE OF GUANACO SKIN WITH THE WOOL OUTSIDE THIS THEY WEAR JUST THROWN OVER THEIR SHOULDERS LEAVING THEIR PERSONS AS OFTEN EXPOSED AS COVERED
1723-141149-0011 HIS FACE WAS CROSSED BY TWO BROAD TRANSVERSE BARS ONE PAINTED BRIGHT RED REACHED FROM EAR TO EAR AND INCLUDED THE UPPER LIP THE OTHER WHITE LIKE CHALK EXTENDED ABOVE AND PARALLEL TO THE FIRST SO THAT EVEN HIS EYELIDS WERE THUS COLOURED
1723-141149-0012 THE OTHER TWO MEN WERE ORNAMENTED BY STREAKS OF BLACK POWDER MADE OF CHARCOAL THE PARTY ALTOGETHER CLOSELY RESEMBLED THE DEVILS WHICH COME ON THE STAGE IN PLAYS LIKE DER FREISCHUTZ THEIR VERY ATTITUDES WERE ABJECT
1723-141149-0013 AND THE EXPRESSION OF THEIR COUNTENANCES DISTRUSTFUL SURPRISED AND STARTLED AFTER WE HAD PRESENTED THEM WITH SOME SCARLET CLOTH WHICH THEY IMMEDIATELY TIED ROUND THEIR NECKS THEY BECAME GOOD FRIENDS THIS WAS SHOWN BY THE OLD MAN PATTING OUR BREASTS
1723-141149-0014 AS PEOPLE DO WHEN FEEDING CHICKENS I WALKED WITH THE OLD MAN AND THIS DEMONSTRATION OF FRIENDSHIP WAS REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES IT WAS CONCLUDED BY THREE HARD SLAPS WHICH WERE GIVEN ME ON THE BREAST AND BACK AT THE SAME TIME HE THEN BARED HIS BOSOM FOR ME TO RETURN THE COMPLIMENT WHICH BEING DONE
1723-141149-0015 HE SEEMED HIGHLY PLEASED THE LANGUAGE OF THESE PEOPLE ACCORDING TO OUR NOTIONS SCARCELY DESERVES TO BE CALLED ARTICULATE CAPTAIN COOK HAS COMPARED IT TO A MAN CLEARING HIS THROAT BUT CERTAINLY NO EUROPEAN EVER CLEARED HIS THROAT WITH SO MANY HOARSE GUTTURAL AND CLICKING SOUNDS
1723-141149-0016 THEY ARE EXCELLENT MIMICS AS OFTEN AS WE COUGHED OR YAWNED OR MADE ANY ODD MOTION THEY IMMEDIATELY IMITATED US SOME OF OUR PARTY BEGAN TO SQUINT AND LOOK AWRY BUT ONE OF THE YOUNG FUEGIANS WHOSE WHOLE FACE WAS PAINTED BLACK EXCEPTING A WHITE BAND ACROSS HIS EYES
1723-141149-0017 SUCCEEDED IN MAKING FAR MORE HIDEOUS GRIMACES THEY COULD REPEAT WITH PERFECT CORRECTNESS EACH WORD IN ANY SENTENCE WE ADDRESSED THEM AND THEY REMEMBERED SUCH WORDS FOR SOME TIME YET WE EUROPEANS ALL KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO DISTINGUISH APART THE SOUNDS IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE
1723-141149-0018 WHICH OF US FOR INSTANCE COULD FOLLOW AN AMERICAN INDIAN THROUGH A SENTENCE OF MORE THAN THREE WORDS ALL SAVAGES APPEAR TO POSSESS TO AN UNCOMMON DEGREE THIS POWER OF MIMICRY I WAS TOLD ALMOST IN THE SAME WORDS OF THE SAME LUDICROUS HABIT AMONG THE CAFFRES
1723-141149-0019 THE AUSTRALIANS LIKEWISE HAVE LONG BEEN NOTORIOUS FOR BEING ABLE TO IMITATE AND DESCRIBE THE GAIT OF ANY MAN SO THAT HE MAY BE RECOGNIZED HOW CAN THIS FACULTY BE EXPLAINED IS IT A CONSEQUENCE OF THE MORE PRACTISED HABITS OF PERCEPTION AND KEENER SENSES COMMON TO ALL MEN IN A SAVAGE STATE
1723-141149-0020 AS COMPARED WITH THOSE LONG CIVILIZED WHEN A SONG WAS STRUCK UP BY OUR PARTY I THOUGHT THE FUEGIANS WOULD HAVE FALLEN DOWN WITH ASTONISHMENT WITH EQUAL SURPRISE THEY VIEWED OUR DANCING BUT ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN WHEN ASKED HAD NO OBJECTION TO A LITTLE WALTZING
1723-141149-0021 LITTLE ACCUSTOMED TO EUROPEANS AS THEY APPEARED TO BE YET THEY KNEW AND DREADED OUR FIRE ARMS NOTHING WOULD TEMPT THEM TO TAKE A GUN IN THEIR HANDS THEY BEGGED FOR KNIVES CALLING THEM BY THE SPANISH WORD
1723-141149-0022 THEY EXPLAINED ALSO WHAT THEY WANTED BY ACTING AS IF THEY HAD A PIECE OF BLUBBER IN THEIR MOUTH AND THEN PRETENDING TO CUT INSTEAD OF TEAR IT I HAVE NOT AS YET NOTICED THE FUEGIANS WHOM WE HAD ON BOARD
1723-141149-0023 DURING THE FORMER VOYAGE OF THE ADVENTURE AND BEAGLE IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX TO EIGHTEEN THIRTY CAPTAIN FITZ ROY SEIZED ON A PARTY OF NATIVES AS HOSTAGES FOR THE LOSS OF A BOAT WHICH HAD BEEN STOLEN TO THE GREAT JEOPARDY OF A PARTY EMPLOYED ON THE SURVEY
1723-141149-0024 AND SOME OF THESE NATIVES AS WELL AS A CHILD WHOM HE BOUGHT FOR A PEARL BUTTON HE TOOK WITH HIM TO ENGLAND DETERMINING TO EDUCATE THEM AND INSTRUCT THEM IN RELIGION AT HIS OWN EXPENSE TO SETTLE THESE NATIVES IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY
1723-141149-0025 WAS ONE CHIEF INDUCEMENT TO CAPTAIN FITZ ROY TO UNDERTAKE OUR PRESENT VOYAGE AND BEFORE THE ADMIRALTY HAD RESOLVED TO SEND OUT THIS EXPEDITION CAPTAIN FITZ ROY HAD GENEROUSLY CHARTERED A VESSEL AND WOULD HIMSELF HAVE TAKEN THEM BACK THE NATIVES WERE ACCOMPANIED BY A MISSIONARY
1723-141149-0026 R MATTHEWS OF WHOM AND OF THE NATIVES CAPTAIN FITZ ROY HAS PUBLISHED A FULL AND EXCELLENT ACCOUNT TWO MEN ONE OF WHOM DIED IN ENGLAND OF THE SMALL POX A BOY AND A LITTLE GIRL WERE ORIGINALLY TAKEN AND WE HAD NOW ON BOARD
1723-141149-0027 YORK MINSTER JEMMY BUTTON WHOSE NAME EXPRESSES HIS PURCHASE MONEY AND FUEGIA BASKET YORK MINSTER WAS A FULL GROWN SHORT THICK POWERFUL MAN HIS DISPOSITION WAS RESERVED TACITURN MOROSE
1723-141149-0028 AND WHEN EXCITED VIOLENTLY PASSIONATE HIS AFFECTIONS WERE VERY STRONG TOWARDS A FEW FRIENDS ON BOARD HIS INTELLECT GOOD JEMMY BUTTON WAS A UNIVERSAL FAVOURITE BUT LIKEWISE PASSIONATE THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE AT ONCE SHOWED HIS NICE DISPOSITION
1723-141149-0029 HE WAS MERRY AND OFTEN LAUGHED AND WAS REMARKABLY SYMPATHETIC WITH ANY ONE IN PAIN WHEN THE WATER WAS ROUGH I WAS OFTEN A LITTLE SEA SICK AND HE USED TO COME TO ME AND SAY IN A PLAINTIVE VOICE POOR POOR FELLOW BUT THE NOTION AFTER HIS AQUATIC LIFE
1723-141149-0030 OF A MAN BEING SEA SICK WAS TOO LUDICROUS AND HE WAS GENERALLY OBLIGED TO TURN ON ONE SIDE TO HIDE A SMILE OR LAUGH
1723-141149-0031 POOR POOR FELLOW HE WAS OF A PATRIOTIC DISPOSITION AND HE LIKED TO PRAISE HIS OWN TRIBE AND COUNTRY
1723-141149-0032 AND HE ABUSED ALL THE OTHER TRIBES HE STOUTLY DECLARED THAT THERE WAS NO DEVIL IN HIS LAND JEMMY WAS SHORT THICK AND FAT BUT VAIN OF HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE HE USED ALWAYS TO WEAR GLOVES
1723-141149-0033 HIS HAIR WAS NEATLY CUT AND HE WAS DISTRESSED IF HIS WELL POLISHED SHOES WERE DIRTIED HE WAS FOND OF ADMIRING HIMSELF IN A LOOKING GLASS AND A MERRY FACED LITTLE INDIAN BOY FROM THE RIO NEGRO WHOM WE HAD FOR SOME MONTHS ON BOARD SOON PERCEIVED THIS AND USED TO MOCK HIM
1723-141149-0034 TOO MUCH SKYLARK IT SEEMS YET WONDERFUL TO ME WHEN I THINK OVER ALL HIS MANY GOOD QUALITIES THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OF THE SAME RACE AND DOUBTLESS PARTAKEN OF THE SAME CHARACTER WITH THE MISERABLE DEGRADED SAVAGES WHOM WE FIRST MET HERE LASTLY
1723-141149-0035 FUEGIA BASKET WAS A NICE MODEST RESERVED YOUNG GIRL WITH A RATHER PLEASING BUT SOMETIMES SULLEN EXPRESSION AND VERY QUICK IN LEARNING ANYTHING ESPECIALLY LANGUAGES THIS SHE SHOWED IN PICKING UP SOME PORTUGUESE AND SPANISH
1723-141149-0036 ALTHOUGH ALL THREE COULD BOTH SPEAK AND UNDERSTAND A GOOD DEAL OF ENGLISH IT WAS SINGULARLY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN MUCH INFORMATION FROM THEM CONCERNING THE HABITS OF THEIR COUNTRYMEN THIS WAS PARTLY OWING TO THEIR APPARENT DIFFICULTY IN UNDERSTANDING THE SIMPLEST ALTERNATIVE
1723-141149-0037 EVERY ONE ACCUSTOMED TO VERY YOUNG CHILDREN KNOWS HOW SELDOM ONE CAN GET AN ANSWER EVEN TO SO SIMPLE A QUESTION AS WHETHER A THING IS BLACK OR WHITE THE IDEA OF BLACK OR WHITE SEEMS ALTERNATELY TO FILL THEIR MINDS SO IT WAS WITH THESE FUEGIANS
1723-141149-0038 AND HENCE IT WAS GENERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND OUT BY CROSS QUESTIONING WHETHER ONE HAD RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD ANYTHING WHICH THEY HAD ASSERTED THEIR SIGHT WAS REMARKABLY ACUTE IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT SAILORS FROM LONG PRACTICE CAN MAKE OUT A DISTANT OBJECT MUCH BETTER THAN A LANDSMAN
1723-141149-0039 AND JEMMY WHEN HE HAD ANY LITTLE QUARREL WITH THE OFFICER ON WATCH WOULD SAY ME SEE SHIP ME NO TELL IT WAS INTERESTING TO WATCH THE CONDUCT OF THE SAVAGES WHEN WE LANDED TOWARDS JEMMY BUTTON
1723-141149-0040 THEY IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM AND OURSELVES AND HELD MUCH CONVERSATION ONE WITH ANOTHER ON THE SUBJECT THE OLD MAN ADDRESSED A LONG HARANGUE TO JEMMY WHICH IT SEEMS WAS TO INVITE HIM TO STAY WITH THEM
1723-141149-0041 BUT JEMMY UNDERSTOOD VERY LITTLE OF THEIR LANGUAGE AND WAS MOREOVER THOROUGHLY ASHAMED OF HIS COUNTRYMEN WHEN YORK MINSTER AFTERWARDS CAME ON SHORE THEY NOTICED HIM IN THE SAME WAY AND TOLD HIM HE OUGHT TO SHAVE YET HE HAD NOT TWENTY DWARF HAIRS ON HIS FACE WHILST WE ALL WORE OUR UNTRIMMED BEARDS
1723-141149-0042 THEY EXAMINED THE COLOUR OF HIS SKIN AND COMPARED IT WITH OURS ONE OF OUR ARMS BEING BARED THEY EXPRESSED THE LIVELIEST SURPRISE AND ADMIRATION AT ITS WHITENESS JUST IN THE SAME WAY IN WHICH I HAVE SEEN THE OURANGOUTANG DO AT THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS
1723-141149-0043 WE THOUGHT THAT THEY MISTOOK TWO OR THREE OF THE OFFICERS WHO WERE RATHER SHORTER AND FAIRER THOUGH ADORNED WITH LARGE BEARDS FOR THE LADIES OF OUR PARTY
1723-141149-0044 THAT I DARE SAY HE THOUGHT HIMSELF THE HANDSOMEST MAN IN TIERRA DEL FUEGO AFTER OUR FIRST FEELING OF GRAVE ASTONISHMENT WAS OVER NOTHING COULD BE MORE LUDICROUS THAN THE ODD MIXTURE OF SURPRISE AND IMITATION WHICH THESE SAVAGES EVERY MOMENT EXHIBITED
1723-141149-0045 THE NEXT DAY I ATTEMPTED TO PENETRATE SOME WAY INTO THE COUNTRY TIERRA DEL FUEGO MAY BE DESCRIBED AS A MOUNTAINOUS LAND PARTLY SUBMERGED IN THE SEA SO THAT DEEP INLETS AND BAYS OCCUPY THE PLACE WHERE VALLEYS SHOULD EXIST
1723-141149-0046 THE MOUNTAIN SIDES EXCEPT ON THE EXPOSED WESTERN COAST ARE COVERED FROM THE WATER'S EDGE UPWARDS BY ONE GREAT FOREST
1723-141149-0047 AND ARE SUCCEEDED BY A BAND OF PEAT WITH MINUTE ALPINE PLANTS AND THIS AGAIN IS SUCCEEDED BY THE LINE OF PERPETUAL SNOW WHICH ACCORDING TO CAPTAIN KING IN THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN DESCENDS TO BETWEEN THREE THOUSAND AND FOUR THOUSAND FEET
1723-141149-0048 IS MOST RARE I RECOLLECT ONLY ONE LITTLE FLAT PIECE NEAR PORT FAMINE AND ANOTHER OF RATHER LARGER EXTENT NEAR GOEREE ROAD IN BOTH PLACES AND EVERYWHERE ELSE THE SURFACE IS COVERED BY A THICK BED OF SWAMPY PEAT EVEN WITHIN THE FOREST
1723-141149-0049 THE GROUND IS CONCEALED BY A MASS OF SLOWLY PUTREFYING VEGETABLE MATTER WHICH FROM BEING SOAKED WITH WATER YIELDS TO THE FOOT FINDING IT NEARLY HOPELESS TO PUSH MY WAY THROUGH THE WOOD I FOLLOWED THE COURSE OF A MOUNTAIN TORRENT
1723-141149-0050 AT FIRST FROM THE WATERFALLS AND NUMBER OF DEAD TREES I COULD HARDLY CRAWL ALONG BUT THE BED OF THE STREAM SOON BECAME A LITTLE MORE OPEN FROM THE FLOODS HAVING SWEPT THE SIDES I CONTINUED SLOWLY TO ADVANCE FOR AN HOUR ALONG THE BROKEN AND ROCKY BANKS
1723-141149-0051 AND WAS AMPLY REPAID BY THE GRANDEUR OF THE SCENE THE GLOOMY DEPTH OF THE RAVINE WELL ACCORDED WITH THE UNIVERSAL SIGNS OF VIOLENCE ON EVERY SIDE WERE LYING IRREGULAR MASSES OF ROCK AND TORN UP TREES OTHER TREES THOUGH STILL ERECT
1723-141149-0052 WERE DECAYED TO THE HEART AND READY TO FALL THE ENTANGLED MASS OF THE THRIVING AND THE FALLEN REMINDED ME OF THE FORESTS WITHIN THE TROPICS YET THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE FOR IN THESE STILL SOLITUDES DEATH INSTEAD OF LIFE SEEMED THE PREDOMINANT SPIRIT
1723-141149-0053 HAD CLEARED A STRAIGHT SPACE DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE BY THIS ROAD I ASCENDED TO A CONSIDERABLE ELEVATION AND OBTAINED A GOOD VIEW OF THE SURROUNDING WOODS THE TREES ALL BELONG TO ONE KIND THE FAGUS BETULOIDES
1723-141149-0054 FOR THE NUMBER OF THE OTHER SPECIES OF FAGUS AND OF THE WINTER'S BARK IS QUITE INCONSIDERABLE THIS BEECH KEEPS ITS LEAVES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BUT ITS FOLIAGE IS OF A PECULIAR BROWNISH GREEN COLOUR WITH A TINGE OF YELLOW AS THE WHOLE LANDSCAPE IS THUS COLOURED
1723-141149-0055 IT HAS A SOMBRE DULL APPEARANCE NOR IS IT OFTEN ENLIVENED BY THE RAYS OF THE SUN
1723-141149-0056 ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET HIGH WHICH CAPTAIN FITZ ROY HAS CALLED AFTER SIR J BANKS IN COMMEMORATION OF HIS DISASTROUS EXCURSION WHICH PROVED FATAL TO TWO MEN OF HIS PARTY AND NEARLY SO TO DOCTOR SOLANDER THE SNOW STORM WHICH WAS THE CAUSE OF THEIR MISFORTUNE
1723-141149-0057 WE FOLLOWED THE SAME WATER COURSE AS ON THE PREVIOUS DAY TILL IT DWINDLED AWAY AND WE WERE THEN COMPELLED TO CRAWL BLINDLY AMONG THE TREES THESE FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE ELEVATION AND OF THE IMPETUOUS WINDS WERE LOW THICK AND CROOKED
1723-141149-0058 AT LENGTH WE REACHED THAT WHICH FROM A DISTANCE APPEARED LIKE A CARPET OF FINE GREEN TURF BUT WHICH TO OUR VEXATION TURNED OUT TO BE A COMPACT MASS OF LITTLE BEECH TREES ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE FEET HIGH
1723-141149-0059 THEY WERE AS THICK TOGETHER AS BOX IN THE BORDER OF A GARDEN AND WE WERE OBLIGED TO STRUGGLE OVER THE FLAT BUT TREACHEROUS SURFACE
1723-141149-0060 A RIDGE CONNECTED THIS HILL WITH ANOTHER DISTANT SOME MILES AND MORE LOFTY SO THAT PATCHES OF SNOW WERE LYING ON IT AS THE DAY WAS NOT FAR ADVANCED I DETERMINED TO WALK THERE AND COLLECT PLANTS ALONG THE ROAD
1723-141149-0061 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HARD WORK HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR A WELL BEATEN AND STRAIGHT PATH MADE BY THE GUANACOS FOR THESE ANIMALS LIKE SHEEP ALWAYS FOLLOW THE SAME LINE WHEN WE REACHED THE HILL WE FOUND IT THE HIGHEST IN THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD
1723-141149-0062 AND THE WATERS FLOWED TO THE SEA IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS WE OBTAINED A WIDE VIEW OVER THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY TO THE NORTH A SWAMPY MOORLAND EXTENDED
1723-141149-0063 WELL BECOMING TIERRA DEL FUEGO THERE WAS A DEGREE OF MYSTERIOUS GRANDEUR IN MOUNTAIN BEHIND MOUNTAIN WITH THE DEEP INTERVENING VALLEYS ALL COVERED BY ONE THICK DUSKY MASS OF FOREST THE ATMOSPHERE LIKEWISE IN THIS CLIMATE
1723-141149-0064 WHERE GALE SUCCEEDS GALE WITH RAIN HAIL AND SLEET SEEMS BLACKER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN LOOKING DUE SOUTHWARD FROM PORT FAMINE THE DISTANT CHANNELS BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS APPEARED FROM THEIR GLOOMINESS TO LEAD BEYOND THE CONFINES OF THIS WORLD
1723-141149-0065 AND ON THE SUCCEEDING DAY FAVOURED TO AN UNCOMMON DEGREE BY A FINE EASTERLY BREEZE WE CLOSED IN WITH THE BARNEVELTS AND RUNNING PAST CAPE DECEIT WITH ITS STONY PEAKS ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK DOUBLED THE WEATHER BEATEN CAPE HORN THE EVENING WAS CALM AND BRIGHT
1723-141149-0066 AND WE ENJOYED A FINE VIEW OF THE SURROUNDING ISLES CAPE HORN HOWEVER DEMANDED HIS TRIBUTE AND BEFORE NIGHT SENT US A GALE OF WIND DIRECTLY IN OUR TEETH WE STOOD OUT TO SEA AND ON THE SECOND DAY AGAIN MADE THE LAND
1723-141149-0067 WHEN WE SAW ON OUR WEATHER BOW THIS NOTORIOUS PROMONTORY IN ITS PROPER FORM VEILED IN A MIST AND ITS DIM OUTLINE SURROUNDED BY A STORM OF WIND AND WATER GREAT BLACK CLOUDS WERE ROLLING ACROSS THE HEAVENS AND SQUALLS OF RAIN WITH HAIL
1723-141149-0068 THAT THE CAPTAIN DETERMINED TO RUN INTO WIGWAM COVE THIS IS A SNUG LITTLE HARBOUR NOT FAR FROM CAPE HORN AND HERE AT CHRISTMAS EVE WE ANCHORED IN SMOOTH WATER THE ONLY THING WHICH REMINDED US OF THE GALE OUTSIDE
1723-141149-0069 WAS EVERY NOW AND THEN A PUFF FROM THE MOUNTAINS WHICH MADE THE SHIP SURGE AT HER ANCHORS
1723-141149-0070 RISES TO THE HEIGHT OF SEVENTEEN HUNDRED FEET THE SURROUNDING ISLANDS ALL CONSIST OF CONICAL MASSES OF GREENSTONE ASSOCIATED SOMETIMES WITH LESS REGULAR HILLS OF BAKED AND ALTERED CLAY SLATE THIS PART OF TIERRA DEL FUEGO
1723-141149-0071 MAY BE CONSIDERED AS THE EXTREMITY OF THE SUBMERGED CHAIN OF MOUNTAINS ALREADY ALLUDED TO THE COVE TAKES ITS NAME OF WIGWAM FROM SOME OF THE FUEGIAN HABITATIONS BUT EVERY BAY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD MIGHT BE SO CALLED WITH EQUAL PROPRIETY THE INHABITANTS
1723-141149-0072 LIVING CHIEFLY UPON SHELL FISH ARE OBLIGED CONSTANTLY TO CHANGE THEIR PLACE OF RESIDENCE BUT THEY RETURN AT INTERVALS TO THE SAME SPOTS AS IS EVIDENT FROM THE PILES OF OLD SHELLS WHICH MUST OFTEN AMOUNT TO MANY TONS IN FREIGHT
1723-141149-0073 THE FUEGIAN WIGWAM RESEMBLES IN SIZE AND DIMENSIONS A HAYCOCK IT MERELY CONSISTS OF A FEW BROKEN BRANCHES STUCK IN THE GROUND AND VERY IMPERFECTLY THATCHED ON ONE SIDE WITH A FEW TUFTS OF GRASS AND RUSHES THE WHOLE CANNOT BE THE WORK OF AN HOUR
1723-141149-0074 AND IT IS ONLY USED FOR A FEW DAYS AT GOEREE ROADS I SAW A PLACE WHERE ONE OF THESE NAKED MEN HAD SLEPT WHICH ABSOLUTELY OFFERED NO MORE COVER THAN THE FORM OF A HARE THE MAN WAS EVIDENTLY LIVING BY HIMSELF
1723-141149-0075 ON THE WEST COAST HOWEVER THE WIGWAMS ARE RATHER BETTER FOR THEY ARE COVERED WITH SEAL SKINS WE WERE DETAINED HERE SEVERAL DAYS BY THE BAD WEATHER THE CLIMATE IS CERTAINLY WRETCHED THE SUMMER SOLSTICE WAS NOW PASSED
1723-141149-0076 YET EVERY DAY SNOW FELL ON THE HILLS AND IN THE VALLEYS THERE WAS RAIN ACCOMPANIED BY SLEET THE THERMOMETER GENERALLY STOOD
1723-141149-0077 FROM THE DAMP AND BOISTEROUS STATE OF THE ATMOSPHERE
1723-141149-0078 ONE FANCIED THE CLIMATE EVEN WORSE THAN IT REALLY WAS WHILE GOING ONE DAY ON SHORE NEAR WOLLASTON ISLAND WE PULLED ALONGSIDE A CANOE WITH SIX FUEGIANS THESE WERE THE MOST ABJECT AND MISERABLE CREATURES I ANYWHERE BEHELD
1723-141149-0079 ON THE EAST COAST THE NATIVES AS WE HAVE SEEN HAVE GUANACO CLOAKS AND ON THE WEST THEY POSSESS SEAL SKINS AMONGST THESE CENTRAL TRIBES THE MEN GENERALLY HAVE AN OTTER SKIN OR SOME SMALL SCRAP ABOUT AS LARGE AS A POCKET HANDKERCHIEF
1723-141149-0080 WHICH IS BARELY SUFFICIENT TO COVER THEIR BACKS AS LOW DOWN AS THEIR LOINS IT IS LACED ACROSS THE BREAST BY STRINGS AND ACCORDING AS THE WIND BLOWS IT IS SHIFTED FROM SIDE TO SIDE BUT THESE FUEGIANS IN THE CANOE WERE QUITE NAKED AND EVEN ONE FULL GROWN WOMAN WAS ABSOLUTELY SO
1723-141149-0081 IT WAS RAINING HEAVILY AND THE FRESH WATER TOGETHER WITH THE SPRAY TRICKLED DOWN HER BODY IN ANOTHER HARBOUR NOT FAR DISTANT A WOMAN WHO WAS SUCKLING A RECENTLY BORN CHILD CAME ONE DAY ALONGSIDE THE VESSEL AND REMAINED THERE OUT OF MERE CURIOSITY
1723-141149-0082 THEIR VOICES DISCORDANT AND THEIR GESTURES VIOLENT VIEWING SUCH MEN ONE CAN HARDLY MAKE ONE'S SELF BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE FELLOW CREATURES AND INHABITANTS OF THE SAME WORLD IT IS A COMMON SUBJECT OF CONJECTURE WHAT PLEASURE IN LIFE SOME OF THE LOWER ANIMALS CAN ENJOY
1723-141149-0083 HOW MUCH MORE REASONABLY THE SAME QUESTION MAY BE ASKED WITH RESPECT TO THESE BARBARIANS AT NIGHT FIVE OR SIX HUMAN BEINGS NAKED AND SCARCELY PROTECTED FROM THE WIND AND RAIN OF THIS TEMPESTUOUS CLIMATE SLEEP ON THE WET GROUND COILED UP LIKE ANIMALS
1723-141149-0084 WHENEVER IT IS LOW WATER WINTER OR SUMMER NIGHT OR DAY THEY MUST RISE TO PICK SHELL FISH FROM THE ROCKS AND THE WOMEN EITHER DIVE TO COLLECT SEA EGGS OR SIT PATIENTLY IN THEIR CANOES AND WITH A BAITED HAIR LINE WITHOUT ANY HOOK JERK OUT LITTLE FISH
1723-141149-0085 IF A SEAL IS KILLED OR THE FLOATING CARCASS OF A PUTRID WHALE IS DISCOVERED IT IS A FEAST AND SUCH MISERABLE FOOD IS ASSISTED BY A FEW TASTELESS BERRIES AND FUNGI THEY OFTEN SUFFER FROM FAMINE
1723-141149-0086 I HEARD MISTER LOW A SEALING MASTER INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH THE NATIVES OF THIS COUNTRY GIVE A CURIOUS ACCOUNT OF THE STATE OF A PARTY OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NATIVES ON THE WEST COAST WHO WERE VERY THIN AND IN GREAT DISTRESS
1723-141149-0087 A SUCCESSION OF GALES PREVENTED THE WOMEN FROM GETTING SHELL FISH ON THE ROCKS AND THEY COULD NOT GO OUT IN THEIR CANOES TO CATCH SEAL A SMALL PARTY OF THESE MEN ONE MORNING SET OUT AND THE OTHER INDIANS EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT THEY WERE GOING A FOUR DAYS JOURNEY FOR FOOD
1723-141149-0088 AS SOON AS THE BLUBBER WAS BROUGHT INTO A WIGWAM AN OLD MAN CUT OFF THIN SLICES AND MUTTERING OVER THEM BROILED THEM FOR A MINUTE
1723-141149-0089 WHO DURING THIS TIME PRESERVED A PROFOUND SILENCE MISTER LOW BELIEVES THAT WHENEVER A WHALE IS CAST ON SHORE THE NATIVES BURY LARGE PIECES OF IT IN THE SAND AS A RESOURCE IN TIME OF FAMINE AND A NATIVE BOY WHOM HE HAD ON BOARD ONCE FOUND A STOCK THUS BURIED
1723-141149-0090 THE DIFFERENT TRIBES WHEN AT WAR ARE CANNIBALS FROM THE CONCURRENT BUT QUITE INDEPENDENT EVIDENCE OF THE BOY TAKEN BY MISTER LOW AND OF JEMMY BUTTON IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT WHEN PRESSED IN WINTER BY HUNGER
1723-141149-0091 THEY KILL AND DEVOUR THEIR OLD WOMEN BEFORE THEY KILL THEIR DOGS THE BOY BEING ASKED BY MISTER LOW WHY THEY DID THIS ANSWERED DOGGIES CATCH OTTERS OLD WOMEN NO THIS BOY DESCRIBED THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY ARE KILLED BY BEING HELD OVER SMOKE AND THUS CHOKED
1723-141149-0092 HE IMITATED THEIR SCREAMS AS A JOKE AND DESCRIBED THE PARTS OF THEIR BODIES WHICH ARE CONSIDERED BEST TO EAT HORRID AS SUCH A DEATH BY THE HANDS OF THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES MUST BE THE FEARS OF THE OLD WOMEN WHEN HUNGER BEGINS TO PRESS ARE MORE PAINFUL TO THINK OF
1723-141149-0093 BUT THAT THEY ARE PURSUED BY THE MEN AND BROUGHT BACK TO THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE AT THEIR OWN FIRESIDES CAPTAIN FITZ ROY COULD NEVER ASCERTAIN THAT THE FUEGIANS HAVE ANY DISTINCT BELIEF IN A FUTURE LIFE THEY SOMETIMES BURY THEIR DEAD IN CAVES
1723-141149-0094 AND SOMETIMES IN THE MOUNTAIN FORESTS WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT CEREMONIES THEY PERFORM JEMMY BUTTON WOULD NOT EAT LAND BIRDS BECAUSE EAT DEAD MEN THEY ARE UNWILLING EVEN TO MENTION THEIR DEAD FRIENDS WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THEY PERFORM ANY SORT OF RELIGIOUS WORSHIP
1723-141149-0095 THOUGH PERHAPS THE MUTTERING OF THE OLD MAN BEFORE HE DISTRIBUTED THE PUTRID BLUBBER TO HIS FAMISHED PARTY MAY BE OF THIS NATURE EACH FAMILY OR TRIBE HAS A WIZARD OR CONJURING DOCTOR WHOSE OFFICE WE COULD NEVER CLEARLY ASCERTAIN JEMMY BELIEVED IN DREAMS
1723-141149-0096 THOUGH NOT AS I HAVE SAID IN THE DEVIL I DO NOT THINK THAT OUR FUEGIANS WERE MUCH MORE SUPERSTITIOUS THAN SOME OF THE SAILORS FOR AN OLD QUARTERMASTER FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT THE SUCCESSIVE HEAVY GALES WHICH WE ENCOUNTERED OFF CAPE HORN WERE CAUSED BY OUR HAVING THE FUEGIANS ON BOARD
1723-141149-0097 THE NEAREST APPROACH TO A RELIGIOUS FEELING WHICH I HEARD OF WAS SHOWN BY YORK MINSTER
1723-141149-0098 IN A WILD AND EXCITED MANNER HE ALSO RELATED THAT HIS BROTHER ONE DAY WHILST RETURNING TO PICK UP SOME DEAD BIRDS WHICH HE HAD LEFT ON THE COAST OBSERVED SOME FEATHERS BLOWN BY THE WIND HIS BROTHER SAID YORK IMITATING HIS MANNER WHAT THAT
1723-141149-0099 AND CRAWLING ONWARDS HE PEEPED OVER THE CLIFF AND SAW WILD MAN PICKING HIS BIRDS HE CRAWLED A LITTLE NEARER AND THEN HURLED DOWN A GREAT STONE AND KILLED HIM YORK DECLARED FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARDS STORMS RAGED AND MUCH RAIN AND SNOW FELL
1723-141149-0100 AS FAR AS WE COULD MAKE OUT HE SEEMED TO CONSIDER THE ELEMENTS THEMSELVES AS THE AVENGING AGENTS IT IS EVIDENT IN THIS CASE HOW NATURALLY IN A RACE A LITTLE MORE ADVANCED IN CULTURE THE ELEMENTS WOULD BECOME PERSONIFIED WHAT THE BAD WILD MEN WERE
1723-141149-0101 HAS ALWAYS APPEARED TO ME MOST MYSTERIOUS FROM WHAT YORK SAID WHEN WE FOUND THE PLACE LIKE THE FORM OF A HARE WHERE A SINGLE MAN HAD SLEPT THE NIGHT BEFORE
1723-141149-0102 BUT OTHER OBSCURE SPEECHES MADE ME DOUBT THIS I HAVE SOMETIMES IMAGINED THAT THE MOST PROBABLE EXPLANATION WAS THAT THEY WERE INSANE THE DIFFERENT TRIBES HAVE NO GOVERNMENT OR CHIEF YET EACH IS SURROUNDED BY OTHER HOSTILE TRIBES SPEAKING DIFFERENT DIALECTS
1723-141149-0103 AND SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER ONLY BY A DESERTED BORDER OR NEUTRAL TERRITORY THE CAUSE OF THEIR WARFARE APPEARS TO BE THE MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE THEIR COUNTRY IS A BROKEN MASS OF WILD ROCKS LOFTY HILLS AND USELESS FORESTS
1723-141149-0104 AND THESE ARE VIEWED THROUGH MISTS AND ENDLESS STORMS THE HABITABLE LAND IS REDUCED TO THE STONES ON THE BEACH IN SEARCH OF FOOD THEY ARE COMPELLED UNCEASINGLY TO WANDER FROM SPOT TO SPOT AND SO STEEP IS THE COAST THAT THEY CAN ONLY MOVE ABOUT IN THEIR WRETCHED CANOES
1723-141149-0105 THEY CANNOT KNOW THE FEELING OF HAVING A HOME AND STILL LESS THAT OF DOMESTIC AFFECTION FOR THE HUSBAND IS TO THE WIFE A BRUTAL MASTER TO A LABORIOUS SLAVE WAS A MORE HORRID DEED EVER PERPETRATED THAN THAT WITNESSED ON THE WEST COAST BY BYRON
1723-141149-0106 WHO SAW A WRETCHED MOTHER PICK UP HER BLEEDING DYING INFANT BOY WHOM HER HUSBAND HAD MERCILESSLY DASHED ON THE STONES FOR DROPPING A BASKET OF SEA EGGS HOW LITTLE CAN THE HIGHER POWERS OF THE MIND BE BROUGHT INTO PLAY WHAT IS THERE FOR IMAGINATION TO PICTURE
1723-141149-0107 FOR REASON TO COMPARE OR JUDGMENT TO DECIDE UPON TO KNOCK A LIMPET FROM THE ROCK DOES NOT REQUIRE EVEN CUNNING THAT LOWEST POWER OF THE MIND THEIR SKILL IN SOME RESPECTS MAY BE COMPARED TO THE INSTINCT OF ANIMALS FOR IT IS NOT IMPROVED BY EXPERIENCE
1723-141149-0108 THE CANOE THEIR MOST INGENIOUS WORK POOR AS IT IS HAS REMAINED THE SAME AS WE KNOW FROM DRAKE FOR THE LAST TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS WHILST BEHOLDING THESE SAVAGES ONE ASKS WHENCE HAVE THEY COME WHAT COULD HAVE TEMPTED
1723-141149-0109 OR WHAT CHANGE COMPELLED A TRIBE OF MEN TO LEAVE THE FINE REGIONS OF THE NORTH TO TRAVEL DOWN THE CORDILLERA OR BACKBONE OF AMERICA TO INVENT AND BUILD CANOES WHICH ARE NOT USED BY THE TRIBES OF CHILE PERU AND BRAZIL
1723-141149-0110 AND THEN TO ENTER ON ONE OF THE MOST INHOSPITABLE COUNTRIES WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE GLOBE ALTHOUGH SUCH REFLECTIONS MUST AT FIRST SEIZE ON THE MIND YET WE MAY FEEL SURE THAT THEY ARE PARTLY ERRONEOUS THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE FUEGIANS DECREASE IN NUMBER
1723-141149-0111 THEREFORE WE MUST SUPPOSE THAT THEY ENJOY A SUFFICIENT SHARE OF HAPPINESS OF WHATEVER KIND IT MAY BE TO RENDER LIFE WORTH HAVING
1743-142912-0000 AND NOW OUR FAMILY IS VERY WELL REPRESENTED IN THE OLD ORCHARD SAID CHEBEC PROUDLY SLOWLY PETER REACHED OVER HIS BACK WITH HIS LONG LEFT HIND FOOT AND THOUGHTFULLY SCRATCHED HIS LONG RIGHT EAR
1743-142912-0001 HE DIDN'T LIKE TO ADMIT THAT HE COULDN'T RECALL THOSE TWO COUSINS OF CHEBEC'S DID YOU SAY YOUR FIGHTING COUSIN HE ASKED IN A HESITATING WAY THAT'S WHAT I SAID REPLIED CHEBEC HE IS SCRAPPER THE KINGBIRD AS OF COURSE YOU KNOW
1743-142912-0002 THE REST OF US ALWAYS FEEL SAFE WHEN HE IS ABOUT OF COURSE I KNOW HIM DECLARED PETER HIS FACE CLEARING WHERE IS HE NOW
1743-142912-0003 AT THAT VERY INSTANT A GREAT RACKET BROKE OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OLD ORCHARD AND IN NO TIME AT ALL THE FEATHERED FOLKS WERE HURRYING FROM EVERY DIRECTION SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF THEIR VOICES
1743-142912-0004 OF COURSE PETER COULDN'T BE LEFT OUT OF ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND HE SCAMPERED FOR THE SCENE OF TROUBLE AS FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD TAKE HIM
1743-142912-0005 AND THIS WAY AND THAT WAY AS IF TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM SOMETHING OR SOMEBODY FOR A MINUTE PETER COULDN'T THINK WHAT WAS THE TROUBLE WITH REDTAIL AND THEN HE SAW
1743-142912-0006 A WHITE THROATED WHITE BREASTED BIRD HAVING A BLACK CAP AND BACK AND A BROAD WHITE BAND ACROSS THE END OF HIS TAIL WAS DARTING AT REDTAIL AS IF HE MEANT TO PULL OUT EVERY FEATHER IN THE LATTER'S COAT
1743-142912-0007 HE WAS JUST A LITTLE SMALLER THAN WELCOME ROBIN AND IN COMPARISON WITH HIM REDTAIL WAS A PERFECT GIANT BUT THIS SEEMED TO MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO SCRAPPER FOR THAT IS WHO IT WAS
1743-142912-0008 HE WASN'T AFRAID AND HE INTENDED THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW IT ESPECIALLY REDTAIL IT IS BECAUSE OF HIS FEARLESSNESS THAT HE IS CALLED KINGBIRD ALL THE TIME HE WAS SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS CALLING REDTAIL A ROBBER AND EVERY OTHER BAD NAME HE COULD THINK OF
1743-142912-0009 ALL THE OTHER BIRDS JOINED HIM IN CALLING REDTAIL BAD NAMES BUT NONE NOT EVEN BULLY THE ENGLISH SPARROW WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO JOIN HIM IN ATTACKING BIG REDTAIL WHEN HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRIVING REDTAIL FAR ENOUGH FROM THE OLD ORCHARD TO SUIT HIM
1743-142912-0010 SCRAPPER FLEW BACK AND PERCHED ON A DEAD BRANCH OF ONE OF THE TREES WHERE HE RECEIVED THE CONGRATULATIONS OF ALL HIS FEATHERED NEIGHBORS HE TOOK THEM QUITE MODESTLY ASSURING THEM THAT HE HAD DONE NOTHING
1743-142912-0011 PETER COULDN'T HELP BUT ADMIRE SCRAPPER FOR HIS COURAGE AS PETER LOOKED UP AT SCRAPPER HE SAW THAT LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE FLYCATCHERS THERE WAS JUST THE TINIEST OF HOOKS ON THE END OF HIS BILL
1743-142912-0012 SCRAPPER'S SLIGHTLY RAISED CAP SEEMED ALL BLACK BUT IF PETER COULD HAVE GOTTEN CLOSE ENOUGH HE WOULD HAVE FOUND THAT HIDDEN IN IT WAS A PATCH OF ORANGE RED WHILE PETER SAT STARING UP AT HIM SCRAPPER SUDDENLY DARTED OUT INTO THE AIR
1743-142912-0013 AND HIS BILL SNAPPED IN QUITE THE SAME WAY CHEBEC'S DID WHEN HE CAUGHT A FLY BUT IT WASN'T A FLY THAT SCRAPPER HAD IT WAS A BEE PETER SAW IT VERY DISTINCTLY JUST AS SCRAPPER SNAPPED IT UP
1743-142912-0014 IT REMINDED PETER THAT HE HAD OFTEN HEARD SCRAPPER CALLED THE BEE MARTIN AND NOW HE UNDERSTOOD WHY DO YOU LIVE ON BEES ALTOGETHER ASKED PETER
1743-142912-0015 THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY HONEY IF I DID
1743-142912-0016 THOSE THAT I DO CATCH ARE MOSTLY DRONES AND YOU KNOW THE DRONES ARE USELESS THEY DO NO WORK AT ALL IT IS ONLY BY ACCIDENT THAT I NOW AND THEN CATCH A WORKER I EAT ALL KINDS OF INSECTS THAT FLY AND SOME THAT DON'T
1743-142912-0017 I'M ONE OF FARMER BROWN'S BEST FRIENDS IF HE DID BUT KNOW IT YOU CAN TALK ALL YOU PLEASE ABOUT THE WONDERFUL EYESIGHT OF THE MEMBERS OF THE HAWK FAMILY BUT IF ANY ONE OF THEM HAS BETTER EYESIGHT THAN I HAVE I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHO IT IS
1743-142912-0018 THERE'S A FLY WAY OVER THERE BEYOND THAT OLD APPLE TREE WATCH ME CATCH IT PETER KNEW BETTER THAN TO WASTE ANY EFFORT TRYING TO SEE THAT FLY HE KNEW THAT HE COULDN'T HAVE SEEN IT HAD IT BEEN ONLY ONE FOURTH THAT DISTANCE AWAY
1743-142912-0019 BUT IF HE COULDN'T SEE THE FLY HE COULD HEAR THE SHARP CLICK OF SCRAPPER'S BILL AND HE KNEW BY THE WAY SCRAPPER KEPT OPENING AND SHUTTING HIS MOUTH AFTER HIS RETURN THAT HE HAD CAUGHT THAT FLY AND IT HAD TASTED GOOD
1743-142912-0020 ARE YOU GOING TO BUILD IN THE OLD ORCHARD THIS YEAR ASKED PETER OF COURSE I AM DECLARED SCRAPPER I JUST THEN HE SPIED BLACKY THE CROW AND DASHED OUT TO MEET HIM
1743-142912-0021 TURNING AWAY TOWARD THE GREEN MEADOWS INSTEAD PETER DIDN'T WAIT FOR SCRAPPER TO RETURN
1743-142912-0022 JUST AS HE WAS LEAVING THE FAR CORNER OF THE OLD ORCHARD SOME ONE CALLED HIM PETER OH PETER RABBIT CALLED THE VOICE PETER STOPPED ABRUPTLY SAT UP VERY STRAIGHT LOOKED THIS WAY LOOKED THAT WAY AND LOOKED THE OTHER WAY
1743-142912-0023 EVERY WAY BUT THE RIGHT WAY LOOK UP OVER YOUR HEAD CRIED THE VOICE RATHER A HARSH VOICE
1743-142912-0024 IT WAS CRESTY THE GREAT CRESTED FLYCATCHER HE WAS A WEE BIT BIGGER THAN SCRAPPER THE KINGBIRD YET NOT QUITE SO BIG AS WELCOME ROBIN AND MORE SLENDER
1743-142912-0025 HIS THROAT AND BREAST WERE GRAY SHADING INTO BRIGHT YELLOW UNDERNEATH HIS BACK AND HEAD WERE OF A GRAYISH BROWN WITH A TINT OF OLIVE GREEN A POINTED CAP WAS ALL THAT WAS NEEDED TO MAKE HIM QUITE DISTINGUISHED LOOKING
1743-142912-0026 YOU SEEM TO BE IN A HURRY SO DON'T LET ME DETAIN YOU PETER SAID CRESTY BEFORE PETER COULD FIND HIS TONGUE I JUST WANT TO ASK ONE LITTLE FAVOR OF YOU WHAT IS IT ASKED PETER WHO
1743-142912-0027 IF IN YOUR ROAMING ABOUT YOU RUN ACROSS AN OLD CAST OFF SUIT OF MISTER BLACK SNAKE OR OF ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE SNAKE FAMILY I WISH YOU WOULD REMEMBER ME AND LET ME KNOW WILL YOU PETER SAID CRESTY A A
1743-142912-0028 A WHAT STAMMERED PETER A CAST OFF SUIT OF CLOTHES FROM ANY MEMBER OF THE SNAKE FAMILY REPLIED CRESTY SOMEWHAT IMPATIENTLY NOW DON'T FORGET PETER I'VE GOT TO GO HOUSE HUNTING BUT YOU'LL FIND ME THERE OR HEREABOUTS IF IT HAPPENS THAT YOU FIND ONE OF THOSE
1743-142912-0029 CAST OFF SNAKE SUITS BEFORE PETER COULD SAY ANOTHER WORD CRESTY HAD FLOWN AWAY PETER HESITATED LOOKING FIRST TOWARDS THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH AND THEN TOWARDS JENNY WREN'S HOUSE
1743-142912-0030 HE JUST COULDN'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT THOSE CAST OFF SUITS OF THE SNAKE FAMILY AND HE FELT SURE THAT JENNY WREN COULD TELL HIM FINALLY CURIOSITY GOT THE BEST OF HIM AND BACK HE SCAMPERED LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP TO THE FOOT OF THE TREE IN WHICH JENNY WREN HAD HER HOME
1743-142912-0031 JENNY CALLED PETER JENNY WREN JENNY WREN NO ONE ANSWERED HIM HE COULD HEAR MISTER WREN SINGING IN ANOTHER TREE BUT HE COULDN'T SEE HIM JENNY JENNY WREN JENNY WREN CALLED PETER AGAIN
1743-142912-0032 THIS TIME JENNY POPPED HER HEAD OUT AND HER LITTLE EYES FAIRLY SNAPPED DIDN'T I TELL YOU THE OTHER DAY PETER RABBIT THAT I'M NOT TO BE DISTURBED DIDN'T I TELL YOU THAT I'VE GOT SEVEN EGGS IN HERE AND THAT I CAN'T SPEND ANY TIME GOSSIPING
1743-142912-0033 DIDN'T I PETER RABBIT DIDN'T I DIDN'T I YOU CERTAINLY DID JENNY YOU CERTAINLY DID AND I'M SORRY TO DISTURB YOU REPLIED PETER MEEKLY I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT OF DOING SUCH A THING BUT I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHO ELSE TO GO TO
1743-142912-0034 GO TO FOR WHAT SNAPPED JENNY WREN WHAT IS IT YOU'VE COME TO ME FOR SNAKE SKINS REPLIED PETER SNAKE SKINS SNAKE SKINS SHRIEKED JENNY WREN
1743-142912-0035 YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND CRIED PETER HURRIEDLY WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHY SHOULD CRESTY THE FLYCATCHER ASK ME TO PLEASE LET HIM KNOW IF I FOUND ANY CAST OFF SUITS OF THE SNAKE FAMILY
1743-142912-0036 HE FLEW AWAY BEFORE I COULD ASK HIM WHY HE WANTS THEM AND SO I CAME TO YOU BECAUSE I KNOW YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ESPECIALLY EVERYTHING CONCERNING YOUR NEIGHBORS
1743-142913-0000 WITH THIS JENNY WREN DISAPPEARED INSIDE HER HOUSE AND THERE WAS NOTHING FOR PETER TO DO BUT ONCE MORE START FOR THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH ON HIS WAY HE COULDN'T RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO RUN OVER TO THE GREEN FOREST WHICH WAS JUST BEYOND THE OLD ORCHARD
1743-142913-0001 HE JUST HAD TO FIND OUT IF THERE WAS ANYTHING NEW OVER THERE HARDLY HAD HE REACHED IT WHEN HE HEARD A PLAINTIVE VOICE CRYING PEE WEE PEE WEE PEE WEE PETER CHUCKLED HAPPILY
1743-142913-0002 HE USUALLY IS ONE OF THE LAST OF THE FLYCATCHER FAMILY TO ARRIVE I DIDN'T EXPECT TO FIND HIM YET I WONDER WHAT HAS BROUGHT HIM UP SO EARLY
1743-142913-0003 IT DIDN'T TAKE PETER LONG TO FIND PEWEE HE JUST FOLLOWED THE SOUND OF THAT VOICE AND PRESENTLY SAW PEWEE FLY OUT AND MAKE THE SAME KIND OF A LITTLE CIRCLE AS THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY MAKE WHEN THEY ARE HUNTING FLIES
1743-142913-0004 IT ENDED JUST WHERE IT HAD STARTED ON A DEAD TWIG OF A TREE IN A SHADY RATHER LONELY PART OF THE GREEN FOREST ALMOST AT ONCE HE BEGAN TO CALL HIS NAME IN A RATHER SAD PLAINTIVE TONE PEE WEE PEE WEE PEE WEE
1743-142913-0005 BUT HE WASN'T SAD AS PETER WELL KNEW IT WAS HIS WAY OF EXPRESSING HOW HAPPY HE FELT HE WAS A LITTLE BIGGER THAN HIS COUSIN CHEBEC BUT LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE HIM THERE WAS A LITTLE NOTCH IN THE END OF HIS TAIL
1743-142913-0006 THE UPPER HALF OF HIS BILL WAS BLACK BUT THE LOWER HALF WAS LIGHT PETER COULD SEE ON EACH WING TWO WHITISH BARS AND HE NOTICED THAT PEWEE'S WINGS WERE LONGER THAN HIS TAIL WHICH WASN'T THE CASE WITH CHEBEC
1743-142913-0007 BUT NO ONE COULD EVER MISTAKE PEWEE FOR ANY OF HIS RELATIVES FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT HE KEEPS REPEATING HIS OWN NAME OVER AND OVER AREN'T YOU HERE EARLY ASKED PETER PEWEE NODDED
1743-142913-0008 THAT IS SOMETHING I DON'T OFTEN DO IF YOU PLEASE PETER INQUIRED POLITELY WHY DO FOLKS CALL YOU WOOD PEWEE PEWEE CHUCKLED HAPPILY
1743-142913-0009 IT IS SO QUIET AND RESTFUL THAT I LOVE IT MISSUS PEWEE AND I ARE VERY RETIRING WE DO NOT LIKE TOO MANY NEAR NEIGHBORS YOU WON'T MIND IF I COME TO SEE YOU ONCE IN A WHILE WILL YOU ASKED PETER AS HE PREPARED TO START ON AGAIN FOR THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH
1743-142913-0010 COME AS OFTEN AS YOU LIKE REPLIED PEWEE THE OFTENER THE BETTER BACK IN THE OLD BRIAR PATCH PETER THOUGHT OVER ALL HE HAD LEARNED ABOUT THE FLYCATCHER FAMILY AND AS HE RECALLED HOW THEY WERE FOREVER CATCHING ALL SORTS OF FLYING INSECTS IT SUDDENLY STRUCK HIM
1743-142913-0011 THAT THEY MUST BE VERY USEFUL LITTLE PEOPLE IN HELPING OLD MOTHER NATURE TAKE CARE OF HER TREES AND OTHER GROWING THINGS WHICH INSECTS SO DEARLY LOVE TO DESTROY
1743-142913-0012 BUT MOST OF ALL PETER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT QUEER REQUEST OF CRESTY'S AND A DOZEN TIMES THAT DAY HE FOUND HIMSELF PEEPING UNDER OLD LOGS IN THE HOPE OF FINDING A CAST OFF COAT OF MISTER BLACK SNAKE
1743-142913-0013 IT WAS SUCH A FUNNY THING FOR CRESTY TO ASK FOR THAT PETER'S CURIOSITY WOULD ALLOW HIM NO PEACE AND THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS UP IN THE OLD ORCHARD BEFORE JOLLY MISTER SUN HAD KICKED HIS BEDCLOTHES OFF
1743-142913-0014 JENNY WREN WAS AS GOOD AS HER WORD WHILE SHE FLITTED AND HOPPED ABOUT THIS WAY AND THAT WAY IN THAT FUSSY WAY OF HERS GETTING HER BREAKFAST SHE TALKED JENNY COULDN'T KEEP HER TONGUE STILL IF SHE WANTED TO DID YOU FIND ANY OLD CLOTHES OF THE SNAKE FAMILY SHE DEMANDED
1743-142913-0015 THEN AS PETER SHOOK HIS HEAD HER TONGUE RAN ON WITHOUT WAITING FOR HIM TO REPLY CRESTY AND HIS WIFE ALWAYS INSIST UPON HAVING A PIECE OF SNAKE SKIN IN THEIR NEST SAID SHE WHY THEY WANT IT GOODNESS KNOWS BUT
1743-142913-0016 PERHAPS THEY THINK IT WILL SCARE ROBBERS AWAY AS FOR ME I SHOULD HAVE A COLD CHILL EVERY TIME I GOT INTO MY NEST IF I HAD TO SIT ON ANYTHING LIKE THAT I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT CRESTY AND HIS WIFE ARE A HANDSOME COUPLE
1743-142913-0017 AND THEY CERTAINLY HAVE GOOD SENSE IN CHOOSING A HOUSE MORE SENSE THAN ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THEIR FAMILY TO MY WAY OF THINKING BUT SNAKE SKINS UGH BY THE WAY WHERE DOES CRESTY BUILD ASKED PETER
1743-142913-0018 IN A HOLE IN A TREE LIKE THE REST OF US SENSIBLE PEOPLE RETORTED JENNY WREN PROMPTLY PETER LOOKED QUITE AS SURPRISED AS HE FELT DOES CRESTY MAKE THE HOLE HE ASKED GOODNESS GRACIOUS NO EXCLAIMED JENNY WREN
1743-142913-0019 WHERE ARE YOUR EYES PETER DID YOU EVER SEE A FLYCATCHER WITH A BILL THAT LOOKED AS IF IT COULD CUT WOOD SHE DIDN'T WAIT FOR A REPLY BUT RATTLED ON IT IS A GOOD THING FOR A LOT OF US THAT THE WOODPECKER FAMILY ARE SO FOND OF NEW HOUSES LOOK
1743-142913-0020 THERE IS DOWNY THE WOODPECKER HARD AT WORK ON A NEW HOUSE THIS VERY MINUTE THAT'S GOOD I LIKE TO SEE THAT IT MEANS THAT NEXT YEAR THERE WILL BE ONE MORE HOUSE FOR SOME ONE HERE IN THE OLD ORCHARD FOR MYSELF I PREFER OLD HOUSES
1743-142913-0021 I'VE NOTICED THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MY NEIGHBORS WHO FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT IT THERE IS SOMETHING SETTLED ABOUT AN OLD HOUSE IT DOESN'T ATTRACT ATTENTION THE WAY A NEW ONE DOES SO LONG AS IT HAS GOT REASONABLY GOOD WALLS AND THE RAIN AND THE WIND CAN'T GET IN
1743-142913-0022 THE OLDER IT IS THE BETTER IT SUITS ME BUT THE WOODPECKERS SEEM TO LIKE NEW HOUSES BEST WHICH AS I SAID BEFORE IS A VERY GOOD THING FOR THE REST OF US
1743-142913-0023 WINSOME BLUEBIRD STUPID SNAPPED JENNY WREN PETER GRINNED AND LOOKED FOOLISH OF COURSE SAID HE I FORGOT ALL ABOUT WINSOME AND SKIMMER THE TREE SWALLOW ADDED JENNY THAT'S SO I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED HIM EXCLAIMED PETER
1743-142913-0024 I'VE NOTICED THAT HE IS VERY FOND OF THE SAME HOUSE YEAR AFTER YEAR IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE AGAIN JENNY WREN NODDED YANK YANK THE NUTHATCH USES AN OLD HOUSE I'M TOLD BUT HE USUALLY GOES UP NORTH FOR HIS NESTING SAID SHE
1743-142913-0025 TOMMY TIT THE CHICKADEE SOMETIMES USES AN OLD HOUSE THEN AGAIN HE AND MISSUS CHICKADEE GET FUSSY AND MAKE A HOUSE FOR THEMSELVES YELLOW WING THE FLICKER WHO REALLY IS A WOODPECKER OFTEN USES AN OLD HOUSE BUT QUITE OFTEN MAKES A NEW ONE
1743-142913-0026 THEN THERE ARE KILLY THE SPARROW HAWK AND SPOOKY THE SCREECH OWL PETER LOOKED SURPRISED I DIDN'T SUPPOSE THEY NESTED IN HOLES IN TREES HE EXCLAIMED THEY CERTAINLY DO MORE'S THE PITY SNAPPED JENNY
1743-142913-0027 IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR THE REST OF US IF THEY DIDN'T NEST AT ALL BUT THEY DO AND AN OLD HOUSE OF YELLOW WING THE FLICKER SUITS EITHER OF THEM KILLY ALWAYS USES ONE THAT IS HIGH UP AND COMES BACK TO IT YEAR AFTER YEAR
1743-142913-0028 SPOOKY ISN'T PARTICULAR SO LONG AS THE HOUSE IS BIG ENOUGH TO BE COMFORTABLE HE LIVES IN IT MORE OR LESS THE YEAR AROUND NOW I MUST GET BACK TO THOSE EGGS OF MINE I'VE TALKED QUITE ENOUGH FOR ONE MORNING OH JENNY CRIED PETER AS A SUDDEN THOUGHT STRUCK HIM
1743-142913-0029 JENNY PAUSED AND JERKED HER TAIL IMPATIENTLY WELL WHAT IS IT NOW SHE DEMANDED HAVE YOU GOT TWO HOMES ASKED PETER GOODNESS GRACIOUS NO EXCLAIMED JENNY
1743-142913-0030 ONE IS ALL I CAN TAKE CARE OF THEN WHY DEMANDED PETER TRIUMPHANTLY DOES MISTER WREN WORK ALL DAY CARRYING STICKS AND STRAWS INTO A HOLE IN ANOTHER TREE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HE HAS CARRIED ENOUGH IN THERE TO BUILD TWO OR THREE NESTS
1743-142914-0000 HE WASN'T READY TO GO BACK HOME TO THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH YET THERE SEEMED NOTHING ELSE TO DO FOR EVERYBODY IN THE OLD ORCHARD WAS TOO BUSY FOR IDLE GOSSIP PETER SCRATCHED A LONG EAR WITH A LONG HIND FOOT TRYING TO THINK OF SOME PLACE TO GO
1743-142914-0001 I'LL JUST RUN OVER AND PAY MY RESPECTS TO GRANDFATHER FROG AND TO REDWING THE BLACKBIRD REDWING WAS ONE OF THE FIRST BIRDS TO ARRIVE AND I'VE NEGLECTED HIM SHAMEFULLY WHEN PETER THINKS OF SOMETHING TO DO HE WASTES NO TIME
1743-142914-0002 OFF HE STARTED LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP FOR THE SMILING POOL HE KEPT CLOSE TO THE EDGE OF THE GREEN FOREST UNTIL HE REACHED THE PLACE WHERE THE LAUGHING BROOK COMES OUT OF THE GREEN FOREST ON ITS WAY TO THE SMILING POOL IN THE GREEN MEADOWS
1743-142914-0003 BUSHES AND YOUNG TREES GROW ALONG THE BANKS OF THE LAUGHING BROOK AT THIS POINT THE GROUND WAS SOFT IN PLACES QUITE MUDDY PETER DOESN'T MIND GETTING HIS FEET DAMP SO HE HOPPED ALONG CARELESSLY
1743-142914-0004 FROM RIGHT UNDER HIS VERY NOSE SOMETHING SHOT UP INTO THE AIR WITH A WHISTLING SOUND IT STARTLED PETER SO THAT HE STOPPED SHORT WITH HIS EYES POPPING OUT OF HIS HEAD
1743-142914-0005 HE HAD JUST A GLIMPSE OF A BROWN FORM DISAPPEARING OVER THE TOPS OF SOME TALL BUSHES THEN PETER CHUCKLED
1743-142914-0006 HE SCARED ME FOR A SECOND THEN YOU ARE EVEN SAID A VOICE CLOSE AT HAND YOU SCARED HIM I SAW YOU COMING BUT LONGBILL DIDN'T PETER TURNED QUICKLY THERE WAS MISSUS WOODCOCK PEEPING AT HIM FROM BEHIND A TUSSOCK OF GRASS
1743-142914-0007 I DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE HIM APOLOGIZED PETER I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO DO YOU THINK HE WAS REALLY VERY MUCH SCARED
1743-142914-0008 I RECOGNIZED YOU JUST AS I WAS DISAPPEARING OVER THE TOPS OF THE BUSHES SO I CAME RIGHT BACK I LEARNED WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG THAT WHEN STARTLED IT IS BEST TO FLY FIRST AND FIND OUT AFTERWARDS WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS REAL DANGER
1743-142914-0009 I AM GLAD IT IS NO ONE BUT YOU PETER FOR I WAS HAVING A SPLENDID MEAL HERE AND I SHOULD HAVE HATED TO LEAVE IT YOU'LL EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO ON EATING I HOPE WE CAN TALK BETWEEN BITES
1743-142914-0010 CERTAINLY I'LL EXCUSE YOU REPLIED PETER STARING AROUND VERY HARD TO SEE WHAT IT COULD BE LONGBILL WAS MAKING SUCH A GOOD MEAL OF BUT PETER COULDN'T SEE A THING THAT LOOKED GOOD TO EAT THERE WASN'T EVEN A BUG OR A WORM CRAWLING ON THE GROUND
1743-142914-0011 LONGBILL TOOK TWO OR THREE STEPS IN RATHER A STATELY FASHION PETER HAD TO HIDE A SMILE FOR LONGBILL HAD SUCH AN AIR OF IMPORTANCE YET AT THE SAME TIME WAS SUCH AN ODD LOOKING FELLOW
1743-142914-0012 HE WAS QUITE A LITTLE BIGGER THAN WELCOME ROBIN HIS TAIL WAS SHORT HIS LEGS WERE SHORT AND HIS NECK WAS SHORT BUT HIS BILL WAS LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE UP
1743-142914-0013 HIS BACK WAS A MIXTURE OF GRAY BROWN BLACK AND BUFF WHILE HIS BREAST AND UNDER PARTS WERE A BEAUTIFUL REDDISH BUFF IT WAS HIS HEAD THAT MADE HIM LOOK QUEER
1743-142914-0014 HIS EYES WERE VERY BIG AND THEY WERE SET SO FAR BACK THAT PETER WONDERED IF IT WASN'T EASIER FOR HIM TO LOOK BEHIND HIM THAN IN FRONT OF HIM SUDDENLY LONGBILL PLUNGED HIS BILL INTO THE GROUND HE PLUNGED IT IN FOR THE WHOLE LENGTH
1743-142914-0015 THEN HE PULLED IT OUT AND PETER CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE TAIL END OF A WORM DISAPPEARING DOWN LONGBILL'S THROAT WHERE THAT LONG BILL HAD GONE INTO THE GROUND WAS A NEAT LITTLE ROUND HOLE
1743-142914-0016 FOR THE FIRST TIME PETER NOTICED THAT THERE WERE MANY SUCH LITTLE ROUND HOLES ALL ABOUT DID YOU MAKE ALL THOSE LITTLE ROUND HOLES EXCLAIMED PETER
1743-142914-0017 AND WAS THERE A WORM IN EVERY ONE ASKED PETER HIS EYES VERY WIDE WITH INTEREST LONGBILL NODDED
1743-142914-0018 PETER REMEMBERED HOW HE HAD WATCHED WELCOME ROBIN LISTEN AND THEN SUDDENLY PLUNGE HIS BILL INTO THE GROUND AND PULL OUT A WORM BUT THE WORMS WELCOME ROBIN GOT WERE ALWAYS CLOSE TO THE SURFACE
1743-142914-0019 WHILE THESE WORMS WERE SO DEEP IN THE EARTH THAT PETER COULDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR ANY ONE TO KNOW THAT THEY WERE THERE
1743-142914-0020 AND HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO OPEN YOUR BILL DOWN THERE TO TAKE HIM IN ASKED PETER LONGBILL CHUCKLED
1743-142914-0021 LONGBILL SUDDENLY THRUST HIS BILL STRAIGHT OUT IN FRONT OF HIM AND TO PETER'S ASTONISHMENT HE LIFTED THE END OF THE UPPER HALF WITHOUT OPENING THE REST OF HIS BILL AT ALL THAT'S THE WAY I GET THEM SAID HE
1743-142914-0022 I THINK THERE IS ONE RIGHT UNDER MY FEET NOW WATCH ME GET HIM LONGBILL BORED INTO THE GROUND UNTIL HIS HEAD WAS ALMOST AGAINST IT WHEN HE PULLED HIS BILL OUT SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS A WORM OF COURSE EXPLAINED LONGBILL IT IS ONLY IN SOFT GROUND THAT I CAN DO THIS
1743-142914-0023 THAT IS WHY I HAVE TO FLY AWAY SOUTH AS SOON AS THE GROUND FREEZES AT ALL IT'S WONDERFUL SIGHED PETER I DON'T SUPPOSE ANY ONE ELSE CAN FIND HIDDEN WORMS THAT WAY MY COUSIN JACK SNIPE CAN REPLIED LONGBILL PROMPTLY
1743-142914-0024 HE FEEDS THE SAME WAY I DO ONLY HE LIKES MARSHY MEADOWS INSTEAD OF BRUSHY SWAMPS PERHAPS YOU KNOW HIM PETER NODDED I DO SAID HE NOW YOU SPEAK OF IT THERE IS A STRONG FAMILY RESEMBLANCE ALTHOUGH I HADN'T THOUGHT OF HIM AS A RELATIVE OF YOURS BEFORE
1743-142914-0025 NOW I MUST BE RUNNING ALONG I'M EVER SO GLAD TO HAVE SEEN YOU AND I'M COMING OVER TO CALL AGAIN THE FIRST CHANCE I GET SO PETER SAID GOOD BY AND KEPT ON DOWN THE LAUGHING BROOK TO THE SMILING POOL RIGHT WHERE THE LAUGHING BROOK ENTERED THE SMILING POOL
1743-142914-0026 THERE WAS A LITTLE PEBBLY BEACH RUNNING ALONG THE VERY EDGE OF THE WATER WAS A SLIM TRIM LITTLE BIRD WITH FAIRLY LONG LEGS A LONG SLENDER BILL BROWNISH GRAY BACK WITH BLACK SPOTS AND MARKINGS AND A WHITE WAISTCOAT NEATLY SPOTTED WITH BLACK
1743-142914-0027 EVERY FEW STEPS HE WOULD STOP TO PICK UP SOMETHING THEN STAND FOR A SECOND BOBBING UP AND DOWN IN THE FUNNIEST WAY AS IF HIS BODY WAS SO NICELY BALANCED ON HIS LEGS THAT IT TEETERED BACK AND FORTH LIKE A SEESAW
1743-142914-0028 IT WAS TEETER THE SPOTTED SANDPIPER AN OLD FRIEND OF PETER'S PETER GREETED HIM JOYOUSLY
1743-142914-0029 BEFORE PETER COULD SAY ANOTHER WORD TEETER CAME RUNNING TOWARDS HIM AND IT WAS PLAIN TO SEE THAT TEETER WAS VERY ANXIOUS ABOUT SOMETHING DON'T MOVE PETER RABBIT DON'T MOVE HE CRIED WHY NOT DEMANDED PETER FOR HE COULD SEE NO DANGER AND COULD THINK OF NO REASON WHY HE SHOULDN'T MOVE
1743-142914-0030 JUST THEN MISSUS TEETER CAME HURRYING UP AND SQUATTED DOWN IN THE SAND RIGHT IN FRONT OF PETER THANK GOODNESS EXCLAIMED TEETER STILL BOBBING AND BOWING IF YOU HAD TAKEN ANOTHER STEP PETER RABBIT YOU WOULD HAVE STEPPED RIGHT ON OUR EGGS YOU GAVE ME A DREADFUL START
1743-142914-0031 MISSUS TEETER STOOD UP AND STEPPED ASIDE THEN PETER SAW RIGHT IN A LITTLE HOLLOW IN THE SAND WITH JUST A FEW BITS OF GRASS FOR A LINING FOUR WHITE EGGS WITH BIG DARK BLOTCHES ON THEM
1743-142914-0032 THEY LOOKED SO MUCH LIKE THE SURROUNDING PEBBLES THAT HE NEVER WOULD HAVE SEEN THEM IN THE WORLD BUT FOR MISSUS TEETER PETER HASTILY BACKED AWAY A FEW STEPS MISSUS TEETER SLIPPED BACK ON THE EGGS AND SETTLED HERSELF COMFORTABLY
1743-142914-0033 IT SUDDENLY STRUCK PETER THAT IF HE HADN'T SEEN HER DO IT HE WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN SHE WAS THERE
1743-142914-0034 MY HE EXCLAIMED I CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE STEPPED ON THOSE EGGS IF YOU HADN'T WARNED ME SAID HE I'M SO THANKFUL I DIDN'T I DON'T SEE HOW YOU DARE LAY THEM IN THE OPEN LIKE THIS
19-198-0000 NORTHANGER ABBEY
19-198-0001 THIS LITTLE WORK WAS FINISHED IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN O THREE AND INTENDED FOR IMMEDIATE PUBLICATION IT WAS DISPOSED OF TO A BOOKSELLER IT WAS EVEN ADVERTISED
19-198-0002 NEITHER THE AUTHOR NOR THE PUBLIC HAVE ANY OTHER CONCERN THAN AS SOME OBSERVATION IS NECESSARY UPON THOSE PARTS OF THE WORK WHICH THIRTEEN YEARS HAVE MADE COMPARATIVELY OBSOLETE
19-198-0003 THE PUBLIC ARE ENTREATED TO BEAR IN MIND THAT THIRTEEN YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE IT WAS FINISHED MANY MORE SINCE IT WAS BEGUN AND THAT DURING THAT PERIOD PLACES MANNERS BOOKS AND OPINIONS HAVE UNDERGONE CONSIDERABLE CHANGES
19-198-0004 CHAPTER ONE NO ONE WHO HAD EVER SEEN CATHERINE MORLAND IN HER INFANCY WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED HER BORN TO BE AN HEROINE HER SITUATION IN LIFE
19-198-0005 THE CHARACTER OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER HER OWN PERSON AND DISPOSITION WERE ALL EQUALLY AGAINST HER HER FATHER WAS A CLERGYMAN WITHOUT BEING NEGLECTED OR POOR AND A VERY RESPECTABLE MAN
19-198-0006 HER MOTHER WAS A WOMAN OF USEFUL PLAIN SENSE WITH A GOOD TEMPER AND WHAT IS MORE REMARKABLE WITH A GOOD CONSTITUTION SHE HAD THREE SONS BEFORE CATHERINE WAS BORN
19-198-0007 WHERE THERE ARE HEADS AND ARMS AND LEGS ENOUGH FOR THE NUMBER BUT THE MORLANDS HAD LITTLE OTHER RIGHT TO THE WORD FOR THEY WERE IN GENERAL VERY PLAIN AND CATHERINE FOR MANY YEARS OF HER LIFE AS PLAIN AS ANY
19-198-0008 SHE HAD A THIN AWKWARD FIGURE
19-198-0009 DARK LANK HAIR AND STRONG FEATURES SO MUCH FOR HER PERSON AND NOT LESS UNPROPITIOUS FOR HEROISM SEEMED HER MIND SHE WAS FOND OF ALL BOY'S PLAYS AND GREATLY PREFERRED CRICKET
19-198-0010 NOT MERELY TO DOLLS BUT TO THE MORE HEROIC ENJOYMENTS OF INFANCY NURSING A DORMOUSE FEEDING A CANARY BIRD OR WATERING A ROSE BUSH INDEED SHE HAD NO TASTE FOR A GARDEN
19-198-0011 AND IF SHE GATHERED FLOWERS AT ALL IT WAS CHIEFLY FOR THE PLEASURE OF MISCHIEF AT LEAST SO IT WAS CONJECTURED FROM HER ALWAYS PREFERRING THOSE WHICH SHE WAS FORBIDDEN TO TAKE SUCH WERE HER PROPENSITIES
19-198-0012 HER ABILITIES WERE QUITE AS EXTRAORDINARY SHE NEVER COULD LEARN OR UNDERSTAND ANYTHING BEFORE SHE WAS TAUGHT AND SOMETIMES NOT EVEN THEN FOR SHE WAS OFTEN INATTENTIVE AND OCCASIONALLY STUPID
19-198-0013 HER MOTHER WAS THREE MONTHS IN TEACHING HER ONLY TO REPEAT THE BEGGAR'S PETITION AND AFTER ALL HER NEXT SISTER SALLY COULD SAY IT BETTER THAN SHE DID NOT THAT CATHERINE WAS ALWAYS STUPID BY NO MEANS
19-198-0014 SHE LEARNT THE FABLE OF THE HARE AND MANY FRIENDS AS QUICKLY AS ANY GIRL IN ENGLAND HER MOTHER WISHED HER TO LEARN MUSIC AND CATHERINE WAS SURE SHE SHOULD LIKE IT FOR SHE WAS VERY FOND OF TINKLING THE KEYS OF THE OLD FORLORN SPINNET
19-198-0015 SO AT EIGHT YEARS OLD SHE BEGAN SHE LEARNT A YEAR AND COULD NOT BEAR IT AND MISSUS MORLAND WHO DID NOT INSIST ON HER DAUGHTERS BEING ACCOMPLISHED IN SPITE OF INCAPACITY OR DISTASTE ALLOWED HER TO LEAVE OFF
19-198-0016 FRENCH BY HER MOTHER HER PROFICIENCY IN EITHER WAS NOT REMARKABLE AND SHE SHIRKED HER LESSONS IN BOTH WHENEVER SHE COULD WHAT A STRANGE UNACCOUNTABLE CHARACTER FOR WITH ALL THESE SYMPTOMS OF PROFLIGACY AT TEN YEARS OLD
19-198-0017 HATED CONFINEMENT AND CLEANLINESS AND LOVED NOTHING SO WELL IN THE WORLD AS ROLLING DOWN THE GREEN SLOPE AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE SUCH WAS CATHERINE MORLAND AT TEN AT FIFTEEN APPEARANCES WERE MENDING
19-198-0018 SHE BEGAN TO CURL HER HAIR AND LONG FOR BALLS HER COMPLEXION IMPROVED HER FEATURES WERE SOFTENED BY PLUMPNESS AND COLOUR HER EYES GAINED MORE ANIMATION AND HER FIGURE MORE CONSEQUENCE
19-198-0019 HER LOVE OF DIRT GAVE WAY TO AN INCLINATION FOR FINERY AND SHE GREW CLEAN AS SHE GREW SMART SHE HAD NOW THE PLEASURE OF SOMETIMES HEARING HER FATHER AND MOTHER REMARK ON HER PERSONAL IMPROVEMENT
19-198-0020 CATHERINE GROWS QUITE A GOOD LOOKING GIRL SHE IS ALMOST PRETTY TODAY WERE WORDS WHICH CAUGHT HER EARS NOW AND THEN AND HOW WELCOME WERE THE SOUNDS TO LOOK ALMOST PRETTY
19-198-0021 THAN A BEAUTY FROM HER CRADLE CAN EVER RECEIVE MISSUS MORLAND WAS A VERY GOOD WOMAN AND WISHED TO SEE HER CHILDREN EVERYTHING THEY OUGHT TO BE BUT HER TIME WAS SO MUCH OCCUPIED IN LYING IN AND TEACHING THE LITTLE ONES
19-198-0022 THAT HER ELDER DAUGHTERS WERE INEVITABLY LEFT TO SHIFT FOR THEMSELVES AND IT WAS NOT VERY WONDERFUL THAT CATHERINE WHO HAD BY NATURE NOTHING HEROIC ABOUT HER SHOULD PREFER CRICKET BASEBALL RIDING ON HORSEBACK
19-198-0023 AND RUNNING ABOUT THE COUNTRY AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN TO BOOKS OR AT LEAST BOOKS OF INFORMATION FOR PROVIDED THAT NOTHING LIKE USEFUL KNOWLEDGE COULD BE GAINED FROM THEM PROVIDED THEY WERE ALL STORY AND NO REFLECTION
19-198-0024 SHE HAD NEVER ANY OBJECTION TO BOOKS AT ALL BUT FROM FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN SHE WAS IN TRAINING FOR A HEROINE SHE READ ALL SUCH WORKS AS HEROINES MUST READ TO SUPPLY THEIR MEMORIES WITH THOSE QUOTATIONS WHICH ARE SO SERVICEABLE
19-198-0025 MANY A FLOWER IS BORN TO BLUSH UNSEEN AND WASTE ITS FRAGRANCE ON THE DESERT AIR FROM THOMPSON THAT IT IS A DELIGHTFUL TASK TO TEACH THE YOUNG IDEA HOW TO SHOOT
19-198-0026 AND FROM SHAKESPEARE SHE GAINED A GREAT STORE OF INFORMATION AMONGST THE REST THAT TRIFLES LIGHT AS AIR ARE TO THE JEALOUS CONFIRMATION STRONG AS PROOFS OF HOLY WRIT
19-198-0027 THAT THE POOR BEETLE WHICH WE TREAD UPON IN CORPORAL SUFFERANCE FEELS A PANG AS GREAT AS WHEN A GIANT DIES AND THAT A YOUNG WOMAN IN LOVE ALWAYS LOOKS
19-198-0028 LIKE PATIENCE ON A MONUMENT SMILING AT GRIEF SO FAR HER IMPROVEMENT WAS SUFFICIENT AND IN MANY OTHER POINTS SHE CAME ON EXCEEDINGLY WELL FOR THOUGH SHE COULD NOT WRITE SONNETS
19-198-0029 SHE BROUGHT HERSELF TO READ THEM AND THOUGH THERE SEEMED NO CHANCE OF HER THROWING A WHOLE PARTY INTO RAPTURES BY A PRELUDE ON THE PIANOFORTE OF HER OWN COMPOSITION SHE COULD LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE'S PERFORMANCE WITH VERY LITTLE FATIGUE
19-198-0030 HER GREATEST DEFICIENCY WAS IN THE PENCIL SHE HAD NO NOTION OF DRAWING NOT ENOUGH EVEN TO ATTEMPT A SKETCH OF HER LOVER'S PROFILE THAT SHE MIGHT BE DETECTED IN THE DESIGN
19-198-0031 THERE SHE FELL MISERABLY SHORT OF THE TRUE HEROIC HEIGHT AT PRESENT SHE DID NOT KNOW HER OWN POVERTY FOR SHE HAD NO LOVER TO PORTRAY SHE HAD REACHED THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN
19-198-0032 WITHOUT HAVING SEEN ONE AMIABLE YOUTH WHO COULD CALL FORTH HER SENSIBILITY WITHOUT HAVING INSPIRED ONE REAL PASSION AND WITHOUT HAVING EXCITED EVEN ANY ADMIRATION BUT WHAT WAS VERY MODERATE AND VERY TRANSIENT
19-198-0033 THIS WAS STRANGE INDEED BUT STRANGE THINGS MAY BE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR IF THEIR CAUSE BE FAIRLY SEARCHED OUT THERE WAS NOT ONE LORD IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD NO NOT EVEN A BARONET
19-198-0034 THERE WAS NOT ONE FAMILY AMONG THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD REARED AND SUPPORTED A BOY ACCIDENTALLY FOUND AT THEIR DOOR NOT ONE YOUNG MAN WHOSE ORIGIN WAS UNKNOWN HER FATHER HAD NO WARD AND THE SQUIRE OF THE PARISH NO CHILDREN
19-198-0035 BUT WHEN A YOUNG LADY IS TO BE A HEROINE THE PERVERSENESS OF FORTY SURROUNDING FAMILIES CANNOT PREVENT HER SOMETHING MUST AND WILL HAPPEN TO THROW A HERO IN HER WAY MISTER ALLEN
19-198-0036 WHO OWNED THE CHIEF OF THE PROPERTY ABOUT FULLERTON THE VILLAGE IN WILTSHIRE WHERE THE MORLANDS LIVED WAS ORDERED TO BATH FOR THE BENEFIT OF A GOUTY CONSTITUTION AND HIS LADY A GOOD HUMOURED WOMAN FOND OF MISS MORLAND AND PROBABLY AWARE THAT IF
19-198-0037 SHE MUST SEEK THEM ABROAD INVITED HER TO GO WITH THEM
19-227-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY CATHERINE'S DISPOSITION WAS NOT NATURALLY SEDENTARY NOR HAD HER HABITS BEEN EVER VERY INDUSTRIOUS BUT WHATEVER MIGHT HITHERTO HAVE BEEN HER DEFECTS OF THAT SORT
19-227-0001 HER MOTHER COULD NOT BUT PERCEIVE THEM NOW TO BE GREATLY INCREASED SHE COULD NEITHER SIT STILL NOR EMPLOY HERSELF FOR TEN MINUTES TOGETHER WALKING ROUND THE GARDEN AND ORCHARD AGAIN AND AGAIN AS IF NOTHING BUT MOTION WAS VOLUNTARY
19-227-0002 AND IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD EVEN WALK ABOUT THE HOUSE RATHER THAN REMAIN FIXED FOR ANY TIME IN THE PARLOUR HER LOSS OF SPIRITS WAS A YET GREATER ALTERATION IN HER RAMBLING AND HER IDLENESS
19-227-0003 BUT WHEN A THIRD NIGHT'S REST HAD NEITHER RESTORED HER CHEERFULNESS IMPROVED HER IN USEFUL ACTIVITY NOR GIVEN HER A GREATER INCLINATION FOR NEEDLEWORK SHE COULD NO LONGER REFRAIN FROM THE GENTLE REPROOF OF
19-227-0004 MY DEAR CATHERINE I AM AFRAID YOU ARE GROWING QUITE A FINE LADY I DO NOT KNOW WHEN POOR RICHARD'S CRAVATS WOULD BE DONE IF HE HAD NO FRIEND BUT YOU YOUR HEAD RUNS TOO MUCH UPON BATH
19-227-0005 CATHERINE TOOK UP HER WORK DIRECTLY SAYING IN A DEJECTED VOICE THAT HER HEAD DID NOT RUN UPON BATH MUCH THEN YOU ARE FRETTING ABOUT GENERAL TILNEY AND THAT IS VERY SIMPLE OF YOU
19-227-0006 FOR TEN TO ONE WHETHER YOU EVER SEE HIM AGAIN YOU SHOULD NEVER FRET ABOUT TRIFLES AFTER A SHORT SILENCE I HOPE MY CATHERINE YOU ARE NOT GETTING OUT OF HUMOUR WITH HOME BECAUSE IT IS NOT SO GRAND AS NORTHANGER
19-227-0007 THAT WOULD BE TURNING YOUR VISIT INTO AN EVIL INDEED WHEREVER YOU ARE YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE CONTENTED BUT ESPECIALLY AT HOME BECAUSE THERE YOU MUST SPEND THE MOST OF YOUR TIME I DID NOT QUITE LIKE AT BREAKFAST
19-227-0008 TO HEAR YOU TALK SO MUCH ABOUT THE FRENCH BREAD AT NORTHANGER I AM SURE I DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE BREAD IT IS ALL THE SAME TO ME WHAT I EAT THERE IS A VERY CLEVER ESSAY IN ONE OF THE BOOKS UPSTAIRS UPON MUCH SUCH A SUBJECT
19-227-0009 ABOUT YOUNG GIRLS THAT HAVE BEEN SPOILT FOR HOME BY GREAT ACQUAINTANCE THE MIRROR I THINK I WILL LOOK IT OUT FOR YOU SOME DAY OR OTHER BECAUSE I AM SURE IT WILL DO YOU GOOD CATHERINE SAID NO MORE AND WITH AN ENDEAVOUR TO DO RIGHT
19-227-0010 APPLIED TO HER WORK BUT AFTER A FEW MINUTES SUNK AGAIN WITHOUT KNOWING IT HERSELF INTO LANGUOR AND LISTLESSNESS MOVING HERSELF IN HER CHAIR FROM THE IRRITATION OF WEARINESS MUCH OFTENER THAN SHE MOVED HER NEEDLE
19-227-0011 HASTILY LEFT THE ROOM TO FETCH THE BOOK IN QUESTION ANXIOUS TO LOSE NO TIME IN ATTACKING SO DREADFUL A MALADY IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE SHE COULD FIND WHAT SHE LOOKED FOR AND OTHER FAMILY MATTERS OCCURRING TO DETAIN HER
19-227-0012 A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HAD ELAPSED ERE SHE RETURNED DOWNSTAIRS WITH THE VOLUME FROM WHICH SO MUCH WAS HOPED HER AVOCATIONS ABOVE HAVING SHUT OUT ALL NOISE BUT WHAT SHE CREATED HERSELF
19-227-0013 SHE KNEW NOT THAT A VISITOR HAD ARRIVED WITHIN THE LAST FEW MINUTES TILL ON ENTERING THE ROOM THE FIRST OBJECT SHE BEHELD WAS A YOUNG MAN WHOM SHE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
19-227-0014 WITH A LOOK OF MUCH RESPECT HE IMMEDIATELY ROSE AND BEING INTRODUCED TO HER BY HER CONSCIOUS DAUGHTER AS MISTER HENRY TILNEY WITH THE EMBARRASSMENT OF REAL SENSIBILITY
19-227-0015 BEGAN TO APOLOGIZE FOR HIS APPEARANCE THERE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED HE HAD LITTLE RIGHT TO EXPECT A WELCOME AT FULLERTON AND STATING HIS IMPATIENCE TO BE ASSURED OF MISS MORLAND'S HAVING REACHED HER HOME IN SAFETY
19-227-0016 AS THE CAUSE OF HIS INTRUSION HE DID NOT ADDRESS HIMSELF TO AN UNCANDID JUDGE OR A RESENTFUL HEART FAR FROM COMPREHENDING HIM OR HIS SISTER IN THEIR FATHER'S MISCONDUCT
19-227-0017 MISSUS MORLAND HAD BEEN ALWAYS KINDLY DISPOSED TOWARDS EACH AND INSTANTLY PLEASED BY HIS APPEARANCE RECEIVED HIM WITH THE SIMPLE PROFESSIONS OF UNAFFECTED BENEVOLENCE THANKING HIM FOR SUCH AN ATTENTION TO HER DAUGHTER
19-227-0018 THOUGH HIS HEART WAS GREATLY RELIEVED BY SUCH UNLOOKED FOR MILDNESS IT WAS NOT JUST AT THAT MOMENT IN HIS POWER TO SAY ANYTHING TO THE PURPOSE RETURNING IN SILENCE TO HIS SEAT THEREFORE
19-227-0019 BUT HER GLOWING CHEEK AND BRIGHTENED EYE MADE HER MOTHER TRUST THAT THIS GOOD NATURED VISIT WOULD AT LEAST SET HER HEART AT EASE FOR A TIME AND GLADLY THEREFORE DID SHE LAY ASIDE THE FIRST VOLUME OF THE MIRROR FOR A FUTURE HOUR
19-227-0020 DESIROUS OF MISTER MORLAND'S ASSISTANCE AS WELL IN GIVING ENCOURAGEMENT AS IN FINDING CONVERSATION FOR HER GUEST WHOSE EMBARRASSMENT ON HIS FATHER'S ACCOUNT SHE EARNESTLY PITIED
19-227-0021 MISSUS MORLAND HAD VERY EARLY DISPATCHED ONE OF THE CHILDREN TO SUMMON HIM BUT MISTER MORLAND WAS FROM HOME AND BEING THUS WITHOUT ANY SUPPORT AT THE END OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY
19-227-0022 AFTER A COUPLE OF MINUTES UNBROKEN SILENCE HENRY TURNING TO CATHERINE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HER MOTHER'S ENTRANCE ASKED HER WITH SUDDEN ALACRITY IF MISTER AND MISSUS ALLEN WERE NOW AT FULLERTON
19-227-0023 AND ON DEVELOPING FROM AMIDST ALL HER PERPLEXITY OF WORDS IN REPLY THE MEANING WHICH ONE SHORT SYLLABLE WOULD HAVE GIVEN IMMEDIATELY EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF PAYING HIS RESPECTS TO THEM AND
19-227-0024 ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SHOW HIM THE WAY YOU MAY SEE THE HOUSE FROM THIS WINDOW SIR WAS INFORMATION ON SARAH'S SIDE WHICH PRODUCED ONLY A BOW OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT FROM THE GENTLEMAN AND A SILENCING NOD FROM HER MOTHER
19-227-0025 FOR MISSUS MORLAND THINKING IT PROBABLE AS A SECONDARY CONSIDERATION IN HIS WISH OF WAITING ON THEIR WORTHY NEIGHBOURS THAT HE MIGHT HAVE SOME EXPLANATION TO GIVE OF HIS FATHER'S BEHAVIOUR
19-227-0026 WHICH IT MUST BE MORE PLEASANT FOR HIM TO COMMUNICATE ONLY TO CATHERINE WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT PREVENT HER ACCOMPANYING HIM THEY BEGAN THEIR WALK AND MISSUS MORLAND WAS NOT ENTIRELY MISTAKEN IN HIS OBJECT IN WISHING IT
19-227-0027 SOME EXPLANATION ON HIS FATHER'S ACCOUNT HE HAD TO GIVE BUT HIS FIRST PURPOSE WAS TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF AND BEFORE THEY REACHED MISTER ALLEN'S GROUNDS HE HAD DONE IT SO WELL THAT CATHERINE DID NOT THINK IT COULD EVER BE REPEATED TOO OFTEN
19-227-0028 AND DELIGHTED IN ALL THE EXCELLENCIES OF HER CHARACTER AND TRULY LOVED HER SOCIETY I MUST CONFESS THAT HIS AFFECTION ORIGINATED IN NOTHING BETTER THAN GRATITUDE OR IN OTHER WORDS THAT A PERSUASION OF HER PARTIALITY FOR HIM
19-227-0029 HAD BEEN THE ONLY CAUSE OF GIVING HER A SERIOUS THOUGHT IT IS A NEW CIRCUMSTANCE IN ROMANCE I ACKNOWLEDGE AND DREADFULLY DEROGATORY OF AN HEROINE'S DIGNITY BUT IF IT BE AS NEW IN COMMON LIFE
19-227-0030 THE CREDIT OF A WILD IMAGINATION WILL AT LEAST BE ALL MY OWN A VERY SHORT VISIT TO MISSUS ALLEN IN WHICH HENRY TALKED AT RANDOM WITHOUT SENSE OR CONNECTION AND CATHERINE
19-227-0031 SCARCELY OPENED HER LIPS DISMISSED THEM TO THE ECSTASIES OF ANOTHER TETE A TETE AND BEFORE IT WAS SUFFERED TO CLOSE SHE WAS ENABLED TO JUDGE HOW FAR HE WAS SANCTIONED BY PARENTAL AUTHORITY IN HIS PRESENT APPLICATION
19-227-0032 ON HIS RETURN FROM WOODSTON TWO DAYS BEFORE HE HAD BEEN MET NEAR THE ABBEY BY HIS IMPATIENT FATHER HASTILY INFORMED IN ANGRY TERMS OF MISS MORLAND'S DEPARTURE AND ORDERED TO THINK OF HER NO MORE
19-227-0033 SUCH WAS THE PERMISSION UPON WHICH HE HAD NOW OFFERED HER HIS HAND THE AFFRIGHTED CATHERINE AMIDST ALL THE TERRORS OF EXPECTATION AS SHE LISTENED TO THIS ACCOUNT
19-227-0034 COULD NOT BUT REJOICE IN THE KIND CAUTION WITH WHICH HENRY HAD SAVED HER FROM THE NECESSITY OF A CONSCIENTIOUS REJECTION BY ENGAGING HER FAITH BEFORE HE MENTIONED THE SUBJECT
19-227-0035 NOTHING TO LAY TO HER CHARGE BUT HER BEING THE INVOLUNTARY UNCONSCIOUS OBJECT OF A DECEPTION WHICH HIS PRIDE COULD NOT PARDON AND WHICH A BETTER PRIDE WOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO OWN
19-227-0036 AND DESIGNED HER FOR HIS DAUGHTER IN LAW ON DISCOVERING HIS ERROR TO TURN HER FROM THE HOUSE SEEMED THE BEST THOUGH TO HIS FEELINGS AN INADEQUATE PROOF OF HIS RESENTMENT TOWARDS HERSELF AND HIS CONTEMPT OF HER FAMILY
19-227-0037 JOHN THORPE HAD FIRST MISLED HIM THE GENERAL PERCEIVING HIS SON ONE NIGHT AT THE THEATRE TO BE PAYING CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION TO MISS MORLAND
19-227-0038 HAD ACCIDENTALLY INQUIRED OF THORPE IF HE KNEW MORE OF HER THAN HER NAME THORPE MOST HAPPY TO BE ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH A MAN OF GENERAL TILNEY'S IMPORTANCE HAD BEEN JOYFULLY AND PROUDLY COMMUNICATIVE
19-227-0039 AND BEING AT THAT TIME NOT ONLY IN DAILY EXPECTATION OF MORLAND'S ENGAGING ISABELLA BUT LIKEWISE PRETTY WELL RESOLVED UPON MARRYING CATHERINE HIMSELF
19-227-0040 HIS VANITY INDUCED HIM TO REPRESENT THE FAMILY AS YET MORE WEALTHY THAN HIS VANITY AND AVARICE HAD MADE HIM BELIEVE THEM WITH WHOMSOEVER HE WAS OR WAS LIKELY TO BE CONNECTED
19-227-0041 HIS OWN CONSEQUENCE ALWAYS REQUIRED THAT THEIRS SHOULD BE GREAT AND AS HIS INTIMACY WITH ANY ACQUAINTANCE GREW SO REGULARLY GREW THEIR FORTUNE THE EXPECTATIONS OF HIS FRIEND MORLAND THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST OVERRATED
19-227-0042 HAD EVER SINCE HIS INTRODUCTION TO ISABELLA BEEN GRADUALLY INCREASING AND BY MERELY ADDING TWICE AS MUCH FOR THE GRANDEUR OF THE MOMENT BY DOUBLING WHAT HE CHOSE TO THINK THE AMOUNT OF MISTER MORLAND'S PREFERMENT TREBLING HIS PRIVATE FORTUNE
19-227-0043 BESTOWING A RICH AUNT AND SINKING HALF THE CHILDREN HE WAS ABLE TO REPRESENT THE WHOLE FAMILY TO THE GENERAL IN A MOST RESPECTABLE LIGHT FOR CATHERINE HOWEVER THE PECULIAR OBJECT OF THE GENERAL'S CURIOSITY
19-227-0044 AND HIS OWN SPECULATIONS HE HAD YET SOMETHING MORE IN RESERVE AND THE TEN OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH HER FATHER COULD GIVE HER WOULD BE A PRETTY ADDITION TO MISTER ALLEN'S ESTATE
19-227-0045 HER INTIMACY THERE HAD MADE HIM SERIOUSLY DETERMINE ON HER BEING HANDSOMELY LEGACIED HEREAFTER AND TO SPEAK OF HER THEREFORE AS THE ALMOST ACKNOWLEDGED FUTURE HEIRESS OF FULLERTON NATURALLY FOLLOWED
19-227-0046 UPON SUCH INTELLIGENCE THE GENERAL HAD PROCEEDED FOR NEVER HAD IT OCCURRED TO HIM TO DOUBT ITS AUTHORITY THORPE'S INTEREST IN THE FAMILY BY HIS SISTER'S APPROACHING CONNECTION WITH ONE OF ITS MEMBERS
19-227-0047 AND HIS OWN VIEWS ON ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH HE BOASTED WITH ALMOST EQUAL OPENNESS SEEMED SUFFICIENT VOUCHERS FOR HIS TRUTH AND TO THESE WERE ADDED THE ABSOLUTE FACTS OF THE ALLENS BEING WEALTHY AND CHILDLESS
19-227-0048 OF MISS MORLAND'S BEING UNDER THEIR CARE AND AS SOON AS HIS ACQUAINTANCE ALLOWED HIM TO JUDGE OF THEIR TREATING HER WITH PARENTAL KINDNESS HIS RESOLUTION WAS SOON FORMED
19-227-0049 AND THANKFUL FOR MISTER THORPE'S COMMUNICATION HE ALMOST INSTANTLY DETERMINED TO SPARE NO PAINS IN WEAKENING HIS BOASTED INTEREST AND RUINING HIS DEAREST HOPES
19-227-0050 CATHERINE HERSELF COULD NOT BE MORE IGNORANT AT THE TIME OF ALL THIS THAN HIS OWN CHILDREN HENRY AND ELEANOR PERCEIVING NOTHING IN HER SITUATION LIKELY TO ENGAGE THEIR FATHER'S PARTICULAR RESPECT
19-227-0051 HAD SEEN WITH ASTONISHMENT THE SUDDENNESS CONTINUANCE AND EXTENT OF HIS ATTENTION AND THOUGH LATTERLY FROM SOME HINTS WHICH HAD ACCOMPANIED AN ALMOST POSITIVE COMMAND TO HIS SON OF DOING EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO ATTACH HER
19-227-0052 HENRY WAS CONVINCED OF HIS FATHER'S BELIEVING IT TO BE AN ADVANTAGEOUS CONNECTION IT WAS NOT TILL THE LATE EXPLANATION AT NORTHANGER THAT THEY HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA OF THE FALSE CALCULATIONS WHICH HAD HURRIED HIM ON
19-227-0053 THAT THEY WERE FALSE THE GENERAL HAD LEARNT FROM THE VERY PERSON WHO HAD SUGGESTED THEM FROM THORPE HIMSELF WHOM HE HAD CHANCED TO MEET AGAIN IN TOWN AND WHO UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EXACTLY OPPOSITE FEELINGS
19-227-0054 IRRITATED BY CATHERINE'S REFUSAL AND YET MORE BY THE FAILURE OF A VERY RECENT ENDEAVOUR TO ACCOMPLISH A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN MORLAND AND ISABELLA CONVINCED THAT THEY WERE SEPARATED FOREVER
19-227-0055 AND SPURNING A FRIENDSHIP WHICH COULD BE NO LONGER SERVICEABLE HASTENED TO CONTRADICT ALL THAT HE HAD SAID BEFORE TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE MORLANDS CONFESSED HIMSELF TO HAVE BEEN TOTALLY MISTAKEN IN HIS OPINION OF THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES AND CHARACTER
19-227-0056 MISLED BY THE RHODOMONTADE OF HIS FRIEND TO BELIEVE HIS FATHER A MAN OF SUBSTANCE AND CREDIT WHEREAS THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE TWO OR THREE LAST WEEKS PROVED HIM TO BE NEITHER
19-227-0057 FOR AFTER COMING EAGERLY FORWARD ON THE FIRST OVERTURE OF A MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE FAMILIES WITH THE MOST LIBERAL PROPOSALS HE HAD ON BEING BROUGHT TO THE POINT BY THE SHREWDNESS OF THE RELATOR
19-227-0058 BEEN CONSTRAINED TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIMSELF INCAPABLE OF GIVING THE YOUNG PEOPLE EVEN A DECENT SUPPORT THEY WERE IN FACT A NECESSITOUS FAMILY NUMEROUS TOO ALMOST BEYOND EXAMPLE BY NO MEANS RESPECTED IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD
19-227-0059 AS HE HAD LATELY HAD PARTICULAR OPPORTUNITIES OF DISCOVERING AIMING AT A STYLE OF LIFE WHICH THEIR FORTUNE COULD NOT WARRANT SEEKING TO BETTER THEMSELVES BY WEALTHY CONNECTIONS A FORWARD BRAGGING SCHEMING RACE
19-227-0060 THE TERRIFIED GENERAL PRONOUNCED THE NAME OF ALLEN WITH AN INQUIRING LOOK AND HERE TOO THORPE HAD LEARNT HIS ERROR THE ALLENS HE BELIEVED HAD LIVED NEAR THEM TOO LONG
19-227-0061 AND HE KNEW THE YOUNG MAN ON WHOM THE FULLERTON ESTATE MUST DEVOLVE THE GENERAL NEEDED NO MORE ENRAGED WITH ALMOST EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD BUT HIMSELF HE SET OUT THE NEXT DAY FOR THE ABBEY WHERE HIS PERFORMANCES HAVE BEEN SEEN
19-227-0062 I LEAVE IT TO MY READER'S SAGACITY TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH OF ALL THIS IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR HENRY TO COMMUNICATE AT THIS TIME TO CATHERINE HOW MUCH OF IT HE COULD HAVE LEARNT FROM HIS FATHER
19-227-0063 IN WHAT POINTS HIS OWN CONJECTURES MIGHT ASSIST HIM AND WHAT PORTION MUST YET REMAIN TO BE TOLD IN A LETTER FROM JAMES
19-227-0064 CATHERINE AT ANY RATE HEARD ENOUGH TO FEEL THAT IN SUSPECTING GENERAL TILNEY OF EITHER MURDERING OR SHUTTING UP HIS WIFE SHE HAD SCARCELY SINNED AGAINST HIS CHARACTER OR MAGNIFIED HIS CRUELTY
19-227-0065 HENRY IN HAVING SUCH THINGS TO RELATE OF HIS FATHER WAS ALMOST AS PITIABLE AS IN THEIR FIRST AVOWAL TO HIMSELF HE BLUSHED FOR THE NARROW MINDED COUNSEL WHICH HE WAS OBLIGED TO EXPOSE
19-227-0066 THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEM AT NORTHANGER HAD BEEN OF THE MOST UNFRIENDLY KIND HENRY'S INDIGNATION ON HEARING HOW CATHERINE HAD BEEN TREATED ON COMPREHENDING HIS FATHER'S VIEWS AND BEING ORDERED TO ACQUIESCE IN THEM
19-227-0067 HAD BEEN OPEN AND BOLD THE GENERAL ACCUSTOMED ON EVERY ORDINARY OCCASION TO GIVE THE LAW IN HIS FAMILY PREPARED FOR NO RELUCTANCE BUT OF FEELING
19-227-0068 NO OPPOSING DESIRE THAT SHOULD DARE TO CLOTHE ITSELF IN WORDS COULD ILL BROOK THE OPPOSITION OF HIS SON STEADY AS THE SANCTION OF REASON AND THE DICTATE OF CONSCIENCE COULD MAKE IT BUT IN SUCH A CAUSE HIS ANGER
19-227-0069 THOUGH IT MUST SHOCK COULD NOT INTIMIDATE HENRY WHO WAS SUSTAINED IN HIS PURPOSE BY A CONVICTION OF ITS JUSTICE HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND AS MUCH IN HONOUR AS IN AFFECTION TO MISS MORLAND
19-227-0070 AND BELIEVING THAT HEART TO BE HIS OWN WHICH HE HAD BEEN DIRECTED TO GAIN NO UNWORTHY RETRACTION OF A TACIT CONSENT
19-227-0071 HE STEADILY REFUSED TO ACCOMPANY HIS FATHER INTO HEREFORDSHIRE AN ENGAGEMENT FORMED ALMOST AT THE MOMENT TO PROMOTE THE DISMISSAL OF CATHERINE AND AS STEADILY DECLARED HIS INTENTION OF OFFERING HER HIS HAND
19-227-0072 THE GENERAL WAS FURIOUS IN HIS ANGER AND THEY PARTED IN DREADFUL DISAGREEMENT HENRY IN AN AGITATION OF MIND WHICH MANY SOLITARY HOURS WERE REQUIRED TO COMPOSE
196-122150-0000 CHAPTER TWO AFTER TWO YEARS OF TRAINING HE WENT TO SEA AND ENTERING THE REGIONS SO WELL KNOWN TO HIS IMAGINATION FOUND THEM STRANGELY BARREN OF ADVENTURE HE MADE MANY VOYAGES
196-122150-0001 HE KNEW THE MAGIC MONOTONY OF EXISTENCE BETWEEN SKY AND WATER HE HAD TO BEAR THE CRITICISM OF MEN THE EXACTIONS OF THE SEA AND THE PROSAIC SEVERITY OF THE DAILY TASK THAT GIVES BREAD BUT WHOSE ONLY REWARD IS IN THE PERFECT LOVE OF THE WORK
196-122150-0002 THE EDGE OF HIS TEMPER AND THE FIBRE OF HIS STUFF THAT REVEAL THE QUALITY OF HIS RESISTANCE AND THE SECRET TRUTH OF HIS PRETENCES NOT ONLY TO OTHERS BUT ALSO TO HIMSELF
196-122150-0003 THERE ARE MANY SHADES IN THE DANGER OF ADVENTURES AND GALES AND IT IS ONLY NOW AND THEN THAT THERE APPEARS ON THE FACE OF FACTS A SINISTER VIOLENCE OF INTENTION THAT INDEFINABLE SOMETHING WHICH FORCES IT UPON THE MIND AND THE HEART OF A MAN
196-122150-0004 THAT THIS COMPLICATION OF ACCIDENTS OR THESE ELEMENTAL FURIES ARE COMING AT HIM WITH A PURPOSE OF MALICE WITH A STRENGTH BEYOND CONTROL WITH AN UNBRIDLED CRUELTY THAT MEANS TO TEAR OUT OF HIM HIS HOPE AND HIS FEAR
196-122150-0005 THE SUNSHINE THE MEMORIES THE FUTURE WHICH MEANS TO SWEEP THE WHOLE PRECIOUS WORLD UTTERLY AWAY FROM HIS SIGHT BY THE SIMPLE AND APPALLING ACT OF TAKING HIS LIFE JIM
196-122150-0006 DISABLED BY A FALLING SPAR AT THE BEGINNING OF A WEEK OF WHICH HIS SCOTTISH CAPTAIN USED TO SAY AFTERWARDS MAN IT'S A PAIRFECT MEERACLE TO ME HOW SHE LIVED THROUGH IT SPENT MANY DAYS STRETCHED ON HIS BACK DAZED BATTERED HOPELESS
196-122150-0007 AND TORMENTED AS IF AT THE BOTTOM OF AN ABYSS OF UNREST HE DID NOT CARE WHAT THE END WOULD BE AND IN HIS LUCID MOMENTS OVERVALUED HIS INDIFFERENCE THE DANGER WHEN NOT SEEN HAS THE IMPERFECT VAGUENESS OF HUMAN THOUGHT
196-122150-0008 HE LAY THERE BATTENED DOWN IN THE MIDST OF A SMALL DEVASTATION AND FELT SECRETLY GLAD HE HAD NOT TO GO ON DECK BUT NOW AND AGAIN AN UNCONTROLLABLE RUSH OF ANGUISH WOULD GRIP HIM BODILY
196-122150-0009 AND THEN THE UNINTELLIGENT BRUTALITY OF AN EXISTENCE LIABLE TO THE AGONY OF SUCH SENSATIONS FILLED HIM WITH A DESPAIRING DESIRE TO ESCAPE AT ANY COST THEN FINE WEATHER RETURNED AND HE THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT IT
196-122150-0010 HIS LAMENESS HOWEVER PERSISTED AND WHEN THE SHIP ARRIVED AT AN EASTERN PORT HE HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL HIS RECOVERY WAS SLOW AND HE WAS LEFT BEHIND
196-122150-0011 AFFLICTED BY SOME MYSTERIOUS TROPICAL DISEASE WHO HELD THE DOCTOR FOR AN ASS AND INDULGED IN SECRET DEBAUCHERIES OF PATENT MEDICINE WHICH HIS TAMIL SERVANT USED TO SMUGGLE IN WITH UNWEARIED DEVOTION THEY TOLD EACH OTHER THE STORY OF THEIR LIVES
196-122150-0012 PLAYED CARDS A LITTLE OR YAWNING AND IN PYJAMAS LOUNGED THROUGH THE DAY IN EASY CHAIRS WITHOUT SAYING A WORD THE HOSPITAL STOOD ON A HILL AND A GENTLE BREEZE ENTERING THROUGH THE WINDOWS ALWAYS FLUNG WIDE OPEN
196-122150-0013 BROUGHT INTO THE BARE ROOM THE SOFTNESS OF THE SKY THE LANGUOR OF THE EARTH THE BEWITCHING BREATH OF THE EASTERN WATERS THERE WERE PERFUMES IN IT SUGGESTIONS OF INFINITE REPOSE THE GIFT OF ENDLESS DREAMS
196-122150-0014 JIM LOOKED EVERY DAY OVER THE THICKETS OF GARDENS BEYOND THE ROOFS OF THE TOWN OVER THE FRONDS OF PALMS GROWING ON THE SHORE AT THAT ROADSTEAD WHICH IS A THOROUGHFARE TO THE EAST AT THE ROADSTEAD DOTTED BY GARLANDED ISLETS
196-122150-0015 LIGHTED BY FESTAL SUNSHINE ITS SHIPS LIKE TOYS ITS BRILLIANT ACTIVITY RESEMBLING A HOLIDAY PAGEANT WITH THE ETERNAL SERENITY OF THE EASTERN SKY OVERHEAD AND THE SMILING PEACE OF THE EASTERN SEAS
196-122150-0016 HE ASSOCIATED NATURALLY WITH THE MEN OF HIS CALLING IN THE PORT THESE WERE OF TWO KINDS SOME VERY FEW AND SEEN THERE BUT SELDOM LED MYSTERIOUS LIVES
196-122150-0017 HAD PRESERVED AN UNDEFACED ENERGY WITH THE TEMPER OF BUCCANEERS AND THE EYES OF DREAMERS THEY APPEARED TO LIVE IN A CRAZY MAZE OF PLANS HOPES DANGERS ENTERPRISES AHEAD OF CIVILISATION IN THE DARK PLACES OF THE SEA
196-122150-0018 HAD REMAINED AS OFFICERS OF COUNTRY SHIPS THEY HAD NOW A HORROR OF THE HOME SERVICE WITH ITS HARDER CONDITIONS SEVERER VIEW OF DUTY AND THE HAZARD OF STORMY OCEANS THEY WERE ATTUNED TO THE ETERNAL PEACE OF EASTERN SKY AND SEA
196-122150-0019 HOW THIS ONE HAD AN EASY BILLET IN JAPAN SOMEWHERE AND THAT ONE WAS DOING WELL IN THE SIAMESE NAVY AND IN ALL THEY SAID IN THEIR ACTIONS IN THEIR LOOKS IN THEIR PERSONS COULD BE DETECTED THE SOFT SPOT THE PLACE OF DECAY
196-122150-0020 THE DETERMINATION TO LOUNGE SAFELY THROUGH EXISTENCE TO JIM THAT GOSSIPING CROWD VIEWED AS SEAMEN SEEMED AT FIRST MORE UNSUBSTANTIAL THAN SO MANY SHADOWS BUT AT LENGTH HE FOUND A FASCINATION IN THE SIGHT OF THOSE MEN
196-122150-0021 IN THEIR APPEARANCE OF DOING SO WELL ON SUCH A SMALL ALLOWANCE OF DANGER AND TOIL IN TIME BESIDE THE ORIGINAL DISDAIN THERE GREW UP SLOWLY ANOTHER SENTIMENT AND SUDDENLY GIVING UP THE IDEA OF GOING HOME
196-122150-0022 SHE WAS OWNED BY A CHINAMAN CHARTERED BY AN ARAB AND COMMANDED BY A SORT OF RENEGADE NEW SOUTH WALES GERMAN VERY ANXIOUS TO CURSE PUBLICLY HIS NATIVE COUNTRY BUT WHO APPARENTLY ON THE STRENGTH OF BISMARCK'S VICTORIOUS POLICY
196-122150-0023 BRUTALISED ALL THOSE HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF AND WORE A BLOOD AND IRON AIR COMBINED WITH A PURPLE NOSE AND A RED MOUSTACHE AFTER SHE HAD BEEN PAINTED OUTSIDE AND WHITEWASHED INSIDE EIGHT HUNDRED PILGRIMS MORE OR LESS
196-122150-0024 THEY STREAMED ABOARD OVER THREE GANGWAYS THEY STREAMED IN URGED BY FAITH AND THE HOPE OF PARADISE THEY STREAMED IN WITH A CONTINUOUS TRAMP AND SHUFFLE OF BARE FEET WITHOUT A WORD A MURMUR OR A LOOK BACK
196-122150-0025 AND WHEN CLEAR OF CONFINING RAILS SPREAD ON ALL SIDES OVER THE DECK FLOWED FORWARD AND AFT OVERFLOWED DOWN THE YAWNING HATCHWAYS FILLED THE INNER RECESSES OF THE SHIP LIKE WATER FILLING A CISTERN
196-122150-0026 LIKE WATER FLOWING INTO CREVICES AND CRANNIES LIKE WATER RISING SILENTLY EVEN WITH THE RIM EIGHT HUNDRED MEN AND WOMEN WITH FAITH AND HOPES WITH AFFECTIONS AND MEMORIES THEY HAD COLLECTED THERE
196-122150-0027 COMING FROM NORTH AND SOUTH AND FROM THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE EAST AFTER TREADING THE JUNGLE PATHS DESCENDING THE RIVERS COASTING IN PRAUS ALONG THE SHALLOWS CROSSING IN SMALL CANOES FROM ISLAND TO ISLAND PASSING THROUGH SUFFERING
196-122150-0028 MEETING STRANGE SIGHTS BESET BY STRANGE FEARS UPHELD BY ONE DESIRE THEY CAME FROM SOLITARY HUTS IN THE WILDERNESS FROM POPULOUS CAMPONGS FROM VILLAGES BY THE SEA AT THE CALL OF AN IDEA
196-122150-0029 THEY HAD LEFT THEIR FORESTS THEIR CLEARINGS THE PROTECTION OF THEIR RULERS THEIR PROSPERITY THEIR POVERTY THE SURROUNDINGS OF THEIR YOUTH AND THE GRAVES OF THEIR FATHERS THEY CAME COVERED WITH DUST WITH SWEAT WITH GRIME WITH RAGS
196-122150-0030 THE STRONG MEN AT THE HEAD OF FAMILY PARTIES THE LEAN OLD MEN PRESSING FORWARD WITHOUT HOPE OF RETURN YOUNG BOYS WITH FEARLESS EYES GLANCING CURIOUSLY SHY LITTLE GIRLS WITH TUMBLED LONG HAIR
196-122150-0031 THE TIMID WOMEN MUFFLED UP AND CLASPING TO THEIR BREASTS WRAPPED IN LOOSE ENDS OF SOILED HEAD CLOTHS THEIR SLEEPING BABIES THE UNCONSCIOUS PILGRIMS OF AN EXACTING BELIEF
196-122150-0032 SAID THE GERMAN SKIPPER TO HIS NEW CHIEF MATE AN ARAB THE LEADER OF THAT PIOUS VOYAGE CAME LAST HE WALKED SLOWLY ABOARD HANDSOME AND GRAVE IN HIS WHITE GOWN AND LARGE TURBAN A STRING OF SERVANTS FOLLOWED LOADED WITH HIS LUGGAGE
196-122150-0033 AND ON THE SECRET PURPOSES OF THEIR HEARTS THE STEAMER POUNDED IN THE DUSK THE CALM WATER OF THE STRAIT AND FAR ASTERN OF THE PILGRIM SHIP A SCREW PILE LIGHTHOUSE PLANTED BY UNBELIEVERS ON A TREACHEROUS SHOAL SEEMED TO WINK AT HER
196-122150-0034 ITS EYE OF FLAME AS IF IN DERISION OF HER ERRAND OF FAITH SHE CLEARED THE STRAIT CROSSED THE BAY CONTINUED ON HER WAY THROUGH THE ONE DEGREE PASSAGE SHE HELD ON STRAIGHT FOR THE RED SEA UNDER A SERENE SKY
196-122150-0035 ENVELOPED IN A FULGOR OF SUNSHINE THAT KILLED ALL THOUGHT OPPRESSED THE HEART WITHERED ALL IMPULSES OF STRENGTH AND ENERGY AND UNDER THE SINISTER SPLENDOUR OF THAT SKY THE SEA BLUE AND PROFOUND REMAINED STILL WITHOUT A STIR
196-122150-0036 WITHOUT A RIPPLE WITHOUT A WRINKLE VISCOUS STAGNANT DEAD THE PATNA WITH A SLIGHT HISS PASSED OVER THAT PLAIN LUMINOUS AND SMOOTH UNROLLED A BLACK RIBBON OF SMOKE ACROSS THE SKY
196-122150-0037 GLIDED PAST ON HIS DESCENT AND SANK MYSTERIOUSLY INTO THE SEA EVENING AFTER EVENING PRESERVING THE SAME DISTANCE AHEAD OF HER ADVANCING BOWS THE FIVE WHITES ON BOARD LIVED AMIDSHIPS ISOLATED FROM THE HUMAN CARGO
196-122150-0038 THE AWNINGS COVERED THE DECK WITH A WHITE ROOF FROM STEM TO STERN AND A FAINT HUM A LOW MURMUR OF SAD VOICES ALONE REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF A CROWD OF PEOPLE UPON THE GREAT BLAZE OF THE OCEAN
196-122150-0039 SUCH WERE THE DAYS STILL HOT HEAVY DISAPPEARING ONE BY ONE INTO THE PAST AS IF FALLING INTO AN ABYSS FOR EVER OPEN IN THE WAKE OF THE SHIP AND THE SHIP LONELY UNDER A WISP OF SMOKE
196-122150-0040 HELD ON HER STEADFAST WAY BLACK AND SMOULDERING IN A LUMINOUS IMMENSITY AS IF SCORCHED BY A FLAME FLICKED AT HER FROM A HEAVEN WITHOUT PITY
196-122152-0000 HE SAID SPEAKING OF THE SHIP SHE WENT OVER WHATEVER IT WAS AS EASY AS A SNAKE CRAWLING OVER A STICK THE ILLUSTRATION WAS GOOD THE QUESTIONS WERE AIMING AT FACTS
196-122152-0001 AND THE OFFICIAL INQUIRY WAS BEING HELD IN THE POLICE COURT OF AN EASTERN PORT HE STOOD ELEVATED IN THE WITNESS BOX WITH BURNING CHEEKS IN A COOL LOFTY ROOM
196-122152-0002 THE BIG FRAMEWORK OF PUNKAHS MOVED GENTLY TO AND FRO HIGH ABOVE HIS HEAD AND FROM BELOW MANY EYES WERE LOOKING AT HIM OUT OF DARK FACES OUT OF WHITE FACES OUT OF RED FACES OUT OF FACES ATTENTIVE SPELLBOUND
196-122152-0003 AS IF ALL THESE PEOPLE SITTING IN ORDERLY ROWS UPON NARROW BENCHES HAD BEEN ENSLAVED BY THE FASCINATION OF HIS VOICE IT WAS VERY LOUD IT RANG STARTLING IN HIS OWN EARS IT WAS THE ONLY SOUND AUDIBLE IN THE WORLD
196-122152-0004 FOR THE TERRIBLY DISTINCT QUESTIONS THAT EXTORTED HIS ANSWERS SEEMED TO SHAPE THEMSELVES IN ANGUISH AND PAIN WITHIN HIS BREAST CAME TO HIM POIGNANT AND SILENT
196-122152-0005 OUTSIDE THE COURT THE SUN BLAZED WITHIN WAS THE WIND OF GREAT PUNKAHS THAT MADE YOU SHIVER THE SHAME THAT MADE YOU BURN THE ATTENTIVE EYES WHOSE GLANCE STABBED THE FACE OF THE PRESIDING MAGISTRATE
196-122152-0006 CLEAN SHAVED AND IMPASSIBLE LOOKED AT HIM DEADLY PALE BETWEEN THE RED FACES OF THE TWO NAUTICAL ASSESSORS THE LIGHT OF A BROAD WINDOW UNDER THE CEILING FELL FROM ABOVE ON THE HEADS AND SHOULDERS OF THE THREE MEN
196-122152-0007 AS IF FACTS COULD EXPLAIN ANYTHING AFTER YOU HAD CONCLUDED YOU HAD COLLIDED WITH SOMETHING FLOATING AWASH SAY A WATER LOGGED WRECK YOU WERE ORDERED BY YOUR CAPTAIN TO GO FORWARD AND ASCERTAIN IF THERE WAS ANY DAMAGE DONE
196-122152-0008 LOOKING AT JIM WITH THOUGHTFUL BLUE EYES THE OTHER A HEAVY SCORNFUL MAN THROWN BACK IN HIS SEAT HIS LEFT ARM EXTENDED FULL LENGTH DRUMMED DELICATELY WITH HIS FINGER TIPS ON A BLOTTING PAD IN THE MIDDLE THE MAGISTRATE
196-122152-0009 I WAS TOLD TO CALL NO ONE AND TO MAKE NO NOISE FOR FEAR OF CREATING A PANIC I THOUGHT THE PRECAUTION REASONABLE I TOOK ONE OF THE LAMPS THAT WERE HUNG UNDER THE AWNINGS AND WENT FORWARD AFTER OPENING THE FOREPEAK HATCH I HEARD SPLASHING IN THERE
196-122152-0010 HIS FINGERS PLAYED INCESSANTLY TOUCHING THE PAPER WITHOUT NOISE I DID NOT THINK OF DANGER JUST THEN I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE STARTLED ALL THIS HAPPENED IN SUCH A QUIET WAY AND SO VERY SUDDENLY
196-122152-0011 I KNEW THERE WAS NO OTHER BULKHEAD IN THE SHIP BUT THE COLLISION BULKHEAD SEPARATING THE FOREPEAK FROM THE FOREHOLD I WENT BACK TO TELL THE CAPTAIN I CAME UPON THE SECOND ENGINEER GETTING UP AT THE FOOT OF THE BRIDGE LADDER HE SEEMED DAZED AND
196-122152-0012 TOLD ME HE THOUGHT HIS LEFT ARM WAS BROKEN HE HAD SLIPPED ON THE TOP STEP WHEN GETTING DOWN WHILE I WAS FORWARD HE EXCLAIMED MY GOD THAT ROTTEN BULKHEAD'LL GIVE WAY IN A MINUTE
196-122152-0013 HE DID NOT STRIKE HIM AGAIN HE STOOD BENDING OVER HIM AND SPEAKING ANGRILY BUT QUITE LOW
196-122152-0014 STOP THE ENGINES INSTEAD OF MAKING A ROW ABOUT IT ON DECK I HEARD HIM SAY GET UP RUN FLY HE SWORE ALSO THE ENGINEER SLID DOWN THE STARBOARD LADDER AND BOLTED ROUND THE SKYLIGHT TO THE ENGINE ROOM COMPANION
196-122152-0015 WHICH WAS ON THE PORT SIDE HE MOANED AS HE RAN HE SPOKE SLOWLY HE REMEMBERED SWIFTLY AND WITH EXTREME VIVIDNESS HE COULD HAVE REPRODUCED LIKE AN ECHO THE MOANING OF THE ENGINEER FOR THE BETTER INFORMATION OF THESE MEN
196-122152-0016 WHO WANTED FACTS AFTER HIS FIRST FEELING OF REVOLT HE HAD COME ROUND TO THE VIEW THAT ONLY A METICULOUS PRECISION OF STATEMENT WOULD BRING OUT THE TRUE HORROR BEHIND THE APPALLING FACE OF THINGS
196-122152-0017 THE FACTS THOSE MEN WERE SO EAGER TO KNOW HAD BEEN VISIBLE TANGIBLE OPEN TO THE SENSES OCCUPYING THEIR PLACE IN SPACE AND TIME REQUIRING FOR THEIR EXISTENCE A FOURTEEN HUNDRED TON STEAMER
196-122152-0018 PERDITION THAT DWELT WITHIN LIKE A MALEVOLENT SOUL IN A DETESTABLE BODY HE WAS ANXIOUS TO MAKE THIS CLEAR THIS HAD NOT BEEN A COMMON AFFAIR EVERYTHING IN IT HAD BEEN OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
196-122152-0019 AND FORTUNATELY HE REMEMBERED EVERYTHING HE WANTED TO GO ON TALKING FOR TRUTH'S SAKE PERHAPS FOR HIS OWN SAKE ALSO AND WHILE HIS UTTERANCE WAS DELIBERATE HIS MIND POSITIVELY FLEW ROUND AND ROUND THE SERRIED CIRCLE OF FACTS
196-122152-0020 HE SEEMED CALM ENOUGH ONLY HE STUMBLED SEVERAL TIMES AND ONCE AS I STOOD SPEAKING TO HIM HE WALKED RIGHT INTO ME AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN STONE BLIND HE MADE NO DEFINITE ANSWER TO WHAT I HAD TO TELL
196-122152-0021 FELT A SHIVER RUN DOWN HIS BACK THE BIG ASSESSOR HAD DROPPED HIS EYELIDS AND DRUMMED ON WITHOUT A SOUND CARELESS AND MOURNFUL THE EYES OF THE OTHER ABOVE THE SUNBURNT CLASPED FINGERS
196-122152-0022 THE MAGISTRATE HAD SWAYED FORWARD
196-122152-0023 HE RESTED HIS TEMPLE IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND THE WIND OF THE PUNKAHS EDDIED DOWN ON THE HEADS ON THE DARK FACED NATIVES WOUND ABOUT IN VOLUMINOUS DRAPERIES ON THE EUROPEANS SITTING TOGETHER VERY HOT
196-122152-0024 AND IN DRILL SUITS THAT SEEMED TO FIT THEM AS CLOSE AS THEIR SKINS AND HOLDING THEIR ROUND PITH HATS ON THEIR KNEES WHILE GLIDING ALONG THE WALLS THE COURT PEONS BUTTONED TIGHT IN LONG WHITE COATS FLITTED RAPIDLY TO AND FRO
196-122152-0025 RESTED UPON A WHITE MAN WHO SAT APART FROM THE OTHERS WITH HIS FACE WORN AND CLOUDED BUT WITH QUIET EYES THAT GLANCED STRAIGHT INTERESTED AND CLEAR JIM ANSWERED ANOTHER QUESTION AND WAS TEMPTED TO CRY OUT
196-122152-0026 WHAT'S THE GOOD OF THIS WHAT'S THE GOOD HE TAPPED WITH HIS FOOT SLIGHTLY BIT HIS LIP AND LOOKED AWAY OVER THE HEADS HE MET THE EYES OF THE WHITE MAN THE GLANCE DIRECTED AT HIM WAS NOT THE FASCINATED STARE OF THE OTHERS
196-122152-0027 IT WAS AN ACT OF INTELLIGENT VOLITION JIM BETWEEN TWO QUESTIONS FORGOT HIMSELF SO FAR AS TO FIND LEISURE FOR A THOUGHT THIS FELLOW RAN THE THOUGHT LOOKS AT ME AS THOUGH HE COULD SEE SOMEBODY OR SOMETHING PAST MY SHOULDER
196-122152-0028 HE HAD COME ACROSS THAT MAN BEFORE IN THE STREET PERHAPS HE WAS POSITIVE HE HAD NEVER SPOKEN TO HIM FOR DAYS FOR MANY DAYS HE HAD SPOKEN TO NO ONE BUT HAD HELD SILENT INCOHERENT AND ENDLESS CONVERSE WITH HIMSELF
196-122152-0029 LIKE A PRISONER ALONE IN HIS CELL OR LIKE A WAYFARER LOST IN A WILDERNESS AT PRESENT HE WAS ANSWERING QUESTIONS THAT DID NOT MATTER THOUGH THEY HAD A PURPOSE BUT HE DOUBTED WHETHER HE WOULD EVER AGAIN SPEAK OUT AS LONG AS HE LIVED
196-122152-0030 THE SOUND OF HIS OWN TRUTHFUL STATEMENTS CONFIRMED HIS DELIBERATE OPINION THAT SPEECH WAS OF NO USE TO HIM ANY LONGER THAT MAN THERE SEEMED TO BE AWARE OF HIS HOPELESS DIFFICULTY JIM LOOKED AT HIM THEN TURNED AWAY
196-122152-0031 AND AUDIBLY PERHAPS IT WOULD BE AFTER DINNER ON A VERANDAH DRAPED IN MOTIONLESS FOLIAGE AND CROWNED WITH FLOWERS IN THE DEEP DUSK SPECKLED BY FIERY CIGAR ENDS THE ELONGATED BULK OF EACH CANE CHAIR
196-122152-0032 HARBOURED A SILENT LISTENER NOW AND THEN A SMALL RED GLOW WOULD MOVE ABRUPTLY AND EXPANDING LIGHT UP THE FINGERS OF A LANGUID HAND PART OF A FACE IN PROFOUND REPOSE OR FLASH A CRIMSON GLEAM INTO A PAIR OF PENSIVE EYES
196-122152-0033 OVERSHADOWED BY A FRAGMENT OF AN UNRUFFLED FOREHEAD AND WITH THE VERY FIRST WORD UTTERED MARLOW'S BODY EXTENDED AT REST IN THE SEAT WOULD BECOME VERY STILL AS THOUGH HIS SPIRIT HAD WINGED ITS WAY BACK INTO THE LAPSE OF TIME
196-122159-0000 AT HIS BACK WAS THE DARK NIGHT WITH THE CLEAR STARS WHOSE DISTANT GLITTER DISPOSED IN RETREATING PLANES LURED THE EYE INTO THE DEPTHS OF A GREATER DARKNESS
196-122159-0001 AND YET A MYSTERIOUS LIGHT SEEMED TO SHOW ME HIS BOYISH HEAD AS IF IN THAT MOMENT THE YOUTH WITHIN HIM HAD FOR A MOMENT GLOWED AND EXPIRED YOU ARE AN AWFUL GOOD SORT TO LISTEN
196-122159-0002 LIKE THIS HE SAID IT DOES ME GOOD YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO ME YOU DON'T WORDS SEEMED TO FAIL HIM IT WAS A DISTINCT GLIMPSE HE WAS A YOUNGSTER OF THE SORT YOU LIKE TO SEE ABOUT YOU
196-122159-0003 OF THE SORT YOU LIKE TO IMAGINE YOURSELF TO HAVE BEEN OF THE SORT WHOSE APPEARANCE CLAIMS THE FELLOWSHIP OF THESE ILLUSIONS YOU HAD THOUGHT GONE OUT EXTINCT COLD AND WHICH AS IF REKINDLED AT THE APPROACH OF ANOTHER FLAME
196-122159-0004 YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS FOR A FELLOW IN MY POSITION TO BE BELIEVED MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT TO AN ELDER MAN IT IS SO DIFFICULT SO AWFULLY UNFAIR SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND
196-122159-0005 THE MISTS WERE CLOSING AGAIN I DON'T KNOW HOW OLD I APPEARED TO HIM AND HOW MUCH WISE NOT HALF AS OLD AS I FELT JUST THEN NOT HALF AS USELESSLY WISE AS I KNEW MYSELF TO BE
196-122159-0006 SURELY IN NO OTHER CRAFT AS IN THAT OF THE SEA DO THE HEARTS OF THOSE ALREADY LAUNCHED TO SINK OR SWIM GO OUT SO MUCH TO THE YOUTH ON THE BRINK LOOKING WITH SHINING EYES UPON THAT
196-122159-0007 GLITTER OF THE VAST SURFACE WHICH IS ONLY A REFLECTION OF HIS OWN GLANCES FULL OF FIRE THERE IS SUCH MAGNIFICENT VAGUENESS IN THE EXPECTATIONS THAT HAD DRIVEN EACH OF US TO SEA SUCH A GLORIOUS INDEFINITENESS
196-122159-0008 SUCH A BEAUTIFUL GREED OF ADVENTURES THAT ARE THEIR OWN AND ONLY REWARD WHAT WE GET WELL WE WON'T TALK OF THAT BUT CAN ONE OF US RESTRAIN A SMILE
196-122159-0009 IN NO OTHER KIND OF LIFE IS THE ILLUSION MORE WIDE OF REALITY IN NO OTHER IS THE BEGINNING ALL ILLUSION THE DISENCHANTMENT MORE SWIFT THE SUBJUGATION MORE COMPLETE
196-122159-0010 HADN'T WE ALL COMMENCED WITH THE SAME DESIRE ENDED WITH THE SAME KNOWLEDGE CARRIED THE MEMORY OF THE SAME CHERISHED GLAMOUR THROUGH THE SORDID DAYS OF IMPRECATION WHAT WONDER THAT WHEN SOME
196-122159-0011 HEAVY PROD GETS HOME THE BOND IS FOUND TO BE CLOSE THAT BESIDES THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE CRAFT THERE IS FELT THE STRENGTH OF A WIDER FEELING THE FEELING THAT BINDS A MAN TO A CHILD HE WAS THERE BEFORE ME BELIEVING THAT
196-122159-0012 AND HE HAD BEEN DELIBERATING UPON DEATH CONFOUND HIM HE HAD FOUND THAT TO MEDITATE ABOUT BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE HAD SAVED HIS LIFE WHILE ALL ITS GLAMOUR HAD GONE WITH THE SHIP IN THE NIGHT WHAT MORE NATURAL
196-122159-0013 AND HIS VOICE SPOKE I WAS SO LOST YOU KNOW IT WAS THE SORT OF THING ONE DOES NOT EXPECT TO HAPPEN TO ONE IT WAS NOT LIKE A FIGHT FOR INSTANCE
196-122159-0014 HE APPEARED CHANGED AS IF HE HAD SUDDENLY MATURED ONE COULDN'T BE SURE HE MUTTERED AH YOU WERE NOT SURE I SAID
196-122159-0015 AND WAS PLACATED BY THE SOUND OF A FAINT SIGH THAT PASSED BETWEEN US LIKE THE FLIGHT OF A BIRD IN THE NIGHT WELL I WASN'T HE SAID COURAGEOUSLY IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT WRETCHED STORY THEY MADE UP IT WAS NOT A LIE
196-122159-0016 BUT IT WASN'T TRUTH ALL THE SAME IT WAS SOMETHING ONE KNOWS A DOWNRIGHT LIE THERE WAS NOT THE THICKNESS OF A SHEET OF PAPER BETWEEN THE RIGHT AND THE WRONG OF THIS AFFAIR
196-122159-0017 HOW MUCH MORE DID YOU WANT I ASKED BUT I THINK I SPOKE SO LOW THAT HE DID NOT CATCH WHAT I SAID HE HAD ADVANCED HIS ARGUMENT AS THOUGH LIFE HAD BEEN A NETWORK OF
196-122159-0018 HIS VOICE SOUNDED REASONABLE SUPPOSE I HAD NOT I MEAN TO SAY SUPPOSE I HAD STUCK TO THE SHIP WELL HOW MUCH LONGER SAY A MINUTE HALF A MINUTE
196-122159-0019 I INTERJECTED I WOULD HAVE MEANT TO BE HE RETORTED AND THAT'S MORE THAN I MEANT WHEN I HE SHIVERED AS IF ABOUT TO SWALLOW SOME NAUSEOUS DRUG JUMPED
196-122159-0020 HE PRONOUNCED WITH A CONVULSIVE EFFORT WHOSE STRESS AS IF PROPAGATED BY THE WAVES OF THE AIR MADE MY BODY STIR A LITTLE IN THE CHAIR HE FIXED ME WITH LOWERING EYES DON'T YOU BELIEVE ME HE CRIED I SWEAR
196-122159-0021 I OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN I AM I AM A GENTLEMAN TOO YES YES I SAID HASTILY HE WAS LOOKING ME SQUARELY IN THE FACE AND WITHDREW HIS GAZE SLOWLY
196-122159-0022 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND WHY I DIDN'T AFTER ALL DIDN'T GO OUT IN THAT WAY I WASN'T GOING TO BE FRIGHTENED AT WHAT I HAD DONE AND ANYHOW IF I HAD STUCK TO THE SHIP I WOULD HAVE DONE MY BEST TO BE SAVED
196-122159-0023 MEN HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO FLOAT FOR HOURS IN THE OPEN SEA AND BE PICKED UP NOT MUCH THE WORSE FOR IT I MIGHT HAVE LASTED IT OUT BETTER THAN MANY OTHERS THERE'S NOTHING THE MATTER WITH MY HEART
196-122159-0024 A HAIR'S BREADTH HE MUTTERED NOT THE BREADTH OF A HAIR BETWEEN THIS AND THAT AND AT THE TIME IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE A HAIR AT MIDNIGHT I PUT IN
196-122159-0025 A LITTLE VICIOUSLY I FEAR DON'T YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN BY THE SOLIDARITY OF THE CRAFT I WAS AGGRIEVED AGAINST HIM AS THOUGH HE HAD CHEATED ME
196-122159-0026 KEEP UP THE ILLUSION OF MY BEGINNINGS AS THOUGH HE HAD ROBBED OUR COMMON LIFE OF THE LAST SPARK OF ITS GLAMOUR AND SO YOU CLEARED OUT AT ONCE JUMPED HE CORRECTED ME INCISIVELY JUMPED MIND
196-122159-0027 HE REPEATED AND I WONDERED AT THE EVIDENT BUT OBSCURE INTENTION WELL YES PERHAPS I COULD NOT SEE THEN BUT I HAD PLENTY OF TIME AND ANY AMOUNT OF LIGHT IN THAT BOAT AND I COULD THINK TOO
196-122159-0028 NOBODY WOULD KNOW OF COURSE BUT THIS DID NOT MAKE IT ANY EASIER FOR ME YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE THAT TOO I DID NOT WANT ALL THIS TALK NO YES I WON'T LIE
196-122159-0029 I WANTED IT IT IS THE VERY THING I WANTED THERE DO YOU THINK YOU OR ANYBODY COULD HAVE MADE ME IF I I AM I AM NOT AFRAID TO TELL AND I WASN'T AFRAID TO THINK EITHER I LOOKED IT IN THE FACE
196-122159-0030 I WASN'T GOING TO RUN AWAY AT FIRST AT NIGHT IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THOSE FELLOWS I MIGHT HAVE NO BY HEAVENS I WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE THEM THAT SATISFACTION THEY HAD DONE ENOUGH THEY MADE UP A STORY AND BELIEVED IT FOR ALL I KNOW
196-122159-0031 BUT I KNEW THE TRUTH AND I WOULD LIVE IT DOWN ALONE WITH MYSELF I WASN'T GOING TO GIVE IN TO SUCH A BEASTLY UNFAIR THING WHAT DID IT PROVE AFTER ALL I WAS CONFOUNDEDLY CUT UP SICK OF LIFE
196-122159-0032 NO THE PROPER THING WAS TO FACE IT OUT ALONE FOR MYSELF WAIT FOR ANOTHER CHANCE
198-126831-0000 FRIDAY WAS A COMFORTABLE DAY IN THE HOUSEHOLD OF KING EVERYBODY WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR THE STORY GIRL SPARKLED THROUGH SEVERAL TALES THAT RANGED FROM THE AFRITES AND JINNS OF EASTERN MYTH THROUGH THE PIPING DAYS OF CHIVALRY DOWN TO THE HOMELY ANECDOTES OF CARLISLE WORKADAY FOLKS
198-126831-0001 SHE WAS IN TURN AN ORIENTAL PRINCESS BEHIND A SILKEN VEIL THE BRIDE WHO FOLLOWED HER BRIDEGROOM TO THE WARS OF PALESTINE DISGUISED AS A PAGE THE GALLANT LADY WHO RANSOMED HER DIAMOND NECKLACE BY DANCING A CORANTO
198-126831-0002 WITH A HIGHWAYMAN ON A MOONLIT HEATH AND BUSKIRK'S GIRL WHO JOINED THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF TEMPERANCE JUST TO SEE WHAT WAS INTO IT AND IN EACH IMPERSONATION SHE WAS SO THOROUGHLY THE THING IMPERSONATED
198-126831-0003 CECILY AND SARA RAY FOUND A SWEET NEW KNITTED LACE PATTERN IN AN OLD MAGAZINE
198-126831-0004 CHANCING ACCIDENTALLY I VOW TO OVERHEAR CERTAIN OF THESE SECRETS I LEARNED THAT SARA RAY HAD NAMED AN APPLE FOR JOHNNY PRICE AND CECILY TRUE'S YOU LIVE THERE WAS EIGHT SEEDS IN IT AND YOU KNOW EIGHT MEANS THEY BOTH LOVE
198-126831-0005 WHILE CECILY ADMITTED THAT WILLY FRASER HAD WRITTEN ON HIS SLATE AND SHOWED IT TO HER IF YOU LOVE ME AS I LOVE YOU NO KNIFE CAN CUT OUR LOVE IN TWO BUT SARA RAY NEVER YOU BREATHE THIS TO A LIVING SOUL
198-126831-0006 CECILY HOW OLD MUST WE BE BEFORE WE CAN HAVE A REAL BEAU BUT SARA ALWAYS DENIED IT SO I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE FELIX SIMPLY MADE IT UP HIMSELF PADDY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF BY CATCHING A RAT
198-126831-0007 AND BEING INTOLERABLY CONCEITED ABOUT IT UNTIL SARA RAY CURED HIM BY CALLING HIM A DEAR SWEET CAT AND KISSING HIM BETWEEN THE EARS THEN PAT SNEAKED ABJECTLY OFF HIS TAIL DROOPING
198-126831-0008 VERY FEW CATS HAVE AND MOST OF THEM HAVE SUCH AN INORDINATE APPETITE FOR FLATTERY THAT THEY WILL SWALLOW ANY AMOUNT OF IT AND THRIVE THEREON PADDY HAD A FINER TASTE THE STORY GIRL AND I WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO COULD PAY HIM COMPLIMENTS TO HIS LIKING
198-126831-0009 THE STORY GIRL WOULD BOX HIS EARS WITH HER FIST AND SAY BLESS YOUR GRAY HEART PADDY YOU'RE A GOOD SORT OF OLD RASCAL AND PAT WOULD PURR HIS SATISFACTION I USED TO TAKE A HANDFUL OF THE SKIN ON HIS BACK SHAKE HIM GENTLY AND SAY
198-126831-0010 PAT YOU'VE FORGOTTEN MORE THAN ANY HUMAN BEING EVER KNEW AND I VOW PADDY WOULD LICK HIS CHOPS WITH DELIGHT BUT TO BE CALLED A SWEET CAT OH SARA SARA
198-126831-0011 FELICITY TRIED AND HAD THE MOST GRATIFYING LUCK WITH A NEW AND COMPLICATED CAKE RECIPE A GORGEOUS COMPOUND
198-126831-0012 THE NUMBER OF EGGS SHE USED IN IT WOULD HAVE SHOCKED AUNT JANET'S THRIFTY SOUL BUT THAT CAKE LIKE BEAUTY WAS ITS OWN EXCUSE UNCLE ROGER ATE THREE SLICES OF IT AT TEA TIME AND TOLD FELICITY SHE WAS AN ARTIST
198-126831-0013 THE POOR MAN MEANT IT AS A COMPLIMENT BUT FELICITY WHO KNEW UNCLE BLAIR WAS AN ARTIST AND HAD A POOR OPINION OF SUCH FRY LOOKED INDIGNANT AND RETORTED INDEED SHE WASN'T
198-126831-0014 I'D LIKE TO SIGHED FELICITY BUT WE'D COME HOME TIRED AND WITH ALL THE MILKING TO DO YOU BOYS BETTER GO ALONE PETER AND I WILL ATTEND TO THE MILKING FOR ONE EVENING SAID UNCLE ROGER YOU CAN ALL GO
198-126831-0015 I HAVE AN IDEA THAT A RASPBERRY PIE FOR TO MORROW NIGHT WHEN THE FOLKS COME HOME WOULD HIT THE RIGHT SPOT ACCORDINGLY AFTER TEA WE ALL SET OFF ARMED WITH JUGS AND CUPS FELICITY THOUGHTFUL CREATURE ALSO TOOK A SMALL BASKETFUL OF JELLY COOKIES ALONG WITH HER
198-126831-0016 A PRETTY WALK THROUGH A WORLD OF GREEN WHISPERING BOUGHS AND SPICE SWEET FERNS AND SHIFTING PATCHES OF SUNLIGHT THE RASPBERRIES WERE PLENTIFUL
198-126831-0017 THEN WE FOREGATHERED AROUND A TINY WOOD SPRING COLD AND PELLUCID UNDER ITS YOUNG MAPLES AND ATE THE JELLY COOKIES AND THE STORY GIRL TOLD US A TALE OF A HAUNTED SPRING IN A MOUNTAIN GLEN WHERE A FAIR WHITE LADY DWELT
198-126831-0018 WHO PLEDGED ALL COMERS IN A GOLDEN CUP WITH JEWELS BRIGHT AND IF YOU DRANK OF THE CUP WITH HER SAID THE STORY GIRL HER EYES GLOWING THROUGH THE EMERALD DUSK ABOUT US YOU WERE NEVER SEEN IN THE WORLD AGAIN YOU WERE WHISKED STRAIGHTWAY TO FAIRYLAND AND LIVED THERE WITH A FAIRY BRIDE
198-126831-0019 I THINK THERE IS SUCH A PLACE IN SPITE OF UNCLE EDWARD SAID THE STORY GIRL DREAMILY AND I THINK THERE IS A WAY OF GETTING THERE TOO IF WE COULD ONLY FIND IT
198-126831-0020 ONE BITTER DAY WHEN THEY SEEK IT
198-126831-0021 AND THAT IS THE TRAGEDY OF LIFE ON THAT DAY THE GATES OF EDEN ARE SHUT BEHIND THEM AND THE AGE OF GOLD IS OVER HENCEFORTH THEY MUST DWELL IN THE COMMON LIGHT OF COMMON DAY ONLY A FEW WHO REMAIN CHILDREN AT HEART CAN EVER FIND THAT FAIR LOST PATH AGAIN
198-126831-0022 THEY AND ONLY THEY CAN BRING US TIDINGS FROM THAT DEAR COUNTRY WHERE WE ONCE SOJOURNED AND FROM WHICH WE MUST EVERMORE BE EXILES THE WORLD CALLS THEM ITS SINGERS AND POETS AND ARTISTS AND STORY TELLERS
198-126831-0023 AS WE SAT THERE THE AWKWARD MAN PASSED BY WITH HIS GUN OVER HIS SHOULDER AND HIS DOG AT HIS SIDE HE DID NOT LOOK LIKE AN AWKWARD MAN THERE IN THE HEART OF THE MAPLE WOODS
198-126831-0024 HE STRODE ALONG RIGHT MASTERFULLY AND LIFTED HIS HEAD WITH THE AIR OF ONE WHO WAS MONARCH OF ALL HE SURVEYED THE STORY GIRL KISSED HER FINGERTIPS TO HIM WITH THE DELIGHTFUL AUDACITY WHICH WAS A PART OF HER
198-126831-0025 YOU'D UNDERSTAND WHY IF YOU EVER SAW HIM AT A PARTY OR A PICNIC SAID FELICITY TRYING TO PASS PLATES AND DROPPING THEM WHENEVER A WOMAN LOOKED AT HIM THEY SAY IT'S PITIFUL TO SEE HIM I MUST GET WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THAT MAN NEXT SUMMER SAID THE STORY GIRL
198-126831-0026 IF I PUT IT OFF ANY LONGER IT WILL BE TOO LATE I'M GROWING SO FAST AUNT OLIVIA SAYS I'LL HAVE TO WEAR ANKLE SKIRTS NEXT SUMMER IF I BEGIN TO LOOK GROWN UP HE'LL GET FRIGHTENED OF ME AND THEN I'LL NEVER FIND OUT THE GOLDEN MILESTONE MYSTERY
198-126831-0027 DO YOU THINK HE'LL EVER TELL YOU WHO ALICE IS I ASKED I HAVE A NOTION WHO ALICE IS ALREADY SAID THE MYSTERIOUS CREATURE BUT SHE WOULD TELL US NOTHING MORE WHEN THE JELLY COOKIES WERE ALL EATEN IT WAS HIGH TIME TO BE MOVING HOMEWARD
198-126831-0028 AND THE PRECINCTS OF A POSSIBLY ENCHANTED SPRING WHEN WE REACHED THE FOOT OF THE ORCHARD AND ENTERED IT THROUGH A GAP IN THE HEDGE IT WAS THE MAGICAL MYSTICAL TIME OF BETWEEN LIGHTS OFF TO THE WEST WAS A DAFFODIL GLOW HANGING OVER THE VALLEY OF LOST SUNSETS
198-126831-0029 AND I GOT BACK ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO I SET DOWN ON THE FRONT DOOR STEPS FOR A MOMENT AND ALL AT ONCE I HEARD A BELL RING IN THE HOUSE EIGHT TIMES I TELL YOU I WAS SKEERED I MADE A BOLT FOR THE ORCHARD AND YOU WON'T CATCH ME GOING NEAR THAT HOUSE TILL YOUR UNCLE ROGER COMES HOME
198-126831-0030 THERE WE STOOD IN A HUDDLED DEMORALIZED GROUP OH WHAT AN EERIE PLACE THAT ORCHARD WAS WHAT SHADOWS WHAT NOISES
198-126831-0031 WELL HERE'S THE KEY GO AND SEE FOR YOURSELF SAID PETER FELICITY HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING AND SEEING I THINK YOU BOYS OUGHT TO GO SHE SAID RETREATING BEHIND THE DEFENCE OF SEX YOU OUGHT TO BE BRAVER THAN GIRLS
198-126831-0032 SOMEBODY KILLED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW NOTHING LIKE THAT EVER HAPPENED IN OUR FAMILY THE KINGS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RESPECTABLE PERHAPS IT IS EMILY
198-126831-0033 KING'S GHOST WHISPERED FELIX SHE NEVER APPEARED ANYWHERE BUT IN THE ORCHARD SAID THE STORY GIRL OH OH CHILDREN ISN'T THERE SOMETHING UNDER UNCLE ALEC'S TREE WE PEERED FEARFULLY THROUGH THE GLOOM THERE WAS SOMETHING SOMETHING THAT WAVERED AND FLUTTERED ADVANCED RETREATED
198-126831-0034 THAT'S ONLY MY OLD APRON SAID FELICITY I HUNG IT THERE TO DAY WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR THE WHITE HEN'S NEST OH WHAT SHALL WE DO UNCLE ROGER MAY NOT BE BACK FOR HOURS I CAN'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYTHING IN THE HOUSE MAYBE IT'S ONLY PEG BOWEN SUGGESTED DAN
198-126831-0035 THERE WAS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF COMFORT IN THIS WE WERE ALMOST AS MUCH AFRAID OF PEG BOWEN AS WE WOULD BE OF ANY SPECTRAL VISITANT PETER SCOFFED AT THE IDEA PEG BOWEN WASN'T IN THE HOUSE BEFORE YOUR UNCLE ROGER LOCKED IT UP AND HOW COULD SHE GET IN AFTERWARDS HE SAID
198-126831-0036 NO IT ISN'T PEG BOWEN IT'S SOMETHING THAT WALKS I KNOW A STORY ABOUT A GHOST SAID THE STORY GIRL THE RULING PASSION STRONG EVEN IN EXTREMITY IT IS ABOUT A GHOST WITH EYEHOLES BUT NO EYES
198-126831-0037 DON'T CRIED CECILY HYSTERICALLY DON'T YOU GO ON DON'T YOU SAY ANOTHER WORD I CAN'T BEAR IT DON'T YOU THE STORY GIRL DIDN'T BUT SHE HAD SAID ENOUGH
198-126831-0038 ALL AT ONCE SOMETHING LEAPED FROM THE BOUGH OF A TREE AND ALIGHTED BEFORE US WE SPLIT THE AIR WITH A SIMULTANEOUS SHRIEK
198-126831-0039 HE STRUGGLED OUT OF MY CLASP AND DISAPPEARED OVER THE LONG GRASSES WITH SOUNDLESS LEAPS
198-126831-0040 HE WAS A STRANGE FURTIVE ANIMAL A QUESTING BEAST PRESENTLY THE MOON ROSE BUT THIS ONLY MADE MATTERS WORSE THE SHADOWS HAD BEEN STILL BEFORE NOW THEY MOVED AND DANCED AS THE NIGHT WIND TOSSED THE BOUGHS THE OLD HOUSE WITH ITS DREADFUL SECRET
198-126831-0041 WAS WHITE AND CLEAR AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND OF SPRUCES WE WERE WOEFULLY TIRED BUT WE COULD NOT SIT DOWN BECAUSE THE GRASS WAS REEKING WITH DEW THE FAMILY GHOST ONLY APPEARS IN DAYLIGHT SAID THE STORY GIRL
198-126831-0042 I KNOW HE'LL LAUGH AT US AWFUL BUT IT'S BETTER TO BE LAUGHED AT THAN SCARED LIKE THIS UNCLE ROGER DID NOT COME UNTIL NEARLY TEN NEVER WAS THERE A MORE WELCOME SOUND THAN THE RUMBLE OF HIS WHEELS IN THE LANE
198-126831-0043 WE RAN TO THE ORCHARD GATE AND SWARMED ACROSS THE YARD JUST AS UNCLE ROGER ALIGHTED AT THE FRONT DOOR HE STARED AT US IN THE MOONLIGHT
198-126831-0044 THERE'S NO USE ASKING THE MEANING OF THIS I SUPPOSE SAID UNCLE ROGER WITH THE CALM OF DESPAIR I'VE GAVE UP TRYING TO FATHOM YOU YOUNG ONES PETER WHERE'S THE KEY WHAT YARN HAVE YOU BEEN TELLING
198-126831-0045 UNCLE ROGER UNLOCKED AND FLUNG OPEN THE FRONT DOOR AS HE DID SO CLEAR AND SWEET RANG OUT TEN BELL LIKE CHIMES
198-126831-0046 WE HAD TO WAIT UNTIL UNCLE ROGER STOPPED LAUGHING BEFORE WE HEARD THE EXPLANATION WE THOUGHT HE NEVER WOULD STOP
198-126831-0047 AND NOW IT HAS ALMOST FRIGHTENED YOU POOR LITTLE MONKEYS TO DEATH WE HEARD UNCLE ROGER CHUCKLING ALL THE WAY TO THE BARN
198-126831-0048 I WAS SO FRIGHTENED I WOULDN'T MIND IF HE'D LAUGH ONCE AND HAVE IT DONE WITH IT
198-126831-0049 I SHALL TELL IT TOO I DON'T CARE IF THE JOKE IS AS MUCH ON MYSELF AS ANY ONE A STORY IS A STORY NO MATTER WHO IT'S ON BUT IT IS HATEFUL TO BE LAUGHED AT AND GROWN UPS ALWAYS DO IT I NEVER WILL WHEN I'M GROWN UP I'LL REMEMBER BETTER
198-126831-0050 IT'S ALL PETER'S FAULT SAID FELICITY I DO THINK HE MIGHT HAVE HAD MORE SENSE THAN TO TAKE A CLOCK STRIKING FOR A BELL RINGING
198-126831-0051 IT DON'T SOUND A BIT LIKE OTHER CLOCKS
198-126831-0052 I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID THE STORY GIRL HONESTLY I THOUGHT IT WAS A BELL WHEN I HEARD IT AND THE DOOR OPEN TOO LET US BE FAIR FELICITY
198-126831-0053 BUT IT WAS OVER TWO HOURS SINCE WE HAD EATEN THE COOKIES AND FELICITY SUGGESTED THAT A SAUCERFUL APIECE
198-129977-0000 ELINOR SAW WITH GREAT UNEASINESS THE LOW SPIRITS OF HER FRIEND HIS VISIT AFFORDED HER BUT A VERY PARTIAL SATISFACTION
198-129977-0001 WHILE HIS OWN ENJOYMENT IN IT APPEARED SO IMPERFECT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS UNHAPPY SHE WISHED IT WERE EQUALLY EVIDENT THAT HE STILL DISTINGUISHED HER BY THE SAME AFFECTION WHICH ONCE SHE HAD FELT NO DOUBT OF INSPIRING
198-129977-0002 BUT HITHERTO THE CONTINUANCE OF HIS PREFERENCE SEEMED VERY UNCERTAIN AND THE RESERVEDNESS OF HIS MANNER TOWARDS HER CONTRADICTED ONE MOMENT WHAT A MORE ANIMATED LOOK HAD INTIMATED THE PRECEDING ONE
198-129977-0003 HE JOINED HER AND MARIANNE IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE OTHERS WERE DOWN AND MARIANNE WHO WAS ALWAYS EAGER TO PROMOTE THEIR HAPPINESS AS FAR AS SHE COULD SOON LEFT THEM TO THEMSELVES BUT BEFORE SHE WAS HALF WAY UPSTAIRS SHE HEARD THE PARLOUR DOOR OPEN
198-129977-0004 AS YOU ARE NOT YET READY FOR BREAKFAST
198-129977-0005 THIS WAS A SUBJECT WHICH ENSURED MARIANNE'S ATTENTION AND SHE WAS BEGINNING TO DESCRIBE HER OWN ADMIRATION OF THESE SCENES
198-129977-0006 WHEN EDWARD INTERRUPTED HER BY SAYING YOU MUST NOT ENQUIRE TOO FAR MARIANNE REMEMBER I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE IN THE PICTURESQUE AND I SHALL OFFEND YOU BY MY IGNORANCE AND WANT OF TASTE IF WE COME TO PARTICULARS
198-129977-0007 WHICH OUGHT TO BE IRREGULAR AND RUGGED AND DISTANT OBJECTS OUT OF SIGHT WHICH OUGHT ONLY TO BE INDISTINCT THROUGH THE SOFT MEDIUM OF A HAZY ATMOSPHERE YOU MUST BE SATISFIED WITH SUCH ADMIRATION AS I CAN HONESTLY GIVE I CALL IT A VERY FINE COUNTRY
198-129977-0008 THE HILLS ARE STEEP THE WOODS SEEM FULL OF FINE TIMBER
198-129977-0009 I CAN EASILY BELIEVE IT TO BE FULL OF ROCKS AND PROMONTORIES GREY MOSS AND BRUSH WOOD BUT THESE ARE ALL LOST ON ME I KNOW NOTHING OF THE PICTURESQUE
198-129977-0010 I AM AFRAID IT IS BUT TOO TRUE SAID MARIANNE BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BOAST OF IT I SUSPECT SAID ELINOR THAT TO AVOID ONE KIND OF AFFECTATION EDWARD HERE FALLS INTO ANOTHER BECAUSE HE BELIEVES MANY PEOPLE PRETEND TO MORE ADMIRATION OF THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE THAN THEY REALLY FEEL
198-129977-0011 AND IS DISGUSTED WITH SUCH PRETENSIONS HE AFFECTS GREATER INDIFFERENCE AND LESS DISCRIMINATION IN VIEWING THEM HIMSELF THAN HE POSSESSES HE IS FASTIDIOUS AND WILL HAVE AN AFFECTATION OF HIS OWN IT IS VERY TRUE SAID MARIANNE THAT ADMIRATION OF LANDSCAPE SCENERY
198-129977-0012 IS BECOME A MERE JARGON EVERY BODY PRETENDS TO FEEL AND TRIES TO DESCRIBE WITH THE TASTE AND ELEGANCE OF HIM WHO FIRST DEFINED WHAT PICTURESQUE BEAUTY WAS I DETEST JARGON OF EVERY KIND AND SOMETIMES I HAVE KEPT MY FEELINGS TO MYSELF
198-129977-0013 BECAUSE I COULD FIND NO LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE THEM IN BUT WHAT WAS WORN AND HACKNEYED OUT OF ALL SENSE AND MEANING I AM CONVINCED SAID EDWARD THAT YOU REALLY FEEL ALL THE DELIGHT IN A FINE PROSPECT WHICH YOU PROFESS TO FEEL
198-129977-0014 BUT IN RETURN YOUR SISTER MUST ALLOW ME TO FEEL NO MORE THAN I PROFESS I LIKE A FINE PROSPECT BUT NOT ON PICTURESQUE PRINCIPLES I DO NOT LIKE CROOKED TWISTED BLASTED TREES I ADMIRE THEM MUCH MORE IF THEY ARE TALL STRAIGHT AND FLOURISHING
198-129977-0015 I DO NOT LIKE RUINED TATTERED COTTAGES I AM NOT FOND OF NETTLES OR THISTLES OR HEATH BLOSSOMS I HAVE MORE PLEASURE IN A SNUG FARM HOUSE THAN A WATCH TOWER
198-129977-0016 MARIANNE LOOKED WITH AMAZEMENT AT EDWARD WITH COMPASSION AT HER SISTER
198-129977-0017 TILL A NEW OBJECT SUDDENLY ENGAGED HER ATTENTION SHE WAS SITTING BY EDWARD AND IN TAKING HIS TEA FROM MISSUS DASHWOOD HIS HAND PASSED SO DIRECTLY BEFORE HER AS TO MAKE A RING WITH A PLAIT OF HAIR IN THE CENTRE VERY CONSPICUOUS ON ONE OF HIS FINGERS
198-129977-0018 BUT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HER HAIR HAD BEEN DARKER MARIANNE SPOKE INCONSIDERATELY WHAT SHE REALLY FELT BUT WHEN SHE SAW HOW MUCH SHE HAD PAINED EDWARD HER OWN VEXATION AT HER WANT OF THOUGHT COULD NOT BE SURPASSED BY HIS
198-129977-0019 HE COLOURED VERY DEEPLY AND GIVING A MOMENTARY GLANCE AT ELINOR REPLIED YES IT IS MY SISTER'S HAIR THE SETTING ALWAYS CASTS A DIFFERENT SHADE ON IT YOU KNOW ELINOR HAD MET HIS EYE AND LOOKED CONSCIOUS LIKEWISE
198-129977-0020 THAT THE HAIR WAS HER OWN SHE INSTANTANEOUSLY FELT AS WELL SATISFIED AS MARIANNE THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN THEIR CONCLUSIONS WAS THAT WHAT MARIANNE CONSIDERED AS A FREE GIFT FROM HER SISTER ELINOR WAS CONSCIOUS MUST HAVE BEEN PROCURED BY SOME THEFT OR CONTRIVANCE UNKNOWN TO HERSELF
198-129977-0021 SHE WAS NOT IN A HUMOUR HOWEVER TO REGARD IT AS AN AFFRONT AND AFFECTING TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF WHAT PASSED BY INSTANTLY TALKING OF SOMETHING ELSE SHE INTERNALLY RESOLVED HENCEFORWARD TO CATCH EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF EYEING THE HAIR AND OF SATISFYING HERSELF BEYOND ALL DOUBT
198-129977-0022 THAT IT WAS EXACTLY THE SHADE OF HER OWN EDWARD'S EMBARRASSMENT LASTED SOME TIME AND IT ENDED IN AN ABSENCE OF MIND STILL MORE SETTLED HE WAS PARTICULARLY GRAVE THE WHOLE MORNING MARIANNE SEVERELY CENSURED HERSELF FOR WHAT SHE HAD SAID
198-129977-0023 BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY THEY WERE VISITED BY SIR JOHN AND MISSUS JENNINGS WHO HAVING HEARD OF THE ARRIVAL OF A GENTLEMAN AT THE COTTAGE CAME TO TAKE A SURVEY OF THE GUEST WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS MOTHER IN LAW SIR JOHN WAS NOT LONG IN DISCOVERING
198-129977-0024 THAT THE NAME OF FERRARS BEGAN WITH AN F AND THIS PREPARED A FUTURE MINE OF RAILLERY AGAINST THE DEVOTED ELINOR WHICH NOTHING BUT THE NEWNESS OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WITH EDWARD COULD HAVE PREVENTED FROM BEING IMMEDIATELY SPRUNG
198-129977-0025 BUT AS IT WAS SHE ONLY LEARNED FROM SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT LOOKS HOW FAR THEIR PENETRATION FOUNDED ON MARGARET'S INSTRUCTIONS EXTENDED SIR JOHN NEVER CAME TO THE DASHWOODS WITHOUT EITHER INVITING THEM TO DINE AT THE PARK THE NEXT DAY OR TO DRINK TEA WITH THEM THAT EVENING
198-129977-0026 ON THE PRESENT OCCASION FOR THE BETTER ENTERTAINMENT OF THEIR VISITOR TOWARDS WHOSE AMUSEMENT HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND TO CONTRIBUTE HE WISHED TO ENGAGE THEM FOR BOTH YOU MUST DRINK TEA WITH US TO NIGHT SAID HE
198-129977-0027 MISSUS JENNINGS ENFORCED THE NECESSITY AND WHO KNOWS BUT YOU MAY RAISE A DANCE SAID SHE AND THAT WILL TEMPT YOU MISS MARIANNE A DANCE CRIED MARIANNE IMPOSSIBLE WHO IS TO DANCE WHO WHY YOURSELVES AND THE CAREYS AND WHITAKERS TO BE SURE
198-129977-0028 WHAT YOU THOUGHT NOBODY COULD DANCE BECAUSE A CERTAIN PERSON THAT SHALL BE NAMELESS IS GONE I WISH WITH ALL MY SOUL CRIED SIR JOHN THAT WILLOUGHBY WERE AMONG US AGAIN THIS AND MARIANNE'S BLUSHING GAVE NEW SUSPICIONS TO EDWARD
198-129977-0029 AND WHO IS WILLOUGHBY SAID HE IN A LOW VOICE TO MISS DASHWOOD BY WHOM HE WAS SITTING SHE GAVE HIM A BRIEF REPLY
198-129977-0030 EDWARD SAW ENOUGH TO COMPREHEND NOT ONLY THE MEANING OF OTHERS BUT SUCH OF MARIANNE'S EXPRESSIONS AS HAD PUZZLED HIM BEFORE AND WHEN THEIR VISITORS LEFT THEM HE WENT IMMEDIATELY ROUND HER AND SAID IN A WHISPER I HAVE BEEN GUESSING SHALL I TELL YOU MY GUESS
198-129977-0031 WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHALL I TELL YOU CERTAINLY WELL THEN I GUESS THAT MISTER WILLOUGHBY HUNTS MARIANNE WAS SURPRISED AND CONFUSED YET SHE COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT THE QUIET ARCHNESS OF HIS MANNER AND AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE SAID
198-129977-0032 HOPE I AM SURE YOU WILL LIKE HIM
198-209-0000 MISSUS ALLEN SAID CATHERINE THE NEXT MORNING WILL THERE BE ANY HARM IN MY CALLING ON MISS TILNEY TODAY I SHALL NOT BE EASY TILL I HAVE EXPLAINED EVERYTHING GO BY ALL MEANS MY DEAR ONLY PUT ON A WHITE GOWN MISS TILNEY ALWAYS WEARS WHITE
198-209-0001 CATHERINE CHEERFULLY COMPLIED AND BEING PROPERLY EQUIPPED WAS MORE IMPATIENT THAN EVER TO BE AT THE PUMP ROOM THAT SHE MIGHT INFORM HERSELF OF GENERAL TILNEY'S LODGINGS FOR THOUGH SHE BELIEVED THEY WERE IN MILSOM STREET SHE WAS NOT CERTAIN OF THE HOUSE
198-209-0002 AND MISSUS ALLEN'S WAVERING CONVICTIONS ONLY MADE IT MORE DOUBTFUL TO MILSOM STREET SHE WAS DIRECTED AND HAVING MADE HERSELF PERFECT IN THE NUMBER HASTENED AWAY WITH EAGER STEPS AND A BEATING HEART TO PAY HER VISIT EXPLAIN HER CONDUCT AND BE FORGIVEN
198-209-0003 TRIPPING LIGHTLY THROUGH THE CHURCH YARD AND RESOLUTELY TURNING AWAY HER EYES THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BE OBLIGED TO SEE HER BELOVED ISABELLA AND HER DEAR FAMILY WHO SHE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE WERE IN A SHOP HARD BY SHE REACHED THE HOUSE WITHOUT ANY IMPEDIMENT LOOKED AT THE NUMBER
198-209-0004 AND WITH A LOOK WHICH DID NOT QUITE CONFIRM HIS WORDS SAID HE HAD BEEN MISTAKEN FOR THAT MISS TILNEY WAS WALKED OUT CATHERINE WITH A BLUSH OF MORTIFICATION LEFT THE HOUSE SHE FELT ALMOST PERSUADED THAT MISS TILNEY WAS AT HOME AND TOO MUCH OFFENDED TO ADMIT HER
198-209-0005 AND AS SHE RETIRED DOWN THE STREET COULD NOT WITHHOLD ONE GLANCE AT THE DRAWING ROOM WINDOWS IN EXPECTATION OF SEEING HER THERE
198-209-0006 AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STREET HOWEVER SHE LOOKED BACK AGAIN AND THEN NOT AT A WINDOW BUT ISSUING FROM THE DOOR SHE SAW MISS TILNEY HERSELF SHE WAS FOLLOWED BY A GENTLEMAN WHOM CATHERINE BELIEVED TO BE HER FATHER AND THEY TURNED UP TOWARDS EDGAR'S BUILDINGS
198-209-0007 CATHERINE IN DEEP MORTIFICATION PROCEEDED ON HER WAY SHE COULD ALMOST BE ANGRY HERSELF AT SUCH ANGRY INCIVILITY BUT SHE CHECKED THE RESENTFUL SENSATION SHE REMEMBERED HER OWN IGNORANCE SHE KNEW NOT HOW SUCH AN OFFENCE AS HERS MIGHT BE CLASSED BY THE LAWS OF WORLDLY POLITENESS
198-209-0008 TO WHAT A DEGREE OF UNFORGIVINGNESS IT MIGHT WITH PROPRIETY LEAD NOR TO WHAT RIGOURS OF RUDENESS IN RETURN IT MIGHT JUSTLY MAKE HER AMENABLE DEJECTED AND HUMBLED SHE HAD EVEN SOME THOUGHTS OF NOT GOING WITH THE OTHERS TO THE THEATRE THAT NIGHT
198-209-0009 FOR SHE SOON RECOLLECTED IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT SHE WAS WITHOUT ANY EXCUSE FOR STAYING AT HOME AND IN THE SECOND
198-209-0010 TO THE THEATRE ACCORDINGLY THEY ALL WENT NO TILNEYS APPEARED TO PLAGUE OR PLEASE HER SHE FEARED THAT AMONGST THE MANY PERFECTIONS OF THE FAMILY A FONDNESS FOR PLAYS WAS NOT TO BE RANKED BUT PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE HABITUATED TO THE FINER PERFORMANCES OF THE LONDON STAGE
198-209-0011 ON THE BEGINNING OF THE FIFTH HOWEVER THE SUDDEN VIEW OF MISTER HENRY TILNEY AND HIS FATHER JOINING A PARTY IN THE OPPOSITE BOX RECALLED HER TO ANXIETY AND DISTRESS THE STAGE COULD NO LONGER EXCITE GENUINE MERRIMENT NO LONGER KEEP HER WHOLE ATTENTION
198-209-0012 EVERY OTHER LOOK UPON AN AVERAGE WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE OPPOSITE BOX AND FOR THE SPACE OF TWO ENTIRE SCENES DID SHE THUS WATCH HENRY TILNEY WITHOUT BEING ONCE ABLE TO CATCH HIS EYE NO LONGER COULD HE BE SUSPECTED OF INDIFFERENCE FOR A PLAY
198-209-0013 HIS NOTICE WAS NEVER WITHDRAWN FROM THE STAGE DURING TWO WHOLE SCENES
198-209-0014 AND FORCED HIM TO HEAR HER EXPLANATION FEELINGS RATHER NATURAL THAN HEROIC POSSESSED HER INSTEAD OF CONSIDERING HER OWN DIGNITY INJURED BY THIS READY CONDEMNATION INSTEAD OF PROUDLY RESOLVING IN CONSCIOUS INNOCENCE
198-209-0015 TO SHOW HER RESENTMENT TOWARDS HIM WHO COULD HARBOUR A DOUBT OF IT TO LEAVE TO HIM ALL THE TROUBLE OF SEEKING AN EXPLANATION AND TO ENLIGHTEN HIM ON THE PAST ONLY BY AVOIDING HIS SIGHT OR FLIRTING WITH SOMEBODY ELSE SHE TOOK TO HERSELF ALL THE SHAME OF MISCONDUCT
198-209-0016 OR AT LEAST OF ITS APPEARANCE AND WAS ONLY EAGER FOR AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXPLAINING ITS CAUSE THE PLAY CONCLUDED THE CURTAIN FELL HENRY TILNEY WAS NO LONGER TO BE SEEN WHERE HE HAD HITHERTO SAT BUT HIS FATHER REMAINED
198-209-0017 AND PERHAPS HE MIGHT BE NOW COMING ROUND TO THEIR BOX SHE WAS RIGHT IN A FEW MINUTES HE APPEARED
198-209-0018 YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT ME SO RUDE BUT INDEED IT WAS NOT MY OWN FAULT WAS IT MISSUS ALLEN DID NOT THEY TELL ME THAT MISTER TILNEY AND HIS SISTER WERE GONE OUT IN A PHAETON TOGETHER AND THEN WHAT COULD I DO BUT I HAD TEN THOUSAND TIMES RATHER HAVE BEEN WITH YOU
198-209-0019 MY DEAR YOU TUMBLE MY GOWN WAS MISSUS ALLEN'S REPLY HER ASSURANCE HOWEVER STANDING SOLE AS IT DID WAS NOT THROWN AWAY IT BROUGHT A MORE CORDIAL MORE NATURAL SMILE INTO HIS COUNTENANCE
198-209-0020 AND HE REPLIED IN A TONE WHICH RETAINED ONLY A LITTLE AFFECTED RESERVE WE WERE MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU AT ANY RATE FOR WISHING US A PLEASANT WALK AFTER OUR PASSING YOU IN ARGYLE STREET YOU WERE SO KIND AS TO LOOK BACK ON PURPOSE
198-209-0021 BUT INDEED I DID NOT WISH YOU A PLEASANT WALK I NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING BUT I BEGGED MISTER THORPE SO EARNESTLY TO STOP I CALLED OUT TO HIM AS SOON AS EVER I SAW YOU NOW MISSUS ALLEN DID NOT OH YOU WERE NOT THERE BUT INDEED I DID AND IF MISTER THORPE WOULD ONLY HAVE STOPPED
198-209-0022 I WOULD HAVE JUMPED OUT AND RUN AFTER YOU IS THERE A HENRY IN THE WORLD WHO COULD BE INSENSIBLE TO SUCH A DECLARATION HENRY TILNEY AT LEAST WAS NOT WITH A YET SWEETER SMILE HE SAID EVERYTHING THAT NEED BE SAID OF HIS SISTER'S CONCERN REGRET
198-209-0023 AND DEPENDENCE ON CATHERINE'S HONOUR OH DO NOT SAY MISS TILNEY WAS NOT ANGRY CRIED CATHERINE BECAUSE I KNOW SHE WAS FOR SHE WOULD NOT SEE ME THIS MORNING WHEN I CALLED I SAW HER WALK OUT OF THE HOUSE THE NEXT MINUTE AFTER MY LEAVING IT I WAS HURT BUT I WAS NOT AFFRONTED
198-209-0024 PERHAPS YOU DID NOT KNOW I HAD BEEN THERE I WAS NOT WITHIN AT THE TIME BUT I HEARD OF IT FROM ELEANOR AND SHE HAS BEEN WISHING EVER SINCE TO SEE YOU TO EXPLAIN THE REASON OF SUCH INCIVILITY BUT PERHAPS I CAN DO IT AS WELL IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN THAT MY FATHER
198-209-0025 AND HE BEING HURRIED FOR TIME AND NOT CARING TO HAVE IT PUT OFF MADE A POINT OF HER BEING DENIED THAT WAS ALL I DO ASSURE YOU
198-209-0026 AND MEANT TO MAKE HER APOLOGY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE CATHERINE'S MIND WAS GREATLY EASED BY THIS INFORMATION YET A SOMETHING OF SOLICITUDE REMAINED FROM WHICH SPRANG THE FOLLOWING QUESTION THOROUGHLY ARTLESS IN ITSELF THOUGH RATHER DISTRESSING TO THE GENTLEMAN BUT MISTER TILNEY
198-209-0027 WHY WERE YOU LESS GENEROUS THAN YOUR SISTER IF SHE FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE IN MY GOOD INTENTIONS AND COULD SUPPOSE IT TO BE ONLY A MISTAKE WHY SHOULD YOU BE SO READY TO TAKE OFFENCE ME I TAKE OFFENCE
198-209-0028 NAY I AM SURE BY YOUR LOOK WHEN YOU CAME INTO THE BOX YOU WERE ANGRY I ANGRY I COULD HAVE NO RIGHT WELL NOBODY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU HAD NO RIGHT WHO SAW YOUR FACE HE REPLIED BY ASKING HER TO MAKE ROOM FOR HIM AND TALKING OF THE PLAY HE REMAINED WITH THEM SOME TIME
198-209-0029 AND WAS ONLY TOO AGREEABLE FOR CATHERINE TO BE CONTENTED WHEN HE WENT AWAY BEFORE THEY PARTED HOWEVER IT WAS AGREED THAT THE PROJECTED WALK SHOULD BE TAKEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND SETTING ASIDE THE MISERY OF HIS QUITTING THEIR BOX
198-209-0030 SHE WAS UPON THE WHOLE LEFT ONE OF THE HAPPIEST CREATURES IN THE WORLD WHILE TALKING TO EACH OTHER
198-209-0031 WAS ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH GENERAL TILNEY
198-209-0032 WHAT COULD THEY HAVE TO SAY OF HER SHE FEARED GENERAL TILNEY DID NOT LIKE HER APPEARANCE SHE FOUND IT WAS IMPLIED IN HIS PREVENTING HER ADMITTANCE TO HIS DAUGHTER RATHER THAN POSTPONE HIS OWN WALK A FEW MINUTES HOW CAME MISTER THORPE TO KNOW YOUR FATHER WAS HER ANXIOUS INQUIRY
198-209-0033 AS SHE POINTED THEM OUT TO HER COMPANION HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT BUT HIS FATHER LIKE EVERY MILITARY MAN
198-209-0034 WHEN THE ENTERTAINMENT WAS OVER THORPE CAME TO ASSIST THEM IN GETTING OUT CATHERINE WAS THE IMMEDIATE OBJECT OF HIS GALLANTRY AND WHILE THEY WAITED IN THE LOBBY FOR A CHAIR HE PREVENTED THE INQUIRY WHICH HAD TRAVELLED FROM HER HEART ALMOST TO THE TIP OF HER TONGUE BY ASKING
198-209-0035 IN A CONSEQUENTIAL MANNER WHETHER SHE HAD SEEN HIM TALKING WITH GENERAL TILNEY HE IS A FINE OLD FELLOW UPON MY SOUL STOUT ACTIVE LOOKS AS YOUNG AS HIS SON I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR HIM I ASSURE YOU
198-209-0036 KNOW HIM THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE MUCH ABOUT TOWN THAT I DO NOT KNOW I HAVE MET HIM FOREVER AT THE BEDFORD AND I KNEW HIS FACE AGAIN TODAY THE MOMENT HE CAME INTO THE BILLIARD ROOM ONE OF THE BEST PLAYERS WE HAVE BY THE BY AND WE HAD A LITTLE TOUCH TOGETHER THOUGH I WAS ALMOST AFRAID OF HIM AT FIRST
198-209-0037 THE ODDS WERE FIVE TO FOUR AGAINST ME AND IF I HAD NOT MADE ONE OF THE CLEANEST STROKES THAT PERHAPS EVER WAS MADE IN THIS WORLD I TOOK HIS BALL EXACTLY BUT I COULD NOT MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND IT WITHOUT A TABLE HOWEVER I DID BEAT HIM A VERY FINE FELLOW AS RICH AS A JEW
198-209-0038 LOWERING HIS VOICE WELL DONE GENERAL SAID I I AM QUITE OF YOUR MIND
1992-141719-0000 THE QUEEN WAS RECEIV'D AT BABYLON WITH ALL THE TRANSPORTS OF JOY THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE EXPRESS'D FOR THE SAFE RETURN OF SO ILLUSTRIOUS AND SO BEAUTIFUL A PERSONAGE THAT HAD RUN THRO SUCH A LONG SERIES OF MISFORTUNES
1992-141719-0001 BABYLON AT THAT TIME SEEM'D TO BE PERFECTLY SERENE AND QUIET AS FOR THE YOUNG PRINCE OF HYRCANIA HE WAS SLAIN IN BATTLE THE BABYLONIANS WHO WERE THE VICTORS
1992-141719-0002 WHO SHOULD GAIN IT BY A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL ELECTION THEY WERE DETERMIN'D THAT THE MOST VALUABLE POST OF HONOUR IN THE WORLD NAMELY
1992-141719-0003 AND THE SOVEREIGN OF BABYLON SHOULD BE THE RESULT OF MERIT ONLY AND NOT BE PROCUR'D BY ANY PARTY FACTIONS OR COURT INTRIGUES A SOLEMN OATH WAS VOLUNTARILY TAKEN BY ALL PARTIES
1992-141719-0004 THAT HE WHO SHOULD DISTINGUISH HIMSELF BY HIS SUPERIOR VALOUR AND WISDOM SHOULD UNANIMOUSLY BE ACKNOWLEDG'D THE SOVEREIGN ELECT A SPACIOUS LIST OR CIRCUS WAS PITCHED UPON SURROUNDED WITH COMMODIOUS SEATS
1992-141719-0005 ERECTED IN AN AMPHITHEATRICAL MANNER AND RICHLY EMBELLISH'D SOME FEW LEAGUES FROM THE CITY THITHER THE COMBATANTS OR CHAMPIONS WERE TO REPAIR COMPLEATLY ACCOUTRED EACH OF THEM HAD A DISTINCT APARTMENT TO HIMSELF BEHIND THE LISTS
1992-141719-0006 WHERE NO SOUL COULD EITHER SEE THEM OR KNOW WHO THEY WERE THEY WERE TO ENTER THE LISTS FOUR SEVERAL TIMES THOSE WHO WERE SO HAPPY AS TO CONQUER FOUR COMPETITORS WERE AFTERWARDS TO ENGAGE EACH OTHER IN SINGLE COMBAT
1992-141719-0007 IN ORDER THAT HE WHO SHOULD REMAIN MASTER OF THE FIELD SHOULD BE PROCLAIM'D THE HAPPY VICTOR FOUR DAYS AFTERWARDS THEY WERE TO MEET AGAIN ACCOUTRED AS BEFORE
1992-141719-0008 AND TO EXPLAIN ALL SUCH A ENIGMAS OR RIDDLES AS THE MAGI SHOULD THINK PROPER TO PROPOSE IF THEIR QUERIES SHOULD PROVE TOO INTRICATE AND PERPLEXT FOR THEM TO RESOLVE THEY WERE TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE LISTS AGAIN AND AFTER THAT TO FRESH A ENIGMAS
1992-141719-0009 BEFORE THEY COULD BE ENTITLED TO THE ELECTION SO THAT THE TOURNAMENTS WERE TO BE CONTINU'D TILL ONE OF THE CANDIDATES SHOULD BE TWICE A VICTOR AND SHINE AS CONSPICUOUS WITH RESPECT TO HIS INTERNAL QUALITIES AS TO HIS DEXTERITY AND ADDRESS IN HEROIC ATCHIEVEMENTS
1992-141719-0010 THE QUEEN IN THE MEAN TIME WAS TO BE NARROWLY WATCH'D AND ALLOW'D ONLY TO BE A SPECTATOR OF BOTH THEIR AMUSEMENTS AT SOME CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE AND MOREOVER TO BE COVER'D WITH A VAIL
1992-141719-0011 NOR WAS SHE INDULG'D SO FAR AS TO SPEAK ONE SINGLE WORD TO ANY CANDIDATE WHOMSOEVER IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE LEAST JEALOUSY OR SUSPICION EITHER OF PARTIALITY OR INJUSTICE
1992-141719-0012 TO INFORM HER LOVER OF ALL THE PRELIMINARY ARTICLES ABOVEMENTION'D NOT DOUBTING BUT THAT HE WOULD EXERT BOTH HIS COURAGE AND UNDERSTANDING FOR HER SAKE BEYOND ANY OF THE OTHER COMPETITORS ZADIG ACCORDINGLY SET OUT FOR BABYLON AND BESOUGHT THE GODDESS VENUS
1992-141719-0013 NOT ONLY TO FORTIFY HIS COURAGE BUT TO ILLUMINATE HIS MIND WITH WISDOM ON THIS IMPORTANT OCCASION THE NIGHT BEFORE THESE MARTIAL ATCHIEVEMENTS WERE TO COMMENCE ZADIG ARRIVED UPON THE BANKS OF THE EUPHRATES
1992-141719-0014 HE INSCRIB'D HIS DEVICE AMONGST THE LIST OF COMBATANTS CONCEALING AT THE SAME TIME BOTH HIS PERSON AND NAME AS THE LAWS OF THE ELECTION REQUIRED AND ACCORDINGLY WITHDREW TO THE APARTMENT THAT WAS PROVIDED FOR HIM
1992-141719-0015 ACCORDING TO HIS LOT CADOR WHO WAS JUST RETURN'D TO BABYLON HAVING HUNTED ALL EGYPT OVER TO NO PURPOSE IN HOPES TO FIND HIS FRIEND ZADIG BROUGHT A COMPLEAT SET OF ARMOUR INTO HIS LODGE BY EXPRESS ORDERS FROM THE QUEEN
1992-141719-0016 SHE SENT HIM LIKEWISE ONE OF THE FINEST HORSES IN ALL PERSIA
1992-141719-0017 WHICH REDOUBLED HIS VIGOUR AND HIS HOPES THE NEXT MORNING THE QUEEN BEING SEATED UNDER A CANOPY OF STATE ENRICH'D WITH PRECIOUS STONES AND THE AMPHITHEATRES BEING CROWDED WITH GENTLEMEN AND LADIES OF ALL RANKS AND CONDITIONS FROM BABYLON
1992-141719-0018 THE COMPETITORS MADE THEIR PERSONAL APPEARANCE IN THE CIRCUS EACH OF THEM WENT UP TO THE GRAND MAGUS AND LAID DOWN HIS PARTICULAR DEVICE AT HIS FEET THE DEVICES WERE DRAWN BY LOT THAT OF ZADIG WAS THE LAST
1992-141719-0019 ONE ITABOD BY NAME IMMENSELY RICH INDEED AND VERY HAUGHTY
1992-141719-0020 EXCEEDINGLY AWKWARD AND A MAN OF NO ACQUIR'D PARTS THE SYCOPHANTS THAT HOVER'D ROUND ABOUT HIM FLATTER'D HIM THAT A MAN OF HIS MERIT COULDN'T FAIL OF BEING KING HE IMPERIOUSLY REPLIED ONE OF MY MERIT MUST BE KING
1992-141719-0021 HIS ARMOUR WAS MADE OF PURE GOLD ENAMELL'D WITH GREEN THE HOUSINGS OF HIS SADDLE WERE GREEN AND HIS LANCE EMBELLISH'D WITH GREEN RIBBANDS EVERY ONE WAS SENSIBLE AT FIRST SIGHT
1992-141719-0022 BY ITOBAD'S MANNER OF MANAGING HIS HORSE THAT HE WAS NOT THE MAN WHOM HEAV'N HAD PITCH'D UPON TO SWAY THE BABYLONISH SCEPTER THE FIRST COMBATANT THAT TILTED WITH HIM THREW HIM OUT OF THE SADDLE THE SECOND FLUNG HIM QUITE OVER THE CRUPPER
1992-141719-0023 AND LAID HIM SPRAWLING ON THE GROUND WITH HIS HEELS QUIV'RING IN THE AIR ITOBAD TIS TRUE REMOUNTED BUT WITH SO ILL A GRACE
1992-141719-0024 THE THIRD DISDAINING TO USE HIS LANCE MADE ONLY A FEINT AT HIM THEN CATCH'D HOLD OF HIS RIGHT LEG AND WHIRLING HIM ROUND THREW HIM FLAT UPON THE SAND THE ESQUIRES WHO WERE THE ATTENDANTS RAN TO HIS ASSISTANCE
1992-141719-0025 AND WITH A SNEER REMOUNTED HIM THE FOURTH COMBATANT CATCH'D HOLD OF HIS LEFT LEG AND UNHORS'D HIM AGAIN HE WAS CONVEY'D THRO THE HISSING MULTITUDE TO HIS LODGE WHERE ACCORDING TO THE LAW IN THAT CASE PROVIDED HE WAS TO PASS THE NIGHT
1992-141719-0026 AND AS HE HOBBLED ALONG SAID HE TO THE ESQUIRES WHAT A SAD MISFORTUNE IS THIS TO ONE OF MY BIRTH AND CHARACTER THE OTHER CHAMPIONS PLAY'D THEIR PARTS MUCH BETTER AND ALL CAME OFF WITH CREDIT
1992-141719-0027 SOME CONQUER'D TWO OF THEIR ANTAGONISTS AND OTHERS WERE SO FAR SUCCESSFUL AS TO GET THE BETTER OF THREE NONE OF THEM HOWEVER EXCEPT PRINCE HOTTAM VANQUISH'D FOUR ZADIG AT LAST
1992-141719-0028 ONE AFTER THE OTHER WITH THE UTMOST EASE AND WITH SUCH AN AIR AND GRACE AS GAIN'D HIM UNIVERSAL APPLAUSE AS THE CASE STOOD THUS ZADIG AND HOTTAM WERE TO CLOSE THE DAY'S ENTERTAINMENT IN A SINGLE COMBAT
1992-141719-0029 THE ARMOUR OF THE LATTER WAS OF A BLUE COLOUR MIXT WITH GOLD AND THE HOUSINGS OF HIS SADDLE WERE OF THE SAME THOSE OF THE FORMER WHITE AS SNOW THE MULTITUDE WERE DIVIDED IN THEIR WISHES THE KNIGHT IN BLUE WAS THE FAVOURITE OF SOME OF THE LADIES
1992-141719-0030 THE QUEEN WHOSE HEART WAS IN A PERFECT PALPITATION PUT UP HER SECRET PRAYERS TO VENUS TO ASSIST HER DARLING HERO THE TWO CHAMPIONS MAKING THEIR PASSES AND THEIR VOLTA'S WITH THE UTMOST DEXTERITY AND ADDRESS
1992-141719-0031 AND KEEPING FIRM IN THEIR SADDLES GAVE EACH OTHER SUCH REBUFFS WITH THEIR LANCES THAT ALL THE SPECTATORS THE QUEEN ONLY EXCEPTED WISH'D FOR TWO KINGS OF BABYLON AT LAST THEIR HORSES BEING TIRED AND BOTH THEIR LANCES BROKE
1992-141719-0032 ZADIG MADE USE OF THE FOLLOWING STRATAGEM
1992-141719-0033 HE GOT ARTFULLY BEHIND HIM AND SHOOTING WITH A SPRING ON HIS HORSES BUTTOCKS GRASP'D HIM CLOSE THREW HIM HEADLONG ON THE SAND THEN JUMP'D INTO HIS SEAT AND WHEEL'D ROUND PRINCE HOTTAM WHILE HE LAY SPRAWLING ON THE GROUND ALL THE SPECTATORS IN GENERAL
1992-141719-0034 WITH LOUD ACCLAMATIONS CRIED OUT VICTORY VICTORY IN FAVOUR OF THE CHAMPION IN WHITE
1992-141719-0035 INCENS'D TO THE LAST DEGREE GOT UP AND DREW HIS SWORD ZADIG SPRANG FROM HIS HORSE WITH HIS SABRE IN HIS HAND NOW BEHOLD THE TWO CHIEFTAINS UPON THEIR LEGS COMMENCING A NEW TRIAL OF SKILL WHERE THEY SEEM'D TO GET THE BETTER OF EACH OTHER ALTERNATELY
1992-141719-0036 FOR BOTH WERE STRONG AND BOTH WERE ACTIVE THE FEATHERS OF THEIR HELMETS THE STUDS OF THEIR BRACELETS THEIR COATS OF MAIL FLEW ABOUT IN PIECES THRO THE DRY BLOWS WHICH THEY A THOUSAND TIMES REPEATED THEY STRUCK AT EACH OTHER SOMETIMES WITH THE EDGE OF THEIR SWORDS
1992-141719-0037 AT OTHER TIMES THEY PUSH'D AS OCCASION OFFER'D NOW ON THE RIGHT THEN ON THE LEFT NOW ON THE HEAD THEN AT THE BREAST THEY RETREATED THEY ADVANC'D THEY KEPT AT A DISTANCE THEY CLOS'D AGAIN
1992-141719-0038 THEIR SWORDS STRUCK FIRE ALMOST AT EVERY BLOW AT LAST ZADIG IN ORDER TO RECOVER HIS BREATH FOR A MOMENT OR TWO STOOD STILL AND AFTERWARDS MAKING A FEINT AT THE PRINCE THREW HIM ON HIS BACK AND DISARM'D HIM HOTTAM THEREUPON
1992-141719-0039 CRIED OUT O THOU KNIGHT OF THE WHITE ARMOUR TIS YOU ONLY ARE DESTIN'D TO BE THE KING OF BABYLON THE QUEEN WAS PERFECTLY TRANSPORTED THE TWO CHAMPIONS WERE RECONDUCTED TO THEIR SEPARATE LODGES AS THE OTHERS HAD BEEN BEFORE THEM IN CONFORMITY TO THE LAWS PRESCRIB'D
1992-141719-0040 SEVERAL MUTES WERE ORDER'D TO WAIT ON THE CHAMPIONS AND CARRY THEM SOME PROPER REFRESHMENT WE'LL LEAVE THE READER TO JUDGE WHETHER THE QUEEN'S DWARF WAS NOT APPOINTED TO WAIT ON ZADIG ON THIS HAPPY OCCASION AFTER SUPPER THE MUTES WITHDREW
1992-141719-0041 AND LEFT THE COMBATANTS TO REST THEIR WEARIED LIMBS TILL THE NEXT MORNING AT WHICH TIME THE VICTOR WAS TO PRODUCE HIS DEVICE BEFORE THE GRAND MAGUS IN ORDER TO CONFER NOTES AND DISCOVER THE HERO WHOEVER HE MIGHT BE ZADIG SLEPT VERY SOUND
1992-141719-0042 NOTWITHSTANDING HIS AMOROUS REGARD FOR THE QUEEN BEING PERFECTLY FATIGU'D ITABOD WHO LAY IN THE LODGE CONTIGUOUS TO HIS COULD NOT ONCE CLOSE HIS EYES FOR VEXATION HE GOT UP THEREFORE IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT STOLE IMPERCEPTIBLY INTO ZADIG'S APARTMENT
1992-141719-0043 TOOK HIS WHITE ARMOUR AND DEVICE AWAY WITH HIM AND SUBSTITUTED HIS GREEN ONE IN ITS PLACE AS SOON AS THE DAY BEGAN TO DAWN HE REPAIR'D WITH A SEEMINGLY UNDAUNTED COURAGE TO THE GRAND MAGUS TO INFORM HIM THAT HE WAS THE MIGHTY HERO THE HAPPY VICTOR
1992-141719-0044 AND WAS PROCLAIM'D VICTOR BEFORE ZADIG WAS AWAKE
1992-141719-0045 RETURN'D WITH A HEART OVERWHELM'D WITH DESPAIR TO THE COURT OF BABYLON
1992-141719-0046 HE WAS OBLIG'D THO SORELY AGAINST HIS WILL TO PUT IT ON HAVING NOTHING ELSE IN HIS LODGE TO APPEAR IN CONFOUNDED AND BIG WITH RESENTMENT
1992-141719-0047 THE POPULACE THAT WERE LEFT BEHIND IN THE CIRCUS HISS'D HIM EVERY STEP HE TOOK THEY MADE A RING ABOUT HIM AND TREATED HIM WITH ALL THE MARKS OF IGNOMINY AND CONTEMPT THE MOST COWARDLY WRETCH BREATHING WAS NEVER SURE SO SWEATED OR HUNTED DOWN AS POOR ZADIG
1992-141719-0048 HE GREW QUITE OUT OF PATIENCE AT LAST AND CUT HIS WAY THRO THE INSULTING MOB WITH HIS RIVAL'S SABRE BUT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT MEASURES TO PURSUE OR HOW TO RECTIFY SO GROSS A MISTAKE IT WAS NOT IN HIS POWER TO HAVE A SIGHT OF THE QUEEN
1992-141719-0049 HE COULD NEVER RECOVER THE WHITE ARMOUR AGAIN WHICH SHE HAD SENT HIM THAT WAS THE COMPROMISE OR THE ENGAGEMENT TO WHICH THE COMBATANTS HAD ALL UNANIMOUSLY AGREED THUS AS HE WAS ON THE ONE HAND PLUNG'D IN AN ABYSS OF SORROW
1992-141719-0050 SO ON THE OTHER HE WAS ALMOST DROVE DISTRACTED WITH VEXATION AND RESENTMENT HE WITHDREW THEREFORE IN A SOLITARY MOOD TO THE BANKS OF THE EUPHRATES NOW FULLY PERSUADED
1992-141719-0051 THAT HIS IMPROPITIOUS STAR HAD SHED ITS MOST BALEFUL INFLUENCE ON HIM AND THAT HIS MISFORTUNES WERE IRRETRIEVABLE REVOLVING IN HIS MIND ALL HIS DISAPPOINTMENTS FROM HIS FIRST ADVENTURE WITH THE COURT COQUET
1992-141719-0052 DOWN TO HIS LATE LOSS OF HIS WHITE ARMOUR SEE SAID HE THE FATAL CONSEQUENCE OF BEING A SLUGGARD
1992-141719-0053 ALL THE KNOWLEDGE OF BOOKS OR MANKIND ALL THE PERSONAL VALOUR THAT I CAN BOAST OF HAS ONLY PROV'D AN AGGRAVATION OF MY SORROWS HE CARRIED THE POINT SO FAR AT LAST AS TO MURMUR AT THE UNEQUAL DISPENSATIONS OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE
1992-141719-0054 AND WAS TEMPTED TO BELIEVE THAT ALL OCCURRENCES WERE GOVERN'D BY A MALIGNANT DESTINY WHICH NEVER FAIL'D TO OPPRESS THE VIRTUOUS AND ALWAYS CROWN'D THE ACTIONS OF SUCH VILLAINS AS THE GREEN KNIGHT WITH UNCOMMON SUCCESS IN ONE OF HIS FRANTICK FITS
1992-141719-0055 HE PUT ON THE GREEN ARMOUR THAT HAD CREATED HIM SUCH A WORLD OF DISGRACE A MERCHANT HAPPENING TO PASS BY HE SOLD IT TO HIM FOR A TRIFLE AND TOOK IN EXCHANGE NOTHING MORE THAN A MANTLE AND A CAP
200-124139-0000 TO THE CIVIL INQUIRIES WHICH THEN POURED IN AND AMONGST WHICH SHE HAD THE PLEASURE OF DISTINGUISHING THE MUCH SUPERIOR SOLICITUDE OF MISTER BINGLEY'S SHE COULD NOT MAKE A VERY FAVOURABLE ANSWER JANE WAS BY NO MEANS BETTER
200-124139-0001 THE SISTERS ON HEARING THIS REPEATED THREE OR FOUR TIMES HOW MUCH THEY WERE GRIEVED HOW SHOCKING IT WAS TO HAVE A BAD COLD AND HOW EXCESSIVELY THEY DISLIKED BEING ILL THEMSELVES AND THEN THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE MATTER
200-124139-0002 AND THEIR INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS JANE WHEN NOT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THEM RESTORED ELIZABETH TO THE ENJOYMENT OF ALL HER FORMER DISLIKE THEIR BROTHER INDEED WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHOM SHE COULD REGARD WITH ANY COMPLACENCY
200-124139-0003 MISS BINGLEY WAS ENGROSSED BY MISTER DARCY HER SISTER SCARCELY LESS SO AND AS FOR MISTER HURST BY WHOM ELIZABETH SAT HE WAS AN INDOLENT MAN
200-124139-0004 WHO WHEN HE FOUND HER TO PREFER A PLAIN DISH TO A RAGOUT HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO HER WHEN DINNER WAS OVER SHE RETURNED DIRECTLY TO JANE AND MISS BINGLEY BEGAN ABUSING HER AS SOON AS SHE WAS OUT OF THE ROOM
200-124139-0005 SHE HAS NOTHING IN SHORT TO RECOMMEND HER BUT BEING AN EXCELLENT WALKER I SHALL NEVER FORGET HER APPEARANCE THIS MORNING SHE REALLY LOOKED ALMOST WILD SHE DID INDEED LOUISA
200-124139-0006 SIX INCHES DEEP IN MUD I AM ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN AND THE GOWN WHICH HAD BEEN LET DOWN TO HIDE IT NOT DOING ITS OFFICE YOUR PICTURE MAY BE VERY EXACT LOUISA SAID BINGLEY BUT THIS WAS ALL LOST UPON ME
200-124139-0007 CERTAINLY NOT TO WALK THREE MILES OR FOUR MILES OR FIVE MILES
200-124139-0008 SAID BINGLEY I AM AFRAID MISTER DARCY OBSERVED MISS BINGLEY IN A HALF WHISPER THAT THIS ADVENTURE HAS RATHER AFFECTED YOUR ADMIRATION OF HER FINE EYES
200-124139-0009 HE REPLIED THEY WERE BRIGHTENED BY THE EXERCISE A SHORT PAUSE FOLLOWED THIS SPEECH AND MISSUS HURST BEGAN AGAIN I HAVE AN EXCESSIVE REGARD FOR MISS JANE BENNET SHE IS REALLY A VERY SWEET GIRL
200-124139-0010 AND I WISH WITH ALL MY HEART SHE WERE WELL SETTLED BUT WITH SUCH A FATHER AND MOTHER AND SUCH LOW CONNECTIONS I AM AFRAID THERE IS NO CHANCE OF IT
200-124139-0011 YES AND THEY HAVE ANOTHER WHO LIVES SOMEWHERE NEAR CHEAPSIDE THAT IS CAPITAL ADDED HER SISTER AND THEY BOTH LAUGHED HEARTILY
200-124139-0012 IT WOULD NOT MAKE THEM ONE JOT LESS AGREEABLE BUT IT MUST VERY MATERIALLY LESSEN THEIR CHANCE OF MARRYING MEN OF ANY CONSIDERATION IN THE WORLD REPLIED DARCY TO THIS SPEECH BINGLEY MADE NO ANSWER
200-124139-0013 BUT HIS SISTERS GAVE IT THEIR HEARTY ASSENT AND INDULGED THEIR MIRTH FOR SOME TIME AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR DEAR FRIEND'S VULGAR RELATIONS
200-124139-0014 AND SAT WITH HER TILL SUMMONED TO COFFEE SHE WAS STILL VERY POORLY AND ELIZABETH WOULD NOT QUIT HER AT ALL TILL LATE IN THE EVENING WHEN SHE HAD THE COMFORT OF SEEING HER SLEEP AND WHEN IT SEEMED TO HER RATHER RIGHT THAN PLEASANT
200-124139-0015 THAT SHE SHOULD GO DOWNSTAIRS HERSELF ON ENTERING THE DRAWING ROOM SHE FOUND THE WHOLE PARTY AT LOO AND WAS IMMEDIATELY INVITED TO JOIN THEM BUT SUSPECTING THEM TO BE PLAYING HIGH SHE DECLINED IT
200-124139-0016 AND MAKING HER SISTER THE EXCUSE SAID SHE WOULD AMUSE HERSELF FOR THE SHORT TIME SHE COULD STAY BELOW WITH A BOOK MISTER HURST LOOKED AT HER WITH ASTONISHMENT DO YOU PREFER READING TO CARDS SAID HE THAT IS RATHER SINGULAR
200-124139-0017 MISS ELIZA BENNET SAID MISS BINGLEY DESPISES CARDS SHE IS A GREAT READER AND HAS NO PLEASURE IN ANYTHING ELSE
200-124139-0018 HE IMMEDIATELY OFFERED TO FETCH HER OTHERS ALL THAT HIS LIBRARY AFFORDED AND I WISH MY COLLECTION WERE LARGER FOR YOUR BENEFIT AND MY OWN CREDIT BUT I AM AN IDLE FELLOW AND THOUGH I HAVE NOT MANY I HAVE MORE THAN I EVER LOOKED INTO
200-124139-0019 I AM ASTONISHED SAID MISS BINGLEY THAT MY FATHER SHOULD HAVE LEFT SO SMALL A COLLECTION OF BOOKS WHAT A DELIGHTFUL LIBRARY YOU HAVE AT PEMBERLEY MISTER DARCY IT OUGHT TO BE GOOD HE REPLIED
200-124139-0020 IT HAS BEEN THE WORK OF MANY GENERATIONS
200-124139-0021 CHARLES WHEN YOU BUILD YOUR HOUSE
200-124139-0022 I WISH IT MAY BUT I WOULD REALLY ADVISE YOU TO MAKE YOUR PURCHASE IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD AND TAKE PEMBERLEY FOR A KIND OF MODEL THERE IS NOT A FINER COUNTY IN ENGLAND THAN DERBYSHIRE WITH ALL MY HEART
200-124139-0023 I WILL BUY PEMBERLEY ITSELF IF DARCY WILL SELL IT I AM TALKING OF POSSIBILITIES CHARLES UPON MY WORD CAROLINE I SHOULD THINK IT MORE POSSIBLE TO GET PEMBERLEY BY PURCHASE THAN BY IMITATION
200-124139-0024 SAID MISS BINGLEY WILL SHE BE AS TALL AS I AM I THINK SHE WILL SHE IS NOW ABOUT MISS ELIZABETH BENNET'S HEIGHT OR RATHER TALLER HOW I LONG TO SEE HER AGAIN I NEVER MET
200-124139-0025 WITH ANYBODY WHO DELIGHTED ME SO MUCH SUCH A COUNTENANCE SUCH MANNERS AND SO EXTREMELY ACCOMPLISHED FOR HER AGE HER PERFORMANCE ON THE PIANOFORTE IS EXQUISITE IT IS AMAZING TO ME SAID BINGLEY
200-124139-0026 THE WORD IS APPLIED TO MANY A WOMAN WHO DESERVES IT NO OTHERWISE THAN BY NETTING A PURSE OR COVERING A SCREEN BUT I AM VERY FAR FROM AGREEING WITH YOU IN YOUR ESTIMATION OF LADIES IN GENERAL
200-124139-0027 I CANNOT BOAST OF KNOWING MORE THAN HALF A DOZEN IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE THAT ARE REALLY ACCOMPLISHED NOR I I AM SURE SAID MISS BINGLEY THEN
200-124139-0028 OBSERVED ELIZABETH YOU MUST COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN YOUR IDEA OF AN ACCOMPLISHED WOMAN YES I DO COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN IT
200-124139-0029 NO ONE CAN BE REALLY ESTEEMED ACCOMPLISHED WHO DOES NOT GREATLY SURPASS WHAT IS USUALLY MET WITH A WOMAN MUST HAVE A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC SINGING DRAWING DANCING AND THE MODERN LANGUAGES TO DESERVE THE WORD
200-124139-0030 ADDED DARCY AND TO ALL THIS SHE MUST YET ADD SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF HER MIND BY EXTENSIVE READING I AM NO LONGER SURPRISED AT YOUR KNOWING ONLY SIX ACCOMPLISHED WOMEN
200-124139-0031 ARE YOU SO SEVERE UPON YOUR OWN SEX AS TO DOUBT THE POSSIBILITY OF ALL THIS I NEVER SAW SUCH A WOMAN I NEVER SAW SUCH CAPACITY AND TASTE AND APPLICATION AND ELEGANCE AS YOU DESCRIBE UNITED
200-124139-0032 MISSUS HURST AND MISS BINGLEY BOTH CRIED OUT AGAINST THE INJUSTICE OF HER IMPLIED DOUBT AND WERE BOTH PROTESTING THAT THEY KNEW MANY WOMEN WHO ANSWERED THIS DESCRIPTION WHEN MISTER HURST CALLED THEM TO ORDER
200-124139-0033 WITH BITTER COMPLAINTS OF THEIR INATTENTION TO WHAT WAS GOING FORWARD AS ALL CONVERSATION WAS THEREBY AT AN END ELIZABETH SOON AFTERWARDS LEFT THE ROOM ELIZABETH BENNET SAID MISS BINGLEY WHEN THE DOOR WAS CLOSED ON HER
200-124139-0034 A VERY MEAN ART UNDOUBTEDLY REPLIED DARCY TO WHOM THIS REMARK WAS CHIEFLY ADDRESSED THERE IS A MEANNESS IN ALL THE ARTS WHICH LADIES SOMETIMES CONDESCEND TO EMPLOY FOR CAPTIVATION
200-124139-0035 WHATEVER BEARS AFFINITY TO CUNNING IS DESPICABLE MISS BINGLEY WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY SATISFIED WITH THIS REPLY AS TO CONTINUE THE SUBJECT
200-124139-0036 ELIZABETH JOINED THEM AGAIN ONLY TO SAY THAT HER SISTER WAS WORSE AND THAT SHE COULD NOT LEAVE HER BINGLEY URGED MISTER JONES BEING SENT FOR IMMEDIATELY WHILE HIS SISTERS CONVINCED THAT NO COUNTRY ADVICE COULD BE OF ANY SERVICE
200-124139-0037 RECOMMENDED AN EXPRESS TO TOWN FOR ONE OF THE MOST EMINENT PHYSICIANS THIS SHE WOULD NOT HEAR OF BUT SHE WAS NOT SO UNWILLING TO COMPLY WITH THEIR BROTHER'S PROPOSAL AND IT WAS SETTLED THAT MISTER JONES SHOULD BE SENT FOR EARLY IN THE MORNING
200-124139-0038 IF MISS BENNET WERE NOT DECIDEDLY BETTER BINGLEY WAS QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE HIS SISTERS DECLARED THAT THEY WERE MISERABLE THEY SOLACED THEIR WRETCHEDNESS HOWEVER BY DUETS AFTER SUPPER
200-124140-0000 AND SOME TIME AFTERWARDS FROM THE TWO ELEGANT LADIES WHO WAITED ON HIS SISTERS IN SPITE OF THIS AMENDMENT HOWEVER SHE REQUESTED TO HAVE A NOTE SENT TO LONGBOURN DESIRING HER MOTHER TO VISIT JANE AND FORM HER OWN JUDGEMENT OF HER SITUATION
200-124140-0001 THE NOTE WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED AND ITS CONTENTS AS QUICKLY COMPLIED WITH MISSUS BENNET ACCOMPANIED BY HER TWO YOUNGEST GIRLS REACHED NETHERFIELD SOON AFTER THE FAMILY BREAKFAST HAD SHE FOUND JANE IN ANY APPARENT DANGER
200-124140-0002 SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN THEREFORE TO HER DAUGHTER'S PROPOSAL OF BEING CARRIED HOME NEITHER DID THE APOTHECARY WHO ARRIVED ABOUT THE SAME TIME THINK IT AT ALL ADVISABLE AFTER SITTING A LITTLE WHILE WITH JANE
200-124140-0003 ON MISS BINGLEY'S APPEARANCE AND INVITATION THE MOTHER AND THREE DAUGHTERS ALL ATTENDED HER INTO THE BREAKFAST PARLOUR BINGLEY MET THEM WITH HOPES THAT MISSUS BENNET HAD NOT FOUND MISS BENNET WORSE THAN SHE EXPECTED
200-124140-0004 INDEED I HAVE SIR WAS HER ANSWER SHE IS A GREAT DEAL TOO ILL TO BE MOVED MISTER JONES SAYS WE MUST NOT THINK OF MOVING HER WE MUST TRESPASS A LITTLE LONGER ON YOUR KINDNESS
200-124140-0005 REMOVED CRIED BINGLEY IT MUST NOT BE THOUGHT OF MY SISTER I AM SURE WILL NOT HEAR OF HER REMOVAL YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT MADAM SAID MISS BINGLEY WITH COLD CIVILITY
200-124140-0006 YOU WILL NOT THINK OF QUITTING IT IN A HURRY I HOPE THOUGH YOU HAVE BUT A SHORT LEASE WHATEVER I DO IS DONE IN A HURRY REPLIED HE AND THEREFORE IF I SHOULD RESOLVE TO QUIT NETHERFIELD I SHOULD PROBABLY BE OFF IN FIVE MINUTES
200-124140-0007 AT PRESENT HOWEVER I CONSIDER MYSELF AS QUITE FIXED HERE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE SUPPOSED OF YOU SAID ELIZABETH YOU BEGIN TO COMPREHEND ME DO YOU CRIED HE TURNING TOWARDS HER
200-124140-0008 OH YES I UNDERSTAND YOU PERFECTLY I WISH I MIGHT TAKE THIS FOR A COMPLIMENT BUT TO BE SO EASILY SEEN THROUGH I AM AFRAID IS PITIFUL THAT IS AS IT HAPPENS
200-124140-0009 IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT A DEEP INTRICATE CHARACTER IS MORE OR LESS ESTIMABLE THAN SUCH A ONE AS YOURS LIZZY CRIED HER MOTHER REMEMBER WHERE YOU ARE AND DO NOT RUN ON IN THE WILD MANNER THAT YOU ARE SUFFERED TO DO AT HOME
200-124140-0010 I DID NOT KNOW BEFORE CONTINUED BINGLEY IMMEDIATELY THAT YOU WERE A STUDIER OF CHARACTER IT MUST BE AN AMUSING STUDY
200-124140-0011 THEY HAVE AT LEAST THAT ADVANTAGE THE COUNTRY SAID DARCY CAN IN GENERAL SUPPLY BUT A FEW SUBJECTS FOR SUCH A STUDY IN A COUNTRY NEIGHBOURHOOD YOU MOVE IN A VERY CONFINED AND UNVARYING SOCIETY
200-124140-0012 BUT PEOPLE THEMSELVES ALTER SO MUCH
200-124140-0013 OFFENDED BY HIS MANNER OF MENTIONING A COUNTRY NEIGHBOURHOOD I ASSURE YOU THERE IS QUITE AS MUCH OF THAT GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY AS IN TOWN EVERYBODY WAS SURPRISED AND DARCY AFTER LOOKING AT HER FOR A MOMENT
200-124140-0014 TURNED SILENTLY AWAY MISSUS BENNET WHO FANCIED SHE HAD GAINED A COMPLETE VICTORY OVER HIM CONTINUED HER TRIUMPH I CANNOT SEE THAT LONDON HAS ANY GREAT ADVANTAGE OVER THE COUNTRY FOR MY PART
200-124140-0015 THEY HAVE EACH THEIR ADVANTAGES AND I CAN BE EQUALLY HAPPY IN EITHER AYE THAT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT DISPOSITION BUT THAT GENTLEMAN LOOKING AT DARCY SEEMED TO THINK THE COUNTRY WAS NOTHING AT ALL
200-124140-0016 INDEED MAMMA YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID ELIZABETH BLUSHING FOR HER MOTHER YOU QUITE MISTOOK MISTER DARCY HE ONLY MEANT THAT THERE WAS NOT SUCH A VARIETY OF PEOPLE TO BE MET WITH IN THE COUNTRY AS IN THE TOWN
200-124140-0017 WHICH YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE TO BE TRUE CERTAINLY MY DEAR NOBODY SAID THERE WERE BUT AS TO NOT MEETING WITH MANY PEOPLE IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD I BELIEVE THERE ARE FEW NEIGHBOURHOODS LARGER I KNOW WE DINE WITH FOUR AND TWENTY FAMILIES
200-124140-0018 NOTHING BUT CONCERN FOR ELIZABETH COULD ENABLE BINGLEY TO KEEP HIS COUNTENANCE HIS SISTER WAS LESS DELICATE AND DIRECTED HER EYES TOWARDS MISTER DARCY WITH A VERY EXPRESSIVE SMILE
200-124140-0019 ELIZABETH FOR THE SAKE OF SAYING SOMETHING THAT MIGHT TURN HER MOTHER'S THOUGHTS NOW ASKED HER IF CHARLOTTE LUCAS HAD BEEN AT LONGBOURN SINCE HER COMING AWAY
200-124140-0020 SO MUCH THE MAN OF FASHION SO GENTEEL AND EASY HE HAS ALWAYS SOMETHING TO SAY TO EVERYBODY THAT IS MY IDEA OF GOOD BREEDING AND THOSE PERSONS WHO FANCY THEMSELVES VERY IMPORTANT
200-124140-0021 AND NEVER OPEN THEIR MOUTHS QUITE MISTAKE THE MATTER DID CHARLOTTE DINE WITH YOU NO SHE WOULD GO HOME I FANCY SHE WAS WANTED ABOUT THE MINCE PIES
200-124140-0022 FOR MY PART MISTER BINGLEY I ALWAYS KEEP SERVANTS THAT CAN DO THEIR OWN WORK MY DAUGHTERS ARE BROUGHT UP VERY DIFFERENTLY BUT EVERYBODY IS TO JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES AND THE LUCASES ARE A VERY GOOD SORT OF GIRLS I ASSURE YOU IT IS A PITY THEY ARE NOT HANDSOME
200-124140-0023 NOT THAT I THINK CHARLOTTE SO VERY PLAIN BUT THEN SHE IS OUR PARTICULAR FRIEND
200-124140-0024 I DO NOT TRUST MY OWN PARTIALITY WHEN SHE WAS ONLY FIFTEEN THERE WAS A MAN AT MY BROTHER GARDINER'S IN TOWN SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER THAT MY SISTER IN LAW WAS SURE HE WOULD MAKE HER AN OFFER BEFORE WE CAME AWAY
200-124140-0025 BUT HOWEVER HE DID NOT PERHAPS HE THOUGHT HER TOO YOUNG HOWEVER HE WROTE SOME VERSES ON HER AND VERY PRETTY THEY WERE AND SO ENDED HIS AFFECTION SAID ELIZABETH IMPATIENTLY
200-124140-0026 THERE HAS BEEN MANY A ONE I FANCY OVERCOME IN THE SAME WAY I WONDER WHO FIRST DISCOVERED THE EFFICACY OF POETRY IN DRIVING AWAY LOVE I HAVE BEEN USED TO CONSIDER POETRY AS THE FOOD OF LOVE SAID DARCY
200-124140-0027 OF A FINE STOUT HEALTHY LOVE IT MAY EVERYTHING NOURISHES WHAT IS STRONG ALREADY BUT IF IT BE ONLY A SLIGHT THIN SORT OF INCLINATION I AM CONVINCED THAT ONE GOOD SONNET WILL STARVE IT ENTIRELY AWAY
200-124140-0028 DARCY ONLY SMILED AND THE GENERAL PAUSE WHICH ENSUED MADE ELIZABETH TREMBLE LEST HER MOTHER SHOULD BE EXPOSING HERSELF AGAIN SHE LONGED TO SPEAK BUT COULD THINK OF NOTHING TO SAY
200-124140-0029 AND FORCED HIS YOUNGER SISTER TO BE CIVIL ALSO AND SAY WHAT THE OCCASION REQUIRED SHE PERFORMED HER PART INDEED WITHOUT MUCH GRACIOUSNESS BUT MISSUS BENNET WAS SATISFIED AND SOON AFTERWARDS ORDERED HER CARRIAGE UPON THIS SIGNAL
200-124140-0030 THE YOUNGEST OF HER DAUGHTERS PUT HERSELF FORWARD THE TWO GIRLS HAD BEEN WHISPERING TO EACH OTHER DURING THE WHOLE VISIT AND THE RESULT OF IT WAS THAT THE YOUNGEST SHOULD TAX MISTER BINGLEY WITH HAVING PROMISED ON HIS FIRST COMING INTO THE COUNTRY TO GIVE A BALL AT NETHERFIELD
200-124140-0031 LYDIA WAS A STOUT WELL GROWN GIRL OF FIFTEEN WITH A FINE COMPLEXION AND GOOD HUMOURED COUNTENANCE A FAVOURITE WITH HER MOTHER WHOSE AFFECTION HAD BROUGHT HER INTO PUBLIC AT AN EARLY AGE SHE HAD HIGH ANIMAL SPIRITS
200-124140-0032 AND A SORT OF NATURAL SELF CONSEQUENCE WHICH THE ATTENTION OF THE OFFICERS TO WHOM HER UNCLE'S GOOD DINNERS AND HER OWN EASY MANNERS RECOMMENDED HER HAD INCREASED INTO ASSURANCE
200-124140-0033 AND ABRUPTLY REMINDED HIM OF HIS PROMISE
200-124140-0034 HIS ANSWER TO THIS SUDDEN ATTACK WAS DELIGHTFUL TO THEIR MOTHER'S EAR I AM PERFECTLY READY I ASSURE YOU TO KEEP MY ENGAGEMENT AND WHEN YOUR SISTER IS RECOVERED YOU SHALL IF YOU PLEASE NAME THE VERY DAY OF THE BALL
200-124140-0035 BUT YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO BE DANCING WHEN SHE IS ILL LYDIA DECLARED HERSELF SATISFIED
200-124140-0036 AND BY THAT TIME MOST LIKELY CAPTAIN CARTER WOULD BE AT MERYTON AGAIN AND WHEN YOU HAVE GIVEN YOUR BALL SHE ADDED I SHALL INSIST ON THEIR GIVING ONE ALSO I SHALL TELL COLONEL FORSTER IT WILL BE QUITE A SHAME IF HE DOES NOT
200-124140-0037 MISSUS BENNET AND HER DAUGHTERS THEN DEPARTED AND ELIZABETH RETURNED INSTANTLY TO JANE LEAVING HER OWN AND HER RELATIONS BEHAVIOUR TO THE REMARKS OF THE TWO LADIES AND MISTER DARCY THE LATTER OF WHOM HOWEVER
200-124140-0038 COULD NOT BE PREVAILED ON TO JOIN IN THEIR CENSURE OF HER IN SPITE OF ALL MISS BINGLEY'S WITTICISMS ON
200-126784-0000 CHAPTER FIVE THROUGH SOLWAY SANDS THROUGH TAROSS MOSS BLINDFOLD HE KNEW THE PATHS TO CROSS BY WILY TURNS BY DESPERATE BOUNDS HAD BAFFLED PERCY'S BEST BLOODHOUNDS
200-126784-0001 IN ESKE OR LIDDEL FORDS WERE NONE BUT HE WOULD RIDE THEM ONE BY ONE ALIKE TO HIM WAS TIME OR TIDE DECEMBER'S SNOW OR JULY'S PRIDE ALIKE TO HIM WAS TIDE OR TIME MOONLESS MIDNIGHT OR MATIN PRIME
200-126784-0002 WALTER SCOTT ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE WHARTON FAMILY LAID THEIR HEADS ON THEIR PILLOWS THAT NIGHT WITH A FOREBODING OF SOME INTERRUPTION TO THEIR ORDINARY QUIET UNEASINESS KEPT THE SISTERS FROM ENJOYING THEIR USUAL REPOSE
200-126784-0003 AND THEY ROSE FROM THEIR BEDS ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING UNREFRESHED AND ALMOST WITHOUT HAVING CLOSED THEIR EYES ON TAKING AN EAGER AND HASTY SURVEY OF THE VALLEY FROM THE WINDOWS OF THEIR ROOM NOTHING HOWEVER BUT ITS USUAL SERENITY WAS TO BE SEEN
200-126784-0004 COMPOSE THE SEASON FOR ENJOYMENT IN THE OPEN AIR THEY HAVE THEIR STORMS BUT THEY ARE DISTINCT AND NOT OF LONG CONTINUANCE LEAVING A CLEAR ATMOSPHERE AND A CLOUDLESS SKY
200-126784-0005 THE SISTERS DESCENDED TO THE PARLOR WITH A RETURNING CONFIDENCE IN THEIR BROTHER'S SECURITY AND THEIR OWN HAPPINESS THE FAMILY WERE EARLY IN ASSEMBLING AROUND THE BREAKFAST TABLE AND MISS PEYTON WITH A LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE
200-126784-0006 HAD PLEASANTLY INSISTED THAT THE ABSENCE OF HER NEPHEW SHOULD IN NO MANNER INTERFERE WITH THE REGULAR HOURS SHE HAD ESTABLISHED CONSEQUENTLY THE PARTY WERE ALREADY SEATED WHEN THE CAPTAIN MADE HIS APPEARANCE
200-126784-0007 THOUGH THE UNTASTED COFFEE SUFFICIENTLY PROVED THAT BY NONE OF HIS RELATIVES WAS HIS ABSENCE DISREGARDED I THINK I DID MUCH BETTER HE CRIED TAKING A CHAIR BETWEEN HIS SISTERS AND RECEIVING THEIR OFFERED SALUTES
200-126784-0008 TURNING TO HIS YOUNGER AND EVIDENTLY FAVORITE SISTER AND TAPPING HER CHEEK DID YOU SEE BANNERS IN THE CLOUDS AND MISTAKE MISS PEYTON'S AEOLIAN HARP FOR REBELLIOUS MUSIC NAY HENRY REJOINED THE MAID
200-126784-0009 LOOKING AT HIM AFFECTIONATELY MUCH AS I LOVE MY OWN COUNTRY THE APPROACH OF HER TROOPS JUST NOW WOULD GIVE ME GREAT PAIN THE BROTHER MADE NO REPLY BUT RETURNING THE FONDNESS EXPRESSED IN HER EYE BY A LOOK OF FRATERNAL TENDERNESS
200-126784-0010 HE GENTLY PRESSED HER HAND IN SILENCE WHEN CAESAR WHO HAD PARTICIPATED LARGELY IN THE ANXIETY OF THE FAMILY AND WHO HAD RISEN WITH THE DAWN AND KEPT A VIGILANT WATCH ON THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS AS HE STOOD GAZING FROM ONE OF THE WINDOWS
200-126784-0011 RUN MASSA HARRY RUN
200-126784-0012 RUN REPEATED THE BRITISH OFFICER GATHERING HIMSELF UP IN MILITARY PRIDE NO MISTER CAESAR RUNNING IS NOT MY TRADE WHILE SPEAKING HE WALKED DELIBERATELY TO THE WINDOW
200-126784-0013 WHERE THE FAMILY WERE ALREADY COLLECTED IN THE GREATEST CONSTERNATION
200-126784-0014 HIS HOUSE WAS SURROUNDED BY A DOZEN SENTINELS TWO OR THREE OF THE DRAGOONS NOW DISMOUNTED AND DISAPPEARED IN A FEW MINUTES HOWEVER THEY RETURNED TO THE YARD FOLLOWED BY KATY FROM WHOSE
200-126784-0015 VIOLENT GESTICULATIONS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MATTERS OF NO TRIFLING CONCERN WERE ON THE CARPET A SHORT COMMUNICATION WITH THE LOQUACIOUS HOUSEKEEPER FOLLOWED THE ARRIVAL OF THE MAIN BODY OF THE TROOP AND THE ADVANCE PARTY REMOUNTING
200-126784-0016 BUT THEY WERE ALL HAUGHTILY REJECTED BY THE YOUNG MAN AS UNWORTHY OF HIS CHARACTER IT WAS TOO LATE TO RETREAT TO THE WOODS IN THE REAR OF THE COTTAGE FOR HE WOULD UNAVOIDABLY BE SEEN AND FOLLOWED BY A TROOP OF HORSE AS INEVITABLY TAKEN
200-126784-0017 AT LENGTH HIS SISTERS WITH TREMBLING HANDS REPLACED HIS ORIGINAL DISGUISE THE INSTRUMENTS OF WHICH HAD BEEN CAREFULLY KEPT AT HAND BY CAESAR IN EXPECTATION OF SOME SUDDEN EMERGENCY
200-126784-0018 THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS HASTILY AND IMPERFECTLY COMPLETED AS THE DRAGOONS ENTERED THE LAWN AND ORCHARD OF THE LOCUSTS RIDING WITH THE RAPIDITY OF THE WIND AND IN THEIR TURN THE WHARTONS WERE SURROUNDED
200-126784-0019 NOTHING REMAINED NOW BUT TO MEET THE IMPENDING EXAMINATION WITH AS MUCH INDIFFERENCE AS THE FAMILY COULD ASSUME THE LEADER OF THE HORSE DISMOUNTED AND FOLLOWED BY A COUPLE OF HIS MEN HE APPROACHED THE OUTER DOOR OF THE BUILDING
200-126784-0020 WHICH WAS SLOWLY AND RELUCTANTLY OPENED FOR HIS ADMISSION BY CAESAR THE HEAVY TREAD OF THE TROOPER AS HE FOLLOWED THE BLACK TO THE DOOR OF THE PARLOR RANG IN THE EARS OF THE FEMALES AS IT APPROACHED NEARER AND NEARER
200-126784-0021 AND DROVE THE BLOOD FROM THEIR FACES TO THEIR HEARTS WITH A CHILL THAT NEARLY ANNIHILATED FEELING A MAN WHOSE COLOSSAL STATURE MANIFESTED THE POSSESSION OF VAST STRENGTH ENTERED THE ROOM AND REMOVING HIS CAP
200-126784-0022 HIS APPEARANCE DID NOT INDICATE AS BELONGING TO HIS NATURE HIS DARK HAIR HUNG AROUND HIS BROW IN PROFUSION THOUGH STAINED WITH POWDER WHICH WAS WORN AT THAT DAY AND HIS FACE WAS NEARLY HID IN THE WHISKERS BY WHICH IT WAS DISFIGURED
200-126784-0023 STILL THE EXPRESSION OF HIS EYE THOUGH PIERCING WAS NOT BAD AND HIS VOICE THOUGH DEEP AND POWERFUL WAS FAR FROM UNPLEASANT FRANCES VENTURED TO THROW A TIMID GLANCE AT HIS FIGURE AS HE ENTERED
200-126784-0024 AND SAW AT ONCE THE MAN FROM WHOSE SCRUTINY HARVEY BIRCH HAD WARNED THEM THERE WAS SO MUCH TO BE APPREHENDED YOU HAVE NO CAUSE FOR ALARM LADIES SAID THE OFFICER PAUSING A MOMENT AND CONTEMPLATING THE PALE FACES AROUND HIM
200-126784-0025 MY BUSINESS WILL BE CONFINED TO A FEW QUESTIONS WHICH IF FREELY ANSWERED WILL INSTANTLY REMOVE US FROM YOUR DWELLING AND WHAT MAY THEY BE SIR STAMMERED MISTER WHARTON
200-126784-0026 RISING FROM HIS CHAIR AND WAITING ANXIOUSLY FOR THE REPLY HAS THERE BEEN A STRANGE GENTLEMAN STAYING WITH YOU DURING THE STORM CONTINUED THE DRAGOON SPEAKING WITH INTEREST AND IN SOME DEGREE SHARING IN THE EVIDENT ANXIETY OF THE FATHER
200-126784-0027 AND HAS NOT YET DEPARTED THIS GENTLEMAN REPEATED THE OTHER TURNING TO CAPTAIN WHARTON AND CONTEMPLATING HIS FIGURE FOR A MOMENT
200-126784-0028 HE APPROACHED THE YOUTH WITH AN AIR OF COMIC GRAVITY AND WITH A LOW BOW CONTINUED I AM SORRY FOR THE SEVERE COLD YOU HAVE IN YOUR HEAD SIR I EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN IN SURPRISE
200-126784-0029 I HAVE NO COLD IN MY HEAD I FANCIED IT THEN FROM SEEING YOU HAD COVERED SUCH HANDSOME BLACK LOCKS WITH THAT UGLY OLD WIG IT WAS MY MISTAKE YOU WILL PLEASE TO PARDON IT
200-126784-0030 MISTER WHARTON GROANED ALOUD BUT THE LADIES IGNORANT OF THE EXTENT OF THEIR VISITOR'S KNOWLEDGE REMAINED IN TREMBLING YET RIGID SILENCE THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF MOVED HIS HAND INVOLUNTARILY TO HIS HEAD
200-126784-0031 AND DISCOVERED THAT THE TREPIDATION OF HIS SISTERS HAD LEFT SOME OF HIS NATURAL HAIR EXPOSED THE DRAGOON WATCHED THE MOVEMENT WITH A CONTINUED SMILE WHEN SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HIMSELF TURNING TO THE FATHER HE PROCEEDED
200-126784-0032 MISTER HARPER ECHOED THE OTHER FEELING A LOAD REMOVED FROM HIS HEART YES I HAD FORGOTTEN BUT HE IS GONE AND IF THERE BE ANYTHING WRONG IN HIS CHARACTER WE ARE IN ENTIRE IGNORANCE OF IT
200-126784-0033 TO ME HE WAS A TOTAL STRANGER YOU HAVE BUT LITTLE TO APPREHEND FROM HIS CHARACTER ANSWERED THE DRAGOON DRYLY BUT HE IS GONE HOW WHEN AND WHITHER
200-126784-0034 HIS COUNTENANCE GRADUALLY LIGHTING INTO A SMILE OF PLEASURE
200-126784-0035 HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND LEFT THE APARTMENT THE WHARTONS JUDGING FROM HIS MANNER THOUGHT HE WAS ABOUT TO PROCEED IN QUEST OF THE OBJECT OF HIS INQUIRIES THEY OBSERVED THE DRAGOON ON
200-126784-0036 GAINING THE LAWN IN EARNEST AND APPARENTLY PLEASED CONVERSATION WITH HIS TWO SUBALTERNS IN A FEW MOMENTS ORDERS WERE GIVEN TO SOME OF THE TROOPS AND HORSEMEN LEFT THE VALLEY AT FULL SPEED BY ITS VARIOUS ROADS
200-126784-0037 THE SUSPENSE OF THE PARTY WITHIN WHO WERE ALL HIGHLY INTERESTED WITNESSES OF THIS SCENE
2002-139469-0000 SOME DISORDER HAD SURELY CREPT INTO THE COURSE OF THE ELEMENTS DESTROYING THEIR BENIGNANT INFLUENCE THE WIND PRINCE OF AIR RAGED THROUGH HIS KINGDOM LASHING THE SEA INTO FURY
2002-139469-0001 AND SUBDUING THE REBEL EARTH INTO SOME SORT OF OBEDIENCE THE GOD SENDS DOWN HIS ANGRY PLAGUES FROM HIGH FAMINE AND PESTILENCE IN HEAPS THEY DIE AGAIN IN VENGEANCE OF HIS WRATH HE FALLS
2002-139469-0002 ON THEIR GREAT HOSTS AND BREAKS THEIR TOTTERING WALLS ARRESTS THEIR NAVIES ON THE OCEAN'S PLAIN AND WHELMS THEIR STRENGTH WITH MOUNTAINS OF THE MAIN
2002-139469-0003 THEIR DEADLY POWER SHOOK THE FLOURISHING COUNTRIES OF THE SOUTH AND DURING WINTER EVEN WE IN OUR NORTHERN RETREAT BEGAN TO QUAKE UNDER THEIR ILL EFFECTS
2002-139469-0004 THAT FABLE IS UNJUST WHICH GIVES THE SUPERIORITY TO THE SUN OVER THE WIND WHO HAS NOT SEEN THE LIGHTSOME EARTH THE BALMY ATMOSPHERE AND BASKING NATURE BECOME DARK COLD
2002-139469-0005 AND UNGENIAL WHEN THE SLEEPING WIND HAS AWOKE IN THE EAST OR WHEN THE DUN CLOUDS THICKLY VEIL THE SKY
2002-139469-0006 UNTIL THE DANK EARTH REFUSING TO IMBIBE THE SUPERABUNDANT MOISTURE IT LIES IN POOLS ON THE SURFACE WHEN THE TORCH OF DAY SEEMS LIKE A METEOR TO BE QUENCHED
2002-139469-0007 WHO HAS NOT SEEN THE CLOUD STIRRING NORTH ARISE THE STREAKED BLUE APPEAR AND SOON AN OPENING MADE IN THE VAPOURS IN THE EYE OF THE WIND THROUGH WHICH THE BRIGHT AZURE SHINES
2002-139469-0008 THE CLOUDS BECOME THIN AN ARCH IS FORMED FOR EVER RISING UPWARDS TILL THE UNIVERSAL COPE BEING UNVEILED THE SUN POURS FORTH ITS RAYS RE ANIMATED AND FED BY THE BREEZE
2002-139469-0009 THEN MIGHTY ART THOU O WIND TO BE THRONED ABOVE ALL
2002-139469-0010 WHETHER THOU COMEST DESTROYING FROM THE EAST OR PREGNANT WITH ELEMENTARY LIFE FROM THE WEST THEE THE CLOUDS OBEY THE SUN IS SUBSERVIENT TO THEE THE SHORELESS
2002-139469-0011 OCEAN IS THY SLAVE THOU SWEEPEST OVER THE EARTH AND OAKS THE GROWTH OF CENTURIES SUBMIT TO THY VIEWLESS AXE THE SNOW DRIFT IS SCATTERED ON THE PINNACLES OF THE ALPS
2002-139469-0012 THE AVALANCHE THUNDERS DOWN THEIR VALLIES THOU HOLDEST THE KEYS OF THE FROST AND CANST FIRST CHAIN AND THEN SET FREE THE STREAMS UNDER THY GENTLE GOVERNANCE THE BUDS AND LEAVES ARE BORN
2002-139469-0013 THEY FLOURISH NURSED BY THEE WHY DOST THOU HOWL THUS O WIND BY DAY AND BY NIGHT FOR FOUR LONG MONTHS THY ROARINGS HAVE NOT CEASED THE SHORES OF THE SEA ARE STREWN WITH WRECKS
2002-139469-0014 THE EARTH HAS SHED HER BEAUTY IN OBEDIENCE TO THY COMMAND THE FRAIL BALLOON DARES NO LONGER SAIL ON THE AGITATED AIR THY MINISTERS THE CLOUDS DELUGE THE LAND WITH RAIN
2002-139469-0015 RIVERS FORSAKE THEIR BANKS THE WILD TORRENT TEARS UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH PLAIN AND WOOD AND VERDANT DELL ARE DESPOILED OF THEIR LOVELINESS
2002-139469-0016 OUR VERY CITIES ARE WASTED BY THEE ALAS WHAT WILL BECOME OF US IT SEEMS AS IF THE GIANT WAVES OF OCEAN AND VAST ARMS OF THE SEA WERE ABOUT TO WRENCH THE DEEP ROOTED ISLAND FROM ITS CENTRE AND CAST IT
2002-139469-0017 A RUIN AND A WRECK UPON THE FIELDS OF THE ATLANTIC WHAT ARE WE THE INHABITANTS OF THIS GLOBE LEAST AMONG THE MANY THAT PEOPLE INFINITE SPACE OUR MINDS EMBRACE INFINITY
2002-139469-0018 OF OUR BEING IS SUBJECT TO MEREST ACCIDENT DAY BY DAY WE ARE FORCED TO BELIEVE THIS HE WHOM A SCRATCH HAS DISORGANIZED HE WHO DISAPPEARS FROM APPARENT LIFE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE HOSTILE AGENCY AT WORK AROUND US
2002-139469-0019 HAD THE SAME POWERS AS I I
2002-139469-0020 IN THE FACE OF ALL THIS WE CALL OURSELVES LORDS OF THE CREATION WIELDERS OF THE ELEMENTS MASTERS OF LIFE AND DEATH AND WE ALLEGE IN EXCUSE OF THIS ARROGANCE THAT THOUGH THE INDIVIDUAL IS DESTROYED
2002-139469-0021 MAN CONTINUES FOR EVER THUS LOSING OUR IDENTITY THAT OF WHICH WE ARE CHIEFLY CONSCIOUS WE GLORY IN THE CONTINUITY OF OUR SPECIES AND LEARN TO REGARD DEATH WITHOUT TERROR
2002-139469-0022 BUT WHEN ANY WHOLE NATION BECOMES THE VICTIM OF THE DESTRUCTIVE POWERS OF EXTERIOR AGENTS THEN INDEED MAN SHRINKS INTO INSIGNIFICANCE HE FEELS HIS TENURE OF LIFE INSECURE
2002-139469-0023 HIS INHERITANCE ON EARTH CUT OFF I REMEMBER AFTER HAVING WITNESSED THE DESTRUCTIVE EFFECTS OF A FIRE I COULD NOT EVEN BEHOLD A SMALL ONE IN A STOVE WITHOUT A SENSATION OF FEAR
2002-139469-0024 THE MOUNTING FLAMES HAD CURLED ROUND THE BUILDING AS IT FELL AND WAS DESTROYED THEY INSINUATED THEMSELVES INTO THE SUBSTANCES ABOUT THEM
2002-139469-0025 AND THE IMPEDIMENTS TO THEIR PROGRESS YIELDED AT THEIR TOUCH COULD WE TAKE INTEGRAL PARTS OF THIS POWER AND NOT BE SUBJECT TO ITS OPERATION COULD WE DOMESTICATE A CUB OF THIS WILD BEAST
2002-139469-0026 AND NOT FEAR ITS GROWTH AND MATURITY THUS WE BEGAN TO FEEL WITH REGARD TO MANY VISAGED DEATH LET LOOSE ON THE CHOSEN DISTRICTS OF OUR FAIR HABITATION
2002-139469-0027 AND ABOVE ALL WITH REGARD TO THE PLAGUE WE FEARED THE COMING SUMMER NATIONS BORDERING ON THE ALREADY INFECTED COUNTRIES BEGAN TO ENTER UPON SERIOUS PLANS FOR THE BETTER KEEPING OUT OF THE ENEMY
2002-139469-0028 WE A COMMERCIAL PEOPLE WERE OBLIGED TO BRING SUCH SCHEMES UNDER CONSIDERATION AND THE QUESTION OF CONTAGION BECAME MATTER OF EARNEST DISQUISITION
2002-139469-0029 THAT THE PLAGUE WAS NOT WHAT IS COMMONLY CALLED CONTAGIOUS LIKE THE SCARLET FEVER OR EXTINCT SMALL POX WAS PROVED IT WAS CALLED AN EPIDEMIC BUT THE GRAND QUESTION
2002-139469-0030 WAS STILL UNSETTLED OF HOW THIS EPIDEMIC WAS GENERATED AND INCREASED IF INFECTION DEPENDED UPON THE AIR THE AIR WAS SUBJECT TO INFECTION
2002-139469-0031 HAS BEEN BROUGHT BY SHIPS TO ONE SEA PORT TOWN YET THE VERY PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT IT THERE WERE INCAPABLE OF COMMUNICATING IT IN A TOWN MORE FORTUNATELY SITUATED BUT HOW ARE WE TO JUDGE OF AIRS
2002-139469-0032 AND PRONOUNCE IN SUCH A CITY PLAGUE WILL DIE UNPRODUCTIVE IN SUCH ANOTHER NATURE HAS PROVIDED FOR IT A PLENTIFUL HARVEST
2002-139469-0033 IN THE SAME WAY INDIVIDUALS MAY ESCAPE NINETY NINE TIMES AND RECEIVE THE DEATH BLOW AT THE HUNDREDTH BECAUSE BODIES ARE SOMETIMES
2002-139469-0034 THESE REFLECTIONS MADE OUR LEGISLATORS PAUSE BEFORE THEY COULD DECIDE ON THE LAWS TO BE PUT IN FORCE THE EVIL WAS SO WIDE SPREADING SO VIOLENT AND IMMEDICABLE THAT NO CARE NO PREVENTION COULD BE JUDGED SUPERFLUOUS
2002-139469-0035 WHICH EVEN ADDED A CHANCE TO OUR ESCAPE THESE WERE QUESTIONS OF PRUDENCE THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE NECESSITY FOR AN EARNEST CAUTION ENGLAND WAS STILL SECURE FRANCE
2002-139469-0036 GERMANY ITALY AND SPAIN WERE INTERPOSED WALLS YET WITHOUT A BREACH BETWEEN US AND THE PLAGUE OUR VESSELS TRULY WERE THE SPORT OF WINDS AND WAVES EVEN AS GULLIVER
2002-139469-0037 BROBDIGNAGIANS BUT WE ON OUR STABLE ABODE COULD NOT BE HURT IN LIFE OR LIMB BY THESE ERUPTIONS OF NATURE WE COULD NOT FEAR WE DID NOT YET A FEELING OF AWE
2002-139469-0038 A BREATHLESS SENTIMENT OF WONDER A PAINFUL SENSE
2002-139469-0039 DEGRADATION OF HUMANITY WAS INTRODUCED INTO EVERY HEART NATURE OUR MOTHER AND OUR FRIEND HAD TURNED ON US A BROW OF MENACE SHE SHEWED US PLAINLY THAT THOUGH SHE PERMITTED US TO ASSIGN HER LAWS AND SUBDUE HER APPARENT POWERS
2002-139469-0040 WE MUST QUAKE SHE COULD TAKE OUR GLOBE
2002-139469-0041 AND ALL THAT MAN'S MIND COULD INVENT OR HIS FORCE ACHIEVE SHE COULD TAKE THE BALL IN HER HAND AND CAST IT INTO SPACE WHERE LIFE WOULD BE DRUNK UP AND MAN AND ALL HIS EFFORTS FOR EVER ANNIHILATED
2002-139469-0042 THESE SPECULATIONS WERE RIFE AMONG US YET NOT THE LESS WE PROCEEDED IN OUR DAILY OCCUPATIONS AND OUR PLANS WHOSE ACCOMPLISHMENT DEMANDED THE LAPSE OF MANY YEARS NO VOICE WAS HEARD TELLING US TO HOLD
2002-139469-0043 WHEN FOREIGN DISTRESSES CAME TO BE FELT BY US THROUGH THE CHANNELS OF COMMERCE WE SET OURSELVES TO APPLY REMEDIES SUBSCRIPTIONS WERE MADE FOR THE EMIGRANTS AND MERCHANTS BANKRUPT BY THE FAILURE OF TRADE
2002-139469-0044 THE ENGLISH SPIRIT AWOKE TO ITS FULL ACTIVITY AND AS IT HAD EVER DONE SET ITSELF TO RESIST THE EVIL AND TO STAND IN THE BREACH WHICH DISEASED NATURE HAD SUFFERED CHAOS AND DEATH TO MAKE
2002-139469-0045 IN THE BOUNDS AND BANKS WHICH HAD HITHERTO KEPT THEM OUT AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF SUMMER WE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT THE MISCHIEF WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE IN DISTANT COUNTRIES WAS GREATER THAN WE HAD AT FIRST SUSPECTED
2002-139469-0046 QUITO WAS DESTROYED BY AN EARTHQUAKE MEXICO LAID WASTE BY THE UNITED EFFECTS OF STORM PESTILENCE AND FAMINE CROWDS OF EMIGRANTS INUNDATED THE WEST OF EUROPE
2002-139469-0047 AND OUR ISLAND HAD BECOME THE REFUGE OF THOUSANDS IN THE MEAN TIME
2002-139469-0048 HE HAD SOUGHT THIS OFFICE WITH EAGERNESS UNDER THE IDEA OF TURNING HIS WHOLE FORCES TO THE SUPPRESSION OF THE PRIVILEGED ORDERS OF OUR COMMUNITY
2002-139469-0049 AT LENGTH FORBADE A RECOURSE TO THE USUAL MODES OF RELIEF TRADE WAS STOPPED BY THE FAILURE OF THE INTERCHANGE OF CARGOES USUAL BETWEEN US AND AMERICA INDIA EGYPT AND GREECE
2002-139469-0050 IN VAIN OUR PROTECTOR AND HIS PARTIZANS SOUGHT TO CONCEAL THIS TRUTH IN VAIN DAY AFTER DAY HE APPOINTED A PERIOD FOR THE DISCUSSION OF THE NEW LAWS CONCERNING HEREDITARY RANK AND PRIVILEGE
2002-139469-0051 IN VAIN HE ENDEAVOURED TO REPRESENT THE EVIL AS PARTIAL AND TEMPORARY THESE DISASTERS CAME HOME TO SO MANY BOSOMS AND THROUGH THE VARIOUS CHANNELS OF COMMERCE WERE CARRIED SO
2002-139469-0052 ENTIRELY INTO EVERY CLASS AND DIVISION OF THE COMMUNITY THAT OF NECESSITY THEY BECAME THE FIRST QUESTION IN THE STATE THE CHIEF SUBJECTS TO WHICH WE MUST TURN OUR ATTENTION
2002-139469-0053 CAN IT BE TRUE EACH ASKED THE OTHER WITH WONDER AND DISMAY THAT WHOLE COUNTRIES ARE LAID WASTE WHOLE NATIONS ANNIHILATED BY THESE DISORDERS IN NATURE THE VAST CITIES OF AMERICA THE FERTILE PLAINS OF
2002-139469-0054 HINDOSTAN THE CROWDED ABODES OF THE CHINESE ARE MENACED WITH UTTER RUIN WHERE LATE THE BUSY MULTITUDES ASSEMBLED FOR PLEASURE OR PROFIT
2002-139469-0055 NOW ONLY THE SOUND OF WAILING AND MISERY IS HEARD THE AIR IS EMPOISONED AND EACH HUMAN BEING INHALES DEATH EVEN WHILE IN YOUTH AND HEALTH THEIR HOPES ARE IN THE FLOWER
2002-139469-0056 WE CALLED TO MIND THE PLAGUE OF THIRTEEN FORTY EIGHT WHEN IT WAS CALCULATED THAT A THIRD OF MANKIND HAD BEEN DESTROYED AS YET WESTERN EUROPE WAS UNINFECTED WOULD IT ALWAYS BE SO
2002-139469-0057 O YES IT WOULD COUNTRYMEN FEAR NOT IN THE STILL UNCULTIVATED WILDS OF AMERICA WHAT WONDER THAT AMONG ITS OTHER GIANT DESTROYERS PLAGUE SHOULD BE NUMBERED
2002-139469-0058 IT WOULD EXPIRE IN THESE CLIMES IT DRINKS THE DARK BLOOD OF THE INHABITANT OF THE SOUTH BUT IT NEVER FEASTS ON THE PALE FACED CELT IF
2002-139469-0059 PERCHANCE SOME STRICKEN ASIATIC
2002-139469-0060 PLAGUE DIES WITH HIM UNCOMMUNICATED AND INNOXIOUS LET US WEEP FOR OUR BRETHREN THOUGH WE CAN NEVER EXPERIENCE THEIR REVERSE
2002-139469-0061 LET US LAMENT OVER AND ASSIST THE CHILDREN OF THE GARDEN OF THE EARTH LATE WE ENVIED THEIR ABODES THEIR SPICY GROVES FERTILE PLAINS AND ABUNDANT LOVELINESS BUT IN THIS MORTAL LIFE EXTREMES ARE ALWAYS MATCHED
2002-139469-0062 THE THORN GROWS WITH THE ROSE THE POISON TREE AND THE CINNAMON MINGLE THEIR BOUGHS
2002-139469-0063 MARBLE HALLS AND INFINITE WEALTH IS NOW A TOMB THE TENT OF THE ARAB IS FALLEN IN THE SANDS AND HIS HORSE SPURNS THE GROUND UNBRIDLED AND UNSADDLED THE VOICE OF LAMENTATION FILLS THE VALLEY OF CASHMERE
2002-139469-0064 ITS DELLS AND WOODS ITS COOL FOUNTAINS AND GARDENS OF ROSES ARE POLLUTED BY THE DEAD IN CIRCASSIA AND GEORGIA THE SPIRIT OF BEAUTY WEEPS OVER THE RUIN OF ITS FAVOURITE TEMPLE THE FORM OF WOMAN
2002-139469-0065 OUR OWN DISTRESSES THOUGH THEY WERE OCCASIONED BY THE FICTITIOUS RECIPROCITY OF COMMERCE ENCREASED IN DUE PROPORTION BANKERS MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS
2002-139469-0066 WHOSE TRADE DEPENDED ON EXPORTS AND INTERCHANGE OF WEALTH BECAME BANKRUPT SUCH THINGS WHEN THEY HAPPEN SINGLY AFFECT ONLY THE IMMEDIATE PARTIES BUT THE PROSPERITY OF THE NATION WAS NOW SHAKEN BY FREQUENT AND EXTENSIVE LOSSES
2002-139469-0067 FAMILIES BRED IN OPULENCE AND LUXURY WERE REDUCED TO BEGGARY THE VERY STATE OF PEACE IN WHICH WE GLORIED WAS INJURIOUS THERE WERE NO MEANS OF EMPLOYING THE IDLE
2002-139469-0068 EVEN THE SOURCE OF COLONIES WAS DRIED UP FOR IN NEW HOLLAND
2002-139469-0069 AND THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE PLAGUE RAGED
2002-139469-0070 AND BRING BACK THE EARTH TO ITS ACCUSTOMED HEALTH
2002-139469-0071 AT THE MULTITUDE OF EVILS THAT GATHERED ROUND US MUST HE TAX THE LANDED INTEREST TO ASSIST OUR COMMERCIAL POPULATION TO DO THIS HE MUST GAIN THE FAVOUR OF THE CHIEF LAND HOLDERS THE NOBILITY OF THE COUNTRY
2002-139469-0072 AND THESE WERE HIS VOWED ENEMIES HE MUST CONCILIATE THEM BY ABANDONING HIS FAVOURITE SCHEME OF EQUALIZATION HE MUST CONFIRM THEM
2002-139469-0073 HE MUST SELL HIS CHERISHED PLANS FOR THE PERMANENT GOOD OF HIS COUNTRY FOR TEMPORARY RELIEF HE MUST AIM NO MORE AT THE DEAR OBJECT OF HIS AMBITION
2002-139469-0074 THROWING HIS ARMS ASIDE HE MUST FOR PRESENT ENDS GIVE UP THE ULTIMATE OBJECT OF HIS ENDEAVOURS HE CAME TO WINDSOR TO CONSULT WITH US EVERY DAY ADDED TO HIS DIFFICULTIES
2002-139469-0075 THE ARRIVAL OF FRESH VESSELS WITH EMIGRANTS THE TOTAL CESSATION OF COMMERCE THE STARVING MULTITUDE THAT THRONGED AROUND THE PALACE OF THE PROTECTORATE WERE CIRCUMSTANCES NOT TO BE TAMPERED WITH
2002-139469-0076 THE BLOW WAS STRUCK THE ARISTOCRACY OBTAINED ALL THEY WISHED AND THEY SUBSCRIBED TO A TWELVEMONTHS BILL WHICH LEVIED TWENTY PER CENT ON ALL THE RENT ROLLS OF THE COUNTRY
2002-139469-0077 CALM WAS NOW RESTORED TO THE METROPOLIS AND TO THE POPULOUS CITIES BEFORE DRIVEN TO DESPERATION AND WE RETURNED TO THE CONSIDERATION OF DISTANT CALAMITIES WONDERING IF THE FUTURE WOULD BRING ANY ALLEVIATION
2002-139469-0078 TO THEIR EXCESS IT WAS AUGUST SO THERE COULD BE SMALL HOPE OF RELIEF DURING THE HEATS ON THE CONTRARY
2002-139469-0079 WHILE STARVATION DID ITS ACCUSTOMED WORK THOUSANDS DIED UNLAMENTED FOR BESIDE THE YET WARM CORPSE THE MOURNER WAS STRETCHED MADE MUTE BY DEATH
2002-139469-0080 ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF THIS MONTH NEWS ARRIVED IN LONDON THAT THE PLAGUE WAS IN FRANCE AND ITALY THESE TIDINGS WERE AT FIRST WHISPERED ABOUT TOWN BUT NO ONE DARED EXPRESS ALOUD THE SOUL QUAILING INTELLIGENCE
2002-139469-0081 WHEN ANY ONE MET A FRIEND IN THE STREET HE ONLY CRIED AS HE HURRIED ON YOU KNOW WHILE THE OTHER WITH AN EJACULATION OF FEAR AND HORROR WOULD ANSWER
2002-139469-0082 WHAT WILL BECOME OF US AT LENGTH IT WAS MENTIONED IN THE NEWSPAPERS THE PARAGRAPH WAS INSERTED IN AN OBSCURE PART WE REGRET TO STATE
2002-139469-0083 THAT THERE CAN BE NO LONGER A DOUBT OF THE PLAGUE HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED AT LEGHORN GENOA AND MARSEILLES NO WORD OF COMMENT FOLLOWED
2002-139469-0084 WE WERE AS A MAN WHO HEARS THAT HIS HOUSE IS BURNING AND YET HURRIES THROUGH THE STREETS BORNE ALONG BY A LURKING HOPE OF A MISTAKE
2002-139469-0085 AND SEES HIS SHELTERING ROOF ENVELOPED IN A FLAME BEFORE IT HAD BEEN A RUMOUR BUT NOW IN WORDS UNERASEABLE IN DEFINITE AND UNDENIABLE PRINT THE KNOWLEDGE WENT FORTH
2002-139469-0086 ITS OBSCURITY OF SITUATION RENDERED IT THE MORE CONSPICUOUS THE DIMINUTIVE LETTERS GREW GIGANTIC TO THE BEWILDERED EYE OF FEAR THEY SEEMED GRAVEN
2002-139469-0087 WITH A PEN OF IRON IMPRESSED BY FIRE WOVEN IN THE CLOUDS STAMPED ON THE VERY FRONT OF THE UNIVERSE THE ENGLISH
2002-139469-0088 WHETHER TRAVELLERS OR RESIDENTS CAME POURING IN ONE GREAT REVULSIVE STREAM BACK ON THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND WITH THEM CROWDS OF ITALIANS AND SPANIARDS
2002-139469-0089 OUR LITTLE ISLAND WAS FILLED EVEN TO BURSTING AT FIRST AN UNUSUAL QUANTITY OF SPECIE MADE ITS APPEARANCE WITH THE EMIGRANTS BUT THESE PEOPLE HAD NO MEANS OF RECEIVING BACK INTO THEIR HANDS WHAT THEY SPENT AMONG US
2002-139469-0090 RENTS WERE UNPAID AND THEIR REMITTANCES FAILED THEM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE THESE CROWDS OF WRETCHED PERISHING CREATURES LATE NURSLINGS OF LUXURY
2002-139469-0091 AND NOT STRETCH OUT A HAND TO SAVE THEM AS AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THE ENGLISH UNLOCKED THEIR HOSPITABLE STORE FOR THE RELIEF OF THOSE DRIVEN FROM THEIR HOMES BY POLITICAL REVOLUTION
2002-139469-0092 SO NOW THEY WERE NOT BACKWARD IN AFFORDING AID TO THE VICTIMS OF A MORE WIDE SPREADING CALAMITY WE HAD MANY FOREIGN FRIENDS WHOM WE EAGERLY SOUGHT OUT AND RELIEVED FROM DREADFUL PENURY
2002-139469-0093 OUR CASTLE BECAME AN ASYLUM FOR THE UNHAPPY A LITTLE POPULATION OCCUPIED ITS HALLS THE REVENUE OF ITS POSSESSOR WHICH HAD ALWAYS FOUND A MODE OF EXPENDITURE CONGENIAL TO HIS GENEROUS NATURE
2002-139469-0094 WAS NOW ATTENDED TO MORE PARSIMONIOUSLY THAT IT MIGHT EMBRACE A WIDER PORTION OF UTILITY IT WAS NOT HOWEVER MONEY EXCEPT PARTIALLY BUT THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE
2002-139469-0095 THAT BECAME SCARCE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FIND AN IMMEDIATE REMEDY THE USUAL ONE OF IMPORTS WAS ENTIRELY CUT OFF IN THIS EMERGENCY TO FEED THE VERY PEOPLE TO WHOM WE HAD GIVEN REFUGE WE WERE OBLIGED TO YIELD TO THE PLOUGH
2002-139469-0096 OUR PLEASURE GROUNDS AND PARKS LIVE STOCK DIMINISHED SENSIBLY IN THE COUNTRY FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE GREAT DEMAND IN THE MARKET EVEN THE POOR DEER OUR ANTLERED PROTEGES
2002-139469-0097 WERE OBLIGED TO FALL FOR THE SAKE OF WORTHIER PENSIONERS THE LABOUR NECESSARY TO BRING THE LANDS TO THIS SORT OF CULTURE EMPLOYED AND FED THE OFFCASTS OF THE DIMINISHED MANUFACTORIES
2002-139469-0098 ADRIAN DID NOT REST ONLY WITH THE EXERTIONS HE COULD MAKE WITH REGARD TO HIS OWN POSSESSIONS HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE WEALTHY OF THE LAND HE MADE PROPOSALS IN PARLIAMENT LITTLE ADAPTED TO PLEASE THE RICH
2002-139469-0099 EARNEST PLEADINGS AND BENEVOLENT ELOQUENCE WERE IRRESISTIBLE TO GIVE UP THEIR PLEASURE GROUNDS TO THE AGRICULTURIST TO DIMINISH SENSIBLY THE NUMBER OF HORSES KEPT FOR THE PURPOSES OF LUXURY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
2002-139469-0100 YET TO THE HONOUR OF THE ENGLISH BE IT RECORDED THAT ALTHOUGH NATURAL
2002-139469-0101 MADE THEM DELAY AWHILE YET WHEN THE MISERY OF THEIR FELLOW CREATURES BECAME GLARING AN ENTHUSIASTIC GENEROSITY INSPIRED THEIR DECREES
2002-139469-0102 THE MOST LUXURIOUS WERE OFTEN THE FIRST TO PART WITH THEIR INDULGENCIES AS IS COMMON IN COMMUNITIES A FASHION WAS SET THE HIGH BORN LADIES OF THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE DEEMED THEMSELVES DISGRACED
2002-139469-0103 IF THEY HAD NOW ENJOYED WHAT THEY BEFORE CALLED A NECESSARY THE EASE OF A CARRIAGE CHAIRS AS IN OLDEN TIME AND INDIAN PALANQUINS WERE INTRODUCED FOR THE INFIRM
2002-139469-0104 BUT ELSE IT WAS NOTHING SINGULAR TO SEE FEMALES OF RANK GOING ON FOOT TO PLACES OF FASHIONABLE RESORT IT WAS MORE COMMON FOR ALL WHO POSSESSED LANDED PROPERTY TO SECEDE TO THEIR ESTATES
2002-139469-0105 ATTENDED BY WHOLE TROOPS OF THE INDIGENT TO CUT DOWN THEIR WOODS TO ERECT TEMPORARY DWELLINGS AND TO PORTION OUT THEIR PARKS PARTERRES AND FLOWER GARDENS
2002-139469-0106 TO NECESSITOUS FAMILIES MANY OF THESE OF HIGH RANK IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES NOW WITH HOE IN HAND TURNED UP THE SOIL IT WAS FOUND NECESSARY AT LAST
2002-139469-0107 TO CHECK THE SPIRIT OF SACRIFICE AND TO REMIND THOSE WHOSE GENEROSITY PROCEEDED TO LAVISH WASTE THAT UNTIL THE PRESENT STATE OF THINGS BECAME PERMANENT OF WHICH THERE WAS NO LIKELIHOOD
2002-139469-0108 SO FAR AS TO MAKE A REACTION DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE DEMONSTRATED THAT IN A YEAR OR TWO PESTILENCE WOULD CEASE IT WERE WELL THAT IN THE MEAN TIME
2002-139469-0109 WE SHOULD NOT HAVE DESTROYED OUR FINE BREEDS OF HORSES OR HAVE UTTERLY CHANGED THE FACE OF THE ORNAMENTED PORTION OF THE COUNTRY
2002-139469-0110 THE INFECTION HAD NOW SPREAD IN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCES OF FRANCE BUT THAT COUNTRY HAD SO MANY RESOURCES IN THE WAY OF AGRICULTURE
2002-139469-0111 AND ITS INCREASE THROUGH FOREIGN EMIGRATION WAS LESS FELT THAN WITH US THE PANIC STRUCK APPEARED OF MORE INJURY THAN DISEASE AND ITS NATURAL
2002-139469-0112 CONCOMITANTS WINTER WAS HAILED A GENERAL AND NEVER FAILING PHYSICIAN
2002-139469-0113 WERE WELCOMED WITH GRATITUDE THE EFFECTS OF PURIFYING COLD WERE IMMEDIATELY FELT AND THE LISTS OF MORTALITY ABROAD WERE
2002-139469-0114 MANY OF OUR VISITORS LEFT US THOSE WHOSE HOMES WERE FAR IN THE SOUTH FLED DELIGHTEDLY FROM OUR NORTHERN WINTER AND SOUGHT THEIR NATIVE LAND SECURE OF PLENTY EVEN AFTER THEIR FEARFUL
2002-139469-0115 VISITATION WE BREATHED AGAIN
2007-132570-0000 WHAT WERE THEY DISPUTING THEN SAID EMILY NO MA'AMSELLE NOR FIGHTING BUT ALMOST AS GOOD FOR I BELIEVE THERE WAS NOT ONE OF THE SIGNORS SOBER
2007-132570-0001 AND WHAT IS MORE NOT ONE OF THOSE FINE LADIES SOBER EITHER I THOUGHT WHEN I SAW THEM FIRST THAT ALL THOSE FINE SILKS AND FINE VEILS WHY MA'AMSELLE THEIR VEILS WERE WORKED WITH SILVER

2007-132570-0009 AND HE MISTOOK LUDOVICO'S HALL FOR OLD CARLO'S
2007-132570-0010 SO WE WERE ALL AS STILL AS NIGHT THAT HE MIGHT SUPPOSE THERE WAS NOBODY IN THE ROOM BUT THE SIGNOR WAS AS CUNNING AS THE BEST OF US AND KEPT CALLING OUT AT THE DOOR
2007-132570-0011 COME FORTH MY VALOROUS SIGNOR STEWARD JUST THEN OLD CARLO OPENED HIS DOOR AND HE CAME WITH A FLASK IN HIS HAND FOR AS SOON AS THE SIGNOR SAW HIM
2007-132570-0012 HE WAS AS TAME AS COULD BE AND FOLLOWED HIM AWAY AS NATURALLY AS A DOG DOES A BUTCHER WITH A PIECE OF MEAT IN HIS BASKET ALL THIS I SAW THROUGH THE KEY HOLE WELL ANNETTE SAID LUDOVICO JEERINGLY SHALL I LET YOU OUT NOW
2007-132570-0013 INTERRUPTED EMILY QUITE WEARIED BY THIS STORY DO YOU KNOW WHETHER THERE ARE ANY PRISONERS IN THE CASTLE AND WHETHER THEY ARE CONFINED AT THIS END OF THE EDIFICE
2007-132570-0014 BUT IT IS EXPECTED BACK TO NIGHT OR TO MORROW AND I SHALL KNOW THEN PERHAPS EMILY ENQUIRED IF SHE HAD EVER HEARD THE SERVANTS TALK OF PRISONERS AH MA'AMSELLE SAID ANNETTE ARCHLY
2007-132570-0015 NOW I DARE SAY YOU ARE THINKING OF MONSIEUR VALANCOURT AND THAT HE MAY HAVE COME AMONG THE ARMIES WHICH THEY SAY ARE COME FROM OUR COUNTRY TO FIGHT AGAINST THIS STATE AND THAT HE HAS MET WITH SOME OF OUR PEOPLE AND IS TAKEN CAPTIVE
2007-132570-0016 O LORD HOW GLAD I SHOULD BE IF IT WAS SO WOULD YOU INDEED BE GLAD SAID EMILY IN A TONE OF MOURNFUL REPROACH TO BE SURE I SHOULD
2007-132570-0017 MA'AM REPLIED ANNETTE AND WOULD NOT YOU BE GLAD TOO TO SEE SIGNOR VALANCOURT I DON'T KNOW ANY CHEVALIER I LIKE BETTER I HAVE A VERY GREAT REGARD FOR THE SIGNOR TRULY
2007-132570-0018 YOUR REGARD FOR HIM CANNOT BE DOUBTED SAID EMILY SINCE YOU WISH TO SEE HIM A PRISONER WHY NO MA'AMSELLE NOT A PRISONER EITHER BUT ONE MUST BE GLAD TO SEE HIM YOU KNOW AND IT WAS ONLY THE OTHER NIGHT I DREAMT
2007-132570-0019 AND THEN IT WAS GONE AND NOTHING TO BE SEEN BUT THE OLD CASTLE WALLS SO THEY HELPED ONE ANOTHER UP AGAIN AS FAST AS THEY COULD YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE MA'AMSELLE THOUGH I SHEWED YOU THE VERY CANNON WHERE IT USED TO APPEAR
2007-132570-0020 AND ARE YOU INDEED SO SIMPLE ANNETTE SAID EMILY SMILING AT THIS CURIOUS EXAGGERATION OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES SHE HAD WITNESSED AS TO CREDIT THESE STORIES CREDIT THEM MA'AMSELLE WHY
2007-132570-0021 ALL THE WORLD COULD NOT PERSUADE ME OUT OF THEM ROBERTO AND SEBASTIAN AND HALF A DOZEN MORE OF THEM WENT INTO FITS TO BE SURE THERE WAS NO OCCASION FOR THAT I SAID MYSELF THERE WAS NO NEED OF THAT
2007-132570-0022 FOR SAYS I WHEN THE ENEMY COMES WHAT A PRETTY FIGURE THEY WILL CUT IF THEY ARE TO FALL DOWN IN FITS ALL OF A ROW THE ENEMY WON'T BE SO CIVIL PERHAPS AS TO WALK OFF LIKE THE GHOST AND LEAVE THEM TO HELP ONE ANOTHER UP
2007-132570-0023 BUT WILL FALL TO CUTTING AND SLASHING TILL HE MAKES THEM ALL RISE UP DEAD MEN NO NO SAYS I THERE IS REASON IN ALL THINGS
2007-132570-0024 BEING BECAUSE IT IS NO BUSINESS OF MINE TO LOOK GRUFF AND FIGHT BATTLES EMILY ENDEAVOURED TO CORRECT THE SUPERSTITIOUS WEAKNESS OF ANNETTE THOUGH SHE COULD NOT ENTIRELY SUBDUE HER OWN TO WHICH THE LATTER ONLY REPLIED
2007-132570-0025 NAY MA'AMSELLE YOU WILL BELIEVE NOTHING YOU ARE ALMOST AS BAD AS THE SIGNOR HIMSELF WHO WAS IN A GREAT PASSION WHEN THEY TOLD OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND SWORE THAT THE FIRST MAN WHO REPEATED SUCH NONSENSE SHOULD BE THROWN INTO THE DUNGEON UNDER THE EAST TURRET THIS WAS A HARD
2007-132570-0026 BUT I DARE SAY HE HAD OTHER REASONS FOR CALLING IT SO THAN YOU HAVE MA'AM EMILY LOOKED DISPLEASED AND MADE NO REPLY AS SHE MUSED UPON THE RECOLLECTED APPEARANCE WHICH HAD LATELY SO MUCH ALARMED HER AND CONSIDERED THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE FIGURE HAVING STATIONED ITSELF
2007-132570-0027 OPPOSITE TO HER CASEMENT SHE WAS FOR A MOMENT INCLINED TO BELIEVE IT WAS VALANCOURT WHOM SHE HAD SEEN YET IF IT WAS HE WHY DID HE NOT SPEAK TO HER WHEN HE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF DOING SO AND IF HE WAS A PRISONER IN THE CASTLE
2007-132570-0028 AND HE COULD BE HERE IN NO OTHER CHARACTER HOW COULD HE OBTAIN THE MEANS OF WALKING ABROAD ON THE RAMPART
2007-132570-0029 WERE THE SAME OR IF THEY WERE WHETHER THIS WAS VALANCOURT SHE HOWEVER DESIRED THAT ANNETTE WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO LEARN WHETHER ANY PRISONERS WERE IN THE CASTLE AND ALSO THEIR NAMES O DEAR MA'AMSELLE SAID ANNETTE I FORGET TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU BADE ME ASK ABOUT
2007-132570-0030 THE LADIES AS THEY CALL THEMSELVES WHO ARE LATELY COME TO UDOLPHO WHY THAT SIGNORA LIVONA THAT THE SIGNOR BROUGHT TO SEE MY LATE LADY AT VENICE IS HIS MISTRESS NOW AND WAS LITTLE BETTER THEN I DARE SAY AND LUDOVICO SAYS
2007-132570-0031 BUT PRAY BE SECRET MA'AM THAT HIS EXCELLENZA INTRODUCED HER ONLY TO IMPOSE UPON THE WORLD THAT HAD BEGUN TO MAKE FREE WITH HER CHARACTER SO WHEN PEOPLE SAW MY LADY NOTICE HER THEY THOUGHT WHAT THEY HAD HEARD MUST BE SCANDAL
2007-132570-0032 BUT I THOUGHT THEY WERE DISMAL SOUNDS SO SOON AFTER MY POOR LADY'S DEATH TOO
2007-132570-0033 BUT SHE CANNOT HEAR THEM NOW POOR SOUL SAID I EMILY TURNED AWAY TO CONCEAL HER EMOTION AND THEN DESIRED ANNETTE TO GO AND MAKE ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE PRISONERS THAT MIGHT BE IN THE CASTLE
2007-132570-0034 BUT CONJURED HER TO DO IT WITH CAUTION AND ON NO ACCOUNT TO MENTION HER NAME OR THAT OF MONSIEUR VALANCOURT NOW I THINK OF IT MA'AMSELLE SAID ANNETTE I DO BELIEVE THERE ARE PRISONERS FOR I OVERHEARD ONE OF THE SIGNOR'S MEN YESTERDAY
2007-132570-0035 AND SAYING WHAT A FINE THING IT WAS FOR HIS EXCELLENZA TO CATCH UP MEN AND THEY WERE AS GOOD BOOTY AS ANY OTHER BECAUSE OF THE RANSOMS
2007-132570-0036 BECAUSE SAID HE WE DON'T GO SHARES THERE THIS INFORMATION HEIGHTENED EMILY'S IMPATIENCE TO KNOW MORE AND ANNETTE IMMEDIATELY DEPARTED ON HER ENQUIRY THE LATE RESOLUTION OF EMILY TO RESIGN HER ESTATES TO MONTONI NOW GAVE WAY TO NEW CONSIDERATIONS
2007-132570-0037 THE POSSIBILITY THAT VALANCOURT WAS NEAR HER REVIVED HER FORTITUDE AND SHE DETERMINED TO BRAVE THE THREATENED VENGEANCE AT LEAST TILL SHE COULD BE ASSURED WHETHER HE WAS REALLY IN THE CASTLE SHE WAS IN THIS TEMPER OF MIND WHEN SHE RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM MONTONI REQUIRING HER ATTENDANCE IN THE CEDAR PARLOUR
2007-132570-0038 WHICH SHE OBEYED WITH TREMBLING AND ON HER WAY THITHER ENDEAVOURED TO ANIMATE HER FORTITUDE WITH THE IDEA OF VALANCOURT MONTONI WAS ALONE I SENT FOR YOU SAID HE TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY OF RETRACTING YOUR LATE MISTAKEN ASSERTIONS
2007-132570-0039 I WILL CONDESCEND TO ADVISE WHERE I MAY COMMAND
2007-132570-0040 IF I HAVE NO RIGHT IN THESE ESTATES SIR SAID EMILY OF WHAT SERVICE CAN IT BE TO YOU THAT I SHOULD SIGN ANY PAPERS CONCERNING THEM IF THE LANDS ARE YOURS BY LAW YOU CERTAINLY MAY POSSESS THEM WITHOUT MY INTERFERENCE OR MY CONSENT
2007-132570-0041 I WILL HAVE NO MORE ARGUMENT SAID MONTONI WITH A LOOK THAT MADE HER TREMBLE WHAT HAD I BUT TROUBLE TO EXPECT WHEN I CONDESCENDED TO REASON WITH A BABY BUT I WILL BE TRIFLED WITH NO LONGER
2007-132570-0042 LET THE RECOLLECTION OF YOUR AUNT'S SUFFERINGS IN CONSEQUENCE OF HER FOLLY AND OBSTINACY TEACH YOU A LESSON SIGN THE PAPERS EMILY'S RESOLUTION WAS FOR A MOMENT AWED SHE SHRUNK AT THE RECOLLECTIONS HE REVIVED
2007-132570-0043 AND FROM THE VENGEANCE HE THREATENED BUT THEN THE IMAGE OF VALANCOURT WHO SO LONG HAD LOVED HER AND WHO WAS NOW PERHAPS SO NEAR HER CAME TO HER HEART AND TOGETHER WITH THE STRONG FEELINGS OF INDIGNATION WITH WHICH SHE HAD ALWAYS
2007-132570-0044 FROM HER INFANCY REGARDED AN ACT OF INJUSTICE INSPIRED HER WITH A NOBLE THOUGH IMPRUDENT COURAGE SIGN THE PAPERS SAID MONTONI MORE IMPATIENTLY THAN BEFORE NEVER SIR
2007-132570-0045 REPLIED EMILY THAT REQUEST WOULD HAVE PROVED TO ME THE INJUSTICE OF YOUR CLAIM HAD I EVEN BEEN IGNORANT OF MY RIGHT MONTONI TURNED PALE WITH ANGER WHILE HIS QUIVERING LIP AND LURKING EYE MADE HER ALMOST REPENT THE BOLDNESS OF HER SPEECH
2007-132570-0046 THEN ALL MY VENGEANCE FALLS UPON YOU HE EXCLAIMED WITH AN HORRIBLE OATH AND THINK NOT IT SHALL BE DELAYED
2007-132570-0047 YOU HAVE DARED TO QUESTION MY RIGHT NOW DARE TO QUESTION MY POWER I HAVE A PUNISHMENT WHICH YOU THINK NOT OF IT IS TERRIBLE THIS NIGHT THIS VERY NIGHT' THIS
2007-132570-0048 NIGHT REPEATED ANOTHER VOICE MONTONI PAUSED AND TURNED HALF ROUND BUT SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HIMSELF HE PROCEEDED IN A LOWER TONE YOU HAVE LATELY SEEN ONE TERRIBLE EXAMPLE OF OBSTINACY AND FOLLY
2007-132570-0049 YET THIS IT APPEARS HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENT TO DETER YOU
2007-132570-0050 I COULD MAKE YOU TREMBLE AT THE BARE RECITAL HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A GROAN WHICH SEEMED TO RISE FROM UNDERNEATH THE CHAMBER THEY WERE IN AND AS HE THREW A GLANCE ROUND IT IMPATIENCE AND RAGE FLASHED FROM HIS EYES
2007-132570-0051 YET SOMETHING LIKE A SHADE OF FEAR PASSED OVER HIS COUNTENANCE EMILY SAT DOWN IN A CHAIR NEAR THE DOOR FOR THE VARIOUS EMOTIONS SHE HAD SUFFERED NOW ALMOST OVERCAME HER BUT MONTONI PAUSED SCARCELY AN INSTANT AND COMMANDING HIS FEATURES
2007-132570-0052 RESUMED HIS DISCOURSE IN A LOWER YET STERNER VOICE I SAY I COULD GIVE YOU OTHER INSTANCES OF MY POWER AND OF MY CHARACTER WHICH IT SEEMS YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR YOU WOULD NOT DEFY ME
2007-132570-0053 I COULD TELL YOU THAT WHEN ONCE MY RESOLUTION IS TAKEN BUT I AM TALKING TO A BABY LET ME HOWEVER REPEAT THAT TERRIBLE AS ARE THE EXAMPLES I COULD RECITE THE RECITAL COULD NOT NOW BENEFIT YOU
2007-132570-0054 FOR THOUGH YOUR REPENTANCE WOULD PUT AN IMMEDIATE END TO OPPOSITION IT WOULD NOT NOW APPEASE MY INDIGNATION I WILL HAVE VENGEANCE AS WELL AS JUSTICE ANOTHER GROAN FILLED THE PAUSE WHICH MONTONI MADE
2007-132570-0055 LEAVE THE ROOM INSTANTLY SAID HE SEEMING NOT TO NOTICE THIS STRANGE OCCURRENCE WITHOUT POWER TO IMPLORE HIS PITY SHE ROSE TO GO BUT FOUND THAT SHE COULD NOT SUPPORT HERSELF AWE AND TERROR OVERCAME HER AND SHE SUNK AGAIN INTO THE CHAIR
2007-132570-0056 QUIT MY PRESENCE CRIED MONTONI THIS AFFECTATION OF FEAR ILL BECOMES THE HEROINE WHO HAS JUST DARED TO BRAVE MY INDIGNATION DID YOU HEAR NOTHING SIGNOR SAID EMILY TREMBLING AND STILL UNABLE TO LEAVE THE ROOM
2007-132570-0057 I HEARD MY OWN VOICE REJOINED MONTONI STERNLY AND NOTHING ELSE
2007-132570-0058 OBEY MY ORDER REPEATED MONTONI AND FOR THESE FOOL'S TRICKS I WILL SOON DISCOVER BY WHOM THEY ARE PRACTISED EMILY AGAIN ROSE AND EXERTED HERSELF TO THE UTMOST TO LEAVE THE ROOM WHILE MONTONI FOLLOWED HER
2007-132570-0059 BUT INSTEAD OF CALLING ALOUD TO HIS SERVANTS TO SEARCH THE CHAMBER AS HE HAD FORMERLY DONE ON A SIMILAR OCCURRENCE PASSED TO THE RAMPARTS AS IN HER WAY TO THE CORRIDOR SHE RESTED FOR A MOMENT AT AN OPEN CASEMENT EMILY SAW A PARTY OF MONTONI'S TROOPS WINDING DOWN A DISTANT MOUNTAIN
2007-132570-0060 WHOM SHE NOTICED NO FURTHER THAN AS THEY BROUGHT TO HER MIND THE WRETCHED PRISONERS THEY WERE PERHAPS BRINGING TO THE CASTLE AT LENGTH HAVING REACHED HER APARTMENT SHE THREW HERSELF UPON THE COUCH OVERCOME WITH THE NEW HORRORS OF HER SITUATION
2007-149877-0000 ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENING HE DINED AT RECTOR'S A RESTAURANT OF SOME LOCAL FAME WHICH OCCUPIED A BASEMENT AT CLARK AND MONROE STREETS THEREAFTER HE VISITED THE RESORT OF FITZGERALD AND MOY'S IN ADAMS STREET OPPOSITE THE IMPOSING FEDERAL BUILDING
2007-149877-0001 THERE HE LEANED OVER THE SPLENDID BAR AND SWALLOWED A GLASS OF PLAIN WHISKEY AND PURCHASED A COUPLE OF CIGARS ONE OF WHICH HE LIGHTED THIS TO HIM REPRESENTED IN PART HIGH LIFE A FAIR SAMPLE OF WHAT THE WHOLE MUST BE
2007-149877-0002 DROUET WAS NOT A DRINKER IN EXCESS HE WAS NOT A MONEYED MAN HE ONLY CRAVED THE BEST AS HIS MIND CONCEIVED IT AND SUCH DOINGS SEEMED TO HIM A PART OF THE BEST
2007-149877-0003 RECTOR'S WITH ITS POLISHED MARBLE WALLS AND FLOOR ITS PROFUSION OF LIGHTS ITS SHOW OF CHINA AND SILVERWARE AND ABOVE ALL ITS REPUTATION AS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AND PROFESSIONAL MEN SEEMED TO HIM THE PROPER PLACE FOR A SUCCESSFUL MAN TO GO
2007-149877-0004 HE LOVED FINE CLOTHES GOOD EATING AND PARTICULARLY THE COMPANY AND ACQUAINTANCESHIP OF SUCCESSFUL MEN WHEN DINING IT WAS A SOURCE OF KEEN SATISFACTION TO HIM TO KNOW THAT JOSEPH JEFFERSON WAS WONT TO COME TO THIS SAME PLACE
2007-149877-0005 OR THAT HENRY E DIXIE A WELL KNOWN PERFORMER OF THE DAY WAS THEN ONLY A FEW TABLES OFF AT RECTOR'S HE COULD ALWAYS OBTAIN THIS SATISFACTION FOR THERE ONE COULD ENCOUNTER POLITICIANS BROKERS ACTORS
2007-149877-0006 SOME RICH YOUNG ROUNDERS OF THE TOWN ALL EATING AND DRINKING AMID A BUZZ OF POPULAR COMMONPLACE CONVERSATION THAT'S SO AND SO OVER THERE WAS A COMMON REMARK OF THESE GENTLEMEN AMONG THEMSELVES
2007-149877-0007 PARTICULARLY AMONG THOSE WHO HAD NOT YET REACHED BUT HOPED TO DO SO THE DAZZLING HEIGHT WHICH MONEY TO DINE HERE LAVISHLY REPRESENTED YOU DON'T SAY SO WOULD BE THE REPLY WHY
2007-149877-0008 WHY HE'S MANAGER OF THE GRAND OPERA HOUSE WHEN THESE THINGS WOULD FALL UPON DROUET'S EARS HE WOULD STRAIGHTEN HIMSELF A LITTLE MORE STIFFLY AND EAT WITH SOLID COMFORT IF HE HAD ANY VANITY THIS AUGMENTED IT
2007-149877-0009 THE FLOORS WERE OF BRIGHTLY COLOURED TILES THE WALLS A COMPOSITION OF RICH DARK POLISHED WOOD WHICH REFLECTED THE LIGHT AND COLOURED STUCCO WORK WHICH GAVE THE PLACE A VERY SUMPTUOUS APPEARANCE
2007-149877-0010 THE LONG BAR WAS A BLAZE OF LIGHTS POLISHED WOOD WORK COLOURED AND CUT GLASSWARE AND MANY FANCY BOTTLES
2007-149877-0011 WITH RICH SCREENS FANCY WINES AND A LINE OF BAR GOODS UNSURPASSED IN THE COUNTRY AT RECTOR'S DROUET HAD MET MISTER G W HURSTWOOD MANAGER OF FITZGERALD AND MOY'S
2007-149877-0012 HE HAD BEEN POINTED OUT AS A VERY SUCCESSFUL AND WELL KNOWN MAN ABOUT TOWN HURSTWOOD LOOKED THE PART FOR BESIDES BEING SLIGHTLY UNDER FORTY HE HAD A GOOD STOUT CONSTITUTION AN ACTIVE MANNER AND A SOLID SUBSTANTIAL AIR
2007-149877-0013 WHICH WAS COMPOSED IN PART OF HIS FINE CLOTHES HIS CLEAN LINEN HIS JEWELS AND ABOVE ALL HIS OWN SENSE OF HIS IMPORTANCE DROUET IMMEDIATELY CONCEIVED A NOTION OF HIM AS BEING SOME ONE WORTH KNOWING
2007-149877-0014 AND WAS GLAD NOT ONLY TO MEET HIM BUT TO VISIT THE ADAMS STREET BAR THEREAFTER WHENEVER HE WANTED A DRINK OR A CIGAR HURSTWOOD WAS AN INTERESTING CHARACTER AFTER HIS KIND HE WAS SHREWD AND CLEVER IN MANY LITTLE THINGS
2007-149877-0015 AND CAPABLE OF CREATING A GOOD IMPRESSION HIS MANAGERIAL POSITION WAS FAIRLY IMPORTANT A KIND OF STEWARDSHIP WHICH WAS IMPOSING BUT LACKED FINANCIAL CONTROL HE HAD RISEN BY PERSEVERANCE AND INDUSTRY
2007-149877-0016 THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND FINANCIAL FUNCTIONS DEVOLVED UPON THE OWNERS
2007-149877-0017 AND UPON A CASHIER WHO LOOKED AFTER THE MONEY TAKEN IN FOR THE MOST PART HE LOUNGED ABOUT DRESSED IN EXCELLENT TAILORED SUITS OF IMPORTED GOODS A SOLITAIRE RING A FINE BLUE DIAMOND IN HIS TIE A STRIKING VEST OF SOME NEW PATTERN
2007-149877-0018 AND A WATCH CHAIN OF SOLID GOLD WHICH HELD A CHARM OF RICH DESIGN AND A WATCH OF THE LATEST MAKE AND ENGRAVING HE KNEW BY NAME AND COULD GREET PERSONALLY WITH A WELL OLD FELLOW
2007-149877-0019 HUNDREDS OF ACTORS MERCHANTS POLITICIANS AND THE GENERAL RUN OF SUCCESSFUL CHARACTERS ABOUT TOWN AND IT WAS PART OF HIS SUCCESS TO DO SO HE HAD A FINELY GRADUATED SCALE OF INFORMALITY AND FRIENDSHIP WHICH IMPROVED FROM THE HOW DO YOU DO
2007-149877-0020 WHO BY LONG FREQUENTING OF THE PLACE BECAME AWARE OF HIS POSITION TO THE WHY OLD MAN HOW ARE YOU WHICH HE ADDRESSED TO THOSE NOTED OR RICH INDIVIDUALS WHO KNEW HIM AND WERE INCLINED TO BE FRIENDLY THERE WAS A CLASS HOWEVER
2007-149877-0021 TOO RICH TOO FAMOUS OR TOO SUCCESSFUL WITH WHOM HE COULD NOT ATTEMPT ANY FAMILIARITY OF ADDRESS AND WITH THESE HE WAS PROFESSIONALLY TACTFUL ASSUMING A GRAVE AND DIGNIFIED ATTITUDE PAYING THEM THE DEFERENCE WHICH WOULD WIN THEIR GOOD FEELING
2007-149877-0022 WITHOUT IN THE LEAST COMPROMISING HIS OWN BEARING AND OPINIONS THERE WERE IN THE LAST PLACE A FEW GOOD FOLLOWERS NEITHER RICH NOR POOR FAMOUS NOR YET REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL WITH WHOM HE WAS FRIENDLY ON THE SCORE OF GOOD FELLOWSHIP
2007-149877-0023 THESE WERE THE KIND OF MEN WITH WHOM HE WOULD CONVERSE LONGEST AND MOST SERIOUSLY
2007-149877-0024 TO GO TO THE RACES THE THEATRES THE SPORTING ENTERTAINMENTS AT SOME OF THE CLUBS HE KEPT A HORSE AND NEAT TRAP HAD HIS WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN WHO WERE WELL ESTABLISHED IN A NEAT HOUSE ON THE NORTH SIDE NEAR LINCOLN PARK
2007-149877-0025 AND WAS ALTOGETHER A VERY ACCEPTABLE INDIVIDUAL OF OUR GREAT AMERICAN UPPER CLASS THE FIRST GRADE BELOW THE LUXURIOUSLY RICH
2007-149877-0026 THE LATTER'S GENIAL NATURE AND DRESSY APPEARANCE PLEASED HIM HE KNEW THAT DROUET WAS ONLY A TRAVELLING SALESMAN AND NOT ONE OF MANY YEARS AT THAT BUT THE FIRM OF BARTLETT CARYOE AND COMPANY
2007-149877-0027 HURSTWOOD KNEW CARYOE QUITE WELL HAVING DRUNK A GLASS NOW AND THEN WITH HIM IN COMPANY WITH SEVERAL OTHERS WHEN THE CONVERSATION WAS GENERAL
2007-149877-0028 A MODERATE SENSE OF HUMOUR AND COULD TELL A GOOD STORY WHEN THE OCCASION REQUIRED HE COULD TALK RACES WITH HURSTWOOD
2007-149877-0029 AND REPORT THE STATE OF TRADE IN THE CITIES WHICH HE VISITED AND SO MANAGED TO MAKE HIMSELF ALMOST INVARIABLY AGREEABLE TO NIGHT HE WAS PARTICULARLY SO SINCE HIS REPORT TO THE COMPANY HAD BEEN FAVOURABLY COMMENTED UPON
2007-149877-0030 HIS NEW SAMPLES HAD BEEN SATISFACTORILY SELECTED AND HIS TRIP MARKED OUT FOR THE NEXT SIX WEEKS WHY HELLO CHARLIE OLD MAN
2007-149877-0031 HOW GOES IT THE ROOM WAS CROWDED DROUET SHOOK HANDS BEAMING GOOD NATURE AND THEY STROLLED TOWARDS THE BAR OH ALL RIGHT I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN SIX WEEKS WHEN DID YOU GET IN
2007-149877-0032 FRIDAY SAID DROUET HAD A FINE TRIP GLAD OF IT SAID HURSTWOOD HIS BLACK EYES LIT WITH A WARMTH WHICH HALF DISPLACED THE COLD MAKE BELIEVE THAT USUALLY DWELT IN THEM WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE HE ADDED AS THE BARKEEPER IN SNOWY JACKET AND TIE
2007-149877-0033 LEANED TOWARD THEM FROM BEHIND THE BAR OLD PEPPER SAID DROUET A LITTLE OF THE SAME FOR ME PUT IN HURSTWOOD HOW LONG ARE YOU IN TOWN THIS TIME INQUIRED HURSTWOOD ONLY UNTIL WEDNESDAY I'M GOING UP TO SAINT PAUL
2007-149877-0034 GEORGE EVANS WAS IN HERE SATURDAY AND SAID HE SAW YOU IN MILWAUKEE LAST WEEK YES I SAW GEORGE RETURNED DROUET GREAT OLD BOY ISN'T HE WE HAD QUITE A TIME THERE TOGETHER
2007-149877-0035 AS WAS CONSIDERED PROPER AND HURSTWOOD TAKING THE BAREST SUGGESTION OF WHISKEY AND MODIFYING IT WITH SELTZER WHAT'S BECOME OF CARYOE REMARKED HURSTWOOD I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM AROUND HERE IN TWO WEEKS
2007-149877-0036 BARELY COMES DOWN TO THE OFFICE NOW JUST ONE BOY HASN'T HE ASKED HURSTWOOD YES AND A SWIFT PACER LAUGHED DROUET I
2007-149877-0037 NO HE CAN'T INJURE THAT ANY I GUESS HURSTWOOD WAS STANDING HIS COAT OPEN HIS THUMBS IN HIS POCKETS THE LIGHT ON HIS JEWELS AND RINGS RELIEVING THEM WITH AGREEABLE DISTINCTNESS HE WAS THE PICTURE OF FASTIDIOUS COMFORT
2007-149877-0038 TO ONE NOT INCLINED TO DRINK AND GIFTED WITH A MORE SERIOUS TURN OF MIND SUCH A BUBBLING CHATTERING GLITTERING CHAMBER MUST EVER SEEM AN ANOMALY A STRANGE COMMENTARY ON NATURE AND LIFE
2007-149877-0039 HERE COME THE MOTHS IN ENDLESS PROCESSION TO BASK IN THE LIGHT OF THE FLAME SUCH CONVERSATION AS ONE MAY HEAR WOULD NOT WARRANT A COMMENDATION OF THE SCENE UPON INTELLECTUAL GROUNDS
2007-149877-0040 IT SEEMS PLAIN THAT SCHEMERS WOULD CHOOSE MORE SEQUESTERED QUARTERS TO ARRANGE THEIR PLANS THAT POLITICIANS WOULD NOT GATHER HERE IN COMPANY TO DISCUSS ANYTHING SAVE FORMALITIES WHERE THE SHARP EARED MAY HEAR AND IT WOULD SCARCELY BE JUSTIFIED ON THE SCORE OF THIRST
2007-149877-0041 NEVERTHELESS THE FACT THAT HERE MEN GATHER HERE CHATTER HERE LOVE TO PASS AND RUB ELBOWS MUST BE EXPLAINED UPON SOME GROUNDS IT MUST BE THAT A STRANGE BUNDLE OF PASSIONS AND VAGUE DESIRES
2007-149877-0042 THE MANY FRIENDS HE MET HERE DROPPED IN BECAUSE THEY CRAVED
2007-149877-0043 THE COMPANY THE GLOW THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH THEY FOUND ONE MIGHT TAKE IT AFTER ALL AS AN AUGUR OF THE BETTER SOCIAL ORDER FOR THE THINGS WHICH THEY SATISFIED HERE THOUGH SENSORY WERE NOT EVIL
2007-149877-0044 NO EVIL COULD COME OUT OF THE CONTEMPLATION OF AN EXPENSIVELY DECORATED CHAMBER THE WORST EFFECT OF SUCH A THING WOULD BE PERHAPS TO STIR UP IN THE MATERIAL MINDED AN AMBITION TO ARRANGE THEIR LIVES UPON A SIMILARLY SPLENDID BASIS
2007-149877-0045 IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THAT WOULD SCARCELY BE CALLED THE FAULT OF THE DECORATIONS BUT RATHER OF THE INNATE TREND OF THE MIND THAT SUCH A SCENE MIGHT STIR THE LESS EXPENSIVELY DRESSED TO EMULATE THE MORE EXPENSIVELY DRESSED
2007-149877-0046 COULD SCARCELY BE LAID AT THE DOOR OF ANYTHING SAVE THE FALSE AMBITION OF THE MINDS OF THOSE SO AFFECTED REMOVE THE ELEMENT SO THOROUGHLY AND SOLELY COMPLAINED OF LIQUOR
2007-149877-0047 AND THERE WOULD NOT BE ONE TO GAINSAY THE QUALITIES OF BEAUTY AND ENTHUSIASM WHICH WOULD REMAIN THE PLEASED EYE WITH WHICH OUR MODERN RESTAURANTS OF FASHION ARE LOOKED UPON IS PROOF OF THIS ASSERTION YET HERE IS THE FACT OF THE LIGHTED CHAMBER
2007-149877-0048 THE DRESSY GREEDY COMPANY THE SMALL SELF INTERESTED PALAVER THE DISORGANIZED AIMLESS WANDERING MENTAL ACTION WHICH IT REPRESENTS THE LOVE OF LIGHT AND SHOW AND FINERY WHICH TO ONE OUTSIDE
2007-149877-0049 UNDER THE SERENE LIGHT OF THE ETERNAL STARS MUST SEEM A STRANGE AND SHINY THING UNDER THE STARS AND SWEEPING NIGHT WINDS WHAT A LAMP FLOWER IT MUST BLOOM A
2007-149877-0050 INSECT INFESTED ROSE OF PLEASURE SEE THAT FELLOW COMING IN THERE SAID HURSTWOOD GLANCING AT A GENTLEMAN JUST ENTERING ARRAYED IN A HIGH HAT AND PRINCE ALBERT COAT HIS FAT CHEEKS PUFFED AND RED AS WITH GOOD EATING
2007-149877-0051 NO WHERE SAID DROUET
2007-149877-0052 SAID HURSTWOOD INDICATING THE DIRECTION BY A CAST OF HIS EYE THE MAN WITH THE SILK HAT OH YES SAID DROUET NOW AFFECTING NOT TO SEE WHO IS HE THAT'S JULES WALLACE THE SPIRITUALIST
2007-149877-0053 DROUET FOLLOWED HIM WITH HIS EYES MUCH INTERESTED DOESN'T LOOK MUCH LIKE A MAN WHO SEES SPIRITS DOES HE SAID DROUET OH I
2007-149877-0054 RETURNED HURSTWOOD HE'S GOT THE MONEY ALL RIGHT AND A LITTLE TWINKLE PASSED OVER HIS EYES I DON'T GO MUCH ON THOSE THINGS DO YOU
2007-149877-0055 WELL YOU NEVER CAN TELL SAID HURSTWOOD THERE MAY BE SOMETHING TO IT I WOULDN'T BOTHER ABOUT IT MYSELF THOUGH BY THE WAY HE ADDED ARE YOU GOING ANYWHERE TO NIGHT THE HOLE IN THE GROUND
2007-149877-0056 SAID DROUET MENTIONING THE POPULAR FARCE OF THE TIME WELL YOU'D BETTER BE GOING IT'S HALF AFTER EIGHT ALREADY AND HE DREW OUT HIS WATCH THE CROWD WAS ALREADY THINNING OUT CONSIDERABLY
2007-149877-0057 SOME BOUND FOR THE THEATRES SOME TO THEIR CLUBS AND SOME TO THAT MOST FASCINATING OF ALL THE PLEASURES FOR THE TYPE OF MAN THERE REPRESENTED AT LEAST THE LADIES YES I WILL SAID DROUET
2007-149877-0058 COME AROUND AFTER THE SHOW I HAVE SOMETHING I WANT TO SHOW YOU SAID HURSTWOOD SURE SAID DROUET ELATED YOU HAVEN'T ANYTHING ON HAND FOR THE NIGHT HAVE YOU ADDED HURSTWOOD NOT A THING WELL COME ROUND THEN
2007-149877-0059 I STRUCK A LITTLE PEACH COMING IN ON THE TRAIN FRIDAY REMARKED DROUET BY WAY OF PARTING BY GEORGE THAT'S SO I MUST GO AND CALL ON HER BEFORE I GO AWAY OH NEVER MIND HER HURSTWOOD REMARKED
2007-149877-0060 SAY SHE WAS A LITTLE DANDY I TELL YOU
2007-149877-0061 TWELVE O'CLOCK SAID HURSTWOOD THAT'S RIGHT
201-122255-0000 THEN UP GOT LITTLE JOHN AND TAKING THE BAG OF GOLD WHICH HE THRUST INTO HIS BOSOM
201-122255-0001 AND ON THE OTHER AS WELL LITTLE JOHN KNEW TO THE MERRY BLUE BOAR INN HERE LITTLE JOHN SUDDENLY CEASED WHISTLING AND STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH FIRST HE LOOKED UP AND THEN HE LOOKED DOWN AND THEN TILTING HIS CAP OVER ONE EYE HE SLOWLY SCRATCHED THE BACK PART OF HIS HEAD FOR THUS IT WAS
201-122255-0002 AT THE SIGHT OF THESE TWO ROADS TWO VOICES BEGAN TO ALARUM WITHIN HIM THE ONE CRYING THERE LIES THE ROAD TO THE BLUE BOAR INN A CAN OF BROWN OCTOBER AND A MERRY NIGHT WITH SWEET COMPANIONS SUCH AS THOU MAYST FIND THERE THE OTHER
201-122255-0003 LOOKING UP INTO THE BLUE SKY ACROSS WHICH BRIGHT CLOUDS WERE SAILING LIKE SILVER BOATS AND SWALLOWS SKIMMING IN CIRCLING FLIGHT QUOTH HE
201-122255-0004 FOR I KNOW MY GOOD MASTER WOULD NOT HAVE ME WET TO THE SKIN SO WITHOUT MORE ADO OFF HE STRODE DOWN THE PATH THAT LAY THE WAY OF HIS LIKINGS NOW THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY FOUL WEATHER BUT
201-122255-0005 FRESH CANS OF ALE WERE BROUGHT AND WITH JEST AND SONG AND MERRY TALES THE HOURS SLIPPED AWAY ON FLEETING WINGS NONE THOUGHT OF TIME OR TIDE TILL THE NIGHT WAS SO FAR GONE THAT LITTLE JOHN PUT BY THE THOUGHT OF SETTING FORTH UPON HIS JOURNEY AGAIN THAT NIGHT AND SO
201-122255-0006 BIDED AT THE BLUE BOAR INN UNTIL THE MORROW NOW IT WAS AN ILL PIECE OF LUCK FOR LITTLE JOHN THAT HE LEFT HIS DUTY FOR HIS PLEASURE AND HE PAID A GREAT SCORE FOR IT AS WE ARE ALL APT TO DO IN THE SAME CASE AS YOU SHALL SEE
201-122255-0007 AND TAKING HIS STOUT PIKESTAFF IN HIS HAND HE SET FORTH UPON HIS JOURNEY ONCE MORE AS THOUGH HE WOULD MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME IN THE GOOD TOWN OF BLYTH THERE LIVED A STOUT TANNER CELEBRATED FAR AND NEAR FOR FEATS OF STRENGTH AND MANY TOUGH BOUTS AT WRESTLING AND THE QUARTERSTAFF
201-122255-0008 BESIDES ALL THIS HE DEARLY LOVED THE LONGBOW
201-122255-0009 SO THAT THE KING'S RANGERS KEPT A SHREWD EYE UPON HIM AND HIS DOINGS FOR ARTHUR A BLAND'S HOUSE WAS APT TO HAVE APLENTY OF MEAT IN IT THAT WAS MORE LIKE VENISON THAN THE LAW ALLOWED NOW ARTHUR HAD BEEN TO NOTTINGHAM TOWN THE DAY BEFORE LITTLE JOHN SET FORTH ON HIS ERRAND
201-122255-0010 THERE TO SELL A HALFSCORE OF TANNED COWHIDES AT THE DAWN OF THE SAME DAY THAT LITTLE JOHN LEFT THE INN HE STARTED FROM NOTTINGHAM HOMEWARD FOR BLYTH HIS WAY LED ALL IN THE DEWY MORN PAST THE VERGE OF SHERWOOD FOREST WHERE THE BIRDS WERE WELCOMING THE LOVELY DAY WITH A GREAT AND MERRY JUBILEE
201-122255-0011 ACROSS THE TANNER'S SHOULDERS WAS SLUNG HIS STOUT QUARTERSTAFF EVER NEAR ENOUGH TO HIM TO BE GRIPPED QUICKLY AND ON HIS HEAD WAS A CAP OF DOUBLED COWHIDE SO TOUGH THAT IT COULD HARDLY BE CLOVEN EVEN BY A BROADSWORD NOW QUOTH ARTHUR A BLAND TO HIMSELF
201-122255-0012 MAYHAP I MAY CHANCE TO CATCH A SIGHT OF THE DAINTY BROWN DARLINGS THUS EARLY IN THE MORN FOR THERE WAS NOTHING HE LOVED BETTER THAN TO LOOK UPON A TRIPPING HERD OF DEER
201-122255-0013 ACCORDINGLY QUITTING THE PATH HE WENT PEEPING THIS WAY AND THAT THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH SPYING NOW HERE AND NOW THERE WITH ALL THE WILES OF A MASTER OF WOODCRAFT AND OF ONE WHO HAD MORE THAN ONCE DONNED A DOUBLET OF LINCOLN GREEN
201-122255-0014 THAT SPRINGING FROM THE DEWY GRASS HUNG ALOFT ON QUIVERING WINGS IN THE YELLOW SUNLIGHT POURING FORTH ITS SONG THAT FELL LIKE A FALLING STAR FROM THE SKY HIS LUCK LED HIM AWAY FROM THE HIGHWAY NOT FAR FROM THE SPOT WHERE ARTHUR A BLAND WAS PEEPING THIS WAY AND THAT THROUGH THE LEAVES OF THE THICKETS
201-122255-0015 HEARING A RUSTLING OF THE BRANCHES LITTLE JOHN STOPPED AND PRESENTLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE BROWN COWHIDE CAP OF THE TANNER MOVING AMONG THE BUSHES I DO MUCH WONDER
201-122255-0016 QUOTH LITTLE JOHN TO HIMSELF WHAT YON KNAVE IS AFTER THAT HE SHOULD GO THUS PEEPING AND PEERING ABOUT I VERILY BELIEVE THAT YON SCURVY VARLET IS NO BETTER THAN A THIEF AND COMETH HERE AFTER OUR OWN AND THE GOOD KING'S DUN DEER FOR
201-122255-0017 BY MUCH ROVING IN THE FOREST LITTLE JOHN HAD COME TO LOOK UPON ALL THE DEER IN SHERWOOD AS BELONGING TO ROBIN HOOD AND HIS BAND AS MUCH AS TO GOOD KING HARRY NAY
201-122255-0018 LITTLE JOHN TROD UPON A STICK WHICH SNAPPED UNDER HIS FOOT WHEREUPON HEARING THE NOISE THE TANNER TURNED QUICKLY AND CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE YEOMAN SEEING THAT THE TANNER HAD SPIED HIM OUT LITTLE JOHN PUT A BOLD FACE UPON THE MATTER
201-122255-0019 BUT AN HONEST CRAFTSMAN AS FOR MY COUNTENANCE IT IS WHAT IT IS AND FOR THE MATTER OF THAT THINE OWN IS NONE TOO PRETTY THOU SAUCY FELLOW HA QUOTH LITTLE JOHN IN A GREAT LOUD VOICE WOULDST THOU GIVE ME BACKTALK
201-122255-0020 I AND MY FRIENDS DO TAKE GOOD CARE OF OUR GOOD SOVEREIGN'S DEER I CARE NOT WHO THOU ART ANSWERED THE BOLD TANNER AND UNLESS THOU HAST MANY MORE OF THY KIND BY THEE THOU CANST NEVER MAKE ARTHUR A BLAND CRY A MERCY
201-122255-0021 FOR I WILL GIVE THEE SUCH A DRUBBING AS NE'ER HAST THOU HAD IN ALL THY LIFE BEFORE TAKE THY STAFF IN THY HAND FELLOW FOR I WILL NOT SMITE AN UNARMED MAN
201-122255-0022 FOR HE TOO HAD TALKED HIMSELF INTO A FUME BIG WORDS NE'ER KILLED SO MUCH AS A MOUSE WHO ART THOU THAT TALKEST SO FREELY OF CRACKING THE HEAD OF ARTHUR A BLAND IF I DO NOT TAN THY HIDE THIS DAY AS NE'ER I TANNED A CALF'S HIDE IN ALL MY LIFE BEFORE
201-122255-0023 NAY I PASS NOT FOR LENGTH ANSWERED THE TANNER MY STAFF IS LONG ENOUGH TO KNOCK DOWN A CALF SO LOOK TO THYSELF FELLOW I SAY AGAIN SO WITHOUT MORE ADO EACH GRIPPED HIS STAFF IN THE MIDDLE AND WITH FELL AND ANGRY LOOKS THEY CAME SLOWLY TOGETHER
201-122255-0024 NOW NEWS HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO ROBIN HOOD HOW THAT LITTLE JOHN INSTEAD OF DOING HIS BIDDING HAD PASSED BY DUTY FOR PLEASURE AND SO HAD STOPPED OVERNIGHT WITH MERRY COMPANY AT THE BLUE BOAR INN INSTEAD OF GOING STRAIGHT TO ANCASTER
201-122255-0025 SO BEING VEXED TO HIS HEART BY THIS HE SET FORTH AT DAWN OF DAY TO SEEK LITTLE JOHN AT THE BLUE BOAR OR AT LEAST TO MEET THE YEOMAN ON THE WAY AND EASE HIS HEART OF WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE MATTER
201-122255-0026 AS THUS HE STRODE ALONG IN ANGER PUTTING TOGETHER THE WORDS HE WOULD USE TO CHIDE LITTLE JOHN HE HEARD OF A SUDDEN LOUD AND ANGRY VOICES
201-122255-0027 AT THIS ROBIN HOOD STOPPED AND LISTENED SURELY QUOTH HE TO HIMSELF THAT IS LITTLE JOHN'S VOICE AND HE IS TALKING IN ANGER ALSO METHINKS THE OTHER IS STRANGE TO MY EARS
201-122255-0028 NOW HEAVEN FORFEND THAT MY GOOD TRUSTY LITTLE JOHN SHOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE KING'S RANGERS I MUST SEE TO THIS MATTER AND THAT QUICKLY THUS SPOKE ROBIN HOOD TO HIMSELF ALL HIS ANGER PASSING AWAY LIKE A BREATH FROM THE WINDOWPANE
201-122255-0029 AT THE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HIS TRUSTY RIGHT HAND MAN WAS IN SOME DANGER OF HIS LIFE SO CAUTIOUSLY
201-122255-0030 HA QUOTH ROBIN TO HIMSELF HERE IS MERRY SPORT AFOOT NOW I WOULD GIVE THREE GOLDEN ANGELS FROM MY OWN POCKET IF YON STOUT FELLOW WOULD GIVE LITTLE JOHN A RIGHT SOUND DRUBBING IT WOULD PLEASE ME TO SEE HIM WELL THUMPED FOR HAVING FAILED IN MY BIDDING
201-122255-0031 I FEAR ME THOUGH THERE IS BUT POOR CHANCE OF MY SEEING SUCH A PLEASANT SIGHT SO SAYING HE STRETCHED HIMSELF AT LENGTH UPON THE GROUND THAT HE MIGHT NOT ONLY SEE THE SPORT THE BETTER BUT THAT HE MIGHT ENJOY THE MERRY SIGHT AT HIS EASE
201-122255-0032 EACH WATCHING FOR A CHANCE TO TAKE THE OTHER UNAWARE AND SO GET IN THE FIRST BLOW AT LAST LITTLE JOHN STRUCK LIKE A FLASH AND RAP THE TANNER MET THE BLOW AND TURNED IT ASIDE AND THEN SMOTE BACK AT LITTLE JOHN WHO ALSO TURNED THE BLOW AND SO THIS MIGHTY BATTLE BEGAN
201-122255-0033 NEVER HAD I THOUGHT TO SEE LITTLE JOHN SO EVENLY MATCHED IN ALL MY LIFE BELIKE THOUGH
201-122255-0034 HIS CUDGEL FLYING FROM HIS HAND AS HE FELL THEN RAISING HIS STAFF STOUT ARTHUR DEALT HIM ANOTHER BLOW UPON THE RIBS HOLD ROARED LITTLE JOHN

201-122255-0036 SAID LITTLE JOHN SITTING UP AND FEELING HIS RIBS WHERE THE TANNER HAD CUDGELED HIM I MAKE MY VOW MY RIBS FEEL AS THOUGH EVERY ONE OF THEM WERE BROKEN IN TWAIN
201-122255-0037 I DID THINK THERE WAS NEVER A MAN IN ALL NOTTINGHAMSHIRE COULD DO TO ME WHAT THOU HAST DONE THIS DAY AND SO THOUGHT I ALSO CRIED ROBIN HOOD BURSTING OUT OF THE THICKET AND SHOUTING WITH LAUGHTER TILL THE TEARS RAN DOWN HIS CHEEKS
201-122255-0038 HAND AND FOOT TO ANY MAN IN ALL MERRY ENGLAND I WAS SEEKING THEE TO CHIDE THEE FOR LEAVING MY BIDDING UNDONE BUT THOU HAST BEEN PAID ALL I OWED THEE

201-122255-0043 I WILL FOLLOW THEE TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH GOOD MASTER AND NOT A HERD OF DUN DEER IN ALL THE FOREST BUT SHALL KNOW THE SOUND OF THE TWANG OF MY BOWSTRING AS FOR THEE LITTLE JOHN SAID ROBIN TURNING TO HIM AND LAUGHING
201-122255-0044 THERE ARE OTHER INNS THAT THOU KNOWEST YET HEREABOUTS
201-127786-0000 HAPPY AND FORTUNATE WERE THE TIMES WHEN THAT MOST DARING KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WAS SENT INTO THE WORLD
201-127786-0001 BUT ALSO OF THE TALES AND EPISODES CONTAINED IN IT WHICH ARE IN A MEASURE NO LESS PLEASING INGENIOUS AND TRUTHFUL THAN THE HISTORY ITSELF WHICH RESUMING ITS THREAD CARDED SPUN AND WOUND RELATES THAT JUST AS THE CURATE WAS GOING TO OFFER CONSOLATION TO CARDENIO
201-127786-0002 ALL THIS WAS HEARD DISTINCTLY BY THE CURATE AND THOSE WITH HIM AND AS IT SEEMED TO THEM TO BE UTTERED CLOSE BY AS INDEED IT WAS THEY GOT UP TO LOOK FOR THE SPEAKER AND BEFORE THEY HAD GONE TWENTY PACES THEY DISCOVERED BEHIND A ROCK SEATED AT THE FOOT OF AN ASH TREE
201-127786-0003 A YOUTH IN THE DRESS OF A PEASANT WHOSE FACE THEY WERE UNABLE AT THE MOMENT TO SEE AS HE WAS LEANING FORWARD BATHING HIS FEET IN THE BROOK THAT FLOWED PAST THEY APPROACHED SO SILENTLY THAT HE DID NOT PERCEIVE THEM BEING FULLY OCCUPIED IN BATHING HIS FEET
201-127786-0004 CRUSH CLODS OR TO FOLLOW THE PLOUGH AND THE OXEN AS THEIR OWNER'S DRESS SUGGESTED AND SO FINDING THEY HAD NOT BEEN NOTICED THE CURATE WHO WAS IN FRONT MADE A SIGN TO THE OTHER TWO TO CONCEAL THEMSELVES BEHIND SOME FRAGMENTS OF ROCK THAT LAY THERE
201-127786-0005 WHICH THEY DID OBSERVING CLOSELY WHAT THE YOUTH WAS ABOUT HE HAD ON A LOOSE DOUBLE SKIRTED DARK BROWN JACKET BOUND TIGHT TO HIS BODY WITH A WHITE CLOTH HE WORE BESIDES BREECHES AND GAITERS OF BROWN CLOTH AND ON HIS HEAD A BROWN MONTERA AND
201-127786-0006 AS THIS IS NOT LUSCINDA IT IS NO HUMAN CREATURE BUT A DIVINE BEING THE YOUTH THEN TOOK OFF THE MONTERA AND SHAKING HIS HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE THERE BROKE LOOSE AND SPREAD OUT A MASS OF HAIR THAT THE BEAMS OF THE SUN MIGHT HAVE ENVIED
201-127786-0007 BY THIS THEY KNEW THAT WHAT HAD SEEMED A PEASANT WAS A LOVELY WOMAN NAY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THE EYES OF TWO OF THEM HAD EVER BEHELD OR EVEN CARDENIO'S IF THEY HAD NOT SEEN AND KNOWN LUSCINDA
201-127786-0008 THE LONG AUBURN TRESSES NOT ONLY COVERED HER SHOULDERS BUT SUCH WAS THEIR LENGTH AND ABUNDANCE CONCEALED HER ALL ROUND BENEATH THEIR MASSES SO THAT EXCEPT THE FEET NOTHING OF HER FORM WAS VISIBLE SHE NOW USED HER HANDS AS A COMB
201-127786-0009 AND IF HER FEET HAD SEEMED LIKE BITS OF CRYSTAL IN THE WATER HER HANDS LOOKED LIKE PIECES OF DRIVEN SNOW AMONG HER LOCKS ALL WHICH INCREASED NOT ONLY THE ADMIRATION OF THE THREE BEHOLDERS BUT THEIR ANXIETY TO LEARN WHO SHE WAS WITH THIS OBJECT THEY RESOLVED TO SHOW THEMSELVES
201-127786-0010 HER DELICATE FEET BEING UNABLE TO BEAR THE ROUGHNESS OF THE STONES SEEING WHICH THE THREE HASTENED TOWARDS HER AND THE CURATE ADDRESSING HER FIRST SAID STAY SENORA WHOEVER YOU MAY BE FOR THOSE WHOM YOU SEE HERE ONLY DESIRE TO BE OF SERVICE TO YOU
201-127786-0011 YOU HAVE NO NEED TO ATTEMPT A FLIGHT SO HEEDLESS FOR NEITHER CAN YOUR FEET BEAR IT NOR WE ALLOW IT TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND BEWILDERED SHE MADE NO REPLY TO THESE WORDS THEY HOWEVER CAME TOWARDS HER AND THE CURATE TAKING HER HAND WENT ON TO SAY
201-127786-0012 WHAT YOUR DRESS WOULD HIDE SENORA IS MADE KNOWN TO US BY YOUR HAIR A CLEAR PROOF THAT IT CAN BE NO TRIFLING CAUSE THAT HAS DISGUISED YOUR BEAUTY IN A GARB SO UNWORTHY OF IT AND SENT IT INTO SOLITUDES LIKE THESE WHERE WE HAVE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO FIND YOU
201-127786-0013 IF NOT TO RELIEVE YOUR DISTRESS AT LEAST TO OFFER YOU COMFORT FOR NO DISTRESS SO LONG AS LIFE LASTS CAN BE SO OPPRESSIVE OR REACH SUCH A HEIGHT AS TO MAKE THE SUFFERER REFUSE TO LISTEN TO COMFORT OFFERED WITH GOOD INTENTION AND SO SENORA
201-127786-0014 BUT ON THE CURATE ADDRESSING SOME FURTHER WORDS TO THE SAME EFFECT TO HER SIGHING DEEPLY SHE BROKE SILENCE AND SAID SINCE THE SOLITUDE OF THESE MOUNTAINS HAS BEEN UNABLE TO CONCEAL ME AND THE ESCAPE OF MY DISHEVELLED TRESSES WILL NOT ALLOW MY TONGUE TO DEAL IN FALSEHOODS
201-127786-0015 IT WOULD BE IDLE FOR ME NOW TO MAKE ANY FURTHER PRETENCE OF WHAT IF YOU WERE TO BELIEVE ME YOU WOULD BELIEVE MORE OUT OF COURTESY THAN FOR ANY OTHER REASON
201-127786-0016 THIS BEING SO I SAY I THANK YOU SIRS FOR THE OFFER YOU HAVE MADE ME WHICH PLACES ME UNDER THE OBLIGATION OF COMPLYING WITH THE REQUEST YOU HAVE MADE OF ME THOUGH I FEAR THE ACCOUNT I SHALL GIVE YOU OF MY MISFORTUNES WILL EXCITE IN YOU AS MUCH CONCERN AS COMPASSION
201-127786-0017 FOR YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SUGGEST ANYTHING TO REMEDY THEM OR ANY CONSOLATION TO ALLEVIATE THEM HOWEVER THAT MY HONOUR MAY NOT BE LEFT A MATTER OF DOUBT IN YOUR MINDS NOW THAT YOU HAVE DISCOVERED ME TO BE A WOMAN
201-127786-0018 I FEEL BOUND TO TELL WHAT I WOULD WILLINGLY KEEP SECRET IF I COULD ALL THIS SHE WHO WAS NOW SEEN TO BE A LOVELY WOMAN DELIVERED WITHOUT ANY HESITATION WITH SO MUCH EASE AND IN SO SWEET A VOICE THAT THEY WERE NOT LESS CHARMED BY HER INTELLIGENCE THAN BY HER BEAUTY
201-127786-0019 AND AS THEY AGAIN REPEATED THEIR OFFERS AND ENTREATIES TO HER TO FULFIL HER PROMISE SHE WITHOUT FURTHER PRESSING FIRST MODESTLY COVERING HER FEET AND GATHERING UP HER HAIR SEATED HERSELF ON A STONE WITH THE THREE PLACED AROUND HER AND
201-127786-0020 AFTER AN EFFORT TO RESTRAIN SOME TEARS THAT CAME TO HER EYES IN A CLEAR AND STEADY VOICE BEGAN HER STORY THUS
201-127786-0021 LOWLY IN ORIGIN BUT SO WEALTHY THAT IF BIRTH HAD CONFERRED AS MUCH ON THEM AS FORTUNE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD NOTHING LEFT TO DESIRE NOR SHOULD I HAVE HAD REASON TO FEAR TROUBLE LIKE THAT IN WHICH I FIND MYSELF NOW
201-127786-0022 FOR IT MAY BE THAT MY ILL FORTUNE CAME OF THEIRS IN NOT HAVING BEEN NOBLY BORN IT IS TRUE THEY ARE NOT SO LOW THAT THEY HAVE ANY REASON TO BE ASHAMED OF THEIR CONDITION
201-127786-0023 THEY ARE IN SHORT PEASANTS
201-127786-0024 AND AS THE SAYING IS OLD RUSTY CHRISTIANS BUT SO RICH THAT BY THEIR WEALTH AND FREE HANDED WAY OF LIFE THEY ARE COMING BY DEGREES TO BE CONSIDERED GENTLEFOLK BY BIRTH AND EVEN BY POSITION
201-127786-0025 AND AS THEY HAVE NO OTHER CHILD TO MAKE THEIR HEIR AND ARE AFFECTIONATE PARENTS I WAS ONE OF THE MOST INDULGED DAUGHTERS THAT EVER PARENTS INDULGED
201-127786-0026 ALL THEIR WISHES CENTRED AND MINE WERE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIRS FOR I KNEW THEIR WORTH AND AS I WAS MISTRESS OF THEIR HEARTS SO WAS I ALSO OF THEIR POSSESSIONS THROUGH ME THEY ENGAGED OR DISMISSED THEIR SERVANTS
201-127786-0027 THROUGH MY HANDS PASSED THE ACCOUNTS AND RETURNS OF WHAT WAS SOWN AND REAPED THE OIL MILLS THE WINE PRESSES THE COUNT OF THE FLOCKS AND HERDS THE BEEHIVES ALL IN SHORT THAT A RICH FARMER LIKE MY FATHER HAS OR CAN HAVE I HAD UNDER MY CARE
201-127786-0028 FOR EXPERIENCE TAUGHT ME THAT MUSIC SOOTHES THE TROUBLED MIND AND RELIEVES WEARINESS OF SPIRIT SUCH WAS THE LIFE I LED IN MY PARENTS HOUSE AND IF I HAVE DEPICTED IT THUS MINUTELY IT IS NOT OUT OF OSTENTATION OR TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I AM RICH BUT
201-127786-0029 AND UNSEEN AS I THOUGHT BY ANY EXCEPT THE SERVANTS OF THE HOUSE FOR WHEN I WENT TO MASS IT WAS SO EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I WAS SO CLOSELY ATTENDED BY MY MOTHER AND THE WOMEN OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND
201-127786-0030 FOR THAT IS THE NAME OF THE YOUNGER SON OF THE DUKE I TOLD OF THE MOMENT THE SPEAKER MENTIONED THE NAME OF DON FERNANDO
201-127786-0031 FOR HE BEGAN TO SUSPECT WHO SHE WAS SHE HOWEVER WITHOUT NOTICING THE EXCITEMENT OF CARDENIO CONTINUING HER STORY WENT ON TO SAY
201-127786-0032 AND I WAS NOT DISPLEASED AT SEEING MY PRAISES IN HIS LETTERS FOR HOWEVER UGLY WE WOMEN MAY BE IT SEEMS TO ME IT ALWAYS PLEASES US TO HEAR OURSELVES CALLED BEAUTIFUL BUT THAT MY OWN SENSE OF RIGHT WAS OPPOSED TO ALL THIS
201-127786-0033 AS WELL AS THE REPEATED ADVICE OF MY PARENTS WHO NOW VERY PLAINLY PERCEIVED DON FERNANDO'S PURPOSE FOR HE CARED VERY LITTLE IF ALL THE WORLD KNEW IT THEY TOLD ME THEY TRUSTED AND CONFIDED THEIR HONOUR AND GOOD NAME TO MY VIRTUE
201-127786-0034 AND RECTITUDE ALONE AND BADE ME CONSIDER THE DISPARITY BETWEEN DON FERNANDO AND MYSELF FROM WHICH I MIGHT CONCLUDE THAT HIS INTENTIONS WHATEVER HE MIGHT SAY TO THE CONTRARY HAD FOR THEIR AIM HIS OWN PLEASURE RATHER THAN MY ADVANTAGE
201-127786-0035 AND IF I WERE AT ALL DESIROUS OF OPPOSING AN OBSTACLE TO HIS UNREASONABLE SUIT THEY WERE READY THEY SAID TO MARRY ME AT ONCE TO ANYONE I PREFERRED EITHER AMONG THE LEADING PEOPLE OF OUR OWN TOWN OR
201-127786-0036 AND I NEVER GAVE DON FERNANDO A WORD IN REPLY THAT COULD HOLD OUT TO HIM ANY HOPE OF SUCCESS HOWEVER REMOTE ALL THIS CAUTION OF MINE WHICH HE MUST HAVE TAKEN FOR COYNESS HAD APPARENTLY THE EFFECT OF INCREASING HIS WANTON APPETITE FOR
201-127786-0037 OR AT LEAST TO SECURE ADDITIONAL PROTECTORS TO WATCH OVER ME AND THIS INTELLIGENCE OR SUSPICION MADE HIM ACT AS YOU SHALL HEAR ONE NIGHT AS I WAS IN MY CHAMBER WITH NO OTHER COMPANION THAN A DAMSEL WHO WAITED ON ME WITH
201-127786-0038 I HAD NO POWER TO UTTER A CRY NOR I THINK DID HE GIVE ME TIME TO UTTER ONE AS HE IMMEDIATELY APPROACHED ME AND TAKING ME IN HIS ARMS FOR OVERWHELMED AS I WAS I WAS POWERLESS I SAY TO HELP MYSELF HE BEGAN TO MAKE SUCH
201-127786-0039 PROFESSIONS TO ME THAT I KNOW NOT HOW FALSEHOOD COULD HAVE HAD THE POWER OF DRESSING THEM UP TO SEEM SO LIKE TRUTH AND THE TRAITOR CONTRIVED THAT HIS TEARS SHOULD VOUCH FOR HIS WORDS AND HIS SIGHS FOR HIS SINCERITY
201-127786-0040 AND I BEGAN IN SOME DEGREE TO RECOVER MYSELF I SAID TO HIM WITH MORE COURAGE THAN I THOUGHT I COULD HAVE POSSESSED
201-127786-0041 I HAVE MY SELF RESPECT AS MUCH AS YOU A LORD AND GENTLEMAN WITH ME YOUR VIOLENCE WILL BE TO NO PURPOSE YOUR WEALTH WILL HAVE NO WEIGHT YOUR WORDS WILL HAVE NO POWER TO DECEIVE ME NOR YOUR SIGHS OR TEARS TO SOFTEN ME
201-127786-0042 WERE I TO SEE ANY OF THE THINGS I SPEAK OF IN HIM WHOM MY PARENTS GAVE ME AS A HUSBAND HIS WILL SHOULD BE MINE AND MINE SHOULD BE BOUNDED BY HIS AND MY HONOUR BEING PRESERVED EVEN THOUGH MY INCLINATIONS WERE NOT
201-127786-0043 AND THIS I SAY LEST YOU SHOULD SUPPOSE THAT ANY BUT MY LAWFUL HUSBAND SHALL EVER WIN ANYTHING OF ME IF THAT
201-127786-0044 BE THE ONLY SCRUPLE YOU FEEL FAIREST DOROTHEA FOR THAT IS THE NAME OF THIS UNHAPPY BEING SEE HERE I GIVE YOU MY HAND TO BE YOURS AND LET HEAVEN
201-127786-0045 BUT HE WAS UNWILLING TO INTERRUPT THE STORY AND WISHED TO HEAR THE END OF WHAT HE ALREADY ALL BUT KNEW SO HE MERELY SAID WHAT
201-127786-0046 I HAVE HEARD OF ANOTHER OF THE SAME NAME WHO CAN PERHAPS MATCH YOUR MISFORTUNES BUT PROCEED BY AND BY I MAY TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT WILL ASTONISH YOU AS MUCH AS IT WILL EXCITE YOUR COMPASSION DOROTHEA WAS STRUCK BY CARDENIO'S WORDS AS WELL AS BY HIS STRANGE AND MISERABLE ATTIRE
201-127786-0047 AND BEGGED HIM IF HE KNEW ANYTHING CONCERNING HER TO TELL IT TO HER AT ONCE FOR IF FORTUNE HAD LEFT HER ANY BLESSING IT WAS COURAGE TO BEAR WHATEVER CALAMITY MIGHT FALL UPON HER AS SHE FELT SURE THAT NONE COULD REACH HER CAPABLE OF INCREASING IN ANY DEGREE WHAT SHE ENDURED ALREADY
201-127786-0048 I WOULD NOT LET THE OCCASION PASS SENORA REPLIED CARDENIO OF TELLING YOU WHAT I THINK
201-127786-0049 AND ONE OF HIS VASSALS I TOLD HIM NOT TO LET MY BEAUTY SUCH AS IT WAS BLIND HIM
201-127786-0050 FOR MARRIAGES SO UNEQUAL NEVER BROUGHT HAPPINESS NOR DID THEY CONTINUE LONG TO AFFORD THE ENJOYMENT THEY BEGAN WITH ALL THIS THAT I HAVE NOW REPEATED I SAID TO HIM AND MUCH MORE WHICH I CANNOT RECOLLECT BUT IT HAD NO EFFECT IN INDUCING HIM TO FOREGO HIS PURPOSE
201-127786-0051 AT THE SAME TIME I ARGUED THE MATTER BRIEFLY IN MY OWN MIND SAYING TO MYSELF I SHALL NOT BE THE FIRST WHO HAS RISEN THROUGH MARRIAGE FROM A LOWLY TO A LOFTY STATION NOR WILL DON FERNANDO BE THE FIRST WHOM BEAUTY OR AS IS MORE LIKELY A BLIND ATTACHMENT
201-127786-0052 HAS LED TO MATE HIMSELF BELOW HIS RANK THEN SINCE I AM INTRODUCING NO NEW USAGE OR PRACTICE
201-127786-0053 PASSED THROUGH MY MIND IN A MOMENT BUT THE OATHS OF DON FERNANDO THE WITNESSES HE APPEALED TO THE TEARS HE SHED AND LASTLY THE CHARMS OF HIS PERSON AND HIS HIGH BRED GRACE WHICH ACCOMPANIED BY SUCH SIGNS OF GENUINE LOVE
201-127786-0054 THESE WERE THE THINGS THAT MORE THAN ALL BEGAN TO INFLUENCE ME AND LEAD ME UNAWARES TO MY RUIN I CALLED MY WAITING MAID TO ME THAT THERE MIGHT BE A WITNESS ON EARTH BESIDES THOSE IN HEAVEN AND AGAIN DON FERNANDO RENEWED AND REPEATED HIS OATHS
201-127786-0055 CALLED DOWN UPON HIMSELF A THOUSAND CURSES HEREAFTER SHOULD HE FAIL TO KEEP HIS PROMISE SHED MORE TEARS REDOUBLED HIS SIGHS
201-127786-0056 AND SO I WAS LEFT BY MY MAID AND CEASED TO BE ONE AND HE BECAME A TRAITOR AND A PERJURED MAN THE DAY WHICH FOLLOWED THE NIGHT OF MY MISFORTUNE DID NOT COME SO QUICKLY I IMAGINE AS DON FERNANDO WISHED
201-127786-0057 WHO WAS INDEED THE ONE WHO HAD ADMITTED HIM GAINED THE STREET BEFORE DAYBREAK BUT ON TAKING LEAVE OF ME HE TOLD ME THOUGH NOT WITH AS MUCH EARNESTNESS AND FERVOUR AS WHEN HE CAME THAT I MIGHT REST ASSURED OF HIS FAITH AND OF THE SANCTITY AND SINCERITY OF HIS OATHS
201-127786-0058 AND TO CONFIRM HIS WORDS HE DREW A RICH RING OFF HIS FINGER AND PLACED IT UPON MINE HE THEN TOOK HIS DEPARTURE AND I WAS LEFT I KNOW NOT WHETHER SORROWFUL OR HAPPY ALL I CAN SAY IS I WAS LEFT AGITATED AND TROUBLED IN MIND AND ALMOST BEWILDERED BY WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE
201-127786-0059 AND I HAD NOT THE SPIRIT OR ELSE IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ME TO CHIDE MY MAID FOR THE TREACHERY SHE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF IN CONCEALING DON FERNANDO IN MY CHAMBER FOR AS YET I WAS UNABLE TO MAKE UP MY MIND WHETHER WHAT HAD BEFALLEN ME WAS FOR GOOD OR EVIL
201-127786-0060 I TOLD DON FERNANDO AT PARTING THAT AS I WAS NOW HIS HE MIGHT SEE ME ON OTHER NIGHTS IN THE SAME WAY UNTIL IT SHOULD BE HIS PLEASURE TO LET THE MATTER BECOME KNOWN BUT EXCEPT THE FOLLOWING NIGHT HE CAME NO MORE NOR FOR MORE THAN A MONTH COULD I CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HIM IN THE STREET OR IN CHURCH
201-127786-0061 WHILE I WEARIED MYSELF WITH WATCHING FOR ONE
201-127786-0062 I REMEMBER TOO HOW MY MAID HEARD THOSE WORDS IN REPROOF OF HER AUDACITY THAT SHE HAD NOT HEARD BEFORE AND HOW I WAS FORCED TO PUT A CONSTRAINT ON MY TEARS AND ON THE EXPRESSION OF MY COUNTENANCE NOT TO GIVE MY PARENTS CAUSE TO ASK ME WHY I WAS SO MELANCHOLY
201-127786-0063 AND DRIVE ME TO INVENT FALSEHOODS IN REPLY BUT ALL THIS WAS SUDDENLY BROUGHT TO AN END FOR THE TIME CAME WHEN ALL SUCH CONSIDERATIONS WERE DISREGARDED AND THERE WAS NO FURTHER QUESTION OF HONOUR WHEN MY PATIENCE GAVE WAY AND THE SECRET OF MY HEART BECAME KNOWN ABROAD
201-127786-0064 IT WAS SAID TOO THAT HER NAME WAS LUSCINDA AND THAT AT THE BETROTHAL SOME STRANGE THINGS HAD HAPPENED
201-127786-0065 DOROTHEA HOWEVER DID NOT INTERRUPT HER STORY BUT WENT ON IN THESE WORDS THIS SAD INTELLIGENCE REACHED MY EARS
201-127786-0066 AND WHOM I ENTREATED TO ACCOMPANY ME TO THE CITY WHERE I HEARD MY ENEMY WAS
201-127786-0067 AN AFFAIR OF SUCH NOTORIETY IN THE CITY THAT IT WAS THE TALK OF EVERY KNOT OF IDLERS IN THE STREET HE SAID THAT ON THE NIGHT OF DON FERNANDO'S BETROTHAL WITH LUSCINDA AS SOON AS SHE HAD CONSENTED TO BE HIS BRIDE BY SAYING YES SHE WAS TAKEN WITH A SUDDEN FAINTING FIT
201-127786-0068 AND THAT ON THE BRIDEGROOM APPROACHING TO UNLACE THE BOSOM OF HER DRESS TO GIVE HER AIR
201-127786-0069 ON SEEING THIS DON FERNANDO PERSUADED THAT LUSCINDA HAD BEFOOLED SLIGHTED AND TRIFLED WITH HIM ASSAILED HER BEFORE SHE HAD RECOVERED FROM HER SWOON AND TRIED TO STAB HER WITH THE DAGGER THAT HAD BEEN FOUND AND WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED HAD NOT HER PARENTS AND THOSE WHO WERE PRESENT PREVENTED HIM
201-127786-0070 IT WAS SAID MOREOVER THAT DON FERNANDO WENT AWAY AT ONCE AND THAT LUSCINDA DID NOT RECOVER FROM HER PROSTRATION UNTIL THE NEXT DAY WHEN SHE TOLD HER PARENTS HOW SHE WAS REALLY THE BRIDE OF THAT CARDENIO I HAVE MENTIONED I LEARNED BESIDES THAT CARDENIO
201-127786-0071 ACCORDING TO REPORT HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE BETROTHAL AND THAT UPON SEEING HER BETROTHED CONTRARY TO HIS EXPECTATION HE HAD QUITTED THE CITY IN DESPAIR LEAVING BEHIND HIM A LETTER DECLARING THE WRONG LUSCINDA HAD DONE HIM AND HIS INTENTION OF GOING WHERE NO ONE SHOULD EVER SEE HIM AGAIN
201-127786-0072 ALL THIS WAS A MATTER OF NOTORIETY IN THE CITY AND EVERYONE SPOKE OF IT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT LUSCINDA WAS MISSING FROM HER FATHER'S HOUSE AND FROM THE CITY FOR SHE WAS NOT TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE TO THE DISTRACTION OF HER PARENTS WHO KNEW NOT WHAT STEPS TO TAKE TO RECOVER HER WHAT I LEARNED
201-127786-0073 REVIVED MY HOPES AND I WAS BETTER PLEASED NOT TO HAVE FOUND DON FERNANDO THAN TO FIND HIM MARRIED FOR IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE DOOR WAS NOT YET ENTIRELY SHUT UPON RELIEF IN MY CASE AND I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HEAVEN HAD PUT THIS IMPEDIMENT IN THE WAY OF THE SECOND MARRIAGE
201-127786-0074 TO LEAD HIM TO RECOGNISE HIS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FORMER ONE AND REFLECT THAT AS A CHRISTIAN HE WAS BOUND TO CONSIDER HIS SOUL ABOVE ALL HUMAN OBJECTS ALL THIS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND AND I STROVE TO COMFORT MYSELF WITHOUT COMFORT
201-127786-0075 INDULGING IN FAINT AND DISTANT HOPES OF CHERISHING THAT LIFE THAT I NOW ABHOR BUT WHILE I WAS IN THE CITY UNCERTAIN WHAT TO DO AS I COULD NOT FIND DON FERNANDO I HEARD NOTICE GIVEN BY THE PUBLIC CRIER OFFERING A GREAT REWARD TO ANYONE WHO SHOULD FIND ME
201-127786-0076 AND GIVING THE PARTICULARS OF MY AGE AND OF THE VERY DRESS I WORE AND I HEARD IT SAID THAT THE LAD WHO CAME WITH ME HAD TAKEN ME AWAY FROM MY FATHER'S HOUSE A THING THAT CUT ME TO THE HEART SHOWING HOW LOW MY GOOD NAME HAD FALLEN SINCE IT WAS NOT ENOUGH THAT I SHOULD LOSE IT BY MY FLIGHT
201-127786-0077 BUT THEY MUST ADD WITH WHOM I HAD FLED AND THAT ONE SO MUCH BENEATH ME AND SO UNWORTHY OF MY CONSIDERATION THE INSTANT I HEARD THE NOTICE I QUITTED THE CITY WITH MY SERVANT WHO NOW BEGAN TO SHOW SIGNS OF WAVERING IN HIS FIDELITY TO ME AND THE SAME NIGHT FOR FEAR OF DISCOVERY
201-127786-0078 HE LAID ASIDE THE ENTREATIES WHICH HE HAD EMPLOYED AT FIRST AND BEGAN TO USE VIOLENCE BUT JUST HEAVEN THAT SELDOM FAILS TO WATCH OVER AND AID GOOD INTENTIONS SO AIDED MINE THAT WITH MY SLIGHT STRENGTH AND WITH LITTLE EXERTION
201-127786-0079 I PUSHED HIM OVER A PRECIPICE WHERE I LEFT HIM WHETHER DEAD OR ALIVE I KNOW NOT AND THEN WITH GREATER SPEED THAN SEEMED POSSIBLE IN MY TERROR AND FATIGUE I MADE MY WAY INTO THE MOUNTAINS WITHOUT ANY OTHER THOUGHT OR PURPOSE SAVE THAT OF HIDING MYSELF AMONG THEM AND ESCAPING MY FATHER
201-127786-0080 AND THOSE DESPATCHED IN SEARCH OF ME BY HIS ORDERS IT IS NOW I KNOW NOT HOW MANY MONTHS SINCE WITH THIS OBJECT I CAME HERE WHERE I MET A HERDSMAN WHO ENGAGED ME AS HIS SERVANT AT A PLACE IN THE HEART OF THIS SIERRA
201-127786-0081 BUT ALL MY CARE AND PAINS WERE UNAVAILING FOR MY MASTER MADE THE DISCOVERY THAT I WAS NOT A MAN AND HARBOURED THE SAME BASE DESIGNS AS MY SERVANT
2092-145706-0000 KLETKE THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME A MAN AND WOMAN WHO HAD THREE FINE LOOKING SONS BUT THEY WERE SO POOR THAT THEY HAD HARDLY ENOUGH FOOD FOR THEMSELVES LET ALONE THEIR CHILDREN
2092-145706-0001 OF HER AND THEIR FATHER THE THREE SET FORTH ON THEIR TRAVELS THE YOUNGEST OF THE THREE BROTHERS WHOSE NAME WAS FERKO WAS A BEAUTIFUL YOUTH WITH A SPLENDID FIGURE BLUE EYES FAIR HAIR
2092-145706-0002 AND A COMPLEXION LIKE MILK AND ROSES HIS TWO BROTHERS WERE AS JEALOUS OF HIM AS THEY COULD BE FOR THEY THOUGHT THAT WITH HIS GOOD LOOKS HE WOULD BE SURE TO BE MORE FORTUNATE THAN THEY WOULD EVER BE
2092-145706-0003 FOR THE SUN WAS HOT AND THEY WERE TIRED OF WALKING FERKO FELL FAST ASLEEP BUT THE OTHER TWO REMAINED AWAKE AND THE ELDEST SAID TO THE SECOND BROTHER WHAT DO YOU SAY TO DOING OUR BROTHER FERKO SOME HARM
2092-145706-0004 HE IS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT EVERYONE TAKES A FANCY TO HIM WHICH IS MORE THAN THEY DO TO US IF WE COULD ONLY GET HIM OUT OF THE WAY WE MIGHT SUCCEED BETTER I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU ANSWERED THE SECOND BROTHER
2092-145706-0005 AND MY ADVICE IS TO EAT UP HIS LOAF OF BREAD AND THEN TO REFUSE TO GIVE HIM A BIT OF OURS UNTIL HE HAS PROMISED TO LET US PUT OUT HIS EYES OR BREAK HIS LEGS HIS ELDEST BROTHER WAS DELIGHTED WITH THIS PROPOSAL
2092-145706-0006 AND THE TWO WICKED WRETCHES SEIZED FERKO'S LOAF AND ATE IT ALL UP WHILE THE POOR BOY WAS STILL ASLEEP WHEN HE DID AWAKE HE FELT VERY HUNGRY AND TURNED TO EAT HIS BREAD BUT HIS BROTHERS CRIED OUT
2092-145706-0007 YOU ATE YOUR LOAF IN YOUR SLEEP YOU GLUTTON AND YOU MAY STARVE AS LONG AS YOU LIKE BUT YOU WON'T GET A SCRAP OF OURS FERKO WAS AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND HOW HE COULD HAVE EATEN IN HIS SLEEP BUT HE SAID NOTHING
2092-145706-0008 AND FASTED ALL THAT DAY AND THE NEXT NIGHT BUT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING HE WAS SO HUNGRY THAT HE BURST INTO TEARS AND IMPLORED HIS BROTHERS TO GIVE HIM A LITTLE BIT OF THEIR BREAD
2092-145706-0009 AND BREAK ONE OF YOUR LEGS THEN WE WILL GIVE YOU A BIT OF OUR BREAD AT THESE WORDS POOR FERKO WEPT MORE BITTERLY THAN BEFORE AND BORE THE TORMENTS OF HUNGER TILL THE SUN WAS HIGH IN THE HEAVENS
2092-145706-0010 THEN HE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER AND HE CONSENTED TO ALLOW HIS LEFT EYE TO BE PUT OUT AND HIS LEFT LEG TO BE BROKEN WHEN THIS WAS DONE HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND EAGERLY FOR THE PIECE OF BREAD
2092-145706-0011 BUT HIS BROTHERS GAVE HIM SUCH A TINY SCRAP THAT THE STARVING YOUTH FINISHED IT IN A MOMENT AND BESOUGHT THEM FOR A SECOND BIT BUT THE MORE FERKO WEPT AND TOLD HIS BROTHERS THAT HE WAS DYING OF HUNGER
2092-145706-0012 THE MORE THEY LAUGHED AND SCOLDED HIM FOR HIS GREED SO HE ENDURED THE PANGS OF STARVATION ALL THAT DAY BUT WHEN NIGHT CAME HIS ENDURANCE GAVE WAY AND HE LET HIS RIGHT EYE BE PUT OUT
2092-145706-0013 AND HIS RIGHT LEG BROKEN FOR A SECOND PIECE OF BREAD AFTER HIS BROTHERS HAD THUS SUCCESSFULLY MAIMED AND DISFIGURED HIM FOR LIFE THEY LEFT HIM GROANING ON THE GROUND AND CONTINUED THEIR JOURNEY WITHOUT HIM
2092-145706-0014 POOR FERKO ATE UP THE SCRAP OF BREAD THEY HAD LEFT HIM AND WEPT BITTERLY BUT NO ONE HEARD HIM OR CAME TO HIS HELP NIGHT CAME ON AND THE POOR BLIND YOUTH HAD NO EYES TO CLOSE
2092-145706-0015 AND COULD ONLY CRAWL ALONG THE GROUND NOT KNOWING IN THE LEAST WHERE HE WAS GOING BUT WHEN THE SUN WAS ONCE MORE HIGH IN THE HEAVENS FERKO FELT THE BLAZING HEAT SCORCH HIM
2092-145706-0016 AND SOUGHT FOR SOME COOL SHADY PLACE TO REST HIS ACHING LIMBS HE CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF A HILL AND LAY DOWN IN THE GRASS AND AS HE THOUGHT UNDER THE SHADOW OF A BIG TREE
2092-145706-0017 IS THERE ANYTHING THE LEAST WONDERFUL OR REMARKABLE ABOUT THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD I SHOULD JUST THINK THERE WAS REPLIED THE OTHER MANY THINGS THAT DON'T EXIST ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD
2092-145706-0018 THERE IS A LAKE DOWN THERE BELOW US AND ANYONE WHO BATHES IN IT THOUGH HE WERE AT DEATH'S DOOR BECOMES SOUND AND WELL ON THE SPOT AND THOSE WHO WASH THEIR EYES WITH THE DEW ON THIS HILL
2092-145706-0019 BECOME AS SHARP SIGHTED AS THE EAGLE EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN BLIND FROM THEIR YOUTH WELL ANSWERED THE FIRST RAVEN MY EYES ARE IN NO WANT OF THIS HEALING BATH FOR HEAVEN BE PRAISED
2092-145706-0020 THEY ARE AS GOOD AS EVER THEY WERE BUT MY WING HAS BEEN VERY FEEBLE AND WEAK EVER SINCE IT WAS SHOT BY AN ARROW MANY YEARS AGO SO LET US FLY AT ONCE TO THE LAKE THAT I MAY BE RESTORED TO HEALTH AND STRENGTH AGAIN
2092-145706-0021 AND SO THEY FLEW AWAY THEIR WORDS REJOICED FERKO'S HEART AND HE WAITED IMPATIENTLY TILL EVENING SHOULD COME AND HE COULD RUB THE PRECIOUS DEW ON HIS SIGHTLESS EYES
2092-145706-0022 AT LAST IT BEGAN TO GROW DUSK AND THE SUN SANK BEHIND THE MOUNTAINS GRADUALLY IT BECAME COOLER ON THE HILL AND THE GRASS GREW WET WITH DEW THEN FERKO BURIED HIS FACE IN THE GROUND
2092-145706-0023 TILL HIS EYES WERE DAMP WITH DEWDROPS AND IN A MOMENT HE SAW CLEARER THAN HE HAD EVER DONE IN HIS LIFE BEFORE THE MOON WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY AND LIGHTED HIM TO THE LAKE WHERE HE COULD BATHE HIS POOR BROKEN LEGS
2092-145706-0024 THEN FERKO CRAWLED TO THE EDGE OF THE LAKE AND DIPPED HIS LIMBS IN THE WATER NO SOONER HAD HE DONE SO
2092-145706-0025 HE HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE HE MET A WOLF WHO WAS LIMPING DISCONSOLATELY ALONG ON THREE LEGS AND WHO ON PERCEIVING FERKO BEGAN TO HOWL DISMALLY MY GOOD FRIEND SAID THE YOUTH
2092-145706-0026 BE OF GOOD CHEER FOR I CAN SOON HEAL YOUR LEG AND WITH THESE WORDS HE POURED SOME OF THE PRECIOUS WATER OVER THE WOLF'S PAW AND IN A MINUTE THE ANIMAL WAS SPRINGING ABOUT SOUND AND WELL ON ALL FOURS
2092-145706-0027 THE GRATEFUL CREATURE THANKED HIS BENEFACTOR WARMLY AND PROMISED FERKO TO DO HIM A GOOD TURN IF HE SHOULD EVER NEED IT FERKO CONTINUED HIS WAY TILL HE CAME TO A PLOUGHED FIELD
2092-145706-0028 HERE HE NOTICED A LITTLE MOUSE CREEPING WEARILY ALONG ON ITS HIND PAWS FOR ITS FRONT PAWS HAD BOTH BEEN BROKEN IN A TRAP FERKO FELT SO SORRY FOR THE LITTLE BEAST
2092-145706-0029 THAT HE SPOKE TO IT IN THE MOST FRIENDLY MANNER AND WASHED ITS SMALL PAWS WITH THE HEALING WATER IN A MOMENT THE MOUSE WAS SOUND AND WHOLE AND AFTER THANKING THE KIND PHYSICIAN IT SCAMPERED AWAY OVER THE PLOUGHED FURROWS
2092-145706-0030 FERKO AGAIN PROCEEDED ON HIS JOURNEY BUT HE HADN'T GONE FAR BEFORE A QUEEN BEE FLEW AGAINST HIM TRAILING ONE WING BEHIND HER WHICH HAD BEEN CRUELLY TORN IN TWO BY A BIG BIRD
2092-145706-0031 FERKO WAS NO LESS WILLING TO HELP HER THAN HE HAD BEEN TO HELP THE WOLF AND THE MOUSE SO HE POURED SOME HEALING DROPS OVER THE WOUNDED WING ON THE SPOT THE QUEEN BEE WAS CURED AND TURNING TO FERKO SHE SAID
2092-145706-0032 I AM MOST GRATEFUL FOR YOUR KINDNESS AND SHALL REWARD YOU SOME DAY AND WITH THESE WORDS SHE FLEW AWAY HUMMING GAILY THEN FERKO WANDERED ON FOR MANY A LONG DAY
2092-145706-0033 AND AT LENGTH REACHED A STRANGE KINGDOM HERE HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF HE MIGHT AS WELL GO STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE AND OFFER HIS SERVICES TO THE KING OF THE COUNTRY FOR HE HAD HEARD THAT THE KING'S DAUGHTER
2092-145706-0034 THEY HAD MANAGED TO OBTAIN PLACES IN THE KING'S SERVICE AND WHEN THEY RECOGNISED FERKO WITH HIS EYES AND LEGS SOUND AND WELL THEY WERE FRIGHTENED TO DEATH FOR THEY FEARED HE WOULD TELL THE KING OF THEIR CONDUCT
2092-145706-0035 FOR SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE SO HANDSOME IN HER LIFE BEFORE HIS BROTHERS NOTICED THIS AND ENVY AND JEALOUSY WERE ADDED TO THEIR FEAR SO MUCH SO THAT THEY DETERMINED ONCE MORE TO DESTROY HIM
2092-145706-0036 THEY WENT TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM THAT FERKO WAS A WICKED MAGICIAN WHO HAD COME TO THE PALACE WITH THE INTENTION OF CARRYING OFF THE PRINCESS THEN THE KING HAD FERKO BROUGHT BEFORE HIM AND SAID
2092-145706-0037 YOU ARE ACCUSED OF BEING A MAGICIAN WHO WISHES TO ROB ME OF MY DAUGHTER AND I CONDEMN YOU TO DEATH BUT IF YOU CAN FULFIL THREE TASKS WHICH I SHALL SET YOU TO DO YOUR LIFE SHALL BE SPARED
2092-145706-0038 ON CONDITION YOU LEAVE THE COUNTRY BUT IF YOU CANNOT PERFORM WHAT I DEMAND YOU SHALL BE HUNG ON THE NEAREST TREE AND TURNING TO THE TWO WICKED BROTHERS HE SAID SUGGEST SOMETHING FOR HIM TO DO
2092-145706-0039 NO MATTER HOW DIFFICULT HE MUST SUCCEED IN IT OR DIE THEY DID NOT THINK LONG BUT REPLIED LET HIM BUILD YOUR MAJESTY IN ONE DAY A MORE BEAUTIFUL PALACE THAN THIS AND IF HE FAILS IN THE ATTEMPT
2092-145706-0040 LET HIM BE HUNG THE KING WAS PLEASED WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND COMMANDED FERKO TO SET TO WORK ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE TWO BROTHERS WERE DELIGHTED FOR THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD NOW GOT RID OF FERKO FOR EVER
2092-145706-0041 AS HE WAS WANDERING DISCONSOLATELY ABOUT THE MEADOWS ROUND THE PALACE WONDERING HOW HE COULD ESCAPE BEING PUT TO DEATH A LITTLE BEE FLEW PAST AND SETTLING ON HIS SHOULDER WHISPERED IN HIS EAR
2092-145706-0042 WHAT IS TROUBLING YOU MY KIND BENEFACTOR CAN I BE OF ANY HELP TO YOU I AM THE BEE WHOSE WING YOU HEALED
2092-145706-0043 A PALACE SHALL BE BUILT UNLIKE ANY THAT KING HAS DWELT IN BEFORE JUST STAY HERE TILL I COME AGAIN AND TELL YOU THAT IT IS FINISHED HAVING SAID THIS SHE FLEW MERRILY AWAY AND FERKO
2092-145706-0044 BE OF GOOD CHEER AND LEAD THE KING TO THE HILL JUST OUTSIDE THE CITY WALLS AND HUMMING GAILY SHE FLEW AWAY AGAIN FERKO WENT AT ONCE TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM THE PALACE WAS FINISHED
2092-145706-0045 THE WHOLE COURT WENT OUT TO SEE THE WONDER AND THEIR ASTONISHMENT WAS GREAT AT THE SIGHT WHICH MET THEIR EYES A SPLENDID PALACE REARED ITSELF ON THE HILL JUST OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF THE CITY MADE OF THE MOST EXQUISITE FLOWERS
2092-145706-0046 WITH SUNFLOWERS FOR KNOCKERS AND ALL ROUND HYACINTHS AND OTHER SWEET SMELLING FLOWERS BLOOMED IN MASSES SO THAT THE AIR WAS PERFUMED FAR AND NEAR AND ENCHANTED ALL WHO WERE PRESENT
2092-145706-0047 THIS SPLENDID PALACE HAD BEEN BUILT BY THE GRATEFUL QUEEN BEE WHO HAD SUMMONED ALL THE OTHER BEES IN THE KINGDOM TO HELP HER THE KING'S AMAZEMENT KNEW NO BOUNDS AND THE PRINCESS'S EYES BEAMED WITH DELIGHT
2092-145706-0048 ON THE DELIGHTED FERKO BUT THE TWO BROTHERS HAD GROWN QUITE GREEN WITH ENVY AND ONLY DECLARED THE MORE THAT FERKO WAS NOTHING BUT A WICKED MAGICIAN
2092-145706-0049 THE KING ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN SURPRISED AND ASTONISHED AT THE WAY HIS COMMANDS HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT WAS VERY VEXED
2092-145706-0050 AND TURNING TO THE TWO BROTHERS HE SAID HE HAS CERTAINLY ACCOMPLISHED THE FIRST TASK WITH THE AID NO DOUBT OF HIS DIABOLICAL MAGIC BUT WHAT SHALL WE GIVE HIM TO DO NOW
2092-145706-0051 LET US MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE AND IF HE FAILS HE SHALL DIE THEN THE ELDEST BROTHER REPLIED THE CORN HAS ALL BEEN CUT BUT IT HAS NOT YET BEEN PUT INTO BARNS
2092-145706-0052 LET THE KNAVE COLLECT ALL THE GRAIN IN THE KINGDOM INTO ONE BIG HEAP BEFORE TO MORROW NIGHT AND IF AS MUCH AS A STALK OF CORN IS LEFT LET HIM BE PUT TO DEATH
2092-145706-0053 THE PRINCESS GREW WHITE WITH TERROR WHEN SHE HEARD THESE WORDS BUT FERKO FELT MUCH MORE CHEERFUL THAN HE HAD DONE THE FIRST TIME AND WANDERED OUT INTO THE MEADOWS AGAIN
2092-145706-0054 BUT HE COULD THINK OF NO WAY OF ESCAPE THE SUN SANK TO REST AND NIGHT CAME ON WHEN A LITTLE MOUSE STARTED OUT OF THE GRASS AT FERKO'S FEET AND SAID TO HIM I'M DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU
2092-145706-0055 MY KIND BENEFACTOR BUT WHY ARE YOU LOOKING SO SAD CAN I BE OF ANY HELP TO YOU AND THUS REPAY YOUR GREAT KINDNESS TO ME THEN FERKO RECOGNISED THE MOUSE WHOSE FRONT PAWS HE HAD HEALED AND REPLIED
2092-145706-0056 BEFORE TO MORROW NIGHT ALL THE GRAIN IN THE KINGDOM HAS TO BE GATHERED INTO ONE BIG HEAP AND IF AS MUCH AS A STALK OF CORN IS WANTING I MUST PAY FOR IT WITH MY LIFE IS THAT ALL ANSWERED THE MOUSE
2092-145706-0057 THAT NEEDN'T DISTRESS YOU MUCH JUST TRUST IN ME AND BEFORE THE SUN SETS AGAIN YOU SHALL HEAR THAT YOUR TASK IS DONE AND WITH THESE WORDS THE LITTLE CREATURE SCAMPERED AWAY INTO THE FIELDS
2092-145706-0058 FERKO WHO NEVER DOUBTED THAT THE MOUSE WOULD BE AS GOOD AS ITS WORD LAY DOWN COMFORTED ON THE SOFT GRASS AND SLEPT SOUNDLY TILL NEXT MORNING THE DAY PASSED SLOWLY
2092-145706-0059 AND THE WHOLE COURT WENT OUT TO SEE THE WONDER
2092-145706-0060 FOR IN A HEAP HIGHER THAN THE KING'S PALACE LAY ALL THE GRAIN OF THE COUNTRY AND NOT A SINGLE STALK OF CORN HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND IN ANY OF THE FIELDS AND HOW HAD ALL THIS BEEN DONE
2092-145706-0061 THE LITTLE MOUSE HAD SUMMONED EVERY OTHER MOUSE IN THE LAND TO ITS HELP AND TOGETHER THEY HAD COLLECTED ALL THE GRAIN IN THE KINGDOM THE KING COULD NOT HIDE HIS AMAZEMENT BUT AT THE SAME TIME HIS WRATH INCREASED
2092-145706-0062 AND HE WAS MORE READY THAN EVER TO BELIEVE THE TWO BROTHERS WHO KEPT ON REPEATING
2092-145706-0063 THAN A WICKED MAGICIAN ONLY THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS REJOICED OVER FERKO'S SUCCESS AND LOOKED ON HIM WITH FRIENDLY GLANCES WHICH THE YOUTH RETURNED THE MORE THE CRUEL KING GAZED ON THE WONDER BEFORE HIM
2092-145706-0064 THE MORE ANGRY HE BECAME FOR HE COULD NOT IN THE FACE OF HIS PROMISE PUT THE STRANGER TO DEATH HE TURNED ONCE MORE TO THE TWO BROTHERS AND SAID HIS DIABOLICAL MAGIC HAS HELPED HIM AGAIN
2092-145706-0065 BUT NOW WHAT THIRD TASK SHALL WE SET HIM TO DO NO MATTER HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS HE MUST DO IT OR DIE THE ELDEST ANSWERED QUICKLY LET HIM DRIVE ALL THE WOLVES OF THE KINGDOM ON TO THIS HILL
2092-145706-0066 BEFORE TO MORROW NIGHT IF HE DOES THIS HE MAY GO FREE IF NOT HE SHALL BE HUNG AS YOU HAVE SAID AT THESE WORDS THE PRINCESS BURST INTO TEARS
2092-145706-0067 AND WHEN THE KING SAW THIS HE ORDERED HER TO BE SHUT UP IN A HIGH TOWER AND CAREFULLY GUARDED TILL THE DANGEROUS MAGICIAN SHOULD EITHER HAVE LEFT THE KINGDOM OR BEEN HUNG ON THE NEAREST TREE FERKO WANDERED OUT INTO THE FIELDS AGAIN
2092-145706-0068 AND SAT DOWN ON THE STUMP OF A TREE WONDERING WHAT HE SHOULD DO NEXT SUDDENLY A BIG WOLF RAN UP TO HIM AND STANDING STILL SAID I'M VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN MY KIND BENEFACTOR
2092-145706-0069 WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT ALL ALONE BY YOURSELF IF I CAN HELP YOU IN ANY WAY ONLY SAY THE WORD FOR I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU A PROOF OF MY GRATITUDE FERKO AT ONCE RECOGNISED THE WOLF
2092-145706-0070 WHOSE BROKEN LEG HE HAD HEALED AND TOLD HIM WHAT HE HAD TO DO THE FOLLOWING DAY IF HE WISHED TO ESCAPE WITH HIS LIFE BUT HOW IN THE WORLD HE ADDED AM I TO COLLECT ALL THE WOLVES OF THE KINGDOM ON TO THAT HILL OVER THERE
2092-145706-0071 IF THAT'S ALL YOU WANT DONE ANSWERED THE WOLF YOU NEEDN'T WORRY YOURSELF I'LL UNDERTAKE THE TASK AND YOU'LL HEAR FROM ME AGAIN BEFORE SUNSET TO MORROW
2092-145706-0072 AND WITH THESE WORDS HE TROTTED QUICKLY AWAY THEN THE YOUTH REJOICED GREATLY FOR NOW HE FELT THAT HIS LIFE WAS SAFE BUT HE GREW VERY SAD WHEN HE THOUGHT OF THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS
2092-145706-0073 AND THAT HE WOULD NEVER SEE HER AGAIN IF HE LEFT THE COUNTRY HE LAY DOWN ONCE MORE ON THE GRASS AND SOON FELL FAST ASLEEP ALL THE NEXT DAY HE SPENT WANDERING ABOUT THE FIELDS
2092-145706-0074 THEN RETURN AT ONCE TO ME AND GET ON MY BACK AND I WILL HELP YOU TO DRIVE ALL THE WOLVES TOGETHER THEN FERKO WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE AND TOLD THE KING THAT HE WAS READY TO PERFORM THE THIRD TASK IF HE WOULD COME TO THE HILL AND SEE IT DONE
2092-145706-0075 FERKO HIMSELF RETURNED TO THE FIELDS AND MOUNTING ON THE WOLF'S BACK HE RODE TO THE WOOD CLOSE BY QUICK AS LIGHTNING THE WOLF FLEW ROUND THE WOOD AND IN A MINUTE MANY HUNDRED WOLVES ROSE UP BEFORE HIM
2092-145706-0076 INCREASING IN NUMBER EVERY MOMENT TILL THEY COULD BE COUNTED BY THOUSANDS HE DROVE THEM ALL BEFORE HIM ON TO THE HILL WHERE THE KING AND HIS WHOLE COURT AND FERKO'S TWO BROTHERS WERE STANDING ONLY THE LOVELY PRINCESS WAS NOT PRESENT
2092-145706-0077 FOR SHE WAS SHUT UP IN HER TOWER WEEPING BITTERLY THE WICKED BROTHERS STAMPED AND FOAMED WITH RAGE WHEN THEY SAW THE FAILURE OF THEIR WICKED DESIGNS BUT THE KING WAS OVERCOME BY A SUDDEN TERROR
2092-145706-0078 WHEN HE SAW THE ENORMOUS PACK OF WOLVES APPROACHING NEARER AND NEARER AND CALLING OUT TO FERKO HE SAID ENOUGH ENOUGH WE DON'T WANT ANY MORE BUT THE WOLF ON WHOSE BACK FERKO SAT SAID TO ITS RIDER
2092-145706-0079 GO ON GO ON AND AT THE SAME MOMENT MANY MORE WOLVES RAN UP THE HILL HOWLING HORRIBLY AND SHOWING THEIR WHITE TEETH THE KING IN HIS TERROR CALLED OUT STOP A MOMENT I WILL GIVE YOU HALF MY KINGDOM
2092-145706-0080 IF YOU WILL DRIVE ALL THE WOLVES AWAY BUT FERKO PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR AND DROVE SOME MORE THOUSANDS BEFORE HIM SO THAT EVERYONE QUAKED WITH HORROR AND FEAR THEN THE KING RAISED HIS VOICE AGAIN AND CALLED OUT
2092-145706-0081 STOP YOU SHALL HAVE MY WHOLE KINGDOM IF YOU WILL ONLY DRIVE THESE WOLVES BACK TO THE PLACES THEY CAME FROM BUT THE WOLF KEPT ON ENCOURAGING FERKO AND SAID GO ON GO ON SO HE LED THE WOLVES ON
2092-145706-0082 TILL AT LAST THEY FELL ON THE KING AND ON THE WICKED BROTHERS AND ATE THEM AND THE WHOLE COURT UP IN A MOMENT THEN FERKO WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE AND SET THE PRINCESS FREE AND ON THE SAME DAY
2092-145706-0083 HE MARRIED HER AND WAS CROWNED KING OF THE COUNTRY AND THE WOLVES ALL WENT PEACEFULLY BACK TO THEIR OWN HOMES AND FERKO AND HIS BRIDE LIVED FOR MANY YEARS IN PEACE AND HAPPINESS TOGETHER
2092-145709-0000 KLETKE ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WERE THREE PRINCESSES WHO WERE ALL THREE YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL BUT THE YOUNGEST ALTHOUGH SHE WAS NOT FAIRER THAN THE OTHER TWO WAS THE MOST LOVEABLE OF THEM ALL
2092-145709-0001 ABOUT HALF A MILE FROM THE PALACE IN WHICH THEY LIVED THERE STOOD A CASTLE WHICH WAS UNINHABITED AND ALMOST A RUIN BUT THE GARDEN WHICH SURROUNDED IT WAS A MASS OF BLOOMING FLOWERS
2092-145709-0002 AND IN THIS GARDEN THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS USED OFTEN TO WALK ONE DAY WHEN SHE WAS PACING TO AND FRO UNDER THE LIME TREES A BLACK CROW HOPPED OUT OF A ROSE BUSH IN FRONT OF HER
2092-145709-0003 THE POOR BEAST WAS ALL TORN AND BLEEDING AND THE KIND LITTLE PRINCESS WAS QUITE UNHAPPY ABOUT IT WHEN THE CROW SAW THIS IT TURNED TO HER AND SAID I AM NOT REALLY A BLACK CROW
2092-145709-0004 BUT AN ENCHANTED PRINCE WHO HAS BEEN DOOMED TO SPEND HIS YOUTH IN MISERY IF YOU ONLY LIKED PRINCESS YOU COULD SAVE ME BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO SAY GOOD BYE TO ALL YOUR OWN PEOPLE
2092-145709-0005 AND COME AND BE MY CONSTANT COMPANION IN THIS RUINED CASTLE THERE IS ONE HABITABLE ROOM IN IT IN WHICH THERE IS A GOLDEN BED THERE YOU WILL HAVE TO LIVE ALL BY YOURSELF
2092-145709-0006 AND DON'T FORGET THAT WHATEVER YOU MAY SEE OR HEAR IN THE NIGHT YOU MUST NOT SCREAM OUT FOR IF YOU GIVE AS MUCH AS A SINGLE CRY MY SUFFERINGS WILL BE DOUBLED
2092-145709-0007 THE GOOD NATURED PRINCESS AT ONCE LEFT HER HOME AND HER FAMILY AND HURRIED TO THE RUINED CASTLE AND TOOK POSSESSION OF THE ROOM WITH THE GOLDEN BED
2092-145709-0008 WHEN NIGHT APPROACHED SHE LAY DOWN BUT THOUGH SHE SHUT HER EYES TIGHT SLEEP WOULD NOT COME AT MIDNIGHT SHE HEARD TO HER GREAT HORROR SOME ONE COMING ALONG THE PASSAGE AND IN A MINUTE
2092-145709-0009 HER DOOR WAS FLUNG WIDE OPEN AND A TROOP OF STRANGE BEINGS ENTERED THE ROOM THEY AT ONCE PROCEEDED TO LIGHT A FIRE IN THE HUGE FIREPLACE THEN THEY PLACED A GREAT CAULDRON OF BOILING WATER ON IT
2092-145709-0010 WHEN THEY HAD DONE THIS THEY APPROACHED THE BED ON WHICH THE TREMBLING GIRL LAY AND SCREAMING AND YELLING ALL THE TIME THEY DRAGGED HER TOWARDS THE CAULDRON SHE NEARLY DIED WITH FRIGHT
2092-145709-0011 BUT SHE NEVER UTTERED A SOUND THEN OF A SUDDEN THE COCK CREW AND ALL THE EVIL SPIRITS VANISHED AT THE SAME MOMENT THE CROW APPEARED AND HOPPED ALL ROUND THE ROOM WITH JOY
2092-145709-0012 IT THANKED THE PRINCESS MOST HEARTILY FOR HER GOODNESS AND SAID THAT ITS SUFFERINGS HAD ALREADY BEEN GREATLY LESSENED NOW ONE OF THE PRINCESS'S ELDER SISTERS WHO WAS VERY INQUISITIVE
2092-145709-0013 THAT AT LAST THE GOOD NATURED LITTLE PRINCESS CONSENTED BUT AT MIDNIGHT WHEN THE ODD FOLK APPEARED THE ELDER SISTER SCREAMED WITH TERROR AND FROM THIS TIME ON THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS
2092-145709-0014 INSISTED ALWAYS ON KEEPING WATCH ALONE SO SHE LIVED IN SOLITUDE ALL THE DAYTIME AND AT NIGHT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN FRIGHTENED HAD SHE NOT BEEN SO BRAVE BUT EVERY DAY
2092-145709-0015 THE CROW CAME AND THANKED HER FOR HER ENDURANCE AND ASSURED HER THAT HIS SUFFERINGS WERE FAR LESS THAN THEY HAD BEEN AND SO TWO YEARS PASSED AWAY WHEN ONE DAY THE CROW CAME TO THE PRINCESS AND SAID
2092-145709-0016 IN ANOTHER YEAR I SHALL BE FREED FROM THE SPELL I AM UNDER AT PRESENT BECAUSE THEN THE SEVEN YEARS WILL BE OVER BUT BEFORE I CAN RESUME MY NATURAL FORM
2092-145709-0017 AND TAKE POSSESSION OF THE BELONGINGS OF MY FOREFATHERS YOU MUST GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TAKE SERVICE AS A MAIDSERVANT THE YOUNG PRINCESS CONSENTED AT ONCE AND FOR A WHOLE YEAR
2092-145709-0018 AND HAD WORKED HER LITTLE WHITE HANDS WEARY SHE HEARD A RUSTLING BESIDE HER AND A CRY OF JOY THEN SHE SAW A HANDSOME YOUTH STANDING BESIDE HER WHO KNELT DOWN AT HER FEET
2092-145709-0019 AND KISSED THE LITTLE WEARY WHITE HANDS I AM THE PRINCE HE SAID WHO YOU IN YOUR GOODNESS WHEN I WAS WANDERING ABOUT IN THE SHAPE OF A BLACK CROW FREED FROM THE MOST AWFUL TORMENTS
2092-145709-0020 COME NOW TO MY CASTLE WITH ME AND LET US LIVE THERE HAPPILY TOGETHER SO THEY WENT TO THE CASTLE WHERE THEY HAD BOTH ENDURED SO MUCH
2092-145709-0021 IT WAS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS THE SAME FOR IT HAD ALL BEEN REBUILT AND DONE UP AGAIN
211-122425-0000 DO YOU KNOW THAT HIS EMINENCE HAS BEEN MAKING FRESH COMPLAINTS AGAINST YOUR MUSKETEERS
211-122425-0001 AH THESE MUSKETEERS OF YOURS ARE VERY DEVILS FELLOWS TO BE HANGED NO SIRE REPLIED TREVILLE WHO SAW AT THE FIRST GLANCE HOW THINGS WOULD GO ON THE CONTRARY THEY ARE GOOD CREATURES AS MEEK AS LAMBS AND HAVE BUT ONE DESIRE
211-122425-0002 I'LL BE THEIR WARRANTY AND THAT IS THAT THEIR SWORDS MAY NEVER LEAVE THEIR SCABBARDS BUT IN YOUR MAJESTY'S SERVICE BUT WHAT ARE THEY TO DO
211-122425-0003 WOULD NOT ONE SAY HE WAS SPEAKING OF A RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY IN TRUTH MY DEAR CAPTAIN
211-122425-0004 AND BY AND BY BY AND BY WE WILL SEE AH SIRE IT IS BECAUSE I CONFIDE IN THAT JUSTICE THAT I SHALL WAIT PATIENTLY AND QUIETLY THE GOOD PLEASURE OF YOUR MAJESTY
211-122425-0005 THE KING THEREFORE AROSE A MINUTE AFTER AND PUTTING THE MONEY WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM INTO HIS POCKET
211-122425-0006 LA VIEUVILLE SAID HE TAKE MY PLACE
211-122425-0007 AH I HAD EIGHTY LOUIS BEFORE ME PUT DOWN THE SAME SUM SO THAT THEY WHO HAVE LOST MAY HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF JUSTICE BEFORE EVERYTHING
211-122425-0008 YES SIRE AS THEY ALWAYS DO AND HOW DID THE THING HAPPEN LET US SEE FOR YOU KNOW MY DEAR CAPTAIN A JUDGE MUST HEAR BOTH SIDES GOOD LORD IN THE MOST SIMPLE AND NATURAL MANNER POSSIBLE
211-122425-0009 AND WHO HAVE I DARE AFFIRM TO THE KING HIS SERVICE MUCH AT HEART THREE OF MY BEST SOLDIERS I SAY
211-122425-0010 HAD MADE A PARTY OF PLEASURE WITH A YOUNG FELLOW FROM GASCONY WHOM I HAD INTRODUCED TO THEM THE SAME MORNING THE PARTY WAS TO TAKE PLACE AT SAINT GERMAIN I BELIEVE AND THEY HAD APPOINTED TO MEET AT THE CARMES DESCHAUX WHEN THEY WERE DISTURBED BY DE JUSSAC CAHUSAC
211-122425-0011 WHO CERTAINLY DID NOT GO THERE IN SUCH A NUMEROUS COMPANY WITHOUT SOME ILL INTENTION AGAINST THE EDICTS AH AH YOU INCLINE ME TO THINK SO SAID THE KING THERE IS NO DOUBT THEY WENT THITHER TO FIGHT THEMSELVES I DO NOT ACCUSE THEM SIRE
211-122425-0012 BUT I LEAVE YOUR MAJESTY TO JUDGE WHAT FIVE ARMED MEN COULD POSSIBLY BE GOING TO DO IN SUCH A DESERTED PLACE AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD
211-122425-0013 THEN UPON SEEING MY MUSKETEERS THEY CHANGED THEIR MINDS AND FORGOT THEIR PRIVATE HATRED FOR PARTISAN HATRED FOR YOUR MAJESTY CANNOT BE IGNORANT THAT THE MUSKETEERS WHO BELONG TO THE KING AND NOBODY BUT THE KING
211-122425-0014 ARE THE NATURAL ENEMIES OF THE GUARDSMEN WHO BELONG TO THE CARDINAL YES TREVILLE YES SAID THE KING IN A MELANCHOLY TONE AND IT IS VERY SAD BELIEVE ME TO SEE THUS TWO PARTIES IN FRANCE TWO HEADS TO ROYALTY
211-122425-0015 BUT I WILL NOT SWEAR TO IT SIRE YOU KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH AND UNLESS A MAN BE ENDOWED WITH THAT ADMIRABLE INSTINCT
211-122425-0016 YOU ARE RIGHT TREVILLE BUT THEY WERE NOT ALONE YOUR MUSKETEERS THEY HAD A YOUTH WITH THEM YES SIRE AND ONE WOUNDED MAN SO THAT THREE OF THE KING'S MUSKETEERS ONE OF WHOM WAS WOUNDED
211-122425-0017 AND A YOUTH NOT ONLY MAINTAINED THEIR GROUND AGAINST FIVE OF THE MOST TERRIBLE OF THE CARDINAL'S GUARDSMEN BUT ABSOLUTELY BROUGHT FOUR OF THEM TO EARTH WHY THIS IS A VICTORY CRIED THE KING ALL RADIANT A COMPLETE VICTORY
211-122425-0018 ONE HARDLY A YOUNG MAN BUT WHO HOWEVER BEHAVED HIMSELF SO ADMIRABLY ON THIS OCCASION THAT I WILL TAKE THE LIBERTY OF RECOMMENDING HIM TO YOUR MAJESTY HOW DOES HE CALL HIMSELF D'ARTAGNAN SIRE
211-122425-0019 HE IS THE SON OF ONE OF MY OLDEST FRIENDS THE SON OF A MAN WHO SERVED UNDER THE KING YOUR FATHER OF GLORIOUS MEMORY IN THE CIVIL WAR AND YOU SAY THIS YOUNG MAN BEHAVED HIMSELF WELL TELL ME HOW TREVILLE YOU KNOW HOW I DELIGHT IN ACCOUNTS OF WAR AND FIGHTING
211-122425-0020 PLACING HIS HAND UPON HIS HIP SIRE RESUMED TREVILLE AS I TOLD YOU
211-122425-0021 HE WAS DRESSED AS A CITIZEN THE GUARDS OF THE CARDINAL PERCEIVING HIS YOUTH AND THAT HE DID NOT BELONG TO THE CORPS INVITED HIM TO RETIRE BEFORE THEY ATTACKED SO YOU MAY PLAINLY SEE TREVILLE INTERRUPTED THE KING IT WAS THEY WHO ATTACKED
211-122425-0022 THAT IS TRUE SIRE THERE CAN BE NO MORE DOUBT ON THAT HEAD THEY CALLED UPON HIM THEN TO RETIRE BUT HE ANSWERED THAT HE WAS A MUSKETEER AT HEART ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO YOUR MAJESTY
211-122425-0023 BRAVE YOUNG MAN MURMURED THE KING WELL HE DID REMAIN WITH THEM AND YOUR MAJESTY HAS IN HIM SO FIRM A CHAMPION THAT IT WAS HE WHO GAVE JUSSAC THE TERRIBLE SWORD THRUST WHICH HAS MADE THE CARDINAL SO ANGRY
211-122425-0024 HE WHO WOUNDED JUSSAC CRIED THE KING HE A BOY
211-122425-0025 IT IS AS I HAVE THE HONOR TO RELATE IT TO YOUR MAJESTY JUSSAC ONE OF THE FIRST SWORDSMEN IN THE KINGDOM WELL SIRE FOR ONCE HE FOUND HIS MASTER I WILL SEE THIS YOUNG MAN TREVILLE I WILL SEE HIM AND IF ANYTHING CAN BE DONE
211-122425-0026 IT IS USELESS TO LET THE CARDINAL KNOW YES SIRE YOU UNDERSTAND TREVILLE AN EDICT IS STILL AN EDICT IT IS FORBIDDEN TO FIGHT AFTER ALL BUT THIS ENCOUNTER SIRE IS QUITE OUT OF THE ORDINARY CONDITIONS OF A DUEL IT IS A BRAWL
211-122425-0027 THAT IS TRUE SAID THE KING BUT NEVER MIND TREVILLE COME STILL BY THE BACK STAIRCASE TREVILLE SMILED BUT AS IT WAS INDEED SOMETHING TO HAVE PREVAILED UPON THIS CHILD TO REBEL AGAINST HIS MASTER
211-122425-0028 HE SALUTED THE KING RESPECTFULLY AND WITH THIS AGREEMENT TOOK LEAVE OF HIM THAT EVENING THE THREE MUSKETEERS WERE INFORMED OF THE HONOR ACCORDED THEM AS THEY HAD LONG BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH THE KING THEY WERE NOT MUCH EXCITED
211-122425-0029 BUT D'ARTAGNAN WITH HIS GASCON IMAGINATION SAW IN IT HIS FUTURE FORTUNE AND PASSED THE NIGHT IN GOLDEN DREAMS
211-122425-0030 D'ARTAGNAN FOUND THE MUSKETEER DRESSED AND READY TO GO OUT AS THE HOUR TO WAIT UPON THE KING WAS NOT TILL TWELVE HE HAD MADE A PARTY WITH PORTHOS AND ARAMIS TO PLAY A GAME AT TENNIS
211-122425-0031 AND ALTHOUGH IGNORANT OF THE GAME WHICH HE HAD NEVER PLAYED HE ACCEPTED NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH HIS TIME FROM NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AS IT THEN SCARCELY WAS TILL TWELVE THE TWO MUSKETEERS WERE ALREADY THERE AND WERE PLAYING TOGETHER
211-122425-0032 ALTHOUGH HE PLAYED WITH HIS LEFT HAND HE FOUND THAT HIS WOUND WAS YET TOO RECENT TO ALLOW OF SUCH EXERTION
211-122425-0033 AND AS HE DECLARED HE WAS TOO IGNORANT OF THE GAME TO PLAY IT REGULARLY THEY ONLY CONTINUED GIVING BALLS TO ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT COUNTING
211-122425-0034 PASSED SO CLOSE TO D'ARTAGNAN'S FACE
211-122425-0035 HIS AUDIENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN PROBABLY LOST AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE KING NOW AS UPON THIS AUDIENCE IN HIS GASCON IMAGINATION DEPENDED HIS FUTURE LIFE HE SALUTED ARAMIS AND PORTHOS POLITELY
211-122425-0036 DECLARING THAT HE WOULD NOT RESUME THE GAME UNTIL HE SHOULD BE PREPARED TO PLAY WITH THEM ON MORE EQUAL TERMS
211-122425-0037 LOOK AT ME AS LONG AS YOU LIKE MY LITTLE GENTLEMAN I HAVE SAID WHAT I HAVE SAID
211-122425-0038 YOU'RE IN THE WRONG THERE FOR IF YOU KNEW MY NAME PERHAPS YOU WOULD NOT BE SO PRESSING WHAT IS YOUR NAME
211-122425-0039 LEST IT BE OBSERVED THAT WE GO OUT TOGETHER YOU MUST BE AWARE THAT FOR OUR UNDERTAKING COMPANY WOULD BE IN THE WAY THAT'S TRUE SAID THE GUARDSMAN ASTONISHED THAT HIS NAME HAD NOT PRODUCED MORE EFFECT UPON THE YOUNG MAN
211-122425-0040 THAT THEY DID NOT EVEN PERCEIVE THEIR YOUNG COMPANION GO OUT WHO AS HE HAD TOLD THE GUARDSMAN OF HIS EMINENCE STOPPED OUTSIDE THE DOOR AN INSTANT AFTER THE GUARDSMAN DESCENDED IN HIS TURN
211-122425-0041 WHICH WAS FIXED FOR MIDDAY HE CAST HIS EYES AROUND AND SEEING THAT THE STREET WAS EMPTY SAID TO HIS ADVERSARY MY FAITH IT IS FORTUNATE FOR YOU ALTHOUGH YOUR NAME IS BERNAJOUX TO HAVE ONLY TO DEAL WITH AN APPRENTICE MUSKETEER
211-122425-0042 NEVER MIND BE CONTENT I WILL DO MY BEST ON GUARD BUT SAID HE WHOM D'ARTAGNAN THUS PROVOKED IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THIS PLACE IS BADLY CHOSEN AND THAT WE SHOULD BE BETTER
211-122425-0043 BERNAJOUX WAS NOT A MAN TO HAVE SUCH A COMPLIMENT PAID TO HIM TWICE IN AN INSTANT HIS SWORD GLITTERED IN HIS HAND AND HE SPRANG UPON HIS ADVERSARY WHOM
211-122425-0044 HE HOPED TO INTIMIDATE BUT D'ARTAGNAN HAD ON THE PRECEDING DAY SERVED HIS APPRENTICESHIP FRESH SHARPENED BY HIS VICTORY FULL OF HOPES OF FUTURE FAVOR HE WAS RESOLVED NOT TO RECOIL A STEP SO THE TWO SWORDS WERE CROSSED CLOSE TO THE HILTS
211-122425-0045 AND AS D'ARTAGNAN STOOD FIRM IT WAS HIS ADVERSARY WHO MADE THE RETREATING STEP BUT D'ARTAGNAN SEIZED THE MOMENT AT WHICH IN THIS MOVEMENT THE SWORD OF BERNAJOUX DEVIATED FROM THE LINE HE FREED HIS WEAPON MADE A LUNGE AND TOUCHED HIS ADVERSARY ON THE SHOULDER
211-122425-0046 IN WHOSE SERVICE HE HAD A RELATIVE
211-122425-0047 AND PRESSING HIM WARMLY WITHOUT DOUBT WOULD SOON HAVE COMPLETED HIS WORK WITH A THIRD BLOW WHEN THE NOISE WHICH AROSE FROM THE STREET BEING HEARD IN THE TENNIS COURT TWO OF THE FRIENDS OF THE GUARDSMAN WHO HAD SEEN HIM GO OUT AFTER EXCHANGING SOME WORDS WITH D'ARTAGNAN RUSHED SWORD IN HAND FROM THE COURT AND FELL UPON THE CONQUEROR
211-122425-0048 AND THE MOMENT THE TWO GUARDSMEN ATTACKED THEIR YOUNG COMPANION DROVE THEM BACK BERNAJOUX NOW FELL AND AS THE GUARDSMEN WERE ONLY TWO AGAINST FOUR THEY BEGAN TO CRY TO THE RESCUE
211-122425-0049 AT THESE CRIES ALL WHO WERE IN THE HOTEL RUSHED OUT AND FELL UPON THE FOUR COMPANIONS WHO ON THEIR SIDE CRIED ALOUD TO THE RESCUE MUSKETEERS THIS CRY WAS GENERALLY HEEDED
211-122425-0050 TO HIS EMINENCE THUS THE SOLDIERS OF OTHER COMPANIES THAN THOSE WHICH BELONGED TO THE RED DUKE AS ARAMIS HAD CALLED HIM OFTEN TOOK PART WITH THE KING'S MUSKETEERS IN THESE QUARRELS
211-122425-0051 TO THE RESCUE MUSKETEERS TO THE RESCUE
211-122425-0052 WHO HASTENED TO THE SUCCOR OF THEIR COMRADES THE MELEE BECAME GENERAL BUT STRENGTH WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE MUSKETEERS
211-122425-0053 THE DOORS OF WHICH THEY CLOSED JUST IN TIME TO PREVENT THEIR ENEMIES FROM ENTERING WITH THEM AS TO THE WOUNDED MAN HE HAD BEEN TAKEN IN AT ONCE AND AS WE HAVE SAID IN A VERY BAD STATE
211-122425-0054 EXCITEMENT WAS AT ITS HEIGHT AMONG THE MUSKETEERS AND THEIR ALLIES AND THEY EVEN BEGAN TO DELIBERATE WHETHER THEY SHOULD NOT SET FIRE TO THE HOTEL
211-122425-0055 DOMESTICS IN DARING TO MAKE A SORTIE UPON THE KING'S MUSKETEERS THE PROPOSITION HAD BEEN MADE AND RECEIVED WITH ENTHUSIASM WHEN FORTUNATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK STRUCK
211-122425-0056 THEY SUCCEEDED IN CALMING THEIR FRIENDS WHO CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH HURLING SOME PAVING STONES AGAINST THE GATES BUT THE GATES WERE TOO STRONG THEY SOON TIRED OF THE SPORT BESIDES THOSE WHO MUST BE CONSIDERED THE LEADERS OF THE ENTERPRISE HAD QUIT THE GROUP AND WERE MAKING THEIR WAY
211-122425-0057 WHO WAS WAITING FOR THEM ALREADY INFORMED OF THIS FRESH DISTURBANCE
211-122425-0058 AND LET US ENDEAVOR TO SEE THE KING BEFORE HE IS PREJUDICED BY THE CARDINAL
211-122425-0059 AND THE TWO WILL PASS OFF TOGETHER
211-122425-0060 DIRECTED HIS COURSE TOWARD THE LOUVRE BUT TO THE GREAT ASTONISHMENT OF THE CAPTAIN OF THE MUSKETEERS HE WAS INFORMED THAT THE KING HAD GONE STAG HUNTING IN THE FOREST OF SAINT GERMAIN
211-122425-0061 REQUIRED THIS INTELLIGENCE TO BE REPEATED TO HIM TWICE AND EACH TIME HIS COMPANIONS SAW HIS BROW BECOME DARKER HAD HIS MAJESTY ASKED HE ANY INTENTION OF HOLDING THIS HUNTING PARTY YESTERDAY NO YOUR EXCELLENCY
211-122425-0062 THE MASTER OF THE HOUNDS CAME THIS MORNING TO INFORM HIM THAT HE HAD MARKED DOWN A STAG AT FIRST THE KING ANSWERED THAT HE WOULD NOT GO BUT HE COULD NOT RESIST HIS LOVE OF SPORT AND SET OUT AFTER DINNER AND THE KING HAS SEEN THE CARDINAL
211-122425-0063 GENTLEMEN I WILL SEE THE KING THIS EVENING BUT AS TO YOU I DO NOT ADVISE YOU TO RISK DOING SO THIS ADVICE WAS TOO REASONABLE AND MOREOVER CAME FROM A MAN WHO KNEW THE KING TOO WELL TO ALLOW THE FOUR YOUNG MEN TO DISPUTE IT
211-122425-0064 EVERYONE TO RETURN HOME AND WAIT FOR NEWS
211-122425-0065 WITH A LETTER IN WHICH HE BEGGED OF HIM TO EJECT THE CARDINAL'S GUARDSMEN FROM HIS HOUSE AND TO REPRIMAND HIS PEOPLE FOR THEIR AUDACITY IN MAKING SORTIE AGAINST THE KING'S MUSKETEERS
211-122425-0066 WHOSE RELATIVE AS WE ALREADY KNOW BERNAJOUX WAS
211-122425-0067 BUT ON THE CONTRARY FOR HIM WHOSE PEOPLE THE MUSKETEERS HAD ASSAULTED AND WHOSE HOTEL THEY HAD ENDEAVORED TO BURN NOW AS THE DEBATE BETWEEN THESE TWO NOBLES MIGHT LAST A LONG TIME EACH BECOMING NATURALLY MORE FIRM IN HIS OWN OPINION
211-122425-0068 HE REPAIRED THEREFORE IMMEDIATELY TO HIS HOTEL AND CAUSED HIMSELF TO BE ANNOUNCED THE TWO NOBLES SALUTED EACH OTHER POLITELY FOR IF NO FRIENDSHIP EXISTED BETWEEN THEM THERE WAS AT LEAST ESTEEM BOTH WERE MEN OF COURAGE AND HONOR
211-122425-0069 WE FANCY THAT WE HAVE EACH CAUSE TO COMPLAIN OF THE OTHER AND I AM COME TO ENDEAVOR TO CLEAR UP THIS AFFAIR
211-122425-0070 AND ALL THE FAULT IS WITH YOUR MUSKETEERS
211-122425-0071 NOT TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL I AM ABOUT TO MAKE TO YOU
211-122425-0072 IN ADDITION TO THE SWORD THRUST IN HIS ARM WHICH IS NOT DANGEROUS
211-122425-0073 OF WHICH THE DOCTOR SAYS BAD THINGS
211-122425-0074 PERFECTLY DOES HE TALK WITH DIFFICULTY BUT HE CAN SPEAK
211-122425-0075 LET US ADJURE HIM IN THE NAME OF THE GOD BEFORE WHOM HE MUST PERHAPS APPEAR TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
211-122425-0076 THEN AS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SUGGEST A MORE REASONABLE PROPOSAL HE AGREED TO IT BOTH DESCENDED TO THE CHAMBER IN WHICH THE WOUNDED MAN LAY THE LATTER ON SEEING THESE TWO NOBLE LORDS WHO CAME TO VISIT HIM ENDEAVORED TO RAISE HIMSELF UP IN HIS BED
211-122425-0077 PLACED BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH AS BERNAJOUX WAS HE HAD NO IDEA FOR A MOMENT OF CONCEALING THE TRUTH AND HE DESCRIBED TO THE TWO NOBLES THE AFFAIR EXACTLY AS IT HAD PASSED
211-122425-0078 RETURNED TO HIS HOTEL AND IMMEDIATELY SENT WORD TO THE FOUR FRIENDS THAT HE AWAITED THEIR COMPANY AT DINNER
211-122425-0079 THAT HIS EMINENCE'S GUARDSMEN HAD RECEIVED
211-122425-0080 NOT ONLY AS GOOD COMRADES BUT AS MEN WHO HAD SO OFTEN HAD THEIR TURN THAT THEY COULD VERY WELL AFFORD HIM HIS
211-122425-0081 HIS EYES THEREFORE WERE FIXED IN A SORT OF AGONY UPON THE DOOR THROUGH WHICH THE KING MUST ENTER
211-122442-0000 HE FOUND THE DOOR OF HIS PASSAGE OPEN SPRANG UP THE STAIRS AND KNOCKED SOFTLY IN A MANNER AGREED UPON BETWEEN HIM AND HIS LACKEY
211-122442-0001 WHOM HE HAD SENT HOME TWO HOURS BEFORE FROM THE HOTEL DE VILLE TELLING HIM TO SIT UP FOR HIM OPENED THE DOOR FOR HIM THE READER MAY ASK
211-122442-0002 WHEN HE WAS LEFT STIFF AS A RUSH IN LONDON IN THE INTERVENING TIME BUCKINGHAM PERHAPS SENT HIM TO PARIS AS HE DID THE HORSES HAS ANYONE BROUGHT A LETTER FOR ME ASKED D'ARTAGNAN EAGERLY
211-122442-0003 BUT ONE HAS COME OF ITSELF WHAT DO YOU MEAN BLOCKHEAD I MEAN TO SAY THAT WHEN I CAME IN ALTHOUGH I HAD THE KEY OF YOUR APARTMENT IN MY POCKET
211-122442-0004 I FOUND A LETTER ON THE GREEN TABLE COVER IN YOUR BEDROOM AND WHERE IS THAT LETTER
211-122442-0005 IT IS NOT NATURAL FOR LETTERS TO ENTER PEOPLE'S HOUSES IN THIS MANNER IF THE WINDOW HAD BEEN OPEN OR EVEN AJAR I SHOULD THINK NOTHING OF IT BUT NO ALL WAS HERMETICALLY SEALED
211-122442-0006 THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME MAGIC UNDERNEATH MEANWHILE THE YOUNG MAN HAD DARTED IN TO HIS CHAMBER AND OPENED THE LETTER
211-122442-0007 THERE ARE MANY THANKS TO BE OFFERED TO YOU AND TO BE TRANSMITTED TO YOU BE THIS EVENING ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AT SAINT CLOUD
211-122442-0008 WHILE READING THIS LETTER D'ARTAGNAN FELT HIS HEART DILATED AND COMPRESSED BY THAT DELICIOUS SPASM WHICH TORTURES AND CARESSES THE HEARTS OF LOVERS IT WAS THE FIRST BILLET HE HAD RECEIVED IT WAS THE FIRST RENDEZVOUS THAT HAD BEEN GRANTED HIM
211-122442-0009 HIS HEART SWELLED BY THE INTOXICATION OF JOY FELT READY TO DISSOLVE AWAY AT THE VERY GATE OF THAT TERRESTRIAL PARADISE CALLED LOVE
211-122442-0010 DID I NOT GUESS TRULY IS IT NOT SOME BAD AFFAIR
211-122442-0011 EXACTLY BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT LETTERS WHICH COME IN THIS WAY INTO SHUT UP HOUSES FALL FROM HEAVEN MY FRIEND FALL FROM HEAVEN
211-122442-0012 MY DEAR PLANCHET I AM THE HAPPIEST OF MEN
211-122442-0013 WHICH THE LIBERALITY OF D'ARTAGNAN HAD NOT ENTIRELY EFFACED LEFT ALONE D'ARTAGNAN READ AND REREAD HIS BILLET THEN HE KISSED AND REKISSED TWENTY TIMES THE LINES TRACED BY THE HAND OF HIS BEAUTIFUL MISTRESS
211-122442-0014 AT LENGTH HE WENT TO BED FELL ASLEEP AND HAD GOLDEN DREAMS
211-122442-0015 I AM GOING OUT FOR ALL DAY PERHAPS YOU ARE THEREFORE YOUR OWN MASTER TILL SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING BUT AT SEVEN O'CLOCK YOU MUST HOLD YOURSELF IN READINESS WITH TWO HORSES

211-122442-0021 D'ARTAGNAN'S INTENTION WAS TO GO OUT WITHOUT SPEAKING TO THE WORTHY MERCER BUT THE LATTER MADE SO POLITE AND FRIENDLY A SALUTATION THAT HIS TENANT FELT OBLIGED NOT ONLY TO STOP BUT TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION WITH HIM
211-122442-0022 BESIDES HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO AVOID A LITTLE CONDESCENSION TOWARD A HUSBAND WHOSE PRETTY WIFE HAS APPOINTED A MEETING WITH YOU THAT SAME EVENING AT SAINT CLOUD
211-122442-0023 THE CONVERSATION NATURALLY FELL UPON THE INCARCERATION OF THE POOR MAN
211-122442-0024 WHOM HE NEVER CEASED TO DESIGNATE DURING HIS ACCOUNT BY THE TITLE OF THE CARDINAL'S EXECUTIONER AND EXPATIATED AT GREAT LENGTH UPON THE BASTILLE THE BOLTS THE WICKETS THE DUNGEONS THE GRATINGS THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
211-122442-0025 D'ARTAGNAN LISTENED TO HIM WITH EXEMPLARY COMPLAISANCE AND WHEN HE HAD FINISHED SAID AND MADAME BONACIEUX DO YOU KNOW WHO CARRIED HER OFF FOR I DO NOT FORGET THAT I OWE TO THAT UNPLEASANT CIRCUMSTANCE THE GOOD FORTUNE OF HAVING MADE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE

211-122442-0077 WAS BUSY GROOMING THEM AND HAD ALREADY FINISHED TWO
211-122442-0078 HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU WHY SO PLANCHET ASKED THE YOUNG MAN
211-122442-0079 BUT WHY THIS QUESTION BECAUSE WHILE YOU WERE TALKING WITH HIM I WATCHED YOU WITHOUT LISTENING TO YOU
211-122442-0080 TWO OR THREE TIMES BAH PREOCCUPIED AS MONSIEUR WAS WITH THE LETTER HE HAD RECEIVED HE DID NOT OBSERVE THAT BUT I WHOM THE STRANGE FASHION IN WHICH THAT LETTER CAME INTO THE HOUSE HAD PLACED ON MY GUARD I DID NOT LOSE A MOVEMENT OF HIS FEATURES
211-122442-0081 AND YOU FOUND IT TRAITOROUS MONSIEUR INDEED
211-122442-0082 SHUT HIS DOOR AND SET OFF AT A QUICK PACE IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION
211-122442-0083 HEAVED A PROFOUND SIGH AND SET TO WORK TO GROOM THE THIRD HORSE
2136-5140-0000 AS ALREADY DETAILED THAT I WAS ONE NIGHT SITTING AT THE GREAT DRAWING ROOM WINDOW LOST IN THE MELANCHOLY REVERIES OF NIGHT AND IN ADMIRATION OF THE MOONLIGHTED SCENE I WAS THE ONLY OCCUPANT OF THE ROOM
2136-5140-0001 HARDLY REACHED TO THE WINDOW AT WHICH I SAT THE SHORN GRASS SLOPED GENTLY DOWNWARD FROM THE WINDOWS TILL IT MET THE BROAD LEVEL ON WHICH STOOD IN CLUMPS OR SOLITARILY SCATTERED SOME OF THE NOBLEST TIMBER IN ENGLAND
2136-5140-0002 HOAR IN THE MOONBEAMS STOOD THOSE GRACEFUL TREES CASTING THEIR MOVELESS SHADOWS UPON THE GRASS AND IN THE BACKGROUND CROWNING THE UNDULATIONS OF THE DISTANCE IN MASSES WERE PILED THOSE WOODS AMONG WHICH LAY THE SOLITARY TOMB
2136-5140-0003 TO ME FUNEREAL BUT GLORIOUS WOODS WHICH FORMED THE BACKGROUND OF THE PICTURE MY THOUGHTS RECURRED TO MY FATHER'S MYSTERIOUS INTIMATIONS AND THE IMAGE OF THE APPROACHING VISITOR AND THE THOUGHT OF THE UNKNOWN JOURNEY SADDENED ME
2136-5140-0004 IN ALL THAT CONCERNED HIS RELIGION FROM VERY EARLY ASSOCIATION THERE WAS TO ME SOMETHING OF THE UNEARTHLY AND SPECTRAL WHEN MY DEAR MAMMA DIED I WAS NOT NINE YEARS OLD AND I REMEMBER TWO DAYS BEFORE THE FUNERAL
2136-5140-0005 THERE CAME TO KNOWL WHERE SHE DIED A THIN LITTLE MAN WITH LARGE BLACK EYES AND A VERY GRAVE DARK FACE HE WAS SHUT UP A GOOD DEAL WITH MY DEAR FATHER WHO WAS IN DEEP AFFLICTION AND MISSUS RUSK USED TO SAY
2136-5140-0006 AND GOOD MISTER CLAY READY AT CALL IN THE VILLAGE MUCH GOOD THAT LITTLE BLACK WHIPPER SNAPPER WILL DO HIM WITH THAT LITTLE BLACK MAN ON THE DAY AFTER THE FUNERAL I WAS SENT OUT FOR SOME REASON FOR A WALK MY GOVERNESS WAS ILL I KNOW
2136-5140-0007 AND THERE WAS CONFUSION IN THE HOUSE AND I DARE SAY THE MAIDS MADE AS MUCH OF A HOLIDAY AS THEY COULD I REMEMBER FEELING A SORT OF AWE OF THIS LITTLE DARK MAN BUT I WAS NOT AFRAID OF HIM FOR HE WAS GENTLE THOUGH SAD AND SEEMED KIND
2136-5140-0008 HE LED ME INTO THE GARDEN THE DUTCH GARDEN WE USED TO CALL IT WITH A BALUSTRADE AND STATUES AT THE FARTHER FRONT LAID OUT IN A CARPET PATTERN OF BRILLIANTLY COLOURED FLOWERS WE CAME DOWN THE BROAD FLIGHT OF CAEN STONE STEPS INTO THIS
2136-5140-0009 AND WE WALKED IN SILENCE TO THE BALUSTRADE THE BASE WAS TOO HIGH AT THE SPOT WHERE WE REACHED IT FOR ME TO SEE OVER BUT HOLDING MY HAND HE SAID
2136-5140-0010 WELL YOU CAN'T BUT I CAN SEE BEYOND IT SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT I SEE EVER SO MUCH I SEE A COTTAGE WITH A STEEP ROOF THAT LOOKS LIKE GOLD IN THE SUNLIGHT
2136-5140-0011 GROWING BY THE WALLS AND WINDOWS AND TWO LITTLE CHILDREN ARE PLAYING AMONG THE STEMS OF THE TREES AND WE ARE ON OUR WAY THERE AND IN A FEW MINUTES SHALL BE UNDER THOSE TREES OURSELVES AND TALKING TO THOSE LITTLE CHILDREN
2136-5140-0012 YET NOW TO ME IT IS BUT A PICTURE IN MY BRAIN AND TO YOU BUT A STORY TOLD BY ME WHICH YOU BELIEVE COME DEAR LET US BE GOING SO WE DESCENDED THE STEPS AT THE RIGHT
2136-5140-0013 AND THERE WE STOOD IN RICH SUNLIGHT AMONG THE MANY OBJECTS HE HAD DESCRIBED IS THIS YOUR HOUSE MY LITTLE MEN HE ASKED OF THE CHILDREN PRETTY LITTLE ROSY BOYS WHO ASSENTED AND HE LEANED WITH HIS OPEN HAND AGAINST THE STEM OF ONE OF THE TREES
2136-5140-0014 THE SAME ON WHICH I WAS NOW LOOKING IN THE DISTANCE EVERY NOW AND THEN HE MADE ME SIT DOWN TO REST
2136-5140-0015 WOULD RELATE SOME LITTLE STORY REFLECTING EVEN TO MY CHILDISH MIND A STRANGE SUSPICION OF A SPIRITUAL MEANING
2136-5140-0016 AND SOMEHOW STARTLING IN ITS VERY VAGUENESS THUS ENTERTAINED THOUGH A LITTLE AWFULLY I ACCOMPANIED THE DARK MYSTERIOUS LITTLE WHIPPER SNAPPER THROUGH THE WOODLAND GLADES
2136-5140-0017 WE CAME TO ME QUITE UNEXPECTEDLY IN THE DEEP SYLVAN SHADOWS UPON THE GREY PILLARED TEMPLE FOUR FRONTED WITH A SLANTING PEDESTAL OF LICHEN STAINED STEPS
2136-5140-0018 THE LONELY SEPULCHRE IN WHICH I HAD THE MORNING BEFORE SEEN POOR MAMMA LAID AT THE SIGHT THE FOUNTAINS OF MY GRIEF REOPENED AND I CRIED BITTERLY REPEATING OH MAMMA MAMMA LITTLE MAMMA
2136-5140-0019 AND SO WENT ON WEEPING AND CALLING WILDLY ON THE DEAF AND THE SILENT THERE WAS A STONE BENCH SOME TEN STEPS AWAY FROM THE TOMB SIT DOWN BESIDE ME MY CHILD SAID THE GRAVE MAN WITH THE BLACK EYES VERY KINDLY AND GENTLY
2136-5140-0020 NOW WHAT DO YOU SEE THERE HE ASKED POINTING HORIZONTALLY WITH HIS STICK TOWARDS THE CENTRE OF THE OPPOSITE STRUCTURE OH THAT THAT PLACE WHERE POOR MAMMA IS
2136-5140-0021 YES A STONE WALL WITH PILLARS TOO HIGH FOR EITHER YOU OR ME TO SEE OVER BUT HERE HE MENTIONED A NAME WHICH I THINK MUST HAVE BEEN SWEDENBORG
2136-5140-0022 I ONLY KNOW THAT IT SOUNDED TO ME LIKE THE NAME OF A MAGICIAN IN A FAIRY TALE I FANCIED HE LIVED IN THE WOOD WHICH SURROUNDED US AND I BEGAN TO GROW FRIGHTENED AS HE PROCEEDED BUT SWEDENBORG SEES BEYOND IT OVER AND THROUGH IT
2136-5140-0023 AND HAS TOLD ME ALL THAT CONCERNS US TO KNOW HE SAYS YOUR MAMMA IS NOT THERE SHE IS TAKEN AWAY I CRIED STARTING UP AND WITH STREAMING EYES GAZING ON THE BUILDING WHICH THOUGH I STAMPED MY FEET IN MY DISTRACTION
2136-5140-0024 I WAS AFRAID TO APPROACH OH IS MAMMA TAKEN AWAY WHERE IS SHE WHERE HAVE THEY BROUGHT HER TO I WAS UTTERING UNCONSCIOUSLY VERY NEARLY THE QUESTION WITH WHICH MARY
2136-5140-0025 IN THE GREY OF THAT WONDROUS MORNING ON WHICH SHE STOOD BY THE EMPTY SEPULCHRE ACCOSTED THE FIGURE STANDING NEAR YOUR MAMMA IS ALIVE BUT TOO FAR AWAY TO SEE OR HEAR US SWEDENBORG STANDING HERE CAN SEE AND HEAR HER
2136-5140-0026 AND TELLS ME ALL HE SEES JUST AS I TOLD YOU IN THE GARDEN ABOUT THE LITTLE BOYS AND THE COTTAGE AND THE TREES AND FLOWERS WHICH YOU COULD NOT SEE
2136-5140-0027 SO I CAN TELL YOU NOW AS I DID THEN AND AS WE ARE BOTH I HOPE WALKING ON TO THE SAME PLACE JUST AS WE DID TO THE TREES AND COTTAGE
2136-5140-0028 HOW TRUE THE DESCRIPTION IS WHICH I GIVE YOU I WAS VERY FRIGHTENED FOR I FEARED THAT WHEN HE HAD DONE HIS NARRATIVE
2136-5140-0029 AND OF SHADOWS WHERE THE DEAD WERE VISIBLE HE LEANED HIS ELBOW ON HIS KNEE AND HIS FOREHEAD ON HIS HAND WHICH SHADED HIS DOWNCAST EYES IN THAT ATTITUDE HE DESCRIBED TO ME A BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE
2136-5140-0030 RADIANT WITH A WONDROUS LIGHT IN WHICH REJOICING MY MOTHER MOVED ALONG AN AIRY PATH ASCENDING AMONG MOUNTAINS OF FANTASTIC HEIGHT AND PEAKS MELTING IN CELESTIAL COLOURING INTO THE AIR
2136-5140-0031 HE SAID THE SAME WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN BEFORE COME DEAR LET US GO OH NO NO NO NOT NOW I SAID RESISTING AND VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED HOME I MEAN DEAR
2136-5140-0032 WE CANNOT WALK TO THE PLACE I HAVE DESCRIBED WE CAN ONLY REACH IT THROUGH THE GATE OF DEATH TO WHICH WE ARE ALL TENDING YOUNG AND OLD WITH SURE STEPS AND WHERE IS THE GATE OF DEATH I ASKED IN A SORT OF WHISPER AS WE WALKED TOGETHER
2136-5140-0033 HOLDING HIS HAND AND LOOKING STEALTHILY HE SMILED SADLY AND SAID WHEN SOONER OR LATER THE TIME COMES AS HAGAR'S EYES WERE OPENED IN THE WILDERNESS AND SHE BEHELD THE FOUNTAIN OF WATER
2136-5140-0034 SO SHALL EACH OF US SEE THE DOOR OPEN BEFORE US AND ENTER IN AND BE REFRESHED FOR A LONG TIME FOLLOWING THIS WALK I WAS VERY NERVOUS MORE SO FOR THE AWFUL MANNER IN WHICH MISSUS RUSK RECEIVED MY STATEMENT
2136-5140-0035 WITH STERN LIPS AND UPTURNED HANDS AND EYES AND AN ANGRY EXPOSTULATION I DO WONDER AT YOU MARY QUINCE LETTING THE CHILD WALK INTO THE WOOD WITH THAT LIMB OF DARKNESS IT IS A MERCY HE DID NOT SHOW HER THE DEVIL
2136-5140-0036 OR FRIGHTEN HER OUT OF HER SENSES IN THAT LONELY PLACE OF THESE SWEDENBORGIANS INDEED I KNOW NO MORE THAN I MIGHT LEARN FROM GOOD MISSUS RUSK'S VERY INACCURATE TALK TWO OR THREE OF THEM CROSSED IN THE COURSE OF MY EARLY LIFE
2136-5140-0037 BUT I GREW AFTER A DAY OR TWO SO NERVOUS THAT I LAID IT ASIDE IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME TO KNOW THAT THEIR FOUNDER EITHER SAW OR FANCIED HE SAW AMAZING VISIONS WHICH SO FAR FROM SUPERSEDING CONFIRMED
2136-5140-0038 AND INTERPRETED THE LANGUAGE OF THE BIBLE AND AS DEAR PAPA ACCEPTED THEIR IDEAS I AM HAPPY IN THINKING THAT THEY DID NOT CONFLICT WITH THE SUPREME AUTHORITY OF HOLY WRIT LEANING ON MY HAND I WAS NOW LOOKING UPON THAT SOLEMN WOOD
2136-5140-0039 WHITE AND SHADOWY IN THE MOONLIGHT WHERE FOR A LONG TIME AFTER THAT RAMBLE WITH THE VISIONARY I FANCIED THE GATE OF DEATH HIDDEN ONLY BY A STRANGE GLAMOUR AND THE DAZZLING LAND OF GHOSTS WERE SITUATE
2136-5140-0040 AND I SUPPOSE THESE EARLIER ASSOCIATIONS GAVE TO MY REVERIE ABOUT MY FATHER'S COMING VISITOR
2136-5143-0000 CHAPTER SIX A WALK IN THE WOOD TWO LITTLE PIECES OF BY PLAY IN WHICH I DETECTED HER CONFIRMED MY UNPLEASANT SUSPICION FROM THE CORNER OF THE GALLERY I ONE DAY SAW HER WHEN SHE THOUGHT I WAS OUT AND ALL QUIET
2136-5143-0001 WITH HER EAR AT THE KEYHOLE OF PAPA'S STUDY
2136-5143-0002 HER EYES WERE TURNED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE STAIRS FROM WHICH ONLY SHE APPREHENDED SURPRISE HER GREAT MOUTH WAS OPEN AND HER EYES ABSOLUTELY GOGGLED WITH EAGERNESS SHE WAS DEVOURING ALL THAT WAS PASSING THERE
2136-5143-0003 INDIGNATION HOWEVER QUICKLY RETURNED AND I CAME BACK TREADING BRISKLY AS I DID SO WHEN I REACHED THE ANGLE OF THE GALLERY AGAIN MADAME I SUPPOSE HAD HEARD ME FOR SHE WAS HALF WAY DOWN THE STAIRS
2136-5143-0004 I AM SO GLAD TO FIND YOU AND YOU ARE DRESS TO COME OUT WE SHALL HAVE SO PLEASANT WALK AT THAT MOMENT THE DOOR OF MY FATHER'S STUDY OPENED AND MISSUS RUSK WITH HER DARK ENERGETIC FACE VERY MUCH FLUSHED STEPPED OUT IN HIGH EXCITEMENT
2136-5143-0005 THE MASTER SAYS YOU MAY HAVE THE BRANDY BOTTLE MADAME AND I'M GLAD TO BE RID OF IT I AM MADAME COURTESIED WITH A GREAT SMIRK THAT WAS FULL OF INTANGIBLE HATE AND INSULT BETTER YOUR OWN BRANDY IF DRINK YOU MUST EXCLAIMED MISSUS RUSK
2136-5143-0006 YOU MAY COME TO THE STORE ROOM NOW OR THE BUTLER CAN TAKE IT AND OFF WHISKED MISSUS RUSK FOR THE BACK STAIRCASE THERE HAD BEEN NO COMMON SKIRMISH ON THIS OCCASION BUT A PITCHED BATTLE MADAME HAD MADE A SORT OF PET OF ANNE WIXTED AN UNDERCHAMBERMAID
2136-5143-0007 WITH A BRANDY BOTTLE UNDER HER APRON STEALING UP STAIRS
2136-5143-0008 MADAME HAD COMMISSIONED HER TO BUY IT IN THE TOWN AND CONVEY IT TO HER BED ROOM UPON THIS MISSUS RUSK IMPOUNDED THE FLASK AND WITH ANNE BESIDE HER RATHER PRECIPITATELY APPEARED BEFORE THE MASTER HE HEARD AND SUMMONED MADAME
2136-5143-0009 MADAME WAS COOL FRANK AND FLUENT THE BRANDY WAS PURELY MEDICINAL SHE PRODUCED A DOCUMENT IN THE FORM OF A NOTE DOCTOR SOMEBODY PRESENTED HIS COMPLIMENTS TO MADAME DE LA ROUGIERRE AND ORDERED HER A TABLE SPOONFUL OF BRANDY
2136-5143-0010 AND SOME DROPS OF LAUDANUM WHENEVER THE PAIN OF STOMACH RETURNED
2136-5143-0011 SHE CLAIMED HER MEDICINE MAN'S ESTIMATE OF WOMAN IS HIGHER THAN WOMAN'S OWN PERHAPS IN THEIR RELATIONS TO MEN THEY ARE GENERALLY MORE TRUSTWORTHY PERHAPS WOMAN'S IS THE JUSTER AND THE OTHER AN APPOINTED ILLUSION

2136-5147-0006 NOT SORRY SOMEHOW TO ESCAPE BEFORE CAPTAIN OAKLEY RETURNED AS I WENT ALONG THE PASSAGE I WAS THINKING WHETHER MY DRESS COULD BE SO VERY RIDICULOUS AS MY OLD COUSIN THOUGHT IT AND TRYING IN VAIN
2136-5147-0007 TO RECOLLECT ANY EVIDENCE OF A SIMILAR CONTEMPTUOUS ESTIMATE ON THE PART OF THAT BEAUTIFUL AND GARRULOUS DANDY I COULD NOT QUITE THE REVERSE INDEED STILL I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AND FEVERISH
2136-5147-0008 GIRLS OF MY THEN AGE WILL EASILY CONCEIVE HOW MISERABLE UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH A MISGIVING WOULD MAKE THEM IT WAS A LONG WAY TO MADAME'S ROOM I MET MISSUS RUSK BUSTLING ALONG THE PASSAGE WITH A HOUSEMAID
2136-5147-0009 HOW IS MADAME I ASKED QUITE WELL I BELIEVE ANSWERED THE HOUSEKEEPER DRILY NOTHING THE MATTER THAT I KNOW OF SHE EAT ENOUGH FOR TWO TO DAY
2136-5147-0010 I TRY TO SWALLOW A LITTLE TO PLEASE HER AND YOUR COLD IS IT BETTER SHE SHOOK HER HEAD LANGUIDLY HER ELBOW RESTING ON THE CHAIR AND THREE FINGER TIPS SUPPORTING HER FOREHEAD AND THEN SHE MADE A LITTLE SIGH
2136-5147-0011 LOOKING DOWN FROM THE CORNERS OF HER EYES IN AN INTERESTING DEJECTION
2136-5147-0012 BUT I AM QUAITE APPY
2136-5147-0013 AND WITH THESE WORDS SHE TURNED A LANGUID GLANCE OF GRATITUDE ON ME WHICH DROPPED ON THE GROUND LADY KNOLLYS WISHES VERY MUCH TO SEE YOU ONLY FOR A FEW MINUTES IF YOU COULD ADMIT HER
2136-5147-0014 VOUS SAVEZ LES MALADES SEE NEVER VISITORS SHE REPLIED WITH A STARTLED SORT OF TARTNESS AND A MOMENTARY ENERGY BESIDES I CANNOT CONVERSE
2136-5147-0015 OF HEAD AND OF THE EAR THE RIGHT EAR IT IS PARFOIS AGONY ABSOLUTELY AND NOW IT IS HERE AND SHE WINCED AND MOANED WITH HER EYES CLOSED AND HER HAND PRESSED TO THE ORGAN AFFECTED
2136-5147-0016 SIMPLE AS I WAS I FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT MADAME WAS SHAMMING SHE WAS OVER ACTING HER TRANSITIONS WERE TOO VIOLENT AND BESIDE SHE FORGOT THAT I KNEW HOW WELL SHE COULD SPEAK ENGLISH AND MUST PERCEIVE THAT SHE WAS HEIGHTENING THE INTEREST OF HER HELPLESSNESS
2136-5147-0017 BY THAT PRETTY TESSELLATION OF FOREIGN IDIOM I THERE FORE SAID WITH A KIND OF COURAGE WHICH SOMETIMES HELPED ME SUDDENLY OH MADAME DON'T YOU REALLY THINK YOU MIGHT WITHOUT MUCH INCONVENIENCE SEE LADY KNOLLYS FOR A VERY FEW MINUTES
2136-5147-0018 BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE YOU MUST SEE QUITE IMPOSSIBLE I NEVER YOU KNOW REFUSE TO TAKE TROUBLE WHEN I AM ABLE NEVER NEVER AND MADAME SHED SOME TEARS WHICH ALWAYS CAME AT CALL
2136-5147-0019 AND WITH HER HAND PRESSED TO HER EAR SAID VERY FAINTLY BE SO GOOD TO TELL YOUR FRIEND HOW YOU SEE ME AND HOW I SUFFER
2136-5147-0020 SINCE THE PAIN WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO REMAIN LONGER SO WITH A FEW WORDS OF COMFORT WHICH COULD NOT WELL BE REFUSED
2136-5147-0021 I RETURNED TO THE DRAWING ROOM
2136-5147-0022 HAS GONE TO THE BILLIARD ROOM I THINK
2136-5147-0023 THAT THEN ACCOUNTED FOR THE RUMBLE AND SMACK OF BALLS WHICH I HAD HEARD AS I PASSED THE DOOR I HAVE BEEN TELLING MAUD HOW DETESTABLY SHE IS GOT UP VERY THOUGHTFUL OF YOU MONICA SAID MY FATHER
2136-5147-0024 YES AND REALLY AUSTIN IT IS QUITE CLEAR YOU OUGHT TO MARRY YOU WANT SOME ONE TO TAKE THIS GIRL OUT AND LOOK AFTER HER AND WHO'S TO DO IT
2136-5147-0025 AND IT IS REALLY SUCH A PITY FOR SHE'S A VERY PRETTY CREATURE AND A CLEVER WOMAN COULD MAKE HER QUITE CHARMING
2136-5147-0026 EIGHT AND TWENTY YEARS AGO OR MORE WITH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS WELL YOU KNOW SHE HAS GOT EVER SO MUCH NOW
2136-5147-0027 AND THOUGH YOU WOULD NOT HAVE HER THEN SHE HAS HAD HER SECOND HUSBAND SINCE I CAN TELL YOU I'M GLAD I WAS NOT THE FIRST SAID MY FATHER WELL THEY REALLY SAY HER WEALTH IS ABSOLUTELY IMMENSE HER LAST HUSBAND
2136-5147-0028 THE RUSSIAN MERCHANT LEFT HER EVERYTHING SHE HAS NOT A HUMAN RELATION AND SHE IS IN THE BEST SET YOU WERE ALWAYS A MATCH MAKER MONICA SAID MY FATHER STOPPING AND PUTTING HIS HAND KINDLY ON HERS
2136-5147-0029 BUT IT WON'T DO NO NO MONICA WE MUST TAKE CARE OF LITTLE MAUD SOME OTHER WAY I WAS RELIEVED WE WOMEN HAVE ALL AN INSTINCTIVE DREAD OF SECOND MARRIAGES
2136-5147-0030 AND THINK THAT NO WIDOWER IS QUITE ABOVE OR BELOW THAT DANGER AND I REMEMBER WHENEVER MY FATHER WHICH INDEED WAS BUT SELDOM MADE A VISIT TO TOWN OR ANYWHERE ELSE IT WAS A SAYING OF MISSUS RUSK
2136-5147-0031 I SHAN'T WONDER NEITHER NEED YOU MY DEAR IF HE BRINGS HOME A YOUNG WIFE WITH HIM SO MY FATHER WITH A KIND LOOK AT HER AND A VERY TENDER ONE ON ME WENT SILENTLY TO THE LIBRARY AS HE OFTEN DID ABOUT THAT HOUR
2136-5147-0032 I SUPPOSE THEY DID NOT WISH A REVOLUTION AND ALL ITS CONSEQUENCES AT KNOWL AND THOUGHT IT NO HARM TO EXCITE MY VIGILANCE BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE LONG TO BE VEXED WITH COUSIN MONICA
2136-5147-0033 YOU KNOW MY DEAR YOUR FATHER IS AN ODDITY SHE SAID I DON'T MIND HIM I NEVER DID YOU MUST NOT CRACKY MY DEAR CRACKY DECIDEDLY CRACKY AND SHE TAPPED THE CORNER OF HER FOREHEAD WITH A LOOK SO SLY AND COMICAL
2136-5147-0034 THAT I THINK I SHOULD HAVE LAUGHED IF THE SENTIMENT HAD NOT BEEN SO AWFULLY IRREVERENT WELL DEAR HOW IS OUR FRIEND THE MILLINER MADAME IS SUFFERING SO MUCH FROM PAIN IN HER EAR THAT SHE SAYS IT WOULD BE QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE THE HONOUR HONOUR FIDDLE
2136-5147-0035 PAIN IN HER EAR YOU SAY POOR THING WELL DEAR I THINK I CAN CURE THAT IN FIVE MINUTES I HAVE IT MYSELF NOW AND THEN COME TO MY ROOM AND WE'LL GET THE BOTTLES SO SHE LIGHTED HER CANDLE IN THE LOBBY AND WITH A LIGHT AND AGILE STEP
2136-5147-0036 SHE SCALED THE STAIRS I FOLLOWING AND HAVING FOUND THE REMEDIES WE APPROACHED MADAME'S ROOM TOGETHER I THINK WHILE WE WERE STILL AT THE END OF THE GALLERY MADAME HEARD AND DIVINED OUR APPROACH FOR HER DOOR SUDDENLY SHUT
2136-5147-0037 AND THERE WAS A FUMBLING AT THE HANDLE BUT THE BOLT WAS OUT OF ORDER
2136-5147-0038 THERE WAS NO ANSWER SO SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND WE BOTH ENTERED MADAME HAD ROLLED HERSELF IN THE BLUE COVERLET AND WAS LYING ON THE BED WITH HER FACE BURIED IN THE PILLOW AND ENVELOPED IN THE COVERING PERHAPS SHE'S ASLEEP SAID LADY KNOLLYS
2136-5147-0039 GETTING ROUND TO THE SIDE OF THE BED AND STOOPING OVER HER MADAME LAY STILL AS A MOUSE COUSIN MONICA SET DOWN HER TWO LITTLE VIALS ON THE TABLE AND STOOPING AGAIN OVER THE BED BEGAN VERY GENTLY WITH HER FINGERS TO LIFT THE COVERLET THAT COVERED HER FACE
2136-5147-0040 MADAME UTTERED A SLUMBERING MOAN AND TURNED MORE UPON HER FACE CLASPING THE COVERLET FASTER ABOUT HER MADAME IT IS MAUD AND LADY KNOLLYS WE HAVE COME TO RELIEVE YOUR EAR PRAY LET ME SEE IT
2159-179154-0000 COURTING A BROOMSTICK THE SIDE SHOW LET US NOW DESCRIBE SOME OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF HYPNOTISM TO SEE JUST HOW IT OPERATES AND HOW IT EXHIBITS ITSELF
2159-179154-0001 THE FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF A PUBLIC PERFORMANCE GIVEN BY DOCTOR HERBERT L FLINT A VERY SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC OPERATOR IT IS IN THE LANGUAGE OF AN EYE WITNESS A NEW YORK LAWYER
2159-179154-0002 IN RESPONSE TO A CALL FOR VOLUNTEERS TWENTY YOUNG AND MIDDLE AGED MEN CAME UPON THE STAGE THEY EVIDENTLY BELONGED TO THE GREAT MIDDLE CLASS THE ENTERTAINMENT COMMENCED BY DOCTOR FLINT PASSING AROUND THE GROUP
2159-179154-0003 WHO WERE SEATED ON THE STAGE IN A SEMICIRCLE FACING THE AUDIENCE AND STROKING EACH ONE'S HEAD AND FOREHEAD REPEATING THE PHRASES CLOSE YOUR EYES THINK OF NOTHING BUT SLEEP YOU ARE VERY TIRED YOU ARE DROWSY
2159-179154-0004 YOU FEEL VERY SLEEPY AS HE DID THIS SEVERAL OF THE VOLUNTEERS CLOSED THEIR EYES AT ONCE AND ONE FELL ASLEEP IMMEDIATELY ONE OR TWO REMAINED AWAKE
2159-179154-0005 WHILE A FEW WERE WIDE AWAKE AND SMILING AT THE REST THESE LATTER WERE DISMISSED AS UNLIKELY SUBJECTS WHEN THE STAGE HAD BEEN CLEARED OF ALL THOSE WHO WERE NOT RESPONSIVE THE DOCTOR PASSED AROUND AND SNAPPING HIS FINGER
2159-179154-0006 AT EACH INDIVIDUAL AWOKE HIM ONE OF THE SUBJECTS WHEN QUESTIONED AFTERWARD AS TO WHAT SENSATION HE EXPERIENCED AT THE SNAPPING OF THE FINGERS REPLIED THAT IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF SOMETHING INSIDE OF HIS HEAD RESPONDED
2159-179154-0007 AND WITH THIS SENSATION HE REGAINED SELF CONSCIOUSNESS THIS IS TO BE DOUBTED AS A RULE SUBJECTS IN THIS STAGE OF HYPNOTISM DO NOT FEEL ANY SENSATION THAT THEY CAN REMEMBER
2159-179154-0008 THAT YOU CAN'T PULL THEM APART THEY ARE FAST YOU CANNOT PULL THEM APART TRY YOU CAN'T THE WHOLE CLASS MADE FRANTIC EFFORTS TO UNCLASP THEIR HANDS BUT WERE UNABLE TO DO SO THE DOCTOR'S EXPLANATION OF THIS IS
2159-179154-0009 THAT WHAT THEY WERE REALLY DOING WAS TO FORCE THEIR HANDS CLOSER TOGETHER THUS OBEYING THE COUNTER SUGGESTION THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE TRYING TO UNCLASP THEIR HANDS WAS EVIDENT FROM THEIR ENDEAVORS
2159-179154-0010 ONE YOUNG FELLOW AGED ABOUT EIGHTEEN SAID THAT HE WAS ADDICTED TO THE CIGARETTE HABIT THE SUGGESTION WAS MADE TO HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER THE ENTERTAINMENT HE WAS ASKED TO SMOKE AS WAS HIS USUAL HABIT
2159-179154-0011 HE WAS THEN AWAY FROM ANY ONE WHO COULD INFLUENCE HIM HE REPLIED THAT THE VERY IDEA WAS REPUGNANT HOWEVER HE WAS INDUCED TO TAKE A CIGARETTE IN HIS MOUTH BUT IT MADE HIM ILL AND HE FLUNG IT AWAY WITH EVERY EXPRESSION OF DISGUST
2159-179154-0012 THIS IS AN INSTANCE OF WHAT IS CALLED POST HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION DOCTOR COCKE TELLS OF SUGGESTING TO A DRINKER WHOM HE WAS TRYING TO CURE OF THE HABIT THAT FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS ANYTHING HE TOOK WOULD MAKE HIM VOMIT
2159-179154-0013 THEY IMMEDIATELY BEGAN AND TWIRLED THEM FASTER AND FASTER IN SPITE OF THEIR EFFORTS TO STOP ONE OF THE SUBJECTS SAID HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT THE STRANGE ACTION OF HIS HANDS AND SOMETIMES IT PUZZLED HIM TO KNOW WHY THEY WHIRLED
2159-179154-0014 AT THIS POINT DOCTOR FLINT'S DAUGHTER TOOK CHARGE OF THE CLASS SHE POINTED HER FINGER AT ONE OF THEM AND THE SUBJECT BEGAN TO LOOK STEADILY BEFORE HIM AT WHICH THE REST OF THE CLASS WERE HIGHLY AMUSED
2159-179154-0015 PRESENTLY THE SUBJECT'S HEAD LEANED FORWARD THE PUPILS OF HIS EYES DILATED AND ASSUMED A PECULIAR GLASSY STARE HE AROSE WITH A STEADY GLIDING GAIT
2159-179154-0016 THEN HE STOPPED MISS FLINT LED HIM TO THE FRONT OF THE STAGE AND LEFT HIM STANDING IN PROFOUND SLUMBER HE STOOD THERE STOOPING EYES SET AND VACANT FAST ASLEEP
2159-179154-0017 IN THE MEANTIME THE ACT HAD CAUSED GREAT LAUGHTER AMONG THE REST OF THE CLASS ONE YOUNG FELLOW IN PARTICULAR LAUGHED SO UPROARIOUSLY THAT TEARS COURSED DOWN HIS CHEEKS AND HE TOOK OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF TO WIPE HIS EYES
2159-179154-0018 JUST AS HE WAS RETURNING IT TO HIS POCKET THE LADY SUDDENLY POINTED A FINGER AT HIM
2159-179154-0019 BUT THE MOMENT THE GESTURE WAS MADE HIS COUNTENANCE FELL HIS MIRTH STOPPED WHILE THAT OF HIS COMPANIONS REDOUBLED AND THE CHANGE WAS SO OBVIOUS THAT THE AUDIENCE SHARED IN THE LAUGHTER BUT THE SUBJECT NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD
2159-179154-0020 HIS EYES ASSUMED THE SAME EXPRESSION THAT HAD BEEN NOTICED IN HIS COMPANION'S HE TOO AROSE IN THE SAME ATTITUDE AS IF HIS HEAD WERE PULLING THE BODY ALONG AND FOLLOWING THE FINGER IN THE SAME WAY AS HIS PREDECESSOR
2159-179154-0021 ANOTHER WAS GIVEN A BROOMSTICK AND TOLD TO HUNT GAME IN THE WOODS BEFORE HIM ANOTHER WAS GIVEN A LARGE RAG DOLL AND TOLD THAT IT WAS AN INFANT AND THAT HE MUST LOOK AMONG THE AUDIENCE AND DISCOVER THE FATHER
2159-179154-0022 HE WAS INFORMED THAT HE COULD TELL WHO THE FATHER WAS BY THE SIMILARITY AND THE COLOR OF THE EYES THESE SUGGESTIONS WERE MADE IN A LOUD TONE MISS FLINT BEING NO NEARER ONE SUBJECT THAN ANOTHER
2159-179154-0023 THE BARE SUGGESTION WAS GIVEN AS NOW THINK THAT YOU ARE A NEWSBOY AND ARE SELLING PAPERS OR NOW THINK THAT YOU ARE HUNTING AND ARE GOING INTO THE WOODS TO SHOOT BIRDS SO THE PARTY WAS STARTED
2159-179154-0024 AT THE SAME TIME INTO THE AUDIENCE THE ONE WHO WAS IMPERSONATING A NEWSBOY WENT ABOUT CRYING HIS EDITION IN A LOUD VOICE WHILE THE HUNTER CRAWLED ALONG STEALTHILY AND CAREFULLY
2159-179154-0025 THE NEWSBOY EVEN ADOPTED THE WELL WORN DEVICE OF ASKING THOSE WHOM HE SOLICITED TO BUY TO HELP HIM GET RID OF HIS STOCK ONE MAN OFFERED HIM A CENT WHEN THE PRICE WAS TWO CENTS THE NEWSBOY CHAFFED THE WOULD BE PURCHASER
2159-179154-0026 AND TAKING HIM INTO THE CENTER OF THE STAGE SHOWED HIM A SMALL RIDING WHIP HE LOOKED AT IT INDIFFERENTLY ENOUGH HE WAS TOLD IT WAS A HOT BAR OF IRON BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD STILL INCREDULOUS
2159-179154-0027 THE SUGGESTION WAS REPEATED AND AS THE GLAZED LOOK CAME INTO HIS EYES THE INCREDULOUS LOOK DIED OUT EVERY MEMBER OF THE CLASS WAS FOLLOWING THE SUGGESTION MADE TO THE SUBJECT IN HAND ALL OF THEM HAD THE SAME EXPRESSION IN THEIR EYES THE DOCTOR SAID
2159-179154-0028 THAT HIS DAUGHTER WAS HYPNOTIZING THE WHOLE CLASS THROUGH THIS ONE INDIVIDUAL AS SHE SPOKE SHE LIGHTLY TOUCHED THE SUBJECT WITH THE END OF THE WHIP THE MOMENT THE SUBJECT FELT THE WHIP HE JUMPED AND SHRIEKED AS IF IT REALLY WERE A HOT IRON
2159-179154-0029 SHE TOUCHED EACH ONE OF THE CLASS IN SUCCESSION AND EVERY ONE MANIFESTED THE UTMOST PAIN AND FEAR ONE SUBJECT SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND CRIED IN DIRE DISTRESS
2159-179154-0030 HAD THE SUGGESTION BEEN CONTINUED IT WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE RAISED A BLISTER ONE OF THE AMUSING EXPERIMENTS TRIED AT A LATER TIME WAS THAT OF A TALL YOUNG MAN DIFFIDENT PALE AND MODEST BEING GIVEN A BROOM CAREFULLY WRAPPED IN A SHEET
2159-179154-0031 AND TOLD THAT IT WAS HIS SWEETHEART HE ACCEPTED THE SITUATION AND SAT DOWN BY THE BROOM HE WAS A LITTLE SHEEPISH AT FIRST BUT EVENTUALLY HE GREW BOLDER AND SMILED UPON HER SUCH A SMILE AS MALVOLIO CASTS UPON OLIVIA
2159-179154-0032 THE MANNER IN WHICH LITTLE BY LITTLE HE VENTURED UPON A FAMILIAR FOOTING WAS EXCEEDINGLY FUNNY BUT WHEN IN A MOMENT OF CONFIDENT RESPONSE TO HIS WOOING HE CLASPED HER ROUND THE WAIST AND IMPRINTED A CHASTE KISS UPON THE BRUSHY PART OF THE BROOM
2159-179154-0033 DISGUISED BY THE SHEET THE HOUSE RESOUNDED WITH ROARS OF LAUGHTER THE SUBJECT HOWEVER WAS DEAF TO ALL OF THE NOISE HE WAS ABSORBED IN HIS COURTSHIP AND HE CONTINUED TO HUG THE BROOM AND EXHIBIT IN HIS FEATURES
2159-179154-0034 ALL THE WORLD LOVES A LOVER AS THE SAYING IS AND ALL THE WORLD LOVES TO LAUGH AT HIM ONE OF THE SUBJECTS WAS TOLD THAT THE HEAD OF A MAN IN THE AUDIENCE WAS ON FIRE
2159-179154-0035 HE LOOKED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN DASHED DOWN THE PLATFORM INTO THE AUDIENCE AND SEIZING THE MAN'S HEAD VIGOROUSLY RUBBED IT AS THIS DID NOT EXTINGUISH THE FLAMES HE TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND PUT THE FIRE OUT IN DOING THIS HE SET HIS COAT ON FIRE
2159-179154-0036 THEN HE CALMLY RESUMED HIS GARMENT AND WALKED BACK TO THE STAGE THE SIDE SHOW CLOSED THE EVENING'S ENTERTAINMENT A YOUNG MAN WAS TOLD TO THINK OF HIMSELF AS MANAGING A SIDE SHOW AT A CIRCUS
2159-179154-0037 WHEN HIS MIND HAD ABSORBED THIS IDEA HE WAS ORDERED TO OPEN HIS EXHIBITION HE AT ONCE MOUNTED A TABLE AND IN THE VOICE OF THE TRADITIONAL SIDE SHOW FAKIR BEGAN TO DILATE UPON THE FAT WOMAN AND THE SNAKES
2159-179154-0038 THAT FOR THE SMALL SUM OF TEN CENTS THEY COULD SEE MORE WONDERS THAN EVER BEFORE HAD BEEN CROWDED UNDER ONE CANVAS TENT HE HARANGUED THE CROWD AS THEY SURGED ABOUT THE TENT DOOR
2159-179154-0039 HE POINTED TO A SUPPOSITIOUS CANVAS PICTURE HE CHAFFED THE BOYS HE FLATTERED THE VANITY OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS WITH THEIR GIRLS TELLING THEM THAT THEY COULD NOT AFFORD FOR THE SMALL SUM OF TEN CENTS TO MISS THIS GREAT SHOW
2159-179156-0000 HOW THE SUBJECT FEELS UNDER HYPNOTIZATION DOCTOR COOPER'S EXPERIENCE EFFECT OF MUSIC DOCTOR ALFRED MARTHIEU'S EXPERIMENTS
2159-179156-0001 THE SENSATIONS PRODUCED DURING A STATE OF HYPNOSIS ARE VERY INTERESTING AS MAY BE SUPPOSED THEY DIFFER GREATLY IN DIFFERENT PERSONS
2159-179156-0002 ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING ACCOUNTS EVER GIVEN IS THAT OF DOCTOR JAMES R COCKE A HYPNOTIST HIMSELF WHO SUBMITTED TO BEING OPERATED UPON BY A PROFESSIONAL MAGNETIZER
2159-179156-0003 HE WAS AT THAT TIME A FIRM BELIEVER IN THE THEORY OF PERSONAL MAGNETISM A DELUSION FROM WHICH HE AFTERWARD ESCAPED ON THE OCCASION WHICH HE DESCRIBES THE OPERATOR COMMANDED HIM TO CLOSE HIS EYES
2159-179156-0004 BUT HE DID OPEN THEM AT ONCE AGAIN HE TOLD HIM TO CLOSE THE EYES AND AT THE SAME TIME HE GENTLY STROKED HIS HEAD AND FACE AND EYELIDS WITH HIS HAND DOCTOR COCKE FANCIED HE FELT A TINGLING SENSATION IN HIS FOREHEAD AND EYES
2159-179156-0005 WHICH HE SUPPOSED CAME FROM THE HAND OF THE OPERATOR AFTERWARD HE CAME TO BELIEVE THAT THIS SENSATION WAS PURELY IMAGINARY ON HIS PART THEN HE SAYS A SENSATION AKIN TO FEAR CAME OVER ME
2159-179156-0006 THE OPERATOR SAID YOU ARE GOING TO SLEEP YOU ARE GETTING SLEEPY YOU CANNOT OPEN YOUR EYES I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT MY HEART WAS BEATING RAPIDLY AND I FELT A SENSATION OF TERROR
2159-179156-0007 HE THEN MADE PASSES OVER MY HEAD DOWN OVER MY HANDS AND BODY BUT DID NOT TOUCH ME HE THEN SAID TO ME YOU CANNOT OPEN YOUR EYES THE MOTOR APPARATUS OF MY LIDS WOULD NOT SEEMINGLY RESPOND TO MY WILL
2159-179156-0008 YET I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT WHILE ONE PART OF MY MIND WANTED TO OPEN MY EYES ANOTHER PART DID NOT WANT TO SO I WAS IN A PARADOXICAL STATE I BELIEVED THAT I COULD OPEN MY EYES AND YET COULD NOT
2159-179156-0009 THE FEELING OF NOT WISHING TO OPEN MY EYES WAS NOT BASED UPON ANY DESIRE TO PLEASE THE OPERATOR I HAD NO PERSONAL INTEREST IN HIM IN ANY WAY BUT BE IT UNDERSTOOD I FIRMLY BELIEVED IN HIS POWER TO CONTROL ME
2159-179156-0010 THEN HE STROKED THE ARM AND SAID IT WAS GROWING NUMB HE SAID YOU HAVE NO FEELING IN IT HAVE YOU DOCTOR COCKE GOES ON I SAID NO AND I KNEW THAT I SAID NO
2159-179156-0011 THE OPERATOR WENT ON PRICKING THE ARM WITH A PIN AND THOUGH DOCTOR COCKE FELT THE PAIN HE SAID HE DID NOT FEEL IT AND AT THE SAME TIME THE SENSATION OF TERROR INCREASED I WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF MY BODY AT ALL HE SAYS FURTHER ON
2159-179156-0012 BUT I WAS PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS OF THE TWO CONTRADICTORY ELEMENTS WITHIN ME I KNEW THAT MY BODY EXISTED BUT COULD NOT PROVE IT TO MYSELF I KNEW THAT THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE OPERATOR WERE IN A MEASURE UNTRUE
2159-179156-0013 I OBEYED THEM VOLUNTARILY AND INVOLUNTARILY THIS IS THE LAST REMEMBRANCE THAT I HAVE OF THAT HYPNOTIC EXPERIENCE AFTER THIS HOWEVER THE OPERATOR CAUSED THE DOCTOR TO DO A NUMBER OF THINGS WHICH HE LEARNED OF FROM HIS FRIENDS AFTER THE PERFORMANCE WAS OVER
2159-179156-0014 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE HYPNOTIST COMMANDED ME TO AWAKE AS SOON AS I DROPPED MY ARM AND YET TEN MINUTES OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS HAD PASSED ON A SUBSEQUENT OCCASION DOCTOR COCKE WHO WAS BLIND WAS PUT INTO A DEEP HYPNOTIC SLEEP
2159-179156-0015 BY FIXING HIS MIND ON THE NUMBER TWENTY SIX AND HOLDING UP HIS HAND THIS TIME HE EXPERIENCED A STILL GREATER DEGREE OF TERROR AND INCIDENTALLY LEARNED THAT HE COULD HYPNOTIZE HIMSELF THE MATTER OF SELF HYPNOTISM
2159-179156-0016 WE SHALL CONSIDER IN ANOTHER CHAPTER IN THIS CONNECTION WE FIND GREAT INTEREST IN AN ARTICLE IN THE MEDICAL NEWS JULY TWENTY EIGHTH EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
2159-179156-0017 IN WHICH HE DESCRIBES THE EFFECTS OF MUSIC UPON HYPNOTIC SUBJECTS WHILE IN VIENNA HE TOOK OCCASION TO OBSERVE CLOSELY THE ENTHUSIASTIC MUSICAL DEVOTEES AS THEY SAT IN THE AUDIENCE AT THE PERFORMANCE OF ONE OF WAGNER'S OPERAS
2159-179156-0018 HE BELIEVED THEY WERE IN A CONDITION OF SELF INDUCED HYPNOTISM IN WHICH THEIR SUBJECTIVE FACULTIES WERE SO EXALTED AS TO SUPERSEDE THEIR OBJECTIVE PERCEPTIONS MUSIC WAS NO LONGER TO THEM A SUCCESSION OF PLEASING SOUNDS
2159-179156-0019 BUT THE EMBODIMENT OF A DRAMA IN WHICH THEY BECAME SO WRAPPED UP THAT THEY FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE MECHANICAL AND EXTERNAL FEATURES OF THE MUSIC AND LIVED COMPLETELY IN A FAIRY WORLD OF DREAM
2159-179156-0020 THIS OBSERVATION SUGGESTED TO HIM AN INTERESTING SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS HIS FIRST SUBJECT WAS EASILY HYPNOTIZED AND OF AN EMOTIONAL NATURE WAGNER'S
2159-179156-0021 WAS PLAYED FROM THE PIANO SCORE THE PULSE OF THE SUBJECT BECAME MORE RAPID AND AT FIRST OF HIGHER TENSION INCREASING FROM A NORMAL RATE OF SIXTY BEATS A MINUTE TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THEN
2159-179156-0022 AS THE MUSIC PROGRESSED THE TENSION DIMINISHED THE RESPIRATION INCREASED FROM EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY PER MINUTE GREAT EXCITEMENT IN THE SUBJECT WAS EVIDENT HIS WHOLE BODY WAS THROWN INTO MOTION HIS LEGS WERE DRAWN UP HIS ARMS TOSSED INTO THE AIR
2159-179156-0023 THE STATE OF MIND BROUGHT UP BEFORE HIM IN THE MOST REALISTIC AND VIVID MANNER POSSIBLE THE PICTURE OF THE RIDE OF TAM O'SHANTER WHICH HE HAD SEEN YEARS BEFORE THE PICTURE
2159-179156-0024 SOON BECAME REAL TO HIM AND HE FOUND HIMSELF TAKING PART IN A WILD CHASE NOT AS WITCH DEVIL OR TAM EVEN BUT IN SOME WAY HIS CONSCIOUSNESS WAS SPREAD THROUGH EVERY PART OF THE SCENE BEING OF IT
2159-179156-0025 AND YET PLAYING THE PART OF SPECTATOR AS IS OFTEN THE CASE IN DREAMS DOCTOR WARTHIN TRIED THE SAME EXPERIMENT AGAIN THIS TIME ON A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS NOT SO EMOTIONAL AND WAS HYPNOTIZED WITH MUCH MORE DIFFICULTY
2159-179156-0026 THIS SUBJECT DID NOT PASS INTO SUCH A DEEP STATE OF HYPNOTISM BUT THE RESULT WAS PRACTICALLY THE SAME THE PULSE RATE ROSE FROM SEVENTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THE SENSATION REMEMBERED WAS THAT OF RIDING FURIOUSLY THROUGH THE AIR
2159-179156-0027 THE EXPERIMENT WAS REPEATED ON OTHER SUBJECTS IN ALL CASES WITH THE SAME RESULT
2159-179156-0028 TO HIM IT ALWAYS EXPRESSED THE PICTURED WILD RIDE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF WOTAN THE SUBJECT TAKING PART IN THE RIDE IT WAS NOTICEABLE IN EACH CASE THAT THE SAME MUSIC PLAYED TO THEM IN THE WAKING STATE PRODUCED NO SPECIAL IMPRESSION
2159-179156-0029 AT FIRST IT SEEMED TO PRODUCE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT FOR THE PULSE WAS LOWERED LATER IT ROSE TO A RATE DOUBLE THE NORMAL AND THE TENSION WAS DIMINISHED THE IMPRESSION DESCRIBED BY THE SUBJECT AFTERWARD
2159-179156-0030 AND THE SUBJECT SEEMED TO CONTEMPLATE A LANDSCAPE OF LOFTY GRANDEUR A DIFFERENT SORT OF MUSIC WAS PLAYED
2159-179156-0031 APPEARS TO SUMMON SIGMUND TO VALHALLA
2159-179156-0032 IT BECAME SLOW AND IRREGULAR AND VERY SMALL THE RESPIRATION DECREASED ALMOST TO GASPING THE FACE GREW PALE AND A COLD PERSPIRATION BROKE OUT READERS WHO ARE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN THIS SUBJECT
2159-179156-0033 WILL FIND DESCRIPTIONS OF MANY OTHER INTERESTING EXPERIMENTS IN THE SAME ARTICLE DOCTOR COCKE DESCRIBES A PECULIAR TRICK HE PLAYED UPON THE SIGHT OF A SUBJECT SAYS HE I ONCE HYPNOTIZED A MAN
2159-179156-0034 AND CALL THE LETTERS AS I DIRECTED STIMULATION WAS IN THIS CASE IMPOSSIBLE AS I MADE HIM READ FIFTEEN OR TWENTY PAGES HE CALLING THE LETTERS AS SUGGESTED EACH TIME THEY OCCURRED THE EXTRAORDINARY HEIGHTENING
2159-179156-0035 AND CLAIRVOYANCE IF THE POWERS OF THE MIND ARE SO ENORMOUSLY INCREASED ALL THAT IS REQUIRED OF A VERY SENSITIVE AND EASILY HYPNOTIZED PERSON IS TO HYPNOTIZE HIM OR HERSELF WHEN HE WILL BE ABLE TO READ THOUGHTS
2159-179157-0000 AND IT IS TRUE THAT A PERSON CAN DELIBERATELY HYPNOTIZE HIMSELF WHEN HE WISHES TO TILL HE HAS BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO IT AND IS EXPERT IN IT SO TO SPEAK IT DOES AWAY AT A STROKE WITH THE CLAIMS OF ALL PROFESSIONAL HYPNOTISTS AND MAGNETIC HEALERS
2159-179157-0001 THAT THEY HAVE ANY PECULIAR POWER IN THEMSELVES WHICH THEY EXERT OVER THEIR FELLOWS ONE OF THESE PROFESSIONALS GIVES AN ACCOUNT IN HIS BOOK OF WHAT HE CALLS THE WONDERFUL LOCK METHOD HE SAYS THAT
2159-179157-0002 THOUGH HE IS LOCKED UP IN A SEPARATE ROOM HE CAN MAKE THE PSYCHIC POWER WORK THROUGH THE WALLS ALL THAT HE DOES IS TO PUT HIS SUBJECTS IN THE WAY OF HYPNOTIZING THEMSELVES
2159-179157-0003 HE SHOWS HIS INCONSISTENCY WHEN HE STATES THAT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THE HYPNOTIZER IS IN DANGER OF BECOMING HYPNOTIZED HIMSELF IN THIS HE MAKES NO CLAIM THAT THE SUBJECT IS USING ANY PSYCHIC POWER
2159-179157-0004 BUT OF COURSE IF THE HYPNOTIZER LOOKS STEADILY INTO THE EYES OF HIS SUBJECT AND THE SUBJECT LOOKS INTO HIS EYES THE STEADY GAZE ON A BRIGHT OBJECT WILL PRODUCE HYPNOTISM IN ONE QUITE AS READILY AS IN THE OTHER
2159-179157-0005 HYPNOTISM IS AN ESTABLISHED SCIENTIFIC FACT BUT THE CLAIM THAT THE HYPNOTIZER HAS ANY MYSTERIOUS PSYCHIC POWER IS THE INVARIABLE MARK OF THE CHARLATAN
2159-179157-0006 PROBABLY NO SCIENTIFIC PHENOMENON WAS EVER SO GROSSLY PROSTITUTED TO BASE ENDS AS THAT OF HYPNOTISM LATER WE SHALL SEE SOME OF THE OUTRAGEOUS FORMS THIS CHARLATANISM ASSUMES
2159-179157-0007 AND HOW IT EXTENDS TO THE PROFESSIONAL SUBJECTS AS WELL AS TO THE PROFESSIONAL OPERATORS TILL THOSE SUBJECTS EVEN IMPOSE UPON SCIENTIFIC MEN WHO OUGHT TO BE PROOF AGAINST SUCH DECEPTION
2159-179157-0008 MOREOVER THE POSSIBILITY OF SELF HYPNOTIZATION CAREFULLY CONCEALED AND CALLED BY ANOTHER NAME OPENS ANOTHER GREAT FIELD OF HUMBUG AND CHARLATANISM OF WHICH THE ADVERTISING COLUMNS OF THE NEWSPAPERS ARE CONSTANTLY FILLED
2159-179157-0009 NAMELY THAT OF THE CLAIRVOYANT AND MEDIUM WE MAY CONCEIVE HOW SUCH A PROFESSION MIGHT BECOME PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE AND HIGHLY USEFUL BUT AT PRESENT IT SEEMS AS IF ANY PERSON WHO WENT INTO IT
2159-179157-0010 HOWEVER HONEST HE MIGHT BE AT THE START SOON BEGAN TO DECEIVE HIMSELF AS WELL AS OTHERS UNTIL HE LOST HIS POWER ENTIRELY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FACT AND IMAGINATION BEFORE DISCUSSING THE MATTER FURTHER
2159-179157-0011 LET US QUOTE DOCTOR COCKE'S EXPERIMENT IN HYPNOTIZING HIMSELF IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT A PROFESSIONAL HYPNOTIZER OR MAGNETIZER HAD HYPNOTIZED HIM BY TELLING HIM TO FIX HIS MIND ON THE NUMBER TWENTY SIX AND HOLDING UP HIS HAND
2159-179157-0012 I WAS INTENSELY COLD MY HEART SEEMED TO STAND STILL I HAD RINGING IN MY EARS MY HAIR SEEMED TO RISE UPON MY SCALP I PERSISTED IN THE EFFORT AND THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED NOISE IN MY EARS GREW LOUDER AND LOUDER
2159-179157-0013 THE ROAR BECAME DEAFENING IT CRACKLED LIKE A MIGHTY FIRE I WAS FEARFULLY CONSCIOUS OF MYSELF HAVING READ VIVID ACCOUNTS OF DREAMS VISIONS ET CETERA IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I WOULD EXPERIENCE THEM
2159-179157-0014 I FELT IN A VAGUE WAY THAT THERE WERE BEINGS ALL ABOUT ME BUT COULD NOT HEAR THEIR VOICES I FELT AS THOUGH EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY WAS FIXED AND RIGID
2159-179157-0015 THE ROAR IN MY EARS GREW LOUDER STILL AND I HEARD ABOVE THE ROAR REPORTS WHICH SOUNDED LIKE ARTILLERY AND MUSKETRY THEN ABOVE THE DIN OF THE NOISE A MUSICAL CHORD I SEEMED TO BE ABSORBED IN THIS CHORD I KNEW NOTHING ELSE
2159-179157-0016 SECONDLY I WISHED TO BE HYPNOTIZED THESE TOGETHER WITH A VIVID IMAGINATION AND STRAINED ATTENTION BROUGHT ON THE STATES WHICH OCCURRED
2159-179157-0017 HIS DESCRIPTIONS OF DREAMS BEAR A WONDERFUL LIKENESS TO DE QUINCEY'S DREAMS SUCH AS THOSE DESCRIBED IN THE ENGLISH MAIL COACH DE PROFUNDIS AND THE CONFESSIONS OF AN ENGLISH OPIUM EATER
2159-179157-0018 ALL OF WHICH WERE PRESUMABLY DUE TO OPIUM THE CAUSES WHICH DOCTOR COCKE THINKS PRODUCED THE HYPNOTIC CONDITION IN HIS CASE NAMELY BELIEF DESIRE TO BE HYPNOTIZED AND STRAINED ATTENTION UNITED WITH A VIVID IMAGINATION
2159-179157-0019 ARE CAUSES WHICH ARE OFTEN FOUND IN CONJUNCTION AND PRODUCE EFFECTS WHICH WE MAY REASONABLY EXPLAIN ON THE THEORY OF SELF HYPNOTIZATION
2159-179157-0020 FOR INSTANCE THE EFFECTS OF AN EXCITING RELIGIOUS REVIVAL ARE VERY LIKE THOSE PRODUCED BY MESMER'S OPERATIONS IN PARIS THE SUBJECTS BECOME HYSTERICAL AND ARE READY TO BELIEVE ANYTHING OR DO ANYTHING
2159-179157-0021 BY PROLONGING THE OPERATION A WHOLE COMMUNITY BECOMES MORE OR LESS HYPNOTIZED IN ALL SUCH CASES HOWEVER UNUSUAL EXCITEMENT IS COMMONLY FOLLOWED BY UNUSUAL LETHARGY
2159-179157-0022 IN FACT IT IS A SORT OF INTOXICATION THE SAME PHENOMENA ARE PROBABLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR MANY OF THE STRANGE RECORDS OF HISTORY THE WONDERFUL CURES AT LOURDES OF WHICH WE HAVE READ IN ZOLA'S NOVEL OF THAT NAME
2159-179157-0023 ARE NO DOUBT THE EFFECT OF HYPNOTIZATION BY THE PRIESTS SOME OF THE STRANGE MOVEMENTS OF WHOLE COMMUNITIES DURING THE CRUSADES ARE TO BE EXPLAINED EITHER ON THE THEORY OF HYPNOTIZATION OR OF CONTAGION
2159-179157-0024 AND POSSIBLY THESE TWO THINGS WILL TURN OUT TO BE MUCH THE SAME IN FACT ON NO OTHER GROUND CAN WE EXPLAIN THE SO CALLED CHILDREN'S CRUSADE IN WHICH OVER THIRTY THOUSAND CHILDREN FROM GERMANY FROM ALL CLASSES OF THE COMMUNITY
2159-179157-0025 TRIED TO CROSS THE ALPS IN WINTER AND IN THEIR STRUGGLES WERE ALL LOST OR SOLD INTO SLAVERY WITHOUT EVEN REACHING THE HOLY LAND AGAIN HYPNOTISM IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR MANY OF THE POET'S DREAMS
2159-179157-0026 GAZING STEADILY AT A BED OF BRIGHT COALS OR A STREAM OF RUNNING WATER WILL INVARIABLY THROW A SENSITIVE SUBJECT INTO A HYPNOTIC SLEEP THAT WILL LAST SOMETIMES FOR SEVERAL HOURS DOCTOR COCKE SAYS
2159-179157-0027 THAT HE HAS EXPERIMENTED IN THIS DIRECTION WITH PATIENTS OF HIS SAYS HE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO RESIST THE STATE OR TO BRING IT AT WILL MANY OF THEM DESCRIBE BEAUTIFUL SCENES FROM NATURE OR SOME MIGHTY CATHEDRAL
2159-179157-0028 WITH ITS LOFTY DOME OR THE FACES OF IMAGINARY BEINGS BEAUTIFUL OR DEMONIACAL ACCORDING TO THE WILL AND TEMPER OF THE SUBJECT PERHAPS THE MOST WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF SELF HYPNOTISM WHICH WE HAVE IN HISTORY
2159-179157-0029 IS THAT OF THE MYSTIC SWEDENBORG WHO SAW SUCH STRANGE THINGS IN HIS VISIONS AND AT LAST CAME TO BELIEVE IN THEM AS REAL THE SAME EXPLANATION MAY BE GIVEN OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF ORIENTAL PROPHETS
2159-179157-0030 FOR IN THE ORIENT HYPNOTISM IS MUCH EASIER AND MORE SYSTEMATICALLY DEVELOPED THAN WITH US OF THE WEST THE PERFORMANCES OF THE DERVISHES AND ALSO OF THE FAKIRS WHO WOUND THEMSELVES AND PERFORM MANY WONDERFUL FEATS
2159-179157-0031 THEIR IMPERSONATIONS ARE RIDICULOUS IN THE EXTREME ONE MAN I REMEMBER BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE SPIRIT OF CHARLES SUMNER BEING UNEDUCATED HE USED THE MOST WRETCHED ENGLISH
2159-179157-0032 AND HIS LANGUAGE WAS UTTERLY DEVOID OF SENSE WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND A VERY INTELLIGENT LADY WHO BELIEVED HERSELF TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE SPIRIT OF CHARLOTTE CUSHMAN PERSONATED THE PART VERY WELL DOCTOR COOKE SAYS OF HIMSELF
2159-179157-0033 I CAN HYPNOTIZE MYSELF TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT I WILL BECOME WHOLLY UNCONSCIOUS OF EVENTS TAKING PLACE AROUND ME AND A LONG INTERVAL OF TIME SAY FROM ONE HALF TO TWO HOURS WILL BE A COMPLETE BLANK
226-122538-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN IN DERYCK'S SAFE CONTROL THE WHITE CLIFFS OF DOVER GRADUALLY BECAME MORE SOLID AND DISTINCT UNTIL AT LENGTH THEY ROSE FROM THE SEA A STRONG WHITE WALL
226-122538-0001 EMBLEM OF THE UNDENIABLE PURITY OF ENGLAND THE STAINLESS HONOUR AND INTEGRITY OF HER THRONE HER CHURCH HER PARLIAMENT HER COURTS OF JUSTICE AND HER DEALINGS AT HOME AND ABROAD WHETHER WITH FRIEND OR FOE
226-122538-0002 STRENGTH AND WHITENESS THOUGHT JANE AS SHE PACED THE STEAMER'S DECK AND AFTER A TWO YEARS ABSENCE HER HEART WENT OUT TO HER NATIVE LAND THEN DOVER CASTLE CAUGHT HER EYE SO BEAUTIFUL IN THE PEARLY LIGHT OF THAT SPRING AFTERNOON
226-122538-0003 AN HOUR AFTER SHE HAD READ IT SHE WAS DRIVING DOWN THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD TO CAIRO EMBARKED AT ALEXANDRIA THE NEXT DAY LANDED AT BRINDISI
226-122538-0004 AND THIS NIGHT AND DAY TRAVELLING HAD BROUGHT HER AT LAST WITHIN SIGHT OF THE SHORES OF ENGLAND IN A FEW MINUTES SHE WOULD SET FOOT UPON THEM AND THEN THERE WOULD BE BUT TWO MORE STAGES TO HER JOURNEY FOR FROM THE MOMENT SHE STARTED
226-122538-0005 JANE NEVER DOUBTED HER ULTIMATE DESTINATION THE ROOM WHERE PAIN AND DARKNESS AND DESPAIR MUST BE WAGING SO TERRIBLE A CONFLICT AGAINST THE MORAL COURAGE THE MENTAL SANITY AND THE INSTINCTIVE HOLD ON LIFE OF THE MAN SHE LOVED
226-122538-0006 THAT SHE WAS GOING TO HIM JANE KNEW BUT SHE FELT UTTERLY UNABLE TO ARRANGE HOW OR IN WHAT WAY HER GOING COULD BE MANAGED THAT IT WAS A COMPLICATED PROBLEM HER COMMON SENSE TOLD HER
226-122538-0007 AND THAT HER SUREST WAY TO GARTH LAY THROUGH THE DOCTOR'S CONSULTING ROOM SO SHE TELEGRAPHED TO DERYCK FROM PARIS AND AT PRESENT HER MIND SAW NO FURTHER THAN WIMPOLE STREET AT DOVER SHE BOUGHT A PAPER
226-122538-0008 AND HASTILY SCANNED ITS PAGES AS SHE WALKED ALONG THE PLATFORM IN THE WAKE OF THE CAPABLE PORTER WHO HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER RUGS AND HAND BAGGAGE IN THE PERSONAL COLUMN SHE FOUND THE VERY PARAGRAPH SHE SOUGHT
226-122538-0009 BUT THE INJURED PARTS WERE PROGRESSING FAVOURABLY AND ALL FEAR OF BRAIN COMPLICATIONS SEEMED OVER DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS HOWEVER A SERIOUS REACTION FROM SHOCK HAS SET IN AND IT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO SUMMON SIR DERYCK BRAND
226-122538-0010 THE WELL KNOWN NERVE SPECIALIST IN CONSULTATION WITH THE OCULIST AND THE LOCAL PRACTITIONER IN CHARGE OF THE CASE THERE IS A FEELING OF WIDE SPREAD REGRET AND SYMPATHY IN THOSE SOCIAL AND ARTISTIC CIRCLES WHERE MISTER DALMAIN WAS SO WELL KNOWN AND SO DESERVEDLY POPULAR
226-122538-0011 THAT JANE'S HALF CROWN WAS NOT A PENNY HE HAD A SICK YOUNG WIFE AT HOME WHO HAD BEEN ORDERED EXTRA NOURISHMENT AND JUST AS THE RUSH ON BOARD BEGAN HE HAD PUT UP A SIMPLE PRAYER TO THE HEAVENLY FATHER
226-122538-0012 WHO KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS ASKING THAT HE MIGHT CATCH THE EYE OF A GENEROUS TRAVELLER HE FELT HE HAD INDEED BEEN LED TO THIS PLAIN BROWN FACED BROAD SHOULDERED LADY WHEN HE REMEMBERED HOW NEARLY
226-122538-0013 AFTER HER CURT NOD FROM A DISTANCE HAD ENGAGED HIM HE HAD RESPONDED TO THE BLANDISHMENTS OF A FUSSY LITTLE WOMAN WITH MANY MORE BAGS AND RUGS AND A PARROT CAGE WHO WAS NOW DOLING FRENCH COPPERS OUT OF THE WINDOW OF THE NEXT COMPARTMENT
226-122538-0014 SEVEN PENCE APENNY OF THIS STUFF AIN'T MUCH FOR CARRYING ALL THAT ALONG I DON'T THINK GRUMBLED HIS MATE AND JANE'S YOUNG PORTER EXPERIENCED THE DOUBLE JOY OF FAITH CONFIRMED AND WILLING SERVICE GENEROUSLY REWARDED A TELEGRAPH BOY WALKED ALONG THE TRAIN SAYING
226-122538-0015 HAVE COFFEE AT DOVER DERYCK JANE GAVE ONE HARD TEARLESS SOB OF THANKFULNESS AND RELIEF SHE HAD BEEN SO LONELY THEN SHE TURNED TO THE WINDOW HERE SOMEBODY FETCH ME A CUP OF COFFEE WILL YOU
226-122538-0016 AND JUST AS THE TRAIN BEGAN TO MOVE HANDED A CUP OF STEAMING COFFEE AND A PLATE OF BREAD AND BUTTER IN AT THE WINDOW OH THANK YOU MY GOOD FELLOW SAID JANE PUTTING THE PLATE ON THE SEAT WHILE SHE DIVED INTO HER POCKET
226-122538-0017 HERE YOU HAVE DONE VERY WELL FOR ME NO NEVER MIND THE CHANGE COFFEE AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE SHOULD FETCH A FANCY PRICE GOOD BYE THE TRAIN MOVED ON AND THE PORTER STOOD LOOKING AFTER IT WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES
226-122538-0018 OVER THE FIRST HALF CROWN HE HAD SAID TO HIMSELF MILK AND NEW LAID EGGS NOW AS HE POCKETED THE SECOND HE ADDED THE OTHER TWO THINGS MENTIONED BY THE PARISH DOCTOR SOUP AND JELLY AND HIS HEART GLOWED
226-122538-0019 YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS AND JANE SEATED IN A COMFORTABLE CORNER CHOKED BACK THE TEARS OF RELIEF WHICH THREATENED TO FALL DRANK HER COFFEE AND WAS THEREBY MORE REVIVED THAN SHE COULD HAVE THOUGHT POSSIBLE
226-122538-0020 SHE READ HIS TELEGRAM THROUGH ONCE MORE AND SMILED HOW LIKE HIM TO THINK OF THE COFFEE AND OH HOW LIKE HIM TO BE COMING TO THE STATION SHE TOOK OFF HER HAT AND LEANED BACK AGAINST THE CUSHIONS
226-122538-0021 SHE HAD BEEN TRAVELLING NIGHT AND DAY IN ONE FEVERISH WHIRL OF HASTE AND AT LAST SHE HAD BROUGHT HERSELF WITHIN REACH OF DERYCK'S HAND AND DERYCK'S SAFE CONTROL THE TURMOIL OF HER SOUL WAS STILLED
226-122538-0022 A GREAT CALM TOOK ITS PLACE AND JANE DROPPED QUIETLY OFF TO SLEEP YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS WASHED AND BRUSHED AND GREATLY REFRESHED
226-122538-0023 JANE STOOD AT THE WINDOW OF HER COMPARTMENT AS THE TRAIN STEAMED INTO CHARING CROSS THE DOCTOR WAS STATIONED EXACTLY OPPOSITE THE DOOR WHEN HER CARRIAGE CAME TO A STANDSTILL
226-122538-0024 MERE CHANCE AND YET TO JANE IT SEEMED SO LIKE HIM TO HAVE TAKEN UP HIS POSITION PRECISELY AT THE RIGHT SPOT ON THAT LONG PLATFORM AN ENTHUSIASTIC LADY PATIENT HAD ONCE SAID OF DERYCK BRAND WITH MORE ACCURACY OF DEFINITION THAN OF GRAMMAR
226-122538-0025 YOU KNOW HE IS ALWAYS SO VERY JUST THERE AND THIS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DOCTOR HAD MADE HIM TO MANY A VERY PRESENT HELP IN TIME OF TROUBLE HE WAS THROUGH THE LINE OF PORTERS AND HAD HIS HAND UPON THE HANDLE OF JANE'S DOOR IN A MOMENT
226-122538-0026 STANDING AT THE WINDOW SHE TOOK ONE LOOK AT THE FIRM LEAN FACE NOW ALIGHT WITH WELCOME AND READ IN THE KIND STEADFAST EYES OF HER CHILDHOOD'S FRIEND A PERFECT SYMPATHY AND COMPREHENSION THEN SHE SAW BEHIND HIM HER AUNT'S FOOTMAN
226-122538-0027 AND HER OWN MAID WHO HAD BEEN GIVEN A PLACE IN THE DUCHESS'S HOUSEHOLD IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE WAS ON THE PLATFORM AND HER HAND WAS IN DERYCK'S THAT IS RIGHT DEAR HE SAID ALL FIT AND WELL I CAN SEE NOW HAND OVER YOUR KEYS
226-122538-0028 I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE NOTHING CONTRABAND I TELEPHONED THE DUCHESS TO SEND SOME OF HER PEOPLE TO MEET YOUR LUGGAGE AND NOT TO EXPECT YOU HERSELF UNTIL DINNER TIME AS YOU WERE TAKING TEA WITH US WAS THAT RIGHT THIS WAY COME OUTSIDE THE BARRIER WHAT A RABBLE
226-122538-0029 ALL WANTING TO BREAK EVERY POSSIBLE RULE AND REGULATION AND EACH TRYING TO BE THE FIRST PERSON IN THE FRONT ROW REALLY THE PATIENCE AND GOOD TEMPER OF RAILWAY OFFICIALS SHOULD TEACH THE REST OF MANKIND A LESSON THE DOCTOR TALKING ALL THE TIME
226-122538-0030 PILOTED JANE THROUGH THE CROWD OPENED THE DOOR OF A NEAT ELECTRIC BROUGHAM HELPED HER IN TOOK HIS SEAT BESIDE HER AND THEY GLIDED SWIFTLY OUT INTO THE STRAND AND TURNED TOWARDS TRAFALGAR SQUARE
226-122538-0031 WELL SAID THE DOCTOR NIAGARA IS A BIG THING ISN'T IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY TO ME WERE YOU NOT DISAPPOINTED IN NIAGARA WE WERE I FEEL TEMPTED TO WISH FOR ONE HOMICIDAL MOMENT THAT THE EARTH WOULD OPEN HER MOUTH AND SWALLOW THEM UP
226-122538-0032 PEOPLE WHO CAN BE DISAPPOINTED IN NIAGARA AND TALK ABOUT IT SHOULD NO LONGER BE ALLOWED TO CRAWL ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND HOW ABOUT THE LITTLE MOTHER ISN'T SHE WORTH KNOWING I HOPE SHE SENT ME HER LOVE AND NEW YORK HARBOUR
226-122538-0033 HE WILL ALWAYS BE BLIND DEAR BUT LIFE HOLDS OTHER THINGS BESIDE SIGHT WE MUST NEVER SAY NO HOPE WILL HE LIVE THERE IS NO REASON HE SHOULD NOT LIVE
226-122538-0034 BUT HOW FAR LIFE WILL BE WORTH LIVING LARGELY DEPENDS UPON WHAT CAN BE DONE FOR HIM POOR CHAP DURING THE NEXT FEW MONTHS HE IS MORE SHATTERED MENTALLY THAN PHYSICALLY
226-131532-0000 WHEN ALL WERE GONE I LEARNT THAT THE VILE SLANDER HAD INDEED BEEN CIRCULATED THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY IN THE VERY PRESENCE OF THE VICTIM ROSE HOWEVER VOWED SHE DID NOT AND WOULD NOT BELIEVE IT
226-131532-0001 AND MY MOTHER MADE THE SAME DECLARATION THOUGH NOT I FEAR WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF REAL UNWAVERING INCREDULITY IT SEEMED TO DWELL CONTINUALLY ON HER MIND AND SHE KEPT IRRITATING ME FROM TIME TO TIME BY SUCH EXPRESSIONS AS
226-131532-0002 THE FOUNDATION IS IN THE WICKEDNESS AND FALSEHOOD OF THE WORLD SAID I AND IN THE FACT THAT MISTER LAWRENCE HAS BEEN SEEN TO GO THAT WAY ONCE OR TWICE OF AN EVENING AND THE VILLAGE GOSSIPS SAY HE GOES TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO THE STRANGE LADY
226-131532-0003 AND THE SCANDAL MONGERS HAVE GREEDILY SEIZED THE RUMOUR TO MAKE IT THE BASIS OF THEIR OWN INFERNAL STRUCTURE WELL BUT GILBERT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN HER MANNER TO COUNTENANCE SUCH REPORTS DID YOU SEE ANYTHING IN HER MANNER
226-131532-0004 NO CERTAINLY BUT THEN YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SAID THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT HER I BELIEVE IT WAS ON THAT VERY EVENING THAT I VENTURED ON ANOTHER INVASION OF WILDFELL HALL FROM THE TIME OF OUR PARTY
226-131532-0005 WHICH WAS UPWARDS OF A WEEK AGO I HAD BEEN MAKING DAILY EFFORTS TO MEET ITS MISTRESS IN HER WALKS AND ALWAYS DISAPPOINTED SHE MUST HAVE MANAGED IT SO ON PURPOSE HAD NIGHTLY KEPT REVOLVING IN MY MIND SOME PRETEXT FOR ANOTHER CALL
226-131532-0006 AT LENGTH I CONCLUDED THAT THE SEPARATION COULD BE ENDURED NO LONGER BY THIS TIME YOU WILL SEE I WAS PRETTY FAR GONE AND TAKING FROM THE BOOK CASE AN OLD VOLUME THAT I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN
226-131532-0007 THOUGH FROM ITS UNSIGHTLY AND SOMEWHAT DILAPIDATED CONDITION I HAD NOT YET VENTURED TO OFFER IT FOR PERUSAL I HASTENED AWAY BUT NOT WITHOUT SUNDRY MISGIVINGS AS TO HOW SHE WOULD RECEIVE ME
226-131532-0008 OR HOW I COULD SUMMON COURAGE TO PRESENT MYSELF WITH SO SLIGHT AN EXCUSE BUT PERHAPS I MIGHT SEE HER IN THE FIELD OR THE GARDEN AND THEN THERE WOULD BE NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IT WAS THE FORMAL KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
226-131532-0009 WITH THE PROSPECT OF BEING GRAVELY USHERED IN BY RACHEL TO THE PRESENCE OF A SURPRISED UNCORDIAL MISTRESS THAT SO GREATLY DISTURBED ME MY WISH HOWEVER WAS NOT GRATIFIED
226-131532-0010 MISSUS GRAHAM HERSELF WAS NOT TO BE SEEN BUT THERE WAS ARTHUR PLAYING WITH HIS FROLICSOME LITTLE DOG IN THE GARDEN I LOOKED OVER THE GATE AND CALLED HIM TO ME HE WANTED ME TO COME IN BUT I TOLD HIM I COULD NOT WITHOUT HIS MOTHER'S LEAVE
226-131532-0011 HE RAN TO PERFORM MY BIDDING AND QUICKLY RETURNED WITH HIS MOTHER HOW LOVELY SHE LOOKED WITH HER DARK RINGLETS STREAMING IN THE LIGHT SUMMER BREEZE HER FAIR CHEEK SLIGHTLY FLUSHED AND HER COUNTENANCE RADIANT WITH SMILES
226-131532-0012 THERE IS NO MEDIATOR LIKE A MERRY SIMPLE HEARTED CHILD EVER READY TO CEMENT DIVIDED HEARTS TO SPAN THE UNFRIENDLY GULF OF CUSTOM TO MELT THE ICE OF COLD RESERVE AND OVERTHROW THE SEPARATING WALLS OF DREAD FORMALITY AND PRIDE
226-131532-0013 WELL MISTER MARKHAM WHAT IS IT SAID THE YOUNG MOTHER ACCOSTING ME WITH A PLEASANT SMILE I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THIS BOOK AND IF YOU PLEASE TO TAKE IT AND PERUSE IT AT YOUR LEISURE
226-131532-0014 I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR CALLING YOU OUT ON SUCH A LOVELY EVENING THOUGH IT BE FOR A MATTER OF NO GREATER IMPORTANCE TELL HIM TO COME IN MAMMA SAID ARTHUR WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME IN ASKED THE LADY YES
226-131532-0015 I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOUR IMPROVEMENTS IN THE GARDEN AND HOW YOUR SISTER'S ROOTS HAVE PROSPERED IN MY CHARGE ADDED SHE AS SHE OPENED THE GATE AND WE SAUNTERED THROUGH THE GARDEN AND TALKED OF THE FLOWERS THE TREES AND THE BOOK
226-131532-0016 AND THEN OF OTHER THINGS THE EVENING WAS KIND AND GENIAL AND SO WAS MY COMPANION BY DEGREES I WAXED MORE WARM AND TENDER THAN PERHAPS I HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE
226-131532-0017 BUT STILL I SAID NOTHING TANGIBLE AND SHE ATTEMPTED NO REPULSE UNTIL IN PASSING A MOSS ROSE TREE THAT I HAD BROUGHT HER SOME WEEKS SINCE IN MY SISTER'S NAME
226-131532-0018 AND I SAW A FLASH OF ECSTATIC BRILLIANCE IN HER EYE A GLOW OF GLAD EXCITEMENT ON HER FACE I THOUGHT MY HOUR OF VICTORY WAS COME BUT INSTANTLY A PAINFUL RECOLLECTION SEEMED TO FLASH UPON HER
226-131532-0019 A CLOUD OF ANGUISH DARKENED HER BROW A MARBLE PALENESS BLANCHED HER CHEEK AND LIP THERE SEEMED A MOMENT OF INWARD CONFLICT AND WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT SHE WITHDREW HER HAND AND RETREATED A STEP OR TWO BACK
226-131532-0020 NOW MISTER MARKHAM SAID SHE WITH A KIND OF DESPERATE CALMNESS I MUST TELL YOU PLAINLY THAT I CANNOT DO WITH THIS I LIKE YOUR COMPANY BECAUSE I AM ALONE HERE
226-131532-0021 AND LET ME ALONE HEREAFTER IN FACT WE MUST BE STRANGERS FOR THE FUTURE I WILL THEN BE YOUR FRIEND OR BROTHER OR ANYTHING YOU WISH IF YOU WILL ONLY LET ME CONTINUE TO SEE YOU BUT TELL ME WHY I CANNOT BE ANYTHING MORE
226-131532-0022 THERE WAS A PERPLEXED AND THOUGHTFUL PAUSE IS IT IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME RASH VOW IT IS SOMETHING OF THE KIND SHE ANSWERED SOME DAY I MAY TELL YOU BUT AT PRESENT YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE ME
226-131532-0023 AND NEVER GILBERT PUT ME TO THE PAINFUL NECESSITY OF REPEATING WHAT I HAVE JUST NOW SAID TO YOU SHE EARNESTLY ADDED GIVING ME HER HAND IN SERIOUS KINDNESS HOW SWEET HOW MUSICAL MY OWN NAME SOUNDED IN HER MOUTH
226-131532-0024 I WILL NOT I REPLIED BUT YOU PARDON THIS OFFENCE ON CONDITION THAT YOU NEVER REPEAT IT AND MAY I COME TO SEE YOU NOW AND THEN PERHAPS OCCASIONALLY
226-131532-0025 PROVIDED YOU NEVER ABUSE THE PRIVILEGE I MAKE NO EMPTY PROMISES BUT YOU SHALL SEE THE MOMENT YOU DO OUR INTIMACY IS AT AN END THAT'S ALL AND WILL YOU ALWAYS CALL ME GILBERT
226-131532-0026 BUT AS I WENT THE TRAMP OF HORSES HOOFS FELL ON MY EAR AND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF THE DEWY EVENING AND LOOKING TOWARDS THE LANE I SAW A SOLITARY EQUESTRIAN COMING UP INCLINING TO DUSK AS IT WAS
226-131532-0027 AND SEEMED INCLINED TO TURN BACK BUT ON SECOND THOUGHT APPARENTLY JUDGED IT BETTER TO CONTINUE HIS COURSE AS BEFORE HE ACCOSTED ME WITH A SLIGHT BOW AND EDGING CLOSE TO THE WALL ENDEAVOURED TO PASS ON BUT I WAS NOT SO MINDED
226-131532-0028 YOU AND YOUR PONY BE WHAT MAKES YOU SO COARSE AND BRUTAL MARKHAM I'M QUITE ASHAMED OF YOU YOU ANSWER MY QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU LEAVE THIS SPOT I WILL KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY THIS PERFIDIOUS DUPLICITY
226-131532-0029 IF YOU STAND TILL MORNING NOW THEN SAID I UNCLOSING MY HAND BUT STILL STANDING BEFORE HIM ASK ME SOME OTHER TIME WHEN YOU CAN SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN RETURNED HE AND HE MADE AN EFFORT TO PASS ME AGAIN
226-131532-0030 BUT I QUICKLY RE CAPTURED THE PONY SCARCE LESS ASTONISHED THAN ITS MASTER AT SUCH UNCIVIL USAGE REALLY MISTER MARKHAM THIS IS TOO MUCH SAID THE LATTER CAN I NOT GO TO SEE MY TENANT ON MATTERS OF BUSINESS WITHOUT BEING ASSAULTED IN THIS MANNER BY
226-131532-0031 AND IN TRUTH THE VICAR WAS JUST BEHIND ME PLODDING HOMEWARD FROM SOME REMOTE CORNER OF HIS PARISH I IMMEDIATELY RELEASED THE SQUIRE AND HE WENT ON HIS WAY SALUTING MISTER MILLWARD AS HE PASSED
226-131532-0032 WHAT QUARRELLING MARKHAM CRIED THE LATTER ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO ME
226-131532-0033 BUT LET ME TELL YOU YOUNG MAN HERE HE PUT HIS FACE INTO MINE WITH AN IMPORTANT CONFIDENTIAL AIR SHE'S NOT WORTH IT AND HE CONFIRMED THE ASSERTION BY A SOLEMN NOD
226-131532-0034 WITH A LOOK THAT PLAINLY SAID WHAT THIS TO ME
226-131533-0000 YOU MUST SUPPOSE ABOUT THREE WEEKS PASSED OVER MISSUS GRAHAM AND I WERE NOW ESTABLISHED FRIENDS OR BROTHER AND SISTER AS WE RATHER CHOSE TO CONSIDER OURSELVES
226-131533-0001 SHE CALLED ME GILBERT BY MY EXPRESS DESIRE AND I CALLED HER HELEN FOR I HAD SEEN THAT NAME WRITTEN IN HER BOOKS I SELDOM ATTEMPTED TO SEE HER ABOVE TWICE A WEEK
226-131533-0002 AND STILL I MADE OUR MEETINGS APPEAR THE RESULT OF ACCIDENT AS OFTEN AS I COULD FOR I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL AND ALTOGETHER I BEHAVED WITH SUCH EXCEEDING PROPRIETY THAT SHE NEVER HAD OCCASION TO REPROVE ME ONCE
226-131533-0003 YET I COULD NOT BUT PERCEIVE THAT SHE WAS AT TIMES UNHAPPY AND DISSATISFIED WITH HERSELF OR HER POSITION AND TRULY I MYSELF WAS NOT QUITE CONTENTED WITH THE LATTER THIS ASSUMPTION OF BROTHERLY NONCHALANCE WAS VERY HARD TO SUSTAIN
226-131533-0004 AND I OFTEN FELT MYSELF A MOST CONFOUNDED HYPOCRITE WITH IT ALL I SAW TOO OR RATHER I FELT THAT IN SPITE OF HERSELF I WAS NOT INDIFFERENT TO HER AS THE NOVEL HEROES MODESTLY EXPRESS IT
226-131533-0005 AND WHILE I THANKFULLY ENJOYED MY PRESENT GOOD FORTUNE I COULD NOT FAIL TO WISH AND HOPE FOR SOMETHING BETTER IN FUTURE BUT OF COURSE I KEPT SUCH DREAMS ENTIRELY TO MYSELF
226-131533-0006 YOU'RE GOING TO WILDFELL HALL AREN'T YOU WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SO BECAUSE YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE BUT I WISH YOU WOULDN'T GO SO OFTEN NONSENSE CHILD I DON'T GO ONCE IN SIX WEEKS WHAT DO YOU MEAN
226-131533-0007 WELL BUT IF I WERE YOU I WOULDN'T HAVE SO MUCH TO DO WITH MISSUS GRAHAM WHY ROSE ARE YOU TOO GIVING IN TO THE PREVAILING OPINION NO RETURNED SHE HESITATINGLY
226-131533-0008 BOTH AT THE WILSONS AND THE VICARAGE AND BESIDES MAMMA SAYS IF SHE WERE A PROPER PERSON SHE WOULD NOT BE LIVING THERE BY HERSELF AND DON'T YOU REMEMBER LAST WINTER GILBERT ALL THAT ABOUT THE FALSE NAME TO THE PICTURE
226-131533-0009 AND HOW SHE EXPLAINED IT SAYING SHE HAD FRIENDS OR ACQUAINTANCES FROM WHOM SHE WISHED HER PRESENT RESIDENCE TO BE CONCEALED AND THAT SHE WAS AFRAID OF THEIR TRACING HER OUT AND THEN HOW SUDDENLY SHE STARTED UP AND LEFT THE ROOM WHEN THAT PERSON CAME
226-131533-0010 WHOM SHE TOOK GOOD CARE NOT TO LET US CATCH A GLIMPSE OF AND WHO ARTHUR WITH SUCH AN AIR OF MYSTERY TOLD US WAS HIS MAMMA'S FRIEND YES ROSE I REMEMBER IT ALL AND I CAN FORGIVE YOUR UNCHARITABLE CONCLUSIONS
226-131533-0011 FOR PERHAPS IF I DID NOT KNOW HER MYSELF I SHOULD PUT ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER AND BELIEVE THE SAME AS YOU DO BUT THANK GOD I DO KNOW HER AND I SHOULD BE UNWORTHY THE NAME OF A MAN IF I COULD BELIEVE ANYTHING THAT WAS SAID AGAINST HER
226-131533-0012 UNLESS I HEARD IT FROM HER OWN LIPS I SHOULD AS SOON BELIEVE SUCH THINGS OF YOU ROSE OH GILBERT WELL
226-131533-0013 YOU KNOW NOTHING OF HER FORMER LIFE AND LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT SUCH A PERSON EXISTED NO MATTER THERE IS SUCH A THING AS LOOKING THROUGH A PERSON'S EYES INTO THE HEART AND LEARNING MORE OF THE HEIGHT AND BREADTH
226-131533-0014 AND DEPTH OF ANOTHER'S SOUL IN ONE HOUR THAN IT MIGHT TAKE YOU A LIFETIME TO DISCOVER IF HE OR SHE WERE NOT DISPOSED TO REVEAL IT OR IF YOU HAD NOT THE SENSE TO UNDERSTAND IT THEN YOU ARE GOING TO SEE HER THIS EVENING
226-131533-0015 MISSUS GRAHAM AND I ARE TWO FRIENDS AND WILL BE AND NO MAN BREATHING SHALL HINDER IT OR HAS A RIGHT TO INTERFERE BETWEEN US BUT IF YOU KNEW HOW THEY TALK YOU WOULD BE MORE CAREFUL FOR HER SAKE AS WELL AS FOR YOUR OWN
226-131533-0016 JANE WILSON THINKS YOUR VISITS TO THE OLD HALL BUT ANOTHER PROOF OF HER DEPRAVITY CONFOUND JANE WILSON AND ELIZA MILLWARD IS QUITE GRIEVED ABOUT YOU I HOPE SHE IS
226-131533-0017 BUT I WOULDN'T IF I WERE YOU WOULDN'T WHAT HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT I GO THERE THERE'S NOTHING HID FROM THEM THEY SPY OUT EVERYTHING OH I NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS
226-131533-0018 AND SO THEY DARE TO TURN MY FRIENDSHIP INTO FOOD FOR FURTHER SCANDAL AGAINST HER THAT PROVES THE FALSEHOOD OF THEIR OTHER LIES AT ALL EVENTS IF ANY PROOF WERE WANTING MIND YOU CONTRADICT THEM ROSE WHENEVER YOU CAN
226-131533-0019 BUT THEY DON'T SPEAK OPENLY TO ME ABOUT SUCH THINGS IT IS ONLY BY HINTS AND INNUENDOES AND BY WHAT I HEAR OTHERS SAY THAT I KNEW WHAT THEY THINK WELL THEN I WON'T GO TO DAY AS IT'S GETTING LATISH
226-131533-0020 AFTER HIS CUSTOMARY CHEERFUL AND FATHERLY GREETING OF ROSE WHO WAS RATHER A FAVOURITE WITH THE OLD GENTLEMAN HE TURNED SOMEWHAT STERNLY TO ME WELL SIR SAID HE YOU'RE QUITE A STRANGER IT IS
226-131533-0021 AS HE DEPOSITED HIS PONDEROUS BULK IN THE ARM CHAIR THAT ROSE OFFICIOUSLY BROUGHT TOWARDS HIM IT IS JUST SIX WEEKS BY MY RECKONING SINCE YOU DARKENED MY DOOR HE SPOKE IT WITH EMPHASIS AND STRUCK HIS STICK ON THE FLOOR
226-131533-0022 IS IT SIR SAID I AY IT IS SO HE ADDED AN AFFIRMATORY NOD AND CONTINUED TO GAZE UPON ME WITH A KIND OF IRATE SOLEMNITY HOLDING HIS SUBSTANTIAL STICK BETWEEN HIS KNEES
226-131533-0023 WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED UPON ITS HEAD I HAVE BEEN BUSY I SAID FOR AN APOLOGY WAS EVIDENTLY DEMANDED BUSY REPEATED HE DERISIVELY YES YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN GETTING IN MY HAY
226-131533-0024 IN TIME FOR TEA BUT OFFERED TO HAVE SOME IMMEDIATELY PREPARED IF HE WOULD DO HER THE FAVOUR TO PARTAKE OF IT NOT ANY FOR ME I THANK YOU REPLIED HE I SHALL BE AT HOME IN A FEW MINUTES OH BUT DO STAY AND TAKE A LITTLE
226-131533-0025 IT WILL BE READY IN FIVE MINUTES BUT HE REJECTED THE OFFER WITH A MAJESTIC WAVE OF THE HAND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL TAKE MISSUS MARKHAM SAID HE I'LL TAKE A GLASS OF YOUR EXCELLENT ALE
226-131533-0026 WITH PLEASURE CRIED MY MOTHER PROCEEDING WITH ALACRITY TO PULL THE BELL AND ORDER THE FAVOURED BEVERAGE I THOUGHT CONTINUED HE I'D JUST LOOK IN UPON YOU AS I PASSED AND TASTE YOUR HOME BREWED ALE
226-131533-0027 REALLY EJACULATED MY MOTHER WHY SO MISTER MILLWARD ASKED I HE LOOKED AT ME WITH SOME SEVERITY AND TURNING AGAIN TO MY MOTHER REPEATED
226-131533-0028 AND STRUCK HIS STICK ON THE FLOOR AGAIN MY MOTHER SAT OPPOSITE AN AWE STRUCK BUT ADMIRING AUDITOR MISSUS GRAHAM SAID I HE CONTINUED SHAKING HIS HEAD AS HE SPOKE
226-131533-0029 THESE ARE TERRIBLE REPORTS WHAT SIR SAYS SHE AFFECTING TO BE IGNORANT OF MY MEANING IT IS MY DUTY AS YOUR PASTOR SAID I TO TELL YOU BOTH EVERYTHING THAT I MYSELF SEE REPREHENSIBLE IN YOUR CONDUCT
226-131533-0030 AND ALL I HAVE REASON TO SUSPECT AND WHAT OTHERS TELL ME CONCERNING YOU SO I TOLD HER YOU DID SIR CRIED I STARTING FROM MY SEAT AND STRIKING MY FIST ON THE TABLE
226-131533-0031 BUT SHE OFFERED NO EXTENUATION OR DEFENCE AND WITH A KIND OF SHAMELESS CALMNESS SHOCKING INDEED TO WITNESS IN ONE SO YOUNG AS GOOD AS TOLD ME THAT MY REMONSTRANCE WAS UNAVAILING AND MY PASTORAL ADVICE QUITE THROWN AWAY UPON HER
226-131533-0032 NAY THAT MY VERY PRESENCE WAS DISPLEASING WHILE I SPOKE SUCH THINGS AND I WITHDREW AT LENGTH TOO PLAINLY SEEING THAT NOTHING COULD BE DONE AND SADLY GRIEVED TO FIND HER CASE SO HOPELESS
226-131533-0033 BUT I AM FULLY DETERMINED MISSUS MARKHAM THAT MY DAUGHTERS SHALL NOT CONSORT WITH HER DO YOU ADOPT THE SAME RESOLUTION WITH REGARD TO YOURS AS FOR YOUR SONS AS FOR YOU YOUNG MAN HE CONTINUED STERNLY TURNING TO ME
226-131533-0034 SLAMMING THE DOOR BEHIND ME WITH A BANG THAT SHOOK THE HOUSE TO ITS FOUNDATIONS AND MADE MY MOTHER SCREAM AND GAVE A MOMENTARY RELIEF TO MY EXCITED FEELINGS
226-131533-0035 THE NEXT MINUTE SAW ME HURRYING WITH RAPID STRIDES IN THE DIRECTION OF WILDFELL HALL TO WHAT INTENT OR PURPOSE I COULD SCARCELY TELL BUT I MUST BE MOVING SOMEWHERE AND NO OTHER GOAL WOULD DO
226-131533-0036 I MUST SEE HER TOO AND SPEAK TO HER THAT WAS CERTAIN BUT WHAT TO SAY OR HOW TO ACT I HAD NO DEFINITE IDEA
229-130880-0000 RIGHT OFF I OBSERVED A CLUSTER OF MOUNTAINS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FEET HIGH WHOSE SHAPES WERE VERY WHIMSICALLY SCULPTED AFTER OUR POSITION FIX I REENTERED THE LOUNGE AND WHEN OUR BEARINGS WERE REPORTED ON THE CHART I SAW THAT WE WERE OFF THE ISLAND OF CEYLON
229-130880-0001 THAT PEARL DANGLING FROM THE LOWER LOBE OF THE INDIAN PENINSULA I WENT LOOKING IN THE LIBRARY FOR A BOOK ABOUT THIS ISLAND ONE OF THE MOST FERTILE IN THE WORLD SURE ENOUGH I FOUND A VOLUME ENTITLED CEYLON AND THE SINGHALESE
229-130880-0002 REENTERING THE LOUNGE I FIRST NOTED THE BEARINGS OF CEYLON ON WHICH ANTIQUITY LAVISHED SO MANY DIFFERENT NAMES
229-130880-0003 ITS LENGTH IS TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILES ITS MAXIMUM WIDTH ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES ITS CIRCUMFERENCE NINE HUNDRED MILES ITS SURFACE AREA TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT SQUARE MILES
229-130880-0004 IN OTHER WORDS A LITTLE SMALLER THAN THAT OF IRELAND JUST THEN CAPTAIN NEMO AND HIS CHIEF OFFICER APPEARED THE CAPTAIN GLANCED AT THE CHART THEN TURNING TO ME THE ISLAND OF CEYLON HE SAID
229-130880-0005 IS FAMOUS FOR ITS PEARL FISHERIES WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED PROFESSOR ARONNAX
229-130880-0006 CERTAINLY CAPTAIN FINE IT'S EASILY DONE ONLY WHEN WE SEE THE FISHERIES WE'LL SEE NO FISHERMEN
229-130880-0007 AND WE'LL ARRIVE THERE LATE TONIGHT
229-130880-0008 WHO WENT OUT IMMEDIATELY SOON THE NAUTILUS REENTERED ITS LIQUID ELEMENT AND THE PRESSURE GAUGE INDICATED THAT IT WAS STAYING AT A DEPTH OF THIRTY FEET WITH THE CHART UNDER MY EYES
229-130880-0009 I FOUND IT BY THE NINTH PARALLEL OFF THE NORTHWESTERN SHORES OF CEYLON
229-130880-0010 TO REACH IT WE HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY UP CEYLON'S WEST COAST PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO THEN TOLD ME THERE ARE PEARL FISHERIES IN THE BAY OF BENGAL THE SEAS OF THE EAST INDIES
229-130880-0011 THE SEAS OF CHINA AND JAPAN PLUS THOSE SEAS SOUTH OF THE UNITED STATES THE GULF OF PANAMA AND THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S OFF CEYLON THAT SUCH FISHING REAPS ITS RICHEST REWARDS NO DOUBT WE'LL BE ARRIVING A LITTLE EARLY
229-130880-0012 ONLY DURING THE MONTH OF MARCH AND FOR THIRTY DAYS SOME THREE HUNDRED BOATS CONCENTRATE ON THE LUCRATIVE HARVEST OF THESE TREASURES FROM THE SEA EACH BOAT IS MANNED BY TEN OARSMEN AND TEN FISHERMEN THE LATTER DIVIDE INTO TWO GROUPS
229-130880-0013 DIVE IN ROTATION AND DESCEND TO A DEPTH OF TWELVE METERS WITH THE HELP OF A HEAVY STONE CLUTCHED BETWEEN THEIR FEET AND ATTACHED BY A ROPE TO THEIR BOAT YOU MEAN I SAID
229-130880-0014 THAT SUCH PRIMITIVE METHODS ARE STILL ALL THAT THEY USE ALL
229-130880-0015 ALTHOUGH THESE FISHERIES BELONG TO THE MOST INDUSTRIALIZED PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THE ENGLISH
229-130880-0016 YET IT STRIKES ME THAT DIVING SUITS LIKE YOURS COULD PERFORM YEOMAN SERVICE IN SUCH WORK YES SINCE THOSE POOR FISHERMEN CAN'T STAY LONG UNDERWATER ON HIS VOYAGE TO CEYLON
229-130880-0017 THE ENGLISHMAN PERCIVAL MADE MUCH OF A KAFFIR WHO STAYED UNDER FIVE MINUTES WITHOUT COMING UP TO THE SURFACE BUT I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE
229-130880-0018 I KNOW THAT SOME DIVERS CAN LAST UP TO FIFTY SEVEN SECONDS AND HIGHLY SKILLFUL ONES TO EIGHTY SEVEN BUT SUCH MEN ARE RARE
229-130880-0019 I BELIEVE THE AVERAGE TIME UNDERWATER THAT THESE FISHERMEN CAN TOLERATE IS THIRTY SECONDS DURING WHICH THEY HASTILY STUFF THEIR LITTLE NETS WITH ALL THE PEARL OYSTERS THEY CAN TEAR LOOSE
229-130880-0020 THEIR VISION WEAKENS ULCERS BREAK OUT ON THEIR EYES SORES FORM ON THEIR BODIES AND SOME ARE EVEN STRICKEN WITH APOPLEXY ON THE OCEAN FLOOR YES I SAID IT'S A SAD OCCUPATION
229-130880-0021 AND ONE THAT EXISTS ONLY TO GRATIFY THE WHIMS OF FASHION BUT TELL ME CAPTAIN HOW MANY OYSTERS CAN A BOAT FISH UP IN A WORKDAY
229-130880-0022 IT'S EVEN SAID THAT IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN WHEN THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT WENT FISHING ON ITS OWN BEHALF ITS DIVERS WORKED JUST TWENTY DAYS AND BROUGHT UP SEVENTY SIX MILLION OYSTERS
229-130880-0023 THE FISHERMEN ARE WELL PAID AREN'T THEY HARDLY PROFESSOR IN PANAMA THEY MAKE JUST ONE DOLLAR PER WEEK IN MOST PLACES THEY EARN ONLY A PENNY FOR EACH OYSTER THAT HAS A PEARL AND THEY BRING UP SO MANY THAT HAVE NONE
229-130880-0024 ONLY ONE PENNY TO THOSE POOR PEOPLE WHO MAKE THEIR EMPLOYERS RICH THAT'S ATROCIOUS ON THAT NOTE PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO TOLD ME
229-130880-0025 AND IF BY CHANCE SOME EAGER FISHERMAN ARRIVES EARLY WELL WE CAN WATCH HIM AT WORK THAT SUITS ME CAPTAIN BY THE WAY PROFESSOR ARONNAX YOU AREN'T AFRAID OF SHARKS ARE YOU SHARKS I EXCLAIMED
229-130880-0026 THIS STRUCK ME AS A PRETTY NEEDLESS QUESTION TO SAY THE LEAST WELL CAPTAIN NEMO WENT ON I ADMIT CAPTAIN I'M NOT YET ON VERY FAMILIAR TERMS WITH THAT GENUS OF FISH WE'RE USED TO THEM
229-130880-0027 THE REST OF US CAPTAIN NEMO ANSWERED AND IN TIME YOU WILL BE TOO ANYHOW WE'LL BE ARMED AND ON OUR WAY WE MIGHT HUNT A MAN EATER OR TWO IT'S A FASCINATING SPORT SO PROFESSOR I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW
229-130880-0028 BRIGHT AND EARLY THIS SAID IN A CAREFREE TONE CAPTAIN NEMO LEFT THE LOUNGE IF YOU'RE INVITED TO HUNT BEARS IN THE SWISS MOUNTAINS YOU MIGHT SAY OH GOOD I GET TO GO BEAR HUNTING TOMORROW
229-130880-0029 IF YOU'RE INVITED TO HUNT LIONS ON THE ATLAS PLAINS OR TIGERS IN THE JUNGLES OF INDIA YOU MIGHT SAY HA NOW'S MY CHANCE TO HUNT LIONS AND TIGERS BUT IF YOU'RE INVITED TO HUNT SHARKS IN THEIR NATIVE ELEMENT
229-130880-0030 YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK IT OVER BEFORE ACCEPTING AS FOR ME I PASSED A HAND OVER MY BROW WHERE BEADS OF COLD SWEAT WERE BUSY FORMING LET'S THINK THIS OVER I SAID TO MYSELF AND LET'S TAKE OUR TIME
229-130880-0031 HUNTING OTTERS IN UNDERWATER FORESTS AS WE DID IN THE FORESTS OF CRESPO ISLAND IS AN ACCEPTABLE ACTIVITY
229-130880-0032 THAT'S ANOTHER STORY I KNOW THAT IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES PARTICULARLY THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS NEGROES DON'T HESITATE TO ATTACK SHARKS DAGGER IN ONE HAND AND NOOSE IN THE OTHER
229-130880-0033 BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT MANY WHO FACE THOSE FEARSOME ANIMALS DON'T COME BACK ALIVE BESIDES I'M NOT A NEGRO AND EVEN IF I WERE A NEGRO IN THIS INSTANCE I DON'T THINK A LITTLE HESITATION ON MY PART WOULD BE OUT OF PLACE
229-130880-0034 AND THERE I WAS FANTASIZING ABOUT SHARKS ENVISIONING HUGE JAWS ARMED WITH MULTIPLE ROWS OF TEETH AND CAPABLE OF CUTTING A MAN IN HALF I COULD ALREADY FEEL A DEFINITE PAIN AROUND MY PELVIC GIRDLE
229-130880-0035 AND HOW I RESENTED THE OFFHAND MANNER IN WHICH THE CAPTAIN HAD EXTENDED HIS DEPLORABLE INVITATION
229-130880-0036 THANK HEAVENS I SAID TO MYSELF CONSEIL WILL NEVER WANT TO COME ALONG AND THAT'LL BE MY EXCUSE FOR NOT GOING WITH THE CAPTAIN AS FOR NED LAND I ADMIT I FELT LESS CONFIDENT OF HIS WISDOM
229-130880-0037 DANGER HOWEVER GREAT HELD A PERENNIAL ATTRACTION FOR HIS AGGRESSIVE NATURE I WENT BACK TO READING SIRR'S BOOK BUT I LEAFED THROUGH IT MECHANICALLY BETWEEN THE LINES I KEPT SEEING FEARSOME WIDE OPEN JAWS
229-130880-0038 JUST THEN CONSEIL AND THE CANADIAN ENTERED WITH A CALM EVEN GLEEFUL AIR LITTLE DID THEY KNOW WHAT WAS WAITING FOR THEM YE GODS SIR NED LAND TOLD ME YOUR CAPTAIN NEMO THE DEVIL TAKE HIM
229-130880-0039 HAS JUST MADE US A VERY PLEASANT PROPOSITION OH I SAID YOU KNOW ABOUT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MASTER CONSEIL REPLIED THE NAUTILUS'S COMMANDER HAS INVITED US TOGETHER WITH MASTER
229-130880-0040 FOR A VISIT TOMORROW TO CEYLON'S MAGNIFICENT PEARL FISHERIES HE DID SO IN THE MOST CORDIAL TERMS AND CONDUCTED HIMSELF LIKE A TRUE GENTLEMAN HE DIDN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING ELSE NOTHING SIR THE CANADIAN REPLIED
229-130880-0041 HE SAID YOU'D ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS LITTLE STROLL INDEED I SAID BUT DIDN'T HE GIVE YOU ANY DETAILS ON NOT A ONE MISTER NATURALIST YOU WILL BE GOING WITH US RIGHT ME
229-130880-0042 WHY YES CERTAINLY OF COURSE I CAN SEE THAT YOU LIKE THE IDEA MISTER LAND YES IT WILL BE A REALLY UNUSUAL EXPERIENCE AND POSSIBLY DANGEROUS I ADDED IN AN INSINUATING TONE
229-130880-0043 DANGEROUS NED LAND REPLIED A SIMPLE TRIP TO AN OYSTERBANK ASSUREDLY
229-130880-0044 FOR MY PART I STARED AT THEM WITH ANXIOUS EYES AS IF THEY WERE ALREADY MISSING A LIMB OR TWO SHOULD I ALERT THEM YES SURELY BUT I HARDLY KNEW HOW TO GO ABOUT IT WOULD MASTER
229-130880-0045 CONSEIL SAID TO ME GIVE US SOME BACKGROUND ON PEARL FISHING ON THE FISHING ITSELF I ASKED OR ON THE OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS THAT ON THE FISHING THE CANADIAN REPLIED BEFORE WE TACKLE THE TERRAIN IT HELPS TO BE FAMILIAR WITH IT
229-130880-0046 ALL RIGHT SIT DOWN MY FRIENDS
229-130880-0047 NED AND CONSEIL TOOK SEATS ON A COUCH AND RIGHT OFF THE CANADIAN SAID TO ME SIR JUST WHAT IS A PEARL EXACTLY MY GALLANT NED I REPLIED FOR POETS A PEARL IS A TEAR FROM THE SEA
229-130880-0048 FOR ORIENTALS IT'S A DROP OF SOLIDIFIED DEW FOR THE LADIES IT'S A JEWEL
229-130880-0049 NECKS AND EARS THAT'S OBLONG IN SHAPE GLASSY IN LUSTER AND FORMED FROM MOTHER OF PEARL FOR CHEMISTS IT'S A MIXTURE OF CALCIUM PHOSPHATE AND CALCIUM CARBONATE WITH A LITTLE GELATIN PROTEIN
229-130880-0050 AND FINALLY FOR NATURALISTS IT'S A SIMPLE FESTERING SECRETION FROM THE ORGAN THAT PRODUCES MOTHER OF PEARL IN CERTAIN BIVALVES BRANCH MOLLUSCA CONSEIL SAID CLASS
229-130880-0051 ACEPHALA ORDER TESTACEA CORRECT MY SCHOLARLY CONSEIL NOW THEN THOSE TESTACEA CAPABLE OF PRODUCING PEARLS INCLUDE RAINBOW ABALONE
229-130880-0052 TURBO SNAILS GIANT CLAMS AND SALTWATER SCALLOPS BRIEFLY ALL THOSE THAT SECRETE MOTHER OF PEARL IN OTHER WORDS THAT BLUE AZURE VIOLET OR WHITE SUBSTANCE
229-130880-0053 LINING THE INSIDES OF THEIR VALVES ARE MUSSELS INCLUDED TOO THE CANADIAN ASKED YES THE MUSSELS OF CERTAIN STREAMS IN SCOTLAND WALES IRELAND SAXONY BOHEMIA AND FRANCE
229-130880-0054 GOOD THE CANADIAN REPLIED FROM NOW ON WE'LL PAY CLOSER ATTENTION TO EM BUT I WENT ON FOR SECRETING PEARLS THE IDEAL MOLLUSK IS THE PEARL OYSTER MELEAGRINA MARGARITIFERA
229-130880-0055 THAT VALUABLE SHELLFISH PEARLS RESULT SIMPLY FROM MOTHER OF PEARL SOLIDIFYING INTO A GLOBULAR SHAPE EITHER THEY STICK TO THE OYSTER'S SHELL OR THEY BECOME EMBEDDED IN THE CREATURE'S FOLDS
229-130880-0056 ON THE VALVES A PEARL STICKS FAST ON THE FLESH IT LIES LOOSE BUT ITS NUCLEUS IS ALWAYS SOME SMALL HARD OBJECT SAY A STERILE EGG OR A GRAIN OF SAND
229-130880-0057 AROUND WHICH THE MOTHER OF PEARL IS DEPOSITED IN THIN CONCENTRIC LAYERS OVER SEVERAL YEARS IN SUCCESSION CAN ONE FIND SEVERAL PEARLS IN THE SAME OYSTER CONSEIL ASKED YES MY BOY
229-130880-0058 THEY EVEN MENTION ONE OYSTER ABOUT WHICH I REMAIN DUBIOUS
229-130880-0059 NED LAND YELPED DID I SAY SHARKS I EXCLAIMED HASTILY I MEANT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PEARLS SHARKS WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE INDEED CONSEIL SAID
229-130880-0060 BUT WILL MASTER NOW TELL US HOW ONE GOES ABOUT EXTRACTING THESE PEARLS ONE PROCEEDS IN SEVERAL WAYS AND OFTEN WHEN PEARLS STICK TO THE VALVES FISHERMEN EVEN PULL THEM LOOSE WITH PLIERS
229-130880-0061 THUS THEY DIE IN THE OPEN AIR AND BY THE END OF TEN DAYS THEY'VE ROTTED SUFFICIENTLY NEXT THEY'RE IMMERSED IN HUGE TANKS OF SALT WATER THEN THEY'RE OPENED UP AND WASHED AT THIS POINT THE SORTERS BEGIN THEIR TWOFOLD TASK
229-130880-0062 FIRST THEY REMOVE THE LAYERS OF MOTHER OF PEARL WHICH ARE KNOWN IN THE INDUSTRY BY THE NAMES LEGITIMATE SILVER BASTARD WHITE OR BASTARD BLACK
229-130880-0063 THEN THEY REMOVE THE OYSTER'S MEATY TISSUE BOIL IT AND FINALLY STRAIN IT IN ORDER TO EXTRACT EVEN THE SMALLEST PEARLS DO THE PRICES OF THESE PEARLS DIFFER DEPENDING ON THEIR SIZE CONSEIL ASKED NOT ONLY ON THEIR SIZE I REPLIED
229-130880-0064 BUT ALSO ACCORDING TO THEIR SHAPE THEIR WATER IN OTHER WORDS THEIR COLOR AND THEIR ORIENT IN OTHER WORDS THAT DAPPLED SHIMMERING GLOW THAT MAKES THEM SO DELIGHTFUL TO THE EYE THE FINEST PEARLS ARE CALLED VIRGIN PEARLS OR PARAGONS
229-130880-0065 THEY FORM IN ISOLATION WITHIN THE MOLLUSK'S TISSUE THEY'RE WHITE OFTEN OPAQUE BUT SOMETIMES OF OPALESCENT TRANSPARENCY AND USUALLY SPHERICAL OR PEAR SHAPED THE SPHERICAL ONES ARE MADE INTO BRACELETS
229-130880-0066 THE PEAR SHAPED ONES INTO EARRINGS AND SINCE THEY'RE THE MOST VALUABLE THEY'RE PRICED INDIVIDUALLY THE OTHER PEARLS THAT STICK TO THE OYSTER'S SHELL ARE MORE ERRATICALLY SHAPED AND ARE PRICED BY WEIGHT FINALLY CLASSED IN THE LOWEST ORDER
229-130880-0067 THE SMALLEST PEARLS ARE KNOWN BY THE NAME SEED PEARLS THEY'RE PRICED BY THE MEASURING CUP AND ARE USED MAINLY IN THE CREATION OF EMBROIDERY FOR CHURCH VESTMENTS BUT IT MUST BE A LONG HARD JOB SORTING OUT THESE PEARLS BY SIZE
229-130880-0068 THE CANADIAN SAID NO MY FRIEND THAT TASK IS PERFORMED WITH ELEVEN STRAINERS OR SIEVES THAT ARE PIERCED WITH DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF HOLES THOSE PEARLS STAYING IN THE STRAINERS WITH TWENTY TO EIGHTY HOLES ARE IN THE FIRST ORDER
229-130880-0069 THOSE NOT SLIPPING THROUGH THE SIEVES PIERCED WITH ONE HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED HOLES ARE IN THE SECOND ORDER FINALLY THOSE PEARLS FOR WHICH ONE USES STRAINERS PIERCED WITH NINE HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND HOLES MAKE UP THE SEED PEARLS
229-130880-0070 HOW INGENIOUS CONSEIL SAID TO REDUCE DIVIDING AND CLASSIFYING PEARLS TO A MECHANICAL OPERATION AND COULD MASTER TELL US THE PROFITS BROUGHT IN BY HARVESTING THESE BANKS OF PEARL OYSTERS ACCORDING TO SIRR'S BOOK I REPLIED
229-130880-0071 THESE CEYLON FISHERIES ARE FARMED ANNUALLY FOR A TOTAL PROFIT OF THREE MILLION MAN EATERS FRANCS CONSEIL REBUKED YES FRANCS THREE MILLION FRANCS I WENT ON
229-130880-0072 BUT I DON'T THINK THESE FISHERIES BRING IN THE RETURNS THEY ONCE DID SIMILARLY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN FISHERIES
229-130880-0073 BUT NOW THEY BRING IN ONLY TWO THIRDS OF THAT AMOUNT ALL IN ALL IT'S ESTIMATED THAT NINE MILLION FRANCS IS THE CURRENT YEARLY RETURN FOR THE WHOLE PEARL HARVESTING INDUSTRY BUT CONSEIL ASKED
229-130880-0074 HAVEN'T CERTAIN FAMOUS PEARLS BEEN QUOTED AT EXTREMELY HIGH PRICES YES MY BOY
229-130880-0075 I'VE EVEN HEARD STORIES THE CANADIAN SAID ABOUT SOME LADY IN ANCIENT TIMES WHO DRANK PEARLS IN VINEGAR CLEOPATRA CONSEIL SHOT BACK IT MUST HAVE TASTED PRETTY BAD NED LAND ADDED ABOMINABLE NED MY FRIEND
229-130880-0076 CONSEIL REPLIED BUT WHEN A LITTLE GLASS OF VINEGAR IS WORTH ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS ITS TASTE IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY
229-130880-0077 NED LAND MARRIED TO CLEOPATRA CONSEIL EXCLAIMED BUT I WAS ALL SET TO TIE THE KNOT CONSEIL THE CANADIAN REPLIED IN ALL SERIOUSNESS
229-130880-0078 I EVEN BOUGHT A PEARL NECKLACE FOR MY FIANCEE KATE TENDER BUT SHE MARRIED SOMEBODY ELSE INSTEAD
229-130880-0079 BUT YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY TRUST ME ON THIS PROFESSOR ITS PEARLS WERE SO BIG
229-130880-0080 MY GALLANT NED I REPLIED LAUGHING THOSE WERE ARTIFICIAL PEARLS ORDINARY GLASS BEADS WHOSE INSIDES WERE COATED WITH ESSENCE OF ORIENT WOW
229-130880-0081 THAT ESSENCE OF ORIENT MUST SELL FOR QUITE A LARGE SUM AS LITTLE AS ZERO IT COMES FROM THE SCALES OF A EUROPEAN CARP IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN A SILVER SUBSTANCE THAT COLLECTS IN THE WATER AND IS PRESERVED IN AMMONIA IT'S WORTHLESS
229-130880-0082 MAYBE THAT'S WHY KATE TENDER MARRIED SOMEBODY ELSE REPLIED MISTER LAND PHILOSOPHICALLY BUT I SAID GETTING BACK TO PEARLS OF GREAT VALUE I DON'T THINK ANY SOVEREIGN EVER POSSESSED ONE SUPERIOR TO THE PEARL OWNED BY CAPTAIN NEMO
229-130880-0083 THIS ONE CONSEIL SAID POINTING TO A MAGNIFICENT JEWEL IN ITS GLASS CASE EXACTLY AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT FAR OFF WHEN I ESTIMATE ITS VALUE AT TWO MILLION UH FRANCS
229-130880-0084 CONSEIL SAID QUICKLY YES I SAID TWO MILLION FRANCS AND NO DOUBT ALL IT COST OUR CAPTAIN WAS THE EFFORT TO PICK IT UP HA NED LAND EXCLAIMED DURING OUR STROLL TOMORROW WHO SAYS WE WON'T RUN INTO ONE JUST LIKE IT
229-130880-0085 CONSEIL PUT IN AND WHY NOT WHAT GOOD WOULD A PEARL WORTH MILLIONS DO US HERE ON THE NAUTILUS HERE NO NED LAND SAID BUT ELSEWHERE OH ELSEWHERE CONSEIL PUT IN
229-130880-0086 SHAKING HIS HEAD IN FACT I SAID MISTER LAND IS RIGHT AND IF WE EVER BROUGHT BACK TO EUROPE OR AMERICA A PEARL WORTH MILLIONS IT WOULD MAKE THE STORY OF OUR ADVENTURES MORE AUTHENTIC AND MUCH MORE REWARDING THAT'S HOW I SEE IT
229-130880-0087 THE CANADIAN SAID BUT SAID CONSEIL WHO PERPETUALLY RETURNED TO THE DIDACTIC SIDE OF THINGS IS THIS PEARL FISHING EVER DANGEROUS NO I REPLIED QUICKLY ESPECIALLY IF ONE TAKES CERTAIN PRECAUTIONS
229-130880-0088 WHAT RISKS WOULD YOU RUN IN A JOB LIKE THAT NED LAND SAID SWALLOWING A FEW GULPS OF SALT WATER WHATEVER YOU SAY NED THEN TRYING TO IMITATE CAPTAIN NEMO'S CAREFREE TONE I ASKED
229-130880-0089 BY THE WAY GALLANT NED ARE YOU AFRAID OF SHARKS

233-134440-0000 IF YOU HAVE LIVED IN CITIES AND HAVE WALKED IN THE PARK ON A SUMMER AFTERNOON YOU HAVE PERHAPS SEEN BLINKING IN A CORNER OF HIS IRON CAGE
233-134440-0001 A HUGE GROTESQUE KIND OF MONKEY A CREATURE WITH UGLY SAGGING HAIRLESS SKIN BELOW HIS EYES AND A BRIGHT PURPLE UNDERBODY THIS MONKEY IS A TRUE MONSTER
233-134440-0002 IN THE COMPLETENESS OF HIS UGLINESS HE ACHIEVED A KIND OF PERVERTED BEAUTY CHILDREN STOPPING BEFORE THE CAGE ARE FASCINATED MEN TURN AWAY WITH AN AIR OF DISGUST AND WOMEN LINGER FOR A MOMENT
233-134440-0003 TRYING PERHAPS TO REMEMBER WHICH ONE OF THEIR MALE ACQUAINTANCES THE THING IN SOME FAINT WAY RESEMBLES HAD YOU BEEN IN THE EARLIER YEARS OF YOUR LIFE A CITIZEN OF THE VILLAGE OF WINESBURG OHIO
233-134440-0004 THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR YOU NO MYSTERY IN REGARD TO THE BEAST IN HIS CAGE IT IS LIKE WASH WILLIAMS YOU WOULD HAVE SAID AS HE SITS IN THE CORNER THERE THE BEAST IS EXACTLY LIKE OLD WASH
233-134440-0005 SITTING ON THE GRASS IN THE STATION YARD ON A SUMMER EVENING AFTER HE HAS CLOSED HIS OFFICE FOR THE NIGHT WASH WILLIAMS THE TELEGRAPH OPERATOR OF WINESBURG WAS THE UGLIEST THING IN TOWN HIS GIRTH WAS IMMENSE
233-134440-0006 HIS NECK THIN HIS LEGS FEEBLE HE WAS DIRTY EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM WAS UNCLEAN EVEN THE WHITES OF HIS EYES LOOKED SOILED I GO TOO FAST NOT EVERYTHING ABOUT WASH WAS UNCLEAN
233-134440-0007 HE TOOK CARE OF HIS HANDS HIS FINGERS WERE FAT BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND SHAPELY IN THE HAND THAT LAY ON THE TABLE BY THE INSTRUMENT IN THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE IN HIS YOUTH
233-134440-0008 WASH WILLIAMS HAD BEEN CALLED THE BEST TELEGRAPH OPERATOR IN THE STATE AND IN SPITE OF HIS DEGRADEMENT TO THE OBSCURE OFFICE AT WINESBURG HE WAS STILL PROUD OF HIS ABILITY
233-134440-0009 WASH WILLIAMS DID NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THE MEN OF THE TOWN IN WHICH HE LIVED I'LL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM HE SAID LOOKING WITH BLEARY EYES AT THE MEN WHO WALKED ALONG THE STATION PLATFORM
233-134440-0010 PAST THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE UP ALONG MAIN STREET HE WENT IN THE EVENING TO ED GRIFFITH'S SALOON AND AFTER DRINKING UNBELIEVABLE QUANTITIES OF BEER STAGGERED OFF TO HIS ROOM IN THE NEW WILLARD HOUSE AND TO HIS BED FOR THE NIGHT
233-134440-0011 WASH WILLIAMS WAS A MAN OF COURAGE A THING HAD HAPPENED TO HIM THAT MADE HIM HATE LIFE AND HE HATED IT WHOLEHEARTEDLY WITH THE ABANDON OF A POET FIRST OF ALL HE HATED WOMEN
233-134440-0012 BITCHES HE CALLED THEM HIS FEELING TOWARD MEN WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT HE PITIED THEM DOES NOT EVERY MAN LET HIS LIFE BE MANAGED FOR HIM BY SOME BITCH OR ANOTHER HE ASKED
233-134440-0013 IN WINESBURG NO ATTENTION WAS PAID TO WASH WILLIAMS AND HIS HATRED OF HIS FELLOWS ONCE MISSUS WHITE THE BANKER'S WIFE COMPLAINED TO THE TELEGRAPH COMPANY
233-134440-0014 AND SMELLED ABOMINABLY BUT NOTHING CAME OF HER COMPLAINT HERE AND THERE A MAN RESPECTED THE OPERATOR INSTINCTIVELY THE MAN FELT IN HIM A GLOWING RESENTMENT OF SOMETHING HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO RESENT
233-134440-0015 WHEN WASH WALKED THROUGH THE STREETS SUCH A ONE HAD AN INSTINCT TO PAY HIM HOMAGE TO RAISE HIS HAT OR TO BOW BEFORE HIM THE SUPERINTENDENT WHO HAD SUPERVISION OVER THE TELEGRAPH OPERATORS
233-134440-0016 ON THE RAILROAD THAT WENT THROUGH WINESBURG FELT THAT WAY HE HAD PUT WASH INTO THE OBSCURE OFFICE AT WINESBURG TO AVOID DISCHARGING HIM AND HE MEANT TO KEEP HIM THERE WHEN HE RECEIVED THE LETTER OF COMPLAINT FROM THE BANKER'S WIFE
233-134440-0017 HE TORE IT UP AND LAUGHED UNPLEASANTLY FOR SOME REASON HE THOUGHT OF HIS OWN WIFE AS HE TORE UP THE LETTER WASH WILLIAMS ONCE HAD A WIFE WHEN HE WAS STILL A YOUNG MAN HE MARRIED A WOMAN AT DAYTON OHIO
233-134440-0018 THE WOMAN WAS TALL AND SLENDER AND HAD BLUE EYES AND YELLOW HAIR WASH WAS HIMSELF A COMELY YOUTH HE LOVED THE WOMAN WITH A LOVE AS ABSORBING AS THE HATRED HE LATER FELT FOR ALL WOMEN
233-134440-0019 IN ALL OF WINESBURG THERE WAS BUT ONE PERSON WHO KNEW THE STORY OF THE THING THAT HAD MADE UGLY THE PERSON AND THE CHARACTER OF WASH WILLIAMS
233-134440-0020 HE ONCE TOLD THE STORY TO GEORGE WILLARD AND THE TELLING OF THE TALE CAME ABOUT IN THIS WAY GEORGE WILLARD WENT ONE EVENING TO WALK WITH BELLE CARPENTER A TRIMMER OF WOMEN'S HATS
233-134440-0021 WHO WORKED IN A MILLINERY SHOP KEPT BY MISSUS KATE MC HUGH THE YOUNG MAN WAS NOT IN LOVE WITH THE WOMAN
233-134440-0022 IN ED GRIFFITH'S SALOON BUT AS THEY WALKED ABOUT UNDER THE TREES THEY OCCASIONALLY EMBRACED THE NIGHT AND THEIR OWN THOUGHTS HAD AROUSED SOMETHING IN THEM AS THEY WERE RETURNING TO MAIN STREET THEY PASSED THE LITTLE LAWN
233-134440-0023 BESIDE THE RAILROAD STATION AND SAW WASH WILLIAMS APPARENTLY ASLEEP ON THE GRASS BENEATH A TREE ON THE NEXT EVENING THE OPERATOR AND GEORGE WILLARD WALKED OUT TOGETHER DOWN THE RAILROAD THEY WENT
233-134440-0024 AND SAT ON A PILE OF DECAYING RAILROAD TIES BESIDE THE TRACKS IT WAS THEN THAT THE OPERATOR TOLD THE YOUNG REPORTER HIS STORY OF HATE PERHAPS A DOZEN TIMES
233-134440-0025 GEORGE WILLARD AND THE STRANGE SHAPELESS MAN WHO LIVED AT HIS FATHER'S HOTEL HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF TALKING THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED AT THE HIDEOUS LEERING FACE
233-134440-0026 SOMETHING HE SAW LURKING IN THE STARING EYES TOLD HIM THAT THE MAN WHO HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO OTHERS HAD NEVERTHELESS SOMETHING TO SAY TO HIM
233-134440-0027 HE WAITED EXPECTANTLY WHEN THE OPERATOR REMAINED SILENT AND SEEMED TO HAVE CHANGED HIS MIND ABOUT TALKING HE TRIED TO MAKE CONVERSATION WERE YOU EVER MARRIED MISTER WILLIAMS HE BEGAN
233-134440-0028 I SUPPOSE YOU WERE AND YOUR WIFE IS DEAD IS THAT IT WASH WILLIAMS SPAT FORTH A SUCCESSION OF VILE OATHS YES SHE IS DEAD HE AGREED SHE IS DEAD AS ALL WOMEN ARE DEAD
233-134440-0029 SHE IS A LIVING DEAD THING WALKING IN THE SIGHT OF MEN AND MAKING THE EARTH FOUL BY HER PRESENCE STARING INTO THE BOY'S EYES THE MAN BECAME PURPLE WITH RAGE DON'T HAVE FOOL NOTIONS IN YOUR HEAD
233-134440-0030 HE COMMANDED MY WIFE SHE IS DEAD YES SURELY I TELL YOU ALL WOMEN ARE DEAD MY MOTHER YOUR MOTHER
233-134440-0031 AND WITH WHOM I SAW YOU WALKING ABOUT YESTERDAY ALL OF THEM THEY ARE ALL DEAD I TELL YOU THERE IS SOMETHING ROTTEN ABOUT THEM I WAS MARRIED SURE MY WIFE WAS DEAD BEFORE SHE MARRIED ME
233-134440-0032 SHE WAS A FOUL THING COME OUT A WOMAN MORE FOUL SHE WAS A THING SENT TO MAKE LIFE UNBEARABLE TO ME I WAS A FOOL DO YOU SEE AS YOU ARE NOW AND SO I MARRIED THIS WOMAN
233-134440-0033 I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MEN A LITTLE BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND WOMEN THEY ARE SENT TO PREVENT MEN MAKING THE WORLD WORTH WHILE IT IS A TRICK IN NATURE UGH THEY ARE CREEPING CRAWLING SQUIRMING THINGS
233-134440-0034 THEY WITH THEIR SOFT HANDS AND THEIR BLUE EYES THE SIGHT OF A WOMAN SICKENS ME WHY I DON'T KILL EVERY WOMAN I SEE I DON'T KNOW
233-134440-0035 HALF FRIGHTENED AND YET FASCINATED BY THE LIGHT BURNING IN THE EYES OF THE HIDEOUS OLD MAN GEORGE WILLARD LISTENED AFIRE WITH CURIOSITY DARKNESS CAME ON AND HE LEANED FORWARD
233-134440-0036 WHEN IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS HE COULD NO LONGER SEE THE PURPLE BLOATED FACE AND THE BURNING EYES A CURIOUS FANCY CAME TO HIM WASH WILLIAMS TALKED IN LOW EVEN TONES
233-134440-0037 THAT MADE HIS WORDS SEEM THE MORE TERRIBLE IN THE DARKNESS THE YOUNG REPORTER FOUND HIMSELF IMAGINING THAT HE SAT ON THE RAILROAD TIES BESIDE A COMELY YOUNG MAN WITH BLACK HAIR AND BLACK SHINING EYES
233-134440-0038 THERE WAS SOMETHING ALMOST BEAUTIFUL IN THE VOICE OF WASH WILLIAMS THE HIDEOUS TELLING HIS STORY OF HATE THE TELEGRAPH OPERATOR OF WINESBURG SITTING IN THE DARKNESS ON THE RAILROAD TIES HAD BECOME A POET
233-134440-0039 HATRED HAD RAISED HIM TO THAT ELEVATION IT IS BECAUSE I SAW YOU KISSING THE LIPS OF THAT BELLE CARPENTER THAT I TELL YOU MY STORY HE SAID WHAT HAPPENED TO ME MAY NEXT HAPPEN TO YOU
233-134440-0040 ALREADY YOU MAY BE HAVING DREAMS IN YOUR HEAD
233-134440-0041 WASH WILLIAMS BEGAN TELLING THE STORY OF HIS MARRIED LIFE WITH THE TALL BLONDE GIRL WITH THE BLUE EYES WHOM HE HAD MET WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG OPERATOR AT DAYTON OHIO HERE AND THERE HIS STORY WAS TOUCHED WITH MOMENTS OF BEAUTY
233-134440-0042 INTERMINGLED WITH STRINGS OF VILE CURSES THE OPERATOR HAD MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF A DENTIST WHO WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THREE SISTERS ON HIS MARRIAGE DAY BECAUSE OF HIS ABILITY HE WAS PROMOTED TO A POSITION AS DISPATCHER
233-134440-0043 AT AN INCREASED SALARY AND SENT TO AN OFFICE AT COLUMBUS OHIO THERE HE SETTLED DOWN WITH HIS YOUNG WIFE AND BEGAN BUYING A HOUSE ON THE INSTALLMENT PLAN THE YOUNG TELEGRAPH OPERATOR WAS MADLY IN LOVE
233-134440-0044 WITH A KIND OF RELIGIOUS FERVOR HE HAD MANAGED TO GO THROUGH THE PITFALLS OF HIS YOUTH AND TO REMAIN VIRGINAL UNTIL AFTER HIS MARRIAGE HE MADE FOR GEORGE WILLARD A PICTURE OF HIS LIFE IN THE HOUSE AT COLUMBUS OHIO WITH THE YOUNG WIFE
233-134440-0045 IN THE GARDEN BACK OF OUR HOUSE WE PLANTED VEGETABLES HE SAID YOU KNOW PEAS AND CORN AND SUCH THINGS WE WENT TO COLUMBUS IN EARLY MARCH AND AS SOON AS THE DAYS BECAME WARM I WENT TO WORK IN THE GARDEN
233-134440-0046 WITH A SPADE I TURNED UP THE BLACK GROUND WHILE SHE RAN ABOUT
233-134440-0047 LATE IN APRIL CAME THE PLANTING IN THE LITTLE PATHS AMONG THE SEED BEDS SHE STOOD HOLDING A PAPER BAG IN HER HAND THE BAG WAS FILLED WITH SEEDS A FEW AT A TIME SHE HANDED ME THE SEEDS
233-134440-0048 FOR A MOMENT THERE WAS A CATCH IN THE VOICE OF THE MAN TALKING IN THE DARKNESS I LOVED HER HE SAID I DON'T CLAIM NOT TO BE A FOOL I LOVE HER YET THERE IN THE DUSK IN THE SPRING EVENING
233-134440-0049 I KISSED HER SHOES AND THE ANKLES ABOVE HER SHOES WHEN THE HEM OF HER GARMENT TOUCHED MY FACE I TREMBLED WHEN AFTER TWO YEARS OF THAT LIFE
233-134440-0050 OR HER I JUST SENT HER HOME TO HER MOTHER AND SAID NOTHING THERE WAS NOTHING TO SAY I HAD FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THE BANK AND I GAVE HER THAT I DIDN'T ASK HER REASONS
233-134440-0051 I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING WHEN SHE HAD GONE I CRIED LIKE A SILLY BOY PRETTY SOON I HAD A CHANCE TO SELL THE HOUSE AND I SENT THAT MONEY TO HER WASH WILLIAMS AND GEORGE WILLARD
233-134440-0052 AROSE FROM THE PILE OF RAILROAD TIES AND WALKED ALONG THE TRACKS TOWARD TOWN THE OPERATOR FINISHED HIS TALE QUICKLY BREATHLESSLY HER MOTHER SENT FOR ME HE SAID
233-134440-0053 SHE WROTE ME A LETTER AND ASKED ME TO COME TO THEIR HOUSE AT DAYTON WHEN I GOT THERE IT WAS EVENING ABOUT THIS TIME WASH WILLIAMS VOICE ROSE TO A HALF SCREAM
233-134440-0054 I SAT IN THE PARLOR OF THAT HOUSE TWO HOURS HER MOTHER TOOK ME IN THERE AND LEFT ME THEIR HOUSE WAS STYLISH THEY WERE WHAT IS CALLED RESPECTABLE PEOPLE THERE WERE PLUSH CHAIRS AND A COUCH IN THE ROOM
233-134440-0055 I WAS TREMBLING ALL OVER I HATED THE MEN I THOUGHT HAD WRONGED HER I WAS SICK OF LIVING ALONE AND WANTED HER BACK THE LONGER I WAITED THE MORE RAW AND TENDER I BECAME I THOUGHT THAT IF SHE CAME IN AND JUST
233-134440-0056 TOUCHED ME WITH HER HAND I WOULD PERHAPS FAINT AWAY I ACHED TO FORGIVE AND FORGET WASH WILLIAMS STOPPED AND STOOD STARING AT GEORGE WILLARD
233-134440-0057 AGAIN THE MAN'S VOICE BECAME SOFT AND LOW SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM NAKED HE WENT ON HER MOTHER DID THAT WHILE I SAT THERE SHE WAS TAKING THE GIRL'S CLOTHES OFF PERHAPS COAXING HER TO DO IT
233-134440-0058 FIRST I HEARD VOICES AT THE DOOR THAT LED INTO A LITTLE HALLWAY
233-134440-0059 THE GIRL WAS ASHAMED AND STOOD PERFECTLY STILL STARING AT THE FLOOR THE MOTHER DIDN'T COME INTO THE ROOM WHEN SHE HAD PUSHED THE GIRL IN THROUGH THE DOOR SHE STOOD IN THE HALLWAY WAITING HOPING WE WOULD WELL
233-134440-0060 YOU SEE WAITING GEORGE WILLARD AND THE TELEGRAPH OPERATOR CAME INTO THE MAIN STREET OF WINESBURG THE LIGHTS FROM THE STORE WINDOWS LAY BRIGHT AND SHINING ON THE SIDEWALKS PEOPLE MOVED ABOUT LAUGHING AND TALKING
233-134440-0061 THE YOUNG REPORTER FELT ILL AND WEAK IN IMAGINATION HE ALSO BECAME OLD AND SHAPELESS I DIDN'T GET THE MOTHER KILLED SAID WASH WILLIAMS STARING UP AND DOWN THE STREET I STRUCK HER ONCE WITH A CHAIR
233-134440-0062 AND THEN THE NEIGHBORS CAME IN AND TOOK IT AWAY
233-155990-0000 THE PEACE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS
233-155990-0001 THERE CAN BE NO NOBLER CAUSE FOR WHICH TO WORK THAN THE PEACE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HIGH HONOR IS DUE THOSE SERENE AND LOFTY SOULS WHO WITH WISDOM AND COURAGE
233-155990-0002 WITH HIGH IDEALISM TEMPERED BY SANE FACING OF THE ACTUAL FACTS OF LIFE HAVE STRIVEN TO BRING NEARER THE DAY WHEN ARMED STRIFE BETWEEN NATION AND NATION BETWEEN CLASS AND CLASS
233-155990-0003 BETWEEN MAN AND MAN SHALL END THROUGHOUT THE WORLD BECAUSE ALL THIS IS TRUE IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THERE ARE NO MEN MORE IGNOBLE OR MORE FOOLISH NO MEN WHOSE ACTIONS ARE FRAUGHT WITH GREATER POSSIBILITY OF MISCHIEF
233-155990-0004 TO THEIR COUNTRY AND TO MANKIND THAN THOSE WHO EXALT UNRIGHTEOUS PEACE AS BETTER THAN RIGHTEOUS WAR THE MEN WHO HAVE STOOD HIGHEST IN OUR HISTORY AS IN THE HISTORY OF ALL COUNTRIES ARE THOSE WHO SCORNED INJUSTICE
233-155990-0005 WHO WERE INCAPABLE OF OPPRESSING THE WEAK OR OF PERMITTING THEIR COUNTRY WITH THEIR CONSENT TO OPPRESS THE WEAK BUT WHO DID NOT HESITATE TO DRAW THE SWORD WHEN TO LEAVE IT UNDRAWN MEANT INABILITY TO ARREST TRIUMPHANT WRONG
233-155990-0006 YET EVERY MAN IN ACTIVE AFFAIRS WHO ALSO READS ABOUT THE PAST GROWS BY BITTER EXPERIENCE TO REALIZE THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF MEN NOT ONLY AMONG THOSE WHO MEAN ILL BUT AMONG THOSE WHO MEAN WELL
233-155990-0007 WHO ARE READY ENOUGH TO PRAISE WHAT WAS DONE IN THE PAST AND YET ARE INCAPABLE OF PROFITING BY IT WHEN FACED BY THE NEEDS OF THE PRESENT DURING OUR GENERATION THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN PECULIARLY THE CASE AMONG THE MEN
233-155990-0008 WHO HAVE BECOME OBSESSED WITH THE IDEA OF OBTAINING UNIVERSAL PEACE BY SOME CHEAP PATENT PANACEA THERE HAS BEEN A REAL AND SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH
233-155990-0009 IN THE FEELING FOR INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND JUSTICE AMONG THE GREAT CIVILIZED NATIONS DURING THE PAST THREESCORE OR FOURSCORE YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A REAL GROWTH OF RECOGNITION OF THE FACT
233-155990-0010 AND THAT IN MOST CASES WAR IS AN EVIL METHOD OF SETTLING INTERNATIONAL DIFFICULTIES BUT AS YET THERE HAS BEEN ONLY A RUDIMENTARY BEGINNING OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNALS OF JUSTICE
233-155990-0011 AND THERE HAS BEEN NO DEVELOPMENT AT ALL OF ANY INTERNATIONAL POLICE POWER NOW AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID THE WHOLE FABRIC OF MUNICIPAL LAW OF LAW WITHIN EACH NATION
233-155990-0012 RESTS ULTIMATELY UPON THE JUDGE AND THE POLICEMAN AND THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF THE POLICEMAN AND THE ALMOST COMPLETE ABSENCE OF THE JUDGE IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS PREVENTS THERE BEING AS YET ANY REAL HOMOLOGY
233-155990-0013 BETWEEN MUNICIPAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW MOREOVER THE QUESTIONS WHICH SOMETIMES INVOLVE NATIONS IN WAR ARE FAR MORE DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX THAN ANY QUESTIONS THAT AFFECT MERELY INDIVIDUALS
233-155990-0014 ALMOST EVERY GREAT NATION HAS INHERITED CERTAIN QUESTIONS EITHER WITH OTHER NATIONS OR WITH SECTIONS OF ITS OWN PEOPLE WHICH IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CIVILIZATION TO DECIDE
233-155990-0015 AS MATTERS BETWEEN PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS CAN BE DECIDED DURING THE LAST CENTURY AT LEAST HALF OF THE WARS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUGHT HAVE BEEN CIVIL AND NOT FOREIGN WARS THERE ARE BIG AND POWERFUL NATIONS WHICH HABITUALLY COMMIT EITHER UPON OTHER NATIONS
233-155990-0016 OR UPON SECTIONS OF THEIR OWN PEOPLE WRONGS SO OUTRAGEOUS AS TO JUSTIFY EVEN THE MOST PEACEFUL PERSONS IN GOING TO WAR THERE ARE ALSO WEAK NATIONS SO UTTERLY INCOMPETENT
233-155990-0017 EITHER TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF FOREIGNERS AGAINST THEIR OWN CITIZENS OR TO PROTECT THEIR OWN CITIZENS AGAINST FOREIGNERS THAT IT BECOMES A MATTER OF SHEER DUTY FOR SOME OUTSIDE POWER TO INTERFERE IN CONNECTION WITH THEM
233-155990-0018 AS YET IN NEITHER CASE IS THERE ANY EFFICIENT METHOD OF GETTING INTERNATIONAL ACTION AND IF JOINT ACTION BY SEVERAL POWERS IS SECURED THE RESULT IS USUALLY CONSIDERABLY WORSE THAN IF ONLY ONE POWER INTERFERED
233-155990-0019 THE WORST INFAMIES OF MODERN TIMES SUCH AFFAIRS AS THE MASSACRES OF THE ARMENIANS BY THE TURKS FOR INSTANCE HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED IN A TIME OF NOMINALLY PROFOUND INTERNATIONAL PEACE
233-155990-0020 WHEN THERE HAS BEEN A CONCERT OF BIG POWERS TO PREVENT THE BREAKING OF THIS PEACE ALTHOUGH ONLY BY BREAKING IT COULD THE OUTRAGES BE STOPPED BE IT REMEMBERED THAT THE PEOPLES WHO SUFFERED BY THESE HIDEOUS MASSACRES WHO SAW THEIR WOMEN VIOLATED
233-155990-0021 OTHERWISE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASSACRED FOR IF THE JEWS IN RUSSIA AND THE ARMENIANS IN TURKEY HAD BEEN ARMED AND HAD BEEN EFFICIENT IN THE USE OF THEIR ARMS NO MOB WOULD HAVE MEDDLED WITH THEM
233-155990-0022 YET AMIABLE BUT FATUOUS PERSONS WITH ALL THESE FACTS BEFORE THEIR EYES PASS RESOLUTIONS DEMANDING UNIVERSAL ARBITRATION FOR EVERYTHING
233-155990-0023 AND THEIR ABANDONMENT OF THEIR ARMED FORCES OR ELSE THEY WRITE WELL MEANING SOLEMN LITTLE BOOKS OR PAMPHLETS OR EDITORIALS AND ARTICLES IN MAGAZINES OR NEWSPAPERS TO SHOW
233-155990-0024 BECAUSE IT IS EXPENSIVE THIS IS PRECISELY LIKE ARGUING THAT WE SHOULD DISBAND THE POLICE AND DEVOTE OUR SOLE ATTENTION TO PERSUADING CRIMINALS
233-155990-0025 SUPPOSE THAT BURGLARY HIGHWAY ROBBERY AND WHITE SLAVERY ARE PROFITABLE IT IS ALMOST USELESS TO ATTEMPT TO ARGUE WITH THESE WELL INTENTIONED PERSONS BECAUSE THEY ARE SUFFERING UNDER AN OBSESSION AND ARE NOT OPEN TO REASON
233-155990-0026 THEY GO WRONG AT THE OUTSET FOR THEY LAY ALL THE EMPHASIS ON PEACE AND NONE AT ALL ON RIGHTEOUSNESS THEY ARE NOT ALL OF THEM PHYSICALLY TIMID MEN BUT THEY ARE USUALLY MEN
233-155990-0027 FROM INSULTING OR WRONGING THE PEOPLE OF OTHER NATIONS BUT THEY ALWAYS ARDENTLY ADVOCATE THAT WE IN OUR TURN SHALL TAMELY SUBMIT TO WRONG AND INSULT FROM OTHER NATIONS
233-155990-0028 AS AMERICANS THEIR FOLLY IS PECULIARLY SCANDALOUS BECAUSE IF THE PRINCIPLES THEY NOW UPHOLD ARE RIGHT IT MEANS THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAT AMERICANS SHOULD NEVER HAVE ACHIEVED THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND BETTER THAT
233-155990-0029 IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE THEY SHOULD HAVE PEACEFULLY SUBMITTED TO SEEING THEIR COUNTRY SPLIT INTO HALF A DOZEN JANGLING CONFEDERACIES AND SLAVERY MADE PERPETUAL IF UNWILLING TO LEARN FROM THEIR OWN HISTORY
233-155990-0030 LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHINA AND JAPAN CHINA HAS NEITHER A FLEET NOR AN EFFICIENT ARMY IT IS A HUGE CIVILIZED EMPIRE ONE OF THE MOST POPULOUS ON THE GLOBE AND IT HAS BEEN THE HELPLESS PREY
233-155990-0031 OF OUTSIDERS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT POSSESS THE POWER TO FIGHT JAPAN STANDS ON A FOOTING OF EQUALITY WITH EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN NATIONS BECAUSE IT DOES POSSESS THIS POWER CHINA NOW SEES JAPAN
233-155990-0032 RUSSIA GERMANY ENGLAND AND FRANCE IN POSSESSION OF FRAGMENTS OF HER EMPIRE AND HAS TWICE WITHIN THE LIFETIME OF THE PRESENT GENERATION SEEN HER CAPITAL IN THE HANDS OF ALLIED INVADERS BECAUSE SHE IN VERY FACT
233-155990-0033 REALIZES THE IDEALS OF THE PERSONS WHO WISH THE UNITED STATES TO DISARM AND THEN TRUST THAT OUR HELPLESSNESS WILL SECURE US A CONTEMPTUOUS IMMUNITY FROM ATTACK BY OUTSIDE NATIONS
233-155990-0034 THE CHIEF TROUBLE COMES FROM THE ENTIRE INABILITY OF THESE WORTHY PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE DEMANDING THINGS THAT ARE MUTUALLY INCOMPATIBLE WHEN THEY DEMAND PEACE AT ANY PRICE AND ALSO JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS
233-155990-0035 I REMEMBER ONE REPRESENTATIVE OF THEIR NUMBER WHO USED TO WRITE LITTLE SONNETS ON BEHALF OF THE MAHDI AND THE SUDANESE THESE SONNETS SETTING FORTH THE NEED THAT THE SUDAN SHOULD BE BOTH INDEPENDENT AND PEACEFUL
233-155990-0036 AS A MATTER OF FACT THE SUDAN VALUED INDEPENDENCE ONLY BECAUSE IT DESIRED TO WAR AGAINST ALL CHRISTIANS AND TO CARRY ON AN UNLIMITED SLAVE TRADE
233-155990-0037 UNDER THE MAHDI FOR A DOZEN YEARS AND DURING THOSE DOZEN YEARS THE BIGOTRY TYRANNY AND CRUEL RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE WERE SUCH AS FLOURISHED IN THE SEVENTH CENTURY AND IN SPITE OF SYSTEMATIC SLAVE RAIDS
233-155990-0038 THE POPULATION DECREASED BY NEARLY TWO THIRDS AND PRACTICALLY ALL THE CHILDREN DIED PEACE CAME WELL BEING CAME FREEDOM FROM RAPE AND MURDER AND TORTURE AND HIGHWAY ROBBERY AND EVERY BRUTAL GRATIFICATION OF LUST AND GREED CAME
233-155990-0039 ONLY WHEN THE SUDAN LOST ITS INDEPENDENCE AND PASSED UNDER ENGLISH RULE YET THIS WELL MEANING LITTLE SONNETEER SINCERELY FELT THAT HIS VERSES WERE ISSUED IN THE CAUSE OF HUMANITY
233-155990-0040 LOOKING BACK FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF A SCORE OF YEARS PROBABLY EVERY ONE WILL AGREE THAT HE WAS AN ABSURD PERSON BUT HE WAS NOT ONE WHIT MORE ABSURD THAN MOST OF THE MORE PROMINENT PERSONS WHO ADVOCATE DISARMAMENT BY THE UNITED STATES
233-155990-0041 THE CESSATION OF UP BUILDING THE NAVY AND THE PROMISE TO AGREE TO ARBITRATE ALL MATTERS INCLUDING THOSE AFFECTING OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS AND HONOR WITH ALL FOREIGN NATIONS THESE PERSONS WOULD DO NO HARM
233-155990-0042 IF THEY AFFECTED ONLY THEMSELVES MANY OF THEM ARE IN THE ORDINARY RELATIONS OF LIFE GOOD CITIZENS THEY ARE EXACTLY LIKE THE OTHER GOOD CITIZENS WHO BELIEVE THAT ENFORCED UNIVERSAL VEGETARIANISM OR ANTI VACCINATION
233-155990-0043 IS THE PANACEA FOR ALL ILLS BUT IN THEIR PARTICULAR CASE THEY ARE ABLE TO DO HARM BECAUSE THEY AFFECT OUR RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN POWERS SO THAT OTHER MEN PAY THE DEBT WHICH THEY THEMSELVES HAVE REALLY INCURRED
233-155990-0044 IT IS THE FOOLISH PEACE AT ANY PRICE PERSONS WHO TRY TO PERSUADE OUR PEOPLE TO MAKE UNWISE AND IMPROPER TREATIES OR TO STOP BUILDING UP THE NAVY BUT IF TROUBLE COMES AND THE TREATIES ARE REPUDIATED
233-155990-0045 IT IS NOT THESE PEOPLE WHO WILL PAY ANYTHING THEY WILL STAY AT HOME IN SAFETY AND LEAVE BRAVE MEN TO PAY IN BLOOD AND HONEST MEN TO PAY IN SHAME FOR THEIR FOLLY THE TROUBLE IS THAT OUR POLICY IS APT TO GO IN ZIGZAGS
233-155990-0046 BECAUSE DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF OUR PEOPLE EXERCISE AT DIFFERENT TIMES UNEQUAL PRESSURE ON OUR GOVERNMENT ONE CLASS OF OUR CITIZENS CLAMORS FOR TREATIES IMPOSSIBLE OF FULFILMENT AND IMPROPER TO FULFIL
2384-152900-0000 SO FAR I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH OUR GENERAL OUTFIT AND SHALL NOW PASS TO THE SPECIAL EQUIPMENT OF THE SHORE PARTY THE HUT WE TOOK OUT WAS BUILT ON MY PROPERTY ON BUNDEFJORD SO THAT I WAS ABLE TO WATCH THE WORK AS IT PROGRESSED
2384-152900-0001 IT WAS BUILT BY THE BROTHERS HANS AND JOERGEN STUBBERUD AND WAS THROUGHOUT A SPLENDID PIECE OF WORK WHICH DID HONOUR TO BOTH THE BROTHERS THE MATERIALS PROVED EXCELLENT IN EVERY WAY THE HUT WAS TWENTY SIX FEET LONG BY THIRTEEN FEET WIDE
2384-152900-0002 ITS HEIGHT FROM THE FLOOR TO THE RIDGE OF THE ROOF WAS ABOUT TWELVE FEET IT WAS BUILT AS AN ORDINARY NORWEGIAN HOUSE WITH POINTED GABLE AND HAD TWO ROOMS ONE OF THESE WAS NINETEEN AND A HALF FEET LONG AND WAS TO SERVE AS OUR DORMITORY DINING ROOM AND SITTING ROOM
2384-152900-0003 THE OTHER ROOM WAS SIX AND A HALF FEET LONG AND WAS TO BE LINDSTROEM'S KITCHEN FROM THE KITCHEN A DOUBLE TRAP DOOR LED TO THE LOFT WHERE WE INTENDED TO KEEP A QUANTITY OF PROVISIONS AND OUTFIT THE WALLS CONSISTED OF THREE INCH PLANKS
2384-152900-0004 FOR INSULATION WE USED CELLULOSE PULP THE FLOOR AND THE CEILING BETWEEN THE ROOMS AND THE LOFT WERE DOUBLE
2384-152900-0005 THE DOORS WERE EXTRAORDINARILY THICK AND STRONG AND FITTED INTO OBLIQUE GROOVES SO THAT THEY CLOSED VERY TIGHTLY THERE WERE TWO WINDOWS A TRIPLE ONE IN THE END WALL OF THE MAIN ROOM AND A DOUBLE ONE IN THE KITCHEN
2384-152900-0006 FOR THE COVERING OF THE ROOF WE TOOK OUT ROOFING PAPER AND FOR THE FLOOR LINOLEUM IN THE MAIN ROOM THERE WERE TWO AIR PIPES
2384-152900-0007 THERE WERE BUNKS FOR TEN MEN IN TWO STAGES SIX ON ONE WALL AND FOUR ON THE OTHER THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOM CONSISTED OF A TABLE A STOOL FOR EACH MAN AND A LUX LAMP
2384-152900-0008 THE HUT WAS TARRED SEVERAL TIMES AND EVERY PART WAS CAREFULLY MARKED SO THAT IT COULD EASILY BE SET UP TO FASTEN IT TO THE GROUND AND PREVENT THE ANTARCTIC STORMS FROM BLOWING IT AWAY I HAD STRONG EYEBOLTS SCREWED INTO EACH END OF THE ROOF RIDGE
2384-152900-0009 AND THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE ROOF WE CARRIED SIX STRONG EYEBOLTS A METRE LONG TO BE RAMMED INTO THE BARRIER BETWEEN THESE BOLTS AND THOSE ON THE HUT STEEL WIRES WERE TO BE STRETCHED WHICH COULD BE DRAWN QUITE TIGHT WE ALSO HAD TWO SPARE CABLES
2384-152900-0010 WHICH COULD BE STRETCHED OVER THE ROOF IF THE GALES WERE TOO SEVERE THE TWO VENTILATING PIPES AND THE CHIMNEY WERE SECURED OUTSIDE WITH STRONG STAYS AS WILL BE SEEN EVERY PRECAUTION WAS TAKEN TO MAKE THE HUT WARM AND COMFORTABLE
2384-152900-0011 AND TO HOLD IT DOWN ON THE GROUND WE ALSO TOOK ON BOARD A QUANTITY OF LOOSE TIMBER BOARDS AND PLANKS BESIDES THE HUT WE TOOK WITH US FIFTEEN TENTS FOR SIXTEEN MEN EACH TEN OF THESE WERE OLD BUT GOOD
2384-152900-0012 THEY WERE SERVED OUT TO US FROM THE NAVAL STORES THE OTHER FIVE WERE NEW AND WE BOUGHT THEM FROM THE ARMY DEPOTS IT WAS OUR INTENTION TO USE THE TENTS AS TEMPORARY HOUSES THEY WERE EASILY AND QUICKLY SET UP AND WERE STRONG AND WARM
2384-152900-0013 ON THE VOYAGE TO THE SOUTH ROENNE SEWED NEW FLOORS OF GOOD STRONG CANVAS TO THE FIVE NEW TENTS ALL CASES OF PROVISIONS THAT WERE INTENDED FOR WINTER QUARTERS WERE MARKED AND STOWED SEPARATELY IN THE HOLD
2384-152900-0014 WE HAD TEN SLEDGES MADE BY A FIRM OF SPORTING OUTFITTERS IN CHRISTIANIA THEY WERE BUILT LIKE THE OLD NANSEN SLEDGES BUT RATHER BROADER AND WERE TWELVE FEET LONG THE RUNNERS WERE OF THE BEST AMERICAN HICKORY SHOD WITH STEEL
2384-152900-0015 THE OTHER PARTS WERE OF GOOD TOUGH NORWEGIAN ASH TO EACH SLEDGE BELONGED A PAIR OF SPARE RUNNERS WHICH COULD EASILY BE FITTED UNDERNEATH BY MEANS OF CLAMPS AND AS EASILY REMOVED WHEN NOT REQUIRED
2384-152900-0016 THE STEEL SHOEING OF THE RUNNERS WAS WELL COATED WITH RED LEAD AND THE SPARE RUNNERS WITH TAR THESE SLEDGES WERE EXTREMELY STRONGLY BUILT AND COULD STAND ALL KINDS OF WORK ON EVERY SORT OF SURFACE AT THAT TIME
2384-152900-0017 I DID NOT KNOW THE CONDITIONS ON THE BARRIER AS I AFTERWARDS CAME TO KNOW THEM OF COURSE THESE SLEDGES WERE VERY HEAVY WE TOOK TWENTY PAIRS OF SKI ALL OF THE FINEST HICKORY THEY WERE EIGHT FEET LONG AND PROPORTIONATELY NARROW
2384-152900-0018 I CHOSE THEM OF THIS LENGTH WITH A VIEW TO BEING ABLE TO CROSS THE NUMEROUS CRACKS IN THE GLACIERS THE GREATER THE SURFACE OVER WHICH THE WEIGHT COULD BE DISTRIBUTED THE BETTER PROSPECT WE SHOULD HAVE OF SLIPPING OVER THE SNOW BRIDGES
2384-152900-0019 WE HAD FORTY SKI POLES WITH EBONITE POINTS THE SKI BINDINGS WERE A COMBINATION OF THE HUITFELDT AND THE HOEYER ELLEFSEN BINDINGS WE ALSO HAD QUANTITIES OF LOOSE STRAPS
2384-152900-0020 WE HAD SIX THREE MAN TENTS ALL MADE IN THE NAVY WORKSHOPS THE WORKMANSHIP COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER THEY WERE THE STRONGEST AND MOST PRACTICAL TENTS THAT HAVE EVER BEEN USED THEY WERE MADE OF THE CLOSEST CANVAS WITH THE FLOOR IN ONE PIECE
2384-152900-0021 ONE MAN WAS SUFFICIENT TO SET UP THE TENT IN THE STIFFEST BREEZE I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE FEWER POLES A TENT HAS THE EASIER IT IS TO SET UP WHICH SEEMS QUITE NATURAL THESE TENTS HAVE ONLY ONE POLE
2384-152900-0022 HOW OFTEN ONE READS IN NARRATIVES OF POLAR TRAVEL THAT IT TOOK SUCH AND SUCH A TIME OFTEN HOURS TO SET UP THE TENT AND THEN WHEN AT LAST IT WAS UP ONE LAY EXPECTING IT TO BE BLOWN DOWN AT ANY MOMENT
2384-152900-0023 THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF THIS WITH OUR TENTS THEY WERE UP IN A TWINKLING AND STOOD AGAINST ALL KINDS OF WIND WE COULD LIE SECURELY IN OUR SLEEPING BAGS AND LET IT BLOW THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE DOOR WAS ON THE USUAL SACK PRINCIPLE
2384-152900-0024 WHICH CAME FROM THE ESTATE OF PALSGAARD IN JUTLAND AND THE MATERIAL DID ALL IT PROMISED THESE CASES WERE ONE FOOT SQUARE AND FIFTEEN AND A HALF INCHES HIGH
2384-152900-0025 THEY HAD ONLY A LITTLE ROUND OPENING ON THE TOP CLOSED WITH AN ALUMINIUM LID WHICH FITTED EXACTLY LIKE THE LID OF A MILK CAN LARGE LIDS WEAKEN THE CASES AND I HAD THEREFORE CHOSEN THIS FORM WE DID NOT HAVE TO THROW OFF THE LASHING OF THE CASE TO GET THE LID OFF
2384-152900-0026 AND THIS IS A VERY GREAT ADVANTAGE WE COULD ALWAYS GET AT IT A CASE WITH A LARGE LID COVERED BY THE LASHING GIVES CONSTANT TROUBLE THE WHOLE LASHING HAS TO BE UNDONE FOR EVERY LITTLE THING ONE WANTS OUT OF THE CASE THIS IS NOT ALWAYS CONVENIENT
2384-152900-0027 IF ONE IS TIRED AND SLACK IT MAY SOMETIMES HAPPEN THAT ONE WILL PUT OFF TILL TO MORROW WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE TO DAY ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS BITTERLY COLD
2384-152900-0028 THE HANDIER ONE'S SLEDGING OUTFIT THE SOONER ONE GETS INTO THE TENT AND TO REST AND THAT IS NO SMALL CONSIDERATION ON A LONG JOURNEY OUR OUTFIT OF CLOTHING WAS ABUNDANT AND MORE COMPLETE I SUPPOSE THAN THAT OF ANY FORMER POLAR EXPEDITION
2384-152900-0029 WE MAY DIVIDE IT INTO TWO CLASSES THE OUTFIT FOR SPECIALLY LOW TEMPERATURES AND THAT FOR MORE MODERATE TEMPERATURES IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT NO ONE HAD YET WINTERED ON THE BARRIER SO WE HAD TO BE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING
2384-152900-0030 IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GRAPPLE WITH ANY DEGREE OF COLD WE WERE SUPPLIED WITH THE RICHEST ASSORTMENT OF REINDEER SKIN CLOTHING WE HAD IT SPECIALLY THICK MEDIUM AND QUITE LIGHT IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET THESE SKIN CLOTHES PREPARED
2384-152900-0031 FIRST THE REINDEER SKINS HAD TO BE BOUGHT IN A RAW STATE
2384-152900-0032 LET ME TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF THANKING THIS MAN FOR THE MANY AND GREAT SERVICES HE HAS RENDERED ME NOT ONLY DURING MY PREPARATIONS FOR THE THIRD VOYAGE OF THE FRAM
2384-152900-0033 WITH HIS HELP I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING THINGS THAT I SHOULD OTHERWISE NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET HE SHRANK FROM NO AMOUNT OF WORK BUT WENT ON TILL HE HAD FOUND WHAT I WANTED
2384-152900-0034 THIS TIME HE PROCURED NEARLY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY GOOD REINDEER SKINS DRESSED BY THE LAPPS AND SENT THEM TO CHRISTIANIA HERE I HAD GREAT TROUBLE IN FINDING A MAN WHO COULD SEW SKINS BUT AT LAST I FOUND ONE
2384-152900-0035 WE THEN WENT TO WORK TO MAKE CLOTHES AFTER THE PATTERN OF THE NETCHELLI ESKIMO AND THE SEWING WENT ON EARLY AND LATE THICK ANORAKS AND THIN ONES HEAVY BREECHES AND LIGHT WINTER STOCKINGS AND SUMMER STOCKINGS
2384-152900-0036 WE ALSO HAD A DOZEN THIN SLEEPING BAGS WHICH I THOUGHT OF USING INSIDE THE BIG THICK ONES IF THE COLD SHOULD BE TOO SEVERE EVERYTHING WAS FINISHED BUT NOT UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT THE OUTER SLEEPING BAGS WERE MADE BY MISTER BRANDT FURRIER OF BERGEN
2384-152900-0037 AND THEY WERE SO EXCELLENT BOTH IN MATERIAL AND MAKING UP THAT NO ONE IN THE WORLD COULD HAVE DONE BETTER IT WAS A MODEL PIECE OF WORK TO SAVE THIS OUTER SLEEPING BAG WE HAD IT PROVIDED WITH A COVER OF THE LIGHTEST CANVAS
2384-152900-0038 WHICH WAS A GOOD DEAL LONGER THAN THE BAG ITSELF IT WAS EASY TO TIE THE END OF THE COVER TOGETHER LIKE THE MOUTH OF THE SACK AND THIS KEPT THE SNOW OUT OF THE BAG DURING THE DAY'S MARCH
2384-152900-0039 IN THIS WAY WE ALWAYS KEPT OURSELVES FREE FROM THE ANNOYANCE OF DRIFTING SNOW WE ATTACHED GREAT IMPORTANCE TO HAVING THE BAGS MADE OF THE VERY BEST SORT OF SKIN AND TOOK CARE THAT THE THIN SKIN OF THE BELLY WAS REMOVED
2384-152900-0040 AS OF COURSE THE COLD PENETRATES MORE EASILY THROUGH THE THIN SKIN AND GIVES RISE TO DAMPNESS IN THE FORM OF RIME ON MEETING THE WARMTH OF THE BODY THESE THIN PATCHES REMAIN DAMP WHENEVER ONE IS IN THE BAG AND IN A SHORT TIME THEY LOSE THEIR HAIR
2384-152900-0041 THE DAMP SPREADS LIKE DECAY IN WOOD AND CONTINUALLY ATTACKS THE SURROUNDING SKIN WITH THE RESULT THAT ONE FINE DAY YOU FIND YOURSELF WITH A HAIRLESS SLEEPING BAG
2384-152900-0042 OUR BURBERRY WIND CLOTHES WERE MADE IN THE FORM OF ANORAK BLOUSE AND TROUSERS BOTH VERY ROOMY THE OTHERS CONSISTED OF TROUSERS AND JACKET WITH HOOD OUR MITS WERE FOR THE MOST PART SUCH AS ONE CAN BUY IN ANY SHOP
2384-152900-0043 WE WANTED NOTHING ELSE IN AND AROUND WINTER QUARTERS OUTSIDE THE MITS WE WORE AN OUTER COVERING OF WINDPROOF MATERIAL SO AS NOT TO WEAR THEM OUT TOO QUICKLY THESE MITS ARE NOT VERY STRONG THOUGH THEY ARE GOOD AND WARM
2384-152900-0044 BESIDES THESE WE HAD TEN PAIRS OF ORDINARY KID MITS WHICH WERE BOUGHT AT A GLOVE SHOP IN CHRISTIANIA AND WERE PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO WEAR OUT I WORE MINE FROM FRAMHEIM TO THE POLE AND BACK AGAIN AND AFTERWARDS ON THE VOYAGE TO TASMANIA
2384-152900-0045 THE LINING OF COURSE WAS TORN IN PLACES BUT THE SEAMS OF THE MITS WERE JUST AS PERFECT AS THE DAY I BOUGHT THEM TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT I WENT ON SKI THE WHOLE WAY AND USED TWO POLES IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MITS WERE STRONGLY MADE
2384-152900-0046 WE ALSO HAD A NUMBER OF WOOLLEN GLOVES WHICH CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE OTHERS GREATLY PRIZED FOR MYSELF I WAS NEVER ABLE TO WEAR SUCH THINGS THEY SIMPLY FREEZE THE FINGERS OFF ME BUT MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL IS THE COVERING OF THE FEET
2384-152900-0047 FOR THE FEET ARE THE MOST EXPOSED MEMBERS AND THE MOST DIFFICULT TO PROTECT ONE CAN LOOK AFTER THE HANDS
2384-152900-0048 AND THIS IS A SUFFICIENTLY TROUBLESOME PIECE OF WORK TO MAKE ONE DISINCLINED TO UNDO IT AGAIN UNTIL ONE IS TURNING IN THEY CANNOT BE SEEN IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY AND ONE HAS TO DEPEND ENTIRELY ON FEELING BUT FEELING IN THIS CASE OFTEN PLAYS CURIOUS TRICKS
2384-152900-0049 FOR IF THEY HAD KNOWN IT THEY COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE LET IT GO SO FAR THE FACT IS THAT IN THIS CASE SENSATION IS A SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL GUIDE FOR THE FEET LOSE ALL SENSATION
2384-152900-0050 IT IS TRUE THAT THERE IS A TRANSITIONAL STAGE WHEN ONE FEELS THE COLD SMARTING IN ONE'S TOES AND TRIES TO GET RID OF IT BY STAMPING THE FEET AS A RULE THIS IS SUCCESSFUL THE WARMTH RETURNS OR THE CIRCULATION IS RESTORED
2384-152900-0051 BUT IT OCCASIONALLY HAPPENS THAT SENSATION IS LOST AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THESE PRECAUTIONS ARE TAKEN AND THEN ONE MUST BE AN OLD HAND TO KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED MANY MEN CONCLUDE THAT AS THEY NO LONGER FEEL THE UNPLEASANT SMARTING SENSATION ALL IS WELL
2384-152900-0052 AND AT THE EVENING INSPECTION A FROZEN FOOT OF TALLOW LIKE APPEARANCE PRESENTS ITSELF AN EVENT OF THIS KIND MAY RUIN THE MOST ELABORATELY PREPARED ENTERPRISE AND IT IS THEREFORE ADVISABLE IN THE MATTER OF FEET
2384-152900-0053 TO CARRY ONE'S CAUTION TO LENGTHS WHICH MAY SEEM RIDICULOUS NOW IT IS A FACT THAT IF ONE CAN WEAR SOFT FOOT GEAR EXCLUSIVELY THE RISK OF FROST BITE IS FAR LESS THAN IF ONE IS COMPELLED TO WEAR STIFF BOOTS IN SOFT FOOT GEAR OF COURSE
2384-152900-0054 THE FOOT CAN MOVE FAR MORE EASILY AND KEEP WARM BUT WE WERE TO TAKE SKI AND TO GET FULL USE OUT OF THEM SO THAT IN ANY CASE WE HAD TO HAVE A STIFF SOLE FOR THE SAKE OF THE BINDINGS IT IS OF NO USE TO HAVE A GOOD BINDING UNLESS YOU CAN USE IT IN THE RIGHT WAY
2384-152900-0055 IN MY OPINION ON A LONG JOURNEY SUCH AS THAT WE HAD BEFORE US THE SKI MUST BE PERFECTLY STEADY I DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING THAT TIRES ME MORE THAN A BAD FASTENING THAT IS ONE THAT ALLOWS THE FOOT TO SHIFT IN THE BINDING
2384-152900-0056 I WANT THE SKI TO BE A PART OF ONESELF SO THAT ONE ALWAYS HAS FULL COMMAND OF THEM I HAVE TRIED MANY PATENTS FOR I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AFRAID OF A STIFF FASTENING IN COLD TEMPERATURES BUT ALL THESE PATENTS WITHOUT EXCEPTION ARE WORTHLESS IN THE LONG RUN
2384-152900-0057 I DECIDED THIS TIME TO TRY A COMBINATION OF STIFF AND SOFT FOOT GEAR SO THAT WE COULD USE THE SPLENDID HUITFELDT HOEYER ELLEFSEN BINDINGS BUT THIS WAS NO EASY MATTER OF OUR WHOLE OUTFIT NOTHING CAUSED ME MORE WORRY
2384-152900-0058 OR GAVE US ALL MORE WORK IN THE COURSE OF THE EXPEDITION THAN THE STIFF OUTER COVERING WHICH WE HAD TO HAVE BUT WE SOLVED THE PROBLEM AT LAST I APPLIED TO ONE OF THE LEADING MAKERS OF SKI BOOTS IN CHRISTIANIA AND EXPLAINED THE DIFFICULTY TO HIM
2384-152900-0059 FORTUNATELY I HAD FOUND A MAN WHO WAS EVIDENTLY INTERESTED IN THE QUESTION WE AGREED THAT HE SHOULD MAKE A SAMPLE PAIR AFTER THE PATTERN OF SKI BOOTS THE SOLE WAS TO BE THICK AND STIFF FOR WE HAD TO BE PREPARED TO USE CRAMPONS BUT THE UPPERS AS SOFT AS POSSIBLE
2384-152900-0060 IN ORDER TO AVOID LEATHER WHICH USUALLY BECOMES STIFF AND EASILY CRACKED IN THE COLD HE WAS TO USE A COMBINATION OF LEATHER AND THIN CANVAS FOR THE UPPERS LEATHER NEAREST THE SOLE AND CANVAS ABOVE IT THE MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN FROM MY FOOT
2384-152900-0061 WHICH IS NOT EXACTLY A CHILD'S FOOT WITH TWO PAIRS OF REINDEER SKIN STOCKINGS ON AND TEN PAIRS WERE MADE
2384-152900-0062 THEY WERE EXHIBITED IN THE BOOTMAKER'S WINDOWS I USED TO GO A LONG WAY ROUND TO AVOID COMING FACE TO FACE WITH THESE MONSTERS IN PUBLIC WE ARE ALL A TRIFLE VAIN AND DISLIKE HAVING OUR OWN SHORTCOMINGS SHOWN UP IN ELECTRIC LIGHT
2384-152900-0063 IF I HAD EVER CHERISHED ANY ILLUSIONS ON THE SUBJECT OF A DAINTY LITTLE FOOT I AM SURE THE LAST TRACE OF SUCH VANITY DIED OUT ON THE DAY I PASSED THE SHOEMAKER'S WINDOW AND BEHELD MY OWN BOOTS
2384-152900-0064 I NEVER WENT THAT WAY AGAIN UNTIL I WAS CERTAIN THAT THE EXHIBITION WAS CLOSED ONE THING IS CERTAIN THAT THE BOOTS WERE A FINE PIECE OF WORKMANSHIP WE SHALL HEAR LATER ON OF THE ALTERATIONS THEY HAD TO UNDERGO BEFORE WE AT LAST MADE THEM AS LARGE AS WE WANTED
2384-152900-0065 FOR THE GIANT BOOTS TURNED OUT MUCH TOO SMALL AMONG OTHER EQUIPMENT I MUST MENTION OUR EXCELLENT PRIMUS COOKING APPARATUS THIS ALL CAME COMPLETE FROM A FIRM IN STOCKHOLM FOR COOKING ON SLEDGE JOURNEYS THE PRIMUS STOVE RANKS ABOVE ALL OTHERS
2384-152900-0066 IT GIVES A GREAT DEAL OF HEAT USES LITTLE OIL AND REQUIRES NO ATTENTION ADVANTAGES WHICH ARE IMPORTANT ENOUGH ANYWHERE BUT ESPECIALLY WHEN SLEDGING THERE IS NEVER ANY TROUBLE WITH THIS APPARATUS IT HAS COME AS NEAR PERFECTION AS POSSIBLE
2384-152900-0067 WE TOOK FIVE NANSEN COOKERS WITH US THIS COOKER UTILIZES THE HEAT MORE COMPLETELY THAN ANY OTHER BUT I HAVE ONE OBJECTION TO MAKE TO IT IT TAKES UP SPACE WE USED IT ON OUR DEPOT JOURNEYS
2384-152900-0068 BUT WERE UNFORTUNATELY OBLIGED TO GIVE IT UP ON THE MAIN SOUTHERN JOURNEY WE WERE SO MANY IN A TENT AND SPACE WAS SO LIMITED THAT I DARED NOT RISK USING IT IF ONE HAS ROOM ENOUGH IT IS IDEAL IN MY OPINION
2384-152900-0069 WE HAD WITH US TEN PAIRS OF SNOW SHOES AND ONE HUNDRED SETS OF DOG HARNESS OF THE ALASKA ESKIMO PATTERN THE ALASKA ESKIMO DRIVE THEIR DOGS IN TANDEM THE WHOLE PULL IS THUS STRAIGHT AHEAD IN THE DIRECTION THE SLEDGE IS GOING
2384-152900-0070 AND THIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE BEST WAY OF UTILIZING THE POWER I HAD MADE UP MY MIND TO ADOPT THE SAME SYSTEM IN SLEDGING ON THE BARRIER ANOTHER GREAT ADVANTAGE IT HAD WAS THAT THE DOGS WOULD PASS SINGLY ACROSS FISSURES
2384-152900-0071 SO THAT THE DANGER OF FALLING THROUGH WAS CONSIDERABLY REDUCED THE EXERTION OF PULLING IS ALSO LESS TRYING WITH ALASKA HARNESS THAN WITH THE GREENLAND KIND AS THE ALASKA HARNESS HAS A SHALLOW PADDED COLLAR
2384-152900-0072 WHICH IS SLIPPED OVER THE ANIMAL'S HEAD AND MAKES THE WEIGHT OF THE PULL COME ON HIS SHOULDERS WHEREAS THE GREENLAND HARNESS PRESSES ON HIS CHEST RAW PLACES WHICH OCCUR RATHER FREQUENTLY WITH THE GREENLAND HARNESS ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY AVOIDED WITH THE OTHER
2384-152900-0073 ALL THE SETS OF HARNESS WERE MADE IN THE NAVY WORKSHOPS AND AFTER THEIR LONG AND HARD USE THEY ARE AS GOOD AS EVER THERE COULD BE NO BETTER RECOMMENDATION THAN THIS OF INSTRUMENTS AND APPARATUS FOR THE SLEDGE JOURNEYS WE CARRIED TWO SEXTANTS
2384-152900-0074 THREE ARTIFICIAL HORIZONS OF WHICH TWO WERE GLASS HORIZONS WITH DARK GLASSES AND ONE A MERCURY HORIZON AND FOUR SPIRIT COMPASSES MADE IN CHRISTIANIA THEY WERE EXCELLENT LITTLE COMPASSES
2384-152900-0075 I HAD DRAWN THE MAKER'S ATTENTION TO THIS BEFOREHAND AND ASKED HIM TO USE AS PURE A SPIRIT AS POSSIBLE WHAT HIS OBJECT WAS I STILL DO NOT KNOW BUT THE SPIRIT HE EMPLOYED WAS HIGHLY DILUTE
2384-152900-0076 THE BEST PROOF OF THIS WAS THAT THE LIQUID IN OUR COMPASSES FROZE BEFORE THE SPIRITS IN A FLASK WE WERE NATURALLY INCONVENIENCED BY THIS BESIDES THESE WE HAD AN ORDINARY LITTLE POCKET COMPASS TWO PAIRS OF BINOCULARS ONE BY ZEISS AND THE OTHER BY GOERTZ
2384-152900-0077 AND SNOW GOGGLES FROM DOCTOR SCHANZ
2384-152900-0078 DURING THE WHOLE STAY ON THE BARRIER I MYSELF WORE A PAIR OF ORDINARY SPECTACLES WITH YELLOW GLASSES OF QUITE A LIGHT TINT
2384-152900-0079 HOW EXCELLENT THESE GLASSES ARE APPEARS CLEARLY ENOUGH FROM THE FACT THAT I NEVER HAD THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH OF SNOW BLINDNESS ON THE SOUTHERN JOURNEY
2384-152900-0080 IT WILL PERHAPS BE SUGGESTED THAT I AM LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO THIS AILMENT THAN OTHERS BUT I KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT SUCH IS NOT THE CASE I HAVE PREVIOUSLY HAD SEVERAL SEVERE ATTACKS OF SNOW BLINDNESS WE HAD TWO PHOTOGRAPHIC CAMERAS AN AIR THERMOMETER
2384-152900-0081 TWO ANEROIDS WITH ALTITUDE SCALE TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND FEET AND TWO HYPSOMETERS THE HYPSOMETER IS ONLY AN INSTRUMENT FOR DETERMINING THE BOILING POINT WHICH GIVES ONE THE HEIGHT ABOVE THE SEA THE METHOD IS BOTH SIMPLE AND RELIABLE
2384-152900-0082 THE MEDICAL STORES FOR SLEDGING WERE GIVEN BY A LONDON FIRM AND THE WAY IN WHICH THE THINGS WERE PACKED SPEAKS FOR THE WHOLE OUTFIT THERE IS NOT A SPECK OF RUST ON NEEDLES SCISSORS KNIVES OR ANYTHING ELSE ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO MUCH DAMP
2384-152900-0083 OUR OWN MEDICAL OUTFIT WHICH WAS BOUGHT IN CHRISTIANIA AND ACCORDING TO THE VENDOR'S STATEMENT UNUSUALLY WELL PACKED BECAME IN A SHORT TIME SO DAMAGED THAT THE WHOLE OF IT IS NOW ENTIRELY SPOILT THE SLEDGING PROVISIONS MUST BE MENTIONED BRIEFLY
2384-152900-0084 I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN OF THE PEMMICAN I HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO TAKE A WHOLE GROCER'S SHOP WITH ME WHEN SLEDGING THE FOOD SHOULD BE SIMPLE AND NOURISHING AND THAT IS ENOUGH A RICH AND VARIED MENU IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO WORK TO DO
2384-152900-0085 BESIDES THE PEMMICAN WE HAD BISCUITS MILK POWDER AND CHOCOLATE THE BISCUITS WERE A PRESENT FROM A WELL KNOWN NORWEGIAN FACTORY AND DID ALL HONOUR TO THEIR ORIGIN THEY WERE SPECIALLY BAKED FOR US AND WERE MADE OF OATMEAL WITH THE ADDITION OF DRIED MILK AND A LITTLE SUGAR
2384-152900-0086 THEY WERE EXTREMELY NOURISHING AND PLEASANT TO THE TASTE THANKS TO EFFICIENT PACKING THEY KEPT FRESH AND CRISP ALL THE TIME THESE BISCUITS FORMED A GREAT PART OF OUR DAILY DIET AND UNDOUBTEDLY CONTRIBUTED IN NO SMALL DEGREE TO THE SUCCESSFUL RESULT
2384-152900-0087 MILK POWDER IS A COMPARATIVELY NEW COMMODITY WITH US BUT IT DESERVES TO BE BETTER KNOWN IT CAME FROM THE DISTRICT OF JAEDEREN NEITHER HEAT NOR COLD DRYNESS NOR WET COULD HURT IT
2384-152900-0088 WE HAD LARGE QUANTITIES OF IT LYING OUT IN SMALL THIN LINEN BAGS IN EVERY POSSIBLE STATE OF THE WEATHER THE POWDER WAS AS GOOD THE LAST DAY AS THE FIRST WE ALSO TOOK DRIED MILK FROM A FIRM IN WISCONSIN THIS MILK HAD AN ADDITION OF MALT AND SUGAR
2384-152900-0089 AND WAS IN MY OPINION EXCELLENT IT ALSO KEPT GOOD THE WHOLE TIME THE CHOCOLATE CAME FROM A WORLD RENOWNED FIRM AND WAS BEYOND ALL PRAISE THE WHOLE SUPPLY WAS A VERY ACCEPTABLE GIFT
2391-145015-0000 STEVENTON IS A SMALL RURAL VILLAGE UPON THE CHALK HILLS OF NORTH HANTS SITUATED IN A WINDING VALLEY ABOUT SEVEN MILES FROM BASINGSTOKE THE SOUTH WESTERN RAILWAY CROSSES IT BY A SHORT EMBANKMENT
2391-145015-0001 AND AS IT CURVES ROUND PRESENTS A GOOD VIEW OF IT ON THE LEFT HAND TO THOSE WHO ARE TRAVELLING DOWN THE LINE ABOUT THREE MILES BEFORE ENTERING THE TUNNEL UNDER POPHAM BEACON IT MAY BE KNOWN TO SOME SPORTSMEN AS LYING IN ONE OF THE BEST PORTIONS OF THE VINE HUNT
2391-145015-0002 IT IS CERTAINLY NOT A PICTURESQUE COUNTRY IT PRESENTS NO GRAND OR EXTENSIVE VIEWS BUT THE FEATURES ARE SMALL RATHER THAN PLAIN THE SURFACE CONTINUALLY SWELLS AND SINKS BUT THE HILLS ARE NOT BOLD NOR THE VALLEYS DEEP
2391-145015-0003 AND THOUGH IT IS SUFFICIENTLY WELL CLOTHED WITH WOODS AND HEDGEROWS YET THE POVERTY OF THE SOIL IN MOST PLACES PREVENTS THE TIMBER FROM ATTAINING A LARGE SIZE STILL IT HAS ITS BEAUTIES THE LANES WIND ALONG IN A NATURAL CURVE
2391-145015-0004 CONTINUALLY FRINGED WITH IRREGULAR BORDERS OF NATIVE TURF AND LEAD TO PLEASANT NOOKS AND CORNERS ONE WHO KNEW AND LOVED IT WELL VERY HAPPILY EXPRESSED ITS QUIET CHARMS WHEN HE WROTE TRUE TASTE IS NOT FASTIDIOUS
2391-145015-0005 NOR REJECTS BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT COME WITHIN THE RULE OF COMPOSITION PURE AND PICTURESQUE UNNUMBERED SIMPLE SCENES WHICH FILL THE LEAVES OF NATURE'S SKETCH BOOK OF THIS SOMEWHAT TAME COUNTRY STEVENTON FROM THE FALL OF THE GROUND AND THE ABUNDANCE OF ITS TIMBER
2391-145015-0006 IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE PRETTIEST SPOTS
2391-145015-0007 COMPARED WITH THE BROAD RIVER THE RICH VALLEY AND THE NOBLE HILLS WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO BEHOLD AT HER NATIVE HOME NEAR HENLEY UPON THAMES THE HOUSE ITSELF STOOD IN A SHALLOW VALLEY SURROUNDED BY SLOPING MEADOWS WELL SPRINKLED WITH ELM TREES AT THE END OF A SMALL VILLAGE OF COTTAGES
2391-145015-0008 EACH WELL PROVIDED WITH A GARDEN SCATTERED ABOUT PRETTILY ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY COMMODIOUS TO HOLD PUPILS IN ADDITION TO A GROWING FAMILY AND WAS IN THOSE TIMES CONSIDERED TO BE ABOVE THE AVERAGE OF PARSONAGES
2391-145015-0009 NO CORNICE MARKED THE JUNCTION OF WALL AND CEILING WHILE THE BEAMS WHICH SUPPORTED THE UPPER FLOORS PROJECTED INTO THE ROOMS BELOW IN ALL THEIR NAKED SIMPLICITY COVERED ONLY BY A COAT OF PAINT OR WHITEWASH
2391-145015-0010 AND ABOUT FORTY FIVE YEARS AGO IT WAS PULLED DOWN FOR THE PURPOSE OF ERECTING A NEW HOUSE IN A FAR BETTER SITUATION ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE VALLEY
2391-145015-0011 ON THE SOUTH SIDE THE GROUND ROSE GENTLY AND WAS OCCUPIED BY ONE OF THOSE OLD FASHIONED GARDENS IN WHICH VEGETABLES AND FLOWERS ARE COMBINED FLANKED AND PROTECTED ON THE EAST BY ONE OF THE THATCHED MUD WALLS COMMON IN THAT COUNTRY AND OVERSHADOWED BY FINE ELMS
2391-145015-0012 ALONG THE UPPER OR SOUTHERN SIDE OF THIS GARDEN RAN A TERRACE OF THE FINEST TURF
2391-145015-0013 BUT THE CHIEF BEAUTY OF STEVENTON CONSISTED IN ITS HEDGEROWS A HEDGEROW IN THAT COUNTRY DOES NOT MEAN A THIN FORMAL LINE OF QUICKSET BUT AN IRREGULAR BORDER OF COPSE WOOD AND TIMBER OFTEN WIDE ENOUGH TO CONTAIN WITHIN IT A WINDING FOOTPATH OR A ROUGH CART TRACK
2391-145015-0014 AND NOW AND THEN THE UNWELCOME ADDER TWO SUCH HEDGEROWS RADIATED AS IT WERE FROM THE PARSONAGE GARDEN ONE A CONTINUATION OF THE TURF TERRACE PROCEEDED WESTWARD FORMING THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE HOME MEADOWS
2391-145015-0015 AND WAS FORMED INTO A RUSTIC SHRUBBERY WITH OCCASIONAL SEATS ENTITLED THE WOOD WALK THE OTHER RAN STRAIGHT UP THE HILL UNDER THE NAME OF THE CHURCH WALK BECAUSE IT LED TO THE PARISH CHURCH
2391-145015-0016 WHO HAVE FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY RENTED IT TOGETHER WITH THE CHIEF FARM IN THE PARISH THE CHURCH ITSELF I SPEAK OF IT AS IT THEN WAS BEFORE THE IMPROVEMENTS MADE BY THE PRESENT RECTOR
2391-145015-0017 MIGHT HAVE APPEARED MEAN AND UNINTERESTING TO AN ORDINARY OBSERVER BUT THE ADEPT IN CHURCH ARCHITECTURE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT IT MUST HAVE STOOD THERE SOME SEVEN CENTURIES AND WOULD HAVE FOUND BEAUTY IN THE VERY NARROW EARLY ENGLISH WINDOWS
2391-145015-0018 WHILE ITS SOLITARY POSITION FAR FROM THE HUM OF THE VILLAGE AND WITHIN SIGHT OF NO HABITATION EXCEPT A GLIMPSE OF THE GRAY MANOR HOUSE THROUGH ITS CIRCLING SCREEN OF SYCAMORES HAS IN IT SOMETHING SOLEMN AND APPROPRIATE TO THE LAST RESTING PLACE OF THE SILENT DEAD
2391-145015-0019 SWEET VIOLETS BOTH PURPLE AND WHITE GROW IN ABUNDANCE BENEATH ITS SOUTH WALL ONE MAY IMAGINE FOR HOW MANY CENTURIES THE ANCESTORS OF THOSE LITTLE FLOWERS HAVE OCCUPIED THAT UNDISTURBED SUNNY NOOK
2391-145015-0020 THICK COMING FANCIES ROSE IN HER MIND AND GRADUALLY ASSUMED THE FORMS IN WHICH THEY CAME FORTH TO THE WORLD
2391-145015-0021 THE FAMILY WAS UNBROKEN BY DEATH AND SELDOM VISITED BY SORROW THEIR SITUATION HAD SOME PECULIAR ADVANTAGES BEYOND THOSE OF ORDINARY RECTORIES STEVENTON WAS A FAMILY LIVING MISTER KNIGHT THE PATRON WAS ALSO PROPRIETOR OF NEARLY THE WHOLE PARISH
2391-145015-0022 THEY SHARED WITH THE PRINCIPAL TENANT THE COMMAND OF AN EXCELLENT MANOR AND ENJOYED IN THIS REFLECTED WAY SOME OF THE CONSIDERATION USUALLY AWARDED TO LANDED PROPRIETORS
2391-145015-0023 THEY HAD ENOUGH TO AFFORD A GOOD EDUCATION TO THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS TO MIX IN THE BEST SOCIETY OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND TO EXERCISE A LIBERAL HOSPITALITY TO THEIR OWN RELATIONS AND FRIENDS A CARRIAGE AND A PAIR OF HORSES WERE KEPT
2391-145015-0024 THIS MIGHT IMPLY A HIGHER STYLE OF LIVING IN OUR DAYS THAN IT DID IN THEIRS THERE WERE THEN NO ASSESSED TAXES THE CARRIAGE ONCE BOUGHT ENTAILED LITTLE FURTHER EXPENSE AND THE HORSES PROBABLY LIKE MISTER BENNET'S WERE OFTEN EMPLOYED ON FARM WORK
2391-145015-0025 MOREOVER IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT A PAIR OF HORSES IN THOSE DAYS WERE ALMOST NECESSARY IF LADIES WERE TO MOVE ABOUT AT ALL
2391-145015-0026 WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THE FEW SPECIMENS STILL REMAINING OF COACH BUILDING IN THE LAST CENTURY IT STRIKES ONE THAT THE CHIEF OBJECT OF THE BUILDERS MUST HAVE BEEN TO COMBINE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE WEIGHT WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF ACCOMMODATION
2391-145015-0027 THE FAMILY LIVED IN CLOSE INTIMACY WITH TWO COUSINS EDWARD AND JANE COOPER THE CHILDREN OF MISSUS AUSTEN'S ELDEST SISTER AND DOCTOR COOPER THE VICAR OF SONNING NEAR READING THE COOPERS LIVED FOR SOME YEARS AT BATH
2391-145015-0028 I BELIEVE THAT CASSANDRA AND JANE SOMETIMES VISITED THEM THERE AND THAT JANE THUS ACQUIRED THE INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TOPOGRAPHY AND CUSTOMS OF BATH WHICH ENABLED HER TO WRITE NORTHANGER ABBEY LONG BEFORE SHE RESIDED THERE HERSELF
2391-145015-0029 AFTER THE DEATH OF THEIR OWN PARENTS THE TWO YOUNG COOPERS PAID LONG VISITS AT STEVENTON EDWARD COOPER DID NOT LIVE UNDISTINGUISHED
2391-145015-0030 AND IN LATER LIFE HE WAS KNOWN BY A WORK ON PROPHECY CALLED THE CRISIS AND OTHER RELIGIOUS PUBLICATIONS ESPECIALLY FOR SEVERAL VOLUMES OF SERMONS MUCH PREACHED IN MANY PULPITS IN MY YOUTH
2391-145015-0031 JANE COOPER WAS MARRIED FROM HER UNCLE'S HOUSE AT STEVENTON TO CAPTAIN AFTERWARDS SIR THOMAS WILLIAMS UNDER WHOM CHARLES AUSTEN SERVED IN SEVERAL SHIPS SHE WAS A DEAR FRIEND OF HER NAMESAKE
2391-145015-0032 BUT WAS FATED TO BECOME A CAUSE OF GREAT SORROW TO HER FOR A FEW YEARS AFTER THE MARRIAGE SHE WAS SUDDENLY KILLED BY AN ACCIDENT TO HER CARRIAGE THERE WAS ANOTHER COUSIN CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AT STEVENTON
2391-145015-0033 WHO MUST HAVE INTRODUCED GREATER VARIETY INTO THE FAMILY CIRCLE THIS WAS THE DAUGHTER OF MISTER AUSTEN'S ONLY SISTER MISSUS HANCOCK
2391-145015-0034 OF WHOM I KNOW LITTLE MORE THAN THAT HE PERISHED BY THE GUILLOTINE DURING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION PERHAPS HIS CHIEF OFFENCE WAS HIS RANK BUT IT WAS SAID THAT THE CHARGE OF INCIVISM UNDER WHICH HE SUFFERED RESTED ON THE FACT OF HIS HAVING LAID DOWN SOME ARABLE LAND INTO PASTURE
2391-145015-0035 HIS WIFE ESCAPED THROUGH DANGERS AND DIFFICULTIES TO ENGLAND WAS RECEIVED FOR SOME TIME INTO HER UNCLE'S FAMILY AND FINALLY MARRIED HER COUSIN HENRY AUSTEN
2391-145015-0036 SHE AND HER SECOND HUSBAND WENT TO FRANCE IN THE HOPE OF RECOVERING SOME OF THE COUNT'S PROPERTY AND THERE NARROWLY ESCAPED BEING INCLUDED AMONGST THE DETENUS ORDERS HAD BEEN GIVEN BY BUONAPARTE'S GOVERNMENT TO DETAIN ALL ENGLISH TRAVELLERS
2391-145015-0037 BUT AT THE POST HOUSES MISSUS HENRY AUSTEN GAVE THE NECESSARY ORDERS HERSELF AND HER FRENCH WAS SO PERFECT THAT SHE PASSED EVERYWHERE FOR A NATIVE
2391-145015-0038 SHE WAS A CLEVER WOMAN AND HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED AFTER THE FRENCH RATHER THAN THE ENGLISH MODE AND IN THOSE DAYS WHEN INTERCOURSE WITH THE CONTINENT WAS LONG INTERRUPTED BY WAR SUCH AN ELEMENT IN THE SOCIETY OF A COUNTRY PARSONAGE MUST HAVE BEEN A RARE ACQUISITION
2391-145015-0039 THE SISTERS MAY HAVE BEEN MORE INDEBTED TO THIS COUSIN THAN TO MISSUS LA TOURNELLE'S TEACHING FOR THE CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE OF FRENCH WHICH THEY POSSESSED SHE ALSO TOOK THE PRINCIPAL PARTS IN THE PRIVATE THEATRICALS IN WHICH THE FAMILY SEVERAL TIMES INDULGED
2391-145015-0040 HAVING THEIR SUMMER THEATRE IN THE BARN AND THEIR WINTER ONE WITHIN THE NARROW LIMITS OF THE DINING ROOM WHERE THE NUMBER OF THE AUDIENCE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY LIMITED ON THESE OCCASIONS THE PROLOGUES AND EPILOGUES WERE WRITTEN BY JANE'S ELDEST BROTHER
2391-145015-0041 AND SOME OF THEM ARE VERY VIGOROUS AND AMUSING JANE WAS ONLY TWELVE YEARS OLD AT THE TIME OF THE EARLIEST OF THESE REPRESENTATIONS AND NOT MORE THAN FIFTEEN WHEN THE LAST TOOK PLACE SHE WAS HOWEVER AN EARLY OBSERVER
2391-145015-0042 AND IT MAY BE REASONABLY SUPPOSED THAT SOME OF THE INCIDENTS AND FEELINGS WHICH ARE SO VIVIDLY PAINTED IN THE MANSFIELD PARK THEATRICALS ARE DUE TO HER RECOLLECTIONS OF THESE ENTERTAINMENTS SOME TIME BEFORE THEY LEFT STEVENTON ONE GREAT AFFLICTION CAME UPON THE FAMILY
2391-145015-0043 HE ACCOMPANIED THIS FRIEND TO THE WEST INDIES AS CHAPLAIN TO HIS REGIMENT AND THERE DIED OF YELLOW FEVER TO THE GREAT CONCERN OF HIS FRIEND AND PATRON WHO AFTERWARDS DECLARED THAT IF HE HAD KNOWN OF THE ENGAGEMENT HE WOULD NOT HAVE PERMITTED HIM TO GO OUT TO SUCH A CLIMATE
2391-145015-0044 THIS LITTLE DOMESTIC TRAGEDY CAUSED GREAT AND LASTING GRIEF TO THE PRINCIPAL SUFFERER AND COULD NOT BUT CAST A GLOOM OVER THE WHOLE PARTY THE SYMPATHY OF JANE WAS PROBABLY FROM HER AGE AND HER PECULIAR ATTACHMENT TO HER SISTER
2391-145015-0045 HER REVIEWER IN THE QUARTERLY OF JANUARY EIGHTEEN TWENTY ONE OBSERVES CONCERNING THE ATTACHMENT OF FANNY PRICE TO EDMUND BERTRAM THE SILENCE IN WHICH THIS PASSION IS CHERISHED THE SLENDER HOPES AND ENJOYMENTS BY WHICH IT IS FED
2391-145015-0046 THE RESTLESSNESS AND JEALOUSY WITH WHICH IT FILLS A MIND NATURALLY ACTIVE CONTENTED AND UNSUSPICIOUS THE MANNER IN WHICH IT TINGES EVERY EVENT AND EVERY REFLECTION ARE PAINTED WITH A VIVIDNESS AND A DETAIL OF WHICH WE CAN SCARCELY CONCEIVE ANY ONE BUT A FEMALE
2391-145015-0047 AND WE SHOULD ALMOST ADD A FEMALE WRITING FROM RECOLLECTION CAPABLE THIS CONJECTURE HOWEVER PROBABLE WAS WIDE OF THE MARK THE PICTURE WAS DRAWN FROM THE INTUITIVE PERCEPTIONS OF GENIUS NOT FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
2391-145015-0048 IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE OF HER LIFE WAS THERE ANY SIMILARITY BETWEEN HERSELF AND HER HEROINE IN MANSFIELD PARK
2391-145015-0049 IN HER YOUTH SHE HAD DECLINED THE ADDRESSES OF A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF GOOD CHARACTER AND CONNECTIONS AND POSITION IN LIFE OF EVERYTHING IN FACT EXCEPT THE SUBTLE POWER OF TOUCHING HER HEART
2391-145015-0050 THERE IS HOWEVER ONE PASSAGE OF ROMANCE IN HER HISTORY WITH WHICH I AM IMPERFECTLY ACQUAINTED AND TO WHICH I AM UNABLE TO ASSIGN NAME OR DATE OR PLACE THOUGH I HAVE IT ON SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY
2391-145015-0051 MANY YEARS AFTER HER DEATH SOME CIRCUMSTANCES INDUCED HER SISTER CASSANDRA TO BREAK THROUGH HER HABITUAL RETICENCE AND TO SPEAK OF IT
2391-145015-0052 WHOSE CHARM OF PERSON MIND AND MANNERS WAS SUCH THAT CASSANDRA THOUGHT HIM WORTHY TO POSSESS AND LIKELY TO WIN HER SISTER'S LOVE WHEN THEY PARTED
2391-145015-0053 AND CASSANDRA FELT NO DOUBT AS TO HIS MOTIVES BUT THEY NEVER AGAIN MET WITHIN A SHORT TIME THEY HEARD OF HIS SUDDEN DEATH I BELIEVE THAT IF JANE EVER LOVED IT WAS THIS UNNAMED GENTLEMAN BUT THE ACQUAINTANCE HAD BEEN SHORT
2391-145015-0054 ANY DESCRIPTION THAT I MIGHT ATTEMPT OF THE FAMILY LIFE AT STEVENTON WHICH CLOSED SOON AFTER I WAS BORN COULD BE LITTLE BETTER THAN A FANCY PIECE
2391-145015-0055 WOULD SEEM STRANGE TO US AND SHOULD MISS MANY MORE TO WHICH WE ARE ACCUSTOMED EVERY HUNDRED YEARS AND ESPECIALLY A CENTURY LIKE THE LAST MARKED BY AN EXTRAORDINARY ADVANCE IN WEALTH LUXURY AND REFINEMENT OF TASTE AS WELL AS IN THE MECHANICAL ARTS WHICH EMBELLISH OUR HOUSES
2391-145015-0056 MUST PRODUCE A GREAT CHANGE IN THEIR ASPECT THESE CHANGES ARE ALWAYS AT WORK THEY ARE GOING ON NOW BUT SO SILENTLY THAT WE TAKE NO NOTE OF THEM MEN SOON FORGET THE SMALL OBJECTS WHICH THEY LEAVE BEHIND THEM AS THEY DRIFT DOWN THE STREAM OF LIFE
2391-145015-0057 AS POPE SAYS NOR DOES LIFE'S STREAM FOR OBSERVATION STAY IT HURRIES ALL TOO FAST TO MARK THEIR WAY IMPORTANT INVENTIONS SUCH AS THE APPLICATIONS OF STEAM GAS AND ELECTRICITY MAY FIND THEIR PLACES IN HISTORY
2391-145015-0058 WHO CAN NOW RECORD THE DEGREES BY WHICH THE CUSTOM PREVALENT IN MY YOUTH OF ASKING EACH OTHER TO TAKE WINE TOGETHER AT DINNER BECAME OBSOLETE WHO WILL BE ABLE TO FIX TWENTY YEARS HENCE THE DATE WHEN OUR DINNERS BEGAN TO BE CARVED AND HANDED ROUND BY SERVANTS
2391-145015-0059 INSTEAD OF SMOKING BEFORE OUR EYES AND NOSES ON THE TABLE TO RECORD SUCH LITTLE MATTERS WOULD INDEED BE TO CHRONICLE SMALL BEER
2391-145015-0060 BUT WHICH THE HISTORIAN HAS THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN RECOVERING AT THAT TIME THE DINNER TABLE PRESENTED A FAR LESS SPLENDID APPEARANCE THAN IT DOES NOW IT WAS APPROPRIATED TO SOLID FOOD RATHER THAN TO FLOWERS FRUITS AND DECORATIONS
2391-145015-0061 NOR WAS THERE MUCH GLITTER OF PLATE UPON IT FOR THE EARLY DINNER HOUR RENDERED CANDLESTICKS UNNECESSARY
2391-145015-0062 THOUGH NOT LESS PLENTIFUL AND SAVOURY AND THE BILL OF FARE IN ONE HOUSE WOULD NOT BE SO LIKE THAT IN ANOTHER AS IT IS NOW FOR FAMILY RECEIPTS WERE HELD IN HIGH ESTIMATION
2391-145015-0063 AND MIGHT INFLUENCE THE FAMILY DINNER FOR MANY GENERATIONS
2391-145015-0064 ONE HOUSE WOULD PRIDE ITSELF ON ITS HAM ANOTHER ON ITS GAME PIE AND A THIRD ON ITS SUPERIOR FURMITY OR TANSEY PUDDING BEER AND HOME MADE WINES ESPECIALLY MEAD WERE MORE LARGELY CONSUMED VEGETABLES WERE LESS PLENTIFUL AND LESS VARIOUS
2391-145015-0065 POTATOES WERE USED BUT NOT SO ABUNDANTLY AS NOW AND THERE WAS AN IDEA THAT THEY WERE TO BE EATEN ONLY WITH ROAST MEAT THEY WERE NOVELTIES TO A TENANT'S WIFE WHO WAS ENTERTAINED AT STEVENTON PARSONAGE CERTAINLY LESS THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO
2391-145015-0066 AND WHEN MISSUS AUSTEN ADVISED HER TO PLANT THEM IN HER OWN GARDEN SHE REPLIED NO NO THEY ARE VERY WELL FOR YOU GENTRY BUT THEY MUST BE TERRIBLY COSTLY TO REAR BUT A STILL GREATER DIFFERENCE WOULD BE FOUND IN THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOMS
2391-145015-0067 WHICH WOULD APPEAR TO US LAMENTABLY SCANTY THERE WAS A GENERAL DEFICIENCY OF CARPETING IN SITTING ROOMS BED ROOMS AND PASSAGES A PIANOFORTE OR RATHER A SPINNET OR HARPSICHORD WAS BY NO MEANS A NECESSARY APPENDAGE
2391-145015-0068 IT WAS TO BE FOUND ONLY WHERE THERE WAS A DECIDED TASTE FOR MUSIC NOT SO COMMON THEN AS NOW OR IN SUCH GREAT HOUSES AS WOULD PROBABLY CONTAIN A BILLIARD TABLE THERE WOULD OFTEN BE BUT ONE SOFA IN THE HOUSE AND THAT A STIFF ANGULAR
2391-145015-0069 UNCOMFORTABLE ARTICLE THERE WERE NO DEEP EASY CHAIRS NOR OTHER APPLIANCES FOR LOUNGING FOR TO LIE DOWN OR EVEN TO LEAN BACK WAS A LUXURY PERMITTED ONLY TO OLD PERSONS OR INVALIDS
2391-145015-0070 AND A MODEL GENTLEMAN OF HIS DAY THAT HE WOULD HAVE MADE THE TOUR OF EUROPE WITHOUT EVER TOUCHING THE BACK OF HIS TRAVELLING CARRIAGE BUT PERHAPS WE SHOULD BE MOST STRUCK WITH THE TOTAL ABSENCE OF THOSE ELEGANT LITTLE ARTICLES WHICH NOW EMBELLISH AND ENCUMBER OUR DRAWING ROOM TABLES
2391-145015-0071 WE SHOULD MISS THE SLIDING BOOKCASES AND PICTURE STANDS
2391-145015-0072 THE PERIODICALS AND ILLUSTRATED NEWSPAPERS ABOVE ALL
2391-145015-0073 A SMALL WRITING DESK WITH A SMALLER WORK BOX OR NETTING CASE WAS ALL THAT EACH YOUNG LADY CONTRIBUTED TO OCCUPY THE TABLE FOR THE LARGE FAMILY WORK BASKET THOUGH OFTEN PRODUCED IN THE PARLOUR LIVED IN THE CLOSET
2391-145015-0074 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MORE DANCING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN THOSE DAYS THAN THERE IS NOW
2391-145015-0075 AS IF IT WERE A NATURAL PRODUCTION WITH LESS FASTIDIOUSNESS AS TO THE QUALITY OF MUSIC LIGHTS AND FLOOR MANY COUNTRY TOWNS HAD A MONTHLY BALL THROUGHOUT THE WINTER IN SOME OF WHICH THE SAME APARTMENT SERVED FOR DANCING AND TEA ROOM
2391-145015-0076 TO THE MUSIC OF A HARPSICHORD IN THE HOUSE OR A FIDDLE FROM THE VILLAGE THIS WAS ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE
2391-145015-0077 FOR SHE ATTRIBUTES THIS TASTE TO HER FAVOURITE HEROINES
2391-145015-0078 AND MADE OF IMPORTANCE MANY THINGS CONNECTED WITH THE BALL ROOMS OF THOSE DAYS HAVE NOW PASSED INTO OBLIVION THE BARBAROUS LAW WHICH CONFINED THE LADY TO ONE PARTNER THROUGHOUT THE EVENING MUST INDEED HAVE BEEN ABOLISHED BEFORE JANE WENT TO BALLS
2391-145015-0079 IT MUST BE OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT THIS CUSTOM WAS IN ONE RESPECT ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE GENTLEMAN INASMUCH AS IT RENDERED HIS DUTIES MORE PRACTICABLE HE WAS BOUND TO CALL UPON HIS PARTNER THE NEXT MORNING
2391-145015-0080 TO GALLOP ALL THE COUNTRY OVER THE LAST NIGHT'S PARTNER TO BEHOLD AND HUMBLY HOPE SHE CAUGHT NO COLD BUT THE STATELY MINUET STILL REIGNED SUPREME AND EVERY REGULAR BALL COMMENCED WITH IT IT WAS A SLOW AND SOLEMN MOVEMENT
2391-145015-0081 EXPRESSIVE OF GRACE AND DIGNITY RATHER THAN OF MERRIMENT IT ABOUNDED IN FORMAL BOWS AND COURTESIES WITH MEASURED PACES FORWARDS BACKWARDS AND SIDEWAYS AND MANY COMPLICATED GYRATIONS
2391-145015-0082 IT WAS EXECUTED BY ONE LADY AND GENTLEMAN AMIDST THE ADMIRATION OR THE CRITICISM OF SURROUNDING SPECTATORS IN ITS EARLIER AND MOST PALMY DAYS AS WHEN SIR CHARLES AND LADY GRANDISON DELIGHTED THE COMPANY BY DANCING IT AT THEIR OWN WEDDING
2391-145015-0083 THE GENTLEMAN WORE A DRESS SWORD AND THE LADY WAS ARMED WITH A FAN OF NEARLY EQUAL DIMENSIONS ADDISON OBSERVES THAT WOMEN ARE ARMED WITH FANS AS MEN WITH SWORDS AND SOMETIMES DO MORE EXECUTION WITH THEM
2391-145015-0084 THE GRACEFUL CARRIAGE OF EACH WEAPON WAS CONSIDERED A TEST OF HIGH BREEDING THE CLOWNISH MAN WAS IN DANGER OF BEING TRIPPED UP BY HIS SWORD GETTING BETWEEN HIS LEGS
2391-145015-0085 AND I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THOSE LADIES WHO INTENDED TO DANCE MINUETS USED TO DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES FROM OTHERS BY WEARING A PARTICULAR KIND OF LAPPET ON THEIR HEAD DRESS I HAVE HEARD ALSO OF ANOTHER CURIOUS PROOF OF THE RESPECT IN WHICH THIS DANCE WAS HELD
2391-145015-0086 GLOVES IMMACULATELY CLEAN WERE CONSIDERED REQUISITE FOR ITS DUE PERFORMANCE WHILE GLOVES A LITTLE SOILED WERE THOUGHT GOOD ENOUGH FOR A COUNTRY DANCE AND ACCORDINGLY SOME PRUDENT LADIES PROVIDED THEMSELVES WITH TWO PAIRS FOR THEIR SEVERAL PURPOSES
2391-145015-0087 THE MINUET EXPIRED WITH THE LAST CENTURY BUT LONG AFTER IT HAD CEASED TO BE DANCED PUBLICLY IT WAS TAUGHT TO BOYS AND GIRLS IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM A GRACEFUL CARRIAGE HORNPIPES COTILLONS AND REELS WERE OCCASIONALLY DANCED
2391-145015-0088 BUT THE CHIEF OCCUPATION OF THE EVENING WAS THE INTERMINABLE COUNTRY DANCE IN WHICH ALL COULD JOIN THIS DANCE PRESENTED A GREAT SHOW OF ENJOYMENT BUT IT WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS PECULIAR TROUBLES
2391-145015-0089 THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WERE RANGED APART FROM EACH OTHER IN OPPOSITE ROWS SO THAT THE FACILITIES FOR FLIRTATION OR INTERESTING INTERCOURSE WERE NOT SO GREAT AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN DESIRED BY BOTH PARTIES MUCH HEART BURNING AND DISCONTENT SOMETIMES AROSE AS TO WHO SHOULD STAND ABOVE WHOM
2391-145015-0090 AND ESPECIALLY AS TO WHO WAS ENTITLED TO THE HIGH PRIVILEGE OF CALLING AND LEADING OFF THE FIRST DANCE AND NO LITTLE INDIGNATION WAS FELT AT THE LOWER END OF THE ROOM WHEN ANY OF THE LEADING COUPLES RETIRED PREMATURELY FROM THEIR DUTIES AND DID NOT CONDESCEND TO DANCE UP AND DOWN THE WHOLE SET
2391-145015-0091 WE MAY REJOICE THAT THESE CAUSES OF IRRITATION NO LONGER EXIST AND THAT IF SUCH FEELINGS AS JEALOUSY RIVALRY AND DISCONTENT EVER TOUCH CELESTIAL BOSOMS IN THE MODERN BALL ROOM THEY MUST ARISE FROM DIFFERENT AND MORE RECONDITE SOURCES
2391-145015-0092 I AM TEMPTED TO ADD A LITTLE ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE OF PERSONAL HABITS IT MAY BE ASSERTED AS A GENERAL TRUTH THAT LESS WAS LEFT TO THE CHARGE AND DISCRETION OF SERVANTS AND MORE WAS DONE OR SUPERINTENDED BY THE MASTERS AND MISTRESSES
2391-145015-0093 WITH REGARD TO THE MISTRESSES IT IS I BELIEVE GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT AT THE TIME TO WHICH I REFER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THEY TOOK A PERSONAL PART IN THE HIGHER BRANCHES OF COOKERY AS WELL AS IN THE CONCOCTION OF HOME MADE WINES
2391-145015-0094 AND DISTILLING OF HERBS FOR DOMESTIC MEDICINES WHICH ARE NEARLY ALLIED TO THE SAME ART LADIES DID NOT DISDAIN TO SPIN THE THREAD OF WHICH THE HOUSEHOLD LINEN WAS WOVEN SOME LADIES LIKED TO WASH WITH THEIR OWN HANDS THEIR CHOICE CHINA AFTER BREAKFAST OR TEA
2391-145015-0095 AS THAT THEY TOOK AN INTEREST IN SUCH OCCUPATIONS AND IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND HOW MANY SOURCES OF INTEREST ENJOYED BY THIS GENERATION WERE THEN CLOSED OR VERY SCANTILY OPENED TO LADIES A VERY SMALL MINORITY OF THEM CARED MUCH FOR LITERATURE OR SCIENCE
2391-145015-0096 BUT I DOUBT WHETHER THE RISING GENERATION ARE EQUALLY AWARE HOW MUCH GENTLEMEN ALSO DID FOR THEMSELVES IN THOSE TIMES
2391-145015-0097 THAN THEY ARE NOW MASTER'S EYE MAKES THE HORSE FAT AND IF YOU WOULD BE WELL SERVED SERVE YOURSELF SOME GENTLEMEN TOOK PLEASURE IN BEING THEIR OWN GARDENERS PERFORMING ALL THE SCIENTIFIC AND SOME OF THE MANUAL WORK THEMSELVES
2391-145015-0098 WELL DRESSED YOUNG MEN OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD THEIR COAT FROM A LONDON TAILOR WOULD ALWAYS BRUSH THEIR EVENING SUIT THEMSELVES RATHER THAN ENTRUST IT TO THE CARELESSNESS OF A ROUGH SERVANT AND TO THE RISKS OF DIRT AND GREASE IN THE KITCHEN
2391-145015-0099 FOR IN THOSE DAYS SERVANTS HALLS WERE NOT COMMON IN THE HOUSES OF THE CLERGY AND THE SMALLER COUNTRY GENTRY IT WAS QUITE NATURAL THAT CATHERINE MORLAND SHOULD HAVE CONTRASTED THE MAGNIFICENCE OF THE OFFICES AT NORTHANGER ABBEY WITH THE FEW SHAPELESS PANTRIES IN HER FATHER'S PARSONAGE
2391-145015-0100 A YOUNG MAN WHO EXPECTED TO HAVE HIS THINGS PACKED OR UNPACKED FOR HIM BY A SERVANT WHEN HE TRAVELLED
2391-145015-0101 IT WAS THOUGHT MERITORIOUS ON THE EVENING OF A HUNTING DAY TO TURN OUT AFTER DINNER LANTHORN IN HAND AND VISIT THE STABLE TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE HORSE HAD BEEN WELL CARED FOR THIS WAS OF THE MORE IMPORTANCE BECAUSE PREVIOUS TO THE INTRODUCTION OF CLIPPING ABOUT THE YEAR EIGHTEEN TWENTY
2391-145015-0102 IT WAS A DIFFICULT AND TEDIOUS WORK TO MAKE A LONG COATED HUNTER DRY AND COMFORTABLE AND WAS OFTEN VERY IMPERFECTLY DONE OF COURSE SUCH THINGS WERE NOT PRACTISED BY THOSE WHO HAD GAMEKEEPERS AND STUD GROOMS AND PLENTY OF WELL TRAINED SERVANTS
2391-145015-0103 BUT THEY WERE PRACTISED BY MANY WHO WERE UNEQUIVOCALLY GENTLEMEN AND WHOSE GRANDSONS OCCUPYING THE SAME POSITION IN LIFE MAY PERHAPS BE ASTONISHED AT BEING TOLD THAT SUCH THINGS WERE
2391-145015-0104 OF COURSE THEY CANNOT BE UNIVERSALLY APPLICABLE SUCH DETAILS VARIED IN VARIOUS CIRCLES AND WERE CHANGED VERY GRADUALLY
2391-145015-0105 BUT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THEIR WAY OF LIFE DIFFERED A LITTLE FROM OURS
2391-145015-0106 IT MAY BE THAT USEFUL ARTICLES WHICH WOULD NOT NOW BE PRODUCED IN DRAWING ROOMS WERE HEMMED AND MARKED AND DARNED IN THE OLD FASHIONED PARLOUR BUT ALL THIS CONCERNED ONLY THE OUTER LIFE THERE WAS AS MUCH CULTIVATION AND REFINEMENT OF MIND AS NOW
2391-145015-0107 THE EARLY HOUR AT WHICH HOUNDS THEN MET MAY ACCOUNT FOR THIS
2391-145015-0108 FOR THEY HUNTED AT AN EARLY AGE IN A SCRAMBLING SORT OF WAY UPON ANY PONY OR DONKEY THAT THEY COULD PROCURE OR IN DEFAULT OF SUCH LUXURIES ON FOOT I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT SIR FRANCIS AUSTEN WHEN SEVEN YEARS OLD
2391-145015-0109 BOUGHT ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT IT MUST BE SUPPOSED WITH HIS FATHER'S PERMISSION A PONY FOR A GUINEA AND A HALF AND AFTER RIDING HIM WITH GREAT SUCCESS FOR TWO SEASONS SOLD HIM FOR A GUINEA MORE
2391-145015-0110 THE SAME AUTHORITY INFORMS ME THAT HIS FIRST CLOTH SUIT WAS MADE FROM A SCARLET HABIT WHICH ACCORDING TO THE FASHION OF THE TIMES HAD BEEN HIS MOTHER'S USUAL MORNING DRESS IF ALL THIS IS TRUE
2391-145015-0111 THE FUTURE ADMIRAL OF THE BRITISH FLEET MUST HAVE CUT A CONSPICUOUS FIGURE IN THE HUNTING FIELD THE OTHER PECULIARITY WAS THAT WHEN THE ROADS WERE DIRTY THE SISTERS TOOK LONG WALKS IN PATTENS THIS DEFENCE AGAINST WET AND DIRT IS NOW SELDOM SEEN
2391-145015-0112 THE FEW THAT REMAIN ARE BANISHED FROM GOOD SOCIETY AND EMPLOYED ONLY IN MENIAL WORK BUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO THEY WERE CELEBRATED IN POETRY AND CONSIDERED SO CLEVER A CONTRIVANCE THAT GAY IN HIS TRIVIA
2391-145015-0113 ASCRIBES THE INVENTION TO A GOD STIMULATED BY HIS PASSION FOR A MORTAL DAMSEL AND DERIVES THE NAME PATTEN FROM PATTY THE PATTEN NOW SUPPORTS EACH FRUGAL DAME WHICH FROM THE BLUE EYED PATTY TAKES THE NAME
2391-145015-0114 BUT MORTAL DAMSELS HAVE LONG AGO DISCARDED THE CLUMSY IMPLEMENT FIRST IT DROPPED ITS IRON RING AND BECAME A CLOG AFTERWARDS IT WAS FINED DOWN INTO THE PLIANT GALOSHE LIGHTER TO WEAR AND MORE EFFECTUAL TO PROTECT
2391-145015-0115 A NO LESS MANIFEST INSTANCE OF GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT THAN COWPER INDICATES WHEN HE TRACES THROUGH EIGHTY LINES OF POETRY HIS ACCOMPLISHED SOFA BACK TO THE ORIGINAL THREE LEGGED STOOL
2391-145015-0116 I ADD THE FOLLOWING EPIGRAM WRITTEN BY JANE AUSTEN'S UNCLE MISTER LEIGH PERROT ON READING IN A NEWSPAPER THE MARRIAGE OF CAPTAIN FOOTE TO MISS PATTEN THROUGH THE ROUGH PATHS OF LIFE WITH A PATTEN YOUR GUARD MAY YOU SAFELY AND PLEASANTLY JOG
2391-145015-0117 MAY THE KNOT NEVER SLIP NOR THE RING PRESS TOO HARD NOR THE FOOT FIND THE PATTEN A CLOG AT THE TIME WHEN JANE AUSTEN LIVED AT STEVENTON A WORK WAS CARRIED ON IN THE NEIGHBOURING COTTAGES WHICH OUGHT TO BE RECORDED BECAUSE IT HAS LONG CEASED TO EXIST
2391-145015-0118 THIS WAS A BETTER OCCUPATION FOR THEM THAN STRAW PLAITING
2391-145015-0119 AND DID NOT ADMIT OF GADDING AND GOSSIPING ABOUT THE VILLAGE THE IMPLEMENT USED WAS A LONG NARROW MACHINE OF WOOD RAISED ON LEGS FURNISHED AT ONE END WITH A LARGE WHEEL AND AT THE OTHER WITH A SPINDLE ON WHICH THE FLAX OR WOOL WAS LOOSELY WRAPPED
2391-145015-0120 BALLAD POETRY AND FAIRY TALES ARE FULL OF ALLUSIONS TO IT
2391-145015-0121 IT WAS THE LABOUR ASSIGNED TO THE EJECTED NUNS BY THE ROUGH EARL WHO SAID GO SPIN YE JADES GO SPIN IT WAS THE EMPLOYMENT AT WHICH ROMAN MATRONS AND GRECIAN PRINCESSES PRESIDED AMONGST THEIR HANDMAIDS
2391-145015-0122 HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY CELEBRATED IT IN THE THREE FATES SPINNING AND MEASURING OUT THE THREAD OF HUMAN LIFE
2416-152137-0000 A WHITE GLOVED ARM A VOICE AND A SILVERY LAUGH JUST THAT NO MORE JIMMIE DALE IN HIS FAVOURITE SEAT AN AISLE SEAT SOME SEVEN OR EIGHT ROWS BACK FROM THE ORCHESTRA STARED AT THE STAGE
2416-152137-0001 TO ALL OUTWARD APPEARANCES ABSORBED IN THE LAST ACT OF THE PLAY INWARDLY QUITE OBLIVIOUS TO THE FACT THAT EVEN A PLAY WAS GOING ON A WHITE GLOVED ARM A VOICE
2416-152137-0002 AND A SILVERY LAUGH THE WORDS HAD FORMED THEMSELVES INTO A SORT OF SINGSONG REFRAIN THAT FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS HAD BEEN RUNNING THROUGH HIS HEAD A STRANGE ENOUGH GUIDING STAR TO MOULD AND DICTATE EVERY ACTION IN HIS LIFE
2416-152137-0003 AND THAT WAS ALL HE HAD EVER SEEN OF HER ALL THAT HE HAD EVER HEARD OF HER EXCEPT THOSE LETTERS OF COURSE EACH OF WHICH HAD OUTLINED THE DETAILS OF SOME AFFAIR FOR THE GRAY SEAL TO EXECUTE
2416-152137-0004 INDEED IT SEEMED A GREAT LENGTH OF TIME NOW SINCE HE HAD HEARD FROM HER EVEN IN THAT WAY THOUGH IT WAS NOT SO MANY DAYS AGO AFTER ALL PERHAPS IT WAS THE CALM AS IT WERE THAT BY CONTRAST
2416-152137-0005 HAD GIVEN PLACE TO THE STRENUOUS MONTHS AND WEEKS JUST PAST THE STORM RAISED BY THE NEWSPAPERS AT THE THEFT OF OLD LUDDY'S DIAMONDS HAD SUBSIDED INTO SPORADIC DIATRIBES AIMED AT THE POLICE KLINE
2416-152137-0006 OF THE SECRET SERVICE HAD FINALLY ADMITTED DEFEAT AND A SHADOW NO LONGER SKULKED DAY AND NIGHT AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE SANCTUARY AND LARRY THE BAT BORE THE GOVERNMENT INDORSEMENT SO TO SPEAK OF BEING NO MORE SUSPICIOUS A CHARACTER
2416-152137-0007 THAN THAT OF A DISREPUTABLE BUT HARMLESS DOPE FIEND OF THE UNDERWORLD LARRY THE BAT THE GRAY SEAL JIMMIE DALE THE MILLIONAIRE
2416-152137-0008 SUBCONSCIOUSLY TELEGRAPHING TO HIS MIND THE FACT THAT THE TEXTURE OF THE PAPER WAS HERS HERS AND SHE MUST BE ONE OF THOSE AROUND HIM ONE OF THOSE CROWDING EITHER THE ROW OF SEATS IN FRONT OR BEHIND
2416-152137-0009 OR ONE OF THOSE JUST PASSING IN THE AISLE IT HAD FALLEN AT HIS FEET AS HE HAD STOOPED OVER FOR HIS HAT BUT FROM JUST EXACTLY WHAT DIRECTION HE COULD NOT TELL HIS EYES EAGERLY HUNGRILY
2416-152137-0010 CRITICALLY SWEPT FACE AFTER FACE WHICH ONE WAS HERS WHAT IRONY SHE WHOM HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIS LIFE TO KNOW FOR WHOM INDEED HE RISKED HIS LIFE EVERY HOUR OF THE TWENTY FOUR
2416-152137-0011 WAS CLOSE TO HIM NOW WITHIN REACH AND AS FAR REMOVED AS THOUGH A THOUSAND MILES SEPARATED THEM SHE WAS THERE BUT HE COULD NOT RECOGNISE A FACE THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN
2416-152137-0012 WITH AN EFFORT HE CHOKED BACK THE BITTER IMPOTENT LAUGH THAT ROSE TO HIS LIPS THEY WERE TALKING LAUGHING AROUND HIM HER VOICE YES
2416-152137-0013 HE HAD ONCE HEARD THAT AND THAT HE WOULD RECOGNISE AGAIN HE STRAINED TO CATCH TO INDIVIDUALISE THE TONE SOUNDS THAT FLOATED IN A MEDLEY ABOUT HIM IT WAS USELESS OF COURSE
2416-152137-0014 EVERY EFFORT THAT HE HAD EVER MADE TO FIND HER HAD BEEN USELESS SHE WAS TOO CLEVER FAR TOO CLEVER FOR THAT SHE TOO WOULD KNOW THAT HE COULD AND WOULD RECOGNISE HER VOICE WHERE HE COULD RECOGNISE NOTHING ELSE
2416-152137-0015 AND THEN SUDDENLY HE REALISED THAT HE WAS ATTRACTING ATTENTION LEVEL STARES FROM THE WOMEN RETURNED HIS GAZE
2416-152137-0016 OTHERS IN THE SAME ROW OF SEATS AS HIS OWN WERE IMPATIENTLY WAITING TO GET BY HIM WITH A MUTTERED APOLOGY JIMMIE DALE RAISED THE SEAT OF HIS CHAIR ALLOWING THESE LATTER TO PASS HIM AND THEN
2416-152137-0017 SLIPPING THE LETTER INTO HIS POCKETBOOK HE SNATCHED UP HIS HAT FROM THE SEAT RACK THERE WAS STILL A CHANCE KNOWING HE WAS THERE SHE WOULD BE ON HER GUARD BUT IN THE LOBBY AMONG THE CROWD AND UNAWARE OF HIS PRESENCE
2416-152137-0018 THERE WAS THE POSSIBILITY THAT IF HE COULD REACH THE ENTRANCE AHEAD OF HER SHE TOO MIGHT BE TALKING AND LAUGHING AS SHE LEFT THE THEATRE JUST A SINGLE WORD JUST A TONE THAT WAS ALL HE ASKED
2416-152137-0019 TIGHT PACKED THE MASS OF PEOPLE JOSTLED ELBOWED AND PUSHED GOOD NATUREDLY IT WAS A VOICE NOW HER VOICE THAT HE WAS LISTENING FOR BUT THOUGH IT SEEMED THAT EVERY FACULTY WAS STRAINED AND INTENT UPON THAT ONE EFFORT
2416-152137-0020 HIS EYES TOO HAD IN NO DEGREE RELAXED THEIR VIGILANCE AND ONCE HALF GRIMLY HALF SARDONICALLY HE SMILED TO HIMSELF
2416-152137-0021 WITH THEIR PROSPEROUS WELL GROOMED ESCORTS THERE WAS THE WOWZER OVER THERE SLEEK DAPPER SQUIRMING IN AND OUT OF THE THRONG WITH THE AGILITY AND STEALTH OF A CAT AS LARRY THE BAT HE HAD MET THE WOWZER MANY TIMES
2416-152137-0022 AS INDEED HE HAD MET AND WAS ACQUAINTED WITH MOST OF THE ELITE OF THE UNDERWORLD THE WOWZER BEYOND A SHADOW OF DOUBT IN HIS OWN PROFESSION STOOD UPON A PLANE ENTIRELY BY HIMSELF AMONG THOSE QUALIFIED TO SPEAK
2416-152137-0023 POKE GETTER IN THE UNITED STATES THE CROWD THINNED IN THE LOBBY THINNED DOWN TO THE LAST FEW BELATED STRAGGLERS WHO PASSED HIM AS HE STILL LOITERED IN THE ENTRANCE
2416-152137-0024 AND DISAPPOINTMENT THAT BURNED WITHIN HIM STEPPED OUT TO THE PAVEMENT AND HEADED DOWN BROADWAY AFTER ALL HE HAD KNOWN IT IN HIS HEART OF HEARTS ALL THE TIME IT HAD
2416-152137-0025 ALWAYS BEEN THE SAME IT WAS ONLY ONE MORE OCCASION ADDED TO THE INNUMERABLE ONES THAT HAD GONE BEFORE IN WHICH SHE HAD ELUDED HIM AND NOW THERE WAS THE LETTER
2416-152137-0026 AUTOMATICALLY HE QUICKENED HIS STEPS A LITTLE IT WAS USELESS FUTILE PROFITLESS FOR THE MOMENT AT LEAST TO DISTURB HIMSELF OVER HIS FAILURE THERE WAS THE LETTER
2416-152137-0027 WHAT SUDDEN EMERGENCY WAS THE GRAY SEAL CALLED UPON TO FACE THIS TIME WHAT ROLE UNREHEARSED WITHOUT WARNING MUST HE PLAY WHAT STORY OF GRIM
2416-152137-0028 JIMMIE DALE A BLOCK DOWN HE TURNED FROM BROADWAY OUT OF THE THEATRE CROWDS THAT STREAMED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS PAST HIM THE LETTER
2416-152137-0029 ALMOST FEVERISHLY NOW HE WAS SEEKING AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN AND READ IT UNOBSERVED AN EAGERNESS UPON HIM THAT MINGLED EXHILARATION AT THE LURE OF DANGER WITH A SENSE OF PREMONITION THAT IRRITABLY
2416-152137-0030 INEVITABLY WAS WITH HIM AT MOMENTS SUCH AS THESE IT SEEMED IT ALWAYS SEEMED THAT WITH AN UNOPENED LETTER OF HERS IN HIS POSSESSION IT WAS AS THOUGH HE WERE ABOUT TO OPEN A PAGE IN THE BOOK OF FATE AND READ
2416-152137-0031 A PRONOUNCEMENT UPON HIMSELF THAT MIGHT MEAN LIFE OR DEATH HE HURRIED ON PEOPLE STILL PASSED BY HIM TOO MANY AND THEN A CAFE JUST AHEAD
2416-152137-0032 MAKING A CORNER GAVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY THAT HE SOUGHT AWAY FROM THE ENTRANCE ON THE SIDE STREET THE BRILLIANT LIGHTS FROM THE WINDOWS SHONE OUT ON A COMPARATIVELY DESERTED PAVEMENT
2416-152137-0033 THERE WAS AMPLE LIGHT TO READ BY EVEN AS FAR AWAY FROM THE WINDOW AS THE CURB AND JIMMIE DALE WITH AN APPROVING NOD TURNED THE CORNER AND WALKED ALONG A FEW STEPS UNTIL OPPOSITE THE FARTHEST WINDOW BUT
2416-152137-0034 AS HE HALTED HERE AT THE EDGE OF THE STREET HE GLANCED QUICKLY BEHIND HIM AT A MAN WHOM HE HAD JUST PASSED THE OTHER HAD PAUSED AT THE CORNER AND WAS STARING DOWN THE STREET JIMMIE DALE INSTANTLY AND NONCHALANTLY PRODUCED HIS CIGARETTE CASE
2416-152137-0035 SELECTED A CIGARETTE AND FASTIDIOUSLY TAPPED ITS END ON HIS THUMB NAIL INSPECTOR BURTON IN PLAIN CLOTHES HE OBSERVED MUSINGLY TO HIMSELF I WONDER IF IT'S JUST A FLUKE
2416-152137-0036 OR SOMETHING ELSE WE'LL SEE JIMMIE DALE TOOK A BOX OF MATCHES FROM HIS POCKET THE FIRST WOULD NOT LIGHT

2436-2481-0000 DOCTOR FRANK'S FACE HAD GONE WHITE SNAP STOOD LIKE A STATUE OF HORROR THE DECK HERE WAS PATCHED AS ALWAYS WITH SILVER RADIANCE FROM THE DECK PORTS THE EMPTY DECK CHAIRS STOOD ABOUT THE SCREAM
2436-2481-0001 WAS STILLED BUT NOW WE HEARD A COMMOTION INSIDE THE RASP OF OPENING CABIN DOORS QUESTIONS FROM FRIGHTENED PASSENGERS I FOUND MY VOICE ANITA ANITA PRINCE COME ON
2436-2481-0002 HE WAS DASHING FOR THE LOUNGE ARCHWAY DOCTOR FRANK AND I FOLLOWED I REALIZED THAT WE PASSED THE DECK DOOR AND WINDOW OF A TWENTY TWO BUT THEY WERE DARK AND EVIDENTLY SEALED ON THE INSIDE
2436-2481-0003 PASSENGERS STANDING AT THEIR CABIN DOORS I SHOUTED GO BACK TO YOUR ROOMS WE WANT ORDER HERE KEEP BACK WE CAME TO THE TWIN DOORS OF A TWENTY TWO AND A TWENTY BOTH WERE CLOSED DOCTOR FRANK WAS IN ADVANCE OF SNAP AND ME NOW

2436-2481-0013 BLACKSTONE AND I SAT IN THE TINY CHART ROOM HOW MUCH TIME PASSED I DO NOT KNOW I WAS CONFUSED ANITA HURT SHE MIGHT DIE MURDERED
2436-2481-0014 BUT WHY BY WHOM HAD GEORGE PRINCE BEEN IN HIS OWN ROOM WHEN THE ATTACK CAME I THOUGHT NOW I RECALLED HEARING THE LOW MURMUR OF HIS VOICE IN THERE WITH DOCTOR FRANK
2436-2481-0015 DOCTOR FRANK AND HER BROTHER ARE WITH HER THEY'RE DOING ALL THEY CAN HE TOLD US WHAT HAD HAPPENED ANITA AND GEORGE PRINCE HAD BOTH BEEN ASLEEP EACH IN HIS RESPECTIVE ROOM SOMEONE UNKNOWN

2436-2481-0018 NOR DID PRINCE HER SCREAM AWAKENED HIM
2436-2481-0019 I WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO GET AWAY I WOULD LIE DOWN FOR AN HOUR AND THEN GO TO ANITA'S STATEROOM I'D DEMAND THAT DOCTOR FRANK LET ME SEE HER I WENT TO THE STERN DECK WHERE MY CUBBY WAS LOCATED MY MIND WAS

2436-2481-0021 I TOLD HIM ABOUT ANITA CARTER CUT IN ON US FROM THE CHART ROOM STOP THAT YOU FOOLS WE CUT OFF FULLY DRESSED I FLUNG MYSELF ON MY BED ANITA MIGHT DIE I MUST HAVE FALLEN INTO A
2436-2481-0022 TORTURED SLEEP I WAS AWAKENED BY THE SOUND OF MY ALARM BUZZER SOMEONE WAS TAMPERING WITH MY DOOR THEN THE BUZZER CEASED THE MARAUDER OUTSIDE MUST HAVE FOUND A WAY OF SILENCING IT BUT IT HAD DONE ITS WORK AWAKENED ME
2436-2481-0023 SOMEONE OUTSIDE TRYING TO UNSEAL THE DOOR IN THE DARKNESS CYLINDER IN HAND I CREPT SOFTLY FROM THE BUNK CROUCHED AT THE DOOR THIS TIME I WOULD CAPTURE OR KILL THIS NIGHT PROWLER
2436-2481-0024 THE SIZZLING WAS FAINTLY AUDIBLE MY DOOR SEAL WAS BREAKING UPON IMPULSE I REACHED FOR THE DOOR JERKED IT OPEN NO ONE THERE
2436-2481-0025 WAS EMPTY BUT I LEAPED AND STRUCK A SOLID BODY CROUCHING IN THE DOORWAY A GIANT MAN
2436-2481-0026 HIS ELECTRONIZED METALLIC ROBE BURNED MY HANDS I LUNGED AGAINST HIM I WAS ALMOST AS SURPRISED AS HE I SHOT BUT THE STAB OF HEAT EVIDENTLY MISSED HIM THE SHOCK OF MY ENCOUNTER SHORT CIRCUITED HIS ROBE HE MATERIALIZED IN THE STARLIGHT A BRIEF
2436-2481-0027 SAVAGE ENCOUNTER HE STRUCK THE WEAPON FROM MY HAND HE HAD DROPPED HIS HYDROGEN TORCH AND TRIED TO GRIP ME BUT I TWISTED AWAY FROM HIS HOLD SO IT'S YOU QUIET GREGG HALJAN I ONLY WANT TO TALK WITHOUT WARNING A STAB OF RADIANCE SHOT FROM A WEAPON IN HIS HAND
2436-2481-0028 IT CAUGHT ME RAN LIKE ICE THROUGH MY VEINS SEIZED AND NUMBED MY LIMBS I FELL HELPLESS TO THE DECK NERVES AND MUSCLES PARALYZED MY TONGUE WAS THICK AND INERT I COULD NOT SPEAK NOR MOVE
2436-2481-0029 AND HEAR HIM I DON'T WANT TO KILL YOU HALJAN WE NEED YOU HE GATHERED ME UP LIKE A BUNDLE IN HIS HUGE ARMS CARRIED ME SWIFTLY ACROSS THE DESERTED DECK
2436-2481-0030 HIS WARNING SIREN RANG OUT TO ALERT THE SHIP HIS SPOTLIGHT CLUNG TO US MIKO RAN WITH ME A FEW STEPS THEN HE CURSED AND DROPPED ME FLED AWAY I FELL LIKE A SACK OF CARBIDE TO THE DECK
2436-2481-0031 MY TONGUE WAS THICK BUT IT MOVED YES I WAS SOON REVIVED I SAT UP WITH DOCTOR FRANK VIGOROUSLY RUBBING ME I'M ALL RIGHT I TOLD THEM WHAT HAD HAPPENED
2436-2481-0032 SHE TOLD US BEFORE SHE DIED DIED I LEAPED TO MY FEET SHE DIED YES GREGG AN HOUR AGO
2436-2481-0033 MIKO GOT INTO HER STATEROOM AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS LOVE UPON HER SHE REPULSED HIM HE KILLED HER IT STRUCK ME BLANK AND THEN WITH A RUSH CAME THE THOUGHT
2436-2481-0034 WE MUST GET HIM I GATHERED MY WITS A SURGE OF HATE SWEPT ME A WILD DESIRE FOR VENGEANCE WHY BY GOD WHERE IS HE
2436-2481-0035 DOCTOR FRANK GRIPPED ME THE CAPTAIN SAID GENTLY WE KNOW HOW YOU FEEL GREGG SHE TOLD US BEFORE SHE DIED I'LL BRING HIM IN HERE TO YOU BUT I'LL KILL HIM I TELL YOU NO YOU WON'T LAD
2436-2481-0036 WE DON'T WANT HIM KILLED NOT ATTACKED EVEN NOT YET WE'LL EXPLAIN LATER THEY SAT ME DOWN CALMING ME ANITA DEAD
2436-2481-0037 THE DOOR OF THE SHINING GARDEN WAS CLOSED A BRIEF GLIMPSE GIVEN TO ME AND TO HER OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AND NOW
248-130644-0000 IT WOULD BE A LITTLE HARD TO BLAME THE RECTOR OF PENNICOTE THAT IN THE COURSE OF LOOKING AT THINGS FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW HE LOOKED AT GWENDOLEN AS A GIRL LIKELY TO MAKE A BRILLIANT MARRIAGE
248-130644-0001 WHY SHOULD HE BE EXPECTED TO DIFFER FROM HIS CONTEMPORARIES IN THIS MATTER AND WISH HIS NIECE A WORSE END OF HER CHARMING MAIDENHOOD THAN THEY WOULD APPROVE AS THE BEST POSSIBLE
248-130644-0002 IT IS RATHER TO BE SET DOWN TO HIS CREDIT THAT HIS FEELINGS ON THE SUBJECT WERE ENTIRELY GOOD NATURED AND IN CONSIDERING THE RELATION OF MEANS TO ENDS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MERE FOLLY TO HAVE BEEN GUIDED BY THE EXCEPTIONAL AND IDYLLIC
248-130644-0003 IN ORDER THAT A MARQUIS MIGHT FALL IN LOVE WITH HER OR TO HAVE INSISTED THAT SINCE A FAIR MAIDEN WAS TO BE SOUGHT SHE SHOULD KEEP HERSELF OUT OF THE WAY MISTER GASCOIGNE'S CALCULATIONS WERE OF THE KIND CALLED RATIONAL
248-130644-0004 AND HE DID NOT EVEN THINK OF GETTING A TOO FRISKY HORSE IN ORDER THAT GWENDOLEN MIGHT BE THREATENED WITH AN ACCIDENT AND BE RESCUED BY A MAN OF PROPERTY HE WISHED HIS NIECE WELL AND HE MEANT HER TO BE SEEN TO ADVANTAGE IN THE BEST SOCIETY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
248-130644-0005 HER UNCLE'S INTENTION FELL IN PERFECTLY WITH GWENDOLEN'S OWN WISHES BUT LET NO ONE SUPPOSE THAT SHE ALSO CONTEMPLATED A BRILLIANT MARRIAGE AS THE DIRECT END OF HER WITCHING THE WORLD WITH HER GRACE ON HORSEBACK OR WITH ANY OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENT
248-130644-0006 THAT SHE WAS TO BE MARRIED SOME TIME OR OTHER SHE WOULD HAVE FELT OBLIGED TO ADMIT AND THAT HER MARRIAGE WOULD NOT BE OF A MIDDLING KIND SUCH AS MOST GIRLS WERE CONTENTED WITH SHE FELT QUIETLY UNARGUMENTATIVELY SURE
248-130644-0007 BUT HER THOUGHTS NEVER DWELT ON MARRIAGE AS THE FULFILLMENT OF HER AMBITION THE DRAMAS IN WHICH SHE IMAGINED HERSELF A HEROINE WERE NOT WROUGHT UP TO THAT CLOSE TO BE VERY MUCH SUED OR HOPELESSLY SIGHED FOR AS A BRIDE WAS INDEED
248-130644-0008 AN INDISPENSABLE AND AGREEABLE GUARANTEE OF WOMANLY POWER BUT TO BECOME A WIFE AND WEAR ALL THE DOMESTIC FETTERS OF THAT CONDITION WAS ON THE WHOLE A VEXATIOUS NECESSITY HER OBSERVATION OF MATRIMONY HAD INCLINED HER TO THINK IT RATHER A DREARY STATE
248-130644-0009 IN WHICH A WOMAN COULD NOT DO WHAT SHE LIKED HAD MORE CHILDREN THAN WERE DESIRABLE WAS CONSEQUENTLY DULL AND BECAME IRREVOCABLY IMMERSED IN HUMDRUM OF COURSE MARRIAGE WAS SOCIAL PROMOTION
248-130644-0010 SHE COULD NOT LOOK FORWARD TO A SINGLE LIFE BUT PROMOTIONS HAVE SOMETIMES TO BE TAKEN WITH BITTER HERBS A PEERAGE WILL NOT QUITE DO INSTEAD OF LEADERSHIP TO THE MAN WHO MEANT TO LEAD AND THIS DELICATE LIMBED SYLPH OF TWENTY MEANT TO LEAD
248-130644-0011 FOR SUCH PASSIONS DWELL IN FEMININE BREASTS ALSO IN GWENDOLEN'S HOWEVER THEY DWELT AMONG STRICTLY FEMININE FURNITURE AND HAD NO DISTURBING REFERENCE TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING OR THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION
248-130644-0012 HER KNOWLEDGE BEING SUCH AS WITH NO SORT OF STANDING ROOM OR LENGTH OF LEVER COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO MOVE THE WORLD SHE MEANT TO DO WHAT WAS PLEASANT TO HERSELF IN A STRIKING MANNER
248-130644-0013 AND TO HAVE THEIR LIVES BLOWN HITHER AND THITHER LIKE EMPTY SHIPS IN WHICH NO WILL WAS PRESENT IT WAS NOT TO BE SO WITH HER SHE WOULD NO LONGER BE SACRIFICED TO CREATURES WORTH LESS THAN HERSELF
248-130644-0014 BUT WOULD MAKE THE VERY BEST OF THE CHANCES THAT LIFE OFFERED HER AND CONQUER CIRCUMSTANCES BY HER EXCEPTIONAL CLEVERNESS
248-130644-0015 THE ARCHERY CLUB AND INVITATIONS TO DINE WITH THE ARROWPOINTS AS THE HIGHEST LIGHTS IN HER SCENERY WAS NOT A POSITION THAT SEEMED TO OFFER REMARKABLE CHANCES BUT GWENDOLEN'S CONFIDENCE LAY CHIEFLY IN HERSELF
248-130644-0016 SHE FELT WELL EQUIPPED FOR THE MASTERY OF LIFE WITH REGARD TO MUCH IN HER LOT HITHERTO SHE HELD HERSELF RATHER HARDLY DEALT WITH BUT AS TO HER EDUCATION SHE WOULD HAVE ADMITTED THAT IT HAD LEFT HER UNDER NO DISADVANTAGES
248-130644-0017 IN THE SCHOOL ROOM HER QUICK MIND HAD TAKEN READILY THAT STRONG STARCH OF UNEXPLAINED RULES AND DISCONNECTED FACTS WHICH SAVES IGNORANCE FROM ANY PAINFUL SENSE OF LIMPNESS
248-130644-0018 AND WHAT REMAINED OF ALL THINGS KNOWABLE SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF BEING SUFFICIENTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THROUGH NOVELS PLAYS AND POEMS ABOUT HER FRENCH AND MUSIC THE TWO JUSTIFYING ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF A YOUNG LADY SHE FELT NO GROUND FOR UNEASINESS
248-130644-0019 AND WHEN TO ALL THESE QUALIFICATIONS NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE WE ADD THE SPONTANEOUS SENSE OF CAPABILITY SOME HAPPY PERSONS ARE BORN WITH SO THAT ANY SUBJECT THEY TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO IMPRESSES THEM WITH THEIR OWN POWER OF FORMING A CORRECT JUDGMENT ON IT
248-130644-0020 WHO CAN WONDER IF GWENDOLEN FELT READY TO MANAGE HER OWN DESTINY THERE WERE MANY SUBJECTS IN THE WORLD PERHAPS THE MAJORITY IN WHICH SHE FELT NO INTEREST BECAUSE THEY WERE STUPID
248-130644-0021 FOR SUBJECTS ARE APT TO APPEAR STUPID TO THE YOUNG AS LIGHT SEEMS DULL TO THE OLD BUT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE FELT AT ALL HELPLESS IN RELATION TO THEM IF THEY HAD TURNED UP IN CONVERSATION IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT NO ONE HAD DISPUTED HER POWER OR HER GENERAL SUPERIORITY
248-130644-0022 WHAT WILL GWENDOLEN THINK IF THE FOOTMAN TROD HEAVILY IN CREAKING BOOTS OR IF THE LAUNDRESS'S WORK WAS UNSATISFACTORY THE MAID SAID THIS WILL NEVER DO FOR MISS HARLETH
248-130644-0023 IF THE WOOD SMOKED IN THE BEDROOM FIREPLACE MISSUS DAVILOW WHOSE OWN WEAK EYES SUFFERED MUCH FROM THIS INCONVENIENCE SPOKE APOLOGETICALLY OF IT TO GWENDOLEN
248-130644-0024 IF WHEN THEY WERE UNDER THE STRESS OF TRAVELING SHE DID NOT APPEAR AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE TILL EVERY ONE ELSE HAD FINISHED THE ONLY QUESTION WAS HOW GWENDOLEN'S COFFEE AND TOAST SHOULD STILL BE OF THE HOTTEST AND CRISPEST
248-130644-0025 IT WAS ALWAYS SHE HERSELF WHO HAD TO BE TOLERANT TO BEG THAT ALICE WHO SAT WAITING ON HER WOULD NOT STICK UP HER SHOULDERS IN THAT FRIGHTFUL MANNER AND THAT ISABEL INSTEAD OF PUSHING UP TO HER AND ASKING QUESTIONS WOULD GO AWAY TO MISS MERRY
248-130644-0026 ALWAYS SHE WAS THE PRINCESS IN EXILE WHO IN TIME OF FAMINE WAS TO HAVE HER BREAKFAST ROLL MADE OF THE FINEST BOLTED FLOUR FROM THE SEVEN THIN EARS OF WHEAT AND IN A GENERAL DECAMPMENT WAS TO HAVE HER SILVER FORK KEPT OUT OF THE BAGGAGE
248-130644-0027 HOW WAS THIS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR THE ANSWER MAY SEEM TO LIE QUITE ON THE SURFACE IN HER BEAUTY A CERTAIN UNUSUALNESS ABOUT HER
248-130644-0028 A DECISION OF WILL WHICH MADE ITSELF FELT IN HER GRACEFUL MOVEMENTS AND CLEAR UNHESITATING TONES SO THAT IF SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM ON A RAINY DAY WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE WAS FLACCID AND THE USE OF THINGS IN GENERAL WAS NOT APPARENT TO THEM
248-130644-0029 THERE SEEMED TO BE A SUDDEN SUFFICIENT REASON FOR KEEPING UP THE FORMS OF LIFE AND EVEN THE WAITERS AT HOTELS SHOWED THE MORE ALACRITY IN DOING AWAY WITH CRUMBS AND CREASES AND DREGS WITH STRUGGLING FLIES IN THEM
248-130644-0030 THIS POTENT CHARM ADDED TO THE FACT THAT SHE WAS THE ELDEST DAUGHTER TOWARD WHOM HER MAMMA HAD ALWAYS BEEN IN AN APOLOGETIC STATE OF MIND FOR THE EVILS BROUGHT ON HER BY A STEP FATHER MAY SEEM SO FULL A REASON FOR GWENDOLEN'S DOMESTIC EMPIRE
248-130644-0031 THAT TO LOOK FOR ANY OTHER WOULD BE TO ASK THE REASON OF DAYLIGHT WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING BUT BEWARE OF ARRIVING AT CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT COMPARISON
248-130644-0032 WHOSE FIRMNESS SHOWED ITSELF IN NO VERY GRACEFUL OR EUPHONIOUS WAY AND WHO WERE NOT ELDEST DAUGHTERS WITH A TENDER TIMID MOTHER COMPUNCTIOUS AT HAVING SUBJECTED THEM TO INCONVENIENCES
248-130644-0033 SOME OF THEM WERE A VERY COMMON SORT OF MEN AND THE ONLY POINT OF RESEMBLANCE AMONG THEM ALL WAS A STRONG DETERMINATION TO HAVE WHAT WAS PLEASANT WITH A TOTAL FEARLESSNESS IN MAKING THEMSELVES DISAGREEABLE OR DANGEROUS WHEN THEY DID NOT GET IT
248-130644-0034 THE FEAR AND THE FONDNESS BEING PERHAPS BOTH HEIGHTENED BY WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE IRIDESCENCE OF HER CHARACTER THE PLAY OF VARIOUS NAY CONTRARY TENDENCIES
248-130644-0035 FOR MACBETH'S RHETORIC ABOUT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF BEING MANY OPPOSITE THINGS IN THE SAME MOMENT REFERRED TO THE CLUMSY NECESSITIES OF ACTION AND NOT TO THE SUBTLER POSSIBILITIES OF FEELING WE CANNOT SPEAK A LOYAL WORD AND BE MEANLY SILENT
248-130644-0036 WE CANNOT KILL AND NOT KILL IN THE SAME MOMENT
248-130652-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE O GENTLEMEN THE TIME OF LIFE IS SHORT TO SPEND THAT SHORTNESS BASELY WERE TOO LONG IF LIFE DID RIDE UPON A DIAL'S POINT STILL ENDING AT THE ARRIVAL OF AN HOUR SHAKESPEARE
248-130652-0001 ON THE SECOND DAY AFTER THE ARCHERY MEETING MISTER HENLEIGH MALLINGER GRANDCOURT WAS AT HIS BREAKFAST TABLE WITH MISTER LUSH EVERYTHING AROUND THEM WAS AGREEABLE
248-130652-0002 THE STILL LIFE IN THE ROOM WHICH SEEMED THE STILLER FOR ITS SOBER ANTIQUATED ELEGANCE AS IF IT KEPT A CONSCIOUS WELL BRED SILENCE UNLIKE THE RESTLESSNESS OF VULGAR FURNITURE WHETHER THE GENTLEMEN WERE AGREEABLE TO EACH OTHER WAS LESS EVIDENT
248-130652-0003 MISTER GRANDCOURT HAD DRAWN HIS CHAIR ASIDE SO AS TO FACE THE LAWN AND WITH HIS LEFT LEG OVER ANOTHER CHAIR AND HIS RIGHT ELBOW ON THE TABLE WAS SMOKING A LARGE CIGAR WHILE HIS COMPANION WAS STILL EATING THE DOGS
248-130652-0004 GAVE A VACILLATING PREFERENCE FIRST TO ONE GENTLEMAN THEN TO THE OTHER BEING DOGS IN SUCH GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY COULD PLAY AT HUNGER AND LIKED TO BE SERVED WITH DELICACIES WHICH THEY DECLINED TO PUT IN THEIR MOUTHS ALL EXCEPT FETCH
248-130652-0005 THE BEAUTIFUL LIVER COLORED WATER SPANIEL WHICH SAT WITH ITS FOREPAWS FIRMLY PLANTED AND ITS EXPRESSIVE BROWN FACE TURNED UPWARD WATCHING GRANDCOURT WITH UNSHAKEN CONSTANCY
248-130652-0006 HE HELD IN HIS LAP A TINY MALTESE DOG WITH A TINY SILVER COLLAR AND BELL AND WHEN HE HAD A HAND UNUSED BY CIGAR OR COFFEE CUP IT RESTED ON THIS SMALL PARCEL OF ANIMAL WARMTH
248-130652-0007 GRANDCOURT LOOKED AT HER WITH UNCHANGED FACE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN TOOK THE TROUBLE TO LAY DOWN HIS CIGAR WHILE HE LIFTED THE UNIMPASSIONED FLUFF CLOSE TO HIS CHIN AND GAVE IT CARESSING PATS ALL THE WHILE GRAVELY WATCHING FETCH
248-130652-0008 WHO POOR THING WHIMPERED INTERRUPTEDLY AS IF TRYING TO REPRESS THAT SIGN OF DISCONTENT AND AT LAST RESTED HER HEAD BESIDE THE APPEALING PAW LOOKING UP WITH PITEOUS BESEECHING SO AT LEAST A LOVER OF DOGS MUST HAVE INTERPRETED FETCH
248-130652-0009 AND GRANDCOURT KEPT SO MANY DOGS THAT HE WAS REPUTED TO LOVE THEM AT ANY RATE HIS IMPULSE TO ACT JUST IN THAT WAY STARTED FROM SUCH AN INTERPRETATION BUT WHEN THE AMUSING ANGUISH BURST FORTH IN A HOWLING BARK
248-130652-0010 THAT THE BRUTE OF A CIGAR REQUIRED RELIGHTING FETCH HAVING BEGUN TO WAIL FOUND LIKE OTHERS OF HER SEX THAT IT WAS NOT EASY TO LEAVE OFF INDEED THE SECOND HOWL WAS A LOUDER ONE AND THE THIRD WAS LIKE UNTO IT
248-130652-0011 TURN OUT THAT BRUTE WILL YOU SAID GRANDCOURT TO LUSH WITHOUT RAISING HIS VOICE OR LOOKING AT HIM AS IF HE COUNTED ON ATTENTION TO THE SMALLEST SIGN AND LUSH IMMEDIATELY ROSE LIFTED FETCH THOUGH SHE WAS RATHER HEAVY
248-130652-0012 SHALL YOU RIDE OR DRIVE TO QUETCHAM TO DAY I AM NOT GOING TO QUETCHAM YOU DID NOT GO YESTERDAY GRANDCOURT SMOKED IN SILENCE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN SAID
248-130652-0013 I SUPPOSE YOU SENT MY CARD AND INQUIRIES I WENT MYSELF AT FOUR AND SAID YOU WERE SURE TO BE THERE SHORTLY THEY WOULD SUPPOSE SOME ACCIDENT PREVENTED YOU FROM FULFILLING THE INTENTION ESPECIALLY IF YOU GO TO DAY
248-130652-0014 SILENCE FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES THEN GRANDCOURT SAID WHAT MEN ARE INVITED HERE WITH THEIR WIVES
248-130652-0015 THEN THERE ARE MISTER HOLLIS AND LADY FLORA AND THE CUSHATS AND THE GOGOFFS RATHER A RAGGED LOT REMARKED GRANDCOURT AFTER A WHILE WHY DID YOU ASK THE GOGOFFS
248-130652-0016 GRANDCOURT LIKE MANY OTHERS HAD TWO REMARKABLY DIFFERENT VOICES HITHERTO WE HAVE HEARD HIM SPEAKING IN A SUPERFICIAL INTERRUPTED DRAWL SUGGESTIVE CHIEFLY OF LANGUOR
248-130652-0017 AND ONE OF YOUR DAMNED MUSICIANS BUT NOT A COMIC FELLOW I WONDER IF KLESMER WOULD CONSENT TO COME TO US WHEN HE LEAVES QUETCHAM NOTHING BUT FIRST CLASS MUSIC WILL GO DOWN WITH MISS ARROWPOINT
248-130652-0018 LUSH SPOKE CARELESSLY BUT HE WAS REALLY SEIZING AN OPPORTUNITY AND FIXING AN OBSERVANT LOOK ON GRANDCOURT WHO NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME TURNED HIS EYES TOWARD HIS COMPANION BUT SLOWLY AND WITHOUT SPEAKING UNTIL HE HAD GIVEN TWO LONG LUXURIANT PUFFS
248-130652-0019 WHEN HE SAID PERHAPS IN A LOWER TONE THAN EVER BUT WITH A PERCEPTIBLE EDGE OF CONTEMPT WHAT IN THE NAME OF NONSENSE HAVE I TO DO WITH MISS ARROWPOINT AND HER MUSIC
248-130652-0020 YOU NEED NOT GIVE YOURSELF MUCH TROUBLE PERHAPS BUT SOME FORMS MUST BE GONE THROUGH BEFORE A MAN CAN MARRY A MILLION VERY LIKELY BUT I AM NOT GOING TO MARRY A MILLION
248-130652-0021 THAT'S A PITY TO FLING AWAY AN OPPORTUNITY OF THIS SORT AND KNOCK DOWN YOUR OWN PLANS YOUR PLANS I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN YOU HAVE SOME DEBTS YOU KNOW AND THINGS MAY TURN OUT INCONVENIENTLY AFTER ALL
248-130652-0022 AND THE DAUGHTER'S LOOKS AND MANNERS REQUIRE NO ALLOWANCES ANY MORE THAN IF SHE HADN'T A SIXPENCE SHE IS NOT BEAUTIFUL BUT EQUAL TO CARRYING ANY RANK AND SHE IS NOT LIKELY TO REFUSE SUCH PROSPECTS AS YOU CAN OFFER HER
248-130652-0023 PERHAPS NOT THE FATHER AND MOTHER WOULD LET YOU DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE WITH THEM BUT I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO DO ANYTHING WITH THEM HERE IT WAS LUSH WHO MADE A LITTLE PAUSE BEFORE SPEAKING AGAIN
248-130652-0024 AND THEN HE SAID IN A DEEP VOICE OF REMONSTRANCE GOOD GOD GRANDCOURT AFTER YOUR EXPERIENCE WILL YOU LET A WHIM INTERFERE WITH YOUR COMFORTABLE SETTLEMENT IN LIFE SPARE YOUR ORATORY I KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO DO
248-130652-0025 WHAT LUSH PUT DOWN HIS CIGAR AND THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS SIDE POCKETS AS IF HE HAD TO FACE SOMETHING EXASPERATING BUT MEANT TO KEEP HIS TEMPER I AM GOING TO MARRY THE OTHER GIRL
248-130652-0026 HAVE YOU FALLEN IN LOVE THIS QUESTION CARRIED A STRONG SNEER I AM GOING TO MARRY HER YOU HAVE MADE HER AN OFFER ALREADY THEN NO SHE IS A YOUNG LADY WITH A WILL OF HER OWN I FANCY
248-130652-0027 EXTREMELY WELL FITTED TO MAKE A RUMPUS SHE WOULD KNOW WHAT SHE LIKED SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOU SAID GRANDCOURT WITH THE GHOST OF A SMILE PERFECTLY TRUE SAID LUSH ADDING AGAIN IN A MARKEDLY SNEERING TONE
248-130652-0028 HOWEVER IF YOU AND SHE ARE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER THAT WILL BE ENOUGH GRANDCOURT TOOK NO NOTICE OF THIS SPEECH BUT SIPPED HIS COFFEE ROSE AND STROLLED OUT ON THE LAWN ALL THE DOGS FOLLOWING HIM
248-130652-0029 LUSH GLANCED AFTER HIM A MOMENT THEN RESUMED HIS CIGAR AND LIT IT BUT SMOKED SLOWLY CONSULTING HIS BEARD WITH INSPECTING EYES AND FINGERS TILL HE FINALLY STROKED IT WITH AN AIR OF HAVING ARRIVED AT SOME CONCLUSION AND SAID IN A SUBDUED VOICE
248-130652-0030 CHECK OLD BOY LUSH BEING A MAN OF SOME ABILITY HAD NOT KNOWN GRANDCOURT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WITHOUT LEARNING WHAT SORT OF MEASURES WERE USELESS WITH HIM THOUGH WHAT SORT MIGHT BE USEFUL REMAINED OFTEN DUBIOUS
248-130652-0031 IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER HE HELD A FELLOWSHIP AND WAS NEAR TAKING ORDERS FOR THE SAKE OF A COLLEGE LIVING BUT NOT BEING FOND OF THAT PROSPECT ACCEPTED INSTEAD THE OFFICE OF TRAVELING COMPANION TO A MARQUESS AND AFTERWARD TO YOUNG GRANDCOURT
248-130652-0032 WHO HAD LOST HIS FATHER EARLY AND WHO FOUND LUSH SO CONVENIENT THAT HE HAD ALLOWED HIM TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER IN ALL HIS MORE PERSONAL AFFAIRS THE HABIT OF FIFTEEN YEARS HAD MADE GRANDCOURT MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF LUSH'S HANDINESS
248-130652-0033 AND LUSH MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF THE LAZY LUXURY TO WHICH HIS TRANSACTIONS ON BEHALF OF GRANDCOURT MADE NO INTERRUPTION WORTH RECKONING I CANNOT SAY THAT THE SAME LENGTHENED HABIT HAD INTENSIFIED GRANDCOURT'S WANT OF RESPECT FOR HIS COMPANION
248-130652-0034 SINCE THAT WANT HAD BEEN ABSOLUTE FROM THE BEGINNING BUT IT HAD CONFIRMED HIS SENSE THAT HE MIGHT KICK LUSH IF HE CHOSE ONLY HE NEVER DID CHOOSE TO KICK ANY ANIMAL BECAUSE THE ACT OF KICKING IS A COMPROMISING ATTITUDE
248-130652-0035 AND A GENTLEMAN'S DOGS SHOULD BE KICKED FOR HIM HE ONLY SAID THINGS WHICH MIGHT HAVE EXPOSED HIMSELF TO BE KICKED IF HIS CONFIDANT HAD BEEN A MAN OF INDEPENDENT SPIRIT
248-130652-0036 BUT WHAT SON OF A VICAR WHO HAS STINTED HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS OF CALICO IN ORDER TO SEND HIS MALE OFFSPRING TO OXFORD CAN KEEP AN INDEPENDENT SPIRIT WHEN HE IS BENT ON DINING WITH HIGH DISCRIMINATION RIDING GOOD HORSES
248-130652-0037 LIVING GENERALLY IN THE MOST LUXURIANT HONEY BLOSSOMED CLOVER AND ALL WITHOUT WORKING MISTER LUSH HAD PASSED FOR A SCHOLAR ONCE AND HAD STILL A SENSE OF SCHOLARSHIP WHEN HE WAS NOT TRYING TO REMEMBER MUCH OF IT
248-130652-0038 SINCE IN HIS OWN OPINION HE HAD NEVER DONE A BAD ACTION IT DID NOT SEEM NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WHETHER HE SHOULD BE LIKELY TO COMMIT ONE IF HIS LOVE OF EASE REQUIRED IT LUSH'S LOVE OF EASE WAS WELL SATISFIED AT PRESENT
248-130652-0039 AND IF HIS PUDDINGS WERE ROLLED TOWARD HIM IN THE DUST HE TOOK THE INSIDE BITS AND FOUND THEM RELISHING
248-130697-0000 ALL THINGS ARE CHANGES NOT INTO NOTHING BUT INTO THAT WHICH IS NOT AT PRESENT MARCUS AURELIUS
248-130697-0001 DEEDS ARE THE PULSE OF TIME HIS BEATING LIFE AND RIGHTEOUS OR UNRIGHTEOUS BEING DONE MUST THROB IN AFTER THROBS TILL TIME ITSELF BE LAID IN DARKNESS
248-130697-0002 AND THE UNIVERSE QUIVER AND BREATHE UPON NO MIRROR MORE IN THE EVENING SHE SENT FOR HIM AGAIN IT WAS ALREADY NEAR THE HOUR AT WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN FROM THE SEA THE EVENING BEFORE
248-130697-0003 AND THE LIGHT WAS SUBDUED ENOUGH WITH BLINDS DRAWN UP AND WINDOWS OPEN SHE WAS SEATED GAZING FIXEDLY ON THE SEA RESTING HER CHEEK ON HER HAND LOOKING LESS SHATTERED THAN WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER BUT WITH A DEEP MELANCHOLY IN HER EXPRESSION
248-130697-0004 WHICH AS DERONDA APPROACHED HER PASSED INTO AN ANXIOUS TIMIDITY SHE DID NOT PUT OUT HER HAND BUT SAID HOW LONG AGO IT IS THEN WILL YOU SIT NEAR ME AGAIN A LITTLE WHILE
248-130697-0005 AND AGAIN TURNED WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION WHICH YET DID NOT ISSUE IN SPEECH THERE WAS SOME FEAR HINDERING HER AND DERONDA WISHING TO RELIEVE HER TIMIDITY AVERTED HIS FACE
248-130697-0006 PRESENTLY HE HEARD HER CRY IMPLORINGLY YOU WILL NOT SAY THAT ANY ONE ELSE SHOULD KNOW MOST DECIDEDLY NOT SAID DERONDA THERE IS NO ACTION THAT OUGHT TO BE TAKEN IN CONSEQUENCE
248-130697-0007 BUT IF I HAD NOT HAD THAT MURDEROUS WILL THAT MOMENT IF I HAD THROWN THE ROPE ON THE INSTANT PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE HINDERED DEATH NO I THINK NOT SAID DERONDA SLOWLY
248-130697-0008 IF IT WERE TRUE THAT HE COULD SWIM HE MUST HAVE BEEN SEIZED WITH CRAMP WITH YOUR QUICKEST UTMOST EFFORT IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO SAVE HIM
248-130697-0009 THAT MOMENTARY MURDEROUS WILL CANNOT I THINK HAVE ALTERED THE COURSE OF EVENTS ITS EFFECT IS CONFINED TO THE MOTIVES IN YOUR OWN BREAST WITHIN OURSELVES OUR EVIL WILL IS MOMENTOUS
248-130697-0010 AND SOONER OR LATER IT WORKS ITS WAY OUTSIDE US IT MAY BE IN THE VITIATION THAT BREEDS EVIL ACTS BUT ALSO IT MAY BE IN THE SELF ABHORRENCE THAT STINGS US INTO BETTER STRIVING I AM SAVED FROM ROBBING OTHERS
248-130697-0011 SHE SPOKE HESITATINGLY I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THEM SAID DERONDA I WAS THINKING TOO MUCH OF THE OTHER THINGS PERHAPS YOU DON'T QUITE KNOW THE BEGINNING OF IT ALL SAID GWENDOLEN SLOWLY AS IF SHE WERE OVERCOMING HER RELUCTANCE
248-130697-0012 THERE WAS SOME ONE ELSE HE OUGHT TO HAVE MARRIED AND I KNEW IT AND I TOLD HER I WOULD NOT HINDER IT AND I WENT AWAY THAT WAS WHEN YOU FIRST SAW ME
248-130697-0013 BUT THEN WE BECAME POOR ALL AT ONCE AND I WAS VERY MISERABLE AND I WAS TEMPTED I THOUGHT I SHALL DO AS I LIKE AND MAKE EVERYTHING RIGHT I PERSUADED MYSELF AND IT WAS ALL DIFFERENT IT WAS ALL DREADFUL
248-130697-0014 THEN CAME HATRED AND WICKED THOUGHTS THAT WAS HOW IT ALL CAME I TOLD YOU I WAS AFRAID OF MYSELF
248-130697-0015 IF YOU DID NOT KNOW HOW MISERABLE I WAS YOU MIGHT BUT NOW IT HAS ALL BEEN NO USE I CAN CARE FOR NOTHING BUT SAVING THE REST FROM KNOWING POOR MAMMA
248-130697-0016 WORTH ANYTHING WORTHY ENOUGH I SHALL ALWAYS BE TOO WICKED TO THE VOICE BROKE OFF HELPLESS DERONDA'S HEART WAS PIERCED HE TURNED HIS EYES ON HER POOR BESEECHING FACE AND SAID
248-130697-0017 I BELIEVE THAT YOU MAY BECOME WORTHIER THAN YOU HAVE EVER YET BEEN WORTHY TO LEAD A LIFE THAT MAY BE A BLESSING NO EVIL DOOMS US HOPELESSLY EXCEPT THE EVIL WE LOVE AND DESIRE TO CONTINUE IN
248-130697-0018 AND MAKE NO EFFORT TO ESCAPE FROM YOU HAVE MADE EFFORTS YOU WILL GO ON MAKING THEM BUT YOU WERE THE BEGINNING OF THEM YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME SAID GWENDOLEN LEANING WITH HER CLASPED HANDS ON THE ARM OF HER CHAIR AND LOOKING AT HIM
248-130697-0019 WHILE HER FACE BORE PITEOUS TRACES OF THE LIFE EXPERIENCE CONCENTRATED IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS THAT NEW TERRIBLE LIFE LYING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEED WHICH FULFILLS A CRIMINAL DESIRE I WILL BEAR ANY PENANCE
248-130697-0020 I WILL LEAD ANY LIFE YOU TELL ME BUT YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME YOU MUST BE NEAR IF YOU HAD BEEN NEAR ME IF I COULD HAVE SAID EVERYTHING TO YOU I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT YOU WILL NOT FORSAKE ME
248-130697-0021 IT COULD NEVER BE MY IMPULSE TO FORSAKE YOU SAID DERONDA PROMPTLY WITH THAT VOICE WHICH LIKE HIS EYES HAD THE UNINTENTIONAL EFFECT OF MAKING HIS READY SYMPATHY SEEM MORE PERSONAL AND SPECIAL THAN IT REALLY WAS
248-130697-0022 AND IN THAT MOMENT HE WAS NOT HIMSELF QUITE FREE FROM A FOREBODING OF SOME SUCH SELF COMMITTING EFFECT HIS STRONG FEELING FOR THIS STRICKEN CREATURE COULD NOT HINDER RUSHING IMAGES OF FUTURE DIFFICULTY
248-130697-0023 TO AN INDEFINITE HOPE ANXIETIES BOTH IMMEDIATE AND DISTANT CROWDED ON HIS THOUGHT AND IT WAS UNDER THEIR INFLUENCE THAT AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE HE SAID
248-130697-0024 AND I AM NOT WITHOUT HOPE THAT MISSUS DAVILOW MAY SHORTLY FOLLOW HIM HER PRESENCE WILL BE THE GREATEST COMFORT TO YOU IT WILL GIVE YOU A MOTIVE TO SAVE HER FROM UNNECESSARY PAIN YES YES I WILL TRY AND YOU WILL NOT GO AWAY
248-130697-0025 NOT TILL AFTER SIR HUGO HAS COME BUT WE SHALL ALL GO TO ENGLAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SAID DERONDA NOT WISHING TO ENTER INTO PARTICULARS
248-130697-0026 GWENDOLEN LOOKED TOWARD THE WINDOW AGAIN WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH SEEMED LIKE A GRADUAL AWAKENING TO NEW THOUGHTS THE TWILIGHT WAS PERCEPTIBLY DEEPENING
248-130697-0027 OR ELSE AT DIPLOW I AM QUITE UNCERTAIN WHERE I SHALL LIVE SAID DERONDA COLORING SHE WAS WARNED BY HIS CHANGED COLOR THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN TOO RASHLY AND FELL SILENT
248-130697-0028 WHEN YOU ARE AMONG YOUR FRIENDS AGAIN YOU WILL DISCERN NEW DUTIES SAID DERONDA MAKE IT A TASK NOW TO GET AS WELL AND CALM AS MUCH LIKE YOURSELF AS YOU CAN BEFORE HE HESITATED
248-130697-0029 BEFORE MY MOTHER COMES SAID GWENDOLEN AH I MUST BE CHANGED I HAVE NOT LOOKED AT MYSELF SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME SHE ADDED TURNING TOWARD HIM IF YOU HAD MET ME NOW
248-130697-0030 SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME FOR THE ONE YOU SAW AT LEUBRONN YES I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU SAID DERONDA MOURNFULLY THE OUTSIDE CHANGE IS NOT GREAT I SHOULD HAVE SEEN AT ONCE THAT IT WAS YOU AND THAT YOU HAD GONE THROUGH SOME GREAT SORROW
248-130697-0031 DON'T WISH NOW THAT YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ME DON'T WISH THAT SAID GWENDOLEN IMPLORINGLY WHILE THE TEARS GATHERED I SHOULD DESPISE MYSELF FOR WISHING IT SAID DERONDA HOW COULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS WISHING
248-130697-0032 WE MUST FIND OUR DUTIES IN WHAT COMES TO US NOT IN WHAT WE IMAGINE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF I TOOK TO FOOLISH WISHING OF THAT SORT I SHOULD WISH NOT THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN YOU BUT THAT I HAD BEEN ABLE TO SAVE YOU FROM THIS
248-130697-0033 YOU HAVE SAVED ME FROM WORSE SAID GWENDOLEN IN A SOBBING VOICE
248-130697-0034 IT WILL BE BETTER FOR ME TO GO NOW SAID DERONDA WORN IN SPIRIT BY THE PERPETUAL STRAIN OF THIS SCENE REMEMBER WHAT WE SAID OF YOUR TASK TO GET WELL AND CALM BEFORE OTHER FRIENDS COME
248-130697-0035 HE ROSE AS HE SPOKE AND SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND SUBMISSIVELY BUT WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER SHE SANK ON HER KNEES IN HYSTERICAL CRYING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM WAS TOO GREAT
248-130697-0036 BEHOLDING A POSSIBLE LIFE WHICH SHE HAD SINNED HERSELF AWAY FROM
250-140277-0000 THIS BOOK OWES ITS ORIGIN TO THE FACT THAT IN THE AUTUMN OF NINETEEN TWENTY ONE THE AUTHORITIES OF MANCHESTER COLLEGE OXFORD INVITED ME TO DELIVER THE INAUGURAL COURSE OF A LECTURESHIP IN RELIGION NEWLY ESTABLISHED UNDER THE WILL OF THE LATE PROFESSOR UPTON
250-140277-0001 NO CONDITIONS BEING ATTACHED TO THIS APPOINTMENT IT SEEMED A SUITABLE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS SO FAR AS POSSIBLE IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE MOMENT SOME OF THE IMPLICITS WHICH I BELIEVE TO UNDERLIE HUMAN EFFORT
250-140277-0002 AND ACHIEVEMENT IN THE DOMAIN OF THE SPIRITUAL LIFE THE MATERIAL GATHERED FOR THIS PURPOSE HAS NOW BEEN ADDED TO REVISED AND TO SOME EXTENT RE WRITTEN
250-140277-0003 OR WHO ARE OFFENDED BY THE RESULTING DEMONSTRATIONS OF CONTINUITY BETWEEN OUR MOST HOMELY AND MOST LOFTY REACTIONS TO THE UNIVERSE MIGHT TAKE TO THEMSELVES THE PLAIN WORDS OF THOMAS A KEMPIS THOU ART A MAN AND NOT GOD THOU ART FLESH
250-140277-0004 AND NO ANGEL SINCE MY SUBJECT IS NOT THE SPLENDOR OF HISTORIC SANCTITY BUT THE NORMAL LIFE OF THE SPIRIT AS IT MAY BE AND IS LIVED IN THE HERE AND NOW
250-140277-0005 NO ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THOSE ABNORMAL EXPERIENCES AND STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH TOO OFTEN REGARDED AS SPECIALLY MYSTICAL ARE NOW RECOGNIZED BY ALL COMPETENT STUDENTS AS REPRESENTING THE UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENTS
250-140277-0006 RATHER THAN THE ABIDING SUBSTANCE OF SPIRITUALITY READERS OF THESE PAGES WILL FIND NOTHING ABOUT TRANCES ECSTASIES AND OTHER RARE PSYCHIC PHENOMENA WHICH SOMETIMES INDICATE HOLINESS AND SOMETIMES ONLY DISEASE
250-140277-0007 FOR INFORMATION ON THESE MATTERS THEY MUST GO TO LARGER AND MORE TECHNICAL WORKS MY AIM HERE IS THE MORE GENERAL ONE OF INDICATING FIRST THE CHARACTERISTIC EXPERIENCES DISCOVERABLE WITHIN ALL GREAT RELIGIONS
250-140277-0008 WHICH JUSTIFY OR ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO THE SPIRITUAL LIFE AND THE WAY IN WHICH THESE EXPERIENCES MAY BE ACCOMMODATED TO THE WORLD VIEW OF THE MODERN MAN AND NEXT THE NATURE OF THAT SPIRITUAL LIFE AS IT APPEARS IN HUMAN HISTORY
250-140277-0009 THE SUCCEEDING SECTIONS OF THE BOOK TREAT IN SOME DETAIL THE LIGHT CAST ON SPIRITUAL PROBLEMS BY MENTAL ANALYSIS A PROCESS WHICH NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE CONDUCTED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A DEGRADED MATERIALISM
250-140277-0010 AND BY RECENT WORK ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF AUTISTIC THOUGHT AND OF SUGGESTION THESE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE A PRACTICAL INTEREST FOR EVERY MAN WHO DESIRES TO BE THE CAPTAIN OF HIS SOUL
250-140277-0011 THE RELATION IN WHICH INSTITUTIONAL RELIGION DOES OR SHOULD STAND TO THE SPIRITUAL LIFE IS ALSO IN PART A MATTER FOR PSYCHOLOGY WHICH IS HERE CALLED UPON TO DEAL WITH THE RELIGIOUS ASPECT OF THE SOCIAL INSTINCTS
250-140277-0012 AND THE PROBLEMS SURROUNDING SYMBOLS AND CULTS THESE CHAPTERS LEAD UP TO A DISCUSSION OF THE PERSONAL ASPECT OF THE SPIRITUAL LIFE ITS CURVE OF GROWTH CHARACTERS AND ACTIVITIES
250-140277-0013 AND A FURTHER SECTION SUGGESTS SOME WAYS IN WHICH EDUCATIONISTS MIGHT PROMOTE THE UP SPRINGING OF THIS LIFE IN THE YOUNG FINALLY THE LAST CHAPTER ATTEMPTS TO PLACE THE FACT OF THE LIFE OF THE SPIRIT IN ITS RELATION TO THE SOCIAL ORDER
250-140277-0014 AND TO INDICATE SOME OF THE RESULTS WHICH MIGHT FOLLOW UPON ITS HEALTHY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT IT IS SUPERFLUOUS TO POINT OUT THAT EACH OF THESE SUBJECTS NEEDS AT LEAST A VOLUME TO ITSELF
250-140277-0015 WARM GRATITUDE FIRST TO THE PRINCIPAL AND AUTHORITIES OF MANCHESTER COLLEGE WHO GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY OF DELIVERING THESE CHAPTERS IN THEIR ORIGINAL FORM AND WHOSE UNFAILING SYMPATHY AND KINDNESS SO GREATLY HELPED ME
250-140277-0016 PSYCHOLOGY AND THE LIFE OF THE SPIRIT TWO CONTEMPLATION AND SUGGESTION
250-142276-0000 CHAPTER TWO ROSES AND THORNS BY THE SOFT GREEN LIGHT IN THE WOODY GLADE ON THE BANKS OF MOSS WHERE THY CHILDHOOD PLAYED BY THE HOUSEHOLD TREE
250-142276-0001 HER MOTHER HAD BEEN DETAINED AT HOME BY A MULTITUDE OF HALF REASONS NONE OF WHICH ANYBODY FULLY UNDERSTOOD EXCEPT MISTER HALE WHO WAS PERFECTLY AWARE THAT ALL HIS ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF A GREY SATIN GOWN
250-142276-0002 WHICH WAS MIDWAY BETWEEN OLDNESS AND NEWNESS HAD PROVED UNAVAILING AND THAT AS HE HAD NOT THE MONEY TO EQUIP HIS WIFE AFRESH FROM TOP TO TOE SHE WOULD NOT SHOW HERSELF AT HER ONLY SISTER'S ONLY CHILD'S WEDDING
250-142276-0003 IF MISSUS SHAW HAD GUESSED AT THE REAL REASON WHY MISSUS HALE DID NOT ACCOMPANY HER HUSBAND SHE WOULD HAVE SHOWERED DOWN GOWNS UPON HER BUT IT WAS NEARLY TWENTY YEARS SINCE MISSUS SHAW HAD BEEN THE POOR PRETTY MISS BERESFORD
250-142276-0004 AND SHE HAD REALLY FORGOTTEN ALL GRIEVANCES EXCEPT THAT OF THE UNHAPPINESS ARISING FROM DISPARITY OF AGE IN MARRIED LIFE ON WHICH SHE COULD DESCANT BY THE HALF HOUR DEAREST MARIA HAD MARRIED THE MAN OF HER HEART
250-142276-0005 ONLY EIGHT YEARS OLDER THAN HERSELF WITH THE SWEETEST TEMPER AND THAT BLUE BLACK HAIR ONE SO SELDOM SEES MISTER HALE WAS ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL PREACHERS SHE HAD EVER HEARD AND A PERFECT MODEL OF A PARISH PRIEST
250-142276-0006 PERHAPS IT WAS NOT QUITE A LOGICAL DEDUCTION FROM ALL THESE PREMISES BUT IT WAS STILL MISSUS SHAW'S CHARACTERISTIC CONCLUSION AS SHE THOUGHT OVER HER SISTER'S LOT
250-142276-0007 MISSUS HALE IF SHE SPOKE TRUTH MIGHT HAVE ANSWERED WITH A READY MADE LIST
250-142276-0008 A WHITE CHIP BONNET OH DOZENS OF THINGS FOR THE WEDDING AND HUNDREDS OF THINGS FOR THE HOUSE MARGARET ONLY KNEW THAT HER MOTHER HAD NOT FOUND IT CONVENIENT TO COME
250-142276-0009 AND SHE WAS NOT SORRY TO THINK THAT THEIR MEETING AND GREETING WOULD TAKE PLACE AT HELSTONE PARSONAGE RATHER THAN DURING THE CONFUSION OF THE LAST TWO OR THREE DAYS IN THE HOUSE IN HARLEY STREET WHERE SHE HERSELF HAD HAD TO PLAY THE PART OF FIGARO
250-142276-0010 AND WAS WANTED EVERYWHERE AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME HER MIND AND BODY ACHED NOW WITH THE RECOLLECTION OF ALL SHE HAD DONE AND SAID WITHIN THE LAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS THE FAREWELLS SO HURRIEDLY TAKEN AMONGST ALL THE OTHER GOOD BYES
250-142276-0011 OF THOSE SHE HAD LIVED WITH SO LONG OPPRESSED HER NOW WITH A SAD REGRET FOR THE TIMES THAT WERE NO MORE IT DID NOT SIGNIFY WHAT THOSE TIMES HAD BEEN THEY WERE GONE NEVER TO RETURN MARGARET'S HEART FELT MORE HEAVY
250-142276-0012 THE PLACE AND THE LIFE SHE HAD LONGED FOR FOR YEARS AT THAT TIME OF ALL TIMES FOR YEARNING AND LONGING JUST BEFORE THE SHARP SENSES LOSE THEIR OUTLINES IN SLEEP
250-142276-0013 HER DEAR FATHER LEANING BACK ASLEEP IN THE RAILWAY CARRIAGE HIS BLUE BLACK HAIR WAS GREY NOW AND LAY THINLY OVER HIS BROWS THE BONES OF HIS FACE WERE PLAINLY TO BE SEEN
250-142276-0014 TOO PLAINLY FOR BEAUTY IF HIS FEATURES HAD BEEN LESS FINELY CUT AS IT WAS THEY HAD A GRACE IF NOT A COMELINESS OF THEIR OWN THE FACE WAS IN REPOSE BUT IT WAS RATHER REST AFTER WEARINESS
250-142276-0015 THAN THE SERENE CALM OF THE COUNTENANCE OF ONE WHO LED A PLACID CONTENTED LIFE MARGARET WAS PAINFULLY STRUCK BY THE WORN ANXIOUS EXPRESSION AND SHE WENT BACK OVER THE OPEN AND AVOWED CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER FATHER'S LIFE
250-142276-0016 TO FIND THE CAUSE FOR THE LINES THAT SPOKE SO PLAINLY OF HABITUAL DISTRESS AND DEPRESSION POOR FREDERICK THOUGHT SHE SIGHING OH IF FREDERICK HAD BUT BEEN A CLERGYMAN INSTEAD OF GOING INTO THE NAVY AND BEING LOST TO US ALL
250-142276-0017 I WISH I KNEW ALL ABOUT IT I NEVER UNDERSTOOD IT FROM AUNT SHAW I ONLY KNEW HE COULD NOT COME BACK TO ENGLAND BECAUSE OF THAT TERRIBLE AFFAIR POOR DEAR PAPA HOW SAD HE LOOKS
250-142276-0018 I AM SO GLAD I AM GOING HOME TO BE AT HAND TO COMFORT HIM AND MAMMA SHE WAS READY WITH A BRIGHT SMILE IN WHICH THERE WAS NOT A TRACE OF FATIGUE TO GREET HER FATHER WHEN HE AWAKENED HE SMILED BACK AGAIN BUT
250-142276-0019 FAINTLY AS IF IT WERE AN UNUSUAL EXERTION HIS FACE RETURNED INTO ITS LINES OF HABITUAL ANXIETY HE HAD A TRICK OF HALF OPENING HIS MOUTH AS IF TO SPEAK WHICH CONSTANTLY UNSETTLED THE FORM OF THE LIPS
250-142276-0020 AND GAVE THE FACE AN UNDECIDED EXPRESSION BUT HE HAD THE SAME LARGE SOFT EYES AS HIS DAUGHTER EYES WHICH MOVED SLOWLY AND ALMOST GRANDLY ROUND IN THEIR ORBITS AND WERE WELL VEILED BY THEIR TRANSPARENT WHITE EYELIDS
250-142276-0021 NO ROSEBUD THAT COULD ONLY OPEN JUST ENOUGH TO LET OUT A YES AND NO AND AN'T PLEASE YOU SIR BUT THE WIDE MOUTH WAS ONE SOFT CURVE OF RICH RED LIPS AND THE SKIN IF NOT WHITE AND FAIR
250-142276-0022 WAS OF AN IVORY SMOOTHNESS AND DELICACY IF THE LOOK ON HER FACE WAS IN GENERAL TOO DIGNIFIED AND RESERVED FOR ONE SO YOUNG NOW TALKING TO HER FATHER IT WAS BRIGHT AS THE MORNING
250-142276-0023 FULL OF DIMPLES AND GLANCES THAT SPOKE OF CHILDISH GLADNESS AND BOUNDLESS HOPE IN THE FUTURE IT WAS THE LATTER PART OF JULY WHEN MARGARET RETURNED HOME THE FOREST TREES WERE ALL ONE DARK FULL DUSKY GREEN
250-142276-0024 THE FERN BELOW THEM CAUGHT ALL THE SLANTING SUNBEAMS THE WEATHER WAS SULTRY AND BROODINGLY STILL MARGARET USED TO TRAMP ALONG BY HER FATHER'S SIDE CRUSHING DOWN THE FERN WITH A CRUEL GLEE
250-142276-0025 AS SHE FELT IT YIELD UNDER HER LIGHT FOOT AND SEND UP THE FRAGRANCE PECULIAR TO IT OUT ON THE BROAD COMMONS INTO THE WARM SCENTED LIGHT SEEING MULTITUDES OF WILD FREE LIVING CREATURES REVELLING IN THE SUNSHINE
250-142276-0026 THIS LIFE AT LEAST THESE WALKS REALISED ALL MARGARET'S ANTICIPATIONS SHE TOOK A PRIDE IN HER FOREST ITS PEOPLE WERE HER PEOPLE SHE MADE HEARTY FRIENDS WITH THEM
250-142276-0027 LEARNED AND DELIGHTED IN USING THEIR PECULIAR WORDS TOOK UP HER FREEDOM AMONGST THEM NURSED THEIR BABIES TALKED OR READ WITH SLOW DISTINCTNESS TO THEIR OLD PEOPLE
250-142276-0028 CARRIED DAINTY MESSES TO THEIR SICK RESOLVED BEFORE LONG TO TEACH AT THE SCHOOL WHERE HER FATHER WENT EVERY DAY AS TO AN APPOINTED TASK BUT SHE WAS CONTINUALLY TEMPTED OFF TO GO AND SEE SOME INDIVIDUAL FRIEND
250-142276-0029 MAN WOMAN OR CHILD IN SOME COTTAGE IN THE GREEN SHADE OF THE FOREST HER OUT OF DOORS LIFE WAS PERFECT HER IN DOORS LIFE HAD ITS DRAWBACKS
250-142276-0030 WITH THE HEALTHY SHAME OF A CHILD SHE BLAMED HERSELF FOR HER KEENNESS OF SIGHT IN PERCEIVING THAT ALL WAS NOT AS IT SHOULD BE THERE HER MOTHER HER MOTHER ALWAYS SO KIND AND TENDER TOWARDS HER
250-142276-0031 BUT EVERY DAY HE WAS MORE OVERPOWERED THE WORLD BECAME MORE BEWILDERING AT EACH REPEATED URGENCY OF HIS WIFE THAT HE WOULD PUT HIMSELF IN THE WAY OF SEEKING SOME PREFERMENT
250-142276-0032 AND MARGARET WOULD TRY TO TEMPT HER FORTH ON TO THE BEAUTIFUL BROAD UPLAND SUN STREAKED CLOUD SHADOWED COMMON FOR SHE WAS SURE THAT HER MOTHER HAD ACCUSTOMED HERSELF TOO MUCH TO AN IN DOORS LIFE SELDOM EXTENDING HER WALKS BEYOND THE CHURCH
250-142276-0033 THE SCHOOL AND THE NEIGHBOURING COTTAGES THIS DID GOOD FOR A TIME BUT WHEN THE AUTUMN DREW ON AND THE WEATHER BECAME MORE CHANGEABLE HER MOTHER'S IDEA OF THE UNHEALTHINESS OF THE PLACE INCREASED
250-142276-0034 AND SHE REPINED EVEN MORE FREQUENTLY THAT HER HUSBAND WHO WAS MORE LEARNED THAN MISTER HUME A BETTER PARISH PRIEST THAN MISTER HOULDSWORTH SHOULD NOT HAVE MET WITH THE PREFERMENT THAT THESE TWO FORMER NEIGHBOURS OF THEIRS HAD DONE
250-142276-0035 THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP MANY LUXURIES WHICH HAD ONLY BEEN TROUBLES AND TRAMMELS TO HER FREEDOM IN HARLEY STREET HER KEEN ENJOYMENT OF EVERY SENSUOUS PLEASURE WAS BALANCED FINELY IF NOT OVERBALANCED
250-142276-0036 BY HER CONSCIOUS PRIDE IN BEING ABLE TO DO WITHOUT THEM ALL IF NEED WERE BUT THE CLOUD NEVER COMES IN THAT QUARTER OF THE HORIZON FROM WHICH WE WATCH FOR IT THERE HAD BEEN SLIGHT COMPLAINTS AND PASSING REGRETS ON HER MOTHER'S PART
250-142276-0037 NOT SO PLEASANT IN THE LATTER HALF OF SEPTEMBER THE AUTUMNAL RAINS AND STORMS CAME ON AND MARGARET WAS OBLIGED TO REMAIN MORE IN THE HOUSE THAN SHE HAD HITHERTO DONE
250-142276-0038 HELSTONE WAS AT SOME DISTANCE FROM ANY NEIGHBOURS OF THEIR OWN STANDARD OF CULTIVATION IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE MOST OUT OF THE WAY PLACES IN ENGLAND SAID MISSUS HALE IN ONE OF HER PLAINTIVE MOODS
250-142276-0039 IF WE ONLY LIVED AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PARISH IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THERE WE SHOULD BE ALMOST WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF THE STANSFIELDS CERTAINLY THE GORMANS WOULD BE WITHIN A WALK GORMANS SAID MARGARET
250-142276-0040 ARE THOSE THE GORMANS WHO MADE THEIR FORTUNES IN TRADE AT SOUTHAMPTON OH I'M GLAD WE DON'T VISIT THEM I DON'T LIKE SHOPPY PEOPLE I THINK WE ARE FAR BETTER OFF KNOWING ONLY COTTAGERS AND LABOURERS
250-142276-0041 I CALL MINE A VERY COMPREHENSIVE TASTE I LIKE ALL PEOPLE WHOSE OCCUPATIONS HAVE TO DO WITH LAND I LIKE SOLDIERS AND SAILORS AND THE THREE LEARNED PROFESSIONS AS THEY CALL THEM
250-142276-0042 AND WITH THE SOFT VIOLENCE OF THE WEST WIND BEHIND HER AS SHE CROSSED SOME HEATH SHE SEEMED TO BE BORNE ONWARDS AS LIGHTLY AND EASILY AS THE FALLEN LEAF THAT WAS WAFTED ALONG BY THE AUTUMNAL BREEZE
250-142276-0043 BUT THE EVENINGS WERE RATHER DIFFICULT TO FILL UP AGREEABLY IMMEDIATELY AFTER TEA HER FATHER WITHDREW INTO HIS SMALL LIBRARY AND SHE AND HER MOTHER WERE LEFT ALONE MISSUS HALE HAD NEVER CARED MUCH FOR BOOKS
250-142276-0044 AND HAD DISCOURAGED HER HUSBAND VERY EARLY IN THEIR MARRIED LIFE IN HIS DESIRE OF READING ALOUD TO HER WHILE SHE WORKED AT ONE TIME THEY HAD TRIED BACKGAMMON AS A RESOURCE BUT AS MISTER HALE GREW TO TAKE AN INCREASING INTEREST IN HIS SCHOOL AND HIS PARISHIONERS
250-142276-0045 HE FOUND THAT THE INTERRUPTIONS WHICH AROSE OUT OF THESE DUTIES WERE REGARDED AS HARDSHIPS BY HIS WIFE NOT TO BE ACCEPTED AS THE NATURAL CONDITIONS OF HIS PROFESSION BUT TO BE REGRETTED AND STRUGGLED AGAINST BY HER AS THEY SEVERALLY AROSE
250-142276-0046 SO HE WITHDREW WHILE THE CHILDREN WERE YET YOUNG INTO HIS LIBRARY TO SPEND HIS EVENINGS IF HE WERE AT HOME IN READING THE SPECULATIVE AND METAPHYSICAL BOOKS WHICH WERE HIS DELIGHT
250-142276-0047 WHEN MARGARET HAD BEEN HERE BEFORE SHE HAD BROUGHT DOWN WITH HER A GREAT BOX OF BOOKS RECOMMENDED BY MASTERS OR GOVERNESS AND HAD FOUND THE SUMMER'S DAY ALL TOO SHORT TO GET THROUGH THE READING SHE HAD TO DO BEFORE HER RETURN TO TOWN
250-142276-0048 NOW THERE WERE ONLY THE WELL BOUND LITTLE READ ENGLISH CLASSICS WHICH WERE WEEDED OUT OF HER FATHER'S LIBRARY TO FILL UP THE SMALL BOOK SHELVES IN THE DRAWING ROOM THOMSON'S SEASONS HAYLEY'S COWPER MIDDLETON'S CICERO
250-142276-0049 WERE BY FAR THE LIGHTEST NEWEST AND MOST AMUSING THE BOOK SHELVES DID NOT AFFORD MUCH RESOURCE MARGARET TOLD HER MOTHER EVERY PARTICULAR OF HER LONDON LIFE TO ALL OF WHICH MISSUS HALE LISTENED WITH INTEREST
250-142276-0050 SOMETIMES AMUSED AND QUESTIONING AT OTHERS A LITTLE INCLINED TO COMPARE HER SISTER'S CIRCUMSTANCES OF EASE AND COMFORT WITH THE NARROWER MEANS AT HELSTONE VICARAGE ON SUCH EVENINGS MARGARET WAS APT TO STOP TALKING RATHER ABRUPTLY
250-142276-0051 ONCE OR TWICE MARGARET FOUND HERSELF MECHANICALLY COUNTING THE REPETITION OF THE MONOTONOUS SOUND WHILE SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT VENTURE TO PUT A QUESTION ON A SUBJECT VERY NEAR TO HER HEART AND ASK WHERE FREDERICK WAS NOW
250-142276-0052 THE FULL ACCOUNT OF WHICH MARGARET HAD NEVER HEARD AND WHICH NOW SEEMED DOOMED TO BE BURIED IN SAD OBLIVION
250-142276-0053 WHEN SHE WAS WITH HER MOTHER HER FATHER SEEMED THE BEST PERSON TO APPLY TO FOR INFORMATION AND WHEN WITH HIM
250-142276-0054 HIS ROOM WAS KEPT EXACTLY AS HE HAD LEFT IT AND WAS REGULARLY DUSTED AND PUT INTO ORDER BY DIXON MISSUS HALE'S MAID WHO TOUCHED NO OTHER PART OF THE HOUSEHOLD WORK
250-142276-0055 BUT ALWAYS REMEMBERED THE DAY WHEN SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED BY LADY BERESFORD AS LADIES MAID TO SIR JOHN'S WARDS THE PRETTY MISS BERESFORDS THE BELLES OF RUTLANDSHIRE
250-142276-0056 ALIAS HER MARRIED LIFE SHE REMAINED WITH HER AND WAS DEVOTED TO HER INTERESTS ALWAYS CONSIDERING HERSELF AS THE GOOD AND PROTECTING FAIRY WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO BAFFLE THE MALIGNANT GIANT MISTER HALE
250-142276-0057 HE WOULD BE DEPRESSED FOR MANY DAYS AFTER WITNESSING A DEATH BED OR HEARING OF ANY CRIME BUT NOW MARGARET NOTICED AN ABSENCE OF MIND AS IF HIS THOUGHTS WERE PRE OCCUPIED BY SOME SUBJECT
250-142276-0058 THE OPPRESSION OF WHICH COULD NOT BE RELIEVED BY ANY DAILY ACTION SUCH AS COMFORTING THE SURVIVORS OR TEACHING AT THE SCHOOL IN HOPE OF LESSENING THE EVILS IN THE GENERATION TO COME MISTER HALE DID NOT GO OUT AMONG HIS PARISHIONERS AS MUCH AS USUAL
250-142276-0059 A SIGNAL WHICH AT ONE TIME HAD OFTEN TO BE REPEATED BEFORE ANY ONE WAS SUFFICIENTLY ALIVE TO THE HOUR OF THE DAY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS AND ATTEND TO HIM NOW MISTER HALE LOITERED ABOUT THE GARDEN IF THE MORNING WAS FINE AND IF NOT
250-142276-0060 HALF CONFIDENTIAL SHAKE OF THE HEAD TO THE PARSON WHO WATCHED HIM AWAY BEYOND THE SWEET BRIAR HEDGE AND PAST THE GREAT ARBUTUS BEFORE HE TURNED INTO THE ROOM TO BEGIN HIS DAY'S WORK WITH ALL THE SIGNS OF A HEAVY HEART
250-142276-0061 NOT ABSOLUTELY BASED ON A KNOWLEDGE OF FACTS IS EASILY BANISHED FOR A TIME BY A BRIGHT SUNNY DAY OR SOME HAPPY OUTWARD CIRCUMSTANCE AND WHEN THE BRILLIANT FOURTEEN FINE DAYS OF OCTOBER CAME ON
250-142276-0062 SHE HAD LEARNT DRAWING WITH EDITH AND SHE HAD SUFFICIENTLY REGRETTED DURING THE GLOOM OF THE BAD WEATHER HER IDLE REVELLING IN THE BEAUTY OF THE WOODLANDS WHILE IT HAD YET BEEN FINE TO MAKE HER DETERMINED TO SKETCH WHAT SHE COULD
250-142276-0063 BEFORE WINTER FAIRLY SET IN ACCORDINGLY SHE WAS BUSY PREPARING HER BOARD ONE MORNING WHEN SARAH THE HOUSEMAID THREW WIDE OPEN THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR AND ANNOUNCED
250-142286-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE MORNING CALLS WELL I SUPPOSE WE MUST FRIENDS IN COUNCIL
250-142286-0001 MISTER THORNTON HAD HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN WORKING UP HIS MOTHER TO THE DESIRED POINT OF CIVILITY SHE DID NOT OFTEN MAKE CALLS AND WHEN SHE DID IT WAS IN HEAVY STATE THAT SHE WENT THROUGH HER DUTIES
250-142286-0002 BUT SHE REFUSED TO LET HIM KEEP HORSES FOR IT THEY WERE HIRED FOR THE SOLEMN OCCASIONS WHEN SHE PAID MORNING OR EVENING VISITS SHE HAD HAD HORSES FOR THREE DAYS NOT A FORTNIGHT BEFORE
250-142286-0003 WHO MIGHT NOW PUT THEMSELVES TO TROUBLE AND EXPENSE IN THEIR TURN YET CRAMPTON WAS TOO FAR OFF FOR HER TO WALK AND SHE HAD REPEATEDLY QUESTIONED HER SON AS TO WHETHER HIS WISH THAT SHE SHOULD CALL ON THE HALES WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR THE EXPENSE OF CAB HIRE
250-142286-0004 THE LAST TIME YOU WERE OUT IN A CAB YOU CAME HOME WITH A HEADACHE FROM THE JOLTING I NEVER COMPLAINED OF IT I'M SURE NO
250-142286-0005 BUT SO MUCH THE MORE I HAVE TO WATCH OVER YOU NOW AS FOR FANNY THERE A LITTLE HARDSHIP WOULD DO HER GOOD SHE IS NOT MADE OF THE SAME STUFF AS YOU ARE JOHN SHE COULD NOT BEAR IT
250-142286-0006 MISSUS THORNTON WAS SILENT AFTER THIS FOR HER LAST WORDS BORE RELATION TO A SUBJECT WHICH MORTIFIED HER SHE HAD AN UNCONSCIOUS CONTEMPT FOR A WEAK CHARACTER AND FANNY WAS WEAK IN THE VERY POINTS IN WHICH HER MOTHER AND BROTHER WERE STRONG
250-142286-0007 MISSUS THORNTON WAS NOT A WOMAN MUCH GIVEN TO REASONING HER QUICK JUDGMENT AND FIRM RESOLUTION SERVED HER IN GOOD STEAD OF ANY LONG ARGUMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH HERSELF SHE FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT NOTHING COULD STRENGTHEN FANNY TO ENDURE HARDSHIPS PATIENTLY
250-142286-0008 WHICH THE UNEASY TENDERNESS OF MISSUS THORNTON'S MANNER TO HER DAUGHTER THE SHAME WITH WHICH SHE THOUGHT TO HIDE THE POVERTY OF HER CHILD IN ALL THE GRAND QUALITIES WHICH SHE HERSELF POSSESSED UNCONSCIOUSLY AND WHICH SHE SET SO HIGH A VALUE UPON IN OTHERS
250-142286-0009 THIS SHAME I SAY BETRAYED THE WANT OF A SECURE RESTING PLACE FOR HER AFFECTION SHE NEVER CALLED HER SON BY ANY NAME BUT JOHN LOVE AND DEAR AND SUCH LIKE TERMS WERE RESERVED FOR FANNY
250-142286-0010 BUT HER HEART GAVE THANKS FOR HIM DAY AND NIGHT AND SHE WALKED PROUDLY AMONG WOMEN FOR HIS SAKE FANNY DEAR I SHALL HAVE HORSES TO THE CARRIAGE TO DAY TO GO AND CALL ON THESE HALES
250-142286-0011 WITH WHAT ASKED MISSUS THORNTON HER BROW SLIGHTLY CONTRACTING
250-142286-0012 MISSUS THORNTON DID NOT SPEAK BUT SHE LAID HER WORK ON THE TABLE AND SEEMED TO THINK IT WILL BE A LONG WAY FOR HER TO WALK BACK AT NIGHT
250-142286-0013 AT THIS POINT MISTER THORNTON CAME IN JUST BEFORE GOING TO THE MILL MOTHER I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT IF THERE IS ANY LITTLE THING THAT COULD SERVE MISSUS HALE AS AN INVALID YOU WILL OFFER IT I'M SURE IF I CAN FIND IT OUT I WILL
250-142286-0014 IT WILL DO YOU GOOD INSTEAD OF HARM
250-142286-0015 HE WENT ABRUPTLY OUT OF THE ROOM AFTER SAYING THIS IF HE HAD STAID A MINUTE LONGER FANNY WOULD HAVE CRIED AT HIS TONE OF COMMAND EVEN WHEN HE USED THE WORDS YOU WILL OBLIGE ME
250-142286-0016 FANNY DON'T SPEAK SO OF YOUR BROTHER HE HAS GOOD REASONS OF SOME KIND OR OTHER OR HE WOULD NOT WISH US TO GO MAKE HASTE AND PUT YOUR THINGS ON
250-142286-0017 BUT THE LITTLE ALTERCATION BETWEEN HER SON AND HER DAUGHTER DID NOT INCLINE MISSUS THORNTON MORE FAVOURABLY TOWARDS THESE HALES HER JEALOUS HEART REPEATED HER DAUGHTER'S QUESTION
250-142286-0018 MISSUS THORNTON WAS SHY IT WAS ONLY OF LATE YEARS THAT SHE HAD HAD LEISURE ENOUGH IN HER LIFE TO GO INTO SOCIETY AND AS SOCIETY SHE DID NOT ENJOY IT
250-142286-0019 AS DINNER GIVING AND AS CRITICISING OTHER PEOPLE'S DINNERS SHE TOOK SATISFACTION IN IT BUT THIS GOING TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH STRANGERS WAS A VERY DIFFERENT THING
250-142286-0020 AS MISSUS THORNTON OBSERVED TO HERSELF SHE LIKED MISSUS HALE'S DOUBLE KNITTING FAR BETTER THAT WAS SENSIBLE OF ITS KIND THE ROOM ALTOGETHER WAS FULL OF KNICK KNACKS WHICH MUST TAKE A LONG TIME TO DUST AND TIME TO PEOPLE OF LIMITED INCOME WAS MONEY
250-142286-0021 MISSUS HALE WAS MAKING RATHER MORE EXERTION IN HER ANSWERS CAPTIVATED BY SOME REAL OLD LACE WHICH MISSUS THORNTON WORE LACE AS SHE AFTERWARDS OBSERVED TO DIXON OF THAT OLD ENGLISH POINT WHICH HAS NOT BEEN MADE FOR THIS SEVENTY YEARS AND
250-142286-0022 WHICH CANNOT BE BOUGHT IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN HEIR LOOM AND SHOWS THAT SHE HAD ANCESTORS SO THE OWNER OF THE ANCESTRAL LACE BECAME WORTHY OF SOMETHING MORE THAN THE LANGUID EXERTION TO BE AGREEABLE TO A VISITOR
250-142286-0023 FIFTEEN SHILLINGS A WEEK AND THREE SAVED OUT OF THEM THOUGHT MARGARET TO HERSELF BUT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY YOUNG SHE PROBABLY HAS FORGOTTEN HER OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE BUT SHE MUST KNOW OF THOSE DAYS
250-142286-0024 MARGARET'S MANNER HAD AN EXTRA TINGE OF COLDNESS IN IT WHEN SHE NEXT SPOKE YOU HAVE GOOD CONCERTS HERE I BELIEVE
250-142286-0025 TOO CROWDED THAT IS THE WORST
250-142286-0026 BUT SURELY IT IS A VERY EASY JOURNEY TO LONDON YES BUT SOMEHOW SAID FANNY LOWERING HER VOICE MAMMA HAS NEVER BEEN TO LONDON HERSELF AND CAN'T UNDERSTAND MY LONGING
250-142286-0027 MAY I INQUIRE MARGARET HAD NOT THE WORDS READY FOR AN ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WHICH TOOK HER A LITTLE BY SURPRISE SO MISS THORNTON REPLIED
250-142286-0028 AS FANNY HAD PUT IT IT DID SEEM AS IF THEY HAD BEEN IMPERTINENTLY DISCUSSING MISSUS THORNTON'S FEELINGS BUT SHE ALSO ROSE UP AGAINST THAT LADY'S MANNER OF SHOWING THAT SHE WAS OFFENDED MISSUS THORNTON WENT ON AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE
250-142286-0029 DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF MILTON MISS HALE HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF OUR FACTORIES OUR MAGNIFICENT WAREHOUSES NO SAID MARGARET I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING OF THAT DESCRIPTION AS YET
250-142286-0030 THEN SHE FELT THAT BY CONCEALING HER UTTER INDIFFERENCE TO ALL SUCH PLACES SHE WAS HARDLY SPEAKING WITH TRUTH SO SHE WENT ON
250-142286-0031 EVERY IMPROVEMENT OF MACHINERY IS I BELIEVE TO BE SEEN THERE IN ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION I AM SO GLAD YOU DON'T LIKE MILLS AND MANUFACTORIES AND ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS SAID FANNY IN A HALF WHISPER
250-142286-0032 SHE WILL DO YOU NO GOOD I SEE THE MOTHER LOOKS VERY ILL AND SEEMS A NICE QUIET KIND OF PERSON
2514-149482-0000 HE RECEIVED FROM MISSUS LOWDER ON THE MORNING AFTER HIS VISIT TO KATE THE TELEGRAPHIC EXPRESSION OF A HOPE THAT HE MIGHT BE FREE TO DINE WITH THEM THAT EVENING AND HIS FREEDOM AFFECTED HIM AS FORTUNATE EVEN THOUGH IN SOME DEGREE QUALIFIED BY HER MISSIVE
2514-149482-0001 EXPECTING AMERICAN FRIENDS WHOM I'M SO GLAD TO FIND YOU KNOW HIS KNOWLEDGE OF AMERICAN FRIENDS WAS CLEARLY AN ACCIDENT OF WHICH HE WAS TO TASTE THE FRUIT TO THE LAST BITTERNESS THIS APPREHENSION HOWEVER WE HASTEN TO ADD
2514-149482-0002 ENJOYED FOR HIM IN THE IMMEDIATE EVENT A CERTAIN MERCIFUL SHRINKAGE THE IMMEDIATE EVENT BEING THAT AT LANCASTER GATE FIVE MINUTES AFTER HIS DUE ARRIVAL PRESCRIBED HIM FOR EIGHT THIRTY MISSUS STRINGHAM CAME IN ALONE
2514-149482-0003 THE LONG DAYLIGHT THE POSTPONED LAMPS THE HABIT OF THE HOUR MADE DINNERS LATE AND GUESTS STILL LATER SO THAT PUNCTUAL AS HE WAS HE HAD FOUND MISSUS LOWDER ALONE WITH KATE HERSELF NOT YET IN THE FIELD
2514-149482-0004 HE HAD THUS HAD WITH HER SEVERAL BEWILDERING MOMENTS BEWILDERING BY REASON FAIRLY OF THEIR TACIT INVITATION TO HIM TO BE SUPERNATURALLY SIMPLE THIS WAS EXACTLY GOODNESS KNEW WHAT HE WANTED TO BE
2514-149482-0005 BUT HE HAD NEVER HAD IT SO LARGELY AND FREELY SO SUPERNATURALLY SIMPLY FOR THAT MATTER IMPUTED TO HIM AS OF EASY ACHIEVEMENT IT WAS A PARTICULAR IN WHICH AUNT MAUD APPEARED TO OFFER HERSELF AS AN EXAMPLE APPEARED TO SAY QUITE AGREEABLY
2514-149482-0006 WHAT I WANT OF YOU DON'T YOU SEE IS TO BE JUST EXACTLY AS I AM THE QUANTITY OF THE ARTICLE REQUIRED WAS WHAT MIGHT ESPECIALLY HAVE CAUSED HIM TO STAGGER HE LIKED SO IN GENERAL THE QUANTITIES IN WHICH MISSUS LOWDER DEALT
2514-149482-0007 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED AS WELL TO ASK HER HOW FEASIBLE SHE SUPPOSED IT FOR A POOR YOUNG MAN TO RESEMBLE HER AT ANY POINT BUT HE HAD AFTER ALL SOON ENOUGH PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS DOING AS SHE WISHED BY LETTING HIS WONDER SHOW
2514-149482-0008 JUST A LITTLE AS SILLY HE WAS CONSCIOUS MOREOVER OF A SMALL STRANGE DREAD OF THE RESULTS OF DISCUSSION WITH HER STRANGE TRULY BECAUSE IT WAS HER GOOD NATURE NOT HER ASPERITY THAT HE FEARED ASPERITY MIGHT HAVE MADE HIM ANGRY
2514-149482-0009 IN WHICH THERE WAS ALWAYS A COMFORT GOOD NATURE IN HIS CONDITIONS HAD A TENDENCY TO MAKE HIM ASHAMED WHICH AUNT MAUD INDEED WONDERFULLY LIKING HIM FOR HIMSELF QUITE STRUCK HIM AS HAVING GUESSED TO SPARE HIM THEREFORE SHE ALSO AVOIDED DISCUSSION
2514-149482-0010 SHE KEPT HIM DOWN BY REFUSING TO QUARREL WITH HIM THIS WAS WHAT SHE NOW PROPOSED TO HIM TO ENJOY AND HIS SECRET DISCOMFORT WAS HIS SENSE THAT ON THE WHOLE IT WAS WHAT WOULD BEST SUIT HIM BEING KEPT DOWN WAS A BORE BUT
2514-149482-0011 HIS GREAT DREAD VERILY WAS OF BEING ASHAMED WHICH WAS A THING DISTINCT AND IT MATTERED BUT LITTLE THAT HE WAS ASHAMED OF THAT TOO IT WAS OF THE ESSENCE OF HIS POSITION THAT IN SUCH A HOUSE AS THIS THE TABLES COULD ALWAYS BE TURNED ON HIM
2514-149482-0012 THE PLACE HOWEVER MUFFLED IN CONVENIENCE AND DECORUM CONSTANTLY HUMMED FOR HIM WITH THAT THICK IRONY
2514-149482-0013 AND HE HAD ALREADY SEEN HOW LITTLE AID CAME TO HIM FROM DENOUNCING THE BRIBES AS UGLY IN FORM THAT WAS WHAT THE PRECIOUS METALS THEY ALONE COULD AFFORD TO BE IT WAS VAIN ENOUGH FOR HIM ACCORDINGLY TO TRY TO IMPART A GLOSS TO HIS OWN COMPARATIVE BRUMMAGEM
2514-149482-0014 THE HUMILIATION OF THIS IMPOTENCE WAS PRECISELY WHAT AUNT MAUD SOUGHT TO MITIGATE FOR HIM BY KEEPING HIM DOWN AND AS HER EFFORT TO THAT END HAD DOUBTLESS NEVER YET BEEN SO VISIBLE HE HAD PROBABLY NEVER FELT SO DEFINITELY PLACED IN THE WORLD
2514-149482-0015 AS WHILE HE WAITED WITH HER FOR HER HALF DOZEN OTHER GUESTS SHE WELCOMED HIM GENIALLY BACK FROM THE STATES AS TO HIS VIEW OF WHICH HER FEW QUESTIONS THOUGH NOT COHERENT WERE COMPREHENSIVE
2514-149482-0016 AND HE HAD THE AMUSEMENT OF SEEING IN HER AS THROUGH A CLEAR GLASS THE OUTBREAK OF A PLAN AND THE SUDDEN CONSCIOUSNESS OF A CURIOSITY SHE BECAME AWARE OF AMERICA UNDER HIS EYES AS A POSSIBLE SCENE FOR SOCIAL OPERATIONS
2514-149482-0017 THE IDEA OF A VISIT TO THE WONDERFUL COUNTRY HAD CLEARLY BUT JUST OCCURRED TO HER YET SHE WAS TALKING OF IT AT THE END OF A MINUTE AS HER FAVOURITE DREAM HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN IT BUT HE PRETENDED TO THIS HELPED HER AS WELL AS ANYTHING ELSE
2514-149482-0018 TO TREAT HIM AS HARMLESS AND BLAMELESS SHE WAS SO ENGAGED WITH THE FURTHER AID OF A COMPLETE ABSENCE OF ALLUSIONS WHEN THE HIGHEST EFFECT WAS GIVEN HER METHOD BY THE BEAUTIFUL ENTRANCE OF KATE THE METHOD THEREFORE RECEIVED SUPPORT ALL ROUND
2514-149482-0019 FOR NO YOUNG MAN COULD HAVE BEEN LESS FORMIDABLE THAN THE PERSON TO THE RELIEF OF WHOSE SHYNESS HER NIECE OSTENSIBLY CAME THE OSTENSIBLE IN KATE STRUCK HIM ALTOGETHER ON THIS OCCASION AS PRODIGIOUS
2514-149482-0020 WHILE SCARCELY LESS PRODIGIOUS FOR THAT MATTER WAS HIS OWN READING ON THE SPOT OF THE RELATION BETWEEN HIS COMPANIONS A RELATION LIGHTED FOR HIM BY THE STRAIGHT LOOK NOT EXACTLY LOVING NOR LINGERING YET SEARCHING AND SOFT
2514-149482-0021 THAT ON THE PART OF THEIR HOSTESS THE GIRL HAD TO RECKON WITH AS SHE ADVANCED IT TOOK HER IN FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND IN DOING SO IT TOLD A STORY THAT MADE POOR DENSHER AGAIN THE LEAST BIT SICK IT MARKED SO SOMETHING WITH WHICH KATE HABITUALLY
2514-149482-0022 AND CONSUMMATELY RECKONED THAT WAS THE STORY THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS FOR HER BENEFICENT DRAGON UNDER ARMS LIVING UP EVERY HOUR BUT ESPECIALLY AT FESTAL HOURS TO THE VALUE MISSUS LOWDER HAD ATTACHED TO HER
2514-149482-0023 HIGH AND FIXED THIS ESTIMATE RULED ON EACH OCCASION AT LANCASTER GATE THE SOCIAL SCENE SO THAT HE NOW RECOGNISED IN IT SOMETHING LIKE THE ARTISTIC IDEA THE PLASTIC SUBSTANCE IMPOSED BY TRADITION BY GENIUS BY CRITICISM
2514-149482-0024 IN RESPECT TO A GIVEN CHARACTER ON A DISTINGUISHED ACTRESS AS SUCH A PERSON WAS TO DRESS THE PART TO WALK TO LOOK TO SPEAK IN EVERY WAY TO EXPRESS THE PART SO ALL THIS WAS WHAT KATE WAS TO DO FOR THE CHARACTER SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN
2514-149482-0025 THINGS ALL PERFECTLY PONDERABLE TO CRITICISM AND THE WAY FOR HER TO MEET CRITICISM WAS EVIDENTLY AT THE START TO BE SURE HER MAKE UP HAD HAD THE LAST TOUCH AND THAT SHE LOOKED AT LEAST NO WORSE THAN USUAL
2514-149482-0026 AUNT MAUD'S APPRECIATION OF THAT TO NIGHT WAS INDEED MANAGERIAL AND THE PERFORMER'S OWN CONTRIBUTION FAIRLY THAT OF THE FAULTLESS SOLDIER ON PARADE DENSHER SAW HIMSELF FOR THE MOMENT AS IN HIS PURCHASED STALL AT THE PLAY
2514-149482-0027 THE WATCHFUL MANAGER WAS IN THE DEPTHS OF A BOX AND THE POOR ACTRESS IN THE GLARE OF THE FOOTLIGHTS BUT SHE PASSED THE POOR PERFORMER HE COULD SEE HOW SHE ALWAYS PASSED HER WIG HER PAINT HER JEWELS EVERY MARK OF HER EXPRESSION IMPECCABLE
2514-149482-0028 AND HER ENTRANCE ACCORDINGLY GREETED WITH THE PROPER ROUND OF APPLAUSE SUCH IMPRESSIONS AS WE THUS NOTE FOR DENSHER COME AND GO IT MUST BE GRANTED IN VERY MUCH LESS TIME THAN NOTATION DEMANDS BUT WE MAY NONE THE LESS MAKE THE POINT THAT THERE WAS STILL FURTHER
2514-149482-0029 TIME AMONG THEM FOR HIM TO FEEL ALMOST TOO SCARED TO TAKE PART IN THE OVATION HE STRUCK HIMSELF AS HAVING LOST FOR THE MINUTE HIS PRESENCE OF MIND SO THAT IN ANY CASE HE ONLY STARED IN SILENCE AT THE OLDER WOMAN'S TECHNICAL CHALLENGE
2514-149482-0030 IT WAS AS IF THE DRAMA IT THUS CAME TO HIM FOR THE FACT OF A DRAMA THERE WAS NO BLINKING WAS BETWEEN THEM THEM QUITE PREPONDERANTLY WITH MERTON DENSHER RELEGATED TO MERE SPECTATORSHIP A PAYING PLACE IN FRONT AND ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE
2514-149482-0031 THIS WAS WHY HIS APPRECIATION HAD TURNED FOR THE INSTANT TO FEAR HAD JUST TURNED AS WE HAVE SAID TO SICKNESS
2514-149482-0032 THAT THE DISCIPLINED FACE DID OFFER HIM OVER THE FOOTLIGHTS AS HE BELIEVED THE SMALL GLEAM FINE FAINT BUT EXQUISITE OF A SPECIAL INTELLIGENCE SO MIGHT A PRACTISED PERFORMER EVEN WHEN RAKED BY DOUBLE BARRELLED GLASSES SEEM TO BE ALL IN HER PART
2514-149482-0033 AND YET CONVEY A SIGN TO THE PERSON IN THE HOUSE SHE LOVED BEST THE DRAMA AT ALL EVENTS AS DENSHER SAW IT MEANWHILE WENT ON AMPLIFIED SOON ENOUGH BY THE ADVENT OF TWO OTHER GUESTS STRAY GENTLEMEN BOTH STRAGGLERS IN THE ROUT OF THE SEASON
2514-149482-0034 WHO VISIBLY PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO KATE DURING THE NEXT MOMENTS AS SUBJECTS FOR A LIKE IMPERSONAL TREATMENT AND SHARERS IN A LIKE USUAL MERCY AT OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE SOCIAL COURSE THEY DISPLAYED IN RESPECT TO THE FIGURE
2514-149482-0035 THAT EACH IN HIS WAY MADE ONE THE EXPANSIVE THE OTHER THE CONTRACTILE EFFECT OF THE PERFECT WHITE WAISTCOAT A SCRATCH COMPANY OF TWO INNOCUOUS YOUTHS AND A PACIFIED VETERAN WAS THEREFORE WHAT NOW OFFERED ITSELF TO MISSUS STRINGHAM
2514-149482-0036 HER COMPANION AT THE LAST MOMENT HAD BEEN INDISPOSED POSITIVELY NOT WELL ENOUGH AND SO HAD PACKED HER OFF INSISTENTLY WITH EXCUSES WITH WILD REGRETS
2514-149482-0037 THIS CIRCUMSTANCE OF THEIR CHARMING FRIEND'S ILLNESS WAS THE FIRST THING KATE TOOK UP WITH DENSHER ON THEIR BEING ABLE AFTER DINNER
2514-149482-0038 NATURALLY AS SHE CALLED IT WHICH WASN'T WHAT HE DID TOGETHER BUT IT WAS ALREADY AS IF THE YOUNG MAN HAD BY AN ODD IMPRESSION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
2514-149482-0039 MISSUS LOWDER HAD MADE DEAR MILLY THE TOPIC AND IT PROVED ON THE SPOT A TOPIC AS FAMILIAR TO THE ENTHUSIASTIC YOUNGER AS TO THE SAGACIOUS OLDER MAN ANY KNOWLEDGE THEY MIGHT LACK MISSUS LOWDER'S NIECE WAS MOREOVER ALERT TO SUPPLY
2514-149482-0040 WHILE DENSHER HIMSELF WAS FREELY APPEALED TO AS THE MOST PRIVILEGED AFTER ALL OF THE GROUP WASN'T IT HE WHO HAD IN A MANNER INVENTED THE WONDERFUL CREATURE THROUGH HAVING SEEN HER FIRST CAUGHT HER IN HER NATIVE JUNGLE HADN'T HE MORE OR LESS PAVED THE WAY
2514-149482-0041 FOR HER BY HIS PROMPT RECOGNITION OF HER RARITY BY PRECEDING HER IN A FRIENDLY SPIRIT AS HE HAD THE EAR OF SOCIETY WITH A SHARP FLASHLIGHT OR TWO HE MET POOR DENSHER THESE ENQUIRIES AS HE COULD
2514-149482-0042 LISTENING WITH INTEREST YET WITH DISCOMFORT WINCING IN PARTICULAR DRY JOURNALIST AS HE WAS TO FIND IT SEEMINGLY SUPPOSED OF HIM THAT HE HAD PUT HIS PEN OH HIS PEN AT THE SERVICE OF PRIVATE DISTINCTION THE EAR OF SOCIETY
2514-149482-0043 THEY WERE TALKING OR ALMOST AS IF HE HAD PUBLICLY PARAGRAPHED A MODEST YOUNG LADY THEY DREAMT DREAMS IN TRUTH HE APPEARED TO PERCEIVE THAT FAIRLY WAKED HIM UP AND HE SETTLED HIMSELF IN HIS PLACE
2514-149482-0044 BOTH TO RESIST HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND TO CATCH THE FULL REVELATION HIS EMBARRASSMENT CAME NATURALLY FROM THE FACT THAT IF HE COULD CLAIM NO CREDIT FOR MISS THEALE'S SUCCESS SO NEITHER COULD HE GRACEFULLY INSIST ON HIS NOT HAVING BEEN CONCERNED WITH HER
2514-149482-0045 MISSUS LOWDER HAD WONDERS TO TELL OF IT THE TWO WEARERS OF THE WAISTCOAT EITHER WITH SINCERITY OR WITH HYPOCRISY PROFESSED IN THE MATTER AN EQUAL EXPERTNESS AND DENSHER AT LAST SEEMED TO KNOW HIMSELF IN PRESENCE OF A SOCIAL CASE
2514-149482-0046 IT WAS MISSUS STRINGHAM OBVIOUSLY WHOSE TESTIMONY WOULD HAVE BEEN MOST INVOKED HADN'T SHE BEEN AS HER FRIEND'S REPRESENTATIVE RATHER CONFINED TO THE FUNCTION OF INHALING THE INCENSE SO THAT KATE
2514-149482-0047 WHO TREATED HER BEAUTIFULLY SMILING AT HER CHEERING AND CONSOLING HER ACROSS THE TABLE APPEARED BENEVOLENTLY BOTH TO SPEAK AND TO INTERPRET FOR HER KATE SPOKE AS IF SHE WOULDN'T PERHAPS UNDERSTAND THEIR WAY OF APPRECIATING MILLY
2514-149482-0048 BUT WOULD LET THEM NONE THE LESS IN JUSTICE TO THEIR GOOD WILL EXPRESS IT IN THEIR COARSER FASHION DENSHER HIMSELF WASN'T UNCONSCIOUS IN RESPECT TO THIS OF A CERTAIN BROAD BROTHERHOOD WITH MISSUS STRINGHAM WONDERING INDEED WHILE HE FOLLOWED THE TALK HOW
2514-149482-0049 IT MIGHT MOVE AMERICAN NERVES HE HAD ONLY HEARD OF THEM BEFORE BUT IN HIS RECENT TOUR HE HAD CAUGHT THEM IN THE REMARKABLE FACT AND THERE WAS NOW A MOMENT OR TWO WHEN IT CAME TO HIM THAT HE HAD PERHAPS AND NOT IN THE WAY OF AN ESCAPE
2514-149482-0050 TAKEN A LESSON FROM THEM THEY QUIVERED CLEARLY THEY HUMMED AND DRUMMED THEY LEAPED AND BOUNDED IN MISSUS STRINGHAM'S TYPICAL ORGANISM THIS LADY STRIKING HIM AS BEFORE ALL THINGS EXCITED AS IN THE NATIVE PHRASE KEYED UP
2514-149482-0051 TO A PERCEPTION OF MORE ELEMENTS IN THE OCCASION THAN HE WAS HIMSELF ABLE TO COUNT SHE WAS ACCESSIBLE TO SIDES OF IT HE IMAGINED THAT WERE AS YET OBSCURE TO HIM FOR THOUGH SHE UNMISTAKEABLY REJOICED AND SOARED
2514-149482-0052 HER LITTLE DRY NEW ENGLAND BRIGHTNESS HE HAD SAMPLED ALL THE SHADES OF THE AMERICAN COMPLEXITY IF COMPLEXITY IT WERE HAD ITS ACTUAL REASONS FOR FINDING RELIEF MOST IN SILENCE
2514-149482-0053 SO THAT BEFORE THE SUBJECT WAS CHANGED HE PERCEIVED WITH SURPRISE AT THE OTHERS THAT THEY HAD GIVEN HER ENOUGH OF IT
2514-149482-0054 HAD REALLY NOT MADE IN HER OWN COUNTRY THE MARK SHE HAD CHALKED SO LARGE IN LONDON
2514-149482-0055 WHILE HE SCARCE KNEW IF HE WERE THE MORE IMPRESSED WITH HER LAUNCHING IT UNDER MISSUS STRINGHAM'S NOSE OR WITH HER HOPE THAT HE WOULD ALLOW TO LONDON THE HONOUR OF DISCOVERY THE LESS EXPANSIVE OF THE WHITE WAISTCOATS PROPOUNDED THE THEORY THAT THEY SAW IN LONDON
2514-149482-0056 FOR ALL THAT WAS SAID MUCH FURTHER THAN IN THE STATES IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME HE URGED THAT THEY HAD TAUGHT THE AMERICANS TO APPRECIATE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT WAS FUNNY SOME NATIVE PRODUCT
2514-149482-0057 BUT IT MIGHT VERY WELL BE THAT NEW YORK IN HAVING HER TO SHOW HADN'T BEEN AWARE OF ITS LUCK THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE NOTHING OVER THERE AND YET WERE AWFULLY TAKEN UP IN ENGLAND JUST AS TO MAKE THE BALANCE RIGHT THANK GOODNESS
2514-149482-0058 THEY SOMETIMES SENT OUT BEAUTIES AND CELEBRITIES WHO LEFT THE BRITON COLD THE BRITON'S TEMPERATURE IN TRUTH WASN'T TO BE CALCULATED A FORMULATION OF THE MATTER THAT WAS NOT REACHED
2514-149482-0059 SHE ANNOUNCED THAT IF THE POINT OF VIEW FOR A PROPER ADMIRATION OF HER YOUNG FRIEND HAD SEEMED TO FAIL A LITTLE IN NEW YORK THERE WAS NO MANNER OF DOUBT OF HER HAVING CARRIED BOSTON BY STORM
2514-149482-0060 IT POINTED THE MORAL THAT BOSTON FOR THE FINER TASTE LEFT NEW YORK NOWHERE AND THE GOOD LADY AS THE EXPONENT OF THIS DOCTRINE WHICH SHE SET FORTH AT A CERTAIN LENGTH MADE OBVIOUSLY TO DENSHER'S MIND HER NEAREST APPROACH TO SUPPLYING
2514-149482-0061 THE WEIRDNESS IN WHICH MILLY'S ABSENCE HAD LEFT THEM DEFICIENT SHE MADE IT INDEED EFFECTIVE FOR HIM BY SUDDENLY ADDRESSING HIM YOU KNOW NOTHING SIR BUT NOT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY FRIEND
2514-149482-0062 HE HADN'T PRETENDED HE DID BUT THERE WAS A PURITY OF REPROACH IN MISSUS STRINGHAM'S FACE AND TONE A PURITY CHARGED APPARENTLY WITH SOLEMN MEANINGS SO THAT FOR A LITTLE SMALL AS HAD BEEN HIS CLAIM HE COULDN'T BUT FEEL THAT SHE EXAGGERATED
2514-149482-0063 BUT WHILE DOING SO HE DEFENDED HIMSELF I CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW ENORMOUSLY MUCH BEYOND HER HAVING BEEN MOST KIND TO ME IN NEW YORK AS A POOR BEWILDERED AND NEWLY LANDED ALIEN
2514-149482-0064 AND MY HAVING TREMENDOUSLY APPRECIATED IT TO WHICH HE ADDED HE SCARCE KNEW WHY WHAT HAD AN IMMEDIATE SUCCESS REMEMBER MISSUS STRINGHAM THAT YOU WEREN'T THEN PRESENT AH THERE YOU ARE SAID KATE WITH MUCH GAY EXPRESSION
2514-149482-0065 THOUGH WHAT IT EXPRESSED HE FAILED AT THE TIME TO MAKE OUT YOU WEREN'T PRESENT THEN DEAREST MISSUS LOWDER RICHLY CONCURRED YOU DON'T KNOW SHE CONTINUED WITH MELLOW GAIETY HOW FAR THINGS MAY HAVE GONE
2514-149482-0066 IT MADE THE LITTLE WOMAN HE COULD SEE REALLY LOSE HER HEAD SHE HAD MORE THINGS IN THAT HEAD THAN ANY OF THEM IN ANY OTHER UNLESS PERHAPS IT WERE KATE WHOM HE FELT AS INDIRECTLY WATCHING HIM DURING THIS FOOLISH PASSAGE
2514-149482-0067 AND BECAUSE OF THE FOOLISHNESS NOT TO MEET HER EYES HE MET MISSUS STRINGHAM'S WHICH AFFECTED HIM WITH HER HE COULD ON OCCASION CLEAR IT UP A SENSE PRODUCED BY THE MUTE COMMUNION BETWEEN THEM AND
2514-149482-0068 REALLY THE BEGINNING AS THE EVENT WAS TO SHOW OF SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY IT WAS EVEN ALREADY A LITTLE THE EFFECT OF THIS COMMUNION THAT MISSUS STRINGHAM PERCEPTIBLY FALTERED IN HER RETORT TO MISSUS LOWDER'S JOKE
2514-149482-0069 OH IT'S PRECISELY MY POINT THAT MISTER DENSHER CAN'T HAVE HAD VAST OPPORTUNITIES AND THEN SHE SMILED AT HIM I WASN'T AWAY YOU KNOW LONG IT MADE EVERYTHING IN THE ODDEST WAY IN THE WORLD IMMEDIATELY RIGHT FOR HIM
2514-149482-0070 AND I WASN'T THERE LONG EITHER HE POSITIVELY SAW WITH IT THAT NOTHING FOR HIM SO FAR AS SHE WAS CONCERNED WOULD AGAIN BE WRONG SHE'S BEAUTIFUL BUT I DON'T SAY SHE'S EASY TO KNOW
2514-149482-0071 AS IF NOW TO KEEP WELL WITH HIM HE ASKED NOTHING BETTER SHE WAS OFF WITH YOU TO THESE PARTS BEFORE I KNEW IT I MYSELF WAS OFF TOO AWAY OFF TO WONDERFUL PARTS WHERE I HAD ENDLESSLY MORE TO SEE
2514-149482-0072 BUT YOU DIDN'T FORGET HER AUNT MAUD INTERPOSED WITH ALMOST MENACING ARCHNESS
2514-149482-0073 SHE'LL THANK YOU FOR THAT SIR SAID MISSUS STRINGHAM WITH A FLUSHED FIRMNESS YET DOESN'T SILENCE IN SUCH A CASE AUNT MAUD BLANDLY ENQUIRED VERY OFTEN QUITE PROVE THE DEPTH OF THE IMPRESSION
2514-149482-0074 HE WOULD HAVE BEEN AMUSED HADN'T HE BEEN SLIGHTLY DISPLEASED AT ALL THEY SEEMED DESIROUS TO FASTEN ON HIM WELL THE IMPRESSION WAS AS DEEP AS YOU LIKE BUT I REALLY WANT MISS THEALE TO KNOW HE PURSUED FOR MISSUS STRINGHAM THAT I DON'T FIGURE BY ANY CONSENT OF MY OWN
2514-149482-0075 KATE CAME TO HIS ASSISTANCE IF ASSISTANCE IT WAS BEFORE THEIR FRIEND HAD HAD TIME TO MEET THIS CHARGE YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT HER NOT BEING EASY TO KNOW ONE SEES HER WITH INTENSITY SEES HER MORE THAN ONE SEES ALMOST ANY ONE BUT THEN ONE DISCOVERS
2514-149482-0076 THAT THAT ISN'T KNOWING HER AND THAT ONE MAY KNOW BETTER A PERSON WHOM ONE DOESN'T SEE AS I SAY HALF SO MUCH THE DISCRIMINATION WAS INTERESTING BUT IT BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THE FACT OF HER SUCCESS AND IT WAS AT THAT COMPARATIVELY GROSS CIRCUMSTANCE
2514-149482-0077 NOW SO FULLY PLACED BEFORE THEM THAT MILLY'S ANXIOUS COMPANION SAT AND LOOKED LOOKED VERY MUCH AS SOME SPECTATOR IN AN OLD TIME CIRCUS MIGHT HAVE WATCHED THE ODDITY OF A CHRISTIAN MAIDEN IN THE ARENA MILDLY CARESSINGLY MARTYRED
2514-149482-0078 IT WAS THE NOSING AND FUMBLING NOT OF LIONS AND TIGERS BUT OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS LET LOOSE AS FOR THE JOKE EVEN THE JOKE MADE MISSUS STRINGHAM UNEASY AND HER MUTE COMMUNION WITH DENSHER TO WHICH WE HAVE ALLUDED
2514-149482-0079 HE WONDERED AFTERWARDS IF KATE HAD MADE THIS OUT THOUGH IT WAS NOT INDEED TILL MUCH LATER ON THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THOUGHT DIVIDING THE THINGS SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF FROM THE THINGS SHE MUST HAVE MISSED
2514-149482-0080 IF SHE ACTUALLY MISSED AT ANY RATE MISSUS STRINGHAM'S DISCOMFORT THAT BUT SHOWED HOW HER OWN IDEA HELD HER HER OWN IDEA WAS BY INSISTING ON THE FACT OF THE GIRL'S PROMINENCE AS A FEATURE OF THE SEASON'S END
2514-149482-0081 TO KEEP DENSHER IN RELATION FOR THE REST OF THEM BOTH TO PRESENT AND TO PAST IT'S EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THAT MAKES YOU NATURALLY A LITTLE SHY ABOUT HER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE BUT WE DO WE'VE SEEN IT AND FOLLOWED IT
2514-149482-0082 WE'VE A LITTLE BEEN OF IT THE GREAT THING FOR HIM AT THIS AS KATE GAVE IT WAS IN FACT QUITE IRRESISTIBLY THAT THE CASE WAS A REAL ONE THE KIND OF THING THAT WHEN ONE'S PATIENCE WAS SHORTER THAN ONE'S CURIOSITY
2514-149482-0083 ONE HAD VAGUELY TAKEN FOR POSSIBLE IN LONDON BUT IN WHICH ONE HAD NEVER BEEN EVEN TO THIS SMALL EXTENT CONCERNED THE LITTLE AMERICAN'S SUDDEN SOCIAL ADVENTURE HER HAPPY AND NO DOUBT HARMLESS FLOURISH
2514-149482-0084 HAD PROBABLY BEEN FAVOURED BY SEVERAL ACCIDENTS BUT IT HAD BEEN FAVOURED ABOVE ALL BY THE SIMPLE SPRING BOARD OF THE SCENE BY ONE OF THOSE COMMON CAPRICES OF THE NUMBERLESS FOOLISH FLOCK GREGARIOUS MOVEMENTS AS INSCRUTABLE
2514-149482-0085 AS OCEAN CURRENTS THE HUDDLED HERD HAD DRIFTED TO HER BLINDLY IT MIGHT AS BLINDLY HAVE DRIFTED AWAY
2514-149482-0086 BUT THE GREAT REASON WAS PROBABLY THE ABSENCE AT THE MOMENT OF A LARGER LION THE BIGGER BEAST WOULD COME AND THE SMALLER WOULD THEN INCONTINENTLY VANISH IT WAS AT ALL EVENTS CHARACTERISTIC
2514-149482-0087 AND WHAT WAS OF THE ESSENCE OF IT WAS GRIST TO HIS SCRIBBLING MILL MATTER FOR HIS JOURNALISING HAND THAT HAND ALREADY IN INTENTION PLAYED OVER IT THE MOTIVE AS A SIGN OF THE SEASON A FEATURE OF THE TIME OF THE PURELY EXPEDITIOUS
2514-149482-0088 AND ROUGH AND TUMBLE NATURE OF THE SOCIAL BOOM THE BOOM AS IN ITSELF REQUIRED THAT WOULD BE THE NOTE THE SUBJECT OF THE PROCESS A COMPARATIVELY MINOR QUESTION ANYTHING WAS BOOMABLE ENOUGH WHEN NOTHING ELSE WAS MORE SO
2514-149482-0089 THE AUTHOR OF THE ROTTEN BOOK THE BEAUTY WHO WAS NO BEAUTY THE HEIRESS WHO WAS ONLY THAT THE STRANGER WHO WAS FOR THE MOST PART SAVED FROM BEING INCONVENIENTLY STRANGE BUT BY BEING INCONVENIENTLY FAMILIAR
2514-149482-0090 THE CREATURE IN FINE AS TO WHOM SPANGLES OR SPOTS OF ANY SUFFICIENTLY MARKED AND EXHIBITED SORT COULD BE LOUDLY ENOUGH PREDICATED
2514-149482-0091 AND THE TONE OF SOCIETY WENT SO FAR AS TO MAKE HIM TAKE UP AGAIN HIS SENSE OF INDEPENDENCE HE HAD SUPPOSED HIMSELF CIVILISED BUT IF THIS WAS CIVILISATION ONE COULD SMOKE ONE'S PIPE OUTSIDE WHEN TWADDLE WAS WITHIN
2514-149482-0092 HE HAD RATHER AVOIDED AS WE HAVE REMARKED KATE'S EYES BUT THERE CAME A MOMENT WHEN HE WOULD FAIRLY HAVE LIKED TO PUT IT ACROSS THE TABLE TO HER I SAY LIGHT OF MY LIFE IS THIS THE GREAT WORLD
2514-149482-0093 THERE CAME ANOTHER IT MUST BE ADDED AND DOUBTLESS AS A RESULT OF SOMETHING THAT OVER THE CLOTH DID HANG BETWEEN THEM WHEN SHE STRUCK HIM AS HAVING QUITE ANSWERED DEAR NO FOR WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME
2514-149482-0094 NOT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT ONLY A POOR SILLY THOUGH QUITE HARMLESS IMITATION WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE PASSED FOR SAYING HOWEVER WAS PRACTICALLY MERGED IN WHAT SHE DID SAY FOR SHE CAME OVERTLY TO HIS AID VERY MUCH AS IF GUESSING SOME OF HIS THOUGHTS
2514-149482-0095 SHE ENUNCIATED TO RELIEVE HIS BEWILDERMENT THE OBVIOUS TRUTH THAT YOU COULDN'T LEAVE LONDON FOR THREE MONTHS AT THAT TIME OF THE YEAR AND COME BACK TO FIND YOUR FRIENDS JUST WHERE THEY WERE AS THEY HAD OF COURSE BEEN JIGGING AWAY
2514-149482-0096 THEY MIGHT WELL BE SO RED IN THE FACE THAT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THEM SHE RECONCILED IN FINE HIS DISCLAIMER ABOUT MILLY WITH THAT HONOUR OF HAVING DISCOVERED HER WHICH IT WAS VAIN FOR HIM MODESTLY TO SHIRK HE HAD UNEARTHED HER
2514-149482-0097 BUT IT WAS THEY ALL OF THEM TOGETHER WHO HAD DEVELOPED HER SHE WAS ALWAYS A CHARMER ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER SEEN BUT SHE WASN'T THE PERSON HE HAD BACKED
2514-149482-0098 DENSHER WAS TO FEEL SURE AFTERWARDS THAT KATE HAD HAD IN THESE PLEASANTRIES NO CONSCIOUS ABOVE ALL NO INSOLENT PURPOSE OF MAKING LIGHT OF POOR SUSAN SHEPHERD'S PROPERTY IN THEIR YOUNG FRIEND WHICH PROPERTY BY SUCH REMARKS
2514-149482-0099 WAS VERY MUCH PUSHED TO THE WALL BUT HE WAS ALSO TO KNOW THAT MISSUS STRINGHAM HAD SECRETLY RESENTED THEM MISSUS STRINGHAM HOLDING THE OPINION OF WHICH HE WAS ULTIMATELY TO HAVE A GLIMPSE THAT ALL THE KATE CROYS IN CHRISTENDOM WERE BUT DUST FOR THE FEET OF HER MILLY
2514-149482-0100 THAT IT WAS TRUE WOULD BE WHAT SHE MUST REVEAL ONLY WHEN DRIVEN TO HER LAST ENTRENCHMENTS AND WELL CORNERED IN HER PASSION THE RARE PASSION OF FRIENDSHIP THE SOLE PASSION OF HER LITTLE LIFE SAVE THE ONE OTHER MORE IMPERTURBABLY CEREBRAL
2514-149482-0101 SHE SLIPPED IN THE OBSERVATION THAT HER MILLY WAS INCAPABLE OF CHANGE WAS JUST EXACTLY ON THE CONTRARY
2514-149482-0102 SHE WAS PERFECTLY KIND TO SUSIE IT WAS AS IF SHE POSITIVELY KNEW HER AS HANDICAPPED FOR ANY DISAGREEMENT BY FEELING THAT SHE KATE HAD TYPE AND BY BEING COMMITTED TO ADMIRATION OF TYPE
2514-149482-0103 KATE HAD OCCASION SUBSEQUENTLY SHE FOUND IT SOMEHOW TO MENTION TO OUR YOUNG MAN MILLY'S HAVING SPOKEN TO HER OF THIS VIEW ON THE GOOD LADY'S PART SHE WOULD LIKE MILLY HAD HAD IT FROM HER TO PUT KATE CROY IN A BOOK AND SEE WHAT SHE COULD SO DO WITH HER
2514-149482-0104 CHOP ME UP FINE OR SERVE ME WHOLE IT WAS A WAY OF BEING GOT AT THAT KATE PROFESSED SHE DREADED IT WOULD BE MISSUS STRINGHAM'S HOWEVER SHE UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE MISSUS STRINGHAM ODDLY FELT
2514-149482-0105 THAT WITH SUCH STUFF AS THE STRANGE ENGLISH GIRL WAS MADE OF STUFF THAT IN SPITE OF MAUD MANNINGHAM WHO WAS FULL OF SENTIMENT SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN THERE WAS NONE OTHER TO BE EMPLOYED THESE THINGS WERE OF LATER EVIDENCE
2514-149482-0106 YET DENSHER MIGHT EVEN THEN HAVE FELT THEM IN THE AIR THEY WERE PRACTICALLY IN IT ALREADY WHEN KATE WAIVING THE QUESTION OF HER FRIEND'S CHEMICAL CHANGE WOUND UP WITH THE COMPARATIVELY UNOBJECTIONABLE PROPOSITION THAT HE MUST NOW HAVING MISSED SO MUCH
2514-149482-0107 TAKE THEM ALL UP ON TRUST FURTHER ON HE MET IT PEACEFULLY A LITTLE PERHAPS AS AN EXAMPLE TO MISSUS STRINGHAM OH AS FAR ON AS YOU LIKE THIS EVEN HAD ITS EFFECT MISSUS STRINGHAM APPROPRIATED AS MUCH OF IT AS MIGHT BE MEANT FOR HERSELF
2518-154825-0000 HOW FEARFUL AND DIZZY TIS TO CAST ONE'S EYES SO LOW I'LL LOOK NO MORE
2518-154825-0001 SHAKESPEARE THE WHILE CHALK WAS A BULWARK BETWEEN US AND THE FOE AND THOUGH ONE OR TWO OF THEM LOOSED OFF THEIR MATCHLOCKS TRYING TO GET AT US SIDEWAYS THEY COULD NOT EVEN SEE THEIR QUARRY
2518-154825-0002 AND TWAS ONLY SHOOTING AT A VENTURE WE WERE SAFE BUT FOR HOW SHORT A TIME SAFE JUST FOR SO LONG AS IT SHOULD PLEASE THE SOLDIERS NOT TO COME DOWN TO TAKE US
2518-154825-0003 SAFE WITH A DISCHARGED PISTOL IN OUR GRASP AND A SHOT MAN LYING AT OUR FEET ELZEVIR WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK CAN YOU STAND JOHN IS THE BONE BROKEN
2518-154825-0004 I CANNOT STAND I SAID THERE IS SOMETHING GONE IN MY LEG AND I FEEL BLOOD RUNNING DOWN INTO MY BOOT HE KNELT AND ROLLED DOWN THE LEG OF MY STOCKING BUT THOUGH HE ONLY MOVED MY FOOT
2518-154825-0005 EVER SO LITTLE IT CAUSED ME SHARP PAIN FOR FEELING WAS COMING BACK AFTER THE FIRST NUMBNESS OF THE SHOT THEY HAVE BROKE THE LEG THOUGH IT BLEEDS LITTLE ELZEVIR SAID WE HAVE NO TIME TO SPLICE IT HERE
2518-154825-0006 BUT I WILL PUT A KERCHIEF ROUND AND WHILE I WRAP IT LISTEN TO HOW WE LIE AND THEN CHOOSE WHAT WE SHALL DO I NODDED BITING MY LIPS HARD TO CONCEAL THE PAIN HE GAVE ME AND HE WENT ON
2518-154825-0007 WE HAVE A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE THE POSSE CAN GET DOWN TO US BUT COME THEY WILL AND THOU CANST JUDGE WHAT CHANCE WE HAVE TO SAVE LIBERTY
2518-154825-0008 AND HE JERKED HIS THUMB AT MASKEW
2518-154825-0009 AND THEREFORE DO NOT BLAME THEE IF THOU DIDST MAKE ME WASTE A CHARGE IN AIR SO ONE THING WE CAN DO IS TO WAIT HERE UNTIL THEY COME AND I CAN ACCOUNT FOR A FEW OF THEM BEFORE THEY SHOOT ME DOWN BUT THOU CANST NOT FIGHT WITH A BROKEN LEG
2518-154825-0010 AND THEY WILL TAKE THEE ALIVE AND THEN THERE IS A DANCE ON AIR AT DORCHESTER JAIL I FELT SICK WITH PAIN AND BITTERLY CAST DOWN TO THINK THAT I WAS LIKE TO COME SO SOON TO SUCH A VILE END
2518-154825-0011 SO ONLY GAVE A SIGH WISHING HEARTILY THAT MASKEW WERE NOT DEAD AND THAT MY LEG WERE NOT BROKE BUT THAT I WAS BACK AGAIN AT THE WHY NOT OR EVEN HEARING ONE OF DOCTOR SHERLOCK'S SERMONS IN MY AUNT'S PARLOUR
2518-154825-0012 THERE IS YET ANOTHER WAY THAT WE MAY TRY AND IF THOU HADST BUT TWO WHOLE LEGS I WOULD HAVE TRIED IT BUT NOW TIS LITTLE SHORT OF MADNESS AND YET IF THOU FEAR'ST NOT I WILL STILL TRY IT
2518-154825-0013 JUST AT THE END OF THIS FLAT LEDGE FARTHEST FROM WHERE THE BRIDLE PATH LEADS DOWN BUT NOT A HUNDRED YARDS FROM WHERE WE STAND THERE IS A SHEEP TRACK LEADING UP THE CLIFF IT STARTS
2518-154825-0014 WHERE THE UNDER CLIFF DIES BACK AGAIN INTO THE CHALK FACE AND CLIMBS BY SLANTS AND ELBOW TURNS UP TO THE TOP THE SHEPHERDS CALL IT THE ZIGZAG AND EVEN SHEEP LOSE THEIR FOOTING ON IT AND OF MEN
2518-154825-0015 I NEVER HEARD BUT ONE HAD CLIMBED IT AND THAT WAS LANDER JORDAN WHEN THE EXCISE WAS ON HIS HEELS HALF A CENTURY BACK BUT HE THAT TRIES IT STAKES ALL ON HEAD AND FOOT AND A WOUNDED BIRD LIKE THEE MAY NOT DARE THAT FLIGHT
2518-154825-0016 YET IF THOU ART CONTENT TO HANG THY LIFE UPON A HAIR I WILL CARRY THEE SOME WAY AND WHERE THERE IS NO ROOM TO CARRY
2518-154825-0017 IT WAS A DESPERATE CHANCE ENOUGH BUT CAME AS WELCOME AS A PATCH OF BLUE THROUGH LOWERING SKIES YES I SAID DEAR MASTER ELZEVIR LET US GET TO IT QUICKLY AND IF WE FALL
2518-154825-0018 TIS BETTER FAR TO DIE UPON THE ROCKS BELOW THAN TO WAIT HERE FOR THEM TO HALE US OFF TO JAIL AND WITH THAT I TRIED TO STAND THINKING I MIGHT GO DOT AND CARRY EVEN WITH A BROKEN LEG
2518-154825-0019 AND A THREAD OF BLOOD THAT WELLED UP FROM IT AND TRICKLED OFF ON TO THE SWARD IT WAS A SIGHT TO STAGGER ANY MAN AND WOULD HAVE MADE ME SWOON PERHAPS BUT THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR WE WERE AT THE END OF THE UNDER CLIFF
2518-154825-0020 AND TWAS A TASK THAT MIGHT COW THE BRAVEST AND WHEN I LOOKED UPON THE ZIGZAG IT SEEMED BETTER TO STAY WHERE WE WERE AND FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE POSSE THAN SET FOOT ON THAT AWFUL WAY AND FALL UPON THE ROCKS BELOW
2518-154825-0021 FOR THE ZIGZAG STARTED OFF AS A FAIR ENOUGH CHALK PATH BUT IN A FEW PACES NARROWED DOWN TILL IT WAS BUT A WHITER THREAD AGAINST THE GREY WHITE CLIFF FACE
2518-154825-0022 FAUGH SAID ELZEVIR TIS A POOR BEAST HAS LOST HIS FOOTHOLD IT WAS AN ILL OMEN ENOUGH AND I SAID AS MUCH BESEECHING HIM TO MAKE HIS OWN WAY UP THE ZIGZAG
2518-154825-0023 AND LEAVE ME WHERE I WAS FOR THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE MERCY ON A BOY TUSH HE CRIED IT IS THY HEART THAT FAILS THEE AND TIS TOO LATE NOW TO CHANGE COUNSEL
2518-154825-0024 WE HAVE FIFTEEN MINUTES YET TO WIN OR LOSE WITH AND IF WE GAIN THE CLIFF TOP IN THAT TIME WE SHALL HAVE AN HOUR'S START OR MORE FOR THEY WILL TAKE ALL THAT TO SEARCH THE UNDER CLIFF AND MASKEW TOO
2518-154825-0025 WILL KEEP THEM IN CHECK A LITTLE WHILE THEY TRY TO BRING THE LIFE BACK TO SO GOOD A MAN BUT IF WE FALL WHY WE SHALL FALL TOGETHER AND OUTWIT THEIR CUNNING
2518-154825-0026 SO SHUT THY EYES AND KEEP THEM TIGHT UNTIL I BID THEE OPEN THEM WITH THAT HE CAUGHT ME UP AGAIN AND I SHUT MY EYES FIRM REBUKING MYSELF FOR MY FAINT HEARTEDNESS AND NOT TELLING HIM HOW MUCH MY FOOT HURT ME
2518-154825-0027 IN A MINUTE I KNEW FROM ELZEVIR'S STEPS THAT HE HAD LEFT THE TURF AND WAS UPON THE CHALK NOW I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE HALF A DOZEN MEN BESIDE IN ENGLAND WHO WOULD HAVE VENTURED UP THAT PATH EVEN FREE AND UNTRAMMELLED
2518-154825-0028 AND NOT A MAN IN ALL THE WORLD TO DO IT WITH A FULL GROWN LAD IN HIS ARMS YET ELZEVIR MADE NO BONES OF IT NOR SPOKE A SINGLE WORD ONLY HE WENT VERY SLOW AND I FELT HIM SCUFFLE WITH HIS FOOT
2518-154825-0029 THUS HE WENT ON FOR A TIME THAT SEEMED WITHOUT END AND YET WAS REALLY BUT A MINUTE OR TWO AND BY DEGREES I FELT THE WIND THAT WE COULD SCARCE PERCEIVE AT ALL ON THE UNDER CLIFF BLOW FRESHER AND COLD ON THE CLIFF SIDE
2518-154825-0030 AND THEN THE PATH GREW STEEPER AND STEEPER AND ELZEVIR WENT SLOWER AND SLOWER TILL AT LAST HE SPOKE JOHN I AM GOING TO STOP
2518-154825-0031 BUT OPEN NOT THY EYES TILL I HAVE SET THEE DOWN AND BID THEE I DID AS BIDDEN AND HE LOWERED ME GENTLY SETTING ME ON ALL FOURS UPON THE PATH AND SPEAKING AGAIN
2518-154825-0032 THE PATH IS TOO NARROW HERE FOR ME TO CARRY THEE AND THOU MUST CREEP ROUND THIS CORNER ON THY HANDS AND KNEES BUT HAVE A CARE TO KEEP THY OUTER HAND NEAR TO THE INNER AND THE BALANCE OF THY BODY TO THE CLIFF
2518-154825-0033 FOR THERE IS NO ROOM TO DANCE HORNPIPES HERE AND HOLD THY EYES FIXED ON THE CHALK WALL LOOKING NEITHER DOWN NOR SEAWARD TWAS WELL HE TOLD ME WHAT TO DO AND WELL I DID IT
2518-154825-0034 BUT SPENT MUCH TIME THAT WAS SO PRECIOUS IN TRAVELLING THOSE TEN YARDS TO TAKE ME ROUND THE FIRST ELBOW OF THE PATH FOR MY FOOT WAS HEAVY AND GAVE ME FIERCE PAIN TO DRAG THOUGH I TRIED TO MASK IT FROM ELZEVIR AND HE
2518-154825-0035 FORGETTING WHAT I SUFFERED CRIED OUT QUICKEN THY PACE LAD IF THOU CANST THE TIME IS SHORT NOW SO FRAIL IS MAN'S TEMPER THAT THOUGH HE WAS DOING MORE THAN ANY EVER DID TO SAVE ANOTHER'S LIFE AND WAS ALL I HAD TO TRUST TO IN THE WORLD YET
2518-154825-0036 BUT HERE WAS ANOTHER DIFFICULTY FOR THE PATH WAS STILL SO NARROW AND THE CLIFF WALL SO CLOSE THAT HE COULD NOT TAKE ME UP IN HIS ARMS SO I LAY FLAT ON MY FACE AND HE STEPPED OVER ME SETTING HIS FOOT BETWEEN MY SHOULDERS TO DO IT
2518-154825-0037 AND THEN WHILE HE KNELT DOWN UPON THE PATH
2518-154825-0038 PUTTING MY ARMS ROUND HIS NECK AND SO HE BORE ME PICKABACK I SHUT MY EYES FIRM AGAIN AND THUS WE MOVED ALONG ANOTHER SPELL MOUNTING STILL AND FEELING THE WIND STILL FRESHENING
2518-154825-0039 BOTH WERE ON ALL FOURS NOW ELZEVIR FIRST AND I FOLLOWING BUT AS I CREPT ALONG I RELAXED CARE FOR A MOMENT AND MY EYES WANDERED FROM THE CLIFF SIDE AND LOOKED DOWN AND FAR BELOW
2518-154825-0040 I SAW THE BLUE SEA TWINKLING LIKE A DAZZLING MIRROR AND THE GULLS WHEELING ABOUT THE SHEER CHALK WALL AND THEN I THOUGHT OF THAT BLOATED CARCASS OF A SHEEP THAT HAD FALLEN FROM THIS VERY SPOT PERHAPS AND IN AN INSTANT
2518-154825-0041 FELT A SICKENING QUALM AND SWIMMING OF THE BRAIN AND KNEW THAT I WAS GIDDY AND MUST FALL THEN I CALLED OUT TO ELZEVIR AND HE GUESSING WHAT HAD COME OVER ME CRIES TO TURN UPON MY SIDE AND PRESS MY BELLY TO THE CLIFF
2518-154825-0042 AND HOW HE DID IT IN SUCH A NARROW STRAIT I KNOW NOT BUT HE TURNED ROUND AND LYING DOWN HIMSELF THRUST HIS HAND FIRMLY IN MY BACK PRESSING ME CLOSER TO THE CLIFF YET IT WAS NONE TOO SOON FOR IF HE HAD NOT HELD ME TIGHT
2518-154825-0043 I SHOULD HAVE FLUNG MYSELF DOWN IN SHEER DESPAIR TO GET QUIT OF THAT DREADFUL SICKNESS KEEP THINE EYES SHUT JOHN HE SAID AND COUNT UP NUMBERS LOUD TO ME THAT I MAY KNOW THOU ART NOT TURNING FAINT
2518-154825-0044 SO I GAVE OUT ONE TWO THREE AND WHILE I WENT ON COUNTING HEARD HIM REPEATING TO HIMSELF THOUGH HIS WORDS SEEMED THIN AND FAR OFF WE MUST HAVE TAKEN TEN MINUTES TO GET HERE
2518-154825-0045 AND IN FIVE MORE THEY WILL BE ON THE UNDER CLIFF AND IF WE EVER REACH THE TOP WHO KNOWS BUT THEY HAVE LEFT A GUARD NO NO THEY WILL NOT LEAVE A GUARD FOR NOT A MAN KNOWS OF THE ZIGZAG AND IF THEY KNEW
2518-154825-0046 LIKE SITTING GUILLEMOTS AGAINST THE CLIFF FACE SO HE TALKED TO HIMSELF AND ALL THE WHILE I WOULD HAVE GIVEN A WORLD TO PLUCK UP HEART AND CREEP ON FARTHER YET COULD NOT FOR THE DEADLY SWEATING FEAR THAT HAD HOLD OF ME
2518-154825-0047 THUS I LAY WITH MY FACE TO THE CLIFF AND ELZEVIR PUSHING FIRMLY IN MY BACK AND THE THING THAT FRIGHTENED ME MOST WAS THAT THERE WAS NOTHING AT ALL FOR THE HAND TO TAKE HOLD OF FOR HAD THERE BEEN A PIECE OF STRING OR EVEN A THREAD OF COTTON
2518-154825-0048 I THINK I COULD HAVE DONE IT BUT THERE WAS ONLY THE CLIFF WALL SHEER AND WHITE AGAINST THAT NARROWEST WAY WITH NEVER CRANNY TO PUT A FINGER INTO THE WIND WAS BLOWING IN FRESH PUFFS AND THOUGH I DID NOT OPEN MY EYES
2518-154825-0049 I KNEW THAT IT WAS MOVING THE LITTLE TUFTS OF BENT GRASS AND THE CHIDING CRIES OF THE GULLS SEEMED TO INVITE ME TO BE DONE WITH FEAR AND PAIN AND BROKEN LEG AND FLING MYSELF OFF ON TO THE ROCKS BELOW THEN ELZEVIR SPOKE JOHN HE SAID
2518-154825-0050 THERE IS NO TIME TO PLAY THE WOMAN ANOTHER MINUTE OF THIS AND WE ARE LOST PLUCK UP THY COURAGE KEEP THY EYES TO THE CLIFF AND FORWARD YET I COULD NOT BUT ANSWERED I CANNOT I CANNOT
2518-154825-0051 MOVE THOU MUST AND TIS BETTER TO RISK FALLING NOW THAN FALL FOR CERTAIN WITH ANOTHER BULLET IN THEE LATER ON AND WITH THAT HE SHIFTED HIS HAND FROM MY BACK AND FIXED IT IN MY COAT COLLAR MOVING BACKWARDS HIMSELF AND SETTING TO DRAG ME AFTER HIM
2518-154825-0052 NOW I WAS SO BESOTTED WITH FRIGHT THAT I WOULD NOT BUDGE AN INCH FEARING TO FALL OVER IF I OPENED MY EYES AND ELZEVIR FOR ALL HE WAS SO STRONG COULD NOT PULL A HELPLESS LUMP BACKWARDS UP THAT PATH
2518-154825-0053 SO HE GAVE IT UP LEAVING GO HOLD ON ME WITH A GROAN AND AT THAT MOMENT THERE ROSE FROM THE UNDER CLIFF BELOW A SOUND OF VOICES AND SHOUTING ZOUNDS THEY ARE DOWN ALREADY CRIED ELZEVIR AND HAVE FOUND MASKEW'S BODY
2518-154825-0054 IT IS ALL UP ANOTHER MINUTE AND THEY WILL SEE US BUT SO STRANGE IS THE FORCE OF MIND ON BODY AND THE POWER OF A GREATER TO MASTER A LESSER FEAR THAT WHEN I HEARD THOSE VOICES FROM BELOW ALL FRIGHT OF FALLING LEFT ME IN A MOMENT
2518-154825-0055 AND I COULD OPEN MY EYES WITHOUT A TRACE OF GIDDINESS SO I BEGAN TO MOVE FORWARD AGAIN ON HANDS AND KNEES AND ELZEVIR
2518-154825-0056 THINKING THAT WE WERE HIDING BY THE SEA FIVE MINUTES LATER ELZEVIR STEPPED ON TO THE CLIFF TOP WITH ME UPON HIS BACK WE HAVE MADE SOMETHING OF THIS THROW HE SAID AND ARE SAFE FOR ANOTHER HOUR THOUGH I THOUGHT THY GIDDY HEAD HAD RUINED US
2518-154826-0000 THE DAY WAS STILL YOUNG AND FAR BELOW US WAS STRETCHED THE MOVING FLOOR OF THE CHANNEL WITH A SILVER GREY FILM OF NIGHT MISTS NOT YET LIFTED IN THE OFFING A HUMMOCKY UP AND DOWN LINE OF CLIFFS
2518-154826-0001 WITH THE STRAIGHT SUNPATH ACROSS IT SPANGLED AND GLEAMING LIKE A MACKEREL'S BACK THE RELIEF OF BEING ONCE MORE ON FIRM GROUND AND THE EXULTATION OF AN ESCAPE FROM IMMEDIATE DANGER REMOVED MY PAIN AND MADE ME FORGET THAT MY LEG WAS BROKEN
2518-154826-0002 AND THE WIND WHICH A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THREATENED TO BLOW ME FROM THAT NARROW LEDGE SEEMED NOW BUT THE GENTLEST OF BREEZES FRESH WITH THE BREATH OF THE KINDLY SEA BUT THIS WAS ONLY FOR A MOMENT FOR THE ANGUISH CAME BACK AND GREW APACE
2518-154826-0003 AND I FELL TO THINKING DISMALLY OF THE PLIGHT WE WERE IN HOW THINGS HAD BEEN AGAINST US IN THESE LAST DAYS FIRST THERE WAS LOSING THE WHY NOT AND THAT WAS BAD ENOUGH SECOND
2518-154826-0004 THERE WAS THE BEING KNOWN BY THE EXCISE FOR SMUGGLERS AND PERHAPS FOR MURDERERS THIRD AND LAST THERE WAS THE BREAKING OF MY LEG WHICH MADE ESCAPE SO DIFFICULT BUT MOST OF ALL
2518-154826-0005 THERE CAME BEFORE MY EYES THAT GREY FACE TURNED UP AGAINST THE MORNING SUN AND I THOUGHT OF ALL IT MEANT FOR GRACE AND WOULD HAVE GIVEN MY OWN LIFE TO CALL BACK THAT OF OUR WORST ENEMY THEN ELZEVIR SAT UP STRETCHING HIMSELF LIKE ONE WAKING OUT OF SLEEP
2518-154826-0006 AND SAID WE MUST BE GONE THEY WILL NOT BE BACK FOR SOME TIME YET AND WHEN THEY COME WILL NOT THINK TO SEARCH CLOSELY FOR US HEREABOUTS BUT THAT WE CANNOT RISK AND MUST GET CLEAR AWAY
2518-154826-0007 THIS LEG OF THINE WILL KEEP US TIED FOR WEEKS AND WE MUST FIND SOME PLACE WHERE WE CAN LIE HID AND TEND IT NOW I KNOW SUCH A HIDING HOLE IN PURBECK WHICH THEY CALL JOSEPH'S PIT AND THITHER WE MUST GO BUT IT WILL TAKE ALL THE DAY TO GET THERE
2518-154826-0008 AND SO HE TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS AGAIN AND STARTED OFF ACROSS THE FIELDS I NEED NOT TELL OF THAT WEARY JOURNEY AND INDEED COULD NOT IF I WISHED FOR THE PAIN WENT TO MY HEAD AND FILLED ME WITH SUCH A DROWSY ANGUISH
2518-154826-0009 THAT I KNEW NOTHING EXCEPT WHEN SOME UNLOOKED FOR MOVEMENT GAVE ME A SHARPER TWINGE AND MADE ME CRY OUT AT FIRST ELZEVIR WALKED BRISKLY BUT AS THE DAY WORE ON WENT SLOWER
2518-154826-0010 IT WAS AFTER NOON FOR THE SUN WAS PAST THE MERIDIAN AND VERY HOT FOR THE TIME OF YEAR WHEN THE FACE OF THE COUNTRY BEGAN TO CHANGE AND INSTEAD OF THE SHORT SWARD OF THE OPEN DOWN SPRINKLED WITH TINY WHITE SNAIL SHELLS
2518-154826-0011 THE GROUND WAS BRASHY WITH FLAT STONES AND DIVIDED UP INTO TILLAGE FIELDS IT WAS A BLEAK WIDE BITTEN PLACE ENOUGH LOOKING AS IF TWOULD NEVER PAY FOR TURNING AND INSTEAD OF HEDGES THERE WERE DREARY WALLS BUILT OF DRY STONE WITHOUT MORTAR
2518-154826-0012 BEHIND ONE OF THESE WALLS BROKEN DOWN IN PLACES BUT HELD TOGETHER WITH STRAGGLING IVY AND BUTTRESSED HERE AND THERE WITH A BRAMBLE BUSH ELZEVIR PUT ME DOWN AT LENGTH AND SAID I AM BEAT AND CAN CARRY THEE NO FARTHER FOR THIS PRESENT
2518-154826-0013 THOUGH THERE IS NOT NOW MUCH FARTHER TO GO WE HAVE PASSED PURBECK GATES AND THESE WALLS WILL SCREEN US FROM PRYING EYES IF ANY CHANCE COMER PASS ALONG THE DOWN AND AS FOR THE SOLDIERS THEY ARE NOT LIKE TO COME THIS WAY SO SOON
2518-154826-0014 AND IF THEY COME I CANNOT HELP IT FOR WEARINESS AND THE SUN'S HEAT HAVE MADE MY FEET LIKE LEAD A SCORE OF YEARS AGO I WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT SUCH A TASK BUT NOW TIS DIFFERENT
2518-154826-0015 SO SIT THEE HERE AND LEAN THY SHOULDER UP AGAINST THE WALL AND THUS THOU CANST LOOK THROUGH THIS BROKEN PLACE AND WATCH BOTH WAYS THEN IF THOU SEE AUGHT MOVING WAKE ME UP
2518-154826-0016 I WISH I HAD A THIMBLEFUL OF POWDER TO MAKE THIS WHISTLE SOUND' AND HE TOOK MASKEW'S SILVER BUTTED PISTOL AGAIN FROM HIS BOSOM AND HANDLED IT LOVINGLY
2518-154826-0017 WITH THAT HE FLUNG HIMSELF DOWN WHERE THERE WAS A NARROW SHADOW CLOSE AGAINST THE BOTTOM OF THE WALL AND IN A MINUTE I KNEW FROM HIS HEAVY BREATHING THAT HE WAS ASLEEP THE WIND HAD FRESHENED MUCH AND WAS BLOWING STRONG FROM THE WEST
2518-154826-0018 AND NOW THAT I WAS UNDER THE LEE OF THE WALL
2518-154826-0019 AND GETS AT LENGTH INTO SHELTER MOREOVER THOUGH I WAS NOT TIRED BY GRIEVOUS TOIL LIKE ELZEVIR I HAD PASSED A NIGHT WITHOUT SLEEP AND FELT BESIDES THE WEARINESS OF PAIN TO LULL ME TO SLUMBER
2518-154826-0020 THEN I SOUGHT SOMETHING TO FIX MY THOUGHTS AND LOOKING ON THAT SIDE OF THE WALL WHERE THE SWARD WAS FELL TO COUNTING THE MOLE HILLS THAT WERE CAST UP IN NUMBERS THEREABOUT AND WHEN I HAD EXHAUSTED THEM AND RECKONED UP THIRTY LITTLE HEAPS OF DRY AND POWDERY BROWN EARTH
2518-154826-0021 THAT LAY AT RANDOM ON THE GREEN TURF I TURNED MY EYES TO THE TILLAGE FIELD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL AND SAW THE INCH HIGH BLADES OF CORN COMING UP BETWEEN THE STONES THEN I FELL TO COUNTING THE BLADES FEELING GLAD TO HAVE DISCOVERED A RECKONING THAT WOULD NOT BE EXHAUSTED AT THIRTY
2518-154826-0022 BUT WOULD GO ON FOR MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND BEFORE I HAD REACHED TEN IN SO HEROIC A NUMERATION WAS FAST ASLEEP A SHARP NOISE WOKE ME WITH A START THAT SET THE PAIN TINGLING IN MY LEG
2518-154826-0023 AND THOUGH I COULD SEE NOTHING I KNEW THAT A SHOT HAD BEEN FIRED VERY NEAR US I WAS FOR WAKING ELZEVIR BUT HE WAS ALREADY FULL AWAKE AND PUT A FINGER ON HIS LIP TO SHOW I SHOULD NOT SPEAK THEN
2518-154826-0024 ENOUGH FOR HIM TO LOOK THROUGH THE LEAVES WITHOUT BEING SEEN HE DROPPED DOWN AGAIN WITH A LOOK OF RELIEF AND SAID TIS BUT A LAD SCARING ROOKS WITH A BLUNDERBUSS WE WILL NOT STIR UNLESS HE MAKES THIS WAY A MINUTE LATER HE SAID THE BOY IS COMING STRAIGHT FOR THE WALL
2518-154826-0025 WE SHALL HAVE TO SHOW OURSELVES AND WHILE HE SPOKE THERE WAS A RATTLE OF FALLING STONES WHERE THE BOY WAS PARTLY CLIMBING AND PARTLY PULLING DOWN THE DRY WALL AND SO ELZEVIR STOOD UP THE BOY LOOKED FRIGHTENED AND MADE AS IF HE WOULD RUN OFF
2518-154826-0026 BUT ELZEVIR PASSED HIM THE TIME OF DAY IN A CIVIL VOICE AND HE STOPPED AND GAVE IT BACK WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE SON BLOCK ASKED SCARING ROOKS FOR FARMER TOPP WAS THE ANSWER
2518-154826-0027 HAVE YOU GOT A CHARGE OF POWDER TO SPARE SAID ELZEVIR SHOWING HIS PISTOL I WANT TO GET A RABBIT IN THE GORSE FOR SUPPER AND HAVE DROPPED MY FLASK MAYBE YOU'VE SEEN A FLASK IN WALKING THROUGH THE FURROWS HE WHISPERED TO ME TO LIE STILL
2518-154826-0028 NO TIME WAS WASTED IN WORDS ELZEVIR HAD THE FLASK IN HIS POCKET AND THE BOY WAS BITING THE CROWN WHAT SHOT HAVE YOU SAID ELZEVIR WHAT HAVE YOU DROPPED YOUR SHOT FLASK TOO ASKED THE BOY
2518-154826-0029 AND HIS VOICE HAD SOMETHING OF SURPRISE IN IT NAY BUT MY SHOT ARE OVER SMALL
2518-154826-0030 BUT THOU MUST PAY A SHILLING FOR THEM MY MASTER SAYS I NEVER AM TO USE THEM EXCEPT I SEE A SWAN OR BUZZARD OR SOMETHING FIT TO COOK COME OVER I SHALL GET A SOUND BEATING FOR MY PAINS AND TO BE BEAT IS WORTH A SHILLING IF THOU ART BEAT BE BEAT FOR SOMETHING MORE SAYS ELZEVIR THE TEMPTER
2518-154826-0031 THE SMUGGLERS GOT OFF CLEAR BUT THEY SAY THE HUE AND CRY IS UP ALREADY AND THAT A HEAD PRICE WILL BE FIXED OF TWENTY POUND SO IF I SELL YOU A FOWLING PIECE MAYBE I SHALL DO WRONG AND HAVE THE GOVERNMENT UPON ME AS WELL AS MY MASTER THE SURPRISE IN HIS VOICE WAS CHANGED TO SUSPICION
2518-154826-0032 FOR WHILE HE SPOKE I SAW THAT HIS EYE HAD FALLEN ON MY FOOT THOUGH I TRIED TO KEEP IT IN THE SHADOW AND THAT HE SAW THE BOOT CLOTTED WITH BLOOD AND THE KERCHIEF TIED ROUND MY LEG TIS FOR THAT VERY REASON SAYS ELZEVIR THAT I WANT THE FIRELOCK
2518-154826-0033 THESE SMUGGLERS ARE ROAMING LOOSE AND A PISTOL IS A POOR THING TO STOP SUCH WICKED RASCALS ON A LONE HILL SIDE COME COME THOU DOST NOT WANT A PIECE TO GUARD THEE THEY WILL NOT HURT A BOY HE HAD THE GUINEA BETWEEN HIS FINGER AND THUMB
2518-154826-0034 AND SO I SAID AS MUCH TO ELZEVIR WHO ONLY LAUGHED SAYING THE BOY WAS SIMPLE AND HARMLESS BUT FROM WHERE I SAT I COULD PEEP OUT THROUGH THE BRAMBLES IN THE OPEN GAP AND SEE WITHOUT BEING SEEN AND THERE WAS MY YOUNG GENTLEMAN WALKING CARELESSLY ENOUGH
2518-154826-0035 BUT WHEN ELZEVIR SAT DOWN THE BOY GAVE A CAREFUL LOOK ROUND AND SEEING NO ONE WATCHING ANY MORE
2518-154826-0036 THEN I KNEW THAT HE HAD GUESSED WHO WE WERE AND WAS OFF TO WARN THE HUE AND CRY BUT BEFORE ELZEVIR WAS ON HIS FEET AGAIN THE BOY WAS OUT OF SIGHT OVER THE HILL BROW LET US MOVE ON SAID BLOCK TIS BUT A LITTLE DISTANCE NOW TO GO AND THE HEAT IS PAST ALREADY
2518-154826-0037 WE MUST HAVE SLEPT THREE HOURS OR MORE FOR THOU ART BUT A SORRY WATCHMAN JOHN TIS WHEN THE SENTRY SLEEPS THAT THE ENEMY LAUGHS AND FOR THEE THE POSSE MIGHT HAVE HAD US BOTH LIKE DAYLIGHT OWLS WITH THAT HE TOOK ME ON HIS BACK AND MADE OFF WITH A LUSTY STRIDE
2518-154826-0038 AND IN THE SHELTER OF THE WALLS WE HAD SLEPT LONGER THAN WE THOUGHT FOR THE SUN WAS WESTERING FAST AND THOUGH THE REST HAD REFRESHED ME MY LEG HAD GROWN STIFF AND HURT THE MORE IN DANGLING WHEN WE STARTED AGAIN
2518-154826-0039 ELZEVIR WAS STILL WALKING STRONGLY IN SPITE OF THE HEAVY BURDEN HE CARRIED AND IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR I KNEW THOUGH I HAD NEVER BEEN THERE BEFORE WE WERE IN THE LAND OF THE OLD MARBLE QUARRIES AT THE BACK OF ANVIL POINT
2518-154826-0040 ALTHOUGH I KNEW LITTLE OF THESE QUARRIES AND CERTAINLY WAS IN EVIL PLIGHT TO TAKE NOTE OF ANYTHING AT THAT TIME YET AFTERWARDS I LEARNT MUCH ABOUT THEM OUT OF SUCH EXCAVATIONS COMES THAT BLACK PURBECK MARBLE WHICH YOU SEE IN OLD CHURCHES IN OUR COUNTRY
2518-154826-0041 AND I AM TOLD IN OTHER PARTS OF ENGLAND AS WELL AND THE WAY OF MAKING A MARBLE QUARRY IS TO SINK A TUNNEL SLANTING VERY STEEPLY DOWN INTO THE EARTH LIKE A WELL TURNED ASKEW TILL YOU REACH FIFTY SEVENTY OR PERHAPS ONE HUNDRED FEET DEEP THEN
2518-154826-0042 FROM THE BOTTOM OF THIS SHAFT THERE SPREAD OUT NARROW PASSAGES OR TUNNELS MOSTLY SIX FEET HIGH BUT SOMETIMES ONLY THREE OR FOUR AND IN THESE THE MARBLE IS DUG THESE QUARRIES WERE MADE BY MEN CENTURIES AGO SOME SAY BY THE ROMANS THEMSELVES
2518-154826-0043 WHICH WAS JUST PUTTING ON THE BRIGHTER GREEN OF SPRING THIS TURF WAS NOT SMOOTH BUT HUMMOCKY FOR UNDER IT LAY HEAPS OF WORTHLESS STONE AND MARBLE DRAWN OUT OF THE QUARRIES AGES AGO WHICH THE GREEN VESTMENT HAD COVERED FOR THE MOST PART
2518-154826-0044 THOUGH IT LEFT SOMETIMES A LITTLE PATCH OF BROKEN RUBBLE PEERING OUT AT THE TOP OF A MOUND THERE WERE MANY TUMBLE DOWN WALLS AND LOW GABLES LEFT OF THE COTTAGES OF THE OLD QUARRYMEN GRASS COVERED RIDGES MARKED OUT THE LITTLE GARDEN FOLDS
2518-154826-0045 AND HERE AND THERE STILL STOOD A FORLORN GOOSEBERRY BUSH
2518-154826-0046 ON WHICH THE MARBLE BLOCKS WERE ONCE HAULED UP BY WOODEN WINCHES DOWN THESE STEPS NO FEET EVER WALKED NOW FOR NOT ONLY WERE SUFFOCATING GASES SAID TO BESET THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFTS
2518-154826-0047 FOR IF IT WERE NOT FOR THIS HOLY PURPOSE THE MANDRIVE WOULD HAVE POWER TO STRANGLE THE MAN THAT HEWED IT IT WAS BY THE SIDE OF ONE OF THESE OLD SHAFTS THAT ELZEVIR LAID ME DOWN AT LAST THE LIGHT WAS VERY LOW
2518-154826-0048 AND THE SWARD CREPT OVER THE EDGES OF THE HOLE AND EVERY CRACK AND CREVICE IN STEPS AND SLIDE WAS GREEN WITH FERNS THE GREEN FERNS SHROUDED THE WALLS OF THE HOLE AND RUDDY BROWN BRAMBLES OVERGREW THE STEPS
2518-154826-0049 THERE HE SAID THIS IS JOSEPH'S PIT AND HERE WE MUST LIE HID UNTIL THY FOOT IS SOUND AGAIN ONCE GET TO THE BOTTOM SAFE AND WE CAN LAUGH AT POSSE AND HUE AND CRY
2518-154826-0050 AND BEFORE THEY COME TO WHERE WE LIE WE CAN HOLD THE TROOP AT BAY AND SELL OUR LIVES SO DEAR THEY WILL NOT CARE TO BUY THEM WE WAITED A FEW MINUTES AND THEN HE TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS AND BEGAN TO DESCEND THE STEPS BACK FIRST AS ONE GOES DOWN A HATCHWAY
2518-154826-0051 AND HOW FAR OFF WE WERE NOW AND HOW LONG IT WAS LIKELY TO BE BEFORE I SAW THAT DEAR VILLAGE AND GRACE AGAIN THE STAIRS WERE STILL SHARP CUT AND LITTLE WORN BUT ELZEVIR PAID GREAT CARE TO HIS FEET LEST HE SHOULD SLIP ON THE FERNS AND MOSSES WITH WHICH THEY WERE OVERGROWN
2518-154826-0052 HE SHOVED THEM ASIDE WITH HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND SCREENED MY DANGLING LEG FROM GETTING CAUGHT THUS HE CAME SAFE WITHOUT STUMBLE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PIT WHEN WE GOT THERE ALL WAS DARK BUT HE STEPPED OFF INTO A NARROW OPENING ON THE RIGHT HAND
2518-154826-0053 AND WALKED ON AS IF HE KNEW THE WAY I COULD SEE NOTHING BUT PERCEIVED THAT WE WERE PASSING THROUGH ENDLESS GALLERIES CUT IN THE SOLID ROCK HIGH ENOUGH FOR THE MOST PART TO ALLOW OF WALKING UPRIGHT BUT SOMETIMES SO LOW AS TO FORCE HIM TO BEND DOWN
2518-154826-0054 AND CARRY ME IN A VERY CONSTRAINED ATTITUDE ONLY TWICE DID HE SET ME DOWN AT A TURNING WHILE HE TOOK OUT HIS TINDER BOX AND LIT A MATCH
254-12312-0000 POOR MORTALS WHO WAIT FOR A HAPPY DAY CHEER UP YOUR HEARTS
254-12312-0001 IF IT BE LAWFUL FIRMLY TO BELIEVE
254-12312-0002 THOUGH IT BE AT HAND YEA AND BEFORE THERE SHALL APPEAR A RACE OF MEN WHO LOTH TO SIT STILL IN ONE PLACE SHALL BOLDLY GO BEFORE ALL PEOPLE'S EYES SUBORNING MEN OF DIVERS QUALITIES TO DRAW THEM
254-12312-0003 AND CHILDREN THEIR OWN PARENTS IN A WORD ALL REVERENCE SHALL THEN BE BANISHED NO TRUE RESPECT TO OTHER SHALL BE HAD THEY'LL SAY THAT EVERY MAN SHOULD HAVE HIS TURN BOTH IN HIS GOING FORTH AND HIS RETURN
254-12312-0004 SUCH WOES SUCH JARRINGS
254-12312-0005 THAT NEVER WERE IN HISTORY SUCH COILS SET DOWN AS YET SUCH TUMULTS AND GARBOILS
254-12312-0006 WHO TRUSTING TOO MUCH IN THEIR HOPEFUL TIME LIVE BUT A WHILE AND PERISH IN THEIR PRIME NEITHER SHALL ANY WHO THIS COURSE SHALL RUN LEAVE OFF THE RACE WHICH HE HATH ONCE BEGUN
254-12312-0007 THE VERIEST LOUT OF ALL SHALL BE THEIR JUDGE O HORRIBLE AND DANGEROUS DELUGE DELUGE I CALL IT AND THAT FOR GOOD REASON FOR THIS SHALL BE OMITTED IN NO SEASON
254-12312-0008 BECAUSE THEY DID NOT SPARE THE FLOCKS OF BEASTS THAT INNOCENTEST ARE BUT DID THEIR SINEWS AND THEIR BOWELS TAKE NOT TO THE GODS A SACRIFICE TO MAKE BUT USUALLY TO SERVE THEMSELVES FOR SPORT
254-12312-0009 AND NOW CONSIDER I DO YOU EXHORT IN SUCH COMMOTIONS SO CONTINUAL WHAT REST CAN TAKE THE GLOBE TERRESTRIAL MOST HAPPY THEN ARE THEY THAT CAN IT HOLD AND USE IT CAREFULLY AS PRECIOUS GOLD
254-12312-0010 BY KEEPING IT IN GAOL WHENCE IT SHALL HAVE NO HELP BUT HIM WHO BEING TO IT GAVE AND TO INCREASE HIS MOURNFUL ACCIDENT
254-12312-0011 SHALL CEASE TO DART UPON IT ANY LIGHT MORE THAN IN AN ECLIPSE OR IN THE NIGHT SO THAT AT ONCE ITS FAVOUR SHALL BE GONE AND LIBERTY WITH IT BE LEFT ALONE AND YET BEFORE IT COME TO RUIN THUS
254-12312-0012 INARIME DID NOT MORE QUICKLY MOVE WHEN TYPHEUS DID THE VAST HUGE HILLS REMOVE AND FOR DESPITE INTO THE SEA THEM THREW THUS SHALL IT THEN BE LOST BY WAYS NOT FEW
254-12312-0013 AND YET BEFORE THAT THEY BE CLEAN DISPERST
254-12312-0014 O HE IS WORTHY PRAISE THAT SHRINKETH NOT NO SOONER WAS THIS ENIGMATICAL MONUMENT READ OVER BUT GARGANTUA FETCHING A VERY DEEP SIGH SAID UNTO THOSE THAT STOOD BY
254-12312-0015 ARE PERSECUTED BUT HAPPY IS THAT MAN THAT SHALL NOT BE SCANDALIZED BUT SHALL ALWAYS CONTINUE TO THE END IN AIMING AT THAT MARK WHICH GOD BY HIS DEAR SON HATH SET BEFORE US
254-12312-0016 WITHOUT BEING DISTRACTED OR DIVERTED BY HIS CARNAL AFFECTIONS AND DEPRAVED NATURE THE MONK THEN SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK IN YOUR CONSCIENCE IS MEANT AND SIGNIFIED BY THIS RIDDLE WHAT
254-12312-0017 SAID GARGANTUA THE PROGRESS AND CARRYING ON OF THE DIVINE TRUTH BY SAINT GODERAN SAID THE MONK THAT IS NOT MY EXPOSITION IT IS THE STYLE OF THE PROPHET MERLIN
254-12312-0018 MAKE UPON IT AS MANY GRAVE ALLEGORIES AND GLOSSES AS YOU WILL AND DOTE UPON IT YOU AND THE REST OF THE WORLD AS LONG AS YOU PLEASE FOR MY PART
254-12312-0019 IN DARK AND OBSCURE TERMS THE SUBORNERS OF MEN ARE THE MAKERS OF MATCHES WHICH ARE COMMONLY FRIENDS AFTER THE TWO CHASES ARE MADE HE THAT WAS IN THE UPPER END OF THE TENNIS COURT GOETH OUT
254-12312-0020 AND THE OTHER COMETH IN THEY BELIEVE THE FIRST THAT SAITH THE BALL WAS OVER OR UNDER THE LINE THE WATERS ARE THE HEATS THAT THE PLAYERS TAKE TILL THEY SWEAT AGAIN THE CORDS OF THE RACKETS ARE MADE OF THE GUTS OF SHEEP OR GOATS
254-12312-0021 THE GLOBE TERRESTRIAL IS THE TENNIS BALL AFTER PLAYING WHEN THE GAME IS DONE THEY REFRESH THEMSELVES BEFORE A CLEAR FIRE AND CHANGE THEIR SHIRTS AND VERY WILLINGLY THEY MAKE ALL GOOD CHEER
254-127705-0000 THE YOSEMITE OR GRIZZLY BEAR TRIBE FANCYING THEMSELVES SECURE IN THEIR DEEP MOUNTAIN STRONGHOLD WERE THE MOST TROUBLESOME AND DEFIANT OF ALL AND IT WAS WHILE THE MARIPOSA BATTALION UNDER COMMAND OF MAJOR SAVAGE
254-127705-0001 WAS TRYING TO CAPTURE THIS WARLIKE TRIBE AND CONDUCT THEM TO THE FRESNO RESERVATION THAT THEIR DEEP MOUNTAIN HOME THE YOSEMITE VALLEY WAS DISCOVERED
254-127705-0002 INSTRUCTING THEM TO TELL THE INDIANS THAT IF THEY WOULD COME IN AND MAKE TREATY WITH THE COMMISSIONERS THEY WOULD BE FURNISHED WITH FOOD AND CLOTHING AND BE PROTECTED BUT IF THEY DID NOT COME IN HE WOULD MAKE WAR UPON THEM AND KILL THEM ALL
254-127705-0003 INFORMED HIM OF THE WISHES OF THE COMMISSIONERS BUT THE OLD CHIEF WAS VERY SUSPICIOUS OF SAVAGE AND FEARED THAT HE WAS TAKING THIS METHOD OF GETTING THE TRIBE INTO HIS POWER FOR THE PURPOSE OF REVENGING HIS PERSONAL WRONG
254-127705-0004 TENAYA INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF TAKING ALL THE INDIANS TO THE SAN JOAQUIN PLAIN MY PEOPLE
254-127705-0005 MY YOUNG MEN HAVE SOMETIMES TAKEN HORSES AND MULES FROM THE WHITES
254-127705-0006 MY YOUNG MEN BELIEVED THAT THE GOLD DIGGERS WERE OUR ENEMIES
254-127705-0007 AND WE SHALL BE GLAD TO LIVE IN PEACE WITH THEM WE WILL STAY HERE AND BE FRIENDS MY PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO GO TO THE PLAINS SOME OF THE TRIBES WHO HAVE GONE THERE ARE VERY BAD WE CANNOT LIVE WITH THEM HERE WE CAN DEFEND OURSELVES
254-127705-0008 TO THE MAJOR SAVAGE FIRMLY SAID YOUR PEOPLE MUST GO TO THE COMMISSIONERS IF THEY DO NOT YOUR YOUNG MEN WILL AGAIN STEAL HORSES AND KILL AND PLUNDER THE WHITES
254-127705-0009 IT WAS YOUR PEOPLE WHO ROBBED MY STORES BURNED MY HOUSES AND MURDERED MY MEN IT THEY DO NOT MAKE A TREATY YOUR WHOLE TRIBE WILL BE DESTROYED NOT ONE OF THEM WILL BE LEFT ALIVE TO THIS THE OLD CHIEF REPLIED
254-127705-0010 IT IS USELESS TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHO DESTROYED YOUR PROPERTY AND KILLED YOUR PEOPLE I AM OLD AND YOU CAN KILL ME IF YOU WILL BUT IT IS USELESS TO LIE TO YOU WHO KNOW MORE THAN ALL THE INDIANS
254-127705-0011 THEREFORE I WILL NOT LIE TO YOU BUT IF YOU WILL LET ME RETURN TO MY PEOPLE I WILL BRING THEM IN HE WAS ALLOWED TO GO THE NEXT DAY HE CAME BACK
254-127705-0012 AND SAID HIS PEOPLE WERE ON THE WAY TO OUR CAMP TO GO WITH THE MEN SENT BY THE GREAT FATHER WHO WAS SO GOOD AND RICH ANOTHER DAY PASSED BUT NO INDIANS FROM THE DEEP VALLEY APPEARED
254-127705-0013 AFTER WAITING STILL ANOTHER DAY THE EXPEDITION STARTED FOR THE VALLEY WHEN TENAYA WAS QUESTIONED AS TO THE ROUTE AND DISTANCE HE SAID THAT THE SNOW WAS SO DEEP THAT THE HORSES COULD NOT GO THROUGH IT
254-127705-0014 SAVAGE TOLD TENAYA THAT HE WAS NOT TELLING THE TRUTH FOR INDIANS COULD NOT CROSS THE MOUNTAINS IN THE DEEP SNOW AND THAT HE KNEW THEY MUST STILL BE AT HIS VILLAGE OR HIDING SOMEWHERE NEAR IT
254-127705-0015 TO SEE YOUR PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT COME THEY WILL COME IF I FIND THEM YOU WILL NOT FIND ANY OF MY PEOPLE THERE SAID TENAYA I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THEY ARE MY TRIBE IS SMALL
254-127705-0016 MANY OF THE PEOPLE OF MY TRIBE HAVE COME FROM OTHER TRIBES AND IF THEY GO TO THE PLAINS AND ARE SEEN THEY WILL BE KILLED BY THE FRIENDS OF THOSE WITH WHOM THEY HAVE QUARRELED I WAS TOLD THAT I WAS GROWING OLD AND IT WAS WELL THAT I SHOULD GO
254-127705-0017 BUT THAT YOUNG AND STRONG MEN CAN FIND PLENTY IN THE MOUNTAINS THEREFORE WHY SHOULD THEY GO TO THE HOT PLAINS TO BE PENNED UP LIKE HORSES AND CATTLE MY HEART HAS BEEN SORE SINCE THAT TALK
254-127705-0018 BUT I AM NOW WILLING TO GO FOR IT IS BEST FOR MY PEOPLE PUSHING AHEAD TAKING TURNS IN BREAKING A WAY THROUGH THE SNOW THEY ARRIVED IN SIGHT OF THE GREAT VALLEY EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON
254-127705-0019 AND GUIDED BY ONE OF TENAYA'S INDIANS DESCENDED BY THE SAME ROUTE AS THAT FOLLOWED BY THE MARIPOSA TRAIL AND THE WEARY PARTY WENT INTO CAMP ON THE RIVER BANK OPPOSITE EL CAPITAN AFTER SUPPER SEATED AROUND A BIG FIRE
254-127705-0020 POHONO THE BRIDAL VEIL BEING THE PRINCIPAL ONE THE EXPEDITION REMAINED ONLY ONE DAY AND TWO NIGHTS IN THE VALLEY HURRYING OUT ON THE APPROACH OF A STORM AND REACHED THE SOUTH FORK HEADQUARTERS
254-127705-0021 ON THE EVENING OF THE THIRD DAY AFTER STARTING OUT
254-127705-0022 MOST OF IT HAD BEEN EXPLORED IN A GENERAL WAY AND SOME OF ITS PRINCIPAL FEATURES HAD BEEN NAMED BUT THE INDIANS HAD FLED UP THE TENAYA CANYON TRAIL AND NONE OF THEM WERE SEEN EXCEPT AN OLD WOMAN UNABLE TO FOLLOW THE FUGITIVES
254-127705-0023 A SECOND EXPEDITION WAS MADE IN THE SAME YEAR UNDER COMMAND OF MAJOR BOLING WHEN THE VALLEY WAS ENTERED NO INDIANS WERE SEEN BUT THE MANY WIGWAMS WITH SMOLDERING FIRES
254-127705-0024 SHOWED THAT THEY HAD BEEN HURRIEDLY ABANDONED THAT VERY DAY LATER FIVE YOUNG INDIANS WHO HAD BEEN LEFT TO WATCH THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EXPEDITION WERE CAPTURED AT THE FOOT OF THE THREE BROTHERS AFTER A LIVELY CHASE
254-127705-0025 THAT SAME DAY THE OLD CHIEF WAS CAPTURED ON THE CLIFF ON THE EAST SIDE OF INDIAN CANYON BY SOME OF BOLING'S SCOUTS AS TENAYA WALKED TOWARD THE CAMP HIS EYE FELL UPON THE DEAD BODY OF HIS FAVORITE SON CAPTAIN BOLING
254-127705-0026 THROUGH AN INTERPRETER EXPRESSED HIS REGRET AT THE OCCURRENCE BUT NOT A WORD DID TENAYA UTTER IN REPLY LATER
254-127705-0027 BUT WAS CAUGHT AS HE WAS ABOUT TO SWIM ACROSS THE RIVER
254-127705-0028 AND WHEN BROUGHT INTO THE PRESENCE OF CAPTAIN BOLING HE SAID IN GREAT EMOTION KILL ME SIR CAPTAIN YES KILL ME AS YOU KILLED MY SON AS YOU WOULD KILL MY PEOPLE IF THEY WERE TO COME TO YOU
254-127705-0029 BUT WAIT A LITTLE AND WHEN I AM DEAD I WILL CALL MY PEOPLE TO COME AND THEY SHALL HEAR ME IN THEIR SLEEP AND COME TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THEIR CHIEF AND HIS SON YES SIR AMERICA MY SPIRIT WILL MAKE TROUBLE FOR YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE
254-127705-0030 THIS LED TO ANOTHER YOSEMITE EXPEDITION A DETACHMENT OF REGULAR SOLDIERS FROM FORT MILLER UNDER LIEUTENANT MOORE U S A WAS AT ONCE DISPATCHED TO CAPTURE OR PUNISH THE MURDERERS
254-127705-0031 WHEN THE CAPTIVES WERE ACCUSED OF THE MURDER OF THE TWO WHITE MEN THEY ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD KILLED THEM TO PREVENT WHITE MEN FROM COMING TO THEIR VALLEY DECLARING THAT IT WAS THEIR HOME AND THAT WHITE MEN HAD NO RIGHT TO COME THERE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT
254-127705-0032 TO THIS THEY REPLIED THAT TENAYA HAD NEVER CONSENTED TO THE SALE OF THEIR VALLEY AND HAD NEVER RECEIVED PAY FOR IT THE OTHER CHIEF THEY SAID HAD NO RIGHT TO SELL THEIR TERRITORY
254-127705-0033 THE LIEUTENANT BEING FULLY SATISFIED THAT HE HAD CAPTURED THE REAL MURDERERS PROMPTLY PRONOUNCED JUDGMENT AND HAD THEM PLACED IN LINE AND SHOT LIEUTENANT MOORE PURSUED THE FUGITIVES TO MONO BUT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING ANY OF THEM
254-127705-0034 THEY STOLE A NUMBER OF STOLEN HORSES FROM THEIR ENTERTAINERS AND MADE THEIR WAY BY A LONG OBSCURE ROUTE BY THE HEAD OF THE NORTH FORK OF THE SAN JOAQUIN
254-127705-0035 BUT EARLY ONE MORNING AFTER A FEAST OF HORSE FLESH A BAND OF MONOS SURPRISED THEM IN THEIR HUTS KILLING TENAYA AND NEARLY ALL HIS TRIBE ONLY A SMALL REMNANT ESCAPED DOWN THE RIVER CANYON
254-127705-0036 WHEN MISTER J M HUTCHINGS HAVING HEARD OF ITS WONDERFUL SCENERY COLLECTED A PARTY AND MADE THE FIRST REGULAR TOURIST'S VISIT TO THE YOSEMITE
254-127705-0037 DESCRIBED IT IN ARTICLES ILLUSTRATED BY A GOOD ARTIST WHO WAS TAKEN INTO THE VALLEY BY HIM FOR THAT PURPOSE
254-127705-0038 CONSISTING OF SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN PERSONS THE NEXT YEAR THE REGULAR PLEASURE TRAVEL BEGAN AND A TRAIL ON THE MARIPOSA SIDE OF THE VALLEY WAS OPENED BY MANN BROTHERS THIS TRAIL WAS AFTERWARDS PURCHASED BY THE CITIZENS OF THE COUNTY
254-127705-0039 THE FIRST HOUSE BUILT IN THE YOSEMITE VALLEY WAS ERECTED IN THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX AND WAS KEPT AS A HOTEL THE NEXT YEAR BY G A HITE AND LATER BY J H NEAL AND S M CUNNINGHAM
254-127705-0040 BY MISTER HUTCHINGS ALL THESE HOTELS HAVE VANISHED EXCEPT THE FRAME HOUSE BUILT IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE WHICH HAS BEEN CHANGED BEYOND RECOGNITION A LARGE HOTEL BUILT ON THE BRINK OF THE RIVER IN FRONT OF THE OLD ONE
254-127705-0041 AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT BY ACT OF CONGRESS IN EIGHTEEN NINETY OF THE YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK AND THE RECESSION IN NINETEEN O FIVE OF THE ORIGINAL RESERVATION TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY THE STATE
254-127705-0042 TO THE BORDER OF THE PARK EIGHT MILES BELOW THE VALLEY IT IS EIGHTY MILES LONG
254-145458-0000 IS GUARDED JEALOUSLY FROM ALL BUT A FEW INTIMATES THE SECRET TO TAKE A CONTRARY CASE OF OUR INFALLIBLE REMEDY FOR SEASICKNESS IS THRUST UPON EVERY TRAVELLER WE MEET
254-145458-0001 INSISTING THAT SHE SHALL SHARE OUR DELIGHT IN THEM AND THERE ARE BOOKS EQUALLY DEAR TO US OF WHICH WE SAY NOTHING FEARING LEST THE PRAISE OF OTHERS
254-145458-0002 ALMOST AS SOON AS HE WAS DISCOVERABLE LET US SPARE A MOMENT AND A TEAR FOR THOSE GOLDEN DAYS IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS WHEN THERE WERE FIVE LEISURELY PAPERS OF AN EVENING
254-145458-0003 IN WHICH THE FREE LANCE MIGHT GRADUATE AND HE COULD SPEAK OF HIS ALMA MATER WHETHER THE GLOBE OR THE PALL MALL WITH AS MUCH PRIDE AS HE NEVER DOUBTED THE GLOBE OR THE PALL MALL WOULD SPEAK ONE DAY OF HIM
254-145458-0004 MYSELF BUT LATELY DOWN FROM SAINT JAMES I WAS NOT TOO PROUD TO TAKE SOME SLIGHT BUT PITYING INTEREST IN MEN OF OTHER COLLEGES THE UNUSUAL NAME OF A FRESHMAN UP AT WESTMINSTER ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION
254-145458-0005 LATER ONE HEARD THAT THIS UNDERGRADUATE FROM OVERSEAS HAD GONE UP AT AN AGE MORE ADVANCED THAN CUSTOMARY
254-145458-0006 SO ONE FELT THAT THIS WESTMINSTER FREE LANCE IN THE THIRTIES WAS NO FIT COMPETITOR FOR THE YOUTH OF OTHER COLLEGES INDEED IT COULD NOT COMPETE WELL I DISCOVERED HIM
254-145458-0007 WHICH MADE ME THUS UNGENEROUS OF HIS NAME OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE FEELING THAT THE OTHERS WERE NOT WORTHY OF HIM BUT HOW REFRESHING IT WAS WHEN SOME INTELLECTUALLY BLOWN UP STRANGER SAID DO YOU EVER READ SAKI
254-145458-0008 TO US MANY OTHERS WHO WERE TRYING TO DO IT TOO FOR WE WERE SO DOMESTIC HE SO TERRIFYINGLY COSMOPOLITAN WHILE WE WERE BEING FUNNY AS PLANNED WITH COLLAR STUDS AND HOT WATER BOTTLES
254-145458-0009 IF SAKI'S CARELESS CRUELTY THAT STRANGE BOYISH INSENSITIVENESS OF HIS DID NOT GIVE HIM AN UNFAIR START IN THE PURSUIT OF LAUGHTER IT MAY HAVE BEEN SO BUT FORTUNATELY
254-145458-0010 OUR EFFORTS TO BE FUNNY IN THE SAKI MANNER HAVE NOT SURVIVED TO PROVE IT WHAT IS SAKI'S MANNER
254-145458-0011 LIKE EVERY ARTIST WORTH CONSIDERATION HE HAD NO RECIPE IF HIS EXOTIC CHOICE OF SUBJECT WAS OFTEN HIS STRENGTH IT WAS OFTEN HIS WEAKNESS
254-145458-0012 IF HIS INSENSITIVENESS CARRIED HIM THROUGH AT TIMES TO VICTORY IT BROUGHT HIM AT TIMES TO DEFEAT I DO NOT THINK THAT HE HAS THAT MASTERY OF THE CONTE IN THIS BOOK AT LEAST
254-145458-0013 WHICH SOME HAVE CLAIMED FOR HIM
254-145458-0014 WHICH WAS NOT IN THE BOYISH SAKI'S EQUIPMENT HE LEAVES LOOSE ENDS EVERYWHERE NOR IN HIS DIALOGUE DELIGHTFUL AS IT OFTEN IS FUNNY AS IT NEARLY ALWAYS IS IS HE THE SUPREME MASTER
254-145458-0015 TOO MUCH DOES IT BECOME MONOLOGUE JUDICIOUSLY FED ONE CHARACTER GIVING AND THE OTHER TAKING BUT IN COMMENT IN REFERENCE IN DESCRIPTION IN EVERY DEVELOPMENT OF HIS STORY
254-145458-0016 HE HAS A CHOICE OF WORDS A WAY OF PUTTING THINGS WHICH IS AS INEVITABLY HIS OWN VINTAGE AS ONCE TASTED IT BECOMES THE PRIVATE VINTAGE OF THE CONNOISSEUR
254-145458-0017 LET US TAKE A SAMPLE OR TWO OF SAKI NINETEEN ELEVEN THE EARLIER STAGES OF THE DINNER HAD WORN OFF THE WINE LISTS HAD BEEN CONSULTED
254-145458-0018 LOCATE IS THE PLEASANT WORD HERE STILL MORE SATISFYING IN THE STORY OF THE MAN WHO WAS TATTOOED FROM COLLAR BONE TO WAIST LINE WITH A GLOWING REPRESENTATION OF THE FALL OF ICARUS
254-145458-0019 IS THE WORD PRIVILEGE THE DESIGN WHEN FINALLY DEVELOPED WAS A SLIGHT DISAPPOINTMENT TO MONSIEUR DEPLIS WHO HAD SUSPECTED ICARUS OF BEING A FORTRESS
254-145458-0020 BUT HE WAS MORE THAN SATISFIED WITH THE EXECUTION OF THE WORK WHICH WAS ACCLAIMED BY ALL WHO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SEEING IT AS PINCINI'S MASTERPIECE THIS STORY THE BACKGROUND
254-145458-0021 AND MISSUS PACKLETIDE'S TIGER SEEM TO ME TO BE THE MASTERPIECES OF THIS BOOK IN BOTH OF THEM CLOVIS EXERCISES NEEDLESSLY HIS TITULAR RIGHT OF ENTRY BUT HE CAN BE REMOVED WITHOUT DAMAGE
254-27760-0000 WHO HAD BEEN APPRENTICE TO THE SHOEMAKER ALIAKHIN FOR THREE MONTHS DID NOT GO TO BED THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS
254-27760-0001 HAD GONE OUT TO AN EARLY CHURCH SERVICE TO PROCURE FROM HIS EMPLOYER'S CUPBOARD
254-27760-0002 THEN SPREADING A CRUMPLED SHEET OF PAPER IN FRONT OF HIM HE BEGAN TO WRITE BEFORE HOWEVER DECIDING TO MAKE THE FIRST LETTER HE LOOKED FURTIVELY AT THE DOOR AND AT THE WINDOW GLANCED SEVERAL TIMES AT THE SOMBRE IKON
254-27760-0003 HE WROTE I AM WRITING YOU A LETTER
254-27760-0004 AND VIVIDLY PICTURED TO HIMSELF HIS GRANDFATHER
254-27760-0005 ALWAYS SMILING AND BLEAR EYED ALL DAY HE SLEPT IN THE SERVANTS KITCHEN OR TRIFLED WITH THE COOKS
254-27760-0006 HOW TO SNEAK UP AND TAKE A BITE AT A LEG OR SLIP INTO THE LARDER
254-27760-0007 MORE THAN ONCE THEY HAD NEARLY BROKEN HIS HIND LEGS TWICE HE HAD BEEN HUNG UP EVERY WEEK HE WAS NEARLY FLOGGED TO DEATH BUT HE ALWAYS RECOVERED AT THIS MOMENT FOR CERTAIN
254-27760-0008 HIS CUDGEL WILL BE HANGING FROM HIS BELT HE WILL BE HUGGING HIMSELF WITH COLD GIVING A LITTLE DRY OLD MAN'S COUGH AND AT TIMES PINCHING A SERVANT GIRL OR A COOK WON'T WE TAKE SOME SNUFF
254-27760-0009 HE ASKS HOLDING OUT HIS SNUFF BOX TO THE WOMEN THE WOMEN TAKE A PINCH OF SNUFF AND SNEEZE THE OLD MAN GOES INTO INDESCRIBABLE ECSTASIES BREAKS INTO LOUD LAUGHTER AND CRIES
254-27760-0010 NOT A BREATH OF WIND CLEAR AND FROSTY
254-27760-0011 THAT IT LOOKS AS IF IT HAD BEEN POLISHED AND RUBBED OVER WITH SNOW FOR THE HOLIDAYS VANKA SIGHS DIPS HIS PEN IN THE INK AND CONTINUES TO WRITE LAST NIGHT I GOT A THRASHING
254-27760-0012 MY MASTER DRAGGED ME BY MY HAIR INTO THE YARD AND BELABOURED ME WITH A SHOE MAKER'S STIRRUP BECAUSE

254-27760-0022 THE CHILDREN DON'T COME ROUND AT CHRISTMAS WITH A STAR NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO SING IN THE CHOIR
254-27760-0023 ALL FOR SALE AND FOR EVERY KIND OF FISH AWFULLY CONVENIENT AND THERE WAS ONE HOOK WHICH WOULD CATCH A SHEAT FISH WEIGHING A POUND AND THERE ARE SHOPS WITH GUNS LIKE THE MASTER'S AND I AM SURE THEY MUST COST ONE HUNDRED RUBLES EACH
254-27760-0024 TAKE A GOLDEN WALNUT AND HIDE IT IN MY GREEN BOX ASK THE YOUNG LADY OLGA IGNATYEVNA FOR IT SAY IT'S FOR VANKA VANKA SIGHED CONVULSIVELY AND AGAIN STARED AT THE WINDOW
254-27760-0025 HE REMEMBERED THAT HIS GRANDFATHER ALWAYS WENT TO THE FOREST FOR THE CHRISTMAS TREE AND TOOK HIS GRANDSON WITH HIM WHAT HAPPY TIMES THE FROST CRACKLED HIS GRANDFATHER CRACKLED AND AS THEY BOTH DID
254-27760-0026 VANKA DID THE SAME THEN BEFORE CUTTING DOWN THE CHRISTMAS TREE HIS GRANDFATHER SMOKED HIS PIPE TOOK A LONG PINCH OF SNUFF AND MADE FUN OF POOR FROZEN LITTLE VANKA
254-27760-0027 THE YOUNG FIR TREES WRAPT IN HOAR FROST STOOD MOTIONLESS WAITING FOR WHICH OF THEM WOULD DIE SUDDENLY A HARE SPRINGING FROM SOMEWHERE WOULD DART OVER THE SNOWDRIFT HIS GRANDFATHER COULD NOT HELP SHOUTING CATCH IT CATCH IT
254-27760-0028 SHORT TAILED DEVIL WHEN THE TREE WAS DOWN HIS GRANDFATHER DRAGGED IT TO THE MASTER'S HOUSE AND THERE THEY SET ABOUT DECORATING IT THE YOUNG LADY OLGA IGNATYEVNA VANKA'S GREAT FRIEND
254-27760-0029 BUSIED HERSELF MOST ABOUT IT WHEN LITTLE VANKA'S MOTHER PELAGUEYA WAS STILL ALIVE AND WAS SERVANT WOMAN IN THE HOUSE OLGA IGNATYEVNA USED TO STUFF HIM WITH SUGAR CANDY AND HAVING NOTHING TO DO
254-27760-0030 TAUGHT HIM TO READ WRITE COUNT UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND EVEN TO DANCE THE QUADRILLE WHEN PELAGUEYA DIED THEY PLACED THE ORPHAN VANKA IN THE KITCHEN WITH HIS GRANDFATHER AND FROM THE KITCHEN HE WAS SENT TO MOSCOW
254-27760-0031 AND I AM FRIGHTFULLY HUNGRY AND SO SAD THAT I CAN'T TELL YOU I CRY ALL THE TIME THE OTHER DAY THE MASTER HIT ME ON THE HEAD WITH A LAST I FELL TO THE GROUND AND ONLY JUST RETURNED TO LIFE

254-27760-0033 FROM WHOM HE HAD INQUIRED THE NIGHT BEFORE HAD TOLD HIM THAT LETTERS WERE TO BE PUT INTO POST BOXES AND FROM THERE THEY WERE CONVEYED OVER THE WHOLE EARTH IN MAIL TROIKAS BY DRUNKEN POST BOYS
254-27760-0034 AND TO THE SOUND OF BELLS VANKA RAN TO THE FIRST POST BOX AND SLIPPED HIS PRECIOUS LETTER INTO THE SLIT AN HOUR AFTERWARDS LULLED BY HOPE HE WAS SLEEPING SOUNDLY
26-495-0000 IN SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE WRITTEN BY A CITIZEN WHO CONTINUED ALL THE WHILE IN LONDON NEVER MADE PUBLIC BEFORE
26-495-0001 IT WAS ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR THAT I AMONG THE REST OF MY NEIGHBOURS HEARD IN ORDINARY DISCOURSE THAT THE PLAGUE WAS RETURNED AGAIN IN HOLLAND
26-495-0002 IT WAS BROUGHT SOME SAID FROM ITALY OTHERS FROM THE LEVANT AMONG SOME GOODS WHICH WERE BROUGHT HOME BY THEIR TURKEY FLEET OTHERS SAID IT WAS BROUGHT FROM CANDIA OTHERS FROM CYPRUS
26-495-0003 SPREAD RUMOURS AND REPORTS OF THINGS AND TO IMPROVE THEM BY THE INVENTION OF MEN AS I HAVE LIVED TO SEE PRACTISED SINCE
26-495-0004 AND FROM THEM WAS HANDED ABOUT BY WORD OF MOUTH ONLY SO THAT THINGS DID NOT SPREAD INSTANTLY OVER THE WHOLE NATION AS THEY DO NOW BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD A TRUE ACCOUNT OF IT
26-495-0005 AND SEVERAL COUNCILS WERE HELD ABOUT WAYS TO PREVENT ITS COMING OVER BUT ALL WAS KEPT VERY PRIVATE HENCE IT WAS THAT THIS RUMOUR DIED OFF AGAIN AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO FORGET IT AS A THING WE WERE VERY LITTLE CONCERNED IN
26-495-0006 AND THAT WE HOPED WAS NOT TRUE TILL THE LATTER END OF NOVEMBER OR THE BEGINNING OF DECEMBER SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR WHEN TWO MEN SAID TO BE FRENCHMEN DIED OF THE PLAGUE IN LONG ACRE
26-495-0007 OR RATHER AT THE UPPER END OF DRURY LANE
26-495-0008 ENDEAVOURED TO CONCEAL IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BUT AS IT HAD GOTTEN SOME VENT IN THE DISCOURSE OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THE SECRETARIES OF STATE GOT KNOWLEDGE OF IT AND CONCERNING THEMSELVES TO INQUIRE ABOUT IT IN ORDER TO BE CERTAIN OF THE TRUTH
26-495-0009 TWO PHYSICIANS AND A SURGEON WERE ORDERED TO GO TO THE HOUSE AND MAKE INSPECTION THIS THEY DID AND FINDING EVIDENT TOKENS OF THE SICKNESS UPON BOTH THE BODIES THAT WERE DEAD
26-495-0010 AND IT WAS PRINTED IN THE WEEKLY BILL OF MORTALITY IN THE USUAL MANNER THUS PLAGUE TWO PARISHES INFECTED ONE
26-495-0011 BUT AFTER THAT I THINK IT WAS ABOUT THE TWELFTH OF FEBRUARY ANOTHER DIED IN ANOTHER HOUSE BUT IN THE SAME PARISH AND IN THE SAME MANNER THIS TURNED THE PEOPLE'S EYES PRETTY MUCH TOWARDS THAT END OF THE TOWN
26-495-0012 IT BEGAN TO BE SUSPECTED THAT THE PLAGUE WAS AMONG THE PEOPLE AT THAT END OF THE TOWN AND THAT MANY HAD DIED OF IT THOUGH THEY HAD TAKEN CARE TO KEEP IT AS MUCH FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PUBLIC AS POSSIBLE
26-495-0013 THIS POSSESSED THE HEADS OF THE PEOPLE VERY MUCH AND FEW CARED TO GO THROUGH DRURY LANE OR THE OTHER STREETS SUSPECTED UNLESS THEY HAD EXTRAORDINARY BUSINESS THAT OBLIGED THEM TO IT
26-495-0014 THE USUAL NUMBER OF BURIALS IN A WEEK IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT GILES IN THE FIELDS AND SAINT ANDREW'S HOLBORN WERE FROM TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN OR NINETEEN EACH FEW MORE OR LESS
26-495-0015 IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE ORDINARY BURIALS INCREASED IN NUMBER CONSIDERABLY FOR EXAMPLE FROM DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH TO JANUARY THIRD
26-495-0016 THE LIKE INCREASE OF THE BILLS WAS OBSERVED IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT BRIDE'S ADJOINING ON ONE SIDE OF HOLBORN PARISH AND IN THE PARISH OF SAINT JAMES CLERKENWELL ADJOINING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HOLBORN
26-495-0017 SAINT BRIDE'S ZERO SAINT JAMES'S EIGHT
26-495-0018 SAINT BRIDE'S SIX SAINT JAMES'S NINE
26-495-0019 SAINT JAMES'S SEVEN
26-495-0020 SAINT BRIDE'S EIGHT
26-495-0021 SAINT JAMES'S SIX BESIDES THIS IT WAS OBSERVED WITH GREAT UNEASINESS BY THE PEOPLE THAT THE WEEKLY BILLS IN GENERAL INCREASED VERY MUCH DURING THESE WEEKS ALTHOUGH IT WAS AT A TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN
26-495-0022 IN ONE WEEK SINCE THE PRECEDING VISITATION OF SIXTEEN FIFTY SIX HOWEVER ALL THIS WENT OFF AGAIN AND THE WEATHER PROVING COLD AND THE FROST WHICH BEGAN IN DECEMBER
26-495-0023 STILL CONTINUING VERY SEVERE EVEN TILL NEAR THE END OF FEBRUARY ATTENDED WITH SHARP THOUGH MODERATE WINDS THE BILLS DECREASED AGAIN AND THE CITY GREW HEALTHY AND EVERYBODY BEGAN TO LOOK UPON THE DANGER AS GOOD AS OVER
26-495-0024 FROM THE BEGINNING OF APRIL ESPECIALLY THEY STOOD AT TWENTY FIVE EACH WEEK TILL THE WEEK FROM THE EIGHTEENTH TO THE TWENTY FIFTH
26-495-0025 THERE WAS NONE OF THE PLAGUE AND BUT FOUR OF THE SPOTTED FEVER BUT THE FOLLOWING WEEK IT RETURNED AGAIN AND THE DISTEMPER WAS SPREAD INTO TWO OR THREE OTHER PARISHES
26-495-0026 NOT KNOWING THAT HE WAS ALREADY INFECTED THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF MAY YET THE WEATHER WAS TEMPERATE VARIABLE AND COOL ENOUGH AND PEOPLE HAD STILL SOME HOPES THAT WHICH ENCOURAGED THEM WAS THAT THE CITY WAS HEALTHY
26-495-0027 THERE DIED BUT THREE OF WHICH NOT ONE WITHIN THE WHOLE CITY OR LIBERTIES AND SAINT ANDREW'S BURIED BUT FIFTEEN WHICH WAS VERY LOW
26-495-0028 BUT STILL AS THERE WAS BUT ONE OF THE PLAGUE PEOPLE BEGAN TO BE EASY THE WHOLE BILL ALSO WAS VERY LOW FOR THE WEEK BEFORE THE BILL WAS BUT THREE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN
26-495-0029 SO THAT NOW ALL OUR EXTENUATIONS ABATED AND IT WAS NO MORE TO BE CONCEALED NAY IT QUICKLY APPEARED THAT THE INFECTION HAD SPREAD ITSELF BEYOND ALL HOPES OF ABATEMENT THAT IN THE PARISH OF SAINT GILES
26-495-0030 BUT THIS WAS ALL KNAVERY AND COLLUSION
26-495-0031 YET THERE WAS FOURTEEN OF THE SPOTTED FEVER AS WELL AS FOURTEEN OF THE PLAGUE
26-495-0032 UPON THE WHOLE THAT THERE WERE FIFTY DIED THAT WEEK OF THE PLAGUE THE NEXT BILL WAS FROM THE TWENTY THIRD OF MAY TO THE THIRTIETH WHEN THE NUMBER OF THE PLAGUE WAS SEVENTEEN BUT
26-495-0033 A FRIGHTFUL NUMBER OF WHOM THEY SET DOWN BUT NINE OF THE PLAGUE BUT ON AN EXAMINATION MORE STRICTLY BY THE JUSTICES OF PEACE AND AT THE LORD MAYOR'S REQUEST
26-495-0034 TWENTY MORE WHO WERE REALLY DEAD OF THE PLAGUE IN THAT PARISH BUT HAD BEEN SET DOWN OF THE SPOTTED FEVER OR OTHER DISTEMPERS BESIDES OTHERS CONCEALED
26-495-0035 OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD CONTINUED VERY EASY BUT AT THE OTHER END OF THE TOWN THEIR CONSTERNATION WAS VERY GREAT AND THE RICHER SORT OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY FROM THE WEST PART OF THE CITY
26-495-0036 IN AN UNUSUAL MANNER AND THIS WAS MORE PARTICULARLY SEEN IN WHITECHAPPEL THAT IS TO SAY THE BROAD STREET WHERE I LIVED INDEED NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN BUT WAGGONS AND CARTS WITH GOODS
26-495-0037 COACHES FILLED WITH PEOPLE OF THE BETTER SORT AND HORSEMEN ATTENDING THEM AND ALL HURRYING AWAY THEN EMPTY WAGGONS AND CARTS APPEARED AND SPARE HORSES WITH SERVANTS WHO IT WAS APPARENT
26-495-0038 WERE RETURNING OR SENT FROM THE COUNTRIES TO FETCH MORE PEOPLE BESIDES INNUMERABLE NUMBERS OF MEN ON HORSEBACK SOME ALONE OTHERS WITH SERVANTS AND GENERALLY SPEAKING
26-495-0039 AS ANYONE MIGHT PERCEIVE BY THEIR APPEARANCE THIS WAS A VERY TERRIBLE AND MELANCHOLY THING TO SEE AND AS IT WAS A SIGHT WHICH I COULD NOT BUT LOOK ON FROM MORNING TO NIGHT
26-495-0040 THIS HURRY OF THE PEOPLE WAS SUCH FOR SOME WEEKS THAT THERE WAS NO GETTING AT THE LORD MAYOR'S DOOR WITHOUT EXCEEDING DIFFICULTY THERE WERE SUCH PRESSING AND CROWDING THERE
26-495-0041 TO GET PASSES AND CERTIFICATES OF HEALTH FOR SUCH AS TRAVELLED ABROAD FOR WITHOUT THESE THERE WAS NO BEING ADMITTED TO PASS THROUGH THE TOWNS UPON THE ROAD OR TO LODGE IN ANY INN
26-495-0042 NOW AS THERE HAD NONE DIED IN THE CITY FOR ALL THIS TIME MY LORD MAYOR GAVE CERTIFICATES OF HEALTH WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY TO ALL THOSE WHO LIVED IN THE NINETY SEVEN PARISHES AND TO THOSE WITHIN THE LIBERTIES TOO
26-495-0043 THIS HURRY I SAY CONTINUED SOME WEEKS THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE MONTH OF MAY AND JUNE AND THE MORE BECAUSE IT WAS RUMOURED THAT AN ORDER OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS TO BE ISSUED OUT
26-495-0044 TO PLACE TURNPIKES AND BARRIERS ON THE ROAD TO PREVENT PEOPLE TRAVELLING AND THAT THE TOWNS ON THE ROAD WOULD NOT SUFFER PEOPLE FROM LONDON TO PASS FOR FEAR OF BRINGING THE INFECTION ALONG WITH THEM
26-495-0045 CONCERNING MY OWN CASE AND HOW I SHOULD DISPOSE OF MYSELF THAT IS TO SAY WHETHER I SHOULD RESOLVE TO STAY IN LONDON OR SHUT UP MY HOUSE AND FLEE AS MANY OF MY NEIGHBOURS DID I HAVE SET THIS PARTICULAR DOWN
26-495-0046 SO FULLY BECAUSE I KNOW NOT BUT IT MAY BE OF MOMENT TO THOSE WHO COME AFTER ME IF THEY COME TO BE BROUGHT TO THE SAME DISTRESS AND TO THE SAME MANNER OF MAKING THEIR CHOICE AND THEREFORE
26-495-0047 TO NOTE WHAT BECAME OF ME I HAD TWO IMPORTANT THINGS BEFORE ME
26-495-0048 WHICH WAS CONSIDERABLE AND IN WHICH WAS EMBARKED ALL MY EFFECTS IN THE WORLD AND THE OTHER WAS THE PRESERVATION OF MY LIFE IN SO DISMAL A CALAMITY AS I SAW APPARENTLY WAS COMING UPON THE WHOLE CITY AND WHICH
26-495-0049 HOWEVER GREAT IT WAS MY FEARS PERHAPS AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE'S REPRESENTED TO BE MUCH GREATER THAN IT COULD BE
26-495-0050 MY TRADE WAS A SADDLER AND AS MY DEALINGS WERE CHIEFLY NOT BY A SHOP OR CHANCE TRADE BUT AMONG THE MERCHANTS TRADING TO THE ENGLISH COLONIES IN AMERICA SO MY EFFECTS LAY VERY MUCH IN THE HANDS OF SUCH
26-495-0051 BUT I HAD A FAMILY OF SERVANTS WHOM I KEPT AT MY BUSINESS HAD A HOUSE SHOP AND WAREHOUSES FILLED WITH GOODS AND IN SHORT TO LEAVE THEM ALL AS THINGS IN SUCH A CASE MUST BE LEFT THAT IS TO SAY
26-495-0052 WITHOUT ANY OVERSEER OR PERSON FIT TO BE TRUSTED WITH THEM HAD BEEN TO HAZARD THE LOSS NOT ONLY OF MY TRADE BUT OF MY GOODS AND INDEED OF ALL I HAD IN THE WORLD I HAD AN ELDER BROTHER
26-495-0053 AT THE SAME TIME IN LONDON AND NOT MANY YEARS BEFORE COME OVER FROM PORTUGAL AND ADVISING WITH HIM HIS ANSWER WAS IN THREE WORDS
26-495-0054 THAT THE BEST PREPARATION FOR THE PLAGUE WAS TO RUN AWAY FROM IT AS TO MY ARGUMENT OF LOSING MY TRADE MY GOODS OR DEBTS HE QUITE CONFUTED ME HE TOLD ME THE SAME THING WHICH
26-495-0055 FOR SAYS HE IS IT NOT AS REASONABLE THAT YOU SHOULD TRUST GOD WITH THE CHANCE OR RISK OF LOSING YOUR TRADE AS THAT YOU SHOULD STAY IN SO EMINENT A POINT OF DANGER AND TRUST HIM WITH YOUR LIFE I COULD NOT
26-495-0056 I SAY AS MANY DID BECAUSE SEVERAL DID SO AT LAST ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAD BEEN IN THE ARMIES IN THE WAR WHICH HAD NOT BEEN MANY YEARS PAST AND I MUST NEEDS SAY THAT SPEAKING OF SECOND CAUSES
26-495-0057 HAD MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT TRAVELLED DONE SO THE PLAGUE HAD NOT BEEN CARRIED INTO SO MANY COUNTRY TOWNS AND HOUSES AS IT WAS TO THE GREAT DAMAGE AND INDEED TO THE RUIN OF ABUNDANCE OF PEOPLE
26-495-0058 BUT THEN MY SERVANT WHOM I HAD INTENDED TO TAKE DOWN WITH ME DECEIVED ME AND BEING FRIGHTED AT THE INCREASE OF THE DISTEMPER AND NOT KNOWING WHEN I SHOULD GO HE TOOK OTHER MEASURES AND LEFT ME
26-495-0059 SO I WAS PUT OFF FOR THAT TIME AND ONE WAY OR OTHER I ALWAYS FOUND THAT TO APPOINT TO GO AWAY WAS ALWAYS CROSSED BY SOME ACCIDENT OR OTHER SO AS TO DISAPPOINT AND PUT IT OFF AGAIN
26-495-0060 ABOUT THESE DISAPPOINTMENTS BEING FROM HEAVEN I MENTION THIS STORY ALSO AS THE BEST METHOD I CAN ADVISE ANY PERSON TO TAKE IN SUCH A CASE ESPECIALLY IF HE BE ONE THAT MAKES CONSCIENCE OF HIS DUTY
26-495-0061 AND WOULD BE DIRECTED WHAT TO DO IN IT NAMELY THAT HE SHOULD KEEP HIS EYE UPON THE PARTICULAR PROVIDENCES WHICH OCCUR AT THAT TIME AND LOOK UPON THEM COMPLEXLY AS THEY REGARD ONE ANOTHER
26-495-0062 AND AS ALL TOGETHER REGARD THE QUESTION BEFORE HIM AND THEN I THINK HE MAY SAFELY TAKE THEM FOR INTIMATIONS FROM HEAVEN OF WHAT IS HIS UNQUESTIONED DUTY TO DO IN SUCH A CASE I MEAN
26-495-0063 SO THESE DISAPPOINTMENTS MUST HAVE SOMETHING IN THEM EXTRAORDINARY AND I OUGHT TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT DID NOT EVIDENTLY POINT OUT OR INTIMATE TO ME THAT IT WAS THE WILL OF HEAVEN I SHOULD NOT GO
26-495-0064 THAT WOULD SURROUND ME AND THAT IF I ATTEMPTED TO SECURE MYSELF BY FLEEING FROM MY HABITATION AND ACTED CONTRARY TO THESE INTIMATIONS WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE DIVINE IT WAS A KIND OF
26-495-0065 FLYING FROM GOD AND THAT HE COULD CAUSE HIS JUSTICE TO OVERTAKE ME WHEN AND WHERE HE THOUGHT FIT THESE THOUGHTS QUITE TURNED MY RESOLUTIONS AGAIN AND WHEN I CAME TO DISCOURSE WITH MY BROTHER AGAIN
26-495-0066 I TOLD HIM THAT I INCLINED TO STAY AND TAKE MY LOT IN THAT STATION IN WHICH GOD HAD PLACED ME AND THAT IT SEEMED TO BE MADE MORE ESPECIALLY MY DUTY ON THE ACCOUNT OF WHAT I HAVE SAID
26-495-0067 MY BROTHER THOUGH A VERY RELIGIOUS MAN HIMSELF LAUGHED AT ALL I HAD SUGGESTED ABOUT ITS BEING AN INTIMATION FROM HEAVEN AND TOLD ME SEVERAL STORIES OF SUCH FOOLHARDY PEOPLE AS HE CALLED THEM
26-495-0068 AS I WAS THAT I OUGHT INDEED TO SUBMIT TO IT AS A WORK OF HEAVEN IF I HAD BEEN ANY WAY DISABLED BY DISTEMPERS OR DISEASES AND THAT THEN NOT BEING ABLE TO GO
26-495-0069 I OUGHT TO ACQUIESCE IN THE DIRECTION OF HIM WHO HAVING BEEN MY MAKER HAD AN UNDISPUTED RIGHT OF SOVEREIGNTY IN DISPOSING OF ME AND THAT THEN THERE HAD BEEN
26-495-0070 ONLY BECAUSE I COULD NOT HIRE A HORSE TO GO OR MY FELLOW WAS RUN AWAY THAT WAS TO ATTEND ME WAS RIDICULOUS SINCE AT THE TIME I HAD MY HEALTH AND LIMBS AND OTHER SERVANTS AND MIGHT
26-495-0071 AND IN OTHER PLACES WHERE HE HAD BEEN FOR MY BROTHER BEING A MERCHANT WAS A FEW YEARS BEFORE AS I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED RETURNED FROM ABROAD COMING LAST FROM LISBON AND HOW
26-495-0072 THEY WOULD GO UNCONCERNED INTO INFECTED PLACES AND CONVERSE WITH INFECTED PERSONS BY WHICH MEANS THEY DIED AT THE RATE OF TEN OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND A WEEK
26-495-0073 WHEREAS THE EUROPEANS OR CHRISTIAN MERCHANTS WHO KEPT THEMSELVES RETIRED AND RESERVED GENERALLY ESCAPED THE CONTAGION UPON THESE ARGUMENTS MY BROTHER CHANGED MY RESOLUTIONS AGAIN
26-495-0074 AND I BEGAN TO RESOLVE TO GO AND ACCORDINGLY MADE ALL THINGS READY FOR IN SHORT THE INFECTION INCREASED ROUND ME
26-495-0075 AND AS I HAD ALREADY PREPARED EVERYTHING AS WELL AS I COULD AS TO MY BUSINESS AND WHOM TO ENTRUST MY AFFAIRS WITH I HAD LITTLE TO DO BUT TO RESOLVE I WENT HOME THAT EVENING GREATLY OPPRESSED IN MY MIND
26-495-0076 IRRESOLUTE AND NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO I HAD SET THE EVENING WHOLLY APART TO CONSIDER SERIOUSLY ABOUT IT AND WAS ALL ALONE FOR ALREADY PEOPLE HAD AS IT WERE BY A GENERAL CONSENT
26-495-0077 WHAT WAS MY DUTY TO DO AND I STATED THE ARGUMENTS WITH WHICH MY BROTHER HAD PRESSED ME TO GO INTO THE COUNTRY AND I SET AGAINST THEM THE STRONG IMPRESSIONS WHICH I HAD ON MY MIND FOR STAYING THE VISIBLE CALL I SEEMED TO HAVE
26-495-0078 FROM THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE OF MY CALLING AND THE CARE DUE FROM ME FOR THE PRESERVATION OF MY EFFECTS WHICH WERE AS I MIGHT SAY MY ESTATE ALSO THE INTIMATIONS WHICH I THOUGHT
26-495-0079 I OBEYED THIS LAY CLOSE TO ME AND MY MIND SEEMED MORE AND MORE ENCOURAGED TO STAY THAN EVER AND SUPPORTED WITH A SECRET SATISFACTION THAT I SHOULD BE KEPT ADD TO THIS THAT
26-495-0080 AND AT THAT JUNCTURE I HAPPENED TO STOP TURNING OVER THE BOOK
26-495-0081 I READ ON TO THE SEVENTH VERSE EXCLUSIVE AND AFTER THAT INCLUDED THE TENTH AS FOLLOWS I WILL SAY OF THE LORD HE IS MY REFUGE AND MY FORTRESS MY GOD
26-495-0082 IN HIM WILL I TRUST SURELY HE SHALL DELIVER THEE FROM THE SNARE OF THE FOWLER AND FROM THE NOISOME PESTILENCE HE SHALL COVER THEE WITH HIS FEATHERS AND UNDER HIS WINGS SHALT THOU TRUST
26-495-0083 BECAUSE THOU HAST MADE THE LORD WHICH IS MY REFUGE EVEN THE MOST HIGH THY HABITATION THERE SHALL NO EVIL BEFALL THEE NEITHER SHALL ANY PLAGUE COME NIGH THY DWELLING
26-495-0084 HE WAS AS ABLE TO KEEP ME IN A TIME OF THE INFECTION AS IN A TIME OF HEALTH AND IF HE DID NOT THINK FIT TO DELIVER ME STILL I WAS IN HIS HANDS
26-495-0085 AND IT WAS MEET HE SHOULD DO WITH ME AS SHOULD SEEM GOOD TO HIM WITH THIS RESOLUTION I WENT TO BED
26-495-0086 THE WOMAN BEING TAKEN ILL WITH WHOM I HAD INTENDED TO ENTRUST MY HOUSE AND ALL MY AFFAIRS
26-495-0087 AND AFTERWARDS FETCHED A ROUND FARTHER INTO BUCKINGHAMSHIRE OR BEDFORDSHIRE TO A RETREAT HE HAD FOUND OUT THERE FOR HIS FAMILY IT WAS A VERY ILL TIME TO BE SICK IN
26-495-0088 FOR IF ANY ONE COMPLAINED IT WAS IMMEDIATELY SAID HE HAD THE PLAGUE
26-495-0089 YET BEING VERY ILL BOTH IN MY HEAD AND IN MY STOMACH I WAS NOT WITHOUT APPREHENSION THAT I REALLY WAS INFECTED BUT IN ABOUT THREE DAYS I GREW BETTER THE THIRD NIGHT I RESTED WELL
26-495-0090 SWEATED A LITTLE AND WAS MUCH REFRESHED THE APPREHENSIONS OF ITS BEING THE INFECTION WENT ALSO QUITE AWAY WITH MY ILLNESS AND I WENT ABOUT MY BUSINESS AS USUAL
26-496-0000 IT WAS NOW MID JULY AND THE PLAGUE WHICH HAD CHIEFLY RAGED AT THE OTHER END OF THE TOWN AND AS I SAID BEFORE IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT GILES SAINT ANDREW'S HOLBORN
26-496-0001 FOR THE CITY THAT IS TO SAY WITHIN THE WALLS WAS INDIFFERENTLY HEALTHY STILL NOR WAS IT GOT THEN VERY MUCH OVER THE WATER INTO SOUTHWARK
26-496-0002 OF ALL DISTEMPERS WHEREOF IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED ABOVE SIX HUNDRED DIED OF THE PLAGUE YET THERE WAS BUT TWENTY EIGHT IN THE WHOLE CITY WITHIN THE WALLS AND BUT NINETEEN IN SOUTHWARK
26-496-0003 BUT WE PERCEIVED THE INFECTION KEPT CHIEFLY IN THE OUT PARISHES WHICH BEING VERY POPULOUS AND FULLER ALSO OF POOR THE DISTEMPER FOUND MORE TO PREY UPON THAN IN THE CITY
26-496-0004 YET THERE DIED NO MORE OF THE PLAGUE ON THE WHOLE SOUTHWARK SIDE OF THE WATER THAN SIXTEEN BUT THIS FACE OF THINGS SOON CHANGED
26-496-0005 AND IT BEGAN TO THICKEN IN CRIPPLEGATE PARISH ESPECIALLY AND IN CLARKENWELL SO THAT BY THE SECOND WEEK IN AUGUST CRIPPLEGATE PARISH ALONE BURIED EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX AND CLARKENWELL
26-496-0006 AND OF THE LAST THE BILL ITSELF SAID
26-496-0007 AND HAVING THE KEY IN MY POCKET I USED TO GO INTO THE HOUSE AND OVER MOST OF THE ROOMS TO SEE THAT ALL WAS WELL FOR THOUGH IT BE SOMETHING WONDERFUL TO TELL
26-496-0008 THAT ANY SHOULD HAVE HEARTS SO HARDENED IN THE MIDST OF SUCH A CALAMITY AS TO ROB AND STEAL YET CERTAIN IT IS THAT ALL SORTS OF VILLAINIES AND EVEN LEVITIES AND DEBAUCHERIES
26-496-0009 WERE THEN PRACTISED IN THE TOWN AS OPENLY AS EVER I WILL NOT SAY QUITE AS FREQUENTLY BECAUSE THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WERE MANY WAYS LESSENED BUT THE CITY ITSELF BEGAN NOW TO BE VISITED TOO
26-496-0010 MAGISTRATES AND SERVANTS LEFT IN THE CITY AS THEY FLED NOW OUT OF THE CITY SO I SHOULD OBSERVE THAT THE COURT REMOVED EARLY
26-496-0011 IN THE MONTH OF JUNE AND WENT TO OXFORD WHERE IT PLEASED GOD TO PRESERVE THEM AND THE DISTEMPER DID NOT AS I HEARD OF SO MUCH AS TOUCH THEM FOR WHICH I CANNOT SAY THAT
26-496-0012 AND HARDLY ANYTHING OF REFORMATION THOUGH THEY DID NOT WANT BEING TOLD THAT THEIR CRYING VICES MIGHT WITHOUT BREACH OF CHARITY BE SAID TO HAVE GONE FAR IN BRINGING THAT TERRIBLE JUDGEMENT UPON THE WHOLE NATION
26-496-0013 THAT IF I HAD BEEN A STRANGER AND AT A LOSS FOR MY WAY I MIGHT SOMETIMES HAVE GONE THE LENGTH OF A WHOLE STREET I MEAN OF THE BY STREETS AND SEEN NOBODY TO DIRECT ME
26-496-0014 BUT THEY WALKED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GREAT STREET NEITHER ON ONE SIDE
26-496-0015 BECAUSE AS I SUPPOSE THEY WOULD NOT MINGLE WITH ANYBODY THAT CAME OUT OF HOUSES OR
26-496-0016 AS OTHERS RETIRED REALLY FRIGHTED WITH THE DISTEMPER IT WAS A MERE DESOLATING OF SOME OF THE STREETS BUT THE FRIGHT WAS NOT YET NEAR SO GREAT IN THE CITY ABSTRACTLY SO CALLED
26-496-0017 AND PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THOUGH THEY WERE AT FIRST IN A MOST INEXPRESSIBLE CONSTERNATION YET AS I HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE DISTEMPER INTERMITTED OFTEN AT FIRST SO THEY WERE AS IT WERE
26-496-0018 A LITTLE HARDENED IT IS TRUE A VAST MANY PEOPLE FLED AS I HAVE OBSERVED YET THEY WERE CHIEFLY FROM THE WEST END OF THE TOWN AND FROM THAT WE CALL THE HEART OF THE CITY THAT IS TO SAY
26-496-0019 AMONG THE WEALTHIEST OF THE PEOPLE AND SUCH PEOPLE AS WERE UNENCUMBERED WITH TRADES AND BUSINESS BUT OF THE REST THE GENERALITY STAYED AND SEEMED TO ABIDE THE WORST SO THAT
26-496-0020 AND IN THE SUBURBS IN SOUTHWARK AND IN THE EAST PART SUCH AS WAPPING RATCLIFF STEPNEY ROTHERHITHE AND THE LIKE THE PEOPLE GENERALLY STAYED EXCEPT HERE AND THERE A FEW WEALTHY FAMILIES WHO AS ABOVE
26-496-0021 AND THE ROYAL FAMILY AND THE MONARCHY BEING RESTORED HAD FLOCKED TO LONDON TO SETTLE IN BUSINESS OR TO DEPEND UPON AND ATTEND THE COURT FOR REWARDS OF SERVICES PREFERMENTS AND THE LIKE
26-496-0022 WAS SUCH THAT THE TOWN WAS COMPUTED TO HAVE IN IT ABOVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE MORE THAN EVER IT HELD BEFORE NAY SOME TOOK UPON THEM TO SAY IT HAD TWICE AS MANY BECAUSE
26-496-0023 ALL THE RUINED FAMILIES OF THE ROYAL PARTY FLOCKED HITHER ALL THE OLD SOLDIERS SET UP TRADES HERE AND ABUNDANCE OF FAMILIES SETTLED HERE AGAIN
26-496-0024 TO LONDON I OFTEN THOUGHT THAT AS JERUSALEM WAS BESIEGED BY THE ROMANS WHEN THE JEWS WERE ASSEMBLED TOGETHER TO CELEBRATE THE PASSOVER BY WHICH MEANS AN INCREDIBLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED THERE
26-496-0025 AS THIS CONFLUX OF THE PEOPLE TO A YOUTHFUL AND GAY COURT MADE A GREAT TRADE IN THE CITY ESPECIALLY IN EVERYTHING THAT BELONGED TO FASHION AND FINERY
26-496-0026 MANUFACTURERS AND THE LIKE
27-123349-0000 SOME OF THE SCOTTISH EMIGRANTS HEATED WITH REPUBLICAN ENTHUSIASM AND UTTERLY DESTITUTE OF THE SKILL NECESSARY TO THE CONDUCT OF GREAT AFFAIRS EMPLOYED ALL THEIR INDUSTRY AND INGENUITY
27-123349-0001 BUT HE WAS PLACED UNDER THE CONTROL OF A COMMITTEE
27-123349-0002 WHERE THE EXPEDITION SHOULD LAND TO APPOINT OFFICERS TO SUPERINTEND THE LEVYING OF TROOPS TO DOLE OUT PROVISIONS AND AMMUNITION ALL THAT WAS LEFT TO THE GENERAL WAS TO DIRECT THE EVOLUTIONS OF THE ARMY IN THE FIELD
27-123349-0003 AND HE WAS FORCED TO PROMISE THAT EVEN IN THE FIELD EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF A SURPRISE HE WOULD DO NOTHING WITHOUT THE ASSENT OF A COUNCIL OF WAR MONMOUTH WAS TO COMMAND IN ENGLAND HIS SOFT MIND HAD AS USUAL
27-123349-0004 TAKEN AN IMPRESS FROM THE SOCIETY WHICH SURROUNDED HIM AMBITIOUS HOPES WHICH HAD SEEMED TO BE EXTINGUISHED REVIVED IN HIS BOSOM HE REMEMBERED THE AFFECTION WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN CONSTANTLY GREETED BY THE COMMON PEOPLE IN TOWN AND COUNTRY
27-123349-0005 AND EXPECTED THAT THEY WOULD NOW RISE BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS TO WELCOME HIM HE REMEMBERED THE GOOD WILL WHICH THE SOLDIERS HAD ALWAYS BORNE HIM AND FLATTERED HIMSELF THAT THEY WOULD COME OVER TO HIM BY REGIMENTS
27-123349-0006 ENCOURAGING MESSAGES REACHED HIM IN QUICK SUCCESSION FROM LONDON HE WAS ASSURED THAT THE VIOLENCE AND INJUSTICE WITH WHICH THE ELECTIONS HAD BEEN CARRIED ON HAD DRIVEN THE NATION MAD
27-123349-0007 THAT THE PRUDENCE OF THE LEADING WHIGS HAD WITH DIFFICULTY PREVENTED A SANGUINARY OUTBREAK ON THE DAY OF THE CORONATION AND THAT ALL THE GREAT LORDS WHO HAD SUPPORTED THE EXCLUSION BILL WERE IMPATIENT TO RALLY ROUND HIM
27-123349-0008 WILDMAN WHO LOVED TO TALK TREASON IN PARABLES SENT TO SAY THAT THE EARL OF RICHMOND JUST TWO HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE HAD LANDED IN ENGLAND WITH A HANDFUL OF MEN AND HAD A FEW DAYS LATER BEEN CROWNED ON THE FIELD OF BOSWORTH
27-123349-0009 ALL THAT WAS REQUIRED OF HIM WAS TO PROMISE THAT HE WOULD NOT ASSUME THE REGAL TITLE
27-123349-0010 IT WAS DETERMINED THAT TWO ENGLISHMEN
27-123349-0011 SHOULD ACCOMPANY ARGYLE TO SCOTLAND AND THAT FLETCHER SHOULD GO WITH MONMOUTH TO ENGLAND FLETCHER FROM THE BEGINNING HAD AUGURED ILL OF THE ENTERPRISE BUT HIS CHIVALROUS SPIRIT WOULD NOT SUFFER HIM TO DECLINE A RISK WHICH HIS FRIENDS SEEMED EAGER TO ENCOUNTER
27-123349-0012 WHEN GREY REPEATED WITH APPROBATION WHAT WILDMAN HAD SAID ABOUT RICHMOND AND RICHARD THE WELL READ AND THOUGHTFUL SCOT JUSTLY REMARKED THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY AND THE SEVENTEENTH
27-123349-0013 RICHMOND WAS ASSURED OF THE SUPPORT OF BARONS EACH OF WHOM COULD BRING AN ARMY OF FEUDAL RETAINERS INTO THE FIELD
27-123349-0014 A SUM SUFFICIENT FOR THE TWO EXPEDITIONS VERY LITTLE WAS OBTAINED FROM LONDON SIX THOUSAND POUNDS HAD BEEN EXPECTED THENCE BUT INSTEAD OF THE MONEY CAME EXCUSES FROM WILDMAN
27-123349-0015 BUT HIS INTELLECT AND HIS TEMPER PRESERVED HIM FROM THE VIOLENCE OF A PARTISAN HE HAD LIVED ON CONFIDENTIAL TERMS WITH SHAFTESBURY AND HAD THUS INCURRED THE DISPLEASURE OF THE COURT LOCKE'S PRUDENCE HAD HOWEVER
27-123349-0016 BEEN SUCH THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO LITTLE PURPOSE TO BRING HIM EVEN BEFORE THE CORRUPT AND PARTIAL TRIBUNALS OF THAT AGE IN ONE POINT HOWEVER HE WAS VULNERABLE HE WAS A STUDENT OF CHRIST CHURCH IN THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD
27-123349-0017 BUT THIS WAS NOT EASY LOCKE HAD AT OXFORD ABSTAINED FROM EXPRESSING ANY OPINION ON THE POLITICS OF THE DAY SPIES HAD BEEN SET ABOUT HIM DOCTORS OF DIVINITY AND MASTERS OF ARTS
27-123349-0018 TO THE EXCLUSION BILL AND TO THE CHARACTER OF THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY BUT IN VAIN LOCKE NEITHER BROKE OUT NOR DISSEMBLED BUT MAINTAINED SUCH STEADY SILENCE AND COMPOSURE AS FORCED THE TOOLS OF POWER TO OWN WITH VEXATION
27-123349-0019 THAT NEVER MAN WAS SO COMPLETE A MASTER OF HIS TONGUE AND OF HIS PASSIONS WHEN IT WAS FOUND THAT TREACHERY COULD DO NOTHING ARBITRARY POWER WAS USED AFTER VAINLY TRYING TO INVEIGLE LOCKE INTO A FAULT
27-123349-0020 THE GOVERNMENT RESOLVED TO PUNISH HIM WITHOUT ONE ORDERS CAME FROM WHITEHALL THAT HE SHOULD BE EJECTED AND THOSE ORDERS THE DEAN AND CANONS MADE HASTE TO OBEY
27-123349-0021 LOCKE WAS TRAVELLING ON THE CONTINENT FOR HIS HEALTH WHEN HE LEARNED THAT HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF HIS HOME AND OF HIS BREAD WITHOUT A TRIAL OR EVEN A NOTICE
27-123349-0022 THE INJUSTICE WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN TREATED WOULD HAVE EXCUSED HIM IF HE HAD RESORTED TO VIOLENT METHODS OF REDRESS BUT HE WAS NOT TO BE BLINDED BY PERSONAL RESENTMENT HE AUGURED NO GOOD FROM THE SCHEMES
27-123349-0023 BUT IT WAS APPREHENDED THAT ARGYLE WOULD SHORTLY APPEAR IN ARMS AMONG HIS CLANSMEN A PROCLAMATION WAS ACCORDINGLY ISSUED DIRECTING THAT SCOTLAND SHOULD BE PUT INTO A STATE OF DEFENCE THE MILITIA WAS ORDERED TO BE IN READINESS
27-123349-0024 ALL THE CLANS HOSTILE TO THE NAME OF CAMPBELL WERE SET IN MOTION JOHN MURRAY MARQUESS OF ATHOL
27-123349-0025 AND AT THE HEAD OF A GREAT BODY OF HIS FOLLOWERS
27-123349-0026 WHO HAD LONG RESIDED IN ENGLAND AS AMBASSADOR FROM THE UNITED PROVINCES AND EVERARD VAN DYKVELT WHO AFTER THE DEATH OF CHARLES HAD BEEN SENT BY THE STATE GENERAL ON A SPECIAL MISSION OF CONDOLENCE AND CONGRATULATION
27-123349-0027 THE KING SAID THAT HE HAD RECEIVED FROM UNQUESTIONABLE SOURCES INTELLIGENCE OF DESIGNS WHICH WERE FORMING AGAINST THE THRONE BY HIS BANISHED SUBJECTS IN HOLLAND SOME OF THE EXILES WERE CUTTHROATS
27-123349-0028 WHOM NOTHING BUT THE SPECIAL PROVIDENCE OF GOD HAD PREVENTED FROM COMMITTING A FOUL MURDER AND AMONG THEM WAS THE OWNER OF THE SPOT WHICH HAD BEEN FIXED FOR THE BUTCHERY
27-123349-0029 ARGYLE HAS THE GREATEST MEANS OF ANNOYING ME AND OF ALL PLACES HOLLAND IS THAT WHENCE A BLOW MAY BE BEST AIMED AGAINST ME THE DUTCH ENVOYS ASSURED HIS MAJESTY THAT WHAT HE HAD SAID SHOULD INSTANTLY BE COMMUNICATED TO THE GOVERNMENT
27-123349-0030 WERE AT THIS TIME MOST DESIROUS THAT THE HOSPITALITY OF THEIR COUNTRY
27-123349-0031 JAMES HAD LATELY HELD LANGUAGE WHICH ENCOURAGED THE HOPE THAT HE WOULD NOT PATIENTLY SUBMIT TO THE ASCENDANCY OF FRANCE IT SEEMED PROBABLE THAT HE WOULD CONSENT TO FORM A CLOSE ALLIANCE WITH THE UNITED PROVINCES AND THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA
27-123349-0032 THERE WAS THEREFORE AT THE HAGUE AN EXTREME ANXIETY TO AVOID ALL THAT COULD GIVE HIM OFFENCE THE PERSONAL INTEREST OF WILLIAM WAS ALSO ON THIS OCCASION IDENTICAL WITH THE INTEREST OF HIS FATHER IN LAW
27-123349-0033 BUT THE CASE WAS ONE WHICH REQUIRED RAPID AND VIGOROUS ACTION AND THE NATURE OF THE BATAVIAN INSTITUTIONS MADE SUCH ACTION ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THE UNION OF UTRECHT
27-123349-0034 FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEETING IMMEDIATE EXIGENCIES HAD NEVER BEEN DELIBERATELY REVISED AND PERFECTED IN A TIME OF TRANQUILLITY EVERY ONE OF THE SEVEN COMMONWEALTHS
27-123349-0035 WHICH THAT UNION HAD BOUND TOGETHER RETAINED ALMOST ALL THE RIGHTS OF SOVEREIGNTY AND ASSERTED THOSE RIGHTS PUNCTILIOUSLY AGAINST THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
27-123349-0036 AS THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAD NOT THE MEANS OF EXACTING PROMPT OBEDIENCE FROM THE PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES SO THE PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES HAD NOT THE MEANS OF EXACTING PROMPT OBEDIENCE FROM THE MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES
27-123349-0037 HOLLAND ALONE CONTAINED EIGHTEEN CITIES EACH OF WHICH WAS FOR MANY PURPOSES AN INDEPENDENT STATE JEALOUS OF ALL INTERFERENCE FROM WITHOUT IF THE RULERS OF SUCH A CITY RECEIVED FROM THE HAGUE AN ORDER
27-123349-0038 WHICH WAS UNPLEASING TO THEM THEY EITHER NEGLECTED IT ALTOGETHER OR EXECUTED IT LANGUIDLY AND TARDILY IN SOME TOWN COUNCILS INDEED THE INFLUENCE OF THE PRINCE OF ORANGE WAS ALL POWERFUL
27-123349-0039 BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PLACE WHERE THE BRITISH EXILES HAD CONGREGATED AND WHERE THEIR SHIPS HAD BEEN FITTED OUT WAS THE RICH AND POPULOUS AMSTERDAM AND THE MAGISTRATES OF AMSTERDAM WERE THE HEADS OF THE FACTION HOSTILE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
27-123349-0040 AND TO THE HOUSE OF NASSAU THE NAVAL ADMINISTRATION OF THE UNITED PROVINCES WAS CONDUCTED BY FIVE DISTINCT BOARDS OF ADMIRALTY ONE OF THOSE BOARDS SATE AT AMSTERDAM WAS PARTLY NOMINATED BY THE AUTHORITIES OF THAT CITY
27-123349-0041 AND SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY ANIMATED BY THEIR SPIRIT ALL THE ENDEAVOURS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO EFFECT WHAT JAMES DESIRED WERE FRUSTRATED BY THE EVASIONS OF THE FUNCTIONARIES OF AMSTERDAM AND BY THE BLUNDERS OF COLONEL BEVIL SKELTON
27-123349-0042 THEN INSTEAD OF APPLYING AS HE SHOULD HAVE DONE TO THE STATES GENERAL WHO SATE CLOSE TO HIS OWN DOOR
27-123349-0043 WITH A REQUEST THAT THE SUSPECTED SHIPS MIGHT BE DETAINED THE MAGISTRATES OF AMSTERDAM ANSWERED THAT THE ENTRANCE OF THE ZUYDER ZEE WAS OUT OF THEIR JURISDICTION AND REFERRED HIM TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT WAS NOTORIOUS THAT THIS WAS A MERE EXCUSE
27-123349-0044 AND THAT IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY REAL WISH AT THE STADTHOUSE OF AMSTERDAM TO PREVENT ARGYLE FROM SAILING NO DIFFICULTIES WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE SKELTON NOW ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE STATES GENERAL THEY SHOWED EVERY DISPOSITION TO COMPLY WITH HIS DEMAND
27-123349-0045 DEPARTED FROM THE COURSE WHICH THEY ORDINARILY OBSERVED IN THE TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS ON THE SAME DAY ON WHICH HE MADE HIS APPLICATION TO THEM AN ORDER DRAWN IN EXACT CONFORMITY WITH HIS REQUEST
27-123349-0046 WAS DESPATCHED TO THE ADMIRALTY OF AMSTERDAM BUT THIS ORDER IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME MISINFORMATION DID NOT CORRECTLY DESCRIBE THE SITUATION OF THE SHIPS THEY WERE SAID TO BE IN THE TEXEL
27-123349-0047 WOULD IN A MOMENT HAVE PUT AN END TO HIS EXPEDITION ROUND HIS LITTLE FLEET A BOAT WAS ROWING IN WHICH WERE SOME PERSONS WITH TELESCOPES WHOM HE SUSPECTED TO BE SPIES BUT NO EFFECTUAL STEP WAS TAKEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETAINING HIM
27-123349-0048 AND ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE SECOND OF MAY HE STOOD OUT TO SEA BEFORE A FAVOURABLE BREEZE THE VOYAGE WAS PROSPEROUS ON THE SIXTH THE ORKNEYS WERE IN SIGHT ARGYLE VERY UNWISELY ANCHORED OFF KIRKWALL
27-123349-0049 AND ALLOWED TWO OF HIS FOLLOWERS TO GO ON SHORE THERE THE BISHOP ORDERED THEM TO BE ARRESTED THE REFUGEES PROCEEDED TO HOLD A LONG AND ANIMATED DEBATE ON THIS MISADVENTURE
27-123349-0050 FOR FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF THEIR EXPEDITION HOWEVER LANGUID AND IRRESOLUTE THEIR CONDUCT MIGHT BE THEY NEVER IN DEBATE WANTED SPIRIT OR PERSEVERANCE SOME WERE FOR AN ATTACK ON KIRKWALL
27-123349-0051 SOME WERE FOR PROCEEDING WITHOUT DELAY TO ARGYLESHIRE AT LAST THE EARL SEIZED SOME GENTLEMEN WHO LIVED NEAR THE COAST OF THE ISLAND AND PROPOSED TO THE BISHOP AN EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS THE BISHOP RETURNED NO ANSWER AND THE FLEET
27-123349-0052 AFTER LOSING THREE DAYS SAILED AWAY THIS DELAY WAS FULL OF DANGER IT WAS SPEEDILY KNOWN AT EDINBURGH THAT THE REBEL SQUADRON HAD TOUCHED AT THE ORKNEYS TROOPS WERE INSTANTLY PUT IN MOTION
27-123349-0053 WHEN THE EARL REACHED HIS OWN PROVINCE HE FOUND THAT PREPARATIONS HAD BEEN MADE TO REPEL HIM AT DUNSTAFFNAGE HE SENT HIS SECOND SON CHARLES ON SHORE TO CALL THE CAMPBELLS TO ARMS BUT CHARLES RETURNED WITH GLOOMY TIDINGS
27-123349-0054 THE HERDSMEN AND FISHERMEN WERE INDEED READY TO RALLY ROUND MAC CALLUM MORE BUT OF THE HEADS OF THE CLAN SOME WERE IN CONFINEMENT AND OTHERS HAD FLED THOSE GENTLEMEN WHO REMAINED AT THEIR HOMES WERE EITHER WELL AFFECTED TO THE GOVERNMENT
27-123349-0055 OR AFRAID OF MOVING AND REFUSED EVEN TO SEE THE SON OF THEIR CHIEF FROM DUNSTAFFNAGE THE SMALL ARMAMENT PROCEEDED TO CAMPBELLTOWN NEAR THE SOUTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE PENINSULA OF KINTYRE
27-123349-0056 HERE THE EARL PUBLISHED A MANIFESTO DRAWN UP IN HOLLAND UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMITTEE BY JAMES STEWART A SCOTCH ADVOCATE WHOSE PEN WAS A FEW MONTHS LATER EMPLOYED IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY
27-123349-0057 IN THIS PAPER WERE SET FORTH WITH A STRENGTH OF LANGUAGE SOMETIMES APPROACHING TO SCURRILITY MANY REAL AND SOME IMAGINARY GRIEVANCES IT WAS HINTED THAT THE LATE KING HAD DIED BY POISON
27-123349-0058 A CHIEF OBJECT OF THE EXPEDITION WAS DECLARED TO BE THE ENTIRE SUPPRESSION
27-124992-0000 IS GENERALLY BELIEVED TO BE THE HIGH PRIEST ELIACHIM CALLED ALSO JOACHIM THE TRANSACTIONS HEREIN RELATED MOST PROBABLY HAPPENED IN HIS DAYS AND IN THE REIGN OF MANASSES AFTER HIS REPENTANCE AND RETURN FROM CAPTIVITY
27-124992-0001 IT TAKES ITS NAME FROM THAT ILLUSTRIOUS WOMAN BY WHOSE VIRTUE AND FORTITUDE AND ARMED WITH PRAYER THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WERE PRESERVED FROM THE DESTRUCTION THREATENED THEM BY HOLOFERNES AND HIS GREAT ARMY
27-124992-0002 SWORE BY HIS THRONE AND KINGDOM THAT HE WOULD REVENGE HIMSELF OF ALL THOSE COUNTRIES
27-124992-0003 THE TWO AND TWENTIETH DAY OF THE FIRST MONTH
27-124992-0004 AND ALL THE GOVERNORS AND HIS OFFICERS OF WAR
27-124992-0005 NABUCHODONOSOR THE KING CALLED HOLOFERNES
27-124992-0006 GO OUT AGAINST ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE WEST
27-124992-0007 CALLED THE CAPTAINS AND OFFICERS OF THE POWER OF THE ASSYRIANS AND HE MUSTERED MEN FOR THE EXPEDITION AND THE KING COMMANDED HIM A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND FIGHTING MEN ON FOOT AND TWELVE THOUSAND ARCHERS
27-124992-0008 WITH ALL PROVISIONS SUFFICIENT FOR THE ARMIES IN ABUNDANCE AND HERDS OF OXEN AND FLOCKS OF SHEEP
27-124992-0009 WITH THE CHARIOTS AND HORSEMEN AND ARCHERS
27-124992-0010 HE CAME TO THE GREAT MOUNTAINS OF ANGE
27-124992-0011 AND HE WENT UP TO ALL THEIR CASTLES
27-124992-0012 AND PILLAGED ALL THE CHILDREN OF THARSIS
27-124992-0013 WHO WERE OVER AGAINST THE FACE OF THE DESERT
27-124992-0014 AND HE FORCED ALL THE STATELY CITIES THAT WERE THERE FROM THE TORRENT OF MAMBRE
27-124992-0015 AND STRIPPED THEM OF ALL THEIR RICHES AND ALL THAT RESISTED HIM
27-124992-0016 AND HE SET ALL THE CORN ON FIRE
27-124992-0017 JUDITH CHAPTER THREE
27-124992-0018 HE DESTROYETH THEIR CITIES AND THEIR GODS
27-124992-0019 MESOPOTAMIA AND SYRIA SOBAL AND LIBYA
27-124992-0020 AND BE SUBJECT TO THEE THAN TO DIE AND TO PERISH
27-124992-0021 ALL MOUNTAINS AND HILLS AND FIELDS AND HERDS OF OXEN AND FLOCKS OF SHEEP AND GOATS AND HORSES AND CAMELS
27-124992-0022 AND MADE HIMSELF MASTER OF EVERY CITY
27-124992-0023 THAT THE INHABITANTS OF ALL THE CITIES BOTH PRINCES AND NOBLES AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE
27-124992-0024 THAT HE ONLY MIGHT BE CALLED GOD BY THOSE NATIONS WHICH COULD BE BROUGHT UNDER HIM
27-124992-0025 AND ALL APAMEA AND ALL MESOPOTAMIA
27-124992-0026 AND STAYED THERE FOR THIRTY DAYS
27-124992-0027 JUDITH CHAPTER FOUR
27-124992-0028 LEST HE SHOULD DO THE SAME TO JERUSALEM AND TO THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD
27-124992-0029 WROTE TO ALL THAT WERE OVER AGAINST ESDRELON
27-124992-0030 AND TO ALL BY WHOM THERE MIGHT BE A PASSAGE OF WAY THAT THEY SHOULD TAKE POSSESSION OF THE ASCENTS OF THE MOUNTAINS BY WHICH THERE MIGHT BE ANY WAY TO JERUSALEM
27-124992-0031 AND THEY HUMBLED THEIR SOULS IN FASTINGS AND PRAYERS
27-124992-0032 AND THEY CAUSED THE LITTLE CHILDREN TO LIE PROSTRATE BEFORE THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD
27-124992-0033 THAT THEIR CHILDREN MIGHT NOT BE MADE A PREY AND THEIR WIVES CARRIED OFF AND THEIR CITIES DESTROYED AND THEIR HOLY THINGS PROFANED
27-124992-0034 KNOW YE THAT THE LORD WILL HEAR YOUR PRAYERS
27-124992-0035 THAT TRUSTED IN HIS OWN STRENGTH AND IN HIS POWER AND IN HIS ARMY AND IN HIS SHIELDS AND IN HIS CHARIOTS AND IN HIS HORSEMEN NOT BY FIGHTING WITH THE SWORD
27-124992-0036 JUDITH CHAPTER FIVE

27-124992-0039 HAVE DESPISED US AND HAVE NOT COME OUT TO MEET US
27-124992-0040 ANSWERING SAID IF THOU VOUCHSAFE MY LORD TO HEAR I WILL TELL THE TRUTH IN THY SIGHT CONCERNING THIS PEOPLE THAT DWELLETH IN THE MOUNTAINS
27-124992-0041 WHO ALSO COMMANDED THEM TO DEPART FROM THENCE AND TO DWELL IN CHARAN AND WHEN THERE WAS A FAMINE OVER ALL THE LAND THEY WENT DOWN INTO EGYPT AND THERE FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS WERE SO MULTIPLIED
27-124992-0042 AND MADE SLAVES OF THEM TO LABOUR IN CLAY AND BRICK IN THE BUILDING OF HIS CITIES THEY CRIED TO THEIR LORD AND HE STRUCK THE WHOLE LAND OF EGYPT
27-124992-0043 AND THE PLAGUE HAD CEASED FROM THEM AND THEY HAD A MIND TO TAKE THEM AGAIN
27-124992-0044 SO THAT THE WATERS WERE MADE TO STAND FIRM AS A WALL ON EITHER SIDE
27-124992-0045 THEY WERE SO OVERWHELMED WITH THE WATERS
27-124992-0046 IN WHICH NEVER MAN COULD DWELL
27-124992-0047 AND OF THE HETHITES AND OF THE HEVITES AND OF THE AMORRHITES AND ALL THE MIGHTY ONES IN HESEBON

27-124992-0052 WHEN ACHIOR HAD CEASED TO SPEAK THESE WORDS ALL THE GREAT MEN OF HOLOFERNES WERE ANGRY
27-124992-0053 AND HIS ARMIES MEN UNARMED AND WITHOUT FORCE
27-124992-0054 LET US GO UP INTO THE MOUNTAINS AND WHEN THE BRAVEST OF THEM SHALL BE TAKEN
27-124992-0055 AND BESIDES HIM THERE IS NO OTHER JUDITH CHAPTER SIX
27-124992-0056 WHEN THEY HAD LEFT OFF SPEAKING THAT HOLOFERNES BEING IN A VIOLENT PASSION
27-124992-0057 THAT THE NATION OF ISRAEL IS DEFENDED BY THEIR GOD
27-124992-0058 THEN THOU ALSO SHALT DIE WITH THEM BY THE SWORD OF THE ASSYRIANS
27-124992-0059 AND THEN THE SWORD OF MY SOLDIERS SHALL PASS THROUGH THY SIDES AND THOU SHALT BE STABBED AND FALL AMONG THE WOUNDED OF ISRAEL

27-124992-0062 AND TO LEAD HIM TO BETHULIA
27-124992-0063 WENT THROUGH THE PLAINS BUT WHEN THEY CAME NEAR THE MOUNTAINS
27-124992-0064 AND SO LEFT HIM BOUND WITH ROPES
27-124992-0065 AND SETTING HIM IN THE MIDST OF THE PEOPLE ASKED HIM
27-124992-0066 AND IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL THE PEOPLE ALL THAT HE HAD SAID BEING ASKED BY HOLOFERNES
27-124992-0067 HAD COMMANDED HIM TO BE DELIVERED FOR THIS CAUSE TO THE ISRAELITES THAT WHEN HE SHOULD OVERCOME THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL THEN HE MIGHT COMMAND ACHIOR ALSO HIMSELF TO BE PUT TO DEATH BY DIVERSE TORMENTS FOR HAVING SAID
27-124992-0068 ALL THE PEOPLE FELL UPON THEIR FACES ADORING THE LORD AND ALL OF THEM TOGETHER MOURNING AND WEEPING
27-124992-0069 O LORD GOD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH BEHOLD THEIR PRIDE AND LOOK ON OUR LOW CONDITION AND HAVE REGARD TO THE FACE OF THY SAINTS AND SHEW THAT THOU FORSAKEST NOT THEM THAT TRUST ON THEE
27-124992-0070 THE GOD OF OUR FATHERS WHOSE POWER THOU HAST SET FORTH WILL MAKE THIS RETURN TO THEE
27-124992-0071 LET GOD BE WITH THEE ALSO IN THE MIDST OF US THAT AS IT SHALL PLEASE THEE SO THOU WITH ALL THINE
27-124992-0072 AFTER THE ASSEMBLY WAS BROKEN UP RECEIVED HIM INTO HIS HOUSE
27-124992-0073 AND THEY REFRESHED THEMSELVES TOGETHER
27-124992-0074 AND THEY PRAYED ALL THE NIGHT LONG WITHIN THE CHURCH DESIRING HELP OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL
27-124992-0075 THE CHURCH THAT IS THE SYNAGOGUE OR PLACE WHERE THEY MET FOR PRAYER JUDITH CHAPTER SEVEN HOLOFERNES BESIEGETH BETHULIA
27-124992-0076 AND TWO AND TWENTY THOUSAND HORSEMEN BESIDES THE PREPARATIONS OF THOSE MEN WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN

27-124992-0078 WHEN THEY SAW THE MULTITUDE OF THEM PROSTRATED THEMSELVES UPON THE GROUND
2817-142371-0000 THE NEXT SATURDAY EVENING THERE WAS MUCH EXCITED DISCUSSION AT THE DONNITHORNE ARMS CONCERNING AN INCIDENT WHICH HAD OCCURRED THAT VERY DAY NO LESS THAN A SECOND APPEARANCE OF THE SMART MAN IN TOP BOOTS
2817-142371-0001 THE PERSONAL WITNESS TO THE STRANGER'S VISIT PRONOUNCED CONTEMPTUOUSLY TO BE NOTHING BETTER THAN A BAILIFF SUCH AS SATCHELL HAD BEEN BEFORE HIM NO ONE HAD THOUGHT OF DENYING MISTER CASSON'S TESTIMONY TO THE FACT THAT HE HAD SEEN THE STRANGER NEVERTHELESS

2817-142371-0032 AND NOW POYSER AS SATCHELL IS LAID UP I AM INTENDING TO LET THE CHASE FARM TO A RESPECTABLE TENANT I'M TIRED OF HAVING A FARM ON MY OWN HANDS NOTHING IS MADE THE BEST OF IN SUCH CASES AS YOU KNOW
2817-142371-0033 SAID MISTER POYSER WITH A GOOD NATURED BLANKNESS OF IMAGINATION AS TO THE NATURE OF THE ARRANGEMENT IF I'M CALLED UPON TO SPEAK SIR SAID MISSUS POYSER AFTER GLANCING AT HER HUSBAND WITH PITY AT HIS SOFTNESS YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ME
2817-142371-0034 NOT BUT WHAT I'M GLAD TO HEAR O ANYBODY RESPECTABLE COMING INTO THE PARISH THERE'S SOME
2817-142371-0035 YOU'RE LIKELY TO FIND MISTER THURLE AN EXCELLENT NEIGHBOUR I ASSURE YOU SUCH A ONE AS YOU WILL FEEL GLAD TO HAVE ACCOMMODATED BY THE LITTLE PLAN I'M GOING TO MENTION ESPECIALLY AS I HOPE YOU WILL FIND IT AS MUCH TO YOUR OWN ADVANTAGE AS HIS
2817-142371-0036 INDEED SIR IF IT'S ANYTHING T OUR ADVANTAGE
2817-142371-0037 I THINK FOLKS HAVE TO WAIT LONG ENOUGH AFORE IT'S BROUGHT TO EM THE FACT IS POYSER SAID THE SQUIRE IGNORING MISSUS POYSER'S THEORY OF WORLDLY PROSPERITY
2817-142371-0038 NOW THE PLAN I'M THINKING OF IS TO EFFECT A LITTLE EXCHANGE IF YOU WERE TO HAVE THE HOLLOW PASTURES YOU MIGHT INCREASE YOUR DAIRY WHICH MUST BE SO PROFITABLE UNDER YOUR WIFE'S MANAGEMENT AND I SHOULD REQUEST YOU MISSUS POYSER
2817-142371-0039 THAN CORN LAND MISTER POYSER WAS LEANING FORWARD WITH HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND HIS MOUTH SCREWED UP
2817-142371-0040 HE WAS MUCH TOO ACUTE A MAN NOT TO SEE THROUGH THE WHOLE BUSINESS AND TO FORESEE PERFECTLY WHAT WOULD BE HIS WIFE'S VIEW OF THE SUBJECT BUT HE DISLIKED GIVING UNPLEASANT ANSWERS UNLESS IT WAS ON A POINT OF FARMING PRACTICE
2817-142371-0041 HE WOULD RATHER GIVE UP THAN HAVE A QUARREL ANY DAY AND AFTER ALL IT MATTERED MORE TO HIS WIFE THAN TO HIM SO AFTER A FEW MOMENTS SILENCE HE LOOKED UP AT HER AND SAID MILDLY WHAT DOST SAY
2817-142371-0042 MISSUS POYSER HAD HAD HER EYES FIXED ON HER HUSBAND WITH COLD SEVERITY DURING HIS SILENCE BUT NOW SHE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD WITH A TOSS LOOKED ICILY AT THE OPPOSITE ROOF OF THE COW SHED AND SPEARING HER KNITTING TOGETHER WITH THE LOOSE PIN
2817-142371-0043 HELD IT FIRMLY BETWEEN HER CLASPED HANDS SAY WHY I SAY YOU MAY DO AS YOU LIKE
2817-142371-0044 I KNOW THERE'S THEM AS IS BORN T OWN THE LAND AND THEM AS IS BORN TO SWEAT ON'T HERE MISSUS POYSER PAUSED TO GASP A LITTLE AND I KNOW IT'S CHRISTENED FOLKS'S DUTY TO SUBMIT TO THEIR BETTERS AS FUR AS FLESH AND

2817-142371-0046 NO NO MY DEAR MISSUS POYSER CERTAINLY NOT SAID THE SQUIRE STILL CONFIDENT IN HIS OWN POWERS OF PERSUASION YOU MUST NOT OVERWORK YOURSELF
2817-142371-0047 BUT DON'T YOU THINK YOUR WORK WILL RATHER BE LESSENED THAN INCREASED IN THIS WAY THERE IS SO MUCH MILK REQUIRED AT THE ABBEY THAT YOU WILL HAVE LITTLE INCREASE OF CHEESE AND BUTTER MAKING FROM THE ADDITION TO YOUR DAIRY
2817-142371-0048 THAT IT WAS NOT IN THIS CASE A PURELY ABSTRACT QUESTION I DARESAY SAID MISSUS POYSER BITTERLY TURNING HER HEAD HALF WAY TOWARDS HER HUSBAND AND LOOKING AT THE VACANT ARM CHAIR I DARESAY IT'S TRUE FOR MEN
2817-142371-0049 WI INS AN OUTS TO FIT INT EVERYTHING ELSE IF YOU COULD MAKE A PUDDING WI THINKING O THE BATTER IT UD BE EASY GETTING DINNER
2817-142371-0050 WHAT'S TO MAKE ME SURE AS THE HOUSE WON'T BE PUT O BOARD WAGE AFORE WE'RE MANY MONTHS OLDER AND THEN

2817-142371-0053 THAT DIFFICULTY ABOUT THE FETCHING AND CARRYING YOU WILL NOT HAVE MISSUS POYSER SAID THE SQUIRE WHO THOUGHT THAT THIS ENTRANCE INTO PARTICULARS INDICATED A DISTANT INCLINATION TO COMPROMISE ON MISSUS POYSER'S PART
2817-142371-0054 BETHELL WILL DO THAT REGULARLY WITH THE CART AND PONY OH SIR BEGGING YOUR PARDON I'VE NEVER BEEN USED T HAVING GENTLEFOLKS'S SERVANTS COMING ABOUT MY BACK PLACES A MAKING LOVE TO BOTH THE GELLS AT ONCE
2817-142371-0055 AND KEEPING EM WITH THEIR HANDS ON THEIR HIPS LISTENING TO ALL MANNER O GOSSIP WHEN THEY SHOULD BE DOWN ON THEIR KNEES A SCOURING IF WE'RE TO GO TO RUIN IT SHANNA BE WI HAVING OUR BACK KITCHEN TURNED INTO A PUBLIC WELL POYSER
2817-142371-0056 AND I SHALL NOT FORGET YOUR READINESS TO ACCOMMODATE YOUR LANDLORD AS WELL AS A NEIGHBOUR I KNOW YOU WILL BE GLAD TO HAVE YOUR LEASE RENEWED FOR THREE YEARS WHEN THE PRESENT ONE EXPIRES OTHERWISE I DARESAY THURLE WHO IS A MAN OF SOME CAPITAL
2817-142371-0057 EVEN WITHOUT THE FINAL THREAT HER HUSBAND REALLY ALARMED AT THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR LEAVING THE OLD PLACE WHERE HE HAD BEEN BRED AND BORN FOR HE BELIEVED THE OLD SQUIRE HAD SMALL SPITE ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING
2817-142371-0058 WAS BEGINNING A MILD REMONSTRANCE EXPLANATORY OF THE INCONVENIENCE HE SHOULD FIND IN HAVING TO BUY AND SELL MORE STOCK WITH
2817-142371-0059 WHEN MISSUS POYSER BURST IN WITH THE DESPERATE DETERMINATION TO HAVE HER SAY OUT THIS ONCE THOUGH IT WERE TO RAIN NOTICES TO QUIT AND THE ONLY SHELTER WERE THE WORK HOUSE THEN SIR IF I MAY SPEAK AS
2817-142371-0060 SIGN HER SOUL AWAY I'VE A RIGHT TO SPEAK FOR I MAKE ONE QUARTER O THE RENT AND SAVE ANOTHER QUARTER
2817-142371-0061 WI THE CELLAR FULL O WATER AND FROGS AND TOADS HOPPIN UP THE STEPS BY DOZENS AND THE FLOORS ROTTEN AND THE RATS AND MICE GNAWING EVERY BIT O CHEESE AND RUNNIN OVER OUR HEADS AS WE LIE BED TILL WE EXPECT EM TO EAT US UP ALIVE
2817-142371-0062 AS IT'S A MERCY THEY HANNA EAT THE CHILDREN LONG AGO
2817-142371-0063 TILL A PLACE TUMBLES DOWN AND NOT THEN ON'Y WI BEGGING AND PRAYING AND HAVING TO PAY HALF AND BEING STRUNG UP WI THE RENT AS IT'S MUCH IF HE GETS ENOUGH OUT O THE LAND TO PAY FOR ALL HE'S PUT HIS OWN MONEY INTO THE GROUND BEFOREHAND SEE
2817-142371-0064 IF YOU'LL GET A STRANGER TO LEAD SUCH A LIFE HERE AS THAT A MAGGOT MUST BE BORN THE ROTTEN CHEESE TO LIKE IT I RECKON YOU MAY RUN AWAY FROM MY WORDS SIR CONTINUED MISSUS POYSER FOLLOWING THE OLD SQUIRE BEYOND THE DOOR
2817-142371-0065 FOR AFTER THE FIRST MOMENTS OF STUNNED SURPRISE HE HAD GOT UP AND WAVING HIS HAND TOWARDS HER WITH A SMILE HAD WALKED OUT TOWARDS HIS PONY BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO GET AWAY IMMEDIATELY FOR JOHN WAS WALKING THE PONY UP AND DOWN THE YARD
2817-142371-0066 AND WAS SOME DISTANCE FROM THE CAUSEWAY WHEN HIS MASTER BECKONED YOU MAY RUN AWAY FROM MY WORDS SIR AND YOU MAY GO SPINNIN UNDERHAND WAYS O DOING US A MISCHIEF FOR YOU'VE GOT OLD HARRY TO YOUR FRIEND THOUGH NOBODY ELSE IS
2817-142371-0067 FOR WANT O KNOWING HOW T UNDO THE TACKLE
2817-142371-0068 AS SPEAKS MY MIND THERE'S PLENTY O THE SAME WAY O THINKING THIS PARISH
2817-142371-0069 FOR YOUR NAME'S NO BETTER THAN A BRIMSTONE MATCH IN EVERYBODY'S NOSE IF IT ISNA TWO THREE OLD FOLKS AS YOU THINK O SAVING YOUR SOUL BY GIVING EM A BIT O FLANNEL AND A DROP O PORRIDGE AN YOU MAY BE RIGHT THINKING IT'LL TAKE BUT LITTLE TO SAVE YOUR SOUL
2817-142371-0070 THERE ARE OCCASIONS ON WHICH TWO SERVANT GIRLS AND A WAGGONER MAY BE A FORMIDABLE AUDIENCE AND AS THE SQUIRE RODE AWAY ON HIS BLACK PONY EVEN THE GIFT OF SHORT SIGHTEDNESS DID NOT PREVENT HIM FROM BEING AWARE THAT MOLLY
2817-142371-0071 AND THE GANDER HISSING AT A SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE PONY'S HEELS CARRIED OUT THE IDEA OF MISSUS POYSER'S SOLO IN AN IMPRESSIVE QUARTET MISSUS POYSER HOWEVER HAD NO SOONER SEEN THE PONY MOVE OFF THAN SHE TURNED ROUND
2817-142371-0072 GAVE THE TWO HILARIOUS DAMSELS A LOOK WHICH DROVE THEM INTO THE BACK KITCHEN AND UNSPEARING HER KNITTING BEGAN TO KNIT AGAIN WITH HER USUAL RAPIDITY AS SHE RE ENTERED THE HOUSE THEE'ST DONE IT NOW SAID MISTER POYSER
2817-142371-0073 A LITTLE ALARMED AND UNEASY BUT NOT WITHOUT SOME TRIUMPHANT AMUSEMENT AT HIS WIFE'S OUTBREAK YES I KNOW I'VE DONE IT SAID MISSUS POYSER
2817-142371-0074 THERE'S NO PLEASURE LIVING IF YOU'RE TO BE CORKED UP FOR EVER AND ONLY DRIBBLE YOUR MIND OUT BY THE SLY LIKE A LEAKY BARREL I SHAN'T REPENT SAYING WHAT I THINK
2817-142371-0075 AND THERE'S LITTLE LIKELIHOOD FOR IT SEEMS AS IF THEM AS AREN'T WANTED HERE ARE TH
2817-142371-0076 THIS MICHAELMAS TWELVEMONTH SAID MISTER POYSER AND GOING INTO A STRANGE PARISH WHERE THEE KNOW'ST NOBODY IT'LL BE HARD UPON US BOTH
2817-142371-0077 THERE'S PLENTY O THINGS MAY HAPPEN BETWEEN THIS AND MICHAELMAS TWELVEMONTH THE CAPTAIN MAY BE MASTER AFORE THEM FOR WHAT WE KNOW SAID MISSUS POYSER INCLINED TO TAKE AN UNUSUALLY HOPEFUL VIEW OF AN EMBARRASSMENT WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY HER OWN MERIT
2817-142371-0078 AND NOT BY OTHER PEOPLE'S FAULT I'M NONE FOR WORRETING SAID MISTER POYSER RISING FROM HIS THREE CORNERED CHAIR AND WALKING SLOWLY TOWARDS THE DOOR
2817-142380-0000 WITH TWO BEDS IN IT ONE LAID ON THE FLOOR IT IS TEN O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND THE DARK WALL OPPOSITE THE WINDOW SHUTS OUT THE MOONLIGHT THAT MIGHT HAVE STRUGGLED WITH THE LIGHT OF THE ONE DIP CANDLE BY WHICH BARTLE MASSEY IS PRETENDING TO READ
2817-142380-0001 THE NEGLECTED BEARD OF A MAN JUST RISEN FROM A SICK BED HIS HEAVY BLACK HAIR HANGS OVER HIS FOREHEAD AND THERE IS NO ACTIVE IMPULSE IN HIM WHICH INCLINES HIM TO PUSH IT OFF THAT HE MAY BE MORE AWAKE TO WHAT IS AROUND HIM
2817-142380-0002 HE HAS ONE ARM OVER THE BACK OF THE CHAIR AND HE SEEMS TO BE LOOKING DOWN AT HIS CLASPED HANDS HE IS ROUSED BY A KNOCK AT THE DOOR
2817-142380-0003 SAID BARTLE MASSEY RISING HASTILY AND UNFASTENING THE DOOR IT WAS MISTER IRWINE ADAM ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR WITH INSTINCTIVE RESPECT AS MISTER IRWINE APPROACHED HIM AND TOOK HIS HAND I'M LATE ADAM
2817-142380-0004 LET US ALL SIT DOWN ADAM TOOK HIS CHAIR AGAIN MECHANICALLY AND BARTLE FOR WHOM THERE WAS NO CHAIR REMAINING SAT ON THE BED IN THE BACKGROUND HAVE YOU SEEN HER SIR
2817-142380-0005 YES ADAM I AND THE CHAPLAIN HAVE BOTH BEEN WITH HER THIS EVENING DID YOU ASK HER SIR DID YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ME YES SAID MISTER IRWINE WITH SOME HESITATION
2817-142380-0006 IT IS NOT ONLY YOU SOME FATAL INFLUENCE SEEMS TO HAVE SHUT UP HER HEART AGAINST HER FELLOW CREATURES SHE HAS SCARCELY SAID ANYTHING MORE THAN NO EITHER TO ME OR THE CHAPLAIN THREE OR FOUR DAYS AGO BEFORE YOU WERE MENTIONED TO HER
2817-142380-0007 WHEN I ASKED HER IF THERE WAS ANY ONE OF HER FAMILY WHOM SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE TO WHOM SHE COULD OPEN HER MIND SHE SAID WITH A VIOLENT SHUDDER TELL THEM NOT TO COME NEAR ME I WON'T SEE ANY OF THEM
2817-142380-0008 IF THEY NOW URGE YOU STRONGLY TO GO AND SEE HER TO MORROW MORNING EVEN WITHOUT HER CONSENT
2817-142380-0009 THAT THE INTERVIEW MIGHT AFFECT HER FAVOURABLY BUT I GRIEVE TO SAY I HAVE SCARCELY ANY HOPE OF THAT SHE DIDN'T SEEM AGITATED WHEN I MENTIONED YOUR NAME SHE ONLY SAID NO IN THE SAME COLD OBSTINATE WAY AS USUAL
2817-142380-0010 AND IF THE MEETING HAD NO GOOD EFFECT ON HER IT WOULD BE PURE USELESS SUFFERING TO YOU SEVERE SUFFERING I FEAR SHE IS VERY MUCH CHANGED ADAM STARTED UP FROM HIS CHAIR
2817-142380-0011 AND SEIZED HIS HAT WHICH LAY ON THE TABLE BUT HE STOOD STILL THEN AND LOOKED AT MISTER IRWINE AS IF HE HAD A QUESTION TO ASK WHICH IT WAS YET DIFFICULT TO UTTER BARTLE MASSEY ROSE QUIETLY TURNED THE KEY IN THE DOOR
2817-142380-0012 AND PUT IT IN HIS POCKET IS HE COME BACK SAID ADAM AT LAST NO HE IS NOT SAID MISTER IRWINE QUIETLY LAY DOWN YOUR HAT ADAM UNLESS YOU LIKE TO WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A LITTLE FRESH AIR
2817-142380-0013 I FEAR YOU HAVE NOT BEEN OUT AGAIN TO DAY YOU NEEDN'T DECEIVE ME SIR SAID ADAM LOOKING HARD AT MISTER IRWINE AND SPEAKING IN A TONE OF ANGRY SUSPICION YOU NEEDN'T BE AFRAID OF ME I ONLY WANT JUSTICE
2817-142380-0014 I WANT HIM TO FEEL WHAT SHE FEELS IT'S HIS WORK SHE WAS A CHILD AS IT UD HA GONE T ANYBODY'S HEART TO LOOK AT I DON'T CARE WHAT SHE'S DONE IT WAS HIM BROUGHT HER TO IT AND HE SHALL KNOW IT HE SHALL FEEL IT
2817-142380-0015 TO SIN AND MISERY I'M NOT DECEIVING YOU ADAM SAID MISTER IRWINE ARTHUR DONNITHORNE IS NOT COME BACK WAS NOT COME BACK WHEN I LEFT I HAVE LEFT A LETTER FOR HIM HE WILL KNOW
2817-142380-0016 HE WILL KNOW HE WILL SUFFER LONG AND BITTERLY HE HAS A HEART AND A CONSCIENCE I CAN'T BE ENTIRELY DECEIVED IN HIS CHARACTER I AM CONVINCED
2817-142380-0017 HE MAY BE WEAK BUT HE IS NOT CALLOUS NOT COLDLY SELFISH I AM PERSUADED
2817-142380-0018 ALL HIS LIFE WHY DO YOU CRAVE VENGEANCE IN THIS WAY NO AMOUNT OF TORTURE THAT YOU COULD INFLICT ON HIM COULD BENEFIT HER NO O GOD NO ADAM GROANED OUT SINKING ON HIS CHAIR AGAIN
2817-142380-0019 BUT THEN THAT'S THE DEEPEST CURSE OF ALL THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE BLACKNESS OF IT IT CAN NEVER BE UNDONE MY POOR HETTY SHE CAN NEVER BE MY SWEET HETTY AGAIN THE PRETTIEST THING GOD HAD MADE
2817-142380-0020 SMILING UP AT ME I THOUGHT SHE LOVED ME AND WAS GOOD ADAM'S VOICE HAD BEEN GRADUALLY SINKING INTO A HOARSE UNDERTONE AS IF HE WERE ONLY TALKING TO HIMSELF BUT NOW HE SAID ABRUPTLY LOOKING AT MISTER IRWINE
2817-142380-0021 BUT SHE ISN'T AS GUILTY AS THEY SAY YOU DON'T THINK SHE IS SIR SHE CAN'T HA DONE IT THAT PERHAPS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY ADAM MISTER IRWINE ANSWERED GENTLY
2817-142380-0022 IN THESE CASES WE SOMETIMES FORM OUR JUDGMENT ON WHAT SEEMS TO US STRONG EVIDENCE AND YET FOR WANT OF KNOWING SOME SMALL FACT OUR JUDGMENT IS WRONG BUT SUPPOSE THE WORST YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY
2817-142380-0023 THAT THE GUILT OF HER CRIME LIES WITH HIM AND THAT HE OUGHT TO BEAR THE PUNISHMENT IT IS NOT FOR US MEN TO APPORTION THE SHARES OF MORAL GUILT AND RETRIBUTION WE FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID MISTAKES
2817-142380-0024 EVEN IN DETERMINING WHO HAS COMMITTED A SINGLE CRIMINAL ACT AND THE PROBLEM
2817-142380-0025 YOU HAVE A MIND THAT CAN UNDERSTAND THIS FULLY ADAM WHEN YOU ARE CALM DON'T SUPPOSE I CAN'T ENTER INTO THE ANGUISH THAT DRIVES YOU INTO THIS STATE OF REVENGEFUL HATRED BUT
2817-142380-0026 FOR IT IS PASSION AND YOU DECEIVE YOURSELF IN CALLING IT JUSTICE IT MIGHT BE WITH YOU PRECISELY AS IT HAS BEEN WITH ARTHUR NAY WORSE YOUR PASSION MIGHT LEAD YOU YOURSELF INTO A HORRIBLE CRIME
2817-142380-0027 NO NOT WORSE SAID ADAM BITTERLY I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S WORSE I'D SOONER DO IT I'D SOONER DO A WICKEDNESS AS I COULD SUFFER FOR BY MYSELF THAN HA BROUGHT HER TO DO WICKEDNESS
2817-142380-0028 AND THEN STAND BY AND SEE EM PUNISH HER WHILE THEY LET ME ALONE AND ALL FOR A BIT O PLEASURE AS IF HE'D HAD A MAN'S HEART IN HIM HE'D HA CUT HIS HAND OFF SOONER THAN HE'D HA TAKEN IT WHAT IF HE DIDN'T FORESEE WHAT'S HAPPENED
2817-142380-0029 HE FORESAW ENOUGH HE'D NO RIGHT TO EXPECT ANYTHING BUT HARM AND SHAME TO HER
2817-142380-0030 NOT HALF SO HATEFUL AS THAT LET A MAN DO WHAT HE WILL IF HE KNOWS HE'S TO BEAR THE PUNISHMENT HIMSELF
2817-142380-0031 AND KNOWS ALL THE WHILE THE PUNISHMENT LL FALL ON SOMEBODY ELSE THERE AGAIN YOU PARTLY DECEIVE YOURSELF ADAM THERE IS NO SORT OF WRONG DEED OF WHICH A MAN CAN BEAR THE PUNISHMENT ALONE YOU CAN'T ISOLATE YOURSELF
2817-142380-0032 I FEEL THE TERRIBLE EXTENT OF SUFFERING THIS SIN OF ARTHUR'S HAS CAUSED TO OTHERS BUT SO DOES EVERY SIN CAUSE SUFFERING TO OTHERS BESIDES THOSE WHO COMMIT IT AN ACT OF VENGEANCE ON YOUR PART AGAINST ARTHUR WOULD SIMPLY BE ANOTHER EVIL
2817-142380-0033 ADDED TO THOSE WE ARE SUFFERING UNDER YOU COULD NOT BEAR THE PUNISHMENT ALONE YOU WOULD ENTAIL THE WORST SORROWS ON EVERY ONE WHO LOVES YOU YOU WOULD HAVE COMMITTED AN ACT OF BLIND FURY THAT WOULD LEAVE ALL THE PRESENT EVILS JUST AS THEY WERE
2817-142380-0034 AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT SEE THAT TO FIX YOUR MIND ON ARTHUR'S PUNISHMENT IS REVENGE AND NOT JUSTICE YOU ARE IN DANGER OF BEING LED ON TO THE COMMISSION OF SOME GREAT WRONG REMEMBER WHAT YOU TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS
2817-142380-0035 AFTER YOU HAD GIVEN THAT BLOW TO ARTHUR IN THE GROVE ADAM WAS SILENT THE LAST WORDS HAD CALLED UP A VIVID IMAGE OF THE PAST AND MISTER IRWINE LEFT HIM TO HIS THOUGHTS
2817-142380-0036 WHILE HE SPOKE TO BARTLE MASSEY ABOUT OLD MISTER DONNITHORNE'S FUNERAL AND OTHER MATTERS OF AN INDIFFERENT KIND BUT AT LENGTH ADAM TURNED ROUND AND SAID IN A MORE SUBDUED TONE
2817-142380-0037 IS DINAH MORRIS COME TO EM SIR SETH SAID THEY'D SENT FOR HER NO MISTER POYSER TELLS ME SHE WAS NOT COME WHEN HE LEFT THEY'RE AFRAID THE LETTER HAS NOT REACHED HER
2817-142380-0038 IT SEEMS THEY HAD NO EXACT ADDRESS ADAM SAT RUMINATING A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN SAID
2817-142380-0039 BUT PERHAPS THE POYSERS
2817-142380-0040 SINCE THEY WON'T COME NIGH HER THEMSELVES BUT I THINK SHE WOULD FOR THE METHODISTS ARE GREAT FOLKS FOR GOING INTO THE PRISONS AND SETH SAID HE THOUGHT SHE WOULD SHE'D A VERY TENDER WAY WITH HER DINAH HAD
2817-142380-0041 YOU NEVER SAW HER SIR DID YOU YES I DID I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH HER SHE PLEASED ME A GOOD DEAL AND NOW YOU MENTION IT I WISH SHE WOULD COME FOR IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A GENTLE MILD WOMAN LIKE HER
2817-142380-0042 IF I'D THOUGHT OF IT EARLIER I WOULD HAVE TAKEN SOME MEASURES FOR FINDING HER OUT SAID MISTER IRWINE BUT IT'S TOO LATE NOW I FEAR WELL ADAM I MUST GO NOW TRY TO GET SOME REST TO NIGHT

2836-5354-0001 TAKING ONE ABSENCE WITH THE OTHER HE HAD BEEN AWAY FROM HER CHIEFLY IN PARIS PURSUING HIS OWN COURSE AND HIS OWN PLEASURE HOW FARED IT WITH LADY ISABEL JUST AS IT MUST BE EXPECTED TO FARE AND DOES FARE
2836-5354-0002 WHEN A HIGH PRINCIPLED GENTLEWOMAN FALLS FROM HER PEDESTAL NEVER HAD SHE EXPERIENCED A MOMENT'S CALM OR PEACE OR HAPPINESS SINCE THE FATAL NIGHT OF QUITTING HER HOME SHE HAD TAKEN A BLIND LEAP IN A MOMENT OF WILD PASSION
2836-5354-0003 WHEN INSTEAD OF THE GARDEN OF ROSES IT HAD BEEN HER PERSUADER'S PLEASURE TO PROMISE HER SHE WOULD FALL INTO BUT WHICH IN TRUTH SHE HAD BARELY GLANCED AT FOR THAT HAD NOT BEEN HER MOVING MOTIVE
2836-5354-0004 SHE HAD FOUND HERSELF PLUNGED INTO A YAWNING ABYSS OF HORROR FROM WHICH THERE WAS NEVER MORE ANY ESCAPE NEVER MORE NEVER MORE THE VERY INSTANT THE VERY NIGHT OF HER DEPARTURE SHE AWOKE TO WHAT SHE HAD DONE THE GUILT
2836-5354-0005 WHOSE ASPECT HAD BEEN SHUNNED IN THE PROSPECTIVE ASSUMED AT ONCE ITS TRUE FRIGHTFUL COLOR THE BLACKNESS OF DARKNESS AND A LIVELY REMORSE A NEVER DYING ANGUISH TOOK POSSESSION OF HER SOUL FOREVER OH READER BELIEVE ME
2836-5354-0006 LADY WIFE MOTHER SHOULD YOU EVER BE TEMPTED TO ABANDON YOUR HOME SO WILL YOU AWAKE WHATEVER TRIALS MAY BE THE LOT OF YOUR MARRIED LIFE THOUGH THEY MAY MAGNIFY THEMSELVES TO YOUR CRUSHED SPIRIT AS BEYOND THE NATURE
2836-5354-0007 THE ENDURANCE OF WOMAN TO BEAR RESOLVE TO BEAR THEM FALL DOWN UPON YOUR KNEES AND PRAY TO BE ENABLED TO BEAR THEM PRAY FOR PATIENCE PRAY FOR STRENGTH TO RESIST THE DEMON THAT WOULD TEMPT YOU TO ESCAPE BEAR UNTO DEATH
2836-5354-0008 RATHER THAN FORFEIT YOUR FAIR NAME AND YOUR GOOD CONSCIENCE FOR BE ASSURED THAT THE ALTERNATIVE IF YOU DO RUSH ON TO IT WILL BE FOUND WORSE THAN DEATH POOR THING POOR LADY ISABEL SHE HAD SACRIFICED HUSBAND CHILDREN
2836-5354-0009 REPUTATION HOME ALL THAT MAKES LIFE OF VALUE TO WOMAN SHE HAD FORFEITED HER DUTY TO GOD HAD DELIBERATELY BROKEN HIS COMMANDMENTS FOR THE ONE POOR MISERABLE MISTAKE OF FLYING WITH FRANCIS LEVISON
2836-5354-0010 BUT THE INSTANT THE STEP WAS IRREVOCABLE THE INSTANT SHE HAD LEFT THE BARRIER BEHIND REPENTANCE SET IN EVEN IN THE FIRST DAYS OF HER DEPARTURE IN THE FLEETING MOMENTS OF ABANDONMENT WHEN IT MAY BE SUPPOSED SHE MIGHT MOMENTARILY FORGET CONSCIENCE
2836-5354-0011 IT WAS SHARPLY WOUNDING HER WITH ITS ADDER STINGS AND SHE KNEW THAT HER WHOLE FUTURE EXISTENCE WHETHER SPENT WITH THAT MAN OR WITHOUT HIM WOULD BE A DARK COURSE OF GNAWING RETRIBUTION NEARLY A YEAR WENT BY SAVE SOME SIX OR EIGHT WEEKS
2836-5354-0012 FURNISHED IN THE VICINITY OF THE PLACE GRENETTE A WINDY OLD HOUSE IT WAS FULL OF DOORS AND WINDOWS CHIMNEYS AND CUPBOARDS AND HE SAID HE SHOULD REMAIN THERE LADY ISABEL REMONSTRATED
2836-5354-0013 SHE WISHED TO GO FARTHER ON WHERE THEY MIGHT GET QUICKER NEWS FROM ENGLAND BUT HER WILL NOW WAS AS NOTHING SHE WAS LOOKING LIKE THE GHOST OF HER FORMER SELF TALK OF HER HAVING LOOKED ILL WHEN SHE TOOK THAT VOYAGE OVER THE WATER WITH MISTER CARLYLE YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HER NOW
2836-5354-0014 MISERY MARKS THE COUNTENANCE WORSE THAN SICKNESS HER FACE WAS WHITE AND WORN HER HANDS WERE THIN HER EYES WERE SUNKEN AND SURROUNDED BY A BLACK CIRCLE CARE WAS DIGGING CAVES FOR THEM
2836-5354-0015 A STRANGER MIGHT HAVE ATTRIBUTED THESE SIGNS TO THE STATE OF HER HEALTH SHE KNEW BETTER KNEW THAT THEY WERE THE EFFECTS OF HER WRETCHED MIND AND HEART IT WAS VERY LATE FOR BREAKFAST BUT WHY SHOULD SHE RISE EARLY ONLY TO DRAG THROUGH ANOTHER ENDLESS DAY

2836-5354-0017 AND ALL THE TIME THE SLY FOX HAD GOT THE TIMES IN HIS COAT POCKET BUT HE WAS ONLY OBEYING THE ORDERS OF HIS MASTER IT HAD BEEN CAPTAIN LEVISON'S RECENT PLEASURE THAT THE NEWSPAPERS SHOULD NOT BE SEEN BY LADY ISABEL UNTIL HE HAD OVER LOOKED THEM

2836-5354-0020 LITTLE THOUGHT SHE THAT THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST INTENTION ON HIS PART TO MAKE HER REPARATION ANY MORE THAN HE HAD MADE IT TO OTHERS WHO HAD GONE BEFORE HER SHE HAD BECOME PAINFULLY AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THE MAN FOR WHOM SHE HAD CHOSEN TO SACRIFICE HERSELF

2836-5354-0050 SHE HAD HAD A LONG ILLNESS TERMINATING IN A LOW FEVER
2836-5354-0051 THAT MILADI WOULD SOON GET ABOUT IF SHE WOULD ONLY ROUSE HERSELF SHE HAD GOT SO FAR ABOUT AS TO SIT UP IN THE WINDY CHAMBER AND IT SEEMED TO BE TO HER A MATTER OF PERFECT INDIFFERENCE WHETHER SHE EVER GOT OUT OF IT

2836-5355-0004 YOUR WORDS ARE NOT WORDS OF TRUTH BUT OF DECEIT YOU DID NOT INTEND TO BE BACK IN TIME FOR THE MARRIAGE
2836-5355-0005 WHAT FANCIES YOU DO TAKE UP UTTERED FRANCIS LEVISON SOME TIME SUBSEQUENT TO YOUR DEPARTURE SHE QUIETLY WENT ON ONE OF THE MAIDS WAS SETTING TO RIGHTS THE CLOTHES IN YOUR DRESSING CLOSET AND SHE BROUGHT ME A LETTER SHE FOUND IN ONE OF THE POCKETS
2836-5355-0006 I SAW BY THE DATE THAT IT WAS ONE OF THOSE TWO WHICH YOU RECEIVED ON THE MORNING OF YOUR DEPARTURE IT CONTAINED THE INFORMATION THAT THE DIVORCE WAS PRONOUNCED SHE SPOKE SO QUIETLY SO APPARENTLY WITHOUT FEELING OR PASSION THAT SIR FRANCIS WAS AGREEABLY ASTONISHED
2836-5355-0007 HE SHOULD HAVE LESS TROUBLE IN THROWING OFF THE MASK BUT HE WAS AN ILL TEMPERED MAN AND TO HEAR THAT THE LETTER HAD BEEN FOUND TO HAVE THE FALSENESS OF HIS FINE PROTESTATIONS AND PROMISES LAID BARE DID NOT IMPROVE HIS TEMPER NOW LADY ISABEL CONTINUED
2836-5355-0008 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO HAVE UNDECEIVED ME THEN TO HAVE TOLD ME THAT THE HOPES I WAS CHERISHING FOR THE SAKE OF THE UNBORN CHILD WERE WORSE THAN VAIN I DID NOT JUDGE SO HE REPLIED THE EXCITED STATE YOU THEN APPEARED TO BE IN
2836-5355-0009 WOULD HAVE PRECLUDED YOUR LISTENING TO ANY SORT OF REASON HER HEART BEAT A LITTLE QUICKER BUT SHE STILLED IT YOU DEEM THAT IT WAS NOT IN REASON THAT I SHOULD ASPIRE TO BE THE WIFE OF SIR FRANCIS LEVISON HE ROSE AND BEGAN KICKING AT THE LOGS WITH THE HEEL OF HIS BOOT THIS TIME
2836-5355-0010 WELL ISABEL YOU MUST BE AWARE THAT IT IS AN AWFUL SACRIFICE FOR A MAN IN MY POSITION TO MARRY A DIVORCED WOMAN THE HECTIC FLUSHED INTO HER THIN CHEEKS BUT HER VOICE SOUNDED CALM AS BEFORE
2836-5355-0011 WHEN I EXPECTED OR WISHED FOR THE SACRIFICE IT WAS NOT FOR MY OWN SAKE I TOLD YOU SO THEN BUT IT WAS NOT MADE AND THE CHILD'S INHERITANCE IS THAT OF SIN AND SHAME THERE HE LIES SIR FRANCIS HALF TURNED TO WHERE SHE POINTED
2836-5355-0012 AND SAW AN INFANT'S CRADLE BY THE SIDE OF THE BED HE DID NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE TO LOOK AT IT I AM THE REPRESENTATIVE NOW OF AN ANCIENT AND RESPECTED BARONETCY HE RESUMED IN A TONE AS OF APOLOGY FOR HIS PREVIOUS HEARTLESS WORDS
2836-5355-0013 AND TO MAKE YOU MY WIFE WOULD SO OFFEND ALL MY FAMILY THAT STAY INTERRUPTED LADY ISABEL YOU NEED NOT TROUBLE YOURSELF TO FIND NEEDLESS EXCUSES HAD YOU TAKEN THIS JOURNEY FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING ME YOUR WIFE WERE YOU TO PROPOSE TO DO SO THIS DAY
2836-5355-0014 AND BRING A CLERGYMAN INTO THE ROOM TO PERFORM THE CEREMONY IT WOULD BE FUTILE THE INJURY TO THE CHILD CAN NEVER BE REPAIRED AND FOR MYSELF I CANNOT IMAGINE ANY FATE IN LIFE WORSE THAN BEING COMPELLED TO PASS IT WITH YOU
2836-5355-0015 IF YOU HAVE TAKEN THIS AVERSION TO ME IT CANNOT BE HELPED HE COLDLY SAID INWARDLY CONGRATULATING HIMSELF LET US NOT DOUBT AT BEING SPARED THE WORK OF TROUBLE HE HAD ANTICIPATED YOU MADE COMMOTION ENOUGH ONCE ABOUT ME MAKING YOU REPARATION
2836-5355-0016 SHE SHOOK HER HEAD ALL THE REPARATION IN YOUR POWER TO MAKE ALL THE REPARATION THAT THE WHOLE WORLD CAN INVENT COULD NOT UNDO MY SIN IT AND THE EFFECTS MUST LIE UPON ME FOREVER OH SIN WAS THE DERISIVE EXCLAMATION
2836-5355-0017 YOU LADIES SHOULD THINK OF THAT BEFOREHAND YES SHE SADLY ANSWERED MAY HEAVEN HELP ALL TO DO SO WHO MAY BE TEMPTED AS I WAS IF YOU MEAN THAT AS A REPROACH TO ME IT'S RATHER OUT OF PLACE CHAFED SIR FRANCIS
2836-5355-0018 WHOSE FITS OF ILL TEMPER WERE UNDER NO CONTROL AND WHO NEVER WHEN IN THEM CARED WHAT HE SAID TO OUTRAGE THE FEELINGS OF ANOTHER THE TEMPTATION TO SIN AS YOU CALL IT LAY NOT IN MY PERSUASIONS HALF SO MUCH AS IN YOUR JEALOUS ANGER TOWARD YOUR HUSBAND
2836-5355-0019 QUITE TRUE WAS HER REPLY AND I BELIEVE YOU WERE ON THE WRONG SCENT ISABEL IF IT WILL BE ANY SATISFACTION TO YOU TO HEAR IT SINCE WE ARE MUTUALLY ON THIS COMPLIMENTARY DISCOURSE IT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO SMOOTH OVER FACTS
2836-5355-0020 I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WOULD IMPLY SHE SAID DRAWING HER SHAWL ROUND HER WITH A FRESH SHIVER HOW ON THE WRONG SCENT WITH REGARD TO YOUR HUSBAND AND THAT HARE GIRL YOU WERE BLINDLY OUTRAGEOUSLY JEALOUS OF HIM GO ON
2836-5355-0021 AND I SAY I THINK YOU ARE ON THE WRONG SCENT I DO NOT BELIEVE MISTER CARLYLE EVER THOUGHT OF THE GIRL IN THAT WAY WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE GASPED THEY HAD A SECRET BETWEEN THEM NOT OF LOVE A SECRET OF BUSINESS AND THOSE INTERVIEWS THEY HAD TOGETHER
2836-5355-0022 HER DANCING ATTENDANCE UPON HIM PERPETUALLY RELATED TO THAT AND THAT ALONE HER FACE WAS MORE FLUSHED THAN IT HAD BEEN THROUGHOUT THE INTERVIEW HE SPOKE QUIETLY NOW QUITE IN AN EQUAL TONE OF REASONING IT WAS HIS WAY WHEN THE ILL TEMPER WAS UPON HIM
2836-5355-0023 AND THE CALMER HE SPOKE THE MORE CUTTING WERE HIS WORDS HE NEED NOT HAVE TOLD HER THIS WHAT WAS THE SECRET SHE INQUIRED IN A LOW TONE NAY I CAN'T EXPLAIN ALL THEY DID NOT TAKE ME INTO THEIR CONFIDENCE THEY DID NOT EVEN TAKE YOU
2836-5355-0024 AND CARLYLE WAS ACTING IN IT UNDER THE ROSE FOR MISSUS HARE SHE COULD NOT SEEK OUT CARLYLE HERSELF SO SHE SENT THE YOUNG LADY THAT'S ALL I KNOW HOW DID YOU KNOW IT I HAD REASON TO THINK SO
2836-5355-0025 WHAT REASON I MUST REQUEST YOU TO TELL ME I OVERHEARD SCRAPS OF THEIR CONVERSATION NOW AND THEN IN THOSE MEETINGS AND SO GATHERED MY INFORMATION YOU TOLD A DIFFERENT TALE TO ME SIR FRANCIS WAS HER REMARK
2836-5355-0026 AS SHE TURNED HER INDIGNANT EYES TOWARD HIM SIR FRANCIS LAUGHED ALL STRATAGEMS ARE FAIR IN LOVE AND WAR SHE DARED NOT IMMEDIATELY TRUST HERSELF TO REPLY AND A SILENCE ENSUED SIR FRANCIS BROKE IT POINTING WITH HIS LEFT THUMB
2836-5355-0027 OVER HIS SHOULDER IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CRADLE WHAT HAVE YOU NAMED THAT YOUNG ARTICLE THERE THE NAME WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN HIS BY INHERITANCE
2836-5355-0028 WAS HER ICY ANSWER LET'S SEE HOW OLD IS HE NOW HE WAS BORN ON THE LAST DAY OF AUGUST SIR FRANCIS THREW UP HIS ARMS AND STRETCHED HIMSELF AS IF A FIT OF IDLENESS HAD OVERTAKEN HIM THEN ADVANCED TO THE CRADLE AND PULLED DOWN THE CLOTHES
2836-5355-0029 WHO IS HE LIKE ISABEL MY HANDSOME SELF WERE HE LIKE YOU IN SPIRIT I WOULD PRAY THAT HE MIGHT DIE ERE HE COULD SPEAK OR THINK SHE BURST FORTH AND THEN REMEMBERING THE RESOLUTION MARKED OUT FOR HERSELF SUBSIDED
2836-5355-0030 OUTWARDLY INTO CALMNESS AGAIN WHAT ELSE RETORTED SIR FRANCIS YOU KNOW MY DISPOSITION PRETTY WELL BY THIS TIME ISABEL AND MAY BE SURE THAT IF YOU DEAL OUT SMALL CHANGE TO ME
2836-5355-0031 SHE MADE NO REPLY SIR FRANCIS PUT THE CLOTHES BACK OVER THE SLEEPING CHILD RETURNED TO THE FIRE AND STOOD A FEW MOMENTS WITH HIS BACK TO IT IS MY ROOM PREPARED FOR ME DO YOU KNOW HE PRESENTLY ASKED NO IT IS NOT SHE QUIETLY REJOINED

2836-5355-0043 RESUMED SIR FRANCIS IN A LITTLE TIME YOU MAY PROBABLY WISH TO RECALL IT IN WHICH CASE A LINE ADDRESSED TO ME AT MY BANKER'S WILL LADY ISABEL DREW HERSELF UP PUT AWAY THOSE NOTES IF YOU PLEASE SHE INTERRUPTED NOT ALLOWING HIM TO FINISH HIS SENTENCE
2836-5355-0044 HE TOOK OUT HIS POCKET BOOK AND PLACED THE BANK NOTES WITHIN IT YOUR CLOTHES
2836-5355-0045 YOU WILL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO ORDER PIERRE TO TAKE AWAY THIS AFTERNOON AND NOW SIR FRANCIS I BELIEVE THAT IS ALL WE WILL PART TO REMAIN MORTAL ENEMIES FROM HENCEFORTH IS THAT TO BE IT TO BE STRANGERS SHE REPLIED CORRECTING HIM
2836-5355-0046 I WISH YOU A GOOD DAY SO YOU WILL NOT EVEN SHAKE HANDS WITH ME ISABEL I WOULD PREFER NOT AND THUS THEY PARTED SIR FRANCIS LEFT THE ROOM BUT NOT IMMEDIATELY THE HOUSE HE WENT INTO A DISTANT APARTMENT
2836-5355-0047 AND CALLING THE SERVANTS BEFORE HIM THERE WERE BUT TWO GAVE THEM EACH A YEAR'S WAGES IN ADVANCE
2836-5355-0048 THEN HE PAID A VISIT TO THE LANDLORD AND HANDED HIM LIKEWISE A YEAR'S RENT IN ADVANCE MAKING THE SAME REMARK AFTER THAT HE ORDERED DINNER AT A HOTEL AND THE SAME NIGHT HE AND PIERRE DEPARTED ON THEIR JOURNEY HOME AGAIN
2836-5355-0049 SIR FRANCIS THANKING HIS LUCKY STAR THAT HE HAD SO EASILY GOT RID OF A VEXATIOUS ANNOYANCE AND LADY ISABEL SHE PASSED HER EVENING ALONE SITTING IN THE SAME PLACE CLOSE TO THE FIRE AND THE SPARKS
2836-5355-0050 INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM WHEN LADY ISABEL LAY DOWN TO REST SHE SANK INTO A SOMEWHAT CALMER SLEEP THAN SHE HAD KNOWN OF LATE ALSO INTO A DREAM SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS BACK AT EAST LYNNE NOT BACK IN ONE SENSE
2836-5355-0051 BUT THAT SHE SEEMED NEVER TO HAVE GONE AWAY FROM IT WALKING IN THE FLOWER GARDEN WITH MISTER CARLYLE WHILE THE THREE CHILDREN PLAYED ON THE LAWN HER ARM WAS WITHIN HER HUSBAND'S AND HE WAS RELATING SOMETHING TO HER WHAT THE NEWS WAS SHE COULD NOT REMEMBER AFTERWARD
2836-5355-0052 EXCEPTING THAT IT WAS CONNECTED WITH THE OFFICE AND OLD MISTER DILL AND THAT MISTER CARLYLE LAUGHED WHEN HE TOLD IT THEY APPEARED TO BE INTERRUPTED BY THE CRYING OF ARCHIBALD AND IN TURNING TO THE LAWN TO ASK WHAT WAS THE MATTER SHE AWOKE
2836-5355-0053 ALAS IT WAS THE ACTUAL CRYING OF HER OWN CHILD WHICH AWOKE HER THIS LAST CHILD THE ILL FATED LITTLE BEING IN THE CRADLE BESIDE HER
2843-152918-0000 THEY HAD UNDERGONE A REMARKABLE CHANGE SINCE OUR ARRIVAL AT THE BUTCHER'S SHOP THEY NOW WANDERED ABOUT FAT SLEEK AND CONTENTED AND THEIR FORMER VORACITY HAD COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED
2843-152918-0001 AS REGARDS OURSELVES A DAY OR TWO LONGER MADE NO DIFFERENCE OUR MOST IMPORTANT ARTICLE OF DIET THE PEMMICAN WAS PRACTICALLY LEFT UNTOUCHED AS FOR THE TIME BEING DOG HAD COMPLETELY TAKEN ITS PLACE
2843-152918-0002 THERE WAS THUS NO GREAT SIGN OF DEPRESSION TO BE NOTICED WHEN WE CAME BACK INTO THE TENT AFTER FINISHING OUR WORK AND HAD TO WHILE AWAY THE TIME AS I WENT IN I COULD DESCRY WISTING A LITTLE WAY OFF KNEELING ON THE GROUND
2843-152918-0003 AND ENGAGED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF CUTLETS THE DOGS STOOD IN A RING ROUND HIM AND LOOKED ON WITH INTEREST THE NORTH EAST WIND WHISTLED AND HOWLED THE AIR WAS THICK WITH DRIVING SNOW AND WISTING WAS NOT TO BE ENVIED
2843-152918-0004 TO WHATEVER AGE I MAY LIVE IN THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT THE WIND HAD GONE BACK TO THE NORTH AND INCREASED TO A GALE IT WAS BLOWING AND SNOWING SO THAT WHEN WE CAME OUT IN THE MORNING WE COULD NOT SEE THE SLEDGES THEY WERE HALF SNOWED UNDER
2843-152918-0005 THE TEMPERATURE WAS NOT SO VERY LOW
2843-152918-0006 WE HAD ALL TAKEN A TURN OUTSIDE TO LOOK AT THE WEATHER AND WERE SITTING ON OUR SLEEPING BAGS DISCUSSING THE POOR PROSPECT IT'S THE DEVIL'S OWN WEATHER HERE AT THE BUTCHER'S SAID ONE IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT WOULD NEVER GET ANY BETTER
2843-152918-0007 THIS IS THE FIFTH DAY AND IT'S BLOWING WORSE THAN EVER WE ALL AGREED THERE'S NOTHING SO BAD AS LYING WEATHER BOUND LIKE THIS CONTINUED ANOTHER IT TAKES MORE OUT OF YOU THAN GOING FROM MORNING TO NIGHT PERSONALLY I WAS OF THE SAME OPINION
2843-152918-0008 ONE DAY MAY BE PLEASANT ENOUGH BUT TWO THREE FOUR
2843-152918-0009 NO IT WAS AWFUL SHALL WE TRY IT NO SOONER WAS THE PROPOSAL SUBMITTED THAN IT WAS ACCEPTED UNANIMOUSLY AND WITH ACCLAMATION WHEN I THINK OF MY FOUR FRIENDS OF THE SOUTHERN JOURNEY
2843-152918-0010 IT IS THE MEMORY OF THAT MORNING THAT COMES FIRST TO MY MIND ALL THE QUALITIES THAT I MOST ADMIRE IN A MAN WERE CLEARLY SHOWN AT THAT JUNCTURE COURAGE AND DAUNTLESSNESS WITHOUT BOASTING OR BIG WORDS
2843-152918-0011 AMID JOKING AND CHAFF EVERYTHING WAS PACKED AND THEN OUT INTO THE BLIZZARD IT WAS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP ONE'S EYES OPEN THE FINE DRIFT SNOW PENETRATED EVERYWHERE
2843-152918-0012 THE DOGS WERE NOT MUCH INCLINED TO START AND IT TOOK TIME TO GET THEM INTO THEIR HARNESS BUT AT LAST WE WERE READY ONE MORE GLANCE OVER THE CAMPING GROUND TO SEE THAT NOTHING WE OUGHT TO HAVE WITH US HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN
2843-152918-0013 WHICH WE NOW THOUGHT WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED WERE LEFT BEHIND THE LAST THING TO BE DONE WAS PLANTING A BROKEN SKI UPRIGHT BY THE SIDE OF THE DEPOT IT WAS WISTING WHO DID THIS THINKING PRESUMABLY THAT AN EXTRA MARK WOULD DO NO HARM
2843-152918-0014 THAT IT WAS A HAPPY THOUGHT THE FUTURE WILL SHOW AND THEN WE WERE OFF IT WAS A HARD PULL TO BEGIN WITH BOTH FOR MEN AND BEASTS AS THE HIGH SASTRUGI CONTINUED TOWARDS THE SOUTH
2843-152918-0015 AND MADE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ADVANCE THOSE WHO HAD SLEDGES TO DRIVE HAD TO BE VERY ATTENTIVE AND SUPPORT THEM SO THAT THEY DID NOT CAPSIZE ON THE BIG WAVES AND WE WHO HAD NO SLEDGES FOUND GREAT DIFFICULTY IN KEEPING OUR FEET
2843-152918-0016 AS WE HAD NOTHING TO LEAN AGAINST WE WENT ON LIKE THIS SLOWLY ENOUGH BUT THE MAIN THING WAS THAT WE MADE PROGRESS THE GROUND AT FIRST GAVE ONE THE IMPRESSION OF RISING THOUGH NOT MUCH THE GOING WAS EXTREMELY HEAVY
2843-152918-0017 IT WAS LIKE DRAGGING ONESELF THROUGH SAND MEANWHILE THE SASTRUGI GREW SMALLER AND SMALLER AND FINALLY THEY DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER AND THE SURFACE BECAME QUITE FLAT THE GOING ALSO IMPROVED BY DEGREES
2843-152918-0018 FOR WHAT REASON IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY AS THE STORM CONTINUED UNABATED AND THE DRIFT NOW COMBINED WITH FALLING SNOW WAS THICKER THAN EVER IT WAS ALL THE DRIVER COULD DO TO SEE HIS OWN DOGS THE SURFACE
2843-152918-0019 WHICH HAD BECOME PERFECTLY LEVEL HAD THE APPEARANCE AT TIMES OF SINKING IN ANY CASE ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SO FROM THE PACE OF THE SLEDGES NOW AND AGAIN THE DOGS WOULD SET OFF SUDDENLY AT A GALLOP THE WIND AFT NO DOUBT HELPED THE PACE SOMEWHAT
2843-152918-0020 BUT IT ALONE COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE CHANGE I DID NOT LIKE THIS TENDENCY OF THE GROUND TO FALL AWAY IN MY OPINION WE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE WITH ANYTHING OF THAT SORT AFTER REACHING THE HEIGHT AT WHICH WE WERE A SLIGHT SLOPE UPWARD
2843-152918-0021 POSSIBLY BUT DOWN NO THAT DID NOT AGREE WITH MY RECKONING SO FAR THE INCLINE HAD NOT BEEN SO GREAT AS TO CAUSE UNEASINESS BUT IF IT SERIOUSLY BEGAN TO GO DOWNHILL WE SHOULD HAVE TO STOP AND CAMP
2843-152918-0022 WOULD BE MADNESS WE MIGHT RISK FALLING INTO SOME CHASM BEFORE WE HAD TIME TO PULL UP HANSSEN AS USUAL WAS DRIVING FIRST STRICTLY SPEAKING I SHOULD NOW HAVE BEEN GOING IN ADVANCE BUT THE UNEVEN SURFACE AT THE START
2843-152918-0023 AND THE RAPID PACE AFTERWARDS HAD MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO WALK AS FAST THE DOGS COULD PULL I WAS THEREFORE FOLLOWING BY THE SIDE OF WISTING'S SLEDGE AND CHATTING WITH HIM SUDDENLY I SAW HANSSEN'S DOGS SHOOT AHEAD
2843-152918-0024 AND DOWNHILL THEY WENT AT THE WILDEST PACE WISTING AFTER THEM I SHOUTED TO HANSSEN TO STOP
2843-152918-0025 BY TWISTING HIS SLEDGE THE OTHERS WHO WERE FOLLOWING STOPPED WHEN THEY CAME UP TO HIM WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FAIRLY STEEP DESCENT WHAT THERE MIGHT BE BELOW WAS NOT EASY TO DECIDE NOR WOULD WE TRY TO FIND OUT IN THAT WEATHER
2843-152918-0026 WE TRAMPLED DOWN A PLACE FOR THE TENT IN THE LOOSE SNOW AND SOON GOT IT UP IT WAS NOT A LONG DAY'S MARCH THAT WE HAD DONE ELEVEN AND THREE QUARTER MILES BUT WE HAD PUT AN END TO OUR STAY AT THE BUTCHER'S SHOP AND THAT WAS A GREAT THING
2843-152918-0027 THE BOILING POINT TEST THAT EVENING SHOWED THAT WE WERE TEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE SEA AND THAT WE HAD THUS GONE DOWN SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FEET FROM THE BUTCHER'S WE TURNED IN AND WENT TO SLEEP AS SOON AS IT BRIGHTENED
2843-152918-0028 ONE HAS TO SEIZE EVERY OPPORTUNITY IN THESE REGIONS IF ONE NEGLECTS TO DO SO IT MAY MEAN A LONG WAIT AND MUCH MAY BE LOST WE THEREFORE ALL SLEPT WITH ONE EYE OPEN
2843-152918-0029 AND WE KNEW WELL THAT NOTHING COULD HAPPEN WITHOUT OUR NOTICING IT AT THREE IN THE MORNING THE SUN CUT THROUGH THE CLOUDS AND WE THROUGH THE TENT DOOR TO TAKE IN THE SITUATION WAS MORE THAN THE WORK OF A MOMENT
2843-152918-0030 THE SUN SHOWED AS YET LIKE A PAT OF BUTTER AND HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN DISPERSING THE THICK MISTS THE WIND HAD DROPPED SOMEWHAT BUT WAS STILL FAIRLY STRONG THIS IS AFTER ALL THE WORST PART OF ONE'S JOB
2843-152918-0031 TURNING OUT OF ONE'S GOOD WARM SLEEPING BAG AND STANDING OUTSIDE FOR SOME TIME IN THIN CLOTHES WATCHING THE WEATHER WE KNEW BY EXPERIENCE THAT A GLEAM LIKE THIS A CLEARING IN THE WEATHER MIGHT COME SUDDENLY AND THEN ONE HAD TO BE ON THE SPOT
2843-152918-0032 THE GLEAM CAME IT DID NOT LAST LONG BUT LONG ENOUGH WE LAY ON THE SIDE OF A RIDGE THAT FELL AWAY PRETTY STEEPLY THE DESCENT ON THE SOUTH WAS TOO ABRUPT BUT ON THE SOUTH EAST IT WAS BETTER AND MORE GRADUAL
2843-152918-0033 AND ENDED IN A WIDE LEVEL TRACT WE COULD SEE NO CREVASSES OR UNPLEASANTNESS OF ANY KIND IT WAS NOT VERY FAR THAT WE COULD SEE THOUGH ONLY OUR NEAREST SURROUNDINGS OF THE MOUNTAINS WE SAW NOTHING
2843-152918-0034 HAD NOW BROKEN LOOSE AGAIN AND THE NORTH EASTER WAS DOING ALL IT COULD
2843-152918-0035 SINCE WE HAD DISCOVERED THE NATURE OF OUR IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS IF WE ONCE GOT DOWN TO THE PLAIN WE KNEW THAT WE COULD ALWAYS FEEL OUR WAY ON AFTER PUTTING AMPLE BRAKES ON THE SLEDGE RUNNERS
2843-152918-0036 WE STARTED OFF DOWNHILL IN A SOUTH EASTERLY DIRECTION THE SLIGHT IDEA OF THE POSITION THAT WE HAD BEEN ABLE TO GET IN THE MORNING PROVED CORRECT THE DESCENT WAS EASY AND SMOOTH AND WE REACHED THE PLAIN WITHOUT ANY ADVENTURE
2843-152918-0037 WE COULD NOW ONCE MORE SET OUR FACES TO THE SOUTH AND IN THICK DRIVING SNOW WE CONTINUED OUR WAY INTO THE UNKNOWN WITH GOOD ASSISTANCE FROM THE HOWLING NORTH EASTERLY GALE WE NOW RECOMMENCED THE ERECTION OF BEACONS
2843-152918-0038 WHICH HAD NOT BEEN NECESSARY DURING THE ASCENT
2843-152918-0039 THE LAST OF THEM THAT WE ENCOUNTERED THE SURFACE WAS NOW FINE ENOUGH SMOOTH AS A FLOOR AND WITHOUT A SIGN OF SASTRUGI IF OUR PROGRESS WAS NEVERTHELESS SLOW AND DIFFICULT THIS WAS DUE TO THE WRETCHED GOING
2843-152918-0040 WHICH WAS REAL TORTURE TO ALL OF US A SLEDGE JOURNEY THROUGH THE SAHARA COULD NOT HAVE OFFERED A WORSE SURFACE TO MOVE OVER
2843-152918-0041 THE WEATHER IMPROVED IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY AND WHEN WE CAMPED IN THE AFTERNOON IT LOOKED QUITE SMILING THE SUN CAME THROUGH AND GAVE A DELIGHTFUL WARMTH AFTER THE LAST FEW BITTER DAYS IT WAS NOT YET CLEAR
2843-152918-0042 SO THAT WE COULD SEE NOTHING OF OUR SURROUNDINGS THE DISTANCE ACCORDING TO OUR THREE SLEDGE METERS WAS EIGHTEEN AND A HALF MILES TAKING THE BAD GOING INTO CONSIDERATION WE HAD REASON TO BE WELL SATISFIED WITH IT
2843-152918-0043 OUR ALTITUDE CAME OUT AT NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE FEET ABOVE THE SEA OR A DROP OF EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE FEET IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY THIS SURPRISED ME GREATLY WHAT DID IT MEAN
2843-152918-0044 INSTEAD OF RISING GRADUALLY WE WERE GOING SLOWLY DOWN
2843-152918-0045 BUT WHAT ACCORDING TO DEAD RECKONING OUR LATITUDE THAT EVENING
2843-152918-0046 THE NIGHT WAS FILLED WITH SHARP GUSTS FROM THE NORTH THE MORNING CAME WITH A SLACK WIND BUT ACCOMPANIED BY MIST AND SNOWFALL THIS WAS ABOMINABLE HERE WE WERE ADVANCING OVER ABSOLUTELY VIRGIN GROUND AND ABLE TO SEE NOTHING
2843-152918-0047 THE SURFACE REMAINED ABOUT THE SAME POSSIBLY RATHER MORE UNDULATING THAT IT HAD BEEN BLOWING HERE AT SOME TIME AND VIOLENTLY TOO WAS SHOWN BY THE UNDER SURFACE WHICH WAS COMPOSED OF SASTRUGI AS HARD AS IRON
2843-152918-0048 LUCKILY FOR US THE SNOWFALL OF THE LAST FEW DAYS HAD FILLED THESE UP SO AS TO PRESENT A LEVEL SURFACE IT WAS HEAVY GOING THOUGH BETTER THAN ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AS WE WERE ADVANCING STILL BLINDLY
2843-152918-0049 AND FRETTING AT THE PERSISTENTLY THICK WEATHER ONE OF US SUDDENLY CALLED OUT HULLO LOOK THERE A WILD DARK SUMMIT ROSE HIGH OUT OF THE MASS OF FOG TO THE EAST SOUTH EAST IT WAS NOT FAR AWAY
2843-152918-0050 ON THE CONTRARY IT SEEMED THREATENINGLY NEAR AND RIGHT OVER US WE STOPPED AND LOOKED AT THE IMPOSING SIGHT BUT NATURE DID NOT EXPOSE HER OBJECTS OF INTEREST FOR LONG THE FOG ROLLED OVER AGAIN THICK HEAVY AND DARK
2843-152918-0051 AND BLOTTED OUT THE VIEW WE KNEW NOW THAT WE HAD TO BE PREPARED FOR SURPRISES AFTER WE HAD GONE ABOUT TEN MILES THE FOG AGAIN LIFTED FOR A MOMENT AND WE SAW QUITE NEAR A MILE OR SO AWAY
2843-152918-0052 TWO LONG NARROW MOUNTAIN RIDGES TO THE WEST OF US RUNNING NORTH AND SOUTH AND COMPLETELY COVERED WITH SNOW THESE
2843-152918-0053 THEY WERE BETWEEN NINE THOUSAND AND TEN THOUSAND FEET HIGH AND WOULD PROBABLY SERVE AS EXCELLENT LANDMARKS ON THE RETURN JOURNEY THERE WAS NO CONNECTION TO BE TRACED BETWEEN THESE MOUNTAINS AND THOSE LYING TO THE EAST OF THEM
2843-152918-0054 THEY GAVE US THE IMPRESSION OF BEING ENTIRELY ISOLATED SUMMITS AS WE COULD NOT MAKE OUT ANY LOFTY RIDGE RUNNING EAST AND WEST
2843-152918-0055 WE CONTINUED OUR COURSE IN THE CONSTANT EXPECTATION OF FINDING SOME SURPRISE OR OTHER IN OUR LINE OF ROUTE THE AIR AHEAD OF US WAS AS BLACK AS PITCH AS THOUGH IT CONCEALED SOMETHING
2843-152918-0056 IT COULD NOT BE A STORM OR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALREADY UPON US BUT WE WENT ON AND ON AND NOTHING CAME OUR DAY'S MARCH WAS EIGHTEEN AND A HALF MILES I SEE THAT MY DIARY FOR NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH
2843-152918-0057 DOES NOT BEGIN VERY PROMISINGLY FOG FOG AND AGAIN FOG ALSO FINE FALLING SNOW WHICH MAKES THE GOING IMPOSSIBLE POOR BEASTS THEY HAVE TOILED HARD TO GET THE SLEDGES FORWARD TO DAY
2843-152918-0058 BUT THE DAY DID NOT TURN OUT SO BADLY AFTER ALL AS WE WORKED OUR WAY OUT OF THIS UNCERTAINTY AND FOUND OUT WHAT WAS BEHIND THE PITCH DARK CLOUDS DURING THE FORENOON THE SUN CAME THROUGH AND THRUST ASIDE THE FOG FOR A WHILE AND THERE
2843-152918-0059 TO THE SOUTH EAST NOT MANY MILES AWAY LAY AN IMMENSE MOUNTAIN MASS FROM THIS MASS RIGHT ACROSS OUR COURSE RAN A GREAT ANCIENT GLACIER THE SUN SHONE DOWN UPON IT AND SHOWED US A SURFACE FULL OF HUGE IRREGULARITIES
2843-152918-0060 ON THE SIDE NEAREST TO THE MOUNTAIN THESE DISTURBANCES WERE SUCH THAT A HASTY GLANCE WAS ENOUGH TO SHOW US THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ADVANCING THAT WAY BUT RIGHT IN OUR LINE OF ROUTE STRAIGHT ON TO THE GLACIER
2843-152918-0061 AND WAITED FOR DECENTLY CLEAR WEATHER SO THAT WE MIGHT SURVEY THE GROUND AT OUR EASE AND CHOOSE THE BEST WAY GOING FORWARD WITHOUT AN IDEA OF WHAT THE GROUND WAS LIKE WAS NOT VERY PLEASANT
2843-152918-0062 BUT HOW LONG SHOULD WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR CLEAR WEATHER THAT QUESTION WAS UNANSWERABLE POSSIBLY A WEEK OR EVEN A FORTNIGHT AND WE HAD NO TIME FOR THAT BETTER GO STRAIGHT ON THEN AND TAKE WHAT MIGHT COME
2843-152918-0063 WHAT WE COULD SEE OF THE GLACIER APPEARED TO BE PRETTY STEEP BUT IT WAS ONLY BETWEEN THE SOUTH AND SOUTH EAST UNDER THE NEW LAND THAT THE FOG NOW AND AGAIN LIFTED SUFFICIENTLY TO ENABLE US TO SEE ANYTHING
2843-152918-0064 WE COULD SEE THAT THE BIG CREVASSES LOST THEMSELVES IN IT AND THE QUESTION OF WHAT THE GLACIER LOOKED LIKE ON THE WEST
2843-152918-0065 IT WAS PLAIN ENOUGH THAT WE SHOULD HAVE STIFF WORK IT WAS THEREFORE IMPORTANT TO HAVE AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE ON THE SLEDGES WE SET TO WORK AT ONCE TO BUILD THE DEPOT THE SNOW HERE WAS EXCELLENT FOR THIS PURPOSE
2843-152918-0066 AS HARD AS GLASS IN A SHORT TIME AN IMMENSE ERECTION OF ADAMANTINE BLOCKS OF SNOW ROSE INTO THE AIR CONTAINING PROVISIONS FOR FIVE MEN FOR SIX DAYS AND FOR EIGHTEEN DOGS FOR FIVE DAYS
2843-152918-0067 A NUMBER OF SMALL ARTICLES WERE ALSO LEFT BEHIND WHILE WE WERE THUS OCCUPIED THE FOG HAD BEEN COMING AND GOING SOME OF THE INTERVALS HAD BEEN QUITE CLEAR AND HAD GIVEN ME A GOOD VIEW OF THE NEAREST PART OF THE RANGE
2843-152918-0068 IT APPEARED TO BE QUITE ISOLATED AND TO CONSIST OF FOUR MOUNTAINS ONE OF THESE MOUNT HELMER HANSSEN LAY SEPARATED FROM THE REST THE OTHER THREE MOUNTS OSCAR WISTING
2843-152918-0069 AND OLAV BJAALAND LAY CLOSER TOGETHER BEHIND THIS GROUP THE AIR HAD BEEN HEAVY AND BLACK THE WHOLE TIME SHOWING THAT MORE LAND MUST BE CONCEALED THERE SUDDENLY
2843-152918-0070 AND THE SUMMITS OF A COLOSSAL MOUNTAIN MASS APPEARED OUR FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT THIS MOUNTAIN MOUNT THORVALD NILSEN MUST BE SOMETHING OVER TWENTY THOUSAND FEET HIGH IT POSITIVELY TOOK OUR BREATH AWAY
2843-152918-0071 SO FORMIDABLE DID IT APPEAR BUT IT WAS ONLY A GLIMPSE THAT WE HAD AND THEN THE FOG ENCLOSED IT ONCE MORE WE HAD SUCCEEDED IN TAKING A FEW MEAGRE BEARINGS OF THE DIFFERENT SUMMITS OF THE NEAREST GROUP
2843-152918-0072 THEY WERE NOT VERY GRAND BUT BETTER ONES WERE NOT TO BE OBTAINED FOR THAT MATTER THE SITE OF THE DEPOT WAS SO WELL MARKED BY ITS POSITION UNDER THE FOOT OF THE GLACIER THAT WE AGREED IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MISS IT
2843-152918-0073 HAVING FINISHED THE EDIFICE WHICH ROSE AT LEAST SIX FEET INTO THE AIR
2843-152918-0074 SO AS TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT STILL MORE EASILY ON THE WAY BACK AN OBSERVATION WE HAD CONTRIVED TO TAKE WHILE THE WORK WAS IN PROGRESS
2843-152918-0075 THIS DID NOT AGREE VERY WELL WITH THE LATITUDE OF OUR DEAD RECKONING
2843-152918-0076 AND A FINE LIGHT SNOW WAS FALLING WE HAD TAKEN A BEARING OF THE LINE OF GLACIER THAT WAS MOST FREE OF CREVASSES AND SO WE MOVED ON AGAIN
2843-152918-0077 THE CREVASSES AT ITS FOOT WERE NOT LARGE BUT WE HAD NO SOONER ENTERED UPON THE ASCENT THAN THE FUN BEGAN THERE WAS SOMETHING UNCANNY ABOUT THIS PERFECTLY BLIND ADVANCE AMONG CREVASSES AND CHASMS ON ALL SIDES
2843-152918-0078 WE EXAMINED THE COMPASS FROM TIME TO TIME AND WENT FORWARD CAUTIOUSLY
2843-152918-0079 BUT THAT AFTER ALL WAS NOT MUCH OF A HELP TO OUR DRIVERS
2843-152918-0080 AS THE CREVASSES WERE OFTEN RENDERED QUITE INVISIBLE BY A THIN OVERLYING LAYER OF SNOW
2843-152918-0081 TO HAVE TO CROSS SUCH A SURFACE AS THE EFFECT OF LIGHT AND SHADE IS USUALLY TO SHOW UP THE EDGES OF THESE INSIDIOUS PITFALLS BUT ON A DAY LIKE THIS WHEN EVERYTHING LOOKED ALIKE ONE'S ADVANCE IS DOUBTFUL WE KEPT IT GOING HOWEVER
2843-152918-0082 BY USING THE UTMOST CAUTION WISTING CAME NEAR TO SOUNDING THE DEPTH OF ONE OF THESE DANGEROUS CREVASSES WITH SLEDGE DOGS AND ALL AS THE BRIDGE HE WAS ABOUT TO CROSS GAVE WAY THANKS TO HIS PRESENCE OF MIND
2843-152918-0083 AND A LIGHTNING LIKE MOVEMENT SOME WOULD CALL IT LUCK HE MANAGED TO SAVE HIMSELF IN THIS WAY WE WORKED UP ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FEET BUT THEN WE CAME UPON SUCH A LABYRINTH OF YAWNING CHASMS AND OPEN ABYSSES
2843-152918-0084 THAT WE COULD NOT MOVE THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT TO FIND THE LEAST DISTURBED SPOT AND SET THE TENT THERE AS SOON AS THIS WAS DONE HANSSEN AND I SET OUT TO EXPLORE WE WERE ROPED AND THEREFORE SAFE ENOUGH
2843-152918-0085 IT REQUIRED SOME STUDY TO FIND A WAY OUT OF THE TRAP WE HAD RUN OURSELVES INTO TOWARDS THE GROUP OF MOUNTAINS LAST DESCRIBED WHICH NOW LAY TO THE EAST OF US
2843-152918-0086 IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND EVOKED A PICTURE OF VIOLENT CONFUSION THANK GOD WE WERE NOT HERE WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON I THOUGHT TO MYSELF AS I STOOD LOOKING OUT OVER THIS BATTLEFIELD IT MUST HAVE BEEN A SPECTACLE LIKE DOOMSDAY
2843-152918-0087 AND NOT ON A SMALL SCALE EITHER TO ADVANCE IN THAT DIRECTION THEN WAS HOPELESS BUT THAT WAS NO GREAT MATTER SINCE OUR WAY WAS TO THE SOUTH ON THE SOUTH WE COULD SEE NOTHING THE FOG LAY THICK AND HEAVY THERE
2843-152918-0088 THIS RIDGE LED US ON TO AN ICEWAVE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE FEET HIGH A FORMATION WHICH WAS DUE TO THE PRESSURE HAVING CEASED BEFORE THE WAVE HAD BEEN FORCED TO BREAK AND FORM HUMMOCKS
2843-152918-0089 WE SAW WELL ENOUGH THAT THIS WOULD BE A DIFFICULT PLACE TO PASS WITH SLEDGES AND DOGS BUT IN DEFAULT OF ANYTHING BETTER IT WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE FROM THE TOP OF THIS WAVE FORMATION WE COULD SEE DOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE
2843-152918-0090 WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN HIDDEN FROM US THE FOG PREVENTED OUR SEEING FAR BUT THE IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS WERE ENOUGH TO CONVINCE US THAT WITH CAUTION WE COULD BEAT UP FARTHER FROM THE HEIGHT ON WHICH WE STOOD
2843-152918-0091 AS WE SAW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OUR OBJECT WAS TO MAKE TRACKS FOR THE FOLLOWING DAY'S JOURNEY THE LANGUAGE WE USED ABOUT THE GLACIER AS WE WENT WAS NOT ALTOGETHER COMPLIMENTARY WE HAD ENDLESS TACKING AND TURNING TO GET ON
2843-152918-0092 A FISSURE HAD OPENED MAKING A GATEWAY ABOUT SIX FEET WIDE THIS FORMATION LIKE EVERY THING ELSE ON THE GLACIER WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY OLD AND FOR THE MOST PART FILLED WITH SNOW
2843-152918-0093 FROM THIS POINT THE GLACIER AS FAR AS OUR VIEW EXTENDED TO THE SOUTH LOOKED BETTER AND BETTER
2843-152918-0094 OUR COMPANIONS WERE NO LESS PLEASED WITH THE NEWS WE BROUGHT OF OUR PROSPECTS OUR ALTITUDE THAT EVENING WAS EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY FEET ABOVE THE SEA THAT IS TO SAY AT THE FOOT OF THE GLACIER
2843-152918-0095 WE HAD REACHED AN ALTITUDE OF EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FEET OR A DROP FROM THE BUTCHER'S OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FEET WE NOW KNEW VERY WELL THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THIS ASCENT TO MAKE AGAIN PERHAPS EVEN MORE
2843-152918-0096 AND THIS IDEA DID NOT AROUSE ANY PARTICULAR ENTHUSIASM IN MY DIARY I SEE THAT I CONCLUDE THE DAY WITH THE FOLLOWING WORDS WHAT WILL THE NEXT SURPRISE BE I WONDER IT WAS IN FACT
2843-152918-0097 AN EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY THAT WE WERE UNDERTAKING THROUGH NEW REGIONS NEW MOUNTAINS GLACIERS AND SO ON WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SEE
2843-152918-0098 WHAT I LIKED LEAST ABOUT THIS FEELING ONE'S WAY FORWARD IN THE DARK WAS THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT VERY DIFFICULT INDEED TO RECOGNIZE THE GROUND AGAIN ON THE WAY BACK BUT WITH THIS GLACIER LYING STRAIGHT ACROSS OUR LINE OF ROUTE
2843-152918-0099 A MISTAKE THERE MIGHT BE SERIOUS ENOUGH AND IT WILL APPEAR LATER IN THIS NARRATIVE THAT MY FEAR OF OUR NOT BEING ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THE WAY WAS NOT ENTIRELY GROUNDLESS THE BEACONS WE HAD PUT UP CAME TO OUR AID
2843-152918-0100 AND FOR OUR FINAL SUCCESS WE OWE A DEEP DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO OUR PRUDENCE AND THOUGHTFULNESS IN ADOPTING THIS EXPEDIENT NEXT MORNING NOVEMBER TWENTY NINTH BROUGHT CONSIDERABLY CLEARER WEATHER
2843-152918-0101 AND ALLOWED US A VERY GOOD SURVEY OF OUR POSITION WE COULD NOW SEE THAT THE TWO MOUNTAIN RANGES
2843-152918-0102 WITH SUMMITS FROM TEN THOUSAND TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND FEET MOUNT THORVALD NILSEN WAS THE MOST SOUTHERLY WE COULD SEE FROM THIS POINT MOUNTS HANSSEN WISTING BJAALAND AND HASSEL FORMED AS WE HAD THOUGHT THE DAY BEFORE
2843-152918-0103 A GROUP BY THEMSELVES AND LAY SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN RANGE THE DRIVERS HAD A WARM MORNING'S WORK THEY HAD TO DRIVE WITH GREAT CIRCUMSPECTION AND PATIENCE TO GRAPPLE WITH THE KIND OF GROUND WE HAD BEFORE US
2843-152918-0104 A SLIGHT MISTAKE MIGHT BE ENOUGH TO SEND BOTH SLEDGE AND DOGS WITH LIGHTNING RAPIDITY INTO THE NEXT WORLD IT TOOK NEVERTHELESS A REMARKABLY SHORT TIME TO COVER THE DISTANCE WE HAD EXPLORED ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING BEFORE WE KNEW IT
2843-152918-0105 WE WERE AT HELL'S GATE BJAALAND TOOK AN EXCELLENT PHOTOGRAPH HERE WHICH GIVES A VERY GOOD IDEA OF THE DIFFICULTIES THIS PART OF THE JOURNEY PRESENTED IN THE FOREGROUND
2843-152918-0106 BELOW THE HIGH SNOW RIDGE THAT FORMS ONE SIDE OF A VERY WIDE BUT PARTLY FILLED UP CREVASSE THE MARKS OF SKI CAN BE SEEN IN THE SNOW THIS WAS THE PHOTOGRAPHER WHO IN PASSING OVER THIS SNOW BRIDGE
2843-152918-0107 STRUCK HIS SKI INTO IT TO TRY THE STRENGTH OF THE SUPPORT CLOSE TO THE TRACKS CAN BE SEEN AN OPEN PIECE OF THE CREVASSE IT IS A PALE BLUE AT THE TOP BUT ENDS IN THE DEEPEST BLACK IN A BOTTOMLESS ABYSS
2843-152918-0108 THE PHOTOGRAPHER GOT OVER THE BRIDGE AND BACK WITH A WHOLE SKIN BUT THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION OF RISKING SLEDGES AND DOGS ON IT AND IT CAN BE SEEN IN THE PHOTOGRAPH THAT THE SLEDGES HAVE BEEN TURNED RIGHT ROUND TO TRY ANOTHER WAY
2843-152918-0109 BUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE TURNS AND CIRCUITS WE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO MAKE IT WAS NOT SO SHORT AFTER ALL WE SET OUR TENT ON A GOOD SOLID FOUNDATION AND WERE WELL PLEASED WITH THE DAY'S WORK
2843-152918-0110 THE ALTITUDE WAS EIGHT THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED SIXTY FEET ABOVE THE SEA THE SUN WAS NOW IN THE WEST AND SHINING DIRECTLY UPON THE HUGE MOUNTAIN MASSES IT WAS A FAIRY LANDSCAPE IN BLUE AND WHITE
2843-152918-0111 CLEAR AS IT NOW APPEARED TO BE ONE COULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE WEATHER WAS NOT ALL THAT COULD BE WISHED FOR THE SOUTH EASTERN END OF MOUNT THORVALD NILSEN LOST ITSELF IN A DARK IMPENETRABLE CLOUD
2843-152918-0112 WHICH LED ONE TO SUSPECT A CONTINUATION IN THAT DIRECTION THOUGH ONE COULD NOT BE CERTAIN MOUNT NILSEN AH ANYTHING MORE BEAUTIFUL TAKING IT ALTOGETHER I HAVE NEVER SEEN
2843-152918-0113 PEAKS OF THE MOST VARIED FORMS ROSE HIGH INTO THE AIR PARTLY COVERED WITH DRIVING CLOUDS SOME WERE SHARP BUT MOST WERE LONG AND ROUNDED HERE AND THERE ONE SAW BRIGHT SHINING GLACIERS
2843-152918-0114 PLUNGING WILDLY DOWN THE STEEP SIDES AND MERGING INTO THE UNDERLYING GROUND IN FEARFUL CONFUSION BUT THE MOST REMARKABLE OF THEM ALL WAS MOUNT HELMER HANSSEN ITS TOP WAS AS ROUND AS THE BOTTOM OF A BOWL
2843-152918-0115 AND COVERED BY AN EXTRAORDINARY ICE SHEET WHICH WAS SO BROKEN UP AND DISTURBED THAT THE BLOCKS OF ICE BRISTLED IN EVERY DIRECTION LIKE THE QUILLS OF A PORCUPINE IT GLITTERED AND BURNED IN THE SUNLIGHT A GLORIOUS SPECTACLE
289-121652-0000 NONE OF US WHETHER CHILDREN OR ADULTS NEEDS AN INTRODUCTION TO MOTHER GOOSE THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE EARLIEST IMPRESSED UPON OUR MINDS CLING TO THEM MOST TENACIOUSLY THE SNATCHES SUNG IN THE NURSERY ARE NEVER FORGOTTEN
289-121652-0001 NOR ARE THEY EVER RECALLED WITHOUT BRINGING BACK WITH THEM MYRIADS OF SLUMBERING FEELINGS AND HALF FORGOTTEN IMAGES WE HEAR THE SWEET LOW VOICE OF THE MOTHER SINGING SOFT LULLABIES TO HER DARLING
289-121652-0002 AND SEE THE KINDLY WRINKLED FACE OF THE GRANDMOTHER AS SHE CROONS THE OLD DITTIES TO QUIET OUR RESTLESS SPIRITS ONE GENERATION IS LINKED TO ANOTHER BY THE EVERLASTING SPIRIT OF SONG
289-121652-0003 THE BALLADS OF THE NURSERY FOLLOW US FROM CHILDHOOD TO OLD AGE AND THEY ARE READILY BROUGHT FROM MEMORY'S RECESSES AT ANY TIME TO AMUSE OUR CHILDREN OR OUR GRANDCHILDREN THE COLLECTION OF JINGLES WE KNOW AND LOVE AS THE MELODIES OF MOTHER GOOSE
289-121652-0004 ARE EVIDENTLY DRAWN FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES WHILE THEY ARE TAKEN ALTOGETHER A HAPPY UNION OF RHYME WIT
289-121652-0005 THE RESEARCH AFTER THE AUTHOR OF EACH INDIVIDUAL VERSE WOULD INDEED BE HOPELESS IT WOULD BE FOLLY TO SUPPOSE THEM ALL THE COMPOSITION OF UNEDUCATED OLD NURSES FOR MANY OF THEM CONTAIN MUCH REFLECTION WIT AND MELODY
289-121652-0006 IT IS SAID THAT SHELLEY WROTE PUSSY CAT MEW AND DEAN SWIFT LITTLE BO PEEP AND THESE ASSERTIONS ARE AS DIFFICULT TO DISPROVE AS TO PROVE SOME OF THE OLDER VERSES HOWEVER
289-121652-0007 ARE DOUBTLESS OFFSHOOTS FROM ANCIENT FOLK LORE SONGS AND HAVE DESCENDED TO US THROUGH MANY CENTURIES THE CONNECTION OF MOTHER GOOSE WITH THE RHYMES WHICH BEAR HER NAME IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE AND IN FACT THREE COUNTRIES CLAIM HER FOR THEIR OWN
289-121652-0008 FRANCE ENGLAND AND AMERICA ABOUT THE YEAR SIXTEEN FIFTY THERE APPEARED IN CIRCULATION IN LONDON A SMALL BOOK NAMED RHYMES OF THE NURSERY OR LULLA BYES FOR CHILDREN
289-121652-0009 WHICH CONTAINED MANY OF THE IDENTICAL PIECES THAT HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN TO US BUT THE NAME OF MOTHER GOOSE WAS EVIDENTLY NOT THEN KNOWN IN THIS EDITION WERE THE RHYMES OF LITTLE JACK HOMER OLD KING COLE MISTRESS MARY SING A SONG O SIXPENCE
289-121652-0010 AND LITTLE BOY BLUE IN SIXTEEN NINETY SEVEN CHARLES PERRAULT PUBLISHED IN FRANCE
289-121652-0011 ALTHOUGH PERRAULT'S TALES DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE WE NOW KNOW UNDER THIS TITLE THEY COMPRISED THE SLEEPING BEAUTY THE FAIRY LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD BLUE BEARD PUSS IN BOOTS
289-121652-0012 RIQUET WITH THE TUFT CINDERELLA AND LITTLE THUMB EIGHT STORIES IN ALL ON THE COVER OF THE BOOK WAS DEPICTED AN OLD LADY HOLDING IN HER HAND A DISTAFF
289-121652-0013 AMERICA BASES HER CLAIM TO MOTHER GOOSE UPON THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT MADE BY THE LATE JOHN FLEET ELIOT A DESCENDANT OF THOMAS FLEET THE PRINTER AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THERE LIVED IN BOSTON A LADY NAMED ELIZA GOOSE
289-121652-0014 WRITTEN ALSO VERGOOSE AND VERTIGOOSE WHO BELONGED TO A WEALTHY FAMILY HER ELDEST DAUGHTER ELIZABETH GOOSE OR VERTIGOOSE
289-121652-0015 AND IN DUE TIME GAVE BIRTH TO A SON LIKE MOST MOTHERS IN LAW IN OUR DAY THE IMPORTANCE OF MISSUS GOOSE INCREASED WITH THE APPEARANCE OF HER GRANDCHILD AND POOR MISTER FLEET HALF DISTRACTED WITH HER ENDLESS NURSERY DITTIES FINDING ALL OTHER MEANS FAIL
289-121652-0016 TRIED WHAT RIDICULE COULD EFFECT AND ACTUALLY PRINTED A BOOK UNDER THE TITLE SONGS OF THE NURSERY OR MOTHER GOOSE'S MELODIES FOR CHILDREN ON THE TITLE PAGE WAS THE PICTURE OF A GOOSE WITH A VERY LONG NECK AND A MOUTH WIDE OPEN AND BELOW THIS
289-121652-0017 PRINTED BY T FLEET AT HIS PRINTING HOUSE IN PUDDING LANE SEVENTEEN NINETEEN PRICE TWO COPPERS MISTER WM A WHEELER THE EDITOR OF HURD AND HOUGHTON'S ELABORATE EDITION OF MOTHER GOOSE EIGHTEEN SEVENTY REITERATED THIS ASSERTION
289-121652-0018 AND A WRITER IN THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT OF JUNE SEVENTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR SAYS FLEET'S BOOK WAS PARTLY A REPRINT OF AN ENGLISH COLLECTION OF SONGS BARCLAY'S AND THE NEW TITLE WAS DOUBTLESS A COMPLIMENT BY THE PRINTER TO HIS MOTHER IN LAW GOOSE FOR HER CONTRIBUTIONS
289-121652-0019 SHE WAS THE MOTHER OF SIXTEEN CHILDREN AND A TYPICAL OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE WE MAY TAKE IT TO BE TRUE THAT FLEET'S WIFE WAS OF THE VERGOOSE FAMILY AND THAT THE NAME WAS OFTEN CONTRACTED TO GOOSE
289-121652-0020 BUT THE REST OF THE STORY IS UNSUPPORTED BY ANY EVIDENCE WHATEVER IN FACT ALL THAT MISTER ELIOT KNEW OF IT WAS THE STATEMENT OF THE LATE EDWARD A CROWNINSHIELD OF BOSTON THAT HE HAD SEEN FLEET'S EDITION IN THE LIBRARY OF THE AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY
289-121652-0021 REPEATED RESEARCHES AT WORCESTER HAVING FAILED TO BRING TO LIGHT THIS SUPPOSED COPY AND NO RECORD OF IT APPEARING ON ANY CATALOGUE THERE WE MAY DISMISS THE ENTIRE STORY WITH THE SUPPOSITION THAT MISTER ELIOT MISUNDERSTOOD THE REMARKS MADE TO HIM
289-121652-0022 INDEED AS MISTER WILLIAM H WHITMORE POINTS OUT IN HIS CLEVER MONOGRAPH UPON MOTHER GOOSE ALBANY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE IT IS VERY DOUBTFUL WHETHER IN SEVENTEEN NINETEEN
289-121652-0023 BOSTON CHILDREN AT THAT DATE SAYS MISTER WHITMORE WERE FED UPON GOSPEL FOOD AND IT SEEMS EXTREMELY IMPROBABLE THAT AN EDITION COULD HAVE BEEN SOLD
289-121652-0024 IS OF ABOUT THE SAME DATE AS BOSTON'S THERE LIVED IN A TOWN IN SUSSEX ABOUT THE YEAR SEVENTEEN O FOUR AN OLD WOMAN NAMED MARTHA GOOCH SHE WAS A CAPITAL NURSE AND IN GREAT DEMAND TO CARE FOR NEWLY BORN BABIES THEREFORE
289-121652-0025 THROUGH LONG YEARS OF SERVICE AS NURSE SHE CAME TO BE CALLED MOTHER GOOCH THIS GOOD WOMAN HAD ONE PECULIARITY SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO CROON QUEER RHYMES AND JINGLES OVER THE CRADLES OF HER CHARGES AND THESE RHYMES
289-121652-0026 SEEMED SO SENSELESS AND SILLY TO THE PEOPLE WHO OVERHEARD THEM THAT THEY BEGAN TO CALL HER MOTHER GOOSE IN DERISION THE TERM BEING DERIVED FROM QUEEN GOOSEFOOT THE MOTHER OF CHARLEMAGNE THE OLD NURSE PAID NO ATTENTION TO HER CRITICS
289-121652-0027 BUT CONTINUED TO SING HER RHYMES AS BEFORE FOR HOWEVER MUCH GROWN PEOPLE MIGHT LAUGH AT HER THE CHILDREN SEEMED TO ENJOY THEM VERY MUCH AND NOT ONE OF THEM WAS TOO PEEVISH TO BE QUIETED AND SOOTHED BY HER VERSES
289-121652-0028 AT ONE TIME MISTRESS GOOCH WAS NURSING A CHILD OF MISTER RONALD BARCLAY A PHYSICIAN RESIDING IN THE TOWN AND HE NOTICED THE RHYMES SHE SANG AND BECAME INTERESTED IN THEM IN TIME HE WROTE THEM ALL DOWN AND MADE A BOOK OF THEM
289-121652-0029 WHICH IT IS SAID WAS PRINTED BY JOHN WORTHINGTON AND SON IN THE STRAND LONDON IN SEVENTEEN TWELVE UNDER THE NAME OF YE MELODIOUS RHYMES OF MOTHER GOOSE BUT EVEN THIS STORY OF MARTHA GOOCH
289-121652-0030 IS BASED UPON VERY MEAGER AND UNSATISFACTORY EVIDENCE THE EARLIEST ENGLISH EDITION OF MOTHER GOOSE'S MELODIES THAT IS ABSOLUTELY AUTHENTIC WAS ISSUED BY JOHN NEWBURY OF LONDON ABOUT THE YEAR SEVENTEEN SIXTY AND THE FIRST AUTHENTIC AMERICAN EDITION
289-121652-0031 IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE NONE OF THE EARLIER EDITIONS HOWEVER CONTAINED ALL THE RHYMES SO WELL KNOWN AT THE PRESENT DAY SINCE EVERY DECADE HAS ADDED ITS QUOTA TO THE MASS OF JINGLES ATTRIBUTED TO MOTHER GOOSE
289-121652-0032 SOME OF THE EARLIER VERSES HAVE BECOME ENTIRELY OBSOLETE AND IT IS WELL THEY HAVE FOR MANY WERE CRUDE AND SILLY AND OTHERS WERE COARSE IT IS SIMPLY A RESULT OF THE GREATER REFINEMENT OF MODERN CIVILIZATION
289-121652-0033 THAT THEY HAVE BEEN RELEGATED TO OBLIVION WHILE THE REAL GEMS OF THE COLLECTION WILL DOUBTLESS LIVE AND GROW IN POPULAR FAVOR FOR MANY AGES
289-121652-0034 IT DOES NOT MATTER IN THE LEAST WHETHER SHE WAS IN REALITY A MYTH OR A LIVING ELIZA GOOSE MARTHA GOOCH OR THE MERE OYE OF PERRAULT THE SONGS THAT CLUSTER AROUND HER NAME ARE WHAT WE LOVE
289-121652-0035 AND EACH INDIVIDUAL VERSE APPEALS MORE TO THE CHILDISH MIND THAN DOES MOTHER GOOSE HERSELF MANY OF THESE NURSERY RHYMES ARE COMPLETE TALES IN THEMSELVES TELLING THEIR STORY TERSELY BUT COMPLETELY THERE ARE OTHERS WHICH ARE BUT BARE SUGGESTIONS
289-121652-0036 LEAVING THE IMAGINATION TO WEAVE IN THE DETAILS OF THE STORY PERHAPS THEREIN MAY LIE PART OF THEIR CHARM BUT HOWEVER THAT MAY BE I HAVE THOUGHT THE CHILDREN MIGHT LIKE THE STORIES TOLD AT GREATER LENGTH THAT THEY MAY DWELL THE LONGER UPON THEIR FAVORITE HEROES AND HEROINES
289-121652-0037 FOR THAT REASON I HAVE WRITTEN THIS BOOK IN MAKING THE STORIES I HAVE FOLLOWED MAINLY THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE RHYMES AND MY HOPE IS THAT THE LITTLE ONES WILL LIKE THEM AND NOT FIND THAT THEY INTERFERE WITH THE FANCIFUL CREATIONS OF THEIR OWN IMAGINATIONS
289-121652-0038 L FRANK BAUM CHICAGO ILLINOIS
289-121665-0000 AND ONE OF THESE FLOCKS USED TO BE CARED FOR BY A POOR WOMAN WHO SUPPORTED HERSELF AND HER LITTLE GIRL BY THIS MEANS THEY LIVED IN A SMALL COTTAGE NESTLED AT THE FOOT OF ONE OF THE HILLS AND EACH MORNING THE MOTHER TOOK HER CROOK
289-121665-0001 AND STARTED OUT WITH HER SHEEP THAT THEY MIGHT FEED UPON THE TENDER JUICY GRASSES WITH WHICH THE HILLS ABOUNDED THE LITTLE GIRL USUALLY ACCOMPANIED HER MOTHER AND SAT BY HER SIDE
289-121665-0002 UPON THE GRASSY MOUNDS AND WATCHED HER CARE FOR THE EWES AND LAMBS SO THAT IN TIME SHE HERSELF GREW TO BE A VERY PROFICIENT SHEPHERDESS SO WHEN THE MOTHER BECAME TOO OLD AND FEEBLE TO LEAVE HER COTTAGE LITTLE BO PEEP AS SHE WAS CALLED
289-121665-0003 DECIDED THAT SHE WAS FULLY ABLE TO MANAGE THE FLOCKS HERSELF SHE WAS A LITTLE MITE OF A CHILD WITH FLOWING NUT BROWN LOCKS AND BIG GRAY EYES THAT CHARMED ALL WHO GAZED INTO THEIR INNOCENT DEPTHS SHE WORE A LIGHT GRAY FROCK
289-121665-0004 FASTENED ABOUT THE WAIST WITH A PRETTY PINK SASH AND THERE WERE WHITE RUFFLES AROUND HER NECK AND PINK RIBBONS IN HER HAIR ALL THE SHEPHERDS AND SHEPHERDESSES UPON THE HILLS BOTH YOUNG AND OLD SOON CAME TO KNOW LITTLE BO PEEP VERY WELL INDEED
289-121665-0005 AND THERE WERE MANY WILLING HANDS TO AID HER IF WHICH WAS NOT OFTEN SHE NEEDED THEIR ASSISTANCE BO PEEP USUALLY TOOK HER SHEEP TO THE SIDE OF A HIGH HILL ABOVE THE COTTAGE AND ALLOWED THEM TO EAT THE RICH GRASS WHILE SHE HERSELF SAT UPON A MOUND AND
289-121665-0006 LAYING ASIDE HER CROOK AND HER BROAD STRAW HAT WITH ITS PINK RIBBONS DEVOTED HER TIME TO SEWING AND MENDING STOCKINGS FOR HER AGED MOTHER ONE DAY WHILE THUS OCCUPIED
289-121665-0007 GOOD MORNING LITTLE BO PEEP AND LOOKING UP THE GIRL SAW A WOMAN STANDING NEAR HER AND LEANING UPON A SHORT STICK SHE WAS BENT NEARLY DOUBLE BY WEIGHT OF MANY YEARS HER HAIR WAS WHITE AS SNOW AND HER EYES AS BLACK AS COALS

289-121665-0021 VERY SOON I SHALL SEE THE SHEEP COMING BACK BUT TIME PASSED AWAY AND STILL THE ERRANT FLOCK FAILED TO MAKE ITS APPEARANCE SOON THE HEAD OF THE LITTLE SHEPHERDESS BEGAN TO NOD
289-121665-0022 LITTLE BO PEEP FELL FAST ASLEEP AND DREAMT SHE HEARD THEM BLEATING BUT WHEN SHE AWOKE SHE FOUND IT A JOKE FOR STILL THEY WERE A FLEETING THE GIRL NOW BECAME QUITE ANXIOUS AND WONDERED WHY THE OLD WOMAN HAD NOT DRIVEN HER FLOCK OVER THE HILL
289-121665-0023 BUT AS IT WAS NOW TIME FOR LUNCHEON SHE OPENED HER LITTLE BASKET AND ATE OF THE BREAD AND CHEESE AND COOKIES SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER AFTER SHE HAD FINISHED HER MEAL AND TAKEN A DRINK OF COOL WATER FROM A SPRING NEAR BY
289-121665-0024 SHE DECIDED SHE WOULD NOT WAIT ANY LONGER SO UP SHE TOOK HER LITTLE CROOK DETERMINED FOR TO FIND THEM AND BEGAN CLIMBING THE HILL WHEN SHE GOT TO THE TOP THERE WAS NEVER A SIGHT OF SHEEP ABOUT
289-121665-0025 ONLY A GREEN VALLEY AND ANOTHER HILL BEYOND NOW REALLY ALARMED FOR THE SAFETY OF HER CHARGE BO PEEP HURRIED INTO THE VALLEY AND UP THE FARTHER HILL SIDE PANTING AND TIRED SHE REACHED THE SUMMIT AND PAUSING BREATHLESSLY
289-121665-0026 GAZED BELOW HER QUIETLY FEEDING UPON THE RICH GRASS WAS HER TRUANT FLOCK LOOKING AS PEACEFUL AND INNOCENT AS IF IT HAD NEVER STRAYED AWAY FROM ITS GENTLE SHEPHERDESS BO PEEP UTTERED A CRY OF JOY AND HURRIED TOWARD THEM
289-121665-0027 BUT WHEN SHE CAME NEAR SHE STOPPED IN AMAZEMENT AND HELD UP HER LITTLE HANDS WITH A PRETTY EXPRESSION OF DISMAY SHE HAD FOUND THEM INDEED BUT IT MADE HER HEART BLEED
289-121665-0028 NOTHING WAS LEFT TO EACH SHEEP BUT A WEE LITTLE STUMP WHERE A TAIL SHOULD BE AND LITTLE BO PEEP WAS SO HEART BROKEN THAT SHE SAT DOWN BESIDE THEM AND SOBBED BITTERLY
289-121665-0029 BUT AFTER AWHILE THE TINY MAID REALIZED THAT ALL HER TEARS WOULD NOT BRING BACK THE TAILS TO HER LAMBKINS SO SHE PLUCKED UP COURAGE AND DRIED HER EYES AND AROSE FROM THE GROUND JUST AS THE OLD WOMAN HOBBLED UP TO HER
289-121665-0030 SO YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR SHEEP DEARIE SHE SAID IN HER CRACKED VOICE YES REPLIED LITTLE BO PEEP WITH DIFFICULTY REPRESSING A SOB BUT LOOK MOTHER THEY VE ALL LEFT THEIR TAILS BEHIND THEM WHY SO THEY HAVE EXCLAIMED THE OLD WOMAN
289-121665-0031 AND THEN SHE BEGAN TO LAUGH AS IF SOMETHING PLEASED HER WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE HAS BECOME OF THEIR TAILS ASKED THE GIRL OH SOME ONE HAS PROBABLY CUT THEM OFF THEY MAKE NICE TIPPETS IN WINTER TIME YOU KNOW
289-121665-0032 AND THEN SHE PATTED THE CHILD UPON HER HEAD AND WALKED AWAY DOWN THE VALLEY BO PEEP WAS MUCH GRIEVED OVER THE LOSS THAT HAD BEFALLEN HER DEAR SHEEP AND SO DRIVING THEM BEFORE HER SHE WANDERED AROUND TO SEE IF BY ANY CHANCE SHE COULD FIND THE LOST TAILS
289-121665-0033 BUT SOON THE SUN BEGAN TO SINK OVER THE HILL TOPS AND SHE KNEW SHE MUST TAKE HER SHEEP HOME BEFORE NIGHT OVERTOOK THEM SHE DID NOT TELL HER MOTHER OF HER MISFORTUNE FOR SHE FEARED THE OLD SHEPHERDESS WOULD SCOLD HER
289-121665-0034 AND BO PEEP HAD FULLY DECIDED TO SEEK FOR THE TAILS AND FIND THEM BEFORE SHE RELATED THE STORY OF THEIR LOSS TO ANYONE EACH DAY FOR MANY DAYS AFTER THAT LITTLE BO PEEP WANDERED ABOUT THE HILLS SEEKING THE TAILS OF HER SHEEP
289-121665-0035 AND THOSE WHO MET HER WONDERED WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO MAKE THE SWEET LITTLE MAID SO ANXIOUS BUT THERE IS AN END TO ALL TROUBLES NO MATTER HOW SEVERE THEY MAY SEEM TO BE AND IT HAPPENED ONE DAY AS BO PEEP DID STRAY UNTO A MEADOW HARD BY
289-121665-0036 THE LITTLE SHEPHERDESS WAS OVERJOYED AT THIS DISCOVERY AND REACHING UP HER CROOK SHE KNOCKED THE ROW OF PRETTY WHITE TAILS OFF THE TREE AND GATHERED THEM UP IN HER FROCK BUT HOW TO FASTEN THEM ONTO HER SHEEP AGAIN WAS THE QUESTION
289-121665-0037 AND AFTER PONDERING THE MATTER FOR A TIME SHE BECAME DISCOURAGED AND THINKING SHE WAS NO BETTER OFF THAN BEFORE THE TAILS WERE FOUND SHE BEGAN TO WEEP AND TO BEWAIL HER MISFORTUNE BUT AMIDST HER TEARS SHE BETHOUGHT HERSELF OF HER NEEDLE AND THREAD
289-121665-0038 WHY SHE EXCLAIMED SMILING AGAIN I CAN SEW THEM ON OF COURSE THEN SHE HEAVED A SIGH AND WIPED HER EYE AND RAN O'ER HILL AND DALE OH AND TRIED WHAT SHE COULD AS A SHEPHERDESS SHOULD TO TACK TO EACH SHEEP ITS TAIL OH
289-121665-0039 BUT THE VERY FIRST SHEEP SHE CAME TO REFUSED TO ALLOW HER TO SEW ON THE TAIL AND RAN AWAY FROM HER AND THE OTHERS DID THE SAME SO THAT FINALLY SHE WAS UTTERLY DISCOURAGED SHE WAS BEGINNING TO CRY AGAIN WHEN THE SAME OLD WOMAN SHE HAD BEFORE MET
289-121665-0040 CAME HOBBLING TO HER SIDE AND ASKED WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH MY CAT TAILS YOUR CAT TAILS REPLIED BO PEEP IN SURPRISE WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHY THESE TAILS ARE ALL CUT FROM WHITE PUSSYCATS AND I PUT THEM ON THE TREE TO DRY
289-121665-0041 WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THEM I THOUGHT THEY BELONGED TO MY SHEEP ANSWERED BO PEEP SORROWFULLY
289-121665-0042 I MUST HUNT UNTIL I FIND THOSE THAT BELONG TO MY SHEEP MY DEAR SAID THE OLD WOMAN I HAVE BEEN DECEIVING YOU YOU SAID YOU KNEW ALL ABOUT YOUR SHEEP AND I WANTED TO TEACH YOU A LESSON FOR HOWEVER WISE WE MAY BE
289-121665-0043 NO ONE IN THIS WORLD KNOWS ALL ABOUT ANYTHING SHEEP DO NOT HAVE LONG TAILS THERE IS ONLY A LITTLE STUMP TO ANSWER FOR A TAIL NEITHER DO RABBITS HAVE TAILS NOR BEARS NOR MANY OTHER ANIMALS
289-121665-0044 AND IF YOU HAD BEEN OBSERVING YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN ALL THIS WHEN I SAID THE SHEEP WOULD BE WAGGING THEIR TAILS BEHIND THEM AND THEN YOU WOULD NOT HAVE PASSED ALL THOSE DAYS IN SEARCHING FOR WHAT IS NOT TO BE FOUND
289-121665-0045 SO NOW LITTLE ONE RUN AWAY HOME AND TRY TO BE MORE THOUGHTFUL IN THE FUTURE YOUR SHEEP WILL NEVER MISS THE TAILS
289-121665-0046 AND NOW LITTLE BO PEEP NO MORE DID WEEP MY TALE OF TAILS ENDS HERE
2893-139310-0000 THE PEOPLE MARCH HE BECAME AWARE OF SOMEONE URGING A GLASS OF CLEAR FLUID UPON HIS ATTENTION LOOKED UP AND DISCOVERED THIS WAS A DARK YOUNG MAN IN A YELLOW GARMENT HE TOOK THE DOSE FORTHWITH AND IN A MOMENT HE WAS GLOWING

2893-139310-0029 BUT A MOMENT THAT WAS NEAR TO PANIC PASSED HE TRIED TO MAKE AUDIBLE INQUIRIES OF

2893-139310-0036 HE EMERGED IN THE ALCOVE AGAIN INCONTINENTLY THE MOUNTING WAVES OF THE SONG BROKE UPON HIS APPEARING AND FLASHED UP INTO A FOAM OF SHOUTING GUIDED BY LINCOLN'S HAND HE MARCHED OBLIQUELY ACROSS THE CENTRE OF THE STAGE FACING THE PEOPLE

2893-139310-0048 TRIBUTARY GANGWAYS FROM THE REMOTE UPLANDS OF THE HALL THRUST DOWNWARD IN AN INCESSANT REPLACEMENT OF PEOPLE TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP THE UNISON OF THE SONG WAS ENRICHED AND COMPLICATED BY THE MASSIVE ECHOES OF ARCHES AND PASSAGES MEN AND WOMEN

2893-139310-0051 THE FLOW OF PEOPLE SMOTE DOWNWARD UNTIL THE UPTURNED FACES WERE BELOW THE LEVEL OF HIS FEET HE WAS AWARE OF A PATH BEFORE HIM OF A SUITE ABOUT HIM OF GUARDS AND DIGNITIES AND LINCOLN ON HIS RIGHT HAND
2893-139310-0052 ATTENDANTS INTERVENED AND EVER AND AGAIN BLOTTED OUT THE SIGHT OF THE MULTITUDE TO THE LEFT BEFORE HIM WENT THE BACKS OF THE GUARDS IN BLACK THREE AND THREE AND THREE HE WAS MARCHED ALONG A LITTLE RAILED WAY AND CROSSED ABOVE THE ARCHWAY
2893-139310-0053 WITH THE TORRENT DIPPING TO FLOW BENEATH AND SHOUTING UP TO HIM HE DID NOT KNOW WHITHER HE WENT HE DID NOT WANT TO KNOW HE GLANCED BACK ACROSS A FLAMING SPACIOUSNESS OF HALL
2893-139322-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE THE UNDER SIDE FROM THE BUSINESS QUARTER THEY PRESENTLY PASSED BY THE RUNNING WAYS INTO A REMOTE QUARTER OF THE CITY WHERE THE BULK OF THE MANUFACTURES WAS DONE
2893-139322-0001 ON THEIR WAY THE PLATFORMS CROSSED THE THAMES TWICE AND PASSED IN A BROAD VIADUCT ACROSS ONE OF THE GREAT ROADS THAT ENTERED THE CITY FROM THE NORTH IN BOTH CASES HIS IMPRESSION WAS SWIFT AND IN BOTH VERY VIVID
2893-139322-0002 THE RIVER WAS A BROAD WRINKLED GLITTER OF BLACK SEA WATER OVERARCHED BY BUILDINGS AND VANISHING EITHER WAY INTO A BLACKNESS STARRED WITH RECEDING LIGHTS A STRING OF BLACK BARGES PASSED SEAWARD MANNED BY BLUE CLAD MEN
2893-139322-0003 THE ROAD WAS A LONG AND VERY BROAD AND HIGH TUNNEL ALONG WHICH BIG WHEELED MACHINES DROVE NOISELESSLY AND SWIFTLY HERE TOO THE DISTINCTIVE BLUE OF THE LABOUR DEPARTMENT WAS IN ABUNDANCE THE SMOOTHNESS OF THE DOUBLE TRACKS
2893-139322-0004 STRUCK GRAHAM MOST VIVIDLY ONE LANK AND VERY HIGH CARRIAGE WITH LONGITUDINAL METALLIC RODS HUNG WITH THE DRIPPING CARCASSES OF MANY HUNDRED SHEEP ARRESTED HIS ATTENTION UNDULY ABRUPTLY THE EDGE OF THE ARCHWAY CUT
2893-139322-0005 AND BLOTTED OUT THE PICTURE PRESENTLY THEY LEFT THE WAY AND DESCENDED BY A LIFT AND TRAVERSED A PASSAGE THAT SLOPED DOWNWARD AND SO CAME TO A DESCENDING LIFT AGAIN THE APPEARANCE OF THINGS CHANGED EVEN THE PRETENCE OF ARCHITECTURAL ORNAMENT DISAPPEARED
2893-139322-0006 THE LIGHTS DIMINISHED IN NUMBER AND SIZE THE ARCHITECTURE BECAME MORE AND MORE MASSIVE IN PROPORTION TO THE SPACES AS THE FACTORY QUARTERS WERE REACHED AND IN THE DUSTY BISCUIT MAKING PLACE OF THE POTTERS AMONG THE FELSPAR MILLS IN THE FURNACE ROOMS OF THE METAL WORKERS
2893-139322-0007 THE BLUE CANVAS CLOTHING WAS ON MAN WOMAN AND CHILD MANY OF THESE GREAT AND DUSTY GALLERIES WERE SILENT AVENUES OF MACHINERY ENDLESS RAKED OUT ASHEN FURNACES TESTIFIED TO THE REVOLUTIONARY DISLOCATION
2893-139322-0008 BUT WHEREVER THERE WAS WORK IT WAS BEING DONE BY SLOW MOVING WORKERS IN BLUE CANVAS THE ONLY PEOPLE NOT IN BLUE CANVAS WERE THE OVERLOOKERS OF THE WORK PLACES AND THE ORANGE CLAD LABOUR POLICE AND FRESH FROM THE FLUSHED FACES OF THE DANCING HALLS
2893-139322-0009 THE VOLUNTARY VIGOURS OF THE BUSINESS QUARTER GRAHAM COULD NOTE THE PINCHED FACES THE FEEBLE MUSCLES AND WEARY EYES OF MANY OF THE LATTER DAY WORKERS SUCH AS HE SAW AT WORK WERE NOTICEABLY INFERIOR IN PHYSIQUE TO THE FEW GAILY DRESSED MANAGERS AND FOREWOMEN
2893-139322-0010 WHO WERE DIRECTING THEIR LABOURS THE BURLY LABOURERS OF THE OLD VICTORIAN TIMES HAD FOLLOWED THAT DRAY HORSE AND ALL SUCH LIVING FORCE PRODUCERS TO EXTINCTION THE PLACE OF HIS COSTLY MUSCLES WAS TAKEN BY SOME DEXTEROUS MACHINE
2893-139322-0011 THE LATTER DAY LABOURER MALE AS WELL AS FEMALE WAS ESSENTIALLY A MACHINE MINDER AND FEEDER A SERVANT AND ATTENDANT OR AN ARTIST UNDER DIRECTION THE WOMEN IN COMPARISON WITH THOSE GRAHAM REMEMBERED
2893-139322-0012 WERE AS A CLASS DISTINCTLY PLAIN AND FLAT CHESTED TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF EMANCIPATION FROM THE MORAL RESTRAINTS OF PURITANICAL RELIGION TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF CITY LIFE HAD DONE THEIR WORK IN ELIMINATING THE STRAIN OF FEMININE BEAUTY AND VIGOUR FROM THE BLUE CANVAS MYRIADS
2893-139322-0013 TO BE BRILLIANT PHYSICALLY OR MENTALLY TO BE IN ANY WAY ATTRACTIVE OR EXCEPTIONAL HAD BEEN AND WAS STILL A CERTAIN WAY OF EMANCIPATION TO THE DRUDGE A LINE OF ESCAPE TO THE PLEASURE CITY AND ITS SPLENDOURS AND DELIGHTS AND AT LAST
2893-139322-0014 TO THE EUTHANASY AND PEACE TO BE STEADFAST AGAINST SUCH INDUCEMENTS WAS SCARCELY TO BE EXPECTED OF MEANLY NOURISHED SOULS IN THE YOUNG CITIES OF GRAHAM'S FORMER LIFE THE NEWLY AGGREGATED LABOURING MASS
2893-139322-0015 HAD BEEN A DIVERSE MULTITUDE STILL STIRRED BY THE TRADITION OF PERSONAL HONOUR AND A HIGH MORALITY NOW IT WAS DIFFERENTIATING INTO AN INSTINCT CLASS WITH A MORAL AND PHYSICAL DIFFERENCE OF ITS OWN EVEN WITH A DIALECT OF ITS OWN
2893-139322-0016 THEY PENETRATED DOWNWARD EVER DOWNWARD TOWARDS THE WORKING PLACES PRESENTLY THEY PASSED UNDERNEATH ONE OF THE STREETS OF THE MOVING WAYS AND SAW ITS PLATFORMS RUNNING ON THEIR RAILS FAR OVERHEAD AND CHINKS OF WHITE LIGHTS BETWEEN THE TRANSVERSE SLITS
2893-139322-0017 THE FACTORIES THAT WERE NOT WORKING WERE SPARSELY LIGHTED TO GRAHAM THEY AND THEIR SHROUDED AISLES OF GIANT MACHINES SEEMED PLUNGED IN GLOOM AND EVEN WHERE WORK WAS GOING ON THE ILLUMINATION WAS FAR LESS BRILLIANT THAN UPON THE PUBLIC WAYS
2893-139322-0018 HE CAME TO THE WARREN OF THE JEWELLERS AND WITH SOME DIFFICULTY AND BY USING HIS SIGNATURE OBTAINED ADMISSION TO THESE GALLERIES THEY WERE HIGH AND DARK AND RATHER COLD IN THE FIRST A FEW MEN WERE MAKING ORNAMENTS OF GOLD FILIGREE
2893-139322-0019 EACH MAN AT A LITTLE BENCH BY HIMSELF AND WITH A LITTLE SHADED LIGHT THE LONG VISTA OF LIGHT PATCHES WITH THE NIMBLE FINGERS BRIGHTLY LIT AND MOVING AMONG THE GLEAMING YELLOW COILS AND THE INTENT FACE LIKE THE FACE OF A GHOST IN EACH SHADOW
2893-139322-0020 HAD THE ODDEST EFFECT THE WORK WAS BEAUTIFULLY EXECUTED
2893-139322-0021 FOR THE MOST PART INTRICATE GROTESQUES OR THE RINGING OF THE CHANGES ON A GEOMETRICAL MOTIF THESE WORKERS WORE A PECULIAR WHITE UNIFORM WITHOUT POCKETS OR SLEEVES THEY ASSUMED THIS ON COMING TO WORK BUT AT NIGHT
2893-139322-0022 IN SPITE OF EVERY PRECAUTION THE LABOUR POLICEMAN TOLD THEM IN A DEPRESSED TONE THE DEPARTMENT WAS NOT INFREQUENTLY ROBBED BEYOND WAS A GALLERY OF WOMEN BUSIED IN CUTTING AND SETTING SLABS OF ARTIFICIAL RUBY
2893-139322-0023 MANY OF THESE WORKERS HAD LIPS AND NOSTRILS A LIVID WHITE DUE TO A DISEASE CAUSED BY A PECULIAR PURPLE ENAMEL THAT CHANCED TO BE MUCH IN FASHION ASANO APOLOGISED TO GRAHAM FOR THIS OFFENSIVE SIGHT BUT EXCUSED HIMSELF ON THE SCORE OF THE CONVENIENCE OF THIS ROUTE
2893-139322-0024 THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO SEE SAID GRAHAM THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO SEE TRYING TO AVOID A START AT A PARTICULARLY STRIKING DISFIGUREMENT SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE BETTER WITH HERSELF THAN THAT SAID ASANO
2893-139322-0025 GRAHAM MADE SOME INDIGNANT COMMENTS BUT SIRE WE SIMPLY COULD NOT STAND THAT STUFF WITHOUT THE PURPLE SAID ASANO IN YOUR DAYS PEOPLE COULD STAND SUCH CRUDITIES THEY WERE NEARER THE BARBARIC BY TWO HUNDRED YEARS
2893-139322-0026 AND CAME TO A LITTLE BRIDGE THAT SPANNED A VAULT LOOKING OVER THE PARAPET GRAHAM SAW THAT BENEATH WAS A WHARF UNDER YET MORE TREMENDOUS ARCHINGS THAN ANY HE HAD SEEN THREE BARGES SMOTHERED IN FLOURY DUST WERE BEING UNLOADED OF THEIR CARGOES OF POWDERED FELSPAR
2893-139322-0027 BY A MULTITUDE OF COUGHING MEN EACH GUIDING A LITTLE TRUCK THE DUST FILLED THE PLACE WITH A CHOKING MIST AND TURNED THE ELECTRIC GLARE YELLOW THE VAGUE SHADOWS OF THESE WORKERS GESTICULATED ABOUT THEIR FEET AND RUSHED TO AND FRO AGAINST A LONG STRETCH OF WHITE WASHED WALL
2893-139322-0028 EVERY NOW AND THEN ONE WOULD STOP TO COUGH A SHADOWY HUGE MASS OF MASONRY RISING OUT OF THE INKY WATER BROUGHT TO GRAHAM'S MIND THE THOUGHT OF THE MULTITUDE OF WAYS AND GALLERIES AND LIFTS THAT ROSE FLOOR ABOVE FLOOR OVERHEAD BETWEEN HIM AND THE SKY
2893-139322-0029 THEIR FEET MADE A HOLLOW THUNDER ON THE PLANKS ALONG WHICH THEY WENT TO AND FRO AND AS HE LOOKED AT THIS SCENE SOME HIDDEN VOICE IN THE DARKNESS BEGAN TO SING STOP THAT SHOUTED ONE OF THE POLICEMEN BUT THE ORDER WAS DISOBEYED
2893-139322-0030 AND FIRST ONE AND THEN ALL THE WHITE STAINED MEN WHO WERE WORKING THERE HAD TAKEN UP THE BEATING REFRAIN SINGING IT DEFIANTLY THE SONG OF THE REVOLT THE FEET UPON THE PLANKS THUNDERED NOW TO THE RHYTHM OF THE SONG TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP
2893-139322-0031 THE POLICEMAN WHO HAD SHOUTED GLANCED AT HIS FELLOW AND GRAHAM SAW HIM SHRUG HIS SHOULDERS HE MADE NO FURTHER EFFORT TO STOP THE SINGING AND SO THEY WENT THROUGH THESE FACTORIES AND PLACES OF TOIL SEEING MANY PAINFUL AND GRIM THINGS
2893-139322-0032 THAT WALK LEFT ON GRAHAM'S MIND A MAZE OF MEMORIES FLUCTUATING PICTURES OF SWATHED HALLS AND CROWDED VAULTS SEEN THROUGH CLOUDS OF DUST OF INTRICATE MACHINES THE RACING THREADS OF LOOMS THE HEAVY BEAT OF STAMPING MACHINERY
2893-139322-0033 THE ROAR AND RATTLE OF BELT AND ARMATURE OF ILL LIT SUBTERRANEAN AISLES OF SLEEPING PLACES ILLIMITABLE VISTAS OF PIN POINT LIGHTS HERE WAS THE SMELL OF TANNING AND HERE THE REEK OF A BREWERY
2893-139322-0034 AND HERE UNPRECEDENTED REEKS EVERYWHERE WERE PILLARS AND CROSS ARCHINGS OF SUCH A MASSIVENESS AS GRAHAM HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN THICK TITANS OF GREASY SHINING BRICKWORK CRUSHED BENEATH THE VAST WEIGHT OF THAT COMPLEX CITY WORLD
2893-139322-0035 EVEN AS THESE ANEMIC MILLIONS WERE CRUSHED BY ITS COMPLEXITY AND EVERYWHERE WERE PALE FEATURES LEAN LIMBS DISFIGUREMENT AND DEGRADATION ONCE AND AGAIN AND AGAIN A THIRD TIME
2893-139322-0036 GRAHAM HEARD THE SONG OF THE REVOLT DURING HIS LONG UNPLEASANT RESEARCH IN THESE PLACES AND ONCE HE SAW A CONFUSED STRUGGLE DOWN A PASSAGE AND LEARNT THAT A NUMBER OF THESE SERFS HAD SEIZED THEIR BREAD BEFORE THEIR WORK WAS DONE GRAHAM WAS ASCENDING TOWARDS THE WAYS AGAIN
2893-139322-0037 WHEN HE SAW A NUMBER OF BLUE CLAD CHILDREN RUNNING DOWN A TRANSVERSE PASSAGE AND PRESENTLY PERCEIVED THE REASON OF THEIR PANIC IN A COMPANY OF THE LABOUR POLICE ARMED WITH CLUBS TROTTING TOWARDS SOME UNKNOWN DISTURBANCE AND THEN CAME A REMOTE DISORDER
2893-139322-0038 BUT FOR THE MOST PART THIS REMNANT THAT WORKED WORKED HOPELESSLY ALL THE SPIRIT THAT WAS LEFT IN FALLEN HUMANITY WAS ABOVE IN THE STREETS THAT NIGHT CALLING FOR THE MASTER AND VALIANTLY AND NOISILY KEEPING ITS ARMS
2893-139322-0039 THEY EMERGED FROM THESE WANDERINGS AND STOOD BLINKING IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE MIDDLE PASSAGE OF THE PLATFORMS AGAIN THEY BECAME AWARE OF THE REMOTE HOOTING AND YELPING OF THE MACHINES OF ONE OF THE GENERAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICES
2893-139322-0040 THEN A WOMAN WITH A FACE OF MUTE WHITE TERROR AND ANOTHER WHO GASPED AND SHRIEKED AS SHE RAN WHAT HAS HAPPENED NOW SAID GRAHAM PUZZLED FOR HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR THICK SPEECH THEN HE HEARD IT IN ENGLISH AND PERCEIVED THAT THE THING THAT EVERYONE WAS SHOUTING
2893-139322-0041 THAT MEN YELLED TO ONE ANOTHER THAT WOMEN TOOK UP SCREAMING THAT WAS PASSING LIKE THE FIRST BREEZE OF A THUNDERSTORM CHILL AND SUDDEN THROUGH THE CITY WAS THIS OSTROG HAS ORDERED THE BLACK POLICE TO LONDON THE BLACK POLICE ARE COMING FROM SOUTH AFRICA THE BLACK POLICE THE BLACK POLICE
2893-139322-0042 HE HESITATED LOOKED AT GRAHAM'S FACE AND TOLD HIM THE THING HE ALREADY KNEW BUT HOW CAN THEY KNOW ASKED ASANO GRAHAM HEARD SOMEONE SHOUTING STOP ALL WORK STOP ALL WORK
2893-139322-0043 AND A SWARTHY HUNCHBACK RIDICULOUSLY GAY IN GREEN AND GOLD CAME LEAPING DOWN THE PLATFORMS TOWARD HIM BAWLING AGAIN AND AGAIN IN GOOD ENGLISH THIS IS OSTROG'S DOING OSTROG THE KNAVE THE MASTER IS BETRAYED HIS VOICE WAS HOARSE
2893-139322-0044 HE YELLED AN UNSPEAKABLE HORROR THAT THE BLACK POLICE HAD DONE IN PARIS AND SO PASSED SHRIEKING OSTROG THE KNAVE FOR A MOMENT GRAHAM STOOD STILL FOR IT HAD COME UPON HIM AGAIN THAT THESE THINGS WERE A DREAM
2893-139322-0045 HE LOOKED UP AT THE GREAT CLIFF OF BUILDINGS ON EITHER SIDE VANISHING INTO BLUE HAZE AT LAST ABOVE THE LIGHTS AND DOWN TO THE ROARING TIERS OF PLATFORMS AND THE SHOUTING RUNNING PEOPLE WHO WERE GESTICULATING PAST
2893-139322-0046 THE MASTER IS BETRAYED THEY CRIED THE MASTER IS BETRAYED SUDDENLY THE SITUATION SHAPED ITSELF IN HIS MIND REAL AND URGENT
2893-139322-0047 HE SAID I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN THE HOUR HAS COME HE THOUGHT SWIFTLY WHAT AM I TO DO GO BACK TO THE COUNCIL HOUSE SAID ASANO WHY SHOULD I NOT APPEAL THE PEOPLE ARE HERE
2893-139322-0048 YOU WILL LOSE TIME THEY WILL DOUBT IF IT IS YOU BUT THEY WILL MASS ABOUT THE COUNCIL HOUSE THERE YOU WILL FIND THEIR LEADERS YOUR STRENGTH IS THERE WITH THEM SUPPOSE THIS IS ONLY A RUMOUR
2893-139322-0049 IT SOUNDS TRUE SAID ASANO LET US HAVE THE FACTS SAID GRAHAM
2893-139322-0050 EVEN NOW THE RUINS MAY BE IMPASSABLE GRAHAM REGARDED HIM DOUBTFULLY AND FOLLOWED HIM THEY WENT UP THE STEPPED PLATFORMS TO THE SWIFTEST ONE AND THERE ASANO ACCOSTED A LABOURER THE ANSWERS TO HIS QUESTIONS WERE IN THE THICK VULGAR SPEECH WHAT DID HE SAY ASKED GRAHAM
2893-139322-0051 HAD NOT SOMEONE IN THE WIND VANE OFFICES LEARNT HE SAID A GIRL A GIRL NOT HE SAID A GIRL HE DID NOT KNOW WHO SHE WAS WHO CAME OUT FROM THE COUNCIL HOUSE CRYING ALOUD AND TOLD THE MEN AT WORK AMONG THE RUINS
2893-139322-0052 AND THEN ANOTHER THING WAS SHOUTED SOMETHING THAT TURNED AN AIMLESS TUMULT INTO DETERMINATE MOVEMENTS IT CAME LIKE A WIND ALONG THE STREET
2910-131096-0000 A CERTAIN KING AND QUEEN HAD THREE DAUGHTERS THE CHARMS OF THE TWO ELDER WERE MORE THAN COMMON BUT THE BEAUTY OF THE YOUNGEST WAS SO WONDERFUL THAT THE POVERTY OF LANGUAGE IS UNABLE TO EXPRESS ITS DUE PRAISE THE FAME OF HER BEAUTY WAS SO GREAT
2910-131096-0001 THAT STRANGERS FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES CAME IN CROWDS TO ENJOY THE SIGHT AND LOOKED ON HER WITH AMAZEMENT PAYING HER THAT HOMAGE WHICH IS DUE ONLY TO VENUS HERSELF IN FACT VENUS FOUND HER ALTARS DESERTED
2910-131096-0002 WHILE MEN TURNED THEIR DEVOTION TO THIS YOUNG VIRGIN AS SHE PASSED ALONG THE PEOPLE SANG HER PRAISES AND STREWED HER WAY WITH CHAPLETS AND FLOWERS THIS PERVERSION OF HOMAGE DUE ONLY TO THE IMMORTAL POWERS TO THE EXALTATION OF A MORTAL
2910-131096-0003 GAVE GREAT OFFENCE TO THE REAL VENUS SHAKING HER AMBROSIAL LOCKS WITH INDIGNATION SHE EXCLAIMED AM I THEN TO BE ECLIPSED IN MY HONORS BY A MORTAL GIRL IN VAIN THEN DID THAT ROYAL SHEPHERD WHOSE JUDGMENT WAS APPROVED BY JOVE HIMSELF
2910-131096-0004 GIVE ME THE PALM OF BEAUTY OVER MY ILLUSTRIOUS RIVALS PALLAS AND JUNO BUT SHE SHALL NOT SO QUIETLY USURP MY HONORS I WILL GIVE HER CAUSE TO REPENT OF SO UNLAWFUL A BEAUTY
2910-131096-0005 MISCHIEVOUS ENOUGH IN HIS OWN NATURE AND ROUSES AND PROVOKES HIM YET MORE BY HER COMPLAINTS SHE POINTS OUT PSYCHE TO HIM AND SAYS MY DEAR SON PUNISH THAT CONTUMACIOUS BEAUTY GIVE THY MOTHER A REVENGE AS SWEET AS HER INJURIES ARE GREAT
2910-131096-0006 INFUSE INTO THE BOSOM OF THAT HAUGHTY GIRL A PASSION FOR SOME LOW MEAN UNWORTHY BEING SO THAT SHE MAY REAP A MORTIFICATION AS GREAT AS HER PRESENT EXULTATION AND TRIUMPH CUPID PREPARED TO OBEY THE COMMANDS OF HIS MOTHER
2910-131096-0007 THERE ARE TWO FOUNTAINS IN VENUS'S GARDEN ONE OF SWEET WATERS THE OTHER OF BITTER CUPID FILLED TWO AMBER VASES ONE FROM EACH FOUNTAIN AND SUSPENDING THEM FROM THE TOP OF HIS QUIVER HASTENED TO THE CHAMBER OF PSYCHE WHOM HE FOUND ASLEEP
2910-131096-0008 HE SHED A FEW DROPS FROM THE BITTER FOUNTAIN OVER HER LIPS THOUGH THE SIGHT OF HER ALMOST MOVED HIM TO PITY THEN TOUCHED HER SIDE WITH THE POINT OF HIS ARROW AT THE TOUCH SHE AWOKE AND OPENED EYES UPON CUPID HIMSELF INVISIBLE
2910-131096-0009 WHICH SO STARTLED HIM THAT IN HIS CONFUSION HE WOUNDED HIMSELF WITH HIS OWN ARROW HEEDLESS OF HIS WOUND HIS WHOLE THOUGHT NOW WAS TO REPAIR THE MISCHIEF HE HAD DONE AND HE POURED THE BALMY DROPS OF JOY OVER ALL HER SILKEN RINGLETS
2910-131096-0010 PSYCHE HENCEFORTH FROWNED UPON BY VENUS DERIVED NO BENEFIT FROM ALL HER CHARMS TRUE ALL EYES WERE CAST EAGERLY UPON HER AND EVERY MOUTH SPOKE HER PRAISES
2910-131096-0011 HER TWO ELDER SISTERS OF MODERATE CHARMS HAD NOW LONG BEEN MARRIED TO TWO ROYAL PRINCES BUT PSYCHE IN HER LONELY APARTMENT DEPLORED HER SOLITUDE SICK OF THAT BEAUTY WHICH WHILE IT PROCURED ABUNDANCE OF FLATTERY HAD FAILED TO AWAKEN LOVE
2910-131096-0012 CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF APOLLO AND RECEIVED THIS ANSWER THE VIRGIN IS DESTINED FOR THE BRIDE OF NO MORTAL LOVER HER FUTURE HUSBAND AWAITS HER ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN HE IS A MONSTER WHOM NEITHER GODS NOR MEN CAN RESIST
2910-131096-0013 THIS DREADFUL DECREE OF THE ORACLE FILLED ALL THE PEOPLE WITH DISMAY AND HER PARENTS ABANDONED THEMSELVES TO GRIEF BUT PSYCHE SAID WHY MY DEAR PARENTS DO YOU NOW LAMENT ME
2910-131096-0014 YOU SHOULD RATHER HAVE GRIEVED WHEN THE PEOPLE SHOWERED UPON ME UNDESERVED HONORS AND WITH ONE VOICE CALLED ME A VENUS I NOW PERCEIVE THAT I AM A VICTIM TO THAT NAME I SUBMIT LEAD ME TO THAT ROCK TO WHICH MY UNHAPPY FATE HAS DESTINED ME
2910-131096-0015 ACCORDINGLY ALL THINGS BEING PREPARED THE ROYAL MAID TOOK HER PLACE IN THE PROCESSION WHICH MORE RESEMBLED A FUNERAL THAN A NUPTIAL POMP AND WITH HER PARENTS AMID THE LAMENTATIONS OF THE PEOPLE ASCENDED THE MOUNTAIN
2910-131096-0016 ON THE SUMMIT OF WHICH THEY LEFT HER ALONE AND WITH SORROWFUL HEARTS RETURNED HOME WHILE PSYCHE STOOD ON THE RIDGE OF THE MOUNTAIN PANTING WITH FEAR AND WITH EYES FULL OF TEARS THE GENTLE ZEPHYR RAISED HER FROM THE EARTH
2910-131096-0017 AND BORE HER WITH AN EASY MOTION INTO A FLOWERY DALE BY DEGREES HER MIND BECAME COMPOSED AND SHE LAID HERSELF DOWN ON THE GRASSY BANK TO SLEEP WHEN SHE AWOKE
2910-131096-0018 SHE ENTERED IT AND IN THE MIDST DISCOVERED A FOUNTAIN SENDING FORTH CLEAR AND CRYSTAL WATERS AND FAST BY A MAGNIFICENT PALACE WHOSE AUGUST FRONT IMPRESSED THE SPECTATOR THAT IT WAS NOT THE WORK OF MORTAL HANDS
2910-131096-0019 BUT THE HAPPY RETREAT OF SOME GOD DRAWN BY ADMIRATION AND WONDER SHE APPROACHED THE BUILDING AND VENTURED TO ENTER EVERY OBJECT SHE MET FILLED HER WITH PLEASURE AND AMAZEMENT GOLDEN PILLARS SUPPORTED THE VAULTED ROOF
2910-131096-0020 AND THE WALLS WERE ENRICHED WITH CARVINGS AND PAINTINGS REPRESENTING BEASTS OF THE CHASE AND RURAL SCENES ADAPTED TO DELIGHT THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER PROCEEDING ONWARD SHE PERCEIVED THAT BESIDES THE APARTMENTS OF STATE
2910-131096-0021 THERE WERE OTHERS FILLED WITH ALL MANNER OF TREASURES AND BEAUTIFUL AND PRECIOUS PRODUCTIONS OF NATURE AND ART WHILE HER EYES WERE THUS OCCUPIED A VOICE ADDRESSED HER THOUGH SHE SAW NO ONE UTTERING THESE WORDS SOVEREIGN LADY
2910-131096-0022 RETIRE THEREFORE TO YOUR CHAMBER AND REPOSE ON YOUR BED OF DOWN AND WHEN YOU SEE FIT REPAIR TO THE BATH SUPPER AWAITS YOU IN THE ADJOINING ALCOVE WHEN IT PLEASES YOU TO TAKE YOUR SEAT THERE PSYCHE GAVE EAR TO THE ADMONITIONS OF HER VOCAL ATTENDANTS
2910-131096-0023 AND AFTER REPOSE AND THE REFRESHMENT OF THE BATH SEATED HERSELF IN THE ALCOVE WHERE A TABLE IMMEDIATELY PRESENTED ITSELF WITHOUT ANY VISIBLE AID FROM WAITERS OR SERVANTS AND COVERED WITH THE GREATEST DELICACIES OF FOOD AND THE MOST NECTAREOUS WINES
2910-131096-0024 HER EARS TOO WERE FEASTED WITH MUSIC FROM INVISIBLE PERFORMERS OF WHOM ONE SANG ANOTHER PLAYED ON THE LUTE AND ALL CLOSED IN THE WONDERFUL HARMONY OF A FULL CHORUS SHE HAD NOT YET SEEN HER DESTINED HUSBAND
2910-131096-0025 BUT HIS ACCENTS WERE FULL OF LOVE AND INSPIRED A LIKE PASSION IN HER SHE OFTEN BEGGED HIM TO STAY AND LET HER BEHOLD HIM BUT HE WOULD NOT CONSENT ON THE CONTRARY HE CHARGED HER TO MAKE NO ATTEMPT TO SEE HIM
2910-131096-0026 FOR IT WAS HIS PLEASURE FOR THE BEST OF REASONS TO KEEP CONCEALED WHY SHOULD YOU WISH TO BEHOLD ME HE SAID HAVE YOU ANY DOUBT OF MY LOVE HAVE YOU ANY WISH UNGRATIFIED IF YOU SAW ME PERHAPS YOU WOULD FEAR ME PERHAPS ADORE ME
2910-131096-0027 BUT ALL I ASK OF YOU IS TO LOVE ME I WOULD RATHER YOU WOULD LOVE ME AS AN EQUAL THAN ADORE ME AS A GOD THIS REASONING SOMEWHAT QUIETED PSYCHE FOR A TIME AND WHILE THE NOVELTY LASTED SHE FELT QUITE HAPPY
2910-131096-0028 BUT AT LENGTH THE THOUGHT OF HER PARENTS LEFT IN IGNORANCE OF HER FATE
2910-131096-0029 PREYED ON HER MIND AND MADE HER BEGIN TO FEEL HER PALACE AS BUT A SPLENDID PRISON WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME ONE NIGHT SHE TOLD HIM HER DISTRESS AND AT LAST DREW FROM HIM AN UNWILLING CONSENT THAT HER SISTERS SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO SEE HER
2910-131096-0030 SO CALLING ZEPHYR SHE ACQUAINTED HIM WITH HER HUSBAND'S COMMANDS AND HE PROMPTLY OBEDIENT SOON BROUGHT THEM ACROSS THE MOUNTAIN DOWN TO THEIR SISTER'S VALLEY THEY EMBRACED HER AND SHE RETURNED THEIR CARESSES COME SAID PSYCHE
2910-131096-0031 ENTER WITH ME MY HOUSE AND REFRESH YOURSELVES WITH WHATEVER YOUR SISTER HAS TO OFFER THEN TAKING THEIR HANDS SHE LED THEM INTO HER GOLDEN PALACE AND COMMITTED THEM TO THE CARE OF HER NUMEROUS TRAIN OF ATTENDANT VOICES TO REFRESH THEM IN HER BATHS
2910-131096-0032 AND AT HER TABLE AND TO SHOW THEM ALL HER TREASURES THE VIEW OF THESE CELESTIAL DELIGHTS CAUSED ENVY TO ENTER THEIR BOSOMS AT SEEING THEIR YOUNG SISTER POSSESSED OF SUCH STATE AND SPLENDOR SO MUCH EXCEEDING THEIR OWN
2910-131096-0033 THEY ASKED HER NUMBERLESS QUESTIONS AMONG OTHERS WHAT SORT OF A PERSON HER HUSBAND WAS PSYCHE REPLIED THAT HE WAS A BEAUTIFUL YOUTH WHO GENERALLY SPENT THE DAYTIME IN HUNTING UPON THE MOUNTAINS THE SISTERS NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS REPLY
2910-131096-0034 SOON MADE HER CONFESS THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM THEN THEY PROCEEDED TO FILL HER BOSOM WITH DARK SUSPICIONS CALL TO MIND THEY SAID
2910-131096-0035 THE INHABITANTS OF THIS VALLEY SAY THAT YOUR HUSBAND IS A TERRIBLE AND MONSTROUS SERPENT WHO NOURISHES YOU FOR A WHILE WITH DAINTIES THAT HE MAY BY AND BY DEVOUR YOU TAKE OUR ADVICE PROVIDE YOURSELF WITH A LAMP AND A SHARP KNIFE
2910-131096-0036 PUT THEM IN CONCEALMENT THAT YOUR HUSBAND MAY NOT DISCOVER THEM AND WHEN HE IS SOUND ASLEEP SLIP OUT OF BED BRING FORTH YOUR LAMP AND SEE FOR YOURSELF WHETHER WHAT THEY SAY IS TRUE OR NOT IF IT IS HESITATE NOT TO CUT OFF THE MONSTER'S HEAD AND THEREBY RECOVER YOUR LIBERTY
2910-131096-0037 PSYCHE RESISTED THESE PERSUASIONS AS WELL AS SHE COULD BUT THEY DID NOT FAIL TO HAVE THEIR EFFECT ON HER MIND AND WHEN HER SISTERS WERE GONE THEIR WORDS AND HER OWN CURIOSITY WERE TOO STRONG FOR HER TO RESIST SO SHE PREPARED HER LAMP
2910-131096-0038 AND A SHARP KNIFE AND HID THEM OUT OF SIGHT OF HER HUSBAND WHEN HE HAD FALLEN INTO HIS FIRST SLEEP SHE SILENTLY ROSE AND UNCOVERING HER LAMP BEHELD NOT A HIDEOUS MONSTER BUT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND CHARMING OF THE GODS
2910-131096-0039 WITH TWO DEWY WINGS ON HIS SHOULDERS WHITER THAN SNOW AND WITH SHINING FEATHERS LIKE THE TENDER BLOSSOMS OF SPRING AS SHE LEANED THE LAMP OVER TO HAVE A NEARER VIEW OF HIS FACE A DROP OF BURNING OIL FELL ON THE SHOULDER OF THE GOD
2910-131096-0040 STARTLED WITH WHICH HE OPENED HIS EYES AND FIXED THEM FULL UPON HER THEN WITHOUT SAYING ONE WORD HE SPREAD HIS WHITE WINGS AND FLEW OUT OF THE WINDOW PSYCHE IN VAIN ENDEAVORING TO FOLLOW HIM FELL FROM THE WINDOW TO THE GROUND
2910-131096-0041 CUPID BEHOLDING HER AS SHE LAY IN THE DUST STOPPED HIS FLIGHT FOR AN INSTANT AND SAID O FOOLISH PSYCHE IS IT THUS YOU REPAY MY LOVE AFTER HAVING DISOBEYED MY MOTHER'S COMMANDS AND MADE YOU MY WIFE WILL YOU THINK ME A MONSTER AND CUT OFF MY HEAD
2910-131096-0042 BUT GO RETURN TO YOUR SISTERS WHOSE ADVICE YOU SEEM TO THINK PREFERABLE TO MINE I INFLICT NO OTHER PUNISHMENT ON YOU THAN TO LEAVE YOU FOREVER LOVE CANNOT DWELL WITH SUSPICION SO SAYING HE FLED AWAY LEAVING POOR PSYCHE PROSTRATE ON THE GROUND
2910-131096-0043 FILLING THE PLACE WITH MOURNFUL LAMENTATIONS WHEN SHE HAD RECOVERED SOME DEGREE OF COMPOSURE SHE LOOKED AROUND HER BUT THE PALACE AND GARDENS HAD VANISHED AND SHE FOUND HERSELF IN THE OPEN FIELD NOT FAR FROM THE CITY WHERE HER SISTERS DWELT
2910-131096-0044 PSYCHE MEANWHILE WANDERED DAY AND NIGHT WITHOUT FOOD OR REPOSE IN SEARCH OF HER HUSBAND CASTING HER EYES ON A LOFTY MOUNTAIN HAVING ON ITS BROW A MAGNIFICENT TEMPLE SHE SIGHED AND SAID TO HERSELF PERHAPS MY LOVE MY LORD INHABITS THERE
2910-131096-0045 AND DIRECTED HER STEPS THITHER SHE HAD NO SOONER ENTERED THAN SHE SAW HEAPS OF CORN SOME IN LOOSE EARS AND SOME IN SHEAVES WITH MINGLED EARS OF BARLEY
2910-131096-0046 SCATTERED ABOUT LAY SICKLES AND RAKES AND ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF HARVEST WITHOUT ORDER AS IF THROWN CARELESSLY OUT OF THE WEARY REAPERS HANDS IN THE SULTRY HOURS OF THE DAY THIS UNSEEMLY CONFUSION
2910-131096-0047 BY SEPARATING AND SORTING EVERYTHING TO ITS PROPER PLACE AND KIND
2910-131096-0048 TO ENGAGE THEM ALL IN HER BEHALF THE HOLY CERES WHOSE TEMPLE IT WAS FINDING HER SO RELIGIOUSLY EMPLOYED THUS SPOKE TO HER O PSYCHE TRULY WORTHY OF OUR PITY THOUGH I CANNOT SHIELD YOU FROM THE FROWNS OF VENUS
2910-131096-0049 YET I CAN TEACH YOU HOW BEST TO ALLAY HER DISPLEASURE GO THEN AND VOLUNTARILY SURRENDER YOURSELF TO YOUR LADY AND SOVEREIGN AND TRY BY MODESTY AND SUBMISSION TO WIN HER FORGIVENESS AND PERHAPS HER FAVOR WILL RESTORE YOU THE HUSBAND YOU HAVE LOST
2910-131096-0050 PSYCHE OBEYED THE COMMANDS OF CERES AND TOOK HER WAY TO THE TEMPLE OF VENUS ENDEAVORING TO FORTIFY HER MIND AND RUMINATING ON WHAT SHE SHOULD SAY AND HOW BEST PROPITIATE THE ANGRY GODDESS FEELING THAT THE ISSUE WAS DOUBTFUL AND PERHAPS FATAL
2910-131096-0051 MOST UNDUTIFUL AND FAITHLESS OF SERVANTS SAID SHE DO YOU AT LAST REMEMBER THAT YOU REALLY HAVE A MISTRESS OR HAVE YOU RATHER COME TO SEE YOUR SICK HUSBAND YET LAID UP OF THE WOUND GIVEN HIM BY HIS LOVING WIFE YOU ARE SO ILL FAVORED AND DISAGREEABLE
2910-131096-0052 THAT THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN MERIT YOUR LOVER MUST BE BY DINT OF INDUSTRY AND DILIGENCE I WILL MAKE TRIAL OF YOUR HOUSEWIFERY THEN SHE ORDERED PSYCHE TO BE LED TO THE STOREHOUSE OF HER TEMPLE
2910-131096-0053 WHERE WAS LAID UP A GREAT QUANTITY OF WHEAT BARLEY MILLET VETCHES BEANS AND LENTILS PREPARED FOR FOOD FOR HER PIGEONS AND SAID TAKE AND SEPARATE ALL THESE GRAINS PUTTING ALL OF THE SAME KIND IN A PARCEL BY THEMSELVES
2910-131096-0054 AND SEE THAT YOU GET IT DONE BEFORE EVENING THEN VENUS DEPARTED AND LEFT HER TO HER TASK BUT PSYCHE IN A PERFECT CONSTERNATION AT THE ENORMOUS WORK SAT STUPID AND SILENT WITHOUT MOVING A FINGER TO THE INEXTRICABLE HEAP
2910-131096-0055 WHILE SHE SAT DESPAIRING CUPID STIRRED UP THE LITTLE ANT A NATIVE OF THE FIELDS TO TAKE COMPASSION ON HER THE LEADER OF THE ANT HILL FOLLOWED BY WHOLE HOSTS OF HIS SIX LEGGED SUBJECTS
2910-131096-0056 APPROACHED THE HEAP AND WITH THE UTMOST DILIGENCE TAKING GRAIN BY GRAIN THEY SEPARATED THE PILE SORTING EACH KIND TO ITS PARCEL AND WHEN IT WAS ALL DONE THEY VANISHED OUT OF SIGHT IN A MOMENT
2910-131096-0057 VENUS AT THE APPROACH OF TWILIGHT RETURNED FROM THE BANQUET OF THE GODS BREATHING ODORS AND CROWNED WITH ROSES SEEING THE TASK DONE SHE EXCLAIMED THIS IS NO WORK OF YOURS WICKED ONE
2910-131096-0058 SO SAYING SHE THREW HER A PIECE OF BLACK BREAD FOR HER SUPPER AND WENT AWAY NEXT MORNING VENUS ORDERED PSYCHE TO BE CALLED AND SAID TO HER BEHOLD YONDER GROVE WHICH STRETCHES ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE WATER
2910-131096-0059 THERE YOU WILL FIND SHEEP FEEDING WITHOUT A SHEPHERD WITH GOLDEN SHINING FLEECES ON THEIR BACKS GO FETCH ME A SAMPLE OF THAT PRECIOUS WOOL GATHERED FROM EVERY ONE OF THEIR FLEECES
2910-131096-0060 PSYCHE OBEDIENTLY WENT TO THE RIVERSIDE PREPARED TO DO HER BEST TO EXECUTE THE COMMAND BUT THE RIVER GOD INSPIRED THE REEDS WITH HARMONIOUS MURMURS WHICH SEEMED TO SAY O MAIDEN SEVERELY TRIED TEMPT NOT THE DANGEROUS FLOOD
2910-131096-0061 NOR VENTURE AMONG THE FORMIDABLE RAMS ON THE OTHER SIDE FOR AS LONG AS THEY ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE RISING SUN THEY BURN WITH A CRUEL RAGE TO DESTROY MORTALS WITH THEIR SHARP HORNS OR RUDE TEETH BUT WHEN THE NOONTIDE SUN HAS DRIVEN THE CATTLE TO THE SHADE
2910-131096-0062 AND THE SERENE SPIRIT OF THE FLOOD HAS LULLED THEM TO REST YOU MAY THEN CROSS IN SAFETY AND YOU WILL FIND THE WOOLLY GOLD STICKING TO THE BUSHES AND THE TRUNKS OF THE TREES THUS THE COMPASSIONATE RIVER GOD GAVE PSYCHE INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO ACCOMPLISH HER TASK
2910-131096-0063 AND BY OBSERVING HIS DIRECTIONS SHE SOON RETURNED TO VENUS WITH HER ARMS FULL OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE BUT SHE RECEIVED NOT THE APPROBATION OF HER IMPLACABLE MISTRESS WHO SAID I KNOW VERY WELL IT IS BY NONE OF YOUR OWN DOINGS THAT YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED IN THIS TASK
2910-131096-0064 AND I AM NOT SATISFIED YET THAT YOU HAVE ANY CAPACITY TO MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL BUT I HAVE ANOTHER TASK FOR YOU HERE TAKE THIS BOX AND GO YOUR WAY TO THE INFERNAL SHADES AND GIVE THIS BOX TO PROSERPINE
2910-131096-0065 AND SAY MY MISTRESS VENUS DESIRES YOU TO SEND HER A LITTLE OF YOUR BEAUTY FOR IN TENDING HER SICK SON SHE HAS LOST SOME OF HER OWN BE NOT TOO LONG ON YOUR ERRAND FOR I MUST PAINT MYSELF WITH IT TO APPEAR AT THE CIRCLE OF THE GODS AND GODDESSES THIS EVENING
2910-131096-0066 PSYCHE WAS NOW SATISFIED THAT HER DESTRUCTION WAS AT HAND BEING OBLIGED TO GO WITH HER OWN FEET DIRECTLY DOWN TO EREBUS WHEREFORE TO MAKE NO DELAY OF WHAT WAS NOT TO BE AVOIDED
2910-131096-0067 SHE GOES TO THE TOP OF A HIGH TOWER TO PRECIPITATE HERSELF HEADLONG THUS TO DESCEND THE SHORTEST WAY TO THE SHADES BELOW BUT A VOICE FROM THE TOWER SAID TO HER WHY POOR UNLUCKY GIRL DOST THOU DESIGN TO PUT AN END TO THY DAYS IN SO DREADFUL A MANNER
2910-131096-0068 AND WHAT COWARDICE MAKES THEE SINK UNDER THIS LAST DANGER WHO HAST BEEN SO MIRACULOUSLY SUPPORTED IN ALL THY FORMER THEN THE VOICE TOLD HER HOW BY A CERTAIN CAVE SHE MIGHT REACH THE REALMS OF PLUTO AND HOW TO AVOID ALL THE DANGERS OF THE ROAD
2910-131096-0069 BUT THE VOICE ADDED WHEN PROSERPINE HAS GIVEN YOU THE BOX FILLED WITH HER BEAUTY OF ALL THINGS THIS IS CHIEFLY TO BE OBSERVED BY YOU
2910-131096-0070 PSYCHE ENCOURAGED BY THIS ADVICE OBEYED IT IN ALL THINGS AND TAKING HEED TO HER WAYS TRAVELLED SAFELY TO THE KINGDOM OF PLUTO SHE WAS ADMITTED TO THE PALACE OF PROSERPINE
2910-131096-0071 AND WITHOUT ACCEPTING THE DELICATE SEAT OR DELICIOUS BANQUET THAT WAS OFFERED HER BUT CONTENTED WITH COARSE BREAD FOR HER FOOD SHE DELIVERED HER MESSAGE FROM VENUS PRESENTLY THE BOX WAS RETURNED TO HER SHUT AND FILLED WITH THE PRECIOUS COMMODITY
2910-131096-0072 THEN SHE RETURNED THE WAY SHE CAME AND GLAD WAS SHE TO COME OUT ONCE MORE INTO THE LIGHT OF DAY BUT HAVING GOT SO FAR SUCCESSFULLY THROUGH HER DANGEROUS TASK A LONGING DESIRE SEIZED HER TO EXAMINE THE CONTENTS OF THE BOX
2910-131096-0073 WHAT SAID SHE SHALL I THE CARRIER OF THIS DIVINE BEAUTY NOT TAKE THE LEAST BIT TO PUT ON MY CHEEKS TO APPEAR TO MORE ADVANTAGE IN THE EYES OF MY BELOVED HUSBAND SO SHE CAREFULLY OPENED THE BOX BUT FOUND NOTHING THERE OF ANY BEAUTY AT ALL
2910-131096-0074 BUT AN INFERNAL AND TRULY STYGIAN SLEEP WHICH BEING THUS SET FREE FROM ITS PRISON TOOK POSSESSION OF HER AND SHE FELL DOWN IN THE MIDST OF THE ROAD A SLEEPY CORPSE WITHOUT SENSE OR MOTION BUT CUPID BEING NOW RECOVERED FROM HIS WOUND
2910-131096-0075 AND NOT ABLE LONGER TO BEAR THE ABSENCE OF HIS BELOVED PSYCHE SLIPPING THROUGH THE SMALLEST CRACK OF THE WINDOW OF HIS CHAMBER WHICH HAPPENED TO BE LEFT OPEN FLEW TO THE SPOT WHERE PSYCHE LAY
2910-131096-0076 AND GATHERING UP THE SLEEP FROM HER BODY CLOSED IT AGAIN IN THE BOX AND WAKED PSYCHE WITH A LIGHT TOUCH OF ONE OF HIS ARROWS AGAIN SAID HE HAST THOU ALMOST PERISHED BY THE SAME CURIOSITY
2910-131096-0077 BUT NOW PERFORM EXACTLY THE TASK IMPOSED ON YOU BY MY MOTHER AND I WILL TAKE CARE OF THE REST THEN CUPID AS SWIFT AS LIGHTNING PENETRATING THE HEIGHTS OF HEAVEN PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE JUPITER WITH HIS SUPPLICATION JUPITER LENT A FAVORING EAR
2910-131096-0078 AND PLEADED THE CAUSE OF THE LOVERS SO EARNESTLY WITH VENUS THAT HE WON HER CONSENT ON THIS HE SENT MERCURY TO BRING PSYCHE UP TO THE HEAVENLY ASSEMBLY AND WHEN SHE ARRIVED HANDING HER A CUP OF AMBROSIA HE SAID DRINK THIS PSYCHE AND BE IMMORTAL
2910-131096-0079 NOR SHALL CUPID EVER BREAK AWAY FROM THE KNOT IN WHICH HE IS TIED BUT THESE NUPTIALS SHALL BE PERPETUAL THUS PSYCHE BECAME AT LAST UNITED TO CUPID AND IN DUE TIME THEY HAD A DAUGHTER BORN TO THEM WHOSE NAME WAS PLEASURE

2910-131096-0094 FOR SEE SHE WALKS THE EARTH LOVE'S OWN HIS WEDDED BRIDE BY HOLIEST VOW PLEDGED IN OLYMPUS AND MADE KNOWN TO MORTALS BY THE TYPE WHICH NOW HANGS GLITTERING ON HER SNOWY BROW
298-126790-0000 THE FAMILY AT THE LOCUSTS HAD SLEPT OR WATCHED THROUGH ALL THE DISTURBANCES AT THE COTTAGE OF BIRCH IN PERFECT IGNORANCE OF THEIR OCCURRENCE THE ATTACKS OF THE SKINNERS WERE ALWAYS MADE WITH SO MUCH PRIVACY AS TO EXCLUDE THE SUFFERERS
298-126790-0001 BUT FREQUENTLY THROUGH A DREAD OF FUTURE DEPREDATIONS FROM THE COMMISERATION OF THEIR NEIGHBORS ALSO ADDITIONAL DUTIES HAD DRAWN THE LADIES FROM THEIR PILLOWS AT AN HOUR SOMEWHAT EARLIER THAN USUAL AND CAPTAIN LAWTON
298-126790-0002 NOTWITHSTANDING THE SUFFERINGS OF HIS BODY HAD RISEN IN COMPLIANCE WITH A RULE FROM WHICH HE NEVER DEPARTED OF SLEEPING BUT SIX HOURS AT A TIME THIS WAS ONE OF THE FEW POINTS IN WHICH THE CARE OF THE HUMAN FRAME WAS INVOLVED ON WHICH THE TROOPER AND THE SURGEON OF HORSE WERE EVER KNOWN TO AGREE
298-126790-0003 THE DOCTOR HAD WATCHED DURING THE NIGHT BY THE SIDE OF THE BED OF CAPTAIN SINGLETON WITHOUT ONCE CLOSING HIS EYES OCCASIONALLY HE WOULD PAY A VISIT TO THE WOUNDED ENGLISHMAN WHO BEING MORE HURT IN THE SPIRIT THAN IN THE FLESH
298-126790-0004 TOLERATED THE INTERRUPTIONS WITH A VERY ILL GRACE AND ONCE FOR AN INSTANT HE VENTURED TO STEAL SOFTLY TO THE BED OF HIS OBSTINATE COMRADE AND WAS NEAR SUCCEEDING IN OBTAINING A TOUCH OF HIS PULSE WHEN A TERRIBLE OATH SWORN BY THE TROOPER IN A DREAM
298-126790-0005 STARTLED THE PRUDENT SURGEON AND WARNED HIM OF A TRITE SAYING IN THE CORPS THAT CAPTAIN LAWTON ALWAYS SLEPT WITH ONE EYE OPEN THIS GROUP HAD ASSEMBLED IN ONE OF THE PARLORS AS THE SUN MADE ITS APPEARANCE OVER THE EASTERN HILL DISPERSING THE COLUMNS OF FOG WHICH HAD ENVELOPED THE LOWLAND
298-126790-0006 MISS PEYTON WAS LOOKING FROM A WINDOW IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TENEMENT OF THE PEDDLER AND WAS EXPRESSING A KIND ANXIETY AFTER THE WELFARE OF THE SICK MAN WHEN THE PERSON OF KATY SUDDENLY EMERGED FROM THE DENSE COVERING OF AN EARTHLY CLOUD WHOSE MISTS WERE SCATTERING BEFORE THE CHEERING RAYS OF THE SUN
298-126790-0007 AND WAS SEEN MAKING HASTY STEPS TOWARDS THE LOCUSTS THERE WAS THAT IN THE AIR OF THE HOUSEKEEPER WHICH BESPOKE DISTRESS OF AN UNUSUAL NATURE AND THE KIND HEARTED MISTRESS OF THE LOCUSTS OPENED THE DOOR OF THE ROOM WITH THE BENEVOLENT INTENTION OF SOOTHING A GRIEF
298-126790-0008 THAT SEEMED SO OVERWHELMING A NEARER VIEW OF THE DISTURBED FEATURES OF THE VISITOR CONFIRMED MISS PEYTON IN HER BELIEF AND WITH THE SHOCK THAT GENTLE FEELINGS EVER EXPERIENCE AT A SUDDEN AND ENDLESS SEPARATION FROM EVEN THE MEANEST OF THEIR ASSOCIATES SHE SAID HASTILY
298-126790-0009 KATY IS HE GONE NO MA'AM REPLIED THE DISTURBED DAMSEL WITH GREAT BITTERNESS HE IS NOT YET GONE BUT HE MAY GO AS SOON AS HE PLEASES NOW FOR THE WORST IS DONE
298-126790-0010 AND THOSE HE HAS ON ARE NONE OF THE BEST I CAN TELL YOU HOW EXCLAIMED THE OTHER ASTONISHED COULD ANYONE HAVE THE HEART TO PLUNDER A MAN IN SUCH DISTRESS HEARTS REPEATED KATY CATCHING HER BREATH MEN LIKE THEM HAVE NO BOWELS AT ALL PLUNDER AND DISTRESS INDEED
298-126790-0011 WHY MA'AM THERE WERE IN THE IRON POT IN PLAIN SIGHT FIFTY FOUR GUINEAS OF GOLD BESIDES WHAT LAY UNDERNEATH WHICH I COULDN'T COUNT WITHOUT HANDLING AND I DIDN'T LIKE TO TOUCH IT FOR THEY SAY THAT ANOTHER'S GOLD IS APT TO STICK SO JUDGING FROM THAT IN SIGHT THERE WASN'T LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS
298-126790-0012 BESIDES WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE DEERSKIN PURSE BUT HARVEY IS LITTLE BETTER NOW THAN A BEGGAR AND A BEGGAR MISS JEANETTE IS THE MOST AWFULLY DESPISABLE OF ALL EARTHLY CREATURES
298-126790-0013 THE COUNTENANCE OF KATY CHANGED FROM THE NATURAL EXPRESSION OF CONCERN TO THE SET FORM OF MELANCHOLY AS SHE ANSWERED HE IS HAPPILY REMOVED FROM THE CARES OF THE WORLD THE CHINKING OF THE MONEY MADE HIM GET OUT OF HIS BED AND THE POOR SOUL FOUND THE SHOCK TOO GREAT FOR HIM
298-126790-0014 HE DIED ABOUT TWO HOURS AND TEN MINUTES BEFORE THE COCK CROWED AS NEAR AS WE CAN SAY SHE WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE PHYSICIAN WHO APPROACHING INQUIRED WITH MUCH INTEREST THE NATURE OF THE DISORDER GLANCING HER EYE OVER THE FIGURE OF THIS NEW ACQUAINTANCE KATY INSTINCTIVELY ADJUSTING HER DRESS
298-126790-0015 REPLIED TWAS THE TROUBLES OF THE TIMES AND THE LOSS OF PROPERTY THAT BROUGHT HIM DOWN HE WASTED FROM DAY TO DAY AND ALL MY CARE AND ANXIETY WERE LOST FOR NOW HARVEY IS NO BETTER THAN A BEGGAR AND WHO IS THERE TO PAY ME FOR WHAT I HAVE DONE
298-126790-0016 GOD WILL REWARD YOU FOR ALL THE GOOD YOU HAVE DONE SAID MISS PEYTON MILDLY YES INTERRUPTED THE SPINSTER HASTILY AND WITH AN AIR OF REVERENCE THAT WAS INSTANTLY SUCCEEDED BY AN EXPRESSION THAT DENOTED MORE OF WORLDLY CARE
298-126790-0017 BUT THEN I HAVE LEFT MY WAGES FOR THREE YEARS PAST IN THE HANDS OF HARVEY AND HOW AM I TO GET THEM MY BROTHERS TOLD ME AGAIN AND AGAIN TO ASK FOR MY MONEY BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT ACCOUNTS BETWEEN RELATIONS WERE EASILY SETTLED WERE YOU RELATED THEN TO BIRCH ASKED MISS PEYTON OBSERVING HER TO PAUSE
298-126790-0018 WHY RETURNED THE HOUSEKEEPER HESITATING A LITTLE I THOUGHT WE WERE AS GOOD AS SO I WONDER IF I HAVE NO CLAIM ON THE HOUSE AND GARDEN THOUGH THEY SAY NOW IT IS HARVEY'S IT WILL SURELY BE CONFISCATED TURNING TO LAWTON WHO HAD BEEN SITTING IN ONE POSTURE WITH HIS
298-126790-0019 PIERCING EYES LOWERING AT HER THROUGH HIS THICK BROWS IN SILENCE PERHAPS THIS GENTLEMAN KNOWS HE SEEMS TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN MY STORY MADAM SAID THE TROOPER BOWING VERY LOW BOTH YOU AND THE TALE ARE EXTREMELY INTERESTING KATY SMILED INVOLUNTARILY
298-126790-0020 BUT MY HUMBLE KNOWLEDGE IS LIMITED TO THE SETTING OF A SQUADRON IN THE FIELD AND USING IT WHEN THERE I BEG LEAVE TO REFER YOU TO DOCTOR ARCHIBALD SITGREAVES A GENTLEMAN OF UNIVERSAL ATTAINMENTS AND UNBOUNDED PHILANTHROPY THE VERY MILK OF HUMAN SYMPATHIES AND A MORTAL FOE TO ALL INDISCRIMINATE CUTTING
298-126790-0021 THE SURGEON DREW UP AND EMPLOYED HIMSELF IN WHISTLING A LOW AIR AS HE LOOKED OVER SOME PHIALS ON A TABLE BUT THE HOUSEKEEPER TURNING TO HIM WITH AN INCLINATION OF THE HEAD CONTINUED I SUPPOSE SIR A WOMAN HAS NO DOWER IN HER HUSBAND'S PROPERTY UNLESS THEY BE ACTUALLY MARRIED
298-126790-0022 IT WAS A MAXIM WITH DOCTOR SITGREAVES THAT NO SPECIES OF KNOWLEDGE WAS TO BE DESPISED AND CONSEQUENTLY HE WAS AN EMPIRIC IN EVERYTHING BUT HIS PROFESSION AT FIRST INDIGNATION AT THE IRONY OF HIS COMRADE KEPT HIM SILENT BUT SUDDENLY CHANGING HIS PURPOSE
298-126790-0023 HE ANSWERED THE APPLICANT WITH A GOOD NATURED SMILE I JUDGE NOT IF DEATH HAS ANTICIPATED YOUR NUPTIALS I AM FEARFUL YOU HAVE NO REMEDY AGAINST HIS STERN DECREES TO KATY THIS SOUNDED WELL ALTHOUGH SHE UNDERSTOOD NOTHING OF ITS MEANING BUT DEATH AND NUPTIALS
298-126790-0024 TO THIS PART OF HIS SPEECH THEN SHE DIRECTED HER REPLY I DID THINK HE ONLY WAITED THE DEATH OF THE OLD GENTLEMAN BEFORE HE MARRIED SAID THE HOUSEKEEPER LOOKING ON THE CARPET BUT NOW HE IS NOTHING MORE THAN DESPISABLE OR WHAT'S THE SAME THING A PEDDLER WITHOUT HOUSE PACK OR MONEY
298-126790-0025 IT MIGHT BE HARD FOR A MAN TO GET A WIFE AT ALL IN SUCH A PREDICARY DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD MISS PEYTON I SELDOM TROUBLE MYSELF WITH SUCH THINGS SAID THE LADY GRAVELY DURING THIS DIALOGUE CAPTAIN LAWTON HAD BEEN STUDYING THE COUNTENANCE AND MANNER OF THE HOUSEKEEPER WITH A MOST LUDICROUS GRAVITY
298-126790-0026 AND FEARFUL THE CONVERSATION WOULD CEASE HE INQUIRED WITH AN APPEARANCE OF GREAT INTEREST YOU THINK IT WAS AGE AND DEBILITY THAT REMOVED THE OLD GENTLEMAN AT LAST AND THE TROUBLESOME TIMES TROUBLE IS A HEAVY PULL DOWN TO A SICK BED
298-126790-0027 BUT I SUPPOSE HIS TIME HAD COME AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT MATTERS BUT LITTLE WHAT DOCTOR'S STUFF WE TAKE LET ME SET YOU RIGHT IN THAT PARTICULAR INTERRUPTED THE SURGEON WE MUST ALL DIE IT IS TRUE BUT IT IS PERMITTED US TO USE THE LIGHTS OF SCIENCE IN ARRESTING DANGERS AS THEY OCCUR UNTIL
298-126790-0028 WE CAN DIE SECUNDEM ARTEM CRIED THE TROOPER TO THIS OBSERVATION THE PHYSICIAN DID NOT DEIGN TO REPLY BUT DEEMING IT NECESSARY TO HIS PROFESSIONAL DIGNITY THAT THE CONVERSATION SHOULD CONTINUE HE ADDED PERHAPS IN THIS INSTANCE JUDICIOUS TREATMENT MIGHT HAVE PROLONGED THE LIFE OF THE PATIENT
298-126790-0029 WHO ADMINISTERED TO THE CASE NO ONE YET SAID THE HOUSEKEEPER WITH QUICKNESS I EXPECT HE HAS MADE HIS LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT THE SURGEON DISREGARDED THE SMILE OF THE LADIES AND PURSUED HIS INQUIRIES IT IS DOUBTLESS WISE TO BE PREPARED FOR DEATH BUT UNDER WHOSE CARE WAS THE SICK MAN DURING HIS INDISPOSITION
298-126790-0030 UNDER MINE ANSWERED KATY WITH AN AIR OF A LITTLE IMPORTANCE AND CARE THROWN AWAY I MAY WELL CALL IT FOR HARVEY IS QUITE TOO DESPISABLE TO BE ANY SORT OF COMPENSATION AT PRESENT THE MUTUAL IGNORANCE OF EACH OTHER'S MEANING MADE VERY LITTLE INTERRUPTION TO THE DIALOGUE
298-126790-0031 I DOCTORED HIM MOSTLY WITH YARBS SAID THE HOUSEKEEPER SMILING AS IF CONSCIOUS OF ERROR WITH SIMPLES RETURNED THE SURGEON THEY ARE SAFER IN THE HANDS OF THE UNLETTERED THAN MORE POWERFUL REMEDIES BUT WHY HAD YOU NO REGULAR ATTENDANT
298-126790-0032 I'M SURE HARVEY HAS SUFFERED ENOUGH ALREADY FROM HAVING SO MUCH CONCERNS WITH THE RIG'LARS REPLIED THE HOUSEKEEPER HE HAS LOST HIS ALL AND MADE HIMSELF A VAGABOND THROUGH THE LAND AND I HAVE REASON TO RUE THE DAY I EVER CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE
298-126790-0033 DOCTOR SITGREAVES DOES NOT MEAN A RIG'LAR SOLDIER BUT A REGULAR PHYSICIAN MADAM SAID THE TROOPER OH CRIED THE MAIDEN AGAIN CORRECTING HERSELF FOR THE BEST OF ALL REASONS THERE WAS NONE TO BE HAD SO I TOOK CARE OF HIM MYSELF
298-126790-0034 FOR MY PART I AM CLEAR FOR DOCTORING THOUGH HARVEY SAYS I AM KILLING MYSELF WITH MEDICINES
298-126790-0035 THEREIN YOU SHOW YOUR SENSE SAID THE SURGEON APPROACHING THE SPINSTER WHO SAT HOLDING THE PALMS OF HER HANDS AND THE SOLES OF HER FEET TO THE GENIAL HEAT OF A FINE FIRE MAKING THE MOST OF COMFORT AMID ALL HER TROUBLES
298-126790-0036 YOU APPEAR TO BE A SENSIBLE DISCREET WOMAN AND SOME WHO HAVE HAD OPPORTUNITIES OF ACQUIRING MORE CORRECT VIEWS MIGHT ENVY YOU YOUR RESPECT FOR KNOWLEDGE AND THE LIGHTS OF SCIENCE ALTHOUGH THE HOUSEKEEPER DID NOT ALTOGETHER COMPREHEND THE OTHER'S MEANING SHE KNEW HE USED A COMPLIMENT
298-126790-0037 AND AS SUCH WAS HIGHLY PLEASED WITH WHAT HE SAID
298-126790-0038 IT WAS ALWAYS SAID OF ME THAT I WANTED NOTHING BUT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE QUITE A PHYSICIAN MYSELF SO LONG AS BEFORE I CAME TO LIVE WITH HARVEY'S FATHER THEY CALLED ME THE PETTICOAT DOCTOR MORE TRUE THAN CIVIL I DARE SAY RETURNED THE SURGEON LOSING SIGHT OF THE WOMAN'S CHARACTER IN HIS ADMIRATION OF HER RESPECT FOR THE HEALING ART
298-126790-0039 IN THE ABSENCE OF MORE ENLIGHTENED COUNSELORS THE EXPERIENCE OF A DISCREET MATRON IS FREQUENTLY OF GREAT EFFICACY IN CHECKING THE PROGRESS OF DISEASE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES MADAM IT IS DREADFUL TO HAVE TO CONTEND WITH IGNORANCE AND OBSTINACY
298-126790-0040 HARVEY IS AS OBSTINATE ABOUT SUCH THINGS AS A DUMB BEAST ONE WOULD THINK THE CARE I TOOK OF HIS BEDRIDDEN FATHER MIGHT LEARN HIM BETTER THAN TO DESPISE GOOD NURSING BUT SOME DAY HE MAY KNOW WHAT IT IS TO WANT A CAREFUL WOMAN IN HIS HOUSE THOUGH NOW I AM SURE HE IS TOO DESPISABLE HIMSELF TO HAVE A HOUSE
298-126790-0041 INDEED I CAN EASILY COMPREHEND THE MORTIFICATION YOU MUST HAVE FELT IN HAVING ONE SO SELF WILLED TO DEAL WITH RETURNED THE SURGEON GLANCING HIS EYES REPROACHFULLY AT HIS COMRADE BUT YOU SHOULD RISE SUPERIOR TO SUCH OPINIONS AND PITY THE IGNORANCE BY WHICH THEY ARE ENGENDERED
298-126790-0042 THE HOUSEKEEPER HESITATED A MOMENT AT A LOSS TO COMPREHEND ALL THAT THE SURGEON EXPRESSED YET SHE FELT IT WAS BOTH COMPLIMENTARY AND KIND THEREFORE SUPPRESSING HER NATURAL FLOW OF LANGUAGE A LITTLE SHE REPLIED
298-126790-0043 I TELL HARVEY HIS CONDUCT IS OFTEN CONDEMNABLE AND LAST NIGHT HE MADE MY WORDS GOOD BUT THE OPINIONS OF SUCH UNBELIEVERS IS NOT VERY CONSEQUENTIAL YET IT IS DREADFUL TO THINK HOW HE BEHAVES AT TIMES NOW WHEN HE THREW AWAY THE NEEDLE
298-126790-0044 WHAT SAID THE SURGEON INTERRUPTING HER DOES HE AFFECT TO DESPISE THE NEEDLE BUT IT IS MY LOT TO MEET WITH MEN DAILY WHO ARE EQUALLY PERVERSE AND WHO SHOW A STILL MORE CULPABLE DISRESPECT FOR THE INFORMATION THAT FLOWS FROM THE LIGHTS OF SCIENCE
298-126791-0000 THE MORNING FOUND THEM ALL RESTORED IN SOME MEASURE TO THEIR FORMER EASE OF BODY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE YOUTHFUL CAPTAIN OF DRAGOONS WHO HAD BEEN SO DEEPLY REGRETTED BY DUNWOODIE THE WOUND OF THIS OFFICER WAS SEVERE THOUGH THE SURGEON PERSEVERED IN SAYING THAT IT WAS WITHOUT DANGER
298-126791-0001 AND DOCTOR SITGREAVES REMOVED ALL FURTHER APPREHENSIONS BY CONFIDENTLY PRONOUNCING THAT HE WOULD BE A WELL MAN WITHIN A FORTNIGHT
298-126791-0002 HE BREAKFASTED IN HIS OWN ROOM AND NOTWITHSTANDING CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT SMILES OF THE MAN OF SCIENCE
298-126791-0003 AND THE LATTER ADVANCED PROMPTLY AND LAID HIS FINGERS ON THE PULSE OF THE YOUTH BECKONING TO HIM TO BE SILENT WHILE HE MUTTERED GROWING SYMPTOMS OF A FEBRILE PULSE NO NO MY DEAR GEORGE YOU MUST REMAIN QUIET AND DUMB THOUGH YOUR EYES LOOK BETTER AND YOUR SKIN HAS EVEN A MOISTURE
298-126791-0004 NAY MY DEAR SITGREAVES SAID THE YOUTH TAKING HIS HAND YOU SEE THERE IS NO FEVER ABOUT ME LOOK IS THERE ANY OF JACK LAWTON'S HOARFROST ON MY TONGUE NO INDEED SAID THE SURGEON CLAPPING A SPOON IN THE MOUTH OF THE OTHER FORCING IT OPEN AND LOOKING DOWN HIS THROAT AS IF DISPOSED TO VISIT THE INTERIOR IN PERSON
298-126791-0005 THE TONGUE IS WELL AND THE PULSE BEGINS TO LOWER AGAIN AH THE BLEEDING DID YOU GOOD PHLEBOTOMY IS A SOVEREIGN SPECIFIC FOR SOUTHERN CONSTITUTIONS
298-126791-0006 WHY GEORGE YOUR CASE IS BECOMING SINGULAR CONTINUED THE DOCTOR INSTINCTIVELY THROWING ASIDE HIS WIG YOUR PULSE EVEN AND SOFT YOUR SKIN MOIST BUT YOUR EYE FIERY AND CHEEK FLUSHED OH I MUST EXAMINE MORE CLOSELY INTO THESE SYMPTOMS
298-126791-0007 SOFTLY MY GOOD FRIEND SOFTLY SAID THE YOUTH FALLING BACK ON HIS PILLOW AND LOSING SOME OF THAT COLOR WHICH ALARMED HIS COMPANION I BELIEVE IN EXTRACTING THE BALL YOU DID FOR ME ALL THAT IS REQUIRED I AM FREE FROM PAIN AND ONLY WEAK I DO ASSURE YOU CAPTAIN SINGLETON SAID THE SURGEON WITH HEAT
298-126791-0008 IT IS PRESUMPTUOUS IN YOU TO PRETEND TO TELL YOUR MEDICAL ATTENDANT WHEN YOU ARE FREE FROM PAIN IF IT BE NOT TO ENABLE US TO DECIDE IN SUCH MATTERS OF WHAT AVAIL THE LIGHTS OF SCIENCE FOR SHAME GEORGE FOR SHAME EVEN THAT PERVERSE FELLOW JOHN LAWTON COULD NOT BEHAVE WITH MORE OBSTINACY
298-126791-0009 HIS PATIENT SMILED AS HE GENTLY REPULSED HIS PHYSICIAN IN AN ATTEMPT TO UNDO THE BANDAGES AND WITH A RETURNING GLOW TO HIS CHEEKS INQUIRED
298-126791-0010 IF ANYONE INTERFERES WITH MY PATIENTS CRIED THE DOCTOR HASTILY I WILL TEACH THEM SPIRIT OR NO SPIRIT WHAT IT IS TO MEDDLE WITH ANOTHER MAN'S CONCERNS TUT MY DEAR FELLOW THERE WAS NO INTERFERENCE MADE NOR ANY INTENDED SEE EXHIBITING THE BANDAGES
298-126791-0011 EVERYTHING IS AS YOU LEFT IT BUT IT GLIDED ABOUT THE ROOM WITH THE GRACE OF A FAIRY AND THE TENDERNESS OF AN ANGEL
298-126791-0012 AS HE INQUIRED WITH A BREVITY THAT WOULD HAVE HONORED LIEUTENANT MASON HAD IT PETTICOATS GEORGE I SAW NOTHING BUT ITS HEAVENLY EYES ITS BLOOM ITS MAJESTIC STEP ITS GRACE REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN WITH RATHER MORE ARDOR THAN HIS SURGEON THOUGHT CONSISTENT WITH HIS DEBILITATED CONDITION
298-126791-0013 HEM WITH SOMETHING OF THE KIND OF STEP YOU SPEAK OF A VERY COMPLACENT EYE AND AS TO THE BLOOM I DARE SAY OFFICES OF CHARITY CAN SUMMON AS FINE A COLOR TO HER CHEEKS AS GLOWS IN THE FACES OF HER MORE YOUTHFUL NIECES NIECES HAS SHE NIECES THEN
298-126791-0014 THE ANGEL I SAW MAY BE A DAUGHTER A SISTER OR A NIECE BUT NEVER AN AUNT HUSH GEORGE HUSH YOUR TALKING HAS BROUGHT YOUR PULSE UP AGAIN YOU MUST OBSERVE QUIET AND PREPARE FOR A MEETING WITH YOUR OWN SISTER WHO WILL BE HERE WITHIN AN HOUR WHAT ISABELLA AND WHO SENT FOR HER
298-126791-0015 THE MAJOR CONSIDERATE DUNWOODIE MURMURED THE EXHAUSTED YOUTH SINKING AGAIN ON HIS PILLOW WHERE THE COMMANDS OF HIS ATTENDANT COMPELLED HIM TO REMAIN SILENT EVEN CAPTAIN LAWTON HAD BEEN RECEIVED WITH MANY AND COURTEOUS INQUIRIES AFTER THE STATE OF HIS HEALTH
298-126791-0016 FROM ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY WHEN HE MADE HIS MORNING ENTRANCE BUT AN INVISIBLE SPIRIT PRESIDED OVER THE COMFORTS OF THE ENGLISH COLONEL SARAH HAD SHRUNK WITH CONSCIOUSNESS FROM ENTERING THE ROOM YET SHE KNEW THE POSITION OF EVERY GLASS AND HAD WITH HER OWN HANDS SUPPLIED THE CONTENTS OF EVERY BOWL THAT STOOD ON HIS TABLE
298-126791-0017 AT THE TIME OF OUR TALE WE WERE A DIVIDED PEOPLE AND SARAH THOUGHT IT WAS NO MORE THAN HER DUTY TO CHERISH THE INSTITUTIONS OF THAT COUNTRY TO WHICH SHE YET CLUNG AS THE LAND OF HER FOREFATHERS BUT THERE WERE OTHER AND MORE COGENT REASONS FOR THE SILENT PREFERENCE SHE WAS GIVING TO THE ENGLISHMAN
298-126791-0018 IT IS TRUE HE WANTED THE PERSONAL EXCELLENCE OF PEYTON DUNWOODIE BUT HIS PRETENSIONS WERE FAR FROM CONTEMPTIBLE SARAH HAD MOVED ABOUT THE HOUSE DURING THE MORNING CASTING FREQUENT AND LONGING GLANCES AT THE DOOR OF WELLMERE'S APARTMENT ANXIOUS TO LEARN THE CONDITION OF HIS WOUNDS AND YET ASHAMED TO INQUIRE
298-126791-0019 CONSCIOUS INTEREST KEPT HER TONGUE TIED UNTIL HER SISTER WITH THE FRANKNESS OF INNOCENCE HAD PUT THE DESIRED QUESTION TO DOCTOR SITGREAVES COLONEL WELLMERE SAID THE OPERATOR GRAVELY IS IN WHAT I CALL A STATE OF FREE WILL MADAM HE IS ILL OR HE IS WELL AS HE PLEASES
298-126791-0020 HIS CASE YOUNG LADY EXCEEDS MY ART TO HEAL AND I TAKE IT SIR HENRY CLINTON IS THE BEST ADVISER HE CAN APPLY TO THOUGH MAJOR DUNWOODIE HAS MADE THE COMMUNICATION WITH HIS LEECH RATHER DIFFICULT FRANCES SMILED BUT AVERTED HER FACE WHILE SARAH MOVED WITH THE GRACE OF AN OFFENDED JUNO FROM THE APARTMENT
298-126791-0021 HER OWN ROOM HOWEVER AFFORDED HER BUT LITTLE RELIEF AND IN PASSING THROUGH THE LONG GALLERY THAT COMMUNICATED WITH EACH OF THE CHAMBERS OF THE BUILDING SHE NOTICED THE DOOR OF SINGLETON'S ROOM TO BE OPEN THE WOUNDED YOUTH SEEMED SLEEPING AND WAS ALONE
298-126791-0022 AND POSSIBLY DREAMING THAT THESE LITTLE FEMININE OFFICES WERE PERFORMED FOR ANOTHER HER NATURAL BLOOM WAS HEIGHTENED BY THE INSINUATION OF THE SURGEON NOR WAS THE LUSTER OF HER EYE IN ANY DEGREE DIMINISHED THE SOUND OF THE APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS OF SITGREAVES HASTENED HER RETREAT DOWN A PRIVATE STAIRWAY TO THE SIDE OF HER SISTER
298-126791-0023 THE SISTERS THEN SOUGHT THE FRESH AIR ON THE PIAZZA AND AS THEY PURSUED THEIR WALK ARM IN ARM THE FOLLOWING DIALOGUE TOOK PLACE THERE IS SOMETHING DISAGREEABLE ABOUT THIS SURGEON OF DUNWOODIE SAID SARAH THAT CAUSES ME TO WISH HIM AWAY MOST HEARTILY
298-126791-0024 FRANCES FIXED HER LAUGHING EYES ON HER SISTER BUT FORBEARING TO SPEAK THE OTHER READILY CONSTRUED THEIR EXPRESSION AND HASTILY ADDED BUT I FORGET HE IS ONE OF YOUR RENOWNED CORPS OF VIRGINIANS AND MUST BE SPOKEN OF REVERENTLY AS RESPECTFULLY AS YOU PLEASE MY DEAR SISTER
298-126791-0025 THERE IS BUT LITTLE DANGER OF EXCEEDING THE TRUTH
298-126791-0026 BUT I THINK MISTER DUNWOODIE HAS TAKEN A LIBERTY THAT EXCEEDS THE RIGHTS OF CONSANGUINITY HE HAS MADE OUR FATHER'S HOUSE A HOSPITAL WE OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL THAT NONE OF THE PATIENTS IT CONTAINS ARE DEARER TO US YOUR BROTHER IS ONE TRUE TRUE INTERRUPTED FRANCES BLUSHING TO THE EYES
298-126791-0027 BUT HE LEAVES HIS ROOM AND THINKS HIS WOUND LIGHTLY PURCHASED BY THE PLEASURE OF BEING WITH HIS FRIENDS IF SHE ADDED WITH A TREMULOUS LIP THIS DREADFUL SUSPICION THAT IS AFFIXED TO HIS VISIT WERE REMOVED I COULD CONSIDER HIS WOUND OF LITTLE MOMENT YOU NOW HAVE THE FRUITS OF REBELLION BROUGHT HOME TO YOU
298-126791-0028 A BROTHER WOUNDED AND A PRISONER AND PERHAPS A VICTIM YOUR FATHER DISTRESSED HIS PRIVACY INTERRUPTED AND NOT IMPROBABLY HIS ESTATES TORN FROM HIM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS LOYALTY TO HIS KING FRANCES CONTINUED HER WALK IN SILENCE WHILE FACING THE NORTHERN ENTRANCE TO THE VALE
298-126791-0029 HER EYES WERE UNIFORMLY FASTENED ON THE POINT WHERE THE ROAD WAS SUDDENLY LOST BY THE INTERVENTION OF A HILL AND AT EACH TURN AS SHE LOST SIGHT OF THE SPOT SHE LINGERED UNTIL AN IMPATIENT MOVEMENT OF HER SISTER QUICKENED HER PACE TO AN EVEN MOTION WITH THAT OF HER OWN
298-126791-0030 AT LENGTH A SINGLE HORSE CHAISE WAS SEEN MAKING ITS WAY CAREFULLY AMONG THE STONES WHICH LAY SCATTERED OVER THE COUNTRY ROAD THAT WOUND THROUGH THE VALLEY AND APPROACHED THE COTTAGE
298-126791-0031 THE COLOR OF FRANCES CHANGED AS THE VEHICLE GRADUALLY DREW NEARER AND WHEN SHE WAS ENABLED TO SEE A FEMALE FORM IN IT BY THE SIDE OF A BLACK IN LIVERY HER LIMBS SHOOK WITH AN AGITATION THAT COMPELLED HER TO LEAN ON SARAH FOR SUPPORT IN A FEW MINUTES THE TRAVELERS APPROACHED THE GATE
298-126791-0032 IT WAS THROWN OPEN BY A DRAGOON WHO FOLLOWED THE CARRIAGE AND WHO HAD BEEN THE MESSENGER DISPATCHED BY DUNWOODIE TO THE FATHER OF CAPTAIN SINGLETON MISS PEYTON ADVANCED TO RECEIVE THEIR GUEST AND THE SISTERS UNITED IN GIVING HER THE KINDEST WELCOME
298-126791-0033 STILL FRANCES COULD WITH DIFFICULTY WITHDRAW HER TRUANT EYES FROM THE COUNTENANCE OF THEIR VISITOR SHE WAS YOUNG AND OF A LIGHT AND FRAGILE FORM BUT OF EXQUISITE PROPORTIONS HER EYES WERE LARGE FULL BLACK PIERCING AND AT TIMES A LITTLE WILD HER HAIR WAS LUXURIANT
298-126791-0034 AND AS IT WAS WITHOUT THE POWDER IT WAS THEN THE FASHION TO WEAR IT FELL IN RAVEN BLACKNESS A FEW OF ITS LOCKS HAD FALLEN ON HER CHEEK GIVING ITS CHILLING WHITENESS BY THE CONTRAST A MORE DEADLY CHARACTER
298-126791-0035 DOCTOR SITGREAVES SUPPORTED HER FROM THE CHAISE AND WHEN SHE GAINED THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA SHE TURNED AN EXPRESSIVE LOOK ON THE FACE OF THE PRACTITIONER YOUR BROTHER IS OUT OF DANGER AND WISHES TO SEE YOU MISS SINGLETON SAID THE SURGEON THE LADY BURST INTO A FLOOD OF TEARS
298-126791-0036 FRANCES HAD STOOD CONTEMPLATING THE ACTION AND FACE OF ISABELLA WITH A KIND OF UNEASY ADMIRATION BUT SHE NOW SPRANG TO HER SIDE WITH THE ARDOR OF A SISTER AND KINDLY DRAWING HER ARM WITHIN HER OWN LED THE WAY TO A RETIRED ROOM
298-126791-0037 THE FEELING WAS COMMUNICATED TO ALL THE SPECTATORS AND THEY DISPERSED IN PURSUIT OF THEIR USUAL AVOCATIONS ISABELLA YIELDED TO THE GENTLE INFLUENCE OF FRANCES WITHOUT RESISTANCE
298-126791-0038 AND HAVING GAINED THE ROOM WHERE THE LATTER CONDUCTED HER WEPT IN SILENCE ON THE SHOULDER OF THE OBSERVANT AND SOOTHING GIRL UNTIL FRANCES THOUGHT HER TEARS EXCEEDED THE EMOTION NATURAL TO THE OCCASION
298-126791-0039 THE SOBS OF MISS SINGLETON FOR A TIME WERE VIOLENT AND UNCONTROLLABLE UNTIL WITH AN EVIDENT EXERTION SHE YIELDED TO A KIND OBSERVATION OF HER COMPANION AND SUCCEEDED IN SUPPRESSING HER TEARS RAISING HER FACE TO THE EYES OF FRANCES SHE ROSE
298-126791-0040 MORE COMPOSED THAN HER PREVIOUS AGITATION HAD GIVEN REASON TO EXPECT ISABELLA FOUND HER BROTHER LOOKING BETTER AND IN LESS DANGER THAN HER SENSITIVE IMAGINATION HAD LED HER TO SUPPOSE HER SPIRITS ROSE IN PROPORTION FROM DESPONDENCY SHE PASSED TO SOMETHING LIKE GAYETY
298-126791-0041 HER BEAUTIFUL EYES SPARKLED WITH RENOVATED BRILLIANCY AND HER FACE WAS LIGHTED WITH SMILES SO FASCINATING THAT FRANCES WHO IN COMPLIANCE WITH HER EARNEST ENTREATIES HAD ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE SICK CHAMBER SAT GAZING ON A COUNTENANCE THAT POSSESSED SO WONDERFUL VARIABILITY
298-126791-0042 IMPELLED BY A CHARM THAT WAS BEYOND HER CONTROL THE YOUTH HAD THROWN AN EARNEST LOOK AT FRANCES AS SOON AS HIS SISTER RAISED HERSELF FROM HIS ARMS AND PERHAPS IT WAS THE FIRST GLANCE AT THE LOVELY LINEAMENTS OF OUR HEROINE
298-126791-0043 WHEN THE GAZER TURNED HIS EYES FROM THE VIEW IN DISAPPOINTMENT HE SEEMED BEWILDERED RUBBED HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A MAN AWAKING FROM A DREAM AND MUSED WHERE IS DUNWOODIE ISABELLA HE SAID THE EXCELLENT FELLOW IS NEVER WEARY OF KIND ACTIONS AFTER A DAY OF SUCH SERVICE AS THAT OF YESTERDAY
298-126791-0044 HE HAS SPENT THE NIGHT IN BRINGING ME A NURSE WHOSE PRESENCE ALONE IS ABLE TO RAISE ME FROM MY COUCH THE EXPRESSION OF THE LADY'S COUNTENANCE CHANGED
298-126791-0045 BUT ISABELLA THE MEETING HAS BEEN TOO MUCH FOR YOU YOU TREMBLE ISABELLA MADE NO REPLY SHE STRETCHED HER HAND TOWARDS THE TABLE WHICH HELD THE NOURISHMENT OF THE CAPTAIN AND THE ATTENTIVE FRANCES COMPREHENDED HER WISHES IN A MOMENT A GLASS OF WATER IN SOME MEASURE REVIVED THE SISTER WHO WAS ENABLED TO SAY
298-126791-0046 DOUBTLESS IT IS HIS DUTY TWAS SAID ABOVE A ROYAL PARTY WAS MOVING ON THE RIVER THOUGH I PASSED THE TROOPS BUT TWO MILES FROM THIS SPOT THE LATTER PART OF THE SENTENCE WAS HARDLY AUDIBLE AND IT WAS SPOKEN MORE IN THE MANNER OF A SOLILOQUY THAN AS IF FOR THE EARS OF HER COMPANIONS
298-126791-0047 ON THE MARCH ISABELLA EAGERLY INQUIRED HER BROTHER NO DISMOUNTED AND SEEMINGLY AT REST WAS THE REPLY THE WONDERING DRAGOON TURNED HIS GAZE ON THE COUNTENANCE OF HIS SISTER WHO SAT WITH HER EYE BENT ON THE CARPET IN UNCONSCIOUS ABSENCE BUT FOUND NO EXPLANATION
298-126791-0048 HIS LOOK WAS CHANGED TO THE FACE OF FRANCES WHO STARTLED BY THE EARNESTNESS OF HIS EXPRESSION AROSE AND HASTILY INQUIRED IF HE WOULD HAVE ANY ASSISTANCE IF YOU CAN PARDON THE RUDENESS SAID THE WOUNDED OFFICER MAKING A FEEBLE EFFORT TO RAISE HIS BODY I WOULD REQUEST TO HAVE CAPTAIN LAWTON'S COMPANY FOR A MOMENT
298-126791-0049 FRANCES HASTENED INSTANTLY TO COMMUNICATE HIS WISH TO THAT GENTLEMAN AND IMPELLED BY AN INTEREST SHE COULD NOT CONTROL SHE RETURNED AGAIN TO HER SEAT BY THE SIDE OF MISS SINGLETON LAWTON SAID THE YOUTH IMPATIENTLY AS THE TROOPER ENTERED HEAR YOU FROM THE MAJOR
298-126791-0050 THE EYE OF THE SISTER WAS NOW BENT ON THE FACE OF THE TROOPER WHO MADE HIS SALUTATIONS TO THE LADY WITH EASE BLENDED WITH THE FRANKNESS OF A SOLDIER HIS MAN HAS BEEN HERE TWICE HE SAID TO INQUIRE HOW WE FARED IN THE LAZARETTO AND WHY NOT HIMSELF
298-126791-0051 THAT IS A QUESTION THE MAJOR CAN ANSWER BEST BUT YOU KNOW THE REDCOATS ARE ABROAD AND DUNWOODIE COMMANDS IN THE COUNTY THESE ENGLISH MUST BE LOOKED TO TRUE SAID SINGLETON SLOWLY AS IF STRUCK WITH THE OTHER'S REASONS BUT HOW IS IT THAT YOU ARE IDLE WHEN THERE IS WORK TO DO
298-126791-0052 MY SWORD ARM IS NOT IN THE BEST CONDITION AND ROANOKE HAS BUT A SHAMBLING GAIT THIS MORNING BESIDES THERE IS ANOTHER REASON I COULD MENTION IF IT WERE NOT THAT MISS WHARTON WOULD NEVER FORGIVE ME
298-126791-0053 SPEAK I BEG WITHOUT DREAD OF MY DISPLEASURE SAID FRANCES RETURNING THE GOOD HUMORED SMILE OF THE TROOPER WITH THE ARCHNESS NATURAL TO HER OWN SWEET FACE THE ODORS OF YOUR KITCHEN THEN CRIED LAWTON BLUNTLY FORBID MY QUITTING THE DOMAINS UNTIL I QUALIFY MYSELF TO SPEAK WITH MORE CERTAINTY CONCERNING THE FATNESS OF THE LAND
298-126791-0054 OH AUNT JEANETTE IS EXERTING HERSELF TO DO CREDIT TO MY FATHER'S HOSPITALITY SAID THE LAUGHING GIRL AND I AM A TRUANT FROM HER LABORS AS I SHALL BE A STRANGER TO HER FAVOR UNLESS I PROFFER MY ASSISTANCE
298-126791-0055 FRANCES WITHDREW TO SEEK HER AUNT MUSING DEEPLY ON THE CHARACTER AND EXTREME SENSIBILITY OF THE NEW ACQUAINTANCE CHANCE HAD BROUGHT TO THE COTTAGE THE WOUNDED OFFICER FOLLOWED HER WITH HIS EYES AS SHE MOVED WITH INFANTILE GRACE THROUGH THE DOOR OF HIS APARTMENT AND AS SHE VANISHED FROM HIS VIEW HE OBSERVED
298-126791-0056 A GOOD MOTHERLY LADY BUT AS TO LOVE THAT IS A MATTER OF TASTE A FEW YEARS YOUNGER WITH DEFERENCE TO HER PRUDENCE AND EXPERIENCE WOULD ACCORD BETTER WITH MY FANCY SHE MUST BE UNDER TWENTY SAID THE OTHER QUICKLY IT DEPENDS ON THE WAY YOU COUNT IF YOU BEGIN AT THE HEEL OF LIFE WELL
298-126791-0057 BUT IF YOU RECKON DOWNWARD AS IS MOST COMMON I THINK SHE IS NEARER FORTY YOU HAVE MISTAKEN AN ELDER SISTER FOR THE AUNT SAID ISABELLA LAYING HER FAIR HAND ON THE MOUTH OF THE INVALID YOU MUST BE SILENT YOUR FEELINGS ARE BEGINNING TO AFFECT YOUR FRAME
298-126791-0058 THE ENTRANCE OF DOCTOR SITGREAVES WHO IN SOME ALARM NOTICED THE INCREASE OF FEVERISH SYMPTOMS IN HIS PATIENT ENFORCED THIS MANDATE AND THE TROOPER WITHDREW TO PAY A VISIT OF CONDOLENCE TO ROANOKE WHO HAD BEEN AN EQUAL SUFFERER WITH HIMSELF IN THEIR LAST NIGHT'S SOMERSAULT
298-126791-0059 TO HIS GREAT JOY HIS MAN PRONOUNCED THE STEED TO BE EQUALLY CONVALESCENT WITH THE MASTER AND LAWTON FOUND THAT BY DINT OF RUBBING THE ANIMAL'S LIMBS SEVERAL HOURS WITHOUT CEASING HE WAS ENABLED TO PLACE HIS FEET IN WHAT HE CALLED SYSTEMATIC MOTION
298-126791-0060 ORDERS WERE ACCORDINGLY GIVEN TO BE IN READINESS TO REJOIN THE TROOP AT THE FOUR CORNERS AS SOON AS HIS MASTER HAD SHARED IN THE BOUNTY OF THE APPROACHING BANQUET
298-126791-0061 AND BY HIS SYMPATHY SUCCEEDED IN RESTORING THE COLONEL TO HIS OWN GOOD GRACES
298-126791-0062 WHARTON KNEW THAT THEIR MISFORTUNE AS THEY BOTH TERMED THEIR DEFEAT WAS OWING TO THE OTHER'S RASHNESS BUT HE FORBORE TO SPEAK OF ANYTHING EXCEPT THE UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT WHICH HAD DEPRIVED THE ENGLISH OF THEIR LEADER AND TO WHICH HE GOOD NATUREDLY ASCRIBED THEIR SUBSEQUENT DISCOMFITURE
298-126791-0063 IN SHORT WHARTON SAID THE COLONEL PUTTING ONE LEG OUT OF BED IT MAY BE CALLED A COMBINATION OF UNTOWARD EVENTS YOUR OWN UNGOVERNABLE HORSE PREVENTED MY ORDERS FROM BEING CARRIED TO THE MAJOR IN SEASON TO FLANK THE REBELS VERY TRUE REPLIED THE CAPTAIN KICKING A SLIPPER TOWARDS THE BED
298-126791-0064 HAD WE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING A FEW GOOD FIRES UPON THEM IN FLANK WE SHOULD HAVE SENT THESE BRAVE VIRGINIANS TO THE RIGHT ABOUT AYE AND THAT IN DOUBLE QUICK TIME CRIED THE COLONEL MAKING THE OTHER LEG FOLLOW ITS COMPANION THEN IT WAS NECESSARY TO ROUT THE GUIDES YOU KNOW AND THE MOVEMENT GAVE THEM THE BEST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO CHARGE
298-126791-0065 YES SAID THE OTHER SENDING THE SECOND SLIPPER AFTER THE FIRST AND THIS MAJOR DUNWOODIE NEVER OVERLOOKS AN ADVANTAGE I THINK IF WE HAD THE THING TO DO OVER AGAIN CONTINUED THE COLONEL RAISING HIMSELF ON HIS FEET WE MIGHT ALTER THE CASE VERY MATERIALLY THOUGH THE CHIEF THING THE REBELS HAVE NOW TO BOAST OF IS MY CAPTURE
298-126791-0066 THEY WERE REPULSED YOU SAW IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO DRIVE US FROM THE WOOD AT LEAST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THEY MADE AN ATTACK SAID THE CAPTAIN THROWING THE REST OF HIS CLOTHES WITHIN REACH OF THE COLONEL
298-126791-0067 TRUE TRUE CRIED THE COLONEL WITH ANIMATION HAD I BEEN THERE TO HAVE IMPROVED THAT ADVANTAGE WE MIGHT HAVE TURNED THE TABLE ON THE YANKEES SAYING WHICH HE DISPLAYED STILL GREATER ANIMATION IN COMPLETING HIS TOILET AND HE WAS SOON PREPARED TO MAKE HIS APPEARANCE FULLY RESTORED TO HIS OWN GOOD OPINION AND FAIRLY PERSUADED THAT HIS CAPTURE WAS OWING TO CASUALTIES ABSOLUTELY BEYOND THE CONTROL OF MAN
2989-138028-0000 CHAPTER SIX OF WHAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS NIECE AND HOUSEKEEPER ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHAPTERS IN THE WHOLE HISTORY
2989-138028-0001 BUT IT WAS ALL PREACHING IN THE DESERT AND HAMMERING COLD IRON NEVERTHELESS AMONG MANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS MADE TO HIM THE HOUSEKEEPER SAID TO HIM IN TRUTH MASTER IF YOU DO NOT KEEP STILL AND STAY QUIET AT HOME
2989-138028-0002 WHAT ANSWER GOD WILL GIVE TO YOUR COMPLAINTS HOUSEKEEPER I KNOW NOT NOR WHAT HIS MAJESTY WILL ANSWER EITHER I ONLY KNOW THAT IF I WERE KING I SHOULD DECLINE TO ANSWER THE NUMBERLESS SILLY PETITIONS THEY PRESENT EVERY DAY
2989-138028-0003 AND THEREFORE I SHOULD BE SORRY THAT ANY AFFAIRS OF MINE SHOULD WORRY HIM WHEREUPON THE HOUSEKEEPER SAID TELL US SENOR AT HIS MAJESTY'S COURT ARE THERE NO KNIGHTS THERE ARE REPLIED DON QUIXOTE AND PLENTY OF THEM AND IT IS RIGHT THERE SHOULD BE
2989-138028-0004 TO SET OFF THE DIGNITY OF THE PRINCE AND FOR THE GREATER GLORY OF THE KING'S MAJESTY THEN MIGHT NOT YOUR WORSHIP SAID SHE BE ONE OF THOSE THAT WITHOUT STIRRING A STEP SERVE THEIR KING AND LORD IN HIS COURT
2989-138028-0005 THERE MUST BE ALL SORTS IN THE WORLD
2989-138028-0006 THERE IS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE AND ANOTHER FOR THE COURTIERS WITHOUT QUITTING THEIR CHAMBERS OR THE THRESHOLD OF THE COURT RANGE THE WORLD OVER BY LOOKING AT A MAP WITHOUT ITS COSTING THEM A FARTHING AND WITHOUT SUFFERING HEAT OR COLD HUNGER OR THIRST
2989-138028-0007 BUT WE THE TRUE KNIGHTS ERRANT MEASURE THE WHOLE EARTH WITH OUR OWN FEET EXPOSED TO THE SUN TO THE COLD TO THE AIR TO THE INCLEMENCIES OF HEAVEN BY DAY AND NIGHT ON FOOT AND ON HORSEBACK
2989-138028-0008 NOR DO WE ONLY KNOW ENEMIES IN PICTURES BUT IN THEIR OWN REAL SHAPES AND AT ALL RISKS AND ON ALL OCCASIONS WE ATTACK THEM WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO CHILDISH POINTS OR RULES OF SINGLE COMBAT WHETHER ONE HAS OR HAS NOT A SHORTER LANCE OR SWORD
2989-138028-0009 WHETHER ONE CARRIES RELICS OR ANY SECRET CONTRIVANCE ABOUT HIM WHETHER OR NOT THE SUN IS TO BE DIVIDED AND PORTIONED OUT AND OTHER NICETIES OF THE SORT THAT ARE OBSERVED IN SET COMBATS OF MAN TO MAN THAT YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT BUT I DO
2989-138028-0010 AND YOU MUST KNOW BESIDES THAT THE TRUE KNIGHT ERRANT THOUGH HE MAY SEE TEN GIANTS THAT NOT ONLY TOUCH THE CLOUDS WITH THEIR HEADS BUT PIERCE THEM AND THAT GO EACH OF THEM ON TWO TALL TOWERS BY WAY OF LEGS AND WHOSE ARMS ARE LIKE THE MASTS OF MIGHTY SHIPS AND EACH EYE LIKE A GREAT MILL WHEEL
2989-138028-0011 AND GLOWING BRIGHTER THAN A GLASS FURNACE MUST NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT BE DISMAYED BY THEM ON THE CONTRARY HE MUST ATTACK AND FALL UPON THEM WITH A GALLANT BEARING AND A FEARLESS HEART AND IF POSSIBLE VANQUISH AND DESTROY THEM EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE FOR ARMOUR THE SHELLS OF A CERTAIN FISH
2989-138028-0012 WIELD TRENCHANT BLADES OF DAMASCUS STEEL OR CLUBS STUDDED WITH SPIKES ALSO OF STEEL SUCH AS I HAVE MORE THAN ONCE SEEN
2989-138028-0013 AND IT WOULD BE WELL IF THERE WERE NO PRINCE WHO DID NOT SET A HIGHER VALUE ON THIS SECOND OR MORE PROPERLY SPEAKING FIRST KIND OF KNIGHTS ERRANT FOR AS WE READ IN THEIR HISTORIES
2989-138028-0014 I WOULD INFLICT A CHASTISEMENT UPON THEE FOR THE BLASPHEMY THOU HAST UTTERED THAT ALL THE WORLD SHOULD RING WITH WHAT CAN IT BE THAT A YOUNG HUSSY THAT HARDLY KNOWS HOW TO HANDLE A DOZEN LACE BOBBINS DARES TO WAG HER TONGUE AND CRITICISE THE HISTORIES OF KNIGHTS ERRANT
2989-138028-0015 FOR HE WAS THE MOST HUMBLE MINDED AND COURTEOUS KNIGHT OF HIS TIME
2989-138028-0016 BUT SOME THERE ARE THAT MIGHT HAVE HEARD THEE AND IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WELL FOR THEE IN THAT CASE FOR THEY ARE NOT ALL COURTEOUS OR MANNERLY SOME ARE ILL CONDITIONED SCOUNDRELS NOR IS IT EVERYONE THAT CALLS HIMSELF A GENTLEMAN THAT IS SO IN ALL RESPECTS SOME ARE GOLD OTHERS PINCHBECK
2989-138028-0017 AND ONE HAS NEED OF EXPERIENCE AND DISCERNMENT TO DISTINGUISH THESE TWO KINDS OF GENTLEMEN
2989-138028-0018 GOD BLESS ME SAID THE NIECE THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW SO MUCH UNCLE
2989-138028-0019 AND YET THAT YOU SHOULD FALL INTO A DELUSION SO GREAT AND A FOLLY SO MANIFEST AS TO TRY TO MAKE YOURSELF OUT VIGOROUS WHEN YOU ARE OLD STRONG WHEN YOU ARE SICKLY ABLE TO PUT STRAIGHT WHAT IS CROOKED WHEN YOU YOURSELF ARE BENT BY AGE AND ABOVE ALL A CABALLERO WHEN YOU ARE NOT ONE
2989-138028-0020 ALL THE LINEAGES IN THE WORLD ATTEND TO WHAT I AM SAYING CAN BE REDUCED TO FOUR SORTS WHICH ARE THESE THOSE THAT HAD HUMBLE BEGINNINGS AND WENT ON SPREADING AND EXTENDING THEMSELVES UNTIL THEY ATTAINED SURPASSING GREATNESS THOSE THAT HAD GREAT BEGINNINGS AND MAINTAINED THEM
2989-138028-0021 AND STILL MAINTAIN AND UPHOLD THE GREATNESS OF THEIR ORIGIN THOSE AGAIN THAT FROM A GREAT BEGINNING HAVE ENDED IN A POINT LIKE A PYRAMID HAVING REDUCED AND LESSENED THEIR ORIGINAL GREATNESS
2989-138028-0022 THOSE THAT HAD AN HUMBLE ORIGIN AND ROSE TO THE GREATNESS THEY STILL PRESERVE
2989-138028-0023 FOR EXAMPLES OF THE SECOND SORT OF LINEAGE THAT BEGAN WITH GREATNESS AND MAINTAINS IT STILL WITHOUT ADDING TO IT
2989-138028-0024 OF COUNTLESS PRINCES MONARCHS LORDS MEDES ASSYRIANS PERSIANS GREEKS AND BARBARIANS ALL THESE LINEAGES AND LORDSHIPS HAVE ENDED IN A POINT AND COME TO NOTHING
2989-138028-0025 FOR IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE NOW TO FIND ONE OF THEIR DESCENDANTS AND EVEN SHOULD WE FIND ONE IT WOULD BE IN SOME LOWLY AND HUMBLE CONDITION OF PLEBEIAN LINEAGES I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY SAVE THAT THEY MERELY SERVE TO SWELL THE NUMBER OF THOSE THAT LIVE
2989-138028-0026 AND NOT BY SPENDING AS HE PLEASES BUT BY KNOWING HOW TO SPEND IT WELL THE POOR GENTLEMAN HAS NO WAY OF SHOWING THAT HE IS A GENTLEMAN BUT BY VIRTUE BY BEING AFFABLE WELL BRED COURTEOUS GENTLE MANNERED AND KINDLY NOT HAUGHTY ARROGANT OR CENSORIOUS
2989-138028-0027 BUT ABOVE ALL BY BEING CHARITABLE FOR BY TWO MARAVEDIS GIVEN WITH A CHEERFUL HEART TO THE POOR HE WILL SHOW HIMSELF AS GENEROUS AS HE WHO DISTRIBUTES ALMS WITH BELL RINGING AND NO ONE THAT PERCEIVES HIM TO BE ENDOWED WITH THE VIRTUES I HAVE NAMED
2989-138028-0028 EVEN THOUGH HE KNOW HIM NOT WILL FAIL TO RECOGNISE AND SET HIM DOWN AS ONE OF GOOD BLOOD AND IT WOULD BE STRANGE WERE IT NOT SO PRAISE HAS EVER BEEN THE REWARD OF VIRTUE AND THOSE WHO ARE VIRTUOUS CANNOT FAIL TO RECEIVE COMMENDATION
2989-138028-0029 THERE ARE TWO ROADS MY DAUGHTERS BY WHICH MEN MAY REACH WEALTH AND HONOURS ONE IS THAT OF LETTERS THE OTHER THAT OF ARMS
2989-138028-0030 I AM THEREFORE IN A MEASURE CONSTRAINED TO FOLLOW THAT ROAD
2989-138028-0031 AND IT WILL BE LABOUR IN VAIN FOR YOU TO URGE ME TO RESIST WHAT HEAVEN WILLS FATE ORDAINS REASON REQUIRES AND ABOVE ALL MY OWN INCLINATION FAVOURS FOR KNOWING AS I DO THE COUNTLESS TOILS THAT ARE THE ACCOMPANIMENTS OF KNIGHT ERRANTRY
2989-138028-0032 I KNOW TOO THE INFINITE BLESSINGS THAT ARE ATTAINED BY IT I KNOW THAT THE PATH OF VIRTUE IS VERY NARROW AND THE ROAD OF VICE BROAD AND SPACIOUS I KNOW THEIR ENDS AND GOALS ARE DIFFERENT FOR THE BROAD AND EASY ROAD OF VICE ENDS IN DEATH
2989-138028-0033 I KNOW AS OUR GREAT CASTILIAN POET SAYS THAT IT IS BY RUGGED PATHS LIKE THESE THEY GO THAT SCALE THE HEIGHTS OF IMMORTALITY UNREACHED BY THOSE THAT FALTER HERE BELOW
2989-138028-0034 I CAN TELL YOU NIECE REPLIED DON QUIXOTE IF THESE CHIVALROUS THOUGHTS DID NOT ENGAGE ALL MY FACULTIES THERE WOULD BE NOTHING THAT I COULD NOT DO NOR ANY SORT OF KNICKKNACK THAT WOULD NOT COME FROM MY HANDS PARTICULARLY CAGES AND TOOTH PICKS
2989-138028-0035 AT THIS MOMENT THERE CAME A KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
2989-138028-0036 NOTHING SENOR SAMSON SAID SHE ONLY THAT MY MASTER IS BREAKING OUT PLAINLY BREAKING OUT WHEREABOUTS IS HE BREAKING OUT SENORA ASKED SAMSON HAS ANY PART OF HIS BODY BURST HE IS ONLY BREAKING OUT AT THE DOOR OF HIS MADNESS SHE REPLIED
2989-138028-0037 SO THAT TO BRING HIM ROUND AGAIN EVER SO LITTLE COST ME MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED EGGS
2989-138028-0038 THAT I CAN WELL BELIEVE REPLIED THE BACHELOR FOR THEY ARE SO GOOD AND SO FAT AND SO WELL BRED THAT THEY WOULD NOT SAY ONE THING FOR ANOTHER THOUGH THEY WERE TO BURST FOR IT IN SHORT THEN MISTRESS HOUSEKEEPER THAT IS ALL
2989-138028-0039 SAY THE PRAYER OF SANTA APOLLONIA THAT IS IF YOU KNOW IT FOR I WILL COME PRESENTLY AND YOU WILL SEE MIRACLES WOE IS ME CRIED THE HOUSEKEEPER
2989-138028-0040 THAT WOULD DO IF IT WAS THE TOOTHACHE MY MASTER HAD
2989-138028-0041 I KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING MISTRESS HOUSEKEEPER
2989-138028-0042 REPLIED CARRASCO AND WITH THIS THE HOUSEKEEPER RETIRED
2989-138028-0043 AND ARRANGE WITH HIM WHAT WILL BE TOLD IN ITS PROPER PLACE
2989-138028-0044 ONCE OR TWICE AS WELL AS I REMEMBER REPLIED SANCHO
2989-138028-0045 FOR I KNOW NOT WHAT I AM SO FOCILE MEANS
2989-138028-0046 AND SUBMIT TO WHAT I TEACH THEE I WOULD BET SAID SANCHO THAT FROM THE VERY FIRST YOU UNDERSTOOD ME AND KNEW WHAT I MEANT BUT YOU WANTED TO PUT ME OUT THAT YOU MIGHT HEAR ME MAKE ANOTHER COUPLE OF DOZEN BLUNDERS MAY BE SO REPLIED DON QUIXOTE
2989-138028-0047 BUT TO COME TO THE POINT WHAT DOES TERESA SAY TERESA SAYS
2989-138028-0048 AND SO SAY I SAID DON QUIXOTE CONTINUE SANCHO MY FRIEND GO ON YOU TALK PEARLS TO DAY THE FACT IS CONTINUED SANCHO
2989-138028-0049 AND THE LAMB GOES AS SOON AS THE SHEEP AND NOBODY CAN PROMISE HIMSELF MORE HOURS OF LIFE IN THIS WORLD THAN GOD MAY BE PLEASED TO GIVE HIM
2989-138028-0050 AND THAT THE SAME HE PAID ME OUT OF YOUR ESTATE FOR I DON'T CARE TO STAND ON REWARDS WHICH EITHER COME LATE OR ILL OR NEVER AT ALL GOD HELP ME WITH MY OWN
2989-138028-0051 AND SO LONG AS ONE GAINS SOMETHING THERE IS NOTHING LOST
2989-138028-0052 AND SO WELL UNDERSTOOD RETURNED DON QUIXOTE THAT I HAVE SEEN INTO THE DEPTHS OF THY THOUGHTS AND KNOW THE MARK THOU ART SHOOTING AT WITH THE COUNTLESS SHAFTS OF THY PROVERBS
2989-138028-0053 PLEASE TO RETURN TO MY SERVICE WELL AND GOOD BUT TO SUPPOSE THAT I AM GOING TO DISTURB OR UNHINGE THE ANCIENT USAGE OF KNIGHT ERRANTRY IS ALL NONSENSE AND SO MY SANCHO GET YOU BACK TO YOUR HOUSE AND EXPLAIN MY INTENTIONS TO YOUR TERESA
2989-138028-0054 BENE QUIDEM IF NOT WE REMAIN FRIENDS FOR IF THE PIGEON HOUSE DOES NOT LACK FOOD IT WILL NOT LACK PIGEONS AND BEAR IN MIND MY SON THAT A GOOD HOPE IS BETTER THAN A BAD HOLDING AND A GOOD GRIEVANCE BETTER THAN A BAD COMPENSATION
2989-138028-0055 AND IN SHORT I MEAN TO SAY AND I DO SAY THAT IF YOU DON'T LIKE TO COME ON REWARD WITH ME AND RUN THE SAME CHANCE THAT I RUN GOD BE WITH YOU
2989-138028-0056 THE ARCH WAG SAMSON CAME FORWARD AND EMBRACING HIM AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE SAID WITH A LOUD VOICE O FLOWER OF KNIGHT ERRANTRY O SHINING LIGHT OF ARMS O HONOUR AND MIRROR OF THE SPANISH NATION
2989-138028-0057 MAY GOD ALMIGHTY IN HIS INFINITE POWER GRANT THAT ANY PERSON OR PERSONS WHO WOULD IMPEDE OR HINDER THY THIRD SALLY MAY FIND NO WAY OUT OF THE LABYRINTH OF THEIR SCHEMES NOR EVER ACCOMPLISH WHAT THEY MOST DESIRE AND THEN TURNING TO THE HOUSEKEEPER HE SAID
2989-138028-0058 FOR I KNOW IT IS THE POSITIVE DETERMINATION OF THE SPHERES THAT SENOR DON QUIXOTE SHALL PROCEED TO PUT INTO EXECUTION HIS NEW AND LOFTY DESIGNS AND I SHOULD LAY A HEAVY BURDEN ON MY CONSCIENCE DID I NOT URGE AND PERSUADE THIS KNIGHT NOT TO KEEP THE MIGHT OF HIS STRONG ARM AND THE VIRTUE OF HIS VALIANT SPIRIT
2989-138028-0059 ANY LONGER CURBED AND CHECKED FOR BY HIS INACTIVITY HE IS DEFRAUDING THE WORLD OF THE REDRESS OF WRONGS
2989-138028-0060 OF THE HONOUR OF VIRGINS OF THE AID OF WIDOWS AND OF THE SUPPORT OF WIVES AND OTHER MATTERS OF THIS KIND APPERTAINING BELONGING PROPER AND PECULIAR
2989-138028-0061 ON THEN MY LORD DON QUIXOTE BEAUTIFUL AND BRAVE LET YOUR WORSHIP AND HIGHNESS SET OUT TO DAY RATHER THAN TO MORROW AND IF ANYTHING BE NEEDED FOR THE EXECUTION OF YOUR PURPOSE
2989-138028-0062 WITH ALL THE QUALIFICATIONS REQUISITE TO MAKE A KNIGHT ERRANT'S SQUIRE BUT HEAVEN FORBID THAT TO GRATIFY MY OWN INCLINATION I SHOULD SHAKE OR SHATTER THIS PILLAR OF LETTERS AND VESSEL OF THE SCIENCES AND CUT DOWN THIS TOWERING PALM OF THE FAIR AND LIBERAL ARTS
2989-138028-0063 LET THIS NEW SAMSON REMAIN IN HIS OWN COUNTRY AND BRINGING HONOUR TO IT BRING HONOUR AT THE SAME TIME ON THE GREY HEADS OF HIS VENERABLE PARENTS FOR I WILL BE CONTENT WITH ANY SQUIRE THAT COMES TO HAND AS SANCHO DOES NOT DEIGN TO ACCOMPANY ME
2989-138028-0064 THE BREAD EATEN AND THE COMPANY DISPERSED
2989-138028-0065 WHO THE PANZAS FROM WHOM I AM DESCENDED WERE AND WHAT IS MORE I KNOW AND HAVE LEARNED
2989-138028-0066 NO HAMMER DRIVES THE HOOPS OF A CASK AS SHE DRIVES ONE TO DO WHAT SHE WANTS BUT AFTER ALL A MAN MUST BE A MAN AND A WOMAN A WOMAN AND AS I AM A MAN ANYHOW WHICH I CAN'T DENY I WILL BE ONE IN MY OWN HOUSE TOO LET WHO WILL TAKE IT AMISS
2989-138028-0067 AND SO THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO BUT FOR YOUR WORSHIP TO MAKE YOUR WILL WITH ITS CODICIL IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT CAN'T BE PROVOKED
2989-138028-0068 SO I OFFER AGAIN TO SERVE YOUR WORSHIP FAITHFULLY AND LOYALLY AS WELL AND BETTER THAN ALL THE SQUIRES THAT SERVED KNIGHTS ERRANT IN TIMES PAST OR PRESENT
2989-138028-0069 AS HE WAS THERE DESCRIBED BUT NOW HEARING HIM TALK OF A WILL AND CODICIL THAT COULD NOT BE PROVOKED INSTEAD OF WILL AND CODICIL THAT COULD NOT BE REVOKED
2989-138028-0070 IN FINE DON QUIXOTE AND SANCHO EMBRACED ONE ANOTHER AND MADE FRIENDS AND BY THE ADVICE AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE GREAT CARRASCO WHO WAS NOW THEIR ORACLE IT WAS ARRANGED THAT THEIR DEPARTURE SHOULD TAKE PLACE THREE DAYS THENCE BY WHICH TIME THEY COULD HAVE
2989-138028-0071 ALL THAT WAS REQUISITE FOR THE JOURNEY READY AND PROCURE A CLOSED HELMET WHICH DON QUIXOTE SAID HE MUST BY ALL MEANS TAKE SAMSON OFFERED HIM ONE AS HE KNEW A FRIEND OF HIS
2989-138028-0072 POURED OUT ON THE BACHELOR WERE PAST COUNTING THEY TORE THEIR HAIR THEY CLAWED THEIR FACES AND IN THE STYLE OF THE HIRED MOURNERS THAT WERE ONCE IN FASHION
2989-138028-0073 SAMSON'S INTENTION IN PERSUADING HIM TO SALLY FORTH ONCE MORE WAS TO DO WHAT THE HISTORY RELATES FARTHER ON
2989-138028-0074 WITH WHOM HE HAD PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT
2989-138028-0075 HIS ALFORJAS FURNISHED WITH CERTAIN MATTERS IN THE WAY OF VICTUALS AND HIS PURSE WITH MONEY THAT DON QUIXOTE GAVE HIM TO MEET EMERGENCIES SAMSON EMBRACED HIM AND ENTREATED HIM TO LET HIM HEAR OF HIS GOOD OR EVIL FORTUNES SO THAT HE MIGHT REJOICE OVER THE FORMER
2989-138035-0000 IN WHICH IS RELATED THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENAMOURED SHEPHERD TOGETHER WITH OTHER TRULY DROLL INCIDENTS DON QUIXOTE HAD GONE BUT A SHORT DISTANCE BEYOND DON DIEGO'S VILLAGE WHEN HE FELL IN WITH A COUPLE OF EITHER PRIESTS OR STUDENTS AND A COUPLE OF PEASANTS
2989-138035-0001 AND BOTH STUDENTS AND PEASANTS WERE STRUCK WITH THE SAME AMAZEMENT THAT EVERYBODY FELT WHO SAW DON QUIXOTE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WERE DYING TO KNOW WHO THIS MAN SO DIFFERENT FROM ORDINARY MEN COULD BE DON QUIXOTE SALUTED THEM AND AFTER ASCERTAINING THAT THEIR ROAD WAS THE SAME AS HIS
2989-138035-0002 MADE THEM AN OFFER OF HIS COMPANY AND BEGGED THEM TO SLACKEN THEIR PACE AS THEIR YOUNG ASSES TRAVELLED FASTER THAN HIS HORSE AND THEN TO GRATIFY THEM HE TOLD THEM IN A FEW WORDS WHO HE WAS AND THE CALLING AND PROFESSION HE FOLLOWED
2989-138035-0003 WHICH WAS THAT OF A KNIGHT ERRANT SEEKING ADVENTURES IN ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD HE INFORMED THEM THAT HIS OWN NAME WAS DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA AND THAT HE WAS CALLED BY WAY OF SURNAME THE KNIGHT OF THE LIONS ALL THIS WAS GREEK OR GIBBERISH TO THE PEASANTS
2989-138035-0004 FOR ALL THAT HOWEVER THEY REGARDED HIM WITH ADMIRATION AND RESPECT AND ONE OF THEM SAID TO HIM IF YOU SIR KNIGHT HAVE NO FIXED ROAD AS IT IS THE WAY WITH THOSE WHO SEEK ADVENTURES NOT TO HAVE ANY LET YOUR WORSHIP COME WITH US
2989-138035-0005 WHO IS CALLED PAR EXCELLENCE
2989-138035-0006 AS THE BRIDEGROOM IS CALLED CAMACHO THE RICH SHE IS EIGHTEEN AND HE TWENTY TWO AND THEY ARE FAIRLY MATCHED THOUGH SOME KNOWING ONES WHO HAVE ALL THE PEDIGREES IN THE WORLD BY HEART WILL HAVE IT THAT THE FAMILY OF THE FAIR QUITERIA IS BETTER THAN CAMACHO'S
2989-138035-0007 BUT NO ONE MINDS THAT NOW A DAYS FOR WEALTH CAN SOLDER A GREAT MANY FLAWS AT ANY RATE CAMACHO IS FREE HANDED
2989-138035-0008 HE HAS PROVIDED DANCERS TOO NOT ONLY SWORD BUT ALSO BELL DANCERS FOR IN HIS OWN TOWN THERE ARE THOSE WHO RING THE CHANGES AND JINGLE THE BELLS TO PERFECTION OF SHOE DANCERS I SAY NOTHING FOR OF THEM HE HAS ENGAGED A HOST BUT NONE OF THESE THINGS
2989-138035-0009 NOR OF THE MANY OTHERS I HAVE OMITTED TO MENTION
2989-138035-0010 AND HE LIVED IN THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR TO THAT OF HER PARENTS
2989-138035-0011 SO THAT THE LOVES OF THE TWO CHILDREN BASILIO AND QUITERIA
2989-138035-0012 HE ARRANGED A MATCH FOR HIS DAUGHTER WITH THE RICH CAMACHO
2989-138035-0013 WHO HAD NOT SO LARGE A SHARE OF THE GIFTS OF FORTUNE AS OF NATURE FOR IF THE TRUTH BE TOLD UNGRUDGINGLY HE IS THE MOST AGILE YOUTH WE KNOW A MIGHTY THROWER OF THE BAR A FIRST RATE WRESTLER AND A GREAT BALL PLAYER HE RUNS LIKE A DEER AND LEAPS BETTER THAN A GOAT
2989-138035-0014 BOWLS OVER THE NINE PINS AS IF BY MAGIC
2989-138035-0015 AND ABOVE ALL HANDLES A SWORD AS WELL AS THE BEST
2989-138035-0016 SAY THAT TO MY WIFE SAID SANCHO WHO HAD UNTIL NOW LISTENED IN SILENCE FOR SHE WON'T HEAR OF ANYTHING BUT EACH ONE MARRYING HIS EQUAL HOLDING WITH THE PROVERB EACH EWE TO HER LIKE
2989-138035-0017 IF ALL THOSE WHO LOVE ONE ANOTHER WERE TO MARRY SAID DON QUIXOTE IT WOULD DEPRIVE PARENTS OF THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE AND MARRY THEIR CHILDREN TO THE PROPER PERSON AND AT THE PROPER TIME AND IF IT WAS LEFT TO DAUGHTERS TO CHOOSE HUSBANDS AS THEY PLEASED
2989-138035-0018 ONE WOULD BE FOR CHOOSING HER FATHER'S SERVANT AND ANOTHER SOME ONE SHE HAS SEEN PASSING IN THE STREET AND FANCIES GALLANT AND DASHING THOUGH HE MAY BE A DRUNKEN BULLY
2989-138035-0019 AND THE MATRIMONIAL CHOICE IS VERY LIABLE TO ERROR
2989-138035-0020 WHY THEN SHOULD NOT HE DO THE SAME WHO HAS TO MAKE THE WHOLE JOURNEY OF LIFE DOWN TO THE FINAL HALTING PLACE OF DEATH MORE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE COMPANION HAS TO BE HIS COMPANION IN BED AT BOARD AND EVERYWHERE AS THE WIFE IS TO HER HUSBAND
2989-138035-0021 HE HAS NEVER BEEN SEEN TO SMILE OR HEARD TO UTTER RATIONAL WORD AND HE ALWAYS GOES ABOUT MOODY AND DEJECTED TALKING TO HIMSELF IN A WAY THAT SHOWS PLAINLY HE IS OUT OF HIS SENSES HE EATS LITTLE AND SLEEPS LITTLE AND ALL HE EATS IS FRUIT AND WHEN HE SLEEPS
2989-138035-0022 IF HE SLEEPS AT ALL IT IS IN THE FIELD ON THE HARD EARTH LIKE A BRUTE BEAST SOMETIMES HE GAZES AT THE SKY
2989-138035-0023 THAT HE MIGHT BE TAKEN FOR A CLOTHED STATUE WITH ITS DRAPERY STIRRED BY THE WIND IN SHORT HE SHOWS SUCH SIGNS OF A HEART CRUSHED BY SUFFERING THAT ALL WE WHO KNOW HIM
2989-138035-0024 AND ANY ONE OF THEM OR ANY MOMENT THE HOUSE MAY FALL I HAVE SEEN THE RAIN COMING DOWN AND THE SUN SHINING ALL AT ONE TIME
2989-138035-0025 AND TELL ME IS THERE ANYONE WHO CAN BOAST OF HAVING DRIVEN A NAIL INTO THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE NO FAITH AND BETWEEN A WOMAN'S YES AND NO I WOULDN'T VENTURE TO PUT THE POINT OF A PIN
2989-138035-0026 FOR LOVE I HAVE HEARD SAY
2989-138035-0027 POVERTY WEALTH AND BLEAR EYES PEARLS WHAT ART THOU DRIVING AT SANCHO CURSES ON THEE SAID DON QUIXOTE
2989-138035-0028 NO ONE CAN UNDERSTAND THEE BUT JUDAS HIMSELF AND I WISH HE HAD THEE TELL ME THOU ANIMAL WHAT DOST THOU KNOW ABOUT NAILS OR WHEELS OR ANYTHING ELSE OH IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ME REPLIED SANCHO IT IS NO WONDER MY WORDS ARE TAKEN FOR NONSENSE
2989-138035-0029 BUT NO MATTER I UNDERSTAND MYSELF AND I KNOW I HAVE NOT SAID ANYTHING VERY FOOLISH IN WHAT I HAVE SAID ONLY YOUR WORSHIP SENOR IS ALWAYS GRAVELLING AT EVERYTHING I SAY NAY EVERYTHING I DO
2989-138035-0030 MAYBE THERE ARE TOLEDANS WHO DO NOT HIT IT OFF WHEN IT COMES TO POLISHED TALK THAT IS TRUE SAID THE LICENTIATE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN BRED UP IN THE TANNERIES
2989-138035-0031 AND YET THEY ARE ALL TOLEDANS PURE CORRECT
2989-138035-0032 THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE BEEN BORN IN MAJALAHONDA I SAY OF DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY WHO ARE NOT SO AND DISCRIMINATION IS THE GRAMMAR OF GOOD LANGUAGE IF IT BE ACCOMPANIED BY PRACTICE I SIRS FOR MY SINS HAVE STUDIED CANON LAW AT SALAMANCA
2989-138035-0033 WHERE YOU ARE NOW TAIL LOOK HERE BACHELOR CORCHUELO RETURNED THE LICENTIATE YOU HAVE THE MOST MISTAKEN IDEA IN THE WORLD ABOUT SKILL WITH THE SWORD IF YOU THINK IT USELESS IT IS NO IDEA ON MY PART BUT AN ESTABLISHED TRUTH
2989-138035-0034 AND THESE JOINED WITH MY RESOLUTION WHICH IS NOT SMALL WILL MAKE YOU CONFESS THAT I AM NOT MISTAKEN DISMOUNT AND PUT IN PRACTICE YOUR POSITIONS AND CIRCLES AND ANGLES AND SCIENCE FOR I HOPE TO MAKE YOU SEE STARS AT NOONDAY WITH MY RUDE RAW SWORDSMANSHIP
2989-138035-0035 WHO WILL MAKE ME TURN MY BACK AND THAT THERE IS NOT ONE IN THE WORLD I WILL NOT COMPEL TO GIVE GROUND AS TO WHETHER YOU TURN YOUR BACK OR NOT I DO NOT CONCERN MYSELF REPLIED THE MASTER OF FENCE
2989-138035-0036 THOUGH IT MIGHT BE THAT YOUR GRAVE WOULD BE DUG ON THE SPOT WHERE YOU PLANTED YOUR FOOT THE FIRST TIME I MEAN THAT YOU WOULD BE STRETCHED DEAD THERE FOR DESPISING SKILL WITH THE SWORD
2989-138035-0037 BUT HE WAS MET BY A TAP ON THE MOUTH FROM THE BUTTON OF THE LICENTIATE'S SWORD THAT CHECKED HIM IN THE MIDST OF HIS FURIOUS ONSET AND MADE HIM KISS IT AS IF IT WERE A RELIC THOUGH NOT AS DEVOUTLY AS RELICS ARE AND OUGHT TO BE KISSED
2989-138035-0038 THE END OF IT WAS THAT THE LICENTIATE RECKONED UP FOR HIM BY THRUSTS EVERY ONE OF THE BUTTONS OF THE SHORT CASSOCK HE WORE TORE THE SKIRTS INTO STRIPS LIKE THE TAILS OF A CUTTLEFISH KNOCKED OFF HIS HAT TWICE AND SO COMPLETELY TIRED HIM OUT
2989-138035-0039 THAT IN VEXATION ANGER AND RAGE HE TOOK THE SWORD BY THE HILT AND FLUNG IT AWAY WITH SUCH FORCE THAT ONE OF THE PEASANTS THAT WERE THERE WHO WAS A NOTARY AND WHO WENT FOR IT MADE AN AFFIDAVIT AFTERWARDS THAT HE SENT IT NEARLY THREE QUARTERS OF A LEAGUE
2989-138035-0040 BY MY FAITH SENOR BACHELOR IF YOUR WORSHIP TAKES MY ADVICE YOU WILL NEVER CHALLENGE ANYONE TO FENCE AGAIN ONLY TO WRESTLE AND THROW THE BAR FOR YOU HAVE THE YOUTH AND STRENGTH FOR THAT BUT AS FOR THESE FENCERS AS THEY CALL THEM I HAVE HEARD SAY
2989-138035-0041 THEY CAN PUT THE POINT OF A SWORD THROUGH THE EYE OF A NEEDLE I AM SATISFIED WITH HAVING TUMBLED OFF MY DONKEY SAID CORCHUELO AND WITH HAVING HAD THE TRUTH I WAS SO IGNORANT OF PROVED TO ME BY EXPERIENCE AND GETTING UP HE EMBRACED THE LICENTIATE
2989-138035-0042 AND THEY WERE BETTER FRIENDS THAN EVER AND NOT CARING TO WAIT FOR THE NOTARY WHO HAD GONE FOR THE SWORD
2989-138035-0043 THEY RESOLVED TO PUSH ON SO AS TO REACH THE VILLAGE OF QUITERIA TO WHICH THEY ALL BELONGED IN GOOD TIME DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE JOURNEY THE LICENTIATE HELD FORTH TO THEM ON THE EXCELLENCES OF THE SWORD WITH SUCH CONCLUSIVE ARGUMENTS AND SUCH FIGURES AND MATHEMATICAL PROOFS
2989-138035-0044 IT GREW DARK BUT BEFORE THEY REACHED THE TOWN IT SEEMED TO THEM ALL AS IF THERE WAS A HEAVEN FULL OF COUNTLESS GLITTERING STARS IN FRONT OF IT THEY HEARD TOO THE PLEASANT MINGLED NOTES OF A VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS FLUTES DRUMS
2989-138035-0045 PSALTERIES PIPES
2989-138035-0046 WERE FILLED WITH LIGHTS UNAFFECTED BY THE WIND FOR THE BREEZE AT THE TIME WAS SO GENTLE THAT IT HAD NOT POWER TO STIR THE LEAVES ON THE TREES THE MUSICIANS WERE THE LIFE OF THE WEDDING WANDERING THROUGH THE PLEASANT GROUNDS IN SEPARATE BANDS SOME DANCING
2989-138035-0047 OTHERS SINGING OTHERS PLAYING THE VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS ALREADY MENTIONED
2989-138035-0048 WERE FRISKING AND GAMBOLLING ALL OVER THE MEADOW
2989-138035-0049 EVEN WERE IT UNDER GILDED CEILINGS AND SO TURNED ASIDE A LITTLE OUT OF THE ROAD
2989-138035-0050 AS THE GOOD QUARTERS HE HAD ENJOYED IN THE CASTLE OR HOUSE OF DON DIEGO CAME BACK TO HIS MIND
2989-138035-0051 WHEREIN AN ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF THE WEDDING OF CAMACHO THE RICH TOGETHER WITH THE INCIDENT OF BASILIO THE POOR
2989-138035-0052 SCARCE HAD THE FAIR AURORA GIVEN BRIGHT PHOEBUS TIME TO DRY THE LIQUID PEARLS UPON HER GOLDEN LOCKS WITH THE HEAT OF HIS FERVENT RAYS WHEN DON QUIXOTE SHAKING OFF SLOTH FROM HIS LIMBS
2989-138035-0053 SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND CALLED TO HIS SQUIRE SANCHO WHO WAS STILL SNORING
2989-138035-0054 THAT WITHOUT ENVYING OR BEING ENVIED SLEEPEST
2989-138035-0055 TO INTERFERE WITH THY REPOSE AMBITION BREAKS NOT THY REST NOR DOTH THIS WORLD'S EMPTY POMP DISTURB THEE FOR THE UTMOST REACH OF THY ANXIETY IS TO PROVIDE FOR THY ASS
2989-138035-0056 SINCE UPON MY SHOULDERS THOU HAST LAID THE SUPPORT OF THYSELF THE COUNTERPOISE AND BURDEN THAT NATURE AND CUSTOM HAVE IMPOSED UPON MASTERS THE SERVANT SLEEPS AND THE MASTER LIES AWAKE THINKING HOW HE IS TO FEED HIM ADVANCE HIM AND REWARD HIM
2989-138035-0057 HE AWOKE AT LAST DROWSY AND LAZY AND CASTING HIS EYES ABOUT IN EVERY DIRECTION OBSERVED THERE COMES IF I DON'T MISTAKE
2989-138035-0058 A WEDDING THAT BEGINS WITH SMELLS LIKE THAT BY MY FAITH OUGHT TO BE PLENTIFUL AND UNSTINTING HAVE DONE THOU GLUTTON SAID DON QUIXOTE COME LET US GO AND WITNESS THIS BRIDAL AND SEE WHAT THE REJECTED BASILIO DOES
2989-138035-0059 LET HIM DO WHAT HE LIKES RETURNED SANCHO BE HE NOT POOR HE WOULD MARRY QUITERIA TO MAKE A GRAND MATCH FOR HIMSELF AND HE WITHOUT A FARTHING IS THERE NOTHING ELSE FAITH
2989-138035-0060 SENOR IT'S MY OPINION THE POOR MAN SHOULD BE CONTENT WITH WHAT HE CAN GET
2989-138035-0061 AND IF THAT BE SO AS NO DOUBT IT IS
2989-138035-0062 BUT WHEN SUCH GIFTS FALL TO ONE THAT HAS HARD CASH I WISH MY CONDITION OF LIFE WAS AS BECOMING AS THEY ARE
2989-138035-0063 FOR GOD'S SAKE SANCHO SAID DON QUIXOTE HERE
2989-138035-0064 ONE OF THEM WAS THAT I WAS TO BE LET SAY ALL I LIKED SO LONG AS IT WAS NOT AGAINST MY NEIGHBOUR OR YOUR WORSHIP'S AUTHORITY AND SO FAR IT SEEMS TO ME I HAVE NOT BROKEN THE SAID ARTICLE
2989-138035-0065 AND EVEN IF IT WERE SO I DESIRE YOU TO HOLD YOUR TONGUE AND COME ALONG FOR THE INSTRUMENTS WE HEARD LAST NIGHT ARE ALREADY BEGINNING TO ENLIVEN THE VALLEYS AGAIN AND NO DOUBT THE MARRIAGE WILL TAKE PLACE IN THE COOL OF THE MORNING AND NOT IN THE HEAT OF THE AFTERNOON
2989-138035-0066 AND SIX STEWPOTS THAT STOOD ROUND THE BLAZE HAD NOT BEEN MADE IN THE ORDINARY MOULD OF COMMON POTS FOR THEY WERE SIX HALF WINE JARS EACH FIT TO HOLD THE CONTENTS OF A SLAUGHTER HOUSE
2989-138035-0067 THEY SWALLOWED UP WHOLE SHEEP AND HID THEM AWAY IN THEIR INSIDES WITHOUT SHOWING ANY MORE SIGN OF THEM THAN IF THEY WERE PIGEONS
2989-138035-0068 OF OVER SIX GALLONS EACH AND ALL FILLED AS IT PROVED AFTERWARDS WITH GENEROUS WINES THERE WERE BESIDES PILES OF THE WHITEST BREAD LIKE THE HEAPS OF CORN ONE SEES ON THE THRESHING FLOORS
2989-138035-0069 THERE WAS A WALL MADE OF CHEESES ARRANGED LIKE OPEN BRICK WORK AND TWO CAULDRONS FULL OF OIL
2989-138035-0070 AND PLUNGED INTO ANOTHER CAULDRON OF PREPARED HONEY THAT STOOD CLOSE BY OF COOKS AND COOK MAIDS THERE WERE OVER FIFTY ALL CLEAN BRISK AND BLITHE IN THE CAPACIOUS BELLY OF THE OX WERE A DOZEN SOFT LITTLE SUCKING PIGS WHICH SEWN UP THERE
2989-138035-0071 THE SPICES OF DIFFERENT KINDS DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN BOUGHT BY THE POUND BUT BY THE QUARTER AND ALL LAY OPEN TO VIEW IN A GREAT CHEST
2989-138035-0072 BUT ABUNDANT ENOUGH TO FEED AN ARMY
2989-138035-0073 CONTEMPLATED ALL AND EVERYTHING WON HIS HEART THE FIRST TO CAPTIVATE AND TAKE HIS FANCY WERE THE POTS
2989-138035-0074 GET DOWN AND LOOK ABOUT FOR A LADLE AND SKIM OFF A HEN OR TWO AND MUCH GOOD MAY THEY DO YOU I DON'T SEE ONE SAID SANCHO WAIT A BIT SAID THE COOK SINNER THAT I AM HOW PARTICULAR AND BASHFUL YOU ARE
2989-138035-0075 AND SO SAYING HE SEIZED A BUCKET AND PLUNGING IT INTO ONE OF THE HALF JARS TOOK UP THREE HENS AND A COUPLE OF GEESE
2989-138035-0076 FALL TO FRIEND AND TAKE THE EDGE OFF YOUR APPETITE WITH THESE SKIMMINGS UNTIL DINNER TIME COMES
2989-138035-0077 WELL THEN SAID THE COOK TAKE SPOON AND ALL FOR CAMACHO'S WEALTH AND HAPPINESS FURNISH EVERYTHING
2989-138035-0078 DON QUIXOTE WAS WATCHING THE ENTRANCE AT ONE END OF THE ARCADE OF SOME TWELVE PEASANTS ALL IN HOLIDAY AND GALA DRESS
302-123504-0000 A FIGHT THAT WON FRIENDS THE THING WHICH MORE NEARLY RESEMBLED OUR EARTHLY MEN THAN IT DID THE MARTIANS I HAD SEEN HELD ME PINIONED TO THE GROUND WITH ONE HUGE FOOT
302-123504-0001 WHILE IT JABBERED AND GESTICULATED AT SOME ANSWERING CREATURE BEHIND ME THIS OTHER WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY ITS MATE SOON CAME TOWARD US BEARING A MIGHTY STONE CUDGEL
302-123504-0002 WITH WHICH IT EVIDENTLY INTENDED TO BRAIN ME THE CREATURES WERE ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN FEET TALL STANDING ERECT AND HAD LIKE THE GREEN MARTIANS AN INTERMEDIARY SET OF ARMS OR LEGS
302-123504-0003 MIDWAY BETWEEN THEIR UPPER AND LOWER LIMBS THEIR EYES WERE CLOSE TOGETHER AND NON PROTRUDING THEIR EARS WERE HIGH SET BUT MORE LATERALLY LOCATED THAN THOSE OF THE MARTIANS
302-123504-0004 WHEN A BOLT OF MYRIAD LEGGED HORROR HURLED ITSELF THROUGH THE DOORWAY FULL UPON THE BREAST OF MY EXECUTIONER WITH A SHRIEK OF FEAR THE APE WHICH HELD ME LEAPED THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW BUT ITS MATE CLOSED IN A TERRIFIC
302-123504-0005 DEATH STRUGGLE WITH MY PRESERVER WHICH WAS NOTHING LESS THAN MY FAITHFUL WATCH THING I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO CALL SO HIDEOUS A CREATURE A DOG AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I GAINED MY FEET AND BACKING AGAINST THE WALL I WITNESSED SUCH A
302-123504-0006 BATTLE AS IT IS VOUCHSAFED FEW BEINGS TO SEE THE STRENGTH AGILITY AND BLIND FEROCITY OF THESE TWO CREATURES IS APPROACHED BY NOTHING KNOWN TO EARTHLY MAN
302-123504-0007 MY BEAST HAD AN ADVANTAGE IN HIS FIRST HOLD HAVING SUNK HIS MIGHTY FANGS FAR INTO THE BREAST OF HIS ADVERSARY BUT THE GREAT ARMS AND PAWS OF THE APE
302-123504-0008 BACKED BY MUSCLES FAR TRANSCENDING THOSE OF THE MARTIAN MEN I HAD SEEN HAD LOCKED THE THROAT OF MY GUARDIAN AND SLOWLY WERE CHOKING OUT HIS LIFE AND BENDING BACK HIS HEAD AND NECK UPON HIS BODY
302-123504-0009 WHERE I MOMENTARILY EXPECTED THE FORMER TO FALL LIMP AT THE END OF A BROKEN NECK IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS THE APE WAS TEARING AWAY THE ENTIRE FRONT OF ITS BREAST WHICH WAS HELD IN THE VISE LIKE GRIP OF THE POWERFUL JAWS
302-123504-0010 BACK AND FORTH UPON THE FLOOR THEY ROLLED NEITHER ONE EMITTING A SOUND OF FEAR OR PAIN PRESENTLY I SAW THE GREAT EYES OF MY BEAST BULGING COMPLETELY FROM THEIR SOCKETS AND BLOOD FLOWING FROM ITS NOSTRILS
302-123504-0011 BUT SO ALSO WAS THE APE WHOSE STRUGGLES WERE GROWING MOMENTARILY LESS SUDDENLY I CAME TO MYSELF
302-123504-0012 I SEIZED THE CUDGEL WHICH HAD FALLEN TO THE FLOOR AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE BATTLE AND SWINGING IT WITH ALL THE POWER OF MY EARTHLY ARMS I CRASHED IT FULL UPON THE HEAD OF THE APE CRUSHING HIS SKULL AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN AN EGGSHELL
302-123504-0013 SCARCELY HAD THE BLOW DESCENDED WHEN I WAS CONFRONTED WITH A NEW DANGER THE APE'S MATE RECOVERED FROM ITS FIRST SHOCK OF TERROR HAD RETURNED TO THE SCENE OF THE ENCOUNTER BY WAY OF THE INTERIOR OF THE BUILDING
302-123504-0014 I GLIMPSED HIM JUST BEFORE HE REACHED THE DOORWAY AND THE SIGHT OF HIM NOW ROARING AS HE PERCEIVED HIS LIFELESS FELLOW STRETCHED UPON THE FLOOR AND FROTHING AT THE MOUTH IN THE EXTREMITY OF HIS RAGE FILLED ME I MUST CONFESS
302-123504-0015 WITH DIRE FOREBODINGS I AM EVER WILLING TO STAND AND FIGHT WHEN THE ODDS ARE NOT TOO OVERWHELMINGLY AGAINST ME BUT IN THIS INSTANCE I PERCEIVED NEITHER GLORY NOR PROFIT
302-123504-0016 AGAINST THE IRON MUSCLES AND BRUTAL FEROCITY OF THIS ENRAGED DENIZEN OF AN UNKNOWN WORLD IN FACT THE ONLY OUTCOME OF SUCH AN ENCOUNTER SO FAR AS I MIGHT BE CONCERNED SEEMED SUDDEN DEATH
302-123504-0017 I WAS STANDING NEAR THE WINDOW AND I KNEW THAT ONCE IN THE STREET I MIGHT GAIN THE PLAZA AND SAFETY BEFORE THE CREATURE COULD OVERTAKE ME AT LEAST THERE WAS A CHANCE FOR SAFETY IN FLIGHT
302-123504-0018 AGAINST ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH SHOULD I REMAIN AND FIGHT HOWEVER DESPERATELY IT IS TRUE I HELD THE CUDGEL BUT WHAT COULD I DO WITH IT AGAINST HIS FOUR GREAT ARMS
302-123504-0019 EVEN SHOULD I BREAK ONE OF THEM WITH MY FIRST BLOW FOR I FIGURED THAT HE WOULD ATTEMPT TO WARD OFF THE CUDGEL HE COULD REACH OUT AND ANNIHILATE ME WITH THE OTHERS BEFORE I COULD RECOVER FOR A SECOND ATTACK
302-123504-0020 IN THE INSTANT THAT THESE THOUGHTS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND I HAD TURNED TO MAKE FOR THE WINDOW BUT MY EYES ALIGHTING ON THE FORM OF MY ERSTWHILE GUARDIAN THREW ALL THOUGHTS OF FLIGHT TO THE FOUR WINDS HE LAY GASPING UPON THE FLOOR OF THE CHAMBER
302-123504-0021 HIS GREAT EYES FASTENED UPON ME IN WHAT SEEMED A PITIFUL APPEAL FOR PROTECTION I COULD NOT WITHSTAND THAT LOOK NOR COULD I ON SECOND THOUGHT HAVE DESERTED MY RESCUER WITHOUT GIVING AS GOOD AN ACCOUNT OF MYSELF IN HIS BEHALF
302-123504-0022 AS HE HAD IN MINE WITHOUT MORE ADO THEREFORE I TURNED TO MEET THE CHARGE OF THE INFURIATED BULL APE HE WAS NOW TOO CLOSE UPON ME FOR THE CUDGEL TO PROVE OF ANY EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE
302-123504-0023 SO I MERELY THREW IT AS HEAVILY AS I COULD AT HIS ADVANCING BULK IT STRUCK HIM JUST BELOW THE KNEES ELICITING A HOWL OF PAIN AND RAGE AND SO THROWING HIM OFF HIS BALANCE THAT HE LUNGED FULL UPON ME
302-123504-0024 WITH ARMS WIDE STRETCHED TO EASE HIS FALL AGAIN AS ON THE PRECEDING DAY I HAD RECOURSE TO EARTHLY TACTICS AND SWINGING MY RIGHT FIST FULL UPON THE POINT OF HIS CHIN
302-123504-0025 I BEHELD TARS TARKAS SOLA AND THREE OR FOUR WARRIORS STANDING IN THE DOORWAY OF THE CHAMBER AS MY EYES MET THEIRS I WAS FOR THE SECOND TIME THE RECIPIENT OF THEIR ZEALOUSLY GUARDED APPLAUSE
302-123504-0026 MY ABSENCE HAD BEEN NOTED BY SOLA ON HER AWAKENING AND SHE HAD QUICKLY INFORMED TARS TARKAS WHO HAD SET OUT IMMEDIATELY WITH A HANDFUL OF WARRIORS TO SEARCH FOR ME AS THEY HAD APPROACHED THE LIMITS OF THE CITY
302-123504-0027 THIS ENCOUNTER TOGETHER WITH MY SET TO WITH THE MARTIAN WARRIOR ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AND MY FEATS OF JUMPING PLACED ME UPON A HIGH PINNACLE IN THEIR REGARD EVIDENTLY DEVOID OF ALL THE FINER SENTIMENTS OF FRIENDSHIP
302-123504-0028 LOVE OR AFFECTION THESE PEOPLE FAIRLY WORSHIP PHYSICAL PROWESS AND BRAVERY AND NOTHING IS TOO GOOD FOR THE OBJECT OF THEIR ADORATION AS LONG AS HE MAINTAINS HIS POSITION BY REPEATED EXAMPLES OF HIS SKILL
302-123504-0029 STRENGTH AND COURAGE SOLA WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED THE SEARCHING PARTY OF HER OWN VOLITION WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE MARTIANS WHOSE FACE HAD NOT BEEN TWISTED IN LAUGHTER AS I BATTLED FOR MY LIFE SHE ON THE CONTRARY
302-123504-0030 WAS SOBER WITH APPARENT SOLICITUDE AND AS SOON AS I HAD FINISHED THE MONSTER RUSHED TO ME AND CAREFULLY EXAMINED MY BODY FOR POSSIBLE WOUNDS OR INJURIES SATISFYING HERSELF THAT I HAD COME OFF UNSCATHED SHE SMILED QUIETLY
302-123504-0031 AND TAKING MY HAND STARTED TOWARD THE DOOR OF THE CHAMBER TARS TARKAS AND THE OTHER WARRIORS HAD ENTERED AND WERE STANDING OVER THE NOW RAPIDLY REVIVING BRUTE WHICH HAD SAVED MY LIFE
302-123504-0032 THEY SEEMED TO BE DEEP IN ARGUMENT AND FINALLY ONE OF THEM ADDRESSED ME BUT REMEMBERING MY IGNORANCE OF HIS LANGUAGE TURNED BACK TO TARS TARKAS WHO WITH A WORD AND GESTURE GAVE SOME COMMAND TO THE FELLOW
302-123504-0033 AND TURNED TO FOLLOW US FROM THE ROOM THERE SEEMED SOMETHING MENACING IN THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD MY BEAST AND I HESITATED TO LEAVE UNTIL I HAD LEARNED THE OUTCOME IT WAS WELL I DID SO FOR THE WARRIOR DREW AN
302-123504-0034 EVIL LOOKING PISTOL FROM ITS HOLSTER AND WAS ON THE POINT OF PUTTING AN END TO THE CREATURE WHEN I SPRANG FORWARD AND STRUCK UP HIS ARM THE BULLET STRIKING THE WOODEN CASING OF THE WINDOW EXPLODED
302-123504-0035 BLOWING A HOLE COMPLETELY THROUGH THE WOOD AND MASONRY I THEN KNELT DOWN BESIDE THE FEARSOME LOOKING THING AND RAISING IT TO ITS FEET MOTIONED FOR IT TO FOLLOW ME
302-123504-0036 AND SOLA GRASPING ME TIGHTLY BY THE ARM I HAD AT LEAST TWO FRIENDS ON MARS A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WATCHED OVER ME WITH MOTHERLY SOLICITUDE AND A DUMB BRUTE WHICH AS I LATER CAME TO KNOW
302-123504-0037 HELD IN ITS POOR UGLY CARCASS MORE LOVE MORE LOYALTY MORE GRATITUDE
302-123516-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN CHAINED IN WARHOON IT MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE I REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS
302-123516-0001 AND BENDING OVER ME WAS AN ANCIENT AND UGLY FEMALE AS I OPENED MY EYES SHE TURNED TO ONE OF THE WARRIORS SAYING HE WILL LIVE O JED TIS WELL REPLIED THE ONE SO ADDRESSED
302-123516-0002 RISING AND APPROACHING MY COUCH HE SHOULD RENDER RARE SPORT FOR THE GREAT GAMES AND NOW AS MY EYES FELL UPON HIM I SAW THAT HE WAS NO THARK FOR HIS ORNAMENTS AND METAL WERE NOT OF THAT HORDE
302-123516-0003 HE WAS A HUGE FELLOW TERRIBLY SCARRED ABOUT THE FACE AND CHEST AND WITH ONE BROKEN TUSK AND A MISSING EAR
302-123516-0004 AND DEPENDING FROM THESE A NUMBER OF DRIED HUMAN HANDS HIS REFERENCE TO THE GREAT GAMES OF WHICH I HAD HEARD SO MUCH WHILE AMONG THE THARKS CONVINCED ME THAT I HAD BUT JUMPED FROM PURGATORY INTO GEHENNA
302-123516-0005 AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS WITH THE FEMALE DURING WHICH SHE ASSURED HIM THAT I WAS NOW FULLY FIT TO TRAVEL THE JED ORDERED THAT WE MOUNT AND RIDE AFTER THE MAIN COLUMN
302-123516-0006 I WAS STRAPPED SECURELY TO AS WILD AND UNMANAGEABLE A THOAT AS I HAD EVER SEEN AND WITH A MOUNTED WARRIOR ON EITHER SIDE TO PREVENT THE BEAST FROM BOLTING
302-123516-0007 WE RODE FORTH AT A FURIOUS PACE IN PURSUIT OF THE COLUMN MY WOUNDS GAVE ME BUT LITTLE PAIN SO WONDERFULLY AND RAPIDLY HAD THE APPLICATIONS AND INJECTIONS OF THE FEMALE EXERCISED THEIR THERAPEUTIC POWERS
302-123516-0008 WHO PROVED TO BE THE JEDDAK OF THE HORDES OF WARHOON LIKE THE JED WHO HAD BROUGHT ME HE WAS FRIGHTFULLY SCARRED AND ALSO DECORATED WITH THE BREASTPLATE OF HUMAN SKULLS AND DRIED DEAD HANDS
302-123516-0009 WHICH SEEMED TO MARK ALL THE GREATER WARRIORS AMONG THE WARHOONS AS WELL AS TO INDICATE THEIR AWFUL FEROCITY WHICH GREATLY TRANSCENDS EVEN THAT OF THE THARKS THE JEDDAK BAR COMAS WHO WAS COMPARATIVELY YOUNG
302-123516-0010 WAS THE OBJECT OF THE FIERCE AND JEALOUS HATRED OF HIS OLD LIEUTENANT DAK KOVA THE JED WHO HAD CAPTURED ME AND I COULD NOT BUT NOTE THE ALMOST STUDIED EFFORTS WHICH THE LATTER MADE TO AFFRONT HIS SUPERIOR
302-123516-0011 HE ENTIRELY OMITTED THE USUAL FORMAL SALUTATION AS WE ENTERED THE PRESENCE OF THE JEDDAK AND AS HE PUSHED ME ROUGHLY BEFORE THE RULER HE EXCLAIMED IN A LOUD AND MENACING VOICE
302-123516-0012 I HAVE BROUGHT A STRANGE CREATURE WEARING THE METAL OF A THARK WHOM IT IS MY PLEASURE TO HAVE BATTLE WITH A WILD THOAT AT THE GREAT GAMES HE WILL DIE AS BAR COMAS YOUR JEDDAK SEES FIT IF AT ALL
302-123516-0013 WITH EMPHASIS AND DIGNITY IF AT ALL ROARED DAK KOVA BY THE DEAD HANDS AT MY THROAT BUT HE SHALL DIE BAR COMAS NO MAUDLIN WEAKNESS ON YOUR PART SHALL SAVE HIM
302-123516-0014 RATHER THAN BY A WATER HEARTED WEAKLING FROM WHOM EVEN OLD DAK KOVA COULD TEAR THE METAL WITH HIS BARE HANDS BAR COMAS EYED THE DEFIANT AND INSUBORDINATE CHIEFTAIN FOR AN INSTANT HIS EXPRESSION ONE OF HAUGHTY
302-123516-0015 FEARLESS CONTEMPT AND HATE AND THEN WITHOUT DRAWING A WEAPON AND WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD HE HURLED HIMSELF AT THE THROAT OF HIS DEFAMER
302-123516-0016 I NEVER BEFORE HAD SEEN TWO GREEN MARTIAN WARRIORS BATTLE WITH NATURE'S WEAPONS AND THE EXHIBITION OF ANIMAL FEROCITY WHICH ENSUED WAS AS FEARFUL A THING AS THE MOST DISORDERED IMAGINATION COULD PICTURE
302-123516-0017 BAR COMAS HAD MUCH THE BETTER OF THE BATTLE AS HE WAS STRONGER QUICKER AND MORE INTELLIGENT IT SOON SEEMED THAT THE ENCOUNTER WAS DONE SAVING ONLY THE FINAL DEATH THRUST WHEN BAR COMAS SLIPPED IN
302-123516-0018 BREAKING AWAY FROM A CLINCH IT WAS THE ONE LITTLE OPENING THAT DAK KOVA NEEDED AND HURLING HIMSELF AT THE BODY OF HIS ADVERSARY
302-123516-0019 AND WITH A LAST POWERFUL EFFORT RIPPED THE YOUNG JEDDAK WIDE OPEN THE FULL LENGTH OF HIS BODY THE GREAT TUSK
302-123516-0020 VICTOR AND VANQUISHED ROLLED LIMP AND LIFELESS UPON THE MOSS A HUGE MASS OF TORN AND BLOODY FLESH
302-123516-0021 BAR COMAS WAS STONE DEAD AND ONLY THE MOST HERCULEAN EFFORTS ON THE PART OF DAK KOVA'S FEMALES SAVED HIM FROM THE FATE HE DESERVED THREE DAYS LATER HE WALKED WITHOUT ASSISTANCE TO THE BODY OF BAR COMAS WHICH
302-123516-0022 BY CUSTOM HAD NOT BEEN MOVED FROM WHERE IT FELL AND PLACING HIS FOOT UPON THE NECK OF HIS ERSTWHILE RULER HE ASSUMED THE TITLE OF JEDDAK OF WARHOON
302-123516-0023 THE INJURIES TO DAK KOVA HAD DELAYED THE MARCH SO GREATLY THAT IT WAS DECIDED TO GIVE UP THE EXPEDITION WHICH WAS A RAID UPON A SMALL THARK COMMUNITY IN RETALIATION FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE INCUBATOR UNTIL AFTER THE GREAT GAMES
302-123516-0024 THEY ARE A SMALLER HORDE THAN THE THARKS BUT MUCH MORE FEROCIOUS
302-123516-0025 FOOD WAS BROUGHT ME AT INTERVALS BUT OWING TO THE UTTER DARKNESS OF THE PLACE I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER I LAY THERE DAYS OR WEEKS OR MONTHS IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE OF ALL MY LIFE
302-123516-0026 AND THAT MY MIND DID NOT GIVE WAY TO THE TERRORS OF THAT INKY BLACKNESS HAS BEEN A WONDER TO ME EVER SINCE THE PLACE WAS FILLED WITH CREEPING CRAWLING THINGS COLD SINUOUS BODIES PASSED OVER ME WHEN I LAY DOWN
302-123516-0027 AND IN THE DARKNESS I OCCASIONALLY CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF GLEAMING FIERY EYES FIXED IN HORRIBLE INTENTNESS UPON ME NO SOUND REACHED ME FROM THE WORLD ABOVE AND NO WORD WOULD MY JAILER VOUCHSAFE WHEN MY FOOD WAS BROUGHT TO ME
302-123516-0028 ALTHOUGH I AT FIRST BOMBARDED HIM WITH QUESTIONS FINALLY ALL THE HATRED AND MANIACAL LOATHING FOR THESE AWFUL CREATURES WHO HAD PLACED ME IN THIS HORRIBLE PLACE WAS CENTERED BY MY TOTTERING REASON UPON THIS SINGLE EMISSARY
302-123516-0029 WHO REPRESENTED TO ME THE ENTIRE HORDE OF WARHOONS I HAD NOTICED THAT HE ALWAYS ADVANCED WITH HIS DIM TORCH TO WHERE HE COULD PLACE THE FOOD WITHIN MY REACH AND AS HE STOOPED TO PLACE IT UPON THE FLOOR
302-123516-0030 SO WITH THE CUNNING OF A MADMAN I BACKED INTO THE FAR CORNER OF MY CELL WHEN NEXT I HEARD HIM APPROACHING
302-123516-0031 I WAITED HIS COMING CROUCHING LIKE SOME BEAST OF PREY AS HE STOOPED TO PLACE MY FOOD UPON THE GROUND I SWUNG THE CHAIN ABOVE MY HEAD AND CRASHED THE LINKS WITH ALL MY STRENGTH UPON HIS SKULL WITHOUT A SOUND
302-123516-0032 HE SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR STONE DEAD LAUGHING AND CHATTERING LIKE THE IDIOT I WAS FAST BECOMING
302-123516-0033 NO LONGER WAS I A JIBBERING IDIOT BUT A SANE REASONING MAN WITH THE MEANS OF ESCAPE WITHIN MY VERY HANDS AS I WAS GROPING TO REMOVE THE CHAIN FROM ABOUT MY VICTIM'S NECK
302-123516-0034 BACK INTO MY CORNER I CROUCHED
302-123516-0035 AND STEALTHILY ON CAME THE AWFUL EYES UNTIL THEY REACHED THE DEAD BODY AT MY FEET THEN SLOWLY THEY RETREATED BUT THIS TIME WITH A STRANGE GRATING SOUND
302-123523-0000 THE LOOTING OF ZODANGA AS THE GREAT GATE WHERE I STOOD SWUNG OPEN MY FIFTY THARKS HEADED BY TARS TARKAS HIMSELF RODE IN UPON THEIR MIGHTY THOATS I LED THEM TO THE PALACE WALLS
302-123523-0001 WHICH I NEGOTIATED EASILY WITHOUT ASSISTANCE ONCE INSIDE HOWEVER THE GATE GAVE ME CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE
302-123523-0002 AND SOON MY FIERCE ESCORT WAS RIDING ACROSS THE GARDENS OF THE JEDDAK OF ZODANGA AS WE APPROACHED THE PALACE I COULD SEE THROUGH THE GREAT WINDOWS OF THE FIRST FLOOR INTO THE BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED AUDIENCE CHAMBER OF THAN KOSIS
302-123523-0003 THE IMMENSE HALL WAS CROWDED WITH NOBLES AND THEIR WOMEN AS THOUGH SOME IMPORTANT FUNCTION WAS IN PROGRESS THERE WAS NOT A GUARD IN SIGHT WITHOUT THE PALACE DUE I PRESUME TO THE FACT THAT THE CITY AND PALACE WALLS WERE CONSIDERED IMPREGNABLE
302-123523-0004 AND SO I CAME CLOSE AND PEERED WITHIN AT ONE END OF THE CHAMBER UPON MASSIVE GOLDEN THRONES ENCRUSTED WITH DIAMONDS SAT THAN KOSIS AND HIS CONSORT
302-123523-0005 SURROUNDED BY OFFICERS AND DIGNITARIES OF STATE BEFORE THEM STRETCHED A BROAD AISLE LINED ON EITHER SIDE WITH SOLDIERY AND AS I LOOKED THERE ENTERED THIS AISLE AT THE FAR END OF THE HALL
302-123523-0006 THE HEAD OF A PROCESSION WHICH ADVANCED TO THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FIRST THERE MARCHED FOUR OFFICERS OF THE JEDDAK'S GUARD BEARING A HUGE SALVER ON WHICH REPOSED UPON A CUSHION OF SCARLET SILK
302-123523-0007 AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE THESE TWO PARTIES SEPARATED AND HALTED FACING EACH OTHER AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE AISLE THEN CAME MORE DIGNITARIES AND THE OFFICERS OF THE PALACE AND OF THE ARMY AND FINALLY
302-123523-0008 TWO FIGURES ENTIRELY MUFFLED IN SCARLET SILK SO THAT NOT A FEATURE OF EITHER WAS DISCERNIBLE THESE TWO STOPPED AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FACING THAN KOSIS WHEN THE BALANCE OF THE PROCESSION HAD ENTERED AND ASSUMED THEIR STATIONS
302-123523-0009 THAN KOSIS ADDRESSED THE COUPLE STANDING BEFORE HIM I COULD NOT HEAR HIS WORDS BUT PRESENTLY TWO OFFICERS ADVANCED AND REMOVED THE SCARLET ROBE FROM ONE OF THE FIGURES AND I SAW THAT KANTOS KAN HAD FAILED IN HIS MISSION
302-123523-0010 FOR IT WAS SAB THAN PRINCE OF ZODANGA WHO STOOD REVEALED BEFORE ME THAN KOSIS NOW TOOK A SET OF THE ORNAMENTS FROM ONE OF THE SALVERS AND PLACED ONE OF THE COLLARS OF GOLD ABOUT HIS SON'S NECK
302-123523-0011 SPRINGING THE PADLOCK FAST AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS ADDRESSED TO SAB THAN HE TURNED TO THE OTHER FIGURE FROM WHICH THE OFFICERS NOW REMOVED THE ENSHROUDING SILKS DISCLOSING TO MY NOW COMPREHENDING VIEW
302-123523-0012 BUT TO ME IT SEEMED THE MOST FIENDISH SIGHT I HAD EVER WITNESSED AND AS THE ORNAMENTS WERE ADJUSTED UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FIGURE AND HER COLLAR OF GOLD SWUNG OPEN IN THE HANDS OF THAN KOSIS I RAISED MY LONG SWORD ABOVE MY HEAD
302-123523-0013 I BROUGHT MY LONG SWORD DOWN UPON THE GOLDEN CHAIN THAT WOULD HAVE BOUND DEJAH THORIS TO ANOTHER IN AN INSTANT ALL WAS CONFUSION A THOUSAND DRAWN SWORDS MENACED ME FROM EVERY QUARTER
302-123523-0014 RODE TARS TARKAS AND HIS FIFTY WARRIORS ON THEIR GREAT THOATS A CRY OF ALARM AND AMAZEMENT BROKE FROM THE ASSEMBLAGE BUT NO WORD OF FEAR AND IN A MOMENT THE SOLDIERS AND NOBLES OF ZODANGA
302-123523-0015 WITH DRAWN LONG SWORD IN AN INSTANT WE WERE ENGAGED AND I FOUND NO MEAN ANTAGONIST AS WE CIRCLED UPON THE BROAD PLATFORM I SAW SAB THAN RUSHING UP THE STEPS TO AID HIS FATHER
302-123523-0016 BUT AS HE RAISED HIS HAND TO STRIKE DEJAH THORIS SPRANG BEFORE HIM AND THEN MY SWORD FOUND THE SPOT THAT MADE SAB THAN JEDDAK OF ZODANGA
302-123523-0017 AND AGAIN WE FACED EACH OTHER HE WAS SOON JOINED BY A QUARTET OF OFFICERS AND WITH MY BACK AGAINST A GOLDEN THRONE I FOUGHT ONCE AGAIN FOR DEJAH THORIS I WAS HARD PRESSED TO DEFEND MYSELF
302-123523-0018 AND WITH HIM MY LAST CHANCE TO WIN THE WOMAN I LOVED MY BLADE WAS SWINGING WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING AS I SOUGHT TO PARRY THE THRUSTS AND CUTS OF MY OPPONENTS TWO I HAD DISARMED AND ONE WAS DOWN
302-123523-0019 WHEN SEVERAL MORE RUSHED TO THE AID OF THEIR NEW RULER AND TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THE OLD AS THEY ADVANCED THERE WERE CRIES OF THE WOMAN THE WOMAN STRIKE HER DOWN IT IS HER PLOT KILL HER KILL HER
302-123523-0020 CALLING TO DEJAH THORIS TO GET BEHIND ME I WORKED MY WAY TOWARD THE LITTLE DOORWAY BACK OF THE THRONE BUT THE OFFICERS REALIZED MY INTENTIONS AND THREE OF THEM SPRANG IN BEHIND ME AND BLOCKED MY CHANCES FOR GAINING A POSITION
302-123523-0021 THE THARKS WERE HAVING THEIR HANDS FULL IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM
302-123523-0022 WHEN I SAW TARS TARKAS SURGING THROUGH THE CROWD OF PYGMIES THAT SWARMED ABOUT HIM WITH ONE SWING OF HIS MIGHTY LONGSWORD HE LAID A DOZEN CORPSES AT HIS FEET
302-123523-0023 NOT ONE ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE AND WHEN THE FIGHTING CEASED IT WAS BECAUSE ONLY THARKS REMAINED ALIVE IN THE GREAT HALL OTHER THAN DEJAH THORIS AND MYSELF SAB THAN LAY DEAD BESIDE HIS FATHER
302-123523-0024 AND THE CORPSES OF THE FLOWER OF ZODANGAN NOBILITY AND CHIVALRY COVERED THE FLOOR OF THE BLOODY SHAMBLES MY FIRST THOUGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER WAS FOR KANTOS KAN
302-123523-0025 AND LEAVING DEJAH THORIS IN CHARGE OF TARS TARKAS I TOOK A DOZEN WARRIORS AND HASTENED TO THE DUNGEONS BENEATH THE PALACE THE JAILERS HAD ALL LEFT TO JOIN THE FIGHTERS IN THE THRONE ROOM SO WE SEARCHED THE LABYRINTHINE PRISON WITHOUT OPPOSITION
302-123523-0026 I CALLED KANTOS KAN'S NAME ALOUD IN EACH NEW CORRIDOR AND COMPARTMENT AND FINALLY I WAS REWARDED BY HEARING A FAINT RESPONSE GUIDED BY THE SOUND WE SOON FOUND HIM HELPLESS IN A DARK RECESS
302-123523-0027 HE WAS OVERJOYED AT SEEING ME AND TO KNOW THE MEANING OF THE FIGHT FAINT ECHOES OF WHICH HAD REACHED HIS PRISON CELL HE TOLD ME THAT THE AIR PATROL HAD CAPTURED HIM BEFORE HE REACHED THE HIGH TOWER OF THE PALACE
302-123523-0028 SO THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN SEEN SAB THAN WE DISCOVERED THAT IT WOULD BE FUTILE TO ATTEMPT TO CUT AWAY THE BARS AND CHAINS WHICH HELD HIM PRISONER SO AT HIS SUGGESTION
302-123523-0029 FORTUNATELY AMONG THE FIRST I EXAMINED I FOUND HIS JAILER AND SOON WE HAD KANTOS KAN WITH US IN THE THRONE ROOM THE SOUNDS OF HEAVY FIRING MINGLED WITH SHOUTS AND CRIES CAME TO US FROM THE CITY'S STREETS
302-123523-0030 AND TARS TARKAS HASTENED AWAY TO DIRECT THE FIGHTING WITHOUT KANTOS KAN ACCOMPANIED HIM TO ACT AS GUIDE THE GREEN WARRIORS COMMENCING A THOROUGH SEARCH OF THE PALACE FOR OTHER ZODANGANS AND FOR LOOT AND DEJAH THORIS AND I WERE LEFT ALONE
302-123523-0031 CAN IT BE THAT ALL EARTH MEN ARE AS YOU ALONE A STRANGER HUNTED THREATENED PERSECUTED YOU HAVE DONE IN A FEW SHORT MONTHS WHAT IN ALL THE PAST AGES OF BARSOOM NO MAN HAS EVER DONE
302-123523-0032 JOINED TOGETHER THE WILD HORDES OF THE SEA BOTTOMS AND BROUGHT THEM TO FIGHT AS ALLIES OF A RED MARTIAN PEOPLE THE ANSWER IS EASY DEJAH THORIS I REPLIED SMILING IT WAS NOT I WHO DID IT IT WAS LOVE
302-123523-0033 LOVE FOR DEJAH THORIS A POWER THAT WOULD WORK GREATER MIRACLES THAN THIS YOU HAVE SEEN A PRETTY FLUSH OVERSPREAD HER FACE AND SHE ANSWERED YOU MAY SAY THAT NOW JOHN CARTER AND I MAY LISTEN
302-123523-0034 FOR I AM FREE AND MORE STILL I HAVE TO SAY ERE IT IS AGAIN TOO LATE I RETURNED I HAVE DONE MANY STRANGE THINGS IN MY LIFE MANY THINGS THAT WISER MEN WOULD NOT HAVE DARED
302-123523-0035 BUT NEVER IN MY WILDEST FANCIES HAVE I DREAMED OF WINNING A DEJAH THORIS FOR MYSELF FOR NEVER HAD I DREAMED THAT IN ALL THE UNIVERSE DWELT SUCH A WOMAN AS THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM
302-123523-0036 BUT THAT YOU ARE YOU IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ME DOUBT MY SANITY AS I ASK YOU MY PRINCESS TO BE MINE HE DOES NOT NEED TO BE ABASHED WHO SO WELL KNEW THE ANSWER TO HIS PLEA
302-123523-0037 BEFORE THE PLEA WERE MADE SHE REPLIED RISING AND PLACING HER DEAR HANDS UPON MY SHOULDERS AND SO I TOOK HER IN MY ARMS AND KISSED HER AND THUS IN THE MIDST OF A CITY OF WILD CONFLICT FILLED WITH THE ALARMS OF WAR
302-123523-0038 WITH DEATH AND DESTRUCTION REAPING THEIR TERRIBLE HARVEST AROUND HER DID DEJAH THORIS PRINCESS OF HELIUM TRUE DAUGHTER OF MARS THE GOD OF WAR PROMISE HERSELF IN MARRIAGE TO JOHN CARTER
307-127535-0000 THE COUNCIL OF BUCCANEERS HAD LASTED SOME TIME WHEN ONE OF THEM RE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND WITH A REPETITION OF THE SAME SALUTE WHICH HAD IN MY EYES AN IRONICAL AIR BEGGED FOR A MOMENT'S LOAN OF THE TORCH SILVER BRIEFLY AGREED
307-127535-0001 AND THIS EMISSARY RETIRED AGAIN LEAVING US TOGETHER IN THE DARK THERE'S A BREEZE COMING JIM SAID SILVER WHO HAD BY THIS TIME ADOPTED QUITE A FRIENDLY AND FAMILIAR TONE I TURNED TO THE LOOPHOLE NEAREST ME AND LOOKED OUT
307-127535-0002 THE EMBERS OF THE GREAT FIRE HAD SO FAR BURNED THEMSELVES OUT AND NOW GLOWED SO LOW AND DUSKILY THAT I UNDERSTOOD WHY THESE CONSPIRATORS DESIRED A TORCH ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN THE SLOPE TO THE STOCKADE THEY WERE COLLECTED IN A GROUP
307-127535-0003 ONE HELD THE LIGHT ANOTHER WAS ON HIS KNEES IN THEIR MIDST AND I SAW THE BLADE OF AN OPEN KNIFE SHINE IN HIS HAND WITH VARYING COLOURS IN THE MOON AND TORCHLIGHT
307-127535-0004 I COULD JUST MAKE OUT THAT HE HAD A BOOK AS WELL AS A KNIFE IN HIS HAND AND WAS STILL WONDERING HOW ANYTHING SO INCONGRUOUS HAD COME IN THEIR POSSESSION WHEN THE KNEELING FIGURE ROSE ONCE MORE TO HIS FEET

307-127535-0040 ONE SIDE WAS BLANK FOR IT HAD BEEN THE LAST LEAF THE OTHER CONTAINED A VERSE OR TWO OF REVELATION THESE WORDS AMONG THE REST WHICH STRUCK SHARPLY HOME UPON MY MIND WITHOUT ARE DOGS AND MURDERERS
307-127535-0041 THE PRINTED SIDE HAD BEEN BLACKENED WITH WOOD ASH WHICH ALREADY BEGAN TO COME OFF AND SOIL MY FINGERS ON THE BLANK SIDE HAD BEEN WRITTEN WITH THE SAME MATERIAL THE ONE WORD DEPPOSED
307-127535-0042 I HAVE THAT CURIOSITY BESIDE ME AT THIS MOMENT BUT NOT A TRACE OF WRITING NOW REMAINS BEYOND A SINGLE SCRATCH SUCH AS A MAN MIGHT MAKE WITH HIS THUMB NAIL THAT WAS THE END OF THE NIGHT'S BUSINESS
307-127535-0043 IT WAS LONG ERE I COULD CLOSE AN EYE AND HEAVEN KNOWS I HAD MATTER ENOUGH FOR THOUGHT IN THE MAN WHOM I HAD SLAIN THAT AFTERNOON
307-127535-0044 AND ABOVE ALL IN THE REMARKABLE GAME THAT I SAW SILVER NOW ENGAGED UPON KEEPING THE MUTINEERS TOGETHER WITH ONE HAND AND GRASPING WITH THE OTHER AFTER EVERY MEANS POSSIBLE AND IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE HIS PEACE AND SAVE HIS MISERABLE LIFE
307-127535-0045 HE HIMSELF SLEPT PEACEFULLY AND SNORED ALOUD YET
307-127539-0000 THERE NEVER WAS SUCH AN OVERTURN IN THIS WORLD EACH OF THESE SIX MEN WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN STRUCK
307-127539-0001 EVERY THOUGHT OF HIS SOUL HAD BEEN SET FULL STRETCH LIKE A RACER ON THAT MONEY WELL HE WAS BROUGHT UP IN A SINGLE SECOND DEAD AND HE KEPT HIS HEAD FOUND HIS TEMPER AND CHANGED HIS PLAN BEFORE THE OTHERS HAD HAD TIME TO REALIZE THE DISAPPOINTMENT
307-127539-0002 HERE IS A NARROW CORNER AS
307-127539-0003 HIS LOOKS WERE NOT QUITE FRIENDLY AND I WAS SO REVOLTED AT THESE CONSTANT CHANGES THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR WHISPERING SO YOU'VE CHANGED SIDES AGAIN THERE WAS NO TIME LEFT FOR HIM TO ANSWER IN
307-127539-0004 AND TO DIG WITH THEIR FINGERS THROWING THE BOARDS ASIDE AS THEY DID SO MORGAN FOUND A PIECE OF GOLD HE HELD IT UP WITH A PERFECT SPOUT OF OATHS IT WAS A TWO GUINEA PIECE AND IT WENT FROM HAND TO HAND AMONG THEM FOR A QUARTER OF A MINUTE
307-127539-0005 TWO GUINEAS ROARED MERRY SHAKING IT AT SILVER

307-127539-0008 DARTING FURIOUS GLANCES BEHIND THEM ONE THING I OBSERVED WHICH LOOKED WELL FOR US THEY ALL GOT OUT UPON THE OPPOSITE SIDE FROM SILVER WELL THERE WE STOOD TWO ON ONE SIDE FIVE ON THE OTHER THE PIT BETWEEN US
307-127539-0009 AND NOBODY SCREWED UP HIGH ENOUGH TO OFFER THE FIRST BLOW SILVER NEVER MOVED HE WATCHED THEM VERY UPRIGHT ON HIS CRUTCH AND LOOKED AS COOL AS EVER I SAW HIM HE WAS BRAVE AND NO MISTAKE
307-127539-0010 AT LAST MERRY SEEMED TO THINK A SPEECH MIGHT HELP MATTERS
307-127539-0011 ONE'S THE OLD CRIPPLE THAT BROUGHT US ALL HERE AND BLUNDERED US DOWN TO THIS THE OTHER'S THAT CUB THAT I MEAN TO HAVE THE HEART OF NOW MATES
307-127539-0012 AND PLAINLY MEANT TO LEAD A CHARGE BUT JUST THEN CRACK CRACK CRACK THREE MUSKET SHOTS FLASHED OUT OF THE THICKET MERRY TUMBLED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE EXCAVATION
307-127539-0013 THE MAN WITH THE BANDAGE SPUN ROUND LIKE A TEETOTUM AND FELL ALL HIS LENGTH UPON HIS SIDE WHERE HE LAY DEAD BUT STILL TWITCHING AND THE OTHER THREE TURNED AND RAN FOR IT WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
307-127539-0014 BEFORE YOU COULD WINK LONG JOHN HAD FIRED TWO BARRELS OF A PISTOL INTO THE STRUGGLING MERRY AND AS THE MAN ROLLED UP HIS EYES AT HIM IN THE LAST AGONY GEORGE SAID HE
307-127539-0015 SOMETIMES PLUNGING THROUGH THE BUSHES TO THE CHEST I TELL YOU BUT SILVER WAS ANXIOUS TO KEEP UP WITH US THE WORK THAT MAN WENT THROUGH
307-127539-0016 WAS WORK NO SOUND MAN EVER EQUALLED AND SO THINKS THE DOCTOR AS IT WAS HE WAS ALREADY THIRTY YARDS BEHIND US AND ON THE VERGE OF STRANGLING WHEN WE REACHED THE BROW OF THE SLOPE DOCTOR HE HAILED SEE THERE
307-127539-0017 NO HURRY SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS NO HURRY IN A MORE OPEN PART OF THE PLATEAU WE COULD SEE THE THREE SURVIVORS STILL RUNNING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THEY HAD STARTED
307-127539-0018 WE WERE ALREADY BETWEEN THEM AND THE BOATS
307-127539-0019 CAME SLOWLY UP WITH US THANK YE KINDLY DOCTOR SAYS HE YOU CAME IN IN ABOUT THE NICK I GUESS FOR ME AND HAWKINS
307-127539-0020 I'M BEN GUNN I AM REPLIED THE MAROON WRIGGLING LIKE AN EEL IN HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND HE ADDED AFTER A LONG PAUSE HOW DO MISTER SILVER PRETTY WELL I THANK YE SAYS YOU
307-127539-0021 BEN BEN MURMURED SILVER TO THINK AS YOU'VE DONE ME THE DOCTOR SENT BACK GRAY FOR ONE OF THE PICK AXES DESERTED IN THEIR FLIGHT BY THE MUTINEERS
307-127539-0022 BEN IN HIS LONG LONELY WANDERINGS ABOUT THE ISLAND HAD FOUND THE SKELETON IT WAS HE THAT HAD RIFLED IT HE HAD FOUND THE TREASURE HE HAD DUG IT UP IT WAS THE HAFT OF HIS PICK AXE THAT LAY BROKEN IN THE EXCAVATION
307-127539-0023 HE HAD CARRIED IT ON HIS BACK IN MANY WEARY JOURNEYS FROM THE FOOT OF THE TALL PINE TO A CAVE HE HAD ON THE TWO POINTED HILL AT THE NORTH EAST ANGLE OF THE ISLAND AND THERE IT HAD LAIN STORED IN SAFETY SINCE TWO MONTHS
307-127539-0024 GIVEN HIM THE STORES FOR BEN GUNN'S CAVE WAS WELL SUPPLIED WITH GOATS MEAT SALTED BY HIMSELF GIVEN ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING TO GET A CHANCE OF MOVING IN SAFETY FROM THE STOCKADE TO THE TWO POINTED HILL THERE TO BE CLEAR OF MALARIA
307-127539-0025 AND KEEP A GUARD UPON THE MONEY AS FOR YOU JIM HE SAID IT WENT AGAINST MY HEART
307-127539-0026 AND LEAVING THE SQUIRE TO GUARD THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN GRAY AND THE MAROON AND STARTED MAKING THE DIAGONAL ACROSS THE ISLAND TO BE AT HAND BESIDE THE PINE SOON HOWEVER HE SAW THAT OUR PARTY HAD THE START OF HIM AND BEN GUNN BEING FLEET OF FOOT
307-127539-0027 HAD BEEN DISPATCHED IN FRONT TO DO HIS BEST ALONE THEN IT HAD OCCURRED TO HIM TO WORK UPON THE SUPERSTITIONS OF HIS FORMER SHIPMATES
307-127539-0028 NOT A THOUGHT REPLIED DOCTOR LIVESEY CHEERILY AND BY THIS TIME WE HAD REACHED THE GIGS
307-127539-0029 THIS WAS A RUN OF EIGHT OR NINE MILES SILVER THOUGH HE WAS ALMOST KILLED ALREADY WITH FATIGUE WAS SET TO AN OAR LIKE THE REST OF US AND WE WERE SOON SKIMMING SWIFTLY OVER A SMOOTH SEA
307-127539-0030 AND A FIGURE STANDING BY IT LEANING ON A MUSKET IT WAS THE SQUIRE AND WE WAVED A HANDKERCHIEF AND GAVE HIM THREE CHEERS IN WHICH THE VOICE OF SILVER JOINED AS HEARTILY AS ANY THREE MILES FARTHER JUST INSIDE THE MOUTH OF NORTH INLET
307-127539-0031 WHAT SHOULD WE MEET BUT THE HISPANIOLA CRUISING BY HERSELF THE LAST FLOOD HAD LIFTED HER AND HAD THERE BEEN MUCH WIND OR A STRONG TIDE CURRENT AS IN THE SOUTHERN ANCHORAGE WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE FOUND HER MORE OR FOUND HER STRANDED BEYOND HELP
307-127539-0032 ANOTHER ANCHOR WAS GOT READY AND DROPPED IN A FATHOM AND A HALF OF WATER WE ALL PULLED ROUND AGAIN TO RUM COVE THE NEAREST POINT FOR BEN GUNN'S TREASURE HOUSE AND THEN GRAY SINGLE HANDED RETURNED WITH THE GIG TO THE HISPANIOLA
307-127539-0033 WHERE HE WAS TO PASS THE NIGHT ON GUARD A GENTLE SLOPE RAN UP FROM THE BEACH TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE CAVE AT THE TOP THE SQUIRE MET US
307-127539-0034 TO ME HE WAS CORDIAL AND KIND SAYING NOTHING OF MY ESCAPADE EITHER IN THE WAY OF BLAME OR PRAISE AT SILVER'S POLITE SALUTE HE SOMEWHAT FLUSHED JOHN SILVER
307-127539-0035 REPLIED LONG JOHN AGAIN SALUTING I DARE YOU TO THANK ME CRIED THE SQUIRE IT IS A GROSS DERELICTION OF MY DUTY STAND BACK AND THEREUPON WE ALL ENTERED THE CAVE
307-127539-0036 IT WAS A LARGE AIRY PLACE WITH A LITTLE SPRING AND A POOL OF CLEAR WATER OVERHUNG WITH FERNS THE FLOOR WAS SAND BEFORE A BIG FIRE LAY CAPTAIN SMOLLETT AND IN A FAR CORNER ONLY DUSKILY FLICKERED OVER BY THE BLAZE
307-127539-0037 I BEHELD GREAT HEAPS OF COIN AND QUADRILATERALS BUILT OF BARS OF GOLD THAT WAS FLINT'S TREASURE THAT WE HAD COME SO FAR TO SEEK AND THAT HAD COST ALREADY THE LIVES OF SEVENTEEN MEN FROM THE HISPANIOLA
307-127539-0038 HOW MANY IT HAD COST IN THE AMASSING WHAT BLOOD AND SORROW WHAT GOOD SHIPS SCUTTLED ON THE DEEP WHAT BRAVE MEN WALKING THE PLANK BLINDFOLD WHAT SHOT OF CANNON WHAT SHAME AND LIES AND CRUELTY
307-127539-0039 PERHAPS NO MAN ALIVE COULD TELL YET THERE WERE STILL THREE UPON THAT ISLAND SILVER AND OLD MORGAN AND BEN GUNN WHO HAD EACH TAKEN HIS SHARE IN THESE CRIMES AS EACH HAD HOPED IN VAIN TO SHARE IN THE REWARD
307-127539-0040 COME IN JIM SAID THE CAPTAIN YOU'RE A GOOD BOY IN YOUR LINE JIM BUT I DON'T THINK YOU AND ME'LL GO TO SEA AGAIN YOU'RE TOO MUCH OF THE BORN FAVOURITE FOR ME
307-127539-0041 AND WHAT A MEAL IT WAS WITH BEN GUNN'S SALTED GOAT AND SOME DELICACIES AND A BOTTLE OF OLD WINE FROM THE HISPANIOLA NEVER I AM SURE WERE PEOPLE GAYER OR HAPPIER
307-127540-0000 THE THREE FELLOWS STILL ABROAD UPON THE ISLAND DID NOT GREATLY TROUBLE US A SINGLE SENTRY ON THE SHOULDER OF THE HILL WAS SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE US AGAINST ANY SUDDEN ONSLAUGHT AND WE THOUGHT BESIDES THEY HAD HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH OF FIGHTING
307-127540-0001 THEREFORE THE WORK WAS PUSHED ON BRISKLY GRAY AND BEN GUNN CAME AND WENT WITH THE BOAT WHILE THE REST DURING THEIR ABSENCES
307-127540-0002 TWO OF THE BARS SLUNG IN A ROPE'S END MADE A GOOD LOAD FOR A GROWN MAN ONE THAT HE WAS GLAD TO WALK SLOWLY WITH FOR MY PART
307-127540-0003 THE PICTURES OF ALL THE KINGS OF EUROPE FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS STRANGE ORIENTAL PIECES STAMPED WITH WHAT LOOKED LIKE WISPS OF STRING OR BITS OF SPIDER'S WEB
307-127540-0004 NEARLY EVERY VARIETY OF MONEY IN THE WORLD MUST I THINK HAVE FOUND A PLACE IN THAT COLLECTION AND FOR NUMBER I AM SURE THEY WERE LIKE AUTUMN LEAVES SO THAT MY BACK ACHED WITH STOOPING AND MY FINGERS WITH SORTING THEM OUT
307-127540-0005 AT LAST I THINK IT WAS ON THE THIRD NIGHT THE DOCTOR AND I WERE STROLLING ON THE SHOULDER OF THE HILL WHERE IT OVERLOOKS THE LOWLANDS OF THE ISLE
307-127540-0006 THE WIND BROUGHT US A NOISE BETWEEN SHRIEKING AND SINGING IT WAS ONLY A SNATCH THAT REACHED OUR EARS FOLLOWED BY THE FORMER SILENCE HEAVEN FORGIVE THEM SAID THE DOCTOR TIS THE MUTINEERS
307-127540-0007 ALL DRUNK SIR STRUCK IN THE VOICE OF SILVER FROM BEHIND US SILVER I SHOULD SAY WAS ALLOWED HIS ENTIRE LIBERTY AND IN SPITE OF DAILY REBUFFS SEEMED TO REGARD HIMSELF ONCE MORE AS QUITE A PRIVILEGED AND FRIENDLY DEPENDENT
307-127540-0008 INDEED IT WAS REMARKABLE HOW WELL HE BORE THESE SLIGHTS AND WITH WHAT UNWEARYING POLITENESS HE KEPT ON TRYING TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH ALL YET I THINK NONE TREATED HIM BETTER THAN A DOG UNLESS IT WAS BEN GUNN
307-127540-0009 WHO WAS STILL TERRIBLY AFRAID OF HIS OLD QUARTERMASTER OR MYSELF WHO HAD REALLY SOMETHING TO THANK HIM FOR ALTHOUGH FOR THAT MATTER I SUPPOSE I HAD REASON TO THINK EVEN WORSE OF HIM THAN ANYBODY ELSE
307-127540-0010 FOR I HAD SEEN HIM MEDITATING A FRESH TREACHERY UPON THE PLATEAU ACCORDINGLY IT WAS PRETTY GRUFFLY THAT THE DOCTOR ANSWERED HIM DRUNK OR RAVING SAID HE RIGHT YOU WERE SIR REPLIED SILVER
307-127540-0011 AND PRECIOUS LITTLE ODDS WHICH TO YOU AND ME I SUPPOSE YOU WOULD HARDLY ASK ME TO CALL YOU A HUMANE MAN RETURNED THE DOCTOR WITH A SNEER AND SO MY FEELINGS MAY SURPRISE YOU MASTER SILVER
307-127540-0012 BUT IF I WERE SURE THEY WERE RAVING AS I AM MORALLY CERTAIN ONE AT LEAST OF THEM IS DOWN WITH FEVER I SHOULD LEAVE THIS CAMP AND AT WHATEVER RISK TO MY OWN CARCASS TAKE THEM THE ASSISTANCE OF MY SKILL
307-127540-0013 NO SAID THE DOCTOR YOU'RE THE MAN TO KEEP YOUR WORD WE KNOW THAT WELL THAT WAS ABOUT THE LAST NEWS WE HAD OF THE THREE PIRATES ONLY ONCE WE HEARD A GUNSHOT A GREAT WAY OFF AND SUPPOSED THEM TO BE HUNTING
307-127540-0014 A COUNCIL WAS HELD AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT WE MUST DESERT THEM ON THE ISLAND TO THE HUGE GLEE I MUST SAY OF BEN GUNN AND WITH THE STRONG APPROVAL OF GRAY WE LEFT A GOOD STOCK OF POWDER AND SHOT THE BULK OF THE SALT GOAT
307-127540-0015 A FEW MEDICINES AND SOME OTHER NECESSARIES TOOLS CLOTHING A SPARE SAIL A FATHOM OR TWO OF ROPE AND BY THE PARTICULAR DESIRE OF THE DOCTOR A HANDSOME PRESENT OF TOBACCO THAT WAS ABOUT OUR LAST DOING ON THE ISLAND
307-127540-0016 AND THERE WE SAW ALL THREE OF THEM KNEELING TOGETHER ON A SPIT OF SAND WITH THEIR ARMS RAISED IN SUPPLICATION IT WENT TO ALL OUR HEARTS I THINK TO LEAVE THEM IN THAT WRETCHED STATE BUT WE COULD NOT RISK ANOTHER MUTINY
307-127540-0017 AND TO TAKE THEM HOME FOR THE GIBBET WOULD HAVE BEEN A CRUEL SORT OF KINDNESS THE DOCTOR HAILED THEM AND TOLD THEM OF THE STORES WE HAD LEFT AND WHERE THEY WERE TO FIND THEM BUT THEY CONTINUED TO CALL US BY NAME AND APPEAL TO US FOR GOD'S SAKE
307-127540-0018 LEAPT TO HIS FEET WITH A HOARSE CRY WHIPPED HIS MUSKET TO HIS SHOULDER AND SENT A SHOT WHISTLING OVER SILVER'S HEAD
307-127540-0019 AFTER THAT WE KEPT UNDER COVER OF THE BULWARKS AND WHEN NEXT I LOOKED OUT THEY HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE SPIT AND THE SPIT ITSELF HAD ALMOST MELTED OUT OF SIGHT IN THE GROWING DISTANCE THAT WAS AT LEAST THE END OF THAT
307-127540-0020 AND BEFORE NOON TO MY INEXPRESSIBLE JOY THE HIGHEST ROCK OF TREASURE ISLAND HAD SUNK INTO THE BLUE ROUND OF SEA WE WERE SO SHORT OF MEN THAT EVERYONE ON BOARD HAD TO BEAR A HAND
307-127540-0021 ONLY THE CAPTAIN LYING ON A MATTRESS IN THE STERN AND GIVING HIS ORDERS FOR THOUGH GREATLY RECOVERED HE WAS STILL IN WANT OF QUIET WE LAID HER HEAD FOR THE NEAREST PORT IN SPANISH AMERICA FOR WE COULD NOT RISK THE VOYAGE HOME WITHOUT FRESH HANDS
307-127540-0022 AND AS IT WAS WHAT WITH BAFFLING WINDS AND A COUPLE OF FRESH GALES WE WERE ALL WORN OUT BEFORE WE REACHED IT IT WAS JUST AT SUNDOWN WHEN WE CAST ANCHOR IN A MOST BEAUTIFUL LAND LOCKED GULF
307-127540-0023 THE TASTE OF THE TROPICAL FRUITS AND ABOVE ALL THE LIGHTS THAT BEGAN TO SHINE IN THE TOWN MADE A MOST CHARMING CONTRAST TO OUR DARK AND BLOODY SOJOURN ON THE ISLAND AND THE DOCTOR AND THE SQUIRE TAKING ME ALONG WITH THEM WENT ASHORE
307-127540-0024 TO PASS THE EARLY PART OF THE NIGHT HERE THEY MET THE CAPTAIN OF AN ENGLISH MAN OF WAR FELL IN TALK WITH HIM WENT ON BOARD HIS SHIP AND IN SHORT HAD SO AGREEABLE A TIME THAT DAY WAS BREAKING WHEN WE CAME ALONGSIDE THE HISPANIOLA
307-127540-0025 SILVER WAS GONE THE MAROON HAD CONNIVED AT HIS ESCAPE IN A SHORE BOAT SOME HOURS AGO
307-127540-0026 THAT MAN WITH THE ONE LEG HAD STAYED ABOARD BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL THE SEA COOK HAD NOT GONE EMPTY HANDED HE HAD CUT THROUGH A BULKHEAD UNOBSERVED AND HAD REMOVED ONE OF THE SACKS OF COIN
307-127540-0027 WORTH PERHAPS THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED GUINEAS TO HELP HIM ON HIS FURTHER WANDERINGS I THINK WE WERE ALL PLEASED TO BE SO CHEAPLY QUIT OF HIM
307-127540-0028 WELL TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT WE GOT A FEW HANDS ON BOARD MADE A GOOD CRUISE HOME AND THE HISPANIOLA REACHED BRISTOL JUST AS MISTER BLANDLY WAS BEGINNING TO THINK OF FITTING OUT HER CONSORT FIVE MEN ONLY OF THOSE WHO HAD SAILED RETURNED WITH HER
307-127540-0029 AS THAT OTHER SHIP THEY SANG ABOUT WITH ONE MAN OF HER CREW ALIVE WHAT PUT TO SEA WITH SEVENTY FIVE ALL OF US HAD AN AMPLE SHARE OF THE TREASURE AND USED IT WISELY OR FOOLISHLY ACCORDING TO OUR NATURES
307-127540-0030 CAPTAIN SMOLLETT IS NOW RETIRED FROM THE SEA GRAY NOT ONLY SAVED HIS MONEY BUT BEING SUDDENLY SMIT WITH THE DESIRE TO RISE ALSO STUDIED HIS PROFESSION AND HE IS NOW MATE AND PART OWNER OF A FINE FULL RIGGED SHIP
307-127540-0031 MARRIED BESIDES AND THE FATHER OF A FAMILY AS FOR BEN GUNN HE GOT A THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH HE SPENT OR LOST IN THREE WEEKS OR TO BE MORE EXACT IN NINETEEN DAYS FOR HE WAS BACK BEGGING ON THE TWENTIETH
307-127540-0032 OF SILVER WE HAVE HEARD NO MORE THAT FORMIDABLE SEAFARING MAN WITH ONE LEG HAS AT LAST GONE CLEAN OUT OF MY LIFE
307-127540-0033 AND PERHAPS STILL LIVES IN COMFORT WITH HER AND CAPTAIN FLINT IT IS TO BE HOPED SO I SUPPOSE FOR HIS CHANCES OF COMFORT IN ANOTHER WORLD ARE VERY SMALL THE BAR SILVER
307-127540-0034 AND THE ARMS STILL LIE FOR ALL THAT I KNOW WHERE FLINT BURIED THEM AND CERTAINLY THEY SHALL LIE THERE FOR ME
307-127540-0035 AND THE WORST DREAMS THAT EVER I HAVE ARE WHEN I HEAR THE SURF BOOMING ABOUT ITS COASTS OR START UPRIGHT IN BED WITH THE SHARP VOICE OF CAPTAIN FLINT STILL RINGING IN MY EARS
311-124404-0000 I WOULD HERE WILLINGLY HAVE PROCEEDED TO EXHIBIT THE WHOLE CHAIN OF TRUTHS WHICH I DEDUCED FROM THESE PRIMARY BUT AS WITH A VIEW TO THIS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY NOW TO TREAT OF MANY QUESTIONS
311-124404-0001 I BELIEVE THAT IT WILL BE BETTER FOR ME TO REFRAIN FROM THIS EXPOSITION AND ONLY MENTION IN GENERAL WHAT THESE TRUTHS ARE THAT THE MORE JUDICIOUS MAY BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER A MORE SPECIAL ACCOUNT OF THEM WOULD CONDUCE TO THE PUBLIC ADVANTAGE
311-124404-0002 I HAVE EVER REMAINED FIRM IN MY ORIGINAL RESOLUTION TO SUPPOSE NO OTHER PRINCIPLE THAN THAT OF WHICH I HAVE RECENTLY AVAILED MYSELF IN DEMONSTRATING THE EXISTENCE OF GOD AND OF THE SOUL
311-124404-0003 AND TO ACCEPT AS TRUE NOTHING THAT DID NOT APPEAR TO ME MORE CLEAR AND CERTAIN THAN THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE GEOMETERS HAD FORMERLY APPEARED AND YET I VENTURE TO STATE THAT NOT ONLY HAVE I FOUND MEANS
311-124404-0004 TO SATISFY MYSELF IN A SHORT TIME ON ALL THE PRINCIPAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH ARE USUALLY TREATED OF IN PHILOSOPHY BUT I HAVE ALSO OBSERVED CERTAIN LAWS ESTABLISHED IN NATURE BY GOD IN SUCH A MANNER
311-124404-0005 AND OF WHICH HE HAS IMPRESSED ON OUR MINDS SUCH NOTIONS THAT AFTER WE HAVE REFLECTED SUFFICIENTLY UPON THESE WE CANNOT DOUBT THAT THEY ARE ACCURATELY OBSERVED IN ALL THAT EXISTS OR TAKES PLACE IN THE WORLD AND FARTHER BY CONSIDERING
311-124404-0006 BUT LIKE THE PAINTERS WHO FINDING THEMSELVES UNABLE TO REPRESENT EQUALLY WELL ON A PLAIN SURFACE ALL THE DIFFERENT FACES OF A SOLID BODY SELECT ONE OF THE CHIEF ON WHICH ALONE THEY MAKE THE LIGHT FALL AND THROWING THE REST INTO THE SHADE
311-124404-0007 FEARING LEST I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO COMPENSE IN MY DISCOURSE ALL THAT WAS IN MY MIND I RESOLVED TO EXPOUND SINGLY THOUGH AT CONSIDERABLE LENGTH MY OPINIONS REGARDING LIGHT THEN
311-124404-0008 TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF ADDING SOMETHING ON THE SUN AND THE FIXED STARS SINCE LIGHT ALMOST WHOLLY PROCEEDS FROM THEM ON THE HEAVENS SINCE THEY TRANSMIT IT ON THE PLANETS COMETS AND EARTH SINCE THEY REFLECT IT AND PARTICULARLY
311-124404-0009 ON ALL THE BODIES THAT ARE UPON THE EARTH SINCE THEY ARE EITHER COLORED OR TRANSPARENT OR LUMINOUS AND FINALLY ON MAN SINCE HE IS THE SPECTATOR OF THESE OBJECTS
311-124404-0010 FURTHER TO ENABLE ME TO CAST THIS VARIETY OF SUBJECTS SOMEWHAT INTO THE SHADE AND TO EXPRESS MY JUDGMENT REGARDING THEM WITH GREATER FREEDOM WITHOUT BEING NECESSITATED TO ADOPT OR REFUTE THE OPINIONS OF THE LEARNED
311-124404-0011 I RESOLVED TO LEAVE ALL THE PEOPLE HERE TO THEIR DISPUTES AND TO SPEAK ONLY OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN A NEW WORLD IF GOD WERE NOW TO CREATE SOMEWHERE IN THE IMAGINARY SPACES
311-124404-0012 MATTER SUFFICIENT TO COMPOSE ONE AND WERE TO AGITATE VARIOUSLY AND CONFUSEDLY THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THIS MATTER SO THAT THERE RESULTED A CHAOS AS DISORDERED AS THE POETS EVER FEIGNED
311-124404-0013 AND AFTER THAT DID NOTHING MORE THAN LEND HIS ORDINARY CONCURRENCE TO NATURE AND ALLOW HER TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS WHICH HE HAD ESTABLISHED ON THIS SUPPOSITION I IN THE FIRST PLACE DESCRIBED THIS MATTER
311-124404-0014 AND ESSAYED TO REPRESENT IT IN SUCH A MANNER THAT TO MY MIND THERE CAN BE NOTHING CLEARER AND MORE INTELLIGIBLE EXCEPT WHAT HAS BEEN RECENTLY SAID REGARDING GOD AND THE SOUL
311-124404-0015 FOR I EVEN EXPRESSLY SUPPOSED THAT IT POSSESSED NONE OF THOSE FORMS OR QUALITIES WHICH ARE SO DEBATED IN THE SCHOOLS NOR IN GENERAL ANYTHING THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH IS NOT SO NATURAL TO OUR MINDS
311-124404-0016 I ENDEAVORED TO DEMONSTRATE ALL THOSE ABOUT WHICH THERE COULD BE ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT
311-124404-0017 THAT EVEN IF GOD HAD CREATED MORE WORLDS THERE COULD HAVE BEEN NONE IN WHICH THESE LAWS WERE NOT OBSERVED THEREAFTER I SHOWED HOW THE GREATEST PART OF THE MATTER OF THIS CHAOS MUST IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE LAWS DISPOSE AND ARRANGE ITSELF IN SUCH A WAY
311-124404-0018 AS TO PRESENT THE APPEARANCE OF HEAVENS HOW IN THE MEANTIME SOME OF ITS PARTS MUST COMPOSE AN EARTH AND SOME PLANETS AND COMETS AND OTHERS A SUN AND FIXED STARS AND MAKING A DIGRESSION AT THIS STAGE ON THE SUBJECT OF LIGHT
311-124404-0019 I EXPOUNDED AT CONSIDERABLE LENGTH WHAT THE NATURE OF THAT LIGHT MUST BE
311-124404-0020 AND HOW THENCE IN AN INSTANT OF TIME IT TRAVERSES THE IMMENSE SPACES OF THE HEAVENS AND HOW FROM THE PLANETS AND COMETS IT IS REFLECTED TOWARDS THE EARTH TO THIS I LIKEWISE ADDED MUCH RESPECTING THE SUBSTANCE THE SITUATION THE MOTIONS
311-124404-0021 AND ALL THE DIFFERENT QUALITIES OF THESE HEAVENS AND STARS SO THAT I THOUGHT I HAD SAID ENOUGH RESPECTING THEM TO SHOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING OBSERVABLE IN THE HEAVENS OR STARS OF OUR SYSTEM THAT MUST NOT OR AT LEAST MAY NOT APPEAR PRECISELY ALIKE IN THOSE OF THE SYSTEM WHICH I DESCRIBED
311-124404-0022 I CAME NEXT TO SPEAK OF THE EARTH IN PARTICULAR AND TO SHOW HOW EVEN THOUGH I HAD EXPRESSLY SUPPOSED THAT GOD HAD GIVEN NO WEIGHT TO THE MATTER OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED THIS SHOULD NOT PREVENT ALL ITS PARTS FROM TENDING EXACTLY
311-124404-0023 TO THAT OBSERVED IN OUR SEAS AS ALSO A CERTAIN CURRENT BOTH OF WATER AND AIR FROM EAST TO WEST SUCH AS IS LIKEWISE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE TROPICS HOW THE MOUNTAINS SEAS FOUNTAINS AND RIVERS MIGHT NATURALLY BE FORMED IN IT
311-124404-0024 AND THE METALS PRODUCED IN THE MINES AND THE PLANTS GROW IN THE FIELDS AND IN GENERAL HOW ALL THE BODIES WHICH ARE COMMONLY DENOMINATED MIXED OR COMPOSITE MIGHT BE GENERATED AND AMONG OTHER THINGS IN THE DISCOVERIES ALLUDED TO
311-124404-0025 I KNEW NOTHING EXCEPT FIRE WHICH PRODUCES LIGHT I SPARED NO PAINS TO SET FORTH ALL THAT PERTAINS TO ITS NATURE THE MANNER OF ITS PRODUCTION AND SUPPORT AND TO EXPLAIN HOW HEAT IS SOMETIMES FOUND WITHOUT LIGHT AND LIGHT WITHOUT HEAT
311-124404-0026 TO SHOW HOW IT CAN INDUCE VARIOUS COLORS UPON DIFFERENT BODIES AND OTHER DIVERSE QUALITIES HOW IT REDUCES SOME TO A LIQUID STATE AND HARDENS OTHERS HOW IT CAN CONSUME ALMOST ALL BODIES OR CONVERT THEM INTO ASHES AND SMOKE
311-124404-0027 AND FINALLY HOW FROM THESE ASHES
311-124404-0028 FOR AS THIS TRANSMUTATION OF ASHES INTO GLASS APPEARED TO ME AS WONDERFUL AS ANY OTHER IN NATURE I TOOK A SPECIAL PLEASURE IN DESCRIBING IT I WAS NOT HOWEVER DISPOSED FROM THESE CIRCUMSTANCES
311-124404-0029 TO CONCLUDE THAT THIS WORLD HAD BEEN CREATED IN THE MANNER I DESCRIBED
311-124404-0030 BUT THIS IS CERTAIN AND AN OPINION COMMONLY RECEIVED AMONG THEOLOGIANS THAT THE ACTION BY WHICH HE NOW SUSTAINS IT IS THE SAME WITH THAT BY WHICH HE ORIGINALLY CREATED IT
311-124404-0031 SO THAT EVEN ALTHOUGH HE HAD FROM THE BEGINNING GIVEN IT NO OTHER FORM THAN THAT OF CHAOS PROVIDED ONLY HE HAD ESTABLISHED CERTAIN LAWS OF NATURE AND HAD LENT IT HIS CONCURRENCE TO ENABLE IT TO ACT AS IT IS WONT TO DO
311-124404-0032 IT MAY BE BELIEVED WITHOUT DISCREDIT TO THE MIRACLE OF CREATION THAT IN THIS WAY ALONE THINGS PURELY MATERIAL MIGHT IN COURSE OF TIME
311-124404-0033 FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF INANIMATE BODIES AND PLANTS I PASSED TO ANIMALS AND PARTICULARLY TO MAN
311-124404-0034 BUT SINCE I HAD NOT AS YET SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE TO ENABLE ME TO TREAT OF THESE IN THE SAME MANNER AS OF THE REST THAT IS TO SAY BY DEDUCING EFFECTS FROM THEIR CAUSES AND BY SHOWING
311-124404-0035 NATURE MUST PRODUCE THEM I REMAINED SATISFIED WITH THE SUPPOSITION THAT GOD FORMED THE BODY OF MAN WHOLLY LIKE TO ONE OF OURS AS WELL IN THE EXTERNAL SHAPE OF THE MEMBERS AS IN THE INTERNAL CONFORMATION OF THE ORGANS
311-124404-0036 OF THE SAME MATTER WITH THAT I HAD DESCRIBED AND AT FIRST PLACED IN IT NO RATIONAL SOUL NOR ANY OTHER PRINCIPLE IN ROOM OF THE VEGETATIVE OR SENSITIVE SOUL BEYOND KINDLING IN THE HEART ONE OF THOSE FIRES WITHOUT LIGHT
311-124404-0037 AND WHICH I THOUGHT WAS NOT DIFFERENT FROM THE HEAT IN HAY THAT HAS BEEN HEAPED TOGETHER BEFORE IT IS DRY OR THAT WHICH CAUSES FERMENTATION IN NEW WINES BEFORE THEY ARE RUN CLEAR OF THE FRUIT FOR WHEN I EXAMINED THE KIND OF FUNCTIONS WHICH MIGHT
311-124404-0038 AS CONSEQUENCES OF THIS SUPPOSITION EXIST IN THIS BODY I FOUND PRECISELY ALL THOSE WHICH MAY EXIST IN US INDEPENDENTLY
311-124404-0039 CONSISTS IN THINKING FUNCTIONS IN WHICH THE ANIMALS VOID OF REASON MAY BE SAID WHOLLY TO RESEMBLE US BUT AMONG WHICH I COULD NOT DISCOVER ANY OF THOSE THAT AS DEPENDENT ON THOUGHT ALONE BELONG TO US AS MEN
311-124404-0040 WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND I DID AFTERWARDS DISCOVER THESE AS SOON AS I SUPPOSED GOD TO HAVE CREATED A RATIONAL SOUL AND TO HAVE ANNEXED IT TO THIS BODY IN A PARTICULAR MANNER WHICH I DESCRIBED
311-124404-0041 WILL AFFORD THE MEANS OF READILY DETERMINING WHAT SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF ALL THE REST
311-124404-0042 TO TAKE THE TROUBLE OF GETTING DISSECTED IN THEIR PRESENCE THE HEART OF SOME LARGE ANIMAL POSSESSED OF LUNGS
311-124404-0043 AND TO HAVE SHOWN TO THEM ITS TWO VENTRICLES OR CAVITIES IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT IN THE RIGHT SIDE WITH WHICH CORRESPOND TWO VERY AMPLE TUBES VIZ THE HOLLOW VEIN VENA CAVA
311-124404-0044 WHICH IS THE PRINCIPAL RECEPTACLE OF THE BLOOD AND THE TRUNK OF THE TREE AS IT WERE OF WHICH ALL THE OTHER VEINS IN THE BODY ARE BRANCHES AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN VENA ARTERIOSA INAPPROPRIATELY SO DENOMINATED
311-124404-0045 PRESENTLY DISPERSE THEMSELVES ALL OVER THE LUNGS IN THE SECOND PLACE THE CAVITY IN THE LEFT SIDE
311-124404-0046 TWO CANALS IN SIZE EQUAL TO OR LARGER THAN THE PRECEDING VIZ THE VENOUS ARTERY ARTERIA VENOSA LIKEWISE INAPPROPRIATELY THUS DESIGNATED BECAUSE IT IS SIMPLY A VEIN WHICH COMES FROM THE LUNGS
311-124404-0047 WHERE IT IS DIVIDED INTO MANY BRANCHES INTERLACED WITH THOSE OF THE ARTERIAL VEIN AND THOSE OF THE TUBE CALLED THE WINDPIPE THROUGH WHICH THE AIR WE BREATHE ENTERS AND THE GREAT ARTERY WHICH ISSUING FROM THE HEART SENDS ITS BRANCHES ALL OVER THE BODY
311-124404-0048 I SHOULD WISH ALSO THAT SUCH PERSONS WERE CAREFULLY SHOWN THE ELEVEN PELLICLES WHICH LIKE SO MANY SMALL VALVES OPEN AND SHUT THE FOUR ORIFICES THAT ARE IN THESE TWO CAVITIES VIZ
311-124404-0049 THREE AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE HOLLOW VEINS WHERE THEY ARE DISPOSED IN SUCH A MANNER AS BY NO MEANS TO PREVENT THE BLOOD WHICH IT CONTAINS FROM FLOWING INTO THE RIGHT VENTRICLE OF THE HEART AND YET EXACTLY TO PREVENT ITS FLOWING OUT THREE AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE ARTERIAL VEIN
311-124404-0050 WHICH ARRANGED IN A MANNER EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF THE FORMER READILY PERMIT THE BLOOD CONTAINED IN THIS CAVITY TO PASS INTO THE LUNGS BUT HINDER THAT CONTAINED IN THE LUNGS FROM RETURNING TO THIS CAVITY AND IN LIKE MANNER
311-124404-0051 TWO OTHERS AT THE MOUTH OF THE VENOUS ARTERY WHICH ALLOW THE BLOOD FROM THE LUNGS TO FLOW INTO THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART BUT PRECLUDE ITS RETURN AND THREE AT THE MOUTH OF THE GREAT ARTERY WHICH SUFFER THE BLOOD TO FLOW FROM THE HEART
311-124404-0052 BUT PREVENT ITS REFLUX NOR DO WE NEED TO SEEK ANY OTHER REASON FOR THE NUMBER OF THESE PELLICLES BEYOND THIS THAT THE ORIFICE OF THE VENOUS ARTERY BEING OF AN OVAL SHAPE FROM THE NATURE OF ITS SITUATION CAN BE ADEQUATELY CLOSED WITH TWO
311-124404-0053 WHEREAS THE OTHERS BEING ROUND ARE MORE CONVENIENTLY CLOSED WITH THREE BESIDES I WISH SUCH PERSONS TO OBSERVE THAT THE GRAND ARTERY AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN ARE OF MUCH HARDER AND FIRMER TEXTURE
311-124404-0054 AND THERE FORM AS IT WERE TWO POUCHES DENOMINATED THE AURICLES OF THE HEART WHICH ARE COMPOSED OF A SUBSTANCE SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE HEART ITSELF AND THAT THERE IS ALWAYS MORE WARMTH IN THE HEART THAN IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE BODY
311-124404-0055 AND FINALLY THAT THIS HEAT IS CAPABLE OF CAUSING ANY DROP OF BLOOD THAT PASSES INTO THE CAVITIES RAPIDLY TO EXPAND AND DILATE JUST AS ALL LIQUORS DO WHEN ALLOWED TO FALL DROP BY DROP INTO A HIGHLY HEATED VESSEL
311-124404-0056 FOR AFTER THESE THINGS IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR ME TO SAY ANYTHING MORE WITH A VIEW TO EXPLAIN THE MOTION OF THE HEART EXCEPT THAT WHEN ITS CAVITIES ARE NOT FULL OF BLOOD
311-124404-0057 INTO THESE THE BLOOD OF NECESSITY FLOWS FROM THE HOLLOW VEIN INTO THE RIGHT AND FROM THE VENOUS ARTERY INTO THE LEFT BECAUSE THESE TWO VESSELS ARE ALWAYS FULL OF BLOOD AND THEIR ORIFICES WHICH ARE TURNED TOWARDS THE HEART CANNOT THEN BE CLOSED
311-124404-0058 BECAUSE THE ORIFICES THROUGH WHICH THEY PASS ARE WIDE
311-124404-0059 ARE IMMEDIATELY RAREFIED AND DILATED BY THE HEAT THEY MEET WITH IN THIS WAY THEY CAUSE THE WHOLE HEART TO EXPAND AND AT THE SAME TIME PRESS HOME AND SHUT THE FIVE SMALL VALVES THAT ARE AT THE ENTRANCES
311-124404-0060 OF THE TWO VESSELS FROM WHICH THEY FLOW AND THUS PREVENT ANY MORE BLOOD FROM COMING DOWN INTO THE HEART AND BECOMING MORE AND MORE RAREFIED THEY PUSH OPEN THE SIX SMALL VALVES THAT ARE IN THE ORIFICES OF THE OTHER TWO VESSELS THROUGH WHICH THEY PASS OUT
311-124404-0061 CAUSING IN THIS WAY ALL THE BRANCHES OF THE ARTERIAL VEIN AND OF THE GRAND ARTERY TO EXPAND ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE HEART WHICH IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER BEGINS TO CONTRACT AS DO ALSO THE ARTERIES
311-124404-0062 AND THE SIX SMALL VALVES CLOSE AND THE FIVE OF THE HOLLOW
311-124404-0063 VENOUS ARTERY OPEN ANEW AND ALLOW A PASSAGE
311-124404-0064 WHICH CAUSE THE HEART AND THE ARTERIES AGAIN TO EXPAND AS BEFORE AND BECAUSE THE BLOOD WHICH THUS ENTERS INTO THE HEART PASSES
311-124404-0065 IT THENCE HAPPENS THAT THEIR MOTION IS THE CONTRARY OF THAT OF THE HEART AND THAT WHEN IT EXPANDS THEY CONTRACT BUT LEST THOSE WHO ARE IGNORANT OF THE FORCE OF MATHEMATICAL DEMONSTRATIONS AND WHO ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO DISTINGUISH
311-124404-0066 TRUE REASONS FROM MERE VERISIMILITUDES SHOULD VENTURE WITHOUT EXAMINATION TO DENY WHAT HAS BEEN SAID I WISH IT TO BE CONSIDERED THAT THE MOTION WHICH I HAVE NOW EXPLAINED FOLLOWS AS NECESSARILY
311-124404-0067 FROM THE VERY ARRANGEMENT OF THE PARTS WHICH MAY BE OBSERVED IN THE HEART BY THE EYE ALONE AND FROM THE HEAT WHICH MAY BE FELT WITH THE FINGERS AND FROM THE NATURE OF THE BLOOD AS LEARNED FROM EXPERIENCE AS DOES THE MOTION OF A CLOCK FROM THE POWER
311-124404-0068 THE SITUATION AND SHAPE OF ITS COUNTERWEIGHTS AND WHEELS BUT IF IT BE ASKED HOW IT HAPPENS THAT THE BLOOD IN THE VEINS FLOWING IN THIS WAY CONTINUALLY INTO THE HEART IS NOT EXHAUSTED
311-124404-0069 AND OF HAVING BEEN THE FIRST TO TEACH THAT THERE ARE MANY SMALL PASSAGES AT THE EXTREMITIES OF THE ARTERIES THROUGH WHICH THE BLOOD RECEIVED BY THEM FROM THE HEART PASSES INTO THE SMALL BRANCHES OF THE VEINS
311-124404-0070 SO THAT ITS COURSE AMOUNTS PRECISELY TO A PERPETUAL CIRCULATION OF THIS WE HAVE ABUNDANT PROOF IN THE ORDINARY EXPERIENCE OF SURGEONS WHO BY BINDING THE ARM WITH A TIE OF MODERATE STRAITNESS ABOVE THE PART WHERE THEY OPEN THE VEIN
311-124404-0071 CAUSE THE BLOOD TO FLOW MORE COPIOUSLY THAN IT WOULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT ANY LIGATURE WHEREAS QUITE THE CONTRARY WOULD HAPPEN WERE THEY TO BIND IT BELOW THAT IS BETWEEN THE HAND AND THE OPENING OR WERE TO MAKE THE LIGATURE ABOVE
311-124404-0072 THE OPENING VERY TIGHT FOR IT IS MANIFEST THAT THE TIE MODERATELY STRAIGHTENED WHILE ADEQUATE TO HINDER THE BLOOD ALREADY IN THE ARM FROM RETURNING TOWARDS THE HEART BY THE VEINS CANNOT ON THAT ACCOUNT PREVENT NEW BLOOD
311-124404-0073 FROM COMING FORWARD THROUGH THE ARTERIES BECAUSE THESE ARE SITUATED BELOW THE VEINS AND THEIR COVERINGS FROM THEIR GREATER CONSISTENCY ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO COMPRESS AND ALSO THAT THE BLOOD WHICH COMES FROM THE HEART TENDS TO PASS THROUGH THEM
311-124404-0074 TO THE HAND WITH GREATER FORCE THAN IT DOES TO RETURN FROM THE HAND TO THE HEART THROUGH THE VEINS AND SINCE THE LATTER CURRENT ESCAPES FROM THE ARM BY THE OPENING MADE IN ONE OF THE VEINS THERE MUST OF NECESSITY
311-124404-0075 WHICH IS IN THE BODY MAY FLOW OUT OF IT IN A VERY SHORT TIME THROUGH A SINGLE ARTERY THAT HAS BEEN CUT
311-124404-0076 SO AS TO PREVENT THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE BLOOD FLOWING OUT OF IT COULD COME FROM ANY OTHER QUARTER THAN THE HEART BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH EVINCE THAT WHAT I HAVE ALLEGED
311-124404-0077 IS THE TRUE CAUSE OF THE MOTION OF THE BLOOD THUS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE DIFFERENCE THAT IS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE BLOOD WHICH FLOWS FROM THE VEINS AND THAT FROM THE ARTERIES CAN ONLY ARISE FROM THIS
311-124404-0078 AND MORE VIVID AND WARMER IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEAVING THE HEART IN OTHER WORDS WHEN IN THE ARTERIES THAN IT WAS A SHORT TIME BEFORE PASSING INTO EITHER IN OTHER WORDS WHEN IT WAS IN THE VEINS
311-124404-0079 AND IF ATTENTION BE GIVEN IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THIS DIFFERENCE IS VERY MARKED ONLY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE HEART
311-124404-0080 IN PARTS MORE REMOTE FROM IT IN THE NEXT PLACE
311-124404-0081 SUFFICIENTLY SHOWS THAT THE BLOOD IS IMPELLED AGAINST THEM WITH MORE FORCE THAN AGAINST THE VEINS AND WHY SHOULD THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART
311-124404-0082 AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN WERE IT NOT THAT THE BLOOD OF THE VENOUS ARTERY HAVING ONLY BEEN IN THE LUNGS AFTER IT HAS PASSED THROUGH THE HEART IS THINNER AND RAREFIES MORE READILY AND IN A HIGHER DEGREE
311-124404-0083 WHENCE IT HAPPENS THAT IF THE BLOOD BE WITHDRAWN FROM ANY PART THE HEAT IS LIKEWISE WITHDRAWN BY THE SAME MEANS AND ALTHOUGH THE HEART WERE AS HOT AS GLOWING IRON IT WOULD NOT BE CAPABLE OF WARMING THE FEET AND HANDS
311-124404-0084 AND THAT IN CHILDREN WHO CANNOT USE THEM WHILE IN THE WOMB
311-124404-0085 WHEN IT IS CONSIDERED THAT IT IS DISTILLED BY PASSING AND REPASSING THROUGH THE HEART PERHAPS MORE THAN ONE OR TWO HUNDRED TIMES IN A DAY
311-124404-0086 AND THE PRODUCTION OF THE DIFFERENT HUMORS OF THE BODY BEYOND SAYING THAT THE FORCE WITH WHICH THE BLOOD IN BEING RAREFIED PASSES FROM THE HEART TOWARDS THE EXTREMITIES OF THE ARTERIES CAUSES CERTAIN OF ITS PARTS TO REMAIN IN THE MEMBERS AT WHICH THEY ARRIVE
311-124404-0087 AND THERE OCCUPY THE PLACE OF SOME OTHERS EXPELLED BY THEM AND THAT ACCORDING TO THE SITUATION SHAPE OR SMALLNESS OF THE PORES WITH WHICH THEY MEET SOME RATHER THAN OTHERS FLOW INTO CERTAIN PARTS
311-124404-0088 WHICH BY BEING VARIOUSLY PERFORATED SERVE TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF GRAIN AND IN THE LAST PLACE WHAT ABOVE ALL IS HERE WORTHY OF OBSERVATION
311-124404-0089 IS THE GENERATION OF THE ANIMAL SPIRITS WHICH ARE LIKE A VERY SUBTLE WIND OR RATHER A VERY PURE AND VIVID FLAME WHICH
311-124404-0090 ASCENDING IN GREAT ABUNDANCE FROM THE HEART TO THE BRAIN THENCE PENETRATES THROUGH THE NERVES INTO THE MUSCLES AND GIVES MOTION TO ALL THE MEMBERS SO THAT TO ACCOUNT FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE BLOOD WHICH AS MOST AGITATED AND PENETRATING
311-124404-0091 PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE BRAIN IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO SUPPOSE ANY OTHER CAUSE THAN SIMPLY THAT THE ARTERIES WHICH CARRY THEM THITHER PROCEED FROM THE HEART
311-124404-0092 IN THE MOST DIRECT LINES AND THAT ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF MECHANICS WHICH ARE THE SAME WITH THOSE OF NATURE WHEN MANY OBJECTS TEND AT ONCE TO THE SAME POINT
311-124404-0093 WHICH FLOW FORTH FROM THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART AND TEND TOWARDS THE BRAIN THE WEAKER AND LESS AGITATED PARTS MUST NECESSARILY BE DRIVEN ASIDE FROM THAT POINT BY THE STRONGER WHICH ALONE IN THIS WAY REACH IT
311-124404-0094 I HAD EXPOUNDED ALL THESE MATTERS WITH SUFFICIENT MINUTENESS IN THE TREATISE WHICH I FORMERLY THOUGHT OF PUBLISHING AND AFTER THESE I HAD SHOWN WHAT MUST BE THE FABRIC OF THE NERVES AND MUSCLES OF THE HUMAN BODY
311-124404-0095 TO GIVE THE ANIMAL SPIRITS CONTAINED IN IT THE POWER TO MOVE THE MEMBERS AS WHEN WE SEE HEADS SHORTLY AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN STRUCK OFF STILL MOVE AND BITE THE EARTH ALTHOUGH NO LONGER ANIMATED WHAT CHANGES MUST TAKE PLACE IN THE BRAIN TO PRODUCE
311-124404-0096 WAKING SLEEP AND DREAMS HOW LIGHT SOUNDS ODORS TASTES HEAT AND ALL THE OTHER QUALITIES OF EXTERNAL OBJECTS IMPRESS IT WITH DIFFERENT IDEAS BY MEANS OF THE SENSES HOW HUNGER
311-124404-0097 THIRST AND THE OTHER INTERNAL AFFECTIONS CAN LIKEWISE IMPRESS UPON IT DIVERS IDEAS WHAT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE COMMON SENSE SENSUS COMMUNIS IN WHICH THESE IDEAS ARE RECEIVED BY THE MEMORY WHICH RETAINS THEM
311-124404-0098 BY THE FANTASY WHICH CAN CHANGE THEM IN VARIOUS WAYS AND OUT OF THEM COMPOSE NEW IDEAS AND WHICH BY THE SAME MEANS DISTRIBUTING THE ANIMAL SPIRITS THROUGH THE MUSCLES CAN CAUSE THE MEMBERS OF SUCH A BODY TO MOVE IN AS MANY DIFFERENT WAYS
311-124404-0099 TO THOSE WHO ARE ACQUAINTED WITH THE VARIETY OF MOVEMENTS PERFORMED BY THE DIFFERENT AUTOMATA OR MOVING MACHINES FABRICATED BY HUMAN INDUSTRY AND THAT WITH HELP OF BUT FEW PIECES COMPARED WITH THE GREAT MULTITUDE OF BONES
311-124404-0100 MUSCLES NERVES ARTERIES VEINS AND OTHER PARTS THAT ARE FOUND IN THE BODY OF EACH ANIMAL SUCH PERSONS WILL LOOK UPON THIS BODY AS A MACHINE MADE BY THE HANDS OF GOD WHICH IS INCOMPARABLY BETTER ARRANGED
311-124404-0101 AND ADEQUATE TO MOVEMENTS MORE ADMIRABLE THAN IS ANY MACHINE OF HUMAN INVENTION AND HERE I SPECIALLY STAYED TO SHOW THAT WERE THERE SUCH MACHINES EXACTLY RESEMBLING ORGANS AND OUTWARD FORM AN APE OR ANY OTHER IRRATIONAL ANIMAL
311-124404-0102 WE COULD HAVE NO MEANS OF KNOWING THAT THEY WERE IN ANY RESPECT OF A DIFFERENT NATURE FROM THESE ANIMALS BUT IF THERE WERE MACHINES BEARING THE IMAGE OF OUR BODIES AND CAPABLE OF IMITATING OUR ACTIONS AS FAR AS IT IS MORALLY POSSIBLE
311-124404-0103 OUR THOUGHTS TO OTHERS FOR WE MAY EASILY CONCEIVE A MACHINE TO BE SO CONSTRUCTED THAT IT EMITS VOCABLES AND EVEN THAT IT EMITS SOME CORRESPONDENT TO THE ACTION UPON IT OF EXTERNAL OBJECTS WHICH CAUSE A CHANGE IN ITS ORGANS
311-124404-0104 FOR EXAMPLE IF TOUCHED IN A PARTICULAR PLACE IT MAY DEMAND WHAT WE WISH TO SAY TO IT IF IN ANOTHER IT MAY CRY OUT THAT IT IS HURT AND SUCH LIKE
311-124404-0105 APPOSITELY TO REPLY TO WHAT IS SAID IN ITS PRESENCE AS MEN OF THE LOWEST GRADE OF INTELLECT CAN DO THE SECOND TEST IS THAT ALTHOUGH SUCH MACHINES MIGHT EXECUTE MANY THINGS WITH EQUAL OR PERHAPS GREATER PERFECTION THAN ANY OF US
311-124404-0106 THESE ORGANS ON THE CONTRARY NEED A PARTICULAR ARRANGEMENT FOR EACH PARTICULAR ACTION WHENCE IT MUST BE MORALLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT THERE SHOULD EXIST IN ANY MACHINE A DIVERSITY OF ORGANS SUFFICIENT
311-124404-0107 THAT THERE ARE NO MEN SO DULL AND STUPID NOT EVEN IDIOTS AS TO BE INCAPABLE OF JOINING TOGETHER DIFFERENT WORDS AND THEREBY CONSTRUCTING A DECLARATION BY WHICH TO MAKE THEIR THOUGHTS UNDERSTOOD
311-124404-0108 DESTITUTE OF THE ORGANS WHICH OTHERS USE IN SPEAKING ARE IN THE HABIT OF SPONTANEOUSLY INVENTING CERTAIN SIGNS BY WHICH THEY DISCOVER THEIR THOUGHTS TO THOSE WHO BEING USUALLY IN THEIR COMPANY HAVE LEISURE TO LEARN THEIR LANGUAGE
311-124404-0109 AND THIS PROVES NOT ONLY THAT THE BRUTES HAVE LESS REASON THAN MAN BUT THAT THEY HAVE NONE AT ALL FOR WE SEE THAT VERY LITTLE IS REQUIRED TO ENABLE A PERSON TO SPEAK
311-124404-0110 AND SINCE A CERTAIN INEQUALITY OF CAPACITY IS OBSERVABLE AMONG ANIMALS OF THE SAME SPECIES AS WELL AS AMONG MEN AND SINCE SOME ARE MORE CAPABLE OF BEING INSTRUCTED THAN OTHERS IT IS INCREDIBLE THAT THE MOST PERFECT APE OR PARROT OF ITS SPECIES
311-124404-0111 SHOULD NOT IN THIS BE EQUAL TO THE MOST STUPID INFANT OF ITS KIND OR AT LEAST TO ONE THAT WAS CRACK BRAINED UNLESS THE SOUL OF BRUTES
311-124404-0112 AND WE OUGHT NOT TO CONFOUND SPEECH WITH THE NATURAL MOVEMENTS WHICH INDICATE THE PASSIONS AND CAN BE IMITATED BY MACHINES AS WELL AS MANIFESTED BY ANIMALS NOR MUST IT BE THOUGHT WITH CERTAIN OF THE ANCIENTS THAT THE BRUTES SPEAK ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR LANGUAGE
311-124404-0113 SINCE THEY ARE ENDOWED WITH MANY ORGANS ANALOGOUS TO OURS THEY COULD AS EASILY COMMUNICATE THEIR THOUGHTS TO US AS TO THEIR FELLOWS
311-124404-0114 THAT THOUGH THERE ARE MANY ANIMALS WHICH MANIFEST MORE INDUSTRY THAN WE IN CERTAIN OF THEIR ACTIONS THE SAME ANIMALS ARE YET OBSERVED TO SHOW NONE AT ALL IN MANY OTHERS SO THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THEY DO BETTER
311-124404-0115 AND COULD SURPASS US IN ALL THINGS ON THE CONTRARY IT RATHER PROVES THAT THEY ARE DESTITUTE OF REASON AND THAT IT IS NATURE WHICH ACTS IN THEM ACCORDING TO THE DISPOSITION OF THEIR ORGANS THUS IT IS SEEN THAT A CLOCK COMPOSED ONLY OF WHEELS AND WEIGHTS
311-124404-0116 CAN NUMBER THE HOURS AND MEASURE TIME MORE EXACTLY THAN WE WITH ALL OUR SKIN I HAD AFTER THIS DESCRIBED THE REASONABLE SOUL AND SHOWN THAT IT COULD BY NO MEANS BE EDUCED FROM THE POWER OF MATTER
311-124404-0117 AS THE OTHER THINGS OF WHICH I HAD SPOKEN BUT THAT IT MUST BE EXPRESSLY CREATED AND THAT IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT THAT IT BE LODGED IN THE HUMAN BODY EXACTLY LIKE A PILOT IN A SHIP UNLESS PERHAPS TO MOVE ITS MEMBERS
311-124404-0118 BUT THAT IT IS NECESSARY FOR IT TO BE JOINED AND UNITED MORE CLOSELY TO THE BODY IN ORDER TO HAVE SENSATIONS AND APPETITES SIMILAR TO OURS AND THUS CONSTITUTE A REAL MAN
311-124404-0119 THERE IS NONE THAT IS MORE POWERFUL IN LEADING FEEBLE MINDS ASTRAY FROM THE STRAIGHT PATH OF VIRTUE
311-124404-0120 AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT AFTER THIS LIFE WE HAVE NOTHING TO HOPE FOR OR FEAR MORE THAN FLIES AND ANTS IN PLACE OF WHICH WHEN WE KNOW HOW FAR THEY DIFFER WE MUCH BETTER COMPREHEND THE REASONS WHICH ESTABLISH
311-124404-0121 BECAUSE NO OTHER CAUSES ARE OBSERVED CAPABLE OF DESTROYING IT
3112-9554-0000 HE DID NOT SPEAK ABOUT IT AT LENGTH BUT SAID THAT HE HAD WRITTEN ME A LETTER NOT TO BE OPENED UNTIL AFTER HIS DEATH CONTAINING INSTRUCTIONS FOR PUBLICATION THIS LETTER WAS DATED THIRTIETH APRIL
3112-9554-0001 EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX I WILL GIVE HERE AS MUCH OF IT AS CONCERNS THE PUBLIC I WISH YOU TO ACCEPT AS A GIFT FROM ME GIVEN YOU NOW THE ACCOMPANYING PAGES WHICH CONTAIN A MEMOIR OF MY LIFE
3112-9554-0002 MY INTENTION IS THAT THEY SHALL BE PUBLISHED AFTER MY DEATH AND BE EDITED BY YOU BUT I LEAVE IT ALTOGETHER TO YOUR DISCRETION WHETHER TO PUBLISH OR TO SUPPRESS THE WORK AND ALSO TO YOUR DISCRETION WHETHER ANY PART OR WHAT PART SHALL BE OMITTED
3112-9554-0003 BUT I WOULD NOT WISH THAT ANYTHING SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE MEMOIR IF YOU WISH TO SAY ANY WORD AS FROM YOURSELF LET IT BE DONE IN THE SHAPE OF A PREFACE OR INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER AT THE END THERE IS A POSTSCRIPT
3112-9554-0004 THE PUBLICATION IF MADE AT ALL SHOULD BE EFFECTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER MY DEATH MY FATHER DIED ON THE SIXTH OF DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO IT WILL BE SEEN THEREFORE
3112-9554-0005 THAT MY DUTY HAS BEEN MERELY TO PASS THE BOOK THROUGH THE PRESS CONFORMABLY TO THE ABOVE INSTRUCTIONS I HAVE PLACED HEADINGS TO THE RIGHT HAND PAGES THROUGHOUT THE BOOK AND I DO NOT CONCEIVE THAT I WAS PRECLUDED FROM SO DOING
3112-9554-0006 THAT HE HAD GIVEN UP HUNTING BUT HE STILL KEPT TWO HORSES FOR SUCH RIDING AS MAY BE HAD IN OR ABOUT THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF LONDON HE CONTINUED TO RIDE TO THE END OF HIS LIFE HE LIKED THE EXERCISE AND I THINK IT WOULD HAVE DISTRESSED HIM NOT TO HAVE HAD A HORSE IN HIS STABLE
3112-9554-0007 BUT HE NEVER SPOKE WILLINGLY ON HUNTING MATTERS HE HAD AT LAST RESOLVED TO GIVE UP HIS FAVOURITE AMUSEMENT AND THAT AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED THERE SHOULD BE AN END OF IT IN THE SPRING OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN HE WENT TO SOUTH AFRICA
3112-9554-0008 THE JOURNEY LASTED ALTOGETHER SIXTEEN DAYS AND DURING THAT TIME MISTER AND MISSUS BURNS WERE THE HOSPITABLE ENTERTAINERS WHEN MY FATHER RETURNED HE WROTE A SHORT ACCOUNT OF HOW THE MASTIFFS WENT TO ICELAND
3112-9554-0009 THE BOOK WAS PRINTED BUT WAS INTENDED ONLY FOR PRIVATE CIRCULATION EVERY DAY UNTIL HIS LAST ILLNESS MY FATHER CONTINUED HIS WORK HE WOULD NOT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN HAPPY
3112-9554-0010 HE DEMANDED FROM HIMSELF LESS THAN HE HAD DONE TEN YEARS PREVIOUSLY BUT HIS DAILY TASK WAS ALWAYS DONE I WILL MENTION NOW THE TITLES OF HIS BOOKS THAT WERE PUBLISHED AFTER THE LAST INCLUDED IN THE LIST WHICH HE HIMSELF HAS GIVEN AT THE END OF THE SECOND VOLUME
3112-9554-0011 AN EYE FOR AN EYE EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE COUSIN HENRY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE THACKERAY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE THE DUKE'S CHILDREN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY LIFE OF CICERO
3112-9554-0012 EIGHTEEN EIGHTY AYALA'S ANGEL EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE DOCTOR WORTLE'S SCHOOL EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE FRAU FROHMANN AND OTHER STORIES EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO
3112-9554-0013 AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH HE HAD WRITTEN FOUR FIFTHS OF AN IRISH STORY CALLED THE LANDLEAGUERS SHORTLY ABOUT TO BE PUBLISHED AND HE LEFT IN MANUSCRIPT A COMPLETED NOVEL CALLED AN OLD MAN'S LOVE
3112-9554-0014 WHICH WILL BE PUBLISHED BY MESSRS BLACKWOOD AND SONS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY MY FATHER LEFT LONDON AND WENT TO LIVE AT HARTING A VILLAGE IN SUSSEX BUT ON THE CONFINES OF HAMPSHIRE
3112-9554-0015 I THINK HE CHOSE THAT SPOT BECAUSE HE FOUND THERE A HOUSE THAT SUITED HIM AND BECAUSE OF THE PRETTINESS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HIS LAST LONG JOURNEY WAS A TRIP TO ITALY IN THE LATE WINTER AND SPRING OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE
3112-9554-0016 BUT HE WENT TO IRELAND TWICE IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO HE WENT THERE IN MAY OF THAT YEAR AND WAS THEN ABSENT NEARLY A MONTH THIS JOURNEY DID HIM MUCH GOOD FOR HE FOUND THAT THE SOFTER ATMOSPHERE RELIEVED HIS ASTHMA
3112-9554-0017 FROM WHICH HE HAD BEEN SUFFERING FOR NEARLY EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN AUGUST FOLLOWING HE MADE ANOTHER TRIP TO IRELAND BUT FROM THIS JOURNEY HE DERIVED LESS BENEFIT HE WAS MUCH INTERESTED IN AND WAS VERY MUCH DISTRESSED BY THE UNHAPPY CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY
3112-9554-0018 FEW MEN KNEW IRELAND BETTER THAN HE DID HE HAD LIVED THERE FOR SIXTEEN YEARS AND HIS POST OFFICE WORK HAD TAKEN HIM INTO EVERY PART OF THE ISLAND IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO HE BEGAN HIS LAST NOVEL
3112-9554-0019 THE LANDLEAGUERS WHICH AS STATED ABOVE WAS UNFINISHED WHEN HE DIED THIS BOOK WAS A CAUSE OF ANXIETY TO HIM HE COULD NOT RID HIS MIND OF THE FACT THAT HE HAD A STORY ALREADY IN THE COURSE OF PUBLICATION BUT WHICH HE HAD NOT YET COMPLETED
3112-9554-0020 IN NO OTHER CASE EXCEPT FRAMLEY PARSONAGE DID MY FATHER PUBLISH EVEN THE FIRST NUMBER OF ANY NOVEL BEFORE HE HAD FULLY COMPLETED THE WHOLE TALE
3112-9554-0021 HE WAS SEIZED WITH PARALYSIS ON THE RIGHT SIDE ACCOMPANIED BY LOSS OF SPEECH
3112-9554-0022 NEARLY FIVE WEEKS FROM THE NIGHT OF HIS ATTACK I HAVE BEEN LED TO SAY THESE FEW WORDS NOT AT ALL FROM A DESIRE TO SUPPLEMENT MY FATHER'S BIOGRAPHY OF HIMSELF BUT TO MENTION THE MAIN INCIDENTS IN HIS LIFE AFTER HE HAD FINISHED HIS OWN RECORD
3112-9554-0023 IN WHAT I HAVE HERE SAID I DO NOT THINK I HAVE EXCEEDED HIS INSTRUCTIONS
3112-9555-0000 CHAPTER ONE MY EDUCATION
3112-9555-0001 OF SO INSIGNIFICANT A PERSON AS MYSELF IT WILL NOT BE SO MUCH MY INTENTION TO SPEAK OF THE LITTLE DETAILS OF MY PRIVATE LIFE AS OF WHAT I AND PERHAPS OTHERS ROUND ME HAVE DONE IN LITERATURE
3112-9555-0002 OF MY FAILURES AND SUCCESSES SUCH AS THEY HAVE BEEN AND THEIR CAUSES AND OF THE OPENING WHICH A LITERARY CAREER OFFERS TO MEN AND WOMEN FOR THE EARNING OF THEIR BREAD
3112-9555-0003 AND YET THE GARRULITY OF OLD AGE AND THE APTITUDE OF A MAN'S MIND TO RECUR TO THE PASSAGES OF HIS OWN LIFE WILL I KNOW TEMPT ME TO SAY SOMETHING OF MYSELF
3112-9555-0004 NOR WITHOUT DOING SO SHOULD I KNOW HOW TO THROW MY MATTER INTO ANY RECOGNISED AND INTELLIGIBLE FORM THAT I OR ANY MAN SHOULD TELL EVERYTHING OF HIMSELF I HOLD TO BE IMPOSSIBLE
3112-9555-0005 I WILL SET DOWN NAUGHT IN MALICE NOR WILL I GIVE TO MYSELF OR OTHERS HONOUR WHICH I DO NOT BELIEVE TO HAVE BEEN FAIRLY WON MY BOYHOOD WAS I THINK AS UNHAPPY AS THAT OF A YOUNG GENTLEMAN COULD WELL BE
3112-9555-0006 MY MISFORTUNES ARISING FROM A MIXTURE OF POVERTY AND GENTLE STANDING ON THE PART OF MY FATHER
3112-9555-0007 I WAS BORN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN IN KEPPEL STREET RUSSELL SQUARE AND WHILE A BABY WAS CARRIED DOWN TO HARROW WHERE MY FATHER HAD BUILT A HOUSE ON A LARGE FARM
3112-9555-0008 AND PERHAPS THE DIRECTOR OF HER DESTINY AND OF OURS MY FATHER HAD BEEN A WYKAMIST AND A FELLOW OF NEW COLLEGE AND WINCHESTER WAS THE DESTINATION OF MY BROTHERS AND MYSELF
3112-9555-0009 AND SENT THREE OF US THERE ONE AFTER THE OTHER AT THE AGE OF SEVEN MY FATHER AT THIS TIME WAS A CHANCERY BARRISTER PRACTISING IN LONDON
3112-9555-0010 CHAMBERS WHICH ON ONE MELANCHOLY OCCASION DID BECOME ABSOLUTELY SUICIDAL
3112-9555-0011 IN HIS EARLY DAYS HE WAS A MAN OF SOME SMALL FORTUNE AND OF HIGHER HOPES THESE STOOD SO HIGH AT THE TIME OF MY BIRTH THAT HE WAS FELT TO BE ENTITLED TO A COUNTRY HOUSE AS WELL AS TO THAT IN KEPPEL STREET
3112-9555-0012 THIS PLACE HE CALLED JULIANS AND THE LAND RUNS UP TO THE FOOT OF THE HILL ON WHICH THE SCHOOL AND CHURCH STAND ON THE SIDE TOWARDS LONDON THINGS THERE WENT MUCH AGAINST HIM THE FARM WAS RUINOUS
3112-9555-0013 BUT AT ANY RATE AS OTHER DAY BOARDERS I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT THEY WERE WELL TREATED BUT I DOUBT WHETHER THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO THE IGNOMINY WHICH I ENDURED
3112-9555-0014 I WAS ONLY SEVEN AND I THINK THAT BOYS AT SEVEN ARE NOW SPARED AMONG THEIR MORE CONSIDERATE SENIORS I WAS NEVER SPARED AND WAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO RUN TO AND FRO BETWEEN OUR HOUSE AND THE SCHOOL
3112-9555-0015 WITHOUT A DAILY PURGATORY NO DOUBT MY APPEARANCE WAS AGAINST ME I REMEMBER WELL WHEN I WAS STILL THE JUNIOR BOY IN THE SCHOOL DOCTOR BUTLER THE HEAD MASTER STOPPING ME IN THE STREET AND ASKING ME
3112-9555-0016 PERHAPS HE DID NOT RECOGNISE ME BY MY FACE AT THIS TIME I WAS THREE YEARS AT HARROW AND AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER I WAS THE JUNIOR BOY IN THE SCHOOL WHEN I LEFT IT
3112-9555-0017 THEN I WAS SENT TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL AT SUNBURY KEPT BY ARTHUR DRURY THIS I THINK MUST HAVE BEEN DONE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ADVICE OF HENRY DRURY WHO WAS MY TUTOR AT HARROW SCHOOL AND MY FATHER'S FRIEND
3112-9555-0018 WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO VISIT THE PLAYGROUND TILL THE SERMON WAS FINISHED MINE WAS ONLY DONE A DAY OR TWO BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS MISSUS DRURY WHEN SHE SAW US SHOOK HER HEAD WITH PITYING HORROR
3112-9555-0019 THERE WERE EVER SO MANY OTHER PUNISHMENTS ACCUMULATED ON OUR HEADS IT BROKE MY HEART KNOWING MYSELF TO BE INNOCENT AND SUFFERING ALSO UNDER THE ALMOST EQUALLY PAINFUL FEELING THAT THE OTHER THREE NO DOUBT WICKED BOYS
3112-9555-0020 MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO BE THE LEADER OF WICKEDNESS ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE NEXT TERM HE WHISPERED TO ME HALF A WORD THAT PERHAPS HE HAD BEEN WRONG WITH ALL A STUPID BOY'S SLOWNESS I SAID NOTHING
3112-9555-0021 AND HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO CARRY REPARATION FURTHER ALL THAT WAS FIFTY YEARS AGO AND IT BURNS ME NOW AS THOUGH IT WERE YESTERDAY WHAT LILY LIVERED CURS THOSE BOYS MUST HAVE BEEN NOT TO HAVE TOLD THE TRUTH
3112-9555-0022 AT ANY RATE AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED I REMEMBER THEIR NAMES WELL AND ALMOST WISH TO WRITE THEM HERE WHEN I WAS TWELVE THERE CAME THE VACANCY AT WINCHESTER COLLEGE WHICH I WAS DESTINED TO FILL
3112-9555-0023 MY TWO ELDER BROTHERS HAD GONE THERE AND THE YOUNGER HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY BEING ALREADY SUPPOSED TO HAVE LOST HIS CHANCE OF NEW COLLEGE IT HAD BEEN ONE OF THE GREAT AMBITIONS OF MY FATHER'S LIFE THAT HIS THREE SONS WHO LIVED TO GO TO WINCHESTER
3112-9555-0024 SHOULD ALL BECOME FELLOWS OF NEW COLLEGE BUT THAT SUFFERING MAN WAS NEVER DESTINED TO HAVE AN AMBITION GRATIFIED WE ALL LOST THE PRIZE WHICH HE STRUGGLED WITH INFINITE LABOUR TO PUT WITHIN OUR REACH
3112-9555-0025 MY ELDEST BROTHER ALL BUT ACHIEVED IT AND AFTERWARDS WENT TO OXFORD TAKING THREE EXHIBITIONS FROM THE SCHOOL THOUGH HE LOST THE GREAT GLORY OF A WYKAMIST HE HAS SINCE MADE HIMSELF WELL KNOWN TO THE PUBLIC AS A WRITER
3112-9555-0026 IN CONNECTION WITH ALL ITALIAN SUBJECTS
3112-9555-0027 BUT MY OTHER BROTHER DIED EARLY WHILE I WAS AT WINCHESTER MY FATHER'S AFFAIRS WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE HE GAVE UP HIS PRACTICE AT THE BAR AND UNFORTUNATE THAT HE WAS TOOK ANOTHER FARM
3112-9555-0028 IT IS ODD THAT A MAN SHOULD CONCEIVE AND IN THIS CASE A HIGHLY EDUCATED AND A VERY CLEVER MAN THAT FARMING SHOULD BE A BUSINESS IN WHICH HE MIGHT MAKE MONEY WITHOUT ANY SPECIAL EDUCATION OR APPRENTICESHIP
3112-9555-0029 PERHAPS OF ALL TRADES IT IS THE ONE IN WHICH AN ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THINGS SHOULD BE DONE AND THE BEST MANNER OF DOING THEM IS MOST NECESSARY AND IT IS ONE ALSO FOR SUCCESS IN WHICH A SUFFICIENT CAPITAL IS INDISPENSABLE
3112-9555-0030 HE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE AND WHEN HE TOOK THIS SECOND FARM NO CAPITAL THIS WAS THE LAST STEP PREPARATORY TO HIS FINAL RUIN
3112-9555-0031 I HAVE NO CLEAR KNOWLEDGE OF HER OBJECT OR OF MY FATHER'S BUT I BELIEVE THAT HE HAD AN IDEA THAT MONEY MIGHT BE MADE BY SENDING GOODS LITTLE GOODS SUCH AS PIN CUSHIONS PEPPER BOXES AND POCKET KNIVES OUT TO THE STILL UNFURNISHED STATES
3112-9555-0032 I HAVE SEEN IT SINCE IN THE TOWN OF CINCINNATI A SORRY BUILDING BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS AN IMPOSING EDIFICE MY MOTHER WENT FIRST WITH MY SISTERS AND SECOND BROTHER
3112-9555-0033 THEN MY FATHER FOLLOWED THEM TAKING MY ELDER BROTHER BEFORE HE WENT TO OXFORD
3112-9555-0034 THERE HAVE BEEN HOT WORDS BETWEEN US FOR PERFECT FRIENDSHIP BEARS AND ALLOWS HOT WORDS FEW BROTHERS HAVE HAD MORE OF BROTHERHOOD BUT IN THOSE SCHOOL DAYS HE WAS OF ALL MY FOES THE WORST
3112-9555-0035 IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRACTICE OF THE COLLEGE WHICH SUBMITS OR DID THEN SUBMIT MUCH OF THE TUITION OF THE YOUNGER BOYS FROM THE ELDER HE WAS MY TUTOR AND IN HIS CAPACITY OF TEACHER AND RULER
3112-9555-0036 HE HAD STUDIED THE THEORIES OF DRACO
3112-9555-0037 HANG A LITTLE BOY FOR STEALING APPLES HE USED TO SAY AND OTHER LITTLE BOYS WILL NOT STEAL APPLES THE DOCTRINE WAS ALREADY EXPLODED ELSEWHERE BUT HE STUCK TO IT WITH CONSERVATIVE ENERGY THE RESULT WAS THAT AS
3112-9555-0038 A PART OF HIS DAILY EXERCISE HE THRASHED ME WITH A BIG STICK THAT SUCH THRASHINGS SHOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE AT A SCHOOL AS A CONTINUAL PART OF ONE'S DAILY LIFE
3112-9555-0039 SEEMS TO ME TO ARGUE A VERY ILL CONDITION OF SCHOOL DISCIPLINE AT THIS PERIOD I REMEMBER TO HAVE PASSED ONE SET OF HOLIDAYS THE MIDSUMMER HOLIDAYS IN MY FATHER'S CHAMBERS IN LINCOLN'S INN
3112-9555-0040 THERE WAS OFTEN A DIFFICULTY ABOUT THE HOLIDAYS AS TO WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH ME ON THIS OCCASION MY AMUSEMENT CONSISTED IN WANDERING ABOUT AMONG THOSE OLD DESERTED BUILDINGS AND IN READING SHAKESPEARE OUT OF A BI COLUMNED EDITION
3112-9555-0041 WHICH IS STILL AMONG MY BOOKS IT WAS NOT THAT I HAD CHOSEN SHAKESPEARE BUT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO READ AFTER A WHILE MY BROTHER LEFT WINCHESTER AND ACCOMPANIED MY FATHER TO AMERICA
3112-9555-0042 THEN ANOTHER AND A DIFFERENT HORROR FELL TO MY FATE MY COLLEGE BILLS HAD NOT BEEN PAID AND THE SCHOOL TRADESMEN WHO ADMINISTERED TO THE WANTS OF THE BOYS WERE TOLD NOT TO EXTEND THEIR CREDIT TO ME
3112-9555-0043 BOOTS WAISTCOATS AND POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS WHICH WITH SOME SLIGHT SUPERVEILLANCE WERE AT THE COMMAND OF OTHER SCHOLARS WERE CLOSED LUXURIES TO ME MY SCHOOLFELLOWS OF COURSE KNEW THAT IT WAS SO AND I BECAME A PARIAH
3112-9555-0044 IT IS THE NATURE OF BOYS TO BE CRUEL I HAVE SOMETIMES DOUBTED WHETHER AMONG EACH OTHER THEY DO USUALLY SUFFER MUCH ONE FROM THE OTHER'S CRUELTY BUT I SUFFERED HORRIBLY
3112-9555-0045 I COULD MAKE NO STAND AGAINST IT I HAD NO FRIEND TO WHOM I COULD POUR OUT MY SORROWS I WAS BIG AND AWKWARD AND UGLY AND I HAVE NO DOUBT SKULKED ABOUT IN A MOST UNATTRACTIVE MANNER
3112-9555-0046 OF COURSE I WAS ILL DRESSED AND DIRTY BUT AH HOW WELL I REMEMBER ALL THE AGONIES OF MY YOUNG HEART HOW I CONSIDERED WHETHER I SHOULD ALWAYS BE ALONE
3112-9555-0047 WHETHER I COULD NOT FIND MY WAY UP TO THE TOP OF THAT COLLEGE TOWER AND FROM THENCE PUT AN END TO EVERYTHING AND A WORSE THING CAME THAN THE STOPPAGE OF THE SUPPLIES FROM THE SHOPKEEPERS EVERY BOY HAD A SHILLING A WEEK POCKET MONEY WHICH WE CALLED BATTELS
3112-9555-0048 AND WHICH WAS ADVANCED TO US OUT OF THE POCKET OF THE SECOND MASTER ON ONE AWFUL DAY THE SECOND MASTER ANNOUNCED TO ME THAT MY BATTELS WOULD BE STOPPED HE TOLD ME THE REASON
3112-9555-0049 THE BATTELS FOR THE LAST HALF YEAR HAD NOT BEEN REPAID AND HE URGED HIS OWN UNWILLINGNESS TO ADVANCE THE MONEY THE LOSS OF A SHILLING A WEEK WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MUCH EVEN THOUGH POCKET MONEY FROM OTHER SOURCES NEVER REACHED ME
3112-9555-0050 AND NOW WHEN IT CAME TO THE TURN OF ANY SERVANT HE RECEIVED SIXTY NINE SHILLINGS INSTEAD OF SEVENTY AND THE CAUSE OF THE DEFALCATION WAS EXPLAINED TO HIM
3112-9555-0051 WHEN I HAD BEEN AT WINCHESTER SOMETHING OVER THREE YEARS MY FATHER RETURNED TO ENGLAND AND TOOK ME AWAY WHETHER THIS WAS DONE BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE OR BECAUSE MY CHANCE OF NEW COLLEGE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE PASSED AWAY
3112-9555-0052 MY FATHER AT THIS TIME HAVING LEFT MY MOTHER AND SISTERS WITH MY YOUNGER BROTHER IN AMERICA TOOK HIMSELF TO LIVE AT A WRETCHED TUMBLE DOWN FARMHOUSE ON THE SECOND FARM HE HAD HIRED AND I WAS TAKEN THERE WITH HIM IT WAS NEARLY THREE MILES FROM HARROW
3112-9555-0053 AT HARROW WEALD BUT IN THE PARISH AND FROM THIS HOUSE I WAS AGAIN SENT TO THAT SCHOOL AS A DAY BOARDER LET THOSE WHO KNOW WHAT IS THE USUAL APPEARANCE AND WHAT THE USUAL APPURTENANCES OF A BOY AT SUCH A SCHOOL
3112-9555-0054 FROM BARNS TO COWSHEDS AND FROM COWSHEDS TO DUNG HEAPS ONE COULD HARDLY TELL WHERE ONE BEGAN AND THE OTHER ENDED THERE WAS A PARLOUR IN WHICH MY FATHER LIVED SHUT UP AMONG BIG BOOKS
3112-9555-0055 BUT I PASSED MY MOST JOCUND HOURS IN THE KITCHEN MAKING INNOCENT LOVE TO THE BAILIFF'S DAUGHTER THE FARM KITCHEN MIGHT BE VERY WELL THROUGH THE EVENING WHEN THE HORRORS OF THE SCHOOL WERE OVER BUT IT ALL ADDED TO THE CRUELTY OF THE DAYS
3112-9555-0056 A SIZAR AT A CAMBRIDGE COLLEGE OR A BIBLE CLERK AT OXFORD HAS NOT PLEASANT DAYS OR USED NOT TO HAVE THEM HALF A CENTURY AGO BUT HIS POSITION WAS RECOGNISED AND THE MISERY WAS MEASURED
3112-9555-0057 THE INDIGNITIES I ENDURED ARE NOT TO BE DESCRIBED AS I LOOK BACK IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ALL HANDS WERE TURNED AGAINST ME THOSE OF MASTERS AS WELL AS BOYS I WAS ALLOWED TO JOIN IN NO PLAYS
3112-9555-0058 THE ONLY EXPENSE EXCEPT THAT OF BOOKS TO WHICH A HOUSE BOARDER WAS THEN SUBJECT WAS THE FEE TO A TUTOR AMOUNTING I THINK TO TEN GUINEAS MY TUTOR TOOK ME WITHOUT THE FEE
3112-9555-0059 BUT WHEN I HEARD HIM DECLARE THE FACT IN THE PUPIL ROOM BEFORE THE BOYS I HARDLY FELT GRATEFUL FOR THE CHARITY I WAS NEVER A COWARD AND CARED FOR A THRASHING AS LITTLE AS ANY BOY
3112-9555-0060 BUT ONE CANNOT MAKE A STAND AGAINST THE ACERBITIES OF THREE HUNDRED TYRANTS WITHOUT A MORAL COURAGE OF WHICH AT THAT TIME I POSSESSED NONE I KNOW THAT I SKULKED AND WAS ODIOUS TO THE EYES OF THOSE I ADMIRED AND ENVIED
3112-9555-0061 AT LAST I WAS DRIVEN TO REBELLION AND THERE CAME A GREAT FIGHT AT THE END OF WHICH MY OPPONENT HAD TO BE TAKEN HOME FOR A WHILE IF THESE WORDS BE EVER PRINTED
3112-9555-0062 I TRUST THAT SOME SCHOOLFELLOW OF THOSE DAYS MAY STILL BE LEFT ALIVE WHO WILL BE ABLE TO SAY THAT IN CLAIMING THIS SOLITARY GLORY OF MY SCHOOL DAYS I AM NOT MAKING A FALSE BOAST
3112-9555-0063 I WISH I COULD GIVE SOME ADEQUATE PICTURE OF THE GLOOM OF THAT FARMHOUSE MY ELDER BROTHER TOM AS I MUST CALL HIM IN MY NARRATIVE THOUGH THE WORLD I THINK KNOWS HIM BEST AS ADOLPHUS WAS AT OXFORD
3112-9555-0064 MY FATHER AND I LIVED TOGETHER HE HAVING NO MEANS OF LIVING EXCEPT WHAT CAME FROM THE FARM MY MEMORY TELLS ME THAT HE WAS ALWAYS IN DEBT TO HIS LANDLORD AND TO THE TRADESMEN HE EMPLOYED
3112-9555-0065 OF SELF INDULGENCE NO ONE COULD ACCUSE HIM OUR TABLE WAS POORER I THINK THAN THAT OF THE BAILIFF WHO STILL HUNG ON TO OUR SHATTERED FORTUNES THE FURNITURE WAS MEAN AND SCANTY
3112-9555-0066 INTO THE HAY FIELD ON HOLIDAYS I WAS OFTEN COMPELLED TO GO NOT I FEAR WITH MUCH PROFIT MY FATHER'S HEALTH WAS VERY BAD DURING THE LAST TEN YEARS OF HIS LIFE HE SPENT NEARLY THE HALF OF HIS TIME IN BED
3112-9555-0067 IT WAS HIS AMBITION TO DESCRIBE ALL ECCLESIASTICAL TERMS INCLUDING THE DENOMINATIONS OF EVERY FRATERNITY OF MONKS AND EVERY CONVENT OF NUNS WITH ALL THEIR ORDERS AND SUBDIVISIONS
3112-9555-0068 UNDER CRUSHING DISADVANTAGES WITH FEW OR NO BOOKS OF REFERENCE WITH IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO NO LIBRARY HE WORKED AT HIS MOST UNGRATEFUL TASK WITH UNFLAGGING INDUSTRY WHEN HE DIED
3112-9555-0069 THREE NUMBERS OUT OF EIGHT HAD BEEN PUBLISHED BY SUBSCRIPTION AND ARE NOW I FEAR UNKNOWN AND BURIED IN THE MIDST OF THAT HUGE PILE OF FUTILE LITERATURE THE BUILDING UP OF WHICH HAS BROKEN SO MANY HEARTS
3112-9555-0070 AND MY FATHER THOUGH HE WOULD TRY
3112-9555-0071 AND SAY MY EARLY RULES FROM THE LATIN GRAMMAR OR REPEAT THE GREEK ALPHABET AND WAS OBLIGED AT THESE EARLY LESSONS TO HOLD MY HEAD INCLINED TOWARDS HIM
3112-9555-0072 SO THAT IN THE EVENT OF GUILTY FAULT HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PULL MY HAIR WITHOUT STOPPING HIS RAZOR OR DROPPING HIS SHAVING BRUSH NO FATHER WAS EVER MORE ANXIOUS FOR THE EDUCATION OF HIS CHILDREN
3112-9555-0073 THOUGH I THINK NONE EVER KNEW LESS HOW TO GO ABOUT THE WORK OF AMUSEMENT AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER HE NEVER RECOGNISED THE NEED
3112-9555-0074 HE COULD NOT GIVE HIS TIME TO TEACH ME FOR EVERY HOUR THAT HE WAS NOT IN THE FIELDS WAS DEVOTED TO HIS MONKS AND NUNS BUT HE WOULD REQUIRE ME TO SIT AT A TABLE WITH LEXICON AND GRADUS BEFORE ME
3112-9555-0075 THOUGH I THINK I GRIEVED HIM MUCH BY MY IDLENESS BUT IN PASSION HE KNEW NOT WHAT HE DID AND HE HAS KNOCKED ME DOWN WITH THE GREAT FOLIO BIBLE WHICH HE ALWAYS USED
3112-9555-0076 IN THE OLD HOUSE WERE THE TWO FIRST VOLUMES OF COOPER'S NOVEL CALLED THE PRAIRIE A RELIC PROBABLY A DISHONEST RELIC OF SOME SUBSCRIPTION TO HOOKHAM'S LIBRARY OTHER BOOKS OF THE KIND THERE WAS NONE
3112-9555-0077 I WONDER HOW MANY DOZEN TIMES I READ THOSE TWO FIRST VOLUMES
3112-9555-0078 IT WAS THE HORROR OF THOSE DREADFUL WALKS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WHICH MADE MY LIFE SO BAD WHAT SO PLEASANT WHAT SO SWEET AS A WALK ALONG AN ENGLISH LANE WHEN THE AIR IS SWEET AND THE WEATHER FINE
3112-9555-0079 AND WHEN THERE IS A CHARM IN WALKING BUT HERE WERE THE SAME LANES FOUR TIMES A DAY IN WET AND DRY IN HEAT AND SUMMER WITH ALL THE ACCOMPANYING MUD AND DUST AND WITH DISORDERED CLOTHES
3112-9555-0080 BUT HIS SUCCESSOR LIVED TO BE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY I THINK IT WAS IN THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE THAT MY MOTHER WITH THE REST OF THE FAMILY RETURNED FROM AMERICA
3112-9555-0081 SHE LIVED AT FIRST AT THE FARMHOUSE BUT IT WAS ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME SHE CAME BACK WITH A BOOK WRITTEN ABOUT THE UNITED STATES AND THE IMMEDIATE PECUNIARY SUCCESS WHICH THAT WORK OBTAINED ENABLED HER TO TAKE US ALL BACK TO THE HOUSE AT HARROW
3112-9555-0082 NOT TO THE FIRST HOUSE WHICH WOULD STILL HAVE BEEN BEYOND HER MEANS BUT TO THAT WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN CALLED ORLEY FARM AND WHICH WAS AN EDEN AS COMPARED TO OUR ABODE AT HARROW WEALD
3112-9555-0083 HERE MY SCHOOLING WENT ON UNDER SOMEWHAT IMPROVED CIRCUMSTANCES THE THREE MILES BECAME HALF A MILE AND PROBABLY SOME SALUTARY CHANGES WERE MADE IN MY WARDROBE
3112-9555-0084 AND A GREAT ELEMENT OF HAPPINESS WAS ADDED TO US ALL IN THE AFFECTIONATE AND LIFE ENDURING FRIENDSHIP OF THE FAMILY OF OUR CLOSE NEIGHBOUR COLONEL GRANT BUT I WAS NEVER ABLE TO OVERCOME OR EVEN TO ATTEMPT TO OVERCOME THE ABSOLUTE ISOLATION OF MY SCHOOL POSITION
3112-9555-0085 I HAVE FELT THAT I HAD NO RIGHT TO TALK OF THINGS FROM MOST OF WHICH I WAS KEPT IN ESTRANGEMENT THROUGH ALL MY FATHER'S TROUBLES HE STILL DESIRED TO SEND ME EITHER TO OXFORD OR CAMBRIDGE
3112-9555-0086 AND VERY FORTUNATE IT WAS THAT I DID NOT SUCCEED FOR MY CAREER WITH SUCH ASSISTANCE ONLY AS A SCHOLARSHIP WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME WOULD HAVE ENDED IN DEBT AND IGNOMINY WHEN I LEFT HARROW I WAS ALL BUT NINETEEN
3112-9555-0087 AND I HAD AT FIRST GONE THERE AT SEVEN DURING THE WHOLE OF THOSE TWELVE YEARS NO ATTEMPT HAD BEEN MADE TO TEACH ME ANYTHING BUT LATIN AND GREEK AND VERY LITTLE ATTEMPT TO TEACH ME THOSE LANGUAGES
3112-9555-0088 AT THE SCHOOL AT SUNBURY THERE WAS CERTAINLY A WRITING MASTER AND A FRENCH MASTER THE LATTER WAS AN EXTRA AND I NEVER HAD EXTRAS
3112-9555-0089 I SUPPOSE I MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE WRITING MASTER'S CLASS BUT THOUGH I CAN CALL TO MIND THE MAN I CANNOT CALL TO MIND HIS FERULE IT WAS BY THEIR FERULES THAT I ALWAYS KNEW THEM AND THEY ME
3112-9555-0090 I FEEL CONVINCED IN MY MIND THAT I HAVE BEEN FLOGGED OFTENER THAN ANY HUMAN BEING ALIVE IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN FIVE SCOURGINGS IN ONE DAY AT WINCHESTER
3112-9555-0091 AND I HAVE OFTEN BOASTED THAT I OBTAINED THEM ALL LOOKING BACK OVER HALF A CENTURY
3112-9555-0092 I AM NOW A FAIR LATIN SCHOLAR THAT IS TO SAY I READ AND ENJOY THE LATIN CLASSICS AND COULD PROBABLY MAKE MYSELF UNDERSTOOD IN LATIN PROSE BUT THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH I HAVE I HAVE ACQUIRED SINCE I LEFT SCHOOL
3112-9555-0093 I BEAR IN MIND WELL WITH HOW PRODIGAL A HAND PRIZES USED TO BE SHOWERED ABOUT BUT I NEVER GOT A PRIZE FROM THE FIRST TO THE LAST THERE WAS NOTHING SATISFACTORY IN MY SCHOOL CAREER
3168-173564-0000 SONYA AND MADAME SCHOSS WHO HAD NOT YET UNDRESSED WENT OUT WITH HIM ONLY NATASHA AND THE COUNTESS REMAINED IN THE ROOM PETYA WAS NO LONGER WITH THE FAMILY

3168-173564-0003 THERE'S AN AWFUL GLOW NATASHA DO LOOK YOU CAN SEE IT FROM THE WINDOW SHE SAID TO HER COUSIN EVIDENTLY WISHING TO DISTRACT HER MIND BUT NATASHA LOOKED AT HER AS IF NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT WAS SAID TO HER
3168-173564-0004 AND AGAIN FIXED HER EYES ON THE CORNER OF THE STOVE SHE HAD BEEN IN THIS CONDITION OF STUPOR SINCE THE MORNING WHEN SONYA TO THE SURPRISE AND ANNOYANCE OF THE COUNTESS HAD FOR SOME UNACCOUNTABLE REASON
3168-173564-0005 FOUND IT NECESSARY TO TELL NATASHA OF PRINCE ANDREW'S WOUND AND OF HIS BEING WITH THEIR PARTY THE COUNTESS HAD SELDOM BEEN SO ANGRY WITH ANYONE AS SHE WAS WITH SONYA
3168-173564-0006 PAID UNCEASING ATTENTION TO HER COUSIN LOOK NATASHA HOW DREADFULLY IT IS BURNING SAID SHE WHAT'S BURNING ASKED NATASHA OH YES MOSCOW
3168-173564-0007 AND AS IF IN ORDER NOT TO OFFEND SONYA AND TO GET RID OF HER SHE TURNED HER FACE TO THE WINDOW LOOKED OUT IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SHE COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING AND AGAIN SETTLED DOWN IN HER FORMER ATTITUDE
3168-173564-0008 BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE IT YES REALLY I DID NATASHA REPLIED IN A VOICE THAT PLEADED TO BE LEFT IN PEACE

3168-173564-0013 EVIDENTLY DISBELIEVING WHAT THEY TOLD HER AND CONVINCED THAT SAY WHAT SHE MIGHT SHE WOULD STILL BE TOLD THE SAME ALL THE WAY SHE HAD SAT MOTIONLESS IN A CORNER OF THE COACH WITH WIDE OPEN EYES
3168-173564-0014 AND THE EXPRESSION IN THEM WHICH THE COUNTESS KNEW SO WELL AND FEARED SO MUCH AND NOW SHE SAT IN THE SAME WAY ON THE BENCH WHERE SHE HAD SEATED HERSELF ON ARRIVING SHE WAS PLANNING SOMETHING AND EITHER
3168-173564-0015 DECIDING OR HAD ALREADY DECIDED SOMETHING IN HER MIND THE COUNTESS KNEW THIS BUT WHAT IT MIGHT BE SHE DID NOT KNOW AND THIS ALARMED AND TORMENTED HER NATASHA UNDRESS DARLING LIE DOWN ON MY BED

3168-173564-0017 AND SHE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND OPENED IT THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW THE MOANS OF THE ADJUTANT COULD BE HEARD MORE DISTINCTLY SHE PUT HER HEAD OUT INTO THE DAMP NIGHT AIR AND THE COUNTESS SAW HER SLIM NECK SHAKING WITH SOBS AND THROBBING AGAINST THE WINDOW FRAME
3168-173564-0018 NATASHA KNEW IT WAS NOT PRINCE ANDREW WHO WAS MOANING SHE KNEW PRINCE ANDREW WAS IN THE SAME YARD AS THEMSELVES AND IN A PART OF THE HUT ACROSS THE PASSAGE BUT THIS DREADFUL INCESSANT MOANING MADE HER SOB
3168-173564-0019 THE COUNTESS EXCHANGED A LOOK WITH SONYA LIE DOWN DARLING LIE DOWN MY PET SAID THE COUNTESS SOFTLY TOUCHING NATASHA'S SHOULDERS COME LIE DOWN OH YES
3168-173564-0020 I'LL LIE DOWN AT ONCE SAID NATASHA AND BEGAN HURRIEDLY UNDRESSING TUGGING AT THE TAPES OF HER PETTICOAT WHEN SHE HAD THROWN OFF HER DRESS AND PUT ON A DRESSING JACKET
3168-173564-0021 THAT HAD BEEN MADE UP ON THE FLOOR JERKED HER THIN AND RATHER SHORT PLAIT OF HAIR TO THE FRONT AND BEGAN REPLAITING IT
3168-173564-0022 HER LONG THIN PRACTICED FINGERS RAPIDLY UNPLAITED REPLAITED AND TIED UP HER PLAIT HER HEAD MOVED FROM SIDE TO SIDE FROM HABIT BUT HER EYES FEVERISHLY WIDE
3168-173564-0023 WHEN HER TOILET FOR THE NIGHT WAS FINISHED SHE SANK GENTLY ONTO THE SHEET SPREAD OVER THE HAY ON THE SIDE NEAREST THE DOOR NATASHA YOU'D BETTER LIE IN THE MIDDLE SAID SONYA I'LL STAY HERE MUTTERED NATASHA
3168-173564-0024 DO LIE DOWN SHE ADDED CROSSLY AND BURIED HER FACE IN THE PILLOW THE COUNTESS MADAME SCHOSS AND SONYA UNDRESSED HASTILY AND LAY DOWN THE SMALL LAMP IN FRONT OF THE ICONS WAS THE ONLY LIGHT LEFT IN THE ROOM
3168-173564-0025 BUT IN THE YARD THERE WAS A LIGHT FROM THE FIRE AT LITTLE MYTISHCHI A MILE AND A HALF AWAY AND THROUGH THE NIGHT CAME THE NOISE OF PEOPLE SHOUTING AT A TAVERN MAMONOV'S COSSACKS HAD SET UP ACROSS THE STREET AND THE ADJUTANT'S UNCEASING MOANS
3168-173564-0026 COULD STILL BE HEARD FOR A LONG TIME NATASHA LISTENED ATTENTIVELY TO THE SOUNDS THAT REACHED HER FROM INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE ROOM AND DID NOT MOVE FIRST SHE HEARD HER MOTHER PRAYING AND SIGHING AND THE CREAKING OF HER BED UNDER HER
3168-173564-0027 AND SONYA'S GENTLE BREATHING THEN THE COUNTESS CALLED TO NATASHA NATASHA DID NOT ANSWER I THINK SHE'S ASLEEP MAMMA SAID SONYA SOFTLY
3168-173564-0028 AFTER A SHORT SILENCE THE COUNTESS SPOKE AGAIN BUT THIS TIME NO ONE REPLIED SOON AFTER THAT NATASHA HEARD HER MOTHER'S EVEN BREATHING NATASHA DID NOT MOVE THOUGH HER LITTLE BARE FOOT
3168-173564-0029 THRUST OUT FROM UNDER THE QUILT WAS GROWING COLD ON THE BARE FLOOR AS IF TO CELEBRATE A VICTORY OVER EVERYBODY A CRICKET CHIRPED IN A CRACK IN THE WALL A COCK CROWED FAR OFF AND ANOTHER REPLIED NEAR BY
3168-173564-0030 THE SHOUTING IN THE TAVERN HAD DIED DOWN ONLY THE MOANING OF THE ADJUTANT WAS HEARD NATASHA SAT UP SONYA ARE YOU ASLEEP MAMMA SHE WHISPERED
3168-173564-0031 NO ONE REPLIED NATASHA ROSE SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY CROSSED HERSELF AND STEPPED CAUTIOUSLY ON THE COLD AND DIRTY FLOOR WITH HER SLIM SUPPLE BARE FEET THE BOARDS OF THE FLOOR CREAKED
3168-173564-0032 STEPPING CAUTIOUSLY FROM ONE FOOT TO THE OTHER SHE RAN LIKE A KITTEN THE FEW STEPS TO THE DOOR AND GRASPED THE COLD DOOR HANDLE IT SEEMED TO HER THAT SOMETHING HEAVY WAS BEATING RHYTHMICALLY AGAINST ALL THE WALLS OF THE ROOM
3168-173564-0033 IT WAS HER OWN HEART SINKING WITH ALARM AND TERROR AND OVERFLOWING WITH LOVE SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND STEPPED ACROSS THE THRESHOLD AND ONTO THE COLD DAMP EARTHEN FLOOR OF THE PASSAGE THE COLD SHE FELT REFRESHED HER
3168-173564-0034 WITH HER BARE FEET SHE TOUCHED A SLEEPING MAN STEPPED OVER HIM AND OPENED THE DOOR INTO THE PART OF THE HUT WHERE PRINCE ANDREW LAY IT WAS DARK IN THERE IN THE FARTHEST CORNER ON A BENCH BESIDE A BED
3168-173564-0035 ON WHICH SOMETHING WAS LYING STOOD A TALLOW CANDLE WITH A LONG THICK AND SMOLDERING WICK FROM THE MOMENT SHE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT MORNING OF PRINCE ANDREW'S WOUND AND HIS PRESENCE THERE NATASHA HAD RESOLVED TO SEE HIM
3168-173564-0036 SHE DID NOT KNOW WHY SHE HAD TO SHE KNEW THE MEETING WOULD BE PAINFUL
3168-173564-0037 ALL DAY SHE HAD LIVED ONLY IN HOPE OF SEEING HIM THAT NIGHT BUT NOW THAT THE MOMENT HAD COME SHE WAS FILLED WITH DREAD OF WHAT SHE MIGHT SEE HOW WAS HE MAIMED WHAT WAS LEFT OF HIM
3168-173564-0038 WAS HE LIKE THAT INCESSANT MOANING OF THE ADJUTANT'S YES HE WAS ALTOGETHER LIKE THAT IN HER IMAGINATION HE WAS THAT TERRIBLE MOANING PERSONIFIED WHEN SHE SAW AN INDISTINCT SHAPE IN THE CORNER AND MISTOOK HIS KNEES
3168-173564-0039 RAISED UNDER THE QUILT FOR HIS SHOULDERS SHE IMAGINED A HORRIBLE BODY THERE AND STOOD STILL IN TERROR BUT AN IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE DREW HER FORWARD SHE CAUTIOUSLY TOOK ONE STEP AND THEN ANOTHER
3168-173564-0040 AND FOUND HERSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF A SMALL ROOM CONTAINING BAGGAGE ANOTHER MAN TIMOKHIN WAS LYING IN A CORNER ON THE BENCHES BENEATH THE ICONS AND TWO OTHERS THE DOCTOR AND A VALET LAY ON THE FLOOR
3168-173564-0041 THE VALET SAT UP AND WHISPERED SOMETHING TIMOKHIN KEPT AWAKE BY THE PAIN IN HIS WOUNDED LEG GAZED WITH WIDE OPEN EYES AT THIS STRANGE APPARITION OF A GIRL IN A WHITE
3168-173564-0042 DRESSING JACKET AND NIGHTCAP THE VALET'S SLEEPY FRIGHTENED EXCLAMATION
3168-173564-0043 HORRIBLY UNLIKE A MAN AS THAT BODY LOOKED SHE MUST SEE HIM SHE PASSED THE VALET THE SNUFF FELL FROM THE CANDLE WICK AND SHE SAW PRINCE ANDREW CLEARLY WITH HIS ARMS OUTSIDE THE QUILT
3168-173564-0044 AND SUCH AS SHE HAD ALWAYS SEEN HIM HE WAS THE SAME AS EVER BUT THE FEVERISH COLOR OF HIS FACE HIS GLITTERING EYES RAPTUROUSLY TURNED TOWARD HER AND ESPECIALLY HIS NECK DELICATE AS A CHILD'S
3168-173564-0045 REVEALED BY THE TURN DOWN COLLAR OF HIS SHIRT GAVE HIM A PECULIARLY INNOCENT CHILDLIKE LOOK SUCH AS SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ON HIM BEFORE SHE WENT UP TO HIM AND WITH A SWIFT FLEXIBLE YOUTHFUL MOVEMENT DROPPED ON HER KNEES
3168-173565-0000 SEVEN DAYS HAD PASSED SINCE PRINCE ANDREW FOUND HIMSELF IN THE AMBULANCE STATION ON THE FIELD OF BORODINO HIS FEVERISH STATE AND THE INFLAMMATION OF HIS BOWELS WHICH WERE INJURED
3168-173565-0001 WERE IN THE DOCTOR'S OPINION SURE TO CARRY HIM OFF BUT ON THE SEVENTH DAY HE ATE WITH PLEASURE A PIECE OF BREAD WITH SOME TEA AND THE DOCTOR NOTICED THAT HIS TEMPERATURE WAS LOWER HE HAD REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS THAT MORNING THE FIRST NIGHT AFTER THEY LEFT MOSCOW
3168-173565-0002 HAD BEEN FAIRLY WARM AND HE HAD REMAINED IN THE CALECHE BUT AT MYTISHCHI THE WOUNDED MAN HIMSELF ASKED TO BE TAKEN OUT AND GIVEN SOME TEA THE PAIN CAUSED BY HIS REMOVAL INTO THE HUT HAD MADE HIM GROAN ALOUD AND AGAIN LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS
3168-173565-0003 WHEN HE HAD BEEN PLACED ON HIS CAMP BED HE LAY FOR A LONG TIME MOTIONLESS WITH CLOSED EYES THEN HE OPENED THEM AND WHISPERED SOFTLY AND THE TEA HIS REMEMBERING SUCH A SMALL DETAIL OF EVERYDAY LIFE ASTONISHED THE DOCTOR
3168-173565-0004 HE FELT PRINCE ANDREW'S PULSE AND TO HIS SURPRISE AND DISSATISFACTION FOUND IT HAD IMPROVED HE WAS DISSATISFIED BECAUSE HE KNEW BY EXPERIENCE THAT IF HIS PATIENT DID NOT DIE NOW HE WOULD DO SO A LITTLE LATER WITH GREATER SUFFERING
3168-173565-0005 TIMOKHIN THE RED NOSED MAJOR OF PRINCE ANDREW'S REGIMENT HAD JOINED HIM IN MOSCOW AND WAS BEING TAKEN ALONG WITH HIM HAVING BEEN WOUNDED IN THE LEG AT THE BATTLE OF BORODINO THEY WERE ACCOMPANIED BY A DOCTOR
3168-173565-0006 PRINCE ANDREW'S VALET HIS COACHMAN AND TWO ORDERLIES THEY GAVE PRINCE ANDREW SOME TEA HE DRANK IT EAGERLY LOOKING WITH FEVERISH EYES AT THE DOOR IN FRONT OF HIM AS IF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND REMEMBER SOMETHING
3168-173565-0007 I DON'T WANT ANY MORE IS TIMOKHIN HERE HE ASKED TIMOKHIN CREPT ALONG THE BENCH TO HIM I AM HERE YOUR EXCELLENCY HOW'S YOUR WOUND MINE SIR
3168-173565-0008 PRINCE ANDREW AGAIN PONDERED AS IF TRYING TO REMEMBER SOMETHING COULDN'T ONE GET A BOOK HE ASKED WHAT BOOK THE GOSPELS I HAVEN'T ONE
3168-173565-0009 THE DOCTOR PROMISED TO PROCURE IT FOR HIM AND BEGAN TO ASK HOW HE WAS FEELING PRINCE ANDREW ANSWERED ALL HIS QUESTIONS RELUCTANTLY BUT REASONABLY
3168-173565-0010 AND THEN SAID HE WANTED A BOLSTER PLACED UNDER HIM AS HE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AND IN GREAT PAIN THE DOCTOR AND VALET LIFTED THE CLOAK WITH WHICH HE WAS COVERED AND MAKING WRY FACES AT THE NOISOME SMELL OF MORTIFYING FLESH
3168-173565-0011 THAT CAME FROM THE WOUND BEGAN EXAMINING THAT DREADFUL PLACE THE DOCTOR WAS VERY MUCH DISPLEASED ABOUT SOMETHING AND MADE A CHANGE IN THE DRESSINGS TURNING THE WOUNDED MAN OVER SO THAT HE GROANED AGAIN AND GREW UNCONSCIOUS AND DELIRIOUS FROM THE AGONY
3168-173565-0012 HE KEPT ASKING THEM TO GET HIM THE BOOK AND PUT IT UNDER HIM WHAT TROUBLE WOULD IT BE TO YOU HE SAID
3168-173565-0013 HE PLEADED IN A PITEOUS VOICE THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE PASSAGE TO WASH HIS HANDS YOU FELLOWS HAVE NO CONSCIENCE SAID HE TO THE VALET WHO WAS POURING WATER OVER HIS HANDS
3168-173565-0014 THAT I WONDER HOW HE CAN BEAR IT BY THE LORD JESUS CHRIST I THOUGHT WE HAD PUT SOMETHING UNDER HIM SAID THE VALET THE FIRST TIME PRINCE ANDREW UNDERSTOOD WHERE HE WAS AND WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM AND REMEMBERED BEING WOUNDED AND HOW
3168-173565-0015 WAS WHEN HE ASKED TO BE CARRIED INTO THE HUT AFTER HIS CALECHE HAD STOPPED AT MYTISHCHI AFTER GROWING CONFUSED FROM PAIN WHILE BEING CARRIED INTO THE HUT HE AGAIN REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS AND WHILE DRINKING TEA ONCE MORE RECALLED ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM
3168-173565-0016 AND ABOVE ALL VIVIDLY REMEMBERED THE MOMENT AT THE AMBULANCE STATION WHEN AT THE SIGHT OF THE SUFFERINGS OF A MAN HE DISLIKED THOSE NEW THOUGHTS HAD COME TO HIM WHICH PROMISED HIM HAPPINESS AND THOSE
3168-173565-0017 THOUGHTS THOUGH NOW VAGUE AND INDEFINITE AGAIN POSSESSED HIS SOUL HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD NOW A NEW SOURCE OF HAPPINESS AND THAT THIS HAPPINESS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE GOSPELS THAT WAS WHY HE ASKED FOR A COPY OF THEM
3168-173565-0018 THE UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION IN WHICH THEY HAD PUT HIM AND TURNED HIM OVER AGAIN CONFUSED HIS THOUGHTS AND WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF A THIRD TIME IT WAS IN THE COMPLETE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT EVERYBODY NEAR HIM WAS SLEEPING A CRICKET CHIRPED FROM ACROSS THE PASSAGE
3168-173565-0019 SOMEONE WAS SHOUTING AND SINGING IN THE STREET COCKROACHES RUSTLED ON THE TABLE ON THE ICONS AND ON THE WALLS AND A BIG FLY FLOPPED AT THE HEAD OF THE BED AND AROUND THE CANDLE BESIDE HIM THE WICK OF WHICH WAS CHARRED AND HAD SHAPED ITSELF LIKE A MUSHROOM
3168-173565-0020 HIS MIND WAS NOT IN A NORMAL STATE A HEALTHY MAN USUALLY THINKS OF FEELS AND REMEMBERS INNUMERABLE THINGS SIMULTANEOUSLY BUT HAS THE POWER AND WILL TO SELECT ONE SEQUENCE OF THOUGHTS OR EVENTS ON WHICH TO FIX HIS WHOLE ATTENTION
3168-173565-0021 A HEALTHY MAN CAN TEAR HIMSELF AWAY FROM THE DEEPEST REFLECTIONS TO SAY A CIVIL WORD TO SOMEONE WHO COMES IN AND CAN THEN RETURN AGAIN TO HIS OWN THOUGHTS
3168-173565-0022 ALL THE POWERS OF HIS MIND WERE MORE ACTIVE AND CLEARER THAN EVER BUT THEY ACTED APART FROM HIS WILL MOST DIVERSE THOUGHTS AND IMAGES OCCUPIED HIM SIMULTANEOUSLY AT TIMES HIS BRAIN SUDDENLY BEGAN TO WORK WITH A VIGOR CLEARNESS AND DEPTH
3168-173565-0023 IT HAD NEVER REACHED WHEN HE WAS IN HEALTH BUT SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF ITS WORK IT WOULD TURN TO SOME UNEXPECTED IDEA AND HE HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO TURN IT BACK AGAIN YES A NEW HAPPINESS WAS REVEALED TO ME OF WHICH MAN CANNOT BE DEPRIVED
3168-173565-0024 HE THOUGHT AS HE LAY IN THE SEMIDARKNESS OF THE QUIET HUT GAZING FIXEDLY BEFORE HIM WITH FEVERISH WIDE OPEN EYES A HAPPINESS LYING BEYOND MATERIAL FORCES OUTSIDE THE MATERIAL INFLUENCES THAT ACT ON MAN
3168-173565-0025 EVERY MAN CAN UNDERSTAND IT BUT TO CONCEIVE IT AND ENJOIN IT WAS POSSIBLE ONLY FOR GOD BUT HOW DID GOD ENJOIN THAT LAW AND WHY WAS THE SON AND SUDDENLY THE SEQUENCE OF THESE THOUGHTS BROKE OFF
3168-173565-0026 AND PRINCE ANDREW HEARD WITHOUT KNOWING WHETHER IT WAS A DELUSION OR REALITY A SOFT WHISPERING VOICE INCESSANTLY AND RHYTHMICALLY REPEATING PITI PITI PITI AND THEN
3168-173565-0027 AND TI TI ONCE MORE AT THE SAME TIME HE FELT THAT ABOVE HIS FACE ABOVE THE VERY MIDDLE OF IT SOME STRANGE AIRY STRUCTURE WAS BEING ERECTED OUT OF SLENDER NEEDLES OR SPLINTERS
3168-173565-0028 TO THE SOUND OF THIS WHISPERED MUSIC HE FELT THAT HE HAD TO BALANCE CAREFULLY THOUGH IT WAS DIFFICULT SO THAT THIS AIRY STRUCTURE SHOULD NOT COLLAPSE BUT NEVERTHELESS IT KEPT COLLAPSING AND AGAIN SLOWLY RISING TO THE SOUND OF
3168-173565-0029 WHISPERED RHYTHMIC MUSIC IT STRETCHES STRETCHES SPREADING OUT AND STRETCHING SAID PRINCE ANDREW TO HIMSELF WHILE LISTENING TO THIS WHISPERING AND FEELING THE SENSATION OF THIS DRAWING OUT AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS EDIFICE OF NEEDLES
3168-173565-0030 HE ALSO SAW BY GLIMPSES A RED HALO ROUND THE CANDLE AND HEARD THE RUSTLE OF THE COCKROACHES AND THE BUZZING OF THE FLY THAT FLOPPED AGAINST HIS PILLOW AND HIS FACE
3168-173565-0031 EACH TIME THE FLY TOUCHED HIS FACE IT GAVE HIM A BURNING SENSATION AND YET TO HIS SURPRISE IT DID NOT DESTROY THE STRUCTURE THOUGH IT KNOCKED AGAINST THE VERY REGION OF HIS FACE WHERE IT WAS RISING
3168-173565-0032 WHICH ALSO OPPRESSED HIM BUT PERHAPS THAT'S MY SHIRT ON THE TABLE HE THOUGHT AND THAT'S MY LEGS AND THAT IS THE DOOR BUT WHY IS IT ALWAYS STRETCHING AND DRAWING ITSELF OUT AND
3168-173565-0033 PITI PITI PITI AND TI TI AND PITI PITI PITI THAT'S ENOUGH PLEASE LEAVE OFF PRINCE ANDREW PAINFULLY ENTREATED SOMEONE AND SUDDENLY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS AGAIN SWAM TO THE SURFACE OF HIS MIND WITH PECULIAR CLEARNESS AND FORCE
3168-173565-0034 FOR SOME PURPOSE OR FOR SOME REASON BUT THE LOVE WHICH I WHILE DYING FIRST EXPERIENCED WHEN I SAW MY ENEMY AND YET LOVED HIM I EXPERIENCED THAT FEELING OF LOVE WHICH IS THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE SOUL AND DOES NOT REQUIRE AN OBJECT
3168-173565-0035 NOW AGAIN I FEEL THAT BLISS TO LOVE ONE'S NEIGHBORS
3168-173565-0036 BUT AN ENEMY CAN ONLY BE LOVED BY DIVINE LOVE
3168-173565-0037 IS HE ALIVE WHEN LOVING WITH HUMAN LOVE ONE MAY PASS FROM LOVE TO HATRED BUT DIVINE LOVE CANNOT CHANGE NO NEITHER DEATH NOR ANYTHING ELSE CAN DESTROY IT IT IS THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE SOUL
3168-173565-0038 YET HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE I HATED IN MY LIFE AND OF THEM ALL I LOVED AND HATED NONE AS I DID HER
3168-173565-0039 NOT AS HE HAD DONE IN THE PAST WITH NOTHING BUT HER CHARMS WHICH GAVE HIM DELIGHT BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME PICTURING TO HIMSELF HER SOUL AND HE UNDERSTOOD HER FEELINGS HER SUFFERINGS SHAME AND REMORSE
3168-173565-0040 IF ONLY IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR ME TO SEE HER ONCE MORE JUST ONCE LOOKING INTO THOSE EYES TO SAY PITI PITI PITI AND
3168-173565-0041 TI TI AND PITI PITI PITI BOOM FLOPPED THE FLY AND HIS ATTENTION WAS SUDDENLY CARRIED INTO ANOTHER WORLD
3168-173565-0042 AND DELIRIUM IN WHICH SOMETHING PARTICULAR WAS HAPPENING IN THAT WORLD SOME STRUCTURE WAS STILL BEING ERECTED AND DID NOT FALL SOMETHING WAS STILL STRETCHING OUT AND THE CANDLE WITH ITS RED HALO WAS STILL BURNING
3168-173565-0043 BUT BESIDES ALL THIS SOMETHING CREAKED THERE WAS A WHIFF OF FRESH AIR AND A NEW WHITE SPHINX APPEARED STANDING AT THE DOOR AND THAT SPHINX HAD THE PALE FACE AND SHINING EYES OF THE VERY NATASHA OF WHOM HE HAD JUST BEEN THINKING
3168-173565-0044 OH HOW OPPRESSIVE THIS CONTINUAL DELIRIUM IS THOUGHT PRINCE ANDREW TRYING TO DRIVE THAT FACE FROM HIS IMAGINATION BUT THE FACE REMAINED BEFORE HIM WITH THE FORCE OF REALITY AND DREW NEARER
3168-173565-0045 BUT HE COULD NOT AND DELIRIUM DREW HIM BACK INTO ITS DOMAIN THE SOFT WHISPERING VOICE CONTINUED ITS RHYTHMIC MURMUR SOMETHING OPPRESSED HIM AND STRETCHED OUT AND THE STRANGE FACE WAS BEFORE HIM
3168-173565-0046 HE MOVED A LITTLE AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS A RINGING IN HIS EARS
3168-173565-0047 WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF NATASHA THAT SAME LIVING NATASHA WHOM OF ALL PEOPLE HE MOST LONGED TO LOVE WITH THIS NEW PURE DIVINE LOVE THAT HAD BEEN REVEALED TO HIM WAS KNEELING BEFORE HIM
3168-173565-0048 HE REALIZED THAT IT WAS THE REAL LIVING NATASHA AND HE WAS NOT SURPRISED BUT QUIETLY HAPPY NATASHA MOTIONLESS ON HER KNEES SHE WAS UNABLE TO STIR
3168-173565-0049 WITH FRIGHTENED EYES RIVETED ON HIM WAS RESTRAINING HER SOBS HER FACE WAS PALE AND RIGID ONLY IN THE LOWER PART OF IT SOMETHING QUIVERED PRINCE ANDREW SIGHED WITH RELIEF SMILED
3168-173565-0050 AND HELD OUT HIS HAND YOU HE SAID HOW FORTUNATE WITH A RAPID BUT CAREFUL MOVEMENT NATASHA DREW NEARER TO HIM ON HER KNEES AND TAKING HIS HAND CAREFULLY
3168-173565-0051 JUST TOUCHING IT LIGHTLY WITH HER LIPS FORGIVE ME SHE WHISPERED RAISING HER HEAD AND GLANCING AT HIM FORGIVE ME I LOVE YOU SAID PRINCE ANDREW
3168-173565-0052 FORGIVE WHAT HE ASKED
3168-173565-0053 BROKEN WHISPER AND BEGAN KISSING HIS HAND MORE RAPIDLY JUST TOUCHING IT WITH HER LIPS I LOVE YOU MORE BETTER THAN BEFORE SAID PRINCE ANDREW LIFTING HER FACE WITH HIS HAND
3168-173565-0054 SO AS TO LOOK INTO HER EYES THOSE EYES FILLED WITH HAPPY TEARS GAZED AT HIM TIMIDLY COMPASSIONATELY AND WITH JOYOUS LOVE NATASHA'S THIN PALE FACE WITH ITS SWOLLEN LIPS
3168-173565-0055 WAS MORE THAN PLAIN IT WAS DREADFUL BUT PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT SEE THAT HE SAW HER SHINING EYES WHICH WERE BEAUTIFUL THEY HEARD THE SOUND OF VOICES BEHIND THEM PETER THE VALET WHO WAS NOW WIDE AWAKE HAD ROUSED THE DOCTOR
3168-173565-0056 TIMOKHIN WHO HAD NOT SLEPT AT ALL BECAUSE OF THE PAIN IN HIS LEG HAD LONG BEEN WATCHING ALL THAT WAS GOING ON CAREFULLY COVERING HIS BARE BODY WITH THE SHEET AS HE HUDDLED UP ON HIS BENCH WHAT'S THIS SAID THE DOCTOR RISING FROM HIS BED
3168-173565-0057 PLEASE GO AWAY MADAM AT THAT MOMENT A MAID SENT BY THE COUNTESS WHO HAD NOTICED HER DAUGHTER'S ABSENCE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR LIKE A SOMNAMBULIST
3168-173565-0058 FELL SOBBING ON HER BED FROM THAT TIME DURING ALL THE REST OF THE ROSTOVS JOURNEY AT EVERY HALTING PLACE AND WHEREVER THEY SPENT A NIGHT NATASHA NEVER LEFT THE WOUNDED BOLKONSKI
3168-173565-0059 AND THE DOCTOR HAD TO ADMIT THAT HE HAD NOT EXPECTED FROM A YOUNG GIRL EITHER SUCH FIRMNESS OR SUCH SKILL IN NURSING A WOUNDED MAN DREADFUL AS THE COUNTESS IMAGINED IT WOULD BE SHOULD PRINCE ANDREW DIE IN HER DAUGHTER'S ARMS DURING THE JOURNEY
3168-173565-0060 AS JUDGING BY WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID IT SEEMED MIGHT EASILY HAPPEN SHE COULD NOT OPPOSE NATASHA THOUGH WITH THE INTIMACY NOW ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE WOUNDED MAN AND NATASHA THE THOUGHT OCCURRED THAT SHOULD HE RECOVER THEIR FORMER ENGAGEMENT WOULD BE RENEWED
3168-173565-0061 NO ONE LEAST OF ALL NATASHA AND PRINCE ANDREW SPOKE OF THIS THE UNSETTLED QUESTION OF LIFE AND DEATH WHICH HUNG NOT ONLY OVER BOLKONSKI BUT OVER ALL RUSSIA
32-21625-0000 WAS NOT THE ONLY VILLAGE TO BE SEEN FROM BLUE MOUNTAIN THERE WAS ANOTHER WHICH FARMER GREEN SELDOM VISITED BECAUSE IT LAY BEYOND THE MOUNTAIN AND WAS A LONG DISTANCE FROM HIS HOUSE THOUGH HE OWNED THE LAND WHERE IT STOOD
32-21625-0001 THOSE THAT LIVED THERE THOUGHT THEY HAD EVERY RIGHT TO STAY THERE AS LONG AS THEY PLEASED WITHOUT BEING DISTURBED IT WAS IN THIS VILLAGE THAT BROWNIE BEAVER AND HIS NEIGHBORS LIVED IT WAS A DIFFERENT SORT OF TOWN TOO
32-21625-0002 FROM THE ONE WHERE FARMER GREEN WENT EACH WEEK OVER BEYOND BLUE MOUNTAIN ALL THE HOUSES WERE BUILT IN A POND AND ALL THEIR DOORS WERE UNDER WATER BUT NOBODY MINDED THAT BECAUSE LIKE BROWNIE BEAVER
32-21625-0003 EVERYBODY THAT DWELT THERE WAS A FINE SWIMMER YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE BROWNIE'S TIME HIS FOREFATHERS HAD COME THERE AND FINDING THAT THERE WERE MANY TREES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THE SORT OF BARK THEY LIKED TO EAT
32-21625-0004 SUCH AS POPLARS WILLOWS AND BOX ELDERS THEY HAD DECIDED THAT IT WAS A GOOD PLACE TO LIVE THERE WAS A SMALL STREAM TOO WHICH WAS REALLY THE BEGINNING OF SWIFT RIVER
32-21625-0005 AND BY DAMMING IT THOSE OLD SETTLERS MADE A POND IN WHICH THEY COULD BUILD THEIR HOUSES THEY HAD IDEAS OF THEIR OWN AS TO WHAT A HOUSE SHOULD BE LIKE
32-21625-0006 THOUGH YOU PERHAPS MIGHT NOT CARE FOR THEM AT ALL THEY WANTED THEIR HOUSES TO BE SURROUNDED BY WATER BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE SAFER WHEN BUILT IN THAT MANNER AND THEY ALWAYS INSISTED THAT A DOOR LEADING INTO A HOUSE
32-21625-0007 SHOULD BE FAR BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER FOR THEY BELIEVED THAT THAT MADE A HOUSE SAFER TOO TO YOU SUCH AN IDEA MAY SEEM VERY STRANGE BUT IF YOU WERE CHASED BY AN ENEMY YOU MIGHT BE GLAD TO BE ABLE TO SWIM UNDER WATER
32-21625-0008 DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF A POND AND SLIP INSIDE A DOOR WHICH LED TO A WINDING HALL
32-21625-0009 OF COURSE YOUR ENEMY MIGHT BE ABLE TO SWIM AS WELL AS YOU BUT MAYBE HE WOULD THINK TWICE OR EVEN THREE TIMES BEFORE HE WENT PROWLING THROUGH YOUR CROOKED HALL FOR IF YOU HAD ENORMOUS STRONG SHARP TEETH
32-21625-0010 WITH WHICH YOU COULD GNAW RIGHT THROUGH A TREE HE WOULD NOT CARE TO HAVE YOU SEIZE HIM AS HE POKED HIS HEAD AROUND A CORNER IN A DARK PASSAGE OF A STRANGE HOUSE IT WAS IN A HOUSE OF THAT KIND THAT BROWNIE BEAVER LIVED
32-21625-0011 AND HE BUILT IT HIMSELF BECAUSE HE SAID HE WOULD RATHER HAVE A NEAT NEW HOUSE THAN ONE OF THE BIG OLD DWELLINGS THAT HAD BEEN BUILT MANY YEARS BEFORE WHEN HIS GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER HAD HELPED THROW THE DAM ACROSS THE STREAM THE DAM WAS THERE STILL
32-21625-0012 IT WAS SO OLD THAT TREES WERE GROWING ON IT AND THERE WAS AN ODD THING ABOUT IT IT WAS NEVER FINISHED THOUGH BROWNIE BEAVER WAS A YOUNG CHAP HE WORKED ON THE DAM SOMETIMES LIKE ALL HIS NEIGHBORS
32-21625-0013 YOU SEE THE VILLAGERS KEPT MAKING THE DAM WIDER AND SINCE IT WAS BUILT OF STICKS AND MUD THE WATER SOMETIMES WASHED BITS OF IT AWAY SO IT HAD TO BE KEPT IN REPAIR IF BROWNIE BEAVER AND HIS FRIENDS HAD NEGLECTED THEIR DAM
32-21625-0014 AND WITHOUT ANY WATER TO HIDE THEIR DOORWAYS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE NO LONGER THEY WOULD HAVE HAD NO PLACE EITHER TO STORE THEIR WINTER'S FOOD FOR THEY WERE IN THE HABIT OF CUTTING DOWN TREES AND SAVING THE BARK AND BRANCHES TOO
32-21625-0015 IN ORDER TO HAVE PLENTY TO EAT WHEN COLD WEATHER CAME AND THE ICE CLOSED THEIR POND SOME OF THEIR FOOD THEY CARRIED INTO THEIR HOUSES THROUGH A STRAIGHT HALL WHICH WAS MADE FOR THAT VERY PURPOSE
32-21625-0016 AND SOME OF THE BRANCHES THEY FASTENED UNDER WATER NEAR THE DAM IT WAS JUST LIKE PUTTING GREEN THINGS INTO A REFRIGERATOR SO THEY WILL KEEP NOW YOU SEE WHY BROWNIE BEAVER WOULD NO MORE HAVE THOUGHT OF BUILDING HIS HOUSE ON DRY LAND
32-21625-0017 THAN YOU WOULD THINK OF BUILDING ONE IN A POND EVERYBODY LIKES HIS OWN WAY BEST AND IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO BROWNIE BEAVER THAT HIS WAY WAS THE LEAST BIT STRANGE
32-21631-0000 AFTER MISTER CROW FLEW BACK TO PLEASANT VALLEY TO GATHER NEWS FOR HIM BROWNIE BEAVER CAREFULLY COUNTED EACH DAY THAT PASSED SINCE MISTER CROW HAD AGREED TO BE HIS NEWSPAPER AND COME EACH SATURDAY AFTERNOON TO TELL HIM EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED DURING THE WEEK
32-21631-0001 BROWNIE WAS IN A GREAT HURRY FOR SATURDAY TO ARRIVE IN ORDER TO MAKE NO MISTAKE HE PUT ASIDE A STICK IN WHICH HE GNAWED A NOTCH EACH DAY AND IN THAT WAY HE KNEW EXACTLY WHEN SATURDAY CAME
32-21631-0002 THAT WAS PROBABLY THE LONGEST DAY IN BROWNIE BEAVER'S LIFE AT LEAST IT SEEMED SO TO HIM WHENEVER HE SAW A BIRD SOARING ABOVE THE TREE TOPS HE COULDN'T HELP HOPING IT WAS MISTER CROW
32-21631-0003 BROWNIE BEAVER DROPPED WHATEVER HE HAPPENED TO BE DOING EXPECTING THAT MISTER CROW WOULD FLAP INTO SIGHT AT ANY MOMENT BROWNIE HAD MANY DISAPPOINTMENTS BUT MISTER CROW REALLY CAME AT LAST
32-21631-0004 HE LIGHTED RIGHT ON TOP OF BROWNIE BEAVER'S HOUSE AND CALLED PAPER DOWN THE CHIMNEY JUST LIKE THAT BROWNIE HAPPENED TO BE INSIDE HIS HOUSE AND IN A WONDERFULLY SHORT TIME HIS HEAD APPEARED
32-21631-0005 ABOVE THE WATER AND HE SOON CRAWLED UP BESIDE MISTER CROW WELL I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU HE TOLD MISTER CROW PETER MINK CAUGHT A MONSTROUS EEL IN THE DUCK POND ON MONDAY MISTER CROW SAID
32-21631-0006 BEING A NEWSPAPER HE THOUGHT HE OUGHT TO SAY NOTHING EXCEPT WHAT WAS NEWS NOT EVEN GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER RABBIT OF PINE RIDGE WITH HIS WIFE AND FOURTEEN CHILDREN IS VISITING HIS BROTHER MISTER JEREMIAH RABBIT
32-21631-0007 MISTER CROW CONTINUED TO RELATE IN A SINGSONG VOICE GOODNESS GRACIOUS BROWNIE BEAVER EXCLAIMED FATTY COON MISTER CROW SAID FATTY COON WAS CONFINED TO HIS HOUSE BY ILLNESS TUESDAY NIGHT
32-21631-0008 HE ATE TOO MANY DRIED APPLES WELL WELL BROWNIE BEAVER MURMURED AND HE STARTED TO ASK MISTER CROW A QUESTION BUT MISTER CROW INTERRUPTED HIM WITH MORE NEWS
32-21631-0009 MISSUS BEAR HAD A BIRTHDAY ON WEDNESDAY AN ENJOYABLE TIME WAS HAD BY ALL EXCEPT THE PIG PIG BROWNIE BEAVER ASKED WHAT PIG THE PIG THEY ATE SAID MISTER CROW
32-21631-0010 AND HE WENT RIGHT ON TALKING ON THURSDAY MISTER WOODCHUCK WENT TO VISIT HIS COUSINS IN THE WEST MISSUS WOODCHUCK IS WORRIED WHAT'S SHE WORRIED ABOUT BROWNIE INQUIRED SHE'S AFRAID HE'S COMING BACK AGAIN
32-21631-0011 MISTER CROW EXPLAINED I HAVE HEARD HE WAS LAZY BROWNIE SAID WHAT HAPPENED ON FRIDAY TOMMY FOX MADE A VISIT BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD TIME AT ALL MISTER CROW REPORTED
32-21631-0012 AND HE LEFT FASTER THAN HE CAME BROWNIE BEAVER WANTED TO KNOW WHERE TOMMY FOX MADE HIS VISIT AT FARMER GREEN'S HEN HOUSE MISTER CROW EXPLAINED WHY DID HE HURRY AWAY BROWNIE ASKED
32-21631-0013 OLD DOG SPOT CHASED HIM MISTER CROW REPLIED BUT YOU MUSTN'T ASK QUESTIONS HE COMPLAINED YOU CAN'T ASK QUESTIONS OF A NEWSPAPER YOU KNOW WELL WHAT HAPPENED ON SATURDAY
32-21631-0014 ANOTHER QUESTION I DECLARE I DON'T BELIEVE YOU EVER TOOK A NEWSPAPER BEFORE DID YOU BROWNIE BEAVER ADMITTED THAT HE NEVER HAD THEN SAID MISTER CROW THEN DON'T INTERRUPT ME AGAIN PLEASE
32-21631-0015 I'LL TELL YOU ALL THE NEWS I'VE BROUGHT AND WHEN I'VE FINISHED I'LL STOP BEING A NEWSPAPER AND BE MYSELF FOR A WHILE AND THEN WE CAN TALK BUT NOT BEFORE HE INSISTED BROWNIE BEAVER NODDED HIS HEAD
32-21631-0016 HE WAS AFRAID THAT IF HE SAID ANOTHER WORD MISTER CROW WOULD GROW ANGRY AND FLY AWAY WITHOUT TELLING HIM ANY MORE NEWS
32-21631-0017 JIMMY RABBIT ALMOST CUT OFF FRISKY SQUIRREL'S TAIL MISTER CROW PAUSED AND LOOKED AT BROWNIE BEAVER OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE HE KNEW THAT BROWNIE WOULD WANT TO KNOW WHAT PREVENTED THE ACCIDENT BUT HE WAS IN NO HURRY TO TELL HIM
32-21631-0018 FOR A FEW MOMENTS BROWNIE WAITED TO HEAR THE REST BUT A FEW MOMENTS WAS MORE THAN HE COULD ENDURE WHY DIDN'T JIMMY CUT OFF HIS TAIL BROWNIE ASKED EAGERLY THERE SAID MISTER CROW YOU'VE DONE JUST AS I TOLD YOU NOT TO
32-21631-0019 SO I SHALL NOT TELL YOU THE REST UNTIL NEXT SATURDAY YOU SEE YOU HAVE A FEW THINGS TO LEARN ABOUT TAKING A NEWSPAPER
32-21634-0000 THERE WAS GREAT REJOICING IN THE LITTLE VILLAGE IN THE POND WHEN BROWNIE BEAVER RETURNED WITH THE GOOD NEWS THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE HUNTING AND FISHING AND WHEN OLD GRANDADDY BEAVER SAID THAT EVERYBODY OUGHT TO TAKE A HOLIDAY TO CELEBRATE THE OCCASION
32-21634-0001 ALL THE VILLAGERS SAID IT WAS A FINE IDEA SO THEY STOPPED WORKING FOR ONCE AND BEGAN TO PLAN THE CELEBRATION THEY THOUGHT THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE SWIMMING RACES AND TREE FELLING CONTESTS
32-21634-0002 AND BROWNIE BEAVER SAID THAT AFTER THE HOLIDAY WAS OVER HE WOULD SUGGEST THAT SOMEONE BE CHOSEN TO GO DOWN AND THANK FARMER GREEN FOR PUTTING THE NOTICE ON THE TREE THE WHOLE VILLAGE AGREED TO BROWNIE'S PROPOSAL
32-21634-0003 BROWNIE BEAVER HIMSELF PASSED HIS HAT AROUND TO TAKE UP THE VOTES AND IT WAS QUICKLY FOUND THAT EVERY VOTE WAS FOR BROWNIE BEAVER HE HAD EVEN VOTED FOR HIMSELF BUT NO ONE SEEMED TO CARE ABOUT THAT
32-21634-0004 AND ANOTHER IN WHICH EACH PERSON WHO TOOK PART HAD TO STAY BENEATH THE SURFACE AS LONG AS HE COULD THAT LAST RACE CAUSED SOME TROUBLE A YOUNG SCAMP CALLED SLIPPERY SAM WON IT AND MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD SWUM UP INSIDE HIS HOUSE
32-21634-0005 WHERE HE COULD GET AIR WITHOUT BEING SEEN BUT NO ONE COULD PROVE IT SO HE WON THE RACE JUST THE SAME NEXT CAME THE TREE FELLING CONTEST THERE WERE SIX INCLUDING BROWNIE BEAVER THAT TOOK PART IN IT
32-21634-0006 GRANDADDY BEAVER HAD PICKED OUT SIX TREES OF EXACTLY THE SAME SIZE EACH PERSON IN THE CONTEST HAD TO TRY TO BRING HIS TREE TO THE GROUND FIRST AND THAT CAUSED SOME TROUBLE TOO BECAUSE SOME CLAIMED THAT THEIR TREES WERE OF HARDER WOOD THAN OTHERS
32-21634-0007 AND MORE DIFFICULT TO GNAW WHILE OTHERS COMPLAINED THAT THE BARK OF THEIR TREES TASTED VERY BITTER AND OF COURSE THAT MADE THEIR TASK UNPLEASANT THOSE SIX TREES FALLING ONE AFTER ANOTHER MADE SUCH A RACKET
32-21634-0008 THAT OLD MISTER CROW HEARD THE NOISE MILES AWAY AND FLEW OVER TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING AFTER EVERYBODY CREPT OUT OF HIS HIDING PLACE SOME TIME AFTERWARD EVERYONE HAD TO HIDE FOR A WHILE YOU KNOW
32-21634-0009 THERE WAS MISTER CROW SITTING UPON ONE OF THE FALLEN TREES
32-21634-0010 THEN THEY TOLD HIM ABOUT THE CELEBRATION AND MISTER CROW BEGAN TO LAUGH WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NEXT HE ASKED WE'RE A GOING TO SEND BROWNIE BEAVER OVER TO PLEASANT VALLEY
32-21634-0011 TO THANK FARMER GREEN FOR HIS KINDNESS IN PUTTING AN END TO HUNTING AND FISHING SAID OLD GRANDADDY BEAVER AND HE'S A GOING TO START RIGHT AWAY MISTER CROW LOOKED AROUND AND THERE WAS BROWNIE BEAVER
32-21634-0012 WITH A LUNCH BASKET IN HIS HAND ALL READY TO BEGIN HIS LONG JOURNEY SAY GOOD BY TO HIM THEN SAID MISTER CROW FOR YOU'LL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN GRANDADDY BEAVER ASKED
32-21634-0013 AND AS FOR BROWNIE HE WAS SO FRIGHTENED THAT HE DROPPED HIS BASKET RIGHT IN THE WATER I MEAN SAID MISTER CROW
32-21634-0014 YOU DON'T SEEM TO HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT SIGN IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WAS NOT FARMER GREEN BUT HIS SON JOHNNIE WHO NAILED IT TO THE TREE
32-21634-0015 THAT IS WHY ONE OF THE WORDS WAS MISSPELLED NO DOUBT MISTER CROW REMARKED AS A MATTER OF FACT NOT BEING ABLE TO READ HE HADN'T KNOWN ABOUT THE WORD THAT WAS SPELLED WRONG IN THE SECOND PLACE HE CONTINUED
32-21634-0016 THE SIGN DOESN'T MEAN THAT HUNTING AND FISHING ARE TO BE STOPPED IT MEANS THAT NO ONE BUT JOHNNIE GREEN IS GOING TO HUNT AND FISH IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
32-21634-0017 AND INSTEAD OF HUNTING AND FISHING BEING STOPPED
32-21634-0018 HE ADDED THAT JOHNNIE GREEN HAD A NEW GUN ON THIS BIRTHDAY BROWNIE BEAVER SAID AT ONCE THAT HE WAS NOT GOING ON THE ERRAND OF THANKS I RESIGN HE SAID AND ANYONE THAT WANTS TO GO IN MY PLACE IS WELCOME TO DO SO
32-21634-0019 BUT NOBODY CARED TO GO AND THE WHOLE VILLAGE SEEMED GREATLY DISAPPOINTED UNTIL GRANDADDY BEAVER MADE A SHORT SPEECH
32-4137-0000 CHAPTER TWO GOING TO THE SOUTH MY COUNTRY SHALL THY HONOURED NAME BE AS A BYE WORD THROUGH THE WORLD ROUSE FOR AS IF TO BLAST THY FAME THIS KEEN REPROACH IS AT THEE HURLED
32-4137-0001 THE BANNER THAT ABOVE THE WAVES IS FLOATING O'ER THREE MILLION SLAVES DICK WALKER THE SLAVE SPECULATOR WHO HAD PURCHASED CURRER AND ALTHESA PUT THEM IN PRISON UNTIL HIS GANG WAS MADE UP
32-4137-0002 AND THEN WITH HIS FORTY SLAVES STARTED FOR THE NEW ORLEANS MARKET AS MANY OF THE SLAVES HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP IN RICHMOND AND HAD RELATIONS RESIDING THERE THE SLAVE TRADER DETERMINED TO LEAVE THE CITY EARLY IN THE MORNING
32-4137-0003 SO AS NOT TO WITNESS ANY OF THOSE SCENES SO COMMON WHERE SLAVES ARE SEPARATED FROM THEIR RELATIVES AND FRIENDS WHEN ABOUT DEPARTING FOR THE SOUTHERN MARKET THIS PLAN WAS SUCCESSFUL FOR NOT EVEN CLOTEL WHO HAD BEEN EVERY DAY AT THE PRISON TO SEE HER MOTHER AND SISTER
32-4137-0004 KNEW OF THEIR DEPARTURE A MARCH OF EIGHT DAYS THROUGH THE INTERIOR OF THE STATE AND THEY ARRIVED ON THE BANKS OF THE OHIO RIVER WHERE THEY WERE ALL PUT ON BOARD A STEAMER AND THEN SPEEDILY SAILED FOR THE PLACE OF THEIR DESTINATION
32-4137-0005 WALKER HAD ALREADY ADVERTISED IN THE NEW ORLEANS PAPERS THAT HE WOULD BE THERE AT A STATED TIME WITH A PRIME LOT OF ABLE BODIED SLAVES READY FOR FIELD SERVICE TOGETHER WITH A FEW EXTRA ONES BETWEEN THE AGES OF FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE
32-4137-0006 BUT LIKE MOST WHO MAKE A BUSINESS OF BUYING AND SELLING SLAVES FOR GAIN HE OFTEN BOUGHT SOME WHO WERE FAR ADVANCED IN YEARS AND WOULD ALWAYS TRY TO SELL THEM FOR FIVE OR TEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN THEY ACTUALLY WERE
32-4137-0007 FEW PERSONS CAN ARRIVE AT ANYTHING LIKE THE AGE OF A NEGRO BY MERE OBSERVATION UNLESS THEY ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE RACE THEREFORE THE SLAVE TRADER VERY FREQUENTLY CARRIED OUT THIS DECEPTION WITH PERFECT IMPUNITY AFTER THE STEAMER HAD LEFT THE WHARF
32-4137-0008 AND INSTRUCTED HIM AS TO GETTING THE NEGROES READY FOR MARKET AMONGST THE FORTY NEGROES WERE SEVERAL WHOSE APPEARANCE INDICATED THAT THEY HAD SEEN SOME YEARS AND HAD GONE THROUGH SOME SERVICES
32-4137-0009 THEIR GREY HAIR AND WHISKERS AT ONCE PRONOUNCED THEM TO BE ABOVE THE AGES SET DOWN IN THE TRADER'S ADVERTISEMENT
32-4137-0010 AND IF HE DID NOT TAKE DELIGHT IN DISCHARGING HIS DUTY HE DID IT WITH A DEGREE OF ALACRITY SO THAT HE MIGHT RECEIVE THE APPROBATION OF HIS MASTER POMP AS WALKER USUALLY CALLED HIM WAS OF REAL NEGRO BLOOD AND WOULD OFTEN SAY WHEN ALLUDING TO HIMSELF
32-4137-0011 DIS NIGGER IS NO COUNTEFIT HE IS DE GENEWINE ARTEKIL
32-4137-0012 HAD A SET OF TEETH WHICH FOR WHITENESS AND BEAUTY COULD NOT BE SURPASSED HIS EYES LARGE LIPS THICK AND HAIR SHORT AND WOOLLY
32-4137-0013 THAT HE APPEARED PERFECTLY INDIFFERENT TO THE HEARTRENDING SCENES WHICH DAILY OCCURRED IN HIS PRESENCE IT WAS ON THE SECOND DAY OF THE STEAMER'S VOYAGE THAT POMPEY SELECTED FIVE OF THE OLD SLAVES TOOK THEM IN A ROOM BY THEMSELVES AND COMMENCED PREPARING THEM FOR THE MARKET
32-4137-0014 WELL SAID POMPEY ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO THE COMPANY I IS DE GENTMAN DAT IS TO GET YOU READY SO DAT YOU WILL BRING MARSER A GOOD PRICE IN DE ORLEANS MARKET HOW OLD IS YOU
32-4137-0015 ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO A MAN WHO FROM APPEARANCE WAS NOT LESS THAN FORTY IF I LIVE TO SEE NEXT CORN PLANTING TIME I WILL EITHER BE FORTY FIVE OR FIFTY FIVE I DON'T KNOW WHICH
32-4137-0016 BUT NOW YOU IS ONLY THIRTY YEARS OLD DAT IS WHAT MARSER SAYS YOU IS TO BE I KNOW I IS MORE DEN DAT RESPONDED THE MAN I KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT DAT
32-4137-0017 BUT WHEN YOU GET IN DE MARKET AN ANYBODY AXE YOU HOW OLD YOU IS AN YOU TELL EM FORTY FIVE MARSER WILL TIE YOU UP AN GIB YOU DE WHIP LIKE SMOKE
32-4137-0018 WELL DEN I GUESS I WILL ONLY BE THIRTY WHEN DEY AXE ME REPLIED THE CHATTEL

32-4137-0021 YOU IS NOW TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD AN NO MORE DUS YOU HEAR DAT YES RESPONDED TOBY
32-4137-0022 AND THEN REPORTED TO HIS MASTER THAT THE OLD BOYS WERE ALL RIGHT AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THE EVENING OF THE THIRD DAY THE LIGHTS OF ANOTHER STEAMER WERE SEEN IN THE DISTANCE AND APPARENTLY COMING UP VERY FAST THIS WAS A SIGNAL FOR A GENERAL COMMOTION ON THE PATRIOT
32-4137-0023 AND EVERYTHING INDICATED THAT A STEAMBOAT RACE WAS AT HAND NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE EXCITEMENT ATTENDANT UPON A STEAMBOAT RACE ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER BY THE TIME THE BOATS HAD REACHED MEMPHIS THEY WERE SIDE BY SIDE
32-4137-0024 AND EACH EXERTING ITSELF TO KEEP THE ASCENDANCY IN POINT OF SPEED THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR THE MOON SHINING BRIGHTLY AND THE BOATS SO NEAR TO EACH OTHER THAT THE PASSENGERS WERE CALLING OUT FROM ONE BOAT TO THE OTHER
32-4137-0025 ON BOARD THE PATRIOT THE FIREMEN WERE USING OIL LARD BUTTER AND EVEN BACON WITH THE WOOD FOR THE PURPOSE OF RAISING THE STEAM TO ITS HIGHEST PITCH THE BLAZE MINGLED WITH THE BLACK SMOKE SHOWED PLAINLY THAT THE OTHER BOAT WAS BURNING MORE THAN WOOD
32-4137-0026 THE TWO BOATS SOON LOCKED SO THAT THE HANDS OF THE BOATS WERE PASSING FROM VESSEL TO VESSEL AND THE WILDEST EXCITEMENT PREVAILED THROUGHOUT AMONGST BOTH PASSENGERS AND CREW
32-4137-0027 AT THIS MOMENT THE ENGINEER OF THE PATRIOT WAS SEEN TO FASTEN DOWN THE SAFETY VALVE SO THAT NO STEAM SHOULD ESCAPE THIS WAS INDEED A DANGEROUS RESORT
32-4137-0028 THE PATRIOT STOPPED TO TAKE IN PASSENGERS AND STILL NO STEAM WAS PERMITTED TO ESCAPE
32-4137-0029 AND AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED ONE OF THE BOILERS IMMEDIATELY EXPLODED ONE DENSE FOG OF STEAM FILLED EVERY PART OF THE VESSEL WHILE SHRIEKS GROANS AND CRIES WERE HEARD ON EVERY HAND THE SALOONS AND CABINS SOON HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A HOSPITAL
32-4137-0030 BY THIS TIME THE BOAT HAD LANDED AND THE COLUMBIA THE OTHER BOAT
32-4137-0031 THE KILLED AND SCALDED NINETEEN IN NUMBER
32-4137-0032 THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS CHANGE HANDS DURING A PASSAGE FROM LOUISVILLE OR SAINT LOUIS TO NEW ORLEANS ON A MISSISSIPPI STEAMER AND MANY MEN AND EVEN LADIES ARE COMPLETELY RUINED GO CALL MY BOY STEWARD
32-4137-0033 SAID MISTER SMITH AS HE TOOK HIS CARDS ONE BY ONE FROM THE TABLE IN A FEW MOMENTS A FINE LOOKING BRIGHT EYED MULATTO BOY APPARENTLY ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE WAS STANDING BY HIS MASTER'S SIDE AT THE TABLE
32-4137-0034 I WILL SEE YOU AND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS BETTER SAID SMITH AS HIS SERVANT JERRY APPROACHED THE TABLE
32-4137-0035 HE WILL BRING A THOUSAND DOLLARS ANY DAY IN THE NEW ORLEANS MARKET REPLIED SMITH THEN YOU BET THE WHOLE OF THE BOY DO YOU YES I CALL YOU THEN SAID JOHNSON AT THE SAME TIME SPREADING HIS CARDS OUT UPON THE TABLE
32-4137-0036 YOU HAVE BEAT ME SAID SMITH AS SOON AS HE SAW THE CARDS JERRY WHO WAS STANDING ON TOP OF THE TABLE WITH THE BANK NOTES AND SILVER DOLLARS ROUND HIS FEET WAS NOW ORDERED TO DESCEND FROM THE TABLE
32-4137-0037 YOU WILL NOT FORGET THAT YOU BELONG TO ME SAID JOHNSON AS THE YOUNG SLAVE WAS STEPPING FROM THE TABLE TO A CHAIR NO SIR REPLIED THE CHATTEL
32-4137-0038 YES SIR RESPONDED JERRY AS HE WIPED THE TEARS FROM HIS EYES SMITH TOOK FROM HIS POCKET THE BILL OF SALE AND HANDED IT TO JOHNSON AT THE SAME TIME SAYING
32-4137-0039 I CLAIM THE RIGHT OF REDEEMING THAT BOY MISTER JOHNSON MY FATHER GAVE HIM TO ME WHEN I CAME OF AGE AND I PROMISED NOT TO PART WITH HIM MOST CERTAINLY SIR THE BOY SHALL BE YOURS WHENEVER YOU HAND ME OVER A COOL THOUSAND REPLIED JOHNSON
32-4137-0040 THE NEXT MORNING AS THE PASSENGERS WERE ASSEMBLING IN THE BREAKFAST SALOONS AND UPON THE GUARDS OF THE VESSEL AND THE SERVANTS WERE SEEN RUNNING ABOUT WAITING UPON OR LOOKING FOR THEIR MASTERS POOR JERRY WAS ENTERING HIS NEW MASTER'S STATEROOM WITH HIS BOOTS
32-4137-0041 WHO DO YOU BELONG TO SAID A GENTLEMAN TO AN OLD BLACK MAN
32-4137-0042 WHEN I WENT TO SLEEP LAST NIGHT I BELONGED TO GOVERNOR LUCAS BUT I UNDERSTAND DAT HE IS BIN GAMBLING ALL NIGHT SO I DON'T KNOW WHO OWNS ME DIS MORNING SUCH IS THE UNCERTAINTY OF A SLAVE'S POSITION
32-4137-0043 HE GOES TO BED AT NIGHT THE PROPERTY OF THE MAN WITH WHOM HE HAS LIVED FOR YEARS AND GETS UP IN THE MORNING THE SLAVE OF SOME ONE WHOM HE HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE
32-4137-0044 TO BEHOLD FIVE OR SIX TABLES IN A STEAMBOAT'S CABIN WITH HALF A DOZEN MEN PLAYING AT CARDS AND MONEY PISTOLS BOWIE KNIVES ALL IN CONFUSION ON THE TABLES IS WHAT MAY BE SEEN AT ALMOST ANY TIME ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER ON THE FOURTH DAY WHILE AT NATCHEZ
32-4137-0045 TAKING IN FREIGHT AND PASSENGERS WALKER WHO HAD BEEN ON SHORE TO SEE SOME OF HIS OLD CUSTOMERS RETURNED ACCOMPANIED BY A TALL THIN FACED MAN DRESSED IN BLACK WITH A WHITE NECKCLOTH WHICH IMMEDIATELY PROCLAIMED HIM TO BE A CLERGYMAN
32-4137-0046 I WANT A GOOD TRUSTY WOMAN FOR HOUSE SERVICE SAID THE STRANGER AS THEY ENTERED THE CABIN WHERE WALKER'S SLAVES WERE KEPT HERE SHE IS AND NO MISTAKE REPLIED THE TRADER STAND UP CURRER MY GAL HERE'S A GENTLEMAN WHO WISHES TO SEE IF YOU WILL SUIT HIM
32-4137-0047 SHE IS A RARE COOK A GOOD WASHER AND WILL SUIT YOU TO A T I AM SURE IF YOU BUY ME I HOPE YOU WILL BUY MY DAUGHTER TOO SAID THE WOMAN IN RATHER AN EXCITED MANNER
32-4137-0048 I ONLY WANT ONE FOR MY OWN USE AND WOULD NOT NEED ANOTHER SAID THE MAN IN BLACK AS HE AND THE TRADER LEFT THE ROOM WALKER AND THE PARSON WENT INTO THE SALOON TALKED OVER THE MATTER THE BILL OF SALE WAS MADE OUT THE MONEY PAID OVER
32-4137-0049 AND THE CLERGYMAN LEFT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE WOMAN SHOULD BE DELIVERED TO HIM AT HIS HOUSE IT SEEMED AS IF POOR ALTHESA WOULD HAVE WEPT HERSELF TO DEATH FOR THE FIRST TWO DAYS AFTER HER MOTHER HAD BEEN TORN FROM HER SIDE BY THE HAND OF THE RUTHLESS TRAFFICKER IN HUMAN FLESH
32-4137-0050 ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE BOAT AT BATON ROUGE AN ADDITIONAL NUMBER OF PASSENGERS WERE TAKEN ON BOARD AND AMONGST THEM SEVERAL PERSONS WHO HAD BEEN ATTENDING THE RACES GAMBLING AND DRINKING WERE NOW THE ORDER OF THE DAY
32-4137-0051 WHICH CAUSED GREAT UNEASINESS TO THE LADIES AND TOOK THE GENTLEMEN TO THAT PART OF THE CABIN HOWEVER NOTHING SERIOUS HAD OCCURRED A MAN AT ONE OF THE TABLES WHERE THEY WERE GAMBLING HAD BEEN SEEN ATTEMPTING TO CONCEAL A CARD IN HIS SLEEVE
32-4137-0052 AND ONE OF THE PARTY SEIZED HIS PISTOL AND FIRED BUT FORTUNATELY THE BARREL OF THE PISTOL WAS KNOCKED UP JUST AS IT WAS ABOUT TO BE DISCHARGED AND THE BALL PASSED THROUGH THE UPPER DECK INSTEAD OF THE MAN'S HEAD AS INTENDED ORDER WAS SOON RESTORED
32-4137-0053 ALL WENT ON WELL THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT AND THE NEXT DAY AT TEN O'CLOCK THE BOAT ARRIVED AT NEW ORLEANS
32-4137-0054 OUR EYES ARE YET ON AFRIC'S SHORES HER THOUSAND WRONGS WE STILL DEPLORE WE SEE THE GRIM SLAVE TRADER THERE WE HEAR HIS FETTERED VICTIM'S PRAYER AND HASTEN TO THE SUFFERER'S AID
32-4137-0055 FORGETFUL OF OUR OWN SLAVE TRADE THE OCEAN PIRATE'S FIEND LIKE FORM SHALL SINK BENEATH THE VENGEANCE STORM HIS HEART OF STEEL SHALL QUAKE BEFORE THE BATTLE DIN AND HAVOC ROAR
32-4137-0056 THE KNAVE SHALL DIE THE LAW HATH SAID WHILE IT PROTECTS OUR OWN SLAVE TRADE WHAT EARTHLY EYE PRESUMES TO SCAN THE WILY PROTEUS HEART OF MAN WHAT POTENT HAND WILL E'ER UNROLL
32-4137-0057 THE MANTLED TREACHERY OF HIS SOUL O WHERE IS HE WHO HATH SURVEYED THE HORRORS OF OUR OWN SLAVE TRADE THERE IS AN EYE THAT WAKES IN LIGHT THERE IS A HAND OF PEERLESS MIGHT WHICH SOON OR LATE
32-4137-0058 SHALL YET ASSAIL AND REND DISSIMULATION'S VEIL
322-124146-0000 MISTER COLLINS WAS NOT LEFT LONG TO THE SILENT CONTEMPLATION OF HIS SUCCESSFUL LOVE FOR MISSUS BENNET HAVING DAWDLED ABOUT IN THE VESTIBULE TO WATCH FOR THE END OF THE CONFERENCE NO SOONER SAW ELIZABETH OPEN THE DOOR
322-124146-0001 THAN SHE ENTERED THE BREAKFAST ROOM AND CONGRATULATED BOTH HIM AND HERSELF
322-124146-0002 MISTER COLLINS RECEIVED AND RETURNED THESE FELICITATIONS WITH EQUAL PLEASURE AND THEN PROCEEDED TO RELATE THE PARTICULARS OF THEIR INTERVIEW WITH THE RESULT OF WHICH HE TRUSTED HE HAD EVERY REASON TO BE SATISFIED
322-124146-0003 SINCE THE REFUSAL WHICH HIS COUSIN HAD STEADFASTLY GIVEN HIM WOULD NATURALLY FLOW FROM HER BASHFUL MODESTY AND THE GENUINE DELICACY OF HER CHARACTER THIS INFORMATION HOWEVER STARTLED MISSUS BENNET
322-124146-0004 SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO BE EQUALLY SATISFIED THAT HER DAUGHTER HAD MEANT TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY PROTESTING AGAINST HIS PROPOSALS BUT SHE DARED NOT BELIEVE IT
322-124146-0005 SHE ADDED THAT LIZZY SHALL BE BROUGHT TO REASON
322-124146-0006 SHE IS A VERY HEADSTRONG FOOLISH GIRL AND DOES NOT KNOW HER OWN INTEREST BUT I WILL MAKE HER KNOW IT PARDON ME FOR INTERRUPTING YOU MADAM CRIED MISTER COLLINS
322-124146-0007 BUT IF SHE IS REALLY HEADSTRONG AND FOOLISH I KNOW NOT WHETHER SHE WOULD ALTOGETHER BE A VERY DESIRABLE WIFE TO A MAN IN MY SITUATION WHO NATURALLY LOOKS FOR HAPPINESS IN THE MARRIAGE STATE
322-124146-0008 IF THEREFORE SHE ACTUALLY PERSISTS IN REJECTING MY SUIT PERHAPS IT WERE BETTER NOT TO FORCE HER INTO ACCEPTING ME BECAUSE IF LIABLE TO SUCH DEFECTS OF TEMPER SHE COULD NOT CONTRIBUTE MUCH TO MY FELICITY
322-124146-0009 SIR YOU QUITE MISUNDERSTAND ME SAID MISSUS BENNET ALARMED LIZZY IS ONLY HEADSTRONG IN SUCH MATTERS AS THESE IN EVERYTHING ELSE SHE IS AS GOOD NATURED A GIRL AS EVER LIVED
322-124146-0010 HER MISTER BENNET RAISED HIS EYES FROM HIS BOOK AS SHE ENTERED AND FIXED THEM ON HER FACE WITH A CALM UNCONCERN WHICH WAS NOT IN THE LEAST ALTERED BY HER COMMUNICATION
322-124146-0011 I HAVE NOT THE PLEASURE OF UNDERSTANDING YOU SAID HE
322-124146-0012 YOUR MOTHER INSISTS UPON YOUR ACCEPTING IT IS IT NOT SO MISSUS BENNET YES OR I WILL NEVER SEE HER AGAIN AN UNHAPPY ALTERNATIVE IS BEFORE YOU ELIZABETH
322-124146-0013 FROM THIS DAY YOU MUST BE A STRANGER TO ONE OF YOUR PARENTS YOUR MOTHER WILL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN IF YOU DO NOT MARRY MISTER COLLINS AND I WILL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN IF YOU DO
322-124146-0014 MY DEAR REPLIED HER HUSBAND I HAVE TWO SMALL FAVOURS TO REQUEST FIRST THAT YOU WILL ALLOW ME THE FREE USE OF MY UNDERSTANDING ON THE PRESENT OCCASION AND SECONDLY
322-124146-0015 OF MY ROOM I SHALL BE GLAD TO HAVE THE LIBRARY TO MYSELF AS SOON AS MAY BE NOT YET HOWEVER IN SPITE OF HER DISAPPOINTMENT IN HER HUSBAND DID MISSUS BENNET GIVE UP THE POINT
322-124146-0016 SHE TALKED TO ELIZABETH AGAIN AND AGAIN COAXED AND THREATENED HER BY TURNS SHE ENDEAVOURED TO SECURE JANE IN HER INTEREST BUT JANE WITH ALL POSSIBLE MILDNESS DECLINED INTERFERING
322-124146-0017 AND ELIZABETH SOMETIMES WITH REAL EARNESTNESS AND SOMETIMES WITH PLAYFUL GAIETY REPLIED TO HER ATTACKS THOUGH HER MANNER VARIED HOWEVER HER DETERMINATION NEVER DID
322-124146-0018 MISTER COLLINS MEANWHILE WAS MEDITATING IN SOLITUDE ON WHAT HAD PASSED HE THOUGHT TOO WELL OF HIMSELF TO COMPREHEND ON WHAT MOTIVES HIS COUSIN COULD REFUSE HIM AND THOUGH HIS PRIDE WAS HURT
322-124146-0019 WHILE THE FAMILY WERE IN THIS CONFUSION CHARLOTTE LUCAS CAME TO SPEND THE DAY WITH THEM SHE WAS MET IN THE VESTIBULE BY LYDIA WHO FLYING TO HER CRIED IN A HALF WHISPER
322-124146-0020 I AM GLAD YOU ARE COME FOR THERE IS SUCH FUN HERE WHAT DO YOU THINK HAS HAPPENED THIS MORNING
322-124146-0021 WHO CAME TO TELL THE SAME NEWS AND NO SOONER HAD THEY ENTERED THE BREAKFAST ROOM WHERE MISSUS BENNET WAS ALONE THAN SHE LIKEWISE BEGAN ON THE SUBJECT CALLING ON MISS LUCAS FOR HER COMPASSION
322-124146-0022 SHE ADDED IN A MELANCHOLY TONE
322-124146-0023 I HAVE NO PLEASURE IN TALKING TO UNDUTIFUL CHILDREN
322-124146-0024 WHO SUFFER AS I DO FROM NERVOUS COMPLAINTS CAN HAVE NO GREAT INCLINATION FOR TALKING
322-124146-0025 BUT IT IS ALWAYS SO THOSE WHO DO NOT COMPLAIN ARE NEVER PITIED HER DAUGHTERS LISTENED IN SILENCE TO THIS EFFUSION
322-124146-0026 WOULD ONLY INCREASE THE IRRITATION SHE TALKED ON THEREFORE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION FROM ANY OF THEM TILL THEY WERE JOINED BY MISTER COLLINS
322-124146-0027 AND ON PERCEIVING WHOM SHE SAID TO THE GIRLS
322-124146-0028 ELIZABETH PASSED QUIETLY OUT OF THE ROOM JANE AND KITTY FOLLOWED BUT LYDIA STOOD HER GROUND DETERMINED TO HEAR ALL SHE COULD AND CHARLOTTE
322-124146-0029 DETAINED FIRST BY THE CIVILITY OF MISTER COLLINS WHOSE INQUIRIES AFTER HERSELF AND ALL HER FAMILY WERE VERY MINUTE AND THEN BY A LITTLE CURIOSITY SATISFIED HERSELF WITH WALKING TO THE WINDOW AND PRETENDING NOT TO HEAR
322-124146-0030 MY DEAR MADAM REPLIED HE LET US BE FOR EVER SILENT ON THIS POINT FAR BE IT FROM ME HE PRESENTLY CONTINUED
322-124146-0031 IN A VOICE THAT MARKED HIS DISPLEASURE TO RESENT THE BEHAVIOUR OF YOUR DAUGHTER RESIGNATION TO INEVITABLE EVILS IS THE DUTY OF US ALL THE PECULIAR DUTY OF A YOUNG MAN
322-124146-0032 WHO HAS BEEN SO FORTUNATE AS I HAVE BEEN IN EARLY PREFERMENT AND I TRUST I AM RESIGNED
322-124146-0033 HAD MY FAIR COUSIN HONOURED ME WITH HER HAND FOR I HAVE OFTEN OBSERVED THAT RESIGNATION IS NEVER SO PERFECT AS WHEN THE BLESSING DENIED BEGINS TO LOSE SOMEWHAT OF ITS VALUE IN OUR ESTIMATION
322-124146-0034 WITHOUT HAVING PAID YOURSELF AND MISTER BENNET THE COMPLIMENT OF REQUESTING YOU TO INTERPOSE YOUR AUTHORITY IN MY BEHALF
322-124146-0035 MY CONDUCT MAY I FEAR BE OBJECTIONABLE IN HAVING ACCEPTED MY DISMISSION FROM YOUR DAUGHTER'S LIPS INSTEAD OF YOUR OWN BUT WE ARE ALL LIABLE TO ERROR
322-124146-0036 I HAVE CERTAINLY MEANT WELL THROUGH THE WHOLE AFFAIR MY OBJECT HAS BEEN TO SECURE AN AMIABLE COMPANION FOR MYSELF
322-124146-0037 AND IF MY MANNER HAS BEEN AT ALL REPREHENSIBLE
322-124147-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE THE DISCUSSION OF MISTER COLLINS'S OFFER WAS NOW NEARLY AT AN END AND ELIZABETH HAD ONLY TO SUFFER FROM THE UNCOMFORTABLE FEELINGS NECESSARILY ATTENDING IT
322-124147-0001 AND OCCASIONALLY FROM SOME PEEVISH ALLUSIONS OF HER MOTHER AS FOR THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF HIS FEELINGS WERE CHIEFLY EXPRESSED NOT BY EMBARRASSMENT OR DEJECTION OR BY TRYING TO AVOID HER
322-124147-0002 BUT BY STIFFNESS OF MANNER AND RESENTFUL SILENCE HE SCARCELY EVER SPOKE TO HER AND THE ASSIDUOUS ATTENTIONS WHICH HE HAD BEEN SO SENSIBLE OF HIMSELF WERE TRANSFERRED FOR THE REST OF THE DAY TO MISS LUCAS
322-124147-0003 MISTER COLLINS WAS ALSO IN THE SAME STATE OF ANGRY PRIDE ELIZABETH HAD HOPED THAT HIS RESENTMENT MIGHT SHORTEN HIS VISIT BUT HIS PLAN DID NOT APPEAR IN THE LEAST AFFECTED BY IT HE WAS ALWAYS TO HAVE GONE ON SATURDAY
322-124147-0004 AFTER BREAKFAST THE GIRLS WALKED TO MERYTON TO INQUIRE IF MISTER WICKHAM WERE RETURNED AND TO LAMENT OVER HIS ABSENCE FROM THE NETHERFIELD BALL HE JOINED THEM ON THEIR ENTERING THE TOWN
322-124147-0005 AND ATTENDED THEM TO THEIR AUNT'S WHERE HIS REGRET AND VEXATION AND THE CONCERN OF EVERYBODY
322-124147-0006 TO ELIZABETH HOWEVER HE VOLUNTARILY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE NECESSITY OF HIS ABSENCE HAD BEEN SELF IMPOSED I FOUND SAID HE AS THE TIME DREW NEAR
322-124147-0007 THAT I HAD BETTER NOT MEET MISTER DARCY THAT TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM THE SAME PARTY WITH HIM FOR SO MANY HOURS TOGETHER MIGHT BE MORE THAN I COULD BEAR AND THAT SCENES MIGHT ARISE UNPLEASANT TO MORE THAN MYSELF
322-124147-0008 AND IT WAS MOST ACCEPTABLE AS AN OCCASION OF INTRODUCING HIM TO HER FATHER AND MOTHER SOON AFTER THEIR RETURN A LETTER WAS DELIVERED TO MISS BENNET
322-124147-0009 THE ENVELOPE CONTAINED A SHEET OF ELEGANT LITTLE HOT PRESSED PAPER WELL COVERED WITH A LADY'S FAIR FLOWING HAND AND ELIZABETH SAW HER SISTER'S COUNTENANCE CHANGE AS SHE READ IT
322-124147-0010 AND SAW HER DWELLING INTENTLY ON SOME PARTICULAR PASSAGES JANE RECOLLECTED HERSELF SOON AND PUTTING THE LETTER AWAY TRIED TO JOIN WITH HER USUAL CHEERFULNESS IN THE GENERAL CONVERSATION
322-124147-0011 BUT ELIZABETH FELT AN ANXIETY ON THE SUBJECT WHICH DREW OFF HER ATTENTION EVEN FROM WICKHAM AND NO SOONER HAD HE AND HIS COMPANION TAKEN LEAVE THAN A GLANCE FROM JANE INVITED HER TO FOLLOW HER UP STAIRS
322-124147-0012 IT IS UNLUCKY SAID SHE AFTER A SHORT PAUSE THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE YOUR FRIENDS BEFORE THEY LEAVE THE COUNTRY BUT MAY WE NOT HOPE THAT THE PERIOD OF FUTURE HAPPINESS
322-124147-0013 TO WHICH MISS BINGLEY LOOKS FORWARD MAY ARRIVE EARLIER THAN SHE IS AWARE AND THAT THE DELIGHTFUL INTERCOURSE YOU HAVE KNOWN AS FRIENDS WILL BE RENEWED WITH YET GREATER SATISFACTION AS SISTERS MISTER BINGLEY WILL NOT BE DETAINED IN LONDON BY THEM
322-124147-0014 CAROLINE DECIDEDLY SAYS THAT NONE OF THE PARTY WILL RETURN INTO HERTFORDSHIRE THIS WINTER I WILL READ IT TO YOU WHEN MY BROTHER LEFT US YESTERDAY
322-124147-0015 HE IMAGINED THAT THE BUSINESS WHICH TOOK HIM TO LONDON MIGHT BE CONCLUDED IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS BUT AS WE ARE CERTAIN IT CANNOT BE SO AND AT THE SAME TIME CONVINCED THAT WHEN CHARLES GETS TO TOWN HE WILL BE IN NO HURRY TO LEAVE IT AGAIN
322-124147-0016 AS TO PREVENT YOUR FEELING THE LOSS OF THE THREE OF WHOM WE SHALL DEPRIVE YOU IT IS EVIDENT BY THIS ADDED JANE THAT HE COMES BACK NO MORE THIS WINTER
322-124147-0017 WHY WILL YOU THINK SO IT MUST BE HIS OWN DOING HE IS HIS OWN MASTER BUT YOU DO NOT KNOW ALL I WILL READ YOU THE PASSAGE WHICH PARTICULARLY HURTS ME
322-124147-0018 I WILL HAVE NO RESERVES FROM YOU
322-124147-0019 AND TO CONFESS THE TRUTH WE ARE SCARCELY LESS EAGER TO MEET HER AGAIN I REALLY DO NOT THINK GEORGIANA DARCY HAS HER EQUAL FOR BEAUTY ELEGANCE AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND THE AFFECTION SHE INSPIRES IN LOUISA AND MYSELF
322-124147-0020 IS HEIGHTENED INTO SOMETHING STILL MORE INTERESTING
322-124147-0021 HE WILL HAVE FREQUENT OPPORTUNITY NOW OF SEEING HER ON THE MOST INTIMATE FOOTING HER RELATIONS ALL WISH THE CONNECTION AS MUCH AS HIS OWN AND A SISTER'S PARTIALITY IS NOT MISLEADING ME I THINK
322-124147-0022 WHEN I CALL CHARLES MOST CAPABLE OF ENGAGING ANY WOMAN'S HEART WITH ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TO FAVOUR AN ATTACHMENT AND NOTHING TO PREVENT IT AM I WRONG MY DEAREST JANE
322-124147-0023 IN INDULGING THE HOPE OF AN EVENT WHICH WILL SECURE THE HAPPINESS OF SO MANY
322-124147-0024 SAID JANE AS SHE FINISHED IT IS IT NOT CLEAR ENOUGH DOES IT NOT EXPRESSLY DECLARE THAT CAROLINE NEITHER EXPECTS NOR WISHES ME TO BE HER SISTER THAT SHE IS PERFECTLY CONVINCED OF HER BROTHER'S INDIFFERENCE
322-124147-0025 AND THAT IF SHE SUSPECTS THE NATURE OF MY FEELINGS FOR HIM SHE MEANS MOST KINDLY TO PUT ME ON MY GUARD CAN THERE BE ANY OTHER OPINION ON THE SUBJECT YES THERE CAN
322-124147-0026 FOR MINE IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT WILL YOU HEAR IT MOST WILLINGLY YOU SHALL HAVE IT IN A FEW WORDS MISS BINGLEY SEES THAT HER BROTHER IS IN LOVE WITH YOU AND WANTS HIM TO MARRY MISS DARCY
322-124147-0027 SHE FOLLOWS HIM TO TOWN IN HOPE OF KEEPING HIM THERE AND TRIES TO PERSUADE YOU THAT HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU JANE SHOOK HER HEAD INDEED JANE YOU OUGHT TO BELIEVE ME
322-124147-0028 NO ONE WHO HAS EVER SEEN YOU TOGETHER CAN DOUBT HIS AFFECTION MISS BINGLEY I AM SURE CANNOT SHE IS NOT SUCH A SIMPLETON COULD SHE HAVE SEEN HALF AS MUCH LOVE IN MISTER DARCY FOR HERSELF
322-124147-0029 BUT THE CASE IS THIS WE ARE NOT RICH ENOUGH OR GRAND ENOUGH FOR THEM AND SHE IS THE MORE ANXIOUS TO GET MISS DARCY FOR HER BROTHER FROM THE NOTION THAT WHEN THERE HAS BEEN ONE INTERMARRIAGE SHE MAY HAVE LESS TROUBLE IN ACHIEVING A SECOND
322-124147-0030 IN WHICH THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME INGENUITY AND I DARE SAY IT WOULD SUCCEED IF MISS DE BOURGH WERE OUT OF THE WAY BUT MY DEAREST JANE YOU CANNOT SERIOUSLY IMAGINE
322-124147-0031 THAT BECAUSE MISS BINGLEY TELLS YOU HER BROTHER GREATLY ADMIRES MISS DARCY HE IS IN THE SMALLEST DEGREE LESS SENSIBLE OF YOUR MERIT THAN WHEN HE TOOK LEAVE OF YOU ON TUESDAY OR THAT IT WILL BE IN HER POWER TO PERSUADE HIM THAT INSTEAD OF BEING IN LOVE WITH YOU
322-124147-0032 CAROLINE IS INCAPABLE OF WILFULLY DECEIVING ANYONE
322-124147-0033 IS THAT SHE IS DECEIVING HERSELF THAT IS RIGHT YOU COULD NOT HAVE STARTED A MORE HAPPY IDEA SINCE YOU WILL NOT TAKE COMFORT IN MINE BELIEVE HER TO BE DECEIVED BY ALL MEANS
322-124147-0034 EVEN SUPPOSING THE BEST IN ACCEPTING A MAN WHOSE SISTERS AND FRIENDS ARE ALL WISHING HIM TO MARRY ELSEWHERE YOU MUST DECIDE FOR YOURSELF SAID ELIZABETH
322-124147-0035 AND IF UPON MATURE DELIBERATION YOU FIND THAT THE MISERY OF DISOBLIGING HIS TWO SISTERS IS MORE THAN EQUIVALENT TO THE HAPPINESS OF BEING HIS WIFE I ADVISE YOU BY ALL MEANS TO REFUSE HIM
322-124147-0036 THE IDEA OF HIS RETURNING NO MORE ELIZABETH TREATED WITH THE UTMOST CONTEMPT IT APPEARED TO HER MERELY THE SUGGESTION OF CAROLINE'S INTERESTED WISHES AND SHE COULD NOT FOR A MOMENT SUPPOSE THAT THOSE WISHES
322-124147-0037 HOWEVER OPENLY OR ARTFULLY SPOKEN COULD INFLUENCE A YOUNG MAN SO TOTALLY INDEPENDENT OF EVERYONE SHE REPRESENTED TO HER SISTER AS FORCIBLY AS POSSIBLE WHAT SHE FELT ON THE SUBJECT
322-124147-0038 AND HAD SOON THE PLEASURE OF SEEING ITS HAPPY EFFECT JANE'S TEMPER WAS NOT DESPONDING AND SHE WAS GRADUALLY LED TO HOPE THOUGH THE DIFFIDENCE OF AFFECTION SOMETIMES OVERCAME THE HOPE THAT BINGLEY WOULD RETURN TO NETHERFIELD
322-124147-0039 AND ANSWER EVERY WISH OF HER HEART THEY AGREED THAT MISSUS BENNET SHOULD ONLY HEAR OF THE DEPARTURE OF THE FAMILY WITHOUT BEING ALARMED ON THE SCORE OF THE GENTLEMAN'S CONDUCT BUT EVEN THIS PARTIAL COMMUNICATION GAVE HER A GREAT DEAL OF CONCERN
322-124147-0040 AND SHE BEWAILED IT AS EXCEEDINGLY UNLUCKY THAT THE LADIES SHOULD HAPPEN TO GO AWAY JUST AS THEY WERE ALL GETTING SO INTIMATE TOGETHER AFTER LAMENTING IT HOWEVER AT SOME LENGTH
322-124147-0041 AND SOON DINING AT LONGBOURN AND THE CONCLUSION OF ALL WAS THE COMFORTABLE DECLARATION THAT THOUGH HE HAD BEEN INVITED ONLY TO A FAMILY DINNER SHE WOULD TAKE CARE TO HAVE TWO FULL COURSES
322-124147-0042 THE BENNETS WERE ENGAGED TO DINE WITH THE LUCASES AND AGAIN DURING THE CHIEF OF THE DAY WAS MISS LUCAS SO KIND AS TO LISTEN TO MISTER COLLINS ELIZABETH TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF THANKING HER
322-124147-0043 IT KEEPS HIM IN GOOD HUMOUR SAID SHE AND I AM MORE OBLIGED TO YOU THAN I CAN EXPRESS CHARLOTTE ASSURED HER FRIEND OF HER SATISFACTION IN BEING USEFUL
322-124147-0044 AND THAT IT AMPLY REPAID HER FOR THE LITTLE SACRIFICE OF HER TIME THIS WAS VERY AMIABLE BUT CHARLOTTE'S KINDNESS EXTENDED FARTHER THAN ELIZABETH HAD ANY CONCEPTION OF
322-124147-0045 BY ENGAGING THEM TOWARDS HERSELF SUCH WAS MISS LUCAS'S SCHEME AND APPEARANCES WERE SO FAVOURABLE THAT WHEN THEY PARTED AT NIGHT
322-124147-0046 BUT HERE SHE DID INJUSTICE TO THE FIRE AND INDEPENDENCE OF HIS CHARACTER FOR IT LED HIM TO ESCAPE OUT OF LONGBOURN HOUSE THE NEXT MORNING WITH ADMIRABLE SLYNESS AND HASTEN TO LUCAS LODGE TO THROW HIMSELF AT HER FEET
322-124147-0047 HE WAS ANXIOUS TO AVOID THE NOTICE OF HIS COUSINS FROM A CONVICTION THAT IF THEY SAW HIM DEPART THEY COULD NOT FAIL TO CONJECTURE HIS DESIGN
322-124147-0048 FOR THOUGH FEELING ALMOST SECURE AND WITH REASON FOR CHARLOTTE HAD BEEN TOLERABLY ENCOURAGING HE WAS COMPARATIVELY DIFFIDENT SINCE THE ADVENTURE OF WEDNESDAY HIS RECEPTION HOWEVER WAS OF THE MOST FLATTERING KIND
322-124147-0049 MISS LUCAS PERCEIVED HIM FROM AN UPPER WINDOW AS HE WALKED TOWARDS THE HOUSE AND INSTANTLY SET OUT TO MEET HIM ACCIDENTALLY IN THE LANE BUT LITTLE HAD SHE DARED TO HOPE THAT SO MUCH LOVE AND ELOQUENCE AWAITED HER THERE
322-124147-0050 IN AS SHORT A TIME AS MISTER COLLINS'S LONG SPEECHES WOULD ALLOW EVERYTHING WAS SETTLED BETWEEN THEM TO THE SATISFACTION OF BOTH AND AS THEY ENTERED THE HOUSE
322-124147-0051 THE STUPIDITY WITH WHICH HE WAS FAVOURED BY NATURE MUST GUARD HIS COURTSHIP FROM ANY CHARM THAT COULD MAKE A WOMAN WISH FOR ITS CONTINUANCE AND MISS LUCAS
322-124147-0052 WHO ACCEPTED HIM SOLELY FROM THE PURE AND DISINTERESTED DESIRE OF AN ESTABLISHMENT CARED NOT HOW SOON THAT ESTABLISHMENT WERE GAINED SIR WILLIAM AND LADY LUCAS WERE SPEEDILY APPLIED TO FOR THEIR CONSENT
322-124147-0053 AND HIS PROSPECTS OF FUTURE WEALTH WERE EXCEEDINGLY FAIR LADY LUCAS BEGAN DIRECTLY TO CALCULATE WITH MORE INTEREST THAN THE MATTER HAD EVER EXCITED BEFORE HOW MANY YEARS LONGER MISTER BENNET WAS LIKELY TO LIVE
322-124147-0054 AND SIR WILLIAM GAVE IT AS HIS DECIDED OPINION THAT WHENEVER MISTER COLLINS SHOULD BE IN POSSESSION OF THE LONGBOURN ESTATE IT WOULD BE HIGHLY EXPEDIENT THAT BOTH HE AND HIS WIFE SHOULD MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE AT SAINT JAMES'S
322-124147-0055 THE WHOLE FAMILY IN SHORT WERE PROPERLY OVERJOYED ON THE OCCASION THE YOUNGER GIRLS FORMED HOPES OF COMING OUT A YEAR OR TWO SOONER THAN THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE DONE
322-124147-0056 AND THE BOYS WERE RELIEVED FROM THEIR APPREHENSION OF CHARLOTTE'S DYING AN OLD MAID CHARLOTTE HERSELF WAS TOLERABLY COMPOSED SHE HAD GAINED HER POINT AND HAD TIME TO CONSIDER OF IT
322-124147-0057 HER REFLECTIONS WERE IN GENERAL SATISFACTORY MISTER COLLINS TO BE SURE WAS NEITHER SENSIBLE NOR AGREEABLE HIS SOCIETY WAS IRKSOME AND HIS ATTACHMENT TO HER MUST BE IMAGINARY
322-124147-0058 BUT STILL HE WOULD BE HER HUSBAND WITHOUT THINKING HIGHLY EITHER OF MEN OR MATRIMONY MARRIAGE HAD ALWAYS BEEN HER OBJECT
322-124147-0059 AND HOWEVER UNCERTAIN OF GIVING HAPPINESS MUST BE THEIR PLEASANTEST PRESERVATIVE FROM WANT THIS PRESERVATIVE SHE HAD NOW OBTAINED AND AT THE AGE OF TWENTY SEVEN
322-124147-0060 WITHOUT HAVING EVER BEEN HANDSOME SHE FELT ALL THE GOOD LUCK OF IT THE LEAST AGREEABLE CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE BUSINESS WAS THE SURPRISE IT MUST OCCASION TO ELIZABETH BENNET
322-124147-0061 WHOSE FRIENDSHIP SHE VALUED BEYOND THAT OF ANY OTHER PERSON ELIZABETH WOULD WONDER AND PROBABLY WOULD BLAME HER AND THOUGH HER RESOLUTION WAS NOT TO BE SHAKEN HER FEELINGS MUST BE HURT
322-124147-0062 SHE RESOLVED TO GIVE HER THE INFORMATION HERSELF AND THEREFORE CHARGED MISTER COLLINS WHEN HE RETURNED TO LONGBOURN TO DINNER TO DROP NO HINT OF WHAT HAD PASSED BEFORE ANY OF THE FAMILY
322-124147-0063 FOR THE CURIOSITY EXCITED BY HIS LONG ABSENCE BURST FORTH IN SUCH VERY DIRECT QUESTIONS ON HIS RETURN AS REQUIRED SOME INGENUITY TO EVADE AND HE WAS AT THE SAME TIME EXERCISING GREAT SELF DENIAL
322-124147-0064 FOR HE WAS LONGING TO PUBLISH HIS PROSPEROUS LOVE AS HE WAS TO BEGIN HIS JOURNEY TOO EARLY ON THE MORROW TO SEE ANY OF THE FAMILY THE CEREMONY OF LEAVE TAKING WAS PERFORMED WHEN THE LADIES MOVED FOR THE NIGHT
322-124147-0065 AND MISSUS BENNET WITH GREAT POLITENESS AND CORDIALITY SAID HOW HAPPY THEY SHOULD BE TO SEE HIM AT LONGBOURN AGAIN
322-124147-0066 MY DEAR MADAM HE REPLIED THIS INVITATION IS PARTICULARLY GRATIFYING BECAUSE IT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN HOPING TO RECEIVE
322-124147-0067 AND YOU MAY BE VERY CERTAIN THAT I SHALL AVAIL MYSELF OF IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THEY WERE ALL ASTONISHED AND MISTER BENNET WHO COULD BY NO MEANS WISH FOR SO SPEEDY A RETURN
322-124147-0068 IMMEDIATELY SAID BUT IS THERE NOT DANGER OF LADY CATHERINE'S DISAPPROBATION HERE MY GOOD SIR YOU HAD BETTER NEGLECT YOUR RELATIONS THAN RUN THE RISK OF OFFENDING YOUR PATRONESS MY DEAR SIR
322-124147-0069 YOU CANNOT BE TOO MUCH UPON YOUR GUARD RISK ANYTHING RATHER THAN HER DISPLEASURE AND IF YOU FIND IT LIKELY TO BE RAISED BY YOUR COMING TO US AGAIN WHICH I SHOULD THINK EXCEEDINGLY PROBABLE
322-124147-0070 STAY QUIETLY AT HOME AND BE SATISFIED THAT WE SHALL TAKE NO OFFENCE BELIEVE ME MY DEAR SIR MY GRATITUDE IS WARMLY EXCITED BY SUCH AFFECTIONATE ATTENTION
322-124147-0071 AS FOR MY FAIR COUSINS THOUGH MY ABSENCE MAY NOT BE LONG ENOUGH TO RENDER IT NECESSARY
322-124147-0072 NOT EXCEPTING MY COUSIN ELIZABETH WITH PROPER CIVILITIES THE LADIES THEN WITHDREW
322-124147-0073 THERE WAS A SOLIDITY IN HIS REFLECTIONS WHICH OFTEN STRUCK HER AND THOUGH BY NO MEANS SO CLEVER AS HERSELF SHE THOUGHT THAT IF ENCOURAGED TO READ AND IMPROVE HIMSELF BY SUCH AN EXAMPLE AS HERS
322-124147-0074 RELATED THE EVENT OF THE DAY BEFORE THE POSSIBILITY OF MISTER COLLINS'S FANCYING HIMSELF IN LOVE WITH HER FRIEND HAD ONCE OCCURRED TO ELIZABETH WITHIN THE LAST DAY OR TWO BUT THAT CHARLOTTE COULD ENCOURAGE HIM
322-124147-0075 SEEMED ALMOST AS FAR FROM POSSIBILITY
322-124147-0076 AND HER ASTONISHMENT WAS CONSEQUENTLY SO GREAT AS TO OVERCOME AT FIRST THE BOUNDS OF DECORUM AND SHE COULD NOT HELP CRYING OUT ENGAGED TO MISTER COLLINS
322-124147-0077 THE STEADY COUNTENANCE WHICH MISS LUCAS HAD COMMANDED IN TELLING HER STORY GAVE WAY TO A MOMENTARY CONFUSION HERE ON RECEIVING SO DIRECT A REPROACH THOUGH AS IT WAS NO MORE THAN SHE EXPECTED
322-124147-0078 SHE SOON REGAINED HER COMPOSURE AND CALMLY REPLIED WHY SHOULD YOU BE SURPRISED MY DEAR ELIZA
322-124147-0079 AND THAT SHE WISHED HER ALL IMAGINABLE HAPPINESS I SEE WHAT YOU ARE FEELING REPLIED CHARLOTTE YOU MUST BE SURPRISED VERY MUCH SURPRISED SO LATELY AS MISTER COLLINS WAS WISHING TO MARRY YOU
322-124147-0080 I HOPE YOU WILL BE SATISFIED WITH WHAT I HAVE DONE I AM NOT ROMANTIC YOU KNOW I NEVER WAS I ASK ONLY A COMFORTABLE HOME AND CONSIDERING MISTER COLLINS'S CHARACTER
322-124147-0081 I AM CONVINCED THAT MY CHANCE OF HAPPINESS WITH HIM IS AS FAIR AS MOST PEOPLE CAN BOAST ON ENTERING THE MARRIAGE STATE ELIZABETH QUIETLY ANSWERED UNDOUBTEDLY AND AFTER AN AWKWARD PAUSE
322-124147-0082 THE STRANGENESS OF MISTER COLLINS'S MAKING TWO OFFERS OF MARRIAGE WITHIN THREE DAYS WAS NOTHING IN COMPARISON OF HIS BEING NOW ACCEPTED SHE HAD ALWAYS FELT THAT CHARLOTTE'S OPINION OF MATRIMONY WAS NOT EXACTLY LIKE HER OWN
322-124147-0083 THAT WHEN CALLED INTO ACTION SHE WOULD HAVE SACRIFICED EVERY BETTER FEELING TO WORLDLY ADVANTAGE CHARLOTTE THE WIFE OF MISTER COLLINS WAS A MOST HUMILIATING PICTURE
3240-131231-0000 ATTEMPTS TO PRESERVE THE SYSTEM THAT SMALL FROGS AND TOADS FOR INSTANCE NEVER HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY BUT WERE ON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE OR THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SUCH FALLS UP FROM ONE PLACE IN A WHIRLWIND AND DOWN IN ANOTHER
3240-131231-0001 WERE THERE SOME ESPECIALLY FROGGY PLACE NEAR EUROPE AS THERE IS AN ESPECIALLY SANDY PLACE THE SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION WOULD OF COURSE BE THAT ALL SMALL FROGS FALLING FROM THE SKY IN EUROPE COME FROM THAT CENTER OF FROGEITY TO START WITH
3240-131231-0002 I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE SOMETHING THAT I AM PERMITTED TO SEE BECAUSE I AM STILL PRIMITIVE OR INTELLIGENT OR IN A STATE OF MALADJUSTMENT
3240-131231-0003 OF A FALL OF TADPOLES FROM THE SKY AS TO THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
3240-131231-0004 THE WRITER SAYS THAT ALL OBSERVERS WERE MISTAKEN THAT THE FROGS OR TOADS MUST HAVE FALLEN FROM TREES OR OTHER PLACES OVERHEAD TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF LITTLE TOADS ONE OR TWO MONTHS OLD
3240-131231-0005 THAT WERE SEEN TO FALL FROM A GREAT THICK CLOUD THAT APPEARED SUDDENLY IN A SKY THAT HAD BEEN CLOUDLESS AUGUST EIGHTEEN O FOUR NEAR TOULOUSE FRANCE ACCORDING TO A LETTER FROM PROFESSOR PONTUS TO M ARAGO
3240-131231-0006 MANY INSTANCES OF FROGS THAT WERE SEEN TO FALL FROM THE SKY
3240-131231-0007 AS TO HAVING BEEN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
3240-131231-0008 JULY THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT
3240-131231-0009 LITTLE TOADS FOUND IN A DESERT AFTER A RAINFALL NOTES AND QUERIES
3240-131231-0010 TO START WITH I DO NOT DENY POSITIVELY THE CONVENTIONAL EXPLANATION OF UP AND DOWN I THINK THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SUCH OCCURRENCES I OMIT MANY NOTES THAT I HAVE UPON INDISTINGUISHABLES
3240-131231-0011 IN THE LONDON TIMES JULY FOURTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE THERE IS AN ACCOUNT OF A SHOWER OF TWIGS AND LEAVES AND TINY TOADS IN A STORM UPON THE SLOPES OF THE APENNINES THESE MAY HAVE BEEN THE EJECTAMENTA OF A WHIRLWIND I ADD HOWEVER
3240-131231-0012 THAT I HAVE NOTES UPON TWO OTHER FALLS OF TINY TOADS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE ONE IN FRANCE AND ONE IN TAHITI ALSO OF FISH IN SCOTLAND BUT IN THE PHENOMENON OF THE APENNINES THE MIXTURE SEEMS TO ME TO BE TYPICAL OF THE PRODUCTS OF A WHIRLWIND
3240-131231-0013 THE OTHER INSTANCES SEEM TO ME TO BE TYPICAL OF SOMETHING LIKE MIGRATION THEIR GREAT NUMBERS AND THEIR HOMOGENEITY OVER AND OVER IN THESE ANNALS OF THE DAMNED OCCURS THE DATUM OF SEGREGATION
3240-131231-0014 BUT A WHIRLWIND IS THOUGHT OF AS A CONDITION OF CHAOS QUASI CHAOS
3240-131231-0015 MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW JULY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE A SMALL POND IN THE TRACK OF THE CLOUD WAS SUCKED DRY THE WATER BEING CARRIED OVER THE ADJOINING FIELDS TOGETHER WITH A LARGE QUANTITY OF SOFT MUD WHICH WAS SCATTERED OVER THE GROUND FOR HALF A MILE AROUND
3240-131231-0016 BUT HERE ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF A SCOOP IN THE EXCLUSIONIST IMAGINATION THERE IS NO REGARD FOR MUD DEBRIS FROM THE BOTTOM OF A POND FLOATING VEGETATION LOOSE THINGS FROM THE SHORES BUT A PRECISE PICKING OUT OF FROGS ONLY
3240-131231-0017 OF ALL INSTANCES I HAVE THAT ATTRIBUTE THE FALL OF SMALL FROGS OR TOADS TO WHIRLWINDS ONLY ONE DEFINITELY IDENTIFIES OR PLACES THE WHIRLWIND ALSO AS HAS BEEN SAID BEFORE A POND GOING UP WOULD BE QUITE AS INTERESTING AS FROGS COMING DOWN
3240-131231-0018 WHIRLWINDS WE READ OF OVER AND OVER BUT WHERE AND WHAT WHIRLWIND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ANYBODY WHO HAD LOST A POND WOULD BE HEARD FROM IN SYMONS METEOROLOGICAL MAGAZINE
3240-131231-0019 A FALL OF SMALL FROGS NEAR BIRMINGHAM ENGLAND JUNE THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO IS ATTRIBUTED TO A SPECIFIC WHIRLWIND BUT NOT A WORD AS TO ANY SPECIAL POND THAT HAD CONTRIBUTED
3240-131231-0020 AND SOMETHING THAT STRIKES MY ATTENTION HERE IS THAT THESE FROGS ARE DESCRIBED AS ALMOST WHITE I'M AFRAID THERE IS NO ESCAPE FOR US WE SHALL HAVE TO GIVE TO CIVILIZATION UPON THIS EARTH SOME NEW WORLDS PLACES WITH WHITE FROGS IN THEM
3240-131231-0021 IN SPITE OF ALL WE THINK WE KNOW OF THE ACCELERATIVE VELOCITY OF FALLING BODIES AND HAVE PROPAGATED WHY THE EXOTIC BECOMES THE INDIGENOUS OR FROM THE STRANGEST OF PLACES WE'D EXPECT THE FAMILIAR OR
3240-131231-0022 IF HOSTS OF LIVING FROGS HAVE COME HERE FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE EVERY LIVING THING UPON THIS EARTH MAY ANCESTRALLY HAVE COME FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE I FIND THAT I HAVE ANOTHER NOTE UPON A SPECIFIC HURRICANE
3240-131231-0023 AFTER ONE OF THE GREATEST HURRICANES IN THE HISTORY OF IRELAND SOME FISH WERE FOUND AS FAR AS FIFTEEN YARDS FROM THE EDGE OF A LAKE HAVE ANOTHER THIS IS A GOOD ONE FOR THE EXCLUSIONISTS FALL OF FISH IN PARIS SAID THAT A NEIGHBORING POND HAD BEEN BLOWN DRY
3240-131231-0024 DATE NOT GIVEN BUT I HAVE SEEN IT RECORDED SOMEWHERE ELSE THE BEST KNOWN FALL OF FISHES FROM THE SKY IS THAT WHICH OCCURRED AT MOUNTAIN ASH
3240-131231-0025 FEBRUARY ELEVENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE THE EDITOR OF THE ZOOLOGIST
3240-131231-0026 HAVING PUBLISHED A REPORT OF A FALL OF FISHES WRITES I AM CONTINUALLY RECEIVING SIMILAR ACCOUNTS OF FROGS AND FISHES BUT IN ALL THE VOLUMES OF THE ZOOLOGIST I CAN FIND ONLY TWO REPORTS OF SUCH FALLS THERE IS NOTHING TO CONCLUDE
3240-131231-0027 OTHER THAN THAT HOSTS OF DATA HAVE BEEN LOST BECAUSE ORTHODOXY DOES NOT LOOK FAVORABLY UPON SUCH REPORTS THE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW RECORDS SEVERAL FALLS OF FISHES IN THE UNITED STATES
3240-131231-0028 NEVERTHELESS THE TREATMENT BY THE ZOOLOGIST OF THE FALL REPORTED FROM MOUNTAIN ASH IS FAIR FIRST APPEARS
3240-131231-0029 VICAR OF ABEDARE ASSERTING THAT THE FALL HAD OCCURRED CHIEFLY UPON THE PROPERTY OF MISTER NIXON OF MOUNTAIN ASH
3240-131231-0030 OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM BRISTLING WITH EXCLUSIONISM WRITES THAT SOME OF THESE FISHES WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM ALIVE WERE VERY YOUNG MINNOWS HE SAYS ON READING THE EVIDENCE IT SEEMS TO ME MOST PROBABLY ONLY A PRACTICAL JOKE
3240-131231-0031 THE EDITOR SAYS THAT ONE WAS A MINNOW AND THAT THE REST WERE STICKLEBACKS HE SAYS THAT DOCTOR GRAY'S EXPLANATION IS NO DOUBT RIGHT BUT
3240-131231-0032 HE PUBLISHES A LETTER FROM ANOTHER CORRESPONDENT WHO APOLOGIZES FOR OPPOSING SO HIGH AN AUTHORITY AS DOCTOR GRAY BUT SAYS THAT HE HAD OBTAINED SOME OF THESE FISHES FROM PERSONS WHO LIVED AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE APART
3240-131231-0033 OR CONSIDERABLY OUT OF RANGE OF THE PLAYFUL PAIL OF WATER ACCORDING TO THE ANNUAL REGISTER
3240-131231-0034 THE FISHES THEMSELVES HAD FALLEN BY PAILFULS IF THESE FISHES WERE NOT UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE WE BASE OUR OBJECTIONS TO THE WHIRLWIND EXPLANATION UPON TWO DATA THAT THEY FELL IN NO SUCH DISTRIBUTION AS ONE COULD ATTRIBUTE TO THE DISCHARGE OF A WHIRLWIND
3240-131231-0035 THAT TEN MINUTES LATER ANOTHER FALL OF FISHES OCCURRED UPON THIS SAME NARROW STRIP OF LAND EVEN ARGUING THAT A WHIRLWIND MAY STAND STILL AXIALLY IT DISCHARGES TANGENTIALLY WHEREVER THE FISHES CAME FROM IT DOES NOT SEEM THINKABLE
3240-131231-0036 THAT SOME COULD HAVE FALLEN AND THAT OTHERS COULD HAVE WHIRLED EVEN A TENTH OF A MINUTE THEN FALLING DIRECTLY AFTER THE FIRST TO FALL BECAUSE OF THESE EVIL CIRCUMSTANCES THE BEST ADAPTATION WAS TO LAUGH THE WHOLE THING OFF
3240-131231-0037 VERY YOUNG MINNOWS HAD BEEN CAUGHT UP IN THE LONDON TIMES MARCH SECOND EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE IS A LETTER FROM MISTER AARON ROBERTS CURATE OF SAINT PETER'S CARMATHON IN THIS LETTER
3240-131231-0038 BUT THERE IS SOME QUESTION OF SPECIES I THINK MYSELF THAT THEY WERE MINNOWS AND STICKLEBACKS SOME PERSONS THINKING THEM TO BE SEA FISHES PLACED THEM IN SALT WATER ACCORDING TO MISTER ROBERTS
3240-131231-0039 SOME WERE PLACED IN FRESH WATER THESE SEEMED TO THRIVE WELL AS TO NARROW DISTRIBUTION WE ARE TOLD THAT THE FISHES FELL IN AND ABOUT THE PREMISES OF MISTER NIXON IT WAS NOT OBSERVED AT THE TIME THAT ANY FISH FELL IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
3240-131231-0040 SAVE IN THE PARTICULAR SPOT MENTIONED IN THE LONDON TIMES MARCH TENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE VICAR GRIFFITH WRITES AN ACCOUNT THE ROOFS OF SOME HOUSES WERE COVERED WITH THEM
3240-131231-0041 IN THIS LETTER IT IS SAID THAT THE LARGEST FISHES WERE FIVE INCHES LONG AND THAT THESE DID NOT SURVIVE THE FALL REPORT OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION
3240-131231-0042 THE EVIDENCE OF THE FALL OF FISH ON THIS OCCASION WAS VERY CONCLUSIVE A SPECIMEN OF THE FISH WAS EXHIBITED
3240-131231-0043 LEIRUS GASTEROSTEUS IS THE STICKLEBACK ALTOGETHER I THINK WE HAVE NOT A SENSE OF TOTAL PERDITION
3240-131231-0044 IN WHICH WERE THOUSANDS OF FISHES FOUR OR FIVE INCHES LONG SOME OF WHICH COVERED ROOFS OF HOUSES AND SOME OF WHICH REMAINED TEN MINUTES IN THE AIR BY WAY OF CONTRAST WE OFFER OUR OWN ACCEPTANCE THAT THE BOTTOM OF A SUPER GEOGRAPHICAL POND HAD DROPPED OUT
3240-131231-0045 I HAVE A GREAT MANY NOTES UPON THE FALL OF FISHES DESPITE THE DIFFICULTY THESE RECORDS HAVE IN GETTING THEMSELVES PUBLISHED BUT I PICK OUT THE INSTANCES THAT ESPECIALLY RELATE TO OUR SUPER GEOGRAPHICAL ACCEPTANCES
3240-131231-0046 THAT HAVE FALLEN WITH A DISTRIBUTION NARROWER THAN IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A WHIRLWIND THAT HAVE FALLEN FOR A CONSIDERABLE LENGTH OF TIME UPON THE SAME NARROW AREA OF LAND THESE THREE FACTORS INDICATE SOMEWHERE NOT FAR ALOFT
3240-131231-0047 A REGION OF INERTNESS TO THIS EARTH'S GRAVITATION OF COURSE HOWEVER A REGION THAT BY THE FLUX AND VARIATION OF ALL THINGS MUST AT TIMES BE SUSCEPTIBLE BUT AFTERWARD OUR HERESY WILL BIFURCATE
3240-131231-0048 IN AMIABLE ACCOMMODATION TO THE CRUCIFIXION IT'LL GET I THINK BUT SO IMPRESSED ARE WE WITH THE DATUM THAT THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN MANY REPORTS OF SMALL FROGS THAT HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY
3240-131231-0049 THAT TO THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ANOTHER ADJUSTMENT MUST BE MADE APART FROM OUR THREE FACTORS OF INDICATION AN EXTRAORDINARY OBSERVATION IS THE FALL OF LIVING THINGS WITHOUT INJURY TO THEM
3240-131231-0050 SOMETHING ELSE APART FROM OUR THREE MAIN INTERESTS IS A PHENOMENON THAT LOOKS LIKE WHAT ONE MIGHT CALL AN ALTERNATING SERIES OF FALLS OF FISHES WHATEVER THE SIGNIFICANCE MAY BE
3240-131231-0051 JULY EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR LIVING AGE
3240-131231-0052 FIFESHIRE SCOTLAND SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR
3240-131231-0053 MORADABAD INDIA JULY EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX LIVING AGE
3240-131231-0054 ROSS SHIRE SCOTLAND EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT
3240-131231-0055 MORADABAD INDIA JULY TWENTIETH EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE
3240-131231-0056 FERIDPOOR INDIA FEBRUARY NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY
3240-131231-0057 DISREGARDING SERIAL SIGNIFICANCE OR MECHANICAL UNINTELLIGENT REPULSIVE REFLEX IS THAT THE FISHES OF INDIA DID NOT FALL FROM THE SKY THAT THEY WERE FOUND UPON THE GROUND AFTER TORRENTIAL RAINS BECAUSE STREAMS HAD OVERFLOWED AND HAD THEN RECEDED
3240-131231-0058 IN THE REGION OF INERTNESS THAT WE THINK WE CAN CONCEIVE OF OR A ZONE THAT IS TO THIS EARTH'S GRAVITATION VERY MUCH LIKE THE NEUTRAL ZONE OF A MAGNET'S ATTRACTION WE ACCEPT THAT THERE ARE BODIES OF WATER AND ALSO CLEAR SPACES BOTTOMS OF PONDS DROPPING OUT
3240-131231-0059 REMAIN AND DRY OR EVEN PUTREFY THEN SOMETIMES FALLING BY ATMOSPHERIC DISLODGMENT AFTER A TREMENDOUS DELUGE OF RAIN ONE OF THE HEAVIEST FALLS ON RECORD
3240-131231-0060 JULY TWENTY FIFTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY
3240-131231-0061 THE WORD FOUND IS AGREEABLE TO THE REPULSIONS OF THE CONVENTIONALISTS AND THEIR CONCEPT OF AN OVERFLOWING STREAM BUT ACCORDING TO DOCTOR BUIST SOME OF THESE FISHES WERE FOUND ON THE TOPS OF HAYSTACKS FERREL
3240-131231-0062 TELLS OF A FALL OF LIVING FISHES SOME OF THEM HAVING BEEN PLACED IN A TANK WHERE THEY SURVIVED THAT OCCURRED IN INDIA ABOUT TWENTY MILES SOUTH OF CALCUTTA SEPTEMBER TWENTIETH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE A WITNESS OF THIS FALL SAYS
3240-131231-0063 THE MOST STRANGE THING WHICH EVER STRUCK ME WAS THAT THE FISH DID NOT FALL HELTER SKELTER OR HERE AND THERE BUT THEY FELL IN A STRAIGHT LINE NOT MORE THAN A CUBIT IN BREADTH
3240-131231-0064 THAT ACCORDING TO TESTIMONY TAKEN BEFORE A MAGISTRATE A FALL OCCURRED FEBRUARY NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NEAR FERIDPOOR INDIA OF MANY FISHES OF VARIOUS SIZES SOME WHOLE AND FRESH AND OTHERS MUTILATED AND PUTREFYING
3240-131231-0065 OR TO THOSE WHO HOLD OUT FOR SEGREGATION IN A WHIRLWIND OR THAT OBJECTS SAY TWICE AS HEAVY AS OTHERS WOULD BE SEPARATED FROM THE LIGHTER WE POINT OUT THAT SOME OF THESE FISHES WERE TWICE AS HEAVY AS OTHERS IN THE JOURNAL OF THE ASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL
3240-131231-0066 SOME OF THE FISH WERE FRESH BUT OTHERS WERE ROTTEN AND WITHOUT HEADS AMONG THE NUMBER WHICH I GOT FIVE WERE FRESH AND THE REST STINKING AND HEADLESS THEY REMIND US OF HIS GRACE'S OBSERVATION OF SOME PAGES BACK
3240-131231-0067 ACCORDING TO DOCTOR BUIST SOME OF THESE FISHES WEIGHED ONE AND A HALF POUNDS EACH AND OTHERS THREE POUNDS A FALL OF FISHES AT FUTTEPOOR INDIA MAY SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE THEY WERE ALL DEAD AND DRY
3240-131231-0068 A CORRESPONDENT WRITES FROM THE DOVE MARINE LABORATORY CUTTERCOATS ENGLAND THAT AT HINDON A SUBURB OF SUNDERLAND AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS OF SMALL FISHES IDENTIFIED AS SAND EELS HAD FALLEN
3240-131231-0069 AGAIN THE SMALL AREA ABOUT SIXTY BY THIRTY YARDS THE FALL OCCURRED DURING A HEAVY RAIN THAT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THUNDER
3240-131231-0070 BUT BY NO VISIBLE LIGHTNING THE SEA IS CLOSE TO HINDON BUT IF YOU TRY TO THINK OF THESE FISHES HAVING DESCRIBED A TRAJECTORY IN A WHIRLWIND FROM THE OCEAN CONSIDER THIS REMARKABLE DATUM THAT
3240-131231-0071 ACCORDING TO WITNESSES THE FALL UPON THIS SMALL AREA OCCUPIED TEN MINUTES I CANNOT THINK OF A CLEARER INDICATION OF A DIRECT FALL FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE AND
3240-131231-0072 THE FISH WERE ALL DEAD AND INDEED STIFF AND HARD WHEN PICKED UP IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OCCURRENCE BY ALL OF WHICH I MEAN THAT WE HAVE ONLY BEGUN TO PILE UP OUR DATA OF THINGS THAT FALL FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE OVERHEAD
3240-131231-0073 WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE UP THE SUBJECT FROM MANY APPROACHES BEFORE OUR ACCEPTANCE WHICH SEEMS QUITE AS RIGOROUSLY ARRIVED AT AS EVER HAS BEEN A BELIEF CAN EMERGE FROM THE ACCURSED I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THE HORSE AND THE BARN WILL HELP US TO EMERGE
3240-131231-0074 BUT IF EVER ANYTHING DID GO UP FROM THIS EARTH'S SURFACE AND STAY UP THOSE DAMNED THINGS MAY HAVE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW MAY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IN A TORNADO IN WISCONSIN MAY TWENTY THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT
3240-131231-0075 A BARN AND A HORSE WERE CARRIED COMPLETELY AWAY AND NEITHER HORSE NOR BARN NOR ANY PORTION OF EITHER HAVE SINCE BEEN FOUND AFTER THAT WHICH WOULD BE A LITTLE STRONG WERE IT NOT FOR A STEADY IMPROVEMENT IN OUR DIGESTIONS THAT I NOTE AS WE GO ALONG
3240-131231-0076 THERE IS LITTLE OF THE BIZARRE OR THE UNASSIMILABLE IN THE TURTLE THAT HOVERED SIX MONTHS OR SO OVER A SMALL TOWN IN MISSISSIPPI MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW MAY EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
3240-131231-0077 FELL A SMALL PIECE OF ALABASTER THAT AT BOVINA EIGHT MILES FROM VICKSBURG FELL A GOPHER TURTLE THEY FELL IN A HAILSTORM THIS ITEM WAS WIDELY COPIED AT THE TIME FOR INSTANCE NATURE
3240-131231-0078 AS TO DISCUSSION NOT A WORD OR SCIENCE AND ITS CONTINUITY WITH PRESBYTERIANISM DATA LIKE THIS ARE DAMNED AT BIRTH THE WEATHER REVIEW DOES SPRINKLE OR BAPTIZE OR ATTEMPT TO SAVE THIS INFANT
3240-131231-0079 BUT IN ALL THE METEOROLOGICAL LITERATURE THAT I HAVE GONE THROUGH AFTER THAT DATE NOT A WORD EXCEPT MENTION ONCE OR TWICE THE EDITOR OF THE REVIEW SAYS
3240-131231-0080 AN EXAMINATION OF THE WEATHER MAP SHOWS THAT THESE HAILSTORMS OCCUR ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF A REGION OF COLD NORTHERLY WINDS AND WERE BUT A SMALL PART OF A SERIES OF SIMILAR STORMS
3240-131231-0081 OF ALL INCREDIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE TO CHOOSE FROM I GIVE FIRST PLACE TO A NOTION OF A WHIRLWIND POUNCING UPON A REGION
3240-131231-0082 THIS TIME THE OTHER MECHANICAL THING THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE CANNOT RISE IN RESPONSE TO ITS STIMULUS IT IS RESISTED IN THAT THESE OBJECTS WERE COATED WITH ICE MONTH OF MAY IN A SOUTHERN STATE IF A WHIRLWIND AT ALL
3240-131231-0083 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY LIMITED SELECTION THERE IS NO RECORD OF THE FALL OF OTHER OBJECTS BUT THERE IS NO ATTEMPT IN THE REVIEW TO SPECIFY A WHIRLWIND THESE STRANGELY ASSOCIATED THINGS WERE REMARKABLY SEPARATED THEY FELL EIGHT MILES APART
3240-131231-0084 THEN AS IF THERE WERE REAL REASONING THEY MUST HAVE BEEN HIGH TO FALL WITH SUCH DIVERGENCE OR ONE OF THEM MUST HAVE BEEN CARRIED PARTLY HORIZONTALLY EIGHT MILES FARTHER THAN THE OTHER BUT EITHER SUPPOSITION ARGUES FOR POWER MORE THAN THAT OF A LOCAL WHIRL OR GUST
3240-131231-0085 OR ARGUES FOR A GREAT SPECIFIC DISTURBANCE OF WHICH THERE IS NO RECORD FOR THE MONTH OF MAY EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
3240-131232-0000 THEN I THINK OF A HURRICANE THAT OCCURRED IN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI WEEKS OR MONTHS BEFORE MAY ELEVENTH EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR NO I DON'T LOOK FOR IT AND INEVITABLY FIND IT OR THAT THINGS CAN GO UP SO HIGH IN HURRICANES THAT THEY STAY UP INDEFINITELY
3240-131232-0001 BUT MAY AFTER A WHILE BE SHAKEN DOWN BY STORMS
3240-131232-0002 SO THEN THAT THE TURTLE AND THE PIECE OF ALABASTER MAY HAVE HAD FAR DIFFERENT ORIGINS FROM DIFFERENT WORLDS PERHAPS HAVE ENTERED A REGION OF SUSPENSION OVER THIS EARTH WAFTING NEAR EACH OTHER LONG DURATION
3240-131232-0003 FINAL PRECIPITATION BY ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE WITH HAIL OR THAT HAILSTONES TOO WHEN LARGE ARE PHENOMENA OF SUSPENSION OF LONG DURATION THAT IT IS HIGHLY UNACCEPTABLE THAT THE VERY LARGE ONES COULD BECOME SO GREAT ONLY IN FALLING FROM THE CLOUDS
3240-131232-0004 LONG DURATION OTHER INDICATIONS OF LONG DURATION I THINK OF A REGION SOMEWHERE ABOVE THIS EARTH'S SURFACE IN WHICH GRAVITATION IS INOPERATIVE AND IS NOT GOVERNED BY THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE
3240-131232-0005 QUITE AS MAGNETISM IS NEGLIGIBLE AT A VERY SHORT DISTANCE FROM A MAGNET THEORETICALLY THE ATTRACTION OF A MAGNET SHOULD DECREASE WITH THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE BUT THE FALLING OFF IS FOUND TO BE ALMOST ABRUPT AT A SHORT DISTANCE
3240-131232-0006 HORSES AND BARNS AND ELEPHANTS AND FLIES AND DODOES MOAS AND PTERODACTYLS LEAVES FROM MODERN TREES AND LEAVES OF THE CARBONIFEROUS ERA ALL HOWEVER TENDING TO DISINTEGRATE INTO HOMOGENEOUS LOOKING MUDS OR DUSTS
3240-131232-0007 RED OR BLACK OR YELLOW TREASURE TROVES FOR THE PALAEONTOLOGISTS AND FOR THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS ACCUMULATIONS OF CENTURIES CYCLONES OF EGYPT GREECE AND ASSYRIA FISHES DRIED AND HARD THERE A SHORT TIME OTHERS THERE LONG ENOUGH TO PUTREFY
3240-131232-0008 BUT THE OMNIPRESENCE OF HETEROGENEITY OR LIVING FISHES ALSO PONDS OF FRESH WATER OCEANS OF SALT WATER AS TO THE LAW OF GRAVITATION I PREFER TO TAKE ONE SIMPLE STAND
3240-131232-0009 ORTHODOXY ACCEPTS THE CORRELATION AND EQUIVALENCE OF FORCES GRAVITATION IS ONE OF THESE FORCES ALL OTHER FORCES HAVE PHENOMENA OF REPULSION AND OF INERTNESS IRRESPECTIVE OF DISTANCE AS WELL AS OF ATTRACTION
3240-131232-0010 BUT NEWTONIAN GRAVITATION ADMITS ATTRACTION ONLY THEN NEWTONIAN GRAVITATION CAN BE ONLY ONE THIRD ACCEPTABLE EVEN TO THE ORTHODOX OR THERE IS DENIAL OF THE CORRELATION AND EQUIVALENCE OF FORCES OR STILL SIMPLER HERE ARE THE DATA
3240-131232-0011 THOUGH IT HARMONIZES WITH DATA OF FISHES THAT FALL AS IF FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE AND OF COURSE WITH OTHER DATA TOO IS INADEQUATE TO ACCOUNT FOR TWO PECULIARITIES OF THE FALLS OF FROGS THAT NEVER HAS A FALL OF TADPOLES BEEN REPORTED
3240-131232-0012 THAT NEVER HAS A FALL OF FULL GROWN FROGS BEEN REPORTED ALWAYS FROGS A FEW MONTHS OLD IT SOUNDS POSITIVE BUT IF THERE BE SUCH REPORTS THEY ARE SOMEWHERE OUT OF MY RANGE OF READING BUT TADPOLES WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO FALL FROM THE SKY THAN WOULD FROGS
3240-131232-0013 LITTLE OR BIG IF SUCH FALLS BE ATTRIBUTED TO WHIRLWINDS AND MORE LIKELY TO FALL FROM THE SUPER SARGASSO SEA IF THOUGH VERY TENTATIVELY AND PROVISIONALLY WE ACCEPT THE SUPER SARGASSO SEA
3240-131232-0014 BEFORE WE TAKE UP AN ESPECIAL EXPRESSION UPON THE FALL OF IMMATURE AND LARVAL FORMS OF LIFE TO THIS EARTH AND THE NECESSITY THEN OF CONCEIVING OF SOME FACTOR BESIDES MERE STATIONARINESS OR SUSPENSION OR STAGNATION
3240-131232-0015 THERE ARE OTHER DATA THAT ARE SIMILAR TO DATA OF FALLS OF FISHES SCIENCE GOSSIP
3240-131232-0016 THAT SMALL SNAILS OF A LAND SPECIES HAD FALLEN NEAR REDRUTH CORNWALL JULY EIGHTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX DURING A HEAVY THUNDERSTORM ROADS AND FIELDS STREWN WITH THEM SO THAT THEY WERE GATHERED UP BY THE HATFUL
3240-131232-0017 NONE SEEN TO FALL BY THE WRITER OF THIS ACCOUNT SNAILS SAID TO BE QUITE DIFFERENT TO ANY PREVIOUSLY KNOWN IN THIS DISTRICT
3240-131232-0018 OF GREAT AND DESERVED REPUTE I THOUGHT I SHOULD FOR ONCE LIKE TO TRACE THE ORIGIN OF ONE OF THESE FABULOUS TALES OUR OWN ACCEPTANCE IS THAT JUSTICE CANNOT BE IN AN INTERMEDIATE EXISTENCE
3240-131232-0019 IN WHICH THERE CAN BE APPROXIMATION ONLY TO JUSTICE OR TO INJUSTICE THAT TO BE FAIR IS TO HAVE NO OPINION AT ALL THAT TO BE HONEST IS TO BE UNINTERESTED THAT TO INVESTIGATE IS TO ADMIT PREJUDICE THAT NOBODY HAS EVER REALLY INVESTIGATED ANYTHING
3240-131232-0020 BUT HAS ALWAYS SOUGHT POSITIVELY TO PROVE OR TO DISPROVE SOMETHING THAT WAS CONCEIVED OF OR SUSPECTED IN ADVANCE AS I SUSPECTED SAYS THIS CORRESPONDENT I FOUND THAT THE SNAILS WERE OF A FAMILIAR LAND SPECIES THAT THEY HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND
3240-131232-0021 IN THE FIRST PLACE HE FOUND THAT THE SNAILS HAD APPEARED AFTER THE RAIN THAT ASTONISHED RUSTICS HAD JUMPED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY HAD FALLEN HE MET ONE PERSON WHO SAID THAT HE HAD SEEN THE SNAILS FALL THIS WAS HIS ERROR SAYS THE INVESTIGATOR
3240-131232-0022 IN SUCH QUANTITIES THAT THEY WERE SHOVELED UP IT IS SAID THAT THE SNAILS MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A LOCAL SPECIES
3240-131232-0023 AND THAT IN HIS OPINION THEY HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME UNUSUAL CONDITION ALOFT COMES OUT IN HIS OBSERVATION UPON THE CURIOUS AZURE BLUE APPEARANCE OF THE SUN AT THE TIME
3240-131232-0024 THAT ACCORDING TO DAS WETTER DECEMBER EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO UPON AUGUST NINTH EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO A YELLOW CLOUD APPEARED OVER PADERBORN GERMANY FROM THIS CLOUD FELL A TORRENTIAL RAIN IN WHICH WERE HUNDREDS OF MUSSELS
3240-131232-0025 THERE IS NO MENTION OF WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE NOR OF A WHIRLWIND LIZARDS
3240-131232-0026 THAT DURING A HEAVY SHOWER JULY THIRD EIGHTEEN SIXTY HE HEARD A PECULIAR SOUND AT HIS FEET AND LOOKING DOWN SAW A SNAKE LYING AS IF STUNNED BY A FALL IT THEN CAME TO LIFE GRAY SNAKE ABOUT A FOOT LONG
3240-131232-0027 THESE DATA HAVE ANY MEANING OR LACK OF MEANING OR DEGREE OF DAMNATION YOU PLEASE BUT IN THE MATTER OF THE FALL THAT OCCURRED AT MEMPHIS TENNESSEE OCCUR SOME STRONG SIGNIFICANCES
3240-131232-0028 OUR QUASI REASONING UPON THIS SUBJECT APPLIES TO ALL SEGREGATIONS SO FAR CONSIDERED MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THAT
3240-131232-0029 RATHER STRICTLY LOCALIZED OR IN A SPACE OF TWO BLOCKS AND AFTER A VIOLENT STORM IN WHICH THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS SNAKES WERE FOUND THEY WERE CRAWLING ON SIDEWALKS IN YARDS AND IN STREETS AND IN MASSES
3240-131232-0030 BUT NONE WERE FOUND ON ROOFS OR ANY OTHER ELEVATION ABOVE GROUND AND NONE WERE SEEN TO FALL IF YOU PREFER TO BELIEVE THAT THE SNAKES HAD ALWAYS BEEN THERE OR HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT IT WAS ONLY THAT SOMETHING OCCURRED TO CALL SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THEM
3240-131232-0031 IN THE STREETS OF MEMPHIS JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WHY THAT'S SENSIBLE THAT'S THE COMMON SENSE THAT HAS BEEN AGAINST US FROM THE FIRST IT IS NOT SAID WHETHER THE SNAKES WERE OF A KNOWN SPECIES OR NOT
3240-131232-0032 AND HAD NOT BEEN IN THE STREETS CRAWLING LOOSE OR IN THICK TANGLED MASSES IN THE FIRST PLACE IF WE TRY TO ACCEPT THAT THESE SNAKES HAD BEEN RAISED FROM SOME OTHER PART OF THIS EARTH'S SURFACE IN A WHIRLWIND IF WE TRY TO ACCEPT THAT A WHIRLWIND COULD SEGREGATE THEM
3240-131232-0033 STONES FENCE RAILS LIMBS OF TREES SAY THAT THE SNAKES OCCUPIED THE NEXT GRADATION AND WOULD BE THE NEXT TO FALL
3240-131232-0034 AGAIN OURS IS THE OBJECTION AGAINST SUCH SELECTIVENESS BY A WHIRLWIND CONCEIVABLY A WHIRLWIND COULD SCOOP OUT A DEN OF HIBERNATING SNAKES WITH STONES AND EARTH AND AN INFINITUDE OF OTHER DEBRIS SNATCHING UP DOZENS OF SNAKES
3240-131232-0035 I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TO A DEN HUNDREDS MAYBE BUT ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNT OF THIS OCCURRENCE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF THEM ALIVE FROM ONE FOOT TO EIGHTEEN INCHES IN LENGTH
3240-131232-0036 RECORDS THE FALL AND SAYS THAT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF THEM THE USUAL WHIRLWIND EXPLANATION IS GIVEN BUT IN WHAT LOCALITY SNAKES EXIST IN SUCH ABUNDANCE IS YET A MYSTERY THIS MATTER OF ENORMOUSNESS OF NUMBERS
3240-131232-0037 SUGGESTS TO ME SOMETHING OF A MIGRATORY NATURE BUT THAT SNAKES IN THE UNITED STATES DO NOT MIGRATE IN THE MONTH OF JANUARY IF EVER AS TO FALLS OR FLUTTERINGS OF WINGED INSECTS FROM THE SKY PREVAILING NOTIONS OF SWARMING WOULD SEEM EXPLANATORY ENOUGH
3240-131232-0038 FALL OF FISHES JUNE THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE IN HOLLAND ANTS AUGUST FIRST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE STRASBOURG LITTLE TOADS AUGUST SECOND EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE SAVOY
3240-131232-0039 FALL OF ANTS CAMBRIDGE ENGLAND SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR SOME WERE WINGLESS
3240-131232-0040 ENORMOUS FALL OF ANTS NANCY FRANCE JULY TWENTY FIRST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN MOST OF THEM WERE WINGLESS
3242-67153-0000 AND FINDS A FAIR MARGIN OF PROFIT IN SHOVING IT THERE'S A CHANCE FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE LEARNED FROM LATIN TO POETRY IN THE PACKING BUSINESS THOUGH WE DON'T USE MUCH POETRY HERE EXCEPT IN OUR STREET CAR ADS
3242-67153-0001 AND ABOUT THE ONLY TIME OUR PRODUCTS ARE GIVEN LATIN NAMES IS WHEN THE STATE BOARD OF HEALTH CONDEMNS THEM SO I THINK YOU'LL FIND IT SAFE TO GO SHORT A LITTLE ON THE FRILLS OF EDUCATION IF YOU WANT THEM BAD ENOUGH YOU'LL FIND A WAY TO PICK THEM UP LATER AFTER BUSINESS HOURS
3242-67153-0002 BUT I WANTED YOU TO FORM GOOD MENTAL HABITS JUST AS I WANT YOU TO HAVE CLEAN STRAIGHT PHYSICAL ONES BECAUSE I WAS RUN THROUGH A THRESHING MACHINE WHEN I WAS A BOY AND DIDN'T BEGIN TO GET THE STRAW OUT OF MY HAIR TILL I WAS PAST THIRTY
3242-67153-0003 I HAVEN'T ANY SYMPATHY WITH A LOT OF THESE OLD FELLOWS WHO GO AROUND BRAGGING OF THEIR IGNORANCE AND SAYING THAT BOYS DON'T NEED TO KNOW ANYTHING EXCEPT ADDITION AND THE BEST POLICY BRAND OF HONESTY WE STARTED IN A MIGHTY DIFFERENT WORLD AND WE WERE ALL IGNORANT TOGETHER
3242-67153-0004 THE LORD LET US IN ON THE GROUND FLOOR GAVE US CORNER LOTS AND THEN STARTED IN TO IMPROVE THE ADJACENT PROPERTY WE DIDN'T HAVE TO KNOW FRACTIONS TO FIGURE OUT OUR PROFITS NOW A MERCHANT NEEDS ASTRONOMY TO SEE THEM AND WHEN HE LOCATES THEM THEY ARE OUT SOMEWHERE NEAR THE FIFTH DECIMAL PLACE
3242-67153-0005 AND THERE'RE JUST AS MANY CHANCES FOR A FELLOW AS EVER BUT THEY'RE A LITTLE GUN SHY AND YOU CAN'T CATCH THEM BY ANY SUCH COARSE METHOD AS PUTTING SALT ON THEIR TAILS THIRTY YEARS AGO YOU COULD TAKE AN OLD MUZZLE LOADER AND KNOCK OVER PLENTY OF DUCKS IN THE CITY LIMITS
3242-67153-0006 AND CHICAGO WASN'T COOK COUNTY THEN EITHER YOU CAN GET THEM STILL BUT YOU'VE GOT TO GO TO KANKAKEE AND TAKE A HAMMERLESS ALONG AND WHEN I STARTED IN THE PACKING BUSINESS IT WAS ALL STRAIGHT SAILING NO FRILLS JUST TURNING HOGS INTO HOG MEAT
3242-67153-0007 DRY SALT FOR THE NIGGERS DOWN SOUTH AND SUGAR CURED FOR THE WHITE FOLKS UP NORTH EVERYTHING ELSE WAS SAUSAGE OR THROWN AWAY BUT WHEN WE GET THROUGH WITH A HOG NOWADAYS HE'S SCATTERED THROUGH A HUNDRED DIFFERENT CANS AND PACKAGES AND HE'S ALL ACCOUNTED FOR WHAT WE USED TO THROW AWAY IS OUR PROFIT
3242-67153-0008 IT TAKES DOCTORS LAWYERS ENGINEERS POETS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO RUN THE BUSINESS AND I RECKON THAT IMPROVEMENTS WHICH CALL FOR PARSONS WILL BE CREEPING IN NEXT NATURALLY A YOUNG MAN WHO EXPECTS TO HOLD HIS OWN WHEN HE IS THROWN IN WITH A LOT OF MEN LIKE THESE
3242-67153-0009 MUST BE AS CLEAN AND SHARP AS A HOUND'S TOOTH OR SOME OTHER FELLOW'S SIMPLY GOING TO EAT HIM UP THE FIRST COLLEGE MAN I EVER HIRED WAS OLD JOHN DURHAM'S SON JIM THAT WAS A GOOD MANY YEARS AGO WHEN THE HOUSE WAS A MUCH SMALLER AFFAIR
3242-67153-0010 BUT OLD DURHAM FOUND OUT WHAT EVERY ONE LEARNS WHO GETS HIS AMBITIONS MIXED UP WITH NUMBER TWO RED THAT THERE'S A HEAP OF IT LYING AROUND LOOSE IN THE COUNTRY THE BEARS DID QUICK WORK AND KEPT THE CASH WHEAT COMING IN SO LIVELY THAT ONE SETTLING DAY
3242-67153-0011 AND THAT HE HAD BETTER TURN HIS ATTENTION TO THE STOCKS OF MESS PORK
3242-67153-0012 HE APPLIED FOR EVERY OTHER POSITION ON THE PREMISES RIGHT DOWN TO OFFICE BOY I TOLD HIM I WAS SORRY BUT I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR HIM THEN THAT WE WERE LETTING MEN GO BUT I'D KEEP HIM IN MIND AND SO ON
3242-67153-0013 FINALLY AFTER ABOUT A MONTH OF THIS HE WORE ME DOWN SO THAT I STOPPED HIM ONE DAY AS HE WAS PASSING ME ON THE STREET I THOUGHT I'D FIND OUT IF HE REALLY WAS SO RED HOT TO WORK AS HE PRETENDED TO BE
3242-67153-0014 BESIDES I FELT THAT PERHAPS I HADN'T TREATED THE BOY JUST RIGHT AS I HAD DELIVERED QUITE A JAG OF THAT WHEAT TO HIS FATHER MYSELF HELLO JIM I CALLED DO YOU STILL WANT THAT JOB YES SIR HE ANSWERED QUICK AS LIGHTNING WELL
3242-67153-0015 I TELL YOU HOW IT IS JIM I SAID LOOKING UP AT HIM HE WAS ONE OF THOSE HUSKY LAZY MOVING SIX FOOTERS I DON'T SEE ANY CHANCE IN THE OFFICE BUT I UNDERSTAND THEY CAN USE ANOTHER GOOD STRONG MAN IN ONE OF THE LOADING GANGS
3242-67153-0016 I THOUGHT THAT WOULD SETTLE JIM AND LET ME OUT FOR IT'S NO JOKE LUGGING BEEF OR ROLLING BARRELS AND TIERCES A HUNDRED YARDS OR SO TO THE CARS BUT JIM CAME RIGHT BACK AT ME WITH DONE WHO'LL I REPORT TO
3242-67153-0017 THAT SPORTY WAY OF ANSWERING AS IF HE WAS CLOSING A BET MADE ME SURER THAN EVER THAT HE WAS NOT CUT OUT FOR A BUTCHER BUT I TOLD HIM AND OFF HE STARTED HOT FOOT TO FIND THE FOREMAN I SENT WORD BY ANOTHER ROUTE TO SEE THAT HE GOT PLENTY TO DO
3242-67153-0018 HE GOT TO SCHEMING AROUND FOR A WAY TO MAKE THE WORK EASIER AND HE HIT ON AN IDEA FOR A SORT OF OVERHEAD RAILROAD SYSTEM BY WHICH THE BARRELS COULD BE SWUNG OUT OF THE STOREROOMS AND RUN RIGHT ALONG INTO THE CARS
3242-67153-0019 IT WAS JUST AS I THOUGHT JIM WAS LAZY BUT HE HAD PUT THE HOUSE IN THE WAY OF SAVING SO MUCH MONEY THAT I COULDN'T FIRE HIM SO I RAISED HIS SALARY AND MADE HIM AN ASSISTANT TIMEKEEPER AND CHECKER
3242-67153-0020 JIM KEPT AT THIS FOR THREE OR FOUR MONTHS UNTIL HIS FEET BEGAN TO HURT HIM I GUESS AND THEN HE WAS OUT OF A JOB AGAIN IT SEEMS HE HAD HEARD SOMETHING OF A NEW MACHINE FOR REGISTERING THE MEN THAT DID AWAY WITH MOST OF THE TIMEKEEPERS EXCEPT THE FELLOWS WHO WATCHED THE MACHINES
3242-67153-0021 OF COURSE HE CLAIMED A RAISE AGAIN FOR EFFECTING SUCH A SAVING
3242-67153-0022 I WAS BEGINNING TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN JIM SO I BROUGHT HIM UP INTO THE OFFICE AND SET HIM TO COPYING CIRCULAR LETTERS WE USED TO SEND OUT A RAFT OF THEM TO THE TRADE THAT WAS JUST BEFORE THE GENERAL ADOPTION OF TYPEWRITERS WHEN THEY WERE STILL IN THE EXPERIMENTAL STAGE
3242-67153-0023 BUT JIM HADN'T BEEN IN THE OFFICE PLUGGING AWAY AT THE LETTERS FOR A MONTH BEFORE HE HAD THE WRITER'S CRAMP AND BEGAN NOSING AROUND AGAIN THE FIRST THING I KNEW HE WAS SICKING THE AGENTS FOR THE NEW TYPEWRITING MACHINE ON TO ME
3242-67153-0024 AND HE KEPT THEM POUNDING AWAY UNTIL THEY HAD MADE ME GIVE THEM A TRIAL THEN IT WAS ALL UP WITH MISTER JIM'S JOB AGAIN
3242-67153-0025 JIM MADE TWO TRIPS WITHOUT SELLING ENOUGH TO KEEP THEM WORKING OVERTIME AT THE FACTORY AND THEN HE CAME INTO MY OFFICE WITH A LONG STORY ABOUT HOW WE WERE DOING IT ALL WRONG SAID WE OUGHT TO GO FOR THE CONSUMER BY ADVERTISING
3242-67153-0026 BUT JIM JUST KEPT PLUGGING AWAY AT ME BETWEEN TRIPS UNTIL FINALLY I TOOK HIM OFF THE ROAD AND TOLD HIM TO GO AHEAD AND TRY IT IN A SMALL WAY JIM PRETTY NEARLY SCARED ME TO DEATH THAT FIRST YEAR
3242-67153-0027 AT LAST HE HAD GOT INTO SOMETHING THAT HE TOOK AN INTEREST IN SPENDING MONEY AND HE JUST FAIRLY WALLOWED IN IT USED TO LAY AWAKE NIGHTS THINKING UP NEW WAYS OF GETTING RID OF THE OLD MAN'S PROFITS
3242-67153-0028 I REMEMBER ONE PICTURE HE GOT OUT SHOWING SIXTEEN COWS STANDING BETWEEN SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A LETTER PRESS AND TELLING HOW EVERY POUND OR SO OF GRAHAM'S EXTRACT CONTAINED THE JUICE SQUEEZED FROM A HERD OF STEERS IF AN EXPLORER STARTED FOR THE NORTH POLE
3242-67153-0029 JIM WOULD SEND HIM A CASE OF EXTRACT AND THEN ADVERTISE THAT IT WAS THE GREAT HEAT MAKER FOR COLD CLIMATES AND IF SOME OTHER FELLOW STARTED ACROSS AFRICA HE SENT HIM A CASE TOO AND ADVERTISED WHAT A BULLY DRINK IT WAS SERVED UP WITH A LITTLE ICE
3242-67153-0030 HE BROKE OUT IN A NEW PLACE EVERY DAY AND EVERY TIME HE BROKE OUT IT COST THE HOUSE MONEY FINALLY I MADE UP MY MIND TO SWALLOW THE LOSS AND MISTER JIM WAS JUST ABOUT TO LOSE HIS JOB SURE ENOUGH
3242-67153-0031 WHEN THE ORDERS FOR EXTRACT BEGAN TO LOOK UP AND HE GOT A REPRIEVE THEN HE BEGAN TO MAKE EXPENSES AND HE GOT A PARDON AND FINALLY A RUSH CAME THAT LEFT HIM HIGH AND DRY IN A PERMANENT PLACE
3242-67153-0032 JIM WAS ALL RIGHT IN HIS WAY BUT IT WAS A NEW WAY AND I HADN'T BEEN BROAD GAUGED ENOUGH TO SEE THAT IT WAS A BETTER WAY THAT WAS WHERE I CAUGHT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN A COLLEGE EDUCATION AND BUSINESS
3242-67153-0033 I'VE ALWAYS MADE IT A RULE TO BUY BRAINS AND I'VE LEARNED NOW THAT THE BETTER TRAINED THEY ARE THE FASTER THEY FIND REASONS FOR GETTING THEIR SALARIES RAISED THE FELLOW WHO HASN'T HAD THE TRAINING MAY BE JUST AS SMART BUT HE'S APT TO PAW THE AIR WHEN HE'S REACHING FOR IDEAS
3242-67153-0034 I SUPPOSE YOU'RE ASKING WHY IF I'M SO HOT FOR EDUCATION I'M AGAINST THIS POST GRADUATE COURSE
3242-67153-0035 I SEE YOU'VE BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT OF YOUR CLASS I'M GLAD THE BOYS AREN'T DOWN ON YOU BUT WHILE THE MOST POPULAR MAN IN HIS CLASS ISN'T ALWAYS A FAILURE IN BUSINESS BEING AS POPULAR AS THAT TAKES UP A HEAP OF TIME
3242-67153-0036 I NOTICED TOO WHEN YOU WERE HOME EASTER THAT YOU WERE RUNNING TO SPORTY CLOTHES AND CIGARETTES THERE'S NOTHING CRIMINAL ABOUT EITHER BUT I DON'T HIRE SPORTY CLERKS AT ALL AND THE ONLY PART OF THE PREMISES ON WHICH CIGARETTE SMOKING IS ALLOWED IS THE FERTILIZER FACTORY
3242-67153-0037 I SIMPLY MENTION THIS IN PASSING I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE IN YOUR ULTIMATE GOOD SENSE AND I GUESS YOU'LL SEE THE POINT WITHOUT MY ELABORATING WITH A MEAT AX MY REASONS FOR THINKING THAT YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH COLLEGE FOR THE PRESENT
3242-67168-0000 I NEVER SELL GOODS WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE I CAN FIND THEM WHEN I WANT THEM AND IF THESE FELLOWS TRY TO PUT THEIR FOREFEET IN THE TROUGH OR START ANY SHOVING AND CROWDING THEY'RE GOING TO FIND ME FORGETTING MY TABLE MANNERS TOO
3242-67168-0001 FOR WHEN IT COMES TO FUNNY BUSINESS I'M SOMETHING OF A HUMORIST MYSELF AND WHILE I'M TOO OLD TO RUN I'M YOUNG ENOUGH TO STAND AND FIGHT FIRST AND LAST A GOOD MANY MEN HAVE GONE GUNNING FOR ME BUT THEY'VE ALWAYS PLANNED THE OBSEQUIES BEFORE THEY CAUGHT THE DECEASED
3242-67168-0002 I RECKON THERE HASN'T BEEN A TIME IN TWENTY YEARS WHEN THERE WASN'T A NICE GATES AJAR PIECE ALL MADE UP AND READY FOR ME IN SOME OFFICE NEAR THE BOARD OF TRADE BUT THE FIRST ESSENTIAL OF A QUIET FUNERAL IS A WILLING CORPSE AND I'M STILL SITTING UP AND TAKING NOURISHMENT
3242-67168-0003 ABUSE AND FLATTERY THE FIRST CAN'T HARM YOU AND THE SECOND CAN'T HELP YOU SOME MEN ARE LIKE YELLOW DOGS
3242-67168-0004 LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS BULLING THE MARKET THE LONGS ALL SAID THAT I WAS A KIND HEARTED OLD PHILANTHROPIST WHO WAS LAYING AWAKE NIGHTS SCHEMING TO GET THE FARMERS A TOP PRICE FOR THEIR HOGS
3242-67168-0005 AND THE SHORTS ALLOWED THAT I WAS AN INFAMOUS OLD ROBBER WHO WAS STEALING THE PORK OUT OF THE WORKINGMAN'S POT AS LONG AS YOU CAN'T PLEASE BOTH SIDES IN THIS WORLD THERE'S NOTHING LIKE PLEASING YOUR OWN SIDE
3242-67168-0006 I REMEMBER ONCE I HAD A VACANT LOT OUT ON THE AVENUE AND A LADY CAME IN TO MY OFFICE AND IN A SOOTHING SYRUPY WAY ASKED IF I WOULD LEND IT TO HER AS SHE WANTED TO BUILD A CRECHE ON IT I HESITATED A LITTLE BECAUSE I HAD NEVER HEARD OF A CRECHE BEFORE
3242-67168-0007 AND SOMEWAYS IT SOUNDED SORT OF FOREIGN AND FRISKY THOUGH THE WOMAN LOOKED LIKE A GOOD SAFE RELIABLE OLD HEIFER BUT SHE EXPLAINED THAT A CRECHE WAS A BABY FARM WHERE OLD MAIDS WENT TO WASH AND FEED AND STICK PINS IN OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN WHILE THEIR MOTHERS WERE OFF AT WORK
3242-67168-0008 OF COURSE THERE WAS NOTHING IN THAT TO GET OUR PASTOR OR THE POLICE AFTER ME SO I TOLD HER TO GO AHEAD SHE WENT OFF HAPPY BUT ABOUT A WEEK LATER SHE DROPPED IN AGAIN LOOKING SORT OF DISSATISFIED TO FIND OUT IF I WOULDN'T BUILD THE CRECHE ITSELF
3242-67168-0009 IT SEEMED LIKE A WORTHY OBJECT SO I SENT SOME CARPENTERS OVER TO KNOCK TOGETHER A LONG FRAME PAVILION SHE WAS MIGHTY GRATEFUL YOU BET AND I DIDN'T SEE HER AGAIN FOR A FORTNIGHT THEN SHE CALLED BY TO SAY THAT SO LONG AS I WAS IN THE BUSINESS AND THEY DIDN'T COST ME ANYTHING SPECIAL
3242-67168-0010 WOULD I MIND GIVING HER A FEW COWS SHE HAD A SURPRISED AND GRIEVED EXPRESSION ON HER FACE AS SHE TALKED AND THE WAY SHE PUT IT MADE ME FEEL THAT I OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF MYSELF FOR NOT HAVING THOUGHT OF THE LIVE STOCK MYSELF SO I THREW IN HALF A DOZEN COWS TO PROVIDE THE REFRESHMENTS
3242-67168-0011 TO ASK WHY I HADN'T HAD IT PAINTED I WAS TOO BUSY THAT MORNING TO QUARREL SO I SENT WORD THAT I WOULD FIX IT UP AND WHEN I WAS DRIVING BY THERE NEXT DAY THE PAINTERS WERE HARD AT WORK ON IT
3242-67168-0012 GRAHAM'S EXTRACT IT MAKES THE WEAK STRONG
3242-67168-0013 WENT ALL AROUND TOWN SAYING THAT I HAD GIVEN A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR SHED TO CHARITY AND PAINTED A THOUSAND DOLLAR AD ON IT ALLOWED I OUGHT TO SEND MY CHECK FOR THAT AMOUNT TO THE CRECHE FUND KEPT AT IT TILL I BEGAN TO THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING IN IT AFTER ALL AND SENT HER THE MONEY
3242-67168-0014 THEN I FOUND A FELLOW WHO WANTED TO BUILD IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD SOLD HIM THE LOT CHEAP AND GOT OUT OF THE CRECHE INDUSTRY
3242-67168-0015 BUT THE ONLY THING I'VE EVER PUT INTO IT WHICH DIDN'T DRAW DIVIDENDS IN FUN OR DOLLARS WAS WORRY THAT IS A BRANCH OF THE TRADE WHICH YOU WANT TO LEAVE TO OUR COMPETITORS I'VE ALWAYS FOUND WORRYING A BLAMED SIGHT MORE UNCERTAIN THAN HORSE RACING IT'S HARDER TO PICK A WINNER AT IT
3242-67168-0016 YOU GO HOME WORRYING BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID THAT YOUR FOOL NEW CLERK FORGOT TO LOCK THE SAFE AFTER YOU AND DURING THE NIGHT THE LARD REFINERY BURNS DOWN YOU SPEND A YEAR FRETTING BECAUSE YOU THINK BILL JONES IS GOING TO CUT YOU OUT WITH YOUR BEST GIRL AND THEN YOU SPEND TEN WORRYING BECAUSE HE DIDN'T
3242-67168-0017 A BUSY MAN HAS NO TIME TO BOTHER WITH IT HE CAN ALWAYS FIND PLENTY OF OLD WOMEN IN SKIRTS OR TROUSERS TO SPEND THEIR DAYS WORRYING OVER THEIR OWN TROUBLES AND TO SIT UP NIGHTS WAKING HIS SPEAKING OF HANDING OVER YOUR WORRIES TO OTHERS NATURALLY CALLS TO MIND THE WIDOW WILLIAMS AND HER SON BUD
3242-67168-0018 WHO WAS A PLAYMATE OF MINE WHEN I WAS A BOY BUD WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THE WIDOW'S TROUBLES AND SHE WAS A WOMAN WHOSE TROUBLES SELDOM CAME SINGLY HAD FOURTEEN ALTOGETHER AND FOUR PAIR OF EM WERE TWINS
3242-67168-0019 AND THEN SHE'D SHED ALL WORRY OVER THEM FOR THE REST OF THE DAY ALLOWED THAT IF THEY GOT HURT THE NEIGHBORS WOULD BRING THEM HOME
3242-67168-0020 AND SOMEWAYS THE WHOLE DROVE ALWAYS SHOWED UP SAFE AND DIRTY ABOUT MEAL TIME
3242-67168-0021 AND SO WHEN BUD'S CLOTHES WERE FOUND AT THE SWIMMING HOLE ONE DAY AND NO BUD INSIDE THEM SHE DIDN'T TAKE ON UP TO THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE NEIGHBORS WHO HAD BROUGHT THE NEWS AND WHO WERE STANDING AROUND WAITING FOR HER TO GO OFF INTO SOMETHING SPECIAL IN THE WAY OF HIGH STRIKES
3242-67168-0022 HINTED THAT THERE'D BE NO FUNERAL OR SUCH LIKE EXPENSIVE GOINGS ON UNTIL SOME ONE PRODUCED THE DECEASED TAKE HER BY AND LARGE SHE WAS A PRETTY COOL CALM CUCUMBER
3242-67168-0023 AND EVERY ONE JUST QUIT WORK TO TELL EACH OTHER WHAT A NOBLE LITTLE FELLOW HE WAS AND HOW HIS MOTHER HADN'T DESERVED TO HAVE SUCH A BRIGHT LITTLE SUNBEAM IN HER HOME AND TO DRAG THE RIVER BETWEEN TALKS BUT THEY COULDN'T GET A RISE
3242-67168-0024 BUT FINALLY AT THE END OF A WEEK WHEN THEY'D STRAINED THE WHOLE RIVER THROUGH THEIR DRAGS AND HADN'T ANYTHING TO SHOW FOR IT BUT A COLLECTION OF TIN CANS AND DEAD CATFISH
3242-67168-0025 AND WENT DOWN THE STREET TO THE CABIN OF LOUISIANA CLYTEMNESTRA AN OLD YELLOW WOMAN WHO WOULD GO INTO A TRANCE FOR FOUR BITS AND FIND A FORTUNE FOR YOU FOR A DOLLAR I RECKON SHE'D HAVE CALLED HERSELF A CLAIRVOYANT NOWADAYS BUT THEN SHE WAS JUST A VOODOO WOMAN
3242-67168-0026 WELL THE WIDOW SAID SHE RECKONED THAT BOYS OUGHT TO BE LET OUT AS WELL AS IN FOR HALF PRICE AND SO SHE LAID DOWN TWO BITS ALLOWING THAT SHE WANTED A FEW MINUTES PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH HER BUD
3242-67168-0027 CLYTIE SAID SHE'D DO HER BEST BUT THAT SPIRITS WERE MIGHTY SNIFTY AND HIGH TONED EVEN WHEN THEY'D ONLY BEEN POOR WHITE TRASH ON EARTH AND IT MIGHT MAKE THEM MAD TO BE CALLED AWAY FROM THEIR HIGH JINKS IF THEY WERE TAKING A LITTLE RECREATION OR FROM THEIR HIGH PRICED NEW YORK CUSTOMERS IF THEY WERE WORKING
3242-67168-0028 BUT NEXT DAY SHE CAME AGAIN AND PAID DOWN FOUR BITS AND CLYTIE RECKONED THAT THAT OUGHT TO FETCH BUD SURE SOMEWAYS THOUGH SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY LUCK AND FINALLY THE WIDOW SUGGESTED THAT SHE CALL UP BUD'S FATHER BUCK WILLIAMS HAD BEEN DEAD A MATTER OF TEN YEARS
3242-67168-0029 AND THE OLD MAN RESPONDED PROMPTLY WHERE'S BUD ASKED THE WIDOW
3242-67168-0030 NO THEN HE'D HAVE TO LOOK DOWNSTAIRS FOR HIM CLYTIE TOLD THE WIDOW TO CALL AGAIN AND THEY'D GET HIM SURE SO SHE CAME BACK NEXT DAY AND LAID DOWN A DOLLAR THAT FETCHED OLD BUCK WILLIAMS GHOST ON THE JUMP YOU BET
3242-67168-0031 BUT THEY COULDN'T GET A WHISPER EVEN FROM BUD I RECKON CLYTIE HAD BEEN STRINGING THE OLD LADY ALONG INTENDING TO PRODUCE BUD'S SPOOK AS A SORT OF RED FIRE CALCIUM LIGHT GRAND MARCH OF THE AMAZONS CLIMAX BUT SHE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
3242-67168-0032 FOR RIGHT THERE THE OLD LADY GOT UP WITH A MIGHTY SET EXPRESSION AROUND HER LIPS AND MARCHED OUT MUTTERING THAT IT WAS JUST AS SHE HAD THOUGHT ALL ALONG BUD WASN'T THERE AND WHEN THE NEIGHBORS DROPPED IN THAT AFTERNOON TO PLAN OUT A MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR HER LOST LAMB
3242-67168-0033 SHE CHASED THEM OFF THE LOT WITH A BROOM
3242-67168-0034 AND THAT THEY WOULD JUST STAND PAT NOW AND WAIT FOR HIM TO MAKE THE NEXT MOVE
3242-67168-0035 BUT THERE WOULDN'T BE TILL THEN ALTOGETHER IT LOOKED AS IF THERE WAS A HEAP OF TROUBLE COMING TO BUD IF HE HAD MADE ANY MISTAKE AND WAS STILL ALIVE THE WIDOW FOUND HER LOST LAMB HIDING BEHIND A RAIN BARREL WHEN SHE OPENED UP THE HOUSE NEXT MORNING
3242-67168-0036 AND THERE WAS A MIGHTY TOUCHING AND AFFECTING SCENE IN FACT THE WIDOW MUST HAVE TOUCHED HIM AT LEAST A HUNDRED TIMES AND EVERY TIME HE WAS AFFECTED TO TEARS FOR SHE WAS USING A BED SLAT WHICH IS A POWERFULLY STRONG MORAL AGENT FOR MAKING A BOY SEE THE ERROR OF HIS WAYS
3242-67168-0037 AND IT WAS A MONTH AFTER THAT BEFORE BUD COULD GO DOWN MAIN STREET WITHOUT SOME MAN WHO HAD CALLED HIM A NOBLE LITTLE FELLOW OR A BRIGHT MANLY LITTLE CHAP WHILE HE WAS DROWNED REACHING OUT AND FETCHING HIM A CLIP ON THE EAR FOR HAVING COME BACK AND PUT THE LAUGH ON HIM
3242-67168-0038 BUT IT APPEARED THAT HE LEFT HOME TO GET A FEW INDIAN SCALPS AND THAT HE CAME BACK FOR A LITTLE BACON AND CORN PONE I SIMPLY MENTION THE WIDOW IN PASSING AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE FACT THAT THE TIME TO DO YOUR WORRYING IS WHEN A THING IS ALL OVER AND THAT THE WAY TO DO IT IS TO LEAVE IT TO THE NEIGHBORS
3242-67168-0039 I SAIL FOR HOME TO MORROW
3242-8112-0000 MANTELISH EXCUSED HIMSELF AND WENT OFF WITH THE MESSENGER THE DOOR CLOSED QUILLAN CAME BACK TO HIS CHAIR WE'RE MOVING THE OUTFIT LATER TONIGHT THE COMMISSIONER EXPLAINED
3242-8112-0001 EIGHT TONS OF HIS LAB EQUIPMENT PLUS HIS SPECIAL U LEAGUE GUARDS OH TRIGGER PICKED UP THE PUYA GLASS SHE LOOKED INTO IT IT WAS EMPTY MOVING WHERE SHE ASKED MANON SAID THE COMMISSIONER TELL YOU ABOUT THAT LATER
3242-8112-0002 EVERY LAST MUSCLE IN TRIGGER'S BODY SEEMED TO GO LIMP SIMULTANEOUSLY SHE SETTLED BACK SLIGHTLY IN THE CHAIR SURPRISED BY THE FORCE OF THE REACTION SHE HADN'T REALIZED BY NOW HOW KEYED UP SHE WAS SHE SIGHED A SMALL SIGH
3242-8112-0003 THEN SHE SMILED AT QUILLAN MAJOR SHE SAID HOW ABOUT A TINY LITTLE REFILL ON THAT PUYA ABOUT HALF QUILLAN TOOK CARE OF THE TINY LITTLE REFILL COMMISSIONER TATE SAID BY THE WAY
3242-8112-0004 QUILLAN DOES HAVE A DEGREE IN SUBSPACE ENGINEERING AND GETS ASSIGNED TO THE ENGINEERS NOW AND THEN BUT HIS REAL JOB'S SPACE SCOUT INTELLIGENCE TRIGGER NODDED I'D ALMOST GUESSED IT SHE GAVE QUILLAN ANOTHER SMILE
3242-8112-0005 AND NOW SAID THE COMMISSIONER WE'LL TALK MORE FREELY WE TELL MANTELISH JUST AS LITTLE AS WE CAN TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH TRIGGER THE PROFESSOR IS A TERRIBLE HANDICAP ON AN OPERATION LIKE THIS I UNDERSTAND HE WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF YOUR FATHER'S YES SHE SAID
3242-8112-0006 GOING OVER FOR VISITS TO MANTELISH'S GARDEN WITH MY FATHER IS ONE OF THE EARLIEST THINGS I REMEMBER I CAN IMAGINE HE'S A PROBLEM SHE SHIFTED HER GAZE CURIOUSLY FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF THE TWO MEN WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING
3242-8112-0007 LOOKING FOR GESS FAYLE AND THE KEY UNIT HOLATI TATE SAID THAT'S ABOUT IT WE'RE ONE OF A FEW THOUSAND FEDERATION GROUPS ASSIGNED TO THE SAME GENERAL JOB EACH GROUP WORKS AT ITS SPECIALTIES AND THE INFORMATION GETS CORRELATED
3242-8112-0008 IN WHAT WAY TRIGGER ASKED WELL SUPPOSE THAT KEY UNIT IS LOST AND STAYS LOST SUPPOSE ALL THE OTHER PLASMOIDS PUT TOGETHER DON'T CONTAIN ENOUGH INFORMATION TO SHOW HOW THE OLD GALACTICS PRODUCED THE THINGS AND GOT THEM TO OPERATE
3242-8112-0009 SOMEBODY WOULD GET THAT WORKED OUT PRETTY SOON WOULDN'T THEY
3242-8112-0010 THERE SEEM TO BE TOO MANY BASIC FACTORS MISSING IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO DEVELOP A WHOLE NEW CLASS OF SCIENCES FIRST AND THAT COULD TAKE A FEW CENTURIES WELL TRIGGER ADMITTED I COULD GET ALONG WITHOUT THE THINGS INDEFINITELY
3242-8112-0011 SAME HERE THE PLASMOID NABOB AGREED UNGRATEFULLY WEIRD BEASTIES BUT LET'S SEE AT PRESENT THERE ARE TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT MEMBER WORLDS TO THE FEDERATION AREN'T THERE MORE OR LESS
3242-8112-0012 AND THE NUMBER OF PLANETARY CONFEDERACIES SUBPLANETARY GOVERNMENTS INDUSTRIAL FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL COMBINES ASSORTED POWER GROUPS ET CETERA AND SO ON IS SOMETHING I'D HATE TO HAVE TO CALCULATE WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT SHE ASKED
3242-8112-0013 THEY'VE ALL BEEN TOLD WE'RE HEADING FOR A NEW GOLDEN AGE COURTESY OF THE PLASMOID SCIENCE PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY HAS BELIEVED IT NOW THERE'S CONSIDERABLE DOUBT
3242-8112-0014 OF COURSE PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY IS GOING TO GET VERY UNHAPPY EH THAT SAID COMMISSIONER TATE IS ONLY A LITTLE OF IT YES THE THING ISN'T JUST LOST SOMEBODY'S GOT IT VERY LIKELY TRIGGER NODDED
3242-8112-0015 SO ANY ONE OF UMPTEEN THOUSANDS OF ORGANIZATIONS IN THE HUB MIGHT BE THE ONE THAT HAS THAT PLASMOID NOW INCLUDING SAID HOLATI ANY ONE OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN RESTRICTED WORLDS
3242-8112-0016 THEIR TREATIES OF LIMITATION WOULDN'T HAVE LET THEM GET INTO THE PLASMOID PIE UNTIL THE OTHERS HAD BEEN AT IT A DECADE OR SO THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE EAGER THERE WAS A LITTLE PAUSE THEN TRIGGER SAID LORDY
3242-8112-0017 THE THING COULD EVEN SET OFF ANOTHER STRING OF WARS THAT'S A POINT THE COUNCIL IS NERVOUS ABOUT HE SAID WELL IT CERTAINLY IS A MESS YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE FEDERATION MIGHT HAVE HAD A SECURITY CHIEF IN ON THAT FIRST OPERATION
3242-8112-0018 RIGHT THERE ON HARVEST MOON THEY DID HE SAID IT WAS FAYLE
3242-8112-0019 HOLATI COULD THOSE THINGS EVER BECOME AS VALUABLE AS PEOPLE KEEP SAYING IT'S ALL SOUNDED A LITTLE EXAGGERATED TO ME THE COMMISSIONER SAID HE'D WONDERED ABOUT IT TOO
3242-8112-0020 I'M NOT ENOUGH OF A BIOLOGIST TO MAKE AN EDUCATED GUESS WHAT IT SEEMS TO BOIL DOWN TO IS THAT THEY MIGHT WHICH WOULD BE ENOUGH TO TEMPT A LOT OF PEOPLE TO GAMBLE VERY HIGH FOR A CHANCE TO GET CONTROL OF THE PLASMOID PROCESS
3242-8112-0021 AND WE KNOW DEFINITELY THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE GAMBLING FOR IT HOW DO YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING A COUPLE OF LEADS HERE PRETTY SHORT LEADS SO FAR BUT YOU WORK WITH WHAT YOU CAN GET HE NODDED AT THE TABLE
3242-8112-0022 TRIGGER GLANCED DOWN THE PLASMOID LAY THERE SOME INCHES FROM THE SIDE OF HER HAND YOU KNOW SHE SAID UNCOMFORTABLY OLD REPULSIVE MOVED AGAIN WHILE WE WERE TALKING TOWARDS MY HAND SHE DREW THE HAND AWAY
3242-8112-0023 I WAS WATCHING IT MAJOR QUILLAN SAID REASSURINGLY FROM THE END OF THE TABLE
3242-8112-0024 MANTELISH BROUGHT IT BACK TO MACCADON WITH HIM
3242-8112-0025 HE WAS CURIOUS BECAUSE HE COULDN'T EVEN GUESS AT WHAT ITS FUNCTION WAS IT WAS JUST LYING THERE IN A CUBICLE SO HE DID CONSIDERABLE EXPERIMENTING WITH IT WHILE HE WAITED FOR GESS FAYLE TO SHOW UP
3242-8112-0026 AND LEAGUE HEADQUARTERS FIDGETED AROUND HOPING TO GET THE KIND OF REPORT FROM MANTELISH AND FAYLE THAT MANTELISH THOUGHT THEY'D ALREADY RECEIVED THEY WERE WONDERING WHERE FAYLE WAS TOO BUT THEY KNEW FAYLE WAS SECURITY SO THEY DIDN'T LIKE TO GET TOO NOSY
3242-8112-0027 TRIGGER SHOOK HER HEAD WONDERFUL SO
3242-8112-0028 MANTELISH BEGAN TO GET RESULTS WITH IT THE COMMISSIONER SAID ONE EXPERIMENT WAS RATHER STARTLING HE'D BEEN TRYING THAT ELECTRICAL STIMULATION BUSINESS NOTHING HAPPENED UNTIL HE HAD FINISHED THEN HE TOUCHED THE PLASMOID AND IT FED THE WHOLE CHARGE BACK TO HIM
3242-8112-0029 SHE LAUGHED DELIGHTEDLY GOOD FOR REPULSIVE STOOD UP FOR HIS RIGHTS EH MANTELISH GAINED SOME SUCH IMPRESSION ANYWAY HE BECAME MORE CAUTIOUS WITH IT AFTER THAT AND THEN HE LEARNED SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE IMPORTANT
3242-8112-0030 HE WAS VISITING ANOTHER LAB WHERE THEY HAD A COUPLE OF PLASMOIDS WHICH ACTUALLY MOVED NOW AND THEN
3242-8112-0031 THE TWO LAB PLASMOIDS STOPPED MOVING WHILE HE WAS THERE THEY HAVEN'T MOVED SINCE
3242-8112-0032 RIGHT HE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AND THEN LOCATED ANOTHER MOVING PLASMOID
3242-8112-0033 THE BIG ONE INDUCES PLASMOID ACTIVITY THE LITTLE ONE MODIFIES IT
3242-8112-0034 BUT HIS TWO LAB GUARDS AND ONE OF THE RAIDERS WERE KILLED THE OTHERS GOT AWAY GESS FAYLE'S DEFECTION WAS A CERTAINTY BY THEN AND EVERYBODY WAS VERY NERVOUS THE FEDS GOT THERE FAST AND DEAD BRAINED THE RAIDER THEY LEARNED JUST TWO THINGS
3242-8112-0035 ONE HE'D BEEN MIND BLOCKED AND COULDN'T HAVE SPILLED ANY SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION EVEN IF THEY HAD GOT HIM ALIVE THE OTHER ITEM THEY DREW FROM HIS BRAIN WAS A CLEAR IMPRESSION OF THE TARGET OF THE RAID THE PROFESSOR'S PAL HERE UH HUH TRIGGER SAID LOST IN THOUGHT
3242-8112-0036 SHE POKED REPULSIVE LIGHTLY THAT WOULD BE FAYLE AND HIS ASSOCIATES THEN OR SOMEBODY WHO KNEW ABOUT THEM DID THEY WANT TO KILL IT OR GRAB IT THE COMMISSIONER LOOKED AT HER GRAB IT WAS THE DEAD BRAIN REPORT WHY
3242-8112-0037 SO THEY NEED IT IN CONNECTION WITH THE KEY UNIT TRIGGER ASKED PROBABLY THAT MAKES EVERYTHING LOOK VERY MUCH BETTER DOESN'T IT QUITE A LITTLE HE SAID THE UNIT MAY NOT WORK
3242-8112-0038 MANTELISH TALKS OF SOMETHING HE CALLS PROXIMITY INFLUENCE
3242-8112-0039 SO TRIGGER SAID THEY MIGHT HAVE TWO THIRDS OF WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ONE THIRD RIGHT HERE ON THE TABLE HOW MANY OF THE LATER RAIDERS DID YOU CATCH ALL OF THEM SAID THE COMMISSIONER AROUND FORTY
3242-8112-0040 WE GOT THEM DEAD WE GOT THEM ALIVE IT DIDN'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE THEY WERE HIRED HANDS VERY EXPENSIVE HIRED HANDS BUT STILL JUST THAT MOST OF THEM DIDN'T KNOW A THING WE COULD USE THE ONES THAT DID KNOW SOMETHING WERE MIND BLOCKED AGAIN
3242-8112-0041 I THOUGHT TRIGGER SAID REFLECTIVELY YOU COULD UN BLOCK SOMEONE LIKE THAT YOU CAN SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE VERY GOOD AT IT AND IF YOU HAVE TIME ENOUGH WE COULDN'T AFFORD TO WAIT A YEAR THEY DIED BEFORE THEY COULD TELL US ANYTHING
3242-8112-0042 THERE WAS A PAUSE THEN TRIGGER ASKED HOW DID YOU GET INVOLVED IN THIS PERSONALLY MORE OR LESS BY ACCIDENT THE COMMISSIONER SAID IT WAS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR SECOND LEAD THAT'S ME HUH SHE SAID UNHAPPILY YES
3242-8112-0043 WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO GRAB ME I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WE HAVEN'T FOUND OUT YET WE'RE HOPING WE WILL IN A VERY FEW DAYS IS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN'T TELL ME ABOUT
3242-8112-0044 I CAN TELL YOU MOST OF WHAT I KNOW AT THE MOMENT SAID THE COMMISSIONER
3259-158083-0000 ADMINISTRATION TERRORISM THE ADMINISTRATION TRIED IN ANOTHER WAY TO STOP PICKETING
3259-158083-0001 THE AGITATION WOULD CERTAINLY WEAKEN SO THOUGHT THE ADMINISTRATION TO THEIR GREAT SURPRISE HOWEVER IN THE FACE OF THAT RECKLESS AND EXTREME SENTENCE THE LONGEST PICKET LINE OF THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN FORMED AT THE WHITE HOUSE IN THE LATE AFTERNOON OF NOVEMBER TENTH
3259-158083-0002 FORTY ONE WOMEN PICKETED IN PROTEST AGAINST THIS WANTON PERSECUTION OF THEIR LEADER AS WELL AS AGAINST THE DELAY IN PASSING THE AMENDMENT FACE TO FACE WITH AN EMBARRASSING NUMBER OF PRISONERS THE ADMINISTRATION USED ITS WITS AND DECIDED
3259-158083-0003 TO REDUCE THE NUMBER TO A MANAGEABLE SIZE BEFORE IMPRISONING THIS GROUP FAILING OF THAT THEY TRIED STILL ANOTHER WAY OUT THEY RESORTED TO IMPRISONMENT WITH TERRORISM
3259-158083-0004 IN ORDER TO SHOW HOW WIDELY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NATION THIS GROUP OF PICKETS WAS I GIVE ITS PERSONNEL COMPLETE FIRST GROUP NEW YORK MISSUS JOHN WINTERS BRANNAN MISS BELLE SHEINBERG

3259-158083-0014 AS SHE SAID IN COURT WE TOOK THIS ACTION WITH GREAT CONSECRATION OF SPIRIT WITH WILLINGNESS TO SACRIFICE PERSONAL LIBERTY
3259-158083-0015 JUDGE MULLOWNY ADDRESSED THE PRISONERS WITH MANY HIGH SOUNDING WORDS ABOUT THE SERIOUSNESS OF OBSTRUCTING THE TRAFFIC IN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL AND INADVERTENTLY SLIPPED INTO A DISCOURSE ON RUSSIA AND THE DANGERS OF REVOLUTION
3259-158083-0016 BUT THEIR MINDS WERE TOO FULL OF THE POLITICAL ASPECT OF OUR OFFENSE TO CONCEAL IT THE TRUTH OF THE SITUATION IS THAT THE COURT HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN POWER TO MEET IT THE JUDGE LAMENTED IT IS VERY VERY PUZZLING I FIND YOU GUILTY OF THE OFFENSE CHARGED
3259-158083-0017 BUT WILL TAKE THE MATTER OF SENTENCE UNDER ADVISEMENT AND SO THE GUILTY PICKETS WERE SUMMARILY RELEASED THE ADMINISTRATION DID NOT RELISH THE INCARCERATION OF FORTY ONE WOMEN FOR ANOTHER REASON THAN LIMITED HOUSING ACCOMMODATIONS
3259-158083-0018 FORTY ONE WOMEN REPRESENTING SIXTEEN STATES IN THE UNION MIGHT CREATE A CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL DISLOCATION BUT THESE SAME FORTY ONE WOMEN WERE DETERMINED TO FORCE THE ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE ITS CHOICE IT COULD ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE THEIR PEACEFUL AGITATION
3259-158083-0019 OR IT COULD STAND THE REACTION WHICH WAS BOUND TO COME FROM IMPRISONING THEM AND SO THE FORTY ONE WOMEN RETURNED TO THE WHITE HOUSE GATES TO RESUME THEIR PICKETING THEY STOOD GUARD SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE THE POLICE TAKEN UNAWARES COULD SUMMON SUFFICIENT FORCE TO ARREST THEM
3259-158083-0020 COME BACK ON FRIDAY I AM NOT YET PREPARED TO TRY THE CASE LOGIC DICTATED THAT EITHER WE HAD A RIGHT TO STAND AT THE GATES WITH OUR BANNERS OR WE DID NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT
3259-158083-0021 IT HAD TO STOP PICKETING WHETHER THIS WAS DONE LEGALLY OR ILLEGALLY LOGICALLY OR ILLOGICALLY CLUMSILY OR DEXTEROUSLY WAS OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE PICKETING MUST BE STOPPED
3259-158083-0022 USING THEIR WELCOME RELEASE TO CONTINUE THEIR PROTEST THE WOMEN AGAIN MARCHED WITH THEIR BANNERS TO THE WHITE HOUSE IN AN ATTEMPT TO PICKET AGAIN THEY WERE ARRESTED NO ONE WHO SAW THAT LINE WILL EVER FORGET THE IMPRESSION IT MADE NOT ONLY ON FRIENDS OF THE SUFFRAGISTS
3259-158083-0023 BUT ON THE GENERAL POPULACE OF WASHINGTON TO SEE THESE WOMEN FORCE WITH SUCH MAGNIFICENT DEFIANCE THE HAND OF A WAVERING ADMINISTRATION ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING
3259-158083-0024 MISS BURNS RECEIVED SIX MONTHS IN PRONOUNCING THE LIGHTEST SENTENCE UPON MISSUS NOLAN THE JUDGE SAID THAT HE DID SO ON ACCOUNT OF HER AGE HE URGED HER HOWEVER TO PAY HER FINE HINTING THAT JAIL MIGHT BE TOO SEVERE ON HER AND MIGHT BRING ON DEATH
3259-158083-0025 AT THIS SUGGESTION TINY MISSUS NOLAN PULLED HERSELF UP ON HER TOES AND SAID WITH GREAT DIGNITY
3259-158083-0026 I HAVE A NEPHEW FIGHTING FOR DEMOCRACY IN FRANCE
3259-158083-0027 I SHOULD BE ASHAMED IF I DID NOT JOIN THESE BRAVE WOMEN IN THEIR FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA I SHOULD BE PROUD OF THE HONOR TO DIE IN PRISON
3259-158083-0028 FOR THE LIBERTY OF AMERICAN WOMEN
3259-158083-0029 OR DO PRISON LABOR ANY WORDS OF MINE WOULD BE INADEQUATE TO TELL THE STORY OF THE PRISONERS RECEPTION AT THE OCCOQUAN WORKHOUSE THE FOLLOWING IS THE STATEMENT OF MISSUS NOLAN DICTATED UPON HER RELEASE IN THE PRESENCE OF MISTER DUDLEY FIELD MALONE
3259-158083-0030 MISSUS HERNDON WAS STANDING BEHIND A DESK WHEN WE WERE BROUGHT INTO THIS OFFICE AND THERE WERE FIVE OR SIX MEN ALSO IN THE ROOM
3259-158083-0031 SAID SHE MUST SPEAK TO WHITTAKER THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE PLACE
3259-158083-0032 MISSUS HERNDON CALLED MY NAME BUT I DID NOT ANSWER
3259-158083-0033 AS THEY RAN ME PAST SHE WAS LYING THERE WITH HER ARMS OUT AND WE HEARD ONE OF THE MEN YELL THE SUFFRAGER MY MOTHER AIN'T NO SUFFRAGER I'LL PUT YOU THROUGH AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR
3259-158083-0034 THEY PUSHED ME THROUGH A DOOR THEN I LOST MY BALANCE AND FELL AGAINST THE IRON BED MISSUS COSU STRUCK THE WALL THEN THEY THREW IN TWO MATS AND TWO DIRTY BLANKETS
3259-158083-0035 THE DOOR WAS BARRED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
3259-158083-0036 MISSUS COSU WOULD NOT LET ME LIE ON THE FLOOR SHE PUT ME ON THE COUCH AND STRETCHED OUT ON THE FLOOR ON ONE OF THE TWO PADS THEY THREW IN
3259-158083-0037 WHEN MISSUS LEWIS DOUBLED OVER AND HANDLED LIKE A SACK OF SOMETHING

3259-158083-0052 HE BROUGHT NEWS THAT UNKNOWN TORTURES WERE GOING ON MISTER O'BRIEN IMMEDIATELY FORCED HIS WAY THROUGH BY A COURT ORDER

3259-158083-0055 SMUGGLED OUT OF THE WORKHOUSE MISS BURNS IS SO GIFTED A WRITER THAT I FEEL APOLOGETIC FOR USING THESE SCRAPS IN THEIR RAW FORM BUT I KNOW SHE WILL FORGIVE ME WEDNESDAY

3259-158083-0074 EACH ONE WAS CALLED TO THE MAT AND INTERROGATED WILL YOU WORK WILL YOU PUT ON PRISON CLOTHES WILL YOU EAT WILL YOU STOP PICKETING WILL YOU GO WITHOUT PAYING YOUR FINE AND PROMISE NEVER TO PICKET AGAIN
3259-158083-0075 HOW BAFFLED HE MUST HAVE BEEN THE ANSWER WAS DEFINITE AND FINAL THEIR RESISTANCE WAS SUPERB ONE OF THE FEW WARNING INCIDENTS DURING THE GRAY DAYS OF OUR IMPRISONMENT
3259-158083-0076 WAS THE UNEXPECTED SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING OF ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT DOCTORS
3259-158083-0077 I HAVE SEEN WOMEN IN RUSSIA UNDERGO EXTREME SUFFERING FOR THEIR IDEALS BUT UNLESS I HAD SEEN THIS WITH MY OWN EYES
3259-158083-0078 MY SISTER HUNGER STRUCK IN RUSSIA WHERE SHE WAS IMPRISONED FOR REFUSING TO REVEAL THE WHEREABOUTS OF TWO OF HER FRIENDS INDICTED FOR A GOVERNMENT OFFENSE SHE WAS FED AFTER THREE DAYS
3259-158083-0079 YOU GIRLS ARE ON YOUR NINTH DAY OF HUNGER STRIKE AND YOUR CONDITION IS CRITICAL IT IS A GREAT PITY THAT SUCH WOMEN SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO THIS TREATMENT I HOPE THAT YOU WILL CARRY YOUR POINT
3259-158083-0080 AND FORCE THE HAND OF THE GOVERNMENT
3259-158083-0081 TO BE ALLOWED TO SEE THE PRESIDENT AND ASK FOR A SPECIAL ORDER TO VISIT HER DAUGHTER FAILING TO SECURE THIS SHE WENT DAILY TO MISTER TUMULTY'S OFFICE ASKING IF HE HIMSELF WOULD NOT INTERCEDE FOR HER
3259-158083-0082 THE STORIES OF THE INHUMAN TREATMENT AT OCCOQUAN WERE FALSE AND THAT SHE MUST NOT BELIEVE THEM FINALLY MISSUS YOUNG PLEADED TO BE ALLOWED TO SEND ADDITIONAL WARM CLOTHING TO HER DAUGHTER WHOM SHE KNEW TO BE TOO LIGHTLY CLAD FOR THE VIGOROUS TEMPERATURE OF NOVEMBER
3259-158083-0083 MISTER TUMULTY ASSURED HER THAT THE WOMEN WERE PROPERLY CLOTHED AND REFUSED TO PERMIT THE CLOTHING TO BE SENT THE SUBSEQUENT STORIES OF THE WOMEN SHOWED WHAT AGONIES THEY HAD ENDURED BECAUSE THEY WERE INADEQUATELY CLAD FROM THE DAMPNESS OF THE CELLS INTO WHICH THEY WERE THROWN
3259-158083-0084 MISSUS JOHN WINTERS BRANNAN WAS AMONG THE WOMEN WHO ENDURED THE NIGHT OF TERROR MISSUS BRANNAN IS THE DAUGHTER OF CHARLES A DANA FOUNDER OF THE NEW YORK SUN AND THAT GREAT AMERICAN PATRIOT OF LIBERTY WHO WAS A TRUSTED ASSOCIATE AND COUNSELOR
3259-158083-0085 OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN MISSUS BRANNAN LIFE LONG SUFFRAGIST IS AN ARISTOCRAT OF INTELLECT AND FEELING WHO HAS ALWAYS ALLIED HERSELF WITH LIBERTARIAN MOVEMENTS THIS WAS HER SECOND TERM OF IMPRISONMENT
3259-158083-0086 SHE WROTE A COMPREHENSIVE AFFIDAVIT OF HER EXPERIENCE AFTER NARRATING THE EVENTS WHICH LED UP TO THE ATTACK SHE CONTINUES SUPERINTENDENT WHITTAKER THEN SHOUTED OUT IN A LOUD TONE OF VOICE
3259-158083-0087 SEIZE THESE WOMEN TAKE THEM OFF THAT ONE THAT ONE TAKE HER OFF THE GUARDS RUSHED FORWARD AND AN ALMOST INDESCRIBABLE SCENE OF VIOLENT CONFUSION ENSUED I SAW ONE OF THE GUARDS SEIZE HER LUCY BURNS
3259-158083-0088 BY THE ARMS TWIST OR FORCE THEM BACK OF HER
3259-158083-0089 AND PUT IT ON IN ORDER TO PREPARE MYSELF IF ATTACKED I WAS TREMBLING AT THE TIME AND WAS STUNNED WITH TERROR AT THE SITUATION AS IT HAD DEVELOPED AND SAID TO THE SUPERINTENDENT I WILL GIVE MY NAME UNDER PROTEST AND STARTED TO WALK TOWARDS THE DESK WHEREON LAY THE BOOKS THE SUPERINTENDENT SHOUTED TO ME
3259-158083-0090 I SAW THE GUARDS SEIZING THE DIFFERENT WOMEN OF THE PARTY WITH THE UTMOST VIOLENCE THE FURNITURE BEING OVERTURNED AND THE ROOM A SCENE OF THE UTMOST DISTURBANCE
3259-158083-0091 I SAW MISS LINCOLN LYING ON THE FLOOR WITH EVERY APPEARANCE OF HAVING JUST BEEN THROWN DOWN BY THE TWO GUARDS WHO WERE STANDING OVER HER IN A MENACING ATTITUDE SEEING THE GENERAL DISTURBANCE
3259-158083-0092 I GAVE UP ALL IDEA OF GIVING MY NAME AT THE DESK AND INSTINCTIVELY JOINED MY COMPANIONS TO GO WITH THEM AND SHARE WHATEVER WAS IN STORE FOR THEM THE WHOLE GROUP OF WOMEN WERE THROWN DRAGGED OR HERDED OUT OF THE OFFICE ON TO THE PORCH DOWN THE STEPS TO THE GROUND AND FORCED TO CROSS THE ROAD
3259-158083-0093 TO THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING DURING ALL OF THIS TIME SUPERINTENDENT WHITTAKER WAS DIRECTING THE WHOLE ATTACK ALL OF US WERE THROWN INTO DIFFERENT CELLS IN THE MEN'S PRISON I BEING PUT IN ONE WITH FOUR OTHER WOMEN THE CELL CONTAINING A NARROW BED
3259-158083-0094 AND ONE CHAIR WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY REMOVED DURING THE TIME THAT WE WERE BEING FORCED INTO THE CELLS THE GUARDS KEPT UP AN UPROAR SHOUTING BANGING THE IRON DOORS CLANGING BARS MAKING A TERRIFYING NOISE
3259-158083-0095 I AND ONE OF MY COMPANIONS WERE LYING DOWN ON THE NARROW BED ON WHICH WERE A BLANKET AND ONE PILLOW THE DOOR OF THE CELL WAS OPENED AND A MATTRESS AND A BLANKET BEING THROWN IN THE DOOR WAS VIOLENTLY BANGED TO
3259-158083-0096 AND LAY DOWN COVERING THEMSELVES WITH THE BLANKET I LOOKED ACROSS THE CORRIDOR AND SAW MISS LINCOLN AND ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WAS ALL RIGHT BEING ANXIOUS TO KNOW WHETHER SHE HAD BEEN HURT BY THE TREATMENT IN THE OFFICE BUILDING INSTANTLY SUPERINTENDENT WHITTAKER RUSHED FORWARD SHOUTING AT ME
3259-158083-0097 GAG YOU AND PUT YOU IN A STRAITJACKET I WISH TO STATE AGAIN THAT THE CELLS INTO WHICH WE WERE PUT WERE SITUATED IN THE MEN'S PRISON
3259-158083-0098 AND WHO COULD AT ANY MOMENT LOOK AT US FURTHERMORE THE WATER CLOSETS WERE IN FULL VIEW OF THE CORRIDOR WHERE SUPERINTENDENT WHITTAKER AND THE GUARDS WERE MOVING ABOUT THE FLUSHING OF THESE CLOSETS COULD ONLY BE DONE FROM THE CORRIDOR AND WE WERE FORCED TO ASK THE GUARDS TO DO THIS FOR US
3259-158083-0099 THE MEN WHO HAD SHORTLY BEFORE ATTACKED US
3259-158083-0100 I WAS EXHAUSTED BY WHAT I HAD SEEN AND BEEN THROUGH AND SPENT THE NIGHT IN ABSOLUTE TERROR OF FURTHER ATTACK AND OF WHAT MIGHT STILL BE IN STORE FOR US I THOUGHT OF THE YOUNG GIRLS WHO WERE WITH US AND FEARED FOR THEIR SAFETY THE GUARDS ACTED BRUTAL IN THE EXTREME
3259-158083-0101 INCITED TO THEIR BRUTAL CONDUCT TOWARDS US BY THE SUPERINTENDENT I THOUGHT OF THE OFFENSE WITH WHICH WE HAD BEEN CHARGED MERELY THAT OF OBSTRUCTING TRAFFIC AND FELT THAT THE TREATMENT THAT WE HAD RECEIVED WAS OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO THE OFFENSE WITH WHICH WE WERE CHARGED
3259-158083-0102 AND THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT THE MATRON AND GUARDS WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO ACT TOWARDS US AS THEY HAD ACTED UNLESS THEY RELIED UPON THE SUPPORT OF HIGHER AUTHORITIES IT SEEMED TO ME THAT EVERYTHING HAD BEEN DONE FROM THE TIME WE REACHED THE WORKHOUSE TO TERRORIZE US AND MY FEAR
3259-158083-0103 LEST THE EXTREME OF OUTRAGE WOULD BE WORKED UPON THE YOUNG GIRLS OF OUR PARTY BECAME INTENSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO DESCRIBE THE TERROR OF THAT NIGHT
3259-158083-0104 THE AFFIDAVIT THEN CONTINUES WITH THE STORY OF HOW MISSUS BRANNAN WAS COMPELLED THE FOLLOWING MORNING TO PUT ON PRISON CLOTHES WAS GIVEN A CUP OF SKIMMED MILK AND A SLICE OF TOAST
3259-158083-0105 AND REQUESTED PERMISSION TO LIE DOWN FEELING SO ILL I COULD NOT SLEEP HAVING A SENSE OF CONSTANT DANGER I WAS ALMOST PARALYZED AND IN WRETCHED PHYSICAL CONDITION
3259-158083-0106 SEVEN OF US BEING IN THE PARTY WE WERE SO EXHAUSTED AND WEARY THAT WE WERE OBLIGED TO STOP CONSTANTLY TO REST ON OUR WAY BACK FROM THE WALK WE HEARD THE BAYING OF HOUNDS VERY NEAR US IN THE WOODS THE MATRON SAID
3259-158083-0107 ONE OF THE PARTY MISS FINDEISEN ASKED WHETHER THEY WOULD ATTACK US TO WHICH THE MATRON REPLIED THAT IS JUST WHAT THEY WOULD DO AND HURRIED US ALONG THE BAYING GREW LOUDER AND NEARER AT TIMES AND THEN MORE DISTANT AS THE DOGS RUSHED BACK AND FORTH
3259-158083-0108 AND THIS WENT ON UNTIL WE REACHED THE SEWING ROOM THE EFFECT OF THIS UPON OUR NERVES CAN BETTER BE IMAGINED THAN DESCRIBED EVERY CONCEIVABLE LIE WAS TRIED IN AN EFFORT TO FORCE THE WOMEN TO ABANDON THEIR VARIOUS FORM OF RESISTANCE
3259-158083-0109 THEY WERE TOLD THAT NO EFFORTS WERE BEING MADE FROM THE OUTSIDE TO REACH THEM AND THAT THEIR ATTORNEY HAD BEEN CALLED OFF THE CASE EACH ONE WAS TOLD THAT SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE HUNGER STRIKING EACH ONE WAS TOLD THAT ALL THE OTHERS HAD PUT ON PRISON CLOTHES AND WERE WORKING
3259-158083-0110 ALTHOUGH THEY WERE SEPARATED FROM ONE ANOTHER THEY SUSPECTED THE LIES AND REMAINED STRONG IN THEIR RESISTANCE AFTER MISTER O'BRIEN'S ONE VISIT AND THE SUBSEQUENT REPORTS IN THE PRESS HE WAS THEREAFTER REFUSED ADMISSION TO THE WORKHOUSE
3259-158083-0111 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS ANXIOUS TO KEEP THIS GROUP AWAY FROM ALICE PAUL AND HER COMPANIONS AS THEY COUNTED ON HANDLING THE REBELLION MORE EASILY IN TWO GROUPS THAN ONE MEANWHILE THE CONDITION OF THE PRISONERS IN THE WORKHOUSE GREW STEADILY WORSE
3259-158083-0112 WE DECIDED TO TAKE THE ONLY COURSE OPEN TO OBTAIN A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS A HURRIED JOURNEY BY COUNSEL TO UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE WADDILL OF NORFOLK VIRGINIA BROUGHT THE WRIT
3259-158083-0113 IT COMPELLED THE GOVERNMENT TO BRING THE PRISONERS INTO COURT AND SHOW CAUSE WHY THEY SHOULD NOT BE RETURNED TO THE DISTRICT JAIL THIS CONSERVATIVE SOUTHERN JUDGE SAID OF THE PETITION FOR THE WRIT
3259-158083-0114 THERE FOLLOWED A WEEK MORE MELODRAMATIC THAN THE MOST STIRRING MOVING PICTURE FILM ALTHOUGH THE WRIT HAD BEEN APPLIED FOR IN THE GREATEST SECRECY
3259-158083-0115 A DETECTIVE SUDDENLY APPEARED TO ACCOMPANY MISTER O'BRIEN FROM WASHINGTON TO NORFOLK DURING HIS STAY IN NORFOLK AND BACK TO WASHINGTON TELEPHONE WIRES AT OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE TAPPED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS COGNIZANT OF EVERY MOVE IN THIS PROCEDURE BEFORE IT WAS EXECUTED
3259-158083-0116 NO SOONER WAS OUR PLAN DECIDED UPON THAN FRIENDS OF THE ADMINISTRATION BESOUGHT US TO ABANDON THE HABEAS CORPUS PROCEEDINGS ONE MEMBER OF THE ADMINISTRATION SENT AN EMISSARY TO OUR HEADQUARTERS WITH THE FOLLOWING APPEAL
3259-158083-0117 IF YOU WILL ONLY DROP THESE PROCEEDINGS I CAN ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE YOU THAT THE PRISONERS WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE WORKHOUSE TO THE JAIL IN A WEEK IN A WEEK THEY MAY BE DEAD BY THAT TIME WE ANSWERED WE CANNOT WAIT
3259-158083-0118 AND BEFORE THE END OF THE WEEK THEY HOPED TO INCREASE THEIR FACILITIES FOR FORCIBLE FEEDING AT THE WORKHOUSE THEY ALSO WISHED TO CONCEAL THE TREATMENT OF THE WOMEN THE EXPOSURE OF WHICH WOULD BE INEVITABLE IN ANY COURT PROCEEDINGS AND LASTLY
3259-158083-0119 THE ADMINISTRATION WAS ANXIOUS TO AVOID OPENING UP THE WHOLE QUESTION OF THE LEGALITY OF THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE WORKHOUSE IN VIRGINIA PERSONS CONVICTED IN THE DISTRICT FOR ACTS COMMITTED IN VIOLATION OF DISTRICT LAW WERE TRANSPORTED TO VIRGINIA ALIEN TERRITORY TO SERVE THEIR TERMS
3259-158083-0120 IT WAS A MOOT POINT WHETHER PRISONERS WERE SO TREATED WITH SUFFICIENT WARRANT IN LAW EMINENT JURISTS HELD THAT THE DISTRICT HAD NO RIGHT TO CONVICT A PERSON UNDER ITS LAWS AND COMMIT THAT PERSON TO CONFINEMENT IN ANOTHER STATE THEY CONTENDED THAT SENTENCE IMPOSED UPON A PERSON FOR UNLAWFUL ACTS IN THE DISTRICT
3259-158083-0121 SHOULD BE EXECUTED IN THE DISTRICT HUNDREDS OF PERSONS WHO HAD BEEN CONVICTED IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND WHO HAD SERVED THEIR SENTENCES IN VIRGINIA HAD BEEN WITHOUT MONEY OR INFLUENCE ENOUGH TO CONTEST THIS DOUBTFUL PROCEDURE IN THE COURTS THE ADMINISTRATION
3259-158083-0122 WAS ALARMED WE QUICKENED OUR PACE A MEMBER OF THE ADMINISTRATION RUSHED HIS ATTORNEY AS COURIER TO THE WOMEN IN THE WORKHOUSE TO IMPLORE THEM NOT TO CONSENT TO THE HABEAS CORPUS PROCEEDINGS HE WAS EASILY ADMITTED AND TRIED TO EXTORT FROM ONE PRISONER AT A TIME A PROMISE TO REJECT THE PLAN
3259-158083-0123 THE WOMEN SUSPECTED HIS SOLICITUDE AND REFUSED TO MAKE ANY PROMISE WHATSOEVER WITHOUT FIRST BEING ALLOWED TO SEE THEIR OWN ATTORNEY WE BEGAN AT ONCE TO SERVE THE WRIT ORDINARILY THIS WOULD BE AN EASY THING TO DO BUT FOR US IT DEVELOPED INTO A VERY DIFFICULT TASK
3259-158083-0124 A DEPUTY MARSHAL MUST SERVE THE WRIT COUNSEL SOUGHT A DEPUTY FOR MILES AROUND WASHINGTON NOT ONE WAS TO BE FOUND AT HIS HOME OR LODGINGS NONE COULD BE REACHED BY TELEPHONE
3259-158083-0125 WHERE HE KEPT HIMSELF DISCREETLY HIDDEN FOR SEVERAL DAYS WHEN A DEPUTY WAS FOUND SIX ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO SERVE THE WRIT ALL FAILED FINALLY BY A RUSE MISTER WHITTAKER WAS CAUGHT AT HIS HOME LATE AT NIGHT
328-129766-0000 AND SO MIGHT MARRY AGAIN WHEN HE WOULD
328-129766-0001 AND TO ASSIST AND SUPPORT ME AS LONG AS I LIVED AND THAT IF HE DIED BEFORE ME HE WOULD LEAVE SUFFICIENT TO HIS MOTHER TO TAKE CARE OF ME STILL IN THE NAME OF A SISTER AND HE WAS IN SOME RESPECTS CAREFUL OF ME WHEN HE HEARD OF ME
328-129766-0002 AS YOU SHALL HEAR IN ITS TIME I CAME AWAY FOR ENGLAND IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST AFTER I HAD BEEN EIGHT YEARS IN THAT COUNTRY AND NOW A NEW SCENE OF MISFORTUNES ATTENDED ME WHICH PERHAPS FEW WOMEN HAVE GONE THROUGH THE LIFE OF
328-129766-0003 WE HAD AN INDIFFERENT GOOD VOYAGE TILL WE CAME JUST UPON THE COAST OF ENGLAND AND WHERE WE ARRIVED IN TWO AND THIRTY DAYS BUT WERE THEN RUFFLED WITH TWO OR THREE STORMS
328-129766-0004 GOT SOME REFRESHMENT ON SHORE AND PUT TO SEA AGAIN THOUGH WE MET WITH VERY BAD WEATHER AGAIN IN WHICH THE SHIP SPRUNG HER MAINMAST AS THEY CALLED IT FOR I KNEW NOT WHAT THEY MEANT BUT WE GOT AT LAST INTO MILFORD HAVEN IN WALES
328-129766-0005 WHERE THOUGH IT WAS REMOTE FROM OUR PORT
328-129766-0006 THE ISLE OF BRITAIN I RESOLVED TO VENTURE IT NO MORE UPON THE WATERS WHICH HAD BEEN SO TERRIBLE TO ME SO GETTING MY CLOTHES AND MONEY ON SHORE WITH MY BILLS OF LOADING AND OTHER PAPERS I RESOLVED TO COME FOR LONDON
328-129766-0007 THE PORT WHITHER SHE WAS BOUND WAS TO BRISTOL WHERE MY BROTHER'S CHIEF CORRESPONDENT LIVED I GOT TO LONDON IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS WHERE I HEARD A LITTLE WHILE AFTER THAT THE SHIP WAS ARRIVED IN BRISTOL
328-129766-0008 THE BREAKING OF HER MAINMAST SHE HAD GREAT DAMAGE ON BOARD AND THAT A GREAT PART OF HER CARGO WAS SPOILED I HAD NOW A NEW SCENE OF LIFE UPON MY HANDS AND A DREADFUL APPEARANCE IT HAD I WAS COME AWAY WITH A KIND OF FINAL FAREWELL
328-129766-0009 WHAT I BROUGHT WITH ME WAS INDEED CONSIDERABLE HAD IT COME SAFE AND BY THE HELP OF IT I MIGHT HAVE MARRIED AGAIN TOLERABLY WELL BUT AS IT WAS I WAS REDUCED TO BETWEEN TWO OR THREE HUNDRED POUNDS IN THE WHOLE AND THIS WITHOUT ANY HOPE OF RECRUIT
328-129766-0010 I WAS ENTIRELY WITHOUT FRIENDS NAY EVEN SO MUCH AS WITHOUT ACQUAINTANCE
328-129766-0011 THAT SET ME UP FORMERLY FOR A FORTUNE SHE WAS DEAD AND HER HUSBAND ALSO AS I WAS INFORMED UPON SENDING A PERSON UNKNOWN TO INQUIRE THE LOOKING AFTER MY CARGO OF GOODS SOON AFTER OBLIGED ME TO TAKE A JOURNEY TO BRISTOL AND DURING MY ATTENDANCE UPON THAT AFFAIR
328-129766-0012 I TOOK THE DIVERSION OF GOING TO THE BATH FOR AS I WAS STILL FAR FROM BEING OLD SO MY HUMOUR WHICH WAS ALWAYS GAY CONTINUED SO TO AN EXTREME AND BEING NOW AS IT WERE A WOMAN OF FORTUNE THOUGH I WAS A WOMAN WITHOUT A FORTUNE
328-129766-0013 AS HAD BEEN MY CASE BEFORE THE BATH IS A PLACE OF GALLANTRY ENOUGH EXPENSIVE AND FULL OF SNARES I WENT THITHER INDEED
328-129766-0014 BUT I MUST DO MYSELF JUSTICE AS TO PROTEST I KNEW NOTHING AMISS I MEANT NOTHING BUT IN AN HONEST WAY NOR HAD I ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT ME AT FIRST THAT LOOKED THE WAY WHICH AFTERWARDS I SUFFERED THEM TO BE GUIDED
328-129766-0015 AS IT IS CALLED THERE AND CONTRACTED SOME UNHAPPY ACQUAINTANCES WHICH RATHER PROMPTED THE FOLLIES I FELL AFTERWARDS INTO THAN FORTIFIED ME AGAINST THEM I LIVED PLEASANTLY ENOUGH KEPT GOOD COMPANY THAT IS TO SAY GAY FINE COMPANY
328-129766-0016 BUT HAD THE DISCOURAGEMENT TO FIND THIS WAY OF LIVING SUNK ME EXCEEDINGLY AND THAT AS I HAD NO SETTLED INCOME SO SPENDING UPON THE MAIN STOCK WAS BUT A CERTAIN KIND OF BLEEDING TO DEATH AND THIS GAVE ME MANY SAD REFLECTIONS IN THE INTERVAL OF MY OTHER THOUGHTS
328-129766-0017 HOWEVER I SHOOK THEM OFF
328-129766-0018 BUT I WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE FOR IT I WAS NOT NOW AT REDRIFF WHERE IF I HAD SET MYSELF TOLERABLY UP SOME HONEST SEA CAPTAIN OR OTHER MIGHT HAVE TALKED WITH ME UPON THE HONOURABLE TERMS OF MATRIMONY BUT I WAS AT THE BATH
328-129766-0019 WHERE MEN FIND A MISTRESS SOMETIMES BUT VERY RARELY LOOK FOR A WIFE AND CONSEQUENTLY ALL THE PARTICULAR ACQUAINTANCES A WOMAN CAN EXPECT TO MAKE THERE MUST HAVE SOME TENDENCY THAT WAY I HAD SPENT THE FIRST SEASON WELL ENOUGH
328-129766-0020 FOR THOUGH I HAD CONTRACTED SOME ACQUAINTANCE WITH A GENTLEMAN WHO CAME TO THE BATH FOR HIS DIVERSION
328-129766-0021 AS IT MIGHT BE CALLED I HAD RESISTED SOME CASUAL OFFERS OF GALLANTRY AND HAD MANAGED THAT WAY WELL ENOUGH I WAS NOT WICKED ENOUGH TO COME INTO THE CRIME FOR THE MERE VICE OF IT AND I HAD NO EXTRAORDINARY OFFERS MADE ME THAT TEMPTED ME WITH THE MAIN THING WHICH I WANTED
328-129766-0022 I CONTRACTED AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH A WOMAN IN WHOSE HOUSE I LODGED WHO THOUGH SHE DID NOT KEEP AN ILL HOUSE AS WE CALL IT YET HAD NONE OF THE BEST PRINCIPLES IN HERSELF I HAD ON ALL OCCASIONS BEHAVED MYSELF SO WELL
328-129766-0023 AS NOT TO GET THE LEAST SLUR UPON MY REPUTATION ON ANY ACCOUNT WHATEVER AND ALL THE MEN THAT I HAD CONVERSED WITH WERE OF SO GOOD REPUTATION THAT I HAD NOT GIVEN THE LEAST REFLECTION BY CONVERSING WITH THEM
328-129766-0024 FOR A WICKED CORRESPONDENCE IF THEY HAD ANY OF THEM OFFERED IT YET THERE WAS ONE GENTLEMAN AS ABOVE WHO ALWAYS SINGLED ME OUT FOR THE DIVERSION OF MY COMPANY AS HE CALLED IT WHICH AS HE WAS PLEASED TO SAY WAS VERY AGREEABLE TO HIM BUT AT THAT TIME
328-129766-0025 THERE WAS NO MORE IN IT I HAD MANY MELANCHOLY HOURS AT THE BATH AFTER THE COMPANY WAS GONE
328-129766-0026 AND FOR RECRUITS OF MONEY YET I CHOSE TO COME BACK TO BATH FOR MY RESIDENCE BECAUSE BEING ON GOOD TERMS WITH THE WOMAN IN WHOSE HOUSE I LODGED IN THE SUMMER I FOUND THAT DURING THE WINTER I LIVED RATHER CHEAPER THERE
328-129766-0027 HERE I SAY I PASSED THE WINTER AS HEAVILY AS I HAD PASSED THE AUTUMN CHEERFULLY
328-129766-0028 OF WHAT LAY HARDEST UPON MY MIND AND PARTICULARLY THE NARROWNESS OF MY CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE LOSS OF MY FORTUNE BY THE DAMAGE OF MY GOODS AT SEA I TOLD HER ALSO THAT I HAD A MOTHER AND A BROTHER IN VIRGINIA IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES
328-129766-0029 AND AS I HAD REALLY WRITTEN BACK TO MY MOTHER IN PARTICULAR TO REPRESENT MY CONDITION AND THE GREAT LOSS I HAD RECEIVED
328-129766-0030 SO I DID NOT FAIL TO LET MY NEW FRIEND KNOW THAT I EXPECTED A SUPPLY FROM THENCE AND SO INDEED I DID AND AS THE SHIPS WENT FROM BRISTOL TO YORK RIVER IN VIRGINIA AND BACK AGAIN GENERALLY IN LESS TIME FROM LONDON
328-129766-0031 AND THAT MY BROTHER CORRESPONDED CHIEFLY AT BRISTOL I THOUGHT IT WAS MUCH BETTER FOR ME TO WAIT HERE FOR MY RETURNS THAN TO GO TO LONDON WHERE ALSO I HAD NOT THE LEAST ACQUAINTANCE MY NEW FRIEND APPEARED SENSIBLY AFFECTED WITH MY CONDITION
328-129766-0032 AND INDEED WAS SO VERY KIND AS TO REDUCE THE RATE OF MY LIVING WITH HER TO SO LOW A PRICE DURING THE WINTER THAT SHE CONVINCED ME SHE GOT NOTHING BY ME AND AS FOR LODGING DURING THE WINTER I PAID NOTHING AT ALL
328-129766-0033 TILL IT WAS FOUND NECESSARY TO DO OTHERWISE SHE HAD SOME PERSONS OF CHARACTER THAT FREQUENTLY LODGED IN HER HOUSE AND IN PARTICULAR THE GENTLEMAN WHO AS I SAID SINGLED ME OUT FOR HIS COMPANION
328-129766-0034 THE WINTER BEFORE AND HE CAME DOWN AGAIN WITH ANOTHER GENTLEMAN IN HIS COMPANY AND TWO SERVANTS AND LODGED IN THE SAME HOUSE
328-129766-0035 LETTING HIM KNOW THAT I WAS STILL WITH HER BUT SHE DENIED IT AND PROTESTED TO ME THAT SHE DID NOT AND HE SAID THE SAME IN A WORD THIS GENTLEMAN CAME DOWN AND CONTINUED TO SINGLE ME OUT FOR HIS PECULIAR CONFIDENCE AS WELL AS CONVERSATION
328-129766-0036 IF I MIGHT BELIEVE HIM WAS TO HIM
328-129766-0037 AND HE HAD SUCH AN OPINION OF MY VIRTUE THAT AS HE OFTEN PROFESSED HE BELIEVED IF HE SHOULD OFFER ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD REJECT HIM WITH CONTEMPT HE SOON UNDERSTOOD FROM ME THAT I WAS A WIDOW THAT I HAD ARRIVED AT BRISTOL FROM VIRGINIA BY THE LAST SHIPS
328-129766-0038 AND THAT I WAITED AT BATH TILL THE NEXT VIRGINIA FLEET SHOULD ARRIVE BY WHICH I EXPECTED CONSIDERABLE EFFECTS I UNDERSTOOD BY HIM AND BY OTHERS OF HIM THAT HE HAD A WIFE BUT THAT THE LADY WAS DISTEMPERED IN HER HEAD AND WAS UNDER THE CONDUCT
328-129766-0039 OF HER OWN RELATIONS WHICH HE CONSENTED TO TO AVOID ANY REFLECTIONS THAT MIGHT AS WAS NOT UNUSUAL IN SUCH CASES BE CAST ON HIM FOR MISMANAGING HER CURE AND IN THE MEANTIME HE CAME TO THE BATH TO DIVERT HIS THOUGHTS
328-129766-0040 FROM THE DISTURBANCE OF SUCH A MELANCHOLY CIRCUMSTANCE AS THAT WAS MY LANDLADY WHO OF HER OWN ACCORD ENCOURAGED THE CORRESPONDENCE ON ALL OCCASIONS GAVE ME AN ADVANTAGEOUS CHARACTER OF HIM
328-129766-0041 AS A MAN OF HONOUR AND OF VIRTUE AS WELL AS OF GREAT ESTATE AND INDEED I HAD A GREAT DEAL OF REASON TO SAY SO OF HIM TOO FOR THOUGH WE LODGED BOTH ON A FLOOR AND HE HAD FREQUENTLY COME INTO MY CHAMBER EVEN WHEN I WAS IN BED
328-129766-0042 AND I ALSO INTO HIS WHEN HE WAS IN BED YET HE NEVER OFFERED ANYTHING TO ME FURTHER THAN A KISS OR SO MUCH AS SOLICITED ME TO ANYTHING TILL LONG AFTER AS YOU SHALL HEAR
328-129766-0043 AND SHE AGAIN USED TO TELL ME SHE BELIEVED IT WAS SO FROM THE BEGINNING HOWEVER SHE USED TO TELL ME THAT SHE THOUGHT I OUGHT TO EXPECT SOME GRATIFICATION FROM HIM FOR MY COMPANY FOR INDEED HE DID AS IT WERE ENGROSS ME AND I WAS SELDOM FROM HIM
328-129766-0044 I TOLD HER I HAD NOT GIVEN HIM THE LEAST OCCASION TO THINK I WANTED IT
328-129766-0045 AND SHE DID SO AND MANAGED IT SO DEXTEROUSLY
328-129766-0046 AND SO I PUT OFF ALL ROOM FOR ANY OFFER FOR THE PRESENT HOWEVER IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE ATTACKED ME AGAIN
328-129766-0047 WHICH HE WAS SORRY FOR ASSURING ME THAT HE INQUIRED INTO IT WITH NO DESIGN TO SATISFY HIS OWN CURIOSITY BUT MERELY TO ASSIST ME IF THERE WAS ANY OCCASION BUT SINCE I
328-129766-0048 IN NEED OF ANY ASSISTANCE HE HAD BUT ONE THING MORE TO DESIRE OF ME AND THAT WAS THAT I WOULD PROMISE HIM THAT WHEN I WAS ANY WAY STRAITENED OR LIKE TO BE SO I WOULD FRANKLY TELL HIM OF IT AND THAT I WOULD MAKE USE OF HIM WITH THE SAME FREEDOM THAT HE MADE THE OFFER
328-129766-0049 ADDING THAT I SHOULD ALWAYS FIND I HAD A TRUE FRIEND THOUGH PERHAPS I WAS AFRAID TO TRUST HIM I OMITTED NOTHING THAT WAS FIT TO BE SAID BY ONE INFINITELY OBLIGED TO LET HIM KNOW THAT I HAD A DUE SENSE OF HIS KINDNESS
328-129766-0050 AND INDEED FROM THAT TIME I DID NOT APPEAR SO MUCH RESERVED TO HIM AS I HAD DONE BEFORE THOUGH STILL WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE STRICTEST VIRTUE ON BOTH SIDES BUT HOW FREE SOEVER OUR CONVERSATION WAS I COULD NOT ARRIVE TO THAT SORT OF FREEDOM
328-129766-0051 THOUGH I WAS SECRETLY VERY GLAD OF HIS OFFER SOME WEEKS PASSED AFTER THIS AND STILL I NEVER ASKED HIM FOR MONEY WHEN MY LANDLADY A CUNNING CREATURE WHO HAD OFTEN PRESSED ME TO IT BUT FOUND THAT I COULD NOT DO IT
328-129766-0052 MAKES A STORY OF HER OWN INVENTING AND COMES IN
328-129766-0053 OH WIDOW SAYS SHE I HAVE BAD NEWS TO TELL YOU THIS MORNING WHAT IS THAT SAID I ARE THE VIRGINIA SHIPS TAKEN BY THE FRENCH FOR THAT WAS MY FEAR NO NO SAYS SHE
328-129766-0054 BUT THE MAN YOU SENT TO BRISTOL YESTERDAY FOR MONEY IS COME BACK AND SAYS HE HAS BROUGHT NONE NOW I COULD BY NO MEANS LIKE HER PROJECT
328-129766-0055 WHICH INDEED HE DID NOT WANT AND I CLEARLY SAW THAT I SHOULD LOSE NOTHING BY BEING BACKWARD TO ASK SO I TOOK HER UP SHORT
328-129766-0056 SAID I FOR I ASSURE YOU HE BROUGHT ME ALL THE MONEY I SENT HIM FOR AND HERE IT IS SAID I PULLING OUT MY PURSE WITH ABOUT TWELVE GUINEAS IN IT AND ADDED I INTEND YOU SHALL HAVE MOST OF IT BY AND BY HE SEEMED DISTASTED A LITTLE AT HER TALKING
328-129766-0057 AS SHE DID AT FIRST AS WELL AS I TAKING IT AS I FANCIED HE WOULD AS SOMETHING FORWARD OF HER BUT WHEN HE SAW ME GIVE SUCH AN ANSWER HE CAME IMMEDIATELY TO HIMSELF AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING WE TALKED OF IT AGAIN WHEN I FOUND HE WAS FULLY SATISFIED
328-129766-0058 AND SMILING SAID HE HOPED I WOULD NOT WANT MONEY AND NOT TELL HIM OF IT AND THAT I HAD PROMISED HIM OTHERWISE I TOLD HIM I HAD BEEN VERY MUCH DISSATISFIED AT MY LANDLADY'S TALKING SO PUBLICLY THE DAY BEFORE OF WHAT SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
328-129766-0059 BUT I SUPPOSED SHE WANTED WHAT I OWED HER WHICH WAS ABOUT EIGHT GUINEAS WHICH I HAD RESOLVED TO GIVE HER AND HAD ACCORDINGLY
328-129766-0060 HE WAS IN A MIGHT GOOD HUMOUR WHEN HE HEARD ME SAY I HAD PAID HER AND IT WENT OFF INTO SOME OTHER DISCOURSE AT THAT TIME BUT THE NEXT MORNING HE HAVING HEARD ME UP ABOUT MY ROOM BEFORE HIM HE CALLED TO ME AND I ANSWERING HE ASKED ME TO COME INTO HIS CHAMBER
328-129766-0061 FOR HE SAID HE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY TO ME WHICH WAS OF SOME MOMENT AFTER SOME VERY KIND EXPRESSIONS HE ASKED ME IF I WOULD BE VERY HONEST TO HIM AND GIVE A SINCERE ANSWER TO ONE THING HE WOULD DESIRE OF ME
328-129766-0062 AT THE WORD SINCERE AND ASKING HIM IF I HAD EVER GIVEN HIM ANY ANSWERS WHICH WERE NOT SINCERE I PROMISED HIM I WOULD WHY THEN HIS REQUEST WAS HE SAID TO LET HIM SEE MY PURSE
328-129766-0063 I IMMEDIATELY PUT MY HAND INTO MY POCKET AND LAUGHING TO HIM PULLED IT OUT AND THERE WAS IN IT THREE GUINEAS AND A HALF
328-129766-0064 NOT BY A GREAT DEAL WELL THEN HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE ME PROMISE TO GO AND FETCH HIM ALL THE MONEY I HAD EVERY FARTHING I TOLD HIM I WOULD AND I WENT INTO MY CHAMBER AND FETCHED HIM A LITTLE PRIVATE DRAWER
328-129766-0065 WHERE I HAD ABOUT SIX GUINEAS MORE AND SOME SILVER AND THREW IT ALL DOWN UPON THE BED AND TOLD HIM THERE WAS ALL MY WEALTH HONESTLY TO A SHILLING HE LOOKED A LITTLE AT IT BUT DID NOT TELL IT
328-129766-0066 AND THEN REACHING HIS POCKET PULLED OUT A KEY AND BADE ME OPEN A LITTLE WALNUT TREE BOX HE HAD UPON THE TABLE AND BRING HIM SUCH A DRAWER WHICH I DID IN WHICH DRAWER THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY IN GOLD I BELIEVE NEAR TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS
328-129766-0067 BUT I KNEW NOT HOW MUCH HE TOOK THE DRAWER AND TAKING MY HAND MADE ME PUT IT IN AND TAKE A WHOLE HANDFUL I WAS BACKWARD AT THAT BUT HE HELD MY HAND HARD IN HIS HAND
328-129766-0068 WHEN I HAD DONE SO HE MADE ME PUT THEM INTO MY LAP AND TOOK MY LITTLE DRAWER
328-129766-0069 AND CARRY IT ALL HOME INTO MY OWN CHAMBER I RELATE THIS STORY THE MORE PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THE GOOD HUMOUR THERE WAS IN IT AND TO SHOW THE TEMPER WITH WHICH WE CONVERSED
328-129766-0070 AND IN A WORD PRESSED ME TO BUY BETTER
328-129766-0071 FOR I LOVED NOTHING IN THE WORLD BETTER THAN FINE CLOTHES I TOLD HIM I MUST HOUSEWIFE THE MONEY HE HAD LENT ME OR ELSE I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PAY HIM AGAIN HE THEN TOLD ME IN A FEW WORDS THAT AS HE HAD A SINCERE RESPECT FOR ME AND KNEW MY CIRCUMSTANCES
328-129766-0072 AND THAT HE THOUGHT I HAD MERITED IT FROM HIM BY GIVING HIM MY COMPANY SO ENTIRELY AS I HAD DONE AFTER THIS HE MADE ME TAKE A MAID AND KEEP HOUSE
328-129766-0073 WHICH I DID VERY WILLINGLY BELIEVING AS IT APPEARED THAT I SHOULD LOSE NOTHING BY IT NOR DID THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE FAIL TO FIND HER ACCOUNT IN IT TOO WE HAD LIVED THUS NEAR THREE MONTHS WHEN
328-129766-0074 THE COMPANY BEGINNING TO WEAR AWAY AT THE BATH HE TALKED OF GOING AWAY
328-129766-0075 I WAS NOT VERY EASY IN THAT PROPOSAL NOT KNOWING WHAT POSTURE I WAS TO LIVE IN THERE OR HOW HE MIGHT USE ME BUT WHILE THIS WAS IN DEBATE
328-129766-0076 CALLED SHEPTON WHERE HE HAD SOME BUSINESS AND WAS THERE TAKEN VERY ILL AND SO ILL THAT HE COULD NOT TRAVEL SO HE SENT HIS MAN BACK TO BATH TO BEG ME THAT I WOULD HIRE A COACH AND COME OVER TO HIM BEFORE HE WENT
328-129766-0077 HE HAD LEFT ALL HIS MONEY AND OTHER THINGS OF VALUE WITH ME AND WHAT TO DO WITH THEM I DID NOT KNOW BUT I SECURED THEM AS WELL AS I COULD AND LOCKED UP THE LODGINGS AND WENT TO HIM WHERE I FOUND HIM VERY ILL INDEED HOWEVER I PERSUADED HIM TO BE CARRIED
328-129766-0078 IN A LITTER TO THE BATH WHERE THERE WAS MORE HELP AND BETTER ADVICE TO BE HAD HE CONSENTED AND I BROUGHT HIM TO THE BATH WHICH WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES AS I REMEMBER HERE HE CONTINUED VERY ILL OF A FEVER
328-129766-0079 AND KEPT HIS BED FIVE WEEKS ALL WHICH TIME I NURSED HIM AND TENDED HIM MYSELF
328-129766-0080 INDEED IF I HAD BEEN HIS WIFE I COULD NOT HAVE DONE MORE I SAT UP WITH HIM SO MUCH AND SO OFTEN THAT AT LAST INDEED HE WOULD NOT LET ME SIT UP ANY LONGER AND THEN I GOT A PALLET BED INTO HIS ROOM AND LAY IN IT JUST AT HIS BED'S FEET
328-129766-0081 I WAS INDEED SENSIBLY AFFECTED WITH HIS CONDITION AND WITH THE APPREHENSION OF LOSING SUCH A FRIEND AS HE WAS AND WAS LIKE TO BE TO ME AND I USED TO SIT AND CRY BY HIM MANY HOURS TOGETHER
328-129766-0082 HOWEVER AT LAST HE GREW BETTER AND GAVE HOPES THAT HE WOULD RECOVER AS INDEED HE DID THOUGH VERY SLOWLY WERE IT OTHERWISE THAN WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY I SHOULD NOT BE BACKWARD TO DISCLOSE IT
328-129766-0083 AS IT IS APPARENT I HAVE DONE IN OTHER CASES IN THIS ACCOUNT BUT I AFFIRM THAT THROUGH ALL THIS CONVERSATION ABATING THE FREEDOM OF COMING INTO THE CHAMBER WHEN I OR HE WAS IN BED AND ABATING THE NECESSARY OFFICES
328-129766-0084 OF ATTENDING HIM NIGHT AND DAY WHEN HE WAS SICK THERE HAD NOT PASSED THE LEAST IMMODEST WORD OR ACTION BETWEEN US OH THAT IT HAD BEEN SO TO THE LAST AFTER SOME TIME HE GATHERED STRENGTH AND GREW WELL APACE
328-129766-0085 AND I WOULD HAVE REMOVED MY PALLET BED BUT HE WOULD NOT LET ME TILL HE WAS ABLE TO VENTURE HIMSELF WITHOUT ANYBODY TO SIT UP WITH HIM AND THEN I REMOVED TO MY OWN CHAMBER
328-129766-0086 AND WHEN HE GREW QUITE WELL HE MADE ME A PRESENT OF FIFTY GUINEAS FOR MY CARE AND AS HE CALLED IT FOR HAZARDING MY LIFE TO SAVE HIS AND NOW HE MADE DEEP PROTESTATIONS OF A SINCERE INVIOLABLE AFFECTION FOR ME
328-129766-0087 BUT ALL ALONG ATTESTED IT TO BE WITH THE UTMOST RESERVE FOR MY VIRTUE AND HIS OWN I TOLD HIM I WAS FULLY SATISFIED OF IT HE CARRIED IT THAT LENGTH THAT HE PROTESTED TO ME THAT IF HE WAS NAKED IN BED WITH ME
328-129766-0088 AS HE WOULD DEFEND IT IF I WAS ASSAULTED BY A RAVISHER I BELIEVED HIM AND TOLD HIM I DID SO BUT THIS DID NOT SATISFY HIM HE WOULD HE SAID
328-129766-0089 WAS A GREAT WHILE AFTER THIS THAT I HAD OCCASION ON MY OWN BUSINESS TO GO TO BRISTOL UPON WHICH HE HIRED ME A COACH AND WOULD GO WITH ME AND DID SO AND NOW INDEED OUR INTIMACY INCREASED
328-129766-0090 TO HAVE NO LODGING IN THE INN BUT IN ONE LARGE CHAMBER WITH TWO BEDS IN IT
328-129766-0091 AND COMING INTO THAT ROOM SAID VERY FRANKLY TO HIM SIR IT IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS TO INQUIRE WHETHER THE LADY BE YOUR SPOUSE OR NO
328-129766-0092 WHICH DREW QUITE ACROSS THE ROOM AND EFFECTUALLY DIVIDED THE BEDS WELL SAYS MY FRIEND VERY READILY THESE BEDS WILL DO AND AS FOR THE REST WE ARE TOO NEAR AKIN TO LIE TOGETHER THOUGH WE MAY LODGE NEAR ONE ANOTHER
328-129766-0093 HE DECENTLY WENT OUT OF THE ROOM TILL I WAS IN BED AND THEN WENT TO BED IN THE BED ON HIS OWN SIDE OF THE ROOM BUT LAY THERE TALKING TO ME A GREAT WHILE AT LAST REPEATING HIS USUAL SAYING THAT HE COULD LIE NAKED IN THE BED WITH ME AND NOT OFFER ME THE LEAST INJURY
328-129766-0094 HE STARTS OUT OF HIS BED AND NOW MY DEAR SAYS HE YOU SHALL SEE HOW JUST I WILL BE TO YOU AND THAT I CAN KEEP MY WORD AND AWAY HE COMES TO MY BED I RESISTED A LITTLE BUT I MUST CONFESS I SHOULD NOT HAVE RESISTED HIM MUCH
328-129766-0095 IF HE HAD NOT MADE THOSE PROMISES AT ALL SO AFTER A LITTLE STRUGGLE AS I SAID I LAY STILL AND LET HIM COME TO BED WHEN HE WAS THERE HE TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS AND SO I LAY ALL NIGHT WITH HIM BUT HE HAD NO MORE TO DO WITH ME OR OFFERED ANYTHING TO ME
328-129766-0096 OTHER THAN EMBRACING ME AS I SAY IN HIS ARMS NO NOT THE WHOLE NIGHT BUT ROSE UP AND DRESSED HIM IN THE MORNING AND LEFT ME AS INNOCENT FOR HIM AS I WAS THE DAY I WAS BORN THIS WAS A SURPRISING THING TO ME
328-129766-0097 AND PERHAPS MAY BE SO TO OTHERS WHO KNOW HOW THE LAWS OF NATURE WORK FOR HE WAS A STRONG VIGOROUS BRISK PERSON NOR DID HE ACT THUS ON A PRINCIPLE OF RELIGION AT ALL BUT OF MERE AFFECTION INSISTING ON IT
328-129766-0098 THAT THOUGH I WAS TO HIM TO MOST AGREEABLE WOMAN IN THE WORLD YET BECAUSE HE LOVED ME HE COULD NOT INJURE ME
332-128985-0000 WE WILL PASS TO THE CONSIDERATION OF A REGULAR OUT AND OUT PIRATE ONE FROM WHOSE MAST HEAD WOULD HAVE FLOATED THE BLACK FLAG WITH ITS SKULL AND CROSS BONES IF THAT EMBLEMATIC PIECE OF BUNTING HAD BEEN IN USE BY THE PIRATES OF THE PERIOD
332-128985-0001 AND HIS OWN WAS UNKNOWN AND THE BRAZILIAN BECAUSE HE WAS BORN IN BRAZIL THOUGH OF DUTCH PARENTS UNLIKE MOST OF HIS FELLOW PRACTITIONERS HE DID NOT GRADUALLY BECOME A PIRATE FROM HIS EARLY YOUTH
332-128985-0002 HE NEVER HAD AN INTENTION OF BEING ANYTHING ELSE AS SOON AS HE GREW TO BE A MAN HE BECAME A BLOODY BUCCANEER AND AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY HE JOINED A PIRATE CREW AND HAD MADE BUT A FEW VOYAGES WHEN IT WAS PERCEIVED BY HIS COMPANIONS
332-128985-0003 THAT HE WAS DESTINED TO BECOME A MOST REMARKABLE SEA ROBBER HE WAS OFFERED THE COMMAND OF A SHIP WITH A WELL ARMED CREW OF MARINE SAVAGES
332-128985-0004 HE FELL IN WITH A SPANISH SHIP LOADED WITH SILVER BULLION HAVING CAPTURED THIS HE SAILED WITH HIS PRIZE TO JAMAICA WHICH WAS ONE OF THE GREAT RESORTS OF THE ENGLISH BUCCANEERS THERE HIS SUCCESS DELIGHTED THE COMMUNITY
332-128985-0005 HIS TALENTS FOR THE CONDUCT OF GREAT PIRATICAL OPERATIONS SOON BECAME APPARENT AND HE WAS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE HEAD PIRATE OF THE WEST INDIES HE WAS NOW LOOKED UPON AS A HERO EVEN BY THOSE COLONISTS
332-128985-0006 WHO HAD NO SYMPATHY WITH PIRATES AND AS FOR ESQUEMELING HE SIMPLY WORSHIPPED THE GREAT BRAZILIAN DESPERADO IF HE HAD BEEN WRITING THE LIFE AND TIMES OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT JULIUS CAESAR OR MISTER GLADSTONE
332-128985-0007 HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE ENTHUSIASTIC IN HIS PRAISES AND AS IN THE ARABIAN NIGHTS THE ROC IS DESCRIBED AS THE GREATEST OF BIRDS SO IN THE EYES OF THE BUCCANEER BIOGRAPHER THIS ROC WAS THE GREATEST OF PIRATES
332-128985-0008 THAT ROC NOW BECAME FAMOUS THE BETTER HE BECAME KNOWN THE MORE GENERAL WAS THE FEAR AND RESPECT FELT FOR HIM AND WE ARE TOLD THAT THE MOTHERS OF THE ISLANDS USED TO PUT THEIR CHILDREN TO SLEEP BY THREATENING THEM WITH THE TERRIBLE ROC IF THEY DID NOT CLOSE THEIR EYES
332-128985-0009 THIS STORY HOWEVER I REGARD WITH A GREAT DEAL OF DOUBT
332-128985-0010 BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS AN EASY THING TO FRIGHTEN A CHILD INTO GOING TO SLEEP IF I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO MAKE A YOUNGSTER TAKE A NAP I SHOULD SAY NOTHING OF THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS IN CUBA OR OF THE PERSECUTIONS OF THE ARMENIANS
332-128985-0011 THIS RENOWNED PIRATE FROM BRAZIL MUST HAVE BEEN A TERRIBLE FELLOW TO LOOK AT HE WAS STRONG AND BRAWNY HIS FACE WAS SHORT AND VERY WIDE WITH HIGH CHEEK BONES AND HIS EXPRESSION PROBABLY RESEMBLED THAT OF A PUG DOG
332-128985-0012 HIS EYEBROWS WERE ENORMOUSLY LARGE AND BUSHY AND FROM UNDER THEM HE GLARED AT HIS MUNDANE SURROUNDINGS HE WAS NOT A MAN WHOSE SPIRIT COULD BE QUELLED BY LOOKING HIM STEADFASTLY IN THE EYE IT WAS HIS CUSTOM IN THE DAYTIME TO WALK ABOUT
332-128985-0013 CARRYING A DRAWN CUTLASS RESTING EASILY UPON HIS ARM EDGE UP VERY MUCH AS A FINE GENTLEMAN CARRIES HIS HIGH SILK HAT AND ANY ONE WHO SHOULD IMPERTINENTLY STARE OR ENDEAVOR TO QUELL HIS HIGH SPIRITS IN ANY OTHER WAY
332-128985-0014 WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FELT THE EDGE OF THAT CUTLASS DESCENDING RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS PHYSICAL ORGANISM HE WAS A MAN WHO INSISTED UPON BEING OBEYED AND IF ANY ONE OF HIS CREW BEHAVED IMPROPERLY OR WAS EVEN FOUND IDLE
332-128985-0015 BUT ALTHOUGH HE WAS SO STRICT AND EXACTING DURING THE BUSINESS SESSIONS OF HIS PIRATICAL YEAR BY WHICH I MEAN WHEN HE WAS CRUISING AROUND AFTER PRIZES HE WAS VERY MUCH MORE DISAGREEABLE WHEN HE WAS TAKING A VACATION
332-128985-0016 ON HIS RETURN TO JAMAICA AFTER ONE OF HIS EXPEDITIONS IT WAS HIS HABIT TO GIVE HIMSELF SOME RELAXATION AFTER THE HARDSHIPS AND DANGERS THROUGH WHICH HE HAD PASSED AND ON SUCH OCCASIONS IT WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO ROC TO GET HIMSELF THOROUGHLY DRUNK
332-128985-0017 WITH HIS CUTLASS WAVING HIGH IN THE AIR HE WOULD RUSH OUT INTO THE STREET AND TAKE A WHACK AT EVERY ONE WHOM HE MET AS FAR AS WAS POSSIBLE THE CITIZENS ALLOWED HIM TO HAVE THE STREET TO HIMSELF AND IT WAS NOT AT ALL LIKELY
332-128985-0018 THAT HIS VISITS TO JAMAICA WERE LOOKED FORWARD TO WITH ANY EAGER ANTICIPATIONS ROC IT MAY BE SAID WAS NOT ONLY A BLOODY PIRATE BUT A BLOODED ONE HE WAS THOROUGHBRED
332-128985-0019 FROM THE TIME HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO ASSERT HIS INDIVIDUALITY HE HAD BEEN A PIRATE AND THERE WAS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD EVER REFORM HIMSELF INTO ANYTHING ELSE THERE WERE NO EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES IN HIS CASE
332-128985-0020 IN HIS NATURE THERE WAS NO ALLOY NOR MODERATION NOR FORBEARANCE THE APPRECIATIVE ESQUEMELING WHO MIGHT BE CALLED THE BOSWELL OF THE BUCCANEERS COULD NEVER HAVE MET HIS HERO ROC
332-128985-0021 WHEN THAT BUSHY BEARDED PIRATE WAS RUNNING AMUCK IN THE STREETS BUT IF HE HAD IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT HIS BOOK WOULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN HE ASSURES US THAT WHEN ROC WAS NOT DRUNK HE WAS ESTEEMED BUT AT THE SAME TIME FEARED
332-128985-0022 BUT THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS OF GAINING ESTEEM AND ROC'S METHOD CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED VERY WELL IN THE CASE OF HIS LITERARY ASSOCIATE AS WE HAVE SEEN THE HATRED OF THE SPANIARDS BY THE BUCCANEERS BEGAN VERY EARLY IN THE SETTLEMENT OF THE WEST INDIES
332-128985-0023 BUT IN ALL THE INSTANCES OF FEROCIOUS ENMITY TOWARD THE SPANIARDS THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING TO EQUAL THE FEELINGS OF ROC THE BRAZILIAN UPON THAT SUBJECT HIS DISLIKE TO EVERYTHING SPANISH AROSE HE DECLARED
332-128985-0024 SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TOO BAD FOR A SPANIARD THE OBJECT OF HIS LIFE WAS TO WAGE BITTER WAR AGAINST SPANISH SHIPS AND SPANISH SETTLEMENTS HE SELDOM GAVE ANY QUARTER TO HIS PRISONERS
332-128985-0025 THEN THERE WAS NOTHING FOR THEM TO DO BUT TO GO ON BOARD THEIR VESSELS AND PUT OUT TO SEA IN SEARCH OF SOME FRESH PRIZE SO FAR ROC'S CAREER HAD BEEN VERY MUCH LIKE THAT OF MANY OTHER COMPANIONS OF THE COAST
332-128985-0026 DIFFERING FROM THEM ONLY IN RESPECT TO INTENSITY AND FORCE BUT HE WAS A CLEVER MAN WITH IDEAS
332-128985-0027 HE WAS CRUISING ABOUT CAMPEACHY WITHOUT SEEING ANY CRAFT THAT WAS WORTH CAPTURING
332-128985-0028 AND FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE WERE ANY SPANISH VESSELS IN THE BAY WHICH WERE WELL LADEN AND WHICH WERE LIKELY SOON TO COME OUT SO WITH A SMALL BOAT FILLED WITH SOME OF HIS TRUSTY MEN HE ROWED QUIETLY INTO THE PORT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD DISCOVER
332-128985-0029 AND HAD SENT THAT MILD MANNERED OBSERVER INTO THE HARBOR TO INVESTIGATE INTO THE STATE OF AFFAIRS
332-128985-0030 BUT HE CHOSE TO GO HIMSELF AND HE CAME TO GRIEF NO SOONER DID THE PEOPLE ON THE SHIPS LYING IN THE HARBOR BEHOLD A BOAT APPROACHING WITH A BIG BROWED BROAD JAWED MARINER SITTING IN THE STERN
332-128985-0031 AND WITH A GOOD MANY MORE BROAD BACKED HAIRY MARINERS THAN WERE NECESSARY PULLING AT THE OARS THAN THEY GAVE THE ALARM
332-128985-0032 ROC MUST HAVE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE IN HIS OWN POWERS OR PERHAPS HE RELIED SOMEWHAT UPON THE FEAR WHICH HIS VERY PRESENCE EVOKED BUT HE MADE A MISTAKE THIS TIME HE HAD RUN INTO THE LION'S JAW AND THE LION HAD CLOSED HIS TEETH UPON HIM
332-128985-0033 WHEN THE PIRATE CAPTAIN AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE BROUGHT BEFORE THE GOVERNOR HE MADE NO PRETENCE OF PUTTING THEM TO TRIAL BUCCANEERS WERE OUTLAWED BY THE SPANISH
332-128985-0034 AND WERE CONSIDERED AS WILD BEASTS TO BE KILLED WITHOUT MERCY WHEREVER CAUGHT CONSEQUENTLY ROC AND HIS MEN WERE THROWN INTO A DUNGEON AND CONDEMNED TO BE EXECUTED IF HOWEVER THE SPANISH GOVERNOR HAD KNOWN WHAT WAS GOOD FOR HIMSELF
332-128985-0035 DURING THE TIME THAT PREPARATIONS WERE GOING ON FOR MAKING EXAMPLES OF THESE IMPERTINENT PIRATES
332-128985-0036 THIS WAS A BRANCH OF THE BUSINESS IN WHICH A CAPABLE PIRATE WAS OBLIGED TO BE PROFICIENT IF HE COULD NOT GET HIMSELF OUT OF SCRAPES HE COULD NOT EXPECT TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS CASE THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF CUTTING DOWN SENTINELS
332-128985-0037 OR JUMPING OVERBOARD WITH A COUPLE OF WINE JARS FOR A LIFE PRESERVER OR OF DOING ANY OF THOSE ORDINARY THINGS WHICH PIRATES WERE IN THE HABIT OF DOING WHEN ESCAPING FROM THEIR CAPTORS
332-128985-0038 INSIDE OF A FORTRESS AND IF THEY ESCAPED FROM THIS THEY WOULD FIND THEMSELVES UNARMED IN THE MIDST OF A BODY OF SPANISH SOLDIERS THEIR STOUT ARMS AND THEIR STOUT HEARTS WERE OF NO USE TO THEM NOW
332-128985-0039 AND THEY WERE OBLIGED TO DEPEND UPON THEIR WITS IF THEY HAD ANY ROC HAD PLENTY OF WIT AND HE USED IT WELL THERE WAS A SLAVE PROBABLY NOT A NEGRO NOR A NATIVE
332-128985-0040 WHO CAME IN TO BRING HIM FOOD AND DRINK AND BY THE MEANS OF THIS MAN THE PIRATE HOPED TO PLAY A TRICK UPON THE GOVERNOR HE PROMISED THE SLAVE THAT IF HE WOULD HELP HIM AND HE TOLD HIM IT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO DO SO
332-128985-0041 HE WOULD GIVE HIM MONEY ENOUGH TO BUY HIS FREEDOM AND TO RETURN TO HIS FRIENDS AND THIS OF COURSE WAS A GREAT INDUCEMENT TO THE POOR FELLOW WHO MAY HAVE BEEN AN ENGLISHMAN OR A FRENCHMAN IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES AT HOME THE SLAVE AGREED TO THE PROPOSALS
332-128985-0042 AND THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO BRING SOME WRITING MATERIALS TO ROC WHO THEREUPON BEGAN THE COMPOSITION OF A LETTER
332-128985-0043 WHEN HE WAS COMING INTO THE BAY ROC HAD NOTICED A LARGE FRENCH VESSEL THAT WAS LYING AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE TOWN
332-128985-0044 BY THE HAND OF ROC WENT ON TO SAY THAT IF ANY HARM SHOULD COME TO THESE BRAVE MEN WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN AND IMPRISONED WHEN THEY WERE DOING NO HARM TO ANYBODY HE WOULD SWEAR IN HIS MOST SOLEMN MANNER THAT NEVER
332-128985-0045 FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE WOULD HE GIVE QUARTER TO ANY SPANIARD WHO MIGHT FALL INTO HIS HANDS AND HE MOREOVER THREATENED THAT ANY KIND OF VENGEANCE WHICH SHOULD BECOME POSSIBLE FOR THE BUCCANEERS AND FRENCH UNITED TO INFLICT UPON THE SPANISH SHIPS
332-128985-0046 OR UPON THE TOWN OF CAMPEACHY SHOULD BE TAKEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER HE SHOULD HEAR OF ANY INJURY THAT MIGHT BE INFLICTED UPON THE UNFORTUNATE MEN WHO WERE THEN LYING IMPRISONED IN THE FORTRESS WHEN THE SLAVE CAME BACK TO ROC
332-128985-0047 THE LETTER WAS GIVEN TO HIM WITH VERY PARTICULAR DIRECTIONS AS TO WHAT HE WAS TO DO WITH IT HE WAS TO DISGUISE HIMSELF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SO THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE RECOGNIZED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE PLACE AND THEN IN THE NIGHT HE WAS TO MAKE HIS WAY OUT OF THE TOWN
332-128985-0048 AND EARLY IN THE MORNING HE WAS TO RETURN AS IF HE HAD BEEN WALKING ALONG THE SHORE OF THE HARBOR WHEN HE WAS TO STATE THAT HE HAD BEEN PUT ON SHORE FROM THE FRENCH VESSEL IN THE OFFING WITH A LETTER WHICH HE WAS TO PRESENT TO THE GOVERNOR THE SLAVE PERFORMED HIS PART OF THE BUSINESS VERY WELL
332-128985-0049 THE NEXT DAY WET AND BEDRAGGLED FROM MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE WEEDS AND MUD OF THE COAST HE PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE FORTRESS WITH HIS LETTER AND WHEN HE WAS ALLOWED TO TAKE IT TO THE GOVERNOR NO ONE SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS A PERSON EMPLOYED ABOUT THE PLACE
332-128985-0050 HAVING FULFILLED HIS MISSION HE DEPARTED AND WHEN SEEN AGAIN HE WAS THE SAME SERVANT WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS TO CARRY FOOD TO THE PRISONERS THE GOVERNOR READ THE LETTER WITH A DISQUIETED MIND
332-128985-0051 HE KNEW THAT THE FRENCH SHIP WHICH WAS LYING OUTSIDE THE HARBOR WAS A POWERFUL VESSEL AND HE DID NOT LIKE FRENCH SHIPS ANYWAY THE TOWN HAD ONCE BEEN TAKEN AND VERY BADLY TREATED BY A LITTLE FLEET OF FRENCH AND ENGLISH BUCCANEERS
332-128985-0052 AND HE WAS VERY ANXIOUS THAT NOTHING OF THE KIND SHOULD HAPPEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO GREAT SPANISH FORCE IN THE HARBOR AT THAT TIME AND HE DID NOT KNOW HOW MANY BUCCANEERING VESSELS MIGHT BE ABLE TO GATHER TOGETHER IN THE BAY
332-128985-0053 IF IT SHOULD BECOME KNOWN THAT THE GREAT PIRATE ROC HAD BEEN PUT TO DEATH IN CAMPEACHY IT WAS AN UNUSUAL THING FOR A PRISONER TO HAVE SUCH POWERFUL FRIENDS SO NEAR BY AND THE GOVERNOR TOOK ROC'S CASE INTO MOST EARNEST CONSIDERATION
332-128985-0054 AND HE DETERMINED TO GET RID OF HIM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE HE FELT HIMSELF IN THE POSITION OF A MAN WHO HAS STOLEN A BABY BEAR AND WHO HEARS THE ROAR OF AN APPROACHING PARENT THROUGH THE WOODS
332-128985-0055 TO THROW AWAY THE CUB AND WALK OFF AS THOUGH HE HAD NO IDEA THERE WERE ANY BEARS IN THAT FOREST WOULD BE THE INCLINATION OF A MAN SO SITUATED AND TO GET RID OF THE GREAT PIRATE WITHOUT PROVOKING THE VENGEANCE OF HIS FRIENDS
332-128985-0056 WAS THE NATURAL INCLINATION OF THE GOVERNOR NOW ROC AND HIS MEN WERE TREATED WELL AND HAVING BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE GOVERNOR WERE TOLD THAT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR HAVING COMMITTED NO OVERT ACT OF DISORDER THEY WOULD BE SET AT LIBERTY AND SHIPPED TO ENGLAND
332-128985-0057 UPON THE SINGLE CONDITION THAT THEY WOULD ABANDON PIRACY AND AGREE TO BECOME QUIET CITIZENS IN WHATEVER RESPECTABLE VOCATION THEY MIGHT SELECT TO THESE TERMS ROC AND HIS MEN AGREED WITHOUT ARGUMENT
332-128985-0058 THEY DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD RETIRE FROM THE BUCCANEERING BUSINESS AND THAT NOTHING WOULD SUIT THEM BETTER THAN TO RETURN TO THE WAYS OF CIVILIZATION AND VIRTUE THERE WAS A SHIP ABOUT TO DEPART FOR SPAIN AND ON THIS THE GOVERNOR GAVE ROC AND HIS MEN FREE PASSAGE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN
332-128985-0059 THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT OUR BUCCANEERS WOULD HAVE MUCH PREFERRED TO HAVE BEEN PUT ON BOARD THE FRENCH VESSEL BUT AS THE SPANISH GOVERNOR HAD STARTED HIS PRISONERS ON THE ROAD TO REFORM HE DID NOT WISH TO THROW THEM INTO THE WAY OF TEMPTATION
332-128985-0060 BY ALLOWING THEM TO ASSOCIATE WITH SUCH WICKED COMPANIONS AS FRENCHMEN AND ROC MADE NO SUGGESTION OF THE KIND KNOWING VERY WELL HOW GREATLY ASTONISHED THE FRENCH CAPTAIN WOULD BE IF THE GOVERNOR WERE TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM ON THE SUBJECT
332-128985-0061 ON THE VOYAGE TO SPAIN ROC WAS ON HIS GOOD BEHAVIOR AND HE WAS A MAN WHO KNEW HOW TO BEHAVE VERY WELL WHEN IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY NO DOUBT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MANY DULL DAYS ON BOARD SHIP
332-128985-0062 WHEN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN DELIGHTED TO GAMBLE TO GET DRUNK AND TO RUN AMUCK UP AND DOWN THE DECK BUT HE CAREFULLY ABSTAINED FROM ALL THESE RECREATIONS AND SHOWED HIMSELF TO BE SUCH AN ABLE BODIED AND WILLING SAILOR
332-128985-0063 THAT THE CAPTAIN ALLOWED HIM TO SERVE AS ONE OF THE CREW ROC KNEW HOW TO DO A GREAT MANY THINGS NOT ONLY COULD HE MURDER AND ROB BUT HE KNEW HOW TO TURN AN HONEST PENNY WHEN THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY OF FILLING HIS PURSE HE HAD LEARNED AMONG THE INDIANS
332-128985-0064 HOW TO SHOOT FISH WITH BOW AND ARROWS AND ON THIS VOYAGE ACROSS THE ATLANTIC HE OCCUPIED ALL HIS SPARE TIME IN SITTING IN THE RIGGING AND SHOOTING THE FISH WHICH DISPORTED THEMSELVES ABOUT THE VESSEL
332-128985-0065 THESE FISH HE SOLD TO THE OFFICERS AND WE ARE TOLD THAT IN THIS WAY HE EARNED NO LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS PERHAPS THAT MANY DOLLARS IF THIS ACCOUNT IS TRUE FISH MUST HAVE BEEN VERY COSTLY IN THOSE DAYS
332-128985-0066 IN EVERY WAY ROC BEHAVED SO WELL THAT FOR HIS SAKE ALL HIS MEN WERE TREATED KINDLY AND ALLOWED MANY PRIVILEGES BUT WHEN THIS PARTY OF REFORMED PIRATES REACHED SPAIN AND WERE ALLOWED TO GO WHERE THEY PLEASED
332-128985-0067 THEY THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE OATHS THEY HAD TAKEN TO ABANDON PIRACY THAN THEY THOUGHT OF THE OATHS WHICH THEY HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF THROWING RIGHT AND LEFT
332-128985-0068 BUT AS SOON AS THEY COULD MANAGE IT THEY SAILED BACK TO THE WEST INDIES AND EVENTUALLY FOUND THEMSELVES IN JAMAICA
332-128985-0069 NOT ONLY DID ROC CAST FROM HIM EVERY THOUGHT OF REFORMATION AND A RESPECTABLE LIFE BUT HE DETERMINED TO BEGIN THE BUSINESS OF PIRACY ON A GRANDER SCALE THAN EVER BEFORE HE MADE A COMPACT WITH AN OLD FRENCH BUCCANEER
332-128985-0070 AND WITH A LARGE COMPANY OF BUCCANEERS HE ACTUALLY SET OUT TO TAKE A TOWN HAVING LOST EVERYTHING HE POSSESSED AND HAVING PASSED SUCH A LONG TIME WITHOUT ANY EMPLOYMENT MORE PROFITABLE THAN THAT OF SHOOTING FISH WITH A BOW AND ARROWS
332-128985-0071 OUR DOUGHTY PIRATE NOW DESIRED TO MAKE A GRAND STRIKE AND IF HE COULD TAKE A TOWN AND PILLAGE IT OF EVERYTHING VALUABLE IT CONTAINED HE WOULD MAKE A VERY GOOD FORTUNE IN A VERY SHORT TIME AND MIGHT RETIRE IF HE CHOSE
332-128985-0072 FROM THE ACTIVE PRACTICE OF HIS PROFESSION
332-128985-0073 IN YUCATAN AND ALTHOUGH THIS WAS A BOLD AND RASH UNDERTAKING THE TWO PIRATES WERE BOLD AND RASH ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING ROC HAD BEEN A PRISONER IN MERIDA AND ON ACCOUNT OF HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE TOWN HE BELIEVED THAT HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS COULD LAND UPON THE COAST
332-128985-0074 IF THEY COULD DO THIS IT WOULD BE AN EASY MATTER TO RUSH UPON THE UNSUSPECTING GARRISON AND HAVING ANNIHILATED THESE MAKE THEMSELVES MASTERS OF THE TOWN BUT THEIR PLANS DID NOT WORK VERY WELL THEY WERE DISCOVERED BY SOME INDIANS
332-128985-0075 AFTER THEY HAD LANDED WHO HURRIED TO MERIDA AND GAVE NOTICE OF THE APPROACH OF THE BUCCANEERS CONSEQUENTLY WHEN ROC AND HIS COMPANIONS REACHED THE TOWN THEY FOUND THE GARRISON PREPARED FOR THEM CANNONS LOADED AND ALL THE APPROACHES GUARDED
332-128985-0076 STILL THE PIRATES DID NOT HESITATE THEY ADVANCED FIERCELY TO THE ATTACK JUST AS THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHEN THEY WERE BOARDING A SPANISH VESSEL BUT THEY SOON FOUND THAT FIGHTING ON LAND WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM FIGHTING AT SEA
332-128985-0077 IN A MARINE COMBAT IT IS SELDOM THAT A PARTY OF BOARDERS IS ATTACKED IN THE REAR BY THE ENEMY ALTHOUGH ON LAND SUCH METHODS OF WARFARE MAY ALWAYS BE EXPECTED
332-128985-0078 AND THEY WERE THEREFORE GREATLY DISMAYED WHEN A PARTY OF HORSEMEN FROM THE TOWN WHO HAD MADE A WIDE DETOUR THROUGH THE WOODS SUDDENLY CHARGED UPON THEIR REAR
332-128985-0079 TRIBUTOR AND A GREAT MANY OF THE PIRATES WERE KILLED OR TAKEN AND ROC THE BRAZILIAN HAD A TERRIBLE FALL THIS MOST MEMORABLE FALL OCCURRED IN THE ESTIMATION OF JOHN ESQUEMELING
332-128985-0080 WHO KNEW ALL ABOUT THE ATTACK ON MERIDA AND WHO WROTE THE ACCOUNT OF IT BUT HE HAD NEVER EXPECTED TO BE CALLED UPON TO RECORD THAT HIS GREAT HERO ROC THE BRAZILIAN SAVED HIS LIFE AFTER THE UTTER DEFEAT OF HIMSELF AND HIS COMPANIONS
332-128985-0081 BY IGNOMINIOUSLY RUNNING AWAY THE LOYAL CHRONICLER HAD AS FIRM A BELIEF IN THE ABSOLUTE INABILITY OF HIS HERO TO FLY FROM DANGER AS WAS SHOWN BY THE SCOTTISH DOUGLAS WHEN HE STOOD
332-128985-0082 COME ONE COME ALL THE BUSHY BROWED PIRATE OF THE DRAWN CUTLASS
332-128985-0083 WHO WOULD EVEN SURRENDER TO SAY NOTHING OF RUNNING AWAY THAT ESQUEMELING COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE THAT ROC HAD RETREATED FROM HIS ENEMIES DESERTED HIS FRIENDS AND TURNED HIS BACK UPON THE PRINCIPLES WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS SO TRUCULENTLY PROCLAIMED
332-128985-0084 BUT THIS DOWNFALL OF A HERO SIMPLY SHOWS THAT ESQUEMELING ALTHOUGH HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE PIRATICAL BODY AND WAS PROUD TO CONSIDER HIMSELF A BUCCANEER DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE TRUE NATURE OF A PIRATE UNDER THE BRUTALITY
332-128985-0085 THE CRUELTY THE DISHONESTY AND THE RECKLESSNESS OF THE SEA ROBBERS OF THOSE DAYS THERE WAS NEARLY ALWAYS MEANNESS AND COWARDICE ROC AS WE HAVE SAID IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS SKETCH WAS A TYPICAL PIRATE
332-128985-0086 UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES HE SHOWED HIMSELF TO HAVE ALL THOSE BRAVE AND SAVAGE QUALITIES WHICH ESQUEMELING ESTEEMED AND REVERED AND UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES HE SHOWED THOSE OTHER QUALITIES WHICH ESQUEMELING DESPISED
332-128985-0087 BUT WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO MAKE UP THE TRUE CHARACTER OF A PIRATE THE HISTORIAN JOHN SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH CUT UP BY THE MANNER IN WHICH HIS FAVORITE HERO HAD ROUNDED OFF HIS PIRATICAL CAREER
332-128985-0088 AND AFTER THAT HE ENTIRELY DROPPED ROC FROM HIS CHRONICLES
3374-298025-0000 AN OLD MAN IN AGONY BUT STILL GENIAL AND FULL OF DELICATE WIT DRAPES THE MOTLEY SPECTACLE OF HIS LIFELIKE WRITINGS WITH THE COSTLY TAPESTRY OF A PREFACE WHICH IN ITSELF IS A BEAUTIFUL AND ROMANTIC PAINTING
3374-298025-0001 BUT WHAT SHALL MY SPIRIT BESTOW UPON ITS OFFSPRING WHICH LIKE ITS PARENT IS AS POOR IN POESY AS IT IS RICH IN LOVE JUST ONE WORD A PARTING TROPE
3374-298025-0002 IT IS NOT ALONE THE ROYAL EAGLE WHO MAY DESPISE THE CROAKING OF THE RAVEN THE SWAN TOO IS PROUD AND TAKES NO NOTE OF IT
3374-298025-0003 HUMAN BEINGS AND WHAT THEY WANT AND DO
3374-298025-0004 A FRESH WARM BREATH OF LIFE AND LOVE FANNED ME RUSTLING AND STIRRING IN ALL THE BRANCHES OF THE VERDANT GROVE I GAZED AND ENJOYED IT ALL THE RICH GREEN THE WHITE BLOSSOMS AND THE GOLDEN FRUIT
3374-298025-0005 AND IN MY MIND'S EYE I SAW TOO IN MANY FORMS MY ONE AND ONLY BELOVED NOW AS A LITTLE GIRL NOW AS A YOUNG LADY IN THE FULL BLOOM AND ENERGY OF LOVE AND WOMANHOOD
3374-298025-0006 AND NOW AS A DIGNIFIED MOTHER WITH HER DEMURE BABE IN HER ARMS I BREATHED THE SPRING AND I SAW CLEARLY ALL ABOUT ME EVERLASTING YOUTH SMILING I SAID TO MYSELF
3374-298025-0007 FROM THIS FEELING OR THOUGHT NOTHING COULD HAVE TURNED ME NEITHER GENERAL DESPAIR NOR PERSONAL FEAR FOR I BELIEVED
3374-298025-0008 BUT I GLADLY LOST MYSELF IN ALL THOSE BLENDINGS AND INTERTWININGS OF JOY AND PAIN FROM WHICH SPRING THE SPICE OF LIFE AND THE FLOWER OF FEELING SPIRITUAL PLEASURE AS WELL AS SENSUAL BLISS
3374-298025-0009 A SUBTLE FIRE FLOWED THROUGH MY VEINS
3374-298025-0010 IT WAS NOT ONLY THE WISH TO RELIEVE THE TORMENTING STING OF MY DESIRE AND TO COOL THE SWEET FIRE BY GRATIFICATION IT WAS NOT FOR YOUR LIPS THAT I LONGED OR FOR YOUR EYES OR FOR YOUR BODY
3374-298025-0011 A MARVELOUS MINGLING OF MEMORIES AND DESIRES ALL THE MYSTERIES OF CAPRICE IN MAN AND WOMAN SEEMED TO HOVER ABOUT ME WHEN SUDDENLY IN MY SOLITUDE
3374-298025-0012 AND YET WITH CALM PRESENCE OF MIND I WATCHED FOR THE SLIGHTEST SIGN OF JOY IN YOU SO THAT NOT ONE SHOULD ESCAPE ME TO IMPAIR THE HARMONY I NOT ONLY ENJOYED BUT I FELT AND ENJOYED
3374-298025-0013 THE ENJOYMENT YOU ARE SO EXTRAORDINARILY CLEVER DEAREST LUCINDA THAT YOU HAVE DOUBTLESS LONG ERE THIS BEGUN TO SUSPECT THAT THIS IS ALL NOTHING BUT A BEAUTIFUL DREAM
3374-298025-0014 NOT LONG AGO I WAS STANDING BY THE WINDOW HOW LONG I DO NOT KNOW FOR ALONG WITH THE OTHER RULES OF REASON AND MORALITY I COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT THE LAPSE OF TIME WELL I WAS STANDING BY THE WINDOW AND LOOKING OUT INTO THE OPEN
3374-298025-0015 THE MORNING CERTAINLY DESERVES TO BE CALLED BEAUTIFUL THE AIR IS STILL AND QUITE WARM AND THE VERDURE HERE BEFORE ME IS FRESH AND EVEN AS THE WIDE LAND UNDULATES IN HILLS AND DALES
3374-298025-0016 SO THE CALM BROAD SILVERY RIVER WINDS ALONG IN GREAT BENDS AND SWEEPS UNTIL IT AND THE LOVER'S FANTASY CRADLED UPON IT LIKE THE SWAN PASS AWAY INTO THE DISTANCE AND LOSE THEMSELVES IN THE IMMEASURABLE
3374-298025-0017 MY VISION DOUBTLESS OWES THE GROVE AND ITS SOUTHERN COLOR EFFECT TO THE HUGE MASS OF FLOWERS HERE BESIDE ME
3374-298025-0018 ALL THE REST IS READILY EXPLAINED BY PSYCHOLOGY
3374-298025-0019 ALL EXCEPT THAT NOT LONG AGO I WAS STANDING BY THE WINDOW AND DOING NOTHING AND THAT I AM NOW SITTING HERE AND DOING SOMETHING SOMETHING WHICH IS PERHAPS LITTLE MORE THAN NOTHING PERHAPS EVEN LESS
3374-298025-0020 I WAS JUST ON THE POINT OF UNFOLDING TO YOU IN CLEAR AND PRECISE PERIODS THE EXACT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD HISTORY OF OUR FRIVOLITIES AND OF MY DULNESS I WAS GOING TO EXPOUND TO YOU STEP BY STEP
3374-298025-0021 IN ACCORDANCE WITH NATURAL LAWS THE MISUNDERSTANDINGS THAT ATTACK THE HIDDEN CENTRE OF THE LOVELIEST EXISTENCE AND TO CONFESS TO YOU THE MANIFOLD EFFECTS OF MY AWKWARDNESS
3374-298025-0022 I WAS ABOUT TO DESCRIBE THE APPRENTICESHIP OF MY MANHOOD
3374-298025-0023 A PERIOD WHICH TAKEN AS A WHOLE OR IN PARTS I CAN NEVER LOOK BACK UPON WITHOUT A GREAT DEAL OF INWARD AMUSEMENT A LITTLE MELANCHOLY AND CONSIDERABLE SELF SATISFACTION
3374-298025-0024 STILL AS A REFINED LOVER AND WRITER I WILL ENDEAVOR TO REFASHION THE COARSE OCCURRENCE AND ADAPT IT TO MY PURPOSE FOR ME AND FOR THIS BOOK HOWEVER FOR MY LOVE OF IT AND FOR ITS INNER DEVELOPMENT
3374-298025-0025 THERE IS NO BETTER ADAPTATION OF MEANS TO ENDS THAN THIS NAMELY THAT RIGHT AT THE START I BEGIN BY ABOLISHING WHAT WE CALL ORDERLY ARRANGEMENT KEEP MYSELF ENTIRELY ALOOF FROM IT
3374-298025-0026 FRANKLY CLAIMING AND ASSERTING THE RIGHT TO A CHARMING CONFUSION THIS IS ALL THE MORE NECESSARY INASMUCH AS THE MATERIAL WHICH OUR LIFE AND LOVE OFFERS TO MY SPIRIT AND TO MY PEN IS SO INCESSANTLY PROGRESSIVE
3374-298025-0027 AND SO INFLEXIBLY SYSTEMATIC IF THE FORM WERE ALSO OF THAT CHARACTER THIS IN ITS WAY UNIQUE LETTER WOULD THEN ACQUIRE AN INTOLERABLE UNITY AND MONOTONY
3374-298025-0028 SO I USE MY INCONTESTABLE RIGHT TO A CONFUSED STYLE BY INSERTING HERE IN THE WRONG PLACE ONE OF THE MANY INCOHERENT SHEETS WHICH I ONCE FILLED WITH RUBBISH
3374-298025-0029 IT WAS WRITTEN IN A MOOD OF IMPATIENT LONGING DUE TO MY NOT FINDING YOU WHERE I MOST SURELY EXPECTED TO FIND YOU IN YOUR ROOM ON OUR SOFA IN THE HAPHAZARD WORDS SUGGESTED BY THE PEN YOU HAD LATELY BEEN USING
3374-298025-0030 THE SELECTION IS NOT DIFFICULT FOR SINCE AMONG THE DREAMY FANCIES WHICH ARE HERE CONFIDED TO YOU IN PERMANENT LETTERS THE RECOLLECTION OF THIS MOST BEAUTIFUL WORLD
3374-298025-0031 IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AND HAS A CERTAIN SORT OF RESEMBLANCE TO WHAT THEY CALL THOUGHT I CHOOSE IN PREFERENCE TO ANYTHING ELSE A DITHYRAMBIC FANTASY ON THE MOST LOVELY OF SITUATIONS
3374-298025-0032 FOR ONCE WE KNOW TO A CERTAINTY THAT WE LIVE IN A MOST BEAUTIFUL WORLD THE NEXT NEED IS OBVIOUS
3374-298026-0000 IT LOOKS AT ME JOYOUSLY OUT OF ITS DEEP EYES AND OPENS ITS ARMS TO EMBRACE MY SPIRIT
3374-298026-0001 THE HOLIEST AND MOST EVANESCENT OF THOSE DELICATE TRAITS AND UTTERANCES OF THE SOUL WHICH TO ONE WHO DOES NOT KNOW THE HIGHEST SEEM LIKE BLISS ITSELF
3374-298026-0002 ARE MERELY THE COMMON ATMOSPHERE OF OUR SPIRITUAL BREATH AND LIFE THE WORDS ARE WEAK AND VAGUE
3374-298026-0003 FURTHERMORE IN THIS THRONG OF IMPRESSIONS I COULD ONLY REPEAT ANEW THE ONE INEXHAUSTIBLE FEELING OF OUR ORIGINAL HARMONY A GREAT FUTURE BECKONS ME ON INTO THE IMMEASURABLE
3374-298026-0004 EACH IDEA DEVELOPS A COUNTLESS PROGENY
3374-298026-0005 I REMEMBER EVERYTHING EVEN THE GRIEFS AND ALL MY THOUGHTS THAT HAVE BEEN AND ARE TO BE
3374-298026-0006 THE BLOOD RUSHES WILDLY THROUGH MY SWOLLEN VEINS MY MOUTH THIRSTS FOR THE CONTACT OF YOUR LIPS AND MY FANCY SEEKS VAINLY AMONG THE MANY FORMS OF JOY FOR ONE
3374-298026-0007 WHICH MIGHT AT LAST GRATIFY MY DESIRE AND GIVE IT REST AND THEN AGAIN I SUDDENLY AND SADLY BETHINK ME OF THE GLOOMY TIME WHEN I WAS ALWAYS WAITING WITHOUT HOPE
3374-298026-0008 AND MADLY LOVING WITHOUT KNOWING IT WHEN MY INNERMOST BEING OVERFLOWED WITH A VAGUE LONGING WHICH IT BREATHED FORTH BUT RARELY IN HALF SUPPRESSED SIGHS
3374-298026-0009 OH I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT ALL A FAIRY TALE THAT THERE COULD BE SUCH JOY SUCH LOVE AS I NOW FEEL AND SUCH A WOMAN WHO COULD BE MY MOST TENDER BELOVED MY BEST COMPANION AND AT THE SAME TIME
3374-298026-0010 A PERFECT FRIEND FOR IT WAS IN FRIENDSHIP ESPECIALLY THAT I SOUGHT FOR WHAT I WANTED AND FOR WHAT I NEVER HOPED TO FIND IN ANY WOMAN IN YOU I FOUND IT ALL AND MORE THAN I COULD WISH FOR
3374-298026-0011 YOU KNOW NOTHING THE WOMANLINESS OF YOUR SOUL ASIDE FROM MINOR PECULIARITIES CONSISTS IN ITS REGARDING LIFE AND LOVE AS THE SAME THING FOR YOU ALL FEELING IS INFINITE AND ETERNAL
3374-298026-0012 YOU RECOGNIZE NO SEPARATIONS YOUR BEING IS AN INDIVISIBLE UNITY THAT IS WHY YOU ARE SO SERIOUS AND SO JOYOUS WHY YOU REGARD EVERYTHING IN SUCH A LARGE AND INDIFFERENT WAY
3374-298026-0013 THAT IS WHY YOU LOVE ME ALL OF ME AND WILL SURRENDER NO PART OF ME TO THE STATE TO POSTERITY OR TO MANLY PLEASURES I AM ALL YOURS WE ARE CLOSEST TO EACH OTHER
3374-298026-0014 AND WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER YOU ACCOMPANY ME THROUGH ALL THE STAGES OF MANHOOD FROM THE UTMOST WANTONNESS TO THE MOST REFINED SPIRITUALITY IN YOU ALONE I FIRST SAW TRUE PRIDE
3374-298026-0015 AND TRUE FEMININE HUMILITY THE MOST EXTREME SUFFERING IF IT IS ONLY SURROUNDED WITHOUT SEPARATING US
3374-298026-0016 WOULD SEEM TO ME NOTHING BUT A CHARMING ANTITHESIS TO THE SUBLIME FRIVOLITY OF OUR MARRIAGE WHY SHOULD WE NOT TAKE THE HARSHEST WHIM OF CHANCE FOR AN EXCELLENT JEST AND A MOST FROLICSOME CAPRICE SINCE WE
3374-298026-0017 LIKE OUR LOVE ARE IMMORTAL I CAN NO LONGER SAY MY LOVE AND YOUR LOVE THEY ARE BOTH ALIKE IN THEIR PERFECT MUTUALITY MARRIAGE IS THE EVERLASTING UNITY AND ALLIANCE OF OUR SPIRITS
3374-298026-0018 AS THAT LAST GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE WE DRANK TOGETHER WHEN I SAID AND SO LET US DRINK OUT THE REST OF OUR LIVES
3374-298026-0019 AND SO I SAY AGAIN LET US LIVE AND LOVE I KNOW YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO SURVIVE ME YOU WOULD RATHER FOLLOW YOUR DYING HUSBAND INTO HIS COFFIN GLADLY AND LOVINGLY WOULD YOU DESCEND INTO THE BURNING ABYSS
3374-298026-0020 EVEN AS THE WOMEN OF INDIA DO IMPELLED BY A MAD LAW THE CRUEL CONSTRAINING PURPOSE OF WHICH DESECRATES AND DESTROYS THE MOST DELICATE SANCTITIES OF THE WILL
3374-298026-0021 ON THE OTHER SIDE PERHAPS LONGING WILL BE MORE COMPLETELY REALIZED I OFTEN WONDER OVER IT EVERY THOUGHT AND WHATEVER ELSE IS FASHIONED WITHIN US
3374-298026-0022 SEEMS TO BE COMPLETE IN ITSELF AS SINGLE AND INDIVISIBLE AS A PERSON ONE THING CROWDS OUT ANOTHER AND THAT WHICH JUST NOW WAS NEAR AND PRESENT SOON SINKS BACK INTO OBSCURITY
3374-298026-0023 AND THEN AGAIN COME MOMENTS OF SUDDEN AND UNIVERSAL CLARITY WHEN SEVERAL SUCH SPIRITS OF THE INNER WORLD COMPLETELY FUSE TOGETHER INTO A WONDERFUL WEDLOCK AND MANY A FORGOTTEN BIT OF OUR EGO SHINES FORTH IN A NEW LIGHT
3374-298026-0024 AND EVEN ILLUMINATES THE DARKNESS OF THE FUTURE WITH ITS BRIGHT LUSTRE AS IT IS IN A SMALL WAY
3374-298026-0025 I THINK IN A LARGE WAY THAT WHICH WE CALL A LIFE IS FOR THE COMPLETE INNER IMMORTAL MAN ONLY A SINGLE IDEA AN INDIVISIBLE FEELING
3374-298026-0026 AND FOR HIM THERE COME TOO MOMENTS OF THE PROFOUNDEST AND FULLEST CONSCIOUSNESS WHEN ALL LIVES FALL TOGETHER AND MINGLE AND SEPARATE IN A DIFFERENT WAY
3374-298026-0027 THE TIME IS COMING WHEN WE TWO SHALL BEHOLD IN ONE SPIRIT THAT WE ARE BLOSSOMS OF ONE PLANT OR PETALS OF ONE FLOWER WE SHALL THEN KNOW WITH A SMILE
3374-298026-0028 THAT WHAT WE NOW CALL MERELY HOPE WAS REALLY MEMORY DO YOU KNOW HOW THE FIRST SEED OF THIS IDEA GERMINATED IN MY SOUL BEFORE YOU AND TOOK ROOT IN YOURS
3374-298026-0029 WEAVE OUR LOVE EVER AND EVER MORE CLOSELY AND FIRMLY TOGETHER JUST AS A CHILD LIKE AN ECHO DOUBLES THE HAPPINESS OF ITS GENTLE PARENTS NOTHING CAN PART US
3374-298026-0030 AND CERTAINLY ANY SEPARATION WOULD ONLY DRAW ME MORE POWERFULLY TO YOU I BETHINK ME HOW AT OUR LAST EMBRACE YOU VEHEMENTLY RESISTING I BURST INTO SIMULTANEOUS TEARS AND LAUGHTER
3374-298026-0031 I TRIED TO CALM MYSELF AND IN A SORT OF BEWILDERMENT I WOULD NOT BELIEVE THAT I WAS SEPARATED FROM YOU UNTIL THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS CONVINCED ME OF IT AGAINST MY WILL
3374-298026-0032 BUT THEN MY LONGING GREW AGAIN IRRESISTIBLE UNTIL ON ITS WINGS I SANK BACK INTO YOUR ARMS SUPPOSE WORDS OR A HUMAN BEING TO CREATE A MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN US
3374-298026-0033 THE POIGNANT GRIEF WOULD BE TRANSIENT AND QUICKLY RESOLVE ITSELF INTO COMPLETE HARMONY HOW COULD SEPARATION SEPARATE US WHEN PRESENCE ITSELF IS TO US AS IT WERE TOO PRESENT
3374-298026-0034 WE HAVE TO COOL AND MITIGATE THE CONSUMING FIRE WITH JESTS AND THUS FOR US THE MOST WITTY OF THE FORMS AND SITUATIONS OF JOY IS ALSO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
3374-298026-0035 IT IS NOT MERELY THE DELIGHT OF EXHAUSTION OR THE ANTICIPATION OF REVENGE I SEE IN IT A WONDERFUL AND PROFOUNDLY SIGNIFICANT ALLEGORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAN AND WOMAN
3374-298026-0036 INTO COMPLETE HUMANITY THAT WAS MY DITHYRAMBIC FANTASY ON THE LOVELIEST SITUATION IN THE LOVELIEST OF WORLDS I KNOW RIGHT WELL WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF IT
3374-298026-0037 AND HOW YOU TOOK IT AT THAT TIME AND I THINK I KNOW JUST AS WELL WHAT YOU WILL THINK OF IT AND HOW YOU WILL TAKE IT HERE HERE IN THIS LITTLE BOOK IN WHICH YOU EXPECT TO FIND GENUINE HISTORY PLAIN TRUTH AND CALM REASON
3374-298026-0038 YES EVEN MORALITY THE CHARMING MORALITY OF LOVE
3374-298026-0039 HOW CAN A MAN WISH TO WRITE ANYTHING WHICH IT IS SCARCELY PERMISSIBLE TO TALK ABOUT WHICH OUGHT ONLY TO BE FELT
3374-298026-0040 I REPLIED
3374-298026-0041 A MAN FEELS IT HE MUST WISH TO TALK ABOUT IT AND WHAT A MAN WISHES TO TALK ABOUT HE MAY WRITE
3374-298026-0042 I WANTED FIRST TO DEMONSTRATE TO YOU THAT THERE EXISTS IN THE ORIGINAL AND ESSENTIAL NATURE OF MAN A CERTAIN AWKWARD ENTHUSIASM WHICH LIKES TO UTTER BOLDLY THAT WHICH IS DELICATE AND HOLY
3374-298026-0043 AND SOMETIMES FALLS HEADLONG OVER ITS OWN HONEST ZEAL AND SPEAKS A WORD THAT IS DIVINE TO THE POINT OF COARSENESS THIS APOLOGY WOULD INDEED SAVE ME
3374-298026-0044 BUT PERHAPS ONLY AT THE ENORMOUS EXPENSE OF MY MANHOOD ITSELF FOR WHATEVER YOU MAY THINK OF MY MANHOOD IN PARTICULAR YOU HAVE NEVERTHELESS A GREAT DEAL AGAINST THE SEX IN GENERAL
3374-298026-0045 MEANTIME I WILL BY NO MEANS MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH THEM BUT WILL RATHER EXCUSE AND DEFEND MY LIBERTY AND AUDACITY BY MEANS OF THE EXAMPLE OF THE LITTLE INNOCENT WILHELMINA
3374-298026-0046 SINCE SHE TOO IS A LADY WHOM I LOVE MOST TENDERLY
3374-298032-0000 THE CHILDREN ARE JUSTIFIED WHEN THEY PEEP SO CURIOUSLY AND TIMIDLY AT A COMPANY OF UNKNOWN FACES EACH INDIVIDUAL ATOM OF EVERLASTING TIME IS CAPABLE OF COMPRISING A WORLD OF JOY
3374-298032-0001 AND AT THE SAME TIME OF OPENING UP A FATHOMLESS ABYSS OF PAIN AND SUFFERING
3374-298032-0002 I UNDERSTAND NOW THE OLD FAIRY TALE ABOUT THE MAN WHOM THE SORCERER ALLOWED TO LIVE A GREAT MANY YEARS IN A FEW MOMENTS FOR I KNOW BY MY OWN EXPERIENCE THE TERRIBLE OMNIPOTENCE OF THE FANTASY
3374-298032-0003 SINCE THE LAST LETTER FROM YOUR SISTER IT IS THREE DAYS NOW I HAVE UNDERGONE THE SUFFERINGS OF AN ENTIRE LIFE FROM THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT OF GLOWING YOUTH TO THE PALE MOONLIGHT OF SAGACIOUS OLD AGE
3374-298032-0004 EVERY LITTLE DETAIL SHE WROTE ABOUT YOUR SICKNESS TAKEN WITH WHAT I HAD ALREADY GLEANED FROM THE DOCTOR AND HAD OBSERVED MYSELF CONFIRMED MY SUSPICION THAT IT WAS FAR MORE DANGEROUS THAN YOU THOUGHT
3374-298032-0005 INDEED NO LONGER DANGEROUS BUT DECIDED PAST HOPE LOST IN THIS THOUGHT AND MY STRENGTH ENTIRELY EXHAUSTED ON ACCOUNT OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF HURRYING TO YOUR SIDE
3374-298032-0006 MY STATE OF MIND WAS REALLY VERY DISCONSOLATE NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME I UNDERSTAND WHAT IT REALLY WAS BEING NEW BORN BY THE JOYFUL NEWS THAT YOU ARE WELL AGAIN
3374-298032-0007 I DID NOT THINK OF IT AS ABOUT TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE OR EVEN IN THE PRESENT EVERYTHING WAS ALREADY PAST FOR A LONG TIME YOU HAD BEEN WRAPT IN THE BOSOM OF THE COLD EARTH
3374-298032-0008 FLOWERS HAD STARTED TO GROW ON THE BELOVED GRAVE AND MY TEARS HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO FLOW MORE GENTLY MUTE AND ALONE I STOOD AND SAW NOTHING BUT THE FEATURES I HAD LOVED AND THE SWEET GLANCES OF THE EXPRESSIVE EYES
3374-298032-0009 NOW AND THEN THE PALE FACE SMILED AND SEEMED ASLEEP JUST AS IT HAD LOOKED THE LAST TIME I SAW IT THEN OF A SUDDEN THE DIFFERENT MEMORIES ALL BECAME CONFUSED
3374-298032-0010 WITH UNBELIEVABLE RAPIDITY THE OUTLINES CHANGED REASSUMED THEIR FIRST FORM AND TRANSFORMED THEMSELVES AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL THE WILD VISION VANISHED
3374-298032-0011 ONLY YOUR HOLY EYES REMAINED IN THE EMPTY SPACE AND HUNG THERE MOTIONLESS EVEN AS THE FRIENDLY STARS SHINE ETERNALLY OVER OUR POVERTY
3374-298032-0012 NOW A PIERCING PAIN FROM DARK SUNS BURNED ME WITH AN INSUPPORTABLE GLARE NOW A BEAUTIFUL RADIANCE HOVERED ABOUT AS IF TO ENTICE ME THEN I SEEMED TO FEEL A FRESH BREATH OF MORNING AIR FAN ME
3374-298032-0013 I HELD MY HEAD UP AND CRIED ALOUD
3374-298032-0014 WHY SHOULD YOU TORMENT YOURSELF IN A FEW MINUTES YOU CAN BE WITH HER
3374-298032-0015 I WAS ALREADY HASTENING TO YOU WHEN SUDDENLY A NEW THOUGHT HELD ME BACK AND I SAID TO MY SPIRIT
3374-298032-0016 UNWORTHY MAN YOU CANNOT EVEN ENDURE THE TRIFLING DISSONANCES OF THIS ORDINARY LIFE AND YET YOU REGARD YOURSELF AS READY FOR AND WORTHY OF A HIGHER LIFE GO AWAY AND DO AND SUFFER AS YOUR CALLING IS
3374-298032-0017 AND THEN PRESENT YOURSELF AGAIN WHEN YOUR ORDERS HAVE BEEN EXECUTED
3374-298032-0018 IS IT NOT TO YOU ALSO REMARKABLE HOW EVERYTHING ON THIS EARTH MOVES TOWARD THE CENTRE HOW ORDERLY EVERYTHING IS HOW INSIGNIFICANT AND TRIVIAL SO IT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME
3374-298032-0019 AND FOR THAT REASON I SUSPECT IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN I HAVE ALREADY IMPARTED MY SUSPICION TO YOU THAT THE NEXT LIFE WILL BE LARGER AND IN THE GOOD AS WELL AS IN THE BAD STRONGER WILDER BOLDER AND MORE TREMENDOUS
3374-298032-0020 AS WHEN A PERSON SUDDENLY FINDS HIMSELF ALONE IN THE MIDST OF IMMEASURABLE MOUNTAINS OF ICE EVERYTHING ABOUT ME AND IN ME WAS COLD AND STRANGE AND EVEN MY TEARS FROZE
3374-298032-0021 WONDERFUL WORLDS APPEARED AND VANISHED BEFORE ME IN MY UNEASY DREAM I WAS SICK AND SUFFERED GREAT PAIN BUT I LOVED MY SICKNESS AND WELCOMED THE SUFFERING
3374-298032-0022 I HATED EVERYTHING EARTHLY AND WAS GLAD TO SEE IT ALL PUNISHED AND DESTROYED I FELT SO ALONE AND SO STRANGELY
3374-298032-0023 AND AS A DELICATE SPIRIT OFTEN GROWS MELANCHOLY IN THE VERY LAP OF HAPPINESS OVER ITS OWN JOY AND AT THE VERY ACME OF ITS EXISTENCE BECOMES CONSCIOUS OF THE FUTILITY OF IT ALL
3374-298032-0024 SO DID I REGARD MY SUFFERING WITH MYSTERIOUS PLEASURE I REGARDED IT AS THE SYMBOL OF LIFE IN GENERAL I BELIEVED THAT I WAS SEEING AND FEELING THE EVERLASTING DISCORD
3374-298032-0025 AND THE LOVELY FORMS OF REFINED CULTURE SEEMED DEAD AND TRIVIAL TO ME IN COMPARISON WITH THIS MONSTROUS WORLD OF INFINITE STRENGTH AND OF UNENDING STRUGGLE AND WARFARE
3374-298032-0026 EVEN INTO THE MOST HIDDEN DEPTHS OF EXISTENCE ON ACCOUNT OF THIS REMARKABLE FEELING SICKNESS ACQUIRED THE CHARACTER OF A PECULIAR WORLD COMPLETE IN ITSELF
3374-298032-0027 I FELT THAT ITS MYSTERIOUS LIFE WAS RICHER AND DEEPER THAN THE VULGAR HEALTH OF THE DREAMING SLEEP WALKERS ALL AROUND ME AND WITH THE SICKLINESS WHICH WAS NOT AT ALL UNPLEASANT
3374-298032-0028 THIS FEELING ALSO CLUNG TO ME AND COMPLETELY SEPARATED ME FROM OTHER MEN JUST AS I WAS SUNDERED FROM THE EARTH BY THE THOUGHT THAT YOUR NATURE AND MY LOVE HAD BEEN TOO SACRED
3374-298032-0029 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT ALL WAS RIGHT SO AND THAT YOUR UNAVOIDABLE DEATH WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A GENTLE AWAKENING AFTER A LIGHT SLEEP I TOO THOUGHT THAT I WAS AWAKE WHEN I SAW YOUR PICTURE
3374-298032-0030 WHICH EVERMORE TRANSFIGURED ITSELF INTO A CHEERFUL DIFFUSED PURITY SERIOUS AND YET CHARMING QUITE YOU AND YET NO LONGER YOU THE DIVINE FORM IRRADIATED BY A WONDERFUL LIGHT
3374-298032-0031 NOW IT WAS LIKE THE TERRIBLE GLEAM OF VISIBLE OMNIPOTENCE NOW LIKE A SOFT RAY OF GOLDEN CHILDHOOD
3374-298032-0032 BECAUSE EVERY EARTHLY SENTIMENT WAS ENTIRELY STRANGE TO ME AND THE FEELING NEVER LEFT ME THAT I WAS CONSECRATED TO DEATH
3374-298032-0033 THE YEARS PASSED SLOWLY BY AND DEEDS AND WORKS ADVANCED LABORIOUSLY TO THEIR GOAL ONE AFTER THE OTHER A GOAL THAT SEEMED AS LITTLE MINE AS THE DEEDS AND WORKS SEEMED TO BE WHAT THEY ARE CALLED
3374-298032-0034 TO ME THEY WERE MERELY HOLY SYMBOLS AND EVERYTHING BROUGHT ME BACK TO MY ONE BELOVED
3374-298032-0035 AND THE ONE ETERNAL AND INDIVISIBLE HUMANITY ALL EXISTENCE WAS AN UNINTERRUPTED DIVINE SERVICE OF SOLITARY LOVE
3374-298032-0036 FINALLY I BECAME CONSCIOUS THAT IT WAS NOW NEARLY OVER THE BROW WAS NO LONGER SMOOTH AND THE LOCKS WERE BECOMING GRAY MY CAREER WAS ENDED BUT NOT COMPLETED
3374-298032-0037 THE BEST STRENGTH OF LIFE WAS GONE AND STILL ART AND VIRTUE
3374-298032-0038 STOOD EVER UNATTAINABLE BEFORE ME I SHOULD HAVE DESPAIRED HAD I NOT PERCEIVED AND IDOLIZED BOTH IN YOU GRACIOUS MADONNA AND YOU AND YOUR GENTLE GODLINESS IN MYSELF
3374-298032-0039 THEN YOU APPEARED TO ME BECKONING WITH THE SUMMONS OF DEATH
3374-298032-0040 AN EARNEST LONGING FOR YOU AND FOR FREEDOM SEIZED ME I YEARNED FOR MY DEAR OLD FATHERLAND AND WAS ABOUT TO SHAKE OFF THE DUST OF TRAVEL WHEN I WAS SUDDENLY CALLED BACK TO LIFE BY THE PROMISE AND REASSURANCE OF YOUR RECOVERY
3374-298032-0041 AND ONLY IN THAT WAY DOES A HUMAN BEING BECOME ONE AND A COMPLETE ENTITY THAT IS BY REGARDING AND POETICALLY CONCEIVING HIMSELF AS THE CENTRE OF EVERYTHING AND THE SPIRIT OF THE WORLD
3374-298032-0042 BUT WHY POETICALLY CONCEIVE SINCE WE FIND THE GERM OF EVERYTHING IN OURSELVES AND YET REMAIN FOREVER ONLY A FRAGMENT OF OURSELVES
3436-172162-0000 THE ADVENTURE OF THE CART IT BEFELL IN THE MONTH OF MAY QUEEN GUENEVER CALLED TO HER KNIGHTS OF THE TABLE ROUND AND GAVE THEM WARNING THAT EARLY UPON THE MORROW SHE WOULD RIDE A MAYING INTO THE WOODS AND FIELDS BESIDE WESTMINSTER
3436-172162-0001 AND I WARN YOU THAT THERE BE NONE OF YOU BUT HE BE WELL HORSED AND THAT YE ALL BE CLOTHED IN GREEN EITHER SILK OR CLOTH AND I SHALL BRING WITH ME TEN LADIES AND EVERY KNIGHT SHALL HAVE A LADY BEHIND HIM
3436-172162-0002 AND EVERY KNIGHT SHALL HAVE A SQUIRE AND TWO YEOMAN AND ALL WELL HORSED FOR THUS IT CHANCED ONE MORN WHEN ALL THE COURT GREEN SUITED BUT WITH PLUMES THAT MOCK'D THE MAY HAD BEEN THEIR WONT A MAYING
3436-172162-0003 SO THEY MADE THEM READY AND THESE WERE THE NAMES OF THE KNIGHTS SIR KAY THE SENESCHAL SIR AGRIVAINE SIR BRANDILES SIR SAGRAMOUR LE DESIRUS
3436-172162-0004 SIR DODYNAS LE SAUVAGE SIR OZANNA SIR LADYNAS SIR PERSANT OF INDE SIR IRONSIDE AND SIR PELLEAS AND THESE TEN KNIGHTS MADE THEM READY
3436-172162-0005 SO UPON THE MORN THEY TOOK THEIR HORSES WITH THE QUEEN AND RODE A MAYING IN WOODS AND MEADOWS AS IT PLEASED THEM IN GREAT JOY AND DELIGHT NOW THERE WAS A KNIGHT
3436-172162-0006 SON TO KING BRADEMAGUS WHO LOVED QUEEN GUENEVER PASSING WELL AND SO HAD HE DONE LONG AND MANY YEARS NOW THIS KNIGHT SIR MALEAGANS LEARNED THE QUEEN'S PURPOSE AND THAT SHE HAD NO MEN OF ARMS WITH HER
3436-172162-0007 BUT THE TEN NOBLE KNIGHTS ALL ARRAYED IN GREEN FOR MAYING SO HE PREPARED HIM TWENTY MEN OF ARMS AND A HUNDRED ARCHERS TO TAKE CAPTIVE THE QUEEN AND HER KNIGHTS
3436-172162-0008 IN THE MERRY MONTH OF MAY IN A MORN AT BREAK OF DAY WITH A TROOP OF DAMSELS PLAYING THE QUEEN FORSOOTH WENT FORTH A MAYING OLD SONG SO WHEN THE QUEEN HAD MAYED
3436-172162-0009 TRAITOR KNIGHT SAID QUEEN GUENEVER WHAT WILT THOU DO WILT THOU SHAME THYSELF BETHINK THEE HOW THOU ART A KING'S SON AND A KNIGHT OF THE TABLE ROUND AND HOW THOU ART ABOUT TO DISHONOR ALL KNIGHTHOOD AND THYSELF
3436-172162-0010 BE IT AS IT MAY SAID SIR MALEAGANS KNOW YOU WELL MADAM I HAVE LOVED YOU MANY A YEAR AND NEVER TILL NOW COULD I GET YOU TO SUCH ADVANTAGE AS I DO NOW AND THEREFORE I WILL TAKE YOU AS I FIND YOU
3436-172162-0011 THEN THE TEN KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE DREW THEIR SWORDS AND THE OTHER PARTY RUN AT THEM WITH THEIR SPEARS
3436-172162-0012 THEN THEY LASHED TOGETHER WITH SWORDS TILL SEVERAL WERE SMITTEN TO THE EARTH SO WHEN THE QUEEN SAW HER KNIGHTS THUS DOLEFULLY OPPRESSED AND NEEDS MUST BE SLAIN AT THE LAST THEN FOR PITY AND SORROW SHE CRIED SIR MALEAGANS
3436-172162-0013 SLAY NOT MY NOBLE KNIGHTS AND I WILL GO WITH YOU UPON THIS COVENANT THAT
3436-172162-0014 MADAME SAID MALEAGANS FOR YOUR SAKE THEY SHALL BE LED WITH YOU INTO MY OWN CASTLE IF THAT YE WILL BE RULED AND RIDE WITH ME THEN SIR MALEAGANS CHARGED THEM ALL THAT NONE SHOULD DEPART FROM THE QUEEN
3436-172162-0015 FOR HE DREADED LEST SIR LAUNCELOT SHOULD HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT HAD BEEN DONE THEN THE QUEEN PRIVILY CALLED UNTO HER A PAGE OF HER CHAMBER THAT WAS SWIFTLY HORSED TO WHOM SHE SAID GO THOU WHEN THOU SEEST THY TIME
3436-172162-0016 AND BEAR THIS RING UNTO SIR LAUNCELOT AND PRAY HIM AS HE LOVETH ME THAT HE WILL SEE ME AND RESCUE ME AND SPARE NOT THY HORSE SAID THE QUEEN NEITHER FOR WATER NOR FOR LAND
3436-172162-0017 AND LIGHTLY HE TOOK HIS HORSE WITH THE SPURS AND DEPARTED AS FAST AS HE MIGHT AND WHEN SIR MALEAGANS SAW HIM SO FLEE HE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS BY THE QUEEN'S COMMANDMENT FOR TO WARN SIR LAUNCELOT
3436-172162-0018 THEN THEY THAT WERE BEST HORSED CHASED HIM AND SHOT AT HIM BUT THE CHILD WENT FROM THEM ALL THEN SIR MALEAGANS SAID TO THE QUEEN MADAM YE ARE ABOUT TO BETRAY ME BUT I SHALL ARRANGE FOR SIR LAUNCELOT THAT HE SHALL NOT COME LIGHTLY AT YOU
3436-172162-0019 THEN HE RODE WITH HER AND THEM ALL TO HIS CASTLE IN ALL THE HASTE THAT THEY MIGHT AND BY THE WAY SIR MALEAGANS LAID IN AMBUSH THE BEST ARCHERS THAT HE HAD TO WAIT FOR SIR LAUNCELOT
3436-172162-0020 AND THE CHILD CAME TO WESTMINSTER AND FOUND SIR LAUNCELOT AND TOLD HIS MESSAGE AND DELIVERED HIM THE QUEEN'S RING ALAS SAID SIR LAUNCELOT
3436-172162-0021 UNLESS I MAY RESCUE THAT NOBLE LADY THEN EAGERLY HE ASKED HIS ARMOR AND PUT IT ON HIM AND MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND RODE AS FAST AS HE MIGHT
3436-172162-0022 AND MEN SAY HE TOOK THE WATER AT WESTMINSTER BRIDGE AND MADE HIS HORSE SWIM OVER THAMES UNTO LAMBETH THEN WITHIN A WHILE HE CAME TO A WOOD WHERE WAS A NARROW WAY AND THERE THE ARCHERS WERE LAID IN AMBUSH
3436-172162-0023 AND THEY SHOT AT HIM AND SMOTE HIS HORSE SO THAT HE FELL THEN SIR LAUNCELOT LEFT HIS HORSE AND WENT ON FOOT BUT THERE LAY SO MANY DITCHES AND HEDGES BETWIXT THE ARCHERS AND HIM THAT HE MIGHT NOT MEDDLE WITH THEM
3436-172162-0024 ALAS FOR SHAME SAID SIR LAUNCELOT THAT EVER ONE KNIGHT SHOULD BETRAY ANOTHER BUT IT IS AN OLD SAW A GOOD MAN IS NEVER IN DANGER BUT WHEN HE IS IN DANGER OF A COWARD
3436-172162-0025 THEN SIR LAUNCELOT WENT AWHILE AND HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY CUMBERED BY HIS ARMOR HIS SHIELD AND HIS SPEAR AND ALL THAT BELONGED TO HIM THEN BY CHANCE THERE CAME BY HIM A CART THAT CAME THITHER TO FETCH WOOD
3436-172162-0026 CARTS WERE LITTLE USED EXCEPT FOR CARRYING OFFAL AND FOR CONVEYING CRIMINALS TO EXECUTION BUT SIR LAUNCELOT TOOK NO THOUGHT OF ANYTHING BUT THE NECESSITY OF HASTE FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESCUING THE QUEEN SO HE DEMANDED OF THE CARTER
3436-172162-0027 THAT HE SHOULD TAKE HIM IN AND CONVEY HIM AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE FOR A LIBERAL REWARD THE CARTER CONSENTED AND SIR LAUNCELOT PLACED HIMSELF IN THE CART AND ONLY LAMENTED THAT WITH MUCH JOLTING HE MADE BUT LITTLE PROGRESS
3436-172162-0028 HE DREW NEAR TO SEE WHO IT MIGHT BE THEN SIR LAUNCELOT TOLD HIM HOW THE QUEEN HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF AND HOW IN HASTENING TO HER RESCUE HIS HORSE HAD BEEN DISABLED AND HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO AVAIL HIMSELF OF THE CART RATHER THAN GIVE UP HIS ENTERPRISE
3436-172162-0029 THEN SIR GAWAIN SAID SURELY IT IS UNWORTHY OF A KNIGHT TO TRAVEL IN SUCH SORT BUT SIR LAUNCELOT HEEDED HIM NOT AT NIGHTFALL
3436-172162-0030 BUT TO ADMIT HIS COMPANION WHOM SHE SUPPOSED TO BE A CRIMINAL OR AT LEAST A PRISONER IT PLEASED HER NOT
3436-172162-0031 AT SUPPER SIR LAUNCELOT CAME NEAR BEING CONSIGNED TO THE KITCHEN
3436-172162-0032 NEITHER WOULD THE DAMSELS PREPARE A BED FOR HIM HE SEIZED THE FIRST HE FOUND UNOCCUPIED AND WAS LEFT UNDISTURBED NEXT MORNING HE SAW FROM THE TURRETS OF THE CASTLE A TRAIN ACCOMPANYING A LADY WHOM HE IMAGINED TO BE THE QUEEN
3436-172162-0033 THE LADY OF THE CASTLE SUPPLIED SIR LAUNCELOT WITH A HORSE AND THEY TRAVERSED THE PLAIN AT FULL SPEED THEY LEARNED FROM SOME TRAVELLERS WHOM THEY MET THAT THERE WERE TWO ROADS WHICH LED TO THE CASTLE OF SIR MALEAGANS HERE THEREFORE THE FRIENDS SEPARATED
3436-172162-0034 SIR LAUNCELOT FOUND HIS WAY BESET WITH OBSTACLES WHICH HE ENCOUNTERED SUCCESSFULLY BUT NOT WITHOUT MUCH LOSS OF TIME AS EVENING APPROACHED HE WAS MET BY A YOUNG AND SPORTIVE DAMSEL WHO GAYLY PROPOSED TO HIM A SUPPER
3436-172162-0035 AT HER CASTLE THE KNIGHT WHO WAS HUNGRY AND WEARY ACCEPTED THE OFFER THOUGH WITH NO VERY GOOD GRACE HE FOLLOWED THE LADY TO HER CASTLE AND ATE VORACIOUSLY OF HER SUPPER BUT WAS QUITE IMPENETRABLE TO ALL HER AMOROUS ADVANCES
3436-172162-0036 SUDDENLY THE SCENE CHANGED AND HE WAS ASSAILED BY SIX FURIOUS RUFFIANS WHOM HE DEALT WITH SO VIGOROUSLY THAT MOST OF THEM WERE SPEEDILY DISABLED WHEN AGAIN THERE WAS A CHANGE AND HE FOUND HIMSELF ALONE WITH HIS FAIR HOSTESS
3436-172162-0037 WHICH SHE TOLD HIM WOULD BY ITS CHANGES OF COLOR DISCLOSE TO HIM ALL ENCHANTMENTS AND ENABLE HIM TO SUBDUE THEM SIR LAUNCELOT PURSUED HIS JOURNEY WITHOUT BEING MUCH INCOMMODED EXCEPT BY THE TAUNTS OF TRAVELLERS
3436-172162-0038 WHO ALL SEEMED TO HAVE LEARNED BY SOME MEANS HIS DISGRACEFUL DRIVE IN THE CART ONE MORE INSOLENT THAN THE REST HAD THE AUDACITY TO INTERRUPT HIM DURING DINNER AND EVEN TO RISK A BATTLE IN SUPPORT OF HIS PLEASANTRY LAUNCELOT
3436-172162-0039 AFTER AN EASY VICTORY ONLY DOOMED HIM TO BE CARTED IN HIS TURN AT NIGHT HE WAS RECEIVED AT ANOTHER CASTLE WITH GREAT APPARENT HOSPITALITY BUT FOUND HIMSELF IN THE MORNING IN A DUNGEON AND LOADED WITH CHAINS
3436-172162-0040 CONSULTING HIS RING AND FINDING THAT THIS WAS AN ENCHANTMENT HE BURST HIS CHAINS SEIZED HIS ARMOR IN SPITE OF THE VISIONARY MONSTERS WHO ATTEMPTED TO DEFEND IT BROKE OPEN THE GATES OF THE TOWER AND CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY
3436-172162-0041 AT LENGTH HIS PROGRESS WAS CHECKED BY A WIDE AND RAPID TORRENT WHICH COULD ONLY BE PASSED ON A NARROW BRIDGE ON WHICH A FALSE STEP WOULD PROVE HIS DESTRUCTION LAUNCELOT LEADING HIS HORSE BY THE BRIDLE AND MAKING HIM SWIM BY HIS SIDE
3436-172162-0042 PASSED OVER THE BRIDGE AND WAS ATTACKED AS SOON AS HE REACHED THE BANK BY A LION AND A LEOPARD BOTH OF WHICH HE SLEW AND THEN EXHAUSTED AND BLEEDING SEATED HIMSELF ON THE GRASS AND ENDEAVORED TO BIND UP HIS WOUNDS
3436-172162-0043 OFFERED HIM HIS ASSISTANCE AND INFORMED HIM THAT THE QUEEN WAS SAFE IN HIS CASTLE BUT COULD ONLY BE RESCUED BY ENCOUNTERING MALEAGANS LAUNCELOT DEMANDED THE BATTLE FOR THE NEXT DAY AND ACCORDINGLY IT TOOK PLACE AT THE FOOT OF THE TOWER
3436-172162-0044 AND UNDER THE EYES OF THE FAIR CAPTIVE LAUNCELOT WAS ENFEEBLED BY HIS WOUNDS AND FOUGHT NOT WITH HIS USUAL SPIRIT AND THE CONTEST FOR A TIME WAS DOUBTFUL
3436-172162-0045 AH LAUNCELOT MY KNIGHT TRULY HAVE I BEEN TOLD THAT THOU ART NO LONGER WORTHY OF ME THESE WORDS INSTANTLY REVIVED THE DROOPING KNIGHT HE RESUMED AT ONCE HIS USUAL SUPERIORITY AND SOON LAID AT HIS FEET HIS HAUGHTY ADVERSARY
3436-172162-0046 MOVED BY THE ENTREATIES OF BRADEMAGUS ORDERED HIM TO WITHHOLD THE BLOW AND HE OBEYED THE CASTLE AND ITS PRISONERS WERE NOW AT HIS DISPOSAL LAUNCELOT HASTENED TO THE APARTMENT OF THE QUEEN THREW HIMSELF AT HER FEET
3436-172162-0047 AND WAS ABOUT TO KISS HER HAND WHEN SHE EXCLAIMED AH LAUNCELOT WHY DO I SEE THEE AGAIN YET FEEL THEE TO BE NO LONGER WORTHY OF ME AFTER HAVING BEEN DISGRACEFULLY DRAWN ABOUT THE COUNTRY IN A SHE HAD NOT TIME TO FINISH THE PHRASE
3436-172162-0048 FOR HER LOVER SUDDENLY STARTED FROM HER AND BITTERLY LAMENTING THAT HE HAD INCURRED THE DISPLEASURE OF HIS SOVEREIGN LADY RUSHED OUT OF THE CASTLE THREW HIS SWORD AND HIS SHIELD TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT RAN FURIOUSLY INTO THE WOODS AND DISAPPEARED
3436-172162-0049 IT SEEMS THAT THE STORY OF THE ABOMINABLE CART WHICH HAUNTED LAUNCELOT AT EVERY STEP HAD REACHED THE EARS OF SIR KAY WHO HAD TOLD IT TO THE QUEEN AS A PROOF THAT HER KNIGHT MUST HAVE BEEN DISHONORED
3436-172162-0050 THREE DAYS ELAPSED DURING WHICH LAUNCELOT WANDERED WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE HE WENT TILL AT LAST HE BEGAN TO REFLECT THAT HIS MISTRESS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN DECEIVED BY MISREPRESENTATION
3436-172162-0051 AND THAT IT WAS HIS DUTY TO SET HER RIGHT HE THEREFORE RETURNED COMPELLED MALEAGANS TO RELEASE HIS PRISONERS
3436-172162-0052 HAD THE SATISFACTION OF MEETING HIM THE NEXT DAY
3436-172171-0000 WHERE HE WAS BROUGHT UP IN TOTAL IGNORANCE OF ARMS AND CHIVALRY HE WAS ALLOWED NO WEAPON
3436-172171-0001 WHICH WAS THE ONLY THING OF ALL HER LORDES FAIRE GERE THAT HIS MOTHER CARRIED TO THE WOOD WITH HER IN THE USE OF THIS HE BECAME SO SKILFUL THAT HE COULD KILL WITH IT
3436-172171-0002 NOT ONLY THE ANIMALS OF THE CHASE FOR THE TABLE BUT EVEN BIRDS ON THE WING AT LENGTH HOWEVER PERCEVAL WAS ROUSED TO A DESIRE OF MILITARY RENOWN BY SEEING IN THE FOREST FIVE KNIGHTS WHO WERE IN COMPLETE ARMOR
3436-172171-0003 HE SAID TO HIS MOTHER MOTHER WHAT ARE THOSE YONDER THEY ARE ANGELS MY SON SAID SHE BY MY FAITH I WILL GO AND BECOME AN ANGEL WITH THEM AND PERCEVAL WENT TO THE ROAD AND MET THEM
3436-172171-0004 TELL ME GOOD LAD SAID ONE OF THEM SAWEST THOU A KNIGHT PASS THIS WAY EITHER TODAY OR YESTERDAY
3436-172171-0005 SUCH AN ONE AS I AM SAID THE KNIGHT IF THOU WILT TELL ME WHAT I ASK THEE I WILL TELL THEE WHAT THOU ASKEST ME GLADLY WILL I DO SO SAID SIR OWAIN FOR THAT WAS THE KNIGHT'S NAME
3436-172171-0006 AND PERCEVAL IN RETURN GAVE HIM SUCH INFORMATION AS HE HAD THEN PERCEVAL RETURNED TO HIS MOTHER AND SAID TO HER MOTHER THOSE WERE NOT ANGELS BUT HONORABLE KNIGHTS THEN HIS MOTHER SWOONED AWAY
3436-172171-0007 AND PERCEVAL WENT TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY KEPT THE HORSES THAT CARRIED FIREWOOD AND PROVISIONS FOR THE CASTLE AND HE TOOK A BONY PIEBALD HORSE WHICH SEEMED TO HIM THE STRONGEST OF THEM AND HE PRESSED A PACK INTO THE FORM OF A SADDLE
3436-172171-0008 AND WITH TWISTED TWIGS HE IMITATED THE TRAPPINGS WHICH HE HAD SEEN UPON THE HORSES WHEN HE CAME AGAIN TO HIS MOTHER THE COUNTESS HAD RECOVERED FROM HER SWOON MY SON SAID SHE DESIREST THOU TO RIDE FORTH
3436-172171-0009 YES WITH THY LEAVE SAID HE GO FORWARD THEN SHE SAID TO THE COURT OF ARTHUR WHERE THERE ARE THE BEST AND THE NOBLEST AND THE MOST BOUNTIFUL OF MEN AND TELL HIM THOU ART PERCEVAL THE SON OF PELENORE
3436-172171-0010 AND ASK OF HIM TO BESTOW KNIGHTHOOD ON THEE AND WHENEVER THOU SEEST A CHURCH REPEAT THERE THY PATER NOSTER
3436-172171-0011 FOR THUS SHALT THOU ACQUIRE FAME YET FREELY GIVE IT TO ANOTHER FOR THUS THOU SHALT OBTAIN PRAISE IF THOU SEE A FAIR WOMAN PAY COURT TO HER FOR THUS THOU WILT OBTAIN LOVE
3436-172171-0012 PERCEIVING IN ONE CORNER OF THE TENT SOME FOOD TWO FLASKS FULL OF WINE AND SOME BOAR'S FLESH ROASTED HE SAID MY MOTHER TOLD ME WHENEVER I SAW MEAT AND DRINK TO TAKE IT
3436-172171-0013 AND HE ATE GREEDILY FOR HE WAS VERY HUNGRY THE MAIDEN SAID SIR THOU HADST BEST GO QUICKLY FROM HERE FOR FEAR THAT MY FRIENDS SHOULD COME AND EVIL SHOULD BEFALL YOU BUT PERCEVAL SAID
3436-172171-0014 AND HE GAVE THE MAIDEN HIS OWN RING IN EXCHANGE FOR HERS THEN HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND RODE AWAY PERCEVAL JOURNEYED ON TILL HE ARRIVED AT ARTHUR'S COURT AND IT SO HAPPENED
3436-172171-0015 FOR WHEN HER PAGE WAS SERVING THE QUEEN WITH A GOLDEN GOBLET THIS KNIGHT STRUCK THE ARM OF THE PAGE AND DASHED THE WINE IN THE QUEEN'S FACE AND OVER HER STOMACHER THEN HE SAID
3436-172171-0016 LET HIM FOLLOW ME TO THE MEADOW SO THE KNIGHT TOOK HIS HORSE AND RODE TO THE MEADOW CARRYING AWAY THE GOLDEN GOBLET AND ALL THE HOUSEHOLD HUNG DOWN THEIR HEADS AND NO ONE OFFERED TO FOLLOW THE KNIGHT TO TAKE VENGEANCE UPON HIM
3436-172171-0017 FOR IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT NO ONE WOULD HAVE VENTURED ON SO DARING AN OUTRAGE UNLESS HE POSSESSED SUCH POWERS THROUGH MAGIC OR CHARMS THAT NONE COULD BE ABLE TO PUNISH HIM JUST THEN BEHOLD
3436-172171-0018 PERCEVAL ENTERED THE HALL UPON THE BONY PIEBALD HORSE WITH HIS UNCOUTH TRAPPINGS IN THE CENTRE OF THE HALL STOOD KAY THE SENESCHAL TELL ME TALL MAN SAID PERCEVAL IS THAT ARTHUR YONDER
3436-172171-0019 WHAT WOULDST THOU WITH ARTHUR ASKED KAY MY MOTHER TOLD ME TO GO TO ARTHUR AND RECEIVE KNIGHTHOOD FROM HIM BY MY FAITH SAID HE THOU ART ALL TOO MEANLY EQUIPPED WITH HORSE AND WITH ARMS
3436-172171-0020 THEN ALL THE HOUSEHOLD BEGAN TO JEER AND LAUGH AT HIM BUT THERE WAS A CERTAIN DAMSEL WHO HAD BEEN A WHOLE YEAR AT ARTHUR'S COURT
3436-172171-0021 AND THE KING'S FOOL FOOTNOTE A FOOL WAS A COMMON APPENDAGE OF THE COURTS OF THOSE DAYS WHEN THIS ROMANCE WAS WRITTEN A FOOL WAS THE ORNAMENT HELD IN NEXT ESTIMATION TO A DWARF HE WORE A WHITE DRESS WITH A YELLOW BONNET
3436-172171-0022 AND CARRIED A BELL OR BAWBLE IN HIS HAND THOUGH CALLED A FOOL HIS WORDS WERE OFTEN WEIGHED AND REMEMBERED AS IF THERE WERE A SORT OF ORACULAR MEANING IN THEM
3436-172171-0023 TILL SHE HAD SEEN HIM WHO WOULD BE THE FLOWER OF CHIVALRY NOW THIS DAMSEL CAME UP TO PERCEVAL AND TOLD HIM SMILING THAT IF HE LIVED HE WOULD BE ONE OF THE BRAVEST AND BEST OF KNIGHTS TRULY SAID KAY
3436-172171-0024 THOU ART ILL TAUGHT TO REMAIN A YEAR AT ARTHUR'S COURT WITH CHOICE OF SOCIETY AND SMILE ON NO ONE AND NOW BEFORE THE FACE OF ARTHUR AND ALL HIS KNIGHTS TO CALL SUCH A MAN AS THIS THE FLOWER OF KNIGHTHOOD
3436-172171-0025 THAT SHE FELL SENSELESS TO THE GROUND THEN SAID KAY TO PERCEVAL GO AFTER THE KNIGHT WHO WENT HENCE TO THE MEADOW OVERTHROW HIM AND RECOVER THE GOLDEN GOBLET AND POSSESS THYSELF OF HIS HORSE AND ARMS AND THOU SHALT HAVE KNIGHTHOOD
3436-172171-0026 I WILL DO SO TALL MAN SAID PERCEVAL SO HE TURNED HIS HORSE'S HEAD TOWARD THE MEADOW AND WHEN HE CAME THERE THE KNIGHT WAS RIDING UP AND DOWN PROUD OF HIS STRENGTH AND VALOR AND NOBLE MIEN TELL ME SAID THE KNIGHT
3436-172171-0027 DIDST THOU SEE ANY ONE COMING AFTER ME FROM THE COURT
3436-172171-0028 AND TO TAKE FROM THEE THE GOBLET AND THY HORSE AND ARMOR FOR MYSELF SILENCE SAID THE KNIGHT GO BACK TO THE COURT AND TELL ARTHUR EITHER TO COME HIMSELF
3436-172171-0029 AND UNLESS HE DO SO QUICKLY I WILL NOT WAIT FOR HIM BY MY FAITH SAID PERCEVAL CHOOSE THOU WHETHER IT SHALL BE WILLINGLY OR UNWILLINGLY FOR I WILL HAVE THE HORSE AND THE ARMS AND THE GOBLET
3436-172171-0030 UPON THIS THE KNIGHT RAN AT HIM FURIOUSLY AND STRUCK HIM A VIOLENT BLOW WITH THE SHAFT OF HIS SPEAR
3436-172171-0031 MY MOTHER'S SERVANTS WERE NOT USED TO PLAY WITH ME IN THIS WISE SO THUS WILL I PLAY WITH THEE AND HE THREW AT HIM ONE OF HIS SHARP POINTED STICKS AND IT STRUCK HIM IN THE EYE AND CAME OUT AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD SO THAT HE FELL DOWN LIFELESS
3436-172171-0032 VERILY SAID SIR OWAIN THE SON OF URIEN TO KAY THE SENESCHAL THOU WAST ILL ADVISED TO SEND THAT MADMAN AFTER THE KNIGHT FOR HE MUST EITHER BE OVERTHROWN OR FLEE AND EITHER WAY IT WILL BE A DISGRACE TO ARTHUR AND HIS WARRIORS
3436-172171-0033 THEREFORE WILL I GO TO SEE WHAT HAS BEFALLEN HIM SO SIR OWAIN WENT TO THE MEADOW AND HE FOUND PERCEVAL TRYING IN VAIN TO GET THE DEAD KNIGHT'S ARMOR OFF IN ORDER TO CLOTHE HIMSELF WITH IT
3436-172171-0034 SIR OWAIN UNFASTENED THE ARMOR AND HELPED PERCEVAL TO PUT IT ON AND TAUGHT HIM HOW TO PUT HIS FOOT IN THE STIRRUP AND USE THE SPUR
3436-172171-0035 AND URGED ON HIS HORSE WITH A STICK THEN OWAIN WOULD HAVE HAD HIM RETURN TO THE COURT TO RECEIVE THE PRAISE THAT WAS HIS DUE BUT PERCEVAL SAID I WILL NOT COME TO THE COURT TILL I HAVE ENCOUNTERED THE TALL MAN THAT IS THERE
3436-172171-0036 TO REVENGE THE INJURY HE DID TO THE MAIDEN BUT TAKE THOU THE GOBLET TO QUEEN GUENEVER AND TELL KING ARTHUR THAT WHEREVER I AM I WILL BE HIS VASSAL AND WILL DO HIM WHAT PROFIT AND SERVICE I CAN AND SIR OWAIN
3436-172171-0037 WENT BACK TO THE COURT AND RELATED ALL THESE THINGS TO ARTHUR AND GUENEVER AND TO ALL THE HOUSEHOLD
3436-172171-0038 AND HE CAME TO A LAKE ON THE SIDE OF WHICH WAS A FAIR CASTLE AND ON THE BORDER OF THE LAKE HE SAW A HOARY HEADED MAN SITTING UPON A VELVET CUSHION AND HIS ATTENDANTS WERE FISHING IN THE LAKE
3436-172171-0039 WHEN THE HOARY HEADED MAN BEHELD PERCEVAL APPROACHING HE AROSE AND WENT INTO THE CASTLE PERCEVAL RODE TO THE CASTLE AND THE DOOR WAS OPEN AND HE ENTERED THE HALL
3436-172171-0040 AND THE HOARY HEADED MAN RECEIVED PERCEVAL COURTEOUSLY AND ASKED HIM TO SIT BY HIM ON THE CUSHION WHEN IT WAS TIME THE TABLES WERE SET AND THEY WENT TO MEAT AND WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED THEIR MEAT THE HOARY HEADED MAN ASKED PERCEVAL
3436-172171-0041 IF HE KNEW HOW TO FIGHT WITH THE SWORD I KNOW NOT SAID PERCEVAL BUT WERE I TO BE TAUGHT DOUBTLESS I SHOULD AND THE HOARY HEADED MAN SAID TO HIM I AM THY UNCLE THY MOTHER'S BROTHER I AM CALLED KING PECHEUR
3436-172171-0042 FOOTNOTE THE WORD MEANS BOTH FISHER AND SINNER THOU SHALT REMAIN WITH ME A SPACE IN ORDER TO LEARN THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND COURTESY AND NOBLE BEARING AND THIS DO THOU REMEMBER
3436-172171-0043 IF THOU SEEST AUGHT TO CAUSE THY WONDER ASK NOT THE MEANING OF IT IF NO ONE HAS THE COURTESY TO INFORM THEE THE REPROACH WILL NOT FALL UPON THEE BUT UPON ME THAT AM THY TEACHER
3436-172171-0044 WHILE PERCEVAL AND HIS UNCLE DISCOURSED TOGETHER PERCEVAL BEHELD TWO YOUTHS ENTER THE HALL BEARING A GOLDEN CUP AND A SPEAR OF MIGHTY SIZE WITH BLOOD DROPPING FROM ITS POINT TO THE GROUND
3436-172171-0045 AND WHEN ALL THE COMPANY SAW THIS THEY BEGAN TO WEEP AND LAMENT BUT FOR ALL THAT THE MAN DID NOT BREAK OFF HIS DISCOURSE WITH PERCEVAL AND AS HE DID NOT TELL HIM THE MEANING OF WHAT HE SAW HE FOREBORE TO ASK HIM CONCERNING IT
3436-172171-0046 NOW THE CUP THAT PERCEVAL SAW WAS THE SANGREAL AND THE SPEAR THE SACRED SPEAR AND AFTERWARDS KING PECHEUR REMOVED WITH THOSE SACRED RELICS INTO A FAR COUNTRY ONE EVENING
3436-172171-0047 PERCEVAL ENTERED A VALLEY AND CAME TO A HERMIT'S CELL AND THE HERMIT WELCOMED HIM GLADLY AND THERE HE SPENT THE NIGHT AND IN THE MORNING HE AROSE AND WHEN HE WENT FORTH BEHOLD A SHOWER OF SNOW HAD FALLEN IN THE NIGHT AND A HAWK
3436-172171-0048 HAD KILLED A WILD FOWL IN FRONT OF THE CELL AND THE NOISE OF THE HORSE HAD SCARED THE HAWK AWAY AND A RAVEN ALIGHTED ON THE BIRD AND PERCEVAL STOOD AND COMPARED THE BLACKNESS OF THE RAVEN AND THE WHITENESS OF THE SNOW
3436-172171-0049 TO THE HAIR OF THE LADY THAT BEST HE LOVED WHICH WAS BLACKER THAN JET AND TO HER SKIN WHICH WAS WHITER THAN THE SNOW AND TO THE TWO RED SPOTS UPON HER CHEEKS WHICH WERE REDDER THAN THE BLOOD UPON THE SNOW
3436-172171-0050 NOW ARTHUR AND HIS HOUSEHOLD WERE IN SEARCH OF PERCEVAL AND BY CHANCE THEY CAME THAT WAY KNOW YE SAID ARTHUR WHO IS THE KNIGHT WITH THE LONG SPEAR THAT STANDS BY THE BROOK UP YONDER LORD SAID ONE OF THEM
3436-172171-0051 I WILL GO AND LEARN WHO HE IS
3436-172171-0052 AND WHO HE WAS BUT PERCEVAL WAS SO INTENT UPON HIS THOUGHT THAT HE GAVE HIM NO ANSWER THEN THE YOUTH THRUST AT PERCEVAL WITH HIS LANCE AND PERCEVAL TURNED UPON HIM AND STRUCK HIM TO THE GROUND
3436-172171-0053 AND WHEN THE YOUTH RETURNED TO THE KING AND TOLD HOW RUDELY HE HAD BEEN TREATED SIR KAY SAID I WILL GO MYSELF AND WHEN HE GREETED PERCEVAL AND GOT NO ANSWER HE SPOKE TO HIM RUDELY AND ANGRILY
3436-172171-0054 AND PERCEVAL THRUST AT HIM WITH HIS LANCE AND CAST HIM DOWN SO THAT HE BROKE HIS ARM AND HIS SHOULDER BLADE AND WHILE HE LAY THUS STUNNED HIS HORSE RETURNED BACK AT A WILD AND PRANCING PACE THEN SAID

3436-172171-0057 AND PERCEVAL WAS RESTING ON THE SHAFT OF HIS SPEAR PONDERING THE SAME THOUGHT
3436-172171-0058 IF I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AS AGREEABLE TO THEE AS IT WOULD BE TO ME I WOULD CONVERSE WITH THEE I HAVE ALSO A MESSAGE FROM ARTHUR UNTO THEE TO PRAY THEE TO COME AND VISIT HIM
3436-172171-0059 AND TWO MEN HAVE BEEN BEFORE ON THIS ERRAND THAT IS TRUE SAID PERCEVAL AND UNCOURTEOUSLY THEY CAME THEY ATTACKED ME AND I WAS ANNOYED THEREAT THEN HE TOLD HIM THE THOUGHT THAT OCCUPIED HIS MIND

3440-171006-0000 IN THAT HOUR JESUS REJOICED IN SPIRIT AND SAID I THANK THEE O FATHER LORD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH THAT THOU HAST HID THESE THINGS FROM THE WISE AND PRUDENT AND HAST REVEALED THEM UNTO BABES EVEN SO FATHER FOR SO IT SEEMED GOOD IN THY SIGHT
3440-171006-0001 SAYS THE APOSTLE PAUL I SAY THE TRUTH IN CHRIST I LIE NOT MY CONSCIENCE ALSO BEARING ME WITNESS IN THE HOLY GHOST THAT I HAVE GREAT HEAVINESS AND CONTINUAL SORROW IN MY HEART
3440-171006-0002 MY KINSMEN ACCORDING TO THE FLESH BRETHREN MY HEART'S DESIRE AND PRAYER TO GOD FOR ISRAEL IS THAT THEY MIGHT BE SAVED AND SUCH DEAR READER IS IN GREATER OR LESS DEGREE THE FEELING OF EVERY RENEWED HEART
3440-171006-0003 LOVING JESUS IT WOULD FAIN HAVE OTHERS LOVE HIM TOO IT DESIRES THE SALVATION OF ALL BUT FOR THAT OF ITS OWN DEAR ONES IT LONGS AND LABORS AND PRAYS IT IS LIKE JACOB WRESTLING WITH THE ANGEL WHEN HE SAID
3440-171006-0004 I WILL NOT LET THEE GO EXCEPT THOU BLESS ME AND THUS IT WAS WITH ELSIE SHE KNEW NOW THAT HER FATHER WAS NOT A CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO REAL LOVE FOR JESUS NONE OF THE TRUE FEAR OF GOD BEFORE HIS EYES
3440-171006-0005 SHE SAW THAT IF HE PERMITTED HER TO READ TO HIM FROM GOD'S WORD AS HE SOMETIMES DID IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY PLEASURE IN LISTENING BUT ONLY TO PLEASE HER SHE HAD NO REASON TO SUPPOSE HE EVER PRAYED AND THOUGH HE WENT REGULARLY TO CHURCH
3440-171006-0006 IT WAS BECAUSE HE CONSIDERED IT PROPER AND RESPECTABLE TO DO SO AND NOT THAT HE CARED TO WORSHIP GOD OR TO LEARN HIS WILL THIS CONVICTION WHICH HAD GRADUALLY DAWNED UPON ELSIE UNTIL NOW IT AMOUNTED TO CERTAINTY CAUSED HER GREAT GRIEF
3440-171006-0007 SHE SHED MANY TEARS OVER IT IN SECRET AND VERY MANY AND VERY EARNEST WERE THE PRAYERS SHE OFFERED UP FOR HER DEAR FATHER'S CONVERSION SHE WAS SITTING ON HIS KNEE ONE EVENING IN THE DRAWING ROOM WHILE HE AND SEVERAL OTHER GENTLEMEN WERE CONVERSING ON THE SUBJECT OF RELIGION
3440-171006-0008 THEY WERE DISCUSSING THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO A CHANGE OF HEART WERE NECESSARY TO SALVATION THE GENERAL OPINION SEEMED TO BE THAT IT WAS NOT AND ELSIE LISTENED WITH PAIN WHILE HER FATHER EXPRESSED HIS DECIDED CONVICTION THAT ALL WHO LED AN HONEST UPRIGHT MORAL LIFE
3440-171006-0009 AND ATTENDED TO THE OUTWARD OBSERVANCES OF RELIGION WERE QUITE SAFE HE COULD SEE NO NECESSITY FOR A CHANGE OF HEART HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE DOCTRINE OF TOTAL DEPRAVITY NOT HE NO INDEED HE THOUGHT THE WORLD MUCH BETTER THAN MANY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE
3440-171006-0010 ELSIE FIXED HER EYES ON HIS FACE WITH A VERY MOURNFUL GAZE WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING BUT HE WAS BUSY WITH HIS ARGUMENT AND DID NOT NOTICE HER BUT ONE OF THE GUESTS WAS JUST EXPRESSING HIS APPROVAL OF MISTER DINSMORE'S SENTIMENTS WHEN CATCHING SIGHT OF ELSIE'S FACE
3440-171006-0011 HE STOPPED REMARKING YOUR LITTLE GIRL LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ON THE SUBJECT WHAT IS IT MY DEAR ELSIE BLUSHED HESITATED AND LOOKED AT HER FATHER YES SPEAK MY DAUGHTER IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY HE SAID ENCOURAGINGLY ELSIE LIFTED
3440-171006-0012 MARVEL NOT THAT I SAID UNTO THEE YE MUST BE BORN AGAIN SHE REPEATED THESE WORDS OF INSPIRATION WITH A DEEP EARNEST SOLEMNITY THAT SEEMED TO IMPRESS EVERY HEARER FOR A MOMENT THERE WAS A DEEP HUSH IN THE ROOM THEN THE GENTLEMAN ASKED
3440-171006-0013 CREATE IN ME A CLEAN HEART O GOD AND RENEW A RIGHT SPIRIT WITHIN ME WHERE DID YOU LEARN ALL THIS HE ASKED LOOKING AT HER WITH MINGLED SURPRISE AND ADMIRATION IN THE BIBLE SIR SHE MODESTLY REPLIED YOU SEEM TO HAVE READ IT TO SOME PURPOSE SAID HE
3440-171006-0014 AND NOW SINCE YOU CONSIDER THAT CHANGE SO NECESSARY CAN YOU TELL ME HOW IT IS TO BE BROUGHT ABOUT GOD'S HOLY SPIRIT ALONE CAN CHANGE A SINNER'S HEART SIR AND HOW AM I TO SECURE HIS AID HE ASKED ELSIE ANSWERED WITH A TEXT
3440-171006-0015 SHE REPLIED THE SWEET LITTLE FACE ALL SUFFUSED WITH BLUSHES AND THE SOFT DOWNCAST EYES FILLING WITH TEARS WHY DO YOU THINK SO HE ASKED AGAIN
3440-171006-0016 I THINK THERE IS A TEXT THAT SAYS YOU MUST BE ABLE ALWAYS TO GIVE A REASON FOR THE HOPE THAT IS IN YOU OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT IS THERE NOT YES SIR BE READY ALWAYS TO GIVE AN ANSWER TO EVERY MAN THAT ASKETH YOU A REASON OF THE HOPE THAT IS IN YOU
3440-171006-0017 WITH MEEKNESS AND FEAR THEN RAISING HER EYES TO HIS FACE WITH A TOUCHING MIXTURE OF DEEP HUMILITY AND HOLY BOLDNESS SHE CONTINUED AND THIS SIR IS MY ANSWER JESUS SAYS HIM THAT COMETH UNTO ME I WILL IN NO WISE CAST OUT
3440-171006-0018 AND I BELIEVE HIM I DID GO TO HIM AND HE DID NOT CAST ME OUT BUT FORGAVE MY SINS AND TAUGHT ME TO LOVE HIM AND DESIRE TO SERVE HIM ALL MY LIFE THIS CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE GENTLEMAN AND THE LITTLE GIRL HAD DRAWN THE ATTENTION OF ALL PRESENT
3440-171006-0019 AND NOW MISSUS DINSMORE WHO HAD MORE THAN ONCE SHOWN SIGNS OF IMPATIENCE SAID WELL ELSIE I THINK YOU HAVE NOW TALKED QUITE ENOUGH FOR A CHILD OF YOUR AGE THEN PULLING OUT HER WATCH IT IS HIGH TIME FOR LITTLE FOLKS TO BE IN BED ELSIE

3440-171006-0021 WHISPERED ELSIE WHO HAD A GREAT DREAD OF MISSUS DINSMORE'S ANGER VERY WELL THEN YOU MAY DO AS YOU LIKE HE REPLIED GIVING HER A GOOD NIGHT KISS AND WITH A GRACEFUL GOOD NIGHT TO THE COMPANY THE LITTLE GIRL LEFT THE ROOM
3440-171006-0022 HER QUESTIONER FOLLOWED HER WITH AN ADMIRING GLANCE THEN TURNING TO HER FATHER EXCLAIMED WARMLY SHE IS A REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT CHILD DINSMORE ONE THAT ANY FATHER MIGHT BE PROUD OF I WAS ASTONISHED AT HER ANSWERS

3440-171009-0082 THAT ELSIE WAS VERY MUCH SURPRISED WHEN HER FATHER CALLED HER TO GO TO BED IS IT HALF PAST NINE ALREADY PAPA SHE ASKED
3486-166424-0000 AS I GAZED UPON THEM I WONDERED TO WHAT SECRET PLACE WITHIN THEIR BROODING IMMENSITIES THE LITTLE METAL MYSTERIES HAD FLED AND TO WHAT MYRIADS IT MIGHT BE OF THEIR KIND
3486-166424-0001 OF WHAT POWERS SMALL LIKE THESE OR OR QUICK ON THE SCREEN OF MY MIND FLASHED TWO PICTURES SIDE BY SIDE
3486-166424-0002 THE LITTLE FOUR RAYED PRINT IN THE GREAT DUST OF THE CRUMBLING RUIN AND ITS COLOSSAL TWIN ON THE BREAST OF THE POPPIED VALLEY I TURNED ASIDE CREPT THROUGH THE SHATTERED PORTAL AND LOOKED OVER THE HAUNTED HOLLOW UNBELIEVING I RUBBED MY EYES
3486-166424-0003 THEN LEAPED TO THE VERY BRIM OF THE BOWL A LARK HAD RISEN FROM THE ROOF OF ONE OF THE SHATTERED HEAPS AND HAD FLOWN CAROLING UP INTO THE SHADOWY SKY A FLOCK OF THE LITTLE WILLOW WARBLERS FLUNG THEMSELVES ACROSS THE VALLEY SCOLDING AND GOSSIPING
3486-166424-0004 A HARE SAT UPRIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ANCIENT ROADWAY THE VALLEY ITSELF LAY SERENELY UNDER THE AMBERING LIGHT SMILING PEACEFUL EMPTIED OF HORROR
3486-166424-0005 I DROPPED OVER THE SIDE WALKED CAUTIOUSLY DOWN THE ROAD UP WHICH BUT AN HOUR OR SO BEFORE WE HAD STRUGGLED SO DESPERATELY PACED FARTHER AND FARTHER WITH AN INCREASING CONFIDENCE AND A GROWING WONDER
3486-166424-0006 GONE WAS THAT SOUL OF LONELINESS VANISHED THE WHIRLPOOL OF DESPAIR THAT HAD STRIVEN TO DRAG US DOWN TO DEATH THE BOWL WAS NOTHING BUT A QUIET SMILING LOVELY LITTLE HOLLOW IN THE HILLS I LOOKED BACK
3486-166424-0007 EVEN THE RUINS HAD LOST THEIR SINISTER SHAPE WERE TIME WORN CRUMBLING PILES NOTHING MORE
3486-166424-0008 A RIFLE SHOT RANG OUT ABOVE US ANOTHER AND ANOTHER FROM THE PORTAL SCAMPERED CHIU MING HIS ROBE TUCKED UP ABOUT HIS KNEES THEY COME HE GASPED THEY COME
3486-166424-0009 DOWN IT WAS POURING AN AVALANCHE OF MEN I CAUGHT THE GLINT OF HELMETS AND CORSELETS THOSE IN THE VAN WERE MOUNTED GALLOPING TWO ABREAST UPON SURE FOOTED MOUNTAIN PONIES THEIR SHORT SWORDS LIFTED HIGH FLICKERED

3486-166424-0014 AS WE SPED AFTER HIM I LOOKED BACK THE HORSEMEN HAD RECOVERED WERE NOW A SCANT HALF MILE FROM WHERE THE ROAD SWEPT PAST THE FORTRESS I SAW THAT WITH THEIR SWORDS THE HORSEMEN BORE GREAT BOWS A LITTLE CLOUD OF ARROWS SPARKLED FROM THEM
3486-166424-0015 FELL FAR SHORT DON'T LOOK BACK GRUNTED VENTNOR STRETCH YOURSELF WALTER THERE'S A SURPRISE COMING HOPE TO GOD I JUDGED THE TIME RIGHT WE TURNED OFF THE RUINED WAY

3486-166424-0017 SCATTERED PRONE AMONG THESE WERE MEN AND HORSES OTHERS STAGGERED SCREAMING ON THE FARTHER SIDE OF THIS STONY DIKE OUR PURSUERS WERE HELD LIKE RUSHING WATERS BEHIND A SUDDEN FALLEN TREE TIMED TO A SECOND CRIED VENTNOR HOLD EM FOR A WHILE
3486-166424-0018 AND HOLDING RUTH BY THE HAND RACE BACK TOWARD US EVEN AS HE TURNED THE VINE SCREENED ENTRANCE THROUGH WHICH WE HAD COME THROUGH WHICH WE HAD THOUGHT LAY SAFETY STREAMED OTHER ARMORED MEN WE WERE OUTFLANKED TO THE FISSURE SHOUTED VENTNOR
3486-166424-0019 DRAKE HEARD FOR HE CHANGED HIS COURSE TO THE CREVICE AT WHOSE MOUTH RUTH HAD SAID THE LITTLE THINGS HAD LAIN AFTER HIM STREAKED CHIU MING URGING ON THE PONY SHOUTING OUT OF THE TUNNEL DOWN OVER THE LIP OF THE BOWL LEAPED THE SOLDIERS
3486-166424-0020 WE DROPPED UPON OUR KNEES SENT SHOT AFTER SHOT INTO THEM THEY FELL BACK HESITATED WE SPRANG UP SPED ON ALL TOO SHORT WAS THE CHECK BUT ONCE MORE WE HELD THEM AND AGAIN NOW RUTH AND DICK WERE A SCANT FIFTY YARDS FROM THE CREVICE I SAW HIM STOP
3486-166424-0021 PUSH HER FROM HIM TOWARD IT SHE SHOOK HER HEAD NOW CHIU MING WAS WITH THEM RUTH SPRANG TO THE PONY LIFTED FROM ITS BACK A RIFLE THEN INTO THE MASS OF THEIR PURSUERS DRAKE AND SHE POURED A FUSILLADE THEY HUDDLED WAVERED BROKE FOR COVER

3486-166424-0024 NATURE'S SUMMONING OF EVERY RESERVE TO MEET THAT PERIL MY EYES TOOK THEM IN WITH PHOTOGRAPHIC NICETY THE LINKED MAIL LACQUERED BLUE AND SCARLET OF THE HORSEMEN BROWN PADDED ARMOR OF THE FOOTMEN
3486-166424-0025 THEIR BOWS AND JAVELINS AND SHORT BRONZE SWORDS THEIR PIKES AND SHIELDS AND UNDER THEIR ROUND HELMETS THEIR CRUEL BEARDED FACES WHITE AS OUR OWN WHERE THE BLACK BEARDS DID NOT COVER THEM THEIR FIERCE AND MOCKING EYES
3486-166424-0026 IN THIS WORLD OF OURS TWENTY CENTURIES BEYOND THEIR TIME SWIFTLY ACCURATELY EVEN AS I SCANNED THEM WE HAD BEEN DRILLING INTO THEM THEY ADVANCED DELIBERATELY HEEDLESS OF THEIR FALLEN THEIR ARROWS HAD CEASED TO FLY
3486-166424-0027 I WONDERED WHY FOR NOW WE WERE WELL WITHIN THEIR RANGE
3486-166424-0028 WE'VE SAVED RUTH ANYWAY HE SAID DRAKE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO HOLD THAT HOLE IN THE WALL HE'S GOT LOTS OF AMMUNITION ON THE PONY BUT THEY'VE GOT US ANOTHER WILD SHOUTING DOWN SWEPT THE PACK
3486-166424-0029 WE LEAPED TO OUR FEET SENT OUR LAST BULLETS INTO THEM STOOD READY RIFLES CLUBBED TO MEET THE RUSH I HEARD RUTH SCREAM WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH THE ARMORED MEN WHY HAD THEY HALTED
3486-166424-0030 WHAT WAS IT AT WHICH THEY WERE GLARING OVER OUR HEADS AND WHY HAD THE RIFLE FIRE OF RUTH AND DRAKE CEASED SO ABRUPTLY SIMULTANEOUSLY WE TURNED WITHIN THE BLACK BACKGROUND OF THE FISSURE STOOD A SHAPE AN APPARITION
3486-166424-0031 A WOMAN BEAUTIFUL AWESOME INCREDIBLE SHE WAS TALL STANDING THERE SWATHED FROM CHIN TO FEET IN CLINGING VEILS OF PALE AMBER SHE SEEMED TALLER EVEN THAN TALL DRAKE
3486-166424-0032 YET IT WAS NOT HER HEIGHT THAT SENT THROUGH ME THE THRILL OF AWE OF HALF INCREDULOUS TERROR WHICH RELAXING MY GRIP LET MY SMOKING RIFLE DROP TO EARTH NOR WAS IT THAT ABOUT HER PROUD HEAD A CLOUD OF SHINING TRESSES SWIRLED AND PENNONED
3486-166424-0033 LIKE A MISTY BANNER OF WOVEN COPPER FLAMES NO NOR THAT THROUGH HER VEILS HER BODY GLEAMED FAINT RADIANCE IT WAS HER EYES HER GREAT WIDE EYES WHOSE CLEAR DEPTHS WERE LIKE POOLS OF LIVING STAR FIRES
3486-166424-0034 THEY SHONE FROM HER WHITE FACE NOT PHOSPHORESCENT NOT MERELY LUCENT AND LIGHT REFLECTING BUT AS THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES WERE SOURCES OF THE COLD WHITE FLAMES OF FAR STARS AND AS CALM AS THOSE STARS THEMSELVES
3486-166424-0035 AND IN THAT FACE ALTHOUGH AS YET I COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING BUT THE EYES I SENSED SOMETHING UNEARTHLY GOD WHISPERED VENTNOR WHAT IS SHE
3486-166424-0036 THE WOMAN STEPPED FROM THE CREVICE NOT FIFTY FEET FROM HER WERE RUTH AND DRAKE AND CHIU MING THEIR RIGID ATTITUDES REVEALING THE SAME SHOCK OF AWE THAT HAD MOMENTARILY PARALYZED ME SHE LOOKED AT THEM BECKONED THEM
3486-166424-0037 I SAW THE TWO WALK TOWARD HER CHIU MING HANG BACK THE GREAT EYES FELL UPON VENTNOR AND MYSELF SHE RAISED A HAND MOTIONED US TO APPROACH I TURNED THERE STOOD THE HOST THAT HAD POURED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN ROAD
3486-166424-0038 HORSEMEN SPEARSMEN PIKEMEN A FULL THOUSAND OF THEM AT MY RIGHT WERE THE SCATTERED COMPANY THAT HAD COME FROM THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE THREESCORE OR MORE THERE SEEMED A SPELL UPON THEM
3486-166424-0039 THEY STOOD IN SILENCE LIKE AUTOMATONS ONLY THEIR FIERCELY STARING EYES SHOWING THAT THEY WERE ALIVE QUICK BREATHED VENTNOR WE RAN TOWARD HER WHO HAD CHECKED DEATH EVEN WHILE ITS JAWS WERE CLOSING UPON US
3486-166424-0040 BEFORE WE HAD GONE HALF WAY AS THOUGH OUR FLIGHT HAD BROKEN WHATEVER BONDS HAD BOUND THEM A CLAMOR AROSE FROM THE HOST A WILD SHOUTING A CLANGING OF SWORDS ON SHIELDS I SHOT A GLANCE BEHIND THEY WERE IN MOTION ADVANCING SLOWLY
3486-166424-0041 HESITATINGLY AS YET BUT I KNEW THAT SOON THAT HESITATION WOULD PASS THAT THEY WOULD SWEEP DOWN UPON US ENGULF US TO THE CREVICE I SHOUTED TO DRAKE HE PAID NO HEED TO ME NOR DID RUTH
3486-166424-0042 THEIR GAZE FASTENED UPON THE SWATHED WOMAN VENTNOR'S HAND SHOT OUT GRIPPED MY SHOULDER HALTED ME SHE HAD THROWN UP HER HEAD
3486-166424-0043 FROM THE LIFTED THROAT CAME A LOW A VIBRANT CRY HARMONIOUS WEIRDLY DISQUIETING GOLDEN AND SWEET AND LADEN WITH THE EERY MINOR WAILINGS OF THE BLUE VALLEY'S NIGHT THE DRAGONED CHAMBER
3486-166424-0044 BEFORE THE CRY HAD CEASED THERE POURED WITH INCREDIBLE SWIFTNESS OUT OF THE CREVICE SCORE UPON SCORE OF THE METAL THINGS THE FISSURES VOMITED THEM
3486-166424-0045 GLOBES AND CUBES AND PYRAMIDS NOT SMALL LIKE THOSE OF THE RUINS BUT SHAPES ALL OF FOUR FEET HIGH DULLY LUSTROUS AND DEEP WITHIN THAT LUSTER THE MYRIADS OF TINY POINTS OF LIGHT LIKE UNWINKING STARING EYES
3486-166424-0046 THEY SWIRLED EDDIED AND FORMED A BARRICADE BETWEEN US AND THE ARMORED MEN DOWN UPON THEM POURED A SHOWER OF ARROWS FROM THE SOLDIERS I HEARD THE SHOUTS OF THEIR CAPTAINS THEY RUSHED THEY HAD COURAGE THOSE MEN YES AGAIN CAME THE WOMAN'S CRY
3486-166424-0047 UP FROM THEM THRUST A THICK RECTANGULAR COLUMN
3486-166424-0048 EIGHT FEET IN WIDTH AND TWENTY FEET HIGH IT SHAPED ITSELF OUT FROM ITS LEFT SIDE FROM RIGHT SIDE SPRANG ARMS FEARFUL ARMS THAT GREW AND GREW AS GLOBE AND CUBE AND ANGLE RACED UP THE COLUMN'S SIDE AND CLICKED INTO PLACE EACH UPON EACH AFTER THE OTHER
3486-166424-0049 WITH MAGICAL QUICKNESS THE ARMS LENGTHENED BEFORE US STOOD A MONSTROUS SHAPE A GEOMETRIC PRODIGY
3486-166424-0050 A SHINING ANGLED PILLAR THAT THOUGH RIGID IMMOBILE SEEMED TO CROUCH BE INSTINCT WITH LIVING FORCE STRIVING TO BE UNLEASHED TWO GREAT GLOBES SURMOUNTED IT
3486-166424-0051 FLEXING THEMSELVES IN GROTESQUE IMITATION OF A BOXER
3486-166424-0052 AGAIN IN GIGANTIC AWFUL PARODY OF THE SPIKED GLOVES OF THOSE ANCIENT GLADIATORS WHO FOUGHT FOR IMPERIAL NERO
3486-166424-0053 PREENING TESTING ITSELF LIKE AN ATHLETE
3486-166424-0054 UNDER THE DARKENING SKY IN THE GREEN OF THE HOLLOW THE ARMORED HOSTS FROZEN BEFORE IT AND THEN IT STRUCK OUT FLASHED TWO OF THE ARMS WITH A GLANCING MOTION WITH APPALLING FORCE
3486-166424-0055 THEY SLICED INTO THE CLOSE PACKED FORWARD RANKS OF THE ARMORED MEN CUT OUT OF THEM TWO GREAT GAPS SICKENED I SAW FRAGMENTS OF MAN AND HORSE FLY ANOTHER ARM JAVELINED FROM ITS PLACE LIKE A FLYING SNAKE CLICKED AT THE END OF ANOTHER
3486-166424-0056 BECAME A HUNDRED FOOT CHAIN WHICH SWIRLED LIKE A FLAIL THROUGH THE HUDDLING MASS DOWN UPON A KNOT OF THE SOLDIERS WITH A STRAIGHT FORWARD BLOW DROVE A THIRD ARM DRIVING THROUGH THEM LIKE A GIANT PUNCH
3486-166424-0057 ALL THAT HOST WHICH HAD DRIVEN US FROM THE RUINS THREW DOWN SWORD SPEAR AND PIKE FLED SHRIEKING THE HORSEMEN SPURRED THEIR MOUNTS RIDING HEEDLESS OVER THE FOOTMEN WHO FLED WITH THEM THE SMITING THING SEEMED TO WATCH THEM GO
3486-166424-0058 WITH AMUSEMENT BEFORE THEY COULD COVER A HUNDRED YARDS IT HAD DISINTEGRATED I HEARD THE LITTLE WAILING SOUNDS THEN BEHIND THE FLEEING MEN CLOSE BEHIND THEM ROSE THE ANGLED PILLAR INTO PLACE SPRANG THE FLEXING ARMS AND AGAIN IT TOOK ITS TOLL OF THEM
3486-166424-0059 THEY SCATTERED RUNNING SINGLY BY TWOS IN LITTLE GROUPS FOR THE SIDES OF THE VALLEY THEY WERE LIKE RATS SCAMPERING IN PANIC OVER THE BOTTOM OF A GREAT GREEN BOWL AND LIKE A MONSTROUS CAT THE SHAPE PLAYED WITH THEM YES PLAYED
3486-166424-0060 IT MELTED ONCE MORE TOOK NEW FORM WHERE HAD BEEN PILLAR AND FLAILING ARMS WAS NOW A TRIPOD THIRTY FEET HIGH ITS LEGS ALTERNATE GLOBE AND CUBE AND UPON ITS APEX A WIDE AND SPINNING RING OF SPARKLING SPHERES
3486-166424-0061 OUT FROM THE MIDDLE OF THIS RING STRETCHED A TENTACLE WRITHING UNDULATING LIKE A SERPENT OF STEEL FOUR SCORE YARDS AT LEAST IN LENGTH
3486-166424-0062 WITH THE THREE LONG PRONGS OF THIS TRIDENT THE THING STRUCK SWIFTLY
3486-166424-0063 IT WAS I THINK THAT LAST TOUCH OF SHEER HORROR THE PLAYFULNESS OF THE SMITING THING THAT SENT MY DRY TONGUE TO THE ROOF OF MY TERROR PARCHED MOUTH AND HELD OPEN WITH MONSTROUS FASCINATION EYES THAT STRUGGLED TO CLOSE
3486-166424-0064 EVER THE ARMORED MEN FLED FROM IT AND EVER WAS IT SWIFTER THAN THEY TEETERING AT THEIR HEELS ON ITS TRIPOD LEGS FROM HALF ITS LENGTH THE DARTING SNAKE STREAMED RED RAIN I HEARD A SIGH FROM RUTH
3486-166424-0065 WRESTED MY GAZE FROM THE HOLLOW TURNED SHE LAY FAINTING IN DRAKE'S ARMS BESIDE THE TWO THE SWATHED WOMAN STOOD LOOKING OUT UPON THAT SLAUGHTER CALM AND STILL SHROUDED WITH AN UNEARTHLY TRANQUILLITY
3486-166424-0066 VIEWING IT IT CAME TO ME WITH EYES IMPERSONAL COLD INDIFFERENT AS THE UNTROUBLED STARS WHICH LOOK DOWN UPON HURRICANE AND EARTHQUAKE IN THIS WORLD OF OURS THERE WAS A RUSHING OF MANY FEET AT OUR LEFT A WAIL FROM CHIU MING
3486-166424-0067 WERE THEY MADDENED BY FEAR DRIVEN BY DESPAIR DETERMINED TO SLAY BEFORE THEY THEMSELVES WERE SLAIN I DO NOT KNOW BUT THOSE WHO STILL LIVED OF THE MEN FROM THE TUNNEL MOUTH WERE CHARGING US THEY CLUSTERED CLOSE THEIR SHIELDS HELD BEFORE THEM
3486-166424-0068 THEY HAD NO BOWS THESE MEN THEY MOVED SWIFTLY DOWN UPON US IN SILENCE SWORDS AND PIKES GLEAMING THE SMITING THING ROCKED TOWARD US THE METAL TENTACLE STRAINING OUT LIKE A RIGID RACING SERPENT FLYING TO CUT BETWEEN ITS WEIRD MISTRESS AND THOSE WHO MENACED HER
3486-166424-0069 I HEARD CHIU MING SCREAM SAW HIM THROW UP HIS HANDS COVER HIS EYES RUN STRAIGHT UPON THE PIKES CHIU MING I SHOUTED CHIU MING THIS WAY I RAN TOWARD HIM
3486-166424-0070 I SAW A SPEAR THROWN IT STRUCK THE CHINAMAN SQUARELY IN THE BREAST HE TOTTERED FELL UPON HIS KNEES EVEN AS HE DROPPED THE GIANT FLAIL SWEPT DOWN UPON THE SOLDIERS IT SWEPT THROUGH THEM LIKE A SCYTHE THROUGH RIPE GRAIN
3486-166424-0071 IT THREW THEM BROKEN AND TORN FAR TOWARD THE VALLEY'S SLOPING SIDES IT LEFT ONLY FRAGMENTS THAT BORE NO SEMBLANCE TO MEN VENTNOR WAS AT CHIU MING'S HEAD I DROPPED BESIDE HIM THERE WAS A CRIMSON FROTH UPON HIS LIPS
3486-166424-0072 I THOUGHT THAT SHIN JE WAS ABOUT TO SLAY US HE WHISPERED FEAR BLINDED ME HIS HEAD DROPPED HIS BODY QUIVERED LAY STILL WE AROSE LOOKED ABOUT US DAZEDLY
3486-166424-0073 AT THE SIDE OF THE CREVICE STOOD THE WOMAN HER GAZE RESTING UPON DRAKE HIS ARMS ABOUT RUTH HER HEAD HIDDEN ON HIS BREAST THE VALLEY WAS EMPTY SAVE FOR THE HUDDLED HEAPS THAT DOTTED IT
3486-166424-0074 HIGH UP ON THE MOUNTAIN PATH A SCORE OF FIGURES CREPT ALL THAT WERE LEFT OF THOSE WHO BUT A LITTLE BEFORE HAD STREAMED DOWN TO TAKE US CAPTIVE OR TO SLAY
3486-166424-0075 HIGH UP IN THE DARKENING HEAVENS THE LAMMERGEIERS THE WINGED SCAVENGERS OF THE HIMALAYAS WERE GATHERING THE WOMAN LIFTED HER HAND BECKONED US ONCE MORE SLOWLY WE WALKED TOWARD HER STOOD BEFORE HER
3486-166446-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN THE DRUMS OF DESTINY SLOWLY WE DESCENDED THAT MOUNT OF DESOLATION LINGERINGLY AS THOUGH THE BROODING EYES OF NORHALA WERE NOT YET SATED WITH DESTRUCTION
3486-166446-0001 OF HUMAN LIFE OF GREEN LIFE OF LIFE OF ANY KIND THERE WAS NONE
3486-166446-0002 PALACE TEMPLE AND HOME NORHALA HAD STAMPED FLAT SHE HAD CRUSHED THEM WITHIN THE ROCK EVEN AS SHE HAD PROMISED THE TREMENDOUS TRAGEDY HAD ABSORBED MY EVERY FACULTY
3486-166446-0003 NOW IN THE PAINFUL SURGES OF AWAKENING REALIZATION OF FULL HUMAN UNDERSTANDING OF THAT INHUMAN ANNIHILATION I TURNED TO THEM FOR STRENGTH FAINTLY I WONDERED AGAIN AT RUTH'S SCANTINESS OF GARB HER MORE THAN HALF NUDITY
3486-166446-0004 DWELT CURIOUSLY UPON THE RED BRAND ACROSS VENTNOR'S FOREHEAD
3486-166446-0005 BUT IN THE EYES OF RUTH WAS NONE OF THIS STERNLY COLDLY TRIUMPHANT INDIFFERENT TO ITS PITEOUSNESS AS NORHALA HERSELF SHE SCANNED THE WASTE THAT LESS THAN AN HOUR SINCE HAD BEEN A PLACE OF LIVING BEAUTY I FELT A SHOCK OF REPULSION AFTER ALL
3486-166446-0006 YET MOTHER AND BLOSSOMING MAID YOUTH AND OLDSTER ALL THE PAGEANT OF HUMANITY WITHIN THE GREAT WALLS WERE NOW BUT LINES WITHIN THE STONE ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT LIGHTS IT CAME TO ME THERE HAD BEEN
3486-166446-0007 FROM NORHALA OF COURSE I LOOKED FOR NO PERCEPTION OF ANY OF THIS BUT FROM RUTH MY REACTION GREW
3486-166446-0008 THERE WAS DRIED BLOOD ON THE EDGES A DOUBLE RING OF SWOLLEN WHITE FLESH RIMMING THE CINCTURE IT WAS THE MARK OF TORTURE MARTIN I CRIED THAT RING WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU THEY WAKED ME WITH THAT HE ANSWERED QUIETLY
3486-166446-0009 I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL ALTHOUGH THEIR INTENTIONS WERE NOT EXACTLY THERAPEUTIC THEY TORTURED HIM RUTH'S VOICE WAS TENSE BITTER SHE SPOKE IN PERSIAN FOR NORHALA'S BENEFIT I THOUGHT THEN NOT GUESSING A DEEPER REASON
3486-166446-0010 THEY TORTURED HIM THEY GAVE HIM AGONY UNTIL HE RETURNED AND THEY PROMISED HIM OTHER AGONIES THAT WOULD MAKE HIM PRAY LONG FOR DEATH AND ME ME SHE RAISED LITTLE CLENCHED HANDS
3486-166446-0011 ME THEY STRIPPED LIKE A SLAVE THEY LED ME THROUGH THE CITY AND THE PEOPLE MOCKED ME
3486-166446-0012 BEFORE MY EYES THEY TORTURED MY BROTHER NORHALA THEY WERE EVIL ALL EVIL NORHALA YOU DID WELL TO SLAY THEM SHE CAUGHT THE WOMAN'S HANDS PRESSED CLOSE TO HER
3486-166446-0013 NORHALA GAZED AT HER FROM GREAT GRAY EYES IN WHICH THE WRATH WAS DYING INTO WHICH THE OLD TRANQUILLITY THE OLD SERENITY WAS FLOWING AND WHEN SHE SPOKE THE GOLDEN VOICE HELD MORE THAN RETURNING ECHOES OF THE FAR AWAY FAINT CHIMINGS IT IS DONE SHE SAID
3486-166446-0014 AND IT WAS WELL DONE SISTER NOW YOU AND I SHALL DWELL TOGETHER IN PEACE SISTER OR IF THERE BE THOSE IN THE WORLD FROM WHICH YOU CAME THAT YOU WOULD HAVE SLAIN
3486-166446-0015 THEN YOU AND I SHALL GO FORTH WITH OUR COMPANIES AND STAMP THEM OUT EVEN AS I DID THESE MY HEART STOPPED BEATING FOR FROM THE DEPTHS OF RUTH'S EYES SHINING SHADOWS WERE RISING WRAITHS ANSWERING NORHALA'S CALLING
3486-166446-0016 AND AS THEY ROSE STEADILY THEY DREW LIFE FROM THE CLEAR RADIANCE SUMMONING DREW CLOSER TO THE SEMBLANCE OF THAT TRANQUIL SPIRIT WHICH HER VENGEANCE HAD BANISHED
3486-166446-0017 AND AT LAST IT WAS TWIN SISTER OF NORHALA WHO LOOKED UPON HER FROM THE FACE OF RUTH THE WHITE ARMS OF THE WOMAN ENCIRCLED HER THE GLORIOUS HEAD BENT OVER HER FLAMING TRESSES MINGLED WITH TENDER BROWN CURLS
3486-166446-0018 SISTER SHE WHISPERED LITTLE SISTER THESE MEN YOU SHALL HAVE AS LONG AS IT PLEASES YOU TO DO WITH AS YOU WILL OR IF IT IS YOUR WISH THEY SHALL GO BACK TO THEIR WORLD AND I WILL GUARD THEM TO ITS GATES
3486-166446-0019 BUT YOU AND I LITTLE SISTER WILL DWELL TOGETHER IN THE VASTNESSES IN THE PEACE SHALL IT NOT BE SO WITH NO FALTERING WITH NO GLANCE TOWARD US THREE
3486-166446-0020 LOVER BROTHER OLD FRIEND RUTH CREPT CLOSER TO HER RESTED HER HEAD UPON THE VIRGINAL ROYAL BREASTS IT SHALL BE SO SHE MURMURED SISTER IT SHALL BE SO NORHALA I AM TIRED NORHALA I HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF MEN
3486-166446-0021 AN ECSTASY OF TENDERNESS A FLAME OF UNEARTHLY RAPTURE TREMBLED OVER THE WOMAN'S WONDROUS FACE HUNGRILY DEFIANTLY SHE PRESSED THE GIRL TO HER THE STARS IN THE LUCID HEAVENS OF HER EYES WERE SOFT AND GENTLE AND CARESSING
3486-166446-0022 RUTH CRIED DRAKE AND SPRANG TOWARD THEM SHE PAID NO HEED AND EVEN AS HE LEAPED HE WAS CAUGHT WHIRLED BACK AGAINST US WAIT SAID VENTNOR
3486-166446-0023 THERE WAS A CURIOUS UNDERSTANDING IN HIS VOICE A CURIOUS SYMPATHY TOO IN THE PATIENT UNTROUBLED GAZE THAT DWELT UPON HIS SISTER AND THIS WEIRDLY EXQUISITE WOMAN WHO HELD HER WAIT EXCLAIMED DRAKE WAIT HELL THE DAMNED WITCH IS STEALING HER AWAY FROM US
3486-166446-0024 AGAIN HE THREW HIMSELF FORWARD RECOILED AS THOUGH SWEPT BACK BY AN INVISIBLE ARM FELL AGAINST US AND WAS CLASPED AND HELD BY VENTNOR AND AS HE STRUGGLED THE THING WE RODE HALTED
3486-166446-0025 LIKE METAL WAVES BACK INTO IT RUSHED THE ENIGMATIC BILLOWS THAT HAD WASHED OVER THE FRAGMENTS OF THE CITY WE WERE LIFTED BETWEEN US AND THE WOMAN AND GIRL A CLEFT APPEARED IT WIDENED INTO A RIFT
3486-166446-0026 IT WAS AS THOUGH NORHALA HAD DECREED IT AS A SYMBOL OF THIS HER SECOND VICTORY OR HAD SET IT BETWEEN US AS A BARRIER WIDER GREW THE RIFT
3486-166446-0027 SAVE FOR THE BRIDGE OF OUR VOICES IT SEPARATED US FROM RUTH AS THOUGH SHE STOOD UPON ANOTHER WORLD HIGHER WE ROSE THE THREE OF US NOW UPON THE FLAT TOP OF A TOWER UPON WHOSE COUNTERPART FIFTY FEET AWAY
3486-166446-0028 QUIETLY IT GLIDED TO THE CHASM IT HAD BLASTED IN THE CLIFF WALL THE SHADOW OF THOSE WALLS FELL UPON US AS ONE WE LOOKED BACK AS ONE WE SEARCHED OUT THE PATCH OF BLUE WITH THE BLACK BLOT AT ITS BREAST WE FOUND IT THEN THE PRECIPICES HID IT
3486-166446-0029 SILENTLY WE STREAMED THROUGH THE CHASM THROUGH THE CANYON AND THE TUNNEL SPEAKING NO WORD DRAKE'S EYES FIXED WITH BITTER HATRED UPON NORHALA VENTNOR BROODING UPON HER ALWAYS WITH THAT ENIGMATIC SYMPATHY WE PASSED BETWEEN THE WALLS OF THE FURTHER CLEFT
3486-166446-0030 STOOD FOR AN INSTANT AT THE BRINK OF THE GREEN FOREST THERE CAME TO US AS THOUGH FROM IMMEASURABLE DISTANCES A FAINT SUSTAINED THRUMMING LIKE THE BEATING OF COUNTLESS MUFFLED DRUMS THE THING THAT CARRIED US TREMBLED THE SOUND DIED AWAY
3486-166446-0031 THE THING QUIETED IT BEGAN ITS STEADY EFFORTLESS STRIDING THROUGH THE CROWDING TREES BUT NOW WITH NONE OF THAT SPEED WITH WHICH IT HAD COME SPURRED FORWARD BY NORHALA'S AWAKENED HATE VENTNOR STIRRED
3486-166446-0032 PURGED NOT ONLY BY SUFFERING BUT BY IT CAME TO ME SOME STRANGE KNOWLEDGE NO USE DRAKE HE SAID DREAMILY
3486-166446-0033 BUT THIS I DO KNOW ONLY ONE WAY OR ANOTHER CAN THE BALANCE FALL AND IF IT BE ONE WAY THEN YOU AND WE SHALL HAVE RUTH BACK AND IF IT FALLS THE OTHER WAY THEN THERE WILL BE LITTLE NEED FOR US TO CARE FOR MAN WILL BE DONE MARTIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN
3486-166446-0034 IT IS THE CRISIS HE ANSWERED WE CAN DO NOTHING GOODWIN NOTHING WHATEVER IS TO BE STEPS FORTH NOW FROM THE WOMB OF DESTINY AGAIN THERE CAME THAT DISTANT ROLLING LOUDER NOW AGAIN THE THING TREMBLED
3486-166446-0035 IS IT TAPS FOR THEM THE DRUMMING DIED AS I LISTENED FEARFULLY ABOUT US WAS ONLY THE SWISHING THE SIGHING OF THE FALLING TREES BENEATH THE TREAD OF THE THING MOTIONLESS STOOD NORHALA
3486-166446-0036 AND AS MOTIONLESS RUTH MARTIN I CRIED ONCE MORE A DREADFUL DOUBT UPON ME MARTIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHENCE DID THEY COME HIS VOICE WAS CLEAR AND CALM THE EYES BENEATH
3486-166446-0037 THESE CREATURES THAT WHEN MANY STILL ARE ONE THAT WHEN ONE STILL ARE MANY WHENCE DID THEY COME WHAT ARE THEY HE LOOKED DOWN UPON THE CUBES THAT HELD US THEIR HOSTS OF TINY EYES SHONE UP AT HIM ENIGMATICALLY
3486-166446-0038 AS THOUGH THEY HEARD AND UNDERSTOOD I DO NOT FORGET HE SAID AT LEAST NOT ALL DO I FORGET OF WHAT I SAW DURING THAT TIME WHEN I SEEMED AN ATOM OUTSIDE SPACE
3486-166446-0039 AS I TOLD YOU OR THINK I TOLD YOU SPEAKING WITH UNTHINKABLE EFFORT THROUGH LIPS THAT SEEMED ETERNITIES AWAY FROM ME THE ATOM WHO STROVE TO OPEN THEM
3486-166446-0040 REVELATIONS I KNOW NOT WHAT TO CALL THEM AND THOUGH EACH SEEMED EQUALLY REAL OF TWO OF THEM ONLY ONE I THINK CAN BE TRUE AND OF THE THIRD THAT MAY SOME TIME BE TRUE BUT SURELY IS NOT YET THROUGH THE AIR CAME A LOUDER DRUM ROLL
3486-166446-0041 IN IT SOMETHING OMINOUS SOMETHING SINISTER IT SWELLED TO A CRESCENDO ABRUPTLY CEASED AND NOW I SAW NORHALA RAISE HER HEAD LISTEN I SAW A WORLD A VAST WORLD GOODWIN MARCHING STATELY THROUGH SPACE
3486-166446-0042 IT WAS NO GLOBE IT WAS A WORLD OF MANY FACETS OF SMOOTH AND POLISHED PLANES
3486-166446-0043 A GEOMETRIC THOUGHT OF THE GREAT CAUSE OF GOD IF YOU WILL MADE MATERIAL IT WAS AIRLESS WATERLESS SUNLESS
3526-175658-0000 PERMISSION TO ACCEPT SUCH ADDITIONAL EMPLOYMENT SHOULD IT OFFER HAVING FORMED AN ARTICLE OF THE TERMS ON WHICH HE HAD ENGAGED ME IT WAS THEREFORE ARRANGED IN THE COURSE OF NEXT DAY
3526-175658-0001 WHEN EVENING CAME I PREPARED TO STEP OVER IN ORDER TO SEEK A CONFERENCE WITH MADEMOISELLE HERSELF ON THE SUBJECT I HAD NOT HAD TIME TO PAY THE VISIT BEFORE HAVING BEEN ALL DAY CLOSELY OCCUPIED IN CLASS
3526-175658-0002 I REMEMBER VERY WELL THAT BEFORE QUITTING MY CHAMBER I HELD A BRIEF DEBATE WITH MYSELF AS TO WHETHER I SHOULD CHANGE MY ORDINARY ATTIRE FOR SOMETHING SMARTER AT LAST I CONCLUDED IT WOULD BE A WASTE OF LABOUR DOUBTLESS THOUGHT I
3526-175658-0003 SHE IS SOME STIFF OLD MAID FOR THOUGH THE DAUGHTER OF MADAME REUTER SHE MAY WELL NUMBER UPWARDS OF FORTY WINTERS BESIDES IF IT WERE OTHERWISE IF SHE BE BOTH YOUNG AND PRETTY I AM NOT HANDSOME
3526-175658-0004 AND NO DRESSING CAN MAKE ME SO THEREFORE I'LL GO AS I AM AND OFF I STARTED CURSORILY GLANCING SIDEWAYS AS I PASSED THE TOILET TABLE SURMOUNTED BY A LOOKING GLASS A THIN IRREGULAR FACE I SAW
3526-175658-0005 WITH SUNK DARK EYES UNDER A LARGE SQUARE FOREHEAD COMPLEXION DESTITUTE OF BLOOM OR ATTRACTION SOMETHING YOUNG BUT NOT YOUTHFUL NO OBJECT TO WIN A LADY'S LOVE NO BUTT FOR THE SHAFTS OF CUPID
3526-175658-0006 IN A MOMENT I HAD PULLED THE BELL IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND WITHIN APPEARED A PASSAGE PAVED ALTERNATELY WITH BLACK AND WHITE MARBLE THE WALLS WERE PAINTED IN IMITATION OF MARBLE ALSO AND AT THE FAR END OPENED A GLASS DOOR
3526-175658-0007 THROUGH WHICH I SAW SHRUBS AND A GRASS PLAT LOOKING PLEASANT IN THE SUNSHINE OF THE MILD SPRING EVENING FOR IT WAS NOW THE MIDDLE OF APRIL THIS THEN WAS MY FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE GARDEN BUT I HAD NOT TIME TO LOOK LONG
3526-175658-0008 THE PORTRESS AFTER HAVING ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE MY QUESTION AS TO WHETHER HER MISTRESS WAS AT HOME OPENED THE FOLDING DOORS OF A ROOM TO THE LEFT AND HAVING USHERED ME IN CLOSED THEM BEHIND ME I FOUND MYSELF IN A SALON
3526-175658-0009 WITH A VERY WELL PAINTED HIGHLY VARNISHED FLOOR CHAIRS AND SOFAS COVERED WITH WHITE DRAPERIES A GREEN PORCELAIN STOVE WALLS HUNG WITH PICTURES IN GILT FRAMES A GILT PENDULE AND OTHER ORNAMENTS ON THE MANTELPIECE
3526-175658-0010 A LARGE LUSTRE PENDENT FROM THE CENTRE OF THE CEILING MIRRORS CONSOLES MUSLIN CURTAINS AND A HANDSOME CENTRE TABLE COMPLETED THE INVENTORY OF FURNITURE ALL LOOKED EXTREMELY CLEAN AND GLITTERING
3526-175658-0011 BUT THE GENERAL EFFECT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT CHILLING HAD NOT A SECOND LARGE PAIR OF FOLDING DOORS STANDING WIDE OPEN AND DISCLOSING ANOTHER AND SMALLER SALON MORE SNUGLY FURNISHED OFFERED SOME RELIEF TO THE EYE
3526-175658-0012 THIS ROOM WAS CARPETED AND THEREIN WAS A PIANO A COUCH A CHIFFONNIERE
3526-175658-0013 WHICH BEING UNDRAWN AFFORDED ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF THE GARDEN THROUGH THE LARGE CLEAR PANES ROUND WHICH SOME LEAVES OF IVY SOME TENDRILS OF VINE WERE TRAINED
3526-175658-0014 FOR I AM NOT EASILY EMBARRASSED I COMMENCED THE CONVERSATION BY REMARKING ON THE PLEASANT ASPECT OF HER LITTLE CABINET
3526-175658-0015 YES SHE SAID SHE OFTEN THOUGHT SO AND ADDED
3526-175658-0016 BUT YOU SEE I COULD NOT TAKE MY GARDEN WITH ME AND I SHOULD SCARCELY FIND ONE SO LARGE AND PLEASANT ANYWHERE ELSE IN TOWN I APPROVED HER JUDGMENT BUT YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT YET SAID SHE RISING
3526-175658-0017 COME TO THE WINDOW AND TAKE A BETTER VIEW I FOLLOWED HER SHE OPENED THE SASH AND LEANING OUT I SAW IN FULL THE ENCLOSED DEMESNE WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN TO ME AN UNKNOWN REGION IT WAS A LONG
3526-175658-0018 NOT VERY BROAD STRIP OF CULTURED GROUND WITH AN ALLEY BORDERED BY ENORMOUS OLD FRUIT TREES DOWN THE MIDDLE THERE WAS A SORT OF LAWN A PARTERRE OF ROSE TREES SOME FLOWER BORDERS AND ON THE FAR SIDE
3526-175658-0019 IT LOOKED PLEASANT TO ME VERY PLEASANT SO LONG A TIME HAD ELAPSED SINCE I HAD SEEN A GARDEN OF ANY SORT
3526-175658-0020 WHEN I HAD TAKEN A VIEW OF HER WELL TRIMMED BEDS AND BUDDING SHRUBBERIES I ALLOWED MY GLANCE TO COME BACK TO HERSELF NOR DID I HASTILY WITHDRAW IT
3526-175658-0021 WHO MIGHT INDEED BE OLDER THAN I BUT WAS STILL YOUNG SHE COULD NOT I THOUGHT BE MORE THAN SIX OR SEVEN AND TWENTY SHE WAS AS FAIR AS A FAIR ENGLISHWOMAN SHE HAD NO CAP HER HAIR WAS NUT BROWN AND SHE WORE IT IN CURLS
3526-175658-0022 PRETTY HER FEATURES WERE NOT NOR VERY SOFT NOR VERY REGULAR BUT NEITHER WERE THEY IN ANY DEGREE PLAIN AND I ALREADY SAW CAUSE TO DEEM THEM EXPRESSIVE WHAT WAS THEIR PREDOMINANT CAST
3526-175658-0023 WAS IT SAGACITY SENSE YES I THOUGHT SO BUT I COULD SCARCELY AS YET BE SURE I DISCOVERED HOWEVER
3526-175658-0024 SHE SAID SHE WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF THE WISDOM OF THE STEP SHE WAS ABOUT TO TAKE BECAUSE I WAS SO YOUNG AND PARENTS MIGHT POSSIBLY OBJECT TO A PROFESSOR LIKE ME FOR THEIR DAUGHTERS BUT IT IS OFTEN WELL TO ACT ON ONE'S OWN JUDGMENT SAID SHE
3526-175658-0025 AND TO LEAD PARENTS RATHER THAN BE LED BY THEM THE FITNESS OF A PROFESSOR IS NOT A MATTER OF AGE AND FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD AND FROM WHAT I OBSERVE MYSELF
3526-175658-0026 WHO IS A MARRIED MAN OF NEAR FIFTY I REMARKED THAT I HOPED SHE WOULD FIND ME WORTHY OF HER GOOD OPINION THAT IF I KNEW MYSELF I WAS INCAPABLE OF BETRAYING ANY CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN ME DU RESTE SAID SHE
3526-175658-0027 THE SURVEILLANCE WILL BE STRICTLY ATTENDED TO AND THEN SHE PROCEEDED TO DISCUSS THE SUBJECT OF TERMS SHE WAS VERY CAUTIOUS QUITE ON HER GUARD SHE DID NOT ABSOLUTELY BARGAIN BUT SHE WARILY SOUNDED ME TO FIND OUT WHAT MY EXPECTATIONS MIGHT BE
3526-175658-0028 AND WHEN SHE COULD NOT GET ME TO NAME A SUM SHE REASONED AND REASONED WITH A FLUENT YET QUIET CIRCUMLOCUTION OF SPEECH AND AT LAST NAILED ME DOWN TO FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS PER ANNUM NOT TOO MUCH BUT I AGREED
3526-175658-0029 BEFORE THE NEGOTIATION WAS COMPLETED IT BEGAN TO GROW A LITTLE DUSK I DID NOT HASTEN IT FOR I LIKED WELL ENOUGH TO SIT AND HEAR HER TALK I WAS AMUSED WITH THE SORT OF BUSINESS TALENT SHE DISPLAYED EDWARD COULD NOT HAVE SHOWN HIMSELF MORE PRACTICAL
3526-175658-0030 THOUGH HE MIGHT HAVE EVINCED MORE COARSENESS AND URGENCY AND THEN SHE HAD SO MANY REASONS SO MANY EXPLANATIONS AND AFTER ALL SHE SUCCEEDED IN PROVING HERSELF QUITE DISINTERESTED AND EVEN LIBERAL AT LAST SHE CONCLUDED SHE COULD SAY NO MORE
3526-175658-0031 BECAUSE AS I ACQUIESCED IN ALL THINGS THERE WAS NO FURTHER GROUND FOR THE EXERCISE OF HER PARTS OF SPEECH I WAS OBLIGED TO RISE I WOULD RATHER HAVE SAT A LITTLE LONGER WHAT HAD I TO RETURN TO BUT MY SMALL EMPTY ROOM
3526-175658-0032 ESPECIALLY NOW WHEN THE TWILIGHT SOFTENED HER FEATURES A LITTLE AND IN THE DOUBTFUL DUSK I COULD FANCY HER FOREHEAD AS OPEN AS IT WAS REALLY ELEVATED HER MOUTH TOUCHED WITH TURNS OF SWEETNESS AS WELL AS DEFINED IN LINES OF SENSE
3526-175658-0033 WHEN I ROSE TO GO I HELD OUT MY HAND ON PURPOSE THOUGH I KNEW IT WAS CONTRARY TO THE ETIQUETTE OF FOREIGN HABITS SHE SMILED AND SAID AH
3526-175658-0034 AND WITH THE SORT OF TRANQUILLITY OBVIOUS IN ALL SHE DID A TRANQUILLITY WHICH SOOTHED AND SUITED ME SINGULARLY AT LEAST I THOUGHT SO THAT EVENING BRUSSELS SEEMED A VERY PLEASANT PLACE TO ME WHEN I GOT OUT AGAIN INTO THE STREET
3526-175658-0035 AND IT APPEARED AS IF SOME CHEERFUL EVENTFUL UPWARD TENDING CAREER WERE EVEN THEN OPENING TO ME ON THAT SELFSAME MILD STILL APRIL NIGHT
3526-176651-0000 AND HER DEEP EYES FIXED ON THE SMOKE IN THE VALLEY BELOW HER BREATH WAS STILL COMING FAST BETWEEN HER PARTED LIPS THERE WERE TINY DROPS ALONG THE ROOTS OF HER SHINING HAIR FOR THE CLIMB HAD BEEN STEEP
3526-176651-0001 AS ON THE WHITE MISTS TRAILING UP THE STEEPS BELOW HER BEYOND THEM WAS A GAP IN THE NEXT MOUNTAIN CHAIN AND DOWN IN THE LITTLE VALLEY JUST VISIBLE THROUGH IT WERE TRAILING BLUE MISTS AS WELL AND SHE KNEW
3526-176651-0002 THAT THEY WERE SMOKE WHERE WAS THE GREAT GLARE OF YELLOW LIGHT THAT THE CIRCUIT RIDER HAD TOLD ABOUT AND THE LEAPING TONGUES OF FIRE WHERE WAS THE SHRIEKING MONSTER THAT RAN WITHOUT HORSES LIKE THE WIND
3526-176651-0003 AND TOSSED BACK ROLLING BLACK PLUMES ALL STREAKED WITH FIRE FOR MANY DAYS NOW SHE HAD HEARD STORIES OF THE FURRINERS WHO HAD COME INTO THOSE HILLS AND WERE DOING STRANGE THINGS DOWN THERE AND SO AT LAST
3526-176651-0004 SHE HAD CLIMBED UP THROUGH THE DEWY MORNING FROM THE COVE ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE THE WONDERS FOR HERSELF SHE HAD NEVER BEEN UP THERE BEFORE SHE HAD NO BUSINESS THERE NOW AND IF SHE WERE FOUND OUT WHEN SHE GOT BACK
3526-176651-0005 SHE WOULD GET A SCOLDING AND MAYBE SOMETHING WORSE FROM HER STEP MOTHER AND ALL THAT TROUBLE AND RISK FOR NOTHING BUT SMOKE SO SHE LAY BACK AND RESTED HER LITTLE MOUTH TIGHTENING FIERCELY
3526-176651-0006 IT WAS A BIG WORLD THOUGH THAT WAS SPREAD BEFORE HER AND A VAGUE AWE OF IT SEIZED HER STRAIGHTWAY AND HELD HER MOTIONLESS AND DREAMING BEYOND THOSE WHITE MISTS TRAILING UP THE HILLS
3526-176651-0007 BEYOND THE BLUE SMOKE DRIFTING IN THE VALLEY THOSE LIMITLESS BLUE WAVES MUST RUN UNDER THE SUN ON AND ON TO THE END OF THE WORLD HER DEAD SISTER HAD GONE INTO THAT FAR SILENCE
3526-176651-0008 AND HAD BROUGHT BACK WONDERFUL STORIES OF THAT OUTER WORLD AND SHE BEGAN TO WONDER MORE THAN EVER BEFORE WHETHER SHE WOULD EVER GO INTO IT AND SEE FOR HERSELF WHAT WAS THERE WITH THE THOUGHT SHE ROSE SLOWLY TO HER FEET
3526-176651-0009 MOVED SLOWLY TO THE CLIFF THAT DROPPED SHEER TEN FEET ASIDE FROM THE TRAIL AND STOOD THERE LIKE A GREAT SCARLET FLOWER IN STILL AIR THERE WAS THE WAY AT HER FEET
3526-176651-0010 THAT PATH THAT COILED UNDER THE CLIFF AND RAN DOWN LOOP BY LOOP THROUGH MAJESTIC OAK AND POPLAR AND MASSES OF RHODODENDRON SHE DREW A LONG BREATH AND STIRRED UNEASILY
3526-176651-0011 SHE'D BETTER GO HOME NOW BUT THE PATH HAD A SNAKE LIKE CHARM FOR HER AND STILL SHE STOOD FOLLOWING IT AS FAR DOWN AS SHE COULD WITH HER EYES DOWN IT WENT
3526-176651-0012 WRITHING THIS WAY AND THAT TO A SPUR THAT HAD BEEN SWEPT BARE BY FOREST FIRES ALONG THIS SPUR IT TRAVELLED STRAIGHT FOR A WHILE AND AS HER EYES EAGERLY FOLLOWED IT TO WHERE IT SANK SHARPLY INTO A COVERT OF MAPLES
3526-176651-0013 THE LITTLE CREATURE DROPPED OF A SUDDEN TO THE GROUND AND LIKE SOMETHING WILD LAY FLAT A HUMAN FIGURE HAD FILLED THE LEAFY MOUTH THAT SWALLOWED UP THE TRAIL AND IT WAS COMING TOWARDS HER
3526-176651-0014 WITH A THUMPING HEART SHE PUSHED SLOWLY FORWARD THROUGH THE BRUSH UNTIL HER FACE FOX LIKE WITH CUNNING AND SCREENED BY A BLUEBERRY BUSH HUNG JUST OVER THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF AND THERE SHE LAY
3526-176651-0015 LIKE A CROUCHED PANTHER CUB LOOKING DOWN FOR A MOMENT ALL THAT WAS HUMAN SEEMED GONE FROM HER EYES BUT AS SHE WATCHED ALL THAT WAS LOST CAME BACK TO THEM
3526-176651-0016 AND SOMETHING MORE SHE HAD SEEN THAT IT WAS A MAN BUT SHE HAD DROPPED SO QUICKLY THAT SHE DID NOT SEE THE BIG BLACK HORSE
3526-176651-0017 NOW BOTH MAN AND HORSE HAD STOPPED THE STRANGER HAD TAKEN OFF HIS GRAY SLOUCHED HAT AND HE WAS WIPING HIS FACE WITH SOMETHING WHITE SOMETHING BLUE WAS TIED LOOSELY ABOUT HIS THROAT
3526-176651-0018 SHE HAD NEVER SEEN A MAN LIKE THAT BEFORE HIS FACE WAS SMOOTH AND LOOKED DIFFERENT AS DID HIS THROAT AND HIS HANDS HIS BREECHES WERE TIGHT
3526-176651-0019 WHICH WAS DEEP IN SEAT HIGH BOTH IN FRONT AND BEHIND AND HAD STRANGE LONG HOODED STIRRUPS STARTING TO MOUNT THE MAN STOPPED WITH ONE FOOT IN THE STIRRUP AND RAISED HIS EYES TOWARDS HER SO SUDDENLY THAT SHE SHRANK BACK AGAIN
3526-176651-0020 IN HER WONDER OVER HIM SHE ALMOST FORGOT HERSELF FORGOT TO WONDER WHERE HE WAS GOING AND WHY HE WAS COMING INTO THOSE LONELY HILLS UNTIL AS HIS HORSE TURNED A BEND OF THE TRAIL
3526-176651-0021 SHE SAW HANGING FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SADDLE SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A GUN HE WAS A RAIDER THAT MAN SO CAUTIOUSLY AND SWIFTLY THEN SHE PUSHED HERSELF BACK FROM THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF
3526-176651-0022 SPRANG TO HER FEET DASHED PAST THE BIG TREE AND WINGED WITH FEAR SPED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN LEAVING IN A SPOT OF SUNLIGHT AT THE BASE OF THE PINE
3526-176653-0000 THE FERNS DRENCHED HIS STIRRUPS AS HE BRUSHED THROUGH THEM AND EACH DRIPPING TREE TOP BROKE THE SUNLIGHT AND LET IT DROP IN TENT LIKE BEAMS THROUGH THE SHIMMERING UNDERMIST A BIRD FLASHED HERE AND THERE THROUGH THE GREEN GLOOM
3526-176653-0001 BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND IN THE AIR BUT THE FOOTFALLS OF HIS HORSE AND THE EASY CREAKING OF LEATHER UNDER HIM THE DRIP OF DEW OVERHEAD AND THE RUNNING OF WATER BELOW NOW AND THEN HE COULD SEE THE SAME SLENDER FOOT PRINTS IN THE RICH LOAM
3526-176653-0002 AND HE SAW THEM IN THE SAND WHERE THE FIRST TINY BROOK TINKLED ACROSS THE PATH FROM A GLOOMY RAVINE THERE THE LITTLE CREATURE HAD TAKEN A FLYING LEAP ACROSS IT AND BEYOND HE COULD SEE THE PRINTS NO MORE HE LITTLE GUESSED THAT WHILE HE HALTED TO LET HIS HORSE DRINK
3526-176653-0003 HE TURNED BACK UP THE CREEK AND PASSED SO CLOSE TO WHERE SHE HAD SLIPPED ASIDE INTO THE BUSHES THAT SHE CAME NEAR SHRIEKING BUT HIS EYES WERE FIXED ON A POOL OF THE CREEK ABOVE AND TO HER WONDER HE STROLLED STRAIGHT INTO THE WATER WITH HIS BOOTS ON
3526-176653-0004 PUSHING THE NET IN FRONT OF HIM HE WAS A RAIDER SURE SHE THOUGHT NOW AND HE WAS LOOKING FOR A MOONSHINE STILL AND THE WILD LITTLE THING IN THE BUSHES SMILED CUNNINGLY THERE WAS NO STILL UP THAT CREEK
3526-176653-0005 AND AS HE HAD LEFT HIS HORSE BELOW AND HIS GUN SHE WAITED FOR HIM TO COME BACK WHICH HE DID BY AND BY DRIPPING AND SOAKED TO HIS KNEES THEN SHE SAW HIM UNTIE THE QUEER GUN ON HIS SADDLE PULL IT OUT OF A CASE AND
3526-176653-0006 HER EYES GOT BIG WITH WONDER TAKE IT TO PIECES AND MAKE IT INTO A LONG LIMBER ROD IN A MOMENT HE HAD CAST A MINNOW INTO THE POOL AND WADED OUT INTO THE WATER UP TO HIS HIPS SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SO QUEER A FISHING POLE SO QUEER A FISHERMAN
3526-176653-0007 HOW COULD HE GET A FISH OUT WITH THAT LITTLE SWITCH SHE THOUGHT CONTEMPTUOUSLY BY AND BY SOMETHING HUMMED QUEERLY THE MAN GAVE A SLIGHT JERK AND A SHINING FISH FLOPPED TWO FEET INTO THE AIR IT WAS SURELY VERY QUEER
3526-176653-0008 BUT STOOD STILL WINDING SOMETHING WITH ONE HAND AND AGAIN THE FISH WOULD FLASH INTO THE AIR AND THEN THAT HUMMING WOULD START AGAIN WHILE THE FISHERMAN WOULD STAND QUIET AND WAITING FOR A WHILE AND THEN HE WOULD BEGIN TO WIND AGAIN IN HER WONDER
3526-176653-0009 DROWNING HIM STEPPING BACKWARD AT THE SAME TIME AND A MOMENT LATER THE FISH SLID EASILY OUT OF THE EDGE OF THE WATER GASPING ALONG THE EDGE OF A LOW SAND BANK AND THE FISHERMAN REACHING DOWN WITH ONE HAND CAUGHT HIM IN THE GILLS THEN
3526-176653-0010 HE LOOKED UP AND SMILED AND SHE HAD SEEN NO SMILE LIKE THAT BEFORE HOWDYE LITTLE GIRL ONE BARE TOE WENT BURROWING SUDDENLY INTO THE SAND ONE FINGER WENT TO HER RED MOUTH AND THAT WAS ALL
3526-176653-0011 AND HE SMILED AGAIN CAT GOT YOUR TONGUE HER EYES FELL AT THE ANCIENT BANTER BUT SHE LIFTED THEM STRAIGHTWAY AND STARED AGAIN YOU LIVE AROUND HERE SHE STARED ON
3526-176653-0012 WHERE NO ANSWER WHAT'S YOUR NAME LITTLE GIRL AND STILL SHE STARED
3526-176653-0013 THE STEADY EYES LEAPED ANGRILY BUT THERE WAS STILL NO ANSWER AND HE BENT TO TAKE THE FISH OFF HIS HOOK PUT ON A FRESH MINNOW TURNED HIS BACK AND TOSSED IT INTO THE POOL HIT HAIN'T HE LOOKED UP AGAIN
3526-176653-0014 HIS LINE RANG SUDDENLY JACK SHE CRIED YOU GOT A BITE HE PULLED MISSED THE STRIKE AND WOUND IN THE MINNOW WAS ALL RIGHT SO HE TOSSED IT BACK AGAIN THAT ISN'T YOUR NAME HE SAID
3526-176653-0015 HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD AFFIRMATIVELY A LONG CRY CAME DOWN THE RAVINE
3526-176653-0016 AND THE FISHERMAN WONDERED IF HE HAD HEARD ARIGHT JUNE THE LITTLE GIRL GAVE A SHRILL ANSWERING CRY BUT SHE DID NOT MOVE THAR NOW SHE SAID WHO'S THAT YOUR MAMMY NO TAIN'T

3526-176653-0019 DRAWLED A VOICE FROM THE BUSHES AND IT HAD A TONE THAT MADE THE FISHERMAN WHIRL SUDDENLY A GIANT MOUNTAINEER STOOD ON THE BANK ABOVE HIM WITH A WINCHESTER IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS ARM HOW ARE YOU
3526-176653-0020 THE GIANT'S HEAVY EYES LIFTED QUICKLY BUT HE SPOKE TO THE GIRL YOU GO ON HOME
3526-176653-0021 THE GIRL SHRANK TO THE BUSHES BUT SHE CRIED SHARPLY BACK DON'T YOU HURT HIM NOW DAD HE AIN'T EVEN GOT A PISTOL HE AIN'T NO SHET UP

3526-176653-0044 WHEN HE GOT TO THE BARE CREST OF A LITTLE RISE HE COULD SEE UP THE CREEK A SPIRAL OF BLUE RISING SWIFTLY FROM A STONE CHIMNEY GEESE AND DUCKS WERE HUNTING CRAWFISH IN THE LITTLE CREEK THAT RAN FROM A MILK HOUSE OF LOGS
3526-176653-0045 HALF HIDDEN BY WILLOWS AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST AND A TURN IN THE PATH BROUGHT INTO VIEW A LOG CABIN WELL CHINKED WITH STONES AND PLASTER AND WITH A WELL BUILT PORCH A FENCE RAN AROUND THE YARD
3526-176653-0046 GEE HAW I TELL YE AN OX WAGON EVIDENTLY WAS COMING ON AND THE ROAD WAS SO NARROW THAT HE TURNED HIS HORSE INTO THE BUSHES TO LET IT PASS
3526-176653-0047 STILL THERE WAS NO SOUND OF OX OR WAGON AND THE VOICE SOUNDED LIKE A CHILD'S SO HE WENT ON AT A WALK IN THE THICK SAND AND WHEN HE TURNED THE BUSHES HE PULLED UP AGAIN WITH A LOW LAUGH
3526-176653-0048 IN THE ROAD ACROSS THE CREEK WAS A CHUBBY TOW HAIRED BOY WITH A LONG SWITCH IN HIS RIGHT HAND AND A PINE DAGGER AND A STRING IN HIS LEFT ATTACHED TO THE STRING AND TIED BY ONE HIND LEG WAS A FROG

3526-176653-0053 WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT DAGGER THE BOY'S BREAST HEAVED AND HIS DIRTY FINGERS CLENCHED TIGHT AROUND THE WHITTLED STICK DON'T YOU TALK TO ME THAT A WAY HE SAID WITH AN OMINOUS SHAKE OF HIS HEAD I'LL GUT YE THE FISHERMAN THREW BACK HIS HEAD
3526-176653-0054 AND HIS PEAL OF LAUGHTER DID WHAT HIS STERNNESS FAILED TO DO THE LITTLE FELLOW WHEELED SUDDENLY AND HIS FEET SPURNED THE SAND AROUND THE BUSHES FOR HOME THE ASTONISHED FROG DRAGGED BUMPING AFTER HIM WELL
3607-135982-0000 THE CARS CAME SCUDDING IN TOWARDS DUBLIN RUNNING EVENLY LIKE PELLETS IN THE GROOVE OF THE NAAS ROAD
3607-135982-0001 CAREERING HOMEWARD AND THROUGH THIS CHANNEL OF POVERTY AND INACTION THE CONTINENT SPED ITS WEALTH AND INDUSTRY NOW AND AGAIN THE CLUMPS OF PEOPLE RAISED THE CHEER OF THE GRATEFULLY OPPRESSED THEIR SYMPATHY HOWEVER WAS FOR THE BLUE CARS
3607-135982-0002 THE CARS OF THEIR FRIENDS THE FRENCH THE FRENCH MOREOVER WERE VIRTUAL VICTORS THEIR TEAM HAD FINISHED SOLIDLY THEY HAD BEEN PLACED SECOND AND THIRD AND THE DRIVER OF THE WINNING GERMAN CAR WAS REPORTED A BELGIAN
3607-135982-0003 EACH BLUE CAR THEREFORE RECEIVED A DOUBLE MEASURE OF WELCOME AS IT TOPPED THE CREST OF THE HILL AND EACH CHEER OF WELCOME WAS ACKNOWLEDGED WITH SMILES AND NODS BY THOSE IN THE CAR IN ONE OF THESE TRIMLY BUILT CARS WAS A PARTY OF FOUR YOUNG MEN WHOSE SPIRITS SEEMED TO BE AT PRESENT
3607-135982-0004 IN FACT THESE FOUR YOUNG MEN WERE ALMOST HILARIOUS THEY WERE CHARLES SEGOUIN THE OWNER OF THE CAR ANDRE RIVIERE A YOUNG ELECTRICIAN OF CANADIAN BIRTH A HUGE HUNGARIAN NAMED VILLONA
3607-135982-0005 AND A NEATLY GROOMED YOUNG MAN NAMED DOYLE SEGOUIN WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE HE HAD UNEXPECTEDLY RECEIVED SOME ORDERS IN ADVANCE HE WAS ABOUT TO START A MOTOR ESTABLISHMENT IN PARIS
3607-135982-0006 AND RIVIERE WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE HE WAS TO BE APPOINTED MANAGER OF THE ESTABLISHMENT THESE TWO YOUNG MEN WHO WERE COUSINS WERE ALSO IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE FRENCH CARS VILLONA WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE HE HAD HAD A VERY SATISFACTORY LUNCHEON
3607-135982-0007 AND BESIDES HE WAS AN OPTIMIST BY NATURE THE FOURTH MEMBER OF THE PARTY HOWEVER WAS TOO EXCITED TO BE GENUINELY HAPPY HE WAS ABOUT TWENTY SIX YEARS OF AGE WITH A SOFT LIGHT BROWN MOUSTACHE AND RATHER INNOCENT LOOKING GREY EYES
3607-135982-0008 HIS FATHER WHO HAD BEGUN LIFE AS AN ADVANCED NATIONALIST HAD MODIFIED HIS VIEWS EARLY HE HAD MADE HIS MONEY AS A BUTCHER IN KINGSTOWN AND BY OPENING SHOPS IN DUBLIN AND IN THE SUBURBS HE HAD MADE HIS MONEY MANY TIMES OVER
3607-135982-0009 HE HAD ALSO BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SECURE SOME OF THE POLICE CONTRACTS AND IN THE END HE HAD BECOME RICH ENOUGH TO BE ALLUDED TO IN THE DUBLIN NEWSPAPERS AS A MERCHANT PRINCE HE HAD SENT HIS SON TO ENGLAND TO BE EDUCATED IN A BIG CATHOLIC COLLEGE
3607-135982-0010 AND HAD AFTERWARDS SENT HIM TO DUBLIN UNIVERSITY TO STUDY LAW JIMMY DID NOT STUDY VERY EARNESTLY AND TOOK TO BAD COURSES FOR A WHILE HE HAD MONEY AND HE WAS POPULAR AND HE DIVIDED HIS TIME CURIOUSLY BETWEEN MUSICAL AND MOTORING CIRCLES
3607-135982-0011 HIS FATHER REMONSTRATIVE BUT COVERTLY PROUD OF THE EXCESS HAD PAID HIS BILLS AND BROUGHT HIM HOME
3607-135982-0012 WHO HAD SEEN SO MUCH OF THE WORLD AND WAS REPUTED TO OWN SOME OF THE BIGGEST HOTELS IN FRANCE SUCH A PERSON AS HIS FATHER AGREED WAS WELL WORTH KNOWING EVEN IF HE HAD NOT BEEN THE CHARMING COMPANION HE WAS
3607-135982-0013 VILLONA WAS ENTERTAINING ALSO A BRILLIANT PIANIST BUT UNFORTUNATELY VERY POOR THE CAR RAN ON MERRILY WITH ITS CARGO OF HILARIOUS YOUTH THE TWO COUSINS SAT ON THE FRONT SEAT JIMMY AND HIS HUNGARIAN FRIEND SAT BEHIND
3607-135982-0014 DECIDEDLY VILLONA WAS IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS HE KEPT UP A DEEP BASS HUM OF MELODY FOR MILES OF THE ROAD THE FRENCHMEN FLUNG THEIR LAUGHTER AND LIGHT WORDS OVER THEIR SHOULDERS AND OFTEN JIMMY HAD TO STRAIN FORWARD TO CATCH THE QUICK PHRASE
3607-135982-0015 THIS WAS NOT ALTOGETHER PLEASANT FOR HIM AS HE HAD NEARLY ALWAYS TO MAKE A DEFT GUESS AT THE MEANING AND SHOUT BACK A SUITABLE ANSWER IN THE FACE OF A HIGH WIND BESIDES VILLONA'S HUMMING WOULD CONFUSE ANYBODY THE NOISE OF THE CAR TOO
3607-135982-0016 RAPID MOTION THROUGH SPACE ELATES ONE SO DOES NOTORIETY SO DOES THE POSSESSION OF MONEY THESE WERE THREE GOOD REASONS FOR JIMMY'S EXCITEMENT HE HAD BEEN SEEN BY MANY OF HIS FRIENDS THAT DAY IN THE COMPANY OF THESE CONTINENTALS
3607-135982-0017 AT THE CONTROL SEGOUIN HAD PRESENTED HIM TO ONE OF THE FRENCH COMPETITORS AND IN ANSWER TO HIS CONFUSED MURMUR OF COMPLIMENT THE SWARTHY FACE OF THE DRIVER HAD DISCLOSED A LINE OF SHINING WHITE TEETH
3607-135982-0018 IT WAS PLEASANT AFTER THAT HONOUR TO RETURN TO THE PROFANE WORLD OF SPECTATORS AMID NUDGES AND SIGNIFICANT LOOKS THEN AS TO MONEY HE REALLY HAD A GREAT SUM UNDER HIS CONTROL
3607-135982-0019 BUT JIMMY WHO IN SPITE OF TEMPORARY ERRORS WAS AT HEART THE INHERITOR OF SOLID INSTINCTS KNEW WELL WITH WHAT DIFFICULTY IT HAD BEEN GOT TOGETHER THIS KNOWLEDGE HAD PREVIOUSLY KEPT HIS BILLS WITHIN THE LIMITS OF REASONABLE RECKLESSNESS
3607-135982-0020 AND IF HE HAD BEEN SO CONSCIOUS OF THE LABOUR LATENT IN MONEY WHEN THERE HAD BEEN QUESTION MERELY OF SOME FREAK OF THE HIGHER INTELLIGENCE HOW MUCH MORE SO NOW WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TO STAKE THE GREATER PART OF HIS SUBSTANCE IT WAS A SERIOUS THING FOR HIM
3607-135982-0021 JIMMY HAD A RESPECT FOR HIS FATHER'S SHREWDNESS IN BUSINESS MATTERS AND IN THIS CASE IT HAD BEEN HIS FATHER WHO HAD FIRST SUGGESTED THE INVESTMENT MONEY TO BE MADE IN THE MOTOR BUSINESS POTS OF MONEY MOREOVER SEGOUIN HAD THE UNMISTAKABLE AIR OF WEALTH
3607-135982-0022 JIMMY SET OUT TO TRANSLATE INTO DAYS WORK THAT LORDLY CAR IN WHICH HE SAT HOW SMOOTHLY IT RAN IN WHAT STYLE THEY HAD COME CAREERING ALONG THE COUNTRY ROADS THE JOURNEY LAID A MAGICAL FINGER ON THE GENUINE PULSE OF LIFE
3607-135982-0023 AND GALLANTLY THE MACHINERY OF HUMAN NERVES STROVE TO ANSWER THE BOUNDING COURSES OF THE SWIFT BLUE ANIMAL THEY DROVE DOWN DAME STREET THE STREET WAS BUSY WITH UNUSUAL TRAFFIC LOUD WITH THE HORNS OF MOTORISTS AND THE GONGS OF IMPATIENT TRAM DRIVERS
3607-135982-0024 NEAR THE BANK SEGOUIN DREW UP AND JIMMY AND HIS FRIEND ALIGHTED A LITTLE KNOT OF PEOPLE COLLECTED ON THE FOOTPATH TO PAY HOMAGE TO THE SNORTING MOTOR THE PARTY WAS TO DINE TOGETHER THAT EVENING IN SEGOUIN'S HOTEL AND MEANWHILE JIMMY AND HIS FRIEND WHO WAS STAYING WITH HIM
3607-135982-0025 WERE TO GO HOME TO DRESS THE CAR STEERED OUT SLOWLY FOR GRAFTON STREET WHILE THE TWO YOUNG MEN PUSHED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE KNOT OF GAZERS THEY WALKED NORTHWARD WITH A CURIOUS FEELING OF DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE EXERCISE WHILE THE CITY HUNG ITS PALE GLOBES OF LIGHT ABOVE THEM
3607-135982-0026 IN A HAZE OF SUMMER EVENING IN JIMMY'S HOUSE THIS DINNER HAD BEEN PRONOUNCED AN OCCASION A CERTAIN PRIDE MINGLED WITH HIS PARENTS TREPIDATION A CERTAIN EAGERNESS ALSO TO PLAY FAST AND LOOSE FOR THE NAMES OF GREAT FOREIGN CITIES HAVE AT LEAST THIS VIRTUE
3607-135982-0027 AND AS HE STOOD IN THE HALL GIVING A LAST EQUATION TO THE BOWS OF HIS DRESS TIE HIS FATHER MAY HAVE FELT EVEN COMMERCIALLY SATISFIED AT HAVING SECURED FOR HIS SON QUALITIES OFTEN UNPURCHASEABLE HIS FATHER THEREFORE WAS UNUSUALLY FRIENDLY WITH VILLONA
3607-135982-0028 AND HIS MANNER EXPRESSED A REAL RESPECT FOR FOREIGN ACCOMPLISHMENTS BUT THIS SUBTLETY OF HIS HOST WAS PROBABLY LOST UPON THE HUNGARIAN WHO WAS BEGINNING TO HAVE A SHARP DESIRE FOR HIS DINNER THE DINNER WAS EXCELLENT EXQUISITE
3607-135982-0029 SEGOUIN JIMMY DECIDED HAD A VERY REFINED TASTE THE PARTY WAS INCREASED BY A YOUNG ENGLISHMAN NAMED ROUTH WHOM JIMMY HAD SEEN WITH SEGOUIN AT CAMBRIDGE THE YOUNG MEN SUPPED IN A SNUG ROOM LIT BY ELECTRIC CANDLE LAMPS
3607-135982-0030 THEY TALKED VOLUBLY AND WITH LITTLE RESERVE JIMMY WHOSE IMAGINATION WAS KINDLING CONCEIVED THE LIVELY YOUTH OF THE FRENCHMEN TWINED ELEGANTLY UPON THE FIRM FRAMEWORK OF THE ENGLISHMAN'S MANNER A GRACEFUL IMAGE OF HIS HE THOUGHT AND A JUST ONE
3607-135982-0031 HE ADMIRED THE DEXTERITY WITH WHICH THEIR HOST DIRECTED THE CONVERSATION THE FIVE YOUNG MEN HAD VARIOUS TASTES AND THEIR TONGUES HAD BEEN LOOSENED VILLONA WITH IMMENSE RESPECT BEGAN TO DISCOVER TO THE MILDLY SURPRISED ENGLISHMAN THE BEAUTIES OF THE ENGLISH MADRIGAL
3607-135982-0032 RIVIERE NOT WHOLLY INGENUOUSLY UNDERTOOK TO EXPLAIN TO JIMMY THE TRIUMPH OF THE FRENCH MECHANICIANS THE RESONANT VOICE OF THE HUNGARIAN WAS ABOUT TO PREVAIL IN RIDICULE OF THE SPURIOUS LUTES OF THE ROMANTIC PAINTERS
3607-135982-0033 WHEN SEGOUIN SHEPHERDED HIS PARTY INTO POLITICS HERE WAS CONGENIAL GROUND FOR ALL JIMMY UNDER GENEROUS INFLUENCES FELT THE BURIED ZEAL OF HIS FATHER WAKE TO LIFE WITHIN HIM HE AROUSED THE TORPID ROUTH AT LAST
3607-135982-0034 THE ROOM GREW DOUBLY HOT AND SEGOUIN'S TASK GREW HARDER EACH MOMENT THERE WAS EVEN DANGER OF PERSONAL SPITE THE ALERT HOST AT AN OPPORTUNITY LIFTED HIS GLASS TO HUMANITY AND WHEN THE TOAST HAD BEEN DRUNK HE THREW OPEN A WINDOW SIGNIFICANTLY
3607-135982-0035 THAT NIGHT THE CITY WORE THE MASK OF A CAPITAL THE FIVE YOUNG MEN STROLLED ALONG STEPHEN'S GREEN IN A FAINT CLOUD OF AROMATIC SMOKE THEY TALKED LOUDLY AND GAILY AND THEIR CLOAKS DANGLED FROM THEIR SHOULDERS THE PEOPLE MADE WAY FOR THEM
3607-135982-0036 AT THE CORNER OF GRAFTON STREET A SHORT FAT MAN WAS PUTTING TWO HANDSOME LADIES ON A CAR IN CHARGE OF ANOTHER FAT MAN THE CAR DROVE OFF AND THE SHORT FAT MAN CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE PARTY ANDRE IT'S FARLEY
3607-135982-0037 A TORRENT OF TALK FOLLOWED FARLEY WAS AN AMERICAN NO ONE KNEW VERY WELL WHAT THE TALK WAS ABOUT VILLONA AND RIVIERE WERE THE NOISIEST BUT ALL THE MEN WERE EXCITED THEY GOT UP ON A CAR SQUEEZING THEMSELVES TOGETHER AMID MUCH LAUGHTER
3607-135982-0038 TO A MUSIC OF MERRY BELLS
3607-135982-0039 THEY WERE WALKING OUT OF KINGSTOWN STATION THE TICKET COLLECTOR SALUTED JIMMY HE WAS AN OLD MAN FINE NIGHT SIR IT WAS A SERENE SUMMER NIGHT THE HARBOUR LAY LIKE A DARKENED MIRROR AT THEIR FEET
3607-135982-0040 THEY PROCEEDED TOWARDS IT WITH LINKED ARMS SINGING CADET ROUSSEL IN CHORUS STAMPING THEIR FEET AT EVERY HO HO HOHE VRAIMENT THEY GOT INTO A ROWBOAT AT THE SLIP AND MADE OUT FOR THE AMERICAN'S YACHT THERE WAS TO BE SUPPER MUSIC CARDS
3607-135982-0041 VILLONA SAID WITH CONVICTION IT IS DELIGHTFUL THERE WAS A YACHT PIANO IN THE CABIN VILLONA PLAYED A WALTZ FOR FARLEY AND RIVIERE FARLEY ACTING AS CAVALIER AND RIVIERE AS LADY
3607-135982-0042 THEN AN IMPROMPTU SQUARE DANCE THE MEN DEVISING ORIGINAL FIGURES WHAT MERRIMENT JIMMY TOOK HIS PART WITH A WILL THIS WAS SEEING LIFE AT LEAST THEN FARLEY GOT OUT OF BREATH AND CRIED STOP
3607-135982-0043 A MAN BROUGHT IN A LIGHT SUPPER AND THE YOUNG MEN SAT DOWN TO IT FOR FORM'S SAKE THEY DRANK HOWEVER IT WAS BOHEMIAN THEY DRANK IRELAND ENGLAND FRANCE HUNGARY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA JIMMY MADE A SPEECH A LONG SPEECH
3607-135982-0044 VILLONA SAYING HEAR HEAR WHENEVER THERE WAS A PAUSE THERE WAS A GREAT CLAPPING OF HANDS WHEN HE SAT DOWN IT MUST HAVE BEEN A GOOD SPEECH FARLEY CLAPPED HIM ON THE BACK AND LAUGHED LOUDLY WHAT JOVIAL FELLOWS WHAT GOOD COMPANY THEY WERE CARDS CARDS
3607-135982-0045 THE TABLE WAS CLEARED VILLONA RETURNED QUIETLY TO HIS PIANO AND PLAYED VOLUNTARIES FOR THEM THE OTHER MEN PLAYED GAME AFTER GAME FLINGING THEMSELVES BOLDLY INTO THE ADVENTURE THEY DRANK THE HEALTH OF THE QUEEN OF HEARTS AND OF THE QUEEN OF DIAMONDS
3607-135982-0046 JIMMY FELT OBSCURELY THE LACK OF AN AUDIENCE THE WIT WAS FLASHING PLAY RAN VERY HIGH AND PAPER BEGAN TO PASS JIMMY DID NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHO WAS WINNING BUT HE KNEW THAT HE WAS LOSING BUT IT WAS HIS OWN FAULT FOR HE FREQUENTLY MISTOOK HIS CARDS
3607-135982-0047 THEY WERE DEVILS OF FELLOWS BUT HE WISHED THEY WOULD STOP IT WAS GETTING LATE SOMEONE GAVE THE TOAST OF THE YACHT THE BELLE OF NEWPORT AND THEN SOMEONE PROPOSED ONE GREAT GAME FOR A FINISH THE PIANO HAD STOPPED VILLONA MUST HAVE GONE UP ON DECK
3607-135982-0048 IT WAS A TERRIBLE GAME THEY STOPPED JUST BEFORE THE END OF IT TO DRINK FOR LUCK JIMMY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE GAME LAY BETWEEN ROUTH AND SEGOUIN WHAT EXCITEMENT JIMMY WAS EXCITED TOO HE WOULD LOSE OF COURSE HOW MUCH HAD HE WRITTEN AWAY
3607-135982-0049 THE MEN ROSE TO THEIR FEET TO PLAY THE LAST TRICKS TALKING AND GESTICULATING ROUTH WON THE CABIN SHOOK WITH THE YOUNG MEN'S CHEERING AND THE CARDS WERE BUNDLED TOGETHER THEY BEGAN THEN TO GATHER IN WHAT THEY HAD WON FARLEY AND JIMMY WERE THE HEAVIEST LOSERS
3607-135982-0050 HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD REGRET IN THE MORNING BUT AT PRESENT HE WAS GLAD OF THE REST GLAD OF THE DARK STUPOR THAT WOULD COVER UP HIS FOLLY HE LEANED HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE AND RESTED HIS HEAD BETWEEN HIS HANDS COUNTING THE BEATS OF HIS TEMPLES
3607-135982-0051 THE CABIN DOOR OPENED AND HE SAW THE HUNGARIAN STANDING IN A SHAFT OF GREY LIGHT
3607-29116-0000 LAURA WENT DOWN STAIRS KNOCKED AT THE STUDY DOOR AND ENTERED SCARCELY WAITING FOR THE RESPONSE SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS ALONE WITH AN OPEN BIBLE IN HIS HAND UPSIDE DOWN LAURA SMILED AND SAID FORGETTING HER ACQUIRED CORRECTNESS OF SPEECH IT IS ONLY ME

3607-29116-0016 OH I SAW SENATOR BALLOON HE WILL HELP US I SUPPOSE BALLOON IS A WHOLE HEARTED FELLOW I CAN'T HELP LOVING THAT MAN FOR ALL HIS DROLLERY AND WAGGISHNESS HE PUTS ON AN AIR OF LEVITY SOMETIMES BUT THERE AINT A MAN IN THE SENATE KNOWS THE SCRIPTURES AS HE DOES
3607-29116-0017 HE DID NOT MAKE ANY OBJECTIONS NOT EXACTLY HE SAID SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT HE SAID ASKED LAURA GLANCING FURTIVELY AT HIM CERTAINLY HE SAID HE HAD NO DOUBT IT WAS A GOOD THING IF SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS IN IT IT WOULD PAY TO LOOK INTO IT

3607-29116-0021 I SUPPOSE HE WILL PAINT PUB DOCS ON THEM AND FRANK THEM HOME THAT'S GOOD ECONOMY ISN'T IT YES YES BUT CHILD ALL CONGRESSMEN DO THAT IT MAY NOT BE STRICTLY HONEST INDEED IT IS NOT UNLESS HE HAD SOME PUBLIC DOCUMENTS MIXED IN WITH THE CLOTHES
3607-29116-0022 IT'S A FUNNY WORLD GOOD BYE UNCLE I'M GOING TO SEE THAT CHAIRMAN AND HUMMING A CHEERY OPERA AIR SHE DEPARTED TO HER ROOM TO DRESS FOR GOING OUT BEFORE SHE DID THAT HOWEVER SHE TOOK OUT HER NOTE BOOK AND WAS SOON DEEP IN ITS CONTENTS MARKING DASHING
3607-29116-0023 ERASING FIGURING AND TALKING TO HERSELF FREE I WONDER WHAT DILWORTHY DOES THINK OF ME ANYWAY ONE TWO EIGHT SEVENTEEN
3607-29116-0024 WOULDN'T DILWORTHY OPEN HIS EYES IF HE KNEW SOME OF THE THINGS BALLOON DID SAY TO ME THERE HOPPERSON'S INFLUENCE OUGHT TO COUNT TWENTY THE SANCTIMONIOUS OLD CURMUDGEON SON IN LAW SINECURE IN THE NEGRO INSTITUTION THAT ABOUT GAUGES HIM THE THREE COMMITTEEMEN
3607-29116-0025 SONS IN LAW NOTHING LIKE A SON IN LAW HERE IN WASHINGTON OR A BROTHER IN LAW AND EVERYBODY HAS EM LET'S SEE SIXTY ONE WITH PLACES TWENTY FIVE PERSUADED IT IS GETTING ON WE'LL HAVE TWO THIRDS OF CONGRESS IN TIME DILWORTHY MUST SURELY KNOW I UNDERSTAND HIM
3607-29116-0026 UNCLE DILWORTHY UNCLE BALLOON TELLS VERY AMUSING STORIES WHEN LADIES ARE NOT PRESENT I SHOULD THINK SO M M EIGHTY FIVE THERE I MUST FIND THAT CHAIRMAN QUEER BUCKSTONE ACTS
3607-29116-0027 SEEMED TO BE IN LOVE I WAS SURE OF IT HE PROMISED TO COME HERE AND HE HASN'T STRANGE VERY STRANGE I MUST CHANCE TO MEET HIM TO DAY LAURA DRESSED AND WENT OUT THINKING SHE WAS PERHAPS TOO EARLY FOR MISTER BUCKSTONE TO COME FROM THE HOUSE
3607-29116-0028 BUT AS HE LODGED NEAR THE BOOKSTORE SHE WOULD DROP IN THERE AND KEEP A LOOK OUT FOR HIM WHILE LAURA IS ON HER ERRAND TO FIND MISTER BUCKSTONE IT MAY NOT BE OUT OF THE WAY TO REMARK THAT SHE KNEW QUITE AS MUCH OF WASHINGTON LIFE AS SENATOR DILWORTHY GAVE HER CREDIT FOR
3607-29116-0029 AND MORE THAN SHE THOUGHT PROPER TO TELL HIM SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY THIS TIME WITH A GOOD MANY OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS OF NEWSPAPER ROW AND EXCHANGED GOSSIP WITH THEM TO THEIR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE
3607-29116-0030 THEY WERE ALWAYS TALKING IN THE ROW EVERLASTINGLY GOSSIPING BANTERING AND SARCASTICALLY PRAISING THINGS AND GOING ON IN A STYLE WHICH WAS A CURIOUS COMMINGLING OF EARNEST AND PERSIFLAGE COLONEL SELLERS LIKED THIS TALK AMAZINGLY THOUGH HE WAS SOMETIMES A LITTLE AT SEA IN IT
3607-29116-0031 AND PERHAPS THAT DIDN'T LESSEN THE RELISH OF THE CONVERSATION TO THE CORRESPONDENTS IT SEEMS THAT THEY HAD GOT HOLD OF THE DRY GOODS BOX PACKING STORY ABOUT BALLOON ONE DAY AND WERE TALKING IT OVER WHEN THE COLONEL CAME IN THE COLONEL WANTED TO KNOW ALL ABOUT IT AND HICKS TOLD HIM
3607-29116-0032 AND THEN HICKS WENT ON WITH A SERIOUS AIR COLONEL IF YOU REGISTER A LETTER IT MEANS THAT IT IS OF VALUE DOESN'T IT AND IF YOU PAY FIFTEEN CENTS FOR REGISTERING IT THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO TAKE EXTRA CARE OF IT AND EVEN PAY YOU BACK ITS FULL VALUE IF IT IS LOST ISN'T THAT SO
3607-29116-0033 YES I SUPPOSE IT'S SO WELL SENATOR BALLOON PUT FIFTEEN CENTS WORTH OF STAMPS ON EACH OF THOSE SEVEN HUGE BOXES OF OLD CLOTHES AND SHIPPED THAT TON OF SECOND HAND RUBBISH OLD BOOTS AND PANTALOONS AND WHAT NOT THROUGH THE MAILS AS REGISTERED MATTER
3607-29116-0034 IT WAS AN INGENIOUS THING AND IT HAD A GENUINE TOUCH OF HUMOR ABOUT IT TOO I THINK THERE IS MORE REAL TALENT AMONG OUR PUBLIC MEN OF TO DAY THAN THERE WAS AMONG THOSE OF OLD TIMES A FAR MORE FERTILE FANCY A MUCH HAPPIER INGENUITY
3607-29116-0035 NOW COLONEL CAN YOU PICTURE JEFFERSON OR WASHINGTON OR JOHN ADAMS FRANKING THEIR WARDROBES THROUGH THE MAILS AND ADDING THE FACETIOUS IDEA OF MAKING THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CARGO FOR THE SUM OF ONE DOLLAR AND FIVE CENTS STATESMEN WERE DULL CREATURES IN THOSE DAYS
3607-29116-0036 I HAVE A MUCH GREATER ADMIRATION FOR SENATOR BALLOON YES BALLOON IS A MAN OF PARTS THERE IS NO DENYING IT I THINK SO HE IS SPOKEN OF FOR THE POST OF MINISTER TO CHINA OR AUSTRIA AND I HOPE WILL BE APPOINTED
3607-29116-0037 WHAT WE WANT ABROAD IS GOOD EXAMPLES OF THE NATIONAL CHARACTER JOHN JAY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN WERE WELL ENOUGH IN THEIR DAY BUT THE NATION HAS MADE PROGRESS SINCE THEN BALLOON IS A MAN WE KNOW AND CAN DEPEND ON TO BE TRUE TO HIMSELF
3607-29116-0038 YES AND BALLOON HAS HAD A GOOD DEAL OF PUBLIC EXPERIENCE HE IS AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE HE WAS GOVERNOR OF ONE OF THE TERRITORIES A WHILE AND WAS VERY SATISFACTORY INDEED HE WAS HE WAS EX OFFICIO INDIAN AGENT TOO
3607-29116-0039 WHOSE LAND HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THEM BY THE WHITE MAN IN THE INTERESTS OF CIVILIZATION BUT BALLOON KNEW THEIR NEEDS BETTER HE BUILT A GOVERNMENT SAW MILL ON THE RESERVATION WITH THE MONEY AND THE LUMBER SOLD FOR ENORMOUS PRICES A RELATIVE OF HIS DID ALL THE WORK FREE OF CHARGE
3607-29116-0040 THAT IS TO SAY HE CHARGED NOTHING MORE THAN THE LUMBER WOULD BRING BUT THE POOR INJUNS NOT THAT I CARE MUCH FOR INJUNS WHAT DID HE DO FOR THEM GAVE THEM THE OUTSIDE SLABS TO FENCE IN THE RESERVATION WITH GOVERNOR BALLOON WAS NOTHING LESS THAN A FATHER TO THE POOR INDIANS BUT BALLOON IS NOT ALONE
3607-29116-0041 WE HAVE MANY TRULY NOBLE STATESMEN IN OUR COUNTRY'S SERVICE LIKE BALLOON THE SENATE IS FULL OF THEM DON'T YOU THINK SO COLONEL WELL I DUNNO I HONOR MY COUNTRY'S PUBLIC SERVANTS AS MUCH AS ANY ONE CAN I MEET THEM SIR EVERY DAY AND THE MORE I SEE OF THEM
3607-29116-0042 OF SECURING THEIR SERVICES FEW LANDS ARE SO BLEST THAT IS TRUE COLONEL TO BE SURE YOU CAN BUY NOW AND THEN A SENATOR OR A REPRESENTATIVE BUT THEY DO NOT KNOW IT IS WRONG AND SO THEY ARE NOT ASHAMED OF IT THEY ARE GENTLE AND CONFIDING AND CHILDLIKE
3607-29116-0043 AND IN MY OPINION THESE ARE QUALITIES THAT ENNOBLE THEM FAR MORE THAN ANY AMOUNT OF
3607-29116-0044 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU COLONEL SELLERS WELL HESITATED THE COLONEL I AM AFRAID SOME OF THEM DO BUY THEIR SEATS YES I AM AFRAID THEY DO BUT AS SENATOR DILWORTHY HIMSELF SAID TO ME IT IS SINFUL IT IS VERY WRONG IT IS SHAMEFUL
3607-29116-0045 HEAVEN PROTECT ME FROM SUCH A CHARGE THAT IS WHAT DILWORTHY SAID AND YET WHEN YOU COME TO LOOK AT IT YOU CANNOT DENY THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITHOUT THE SERVICES OF SOME OF OUR ABLEST MEN SIR IF THE COUNTRY WERE OPPOSED TO TO BRIBERY IT IS A HARSH TERM I DO NOT LIKE TO USE IT
3664-11714-0000 HE HAD FOUND AT LAST THAT THE DRAUGHTS CONTAINING DISSOLVED PEARLS WHICH THE QUACK DOCTOR LEONI DI SPOLETO PRESCRIBED FOR HIM AS IF HE DESIRED TO ADAPT HIS REMEDIES RATHER TO THE RICHES OF HIS PATIENT THAN TO HIS NECESSITIES
3664-11714-0001 WERE USELESS AND UNAVAILING AND SO HE HAD COME TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE MUST PART FROM THOSE GENTLE TONGUED WOMEN OF HIS THOSE SWEET VOICED POETS HIS PALACES AND THEIR RICH HANGINGS THEREFORE HE HAD SUMMONED TO GIVE HIM ABSOLUTION FOR HIS SINS
3664-11714-0002 IN A MAN OF LESS HIGH PLACE THEY MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN CALLED CRIMES THE DOMINICAN GIRALAMO FRANCESCO SAVONAROLA IT WAS NOT HOWEVER WITHOUT AN INWARD FEAR AGAINST WHICH THE PRAISES OF HIS FRIENDS AVAILED NOTHING
3664-11714-0003 THAT THE PLEASURE SEEKER AND USURPER AWAITED THAT SEVERE AND GLOOMY PREACHER BY WHOSE WORDS ALL FLORENCE WAS STIRRED AND ON WHOSE PARDON HENCEFORTH DEPENDED ALL HIS HOPE FOR ANOTHER WORLD INDEED SAVONAROLA WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN OF STONE
3664-11714-0004 COMING LIKE THE STATUE OF THE COMMANDANTE TO KNOCK AT THE DOOR OF A DON GIOVANNI AND IN THE MIDST OF FEAST AND ORGY TO ANNOUNCE THAT IT IS EVEN NOW THE MOMENT TO BEGIN TO THINK OF HEAVEN HE HAD BEEN BORN AT FERRARA
3664-11714-0005 HAD FLED FROM HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND HAD TAKEN THE VOWS IN THE CLOISTER OF DOMINICAN MONKS AT FLORENCE THERE WHERE HE WAS APPOINTED BY HIS SUPERIORS TO GIVE LESSONS IN PHILOSOPHY THE YOUNG NOVICE HAD FROM THE FIRST TO BATTLE AGAINST THE DEFECTS OF A VOICE THAT WAS BOTH HARSH AND WEAK
3664-11714-0006 A DEFECTIVE PRONUNCIATION AND ABOVE ALL THE DEPRESSION OF HIS PHYSICAL POWERS EXHAUSTED AS THEY WERE BY TOO SEVERE ABSTINENCE SAVONAROLA FROM THAT TIME CONDEMNED HIMSELF TO THE MOST ABSOLUTE SECLUSION AND DISAPPEARED IN THE DEPTHS OF HIS CONVENT
3664-11714-0007 AS IF THE SLAB OF HIS TOMB HAD ALREADY FALLEN OVER HIM THERE KNEELING ON THE FLAGS PRAYING UNCEASINGLY BEFORE A WOODEN CRUCIFIX FEVERED BY VIGILS AND PENANCES HE SOON PASSED OUT OF CONTEMPLATION INTO ECSTASY AND BEGAN TO FEEL IN HIMSELF
3664-11714-0008 THAT INWARD PROPHETIC IMPULSE WHICH SUMMONED HIM TO PREACH THE REFORMATION OF THE CHURCH NEVERTHELESS THE REFORMATION OF SAVONAROLA MORE REVERENTIAL THAN LUTHER'S WHICH FOLLOWED ABOUT FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS LATER RESPECTED THE THING WHILE ATTACKING THE MAN
3664-11714-0009 AND HAD AS ITS AIM THE ALTERING OF TEACHING THAT WAS HUMAN NOT FAITH THAT WAS OF GOD HE DID NOT WORK LIKE THE GERMAN MONK BY REASONING BUT BY ENTHUSIASM WITH HIM LOGIC ALWAYS GAVE WAY BEFORE INSPIRATION HE WAS NOT A THEOLOGIAN
3664-11714-0010 BUT A PROPHET YET ALTHOUGH HITHERTO HE HAD BOWED HIS HEAD BEFORE THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH HE HAD ALREADY RAISED IT AGAINST THE TEMPORAL POWER TO HIM RELIGION AND LIBERTY APPEARED AS TWO VIRGINS EQUALLY SACRED
3664-11714-0011 THE RESULT OF THIS WAS THAT SO LONG AS LORENZO LIVED IN RICHES HAPPINESS AND MAGNIFICENCE SAVONAROLA HAD NEVER BEEN WILLING WHATEVER ENTREATIES WERE MADE TO SANCTION BY HIS PRESENCE A POWER WHICH HE CONSIDERED ILLEGITIMATE
3664-11714-0012 BUT LORENZO ON HIS DEATHBED SENT FOR HIM AND THAT WAS ANOTHER MATTER THE AUSTERE PREACHER SET FORTH AT ONCE BAREHEADED AND BAREFOOT HOPING TO SAVE NOT ONLY THE SOUL OF THE DYING MAN BUT ALSO THE LIBERTY OF THE REPUBLIC
3664-11714-0013 LORENZO AS WE HAVE SAID WAS AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF SAVONAROLA WITH AN IMPATIENCE MIXED WITH UNEASINESS SO THAT WHEN HE HEARD THE SOUND OF HIS STEPS HIS PALE FACE TOOK A YET MORE DEATHLIKE TINGE
3664-11714-0014 APPEARED ON THE THRESHOLD WHEN HE PERCEIVED HIM LORENZO DEI MEDICI READING IN HIS MARBLE BROW THE INFLEXIBILITY OF A STATUE FELL BACK ON HIS BED BREATHING A SIGH SO PROFOUND THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED IT WAS HIS LAST
3664-11714-0015 THEN HE ADVANCED WITH A SLOW AND SOLEMN STEP TOWARDS THE BED LORENZO WATCHED HIS APPROACH WITH TERROR THEN WHEN HE WAS CLOSE BESIDE HIM HE CRIED O MY FATHER I HAVE BEEN A VERY GREAT SINNER THE MERCY OF GOD IS INFINITE REPLIED THE MONK
3664-11714-0016 YOU BELIEVE THEN THAT GOD WILL FORGIVE MY SINS CRIED THE DYING MAN RENEWING HIS HOPE AS HE HEARD FROM THE LIPS OF THE MONK SUCH UNEXPECTED WORDS YOUR SINS AND ALSO YOUR CRIMES GOD WILL FORGIVE THEM ALL REPLIED SAVONAROLA
3664-11714-0017 GOD WILL FORGIVE YOUR VANITIES YOUR ADULTEROUS PLEASURES YOUR OBSCENE FESTIVALS SO MUCH FOR YOUR SINS
3664-11714-0018 FRANCESCO FRESCOBALDI AND MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED OTHERS WHOSE NAMES WERE NONE THE LESS DEAR TO FLORENCE BECAUSE THEY WERE LESS RENOWNED SO MUCH FOR YOUR CRIMES AND AT EACH OF THESE NAMES WHICH SAVONAROLA PRONOUNCED SLOWLY HIS EYES FIXED ON THE DYING MAN
3664-11714-0019 HE REPLIED WITH A GROAN WHICH PROVED THE MONK'S MEMORY TO BE ONLY TOO TRUE THEN AT LAST WHEN HE HAD FINISHED LORENZO ASKED IN A DOUBTFUL TONE THEN DO YOU BELIEVE MY FATHER THAT GOD WILL FORGIVE ME EVERYTHING BOTH MY SINS AND MY CRIMES
3664-11714-0020 EVERYTHING SAID SAVONAROLA BUT ON THREE CONDITIONS WHAT ARE THEY ASKED THE DYING MAN THE FIRST SAID SAVONAROLA IS THAT YOU FEEL A COMPLETE FAITH IN THE POWER AND THE MERCY OF GOD
3664-11714-0021 MY FATHER REPLIED LORENZO EAGERLY I FEEL THIS FAITH IN THE VERY DEPTHS OF MY HEART THE SECOND SAID SAVONAROLA IS THAT YOU GIVE BACK THE PROPERTY OF OTHERS WHICH YOU HAVE UNJUSTLY CONFISCATED AND KEPT
3664-11714-0022 MY FATHER SHALL I HAVE TIME ASKED THE DYING MAN GOD WILL GIVE IT TO YOU REPLIED THE MONK
3664-11714-0023 EXCLAIMED LORENZO FALLING BACK ON HIS BED AND SHAKING HIS HEAD NEVER THE MONK WITHOUT REPLYING A SINGLE WORD MADE A STEP TO WITHDRAW MY FATHER MY FATHER SAID THE DYING MAN DO NOT LEAVE ME THUS HAVE PITY ON ME HAVE PITY ON FLORENCE SAID THE MONK
3664-11714-0024 BUT MY FATHER CRIED LORENZO FLORENCE IS FREE FLORENCE IS HAPPY FLORENCE IS A SLAVE FLORENCE IS POOR CRIED SAVONAROLA POOR IN GENIUS POOR IN MONEY AND POOR IN COURAGE POOR IN GENIUS BECAUSE AFTER YOU LORENZO
3664-11714-0025 WILL COME YOUR SON PIERO POOR IN MONEY BECAUSE FROM THE FUNDS OF THE REPUBLIC YOU HAVE KEPT UP THE MAGNIFICENCE OF YOUR FAMILY AND THE CREDIT OF YOUR BUSINESS HOUSES POOR IN COURAGE BECAUSE YOU HAVE ROBBED THE RIGHTFUL MAGISTRATES OF THE AUTHORITY WHICH WAS CONSTITUTIONALLY THEIRS
3664-11714-0026 AND DIVERTED THE CITIZENS FROM THE DOUBLE PATH OF MILITARY AND CIVIL LIFE WHEREIN BEFORE THEY WERE ENERVATED BY YOUR LUXURIES THEY HAD DISPLAYED THE VIRTUES OF THE ANCIENTS AND THEREFORE WHEN THE DAY SHALL DAWN WHICH IS NOT FAR DISTANT CONTINUED THE MONK
3664-11714-0027 IT IS NOT I WHO DESIRE IT IT IS THE LORD REPLIED SAVONAROLA COLDLY IMPOSSIBLE IMPOSSIBLE MURMURED LORENZO VERY WELL THEN DIE AS YOU HAVE LIVED CRIED THE MONK IN THE MIDST OF YOUR COURTIERS AND FLATTERERS
3664-11714-0028 LET THEM RUIN YOUR SOUL AS THEY HAVE RUINED YOUR BODY AND AT THESE WORDS THE AUSTERE DOMINICAN WITHOUT LISTENING TO THE CRIES OF THE DYING MAN LEFT THE ROOM AS HE HAD ENTERED IT WITH FACE AND STEP UNALTERED FAR ABOVE HUMAN THINGS HE SEEMED TO SOAR
3664-11714-0029 A SPIRIT ALREADY DETACHED FROM THE EARTH AT THE CRY WHICH BROKE FROM LORENZO DEI MEDICI WHEN HE SAW HIM DISAPPEAR
3664-11714-0030 AND FOUND THEIR FRIEND CONVULSIVELY CLUTCHING IN HIS ARMS A MAGNIFICENT CRUCIFIX WHICH HE HAD JUST TAKEN DOWN FROM THE BED HEAD IN VAIN DID THEY TRY TO REASSURE HIM WITH FRIENDLY WORDS LORENZO THE MAGNIFICENT ONLY REPLIED WITH SOBS
3664-11714-0031 HIS LIPS CLINGING TO THE FEET OF THE CHRIST HE BREATHED HIS LAST IN THE ARMS OF THESE THREE MEN OF WHOM THE MOST FORTUNATE THOUGH ALL THREE WERE YOUNG WAS NOT DESTINED TO SURVIVE HIM MORE THAN TWO YEARS
3664-178355-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN CHAMPION BUFFALO KILLER SHORTLY AFTER THE ADVENTURES MENTIONED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER I HAD MY CELEBRATED BUFFALO HUNT WITH BILLY COMSTOCK A NOTED SCOUT GUIDE AND INTERPRETER
3664-178355-0001 WHO WAS THEN CHIEF OF SCOUTS AT FORT WALLACE KANSAS COMSTOCK HAD THE REPUTATION FOR A LONG TIME OF BEING A MOST SUCCESSFUL BUFFALO HUNTER AND THE OFFICERS IN PARTICULAR WHO HAD SEEN HIM KILL BUFFALOES WERE VERY DESIROUS OF BACKING HIM IN A MATCH AGAINST ME
3664-178355-0002 IT WAS ACCORDINGLY ARRANGED THAT I SHOULD SHOOT HIM A BUFFALO KILLING MATCH AND THE PRELIMINARIES WERE EASILY AND SATISFACTORILY AGREED UPON WE WERE TO HUNT ONE DAY OF EIGHT HOURS BEGINNING AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND CLOSING AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
3664-178355-0003 THE WAGER WAS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A SIDE AND THE MAN WHO SHOULD KILL THE GREATER NUMBER OF BUFFALOES FROM ON HORSEBACK WAS TO BE DECLARED THE WINNER THE HUNT TOOK PLACE ABOUT TWENTY MILES EAST OF SHERIDAN AND AS IT HAD BEEN PRETTY WELL ADVERTISED AND NOISED ABROAD
3664-178355-0004 A LARGE CROWD WITNESSED THE INTERESTING AND EXCITING SCENE AN EXCURSION PARTY MOSTLY FROM SAINT LOUIS CONSISTING OF ABOUT A HUNDRED GENTLEMEN AND LADIES CAME OUT ON A SPECIAL TRAIN TO VIEW THE SPORT AND AMONG THE NUMBER WAS MY WIFE WITH LITTLE BABY ARTA
3664-178355-0005 THE BUFFALOES WERE QUITE PLENTY AND IT WAS AGREED THAT WE SHOULD GO INTO THE SAME HERD AT THE SAME TIME AND MAKE A RUN AS WE CALLED IT EACH ONE KILLING AS MANY AS POSSIBLE A REFEREE WAS TO FOLLOW EACH OF US ON HORSEBACK WHEN WE ENTERED THE HERD AND COUNT THE BUFFALOES KILLED BY EACH MAN
3664-178355-0006 WHEN THEY WERE TO COME UP AS NEAR AS THEY PLEASED AND WITNESS THE CHASE WE WERE FORTUNATE IN THE FIRST RUN IN GETTING GOOD GROUND COMSTOCK WAS MOUNTED ON ONE OF HIS FAVORITE HORSES WHILE I RODE OLD BRIGHAM I FELT CONFIDENT THAT I HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF COMSTOCK IN TWO THINGS
3664-178355-0007 FIRST I HAD THE BEST BUFFALO HORSE THAT EVER MADE A TRACK AND SECOND I WAS USING WHAT WAS KNOWN AT THAT TIME AS THE NEEDLE GUN A BREECH LOADING SPRINGFIELD RIFLE CALIBRE FIFTY IT WAS MY FAVORITE OLD LUCRETIA WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN INTRODUCED TO THE NOTICE OF THE READER
3664-178355-0008 WHILE COMSTOCK WAS ARMED WITH A HENRY RIFLE AND ALTHOUGH HE COULD FIRE A FEW SHOTS QUICKER THAN I COULD YET I WAS PRETTY CERTAIN THAT IT DID NOT CARRY POWDER AND LEAD ENOUGH TO DO EXECUTION EQUAL TO MY CALIBRE FIFTY AT LAST THE TIME CAME TO BEGIN THE MATCH
3664-178355-0009 COMSTOCK AND I DASHED INTO A HERD FOLLOWED BY THE REFEREES THE BUFFALOES SEPARATED COMSTOCK TOOK THE LEFT BUNCH AND I THE RIGHT MY GREAT FORTE IN KILLING BUFFALOES FROM HORSEBACK WAS TO GET THEM CIRCLING BY RIDING MY HORSE AT THE HEAD OF THE HERD SHOOTING THE LEADERS
3664-178355-0010 TILL THEY WOULD FINALLY CIRCLE ROUND AND ROUND ON THIS MORNING THE BUFFALOES WERE VERY ACCOMMODATING
3664-178355-0011 I HAD NURSED MY BUFFALOES AS A BILLIARD PLAYER DOES THE BALLS WHEN HE MAKES A BIG RUN AFTER THE RESULT OF THE FIRST RUN HAD BEEN DULY ANNOUNCED OUR SAINT LOUIS EXCURSION FRIENDS WHO HAD APPROACHED TO THE PLACE WHERE WE HAD STOPPED SET OUT A LOT OF CHAMPAGNE WHICH THEY HAD BROUGHT WITH THEM
3664-178355-0012 AND WHICH PROVED A GOOD DRINK ON A KANSAS PRAIRIE AND A BUFFALO HUNTER WAS A GOOD MAN TO GET AWAY WITH IT WHILE TAKING A SHORT REST WE SUDDENLY SPIED ANOTHER HERD OF BUFFALOES COMING TOWARD US IT WAS ONLY A SMALL DROVE AND WE AT ONCE PREPARED TO GIVE THE ANIMALS A LIVELY RECEPTION
3664-178355-0013 THEY PROVED TO BE A HERD OF COWS AND CALVES WHICH BY THE WAY ARE QUICKER IN THEIR MOVEMENTS THAN THE BULLS WE CHARGED IN AMONG THEM AND I CONCLUDED MY RUN WITH A SCORE OF EIGHTEEN WHILE COMSTOCK KILLED FOURTEEN
3664-178355-0014 WE CAME UP CLOSE TO ANOTHER HERD AS I WAS SO FAR AHEAD OF MY COMPETITOR IN THE NUMBER KILLED I THOUGHT I COULD AFFORD TO GIVE AN EXTRA EXHIBITION OF MY SKILL I HAD TOLD THE LADIES THAT I WOULD ON THE NEXT RUN RIDE MY HORSE WITHOUT SADDLE OR BRIDLE
3664-178355-0015 AND I REMEMBER ONE FAIR LADY WHO ENDEAVORED TO PREVAIL UPON ME NOT TO ATTEMPT IT THAT'S NOTHING AT ALL SAID I I HAVE DONE IT MANY A TIME AND OLD BRIGHAM KNOWS AS WELL AS I WHAT I AM DOING AND SOMETIMES A GREAT DEAL BETTER SO LEAVING MY SADDLE AND BRIDLE WITH THE WAGONS
3664-178355-0016 WE RODE TO THE WINDWARD OF THE BUFFALOES AS USUAL AND WHEN WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF THEM WE DASHED INTO THE HERD I SOON HAD THIRTEEN LAID OUT ON THE GROUND THE LAST ONE OF WHICH I HAD DRIVEN DOWN CLOSE TO THE WAGONS WHERE THE LADIES WERE
3664-178355-0017 IT FRIGHTENED SOME OF THE TENDER CREATURES TO SEE THE BUFFALO COMING AT FULL SPEED DIRECTLY TOWARD THEM BUT WHEN HE HAD GOT WITHIN FIFTY YARDS OF ONE OF THE WAGONS I SHOT HIM DEAD IN HIS TRACKS THIS MADE MY SIXTY NINTH BUFFALO AND FINISHED MY THIRD AND LAST RUN
3664-178355-0018 COMSTOCK HAVING KILLED FORTY SIX AS IT WAS NOW LATE IN THE AFTERNOON COMSTOCK AND HIS BACKERS GAVE UP THE IDEA THAT HE COULD BEAT ME AND THEREUPON THE REFEREES DECLARED ME THE WINNER OF THE MATCH
3664-178355-0019 THEY PREPARED TO DEPART HAVING DECLINED AN INVITATION TO PASS THE NIGHT THERE
3664-178355-0020 HAD ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF THE INDIANS WHO OVERTOOK HIM AND HIS COMPANION WHEN THEY HAD GONE ABOUT HALF A MILE AFTER SURROUNDING THE TWO MEN THEY SUDDENLY ATTACKED THEM THEY KILLED SCALPED AND ROBBED COMSTOCK BUT GROVER ALTHOUGH SEVERELY WOUNDED MADE HIS ESCAPE
3664-178355-0021 OWING TO THE FLEETNESS OF THE EXCELLENT HORSE WHICH HE WAS RIDING THIS SAD EVENT OCCURRED AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT ON OUR WAY BACK TO CAMP WE TOOK WITH US SOME OF THE CHOICE MEAT AND FINEST HEADS
3664-178355-0022 IN THIS CONNECTION IT WILL NOT BE OUT OF PLACE TO STATE THAT DURING THE TIME I WAS HUNTING FOR THE KANSAS PACIFIC I ALWAYS BROUGHT INTO CAMP THE BEST BUFFALO HEADS AND TURNED THEM OVER TO THE COMPANY WHO FOUND A VERY GOOD USE FOR THEM THEY HAD THEM MOUNTED IN THE BEST POSSIBLE MANNER
3664-178355-0023 AND SENT THEM TO ALL THE PRINCIPAL CITIES AND RAILROAD CENTERS IN THE COUNTRY HAVING THEM PLACED IN PROMINENT POSITIONS AT THE LEADING HOTELS DEPOTS AND OTHER PUBLIC BUILDINGS AS A SORT OF TRADE MARK OR ADVERTISEMENT OF THE KANSAS PACIFIC RAILROAD
3664-178355-0024 AND TO DAY THEY ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE TRAVELER ALMOST EVERYWHERE WHENEVER I AM TRAVELING OVER THE COUNTRY AND SEE ONE OF THESE TRADE MARKS I FEEL PRETTY CERTAIN THAT I WAS THE CAUSE OF THE DEATH OF THE OLD FELLOW WHOSE BODY IT ONCE ORNAMENTED
3664-178355-0025 MY SERVICES AS A HUNTER WERE NOT ANY LONGER REQUIRED AT THIS TIME THERE WAS A GENERAL INDIAN WAR RAGING ALL ALONG THE WESTERN BORDERS GENERAL SHERIDAN HAD TAKEN UP HIS HEADQUARTERS AT FORT HAYES IN ORDER TO BE IN THE FIELD TO SUPERINTEND THE CAMPAIGN IN PERSON
3664-178355-0026 AS SCOUTS AND GUIDES WERE IN GREAT DEMAND I CONCLUDED ONCE MORE TO TAKE UP MY OLD AVOCATION OF SCOUTING AND GUIDING FOR THE ARMY HAVING NO SUITABLE PLACE IN WHICH TO LEAVE MY OLD AND FAITHFUL BUFFALO HUNTER BRIGHAM AND NOT WISHING TO KILL HIM BY SCOUTING
3664-178355-0027 I DETERMINED TO DISPOSE OF HIM I WAS VERY RELUCTANT TO PART WITH HIM BUT I CONSOLED MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO RECEIVE HARDER USAGE IN OTHER HANDS THAN HE HAD IN MINE I HAD SEVERAL GOOD OFFERS TO SELL HIM
3664-178355-0028 BUT AT THE SUGGESTION OF SOME GENTLEMEN IN SHERIDAN ALL OF WHOM WERE ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN POSSESSION OF THE HORSE I PUT HIM UP AT A RAFFLE IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM ALL AN EQUAL CHANCE OF BECOMING THE OWNER OF THE FAMOUS STEED THERE WERE TEN CHANCES AT THIRTY DOLLARS EACH AND THEY WERE ALL QUICKLY TAKEN
3664-178355-0029 A PURSE OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS WAS MADE UP TO BE GIVEN TO THE HORSE THAT COULD FIRST REACH WYANDOTTE FOUR MILES DISTANT THE ARRANGEMENT WAS CARRIED OUT AND BRIGHAM WAS ENTERED AS ONE OF THE CONTESTANTS FOR THE PURSE
3664-178355-0030 EVERYBODY LAUGHED AT MISTER BONHAM WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT HE WAS TO RIDE THAT POKY LOOKING PLUG AGAINST THE FIVE THOROUGHBREDS WHICH WERE TO TAKE PART IN THE RACE WHEN ALL THE PRELIMINARIES HAD BEEN ARRANGED THE SIGNAL WAS GIVEN AND OFF WENT THE HORSES FOR WYANDOTTE
3664-178355-0031 FOR THE FIRST HALF MILE SEVERAL OF THE HORSES LED BRIGHAM BUT ON THE SECOND MILE HE BEGAN PASSING THEM ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND ON THE THIRD MILE HE WAS IN ADVANCE OF THEM ALL AND WAS SHOWING THEM ALL THE ROAD AT A LIVELY RATE ON THE FOURTH MILE HIS RIDER LET HIM OUT
3664-178355-0032 AND ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL THE HOME STATION IN WYANDOTTE A LONG WAY AHEAD OF HIS FASTEST COMPETITOR EVERYBODY WAS SURPRISED AS WELL AS DISGUSTED THAT SUCH A HOMELY CRITTER SHOULD BE THE WINNER BRIGHAM OF COURSE HAD ALREADY ACQUIRED A WIDE REPUTATION
3664-178355-0033 AND HIS NAME AND EXPLOITS HAD OFTEN APPEARED IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND WHEN IT WAS LEARNED THAT THIS CRITTER WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE IDENTICAL BUFFALO HUNTING BRIGHAM NEARLY THE WHOLE CROWD ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD HEARD OF HIM BEFORE AND HAD THEY KNOWN HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE RULED HIM OUT
3664-178355-0034 I FINALLY LOST TRACK OF BRIGHAM AND FOR SEVERAL YEARS I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM THREE YEARS AGO WHILE I WAS AT MEMPHIS TENNESSEE I MET A MISTER WILCOX WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE SUPERINTENDENTS OF CONSTRUCTION OF THE KANSAS PACIFIC RAILROAD AND HE INFORMED ME THAT HE OWNED BRIGHAM
3664-178355-0035 ONLY A FEW MILES OUT OF TOWN THE NEXT DAY I RODE OUT WITH MISTER WILCOX AND TOOK A LOOK AT THE GALLANT OLD HORSE HE WAS COMFORTABLY CARED FOR IN MISTER WILCOX'S STABLE AND LOOKED THE SAME CLEVER PONY THAT HE ALWAYS WAS IT SEEMED AS IF HE ALMOST REMEMBERED ME
3664-178355-0036 AND WHENEVER I AGAIN VISIT MEMPHIS I SHALL SURELY GO AND SEE BRIGHAM IF HE IS STILL ALIVE BUT TO RETURN TO THE THREAD OF MY NARRATIVE FROM WHICH I HAVE WANDERED
3664-178366-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SIX SIGHT SEEING GENERAL ORD COMMANDING THE DEPARTMENT OF THE PLATTE AT THE TIME AND WHO HAD BEEN OUT ON THE ALEXIS HUNT HAD SOME BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO AT FORT MC PHERSON
3664-178366-0001 AND I ACCEPTED HIS INVITATION TO RIDE OVER TO THE POST WITH HIM IN AN AMBULANCE ON THE WAY THITHER HE ASKED ME HOW I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN OFFICER'S COMMISSION IN THE REGULAR ARMY HE SAID THAT GENERAL SHERIDAN AND HIMSELF HAD HAD SOME CONVERSATION ABOUT THE MATTER
3664-178366-0002 AND IF I WANTED A COMMISSION ONE COULD EASILY BE PROCURED FOR ME I THANKED GENERAL ORD FOR HIS KINDNESS AND SAID THAT ALTHOUGH AN OFFICER'S COMMISSION IN THE REGULAR ARMY WAS A TEMPTING PRIZE YET I PREFERRED TO REMAIN IN THE POSITION I WAS THEN HOLDING
3664-178366-0003 HAVING DETERMINED TO VISIT NEW YORK I ACTED UPON GENERAL SHERIDAN'S SUGGESTION AND WROTE TO GENERAL STAGER FROM WHOM IN A FEW DAYS I RECEIVED MY RAILROAD PASSES OBTAINING THIRTY DAYS LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM THE DEPARTMENT I STRUCK OUT FOR THE EAST
3664-178366-0004 ON ARRIVING IN CHICAGO IN FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO I WAS MET AT THE DEPOT BY COLONEL M V SHERIDAN WHO SAID THAT HIS BROTHER THE GENERAL HAD NOT YET RETURNED
3664-178366-0005 BUT HAD SENT WORD THAT I WAS TO BE HIS AND THE COLONEL'S GUEST AT THEIR HOUSE WHILE I REMAINED IN CHICAGO I SPENT TWO OR THREE DAYS VERY PLEASANTLY IN THE GREAT CITY OF THE WEST MEETING SEVERAL OF THE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD BEEN OUT ON THE SHERIDAN HUNT IN SEPTEMBER GENERAL STAGER
3664-178366-0006 COLONEL WILSON EDITOR OF THE JOURNAL MISTER SAM JOHNSON GENERAL RUCKER AND OTHERS BY ALL OF WHOM I WAS MOST CORDIALLY RECEIVED AND WELL ENTERTAINED I WAS INTRODUCED TO QUITE A NUMBER OF THE BEST PEOPLE OF THE CITY AND WAS INVITED TO SEVERAL SWELL DINNERS
3664-178366-0007 THAT IT WAS MORE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO FACE THE THRONG OF BEAUTIFUL LADIES
3664-178366-0008 I WAS TO STOP AT NIAGARA FALLS BUFFALO AND ROCHESTER ON MY WAY TO NEW YORK AND HE PROVIDED ME WITH ALL THE NECESSARY RAILROAD PASSES JUST AS I WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE CHICAGO I MET PROFESSOR HENRY A WARD OF ROCHESTER FOR WHOM DURING THE PREVIOUS YEAR OR TWO
3664-178366-0009 I HAD COLLECTED A LARGE NUMBER OF SPECIMENS OF WILD ANIMALS HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO ROCHESTER AND KINDLY VOLUNTEERED TO ACT AS MY GUIDE UNTIL WE REACHED THAT POINT WE SPENT ONE DAY IN VIEWING THE WONDERS OF NIAGARA
3664-178366-0010 AND I HAD THE HONOR OF RECEIVING AN INVITATION TO DINE WITH THE MAYOR ON ARRIVING AT NEW YORK I WAS MET AT THE DEPOT BY MISTER J G HECKSHER WHO HAD BEEN APPOINTED AS A COMMITTEE OF ONE TO ESCORT ME TO THE UNION CLUB
3664-178366-0011 WHERE JAMES GORDON BENNETT LEONARD W JEROME AND OTHERS WERE TO GIVE ME AN INFORMAL RECEPTION AND WHERE I WAS TO MAKE MY HEADQUARTERS DURING MY VISIT IN THE GREAT METROPOLIS I HAD AN ELEGANT DINNER AT THE CLUB ROOMS WITH THE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD BEEN OUT ON THE SEPTEMBER HUNT AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CLUB
3664-178366-0012 HE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE ME AND INSISTED ON MY BECOMING HIS GUEST HE WOULD LISTEN TO NO EXCUSES AND ON INTRODUCING ME TO MESSRS OVERTON AND BLAIR PROPRIETORS OF THE BREVOORT THEY ALSO GAVE ME A PRESSING INVITATION TO MAKE MY HOME AT THEIR HOUSE
3664-178366-0013 I FINALLY COMPROMISED THE MATTER BY AGREEING TO DIVIDE MY TIME BETWEEN THE UNION CLUB THE BREVOORT HOUSE AND NED BUNTLINE'S QUARTERS THE NEXT FEW DAYS I SPENT IN VIEWING THE SIGHTS OF NEW YORK EVERYTHING BEING NEW AND STARTLING
3664-178366-0014 CONVINCING ME THAT AS YET I HAD SEEN BUT A SMALL PORTION OF THE WORLD I RECEIVED NUMEROUS DINNER INVITATIONS AS WELL AS INVITATIONS TO VISIT DIFFERENT PLACES OF AMUSEMENT AND INTEREST BUT AS THEY CAME IN SO THICK AND FAST I SOON BECAME BADLY DEMORALIZED AND CONFUSED
3664-178366-0015 I FOUND I HAD ACCEPTED INVITATIONS TO DINE AT HALF A DOZEN OR MORE HOUSES ON THE SAME DAY AND AT THE SAME HOUR JAMES GORDON BENNETT HAD PREPARED A DINNER FOR ME AT WHICH QUITE A LARGE NUMBER OF HIS FRIENDS WERE TO BE PRESENT
3664-178366-0016 BUT OWING TO MY CONFUSION ARISING FROM THE MANY OTHER INVITATIONS I HAD RECEIVED I FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT AND DINED ELSEWHERE THIS WAS A BAD BREAK BUT I DID NOT LEARN OF MY MISTAKE UNTIL NEXT DAY WHEN AT THE UNION CLUB HOUSE SEVERAL GENTLEMEN AMONG THEM LAWRENCE JEROME
3664-178366-0017 AND WHY I HAD NOT PUT IN AN APPEARANCE AT BENNETT'S DINNER THEY SAID THAT BENNETT HAD TAKEN GREAT PAINS TO GIVE ME A SPLENDID RECEPTION THAT THE PARTY HAD WAITED TILL NINE O'CLOCK FOR ME AND THAT MY NON ARRIVAL CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DISAPPOINTMENT
3664-178366-0018 I APOLOGIZED AS WELL AS I COULD BY SAYING THAT I HAD BEEN OUT ON A SCOUT AND HAD GOT LOST AND HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE DINNER AND EXPRESSED MY REGRET FOR THE DISAPPOINTMENT I HAD CREATED BY MY FORGETFULNESS AUGUST BELMONT THE BANKER BEING NEAR SAID
3664-178366-0019 NEVER MIND GENTLEMEN I'LL GIVE CODY A DINNER AT MY HOUSE THANK YOU SIR SAID I I SEE YOU ARE DETERMINED THAT I SHALL NOT RUN SHORT OF RATIONS WHILE I AM IN THE CITY I'LL BE THERE SURE
3664-178366-0020 BOTH MISTER JEROME AND MISTER HECKSHER TOLD ME THAT I MUST NOT DISAPPOINT MISTER BELMONT FOR HIS DINNERS WERE SPLENDID AFFAIRS I MADE A NOTE OF THE DATE AND AT THE APPOINTED TIME I WAS PROMPTLY AT MISTER BELMONT'S MANSION WHERE I SPENT A VERY ENJOYABLE EVENING
3664-178366-0021 MISTER BENNETT WHO WAS AMONG THE GUESTS HAVING FORGIVEN MY CARELESSNESS INVITED ME TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO THE LIEDERKRANZ MASKED BALL WHICH WAS TO TAKE PLACE IN A FEW EVENINGS AND WOULD BE A GRAND SPECTACLE TOGETHER WE ATTENDED THE BALL AND DURING THE EVENING I WAS WELL ENTERTAINED
3664-178366-0022 THE DANCERS KEPT ON THEIR MASKS UNTIL MIDNIGHT AND THE MERRY AND MOTLEY THRONG PRESENTED A BRILLIANT SCENE MOVING GRACEFULLY BENEATH THE BRIGHT GAS LIGHT TO THE INSPIRITING MUSIC TO ME IT WAS A NOVEL AND ENTERTAINING SIGHT
3664-178366-0023 AND EXHIBITED SOME OF MY BACKWOODS STEPS WHICH ALTHOUGH NOT AS GRACEFUL AS SOME WERE A GREAT DEAL MORE EMPHATIC BUT WHEN I UNDERTOOK TO DO ARTISTIC DANCING I FOUND I WAS DECIDEDLY OUT OF PLACE IN THAT CROWD AND I ACCORDINGLY WITHDREW FROM THE FLOOR
3664-178366-0024 I OCCASIONALLY PASSED AN EVENING AT NIBLO'S GARDEN VIEWING THE MANY BEAUTIES OF THE BLACK CROOK WHICH WAS THEN HAVING ITS LONG RUN UNDER THE MANAGEMENT OF JARRETT AND PALMER WHOSE ACQUAINTANCE I HAD MADE AND WHO EXTENDED TO ME THE FREEDOM OF THE THEATER
3664-178366-0025 NED BUNTLINE AND FRED MAEDER HAD DRAMATIZED ONE OF THE STORIES WHICH THE FORMER HAD WRITTEN ABOUT ME FOR THE NEW YORK WEEKLY THE DRAMA WAS CALLED BUFFALO BILL THE KING OF BORDER MEN WHILE I WAS IN NEW YORK IT WAS PRODUCED AT THE BOWERY THEATER
3664-178366-0026 AND OF COURSE I WAS PRESENT ON THE OPENING NIGHT A PRIVATE BOX HAVING BEEN RESERVED FOR ME THE THEATER WAS PACKED EVERY SEAT BEING OCCUPIED AS WELL AS THE STANDING ROOM THE DRAMA WAS PLAYED SMOOTHLY AND CREATED A GREAT DEAL OF ENTHUSIASM
3664-178366-0027 THE AUDIENCE UPON LEARNING THAT THE REAL BUFFALO BILL WAS PRESENT GAVE SEVERAL CHEERS BETWEEN THE ACTS AND I WAS CALLED ON TO COME OUT ON THE STAGE AND MAKE A SPEECH
3664-178366-0028 AND THAT I SHOULD BE INTRODUCED TO MISTER STUDLEY I FINALLY CONSENTED AND THE NEXT MOMENT I FOUND MYSELF STANDING BEHIND THE FOOTLIGHTS AND IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I LOOKED UP THEN DOWN THEN ON EACH SIDE AND EVERYWHERE I SAW A SEA OF HUMAN FACES
3664-178366-0029 BUT WHAT THEY WERE I COULD NOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME TELL NOR COULD ANY ONE ELSE IN THE HOUSE MY UTTERANCES WERE INAUDIBLE EVEN TO THE LEADER OF THE ORCHESTRA MISTER DEAN WHO WAS SITTING ONLY A FEW FEET IN FRONT OF ME BOWING TO THE AUDIENCE I BEAT A HASTY RETREAT INTO ONE OF THE CANONS OF THE STAGE
3664-178366-0030 I NEVER FELT MORE RELIEVED IN MY LIFE THAN WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE VIEW OF THAT IMMENSE CROWD THAT EVENING MISTER FRELEIGH OFFERED TO GIVE ME FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A WEEK TO PLAY THE PART OF BUFFALO BILL MYSELF
3664-178366-0031 AND THAT HE MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO MAKE AN ACTOR OUT OF A GOVERNMENT MULE I THANKED HIM FOR THE GENEROUS OFFER WHICH I HAD TO DECLINE OWING TO A LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN MYSELF OR AS SOME PEOPLE MIGHT EXPRESS IT I DIDN'T HAVE THE REQUISITE CHEEK TO UNDERTAKE A THING OF THAT SORT
3664-178366-0032 THE PLAY OF BUFFALO BILL HAD A VERY SUCCESSFUL RUN OF SIX OR EIGHT WEEKS AND WAS AFTERWARDS PRODUCED IN ALL THE PRINCIPAL CITIES OF THE COUNTRY EVERYWHERE BEING RECEIVED WITH GENUINE ENTHUSIASM
3664-178366-0033 I MET HIM SOON AFTER HE GOT INTO TOWN IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION HOW I WAS ENJOYING MYSELF I REPLIED THAT I HAD STRUCK THE BEST CAMP I HAD EVER SEEN AND IF HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY OBJECTIONS I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY LEAVE OF ABSENCE EXTENDED ABOUT TEN DAYS
3664-178366-0034 THIS HE WILLINGLY DID AND THEN INFORMED ME THAT MY SERVICES WOULD SOON BE REQUIRED AT FORT MC PHERSON AS THERE WAS TO BE AN EXPEDITION SENT OUT FROM THAT POINT AT WESTCHESTER PENNSYLVANIA I HAD SOME RELATIVES LIVING WHOM I HAD NEVER SEEN
3664-178366-0035 AND NOW BEING SO NEAR I DETERMINED TO MAKE THEM A VISIT UPON MENTIONING THE MATTER TO BUNTLINE HE SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD TOGETHER TAKE A TRIP TO PHILADELPHIA AND THENCE RUN OUT TO WESTCHESTER
3664-178366-0036 AMONG THEM AN ELDERLY LADY WHO WAS MY GRANDMOTHER AS HE INFORMED ME HE TOLD ME THAT MY AUNT ELIZA HIS FIRST WIFE WAS DEAD AND THAT HE HAD MARRIED A SECOND TIME LIZZIE GUSS MY COUSIN I THOUGHT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL I HAD EVER SEEN

3699-175950-0007 AND FEEL PITY FOR THE FORCE OF EDUCATION AND THE PREVALENCE OF OPINIONS LONG DERIVED FROM ANCESTORS FOR THREE GENERATIONS AT LEAST THIS TENET IN FAVOUR OF LONG NOSES
3699-175950-0008 SO THAT THE WHIMSICALITY OF MY FATHER'S BRAIN WAS FAR FROM HAVING THE WHOLE HONOUR OF THIS AS IT HAD OF ALMOST ALL HIS OTHER STRANGE NOTIONS FOR IN A GREAT MEASURE HE MIGHT BE SAID TO HAVE SUCK'D THIS IN WITH HIS MOTHER'S MILK
3699-175950-0009 THAT HE DID NOT CONCEIVE HOW THE GREATEST FAMILY IN ENGLAND COULD STAND IT OUT AGAINST AN UNINTERRUPTED SUCCESSION OF SIX OR SEVEN SHORT NOSES AND FOR THE CONTRARY REASON HE WOULD GENERALLY ADD
3699-175950-0010 THAT IT MUST BE ONE OF THE GREATEST PROBLEMS IN CIVIL LIFE WHERE THE SAME NUMBER OF LONG AND JOLLY NOSES FOLLOWING ONE ANOTHER IN A DIRECT LINE
3699-175950-0011 I MEAN THE EXTERNAL ORGAN OF SMELLING OR THAT PART OF MAN WHICH STANDS PROMINENT IN HIS FACE AND WHICH PAINTERS SAY IN GOOD JOLLY NOSES AND WELL PROPORTIONED FACES SHOULD COMPREHEND A FULL THIRD THAT IS MEASURED DOWNWARDS FROM THE SETTING ON OF THE HAIR
3699-175950-0012 DID HE READ SUCH BOOKS AND OBSERVE SUCH FACTS AND THINK SUCH THOUGHTS AS WOULD ETERNALLY BE MAKING HIM CHANGE SIDES NOW MY FATHER AS I TOLD YOU LAST YEAR DETESTED ALL THIS HE PICK'D UP AN OPINION SIR
3699-175950-0013 AS A MAN IN A STATE OF NATURE PICKS UP AN APPLE IT BECOMES HIS OWN AND IF HE IS A MAN OF SPIRIT HE WOULD LOSE HIS LIFE RATHER THAN GIVE IT UP
3699-175950-0014 THE APPLE IS AS MUCH FRANK'S APPLE AS JOHN'S PRAY MISTER SHANDY WHAT PATENT HAS HE TO SHEW FOR IT AND HOW DID IT BEGIN TO BE HIS WAS IT WHEN HE SET HIS HEART UPON IT OR WHEN HE GATHERED IT
3699-175950-0015 OR WHEN HE CHEW'D IT OR WHEN HE ROASTED IT OR WHEN HE PEEL'D OR WHEN HE BROUGHT IT HOME OR WHEN HE DIGESTED OR WHEN HE FOR TIS PLAIN SIR IF THE FIRST PICKING UP OF THE APPLE MADE IT NOT HIS THAT NO SUBSEQUENT ACT COULD
3699-175950-0016 BROTHER DIDIUS TRIBONIUS WILL ANSWER NOW TRIBONIUS THE CIVILIAN AND CHURCH LAWYER'S BEARD BEING THREE INCHES AND A HALF AND THREE EIGHTHS LONGER THAN DIDIUS HIS BEARD
3699-175950-0017 THAT THE SWEAT OF A MAN'S BROWS AND THE EXSUDATIONS OF A MAN'S BRAINS ARE AS MUCH A MAN'S OWN PROPERTY AS THE BREECHES UPON HIS BACKSIDE
3699-175950-0018 THEY HAD COST HIM MOREOVER AS MUCH LABOUR IN COOKING AND DIGESTING AS IN THE CASE ABOVE SO THAT THEY MIGHT WELL AND TRULY BE SAID TO BE OF HIS OWN GOODS AND CHATTELS ACCORDINGLY HE HELD FAST BY EM BOTH BY TEETH AND CLAWS
3699-175950-0019 WOULD FLY TO WHATEVER HE COULD LAY HIS HANDS ON AND IN A WORD WOULD INTRENCH AND FORTIFY THEM ROUND WITH AS MANY CIRCUMVALLATIONS AND BREAST WORKS AS MY UNCLE TOBY WOULD A CITADEL
3699-175950-0020 BY THE TROTTING OF MY LEAN HORSE THE THING IS INCREDIBLE AND I AM QUITE LOST IN MY UNDERSTANDING WHEN I AM CONSIDERING WHAT A TREASURE OF PRECIOUS TIME AND TALENTS TOGETHER HAS BEEN WASTED UPON WORSE SUBJECTS
3699-175950-0021 WHAT WAS TO BE HAD HOWEVER HE SET THE GREATER STORE BY AND THOUGH MY FATHER WOULD OFT TIMES SPORT WITH MY UNCLE TOBY'S LIBRARY WHICH BY THE BYE WAS RIDICULOUS ENOUGH
3699-175950-0022 BUT THAT WAS NOT THY TRANSGRESSION MY DEAR UNCLE HERE BUT WHY HERE RATHER THAN IN ANY OTHER PART OF MY STORY I AM NOT ABLE TO TELL BUT HERE IT IS MY HEART STOPS ME
3699-175950-0023 WHILST I AM POURING FORTH THE WARMEST SENTIMENT OF LOVE FOR THEE AND VENERATION FOR THE EXCELLENCY OF THY CHARACTER THAT EVER VIRTUE AND NATURE KINDLED IN A NEPHEW'S BOSOM
3699-175950-0024 DEVOUREDST NO MAN'S BREAD GENTLY WITH FAITHFUL TRIM BEHIND THEE DIDST THOU AMBLE ROUND THE LITTLE CIRCLE OF THY PLEASURES JOSTLING NO CREATURE IN THY WAY FOR EACH ONE'S SORROWS THOU HADST A TEAR
3699-175950-0025 FOR EACH MAN'S NEED THOU HADST A SHILLING WHILST I AM WORTH ONE TO PAY A WEEDER THY PATH FROM THY DOOR TO THY BOWLING GREEN SHALL NEVER BE GROWN UP
3699-19401-0000 MY FATHER HAD SUCH A SKIRMISHING CUTTING KIND OF A SLASHING WAY WITH HIM IN HIS DISPUTATIONS THRUSTING AND RIPPING AND GIVING EVERY ONE A STROKE TO REMEMBER HIM BY IN HIS TURN
3699-19401-0001 FOR THAT THE TAYLOR IN RIPPING THEM UP IN ORDER TO TURN THEM HAD FOUND THEY HAD BEEN TURN'D BEFORE THEN TURN THEM AGAIN BROTHER SAID MY FATHER RAPIDLY FOR THERE WILL BE MANY A TURNING OF EM YET BEFORE ALL'S DONE IN THE AFFAIR
3699-19401-0002 THEY ARE AS ROTTEN AS DIRT SAID THE CORPORAL THEN BY ALL MEANS SAID MY FATHER BESPEAK A NEW PAIR BROTHER FOR THOUGH I KNOW CONTINUED MY FATHER TURNING HIMSELF TO THE COMPANY
3699-19401-0003 THAT WIDOW WADMAN HAS BEEN DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH MY BROTHER TOBY FOR MANY YEARS AND HAS USED EVERY ART AND CIRCUMVENTION OF WOMAN TO OUTWIT HIM INTO THE SAME PASSION YET NOW THAT SHE HAS CAUGHT HIM HER FEVER WILL BE PASS'D ITS HEIGHT
3699-19401-0004 INTO A CORPS NO MATTER WHETHER HE LOVES THE SERVICE OR NO BEING ONCE IN IT HE ACTS AS IF HE DID AND TAKES EVERY STEP TO SHEW HIMSELF A MAN OF PROWESSE
3699-19401-0005 THE HYPOTHESIS LIKE THE REST OF MY FATHER'S WAS PLAUSIBLE ENOUGH AND MY UNCLE TOBY HAD BUT A SINGLE WORD TO OBJECT TO IT IN WHICH TRIM STOOD READY TO SECOND HIM BUT MY FATHER HAD NOT DRAWN HIS CONCLUSION
3699-19401-0006 FOR THIS REASON CONTINUED MY FATHER STATING THE CASE OVER AGAIN NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE WORLD KNOWS THAT MISSUS WADMAN AFFECTS MY BROTHER TOBY AND MY BROTHER TOBY CONTRARIWISE AFFECTS MISSUS WADMAN
3699-19401-0007 AND NO OBSTACLE IN NATURE TO FORBID THE MUSIC STRIKING UP THIS VERY NIGHT YET WILL I ANSWER FOR IT THAT THIS SELF SAME TUNE WILL NOT BE PLAY'D THIS TWELVEMONTH
3699-19401-0008 WE HAVE TAKEN OUR MEASURES BADLY QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY LOOKING UP INTERROGATIVELY IN TRIM'S FACE I WOULD LAY MY MONTERO CAP SAID TRIM
3699-19401-0009 NOW TRIM'S MONTERO CAP AS I ONCE TOLD YOU WAS HIS CONSTANT WAGER AND HAVING FURBISH'D IT UP THAT VERY NIGHT IN ORDER TO GO UPON THE ATTACK IT MADE THE ODDS LOOK MORE CONSIDERABLE
3699-19401-0010 I WOULD LAY AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR MY MONTERO CAP TO A SHILLING WAS IT PROPER CONTINUED TRIM MAKING A BOW TO OFFER A WAGER BEFORE YOUR HONOURS THERE IS NOTHING IMPROPER IN IT SAID MY FATHER
3699-19401-0011 THAT WIDOW WADMAN AN PLEASE YOUR WORSHIP CANNOT HOLD IT OUT TEN DAYS AND WHENCE CRIED SLOP JEERINGLY HAST THOU ALL THIS KNOWLEDGE OF WOMAN FRIEND
3699-19401-0012 BY FALLING IN LOVE WITH A POPISH CLERGY WOMAN SAID TRIM TWAS A BEGUINE SAID MY UNCLE TOBY DOCTOR SLOP WAS TOO MUCH IN WRATH TO LISTEN TO THE DISTINCTION
3699-19401-0013 AND MY FATHER TAKING THAT VERY CRISIS TO FALL IN HELTER SKELTER UPON THE WHOLE ORDER OF NUNS AND BEGUINES A SET OF SILLY FUSTY BAGGAGES SLOP COULD NOT STAND IT AND MY UNCLE TOBY HAVING SOME MEASURES TO TAKE ABOUT HIS BREECHES
3699-19401-0014 AND PERHAPS IT IS AS WELL FOR THEE THO NOT SO WELL FOR ME THAT THOU HAST OCCASION FOR A LETTER OF INSTRUCTIONS UPON THAT HEAD AND THAT I AM ABLE TO WRITE IT TO THEE HAD IT BEEN THE GOOD PLEASURE OF HIM WHO DISPOSES OF OUR LOTS
3699-19401-0015 MISSUS SHANDY BEING NOW CLOSE BESIDE ME PREPARING FOR BED I HAVE THROWN TOGETHER WITHOUT ORDER AND JUST AS THEY HAVE COME INTO MY MIND SUCH HINTS AND DOCUMENTS AS I DEEM MAY BE OF USE TO THEE
3699-19401-0016 THOUGH I PERCEIVE FROM A GLOW IN MY CHEEK THAT I BLUSH AS I BEGIN TO SPEAK TO THEE UPON THE SUBJECT AS WELL KNOWING NOTWITHSTANDING THY UNAFFECTED SECRECY HOW FEW OF ITS OFFICES THOU NEGLECTEST
3699-19401-0017 YET I WOULD REMIND THEE OF ONE DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF THY COURTSHIP IN A PARTICULAR MANNER WHICH I WOULD NOT HAVE OMITTED AND THAT IS NEVER TO GO FORTH UPON THE ENTERPRIZE WHETHER IT BE IN THE MORNING OR THE AFTERNOON
3699-19401-0018 WITHOUT FIRST RECOMMENDING THYSELF TO THE PROTECTION OF ALMIGHTY GOD THAT HE MAY DEFEND THEE FROM THE EVIL ONE SHAVE THE WHOLE TOP OF THY CROWN CLEAN
3699-19401-0019 ONCE AT LEAST EVERY FOUR OR FIVE DAYS BUT OFTNER IF CONVENIENT LEST IN TAKING OFF THY WIG BEFORE HER THRO ABSENCE OF MIND SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISCOVER HOW MUCH HAS BEEN CUT AWAY BY TIME HOW MUCH BY TRIM
3699-19401-0020 WHATEVER THOU HAST TO SAY BE IT MORE OR LESS FORGET NOT TO UTTER IT IN A LOW SOFT TONE OF VOICE SILENCE AND WHATEVER APPROACHES IT WEAVES DREAMS OF MIDNIGHT SECRECY INTO THE BRAIN
3699-19401-0021 FOR THIS CAUSE IF THOU CANST HELP IT NEVER THROW DOWN THE TONGS AND POKER AVOID ALL KINDS OF PLEASANTRY AND FACETIOUSNESS IN THY DISCOURSE WITH HER
3699-19401-0022 THEY ARE ALL BOOKS WHICH EXCITE LAUGHTER AND THOU KNOWEST DEAR TOBY THAT THERE IS NO PASSION SO SERIOUS AS LUST STICK A PIN IN THE BOSOM OF THY SHIRT BEFORE THOU ENTEREST HER PARLOUR
3699-19401-0023 THERE IS NOTHING FURTHER FOR THEE WHICH OCCURS TO ME AT PRESENT UNLESS THE BREAKING OUT OF A FRESH WAR SO WISHING EVERY THING DEAR TOBY FOR BEST I REST THY AFFECTIONATE BROTHER WALTER SHANDY
3699-19401-0024 WHILST MY FATHER WAS WRITING HIS LETTER OF INSTRUCTIONS MY UNCLE TOBY AND THE CORPORAL WERE BUSY IN PREPARING EVERY THING FOR THE ATTACK AS THE TURNING OF THE THIN SCARLET BREECHES WAS LAID ASIDE AT LEAST FOR THE PRESENT
3699-19401-0025 THERE WAS NOTHING WHICH SHOULD PUT IT OFF BEYOND THE NEXT MORNING SO ACCORDINGLY IT WAS RESOLV'D UPON FOR ELEVEN O'CLOCK
3699-19401-0026 BUT THE ACCOUNT OF THIS IS WORTH MORE THAN TO BE WOVE INTO THE FAG END OF THE EIGHTH ALLUDING TO THE FIRST EDITION VOLUME OF SUCH A WORK AS THIS
3699-19402-0000 COULD HAVE VENTED SUCH AN INSINUATION HE WAS HOWEVER FRANK AND GENEROUS IN HIS NATURE AND AT ALL TIMES OPEN TO CONVICTION SO THAT HE HAD SCARCE GOT TO THE LAST WORD OF THIS UNGRACIOUS RETORT
3699-19402-0001 WHEN HIS CONSCIENCE SMOTE HIM MY MOTHER WAS THEN CONJUGALLY SWINGING WITH HER LEFT ARM TWISTED UNDER HIS RIGHT IN SUCH WISE THAT THE INSIDE OF HER HAND RESTED UPON THE BACK OF HIS
3699-19402-0002 SHE RAISED HER FINGERS AND LET THEM FALL IT COULD SCARCE BE CALL'D A TAP OR IF IT WAS A TAP
3699-19402-0003 WHETHER TWAS A TAP OF REMONSTRANCE OR A TAP OF CONFESSION MY FATHER WHO WAS ALL SENSIBILITIES FROM HEAD TO FOOT
3699-19402-0004 CONSCIENCE REDOUBLED HER BLOW HE TURN'D HIS FACE SUDDENLY THE OTHER WAY AND MY MOTHER SUPPOSING HIS BODY WAS ABOUT TO TURN WITH IT IN ORDER TO MOVE HOMEWARDS BY A CROSS MOVEMENT OF HER RIGHT LEG
3699-19402-0005 A THIN BLUE CHILL PELLUCID CHRYSTAL WITH ALL ITS HUMOURS SO AT REST THE LEAST MOTE OR SPECK OF DESIRE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN AT THE BOTTOM OF IT HAD IT EXISTED
3699-19402-0006 MY MOTHER MADAM WAS SO AT NO TIME EITHER BY NATURE BY INSTITUTION OR EXAMPLE A TEMPERATE CURRENT OF BLOOD RAN ORDERLY THROUGH HER VEINS IN ALL MONTHS OF THE YEAR
3699-19402-0007 WHICH HAVING LITTLE OR NO MEANING IN THEM NATURE IS OFT TIMES OBLIGED TO FIND ONE AND AS FOR MY FATHER'S EXAMPLE TWAS SO FAR FROM BEING EITHER AIDING OR ABETTING THEREUNTO
3699-19402-0008 THAT TWAS THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF HIS LIFE TO KEEP ALL FANCIES OF THAT KIND OUT OF HER HEAD NATURE HAD DONE HER PART TO HAVE SPARED HIM THIS TROUBLE AND WHAT WAS NOT A LITTLE INCONSISTENT MY FATHER KNEW IT
3699-19402-0009 AND HERE AM I SITTING THIS TWELFTH DAY OF AUGUST SEVENTEEN SIXTY SIX IN A PURPLE JERKIN AND YELLOW PAIR OF SLIPPERS WITHOUT EITHER WIG OR CAP ON A MOST TRAGICOMICAL COMPLETION OF HIS PREDICTION
3699-19402-0010 FOR CERTAINLY KEY HOLES WERE MADE FOR OTHER PURPOSES AND CONSIDERING THE ACT AS AN ACT WHICH INTERFERED WITH A TRUE PROPOSITION AND DENIED A KEY HOLE TO BE WHAT IT WAS
3699-19402-0011 IT BECAME A VIOLATION OF NATURE AND WAS SO FAR YOU SEE CRIMINAL IT IS FOR THIS REASON AN PLEASE YOUR REVERENCES THAT KEY HOLES ARE THE OCCASIONS OF MORE SIN AND WICKEDNESS THAN ALL OTHER HOLES
3699-19402-0012 THOUGH THE CORPORAL HAD BEEN AS GOOD AS HIS WORD IN PUTTING MY UNCLE TOBY'S GREAT RAMALLIE WIG INTO PIPES YET THE TIME WAS TOO SHORT TO PRODUCE ANY GREAT EFFECTS FROM IT IT HAD LAIN MANY YEARS SQUEEZED UP IN THE CORNER OF HIS OLD CAMPAIGN TRUNK
3699-19402-0013 TWOULD HAVE COST HER LADYSHIP A SMILE IT CURL'D EVERY WHERE BUT WHERE THE CORPORAL WOULD HAVE IT AND WHERE A BUCKLE OR TWO IN HIS OPINION WOULD HAVE DONE IT HONOUR HE COULD AS SOON HAVE RAISED THE DEAD
3699-19402-0014 SUCH IT WAS OR RATHER SUCH WOULD IT HAVE SEEM'D UPON ANY OTHER BROW BUT THE SWEET LOOK OF GOODNESS WHICH SAT UPON MY UNCLE TOBY'S ASSIMILATED EVERY THING AROUND IT SO SOVEREIGNLY TO ITSELF
3699-19402-0015 AND NATURE HAD MOREOVER WROTE GENTLEMAN WITH SO FAIR A HAND IN EVERY LINE OF HIS COUNTENANCE THAT EVEN HIS TARNISH'D GOLD LACED HAT AND HUGE COCKADE OF FLIMSY TAFFETA BECAME HIM
3699-19402-0016 IN A PERIOD OF FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN YEARS SINCE THEY HAD BEEN MADE BY A TOTAL INACTIVITY IN MY UNCLE TOBY'S LIFE FOR HE SELDOM WENT FURTHER THAN THE BOWLING GREEN
3699-19402-0017 AND TO SHORTEN ALL DESCRIPTION THEY SHONE SO BRIGHT AGAINST THE SUN THAT MORNING AND HAD SO METALLICK AND DOUGHTY AN AIR WITH THEM THAT HAD MY UNCLE TOBY THOUGHT OF ATTACKING IN ARMOUR NOTHING COULD HAVE SO WELL IMPOSED UPON HIS IMAGINATION
3699-19402-0018 AND WITH HIS HAIR TUCK'D UP UNDER HIS MONTERO CAP WHICH HE HAD FURBISH'D UP FOR THE OCCASION
3699-19402-0019 A WHIFF OF MILITARY PRIDE HAD PUFF'D OUT HIS SHIRT AT THE WRIST AND UPON THAT IN A BLACK LEATHER THONG CLIPP'D INTO A TASSEL BEYOND THE KNOT HUNG THE CORPORAL'S STICK MY UNCLE TOBY CARRIED HIS CANE
3699-19402-0020 LIKE A PIKE IT LOOKS WELL AT LEAST QUOTH MY FATHER TO HIMSELF
3699-19402-0021 MY UNCLE TOBY TURN'D HIS HEAD MORE THAN ONCE BEHIND HIM TO SEE HOW HE WAS SUPPORTED BY THE CORPORAL AND THE CORPORAL AS OFT AS HE DID IT GAVE A SLIGHT FLOURISH WITH HIS STICK
3699-19402-0022 BUT NOT VAPOURINGLY AND WITH THE SWEETEST ACCENT OF MOST RESPECTFUL ENCOURAGEMENT BID HIS HONOUR NEVER FEAR NOW MY UNCLE TOBY DID FEAR AND GRIEVOUSLY TOO
3699-19402-0023 INFINITE WAS HIS PITY NOR WOULD THE MOST COURTEOUS KNIGHT OF ROMANCE HAVE GONE FURTHER AT LEAST UPON ONE LEG TO HAVE WIPED AWAY A TEAR FROM A WOMAN'S EYE
3699-19402-0024 AND YET EXCEPTING ONCE THAT HE WAS BEGUILED INTO IT BY MISSUS WADMAN HE HAD NEVER LOOKED STEDFASTLY INTO ONE AND WOULD OFTEN TELL MY FATHER IN THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS HEART
3699-19402-0025 SHE CANNOT QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY HALTING WHEN THEY HAD MARCH'D UP TO WITHIN TWENTY PACES OF MISSUS WADMAN'S DOOR SHE CANNOT CORPORAL TAKE IT AMISS
3699-19402-0026 YOUR HONOUR REPLIED THE CORPORAL KNOWS OF TOM'S MISFORTUNES BUT THIS AFFAIR HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM ANY FURTHER THAN THIS
3699-19402-0027 THAT IF TOM HAD NOT MARRIED THE WIDOW OR HAD IT PLEASED GOD AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE THAT THEY HAD BUT PUT PORK INTO THEIR SAUSAGES THE HONEST SOUL HAD NEVER BEEN TAKEN OUT OF HIS WARM BED AND DRAGG'D TO THE INQUISITION
3699-19402-0028 WHEN ONCE A POOR CREATURE IS IN HE IS IN AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR FOR EVER TIS VERY TRUE SAID MY UNCLE TOBY LOOKING GRAVELY AT MISSUS WADMAN'S HOUSE AS HE SPOKE NOTHING
3699-19402-0029 SAID MY UNCLE TOBY MUSING WHILST A MAN IS FREE CRIED THE CORPORAL GIVING A FLOURISH WITH HIS STICK THUS
3699-19402-0030 A THOUSAND OF MY FATHER'S MOST SUBTLE SYLLOGISMS COULD NOT HAVE SAID MORE FOR CELIBACY MY UNCLE TOBY LOOK'D EARNESTLY TOWARDS HIS COTTAGE AND HIS BOWLING GREEN
3699-47246-0000 CHAPTER FOUR I AM BY NO MEANS SURE THAT IF THE GOOD PEOPLE OF MILBY HAD KNOWN THE TRUTH ABOUT THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLY DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT IT WAS VERY FAR FROM BEING AS BAD AS THEY IMAGINED
3699-47246-0001 NICE DISTINCTIONS ARE TROUBLESOME IT IS SO MUCH EASIER TO SAY THAT A THING IS BLACK THAN TO DISCRIMINATE THE PARTICULAR SHADE OF BROWN BLUE OR GREEN TO WHICH IT REALLY BELONGS
3699-47246-0002 BESIDES THINK OF ALL THE VIRTUOUS DECLAMATION ALL THE PENETRATING OBSERVATION WHICH HAD BEEN BUILT UP ENTIRELY ON THE FUNDAMENTAL POSITION THAT THE COUNTESS WAS A VERY OBJECTIONABLE PERSON INDEED
3699-47246-0003 AND WHICH WOULD BE UTTERLY OVERTURNED AND NULLIFIED BY THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT PREMISS MISSUS PHIPPS THE BANKER'S WIFE AND MISSUS LANDOR THE ATTORNEY'S WIFE HAD INVESTED PART OF THEIR REPUTATION FOR ACUTENESS
3699-47246-0004 HAD NO COMPENSATING SUPERIORITY IN VIRTUE TO SET AGAINST THE OTHER LADY'S MANIFEST SUPERIORITY IN PERSONAL CHARMS MISS PHIPPS'S STUMPY FIGURE AND UNSUCCESSFUL ATTIRE
3699-47246-0005 INSTEAD OF LOOKING DOWN FROM A MOUNT OF VIRTUE WITH AN AUREOLE ROUND ITS HEAD WOULD THEN BE SEEN ON THE SAME LEVEL AND IN THE SAME LIGHT AS THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI'S DIANA LIKE FORM AND WELL CHOSEN DRAPERY
3699-47246-0006 MISS PHIPPS FOR HER PART DIDN'T LIKE DRESSING FOR EFFECT SHE HAD ALWAYS AVOIDED THAT STYLE OF APPEARANCE WHICH WAS CALCULATED TO CREATE A SENSATION
3699-47246-0007 THEN WHAT AMUSING INNUENDOES OF THE MILBY GENTLEMEN OVER THEIR WINE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY FRUSTRATED AND REDUCED TO NOUGHT IF YOU HAD TOLD THEM THAT THE COUNTESS HAD REALLY BEEN GUILTY OF NO MISDEMEANOURS WHICH DEMANDED HER EXCLUSION FROM STRICTLY RESPECTABLE SOCIETY
3699-47246-0008 HAD SUBSEQUENTLY GIVEN DANCING LESSONS IN THE METROPOLIS THAT MISTER BRIDMAIN WAS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN HER HALF BROTHER WHO BY UNIMPEACHED INTEGRITY AND INDUSTRY
3699-47246-0009 HAD WON A PARTNERSHIP IN A SILK MANUFACTORY AND THEREBY A MODERATE FORTUNE THAT ENABLED HIM TO RETIRE AS YOU SEE TO STUDY POLITICS THE WEATHER AND THE ART OF CONVERSATION AT HIS LEISURE
3699-47246-0010 MISTER BRIDMAIN IN FACT QUADRAGENARIAN BACHELOR AS HE WAS FELT EXTREMELY WELL PLEASED TO RECEIVE HIS SISTER IN HER WIDOWHOOD AND TO SHINE IN THE REFLECTED LIGHT OF HER BEAUTY AND TITLE
3699-47246-0011 EVERY MAN WHO IS NOT A MONSTER A MATHEMATICIAN OR A MAD PHILOSOPHER IS THE SLAVE OF SOME WOMAN OR OTHER MISTER BRIDMAIN HAD PUT HIS NECK UNDER THE YOKE OF HIS HANDSOME SISTER AND THOUGH HIS SOUL WAS A VERY LITTLE ONE
3699-47246-0012 OF THE SMALLEST DESCRIPTION INDEED HE WOULD NOT HAVE VENTURED TO CALL IT HIS OWN HE MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY RECALCITRANT NOW AND THEN AS IS THE HABIT OF LONG EARED PACHYDERMS UNDER THE THONG OF THE FAIR COUNTESS'S TONGUE
3699-47246-0013 AND THERE WAS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY THAT MISTER BRIDMAIN'S FIRST NUPTIALS MIGHT OCCUR BEFORE THE COUNTESS WAS QUITE SURE OF HER SECOND AS IT WAS HOWEVER HE SUBMITTED TO ALL HIS SISTER'S CAPRICES
3699-47246-0014 AS PERSONAGES ON THE DEBATABLE GROUND BETWEEN ARISTOCRACY AND COMMONALTY INSTEAD OF SETTLING IN SOME SPOT WHERE HIS FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR MIGHT HAVE WON HIM THE DEFINITE DIGNITY OF A PAROCHIAL MAGNATE
3699-47246-0015 WHOM HE INITIATED INTO THE MYSTERIES OF THE PAS DE BAS AND THE LANCERS QUADRILLES SHE HAD HAD SEVEN YEARS OF SUFFICIENTLY HAPPY MATRIMONY WITH CZERLASKI WHO HAD TAKEN HER TO PARIS AND GERMANY
3699-47246-0016 NOT INDEED ANY VERY RIPE AND COMPREHENSIVE WISDOM BUT MUCH EXTERNAL POLISH AND CERTAIN PRACTICAL CONCLUSIONS OF A VERY DECIDED KIND
3699-47246-0017 ONE OF THESE CONCLUSIONS WAS THAT THERE WERE THINGS MORE SOLID IN LIFE THAN FINE WHISKERS AND A TITLE AND THAT IN ACCEPTING A SECOND HUSBAND
3699-47246-0018 WAS DIFFICULT TO BE MET WITH AT WATERING PLACES WHICH WERE ALREADY PREOCCUPIED WITH ABUNDANCE OF ANGLING BEAUTIES AND WERE CHIEFLY STOCKED WITH MEN WHOSE WHISKERS MIGHT BE DYED AND WHOSE INCOMES WERE STILL MORE PROBLEMATIC
3699-47246-0019 SO SHE HAD DETERMINED ON TRYING A NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE PEOPLE WERE EXTREMELY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH EACH OTHER'S AFFAIRS AND WHERE THE WOMEN WERE MOSTLY ILL DRESSED AND UGLY
3699-47246-0020 AND GIVE HIM AT LEAST A SORT OF COUSINSHIP TO THE QUARTER SESSIONS ALL THIS WHICH WAS THE SIMPLE TRUTH WOULD HAVE SEEMED EXTREMELY FLAT TO THE GOSSIPS OF MILBY WHO HAD MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO SOMETHING MUCH MORE EXCITING
3699-47246-0021 THERE WAS NOTHING HERE SO VERY DETESTABLE IT IS TRUE THE COUNTESS WAS A LITTLE VAIN A LITTLE AMBITIOUS A LITTLE SELFISH A LITTLE SHALLOW AND FRIVOLOUS A LITTLE GIVEN TO WHITE LIES BUT
3699-47246-0022 WHO CONSIDERS SUCH SLIGHT BLEMISHES SUCH MORAL PIMPLES AS THESE DISQUALIFICATIONS FOR ENTERING INTO THE MOST RESPECTABLE SOCIETY INDEED
3699-47246-0023 THE SEVEREST LADIES IN MILBY WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY AWARE THAT THESE CHARACTERISTICS WOULD HAVE CREATED NO WIDE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI AND THEMSELVES AND SINCE IT WAS CLEAR THERE WAS A WIDE DISTINCTION
3699-47246-0024 WHY IT MUST LIE IN THE POSSESSION OF SOME VICES FROM WHICH THEY WERE UNDENIABLY FREE HENCE IT CAME TO PASS THAT MILBY RESPECTABILITY REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI
3699-47246-0025 IN SPITE OF HER ASSIDUOUS CHURCH GOING AND THE DEEP DISGUST SHE WAS KNOWN TO HAVE EXPRESSED AT THE EXTREME PAUCITY OF THE CONGREGATIONS ON ASH WEDNESDAYS
3699-47246-0026 SO SHE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT SHE HAD MISCALCULATED THE ADVANTAGES OF A NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE PEOPLE ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH EACH OTHER'S PRIVATE AFFAIRS
3699-47246-0027 AND SHUNS A COLDLY SATIRICAL EYE AS SHE WOULD SHUN A GORGON AND SHE WAS ESPECIALLY EAGER FOR CLERICAL NOTICE AND FRIENDSHIP NOT MERELY BECAUSE THAT IS QUITE THE MOST RESPECTABLE COUNTENANCE TO BE OBTAINED IN SOCIETY
3699-47246-0028 AND HAD AN UNEASY SENSE THAT SHE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SAFE IN THAT QUARTER SHE HAD SERIOUS INTENTIONS OF BECOMING QUITE PIOUS WITHOUT ANY RESERVES WHEN SHE HAD ONCE GOT HER CARRIAGE AND SETTLEMENT
3699-47246-0029 THE COUNTESS DID NOT QUOTE SOPHOCLES BUT SHE SAID TO HERSELF ONLY THIS LITTLE BIT OF PRETENCE AND VANITY AND THEN I WILL BE QUITE GOOD AND MAKE MYSELF QUITE SAFE FOR ANOTHER WORLD
3699-47246-0030 FOR YOU HAVE ALREADY PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS ONE BEING TO WHOM THE COUNTESS WAS ABSORBINGLY DEVOTED AND TO WHOSE DESIRES SHE MADE EVERYTHING ELSE SUBSERVIENT NAMELY CAROLINE CZERLASKI NEE BRIDMAIN
3699-47246-0031 THUS THERE WAS REALLY NOT MUCH AFFECTATION IN HER SWEET SPEECHES AND ATTENTIONS TO MISTER AND MISSUS BARTON
3699-47246-0032 STILL THEIR FRIENDSHIP BY NO MEANS ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED THE OBJECT SHE HAD IN VIEW WHEN SHE CAME TO MILBY AND IT HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME CLEAR TO HER THAT SHE MUST SUGGEST A NEW CHANGE OF RESIDENCE TO HER BROTHER
3723-171115-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE DEATH OF JOSEPH HEROD'S BROTHER WHICH HAD BEEN SIGNIFIED TO HEROD IN DREAMS HOW HEROD WAS PRESERVED TWICE AFTER A WONDERFUL MANNER HE CUTS OFF THE HEAD OF PAPPUS
3723-171115-0001 WHO WAS THE MURDERER OF HIS BROTHER AND SENDS THAT HEAD TO HIS OTHER BROTHER PHERORAS
3723-171115-0002 ONE IN THE MEAN TIME HEROD'S AFFAIRS IN JUDEA WERE IN AN ILL STATE HE HAD LEFT HIS BROTHER JOSEPH WITH FULL POWER BUT HAD CHARGED HIM TO MAKE NO ATTEMPTS AGAINST ANTIGONUS TILL HIS RETURN
3723-171115-0003 FOR THAT MACHAERUS WOULD NOT BE SUCH AN ASSISTANT AS HE COULD DEPEND ON AS IT APPEARED BY WHAT HE HAD DONE ALREADY
3723-171115-0004 AND MARCHED TOWARDS JERICHO WITH FIVE COHORTS WHICH MACHAERUS SENT WITH HIM
3723-171115-0005 FOR THESE COHORTS WERE NEW RAISED MEN GATHERED OUT OF SYRIA AND HERE WAS NO MIXTURE OF THOSE CALLED VETERAN SOLDIERS AMONG THEM WHO MIGHT HAVE SUPPORTED THOSE THAT WERE UNSKILLFUL IN WAR TWO
3723-171115-0006 AND THERE DROWNED THEM THERE WAS A GREAT CHANGE MADE ALSO IN IDUMEA WHERE MACHAERUS WAS BUILDING A WALL ABOUT ONE OF THE FORTRESSES WHICH WAS CALLED GITTHA BUT HEROD HAD NOT YET BEEN INFORMED OF THESE THINGS
3723-171115-0007 TO ASSIST HEROD AND FOLLOWED HIMSELF SOON AFTER WITH THE REST OF HIS ARMY THREE NOW WHEN HEROD WAS AT DAPHNE BY ANTIOCH HE HAD SOME DREAMS WHICH CLEARLY FOREBODED HIS BROTHER'S DEATH
3723-171115-0008 AND AS HE LEAPED OUT OF HIS BED IN A DISTURBED MANNER THERE CAME MESSENGERS THAT ACQUAINTED HIM WITH THAT CALAMITY SO WHEN HE HAD LAMENTED THIS MISFORTUNE FOR A WHILE HE PUT OFF THE MAIN PART OF HIS MOURNING AND MADE HASTE TO MARCH AGAINST HIS ENEMIES
3723-171115-0009 HE MADE AN IRRUPTION INTO GALILEE AND MET HIS ENEMIES AND DROVE THEM BACK TO THE PLACE WHICH THEY HAD LEFT
3723-171115-0010 YET WAS HE FORCED BY A MOST TERRIBLE STORM TO PITCH HIS CAMP IN THE NEIGHBORING VILLAGES BEFORE HE COULD TAKE IT BUT WHEN AFTER A FEW DAYS TIME THE SECOND LEGION THAT CAME FROM ANTONY JOINED THEMSELVES TO HIM
3723-171115-0011 HE HAD THE REPUTATION OF BEING VERY DEAR TO GOD FOR THAT EVENING THERE FEASTED WITH HIM MANY OF THE PRINCIPAL MEN AND AFTER THAT FEAST WAS OVER AND ALL THE GUESTS WERE GONE OUT THE HOUSE FELL DOWN IMMEDIATELY
3723-171115-0012 AND BEGAN TO FIGHT WITH THOSE IN HIS FOREFRONT YET DURST THEY NOT BE SO VERY BOLD AS TO ENGAGE THE ROMANS HAND TO HAND BUT THREW STONES AND DARTS AT THEM AT A DISTANCE BY WHICH MEANS THEY WOUNDED A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER
3723-171115-0013 IN WHICH ACTION HEROD'S OWN SIDE WAS WOUNDED WITH A DART FIVE NOW AS ANTIGONUS HAD A MIND TO APPEAR TO EXCEED HEROD NOT ONLY IN THE COURAGE BUT IN THE NUMBER OF HIS MEN HE SENT PAPPUS ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS WITH AN ARMY AGAINST SAMARIA
3723-171115-0014 BUT HEROD OVERRAN THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY AND DEMOLISHED FIVE LITTLE CITIES AND DESTROYED TWO THOUSAND MEN THAT WERE IN THEM AND BURNED THEIR HOUSES AND THEN RETURNED TO HIS CAMP BUT HIS HEAD QUARTERS WERE AT THE VILLAGE CALLED CANA SIX
3723-171115-0015 NOW A GREAT MULTITUDE OF JEWS RESORTED TO HIM EVERY DAY BOTH OUT OF JERICHO AND THE OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY SOME WERE MOVED SO TO DO OUT OF THEIR HATRED TO ANTIGONUS AND SOME OUT OF REGARD TO THE GLORIOUS ACTIONS HEROD HAD DONE
3723-171115-0016 BUT OTHERS WERE LED ON BY AN UNREASONABLE DESIRE OF CHANGE SO HE FELL UPON THEM IMMEDIATELY AS FOR PAPPUS AND HIS PARTY THEY WERE NOT TERRIFIED EITHER AT THEIR NUMBER OR AT THEIR ZEAL BUT MARCHED OUT WITH GREAT ALACRITY TO FIGHT THEM
3723-171115-0017 AND IT CAME TO A CLOSE FIGHT NOW OTHER PARTS OF THEIR ARMY MADE RESISTANCE FOR A WHILE BUT HEROD RUNNING THE UTMOST HAZARD OUT OF THE RAGE HE WAS IN AT THE MURDER OF HIS BROTHER THAT HE MIGHT BE AVENGED ON THOSE THAT HAD BEEN THE AUTHORS OF IT
3723-171115-0018 SOON BEAT THOSE THAT OPPOSED HIM AND AFTER HE HAD BEATEN THEM HE ALWAYS TURNED HIS FORCE AGAINST THOSE THAT STOOD TO IT STILL AND PURSUED THEM ALL SO THAT A GREAT SLAUGHTER WAS MADE WHILE SOME WERE FORCED BACK INTO THAT VILLAGE WHENCE THEY CAME OUT
3723-171115-0019 HE ALSO PRESSED HARD UPON THE HINDERMOST AND SLEW A VAST NUMBER OF THEM HE ALSO FELL INTO THE VILLAGE WITH THE ENEMY WHERE EVERY HOUSE WAS FILLED WITH ARMED MEN AND THE UPPER ROOMS WERE CROWDED ABOVE WITH SOLDIERS FOR THEIR DEFENSE
3723-171115-0020 AND WHEN HE HAD BEATEN THOSE THAT WERE ON THE OUTSIDE HE PULLED THE HOUSES TO PIECES AND PLUCKED OUT THOSE THAT WERE WITHIN UPON MANY HE HAD THE ROOFS SHAKEN DOWN WHEREBY THEY PERISHED BY HEAPS AND AS FOR THOSE THAT FLED OUT OF THE RUINS
3723-171115-0021 THAT THE CONQUERORS COULD NOT PASS ALONG THE ROADS NOW THE ENEMY COULD NOT BEAR THIS BLOW SO THAT WHEN THE MULTITUDE OF THEM WHICH WAS GATHERED TOGETHER SAW THAT THOSE IN THE VILLAGE WERE SLAIN THEY DISPERSED THEMSELVES AND FLED AWAY
3723-171115-0022 UPON THE CONFIDENCE OF WHICH VICTORY HEROD HAD MARCHED IMMEDIATELY TO JERUSALEM
3723-171115-0023 NOW WHEN AT THE EVENING HEROD HAD ALREADY DISMISSED HIS FRIENDS TO REFRESH THEMSELVES AFTER THEIR FATIGUE AND WHEN HE WAS GONE HIMSELF WHILE HE WAS STILL HOT IN HIS ARMOR LIKE A COMMON SOLDIER TO BATHE HIMSELF
3723-171115-0024 ONE OF THE ENEMIES MET HIM IN THE FACE WITH A SWORD IN HIS HAND AND THEN A SECOND AND THEN A THIRD AND AFTER THAT MORE OF THEM THESE WERE MEN WHO HAD RUN AWAY OUT OF THE BATTLE INTO THE BATH IN THEIR ARMOR
3723-171115-0025 AND THEY HAD LAIN THERE FOR SOME TIME IN GREAT TERROR AND IN PRIVACY AND WHEN THEY SAW THE KING THEY TREMBLED FOR FEAR AND RAN BY HIM IN A FLIGHT ALTHOUGH HE WAS NAKED AND ENDEAVORED TO GET OFF INTO THE PUBLIC ROAD
3723-171115-0026 NOW THERE WAS BY CHANCE NOBODY ELSE AT HAND THAT MIGHT SEIZE UPON THESE MEN AND FOR HEROD HE WAS CONTENTED TO HAVE COME TO NO HARM HIMSELF SO THAT THEY ALL GOT AWAY IN SAFETY EIGHT
3723-171115-0027 BUT ON THE NEXT DAY HEROD HAD PAPPUS'S HEAD CUT OFF WHO WAS THE GENERAL FOR ANTIGONUS AND WAS SLAIN IN THE BATTLE AND SENT IT TO HIS BROTHER PHERORAS BY WAY OF PUNISHMENT FOR THEIR SLAIN BROTHER FOR HE WAS THE MAN THAT SLEW JOSEPH
3723-171115-0028 AND THERE IT WAS THAT POMPEY TOOK THE CITY SO HE PARTED THE WORK AMONG THE ARMY AND DEMOLISHED THE SUBURBS
3723-171115-0029 ACQUAINTANCE AT THE WORKS BUT HE WENT HIMSELF TO SAMARIA TO TAKE THE DAUGHTER OF ALEXANDER THE SON OF ARISTOBULUS TO WIFE WHO HAD BEEN BETROTHED TO HIM BEFORE AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID
3723-171115-0030 AND THUS HE ACCOMPLISHED THIS BY THE BY DURING THE SIEGE OF THE CITY FOR HE HAD HIS ENEMIES IN GREAT CONTEMPT ALREADY NINE WHEN HE HAD THUS MARRIED MARIAMNE HE
3723-171115-0031 SOSIUS ALSO JOINED HIM WITH A LARGE ARMY BOTH OF HORSEMEN AND FOOTMEN WHICH HE SENT BEFORE HIM THROUGH THE MIDLAND PARTS WHILE HE MARCHED HIMSELF ALONG PHOENICIA AND WHEN THE WHOLE ARMY WAS GOTTEN TOGETHER
3723-171115-0032 WHICH WERE ELEVEN REGIMENTS OF FOOTMEN AND SIX THOUSAND HORSEMEN BESIDES THE SYRIAN AUXILIARIES WHICH WERE NO SMALL PART OF THE ARMY THEY PITCHED THEIR CAMP NEAR TO THE NORTH WALL HEROD'S DEPENDENCE WAS UPON THE DECREE OF THE SENATE
3723-171115-0033 BY WHICH HE WAS MADE KING AND SOSIUS RELIED UPON ANTONY WHO SENT THE ARMY THAT WAS UNDER HIM TO HEROD'S ASSISTANCE CHAPTER EIGHTEEN HOW HEROD AND SOSIUS TOOK JERUSALEM BY FORCE
3723-171115-0034 BEING THE WEAKER PART OF THEM GAVE IT OUT THAT AS THE TIMES WERE HE WAS THE HAPPIEST AND MOST RELIGIOUS MAN WHO SHOULD DIE FIRST BUT AS TO THE MORE BOLD AND HARDY MEN THEY GOT TOGETHER IN BODIES AND FELL A ROBBING OTHERS AFTER VARIOUS MANNERS
3723-171115-0035 AND THESE PARTICULARLY PLUNDERED THE PLACES THAT WERE ABOUT THE CITY AND THIS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO FOOD LEFT EITHER FOR THE HORSES OR THE MEN YET SOME OF THE WARLIKE MEN WHO WERE USED TO FIGHT REGULARLY WERE APPOINTED TO DEFEND THE CITY DURING THE SIEGE
3723-171115-0036 NOW AS FOR THE ROBBERIES WHICH WERE COMMITTED THE KING CONTRIVED THAT AMBUSHES SHOULD BE SO LAID THAT THEY MIGHT RESTRAIN THEIR EXCURSIONS AND AS FOR THE WANT OF PROVISIONS HE PROVIDED THAT THEY SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO THEM FROM GREAT DISTANCES
3723-171115-0037 HE WAS ALSO TOO HARD FOR THE JEWS BY THE ROMANS SKILL IN THE ART OF WAR ALTHOUGH THEY WERE BOLD TO THE UTMOST DEGREE NOW THEY DURST NOT COME TO A PLAIN BATTLE WITH THE ROMANS WHICH WAS CERTAIN DEATH
3723-171115-0038 BUT THROUGH THEIR MINES UNDER GROUND THEY WOULD APPEAR IN THE MIDST OF THEM ON THE SUDDEN AND BEFORE THEY COULD BATTER DOWN ONE WALL THEY BUILT THEM ANOTHER IN ITS STEAD AND TO SUM UP ALL AT ONCE
3723-171115-0039 THEY BORE A SIEGE OF FIVE MONTHS TILL SOME OF HEROD'S CHOSEN MEN VENTURED TO GET UPON THE WALL AND FELL INTO THE CITY AS DID SOSIUS'S CENTURIONS AFTER THEM
3723-171115-0040 AND NOW THEY FIRST OF ALL SEIZED UPON WHAT WAS ABOUT THE TEMPLE AND UPON THE POURING IN OF THE ARMY THERE WAS SLAUGHTER OF VAST MULTITUDES EVERY WHERE BY REASON OF THE RAGE THE ROMANS WERE IN AT THE LENGTH OF THIS SIEGE
3723-171115-0041 AND BY REASON THAT THE JEWS WHO WERE ABOUT HEROD EARNESTLY ENDEAVORED THAT NONE OF THEIR ADVERSARIES MIGHT REMAIN SO THEY WERE CUT TO PIECES BY GREAT MULTITUDES AS THEY WERE CROWDED TOGETHER IN NARROW STREETS AND IN HOUSES OR WERE RUNNING AWAY TO THE TEMPLE
3723-171115-0042 NOBODY COULD BE PERSUADED TO WITHHOLD THEIR RIGHT HAND FROM SLAUGHTER BUT THEY SLEW PEOPLE OF ALL AGES LIKE MADMEN THEN IT WAS THAT ANTIGONUS WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO HIS FORMER OR TO HIS PRESENT FORTUNE CAME DOWN FROM THE CITADEL
3723-171115-0043 OR LET HIM GO FREE BUT PUT HIM INTO BONDS AND KEPT HIM IN CUSTODY THREE BUT HEROD'S CONCERN AT PRESENT NOW HE HAD GOTTEN HIS ENEMIES UNDER HIS POWER
3723-171115-0044 WAS TO RESTRAIN THE ZEAL OF HIS FOREIGN AUXILIARIES FOR THE MULTITUDE OF THE STRANGE PEOPLE WERE VERY EAGER TO SEE THE TEMPLE AND WHAT WAS SACRED IN THE HOLY HOUSE ITSELF BUT THE KING ENDEAVORED TO RESTRAIN THEM PARTLY BY HIS EXHORTATIONS
3723-171115-0045 PARTLY BY HIS THREATENINGS NAY PARTLY BY FORCE AS THINKING THE VICTORY WORSE THAN A DEFEAT TO HIM IF ANY THING THAT OUGHT NOT TO BE SEEN WERE SEEN BY THEM
3723-171115-0046 HE ALSO FORBADE AT THE SAME TIME THE SPOILING OF THE CITY ASKING SOSIUS IN THE MOST EARNEST MANNER WHETHER THE ROMANS BY THUS EMPTYING THE CITY OF MONEY AND MEN HAD A MIND TO LEAVE HIM KING OF A DESERT
3723-171115-0047 AND TOLD HIM THAT HE JUDGED THE DOMINION OF THE HABITABLE EARTH TOO SMALL A COMPENSATION FOR THE SLAUGHTER OF SO MANY CITIZENS
3723-171115-0048 HEROD MADE ANSWER THAT HE WOULD GIVE EVERY ONE OF THE SOLDIERS A REWARD OUT OF HIS OWN MONEY SO HE PURCHASED THE DELIVERANCE OF HIS COUNTRY AND PERFORMED HIS PROMISES TO THEM AND MADE PRESENTS AFTER A MAGNIFICENT MANNER TO EACH SOLDIER
3723-171115-0049 AND PROPORTIONABLY TO THEIR COMMANDERS AND WITH A MOST ROYAL BOUNTY TO SOSIUS HIMSELF WHEREBY NOBODY WENT AWAY BUT IN A WEALTHY CONDITION HEREUPON SOSIUS DEDICATED A CROWN OF GOLD TO GOD AND THEN WENT AWAY FROM JERUSALEM
3723-171115-0050 LEADING ANTIGONUS AWAY IN BONDS TO ANTONY THEN DID THE AXE BRING HIM TO HIS END
3723-171115-0051 WHO STILL HAD A FOND DESIRE OF LIFE AND SOME FRIGID HOPES OF IT TO THE LAST BUT BY HIS COWARDLY BEHAVIOR WELL DESERVED TO DIE BY IT FOUR
3723-171115-0052 HEREUPON KING HEROD DISTINGUISHED THE MULTITUDE THAT WAS IN THE CITY
3723-171115-0053 NOW CLEOPATRA HAD PUT TO DEATH ALL HER KINDRED TILL NO ONE NEAR HER IN BLOOD REMAINED ALIVE AND AFTER THAT SHE FELL A SLAYING THOSE NO WAY RELATED TO HER SO SHE CALUMNIATED THE PRINCIPAL MEN AMONG THE SYRIANS TO ANTONY
3723-171115-0054 AND PERSUADED HIM TO HAVE THEM SLAIN THAT SO SHE MIGHT EASILY GAIN TO BE MISTRESS OF WHAT THEY HAD NAY SHE EXTENDED HER AVARICIOUS HUMOR TO THE JEWS AND ARABIANS
3723-171115-0055 AND SECRETLY LABORED TO HAVE HEROD AND MALICHUS THE KINGS OF BOTH THOSE NATIONS SLAIN BY HIS ORDER FIVE NOW IS TO THESE HER INJUNCTIONS TO ANTONY HE COMPLIED IN PART
3723-171115-0056 AND HAD CONDUCTED ANTONY IN HIS EXPEDITION AGAINST THE PARTHIANS AS FAR AS EUPHRATES SHE CAME BY APAMIA AND DAMASCUS INTO JUDEA AND THERE DID HEROD PACIFY HER INDIGNATION AT HIM BY LARGE PRESENTS
3723-171115-0057 NOW IT WAS NOT LONG AFTER THIS THAT ANTONY WAS COME BACK FROM PARTHIA
3723-171631-0000 MINISTRANT ARS ET NATURA INSTILLANT THEY USE CORDIALS TO KEEP THE VENOM AND MALIGNITY OF THE DISEASE FROM THE HEART ELEVEN MEDITATION
3723-171631-0001 WHENCE CAN WE TAKE A BETTER ARGUMENT A CLEARER DEMONSTRATION THAT ALL THE GREATNESS OF THIS WORLD IS BUILT UPON OPINION OF OTHERS AND HATH IN ITSELF NO REAL BEING NOR POWER OF SUBSISTENCE
3723-171631-0002 THAN FROM THE HEART OF MAN IT IS ALWAYS IN ACTION AND MOTION STILL BUSY STILL PRETENDING TO DO ALL TO FURNISH ALL THE POWERS AND FACULTIES WITH ALL THAT THEY HAVE
3723-171631-0003 BUT IF AN ENEMY DARE RISE UP AGAINST IT IT IS THE SOONEST ENDANGERED THE SOONEST DEFEATED OF ANY PART THE BRAIN WILL HOLD OUT LONGER THAN IT AND THE LIVER LONGER THAN THAT THEY WILL ENDURE A SIEGE
3723-171631-0004 BUT AN UNNATURAL HEAT A REBELLIOUS HEAT WILL BLOW UP THE HEART LIKE A MINE IN A MINUTE BUT HOWSOEVER SINCE THE HEART HATH THE BIRTHRIGHT AND PRIMOGENITURE AND THAT IT IS NATURE'S ELDEST SON IN US
3723-171631-0005 THE PART WHICH IS FIRST BORN TO LIFE IN MAN AND THAT THE OTHER PARTS AS YOUNGER BRETHREN AND SERVANTS IN HIS FAMILY HAVE A DEPENDANCE UPON IT IT IS REASON THAT THE PRINCIPAL CARE BE HAD OF IT
3723-171631-0006 THOUGH IT BE NOT THE STRONGEST PART AS THE ELDEST IS OFTENTIMES NOT THE STRONGEST OF THE FAMILY AND SINCE THE BRAIN AND LIVER AND HEART HOLD NOT A TRIUMVIRATE IN MAN A SOVEREIGNTY EQUALLY SHED UPON THEM ALL
3723-171631-0007 MUST CONTRIBUTE TO THAT AS CHILDREN TO THEIR PARENTS AS ALL PERSONS TO ALL KINDS OF SUPERIORS THOUGH OFTENTIMES THOSE PARENTS OR THOSE SUPERIORS
3723-171631-0008 THAT SERVE AND OBEY THEM THAT ARE WEAKER NEITHER DOTH THIS OBLIGATION FALL UPON US BY SECOND DICTATES OF NATURE BY CONSEQUENCES AND CONCLUSIONS ARISING OUT OF NATURE OR DERIVED FROM NATURE BY DISCOURSE
3723-171631-0009 AS ALL LAWS OF PROPRIETY IN THAT WHICH WE POSSESS ARE OF THE LAW OF NATURE WHICH LAW IS TO GIVE EVERY ONE HIS OWN AND YET IN THE PRIMARY LAW OF NATURE THERE WAS NO PROPRIETY
3723-171631-0010 NO MEUM ET TUUM BUT AN UNIVERSAL COMMUNITY OVERALL
3723-171631-0011 WHICH IS IN THE FIRST PLACE TO HAVE CARE OF OUR OWN PRESERVATION TO LOOK FIRST TO OURSELVES FOR THEREFORE DOTH THE PHYSICIAN INTERMIT THE PRESENT CARE OF BRAIN OR LIVER
3723-171631-0012 BECAUSE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THEY MAY SUBSIST THOUGH THERE BE NOT A PRESENT AND A PARTICULAR CARE HAD OF THEM BUT THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY THAT THEY CAN SUBSIST IF THE HEART PERISH
3723-171631-0013 AND THIS IS THE REWARD OF THE PAINS OF KINGS SOMETIMES THEY NEED THE POWER OF LAW TO BE OBEYED AND WHEN THEY SEEM TO BE OBEYED VOLUNTARILY THEY WHO DO IT DO IT FOR THEIR OWN SAKES
3723-171631-0014 O HOW LITTLE A THING IS ALL THE GREATNESS OF MAN AND THROUGH HOW FALSE GLASSES DOTH HE MAKE SHIFT TO MULTIPLY IT AND MAGNIFY IT TO HIMSELF AND YET THIS IS ALSO ANOTHER MISERY OF THIS KING OF MAN
3723-171631-0015 THE HEART WHICH IS ALSO APPLICABLE TO THE KINGS OF THIS WORLD GREAT MEN THAT THE VENOM AND POISON OF EVERY PESTILENTIAL DISEASE DIRECTS ITSELF TO THE HEART AFFECTS THAT PERNICIOUS AFFECTION
3723-171631-0016 AND THE MALIGNITY OF ILL MEN IS ALSO DIRECTED UPON THE GREATEST AND THE BEST AND NOT ONLY GREATNESS BUT GOODNESS LOSES THE VIGOUR OF BEING AN ANTIDOTE OR CORDIAL AGAINST IT
3723-171631-0017 AND AS THE NOBLEST AND MOST GENEROUS CORDIALS THAT NATURE OR ART AFFORD OR CAN PREPARE IF THEY BE OFTEN TAKEN AND MADE FAMILIAR BECOME NO CORDIALS NOR HAVE ANY EXTRAORDINARY OPERATION
3723-171631-0018 SO THE GREATEST CORDIAL OF THE HEART PATIENCE IF IT BE MUCH EXERCISED EXALTS THE VENOM AND THE MALIGNITY OF THE ENEMY AND THE MORE WE SUFFER THE MORE WE ARE INSULTED UPON WHEN GOD HAD MADE THIS EARTH OF NOTHING
3723-171631-0019 IT WAS BUT A LITTLE HELP THAT HE HAD TO MAKE OTHER THINGS OF THIS EARTH NOTHING CAN BE NEARER NOTHING THAN THIS EARTH AND YET HOW LITTLE OF THIS EARTH IS THE GREATEST MAN HE THINKS HE TREADS UPON THE EARTH
3723-171631-0020 THAT ALL IS UNDER HIS FEET AND THE BRAIN THAT THINKS SO IS BUT EARTH HIS HIGHEST REGION THE FLESH THAT COVERS THAT IS BUT EARTH AND EVEN THE TOP OF THAT
3723-171631-0021 IS BUT A BUSH GROWING UPON THAT TURF OF EARTH HOW LITTLE OF THE WORLD IS THE EARTH AND YET THAT IS ALL THAT MAN HATH OR IS HOW LITTLE OF A MAN IS THE HEART AND YET IT IS ALL BY WHICH HE IS
3723-171631-0022 IF BEFORE HE HAD A BEING HE COULD HAVE SENSE OF THIS MISERY WOULD BUY A BEING HERE UPON THESE CONDITIONS ELEVEN EXPOSTULATION MY GOD MY GOD
3723-171631-0023 ALL THAT THOU ASKEST OF ME IS MY HEART MY SON GIVE ME THY HEART
3723-171631-0024 AS LONG AS I HAVE BUT MY HEART WILT THOU GIVE ME AN INHERITANCE A FILIATION ANY THING FOR MY HEART
3723-171631-0025 HAST THOU CONSIDERED MY SERVANT JOB THAT THERE IS NONE LIKE HIM UPON THE EARTH
3723-171631-0026 SHALL MY FEAR SHALL MY ZEAL SHALL MY JEALOUSY HAVE LEAVE TO SAY TO THEE HAST THOU CONSIDERED MY HEART THAT THERE IS NOT SO PERVERSE A HEART UPON EARTH
3723-171631-0027 AND WOULDST THOU HAVE THAT AND SHALL I BE THY SON
3723-171631-0028 FOR GIVING THAT THE HEART IS DECEITFUL ABOVE ALL THINGS AND DESPERATELY WICKED WHO CAN KNOW IT
3723-171631-0029 THOU HAST SEARCHED SINCE AND FOUND ALL THESE GRADATIONS IN THE ILL OF OUR HEARTS THAT EVERY IMAGINATION OF THE THOUGHTS OF OUR HEARTS IS ONLY EVIL CONTINUALLY
3723-171631-0030 AND WOULDST THOU HAVE MY HEART O GOD OF ALL LIGHT I KNOW THOU KNOWEST ALL AND IT IS THOU
3723-171631-0031 WITHOUT THEE O SOVEREIGN GOODNESS I COULD NOT KNOW HOW ILL MY HEART WERE THOU HAST DECLARED UNTO ME IN THY WORD THAT FOR ALL THIS DELUGE OF EVIL THAT HATH SURROUNDED ALL HEARTS
3723-171631-0032 YET THOU SOUGHTEST AND FOUNDEST A MAN AFTER THINE OWN HEART
3723-171631-0033 AND I CAN GATHER OUT OF THY WORD SO GOOD TESTIMONY OF THE HEARTS OF MEN AS TO FIND SINGLE HEARTS DOCILE AND APPREHENSIVE HEARTS HEARTS THAT CAN HEARTS THAT HAVE LEARNED
3723-171631-0034 WISE HEARTS IN ONE PLACE AND IN ANOTHER IN A GREAT DEGREE WISE PERFECT HEARTS STRAIGHT HEARTS NO PERVERSENESS WITHOUT AND CLEAN HEARTS NO FOULNESS WITHIN
3723-171631-0035 A HEAVINESS AND DEJECTION OF SPIRIT UPON HIM I HAVE FOUND THESE HEARTS AND A WORSE THAN THESE
3723-171631-0036 THE LAST ARE NOT HEARTS TO BE GIVEN TO THEE WHAT SHALL I DO WITHOUT THAT PRESENT I CANNOT BE THY SON AND I HAVE IT NOT TO THOSE OF THE FIRST KIND THOU GIVEST JOYFULNESS OF HEART
3723-171631-0037 AND I HAVE NOT THAT TO THOSE OF THE OTHER KIND THOU GIVEST FAINTNESS OF HEART
3723-171631-0038 IF YOU RETURN TO THE LORD WITH ALL YOUR HEARTS PREPARE YOUR HEARTS UNTO THE LORD
3723-171631-0039 IT IS A RETURNING HEART AND IF THOU SEE IT UPON THE WAY THOU WILT CARRY IT HOME NAY THE PREPARATION IS THINE TOO THIS MELTING THIS WOUNDING THIS BREAKING
3723-171631-0040 THIS CONTRITION WHICH I HAVE NOW IS THY WAY TO THY END AND THOSE DISCOMFORTS ARE FOR ALL THAT THE EARNEST OF THY SPIRIT IN MY HEART
3723-171631-0041 AND I HAVE HAD SOME DIFFIDENCE UPON THAT AND THOU HAST CLEARED A MORNING TO ME AGAIN AND MY HEART IS ALIVE DAVID'S HEART SMOTE HIM WHEN HE CUT OFF THE SKIRT FROM SAUL
3723-171631-0042 AND HIS HEART SMOTE HIM WHEN HE HAD NUMBERED HIS PEOPLE
3723-171631-0043 WHEN I COME TO NUMBER MY SINS BUT THAT BLOW IS NOT TO DEATH BECAUSE THOSE SINS ARE NOT TO DEATH BUT MY HEART LIVES IN THEE BUT YET AS LONG AS I REMAIN IN THIS GREAT HOSPITAL
3723-171631-0044 THIS SICK THIS DISEASEFUL WORLD AS LONG AS I REMAIN IN THIS LEPROUS HOUSE THIS FLESH OF MINE THIS HEART THOUGH THUS PREPARED FOR THEE PREPARED BY THEE
3723-171631-0045 WILL STILL BE SUBJECT TO THE INVASION OF MALIGN AND PESTILENT VAPOURS BUT I HAVE MY CORDIALS IN THY PROMISE WHEN I SHALL KNOW THE PLAGUE OF MY HEART AND PRAY UNTO THEE IN THY HOUSE
3723-171631-0046 AND THE PEACE OF GOD WHICH PASSETH ALL UNDERSTANDINGS SHALL KEEP MY HEART AND MIND THROUGH CHRIST JESUS
3723-171631-0047 THOUGH THOU FILLEST ALL YET ART OTHERWISE IN SOME ROOMS THEREOF THAN IN OTHERS OTHERWISE IN THY CHURCH THAN IN MY CHAMBER AND OTHERWISE IN THY SACRAMENTS THAN IN MY PRAYERS
3723-171631-0048 SO THOUGH THOU BE ALWAYS PRESENT AND ALWAYS WORKING IN EVERY ROOM OF THIS THY HOUSE MY BODY YET I HUMBLY BESEECH THEE TO MANIFEST ALWAYS A MORE EFFECTUAL PRESENCE IN MY HEART
3723-171631-0049 THAN IN THE OTHER OFFICES INTO THE HOUSE OF THINE ANOINTED DISLOYAL PERSONS TRAITORS WILL COME INTO THY HOUSE THE CHURCH HYPOCRITES AND IDOLATORS WILL COME INTO SOME ROOMS OF THIS THY HOUSE MY BODY
3723-171631-0050 TEMPTATIONS WILL COME INFECTIONS WILL COME BUT BE MY HEART THY BEDCHAMBER O MY GOD AND THITHER LET THEM NOT ENTER JOB MADE A COVENANT WITH HIS EYES BUT NOT HIS MAKING OF THAT COVENANT
3723-171631-0051 BUT THY DWELLING IN HIS HEART ENABLED HIM TO KEEP THAT COVENANT THY SON HIMSELF HAD A SADNESS IN HIS SOUL TO DEATH AND HE HAD A RELUCTATION A DEPRECATION OF DEATH IN THE APPROACHES THEREOF
3723-171631-0052 BUT HE HAD HIS CORDIAL TOO YET NOT MY WILL BUT THINE BE DONE AND AS THOU HAST NOT DELIVERED US THINE ADOPTED SONS FROM THESE INFECTIOUS TEMPTATIONS
3723-171631-0053 SO NEITHER HAST THOU DELIVERED US OVER TO THEM NOR WITHHELD THY CORDIALS FROM US I WAS BAPTIZED IN THY CORDIAL WATER AGAINST ORIGINAL SIN AND I HAVE DRUNK OF THY CORDIAL BLOOD
3723-171631-0054 FOR MY RECOVERY FROM ACTUAL AND HABITUAL SIN IN THE OTHER SACRAMENT THOU O LORD WHO HAST IMPRINTED ALL MEDICINAL VIRTUES WHICH ARE IN ALL CREATURES AND HAST MADE EVEN THE FLESH OF VIPERS TO ASSIST IN CORDIALS
3723-171631-0055 ART ABLE TO MAKE THIS PRESENT SICKNESS EVERLASTING HEALTH THIS WEAKNESS EVERLASTING STRENGTH AND THIS VERY DEJECTION AND FAINTNESS OF HEART A POWERFUL CORDIAL
3723-171631-0056 MY GOD MY GOD WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME THOU DIDST REACH OUT THY HAND TO HIM BUT NOT TO DELIVER HIS SAD SOUL BUT TO RECEIVE HIS HOLY SOUL
3723-171631-0057 NEITHER DID HE LONGER DESIRE TO HOLD IT OF THEE BUT TO RECOMMEND IT TO THEE I SEE THINE HAND UPON ME NOW O LORD AND I ASK NOT WHY IT COMES WHAT IT INTENDS
3723-171631-0058 OR BID IT MEET THEE THIS DAY IN PARADISE I ASK NOT NOT IN A WISH NOT IN A THOUGHT INFIRMITY OF NATURE CURIOSITY OF MIND ARE TEMPTATIONS THAT OFFER
3723-171631-0059 BUT A SILENT AND ABSOLUTE OBEDIENCE TO THY WILL EVEN BEFORE I KNOW IT IS MY CORDIAL PRESERVE THAT TO ME O MY GOD AND THAT WILL PRESERVE ME TO THEE
3723-171631-0060 THAT WHEN THOU HAST CATECHISED ME WITH AFFLICTION HERE I MAY TAKE A GREATER DEGREE AND SERVE THEE IN A HIGHER PLACE IN THY KINGDOM OF JOY AND GLORY
374-180298-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN I MIGHT HAVE TOLD YOU OF THE BEGINNING OF THIS LIAISON IN A FEW LINES BUT I WANTED YOU TO SEE EVERY STEP BY WHICH WE CAME I TO AGREE TO WHATEVER MARGUERITE WISHED
374-180298-0001 MARGUERITE TO BE UNABLE TO LIVE APART FROM ME IT WAS THE DAY AFTER THE EVENING WHEN SHE CAME TO SEE ME THAT I SENT HER MANON LESCAUT FROM THAT TIME SEEING THAT I COULD NOT CHANGE MY MISTRESS'S LIFE I CHANGED MY OWN
374-180298-0002 I WISHED ABOVE ALL NOT TO LEAVE MYSELF TIME TO THINK OVER THE POSITION I HAD ACCEPTED FOR IN SPITE OF MYSELF IT WAS A GREAT DISTRESS TO ME THUS MY LIFE GENERALLY SO CALM
374-180298-0003 ASSUMED ALL AT ONCE AN APPEARANCE OF NOISE AND DISORDER NEVER BELIEVE HOWEVER DISINTERESTED THE LOVE OF A KEPT WOMAN MAY BE THAT IT WILL COST ONE NOTHING
374-180298-0004 NOTHING IS SO EXPENSIVE AS THEIR CAPRICES FLOWERS BOXES AT THE THEATRE SUPPERS DAYS IN THE COUNTRY WHICH ONE CAN NEVER REFUSE TO ONE'S MISTRESS AS I HAVE TOLD YOU I HAD LITTLE MONEY
374-180298-0005 MY FATHER WAS AND STILL IS RECEVEUR GENERAL AT C HE HAS A GREAT REPUTATION THERE FOR LOYALTY THANKS TO WHICH HE WAS ABLE TO FIND THE SECURITY WHICH HE NEEDED IN ORDER TO ATTAIN THIS POSITION
374-180298-0006 I CAME TO PARIS STUDIED LAW WAS CALLED TO THE BAR AND LIKE MANY OTHER YOUNG MEN PUT MY DIPLOMA IN MY POCKET AND LET MYSELF DRIFT AS ONE SO EASILY DOES IN PARIS
374-180298-0007 MY EXPENSES WERE VERY MODERATE ONLY I USED UP MY YEAR'S INCOME IN EIGHT MONTHS AND SPENT THE FOUR SUMMER MONTHS WITH MY FATHER WHICH PRACTICALLY GAVE ME TWELVE THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR AND IN ADDITION THE REPUTATION OF A GOOD SON
374-180298-0008 FOR THE REST NOT A PENNY OF DEBT THIS THEN WAS MY POSITION WHEN I MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MARGUERITE YOU CAN WELL UNDERSTAND THAT IN SPITE OF MYSELF MY EXPENSES SOON INCREASED
374-180298-0009 MARGUERITE'S NATURE WAS VERY CAPRICIOUS AND LIKE SO MANY WOMEN SHE NEVER REGARDED AS A SERIOUS EXPENSE THOSE THOUSAND AND ONE DISTRACTIONS WHICH MADE UP HER LIFE SO WISHING TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME WITH ME AS POSSIBLE
374-180298-0010 SHE WOULD WRITE TO ME IN THE MORNING THAT SHE WOULD DINE WITH ME NOT AT HOME BUT AT SOME RESTAURANT IN PARIS OR IN THE COUNTRY I WOULD CALL FOR HER AND WE WOULD DINE AND GO ON TO THE THEATRE OFTEN HAVING SUPPER AS WELL
374-180298-0011 FORGIVE ME IF I GIVE YOU ALL THESE DETAILS BUT YOU WILL SEE THAT THEY WERE THE CAUSE OF WHAT WAS TO FOLLOW WHAT I TELL YOU IS A TRUE AND SIMPLE STORY AND I LEAVE TO IT ALL THE NAIVETE OF ITS DETAILS
374-180298-0012 AND ALL THE SIMPLICITY OF ITS DEVELOPMENTS I REALIZED THEN THAT AS NOTHING IN THE WORLD WOULD MAKE ME FORGET MY MISTRESS IT WAS NEEDFUL FOR ME TO FIND SOME WAY OF MEETING THE EXPENSES INTO WHICH SHE DREW ME THEN TOO
374-180298-0013 MY LOVE FOR HER HAD SO DISTURBING AN INFLUENCE UPON ME THAT EVERY MOMENT I SPENT AWAY FROM MARGUERITE WAS LIKE A YEAR AND THAT I FELT THE NEED OF CONSUMING THESE MOMENTS IN THE FIRE OF SOME SORT OF PASSION
374-180298-0014 AS NOT TO KNOW THAT I WAS LIVING THEM I BEGAN BY BORROWING FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND FRANCS ON MY LITTLE CAPITAL AND WITH THIS I TOOK TO GAMBLING SINCE GAMBLING HOUSES WERE DESTROYED GAMBLING GOES ON EVERYWHERE
374-180298-0015 FORMERLY WHEN ONE WENT TO FRASCATI ONE HAD THE CHANCE OF MAKING A FORTUNE ONE PLAYED AGAINST MONEY AND IF ONE LOST THERE WAS ALWAYS THE CONSOLATION OF SAYING THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE GAINED WHEREAS NOW EXCEPT IN THE CLUBS
374-180298-0016 WHERE THERE IS STILL A CERTAIN RIGOUR IN REGARD TO PAYMENTS ONE IS ALMOST CERTAIN THE MOMENT ONE GAINS A CONSIDERABLE SUM NOT TO RECEIVE IT YOU WILL READILY UNDERSTAND WHY GAMBLING IS ONLY LIKELY TO BE CARRIED ON BY YOUNG PEOPLE
374-180298-0017 VERY MUCH IN NEED OF MONEY AND NOT POSSESSING THE FORTUNE NECESSARY FOR SUPPORTING THE LIFE THEY LEAD THEY GAMBLE THEN AND WITH THIS RESULT OR ELSE THEY GAIN AND THEN THOSE WHO LOSE SERVE TO PAY FOR THEIR HORSES AND MISTRESSES
374-180298-0018 WHICH IS VERY DISAGREEABLE DEBTS ARE CONTRACTED ACQUAINTANCES BEGUN ABOUT A GREEN TABLE END BY QUARRELS IN WHICH LIFE OR HONOUR COMES TO GRIEF AND THOUGH ONE MAY BE AN HONEST MAN ONE FINDS ONESELF RUINED BY VERY HONEST MEN
374-180298-0019 WHOSE ONLY DEFECT IS THAT THEY HAVE NOT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR I NEED NOT TELL YOU OF THOSE WHO CHEAT AT PLAY
374-180298-0020 I FLUNG MYSELF INTO THIS RAPID NOISY AND VOLCANIC LIFE WHICH HAD FORMERLY TERRIFIED ME WHEN I THOUGHT OF IT AND WHICH HAD BECOME FOR ME THE NECESSARY COMPLEMENT OF MY LOVE FOR MARGUERITE WHAT ELSE COULD I HAVE DONE
374-180298-0021 THE NIGHTS THAT I DID NOT SPEND IN THE RUE D'ANTIN IF I HAD SPENT THEM ALONE IN MY OWN ROOM I COULD NOT HAVE SLEPT JEALOUSY WOULD HAVE KEPT ME AWAKE AND INFLAMED MY BLOOD AND MY THOUGHTS
374-180298-0022 WHILE GAMBLING GAVE A NEW TURN TO THE FEVER WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE PREYED UPON MY HEART AND FIXED IT UPON A PASSION WHICH LAID HOLD ON ME IN SPITE OF MYSELF UNTIL THE HOUR STRUCK WHEN I MIGHT GO TO MY MISTRESS THEN
374-180298-0023 AND BY THIS I KNEW THE VIOLENCE OF MY LOVE I LEFT THE TABLE WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION WHETHER I WAS WINNING OR LOSING PITYING THOSE WHOM I LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT LIKE ME FIND THEIR REAL HAPPINESS IN LEAVING IT
374-180298-0024 FOR THE MOST OF THEM GAMBLING WAS A NECESSITY FOR ME IT WAS A REMEDY FREE OF MARGUERITE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN FREE OF GAMBLING THUS IN THE MIDST OF ALL THAT I PRESERVED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF SELF POSSESSION
374-180298-0025 I LOST ONLY WHAT I WAS ABLE TO PAY AND GAINED ONLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LOSE FOR THE REST CHANCE WAS ON MY SIDE I MADE NO DEBTS AND I SPENT THREE TIMES AS MUCH MONEY AS WHEN I DID NOT GAMBLE
374-180298-0026 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST AN EXISTENCE
374-180298-0027 AS FOR HER SHE CONTINUED TO LOVE ME AS MUCH OR EVEN MORE THAN EVER AS I TOLD YOU I BEGAN BY BEING ALLOWED TO STAY ONLY FROM MIDNIGHT TO SIX O'CLOCK THEN I WAS ASKED SOMETIMES TO A BOX IN THE THEATRE
374-180298-0028 THEN SHE SOMETIMES CAME TO DINE WITH ME ONE MORNING I DID NOT GO TILL EIGHT AND THERE CAME A DAY WHEN I DID NOT GO TILL TWELVE BUT SOONER THAN THE MORAL METAMORPHOSIS A PHYSICAL METAMORPHOSIS CAME ABOUT IN MARGUERITE
374-180298-0029 I HAD TAKEN HER CURE IN HAND AND THE POOR GIRL SEEING MY AIM OBEYED ME IN ORDER TO PROVE HER GRATITUDE I HAD SUCCEEDED WITHOUT EFFORT OR TROUBLE IN ALMOST ISOLATING HER FROM HER FORMER HABITS MY DOCTOR
374-180298-0030 WHOM I HAD MADE HER MEET HAD TOLD ME THAT ONLY REST AND CALM COULD PRESERVE HER HEALTH SO THAT IN PLACE OF SUPPER AND SLEEPLESS NIGHTS I SUCCEEDED IN SUBSTITUTING A HYGIENIC REGIME AND REGULAR SLEEP IN SPITE OF HERSELF
374-180298-0031 MARGUERITE GOT ACCUSTOMED TO THIS NEW EXISTENCE WHOSE SALUTARY EFFECTS SHE ALREADY REALIZED SHE BEGAN TO SPEND SOME OF HER EVENINGS AT HOME OR IF THE WEATHER WAS FINE SHE WRAPPED HERSELF IN A SHAWL PUT ON A VEIL AND WE WENT ON FOOT
374-180298-0032 LIKE TWO CHILDREN IN THE DIM ALLEYS OF THE CHAMPS ELYSEES SHE WOULD COME IN TIRED TAKE A LIGHT SUPPER AND GO TO BED AFTER A LITTLE MUSIC OR READING WHICH SHE HAD NEVER BEEN USED TO DO THE COUGH
374-180298-0033 HAD ALMOST COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED AT THE END OF SIX WEEKS THE COUNT WAS ENTIRELY GIVEN UP AND ONLY THE DUKE OBLIGED ME TO CONCEAL MY LIAISON WITH MARGUERITE AND EVEN HE WAS SENT AWAY WHEN I WAS THERE
374-180298-0034 UNDER THE PRETEXT THAT SHE WAS ASLEEP AND HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT SHE WAS NOT TO BE AWAKENED THE HABIT OR THE NEED OF SEEING ME WHICH MARGUERITE HAD NOW CONTRACTED HAD THIS GOOD RESULT THAT IT FORCED ME TO LEAVE THE GAMING TABLE JUST AT THE MOMENT
374-180298-0035 WHEN AN ADROIT GAMBLER WOULD HAVE LEFT IT SETTLING ONE THING AGAINST ANOTHER I FOUND MYSELF IN POSSESSION OF SOME TEN THOUSAND FRANCS
374-180298-0036 THE TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO JOIN MY FATHER AND SISTER HAD NOW ARRIVED AND I DID NOT GO BOTH OF THEM WROTE TO ME FREQUENTLY BEGGING ME TO COME TO THESE LETTERS I REPLIED AS BEST I COULD
374-180298-0037 ALWAYS REPEATING THAT I WAS QUITE WELL AND THAT I WAS NOT IN NEED OF MONEY TWO THINGS WHICH I THOUGHT WOULD CONSOLE MY FATHER FOR MY DELAY IN PAYING HIM MY ANNUAL VISIT JUST THEN ONE FINE DAY IN SUMMER
374-180298-0038 MARGUERITE WAS AWAKENED BY THE SUNLIGHT POURING INTO HER ROOM AND JUMPING OUT OF BED ASKED ME IF I WOULD TAKE HER INTO THE COUNTRY FOR THE WHOLE DAY
374-180298-0039 WE SENT FOR PRUDENCE AND ALL THREE SET OFF AFTER MARGUERITE HAD GIVEN NANINE ORDERS TO TELL THE DUKE THAT SHE HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE FINE DAY
374-180298-0040 PRUDENCE WAS ONE OF THOSE WOMEN WHO SEEM MADE ON PURPOSE FOR DAYS IN THE COUNTRY WITH HER UNCHANGING GOOD HUMOUR AND HER ETERNAL APPETITE SHE NEVER LEFT A DULL MOMENT TO THOSE WHOM SHE WAS WITH AND WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY IN ORDERING EGGS CHERRIES MILK
374-180298-0041 STEWED RABBIT AND ALL THE REST OF THE TRADITIONAL LUNCH IN THE COUNTRY WE HAD NOW ONLY TO DECIDE WHERE WE SHOULD GO IT WAS ONCE MORE PRUDENCE WHO SETTLED THE DIFFICULTY DO YOU WANT TO GO TO THE REAL COUNTRY SHE ASKED YES
374-180298-0042 ARMAND ORDER AN OPEN CARRIAGE AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER WE WERE AT WIDOW ARNOULD'S PERHAPS YOU KNOW THE INN WHICH IS A HOTEL ON WEEK DAYS AND A TEA GARDEN ON SUNDAYS
374-180298-0043 THERE IS A MAGNIFICENT VIEW FROM THE GARDEN WHICH IS AT THE HEIGHT OF AN ORDINARY FIRST FLOOR ON THE LEFT THE AQUEDUCT OF MARLY CLOSES IN THE HORIZON
374-180298-0044 BEYOND DISTINCT IN THE SUNLIGHT RISE LITTLE WHITE HOUSES WITH RED ROOFS AND MANUFACTORIES WHICH AT THAT DISTANCE PUT AN ADMIRABLE FINISH TO THE LANDSCAPE BEYOND THAT PARIS IN THE MIST
374-180298-0045 AS PRUDENCE HAD TOLD US IT WAS THE REAL COUNTRY AND I MUST ADD IT WAS A REAL LUNCH IT IS NOT ONLY OUT OF GRATITUDE FOR THE HAPPINESS I OWE IT
374-180298-0046 I HAVE TRAVELLED A GOOD DEAL AND SEEN MUCH GRANDER THINGS
374-180298-0047 THE BREEZE THE SHINING SOLITUDE OF FIELDS OR WOODS HOWEVER MUCH ONE LOVES A WOMAN WHATEVER CONFIDENCE ONE MAY HAVE IN HER WHATEVER CERTAINTY HER PAST MAY OFFER US AS TO HER FUTURE ONE IS ALWAYS MORE OR LESS JEALOUS
374-180298-0048 IF YOU HAVE BEEN IN LOVE YOU MUST HAVE FELT THE NEED OF ISOLATING FROM THIS WORLD THE BEING IN WHOM YOU WOULD LIVE WHOLLY IT SEEMS AS IF HOWEVER INDIFFERENT SHE MAY BE TO HER SURROUNDINGS THE WOMAN WHOM ONE LOVES LOSES SOMETHING OF HER PERFUME
374-180298-0049 AND OF HER UNITY AT THE CONTACT OF MEN AND THINGS AS FOR ME I EXPERIENCED THAT MORE THAN MOST MINE WAS NOT AN ORDINARY LOVE I WAS AS MUCH IN LOVE AS AN ORDINARY CREATURE COULD BE
374-180298-0050 AND WHO HAD NO CONCERN WITH US ALONE WITH NATURE IN THE SPRING TIME OF THE YEAR THAT ANNUAL PARDON AND SHUT OFF FROM THE NOISE OF THE CITY I COULD HIDE MY LOVE AND LOVE WITHOUT SHAME OR FEAR
374-180298-0051 THE COURTESAN DISAPPEARED LITTLE BY LITTLE I HAD BY ME A YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WHOM I LOVED AND WHO LOVED ME AND WHO WAS CALLED MARGUERITE THE PAST HAD NO MORE REALITY AND THE FUTURE NO MORE CLOUDS
374-180298-0052 THE SUN SHONE UPON MY MISTRESS AS IT MIGHT HAVE SHONE UPON THE PUREST BRIDE WE WALKED TOGETHER IN THOSE CHARMING SPOTS WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON PURPOSE TO RECALL THE VERSES OF LAMARTINE OR TO SING THE MELODIES OF SCUDO
374-180298-0053 MARGUERITE WAS DRESSED IN WHITE SHE LEANED ON MY ARM SAYING OVER TO ME AGAIN UNDER THE STARRY SKY THE WORDS SHE HAD SAID TO ME THE DAY BEFORE AND FAR OFF THE WORLD WENT ON ITS WAY
374-180298-0054 ADD TO THIS THAT FROM THE PLACE WHERE I WAS I COULD SEE ON THE SHORE A CHARMING LITTLE HOUSE OF TWO STORIES WITH A SEMICIRCULAR RAILING THROUGH THE RAILING IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE A GREEN LAWN SMOOTH AS VELVET
374-180298-0055 AND BEHIND THE HOUSE A LITTLE WOOD FULL OF MYSTERIOUS RETREATS WHERE THE MOSS MUST EFFACE EACH MORNING THE PATHWAY THAT HAD BEEN MADE THE DAY BEFORE CLIMBING FLOWERS CLUNG ABOUT THE DOORWAY OF THIS UNINHABITED HOUSE
374-180298-0056 MOUNTING AS HIGH AS THE FIRST STORY I LOOKED AT THE HOUSE SO LONG THAT I BEGAN BY THINKING OF IT AS MINE SO PERFECTLY DID IT EMBODY THE DREAM THAT I WAS DREAMING I SAW MARGUERITE AND MYSELF THERE
374-180298-0057 BY DAY IN THE LITTLE WOOD THAT COVERED THE HILLSIDE IN THE EVENING SEATED ON THE GRASS AND I ASKED MYSELF IF EARTHLY CREATURES HAD EVER BEEN SO HAPPY AS WE SHOULD BE WHAT A PRETTY HOUSE MARGUERITE SAID TO ME
374-180298-0058 WHERE ASKED PRUDENCE YONDER AND MARGUERITE POINTED TO THE HOUSE IN QUESTION AH DELICIOUS REPLIED PRUDENCE DO YOU LIKE IT VERY MUCH
374-180298-0059 WELL TELL THE DUKE TO TAKE IT FOR YOU HE WOULD DO SO I AM SURE I'LL SEE ABOUT IT IF YOU LIKE MARGUERITE LOOKED AT ME
374-180298-0060 MY DREAM VANISHED AT THE LAST WORDS OF PRUDENCE AND BROUGHT ME BACK TO REALITY SO BRUTALLY THAT I WAS STILL STUNNED WITH THE FALL
374-180298-0061 YES AN EXCELLENT IDEA I STAMMERED NOT KNOWING WHAT I WAS SAYING WELL I WILL ARRANGE THAT SAID MARGUERITE FREEING MY HAND AND INTERPRETING MY WORDS ACCORDING TO HER OWN DESIRE
374-180298-0062 LET US GO AND SEE IF IT IS TO LET THE HOUSE WAS EMPTY AND TO LET FOR TWO THOUSAND FRANCS WOULD YOU BE HAPPY HERE SHE SAID TO ME AM I SURE OF COMING HERE
374-180298-0063 AND FOR WHOM ELSE SHOULD I BURY MYSELF HERE IF NOT FOR YOU WELL THEN MARGUERITE LET ME TAKE IT MYSELF YOU ARE MAD NOT ONLY IS IT UNNECESSARY BUT IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS
374-180298-0064 YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT I HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCEPT IT SAVE FROM ONE MAN LET ME ALONE BIG BABY AND SAY NOTHING THAT MEANS SAID PRUDENCE THAT WHEN I HAVE TWO DAYS FREE I WILL COME AND SPEND THEM WITH YOU
374-180298-0065 WE LEFT THE HOUSE AND STARTED ON OUR RETURN TO PARIS TALKING OVER THE NEW PLAN
374-180299-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN NEXT DAY MARGUERITE SENT ME AWAY VERY EARLY SAYING THAT THE DUKE WAS COMING AT AN EARLY HOUR AND PROMISING TO WRITE TO ME THE MOMENT HE WENT AND TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE EVENING
374-180299-0001 IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY I RECEIVED THIS NOTE
374-180299-0002 BE AT PRUDENCE'S TO NIGHT AT EIGHT
374-180299-0003 WELL IT IS ALL SETTLED SHE SAID AS SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE IS TAKEN ASKED PRUDENCE YES HE AGREED AT ONCE I DID NOT KNOW THE DUKE BUT I FELT ASHAMED OF DECEIVING HIM
374-180299-0004 BUT THAT IS NOT ALL CONTINUED MARGUERITE WHAT ELSE IS THERE I HAVE BEEN SEEING ABOUT A PLACE FOR ARMAND TO STAY IN THE SAME HOUSE ASKED PRUDENCE LAUGHING
374-180299-0005 NO AT POINT DU JOUR WHERE WE HAD DINNER THE DUKE AND I
374-180299-0006 I TOOK IT WAS I RIGHT I FLUNG MY ARMS AROUND HER NECK AND KISSED HER IT WILL BE CHARMING SHE CONTINUED YOU HAVE THE KEY OF THE LITTLE DOOR AND I HAVE PROMISED THE DUKE THE KEY OF THE FRONT DOOR
374-180299-0007 HE HAS ASKED ME HOW I LOVING PARIS AS I DO COULD MAKE UP MY MIND TO BURY MYSELF IN THE COUNTRY I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS ILL AND THAT I WANTED REST HE SEEMED TO HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN BELIEVING ME
374-180299-0008 AND WE SHALL HAVE EVERYTHING PERFECT THE DUKE IS GOING TO LOOK AFTER EVERY SINGLE THING AH MY DEAR SHE ADDED KISSING ME YOU'RE IN LUCK IT'S A MILLIONAIRE WHO MAKES YOUR BED FOR YOU
374-180299-0009 AND WHEN SHALL YOU MOVE INTO THE HOUSE INQUIRED PRUDENCE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WILL YOU TAKE YOUR HORSES AND CARRIAGE I SHALL TAKE THE WHOLE HOUSE AND YOU CAN LOOK AFTER MY PLACE WHILE I AM AWAY
374-180299-0010 A WEEK LATER MARGUERITE WAS SETTLED IN HER COUNTRY HOUSE AND I WAS INSTALLED AT POINT DU JOUR THEN BEGAN AN EXISTENCE WHICH I SHALL HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN DESCRIBING TO YOU
374-180299-0011 PRUDENCE ON HER SIDE BROUGHT DOWN ALL THE PEOPLE SHE KNEW AND DID THE HONOURS OF THE HOUSE AS IF THE HOUSE BELONGED TO HER THE DUKE'S MONEY PAID FOR ALL THAT AS YOU MAY IMAGINE BUT FROM TIME TO TIME PRUDENCE CAME TO ME
374-180299-0012 ASKING FOR A NOTE FOR A THOUSAND FRANCS PROFESSEDLY ON BEHALF OF MARGUERITE YOU KNOW I HAD WON SOME MONEY AT GAMBLING I THEREFORE IMMEDIATELY HANDED OVER TO PRUDENCE WHAT SHE ASKED FOR MARGUERITE
374-180299-0013 AND FEARING LEST SHE SHOULD REQUIRE MORE THAN I POSSESSED I BORROWED AT PARIS A SUM EQUAL TO THAT WHICH I HAD ALREADY BORROWED AND PAID BACK I WAS THEN ONCE MORE IN POSSESSION OF SOME TEN THOUSAND FRANCS WITHOUT RECKONING MY ALLOWANCE
374-180299-0014 HOWEVER MARGUERITE'S PLEASURE IN SEEING HER FRIENDS WAS A LITTLE MODERATED WHEN SHE SAW THE EXPENSE WHICH THAT PLEASURE ENTAILED AND ESPECIALLY THE NECESSITY SHE WAS SOMETIMES IN OF ASKING ME FOR MONEY THE DUKE
374-180299-0015 AND HAVING FALLEN UPON A PARTY OF FIFTEEN WHO WERE STILL AT LUNCH AT AN HOUR WHEN HE WAS PREPARED TO SIT DOWN TO DINNER HE HAD UNSUSPECTINGLY OPENED THE DINING ROOM DOOR AND HAD BEEN GREETED BY A BURST OF LAUGHTER
374-180299-0016 MARGUERITE ROSE FROM TABLE AND JOINED THE DUKE IN THE NEXT ROOM WHERE SHE TRIED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO INDUCE HIM TO FORGET THE INCIDENT BUT THE OLD MAN WOUNDED IN HIS DIGNITY BORE HER A GRUDGE FOR IT
374-180299-0017 AND COULD NOT FORGIVE HER HE SAID TO HER SOMEWHAT CRUELLY THAT HE WAS TIRED OF PAYING FOR THE FOLLIES OF A WOMAN WHO COULD NOT EVEN HAVE HIM TREATED WITH RESPECT UNDER HIS OWN ROOF AND HE WENT AWAY IN GREAT INDIGNATION
374-180299-0018 SINCE THAT DAY HE HAD NEVER BEEN HEARD OF IN VAIN MARGUERITE DISMISSED HER GUESTS CHANGED HER WAY OF LIFE THE DUKE WAS NOT TO BE HEARD OF I WAS THE GAINER IN SO
374-180299-0019 FAR THAT MY MISTRESS NOW BELONGED TO ME MORE COMPLETELY AND MY DREAM WAS AT LENGTH REALIZED MARGUERITE COULD NOT BE WITHOUT ME NOT CARING WHAT THE RESULT MIGHT BE SHE PUBLICLY PROCLAIMED OUR LIAISON
374-180299-0020 AND I HAD COME TO LIVE ENTIRELY AT HER HOUSE THE SERVANTS ADDRESSED ME OFFICIALLY AS THEIR MASTER PRUDENCE HAD STRICTLY SERMONIZED MARGUERITE IN REGARD TO HER NEW MANNER OF LIFE BUT SHE HAD REPLIED THAT SHE LOVED ME THAT SHE COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT ME
374-180299-0021 AND THAT HAPPEN WHAT MIGHT SHE WOULD NOT SACRIFICE THE PLEASURE OF HAVING ME CONSTANTLY WITH HER ADDING THAT THOSE WHO WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS ARRANGEMENT WERE FREE TO STAY AWAY SO MUCH I HAD HEARD ONE DAY WHEN PRUDENCE HAD SAID TO MARGUERITE
374-180299-0022 THAT SHE HAD SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO TELL HER AND I HAD LISTENED AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM INTO WHICH THEY HAD SHUT THEMSELVES NOT LONG AFTER PRUDENCE RETURNED AGAIN I WAS AT THE OTHER END OF THE GARDEN WHEN SHE ARRIVED AND SHE DID NOT SEE ME
374-180299-0023 WELL SAID MARGUERITE WELL I HAVE SEEN THE DUKE WHAT DID HE SAY THAT HE WOULD GLADLY FORGIVE YOU IN REGARD TO THE SCENE WHICH TOOK PLACE
374-180299-0024 AND THAT HE WILL NEVER FORGIVE THAT LET MARGUERITE LEAVE THE YOUNG MAN HE SAID TO ME AND AS IN THE PAST I WILL GIVE HER ALL THAT SHE REQUIRES IF NOT LET HER ASK NOTHING MORE FROM ME
374-180299-0025 AND YOU REPLIED THAT I WOULD REPORT HIS DECISION TO YOU AND I PROMISED HIM THAT I WOULD BRING YOU INTO A MORE REASONABLE FRAME OF MIND ONLY THINK MY DEAR CHILD OF THE POSITION THAT YOU ARE LOSING
374-180299-0026 AND THAT ARMAND CAN NEVER GIVE YOU HE LOVES YOU WITH ALL HIS SOUL BUT HE HAS NO FORTUNE CAPABLE OF SUPPLYING YOUR NEEDS AND HE WILL BE BOUND TO LEAVE YOU ONE DAY WHEN IT WILL BE TOO LATE AND WHEN THE DUKE WILL REFUSE TO DO ANY MORE FOR YOU
374-180299-0027 WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SPEAK TO ARMAND MARGUERITE SEEMED TO BE THINKING FOR SHE ANSWERED NOTHING MY HEART BEAT VIOLENTLY WHILE I WAITED FOR HER REPLY NO SHE ANSWERED I WILL NOT LEAVE ARMAND
374-180299-0028 AND I WILL NOT CONCEAL THE FACT THAT I AM LIVING WITH HIM IT IS FOLLY NO DOUBT BUT I LOVE HIM WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO AND THEN NOW THAT HE HAS GOT ACCUSTOMED TO BE ALWAYS WITH ME
374-180299-0029 I WILL DO WITHOUT IT BUT WHAT WILL YOU DO I DON'T IN THE LEAST KNOW PRUDENCE WAS NO DOUBT GOING TO MAKE SOME REPLY BUT I ENTERED SUDDENLY AND FLUNG MYSELF AT MARGUERITE'S FEET
374-180299-0030 COVERING HER HANDS WITH TEARS IN MY JOY AT BEING THUS LOVED MY LIFE IS YOURS MARGUERITE YOU NEED THIS MAN NO LONGER AM I NOT HERE SHALL I EVER LEAVE YOU AND CAN I EVER REPAY YOU FOR THE HAPPINESS THAT YOU GIVE ME
374-180299-0031 NO MORE BARRIERS MY MARGUERITE WE LOVE WHAT MATTERS ALL THE REST OH YES I LOVE YOU MY ARMAND SHE MURMURED PUTTING HER TWO ARMS AROUND MY NECK I LOVE YOU AS I NEVER THOUGHT I SHOULD EVER LOVE
374-180299-0032 AND I WILL SAY GOOD BYE FOREVER TO THE LIFE FOR WHICH I NOW BLUSH YOU WON'T EVER REPROACH ME FOR THE PAST TELL ME TEARS CHOKED MY VOICE I COULD ONLY REPLY BY CLASPING MARGUERITE TO MY HEART WELL
374-180299-0033 SAID SHE TURNING TO PRUDENCE AND SPEAKING IN A BROKEN VOICE YOU CAN REPORT THIS SCENE TO THE DUKE AND YOU CAN ADD THAT WE HAVE NO LONGER NEED OF HIM FROM THAT DAY FORTH THE DUKE WAS NEVER REFERRED TO
374-180299-0034 MARGUERITE WAS NO LONGER THE SAME WOMAN THAT I HAD KNOWN SHE AVOIDED EVERYTHING THAT MIGHT RECALL TO ME THE LIFE WHICH SHE HAD BEEN LEADING WHEN I FIRST MET HER NEVER DID WIFE OR SISTER SURROUND HUSBAND OR BROTHER WITH SUCH LOVING CARE AS SHE HAD FOR ME
374-180299-0035 ANY ONE WHO HAD SEEN US LEAVING THE HOUSE TO GO ON THE RIVER IN THE CHARMING LITTLE BOAT WHICH I HAD BOUGHT WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED THAT THE WOMAN DRESSED IN WHITE WEARING A STRAW HAT
374-180299-0036 WAS THAT MARGUERITE GAUTIER WHO ONLY FOUR MONTHS AGO HAD BEEN THE TALK OF THE TOWN FOR THE LUXURY AND SCANDAL OF HER EXISTENCE ALAS WE MADE HASTE TO BE HAPPY AS IF WE KNEW THAT WE WERE NOT TO BE HAPPY LONG
374-180299-0037 FOR TWO MONTHS WE HAD NOT EVEN BEEN TO PARIS NO ONE CAME TO SEE US EXCEPT PRUDENCE AND JULIE DUPRAT OF WHOM I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU
374-180299-0038 I PASSED WHOLE DAYS AT THE FEET OF MY MISTRESS WE OPENED THE WINDOWS UPON THE GARDEN AND AS WE WATCHED THE SUMMER RIPENING IN ITS FLOWERS
374-180299-0039 WE BREATHED TOGETHER THAT TRUE LIFE WHICH NEITHER MARGUERITE NOR I HAD EVER KNOWN BEFORE HER DELIGHT IN THE SMALLEST THINGS WAS LIKE THAT OF A CHILD THERE WERE DAYS WHEN SHE RAN IN THE GARDEN LIKE A CHILD OF TEN
374-180299-0040 AFTER A BUTTERFLY OR A DRAGON FLY THIS COURTESAN WHO HAD COST MORE MONEY IN BOUQUETS THAN WOULD HAVE KEPT A WHOLE FAMILY IN COMFORT WOULD SOMETIMES SIT ON THE GRASS FOR AN HOUR EXAMINING THE SIMPLE FLOWER WHOSE NAME SHE BORE
374-180299-0041 IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT SHE READ MANON LESCAUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN I FOUND HER SEVERAL TIMES MAKING NOTES IN THE BOOK AND SHE ALWAYS DECLARED THAT WHEN A WOMAN LOVES SHE CAN NOT DO AS MANON DID
374-180299-0042 THE DUKE WROTE TO HER TWO OR THREE TIMES SHE RECOGNISED THE WRITING AND GAVE ME THE LETTERS WITHOUT READING THEM SOMETIMES THE TERMS OF THESE LETTERS BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES HE HAD IMAGINED THAT BY CLOSING HIS PURSE TO MARGUERITE
374-180299-0043 HE WOULD BRING HER BACK TO HIM BUT WHEN HE HAD PERCEIVED THE USELESSNESS OF THESE MEANS HE COULD HOLD OUT NO LONGER
374-180299-0044 AS BEFORE NO MATTER ON WHAT CONDITIONS I READ THESE URGENT AND REPEATED LETTERS AND TORE THEM IN PIECES WITHOUT TELLING MARGUERITE WHAT THEY CONTAINED AND WITHOUT ADVISING HER TO SEE THE OLD MAN AGAIN
374-180299-0045 THOUGH I WAS HALF INCLINED TO SO MUCH DID I PITY HIM BUT I WAS AFRAID LEST IF I SO ADVISED HER SHE SHOULD THINK THAT I WISHED THE DUKE NOT MERELY TO COME AND SEE HER AGAIN BUT TO TAKE OVER THE EXPENSES OF THE HOUSE
374-180299-0046 I FEARED ABOVE ALL THAT SHE MIGHT THINK ME CAPABLE OF SHIRKING THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF EVERY CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH HER LOVE FOR ME MIGHT LEAD HER IT THUS CAME ABOUT THAT THE DUKE RECEIVING NO REPLY CEASED TO WRITE
3807-4923-0000 MISSUS VICKERS PALE AND SICK WITH TERROR YET SUSTAINED BY THAT STRANGE COURAGE OF WHICH WE HAVE BEFORE SPOKEN PASSED RAPIDLY UNDER THE OPEN SKYLIGHT AND PREPARED TO ASCEND SYLVIA HER ROMANCE CRUSHED BY TOO DREADFUL REALITY
3807-4923-0001 CLUNG TO HER MOTHER WITH ONE HAND AND WITH THE OTHER PRESSED CLOSE TO HER LITTLE BOSOM THE ENGLISH HISTORY IN HER ALL ABSORBING FEAR SHE HAD FORGOTTEN TO LAY IT DOWN
3807-4923-0002 AND SHUDDERING SHOOK HER HEAD THE MEN ABOVE SWORE IMPATIENTLY AT THE DELAY AND THE THREE HASTENED ON DECK WHO'S TO COMMAND THE BRIG NOW ASKED UNDAUNTED BATES AS THEY CAME UP I AM SAYS JOHN REX
3807-4923-0003 AND WITH THESE BRAVE FELLOWS I'LL TAKE HER ROUND THE WORLD THE TOUCH OF BOMBAST WAS NOT OUT OF PLACE IT JUMPED SO FAR WITH THE HUMOUR OF THE CONVICTS THAT THEY SET UP A FEEBLE CHEER AT WHICH SYLVIA FROWNED
3807-4923-0004 FRIGHTENED AS SHE WAS THE PRISON BRED CHILD WAS AS MUCH ASTONISHED AT HEARING CONVICTS CHEER AS A FASHIONABLE LADY WOULD BE TO HEAR HER FOOTMAN QUOTE POETRY BATES HOWEVER PRACTICAL AND CALM TOOK QUITE ANOTHER VIEW OF THE CASE
3807-4923-0005 THE BOLD PROJECT SO BOLDLY AVOWED SEEMED TO HIM A SHEER ABSURDITY THE DANDY AND A CREW OF NINE CONVICTS NAVIGATE A BRIG ROUND THE WORLD PREPOSTEROUS WHY NOT A MAN ABOARD COULD WORK A RECKONING
3807-4923-0006 HIS NAUTICAL FANCY PICTURED THE OSPREY HELPLESSLY ROLLING ON THE SWELL OF THE SOUTHERN OCEAN OR HOPELESSLY LOCKED IN THE ICE OF THE ANTARCTIC SEAS AND HE DIMLY GUESSED AT THE FATE OF THE DELUDED TEN
3807-4923-0007 EVEN IF THEY GOT SAFE TO PORT THE CHANCES OF FINAL ESCAPE WERE ALL AGAINST THEM FOR WHAT ACCOUNT COULD THEY GIVE OF THEMSELVES OVERPOWERED BY THESE REFLECTIONS THE HONEST FELLOW MADE ONE LAST EFFORT TO CHARM HIS CAPTORS BACK TO THEIR PRISTINE BONDAGE
3807-4923-0008 FOOLS HE CRIED DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO DO YOU WILL NEVER ESCAPE GIVE UP THE BRIG AND I WILL DECLARE BEFORE MY GOD UPON THE BIBLE THAT I WILL SAY NOTHING BUT GIVE ALL GOOD CHARACTERS
3807-4923-0009 LESLY AND ANOTHER BURST INTO A LAUGH AT THIS WILD PROPOSITION BUT REX WHO HAD WEIGHED HIS CHANCES WELL BEFOREHAND FELT THE FORCE OF THE PILOT'S SPEECH AND ANSWERED SERIOUSLY IT'S NO USE TALKING HE SAID SHAKING HIS STILL HANDSOME HEAD
3807-4923-0010 WE HAVE GOT THE BRIG AND WE MEAN TO KEEP HER I CAN NAVIGATE HER THOUGH I AM NO SEAMAN SO YOU NEEDN'T TALK FURTHER ABOUT IT MISTER BATES IT'S LIBERTY WE REQUIRE WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH US ASKED BATES LEAVE YOU BEHIND BATES'S FACE BLANCHED
3807-4923-0011 WHAT HERE YES IT DON'T LOOK A PICTURESQUE SPOT DOES IT AND YET I'VE LIVED HERE FOR SOME YEARS AND HE GRINNED BATES WAS SILENT THE LOGIC OF THAT GRIN WAS UNANSWERABLE COME CRIED THE DANDY SHAKING OFF HIS MOMENTARY MELANCHOLY
3807-4923-0012 LOOK ALIVE THERE LOWER AWAY THE JOLLY BOAT MISSUS VICKERS GO DOWN TO YOUR CABIN AND GET ANYTHING YOU WANT
3807-4923-0013 BUT I HAVE NO WISH TO LEAVE YOU WITHOUT CLOTHES BATES LISTENED IN A SORT OF DISMAL ADMIRATION AT THIS COURTLY CONVICT HE COULD NOT HAVE SPOKEN LIKE THAT HAD LIFE DEPENDED ON IT NOW MY LITTLE LADY CONTINUED REX
3807-4923-0014 RUN DOWN WITH YOUR MAMMA AND DON'T BE FRIGHTENED SYLVIA FLASHED BURNING RED AT THIS INDIGNITY FRIGHTENED
3807-4923-0015 FRIGHTENED LET ME PASS PRISONER THE WHOLE DECK BURST INTO A GREAT LAUGH AT THIS AND POOR MISSUS VICKERS PAUSED TREMBLING FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CHILD'S TEMERITY TO THUS TAUNT THE DESPERATE CONVICT WHO HELD THEIR LIVES IN HIS HANDS SEEMED SHEER MADNESS
3807-4923-0016 IN THE BOLDNESS OF THE SPEECH HOWEVER LAY ITS SAFEGUARD REX WHOSE POLITENESS WAS MERE BRAVADO WAS STUNG TO THE QUICK BY THE REFLECTION UPON HIS COURAGE AND THE BITTER ACCENT WITH WHICH THE CHILD HAD PRONOUNCED THE WORD PRISONER
3807-4923-0017 THE GENERIC NAME OF CONVICTS MADE HIM BITE HIS LIPS WITH RAGE HAD HE HAD HIS WILL HE WOULD HAVE STRUCK THE LITTLE CREATURE TO THE DECK BUT THE HOARSE LAUGH OF HIS COMPANIONS WARNED HIM TO FORBEAR THERE IS PUBLIC OPINION EVEN AMONG CONVICTS
3807-4923-0018 AND REX DARED NOT VENT HIS PASSION ON SO HELPLESS AN OBJECT AS MEN DO IN SUCH CASES HE VEILED HIS ANGER BENEATH AN AFFECTATION OF AMUSEMENT IN ORDER TO SHOW THAT HE WAS NOT MOVED BY THE TAUNT HE SMILED UPON THE TAUNTER MORE GRACIOUSLY THAN EVER
3807-4923-0019 YOUR DAUGHTER HAS HER FATHER'S SPIRIT MADAM SAID HE TO MISSUS VICKERS WITH A BOW BATES OPENED HIS MOUTH TO LISTEN HIS EARS WERE NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO TAKE IN THE WORDS OF THIS COMPLIMENTARY CONVICT HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT HE WAS THE VICTIM OF A NIGHTMARE HE ABSOLUTELY FELT
3807-4923-0020 THAT JOHN REX WAS A GREATER MAN AT THAT MOMENT THAN JOHN BATES AS MISSUS VICKERS DESCENDED THE HATCHWAY THE BOAT WITH FRERE AND THE SOLDIERS CAME WITHIN MUSKET RANGE AND LESLY ACCORDING TO ORDERS FIRED HIS MUSKET OVER THEIR HEADS
3807-4923-0021 SHOUTING TO THEM TO LAY TO BUT FRERE BOILING WITH RAGE AT THE MANNER IN WHICH THE TABLES HAD BEEN TURNED ON HIM HAD DETERMINED NOT TO RESIGN HIS LOST AUTHORITY WITHOUT A STRUGGLE DISREGARDING THE SUMMONS HE CAME STRAIGHT ON WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON THE VESSEL
3807-4923-0022 IT WAS NOW NEARLY DARK AND THE FIGURES ON THE DECK WERE INDISTINGUISHABLE THE INDIGNANT LIEUTENANT COULD BUT GUESS AT THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS SUDDENLY FROM OUT OF THE DARKNESS A VOICE HAILED HIM HOLD WATER BACK WATER
3807-4923-0023 IT CRIED AND WAS THEN SEEMINGLY CHOKED IN ITS OWNER'S THROAT THE VOICE WAS THE PROPERTY OF MISTER BATES STANDING NEAR THE SIDE HE HAD OBSERVED REX AND FAIR BRING UP A GREAT PIG OF IRON ERST USED AS PART OF THE BALLAST OF THE BRIG
3807-4923-0024 AND POISE IT ON THE RAIL THEIR INTENTION WAS BUT TOO EVIDENT AND HONEST BATES LIKE A FAITHFUL WATCH DOG BARKED TO WARN HIS MASTER BLOODTHIRSTY CHESHIRE CAUGHT HIM BY THE THROAT AND FRERE UNHEEDING
3807-4923-0025 RAN THE BOAT ALONGSIDE UNDER THE VERY NOSE OF THE REVENGEFUL REX THE MASS OF IRON FELL HALF IN BOARD UPON THE NOW STAYED BOAT AND GAVE HER STERNWAY WITH A SPLINTERED PLANK VILLAINS CRIED FRERE WOULD YOU SWAMP US
3807-4923-0026 AND A DOZEN SUCH AS YE THE BRIG'S OURS CAN'T YE SEE AND WE'RE YOUR MASTERS NOW FRERE STIFLING AN EXCLAMATION OF RAGE CRIED TO THE BOW TO HOOK ON BUT THE BOW HAD DRIVEN THE BOAT BACKWARD AND SHE WAS ALREADY BEYOND ARM'S LENGTH OF THE BRIG
3807-4923-0027 LOOKING UP HE SAW CHESHIRE'S SAVAGE FACE AND HEARD THE CLICK OF THE LOCK AS HE COCKED HIS PIECE THE TWO SOLDIERS EXHAUSTED BY THEIR LONG PULL MADE NO EFFORT TO STAY THE PROGRESS OF THE BOAT
3807-4923-0028 THE DECK OF THE OSPREY HAD BECOME INVISIBLE IN THE DARKNESS FRERE STRUCK HIS FIST UPON THE THWART IN SHEER IMPOTENCE OF RAGE THE SCOUNDRELS HE SAID BETWEEN HIS TEETH THEY'VE MASTERED US WHAT DO THEY MEAN TO DO NEXT
3807-4923-0029 THE ANSWER CAME PAT TO THE QUESTION FROM THE DARK HULL OF THE BRIG BROKE A FLASH AND A REPORT AND A MUSKET BALL CUT THE WATER BESIDE THEM WITH A CHIRPING NOISE BETWEEN THE BLACK INDISTINCT MASS WHICH REPRESENTED THE BRIG
3807-4923-0030 AND THE GLIMMERING WATER WAS VISIBLE A WHITE SPECK WHICH GRADUALLY NEARED THEM COME ALONGSIDE WITH YE HAILED A VOICE OR IT WILL BE THE WORSE FOR YE THEY WANT TO MURDER US SAYS FRERE GIVE WAY MEN
3807-4923-0031 IT'S NO USE MISTER FRERE SAID THE MAN NEAREST HIM WE CAN DO NO GOOD NOW AND THEY WON'T HURT US I DARE SAY YOU DOGS YOU ARE IN LEAGUE WITH THEM BURSTS OUT FRERE PURPLE WITH INDIGNATION DO YOU MUTINY
3807-4923-0032 COME COME SIR RETURNED THE SOLDIER SULKILY THIS AIN'T THE TIME TO BULLY AND AS FOR MUTINY WHY ONE MAN'S ABOUT AS GOOD AS ANOTHER JUST NOW THIS SPEECH FROM THE LIPS OF A MAN WHO
3807-4923-0033 BUT A FEW MINUTES BEFORE WOULD HAVE RISKED HIS LIFE TO OBEY ORDERS OF HIS OFFICER DID MORE THAN AN HOUR'S REASONING TO CONVINCE MAURICE FRERE OF THE HOPELESSNESS OF RESISTANCE HIS AUTHORITY
3807-4923-0034 HE WAS NOW NO MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE INDEED HE WAS LESS THAN MANY FOR THOSE WHO HELD THE FIREARMS WERE THE RULING POWERS WITH A GROAN HE RESIGNED HIMSELF TO HIS FATE AND LOOKING AT THE SLEEVE OF THE UNDRESS UNIFORM HE WORE
3807-4923-0035 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT VIRTUE HAD GONE OUT OF IT WHEN THEY REACHED THE BRIG THEY FOUND THAT THE JOLLY BOAT HAD BEEN LOWERED AND LAID ALONGSIDE IN HER WERE ELEVEN PERSONS BATES WITH FOREHEAD GASHED AND HANDS BOUND THE STUNNED GRIMES
3807-4923-0036 RUSSEN AND FAIR PULLING LYON RILEY CHESHIRE AND LESLY WITH MUSKETS AND JOHN REX IN THE STERN SHEETS
3807-4923-0037 AND A LOADED MUSKET ACROSS HIS KNEES THE WHITE OBJECT WHICH HAD BEEN SEEN BY THE MEN IN THE WHALE BOAT WAS A LARGE WHITE SHAWL WHICH WRAPPED MISSUS VICKERS AND SYLVIA
3807-4923-0038 HE HAD FEARED THAT THE CHILD WAS INJURED BY THE DIRECTION OF REX THE WHALE BOAT WAS BROUGHT ALONGSIDE THE JOLLY BOAT AND CHESHIRE AND LESLY BOARDED HER
3807-4923-0039 FRERE ATTEMPTED TO RESIST THIS INDIGNITY BUT CHESHIRE CLAPPING HIS MUSKET TO HIS EAR SWORE HE WOULD BLOW OUT HIS BRAINS IF HE UTTERED ANOTHER SYLLABLE FRERE CATCHING THE MALIGNANT EYE OF JOHN REX
3807-4923-0040 REMEMBERED HOW EASILY A TWITCH OF THE FINGER WOULD PAY OFF OLD SCORES AND WAS SILENT STEP IN HERE SIR IF YOU PLEASE SAID REX WITH POLITE IRONY I AM SORRY TO BE COMPELLED TO TIE YOU BUT I MUST CONSULT MY OWN SAFETY AS WELL AS YOUR CONVENIENCE
3807-4923-0041 FELL PINIONED AS HE WAS HE COULD NOT RISE WITHOUT ASSISTANCE AND RUSSEN PULLED HIM ROUGHLY TO HIS FEET WITH A COARSE LAUGH IN HIS PRESENT FRAME OF MIND THAT LAUGH GALLED HIM WORSE THAN HIS BONDS
3807-4923-0042 POOR MISSUS VICKERS WITH A WOMAN'S QUICK INSTINCT SAW THIS AND EVEN AMID HER OWN TROUBLE FOUND LEISURE TO CONSOLE HIM THE WRETCHES SHE SAID UNDER HER BREATH AS FRERE WAS FLUNG DOWN BESIDE HER TO SUBJECT YOU TO SUCH INDIGNITY
3807-4923-0043 SYLVIA SAID NOTHING AND SEEMED TO SHRINK FROM THE LIEUTENANT PERHAPS IN HER CHILDISH FANCY SHE HAD PICTURED HIM AS COMING TO HER RESCUE
3807-4923-0044 AND CLAD IN DAZZLING MAIL OR AT THE VERY LEAST AS A MUSCULAR HERO WHO WOULD SETTLE AFFAIRS OUT OF HAND BY SHEER PERSONAL PROWESS IF SHE HAD ENTERTAINED ANY SUCH NOTION THE REALITY MUST HAVE STRUCK COLDLY UPON HER SENSES
3807-4923-0045 MISTER FRERE PURPLE CLUMSY AND BOUND WAS NOT AT ALL HEROIC NOW MY LADS SAYS REX WHO SEEMED TO HAVE ENDURED THE CAST OFF AUTHORITY OF FRERE WE GIVE YOU YOUR CHOICE STAY AT HELL'S GATES OR COME WITH US
3807-4923-0046 THE SOLDIERS PAUSED IRRESOLUTE TO JOIN THE MUTINEERS MEANT A CERTAINTY OF HARD WORK WITH A CHANCE OF ULTIMATE HANGING YET TO STAY WITH THE PRISONERS WAS AS FAR AS THEY COULD SEE TO INCUR THE INEVITABLE FATE OF STARVATION ON A BARREN COAST
3807-4923-0047 DIMLY CAUGHT THE MEANING OF THE SENTENCE
3807-4923-0048 GO WITH HIM YE BEGGARS SAID HE AND LEAVE US HONEST MEN OH YE'LL GET A TYING UP FOR THIS THE PHRASE TYING UP BROUGHT WITH IT RECOLLECTION OF THE WORST PORTION OF MILITARY DISCIPLINE THE CAT
3807-4923-0049 AND REVIVED IN THE MINDS OF THE PAIR ALREADY DISPOSED TO BREAK THE YOKE THAT SAT SO HEAVILY UPON THEM A TRAIN OF DISMAL MEMORIES THE LIFE OF A SOLDIER ON A CONVICT STATION WAS AT THAT TIME A HARD ONE HE WAS OFTEN STINTED IN RATIONS
3807-4923-0050 AND OF NECESSITY DEPRIVED OF ALL RATIONAL RECREATION WHILE PUNISHMENT FOR OFFENCES WAS PROMPT AND SEVERE THE COMPANIES DRAFTED TO THE PENAL SETTLEMENTS WERE NOT COMPOSED OF THE BEST MATERIAL AND THE PAIR HAD GOOD PRECEDENT FOR THE COURSE THEY WERE ABOUT TO TAKE
3807-4923-0051 WHICH IS IT TO BE WE'LL GO WITH YOU SAYS THE MAN WHO HAD PULLED THE STROKE IN THE WHALE BOAT SPITTING INTO THE WATER WITH AVERTED FACE UPON WHICH UTTERANCE THE CONVICTS BURST INTO JOYOUS OATHS AND THE PAIR WERE RECEIVED WITH MUCH HAND SHAKING
3807-4923-0052 THEN REX WITH LYON AND RILEY AS A GUARD GOT INTO THE WHALE BOAT AND HAVING LOOSED THE TWO PRISONERS FROM THEIR BONDS ORDERED THEM TO TAKE THE PLACE OF RUSSEN AND FAIR THE WHALE BOAT WAS MANNED BY THE SEVEN MUTINEERS
3807-4923-0053 REX STEERING FAIR RUSSEN AND THE TWO RECRUITS PULLING AND THE OTHER FOUR STANDING UP WITH THEIR MUSKETS LEVELLED AT THE JOLLY BOAT THEIR LONG SLAVERY HAD BEGOTTEN SUCH A DREAD OF AUTHORITY IN THESE MEN THAT THEY FEARED IT EVEN WHEN IT WAS BOUND AND MENACED BY FOUR MUSKETS
3807-4923-0054 KEEP YOUR DISTANCE SHOUTED CHESHIRE AS FRERE AND BATES IN OBEDIENCE TO ORDERS BEGAN TO PULL THE JOLLY BOAT TOWARDS THE SHORE AND IN THIS FASHION WAS THE DISMAL LITTLE PARTY CONVEYED TO THE MAINLAND IT WAS NIGHT WHEN THEY REACHED IT
3807-4923-0055 BUT THE CLEAR SKY BEGAN TO THRILL WITH A LATE MOON AS YET UNRISEN AND THE WAVES BREAKING GENTLY UPON THE BEACH GLIMMERED WITH A RADIANCE BORN OF THEIR OWN MOTION FRERE AND BATES JUMPING ASHORE HELPED OUT MISSUS VICKERS SYLVIA AND THE WOUNDED GRIMES
3807-4923-0056 THIS BEING DONE UNDER THE MUZZLES OF THE MUSKETS REX COMMANDED THAT BATES AND FRERE SHOULD PUSH THE JOLLY BOAT AS FAR AS THEY COULD FROM THE SHORE AND RILEY CATCHING HER BY A BOAT HOOK AS SHE CAME TOWARDS THEM SHE WAS TAKEN IN TOW
3807-4923-0057 THREE CHEERS FOR OLD ENGLAND AND LIBERTY UPON WHICH A GREAT SHOUT WENT UP ECHOED BY THE GRIM HILLS WHICH HAD WITNESSED SO MANY MISERIES TO THE WRETCHED FIVE THIS EXULTANT MIRTH SOUNDED LIKE A KNELL OF DEATH
3807-4923-0058 GREAT GOD CRIED BATES RUNNING UP TO HIS KNEES IN WATER AFTER THE DEPARTING BOATS WOULD YOU LEAVE US HERE TO STARVE
3807-4955-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE THE FLIGHT GABBETT GUIDED BY THE CROW HAD DETERMINED TO BEACH THE CAPTURED BOAT ON THE SOUTHERN POINT OF CAPE SURVILLE IT WILL BE SEEN BY THOSE WHO HAVE FOLLOWED THE DESCRIPTION OF THE TOPOGRAPHY OF COLONEL ARTHUR'S PENITENTIARY
3807-4955-0001 THAT NOTHING BUT THE DESPERATE NATURE OF THE ATTEMPT COULD HAVE JUSTIFIED SO DESPERATE A MEASURE THE PERPENDICULAR CLIFFS SEEMED TO RENDER SUCH AN ATTEMPT CERTAIN DESTRUCTION BUT VETCH WHO HAD BEEN EMPLOYED IN BUILDING THE PIER AT THE NECK
3807-4955-0002 KNEW THAT ON THE SOUTHERN POINT OF THE PROMONTORY WAS A STRIP OF BEACH UPON WHICH THE COMPANY MIGHT BY GOOD FORTUNE LAND IN SAFETY WITH SOMETHING OF THE DECISION OF HIS LEADER REX THE CROW DETERMINED AT ONCE THAT IN THEIR DESPERATE PLIGHT THIS WAS THE ONLY MEASURE
3807-4955-0003 AND SETTING HIS TEETH AS HE SEIZED THE OAR THAT SERVED AS A RUDDER HE PUT THE BOAT'S HEAD STRAIGHT FOR THE HUGE ROCK THAT FORMED THE NORTHERN HORN OF PIRATES BAY SAVE FOR THE FAINT PHOSPHORESCENT RADIANCE OF THE FOAMING WAVES THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE
3807-4955-0004 AND BURGESS FOR SOME MINUTES PULLED ALMOST AT RANDOM IN PURSUIT THE SAME TREMENDOUS FLASH OF LIGHTNING WHICH HAD SAVED THE LIFE OF MC NAB BY CAUSING REX TO MISS HIS AIM SHOWED TO THE COMMANDANT THE WHALE BOAT BALANCED ON THE SUMMIT OF AN ENORMOUS WAVE
3807-4955-0005 AND APPARENTLY ABOUT TO BE FLUNG AGAINST THE WALL OF ROCK WHICH MAGNIFIED IN THE FLASH SEEMED FRIGHTFULLY NEAR TO THEM THE NEXT INSTANT BURGESS HIMSELF HIS BOAT LIFTED BY THE SWIFTLY ADVANCING BILLOW
3807-4955-0006 SAW A WILD WASTE OF RAGING SEAS SCOOPED INTO ABYSMAL TROUGHS IN WHICH THE BULK OF A LEVIATHAN MIGHT WALLOW AT THE BOTTOM OF ONE OF THESE VALLEYS OF WATER LAY THE MUTINEERS BOAT LOOKING WITH ITS OUTSPREAD OARS LIKE SOME SIX LEGGED INSECT
3807-4955-0007 FLOATING IN A POOL OF INK THE GREAT CLIFF WHOSE EVERY SCAR AND CRAG WAS AS DISTINCT AS THOUGH ITS HUGE BULK WAS BUT A YARD DISTANT SEEMED TO SHOOT OUT FROM ITS BASE TOWARDS THE STRUGGLING INSECT A BROAD FLAT STRAW THAT WAS A STRIP OF DRY LAND
3807-4955-0008 THE NEXT INSTANT THE RUSHING WATER CARRYING THE SIX LEGGED ATOM WITH IT CREAMED UP OVER THIS STRIP OF BEACH
3807-4955-0009 APPEARED TO STOOP DOWN OVER THE OCEAN AND AS IT STOOPED THE BILLOW ROLLED ONWARDS THE BOAT GLIDED DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS AND THE WHOLE PHANTASMAGORIA WAS SWALLOWED UP IN THE TUMULTUOUS DARKNESS OF THE TEMPEST BURGESS HIS HAIR BRISTLING WITH TERROR
3807-4955-0010 SHOUTED TO PUT THE BOAT ABOUT BUT HE MIGHT WITH AS MUCH REASON HAVE SHOUTED AT AN AVALANCHE THE WIND BLEW HIS VOICE AWAY AND EMPTIED IT VIOLENTLY INTO THE AIR A SNARLING BILLOW JERKED THE OAR FROM HIS HAND
3807-4955-0011 DESPITE THE DESPERATE EFFORTS OF THE SOLDIERS THE BOAT WAS WHIRLED UP THE MOUNTAIN OF WATER LIKE A LEAF ON A WATER SPOUT AND A SECOND FLASH OF LIGHTNING SHOWED THEM WHAT SEEMED A GROUP OF DOLLS STRUGGLING IN THE SURF AND A WALNUT SHELL BOTTOM UPWARDS WAS DRIVEN
3807-4955-0012 BY THE RECOIL OF THE WAVES TOWARDS THEM FOR AN INSTANT ALL THOUGHT THAT THEY MUST SHARE THE FATE WHICH HAD OVERTAKEN THE UNLUCKY CONVICTS BUT BURGESS SUCCEEDED IN TRIMMING THE BOAT AND AWED BY THE PERIL HE HAD SO NARROWLY ESCAPED GAVE THE ORDER TO RETURN
3807-4955-0013 AS THE MEN SET THE BOAT'S HEAD TO THE WELCOME LINE OF LIGHTS THAT MARKED THE NECK A BLACK SPOT BALANCED UPON A BLACK LINE WAS SWEPT UNDER THEIR STERN AND CARRIED OUT TO SEA AS IT PASSED THEM THIS BLACK SPOT EMITTED A CRY
3807-4955-0014 AND THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS ONE OF THE SHATTERED BOAT'S CREW CLINGING TO AN OAR HE WAS THE ONLY ONE OF EM ALIVE SAID BURGESS BANDAGING HIS SPRAINED WRIST TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS AT THE NECK AND HE'S FOOD FOR THE FISHES BY THIS TIME HE WAS MISTAKEN HOWEVER
3807-4955-0015 FATE HAD IN RESERVE FOR THE CREW OF VILLAINS A LESS MERCIFUL DEATH THAN THAT OF DROWNING AIDED BY THE LIGHTNING AND THAT WONDERFUL GOOD LUCK WHICH URGES VILLAINY TO ITS DESTRUCTION VETCH BEACHED THE BOAT AND THE PARTY BRUISED AND BLEEDING
3807-4955-0016 REACHED THE UPPER PORTION OF THE SHORE IN SAFETY OF ALL THIS NUMBER ONLY COX WAS LOST HE WAS PULLING STROKE OAR AND BEING SOMETHING OF A LAGGARD STOOD IN THE WAY OF THE CROW WHO SEEING THE IMPORTANCE OF HASTE IN PRESERVING HIS OWN SKIN PLUCKED THE MAN BACKWARDS BY THE COLLAR
3807-4955-0017 AND PASSED OVER HIS SPRAWLING BODY TO THE SHORE COX GRASPING AT ANYTHING TO SAVE HIMSELF CLUTCHED AN OAR AND THE NEXT MOMENT FOUND HIMSELF BORNE OUT WITH THE OVERTURNED WHALE BOAT BY THE UNDER TOW HE WAS DRIFTED PAST HIS ONLY HOPE OF RESCUE THE GUARD BOAT
3807-4955-0018 WITH A VELOCITY THAT FORBADE ALL ATTEMPTS AT RESCUE AND ALMOST BEFORE THE POOR SCOUNDREL HAD TIME TO REALIZE HIS CONDITION HE WAS IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY OF ESCAPING THE HANGING THAT HIS COMRADES HAD SO OFTEN HUMOROUSLY PROPHESIED FOR HIM
3807-4955-0019 BEING A STRONG AND VIGOROUS VILLAIN HOWEVER HE CLUNG TENACIOUSLY TO HIS OAR AND EVEN UNBUCKLING HIS LEATHER BELT PASSED IT ROUND THE SLIP OF WOOD THAT WAS HIS SALVATION GIRDING HIMSELF TO IT AS FIRMLY AS HE WAS ABLE
3807-4955-0020 IN THIS CONDITION PLUS A SWOON FROM EXHAUSTION HE WAS DESCRIED BY THE HELMSMAN OF THE PRETTY MARY A FEW MILES FROM CAPE SURVILLE AT DAYLIGHT NEXT MORNING
3807-4955-0021 LOWERED A BOAT AND PICKED HIM UP NEARLY BISECTED BY THE BELT GORGED WITH SALT WATER FROZEN WITH COLD AND HAVING TWO RIBS BROKEN THE VICTIM OF VETCH'S MURDEROUS QUICKNESS RETAINED SUFFICIENT LIFE TO SURVIVE BLUNT'S REMEDIES FOR NEARLY TWO HOURS
3807-4955-0022 DURING THAT TIME HE STATED THAT HIS NAME WAS COX THAT HE HAD ESCAPED FROM PORT ARTHUR WITH EIGHT OTHERS THAT JOHN REX WAS THE LEADER OF THE EXPEDITION THAT THE OTHERS WERE ALL DROWNED AND THAT HE BELIEVED JOHN REX HAD BEEN RETAKEN HAVING PLACED BLUNT IN POSSESSION OF THESE PARTICULARS
3807-4955-0023 HE FURTHER SAID THAT IT PRICKED HIM TO BREATHE CURSED JEMMY VETCH THE SETTLEMENT AND THE SEA AND SO IMPENITENTLY DIED BLUNT SMOKED THREE PIPES AND THEN ALTERED THE COURSE OF THE PRETTY MARY TWO POINTS TO THE EASTWARD AND RAN FOR THE COAST
3807-4955-0024 IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT THE MAN FOR WHOM HE WAS SEARCHING HAD NOT BEEN RETAKEN AND WAS EVEN NOW AWAITING HIS ARRIVAL IT WAS CLEARLY HIS DUTY HEARING OF THE PLANNED ESCAPE HAVING BEEN ACTUALLY ATTEMPTED NOT TO GIVE UP THE EXPEDITION WHILE HOPE REMAINED
3807-4955-0025 THE PRETTY MARY HUGGING THE COAST AS CLOSELY AS SHE DARED CRAWLED IN THE THIN BREEZE ALL DAY AND SAW NOTHING IT WOULD BE MADNESS TO LAND AT CAPE SURVILLE FOR THE WHOLE STATION WOULD BE ON THE ALERT SO BLUNT AS NIGHT WAS FALLING
3807-4955-0026 STOOD OFF A LITTLE ACROSS THE MOUTH OF PIRATES BAY HE WAS WALKING THE DECK GROANING AT THE FOLLY OF THE EXPEDITION WHEN A STRANGE APPEARANCE ON THE SOUTHERN HORN OF THE BAY MADE HIM COME TO A SUDDEN HALT THERE WAS A FURNACE BLAZING IN THE BOWELS OF THE MOUNTAIN
3807-4955-0027 BLUNT RUBBED HIS EYES AND STARED HE LOOKED AT THE MAN AT THE HELM DO YOU SEE ANYTHING YONDER JEM JEM A SYDNEY MAN WHO HAD NEVER BEEN ROUND THAT COAST BEFORE BRIEFLY REMARKED LIGHTHOUSE
3807-4955-0028 BLUNT STUMPED INTO THE CABIN AND GOT OUT HIS CHARTS NO LIGHTHOUSE WAS LAID DOWN THERE ONLY A MARK LIKE AN ANCHOR AND A NOTE REMARKABLE HOLE AT THIS POINT A REMARKABLE HOLE INDEED
3807-4955-0029 A REMARKABLE LIME KILN WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO THE PURPOSE BLUNT CALLED UP HIS MATE WILLIAM STAPLES A FELLOW WHOM SARAH PURFOY'S GOLD HAD BOUGHT BODY AND SOUL WILLIAM STAPLES LOOKED AT THE WAXING AND WANING GLOW FOR A WHILE
3807-4955-0030 AND THEN SAID IN TONES TREMBLING WITH GREED IT'S A FIRE LIE TO AND LOWER AWAY THE JOLLY BOAT OLD MAN THAT'S OUR BIRD FOR A THOUSAND POUNDS THE PRETTY MARY SHORTENED SAIL AND BLUNT AND STAPLES GOT INTO THE JOLLY BOAT
3807-4955-0031 GOIN A HOYSTERIN SIR SAID ONE OF THE CREW WITH A GRIN AS BLUNT THREW A BUNDLE INTO THE STERN SHEETS STAPLES THRUST HIS TONGUE INTO HIS CHEEK THE OBJECT OF THE VOYAGE WAS NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD AMONG THE CAREFULLY PICKED CREW
3807-4955-0032 BLUNT HAD NOT CHOSEN MEN WHO WERE LIKELY TO BETRAY HIM THOUGH FOR THAT MATTER REX HAD SUGGESTED A PRECAUTION WHICH RENDERED BETRAYAL ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
3807-4955-0033 CLOTHES RETURNED BLUNT WE CAN'T BRING HIM OFF IF IT IS HIM IN HIS CANARIES HE PUTS ON THESE DUDS D'YE SEE SINKS HER MAJESTY'S LIVERY AND COMES ABOARD A SHIPWRECKED MARINER THAT'S WELL THOUGHT OF WHOSE NOTION'S THAT
3807-4955-0034 THE MADAM'S I'LL BE BOUND AY SHE'S A KNOWING ONE AND THE SINISTER LAUGHTER OF THE PAIR FLOATED ACROSS THE VIOLET WATER GO EASY MAN SAID BLUNT AS THEY NEARED THE SHORE THEY'RE ALL AWAKE AT EAGLEHAWK AND IF THOSE CURSED DOGS GIVE TONGUE
3807-4955-0035 THERE'LL BE A BOAT OUT IN A TWINKLING IT'S LUCKY THE WIND'S OFF SHORE STAPLES LAY ON HIS OAR AND LISTENED THE NIGHT WAS MOONLESS AND THE SHIP HAD ALREADY DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW THEY WERE APPROACHING THE PROMONTORY FROM THE SOUTH EAST
3807-4955-0036 AND THIS ISTHMUS OF THE GUARDED NECK WAS HIDDEN BY THE OUTLYING CLIFF IN THE SOUTH WESTERN ANGLE OF THIS CLIFF ABOUT MIDWAY BETWEEN THE SUMMIT AND THE SEA WAS AN ARCH WHICH VOMITED A RED AND FLICKERING LIGHT THAT FAINTLY SHONE UPON THE SEA IN THE TRACK OF THE BOAT
3807-4955-0037 THE LIGHT WAS LAMBENT AND UNCERTAIN NOW SINKING ALMOST INTO INSIGNIFICANCE AND NOW LEAPING UP WITH A FIERCENESS THAT CAUSED A DEEP GLOW TO THROB IN THE VERY HEART OF THE MOUNTAIN SOMETIMES A BLACK FIGURE WOULD PASS ACROSS THIS GIGANTIC FURNACE MOUTH
3807-4955-0038 STOOPING AND RISING AS THOUGH FEEDING THE FIRE ONE MIGHT HAVE IMAGINED THAT A DOOR IN VULCAN'S SMITHY
3807-4955-0039 AND THAT THE OLD HERO WAS FORGING ARMS FOR A DEMIGOD BLUNT TURNED PALE IT'S NO MORTAL HE WHISPERED LET'S GO BACK AND WHAT WILL MADAM SAY RETURNED DARE DEVIL WILL STAPLES WHO WOULD HAVE PLUNGED INTO MOUNT EREBUS HAD HE BEEN PAID FOR IT
3830-12529-0000 A BEAUTIFUL PEBBLY BEACH EXTENDED ALMOST TO THE WATER'S EDGE EVEN AT LOW TIDE THERE WAS A GRASSY LEVEL SPIT A BACKGROUND OF EVERGREEN GIANT FIR TIMBER
3830-12529-0001 AND SUCH FUEL FOR THE CAMP FIRE BROKEN LIMBS WITH JUST ENOUGH PITCH TO MAKE A CHEERFUL BLAZE AND YET BODY ENOUGH TO LAST WELL
3830-12529-0002 GLAD THE JOURNEY HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED OLIVER WAS THE CARPENTER OF THE PARTY THE TENT BUILDER WOOD GETTER AND GENERAL ROUSTABOUT WHILE I THE JUNIOR WAS CHIEF COOK AND BOTTLE WASHER
3830-12529-0003 AN ENCAMPMENT OF INDIANS BEING NEAR A PARTY OF THEM SOON VISITED OUR CAMP AND BEGAN MAKING SIGNS FOR TRADE
3830-12529-0004 SAID ONE OF THE MATRONS OF THE PARTY WHAT DOES SHE SAY OLIVER I'M BLESSED IF I KNOW BUT IT LOOKS AS IF SHE WANTED TO SELL SOME CLAMS AFTER CONSIDERABLE DICKERING WITH SIGNS AND GESTURES AND WORDS MANY TIMES REPEATED
3830-12529-0005 WE WERE ABLE TO IMPART THE INFORMATION THAT WE WANTED
3830-12530-0000 SOON WE CAME IN SIGHT OF A FLEET OF SEVEN VESSELS LYING AT ANCHOR IN A LARGE BAY SEVERAL MILES IN EXTENT THE SIGHT OF THOSE SEVEN VESSELS LYING IN THE OFFING MADE A PROFOUND IMPRESSION UPON OUR MINDS
3830-12530-0001 WE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SO MANY SHIPS AT ONE PLACE CURIOUSLY ENOUGH AMONG THEM WAS THE GOOD BARK MARY MELVILLE WITH HER GRUFF MATE AND BIG HEARTED MASTER CAPTAIN BARSTON
3830-12530-0002 UPON THE EASTERN SLOPE OF THE SHORES OF THIS BAY LAY THE TWO TOWNS PORT STEILACOOM AND STEILACOOM CITY BOTH ESTABLISHED IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE A FAR LARGER TRADE CENTERED HERE THAN AT ANY OTHER POINT ON PUGET SOUND
3830-12530-0003 AND WE DECIDED ON A HALT TO MAKE OURSELVES ACQUAINTED WITH THE SURROUNDINGS A MILE AND A HALF FROM THE SHORE WE FOUND ALSO FORT STEILACOOM IT WAS SIMPLY THE CAMP OF A COMPANY OF UNITED STATES SOLDIERS QUARTERED IN WOODEN SHELLS OF HOUSES
3830-12530-0004 AND LOG CABINS INTENSE RIVALRY RAN BETWEEN THE TWO TOWNS UPPER AND LOWER STEILACOOM AT THIS TIME AS A RESULT THINGS WERE BOOMING
3830-12530-0005 WE WERE SORELY TEMPTED TO ACCEPT THE FLATTERING OFFER OF FOUR DOLLARS A DAY FOR COMMON LABOR IN A TIMBER CAMP BUT CONCLUDED NOT TO BE SWERVED FROM THE SEARCH FOR A NEW HOMESITE DURING THIS VISIT WE BEGAN SEEING INDIANS IN CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS
3830-12530-0006 THEY SEEMED TO BE A LISTLESS LOT WITH NO THOUGHT FOR THE FUTURE OR EVEN FOR THE IMMEDIATE PRESENT THE INDIANS IN THOSE DAYS SEEMED TO WORK OR PLAY BY SPURTS AND SPELLS HERE AND THERE WE SAW A FAMILY
3830-12530-0007 BUT AS A CLASS THEY SEEMED TO ME THE LAZIEST SET OF PEOPLE ON EARTH THAT OPINION WAS MATERIALLY MODIFIED LATER AS I BECAME BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR HABITS I HAVE FOUND JUST AS INDUSTRIOUS PEOPLE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN
3830-12530-0008 AMONG THE INDIANS AS AMONG THE WHITES THE WORKERS IT MAY BE SAID ARE LESS NUMEROUS AMONG THE MEN THE WOMEN ARE ALL INDUSTRIOUS SHOULD WE CAMP HERE AND SPY OUT THE LAND OR SHOULD WE GO FORWARD AND SEE WHAT LAY BEFORE US
3830-12530-0009 AFTER A SOBER SECOND THOUGHT WE REALIZED THAT WE HAD NOTHING TO TRADE BUT LABOR AND WE HAD NOT COME AS FAR AS THIS TO BE LABORERS FOR HIRE WE HAD COME TO FIND A PLACE TO MAKE A FARM
3830-12530-0010 AND A FARM WE WERE GOING TO HAVE AGAIN WE SET ABOUT SEARCHING FOR CLAIMS AND THE MORE WE SEARCHED THE LESS WE LIKED THE LOOK OF THINGS FINALLY ON THE FOURTH DAY AFTER A LONG WEARISOME TRAMP WE CAST OFF AT HIGH TIDE
3830-12530-0011 AND IN A DEAD CALM TO CONTINUE OUR CRUISE OLIVER SOON DROPPED INTO A COMFORTABLE AFTERNOON NAP LEAVING ME IN FULL COMMAND AS THE SUN SHONE WARM AND THE TIDE WAS TAKING US RAPIDLY IN THE DIRECTION WE WANTED TO GO
3830-12530-0012 WHY SHOULDN'T I DOZE A LITTLE TOO EVEN IF WE DID MISS SOME OF THE SIGHTSEEING I WAS AROUSED FROM MY NAP BY OLIVER'S EXCLAIMING WHAT IS THAT THEN HALF TO HIMSELF AS I LIVE IT'S A DEER SWIMMING OUT HERE IN THE BAY
3830-12530-0013 IT SURELY CAN'T BE I RESPONDED THREE QUARTERS ASLEEP THAT'S WHAT IT IS HE ASSERTED WE WERE WIDE AWAKE NOW AND GAVE CHASE VERY SOON WE CAUGHT UP WITH THE ANIMAL AND SUCCEEDED IN THROWING A ROPE OVER ITS HORNS
3830-12530-0014 BY THIS TIME WE HAD DRIFTED INTO THE NARROWS AND WE SOON FOUND WE HAD SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT TO DO THAN TO TOW A DEER
3830-12530-0015 A PERPENDICULAR BLUFF ROSE FROM THE HIGHWATER MARK LEAVING NO PLACE FOR CAMP FIRE OR BED
3830-12530-0016 AND WITH CONTENDING FORCES OF CURRENTS AND COUNTER CURRENTS YET ALL MOVING IN A GENERAL DIRECTION IT WAS OUR FIRST INTRODUCTION TO A GENUINE TIDE RIP THE WATERS BOILED AS IF IN A VERITABLE CALDRON SWELLING UP HERE AND THERE
3830-12530-0017 GIVE ME THE SALMON CAUGHT BY TROLLING IN EARLY SUMMER IN THE DEEP WATERS OF PUGET SOUND THE FISH SO FAT THAT THE EXCESS OF OIL MUST BE TURNED OUT OF THE PAN WHILE COOKING
3830-12530-0018 THE FOLLOWING DAY WE COULD SEE MT RAINIER WITH ITS REFLECTION IN THE PLACID WATERS OF THE BAY THEODORE WINTHROP THE OBSERVANT TRAVELER WHO CAME INTO THESE SAME WATERS A FEW MONTHS LATER AND WROTE OF IT AS MT TACOMA
3830-12530-0019 DESCRIBED IT AS A GIANT MOUNTAIN DOME OF SNOW SEEMING TO FILL THE AERIAL SPACES AS THE IMAGE DISPLACED THE BLUE DEEPS OF TRANQUIL WATER A WONDROUS SIGHT IT WAS AND IS WHATEVER THE NAME NEXT DAY WE ENTERED THE MOUTH OF THE PUYALLUP
3830-12530-0020 AND THAT THE CURRENT WAS VERY STRONG WE SECURED THE SERVICES OF AN INDIAN AND HIS CANOE TO HELP US UP THE RIVER AND LEFT OUR BOAT AT THE INDIANS CAMP NEAR THE MOUTH IT TOOK A TUGGING OF TWO DAYS TO GO SIX MILES
3830-12530-0021 AND DRAG OUR CANOE AROUND THE DRIFTS IT WAS A STORY OF CONSTANT TOIL WITH CONSEQUENT DISCOURAGEMENT NOT ENDING UNTIL WE CAMPED
3830-12530-0022 AN INDIAN TRAIL LED UP THE RIVER FROM
3830-12530-0023 BUT WAGON ROADS THERE WERE NONE AND WHETHER A FEASIBLE ROUTE FOR ONE COULD BE FOUND ONLY TIME AND LABOR COULD DETERMINE WE RETRACED OUR STEPS AND IN THE EVENING LANDED AGAIN AT THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER AFTER A SEVERE DAY'S TOIL WE WERE IN NO CHEERFUL MOOD
3830-12530-0024 OLIVER DID NOT SING AS USUAL WHILE PREPARING FOR CAMP NEITHER DID I HAVE MUCH TO SAY BUT I FELL TO WORK MECHANICALLY PREPARING THE MUCH NEEDED MEAL WE ATE IN SILENCE AND THEN WENT TO SLEEP
3830-12530-0025 OVER HUNDREDS OF MILES OF UNOCCUPIED PRAIRIE LAND AS RICH AS ANYTHING THAT EVER LAY OUT OF DOORS ON OUR WAY FROM INDIANA TO OREGON IN SEARCH OF LAND ON WHICH TO MAKE A HOME HERE AT WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE END OF OUR ROPE
3830-12530-0026 WE HAD FOUND THE LAND BUT WITH CONDITIONS THAT SEEMED ALMOST TOO ADVERSE TO OVERCOME IT WAS A DISCOURAGING OUTLOOK EVEN IF THERE HAD BEEN ROADS SUCH TIMBER IT SEEMED AN APPALLING UNDERTAKING TO CLEAR THIS LAND
3830-12530-0027 WHEN WE FELL ASLEEP THAT NIGHT IT WAS WITHOUT VISIONS OF NEW FOUND WEALTH AND YET LATER I DID TACKLE A QUARTER SECTION OF THAT HEAVIEST TIMBER LAND AND NEVER LET UP UNTIL THE LAST TREE LOG STUMP AND ROOT HAD DISAPPEARED
3830-12530-0028 THOUGH OF COURSE NOT ALL CLEARED OFF BY MY OWN HANDS IF WE COULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT WAS COMING FOUR MONTHS LATER WE WOULD HAVE REMAINED IN SPITE OF OUR DISCOURAGEMENT
3830-12530-0029 PASS TRAIL INTO WASHINGTON THEY LOCATED IN A BODY OVER NEARLY THE WHOLE VALLEY AND BEFORE THE YEAR WAS ENDED HAD MADE A ROUGH WAGON ROAD OUT TO THE PRAIRIES
3830-12530-0030 LEST SOME SMART FELLOW SHOULD UP AND SAY I WAS DRAWING ON MY IMAGINATION I AM NOT WHEN WE HAD BROKEN CAMP AND WERE SAILING ALONG WE HEARD A DULL SOUND LIKE THAT OFTEN HEARD
3830-12530-0031 IT EXTENDED AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE IN THE DIRECTION WE WERE GOING THE SOUND INCREASED AND BECAME LIKE THE ROAR OF A HEAVY FALL OF RAIN OR HAIL ON WATER AND WE BECAME AWARE THAT IT WAS A VAST SCHOOL OF FISH MOVING SOUTH
3830-12530-0032 WHILE MILLIONS WERE SEEMINGLY DANCING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER OR LEAPING IN THE AIR WE COULD FEEL THE FISH STRIKING AGAINST THE BOAT IN SUCH VAST NUMBERS THAT THEY FAIRLY MOVED IT THE LEAP IN THE AIR WAS SO HIGH
3830-12530-0033 ONE WOULD DROP INTO THE BOAT WE SOON DISCOVERED SOME INDIANS FOLLOWING THE SCHOOL
3830-12530-0034 WITH AN IMPROVISED NET WE TOO SOON OBTAINED ALL WE WANTED WHEN WE BEGAN TO GO ON WE WERE EMBARRASSED BY THE MASS OF FISH MOVING IN THE WATER AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE THERE WAS NO END TO THE SCHOOL AHEAD OF US BUT WE FINALLY GOT CLEAR OF THE MOVING MASS
3830-12530-0035 AND REACHED THE ISLAND SHORE IN SAFETY ONLY TO BECOME WEATHER BOUND IN THE WILDS ONCE MORE THIS CAMP DID NOT PROVE SO DREARY AS THE LAST ONE ALTHOUGH IT WAS MORE EXPOSED TO THE SWELL OF THE BIG WATERS
3830-12530-0036 AND THE SWEEP OF THE WIND TO THE NORTH WE HAD A VIEW OF THIRTY MILES OR MORE TO WHERE HORIZON AND WATER BLENDED LEAVING IT DOUBTFUL WHETHER LAND WAS IN SIGHT OR NOT AS WE AFTERWARDS ASCERTAINED WE COULD SEE THE FAMOUS SAN JUAN ISLAND
3830-12530-0037 LATER THE BONE OF CONTENTION BETWEEN OUR GOVERNMENT AND GREAT BRITAIN WHEN THE NORTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE UNITED STATES WAS SETTLED PORT TOWNSEND LAY
3830-12530-0038 THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE TOWN LIKE THE LOST HUNTERS WE KNEW WHERE WE WERE BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE ANY PLACE ELSE WAS NOT LOST OURSELVES THE WORLD WAS LOST FROM US THREE SHIPS PASSED US WHILE WE WERE AT THIS CAMP
3830-12530-0039 A MERE SPECK AND GROWING TO A FULL FLEDGED DEEP SEA VESSEL WITH ALL SAILS SET SCUDDING BEFORE THE WIND THE OTHER TWO WERE GRACEFULLY BEATING THEIR WAY OUT
3830-12530-0040 WITH THE BEAUTIFUL OPEN AND COMPARATIVELY LEVEL PLATEAU IN THE BACKGROUND AND TWO OR THREE VESSELS AT ANCHOR IN THE FOREGROUND MADE A PICTURE OF A PERFECT CITY SITE
3830-12530-0041 MANY SHACKS AND CAMPS AT FIRST MISTAKEN FOR THE WHITE MEN'S HOUSES WERE FOUND TO BE OCCUPIED BY NATIVES THEY WERE A DRUNKEN RASCALLY RABBLE SPENDING THEIR GAINS FROM THE SALE OF FISH AND OIL
3830-12530-0042 IN A DEBAUCH THAT WOULD LAST AS LONG AS THEIR MONEY HELD OUT THIS SEEMED TO BE A MORE STALWART RACE OF INDIANS THAN THOSE TO THE SOUTH DOUBTLESS FROM THE BUFFETING RECEIVED IN THE LARGER WATERS THEY WOULD OFTEN GO OUT EVEN TO THE OPEN SEA
3830-12530-0043 ON THEIR FISHING EXCURSIONS IN CANOES MANNED BY THIRTY MEN OR MORE AFTER SPENDING TWO OR THREE DAYS EXPLORING THE COUNTRY WE TURNED BACK TO THE BAY WHERE LAY THE SEVEN SHIPS WE HAD SEEN NEAR STEILACOOM WE REMEMBERED THE TIMBER CAMPS
3830-12530-0044 THE BUSTLE AND STIR OF THE LITTLE NEW VILLAGE AND THE ACTIVITY THAT WE SAW THERE GREATER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE WATERS OF THE SOUND MOST OF ALL MY THOUGHTS WOULD GO ON TO THE LITTLE CABIN ON THE COLUMBIA RIVER THREE DAYS SUFFICED TO LAND
3830-12530-0045 US BACK IN THE BAY WE SOUGHT BUT THE SHIPS WERE GONE NOT A SAILING CRAFT OF ANY KIND WAS IN SIGHT OF THE LITTLE TOWN
3830-12531-0000 CAN I GET HOME TONIGHT I ASKED MYSELF IT WAS AN AFTERNOON OF THE LAST WEEK OF JUNE IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE AND THE SUN WAS YET HIGH I WAS WELL UP THE LEFT BANK OF THE COWLITZ RIVER HOW FAR I COULD NOT TELL
3830-12531-0001 FOR THERE WERE NO MILESTONES ON THE CROOKED HALF OBSTRUCTED TRAIL LEADING DOWNSTREAM AT BEST IT WOULD BE A RACE WITH THE SUN BUT THE DAYS WERE LONG AND THE TWILIGHT WAS LONG
3830-12531-0002 I WORE A HEAVY WOOLEN SHIRT A SLOUCH HAT AND WORN SHOES BOTH HAT AND SHOES GAVE AMPLE VENTILATION SOCKS I HAD NONE NEITHER HAD I SUSPENDERS AN IMPROVISED BELT
3830-12531-0003 TAKING THEIR PLACE I WAS DRESSED FOR THE RACE AND WAS EAGER FOR THE TRIAL AT OLYMPIA I HAD PARTED WITH MY BROTHER
3830-12531-0004 WHILE I WAS TO GO HOME FOR THE WIFE AND BABY TO REMOVE THEM TO OUR NEW HOME I DID NOT PARTICULARLY MIND THE CAMPING BUT I DID NOT FANCY THE IDEA OF LYING OUT SO NEAR HOME IF BY EXTRA EXERTION I COULD REACH THE CABIN BEFORE NIGHT
3830-12531-0005 WE NEVER THOUGHT OF CATCHING COLD FROM LYING ON THE GROUND OR ON CEDAR BOUGHS OR FROM GETTING A GOOD DRENCHING AFTER ALL THE CABIN COULD NOT BE REACHED AS THE TRAIL COULD NOT BE FOLLOWED AT NIGHT
3830-12531-0006 SLACKENING PACE AT NIGHTFALL TO COOL MY SYSTEM GRADUALLY I FINALLY MADE MY CAMP AND SLEPT AS SOUNDLY AS IF ON A BED OF DOWN MY CONSOLATION WAS THAT THE NIGHT WAS SHORT AND I COULD SEE TO TRAVEL BY THREE O'CLOCK
3830-12531-0007 I DO NOT LOOK UPON THOSE YEARS OF CAMP AND CABIN LIFE AS YEARS OF HARDSHIP TO BE SURE OUR FOOD WAS PLAIN AS WELL AS OUR DRESS OUR HOURS OF LABOR WERE LONG AND THE LABOR ITSELF WAS FREQUENTLY SEVERE THE PIONEERS APPEARED ROUGH AND UNCOUTH
3830-12531-0008 WE NEVER WATCHED FOR THE SUN TO GO DOWN
3830-12531-0009 OR FOR THE BOSS TO QUICKEN OUR STEPS THE DAYS WERE ALWAYS TOO SHORT AND INTEREST IN OUR WORK WAS ALWAYS UNABATED THE CABIN COULD NOT BE SEEN UNTIL THE TRAIL CAME QUITE NEAR IT WHEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF A CURL OF SMOKE I KNEW I WAS ALMOST THERE THEN I SAW THE CABIN
3830-12531-0010 AND A LITTLE LADY IN ALMOST BLOOMER DRESS MILKING THE COW SHE NEVER FINISHED MILKING THAT COW NOR DID SHE EVER MILK ANY COW WHEN HER HUSBAND WAS AT HOME THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS TO TALK ABOUT THAT WE COULD SCARCELY TELL WHERE TO BEGIN OR WHEN TO STOP
3830-12531-0011 MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION NATURALLY CENTERED ON THE QUESTION OF OUR MOVING TO A NEW HOME WHY AT OLYMPIA EGGS WERE A DOLLAR A DOZEN I SAW THEM SELLING AT THAT THE BUTTER YOU HAVE THERE WOULD BRING YOU A DOLLAR A POUND AS FAST AS YOU COULD WEIGH IT OUT
3830-12531-0012 I SAW STUFF THEY CALLED BUTTER SELL FOR THAT POTATOES ARE SELLING FOR THREE DOLLARS A BUSHEL AND ONIONS AT FOUR EVERYTHING THE FARMER RAISES SELLS HIGH WHO BUYS OH ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS TO BUY
3830-12531-0013 WHERE DO THEY GET THE MONEY EVERYBODY SEEMS TO HAVE MONEY SOME TAKE IT THERE WITH THEM MEN WORKING IN THE TIMBER CAMPS GET FOUR DOLLARS A DAY AND THEIR BOARD AT ONE PLACE THEY PAID FOUR DOLLARS A CORD FOR WOOD TO SHIP TO SAN FRANCISCO
3830-12531-0014 AND A MAN CAN SELL ALL THE SHINGLES HE CAN MAKE AT FOUR DOLLARS A THOUSAND I WAS OFFERED FIVE CENTS A FOOT FOR PILES IF WE HAD BUCK AND DANDY OVER THERE WE COULD MAKE TWENTY DOLLARS A DAY
3830-12531-0015 OFF THE GOVERNMENT LAND OF COURSE ALL HELP THEMSELVES TO WHAT THEY WANT THEN THERE ARE THE FISH AND THE CLAMS AND OYSTERS AND BUT WHAT ABOUT THE LAND FOR THE CLAIM THAT QUESTION WAS A STUMPER THE LITTLE WIFE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THAT BARGAIN MADE BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED
3830-12531-0016 NOW I FOUND MYSELF PRAISING A COUNTRY FOR THE AGRICULTURAL QUALITIES OF WHICH I COULD NOT SAY MUCH BUT IF WE COULD SELL PRODUCE HIGHER MIGHT WE NOT WELL LOWER OUR STANDARD OF AN IDEAL FARM THE CLAIM I HAD TAKEN WAS DESCRIBED WITH A TOUCH OF APOLOGY
3830-12531-0017 HOWEVER WE DECIDED TO MOVE AND BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR THE JOURNEY THE WIFE BABY BEDDING OX YOKE AND LOG CHAIN WERE SENT UP THE COWLITZ IN A CANOE BUCK AND DANDY AND I TOOK THE TRAIL
3830-12531-0018 ON THIS OCCASION I WAS ILL PREPARED FOR A COOL NIGHT CAMP HAVING NEITHER BLANKET NOR COAT I HAD EXPECTED TO REACH HARD BREAD'S HOTEL WHERE THE PEOPLE IN THE CANOE WOULD STOP OVERNIGHT BUT I COULD NOT MAKE IT SO AGAIN I LAY OUT ON THE TRAIL
3830-12531-0019 HARD BREAD'S AN ODD NAME FOR A HOTEL WAS SO CALLED BECAUSE THE OLD WIDOWER THAT KEPT THE PLACE FED HIS PATRONS ON HARDTACK THREE TIMES A DAY I FOUND THAT MY WIFE HAD NOT FARED ANY BETTER THAN I HAD ON THE TRAIL AND IN FACT
3830-12531-0020 NOT SO WELL THE FLOOR OF THE CABIN THAT IS THE HOTEL WAS A GREAT DEAL HARDER THAN THE SAND SPIT WHERE I HAD PASSED THE NIGHT I HAD PLENTY OF PURE FRESH AIR WHILE SHE IN A CLOSED CABIN
3830-12531-0021 AND IN THE SAME ROOM WITH MANY OTHERS HAD NEITHER FRESH AIR NOR FREEDOM FROM CREEPING THINGS THAT MAKE LIFE MISERABLE WITH HER SHOES FOR A PILLOW A SHAWL FOR COVERING SMALL WONDER THAT SHE REPORTED I DID NOT SLEEP A WINK LAST NIGHT
3830-12531-0022 WE SOON ARRIVED AT THE COWLITZ LANDING THE END OF THE CANOE JOURNEY STRIKING THE TENT THAT HAD SERVED US SO WELL ON THE PLAINS AND MAKING A CHEERFUL CAMP FIRE WE SPEEDILY FORGOT THE HARD EXPERIENCES OF THE TRAIL
3830-12531-0023 FIFTY MILES MORE OF TRAVEL LAY BEFORE US AND SUCH A ROAD HOWEVER WE HAD ONE CONSOLATION IT WOULD BE WORSE IN WINTER THAN AT THAT TIME
3830-12531-0024 OUR COWS WERE GONE GIVEN FOR PROVENDER TO SAVE THE LIVES OF THE OXEN DURING THE DEEP DECEMBER SNOW SO WHEN WE TOOK ACCOUNT OF STOCK WE HAD THE BABY BUCK AND DANDY A TENT AN OX YOKE AND CHAIN ENOUGH CLOTHING AND BEDDING TO KEEP US COMFORTABLE
3830-12531-0025 A VERY LITTLE FOOD AND NO MONEY THE MONEY HAD ALL BEEN EXPENDED ON THE CANOE PASSAGE SHOULD WE PACK THE OXEN AND WALK
3830-12531-0026 THIS LAST PROPOSITION WAS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE AND SO NEXT MORNING DRIVING MY OXEN BEFORE ME AND LEAVING WIFE AND BABY TO TAKE CARE OF THE CAMP
3830-12531-0027 STRANGER THOUGH I WAS TO SAY YES YOU CAN HAVE TWO IF YOU NEED THEM JACKSON HAD SETTLED THERE EIGHT YEARS BEFORE
3830-12531-0028 THE DREAD DISEASE HAD TERRORS THEN THAT IT DOES NOT NOW POSSESS COULD IT BE POSSIBLE MY FOLKS HAD BEEN TAKEN SICK
3830-12531-0029 IT APPEARED THAT I HAD SCARCELY GOT OUT OF SIGHT ON MY TRIP BACK WITH THE OXEN BEFORE ONE OF THOSE ROYAL PIONEER MATRONS HAD COME TO THE CAMP SHE PLEADED AND INSISTED AND FINALLY ALMOST FRIGHTENED THE LITTLE WIFE INTO GOING WITH HER
3830-12531-0030 AND SHARING HER HOUSE WHICH WAS NEAR BY
3830-12531-0031 FINDING THAT THE BOAT AND PROVISIONS HAD BEEN TAKEN AND SEEING SMOKE IN THE BIGHT
3830-12535-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN FINDING MY PEOPLE ON LEAVING MY NEWLY FOUND FRIENDS I FACED A DISCOURAGING PROSPECT THE START FOR THE HIGH ARID TABLE LANDS BORDERING THE YAKIMA VALLEY CUT ME LOOSE FROM ALL COMMUNICATION
3830-12535-0001 NO MORE IMMIGRANTS WERE MET UNTIL I REACHED THE MAIN TRAVELED ROUTE BEYOND THE COLUMBIA RIVER THE ROAD LAY THROUGH A FORBIDDING SAGE PLAIN OR RATHER AN UNDULATING COUNTRY COVERED BY SHIFTING SANDS
3830-12535-0002 AS THE SUN ROSE THE HEAT BECAME INTOLERABLE THE DUST IN PLACES BROUGHT VIVID MEMORIES OF THE TRIP ACROSS THE PLAINS
3830-12535-0003 TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE EXPECTED TRAIN
3830-12535-0004 AND COMPELLED ME TO LEAVE THE ROAD AND DESCEND INTO THE VALLEY FOR WATER
3830-12535-0005 THAT LASTED UNTIL DURING THE AFTERNOON WHEN I FOUND WATER ON THE TRAIL TETHERING MY PONY FOR HIS MUCH NEEDED DINNER I OPENED MY SACK OF HARD BREAD TO COUNT THE CONTENTS MY STORE WAS HALF GONE I LAY DOWN IN THE SHADE OF A SMALL TREE
3830-12535-0006 NEAR THE SPRING TO TAKE AN AFTERNOON NAP ROUSING BEFORE SUNDOWN REFRESHED BOBBY AND I TOOK THE TRAIL WITH NEW COURAGE WHEN NIGHT CAME I COULD NOT FIND IT IN MY HEART TO CAMP THE COOL OF THE EVENING INVIGORATED THE PONY AND WE PUSHED ON
3830-12535-0007 FINDING THAT THE ROAD COULD BE FOLLOWED THOUGH BUT DIMLY SEEN I KEPT ON THE TRAIL UNTIL A LATE HOUR WHEN I UNSADDLED AND HOBBLED THE PONY THE SADDLE BLANKET WAS BROUGHT INTO USE AND I WAS SOON OFF IN DREAMLAND FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE DUST THE TRAIL OR THE MORROW
3830-12535-0008 TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE HIS HOBBLES HAD BECOME LOOSENED GIVING HIM FREE USE OF ALL HIS FEET AND HE WAS IN NO MOOD TO TAKE THE TRAIL AGAIN COAXING WAS OF NO AVAIL DRIVING WOULD DO NO GOOD
3830-12535-0009 I FOLLOWED HIM AROUND ABOUT OVER THE PLAIN AND THROUGH THE SAGE BRUSH AT A RAPID GAIT FINALLY HE SLACKENED PACE AND I AGAIN BECAME MASTER
3830-12535-0010 ALL THIS ROAMING OVER THE PLAIN AT BOBBY'S HEELS BUT I HAPPENED TO TAKE THE RIGHT COURSE WHEN THE TRAIL WAS FOUND THERE WAS THE SADDLE TO LOOK FOR AND THIS WAS LOCATED WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
3830-12535-0011 A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF TRAVEL BROUGHT UNEASINESS AS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WE WERE NOT ON THE REGULAR TRAIL NOT KNOWING BUT THIS WAS SOME CUT OFF I WENT ON UNTIL THE COLUMBIA RIVER BLUFF WAS REACHED AND THE GREAT RIVER WAS IN SIGHT
3830-12535-0012 HALF A MILE DISTANT AND SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET LOWER TAKING A TRAIL DOWN THE BLUFF THAT SEEMED MORE PROMISING THAN THE WAGON TRACKS I BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR THE ROAD AT THE FOOT OF THE BLUFF
3830-12535-0013 ONLY TO FIND EVERY SEMBLANCE OF A ROAD GONE I LOST MORE THAN A HALF DAY'S PRECIOUS TIME AND AGAIN WAS THROWN INTO ANXIETY LEST I HAD MISSED THE LONG SOUGHT TRAIN THE NEXT INCIDENT THAT I REMEMBER VIVIDLY WAS MY ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE COLUMBIA
3830-12535-0014 JUST BELOW THE MOUTH OF THE SNAKE RIVER I HAD SEEN BUT FEW INDIANS ON THE WHOLE TRIP AND IN FACT THE CAMP I FOUND THERE ON THE BANK OF THE GREAT RIVER WAS THE FIRST I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER COMING UPON I COULD NOT INDUCE THE INDIANS TO CROSS ME OVER
3830-12535-0015 THEY SEEMED SURLY AND UNFRIENDLY THEIR BEHAVIOR WAS SO IN CONTRAST TO THAT OF THE INDIANS ON THE SOUND THAT I COULD NOT HELP WONDERING WHAT IT MEANT NO ONE TO MY KNOWLEDGE LOST HIS LIFE AT THE HANDS OF THE INDIANS THAT SEASON
3830-12535-0016 UNTIL I WAS HOARSE FROM THE VIOLENT EFFORT FINALLY WHILE SITTING THERE WONDERING WHAT TO DO I SPIED A BLUE SMOKE ARISING FROM A CABIN ON THE OTHER SIDE SOON AFTER I SAW A MAN HE IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED TO MY RENEWED EFFORTS TO ATTRACT ATTENTION
3830-12535-0017 THE TROUBLE HAD BEEN THAT THE PEOPLE WERE ALL ASLEEP WHILE I WAS THERE IN THE EARLY MORNING EXPENDING MY BREATH FOR NOTHING THE MAN WAS SHIRLEY ENSIGN OF OLYMPIA WHO HAD ESTABLISHED A FERRY ACROSS THE COLUMBIA RIVER AND HAD LINGERED TO SET OVER BELATED IMMIGRANTS IF ANY SHOULD COME ALONG
3830-12535-0018 AND HAD MET MY PEOPLE THEY WERE CAMPED SOME THIRTY MILES AWAY HE THOUGHT
3830-12535-0019 BUT I COULD NOT WAIT THERE FOR THEM
3830-12535-0020 DETERMINED TO REACH CAMP THAT NIGHT IF I COULD POSSIBLY DO SO
3830-12535-0021 DUSK CAME ON AND STILL NO SIGNS THEN I SPIED SOME CATTLE GRAZING ON THE UPLAND AND SOON CAME UPON THE CAMP IN A RAVINE THAT HAD SHUT IT FROM VIEW REJOICING AND OUTBURSTS OF GRIEF FOLLOWED I INQUIRED FOR MY MOTHER THE FIRST THING
3830-12535-0022 SHE WAS NOT THERE MONTHS BEFORE SHE HAD BEEN BURIED IN THE SANDS OF THE PLATTE VALLEY MY YOUNGER BROTHER ALSO LAY BURIED ON THE PLAINS NEAR INDEPENDENCE ROCK
3830-12535-0023 WHEN WE CAME TO CONSIDER HOW THE PARTY SHOULD PROCEED I ADVISED THE OVER MOUNTAIN TRIP BUT I CAUTIONED THEM TO EXPECT SOME SNOW AND MUCH HARD WORK HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE THEY ASKED ABOUT THREE WEEKS THIS BROUGHT DISAPPOINTMENT
3830-12535-0024 THEY HAD THOUGHT THEY WERE ABOUT THROUGH WITH THE JOURNEY YOU CAME TO STAY WITH US DIDN'T YOU I WANT TO BUT WHAT ABOUT MY WIFE AND THE TWO BABIES AT THE ISLAND FATHER SAID SOME ONE MUST GO AND LOOK AFTER THEM SO OLIVER WAS SENT AHEAD
3830-12535-0025 WHILE I WAS TO TAKE HIS PLACE AND HELP THE IMMIGRANTS THROUGH THE NATCHESS PASS IN OUR TRAIN WERE FIFTY OR MORE HEAD OF STOCK SEVEN WAGONS AND SEVENTEEN PEOPLE WE MADE THE TRIP ACROSS THE DIVIDE IN TWENTY TWO DAYS WITHOUT SERIOUS MISHAP OR LOSS
3830-12535-0026 THAT BESET OUR WAY AT EVERY STEP EVERY MAN LITERALLY PUT HIS SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL WE WERE COMPELLED OFTEN TO TAKE HOLD OF THE WHEELS TO BOOST THE WAGONS OVER THE LOGS OR TO EASE THEM DOWN STEEP PLACES
3830-12535-0027 ONE MAN TO EACH WAGON TO DRIVE FOUR TO ACT AS WHEELMEN FATHER AND THE WOMEN ON FOOT OR HORSEBACK TO DRIVE THE STOCK GOD BLESS THE WOMEN FOLKS OF THE PLAINS NOBLER BRAVER MORE UNCOMPLAINING SOULS WERE NEVER KNOWN
3830-12535-0028 I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT SOME ONE OUGHT TO WRITE A JUST TRIBUTE TO THEIR VALOR AND PATIENCE A BOOK OF THEIR HEROIC DEEDS ONE DAY WE ENCOUNTERED A NEWLY FALLEN TREE COCKED UP ON ITS OWN UPTURNED ROOTS FOUR FEET FROM THE GROUND GO AROUND IT WE COULD NOT
3830-12535-0029 TO CUT IT OUT WITH OUR DULLED FLIMSY SAW SEEMED AN ENDLESS TASK DIG DOWN BOYS SAID FATHER AND IN SHORT ORDER EVERY AVAILABLE SHOVEL WAS OUT OF THE WAGONS VERY SOON THE WAY WAS OPEN FULLY FOUR FEET DEEP AND OXEN AND WAGONS PASSED UNDER THE OBSTRUCTION
3830-12535-0030 DO YOU SAY THAT WE ENDURED GREAT HARDSHIPS THAT DEPENDS UPON THE POINT OF VIEW AS TO THIS RETURN TRIP I CAN TRULY SAY FOR MYSELF THAT IT WAS NOT ONE OF HARDSHIP I ENJOYED OVERCOMING THE DIFFICULTIES AND SO DID THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE COMPANY
3830-12535-0031 BUT BETTER FOOD WAS OBTAINABLE AND THE GOAL WAS NEAR AT HAND IT WAS A POSITIVE PLEASURE THEREFORE TO PASS OVER THE MILES ONE BY ONE
3830-12535-0032 WHEN OUR LITTLE TRAIN AT LAST EMERGED FROM THE FORESTS AND CAME OUT INTO THE NISQUALLY PLAINS
3830-12535-0033 SO MARKED WAS THE CONTRAST HUNDREDS OF CATTLE SHEEP AND HORSES WERE QUIETLY GRAZING SCATTERED OVER THE LANDSCAPE AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE
3857-180923-0000 THE PRECEDING PAGES HAVE OUTLINED THE CAREER OF THE SECOND CONNECTICUT HEAVY ARTILLERY AND HAVE NARRATED SOME OF THE MORE MEMORABLE EVENTS OF ITS HISTORY ENOUGH HAS BEEN TOLD OF WHAT IT DID TO FURNISH GROUNDS FOR DEDUCING WHAT IT WAS
3857-180923-0001 BUT TO DEAL WITH THE REGIMENT ON THE PERSONAL SIDE IS HARDLY POSSIBLE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF SUCH A SKETCH AS THIS THOUGH IT IS A MATTER THAT CANNOT BE ENTIRELY PASSED BY
3857-180923-0002 MADE UP THE ORGANIZATION WHOSE NOT UNEVENTFUL EXISTENCE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED THAT THEY WERE BETTER MEN OR WORSE BRAVER MEN OR MORE PATRIOTIC THAN THEIR DESCENDANTS AND SUCCESSORS WOULD PROVE UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS
3857-180923-0003 OR THAN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THEIR CONTEMPORARIES WHO DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO THE SAME SERVICE IS NOT TO BE BELIEVED YET TO HAVE PASSED THROUGH SUCH EXPERIENCES AS HAVE BEEN RECOUNTED WHICH BECAME FOR THEM FOR A TIME THE COMMONPLACES OF EVERY DAY LIFE
3857-180923-0004 IS ENOUGH TO PLACE THEM APART FROM ORDINARY MEN IN THE EYES OF OUR PEACE KNOWING GENERATION IN FACT TO HAVE PASSED THE TESTS OF SO FIERCE A COURSE OF EDUCATION GIVES THEM A TITLE TO A PLACE THUS APART THE UNIVERSITY MAN OF TO DAY
3857-180923-0005 AS THE BURDEN OF THE BACCALAUREATE SERMONS SO FREQUENTLY TESTIFIES IS CONSIGNED TO A SPECIAL PLACE OF RESPONSIBILITY IN LIFE BECAUSE OF HIS TRAINING THESE MEN SURELY EARNED ONE OF SPECIAL HONOR BY REASON OF THEIRS WHICH WAS TOO
3857-180923-0006 NOT LIKE THE OTHER PREPARATION ALONE BUT ALSO FULFILMENT THE REALIZATION OF HOW TYPICAL IT ALL WAS OF THAT GENERATION AND THAT TIME BRINGS THE CLEAREST UNDERSTANDING OF THE REAL SCOPE OF THE CIVIL WAR
3857-180923-0007 A NUMBER OF THE OFFICERS AND MEN WERE COLLEGE GRADUATES WHEN THEY ENLISTED AND OTHERS GAINED DEGREES AFTER THE WAR ENDED THE LIST WHICH FOLLOWS IS HOWEVER NECESSARILY INCOMPLETE IN FACT AN ABSOLUTELY CORRECT LIST IS NO DOUBT HOPELESSLY IMPOSSIBLE
3857-180923-0008 AND WAS ENLISTED AS CAPTAIN OF A COMPANY WHICH HE HAD BEEN ACTIVE IN RECRUITING LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SMITH OF WOODBURY ENTERED THE YALE LAW SCHOOL IN THE CLASS OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE BUT DID NOT GRADUATE

3857-180923-0011 AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH IN EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN HE WAS A LECTURER IN THE YALE LAW SCHOOL AND MEMBER OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ERRORS
3857-180923-0012 CAPTAIN AND BREVET MAJOR WAS A GRADUATE OF WILLIAMS IN THE CLASS OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN HE WAS PASTOR OF THE CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH AT EAST CANAAN WHEN THE REGIMENT WAS ORGANIZED AND WAS ONE OF ITS RECRUITING OFFICERS ADJUTANT THEODORE F VAILL

3857-180923-0020 THERE ARE NOT A FEW OTHER NAMES UPON THE ROLLS OF THE REGIMENT WHICH UPON MORE THOROUGH INVESTIGATION THAN HAS BEEN POSSIBLE IN THE PRESENT CASE WOULD CERTAINLY BE ADDED TO THE LIST
3857-180923-0021 A COMPLETE HISTORY OF THE ORGANIZATION WOULD ALSO GIVE A LARGE PLACE TO THE ASSOCIATION OF ITS VETERANS FORMED SHORTLY AFTER THE WAR WHOSE FREQUENT GATHERINGS HAVE MORE THAN A SUPERFICIAL LIKENESS TO THE REUNIONS OF COLLEGE CLASSES
3857-180923-0022 MEMORABLE AMONG THESE MEETINGS WAS THE ONE HELD ON OCTOBER TWENTY FIRST EIGHTEEN NINETY SIX THE OCCASION BEING THE DEDICATION OF THE REGIMENT'S MONUMENT IN THE NATIONAL CEMETERY AT ARLINGTON
3857-180923-0023 AS A WHOLE THE REGIMENT WAS A BODY THOROUGHLY REPRESENTATIVE NOT ONLY OF THE ARMY OF WHICH IT WAS A FRACTION AN ARMY AS HAS BEEN OFTEN SAID UNLIKE ANY OTHER THE WORLD HAS KNOWN BUT ALSO OF THE POPULATION FROM WHICH IT WAS DRAWN
3857-180923-0024 IT WAS MADE UP OF MEN OF ALMOST ALL CONDITIONS OF LIFE AND OF WIDELY DIFFERENT AGES THOUGH NATURALLY WITH YOUNG MEN IN A LARGE MAJORITY OF MECHANICS FROM THE HOUSATONIC AND NAUGATUCK VALLEYS AND FARMERS BOYS FROM THE HILLS OF MEN OF EDUCATION AND MEN OF NONE
3857-180923-0025 THOUGH THE LARGE ADDITION TO ITS NUMBERS WHICH THE INCREASE IN SIZE NECESSITATED MADE IT PERHAPS SOMEWHAT LESS HOMOGENEOUS THAN AT FIRST IT DID NOT GREATLY ALTER ITS ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS
3857-180923-0026 THE RECORDS KEPT BY THE ASSOCIATION REFERRED TO FURNISH SUGGESTIVE REVELATIONS AS TO THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS THAT COMPOSED IT THE NAMES OF MEN OF EVERY SORT AND KIND ARE FOUND UPON THE ROLLS THERE WERE VETERANS OF THE MEXICAN WAR
3857-180923-0027 THERE WERE REFUGEES FROM THE REVOLUTIONARY UPRISINGS IN EUROPE OF EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT THERE WERE SOME WHO HAD SERVED UNDER COMPULSION IN THE ARMIES OF THE SOUTH THERE WERE MEN WHOSE OBVIOUSLY FICTITIOUS NAMES CONCEALED STORIES WHICH COULD BE GUESSED TO BE EXTRAORDINARY
3857-180923-0028 THERE WERE NAMES WHICH HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS AMONG THE BEST KNOWN AND MOST HONORED IN THIS STATE AND THERE WERE THOSE OF OUTCASTS AND WRECKS A LARGE PART OF THESE MEN CAME BACK AFTER THEIR SERVICE ENDED TO RESUME THE PEACEFUL LIFE OF CITIZENSHIP
3857-180923-0029 AND EVERY TOWN AMONG US HAS KNOWN SOME OF THEM EVER SINCE AMONG ITS LEADING FIGURES WHILE SOME IN QUARTERS FAR DISTANT HAVE ALSO ATTAINED TO HONORS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AS THE RECORDS SHOW
3857-182315-0000 HOW I HATE THE MAN WHO TALKS ABOUT THE BRUTE CREATION WITH AN UGLY EMPHASIS ON BRUTE AS FOR ME I AM PROUD OF MY CLOSE KINSHIP WITH OTHER ANIMALS
3857-182315-0001 I TAKE A JEALOUS PRIDE IN MY SIMIAN ANCESTRY I LIKE TO THINK THAT I WAS ONCE A MAGNIFICENT HAIRY FELLOW LIVING IN THE TREES AND THAT MY FRAME HAS COME DOWN THROUGH GEOLOGICAL TIME VIA SEA JELLY AND WORMS
3857-182315-0002 AND AMPHIOXUS FISH DINOSAURS AND APES WHO WOULD EXCHANGE THESE FOR THE PALLID COUPLE IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN W N P BARBELLION
3857-182315-0003 LAST SUNDAY POTTER TOOK ME OUT DRIVING ALONG UPPER BROADWAY WHERE THOSE LONG ROWS OF TALL NEW APARTMENT HOUSES WERE BUILT A FEW YEARS AGO IT WAS A MILD AFTERNOON AND GREAT CROWDS OF PEOPLE WERE OUT
3857-182315-0004 SUNDAY AFTERNOON CROWDS THEY WERE NOT GOING ANYWHERE THEY WERE JUST STROLLING UP AND DOWN STARING AT EACH OTHER AND TALKING THERE WERE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF THEM
3857-182315-0005 I TURNED AND ASKED WHY WHAT ABOUT THEM I WASN'T SURE WHETHER HE HAD AN IDEA OR A HEADACHE OTHER CREATURES DON'T DO IT HE REPLIED WITH A DISCOURAGED EXPRESSION
3857-182315-0006 ARE ANY OTHER BEINGS EVER FOUND IN SUCH MASSES BUT VERMIN AIMLESS STARING VACANT MINDED LOOK AT THEM
3857-182315-0007 I CAN GET NO SENSE WHATEVER OF INDIVIDUAL WORTH OR OF VALUE IN MEN AS A RACE WHEN I SEE THEM LIKE THIS IT MAKES ONE ALMOST DESPAIR OF CIVILIZATION I THOUGHT THIS OVER FOR AWHILE
3857-182315-0008 AND YET AT OTHER TIMES I TOO FEEL LIKE A SPECTATOR AN ALIEN BUT EVEN THEN I HAD NEVER FELT SO ALIEN OR DESPAIRING AS POTTER LET'S REMEMBER I SAID IT'S A SIMIAN CIVILIZATION
3857-182315-0009 POTTER WAS STARING DISGUSTEDLY AT SOME VAUDEVILLE SIGN BOARDS YES I SAID THOSE FOR EXAMPLE ARE DISTINCTIVELY SIMIAN WHY SHOULD YOU FEEL DISAPPOINTMENT AT SOMETHING INEVITABLE AND I WENT ON TO ARGUE THAT IT WASN'T AS THOUGH WE WERE DESCENDED FROM
3857-182315-0010 EAGLES FOR INSTANCE INSTEAD OF BROADLY SPEAKING FROM APE LIKE OR MONKEYISH BEINGS BEING OF SIMIAN STOCK WE HAD SIMIAN TRAITS OUR DEVELOPMENT NATURALLY BORE THE MARKS OF OUR ORIGIN
3857-182315-0011 WHAT COULD YOU EXPECT TWO IF WE HAD BEEN MADE DIRECTLY FROM CLAY THE WAY IT SAYS IN THE BIBLE AND HAD THEREFORE INHERITED NO INTERMEDIATE CHARACTERISTICS
3857-182315-0012 IF A GOD OR SOME PRINCIPLE OF GROWTH HAD GONE THAT WAY TO WORK WITH US HE OR IT MIGHT HAVE MOLDED US IN MUCH MORE SPLENDID FORMS BUT CONSIDERING OUR SIMIAN DESCENT IT HAS DONE VERY WELL
3857-182315-0013 THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE DISAPPOINTED IN US ARE THOSE WHO STILL BELIEVE THAT CLAY STORY OR WHO UNCONSCIOUSLY STILL LET IT COLOR THEIR THINKING THERE CERTAINLY SEEMS TO BE A POWER AT WORK IN THE WORLD
3857-182315-0014 BY VIRTUE OF WHICH EVERY LIVING THING GROWS AND DEVELOPS AND IT TENDS TOWARD SPLENDOR SEEDS BECOME TREES AND WEAK LITTLE NATIONS GROW GREAT BUT THE PUSH OR THE FORCE THAT IS DOING THIS THE YEAST AS IT WERE
3857-182315-0015 HAS TO WORK IN AND ON CERTAIN DEFINITE KINDS OF MATERIAL BECAUSE THIS YEAST IS IN US THERE MAY BE GREAT AND UNDREAMED OF POSSIBILITIES AWAITING MANKIND BUT BECAUSE OF OUR LINE OF DESCENT
3857-182315-0016 THERE ARE ALSO QUEER LIMITATIONS THREE IN THOSE DISTANT INVISIBLE EPOCHS BEFORE MEN EXISTED BEFORE EVEN THE PROUD MISSING LINK STRUTTED AROUND THROUGH THE WOODS
3857-182315-0017 LITTLE REALIZING HOW WE HIS GREATGRANDSONS WOULD SMILE WRYLY AT HIM MUCH AS OUR OWN DESCENDANTS MAY SHUDDER AT US AGES HENCE THE VARIOUS ANIMALS WERE DESPERATELY COMPETING FOR POWER THEY COULDN'T OR DIDN'T LIVE AS EQUALS
3857-182315-0018 CERTAIN GROUPS SOUGHT THE HEADSHIP MANY STRANGE FORGOTTEN DYNASTIES ROSE MET DEFIANCE AND FELL IN THE END IT WAS OUR ANCESTORS WHO WON AND BECAME SIMIAN KINGS AND BEQUEATHED A WHOLE PLANET TO US
3857-182315-0019 AND KEPT US IN CAGES OR SHOW US FOR SPORT IN THE FOREST WHILE THEY RULED THE WORLD SO POTTER AND I DEVELOPING THIS TRAIN OF THOUGHT BEGAN TO IMAGINE WE HAD LIVED MANY AGES AGO AND SOMEHOW OR OTHER HAD ALIGHTED HERE FROM SOME OLDER PLANET
3857-182315-0020 FAMILIAR WITH THE WAYS OF EVOLUTION ELSEWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE WE NATURALLY SHOULD HAVE WONDERED WHAT COURSE IT WOULD TAKE ON THIS EARTH EVEN IN THIS OUT OF THE WAY CORNER OF THE COSMOS WE MIGHT HAVE REFLECTED AND ON THIS TINY STAR
3857-182315-0021 IT MAY BE OF INTEREST TO CONSIDER THE TREND OF EVENTS WE SHOULD HAVE TRIED TO APPRAISE THE DIFFERENT SPECIES AS THEY WANDERED AROUND EACH WITH ITS OWN SET OF GOOD AND BAD CHARACTERISTICS WHICH GROUP WE'D HAVE WONDERED WOULD EVER CONTRIVE TO RULE ALL THE REST
3857-182315-0022 AND HOW GREAT A DEVELOPMENT COULD THEY ATTAIN TO THEREAFTER
3857-182315-0023 WE MIGHT FIRST HAVE CONSIDERED THE LEMURS OR APES THEY HAD HANDS AESTHETICALLY VIEWED THE POOR SIMIANS WERE SIMPLY GROTESQUE BUT TRAVELERS WHO KNEW OTHER PLANETS MIGHT HAVE KNOWN WHAT BEAUTY MAY SPRING FROM AN UNCOUTH BEGINNING IN THIS MAGIC UNIVERSE
3857-182315-0024 STILL THOSE FROWSY UNLOVELY HORDES OF APES AND MONKEYS WERE SO COMPLETELY LACKING IN SIGNS OF KINGSHIP THEY WERE SO FLIGHTY TOO IN THEIR WAYS AND HAD SO LITTLE PURPOSE AND SO MUCH LOVE FOR ABSURD AND IDLE CHATTER
3857-182315-0025 THEY ARE NOT EASILY LEFT BEHIND EVEN AFTER LONG STAGES AND THEY FORM A TERRIBLE OBSTACLE TO ALL HIGH ADVANCEMENT
3857-182315-0026 THE BEES OR THE ANTS MIGHT HAVE SEEMED TO US MORE PROMISING THEIR SMALLNESS OF SIZE WAS NOT NECESSARILY TOO MUCH OF A HANDICAP THEY COULD HAVE MADE POISON THEIR WEAPON FOR THE SUBJUGATION OF RIVALS
3857-182315-0027 AND IN THESE ORDERLY INSECTS THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY A CAPACITY FOR LABOR AND CO OPERATIVE LABOR AT THAT WHICH COULD CARRY THEM FAR WE ALL KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A MARKED GENIUS GREAT GIFTS OF THEIR OWN
3857-182315-0028 IN A CIVILIZATION OF SUPER ANTS OR BEES THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO PROBLEM OF THE HUNGRY UNEMPLOYED NO POVERTY NO UNSTABLE GOVERNMENT NO RIOTS NO STRIKES FOR SHORT HOURS
3857-182315-0029 NO DERISION OF EUGENICS NO THIEVES PERHAPS NO CRIME AT ALL ANTS ARE GOOD CITIZENS THEY PLACE GROUP INTERESTS FIRST BUT THEY CARRY IT SO FAR THEY HAVE FEW OR NO POLITICAL RIGHTS
3857-182315-0030 AN ANT DOESN'T HAVE THE VOTE APPARENTLY HE JUST HAS HIS DUTIES THIS QUALITY MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THEIR HAVING GROUPS WARS THE EGOTISM OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL SPIRITS IS ALLOWED SCANT EXPRESSION
3857-182315-0031 SO THE EGOTISM OF THE GROUPS IS EXTREMELY FEROCIOUS AND ACTIVE IS THIS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY ANTS FIGHT SO MUCH WE HAVE SEEN THE SAME PHENOMENON OCCUR IN CERTAIN NATIONS OF MEN AND THE ANTS COMMIT ATROCITIES IN AND AFTER THEIR BATTLES THAT ARE
3857-182315-0032 I WISH I COULD TRULY SAY INHUMAN BUT CONVERSELY ANTS ARE ABSOLUTELY UNSELFISH WITHIN THE COMMUNITY THEY ARE SKILFUL INGENIOUS THEIR NESTS AND BUILDINGS ARE RELATIVELY LARGER THAN MAN'S
3857-182315-0033 THE SCIENTISTS SPEAK OF THEIR PAVED STREETS VAULTED HALLS THEIR HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT DOMESTICATED ANIMALS THEIR PLUCK AND INTELLIGENCE THEIR INDIVIDUAL INITIATIVE THEIR CHASTE AND INDUSTRIOUS LIVES
3857-182315-0034 DARWIN SAID THE ANT'S BRAIN WAS ONE OF THE MOST MARVELOUS ATOMS IN THE WORLD PERHAPS MORE SO THAN THE BRAIN OF MAN YES OF PRESENT DAY MAN WHO FOR THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS HAS HAD SO MUCH MORE CHANCE TO DEVELOP HIS BRAIN
3857-182315-0035 A THOUGHTFUL OBSERVER WOULD HAVE WEIGHED ALL THESE EXCELLENT QUALITIES WHEN WE THINK OF THESE CREATURES AS LITTLE MEN WHICH IS ALL WRONG OF COURSE WE SEE THEY HAVE THEIR FAULTS TO OUR EYES THEY SEEM TOO ORDERLY FOR INSTANCE
3857-182315-0036 REPRESSIVELY SO THEIR WAYS ARE MORE FIXED THAN THOSE OF THE OLD EGYPTIANS AND THEIR INDUSTRY IS PAINFUL TO THINK OF IT'S HYPER CHINESE BUT WE MUST REMEMBER THIS IS A SIMIAN COMMENT
3857-182315-0037 THE INSTINCTS OF THE SPECIES THAT YOU AND I BELONG TO ARE OF AN OPPOSITE KIND AND THAT MAKES IT HARD FOR US TO JUDGE ANTS FAIRLY BUT WE AND THE ANTS ARE ALIKE IN ONE MATTER THE STRONG LOVE OF PROPERTY
3857-182315-0038 AND INSTEAD OF MERELY STRUGGLING WITH NATURE FOR IT THEY ALSO FIGHT OTHER ANTS THE CUSTOM OF PLUNDER SEEMS TO BE A PART OF MOST OF THEIR WARS THIS HAS GONE ON FOR AGES AMONG THEM AND CONTINUES TODAY
3857-182315-0039 RAIDS FEROCIOUS COMBATS AND LOOT ARE PART OF AN ANT'S REGULAR LIFE ANT REFORMERS IF THERE WERE ANY MIGHT LAY THIS TO THEIR PROPERTY SENSE AND TALK OF ABOLISHING PROPERTY AS A CURE FOR THE EVIL
3857-182315-0040 BUT THAT WOULD NOT HELP FOR LONG UNLESS THEY COULD ABOLISH THE LOVE OF IT ANTS SEEM TO CARE EVEN MORE FOR PROPERTY THAN WE DO OURSELVES WE MEN ARE INCLINED TO EASE UP A LITTLE WHEN WE HAVE ALL WE NEED
3857-182315-0041 THEY CAN'T BEAR TO STOP THEY KEEP RIGHT ON WORKING THIS MEANS THAT ANTS DO NOT CONTEMPLATE THEY HEED NOTHING OUTSIDE OF THEIR OWN LITTLE ROUNDS IT IS ALMOST AS THOUGH THEIR FONDNESS FOR LABOR HAD CLOSED FAST THEIR MINDS
3857-182315-0042 CONCEIVABLY THEY MIGHT HAVE DEVELOPED INQUIRING MINDS BUT THIS WOULD HAVE RUN AGAINST THEIR STRONGEST INSTINCTS THE ANT IS KNOWING AND WISE BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW ENOUGH TO TAKE A VACATION
3857-182315-0043 WOULD THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE THEREWITH TO RULE THEIR INSTINCTS OR TO STOP WORK LONG ENOUGH TO EXAMINE THEMSELVES OR THE UNIVERSE OR TO DREAM OF ANY NOBLE DEVELOPMENT PROBABLY NOT REASON IS SELDOM OR NEVER THE RULER
3857-182315-0044 IT IS THE SERVANT OF INSTINCT IT WOULD THEREFORE HAVE TOLD THE ANTS THAT INCESSANT TOIL WAS USEFUL AND GOOD TOIL HAS BROUGHT YOU UP FROM THE RUCK OF THINGS REASON WOULD HAVE PLAUSIBLY SAID
3857-182315-0045 IT'S BY VIRTUE OF FEVERISH TOIL THAT YOU HAVE BECOME WHAT YOU ARE BEING ENDLESSLY INDUSTRIOUS IS THE BEST ROAD FOR YOU TO THE HEIGHTS
3857-182317-0000 SOME HAD OVER TRUSTFUL CHARACTERS LIKE THE SEALS OR EXPLOITABLE CHARACTERS LIKE COWS AND CHICKENS AND SHEEP SUCH CREATURES SENTENCE THEMSELVES TO BE CAPTIVES BY THEIR LACK OF AMBITION DOGS THEY HAVE MORE SPIRIT
3857-182317-0001 BUT THEY HAVE LOST THEIR CHANCE OF KINGSHIP THROUGH WORSHIPPING US THE DOG'S FINER QUALITIES CAN'T BE PRAISED TOO WARMLY THERE IS A PURITY ABOUT HIS DEVOTION WHICH MAKES MERE MEN FEEL SPEECHLESS BUT WITH ALL LOVE FOR DOGS
3857-182317-0002 ONE MUST GRANT THEY ARE VASSALS NOT RULERS THEY ARE TOO PARASITIC THE ONE WILLING SERVANT CLASS OF THE WORLD AND WE HAVE BETRAYED THEM BY MAKING UNDER SIMIANS OF THEM
3857-182317-0003 LOVING US THEY LET US STOP THEIR DEVELOPING IN TUNE WITH THEIR NATURES AND THEY'VE PATIENTLY TRIED EVER SINCE TO ADOPT WAYS OF OURS THEY HAVE DONE IT TOO BUT OF COURSE THEY CAN'T GET FAR IT'S NOT THEIR OWN ROAD
3857-182317-0004 DOGS HAVE MORE LOVE THAN INTEGRITY THEY'VE BEEN TRUE TO US YES BUT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TRUE TO THEMSELVES PIGS THE PIG IS REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT AND BRAVE BUT HE'S GROSS
3857-182317-0005 AND GROSSNESS DELAYS ONE'S ACHIEVEMENT IT TAKES SO MUCH TIME THE SNAKE TOO THOUGH WISE HAS A WAY OF EATING HIMSELF INTO STUPORS IF SUPER SNAKE MEN HAD HAD BANQUETS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO VAST TO DESCRIBE
3857-182317-0006 AND WELL SHOULD THE ELEPHANT KNOW IT HE HAD THE BEST CHANCE OF ALL WISER EVEN THAN THE LION OR THE WISEST OF APES HIS WISDOM FURTHERMORE WAS BENIGN WHERE THEIRS WAS SINISTER CONSIDER HIS DIGNITY HIS POISE AND SKILL
3857-182317-0007 HE WAS PLASTIC TOO HE HAD LEARNED TO EAT MANY FOODS AND ENDURE MANY CLIMATES ONCE SOME SAY THIS RACE EXPLORED THE GLOBE THEIR BONES ARE FOUND EVERYWHERE IN SOUTH AMERICA EVEN
3857-182317-0008 SO THE ELEPHANTS COLUMBUS MAY HAVE FOUND SOME ROAD HERE BEFORE OURS THEY ARE COSMOPOLITANS THESE SUAVE AND WELL BRED BEINGS THEY HAVE RICH EMOTIONAL NATURES LONG MEMORIES LOYALTY THEY ARE STEADY AND SURE
3857-182317-0009 AND NOT NARROW NOT SELF ABSORBED FOR THEY SEEM INTERESTED IN EVERYTHING WHAT WAS IT THEN THAT PUT THEM OUT OF THE RACE COULD IT HAVE BEEN A QUITE NATURAL BELIEF THAT THEY HAD ALREADY WON AND WHEN THEY SAW THAT THEY HADN'T
3857-182317-0010 AND THAT THE MONKEY MEN WERE GETTING AHEAD WERE THEY TOO GREAT MINDED AND DECENT TO EXTERMINATE THEIR PUNY RIVALS IT MAY HAVE BEEN THEIR TOLERANCE AND PATIENCE THAT BETRAYED THEM THEY WAIT TOO LONG BEFORE THEY RESENT AN IMPOSITION OR INSULT
3857-182317-0011 JUST AS ANTS ARE TOO ENERGETIC AND CATS TOO SHREWD FOR THEIR OWN HIGHEST GOOD SO THE ELEPHANTS SUFFER FROM TOO MUCH PATIENCE THEIR EXHIBITIONS OF IT MAY SEEM SUPERB SUCH POWER AND SUCH RESTRAINT COMBINED ARE NOBLE
3857-182317-0012 MORE LIVE AND LET LIVE IN ALLOWING OTHER SPECIES TO STAY HERE OUR WAY IS TO KILL GOOD AND BAD MALE AND FEMALE AND BABIES TILL THE FEW LAST SURVIVORS LIE HIDDEN AWAY FROM OUR GUNS
3857-182317-0013 ALL SPECIES MUST SURRENDER UNCONDITIONALLY THOSE ARE OUR TERMS AND COME AND LIVE IN BARNS ALONGSIDE US OR ON US AS PARASITES THE CREATURES THAT WANT TO LIVE A LIFE OF THEIR OWN WE CALL WILD IF WILD
3857-182317-0014 THEN NO MATTER HOW HARMLESS WE TREAT THEM AS OUTLAWS AND THOSE OF US WHO ARE SPECIALLY WELL BROUGHT UP SHOOT THEM FOR FUN SOME MIGHT BE OUR FRIENDS WE DON'T WISH IT WE KEEP THEM ALL TERRORIZED
3857-182317-0015 WHEN ONE OF US CONQUERING MONKEY MEN ENTERS THE WOODS MOST ANIMALS THAT SCENT HIM SLINK AWAY OR RACE OFF IN A PANIC IT IS NOT THAT WE HAVE PLANNED THIS DELIBERATELY BUT THEY KNOW WHAT WE'RE LIKE RACE BY RACE THEY HAVE BEEN SLAUGHTERED
3857-182317-0016 SOON ALL WILL BE GONE WE GIVE NEITHER FREEDOM NOR LIFE ROOM TO THOSE WE DEFEAT IF WE HAD BEEN AS STRONG AS THE ELEPHANTS WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN KINDER WHEN GREAT POWER COMES NATURALLY TO PEOPLE
3857-182317-0017 IT IS USED MORE URBANELY WE USE IT AS PARVENUS DO BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE ARE THE ELEPHANT BEING BORN TO IT IS EASY GOING CONFIDENT TOLERANT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A MORE HUMANE KING
3857-182317-0018 THE ELEPHANT IS STUPID WHEN IT COMES TO LEARNING HOW TO USE TOOLS SO ARE ALL OTHER SPECIES EXCEPT OUR OWN ISN'T IT STRANGE A TOOL IN THE MOST PRIMITIVE SENSE IS ANY OBJECT LYING AROUND
3857-182317-0019 THAT CAN OBVIOUSLY BE USED AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR THIS OR THAT PURPOSE MANY CREATURES USE OBJECTS AS MATERIALS AS BIRDS USE TWIGS FOR NESTS BUT THE STEP THAT NO ANIMAL TAKES IS LEARNING FREELY TO USE THINGS AS INSTRUMENTS
3857-182317-0020 WHEN AN ELEPHANT PLUCKS OFF A BRANCH AND SWISHES HIS FLANKS AND THUS KEEPS AWAY INSECTS HE IS USING A TOOL BUT HE DOES IT ONLY BY A VAGUE AND HAPHAZARD ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS IF HE ONCE BECAME A CONSCIOUS USER OF TOOLS
3857-182317-0021 HE WOULD OF COURSE GO MUCH FURTHER WE OURSELVES WHO ARE SO GOOD AT IT NOW WERE SLOW ENOUGH IN BEGINNING THINK OF THE LONG EPOCHS THAT PASSED BEFORE IT ENTERED OUR HEADS
3857-182317-0022 AND ALL THAT WHILE THE CONTEST FOR LEADERSHIP BLINDLY WENT ON WITHOUT ANY SPECIES MAKING USE OF THIS OBVIOUS AID THE LESSON TO BE LEARNED WAS SIMPLE THE REWARD WAS THE RULE OF A PLANET YET ONLY ONE SPECIES OUR OWN
3857-182317-0023 HAS EVER HAD THAT MUCH BRAINS IT MAKES YOU WONDER WHAT OTHER OBVIOUS LESSONS MAY STILL BE UNLEARNED IT IS NOT NECESSARILY STUPID HOWEVER TO FAIL TO USE TOOLS TO USE TOOLS INVOLVES USING REASON
3857-182317-0024 INSTEAD OF STICKING TO INSTINCT NOW STICKING TO INSTINCT HAS ITS DISADVANTAGES BUT SO HAS USING REASON WHICHEVER FACULTY YOU USE THE OTHER ATROPHIES AND PARTLY DESERTS YOU WE ARE TRYING TO USE BOTH
3857-182317-0025 BUT WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHICH HAS THE MORE VALUE A SUDDEN VISION COMES TO ME OF ONE OF THE FIRST FAR AWAY APE MEN WHO TRIED TO USE REASON INSTEAD OF INSTINCT AS A GUIDE FOR HIS CONDUCT I IMAGINE HIM PERCHED IN HIS TREE
3857-182317-0026 TORN BETWEEN THOSE TWO VOICES WAILING LOUDLY AT NIGHT BY A RIVER IN HIS PUZZLED DISTRESS MY POOR FAR OFF BROTHER
3857-182317-0027 AND THEREAFTER ACHIEVE A HIGH CIVILIZATION BUT THAT WASN'T THE PROBLEM THE REAL PROBLEM
3857-182317-0028 SOME QUENCHLESS DESIRE TO URGE THEM ON AND ON AND ALSO ADAPTABILITY OF A THOUSAND KINDS TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT THE RHINOCEROS CARES LITTLE FOR ADAPTABILITY HE SLOGS THROUGH THE WORLD BUT WE
3857-182317-0029 WE ARE EXPERTS ADAPTABILITY IS WHAT WE DEPEND ON WE TALK OF OUR MASTERY OF NATURE WHICH SOUNDS VERY GRAND BUT THE FACT IS WE RESPECTFULLY ADAPT OURSELVES FIRST TO HER WAYS
3857-182317-0030 WE ATTAIN NO POWER OVER NATURE TILL WE LEARN NATURAL LAWS AND OUR LORDSHIP DEPENDS ON THE ADROITNESS WITH WHICH WE LEARN AND CONFORM ADROITNESS HOWEVER IS MERELY AN ABILITY TO WIN
3857-182317-0031 BACK OF IT THERE MUST BE SOME SPUR TO MAKE US USE OUR ADROITNESS WHY DON'T WE ALL DIE OR GIVE UP WHEN WE'RE SICK OF THE WORLD BECAUSE THE LOVE OF LIFE IS REENFORCED IN MOST ENERGIZED BEINGS
3857-182317-0032 BY SOME LONGING THAT PUSHES THEM FORWARD IN DEFEAT AND IN DARKNESS ALL CREATURES WISH TO LIVE AND TO PERPETUATE THEIR SPECIES OF COURSE BUT THOSE TWO WISHES ALONE EVIDENTLY DO NOT CARRY ANY RACE FAR
3857-182317-0033 IN ADDITION TO THESE A RACE TO BE GREAT NEEDS SOME HUNGER SOME ITCH TO SPUR IT UP THE HARD PATH WE LATELY HAVE LEARNED TO CALL EVOLUTION THE LOVE OF TOIL IN THE ANTS AND OF CRAFT IN CATS ARE EXAMPLES
3879-173592-0000 SAGACIOUS BOLD AND RESTLESS HE PUSHED HIS WAY FROM TOWN TO TOWN AND PRETENDED TO HAVE REACHED THE MYSTERIOUS MOUNTAINS OF APPALACHE HE SENT TO THE FORT MANTLES WOVEN WITH FEATHERS QUIVERS COVERED WITH CHOICE FURS
3879-173592-0001 ARROWS TIPPED WITH GOLD WEDGES OF A GREEN STONE LIKE BERYL OR EMERALD AND OTHER TROPHIES OF HIS WANDERINGS A GENTLEMAN NAMED GROTAUT TOOK UP THE QUEST AND PENETRATED TO THE DOMINIONS OF HOSTAQUA
3879-173592-0002 WHO IT WAS PRETENDED COULD MUSTER THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND WARRIORS AND WHO PROMISED WITH THE AID OF A HUNDRED ARQUEBUSIERS TO CONQUER ALL THE KINGS OF THE ADJACENT MOUNTAINS AND SUBJECT THEM AND THEIR GOLD MINES TO THE RULE OF THE FRENCH
3879-173592-0003 A HUMBLER ADVENTURER WAS PIERRE GAMBIE A ROBUST AND DARING YOUTH
3879-173592-0004 AND WAS NOW A SOLDIER UNDER LAUDONNIERE THE LATTER GAVE HIM LEAVE TO TRADE WITH THE INDIANS A PRIVILEGE WHICH HE USED SO WELL THAT HE GREW RICH WITH HIS TRAFFIC BECAME PRIME FAVORITE WITH THE CHIEF OF THE ISLAND OF EDELANO
3879-173592-0005 MARRIED HIS DAUGHTER AND IN HIS ABSENCE REIGNED IN HIS STEAD BUT AS HIS SWAY VERGED TOWARDS DESPOTISM HIS SUBJECTS TOOK OFFENCE AND SPLIT HIS HEAD WITH A HATCHET DURING THE WINTER
3879-173592-0006 INDIANS FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF CAPE CANAVERAL BROUGHT TO THE FORT TWO SPANIARDS WRECKED FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE ON THE SOUTHWESTERN EXTREMITY OF THE PENINSULA
3879-173592-0007 THEY TOLD OF THE KING OF CABS ON WHOSE DOMAINS THEY HAD BEEN WRECKED A CHIEF MIGHTY IN STATURE AND IN POWER IN ONE OF HIS VILLAGES WAS A PIT SIX FEET DEEP AND AS WIDE AS A HOGSHEAD
3879-173592-0008 FILLED WITH TREASURE GATHERED FROM SPANISH WRECKS ON ADJACENT REEFS AND KEYS THE MONARCH WAS A PRIEST TOO AND A MAGICIAN WITH POWER OVER THE ELEMENTS EACH YEAR HE WITHDREW FROM THE PUBLIC GAZE
3879-173592-0009 TO HOLD CONVERSE IN SECRET WITH SUPERNAL OR INFERNAL POWERS AND EACH YEAR HE SACRIFICED TO HIS GODS ONE OF THE SPANIARDS WHOM THE FORTUNE OF THE SEA HAD CAST UPON HIS SHORES
3879-173592-0010 THE NAME OF THE TRIBE IS PRESERVED IN THAT OF THE RIVER CABOOSA IN CLOSE LEAGUE WITH HIM WAS THE MIGHTY OATHCAQUA DWELLING NEAR CAPE CANAVERAL WHO GAVE HIS DAUGHTER A MAIDEN OF WONDROUS BEAUTY
3879-173592-0011 IN MARRIAGE TO HIS GREAT ALLY BUT AS THE BRIDE WITH HER BRIDESMAIDS WAS JOURNEYING TOWARDS CALOS ESCORTED BY A CHOSEN BAND THEY WERE ASSAILED BY A WILD AND WARLIKE RACE INHABITANTS OF AN ISLAND CALLED
3879-173592-0012 IN THE MIDST OF A LAKE WHO PUT THE WARRIORS TO FLIGHT BORE THE MAIDENS CAPTIVE TO THEIR WATERY FASTNESS ESPOUSED THEM ALL AND WE ARE ASSURED
3879-173592-0013 BEGGED FOR TEN ARQUEBUSIERS TO AID HIM ON A NEW RAID
3879-173592-0014 AGAIN ALLURING HIS GREEDY ALLIES BY THE ASSURANCE THAT THUS REINFORCED HE WOULD CONQUER FOR THEM A FREE ACCESS TO THE PHANTOM GOLD MINES OF APPALACHE OTTIGNY SET FORTH ON THIS FOOL'S ERRAND
3879-173592-0015 WITH THRICE THE FORCE DEMANDED THREE HUNDRED THIRNAGOAS AND THIRTY FRENCHMEN TOOK UP THEIR MARCH THROUGH THE PINE BARRENS OUTINA'S CONJURER WAS OF THE NUMBER AND HAD WELLNIGH RUINED THE ENTERPRISE
3879-173592-0016 WITH HIDEOUS GRIMACES HOWLINGS AND CONTORTIONS HE WROUGHT HIMSELF INTO A PROPHETIC FRENZY AND PROCLAIMED TO THE ASTOUNDED WARRIORS
3879-173592-0017 PANIC SLAUGHTER AND A PLENTIFUL HARVEST OF SCALPS BUT NO PERSUASION COULD INDUCE OUTINA TO FOLLOW UP HIS VICTORY HE WENT HOME TO DANCE ROUND HIS TROPHIES AND THE FRENCH RETURNED DISGUSTED TO FORT CAROLINE
3879-173592-0018 AND NOW IN AMPLE MEASURE THE FRENCH BEGAN TO REAP THE HARVEST OF THEIR FOLLY CONQUEST GOLD AND MILITARY OCCUPATION HAD ALONE BEEN THEIR AIMS
3879-173592-0019 NOT A ROD OF GROUND HAD BEEN STIRRED WITH THE SPADE THEIR STORES WERE CONSUMED AND THE EXPECTED SUPPLIES HAD NOT COME THE INDIANS TOO WERE HOSTILE SATOURIONA HATED THEM AS ALLIES OF HIS ENEMIES
3879-173592-0020 AND HIS TRIBESMEN ROBBED AND MALTREATED BY THE LAWLESS SOLDIERS EXULTED IN THEIR MISERIES YET IN THESE THEIR DARK AND SUBTLE NEIGHBORS WAS THEIR ONLY HOPE MAY DAY CAME
3879-173592-0021 THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THE DAY WHEN RIBAUT AND HIS COMPANIONS FULL OF DELIGHTED ANTICIPATION HAD FIRST EXPLORED
3879-173592-0022 FOR WITHIN THE PRECINCT OF FORT CAROLINE A HOMESICK SQUALID BAND DEJECTED AND WORN DRAGGED THEIR SHRUNKEN LIMBS ABOUT THE SUN SCORCHED AREA OR LAY STRETCHED IN LISTLESS WRETCHEDNESS UNDER THE SHADE OF THE BARRACKS
3879-173592-0023 SOME WERE DIGGING ROOTS IN THE FOREST OR GATHERING A KIND OF SORREL UPON THE MEADOWS IF THEY HAD HAD ANY SKILL IN HUNTING AND FISHING THE RIVER AND THE WOODS WOULD HAVE SUPPLIED THEIR NEEDS BUT IN THIS POINT AS IN OTHERS
3879-173592-0024 THEY WERE LAMENTABLY UNFIT FOR THE WORK THEY HAD TAKEN IN HAND OUR MISERIE SAYS LAUDONNIERE WAS SO GREAT THAT ONE WAS FOUND THAT GATHERED UP ALL THE FISH BONES THAT HE COULD FINDE WHICH HE DRIED
3879-173592-0025 AND BEATE INTO POWDER TO MAKE BREAD THEREOF THE EFFECTS OF THIS HIDEOUS FAMINE APPEARED INCONTINENTLY AMONG US FOR OUR BONES EFTSOONES BEGANNE TO CLEAVE SO NEERE UNTO THE SKINNE
3879-173592-0026 THAT THE MOST PART OF THE SOULDIERS HAD THEIR SKINNES PIERCED THOROW WITH THEM IN MANY PARTES OF THEIR BODIES YET GIDDY WITH WEAKNESS THEY DRAGGED THEMSELVES IN TURN TO THE TOP OF SAINT JOHN'S BLUFF STRAINING THEIR EYES ACROSS THE SEA
3879-173592-0027 TO DESCRY THE ANXIOUSLY EXPECTED SAIL HAD COLIGNY LEFT THEM TO PERISH OR HAD SOME NEW TEMPEST OF CALAMITY LET LOOSE UPON FRANCE DROWNED THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXILE
3879-173592-0028 IN VAIN THE WATCHMAN ON THE HILL SURVEYED THE SOLITUDE OF WATERS A DEEP DEJECTION FELL UPON THEM
3879-173592-0029 COULD THEIR EYES HAVE PIERCED THE FUTURE THE INDIANS HAD LEFT THE NEIGHBORHOOD BUT FROM TIME TO TIME BROUGHT IN MEAGRE SUPPLIES OF FISH WHICH THEY SOLD TO THE FAMISHED SOLDIERS AT EXORBITANT PRICES
3879-173592-0030 LEST THEY SHOULD PAY THE PENALTY OF THEIR EXTORTION THEY WOULD NOT ENTER THE FORT
3879-173592-0031 BEYOND GUNSHOT WAITING FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS TO COME OUT TO THEM OFTENTIMES SAYS LAUDONNIERE OUR POOR SOLDIERS WERE CONSTRAINED TO GIVE AWAY THE VERY SHIRTS FROM THEIR BACKS TO GET ONE FISH IF AT ANY TIME THEY SHEWED UNTO THE SAVAGES
3879-173592-0032 THE EXCESSIVE PRICE WHICH THEY TOOKE THESE VILLAINES WOULD ANSWERE THEM ROUGHLY AND CHURLISHLY IF THOU MAKE SO GREAT ACCOUNT OF THY MARCHANDISE EAT IT AND WE WILL EAT OUR FISH THEN FELL THEY OUT A LAUGHING AND MOCKED US WITH OPEN THROAT
3879-173592-0033 THE SPRING WORE AWAY AND NO RELIEF APPEARED ONE THOUGHT NOW ENGROSSED THE COLONISTS THAT OF RETURN TO FRANCE VASSEUR'S SHIP THE BRETON STILL REMAINED IN THE RIVER
3879-173592-0034 AND THEY HAD ALSO THE SPANISH BRIGANTINE BROUGHT BY THE MUTINEERS BUT THESE VESSELS WERE INSUFFICIENT AND THEY PREPARED TO BUILD A NEW ONE THE ENERGY OF REVIVING HOPE LENT NEW LIFE TO THEIR EXHAUSTED FRAMES
3879-173592-0035 SOME GATHERED PITCH IN THE PINE FORESTS SOME MADE CHARCOAL
3879-173592-0036 THE MAIZE BEGAN TO RIPEN AND THIS BROUGHT SOME RELIEF BUT THE INDIANS EXASPERATED AND GREEDY SOLD IT WITH RELUCTANCE AND MURDERED TWO HALF FAMISHED FRENCHMEN WHO GATHERED A HANDFUL IN THE FIELDS
3879-173592-0037 ONE ASTINA THE PLUNDER OF WHOSE VILLAGES WOULD YIELD AN AMPLE SUPPLY THE OFFER WAS ACCEPTED OTTIGNY AND VASSEUR SET OUT BUT WERE GROSSLY DECEIVED LED AGAINST A DIFFERENT ENEMY
3879-173592-0038 AND SENT BACK EMPTY HANDED AND HALF STARVED THEY RETURNED TO THE FORT IN THE WORDS OF LAUDONNIERE ANGRY AND PRICKED DEEPELY TO THE QUICKE FOR BEING SO MOCKED
3879-173592-0039 AND JOINED BY ALL THEIR COMRADES FIERCELY DEMANDED TO BE LED AGAINST OUTINA TO SEIZE HIM PUNISH HIS INSOLENCE AND EXTORT FROM HIS FEARS THE SUPPLIES WHICH COULD NOT BE LOOKED FOR FROM HIS GRATITUDE THE COMMANDANT WAS FORCED TO COMPLY
3879-173592-0040 THOSE WHO COULD BEAR THE WEIGHT OF THEIR ARMOR PUT IT ON EMBARKED TO THE NUMBER OF FIFTY IN TWO BARGES AND SAILED UP THE RIVER UNDER LAUDONNIERE HIMSELF HAVING REACHED OUTINA'S LANDING THEY MARCHED INLAND ENTERED HIS VILLAGE
3879-173592-0041 SURROUNDED HIS MUD PLASTERED PALACE SEIZED HIM AMID THE YELLS AND HOWLINGS OF HIS SUBJECTS AND LED HIM PRISONER TO THEIR BOATS HERE ANCHORED IN MID STREAM
3879-173592-0042 UTTERED MOANS AND OUTCRIES FROM THE STRAND YET NO RANSOM WAS OFFERED SINCE REASONING FROM THEIR OWN INSTINCTS THEY NEVER DOUBTED THAT AFTER THE PRICE WAS PAID THE CAPTIVE WOULD BE PUT TO DEATH LAUDONNIERE
3879-173592-0043 WAITED TWO DAYS AND THEN DESCENDED THE RIVER WITH HIS PRISONER
3879-174923-0000 THAT HE SHOULD BE ELECTED AND NOW HE DID THINK IT PROBABLE THAT HE SHOULD GET THE SEAT ON A PETITION A SCRUTINY USED TO BE A VERY EXPENSIVE BUSINESS BUT UNDER THE EXISTING LAW MADE AS THE SCRUTINY WOULD BE IN THE BOROUGH ITSELF
3879-174923-0001 IT WOULD COST BUT LITTLE AND THAT LITTLE SHOULD HE BE SUCCESSFUL WOULD FALL ON THE SHOULDERS OF MISTER BROWBOROUGH SHOULD HE KNOCK OFF EIGHT VOTES AND LOSE NONE HIMSELF HE WOULD BE MEMBER FOR TANKERVILLE
3879-174923-0002 HE KNEW THAT MANY VOTES HAD BEEN GIVEN FOR BROWBOROUGH WHICH IF THE TRUTH WERE KNOWN OF THEM WOULD BE KNOCKED OFF AND HE DID NOT KNOW THAT THE SAME COULD BE SAID OF ANY ONE OF THOSE BY WHICH HE HAD BEEN SUPPORTED
3879-174923-0003 BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE JUDGE BY WHOM ALL THIS WOULD BE DECIDED MIGHT NOT REACH TANKERVILLE IN HIS TRAVELS TILL AFTER CHRISTMAS PERHAPS NOT TILL AFTER EASTER AND IN THE MEANTIME WHAT SHOULD HE DO WITH HIMSELF
3879-174923-0004 AS FOR GOING BACK TO DUBLIN THAT WAS NOW OUT OF THE QUESTION HE HAD ENTERED UPON A FEVERISH STATE OF EXISTENCE IN WHICH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD LIVE IN IRELAND
3879-174923-0005 HE MUST VANISH OUT OF THE WORLD
3879-174923-0006 HE WOULD NOT EVEN ENDEAVOUR TO THINK HOW HE MIGHT IN SUCH CASE BEST BESTOW HIMSELF FOR THE PRESENT HE WOULD REMAIN WITHIN THE REGION OF POLITICS AND LIVE AS NEAR AS HE COULD TO THE WHIRL OF THE WHEEL OF WHICH THE SOUND WAS SO DEAR TO HIM
3879-174923-0007 SO YOU'RE AT THE OLD GAME MISTER FINN SAID HIS LANDLORD YES AT THE OLD GAME I SUPPOSE IT'S THE SAME WITH YOU NOW MISTER BUNCE HAD BEEN A VERY VIOLENT POLITICIAN
3879-174923-0008 PRETTY MUCH THE SAME MISTER FINN I DON'T SEE THAT THINGS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THEY USED TO BE THEY TELL ME AT THE PEOPLE'S BANNER OFFICE THAT THE LORDS HAVE HAD AS MUCH TO DO WITH THIS ELECTION AS WITH ANY THAT EVER WENT BEFORE IT
3879-174923-0009 PERHAPS THEY DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT AT THE PEOPLE'S BANNER OFFICE I THOUGHT MISTER SLIDE AND THE PEOPLE'S BANNER HAD GONE OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE BUNCE MISTER SLIDE IS PRETTY WIDE AWAKE WHATEVER SIDE HE'S ON
3879-174923-0010 NOT BUT WHAT HE'S DISGRACED HIMSELF BY WHAT HE'S BEEN AND DONE NOW MISTER SLIDE IN FORMER DAYS HAD BEEN THE EDITOR OF THE PEOPLE'S BANNER
3879-174923-0011 BUT WHAT A MAN KEEPS IN THE WAY OF RELIGION FOR HIS OWN USE IS NEVER NOTHING TO ME AS WHAT I KEEPS IS NOTHING TO HIM I'M AFRAID YOU DON'T KEEP MUCH MISTER BUNCE AND THAT'S NOTHING TO YOU NEITHER IS IT SIR NO INDEED
3879-174923-0012 BUT WHEN WE READ OF CHURCHES AS IS CALLED STATE CHURCHES CHURCHES AS HAVE BISHOPS YOU AND I HAVE TO PAY FOR AS NEVER GOES INTO THEM BUT WE DON'T PAY THE BISHOPS MISTER BUNCE OH YES WE DO BECAUSE IF THEY WASN'T PAID
3879-174923-0013 THE MONEY WOULD COME TO US TO DO AS WE PLEASED WITH IT WE PROVED ALL THAT WHEN WE PARED THEM DOWN A BIT WHAT'S AN ECCLESIASTICAL COMMISSION ONLY ANOTHER NAME FOR A BOX TO PUT THE MONEY INTO TILL YOU WANT TO TAKE IT OUT AGAIN
3879-174923-0014 JUST AS THE THEATRES ARE MISTER FINN OR THE GIN SHOPS THEN I KNOW THERE'S A DEAL MORE TO BE DONE BEFORE HONEST MEN CAN COME BY THEIR OWN YOU'RE RIGHT ENOUGH MISTER FINN YOU ARE AS FAR AS CHURCHES GO AND YOU WAS RIGHT TOO WHEN YOU CUT AND RUN OFF THE TREASURY BENCH
3879-174923-0015 I NEVER EXPECTED THIS BUT I'LL DO FOR YOU MISTER FINN JUST AS I EVER DID IN THE OLD DAYS AND IT WAS I THAT WAS SORRY WHEN I HEARD OF THE POOR YOUNG LADY'S DEATH SO I WAS MISTER FINN WELL THEN I WON'T MENTION HER NAME NEVER AGAIN
3879-174923-0016 BUT AFTER ALL THERE'S BEEN BETWIXT YOU AND US IT WOULDN'T BE NATURAL TO PASS IT BY WITHOUT ONE WORD WOULD IT MISTER FINN WELL YES HE'S JUST THE SAME MAN AS EVER
3879-174923-0017 JUST AS HE USED TO DO AND NEVER GOT SO MUCH OUT OF IT
3879-174923-0018 THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BEAR IT WELL YES THAT IS TRUE MISTER FINN THERE NEVER WAS A MAN BETTER AT BRINGING HOME HIS MONEY TO HIS WIFE THAN BUNCE
3879-174923-0019 IF HE'D DRINK IT WHICH HE NEVER DOES I THINK I'D BEAR IT BETTER THAN GIVE IT TO THAT NASTY UNION AND YOUNG JACK WRITES AS WELL AS HIS FATHER PRETTY NIGH MISTER FINN WHICH IS A COMFORT MISTER BUNCE WAS A JOURNEYMAN SCRIVENER AT A LAW STATIONER'S
3879-174923-0020 AND KEEPS HIS SELF BUT HE DON'T BRING HOME HIS MONEY NOR YET IT CAN'T BE EXPECTED MISTER FINN I KNOW WHAT THE YOUNG UNS WILL DO AND WHAT THEY WON'T AND MARY JANE IS QUITE HANDY ABOUT THE HOUSE NOW ONLY SHE DO BREAK THINGS
3879-174923-0021 WHICH HE USED TO KNOW SO WELL A HUNDRED MEMORIES OF FORMER DAYS CROWDED BACK UPON HIM LORD CHILTERN FOR A FEW MONTHS HAD LIVED WITH HIM AND THEN THERE HAD ARISEN A QUARREL WHICH HE HAD FOR A TIME THOUGHT WOULD DISSOLVE HIS OLD LIFE INTO RUIN
3879-174923-0022 NOW LORD CHILTERN WAS AGAIN HIS VERY INTIMATE FRIEND AND THERE HAD USED TO SIT A NEEDY MONEY LENDER WHOM
3879-174923-0023 ALAS ALAS HOW SOON MIGHT HE NOW REQUIRE THAT MONEY LENDER'S SERVICES AND THEN HE RECOLLECTED HOW HE HAD LEFT THESE ROOMS TO GO INTO OTHERS GRANDER AND MORE APPROPRIATE TO HIS LIFE WHEN HE HAD FILLED HIGH OFFICE UNDER THE STATE
3879-174923-0024 WOULD THERE EVER AGAIN COME TO HIM SUCH CAUSE FOR MIGRATION AND WOULD HE AGAIN BE ABLE TO LOAD THE FRAME OF THE LOOKING GLASS OVER THE FIRE WITH COUNTLESS CARDS FROM COUNTESSES AND MINISTERS WIVES HE HAD OPENED THE OYSTER FOR HIMSELF ONCE
3879-174923-0025 WHEN THE POINT OF HIS KNIFE HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN WOULD HE BE ABLE TO INSERT THE POINT AGAIN BETWEEN THOSE TWO DIFFICULT SHELLS WOULD THE COUNTESSES ONCE MORE BE KIND TO HIM WOULD DRAWING ROOMS BE OPENED TO HIM AND SOMETIMES OPENED TO HIM AND TO NO OTHER
3879-174923-0026 THEN HE THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SPECIAL DRAWING ROOMS IN WHICH WONDERFUL THINGS HAD BEEN SAID TO HIM SINCE THAT HE HAD BEEN A MARRIED MAN AND THOSE SPECIAL DRAWING ROOMS AND THOSE WONDERFUL WORDS HAD IN NO DEGREE ACTUATED HIM IN HIS CHOICE OF A WIFE
3879-174923-0027 HE HAD LEFT ALL THOSE THINGS OF HIS OWN FREE WILL AS THOUGH TELLING HIMSELF THAT THERE WAS A BETTER LIFE THAN THEY OFFERED TO HIM BUT WAS HE SURE THAT HE HAD FOUND IT TO BE BETTER HE HAD CERTAINLY SIGHED FOR THE GAUDS WHICH HE HAD LEFT
3879-174923-0028 WHILE HIS YOUNG WIFE WAS LIVING HE HAD KEPT HIS SIGHS DOWN SO THAT SHE SHOULD NOT HEAR THEM BUT HE HAD BEEN FORCED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HIS NEW LIFE HAD BEEN VAPID AND FLAVOURLESS NOW HE HAD BEEN TEMPTED BACK AGAIN TO THE OLD HAUNTS
3879-174923-0029 WOULD THE COUNTESSES CARDS BE SHOWERED UPON HIM AGAIN ONE CARD OR RATHER NOTE HAD REACHED HIM WHILE HE WAS YET AT TANKERVILLE REMINDING HIM OF OLD DAYS IT WAS FROM MISSUS LOW THE WIFE OF THE BARRISTER
3879-174923-0030 WITH WHOM HE HAD WORKED WHEN HE HAD BEEN A LAW STUDENT IN LONDON SHE HAD ASKED HIM TO COME AND DINE WITH THEM AFTER THE OLD FASHION IN BAKER STREET NAMING A DAY AS TO WHICH SHE PRESUMED THAT HE WOULD BY THAT TIME HAVE FINISHED HIS AFFAIRS AT TANKERVILLE
3879-174923-0031 INTIMATING ALSO THAT MISTER LOW WOULD THEN HAVE FINISHED HIS AT NORTH BROUGHTON NOW MISTER LOW HAD SAT FOR NORTH BROUGHTON BEFORE PHINEAS LEFT LONDON AND HIS WIFE SPOKE OF THE SEAT AS A CERTAINTY
3879-174923-0032 PHINEAS COULD NOT KEEP HIMSELF FROM FEELING THAT MISSUS LOW INTENDED TO TRIUMPH OVER HIM BUT NEVERTHELESS HE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION THEY WERE VERY GLAD TO SEE HIM EXPLAINING THAT
3879-174923-0033 AS NOBODY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN TOWN NOBODY HAD BEEN ASKED TO MEET HIM IN FORMER DAYS HE HAD BEEN VERY INTIMATE IN THAT HOUSE HAVING RECEIVED FROM BOTH OF THEM MUCH KINDNESS MINGLED PERHAPS WITH SOME TOUCH OF SEVERITY ON THE PART OF THE LADY
3879-174923-0034 BUT THE GROUND FOR THAT WAS GONE AND MISSUS LOW WAS NO LONGER PAINFULLY SEVERE A FEW WORDS WERE SAID AS TO HIS GREAT LOSS MISSUS LOW ONCE RAISED HER EYEBROWS IN PRETENDED SURPRISE
3879-174923-0035 WHEN PHINEAS EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD THROWN UP HIS PLACE AND THEN THEY SETTLED DOWN ON THE QUESTION OF THE DAY AND SO SAID MISSUS LOW YOU'VE BEGUN TO ATTACK THE CHURCH IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT AT THIS MOMENT MISTER DAUBENY
3879-174923-0036 AND IF HER HUSBAND COULD NOT BE SAID TO LIVE BY MEANS OF THE SAME ATMOSPHERE IT WAS BECAUSE THE BREATH OF HIS NOSTRILS HAD BEEN DRAWN CHIEFLY IN THE VICE CHANCELLOR'S COURT IN LINCOLN'S INN BUT HE NO DOUBT
3879-174923-0037 WOULD BE VERY MUCH DISTURBED INDEED SHOULD HE EVER BE TOLD THAT HE WAS REQUIRED AS AN EXPECTANT MEMBER OF MISTER DAUBENY'S PARTY TO VOTE FOR THE DISESTABLISHMENT
3879-174923-0038 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT I AM GUILTY OF THROWING THE FIRST STONE SAID PHINEAS THEY HAVE BEEN THROWING STONES AT THE TEMPLE SINCE FIRST IT WAS BUILT SAID MISSUS LOW WITH ENERGY BUT THEY HAVE FALLEN OFF ITS POLISHED SHAFTS IN DUST AND FRAGMENTS
3879-174923-0039 I AM AFRAID THAT MISSUS LOW WHEN SHE ALLOWED HERSELF TO SPEAK THUS ENERGETICALLY ENTERTAINED SOME CONFUSED IDEA THAT THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND AND THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION WERE ONE AND THE SAME THING OR AT LEAST THAT THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE WORLD TOGETHER
3879-174923-0040 YOU HAVEN'T THROWN THE FIRST STONE SAID MISTER LOW BUT YOU HAVE TAKEN UP THE THROWING AT THE FIRST MOMENT IN WHICH STONES MAY BE DANGEROUS NO STONES CAN BE DANGEROUS SAID MISSUS LOW
3879-174923-0041 THE IDEA OF A STATE CHURCH SAID PHINEAS IS OPPOSED TO MY THEORY OF POLITICAL PROGRESS WHAT I HOPE IS THAT MY FRIENDS WILL NOT SUPPOSE THAT I ATTACK THE PROTESTANT CHURCH BECAUSE I AM A ROMAN CATHOLIC IF I WERE A PRIEST
3879-174923-0042 IT WOULD BE MY BUSINESS TO DO SO BUT I AM NOT A PRIEST MISTER LOW GAVE HIS OLD FRIEND A BOTTLE OF HIS BEST WINE AND IN ALL FRIENDLY OBSERVANCES TREATED HIM WITH DUE AFFECTION BUT NEITHER DID HE NOR DID HIS WIFE
3879-174923-0043 FOR A MOMENT ABSTAIN FROM ATTACKING THEIR GUEST IN RESPECT TO HIS SPEECHES AT TANKERVILLE IT SEEMED INDEED TO PHINEAS THAT AS MISSUS LOW WAS BUCKLED UP IN SUCH TRIPLE ARMOUR THAT SHE FEARED NOTHING
3879-174923-0044 SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN LESS LOUD IN EXPRESSING HER ABHORRENCE OF THE ENEMIES OF THE CHURCH IF SHE FEARED NOTHING WHY SHOULD SHE SCREAM SO LOUDLY BETWEEN THE TWO HE WAS A GOOD DEAL CRUSHED AND CONFOUNDED
3879-174923-0045 AND MISSUS LOW WAS VERY TRIUMPHANT WHEN SHE ALLOWED HIM TO ESCAPE FROM HER HANDS AT TEN O'CLOCK BUT AT THAT MOMENT NOTHING HAD AS YET BEEN HEARD IN BAKER STREET OF MISTER DAUBENY'S PROPOSITION TO THE ELECTORS OF EAST BARSETSHIRE
3879-174923-0046 POOR MISSUS LOW WE CAN FORESEE THAT THERE IS MUCH GRIEF IN STORE FOR HER AND SOME ROCKS AHEAD TOO IN THE POLITICAL CAREER OF HER HUSBAND PHINEAS WAS STILL IN LONDON HANGING ABOUT THE CLUBS DOING NOTHING
3879-174923-0047 DISCUSSING MISTER DAUBENY'S WONDERFUL TREACHERY WITH SUCH MEN AS CAME UP TO TOWN AND WAITING FOR THE MEETING OF PARLIAMENT WHEN HE RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM LADY LAURA KENNEDY DRESDEN NOVEMBER EIGHTEENTH
3879-174923-0048 I HAVE HEARD WITH GREAT PLEASURE FROM MY SISTER IN LAW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN STAYING WITH THEM AT HARRINGTON HALL IT SEEMS SO LIKE OLD DAYS THAT YOU AND OSWALD AND VIOLET SHOULD BE TOGETHER SO MUCH MORE NATURAL
3879-174923-0049 THAN THAT YOU SHOULD BE LIVING IN DUBLIN I CANNOT CONCEIVE OF YOU AS LIVING ANY OTHER LIFE THAN THAT OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS DOWNING STREET AND THE CLUBS NOR DO I WISH TO DO SO
3879-174923-0050 AND WHEN I HEAR OF YOU AT HARRINGTON HALL I KNOW THAT YOU ARE ON YOUR WAY TO THE OTHER THINGS DO TELL ME WHAT LIFE IS LIKE WITH OSWALD AND VIOLET OF COURSE HE NEVER WRITES HE IS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO ON MARRYING
3879-174923-0051 ASSUME THAT THEY HAVE AT LAST GOT A PERSON TO DO A DUTY WHICH HAS ALWAYS HITHERTO BEEN NEGLECTED VIOLET DOES WRITE
3879-174923-0052 AS THE WIFE OF A MASTER OF HOUNDS
3879-174923-0053 AS THE ART IS REAL SHE TOLD ME HOW POOR DEAR LADY BALDOCK COMMUNICATED TO YOU HER UNHAPPINESS ABOUT HER DAUGHTER IN A MANNER THAT MADE EVEN ME LAUGH AND WOULD MAKE THOUSANDS LAUGH IN DAYS TO COME WERE IT EVER TO BE PUBLISHED
3879-174923-0054 BUT OF HER INSIDE LIFE OF HER BABY OR OF HER HUSBAND AS A HUSBAND SHE NEVER SAYS A WORD YOU WILL HAVE SEEN IT ALL AND HAVE ENOUGH OF THE FEMININE SIDE OF A MAN'S CHARACTER TO BE ABLE TO TELL ME HOW THEY ARE LIVING
3879-174923-0055 I AM SURE THEY ARE HAPPY TOGETHER BECAUSE VIOLET HAS MORE COMMON SENSE THAN ANY WOMAN I EVER KNEW AND PRAY TELL ME ABOUT THE AFFAIR AT TANKERVILLE MY COUSIN BARRINGTON WRITES ME WORD THAT YOU WILL CERTAINLY GET THE SEAT
3879-174923-0056 HE DECLARES THAT MISTER BROWBOROUGH IS ALMOST DISPOSED NOT TO FIGHT THE BATTLE THOUGH A MAN MORE DISPOSED TO FIGHT NEVER BRIBED AN ELECTOR BUT BARRINGTON SEEMS TO THINK THAT YOU MANAGED AS WELL AS YOU DID BY GETTING OUTSIDE THE TRACES AS HE CALLS IT
3879-174923-0057 WE CERTAINLY DID NOT THINK THAT YOU WOULD COME OUT STRONG AGAINST THE CHURCH
3879-174923-0058 BUT IF IT MUST COME WHY NOT BY YOUR HANDS AS WELL AS BY ANY OTHER IT IS HARDLY POSSIBLE THAT YOU IN YOUR HEART SHOULD LOVE A PROTESTANT ASCENDANT CHURCH BUT AS BARRINGTON SAYS A HORSE WON'T GET OATS
3879-174923-0059 AT HOME AS YOU KNOW NOT ONLY DID HE TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN POLITICS BUT HE WAS ACTIVE ALSO IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS OWN PROPERTY NOW IT SEEMS TO HIM TO BE ALMOST TOO GREAT A TROUBLE TO WRITE A LETTER TO HIS STEWARD
3879-174923-0060 OR TO REMAIN HERE BY MYSELF BUT HE WILL CONSENT TO NEITHER IN TRUTH THE BURDEN OF IDLENESS HAS NOW FALLEN UPON HIM SO HEAVILY THAT HE CANNOT SHAKE IT OFF HE DREADS THAT HE MAY BE CALLED UPON TO DO ANYTHING
3879-174923-0061 TO ME IT IS ALL ONE TRAGEDY I CANNOT BUT THINK OF THINGS AS THEY WERE TWO OR THREE YEARS SINCE MY FATHER AND MY HUSBAND WERE BOTH IN THE CABINET AND YOU YOUNG AS YOU WERE STOOD BUT ONE STEP BELOW IT OSWALD WAS OUT IN THE COLD HE WAS VERY POOR
3879-174923-0062 PAPA THOUGHT ALL EVIL OF HIM VIOLET HAD REFUSED HIM OVER AND OVER AGAIN HE QUARRELLED WITH YOU AND ALL THE WORLD SEEMED AGAINST HIM THEN OF A SUDDEN YOU VANISHED AND WE VANISHED AN INEFFABLE MISERY FELL UPON ME AND UPON MY WRETCHED HUSBAND
3879-174923-0063 ALL OUR GOOD THINGS WENT FROM US AT A BLOW I AND MY POOR FATHER BECAME AS IT WERE OUTCASTS BUT OSWALD SUDDENLY RETRICKED HIS BEAMS AND IS FLAMING IN THE FOREHEAD OF THE MORNING SKY HE I BELIEVE
3879-174923-0064 HE WON HIS WIFE HONESTLY DID HE NOT AND HE HAS EVER BEEN HONEST IT IS MY PRIDE TO THINK I NEVER GAVE HIM UP BUT THE BITTER PART OF MY CUP CONSISTS IN THIS THAT AS HE HAS WON WHAT HE HAS DESERVED SO HAVE WE
3879-174923-0065 I COMPLAIN OF NO INJUSTICE OUR CASTLE WAS BUILT UPON THE SAND WHY SHOULD MISTER KENNEDY HAVE BEEN A CABINET MINISTER AND WHY SHOULD I HAVE BEEN HIS WIFE
3879-174923-0066 THERE IS NO ONE WHOM I CAN ASK TO TELL ME OF HIM THAT HE DID NOT ATTEND DURING THE LAST SESSION I DO KNOW AND WE PRESUME THAT HE HAS NOW ABANDONED HIS SEAT I FEAR THAT HIS HEALTH IS BAD
3879-174923-0067 BY THE GLOOM OF HIS LIFE I SUPPOSE THAT HE LIVES EXCLUSIVELY AT LOUGHLINTER FROM TIME TO TIME I AM IMPLORED BY HIM TO RETURN TO MY DUTY BENEATH HIS ROOF HE GROUNDS HIS DEMAND ON NO AFFECTION OF HIS OWN
3879-174923-0068 ON NO PRESUMPTION THAT ANY AFFECTION CAN REMAIN WITH ME HE SAYS NO WORD OF HAPPINESS HE OFFERS NO COMFORT HE DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO PERSUADE WITH PROMISES OF FUTURE CARE HE MAKES HIS CLAIM SIMPLY ON HOLY WRIT AND ON THE FEELING OF DUTY WHICH
3879-174923-0069 THENCE OUGHT TO WEIGH UPON ME HE HAS NEVER EVEN TOLD ME THAT HE LOVES ME BUT HE IS PERSISTENT IN DECLARING THAT THOSE WHOM GOD HAS JOINED TOGETHER NOTHING HUMAN SHOULD SEPARATE
3879-174923-0070 I HAVE TOLD PAPA THAT I SHOULD ASK YOU AND HE WOULD BE DELIGHTED
3879-174923-0071 TO BE ABLE TO TALK AGAIN TO ONE WHO KNOWS ALL THE ERRORS AND ALL THE EFFORTS OF MY PAST LIFE AS YOU DO DRESDEN IS VERY COLD IN THE WINTER I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER YOU WOULD MIND THAT WE ARE VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT THE ROOMS BUT MY FATHER BEARS THE TEMPERATURE WONDERFULLY WELL
3879-174923-0072 THOUGH HE COMPLAINS IN MARCH WE MOVE DOWN SOUTH FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS DO COME IF YOU CAN MOST SINCERELY YOURS LAURA KENNEDY
39-121914-0000 EMMA WOODHOUSE HANDSOME CLEVER AND RICH WITH A COMFORTABLE HOME AND HAPPY DISPOSITION SEEMED TO UNITE SOME OF THE BEST BLESSINGS OF EXISTENCE
39-121914-0001 VERY FOND OF BOTH DAUGHTERS BUT PARTICULARLY OF EMMA
39-121914-0002 THE REAL EVILS INDEED OF EMMA'S SITUATION WERE THE POWER OF HAVING RATHER TOO MUCH HER OWN WAY AND A DISPOSITION TO THINK A LITTLE TOO WELL OF HERSELF
39-121914-0003 THESE WERE THE DISADVANTAGES WHICH THREATENED ALLOY TO HER MANY ENJOYMENTS THE DANGER HOWEVER WAS AT PRESENT SO UNPERCEIVED
39-121914-0004 SORROW CAME A GENTLE SORROW BUT NOT AT ALL IN THE SHAPE OF ANY DISAGREEABLE CONSCIOUSNESS MISS TAYLOR MARRIED IT WAS MISS TAYLOR'S LOSS WHICH FIRST BROUGHT GRIEF
39-121914-0005 IT WAS ON THE WEDDING DAY OF THIS BELOVED FRIEND THAT EMMA FIRST SAT IN MOURNFUL THOUGHT OF ANY CONTINUANCE THE WEDDING OVER AND THE BRIDE PEOPLE GONE HER FATHER AND HERSELF WERE LEFT TO DINE TOGETHER
39-121914-0006 THE EVENT HAD EVERY PROMISE OF HAPPINESS FOR HER FRIEND MISTER WESTON WAS A MAN OF UNEXCEPTIONABLE CHARACTER EASY FORTUNE SUITABLE AGE AND PLEASANT MANNERS
39-121914-0007 AND THERE WAS SOME SATISFACTION IN CONSIDERING WITH WHAT SELF DENYING GENEROUS FRIENDSHIP SHE HAD ALWAYS WISHED AND PROMOTED THE MATCH BUT IT WAS A BLACK MORNING'S WORK FOR HER
39-121914-0008 THE WANT OF MISS TAYLOR WOULD BE FELT EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY SHE RECALLED HER PAST KINDNESS THE KINDNESS THE AFFECTION OF SIXTEEN YEARS HOW SHE HAD TAUGHT AND HOW SHE HAD PLAYED WITH HER FROM FIVE YEARS OLD
39-121914-0009 HOW SHE HAD DEVOTED ALL HER POWERS
39-121914-0010 AND HOW NURSED HER THROUGH THE VARIOUS ILLNESSES OF CHILDHOOD A LARGE DEBT OF GRATITUDE WAS OWING HERE BUT THE INTERCOURSE OF THE LAST SEVEN YEARS THE EQUAL FOOTING AND PERFECT UNRESERVE
39-121914-0011 WHICH HAD SOON FOLLOWED ISABELLA'S MARRIAGE ON THEIR BEING LEFT TO EACH OTHER WAS YET A DEARER TENDERER RECOLLECTION SHE HAD BEEN A FRIEND AND COMPANION SUCH AS FEW POSSESSED INTELLIGENT
39-121914-0012 WELL INFORMED USEFUL GENTLE KNOWING ALL THE WAYS OF THE FAMILY INTERESTED IN ALL ITS CONCERNS AND PECULIARLY INTERESTED IN HERSELF IN EVERY PLEASURE EVERY SCHEME OF HERS
39-121914-0013 ONLY HALF A MILE FROM THEM AND A MISS TAYLOR IN THE HOUSE AND WITH ALL HER ADVANTAGES NATURAL AND DOMESTIC SHE WAS NOW IN GREAT DANGER OF SUFFERING FROM INTELLECTUAL SOLITUDE SHE DEARLY LOVED HER FATHER BUT HE WAS NO COMPANION FOR HER
39-121914-0014 RATIONAL OR PLAYFUL THE EVIL OF THE ACTUAL DISPARITY IN THEIR AGES AND MISTER WOODHOUSE HAD NOT MARRIED EARLY WAS MUCH INCREASED BY HIS CONSTITUTION AND HABITS
39-121914-0015 FOR HAVING BEEN A VALETUDINARIAN ALL HIS LIFE WITHOUT ACTIVITY OF MIND OR BODY
39-121914-0016 AND THOUGH EVERYWHERE BELOVED FOR THE FRIENDLINESS OF HIS HEART AND HIS AMIABLE TEMPER HIS TALENTS COULD NOT HAVE RECOMMENDED HIM AT ANY TIME HER SISTER THOUGH COMPARATIVELY BUT LITTLE REMOVED BY MATRIMONY
39-121914-0017 BEING SETTLED IN LONDON ONLY SIXTEEN MILES OFF WAS MUCH BEYOND HER DAILY REACH
39-121914-0018 THROUGH AT HARTFIELD BEFORE CHRISTMAS BROUGHT THE NEXT VISIT FROM ISABELLA AND HER HUSBAND
39-121914-0019 BUT NOT ONE AMONG THEM WHO COULD BE ACCEPTED IN LIEU OF MISS TAYLOR FOR EVEN HALF A DAY IT WAS A MELANCHOLY CHANGE AND EMMA COULD NOT BUT SIGH OVER IT AND WISH FOR IMPOSSIBLE THINGS TILL HER FATHER AWOKE
39-121914-0020 MATRIMONY AS THE ORIGIN OF CHANGE WAS ALWAYS DISAGREEABLE AND HE WAS BY NO MEANS YET RECONCILED TO HIS OWN DAUGHTER'S MARRYING NOR COULD EVER SPEAK OF HER BUT WITH COMPASSION THOUGH IT HAD BEEN ENTIRELY A MATCH OF AFFECTION
39-121914-0021 WHEN HE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO PART WITH MISS TAYLOR TOO AND FROM HIS HABITS OF GENTLE SELFISHNESS AND OF BEING NEVER ABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD FEEL DIFFERENTLY FROM HIMSELF HE WAS VERY MUCH DISPOSED TO THINK MISS TAYLOR HAD DONE
39-121914-0022 AS SAD A THING FOR HERSELF AS FOR THEM AND WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT DEAL HAPPIER IF SHE HAD SPENT ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE AT HARTFIELD EMMA SMILED AND CHATTED AS CHEERFULLY AS SHE COULD TO KEEP HIM FROM SUCH THOUGHTS
39-121914-0023 BUT WHEN TEA CAME IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM NOT TO SAY EXACTLY AS HE HAD SAID AT DINNER POOR MISS TAYLOR I WISH SHE WERE HERE AGAIN WHAT A PITY IT IS THAT MISTER WESTON EVER THOUGHT OF HER
39-121914-0024 AND BEAR ALL MY ODD HUMOURS WHEN SHE MIGHT HAVE A HOUSE OF HER OWN A HOUSE OF HER OWN BUT WHERE IS THE ADVANTAGE OF A HOUSE OF HER OWN THIS IS THREE TIMES AS LARGE AND YOU HAVE NEVER ANY ODD HUMOURS MY DEAR
39-121914-0025 YOU KNOW WE HAVE SETTLED ALL THAT ALREADY
39-121914-0026 THAT WAS YOUR DOING PAPA YOU GOT HANNAH THAT GOOD PLACE NOBODY THOUGHT OF HANNAH TILL YOU MENTIONED HER JAMES IS SO OBLIGED TO YOU I AM VERY GLAD I DID THINK OF HER
39-121914-0027 I AM SURE SHE WILL BE AN EXCELLENT SERVANT
39-121914-0028 HE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL HER HOW WE ALL ARE EMMA SPARED NO EXERTIONS TO MAINTAIN THIS HAPPIER FLOW OF IDEAS AND HOPED BY THE HELP OF BACKGAMMON TO GET HER FATHER TOLERABLY THROUGH THE EVENING
39-121914-0029 AND BE ATTACKED BY NO REGRETS BUT HER OWN THE BACKGAMMON TABLE WAS PLACED BUT A VISITOR IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS WALKED IN AND MADE IT UNNECESSARY MISTER KNIGHTLEY A SENSIBLE MAN ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT AND THIRTY
39-121914-0030 WAS NOT ONLY A VERY OLD AND INTIMATE FRIEND OF THE FAMILY BUT PARTICULARLY CONNECTED WITH IT AS THE ELDER BROTHER OF ISABELLA'S HUSBAND HE LIVED ABOUT A MILE FROM HIGHBURY
39-121914-0031 WAS A FREQUENT VISITOR AND ALWAYS WELCOME AND AT THIS TIME MORE WELCOME THAN USUAL AS COMING DIRECTLY FROM THEIR MUTUAL CONNEXIONS IN LONDON HE HAD RETURNED TO A LATE DINNER
39-121914-0032 MISTER KNIGHTLEY HAD A CHEERFUL MANNER WHICH ALWAYS DID HIM GOOD AND HIS MANY INQUIRIES AFTER POOR ISABELLA AND HER CHILDREN WERE ANSWERED MOST SATISFACTORILY WHEN THIS WAS OVER MISTER WOODHOUSE GRATEFULLY OBSERVED
39-121914-0033 I WISH YOU MAY NOT CATCH COLD DIRTY SIR LOOK AT MY SHOES NOT A SPECK ON THEM
39-121914-0034 I HAVE BEEN IN NO HURRY WITH MY CONGRATULATIONS BUT I HOPE IT ALL WENT OFF TOLERABLY WELL HOW DID YOU ALL BEHAVE WHO CRIED MOST AH POOR MISS TAYLOR TIS A SAD BUSINESS
39-121914-0035 POOR MISTER AND MISS WOODHOUSE IF YOU PLEASE BUT I CANNOT POSSIBLY SAY POOR MISS TAYLOR I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR YOU AND EMMA BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE QUESTION OF DEPENDENCE OR INDEPENDENCE AT ANY RATE
39-121914-0036 IT MUST BE BETTER TO HAVE ONLY ONE TO PLEASE THAN TWO ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE OF THOSE TWO IS SUCH A FANCIFUL TROUBLESOME CREATURE
39-121914-0037 I AM AFRAID I AM SOMETIMES VERY FANCIFUL AND TROUBLESOME MY DEAREST PAPA
39-121914-0038 WHAT A HORRIBLE IDEA OH NO I MEANT ONLY MYSELF MISTER KNIGHTLEY LOVES TO FIND FAULT WITH ME YOU KNOW IN A JOKE IT IS ALL A JOKE
39-121914-0039 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT EMMA SHOULD NOT MISS SUCH A COMPANION SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY WE SHOULD NOT LIKE HER SO WELL AS WE DO SIR IF WE COULD SUPPOSE IT BUT SHE KNOWS HOW MUCH THE MARRIAGE IS TO MISS TAYLOR'S ADVANTAGE
39-121914-0040 SHE KNOWS HOW VERY ACCEPTABLE IT MUST BE AT MISS TAYLOR'S TIME OF LIFE TO BE SETTLED IN A HOME OF HER OWN AND HOW IMPORTANT TO HER TO BE SECURE OF A COMFORTABLE PROVISION
39-121914-0041 AND A VERY CONSIDERABLE ONE THAT I MADE THE MATCH MYSELF I MADE THE MATCH YOU KNOW FOUR YEARS AGO AND TO HAVE IT TAKE PLACE AND BE PROVED IN THE RIGHT
39-121914-0042 MAY COMFORT ME FOR ANY THING MISTER KNIGHTLEY SHOOK HIS HEAD AT HER HER FATHER FONDLY REPLIED AH MY DEAR I WISH YOU WOULD NOT MAKE MATCHES AND FORETELL THINGS FOR WHATEVER YOU SAY ALWAYS COMES TO PASS
39-121914-0043 AND WHO SEEMED SO PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE WITHOUT A WIFE SO CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED EITHER IN HIS BUSINESS IN TOWN OR AMONG HIS FRIENDS HERE ALWAYS ACCEPTABLE WHEREVER HE WENT ALWAYS CHEERFUL
39-121914-0044 MISTER WESTON NEED NOT SPEND A SINGLE EVENING IN THE YEAR ALONE IF HE DID NOT LIKE IT OH NO MISTER WESTON CERTAINLY WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN SOME PEOPLE EVEN TALKED OF A PROMISE TO HIS WIFE ON HER DEATHBED
39-121914-0045 AND OTHERS OF THE SON AND THE UNCLE NOT LETTING HIM ALL MANNER OF SOLEMN NONSENSE WAS TALKED ON THE SUBJECT BUT I BELIEVED NONE OF IT EVER SINCE THE DAY ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO
39-121914-0046 AND BORROWED TWO UMBRELLAS FOR US FROM FARMER MITCHELL'S I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT I PLANNED THE MATCH FROM THAT HOUR AND WHEN SUCH SUCCESS HAS BLESSED ME IN THIS INSTANCE DEAR PAPA
39-121914-0047 IF YOU HAVE BEEN ENDEAVOURING FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS TO BRING ABOUT THIS MARRIAGE A WORTHY EMPLOYMENT FOR A YOUNG LADY'S MIND
39-121914-0048 YOUR MAKING THE MATCH AS YOU CALL IT MEANS ONLY YOUR PLANNING IT YOUR SAYING TO YOURSELF ONE IDLE DAY I THINK IT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD THING FOR MISS TAYLOR IF MISTER WESTON WERE TO MARRY HER
39-121914-0049 AND HAVE YOU NEVER KNOWN THE PLEASURE AND TRIUMPH OF A LUCKY GUESS I PITY YOU I THOUGHT YOU CLEVERER FOR DEPEND UPON IT A LUCKY GUESS IS NEVER MERELY LUCK THERE IS ALWAYS SOME TALENT IN IT
39-121914-0050 AND A RATIONAL UNAFFECTED WOMAN LIKE MISS TAYLOR MAY BE SAFELY LEFT TO MANAGE THEIR OWN CONCERNS YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE DONE HARM TO YOURSELF THAN GOOD TO THEM BY INTERFERENCE
39-121914-0051 UNDERSTANDING BUT IN PART BUT MY DEAR PRAY DO NOT MAKE ANY MORE MATCHES THEY ARE SILLY THINGS AND BREAK UP ONE'S FAMILY CIRCLE GRIEVOUSLY
39-121914-0052 POOR MISTER ELTON YOU LIKE MISTER ELTON PAPA I MUST LOOK ABOUT FOR A WIFE FOR HIM THERE IS NOBODY IN HIGHBURY WHO DESERVES HIM AND HE HAS BEEN HERE A WHOLE YEAR AND HAS FITTED UP HIS HOUSE SO COMFORTABLY
39-121914-0053 THAT IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO HAVE HIM SINGLE ANY LONGER AND I THOUGHT WHEN HE WAS JOINING THEIR HANDS TO DAY HE LOOKED SO VERY MUCH AS IF HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE SAME KIND OFFICE DONE FOR HIM I THINK VERY WELL OF MISTER ELTON
39-121914-0054 AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I HAVE OF DOING HIM A SERVICE MISTER ELTON IS A VERY PRETTY YOUNG MAN TO BE SURE AND A VERY GOOD YOUNG MAN AND I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR HIM BUT IF YOU WANT TO SHEW HIM ANY ATTENTION MY DEAR
39-121914-0055 ASK HIM TO COME AND DINE WITH US SOME DAY
39-121914-0056 I DARE SAY MISTER KNIGHTLEY WILL BE SO KIND AS TO MEET HIM
39-121915-0000 BUT ON SUCCEEDING EARLY IN LIFE TO A SMALL INDEPENDENCE HAD BECOME INDISPOSED FOR ANY OF THE MORE HOMELY PURSUITS IN WHICH HIS BROTHERS WERE ENGAGED AND HAD SATISFIED AN ACTIVE CHEERFUL MIND
39-121915-0001 AND SOCIAL TEMPER BY ENTERING INTO THE MILITIA OF HIS COUNTY THEN EMBODIED CAPTAIN WESTON WAS A GENERAL FAVOURITE AND WHEN THE CHANCES OF HIS MILITARY LIFE HAD INTRODUCED HIM TO MISS CHURCHILL OF A GREAT YORKSHIRE FAMILY
39-121915-0002 AND MISS CHURCHILL FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM NOBODY WAS SURPRIZED EXCEPT HER BROTHER AND HIS WIFE WHO HAD NEVER SEEN HIM AND WHO WERE FULL OF PRIDE AND IMPORTANCE WHICH THE CONNEXION WOULD OFFEND
39-121915-0003 MISS CHURCHILL HOWEVER BEING OF AGE AND WITH THE FULL COMMAND OF HER FORTUNE THOUGH HER FORTUNE BORE NO PROPORTION TO THE FAMILY ESTATE
39-121915-0004 AND IT TOOK PLACE TO THE INFINITE MORTIFICATION OF MISTER AND MISSUS CHURCHILL
39-121915-0005 MISSUS WESTON OUGHT TO HAVE FOUND MORE IN IT FOR SHE HAD A HUSBAND WHOSE WARM HEART AND SWEET TEMPER MADE HIM THINK EVERY THING DUE TO HER IN RETURN FOR THE GREAT GOODNESS OF BEING IN LOVE WITH HIM BUT THOUGH SHE HAD ONE SORT OF SPIRIT
39-121915-0006 SHE HAD NOT THE BEST SHE HAD RESOLUTION ENOUGH TO PURSUE HER OWN WILL IN SPITE OF HER BROTHER BUT NOT ENOUGH TO REFRAIN FROM UNREASONABLE REGRETS AT THAT BROTHER'S UNREASONABLE ANGER
39-121915-0007 NOR FROM MISSING THE LUXURIES OF HER FORMER HOME
39-121915-0008 SHE DID NOT CEASE TO LOVE HER HUSBAND BUT SHE WANTED AT ONCE TO BE THE WIFE OF CAPTAIN WESTON AND MISS CHURCHILL OF ENSCOMBE CAPTAIN WESTON WHO HAD BEEN CONSIDERED
39-121915-0009 AND MISTER AND MISSUS CHURCHILL HAVING NO CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN NOR ANY OTHER YOUNG CREATURE OF EQUAL KINDRED TO CARE FOR OFFERED TO TAKE THE WHOLE CHARGE OF THE LITTLE FRANK SOON AFTER HER DECEASE
39-121915-0010 AND HE HAD ONLY HIS OWN COMFORT TO SEEK AND HIS OWN SITUATION TO IMPROVE AS HE COULD A COMPLETE CHANGE OF LIFE BECAME DESIRABLE HE QUITTED THE MILITIA AND ENGAGED IN TRADE
39-121915-0011 HAVING BROTHERS ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN A GOOD WAY IN LONDON WHICH AFFORDED HIM A FAVOURABLE OPENING IT WAS A CONCERN WHICH BROUGHT JUST EMPLOYMENT ENOUGH HE HAD STILL A SMALL HOUSE IN HIGHBURY
39-121915-0012 WHERE MOST OF HIS LEISURE DAYS WERE SPENT AND BETWEEN USEFUL OCCUPATION AND THE PLEASURES OF SOCIETY THE NEXT EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS OF HIS LIFE PASSED CHEERFULLY AWAY HE HAD BY THAT TIME REALISED AN EASY COMPETENCE
39-121915-0013 ENOUGH TO SECURE THE PURCHASE OF A LITTLE ESTATE ADJOINING HIGHBURY WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS LONGED FOR ENOUGH TO MARRY A WOMAN AS PORTIONLESS EVEN AS MISS TAYLOR
39-121915-0014 AND TO LIVE ACCORDING TO THE WISHES OF HIS OWN FRIENDLY AND SOCIAL DISPOSITION IT WAS NOW SOME TIME SINCE MISS TAYLOR HAD BEGUN TO INFLUENCE HIS SCHEMES BUT AS IT WAS NOT THE TYRANNIC INFLUENCE OF YOUTH ON YOUTH
39-121915-0015 TILL THEY WERE ACCOMPLISHED HE HAD MADE HIS FORTUNE BOUGHT HIS HOUSE AND OBTAINED HIS WIFE AND WAS BEGINNING A NEW PERIOD OF EXISTENCE WITH EVERY PROBABILITY OF GREATER HAPPINESS THAN IN ANY YET PASSED THROUGH
39-121915-0016 HE HAD NEVER BEEN AN UNHAPPY MAN HIS OWN TEMPER HAD SECURED HIM FROM THAT EVEN IN HIS FIRST MARRIAGE BUT HIS SECOND MUST SHEW HIM HOW DELIGHTFUL A WELL JUDGING AND TRULY AMIABLE WOMAN COULD BE
39-121915-0017 ON COMING OF AGE IT WAS MOST UNLIKELY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD EVER WANT HIS FATHER'S ASSISTANCE HIS FATHER HAD NO APPREHENSION OF IT THE AUNT WAS A CAPRICIOUS WOMAN AND GOVERNED HER HUSBAND ENTIRELY
39-121915-0018 BUT IT WAS NOT IN MISTER WESTON'S NATURE TO IMAGINE THAT ANY CAPRICE COULD BE STRONG ENOUGH TO AFFECT ONE SO DEAR AND AS HE BELIEVED SO DESERVEDLY DEAR HE SAW HIS SON EVERY YEAR IN LONDON AND WAS PROUD OF HIM
39-121915-0019 MISTER FRANK CHURCHILL WAS ONE OF THE BOASTS OF HIGHBURY AND A LIVELY CURIOSITY TO SEE HIM PREVAILED
39-121915-0020 BUT NEVER ACHIEVED NOW UPON HIS FATHER'S MARRIAGE IT WAS VERY GENERALLY PROPOSED AS A MOST PROPER ATTENTION
39-121915-0021 EITHER WHEN MISSUS PERRY DRANK TEA WITH MISSUS AND MISS BATES OR WHEN MISSUS AND MISS BATES RETURNED THE VISIT NOW WAS THE TIME FOR MISTER FRANK CHURCHILL TO COME AMONG THEM AND THE HOPE STRENGTHENED
39-121915-0022 WHEN IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD WRITTEN TO HIS NEW MOTHER ON THE OCCASION FOR A FEW DAYS EVERY MORNING VISIT IN HIGHBURY INCLUDED SOME MENTION OF THE HANDSOME LETTER MISSUS WESTON HAD RECEIVED
39-121915-0023 I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE HANDSOME LETTER MISTER FRANK CHURCHILL HAS WRITTEN TO MISSUS WESTON
39-121915-0024 MISSUS WESTON HAD OF COURSE FORMED A VERY FAVOURABLE IDEA OF THE YOUNG MAN AND SUCH A PLEASING ATTENTION WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE PROOF OF HIS GREAT GOOD SENSE
39-121915-0025 AND EVERY EXPRESSION OF CONGRATULATION WHICH HER MARRIAGE HAD ALREADY SECURED SHE FELT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE WOMAN AND SHE HAD LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW HOW FORTUNATE SHE MIGHT WELL BE THOUGHT
39-121915-0026 BUT DEAR EMMA WAS OF NO FEEBLE CHARACTER
39-121915-0027 AND HAD SENSE AND ENERGY AND SPIRITS THAT MIGHT BE HOPED WOULD BEAR HER WELL AND HAPPILY THROUGH ITS LITTLE DIFFICULTIES AND PRIVATIONS AND THEN THERE WAS SUCH COMFORT IN THE VERY EASY DISTANCE OF RANDALLS FROM HARTFIELD
39-121915-0028 HER SITUATION WAS ALTOGETHER THE SUBJECT OF HOURS OF GRATITUDE TO MISSUS WESTON AND OF MOMENTS ONLY OF REGRET AND HER SATISFACTION HER MORE THAN SATISFACTION HER CHEERFUL ENJOYMENT WAS SO JUST
39-121915-0029 AND SO APPARENT THAT EMMA WELL AS SHE KNEW HER FATHER WAS SOMETIMES TAKEN BY SURPRIZE
39-121915-0030 TAYLOR WHEN THEY LEFT HER AT RANDALLS IN THE CENTRE OF EVERY DOMESTIC COMFORT OR SAW HER GO AWAY IN THE EVENING ATTENDED BY HER PLEASANT HUSBAND TO A CARRIAGE OF HER OWN
39-121915-0031 BUT NEVER DID SHE GO WITHOUT MISTER WOODHOUSE'S GIVING A GENTLE SIGH AND SAYING AH POOR MISS TAYLOR SHE WOULD BE VERY GLAD TO STAY
39-121915-0032 THERE WAS NO RECOVERING MISS TAYLOR NOR MUCH LIKELIHOOD OF CEASING TO PITY HER BUT A FEW WEEKS BROUGHT SOME ALLEVIATION TO MISTER WOODHOUSE THE COMPLIMENTS OF HIS NEIGHBOURS WERE OVER
39-121915-0033 BUT STILL THE CAKE WAS EATEN AND THERE WAS NO REST FOR HIS BENEVOLENT NERVES TILL IT WAS ALL GONE
39-121916-0000 MISTER WOODHOUSE WAS FOND OF SOCIETY IN HIS OWN WAY HE LIKED VERY MUCH TO HAVE HIS FRIENDS COME AND SEE HIM AND FROM VARIOUS UNITED CAUSES FROM HIS LONG RESIDENCE AT HARTFIELD AND HIS GOOD NATURE FROM HIS FORTUNE HIS HOUSE AND HIS DAUGHTER
39-121916-0001 HE COULD COMMAND THE VISITS OF HIS OWN LITTLE CIRCLE IN A GREAT MEASURE AS HE LIKED HE HAD NOT MUCH INTERCOURSE WITH ANY FAMILIES BEYOND THAT CIRCLE HIS HORROR OF LATE HOURS AND LARGE DINNER PARTIES
39-121916-0002 AND UNLESS HE FANCIED HIMSELF AT ANY TIME UNEQUAL TO COMPANY THERE WAS SCARCELY AN EVENING IN THE WEEK IN WHICH EMMA COULD NOT MAKE UP A CARD TABLE FOR HIM REAL LONG STANDING REGARD BROUGHT THE WESTONS AND MISTER KNIGHTLEY
39-121916-0003 AND BY MISTER ELTON A YOUNG MAN LIVING ALONE WITHOUT LIKING IT THE PRIVILEGE OF EXCHANGING ANY VACANT EVENING OF HIS OWN BLANK SOLITUDE FOR THE ELEGANCIES AND SOCIETY OF MISTER WOODHOUSE'S DRAWING ROOM
39-121916-0004 AND MISSUS GODDARD THREE LADIES ALMOST ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF AN INVITATION FROM HARTFIELD AND WHO WERE FETCHED AND CARRIED HOME SO OFTEN THAT MISTER WOODHOUSE THOUGHT IT NO HARDSHIP FOR EITHER JAMES OR THE HORSES
39-121916-0005 FOR A WOMAN NEITHER YOUNG HANDSOME RICH NOR MARRIED MISS BATES STOOD IN THE VERY WORST PREDICAMENT IN THE WORLD FOR HAVING MUCH OF THE PUBLIC FAVOUR AND SHE HAD NO INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY TO MAKE ATONEMENT TO HERSELF
39-121916-0006 SHE LOVED EVERY BODY WAS INTERESTED IN EVERY BODY'S HAPPINESS QUICKSIGHTED TO EVERY BODY'S MERITS THOUGHT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE CREATURE AND SURROUNDED WITH BLESSINGS IN SUCH AN EXCELLENT MOTHER
39-121916-0007 AND SO MANY GOOD NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS AND A HOME THAT WANTED FOR NOTHING THE SIMPLICITY AND CHEERFULNESS OF HER NATURE HER CONTENTED AND GRATEFUL SPIRIT WERE A RECOMMENDATION TO EVERY BODY
39-121916-0008 AND A MINE OF FELICITY TO HERSELF SHE WAS A GREAT TALKER UPON LITTLE MATTERS WHICH EXACTLY SUITED MISTER WOODHOUSE FULL OF TRIVIAL COMMUNICATIONS AND HARMLESS GOSSIP MISSUS GODDARD WAS THE MISTRESS OF A SCHOOL
39-121916-0009 AND WHERE YOUNG LADIES FOR ENORMOUS PAY MIGHT BE SCREWED OUT OF HEALTH AND INTO VANITY BUT A REAL HONEST OLD FASHIONED BOARDING SCHOOL WHERE A REASONABLE QUANTITY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE SOLD AT A REASONABLE PRICE
39-121916-0010 FOR HIGHBURY WAS RECKONED A PARTICULARLY HEALTHY SPOT SHE HAD AN AMPLE HOUSE AND GARDEN GAVE THE CHILDREN PLENTY OF WHOLESOME FOOD LET THEM RUN ABOUT A GREAT DEAL IN THE SUMMER
39-121916-0011 HUNG ROUND WITH FANCY WORK WHENEVER SHE COULD AND WIN OR LOSE A FEW SIXPENCES BY HIS FIRESIDE THESE WERE THE LADIES WHOM EMMA FOUND HERSELF VERY FREQUENTLY ABLE TO COLLECT
39-121916-0012 IT WAS NO REMEDY FOR THE ABSENCE OF MISSUS WESTON SHE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE HER FATHER LOOK COMFORTABLE AND VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH HERSELF FOR CONTRIVING THINGS SO WELL
39-121916-0013 BUT THE QUIET PROSINGS OF THREE SUCH WOMEN MADE HER FEEL THAT EVERY EVENING SO SPENT WAS INDEED ONE OF THE LONG EVENINGS SHE HAD FEARFULLY ANTICIPATED AS SHE SAT ONE MORNING LOOKING FORWARD TO EXACTLY SUCH A CLOSE OF THE PRESENT DAY
39-121916-0014 TO BE ALLOWED TO BRING MISS SMITH WITH HER A MOST WELCOME REQUEST FOR MISS SMITH WAS A GIRL OF SEVENTEEN WHOM EMMA KNEW VERY WELL BY SIGHT AND HAD LONG FELT AN INTEREST IN ON ACCOUNT OF HER BEAUTY
39-121916-0015 A VERY GRACIOUS INVITATION WAS RETURNED AND THE EVENING NO LONGER DREADED BY THE FAIR MISTRESS OF THE MANSION HARRIET SMITH WAS THE NATURAL DAUGHTER OF SOMEBODY SOMEBODY HAD PLACED HER SEVERAL YEARS BACK AT MISSUS GODDARD'S SCHOOL
39-121916-0016 SHE WAS SHORT PLUMP AND FAIR WITH A FINE BLOOM BLUE EYES LIGHT HAIR REGULAR FEATURES AND A LOOK OF GREAT SWEETNESS AND BEFORE THE END OF THE EVENING EMMA WAS AS MUCH PLEASED WITH HER MANNERS AS HER PERSON
39-121916-0017 AND QUITE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE WAS NOT STRUCK BY ANY THING REMARKABLY CLEVER IN MISS SMITH'S CONVERSATION BUT SHE FOUND HER ALTOGETHER VERY ENGAGING NOT INCONVENIENTLY SHY
39-121916-0018 NOT UNWILLING TO TALK AND YET SO FAR FROM PUSHING SHEWING SO PROPER AND BECOMING A DEFERENCE SEEMING SO PLEASANTLY GRATEFUL FOR BEING ADMITTED TO HARTFIELD
39-121916-0019 AND SO ARTLESSLY IMPRESSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF EVERY THING IN SO SUPERIOR A STYLE TO WHAT SHE HAD BEEN USED TO THAT SHE MUST HAVE GOOD SENSE AND DESERVE ENCOURAGEMENT ENCOURAGEMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN
39-121916-0020 THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES AND ALL THOSE NATURAL GRACES SHOULD NOT BE WASTED ON THE INFERIOR SOCIETY OF HIGHBURY AND ITS CONNEXIONS THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE HAD ALREADY FORMED WERE UNWORTHY OF HER
39-121916-0021 SHE WOULD FORM HER OPINIONS AND HER MANNERS IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING AND CERTAINLY A VERY KIND UNDERTAKING HIGHLY BECOMING HER OWN SITUATION IN LIFE HER LEISURE AND POWERS
39-121916-0022 SHE WAS SO BUSY IN ADMIRING THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES IN TALKING AND LISTENING AND FORMING ALL THESE SCHEMES IN THE IN BETWEENS THAT THE EVENING FLEW AWAY AT A VERY UNUSUAL RATE AND THE SUPPER TABLE WHICH
39-121916-0023 ALWAYS CLOSED SUCH PARTIES AND FOR WHICH SHE HAD BEEN USED TO SIT AND WATCH THE DUE TIME WAS ALL SET OUT AND READY AND MOVED FORWARDS TO THE FIRE BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE WITH AN ALACRITY BEYOND THE COMMON IMPULSE OF A SPIRIT
39-121916-0024 WHICH YET WAS NEVER INDIFFERENT TO THE CREDIT OF DOING EVERY THING WELL AND ATTENTIVELY WITH THE REAL GOOD WILL OF A MIND DELIGHTED WITH ITS OWN IDEAS DID SHE THEN DO ALL THE HONOURS OF THE MEAL
39-121916-0025 HE LOVED TO HAVE THE CLOTH LAID
39-121916-0026 AND WHILE HIS HOSPITALITY WOULD HAVE WELCOMED HIS VISITORS TO EVERY THING
39-121916-0027 SUCH ANOTHER SMALL BASIN OF THIN GRUEL AS HIS OWN WAS ALL THAT HE COULD WITH THOROUGH SELF APPROBATION RECOMMEND THOUGH HE MIGHT CONSTRAIN HIMSELF WHILE THE LADIES WERE COMFORTABLY CLEARING THE NICER THINGS TO SAY
39-121916-0028 MISSUS BATES LET ME PROPOSE YOUR VENTURING ON ONE OF THESE EGGS AN EGG BOILED VERY SOFT IS NOT UNWHOLESOME
39-121916-0029 I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AN EGG BOILED BY ANY BODY ELSE BUT YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID THEY ARE VERY SMALL YOU SEE ONE OF OUR SMALL EGGS WILL NOT HURT YOU
39-121916-0030 WHAT SAY YOU TO HALF A GLASS OF WINE A SMALL HALF GLASS PUT INTO A TUMBLER OF WATER I DO NOT THINK IT COULD DISAGREE WITH YOU EMMA ALLOWED HER FATHER TO TALK BUT SUPPLIED HER VISITORS IN A MUCH MORE SATISFACTORY STYLE
39-121916-0031 AND ON THE PRESENT EVENING HAD PARTICULAR PLEASURE IN SENDING THEM AWAY HAPPY
3947-13260-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN NO ONE IN ALL RAYMOND INCLUDING THE RECTANGLE FELT LOREEN'S DEATH MORE KEENLY THAN VIRGINIA IT CAME LIKE A DISTINCT PERSONAL LOSS TO HER
3947-13260-0001 THAT SHORT WEEK WHILE THE GIRL HAD BEEN IN HER HOME HAD OPENED VIRGINIA'S HEART TO A NEW LIFE SHE WAS TALKING IT OVER WITH RACHEL THE DAY AFTER THE FUNERAL
3947-13260-0002 I AM GOING TO DO SOMETHING WITH MY MONEY TO HELP THOSE WOMEN TO A BETTER LIFE VIRGINIA LOOKED OVER TO THE END OF THE HALL WHERE THE DAY BEFORE LOREEN'S BODY HAD LAIN I HAVE DECIDED ON A GOOD PLAN AS IT SEEMS TO ME
3947-13260-0003 I HAVE TALKED IT OVER WITH ROLLIN HE WILL DEVOTE A LARGE PART OF HIS MONEY ALSO TO THE SAME PLAN HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE YOU VIRGINIA TO GIVE IN THIS WAY ASKED RACHEL ONCE SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE ASKED SUCH A PERSONAL QUESTION
3947-13260-0004 NOW IT SEEMED AS NATURAL TO TALK FRANKLY ABOUT MONEY AS ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE THAT BELONGED TO GOD I HAVE AVAILABLE FOR USE AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ROLLIN HAS AS MUCH MORE
3947-13260-0005 IT IS ONE OF HIS BITTER REGRETS NOW THAT HIS EXTRAVAGANT HABITS OF LIFE BEFORE HIS CONVERSION PRACTICALLY THREW AWAY HALF THAT FATHER LEFT HIM WE ARE BOTH EAGER TO MAKE ALL THE REPARATION IN OUR POWER WHAT WOULD JESUS DO WITH THIS MONEY
3947-13260-0006 WE WANT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION HONESTLY AND WISELY THE MONEY I SHALL PUT INTO THE NEWS IS I AM CONFIDENT IN A LINE WITH HIS PROBABLE ACTION
3947-13260-0007 IT IS AS NECESSARY THAT WE HAVE A CHRISTIAN DAILY PAPER IN RAYMOND ESPECIALLY NOW THAT WE HAVE THE SALOON INFLUENCE TO MEET AS IT IS TO HAVE A CHURCH OR A COLLEGE SO I AM SATISFIED THAT THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT MISTER NORMAN WILL KNOW HOW TO USE SO WELL
3947-13260-0008 WILL BE A POWERFUL FACTOR IN RAYMOND TO DO AS JESUS WOULD ABOUT MY OTHER PLAN RACHEL I WANT YOU TO WORK WITH ME
3947-13260-0009 THE FIELD WHERE THE TENT NOW IS HAS BEEN IN LITIGATION FOR YEARS WE MEAN TO SECURE THE ENTIRE TRACT AS SOON AS THE COURTS HAVE SETTLED THE TITLE FOR SOME TIME I HAVE BEEN MAKING A SPECIAL STUDY OF THE VARIOUS FORMS OF COLLEGE SETTLEMENTS AND RESIDENCE METHODS
3947-13260-0010 OF CHRISTIAN WORK AND INSTITUTIONAL CHURCH WORK IN THE HEART OF GREAT CITY SLUMS I DO NOT KNOW THAT I HAVE YET BEEN ABLE TO TELL JUST WHAT IS THE WISEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE KIND OF WORK THAT CAN BE DONE IN RAYMOND BUT I DO KNOW THIS MUCH
3947-13260-0011 MY MONEY I MEAN GOD'S WHICH HE WANTS ME TO USE CAN BUILD WHOLESOME LODGING HOUSES REFUGES FOR POOR WOMEN ASYLUMS FOR SHOP GIRLS SAFETY FOR MANY AND MANY A LOST GIRL LIKE LOREEN
3947-13260-0012 AND I DO NOT WANT TO BE SIMPLY A DISPENSER OF THIS MONEY GOD HELP ME I DO WANT TO PUT MYSELF INTO THE PROBLEM BUT YOU KNOW RACHEL I HAVE A FEELING ALL THE TIME THAT ALL THAT LIMITLESS MONEY AND LIMITLESS PERSONAL SACRIFICE CAN POSSIBLY DO
3947-13260-0013 WILL NOT REALLY LESSEN VERY MUCH THE AWFUL CONDITION AT THE RECTANGLE AS LONG AS THE SALOON IS LEGALLY ESTABLISHED THERE I THINK THAT IS TRUE OF ANY CHRISTIAN WORK NOW BEING CARRIED ON IN ANY GREAT CITY
3947-13260-0014 THE SALOON FURNISHES MATERIAL TO BE SAVED FASTER THAN THE SETTLEMENT OR RESIDENCE OR RESCUE MISSION WORK CAN SAVE IT VIRGINIA SUDDENLY ROSE AND PACED THE HALL RACHEL ANSWERED SADLY AND YET WITH A NOTE OF HOPE IN HER VOICE
3947-13260-0015 BUT VIRGINIA WHAT A WONDERFUL AMOUNT OF GOOD CAN BE DONE WITH THIS MONEY AND THE SALOON CANNOT ALWAYS REMAIN HERE THE TIME MUST COME WHEN THE CHRISTIAN FORCES IN THE CITY WILL TRIUMPH VIRGINIA PAUSED NEAR RACHEL AND HER PALE EARNEST FACE LIGHTED UP
3947-13260-0016 I BELIEVE THAT TOO THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO HAVE PROMISED TO DO AS JESUS WOULD IS INCREASING IF WE ONCE HAVE SAY FIVE HUNDRED SUCH DISCIPLES IN RAYMOND THE SALOON IS DOOMED
3947-13260-0017 BUT NOW DEAR I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT YOUR PART IN THIS PLAN FOR CAPTURING AND SAVING THE RECTANGLE YOUR VOICE IS A POWER I HAVE HAD MANY IDEAS LATELY HERE IS ONE OF THEM YOU COULD ORGANIZE AMONG THE GIRLS A MUSICAL INSTITUTE
3947-13260-0018 GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT OF YOUR TRAINING THERE ARE SOME SPLENDID VOICES IN THE ROUGH THERE DID ANY ONE EVER HEAR SUCH SINGING AS THAT YESTERDAY BY THOSE WOMEN RACHEL WHAT A BEAUTIFUL OPPORTUNITY
3947-13260-0019 YOU SHALL HAVE THE BEST OF MATERIAL IN THE WAY OF ORGANS AND ORCHESTRAS THAT MONEY CAN PROVIDE AND WHAT CANNOT BE DONE WITH MUSIC TO WIN SOULS THERE INTO HIGHER AND PURER AND BETTER LIVING
3947-13260-0020 BEFORE VIRGINIA HAD CEASED SPEAKING RACHEL'S FACE WAS PERFECTLY TRANSFORMED WITH THE THOUGHT OF HER LIFE WORK IT FLOWED INTO HER HEART AND MIND LIKE A FLOOD AND THE TORRENT OF HER FEELING OVERFLOWED IN TEARS THAT COULD NOT BE RESTRAINED
3947-13260-0021 IT WAS WHAT SHE HAD DREAMED OF DOING HERSELF IT REPRESENTED TO HER SOMETHING THAT SHE FELT WAS IN KEEPING WITH A RIGHT USE OF HER TALENT YES SHE SAID AS SHE ROSE AND PUT HER ARM ABOUT VIRGINIA
3947-13260-0022 WHILE BOTH GIRLS IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THEIR ENTHUSIASM PACED THE HALL YES I WILL GLADLY PUT MY LIFE INTO THAT KIND OF SERVICE I DO BELIEVE THAT JESUS WOULD HAVE ME USE MY LIFE IN THIS WAY VIRGINIA WHAT MIRACLES CAN WE NOT ACCOMPLISH IN HUMANITY
3947-13260-0023 IF WE HAVE SUCH A LEVER AS CONSECRATED MONEY TO MOVE THINGS WITH ADD TO IT CONSECRATED PERSONAL ENTHUSIASM LIKE YOURS AND IT CERTAINLY CAN ACCOMPLISH GREAT THINGS SAID VIRGINIA SMILING
3947-13260-0024 ROLLIN CAME BACK AND SAT DOWN AND TOGETHER THE THREE DISCUSSED THEIR FUTURE PLANS ROLLIN WAS APPARENTLY ENTIRELY FREE FROM EMBARRASSMENT IN RACHEL'S PRESENCE WHILE VIRGINIA WAS WITH THEM ONLY HIS MANNER WITH HER WAS ALMOST PRECISE IF NOT COLD
3947-13260-0025 THE PAST SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY ABSORBED IN HIS WONDERFUL CONVERSION HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN IT BUT HE SEEMED TO BE COMPLETELY CAUGHT UP FOR THIS PRESENT TIME IN THE PURPOSE OF HIS NEW LIFE
3947-13260-0026 AFTER A WHILE ROLLIN WAS CALLED OUT AND RACHEL AND VIRGINIA BEGAN TO TALK OF OTHER THINGS BY THE WAY WHAT HAS BECOME OF JASPER CHASE VIRGINIA ASKED THE QUESTION INNOCENTLY BUT RACHEL FLUSHED AND VIRGINIA ADDED WITH A SMILE
3947-13260-0027 I SUPPOSE HE IS WRITING ANOTHER BOOK IS HE GOING TO PUT YOU INTO THIS ONE RACHEL YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SUSPECTED JASPER CHASE OF DOING THAT VERY THING IN HIS FIRST STORY VIRGINIA
3947-13260-0028 RACHEL SPOKE WITH THE FRANKNESS THAT HAD ALWAYS EXISTED BETWEEN THE TWO FRIENDS JASPER CHASE TOLD ME THE OTHER NIGHT THAT HE IN FACT HE PROPOSED TO ME OR HE WOULD IF
3947-13260-0029 RACHEL STOPPED AND SAT WITH HER HANDS CLASPED ON HER LAP AND THERE WERE TEARS IN HER EYES VIRGINIA I THOUGHT A LITTLE WHILE AGO I LOVED HIM AS HE SAID HE LOVED ME BUT WHEN HE SPOKE MY HEART FELT REPELLED AND I SAID WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY
3947-13260-0030 I TOLD HIM NO I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM SINCE THAT WAS THE NIGHT OF THE FIRST CONVERSIONS AT THE RECTANGLE I AM GLAD FOR YOU SAID VIRGINIA QUIETLY WHY ASKED RACHEL A LITTLE STARTLED
3947-13260-0031 BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER REALLY LIKED JASPER CHASE HE IS TOO COLD AND I DO NOT LIKE TO JUDGE HIM BUT I HAVE ALWAYS DISTRUSTED HIS SINCERITY IN TAKING THE PLEDGE AT THE CHURCH WITH THE REST
3947-13260-0032 RACHEL LOOKED AT VIRGINIA THOUGHTFULLY I HAVE NEVER GIVEN MY HEART TO HIM I AM SURE HE TOUCHED MY EMOTIONS AND I ADMIRED HIS SKILL AS A WRITER I HAVE THOUGHT AT TIMES THAT I CARED A GOOD DEAL FOR HIM
3947-13260-0033 I THINK PERHAPS IF HE HAD SPOKEN TO ME AT ANY OTHER TIME THAN THE ONE HE CHOSE I COULD EASILY HAVE PERSUADED MYSELF THAT I LOVED HIM BUT NOT NOW AGAIN RACHEL PAUSED SUDDENLY AND WHEN SHE LOOKED UP AT VIRGINIA AGAIN THERE WERE TEARS ON HER FACE
3947-13260-0034 VIRGINIA CAME TO HER AND PUT HER ARM ABOUT HER TENDERLY WHEN RACHEL HAD LEFT THE HOUSE VIRGINIA SAT IN THE HALL THINKING OVER THE CONFIDENCE HER FRIEND HAD JUST SHOWN HER THERE WAS SOMETHING STILL TO BE TOLD VIRGINIA FELT SURE FROM RACHEL'S MANNER
3947-13260-0035 BUT SHE DID NOT FEEL HURT THAT RACHEL HAD KEPT BACK SOMETHING SHE WAS SIMPLY CONSCIOUS OF MORE ON RACHEL'S MIND THAN SHE HAD REVEALED VERY SOON ROLLIN CAME BACK AND HE AND VIRGINIA ARM IN ARM AS THEY HAD LATELY BEEN IN THE HABIT OF DOING WALKED UP AND DOWN THE LONG HALL
3947-13260-0036 IT WAS EASY FOR THEIR TALK TO SETTLE FINALLY UPON RACHEL BECAUSE OF THE PLACE SHE WAS TO OCCUPY IN THE PLANS WHICH WERE BEING MADE FOR THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY AT THE RECTANGLE
3947-13260-0037 DID YOU EVER KNOW OF A GIRL OF SUCH REALLY GIFTED POWERS IN VOCAL MUSIC WHO WAS WILLING TO GIVE HER LIFE TO THE PEOPLE AS RACHEL IS GOING TO DO SHE IS GOING TO GIVE MUSIC LESSONS IN THE CITY HAVE PRIVATE PUPILS TO MAKE HER LIVING
3947-13260-0038 AND THEN GIVE THE PEOPLE IN THE RECTANGLE THE BENEFIT OF HER CULTURE AND HER VOICE IT IS CERTAINLY A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF SELF SACRIFICE REPLIED ROLLIN A LITTLE STIFFLY VIRGINIA LOOKED AT HIM A LITTLE SHARPLY
3947-13260-0039 BUT DON'T YOU THINK IT IS A VERY UNUSUAL EXAMPLE CAN YOU IMAGINE HERE VIRGINIA NAMED HALF A DOZEN FAMOUS OPERA SINGERS DOING ANYTHING OF THIS SORT NO I CANNOT ROLLIN ANSWERED BRIEFLY
3947-13260-0040 NEITHER CAN I IMAGINE MISS HE SPOKE THE NAME OF THE GIRL WITH THE RED PARASOL WHO HAD BEGGED VIRGINIA TO TAKE THE GIRLS TO THE RECTANGLE DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING VIRGINIA ANY MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE MISTER
3947-13260-0041 VIRGINIA SPOKE THE NAME OF A YOUNG SOCIETY LEADER GOING ABOUT TO THE CLUBS DOING YOUR WORK ROLLIN THE TWO WALKED ON IN SILENCE FOR THE LENGTH OF THE HALL COMING BACK TO RACHEL BEGAN VIRGINIA
3947-13260-0042 ROLLIN WHY DO YOU TREAT HER WITH SUCH A DISTINCT PRECISE MANNER I THINK ROLLIN PARDON ME IF I HURT YOU THAT SHE IS ANNOYED BY IT YOU NEED TO BE ON EASY TERMS I DON'T THINK RACHEL LIKES THIS CHANGE
3947-13260-0043 ROLLIN SUDDENLY STOPPED HE SEEMED DEEPLY AGITATED HE TOOK HIS ARM FROM VIRGINIA'S AND WALKED ALONE TO THE END OF THE HALL THEN HE RETURNED WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM AND STOPPED NEAR HIS SISTER AND SAID
3947-13260-0044 VIRGINIA HAVE YOU NOT LEARNED MY SECRET VIRGINIA LOOKED BEWILDERED THEN OVER HER FACE THE UNUSUAL COLOR CREPT SHOWING THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD I HAVE NEVER LOVED ANY ONE BUT RACHEL WINSLOW ROLLIN SPOKE CALMLY ENOUGH NOW
3947-13260-0045 THAT DAY SHE WAS HERE WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT HER REFUSAL TO JOIN THE CONCERT COMPANY I ASKED HER TO BE MY WIFE OUT THERE ON THE AVENUE SHE REFUSED ME AS I KNEW SHE WOULD AND SHE GAVE AS HER REASON THE FACT THAT I HAD NO PURPOSE IN LIFE WHICH WAS TRUE ENOUGH
3947-13260-0046 NOW THAT I HAVE A PURPOSE NOW THAT I AM A NEW MAN DON'T YOU SEE VIRGINIA HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS FOR ME TO SAY ANYTHING I OWE MY VERY CONVERSION TO RACHEL'S SINGING
3947-13260-0047 AND YET THAT NIGHT WHILE SHE SANG I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT FOR THE TIME BEING I NEVER THOUGHT OF HER VOICE EXCEPT AS GOD'S MESSAGE I BELIEVE THAT ALL MY PERSONAL LOVE FOR HER WAS FOR THE TIME MERGED INTO A PERSONAL LOVE TO MY GOD AND MY SAVIOUR
3947-13260-0048 ROLLIN WAS SILENT THEN HE WENT ON WITH MORE EMOTION I STILL LOVE HER VIRGINIA
3947-13260-0049 HE STOPPED AND LOOKED HIS SISTER IN THE FACE WITH A SAD SMILE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT SAID VIRGINIA TO HERSELF SHE WAS NOTING ROLLIN'S HANDSOME FACE HIS MARKS OF DISSIPATION NEARLY ALL GONE NOW
3947-13260-0050 THE FIRM LIPS SHOWING MANHOOD AND COURAGE THE CLEAR EYES LOOKING INTO HERS FRANKLY THE FORM STRONG AND GRACEFUL ROLLIN WAS A MAN NOW WHY SHOULD NOT RACHEL COME TO LOVE HIM IN TIME
3947-13262-0000 HE HAD COME SUDDENLY UPON HER AS HE TURNED INTO THE AVENUE AND HIS HEART HAD LEAPED UP AT THE SIGHT OF HER HE WALKED ALONG BY HER NOW REJOICING AFTER ALL IN A LITTLE MOMENT OF THIS EARTHLY LOVE HE COULD NOT DRIVE OUT OF HIS LIFE I HAVE JUST BEEN OVER TO SEE VIRGINIA
3947-13262-0001 SAID RACHEL SHE TELLS ME THE ARRANGEMENTS ARE NEARLY COMPLETED FOR THE TRANSFER OF THE RECTANGLE PROPERTY YES IT HAS BEEN A TEDIOUS CASE IN THE COURTS DID VIRGINIA SHOW YOU ALL THE PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS FOR BUILDING
3947-13262-0002 WE LOOKED OVER A GOOD MANY IT IS ASTONISHING TO ME WHERE VIRGINIA HAS MANAGED TO GET ALL HER IDEAS ABOUT THIS WORK VIRGINIA KNOWS MORE NOW ABOUT ARNOLD TOYNBEE AND EAST END LONDON AND INSTITUTIONAL CHURCH WORK IN AMERICA
3947-13262-0003 THAN A GOOD MANY PROFESSIONAL SLUM WORKERS SHE HAS BEEN SPENDING NEARLY ALL SUMMER IN GETTING INFORMATION ROLLIN WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL MORE AT EASE AS THEY TALKED OVER THIS COMING WORK OF HUMANITY IT WAS SAFE COMMON GROUND
3947-13262-0004 WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING ALL SUMMER I HAVE NOT SEEN MUCH OF YOU RACHEL SUDDENLY ASKED AND THEN HER FACE WARMED WITH ITS QUICK FLUSH OF TROPICAL COLOR AS IF SHE MIGHT HAVE IMPLIED TOO MUCH INTEREST IN ROLLIN OR TOO MUCH REGRET AT NOT SEEING HIM OFTENER
3947-13262-0005 I HAVE BEEN BUSY REPLIED ROLLIN BRIEFLY TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT IT PERSISTED RACHEL YOU SAY SO LITTLE
3947-13262-0006 SHE PUT THE QUESTION VERY FRANKLY TURNING TOWARD ROLLIN IN REAL EARNEST YES CERTAINLY HE REPLIED WITH A GRACEFUL SMILE I AM NOT SO CERTAIN THAT I CAN TELL YOU MUCH
3947-13262-0007 I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND SOME WAY TO REACH THE MEN I ONCE KNEW AND WIN THEM INTO MORE USEFUL LIVES HE STOPPED SUDDENLY AS IF HE WERE ALMOST AFRAID TO GO ON RACHEL DID NOT VENTURE TO SUGGEST ANYTHING
3947-13262-0008 I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE SAME COMPANY TO WHICH YOU AND VIRGINIA BELONG CONTINUED ROLLIN BEGINNING AGAIN I HAVE MADE THE PLEDGE TO DO AS I BELIEVE JESUS WOULD DO
3947-13262-0009 AND IT IS IN TRYING TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION THAT I HAVE BEEN DOING MY WORK THAT IS WHAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND VIRGINIA TOLD ME ABOUT THE OTHER IT SEEMS WONDERFUL TO THINK THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO KEEP THAT PLEDGE WITH US BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH THE CLUB MEN
3947-13262-0010 YOU HAVE ASKED ME A DIRECT QUESTION AND I SHALL HAVE TO ANSWER IT NOW REPLIED ROLLIN SMILING AGAIN YOU SEE I ASKED MYSELF AFTER THAT NIGHT AT THE TENT YOU REMEMBER HE SPOKE HURRIEDLY AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED A LITTLE
3947-13262-0011 WHAT PURPOSE I COULD NOW HAVE IN MY LIFE TO REDEEM IT TO SATISFY MY THOUGHT OF CHRISTIAN DISCIPLESHIP AND THE MORE I THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE I WAS DRIVEN TO A PLACE WHERE I KNEW I MUST TAKE UP THE CROSS
3947-13262-0012 DID YOU EVER THINK THAT OF ALL THE NEGLECTED BEINGS IN OUR SOCIAL SYSTEM NONE ARE QUITE SO COMPLETELY LEFT ALONE AS THE FAST YOUNG MEN WHO FILL THE CLUBS AND WASTE THEIR TIME AND MONEY AS I USED TO
3947-13262-0013 THE CHURCHES LOOK AFTER THE POOR MISERABLE CREATURES LIKE THOSE IN THE RECTANGLE THEY MAKE SOME EFFORT TO REACH THE WORKING MAN THEY HAVE A LARGE CONSTITUENCY AMONG THE AVERAGE SALARY EARNING PEOPLE THEY SEND MONEY AND MISSIONARIES TO THE FOREIGN HEATHEN
3947-13262-0014 BUT THE FASHIONABLE DISSIPATED YOUNG MEN AROUND TOWN THE CLUB MEN ARE LEFT OUT OF ALL PLANS FOR REACHING AND CHRISTIANIZING AND YET NO CLASS OF PEOPLE NEED IT MORE I SAID TO MYSELF I KNOW THESE MEN THEIR GOOD AND THEIR BAD QUALITIES I HAVE BEEN ONE OF THEM
3947-13262-0015 I AM NOT FITTED TO REACH THE RECTANGLE PEOPLE I DO NOT KNOW HOW BUT I THINK I COULD POSSIBLY REACH SOME OF THE YOUNG MEN AND BOYS WHO HAVE MONEY AND TIME TO SPEND SO THAT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO
3947-13262-0016 WHEN I ASKED AS YOU DID WHAT WOULD JESUS DO THAT WAS MY ANSWER
3947-13262-0017 ROLLIN'S VOICE WAS SO LOW ON THIS LAST SENTENCE THAT RACHEL HAD DIFFICULTY IN HEARING HIM ABOVE THE NOISE AROUND THEM BUT SHE KNEW WHAT HE HAD SAID SHE WANTED TO ASK WHAT HIS METHODS WERE BUT SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO ASK HIM
3947-13262-0018 HER INTEREST IN HIS PLAN WAS LARGER THAN MERE CURIOSITY ROLLIN PAGE WAS SO DIFFERENT NOW FROM THE FASHIONABLE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD ASKED HER TO BE HIS WIFE THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP THINKING OF HIM AND TALKING WITH HIM AS IF HE WERE AN ENTIRELY NEW ACQUAINTANCE
3947-13262-0019 THEY HAD TURNED OFF THE AVENUE AND WERE GOING UP THE STREET TO RACHEL'S HOME IT WAS THE SAME STREET WHERE ROLLIN HAD ASKED RACHEL WHY SHE COULD NOT LOVE HIM THEY WERE BOTH STRICKEN WITH A SUDDEN SHYNESS AS THEY WENT ON
3947-13262-0020 RACHEL HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THAT DAY AND ROLLIN COULD NOT SHE FINALLY BROKE A LONG SILENCE BY ASKING WHAT SHE HAD NOT FOUND WORDS FOR BEFORE
3947-13262-0021 IN YOUR WORK WITH THE CLUB MEN WITH YOUR OLD ACQUAINTANCES WHAT SORT OF RECEPTION DO THEY GIVE YOU HOW DO YOU APPROACH THEM WHAT DO THEY SAY ROLLIN WAS RELIEVED WHEN RACHEL SPOKE HE ANSWERED QUICKLY OH IT DEPENDS ON THE MAN
3947-13262-0022 A GOOD MANY OF THEM THINK I AM A CRANK I HAVE KEPT MY MEMBERSHIP UP AND AM IN GOOD STANDING IN THAT WAY I TRY TO BE WISE AND NOT PROVOKE ANY UNNECESSARY CRITICISM BUT YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED TO KNOW HOW MANY OF THE MEN HAVE RESPONDED TO MY APPEAL
3947-13262-0023 I COULD HARDLY MAKE YOU BELIEVE THAT ONLY A FEW NIGHTS AGO A DOZEN MEN BECAME HONESTLY AND EARNESTLY ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION OVER RELIGIOUS MATTERS I HAVE HAD THE GREAT JOY OF SEEING SOME OF THE MEN GIVE UP BAD HABITS AND BEGIN A NEW LIFE
3947-13262-0024 WHAT WOULD JESUS DO I KEEP ASKING IT THE ANSWER COMES SLOWLY FOR I AM FEELING MY WAY SLOWLY ONE THING I HAVE FOUND OUT THE MEN ARE NOT FIGHTING SHY OF ME I THINK THAT IS A GOOD SIGN
3947-13262-0025 ANOTHER THING I HAVE ACTUALLY INTERESTED SOME OF THEM IN THE RECTANGLE WORK AND WHEN IT IS STARTED UP THEY WILL GIVE SOMETHING TO HELP MAKE IT MORE POWERFUL AND IN ADDITION TO ALL THE REST I HAVE FOUND A WAY TO SAVE SEVERAL OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS FROM GOING TO THE BAD IN GAMBLING
3947-13262-0026 ROLLIN SPOKE WITH ENTHUSIASM HIS FACE WAS TRANSFORMED BY HIS INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT WHICH HAD NOW BECOME A PART OF HIS REAL LIFE RACHEL AGAIN NOTED THE STRONG MANLY TONE OF HIS SPEECH
3947-13262-0027 WITH IT ALL SHE KNEW THERE WAS A DEEP UNDERLYING SERIOUSNESS WHICH FELT THE BURDEN OF THE CROSS EVEN WHILE CARRYING IT WITH JOY THE NEXT TIME SHE SPOKE IT WAS WITH A SWIFT FEELING OF JUSTICE DUE TO ROLLIN AND HIS NEW LIFE
3947-13262-0028 DO YOU REMEMBER I REPROACHED YOU ONCE FOR NOT HAVING ANY PURPOSE WORTH LIVING FOR SHE ASKED WHILE HER BEAUTIFUL FACE SEEMED TO ROLLIN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER WHEN HE HAD WON SUFFICIENT SELF CONTROL TO LOOK UP I WANT TO SAY
3947-13262-0029 I FEEL THE NEED OF SAYING IN JUSTICE TO YOU NOW THAT I HONOR YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE AND YOUR OBEDIENCE TO THE PROMISE YOU HAVE MADE AS YOU INTERPRET THE PROMISE THE LIFE YOU ARE LIVING IS A NOBLE ONE ROLLIN TREMBLED HIS AGITATION WAS GREATER THAN HE COULD CONTROL
3947-13262-0030 RACHEL COULD NOT HELP SEEING IT THEY WALKED ALONG IN SILENCE AT LAST ROLLIN SAID I THANK YOU IT HAS BEEN WORTH MORE TO ME THAN I CAN TELL YOU TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT HE LOOKED INTO HER FACE FOR ONE MOMENT
3947-13262-0031 SHE READ HIS LOVE FOR HER IN THAT LOOK BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK WHEN THEY SEPARATED RACHEL WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND SITTING DOWN IN HER ROOM SHE PUT HER FACE IN HER HANDS AND SAID TO HERSELF
3947-13262-0032 I AM BEGINNING TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE LOVED BY A NOBLE MAN I SHALL LOVE ROLLIN PAGE AFTER ALL WHAT AM I SAYING RACHEL WINSLOW HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN SHE ROSE AND WALKED BACK AND FORTH SHE WAS DEEPLY MOVED
3947-13262-0033 NEVERTHELESS IT WAS EVIDENT TO HERSELF THAT HER EMOTION WAS NOT THAT OF REGRET OR SORROW SOMEHOW A GLAD NEW JOY HAD COME TO HER
3947-13262-0034 IT WAS INDEED A PART OF IT FOR IF SHE WAS BEGINNING TO LOVE ROLLIN PAGE IT WAS THE CHRISTIAN MAN SHE HAD BEGUN TO LOVE THE OTHER NEVER WOULD HAVE MOVED HER TO THIS GREAT CHANGE
3947-13262-0035 AND ROLLIN AS HE WENT BACK TREASURED A HOPE THAT HAD BEEN A STRANGER TO HIM SINCE RACHEL HAD SAID NO THAT DAY
3947-13262-0036 IN THAT HOPE HE WENT ON WITH HIS WORK AS THE DAYS SPED ON AND AT NO TIME WAS HE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN REACHING AND SAVING HIS OLD ACQUAINTANCES THAN IN THE TIME THAT FOLLOWED THAT CHANCE MEETING WITH RACHEL WINSLOW
3947-13262-0037 THE SUMMER HAD GONE AND RAYMOND WAS ONCE MORE FACING THE RIGOR OF HER WINTER SEASON VIRGINIA HAD BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH A PART OF HER PLAN FOR CAPTURING THE RECTANGLE AS SHE CALLED IT
3947-13262-0038 BUT THE BUILDING OF HOUSES IN THE FIELD THE TRANSFORMING OF ITS BLEAK BARE ASPECT INTO AN ATTRACTIVE PARK ALL OF WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN HER PLAN WAS A WORK TOO LARGE TO BE COMPLETED THAT FALL AFTER SHE HAD SECURED THE PROPERTY
3947-13262-0039 BUT A MILLION DOLLARS IN THE HANDS OF A PERSON WHO TRULY WANTS TO DO WITH IT AS JESUS WOULD
3947-13262-0040 OUGHT TO ACCOMPLISH WONDERS FOR HUMANITY IN A SHORT TIME AND HENRY MAXWELL GOING OVER TO THE SCENE OF THE NEW WORK ONE DAY AFTER A NOON HOUR WITH THE SHOP MEN WAS AMAZED TO SEE HOW MUCH HAD BEEN DONE OUTWARDLY
3947-13262-0041 YET HE WALKED HOME THOUGHTFULLY AND ON HIS WAY HE COULD NOT AVOID THE QUESTION OF THE CONTINUAL PROBLEM THRUST UPON HIS NOTICE BY THE SALOON HOW MUCH HAD BEEN DONE FOR THE RECTANGLE AFTER ALL
3947-13262-0042 EVEN COUNTING VIRGINIA'S AND RACHEL'S WORK AND MISTER GRAY'S WHERE HAD IT ACTUALLY COUNTED IN ANY VISIBLE QUANTITY
3947-13262-0043 OF COURSE HE SAID TO HIMSELF THE REDEMPTIVE WORK BEGUN AND CARRIED ON BY THE HOLY SPIRIT IN HIS WONDERFUL DISPLAYS OF POWER IN THE FIRST CHURCH AND IN THE TENT MEETINGS HAD HAD ITS EFFECT UPON THE LIFE OF RAYMOND
3947-13262-0044 BUT AS HE WALKED PAST SALOON AFTER SALOON AND NOTED THE CROWDS GOING IN AND COMING OUT OF THEM AS HE SAW THE WRETCHED DENS AS MANY AS EVER APPARENTLY
3947-13262-0045 HE SICKENED AT THE SIGHT HE FOUND HIMSELF ASKING HOW MUCH CLEANSING COULD A MILLION DOLLARS POURED INTO THIS CESSPOOL ACCOMPLISH
3947-13262-0046 WAS NOT THE LIVING SOURCE OF NEARLY ALL THE HUMAN MISERY THEY SOUGHT TO RELIEVE UNTOUCHED AS LONG AS THE SALOONS DID THEIR DEADLY BUT LEGITIMATE WORK
3947-13262-0047 WAS IT NOT A PRACTICAL WASTE OF BEAUTIFUL LIVES FOR THESE YOUNG WOMEN TO THROW THEMSELVES INTO THIS EARTHLY HELL WHEN FOR EVERY SOUL RESCUED BY THEIR SACRIFICE THE SALOON MADE TWO MORE THAT NEEDED RESCUE HE COULD NOT ESCAPE THE QUESTION
3947-13262-0048 IT WAS THE SAME THAT VIRGINIA HAD PUT TO RACHEL IN HER STATEMENT THAT IN HER OPINION NOTHING REALLY PERMANENT WOULD EVER BE DONE UNTIL THE SALOON WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE RECTANGLE
3947-13262-0049 HENRY MAXWELL WENT BACK TO HIS PARISH WORK THAT AFTERNOON WITH ADDED CONVICTIONS ON THE LICENSE BUSINESS BUT IF THE SALOON WAS A FACTOR IN THE PROBLEM OF THE LIFE OF RAYMOND NO LESS WAS THE FIRST CHURCH AND ITS LITTLE COMPANY OF DISCIPLES WHO HAD PLEDGED TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO
3947-13262-0050 HENRY MAXWELL STANDING AT THE VERY CENTRE OF THE MOVEMENT WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO JUDGE OF ITS POWER AS SOME ONE FROM THE OUTSIDE MIGHT HAVE DONE BUT RAYMOND ITSELF FELT THE TOUCH IN VERY MANY WAYS NOT KNOWING ALL THE REASONS FOR THE CHANGE
3947-13262-0051 THE WINTER WAS GONE AND THE YEAR WAS ENDED THE YEAR WHICH HENRY MAXWELL HAD FIXED AS THE TIME DURING WHICH THE PLEDGE SHOULD BE KEPT TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO SUNDAY THE ANNIVERSARY OF THAT ONE A YEAR AGO WAS IN MANY WAYS THE MOST REMARKABLE DAY THAT THE FIRST CHURCH EVER KNEW
3982-178459-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY NINE AS BIBBS CAME OUT OF THE NEW HOUSE A SUNDAY TRIO WAS IN COURSE OF PASSAGE UPON THE SIDEWALK AN AMPLE YOUNG WOMAN PLACID OF FACE A BLACK CLAD
3982-178459-0001 THIN YOUNG MAN WHOSE EXPRESSION WAS ONE OF HABITUAL ANXIETY HABITUAL WARINESS AND HABITUAL EAGERNESS HE PROPELLED A PERAMBULATOR CONTAINING THE THIRD

3982-178459-0004 WELL MAYBE IF YOU KEEP ON THE WAY YOU BEEN
3982-178459-0005 SHE GLANCED BACK AT BIBBS WHO HAD TURNED NORTH HE WALKS KIND OF SLOW AND STOOPED OVER LIKE SO MUCH MONEY IN HIS POCKETS IT MAKES HIM SAG I GUESS SAID THE YOUNG HUSBAND WITH BITTER ADMIRATION
3982-178459-0006 MARY HAPPENING TO GLANCE FROM A WINDOW SAW BIBBS COMING AND SHE STARTED CLASPING HER HANDS TOGETHER IN A SUDDEN ALARM
3982-178459-0007 WHAT IS THE MATTER I SAW SOMETHING WAS TERRIBLY WRONG WHEN I
3982-178459-0008 SHE PAUSED AND HE CAME IN NOT LIFTING HIS EYES TO HERS ALWAYS WHEN HE CROSSED THAT THRESHOLD HE HAD COME WITH HIS HEAD UP AND HIS WISTFUL GAZE SEEKING HERS
3982-178459-0009 AH POOR BOY SHE SAID WITH A GESTURE OF UNDERSTANDING AND PITY I KNOW WHAT IT IS HE FOLLOWED HER INTO THE ROOM WHERE THEY ALWAYS SAT AND SANK INTO A CHAIR YOU NEEDN'T TELL ME SHE SAID
3982-178459-0010 THEY'VE MADE YOU GIVE UP YOUR FATHER'S WON YOU'RE GOING TO DO WHAT HE WANTS YOU'VE GIVEN UP
3982-178459-0011 AFFIRMATION SHE GAVE A LITTLE CRY OF COMPASSION AND CAME AND SAT NEAR HIM BIBBS SHE SAID I CAN BE GLAD OF ONE THING THOUGH IT'S SELFISH I CAN BE GLAD YOU CAME STRAIGHT TO ME IT'S MORE TO ME THAN EVEN IF YOU'D COME BECAUSE YOU WERE HAPPY
3982-178459-0012 SHE DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN FOR A LITTLE WHILE THEN SHE SAID
3982-178459-0013 COULD YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT DO YOU WANT TO STILL HE DID NOT LOOK UP BUT IN A VOICE SHAKEN AND HUSKY HE ASKED HER A QUESTION SO GROTESQUE THAT AT FIRST SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD MISUNDERSTOOD HIS WORDS
3982-178459-0014 MARY HE SAID COULD YOU MARRY ME WHAT DID YOU SAY BIBBS SHE ASKED QUIETLY HIS TONE AND ATTITUDE DID NOT CHANGE WILL YOU MARRY ME
3982-178459-0015 BOTH OF HER HANDS LEAPED TO HER CHEEKS SHE GREW RED AND THEN WHITE SHE ROSE SLOWLY AND MOVED BACKWARD FROM HIM STARING AT HIM AT FIRST INCREDULOUSLY THEN WITH AN INTENSE PERPLEXITY MORE AND MORE LUMINOUS IN HER WIDE EYES
3982-178459-0016 IT WAS LIKE A SPOKEN QUESTION THE ROOM FILLED WITH STRANGENESS IN THE LONG SILENCE THE TWO WERE SO STRANGE TO EACH OTHER AT LAST SHE SAID WHAT MADE YOU SAY THAT HE DID NOT ANSWER
3982-178459-0017 BIBBS LOOK AT ME HER VOICE WAS LOUD AND CLEAR WHAT MADE YOU SAY THAT LOOK AT ME HE COULD NOT LOOK AT HER AND HE COULD NOT SPEAK WHAT WAS IT THAT MADE YOU SHE SAID I WANT YOU TO TELL ME

3982-178459-0021 WITH A TREMULOUS MURMUR OF AMAZEMENT AND DAWNING COMPREHENSION SHE REMEMBERED THAT SIBYL HAD GONE TO THE NEW HOUSE BIBBS SWALLOWED PAINFULLY AND CONTRIVED TO SAY I DO I DO WANT YOU TO MARRY ME IF IF
3982-178459-0022 YOU COULD SHE LOOKED AT HIM AND SLOWLY SHOOK HER HEAD BIBBS DO YOU HER VOICE WAS AS UNSTEADY AS HIS LITTLE MORE THAN A WHISPER DO YOU THINK I'M

3982-178459-0024 I'VE HAD NOTHING BUT DREAMS BIBBS SAID DESOLATELY BUT THEY WEREN'T LIKE THAT SIBYL SAID NO GIRL COULD CARE ABOUT ME HE SMILED FAINTLY
3982-178459-0025 AND WHEN I FIRST CAME HOME EDITH TOLD ME SIBYL WAS SO ANXIOUS TO MARRY THAT SHE'D HAVE MARRIED ME SHE MEANT IT TO EXPRESS SIBYL'S EXTREMITY YOU SEE BUT I HARDLY NEEDED EITHER OF THEM TO TELL ME I HADN'T THOUGHT OF MYSELF AS
3982-178459-0026 WELL NOT AS PARTICULARLY CAPTIVATING ODDLY ENOUGH MARY'S PALLOR CHANGED TO AN ANGRY FLUSH THOSE TWO SHE EXCLAIMED SHARPLY AND THEN WITH THOROUGHGOING CONTEMPT LAMHORN THAT'S LIKE THEM
3982-178459-0027 SHE TURNED AWAY WENT TO THE BARE LITTLE BLACK MANTEL AND STOOD LEANING UPON IT PRESENTLY SHE ASKED WHEN DID MISSUS ROSCOE SHERIDAN SAY THAT NO GIRL COULD CARE ABOUT YOU
3982-178459-0028 TO DAY MARY DREW A DEEP BREATH I THINK I'M BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE SHE BIT HER LIP THERE WAS ANGER IN GOOD TRUTH IN HER EYES AND IN HER VOICE

3982-178459-0031 AND THEN THAT I TRIED TO MARRY YOU YOU HEARD HER SAY THAT AND YOU BELIEVE THAT I DON'T CARE FOR YOU AND THAT NO GIRL COULD CARE FOR YOU BUT YOU THINK I AM IN SUCH AN EXTREMITY AS SIBYL WAS
3982-178459-0032 YOU TOOK YOUR FATHER'S OFFER AND THEN CAME TO ASK ME TO MARRY YOU WHAT HAD I SHOWN YOU OF MYSELF THAT COULD MAKE YOU SUDDENLY SHE SANK DOWN KNEELING WITH HER FACE BURIED IN HER ARMS UPON THE LAP OF A CHAIR
3982-178459-0033 TEARS OVERWHELMING HER MARY MARY HE CRIED HELPLESSLY OH NO YOU YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND I DO THOUGH SHE SOBBED I DO HE CAME AND STOOD BESIDE HER YOU KILL ME
3982-178459-0034 HE SAID I CAN'T MAKE IT PLAIN FROM THE FIRST OF YOUR LOVELINESS TO ME I WAS ALL SELF IT WAS ALWAYS YOU THAT GAVE AND I THAT TOOK I WAS THE DEPENDENT I DID NOTHING BUT LEAN ON YOU
3982-178459-0035 YOU SEEMED TO LEAN DOWN OUT OF A ROSY CLOUD TO BE KIND TO ME I NEVER DREAMED I COULD DO ANYTHING FOR YOU I NEVER DREAMED YOU COULD NEED ANYTHING TO BE DONE FOR YOU BY ANYBODY
3982-178459-0036 AND TO DAY I HEARD THAT THAT YOU

3982-178459-0038 I KNEW YOU'D NEVER THOUGHT OF ME EXCEPT GENEROUSLY TO GIVE I SAID I COULDN'T MAKE IT PLAIN HE CRIED DESPAIRINGLY WAIT SHE LIFTED HER HEAD AND EXTENDED HER HANDS TO HIM UNCONSCIOUSLY LIKE A CHILD
3982-178459-0039 HELP ME UP BIBBS THEN WHEN SHE WAS ONCE MORE UPON HER FEET SHE WIPED HER EYES AND SMILED UPON HIM RUEFULLY AND FAINTLY BUT REASSURINGLY AS IF TO TELL HIM IN THAT WAY
3982-178459-0040 THAT SHE KNEW HE HAD NOT MEANT TO HURT HER AND THAT SMILE OF HERS SO LAMENTABLE BUT SO FAITHFULLY FRIENDLY MISTED HIS OWN EYES FOR HIS SHAMEFACEDNESS LOWERED THEM NO MORE
3982-178459-0041 LET ME TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO TELL ME SHE SAID YOU CAN'T BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PUT IT INTO WORDS THEY ARE TOO HUMILIATING FOR ME AND YOU'RE TOO GENTLE TO SAY THEM TELL ME THOUGH ISN'T IT TRUE
3982-178459-0042 YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT I'D TRIED TO MAKE YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH ME NEVER NEVER FOR AN INSTANT YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE I'D TRIED TO MAKE YOU WANT TO MARRY ME NO NO NO I BELIEVE IT BIBBS
3982-178459-0043 YOU THOUGHT THAT I WAS FOND OF YOU YOU KNEW I CARED FOR YOU BUT YOU DIDN'T THINK I MIGHT BE IN LOVE WITH YOU BUT YOU THOUGHT THAT I MIGHT MARRY YOU WITHOUT BEING IN LOVE WITH YOU
3982-178459-0044 BECAUSE YOU DID BELIEVE I HAD TRIED TO MARRY YOUR BROTHER AND MARY I ONLY KNEW FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU THAT YOU WERE WERE DESPERATELY POOR SHE SAID YOU CAN'T EVEN SAY THAT BIBBS IT WAS TRUE
3982-178459-0045 I DID TRY TO MAKE JIM WANT TO MARRY ME I DID AND SHE SANK DOWN INTO THE CHAIR WEEPING BITTERLY AGAIN BIBBS WAS AGONIZED MARY HE GROANED
3982-178459-0046 I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD CRY LISTEN SHE SAID LISTEN TILL I GET THROUGH I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND WE WERE POOR AND WE WEREN'T FITTED TO BE WE NEVER HAD BEEN AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
3982-178459-0047 WE'D BEEN ALMOST RICH THERE WAS PLENTY BUT MY FATHER WANTED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE GROWTH OF THE TOWN HE WANTED TO BE RICHER BUT INSTEAD WELL JUST ABOUT THE TIME YOUR FATHER FINISHED BUILDING NEXT DOOR
3982-178459-0048 WE FOUND WE HADN'T ANYTHING PEOPLE SAY THAT SOMETIMES MEANING THAT THEY HAVEN'T ANYTHING IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER PEOPLE OF THEIR OWN KIND BUT WE REALLY HADN'T ANYTHING WE HADN'T ANYTHING AT ALL BIBBS
3982-178459-0049 YOU MIGHT WONDER WHY I DIDN'T
3982-178459-0050 AND I WONDER MYSELF WHY WHEN A FAMILY LOSES ITS MONEY PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY THE DAUGHTERS OUGHT TO GO AND BE STENOGRAPHERS IT'S CURIOUS
3982-178459-0051 NO I'D BEEN RAISED TO BE EITHER MARRIED COMFORTABLY OR A WELL TO DO OLD MAID IF I CHOSE NOT TO MARRY THE POVERTY CAME ON SLOWLY BIBBS BUT AT LAST IT WAS ALL THERE
3982-178459-0052 AND I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO BE A STENOGRAPHER I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO BE ANYTHING EXCEPT A WELL TO DO OLD MAID OR SOMEBODY'S WIFE AND I COULDN'T BE A WELL TO DO OLD MAID THEN BIBBS I DID WHAT I'D BEEN RAISED TO KNOW HOW TO DO
3982-178459-0053 I WENT OUT TO BE FASCINATING AND BE MARRIED I DID IT OPENLY AT LEAST AND WITH A KIND OF DECENT HONESTY I TOLD YOUR BROTHER I HAD MEANT TO FASCINATE HIM
3982-178459-0054 BUT I LET HIM THINK THAT PERHAPS I MEANT TO MARRY HIM I THINK I DID MEAN TO MARRY HIM I HAD NEVER CARED FOR ANYBODY AND I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE THERE REALLY WASN'T ANYTHING MORE THAN A KIND OF EXCITED FONDNESS I CAN'T BE SURE
3982-178459-0055 BUT I THINK THAT THOUGH I DID MEAN TO MARRY HIM I NEVER SHOULD HAVE DONE IT BECAUSE THAT SORT OF A MARRIAGE IS IT'S SACRILEGE SOMETHING WOULD HAVE STOPPED ME
3982-178459-0056 SHE MEANT NO HARM BUT SHE WAS HORRIBLE AND SHE PUT WHAT I WAS DOING INTO SUCH HORRIBLE WORDS AND THEY WERE THE TRUTH OH I SAW MYSELF SHE WAS PROPOSING A MISERABLE COMPACT WITH ME
3982-178459-0057 AND I COULDN'T BREATHE THE AIR OF THE SAME ROOM WITH HER THOUGH I'D SO CHEAPENED MYSELF SHE HAD A RIGHT TO ASSUME THAT I WOULD BUT I COULDN'T I LEFT HER AND I WROTE TO YOUR BROTHER JUST A QUICK SCRAWL I TOLD HIM JUST WHAT I'D DONE

3982-178459-0059 SHE PRESSED HER CLENCHED HANDS TIGHTLY AGAINST HER EYES LEANING FAR FORWARD HER HEAD BOWED BEFORE HIM BIBBS HAD FORGOTTEN HIMSELF LONG AGO HIS HEART BROKE FOR HER COULDN'T YOU ISN'T THERE
3982-178459-0060 WON'T YOU HE STAMMERED MARY I'M GOING WITH FATHER ISN'T THERE SOME WAY YOU COULD USE THE MONEY WITHOUT WITHOUT SHE GAVE A CHOKED LITTLE LAUGH YOU GAVE ME SOMETHING TO LIVE FOR HE SAID YOU KEPT ME ALIVE I THINK
3982-178459-0061 AND I'VE HURT YOU LIKE THIS
3982-178459-0062 OH A THOUSAND TIMES HER RIGHT HAND WENT OUT IN A FALTERING GESTURE AND JUST TOUCHED HIS OWN FOR AN INSTANT BUT THERE'S NOTHING TO FORGIVE AND YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T
3982-178459-0063 CAN'T WHAT BIBBS YOU COULDN'T MARRY YOU SHE SAID FOR HIM YES NO NO NO SHE SPRANG UP FACING HIM
3982-178459-0064 AND WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT SHE DID SHE SET HER HANDS UPON HIS BREAST PUSHING HIM BACK FROM HER A LITTLE I CAN'T I CAN'T DON'T YOU SEE MARY NO NO AND YOU MUST GO NOW BIBBS I CAN'T BEAR ANY MORE PLEASE
3982-178459-0065 MARY NEVER NEVER NEVER SHE CRIED IN A PASSION OF TEARS YOU MUSTN'T COME ANY MORE I CAN'T SEE YOU DEAR NEVER NEVER NEVER SOMEHOW IN HELPLESS STUMBLING OBEDIENCE TO HER BESEECHING GESTURE
3982-178459-0066 HE GOT HIMSELF TO THE DOOR
3982-182255-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT THE GREAT FIGHT FOR CLEAN GOVERNMENT
3982-182255-0001 AS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THIS CITY SAID MISTER NEWBERRY LEANING BACK IN A LEATHER ARMCHAIR AT THE MAUSOLEUM CLUB AND LIGHTING A SECOND CIGAR IT'S ROTTEN THAT'S ALL
3982-182255-0002 ABSOLUTELY ROTTEN ASSENTED MISTER DICK OVEREND RINGING THE BELL FOR A SECOND WHISKEY AND SODA CORRUPT SAID MISTER NEWBERRY BETWEEN TWO PUFFS OF HIS CIGAR FULL OF GRAFT SAID MISTER OVEREND
3982-182255-0003 FLICKING HIS ASHES INTO THE GRATE CROOKED ALDERMEN SAID MISTER NEWBERRY A BUM CITY SOLICITOR SAID MISTER OVEREND AND AN INFERNAL GRAFTER FOR TREASURER YES ASSENTED MISTER NEWBERRY
3982-182255-0004 AND THEN LEANING FORWARDS IN HIS CHAIR AND LOOKING CAREFULLY ABOUT THE CORRIDORS OF THE CLUB HE SPOKE BEHIND HIS HAND AND SAID AND THE MAYOR'S THE BIGGEST GRAFTER OF THE LOT AND WHAT'S MORE HE ADDED
3982-182255-0005 SINKING HIS VOICE TO A WHISPER THE TIME HAS COME TO SPEAK OUT ABOUT IT FEARLESSLY MISTER OVEREND NODDED IT'S A TYRANNY HE SAID WORSE THAN RUSSIA REJOINED MISTER NEWBERRY
3982-182255-0006 THEY HAD BEEN SITTING IN A QUIET CORNER OF THE CLUB IT WAS ON A SUNDAY EVENING
3982-182255-0007 NOT ARGUMENTATIVELY OR WITH ANY HEAT BUT WITH THE REFLECTIVE SADNESS THAT STEALS OVER AN ELDERLY MAN WHEN HE SITS IN THE LEATHER ARMCHAIR OF A COMFORTABLE CLUB SMOKING A GOOD CIGAR AND MUSING ON THE DECADENCE OF THE PRESENT DAY
3982-182255-0008 THE ROTTENNESS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DIDN'T ANGER THEM IT MERELY GRIEVED THEM THEY COULD REMEMBER BOTH OF THEM HOW DIFFERENT EVERYTHING WAS WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG MEN JUST ENTERING ON LIFE
3982-182255-0009 WHEN MISTER NEWBERRY AND MISTER DICK OVEREND WERE YOUNG MEN WENT INTO CONGRESS FROM PURE PATRIOTISM THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS GRAFT OR CROOKEDNESS AS THEY BOTH ADMITTED IN THOSE DAYS AND AS FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE
3982-182255-0010 HERE THEIR VOICES WERE ALMOST HUSHED IN AWE WHY WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG THE UNITED STATES SENATE BUT NO NEITHER OF THEM COULD FIND A PHRASE BIG ENOUGH FOR THEIR MEANING THEY MERELY REPEATED
3982-182255-0011 AND THEN SHOOK THEIR HEADS AND TOOK LONG DRINKS OF WHISKEY AND SODA THEN NATURALLY SPEAKING OF THE ROTTENNESS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD LED THEM TO TALK OF THE ROTTENNESS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE
3982-182255-0012 HOW DIFFERENT FROM THE STATE LEGISLATURES THAT THEY REMEMBERED AS YOUNG MEN NOT MERELY DIFFERENT IN THE MATTER OF GRAFT BUT DIFFERENT SO MISTER NEWBERRY SAID IN THE CALIBRE OF THE MEN
3982-182255-0013 HE RECALLED HOW HE HAD BEEN TAKEN AS A BOY OF TWELVE BY HIS FATHER TO HEAR A DEBATE HE WOULD NEVER FORGET IT GIANTS HE SAID THAT WAS WHAT THEY WERE IN FACT THE THING WAS MORE LIKE A WITENAGEMOT
3982-182255-0014 THAN A LEGISLATURE HE SAID HE DISTINCTLY RECALLED A MAN WHOSE NAME HE DIDN'T RECOLLECT SPEAKING ON A QUESTION HE DIDN'T JUST REMEMBER WHAT EITHER FOR OR AGAINST
3982-182255-0015 IT THRILLED HIM HE WOULD NEVER FORGET IT IT STAYED IN HIS MEMORY AS IF IT WERE YESTERDAY BUT AS FOR THE PRESENT LEGISLATURE HERE MISTER DICK OVEREND SADLY NODDED ASSENT IN ADVANCE TO WHAT HE KNEW WAS COMING
3982-182255-0016 AS FOR THE PRESENT LEGISLATURE WELL MISTER NEWBERRY HAD HAD HE SAID OCCASION TO VISIT THE STATE CAPITAL A WEEK BEFORE IN CONNECTION WITH A RAILWAY BILL THAT HE WAS TRYING TO THAT IS THAT HE WAS ANXIOUS TO
3982-182255-0017 FROM SPEAKING OF THE CROOKEDNESS OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT MISTER NEWBERRY AND MISTER DICK OVEREND WERE LED TO TALK OF THE CROOKEDNESS OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT AND THEY BOTH AGREED AS ABOVE THAT THINGS WERE WORSE THAN IN RUSSIA WHAT SECRETLY IRRITATED THEM BOTH MOST
3982-182255-0018 WAS THAT THEY HAD LIVED AND DONE BUSINESS UNDER THIS INFERNAL CORRUPTION FOR THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS AND HADN'T NOTICED IT THEY HAD BEEN TOO BUSY THE FACT WAS THAT THEIR CONVERSATION REFLECTED NOT SO MUCH THEIR OWN ORIGINAL IDEAS
3982-182255-0019 AS A GENERAL WAVE OF FEELING THAT WAS PASSING OVER THE WHOLE COMMUNITY THERE HAD COME A MOMENT QUITE SUDDENLY IT SEEMED WHEN IT OCCURRED TO EVERYBODY AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE WHOLE GOVERNMENT OF THE CITY WAS ROTTEN THE WORD IS A STRONG ONE
3982-182255-0020 BUT IT IS THE ONE THAT WAS USED LOOK AT THE ALDERMEN THEY SAID ROTTEN LOOK AT THE CITY SOLICITOR ROTTEN AND AS FOR THE MAYOR HIMSELF PHEW THE THING CAME LIKE A WAVE
3982-182255-0021 EVERYBODY FELT IT AT ONCE PEOPLE WONDERED HOW ANY SANE INTELLIGENT COMMUNITY COULD TOLERATE THE PRESENCE OF A SET OF CORRUPT SCOUNDRELS LIKE THE TWENTY ALDERMEN OF THE CITY THEIR NAMES IT WAS SAID
3982-182255-0022 WERE SIMPLY A BYWORD THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES FOR RANK CRIMINAL CORRUPTION THIS WAS SAID SO WIDELY THAT EVERYBODY STARTED HUNTING THROUGH THE DAILY PAPERS TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHO IN BLAZES WERE ALDERMEN ANYHOW
3982-182255-0023 AND AS A MATTER OF FACT AT THE MOMENT WHEN THIS WAVE OF FEELING STRUCK THE CITY NOBODY KNEW OR CARED WHO WERE ALDERMEN ANYWAY TO TELL THE TRUTH THE ALDERMEN HAD BEEN MUCH THE SAME PERSONS FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS SOME WERE IN THE PRODUCE BUSINESS
3982-182255-0024 OTHERS WERE BUTCHERS TWO WERE GROCERS AND ALL OF THEM WORE BLUE CHECKERED WAISTCOATS AND RED TIES AND GOT UP AT SEVEN IN THE MORNING TO ATTEND THE VEGETABLE AND OTHER MARKETS NOBODY HAD EVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THEM THAT IS TO SAY NOBODY ON PLUTORIA AVENUE
3982-182255-0025 SOMETIMES ONE SAW A PICTURE IN THE PAPER AND WONDERED FOR A MOMENT WHO THE PERSON WAS BUT ON LOOKING MORE CLOSELY AND NOTICING WHAT WAS WRITTEN UNDER IT ONE SAID OH I SEE AN ALDERMAN AND TURNED TO SOMETHING ELSE WHOSE FUNERAL IS THAT
3982-182255-0026 A MAN WOULD SOMETIMES ASK ON PLUTORIA AVENUE OH JUST ONE OF THE CITY ALDERMEN
3982-182255-0027 OH I SEE I BEG YOUR PARDON I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE SOMEBODY IMPORTANT
3982-182255-0028 HOW AND WHERE THIS MOVEMENT OF INDIGNATION HAD STARTED PEOPLE SAID THAT IT WAS PART OF A NEW WAVE OF PUBLIC MORALITY THAT WAS SWEEPING OVER THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES CERTAINLY IT WAS BEING REMARKED IN ALMOST EVERY SECTION OF THE COUNTRY
3982-182255-0029 CHICAGO NEWSPAPERS WERE ATTRIBUTING ITS ORIGIN TO THE NEW VIGOUR AND THE FRESH IDEALS OF THE MIDDLE WEST IN BOSTON IT WAS SAID TO BE DUE TO A REVIVAL OF THE GRAND OLD NEW ENGLAND SPIRIT IN PHILADELPHIA
3982-182255-0030 THEY CALLED IT THE SPIRIT OF WILLIAM PENN IN THE SOUTH IT WAS SAID TO BE THE REASSERTION OF SOUTHERN CHIVALRY MAKING ITSELF FELT AGAINST THE GREED AND SELFISHNESS OF THE NORTH WHILE IN THE NORTH THEY RECOGNIZED IT AT ONCE
3982-182255-0031 AS A PROTEST AGAINST THE SLUGGISHNESS AND IGNORANCE OF THE SOUTH IN THE WEST THEY SPOKE OF IT AS A REVOLT AGAINST THE SPIRIT OF THE EAST AND IN THE EAST THEY CALLED IT A REACTION AGAINST THE LAWLESSNESS OF THE WEST BUT EVERYWHERE THEY HAILED IT AS A NEW SIGN OF THE GLORIOUS
3982-182255-0032 UNITY OF THE COUNTRY IF THEREFORE MISTER NEWBERRY AND MISTER OVEREND WERE FOUND TO BE DISCUSSING THE CORRUPT STATE OF THEIR CITY THEY ONLY SHARED IN THE NATIONAL SENTIMENTS OF THE MOMENT IN FACT IN THE SAME CITY HUNDREDS OF OTHER CITIZENS

3983-5371-0046 THAT EVENING AFTER DINNER MISS CARLYLE AND LORD MOUNT SEVERN SAT SIDE BY SIDE ON THE SAME SOFA COFFEE CUPS IN HAND MISS CARLYLE TURNED TO THE EARL WAS IT A POSITIVELY ASCERTAINED FACT THAT LADY ISABEL DIED THE EARL STARED WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
3983-5371-0047 HE THOUGHT IT THE STRANGEST QUESTION THAT EVER WAS ASKED HIM I SCARCELY UNDERSTAND YOU MISS CARLYLE DIED CERTAINLY SHE DIED WHEN THE RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT WAS COMMUNICATED TO YOU YOU MADE INQUIRY YOURSELF INTO ITS TRUTH ITS DETAILS I BELIEVE
3983-5371-0048 IT WAS MY DUTY TO DO SO THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE TO UNDERTAKE IT DID YOU ASCERTAIN POSITIVELY BEYOND ALL DOUBT THAT SHE DID DIE
3983-5371-0049 A PAUSE MISS CARLYLE WAS RUMINATING BUT SHE RETURNED TO THE CHARGE AS IF DIFFICULT TO BE CONVINCED YOU DEEM THAT THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBILITY OF AN ERROR YOU ARE SURE THAT SHE IS DEAD
3983-5371-0050 I AM AS SURE THAT SHE IS DEAD AS THAT WE ARE LIVING DECISIVELY REPLIED THE EARL AND HE SPOKE BUT ACCORDING TO HIS BELIEF WHEREFORE SHOULD YOU BE INQUIRING THIS A THOUGHT CAME OVER ME ONLY TO DAY TO WONDER WHETHER SHE WAS REALLY DEAD
3983-5371-0051 HAD ANY ERROR OCCURRED AT THAT TIME ANY FALSE REPORT OF HER DEATH I SHOULD SOON HAVE FOUND IT OUT BY HER DRAWING THE ANNUITY I SETTLED UPON HER IT HAS NEVER BEEN DRAWN SINCE BESIDES SHE WOULD HAVE WRITTEN TO ME AS AGREED UPON
3983-5371-0052 NO POOR THING SHE IS GONE BEYOND ALL DOUBT AND HAS TAKEN HER SINS WITH HER CONVINCING PROOFS AND MISS CARLYLE LENT HER EAR TO THEM THE FOLLOWING MORNING WHILE MADAME VINE WAS AT BREAKFAST MISTER CARLYLE ENTERED
3983-5371-0053 DO YOU ADMIT INTRUDERS HERE MADAME VINE CRIED HE WITH HIS SWEET SMILE AND ATTRACTIVE MANNER SHE AROSE HER FACE BURNING HER HEART THROBBING KEEP YOUR SEAT PRAY I HAVE BUT A MOMENT TO STAY SAID MISTER CARLYLE
3983-5371-0054 I HAVE COME TO ASK YOU HOW WILLIAM SEEMS THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE SHE MURMURED AND THEN SHE TOOK COURAGE AND SPOKE MORE OPENLY I UNDERSTOOD YOU TO SAY THE OTHER NIGHT SIR THAT HE SHOULD HAVE FURTHER ADVICE AY I WISH HIM TO GO OVER TO LYNNEBOROUGH TO DOCTOR MARTIN
3983-5371-0055 THE DRIVE I THINK WILL DO HIM GOOD REPLIED MISTER CARLYLE AND I WOULD LIKE YOU TO ACCOMPANY HIM IF YOU DO NOT MIND THE TROUBLE YOU CAN HAVE THE PONY CARRIAGE
3983-5371-0056 YOU CAN REMIND DOCTOR MARTIN THAT THE CHILD'S CONSTITUTION IS PRECISELY WHAT HIS MOTHER'S WAS CONTINUED MISTER CARLYLE A TINGE LIGHTENING HIS FACE IT MAY BE A GUIDE TO HIS TREATMENT HE SAID HIMSELF IT WAS WHEN HE ATTENDED HIM FOR AN ILLNESS A YEAR OR TWO AGO
3983-5371-0057 YES SIR HE CROSSED THE HALL ON HIS ENTRANCE TO THE BREAKFAST ROOM SHE TORE UPSTAIRS TO HER CHAMBER AND SANK DOWN IN AN AGONY OF TEARS AND DESPAIR OH TO LOVE HIM AS SHE DID NOW TO YEARN AFTER HIS AFFECTION WITH THIS PASSIONATE JEALOUS LONGING
3983-5371-0058 AND TO KNOW THAT THEY WERE SEPARATED FOR EVER AND EVER THAT SHE WAS WORSE TO HIM THAN NOTHING
40-121026-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE ABBE'S CHAMBER AFTER HAVING PASSED WITH TOLERABLE EASE THROUGH THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE WHICH HOWEVER DID NOT ADMIT OF THEIR HOLDING THEMSELVES ERECT THE TWO FRIENDS REACHED THE FURTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR
40-121026-0001 INTO WHICH THE ABBE'S CELL OPENED FROM THAT POINT THE PASSAGE BECAME MUCH NARROWER AND BARELY PERMITTED ONE TO CREEP THROUGH ON HANDS AND KNEES THE FLOOR OF THE ABBE'S CELL WAS PAVED AND IT HAD BEEN BY RAISING ONE OF THE STONES IN THE MOST OBSCURE CORNER
40-121026-0002 OF WHICH DANTES HAD WITNESSED THE COMPLETION AS HE ENTERED THE CHAMBER OF HIS FRIEND DANTES CAST AROUND ONE EAGER AND SEARCHING GLANCE IN QUEST OF THE EXPECTED MARVELS BUT NOTHING MORE THAN COMMON MET HIS VIEW IT IS WELL
40-121026-0003 SAID THE ABBE WE HAVE SOME HOURS BEFORE US IT IS NOW JUST A QUARTER PAST TWELVE O'CLOCK INSTINCTIVELY DANTES TURNED ROUND TO OBSERVE BY WHAT WATCH OR CLOCK THE ABBE HAD BEEN ABLE SO ACCURATELY TO SPECIFY THE HOUR
40-121026-0004 LOOK AT THIS RAY OF LIGHT WHICH ENTERS BY MY WINDOW SAID THE ABBE AND THEN OBSERVE THE LINES TRACED ON THE WALL WELL BY MEANS OF THESE LINES WHICH ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DOUBLE MOTION OF THE EARTH AND THE ELLIPSE IT DESCRIBES ROUND THE SUN
40-121026-0005 THAN IF I POSSESSED A WATCH FOR THAT MIGHT BE BROKEN OR DERANGED IN ITS MOVEMENTS WHILE THE SUN AND EARTH NEVER VARY IN THEIR APPOINTED PATHS THIS LAST EXPLANATION WAS WHOLLY LOST UPON DANTES WHO HAD ALWAYS IMAGINED
40-121026-0006 APPEARED TO HIM PERFECTLY IMPOSSIBLE EACH WORD THAT FELL FROM HIS COMPANION'S LIPS SEEMED FRAUGHT WITH THE MYSTERIES OF SCIENCE AS WORTHY OF DIGGING OUT AS THE GOLD AND DIAMONDS IN THE MINES OF GUZERAT AND GOLCONDA
40-121026-0007 WHICH HE COULD JUST RECOLLECT HAVING VISITED DURING A VOYAGE MADE IN HIS EARLIEST YOUTH
40-121026-0008 I AM ANXIOUS TO SEE YOUR TREASURES THE ABBE SMILED AND PROCEEDING TO THE DISUSED FIREPLACE RAISED BY THE HELP OF HIS CHISEL A LONG STONE WHICH HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN THE HEARTH BENEATH WHICH WAS A CAVITY OF CONSIDERABLE DEPTH
40-121026-0009 SERVING AS A SAFE DEPOSITORY OF THE ARTICLES MENTIONED TO DANTES
40-121026-0010 ASKED THE ABBE OH YOUR GREAT WORK ON THE MONARCHY OF ITALY
40-121026-0011 LAID ONE OVER THE OTHER LIKE FOLDS OF PAPYRUS THESE ROLLS CONSISTED OF SLIPS OF CLOTH ABOUT FOUR INCHES WIDE AND EIGHTEEN LONG THEY WERE ALL CAREFULLY NUMBERED AND CLOSELY COVERED WITH WRITING SO LEGIBLE THAT DANTES COULD EASILY READ IT
40-121026-0012 AS WELL AS MAKE OUT THE SENSE IT BEING IN ITALIAN
40-121026-0013 I WROTE THE WORD FINIS AT THE END OF THE SIXTY EIGHTH STRIP ABOUT A WEEK AGO I HAVE TORN UP TWO OF MY SHIRTS AND AS MANY HANDKERCHIEFS AS I WAS MASTER OF TO COMPLETE THE PRECIOUS PAGES
40-121026-0014 SHOULD I EVER GET OUT OF PRISON AND FIND IN ALL ITALY A PRINTER COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO PUBLISH WHAT I HAVE COMPOSED MY LITERARY REPUTATION IS FOREVER SECURED I SEE ANSWERED DANTES
40-121026-0015 NOW LET ME BEHOLD THE CURIOUS PENS WITH WHICH YOU HAVE WRITTEN YOUR WORK LOOK
40-121026-0016 SHOWING TO THE YOUNG MAN A SLENDER STICK ABOUT SIX INCHES LONG AND MUCH RESEMBLING THE SIZE OF THE HANDLE OF A FINE PAINTING BRUSH TO THE END OF WHICH WAS TIED BY A PIECE OF THREAD
40-121026-0017 AND DIVIDED AT THE NIB LIKE AN ORDINARY PEN DANTES EXAMINED IT WITH INTENSE ADMIRATION THEN LOOKED AROUND TO SEE THE INSTRUMENT WITH WHICH IT HAD BEEN SHAPED SO CORRECTLY INTO FORM AH YES SAID FARIA THE PENKNIFE
40-121026-0018 ONE COULD CUT AND THRUST DANTES EXAMINED THE VARIOUS ARTICLES SHOWN TO HIM WITH THE SAME ATTENTION THAT HE HAD BESTOWED ON THE CURIOSITIES AND STRANGE TOOLS EXHIBITED IN THE SHOPS AT MARSEILLES
40-121026-0019 AS THE WORKS OF THE SAVAGES IN THE SOUTH SEAS FROM WHENCE THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT BY THE DIFFERENT TRADING VESSELS AS FOR THE INK
40-121026-0020 I TOLD YOU HOW I MANAGED TO OBTAIN THAT AND I ONLY JUST MAKE IT FROM TIME TO TIME AS I REQUIRE IT ONE THING STILL PUZZLES ME OBSERVED DANTES AND THAT IS HOW YOU MANAGED TO DO ALL THIS BY DAYLIGHT
40-121026-0021 NIGHT WHY FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE ARE YOUR EYES LIKE CATS THAT YOU CAN SEE TO WORK IN THE DARK INDEED THEY ARE NOT BUT GOD HAS SUPPLIED MAN WITH THE INTELLIGENCE THAT ENABLES HIM TO OVERCOME THE LIMITATIONS OF NATURAL CONDITIONS
40-121026-0022 I FURNISHED MYSELF WITH A LIGHT
40-121026-0023 I SEPARATED THE FAT FROM THE MEAT SERVED TO ME MELTED IT AND SO MADE OIL HERE IS MY LAMP SO SAYING THE ABBE EXHIBITED A SORT OF TORCH VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE USED IN PUBLIC ILLUMINATIONS
40-121026-0024 AND MATCHES I PRETENDED THAT I HAD A DISORDER OF THE SKIN AND ASKED FOR A LITTLE SULPHUR WHICH WAS READILY SUPPLIED DANTES LAID THE DIFFERENT THINGS HE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT ON THE TABLE AND STOOD WITH HIS HEAD DROOPING ON HIS BREAST
40-121026-0025 AS THOUGH OVERWHELMED BY THE PERSEVERANCE AND STRENGTH OF FARIA'S MIND YOU HAVE NOT SEEN ALL YET CONTINUED FARIA FOR I DID NOT THINK IT WISE TO TRUST ALL MY TREASURES IN THE SAME HIDING PLACE LET US SHUT THIS ONE UP
40-121026-0026 THEY PUT THE STONE BACK IN ITS PLACE THE ABBE SPRINKLED A LITTLE DUST OVER IT TO CONCEAL THE TRACES OF ITS HAVING BEEN REMOVED RUBBED HIS FOOT WELL ON IT TO MAKE IT ASSUME THE SAME APPEARANCE AS THE OTHER AND THEN GOING TOWARDS HIS BED
40-121026-0027 WHO SUPPLIED YOU WITH THE MATERIALS FOR MAKING THIS WONDERFUL WORK I TORE UP SEVERAL OF MY SHIRTS AND RIPPED OUT THE SEAMS IN THE SHEETS OF MY BED DURING MY THREE YEARS IMPRISONMENT AT FENESTRELLE
40-121026-0028 SO THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FINISH MY WORK HERE AND WAS IT NOT DISCOVERED THAT YOUR SHEETS WERE UNHEMMED
40-121026-0029 I HEMMED THE EDGES OVER AGAIN WITH WHAT WITH THIS NEEDLE SAID THE ABBE AS OPENING HIS RAGGED VESTMENTS HE SHOWED DANTES A LONG SHARP FISH BONE WITH A SMALL PERFORATED EYE FOR THE THREAD A SMALL PORTION OF WHICH STILL REMAINED IN IT
40-121026-0030 I ONCE THOUGHT CONTINUED FARIA OF REMOVING THESE IRON BARS AND LETTING MYSELF DOWN FROM THE WINDOW WHICH AS YOU SEE IS SOMEWHAT WIDER THAN YOURS ALTHOUGH I SHOULD HAVE ENLARGED IT STILL MORE PREPARATORY TO MY FLIGHT
40-121026-0031 HOWEVER I DISCOVERED THAT I SHOULD MERELY HAVE DROPPED INTO A SORT OF INNER COURT AND I THEREFORE RENOUNCED THE PROJECT ALTOGETHER AS TOO FULL OF RISK AND DANGER NEVERTHELESS I CAREFULLY PRESERVED MY LADDER
40-121026-0032 AND WHICH SUDDEN CHANCE FREQUENTLY BRINGS ABOUT WHILE AFFECTING TO BE DEEPLY ENGAGED IN EXAMINING THE LADDER THE MIND OF DANTES WAS IN FACT BUSILY OCCUPIED BY THE IDEA
40-121026-0033 THAT A PERSON SO INTELLIGENT INGENIOUS AND CLEAR SIGHTED AS THE ABBE MIGHT PROBABLY BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE DARK MYSTERY OF HIS OWN MISFORTUNES WHERE HE HIMSELF COULD SEE NOTHING
40-121026-0034 WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF ASKED THE ABBE SMILINGLY IMPUTING THE DEEP ABSTRACTION IN WHICH HIS VISITOR WAS PLUNGED TO THE EXCESS OF HIS AWE AND WONDER I WAS REFLECTING IN THE FIRST PLACE REPLIED DANTES
40-121026-0035 UPON THE ENORMOUS DEGREE OF INTELLIGENCE AND ABILITY YOU MUST HAVE EMPLOYED TO REACH THE HIGH PERFECTION TO WHICH YOU HAVE ATTAINED WHAT WOULD YOU NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IF YOU HAD BEEN FREE POSSIBLY NOTHING AT ALL THE OVERFLOW OF MY BRAIN WOULD PROBABLY
40-121026-0036 IN A STATE OF FREEDOM HAVE EVAPORATED IN A THOUSAND FOLLIES MISFORTUNE IS NEEDED TO BRING TO LIGHT THE TREASURES OF THE HUMAN INTELLECT COMPRESSION IS NEEDED TO EXPLODE GUNPOWDER CAPTIVITY HAS BROUGHT MY MENTAL FACULTIES TO A FOCUS
40-121026-0037 AND YOU ARE WELL AWARE THAT FROM THE COLLISION OF CLOUDS ELECTRICITY IS PRODUCED FROM ELECTRICITY LIGHTNING FROM LIGHTNING ILLUMINATION NO REPLIED DANTES I KNOW NOTHING
40-121026-0038 YOU MUST BE BLESSED INDEED TO POSSESS THE KNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE THE ABBE SMILED WELL SAID HE BUT YOU HAD ANOTHER SUBJECT FOR YOUR THOUGHTS DID YOU NOT SAY SO JUST NOW I DID
40-121026-0039 AS YET BUT ONE OF THEM LET ME HEAR THE OTHER IT WAS THIS THAT WHILE YOU HAD RELATED TO ME ALL THE PARTICULARS OF YOUR PAST LIFE YOU WERE PERFECTLY UNACQUAINTED WITH MINE YOUR LIFE MY YOUNG FRIEND HAS NOT BEEN OF SUFFICIENT LENGTH
40-121026-0040 I WOULD FAIN FIX THE SOURCE OF IT ON MAN THAT I MAY NO LONGER VENT REPROACHES UPON HEAVEN
40-121026-0041 MY FATHER AND MERCEDES COME SAID THE ABBE CLOSING HIS HIDING PLACE AND PUSHING THE BED BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL SITUATION LET ME HEAR YOUR STORY DANTES OBEYED AND COMMENCED WHAT HE CALLED HIS HISTORY
40-121026-0042 BUT WHICH CONSISTED ONLY OF THE ACCOUNT OF A VOYAGE TO INDIA AND TWO OR THREE VOYAGES TO THE LEVANT UNTIL HE ARRIVED AT THE RECITAL OF HIS LAST CRUISE WITH THE DEATH OF CAPTAIN LECLERE AND THE RECEIPT OF A PACKET TO BE DELIVERED BY HIMSELF TO THE GRAND MARSHAL
40-121026-0043 HIS INTERVIEW WITH THAT PERSONAGE AND HIS RECEIVING IN PLACE OF THE PACKET BROUGHT A LETTER ADDRESSED TO A MONSIEUR NOIRTIER HIS ARRIVAL AT MARSEILLES AND INTERVIEW WITH HIS FATHER HIS AFFECTION FOR MERCEDES AND THEIR NUPTUAL FEAST
40-121026-0044 HIS ARREST AND SUBSEQUENT EXAMINATION HIS TEMPORARY DETENTION AT THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE AND HIS FINAL IMPRISONMENT IN THE CHATEAU D'IF FROM THIS POINT EVERYTHING WAS A BLANK TO DANTES HE KNEW NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE LENGTH OF TIME HE HAD BEEN IMPRISONED
40-222-0000 CATHERINE WAS COMPLETELY AWAKENED HENRY'S ADDRESS SHORT AS IT HAD BEEN HAD MORE THOROUGHLY OPENED HER EYES TO THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF HER LATE FANCIES THAN ALL THEIR SEVERAL DISAPPOINTMENTS HAD DONE
40-222-0001 MOST BITTERLY DID SHE CRY IT WAS NOT ONLY WITH HERSELF THAT SHE WAS SUNK BUT WITH HENRY HER FOLLY WHICH NOW SEEMED EVEN CRIMINAL WAS ALL EXPOSED TO HIM AND HE MUST DESPISE HER FOREVER
40-222-0002 THE LIBERTY WHICH HER IMAGINATION HAD DARED TO TAKE WITH THE CHARACTER OF HIS FATHER COULD HE EVER FORGIVE IT THE ABSURDITY OF HER CURIOSITY AND HER FEARS COULD THEY EVER BE FORGOTTEN
40-222-0003 SHE HATED HERSELF MORE THAN SHE COULD EXPRESS HE HAD SHE THOUGHT HE HAD ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE THIS FATAL MORNING SHOWN SOMETHING LIKE AFFECTION FOR HER BUT NOW
40-222-0004 IN SHORT SHE MADE HERSELF AS MISERABLE AS POSSIBLE FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR WENT DOWN WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK FIVE WITH A BROKEN HEART AND COULD SCARCELY GIVE AN INTELLIGIBLE ANSWER TO ELEANOR'S INQUIRY IF SHE WAS WELL
40-222-0005 THE FORMIDABLE HENRY SOON FOLLOWED HER INTO THE ROOM AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO HER WAS THAT HE PAID HER RATHER MORE ATTENTION THAN USUAL CATHERINE HAD NEVER WANTED COMFORT MORE AND HE LOOKED AS IF HE WAS AWARE OF IT
40-222-0006 THE EVENING WORE AWAY WITH NO ABATEMENT OF THIS SOOTHING POLITENESS AND HER SPIRITS WERE GRADUALLY RAISED TO A MODEST TRANQUILLITY SHE DID NOT LEARN EITHER TO FORGET OR DEFEND THE PAST
40-222-0007 BUT SHE LEARNED TO HOPE THAT IT WOULD NEVER TRANSPIRE FARTHER AND THAT IT MIGHT NOT COST HER HENRY'S ENTIRE REGARD HER THOUGHTS BEING STILL CHIEFLY FIXED ON WHAT SHE HAD WITH SUCH CAUSELESS TERROR FELT AND DONE NOTHING COULD SHORTLY BE CLEARER
40-222-0008 THAN THAT IT HAD BEEN ALL A VOLUNTARY SELF CREATED DELUSION EACH TRIFLING CIRCUMSTANCE RECEIVING IMPORTANCE FROM AN IMAGINATION RESOLVED ON ALARM AND EVERYTHING FORCED TO BEND TO ONE PURPOSE BY A MIND WHICH
40-222-0009 LONG BEFORE HER QUITTING BATH AND IT SEEMED AS IF THE WHOLE MIGHT BE TRACED TO THE INFLUENCE OF THAT SORT OF READING WHICH SHE HAD THERE INDULGED
40-222-0010 CHARMING AS WERE ALL MISSUS RADCLIFFE'S WORKS AND CHARMING EVEN AS WERE THE WORKS OF ALL HER IMITATORS IT WAS NOT IN THEM PERHAPS THAT HUMAN NATURE AT LEAST IN THE MIDLAND COUNTIES OF ENGLAND WAS TO BE LOOKED FOR
40-222-0011 AND EVEN OF THAT IF HARD PRESSED WOULD HAVE YIELDED THE NORTHERN AND WESTERN EXTREMITIES BUT IN THE CENTRAL PART OF ENGLAND THERE WAS SURELY SOME SECURITY FOR THE EXISTENCE EVEN OF A WIFE NOT BELOVED IN THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND THE MANNERS OF THE AGE
40-222-0012 MURDER WAS NOT TOLERATED SERVANTS WERE NOT SLAVES AND NEITHER POISON NOR SLEEPING POTIONS TO BE PROCURED LIKE RHUBARB FROM EVERY DRUGGIST AMONG THE ALPS AND PYRENEES PERHAPS THERE WERE NO MIXED CHARACTERS
40-222-0013 THERE SUCH AS WERE NOT AS SPOTLESS AS AN ANGEL MIGHT HAVE THE DISPOSITIONS OF A FIEND BUT IN ENGLAND IT WAS NOT SO AMONG THE ENGLISH SHE BELIEVED IN THEIR HEARTS AND HABITS
40-222-0014 UPON THIS CONVICTION SHE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF EVEN IN HENRY AND ELEANOR TILNEY SOME SLIGHT IMPERFECTION MIGHT HEREAFTER APPEAR
40-222-0015 AND UPON THIS CONVICTION SHE NEED NOT FEAR TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOME ACTUAL SPECKS IN THE CHARACTER OF THEIR FATHER WHO THOUGH CLEARED FROM THE GROSSLY INJURIOUS SUSPICIONS WHICH SHE MUST EVER BLUSH TO HAVE ENTERTAINED SHE DID BELIEVE
40-222-0016 UPON SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO BE NOT PERFECTLY AMIABLE HER MIND MADE UP ON THESE SEVERAL POINTS AND HER RESOLUTION FORMED OF ALWAYS JUDGING AND ACTING IN FUTURE WITH THE GREATEST GOOD SENSE
40-222-0017 SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO FORGIVE HERSELF AND BE HAPPIER THAN EVER AND THE LENIENT HAND OF TIME DID MUCH FOR HER BY INSENSIBLE GRADATIONS IN THE COURSE OF ANOTHER DAY HENRY'S ASTONISHING GENEROSITY
40-222-0018 AND NOBLENESS OF CONDUCT IN NEVER ALLUDING IN THE SLIGHTEST WAY TO WHAT HAD PASSED WAS OF THE GREATEST ASSISTANCE TO HER AND SOONER THAN SHE COULD HAVE SUPPOSED IT POSSIBLE IN THE BEGINNING OF HER DISTRESS HER SPIRITS BECAME ABSOLUTELY COMFORTABLE
40-222-0019 AND CAPABLE AS HERETOFORE OF CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT BY ANYTHING HE SAID THERE WERE STILL SOME SUBJECTS INDEED UNDER WHICH SHE BELIEVED THEY MUST ALWAYS TREMBLE THE MENTION OF A CHEST OR A CABINET FOR INSTANCE
40-222-0020 AND SHE DID NOT LOVE THE SIGHT OF JAPAN IN ANY SHAPE BUT EVEN SHE COULD ALLOW THAT AN OCCASIONAL MEMENTO OF PAST FOLLY HOWEVER PAINFUL MIGHT NOT BE WITHOUT USE
40-222-0021 THE ANXIETIES OF COMMON LIFE BEGAN SOON TO SUCCEED TO THE ALARMS OF ROMANCE HER DESIRE OF HEARING FROM ISABELLA GREW EVERY DAY GREATER SHE WAS QUITE IMPATIENT TO KNOW HOW THE BATH WORLD WENT ON AND HOW THE ROOMS WERE ATTENDED
40-222-0022 AND ESPECIALLY WAS SHE ANXIOUS TO BE ASSURED OF ISABELLA'S HAVING MATCHED SOME FINE NETTING COTTON ON WHICH SHE HAD LEFT HER INTENT AND OF HER CONTINUING ON THE BEST TERMS WITH JAMES
40-222-0023 HER ONLY DEPENDENCE FOR INFORMATION OF ANY KIND WAS ON ISABELLA JAMES HAD PROTESTED AGAINST WRITING TO HER TILL HIS RETURN TO OXFORD AND MISSUS ALLEN HAD GIVEN HER NO HOPES OF A LETTER TILL SHE HAD GOT BACK TO FULLERTON
40-222-0024 SHE THANKED HIM AS HEARTILY AS IF HE HAD WRITTEN IT HIMSELF TIS ONLY FROM JAMES HOWEVER AS SHE LOOKED AT THE DIRECTION SHE OPENED IT IT WAS FROM OXFORD AND TO THIS PURPOSE DEAR CATHERINE
40-222-0025 THOUGH GOD KNOWS WITH LITTLE INCLINATION FOR WRITING I THINK IT MY DUTY TO TELL YOU THAT EVERYTHING IS AT AN END BETWEEN MISS THORPE AND ME I LEFT HER AND BATH YESTERDAY NEVER TO SEE EITHER AGAIN
40-222-0026 I SHALL NOT ENTER INTO PARTICULARS THEY WOULD ONLY PAIN YOU MORE YOU WILL SOON HEAR ENOUGH FROM ANOTHER QUARTER TO KNOW WHERE LIES THE BLAME
40-222-0027 THANK GOD I AM UNDECEIVED IN TIME BUT IT IS A HEAVY BLOW AFTER MY FATHER'S CONSENT HAD BEEN SO KINDLY GIVEN BUT NO MORE OF THIS SHE HAS MADE ME MISERABLE FOREVER
40-222-0028 LET ME SOON HEAR FROM YOU DEAR CATHERINE YOU ARE MY ONLY FRIEND YOUR LOVE I DO BUILD UPON I WISH YOUR VISIT AT NORTHANGER MAY BE OVER BEFORE CAPTAIN TILNEY MAKES HIS ENGAGEMENT KNOWN
40-222-0029 OR YOU WILL BE UNCOMFORTABLY CIRCUMSTANCED POOR THORPE IS IN TOWN I DREAD THE SIGHT OF HIM HIS HONEST HEART WOULD FEEL SO MUCH I HAVE WRITTEN TO HIM AND MY FATHER HER DUPLICITY HURTS ME MORE THAN ALL
40-222-0030 TILL THE VERY LAST IF I REASONED WITH HER SHE DECLARED HERSELF AS MUCH ATTACHED TO ME AS EVER
40-222-0031 I AM ASHAMED TO THINK HOW LONG I BORE WITH IT BUT IF EVER MAN HAD REASON TO BELIEVE HIMSELF LOVED I WAS THAT MAN I CANNOT UNDERSTAND EVEN NOW
40-222-0032 WHAT SHE WOULD BE AT FOR THERE COULD BE NO NEED OF MY BEING PLAYED OFF TO MAKE HER SECURE OF TILNEY WE PARTED AT LAST BY MUTUAL CONSENT HAPPY FOR ME HAD WE NEVER MET
40-222-0033 DEAREST CATHERINE BEWARE HOW YOU GIVE YOUR HEART
40-222-0034 AND SHORT EXCLAMATIONS OF SORROWING WONDER DECLARED HER TO BE RECEIVING UNPLEASANT NEWS AND HENRY EARNESTLY WATCHING HER THROUGH THE WHOLE LETTER SAW PLAINLY THAT IT ENDED NO BETTER THAN IT BEGAN HE WAS PREVENTED HOWEVER
40-222-0035 FROM EVEN LOOKING HIS SURPRISE BY HIS FATHER'S ENTRANCE THEY WENT TO BREAKFAST DIRECTLY BUT CATHERINE COULD HARDLY EAT ANYTHING TEARS FILLED HER EYES AND EVEN RAN DOWN HER CHEEKS AS SHE SAT THE LETTER WAS ONE MOMENT IN HER HAND
40-222-0036 THEN IN HER LAP AND THEN IN HER POCKET AND SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE KNEW NOT WHAT SHE DID THE GENERAL BETWEEN HIS COCOA AND HIS NEWSPAPER HAD LUCKILY NO LEISURE FOR NOTICING HER BUT TO THE OTHER TWO HER DISTRESS WAS EQUALLY VISIBLE
40-222-0037 AS SOON AS SHE DARED LEAVE THE TABLE SHE HURRIED AWAY TO HER OWN ROOM BUT THE HOUSEMAIDS WERE BUSY IN IT AND SHE WAS OBLIGED TO COME DOWN AGAIN SHE TURNED INTO THE DRAWING ROOM FOR PRIVACY BUT HENRY AND ELEANOR HAD LIKEWISE RETREATED THITHER
40-222-0038 AND WERE AT THAT MOMENT DEEP IN CONSULTATION ABOUT HER SHE DREW BACK TRYING TO BEG THEIR PARDON BUT WAS WITH GENTLE VIOLENCE FORCED TO RETURN AND THE OTHERS WITHDREW
40-222-0039 AFTER ELEANOR HAD AFFECTIONATELY EXPRESSED A WISH OF BEING OF USE OR COMFORT TO HER AFTER HALF AN HOUR'S FREE INDULGENCE OF GRIEF AND REFLECTION CATHERINE FELT EQUAL TO ENCOUNTERING HER FRIENDS
40-222-0040 SUCH A FRIEND AS ISABELLA HAD BEEN TO HER AND THEN THEIR OWN BROTHER SO CLOSELY CONCERNED IN IT SHE BELIEVED SHE MUST WAIVE THE SUBJECT ALTOGETHER HENRY AND ELEANOR WERE BY THEMSELVES IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM AND EACH AS SHE ENTERED IT
40-222-0041 LOOKED AT HER ANXIOUSLY CATHERINE TOOK HER PLACE AT THE TABLE AND AFTER A SHORT SILENCE ELEANOR SAID NO BAD NEWS FROM FULLERTON I HOPE MISTER AND MISSUS MORLAND YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS I HOPE THEY ARE NONE OF THEM ILL
40-222-0042 NO I THANK YOU SIGHING AS SHE SPOKE THEY ARE ALL VERY WELL MY LETTER WAS FROM MY BROTHER AT OXFORD NOTHING FURTHER WAS SAID FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN SPEAKING THROUGH HER TEARS SHE ADDED
40-222-0043 I DO NOT THINK I SHALL EVER WISH FOR A LETTER AGAIN I AM SORRY SAID HENRY CLOSING THE BOOK HE HAD JUST OPENED IF I HAD SUSPECTED THE LETTER OF CONTAINING ANYTHING UNWELCOME I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT WITH VERY DIFFERENT FEELINGS
40-222-0044 IT CONTAINED SOMETHING WORSE THAN ANYBODY COULD SUPPOSE POOR JAMES IS SO UNHAPPY YOU WILL SOON KNOW WHY TO HAVE SO KIND HEARTED SO AFFECTIONATE A SISTER REPLIED HENRY WARMLY MUST BE A COMFORT TO HIM UNDER ANY DISTRESS
40-222-0045 I HAVE ONE FAVOUR TO BEG SAID CATHERINE SHORTLY AFTERWARDS IN AN AGITATED MANNER THAT IF YOUR BROTHER SHOULD BE COMING HERE YOU WILL GIVE ME NOTICE OF IT THAT I MAY GO AWAY OUR BROTHER FREDERICK YES
40-222-0046 I AM SURE I SHOULD BE VERY SORRY TO LEAVE YOU SO SOON BUT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED THAT WOULD MAKE IT VERY DREADFUL FOR ME TO BE IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH CAPTAIN TILNEY ELEANOR'S WORK WAS SUSPENDED WHILE SHE GAZED WITH INCREASING ASTONISHMENT
40-222-0047 BUT HENRY BEGAN TO SUSPECT THE TRUTH AND SOMETHING IN WHICH MISS THORPE'S NAME WAS INCLUDED PASSED HIS LIPS HOW QUICK YOU ARE CRIED CATHERINE YOU HAVE GUESSED IT I DECLARE AND YET WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT IT IN BATH

40-222-0055 WHAT WAS HER FATHER A LAWYER I BELIEVE THEY LIVE AT PUTNEY ARE THEY A WEALTHY FAMILY NO NOT VERY I DO NOT BELIEVE ISABELLA HAS ANY FORTUNE AT ALL BUT THAT WILL NOT SIGNIFY IN YOUR FAMILY
40-222-0056 WOULD IT BE TO PROMOTE HIS HAPPINESS TO ENABLE HIM TO MARRY SUCH A GIRL SHE MUST BE AN UNPRINCIPLED ONE OR SHE COULD NOT HAVE USED YOUR BROTHER SO AND HOW STRANGE AN INFATUATION ON FREDERICK'S SIDE A GIRL

403-126855-0001 THE BRIDGE OF APES QUEEN ERMINTRUDE HAD NEVER IN HER LIFE SEEN HER HUSBAND SO TERRIBLE AS HE GOT THAT NIGHT HE GNASHED HIS TEETH WITH RAGE

403-126855-0003 THEN HE MADE ALL HIS SERVANTS GO TOO HIS COOKS AND HIS GARDENERS AND HIS BARBER AND PRINCE BUMPO'S TUTOR EVEN THE QUEEN WHO WAS TIRED FROM DANCING IN A PAIR OF TIGHT SHOES
403-126855-0004 WAS PACKED OFF TO HELP THE SOLDIERS IN THEIR SEARCH ALL THIS TIME THE DOCTOR AND HIS ANIMALS WERE RUNNING THROUGH THE FOREST TOWARDS THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS AS FAST AS THEY COULD GO GUB GUB
403-126855-0005 WITH HIS SHORT LEGS SOON GOT TIRED AND THE DOCTOR HAD TO CARRY HIM WHICH MADE IT PRETTY HARD WHEN THEY HAD THE TRUNK AND THE HAND BAG WITH THEM AS WELL THE KING OF THE JOLLIGINKI
403-126855-0006 THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASY FOR HIS ARMY TO FIND THEM BECAUSE THE DOCTOR WAS IN A STRANGE LAND AND WOULD NOT KNOW HIS WAY BUT HE WAS WRONG BECAUSE THE MONKEY CHEE CHEE KNEW ALL THE PATHS THROUGH THE JUNGLE BETTER EVEN THAN THE KING'S MEN DID
403-126855-0007 AND HE LED THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS TO THE VERY THICKEST PART OF THE FOREST A PLACE WHERE NO MAN HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE AND HID THEM ALL IN A BIG HOLLOW TREE BETWEEN HIGH ROCKS
403-126855-0008 SO THERE THEY STAYED THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH THEY OFTEN HEARD THE KING'S MEN SEARCHING AND TALKING IN THE JUNGLE ROUND ABOUT BUT THEY WERE QUITE SAFE FOR NO ONE KNEW OF THAT HIDING PLACE BUT CHEE CHEE NOT EVEN THE OTHER MONKEYS
403-126855-0009 AT LAST WHEN DAYLIGHT BEGAN TO COME THROUGH THE THICK LEAVES OVERHEAD THEY HEARD QUEEN ERMINTRUDE SAYING IN A VERY TIRED VOICE THAT IT WAS NO USE LOOKING ANY MORE THAT THEY MIGHT AS WELL GO BACK AND GET SOME SLEEP
403-126855-0010 AND THEY SET OFF FOR THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS IT WAS A LONG LONG WAY AND THEY OFTEN GOT VERY TIRED ESPECIALLY GUB GUB BUT WHEN HE CRIED THEY GAVE HIM MILK OUT OF THE COCOANUTS
403-126855-0011 CHEE CHEE AND POLYNESIA ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE ABLE TO GET IT FOR THEM OR SOMETHING LIKE IT THEY EVEN GOT THE DOCTOR SOME TOBACCO ONE DAY WHEN HE HAD FINISHED WHAT HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM AND WANTED TO SMOKE
403-126855-0012 AND ENJOYED THE LIFE OF TRAVEL VERY MUCH BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS GLAD WHEN THE NIGHT CAME AND THEY STOPPED FOR THEIR RESTING TIME THEN THE DOCTOR USED TO MAKE A LITTLE FIRE OF STICKS
403-126855-0013 THEY WOULD SIT ROUND IT IN A RING LISTENING TO POLYNESIA SINGING SONGS ABOUT THE SEA OR TO CHEE CHEE TELLING STORIES OF THE JUNGLE AND MANY OF THE TALES THAT CHEE CHEE TOLD WERE VERY INTERESTING
403-126855-0014 BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THE MONKEYS HAD NO HISTORY BOOKS OF THEIR OWN BEFORE DOCTOR DOLITTLE CAME TO WRITE THEM FOR THEM THEY REMEMBER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS BY TELLING STORIES TO THEIR CHILDREN
403-126855-0015 OF THE DAYS WHEN MEN DRESSED IN BEAR SKINS AND LIVED IN HOLES IN THE ROCK AND ATE THEIR MUTTON RAW BECAUSE THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT COOKING WAS HAVING NEVER SEEN A FIRE
403-126855-0016 AND HE TOLD THEM OF THE GREAT MAMMOTHS AND LIZARDS AS LONG AS A TRAIN THAT WANDERED OVER THE MOUNTAINS IN THOSE TIMES NIBBLING FROM THE TREE TOPS AND OFTEN THEY GOT SO INTERESTED LISTENING
403-126855-0017 THEY WERE STILL BEING FOLLOWED BY THE KING'S MEN IF CHEE CHEE HAD KNOWN THIS HE WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE HIDDEN THEM AGAIN BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW IT ONE DAY CHEE CHEE CLIMBED UP A HIGH ROCK AND LOOKED OUT OVER THE TREE TOPS
403-126855-0018 THESE MONKEYS MADE A TREMENDOUS NOISE CHEERING AND WAVING LEAVES AND SWINGING OUT OF THE BRANCHES TO GREET HIM THEY WANTED TO CARRY HIS BAG AND HIS TRUNK AND EVERYTHING HE HAD AND ONE OF THE BIGGER ONES EVEN CARRIED GUB GUB
403-126855-0019 HAD HEARD THE NOISE OF THE MONKEYS CHEERING AND THEY AT LAST KNEW WHERE THE DOCTOR WAS AND HASTENED ON TO CATCH HIM THE BIG MONKEY CARRYING GUB GUB WAS COMING ALONG BEHIND SLOWLY
403-126855-0020 AND HE SAW THE CAPTAIN OF THE ARMY SNEAKING THROUGH THE TREES SO HE HURRIED AFTER THE DOCTOR AND TOLD HIM TO RUN THEN THEY ALL RAN HARDER THAN THEY HAD EVER RUN IN THEIR LIVES AND THE KING'S MEN
403-126855-0021 COMING AFTER THEM BEGAN TO RUN TOO AND THE CAPTAIN RAN HARDEST OF ALL THEN THE DOCTOR TRIPPED OVER HIS MEDICINE BAG AND FELL DOWN IN THE MUD AND THE CAPTAIN THOUGHT HE WOULD SURELY CATCH HIM THIS TIME
403-126855-0022 BUT THE CAPTAIN HAD VERY LONG EARS THOUGH HIS HAIR WAS VERY SHORT AND AS HE SPRANG FORWARD TO TAKE HOLD OF THE DOCTOR ONE OF HIS EARS CAUGHT FAST IN A TREE
403-126855-0023 BY THIS TIME THE DOCTOR HAD PICKED HIMSELF UP AND ON THEY WENT AGAIN RUNNING AND RUNNING AND CHEE CHEE SHOUTED IT'S ALL RIGHT WE HAVEN'T FAR TO GO NOW
403-126855-0024 BUT BEFORE THEY COULD GET INTO THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS THEY CAME TO A STEEP CLIFF WITH A RIVER FLOWING BELOW THIS WAS THE END OF THE KINGDOM OF JOLLIGINKI
403-126855-0025 AND THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE ACROSS THE RIVER AND JIP THE DOG LOOKED DOWN OVER THE EDGE OF THE STEEP STEEP CLIFF AND SAID GOLLY HOW ARE WE EVER GOING TO GET ACROSS
403-126855-0026 OH DEAR SAID GUB GUB THE KING'S MEN ARE QUITE CLOSE NOW LOOK AT THEM I AM AFRAID WE ARE GOING TO BE TAKEN BACK TO PRISON AGAIN AND HE BEGAN TO WEEP
403-126855-0027 THEY'VE GOT THE CAPTAIN LOOSE AND HE'S COMING ON LIKE A DEER GET LIVELY
403-126855-0028 WAS A BRIDGE ALL READY FOR HIM MADE OF LIVING MONKEYS FOR WHILE HIS BACK WAS TURNED THE MONKEYS QUICK AS A FLASH HAD MADE THEMSELVES INTO A BRIDGE
403-126855-0029 AND THE BIG ONE SHOUTED TO THE DOCTOR WALK OVER WALK OVER ALL OF YOU HURRY GUB GUB WAS A BIT SCARED WALKING ON SUCH A NARROW BRIDGE AT THAT DIZZY HEIGHT
403-126855-0030 AND SO DID ALL OF THEM JOHN DOLITTLE WAS THE LAST TO CROSS AND JUST AS HE WAS GETTING TO THE OTHER SIDE THE KING'S MEN CAME RUSHING UP TO THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF THEN THEY SHOOK THEIR FISTS AND YELLED WITH RAGE
403-126855-0031 MANY GREAT EXPLORERS AND GRAY BEARDED NATURALISTS HAVE LAIN LONG WEEKS HIDDEN IN THE JUNGLE WAITING TO SEE THE MONKEYS DO THAT TRICK BUT WE NEVER LET A WHITE MAN GET A GLIMPSE OF IT BEFORE YOU ARE THE FIRST TO SEE THE FAMOUS BRIDGE OF APES
403-128339-0000 PUBLIC PROSECUTOR AND DETERMINED JURY SAT EVERY DAY THEIR LISTS WENT FORTH EVERY EVENING
403-128339-0001 COME OUT AND LISTEN TO THE EVENING PAPER YOU INSIDE THERE CHARLES EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY SO AT LAST BEGAN THE EVENING PAPER AT LA FORCE
403-128339-0002 CHARLES EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY HAD REASON TO KNOW THE USAGE HE HAD SEEN HUNDREDS PASS AWAY SO
403-128339-0003 AND TWO HAD ALREADY BEEN GUILLOTINED AND FORGOTTEN THE LIST WAS READ IN THE VAULTED CHAMBER WHERE DARNAY HAD SEEN THE ASSOCIATED PRISONERS ON THE NIGHT OF HIS ARRIVAL EVERY ONE OF THOSE HAD PERISHED IN THE MASSACRE
403-128339-0004 EVERY HUMAN CREATURE HE HAD SINCE CARED FOR AND PARTED WITH HAD DIED ON THE SCAFFOLD THERE WERE HURRIED WORDS OF FAREWELL AND KINDNESS BUT THE PARTING WAS SOON OVER IT WAS THE INCIDENT OF EVERY DAY
403-128339-0005 AND A LITTLE CONCERT FOR THAT EVENING THEY CROWDED TO THE GRATES AND SHED TEARS THERE BUT TWENTY PLACES IN THE PROJECTED ENTERTAINMENTS HAD TO BE REFILLED AND THE TIME WAS AT BEST SHORT TO THE LOCK UP HOUR
403-128339-0006 WHEN THE COMMON ROOMS AND CORRIDORS WOULD BE DELIVERED OVER TO THE GREAT DOGS WHO KEPT WATCH THERE THROUGH THE NIGHT THE PRISONERS WERE FAR FROM INSENSIBLE OR UNFEELING THEIR WAYS AROSE OUT OF THE CONDITION OF THE TIME SIMILARLY
403-128339-0007 BUT A WILD INFECTION OF THE WILDLY SHAKEN PUBLIC MIND IN SEASONS OF PESTILENCE SOME OF US WILL HAVE A SECRET ATTRACTION TO THE DISEASE A TERRIBLE PASSING INCLINATION TO DIE OF IT
403-128339-0008 AND ALL OF US HAVE LIKE WONDERS HIDDEN IN OUR BREASTS ONLY NEEDING CIRCUMSTANCES TO EVOKE THEM THE PASSAGE TO THE CONCIERGERIE WAS SHORT AND DARK
403-128339-0009 THE NIGHT IN ITS VERMIN HAUNTED CELLS WAS LONG AND COLD NEXT DAY FIFTEEN PRISONERS WERE PUT TO THE BAR BEFORE CHARLES DARNAY'S NAME WAS CALLED ALL THE FIFTEEN WERE CONDEMNED
403-128339-0010 SOME DAGGERS SOME ATE AND DRANK AS THEY LOOKED ON MANY KNITTED AMONG THESE LAST WAS ONE WITH A SPARE PIECE OF KNITTING UNDER HER ARM AS SHE WORKED SHE WAS IN A FRONT ROW BY THE SIDE OF A MAN
403-128339-0011 BUT WHAT HE MOST NOTICED IN THE TWO FIGURES WAS THAT ALTHOUGH THEY WERE POSTED AS CLOSE TO HIMSELF AS THEY COULD BE THEY NEVER LOOKED TOWARDS HIM THEY SEEMED TO BE WAITING FOR SOMETHING WITH A DOGGED DETERMINATION
403-128339-0012 AND THEY LOOKED AT THE JURY BUT AT NOTHING ELSE UNDER THE PRESIDENT SAT DOCTOR MANETTE IN HIS USUAL QUIET DRESS AS WELL AS THE PRISONER COULD SEE HE AND MISTER LORRY WERE THE ONLY MEN THERE UNCONNECTED WITH THE TRIBUNAL
403-128339-0013 WHO WORE THEIR USUAL CLOTHES AND HAD NOT ASSUMED THE COARSE GARB
403-128339-0014 WHOSE LIFE WAS FORFEIT TO THE REPUBLIC UNDER THE DECREE WHICH BANISHED ALL EMIGRANTS ON PAIN OF DEATH IT WAS NOTHING THAT THE DECREE BORE DATE SINCE HIS RETURN TO FRANCE THERE HE WAS AND THERE WAS THE DECREE
403-128339-0015 HE HAD BEEN TAKEN IN FRANCE AND HIS HEAD WAS DEMANDED TAKE OFF HIS HEAD CRIED THE AUDIENCE AN ENEMY TO THE REPUBLIC THE PRESIDENT RANG HIS BELL TO SILENCE THOSE CRIES
403-128339-0016 UNDOUBTEDLY IT WAS WAS HE NOT AN EMIGRANT THEN WHAT DID HE CALL HIMSELF NOT AN EMIGRANT HE HOPED WITHIN THE SENSE AND SPIRIT OF THE LAW WHY NOT THE PRESIDENT DESIRED TO KNOW
403-128339-0017 BECAUSE HE HAD VOLUNTARILY RELINQUISHED A TITLE THAT WAS DISTASTEFUL TO HIM AND A STATION THAT WAS DISTASTEFUL TO HIM AND HAD LEFT HIS COUNTRY HE SUBMITTED BEFORE THE WORD EMIGRANT IN THE PRESENT ACCEPTATION BY THE TRIBUNAL WAS IN USE
403-128339-0018 TO LIVE BY HIS OWN INDUSTRY IN ENGLAND RATHER THAN ON THE INDUSTRY OF THE OVERLADEN PEOPLE OF FRANCE WHAT PROOF HAD HE OF THIS HE HANDED IN THE NAMES OF TWO WITNESSES THEOPHILE GABELLE AND ALEXANDRE MANETTE
403-128339-0019 THE PRESIDENT REMINDED HIM TRUE BUT NOT AN ENGLISH WOMAN A CITIZENESS OF FRANCE YES BY BIRTH HER NAME AND FAMILY
403-128339-0020 LUCIE MANETTE ONLY DAUGHTER OF DOCTOR MANETTE THE GOOD PHYSICIAN WHO SITS THERE THIS ANSWER HAD A HAPPY EFFECT UPON THE AUDIENCE CRIES IN EXALTATION OF THE WELL KNOWN GOOD PHYSICIAN RENT THE HALL
403-128339-0021 ON THESE FEW STEPS OF HIS DANGEROUS WAY CHARLES DARNAY HAD SET HIS FOOT ACCORDING TO DOCTOR MANETTE'S REITERATED INSTRUCTIONS THE SAME CAUTIOUS COUNSEL DIRECTED EVERY STEP THAT LAY BEFORE HIM
403-128339-0022 AND HAD PREPARED EVERY INCH OF HIS ROAD THE PRESIDENT ASKED WHY HAD HE RETURNED TO FRANCE WHEN HE DID AND NOT SOONER HE HAD NOT RETURNED SOONER HE REPLIED SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD NO MEANS OF LIVING IN FRANCE SAVE THOSE HE HAD RESIGNED
403-128339-0023 WHEREAS IN ENGLAND HE LIVED BY GIVING INSTRUCTION IN THE FRENCH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE HE HAD RETURNED WHEN HE DID ON THE PRESSING AND WRITTEN ENTREATY OF A FRENCH CITIZEN WHO REPRESENTED THAT HIS LIFE WAS ENDANGERED BY HIS ABSENCE
403-128339-0024 HE HAD COME BACK TO SAVE A CITIZEN'S LIFE AND TO BEAR HIS TESTIMONY AT WHATEVER PERSONAL HAZARD TO THE TRUTH WAS THAT CRIMINAL IN THE EYES OF THE REPUBLIC THE POPULACE CRIED ENTHUSIASTICALLY
403-128339-0025 NO AND THE PRESIDENT RANG HIS BELL TO QUIET THEM WHICH IT DID NOT FOR THEY CONTINUED TO CRY NO
403-128339-0026 THE PRESIDENT REQUIRED THE NAME OF THAT CITIZEN THE ACCUSED EXPLAINED THAT THE CITIZEN WAS HIS FIRST WITNESS HE ALSO REFERRED WITH CONFIDENCE TO THE CITIZEN'S LETTER WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM HIM AT THE BARRIER
403-128339-0027 BUT WHICH HE DID NOT DOUBT WOULD BE FOUND AMONG THE PAPERS THEN BEFORE THE PRESIDENT THE DOCTOR HAD TAKEN CARE THAT IT SHOULD BE THERE HAD ASSURED HIM THAT IT WOULD BE THERE
403-128339-0028 THAT IN THE PRESSURE OF BUSINESS IMPOSED ON THE TRIBUNAL BY THE MULTITUDE OF ENEMIES OF THE REPUBLIC WITH WHICH IT HAD TO DEAL HE HAD BEEN SLIGHTLY OVERLOOKED IN HIS PRISON OF THE ABBAYE IN FACT
403-128339-0029 BY THE SURRENDER OF THE CITIZEN EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY DOCTOR MANETTE WAS NEXT QUESTIONED HIS HIGH PERSONAL POPULARITY AND THE CLEARNESS OF HIS ANSWERS MADE A GREAT IMPRESSION
403-128339-0030 BUT AS HE PROCEEDED AS HE SHOWED THAT THE ACCUSED WAS HIS FIRST FRIEND ON HIS RELEASE FROM HIS LONG IMPRISONMENT THAT THE ACCUSED HAD REMAINED IN ENGLAND ALWAYS FAITHFUL AND DEVOTED TO HIS DAUGHTER AND HIMSELF IN THEIR EXILE THAT
403-128339-0031 SO FAR FROM BEING IN FAVOUR WITH THE ARISTOCRAT GOVERNMENT THERE HE HAD ACTUALLY BEEN TRIED FOR HIS LIFE BY IT AS THE FOE OF ENGLAND AND FRIEND OF THE UNITED STATES AS HE BROUGHT THESE CIRCUMSTANCES INTO VIEW WITH THE GREATEST DISCRETION
403-128339-0032 AND WITH THE STRAIGHTFORWARD FORCE OF TRUTH AND EARNESTNESS THE JURY AND THE POPULACE BECAME ONE AT LAST WHEN HE APPEALED BY NAME TO MONSIEUR LORRY AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN THEN AND THERE PRESENT WHO LIKE HIMSELF
403-128339-0033 HAD BEEN A WITNESS ON THAT ENGLISH TRIAL AND COULD CORROBORATE HIS ACCOUNT OF IT THE JURY DECLARED THAT THEY HAD HEARD ENOUGH AND THAT THEY WERE READY WITH THEIR VOTES IF THE PRESIDENT WERE CONTENT TO RECEIVE THEM AT EVERY VOTE
403-128339-0034 THE JURYMEN VOTED ALOUD AND INDIVIDUALLY THE POPULACE SET UP A SHOUT OF APPLAUSE ALL THE VOICES WERE IN THE PRISONER'S FAVOUR AND THE PRESIDENT DECLARED HIM FREE
403-128339-0035 THEN BEGAN ONE OF THOSE EXTRAORDINARY SCENES WITH WHICH THE POPULACE SOMETIMES GRATIFIED THEIR FICKLENESS OR THEIR BETTER IMPULSES TOWARDS GENEROSITY AND MERCY
403-128339-0036 OR WHICH THEY REGARDED AS SOME SET OFF AGAINST THEIR SWOLLEN ACCOUNT OF CRUEL RAGE NO MAN CAN DECIDE NOW TO WHICH OF THESE MOTIVES SUCH EXTRAORDINARY SCENES WERE REFERABLE IT IS PROBABLE TO A BLENDING OF ALL THE THREE
403-128339-0037 WITH THE SECOND PREDOMINATING NO SOONER WAS THE ACQUITTAL PRONOUNCED THAN TEARS WERE SHED AS FREELY AS BLOOD AT ANOTHER TIME AND SUCH FRATERNAL EMBRACES WERE BESTOWED UPON THE PRISONER BY AS MANY OF BOTH SEXES AS COULD RUSH AT HIM
403-128339-0038 THAT AFTER HIS LONG AND UNWHOLESOME CONFINEMENT HE WAS IN DANGER OF FAINTING FROM EXHAUSTION NONE THE LESS BECAUSE HE KNEW VERY WELL THAT THE VERY SAME PEOPLE CARRIED BY ANOTHER CURRENT WOULD HAVE RUSHED AT HIM WITH THE VERY SAME INTENSITY
403-128339-0039 TO REND HIM TO PIECES AND STREW HIM OVER THE STREETS HIS REMOVAL TO MAKE WAY FOR OTHER ACCUSED PERSONS WHO WERE TO BE TRIED RESCUED HIM FROM THESE CARESSES FOR THE MOMENT
403-128339-0040 FIVE WERE TO BE TRIED TOGETHER NEXT AS ENEMIES OF THE REPUBLIC FORASMUCH AS THEY HAD NOT ASSISTED IT BY WORD OR DEED SO QUICK WAS THE TRIBUNAL TO COMPENSATE ITSELF AND THE NATION FOR A CHANCE LOST
403-128339-0041 THAT THESE FIVE CAME DOWN TO HIM BEFORE HE LEFT THE PLACE CONDEMNED TO DIE WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE FIRST OF THEM TOLD HIM SO WITH THE CUSTOMARY PRISON SIGN OF DEATH A RAISED FINGER AND THEY ALL ADDED IN WORDS
403-128339-0042 LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC THE FIVE HAD HAD IT IS TRUE NO AUDIENCE TO LENGTHEN THEIR PROCEEDINGS FOR WHEN HE AND DOCTOR MANETTE EMERGED FROM THE GATE THERE WAS A GREAT CROWD ABOUT IT
403-128339-0043 IN WHICH THERE SEEMED TO BE EVERY FACE HE HAD SEEN IN COURT EXCEPT TWO FOR WHICH HE LOOKED IN VAIN ON HIS COMING OUT THE CONCOURSE MADE AT HIM ANEW WEEPING EMBRACING AND SHOUTING ALL BY TURNS AND ALL TOGETHER
403-128339-0044 UNTIL THE VERY TIDE OF THE RIVER ON THE BANK OF WHICH THE MAD SCENE WAS ACTED SEEMED TO RUN MAD LIKE THE PEOPLE ON THE SHORE THEY PUT HIM INTO A GREAT CHAIR THEY HAD AMONG THEM
403-128339-0045 IN WINDING AND TRAMPING THROUGH THEM AS THEY HAD REDDENED THEM BELOW THE SNOW WITH A DEEPER DYE THEY CARRIED HIM THUS INTO THE COURTYARD OF THE BUILDING WHERE HE LIVED HER FATHER HAD GONE ON BEFORE TO PREPARE HER
403-128339-0046 AND WHEN HER HUSBAND STOOD UPON HIS FEET SHE DROPPED INSENSIBLE IN HIS ARMS AS HE HELD HER TO HIS HEART AND TURNED HER BEAUTIFUL HEAD BETWEEN HIS FACE AND THE BRAWLING CROWD
403-128339-0047 SO THAT HIS TEARS AND HER LIPS MIGHT COME TOGETHER UNSEEN A FEW OF THE PEOPLE FELL TO DANCING
403-128339-0048 AFTER GRASPING THE DOCTOR'S HAND AS HE STOOD VICTORIOUS AND PROUD BEFORE HIM AFTER GRASPING THE HAND OF MISTER LORRY
403-128339-0049 AND AFTER EMBRACING THE EVER ZEALOUS AND FAITHFUL PROSS WHO LIFTED HER HE TOOK HIS WIFE IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED HER UP TO THEIR ROOMS LUCIE MY OWN I AM SAFE O DEAREST CHARLES
403-128339-0050 LET ME THANK GOD FOR THIS ON MY KNEES AS I HAVE PRAYED TO HIM THEY ALL REVERENTLY BOWED THEIR HEADS AND HEARTS WHEN SHE WAS AGAIN IN HIS ARMS HE SAID TO HER
403-128339-0051 NO OTHER MAN IN ALL THIS FRANCE COULD HAVE DONE WHAT HE HAS DONE FOR ME SHE LAID HER HEAD UPON HER FATHER'S BREAST AS SHE HAD LAID HIS POOR HEAD ON HER OWN BREAST LONG LONG AGO HE WAS HAPPY IN THE RETURN HE HAD MADE HER
403-128339-0052 HE WAS PROUD OF HIS STRENGTH
403-216-0000 A FEW DAYS PASSED AWAY AND CATHERINE THOUGH NOT ALLOWING HERSELF TO SUSPECT HER FRIEND COULD NOT HELP WATCHING HER CLOSELY THE RESULT OF HER OBSERVATIONS WAS NOT AGREEABLE
403-216-0001 IT MIGHT HAVE PASSED UNNOTICED A SOMETHING OF LANGUID INDIFFERENCE OR OF THAT BOASTED ABSENCE OF MIND WHICH CATHERINE HAD NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE WOULD OCCASIONALLY COME ACROSS HER BUT HAD NOTHING WORSE APPEARED
403-216-0002 THAT MIGHT ONLY HAVE SPREAD A NEW GRACE AND INSPIRED A WARMER INTEREST BUT WHEN CATHERINE SAW HER IN PUBLIC ADMITTING CAPTAIN TILNEY'S ATTENTIONS AS READILY AS THEY WERE OFFERED
403-216-0003 BUT IT WAS A DEGREE OF WILFUL THOUGHTLESSNESS WHICH CATHERINE COULD NOT BUT RESENT JAMES WAS THE SUFFERER SHE SAW HIM GRAVE AND UNEASY AND HOWEVER CARELESS OF HIS PRESENT COMFORT
403-216-0004 AND SHE THOUGHT WITH SINCERE COMPASSION OF HIS APPROACHING DISAPPOINTMENT FOR IN SPITE OF WHAT SHE HAD BELIEVED HERSELF TO OVERHEAR IN THE PUMP ROOM HIS BEHAVIOUR WAS SO INCOMPATIBLE WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF ISABELLA'S ENGAGEMENT
403-216-0005 SHE WISHED BY A GENTLE REMONSTRANCE TO REMIND ISABELLA OF HER SITUATION AND MAKE HER AWARE OF THIS DOUBLE UNKINDNESS BUT FOR REMONSTRANCE EITHER OPPORTUNITY OR COMPREHENSION WAS ALWAYS AGAINST HER
403-216-0006 IF ABLE TO SUGGEST A HINT ISABELLA COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND IT IN THIS DISTRESS THE INTENDED DEPARTURE OF THE TILNEY FAMILY BECAME HER CHIEF CONSOLATION THEIR JOURNEY INTO GLOUCESTERSHIRE WAS TO TAKE PLACE WITHIN A FEW DAYS
403-216-0007 AND CAPTAIN TILNEY'S REMOVAL WOULD AT LEAST RESTORE PEACE TO EVERY HEART BUT HIS OWN BUT CAPTAIN TILNEY HAD AT PRESENT NO INTENTION OF REMOVING HE WAS NOT TO BE OF THE PARTY TO NORTHANGER HE WAS TO CONTINUE AT BATH
403-216-0008 WHEN CATHERINE KNEW THIS HER RESOLUTION WAS DIRECTLY MADE SHE SPOKE TO HENRY TILNEY ON THE SUBJECT REGRETTING HIS BROTHER'S EVIDENT PARTIALITY FOR MISS THORPE AND ENTREATING HIM TO MAKE KNOWN HER PRIOR ENGAGEMENT
403-216-0009 MY BROTHER DOES KNOW IT WAS HENRY'S ANSWER DOES HE THEN WHY DOES HE STAY HERE HE MADE NO REPLY AND WAS BEGINNING TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE BUT SHE EAGERLY CONTINUED
403-216-0010 THE LONGER HE STAYS THE WORSE IT WILL BE FOR HIM AT LAST PRAY ADVISE HIM FOR HIS OWN SAKE AND FOR EVERYBODY'S SAKE TO LEAVE BATH DIRECTLY ABSENCE WILL IN TIME MAKE HIM COMFORTABLE AGAIN BUT HE CAN HAVE NO HOPE HERE
403-216-0011 HENRY SMILED AND SAID I AM SURE MY BROTHER WOULD NOT WISH TO DO THAT THEN YOU WILL PERSUADE HIM TO GO AWAY PERSUASION IS NOT AT COMMAND BUT PARDON ME
403-216-0012 I HAVE MYSELF TOLD HIM THAT MISS THORPE IS ENGAGED HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS ABOUT AND MUST BE HIS OWN MASTER NO HE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT HE IS ABOUT CRIED CATHERINE HE DOES NOT KNOW THE PAIN HE IS GIVING MY BROTHER
403-216-0013 NOT THAT JAMES HAS EVER TOLD ME SO BUT I AM SURE HE IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND ARE YOU SURE IT IS MY BROTHER'S DOING YES VERY SURE IS IT MY BROTHER'S ATTENTIONS TO MISS THORPE
403-216-0014 OR MISS THORPE'S ADMISSION OF THEM THAT GIVES THE PAIN
403-216-0015 I THINK MISTER MORLAND WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE A DIFFERENCE NO MAN IS OFFENDED BY ANOTHER MAN'S ADMIRATION OF THE WOMAN HE LOVES IT IS THE WOMAN ONLY WHO CAN MAKE IT A TORMENT CATHERINE BLUSHED FOR HER FRIEND AND SAID
403-216-0016 ISABELLA IS WRONG BUT I AM SURE SHE CANNOT MEAN TO TORMENT FOR SHE IS VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MY BROTHER SHE HAS BEEN IN LOVE WITH HIM EVER SINCE THEY FIRST MET AND WHILE MY FATHER'S CONSENT WAS UNCERTAIN SHE FRETTED HERSELF ALMOST INTO A FEVER
403-216-0017 YOU KNOW SHE MUST BE ATTACHED TO HIM I UNDERSTAND
403-216-0018 AFTER A SHORT PAUSE CATHERINE RESUMED WITH THEN YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ISABELLA SO VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MY BROTHER I CAN HAVE NO OPINION ON THAT SUBJECT BUT WHAT CAN YOUR BROTHER MEAN
403-216-0019 IF HE KNOWS HER ENGAGEMENT WHAT CAN HE MEAN BY HIS BEHAVIOUR YOU ARE A VERY CLOSE QUESTIONER AM I I ONLY ASK WHAT I WANT TO BE TOLD
403-216-0020 YES I THINK SO FOR YOU MUST KNOW YOUR BROTHER'S HEART MY BROTHER'S HEART AS YOU TERM IT ON THE PRESENT OCCASION I ASSURE YOU I CAN ONLY GUESS AT WELL
403-216-0021 WELL NAY IF IT IS TO BE GUESSWORK LET US ALL GUESS FOR OURSELVES TO BE GUIDED BY SECOND HAND CONJECTURE IS PITIFUL THE PREMISES ARE BEFORE YOU
403-216-0022 AFTER SOME MOMENTS CONSIDERATION YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GUESS AT YOUR BROTHER'S INTENTIONS FROM ALL THIS BUT I AM SURE I CANNOT BUT IS NOT YOUR FATHER UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT
403-216-0023 SURE IF YOUR FATHER WERE TO SPEAK TO HIM HE WOULD GO MY DEAR MISS MORLAND SAID HENRY IN THIS AMIABLE SOLICITUDE FOR YOUR BROTHER'S COMFORT MAY YOU NOT BE A LITTLE MISTAKEN
403-216-0024 ARE YOU NOT CARRIED A LITTLE TOO FAR WOULD HE THANK YOU EITHER ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT OR MISS THORPE'S FOR SUPPOSING THAT HER AFFECTION OR AT LEAST HER GOOD BEHAVIOUR IS ONLY TO BE SECURED BY HER SEEING NOTHING OF CAPTAIN TILNEY
403-216-0025 IS HE SAFE ONLY IN SOLITUDE OR IS HER HEART CONSTANT TO HIM ONLY WHEN UNSOLICITED BY ANYONE ELSE HE CANNOT THINK THIS AND YOU MAY BE SURE
403-216-0026 PERCEIVING HER STILL TO LOOK DOUBTFUL AND GRAVE HE ADDED THOUGH FREDERICK DOES NOT LEAVE BATH WITH US HE WILL PROBABLY REMAIN BUT A VERY SHORT TIME PERHAPS ONLY A FEW DAYS BEHIND US
403-216-0027 HIS LEAVE OF ABSENCE WILL SOON EXPIRE AND HE MUST RETURN TO HIS REGIMENT AND WHAT WILL THEN BE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
403-216-0028 THE MESS ROOM WILL DRINK ISABELLA THORPE FOR A FORTNIGHT AND SHE WILL LAUGH WITH YOUR BROTHER OVER POOR TILNEY'S PASSION FOR A MONTH CATHERINE WOULD CONTEND NO LONGER AGAINST COMFORT
405-130894-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN SHORTAGE OF AIR CONSEQUENTLY ABOVE BELOW AND AROUND THE NAUTILUS THERE WERE IMPENETRABLE FROZEN WALLS WE WERE THE ICE BANK'S PRISONERS THE CANADIAN BANGED A TABLE WITH HIS FEARSOME FIST
405-130894-0001 CONSEIL KEPT STILL I STARED AT THE CAPTAIN HIS FACE HAD RESUMED ITS USUAL EMOTIONLESSNESS HE CROSSED HIS ARMS HE PONDERED THE NAUTILUS DID NOT STIR THE CAPTAIN THEN BROKE INTO SPEECH GENTLEMEN
405-130894-0002 HE SAID IN A CALM VOICE THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF DYING UNDER THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH WE'RE PLACED THIS INEXPLICABLE INDIVIDUAL ACTED LIKE A MATHEMATICS PROFESSOR WORKING OUT A PROBLEM FOR HIS PUPILS THE FIRST WAY HE WENT ON
405-130894-0003 IS DEATH BY CRUSHING THE SECOND IS DEATH BY ASPHYXIATION I DON'T MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF DEATH BY STARVATION BECAUSE THE NAUTILUS'S PROVISIONS WILL CERTAINLY LAST LONGER THAN WE WILL
405-130894-0004 THEREFORE LET'S CONCENTRATE ON OUR CHANCES OF BEING CRUSHED OR ASPHYXIATED AS FOR ASPHYXIATION CAPTAIN I REPLIED THAT ISN'T A CAUSE FOR ALARM BECAUSE THE AIR TANKS ARE FULL TRUE
405-130894-0005 BUT THEY'LL SUPPLY AIR FOR ONLY TWO DAYS NOW THEN WE'VE BEEN BURIED BENEATH THE WATERS FOR THIRTY SIX HOURS AND THE NAUTILUS'S HEAVY ATMOSPHERE ALREADY NEEDS RENEWING IN ANOTHER FORTY EIGHT HOURS OUR RESERVE AIR WILL BE USED UP
405-130894-0006 WELL THEN CAPTAIN LET'S FREE OURSELVES WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS WE'LL TRY TO AT LEAST BY CUTTING THROUGH ONE OF THESE WALLS SURROUNDING US WHICH ONE I ASKED BORINGS WILL TELL US THAT
405-130894-0007 I'M GOING TO GROUND THE NAUTILUS ON THE LOWER SHELF THEN MY MEN WILL PUT ON THEIR DIVING SUITS AND ATTACK THE THINNEST OF THESE ICE WALLS CAN THE PANELS IN THE LOUNGE BE LEFT OPEN WITHOUT ILL EFFECT WE'RE NO LONGER IN MOTION
405-130894-0008 HISSING SOUNDS SOON TOLD ME THAT WATER WAS BEING ADMITTED INTO THE BALLAST TANKS THE NAUTILUS SLOWLY SETTLED AND RESTED ON THE ICY BOTTOM AT A DEPTH OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY METERS THE DEPTH AT WHICH THE LOWER SHELF OF ICE LAY SUBMERGED
405-130894-0009 MY FRIENDS I SAID WE'RE IN A SERIOUS PREDICAMENT BUT I'M COUNTING ON YOUR COURAGE AND ENERGY SIR THE CANADIAN REPLIED THIS IS NO TIME TO BORE YOU WITH MY COMPLAINTS
405-130894-0010 HE CAN USE ME ANY WAY HE WANTS HE WON'T TURN DOWN YOUR ASSISTANCE COME ALONG NED I LED THE CANADIAN TO THE ROOM WHERE THE NAUTILUS'S MEN WERE PUTTING ON THEIR DIVING SUITS I INFORMED THE CAPTAIN OF NED'S PROPOSITION
405-130894-0011 WHICH WAS PROMPTLY ACCEPTED THE CANADIAN GOT INTO HIS UNDERWATER COSTUME AND WAS READY AS SOON AS HIS FELLOW WORKERS
405-130894-0012 AFTER NED WAS DRESSED I REENTERED THE LOUNGE WHOSE WINDOWS HAD BEEN UNCOVERED STATIONED NEXT TO CONSEIL I EXAMINED THE STRATA SURROUNDING AND SUPPORTING THE NAUTILUS SOME MOMENTS LATER WE SAW A DOZEN CREWMEN SET FOOT ON THE SHELF OF ICE
405-130894-0013 BEFORE DIGGING INTO THE ICE THE CAPTAIN HAD TO OBTAIN BORINGS TO INSURE WORKING IN THE BEST DIRECTION LONG BORES WERE DRIVEN INTO THE SIDE WALLS BUT AFTER FIFTEEN METERS THE INSTRUMENTS WERE STILL IMPEDED BY THE THICKNESS OF THOSE WALLS
405-130894-0014 MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED METERS HIGH
405-130894-0015 THERE WE WERE SEPARATED FROM THE SEA BY A TEN METER BARRIER THAT'S HOW THICK THE ICEBERG WAS FROM THIS POINT ON IT WAS AN ISSUE OF CUTTING OUT A PIECE EQUAL IN SURFACE AREA TO THE NAUTILUS'S WATERLINE THIS MEANT DETACHING ABOUT
405-130894-0016 SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CUBIC METERS TO DIG A HOLE THROUGH WHICH THE SHIP COULD DESCEND BELOW THIS TRACT OF ICE WORK BEGAN IMMEDIATELY AND WAS CARRIED ON WITH TIRELESS TENACITY INSTEAD OF DIGGING ALL AROUND THE NAUTILUS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENTAILED EVEN GREATER DIFFICULTIES
405-130894-0017 THEN HIS MEN SIMULTANEOUSLY STAKED IT OFF AT SEVERAL POINTS AROUND ITS CIRCUMFERENCE SOON THEIR PICKS WERE VIGOROUSLY ATTACKING THIS COMPACT MATTER AND HUGE CHUNKS WERE LOOSENED FROM ITS MASS
405-130894-0018 THESE CHUNKS WEIGHED LESS THAN THE WATER AND BY AN UNUSUAL EFFECT OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY EACH CHUNK TOOK WING AS IT WERE TO THE ROOF OF THE TUNNEL
405-130894-0019 BUT THIS HARDLY MATTERED SO LONG AS THE LOWER SURFACE KEPT GROWING THINNER AFTER TWO HOURS OF ENERGETIC WORK NED LAND REENTERED EXHAUSTED HE AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE REPLACED BY NEW WORKMEN INCLUDING CONSEIL AND ME
405-130894-0020 THE NAUTILUS'S CHIEF OFFICER SUPERVISED US THE WATER STRUCK ME AS UNUSUALLY COLD BUT I WARMED UP PROMPTLY WHILE WIELDING MY PICK MY MOVEMENTS WERE QUITE FREE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE EXECUTED UNDER A PRESSURE OF THIRTY ATMOSPHERES
405-130894-0021 AND THE NAUTILUS'S ATMOSPHERE WHICH WAS ALREADY CHARGED WITH CARBON DIOXIDE THE AIR HADN'T BEEN RENEWED IN FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND ITS LIFE GIVING QUALITIES WERE CONSIDERABLY WEAKENED MEANWHILE
405-130894-0022 AFTER TWELVE HOURS HAD GONE BY WE HAD REMOVED FROM THE OUTLINED SURFACE AREA A SLICE OF ICE ONLY ONE METER THICK HENCE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED CUBIC METERS ASSUMING THE SAME WORK WOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED EVERY TWELVE HOURS
405-130894-0023 BEFORE THE NAUTILUS COULD RETURN TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES COULDN'T WE ALL DIE OF ASPHYXIATION WERE THIS SHIP AND EVERYONE ON BOARD DOOMED TO PERISH IN THIS TOMB OF ICE IT WAS A DREADFUL STATE OF AFFAIRS BUT WE FACED IT HEAD ON
405-130894-0024 EACH ONE OF US DETERMINED TO DO HIS DUTY TO THE END DURING THE NIGHT IN LINE WITH MY FORECASTS A NEW ONE METER SLICE WAS REMOVED FROM THIS IMMENSE SOCKET BUT IN THE MORNING WEARING MY DIVING SUIT
405-130894-0025 WHEN I NOTED THAT LITTLE BY LITTLE THE SIDE WALLS WERE CLOSING IN ON EACH OTHER THE LIQUID STRATA FARTHEST FROM THE TRENCH NOT WARMED BY THE MOVEMENTS OF WORKMEN AND TOOLS WERE SHOWING A TENDENCY TO SOLIDIFY IN THE FACE OF THIS IMMINENT NEW DANGER
405-130894-0026 THERE WAS NO POINT IN DAMPENING THE ENERGY THEY WERE PUTTING INTO OUR ARDUOUS RESCUE WORK BUT WHEN I RETURNED ON BOARD
405-130894-0027 I KNOW HE TOLD ME IN THAT CALM TONE THE MOST DREADFUL OUTLOOK COULDN'T CHANGE IT'S ONE MORE DANGER BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY WAY OF WARDING IT OFF OUR SOLE CHANCE FOR SALVATION
405-130894-0028 IS TO WORK FASTER THAN THE WATER SOLIDIFIES WE'VE GOT TO GET THERE FIRST THAT'S ALL GET THERE FIRST BY THEN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO THIS TYPE OF TALK FOR SEVERAL HOURS THAT DAY I WIELDED MY PICK DOGGEDLY
405-130894-0029 THE WORK KEPT ME GOING BESIDES WORKING MEANT LEAVING THE NAUTILUS WHICH MEANT BREATHING THE CLEAN OXYGEN DRAWN FROM THE AIR TANKS AND SUPPLIED BY OUR EQUIPMENT WHICH MEANT LEAVING THE THIN FOUL AIR BEHIND
405-130894-0030 NEAR EVENING ONE MORE METER HAD BEEN DUG FROM THE TRENCH WHEN I RETURNED ON BOARD I WAS WELLNIGH ASPHYXIATED BY THE CARBON DIOXIDE SATURATING THE AIR OH IF ONLY WE HAD THE CHEMICAL METHODS THAT WOULD ENABLE US TO DRIVE OUT THIS NOXIOUS GAS
405-130894-0031 THERE WAS NO LACK OF OXYGEN ALL THIS WATER CONTAINED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT
405-130894-0032 THIS LIFE GIVING ELASTIC FLUID COULD HAVE BEEN RESTORED TO US I HAD THOUGHT IT ALL OUT BUT TO NO AVAIL BECAUSE THE CARBON DIOXIDE PRODUCED BY OUR BREATHING PERMEATED EVERY PART OF THE SHIP TO ABSORB IT WE WOULD NEED TO FILL CONTAINERS WITH POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE
405-130894-0033 AND SHAKE THEM CONTINUALLY BUT THIS SUBSTANCE WAS MISSING ON BOARD AND NOTHING ELSE COULD REPLACE IT
405-130894-0034 WITHOUT THIS PRECAUTION WE WOULDN'T HAVE AWAKENED THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE NEXT DAY MARCH TWENTY SIXTH I RETURNED TO MY MINER'S TRADE WORKING TO REMOVE THE FIFTH METER THE ICE BANK'S SIDE WALLS AND UNDERBELLY HAD VISIBLY THICKENED
405-130894-0035 OBVIOUSLY THEY WOULD COME TOGETHER BEFORE THE NAUTILUS COULD BREAK FREE FOR AN INSTANT I WAS GRIPPED BY DESPAIR MY PICK NEARLY SLIPPED FROM MY HANDS WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS DIGGING IF I WAS TO DIE SMOTHERED AND CRUSHED BY THIS WATER TURNING TO STONE
405-130894-0036 A TORTURE UNDREAMED OF BY EVEN THE WILDEST SAVAGES I FELT LIKE I WAS LYING IN THE JAWS OF A FEARSOME MONSTER JAWS IRRESISTIBLY CLOSING SUPERVISING OUR WORK
405-130894-0037 WORKING HIMSELF CAPTAIN NEMO PASSED NEAR ME JUST THEN I TOUCHED HIM WITH MY HAND AND POINTED TO THE WALLS OF OUR PRISON THE STARBOARD WALL HAD MOVED FORWARD TO A POINT LESS THAN FOUR METERS FROM THE NAUTILUS'S HULL
405-130894-0038 THE CAPTAIN UNDERSTOOD AND GAVE ME A SIGNAL TO FOLLOW HIM WE RETURNED ON BOARD MY DIVING SUIT REMOVED I WENT WITH HIM TO THE LOUNGE PROFESSOR ARONNAX HE TOLD ME THIS CALLS FOR HEROIC MEASURES
405-130894-0039 OR WE'LL BE SEALED UP IN THIS SOLIDIFIED WATER AS IF IT WERE CEMENT YES I SAID BUT WHAT CAN WE DO OH HE EXCLAIMED
405-130894-0040 IF ONLY MY NAUTILUS WERE STRONG ENOUGH TO STAND THAT MUCH PRESSURE WITHOUT BEING CRUSHED WELL I ASKED NOT CATCHING THE CAPTAIN'S MEANING DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND HE WENT ON THAT THE CONGEALING OF THIS WATER
405-130894-0041 COULD COME TO OUR RESCUE DON'T YOU SEE THAT BY SOLIDIFYING IT COULD BURST THESE TRACTS OF ICE IMPRISONING US JUST AS ITS FREEZING CAN BURST THE HARDEST STONES AREN'T YOU AWARE THAT THIS FORCE COULD BE THE INSTRUMENT OF OUR SALVATION RATHER THAN OUR DESTRUCTION
405-130894-0042 I KNOW IT SIR SO WE CAN'T RELY ON NATURE TO RESCUE US ONLY OUR OWN EFFORTS WE MUST COUNTERACT THIS SOLIDIFICATION WE MUST HOLD IT IN CHECK NOT ONLY ARE THE SIDE WALLS CLOSING IN
405-130894-0043 BUT THERE AREN'T TEN FEET OF WATER AHEAD OR ASTERN OF THE NAUTILUS ALL AROUND US THIS FREEZE IS GAINING FAST HOW LONG I ASKED WILL THE OXYGEN IN THE AIR TANKS ENABLE US TO BREATHE ON BOARD THE CAPTAIN LOOKED ME STRAIGHT IN THE EYE
405-130894-0044 IT WAS NOW THE TWENTY SIXTH WE HAD LIVED OFF THE SHIP'S STORES FOR FIVE DAYS AND ALL REMAINING BREATHABLE AIR HAD TO BE SAVED FOR THE WORKMEN EVEN TODAY AS I WRITE THESE LINES MY SENSATIONS ARE SO INTENSE
405-130894-0045 THAT AN INVOLUNTARY TERROR SWEEPS OVER ME AND MY LUNGS STILL SEEM SHORT OF AIR MEANWHILE
405-130894-0046 BOILING WATER I EXCLAIMED YES SIR WE'RE SHUT UP IN A RELATIVELY CONFINED AREA IF THE NAUTILUS'S PUMPS CONTINUALLY INJECTED STREAMS OF BOILING WATER INTO THIS SPACE WOULDN'T THAT RAISE ITS TEMPERATURE AND DELAY ITS FREEZING
405-130894-0047 IT'S WORTH TRYING I SAID RESOLUTELY SO LET'S TRY IT PROFESSOR
405-130894-0048 CAPTAIN NEMO LED ME TO THE GALLEY WHERE A HUGE DISTILLING MECHANISM WAS AT WORK SUPPLYING DRINKING WATER VIA EVAPORATION THE MECHANISM WAS LOADED WITH WATER AND THE FULL ELECTRIC HEAT OF OUR BATTERIES WAS THROWN INTO COILS AWASH IN LIQUID
405-130894-0049 IN A FEW MINUTES THE WATER REACHED ONE HUNDRED DEGREES CENTIGRADE IT WAS SENT TO THE PUMPS WHILE NEW WATER REPLACED IT IN THE PROCESS THE HEAT GENERATED BY OUR BATTERIES WAS SO INTENSE THAT AFTER SIMPLY GOING THROUGH THE MECHANISM WATER DRAWN COLD FROM THE SEA ARRIVED
405-130894-0050 BOILING HOT AT THE BODY OF THE PUMP THE STEAMING WATER WAS INJECTED INTO THE ICY WATER OUTSIDE AND AFTER THREE HOURS HAD PASSED
405-130894-0051 THAT WAS ONE DEGREE GAINED
405-130894-0052 AFTER I MONITORED THE OPERATION'S PROGRESS DOUBLE CHECKING IT WITH MANY INSPECTIONS I TOLD THE CAPTAIN IT'S WORKING I THINK SO HE ANSWERED ME WE'VE ESCAPED BEING CRUSHED NOW WE HAVE ONLY ASPHYXIATION TO FEAR
405-130894-0053 THE INJECTIONS COULDN'T GET IT TO GO A SINGLE DEGREE HIGHER
405-130894-0054 I WAS FINALLY ASSURED THAT THERE WAS NO DANGER OF IT SOLIDIFYING BY THE NEXT DAY MARCH TWENTY SEVENTH SIX METERS OF ICE HAD BEEN TORN FROM THE SOCKET ONLY FOUR METERS WERE LEFT TO BE REMOVED THAT STILL MEANT FORTY EIGHT HOURS OF WORK
405-130894-0055 THE AIR COULDN'T BE RENEWED IN THE NAUTILUS'S INTERIOR ACCORDINGLY THAT DAY IT KEPT GETTING WORSE AN UNBEARABLE HEAVINESS WEIGHED ME DOWN NEAR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON THIS AGONIZING SENSATION AFFECTED ME TO AN INTENSE DEGREE
405-130894-0056 YAWNS DISLOCATED MY JAWS MY LUNGS WERE GASPING IN THEIR QUEST FOR THAT ENKINDLING ELASTIC FLUID REQUIRED FOR BREATHING NOW GROWING SCARCER AND SCARCER MY MIND WAS IN A DAZE I LAY OUTSTRETCHED STRENGTH GONE
405-130894-0057 NEARLY UNCONSCIOUS MY GALLANT CONSEIL FELT THE SAME SYMPTOMS SUFFERED THE SAME SUFFERINGS YET NEVER LEFT MY SIDE HE HELD MY HAND HE KEPT ENCOURAGING ME AND I EVEN HEARD HIM MUTTER
405-130894-0058 TO LEAVE MORE AIR FOR MASTER IT BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES TO HEAR HIM SAY THESE WORDS SINCE CONDITIONS INSIDE WERE UNIVERSALLY UNBEARABLE
405-130894-0059 PICKS RANG OUT ON THAT BED OF ICE ARMS GREW WEARY HANDS WERE RUBBED RAW BUT WHO CARED ABOUT EXHAUSTION WHAT DIFFERENCE WERE WOUNDS LIFE SUSTAINING AIR REACHED OUR LUNGS WE COULD BREATHE WE COULD BREATHE
405-130894-0060 AND YET NOBODY PROLONGED HIS UNDERWATER WORK BEYOND THE TIME ALLOTTED HIM HIS SHIFT OVER EACH MAN SURRENDERED TO A GASPING COMPANION THE AIR TANK THAT WOULD REVIVE HIM
405-130894-0061 WHEN HIS TIME WAS UP HE YIELDED HIS EQUIPMENT TO ANOTHER AND REENTERED THE FOUL AIR ON BOARD ALWAYS CALM UNFLINCHING AND UNCOMPLAINING THAT DAY THE USUAL WORK WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH EVEN GREATER ENERGY
405-130894-0062 OVER THE WHOLE SURFACE AREA ONLY TWO METERS WERE LEFT TO BE REMOVED ONLY TWO METERS SEPARATED US FROM THE OPEN SEA BUT THE SHIP'S AIR TANKS WERE NEARLY EMPTY THE LITTLE AIR THAT REMAINED HAD TO BE SAVED FOR THE WORKMEN NOT AN
405-130894-0063 ATOM FOR THE NAUTILUS WHEN I RETURNED ON BOARD I FELT HALF SUFFOCATED WHAT A NIGHT I'M UNABLE TO DEPICT IT SUCH SUFFERINGS ARE INDESCRIBABLE THE NEXT DAY I WAS SHORT WINDED
405-130894-0064 HEADACHES AND STAGGERING FITS OF DIZZINESS MADE ME REEL LIKE A DRUNK MY COMPANIONS WERE EXPERIENCING THE SAME SYMPTOMS SOME CREWMEN WERE AT THEIR LAST GASP
405-130894-0065 AND HE DECIDED TO CRUSH THIS LAYER THE MAN HAD KEPT HIS ENERGY AND COMPOSURE HE HAD SUBDUED PHYSICAL PAIN WITH MORAL STRENGTH HE COULD STILL THINK PLAN AND ACT AT HIS ORDERS THE CRAFT WAS EASED OFF
405-130894-0066 IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS RAISED FROM ITS ICY BED BY A CHANGE IN ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY WHEN IT WAS AFLOAT THE CREW TOWED IT LEADING IT RIGHT ABOVE THE IMMENSE TRENCH OUTLINED TO MATCH THE SHIP'S WATERLINE NEXT THE BALLAST TANKS FILLED WITH WATER
405-130894-0067 THE BOAT SANK AND WAS FITTED INTO ITS SOCKET JUST THEN THE WHOLE CREW RETURNED ON BOARD AND THE DOUBLE OUTSIDE DOOR WAS CLOSED BY THIS POINT THE NAUTILUS WAS RESTING ON A BED OF ICE ONLY ONE METER THICK
405-130894-0068 WE LISTENED WE FORGOT OUR SUFFERINGS WE HOPED ONCE MORE WE HAD STAKED OUR SALVATION ON THIS ONE LAST GAMBLE DESPITE THE BUZZING IN MY HEAD I SOON COULD HEAR VIBRATIONS UNDER THE NAUTILUS'S HULL WE TILTED
405-130894-0069 THE ICE CRACKED WITH AN ODD RIPPING SOUND LIKE PAPER TEARING AND THE NAUTILUS BEGAN SETTLING DOWNWARD WE'RE GOING THROUGH CONSEIL MUTTERED IN MY EAR I COULDN'T ANSWER HIM I CLUTCHED HIS HAND
405-130894-0070 I SQUEEZED IT IN AN INVOLUNTARY CONVULSION ALL AT ONCE CARRIED AWAY BY ITS FRIGHTFUL EXCESS LOAD THE NAUTILUS SANK INTO THE WATERS LIKE A CANNONBALL IN OTHER WORDS DROPPING AS IF IN A VACUUM
405-130894-0071 OUR FULL ELECTRIC POWER WAS THEN PUT ON THE PUMPS WHICH INSTANTLY BEGAN TO EXPEL WATER FROM THE BALLAST TANKS AFTER A FEW MINUTES WE HAD CHECKED OUR FALL THE PRESSURE GAUGE SOON INDICATED AN ASCENDING MOVEMENT
405-130894-0072 BROUGHT TO FULL SPEED THE PROPELLER MADE THE SHEET IRON HULL TREMBLE DOWN TO ITS RIVETS AND WE SPED NORTHWARD BUT HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO NAVIGATE UNDER THE ICE BANK TO THE OPEN SEA ANOTHER DAY I WOULD BE DEAD FIRST
405-130894-0073 MY MUSCLES HAD NO POWER TO CONTRACT I'M UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE HOURS THAT PASSED IN THIS WAY BUT I WAS AWARE THAT MY DEATH THROES HAD BEGUN I REALIZED THAT I WAS ABOUT TO DIE SUDDENLY I REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS
405-130894-0074 A FEW WHIFFS OF AIR HAD ENTERED MY LUNGS HAD WE RISEN TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES HAD WE CLEARED THE ICE BANK NO NED AND CONSEIL MY TWO GALLANT FRIENDS WERE SACRIFICING THEMSELVES TO SAVE ME
405-130894-0075 INSTEAD OF BREATHING IT THEMSELVES THEY HAD SAVED IT FOR ME AND WHILE THEY WERE SUFFOCATING THEY POURED LIFE INTO ME DROP BY DROP I TRIED TO PUSH THE DEVICE AWAY THEY HELD MY HANDS AND FOR A FEW MOMENTS I COULD BREATHE LUXURIOUSLY
405-130894-0076 MY EYES FLEW TOWARD THE CLOCK IT WAS ELEVEN IN THE MORNING IT HAD TO BE MARCH TWENTY EIGHTH THE NAUTILUS WAS TRAVELING AT THE FRIGHTFUL SPEED OF FORTY MILES PER HOUR IT WAS WRITHING IN THE WATERS
405-130894-0077 HAD HE PERISHED HAD HIS COMPANIONS DIED WITH HIM
405-130894-0078 SEPARATING US FROM THE OPEN AIR WAS A MERE TRACT OF ICE COULD WE BREAK THROUGH IT
405-130895-0000 FROM CAPE HORN TO THE AMAZON HOW I GOT ONTO THE PLATFORM I'M UNABLE TO SAY PERHAPS THE CANADIAN TRANSFERRED ME THERE BUT I COULD BREATHE I COULD INHALE THE LIFE GIVING SEA AIR
405-130895-0001 NEXT TO ME MY TWO COMPANIONS WERE GETTING TIPSY ON THE FRESH OXYGEN PARTICLES POOR SOULS WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM LONG STARVATION MUSTN'T POUNCE HEEDLESSLY ON THE FIRST FOOD GIVEN THEM WE ON THE OTHER HAND DIDN'T HAVE TO PRACTICE SUCH MODERATION
405-130895-0002 WE COULD SUCK THE ATOMS FROM THE AIR BY THE LUNGFUL AND IT WAS THE BREEZE THE BREEZE ITSELF THAT POURED INTO US THIS LUXURIOUS INTOXICATION AHHH CONSEIL WAS PUTTING IN
405-130895-0003 WHAT FINE OXYGEN LET MASTER HAVE NO FEARS ABOUT BREATHING THERE'S ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE AS FOR NED LAND HE DIDN'T SAY A WORD BUT HIS WIDE OPEN JAWS WOULD HAVE SCARED OFF A SHARK
405-130895-0004 AND WHAT POWERFUL INHALATIONS THE CANADIAN DREW LIKE A FURNACE GOING FULL BLAST OUR STRENGTH RETURNED PROMPTLY AND WHEN I LOOKED AROUND I SAW THAT WE WERE ALONE ON THE PLATFORM NO CREWMEN
405-130895-0005 THOSE STRANGE SEAMEN ON THE NAUTILUS WERE CONTENT WITH THE OXYGEN CIRCULATING INSIDE NOT ONE OF THEM HAD COME UP TO ENJOY THE OPEN AIR THE FIRST WORDS I PRONOUNCED WERE WORDS OF APPRECIATION
405-130895-0006 AND GRATITUDE TO MY TWO COMPANIONS NED AND CONSEIL HAD KEPT ME ALIVE DURING THE FINAL HOURS OF OUR LONG DEATH THROES BUT NO EXPRESSION OF THANKS COULD REPAY THEM FULLY FOR SUCH DEVOTION
405-130895-0007 GOOD LORD PROFESSOR NED LAND ANSWERED ME DON'T MENTION IT WHAT DID WE DO THAT'S SO PRAISEWORTHY NOT A THING IT WAS A QUESTION OF SIMPLE ARITHMETIC YOUR LIFE IS WORTH MORE THAN OURS SO WE HAD TO SAVE IT
405-130895-0008 AND YOU MY GALLANT CONSEIL YOU SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL NOT TOO MUCH TO BE CANDID WITH MASTER I WAS LACKING A FEW THROATFULS OF AIR BUT I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN BY
405-130895-0009 IT TOOK MY BREATH AWAY IN A MANNER OF CONFOUNDED BY THIS LAPSE INTO BANALITY CONSEIL LEFT HIS SENTENCE HANGING MY FRIENDS I REPLIED VERY MOVED
405-130895-0010 WE'RE BOUND TO EACH OTHER FOREVER AND I'M DEEPLY INDEBTED TO YOU WHICH I'LL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CANADIAN SHOT BACK
405-130895-0011 CONSEIL PUT IN YES NED LAND WENT ON YOU CAN REPAY YOUR DEBT BY COMING WITH ME WHEN I LEAVE THIS INFERNAL NAUTILUS BY THE WAY CONSEIL SAID ARE WE GOING IN A FAVORABLE DIRECTION
405-130895-0012 YES I REPLIED BECAUSE WE'RE GOING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN AND HERE THE SUN IS DUE NORTH SURE NED LAND WENT ON BUT IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER WE'LL MAKE FOR THE ATLANTIC OR THE PACIFIC
405-130895-0013 BUT IF WE RETURNED TO THE PACIFIC FAR FROM EVERY POPULATED SHORE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO NED LAND'S PLANS WE WOULD SOON SETTLE THIS IMPORTANT POINT THE NAUTILUS TRAVELED SWIFTLY
405-130895-0014 SOON WE HAD CLEARED THE ANTARCTIC CIRCLE PLUS THE PROMONTORY OF CAPE HORN
405-130895-0015 BY THEN ALL OUR PAST SUFFERINGS WERE FORGOTTEN THE MEMORY OF THAT IMPRISONMENT UNDER THE ICE FADED FROM OUR MINDS WE HAD THOUGHTS ONLY OF THE FUTURE
405-130895-0016 NOW THEN THAT EVENING IT BECAME OBVIOUS MUCH TO MY SATISFACTION THAT WE WERE RETURNING NORTH BY THE ATLANTIC ROUTE I SHARED THE RESULTS OF MY OBSERVATIONS WITH THE CANADIAN AND CONSEIL
405-130895-0017 THAT'S GOOD NEWS THE CANADIAN REPLIED BUT WHERE'S THE NAUTILUS GOING I'M UNABLE TO SAY NED AFTER THE SOUTH POLE
405-130895-0018 WE'LL NEVER REGRET HAVING KNOWN HIM ESPECIALLY ONCE WE'VE LEFT HIM NED LAND SHOT BACK THE NEXT DAY
405-130895-0019 WHEN THE NAUTILUS ROSE TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES A FEW MINUTES BEFORE NOON WE RAISED LAND TO THE WEST
405-130895-0020 THE LAND OF FIRE A NAME GIVEN IT BY EARLY NAVIGATORS AFTER THEY SAW NUMEROUS CURLS OF SMOKE RISING FROM THE NATIVES HUTS THIS LAND OF FIRE FORMS A HUGE CLUSTER OF ISLANDS OVER THIRTY LEAGUES LONG AND EIGHTY LEAGUES WIDE
405-130895-0021 ITS COASTLINE LOOKED FLAT BUT HIGH MOUNTAINS ROSE IN THE DISTANCE I EVEN THOUGHT I GLIMPSED MT SARMIENTO
405-130895-0022 A PYRAMID SHAPED BLOCK OF SHALE WITH A VERY SHARP SUMMIT WHICH DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT'S CLEAR OR VEILED IN VAPOR PREDICTS FAIR WEATHER OR FOUL AS NED LAND TOLD ME A FIRST CLASS BAROMETER MY FRIEND
405-130895-0023 YES SIR A NATURAL BAROMETER THAT DIDN'T LET ME DOWN WHEN I NAVIGATED THE NARROWS OF THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN JUST THEN ITS PEAK APPEARED BEFORE US STANDING OUT DISTINCTLY AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE SKIES THIS FORECAST FAIR WEATHER
405-130895-0024 BULB BEARING SEAWEED OF WHICH THE OPEN SEA AT THE POLE HAD REVEALED A FEW SPECIMENS WITH THEIR SMOOTH VISCOUS FILAMENTS THEY MEASURED AS MUCH AS THREE HUNDRED METERS LONG GENUINE CABLES MORE THAN AN INCH THICK AND VERY TOUGH
405-130895-0025 IT SERVED AS BOTH NEST AND NOURISHMENT FOR MYRIADS OF CRUSTACEANS AND MOLLUSKS FOR CRABS AND CUTTLEFISH HERE SEALS AND OTTERS COULD INDULGE IN A SUMPTUOUS MEAL MIXING MEAT FROM FISH
405-130895-0026 WITH VEGETABLES FROM THE SEA LIKE THE ENGLISH WITH THEIR IRISH STEWS THE NAUTILUS PASSED OVER THESE LUSH LUXURIANT DEPTHS WITH TREMENDOUS SPEED
405-130895-0027 IN THESE WATERWAYS OUR NETS BROUGHT UP FINE SAMPLES OF ALGAE IN PARTICULAR CERTAIN FUCUS PLANTS WHOSE ROOTS WERE LADEN WITH THE WORLD'S BEST MUSSELS
405-130895-0028 AS FOR FISH I SPECIFICALLY OBSERVED SOME BONY FISH BELONGING TO THE GOBY GENUS ESPECIALLY SOME GUDGEON TWO DECIMETERS LONG SPRINKLED WITH WHITISH AND YELLOW SPOTS
405-130895-0029 I LIKEWISE MARVELED AT THE NUMEROUS MEDUSAS INCLUDING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF THEIR BREED THE COMPASS JELLYFISH UNIQUE TO THE FALKLAND SEAS
405-130895-0030 SOME OF THESE JELLYFISH WERE SHAPED LIKE VERY SMOOTH SEMISPHERIC PARASOLS WITH RUSSET STRIPES AND FRINGES OF TWELVE NEAT FESTOONS OTHERS LOOKED LIKE
405-130895-0031 UPSIDE DOWN BASKETS FROM WHICH WIDE LEAVES AND LONG RED TWIGS WERE GRACEFULLY TRAILING THEY SWAM WITH QUIVERINGS OF THEIR FOUR LEAFLIKE ARMS LETTING THE OPULENT TRESSES OF THEIR TENTACLES DANGLE IN THE DRIFT
405-130895-0032 SHADOWS ILLUSIONS MELTING AND EVAPORATING OUTSIDE THEIR NATIVE ELEMENT WHEN THE LAST TIPS OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS HAD DISAPPEARED BELOW THE HORIZON
405-130895-0033 BETWEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY FIVE METERS AND WENT ALONG THE SOUTH AMERICAN COAST
405-130895-0034 DIDN'T PUT IN AN APPEARANCE
405-130895-0035 KEEPING TO ITS NORTHERLY HEADING IT FOLLOWED THE LONG WINDINGS OF SOUTH AMERICA BY THEN WE HAD FARED SIXTEEN THOUSAND LEAGUES SINCE COMING ON BOARD IN THE SEAS OF JAPAN
405-130895-0036 NEAR ELEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WE CUT THE TROPIC OF CAPRICORN ON THE THIRTY SEVENTH MERIDIAN PASSING WELL OUT FROM CAPE FRIO MUCH TO NED LAND'S DISPLEASURE
405-130895-0037 CAPTAIN NEMO HAD NO LIKING FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF BRAZIL'S POPULOUS SHORES BECAUSE HE SHOT BY WITH DIZZYING SPEED
4051-10927-0000 IT'S LATE ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SHE SAID WHEN SHE HAD GONE THROUGH THE DOORWAY ANNA IT'S NECESSARY FOR ME TO HAVE A TALK WITH YOU WITH ME SHE SAID WONDERINGLY SHE CAME OUT FROM BEHIND THE DOOR OF THE DRESSING ROOM AND LOOKED AT HIM
4051-10927-0001 WHY WHAT IS IT WHAT ABOUT SHE ASKED SITTING DOWN WELL LET'S TALK IF IT'S SO NECESSARY BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO GET TO SLEEP ANNA SAID WHAT CAME TO HER LIPS AND MARVELED HEARING HERSELF AT HER OWN CAPACITY FOR LYING
4051-10927-0002 HOW SIMPLE AND NATURAL WERE HER WORDS AND HOW LIKELY THAT SHE WAS SIMPLY SLEEPY
4051-10927-0003 THAT ANYONE WHO DID NOT KNOW HER AS HER HUSBAND KNEW HER COULD NOT HAVE NOTICED ANYTHING UNNATURAL EITHER IN THE SOUND OR THE SENSE OF HER WORDS BUT TO HIM KNOWING HER KNOWING THAT WHENEVER HE WENT TO BED FIVE MINUTES LATER THAN USUAL
4051-10927-0004 SHE NOTICED IT AND ASKED HIM THE REASON TO HIM KNOWING THAT EVERY JOY EVERY PLEASURE AND PAIN THAT SHE FELT SHE COMMUNICATED TO HIM AT ONCE TO HIM NOW TO SEE THAT SHE DID NOT CARE TO NOTICE HIS STATE OF MIND
4051-10927-0005 THAT SHE DID NOT CARE TO SAY A WORD ABOUT HERSELF MEANT A GREAT DEAL HE SAW THAT THE INMOST RECESSES OF HER SOUL THAT HAD ALWAYS HITHERTO LAIN OPEN BEFORE HIM WERE CLOSED AGAINST HIM MORE THAN THAT HE SAW FROM HER TONE
4051-10927-0006 THAT SHE WAS NOT EVEN PERTURBED AT THAT BUT AS IT WERE SAID STRAIGHT OUT TO HIM YES IT'S SHUT UP AND SO IT MUST BE AND WILL BE IN FUTURE NOW HE EXPERIENCED A FEELING SUCH AS A MAN MIGHT HAVE RETURNING HOME AND FINDING HIS OWN HOUSE LOCKED UP
4051-10927-0007 BUT PERHAPS THE KEY MAY YET BE FOUND THOUGHT ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH I WANT TO WARN YOU HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE THAT THROUGH THOUGHTLESSNESS AND LACK OF CAUTION
4051-10927-0008 YOUR TOO ANIMATED CONVERSATION THIS EVENING WITH COUNT VRONSKY HE ENUNCIATED THE NAME FIRMLY AND WITH DELIBERATE EMPHASIS ATTRACTED ATTENTION HE TALKED AND LOOKED AT HER LAUGHING EYES WHICH FRIGHTENED HIM NOW WITH THEIR IMPENETRABLE LOOK
4051-10927-0009 I WASN'T DULL DOES THAT OFFEND YOU ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SHIVERED AND BENT HIS HANDS TO MAKE THE JOINTS CRACK
4051-10927-0010 ANNA IS THIS YOU SAID ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH QUIETLY MAKING AN EFFORT OVER HIMSELF AND RESTRAINING THE MOTION OF HIS FINGERS
4051-10927-0011 WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH PAUSED AND RUBBED HIS FOREHEAD AND HIS EYES HE SAW THAT INSTEAD OF DOING AS HE HAD INTENDED THAT IS TO SAY WARNING HIS WIFE AGAINST A MISTAKE IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD
4051-10927-0012 HE HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY BECOME AGITATED OVER WHAT WAS THE AFFAIR OF HER CONSCIENCE AND WAS STRUGGLING AGAINST THE BARRIER HE FANCIED BETWEEN THEM
4051-10927-0013 AND I BEG YOU TO LISTEN TO IT I CONSIDER JEALOUSY AS YOU KNOW A HUMILIATING AND DEGRADING FEELING AND I SHALL NEVER ALLOW MYSELF TO BE INFLUENCED BY IT BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN RULES OF DECORUM WHICH CANNOT BE DISREGARDED WITH IMPUNITY THIS EVENING IT WAS NOT I OBSERVED IT
4051-10927-0014 BUT JUDGING BY THE IMPRESSION MADE ON THE COMPANY EVERYONE OBSERVED THAT YOUR CONDUCT AND DEPORTMENT WERE NOT ALTOGETHER WHAT COULD BE DESIRED I POSITIVELY DON'T UNDERSTAND SAID ANNA SHRUGGING HER SHOULDERS HE DOESN'T CARE SHE THOUGHT
4051-10927-0015 BUT OTHER PEOPLE NOTICED IT AND THAT'S WHAT UPSETS HIM YOU'RE NOT WELL ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SHE ADDED AND SHE GOT UP AND WOULD HAVE GONE TOWARDS THE DOOR BUT HE MOVED FORWARD AS THOUGH HE WOULD STOP HER HIS FACE WAS UGLY AND FORBIDDING
4051-10927-0016 AS ANNA HAD NEVER SEEN HIM SHE STOPPED AND BENDING HER HEAD BACK AND ON ONE SIDE BEGAN WITH HER RAPID HAND TAKING OUT HER HAIRPINS WELL I'M LISTENING TO WHAT'S TO COME SHE SAID CALMLY AND IRONICALLY AND INDEED I LISTEN WITH INTEREST
4051-10927-0017 BEGAN ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH FERRETING IN ONE'S SOUL ONE OFTEN FERRETS OUT SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HAVE LAIN THERE UNNOTICED YOUR FEELINGS ARE AN AFFAIR OF YOUR OWN CONSCIENCE
4051-10927-0018 TO MYSELF AND TO GOD TO POINT OUT TO YOU YOUR DUTIES OUR LIFE HAS BEEN JOINED NOT BY MAN BUT BY GOD THAT UNION CAN ONLY BE SEVERED BY A CRIME AND A CRIME OF THAT NATURE BRINGS ITS OWN CHASTISEMENT
4051-10927-0019 I DON'T UNDERSTAND A WORD AND OH DEAR HOW SLEEPY I AM UNLUCKILY SHE SAID RAPIDLY PASSING HER HAND THROUGH HER HAIR FEELING FOR THE REMAINING HAIRPINS ANNA FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T SPEAK LIKE THAT HE SAID GENTLY PERHAPS I AM MISTAKEN
4051-10927-0020 BUT BELIEVE ME WHAT I SAY I SAY AS MUCH FOR MYSELF AS FOR YOU I AM YOUR HUSBAND AND I LOVE YOU FOR AN INSTANT HER FACE FELL AND THE MOCKING GLEAM IN HER EYES DIED AWAY BUT THE WORD LOVE THREW HER INTO REVOLT AGAIN SHE THOUGHT
4051-10927-0021 LOVE CAN HE LOVE IF HE HADN'T HEARD THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS LOVE HE WOULD NEVER HAVE USED THE WORD HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT LOVE IS ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH REALLY I DON'T UNDERSTAND SHE SAID DEFINE WHAT IT IS YOU FIND
4051-10927-0022 THAT MY WORDS SEEM TO YOU UTTERLY UNNECESSARY AND OUT OF PLACE
4051-10927-0023 IN THAT CASE I BEG YOU TO FORGIVE ME BUT IF YOU ARE CONSCIOUS YOURSELF OF EVEN THE SMALLEST FOUNDATION FOR THEM
4051-10927-0024 WHEN SHE CAME INTO THE BEDROOM HE WAS ALREADY IN BED HIS LIPS WERE STERNLY COMPRESSED AND HIS EYES LOOKED AWAY FROM HER ANNA GOT INTO HER BED AND LAY EXPECTING EVERY MINUTE THAT HE WOULD BEGIN TO SPEAK TO HER AGAIN SHE BOTH FEARED HIS SPEAKING AND WISHED FOR IT
4051-10927-0025 BUT HE WAS SILENT SHE WAITED FOR A LONG WHILE WITHOUT MOVING AND HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT HIM SHE THOUGHT OF THAT OTHER SHE PICTURED HIM AND FELT HOW HER HEART WAS FLOODED WITH EMOTION AND GUILTY DELIGHT AT THE THOUGHT OF HIM SUDDENLY
4051-10927-0026 SHE HEARD AN EVEN TRANQUIL SNORE FOR THE FIRST INSTANT ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SEEMED AS IT WERE APPALLED AT HIS OWN SNORING AND CEASED BUT AFTER AN INTERVAL OF TWO BREATHINGS THE SNORE SOUNDED AGAIN
4051-10927-0027 WITH A NEW TRANQUIL RHYTHM IT'S LATE IT'S LATE SHE WHISPERED WITH A SMILE
4051-11217-0000 WHY IF YOU WILL BELIEVE ME THEY WERE THE SONS OF THAT VERY PHRIXUS WHO IN HIS CHILDHOOD HAD BEEN CARRIED TO COLCHIS ON THE BACK OF THE GOLDEN FLEECED RAM SINCE THAT TIME PHRIXUS HAD MARRIED THE KING'S DAUGHTER
4051-11217-0001 AND HAD SPENT THEIR PLAY DAYS IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE GROVE IN THE CENTER OF WHICH THE GOLDEN FLEECE WAS HANGING UPON A TREE THEY WERE NOW ON THEIR WAY TO GREECE IN HOPES OF GETTING BACK A KINGDOM THAT HAD BEEN WRONGFULLY TAKEN FROM THEIR FATHER
4051-11217-0002 WHEN THE PRINCES UNDERSTOOD WHITHER THE ARGONAUTS WERE GOING THEY OFFERED TO TURN BACK AND GUIDE THEM TO COLCHIS
4051-11217-0003 EVERY PERSON WHO MIGHT VENTURE WITHIN HIS REACH THERE ARE OTHER DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY CONTINUED THE YOUNG PRINCES
4051-11217-0004 I DO NOT WONDER THAT YOU THINK THE DRAGON VERY TERRIBLE YOU HAVE GROWN UP FROM INFANCY IN THE FEAR OF THIS MONSTER
4051-11217-0005 AT ALL EVENTS TURN BACK WHO MAY I WILL NEVER SEE GREECE AGAIN UNLESS I CARRY WITH ME THE GOLDEN FLEECE WE WILL NONE OF US TURN BACK CRIED HIS NINE AND FORTY BRAVE COMRADES
4051-11217-0006 MUCH GOOD MAY IT DO HIM AND ORPHEUS WHOSE CUSTOM IT WAS TO SET EVERYTHING TO MUSIC BEGAN TO HARP AND SING MOST GLORIOUSLY
4051-11217-0007 AND NOTHING SO TRULY HONORABLE AS TO BE EATEN UP AT ONE MOUTHFUL IN CASE OF THE WORST AFTER THIS BEING NOW UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THE TWO PRINCES WHO WERE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE WAY
4051-11217-0008 HEARD OF THEIR ARRIVAL HE INSTANTLY SUMMONED JASON TO COURT
4051-11217-0009 WHO DETHRONED HIS FATHER YOU ARE WELCOME BRAVE JASON
4051-11217-0010 PRAY ARE YOU ON A PLEASURE VOYAGE
4051-11217-0011 OR WHAT OTHER CAUSE HAS PROCURED ME THE HAPPINESS OF SEEING YOU AT MY COURT GREAT SIR REPLIED JASON
4051-11217-0012 FOR CHIRON HAD TAUGHT HIM HOW TO BEHAVE WITH PROPRIETY WHETHER TO KINGS OR BEGGARS
4051-11217-0013 PROVIDED I BRING HIM THE GOLDEN FLEECE THIS AS YOUR MAJESTY IS AWARE IS NOW HANGING ON A TREE HERE AT COLCHIS AND I HUMBLY SOLICIT YOUR GRACIOUS LEAVE TO TAKE IT AWAY IN SPITE OF HIMSELF THE KING'S FACE TWISTED ITSELF INTO AN ANGRY FROWN
4051-11217-0014 FOR ABOVE ALL THINGS ELSE IN THE WORLD HE PRIZED THE GOLDEN FLEECE AND WAS EVEN SUSPECTED OF HAVING DONE A VERY WICKED ACT IN ORDER TO GET IT INTO HIS OWN POSSESSION
4051-11217-0015 HAD COME TO COLCHIS WITH THE SOLE PURPOSE OF TAKING AWAY HIS CHIEF TREASURE
4051-11217-0016 WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS WHICH YOU MUST FULFILL BEFORE GETTING POSSESSION OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE I HAVE HEARD REJOINED THE YOUTH THAT A DRAGON LIES BENEATH THE TREE ON WHICH THE PRIZE HANGS AND THAT WHOEVER APPROACHES HIM RUNS THE RISK OF BEING DEVOURED AT A MOUTHFUL
4051-11217-0017 TRUE SAID THE KING WITH A SMILE THAT DID NOT LOOK PARTICULARLY GOOD NATURED VERY TRUE YOUNG MAN BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS AS HARD OR PERHAPS A LITTLE HARDER TO BE DONE BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING DEVOURED BY THE DRAGON FOR EXAMPLE
4051-11217-0018 WHICH VULCAN THE WONDERFUL BLACKSMITH MADE FOR ME THERE IS A FURNACE IN EACH OF THEIR STOMACHS AND THEY BREATHE SUCH HOT FIRE OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS AND NOSTRILS THAT NOBODY HAS HITHERTO GONE NIGH THEM WITHOUT BEING INSTANTLY BURNED TO A SMALL BLACK CINDER
4051-11217-0019 I MUST ENCOUNTER THE PERIL ANSWERED JASON COMPOSEDLY SINCE IT STANDS IN THE WAY OF MY PURPOSE
4051-11217-0020 FROM WHICH CADMUS RAISED A CROP OF ARMED MEN THEY ARE AN UNRULY SET OF REPROBATES THOSE SONS OF THE DRAGON'S TEETH AND UNLESS YOU TREAT THEM SUITABLY THEY WILL FALL UPON YOU SWORD IN HAND
4051-11217-0021 AND THE FOUR FOOTED PEDANT HIS SCHOOLMASTER INTO THE BARGAIN WHY WHAT A FOOLHARDY SELF CONCEITED COXCOMB HE IS WE'LL SEE WHAT MY FIRE BREATHING BULLS WILL DO FOR HIM WELL PRINCE JASON HE CONTINUED ALOUD AND AS COMPLAISANTLY AS HE COULD
4051-11217-0022 MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE FOR TO DAY AND TO MORROW MORNING SINCE YOU INSIST UPON IT YOU SHALL TRY YOUR SKILL AT THE PLOW WHILE THE KING TALKED WITH JASON A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN WAS STANDING BEHIND THE THRONE SHE FIXED HER EYES EARNESTLY UPON THE YOUTHFUL STRANGER
4051-11217-0023 THIS YOUNG WOMAN FOLLOWED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM I AM THE KING'S DAUGHTER SHE SAID TO HIM AND MY NAME IS MEDEA I KNOW A GREAT DEAL OF WHICH OTHER YOUNG PRINCESSES ARE IGNORANT AND CAN DO MANY THINGS WHICH THEY WOULD BE AFRAID SO MUCH AS TO DREAM OF IF YOU WILL TRUST TO ME
4051-11217-0024 I CAN INSTRUCT YOU HOW TO TAME THE FIERY BULLS AND SOW THE DRAGON'S TEETH AND GET THE GOLDEN FLEECE INDEED BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS ANSWERED JASON IF YOU WILL DO ME THIS SERVICE I PROMISE TO BE GRATEFUL TO YOU MY WHOLE LIFE LONG GAZING AT MEDEA
4051-11217-0025 HE BEHELD A WONDERFUL INTELLIGENCE IN HER FACE SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE PERSONS WHOSE EYES ARE FULL OF MYSTERY SO THAT WHILE LOOKING INTO THEM
4051-11217-0026 YET CAN NEVER BE CERTAIN WHETHER YOU SEE INTO THE FARTHEST DEPTHS OR WHETHER THERE BE NOT SOMETHING ELSE HIDDEN AT THE BOTTOM IF JASON HAD BEEN CAPABLE OF FEARING ANYTHING
4051-11217-0027 FOR BEAUTIFUL AS SHE NOW LOOKED
4051-11217-0028 PRINCESS HE EXCLAIMED YOU SEEM INDEED VERY WISE AND VERY POWERFUL BUT HOW CAN YOU HELP ME TO DO THE THINGS OF WHICH YOU SPEAK ARE YOU AN ENCHANTRESS YES PRINCE JASON ANSWERED MEDEA WITH A SMILE
4051-11217-0029 IT IS WELL FOR YOU THAT I AM FAVORABLY INCLINED FOR OTHERWISE YOU WOULD HARDLY ESCAPE BEING SNAPPED UP BY THE DRAGON I SHOULD NOT SO MUCH CARE FOR THE DRAGON REPLIED JASON IF I ONLY KNEW HOW TO MANAGE THE BRAZEN FOOTED AND FIERY LUNGED BULLS
4051-11217-0030 WHICH WILL PREVENT YOU FROM BEING BURNED UP AND CURE YOU IF YOU CHANCE TO BE A LITTLE SCORCHED
4051-11217-0031 WHICH IT CONTAINED AND WHERE TO MEET HER AT MIDNIGHT ONLY BE BRAVE ADDED SHE AND BEFORE DAYBREAK THE BRAZEN BULLS SHALL BE TAMED THE YOUNG MAN ASSURED HER THAT HIS HEART WOULD NOT FAIL HIM HE THEN REJOINED HIS COMRADES AND TOLD THEM WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THE PRINCESS AND HIMSELF
4051-11217-0032 AND WARNED THEM TO BE IN READINESS IN CASE THERE MIGHT BE NEED OF THEIR HELP AT THE APPOINTED HOUR HE MET THE BEAUTIFUL MEDEA ON THE MARBLE STEPS OF THE KING'S PALACE
4051-11217-0033 JUST AS THEY HAD BEEN PULLED OUT OF THE MONSTER'S JAWS BY CADMUS LONG AGO MEDEA THEN LED JASON DOWN THE PALACE STEPS AND THROUGH THE SILENT STREETS OF THE CITY AND INTO THE ROYAL PASTURE GROUND WHERE THE TWO BRAZEN FOOTED BULLS WERE KEPT IT WAS A STARRY NIGHT
4051-11217-0034 WITH A BRIGHT GLEAM ALONG THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE SKY
4051-11217-0035 IN THAT FARTHEST CORNER OF THE FIELD IT WILL BE EXCELLENT SPORT I ASSURE YOU WHEN THEY CATCH A GLIMPSE OF YOUR FIGURE MY FATHER AND ALL HIS COURT DELIGHT IN NOTHING SO MUCH AS TO SEE A STRANGER TRYING TO YOKE THEM IN ORDER TO COME AT THE GOLDEN FLEECE
4051-11217-0036 IT MAKES A HOLIDAY IN COLCHIS WHENEVER SUCH A THING HAPPENS FOR MY PART I ENJOY IT IMMENSELY YOU CANNOT IMAGINE IN WHAT A MERE TWINKLING OF AN EYE THEIR HOT BREATH SHRIVELS A YOUNG MAN INTO A BLACK CINDER ARE YOU SURE BEAUTIFUL MEDEA ASKED JASON
4051-11217-0037 THE INSTANT HE MADE A STEP FARTHER
4051-11217-0038 THESE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WERE CAUSED BY THE BREATH OF THE BRAZEN BULLS WHICH WAS QUIETLY STEALING OUT OF THEIR FOUR NOSTRILS AS THEY LAY CHEWING THEIR CUDS AT THE FIRST TWO OR THREE STEPS WHICH JASON MADE
4051-11217-0039 THE FOUR FIERY STREAMS APPEARED TO GUSH OUT SOMEWHAT MORE PLENTIFULLY FOR THE TWO BRAZEN BULLS HAD HEARD HIS FOOT TRAMP AND WERE LIFTING UP THEIR HOT NOSES TO SNUFF THE AIR HE WENT A LITTLE FARTHER
4051-11217-0040 ONE OTHER STRIDE DID BOLD JASON MAKE AND SUDDENLY AS A STREAK OF LIGHTNING ON CAME THESE FIERY ANIMALS
4051-11217-0041 AS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE FASHION WITH ANGRY BULLS THEIR BREATH SCORCHED THE HERBAGE BEFORE THEM SO INTENSELY HOT IT WAS INDEED THAT IT CAUGHT A DRY TREE UNDER WHICH JASON WAS NOW STANDING AND SET IT ALL IN A LIGHT BLAZE BUT AS FOR JASON HIMSELF
4051-11218-0000 GREATLY ENCOURAGED AT FINDING HIMSELF NOT YET TURNED INTO A CINDER
4051-11218-0001 JUST AS THE BRAZEN BRUTES FANCIED THEMSELVES SURE OF TOSSING HIM INTO THE AIR HE CAUGHT ONE OF THEM BY THE HORN AND THE OTHER BY HIS SCREWED UP TAIL AND HELD THEM IN A GRIPE LIKE THAT OF AN IRON VICE ONE WITH HIS RIGHT HAND THE OTHER WITH HIS LEFT
4051-11218-0002 TO BE SURE BUT THE SECRET OF THE MATTER WAS THAT THE BRAZEN BULLS WERE ENCHANTED CREATURES AND THAT JASON HAD BROKEN THE SPELL OF THEIR FIERY FIERCENESS BY HIS BOLD WAY OF HANDLING THEM AND EVER SINCE THAT TIME
4051-11218-0003 WHEN DANGER ASSAILS THEM TO DO WHAT THEY CALL TAKING THE BULL BY THE HORNS AND TO GRIPE HIM BY THE TAIL IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING THAT IS TO THROW ASIDE FEAR AND OVERCOME THE PERIL BY DESPISING IT
4051-11218-0004 IT WAS NOW EASY TO YOKE THE BULLS AND TO HARNESS THEM TO THE PLOW
4051-11218-0005 WHO PERHAPS USED TO ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE HARNESSED TO THE PLOW AT ANY RATE OUR HERO SUCCEEDED PERFECTLY WELL IN BREAKING UP THE GREENSWARD AND BY THE TIME THAT THE MOON WAS A QUARTER OF HER JOURNEY UP THE SKY THE PLOWED FIELD LAY BEFORE HIM
4051-11218-0006 A LARGE TRACT OF BLACK EARTH READY TO BE SOWN WITH THE DRAGON'S TEETH SO JASON SCATTERED THEM BROADCAST AND HARROWED THEM INTO THE SOIL WITH A BRUSH HARROW AND TOOK HIS STAND ON THE EDGE OF THE FIELD ANXIOUS TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT
4051-11218-0007 MUST WE WAIT LONG FOR HARVEST TIME HE INQUIRED OF MEDEA WHO WAS NOW STANDING BY HIS SIDE WHETHER SOONER OR LATER IT WILL BE SURE TO COME ANSWERED THE PRINCESS A CROP OF ARMED MEN NEVER FAILS TO SPRING UP WHEN THE DRAGON'S TEETH HAVE BEEN SOWN
4051-11218-0008 AND WHOLE MONTHS BEFORE THE YELLOW GRAIN WOULD BE RIPENED FOR THE SICKLE BUT BY AND BY ALL OVER THE FIELD
4051-11218-0009 LIKE SPARKLING DROPS OF DEW THESE BRIGHT OBJECTS SPROUTED HIGHER AND PROVED TO BE THE STEEL HEADS OF SPEARS THEN THERE WAS A DAZZLING GLEAM FROM A VAST NUMBER OF POLISHED BRASS HELMETS BENEATH WHICH AS THEY GREW FARTHER OUT OF THE SOIL
4051-11218-0010 TORE THEMSELVES UP BY THE ROOTS WHEREVER A DRAGON'S TOOTH HAD FALLEN THERE STOOD A MAN ARMED FOR BATTLE THEY MADE A CLANGOR WITH THEIR SWORDS AGAINST THEIR SHIELDS AND EYED ONE ANOTHER FIERCELY
4051-11218-0011 FULL OF RAGE AND STORMY PASSIONS AND READY TO TAKE THE LIFE OF EVERY HUMAN BROTHER IN RECOMPENSE OF THE BOON OF THEIR OWN EXISTENCE
4051-11218-0012 AND HOW IT WOULD HAVE REJOICED ANY GREAT CAPTAIN WHO WAS BENT ON CONQUERING THE WORLD LIKE ALEXANDER OR NAPOLEON TO RAISE A CROP OF ARMED SOLDIERS AS EASILY AS JASON DID
4051-11218-0013 CLASHING THEIR SWORDS AGAINST THEIR SHIELDS AND BOILING OVER WITH THE RED HOT THIRST FOR BATTLE THEN THEY BEGAN TO SHOUT SHOW US THE ENEMY LEAD US TO THE CHARGE DEATH OR VICTORY COME ON BRAVE COMRADES CONQUER OR DIE
4051-11218-0014 AND A HUNDRED OTHER OUTCRIES SUCH AS MEN ALWAYS BELLOW FORTH ON A BATTLE FIELD AND WHICH THESE DRAGON PEOPLE SEEMED TO HAVE AT THEIR TONGUES ENDS AT LAST THE FRONT RANK CAUGHT SIGHT OF JASON WHO BEHOLDING THE FLASH OF SO MANY WEAPONS IN THE MOONLIGHT
4051-11218-0015 HAD THOUGHT IT BEST TO DRAW HIS SWORD IN A MOMENT ALL THE SONS OF THE DRAGON'S TEETH APPEARED TO TAKE JASON FOR AN ENEMY AND CRYING WITH ONE VOICE GUARD THE GOLDEN FLEECE THEY RAN AT HIM WITH UPLIFTED SWORDS AND PROTRUDED SPEARS
4051-11218-0016 THE ARMED MEN WERE NOW SO NIGH THAT JASON COULD DISCERN THE FIRE FLASHING OUT OF THEIR ENRAGED EYES WHEN HE LET FLY THE STONE AND SAW IT STRIKE THE HELMET OF A TALL WARRIOR WHO WAS RUSHING UPON HIM WITH HIS BLADE ALOFT
4051-11218-0017 AND INSTEAD OF RUNNING ANY FARTHER TOWARDS JASON THEY BEGAN TO FIGHT AMONG THEMSELVES THE CONFUSION SPREAD THROUGH THE HOST
4051-11218-0018 HEWING AND STABBING AT ONE ANOTHER LOPPING OFF ARMS HEADS AND LEGS AND DOING SUCH MEMORABLE DEEDS THAT JASON WAS FILLED WITH IMMENSE ADMIRATION ALTHOUGH AT THE SAME TIME HE COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING TO BEHOLD THESE MIGHTY MEN PUNISHING EACH OTHER
4051-11218-0019 FOR AN OFFENSE WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD COMMITTED IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT SPACE OF TIME ALMOST AS SHORT INDEED AS IT HAD TAKEN THEM TO GROW UP ALL BUT ONE OF THE HEROES OF THE DRAGON'S TEETH WERE STRETCHED LIFELESS ON THE FIELD
4051-11218-0020 THE LAST SURVIVOR THE BRAVEST AND STRONGEST OF THE WHOLE HAD JUST FORCE ENOUGH TO WAVE HIS CRIMSON SWORD OVER HIS HEAD AND GIVE A SHOUT OF EXULTATION CRYING VICTORY VICTORY IMMORTAL FAME
4051-11218-0021 WHEN HE HIMSELF FELL DOWN AND LAY QUIETLY AMONG HIS SLAIN BRETHREN AND THERE WAS THE END OF THE ARMY THAT HAD SPROUTED FROM THE DRAGON'S TEETH THAT FIERCE AND FEVERISH FIGHT WAS THE ONLY ENJOYMENT WHICH THEY HAD TASTED ON THIS BEAUTIFUL EARTH
4051-11218-0022 LET THEM SLEEP IN THE BED OF HONOR SAID THE PRINCESS MEDEA WITH A SLY SMILE AT JASON THE WORLD WILL ALWAYS HAVE SIMPLETONS ENOUGH JUST LIKE THEM FIGHTING AND DYING FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT AND FANCYING THAT POSTERITY
4051-11218-0023 WILL TAKE THE TROUBLE TO PUT LAUREL WREATHS ON THEIR RUSTY AND BATTERED HELMETS COULD YOU HELP SMILING PRINCE JASON TO SEE THE SELF CONCEIT OF THAT LAST FELLOW
4051-11218-0024 YOU WILL THINK DIFFERENTLY IN THE MORNING SAID MEDEA TRUE THE GOLDEN FLEECE MAY NOT BE SO VALUABLE AS YOU HAVE THOUGHT IT BUT THEN THERE IS NOTHING BETTER IN THE WORLD AND ONE MUST NEEDS HAVE AN OBJECT YOU KNOW COME YOUR NIGHT'S WORK HAS BEEN WELL PERFORMED
4051-11218-0025 THAT THE FIRST PART OF YOUR ALLOTTED TASK IS FULFILLED
4051-11218-0026 ENTERING THE PRESENCE CHAMBER HE STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE AND MADE A LOW OBEISANCE YOUR EYES LOOK HEAVY PRINCE JASON OBSERVED THE KING YOU APPEAR TO HAVE SPENT A SLEEPLESS NIGHT
4051-11218-0027 AND HAVE CONCLUDED NOT TO GET YOURSELF SCORCHED TO A CINDER IN ATTEMPTING TO TAME MY BRAZEN LUNGED BULLS
4051-11218-0028 THE FIELD HAS BEEN PLOWED THE DRAGON'S TEETH HAVE BEEN SOWN BROADCAST AND HARROWED INTO THE SOIL
4051-11218-0029 AND DEPART WITH MY NINE AND FORTY COMRADES
4051-11218-0030 AND LOOKED VERY ANGRY AND EXCESSIVELY DISTURBED FOR HE KNEW THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS KINGLY PROMISE HE OUGHT NOW TO PERMIT JASON TO WIN THE FLEECE IF HIS COURAGE AND SKILL SHOULD ENABLE HIM TO DO SO BUT SINCE THE YOUNG MAN HAD MET WITH SUCH GOOD LUCK IN THE MATTER OF THE BRAZEN BULLS
4051-11218-0031 AND THE DRAGON'S TEETH THE KING FEARED THAT HE WOULD BE EQUALLY SUCCESSFUL IN SLAYING THE DRAGON AND THEREFORE THOUGH HE WOULD GLADLY HAVE SEEN JASON SNAPPED UP AT A MOUTHFUL HE WAS RESOLVED AND IT WAS A VERY WRONG THING OF THIS WICKED POTENTATE
4051-11218-0032 NOT TO RUN ANY FURTHER RISK OF LOSING HIS BELOVED FLEECE YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED IN THIS BUSINESS YOUNG MAN SAID HE IF MY UNDUTIFUL DAUGHTER MEDEA HAD NOT HELPED YOU WITH HER ENCHANTMENTS HAD YOU ACTED FAIRLY YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THIS INSTANT
4051-11218-0033 TO SPEAK MY MIND PLAINLY YOU SHALL NEVER SET EYES ON SO MUCH AS ONE OF ITS GLISTENING LOCKS JASON LEFT THE KING'S PRESENCE IN GREAT SORROW AND ANGER HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING BETTER
4051-11218-0034 MARCH AT ONCE TO THE GROVE OF MARS SLAY THE DRAGON TAKE POSSESSION OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE GET ON BOARD THE ARGO AND SPREAD ALL SAIL FOR IOLCHOS THE SUCCESS OF THIS SCHEME DEPENDED IT IS TRUE ON THE DOUBTFUL POINT
4051-11218-0035 AT SO MANY MOUTHFULS BY THE DRAGON BUT AS JASON WAS HASTENING DOWN THE PALACE STEPS
4051-11218-0036 AND ALTHOUGH SHE HAD DONE HIM SO MUCH SERVICE ONLY THE NIGHT BEFORE HE WAS BY NO MEANS VERY CERTAIN THAT SHE WOULD NOT DO HIM AN EQUALLY GREAT MISCHIEF BEFORE SUNSET THESE ENCHANTRESSES YOU MUST KNOW ARE NEVER TO BE DEPENDED UPON
4051-11218-0037 WILL HE GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE WITHOUT ANY FURTHER RISK OR TROUBLE ON THE CONTRARY ANSWERED JASON HE IS VERY ANGRY WITH ME FOR TAMING THE BRAZEN BULLS AND SOWING THE DRAGON'S TEETH
4051-11218-0038 AND HE FORBIDS ME TO MAKE ANY MORE ATTEMPTS AND POSITIVELY REFUSES TO GIVE UP THE GOLDEN FLEECE WHETHER I SLAY THE DRAGON OR NO YES JASON SAID THE PRINCESS AND I CAN TELL YOU MORE UNLESS YOU SET SAIL FROM COLCHIS
4051-11218-0039 STEALING THROUGH THE STREETS OF COLCHIS ON THEIR WAY TO THE SACRED GROVE
4051-11218-0040 LOWING NODDING THEIR HEADS AND THRUSTING FORTH THEIR SNOUTS WHICH AS OTHER CATTLE DO
4051-11218-0041 THEIR FIERCE NATURE WAS THOROUGHLY TAMED AND WITH THEIR FIERCENESS THE TWO FURNACES IN THEIR STOMACHS HAD LIKEWISE BEEN EXTINGUISHED
4051-11218-0042 THAN EVER BEFORE INDEED IT HAD HERETOFORE BEEN A GREAT INCONVENIENCE TO THESE POOR ANIMALS THAT WHENEVER THEY WISHED TO EAT A MOUTHFUL OF GRASS THE FIRE OUT OF THEIR NOSTRILS HAD SHRIVELED IT UP BEFORE THEY COULD MANAGE TO CROP IT
4051-11218-0043 HOW THEY CONTRIVED TO KEEP THEMSELVES ALIVE IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE BUT NOW INSTEAD OF EMITTING JETS OF FLAME AND STREAMS OF SULPHUROUS VAPOR THEY BREATHED THE VERY SWEETEST OF COW BREATH AFTER KINDLY PATTING THE BULLS
4051-11218-0044 JASON FOLLOWED MEDEA'S GUIDANCE INTO THE GROVE OF MARS WHERE THE GREAT OAK TREES THAT HAD BEEN GROWING FOR CENTURIES THREW SO THICK A SHADE THAT THE MOONBEAMS STRUGGLED VAINLY TO FIND THEIR WAY THROUGH IT
4051-11218-0045 MEDEA SQUEEZED JASON'S HAND LOOK YONDER SHE WHISPERED DO YOU SEE IT GLEAMING AMONG THE VENERABLE OAKS THERE WAS A RADIANCE NOT LIKE THE MOONBEAMS BUT RATHER RESEMBLING THE GOLDEN GLORY OF THE SETTING SUN
4051-11218-0046 WHAT IS IT ASKED JASON HAVE YOU COME SO FAR TO SEEK IT
4051-11218-0047 WHEN IT GLITTERS BEFORE YOUR EYES IT IS THE GOLDEN FLEECE JASON WENT ONWARD A FEW STEPS FARTHER AND THEN STOPPED TO GAZE O HOW BEAUTIFUL IT LOOKED SHINING WITH A MARVELOUS LIGHT OF ITS OWN THAT
4051-11218-0048 PRIZE WHICH SO MANY HEROES HAD LONGED TO BEHOLD BUT HAD PERISHED IN THE QUEST OF IT EITHER BY THE PERILS OF THEIR VOYAGE OR BY THE FIERY BREATH OF THE BRAZEN LUNGED BULLS HOW GLORIOUSLY IT SHINES CRIED JASON IN A RAPTURE IT
4051-11218-0049 THE TERRIBLE DRAGON HAD QUITE SLIPPED OUT OF JASON'S MEMORY SOON HOWEVER SOMETHING CAME TO PASS THAT REMINDED HIM WHAT PERILS WERE STILL TO BE ENCOUNTERED AN ANTELOPE THAT PROBABLY MISTOOK THE YELLOW RADIANCE FOR SUNRISE CAME
4051-11218-0050 FOR HE WAS TWISTED ROUND THE TRUNK OF THE TREE ON WHICH THE FLEECE HUNG AND SEIZING THE POOR ANTELOPE SWALLOWED HIM WITH ONE SNAP OF HIS JAWS AFTER THIS FEAT THE DRAGON SEEMED SENSIBLE THAT SOME OTHER LIVING CREATURE WAS WITHIN REACH
4051-11218-0051 ON WHICH HE FELT INCLINED TO FINISH HIS MEAL IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS HE KEPT POKING HIS UGLY SNOUT AMONG THE TREES STRETCHING OUT HIS NECK A TERRIBLE LONG WAY NOW HERE
4051-11218-0052 UPON MY WORD AS THE HEAD CAME WAVING AND UNDULATING THROUGH THE AIR AND REACHING ALMOST WITHIN ARM'S LENGTH OF PRINCE JASON IT WAS A VERY HIDEOUS AND UNCOMFORTABLE SIGHT
4051-11218-0053 THE GAPE OF HIS ENORMOUS JAWS WAS NEARLY AS WIDE AS THE GATEWAY OF THE KING'S PALACE WELL JASON WHISPERED MEDEA FOR SHE WAS ILL NATURED AS ALL ENCHANTRESSES ARE AND WANTED TO MAKE THE BOLD YOUTH TREMBLE
4051-11218-0054 WHAT DO YOU THINK NOW OF YOUR PROSPECT OF WINNING THE GOLDEN FLEECE JASON ANSWERED ONLY BY DRAWING HIS SWORD AND MAKING A STEP FORWARD STAY FOOLISH YOUTH SAID MEDEA GRASPING HIS ARM
4051-11218-0055 FAR MORE EFFECTUALLY THAN YOUR SWORD THE DRAGON HAD PROBABLY HEARD THE VOICES FOR SWIFT AS LIGHTNING HIS BLACK HEAD AND FORKED TONGUE CAME HISSING AMONG THE TREES AGAIN DARTING FULL FORTY FEET AT A STRETCH AS IT APPROACHED
4051-11218-0056 MEDEA TOSSED THE CONTENTS OF THE GOLD BOX RIGHT DOWN THE MONSTER'S WIDE OPEN THROAT IMMEDIATELY WITH AN OUTRAGEOUS HISS AND A TREMENDOUS WRIGGLE FLINGING HIS TAIL UP TO THE TIP TOP OF THE TALLEST TREE
4051-11218-0057 AND SHATTERING ALL ITS BRANCHES AS IT CRASHED HEAVILY DOWN AGAIN THE DRAGON FELL AT FULL LENGTH UPON THE GROUND AND LAY QUITE MOTIONLESS IT IS ONLY A SLEEPING POTION SAID THE ENCHANTRESS TO PRINCE JASON
4051-11218-0058 SO I DID NOT WISH TO KILL HIM OUTRIGHT QUICK SNATCH THE PRIZE AND LET US BEGONE YOU HAVE WON THE GOLDEN FLEECE JASON CAUGHT THE FLEECE FROM THE TREE
4051-11218-0059 WITH HER PEACOCK BESIDE HER SHE CLAPPED HER HANDS FOR JOY AND BECKONING HIM TO MAKE HASTE DISAPPEARED AMONG THE DUSKINESS OF THE TREES
4051-11218-0060 WHO WERE DISPORTING THEMSELVES IN THE MOONLIGHT A FEW HUNDRED FEET ALOFT JASON BADE THEM TELL THE REST OF THE ARGONAUTS TO EMBARK AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE BUT LYNCEUS WITH HIS SHARP EYES HAD ALREADY CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HIM BRINGING THE GOLDEN FLEECE
4051-11218-0061 ALTHOUGH SEVERAL STONE WALLS A HILL AND THE BLACK SHADOWS OF THE GROVE OF MARS INTERVENED BETWEEN BY HIS ADVICE THE HEROES HAD SEATED THEMSELVES ON THE BENCHES OF THE GALLEY
4051-11218-0062 HELD PERPENDICULARLY READY TO LET FALL INTO THE WATER AS JASON DREW NEAR HE HEARD THE TALKING IMAGE CALLING TO HIM WITH MORE THAN ORDINARY EAGERNESS IN ITS GRAVE SWEET VOICE MAKE HASTE PRINCE JASON FOR YOUR LIFE MAKE HASTE
4088-158077-0000 THE WAR MESSAGE CONCLUDED WITH STILL ANOTHER DEFENSE OF THE FIGHT FOR POLITICAL LIBERTY TO SUCH A TASK WE CAN DEDICATE OUR LIVES AND OUR FORTUNES EVERYTHING THAT WE ARE AND EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE WITH THE PRIDE OF THOSE WHO KNOW
4088-158077-0001 WE WERE FACE TO FACE WITH THE QUESTION WHICH WE HAD CONSIDERED AT THE CONVENTION THE PREVIOUS MONTH WHEN WAR WAS RUMORED AS TO WHAT POSITION WE AS AN ORGANIZATION SHOULD TAKE IN THIS SITUATION THE ATMOSPHERE OF THAT CONVENTION HAD BEEN DRAMATIC IN THE EXTREME
4088-158077-0002 MOST OF THE DELEGATES ASSEMBLED HAD BEEN APPROACHED EITHER BEFORE GOING TO WASHINGTON OR UPON ARRIVING AND URGED TO USE THEIR INFLUENCE TO PERSUADE THE ORGANIZATION TO ABANDON ITS WORK FOR THE FREEDOM OF WOMEN AND TURN ITS ACTIVITIES INTO WAR CHANNELS
4088-158077-0003 ALTHOUGH WAR WAS THEN ONLY RUMORED THE HYSTERICAL ATTITUDE WAS ALREADY PREVALENT WOMEN WERE ASKED TO FURL THEIR BANNERS AND GIVE UP THEIR HALF CENTURY STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY TO FORGET THE LIBERTY THAT WAS MOST PRECIOUS TO THEIR HEARTS
4088-158077-0004 THE PRESIDENT WILL TURN THIS IMPERIALISTIC WAR INTO A CRUSADE FOR DEMOCRACY LAY ASIDE YOUR OWN FIGHT AND HELP US CRUSH GERMANY AND YOU WILL FIND YOURSELVES REWARDED WITH A VOTE OUT OF THE NATION'S GRATITUDE WERE SOME OF THE APPEALS MADE TO OUR WOMEN BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HIGH AND LOW
4088-158077-0005 AND BY THE RANK AND FILE OF MEN AND WOMEN NEVER IN HISTORY DID A BAND OF WOMEN STAND TOGETHER WITH MORE SANITY AND GREATER SOLIDARITY THAN DID THESE ONE THOUSAND DELEGATES REPRESENTING THOUSANDS MORE THROUGHOUT THE STATES AS OUR OFFICIAL ORGAN THE SUFFRAGIST
4088-158077-0006 POINTED OUT EDITORIALLY IN ITS ISSUE OF APRIL TWENTY FIRST NINETEEN SEVENTEEN
4088-158077-0007 WE WERE UNITED ON NO OTHER SUBJECT SOME WOULD OFFER PASSIVE RESISTANCE TO THE WAR OTHERS WOULD BECOME DEVOTED FOLLOWERS OF A VIGOROUS MILITARY POLICY BETWEEN THESE EVERY SHADE OF OPINION WAS REPRESENTED EACH WAS LOYAL TO THE IDEAS WHICH SHE HELD FOR HER COUNTRY
4088-158077-0008 HAD NOTHING TO DO IT WAS CONCERNED ONLY WITH THE EFFORT TO OBTAIN FOR WOMEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE EFFECTIVE EXPRESSION THROUGH POLITICAL POWER TO THEIR IDEALS WHATEVER THEY MIGHT BE
4088-158077-0009 THE THOUSAND DELEGATES PRESENT AT THE CONVENTION THOUGH DIFFERING WIDELY ON THE DUTY OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN WAR WERE UNANIMOUS IN VOTING THAT IN THE EVENT OF WAR THE NATIONAL WOMAN'S PARTY AS AN ORGANIZATION SHOULD CONTINUE TO WORK FOR POLITICAL LIBERTY FOR WOMEN AND FOR THAT ALONE
4088-158077-0010 BELIEVING AS THE CONVENTION STATED IN ITS RESOLUTIONS THAT IN SO DOING THE ORGANIZATION SERVES THE HIGHEST INTEREST OF THE COUNTRY
4088-158077-0011 THEY WERE ALSO UNANIMOUS IN THE OPINION THAT ALL SERVICE WHICH INDIVIDUALS WISHED TO GIVE TO WAR OR PEACE SHOULD BE GIVEN THROUGH GROUPS ORGANIZED FOR SUCH PURPOSES
4088-158077-0012 FOR ONE PURPOSE ONLY TO SECURE AN AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION ENFRANCHISING WOMEN WE DECLARED OFFICIALLY THROUGH OUR ORGAN THAT THIS HELD AS THE POLICY OF THE WOMAN'S PARTY WHATEVER TURN PUBLIC EVENTS MAY TAKE
4088-158077-0013 AND ANNOUNCED THAT NO SUBJECTS WOULD BE CONSIDERED BY THEM UNLESS THE PRESIDENT URGED THEM AS WAR MEASURES OUR TASK WAS FROM THAT TIME ON TO MAKE NATIONAL SUFFRAGE A WAR MEASURE WE AT ONCE URGED UPON THE ADMINISTRATION THE WISDOM OF ACCEPTING THIS PROPOSED REFORM AS A WAR MEASURE
4088-158077-0014 AND POINTED OUT THE DIFFICULTY OF WAGING A WAR FOR DEMOCRACY ABROAD WHILE DEMOCRACY WAS DENIED AT HOME BUT THE GOVERNMENT WAS NOT WILLING TO PROFIT BY THE EXPERIENCE OF ITS ALLIES IN EXTENDING SUFFRAGE TO WOMEN WITHOUT FIRST OFFERING A TERRIBLE AND BRUTAL RESISTANCE
4088-158077-0015 WAS MOST PERPLEXING HERE WERE WE CITIZENS WITHOUT POWER AND RECOGNITION WITH THE ONLY WEAPONS TO WHICH A POWERLESS CLASS WHICH DOES NOT TAKE UP ARMS CAN RESORT WE COULD NOT AND WOULD NOT FIGHT WITH MEN'S WEAPONS
4088-158077-0016 COMPARE THE METHODS WOMEN ADOPTED TO THOSE MEN USE IN THE PURSUIT OF DEMOCRACY
4088-158077-0017 BAYONETS MACHINE GUNS POISON GAS DEADLY GRENADES LIQUID FIRE BOMBS ARMORED TANKS PISTOLS BARBED WIRE ENTANGLEMENTS SUBMARINES MINES EVERY KNOWN SCIENTIFIC DEVICE WITH WHICH TO ANNIHILATE THE ENEMY
4088-158077-0018 WHAT DID WE DO WE CONTINUED TO FIGHT WITH OUR SIMPLE PEACEFUL ALMOST QUAINT DEVICE A BANNER A LITTLE MORE FIERY PERHAPS PERTINENT TO THE LATEST POLITICAL CONTROVERSY BUT STILL ONLY A BANNER INSCRIBED WITH MILITANT TRUTH
4088-158077-0019 JUST AS OUR POLITICAL STRATEGY HAD BEEN TO OPPOSE AT ELECTIONS THE PARTY IN POWER WHICH HAD FAILED TO USE ITS POWER TO FREE WOMEN SO NOW OUR MILITARY STRATEGY WAS BASED ON THE MILITARY DOCTRINE OF CONCENTRATING ALL ONE'S FORCES ON THE ENEMY'S WEAKEST POINT
4088-158077-0020 AND THE DENIAL OF DEMOCRACY AT HOME THIS WAS THE UNTENABLE POSITION OF PRESIDENT WILSON AND THE DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION FROM WHICH WE MUST FORCE THEM TO RETREAT WE COULD FORCE SUCH A RETREAT WHEN WE HAD EXPOSED TO THE WORLD THIS WEAKEST POINT
4088-158077-0021 JUST AS THE BLUFF OF A DEMOCRATIC CRUSADE MUST BE CALLED SO MUST THE KNIGHT LEADER OF THE CRUSADE BE EXPOSED TO THE CRITICAL EYES OF THE WORLD
4088-158077-0022 HERE WAS THE CHAMPION OF THEIR DEMOCRATIC ASPIRATIONS HERE WAS A KIND OF UNIVERSAL MOSES EXPECTED TO LEAD ALL PEOPLES OUT OF BONDAGE NO MATTER WHAT THE BONDAGE NO MATTER OF HOW LONG STANDING
4088-158077-0023 IT WAS AN ADVANTAGE TO US IN THAT IT MADE OUR ATTACK MORE DRAMATIC ONE SUPPOSED TO BE IMPECCABLE WAS MORE VULNERABLE IT WAS A DISADVANTAGE TO HAVE TO OVERCOME THIS UNIVERSAL TRUST AND WORLD WIDE POPULARITY
4088-158077-0024 BUT THIS CONFLICT OF WITS AND BRAINS AGAINST POWER ONLY ENHANCED OUR INGENUITY ON THE DAY THE ENGLISH MISSION HEADED BY MISTER BALFOUR AND THE FRENCH MISSION HEADED BY M VIVIANI VISITED THE WHITE HOUSE WE TOOK THESE INSCRIPTIONS TO THE PICKET LINE
4088-158077-0025 IN OUR CAPACITY TO EMBARRASS MISTER WILSON IN HIS ADMINISTRATION LAY OUR ONLY HOPE OF SUCCESS
4088-158077-0026 WE INTENDED TO KNOW WHY IF DEMOCRACY WERE SO PRECIOUS AS TO DEMAND THE NATION'S BLOOD AND TREASURE FOR ITS ACHIEVEMENT ABROAD ITS EXECUTION AT HOME WAS SO UNDESIRABLE MEANWHILE
4088-158077-0027 I TELL YOU SOLEMNLY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE CANNOT ANY LONGER POSTPONE JUSTICE IN THESE UNITED STATES
4088-158077-0028 AND IF HE DOESN'T LISTEN TO MY ADVICE I AM GOING TO MAKE IT AS UNPLEASANT AS I CAN PRESIDENT WILSON
4088-158077-0029 SOME RUMBLINGS OF POLITICAL ACTION BEGAN TO BE HEARD THE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY HAD APPOINTED A SENATE COMMITTEE ON WOMAN SUFFRAGE WHOSE MEMBERS WERE OVERWHELMINGLY FOR FEDERAL ACTION THE CHAIRMAN SENATOR ANDREAS JONES OF NEW MEXICO
4088-158077-0030 PROMISED AN EARLY REPORT TO THE SENATE THERE WERE SCORES OF GAINS IN CONGRESS REPRESENTATIVES AND SENATORS WERE TUMBLING OVER EACH OTHER TO INTRODUCE SIMILAR SUFFRAGE RESOLUTIONS WE ACTUALLY HAD DIFFICULTY IN CHOOSING THE MAN WHOSE NAME SHOULD STAMP OUR MEASURE
4088-158077-0031 IN ADDITION TO THIS PLANK THEY ADOPTED A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF DEMOCRACY AT HOME
4088-158077-0032 AND INSTRUCTING THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CONVENTION TO REQUEST A COMMITTEE CONSISTING OF REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL LIBERAL GROUPS
4088-158077-0033 THEY APPOINTED A COMMITTEE FROM THE CONVENTION TO CARRY THESE RESOLUTIONS TO THE PRESIDENT THE COMMITTEE INCLUDED MISTER J A H HOPKINS OF THE PROGRESSIVE PARTY AS CHAIRMAN
4088-158077-0034 MISTER JOHN SPARGO OF THE SOCIALIST PARTY MISTER VIRGIL HINSHAW CHAIRMAN OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PROHIBITION PARTY AND MISS MABEL VERNON SECRETARY OF THE NATIONAL WOMAN'S PARTY
4088-158077-0035 THE PRESIDENT WAS DEEPLY MOVED INDEED ALMOST TO THE POINT OF TEARS WHEN MISS MABEL VERNON SAID MISTER PRESIDENT THE FEELINGS OF MANY WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY ARE BEST EXPRESSED BY YOUR OWN WORDS IN YOUR WAR MESSAGE TO CONGRESS
4088-158077-0036 WE WERE NOT PRIMARILY INTERESTED IN THE AMPLIFICATION OF CONGRESSIONAL MACHINERY UNLESS THIS AMPLIFICATION WAS TO BE FOLLOWED BY THE PASSAGE OF THE AMENDMENT THE PRESIDENT COULD AS EASILY HAVE WRITTEN THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON SUFFRAGE OR THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE
4088-158077-0037 ADVISING AN IMMEDIATE REPORT ON THE SUFFRAGE RESOLUTION AS HAVE ASKED FOR THE CREATION OF ANOTHER COMMITTEE TO REPORT ON THE SUBJECT HE MADE NO MENTION OF HIS STATE BY STATE CONVICTION HOWEVER AS HE HAD IN PREVIOUS INTERVIEWS
4088-158077-0038 AND THE COMMITTEE OF PROGRESSIVES UNDERSTOOD HIM TO HAVE AT LEAST TACITLY ACCEPTED FEDERAL ACTION THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CONTINUED TO REFUSE TO ACT AND THE HOUSE RULES COMMITTEE STEADILY REFUSED TO CREATE A SUFFRAGE COMMITTEE
4088-158077-0039 HOPING TO WIN BACK TO THE FOLD THE WANDERING PROGRESSIVES WHO HAD THUS DEMONSTRATED THEIR ALLEGIANCE TO SUFFRAGE AND SEEING AN OPPORTUNITY TO EMBARRASS THE ADMINISTRATION THE REPUBLICANS BEGAN TO INTEREST THEMSELVES IN ACTION ON THE AMENDMENT
4088-158077-0040 THE AUTHORIZATION OF AN EXPENDITURE OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE ERECTION OF A MONUMENT TO A DEAD PRESIDENT AS A LEGITIMATE WAR MEASURE IT WAS CLEAR FROM THE PARTISAN ATTITUDE OF THOSE WHO TOOK PART IN THE DEBATE
4088-158077-0041 THAT WE WERE ADVANCING TO THAT POSITION WHERE WE WERE AS GOOD POLITICAL MATERIAL TO BE CONTESTED OVER BY OPPOSING POLITICAL GROUPS AS WAS A MONUMENT TO A DEAD PRESIDENT AND IF THE DEMOCRATS COULD DEFEND SUCH AN ISSUE AS A WAR MEASURE
4088-158077-0042 THE ADMINISTRATION WAS AROUSED IT DID NOT KNOW HOW FAR THE REPUBLICANS WERE PREPARED TO GO IN THEIR DRIVE FOR ACTION SO ON THE DAY OF THIS FLURRY IN THE HOUSE THE SNAIL LIKE RULES COMMITTEE
4088-158077-0043 AND BY A VOTE OF SIX TO FIVE DECIDED TO REPORT FAVORABLY ON THE RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR A WOMAN SUFFRAGE COMMITTEE IN THE HOUSE AFTER ALL PENDING WAR MEASURES HAVE BEEN DISPOSED OF BEFORE THE MEETING
4088-158077-0044 THE PICKETS CONTINUED THEIR VIGIL AND THE MOTION CARRIED STILL UNCERTAIN AS TO THE PURPOSES OF THE REPUBLICANS THE DEMOCRATS WERE MOVED TO FURTHER ACTION
4088-158077-0045 MEETING IN WASHINGTON A FEW DAYS LATER VOTED FOUR TO NINE TO OFFICIALLY URGE UPON THE PRESIDENT THAT HE CALL THE TWO HOUSES OF CONGRESS TOGETHER AND RECOMMEND THE IMMEDIATE SUBMISSION OF THE SUSAN B ANTHONY AMENDMENT THIS ACTION WHICH IN EFFECT REVERSED THE PLANK IN THE DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM
4088-158077-0046 EVIDENTLY AROUSED PROTESTS FROM POWERFUL QUARTERS ALSO THE REPUBLICANS QUICKLY SUBSIDED WHEN THEY SAW THE DEMOCRATS MAKING AN ADVANCE AND SO THE DEMOCRATIC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE BEGAN TO SPREAD ABROAD THE NEWS THAT ITS ACT WAS NOT REALLY OFFICIAL
4088-158077-0047 BUT MERELY REFLECTED THE PERSONAL CONVICTION OF THE MEMBERS PRESENT IT EXTRACTED THE OFFICIAL FLAVOR AND SO OF COURSE NO ACTION FOLLOWED IN CONGRESS AND SO IT WENT LIKE A GREAT GAME OF CHESS
4088-158077-0048 THE FACT WAS THAT THE PICKETS HAD MOVED THE DEMOCRATS A STEP
4088-158077-0049 BEHIND THIS MATCHING OF POLITICAL WITS BY THE TWO PARTIES STOOD THE FAITHFUL PICKETS COMPELLING THEM BOTH TO ACT SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THESE MOVES AND COUNTER MOVES IN POLITICAL CIRCLES THE PEOPLE IN ALL SECTIONS OF THIS VAST COUNTRY BEGAN TO SPEAK THEIR MINDS
4088-158077-0050 MEETINGS WERE SPRINGING UP EVERYWHERE AT WHICH RESOLUTIONS WERE PASSED BACKING UP THE PICKET LINE AND URGING THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS TO ACT EVEN THE SOUTH THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRONGHOLD SENT FIERY TELEGRAMS DEMANDING ACTION
4088-158077-0051 ALABAMA SOUTH CAROLINA TEXAS MARYLAND MISSISSIPPI AS WELL AS THE WEST MIDDLE WEST NEW ENGLAND AND THE EAST THE STREAM WAS ENDLESS EVERY TIME A NEW PIECE OF LEGISLATION WAS PASSED THE WAR TAX BILL
4088-158077-0052 FOOD CONSERVATION OR WHAT NOT WOMEN FROM UNEX PECTED QUARTERS SENT TO THE GOVERNMENT THEIR PROTEST AGAINST THE PASSAGE OF MEASURES SO VITAL TO WOMEN WITHOUT WOMEN'S CONSENT COUPLED WITH AN APPEAL FOR THE LIBERATION OF WOMEN
4088-158077-0053 CLUB WOMEN COLLEGE WOMEN FEDERATIONS OF LABOR VARIOUS KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS SENT PROTESTS TO THE ADMINISTRATION LEADERS THE PICKET LINE APPROACHING ITS SIXTH MONTH OF DUTY HAD AROUSED THE COUNTRY TO AN UNPRECEDENTED INTEREST IN SUF FRAGE
4088-158077-0054 IT HAD RALLIED WIDESPREAD PUBLIC SUPPORT TO THE AMEND MENT AS A WAR MEASURE AND HAD ITSELF BECOME ALMOST UNIVER SALLY ACCEPTED IF NOT UNIVERSALLY APPROVED AND IN THE MIDST OF PICKETING ANDS IN SPITE OF ALL THE PROPHECIES AND FEARS THAT PICKETING WOULD SET BACK THE CAUSE
4088-158077-0055 WITHIN ONE MONTH MICHIGAN NEBRASKA AND RHODE ISLAND GRANTED PRESIDENTIAL SUFFRAGE TO WOMEN THE LEADERS WERE BUSY MARSHALING THEIR FORCES BEHIND THE PRESIDENT'S WAR PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDED THE CONTROVERSIAL CONSCRIPTION AND ESPIONAGE BILLS THEN PENDING
4088-158077-0056 AND DID NOT RELISH HAVING OUR QUESTION SO VIVID IN THE PUBLIC MIND
4088-158077-0057 THEY HAD TO FACE A POSSIBLE CHARGE OF INCONSISTENCY INSINCERITY OR BAD FAITH THE FREEDOM OF IRELAND FOR EXAMPLE WAS NOT IN THE PROGRAM
4088-158077-0058 THE MANIFESTATIONS OF POPULAR APPROVAL OF SUFFRAGE THE CONSTANT STREAM OF PROTESTS TO THE ADMINISTRATION AGAINST ITS DELAY NATIONALLY AND THE SHAME OF HAVING WOMEN BEGGING AT ITS GATES COULD RESULT IN ONLY ONE OF TWO THINGS
4088-158077-0059 THE ADMINISTRATION HAD LITTLE CHOICE IT MUST YIELD TO THIS PRESSURE FROM THE PEOPLE OR IT MUST SUPPRESS THE AGITATION WHICH WAS CAUSING SUCH INTEREST IT MUST PASS THE AMENDMENT OR REMOVE THE TROUBLESOME PICKETS IT DECIDED TO REMOVE THE PICKETS
4088-158077-0060 THE FIRST ARRESTS THE ADMINISTRATION CHOSE SUPPRESSION THEY RESORTED TO FORCE IN AN ATTEMPT TO END PICKETING IT WAS A POLICY DOOMED TO FAILURE AS CERTAINLY AS ALL RESORTS TO FORCE TO KILL AGITATION HAVE FAILED ULTIMATELY
4088-158077-0061 THIS MARKED THE BEGINNING OF THE ADOPTION BY THE ADMINISTRATION OF TACTICS FROM WHICH THEY COULD NEVER EXTRICATE THEMSELVES WITH HONOR UNFORTUNATELY FOR THEM THEY WERE ENTERING UPON THIS POLICY TOWARD WOMEN WHICH SAVORED OF CZARIST PRACTICES
4088-158077-0062 AT THE VERY MOMENT THEY WERE CONGRATULATING THE RUSSIANS UPON THEIR LIBERATION FROM THE OPPRESSION OF A CZAR THIS FACT SUPPLIED US WITH A FRESH ANGLE OF ATTACK PRESIDENT WILSON SENT A MISSION TO RUSSIA TO ADD AMERICA'S APPEAL TO THAT OF THE OTHER ALLIES TO KEEP THAT IMPOVERISHED COUNTRY IN THE WAR
4088-158077-0063 SUCH WAS OUR DEMOCRATIC ZEAL TO PERSUADE RUSSIA TO CONTINUE THE WAR AND TO CONVINCE HER PEOPLE OF ITS DEMOCRATIC PURPOSES AND OF THE DEMOCRATIC QUALITY OF AMERICA
4088-158077-0064 THIS OCCASION OFFERED US THE OPPORTUNITY AGAIN TO EXPOSE THE ADMINISTRATION'S WEAKNESS IN CLAIMING COMPLETE POLITICAL DEMOCRACY WHILE WOMEN WERE STILL DENIED THEIR POLITICAL FREEDOM
4088-158077-0065 AS THE CAR CARRYING THE ENVOYS PASSED SWIFTLY THROUGH THE GATES OF THE WHITE HOUSE THERE STOOD ON THE PICKET LINE TWO SILENT SENTINELS MISS LUCY BURNS OF NEW YORK AND MISSUS LAWRENCE LEWIS OF PHILADELPHIA BOTH MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
4088-158077-0066 WITH A GREAT LETTERED BANNER WHICH READ TO THE RUSSIAN ENVOYS PRESIDENT WILSON AND ENVOY ROOT ARE DECEIVING RUSSIA WHEN THEY SAY WE ARE A DEMOCRACY HELP US WIN THE WORLD WAR SO THAT DEMOCRACY MAY SURVIVE WE THE WOMEN OF AMERICA
4088-158077-0067 TWENTY MILLION AMERI CAN WOMEN ARE DENIED THE RIGHT TO VOTE PRESI DENT WILSON IS THE CHIEF OPPONENT OF THEIR NA TIONAL ENFRANCHISEMENT HELP US MAKE THIS NATION REALLY FREE TELL OUR GOVERNMENT IT MUST LIBERATE ITS PEOPLE BEFORE IT CAN CLAIM FREE RUSSIA AS AN ALLY
4088-158077-0068 RUMORS THAT THE SUFFRAGISTS WOULD MAKE A SPECIAL DEMONSTRATION BEFORE THE RUSSIAN MISSION HAD BROUGHT A GREAT CROWD TO THE FAR GATE OF THE WHITE HOUSE A CROWD COMPOSED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF MEN
4088-158077-0069 LIKE ALL CROWDS THIS CROWD HAD ITS SHARE OF HOODLUMS AND ROUGHS WHO TRIED TO INTERFERE WITH THE WOMEN'S ORDER OF THE DAY THERE WAS A FLURRY OF EXCITEMENT OVER THIS DEFIANT MESSAGE OF TRUTH BUT NOTHING THAT COULD NOT WITH THE UTMOST EASE HAVE BEEN SETTLED BY ONE POLICEMAN
4088-158077-0070 THERE WAS THE CRITICISM IN THE PRESS AND ON THE LIPS OF MEN THAT WE WERE EMBARRASSING OUR GOVERNMENT BEFORE THE EYES OF FOREIGN VISITORS IN ANSWERING THE CRITICISM MISS PAUL PUBLICLY STATED OUR POSITION THUS
4088-158077-0071 CAN BE CHANGED IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR PROTEST IS THEREFORE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND NOT WITH THE WOMEN OF AMERICA IF THE LACK OF DEMOCRACY AT HOME WEAKENS THE ADMINISTRATION
4088-158077-0072 IN ITS FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY THREE THOUSAND MILES AWAY THIS WAS TOO DREADFUL A FLURRY AT THE GATES OF THE CHIEF OF THE NATION AT SUCH A TIME WOULD NEVER DO OUR ALLIES IN THE CRUSADE FOR DEMOCRACY MUST NOT KNOW THAT WE HAD A DAY BY DAY UNREST AT HOME
4088-158077-0073 WHAT A PICTURE COMMON DECENCY TOLD THE MORE HUMANE LEADERS THAT THIS WOULD NEVER DO I DARESAY POLITICAL WISDOM CREPT INTO THE REASONING OF OTHERS CLOSING THE WOMAN'S PARTY HEADQUARTERS WAS DISCUSSED PERHAPS A RAID AND ALL FOR WHAT
4088-158077-0074 BECAUSE WOMEN WERE HOLDING BANNERS ASKING FOR THE PRECIOUS PRINCIPLE AT HOME THAT MEN WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DYING FOR ABROAD FINALLY A DECISION WAS REACHED EMBODYING THE COMBINED WISDOM OF ALL THE VARIOUS CONFEREES
4088-158077-0075 THE CHIEF OF POLICE MAJOR PULLMAN WAS DETAILED TO REQUEST US TO STOP PICKETING AND TO TELL US THAT IF WE CONTINUED TO PICKET WE WOULD BE ARRESTED WE HAVE PICKETED FOR SIX MONTHS WITHOUT INTERFERENCE SAID MISS PAUL HAS THE LAW BEEN CHANGED
4088-158077-0076 NO WAS THE REPLY BUT YOU MUST STOP IT
4088-158077-0077 THE FOLLOWING DAY MISS LUCY BURNS AND MISS KATHERINE MOREY OF BOSTON CARRIED TO THE WHITE HOUSE GATES WE SHALL FIGHT FOR THE THINGS WE HAVE ALWAYS HELD NEAREST OUR HEARTS FOR DEMOCRACY FOR THE RIGHT OF THOSE WHO SUBMIT TO AUTHORITY
4088-158077-0078 TO HAVE A VOICE IN THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT
4088-158077-0079 NEWS HAD SPREAD THROUGH THE CITY THAT THE PICKETS WERE TO BE ARRESTED A MODERATELY LARGE CROWD HAD GATHERED TO SEE THE FUN ONE HAS ONLY TO COME INTO CONFLICT WITH PREVAILING AUTHORITY WHETHER RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY TO FIND FRIENDLY HOSTS VANISHING WITH LIGHTNING SPEED
4088-158077-0080 TO KNOW THAT WE WERE NO LONGER WANTED AT THE GATES OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND THAT THE POLICE WERE NO LONGER OUR FRIENDS WAS ENOUGH FOR THE MOB MIND SOME MEMBERS OF THE CROWD MADE SPORT OF THE WOMEN OTHERS HURLED CHEAP AND CHILDISH EPITHETS AT THEM SMALL BOYS WERE ALLOWED TO CAPTURE SOUVENIRS
4088-158077-0081 AS TROPHIES OF THE SPORT THINKING THEY HAD BEEN MISTAKEN IN BELIEVING THE PICKETS WERE TO BE ARRESTED AND HAVING GROWN WEARY OF THEIR STRENUOUS SPORT THE CROWD MOVED ON ITS WAY TWO SOLITARY FIGURES REMAINED STANDING ON THE SIDEWALK FLANKED BY THE VAST PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE
4088-158077-0082 UPON KNOWING THE CHARGE AGAINST THEM MAJOR PULLMAN AND HIS ENTIRE STAFF WERE UTTERLY AT A LOSS TO KNOW WHAT TO ANSWER THE ADMINISTRATION HAD LOOKED AHEAD ONLY AS FAR AS THREATENING ARREST THEY DOUBTLESS THOUGHT THIS WAS ALL THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO
4088-158077-0083 AND NEVER BROUGHT TO TRIAL THE FOLLOWING DAY JUNE TWENTY THIRD MORE ARRESTS WERE MADE TWO WOMEN AT THE WHITE HOUSE TWO AT THE CAPITOL ALL CARRIED BANNERS WITH THE SAME WORDS OF THE PRESIDENT THERE WAS NO HESITATION THIS TIME THEY WERE PROMPTLY ARRESTED FOR OBSTRUCTING THE TRAFFIC
4088-158077-0084 THEY TOO WERE DISMISSED AND THEIR CASES NEVER TRIED
4088-158077-0085 WHEN HOWEVER WOMEN CONTINUED TO PICKET IN THE FACE OF ARREST THE ADMINISTRATION QUICKENED ITS ADVANCE INTO THE VENTURE OF SUPPRESSION IT DECIDED TO BRING THE OFFENDERS TO TRIAL ON JUNE TWENTY SIXTH
4088-158077-0086 TO PAY A FINE WOULD BE AN ADMISSION OF GUILT WE ARE INNOCENT THE SIX WOMEN WHO WERE PRIVILEGED TO SERVE THE FIRST TERMS OF IMPRISONMENT FOR SUFFRAGE IN THIS COUNTRY WERE MISS KATHERINE MOREY OF MASSACHUSETTS MISSUS ANNIE ARNEIL
4088-158077-0087 AND MISS MABEL VERNON OF DELAWARE MISS LAVINIA DOCK OF PENNSYLVANIA MISS MAUD
4088-158077-0088 INDEPENDENCE DAY JULY FOURTH NINETEEN SEVENTEEN IS THE OCCASION FOR TWO DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE NAME OF LIBERTY CHAMP CLARK LATE DEMOCRATIC SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE IS DECLAIMING TO A CHEERING CROWD BEHIND THE WHITE HOUSE
4088-158077-0089 GOVERNMENTS DERIVE THEIR JUST POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE THIRTEEN SILENT SENTINELS WITH BANNERS BEARING THE SAME WORDS ARE ARRESTED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EXCEEDINGLY DROLL IF IT HAD NOT BEEN SO TRAGIC
4088-158077-0090 CHAMP CLARK AND HIS THRONG WERE NOT MOLESTED THE WOMEN WITH PRACTICALLY A DESERTED STREET WERE ARRESTED AND SERVED JAIL TERMS FOR OBSTRUCTING TRAFFIC THE TRIAL OF THIS GROUP WAS DELAYED TO GIVE THE JAIL AUTHORITIES TIME TO VACATE AND TIDY UP
4088-158077-0091 AS ONE PRISONER CONFIDED TO MISS JOY YOUNG IT DEVELOPED THAT ORDERS HAD BEEN RECEIVED AT THE JAIL IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ARRESTS AND BEFORE THE TRIAL TO MAKE READY FOR THE SUFFRAGETTES WHAT DID IT MATTER THAT THEIR CASE HAD NOT YET BEEN HEARD
4088-158077-0092 AND WAS NOT THE CHIEF OF POLICE OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA A DIRECT APPOINTEE OF THESE SAME COMMISSIONERS AND WAS NOT THE JAIL WARDEN WHO MADE LIFE FOR THE WOMEN SO UNBEARABLE IN PRISON ALSO A DIRECT APPOINTEE OF THE COMMISSIONERS
4088-158077-0093 IT WAS ALL A MERRY LITTLE RING AND ITS CAVALIER ATTITUDE TOWARD THE LAW TOWARD JUSTICE AND ABOVE ALL TOWARD WOMEN WAS OF NO IMPORTANCE THE WORLD WAS ON FIRE WITH A GRAND BLAZE THIS TINY FLAME WOULD SCARCELY BE VISIBLE
4088-158077-0094 CHAIRMAN FURNISHED WITHOUT CHARGE TO ALL NEWSPAPERS POST OFFICES GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND AGENCIES OF A PUBLIC CHARACTER FOR THE DISSEMINATION OF OFFICIAL NEWS OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WASHINGTON JULY THIRD NINETEEN SEVENTEEN
4088-158077-0095 AND REPORTERS NOT TO ENCOURAGE US IN OUR PECULIAR CONDUCT BY PRINTING DEFIES TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES EVEN WHEN FLAUNTED ON A PRETTY LITTLE PURPLE AND GOLD BANNER AND EXHORTS THE PUBLIC TO CONTROL ITS THRILLS
4088-158077-0096 THE OFFICIAL BULLETIN CONCLUDES WITH IT IS A FACT THAT THERE REMAINS IN AMERICA ONE MAN WHO HAS KNOWN EXACTLY THE RIGHT ATTITUDE TO TAKE AND MAINTAIN TOWARD THE PICKETS
4088-158077-0097 A POLITE BOW AND FOR THE REST A COMPLETE IGNORING OF THEIR EXISTENCE HE HAPPENS TO BE THE MAN AROUND WHOM THE LITTLE WHIRLWIND
4088-158077-0098 AND FINALLY WITH AN ADMONITION THAT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY
4088-158079-0000 AUGUST RIOTS IMPRISONING WOMEN HAD MET WITH CONSIDERABLE PUBLIC DISAPPROVAL AND ATTENDANT POLITICAL EMBARRASSMENT TO THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL PARDON WOULD END THIS EMBARRASSMENT WAS DOUBTLESS THE HOPE OF THE ADMINISTRATION
4088-158079-0001 THE PICKETS HOWEVER RETURNED TO THEIR POSTS IN STEADILY INCREASING NUMBERS THEIR PRESENCE AT THE GATES WAS DESIRED BY THE ADMINISTRATION NO MORE NOW THAN IT HAD BEEN BEFORE THE ARRESTS AND IMPRISONMENTS BUT THEY HAD FOUND NO WAY TO RID THEMSELVES OF THE PICKETS
4088-158079-0002 AND AS ANOTHER MONTH OF PICKETING DREW TO AN END THE ADMINISTRATION VENTURED TO TRY OTHER WAYS TO STOP IT AND WITH IT THE CONSEQUENT EMBARRASSMENT THEIR METHODS BECAME PHYSICALLY MORE BRUTAL AND POLITICALLY MORE STUPID THEIR CONDUCT
4088-158079-0003 BECAME LAWLESS IN THE EXTREME MEANWHILE THE PRESIDENT HAD DRAFTED THE YOUNG MEN OF AMERICA IN THEIR MILLIONS TO DIE ON FOREIGN SOIL FOR FOREIGN DEMOCRACY HE HAD ISSUED A SPECIAL APPEAL TO WOMEN TO GIVE THEIR WORK THEIR TREASURE AND THEIR SONS TO THIS ENTERPRISE
4088-158079-0004 AT THE SAME TIME HIS NOW GIGANTIC FIGURE STOOD OBSTINATELY ACROSS THE PATH TO OUR MAIN OBJECTIVE IT WAS OUR DAILY TASK TO KEEP VIVIDLY IN HIS MIND THAT OBJECTIVE IT WAS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO COMPEL DECISIVE ACTION FROM HIM
4088-158079-0005 TWENTY MILLION AMERICAN WOMEN ARE NOT SELF GOVERNED TAKE THE BEAM OUT OF YOUR OWN EYE WE DID NOT EXPECT PUBLIC SYMPATHY AT THIS POINT WE KNEW THAT NOT EVEN THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO HAD OCCASIONALLY IN DEBATE BUT MORE FREQUENTLY IN THEIR CLOAK ROOMS
4088-158079-0006 PRESIDENT AND MISSUS WILSON PASSED THROUGH THE GATES ON THEIR WAY TO A MILITARY REVIEW AT FORT MYER THE PRESIDENT SAW AMERICAN WOMEN BEING ATTACKED WHILE THE POLICE REFUSED THEM PROTECTION NOT A MOVE WAS MADE BY THE POLICE TO CONTROL THE GROWING CROWD
4088-158079-0007 SUCH INACTION IS ALWAYS A SIGNAL FOR MORE VIOLENCE ON THE PART OF ROWDIES AS THE THRONG MOVED TO AND FRO BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND OUR HEADQUARTERS IMMEDIATELY OPPOSITE SO MANY BANNERS WERE DESTROYED THAT FINALLY MISS LUCY BURNS MISS VIRGINIA ARNOLD
4088-158079-0008 AND MISS ELIZABETH STUYVESANT TOOK THOSE REMAINING TO THE SECOND AND THIRD FLOOR BALCONIES OF OUR BUILDING AND HUNG THEM OUT AT THIS POINT THERE WAS NOT A PICKET LEFT ON THE STREET THE CROWD WAS CLEARLY OBSTRUCTING THE TRAFFIC BUT NO ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO MOVE THEM BACK OR TO PROTECT THE WOMEN
4088-158079-0009 CLIMBED UP TO THE SECOND FLOOR BALCONY MOUNTED THE IRON RAILING AND TORE DOWN ALL BANNERS AND THE AMERICAN FLAG ONE SAILOR ADMINISTERED A SEVERE BLOW IN THE FACE WITH HIS CLENCHED FIST UPON MISS GEORGINA STURGIS OF WASHINGTON WHY DID YOU DO THAT SHE DEMANDED
4088-158079-0010 AND STILL NO ATTEMPT BY THE POLICE TO QUELL THE RIOT THE CLIMAX CAME WHEN IN THE LATE AFTERNOON A BULLET WAS FIRED THROUGH ONE OF THE HEAVY GLASS WINDOWS OF THE SECOND FLOOR EMBEDDING ITSELF IN THE CEILING THE BULLET GRAZED PAST THE HEAD OF MISSUS ELLA MORTON DEAN OF MONTANA
4088-158079-0011 CAPTAIN FLATHER OF THE FIRST PRECINCT WITH TWO DETECTIVES LATER EXAMINED THE HOLES AND DECLARED THEY HAD BEEN MADE BY A THIRTY EIGHT CALIBER REVOLVER
4088-158079-0012 BUT THE POLICE LOOKED ON WHILE ALL THE BANNERS WERE DESTROYED A FEW PACES FROM HEADQUARTERS MORE BANNERS WENT OUT PURPLE WHITE AND GOLD ONES THEY TOO WERE DESTROYED BEFORE THEY REACHED THE WHITE HOUSE
4088-158079-0013 THIS ENTIRE SPECTACLE WAS ENACTED ON AUGUST FOURTEENTH WITHIN A STONE'S THROW OF THE WHITE HOUSE MISS PAUL SUMMED UP THE SITUATION WHEN SHE SAID THE SITUATION NOW EXISTING IN WASHINGTON EXISTS BECAUSE PRESIDENT WILSON PERMITS IT
4088-158079-0014 ASKING QUESTIONS MAKING BRIEF TESTIMONIALS FROM THE FLOOR WITH ALMOST EVANGELICAL FERVOR IMPROVISED COLLECTION BASKETS WERE PILED HIGH WITH BILLS WOMEN VOLUNTEERED FOR PICKET DUTY AND CERTAIN IMPRISONMENT
4088-158079-0015 AND THE FOLLOWING DAY A DELEGATION LEFT FOR WASHINGTON I CITE THIS EXPERIENCE OF MINE BECAUSE IT WAS TYPICAL EVERY ONE WHO WENT THROUGH THE COUNTRY TELLING THE STORY HAD SIMILAR EXPERIENCES AT THIS TIME INDIGNATION WAS SWIFT AND HOT
4088-158079-0016 OUR MASS MEETINGS EVERYWHERE BECAME MEETINGS OF PROTEST DURING THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN AND RESOLUTIONS OF PROTEST WHICH ALWAYS WENT IMMEDIATELY BY WIRE FROM SUCH MEETINGS TO THE PRESIDENT HIS CABINET AND TO HIS LEADERS IN CONGRESS OF COURSE CREATED INCREASING
4088-158079-0017 UNEASINESS IN DEMOCRATIC CIRCLES ON AUGUST FIFTEENTH THE PICKETS AGAIN ATTEMPTED TO TAKE THEIR POSTS ON THE LINE ON THIS DAY ONE LETTERED BANNER AND FIFTY PURPLE WHITE AND GOLD FLAGS WERE DESTROYED BY A MOB LED BY SAILORS IN UNIFORM
4088-158079-0018 BY A SAILOR WHO TOOK HER FLAG AND THEN DARTED OFF INTO THE CROWD MISS ELIZABETH STUYVESANT WAS STRUCK BY A SOLDIER IN UNIFORM AND HER BLOUSE TORN FROM HER BODY MISS MAUD JAMISON OF VIRGINIA WAS KNOCKED DOWN AND DRAGGED ALONG THE SIDEWALK
412-126975-0000 THE FLYING STARS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CRIME I EVER COMMITTED FLAMBEAU WOULD SAY IN HIS HIGHLY MORAL OLD AGE
412-126975-0001 WAS ALSO BY A SINGULAR COINCIDENCE MY LAST IT WAS COMMITTED AT CHRISTMAS AS AN ARTIST
412-126975-0002 I HAD ALWAYS ATTEMPTED TO PROVIDE CRIMES SUITABLE TO THE SPECIAL SEASON OR LANDSCAPES IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF CHOOSING THIS OR THAT TERRACE OR GARDEN FOR A CATASTROPHE AS IF FOR A STATUARY GROUP
412-126975-0003 THUS SQUIRES SHOULD BE SWINDLED IN LONG ROOMS PANELLED WITH OAK WHILE JEWS ON THE OTHER HAND SHOULD RATHER FIND THEMSELVES UNEXPECTEDLY PENNILESS
412-126975-0004 AMONG THE LIGHTS AND SCREENS OF THE CAFE RICHE THUS IN ENGLAND IF I WISHED TO RELIEVE A DEAN OF HIS RICHES WHICH IS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MIGHT SUPPOSE I WISHED TO FRAME HIM
412-126975-0005 IF I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR IN THE GREEN LAWNS AND GREY TOWERS OF SOME CATHEDRAL TOWN SIMILARLY IN FRANCE WHEN I HAD GOT MONEY OUT OF A RICH AND WICKED PEASANT
412-126975-0006 WHICH IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE IT GRATIFIED ME TO GET HIS INDIGNANT HEAD RELIEVED AGAINST A GREY LINE OF CLIPPED POPLARS AND THOSE SOLEMN PLAINS OF GAUL OVER WHICH BROODS THE MIGHTY SPIRIT OF MILLET
412-126975-0007 WELL MY LAST CRIME WAS A CHRISTMAS CRIME A CHEERY COSY ENGLISH MIDDLE CLASS CRIME A CRIME OF CHARLES DICKENS
412-126975-0008 I DID IT IN A GOOD OLD MIDDLE CLASS HOUSE NEAR PUTNEY A HOUSE WITH A CRESCENT OF CARRIAGE DRIVE A HOUSE WITH A STABLE BY THE SIDE OF IT A HOUSE WITH THE NAME ON THE TWO OUTER GATES
412-126975-0009 A HOUSE WITH A MONKEY TREE ENOUGH YOU KNOW THE SPECIES I REALLY THINK MY IMITATION OF DICKENS'S STYLE WAS DEXTEROUS AND LITERARY IT SEEMS ALMOST A PITY
412-126975-0010 I REPENTED THE SAME EVENING FLAMBEAU WOULD THEN PROCEED TO TELL THE STORY FROM THE INSIDE AND EVEN FROM THE INSIDE IT WAS ODD SEEN FROM THE OUTSIDE
412-126975-0011 IT WAS PERFECTLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND IT IS FROM THE OUTSIDE THAT THE STRANGER MUST STUDY IT FROM THIS STANDPOINT THE DRAMA MAY BE SAID TO HAVE BEGUN WHEN THE FRONT DOORS OF THE HOUSE WITH THE STABLE
412-126975-0012 OPENED ON THE GARDEN WITH THE MONKEY TREE AND A YOUNG GIRL CAME OUT WITH BREAD TO FEED THE BIRDS ON THE AFTERNOON OF BOXING DAY SHE HAD A PRETTY FACE WITH BRAVE BROWN EYES
412-126975-0013 BUT HER FIGURE WAS BEYOND CONJECTURE FOR SHE WAS SO WRAPPED UP IN BROWN FURS THAT IT WAS HARD TO SAY WHICH WAS HAIR AND WHICH WAS FUR BUT FOR THE ATTRACTIVE FACE SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SMALL TODDLING BEAR
412-126975-0014 THE WINTER AFTERNOON WAS REDDENING TOWARDS EVENING AND ALREADY A RUBY LIGHT WAS ROLLED OVER THE BLOOMLESS BEDS FILLING THEM AS IT WERE WITH THE GHOSTS OF THE DEAD ROSES
412-126975-0015 ON ONE SIDE OF THE HOUSE STOOD THE STABLE ON THE OTHER AN ALLEY OR CLOISTER OF LAURELS LED TO THE LARGER GARDEN BEHIND THE YOUNG LADY HAVING SCATTERED BREAD FOR THE BIRDS
412-126975-0016 FOR THE FOURTH OR FIFTH TIME THAT DAY BECAUSE THE DOG ATE IT PASSED UNOBTRUSIVELY DOWN THE LANE OF LAURELS AND INTO A GLIMMERING PLANTATION OF EVERGREENS BEHIND
412-126975-0017 HERE SHE GAVE AN EXCLAMATION OF WONDER REAL OR RITUAL AND LOOKING UP AT THE HIGH GARDEN WALL ABOVE HER BEHELD IT FANTASTICALLY BESTRIDDEN BY A SOMEWHAT FANTASTIC FIGURE
412-126975-0018 OH DON'T JUMP MISTER CROOK SHE CALLED OUT IN SOME ALARM IT'S MUCH TOO HIGH THE INDIVIDUAL RIDING THE PARTY WALL LIKE AN AERIAL HORSE
412-126975-0019 WAS A TALL ANGULAR YOUNG MAN WITH DARK HAIR STICKING UP LIKE A HAIR BRUSH INTELLIGENT AND EVEN DISTINGUISHED LINEAMENTS BUT A SALLOW AND ALMOST ALIEN COMPLEXION
412-126975-0020 THIS SHOWED THE MORE PLAINLY BECAUSE HE WORE AN AGGRESSIVE RED TIE THE ONLY PART OF HIS COSTUME OF WHICH HE SEEMED TO TAKE ANY CARE PERHAPS IT WAS A SYMBOL

412-126975-0032 AND BEGAN TO UNPACK HIM LIKE SOME VERY CAREFULLY PROTECTED PARCEL RUGS ENOUGH TO STOCK A BAZAAR FURS OF ALL THE BEASTS OF THE FOREST AND SCARVES OF ALL THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW
412-126975-0033 WERE UNWRAPPED ONE BY ONE TILL THEY REVEALED SOMETHING RESEMBLING THE HUMAN FORM THE FORM OF A FRIENDLY BUT FOREIGN LOOKING OLD GENTLEMAN WITH A GREY GOAT LIKE BEARD AND A BEAMING SMILE
412-126975-0034 WHO RUBBED HIS BIG FUR GLOVES TOGETHER LONG BEFORE THIS REVELATION WAS COMPLETE THE TWO BIG DOORS OF THE PORCH HAD OPENED IN THE MIDDLE AND COLONEL ADAMS FATHER OF THE FURRY YOUNG LADY
412-126975-0035 HAD COME OUT HIMSELF TO INVITE HIS EMINENT GUEST INSIDE HE WAS A TALL SUNBURNT AND VERY SILENT MAN WHO WORE A RED SMOKING CAP LIKE A FEZ MAKING HIM LOOK LIKE ONE OF THE ENGLISH SIRDARS

412-126975-0038 EVERYTHING SEEMED UNDISTINGUISHED ABOUT THE PRIEST EVEN DOWN TO HIS NAME WHICH WAS BROWN YET THE COLONEL HAD ALWAYS FOUND SOMETHING COMPANIONABLE ABOUT HIM AND FREQUENTLY ASKED HIM TO SUCH FAMILY GATHERINGS
412-126975-0039 IN THE LARGE ENTRANCE HALL OF THE HOUSE THERE WAS AMPLE ROOM EVEN FOR SIR LEOPOLD AND THE REMOVAL OF HIS WRAPS PORCH AND VESTIBULE INDEED
412-126975-0040 WERE UNDULY LARGE IN PROPORTION TO THE HOUSE AND FORMED AS IT WERE A BIG ROOM WITH THE FRONT DOOR AT ONE END AND THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE AT THE OTHER IN FRONT OF THE LARGE HALL FIRE
412-126975-0041 OVER WHICH HUNG THE COLONEL'S SWORD THE PROCESS WAS COMPLETED AND THE COMPANY INCLUDING THE SATURNINE CROOK PRESENTED TO SIR LEOPOLD FISCHER THAT VENERABLE FINANCIER HOWEVER

412-126975-0043 WITH AN UNAFFECTED VAIN GLORY THAT HAD SOMETHING DISARMING ABOUT IT HE HELD OUT THE CASE BEFORE THEM ALL IT FLEW OPEN AT A TOUCH AND HALF BLINDED THEM
412-126975-0044 IT WAS JUST AS IF A CRYSTAL FOUNTAIN HAD SPURTED IN THEIR EYES IN A NEST OF ORANGE VELVET LAY LIKE THREE EGGS THREE WHITE AND VIVID DIAMONDS THAT SEEMED TO SET THE VERY AIR ON FIRE ALL ROUND THEM
412-126975-0045 FISCHER STOOD BEAMING BENEVOLENTLY AND DRINKING DEEP OF THE ASTONISHMENT AND ECSTASY OF THE GIRL THE GRIM ADMIRATION AND GRUFF THANKS OF THE COLONEL THE WONDER OF THE WHOLE GROUP

412-126975-0051 A RADICAL DOES NOT MEAN A MAN WHO LIVES ON RADISHES REMARKED CROOK WITH SOME IMPATIENCE AND A CONSERVATIVE DOES NOT MEAN A MAN WHO PRESERVES JAM NEITHER I ASSURE YOU
412-126975-0052 DOES A SOCIALIST MEAN A MAN WHO DESIRES A SOCIAL EVENING WITH THE CHIMNEY SWEEP A SOCIALIST MEANS A MAN WHO WANTS ALL THE CHIMNEYS SWEPT AND ALL THE CHIMNEY SWEEPS PAID FOR IT BUT WHO WON'T ALLOW YOU
412-126975-0053 PUT IN THE PRIEST IN A LOW VOICE TO OWN YOUR OWN SOOT CROOK LOOKED AT HIM WITH AN EYE OF INTEREST AND EVEN RESPECT DOES ONE WANT TO OWN SOOT HE ASKED ONE MIGHT

412-126975-0057 NOW GATHERING GLOOM AGAINST A GORGEOUS VIOLET SUNSET THE SCENE THUS FRAMED WAS SO COLOURED AND QUAINT LIKE A BACK SCENE IN A PLAY THAT THEY FORGOT A MOMENT THE INSIGNIFICANT FIGURE STANDING IN THE DOOR
412-126975-0058 HE WAS DUSTY LOOKING AND IN A FRAYED COAT EVIDENTLY A COMMON MESSENGER ANY OF YOU GENTLEMEN MISTER BLOUNT HE ASKED AND HELD FORWARD A LETTER DOUBTFULLY
412-126975-0059 MISTER BLOUNT STARTED AND STOPPED IN HIS SHOUT OF ASSENT RIPPING UP THE ENVELOPE WITH EVIDENT ASTONISHMENT HE READ IT HIS FACE CLOUDED A LITTLE AND THEN CLEARED AND HE TURNED TO HIS BROTHER IN LAW AND HOST
412-126975-0060 I'M SICK AT BEING SUCH A NUISANCE COLONEL HE SAID WITH THE CHEERY COLONIAL CONVENTIONS BUT WOULD IT UPSET YOU IF AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE CALLED ON ME HERE TONIGHT ON BUSINESS IN POINT OF FACT IT'S FLORIAN

412-126975-0065 DON'T LET'S QUARREL THERE ARE LOWER JOKES THAN SITTING ON A TOP HAT DISLIKE OF THE RED TIED YOUTH BORN OF HIS PREDATORY OPINIONS AND EVIDENT INTIMACY WITH THE PRETTY GODCHILD
412-126975-0066 LED FISCHER TO SAY IN HIS MOST SARCASTIC MAGISTERIAL MANNER NO DOUBT YOU HAVE FOUND SOMETHING MUCH LOWER THAN SITTING ON A TOP HAT WHAT IS IT PRAY
412-126975-0067 LETTING A TOP HAT SIT ON YOU FOR INSTANCE SAID THE SOCIALIST NOW NOW NOW CRIED THE CANADIAN FARMER WITH HIS BARBARIAN BENEVOLENCE DON'T LET'S SPOIL A JOLLY EVENING

4137-11701-0045 WAS IT FAIR TO DISAPPOINT ONE WHO HAD PERHAPS SOME LITTLE GROUNDS FOR AFTER ALL HE HAD BEEN NO MORE GALLANT THAN WAS CUSTOMARY FROM A PRINCE AND A GENTLEMAN TO A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IT WAS HER OWN FAULT IF SHE HAD MISTAKEN HIS INTENTIONS

4137-11702-0017 HERE HE TURNED AND EMBRACED HIS DAUGHTER AGAIN AND IF HIS EYE TRAVELLED OVER HER SHOULDER IN THE DIRECTION OF BELVANE'S GARDEN IT IS A SMALL MATTER AND ONE FOR WHICH THE ARCHITECT OF THE CASTLE NO DOUBT WAS PRINCIPALLY TO BLAME

4214-7146-0057 NOT EVEN IF THEY DRANK THREE BIG TUMBLERFULS AS DIANA DID OH IT SOUNDS SO SO LIKE MISSUS THOMAS'S HUSBAND BUT I DIDN'T MEAN TO SET HER DRUNK DRUNK FIDDLESTICKS SAID MARILLA MARCHING TO THE SITTING ROOM PANTRY
4214-7146-0058 ALTHOUGH CERTAIN OF THE STRICTER SORT MISSUS BARRY AMONG THEM DISAPPROVED STRONGLY OF IT AND AT THE SAME TIME MARILLA RECOLLECTED THAT SHE HAD PUT THE BOTTLE OF RASPBERRY CORDIAL DOWN IN THE CELLAR
4214-7146-0059 SHE WENT BACK TO THE KITCHEN WITH THE WINE BOTTLE IN HER HAND HER FACE WAS TWITCHING IN SPITE OF HERSELF ANNE YOU CERTAINLY HAVE A GENIUS FOR GETTING INTO TROUBLE YOU WENT AND GAVE DIANA CURRANT WINE INSTEAD OF RASPBERRY CORDIAL
4214-7146-0060 DIDN'T YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE YOURSELF I NEVER TASTED IT SAID ANNE I THOUGHT IT WAS THE CORDIAL I MEANT TO BE SO SO HOSPITABLE DIANA GOT AWFULLY SICK AND HAD TO GO HOME MISSUS BARRY TOLD MISSUS LYNDE SHE WAS SIMPLY DEAD DRUNK
4214-7146-0061 SHE JUST LAUGHED SILLY LIKE WHEN HER MOTHER ASKED HER WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND WENT TO SLEEP AND SLEPT FOR HOURS HER MOTHER SMELLED HER BREATH AND KNEW SHE WAS DRUNK SHE HAD A FEARFUL HEADACHE ALL DAY YESTERDAY MISSUS BARRY IS SO INDIGNANT
4214-7146-0062 SHE WILL NEVER BELIEVE BUT WHAT I DID IT ON PURPOSE I SHOULD THINK SHE WOULD BETTER PUNISH DIANA FOR BEING SO GREEDY AS TO DRINK THREE GLASSFULS OF ANYTHING SAID MARILLA SHORTLY WHY THREE OF THOSE BIG GLASSES WOULD HAVE MADE HER SICK EVEN IF IT HAD ONLY BEEN CORDIAL
4214-7146-0063 WELL THIS STORY WILL BE A NICE HANDLE FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE SO DOWN ON ME FOR MAKING CURRANT WINE ALTHOUGH I HAVEN'T MADE ANY FOR THREE YEARS EVER SINCE I FOUND OUT THAT THE MINISTER DIDN'T APPROVE I JUST KEPT THAT BOTTLE FOR SICKNESS
4214-7146-0064 THERE THERE CHILD DON'T CRY I CAN'T SEE AS YOU WERE TO BLAME ALTHOUGH I'M SORRY IT HAPPENED SO I MUST CRY SAID ANNE MY HEART IS BROKEN THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES FIGHT AGAINST ME MARILLA DIANA AND I ARE PARTED FOREVER OH MARILLA
4214-7146-0065 MISSUS BARRY WILL THINK BETTER OF IT WHEN SHE FINDS YOU'RE NOT TO BLAME I SUPPOSE SHE THINKS YOU'VE DONE IT FOR A SILLY JOKE OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT YOU'D BEST GO UP THIS EVENING AND TELL HER HOW IT WAS
4214-7146-0066 MY COURAGE FAILS ME AT THE THOUGHT OF FACING DIANA'S INJURED MOTHER SIGHED ANNE I WISH YOU'D GO MARILLA YOU'RE SO MUCH MORE DIGNIFIED THAN I AM LIKELY SHE'D LISTEN TO YOU QUICKER THAN TO ME WELL I WILL
4214-7146-0067 SAID MARILLA REFLECTING THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE THE WISER COURSE DON'T CRY ANY MORE ANNE IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT MARILLA HAD CHANGED HER MIND ABOUT IT BEING ALL RIGHT BY THE TIME SHE GOT BACK FROM ORCHARD SLOPE ANNE WAS WATCHING FOR HER COMING AND FLEW TO THE PORCH DOOR TO MEET HER
4214-7146-0068 OH MARILLA I KNOW BY YOUR FACE THAT IT'S BEEN NO USE SHE SAID SORROWFULLY MISSUS BARRY WON'T FORGIVE ME MISSUS BARRY INDEED SNAPPED MARILLA OF ALL THE UNREASONABLE WOMEN I EVER SAW SHE'S THE WORST
4214-7146-0069 MARILLA WHISKED INTO THE KITCHEN GRIEVOUSLY DISTURBED LEAVING A VERY MUCH DISTRACTED LITTLE SOUL IN THE PORCH BEHIND HER PRESENTLY ANNE STEPPED OUT BAREHEADED INTO THE CHILL AUTUMN DUSK
4214-7146-0070 VERY DETERMINEDLY AND STEADILY SHE TOOK HER WAY DOWN THROUGH THE SERE CLOVER FIELD OVER THE LOG BRIDGE AND UP THROUGH THE SPRUCE GROVE LIGHTED BY A PALE LITTLE MOON HANGING LOW OVER THE WESTERN WOODS
4214-7146-0071 MISSUS BARRY COMING TO THE DOOR IN ANSWER TO A TIMID KNOCK FOUND A WHITE LIPPED EAGER EYED SUPPLIANT ON THE DOORSTEP HER FACE HARDENED MISSUS BARRY WAS A WOMAN OF STRONG PREJUDICES AND DISLIKES AND HER ANGER WAS OF THE COLD SULLEN SORT WHICH IS ALWAYS HARDEST TO OVERCOME
4214-7146-0072 TO DO HER JUSTICE SHE REALLY BELIEVED ANNE HAD MADE DIANA DRUNK OUT OF SHEER MALICE PREPENSE AND SHE WAS HONESTLY ANXIOUS TO PRESERVE HER LITTLE DAUGHTER FROM THE CONTAMINATION OF FURTHER INTIMACY WITH SUCH A CHILD WHAT DO YOU WANT SHE SAID STIFFLY
4214-7146-0073 ANNE CLASPED HER HANDS OH MISSUS BARRY PLEASE FORGIVE ME I DID NOT MEAN TO TO INTOXICATE DIANA HOW COULD I JUST IMAGINE IF YOU WERE A POOR LITTLE ORPHAN GIRL THAT KIND PEOPLE HAD ADOPTED
4214-7146-0074 AND YOU HAD JUST ONE BOSOM FRIEND IN ALL THE WORLD DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD INTOXICATE HER ON PURPOSE I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY RASPBERRY CORDIAL I WAS FIRMLY CONVINCED IT WAS RASPBERRY CORDIAL OH PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT YOU WON'T LET DIANA PLAY WITH ME ANY MORE
4214-7146-0075 IF YOU DO YOU WILL COVER MY LIFE WITH A DARK CLOUD OF WOE THIS SPEECH WHICH WOULD HAVE SOFTENED GOOD MISSUS LYNDE'S HEART IN A TWINKLING HAD NO EFFECT ON MISSUS BARRY EXCEPT TO IRRITATE HER STILL MORE SHE WAS SUSPICIOUS OF ANNE'S BIG WORDS AND DRAMATIC GESTURES
4214-7146-0076 AND IMAGINED THAT THE CHILD WAS MAKING FUN OF HER SO SHE SAID COLDLY AND CRUELLY I DON'T THINK YOU ARE A FIT LITTLE GIRL FOR DIANA TO ASSOCIATE WITH YOU'D BETTER GO HOME AND BEHAVE YOURSELF ANNE'S LIPS QUIVERED
4214-7146-0077 WON'T YOU LET ME SEE DIANA JUST ONCE TO SAY FAREWELL SHE IMPLORED DIANA HAS GONE OVER TO CARMODY WITH HER FATHER SAID MISSUS BARRY GOING IN AND SHUTTING THE DOOR ANNE WENT BACK TO GREEN GABLES CALM WITH DESPAIR
4214-7146-0078 MY LAST HOPE IS GONE SHE TOLD MARILLA I WENT UP AND SAW MISSUS BARRY MYSELF AND SHE TREATED ME VERY INSULTINGLY MARILLA I DO NOT THINK SHE IS A WELL BRED WOMAN THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO DO EXCEPT TO PRAY
4214-7146-0079 ANNE YOU SHOULDN'T SAY SUCH THINGS REBUKED MARILLA STRIVING TO OVERCOME THAT UNHOLY TENDENCY TO LAUGHTER WHICH SHE WAS DISMAYED TO FIND GROWING UPON HER AND INDEED WHEN SHE TOLD THE WHOLE STORY TO MATTHEW THAT NIGHT SHE DID LAUGH HEARTILY OVER ANNE'S TRIBULATIONS
4214-7146-0080 BUT WHEN SHE SLIPPED INTO THE EAST GABLE BEFORE GOING TO BED AND FOUND THAT ANNE HAD CRIED HERSELF TO SLEEP AN UNACCUSTOMED SOFTNESS CREPT INTO HER FACE POOR LITTLE SOUL SHE MURMURED
426-122819-0000 THAT OLD NUISANCE OF A RACHEL LYNDE WAS HERE AGAIN TODAY PESTERING ME FOR A SUBSCRIPTION TOWARDS BUYING A CARPET FOR THE VESTRY ROOM SAID MISTER HARRISON WRATHFULLY I DETEST THAT WOMAN MORE THAN ANYBODY I KNOW SHE CAN PUT A WHOLE SERMON
426-122819-0001 TEXT COMMENT AND APPLICATION INTO SIX WORDS AND THROW IT AT YOU LIKE A BRICK ANNE WHO WAS PERCHED ON THE EDGE OF THE VERANDA ENJOYING THE CHARM OF A MILD WEST WIND BLOWING ACROSS A NEWLY PLOUGHED FIELD ON A GRAY NOVEMBER TWILIGHT
426-122819-0002 AND PIPING A QUAINT LITTLE MELODY AMONG THE TWISTED FIRS BELOW THE GARDEN TURNED HER DREAMY FACE OVER HER SHOULDER THE TROUBLE IS YOU AND MISSUS LYNDE DON'T UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER SHE EXPLAINED THAT IS ALWAYS WHAT IS WRONG WHEN PEOPLE DON'T LIKE EACH OTHER
426-122819-0003 I DIDN'T LIKE MISSUS LYNDE AT FIRST EITHER BUT AS SOON AS I CAME TO UNDERSTAND HER I LEARNED TO MISSUS LYNDE MAY BE AN ACQUIRED TASTE WITH SOME FOLKS
426-122819-0004 I SAID SOME DREADFUL THINGS TO MISSUS LYNDE LONG AGO BUT IT WAS WHEN I HAD LOST MY TEMPER I COULDN'T SAY THEM DELIBERATELY IT WAS THE TRUTH AND I BELIEVE IN TELLING THE TRUTH TO EVERYBODY
426-122819-0005 YOU ONLY TELL THE DISAGREEABLE PART OF THE TRUTH NOW YOU'VE TOLD ME A DOZEN TIMES THAT MY HAIR WAS RED BUT YOU'VE NEVER ONCE TOLD ME THAT I HAD A NICE NOSE
426-122819-0006 I KNOW I HAVE RED HAIR TOO ALTHOUGH IT'S MUCH DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE SO THERE'S NO NEED OF TELLING ME THAT EITHER WELL WELL I'LL TRY AND NOT MENTION IT AGAIN SINCE YOU'RE SO SENSITIVE
426-122819-0007 YOU MUST EXCUSE ME ANNE I'VE GOT A HABIT OF BEING OUTSPOKEN AND FOLKS MUSTN'T MIND IT BUT THEY CAN'T HELP MINDING IT AND I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY HELP THAT IT'S YOUR HABIT WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF A PERSON WHO WENT ABOUT STICKING PINS AND NEEDLES INTO PEOPLE AND SAYING
426-122819-0008 EXCUSE ME YOU MUSTN'T MIND IT IT'S JUST A HABIT I'VE GOT YOU'D THINK HE WAS CRAZY WOULDN'T YOU AND AS FOR MISSUS LYNDE BEING A BUSYBODY PERHAPS SHE IS BUT DID YOU TELL HER SHE HAD A VERY KIND HEART AND ALWAYS HELPED THE POOR
426-122819-0009 AND NEVER SAID A WORD WHEN TIMOTHY COTTON STOLE A CROCK OF BUTTER OUT OF HER DAIRY AND TOLD HIS WIFE HE'D BOUGHT IT FROM HER MISSUS COTTON CAST IT UP TO HER THE NEXT TIME THEY MET THAT IT TASTED OF TURNIPS AND MISSUS LYNDE JUST SAID SHE WAS SORRY IT HAD TURNED OUT SO POORLY
426-122819-0010 FOLKS ARE EVERLASTING BEGGING FOR MONEY HERE IT SEEMS TO ME HOW'S YOUR PROJECT OF PAINTING THE HALL COMING ON SPLENDIDLY WE HAD A MEETING OF THE A V I S LAST FRIDAY NIGHT AND FOUND THAT WE HAD PLENTY OF MONEY SUBSCRIBED TO PAINT THE HALL AND SHINGLE THE ROOF TOO
426-122819-0011 MOST PEOPLE GAVE VERY LIBERALLY MISTER HARRISON ANNE WAS A SWEET SOULED LASS BUT SHE COULD INSTILL SOME VENOM INTO INNOCENT ITALICS WHEN OCCASION REQUIRED WHAT COLOR ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE IT WE HAVE DECIDED ON A VERY PRETTY GREEN
426-122819-0012 MISTER ROGER PYE IS GOING TO GET THE PAINT IN TOWN TODAY WHO'S GOT THE JOB MISTER JOSHUA PYE OF CARMODY HE HAS NEARLY FINISHED THE SHINGLING WE HAD TO GIVE HIM THE CONTRACT FOR EVERY ONE OF THE PYES AND THERE ARE FOUR FAMILIES YOU KNOW
426-122819-0013 SAID THEY WOULDN'T GIVE A CENT UNLESS JOSHUA GOT IT THEY HAD SUBSCRIBED TWELVE DOLLARS BETWEEN THEM AND WE THOUGHT THAT WAS TOO MUCH TO LOSE ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE THINK WE SHOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN IN TO THE PYES MISSUS LYNDE SAYS THEY TRY TO RUN EVERYTHING
426-122819-0014 THE MAIN QUESTION IS WILL THIS JOSHUA DO HIS WORK WELL IF HE DOES I DON'T SEE THAT IT MATTERS WHETHER HIS NAME IS PYE OR PUDDING HE HAS THE REPUTATION OF BEING A GOOD WORKMAN THOUGH THEY SAY HE'S A VERY PECULIAR MAN HE HARDLY EVER TALKS
426-122819-0015 HE'S PECULIAR ENOUGH ALL RIGHT THEN SAID MISTER HARRISON DRILY
426-122819-0016 I NEVER WAS MUCH OF A TALKER TILL I CAME TO AVONLEA AND THEN I HAD TO BEGIN IN SELF DEFENSE OR MISSUS LYNDE WOULD HAVE SAID I WAS DUMB AND STARTED A SUBSCRIPTION TO HAVE ME TAUGHT SIGN LANGUAGE
426-122819-0017 I MUST I HAVE SOME SEWING TO DO FOR DORA THIS EVENING BESIDES DAVY IS PROBABLY BREAKING MARILLA'S HEART WITH SOME NEW MISCHIEF BY THIS TIME THIS MORNING THE FIRST THING HE SAID WAS WHERE DOES THE DARK GO ANNE I WANT TO KNOW
426-122819-0018 THE POOR BIRD HAS BEEN MOPING EVER SINCE THOSE CHILDREN MUST BE A SIGHT OF TROUBLE TO YOU FOLKS EVERYTHING THAT'S WORTH HAVING IS SOME TROUBLE SAID ANNE SECRETLY RESOLVING TO FORGIVE DAVY'S NEXT OFFENCE WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE SINCE HE HAD AVENGED HER ON GINGER
426-122819-0019 BEGAN PAINTING THE NEXT DAY HE WAS NOT DISTURBED IN HIS TASK THE HALL WAS SITUATED ON WHAT WAS CALLED THE LOWER ROAD IN LATE AUTUMN THIS ROAD WAS ALWAYS MUDDY AND WET AND PEOPLE GOING TO CARMODY TRAVELED BY THE LONGER UPPER ROAD
426-122819-0020 THE HALL WAS SO CLOSELY SURROUNDED BY FIR WOODS THAT IT WAS INVISIBLE UNLESS YOU WERE NEAR IT MISTER JOSHUA PYE PAINTED AWAY IN THE SOLITUDE AND INDEPENDENCE THAT WERE SO DEAR TO HIS UNSOCIABLE HEART FRIDAY AFTERNOON HE FINISHED HIS JOB AND WENT HOME TO CARMODY
426-122819-0021 THE NEWS FLEW LIKE WILDFIRE GILBERT BLYTHE PORING OVER A TEXT BOOK AT HOME HEARD IT FROM HIS FATHER'S HIRED BOY AT SUNSET AND RUSHED BREATHLESSLY TO GREEN GABLES JOINED ON THE WAY BY FRED WRIGHT
426-122819-0022 ARRIVING AT THIS MOMENT WITH A BANDBOX HE HAD BROUGHT FROM TOWN FOR MARILLA HAVEN'T YOU HEARD SAID JANE WRATHFULLY WELL ITS SIMPLY THIS JOSHUA PYE HAS GONE AND PAINTED THE HALL BLUE INSTEAD OF GREEN A DEEP BRILLIANT BLUE
426-122819-0023 THE SHADE THEY USE FOR PAINTING CARTS AND WHEELBARROWS AND MISSUS LYNDE SAYS IT IS THE MOST HIDEOUS COLOR FOR A BUILDING ESPECIALLY WHEN COMBINED WITH A RED ROOF THAT SHE EVER SAW OR IMAGINED YOU COULD SIMPLY HAVE KNOCKED ME DOWN WITH A FEATHER WHEN I HEARD IT
426-122819-0024 IT'S HEARTBREAKING AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE WE'VE HAD HOW ON EARTH COULD SUCH A MISTAKE HAVE HAPPENED WAILED DIANA THE BLAME OF THIS UNMERCIFUL DISASTER WAS EVENTUALLY NARROWED DOWN TO THE PYES THE IMPROVERS HAD DECIDED TO USE MORTON HARRIS PAINTS
426-122819-0025 AND THE MORTON HARRIS PAINT CANS WERE NUMBERED ACCORDING TO A COLOR CARD A PURCHASER CHOSE HIS SHADE ON THE CARD AND ORDERED BY THE ACCOMPANYING NUMBER
426-122819-0026 AND WHEN MISTER ROGER PYE SENT WORD TO THE IMPROVERS BY HIS SON JOHN ANDREW THAT HE WAS GOING TO TOWN AND WOULD GET THEIR PAINT FOR THEM
426-122819-0027 AND THERE THE MATTER STANDS TO THIS DAY THAT NIGHT THERE WAS BLANK DISMAY IN EVERY AVONLEA HOUSE WHERE AN IMPROVER LIVED THE GLOOM AT GREEN GABLES WAS SO INTENSE THAT IT QUENCHED EVEN DAVY ANNE WEPT AND WOULD NOT BE COMFORTED
426-122819-0028 AND IT SOUNDS THE DEATH KNELL OF OUR SOCIETY WE'LL SIMPLY BE LAUGHED OUT OF EXISTENCE IN LIFE AS IN DREAMS HOWEVER THINGS OFTEN GO BY CONTRARIES THE AVONLEA PEOPLE DID NOT LAUGH THEY WERE TOO ANGRY
426-122819-0029 THEIR MONEY HAD GONE TO PAINT THE HALL AND CONSEQUENTLY THEY FELT THEMSELVES BITTERLY AGGRIEVED BY THE MISTAKE PUBLIC INDIGNATION CENTERED ON THE PYES ROGER PYE AND JOHN ANDREW HAD BUNGLED THE MATTER BETWEEN THEM
426-122819-0030 AND AS FOR JOSHUA PYE HE MUST BE A BORN FOOL NOT TO SUSPECT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WHEN HE OPENED THE CANS AND SAW THE COLOR OF THE PAINT JOSHUA PYE WHEN THUS ANIMADVERTED UPON RETORTED THAT THE AVONLEA TASTE IN COLORS WAS NO BUSINESS OF HIS
426-122819-0031 YOU CAN'T HOLD HIM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MISTAKE SINCE HE CLAIMS HE WAS NEVER TOLD WHAT THE COLOR WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BUT JUST GIVEN THE CANS AND TOLD TO GO AHEAD BUT IT'S A BURNING SHAME AND THAT HALL CERTAINLY DOES LOOK AWFUL
426-122819-0032 THE LUCKLESS IMPROVERS EXPECTED THAT AVONLEA WOULD BE MORE PREJUDICED THAN EVER AGAINST THEM BUT INSTEAD PUBLIC SYMPATHY VEERED AROUND IN THEIR FAVOR
426-122819-0033 HAD BEEN BADLY USED MISSUS LYNDE TOLD THEM TO KEEP ON AND SHOW THE PYES THAT THERE REALLY WERE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO COULD DO THINGS WITHOUT MAKING A MUDDLE OF THEM MISTER MAJOR SPENCER SENT THEM WORD THAT HE WOULD CLEAN OUT ALL THE STUMPS ALONG THE ROAD FRONT OF HIS FARM AND SEED IT DOWN WITH GRASS AT HIS OWN EXPENSE
426-122819-0034 TO TELL HER THAT IF THE SASSIETY WANTED TO MAKE A GERANIUM BED AT THE CROSSROADS IN THE SPRING THEY NEEDN'T BE AFRAID OF HER COW FOR SHE WOULD SEE THAT THE MARAUDING ANIMAL WAS KEPT WITHIN SAFE BOUNDS EVEN MISTER HARRISON CHUCKLED IF HE CHUCKLED AT ALL IN PRIVATE
426-122819-0035 AND WAS ALL SYMPATHY OUTWARDLY NEVER MIND ANNE MOST PAINTS FADE UGLIER EVERY YEAR BUT THAT BLUE IS AS UGLY AS IT CAN BE TO BEGIN WITH SO IT'S BOUND TO FADE PRETTIER AND THE ROOF IS SHINGLED AND PAINTED ALL RIGHT
426-122819-0036 FOLKS WILL BE ABLE TO SIT IN THE HALL AFTER THIS WITHOUT BEING LEAKED ON YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH ANYHOW
426-122821-0000 TEACHING IS REALLY VERY INTERESTING WORK WROTE ANNE TO A QUEEN'S ACADEMY CHUM JANE SAYS SHE THINKS IT IS MONOTONOUS BUT I DON'T FIND IT SO SOMETHING FUNNY IS ALMOST SURE TO HAPPEN EVERY DAY AND THE CHILDREN SAY SUCH AMUSING THINGS
426-122821-0001 IT WAS BECAUSE JIMMY CALLED HIM SAINT CLAIR THAT SAINT CLAIR POUNDED HIM ON THE WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL I HEARD OF THE POUNDING BUT NOT OFFICIALLY SO I DON'T THINK I'LL TAKE ANY NOTICE OF IT YESTERDAY I WAS TRYING TO TEACH LOTTIE WRIGHT TO DO ADDITION I SAID
426-122821-0002 BECAUSE IT WOULD RAIN THE NEXT DAY IT'S SO HARD NOT TO LAUGH STELLA I HAVE TO SAVE UP ALL MY AMUSEMENT UNTIL I GET HOME AND MARILLA SAYS IT MAKES HER NERVOUS TO HEAR WILD SHRIEKS OF MIRTH PROCEEDING FROM THE EAST GABLE WITHOUT ANY APPARENT CAUSE
426-122821-0003 DID YOU KNOW THAT THOMAS A BECKET WAS CANONIZED AS A SNAKE ROSE BELL SAYS HE WAS ALSO THAT WILLIAM TYNDALE WROTE THE NEW TESTAMENT CLAUDE WHITE SAYS A GLACIER IS A MAN WHO PUTS IN WINDOW FRAMES

426-122821-0005 BUT IF YOU WERE A WIDOW THERE'D BE NO DANGER OF EITHER THE MOST REMARKABLE WISH WAS SALLY BELL'S SHE WANTED A HONEYMOON
426-122821-0006 BECAUSE HER COUSIN IN MONTREAL WENT ON A HONEYMOON WHEN HE WAS MARRIED AND HE HAD ALWAYS HAD THE VERY LATEST IN BICYCLES ANOTHER DAY I ASKED THEM ALL TO TELL ME THE NAUGHTIEST THING THEY HAD EVER DONE I COULDN'T GET THE OLDER ONES TO DO SO BUT THE THIRD CLASS ANSWERED QUITE FREELY

426-122822-0003 AND WHEN BARBARA SHAW CAME UP TO THE DESK WITH A SUM SHE TRIPPED OVER THE COAL SCUTTLE WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS THE COAL ROLLED TO EVERY PART OF THE ROOM HER SLATE WAS BROKEN INTO FRAGMENTS AND WHEN SHE PICKED HERSELF UP HER FACE STAINED WITH COAL DUST SENT THE BOYS INTO ROARS OF LAUGHTER
426-122822-0004 ANNE TURNED FROM THE SECOND READER CLASS WHICH SHE WAS HEARING REALLY BARBARA SHE SAID ICILY IF YOU CANNOT MOVE WITHOUT FALLING OVER SOMETHING YOU'D BETTER REMAIN IN YOUR SEAT IT IS POSITIVELY DISGRACEFUL FOR A GIRL OF YOUR AGE TO BE SO AWKWARD
426-122822-0005 PLEASE MISS I HAD TO HELP MA MAKE A PUDDING FOR DINNER CAUSE WE'RE EXPECTING COMPANY AND CLARICE ALMIRA'S SICK WAS SAINT CLAIR'S ANSWER GIVEN IN A PERFECTLY RESPECTFUL VOICE BUT NEVERTHELESS PROVOCATIVE OF GREAT MIRTH AMONG HIS MATES
426-122822-0006 TAKE YOUR SEAT AND WORK OUT THE SIX PROBLEMS ON PAGE EIGHTY FOUR OF YOUR ARITHMETIC FOR PUNISHMENT SAID ANNE SAINT CLAIR LOOKED RATHER AMAZED AT HER TONE BUT HE WENT MEEKLY TO HIS DESK AND TOOK OUT HIS SLATE THEN HE STEALTHILY PASSED A SMALL PARCEL TO JOE SLOANE ACROSS THE AISLE
426-122822-0007 ANNE CAUGHT HIM IN THE ACT AND JUMPED TO A FATAL CONCLUSION ABOUT THAT PARCEL OLD MISSUS HIRAM SLOANE HAD LATELY TAKEN TO MAKING AND SELLING NUT CAKES BY WAY OF ADDING TO HER SCANTY INCOME THE CAKES WERE SPECIALLY TEMPTING TO SMALL BOYS
426-122822-0008 ANNE HAD WARNED THEM THAT IF THEY BROUGHT ANY MORE CAKES TO SCHOOL THEY WOULD BE CONFISCATED AND YET HERE WAS SAINT CLAIR DONNELL COOLLY PASSING A PARCEL OF THEM WRAPPED UP IN THE BLUE AND WHITE STRIPED PAPER MISSUS HIRAM USED UNDER HER VERY EYES
426-122822-0009 REALLY HELD AN ASSORTMENT OF FIRECRACKERS AND PINWHEELS FOR WHICH WARREN SLOANE HAD SENT TO TOWN BY SAINT CLAIR DONNELL'S FATHER THE DAY BEFORE INTENDING TO HAVE A BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION THAT EVENING
426-122822-0010 JOE SLOANE STOOD AS ONE TRANSFIXED IN THE MIDST OF THE COMMOTION AND SAINT CLAIR HELPLESS WITH LAUGHTER ROCKED TO AND FRO IN THE AISLE PRILLIE ROGERSON FAINTED AND ANNETTA BELL WENT INTO HYSTERICS
426-122822-0011 ANNE RECOVERING HERSELF SPRANG TO OPEN DOORS AND WINDOWS AND LET OUT THE GAS AND SMOKE WHICH FILLED THE ROOM THEN SHE HELPED THE GIRLS CARRY THE UNCONSCIOUS PRILLIE INTO THE PORCH
426-122822-0012 WHERE BARBARA SHAW IN AN AGONY OF DESIRE TO BE USEFUL POURED A PAILFUL OF HALF FROZEN WATER OVER PRILLIE'S FACE AND SHOULDERS BEFORE ANYONE COULD STOP HER IT WAS A FULL HOUR BEFORE QUIET WAS RESTORED
426-122822-0013 EVERYBODY REALIZED THAT EVEN THE EXPLOSION HAD NOT CLEARED THE TEACHER'S MENTAL ATMOSPHERE NOBODY EXCEPT ANTHONY PYE DARED WHISPER A WORD NED CLAY ACCIDENTALLY SQUEAKED HIS PENCIL WHILE WORKING A SUM CAUGHT ANNE'S EYE AND WISHED THE FLOOR WOULD OPEN AND SWALLOW HIM UP
426-122822-0014 CHESTER SLOANE SPELLING ODORIFEROUS WITH TWO F'S WAS MADE TO FEEL THAT HE COULD NEVER LIVE DOWN THE DISGRACE OF IT EITHER IN THIS WORLD OR THAT WHICH IS TO COME
426-122822-0015 BUT THE KNOWLEDGE ONLY ANGERED HER FURTHER
426-122822-0016 HE PEERED ACROSS HIS BOOK AT ANNE HIS BLACK EYES SPARKLING WITH CURIOSITY AND MOCKERY ANNE TWITCHED OPEN THE DRAWER OF HER DESK IN SEARCH OF CHALK AND UNDER HER VERY HAND A LIVELY MOUSE SPRANG OUT OF THE DRAWER SCAMPERED OVER THE DESK AND LEAPED TO THE FLOOR
426-122822-0017 ESPECIALLY AS SHE DIDN'T KNOW JUST WHERE THE MOUSE HAD GONE BUT SHE DECIDED NOT TO WHO COULD TAKE ANY COMFORT OUT OF HYSTERICS WITH A TEACHER SO WHITE FACED AND SO BLAZING EYED STANDING BEFORE ONE WHO PUT THAT MOUSE IN MY DESK SAID ANNE
426-122822-0018 HER VOICE WAS QUITE LOW BUT IT MADE A SHIVER GO UP AND DOWN PAUL IRVING'S SPINE JOE SLOANE CAUGHT HER EYE FELT RESPONSIBLE FROM THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD TO THE SOLE OF HIS FEET BUT STUTTERED OUT WILDLY
426-122822-0019 ANNE PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE WRETCHED JOSEPH SHE LOOKED AT ANTHONY PYE AND ANTHONY PYE LOOKED BACK UNABASHED AND UNASHAMED ANTHONY WAS IT YOU YES IT WAS SAID ANTHONY INSOLENTLY
426-122822-0020 ANNE TOOK HER POINTER FROM HER DESK IT WAS A LONG HEAVY HARDWOOD POINTER COME HERE ANTHONY IT WAS FAR FROM BEING THE MOST SEVERE PUNISHMENT ANTHONY PYE HAD EVER UNDERGONE ANNE
426-122822-0021 EVEN THE STORMY SOULED ANNE SHE WAS AT THAT MOMENT COULD NOT HAVE PUNISHED ANY CHILD CRUELLY BUT THE POINTER NIPPED KEENLY AND FINALLY ANTHONY'S BRAVADO FAILED HIM HE WINCED AND THE TEARS CAME TO HIS EYES ANNE CONSCIENCE STRICKEN DROPPED THE POINTER AND TOLD ANTHONY TO GO TO HIS SEAT
426-122822-0022 SHE SAT DOWN AT HER DESK FEELING ASHAMED REPENTANT AND BITTERLY MORTIFIED HER QUICK ANGER WAS GONE AND SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEEK RELIEF IN TEARS SO ALL HER BOASTS HAD COME TO THIS SHE HAD ACTUALLY WHIPPED ONE OF HER PUPILS
426-122822-0023 KEPT BACK HER TEARS UNTIL SHE GOT HOME THAT NIGHT THEN SHE SHUT HERSELF IN THE EAST GABLE ROOM AND WEPT ALL HER SHAME AND REMORSE AND DISAPPOINTMENT INTO HER PILLOWS WEPT SO LONG THAT MARILLA GREW ALARMED INVADED THE ROOM AND INSISTED ON KNOWING WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS
426-122822-0024 THE TROUBLE IS I'VE GOT THINGS THE MATTER WITH MY CONSCIENCE SOBBED ANNE OH THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A JONAH DAY MARILLA I'M SO ASHAMED OF MYSELF I LOST MY TEMPER AND WHIPPED ANTHONY PYE I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT SAID MARILLA WITH DECISION
426-122822-0025 IT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO OH NO NO MARILLA AND I DON'T SEE HOW I CAN EVER LOOK THOSE CHILDREN IN THE FACE AGAIN I FEEL THAT I HAVE HUMILIATED MYSELF TO THE VERY DUST YOU DON'T KNOW HOW CROSS AND HATEFUL AND HORRID I WAS
426-122822-0026 OH MARILLA I HAVE TRIED SO HARD TO BE PATIENT AND TO WIN ANTHONY'S LIKING AND NOW IT HAS ALL GONE FOR NOTHING MARILLA PASSED HER HARD WORK WORN HAND OVER THE GIRL'S GLOSSY TUMBLED HAIR WITH A WONDERFUL TENDERNESS
426-122822-0027 WHEN ANNE'S SOBS GREW QUIETER SHE SAID VERY GENTLY FOR HER YOU TAKE THINGS TOO MUCH TO HEART ANNE WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES BUT PEOPLE FORGET THEM AND JONAH DAYS COME TO EVERYBODY AS FOR ANTHONY PYE WHY NEED YOU CARE IF HE DOES DISLIKE YOU
426-122822-0028 HE IS THE ONLY ONE I CAN'T HELP IT I WANT EVERYBODY TO LOVE ME AND IT HURTS ME SO WHEN ANYBODY DOESN'T AND ANTHONY NEVER WILL NOW OH I JUST MADE AN IDIOT OF MYSELF TODAY MARILLA I'LL TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY
426-122822-0029 JUST COME DOWNSTAIRS AND HAVE YOUR SUPPER YOU'LL SEE IF A GOOD CUP OF TEA AND THOSE PLUM PUFFS I MADE TODAY WON'T HEARTEN YOU UP PLUM PUFFS WON'T MINISTER TO A MIND DISEASED SAID ANNE DISCONSOLATELY
426-122822-0030 IT HAD SNOWED SOFTLY AND THICKLY ALL THROUGH THE HOURS OF DARKNESS AND THE BEAUTIFUL WHITENESS GLITTERING IN THE FROSTY SUNSHINE LOOKED LIKE A MANTLE OF CHARITY CAST OVER ALL THE MISTAKES AND HUMILIATIONS OF THE PAST EVERY MORN IS A FRESH BEGINNING
426-122822-0031 EVERY MORN IS THE WORLD MADE NEW SANG ANNE AS SHE DRESSED OWING TO THE SNOW SHE HAD TO GO AROUND BY THE ROAD TO SCHOOL AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS CERTAINLY AN IMPISH COINCIDENCE THAT ANTHONY PYE SHOULD COME PLOUGHING ALONG JUST AS SHE LEFT THE GREEN GABLES LANE
426-122822-0032 ANNE SURRENDERED HER BOOKS AND WONDERED IF SHE COULD POSSIBLY BE AWAKE ANTHONY WALKED ON IN SILENCE TO THE SCHOOL BUT WHEN ANNE TOOK HER BOOKS SHE SMILED DOWN AT HIM NOT THE STEREOTYPED KIND SMILE SHE HAD SO PERSISTENTLY ASSUMED FOR HIS BENEFIT
426-122822-0033 BUT A SUDDEN OUTFLASHING OF GOOD COMRADESHIP ANTHONY SMILED NO IF THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD ANTHONY GRINNED BACK A GRIN IS NOT GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A RESPECTFUL THING
426-122822-0034 MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE CAME UP THE NEXT SATURDAY AND CONFIRMED THIS WELL ANNE I GUESS YOU'VE WON OVER ANTHONY PYE THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS HE BELIEVES YOU ARE SOME GOOD AFTER ALL EVEN IF YOU ARE A GIRL SAYS THAT WHIPPING YOU GAVE HIM WAS JUST AS GOOD AS A MAN'S
426-122822-0035 NO BUT THE PYES ARE AN EXCEPTION TO EVERY KNOWN RULE THAT'S WHAT DECLARED MISSUS RACHEL WITH CONVICTION
4297-13006-0000 NEITHER AT DINNER ON THAT EVENING AT MANCHESTER SQUARE NOR AFTER DINNER AS LONG AS MISSUS ROBY REMAINED IN THE HOUSE WAS A WORD SAID ABOUT LOPEZ BY MISTER WHARTON HE REMAINED LONGER THAN USUAL WITH HIS BOTTLE OF PORT WINE IN THE DINING ROOM
4297-13006-0001 BUT AS SOON AS MISSUS ROBY WAS GONE AND MISSUS ROBY WENT HOME ROUND THE CORNER SOMEWHAT EARLIER THAN USUAL THEN MISTER WHARTON WOKE UP INSTANTLY AND MADE INQUIRY OF HIS DAUGHTER
4297-13006-0002 THERE HAD HOWEVER BEEN A FEW WORDS SPOKEN ON THE SUBJECT BETWEEN MISSUS ROBY AND HER NIECE WHICH HAD SERVED TO PREPARE EMILY FOR WHAT WAS COMING LOPEZ HAS BEEN TO YOUR FATHER
4297-13006-0003 IF HE DID NOT MEAN YOU TO CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF WHY DIDN'T HE KEEP A CLOSER LOOK OUT I HAVEN'T CHOSEN ANY ONE AUNT HARRIET WELL TO SPEAK FAIRLY I THOUGHT YOU HAD AND I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY AGAINST YOUR CHOICE
4297-13006-0004 NO DOUBT YOUR PAPA WILL HAVE IT OUT WITH YOU JUST NOW SO YOU HAD BETTER MAKE UP YOUR MIND WHAT YOU WILL SAY TO HIM IF YOU REALLY LIKE THE MAN I DON'T SEE WHY YOU SHOULDN'T SAY SO AND STICK TO IT HE HAS MADE A REGULAR OFFER AND GIRLS IN THESE DAYS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE THEIR FATHER'S SLAVES
4297-13006-0005 MISSUS ROBY WAS PLEASED WITH LITTLE INTRIGUES WAS ADDICTED TO THE AMUSEMENT OF FOSTERING LOVE AFFAIRS WAS FOND OF BEING THOUGHT TO BE USEFUL IN SUCH MATTERS AND WAS NOT AVERSE TO HAVING PRESENTS GIVEN TO HER SHE HAD MARRIED A VULGAR MAN
4297-13006-0006 AND THOUGH SHE HAD NOT BECOME LIKE THE MAN SHE HAD BECOME VULGAR SHE WAS NOT AN ELIGIBLE COMPANION FOR MISTER WHARTON'S DAUGHTER A MATTER AS TO WHICH THE FATHER HAD NOT GIVEN HIMSELF PROPER OPPORTUNITIES OF LEARNING THE FACTS AN AUNT IN HIS CLOSE NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS SO GREAT A COMFORT TO HIM
4297-13006-0007 SO READY AND SO NATURAL AN ASSISTANCE TO HIM IN HIS DIFFICULTIES BUT EMILY WHARTON WAS NOT IN THE LEAST LIKE HER AUNT NOR HAD MISSUS WHARTON BEEN AT ALL LIKE MISSUS ROBY NO DOUBT THE CONTACT WAS DANGEROUS
4297-13006-0008 INJURY HAD PERHAPS ALREADY BEEN DONE IT MAY BE THAT SOME SLIGHTEST SOIL HAD ALREADY MARRED THE PURE WHITE OF THE GIRL'S NATURAL CHARACTER BUT IF SO THE STAIN WAS AS YET TOO IMPALPABLE TO BE VISIBLE TO ORDINARY EYES
4297-13006-0009 RATHER EXCEEDING THE AVERAGE PROPORTIONS AS WELL AS HEIGHT OF WOMEN HER FEATURES WERE REGULAR AND HANDSOME AND HER FORM WAS PERFECT BUT IT WAS BY HER MANNER AND HER VOICE THAT SHE CONQUERED RATHER THAN BY HER BEAUTY
4297-13006-0010 WHICH STRANGERS DID NOT FIND ON HER FACE BUT AS WE DO NOT LIGHT UP OUR HOUSES WITH OUR BRIGHTEST LAMPS FOR ALL COMERS SO NEITHER DID SHE EMIT FROM HER EYES THEIR BRIGHTEST SPARKS TILL SPECIAL OCCASION FOR SUCH SHINING HAD ARISEN
4297-13006-0011 TO THOSE WHO WERE ALLOWED TO LOVE HER NO WOMAN WAS MORE LOVABLE THERE WAS INNATE IN HER AN APPRECIATION OF HER OWN POSITION AS A WOMAN AND WITH IT A PRINCIPLE OF SELF DENIAL AS A HUMAN BEING WHICH IT WAS BEYOND THE POWER OF ANY MISSUS ROBY TO DESTROY
4297-13006-0012 THE YOUNG MAN MAY BECOME LORD CHANCELLOR OR AT ANY RATE EARN HIS BREAD COMFORTABLY AS A COUNTY COURT JUDGE BUT THE GIRL CAN LOOK FORWARD TO LITTLE ELSE THAN THE CHANCE OF HAVING A GOOD MAN FOR HER HUSBAND A GOOD MAN
4297-13006-0013 OR IF HER TASTES LIE IN THAT DIRECTION A RICH MAN EMILY WHARTON HAD DOUBTLESS THOUGHT ABOUT THESE THINGS AND SHE SINCERELY BELIEVED THAT SHE HAD FOUND THE GOOD MAN IN FERDINAND LOPEZ
4297-13006-0014 WHEN GOING TO MISTER WHARTON AT HIS CHAMBERS HE HAD NOT INTENDED TO CHEAT THE LAWYER INTO ANY ERRONEOUS IDEA ABOUT HIS FAMILY
4297-13006-0015 AND MISTER WHARTON HAD FELT HIMSELF BOUND TO ABSTAIN FROM ALLUSION TO SUCH MATTERS FROM AN ASSURED FEELING THAT HE COULD NOT IN THAT DIRECTION PLANT AN ENDURING OBJECTION IN THIS WAY LOPEZ HAD CARRIED HIS POINT WITH MISTER WHARTON
4297-13006-0016 AND THIS HE HAD DONE WITHOUT EVER HAVING ASKED FOR HER LOVE AND HE HAD EVEN TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO ALLURE DICK AND HAD LISTENED TO AND HAD TALKED WHOLE PAGES OUT OF BELL'S LIFE ON HIS OWN BEHALF IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED
4297-13006-0017 THAT HE DID LOVE THE GIRL AS WELL PERHAPS AS HE WAS CAPABLE OF LOVING ANY ONE BUT HE HAD FOUND OUT MANY PARTICULARS AS TO MISTER WHARTON'S MONEY BEFORE HE HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TO LOVE HER AS SOON AS MISSUS ROBY HAD GATHERED UP HER KNITTING
4297-13006-0018 AND DECLARED AS SHE ALWAYS DID ON SUCH OCCASIONS THAT SHE COULD GO ROUND THE CORNER WITHOUT HAVING ANY ONE TO LOOK AFTER HER
4297-13006-0019 HE CAME TO ME TO DAY AND ASKED FOR MY PERMISSION TO ADDRESS YOU SHE SAT PERFECTLY QUIET STILL LOOKING AT HIM BUT SHE DID NOT SAY A WORD OF COURSE I DID NOT GIVE HIM PERMISSION WHY OF COURSE PAPA
4297-13006-0020 BECAUSE HE IS A STRANGER AND A FOREIGNER WOULD YOU HAVE WISHED ME TO TELL HIM THAT HE MIGHT COME YES PAPA HE WAS SITTING ON A SOFA AND SHRANK BACK A LITTLE FROM HER AS SHE MADE THIS FREE AVOWAL
4297-13006-0021 IN THAT CASE I COULD HAVE JUDGED FOR MYSELF I SUPPOSE EVERY GIRL WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT BUT SHOULD YOU HAVE ACCEPTED HIM I THINK I SHOULD HAVE CONSULTED YOU BEFORE I DID THAT BUT I SHOULD HAVE WISHED TO ACCEPT HIM PAPA I DO LOVE HIM
4297-13006-0022 I HAVE NEVER SAID SO BEFORE TO ANY ONE I WOULD NOT SAY SO TO YOU NOW IF HE HAD NOT SPOKEN TO YOU AS HE HAS DONE EMILY IT MUST NOT BE WHY NOT PAPA IF YOU SAY IT SHALL NOT BE SO IT SHALL NOT
4297-13006-0023 I WILL DO AS YOU BID ME THEN HE PUT OUT HIS HAND AND CARESSED HER STROKING DOWN HER HAIR BUT I THINK YOU OUGHT TO TELL ME WHY IT MUST NOT BE
4297-13006-0024 HE IS A FOREIGNER BUT IS HE AND WHY SHOULD NOT A FOREIGNER BE AS GOOD AS AN ENGLISHMAN HIS NAME IS FOREIGN BUT HE TALKS ENGLISH AND LIVES AS AN ENGLISHMAN HE HAS NO RELATIVES NO FAMILY NO BELONGINGS
4297-13006-0025 HE IS WHAT WE CALL AN ADVENTURER MARRIAGE MY DEAR IS A MOST SERIOUS THING YES PAPA I KNOW THAT ONE IS BOUND TO BE VERY CAREFUL HOW CAN I GIVE YOU TO A MAN I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT AN ADVENTURER
4297-13006-0026 WHAT WOULD THEY SAY IN HEREFORDSHIRE I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY SHOULD SAY ANYTHING BUT IF THEY DID I SHOULDN'T MUCH CARE I SHOULD MY DEAR I SHOULD CARE VERY MUCH ONE IS BOUND TO THINK OF ONE'S FAMILY SUPPOSE IT SHOULD TURN OUT AFTERWARDS THAT HE WAS
4297-13006-0027 DISREPUTABLE YOU MAY SAY THAT OF ANY MAN PAPA BUT WHEN A MAN HAS CONNEXIONS A FATHER AND MOTHER OR UNCLES AND AUNTS PEOPLE THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT THEN THERE IS SOME GUARANTEE OF SECURITY
4297-13006-0028 DID YOU EVER HEAR THIS MAN SPEAK OF HIS FATHER I DON'T KNOW THAT I EVER DID OR HIS MOTHER OR HIS FAMILY DON'T YOU THINK THAT IS SUSPICIOUS
4297-13006-0029 I WOULD NOT WISH THAT THERE SHOULD BE OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCH ASKING IF THERE HAS BEEN INTIMACY BETWEEN YOU SUCH INFORMATION SHOULD HAVE COME NATURALLY AS A THING OF COURSE YOU HAVE MADE HIM NO PROMISE OH NO PAPA
4297-13006-0030 NOR SPOKEN TO HIM OF YOUR REGARD FOR HIM NEVER NOT A WORD NOR HE TO ME EXCEPT IN SUCH WORDS AS ONE UNDERSTANDS EVEN THOUGH THEY SAY NOTHING I WISH HE HAD NEVER SEEN YOU IS HE A BAD MAN PAPA
4297-13006-0031 PAPA I WISH YOU KNEW HIM BETTER THAN YOU DO I DO NOT WANT TO KNOW HIM BETTER IS NOT THAT PREJUDICE PAPA MY DEAR EMILY SAID MISTER WHARTON STRIVING TO WAX INTO ANGER
4297-13006-0032 THAT HE MIGHT BE FIRM AGAINST HER I DON'T THINK THAT IT BECOMES YOU TO ASK YOUR FATHER SUCH A QUESTION AS THAT YOU OUGHT TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS THE CHIEF OBJECT OF MY LIFE TO DO THE BEST I CAN FOR MY CHILDREN I AM SURE IT IS
4297-13006-0033 AND YOU OUGHT TO FEEL THAT AS I HAVE HAD A LONG EXPERIENCE IN THE WORLD MY JUDGMENT ABOUT A YOUNG MAN MIGHT BE TRUSTED THAT WAS A STATEMENT WHICH MISS WHARTON WAS NOT PREPARED TO ADMIT
4297-13006-0034 SHE HAD ALREADY PROFESSED HERSELF WILLING TO SUBMIT TO HER FATHER'S JUDGMENT AND DID NOT NOW BY ANY MEANS CONTEMPLATE REBELLION AGAINST PARENTAL AUTHORITY BUT SHE DID FEEL THAT ON A MATTER SO VITAL TO HER
4297-13006-0035 SHE HAD A RIGHT TO PLEAD HER CAUSE BEFORE JUDGMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN AND SHE WAS NOT SLOW TO ASSURE HERSELF EVEN AS THIS INTERVIEW WENT ON THAT HER LOVE FOR THE MAN WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO ENTITLE HER TO ASSURE HER FATHER THAT HER HAPPINESS DEPENDED ON HIS REVERSAL OF THE SENTENCE
4297-13006-0036 ALREADY PRONOUNCED YOU KNOW PAPA THAT I TRUST YOU SHE SAID AND I HAVE PROMISED YOU THAT I WILL NOT DISOBEY YOU
4297-13006-0037 YOU ARE A GOOD GIRL YOU WERE ALWAYS A GOOD GIRL BUT I THINK THAT YOU OUGHT TO HEAR ME THEN HE STOOD STILL WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS TROWSERS POCKETS LOOKING AT HER
4297-13006-0038 HE DID NOT WANT TO HEAR A WORD BUT HE FELT THAT HE WOULD BE A TYRANT IF HE REFUSED IF YOU TELL ME THAT I AM NOT TO SEE HIM I SHALL NOT SEE HIM BUT I SHALL BE VERY UNHAPPY I DO LOVE HIM AND I SHALL NEVER LOVE ANY ONE ELSE IN THE SAME WAY
4297-13006-0039 IF IT IS ONLY BECAUSE MISTER LOPEZ HAS A FOREIGN NAME IT ISN'T ONLY THAT NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT HIM OR WHERE TO INQUIRE EVEN I THINK YOU SHOULD INQUIRE PAPA AND BE QUITE CERTAIN BEFORE YOU PRONOUNCE SUCH A SENTENCE AGAINST ME
4297-13006-0040 IT WILL BE A CRUSHING BLOW HE LOOKED AT HER AND SAW THAT THERE WAS A FIXED PURPOSE IN HER COUNTENANCE OF WHICH HE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SIMILAR SIGNS YOU CLAIM A RIGHT TO MY OBEDIENCE AND I ACKNOWLEDGE IT
4297-13006-0041 I AM SURE YOU BELIEVE ME WHEN I PROMISE NOT TO SEE HIM WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION I DO BELIEVE YOU OF COURSE I BELIEVE YOU BUT IF I DO THAT FOR YOU PAPA I THINK THAT YOU OUGHT TO BE VERY SURE ON MY ACCOUNT
4297-13006-0042 I WILL OF COURSE I WILL AND HE BEGAN THE PROCESS OF THINKING ABOUT IT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE DOOR WAS CLOSED BEHIND HER BUT WHAT WAS THERE TO THINK ABOUT NOTHING THAT SHE HAD SAID ALTERED IN THE LEAST HIS IDEA ABOUT THE MAN
4297-13006-0043 HE WAS AS CONVINCED AS EVER THAT UNLESS THERE WAS MUCH TO CONCEAL THERE WOULD NOT BE SO MUCH CONCEALMENT BUT A FEELING BEGAN TO GROW UPON HIM ALREADY THAT HIS DAUGHTER HAD A MODE OF PLEADING WITH HIM WHICH HE WOULD NOT ULTIMATELY BE ABLE TO RESIST
4297-13006-0044 HE HAD THE POWER HE KNEW OF PUTTING AN END TO THE THING ALTOGETHER HE HAD ONLY TO SAY RESOLUTELY AND UNCHANGEABLY THAT THE THING SHOULDN'T BE AND IT WOULDN'T BE
4297-13009-0000 THEY WERE HABITUALLY INDIFFERENT TO SELF EXALTATION AND ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE THRUST INTO THIS OR THAT UNFITTING ROLE PROFESSING THAT THE QUEEN'S GOVERNMENT AND THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY WERE THEIR ONLY CONSIDERATIONS
4297-13009-0001 BECAUSE IT WAS FELT ON ALL SIDES THAT SIR ORLANDO COULD NOT JOIN THE NEW COMPOSITE PARTY WITHOUT HIGH PLACE AND THE SAME GRACE WAS SHOWN IN REGARD TO LORD DRUMMOND WHO REMAINED AT THE COLONIES KEEPING THE OFFICE TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN LATELY TRANSFERRED UNDER MISTER DAUBENY
4297-13009-0002 FOR LEGAL OFFICES HAVE A SIGNIFICATION DIFFERING MUCH FROM THAT WHICH ATTACHES ITSELF TO PLACES SIMPLY POLITICAL A LORD CHANCELLOR BECOMES A PEER AND ON GOING OUT OF OFFICE ENJOYS A LARGE PENSION WHEN THE WOOLSACK HAS BEEN REACHED THERE COMES AN END OF DOUBT
4297-13009-0003 AND A BEGINNING OF EASE SIR GREGORY WAS NOT A YOUNG MAN AND THIS WAS A TERRIBLE BLOW BUT HE BORE IT MANFULLY SAYING NOT A WORD WHEN THE DUKE SPOKE TO HIM BUT HE BECAME CONVINCED FROM THAT MOMENT THAT NO MORE INEFFICIENT LAWYER EVER SAT UPON THE ENGLISH BENCH
4297-13009-0004 OR A MORE PRESUMPTUOUS POLITICIAN IN THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT THAN LORD RAMSDEN THE REAL STRUGGLE HOWEVER LAY IN THE APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION OF THE RATTLERS AND THE ROBYS THE FITZGIBBONS AND THE MACPHERSONS AMONG THE SUBORDINATE OFFICES OF STATE
4297-13009-0005 MISTER MACPHERSON AND MISTER ROBY WITH A HOST OF OTHERS WHO HAD BELONGED TO MISTER DAUBENY WERE PREPARED AS THEY DECLARED FROM THE FIRST TO LEND THEIR ASSISTANCE TO THE DUKE THEY HAD CONSULTED MISTER DAUBENY ON THE SUBJECT AND MISTER DAUBENY TOLD THEM THAT THEIR DUTY LAY IN THAT DIRECTION
4297-13009-0006 AT THE FIRST BLUSH OF THE MATTER THE ARRANGEMENT TOOK THE FORM OF A GRACIOUS TENDER FROM THEMSELVES TO A STATESMAN CALLED UPON TO ACT IN VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY WERE THANKED ACCORDINGLY BY THE DUKE WITH SOMETHING OF REAL CORDIAL GRATITUDE
4297-13009-0007 HE WAS ASTOUNDED NOT SO MUCH BY THE PRETENSIONS AS BY THE UNBLUSHING ASSERTION OF THESE PRETENSIONS IN REFERENCE TO PLACES WHICH HE HAD BEEN INNOCENT ENOUGH TO THINK WERE ALWAYS BESTOWED AT ANY RATE WITHOUT DIRECT APPLICATION HE HAD MEASURED HIMSELF RIGHTLY WHEN HE TOLD THE OLDER DUKE
4297-13009-0008 IN ONE OF THOSE ANXIOUS CONVERSATIONS WHICH HAD BEEN HELD BEFORE THE ATTEMPT WAS MADE THAT LONG AS HE HAD BEEN IN OFFICE HIMSELF HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS THE WAY OF BESTOWING OFFICE TWO GENTLEMEN HAVE BEEN HERE THIS MORNING HE SAID ONE DAY TO THE DUKE OF SAINT BUNGAY
4297-13009-0009 ONE ON THE HEELS OF THE OTHER EACH ASSURING ME NOT ONLY THAT THE WHOLE STABILITY OF THE ENTERPRISE DEPENDS ON MY GIVING A CERTAIN OFFICE TO HIM BUT ACTUALLY TELLING ME TO MY FACE THAT I HAD PROMISED IT TO HIM THE OLD STATESMAN LAUGHED
4297-13009-0010 TO BE TOLD WITHIN THE SAME HALF HOUR BY TWO MEN THAT I HAD MADE PROMISES TO EACH OF THEM INCONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER WHO WERE THE TWO MEN MISTER RATTLER AND MISTER ROBY I AM ASSURED THAT THEY ARE INSEPARABLE SINCE THE WORK WAS BEGUN
4297-13009-0011 THEY ALWAYS HAD A LEANING TO EACH OTHER AND NOW I HEAR THEY PASS THEIR TIME BETWEEN THE STEPS OF THE CARLTON AND REFORM CLUBS BUT WHAT AM I TO DO ONE MUST BE PATRONAGE SECRETARY NO DOUBT THEY'RE BOTH GOOD MEN IN THEIR WAY YOU KNOW
4297-13009-0012 BUT WHY DO THEY COME TO ME WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN LIKE DOGS CRAVING A BONE IT USED NOT TO BE SO OF COURSE MEN WERE ALWAYS ANXIOUS FOR OFFICE AS THEY ARE NOW WELL YES WE'VE HEARD OF THAT BEFORE TO DAY I THINK
4297-13009-0013 BUT I DON'T THINK ANY MAN EVER VENTURED TO ASK MISTER MILDMAY TIME HAD DONE MUCH FOR HIM IN CONSOLIDATING HIS AUTHORITY AND PERHAPS THE PRESENT WORLD IS LESS RETICENT IN ITS EAGERNESS THAN IT WAS IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS I DOUBT HOWEVER
4297-13009-0014 WHETHER IT IS MORE DISHONEST AND WHETHER STRUGGLES WERE NOT MADE QUITE AS DISGRACEFUL TO THE STRUGGLERS AS ANYTHING THAT IS DONE NOW YOU CAN'T ALTER THE MEN AND YOU MUST USE THEM THE YOUNGER DUKE SAT DOWN AND SIGHED OVER THE DEGENERATE PATRIOTISM OF THE AGE
4297-13009-0015 BUT AT LAST EVEN THE RATTLERS AND ROBYS WERE FIXED IF NOT SATISFIED AND A COMPLETE LIST OF THE MINISTRY APPEARED IN ALL THE NEWSPAPERS THOUGH THE THING HAD BEEN LONG A DOING STILL IT HAD COME SUDDENLY
4297-13009-0016 SO THAT AT THE FIRST PROPOSITION TO FORM A COALITION MINISTRY THE NEWSPAPERS HAD HARDLY KNOWN WHETHER TO ASSIST OR TO OPPOSE THE SCHEME THERE WAS NO DOUBT IN THE MINDS OF ALL THESE EDITORS AND CONTRIBUTORS THE TEACHING OF A TRADITION THAT COALITIONS OF THIS KIND HAVE BEEN GENERALLY FEEBLE
4297-13009-0017 SOMETIMES DISASTROUS AND ON OCCASIONS EVEN DISGRACEFUL WHEN A MAN PERHAPS THROUGH A LONG POLITICAL LIFE HAS BOUND HIMSELF TO A CERTAIN CODE OF OPINIONS HOW CAN HE CHANGE THAT CODE AT A MOMENT
4297-13009-0018 AND WHEN AT THE SAME MOMENT TOGETHER WITH THE CHANGE HE SECURES POWER PATRONAGE AND PAY HOW SHALL THE PUBLIC VOICE ABSOLVE HIM BUT THEN AGAIN MEN WHO HAVE BY THE WORK OF THEIR LIVES GROWN INTO A CERTAIN POSITION IN THE COUNTRY
4297-13009-0019 AND HAVE UNCONSCIOUSLY BUT NOT THEREFORE LESS ACTUALLY MADE THEMSELVES INDISPENSABLE EITHER TO THIS SIDE IN POLITICS OR TO THAT CANNOT FREE THEMSELVES ALTOGETHER FROM THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MANAGING THEM WHEN A PERIOD COMES SUCH AS THAT NOW REACHED
4297-13009-0020 THIS ALSO THE NEWSPAPERS PERCEIVED AND HAVING SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SESSION BEEN VERY LOUD IN EXPOSING THE DISGRACEFUL COLLAPSE OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COULD HARDLY REFUSE THEIR SUPPORT TO ANY ATTEMPT AT A FEASIBLE ARRANGEMENT
4297-13009-0021 WHEN IT WAS FIRST KNOWN THAT THE DUKE OF OMNIUM HAD CONSENTED TO MAKE THE ATTEMPT THEY HAD BOTH ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER BEEN LOUD IN HIS PRAISE GOING SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT HE WAS THE ONLY MAN IN ENGLAND WHO COULD DO THE WORK
4297-13009-0022 BUT WHEN THE NEWSPAPERS TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS THE ONLY MAN FOR THE OCCASION HOW COULD HE BE JUSTIFIED IN CREDITING HIMSELF IN PREFERENCE TO THEM THE WORK IN PARLIAMENT BEGAN UNDER THE NEW AUSPICES WITH GREAT TRANQUILLITY
4297-13009-0023 AND FURTHER EDUCATION QUESTIONS ALL MEN KNEW WHO KNEW ANYTHING BUT FOR THE MOMENT FOR THE MONTH EVEN PERHAPS FOR THE SESSION THERE WAS TO BE PEACE WITH FULL LATITUDE FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF ROUTINE DUTIES THERE WAS SO TO SAY NO OPPOSITION
4297-13009-0024 AND AT FIRST IT SEEMED THAT ONE SPECIAL BENCH IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WOULD REMAIN UNOCCUPIED BUT AFTER A DAY OR TWO ON ONE OF WHICH MISTER DAUBENY HAD BEEN SEEN SITTING JUST BELOW THE GANGWAY THAT GENTLEMAN RETURNED TO THE PLACE USUALLY HELD BY THE PRIME MINISTER'S RIVAL
4297-13009-0025 SAYING WITH A SMILE THAT IT MIGHT BE FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE HOUSE THAT THE SEAT SHOULD BE UTILISED MISTER GRESHAM AT THIS TIME HAD WITH DECLARED PURPOSE ASKED AND OBTAINED THE SPEAKER'S LEAVE OF ABSENCE AND WAS ABROAD WHO SHOULD LEAD THE HOUSE
4297-13009-0026 THAT HAD BEEN A GREAT QUESTION CAUSED BY THE FACT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WAS IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS AND WHAT OFFICE SHOULD THE LEADER HOLD MISTER MONK HAD CONSENTED TO TAKE THE EXCHEQUER
4297-13009-0027 WAS AT LAST ASSIGNED TO SIR ORLANDO DROUGHT IT WILL NEVER DO SAID MISTER RATTLER TO MISTER ROBY I DON'T MEAN TO SAY ANYTHING AGAINST DROUGHT WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN A VERY USEFUL MAN TO YOUR PARTY BUT HE LACKS SOMETHING OF THE POSITION
4297-13009-0028 THE FACT IS SAID ROBY THAT WE'VE TRUSTED TO TWO MEN SO LONG THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO SUPPOSE ANY ONE ELSE BIG ENOUGH TO FILL THEIR PLACES MONK WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THE HOUSE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT MONK I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT SHOULD BE WILSON
4297-13009-0029 AND SO I TOLD THE DUKE HE HAD AN IDEA THAT IT SHOULD BE ONE OF YOUR MEN I THINK HE'S RIGHT THERE SAID ROBY THERE OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING LIKE A FAIR DIVISION INDIVIDUALS MIGHT BE CONTENT BUT THE PARTY WOULD BE DISSATISFIED
4297-13009-0030 FOR MYSELF I'D HAVE SOONER STAYED OUT AS AN INDEPENDENT MEMBER BUT DAUBENY SAID THAT HE THOUGHT I WAS BOUND TO MAKE MYSELF USEFUL I TOLD THE DUKE FROM THE BEGINNING SAID RATTLER THAT I DIDN'T THINK THAT I COULD BE OF ANY SERVICE TO HIM
4297-13009-0031 OF COURSE I WOULD SUPPORT HIM BUT I HAD BEEN TOO THOROUGHLY A PARTY MAN FOR A NEW MOVEMENT OF THIS KIND BUT HE SAID JUST THE SAME THAT HE CONSIDERED I WAS BOUND TO JOIN HIM I ASKED GRESHAM AND WHEN GRESHAM SAID SO TOO OF COURSE I HAD NO HELP FOR IT
4297-13009-0032 A MEANING TO A MAN'S WORDS EXACTLY OPPOSITE TO THAT WHICH ANOTHER TONE WOULD CONVEY OR IF HE DOES LIE IN DOING SO HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT HE LIES MISTER RATTLER HAD GONE BACK TO HIS OLD OFFICE AT THE TREASURY
4297-13009-0033 AND MISTER ROBY HAD BEEN FORCED TO CONTENT HIMSELF WITH THE SECRETARYSHIP AT THE ADMIRALTY BUT AS THE OLD DUKE HAD SAID THEY WERE CLOSE FRIENDS AND PREPARED TO FIGHT TOGETHER ANY BATTLE WHICH MIGHT KEEP THEM IN THEIR PRESENT POSITION
4297-13009-0034 MANY OF THE CARES OF OFFICE THE PRIME MINISTER DID SUCCEED IN SHUFFLING OFF ALTOGETHER ON TO THE SHOULDERS OF HIS ELDER FRIEND HE WOULD NOT CONCERN HIMSELF WITH THE APPOINTMENT OF LADIES ABOUT WHOM HE SAID HE KNEW NOTHING
4297-13009-0035 AND AS TO WHOSE FITNESS AND CLAIMS HE PROFESSED HIMSELF TO BE AS IGNORANT AS THE OFFICE MESSENGER THE OFFERS WERE OF COURSE MADE IN THE USUAL FORM AS THOUGH COMING DIRECT FROM THE QUEEN THROUGH THE PRIME MINISTER BUT THE SELECTIONS WERE IN TRUTH EFFECTED BY THE OLD DUKE IN COUNCIL WITH
4297-13009-0036 AN ILLUSTRIOUS PERSONAGE THE MATTER AFFECTED OUR DUKE ONLY IN SO FAR THAT HE COULD NOT GET OUT OF HIS MIND THAT STRANGE APPLICATION FROM HIS OWN WIFE THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE EVEN DREAMED OF IT HE WOULD SAY TO HIMSELF
4297-13009-0037 THE DESIRE FOR PLOUGHING HAD COME UPON THE DUCHESS BUT THE DUKE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT HE PERCEIVED HOWEVER IN SPITE OF THE MULTIPLICITY OF HIS OFFICIAL WORK THAT HIS REFUSAL SAT HEAVILY ON HIS WIFE'S BREAST AND THAT THOUGH SHE SPOKE NO FURTHER WORD
4297-13009-0038 SHE BROODED OVER HER INJURY AND HIS HEART WAS SAD WITHIN HIM WHEN HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD VEXED HER LOVING HER AS HE DID WITH ALL HIS HEART BUT WITH A HEART THAT WAS NEVER DEMONSTRATIVE WHEN SHE WAS UNHAPPY HE WAS MISERABLE
4297-13009-0039 THOUGH HE WOULD HARDLY KNOW THE CAUSE OF HIS MISERY HER RIDICULE AND RAILLERY HE COULD BEAR
4297-13009-0040 OR HER SULLENNESS IF EVER SHE WERE SULLEN UPSET HIM ALTOGETHER HE WAS IN TRUTH SO SOFT OF HEART
4297-13009-0041 HE HAD EXPRESSLY ASKED HER FOR HER SYMPATHY IN THE BUSINESS HE HAD ON HAND THEREBY GOING MUCH BEYOND HIS USUAL COLDNESS OF MANNER
4297-13009-0042 HAD PROMISED THAT SHE WOULD SLAVE FOR HIM IF SLAVERY WERE NECESSARY THEN SHE HAD MADE HER REQUEST HAD BEEN REFUSED AND WAS NOW MOODY THE DUCHESS OF
4297-13009-0043 IS TO BE MISTRESS OF THE ROBES HE SAID TO HER ONE DAY HE HAD GONE TO HER UP TO HER OWN ROOM BEFORE HE DRESSED FOR DINNER HAVING DEVOTED MUCH MORE TIME THAN AS PRIME MINISTER HE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE TO A RESOLUTION THAT HE WOULD MAKE THINGS STRAIGHT WITH HER AND TO THE BEST WAY OF DOING IT
4297-13009-0044 SO I AM TOLD SHE OUGHT TO KNOW HER WAY ABOUT THE PLACE AS I REMEMBER SHE WAS AT THE SAME WORK WHEN I WAS A GIRL OF ELEVEN THAT'S NOT SO VERY LONG AGO CORA SILVERBRIDGE IS OLDER NOW THAN I WAS THEN
4297-13009-0045 AND I THINK THAT MAKES IT A VERY LONG TIME AGO LORD SILVERBRIDGE WAS THE DUKE'S ELDEST SON BUT WHAT DOES IT MATTER IF SHE BEGAN HER CAREER IN THE TIME OF GEORGE THE FOURTH WHAT IS IT TO YOU
4297-13009-0046 IT'S A PITY SHE SHOULD NOT REMEMBER HERS IN THE WAY SHE DRESSES SAID THE DUCHESS THIS WAS MARVELLOUS TO HIM THAT HIS WIFE
4297-13009-0047 THAT IT WON'T COME WITHIN THE COMPASS OF MY OFFICE TO EFFECT OR EVEN TO PROPOSE ANY RADICAL CHANGE IN HER GRACE'S APPAREL BUT DON'T YOU THINK THAT YOU AND I CAN AFFORD TO IGNORE ALL THAT I CAN CERTAINLY SHE MAY BE AN ANTIQUATED EVE FOR ME
4297-13009-0048 I HOPE CORA YOU ARE NOT STILL DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I DID NOT AGREE WITH YOU WHEN YOU SPOKE ABOUT THE PLACE FOR YOURSELF NOT BECAUSE YOU DID NOT AGREE WITH ME BUT BECAUSE YOU DID NOT THINK ME FIT TO BE TRUSTED WITH ANY JUDGMENT OF MY OWN
4297-13009-0049 AND FREE FROM BONDS BY WHICH THEY ARE CRAMPED AND CONFINED OF COURSE SUCH A TURN OF CHARACTER IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DANGERS OF ITS OWN THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THE DANGERS THE CHANCES ARE THAT WHEN I SEE HER GRACE I SHALL TELL HER WHAT I THINK ABOUT HER
4297-13009-0050 YOU WILL I AM SURE SAY NOTHING UNKIND TO A LADY WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE PLACE SHE NOW FILLS BY MY AUTHORITY BUT DO NOT LET US QUARREL ABOUT AN OLD WOMAN I WON'T QUARREL WITH YOU EVEN ABOUT A YOUNG ONE
4297-13009-0051 YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW CONSTANTLY I CARRY YOU ABOUT WITH ME YOU CARRY A VERY UNNECESSARY BURDEN THEN SHE SAID BUT HE COULD TELL AT ONCE FROM THE ALTERED TONE OF HER VOICE AND FROM THE LIGHT OF HER EYE AS HE GLANCED INTO HER FACE
4297-13009-0052 THAT HER ANGER ABOUT THE ROBES WAS APPEASED I HAVE DONE AS YOU ASKED ABOUT A FRIEND OF YOURS HE SAID THIS OCCURRED JUST BEFORE THE FINAL AND PERFECTED LIST OF THE NEW MEN HAD APPEARED IN ALL THE NEWSPAPERS WHAT FRIEND
4297-13009-0053 MISTER FINN IS TO GO TO IRELAND GO TO IRELAND HOW DO YOU MEAN IT IS LOOKED UPON AS BEING VERY GREAT PROMOTION INDEED I AM TOLD THAT HE IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE LUCKIEST MAN IN ALL THE SCRAMBLE YOU DON'T MEAN AS CHIEF SECRETARY
4297-13009-0054 YES I DO HE CERTAINLY COULDN'T GO AS LORD LIEUTENANT BUT THEY SAID THAT BARRINGTON ERLE WAS GOING TO IRELAND WELL YES I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU'D BE INTERESTED BY ALL THE INS AND OUTS OF IT
4297-13009-0055 THE ONE MAN IN PARLIAMENT MODEST ENOUGH NOT TO CONSIDER HIMSELF TO BE FIT FOR ANY PLACE THAT CAN BE OFFERED TO HIM POOR BARRINGTON HE DOES NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF CROSSING THE CHANNEL SO OFTEN I QUITE SYMPATHISE WITH HIM AND SO PHINEAS IS TO BE SECRETARY FOR IRELAND
4297-13009-0056 NOT IN THE CABINET NO NOT IN THE CABINET IT IS NOT BY ANY MEANS USUAL THAT HE SHOULD BE THAT IS PROMOTION AND I AM GLAD POOR PHINEAS I HOPE THEY WON'T MURDER HIM OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND
4297-13009-0057 THEY DO MURDER PEOPLE YOU KNOW SOMETIMES HE'S AN IRISHMAN HIMSELF THAT'S JUST THE REASON WHY THEY SHOULD HE MUST PUT UP WITH THAT OF COURSE I WONDER WHETHER SHE'LL LIKE GOING THEY'LL BE ABLE TO SPEND MONEY WHICH THEY ALWAYS LIKE
4297-13009-0058 OVER THERE HE COMES BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS EVERY WEEK DOESN'T HE NOT QUITE THAT I BELIEVE I SHALL MISS HER IF SHE HAS TO STAY AWAY LONG I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE HER I DO LIKE HER
4297-13009-0059 SHE HAS ALWAYS BEHAVED WELL BOTH TO ME AND TO MY UNCLE SHE WAS AN ANGEL TO HIM
4297-13009-0060 THIS SHE SAID WITH A SMILE AS THOUGH NOT MEANING IT ALTOGETHER BUT YET HALF MEANING IT I HAVE ASKED HIM TO UNDERTAKE THE OFFICE SAID THE DUKE SOLEMNLY BECAUSE I AM TOLD THAT HE IS FIT FOR IT
4297-13009-0061 BUT I DID HAVE SOME PLEASURE IN PROPOSING IT TO HIM BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD PLEASE YOU IT DOES PLEASE ME AND I WON'T BE CROSS ANY MORE AND THE DUCHESS OF
4297-13009-0062 BUT SHE IS IN TRUTH THE ONLY WOMAN IN LONDON TO WHOM I CAN SAY WHAT I THINK AND IT IS A COMFORT YOU KNOW TO HAVE SOME ONE IN THIS WAY THE DOMESTIC PEACE OF THE PRIME MINISTER WAS READJUSTED
4297-13009-0063 AND THAT SYMPATHY AND CO OPERATION FOR WHICH HE HAD FIRST ASKED WAS ACCORDED TO HIM IT MAY BE A QUESTION WHETHER ON THE WHOLE THE DUCHESS DID NOT WORK HARDER THAN HE DID
4297-13009-0064 IN REGARD TO MAGNIFICENCE AND HOSPITALITY SHE SAID NOTHING OF ANY EXTRAORDINARY EXPENDITURE OF MONEY BUT SHE SET HERSELF TO WORK AFTER HER OWN FASHION MAKING TO HIM SUGGESTIONS AS TO DINNERS AND EVENING RECEPTIONS
4297-13009-0065 TO WHICH HE OBJECTED ONLY ON THE SCORE OF TIME YOU MUST EAT YOUR DINNER SOMEWHERE SHE SAID AND YOU NEED ONLY COME IN JUST BEFORE WE SIT DOWN AND GO INTO YOUR OWN ROOM IF YOU PLEASE WITHOUT COMING UPSTAIRS AT ALL I CAN AT ANY RATE DO THAT PART OF IT FOR YOU

4340-15220-0092 FISHING OUT SEVERAL FRAGMENTS OF GINGERBREAD STARVING AND BAB ATE THEM WITH SUCH A RELISH THAT SAM ADDED A SMALL CONTRIBUTION AND BEN CAUGHT SOME WATER FOR HER IN HIS HAND WHERE THE LITTLE SPRING BUBBLED UP BESIDE A STONE NOW
4340-15220-0093 COMMANDED BEN GIVING SANCH A ROLL ON THE GRASS TO CLEAN HIM BAB SCRUBBED HER FACE TILL IT SHONE AND PULLING DOWN HER APRON TO WIPE IT SCATTERED A LOAD OF TREASURES COLLECTED IN HER WALK SOME OF THE DEAD FLOWERS
4340-15220-0094 BITS OF MOSS AND GREEN TWIGS FELL NEAR BEN AND ONE ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION A SPRAY OF BROAD SMOOTH LEAVES WITH A BUNCH OF WHITISH BERRIES ON IT WHERE DID YOU GET THAT HE ASKED POKING IT WITH HIS FOOT
4340-15220-0095 IN A SWAMPY PLACE COMING ALONG SANCH SAW SOMETHING DOWN THERE AND I WENT WITH HIM CAUSE I THOUGHT MAY BE IT WAS A MUSK RAT AND YOU'D LIKE ONE IF WE COULD GET HIM

4340-15220-0098 AND I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF YOU'D GOT POISONED BAB DON'T TOUCH IT
4340-15220-0099 AND BEN LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT BAB WHO FELT HER CHUBBY FACE ALL OVER AND EXAMINED HER DINGY HANDS WITH A SOLEMN AIR ASKING EAGERLY WILL IT BREAK OUT ON ME FORE I GET TO THE CIRCUS
4340-15220-0100 NOT FOR A DAY OR SO I GUESS BUT IT'S BAD WHEN IT DOES COME
4362-15663-0000 A PERILOUS NIGHT ON SHASTA'S SUMMIT TOWARD THE END OF SUMMER AFTER A LIGHT OPEN WINTER ONE MAY REACH THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT SHASTA WITHOUT PASSING OVER MUCH SNOW BY KEEPING ON THE CREST OF A LONG NARROW RIDGE
4362-15663-0001 MOSTLY BARE THAT EXTENDS FROM NEAR THE CAMP GROUND AT THE TIMBERLINE BUT ON MY FIRST EXCURSION TO THE SUMMIT THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN DOWN TO ITS LOW SWELLING BASE WAS SMOOTHLY LADEN WITH LOOSE FRESH SNOW
4362-15663-0002 PRESENTING A MOST GLORIOUS MASS OF WINTER MOUNTAIN SCENERY IN THE MIDST OF WHICH I SCRAMBLED AND REVELED OR LAY SNUGLY SNOWBOUND ENJOYING THE FERTILE CLOUDS AND THE SNOW BLOOM IN ALL THEIR GROWING DRIFTING GRANDEUR
4362-15663-0003 THE FIRST RAINS HAD FALLEN ON THE LOWLANDS AND THE FIRST SNOWS ON THE MOUNTAINS AND EVERYTHING WAS FRESH AND BRACING WHILE AN ABUNDANCE OF BALMY SUNSHINE FILLED ALL THE NOONDAY HOURS
4362-15663-0004 IT WAS THE CALM AFTERGLOW THAT USUALLY SUCCEEDS THE FIRST STORM OF THE WINTER I MET MANY OF THE BIRDS THAT HAD REARED THEIR YOUNG AND SPENT THEIR SUMMER IN THE SHASTA WOODS AND CHAPARRAL THEY WERE THEN ON THEIR WAY SOUTH TO THEIR WINTER HOMES
4362-15663-0005 LEADING THEIR YOUNG FULL FLEDGED AND ABOUT AS LARGE AND STRONG AS THE PARENTS SQUIRRELS DRY AND ELASTIC AFTER THE STORMS WERE BUSY ABOUT THEIR STORES OF PINE NUTS AND THE LATEST GOLDENRODS WERE STILL IN BLOOM THOUGH IT WAS NOW PAST THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER
4362-15663-0006 THE GRAND COLOR GLOW THE AUTUMNAL JUBILEE OF RIPE LEAVES WAS PAST PRIME BUT FRESHENED BY THE RAIN WAS STILL MAKING A FINE SHOW ALONG THE BANKS OF THE RIVER AND IN THE RAVINES AND THE DELLS OF THE SMALLER STREAMS
4362-15663-0007 AT THE SALMON HATCHING ESTABLISHMENT ON THE MC CLOUD RIVER I HALTED A WEEK TO EXAMINE THE LIMESTONE BELT GRANDLY DEVELOPED THERE TO LEARN WHAT I COULD OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE RIVER AND ITS BANKS
4362-15663-0008 AND TO GIVE TIME FOR THE FRESH SNOW THAT I KNEW HAD FALLEN ON THE MOUNTAIN TO SETTLE SOMEWHAT WITH A VIEW TO MAKING THE ASCENT A PEDESTRIAN ON THESE MOUNTAIN ROADS ESPECIALLY SO LATE IN THE YEAR IS SURE TO EXCITE CURIOSITY
4362-15663-0009 AND MANY WERE THE INTERROGATIONS CONCERNING MY RAMBLE WHEN I SAID THAT I WAS SIMPLY TAKING A WALK AND THAT ICY SHASTA WAS MY MARK I WAS INVARIABLY ADMONISHED THAT I HAD COME ON A DANGEROUS QUEST THE TIME WAS FAR TOO LATE
4362-15663-0010 THE SNOW WAS TOO LOOSE AND DEEP TO CLIMB AND I SHOULD BE LOST IN DRIFTS AND SLIDES WHEN I HINTED THAT NEW SNOW WAS BEAUTIFUL AND STORMS NOT SO BAD AS THEY WERE CALLED MY ADVISERS SHOOK THEIR HEADS IN TOKEN OF SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE
4362-15663-0011 AND DECLARED THE ASCENT OF SHASTA BUTTE THROUGH LOOSE SNOW IMPOSSIBLE NEVERTHELESS BEFORE NOON OF THE SECOND OF NOVEMBER I WAS IN THE FROSTY AZURE OF THE UTMOST SUMMIT WHEN I ARRIVED AT SISSON'S EVERYTHING WAS QUIET
4362-15663-0012 AND I WAS IN HASTE TO BE OFF AND GET MYSELF ESTABLISHED SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDST OF IT WHETHER THE SUMMIT WAS TO BE ATTAINED OR NOT SISSON WHO IS A MOUNTAINEER SPEEDILY FITTED ME OUT FOR STORM OR CALM AS ONLY A MOUNTAINEER COULD
4362-15663-0013 AND THE FROSTS AND THE DANGERS OF MOUNTAINEERING SO LATE IN THE YEAR THEREFORE I COULD NOT ASK A GUIDE TO GO WITH ME EVEN HAD ONE BEEN WILLING ALL I WANTED WAS TO HAVE BLANKETS AND PROVISIONS DEPOSITED AS FAR UP IN THE TIMBER AS THE SNOW WOULD PERMIT A PACK ANIMAL TO GO
4362-15663-0014 THERE I COULD BUILD A STORM NEST AND LIE WARM AND MAKE RAIDS UP AND AROUND THE MOUNTAIN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WEATHER SETTING OUT ON THE AFTERNOON OF NOVEMBER FIRST WITH JEROME FAY MOUNTAINEER AND GUIDE IN CHARGE OF THE ANIMALS
4362-15663-0015 THE SNOW OF COURSE GROWING STEADILY DEEPER AND LOOSER SO THAT WE HAD TO BREAK A TRAIL THE ANIMALS BEGAN TO GET DISCOURAGED AND AFTER NIGHT AND DARKNESS CAME ON THEY BECAME ENTANGLED IN A BED OF ROUGH LAVA
4362-15663-0016 WHERE BREAKING THROUGH FOUR OR FIVE FEET OF MEALY SNOW THEIR FEET WERE CAUGHT BETWEEN ANGULAR BOULDERS HERE THEY WERE IN DANGER OF BEING LOST BUT AFTER WE HAD REMOVED PACKS AND SADDLES AND ASSISTED THEIR EFFORTS WITH ROPES
4362-15663-0017 THEY ALL ESCAPED TO THE SIDE OF A RIDGE ABOUT A THOUSAND FEET BELOW THE TIMBERLINE TO GO FARTHER WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION SO WE WERE COMPELLED TO CAMP AS BEST WE COULD A PITCH PINE FIRE SPEEDILY CHANGED THE TEMPERATURE
4362-15663-0018 AND SHED A BLAZE OF LIGHT ON THE WILD LAVA SLOPE AND THE STRAGGLING STORM BENT PINES AROUND US MELTED SNOW ANSWERED FOR COFFEE AND WE HAD PLENTY OF VENISON TO ROAST TOWARD MIDNIGHT I ROLLED MYSELF IN MY BLANKETS SLEPT AN HOUR AND A HALF
4362-15663-0019 AND INDICATED THE WAY AS WELL AS HE COULD IN THE DARKNESS HE SEEMED LOATH TO LEAVE ME BUT BEING REASSURED THAT I WAS AT HOME AND REQUIRED NO CARE HE BADE ME GOOD BYE AND RETURNED TO CAMP READY TO LEAD HIS ANIMALS DOWN THE MOUNTAIN AT DAYBREAK
4362-15663-0020 ALONE IN THE SOLEMN SILENCE OF THE NIGHT HALF THE SKY WAS CLOUDED IN THE OTHER HALF THE STARS SPARKLED ICILY IN THE KEEN FROSTY AIR WHILE EVERYWHERE THE GLORIOUS WEALTH OF SNOW
4362-15663-0021 FELL AWAY FROM THE SUMMIT OF THE CONE IN FLOWING FOLDS MORE EXTENSIVE AND CONTINUOUS THAN ANY I HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE WHEN DAY DAWNED THE CLOUDS WERE CRAWLING SLOWLY AND BECOMING MORE MASSIVE BUT GAVE NO INTIMATION OF IMMEDIATE DANGER
4362-15663-0022 IN BLANK EXPOSURE TO THE DEEP UPPER CURRENTS OF THE SKY AND NO LABYRINTH OF PEAKS AND CANYONS I HAD EVER BEEN IN SEEMED TO ME SO DANGEROUS AS THESE IMMENSE SLOPES BARE AGAINST THE SKY
4362-15663-0023 THE FROST WAS INTENSE AND DRIFTING SNOW DUST MADE BREATHING AT TIMES RATHER DIFFICULT THE SNOW WAS AS DRY AS MEAL AND THE FINER PARTICLES DRIFTED FREELY RISING HIGH IN THE AIR WHILE THE LARGER PORTIONS OF THE CRYSTALS ROLLED LIKE SAND
4362-15663-0024 I FREQUENTLY SANK TO MY ARMPITS BETWEEN BURIED BLOCKS OF LOOSE LAVA BUT GENERALLY ONLY TO MY KNEES WHEN TIRED WITH WALKING I STILL WALLOWED SLOWLY UPWARD ON ALL FOURS THE STEEPNESS OF THE SLOPE
4362-15663-0025 THIRTY FIVE DEGREES IN SOME PLACES MADE ANY KIND OF PROGRESS FATIGUING WHILE SMALL AVALANCHES WERE BEING CONSTANTLY SET IN MOTION IN THE STEEPEST PLACES BUT THE BRACING AIR AND THE SUBLIME BEAUTY OF THE SNOWY EXPANSE
4362-15663-0026 THRILLED EVERY NERVE AND MADE ABSOLUTE EXHAUSTION IMPOSSIBLE I SEEMED TO BE WALKING AND WALLOWING IN A CLOUD BUT HOLDING STEADILY ONWARD BY HALF PAST TEN O'CLOCK I HAD GAINED THE HIGHEST SUMMIT
4362-15663-0027 I HELD MY COMMANDING FOOTHOLD IN THE SKY FOR TWO HOURS GAZING ON THE GLORIOUS LANDSCAPES SPREAD MAPLIKE AROUND THE IMMENSE HORIZON AND TRACING THE OUTLINES OF THE ANCIENT LAVA STREAMS EXTENDING FAR INTO THE SURROUNDING PLAINS
4362-15663-0028 AND THE PATHWAYS OF VANISHED GLACIERS OF WHICH SHASTA HAD BEEN THE CENTER BUT AS I HAD LEFT MY COAT IN CAMP FOR THE SAKE OF HAVING MY LIMBS FREE IN CLIMBING I SOON WAS COLD THE WIND INCREASED IN VIOLENCE
4362-15663-0029 RAISING THE SNOW IN MAGNIFICENT DRIFTS THAT WERE DRAWN OUT IN THE FORM OF WAVERING BANNERS BLOWING IN THE SUN TOWARD THE END OF MY STAY A SUCCESSION OF SMALL CLOUDS STRUCK AGAINST THE SUMMIT ROCKS LIKE DRIFTING ICEBERGS
4362-15663-0030 DARKENING THE AIR AS THEY PASSED AND PRODUCING A CHILL AS DEFINITE AND SUDDEN AS IF ICE WATER HAD BEEN DASHED IN MY FACE THIS IS THE KIND OF CLOUD IN WHICH SNOW FLOWERS GROW AND I TURNED AND FLED
4362-15663-0031 I REACHED CAMP ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE DUSK HOLLOWED A STRIP OF LOOSE GROUND IN THE LEE OF A LARGE BLOCK OF RED LAVA WHERE FIREWOOD WAS ABUNDANT ROLLED MYSELF IN MY BLANKETS AND WENT TO SLEEP NEXT MORNING
4362-15663-0032 HAVING SLEPT LITTLE THE NIGHT BEFORE THE ASCENT AND BEING WEARY WITH CLIMBING AFTER THE EXCITEMENT WAS OVER I SLEPT LATE THEN AWAKING SUDDENLY MY EYES OPENED ON ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND SUBLIME SCENES I EVER ENJOYED A BOUNDLESS WILDERNESS OF STORM CLOUDS
4362-15663-0033 UNDULATING HILL AND DALE SMOOTH PURPLE PLAINS AND SILVERY MOUNTAINS OF CUMULI RANGE OVER RANGE DIVERSIFIED WITH PEAK AND DOME AND HOLLOW FULLY BROUGHT OUT IN LIGHT AND SHADE I GAZED ENCHANTED
4362-15663-0034 BUT COLD GRAY MASSES DRIFTING LIKE DUST ON A WIND SWEPT PLAIN BEGAN TO SHUT OUT THE LIGHT FORERUNNERS OF THE COMING STORM I HAD BEEN SO ANXIOUSLY WATCHING I MADE HASTE TO GATHER AS MUCH WOOD AS POSSIBLE
4362-15663-0035 THE STORM SIDE OF MY BLANKETS WAS FASTENED DOWN WITH STAKES TO REDUCE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE SIFTING IN OF DRIFT AND THE DANGER OF BEING BLOWN AWAY THE PRECIOUS BREAD SACK WAS PLACED SAFELY AS A PILLOW AND WHEN AT LENGTH THE FIRST FLAKES FELL
4362-15663-0036 I WAS EXULTINGLY READY TO WELCOME THEM MOST OF MY FIREWOOD WAS MORE THAN HALF ROSIN AND WOULD BLAZE IN THE FACE OF THE FIERCEST DRIFTING THE WINDS COULD NOT DEMOLISH MY BED AND MY BREAD COULD BE MADE TO LAST INDEFINITELY
4362-15663-0037 WHILE IN CASE OF NEED I HAD THE MEANS OF MAKING SNOWSHOES AND COULD RETREAT OR HOLD MY GROUND AS I PLEASED PRESENTLY THE STORM BROKE FORTH INTO FULL SNOWY BLOOM AND THE THRONGING CRYSTALS DARKENED THE AIR
4362-15663-0038 THE WIND SWEPT PAST IN HISSING FLOODS GRINDING THE SNOW INTO MEAL AND SWEEPING DOWN INTO THE HOLLOWS IN ENORMOUS DRIFTS ALL THE HEAVIER PARTICLES WHILE THE FINER DUST WAS SIFTED THROUGH THE SKY INCREASING THE ICY GLOOM
4362-15663-0039 AND THE PASSIONATE UPROAR PRODUCED A GLAD EXCITEMENT DAY AFTER DAY THE STORM CONTINUED PILING SNOW ON SNOW IN WEARILESS ABUNDANCE
4362-15663-0040 AS IF TO KNOW HOW THE WORK WAS ADVANCING DURING THESE CALM INTERVALS I REPLENISHED MY FIRE SOMETIMES WITHOUT LEAVING THE NEST FOR FIRE AND WOODPILE WERE SO NEAR THIS COULD EASILY BE DONE OR BUSIED MYSELF WITH MY NOTEBOOK
4362-15663-0041 WATCHING THE GESTURES OF THE TREES IN TAKING THE SNOW EXAMINING SEPARATE CRYSTALS UNDER A LENS AND LEARNING THE METHODS OF THEIR DEPOSITION AS AN ENDURING FOUNTAIN FOR THE STREAMS SEVERAL TIMES WHEN THE STORM CEASED FOR A FEW MINUTES
4362-15663-0042 A DOUGLAS SQUIRREL CAME FRISKING FROM THE FOOT OF A CLUMP OF DWARF PINES MOVING IN SUDDEN INTERRUPTED SPURTS OVER THE BOSSY SNOW THEN WITHOUT ANY APPARENT GUIDANCE HE WOULD DIG RAPIDLY INTO THE DRIFT WHERE WERE BURIED SOME GRAINS OF BARLEY THAT THE HORSES HAD LEFT
4362-15663-0043 THE DOUGLAS SQUIRREL DOES NOT STRICTLY BELONG TO THESE UPPER WOODS AND I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE HIM OUT IN SUCH WEATHER THE MOUNTAIN SHEEP ALSO QUITE A LARGE FLOCK OF THEM CAME TO MY CAMP AND TOOK SHELTER BESIDE A CLUMP OF MATTED DWARF PINES
4362-15663-0044 AND HE MUST SURELY HAVE PERISHED AND SISSON WAS BLAMED FOR ALLOWING ANY ONE TO ATTEMPT CLIMBING IN SUCH WEATHER WHILE I WAS AS SAFE AS ANYBODY IN THE LOWLANDS LYING LIKE A SQUIRREL IN A WARM FLUFFY NEST BUSIED ABOUT MY OWN AFFAIRS AND WISHING ONLY TO BE LET ALONE
4362-15663-0045 I SAW AND FELT STILL MORE OF THE SHASTA SNOW FOR THEN IT WAS MY FORTUNE TO GET INTO THE VERY HEART OF A STORM AND TO BE HELD IN IT FOR A LONG TIME ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE
4362-15663-0046 THE DAY INTERVENING BETWEEN THE TWO ASCENTS BEING DEVOTED TO ESTABLISHING A CAMP ON THE EXTREME EDGE OF THE TIMBERLINE HERE ON OUR RED TRACHYTE BED WE OBTAINED TWO HOURS OF SHALLOW SLEEP BROKEN FOR OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES OF THE KEEN STARRY NIGHT
4362-15663-0047 AT TWO O'CLOCK WE ROSE BREAKFASTED ON A WARMED TIN CUPFUL OF COFFEE AND A PIECE OF FROZEN VENISON BROILED ON THE COALS AND STARTED FOR THE SUMMIT UP TO THIS TIME THERE WAS NOTHING IN SIGHT THAT BETOKENED THE APPROACH OF A STORM
4362-15663-0048 BUT ON GAINING THE SUMMIT WE SAW TOWARD LASSEN'S BUTTE HUNDREDS OF SQUARE MILES OF WHITE CUMULI BOILING DREAMILY IN THE SUNSHINE FAR BENEATH US AND CAUSING NO ALARM THE SLIGHT WEARINESS OF THE ASCENT WAS SOON RESTED AWAY
4362-15663-0049 AND OUR GLORIOUS MORNING IN THE SKY PROMISED NOTHING BUT ENJOYMENT AT NINE A M THE DRY THERMOMETER STOOD AT THIRTY FOUR DEGREES IN THE SHADE AND ROSE STEADILY UNTIL AT ONE P M IT STOOD AT FIFTY DEGREES
4362-15663-0050 PROBABLY INFLUENCED SOMEWHAT BY RADIATION FROM THE SUN WARMED CLIFFS A COMMON BUMBLEBEE NOT AT ALL BENUMBED ZIGZAGGED VIGOROUSLY ABOUT OUR HEADS FOR A FEW MOMENTS AS IF UNCONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT THE NEAREST HONEY FLOWER WAS A MILE BENEATH HIM
4362-15663-0051 IN THE MEAN TIME CLOUDS WERE GROWING DOWN IN SHASTA VALLEY MASSIVE SWELLING CUMULI DISPLAYING DELICIOUS TONES OF PURPLE AND GRAY IN THE HOLLOWS OF THEIR SUN BEATEN BOSSES EXTENDING GRADUALLY SOUTHWARD AROUND ON BOTH SIDES OF SHASTA
4362-15663-0052 THESE AT LENGTH UNITED WITH THE OLDER FIELD TOWARDS LASSEN'S BUTTE THUS ENCIRCLING MOUNT SHASTA IN ONE CONTINUOUS CLOUD ZONE RHETT AND KLAMATH LAKES WERE ECLIPSED BENEATH CLOUDS SCARCELY LESS BRILLIANT THAN THEIR OWN SILVERY DISKS
4362-15663-0053 THE MODOC LAVA BEDS MANY A SNOW LADEN PEAK FAR NORTH IN OREGON THE SCOTT AND TRINITY AND SISKIYOU MOUNTAINS THE PEAKS OF THE SIERRA THE BLUE COAST RANGE SHASTA VALLEY THE DARK FORESTS FILLING THE VALLEY OF THE SACRAMENTO
4362-15663-0054 THE CREATIVE SUN SHONE GLORIOUS ON THE VAST EXPANSE OF CLOUDLAND HILL AND DALE MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY SPRINGING INTO EXISTENCE RESPONSIVE TO HIS RAYS AND STEADILY DEVELOPING IN BEAUTY AND INDIVIDUALITY
4362-15663-0055 ON THE CONTRARY THEY IMPRESSED ONE AS BEING LASTING ADDITIONS TO THE LANDSCAPE THE WEATHER OF THE SPRINGTIME AND SUMMER THROUGHOUT THE SIERRA IN GENERAL IS USUALLY VARIED BY SLIGHT LOCAL RAINS AND DUSTINGS OF SNOW
4362-15663-0056 MOST OF WHICH ARE OBVIOUSLY FAR TOO JOYOUS AND LIFE GIVING TO BE REGARDED AS STORMS SINGLE CLOUDS GROWING IN THE SUNNY SKY RIPENING IN AN HOUR SHOWERING THE HEATED LANDSCAPE AND PASSING AWAY LIKE A THOUGHT
4362-15663-0057 ASSUMING A VIOLENCE AND ENERGY OF EXPRESSION SCARCELY SURPASSED BY THOSE BRED IN THE DEPTHS OF WINTER SUCH WAS THE STORM NOW GATHERING ABOUT US IT BEGAN TO DECLARE ITSELF SHORTLY AFTER NOON
4362-15663-0058 SUGGESTING TO US THE IDEA OF AT ONCE SEEKING OUR SAFE CAMP IN THE TIMBER AND ABANDONING THE PURPOSE OF MAKING AN OBSERVATION OF THE BAROMETER AT THREE P M TWO HAVING ALREADY BEEN MADE
4362-15663-0059 WHILE SIMULTANEOUS OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE AT STRAWBERRY VALLEY JEROME PEERED AT SHORT INTERVALS OVER THE RIDGE CONTEMPLATING THE RISING CLOUDS WITH ANXIOUS GESTURES IN THE ROUGH WIND AND AT LENGTH DECLARED THAT IF WE DID NOT MAKE A SPEEDY ESCAPE
4362-15663-0060 WE SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO PASS THE REST OF THE DAY AND NIGHT ON THE SUMMIT BUT ANXIETY TO COMPLETE MY OBSERVATIONS STIFLED MY OWN INSTINCTIVE PROMPTINGS TO RETREAT AND HELD ME TO MY WORK NO INEXPERIENCED PERSON WAS DEPENDING ON ME
4362-15663-0061 AND I TOLD JEROME THAT WE TWO MOUNTAINEERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE OUR WAY DOWN THROUGH ANY STORM LIKELY TO FALL PRESENTLY THIN FIBROUS FILMS OF CLOUD BEGAN TO BLOW DIRECTLY OVER THE SUMMIT FROM NORTH TO SOUTH
4362-15663-0062 DRAWN OUT IN LONG FAIRY WEBS LIKE CARDED WOOL FORMING AND DISSOLVING AS IF BY MAGIC THE WIND TWISTED THEM INTO RINGLETS AND WHIRLED THEM IN A SUCCESSION OF GRACEFUL CONVOLUTIONS LIKE THE OUTSIDE SPRAYS OF YOSEMITE FALLS IN FLOOD TIME
4362-15663-0063 THEN SAILING OUT INTO THE THIN AZURE OVER THE PRECIPITOUS BRINK OF THE RIDGE THEY WERE DRIFTED TOGETHER LIKE WREATHS OF FOAM ON A RIVER THESE HIGHER AND FINER CLOUD FABRICS
4362-15663-0064 ILL DEFINED EMBANKMENT FROM THE ICY MESHES OF WHICH SNOW FLOWERS BEGAN TO FALL ALTERNATING WITH HAIL THE SKY SPEEDILY DARKENED AND JUST AS I HAD COMPLETED MY LAST OBSERVATION AND BOXED MY INSTRUMENTS READY FOR THE DESCENT
4362-15663-0065 THE STORM BEGAN IN SERIOUS EARNEST AT FIRST THE CLIFFS WERE BEATEN WITH HAIL EVERY STONE OF WHICH AS FAR AS I COULD SEE WAS REGULAR IN FORM SIX SIDED PYRAMIDS WITH ROUNDED BASE RICH AND SUMPTUOUS LOOKING AND FASHIONED WITH LOVING CARE
4362-15663-0066 YET SEEMINGLY THROWN AWAY ON THOSE DESOLATE CRAGS DOWN WHICH THEY WENT ROLLING FALLING SLIDING IN A NETWORK OF CURIOUS STREAMS AFTER WE HAD FORCED OUR WAY DOWN THE RIDGE AND PAST THE GROUP OF HISSING FUMAROLES
4362-15663-0067 THE STORM BECAME INCONCEIVABLY VIOLENT THE THERMOMETER FELL TWENTY TWO DEGREES IN A FEW MINUTES AND SOON DROPPED BELOW ZERO THE HAIL GAVE PLACE TO SNOW AND DARKNESS CAME ON LIKE NIGHT THE WIND RISING TO THE HIGHEST PITCH OF VIOLENCE
4362-15663-0068 BOOMED AND SURGED AMID THE DESOLATE CRAGS LIGHTNING FLASHES IN QUICK SUCCESSION CUT THE GLOOMY DARKNESS AND THE THUNDERS THE MOST TREMENDOUSLY LOUD AND APPALLING I EVER HEARD MADE AN ALMOST CONTINUOUS ROAR
4362-15663-0069 STROKE FOLLOWING STROKE IN QUICK PASSIONATE SUCCESSION AS THOUGH THE MOUNTAIN WERE BEING RENT TO ITS FOUNDATIONS AND THE FIRES OF THE OLD VOLCANO WERE BREAKING FORTH AGAIN COULD WE AT ONCE HAVE BEGUN TO DESCEND THE SNOW SLOPES LEADING TO THE TIMBER
4362-15663-0070 WE MIGHT HAVE MADE GOOD OUR ESCAPE HOWEVER DARK AND WILD THE STORM AS IT WAS WE HAD FIRST TO MAKE OUR WAY ALONG A DANGEROUS RIDGE NEARLY A MILE AND A HALF LONG FLANKED IN MANY PLACES BY STEEP ICE SLOPES AT THE HEAD OF THE WHITNEY GLACIER ON ONE SIDE
4362-15663-0071 TO LET JEROME WHO HAD FALLEN A LITTLE BEHIND COME UP HERE HE OPENED A COUNCIL IN WHICH UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EXCITING BUT WITHOUT EVINCING ANY BEWILDERMENT HE MAINTAINED IN OPPOSITION TO MY VIEWS THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCEED
4362-15663-0072 HE FIRMLY REFUSED TO MAKE THE VENTURE TO FIND THE CAMP WHILE I AWARE OF THE DANGERS THAT WOULD NECESSARILY ATTEND OUR EFFORTS AND CONSCIOUS OF BEING THE CAUSE OF HIS PRESENT PERIL DECIDED NOT TO LEAVE HIM OUR DISCUSSIONS ENDED
4362-15663-0073 JEROME MADE A DASH FROM THE SHELTER OF THE LAVA BLOCK AND BEGAN FORCING HIS WAY BACK AGAINST THE WIND TO THE HOT SPRINGS WAVERING AND STRUGGLING TO RESIST BEING CARRIED AWAY AS IF HE WERE FORDING A RAPID STREAM
4362-15663-0074 AFTER WAITING AND WATCHING IN VAIN FOR SOME FLAW IN THE STORM THAT MIGHT BE URGED AS A NEW ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF ATTEMPTING THE DESCENT I WAS COMPELLED TO FOLLOW HERE SAID JEROME AS WE SHIVERED IN THE MIDST OF THE HISSING SPUTTERING FUMAROLES
4362-15663-0075 EVEN AFTER THE STORM IS OVER WE SHALL HAVE TO WAIT FOR SUNSHINE AND WHEN WILL IT COME THE TEMPERED AREA TO WHICH WE HAD COMMITTED OURSELVES EXTENDED OVER ABOUT ONE FOURTH OF AN ACRE
4362-15663-0076 BUT IT WAS ONLY ABOUT AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH IN THICKNESS FOR THE SCALDING GAS JETS WERE SHORN OFF CLOSE TO THE GROUND BY THE OVERSWEEPING FLOOD OF FROSTY WIND AND HOW LAVISHLY THE SNOW FELL ONLY MOUNTAINEERS MAY KNOW THE CRISP CRYSTAL FLOWERS
4362-15663-0077 SEEMED TO TOUCH ONE ANOTHER AND FAIRLY TO THICKEN THE TREMENDOUS BLAST THAT CARRIED THEM THIS WAS THE BLOOM TIME THE SUMMER OF THE CLOUD AND NEVER BEFORE HAVE I SEEN EVEN A MOUNTAIN CLOUD FLOWERING SO PROFUSELY
4362-15663-0078 WHEN THE BLOOM OF THE SHASTA CHAPARRAL IS FALLING THE GROUND IS SOMETIMES COVERED FOR HUNDREDS OF SQUARE MILES TO A DEPTH OF HALF AN INCH BUT THE BLOOM OF THIS FERTILE SNOW CLOUD GREW AND MATURED AND FELL TO A DEPTH OF TWO FEET IN A FEW HOURS
4362-15663-0079 SOME CRYSTALS LANDED WITH THEIR RAYS ALMOST PERFECT BUT MOST OF THEM WERE WORN AND BROKEN BY STRIKING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER OR BY ROLLING ON THE GROUND THE TOUCH OF THESE SNOW FLOWERS IN CALM WEATHER IS INFINITELY GENTLE GLINTING SWAYING
4362-15663-0080 SETTLING SILENTLY IN THE DRY MOUNTAIN AIR OR MASSED IN FLAKES SOFT AND DOWNY TO LIE OUT ALONE IN THE MOUNTAINS OF A STILL NIGHT AND BE TOUCHED BY THE FIRST OF THESE SMALL SILENT MESSENGERS FROM THE SKY IS A MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE
4362-15663-0081 AND THE FINENESS OF THAT TOUCH NONE WILL FORGET BUT THE STORM BLAST LADEN WITH CRISP SHARP SNOW SEEMS TO CRUSH AND BRUISE AND STUPEFY WITH ITS MULTITUDE OF STINGS AND COMPELS THE BRAVEST TO TURN AND FLEE
4362-15663-0082 A WEAVING OF TRANSLUCENT TISSUE ABOVE THEN THE ROAR OF THE WIND AND THE THUNDER AND THE DARKENING FLIGHT OF SNOW ITS SUBSIDENCE WAS NOT LESS SUDDEN THE CLOUDS BROKE AND VANISHED NOT A CRYSTAL WAS LEFT IN THE SKY
4362-15663-0083 AND IN MANY PLACES REACHED THE SKIN WE WERE GLAD AT FIRST TO SEE THE SNOW PACKING ABOUT US HOPING IT WOULD DEADEN THE FORCE OF THE WIND BUT IT SOON FROZE INTO A STIFF CRUSTY HEAP AS THE TEMPERATURE FELL RATHER AUGMENTING OUR NOVEL MISERY
4362-15663-0084 IN OUR FROZEN AND BROILED CONDITION SEEMED CERTAIN DEATH THE ACRID INCRUSTATIONS SUBLIMED FROM THE ESCAPING GASES FREQUENTLY GAVE WAY OPENING NEW VENTS TO SCALD US AND FEARING THAT IF AT ANY TIME THE WIND SHOULD FALL
4362-15663-0085 MIGHT COLLECT IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES TO CAUSE SLEEP AND DEATH
4362-15663-0086 EVEN SHOULD HIS SUFFERINGS ADMIT OF SUCH A THING ACCORDINGLY WHEN DURING THE LONG DREARY WATCHES OF THE NIGHT WE ROUSED FROM A STATE OF HALF CONSCIOUSNESS WE CALLED EACH OTHER BY NAME IN A FRIGHTENED STARTLED WAY
4362-15663-0087 EACH FEARING THE OTHER MIGHT BE BENUMBED OR DEAD THE ORDINARY SENSATIONS OF COLD GIVE BUT A FAINT CONCEPTION OF THAT WHICH COMES ON AFTER HARD CLIMBING WITH WANT OF FOOD AND SLEEP IN SUCH EXPOSURE AS THIS LIFE IS THEN SEEN TO BE A FIRE
4362-15663-0088 THAT NOW SMOULDERS NOW BRIGHTENS AND MAY BE EASILY QUENCHED THE WEARY HOURS WORE AWAY LIKE DIM HALF FORGOTTEN YEARS SO LONG AND EVENTFUL THEY SEEMED THOUGH WE DID NOTHING BUT SUFFER
4362-15663-0089 STILL THE PAIN WAS NOT ALWAYS OF THAT BITTER INTENSE KIND THAT PRECLUDES THOUGHT AND TAKES AWAY ALL CAPACITY FOR ENJOYMENT A SORT OF DREAMY STUPOR CAME ON AT TIMES
4362-15663-0090 IN WHICH WE FANCIED WE SAW DRY RESINOUS LOGS SUITABLE FOR CAMPFIRES JUST AS AFTER GOING DAYS WITHOUT FOOD MEN FANCY THEY SEE BREAD FROZEN BLISTERED FAMISHED BENUMBED OUR BODIES SEEMED LOST TO US AT TIMES
4362-15663-0091 SHINING WITH MARVELOUS BRIGHTNESS WITH LONG LANCE RAYS NEAR LOOKING AND NEW LOOKING AS IF NEVER SEEN BEFORE AGAIN THEY WOULD LOOK FAMILIAR AND REMIND US OF STARGAZING AT HOME OFTENTIMES IMAGINATION COMING INTO PLAY
4362-15663-0092 THE FROST GREW MORE AND MORE INTENSE AND WE BECAME ICY AND COVERED OVER WITH A CRUST OF FROZEN SNOW
4362-15663-0093 IN ABOUT THIRTEEN HOURS EVERY HOUR LIKE A YEAR DAY BEGAN TO DAWN BUT IT WAS LONG ERE THE SUMMIT'S ROCKS WERE TOUCHED BY THE SUN NO CLOUDS WERE VISIBLE FROM WHERE WE LAY YET THE MORNING WAS DULL AND BLUE AND BITTERLY FROSTY
4362-15663-0094 AND HOUR AFTER HOUR PASSED BY WHILE WE EAGERLY WATCHED THE PALE LIGHT STEALING DOWN THE RIDGE TO THE HOLLOW WHERE WE LAY BUT THERE WAS NOT A TRACE OF THAT WARM FLUSHING SUNRISE SPLENDOR WE SO LONG HAD HOPED FOR
4362-15663-0095 AS THE TIME DREW NEAR TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO REACH CAMP WE BECAME CONCERNED TO KNOW WHAT STRENGTH WAS LEFT US AND WHETHER OR NO WE COULD WALK FOR WE HAD LAIN FLAT ALL THIS TIME WITHOUT ONCE RISING TO OUR FEET
4362-15663-0096 MOUNTAINEERS HOWEVER ALWAYS FIND IN THEMSELVES A RESERVE OF POWER AFTER GREAT EXHAUSTION IT IS A KIND OF SECOND LIFE AVAILABLE ONLY IN EMERGENCIES LIKE THIS AND HAVING PROVED ITS EXISTENCE I HAD NO GREAT FEAR THAT EITHER OF US WOULD FAIL
4362-15663-0097 AT LENGTH AFTER THE TEMPERATURE WAS SOMEWHAT MITIGATED ON THIS MEMORABLE FIRST OF MAY WE AROSE AND BEGAN TO STRUGGLE HOMEWARD OUR FROZEN TROUSERS COULD SCARCELY BE MADE TO BEND AT THE KNEE AND WE WADED THE SNOW WITH DIFFICULTY
4362-15663-0098 THE SUMMIT RIDGE WAS FORTUNATELY WIND SWEPT AND NEARLY BARE SO WE WERE NOT COMPELLED TO LIFT OUR FEET HIGH AND ON REACHING THE LONG HOME SLOPES LADEN WITH LOOSE SNOW WE MADE RAPID PROGRESS SLIDING AND SHUFFLING AND PITCHING HEADLONG
4362-15663-0099 OUR FEEBLENESS ACCELERATING RATHER THAN DIMINISHING OUR SPEED WHEN WE HAD DESCENDED SOME THREE THOUSAND FEET THE SUNSHINE WARMED OUR BACKS AND WE BEGAN TO REVIVE AT TEN A M WE REACHED THE TIMBER AND WERE SAFE
4362-15663-0100 HALF AN HOUR LATER WE HEARD SISSON SHOUTING DOWN AMONG THE FIRS COMING WITH HORSES TO TAKE US TO THE HOTEL AFTER BREAKING A TRAIL THROUGH THE SNOW AS FAR AS POSSIBLE HE HAD TIED HIS ANIMALS AND WALKED UP WE HAD BEEN SO LONG WITHOUT FOOD
4362-15663-0101 THAT WE CARED BUT LITTLE ABOUT EATING BUT WE EAGERLY DRANK THE COFFEE HE PREPARED FOR US OUR FEET WERE FROZEN AND THAWING THEM WAS PAINFUL AND HAD TO BE DONE VERY SLOWLY BY KEEPING THEM BURIED IN SOFT SNOW FOR SEVERAL HOURS
4362-15663-0102 WHICH AVOIDED PERMANENT DAMAGE FIVE THOUSAND FEET BELOW THE SUMMIT WE FOUND ONLY THREE INCHES OF NEW SNOW AND AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN ONLY A SLIGHT SHOWER OF RAIN HAD FALLEN SHOWING HOW LOCAL OUR STORM HAD BEEN
4362-15663-0103 NOTWITHSTANDING ITS TERRIFIC FURY OUR FEET WERE WRAPPED IN SACKING AND WE WERE SOON MOUNTED AND ON OUR WAY DOWN INTO THE THICK SUNSHINE GOD'S COUNTRY AS SISSON CALLS THE CHAPARRAL ZONE
4362-15663-0104 HOW BEAUTIFUL SEEMED THE GOLDEN SUNBEAMS STREAMING THROUGH THE WOODS BETWEEN THE WARM BROWN BOLES OF THE CEDARS AND PINES ALL MY FRIENDS AMONG THE BIRDS AND PLANTS SEEMED LIKE OLD FRIENDS AND WE FELT LIKE SPEAKING TO EVERY ONE OF THEM AS WE PASSED
4362-15663-0105 AS IF WE HAD BEEN A LONG TIME AWAY IN SOME FAR STRANGE COUNTRY IN THE AFTERNOON WE REACHED STRAWBERRY VALLEY AND FELL ASLEEP NEXT MORNING WE SEEMED TO HAVE RISEN FROM THE DEAD MY BEDROOM WAS FLOODED WITH SUNSHINE
4362-15663-0106 AND FROM THE WINDOW I SAW THE GREAT WHITE SHASTA CONE CLAD IN FORESTS AND CLOUDS AND BEARING THEM LOFTILY IN THE SKY EVERYTHING SEEMED FULL AND RADIANT WITH THE FRESHNESS AND BEAUTY AND ENTHUSIASM OF YOUTH
4397-15666-0000 THE GREATER PORTION OF THE CALENDAR SPRINGTIME OF UTAH HAS BEEN WINTER IN ALL THE UPPER CANYONS OF THE MOUNTAINS THE SNOW IS NOW FROM FIVE TO TEN FEET DEEP OR MORE AND MOST OF IT HAS FALLEN SINCE MARCH
4397-15666-0001 ALMOST EVERY OTHER DAY DURING THE LAST THREE WEEKS SMALL LOCAL STORMS HAVE BEEN FALLING ON THE WAHSATCH AND OQUIRRH MOUNTAINS WHILE THE JORDAN VALLEY REMAINED DRY AND SUN FILLED BUT ON THE AFTERNOON OF THURSDAY THE SEVENTEENTH ULTIMO
4397-15666-0002 WIND RAIN AND SNOW FILLED THE WHOLE BASIN DRIVING WILDLY OVER VALLEY AND PLAIN FROM RANGE TO RANGE BESTOWING THEIR BENEFACTIONS IN MOST CORDIAL AND HARMONIOUS STORM MEASURES
4397-15666-0003 WITH BILLOWS OF DUST AND SAND
4397-15666-0004 THE BEGINNING OF THE OUTPOURING OF THE TREASURED WRATH OF THE LORD UPON THE GENTILES FOR THE KILLING OF JOSEPH SMITH TO ME IT SEEMED A CORDIAL OUTPOURING OF NATURE'S LOVE BUT IT IS EASY TO DIFFER WITH SALT LATTER DAYS IN EVERYTHING STORMS WIVES
4397-15666-0005 POLITICS AND RELIGION ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE THE STORM REACHED THE CITY I WAS SO FORTUNATE AS TO BE OUT WITH A FRIEND ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN ENJOYING THE SCENERY CLOUDS WITH PECULIARLY RESTLESS AND SELF CONSCIOUS GESTURES
4397-15666-0006 WERE MARSHALING THEMSELVES ALONG THE MOUNTAIN TOPS AND SENDING OUT LONG OVERLAPPING WINGS ACROSS THE VALLEY AND EVEN WHERE NO CLOUD WAS VISIBLE AN OBSCURING FILM ABSORBED THE SUNLIGHT GIVING RISE TO A COLD BLUISH DARKNESS NEVERTHELESS
4397-15666-0007 AND THEIR MARVELOUS PROFUSION OF ORNATE SCULPTURE WERE MOST IMPRESSIVELY MANIFEST ONE WOULD FANCY THAT A MAN MIGHT BE CLEARLY SEEN WALKING ON THE SNOW AT A DISTANCE OF TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES WHILE WE WERE REVELING IN THIS RARE UNGARISH GRANDEUR
4397-15666-0008 TURNING FROM RANGE TO RANGE STUDYING THE DARKENING SKY AND LISTENING TO THE STILL SMALL VOICES OF THE FLOWERS AT OUR FEET SOME OF THE DENSER CLOUDS CAME DOWN CROWNING AND WREATHING THE HIGHEST PEAKS AND DROPPING LONG GRAY FRINGES
4397-15666-0009 WHOSE SMOOTH LINEAR STRUCTURE SHOWED THAT SNOW WAS BEGINNING TO FALL OF THESE PARTIAL STORMS THERE WERE SOON TEN OR TWELVE ARRANGED IN TWO ROWS WHILE THE MAIN JORDAN VALLEY BETWEEN THEM LAY AS YET IN PROFOUND CALM AT FOUR THIRTY P M
4397-15666-0010 A DARK BROWNISH CLOUD APPEARED CLOSE DOWN ON THE PLAIN TOWARDS THE LAKE EXTENDING FROM THE NORTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE OQUIRRH RANGE IN A NORTHEASTERLY DIRECTION AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH ITS PECULIAR COLOR AND STRUCTURE
4397-15666-0011 EXCITED OUR ATTENTION WITHOUT ENABLING US TO DECIDE CERTAINLY AS TO ITS CHARACTER BUT WE WERE NOT LEFT LONG IN DOUBT FOR IN A FEW MINUTES IT CAME SWEEPING OVER THE VALLEY IN A WILD UPROAR A TORRENT OF WIND THICK WITH SAND AND DUST
4397-15666-0012 ADVANCING WITH A MOST MAJESTIC FRONT ROLLING AND OVERCOMBING LIKE A GIGANTIC SEA WAVE SCARCELY WAS IT IN PLAIN SIGHT ERE IT WAS UPON US RACING ACROSS THE JORDAN OVER THE CITY
4397-15666-0013 AND UP THE SLOPES OF THE WAHSATCH ECLIPSING ALL THE LANDSCAPES IN ITS COURSE THE BENDING TREES THE DUST STREAMERS AND THE WILD ONRUSH OF EVERYTHING MOVABLE GIVING IT AN APPRECIABLE VISIBILITY THAT RENDERED IT GRAND AND INSPIRING
4397-15666-0014 THE CRYSTAL FLAKES FALLING IN THE FOUL STREETS WAS A PITIFUL SIGHT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VAUNTED REFINING INFLUENCES OF TOWNS PURITY OF ALL KINDS PURE HEARTS PURE STREAMS PURE SNOW
4397-15666-0015 MUST HERE BE EXPOSED TO TERRIBLE TRIALS CITY CREEK COMING FROM ITS HIGH GLACIAL FOUNTAINS ENTERS THE STREETS OF THIS MORMON ZION PURE AS AN ANGEL BUT HOW DOES IT LEAVE IT
4397-15666-0016 EVEN ROSES AND LILIES IN GARDENS MOST LOVED ARE TAINTED WITH A THOUSAND IMPURITIES AS SOON AS THEY UNFOLD I HEARD BRIGHAM YOUNG IN THE TABERNACLE THE OTHER DAY WARNING HIS PEOPLE THAT IF THEY DID NOT MEND THEIR MANNERS ANGELS WOULD NOT COME INTO THEIR HOUSES
4397-15666-0017 THOUGH PERCHANCE THEY MIGHT BE SAUNTERING BY WITH LITTLE ELSE TO DO THAN CHAT WITH THEM POSSIBLY THERE MAY BE SALT LAKE FAMILIES SUFFICIENTLY PURE FOR ANGEL SOCIETY BUT I WAS NOT PLEASED WITH THE RECEPTION THEY GAVE THE SMALL SNOW ANGELS THAT GOD SENT AMONG THEM THE OTHER NIGHT
4397-15666-0018 ONLY THE CHILDREN HAILED THEM WITH DELIGHT THE OLD LATTER DAYS SEEMED TO SHUN THEM I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW MISTER YOUNG THE LAKE PROPHET WOULD MEET SUCH MESSENGERS BUT TO RETURN TO THE STORM
4397-15666-0019 TOWARD THE EVENING OF THE EIGHTEENTH IT BEGAN TO WITHER THE SNOWY SKIRTS OF THE WAHSATCH MOUNTAINS APPEARED BENEATH THE LIFTING FRINGES OF THE CLOUDS AND THE SUN SHONE OUT THROUGH COLORED WINDOWS PRODUCING ONE OF THE MOST GLORIOUS AFTER STORM EFFECTS I EVER WITNESSED
4397-15666-0020 LOOKING ACROSS THE JORDAN THE GRAY SAGEY SLOPES FROM THE BASE OF THE OQUIRRH MOUNTAINS WERE COVERED WITH A THICK PLUSHY CLOTH OF GOLD SOFT AND ETHEREAL AS A CLOUD NOT MERELY TINTED AND GILDED LIKE A ROCK WITH AUTUMN SUNSHINE BUT DEEPLY MUFFLED BEYOND RECOGNITION
4397-15666-0021 SURELY NOTHING IN HEAVEN NOR ANY MANSION OF THE LORD IN ALL HIS WORLDS COULD BE MORE GLORIOUSLY CARPETED OTHER PORTIONS OF THE PLAIN WERE FLUSHED WITH RED AND PURPLE AND ALL THE MOUNTAINS AND THE CLOUDS ABOVE THEM WERE PAINTED IN CORRESPONDING LOVELINESS
4397-15666-0022 EARTH AND SKY ROUND AND ROUND THE ENTIRE LANDSCAPE WAS ONE RAVISHING REVELATION OF COLOR INFINITELY VARIED AND INTERBLENDED I HAVE SEEN MANY A GLORIOUS SUNSET BENEATH LIFTING STORM CLOUDS ON THE MOUNTAINS
4397-15666-0023 BUT NOTHING COMPARABLE WITH THIS I FELT AS IF NEW ARRIVED IN SOME OTHER FAR OFF WORLD THE MOUNTAINS THE PLAINS THE SKY ALL SEEMED NEW OTHER EXPERIENCES SEEMED BUT TO HAVE PREPARED ME FOR THIS AS SOULS ARE PREPARED FOR HEAVEN
4397-15666-0024 TRAILED THEIR LUSTROUS FRINGES THROUGH THE PINES AS IF TAKING A LAST VIEW OF THEIR ACCOMPLISHED WORK THEN CAME DARKNESS AND THE GLORIOUS DAY WAS DONE
4397-15666-0025 THEY ARE COVERED WITH COMMON SUNSHINE DOWN HERE ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN LARKS AND REDWINGS ARE SWINGING ON THE RUSHES THE BALMY AIR IS INSTINCT WITH IMMORTAL LIFE THE WILD FLOWERS THE GRASS
4397-15666-0026 AND THE FARMERS GRAIN ARE FRESH AS IF LIKE THE SNOW THEY HAD COME OUT OF HEAVEN
4397-15668-0000 YOU MAY WALK THE DESERTS OF THE GREAT BASIN IN THE BLOOM TIME OF THE YEAR ALL THE WAY ACROSS FROM THE SNOWY SIERRA TO THE SNOWY WAHSATCH AND YOUR EYES WILL BE FILLED WITH MANY A GAY MALVA AND POPPY AND ABRONIA AND CACTUS
4397-15668-0001 BUT YOU MAY NOT SEE A SINGLE TRUE LILY AND ONLY A VERY FEW LILIACEOUS PLANTS OF ANY KIND NOT EVEN IN THE COOL FRESH GLENS OF THE MOUNTAINS WILL YOU FIND THESE FAVORITE FLOWERS THOUGH SOME OF THESE DESERT RANGES ALMOST RIVAL THE SIERRA IN HEIGHT
4397-15668-0002 NEVERTHELESS IN THE BUILDING AND PLANTING OF THIS GRAND TERRITORY THE LILIES WERE NOT FORGOTTEN FAR BACK IN THE DIM GEOLOGIC AGES WHEN THE SEDIMENTS OF THE OLD SEAS WERE BEING GATHERED AND OUTSPREAD IN SMOOTH SHEETS LIKE LEAVES OF A BOOK
4397-15668-0003 AND WHEN THESE SEDIMENTS BECAME DRY LAND AND WERE BAKED AND CRUMBLED INTO THE SKY AS MOUNTAIN RANGES WHEN THE LAVA FLOODS OF THE FIRE PERIOD WERE BEING LAVISHLY POURED FORTH FROM INNUMERABLE RIFTS AND CRATERS
4397-15668-0004 WHEN THE ICE OF THE GLACIAL PERIOD WAS LAID LIKE A MANTLE OVER EVERY MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY THROUGHOUT ALL THESE IMMENSELY PROTRACTED PERIODS IN THE THRONG OF THESE MAJESTIC OPERATIONS NATURE KEPT HER FLOWER CHILDREN IN MIND SHE CONSIDERED THE LILIES
4397-15668-0005 AND WHILE PLANTING THE PLAINS WITH SAGE AND THE HILLS WITH CEDAR SHE HAS COVERED AT LEAST ONE MOUNTAIN WITH GOLDEN ERYTHRONIUMS AND FRITILLARIAS AS ITS CROWNING GLORY AS IF WILLING TO SHOW WHAT SHE COULD DO IN THE LILY LINE EVEN HERE
4397-15668-0006 LOOKING SOUTHWARD FROM THE SOUTH END OF SALT LAKE THE TWO NORTHMOST PEAKS OF THE OQUIRRH RANGE ARE SEEN SWELLING CALMLY INTO THE COOL SKY WITHOUT ANY MARKED CHARACTER EXCEPTING ONLY THEIR SNOW CROWNS
4397-15668-0007 AND A FEW WEEDY LOOKING PATCHES OF SPRUCE AND FIR THE SIMPLICITY OF THEIR SLOPES PREVENTING THEIR REAL LOFTINESS FROM BEING APPRECIATED GRAY SAGEY PLAINS CIRCLE AROUND THEIR BASES AND UP TO A HEIGHT OF A THOUSAND FEET OR MORE THEIR SIDES ARE TINGED WITH PURPLE
4397-15668-0008 AND OVER ALL THE SMOOTH CROWN OF SNOW WHILE STANDING AT THEIR FEET THE OTHER DAY SHORTLY AFTER MY MEMORABLE EXCURSION AMONG THE SALT WAVES OF THE LAKE I SAID NOW I SHALL HAVE ANOTHER BAPTISM
4397-15668-0009 I WILL BATHE IN THE HIGH SKY AMONG COOL WIND WAVES FROM THE SNOW FROM THE MORE SOUTHERLY OF THE TWO PEAKS A LONG RIDGE COMES DOWN BENT LIKE A BOW ONE END IN THE HOT PLAINS THE OTHER IN THE SNOW OF THE SUMMIT
4397-15668-0010 AFTER CAREFULLY SCANNING THE JAGGED TOWERS AND BATTLEMENTS WITH WHICH IT IS ROUGHENED I DETERMINED TO MAKE IT MY WAY THOUGH IT PRESENTED BUT A FEEBLE ADVERTISEMENT OF ITS FLORAL WEALTH THIS APPARENT BARRENNESS HOWEVER MADE NO GREAT OBJECTION JUST THEN
4397-15668-0011 I WAS ANIMATED BY A MOUNTAINEER'S EAGERNESS TO GET MY FEET INTO THE SNOW ONCE MORE AND MY HEAD INTO THE CLEAR SKY AFTER LYING DORMANT ALL WINTER AT THE LEVEL OF THE SEA BUT IN EVERY WALK WITH NATURE ONE RECEIVES FAR MORE THAN HE SEEKS
4397-15668-0012 I HAD NOT GONE MORE THAN A MILE FROM LAKE POINT ERE I FOUND THE WAY PROFUSELY DECKED WITH FLOWERS MOSTLY COMPOSITAE AND PURPLE LEGUMINOSAE A HUNDRED COROLLAS OR MORE TO THE SQUARE YARD WITH A CORRESPONDING ABUNDANCE OF WINGED BLOSSOMS ABOVE THEM MOTHS AND BUTTERFLIES
4397-15668-0013 TWO LILIACEOUS PLANTS IN PARTICULAR ERYTHRONIUM GRANDIFLORUM AND FRITILLARIA PUDICA ARE MARVELOUSLY BEAUTIFUL AND ABUNDANT
4397-15668-0014 NEVER BEFORE IN ALL MY WALKS HAVE I MET SO GLORIOUS A THRONG OF THESE FINE SHOWY LILIACEOUS PLANTS THE WHOLE MOUNTAINSIDE WAS AGLOW WITH THEM FROM A HEIGHT OF FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED FEET TO THE VERY EDGE OF THE SNOW
4397-15668-0015 ON THE UPPER SIDE WHERE THE BUSHES WERE MORE OPEN BUT A COMPANY COMPOSED OF THE TWO LILIES I HAVE MENTIONED WERE BLOOMING ON THE LOWER SIDE AND THOUGH THEY WERE AS YET OUT OF SIGHT I SUDDENLY CHANGED MY MIND AND WENT DOWN TO MEET THEM
4397-15668-0016 AS IF ATTRACTED BY THE RINGING OF THEIR BELLS THEY WERE GROWING IN A SMALL NESTLIKE OPENING BETWEEN THE ROCK AND THE BUSHES AND BOTH THE ERYTHRONIUM AND THE FRITILLARIA WERE IN FULL FLOWER THESE WERE THE FIRST OF THE SPECIES I HAD SEEN
4397-15668-0017 AND I NEED NOT TRY TO TELL THE JOY THEY MADE THEY ARE BOTH LOWLY PLANTS LOWLY AS VIOLETS THE TALLEST SELDOM EXCEEDING SIX INCHES IN HEIGHT SO THAT THE MOST SEARCHING WINDS THAT SWEEP THE MOUNTAINS SCARCE REACH LOW ENOUGH TO SHAKE THEIR BELLS
4397-15668-0018 THE PETALS BEING STRONGLY RECURVED LIKE THOSE OF LILIUM SUPERBUM OCCASIONALLY A SPECIMEN IS MET WHICH HAS FROM TWO TO FIVE FLOWERS HUNG IN A LOOSE PANICLE PEOPLE OFTENTIMES TRAVEL FAR TO SEE CURIOUS PLANTS LIKE THE CARNIVOROUS DARLINGTONIA
4397-15668-0019 THE FLY CATCHER THE WALKING FERN ET CETERA I HARDLY KNOW HOW THE LITTLE BELLS I HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING WOULD BE REGARDED BY SEEKERS OF THIS CLASS BUT EVERY TRUE FLOWER LOVER WHO COMES TO CONSIDER THESE UTAH LILIES WILL SURELY BE WELL REWARDED HOWEVER LONG THE WAY
4397-15668-0020 PUSHING ON UP THE RUGGED SLOPES I FOUND MANY DELIGHTFUL SECLUSIONS MOIST NOOKS AT THE FOOT OF CLIFFS AND LILIES IN EVERY ONE OF THEM NOT GROWING CLOSE TOGETHER LIKE DAISIES BUT WELL APART WITH PLENTY OF ROOM FOR THEIR BELLS TO SWING FREE AND RING
4397-15668-0021 I FOUND HUNDREDS OF THEM IN FULL BLOOM WITHIN TWO FEET OF THE SNOW IN WINTER ONLY THE BULBS ARE ALIVE SLEEPING DEEP BENEATH THE GROUND LIKE FIELD MICE IN THEIR NESTS THEN THE SNOW FLOWERS FALL ABOVE THEM LILIES OVER LILIES
4397-15668-0022 UNTIL THE SPRING WINDS BLOW AND THESE WINTER LILIES WITHER IN TURN THEN THE HIDING ERYTHRONIUMS AND FRITILLARIAS RISE AGAIN RESPONSIVE TO THE FIRST TOUCHES OF THE SUN I NOTICED THE TRACKS OF DEER IN MANY PLACES AMONG THE LILY GARDENS
4397-15668-0023 AND AT THE HEIGHT OF ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND FEET I CAME UPON THE FRESH TRAIL OF A FLOCK OF WILD SHEEP SHOWING THAT THESE FINE MOUNTAINEERS STILL FLOURISH HERE ABOVE THE RANGE OF MORMON RIFLES IN THE PLANTING OF HER WILD GARDENS
4397-15668-0024 NATURE TAKES THE FEET AND TEETH OF HER FLOCKS INTO ACCOUNT AND MAKES USE OF THEM TO TRIM AND CULTIVATE AND KEEP THEM IN ORDER AS THE BARK AND BUDS OF THE TREE ARE TENDED BY WOODPECKERS AND LINNETS THE EVERGREEN WOODS CONSIST AS FAR AS I OBSERVED OF TWO SPECIES
4397-15668-0025 A SPRUCE AND A FIR STANDING CLOSE TOGETHER ERECT AND ARROWY IN A THRIFTY COMPACT GROWTH BUT THEY ARE QUITE SMALL SAY FROM SIX TO TWELVE OR FOURTEEN INCHES IN DIAMETER AND BOUT FORTY FEET IN HEIGHT AMONG THEIR GIANT RELATIVES OF THE SIERRA
4397-15668-0026 SNOWY ICE SCULPTURED RANGES BOUNDED THE HORIZON ALL AROUND WHILE THE GREAT LAKE EIGHTY MILES LONG AND FIFTY MILES WIDE LAY FULLY REVEALED BENEATH A LILY SKY
4397-15668-0027 AND THE WIDE PRAIRIE OF WATER GLOWING IN THE GOLD AND PURPLE OF EVENING PRESENTED ALL THE COLORS THAT TINT THE LIPS OF SHELLS AND THE PETALS OF LILIES THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LAKE THIS SIDE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS UTAH LAKE
4397-15668-0028 LYING THIRTY FIVE MILES TO THE SOUTH WAS IN FULL SIGHT ALSO AND THE RIVER JORDAN WHICH LINKS THE TWO TOGETHER MAY BE TRACED IN SILVERY GLEAMS THROUGHOUT ITS WHOLE COURSE
4397-15668-0029 THE GRANDEST I HAD CARRIED IN MANY A DAY I REACHED THE HOTEL ON THE LAKE ABOUT DUSK WITH ALL MY FRESH RICHES AND MY FIRST MOUNTAIN RAMBLE IN UTAH WAS ACCOMPLISHED ON MY WAY BACK TO THE CITY THE NEXT DAY
4397-15668-0030 I SHOOK MY BIG HANDFUL OF LILIES IN HIS FACE AND SHOUTED HERE ARE THE TRUE SAINTS ANCIENT AND LATTER DAY ENDURING FOREVER
4397-15668-0031 HE SAID THEY ARE NICE
4397-15668-0032 ARE TWO SPECIES OF ZIGADENAS FRITILLARIA ATROPURPUREA
4397-15668-0033 AND THREE OR FOUR HANDSOME ALLIUMS ONE OF THESE LILIES THE CALOCHORTUS SEVERAL SPECIES OF WHICH ARE WELL KNOWN IN CALIFORNIA AS THE MARIPOSA TULIPS HAS RECEIVED GREAT CONSIDERATION AT THE HANDS OF THE MORMONS
4397-15668-0034 FOR TO IT HUNDREDS OF THEM OWE THEIR LIVES DURING THE FAMINE YEARS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE AND EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT GREAT DESTITUTION PREVAILED ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHERN SETTLEMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF DROUTH AND GRASSHOPPERS
4397-15668-0035 AND THROUGHOUT ONE HUNGRY WINTER IN PARTICULAR THOUSANDS OF THE PEOPLE SUBSISTED CHIEFLY ON THE BULBS OF THE TULIPS CALLED SEGO BY THE INDIANS WHO TAUGHT THEM ITS USE LILIACEOUS WOMEN AND GIRLS ARE RARE AMONG THE MORMONS
4397-15668-0036 OFTEN CURIOUSLY FRECKLED LIKE THE PETALS OF FRITILLARIA ATROPURPUREA THEY ARE FRUIT RATHER THAN FLOWER GOOD BROWN BREAD BUT DOWN IN THE SAN PITCH VALLEY AT GUNNISON I DISCOVERED A GENUINE LILY HAPPILY NAMED LILY YOUNG
4397-15668-0037 SHE IS A GRANDDAUGHTER OF BRIGHAM YOUNG SLENDER AND GRACEFUL WITH LILY WHITE CHEEKS TINTED WITH CLEAR ROSE SHE WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE OLD SALT LAKE ZION HOUSE BUT BY SOME STRANGE CHANCE
4397-15668-0038 HAS BEEN TRANSPLANTED TO THIS WILDERNESS WHERE SHE BLOOMS ALONE THE LILY OF SAN PITCH PITCH IS AN OLD INDIAN WHO I SUPPOSE PITCHED INTO THE SETTLERS AND THUS ACQUIRED FAME ENOUGH TO GIVE NAME TO THE VALLEY
4397-15668-0039 HERE I FEEL UNEASY ABOUT THE NAME OF THIS LILY FOR THE COMPOSITORS HAVE A PERVERSE TRICK OF MAKING ME SAY ALL KINDS OF ABSURD THINGS WHOLLY UNWARRANTED BY PLAIN COPY AND I FEAR THAT THE LILY OF SAN PITCH WILL APPEAR IN PRINT AS THE WIDOW OF SAM PATCH
4397-15678-0000 AS ONE STROLLS IN THE WOODS ABOUT THE LOGGING CAMPS MOST OF THE LUMBERMEN ARE FOUND TO BE INTERESTING PEOPLE TO MEET KIND AND OBLIGING AND SINCERE FULL OF KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING THE BARK AND SAPWOOD AND HEARTWOOD OF THE TREES THEY CUT AND HOW TO FELL THEM WITHOUT UNNECESSARY BREAKAGE
4397-15678-0001 A VERY DIFFERENT MAN SEEN NOW AND THEN AT LONG INTERVALS BUT USUALLY INVISIBLE IS THE FREE ROAMER OF THE WILDERNESS HUNTER PROSPECTOR EXPLORER SEEKING HE KNOWS NOT WHAT LITHE AND SINEWY HE WALKS ERECT
4397-15678-0002 MAKING HIS WAY WITH THE SKILL OF WILD ANIMALS ALL HIS SENSES IN ACTION WATCHFUL AND ALERT LOOKING KEENLY AT EVERYTHING IN SIGHT HIS IMAGINATION WELL NOURISHED IN THE WEALTH OF THE WILDERNESS COMING INTO CONTACT WITH FREE NATURE IN A THOUSAND FORMS
4397-15678-0003 HUNGRY AT TIMES AND WEARY HE HAS CORRESPONDING ENJOYMENT IN EATING AND RESTING AND ALL THE WILDERNESS IS HOME SOME OF THESE RARE HAPPY ROVERS DIE ALONE AMONG THE LEAVES
4397-15678-0004 OTHERS HALF SETTLE DOWN AND CHANGE IN PART INTO FARMERS EACH MAKING CHOICE OF SOME FERTILE SPOT WHERE THE LANDSCAPE ATTRACTS HIM BUILDS A SMALL CABIN WHERE WITH FEW WANTS TO SUPPLY FROM GARDEN OR FIELD HE HUNTS AND FARMS IN TURN
4397-15678-0005 UNTIL NIGHT BEGINS TO DRAW NEAR AND LIKE FOREST SHADOWS THICKENS INTO DARKNESS AND HIS DAY IS DONE IN THESE WASHINGTON WILDS LIVING ALONE ALL SORTS OF MEN MAY PERCHANCE BE FOUND POETS PHILOSOPHERS
4397-15678-0006 AND EVEN FULL BLOWN TRANSCENDENTALISTS THOUGH YOU MAY GO FAR TO FIND THEM INDIANS ARE SELDOM TO BE MET WITH AWAY FROM THE SOUND EXCEPTING ABOUT THE FEW OUTLYING HOP RANCHES TO WHICH THEY RESORT IN GREAT NUMBERS DURING THE PICKING SEASON
4397-15678-0007 NOR IN YOUR WALKS IN THE WOODS WILL YOU BE LIKELY TO SEE MANY OF THE WILD ANIMALS HOWEVER FAR YOU MAY GO WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE DOUGLAS SQUIRREL AND THE MOUNTAIN GOAT THE SQUIRREL IS EVERYWHERE AND THE GOAT YOU CAN HARDLY FAIL TO FIND IF YOU CLIMB ANY OF THE HIGH MOUNTAINS THE DEER
4397-15678-0008 TO MAKE THEIR ESCAPE BY PLUNGING INTO THE WATER AND SWIMMING TO THE ISLANDS OFF SHORE THE ELK AND PERHAPS ALSO THE MOOSE STILL EXIST IN THE MOST REMOTE AND INACCESSIBLE SOLITUDES OF THE FOREST BUT THEIR NUMBERS HAVE BEEN GREATLY REDUCED OF LATE
4397-15678-0009 AND EVEN THE MOST EXPERIENCED HUNTERS HAVE DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THEM OF BEARS THERE ARE TWO SPECIES THE BLACK AND THE LARGE BROWN THE FORMER BY FAR THE MORE COMMON OF THE TWO ON THE SHAGGY BOTTOM LANDS WHERE BERRIES ARE PLENTIFUL
4397-15678-0010 AND ALONG THE RIVERS WHILE SALMON ARE GOING UP TO SPAWN THE BLACK BEAR MAY BE FOUND FAT AND AT HOME MANY ARE KILLED EVERY YEAR BOTH FOR THEIR FLESH AND SKINS THE LARGE BROWN SPECIES LIKES HIGHER AND OPENER GROUND
4397-15678-0011 HE IS A DANGEROUS ANIMAL A NEAR RELATIVE OF THE FAMOUS GRIZZLY AND WISE HUNTERS ARE VERY FOND OF LETTING HIM ALONE THE TOWNS OF PUGET SOUND ARE OF A VERY LIVELY PROGRESSIVE AND ASPIRING KIND
4397-15678-0012 AND THESE TWO ARE KEEN ACTIVE RIVALS TO ALL APPEARANCES WELL MATCHED TACOMA OCCUPIES NEAR THE HEAD OF THE SOUND A SITE OF GREAT NATURAL BEAUTY IT IS THE TERMINUS OF THE NORTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD AND CALLS ITSELF THE CITY OF DESTINY
4397-15678-0013 SEATTLE IS ALSO CHARMINGLY LOCATED ABOUT TWENTY MILES DOWN THE SOUND FROM TACOMA ON ELLIOTT BAY IT IS THE TERMINUS OF THE SEATTLE LAKE SHORE AND EASTERN RAILROAD NOW IN PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTION AND CALLS ITSELF THE QUEEN CITY OF THE SOUND
4397-15678-0014 AMONG THE TREES AND STUMPS AND BRUSH WHICH HIDE A GOOD MANY OF THE HOUSES AND THE STAKES WHICH MARK THE LOTS SO THAT WITHOUT BEING AS YET VERY LARGE TOWNS THEY SEEM TO FADE AWAY INTO THE DISTANCE
4397-15678-0015 PUTTING ON AIRS AS SOME WOULD SAY LIKE BOYS IN HASTE TO BE MEN THEY ARE ALREADY TOWNS WITH ALL MODERN IMPROVEMENTS FIRST CLASS IN EVERY PARTICULAR AS IS SAID OF HOTELS THEY HAVE ELECTRIC MOTORS AND LIGHTS
4397-15678-0016 PAVED BROADWAYS AND BOULEVARDS SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS BLOCKS SCHOOLS CHURCHES FACTORIES AND FOUNDRIES THE LUSTY TITANIC CLANG OF BOILER MAKING MAY BE HEARD THERE
4397-15678-0017 AND PLENTY OF THE LANGUID MUSIC OF PIANOS MINGLING WITH THE BABEL NOISES OF COMMERCE CARRIED ON IN A HUNDRED TONGUES THE MAIN STREETS ARE CROWDED WITH BRIGHT WIDE AWAKE LAWYERS MINISTERS MERCHANTS AGENTS FOR EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN
4397-15678-0018 OX DRIVERS AND LOGGERS IN STIFF GUMMY OVERALLS BACK SLANTING DUDES WELL TAILORED AND SHINY AND FASHIONS AND BONNETS OF EVERY FEATHER AND COLOR BLOOM GAYLY IN THE NOISY THRONG AND ADVERTISE LONDON AND PARIS
4397-15678-0019 VIGOROUS LIFE AND STRIFE ARE TO BE SEEN EVERYWHERE THE SPIRIT OF PROGRESS IS IN THE AIR STILL IT IS HARD TO REALIZE HOW MUCH GOOD WORK IS BEING DONE HERE OF A KIND THAT MAKES FOR CIVILIZATION THE ENTHUSIASTIC EXULTING ENERGY DISPLAYED IN THE BUILDING OF NEW TOWNS
4397-15678-0020 RAILROADS AND MILLS IN THE OPENING OF MINES OF COAL AND IRON AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN GENERAL TO MANY ESPECIALLY IN THE ATLANTIC STATES WASHINGTON IS HARDLY KNOWN AT ALL IT IS REGARDED AS BEING YET A FAR WILD WEST
4397-15678-0021 A DIM NEBULOUS EXPANSE OF WOODS BY THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW THAT RAILROADS AND STEAMERS HAVE BROUGHT THE COUNTRY OUT OF THE WILDERNESS AND ABOLISHED THE OLD DISTANCES IT IS NOW NEAR TO ALL THE WORLD AND IS IN POSSESSION OF A SHARE OF THE BEST OF ALL THAT CIVILIZATION HAS TO OFFER
4397-15678-0022 WHILE ON SOME OF THE LINES OF ADVANCEMENT IT IS AT THE FRONT NOTWITHSTANDING THE SHARP RIVALRY BETWEEN DIFFERENT SECTIONS AND TOWNS THE LEADING MEN MOSTLY PULL TOGETHER FOR THE GENERAL GOOD AND GLORY
4397-15678-0023 BUILDING BUYING BORROWING TO PUSH THE COUNTRY TO ITS PLACE KEEPING ARITHMETIC BUSY IN COUNTING POPULATION PRESENT AND TO COME SHIPS TOWNS FACTORIES TONS OF COAL AND IRON FEET OF LUMBER MILES OF RAILROAD
4397-15678-0024 THEREFORE HOWEVER EXTRAVAGANT AND HIGH THE BRAG ASCENDING FROM PUGET SOUND IN MOST CASES IT IS LIKELY TO APPEAR PARDONABLE AND MORE SEATTLE WAS NAMED AFTER AN OLD INDIAN CHIEF WHO LIVED IN THIS PART OF THE SOUND
4397-15678-0025 HE WAS VERY PROUD OF THE HONOR AND LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO LEAD HIS GRANDCHILDREN ABOUT THE STREETS THE GREATER PART OF THE LOWER BUSINESS PORTION OF THE TOWN INCLUDING A LONG STRETCH OF WHARVES AND WAREHOUSES BUILT ON PILES
4397-15678-0026 THE PEOPLE HOWEVER ARE IN NO WISE DISCOURAGED AND ERE LONG THE LOSS WILL BE GAIN INASMUCH AS A BETTER CLASS OF BUILDINGS CHIEFLY OF BRICK ARE BEING ERECTED IN PLACE OF THE INFLAMMABLE WOODEN ONES WHICH WITH COMPARATIVELY FEW EXCEPTIONS WERE BUILT OF PITCHY SPRUCE
4397-15678-0027 SOME GO BOATING ON THE SOUND OR ON THE LAKES AND RIVERS OR WITH THEIR FAMILIES MAKE EXCURSIONS AT SMALL COST ON THE STEAMERS OTHERS WILL TAKE THE TRAIN TO THE FRANKLIN AND NEWCASTLE OR CARBON RIVER COAL MINES FOR THE SAKE OF THE THIRTY OR FORTY MILE RIDES THROUGH THE WOODS
4397-15678-0028 AND A LOOK INTO THE BLACK DEPTHS OF THE UNDERWORLD OTHERS AGAIN TAKE THE STEAMERS FOR VICTORIA FRASER RIVER OR VANCOUVER THE NEW AMBITIOUS TOWN AT THE TERMINUS OF THE CANADIAN RAILROAD THUS GETTING VIEWS OF THE OUTER WORLD IN A NEAR FOREIGN COUNTRY
4397-15678-0029 GREEN RIVER IS A SMALL ROCKY STREAM WITH PICTURESQUE BANKS AND DERIVES ITS NAME FROM THE BEAUTIFUL PALE GREEN HUE OF ITS WATERS AMONG THE MOST INTERESTING OF ALL THE SUMMER REST AND PLEASURE PLACES IS THE FAMOUS HOP RANCH ON THE UPPER SNOQUALMIE RIVER
4397-15678-0030 THIRTY OR FORTY MILES EASTWARD FROM SEATTLE
4397-15678-0031 HALF PRAIRIE LEVEL AND FERTILE AND BEAUTIFULLY DIVERSIFIED WITH OUTSTANDING GROVES OF SPRUCES AND ALDERS AND RICH FLOWERY FRINGES OF SPIRAEA AND WILD ROSES THE RIVER MEANDERING DEEP AND TRANQUIL THROUGH THE MIDST OF IT
4397-15678-0032 ON THE PORTIONS MOST EASILY CLEARED SOME THREE HUNDRED ACRES OF HOP VINES HAVE BEEN PLANTED AND ARE NOW IN FULL BEARING YIELDING IT IS SAID AT THE RATE OF ABOUT A TON OF HOPS TO THE ACRE THEY ARE A BEAUTIFUL CROP THESE VINES OF THE NORTH
4397-15678-0033 PILLARS OF VERDURE IN REGULAR ROWS SEVEN FEET APART AND EIGHT OR TEN FEET IN HEIGHT THE LONG VIGOROUS SHOOTS SWEEPING ROUND IN FINE WILD FREEDOM AND THE LIGHT LEAFY CONES HANGING IN LOOSE HANDSOME CLUSTERS PERHAPS ENOUGH OF HOPS
4397-15678-0034 MIGHT BE RAISED IN WASHINGTON FOR THE WANTS OF ALL THE WORLD BUT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND PICKERS TO HANDLE THE CROP MOST OF THE PICKING IS DONE BY INDIANS AND TO THIS FINE CLEAN PROFITABLE WORK THEY COME IN GREAT NUMBERS IN THEIR CANOES OLD AND YOUNG
4397-15678-0035 STILL MORE STRIKING ARE THEIR QUEER CAMPS ON THE EDGES OF THE FIELDS OR OVER ON THE RIVER BANK WITH THE FIRELIGHT SHINING ON THEIR WILD JOLLY FACES BUT WOE TO THE RANCH SHOULD FIRE WATER GET THERE BUT THE CHIEF ATTRACTIONS HERE ARE NOT FOUND IN THE HOPS
4397-15678-0036 BUT IN TROUT FISHING AND BEAR HUNTING AND IN THE TWO FINE FALLS ON THE RIVER FORMERLY THE TRIP FROM SEATTLE WAS A HARD ONE OVER CORDUROY ROADS NOW IT IS REACHED IN A FEW HOURS BY RAIL ALONG THE SHORES OF LAKE WASHINGTON AND LAKE SQUAK
4397-15678-0037 AND FINE VIEWS OF THE FALL MAY BE HAD ON THAT SIDE BOTH FROM ABOVE AND BELOW IT IS SITUATED ON THE MAIN RIVER WHERE IT PLUNGES OVER A SHEER PRECIPICE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FEET HIGH IN LEAVING THE LEVEL MEADOWS OF THE ANCIENT LAKE BASIN
4397-15678-0038 THE POOL IS OF CONSIDERABLE DEPTH AS IS SHOWN BY THE RADIATING WELL BEATEN FOAM AND MIST WHICH IS OF A BEAUTIFUL ROSE COLOR AT TIMES OF EXQUISITE FINENESS OF TONE AND BY THE HEAVY WAVES THAT LASH THE ROCKS IN FRONT OF IT
4397-15678-0039 SET IN A ROMANTIC DELL THATCHED WITH DRIPPING MOSSES AND FERNS AND EMBOWERED IN DENSE EVERGREENS AND BLOOMING BUSHES
4397-15678-0040 THE ROAD LEADS THROUGH MAJESTIC WOODS WITH FERNS TEN FEET HIGH BENEATH SOME OF THE THICKETS AND ACROSS A GRAVELLY PLAIN DEFORESTED BY FIRE MANY YEARS AGO ORANGE LILIES ARE PLENTIFUL
4397-15678-0041 AND HANDSOME SHINING MATS OF THE KINNIKINIC SPRINKLED WITH BRIGHT SCARLET BERRIES FROM A PLACE CALLED HUNT'S AT THE END OF THE WAGON ROAD A TRAIL LEADS THROUGH LUSH DRIPPING WOODS NEVER DRY
4397-15678-0042 WHERE NEVER A DUST PARTICLE FLOATED AND WHERE ALL THE FLOWERS FRESH WITH MIST AND SPRAY ARE WETTER THAN WATER LILIES THE POOL AT THE FOOT OF THE FALL IS A PLACE SURPASSINGLY LOVELY TO LOOK AT WITH THE ENTHUSIASTIC RUSH AND SONG OF THE FALLS
4397-15678-0043 THE MAJESTIC TREES OVERHEAD LEANING OVER THE BRINK LIKE LISTENERS EAGER TO CATCH EVERY WORD OF THE WHITE REFRESHING WATERS
4406-16882-0000 BELONGING TO OUR GARRISON BUT NONE OF THEM WOULD STIR THOUGH ANOTHER TIME IF ANY INDIAN HAD COME TO THE DOOR THEY WERE READY TO FLY UPON HIM AND TEAR HIM DOWN THE LORD HEREBY WOULD MAKE US THE MORE ACKNOWLEDGE HIS HAND AND TO SEE THAT OUR HELP IS ALWAYS IN HIM
4406-16882-0001 BUT OUT WE MUST GO THE FIRE INCREASING AND COMING ALONG BEHIND US ROARING AND THE INDIANS GAPING BEFORE US WITH THEIR GUNS SPEARS AND HATCHETS TO DEVOUR US
4406-16882-0002 IN OR NEAR THE THROAT FELL DOWN DEAD WHEREAT THE INDIANS SCORNFULLY SHOUTED AND HALLOWED AND WERE PRESENTLY UPON HIM STRIPPING OFF HIS CLOTHES THE BULLETS FLYING THICK ONE WENT THROUGH MY SIDE AND THE SAME AS WOULD SEEM
4406-16882-0003 THROUGH THE BOWELS AND HAND OF MY DEAR CHILD IN MY ARMS ONE OF MY ELDER SISTERS CHILDREN NAMED WILLIAM HAD THEN HIS LEG BROKEN WHICH THE INDIANS PERCEIVING THEY KNOCKED HIM ON HIS HEAD
4406-16882-0004 STANDING AMAZED WITH THE BLOOD RUNNING DOWN TO OUR HEELS MY ELDEST SISTER BEING YET IN THE HOUSE AND SEEING THOSE WOEFUL SIGHTS THE INFIDELS HAULING MOTHERS ONE WAY AND CHILDREN ANOTHER AND SOME WALLOWING IN THEIR BLOOD
4406-16882-0005 AND HER ELDER SON TELLING HER THAT HER SON WILLIAM WAS DEAD AND MYSELF WAS WOUNDED SHE SAID AND LORD LET ME DIE WITH THEM WHICH WAS NO SOONER SAID BUT SHE WAS STRUCK WITH A BULLET AND FELL DOWN DEAD OVER THE THRESHOLD
4406-16882-0006 I HOPE SHE IS REAPING THE FRUIT OF HER GOOD LABORS BEING FAITHFUL TO THE SERVICE OF GOD IN HER PLACE IN HER YOUNGER YEARS SHE LAY UNDER MUCH TROUBLE UPON SPIRITUAL ACCOUNTS TILL IT PLEASED GOD TO MAKE THAT PRECIOUS SCRIPTURE TAKE HOLD OF HER HEART AND HE SAID UNTO ME
4406-16882-0007 OH THE DOLEFUL SIGHT THAT NOW WAS TO BEHOLD AT THIS HOUSE COME BEHOLD THE WORKS OF THE LORD
4406-16882-0008 AND RELATIONS LIE BLEEDING OUT THEIR HEART BLOOD UPON THE GROUND THERE WAS ONE WHO WAS CHOPPED INTO THE HEAD WITH A HATCHET AND STRIPPED NAKED
4406-16882-0009 AS IF THEY WOULD HAVE TORN OUR VERY HEARTS OUT YET THE LORD BY HIS ALMIGHTY POWER PRESERVED A NUMBER OF US FROM DEATH FOR THERE WERE TWENTY FOUR OF US TAKEN ALIVE AND CARRIED CAPTIVE I HAD OFTEN BEFORE THIS SAID THAT IF THE INDIANS SHOULD COME
4406-16882-0010 I SHOULD CHOOSE RATHER TO BE KILLED BY THEM THAN TAKEN ALIVE BUT WHEN IT CAME TO THE TRIAL MY MIND CHANGED THEIR GLITTERING WEAPONS SO DAUNTED MY SPIRIT THAT I CHOSE RATHER TO GO ALONG WITH THOSE AS I MAY SAY RAVENOUS BEASTS
4406-16882-0011 THAN THAT MOMENT TO END MY DAYS AND THAT I MAY THE BETTER DECLARE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME DURING THAT GRIEVOUS CAPTIVITY I SHALL PARTICULARLY SPEAK OF THE SEVERAL REMOVES WE HAD UP AND DOWN THE WILDERNESS THE FIRST REMOVE NOW AWAY WE MUST GO WITH THOSE BARBAROUS CREATURES
4406-16882-0012 WITH OUR BODIES WOUNDED AND BLEEDING AND OUR HEARTS NO LESS THAN OUR BODIES ABOUT A MILE WE WENT THAT NIGHT UP UPON A HILL WITHIN SIGHT OF THE TOWN WHERE THEY INTENDED TO LODGE THERE WAS HARD BY A VACANT HOUSE DESERTED BY THE ENGLISH BEFORE FOR FEAR OF THE INDIANS
4406-16882-0013 I ASKED THEM WHETHER I MIGHT NOT LODGE IN THE HOUSE THAT NIGHT TO WHICH THEY ANSWERED WHAT WILL YOU LOVE ENGLISH MEN STILL THIS WAS THE DOLEFULEST NIGHT THAT EVER MY EYES SAW OH THE ROARING AND SINGING AND DANCING AND YELLING OF THOSE BLACK CREATURES IN THE NIGHT
4406-16882-0014 SOME ROASTING SOME LYING AND BURNING AND SOME BOILING TO FEED OUR MERCILESS ENEMIES WHO WERE JOYFUL ENOUGH THOUGH WE WERE DISCONSOLATE
4406-16882-0015 AND THE DISMALNESS OF THE PRESENT NIGHT MY THOUGHTS RAN UPON MY LOSSES AND SAD BEREAVED CONDITION ALL WAS GONE MY HUSBAND GONE AT LEAST SEPARATED FROM ME HE BEING IN THE BAY AND TO ADD TO MY GRIEF THE INDIANS TOLD ME THEY WOULD KILL HIM AS HE CAME HOMEWARD
4406-16882-0016 MY CHILDREN GONE MY RELATIONS AND FRIENDS GONE OUR HOUSE AND HOME AND ALL OUR COMFORTS WITHIN DOOR AND WITHOUT ALL WAS GONE EXCEPT MY LIFE AND I KNEW NOT BUT THE NEXT MOMENT THAT MIGHT GO TOO THERE REMAINED NOTHING TO ME BUT ONE POOR WOUNDED BABE
4406-16882-0017 AND IT SEEMED AT PRESENT WORSE THAN DEATH THAT IT WAS IN SUCH A PITIFUL CONDITION BESPEAKING COMPASSION AND I HAD NO REFRESHING FOR IT NOR SUITABLE THINGS TO REVIVE IT LITTLE DO MANY THINK WHAT IS THE SAVAGENESS AND BRUTISHNESS OF THIS BARBAROUS ENEMY
4406-16882-0018 BY ONE EYED JOHN AND MARLBOROUGH'S PRAYING INDIANS WHICH CAPTAIN MOSELY BROUGHT TO BOSTON AS THE INDIANS TOLD ME THE SECOND REMOVE BUT NOW THE NEXT MORNING I MUST TURN MY BACK UPON THE TOWN AND TRAVEL WITH THEM INTO THE VAST AND DESOLATE WILDERNESS
4406-16882-0019 I KNEW NOT WHITHER IT IS NOT MY TONGUE OR PEN CAN EXPRESS THE SORROWS OF MY HEART AND BITTERNESS OF MY SPIRIT THAT I HAD AT THIS DEPARTURE BUT GOD WAS WITH ME IN A WONDERFUL MANNER CARRYING ME ALONG AND BEARING UP MY SPIRIT
4406-16882-0020 THAT IT DID NOT QUITE FAIL ONE OF THE INDIANS CARRIED MY POOR WOUNDED BABE UPON A HORSE IT WENT MOANING ALL ALONG I SHALL DIE I SHALL DIE I WENT ON FOOT AFTER IT WITH SORROW THAT CANNOT BE EXPRESSED AT LENGTH I TOOK IT OFF THE HORSE
4406-16882-0021 AND CARRIED IT IN MY ARMS TILL MY STRENGTH FAILED AND I FELL DOWN WITH IT THEN THEY SET ME UPON A HORSE WITH MY WOUNDED CHILD IN MY LAP AND THERE BEING NO FURNITURE UPON THE HORSE'S BACK AS WE WERE GOING DOWN A STEEP HILL WE BOTH FELL OVER THE HORSE'S HEAD
4406-16882-0022 AT WHICH THEY LIKE INHUMANE CREATURES LAUGHED AND REJOICED TO SEE IT THOUGH I THOUGHT WE SHOULD THERE HAVE ENDED OUR DAYS AS OVERCOME WITH SO MANY DIFFICULTIES BUT THE LORD RENEWED MY STRENGTH STILL AND CARRIED ME ALONG THAT I MIGHT SEE MORE OF HIS POWER
4406-16882-0023 BY A LITTLE FIRE AND A FEW BOUGHS BEHIND ME WITH MY SICK CHILD IN MY LAP
4406-16882-0024 MY OWN WOUND ALSO GROWING SO STIFF THAT I COULD SCARCE SIT DOWN OR RISE UP YET SO IT MUST BE THAT I MUST SIT ALL THIS COLD WINTER NIGHT UPON THE COLD SNOWY GROUND WITH MY SICK CHILD IN MY ARMS
4406-16882-0025 AND WE WERE BOTH ALIVE TO SEE THE LIGHT OF THE NEXT MORNING THE THIRD REMOVE
4406-16882-0026 ONE OF THE INDIANS GOT UP UPON A HORSE AND THEY SET ME UP BEHIND HIM WITH MY POOR SICK BABE IN MY LAP A VERY WEARISOME AND TEDIOUS DAY I HAD OF IT WHAT WITH MY OWN WOUND AND MY CHILD'S BEING SO EXCEEDING SICK AND IN A LAMENTABLE CONDITION WITH HER WOUND
4406-16882-0027 THIS DAY IN THE AFTERNOON ABOUT AN HOUR BY SUN
4406-16882-0028 MY WOUNDS STINK AND ARE CORRUPT I AM TROUBLED I AM BOWED DOWN GREATLY I GO MOURNING ALL THE DAY LONG I SAT MUCH ALONE WITH A POOR WOUNDED CHILD IN MY LAP WHICH MOANED NIGHT AND DAY HAVING NOTHING TO REVIVE THE BODY OR CHEER THE SPIRITS OF HER BUT INSTEAD OF THAT
4406-16882-0029 IN THIS MISERABLE CONDITION WITHOUT ANY REFRESHING OF ONE NATURE OR OTHER EXCEPT A LITTLE COLD WATER I CANNOT BUT TAKE NOTICE HOW AT ANOTHER TIME I COULD NOT BEAR TO BE IN THE ROOM WHERE ANY DEAD PERSON WAS
4406-16882-0030 BY MY MASTER IN THIS WRITING MUST BE UNDERSTOOD QUINNAPIN WHO WAS A SAGAMORE AND MARRIED KING PHILIP'S WIFE'S SISTER NOT THAT HE FIRST TOOK ME BUT I WAS SOLD TO HIM BY ANOTHER NARRAGANSETT INDIAN WHO TOOK ME WHEN FIRST I CAME OUT OF THE GARRISON
4406-16882-0031 THERE WAS NO RESISTING BUT GO I MUST AND LEAVE IT WHEN I HAD BEEN AT MY MASTER'S WIGWAM
4406-16882-0032 WHEN I CAME I ASKED THEM WHAT THEY HAD DONE WITH IT THEN THEY TOLD ME IT WAS UPON THE HILL
4406-16882-0033 AND THERE THEY TOLD ME THEY HAD BURIED IT
4406-16882-0034 GOD HAVING TAKEN AWAY THIS DEAR CHILD I WENT TO SEE MY DAUGHTER MARY WHO WAS AT THIS SAME INDIAN TOWN AT A WIGWAM NOT VERY FAR OFF
4406-16882-0035 SHE WAS ABOUT TEN YEARS OLD AND TAKEN FROM THE DOOR AT FIRST BY A PRAYING INDIANA AND AFTERWARD SOLD FOR A GUN
4406-16882-0036 AND YE WILL TAKE BENJAMIN ALSO ALL THESE THINGS ARE AGAINST ME
4406-16882-0037 AND AS I WAS GOING ALONG MY HEART WAS EVEN OVERWHELMED WITH THE THOUGHTS OF MY CONDITION AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE CHILDREN AND A NATION WHICH I KNEW NOT RULED OVER THEM WHEREUPON I EARNESTLY ENTREATED THE LORD THAT HE WOULD CONSIDER MY LOW ESTATE AND SHOW ME A TOKEN FOR GOOD AND IF IT WERE HIS BLESSED WILL
4406-16882-0038 I HAD NOT SEEN HIM BEFORE SINCE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TOWN AND I KNEW NOT WHERE HE WAS TILL I WAS INFORMED BY HIMSELF THAT HE WAS AMONGST A SMALLER PARCEL OF INDIANS WHOSE PLACE WAS ABOUT SIX MILES OFF WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES HE ASKED ME WHETHER HIS SISTER SARAH WAS DEAD
4406-16882-0039 AND TOLD ME HE HAD SEEN HIS SISTER MARY AND PRAYED ME THAT I WOULD NOT BE TROUBLED IN REFERENCE TO HIMSELF THE OCCASION OF HIS COMING TO SEE ME AT THIS TIME WAS THIS THERE WAS AS I SAID ABOUT SIX MILES FROM US A SMALL PLANTATION OF INDIANS WHERE IT SEEMS HE HAD BEEN DURING HIS CAPTIVITY
4406-16882-0040 ALL THE COMPANY FOR THOSE THAT BELONGED TO THE OTHER SMALL COMPANY CAME THROUGH THE TOWN THAT NOW WE WERE AT BUT BEFORE THEY CAME TO US OH THE OUTRAGEOUS ROARING AND HOOPING THAT THERE WAS THEY BEGAN THEIR DIN ABOUT A MILE BEFORE THEY CAME TO US
4406-16882-0041 BY THEIR NOISE AND HOOPING THEY SIGNIFIED HOW MANY THEY HAD DESTROYED WHICH WAS AT THAT TIME TWENTY THREE
4406-16882-0042 AND EVERY TIME THAT THE OTHER WENT OVER THEIR NUMBER THESE AT HOME GAVE A SHOUT THAT THE VERY EARTH RUNG AGAIN AND THUS THEY CONTINUED TILL THOSE THAT HAD BEEN UPON THE EXPEDITION WERE COME UP TO THE SAGAMORE'S WIGWAM AND THEN
4406-16882-0043 I CANNOT BUT TAKE NOTICE OF THE WONDERFUL MERCY OF GOD TO ME IN THOSE AFFLICTIONS IN SENDING ME A BIBLE ONE OF THE INDIANS THAT CAME FROM MEDFIELD FIGHT HAD BROUGHT SOME PLUNDER CAME TO ME AND ASKED ME IF I WOULD HAVE A BIBLE HE HAD GOT ONE IN HIS BASKET
4406-16882-0044 AND TURN ALL THOSE CURSES UPON OUR ENEMIES I DO NOT DESIRE TO LIVE TO FORGET THIS SCRIPTURE AND WHAT COMFORT IT WAS TO ME NOW
4406-16882-0045 SOME ONE WAY AND SOME ANOTHER THERE WERE NOW BESIDES MYSELF NINE ENGLISH CAPTIVES IN THIS PLACE ALL OF THEM CHILDREN EXCEPT ONE WOMAN
4406-16882-0046 THEY BEING TO GO ONE WAY AND I ANOTHER I ASKED THEM WHETHER THEY WERE EARNEST WITH GOD FOR DELIVERANCE THEY TOLD ME THEY DID AS THEY WERE ABLE AND IT WAS SOME COMFORT TO ME THAT THE LORD STIRRED UP CHILDREN TO LOOK TO HIM
4406-16882-0047 I WISHED HER NOT TO RUN AWAY BY ANY MEANS FOR WE WERE NEAR THIRTY MILES FROM ANY ENGLISH TOWN
4406-16882-0048 AND ANOTHER CHILD IN HER ARMS TWO YEARS OLD AND BAD RIVERS THERE WERE TO GO OVER AND WE WERE FEEBLE WITH OUR POOR AND COARSE ENTERTAINMENT I HAD MY BIBLE WITH ME I PULLED IT OUT AND ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WOULD READ
4406-16882-0049 BE OF GOOD COURAGE AND HE SHALL STRENGTHEN THINE HEART WAIT I SAY ON THE LORD THE FOURTH REMOVE AND NOW I MUST PART WITH THAT LITTLE COMPANY I HAD
4406-16882-0050 SHE WOULD BE OFTEN ASKING THE INDIANS TO LET HER GO HOME THEY NOT BEING WILLING TO THAT AND YET VEXED WITH HER IMPORTUNITY GATHERED A GREAT COMPANY TOGETHER ABOUT HER AND STRIPPED HER NAKED AND SET HER IN THE MIDST OF THEM AND WHEN THEY HAD SUNG AND DANCED ABOUT HER IN THEIR HELLISH MANNER
4406-16882-0051 AS LONG AS THEY PLEASED THEY KNOCKED HER ON HEAD AND THE CHILD IN HER ARMS WITH HER WHEN THEY HAD DONE THAT THEY MADE A FIRE AND PUT THEM BOTH INTO IT
4406-16882-0052 THE CHILDREN SAID SHE DID NOT SHED ONE TEAR BUT PRAYED ALL THE WHILE
4406-16882-0053 WE CAME ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON TO THIS PLACE COLD AND WET AND SNOWY AND HUNGRY AND WEARY AND NO REFRESHING FOR MAN BUT THE COLD GROUND TO SIT ON AND OUR POOR INDIAN CHEER
4406-16882-0054 THIS WAS A SWEET CORDIAL TO ME WHEN I WAS READY TO FAINT MANY AND MANY A TIME HAVE I SAT DOWN AND WEPT SWEETLY OVER THIS SCRIPTURE AT THIS PLACE WE CONTINUED ABOUT FOUR DAYS THE FIFTH REMOVE
4406-16882-0055 AND THEN THEY MADE A STOP AND CHOSE SOME OF THEIR STOUTEST MEN AND SENT THEM BACK TO HOLD THE ENGLISH ARMY IN PLAY WHILST THE REST ESCAPED AND THEN LIKE JEHU THEY MARCHED ON FURIOUSLY WITH THEIR OLD AND WITH THEIR YOUNG SOME CARRIED THEIR OLD DECREPIT MOTHERS
4406-16882-0056 SOME CARRIED ONE AND SOME ANOTHER FOUR OF THEM CARRIED A GREAT INDIAN UPON A BIER BUT GOING THROUGH A THICK WOOD WITH HIM THEY WERE HINDERED AND COULD MAKE NO HASTE WHEREUPON THEY TOOK HIM UPON THEIR BACKS AND CARRIED HIM ONE AT A TIME TILL
4406-16882-0057 UPON A FRIDAY A LITTLE AFTER NOON WE CAME TO THIS RIVER
4406-16882-0058 AND WERE GATHERED TOGETHER I THOUGHT TO COUNT THE NUMBER OF THEM BUT THEY WERE SO MANY AND BEING SOMEWHAT IN MOTION IT WAS BEYOND MY SKILL IN THIS TRAVEL BECAUSE OF MY WOUND I WAS SOMEWHAT FAVORED IN MY LOAD I CARRIED ONLY MY KNITTING WORK AND TWO QUARTS OF PARCHED MEAL
4406-16882-0059 BEING VERY FAINT I ASKED MY MISTRESS TO GIVE ME ONE SPOONFUL OF THE MEAL BUT SHE WOULD NOT GIVE ME A TASTE THEY QUICKLY FELL TO CUTTING DRY TREES TO MAKE RAFTS TO CARRY THEM OVER THE RIVER AND SOON MY TURN CAME TO GO OVER BY THE ADVANTAGE OF SOME BRUSH
4406-16882-0060 WHICH THEY HAD LAID UPON THE RAFT TO SIT UPON I DID NOT WET MY FOOT WHICH MANY OF THEMSELVES AT THE OTHER END WERE MID LEG DEEP WHICH CANNOT BUT BE ACKNOWLEDGED AS A FAVOR OF GOD TO MY WEAKENED BODY IT BEING A VERY COLD TIME I WAS NOT BEFORE ACQUAINTED WITH SUCH
4406-16882-0061 THE FIRST WEEK OF MY BEING AMONG THEM I HARDLY ATE ANY THING THE SECOND WEEK I FOUND MY STOMACH GROW VERY FAINT FOR WANT OF SOMETHING AND YET IT WAS VERY HARD TO GET DOWN THEIR FILTHY TRASH BUT THE THIRD WEEK
4406-16882-0062 I TOLD THEM IT WAS THE SABBATH DAY AND DESIRED THEM TO LET ME REST AND TOLD THEM I WOULD DO AS MUCH MORE TOMORROW TO WHICH THEY ANSWERED ME THEY WOULD BREAK MY FACE AND HERE I CANNOT BUT TAKE NOTICE OF THE STRANGE PROVIDENCE OF GOD IN PRESERVING THE HEATHEN
4406-16882-0063 THEY WERE MANY HUNDREDS OLD AND YOUNG SOME SICK AND SOME LAME MANY HAD PAPOOSES AT THEIR BACKS THE GREATEST NUMBER AT THIS TIME WITH US WERE SQUAWS
4406-16882-0064 IF WE HAD BEEN GOD WOULD HAVE FOUND OUT A WAY FOR THE ENGLISH TO HAVE PASSED THIS RIVER AS WELL AS FOR THE INDIANS WITH THEIR SQUAWS AND CHILDREN AND ALL THEIR LUGGAGE OH THAT MY PEOPLE HAD HEARKENED TO ME AND ISRAEL HAD WALKED IN MY WAYS
4406-16882-0065 THEY SET THEIR WIGWAMS ON FIRE AND WENT AWAY IT WAS A COLD MORNING AND BEFORE US THERE WAS A GREAT BROOK WITH ICE ON IT SOME WADED THROUGH IT UP TO THE KNEES AND HIGHER BUT OTHERS WENT TILL THEY CAME TO A BEAVER DAM AND I AMONGST THEM
4406-16882-0066 WE CAME THAT DAY TO A GREAT SWAMP BY THE SIDE OF WHICH WE TOOK UP OUR LODGING THAT NIGHT WHEN I CAME TO THE BROW OF THE HILL THAT LOOKED TOWARD THE SWAMP I THOUGHT WE HAD BEEN COME TO A GREAT INDIAN TOWN
4406-16882-0067 THOUGH THERE WERE NONE BUT OUR OWN COMPANY THE INDIANS WERE AS THICK AS THE TREES IT SEEMED AS IF THERE HAD BEEN A THOUSAND HATCHETS GOING AT ONCE IF ONE LOOKED BEFORE ONE THERE WAS NOTHING BUT INDIANS AND BEHIND ONE NOTHING BUT INDIANS
4406-16882-0068 AND AN EXCEEDING HIGH AND STEEP HILL BEFORE IT BEFORE I GOT TO THE TOP OF THE HILL I THOUGHT MY HEART AND LEGS AND ALL WOULD HAVE BROKEN AND FAILED ME WHAT THROUGH FAINTNESS AND SORENESS OF BODY IT WAS A GRIEVOUS DAY OF TRAVEL TO ME
4406-16883-0000 AND THE CHANGE THAT HAD COME UPON US WE HAD HUSBAND AND FATHER AND CHILDREN AND SISTERS AND FRIENDS AND RELATIONS AND HOUSE AND HOME AND MANY COMFORTS OF THIS LIFE BUT NOW WE MAY SAY AS JOB
4406-16883-0001 AND HE LIGHTED UPON THAT COMFORTABLE SCRIPTURE I SHALL NOT DIE BUT LIVE AND DECLARE THE WORKS OF THE LORD
4406-16883-0002 EVEN AS THE PSALMIST SAYS TO DECLARE THE WORKS OF THE LORD AND HIS WONDERFUL POWER IN CARRYING US ALONG PRESERVING US IN THE WILDERNESS WHILE UNDER THE ENEMY'S HAND AND RETURNING OF US IN SAFETY AGAIN AND HIS GOODNESS
4406-16883-0003 IN BRINGING TO MY HAND SO MANY COMFORTABLE AND SUITABLE SCRIPTURES IN MY DISTRESS BUT TO RETURN
4406-16883-0004 AND IN THE MORNING WE MUST GO OVER THE RIVER TO PHILIP'S CREW
4406-16883-0005 WHICH WAS THE FIRST TIME TO MY REMEMBRANCE THAT I WEPT BEFORE THEM ALTHOUGH I HAD MET WITH SO MUCH AFFLICTION AND MY HEART WAS MANY TIMES READY TO BREAK YET COULD I NOT SHED ONE TEAR IN THEIR SIGHT BUT RATHER
4406-16883-0006 BY THE RIVERS OF BABYLON THERE WE SATE DOWN
4406-16883-0007 THEN CAME ONE OF THEM AND GAVE ME TWO SPOONFULS OF MEAL TO COMFORT ME AND ANOTHER GAVE ME HALF A PINT OF PEAS WHICH WAS MORE WORTH THAN MANY BUSHELS AT ANOTHER TIME THEN I WENT TO SEE KING PHILIP HE BADE ME COME IN AND SIT DOWN
4406-16883-0008 AND ASKED ME WHETHER I WOULD SMOKE IT A USUAL COMPLIMENT NOWADAYS AMONGST SAINTS AND SINNERS BUT THIS NO WAY SUITED ME FOR THOUGH I HAD FORMERLY USED TOBACCO YET I HAD LEFT IT EVER SINCE I WAS FIRST TAKEN
4406-16883-0009 IT SEEMS TO BE A BAIT THE DEVIL LAYS TO MAKE MEN LOSE THEIR PRECIOUS TIME
4406-16883-0010 WHEN I HAD TAKEN TWO OR THREE PIPES I WAS PRESENTLY READY FOR ANOTHER SUCH A BEWITCHING THING IT IS BUT I THANK GOD HE HAS NOW GIVEN ME POWER OVER IT SURELY THERE ARE MANY WHO
4406-16883-0011 WHEREUPON THEY FELL TO BOILING OF GROUND NUTS AND PARCHING OF CORN
4406-16883-0012 DURING MY ABODE IN THIS PLACE PHILIP SPAKE TO ME TO MAKE A SHIRT FOR HIS BOY WHICH I DID FOR WHICH HE GAVE ME A SHILLING I OFFERED THE MONEY TO MY MASTER BUT HE BADE ME KEEP IT AND WITH IT I BOUGHT A PIECE OF HORSE FLESH
4406-16883-0013 AFTERWARDS HE ASKED ME TO MAKE A CAP FOR HIS BOY FOR WHICH HE INVITED ME TO DINNER I WENT AND HE GAVE ME A PANCAKE ABOUT AS BIG AS TWO FINGERS IT WAS MADE OF PARCHED WHEAT BEATEN AND FRIED IN BEAR'S GREASE
4406-16883-0014 AND BEAR TOGETHER AND INVITED MY MASTER AND MISTRESS TO DINNER BUT THE PROUD GOSSIP BECAUSE I SERVED THEM BOTH IN ONE DISH WOULD EAT NOTHING EXCEPT ONE BIT THAT HE GAVE HER UPON THE POINT OF HIS KNIFE
4406-16883-0015 HEARING THAT MY SON WAS COME TO THIS PLACE I WENT TO SEE HIM AND FOUND HIM LYING FLAT UPON THE GROUND I ASKED HIM HOW HE COULD SLEEP SO HE ANSWERED ME THAT HE WAS NOT ASLEEP BUT AT PRAYER AND LAY SO THAT THEY MIGHT NOT OBSERVE WHAT HE WAS DOING
4406-16883-0016 I PRAY GOD HE MAY REMEMBER THESE THINGS NOW HE IS RETURNED IN SAFETY AT THIS PLACE THE SUN NOW GETTING HIGHER WHAT WITH THE BEAMS AND HEAT OF THE SUN AND THE SMOKE OF THE WIGWAMS I THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN BLIND
4406-16883-0017 WHO OWNED THAT MARY THURSTON CAME RUNNING AFTER ME AND GOT IT AWAY AGAIN
4406-16883-0018 I PUT IT IN MY POCKET TO KEEP IT SAFE YET NOTWITHSTANDING SOMEBODY STOLE IT BUT PUT FIVE INDIAN CORNS IN THE ROOM OF IT WHICH CORNS WERE THE GREATEST PROVISIONS I HAD IN MY TRAVEL FOR ONE DAY
4406-16883-0019 AND SELL ME FOR POWDER FOR SO THEY HAD SOMETIMES DISCOURSED I WAS UTTERLY HOPELESS OF GETTING HOME ON FOOT THE WAY THAT I CAME I COULD HARDLY BEAR TO THINK OF THE MANY WEARY STEPS I HAD TAKEN TO COME TO THIS PLACE THE NINTH REMOVE
4406-16883-0020 BUT INSTEAD OF GOING EITHER TO ALBANY OR HOMEWARD WE MUST GO FIVE MILES UP THE RIVER AND THEN GO OVER IT HERE WE ABODE A WHILE HERE LIVED A SORRY INDIAN WHO SPOKE TO ME TO MAKE HIM A SHIRT WHEN I HAD DONE IT HE WOULD PAY ME NOTHING
4406-16883-0021 BUT HE LIVING BY THE RIVERSIDE WHERE I OFTEN WENT TO FETCH WATER I WOULD OFTEN BE PUTTING OF HIM IN MIND AND CALLING FOR MY PAY AT LAST HE TOLD ME IF I WOULD MAKE ANOTHER SHIRT FOR A PAPOOSE NOT YET BORN HE WOULD GIVE ME A KNIFE WHICH HE DID WHEN I HAD DONE IT
4406-16883-0022 AND I WAS NOT A LITTLE GLAD THAT I HAD ANYTHING THAT THEY WOULD ACCEPT OF AND BE PLEASED WITH WHEN WE WERE AT THIS PLACE MY MASTER'S MAID CAME HOME SHE HAD BEEN GONE THREE WEEKS INTO THE NARRAGANSETT COUNTRY TO FETCH CORN
4406-16883-0023 WHERE THEY HAD STORED UP SOME IN THE GROUND
4406-16883-0024 I TURNED HOMEWARD AGAIN AND MET WITH MY MASTER HE SHOWED ME THE WAY TO MY SON WHEN I CAME TO HIM I FOUND HIM NOT WELL AND WITHALL HE HAD A BOIL ON HIS SIDE WHICH MUCH TROUBLED HIM WE BEMOANED ONE ANOTHER A WHILE AS THE LORD HELPED US
4406-16883-0025 AND THEN I RETURNED AGAIN WHEN I WAS RETURNED I FOUND MYSELF AS UNSATISFIED AS I WAS BEFORE
4406-16883-0026 MY SON WAS ILL AND I COULD NOT BUT THINK OF HIS MOURNFUL LOOKS AND NO CHRISTIAN FRIEND WAS NEAR HIM TO DO ANY OFFICE OF LOVE FOR HIM EITHER FOR SOUL OR BODY AND MY POOR GIRL I KNEW NOT WHERE SHE WAS NOR WHETHER SHE WAS SICK OR WELL OR ALIVE OR DEAD
4406-16883-0027 I REPAIRED UNDER THESE THOUGHTS TO MY BIBLE MY GREAT COMFORT IN THAT TIME AND THAT SCRIPTURE CAME TO MY HAND CAST THY BURDEN UPON THE LORD AND HE SHALL SUSTAIN THEE PSALM FIFTY FIVE
4406-16883-0028 FOR FEAR THEY WOULD GET IT FROM ME AND THERE IT LAY ALL THAT DAY AND NIGHT IN MY STINKING POCKET
4406-16883-0029 BUT NOW THAT WAS SAVORY TO ME THAT ONE WOULD THINK WAS ENOUGH TO TURN THE STOMACH OF A BRUTE CREATURE ONE BITTER COLD DAY I COULD FIND NO ROOM TO SIT DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE
4406-16883-0030 AND GAVE ME SOME GROUND NUTS AND BADE ME COME AGAIN AND TOLD ME THEY WOULD BUY ME IF THEY WERE ABLE AND YET THESE WERE STRANGERS TO ME THAT I NEVER SAW BEFORE THE TENTH REMOVE
4406-16883-0031 AND PUT IT INTO MY POCKET AND NEVER LET HER SEE IT AFTERWARD THEN THEY PACKED UP THEIR THINGS TO BE GONE AND GAVE ME MY LOAD I COMPLAINED IT WAS TOO HEAVY WHEREUPON SHE GAVE ME A SLAP IN THE FACE AND BADE ME GO
4406-16883-0032 I LIFTED UP MY HEART TO GOD HOPING THE REDEMPTION WAS NOT FAR OFF AND THE RATHER BECAUSE THEIR INSOLENCY GREW WORSE AND WORSE BUT THE THOUGHTS OF MY GOING HOMEWARD FOR SO WE BENT OUR COURSE
4406-16883-0033 MUCH CHEERED MY SPIRIT AND MADE MY BURDEN SEEM LIGHT AND ALMOST NOTHING AT ALL BUT TO MY AMAZEMENT AND GREAT PERPLEXITY THE SCALE WAS SOON TURNED FOR WHEN WE HAD GONE A LITTLE WAY ON A SUDDEN MY MISTRESS GIVES OUT
4406-16883-0034 AND WOULD HAVE HAD HIM GONE BACK ALSO BUT HE WOULD NOT BUT SAID HE WOULD GO ON AND COME TO US AGAIN IN THREE DAYS MY SPIRIT WAS UPON THIS I CONFESS VERY IMPATIENT AND ALMOST OUTRAGEOUS
4406-16883-0035 BE STILL AND KNOW THAT I AM GOD PSALM FORTY SIX
4406-16883-0036 WHICH WERE SOME REFRESHMENT TO ME TOWARDS NIGHT I GATHERED SOME STICKS FOR MY OWN COMFORT THAT I MIGHT NOT LIE A COLD BUT WHEN WE CAME TO LIE DOWN THEY BADE ME TO GO OUT AND LIE SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR THEY HAD COMPANY THEY SAID COME IN MORE THAN THEIR OWN
4406-16883-0037 I TOLD THEM I COULD NOT TELL WHERE TO GO THEY BADE ME GO LOOK I TOLD THEM IF I WENT TO ANOTHER WIGWAM THEY WOULD BE ANGRY AND SEND ME HOME AGAIN THEN ONE OF THE COMPANY DREW HIS SWORD AND TOLD ME HE WOULD RUN ME THROUGH IF I DID NOT GO PRESENTLY THEN
4406-16883-0038 WAS I FAIN TO STOOP TO THIS RUDE FELLOW AND TO GO OUT IN THE NIGHT I KNEW NOT WHITHER MINE EYES HAVE SEEN THAT FELLOW AFTERWARDS WALKING UP AND DOWN BOSTON UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF A FRIEND INDIAN AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF THE LIKE CUT
4406-16883-0039 I WENT TO ONE WIGWAM AND THEY TOLD ME THEY HAD NO ROOM THEN I WENT TO ANOTHER AND THEY SAID THE SAME AT LAST AN OLD INDIAN BADE ME TO COME TO HIM AND HIS SQUAW GAVE ME SOME GROUND NUTS
4406-16883-0040 AND A GOOD FIRE WE HAD AND THROUGH THE GOOD PROVIDENCE OF GOD I HAD A COMFORTABLE LODGING THAT NIGHT IN THE MORNING ANOTHER INDIAN BADE ME COME AT NIGHT AND HE WOULD GIVE ME SIX GROUND NUTS WHICH I DID
4406-16883-0041 WE WENT IN THE MORNING TO GATHER GROUND NUTS TO THE RIVER AND WENT BACK AGAIN THAT NIGHT I WENT WITH A GOOD LOAD AT MY BACK FOR THEY WHEN THEY WENT THOUGH BUT A LITTLE WAY WOULD CARRY ALL THEIR TRUMPERY WITH THEM I TOLD THEM THE SKIN WAS OFF MY BACK
4406-16883-0042 BUT I HAD NO OTHER COMFORTING ANSWER FROM THEM THAN THIS THAT IT WOULD BE NO MATTER IF MY HEAD WERE OFF TOO THE THIRTEENTH REMOVE INSTEAD OF GOING TOWARD THE BAY WHICH WAS THAT I DESIRED
4406-16883-0043 WHERE WE ABODE ALMOST A FORTNIGHT HERE ONE ASKED ME TO MAKE A SHIRT FOR HER PAPOOSE FOR WHICH SHE GAVE ME A MESS OF BROTH WHICH WAS THICKENED WITH MEAL MADE OF THE BARK OF A TREE AND TO MAKE IT THE BETTER
4406-16883-0044 AND A FEW ROASTED GROUND NUTS I HAD NOT SEEN MY SON A PRETTY WHILE
4406-16883-0045 AND ASKED HIM WHEN HE SAW HIM HE ANSWERED ME THAT SUCH A TIME HIS MASTER ROASTED HIM
4406-16883-0046 AS BIG AS HIS TWO FINGERS AND THAT HE WAS VERY GOOD MEAT BUT THE LORD UPHELD MY SPIRIT UNDER THIS DISCOURAGEMENT
4406-16883-0047 THAT MAKES THE LEAST CONSCIENCE OF SPEAKING OF TRUTH IN THIS PLACE ON A COLD NIGHT AS I LAY BY THE FIRE I REMOVED A STICK THAT KEPT THE HEAT FROM ME
4406-16883-0048 YET UPON THIS AND THE LIKE OCCASIONS I HOPE IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY WITH JOB
4406-16883-0049 BUT WHEN I WAS WITHOUT AND SAW NOTHING BUT WILDERNESS AND WOODS AND A COMPANY OF BARBAROUS HEATHENS MY MIND QUICKLY RETURNED TO ME WHICH MADE ME THINK OF THAT SPOKEN CONCERNING SAMPSON WHO SAID I WILL GO OUT AND SHAKE MYSELF AS AT OTHER TIMES
4406-16883-0050 BUT HE WIST NOT THAT THE LORD WAS DEPARTED FROM HIM ABOUT THIS TIME I BEGAN TO THINK THAT ALL MY HOPES OF RESTORATION WOULD COME TO NOTHING I THOUGHT OF THE ENGLISH ARMY AND HOPED FOR THEIR COMING AND BEING TAKEN BY THEM BUT THAT FAILED
4406-16883-0051 I HOPED TO BE CARRIED TO ALBANY AS THE INDIANS HAD DISCOURSED BEFORE BUT THAT FAILED ALSO I THOUGHT OF BEING SOLD TO MY HUSBAND
4406-16883-0052 AS MY MASTER SPAKE BUT INSTEAD OF THAT MY MASTER HIMSELF WAS GONE AND I LEFT BEHIND SO THAT MY SPIRIT WAS NOW QUITE READY TO SINK I ASKED THEM TO LET ME GO OUT AND PICK UP SOME STICKS THAT I MIGHT GET ALONE AND POUR OUT MY HEART UNTO THE LORD
4406-16883-0053 THEY ALL GATHERED ABOUT THE POOR MAN ASKING HIM MANY QUESTIONS I DESIRED ALSO TO GO AND SEE HIM AND WHEN I CAME HE WAS CRYING BITTERLY SUPPOSING THEY WOULD QUICKLY KILL HIM WHEREUPON I ASKED ONE OF THEM WHETHER THEY INTENDED TO KILL HIM HE ANSWERED ME THEY WOULD NOT
4406-16883-0054 HE BEING A LITTLE CHEERED WITH THAT I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE WELFARE OF MY HUSBAND HE TOLD ME HE SAW HIM SUCH A TIME IN THE BAY AND HE WAS WELL BUT VERY MELANCHOLY BY WHICH I CERTAINLY UNDERSTOOD THOUGH I SUSPECTED IT BEFORE
4406-16883-0055 THAT WHATSOEVER THE INDIANS TOLD ME RESPECTING HIM WAS VANITY AND LIES SOME OF THEM TOLD ME HE WAS DEAD AND THEY HAD KILLED HIM SOME SAID HE WAS MARRIED AGAIN AND THAT THE GOVERNOR WISHED HIM TO MARRY AND TOLD HIM HE SHOULD HAVE HIS CHOICE
4406-16883-0056 AND THAT ALL PERSUADED I WAS DEAD SO LIKE WERE THESE BARBAROUS CREATURES TO HIM WHO WAS A LIAR FROM THE BEGINNING AS I WAS SITTING ONCE IN THE WIGWAM HERE PHILIP'S MAID CAME IN WITH THE CHILD IN HER ARMS
4406-16883-0057 I TOLD HER I WOULD TEAR HER COAT THEN WITH THAT MY MISTRESS RISES UP
4406-16883-0058 WERE GOING TO THE FRENCH FOR POWDER BUT BY THE WAY THE MOHAWKS MET WITH THEM AND KILLED FOUR OF THEIR COMPANY WHICH MADE THE REST TURN BACK AGAIN FOR IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORSE WITH HIM HAD HE BEEN SOLD TO THE FRENCH
4406-16883-0059 THAN IT PROVED TO BE IN HIS REMAINING WITH THE INDIANS I WENT TO SEE AN ENGLISH YOUTH IN THIS PLACE
4406-16883-0060 HE TOLD ME HE WAS VERY SICK OF A FLUX WITH EATING SO MUCH BLOOD THEY HAD TURNED HIM OUT OF THE WIGWAM AND WITH HIM AN INDIAN PAPOOSE ALMOST DEAD WHOSE PARENTS HAD BEEN KILLED
441-128982-0000 WHEN THE LITTLE FLEET OF SPANISH VESSELS INCLUDING THE ONE WHICH HAD BEEN CAPTURED BY BARTHOLEMY PORTUGUEZ AND HIS MEN WERE ON THEIR WAY TO CAMPEACHY THEY MET WITH VERY STORMY WEATHER SO THAT THEY WERE SEPARATED AND THE SHIP WHICH CONTAINED BARTHOLEMY AND HIS COMPANIONS ARRIVED FIRST AT THE PORT FOR WHICH THEY WERE BOUND
441-128982-0001 THE CAPTAIN WHO HAD BARTHOLEMY AND THE OTHERS IN CHARGE DID NOT KNOW WHAT AN IMPORTANT CAPTURE HE HAD MADE HE SUPPOSED THAT THESE PIRATES WERE ORDINARY BUCCANEERS AND IT APPEARS THAT IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO KEEP THEM AS HIS OWN PRIVATE PRISONERS
441-128982-0002 FOR AS THEY WERE ALL VERY ABLE BODIED MEN THEY WOULD BE EXTREMELY USEFUL ON A SHIP BUT WHEN HIS VESSEL WAS SAFELY MOORED AND IT BECAME KNOWN IN THE TOWN THAT HE HAD A COMPANY OF PIRATES ON BOARD
441-128982-0003 AND WHO HAD HEARD OF HIS VARIOUS EXPLOITS HE THEREFORE WENT TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE VESSEL AND INFORMED HIM THAT HE HAD ON BOARD ONE OF THE VERY WORST PIRATES IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHOSE WICKED DEEDS WERE WELL KNOWN IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WEST INDIES
441-128982-0004 AND WHO OUGHT IMMEDIATELY TO BE DELIVERED UP TO THE CIVIL AUTHORITIES THIS PROPOSAL HOWEVER MET WITH NO FAVOR FROM THE SPANISH CAPTAIN WHO HAD FOUND BARTHOLEMY A VERY QUIET MAN AND COULD SEE THAT HE WAS A VERY STRONG ONE
441-128982-0005 AND HE DID NOT AT ALL DESIRE TO GIVE UP SUCH A VALUABLE ADDITION TO HIS CREW BUT THE MERCHANT GREW VERY ANGRY FOR HE KNEW THAT BARTHOLEMY HAD INFLICTED GREAT INJURY ON SPANISH COMMERCE AND AS THE CAPTAIN WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM HE WENT TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE TOWN AND REPORTED THE CASE
441-128982-0006 WHEN THIS DIGNITARY HEARD THE STORY HE IMMEDIATELY SENT A PARTY OF OFFICERS TO THE SHIP AND COMMANDED THE CAPTAIN TO DELIVER THE PIRATE LEADER INTO THEIR CHARGE THE OTHER MEN WERE LEFT WHERE THEY WERE
441-128982-0007 BUT HE DID NOT LOSE HEART AND IMMEDIATELY SET TO WORK TO FREE HIMSELF FROM HIS IRONS WHICH WERE PROBABLY VERY CLUMSY AFFAIRS AT LAST CARING LITTLE HOW MUCH HE SCRATCHED AND TORE HIS SKIN
441-128982-0008 HE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING RID OF HIS FETTERS AND COULD MOVE ABOUT AS FREELY AS A TIGER IN A CAGE TO GET OUT OF THIS CAGE WAS BARTHOLEMY'S FIRST OBJECT IT WOULD BE COMPARATIVELY EASY BECAUSE IN THE COURSE OF TIME SOME ONE WOULD COME INTO THE HOLD
441-128982-0009 AND THE ATHLETIC BUCCANEER THOUGHT THAT HE COULD EASILY GET THE BETTER OF WHOEVER MIGHT OPEN THE HATCH BUT THE NEXT ACT IN THIS TRULY MELODRAMATIC PERFORMANCE WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL MORE DIFFICULT FOR IN ORDER TO ESCAPE FROM THE SHIP IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR BARTHOLEMY TO SWIM TO SHORE
441-128982-0010 AND HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SWIM WHICH SEEMS A STRANGE FAILING IN A HARDY SAILOR WITH SO MANY OTHER NAUTICAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE ROUGH HOLD WHERE HE WAS SHUT UP OUR PIRATE PEERING ABOUT ANXIOUS AND EARNEST
441-128982-0011 HE WAS SATISFIED THAT THIS UNWIELDY CONTRIVANCE WOULD SUPPORT HIM IN THE WATER AMONG OTHER THINGS HE HAD FOUND IN HIS RUMMAGINGS ABOUT THE HOLD WAS AN OLD KNIFE AND WITH THIS IN HIS HAND HE NOW SAT WAITING FOR A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO ATTACK HIS SENTINEL
441-128982-0012 THIS CAME SOON AFTER NIGHTFALL A MAN DESCENDED WITH A LANTERN TO SEE THAT THE PRISONER WAS STILL SECURE LET US HOPE THAT IT WAS NOT THE SOLDIER WHO HAD KINDLY INFORMED HIM OF HIS FATE AND AS SOON AS HE WAS FAIRLY IN THE HOLD BARTHOLEMY SPRANG UPON HIM
441-128982-0013 THERE WAS A FIERCE STRUGGLE BUT THE PIRATE WAS QUICK AND POWERFUL AND THE SENTINEL WAS SOON DEAD THEN CARRYING HIS TWO JARS BARTHOLEMY CLIMBED SWIFTLY AND NOISELESSLY UP THE SHORT LADDER
441-128982-0014 FOR A MOMENT HE SANK BELOW THE SURFACE BUT THE TWO AIR TIGHT JARS QUICKLY ROSE AND BORE HIM UP WITH THEM THERE WAS A BUSTLE ON BOARD THE SHIP THERE WAS SOME RANDOM FIRING OF MUSKETS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SPLASHING WHICH THE WATCH HAD HEARD
441-128982-0015 BUT NONE OF THE BALLS STRUCK THE PIRATE OR HIS JARS AND HE SOON FLOATED OUT OF SIGHT AND HEARING KICKING OUT WITH HIS LEGS AND PADDLING AS WELL AS HE COULD WITH ONE HAND WHILE HE HELD ON TO THE JARS WITH THE OTHER HE AT LAST MANAGED TO REACH THE LAND
441-128982-0016 AND RAN AS FAST AS HE COULD INTO THE DARK WOODS BEYOND THE TOWN BARTHOLEMY WAS NOW GREATLY IN FEAR THAT WHEN HIS ESCAPE WAS DISCOVERED HE WOULD BE TRACKED BY BLOODHOUNDS
441-128982-0017 WHICH WAS WHAT HE WISHED TO DO IF THE HOUNDS SHOULD GET UPON HIS TRAIL HE WAS A LOST MAN THE DESPERATE PIRATE THEREFORE DETERMINED TO GIVE THE BLOODHOUNDS NO CHANCE TO FOLLOW HIM AND FOR THREE DAYS HE REMAINED IN A MARSHY FOREST IN THE DARK RECESSES OF WHICH HE COULD HIDE
441-128982-0018 AND WHERE THE WATER WHICH COVERED THE GROUND PREVENTED THE DOGS FROM FOLLOWING HIS SCENT HE HAD NOTHING TO EAT EXCEPT A FEW ROOTS OF WATER PLANTS BUT HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO PRIVATION AND THESE KEPT HIM ALIVE OFTEN HE HEARD THE HOUNDS BAYING ON THE DRY LAND ADJOINING THE MARSH
441-128982-0019 AND SOMETIMES HE SAW AT NIGHT DISTANT TORCHES WHICH HE WAS SURE WERE CARRIED BY MEN WHO WERE HUNTING FOR HIM BUT AT LAST THE PURSUIT SEEMED TO BE GIVEN UP AND HEARING NO MORE DOGS AND SEEING NO MORE FLICKERING LIGHTS BARTHOLEMY LEFT THE MARSH AND SET OUT ON HIS LONG JOURNEY DOWN THE COAST
441-128982-0020 WHICH WAS FORTY LEAGUES AWAY BUT WHERE HE HAD REASON TO SUPPOSE HE WOULD FIND SOME FRIENDS WHEN HE CAME OUT FROM AMONG THE TREES HE MOUNTED A SMALL HILL AND LOOKED BACK UPON THE TOWN THE PUBLIC SQUARE WAS LIGHTED AND THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT HE SAW THE GALLOWS WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR HIS EXECUTION
441-128982-0021 AND THIS SIGHT DOUBTLESS ANIMATED HIM VERY MUCH DURING THE FIRST PART OF HIS JOURNEY THE TERRIBLE TRIALS AND HARDSHIPS WHICH BARTHOLEMY EXPERIENCED DURING HIS TRAMP ALONG THE COAST WERE SUCH AS COULD HAVE BEEN ENDURED ONLY BY ONE OF THE STRONGEST AND TOUGHEST OF MEN
441-128982-0022 BUT AFTER A DIET OF ROOTS SHELLFISH MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY AGREEABLE CHANGE AND THEY GAVE HIM ALL THE STRENGTH AND VIGOR HE NEEDED VERY OFTEN HE FOUND STREAMS AND INLETS WHICH HE WAS OBLIGED TO FORD
441-128982-0023 WHEN HE HAD MADE FOR HIMSELF WHAT SEEMED TO BE A FREE PASSAGE HE WOULD DASH IN AND HURRY ACROSS AT OTHER TIMES GREAT FORESTS STRETCHED DOWN TO THE VERY COAST AND THROUGH THESE HE WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE HIS WAY
441-128982-0024 ALTHOUGH HE COULD HEAR THE ROARS AND SCREAMS OF WILD BEASTS ALL ABOUT HIM ANY ONE WHO IS AFRAID TO GO DOWN INTO A DARK CELLAR TO GET SOME APPLES FROM A BARREL AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS CAN HAVE NO IDEA OF THE SORT OF MIND POSSESSED BY BARTHOLEMY PORTUGUEZ
441-128982-0025 THE ANIMALS MIGHT HOWL AROUND HIM AND GLARE AT HIM WITH THEIR SHINING EYES AND THE ALLIGATORS MIGHT LASH THE WATER INTO FOAM WITH THEIR GREAT TAILS
441-128982-0026 THIS WAS A WIDE RIVER FLOWING THROUGH THE INLAND COUNTRY INTO THE SEA HE MADE HIS WAY UP THE SHORE OF THIS RIVER FOR A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE BUT IT GREW BUT LITTLE NARROWER AND HE COULD SEE NO CHANCE OF GETTING ACROSS HE COULD NOT SWIM
441-128982-0027 AND HE HAD NO WINE JARS NOW WITH WHICH TO BUOY HIMSELF UP
441-128982-0028 BUT A MAN IN HIS SITUATION WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO GIVE UP READILY
441-128982-0029 NOW A PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAPPENED TO HIM ALTHOUGH TO AN ORDINARY TRAVELLER IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A MATTER OF NO IMPORTANCE WHATEVER ON THE EDGE OF THE SHORE WHERE IT HAD FLOATED DOWN FROM SOME REGION HIGHER UP THE RIVER
441-128982-0030 BARTHOLEMY PERCEIVED AN OLD BOARD IN WHICH THERE WERE SOME LONG AND HEAVY RUSTY NAILS GREATLY ENCOURAGED BY THIS DISCOVERY THE INDEFATIGABLE TRAVELLER SET ABOUT A WORK WHICH RESEMBLED THAT OF THE OLD WOMAN WHO WANTED A NEEDLE
441-128982-0031 AND WHO BEGAN TO RUB A CROW BAR ON A STONE IN ORDER TO REDUCE IT TO THE PROPER SIZE BARTHOLEMY CAREFULLY KNOCKED ALL THE NAILS OUT OF THE BOARD AND THEN FINDING A LARGE FLAT STONE HE RUBBED DOWN ONE OF THEM UNTIL HE HAD FORMED IT INTO THE SHAPE OF A RUDE KNIFE BLADE
441-128982-0032 WHICH HE MADE AS SHARP AS HE COULD THEN WITH THESE TOOLS HE UNDERTOOK THE CONSTRUCTION OF A RAFT WORKING AWAY LIKE A BEAVER AND USING THE SHARPENED NAILS INSTEAD OF HIS TEETH
441-128982-0033 HE CUT DOWN A NUMBER OF SMALL TREES AND WHEN HE HAD ENOUGH OF THESE SLENDER TRUNKS HE BOUND THEM TOGETHER WITH REEDS AND OSIERS WHICH HE FOUND ON THE RIVER BANK SO AFTER INFINITE LABOR AND TRIAL HE CONSTRUCTED A RAFT WHICH WOULD BEAR HIM ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
441-128982-0034 GATHERING UP HIS LEGS SO AS TO KEEP OUT OF REACH OF THE ALLIGATORS AND WITH A LONG POLE PUSHED HIMSELF OFF FROM SHORE SOMETIMES PADDLING AND SOMETIMES PUSHING HIS POLE AGAINST THE BOTTOM HE AT LAST GOT ACROSS THE RIVER AND TOOK UP HIS JOURNEY UPON DRY LAND
441-128982-0035 EVEN IF HE COULD NOT WALK NO ATHLETE OF THE PRESENT DAY NO MATTER IF HE SHOULD BE A MOST ACCOMPLISHED CIRCUS MAN COULD REASONABLY EXPECT TO PERFORM THE FEAT WHICH THIS BOLD PIRATE SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISHED FOR FIVE OR SIX LEAGUES HE WENT THROUGH THAT MANGROVE FOREST
441-128982-0036 NEVER ONCE SETTING HIS FOOT UPON THE GROUND BY WHICH IS MEANT MUD WATER AND ROOTS BUT SWINGING HIMSELF BY HIS HANDS AND ARMS FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH AS IF HE HAD BEEN A GREAT APE ONLY RESTING OCCASIONALLY DRAWING HIMSELF UPON A STOUT LIMB WHERE HE MIGHT SIT FOR A WHILE AND GET HIS BREATH
441-128988-0000 CHAPTER THIRTEEN A RESURRECTED PIRATE
441-128988-0001 THAT HE HAD COME BACK A COMPARATIVE PAUPER SURPRISED NO ONE FOR THIS WAS A COMMON THING TO HAPPEN TO A PIRATE BUT THE WONDER WAS THAT HE GOT BACK AT ALL HE HAD NO MONEY BUT BY THE EXERCISE OF HIS CRAFTY ABILITIES
441-128988-0002 HE MANAGED TO GET POSSESSION OF A SHIP WHICH HE MANNED WITH A CREW OF ABOUT A SCORE OF IMPECUNIOUS DARE DEVILS WHO WERE VERY ANXIOUS TO DO SOMETHING TO MEND THEIR FORTUNES HAVING NOW BECOME VERY FOND OF LAND FIGHTING
441-128988-0003 HE DID NOT GO OUT IN SEARCH OF SHIPS BUT DIRECTED HIS VESSEL TO A LITTLE VILLAGE CALLED DE LOS CAYOS ON THE COAST OF CUBA FOR HERE HE THOUGHT WAS A CHANCE FOR A GOOD AND EASY STROKE OF BUSINESS
441-128988-0004 SO THAT LARGE SHIPS COULD NOT APPROACH VERY NEAR AND THUS THE VILLAGERS WERE KEPT BUSY CARRYING GOODS AND SUPPLIES IN SMALL BOATS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS FROM THE TOWN TO THE VESSELS AT ANCHOR
441-128988-0005 HERE WAS A NICE LITTLE PRIZE THAT COULD NOT GET AWAY FROM HIM AND L'OLONNOIS HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO MAKE HIS PREPARATIONS TO SEIZE IT AS HE COULD NOT SAIL A SHIP DIRECTLY UP TO THE TOWN
441-128988-0006 HE CRUISED ABOUT THE COAST AT SOME DISTANCE FROM DE LOS CAYOS ENDEAVORING TO PROCURE TWO SMALL BOATS IN WHICH TO APPROACH THE TOWN BUT ALTHOUGH HIS PREPARATIONS WERE MADE AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE THE PRESENCE OF HIS VESSEL WAS DISCOVERED BY SOME FISHERMEN
441-128988-0007 INFORMING THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND THAT THE CRUEL PIRATE L'OLONNOIS WAS IN A SHIP A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THEIR VILLAGE WHICH HE UNDOUBTEDLY INTENDED TO ATTACK WHEN THE GOVERNOR HEARD THIS ASTONISHING TALE
441-128988-0008 IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO BELIEVE IT THE GOOD NEWS OF THE DEATH OF L'OLONNOIS HAD COME FROM CAMPEACHY TO HAVANA AND THE PEOPLE OF THE LATTER TOWN ALSO REJOICED GREATLY TO BE NOW TOLD THAT THIS SCOURGE OF THE WEST INDIES WAS ALIVE
441-128988-0009 AND WAS ABOUT TO FALL UPON A PEACEFUL LITTLE VILLAGE ON THE ISLAND OVER WHICH HE RULED FILLED THE GOVERNOR WITH RAGE AS WELL AS AMAZEMENT AND HE ORDERED A WELL ARMED SHIP WITH A LARGE CREW OF FIGHTING MEN TO SAIL IMMEDIATELY FOR DE LOS CAYOS
441-128988-0010 BY THE TIME THE WAR VESSEL HAD ARRIVED AT DE LOS CAYOS L'OLONNOIS HAD MADE HIS PREPARATION TO ATTACK THE PLACE HE HAD PROCURED TWO LARGE CANOES AND IN THESE HE HAD INTENDED TO ROW UP TO THE TOWN AND LAND WITH HIS MEN
441-128988-0011 BUT NOW THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THE STATE OF AFFAIRS AND HE WAS OBLIGED TO ALTER HIS PLANS THE ORDINARY PERSON IN COMMAND OF TWO SMALL BOATS WHO SHOULD SUDDENLY DISCOVER THAT A VILLAGE WHICH HE SUPPOSED ALMOST DEFENCELESS WAS PROTECTED BY A LARGE MAN OF WAR
441-128988-0012 WITH CANNON AND A WELL ARMED CREW WOULD HAVE ALTERED HIS PLANS SO COMPLETELY THAT HE WOULD HAVE LEFT THAT PART OF THE COAST OF CUBA WITH ALL POSSIBLE EXPEDITION BUT THE PIRATES OF THAT DAY SEEMED TO PAY VERY LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE ELEMENT OF ODDS
441-128988-0013 IF THEY MET AN ENEMY WHO WAS WEAK THEY WOULD FALL UPON HIM AND IF THEY MET WITH ONE WHO WAS A GOOD DEAL STRONGER THAN THEMSELVES THEY WOULD FALL UPON HIM ALL THE SAME WHEN THE TIME CAME TO FIGHT THEY FOUGHT
441-128988-0014 BUT NO INTENTION OF GIVING UP HIS PROJECT ENTERED HIS MIND AS THE SPANISH VESSEL WAS IN HIS WAY HE WOULD ATTACK HER AND GET HER OUT OF HIS WAY IF THE THING COULD BE DONE IN THIS NEW STATE OF AFFAIRS HE WAS OBLIGED TO USE STRATAGEM
441-128988-0015 AND HE ALSO NEEDED A LARGER FORCE THAN HE HAD WITH HIM AND HE THEREFORE CAPTURED SOME MEN WHO WERE FISHING ALONG THE COAST AND PUT THEM INTO HIS CANOES TO HELP WORK THE OARS THEN BY NIGHT HE PROCEEDED SLOWLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SPANISH VESSEL
441-128988-0016 THE MAN OF WAR WAS ANCHORED NOT VERY FAR FROM THE TOWN AND WHEN ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE WATCH ON DECK SAW SOME CANOES APPROACHING THEY SUPPOSED THEM TO BE BOATS FROM SHORE
441-128988-0017 FOR AS HAS BEEN SAID SUCH VESSELS WERE CONTINUALLY PLYING ABOUT THOSE SHALLOW WATERS THE CANOES WERE HAILED AND AFTER HAVING GIVEN AN ACCOUNT OF THEMSELVES THEY WERE ASKED IF THEY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THE PIRATE SHIP UPON THE COAST
441-128988-0018 BUT THEIR WAY WAS A VERY DIFFERENT ONE FROM ANY WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED BY THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP THEY ROWED OFF INTO THE DARKNESS INSTEAD OF GOING TOWARD THE TOWN AND WAITED UNTIL NEARLY DAYBREAK THEN THEY BOLDLY MADE FOR THE MAN OF WAR
441-128988-0019 ONE CANOE ATTACKING HER ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER ON THE OTHER BEFORE THE SPANISH COULD COMPREHEND WHAT HAD HAPPENED THERE WERE MORE THAN TWENTY PIRATES UPON THEIR DECKS THE DREADED L'OLONNOIS AT THEIR HEAD
441-128988-0020 AND THEY FOUGHT EACH SCOUNDREL OF THEM LIKE THREE MEN AND THE SAVAGE FIGHT ENDED BY EVERY SPANISH SAILOR OR OFFICER WHO WAS NOT KILLED OR WOUNDED BEING FORCED TO STAY BELOW DECKS WHERE THE HATCHES WERE SECURELY FASTENED DOWN UPON THEM
441-128988-0021 L'OLONNOIS NOW STOOD A PROUD VICTOR ON THE DECK OF HIS PRIZE AND BEING A MAN OF PRINCIPLE HE DETERMINED TO LIVE UP TO THE DISTINGUISHED REPUTATION WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD
441-128988-0022 BARING HIS MUSCULAR AND HAIRY RIGHT ARM HE CLUTCHED THE HANDLE OF HIS SHARP AND HEAVY CUTLASS AND ORDERED THE PRISONERS TO BE BROUGHT UP FROM BELOW ONE AT A TIME AND CONDUCTED TO THE PLACE WHERE HE STOOD
441-128988-0023 HE WISHED TO GIVE SPAIN A LESSON WHICH WOULD MAKE HER UNDERSTAND THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE INTERFERED WITH IN THE EXECUTION OF HIS ENTERPRISES AND HE DETERMINED TO ALLOW HIMSELF THE PLEASURE OF PERSONALLY TEACHING THIS LESSON
441-128988-0024 THIS MAN WHO WAS NOT A SOLDIER WAS DESPERATELY FRIGHTENED AND BEGGED PITEOUSLY FOR HIS LIFE L'OLONNOIS FINDING THAT THE MAN WAS WILLING TO TELL EVERYTHING HE KNEW QUESTIONED HIM ABOUT THE SENDING OF THIS VESSEL FROM HAVANA
441-128988-0025 AND WHEN THE POOR FELLOW HAD FINISHED BY TELLING THAT HE HAD COME THERE NOT OF HIS OWN ACCORD BUT SIMPLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBEYING HIS MASTER TO HANG ALL THE PIRATES EXCEPT THEIR LEADER THAT GREAT BUCCANEER LAUGHED AND FINDING HE COULD GET NOTHING MORE FROM THE NEGRO
441-128988-0026 CUT OFF HIS HEAD LIKEWISE AND HIS BODY WAS TUMBLED INTO THE SEA AFTER THOSE OF HIS COMPANIONS NOW THERE WAS NOT A SPANIARD LEFT ON BOARD THE GREAT SHIP EXCEPT ONE MAN
441-128988-0027 WHO HAD BEEN PRESERVED FROM THE FATE OF THE OTHERS BECAUSE L'OLONNOIS HAD SOME CORRESPONDENCE TO ATTEND TO AND HE NEEDED A MESSENGER TO CARRY A LETTER THE PIRATE CAPTAIN WENT INTO THE CABIN WHERE HE FOUND WRITING MATERIALS READY TO HIS HAND
441-128988-0028 AND THERE HE COMPOSED A LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR OF HAVANA A PART OF WHICH READ AS FOLLOWS I SHALL NEVER HENCEFORWARD GIVE QUARTER UNTO ANY SPANIARD WHATSOEVER
441-128988-0029 WHEN THIS MESSAGE WAS RECEIVED BY THE DIGNIFIED OFFICIAL WHO FILLED THE POST OF GOVERNOR OF CUBA HE STORMED AND FAIRLY FOAMED AT THE MOUTH TO BE UTTERLY FOILED AND DISCOMFITED BY THIS RESURRECTED PIRATE
441-128988-0030 AND TO BE AFTERWARDS ADDRESSED IN TERMS OF SUCH UNHEARD OF INSOLENCE AND ABUSE WAS MORE THAN HE COULD BEAR AND IN THE PRESENCE OF MANY OF HIS OFFICIALS AND ATTENDANTS HE SWORE A TERRIBLE OATH THAT AFTER THAT HOUR HE WOULD NEVER AGAIN GIVE QUARTER TO ANY BUCCANEER
441-128988-0031 BUT WHEN THE INHABITANTS OF HAVANA AND THE SURROUNDING VILLAGES HEARD OF THIS TERRIBLE RESOLUTION OF THEIR GOVERNOR THEY WERE VERY MUCH DISTURBED THEY LIVED IN CONSTANT DANGER OF ATTACK ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO WERE ENGAGED IN FISHING OR MARITIME PURSUITS
441-128988-0032 AND THEY FEARED THAT WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT NO BUCCANEER WAS TO RECEIVE QUARTER THE SPANISH COLONISTS WOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME WAY NO MATTER WHERE THEY MIGHT BE FOUND AND TAKEN
441-128988-0033 CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS REPRESENTED TO THE GOVERNOR THAT HIS PLAN OF VENGEANCE WOULD WORK MOST DISASTROUSLY FOR THE SPANISH SETTLERS FOR THE BUCCANEERS COULD DO FAR MORE DAMAGE TO THEM THAN HE COULD POSSIBLY DO TO THESE DREADFUL BRETHREN OF THE COAST
441-128988-0034 AND THAT UNLESS HE WISHED TO BRING UPON THEM TROUBLES GREATER THAN THOSE OF FAMINE OR PESTILENCE THEY BEGGED THAT HE WOULD RETRACT HIS OATH WHEN THE HIGH DIGNITARY HAD COOLED DOWN A LITTLE HE SAW THAT THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF SENSE IN WHAT THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE HAD SAID TO HIM
441-128988-0035 AND HE ALSO DISCOVERED MUCH TO HIS SURPRISE THAT THERE WERE VERY FEW PROVISIONS ON BOARD FOR WHEN THE VESSEL WAS SENT FROM HAVANA IT WAS SUPPOSED SHE WOULD MAKE BUT A VERY SHORT CRUISE
441-130108-0000 A SPUTTERING OF MUSKETRY WAS ALWAYS TO BE HEARD LATER THE CANNON HAD ENTERED THE DISPUTE IN THE FOG FILLED AIR THEIR VOICES MADE A THUDDING SOUND THE REVERBERATIONS WERE CONTINUAL
441-130108-0001 THIS PART OF THE WORLD LED A STRANGE BATTLEFUL EXISTENCE THE YOUTH'S REGIMENT WAS MARCHED TO RELIEVE A COMMAND THAT HAD LAIN LONG IN SOME DAMP TRENCHES THE MEN TOOK POSITIONS BEHIND A CURVING LINE OF RIFLE PITS THAT HAD BEEN TURNED UP LIKE A LARGE FURROW
441-130108-0002 HE COULD SEE THE LOW LINE OF TRENCHES BUT FOR A SHORT DISTANCE A FEW IDLE FLAGS WERE PERCHED ON THE DIRT HILLS
441-130108-0003 ALWAYS THE NOISE OF SKIRMISHERS CAME FROM THE WOODS ON THE FRONT AND LEFT AND THE DIN ON THE RIGHT HAD GROWN TO FRIGHTFUL PROPORTIONS THE GUNS WERE ROARING WITHOUT AN INSTANT'S PAUSE FOR BREATH
441-130108-0004 IT SEEMED THAT THE CANNON HAD COME FROM ALL PARTS AND WERE ENGAGED IN A STUPENDOUS WRANGLE IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE A SENTENCE HEARD THE YOUTH WISHED TO LAUNCH A JOKE A QUOTATION FROM NEWSPAPERS HE DESIRED TO SAY
441-130108-0005 ALL QUIET ON THE RAPPAHANNOCK BUT THE GUNS REFUSED TO PERMIT EVEN A COMMENT UPON THEIR UPROAR HE NEVER SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDED THE SENTENCE BUT AT LAST THE GUNS STOPPED AND AMONG THE MEN IN THE RIFLE PITS RUMORS AGAIN FLEW
441-130108-0006 LIKE BIRDS BUT THEY WERE NOW FOR THE MOST PART BLACK CREATURES WHO FLAPPED THEIR WINGS DREARILY NEAR TO THE GROUND AND REFUSED TO RISE ON ANY WINGS OF HOPE THE MEN'S FACES GREW DOLEFUL FROM THE INTERPRETING OF OMENS
441-130108-0007 STORIES OF DISASTER WERE BORNE INTO THEIR MINDS WITH MANY PROOFS THIS DIN OF MUSKETRY ON THE RIGHT GROWING LIKE A RELEASED GENIE OF SOUND EXPRESSED AND EMPHASIZED THE ARMY'S PLIGHT THE MEN WERE DISHEARTENED AND BEGAN TO MUTTER
441-130108-0008 AND IT COULD ALWAYS BE SEEN THAT THEY WERE BEWILDERED BY THE ALLEGED NEWS AND COULD NOT FULLY COMPREHEND A DEFEAT BEFORE THE GRAY MISTS HAD BEEN TOTALLY OBLITERATED BY THE SUN RAYS THE REGIMENT WAS MARCHING IN A SPREAD COLUMN THAT WAS RETIRING CAREFULLY THROUGH THE WOODS
441-130108-0009 THE DISORDERED HURRYING LINES OF THE ENEMY COULD SOMETIMES BE SEEN DOWN THROUGH THE GROVES AND LITTLE FIELDS THEY WERE YELLING SHRILL AND EXULTANT AT THIS SIGHT THE YOUTH FORGOT MANY PERSONAL MATTERS AND BECAME GREATLY ENRAGED HE EXPLODED IN LOUD SENTENCES
441-130108-0010 OBSERVED A MAN HIS FRIEND RECENTLY AROUSED WAS STILL VERY DROWSY HE LOOKED BEHIND HIM UNTIL HIS MIND TOOK IN THE MEANING OF THE MOVEMENT THEN HE SIGHED OH WELL I S'POSE WE GOT LICKED
441-130108-0011 HE REMARKED SADLY THE YOUTH HAD A THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD NOT BE HANDSOME FOR HIM TO FREELY CONDEMN OTHER MEN HE MADE AN ATTEMPT TO RESTRAIN HIMSELF BUT THE WORDS UPON HIS TONGUE WERE TOO BITTER
441-130108-0012 HE PRESENTLY BEGAN A LONG AND INTRICATE DENUNCIATION OF THE COMMANDER OF THE FORCES MEBBE IT WA'N'T ALL HIS FAULT NOT ALL TOGETHER
441-130108-0013 IT'S OUR LUCK T GIT LICKED OFTEN SAID HIS FRIEND IN A WEARY TONE HE WAS TRUDGING ALONG WITH STOOPED SHOULDERS AND SHIFTING EYES LIKE A MAN WHO HAS BEEN CANED AND KICKED WELL DON'T WE FIGHT LIKE THE DEVIL
441-130108-0014 DON'T WE DO ALL THAT MEN CAN DEMANDED THE YOUTH LOUDLY HE WAS SECRETLY DUMFOUNDED AT THIS SENTIMENT WHEN IT CAME FROM HIS LIPS FOR A MOMENT HIS FACE LOST ITS VALOR AND HE LOOKED GUILTILY ABOUT HIM
441-130108-0015 BUT NO ONE QUESTIONED HIS RIGHT TO DEAL IN SUCH WORDS AND PRESENTLY HE RECOVERED HIS AIR OF COURAGE HE WENT ON TO REPEAT A STATEMENT HE HAD HEARD GOING FROM GROUP TO GROUP AT THE CAMP THAT MORNING THE BRIGADIER SAID HE NEVER SAW A NEW REG'MENT FIGHT THE WAY WE FOUGHT YESTIRDAY DIDN'T HE
441-130108-0016 IN HIS REPLY THE FRIEND'S VOICE WAS STERN A COURSE NOT HE SAID
441-130108-0017 BUT STILL STILL WE DON'T HAVE NO LUCK WELL THEN IF WE FIGHT LIKE THE DEVIL AN DON'T EVER WHIP IT MUST BE THE GENERAL'S FAULT SAID THE YOUTH GRANDLY AND DECISIVELY
441-130108-0018 AND I DON'T SEE ANY SENSE IN FIGHTING AND FIGHTING AND FIGHTING YET ALWAYS LOSING THROUGH SOME DERNED OLD LUNKHEAD OF A GENERAL
441-130108-0019 THE SPEECH PIERCED THE YOUTH INWARDLY HE WAS REDUCED TO AN ABJECT PULP BY THESE CHANCE WORDS HIS LEGS QUAKED PRIVATELY HE CAST A FRIGHTENED GLANCE AT THE SARCASTIC MAN WHY NO HE HASTENED TO SAY IN A CONCILIATING VOICE
441-130108-0020 I DON'T THINK I FOUGHT THE WHOLE BATTLE YESTERDAY BUT THE OTHER SEEMED INNOCENT OF ANY DEEPER MEANING APPARENTLY HE HAD NO INFORMATION IT WAS MERELY HIS HABIT OH HE REPLIED IN THE SAME TONE OF CALM DERISION
441-130108-0021 THE YOUTH NEVERTHELESS FELT A THREAT HIS MIND SHRANK FROM GOING NEAR TO THE DANGER AND THEREAFTER HE WAS SILENT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SARCASTIC MAN'S WORDS TOOK FROM HIM ALL LOUD MOODS THAT WOULD MAKE HIM APPEAR PROMINENT
441-130108-0022 HE BECAME SUDDENLY A MODEST PERSON THERE WAS LOW TONED TALK AMONG THE TROOPS THE OFFICERS WERE IMPATIENT AND SNAPPY THEIR COUNTENANCES CLOUDED WITH THE TALES OF MISFORTUNE
441-130108-0023 THE TROOPS SIFTING THROUGH THE FOREST WERE SULLEN IN THE YOUTH'S COMPANY ONCE A MAN'S LAUGH RANG OUT A DOZEN SOLDIERS TURNED THEIR FACES QUICKLY TOWARD HIM AND FROWNED WITH VAGUE DISPLEASURE
441-130108-0024 THE NOISE OF FIRING DOGGED THEIR FOOTSTEPS SOMETIMES IT SEEMED TO BE DRIVEN A LITTLE WAY BUT IT ALWAYS RETURNED AGAIN WITH INCREASED INSOLENCE THE MEN MUTTERED AND CURSED THROWING BLACK LOOKS IN ITS DIRECTION
441-130108-0025 IN A CLEAR SPACE THE TROOPS WERE AT LAST HALTED REGIMENTS AND BRIGADES BROKEN AND DETACHED THROUGH THEIR ENCOUNTERS WITH THICKETS GREW TOGETHER AGAIN AND LINES WERE FACED TOWARD THE PURSUING BARK OF THE ENEMY'S INFANTRY
441-130108-0026 INCREASED TO A LOUD AND JOYOUS BURST AND THEN AS THE SUN WENT SERENELY UP THE SKY THROWING ILLUMINATING RAYS INTO THE GLOOMY THICKETS IT BROKE FORTH INTO PROLONGED PEALINGS THE WOODS BEGAN TO CRACKLE AS IF AFIRE
441-130108-0027 SAID A MAN HERE WE ARE EVERYBODY FIGHTIN BLOOD AN DESTRUCTION
441-130108-0028 WHO WERE LYING DOWN BEHIND WHATEVER PROTECTION THEY HAD COLLECTED A BATTERY HAD TRUNDLED INTO POSITION IN THE REAR AND WAS THOUGHTFULLY SHELLING THE DISTANCE THE REGIMENT UNMOLESTED AS YET
441-130108-0029 AWAITED THE MOMENT WHEN THE GRAY SHADOWS OF THE WOODS BEFORE THEM SHOULD BE SLASHED BY THE LINES OF FLAME THERE WAS MUCH GROWLING AND SWEARING GOOD GAWD THE YOUTH GRUMBLED WE'RE ALWAYS BEING CHASED AROUND LIKE RATS IT MAKES ME SICK
441-130108-0030 NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW WHERE WE GO OR WHY WE GO WE JUST GET FIRED AROUND FROM PILLAR TO POST AND GET LICKED HERE AND GET LICKED THERE AND NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT'S DONE FOR IT MAKES A MAN FEEL LIKE A DAMN KITTEN IN A BAG
441-130108-0031 NOW I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE ETERNAL THUNDERS WE WAS MARCHED INTO THESE WOODS FOR ANYHOW UNLESS IT WAS TO GIVE THE REBS A REGULAR POT SHOT AT US WE CAME IN HERE AND GOT OUR LEGS ALL TANGLED UP IN THESE CUSSED BRIERS
441-130108-0032 AND THEN WE BEGIN TO FIGHT AND THE REBS HAD AN EASY TIME OF IT DON'T TELL ME IT'S JUST LUCK I KNOW BETTER IT'S THIS DERNED OLD THE FRIEND SEEMED JADED BUT HE INTERRUPTED HIS COMRADE WITH A VOICE OF CALM CONFIDENCE
441-130108-0033 OH THE DEVIL IT WILL YOU ALWAYS TALK LIKE A DOG HANGED PARSON DON'T TELL ME I KNOW
441-130108-0034 AT THIS TIME THERE WAS AN INTERPOSITION BY THE SAVAGE MINDED LIEUTENANT WHO WAS OBLIGED TO VENT SOME OF HIS INWARD DISSATISFACTION UPON HIS MEN YOU BOYS SHUT RIGHT UP
441-130108-0035 YOU'VE BEEN JAWIN LIKE A LOT A OLD HENS
441-130108-0036 LESS TALKIN AN MORE FIGHTIN IS WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU BOYS I NEVER SAW SECH GABBLING JACKASSES HE PAUSED READY TO POUNCE UPON ANY MAN WHO MIGHT HAVE THE TEMERITY TO REPLY
441-130108-0037 THE DAY HAD GROWN MORE WHITE UNTIL THE SUN SHED HIS FULL RADIANCE UPON THE THRONGED FOREST A SORT OF A GUST OF BATTLE CAME SWEEPING TOWARD THAT PART OF THE LINE WHERE LAY THE YOUTH'S REGIMENT THE FRONT SHIFTED A TRIFLE TO MEET IT SQUARELY
441-130108-0038 THERE WAS A WAIT IN THIS PART OF THE FIELD THERE PASSED SLOWLY THE INTENSE MOMENTS THAT PRECEDE THE TEMPEST A SINGLE RIFLE FLASHED IN A THICKET BEFORE THE REGIMENT IN AN INSTANT IT WAS JOINED BY MANY OTHERS
441-130108-0039 THERE WAS A MIGHTY SONG OF CLASHES AND CRASHES THAT WENT SWEEPING THROUGH THE WOODS THE GUNS IN THE REAR AROUSED AND ENRAGED BY SHELLS THAT HAD BEEN THROWN BURR LIKE AT THEM SUDDENLY INVOLVED THEMSELVES IN A HIDEOUS ALTERCATION WITH ANOTHER BAND OF GUNS
441-130108-0040 THE BATTLE ROAR SETTLED TO A ROLLING THUNDER WHICH WAS A SINGLE LONG EXPLOSION IN THE REGIMENT THERE WAS A PECULIAR KIND OF HESITATION DENOTED IN THE ATTITUDES OF THE MEN
441-130108-0041 THEY WERE WORN EXHAUSTED HAVING SLEPT BUT LITTLE AND LABORED MUCH
445-123857-0000 SOME GLORY IN THEIR BIRTH SOME IN THEIR SKILL SOME IN THEIR WEALTH SOME IN THEIR BODY'S FORCE SOME IN THEIR GARMENTS THOUGH NEW FANGLED ILL
445-123857-0001 SOME IN THEIR HAWKS AND HOUNDS SOME IN THEIR HORSE AND EVERY HUMOUR HATH HIS ADJUNCT PLEASURE WHEREIN IT FINDS A JOY ABOVE THE REST BUT THESE PARTICULARS ARE NOT MY MEASURE
445-123857-0002 ALL THESE I BETTER IN ONE GENERAL BEST THY LOVE IS BETTER THAN HIGH BIRTH TO ME RICHER THAN WEALTH PROUDER THAN GARMENTS COSTS
445-123857-0003 SINCE THAT MY LIFE ON THY REVOLT DOTH LIE
445-123857-0004 HAPPY TO HAVE THY LOVE HAPPY TO DIE
445-123857-0005 THY LOOKS WITH ME THY HEART IN OTHER PLACE FOR THERE CAN LIVE NO HATRED IN THINE EYE THEREFORE IN THAT I CANNOT KNOW THY CHANGE
445-123857-0006 IN MANY'S LOOKS THE FALSE HEART'S HISTORY IS WRIT IN MOODS AND FROWNS AND WRINKLES STRANGE BUT HEAVEN IN THY CREATION DID DECREE THAT IN THY FACE SWEET LOVE SHOULD EVER DWELL
445-123857-0007 WHATE'ER THY THOUGHTS OR THY HEART'S WORKINGS BE
445-123857-0008 HOW LIKE EVE'S APPLE DOTH THY BEAUTY GROW IF THY SWEET VIRTUE ANSWER NOT THY SHOW
445-123857-0009 AND WILL DO NONE THAT DO NOT DO THE THING THEY MOST DO SHOW WHO MOVING OTHERS ARE THEMSELVES AS STONE
445-123857-0010 THEY RIGHTLY DO INHERIT HEAVEN'S GRACES AND HUSBAND NATURE'S RICHES FROM EXPENSE THEY ARE THE LORDS AND OWNERS OF THEIR FACES OTHERS BUT STEWARDS OF THEIR EXCELLENCE
445-123857-0011 THE SUMMER'S FLOWER IS TO THE SUMMER SWEET THOUGH TO ITSELF IT ONLY LIVE AND DIE BUT IF THAT FLOWER WITH BASE INFECTION MEET THE BASEST WEED
445-123857-0012 OUTBRAVES HIS DIGNITY FOR SWEETEST THINGS TURN SOUREST BY THEIR DEEDS LILIES THAT FESTER SMELL FAR WORSE THAN WEEDS
445-123857-0013 WHICH LIKE A CANKER IN THE FRAGRANT ROSE DOTH SPOT THE BEAUTY OF THY BUDDING NAME
445-123857-0014 THAT TONGUE THAT TELLS THE STORY OF THY DAYS MAKING LASCIVIOUS COMMENTS ON THY SPORT CANNOT DISPRAISE BUT IN A KIND OF PRAISE NAMING THY NAME BLESSES AN ILL REPORT
445-123857-0015 O WHAT A MANSION HAVE THOSE VICES GOT WHICH FOR THEIR HABITATION CHOSE OUT THEE WHERE BEAUTY'S VEIL DOTH COVER EVERY BLOT AND ALL THINGS TURNS TO FAIR THAT EYES CAN SEE
445-123857-0016 TAKE HEED DEAR HEART OF THIS LARGE PRIVILEGE
445-123857-0017 SOME SAY THY GRACE IS YOUTH AND GENTLE SPORT BOTH GRACE AND FAULTS ARE LOV'D OF MORE AND LESS
445-123857-0018 WHAT OLD DECEMBER'S BARENESS EVERYWHERE AND YET THIS TIME REMOVED WAS SUMMER'S TIME THE TEEMING AUTUMN BIG WITH RICH INCREASE BEARING THE WANTON BURDEN OF THE PRIME
445-123857-0019 LIKE WIDOW'D WOMBS AFTER THEIR LORDS DECEASE YET THIS ABUNDANT ISSUE SEEM'D TO ME BUT HOPE OF ORPHANS AND UNFATHER'D FRUIT FOR SUMMER AND HIS PLEASURES WAIT ON THEE
445-123857-0020 AND THOU AWAY THE VERY BIRDS ARE MUTE OR IF THEY SING TIS WITH SO DULL A CHEER THAT LEAVES LOOK PALE DREADING THE WINTER'S NEAR
445-123857-0021 FROM YOU HAVE I BEEN ABSENT IN THE SPRING WHEN PROUD PIED APRIL DRESS'D IN ALL HIS TRIM HATH PUT A SPIRIT OF YOUTH IN EVERY THING
445-123857-0022 YET NOR THE LAYS OF BIRDS NOR THE SWEET SMELL OF DIFFERENT FLOWERS IN ODOUR AND IN HUE COULD MAKE ME ANY SUMMER'S STORY TELL OR FROM THEIR PROUD LAP PLUCK THEM WHERE THEY GREW
445-123857-0023 NOR DID I WONDER AT THE LILY'S WHITE NOR PRAISE THE DEEP VERMILION IN THE ROSE THEY WERE BUT SWEET BUT FIGURES OF DELIGHT DRAWN AFTER YOU YOU PATTERN OF ALL THOSE
445-123857-0024 YET SEEM'D IT WINTER STILL AND YOU AWAY AS WITH YOUR SHADOW I WITH THESE DID PLAY
445-123857-0025 THE FORWARD VIOLET THUS DID I CHIDE SWEET THIEF WHENCE DIDST THOU STEAL THY SWEET THAT SMELLS IF NOT FROM MY LOVE'S BREATH
445-123857-0026 THE PURPLE PRIDE WHICH ON THY SOFT CHEEK FOR COMPLEXION DWELLS IN MY LOVE'S VEINS THOU HAST TOO GROSSLY DY'D
445-123857-0027 THE ROSES FEARFULLY ON THORNS DID STAND ONE BLUSHING SHAME ANOTHER WHITE DESPAIR A THIRD NOR RED NOR WHITE HAD STOL'N OF BOTH AND TO HIS ROBBERY HAD ANNEX'D THY BREATH
445-123857-0028 BUT FOR HIS THEFT IN PRIDE OF ALL HIS GROWTH A VENGEFUL CANKER EAT HIM UP TO DEATH
445-123857-0029 WHERE ART THOU MUSE THAT THOU FORGET'ST SO LONG TO SPEAK OF THAT WHICH GIVES THEE ALL THY MIGHT SPEND'ST THOU THY FURY ON SOME WORTHLESS SONG
445-123857-0030 DARKENING THY POWER TO LEND BASE SUBJECTS LIGHT RETURN FORGETFUL MUSE AND STRAIGHT REDEEM IN GENTLE NUMBERS TIME SO IDLY SPENT
445-123857-0031 SING TO THE EAR THAT DOTH THY LAYS ESTEEM AND GIVES THY PEN BOTH SKILL AND ARGUMENT
445-123857-0032 MY LOVE'S SWEET FACE SURVEY IF TIME HAVE ANY WRINKLE GRAVEN THERE IF ANY BE A SATIRE TO DECAY
445-123860-0000 TIS BETTER TO BE VILE THAN VILE ESTEEM'D WHEN NOT TO BE RECEIVES REPROACH OF BEING AND THE JUST PLEASURE LOST WHICH IS SO DEEM'D NOT BY OUR FEELING BUT BY OTHERS SEEING
445-123860-0001 FOR WHY SHOULD OTHERS FALSE ADULTERATE EYES GIVE SALUTATION TO MY SPORTIVE BLOOD OR ON MY FRAILTIES WHY ARE FRAILER SPIES WHICH IN THEIR WILLS COUNT BAD WHAT I THINK GOOD
445-123860-0002 NO I AM THAT I AM AND THEY THAT LEVEL AT MY ABUSES RECKON UP THEIR OWN I MAY BE STRAIGHT THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES BE BEVEL
445-123860-0003 BY THEIR RANK THOUGHTS MY DEEDS MUST NOT BE SHOWN UNLESS THIS GENERAL EVIL THEY MAINTAIN ALL MEN ARE BAD AND IN THEIR BADNESS REIGN
445-123860-0004 WHICH SHALL ABOVE THAT IDLE RANK REMAIN BEYOND ALL DATE EVEN TO ETERNITY OR AT THE LEAST SO LONG AS BRAIN AND HEART HAVE FACULTY BY NATURE TO SUBSIST
445-123860-0005 THY RECORD NEVER CAN BE MISS'D THAT POOR RETENTION COULD NOT SO MUCH HOLD NOR NEED I TALLIES THY DEAR LOVE TO SCORE THEREFORE TO GIVE THEM FROM ME WAS I BOLD
445-123860-0006 THEY ARE BUT DRESSINGS OF A FORMER SIGHT OUR DATES ARE BRIEF AND THEREFORE WE ADMIRE WHAT THOU DOST FOIST UPON US THAT IS OLD AND RATHER MAKE THEM BORN TO OUR DESIRE THAN THINK THAT WE BEFORE HAVE HEARD THEM TOLD
445-123860-0007 THY REGISTERS AND THEE I BOTH DEFY NOT WONDERING AT THE PRESENT NOR THE PAST FOR THY RECORDS AND WHAT WE SEE DOTH LIE
445-123860-0008 IT SUFFERS NOT IN SMILING POMP NOR FALLS UNDER THE BLOW OF THRALLED DISCONTENT
445-123860-0009 IT FEARS NOT POLICY THAT HERETIC WHICH WORKS ON LEASES OF SHORT NUMBER'D HOURS BUT ALL ALONE STANDS HUGELY POLITIC THAT IT NOR GROWS WITH HEAT NOR DROWNS WITH SHOWERS TO THIS I WITNESS CALL
445-123860-0010 THE FOOLS OF TIME WHICH DIE FOR GOODNESS WHO HAVE LIVED FOR CRIME
445-123860-0011 WERE'T AUGHT TO ME I BORE THE CANOPY WITH MY EXTERN THE OUTWARD HONOURING OR LAID GREAT BASES FOR ETERNITY WHICH PROVES MORE SHORT THAN WASTE OR RUINING
445-123860-0012 HAVE I NOT SEEN DWELLERS ON FORM AND FAVOUR LOSE ALL AND MORE BY PAYING TOO MUCH RENT FOR COMPOUND SWEET FORGOING SIMPLE SAVOUR PITIFUL THRIVERS IN THEIR GAZING SPENT NO
445-123860-0013 LET ME BE OBSEQUIOUS IN THY HEART AND TAKE THOU MY OBLATION POOR BUT FREE WHICH IS NOT MIX'D WITH SECONDS KNOWS NO ART BUT MUTUAL RENDER ONLY ME FOR THEE HENCE THOU SUBORNED INFORMER
445-123860-0014 A TRUE SOUL WHEN MOST IMPEACH'D STANDS LEAST IN THY CONTROL
445-123860-0015 O THOU MY LOVELY BOY WHO IN THY POWER DOST HOLD TIME'S FICKLE GLASS HIS FICKLE HOUR WHO HAST BY WANING GROWN
445-123860-0016 IF NATURE SOVEREIGN MISTRESS OVER WRACK AS THOU GOEST ONWARDS STILL WILL PLUCK THEE BACK SHE KEEPS THEE TO THIS PURPOSE
445-123860-0017 BUT NOW IS BLACK BEAUTY'S SUCCESSIVE HEIR AND BEAUTY SLANDER'D WITH A BASTARD SHAME FOR SINCE EACH HAND HATH PUT ON NATURE'S POWER FAIRING THE FOUL WITH ART'S FALSE BORROWED FACE
445-123860-0018 SWEET BEAUTY HATH NO NAME NO HOLY BOWER BUT IS PROFAN'D IF NOT LIVES IN DISGRACE
445-123860-0019 AND THEY MOURNERS SEEM AT SUCH WHO NOT BORN FAIR NO BEAUTY LACK SLAND'RING CREATION WITH A FALSE ESTEEM YET SO THEY MOURN
445-123860-0020 WHILST MY POOR LIPS WHICH SHOULD THAT HARVEST REAP AT THE WOOD'S BOLDNESS BY THEE BLUSHING STAND TO BE SO TICKLED THEY WOULD CHANGE THEIR STATE AND SITUATION WITH THOSE DANCING CHIPS O'ER WHOM THY FINGERS WALK WITH GENTLE GAIT
445-123860-0021 MURDEROUS BLOODY FULL OF BLAME SAVAGE EXTREME RUDE CRUEL NOT TO TRUST ENJOY'D NO SOONER BUT DESPISED STRAIGHT PAST REASON HUNTED
445-123860-0022 AND NO SOONER HAD PAST REASON HATED AS A SWALLOW'D BAIT ON PURPOSE LAID TO MAKE THE TAKER MAD MAD IN PURSUIT AND IN POSSESSION SO HAD HAVING AND IN QUEST TO HAVE
445-123860-0023 EXTREME A BLISS IN PROOF
445-123860-0024 IF SNOW BE WHITE WHY THEN HER BREASTS ARE DUN IF HAIRS BE WIRES BLACK WIRES GROW ON HER HEAD I HAVE SEEN ROSES DAMASK'D RED AND WHITE
445-123860-0025 BUT NO SUCH ROSES SEE I IN HER CHEEKS AND IN SOME PERFUMES IS THERE MORE DELIGHT THAN IN THE BREATH THAT FROM MY MISTRESS REEKS I LOVE TO HEAR HER SPEAK
445-123860-0026 YET WELL I KNOW THAT MUSIC HATH A FAR MORE PLEASING SOUND I GRANT I NEVER SAW A GODDESS GO MY MISTRESS WHEN SHE WALKS TREADS ON THE GROUND
446-123501-0000 CHAPTER THREE MY ADVENT ON MARS I OPENED MY EYES UPON A STRANGE AND WEIRD LANDSCAPE I KNEW THAT I WAS ON MARS NOT ONCE DID I QUESTION EITHER MY SANITY OR MY WAKEFULNESS
446-123501-0001 I WAS NOT ASLEEP NO NEED FOR PINCHING HERE MY INNER CONSCIOUSNESS TOLD ME AS PLAINLY THAT I WAS UPON MARS AS YOUR CONSCIOUS MIND TELLS YOU THAT YOU ARE UPON EARTH YOU DO NOT QUESTION THE FACT
446-123501-0002 NEITHER DID I I FOUND MYSELF LYING PRONE UPON A BED OF YELLOWISH MOSSLIKE VEGETATION WHICH STRETCHED AROUND ME IN ALL DIRECTIONS FOR INTERMINABLE MILES I SEEMED TO BE LYING IN A DEEP
446-123501-0003 THE IRREGULARITIES OF LOW HILLS IT WAS MIDDAY THE SUN WAS SHINING FULL UPON ME AND THE HEAT OF IT WAS RATHER INTENSE UPON MY NAKED BODY YET NO GREATER
446-123501-0004 THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN TRUE UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS ON AN ARIZONA DESERT HERE AND THERE WERE SLIGHT OUTCROPPINGS OF QUARTZ BEARING ROCK WHICH GLISTENED IN THE SUNLIGHT AND A LITTLE TO MY LEFT PERHAPS A HUNDRED YARDS APPEARED A LOW WALLED ENCLOSURE
446-123501-0005 ABOUT FOUR FEET IN HEIGHT NO WATER AND NO OTHER VEGETATION THAN THE MOSS WAS IN EVIDENCE AND AS I WAS SOMEWHAT THIRSTY I DETERMINED TO DO A LITTLE EXPLORING SPRINGING TO MY FEET I RECEIVED MY FIRST MARTIAN SURPRISE
446-123501-0006 FOR THE EFFORT WHICH ON EARTH WOULD HAVE BROUGHT ME STANDING UPRIGHT CARRIED ME INTO THE MARTIAN AIR TO THE HEIGHT OF ABOUT THREE YARDS I ALIGHTED SOFTLY UPON THE GROUND HOWEVER WITHOUT APPRECIABLE SHOCK OR JAR
446-123501-0007 NOW COMMENCED A SERIES OF EVOLUTIONS WHICH EVEN THEN SEEMED LUDICROUS IN THE EXTREME I FOUND THAT I MUST LEARN TO WALK ALL OVER AGAIN
446-123501-0008 AS THE MUSCULAR EXERTION WHICH CARRIED ME EASILY AND SAFELY UPON EARTH PLAYED STRANGE ANTICS WITH ME UPON MARS INSTEAD OF PROGRESSING IN A SANE AND DIGNIFIED MANNER
446-123501-0009 MY ATTEMPTS TO WALK RESULTED IN A VARIETY OF HOPS WHICH TOOK ME CLEAR OF THE GROUND A COUPLE OF FEET AT EACH STEP AND LANDED ME SPRAWLING UPON MY FACE OR BACK
446-123501-0010 MY MUSCLES PERFECTLY ATTUNED AND ACCUSTOMED TO THE FORCE OF GRAVITY ON EARTH PLAYED THE MISCHIEF WITH ME IN ATTEMPTING FOR THE FIRST TIME TO COPE WITH THE LESSER GRAVITATION AND LOWER AIR PRESSURE ON MARS
446-123501-0011 I WAS DETERMINED HOWEVER TO EXPLORE THE LOW STRUCTURE WHICH WAS THE ONLY EVIDENCE OF HABITATION IN SIGHT
446-123501-0012 IT HAD EVER BEEN GIVEN ME TO SEE THE ROOF OF THE ENCLOSURE WAS OF SOLID GLASS
446-123501-0013 AND BENEATH THIS WERE SEVERAL HUNDRED LARGE EGGS PERFECTLY ROUND AND SNOWY WHITE THE EGGS WERE NEARLY UNIFORM IN SIZE BEING ABOUT TWO AND ONE HALF FEET IN DIAMETER FIVE OR SIX HAD ALREADY HATCHED
446-123501-0014 AND THE GROTESQUE CARICATURES WHICH SAT BLINKING IN THE SUNLIGHT WERE ENOUGH TO CAUSE ME TO DOUBT MY SANITY THEY SEEMED MOSTLY HEAD WITH LITTLE SCRAWNY BODIES LONG NECKS AND SIX LEGS OR
446-123501-0015 AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED TWO LEGS AND TWO ARMS WITH AN INTERMEDIARY PAIR OF LIMBS WHICH COULD BE USED AT WILL EITHER AS ARMS OR LEGS THEIR EYES WERE SET AT THE EXTREME SIDES OF THEIR HEADS A TRIFLE ABOVE THE CENTER
446-123501-0016 WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF TURNING THE HEAD THE EARS WHICH WERE SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE EYES AND CLOSER TOGETHER WERE SMALL CUP SHAPED ANTENNAE PROTRUDING NOT MORE THAN AN INCH ON THESE YOUNG SPECIMENS
446-123501-0017 THEIR NOSES WERE BUT LONGITUDINAL SLITS IN THE CENTER OF THEIR FACES MIDWAY BETWEEN THEIR MOUTHS AND EARS THERE WAS NO HAIR ON THEIR BODIES
446-123501-0018 THESE LATTER ADD A MOST FEROCIOUS APPEARANCE TO AN OTHERWISE FEARSOME AND TERRIBLE COUNTENANCE AS THE LOWER TUSKS CURVE UPWARD TO SHARP POINTS WHICH END ABOUT WHERE THE EYES OF EARTHLY HUMAN BEINGS ARE LOCATED
446-123501-0019 THE WHITENESS OF THE TEETH IS NOT THAT OF IVORY BUT OF THE SNOWIEST AND MOST GLEAMING OF CHINA AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND OF THEIR OLIVE SKINS THEIR TUSKS STAND OUT IN A MOST STRIKING MANNER
446-123501-0020 MAKING THESE WEAPONS PRESENT A SINGULARLY FORMIDABLE APPEARANCE MOST OF THESE DETAILS I NOTED LATER FOR I WAS GIVEN BUT LITTLE TIME TO SPECULATE ON THE WONDERS OF MY NEW DISCOVERY
446-123501-0021 ON SUCH A LITTLE THING MY LIFE HUNG THAT I OFTEN MARVEL THAT I ESCAPED SO EASILY HAD NOT THE RIFLE OF THE LEADER OF THE PARTY SWUNG FROM ITS FASTENINGS BESIDE HIS SADDLE IN SUCH A WAY
446-123501-0022 AS TO STRIKE AGAINST THE BUTT OF HIS GREAT METAL SHOD SPEAR I SHOULD HAVE SNUFFED OUT WITHOUT EVER KNOWING THAT DEATH WAS NEAR ME BUT THE LITTLE SOUND CAUSED ME TO TURN
446-123501-0023 AND THERE UPON ME NOT TEN FEET FROM MY BREAST WAS THE POINT OF THAT HUGE SPEAR A SPEAR FORTY FEET LONG TIPPED WITH GLEAMING METAL AND HELD LOW AT THE SIDE OF A MOUNTED REPLICA
446-123501-0024 OF THE LITTLE DEVILS I HAD BEEN WATCHING BUT HOW PUNY AND HARMLESS THEY NOW LOOKED BESIDE THIS HUGE AND TERRIFIC INCARNATION OF HATE OF VENGEANCE AND OF DEATH
446-123501-0025 WAS FULLY FIFTEEN FEET IN HEIGHT
446-123501-0026 HE SAT HIS MOUNT AS WE SIT A HORSE GRASPING THE ANIMAL'S BARREL WITH HIS LOWER LIMBS WHILE THE HANDS OF HIS TWO RIGHT ARMS HELD HIS IMMENSE SPEAR LOW AT THE SIDE OF HIS MOUNT
446-123501-0027 HIS TWO LEFT ARMS WERE OUTSTRETCHED LATERALLY TO HELP PRESERVE HIS BALANCE THE THING HE RODE HAVING NEITHER BRIDLE OR REINS OF ANY DESCRIPTION FOR GUIDANCE AND HIS MOUNT
446-123501-0028 HOW CAN EARTHLY WORDS DESCRIBE IT IT TOWERED TEN FEET AT THE SHOULDER HAD FOUR LEGS ON EITHER SIDE A BROAD FLAT TAIL LARGER AT THE TIP THAN AT THE ROOT AND WHICH IT HELD
446-123501-0029 STRAIGHT OUT BEHIND WHILE RUNNING A GAPING MOUTH WHICH SPLIT ITS HEAD FROM ITS SNOUT TO ITS LONG MASSIVE NECK LIKE ITS MASTER IT WAS ENTIRELY DEVOID OF HAIR
446-123501-0030 ITS BELLY WAS WHITE AND ITS LEGS SHADED FROM THE SLATE OF ITS SHOULDERS AND HIPS TO A VIVID YELLOW AT THE FEET THE FEET THEMSELVES WERE HEAVILY PADDED AND NAILLESS
446-123501-0031 WHICH FACT HAD ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE NOISELESSNESS OF THEIR APPROACH AND IN COMMON WITH A MULTIPLICITY OF LEGS IS A CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF THE FAUNA OF MARS THE HIGHEST TYPE OF MAN
446-123501-0032 AND ONE OTHER ANIMAL THE ONLY MAMMAL EXISTING ON MARS ALONE HAVE WELL FORMED NAILS AND THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO HOOFED ANIMALS IN EXISTENCE THERE BEHIND THIS FIRST CHARGING DEMON
446-123501-0033 TRAILED NINETEEN OTHERS SIMILAR IN ALL RESPECTS BUT AS I LEARNED LATER BEARING INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS PECULIAR TO THEMSELVES PRECISELY
446-123501-0034 AS NO TWO OF US ARE IDENTICAL ALTHOUGH WE ARE ALL CAST IN A SIMILAR MOLD THIS PICTURE OR RATHER MATERIALIZED NIGHTMARE WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED AT LENGTH
446-123501-0035 AS I TURNED TO MEET IT UNARMED AND NAKED AS I WAS THE FIRST LAW OF NATURE MANIFESTED ITSELF IN THE ONLY POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF MY IMMEDIATE PROBLEM AND THAT WAS TO GET OUT OF THE VICINITY
446-123501-0036 OF THE POINT OF THE CHARGING SPEAR CONSEQUENTLY I GAVE A VERY EARTHLY AND AT THE SAME TIME SUPERHUMAN LEAP TO REACH THE TOP OF THE MARTIAN INCUBATOR FOR SUCH I HAD DETERMINED IT MUST BE
446-123501-0037 MY EFFORT WAS CROWNED WITH A SUCCESS WHICH APPALLED ME NO LESS THAN IT SEEMED TO SURPRISE THE MARTIAN WARRIORS FOR IT CARRIED ME FULLY THIRTY FEET INTO THE AIR AND LANDED ME A HUNDRED FEET
446-123501-0038 FROM MY PURSUERS AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ENCLOSURE I ALIGHTED UPON THE SOFT MOSS EASILY AND WITHOUT MISHAP AND TURNING SAW MY ENEMIES LINED UP ALONG THE FURTHER WALL
446-123501-0039 SOME WERE SURVEYING ME WITH EXPRESSIONS WHICH I AFTERWARD DISCOVERED MARKED EXTREME ASTONISHMENT AND THE OTHERS WERE EVIDENTLY SATISFYING THEMSELVES THAT I HAD NOT MOLESTED THEIR YOUNG
446-123501-0040 THEY WERE CONVERSING TOGETHER IN LOW TONES AND GESTICULATING AND POINTING TOWARD ME THEIR DISCOVERY THAT I HAD NOT HARMED THE LITTLE MARTIANS AND THAT I WAS UNARMED MUST HAVE CAUSED THEM
446-123501-0041 TO LOOK UPON ME WITH LESS FEROCITY BUT AS I WAS TO LEARN LATER THE THING WHICH WEIGHED MOST IN MY FAVOR WAS MY EXHIBITION OF HURDLING WHILE THE MARTIANS ARE IMMENSE THEIR BONES ARE VERY LARGE
446-123501-0042 AND I DOUBT THAT WERE ONE OF THEM SUDDENLY TO BE TRANSPORTED TO EARTH HE COULD LIFT HIS OWN WEIGHT FROM THE GROUND IN FACT I AM CONVINCED THAT HE COULD NOT DO SO MY FEAT THEN WAS AS MARVELOUS UPON MARS
446-123501-0043 AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UPON EARTH AND FROM DESIRING TO ANNIHILATE ME THEY SUDDENLY LOOKED UPON ME AS A WONDERFUL DISCOVERY TO BE CAPTURED AND EXHIBITED AMONG THEIR FELLOWS THE RESPITE
446-123501-0044 WITH WHICH WE ARE FAMILIAR THE WEIGHT OF THESE RIFLES IS COMPARATIVELY LITTLE AND WITH THE SMALL CALIBER EXPLOSIVE RADIUM PROJECTILES WHICH THEY USE AND THE GREAT LENGTH OF THE BARREL
446-123501-0045 THEY ARE DEADLY IN THE EXTREME
446-123501-0046 WHICH WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE ON EARTH THE THEORETIC EFFECTIVE RADIUS OF THIS RIFLE IS THREE HUNDRED MILES BUT THE BEST THEY CAN DO IN ACTUAL SERVICE
446-123501-0047 WHEN EQUIPPED WITH THEIR WIRELESS FINDERS AND SIGHTERS IS BUT A TRIFLE OVER TWO HUNDRED MILES THIS IS QUITE FAR ENOUGH TO IMBUE ME WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR THE MARTIAN FIREARM
446-123501-0048 AND SOME TELEPATHIC FORCE MUST HAVE WARNED ME AGAINST AN ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT FROM UNDER THE MUZZLES OF TWENTY OF THESE DEATH DEALING MACHINES
446-123501-0049 WHEN THEY HAD COVERED PERHAPS TWO HUNDRED YARDS THEY HALTED AND TURNING THEIR MOUNTS TOWARD US SAT WATCHING THE WARRIOR BY THE ENCLOSURE HE WAS THE ONE WHOSE SPEAR HAD SO NEARLY TRANSFIXED ME
446-123501-0050 AND CAME AROUND THE END OF THE INCUBATOR TOWARD ME ENTIRELY UNARMED AND AS NAKED AS I EXCEPT FOR THE ORNAMENTS STRAPPED UPON HIS HEAD LIMBS AND BREAST
446-123501-0051 WHEN HE WAS WITHIN ABOUT FIFTY FEET OF ME HE UNCLASPED AN ENORMOUS METAL ARMLET AND HOLDING IT TOWARD ME IN THE OPEN PALM OF HIS HAND ADDRESSED ME IN A CLEAR RESONANT VOICE
446-123501-0052 HE THEN STOPPED AS THOUGH WAITING FOR MY REPLY PRICKING UP HIS ANTENNAE LIKE EARS AND COCKING HIS STRANGE LOOKING EYES STILL FURTHER TOWARD ME AS THE SILENCE BECAME PAINFUL
446-123501-0053 I CONCLUDED TO HAZARD A LITTLE CONVERSATION ON MY OWN PART AS I HAD GUESSED THAT HE WAS MAKING OVERTURES OF PEACE THE THROWING DOWN OF HIS WEAPONS AND THE WITHDRAWING OF HIS TROOP BEFORE HIS ADVANCE TOWARD ME
446-123501-0054 SO WHY NOT THEN ON MARS PLACING MY HAND OVER MY HEART I BOWED LOW TO THE MARTIAN AND EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT WHILE I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIS LANGUAGE
446-123501-0055 HIS ACTIONS SPOKE FOR THE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP THAT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT WERE MOST DEAR TO MY HEART OF COURSE I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BABBLING BROOK FOR ALL THE INTELLIGENCE MY SPEECH CARRIED TO HIM
446-123501-0056 BUT HE UNDERSTOOD THE ACTION WITH WHICH I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED MY WORDS STRETCHING MY HAND TOWARD HIM I ADVANCED AND TOOK THE ARMLET FROM HIS OPEN PALM CLASPING IT ABOUT MY ARM ABOVE THE ELBOW
446-123501-0057 SMILED AT HIM AND STOOD WAITING HIS WIDE MOUTH SPREAD INTO AN ANSWERING SMILE AND LOCKING ONE OF HIS INTERMEDIARY ARMS IN MINE WE TURNED AND WALKED BACK TOWARD HIS MOUNT
446-123501-0058 AT THE SAME TIME HE MOTIONED HIS FOLLOWERS TO ADVANCE THEY STARTED TOWARD US ON A WILD RUN
446-123501-0059 EVIDENTLY HE FEARED THAT WERE I TO BE REALLY FRIGHTENED AGAIN I MIGHT JUMP ENTIRELY OUT OF THE LANDSCAPE HE EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS WITH HIS MEN MOTIONED TO ME THAT I WOULD RIDE BEHIND ONE OF THEM AND THEN MOUNTED HIS OWN ANIMAL
446-123501-0060 THE FELLOW DESIGNATED REACHED DOWN TWO OR THREE HANDS AND LIFTED ME UP BEHIND HIM ON THE GLOSSY BACK OF HIS MOUNT
446-123502-0000 CHAPTER FOUR A PRISONER WE HAD GONE PERHAPS TEN MILES WHEN THE GROUND BEGAN TO RISE VERY RAPIDLY WE WERE AS I WAS LATER TO LEARN NEARING THE EDGE OF ONE OF MARS LONG DEAD SEAS IN THE BOTTOM OF WHICH
446-123502-0001 MY ENCOUNTER WITH THE MARTIANS HAD TAKEN PLACE IN A SHORT TIME WE GAINED THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS AND AFTER TRAVERSING A NARROW GORGE CAME TO AN OPEN VALLEY AT THE FAR EXTREMITY OF WHICH WAS A LOW TABLE LAND UPON WHICH I BEHELD
446-123502-0002 AN ENORMOUS CITY TOWARD THIS WE GALLOPED ENTERING IT BY WHAT APPEARED TO BE A RUINED ROADWAY LEADING OUT FROM THE CITY BUT ONLY TO THE EDGE OF THE TABLE LAND WHERE IT ENDED ABRUPTLY IN A FLIGHT OF BROAD STEPS
446-123502-0003 UPON CLOSER OBSERVATION I SAW AS WE PASSED THEM THAT THE BUILDINGS WERE DESERTED AND WHILE NOT GREATLY DECAYED HAD THE APPEARANCE OF NOT HAVING BEEN TENANTED FOR YEARS POSSIBLY FOR AGES
446-123502-0004 TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE CITY WAS A LARGE PLAZA AND UPON THIS AND IN THE BUILDINGS IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING IT WERE CAMPED SOME NINE OR TEN HUNDRED CREATURES OF THE SAME BREED AS MY CAPTORS
446-123502-0005 FOR SUCH I NOW CONSIDERED THEM DESPITE THE SUAVE MANNER IN WHICH I HAD BEEN TRAPPED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THEIR ORNAMENTS ALL WERE NAKED THE WOMEN VARIED IN APPEARANCE BUT LITTLE FROM THE MEN EXCEPT THAT THEIR TUSKS WERE MUCH LARGER IN PROPORTION TO THEIR HEIGHT
446-123502-0006 IN SOME INSTANCES CURVING NEARLY TO THEIR HIGH SET EARS THEIR BODIES WERE SMALLER AND LIGHTER IN COLOR AND THEIR FINGERS AND TOES BORE THE RUDIMENTS OF NAILS WHICH WERE ENTIRELY LACKING AMONG THE MALES
446-123502-0007 THE ADULT FEMALES RANGED IN HEIGHT FROM TEN TO TWELVE FEET THE CHILDREN WERE LIGHT IN COLOR EVEN LIGHTER THAN THE WOMEN AND ALL LOOKED PRECISELY ALIKE TO ME EXCEPT THAT SOME WERE TALLER
446-123502-0008 WHICH LEADS NO LIVING MARTIAN KNOWS WHITHER AND FROM WHOSE BOSOM NO MARTIAN HAS EVER RETURNED OR WOULD BE ALLOWED TO LIVE DID HE RETURN AFTER ONCE EMBARKING UPON ITS COLD DARK WATERS
446-123502-0009 ONLY ABOUT ONE MARTIAN IN A THOUSAND DIES OF SICKNESS OR DISEASE AND POSSIBLY ABOUT TWENTY TAKE THE VOLUNTARY PILGRIMAGE THE OTHER NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE DIE VIOLENT DEATHS IN DUELS IN HUNTING
446-123502-0010 IN AVIATION AND IN WAR BUT PERHAPS BY FAR THE GREATEST DEATH LOSS COMES DURING THE AGE OF CHILDHOOD WHEN VAST NUMBERS OF THE LITTLE MARTIANS FALL VICTIMS TO THE GREAT WHITE APES OF MARS
446-123502-0011 THE AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF A MARTIAN AFTER THE AGE OF MATURITY IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YEARS BUT WOULD BE NEARER THE ONE THOUSAND MARK WERE IT NOT FOR THE VARIOUS MEANS LEADING TO VIOLENT DEATH
446-123502-0012 OWING TO THE WANING RESOURCES OF THE PLANET IT EVIDENTLY BECAME NECESSARY TO COUNTERACT THE INCREASING LONGEVITY WHICH THEIR REMARKABLE SKILL IN THERAPEUTICS AND SURGERY PRODUCED
446-123502-0013 AND SO HUMAN LIFE HAS COME TO BE CONSIDERED BUT LIGHTLY ON MARS AS IS EVIDENCED BY THEIR DANGEROUS SPORTS AND THE ALMOST CONTINUAL WARFARE BETWEEN THE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES
446-123502-0014 WITHOUT A WEAPON OF DESTRUCTION AS WE NEARED THE PLAZA AND MY PRESENCE WAS DISCOVERED WE WERE IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDED BY HUNDREDS OF THE CREATURES WHO SEEMED ANXIOUS TO PLUCK ME FROM MY SEAT BEHIND MY GUARD A WORD FROM THE LEADER OF THE PARTY
446-123502-0015 STILLED THEIR CLAMOR AND WE PROCEEDED AT A TROT ACROSS THE PLAZA TO THE ENTRANCE OF AS MAGNIFICENT AN EDIFICE AS MORTAL EYE HAS RESTED UPON THE BUILDING WAS LOW BUT COVERED AN ENORMOUS AREA
446-123502-0016 IT WAS CONSTRUCTED OF GLEAMING WHITE MARBLE INLAID WITH GOLD AND BRILLIANT STONES WHICH SPARKLED AND SCINTILLATED IN THE SUNLIGHT THE MAIN ENTRANCE WAS SOME HUNDRED FEET IN WIDTH AND PROJECTED FROM THE BUILDING PROPER
446-123502-0017 TO FORM A HUGE CANOPY ABOVE THE ENTRANCE HALL THERE WAS NO STAIRWAY BUT A GENTLE INCLINE TO THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE BUILDING OPENED INTO AN ENORMOUS CHAMBER ENCIRCLED BY GALLERIES ON THE FLOOR OF THIS CHAMBER
446-123502-0018 WHICH WAS DOTTED WITH HIGHLY CARVED WOODEN DESKS AND CHAIRS WERE ASSEMBLED ABOUT FORTY OR FIFTY MALE MARTIANS AROUND THE STEPS OF A ROSTRUM ON THE PLATFORM PROPER
446-123502-0019 GAY COLORED FEATHERS AND BEAUTIFULLY WROUGHT LEATHER TRAPPINGS INGENIOUSLY SET WITH PRECIOUS STONES FROM HIS SHOULDERS DEPENDED A SHORT CAPE OF WHITE FUR LINED WITH BRILLIANT SCARLET SILK WHAT STRUCK ME AS MOST REMARKABLE
446-123502-0020 ABOUT THIS ASSEMBLAGE AND THE HALL IN WHICH THEY WERE CONGREGATED WAS THE FACT THAT THE CREATURES WERE ENTIRELY OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE DESKS CHAIRS AND OTHER FURNISHINGS THESE BEING OF A SIZE ADAPTED TO HUMAN BEINGS SUCH AS I
446-123502-0021 WHEREAS THE GREAT BULKS OF THE MARTIANS
446-123502-0022 NOR WAS THERE ROOM BENEATH THE DESKS FOR THEIR LONG LEGS EVIDENTLY THEN THERE WERE OTHER DENIZENS ON MARS THAN THE WILD AND GROTESQUE CREATURES INTO WHOSE HANDS I HAD FALLEN BUT THE EVIDENCES OF EXTREME ANTIQUITY
446-123502-0023 AND AT A SIGN FROM THE LEADER I HAD BEEN LOWERED TO THE GROUND AGAIN LOCKING HIS ARM IN MINE WE HAD PROCEEDED INTO THE AUDIENCE CHAMBER THERE WERE FEW FORMALITIES OBSERVED IN APPROACHING THE MARTIAN CHIEFTAIN
446-123502-0024 MY CAPTOR MERELY STRODE UP TO THE ROSTRUM THE OTHERS MAKING WAY FOR HIM AS HE ADVANCED THE CHIEFTAIN ROSE TO HIS FEET AND UTTERED THE NAME OF MY ESCORT WHO IN TURN HALTED AND REPEATED THE NAME OF THE RULER FOLLOWED BY HIS TITLE
446-123502-0025 AT THE TIME THIS CEREMONY AND THE WORDS THEY UTTERED MEANT NOTHING TO ME BUT LATER I CAME TO KNOW THAT THIS WAS THE CUSTOMARY GREETING BETWEEN GREEN MARTIANS HAD THE MEN BEEN STRANGERS AND THEREFORE UNABLE TO EXCHANGE NAMES
446-123502-0026 HAD THEIR MISSIONS BEEN PEACEFUL OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE EXCHANGED SHOTS OR HAVE FOUGHT OUT THEIR INTRODUCTION WITH SOME OTHER OF THEIR VARIOUS WEAPONS MY CAPTOR WHOSE NAME WAS TARS TARKAS
446-123502-0027 AND WHEN HE HAD CONCLUDED THE CHIEFTAIN ADDRESSED ME AT SOME LENGTH I REPLIED IN OUR GOOD OLD ENGLISH TONGUE MERELY TO CONVINCE HIM THAT NEITHER OF US COULD UNDERSTAND THE OTHER
446-123502-0028 BUT I NOTICED THAT WHEN I SMILED SLIGHTLY ON CONCLUDING HE DID LIKEWISE THIS FACT AND THE SIMILAR OCCURRENCE DURING MY FIRST TALK WITH TARS TARKAS CONVINCED ME THAT WE HAD AT LEAST SOMETHING IN COMMON THE ABILITY TO SMILE
446-123502-0029 THEREFORE TO LAUGH DENOTING A SENSE OF HUMOR BUT I WAS TO LEARN THAT THE MARTIAN SMILE IS MERELY PERFUNCTORY AND THAT THE MARTIAN LAUGH IS A THING TO CAUSE STRONG MEN TO BLANCH IN HORROR THE IDEAS
446-123502-0030 OF INCITANTS TO MERRIMENT THE DEATH AGONIES OF A FELLOW BEING ARE TO THESE STRANGE CREATURES PROVOCATIVE OF THE WILDEST HILARITY WHILE THEIR CHIEF FORM OF COMMONEST AMUSEMENT
446-123502-0031 IS TO INFLICT DEATH ON THEIR PRISONERS OF WAR IN VARIOUS INGENIOUS AND HORRIBLE WAYS THE ASSEMBLED WARRIORS AND CHIEFTAINS EXAMINED ME CLOSELY FEELING MY MUSCLES AND THE TEXTURE OF MY SKIN
446-123502-0032 THE PRINCIPAL CHIEFTAIN THEN EVIDENTLY SIGNIFIED A DESIRE TO SEE ME PERFORM AND MOTIONING ME TO FOLLOW HE STARTED WITH TARS TARKAS FOR THE OPEN PLAZA NOW I HAD MADE NO ATTEMPT TO WALK SINCE MY FIRST SIGNAL FAILURE
446-123502-0033 AND SO NOW I WENT SKIPPING AND FLITTING ABOUT AMONG THE DESKS AND CHAIRS LIKE SOME MONSTROUS GRASSHOPPER AFTER BRUISING MYSELF SEVERELY
446-123502-0034 AND I DID THE ONLY THING A GENTLEMAN MIGHT DO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF BRUTALITY BOORISHNESS AND LACK OF CONSIDERATION FOR A STRANGER'S RIGHTS I SWUNG MY FIST SQUARELY TO HIS JAW AND HE WENT DOWN LIKE A FELLED OX
446-123502-0035 AS HE SUNK TO THE FLOOR I WHEELED AROUND WITH MY BACK TOWARD THE NEAREST DESK EXPECTING TO BE OVERWHELMED BY THE VENGEANCE OF HIS FELLOWS BUT DETERMINED TO GIVE THEM AS GOOD A BATTLE AS THE UNEQUAL ODDS WOULD PERMIT BEFORE I GAVE UP MY LIFE
446-123502-0036 MY FEARS WERE GROUNDLESS HOWEVER AS THE OTHER MARTIANS AT FIRST STRUCK DUMB WITH WONDERMENT FINALLY BROKE INTO WILD PEALS OF LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE I DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE APPLAUSE AS SUCH BUT LATER
446-123502-0037 WHEN I HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR CUSTOMS I LEARNED THAT I HAD WON WHAT THEY SELDOM ACCORD A MANIFESTATION OF APPROBATION THE FELLOW WHOM I HAD STRUCK LAY WHERE HE HAD FALLEN
446-123502-0038 BUT I WAS NOT LONG IN BEING ENLIGHTENED THEY FIRST REPEATED THE WORD SAK A NUMBER OF TIMES AND THEN TARS TARKAS MADE SEVERAL JUMPS REPEATING THE SAME WORD BEFORE EACH LEAP THEN TURNING TO ME HE SAID SAK
446-123502-0039 I SAW WHAT THEY WERE AFTER AND GATHERING MYSELF TOGETHER I SAKKED WITH SUCH MARVELOUS SUCCESS THAT I CLEARED A GOOD HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET NOR DID I THIS TIME LOSE MY EQUILIBRIUM BUT LANDED SQUARELY UPON MY FEET
446-123502-0040 WITHOUT FALLING I THEN RETURNED BY EASY JUMPS OF TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY FEET TO THE LITTLE GROUP OF WARRIORS MY EXHIBITION HAD BEEN WITNESSED BY SEVERAL HUNDRED LESSER MARTIANS AND THEY IMMEDIATELY BROKE INTO DEMANDS FOR A REPETITION
446-123502-0041 WHICH THE CHIEFTAIN THEN ORDERED ME TO MAKE BUT I WAS BOTH HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AND DETERMINED ON THE SPOT THAT MY ONLY METHOD OF SALVATION WAS TO DEMAND THE CONSIDERATION FROM THESE CREATURES
446-123502-0042 WHICH THEY EVIDENTLY WOULD NOT VOLUNTARILY ACCORD I THEREFORE IGNORED THE REPEATED COMMANDS TO SAK AND EACH TIME THEY WERE MADE I MOTIONED TO MY MOUTH AND RUBBED MY STOMACH
446-123502-0043 TARS TARKAS AND THE CHIEF EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS AND THE FORMER CALLING TO A YOUNG FEMALE AMONG THE THRONG GAVE HER SOME INSTRUCTIONS AND MOTIONED ME TO ACCOMPANY HER
446-123502-0044 I GRASPED HER PROFFERED ARM AND TOGETHER WE CROSSED THE PLAZA TOWARD A LARGE BUILDING ON THE FAR SIDE MY FAIR COMPANION WAS ABOUT EIGHT FEET TALL HAVING JUST ARRIVED AT MATURITY BUT NOT YET TO HER FULL HEIGHT
446-123502-0045 SHE WAS OF A LIGHT OLIVE GREEN COLOR WITH A SMOOTH GLOSSY HIDE HER NAME AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED WAS SOLA AND SHE BELONGED TO THE RETINUE OF TARS TARKAS SHE CONDUCTED ME TO A SPACIOUS CHAMBER
446-123502-0046 IN ONE OF THE BUILDINGS FRONTING ON THE PLAZA AND WHICH FROM THE LITTER OF SILKS AND FURS UPON THE FLOOR I TOOK TO BE THE SLEEPING QUARTERS OF SEVERAL OF THE NATIVES THE ROOM WAS WELL LIGHTED BY A NUMBER OF LARGE WINDOWS
446-123502-0047 AND WAS BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED WITH MURAL PAINTINGS AND MOSAICS
446-123502-0048 MADE A PECULIAR HISSING SOUND AS THOUGH SIGNALING TO SOMEONE IN AN ADJOINING ROOM IN RESPONSE TO HER CALL I OBTAINED MY FIRST SIGHT OF A NEW MARTIAN WONDER IT WADDLED IN ON ITS TEN SHORT LEGS AND SQUATTED DOWN BEFORE THE GIRL
446-123502-0049 LIKE AN OBEDIENT PUPPY THE THING WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SHETLAND PONY
4481-17498-0000 THE AUTHOR IS PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT A SEQUEL TO AUNT JANE'S NIECES THE BOOK WHICH WAS RECEIVED WITH SO MUCH FAVOR LAST YEAR YET IT IS NOT NECESSARY ONE SHOULD HAVE READ THE FIRST BOOK TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE PRESENT VOLUME
4481-17498-0001 THE CHARACTERS BEING TAKEN TO ENTIRELY NEW SCENES THE VARIOUS FOREIGN LOCALITIES ARE ACCURATELY DESCRIBED
4481-17498-0002 WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN SO FORTUNATE MAY ACQUIRE A CLEAR CONCEPTION OF THEM
4481-17498-0003 LEST I BE ACCUSED OF UNDUE SENSATIONALISM IN RELATING THE SOMEWHAT DRAMATIC SICILIAN INCIDENT I WILL ASSURE MY READER THAT THE STORY DOES NOT EXAGGERATE PRESENT CONDITIONS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE ISLAND IN FACT IL DUCA AND TATO
4481-17498-0004 ARE DRAWN FROM LIFE ALTHOUGH THEY DID NOT HAVE THEIR MOUNTAIN LAIR SO NEAR TO TAORMINA AS I HAVE VENTURED TO LOCATE IT EXCEPT THAT I HAVE ADAPTED THEIR CLEVER SYSTEM OF BRIGANDAGE TO THE EXIGENCIES OF THIS STORY THEIR HISTORY IS TRULY RELATED
4481-17498-0005 MANY WHO HAVE TRAVELLED SOMEWHAT OUTSIDE THE BEATEN TRACKS IN SICILY WILL FRANKLY VOUCH FOR THIS STATEMENT ITALY IS DOING ITS BEST TO SUPPRESS THE MAFIA AND TO ELIMINATE BRIGANDAGE FROM THE BEAUTIFUL ISLANDS IT CONTROLS BUT SO FEW OF THE INHABITANTS ARE ITALIANS
4481-17498-0006 OR IN SYMPATHY WITH THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE WORK OF REFORMATION IS NECESSARILY SLOW AMERICANS ESPECIALLY MUST EXERCISE CAUTION IN TRAVELLING IN ANY PART OF SICILY YET WITH PROPER CARE NOT TO TEMPT THE IRRESPONSIBLE NATIVES
4481-17498-0007 THEY ARE AS SAFE IN SICILY AS THEY ARE AT HOME AUNT JANE'S NIECES ARE SHOWN TO BE AS FRANKLY ADVENTUROUS AS THE AVERAGE CLEAR HEADED AMERICAN GIRL BUT THEIR EXPERIENCES AMID THE ENVIRONMENTS OF AN ANCIENT AND STILL PRIMITIVE CIVILIZATION ARE IN NO WISE EXTRAORDINARY
4481-17498-0008 THE DOYLES ARE ASTONISHED IT WAS SUNDAY AFTERNOON IN MISS PATRICIA DOYLE'S PRETTY FLAT AT THIRTY SEVEN O EIGHT WILLING SQUARE IN THE SMALL DRAWING ROOM PATRICIA OR PATSY AS SHE PREFERRED TO BE CALLED
4481-17498-0009 WAS SEATED AT THE PIANO SOFTLY PLAYING THE ONE PIECE THE MUSIC TEACHER HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRILLING INTO HER FLIGHTY HEAD BY VIRTUE OF MUCH PATIENCE AND PERSEVERANCE IN A THICK CUSHIONED MORRIS CHAIR RECLINED THE MOTIONLESS FORM OF UNCLE JOHN
4481-17498-0010 A CHUBBY LITTLE MAN IN A GRAY SUIT WHOSE FEATURES WERE TEMPORARILY ECLIPSED BY THE NEWSPAPER THAT WAS SPREAD CAREFULLY OVER THEM OCCASIONALLY A GASP OR A SNORE FROM BENEATH THE PAPER SUGGESTED THAT THE LITTLE MAN WAS SNOOZING
4481-17498-0011 AS HE SOMETIMES GRAVELY CALLED IT INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO THE MUSIC MAJOR DOYLE SAT OPPOSITE STIFFLY ERECT WITH HIS ADMIRING EYES FULL UPON PATSY AT TIMES HE DRUMMED UPON THE ARMS OF HIS CHAIR IN UNISON WITH THE MUSIC
4481-17498-0012 NODDING HIS GRIZZLED HEAD TO MARK THE TIME AS WELL AS TO EMPHASIZE HIS EVIDENT APPROBATION PATSY HAD PLAYED THIS SAME PIECE FROM START TO FINISH SEVEN TIMES SINCE DINNER BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY ONE SHE KNEW
4481-17498-0013 BUT THE MAJOR COULD HAVE LISTENED TO IT SEVEN HUNDRED TIMES WITHOUT THE FLICKER OF AN EYELASH IT WAS NOT THAT HE ADMIRED SO MUCH THE PIECE THE GIRL WAS PLAYING AS THE GIRL WHO WAS PLAYING THE PIECE HIS PRIDE IN PATSY WAS UNBOUNDED
4481-17498-0014 THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED AT ALL IN MASTERING THAT IMPOSING LOOKING INSTRUMENT MAKING IT ACTUALLY PLAY CHUNES WAS SURELY A THING TO WONDER AT BUT THEN PATSY COULD DO ANYTHING IF SHE BUT TRIED SUDDENLY UNCLE JOHN GAVE A DREADFUL SNORT
4481-17498-0015 AND SAT BOLT UPRIGHT GAZING AT HIS COMPANIONS WITH A STARTLED LOOK THAT MELTED INTO ONE OF BENIGN COMPLACENCY AS HE OBSERVED HIS SURROUNDINGS AND REALIZED WHERE HE WAS THE INTERRUPTION GAVE PATSY AN OPPORTUNITY TO STOP PLAYING THE TUNE
4481-17498-0016 SHE SWUNG AROUND ON THE STOOL AND LOOKED WITH AMUSEMENT AT HER NEWLY AWAKENED UNCLE YOU'VE BEEN ASLEEP SHE SAID NO INDEED QUITE A MISTAKE REPLIED THE LITTLE MAN SERIOUSLY I'VE ONLY BEEN THINKING
4481-17498-0017 AN SUCH BEAUT CHIFUL THOUGHTS OBSERVED THE MAJOR TESTILY FOR HE RESENTED THE INTERRUPTION OF HIS SUNDAY AFTERNOON TREAT YOU THOUGHT EM ALOUD SIR AND THE SOUND OF IT WAS A BAD IMITHATION OF A BULLFROG IN A MARSH
4481-17498-0018 YOU'LL HAVE TO GIVE UP EATING THE SALAD SIR BAH DON'T I KNOW ASKED UNCLE JOHN INDIGNANTLY WELL IF YOUR KNOWLEDGE IS BETTER THAN OUR HEARING I SUPPOSE YOU DO RETORTED THE MAJOR BUT TO AN IGNORANT INDIVIDUAL LIKE MESELF
4481-17498-0019 THE IMPRESSION CONVEYED WAS THAT YOU SNORED LIKE A MAN THAT HAS FORGOTTEN HIS MANNERS AN GONE TO SLEEP IN THE PRISENCE OF A LADY THEN NO ONE HAS A BETTER RIGHT TO DO THAT DECLARED PATSY SOOTHINGLY AND I'M SURE OUR DEAR UNCLE JOHN'S THOUGHTS
4481-17498-0020 WERE JUST THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DREAMS IN THE WORLD TELL US OF THEM SIR AND WE'LL PROVE THE MAJOR UTTERLY WRONG EVEN HER FATHER SMILED AT THE GIRL'S DIPLOMACY AND UNCLE JOHN WHO WAS ON THE VERGE OF UNREASONABLE ANGER BEAMED UPON HER GRATEFULLY
4481-17498-0021 I'M GOING TO EUROPE HE SAID THE MAJOR GAVE AN INVOLUNTARY START AND THEN TURNED TO LOOK AT HIM CURIOUSLY AND I'M GOING TO TAKE PATSY ALONG HE CONTINUED WITH A MISCHIEVOUS GRIN THE MAJOR FROWNED
4481-17498-0022 YOU'RE DREAMING AGAIN PATSY SWUNG HER FEET FROM SIDE TO SIDE FOR SHE WAS SUCH A LITTLE THING THAT THE STOOL RAISED HER ENTIRELY OFF THE FLOOR THERE WAS A THOUGHTFUL LOOK ON HER ROUND FRECKLED FACE AND A WISTFUL ONE IN HER GREAT BLUE EYES
4481-17498-0023 AS THE FULL MEANING OF UNCLE JOHN'S ABRUPT AVOWAL BECAME APPARENT THE MAJOR WAS STILL FROWNING BUT A HALF FRIGHTENED EXPRESSION HAD REPLACED THE ONE OF SCORNFUL RAILLERY FOR HE TOO KNEW THAT HIS ECCENTRIC BROTHER IN LAW WAS LIKELY TO PROPOSE ANY PREPOSTEROUS THING
4481-17498-0024 AND THEN CARRY IT OUT IN SPITE OF ALL OPPOSITION BUT TO TAKE PATSY TO EUROPE WOULD BE LIKE PULLING THE MAJOR'S EYE TEETH OR AMPUTATING HIS GOOD RIGHT ARM WORSE FAR WORSE IT WOULD MEAN TAKING THE SUNSHINE OUT OF HER OLD FATHER'S SKY ALTOGETHER
4481-17498-0025 AND PAINTING IT A GRIM DESPAIRING GRAY BUT HE RESOLVED NOT TO SUBMIT WITHOUT A STRUGGLE SIR SAID HE STERNLY HE ALWAYS CALLED HIS BROTHER IN LAW SIR WHEN HE WAS IN A SARCASTIC OR REPROACHFUL MOOD I'VE HAD AN IDEA FOR SOME TIME THAT YOU WERE PLOTTING MISCHIEF
4481-17498-0026 I WILL ASK YOU TO EXPLAIN TO US SIR THE BRUTAL SUGGESTION YOU HAVE JUST ADVANCED UNCLE JOHN LAUGHED IN THE DAYS WHEN MAJOR DOYLE HAD THOUGHT HIM A POOR MAN AND IN NEED OF A HELPING HAND
4481-17498-0027 THE GRIZZLED OLD IRISHMAN HAD BEEN AS TENDER TOWARD HIM AS A WOMAN AND STUDIOUSLY AVOIDED ANY SPEECH OR EPITHET THAT BY CHANCE MIGHT INJURE THE FEELINGS OF HIS DEAD WIFE'S ONLY BROTHER BUT THE MAJOR'S INVARIABLE COURTESY TO THE POOR OR UNFORTUNATE
4481-17498-0028 WAS NO LONGER IN EVIDENCE WHEN HE FOUND THAT JOHN MERRICK WAS A MULTI MILLIONAIRE WITH A STRONGLY DEFINED HABIT OF DOING GOOD TO OTHERS AND STRIVING IN OBSCURE AND UNCONVENTIONAL WAYS TO MAKE EVERYBODY AROUND HIM HAPPY
4481-17498-0029 HIS AFFECTION FOR THE LITTLE MAN INCREASED MIGHTILY BUT HIS RESPECTFUL ATTITUDE PROMPTLY CHANGED AND A CHANCE TO REPROVE OR DISCOMFIT HIS ABSURDLY RICH BROTHER IN LAW WAS ONE OF HIS MOST SATISFACTORY DIVERSIONS UNCLE JOHN APPRECIATED THIS
4481-17498-0030 AND HOLDING THE DIGNIFIED MAJOR IN LOVING REGARD WAS GLAD TO CROSS SWORDS WITH HIM NOW AND THEN TO ADD VARIETY TO THEIR PLEASANT RELATIONS IT'S THIS WAY MAJOR DOYLE HE NOW REMARKED COOLLY
4481-17498-0031 YOU'VE NO WORRY AT ALL WHY WE'VE JUST MADE YOU A QUARTER OF A MILLION IN C H AND D'S THE WE IS EXPLAINED BY STATING THAT THE MAJOR HELD AN IMPORTANT POSITION IN THE GREAT BANKING HOUSE A POSITION MISTER MERRICK HAD SECURED FOR HIM SOME MONTHS PREVIOUSLY
4481-17498-0032 THAT'S IT SAID UNCLE JOHN YOU'VE MADE ME A QUARTER OF A MILLION THAT I DON'T WANT THE C H AND D STOCKS WERE GOING TO PIECES WHEN I BOUGHT THEM AND I HAD REASON TO HOPE I'D LOSE A GOOD ROUND SUM ON THEM BUT THE CONFOUNDED LUCK TURNED
4481-17498-0033 AND THE RESULT IS AN ACCUMULATION OF ALL THIS DREADFUL MONEY SO MY DEAR MAJOR
4481-17498-0034 AND WHERE BY INDUSTRY AND PERSEVERANCE I CAN SCATTER SOME OF MY ILL GOTTEN GAINS THE MAJOR SMILED GRIMLY THAT'S EUROPE RIGHT ENOUGH HE SAID AND I DON'T OBJECT JOHN TO YOUR GOING THERE WHENEVER YOU PLEASE YOU'RE DISGRACEFULLY COUNTRYFIED
4481-17498-0035 AND EUROPE'LL OPEN YOUR EYES AND PROVE TO YOU HOW INSIGNIFICANT YOU REALLY ARE I ADVISE YOU TO VISIT IRELAND SOR WHICH I'M RELIABLY INFORMED IS THE CENTHRAL JEWEL IN EUROPE'S CROWN OF BEAUTY GO
4481-17498-0036 AND GO WHINEVER YOU PLEASE SOR BUT FORBEAR THE WICKEDNESS OF PUTTING FOOLISH THOUGHTS INTO OUR PATSY'S SWEET HEAD SHE CAN'T GO A STEP AND YOU KNOW IT IT'S POSITIVE CRUELTY TO HER SIR TO SUGGEST SUCH A THING
4481-17498-0037 THE MAJOR'S SPEECH HAD A TOUCH OF THE BROGUE WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED BUT RECOVERED WHEN HE CALMED DOWN WHY YOU SELFISH OLD HUMBUG CRIED UNCLE JOHN INDIGNANTLY WHY CAN'T SHE GO WHEN THERE'S MONEY AND TIME TO SPARE
4481-17498-0038 WOULD YOU KEEP HER HERE TO CUDDLE AND SPOIL A VIGOROUS MAN LIKE YOURSELF WHEN SHE CAN RUN AWAY AND SEE THE WORLD AND BE HAPPY IT'S A GREAT HAPPINESS TO CUDDLE THE MAJOR SAID PATSY SOFTLY AND THE POOR MAN NEEDS IT AS MUCH AS HE DOES HIS SLIPPERS
4481-17498-0039 OR HIS OATMEAL FOR BREAKFAST AND PATSY HAS THE HOUSE TO LOOK AFTER ADDED THE MAJOR COMPLACENTLY UNCLE JOHN GAVE A SNORT OF CONTEMPT FOR AN UNREASONABLE MAN SHOW ME AN IRISHMAN HE REMARKED
4481-17498-0040 HERE YOU'VE BEEN TELLING ME HOW EUROPE IS AN EDUCATION AND A DELIGHT AND IN THE NEXT BREATH YOU DELIBERATELY DEPRIVE YOUR LITTLE DAUGHTER WHOM YOU PRETEND TO LOVE OF THE ADVANTAGES SHE MIGHT GAIN BY A TRIP ABROAD AND WHY JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT HER YOURSELF
4481-17498-0041 AND MIGHT BE A BIT LONESOME WITHOUT HER BUT I'LL SETTLE THAT FOOLISHNESS SIR IN SHORT ORDER YOU SHALL GO WITH US IMPOSSIBLE EJACULATED THE MAJOR IT'S THE TIME OF YEAR I'M MOST NEEDED IN THE OFFICE
4481-17498-0042 AND MISTER MARVIN HAS BEEN SO KIND AND CONSIDERATE THAT I WON'T PLAY HIM A DIRTY TRICK BY LEAVING HIM IN THE LURCH PATSY NODDED APPROVAL THAT'S RIGHT DADDY SHE SAID UNCLE JOHN LAY BACK IN THE CHAIR AND PUT THE NEWSPAPER OVER HIS FACE AGAIN
4481-17498-0043 THEN THE MAJOR DREW OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND MOPPED HIS BROW YOU'D LIKE TO GO MAVOURNEEN HE ASKED SOFTLY YES DADDY BUT I WON'T OF COURSE TUT TUT DON'T YOU GO PUTTING YOURSELF AGAINST YOUR OLD FATHER'S WILL PATSY IT'S NOT SO FAR TO EUROPE HE CONTINUED THOUGHTFULLY

4481-17498-0048 AND HE LOOKED AFFECTIONATELY AT THE ROUND LITTLE MAN UNDER THE NEWSPAPER UNCLE JOHN EMERGED AGAIN IT WAS WONDERFUL HOW WELL HE UNDERSTOOD THE DOYLE FAMILY HIS FACE WAS NOW SMILING AND WORE A LOOK OF SUPREME SATISFACTION
4481-17499-0000 UNCLE JOHN MAKES PLANS THE THOUGHT CAME TO ME A LONG TIME AGO UNCLE JOHN RESUMED BUT IT WAS ONLY YESTERDAY THAT I GOT ALL THE DETAILS FIXED AND SETTLED IN MY MIND I'VE BEEN A ROUGH OLD DUFFER PATSY
4481-17499-0001 AND IN ALL MY HARD WORKING LIFE NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING AS TRAVELLING OR ENJOYING MYSELF UNTIL I FELL IN WITH YOU AND YOU TAUGHT ME HOW PLEASANT IT IS TO SCATTER SUNSHINE IN THE HEARTS OF OTHERS FOR TO MAKE OTHERS HAPPY MEANS A LOT OF JOY FOR YOURSELF

4481-17499-0010 JOHN MERRICK WAS SIXTY YEARS OLD BUT AS HALE AND RUGGED AS A BOY OF TWENTY HE HAD MADE HIS VAST FORTUNE ON THE PACIFIC COAST
4481-17499-0011 WHO NEVER HAD CREDITED HIM WITH SUFFICIENT ABILITY TO EARN MORE THAN A PRECARIOUS LIVELIHOOD BUT THE MAN WAS SHREWD ENOUGH IN A BUSINESS WAY ALTHOUGH SIMPLE ALMOST TO CHILDISHNESS IN MANY OTHER MATTERS WHEN HE RETURNED QUITE UNHERALDED TO END HIS DAYS AT HOME
4481-17499-0012 AND EMPLOY HIS AMPLE WEALTH TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE HE FOR A TIME KEPT HIS SUCCESS A SECRET AND SO LEARNED MUCH OF THE DISPOSITIONS AND PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF HIS THREE NIECES THEY WERE AT THAT TIME VISITING HIS UNMARRIED SISTER JANE AT HER ESTATE AT ELMHURST

4481-17499-0015 BY KEEPING BOOKS FOR A MERCANTILE FIRM WHILE PATSY WORKED IN A HAIR DRESSER'S SHOP IT WAS NOW THAT UNCLE JOHN PROVED A MODERN FAIRY GODFATHER TO AUNT JANE'S NIECES WHO WERE LIKEWISE HIS OWN NIECES THE THREE GIRLS HAD LITTLE IN COMMON EXCEPT THEIR POVERTY
4481-17499-0016 ELIZABETH DE GRAF BEING THE DAUGHTER OF A MUSIC TEACHER IN CLOVERTON OHIO WHILE LOUISE MERRICK LIVED WITH HER WIDOWED MOTHER IN A SOCIAL ATMOSPHERE OF THE SECOND CLASS IN NEW YORK
4481-17499-0017 WHERE THE TWO WOMEN FRANKLY INTRIGUED TO ENSNARE FOR LOUISE A HUSBAND WHO HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS TO ENSURE BOTH MOTHER AND DAUGHTER A COMFORTABLE HOME IN SPITE OF THIS WORLDLY AND UNLOVELY AMBITION WHICH THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT PARTIALLY EXCUSE LOUISE
4481-17499-0018 WHO WAS BUT SEVENTEEN HAD MANY GOOD AND WOMANLY QUALITIES COULD THEY HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN AN ATMOSPHERE UNINFLUENCED BY THE SCHEMES OF HER VAIN AND SELFISH MOTHER UNCLE JOHN CASTING ASIDE THE MASK OF POVERTY CAME TO THE RELIEF OF ALL THREE GIRLS
4481-17499-0019 HE SETTLED THE INCOMES OF SUBSTANTIAL SUMS OF MONEY UPON BOTH BETH AND LOUISE MAKING THEM PRACTICALLY INDEPENDENT FOR PATSY HE BOUGHT A HANDSOME MODERN FLAT BUILDING LOCATED AT THIRTY SEVEN O EIGHT WILLING SQUARE
4481-17499-0020 AND INSTALLED HER AND THE MAJOR IN ITS COSIEST APARTMENT THE RENTS OF THE REMAINING FLATS GIVING THE DOYLES AN ADEQUATE INCOME FOR ALL TIME TO COME HERE UNCLE JOHN BELIEVING HIMSELF CORDIALLY WELCOME AS INDEED HE WAS MADE HIS OWN HOME
4481-17499-0021 AND IT REQUIRED NO SHREWD GUESSING TO ARRIVE AT THE CONCLUSION THAT LITTLE PATSY WAS DESTINED TO INHERIT SOME DAY ALL HIS MILLIONS
4481-17499-0022 HAD LONG MANAGED SUCCESSFULLY JOHN MERRICK'S VAST FORTUNE AND AT HIS SOLICITATION IT GAVE MAJOR DOYLE A RESPONSIBLE POSITION IN ITS MAIN OFFICE WITH A SALARY THAT RENDERED HIM INDEPENDENT OF HIS DAUGHTER'S SUDDENLY ACQUIRED WEALTH AND MADE HIM PROUD AND SELF RESPECTING
4481-17499-0023 MONEY HAD NO POWER TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE DOYLES THE MAJOR REMAINED THE SAME SIMPLE HONEST COURTEOUS YET BRUSQUE OLD WARRIOR WHO HAD WON UNCLE JOHN'S LOVE AS A HARD WORKING BOOK KEEPER
4481-17499-0024 AND PATSY'S BRIGHT AND SUNNY DISPOSITION HAD CERTAIN POWER TO CHEER ANY HOME WHETHER LOCATED IN A PALACE OR A HOVEL NEVER BEFORE IN HIS LIFE HAD UNCLE JOHN BEEN SO SUPREMELY HAPPY
4481-17499-0025 AND NEVER BEFORE HAD AUNT JANE'S THREE NIECES HAD SO MANY ADVANTAGES AND PLEASURES IT WAS TO CONFER STILL FURTHER BENEFITS UPON THESE GIRLS THAT THEIR ECCENTRIC UNCLE HAD PLANNED THIS UNEXPECTED EUROPEAN TRIP HIS TELEGRAM TO ELIZABETH WAS CHARACTERISTIC
4481-17499-0026 PATSY LOUISE AND I SAIL FOR EUROPE NEXT TUESDAY WILL YOU JOIN US AS MY GUEST IF SO TAKE FIRST TRAIN TO NEW YORK WHERE I WILL LOOK AFTER YOUR OUTFIT ANSWER IMMEDIATELY THAT WAS A MESSAGE LIKELY TO SURPRISE A COUNTRY GIRL
4481-17499-0027 BUT IT DID NOT STRIKE JOHN MERRICK AS IN ANY WAY EXTRAORDINARY HE THOUGHT HE COULD DEPEND UPON BETH SHE WOULD BE AS EAGER TO GO AS HE WAS TO HAVE HER AND WHEN HE HAD PAID FOR THE TELEGRAM HE DISMISSED THE MATTER FROM FURTHER THOUGHT NEXT MORNING
4481-17499-0028 PATSY REMINDED HIM THAT INSTEAD OF GOING DOWN TOWN HE MUST PERSONALLY NOTIFY LOUISE MERRICK OF THE PROPOSED TRIP SO HE TOOK A CROSS TOWN LINE AND ARRIVED AT THE MERRICK'S HOME AT NINE O'CLOCK MISSUS MERRICK WAS IN A MORNING WRAPPER
4481-17499-0029 SIPPING HER COFFEE IN AN UPPER ROOM BUT SHE COULD NOT DENY HERSELF TO UNCLE JOHN HER DEAD HUSBAND'S BROTHER AND HER ONLY DAUGHTER'S BENEFACTOR WHICH MEANT INDIRECTLY HER OWN BENEFACTOR SO SHE ORDERED THE MAID TO SHOW HIM UP AT ONCE
4481-17499-0030 LOUISE IS STILL SWEETLY SLEEPING SHE SAID AND WON'T WAKEN FOR HOURS YET IS ANYTHING WRONG WITH HER HE ASKED ANXIOUSLY OH DEAR NO BUT EVERYONE DOES NOT GET UP WITH THE MILKMAN AS YOU DO JOHN
4481-17499-0031 AND THE DEAR CHILD WAS AT THE OPERA LAST NIGHT WHICH MADE HER LATE IN GETTING HOME DOESN'T THE OPERA LET OUT BEFORE MIDNIGHT THE SAME AS THE THEATRES HE ASKED I BELIEVE SO BUT THERE IS THE SUPPER AFTERWARD YOU KNOW
4481-17499-0032 AH YES HE RETURNED THOUGHTFULLY I'VE ALWAYS NOTICED THAT THE OPERA MAKES FOLKS DESPERATELY HUNGRY FOR THEY FLOCK TO THE RESTAURANTS AS SOON AS THEY CAN GET AWAY SINGULAR ISN'T IT WHY I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT IN THAT LIGHT
4481-17499-0033 BUT LOUISE IS WELL QUITE WELL THANK YOU THAT'S A GREAT RELIEF FOR I'M GOING TO TAKE HER TO EUROPE WITH ME NEXT WEEK HE SAID MISSUS MERRICK WAS SO ASTONISHED THAT SHE NEARLY DROPPED HER COFFEE CUP
4481-17499-0034 AND COULD MAKE NO BETTER REPLY THAN TO STARE BLANKLY AT HER BROTHER IN LAW WE SAIL TUESDAY CONTINUED UNCLE JOHN AND YOU MUST HAVE MY NIECE READY IN TIME AND DELIVER HER ON BOARD THE PRINCESS IRENE AT HOBOKEN AT NINE O'CLOCK SHARP
4481-17499-0035 IT WILL TAKE A MONTH AT LEAST TO MAKE HER GOWNS AND STUFF AND RUBBISH HE GROWLED THAT SHOWS MARTHA HOW LITTLE YOU KNOW ABOUT EUROPEAN TRIPS NO ONE MAKES GOWNS TO GO ABROAD WITH YOU BUY EM IN PARIS TO BRING HOME
4481-17499-0036 AH YES TO BE SURE SHE MUTTERED PERHAPS THEN IT CAN BE DONE IF LOUISE HAS NO OTHER ENGAGEMENTS JUST WHAT PATSY SAID SEE HERE MARTHA DO YOU IMAGINE THAT ANY GIRL WHO IS HALF HUMAN COULD HAVE ENGAGEMENTS THAT WOULD KEEP HER FROM EUROPE
4481-17499-0037 BUT THE REQUIREMENTS OF SOCIETY YOU'LL GET ME RILED PRETTY SOON MARTHA AND IF YOU DO YOU'LL WISH YOU HADN'T THIS SPEECH FRIGHTENED THE WOMAN IT WOULDN'T DO TO PROVOKE UNCLE JOHN HOWEVER UNREASONABLE HE HAPPENED TO BE SO SHE SAID MEEKLY
4481-17499-0038 I'VE NO DOUBT LOUISE WILL BE DELIGHTED TO GO AND SO WILL I YOU WHY WHY WHOM DO YOU INTEND TAKING JUST THE THREE GIRLS AUNT JANE'S THREE NIECES ALSO MINE BUT YOU'LL WANT A CHAPERONE FOR THEM
4481-17499-0039 WHY SO PROPRIETY REQUIRES IT AND SO DOES ORDINARY PRUDENCE LOUISE I KNOW WILL BE DISCREET FOR IT IS HER NATURE BUT PATSY IS SUCH A LITTLE FLYAWAY
4481-17499-0040 UNCLE JOHN GREW RED AND HIS EYES FLASHED A CHAPERONE HE CRIED CONTEMPTUOUSLY NOT ANY IN MINE MARTHA MERRICK EITHER WE YOUNG FOLKS GO ALONE WITHOUT ANY DEATH'S HEAD TO PERPETUALLY GLOWER AT US
4481-17499-0041 THREE BETTER GIRLS NEVER LIVED AND I'LL TRUST EM ANYWHERE BESIDES THAT WE AREN'T GOING TO ANY OF YOUR CONFOUNDED SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WE'RE GOING ON A REG'LAR PICNIC AND IF I DON'T GIVE THOSE GIRLS THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES MY NAME AIN'T JOHN MERRICK
4481-17499-0042 A CHAPERONE INDEED MISSUS MERRICK HELD UP HER HANDS IN HORROR I'M NOT SURE JOHN SHE GASPED THAT I OUGHT TO TRUST MY DEAR CHILD WITH AN UNCLE WHO DISREGARDS SO OPENLY THE PROPRIETIES
4481-17499-0043 WELL I'M SURE AND THE THING'S SETTLED HE SAID MORE CALMLY DON'T WORRY MA'AM I'LL LOOK AFTER PATSY AND BETH AND LOUISE WILL LOOK AFTER ALL OF US JUST AS SHE DOES AFTER YOU BECAUSE SHE'S SO DISCREET TALK ABOUT YOUR BEING A CHAPERONE
4481-17499-0044 WHY YOU DON'T DARE SAY YOUR SOUL'S YOUR OWN WHEN LOUISE IS AWAKE THAT CHAPERONE BUSINESS IS ALL HUMBUGGERY UNLESS AN OLD UNCLE LIKE ME CAN BE A CHAPERONE ANYHOW I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT'S GOING TO BE APPOINTED I WON'T WAIT FOR LOUISE TO WAKE UP
4481-17499-0045 JUST TELL HER THE NEWS AND HELP HER TO GET READY ON TIME AND NOW I'M OFF GOOD MORNING MARTHA SHE REALLY HAD NO WORDS OF PROTEST READY AT HAND AND IT WAS LONG AFTER QUEER OLD JOHN MERRICK HAD GONE AWAY THAT SHE REMEMBERED A DOZEN EFFECTIVE SPEECHES THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE DELIVERED
4481-17499-0046 AFTER ALL SHE SIGHED TAKING UP HER CUP AGAIN IT MAY BE THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD FOR LOUISE WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT YOUNG WELDON WHO IS PAYING HER ATTENTIONS JUST NOW IS GOING TO INHERIT HIS FATHER'S MONEY OR NOT HE'S BEEN A BIT WILD I'VE HEARD
4481-17499-0047 AND IT IS JUST AS WELL TO POSTPONE ANY ENGAGEMENT UNTIL WE FIND OUT THE FACTS I CAN DO THAT NICELY WHILE MY SWEET CHILD IS IN EUROPE WITH UNCLE JOHN AND AWAY FROM ALL DANGER OF ENTANGLEMENTS
458-126290-0000 BUT WE MUST MAKE A PROVISION FOR WINTER OR ELSE WE SHALL SUFFER FROM HUNGER SAID THE CAT AND YOU LITTLE MOUSE CANNOT VENTURE EVERYWHERE OR YOU WILL BE CAUGHT IN A TRAP SOME DAY THE GOOD ADVICE WAS FOLLOWED AND A POT OF FAT WAS BOUGHT BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW WHERE TO PUT IT
458-126290-0001 AT LENGTH AFTER MUCH CONSIDERATION THE CAT SAID I KNOW NO PLACE WHERE IT WILL BE BETTER STORED UP THAN IN THE CHURCH FOR NO ONE DARES TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM THERE WE WILL SET IT BENEATH THE ALTAR AND NOT TOUCH IT UNTIL WE ARE REALLY IN NEED OF IT
458-126290-0002 SO THE POT WAS PLACED IN SAFETY
458-126290-0003 MY COUSIN HAS BROUGHT A LITTLE SON INTO THE WORLD AND HAS ASKED ME TO BE GODMOTHER HE IS WHITE WITH BROWN SPOTS AND I AM TO HOLD HIM OVER THE FONT AT THE CHRISTENING
458-126290-0004 AND YOU LOOK AFTER THE HOUSE BY YOURSELF YES YES ANSWERED THE MOUSE BY ALL MEANS GO AND IF YOU GET ANYTHING VERY GOOD TO EAT THINK OF ME I SHOULD LIKE A DROP OF SWEET RED CHRISTENING WINE MYSELF ALL THIS HOWEVER WAS UNTRUE
458-126290-0005 THE CAT HAD NO COUSIN AND HAD NOT BEEN ASKED TO BE GODMOTHER SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE CHURCH STOLE TO THE POT OF FAT BEGAN TO LICK AT IT AND LICKED THE TOP OF THE FAT OFF THEN SHE TOOK A WALK UPON THE ROOFS OF THE TOWN LOOKED OUT FOR OPPORTUNITIES
458-126290-0006 AND THEN STRETCHED HERSELF IN THE SUN AND LICKED HER LIPS WHENEVER SHE THOUGHT OF THE POT OF FAT AND NOT UNTIL IT WAS EVENING DID SHE RETURN HOME WELL HERE YOU ARE AGAIN SAID THE MOUSE NO DOUBT YOU HAVE HAD A MERRY DAY ALL WENT OFF WELL ANSWERED THE CAT

458-126290-0009 AS THE CHILD HAS A WHITE RING ROUND ITS NECK I CANNOT REFUSE THE GOOD MOUSE CONSENTED BUT THE CAT CREPT BEHIND THE TOWN WALLS TO THE CHURCH AND DEVOURED HALF THE POT OF FAT NOTHING EVER SEEMS SO GOOD AS WHAT ONE KEEPS TO ONESELF
458-126290-0010 WHEN SHE WENT HOME THE MOUSE INQUIRED AND WHAT WAS THE CHILD CHRISTENED HALF DONE ANSWERED THE CAT HALF DONE
458-126290-0011 I NEVER HEARD THE NAME IN MY LIFE I'LL WAGER ANYTHING IT IS NOT IN THE CALENDAR THE CAT'S MOUTH SOON BEGAN TO WATER FOR SOME MORE LICKING ALL GOOD THINGS GO IN THREES SAID SHE I AM ASKED TO STAND GODMOTHER AGAIN THE CHILD IS QUITE BLACK

458-126305-0041 THEN THE PEASANTS MADE UP THEIR MINDS THAT THEY TOO WOULD FETCH SOME SHEEP FOR THEMSELVES A FLOCK APIECE BUT THE MAYOR SAID I COME FIRST SO THEY WENT TO THE WATER TOGETHER
458-126305-0042 WHEREUPON THE PEASANTS CRIED WE ALREADY SEE THE SHEEP DOWN BELOW THE MAYOR PRESSED FORWARD AND SAID I WILL GO DOWN FIRST AND LOOK ABOUT ME AND IF THINGS PROMISE WELL I'LL CALL YOU
460-172357-0000 I KNOW NO WAY IN WHICH A WRITER MAY MORE FITTINGLY INTRODUCE HIS WORK TO THE PUBLIC THAN BY GIVING A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF WHO AND WHAT HE IS BY THIS MEANS SOME OF THE BLAME FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE IS VERY PROPERLY SHIFTED TO THE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS LIFE
460-172357-0001 MY PARENTS MIGRATED TO CANADA IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX AND I DECIDED TO GO WITH THEM MY FATHER TOOK UP A FARM NEAR LAKE SIMCOE IN ONTARIO THIS WAS DURING THE HARD TIMES OF CANADIAN FARMING
460-172357-0002 AND MY FATHER WAS JUST ABLE BY GREAT DILIGENCE TO PAY THE HIRED MEN AND IN YEARS OF PLENTY TO RAISE ENOUGH GRAIN TO HAVE SEED FOR THE NEXT YEAR'S CROP WITHOUT BUYING ANY BY THIS PROCESS MY BROTHERS AND I WERE INEVITABLY DRIVEN OFF THE LAND
460-172357-0003 THAT IS INDUCED BY HONEST MANUAL TOIL I WAS EDUCATED AT UPPER CANADA COLLEGE TORONTO OF WHICH I WAS HEAD BOY IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN FROM THERE I WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO WHERE I GRADUATED IN EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE
460-172357-0004 AT THE UNIVERSITY I SPENT MY ENTIRE TIME IN THE ACQUISITION OF LANGUAGES LIVING DEAD AND HALF DEAD AND KNEW NOTHING OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD IN THIS DILIGENT PURSUIT OF WORDS I SPENT ABOUT SIXTEEN HOURS OF EACH DAY
460-172357-0005 IN OTHER WORDS I WAS WHAT IS CALLED A DISTINGUISHED GRADUATE AND AS SUCH I TOOK TO SCHOOL TEACHING AS THE ONLY TRADE I COULD FIND THAT NEED NEITHER EXPERIENCE NOR INTELLECT I SPENT MY TIME FROM EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE TO EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE ON THE STAFF OF UPPER CANADA COLLEGE
460-172357-0006 AN EXPERIENCE WHICH HAS LEFT ME WITH A PROFOUND SYMPATHY FOR THE MANY GIFTED AND BRILLIANT MEN WHO ARE COMPELLED TO SPEND THEIR LIVES IN THE MOST DREARY THE MOST THANKLESS AND THE WORST PAID PROFESSION IN THE WORLD
460-172357-0007 AND BY MEANS OF THIS AND SOME TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT BY MC GILL UNIVERSITY I SURVIVED UNTIL I TOOK THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN NINETEEN O THREE THE MEANING OF THIS DEGREE IS THAT THE RECIPIENT OF INSTRUCTION IS EXAMINED FOR THE LAST TIME IN HIS LIFE AND IS PRONOUNCED COMPLETELY FULL
460-172357-0008 AFTER THIS NO NEW IDEAS CAN BE IMPARTED TO HIM FROM THIS TIME AND SINCE MY MARRIAGE WHICH HAD OCCURRED AT THIS PERIOD I HAVE BELONGED TO THE STAFF OF MC GILL UNIVERSITY FIRST AS LECTURER IN POLITICAL SCIENCE AND LATER AS HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
460-172357-0009 I AM ABLE TO REGARD MYSELF AS SINGULARLY FORTUNATE THE EMOLUMENT IS SO HIGH AS TO PLACE ME DISTINCTLY ABOVE THE POLICEMEN POSTMEN STREET CAR CONDUCTORS AND OTHER SALARIED OFFICIALS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
460-172357-0010 WHILE I AM ABLE TO MIX WITH THE POORER OF THE BUSINESS MEN OF THE CITY ON TERMS OF SOMETHING LIKE EQUALITY IN POINT OF LEISURE I ENJOY MORE IN THE FOUR CORNERS OF A SINGLE YEAR THAN A BUSINESS MAN KNOWS IN HIS WHOLE LIFE I THUS HAVE WHAT THE BUSINESS MAN CAN NEVER ENJOY
460-172357-0011 AN ABILITY TO THINK AND WHAT IS STILL BETTER TO STOP THINKING ALTOGETHER FOR MONTHS AT A TIME I HAVE WRITTEN A NUMBER OF THINGS IN CONNECTION WITH MY COLLEGE LIFE A BOOK ON POLITICAL SCIENCE AND MANY ESSAYS MAGAZINE ARTICLES AND SO ON
460-172357-0012 A FEW YEARS AGO I WENT ALL ROUND THE BRITISH EMPIRE DELIVERING ADDRESSES ON IMPERIAL ORGANIZATION WHEN I STATE THAT THESE LECTURES WERE FOLLOWED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BY THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA THE BANANA RIOTS IN TRINIDAD AND THE TURCO ITALIAN WAR
460-172357-0013 NOR TO CONSTRUCT EVEN THE SMALLEST SECTION OF THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY THIS HOWEVER IS A FORM OF NATIONAL INGRATITUDE TO WHICH ONE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED IN THIS DOMINION APART FROM MY COLLEGE WORK I HAVE WRITTEN TWO BOOKS ONE CALLED LITERARY LAPSES
460-172357-0014 AND THE OTHER NONSENSE NOVELS EACH OF THESE IS PUBLISHED BY JOHN LANE LONDON AND NEW YORK AND EITHER OF THEM CAN BE OBTAINED ABSURD THOUGH IT SOUNDS FOR THE MERE SUM OF THREE SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE ANY READER OF THIS PREFACE FOR EXAMPLE RIDICULOUS THOUGH IT APPEARS
460-172357-0015 COULD WALK INTO A BOOKSTORE AND BUY BOTH OF THESE BOOKS FOR SEVEN SHILLINGS YET THESE WORKS ARE OF SO HUMOROUS A CHARACTER THAT FOR MANY YEARS IT WAS FOUND IMPOSSIBLE TO PRINT THEM THE COMPOSITORS FELL BACK FROM THEIR TASK SUFFOCATED WITH LAUGHTER AND GASPING FOR AIR
460-172357-0016 MANY OF MY FRIENDS ARE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT I WRITE THESE HUMOROUS NOTHINGS IN IDLE MOMENTS WHEN THE WEARIED BRAIN IS UNABLE TO PERFORM THE SERIOUS LABOURS OF THE ECONOMIST MY OWN EXPERIENCE IS EXACTLY THE OTHER WAY
460-172357-0017 BUT TO WRITE SOMETHING OUT OF ONE'S OWN MIND WORTH READING FOR ITS OWN SAKE IS AN ARDUOUS CONTRIVANCE ONLY TO BE ACHIEVED IN FORTUNATE MOMENTS FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
460-172357-0018 IN REGARD TO THE PRESENT WORK I MUST DISCLAIM AT ONCE ALL INTENTIONS OF TRYING TO DO ANYTHING SO RIDICULOUSLY EASY AS WRITING ABOUT A REAL PLACE AND REAL PEOPLE MARIPOSA IS NOT A REAL TOWN ON THE CONTRARY IT IS ABOUT SEVENTY OR EIGHTY OF THEM
460-172357-0019 YOU MAY FIND THEM ALL THE WAY FROM LAKE SUPERIOR TO THE SEA WITH THE SAME SQUARE STREETS AND THE SAME MAPLE TREES AND THE SAME CHURCHES AND HOTELS AND EVERYWHERE THE SUNSHINE OF THE LAND OF HOPE SIMILARLY THE REVEREND MISTER DRONE IS NOT ONE PERSON BUT ABOUT EIGHT OR TEN
460-172357-0020 TO MAKE HIM I CLAPPED THE GAITERS OF ONE ECCLESIASTIC ROUND THE LEGS OF ANOTHER ADDED THE SERMONS OF A THIRD AND THE CHARACTER OF A FOURTH AND SO LET HIM START ON HIS WAY IN THE BOOK TO PICK UP SUCH INDIVIDUAL ATTRIBUTES AS HE MIGHT FIND FOR HIMSELF
460-172357-0021 MULLINS AND BAGSHAW AND JUDGE PEPPERLEIGH AND THE REST ARE IT IS TRUE PERSONAL FRIENDS OF MINE BUT I HAVE KNOWN THEM IN SUCH A VARIETY OF FORMS WITH SUCH ALTERNATIONS OF TALL AND SHORT DARK AND FAIR THAT INDIVIDUALLY I SHOULD HAVE MUCH ADO TO KNOW THEM
460-172357-0022 AND NEEDS A TELLER AS FOR MISTER SMITH WITH HIS TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY POUNDS HIS HOARSE VOICE HIS LOUD CHECK SUIT
460-172357-0023 ALL OF THIS IS KNOWN BY EVERYBODY TO BE A NECESSARY AND UNIVERSAL ADJUNCT OF THE HOTEL BUSINESS THE INSPIRATION OF THE BOOK
460-172357-0024 A LAND OF HOPE AND SUNSHINE WHERE LITTLE TOWNS SPREAD THEIR SQUARE STREETS AND THEIR TRIM MAPLE TREES BESIDE PLACID LAKES ALMOST WITHIN ECHO OF THE PRIMEVAL FOREST IS LARGE ENOUGH
460-172357-0025 THE FAULT LIES RATHER WITH AN ART THAT IS DEFICIENT THAN IN AN AFFECTION THAT IS WANTING
460-172359-0000 IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE MINING BOOM AT THE TIME WHEN EVERYBODY WENT SIMPLY CRAZY OVER THE COBALT AND PORCUPINE MINES OF THE NEW SILVER COUNTRY NEAR THE HUDSON BAY
460-172359-0001 THERE WERE ALWAYS PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP MULLINS THE MANAGER OF THE EXCHANGE BANK TOOK HIS MORNING SHAVE FROM JEFF AS A FORM OF RESUSCITATION WITH ENOUGH WET TOWELS LAID ON HIS FACE TO STEW HIM AND WITH JEFF MOVING ABOUT IN THE STEAM RAZOR IN HAND
460-172359-0002 AS GRAVE AS AN OPERATING SURGEON THEN AS I THINK I SAID MISTER SMITH CAME IN EVERY MORNING AND THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS OUTPOURING OF FLORIDA WATER AND RUMS ESSENCES AND REVIVERS AND RENOVATORS REGARDLESS OF EXPENSE
460-172359-0003 WHAT WITH JEFF'S WHITE COAT AND MISTER SMITH'S FLOWERED WAISTCOAT AND THE RED GERANIUM IN THE WINDOW AND THE FLORIDA WATER AND THE DOUBLE EXTRACT OF HYACINTH THE LITTLE SHOP SEEMED MULTI COLOURED AND LUXURIOUS ENOUGH FOR THE ANNEX OF A SULTAN'S HAREM BUT WHAT I MEAN IS THAT
460-172359-0004 TILL THE MINING BOOM JEFFERSON THORPE NEVER OCCUPIED A POSITION OF REAL PROMINENCE IN MARIPOSA
460-172359-0005 EVERYBODY KNEW JEFF AND LIKED HIM BUT THE ODD THING WAS THAT TILL HE MADE MONEY NOBODY TOOK ANY STOCK IN HIS IDEAS AT ALL IT WAS ONLY AFTER HE MADE THE CLEAN UP THAT THEY CAME TO SEE WHAT A SPLENDID FELLOW HE WAS LEVEL HEADED I THINK WAS THE TERM INDEED
460-172359-0006 IN THE SPEECH OF MARIPOSA THE HIGHEST FORM OF ENDOWMENT WAS TO HAVE THE HEAD SET ON HORIZONTALLY AS WITH A THEODOLITE AS I SAY IT WAS WHEN JEFF MADE MONEY THAT THEY SAW HOW GIFTED HE WAS AND WHEN HE LOST IT BUT STILL THERE'S NO NEED TO GO INTO THAT
460-172359-0007 I BELIEVE IT'S SOMETHING THE SAME IN OTHER PLACES TOO THE BARBER SHOP YOU WILL REMEMBER STANDS ACROSS THE STREET FROM SMITH'S HOTEL AND STARES AT IT FACE TO FACE IT IS ONE OF THOSE WOODEN STRUCTURES I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THEM
460-172359-0008 WITH A FALSE FRONT THAT STICKS UP ABOVE ITS REAL HEIGHT AND GIVES IT AN AIR AT ONCE RECTANGULAR AND IMPOSING IT IS A FORM OF ARCHITECTURE MUCH USED IN MARIPOSA AND UNDERSTOOD TO BE IN KEEPING WITH THE PRETENTIOUS AND ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER OF MODERN BUSINESS
460-172359-0009 AND THE SHOP ITSELF HAS A LARGE SQUARE WINDOW OUT OF PROPORTION TO ITS LITTLE FLAT FACE PAINTED ON THE PANES OF THE WINDOW IS THE REMAINS OF A LEGEND THAT ONCE SPELT BARBER SHOP EXECUTED WITH THE FLOURISHES THAT PREVAILED IN THE GOLDEN AGE OF SIGN PAINTING IN MARIPOSA
460-172359-0010 THROUGH THE WINDOW YOU CAN SEE THE GERANIUMS IN THE WINDOW SHELF AND BEHIND THEM JEFF THORPE WITH HIS LITTLE BLACK SCULL CAP ON AND HIS SPECTACLES DROOPED UPON HIS NOSE AS HE BENDS FORWARD IN THE ABSORPTION OF SHAVING
460-172359-0011 AS YOU OPEN THE DOOR IT SETS IN VIOLENT AGITATION A COILED SPRING UP ABOVE AND A BELL THAT ALMOST RINGS INSIDE THERE ARE TWO SHAVING CHAIRS OF THE HEAVIER OR ELECTROCUTION PATTERN
460-172359-0012 IT IS THE CURRENT SUPPOSITION OF EACH OF JEFF'S CUSTOMERS THAT EVERYONE ELSE BUT HIMSELF USES A SEPARATE MUG ONE CORNER OF THE SHOP IS PARTITIONED OFF AND BEARS THE SIGN HOT AND COLD BATHS FIFTY CENTS
460-172359-0013 ONLY OLD NEWSPAPERS AND A MOP STILL IT LENDS DISTINCTION SOMEHOW JUST AS DO THE FADED CARDBOARD SIGNS THAT HANG AGAINST THE MIRROR WITH THE LEGENDS TURKISH SHAMPOO SEVENTY FIVE CENTS AND ROMAN MASSAGE ONE DOLLAR
460-172359-0014 THEY SAID COMMONLY IN MARIPOSA THAT JEFF MADE MONEY OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP HE MAY HAVE AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN THAT THAT TURNED HIS MIND TO INVESTMENT BUT IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD A SHAVE COST FIVE CENTS AND A HAIR CUT FIFTEEN OR THE TWO IF YOU LIKED FOR A QUARTER
460-172359-0015 AND AT THAT IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD MAKE MONEY
460-172359-0016 AND THEN IN THE OTHER YOU SEE IN MARIPOSA SHAVING ISN'T THE HURRIED PERFUNCTORY THING THAT IT IS IN THE CITY A SHAVE IS LOOKED UPON AS A FORM OF PHYSICAL PLEASURE AND LASTS ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR IN THE MORNING HOURS PERHAPS THERE WAS A SEMBLANCE OF HASTE ABOUT IT
460-172359-0017 THE RAZOR WOULD GO SLOWER AND SLOWER AND PAUSE AND STOP MOVE AND PAUSE AGAIN TILL THE SHAVE DIED AWAY INTO THE MERE DROWSE OF CONVERSATION AT SUCH HOURS THE MARIPOSA BARBER SHOP WOULD BECOME A VERY PALACE OF SLUMBER
460-172359-0018 AND AS YOU WAITED YOUR TURN IN ONE OF THE WOODEN ARM CHAIRS BESIDE THE WALL WHAT WITH THE QUIET OF THE HOUR AND THE LOW DRONE OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION THE BUZZING OF THE FLIES AGAINST THE WINDOW PANE AND THE MEASURED TICK OF THE CLOCK ABOVE THE MIRROR
460-172359-0019 YOUR HEAD SANK DREAMING ON YOUR BREAST AND THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET RUSTLED UNHEEDED ON THE FLOOR IT MAKES ONE DROWSY JUST TO THINK OF IT THE CONVERSATION OF COURSE WAS THE REAL CHARM OF THE PLACE YOU SEE JEFFERSON'S FORTE OR SPECIALTY WAS INFORMATION
460-172359-0020 WHERE HE GOT IT ALL I DON'T KNOW BUT I AM INCLINED TO THINK IT CAME MORE OR LESS OUT OF THE NEWSPAPERS IN THE CITY PEOPLE NEVER READ THE NEWSPAPERS NOT REALLY ONLY LITTLE BITS AND SCRAPS OF THEM BUT IN MARIPOSA IT'S DIFFERENT THERE
460-172359-0021 THEY READ THE WHOLE THING FROM COVER TO COVER AND THEY BUILD UP ON IT IN THE COURSE OF YEARS A RANGE OF ACQUIREMENT THAT WOULD PUT A COLLEGE PRESIDENT TO THE BLUSH
460-172359-0022 AND OF COURSE THE PECULIARITY OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION WAS THAT HE COULD SUIT IT TO HIS MAN EVERY TIME
460-172359-0023 THERE WAS A CERTAIN KIND OF MAN THAT JEFF WOULD SIZE UP SIDEWAYS AS HE STROPPED THE RAZOR AND IN WHOSE EAR HE WOULD WHISPER I SEE WHERE SAINT LOUIS HAS TOOK FOUR STRAIGHT GAMES OFF CHICAGO AND SO HOLD HIM FASCINATED TO THE END IN THE SAME WAY HE WOULD SAY TO MISTER SMITH
460-172359-0024 I SEE WHERE IT SAYS THAT THIS FLYING SQUIRL RUN A DEAD HEAT FOR THE KING'S PLATE TO A HUMBLE INTELLECT LIKE MINE HE WOULD EXPLAIN IN FULL THE RELATIONS OF THE KEESAR TO THE GERMAN RICH DOG
460-172359-0025 THE HUGE FORTUNES THAT A MAN WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF HEAD COULD MAKE I'VE KNOWN JEFFERSON TO PAUSE IN HIS SHAVING WITH THE RAZOR SUSPENDED IN THE AIR AS LONG AS FIVE MINUTES WHILE HE DESCRIBED WITH HIS EYE HALF CLOSED
460-172359-0026 EXACTLY THE KIND OF A HEAD A MAN NEEDED IN ORDER TO MAKE A HAUL OR A CLEAN UP IT WAS EVIDENTLY SIMPLY A MATTER OF THE HEAD AND AS FAR AS ONE COULD JUDGE JEFF'S OWN WAS THE VERY TYPE REQUIRED I DON'T KNOW JUST AT WHAT TIME OR HOW JEFFERSON FIRST BEGAN HIS SPECULATIVE ENTERPRISES
460-172359-0027 IT WAS PROBABLY IN HIM FROM THE START THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE VERY IDEA OF SUCH THINGS AS TRACTION STOCK AND AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS WENT TO HIS HEAD AND WHENEVER HE SPOKE OF MISTER CARNEGIE AND MISTER ROCKEFELLER THE YEARNING TONE OF HIS VOICE MADE IT AS SOFT AS LATHERED SOAP
460-172359-0028 I SUPPOSE THE MOST RUDIMENTARY FORM OF HIS SPECULATION WAS THE HENS THAT WAS YEARS AGO HE KEPT THEM OUT AT THE BACK OF HIS HOUSE WHICH ITSELF STOOD UP A GRASS PLOT BEHIND AND BEYOND THE BARBER SHOP AND IN THE OLD DAYS JEFF WOULD SAY WITH A CERTAIN NOTE OF PRIDE IN HIS VOICE
460-172359-0029 THAT THE WOMAN HAD SOLD AS MANY AS TWO DOZEN EGGS IN A DAY TO THE SUMMER VISITORS BUT WHAT WITH READING ABOUT AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS AND CONSOLIDATED COPPER AND ALL THAT THE HENS BEGAN TO SEEM PRETTY SMALL BUSINESS AND IN ANY CASE THE IDEA OF TWO DOZEN EGGS AT A CENT APIECE ALMOST MAKES ONE BLUSH
460-172359-0030 I SUPPOSE A GOOD MANY OF US HAVE FELT JUST AS JEFF DID ABOUT OUR POOR LITTLE EARNINGS ANYWAY I REMEMBER JEFF TELLING ME ONE DAY THAT HE COULD TAKE THE WHOLE LOT OF THE HENS AND SELL THEM OFF AND CRACK THE MONEY INTO CHICAGO WHEAT ON MARGIN AND TURN IT OVER IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE DID IT TOO
460-172359-0031 AFTER THAT THE HEN HOUSE STOOD EMPTY AND THE WOMAN HAD TO THROW AWAY CHICKEN FEED EVERY DAY AT A DEAD LOSS OF PERHAPS A SHAVE AND A HALF
460-172359-0032 AND RIGHT AT OUR VERY DOORS YOU COULD SEE AS I SAW THE NIGHT EXPRESS GOING NORTH EVERY EVENING FOR ALL ONE KNEW ROCKEFELLER OR CARNEGIE OR ANYONE MIGHT BE ON IT
460-172359-0033 SO NO WONDER THE TOWN WENT WILD ALL DAY IN THE STREET YOU COULD HEAR MEN TALKING OF VEINS AND SMELTERS AND DIPS AND DEPOSITS AND FAULTS THE TOWN HUMMED WITH IT LIKE A GEOLOGY CLASS ON EXAMINATION DAY
460-172359-0034 WITHIN A FORTNIGHT THEY PUT A PARTITION DOWN ROBERTSON'S COAL AND WOOD OFFICE AND OPENED THE MARIPOSA MINING EXCHANGE AND JUST ABOUT EVERY MAN ON THE MAIN STREET STARTED BUYING SCRIP THEN PRESENTLY YOUNG FIZZLECHIP WHO HAD BEEN TELLER IN MULLINS'S BANK AND THAT EVERYBODY HAD THOUGHT A WORTHLESS JACKASS BEFORE
460-172359-0035 CAME BACK FROM THE COBALT COUNTRY WITH A FORTUNE AND LOAFED ROUND IN THE MARIPOSA HOUSE IN ENGLISH KHAKI AND A HORIZONTAL HAT DRUNK ALL THE TIME
460-172359-0036 THEY ALL WENT IN JIM ELIOT MORTGAGED THE INSIDE OF THE DRUG STORE AND JAMMED IT INTO TWIN TAMAGAMI PETE GLOVER AT THE HARDWARE STORE BOUGHT NIPPEWA STOCK AT THIRTEEN CENTS AND SOLD IT TO HIS BROTHER AT SEVENTEEN AND BOUGHT IT BACK IN LESS THAN A WEEK AT NINETEEN THEY DIDN'T CARE THEY TOOK A CHANCE
460-172359-0037 JUDGE PEPPERLEIGH PUT THE REST OF HIS WIFE'S MONEY INTO TEMISKAMING COMMON AND LAWYER MACARTNEY GOT THE FEVER TOO AND PUT EVERY CENT THAT HIS SISTER POSSESSED INTO TULIP PREFERRED AND EVEN WHEN YOUNG FIZZLECHIP SHOT HIMSELF IN THE BACK ROOM OF THE MARIPOSA HOUSE MISTER GINGHAM BURIED HIM IN A CASKET WITH SILVER HANDLES
460-172359-0038 THEY ALL WENT IN OR ALL EXCEPT MISTER SMITH YOU SEE MISTER SMITH HAD COME DOWN FROM THERE AND HE KNEW ALL ABOUT ROCKS AND MINING AND CANOES AND THE NORTH COUNTRY HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS TO EAT FLOUR BAKED DAMPERS UNDER THE LEE SIDE OF A CANOE PROPPED AMONG THE UNDERBRUSH
460-172359-0039 BUT JEFF THORPE WAS IN THE MINING BOOM RIGHT FROM THE START HE BOUGHT IN ON THE NIPPEWA MINE EVEN BEFORE THE INTERIM PROSPECTUS WAS OUT
460-172359-0040 AND HE AND JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLEKEEPER NEXT DOOR FORMED A SYNDICATE
460-172359-0041 AND THEN UNLOADED THEM ON ONE OF THE SAUSAGE MEN AT NETLEY'S BUTCHER SHOP AT A CLEAR CENT PER CENT ADVANCE JEFF WOULD OPEN THE LITTLE DRAWER BELOW THE MIRROR IN THE BARBER SHOP AND SHOW YOU ALL KINDS AND SORTS OF COBALT COUNTRY MINING CERTIFICATES
460-172359-0042 BLUE ONES PINK ONES GREEN ONES WITH OUTLANDISH AND FASCINATING NAMES ON THEM THAT RAN CLEAR FROM THE MATTAWA TO THE HUDSON BAY AND RIGHT FROM THE START HE WAS CONFIDENT OF WINNING THERE AIN'T NO DIFFICULTY TO IT HE SAID
460-172359-0043 I DON'T SAY HE USED TO CONTINUE WITH THE SCISSORS OPEN AND READY TO CUT
460-172359-0044 BUT IF A FELLER KNOWS THE COUNTRY AND KEEPS HIS HEAD LEVEL HE CAN'T LOSE JEFFERSON HAD LOOKED AT SO MANY PROSPECTUSES AND SO MANY PICTURES OF MINES AND PINE TREES AND SMELTERS THAT I THINK HE'D FORGOTTEN THAT HE'D NEVER BEEN IN THE COUNTRY ANYWAY WHAT'S TWO HUNDRED MILES
460-172359-0045 TO AN ONLOOKER IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T SEEM SO SIMPLE I NEVER KNEW THE MEANNESS THE TRICKERY OF THE MINING BUSINESS THE SHEER OBSTINATE DETERMINATION OF THE BIGGER CAPITALISTS NOT TO MAKE MONEY WHEN THEY MIGHT TILL I HEARD THE ACCOUNTS OF JEFF'S DIFFERENT MINES TAKE THE CASE OF CORONA JEWEL
460-172359-0046 THERE WAS A GOOD MINE SIMPLY GOING TO RUIN FOR LACK OF COMMON SENSE SHE AIN'T BEEN DEVELOPED JEFF WOULD SAY THERE'S SILVER ENOUGH IN HER SO YOU COULD DIG IT OUT WITH A SHOVEL SHE'S FULL OF IT BUT THEY WON'T GET AT HER AND WORK HER
460-172359-0047 THEN HE'D TAKE A LOOK AT THE PINK AND BLUE CERTIFICATES OF THE CORONA JEWEL AND SLAM THE DRAWER ON THEM IN DISGUST WORSE THAN THAT WAS THE SILENT PINE A CLEAR CASE OF STUPID INCOMPETENCE
460-172359-0048 UTTER LACK OF ENGINEERING SKILL WAS ALL THAT WAS KEEPING THE SILENT PINE FROM MAKING A FORTUNE FOR ITS HOLDERS THE ONLY TROUBLE WITH THAT MINE SAID JEFF IS THEY WON'T GO DEEP ENOUGH
460-172359-0049 IF THEY'D JUST GO RIGHT INTO HER GOOD THEY'D GET IT AGAIN SHE'S DOWN THERE ALL RIGHT BUT PERHAPS THE MEANEST CASE OF ALL WAS THE NORTHERN STAR THAT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME EVERY TIME I HEARD OF IT A STRAIGHT CASE FOR THE CRIMINAL LAW THE THING WAS SO EVIDENTLY A CONSPIRACY
460-172359-0050 I BOUGHT HER SAID JEFF AT THIRTY TWO AND SHE STAYED RIGHT THERE TIGHT LIKE SHE WAS STUCK
460-172359-0051 AND I HELD ON TO HER AND THEY SHOVED HER DOWN TO TWENTY ONE THIS MORNING THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO SIXTEEN BUT I DON'T MEAN TO LET GO NO SIR IN ANOTHER FORTNIGHT THEY SHOVED HER THE SAME UNSCRUPULOUS CROWD DOWN TO NINE CENTS AND JEFFERSON STILL HELD ON
460-172359-0052 A FEW DAYS AFTER THAT THE SAME CRIMINAL GANG HAD HER DOWN FURTHER THAN EVER THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO THREE CENTS SAID JEFF BUT I'M WITH HER YES SIR THEY THINK THEY CAN SHOVE HER CLEAN OFF THE MARKET BUT THEY CAN'T DO IT I'VE BOUGHTEN IN JOHNSON'S SHARES
460-172359-0053 AND THEN AND THEN WELL THAT'S JUST THE QUEER THING ABOUT THE MINING BUSINESS WHY SUDDEN AS A FLASH OF LIGHTNING IT SEEMED THE NEWS CAME OVER THE WIRE TO THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET THAT THEY HAD STRUCK A VEIN OF SILVER IN THE NORTHERN STAR AS THICK AS A SIDEWALK
460-172359-0054 AND THAT THE STOCK HAD JUMPED TO SEVENTEEN DOLLARS A SHARE AND EVEN AT THAT YOU COULDN'T GET IT AND JEFF STOOD THERE FLUSHED AND HALF STAGGERED AGAINST THE MIRROR OF THE LITTLE SHOP WITH A BUNCH OF MINING SCRIP IN HIS HAND THAT WAS WORTH FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
460-172359-0055 EXCITEMENT IT WAS ALL OVER THE TOWN IN A MINUTES
460-172359-0056 AND IN LESS THAN NO TIME THERE WASN'T STANDING ROOM IN THE BARBER SHOP AND OVER IN SMITH'S HOTEL THEY HAD THREE EXTRA BARKEEPERS WORKING ON THE LAGER BEER PUMPS
460-172359-0057 AND PEOPLE WERE JUST CLUTCHING FOR THEM THEN AT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG OYSTER SUPPER IN SMITH'S CAFF WITH SPEECHES AND THE MARIPOSA BAND OUTSIDE AND THE QUEER THING WAS THAT THE VERY NEXT AFTERNOON WAS THE FUNERAL OF YOUNG FIZZLECHIP
460-172359-0058 A PERFECT ILIAD WHILE HE WAS CLINGING TO HER THE WHOLE THING WAS IN THE CITY PAPERS A FEW DAYS AFTER WITH A PHOTOGRAPH OF JEFF TAKEN SPECIALLY AT ED MOORE'S STUDIO UPSTAIRS OVER NETLEY'S IT SHOWED JEFF SITTING AMONG PALM TREES AS ALL MINING MEN DO
460-172359-0059 WITH ONE HAND ON HIS KNEE AND A DOG ONE OF THOSE REGULAR MINING DOGS AT HIS FEET AND A LOOK OF PIERCING INTELLIGENCE IN HIS FACE THAT WOULD EASILY ACCOUNT FOR FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I SAY THAT THE RECOGNITION MEANT A LOT TO JEFF FOR ITS OWN SAKE
460-172359-0060 THAT UNLESS YOU HEAR ABOUT THEM SEPARATELY AND ONE BY ONE YOU CAN'T FOR A MOMENT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE LIKE
460-172359-0061 ON HER HIGH STOOL WITH A STEEL CAP ON JABBING THE CONNECTING PLUGS IN AND OUT AS IF ELECTRICITY COST NOTHING WELL
460-172359-0062 THERE WAS MYRA WHO TREATED LOVERS LIKE DOGS AND WOULD SLAP THEM ACROSS THE FACE WITH A BANANA SKIN TO SHOW HER UTTER INDEPENDENCE AND THERE WAS MISS CLEGHORN WHO WAS SALLOW AND WHO BOUGHT A FORTY CENT ANCIENT HISTORY TO IMPROVE HERSELF AND YET IF SHE'D HIT ANY MAN IN MARIPOSA WITH A BANANA SKIN
460-172359-0063 HE'D HAVE HAD HER ARRESTED FOR ASSAULT MIND YOU I DON'T MEAN THAT MYRA WAS MERELY FLIPPANT AND WORTHLESS NOT AT ALL SHE WAS A GIRL WITH ANY AMOUNT OF TALENT YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD HER RECITE THE RAVEN AT THE METHODIST SOCIAL SIMPLY GENIUS
460-172359-0064 AND WHEN SHE ACTED PORTIA IN THE TRIAL SCENE OF THE MERCHANT OF VENICE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL CONCERT
460-172359-0065 SO OF COURSE AS SOON AS JEFF MADE THE FORTUNE MYRA HAD HER RESIGNATION IN NEXT MORNING
460-172359-0066 AND BECOME A LEADING ACTRESS BUT AS I SAID THE PUBLIC RECOGNITION COUNTED A LOT FOR JEFF THE MOMENT YOU BEGIN TO GET THAT SORT OF THING IT COMES IN QUICKLY ENOUGH BRAINS YOU KNOW ARE RECOGNIZED RIGHT AWAY THAT WAS WHY OF COURSE WITHIN A WEEK FROM THIS
460-172359-0067 JEFF RECEIVED THE FIRST BIG PACKET OF STUFF FROM THE CUBAN LAND DEVELOPMENT COMPANY WITH COLOURED PICTURES OF CUBA AND FIELDS OF BANANAS AND HACIENDAS AND INSURRECTOS WITH MACHETES AND HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT THEY HEARD OF HIM SOMEHOW IT WASN'T FOR A MODEST MAN LIKE JEFFERSON TO SAY HOW
460-172359-0068 FOR ALL I KNOW THIS CUBAN STUFF MAY HAVE BEEN SENT FROM MORGAN HIMSELF SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN MARIPOSA SAID YES OTHERS SAID NO THERE WAS NO CERTAINTY ANYWAY THEY WERE FAIR AND STRAIGHT THIS CUBAN CROWD THAT WROTE TO JEFF
460-172359-0069 AND THAT TOUCHES YOU NO THEY ASKED NO GUARANTEE JUST SEND THE MONEY WHETHER BY EXPRESS ORDER OR BY BANK DRAFT OR CHEQUE THEY LEFT THAT ENTIRELY TO ONESELF AS A MATTER BETWEEN CUBAN GENTLEMEN AND THEY WERE QUITE FRANK ABOUT THEIR ENTERPRISE
460-172359-0070 BANANAS AND TOBACCO IN THE PLANTATION DISTRICT RECLAIMED FROM THE INSURRECTOS YOU COULD SEE IT ALL THERE IN THE PICTURES
460-172359-0071 THEY MADE NO RASH PROMISES JUST ADMITTED STRAIGHT OUT THAT THE ENTERPRISE MIGHT REALISE FOUR HUNDRED PER CENT
460-172359-0072 I LIKED IT ABOUT JEFF THAT HE DIDN'T STOP SHAVING HE WENT ON JUST THE SAME EVEN WHEN JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLE MAN CAME IN WITH FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND ASKED HIM TO SEE IF THE CUBAN BOARD OF DIRECTORS WOULD LET HIM PUT IT IN JEFF LAID IT IN THE DRAWER AND THEN SHAVED HIM FOR FIVE CENTS IN THE SAME OLD WAY
460-172359-0073 A FEW DAYS LATER HE GOT A LETTER FROM THE CUBAN PEOPLE FROM NEW YORK ACCEPTING THE MONEY STRAIGHT OFF WITHOUT A SINGLE QUESTION AND WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING MORE OF JOHNSON EXCEPT THAT HE WAS A FRIEND OF JEFF'S THEY WROTE MOST HANDSOMELY ANY FRIENDS OF JEFF'S WERE FRIENDS OF CUBA
460-172359-0074 ALL MONEY THEY MIGHT SEND WOULD BE TREATED JUST AS JEFF'S WOULD BE TREATED ONE REASON PERHAPS WHY JEFF DIDN'T GIVE UP SHAVING WAS BECAUSE IT ALLOWED HIM TO TALK ABOUT CUBA
460-172359-0075 AND THAT SPREAD ROUND HIM A KIND OF HALO OF WEALTH AND MYSTERY AND OUTLANDISHNESS OH SOMETHING SPANISH PERHAPS YOU'VE FELT IT ABOUT PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW ANYHOW THEY ASKED HIM ABOUT THE CLIMATE AND YELLOW FEVER AND WHAT THE NEGROES WERE LIKE AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
460-172359-0076 AND FOR FRUIT THEY SAY IT COMES UP SO FAST YOU CAN'T STOP IT AND THEN HE WOULD PASS INTO DETAILS ABOUT THE HASH ENDERS AND THE RESURRECTOS AND TECHNICAL THINGS LIKE THAT TILL IT WAS THOUGHT A WONDER HOW HE COULD KNOW IT STILL IT WAS REALIZED THAT A MAN WITH MONEY HAS GOT TO KNOW THESE THINGS
460-172359-0077 LOOK AT MORGAN AND ROCKEFELLER AND ALL THE MEN THAT MAKE A PILE THEY KNOW JUST AS MUCH AS JEFF DID ABOUT THE COUNTRIES WHERE THEY MAKE IT IT STANDS TO REASON DID I SAY THAT JEFF SHAVED IN THE SAME OLD WAY NOT QUITE
460-172359-0078 I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS GETTING SO MUCH MONEY WELL YOU KNOW THE WAY IT ACTS ON PEOPLE IN THE LARGER CITIES IT SEEMED TO SPOIL ONE'S IDEA OF JEFF THAT COPPER AND ASBESTOS AND BANANA LANDS SHOULD FORM THE GOAL OF HIS THOUGHT WHEN IF HE KNEW IT
460-172359-0079 IN FACT I HAD PERHAPS BORNE HIM A GRUDGE FOR WHAT SEEMED TO ME HIS PERPETUAL INTEREST IN THE GREAT CAPITALISTS HE ALWAYS HAD SOME ITEM OUT OF THE PAPER ABOUT THEM
460-172359-0080 HE WOULD SAY AND ANOTHER DAY HE WOULD PAUSE IN THE COURSE OF SHAVING AND ALMOST WHISPER DID YOU EVER SEE THIS ROCKEFELLER IT WAS ONLY BY A SORT OF ACCIDENT THAT I CAME TO KNOW THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER SIDE TO JEFFERSON'S SPECULATION THAT NO ONE IN MARIPOSA EVER KNEW OR WILL EVER KNOW NOW
460-172359-0081 YOU COULD SEE THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP BEHIND THE BLIND AND THROUGH THE SCREEN DOOR AS YOU CAME ALONG
460-172359-0082 THERE WAS A ROUND TABLE THAT THE WOMAN USED TO LAY FOR SUPPER
460-172359-0083 AND BESIDE IT JEFF WOULD SIT WITH HIS SPECTACLES ON AND THE PAPER SPREAD OUT READING ABOUT CARNEGIE AND ROCKEFELLER NEAR HIM BUT AWAY FROM THE TABLE WAS THE WOMAN DOING NEEDLEWORK AND MYRA WHEN SHE WASN'T WORKING IN THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE WAS THERE TOO WITH HER ELBOWS ON THE TABLE READING MARIE CORELLI
460-172359-0084 JEFF LAID DOWN WHAT HE WAS READING AND STARTED TO TALK ABOUT CARNEGIE THIS CARNEGIE I BET YOU WOULD BE WORTH SAID JEFF CLOSING UP HIS EYES IN CALCULATION AS MUCH AS PERHAPS TWO MILLION DOLLARS IF YOU WAS TO SELL HIM UP
460-172359-0085 I MAY SAY IN PARENTHESES THAT IT WAS A FAVOURITE METHOD IN MARIPOSA IF YOU WANTED TO GET AT THE REAL WORTH OF A MAN TO IMAGINE HIM CLEAN SOLD UP PUT UP FOR AUCTION AS IT WERE IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO TEST HIM AND NOW LOOK AT EM JEFF WENT ON
460-172359-0086 THEY GIVE IT AWAY AND WHO DO THEY GIVE IT TO WHY TO THOSE AS DON'T WANT IT EVERY TIME THEY GIVE IT TO THESE PROFESSORS AND TO THIS RESEARCH AND THAT AND DO THE POOR GET ANY OF IT NOT A CENT AND NEVER WILL I TELL YOU BOYS CONTINUED JEFF
460-172359-0087 THERE WERE NO BOYS PRESENT BUT IN MARIPOSA ALL REALLY IMPORTANT SPEECHES ARE ADDRESSED TO AN IMAGINARY AUDIENCE OF BOYS I TELL YOU IF I WAS TO MAKE A MILLION OUT OF THIS CUBEY I'D GIVE IT STRAIGHT TO THE POOR YES SIR DIVIDE IT UP INTO A HUNDRED LOTS OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH AND GIVE IT TO THE PEOPLE THAT HADN'T NOTHING
460-172359-0088 SO ALWAYS AFTER THAT I KNEW JUST WHAT THOSE BANANAS WERE BEING GROWN FOR INDEED AFTER THAT THOUGH JEFFERSON NEVER SPOKE OF HIS INTENTIONS DIRECTLY HE SAID A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT SEEMED TO BEAR ON THEM
460-172359-0089 HE ASKED ME FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY HOW MANY BLIND PEOPLE IT WOULD TAKE TO FILL ONE OF THESE BLIND HOMES AND HOW A FELLER COULD GET AHOLD OF THEM
460-172359-0090 A FELLER COULD GET ENOUGH OF THEM TO MAKE A SHOWING
460-172359-0091 BUT STILL WHAT'S THE USE OF TALKING OF WHAT JEFF MEANT TO DO NOBODY KNOWS OR CARES ABOUT IT NOW THE END OF IT WAS BOUND TO COME EVEN IN MARIPOSA SOME OF THE PEOPLE MUST HAVE THOUGHT SO
460-172359-0092 ELSE HOW WAS IT THAT HENRY MULLINS MADE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT SELLING A DRAFT FOR FORTY THOUSAND ON NEW YORK AND WHY WAS IT THAT MISTER SMITH WOULDN'T PAY BILLY THE DESK CLERK HIS BACK WAGES WHEN HE WANTED TO PUT IT INTO CUBA OH YES SOME OF THEM MUST HAVE SEEN IT
460-172359-0093 AND YET WHEN IT CAME IT SEEMED SO QUIET EVER SO QUIET NOT A BIT LIKE THE NORTHERN STAR MINE AND THE OYSTER SUPPER AND THE MARIPOSA BAND IT IS STRANGE HOW QUIET THESE THINGS LOOK THE OTHER WAY ROUND
460-172359-0094 YOU REMEMBER THE CUBAN LAND FRAUDS IN NEW YORK AND PORFORIO GOMEZ SHOOTING THE DETECTIVE AND HIM AND MAXIMO MOREZ GETTING CLEAR AWAY WITH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND NO OF COURSE YOU DON'T WHY EVEN IN THE CITY PAPERS IT ONLY FILLED AN INCH OR TWO OF TYPE AND ANYWAY THE NAMES WERE HARD TO REMEMBER
460-172359-0095 THAT WAS JEFF'S MONEY PART OF IT MULLINS GOT THE TELEGRAM FROM A BROKER OR SOMEONE AND HE SHOWED IT TO JEFF JUST AS HE WAS GOING UP THE STREET WITH AN ESTATE AGENT TO LOOK AT A BIG EMPTY LOT ON THE HILL BEHIND THE TOWN THE VERY PLACE FOR THESE INCURABLES
460-172359-0096 AND JEFF WENT BACK TO THE SHOP SO QUIET HAVE YOU EVER SEEN AN ANIMAL THAT IS STRICKEN THROUGH HOW QUIET IT SEEMS TO MOVE
460-172359-0097 AND SINCE THAT THOUGH IT'S QUITE A LITTLE WHILE AGO THE SHOP'S OPEN TILL ELEVEN EVERY NIGHT NOW AND JEFF IS SHAVING AWAY TO PAY BACK THAT FIVE HUNDRED THAT JOHNSON THE LIVERY MAN SENT TO THE CUBANS AND PATHETIC TUT TUT YOU DON'T KNOW MARIPOSA
460-172359-0098 JEFF HAS TO WORK PRETTY LATE BUT THAT'S NOTHING NOTHING AT ALL IF YOU'VE WORKED HARD ALL YOUR LIFETIME
460-172359-0099 THEY WERE GLAD ENOUGH TO GET HER AND SHE SAYS NOW THAT IF THERE'S ONE THING SHE HATES IT'S THE STAGE AND SHE CAN'T SEE HOW THE ACTRESSES PUT UP WITH IT ANYWAY THINGS ARE NOT SO BAD
4640-19187-0000 AND JUNE EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT KNEW A GREAT DEAL MORE ABOUT IT THAN JUNE EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO SO THE BARRICADE OF THE
4640-19187-0001 AND AN EMBRYO COMPARED TO THE TWO COLOSSAL BARRICADES WHICH WE HAVE JUST SKETCHED BUT IT WAS FORMIDABLE FOR THAT EPOCH
4640-19187-0002 ALL SORTS OF RUBBISH BROUGHT AND ADDED FROM ALL DIRECTIONS COMPLICATED THE EXTERNAL CONFUSION THE REDOUBT HAD BEEN CLEVERLY MADE OVER INTO A WALL ON THE INSIDE AND A THICKET ON THE OUTSIDE
4640-19187-0003 THE STAIRCASE OF PAVING STONES WHICH PERMITTED ONE TO MOUNT IT LIKE THE WALL OF A CITADEL HAD BEEN RECONSTRUCTED THE BARRICADE HAD BEEN PUT IN ORDER THE TAP ROOM DISENCUMBERED
4640-19187-0004 THE KITCHEN APPROPRIATED FOR THE AMBULANCE THE DRESSING OF THE WOUNDED COMPLETED THE POWDER SCATTERED ON THE GROUND AND ON THE TABLES HAD BEEN GATHERED UP
4640-19187-0005 WHICH ALLOWED THE INSURGENTS TO BREATHE MORE FREELY THEY HAD FOUND MEANS OF TAKING REFUGE IN SOME NEIGHBORING HOUSE THE GREATER PART OF THE WOUNDED WERE ABLE AND WISHED TO FIGHT STILL
4640-19187-0006 ON A LITTER OF MATTRESSES AND TRUSSES OF STRAW IN THE KITCHEN WHICH HAD BEEN CONVERTED INTO AN AMBULANCE THERE WERE FIVE MEN GRAVELY WOUNDED TWO OF WHOM WERE MUNICIPAL GUARDSMEN
4640-19187-0007 IN THE INTERIOR OF THIS HALL BARELY LIGHTED BY A CANDLE AT ONE END THE MORTUARY TABLE BEING BEHIND THE POST LIKE A HORIZONTAL BAR
4640-19187-0008 AND MABEUF LYING PRONE THE POLE OF THE OMNIBUS ALTHOUGH SNAPPED OFF BY THE FUSILLADE WAS STILL SUFFICIENTLY UPRIGHT TO ADMIT OF THEIR FASTENING THE FLAG TO IT
4640-19187-0009 THE FIFTY MEN IN THE BARRICADE HAD SPEEDILY EXHAUSTED THE SCANTY PROVISIONS OF THE WINE SHOP DURING THE SIXTEEN HOURS WHICH THEY HAD PASSED THERE
4640-19187-0010 THEY HAD THEN REACHED THE FIRST HOURS OF THAT SPARTAN DAY OF THE SIXTH OF JUNE WHEN IN THE BARRICADE SAINT MERRY JEANNE SURROUNDED BY THE INSURGENTS WHO DEMANDED BREAD REPLIED TO ALL COMBATANTS CRYING SOMETHING TO EAT
4640-19187-0011 WITH WHY
4640-19187-0012 AS THEY COULD NO LONGER EAT
4640-19187-0013 HE INTERDICTED WINE AND PORTIONED OUT THE BRANDY THEY HAD FOUND IN THE CELLAR FIFTEEN FULL BOTTLES HERMETICALLY SEALED
4640-19187-0014 AND IN ORDER THAT NO ONE MIGHT TOUCH THEM HE HAD THEM PLACED UNDER THE TABLE ON WHICH FATHER MABEUF WAS LYING ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THEY RECKONED UP THEIR STRENGTH THERE WERE STILL THIRTY SEVEN OF THEM
4640-19187-0015 THE DAY BEGAN TO DAWN THE TORCH WHICH HAD BEEN REPLACED IN ITS CAVITY IN THE PAVEMENT HAD JUST BEEN EXTINGUISHED THE INTERIOR OF THE BARRICADE THAT SPECIES OF TINY COURTYARD APPROPRIATED FROM THE STREET
4640-19187-0016 THAT TORCH FLICKERING IN THE WIND ANNOYED ME IT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF BEING AFRAID THE LIGHT OF TORCHES RESEMBLES THE WISDOM OF COWARDS IT GIVES A BAD LIGHT BECAUSE IT TREMBLES
4640-19187-0017 DAWN AWAKENS MINDS AS IT DOES THE BIRDS ALL BEGAN TO TALK JOLY PERCEIVING A CAT PROWLING ON A GUTTER EXTRACTED PHILOSOPHY FROM IT WHAT IS THE CAT HE EXCLAIMED
4640-19187-0018 IT IS A CORRECTIVE THE GOOD GOD HAVING MADE THE MOUSE SAID HULLO I HAVE COMMITTED A BLUNDER AND SO HE MADE THE CAT THE CAT IS THE ERRATUM OF THE MOUSE
4640-19187-0019 HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON BRUTUS CHEREAS STEPHANUS CROMWELL CHARLOTTE CORDAY SAND HAVE ALL HAD THEIR MOMENT OF AGONY WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE
4640-19187-0020 OUR HEARTS QUIVER SO AND HUMAN LIFE IS SUCH A MYSTERY THAT EVEN IN THE CASE OF A CIVIC MURDER EVEN IN A MURDER FOR LIBERATION IF THERE BE SUCH A THING
4640-19187-0021 THE REMORSE FOR HAVING STRUCK A MAN SURPASSES THE JOY OF HAVING SERVED THE HUMAN RACE AND SUCH ARE THE WINDINGS OF THE EXCHANGE OF SPEECH THAT A MOMENT LATER BY A TRANSITION BROUGHT ABOUT THROUGH JEAN PROUVAIRE'S VERSES
4640-19187-0022 COMBEFERRE WAS COMPARING THE TRANSLATORS OF THE GEORGICS
4640-19187-0023 COURNAND WITH DELILLE POINTING OUT THE PASSAGES TRANSLATED BY MALFILATRE PARTICULARLY THE PRODIGIES OF CAESAR'S DEATH AND AT THAT WORD CAESAR THE CONVERSATION REVERTED TO BRUTUS
4640-19187-0024 CAESAR SAID COMBEFERRE FELL JUSTLY CICERO WAS SEVERE TOWARDS CAESAR AND HE WAS RIGHT THAT SEVERITY IS NOT DIATRIBE
4640-19187-0025 WHEN MAEVIUS INSULTS VIRGIL WHEN VISE INSULTS MOLIERE WHEN POPE INSULTS SHAKSPEARE WHEN FREDERIC INSULTS VOLTAIRE IT IS AN OLD LAW OF ENVY AND HATRED WHICH IS BEING CARRIED OUT
4640-19187-0026 THE BLADE BUT ANTIQUITY ADMITTED IT CAESAR THE VIOLATOR OF THE RUBICON CONFERRING AS THOUGH THEY CAME FROM HIM THE DIGNITIES WHICH EMANATED FROM THE PEOPLE NOT RISING AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE SENATE
4640-19187-0027 COMMITTED THE ACTS OF A KING AND ALMOST OF A TYRANT
4640-19187-0028 CAESAR IS STABBED BY THE SENATORS CHRIST IS CUFFED BY LACKEYS ONE FEELS THE GOD THROUGH THE GREATER OUTRAGE
4640-19187-0029 HE HAD MADE HIS WAY OUT THROUGH MONDETOUR LANE GLIDING ALONG CLOSE TO THE HOUSES THE INSURGENTS WE WILL REMARK WERE FULL OF HOPE
4640-19187-0030 THAN AS TO THEIR CAUSE MOREOVER SUCCOR WAS EVIDENTLY ON THE WAY TO THEM THEY RECKONED ON IT WITH THAT FACILITY OF TRIUMPHANT PROPHECY WHICH IS ONE OF THE SOURCES OF STRENGTH IN THE FRENCH COMBATANT
4640-19187-0031 THEY DIVIDED THE DAY WHICH WAS AT HAND INTO THREE DISTINCT PHASES
4640-19187-0032 AT NOON THE INSURRECTION OF ALL PARIS AT SUNSET REVOLUTION
4640-19187-0033 WHICH RESEMBLED THE WARLIKE HUM OF A HIVE OF BEES
4640-19187-0034 HE RETURNED FROM HIS SOMBRE EAGLE FLIGHT INTO OUTER DARKNESS HE LISTENED FOR A MOMENT TO ALL THIS JOY WITH FOLDED ARMS AND ONE HAND ON HIS MOUTH THEN
4640-19187-0035 FRESH AND ROSY IN THE GROWING WHITENESS OF THE DAWN HE SAID THE WHOLE ARMY OF PARIS IS TO STRIKE A THIRD OF THE ARMY IS BEARING DOWN UPON THE BARRICADES IN WHICH YOU NOW ARE
4640-19187-0036 AS FOR THE POPULACE IT WAS SEETHING YESTERDAY TO DAY IT IS NOT STIRRING THERE IS NOTHING TO EXPECT NOTHING TO HOPE FOR NEITHER FROM A FAUBOURG NOR FROM A REGIMENT YOU ARE ABANDONED
4640-19187-0037 A MOMENT OF INDESCRIBABLE SILENCE ENSUED IN WHICH DEATH MIGHT HAVE BEEN HEARD FLITTING BY THIS MOMENT WAS BRIEF
4640-19187-0038 SO BE IT LET US RAISE THE BARRICADE TO A HEIGHT OF TWENTY FEET AND LET US ALL REMAIN IN IT CITIZENS LET US OFFER THE PROTESTS OF CORPSES
4640-19187-0039 IT WAS HAILED WITH AN ENTHUSIASTIC ACCLAMATION NO ONE EVER HAS KNOWN THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO SPOKE THUS HE WAS SOME UNKNOWN BLOUSE WEARER A STRANGER
4640-19187-0040 AT A GIVEN MOMENT UTTERS IN A SUPREME FASHION THE DECISIVE WORD AND WHO VANISHES INTO THE SHADOWS AFTER HAVING REPRESENTED FOR A MINUTE IN A LIGHTNING FLASH THE PEOPLE AND GOD
4640-19187-0041 LET US GET OURSELVES KILLED HERE TO THE VERY LAST MAN
4640-19188-0000 CHAPTER FOUR MINUS FIVE PLUS ONE
4640-19188-0001 STILL GREAT AS WAS THIS OMNIPOTENCE A MURMUR AROSE
4640-19188-0002 HE RESUMED HAUGHTILY LET THOSE WHO ARE AFRAID OF NOT NUMBERING MORE THAN THIRTY SAY SO THE MURMURS REDOUBLED
4640-19188-0003 YOU WOULD FALL IN WITH SOME GRAND GUARD OF THE LINE OR THE SUBURBS
4640-19188-0004 ENTERED THE TAP ROOM THEY EMERGED THENCE A MOMENT LATER
4640-19188-0005 COME SAID HE YOU MUST HAVE A LITTLE PITY DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE QUESTION IS HERE IT IS A QUESTION OF WOMEN SEE HERE ARE THERE WOMEN OR ARE THERE NOT ARE THERE CHILDREN OR ARE THERE NOT

4640-19188-0007 DIE IF YOU WILL BUT DON'T MAKE OTHERS DIE SUICIDES LIKE THAT WHICH IS ON THE BRINK OF ACCOMPLISHMENT HERE ARE SUBLIME BUT SUICIDE IS NARROW AND DOES NOT ADMIT OF EXTENSION
4640-19188-0008 AND AS SOON AS IT TOUCHES YOUR NEIGHBORS SUICIDE IS MURDER THINK OF THE LITTLE BLOND HEADS THINK OF THE WHITE LOCKS
4640-19188-0009 ON THE FIFTH FLOOR AND ON THE PANE THE QUIVERING SHADOW OF THE HEAD OF AN OLD WOMAN WHO HAD THE AIR OF HAVING SPENT THE NIGHT IN WATCHING PERHAPS SHE IS THE MOTHER OF SOME ONE OF YOU
4640-19188-0010 LET HIM FEEL AT EASE THE TASK HERE WILL BE PERFORMED ALL THE SAME WHEN ONE SUPPORTS ONE'S RELATIVES BY ONE'S TOIL ONE HAS NOT THE RIGHT TO SACRIFICE ONE'S SELF
4640-19188-0011 THAT IS DESERTING ONE'S FAMILY AND THOSE WHO HAVE DAUGHTERS WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF YOU GET YOURSELVES KILLED YOU ARE DEAD THAT IS WELL AND TOMORROW YOUNG GIRLS WITHOUT BREAD THAT IS A TERRIBLE THING
4640-19188-0012 WHO SING AND PRATTLE WHO ARE LIKE A LIVING PERFUME WHO PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF ANGELS IN HEAVEN BY THE PURITY OF VIRGINS ON EARTH
4640-19188-0013 THOSE ADORABLE AND HONEST CREATURES WHO ARE YOUR BLESSINGS AND YOUR PRIDE AH GOOD GOD THEY WILL SUFFER HUNGER WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY TO YOU
4640-19188-0014 THINK OF THE SHOPS PAST WHICH WOMEN GO AND COME WITH NECKS ALL BARE AND THROUGH THE MIRE THESE WOMEN TOO WERE PURE ONCE THINK OF YOUR SISTERS THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE THEM
4640-19188-0015 YOU ARE NO LONGER ON HAND THAT IS WELL YOU HAVE WISHED TO RELEASE THE PEOPLE FROM ROYALTY AND YOU DELIVER OVER YOUR DAUGHTERS TO THE POLICE FRIENDS HAVE A CARE HAVE MERCY
4640-19188-0016 WE PREVENT THEIR OCCUPYING THEMSELVES WITH POLITICS WILL YOU PREVENT THEM FROM GOING TO THE DEAD HOUSE THIS EVENING AND RECOGNIZING YOUR BODIES LET US SEE THOSE WHO HAVE FAMILIES MUST BE TRACTABLE
4640-19188-0017 AND SHAKE HANDS WITH US AND TAKE THEMSELVES OFF AND LEAVE US HERE ALONE TO ATTEND TO THIS AFFAIR I KNOW WELL THAT COURAGE IS REQUIRED TO LEAVE THAT IT IS HARD BUT THE HARDER IT IS THE MORE MERITORIOUS
4640-19188-0018 YOU SAY I HAVE A GUN I AM AT THE BARRICADE SO MUCH THE WORSE I SHALL REMAIN THERE SO MUCH THE WORSE IS EASILY SAID MY FRIENDS THERE IS A MORROW YOU WILL NOT BE HERE TO MORROW
4640-19188-0019 BUT YOUR FAMILIES WILL AND WHAT SUFFERINGS SEE HERE IS A PRETTY HEALTHY CHILD WITH CHEEKS LIKE AN APPLE WHO BABBLES PRATTLES CHATTERS WHO LAUGHS WHO SMELLS SWEET BENEATH YOUR KISS
4640-19188-0020 AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT BECOMES OF HIM WHEN HE IS ABANDONED I HAVE SEEN ONE A VERY SMALL CREATURE NO TALLER THAN THAT HIS FATHER WAS DEAD POOR PEOPLE HAD TAKEN HIM IN OUT OF CHARITY
4640-19188-0021 AND WHOSE PIPE YOU KNOW WAS OF MASTIC AND YELLOW CLAY HIS BREATHING WAS HOARSE HIS FACE LIVID HIS LIMBS FLACCID HIS BELLY PROMINENT HE SAID NOTHING IF YOU SPOKE TO HIM HE DID NOT ANSWER
4640-19188-0022 HE IS DEAD HE WAS TAKEN TO THE NECKER HOSPITAL WHERE I SAW HIM I WAS HOUSE SURGEON IN THAT HOSPITAL
4640-19188-0023 THAT POOR BRAT I REMEMBER AND I SEEM TO SEE HIM NOW WHEN HE LAY NUDE ON THE DISSECTING TABLE HOW HIS RIBS STOOD OUT ON HIS SKIN LIKE THE GRAVES BENEATH THE GRASS IN A CEMETERY
4640-19188-0024 STATISTICS SHOW THAT THE MORTALITY AMONG ABANDONED CHILDREN IS FIFTY FIVE PER CENT I REPEAT IT IS A QUESTION OF WOMEN IT CONCERNS MOTHERS IT CONCERNS YOUNG GIRLS IT CONCERNS LITTLE CHILDREN
4640-19188-0025 BUT YOU ARE NOT ALONE IN THIS WORLD THERE ARE OTHER BEINGS OF WHOM YOU MUST THINK YOU MUST NOT BE EGOISTS ALL DROPPED THEIR HEADS WITH A GLOOMY AIR
4640-19188-0026 STRANGE CONTRADICTIONS OF THE HUMAN HEART AT ITS MOST SUBLIME MOMENTS COMBEFERRE WHO SPOKE THUS WAS NOT AN ORPHAN HE RECALLED THE MOTHERS OF OTHER MEN AND FORGOT HIS OWN
4640-19188-0027 HE WAS ABOUT TO GET HIMSELF KILLED HE WAS AN EGOIST MARIUS FASTING FEVERED HAVING EMERGED IN SUCCESSION FROM ALL HOPE AND HAVING BEEN STRANDED IN GRIEF THE MOST SOMBRE OF SHIPWRECKS
4640-19188-0028 AND CLASSIFIED BY SCIENCE AND WHICH IS TO SUFFERING WHAT VOLUPTUOUSNESS IS TO PLEASURE DESPAIR ALSO HAS ITS ECSTASY MARIUS HAD REACHED THIS POINT
4640-19188-0029 HE BEHELD MEN GOING AND COMING AS THROUGH A FLAME HE HEARD VOICES SPEAKING AS AT THE BOTTOM OF AN ABYSS BUT THIS MOVED HIM THERE WAS IN THIS SCENE A POINT WHICH PIERCED AND ROUSED EVEN HIM
4640-19188-0030 HE HAD BUT ONE IDEA NOW TO DIE AND HE DID NOT WISH TO BE TURNED ASIDE FROM IT BUT HE REFLECTED IN HIS GLOOMY SOMNAMBULISM THAT WHILE DESTROYING HIMSELF
4640-19188-0031 IT IS YOUR DUTY RATHER RETORTED THE MAN YOU HAVE TWO SISTERS WHOM YOU MAINTAIN AND AN UNPRECEDENTED CONTROVERSY BROKE FORTH
4640-19188-0032 THIS IS THE REPUBLIC AND UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE REIGNS DO YOU YOURSELVES DESIGNATE THOSE WHO ARE TO GO THEY OBEYED AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF A FEW MINUTES FIVE WERE UNANIMOUSLY SELECTED
4640-19188-0033 AND STEPPED OUT OF THE RANKS THERE ARE FIVE OF THEM EXCLAIMED MARIUS THERE WERE ONLY FOUR UNIFORMS WELL BEGAN THE FIVE ONE MUST STAY BEHIND
4640-19188-0034 AND THEN A STRUGGLE AROSE AS TO WHO SHOULD REMAIN AND WHO SHOULD FIND REASONS FOR THE OTHERS NOT REMAINING THE GENEROUS QUARREL BEGAN AFRESH YOU HAVE A WIFE WHO LOVES YOU
4640-19188-0035 DO YOU DESIGNATE WHO IS TO REMAIN YES SAID THE FIVE CHOOSE WE WILL OBEY YOU MARIUS DID NOT BELIEVE THAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF ANOTHER EMOTION
4640-19188-0036 WHICH ONE BEHOLDS IN THE DEPTHS OF HISTORY HOVERING OVER THERMOPYLAE
4640-19188-0037 AND MARIUS STUPIDLY COUNTED THEM THERE WERE STILL FIVE OF THEM THEN HIS GLANCE DROPPED TO THE FOUR UNIFORMS AT THAT MOMENT A FIFTH UNIFORM FELL AS IF FROM HEAVEN UPON THE OTHER FOUR
4640-19188-0038 THE FIFTH MAN WAS SAVED
4640-19188-0039 THANKS TO HIS DRESS OF A NATIONAL GUARDSMAN HE HAD MADE HIS WAY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THE SENTINEL STATIONED BY THE INSURGENTS IN THE RUE MONDETOUR HAD NO OCCASION TO GIVE THE ALARM FOR A SINGLE NATIONAL GUARDSMAN
4640-19188-0040 AND HE HAD SILENTLY REMOVED HIS COAT AND FLUNG IT ON THE PILE WITH THE REST THE EMOTION AROUSED WAS INDESCRIBABLE
4640-19189-0000 THE PLENITUDE OF THE REVOLUTION HE WAS INCOMPLETE HOWEVER SO FAR AS THE ABSOLUTE CAN BE SO HE HAD TOO MUCH OF SAINT JUST ABOUT HIM AND NOT ENOUGH OF ANACHARSIS CLOOTS
4640-19189-0001 STILL HIS MIND IN THE SOCIETY OF THE FRIENDS OF THE A B C HAD ENDED BY UNDERGOING A CERTAIN POLARIZATION FROM COMBEFERRE'S IDEAS FOR SOME TIME PAST HE HAD BEEN GRADUALLY EMERGING FROM THE NARROW FORM OF DOGMA
4640-19189-0002 AND HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TO INCLINE TO THE BROADENING INFLUENCE OF PROGRESS AND HE HAD COME TO ACCEPT AS A DEFINITIVE AND MAGNIFICENT EVOLUTION
4640-19189-0003 A SORT OF STIFLED FIRE DARTED FROM HIS EYES WHICH WERE FILLED WITH AN INWARD LOOK ALL AT ONCE HE THREW BACK HIS HEAD HIS BLOND LOCKS FELL BACK LIKE THOSE OF AN ANGEL ON THE SOMBRE QUADRIGA MADE OF STARS
4640-19189-0004 THEY WERE LIKE THE MANE OF A STARTLED LION IN THE FLAMING OF AN HALO
4640-19189-0005 OLD MEN BLESSING CHILDREN THE PAST LOVING THE PRESENT THINKERS ENTIRELY AT LIBERTY BELIEVERS ON TERMS OF FULL EQUALITY FOR RELIGION HEAVEN GOD THE DIRECT PRIEST
4640-19189-0006 HUMAN CONSCIENCE BECOME AN ALTAR NO MORE HATREDS THE FRATERNITY OF THE WORKSHOP AND THE SCHOOL FOR SOLE PENALTY AND RECOMPENSE FAME WORK FOR ALL RIGHT FOR ALL
4640-19189-0007 PEACE OVER ALL NO MORE BLOODSHED NO MORE WARS HAPPY MOTHERS TO CONQUER MATTER IS THE FIRST STEP TO REALIZE THE IDEAL IS THE SECOND REFLECT ON WHAT PROGRESS HAS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED
4640-19189-0008 AND THE TALONS OF A TIGER FEARFUL BEASTS WHICH WERE ABOVE MAN MAN NEVERTHELESS SPREAD HIS SNARES CONSECRATED BY INTELLIGENCE AND FINALLY CONQUERED THESE MONSTERS
4640-19189-0009 ON THE DAY WHEN THIS PROMETHEAN TASK SHALL BE ACCOMPLISHED AND WHEN MAN SHALL HAVE DEFINITELY HARNESSED TO HIS WILL THE TRIPLE CHIMAERA OF ANTIQUITY THE HYDRA THE DRAGON AND THE GRIFFIN
4640-19189-0010 COURAGE AND ONWARD CITIZENS WHITHER ARE WE GOING TO SCIENCE MADE GOVERNMENT TO THE FORCE OF THINGS BECOME THE SOLE PUBLIC FORCE
4640-19189-0011 WE ARE ADVANCING TO THE UNITY OF MAN NO MORE FICTIONS NO MORE PARASITES THE REAL GOVERNED BY THE TRUE THAT IS THE GOAL CIVILIZATION WILL HOLD ITS ASSIZES AT THE SUMMIT OF EUROPE
4640-19189-0012 EUROPE WILL HAVE HER AMPHICTYONS THE GLOBE WILL HAVE ITS AMPHICTYONS FRANCE BEARS THIS SUBLIME FUTURE IN HER BREAST THIS IS THE GESTATION OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
4640-19189-0013 I REVERE YOU YES YOU CLEARLY BEHOLD THE FUTURE YES YOU ARE RIGHT YOU HAD NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER
4640-19189-0014 YOU ADOPTED HUMANITY FOR YOUR MOTHER AND RIGHT FOR YOUR FATHER YOU ARE ABOUT TO DIE THAT IS TO SAY TO TRIUMPH HERE CITIZENS WHATEVER HAPPENS TO DAY THROUGH OUR DEFEAT AS WELL AS THROUGH OUR VICTORY
4640-19189-0015 WHERE TWO OR THREE OF THESE SOVEREIGNTIES ARE COMBINED THE STATE BEGINS BUT IN THAT ASSOCIATION THERE IS NO ABDICATION EACH SOVEREIGNTY CONCEDES A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF ITSELF FOR THE PURPOSE OF FORMING THE COMMON RIGHT
4640-19189-0016 THIS QUANTITY IS THE SAME FOR ALL OF US THIS IDENTITY OF CONCESSION WHICH EACH MAKES TO ALL IS CALLED EQUALITY COMMON RIGHT IS NOTHING ELSE THAN THE PROTECTION OF ALL BEAMING ON THE RIGHT OF EACH
4640-19189-0017 THIS PROTECTION OF ALL OVER EACH IS CALLED FRATERNITY THE POINT OF INTERSECTION OF ALL THESE ASSEMBLED SOVEREIGNTIES IS CALLED SOCIETY THIS INTERSECTION BEING A JUNCTION THIS POINT IS A KNOT
4640-19189-0018 HENCE WHAT IS CALLED THE SOCIAL BOND SOME SAY SOCIAL CONTRACT WHICH IS THE SAME THING THE WORD CONTRACT
4640-19189-0019 A SOCIETY OF GREAT BLADES OF GRASS AND TINY OAKS A PROXIMITY OF JEALOUSIES WHICH RENDER EACH OTHER NULL AND VOID LEGALLY SPEAKING IT IS ALL APTITUDES POSSESSED OF THE SAME OPPORTUNITY
4640-19189-0020 POLITICALLY IT IS ALL VOTES POSSESSED OF THE SAME WEIGHT RELIGIOUSLY IT IS ALL CONSCIENCES POSSESSED OF THE SAME RIGHT EQUALITY HAS AN ORGAN GRATUITOUS AND OBLIGATORY INSTRUCTION
4640-19189-0021 AN IDENTICAL SOCIETY WILL SPRING YES INSTRUCTION LIGHT LIGHT EVERYTHING COMES FROM LIGHT AND TO IT EVERYTHING RETURNS CITIZENS THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IS GREAT BUT THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WILL BE HAPPY
4640-19189-0022 THEN THERE WILL BE NOTHING MORE LIKE THE HISTORY OF OLD WE SHALL NO LONGER AS TO DAY HAVE TO FEAR A CONQUEST AN INVASION A USURPATION A RIVALRY OF NATIONS
4640-19189-0023 ARMS IN HAND AN INTERRUPTION OF CIVILIZATION DEPENDING ON A MARRIAGE OF KINGS ON A BIRTH IN HEREDITARY TYRANNIES A PARTITION OF PEOPLES BY A CONGRESS A DISMEMBERMENT BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE OF A DYNASTY
4640-19189-0024 FROM THE FAILURE OF WORK AND THE SCAFFOLD AND THE SWORD AND BATTLES AND THE RUFFIANISM OF CHANCE IN THE FOREST OF EVENTS ONE MIGHT ALMOST SAY THERE WILL BE NO MORE EVENTS WE SHALL BE HAPPY
4640-19189-0025 AS THE PLANET AROUND THE LIGHT FRIENDS THE PRESENT HOUR IN WHICH I AM ADDRESSING YOU IS A GLOOMY HOUR BUT THESE ARE TERRIBLE PURCHASES OF THE FUTURE A REVOLUTION IS A TOLL
4640-19189-0026 OH THE HUMAN RACE WILL BE DELIVERED RAISED UP CONSOLED WE AFFIRM IT ON THIS BARRIER WHENCE SHOULD PROCEED THAT CRY OF LOVE IF NOT FROM THE HEIGHTS OF SACRIFICE
4640-19189-0027 A HEAP OF IDEAS AND A HEAP OF WOES HERE MISERY MEETS THE IDEAL THE DAY EMBRACES THE NIGHT AND SAYS TO IT I AM ABOUT TO DIE AND THOU SHALT BE BORN AGAIN WITH ME
4640-19189-0028 FROM THE EMBRACE OF ALL DESOLATIONS FAITH LEAPS FORTH SUFFERINGS BRING HITHER THEIR AGONY AND IDEAS THEIR IMMORTALITY THIS AGONY AND THIS IMMORTALITY ARE ABOUT TO JOIN
4640-19189-0029 AND CONSTITUTE OUR DEATH BROTHERS HE WHO DIES HERE DIES IN THE RADIANCE OF THE FUTURE AND WE ARE ENTERING A TOMB ALL FLOODED WITH THE DAWN
4640-19189-0030 HIS LIPS CONTINUED TO MOVE SILENTLY AS THOUGH HE WERE TALKING TO HIMSELF WHICH CAUSED THEM ALL TO GAZE ATTENTIVELY AT HIM IN THE ENDEAVOR TO HEAR MORE THERE WAS NO APPLAUSE
4640-19189-0031 JAVERT LACONIC
4640-19189-0032 LET THE READER RECALL THE STATE OF HIS SOUL WE HAVE JUST RECALLED IT EVERYTHING WAS A VISION TO HIM NOW HIS JUDGMENT WAS DISTURBED
4640-19189-0033 MARIUS LET US INSIST ON THIS POINT WAS UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE GREAT DARK WINGS WHICH ARE SPREAD OVER THOSE IN THE DEATH AGONY HE FELT THAT HE HAD ENTERED THE TOMB
4640-19189-0034 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS ALREADY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL AND HE NO LONGER BEHELD THE FACES OF THE LIVING EXCEPT WITH THE EYES OF ONE DEAD
4640-19189-0035 WHAT HAD HE COME THERE TO DO MARIUS DID NOT ADDRESS ALL THESE QUESTIONS TO HIMSELF BESIDES SINCE OUR DESPAIR HAS THIS PECULIARITY THAT IT ENVELOPS OTHERS AS WELL AS OURSELVES
4640-19189-0036 AND HAD NOT EVEN THE AIR OF HEARING HIM WHEN MARIUS RAISED HIS VOICE TO SAY I KNOW HIM
4640-19189-0037 AND IF SUCH A WORD CAN BE USED FOR SUCH IMPRESSIONS WE SHOULD SAY THAT IT PLEASED HIM HE HAD ALWAYS FELT THE ABSOLUTE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ADDRESSING THAT ENIGMATICAL MAN WHO WAS IN HIS EYES
4640-19189-0038 BOTH EQUIVOCAL AND IMPOSING MOREOVER IT HAD BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE HE HAD SEEN HIM
4640-19189-0039 THE FIVE CHOSEN MEN LEFT THE BARRICADE BY WAY OF MONDETOUR LANE
4640-19189-0040 ONE OF THEM WEPT AS HE TOOK HIS LEAVE BEFORE SETTING OUT THEY EMBRACED THOSE WHO REMAINED WHEN THE FIVE MEN SENT BACK TO LIFE HAD TAKEN THEIR DEPARTURE
4640-19189-0041 HE ENTERED THE TAP ROOM
4640-19189-0042 JAVERT REPLIED WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO KILL ME WAIT WE NEED ALL OUR CARTRIDGES JUST AT PRESENT THEN GIVE ME A DRINK SAID JAVERT
4640-19189-0043 THEY ADDED TO THE SYSTEM OF LIGATURES WHICH RENDERED EVERY ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE IMPOSSIBLE THAT SORT OF BOND WHICH IS CALLED IN PRISONS A MARTINGALE WHICH STARTING AT THE NECK
4640-19189-0044 FORKS ON THE STOMACH AND MEETS THE HANDS AFTER PASSING BETWEEN THE LEGS WHILE THEY WERE BINDING JAVERT A MAN STANDING ON THE THRESHOLD WAS SURVEYING HIM WITH SINGULAR ATTENTION
4788-294466-0000 MARY'S NETTLESOME BROWN PONY WAS HARD TO QUIET UNTIL JERRY REACHED OUT A STRONG BROWN HAND AND PATTED ITS HEAD MARY LIFTED STARTLED BLUE EYES JERRY WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT SHE ASKED
4788-294466-0001 WE COULDN'T HAVE IMAGINED THAT GUN SHOT AND SURELY THE HORSES HEARD IT ALSO JERRY'S SMILE WAS REASSURING TWAS THE STORY THAT FRIGHTENED YOU GIRLS I RECKON HE SAID GLANCING ABOUT AND UP AND DOWN THE ROAD AS HE SPOKE
4788-294466-0002 HE MUST HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR YEARS IF HE WAS OLD WHEN JERRY'S FATHER WAS A BOY OF COURSE DORA LESS INCLINED TO BE IMAGINATIVE REPLIED THEN TO THE COWBOY SHE SAID IN HER PRACTICAL MATTER OF FACT WAY
4788-294466-0003 HURRY ALONG HOME TO YOUR MILKING JERRY AND DICK DON'T YOU BOTHER TO COME WITH US NOW THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON THE NEWCOMB RANCH YOU OUGHT TO BE THERE IT'S ONLY A FEW MILES UP OVER THIS SUNSHINY ROAD TO GLEESON WE AREN'T THE LEAST BIT AFRAID TO RIDE HOME ALONE ARE WE
4788-294466-0004 SHE SMILED AT HER FRIEND MARY NOT WISHING TO APPEAR FOOLISHLY TIMID SAID IN AS COURAGEOUS A VOICE AS SHE COULD MUSTER OF COURSE WE'RE NOT AFRAID GOODBYE BOYS WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW
4788-294466-0005 FEELING ASSURED THAT THE GIRLS WERE ALL RIGHT THE BOYS WENT AT A GALLOP DOWN THE ROAD AND ACROSS THE DESERT VALLEY TO THE NEWCOMB RANCH
4788-294466-0006 THEY'RE NICE BOYS AREN'T THEY MARY SAID I'VE ALWAYS WISHED I HAD A BROTHER AND I DO BELIEVE JERRY IS GOING TO BE JUST LIKE ONE ALOUD DORA REPLIED I HAVE NOTICED THAT SOMETIMES HE CALLS YOU LITTLE SISTER TO HERSELF SHE THOUGHT
4788-294466-0007 OH MARY HOW BLIND YOU ARE DREAMILY THE YOUNGER GIRL WAS SAYING THAT'S BECAUSE WE WERE PLAYMATES WHEN WE WERE LITTLE SO VERY LONG AGO OH MY HOW ANCIENT WE ARE DORA SAID TEASINGLY
4788-294466-0008 PLEASE REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE ONLY ONE YEAR YOUNGER THAN I AM AND I REFUSE TO BE CALLED ELDERLY MARY SMILED FAINTLY BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SHE WAS STILL THINKING OF THE PAST WHEN SHE HAD BEEN A LITTLE GIRL WITH GOLDEN CURLS THAT HUNG TO HER WAIST A WONDERFULLY PRETTY WISTFUL LITTLE GIRL
4788-294466-0009 WHEN SHE SPOKE SHE SAID IT'S ONLY NATURAL THAT JERRY SHOULD CALL ME LITTLE SISTER OUR MOTHERS WERE LIKE SISTERS WHEN THEY WERE GIRL BRIDES I'VE TOLD YOU HOW THEY BOTH CAME FROM THE EAST JUST AS WE HAVE MY MOTHER MET DAD IN BISBEE WHERE HE WAS A MINING ENGINEER
4788-294466-0010 AND JERRY'S MOTHER TAUGHT A LITTLE DESERT SCHOOL OVER NEAR THE NEWCOMB RANCH SHE DIDN'T TEACH LONG THOUGH FOR THAT VERY FIRST VACATION SHE MARRIED JERRY'S COWBOY FATHER AFTER THAT MOTHER AND MISSUS NEWCOMB WERE GOOD FRIENDS NATURALLY BEING BRIDES AND NEIGHBORS
4788-294466-0011 WHEN JERRY AND I WERE LITTLE WE WERE PLAYMATES I SPENT DAYS AT THE RANCH SOMETIMES HER SWEET FACE WAS VERY SAD AS SHE ENDED WITH UNTIL MOTHER DIED WHEN I WAS EIGHT THEN YOU CAME EAST TO BOARDING SCHOOL AND BECAME LIKE A SISTER TO ME
4788-294466-0012 FAR BELOW THEM THE DESERT VALLEY STRETCHED MANY MILES SOUTHWARD TO THE MEXICAN BORDER THE GIRLS COULD SEE A DISTANT BLUE HAZE THAT WAS THE SMOKE FROM THE DOUGLAS COPPER SMELTERS THE LATE AFTERNOON SUN LAY IN FLOODS OF SILVER LIGHT ON THE SANDY ROAD AHEAD OF THEM
4788-294466-0013 IT WAS VERY STILL NOT A SOUND WAS TO BE HEARD NOW AND THEN A RABBIT DARTED PAST SILENTLY HOW PEACEFUL THIS HOUR IS ON THE DESERT MARY BEGAN GLANCING AT HER FRIEND WHO WAS RIDING SO CLOSE AT HER SIDE
4788-294466-0014 NOTICING THAT DORA WAS DEEP IN THOUGHT SHE ASKED LIGHTLY WON'T YOU SAY IT OUT LOUD WHY OF COURSE I WAS JUST WONDERING WHY JERRY HURRIED US AWAY SO FAST FROM LUCKY LOON'S ROCK HOUSE BECAUSE HE HAD TO DO THE MILKING MARY REPLIED SIMPLY
4788-294466-0015 DORA NODDED SO HE SAID THEN SHE HASTENED TO ADD OH DON'T THINK I'M INFERRING THAT JERRY TOLD AN UNTRUTH BUT YOU KNOW THAT SOME EVENINGS HE HAS STAYED WITH US FOR SUPPER AND MARY GLANCED UP STARTLED DORA BELLMAN SHE SAID
4788-294466-0016 I DON'T BELIEVE HE WILL TELL US ABOUT THAT I ACTED SO LIKE A SCARE CAT ALL THE TIME WE WERE THERE HE WON'T EVER TAKE US THERE AGAIN AND HE PROBABLY WON'T TELL US THE STORY EITHER THEN I'LL FIND IT OUT SOME OTHER WAY DORA DECLARED
4788-294466-0017 I'M CRAZY ABOUT MYSTERIES AS YOU KNOW AND IF THERE REALLY IS ONE ABOUT THAT ROCK HOUSE I WANT TO TRY TO SOLVE IT SHE SAID NO MORE ABOUT IT JUST THEN AS THEY HAD REACHED THE OLD GHOST TOWN OF GLEESON
4788-294466-0018 IN THE LONG AGO DAYS WHEN THE TOWN HAD BEEN TEEMING WITH LIFE PICTURESQUE LOOKING MINERS AND RANCHERS HAD SAT THERE TILTED BACK SMOKING PIPES AND SWAPPING YARNS TODAY THE CHAIRS WERE EMPTY AN OLD MAN SHRIVELED
4788-294466-0019 GRAY BEARDED UNKEMPT BUT WITH KIND GRAY EYES DEEP SUNKEN UNDER SHAGGY BROWS STOOD IN THE OPEN DOOR HE SMILED OUT AT THEM IN A FRIENDLY WAY THEN BECKONED WITH A BONY FINGER
4788-294466-0020 I DO BELIEVE MISTER HARVEY HAS A LETTER FOR US DORA SAID THE OLD MAN HAD SHUFFLED INTO THE DARK WELL OF HIS STORE A MOMENT LATER HE REAPPEARED WITH SEVERAL LETTERS AND A NEWSPAPER GOOD
4788-294466-0021 DORA EXCLAIMED AS SHE RODE CLOSE TO THE PORCH THANKS A LOT SHE CALLED BRIGHTLY UP TO THE OLD MAN WHO WAS HANDING THE PACKET DOWN OVER THE SAGGING WOODEN RAIL HIS FRIENDLY TOOTHLESS SMILE WAS DIRECTED AT THE SMALLER GIRL
4788-294466-0022 HE SAID MIS FARLEY YER NURSE WOMAN CAME DOWN TER MAIL SOME LETTERS A SPELL BACK THEN BEFORE MARY COULD REPLY HE CONTINUED IN HIS SHRILL WAVERING VOICE
4788-294466-0023 PALE FELLAR WI SPECS ON IS HER SON AIN'T HE YES MISTER HARVEY DICK IS MISSUS FARLEY'S SON MARY TOOK TIME IN A FRIENDLY WAY TO SATISFY THE OLD MAN'S CURIOSITY
4788-294466-0024 DICK HAS BEEN GOING TO THE ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY THIS WINTER TO BE NEAR HIS MOTHER SHE'S A WIDOW AND HE'S HER ONLY SON HER HUSBAND WAS A DOCTOR AND THEY LIVED BACK IN BOSTON BEFORE HE DIED DEW TELL THE OLD MAN WAGGED HIS HEAD SYMPATHETICALLY
4788-294466-0025 BUSTIN BRONCS MARY SMILED IN APPRECIATION OF THE OLD MAN'S JOKE NO JERRY WON'T EXPECT DICK TO DO THAT RIGHT AT FIRST HE'S OFFICIAL FENCE MENDER JUST AT PRESENT DORA DEFENDED THE ABSENT BOY MISTER HARVEY
4788-294466-0026 YOU WAIT UNTIL DICK HAS BEEN ON THE DESERT LONG ENOUGH TO GET A COAT OF TAN HE MAY SURPRISE YOU
4788-294466-0027 SOME WITH BROKEN WINDOWS AND DOORS OTHERS WITH SAGGING ROOFS AND CRUMBLING WALLS THE ONLY SIGN OF LIFE WAS IN THREE SMALL ADOBES WHERE POOR MEXICAN FAMILIES LIVED BROKEN WINDOWS IN TWO OF THE HOUSES WERE STUFFED WITH RAGS
4788-294466-0028 A BRIGHT BLACK EYED MEXICAN BOY OF ABOUT TEN RAN OUT TO THE ROAD AS THE GIRLS APPROACHED COME ON EMANUEL MARY SANG DOWN TO HIM YOU MAY PUT UP OUR HORSES AND EARN A DIME THE SMALL BOY'S WHITE TEETH FLASHED IN A DELIGHTED GRIN
4788-294466-0029 HIS BROWN FEET RACED SO FAST THAT BY THE TIME THE GIRLS WERE DISMOUNTING BEFORE THE BIG SQUARE TWO STORIED ADOBE NEAR THE MOUNTAINS EMANUEL WAS THERE TO LEAD THEIR HORSES AROUND BACK MARY GLANCED AFFECTIONATELY AT THE OLD PLACE WITH ITS FLOWER EDGED WALK
4788-294466-0030 ITS BROAD PORCH AND ADOBE PILLARS HERE HER MOTHER HAD COME AS A BRIDE HERE MARY HAD BEEN BORN EIGHT HAPPY YEARS THEY HAD SPENT TOGETHER BEFORE HER MOTHER DIED AFTER MARY HAD BEEN TAKEN EAST TO SCHOOL HER FATHER HAD RETURNED
4788-294466-0031 THEN GLANCING UP AT THE NURSE WHO HAD APPEARED FROM HER FATHER'S BEDROOM SHE ASKED EAGERLY MAY I TELL DAD AN ADVENTURE WE'VE HAD MISSUS FARLEY MIDDLE AGED KIND FACED SHOOK HER HEAD SMILING DOWN AT THE GIRL NOT TONIGHT PLEASE WON'T TOMORROW DO
4788-91208-0000 IT LOOKS BIG AND IMPORTANT AND IT MAKES A GREAT NOISE EVEN PEOPLE A LONG WAY UP IN THE SCALE OF CIVILIZATION ARE IN THE HABIT OF TAKING THESE ATTRIBUTES PERHAPS NOT AS THE ESSENTIAL ONES OF LEADERSHIP BUT AT ALL EVENTS AS THOSE BY WHICH A LEADER MAY BE RECOGNIZED
4788-91208-0001 THE POINTSMAN MOVES A HANDLE AND THE FOAMING GIANT THAT WOULD IT MAY BE HAVE SPED ON TO HIS DESTRUCTION AND THAT OF THE PASSIVE CREW WHO FOLLOW IN HIS REAR IS SHUNTED TO ANOTHER LINE RUNNING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND TO A MORE DESIRABLE GOAL
4788-91208-0002 THE GREAT INTELLECTUAL POINTSMAN OF OUR AGE THE MAN WHO HAS DONE MORE THAN ANY OTHER OF THIS GENERATION TO GIVE DIRECTION TO THE THOUGHT OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES HAS PASSED AWAY AND WE ARE LEFT TO MEASURE THE LOSS TO HUMANITY BY THE RESULT OF HIS LABORS
4788-91208-0003 MISTER MILL'S ACHIEVEMENTS IN BOTH BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY ARE SUCH AS TO GIVE HIM THE FOREMOST PLACE IN EITHER WHETHER WE REGARD HIM AS AN EXPOUNDER OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF MIND OR THE PHILOSOPHY OF SOCIETY HE IS
4788-91208-0004 THE STRUCTURE RAISED BY ADAM SMITH MALTHUS AND RICARDO BUT RAISED IT AT LEAST ONE STORY HIGHER HIS INESTIMABLE SYSTEM OF LOGIC WAS A REVOLUTION IT HARDLY NEEDS OF COURSE TO BE SAID THAT HE OWED MUCH TO HIS PREDECESSORS
4788-91208-0005 THAT HE BORROWED FROM WHEWELL MUCH OF HIS CLASSIFICATION FROM BROWN THE CHIEF LINES OF HIS THEORY OF CAUSATION FROM SIR JOHN HERSCHEL THE MAIN PRINCIPLES OF THE INDUCTIVE METHODS THOSE WHO THINK THIS A DISPARAGEMENT OF HIS WORK MUST HAVE VERY LITTLE CONCEPTION
4788-91208-0006 OF THE MASS OF ORIGINAL THOUGHT THAT STILL REMAINS TO MISTER MILL'S CREDIT THE GREAT CRITICAL POWER THAT COULD GATHER VALUABLE TRUTHS FROM SO MANY DISCORDANT SOURCES AND THE WONDERFUL SYNTHETIC ABILITY REQUIRED TO WELD THESE AND HIS OWN CONTRIBUTIONS
4788-91208-0007 INTO ONE ORGANIC WHOLE WHEN MISTER MILL COMMENCED HIS LABORS THE ONLY LOGIC RECOGNIZED WAS THE SYLLOGISTIC
4788-91208-0008 IN DEDUCING FROM GENERAL PROPOSITIONS OTHER PROPOSITIONS LESS GENERAL IT WAS EVEN ASSERTED CONFIDENTLY THAT NOTHING MORE WAS TO BE EXPECTED THAT AN INDUCTIVE LOGIC WAS IMPOSSIBLE THIS CONCEPTION OF LOGICAL SCIENCE NECESSITATED
4788-91208-0009 SOME GENERAL PROPOSITIONS TO START WITH AND THESE GENERAL PROPOSITIONS BEING EX
4788-91208-0010 INCAPABLE OF BEING PROVED FROM OTHER PROPOSITIONS IT FOLLOWED THAT IF THEY WERE KNOWN TO US AT ALL THEY MUST BE ORIGINAL DATA OF CONSCIOUSNESS HERE WAS A PERFECT PARADISE OF QUESTION BEGGING THE ULTIMATE MAJOR PREMISE IN EVERY ARGUMENT BEING ASSUMED
4788-91208-0011 IT COULD OF COURSE BE FASHIONED ACCORDING TO THE PARTICULAR CONCLUSION IT WAS CALLED IN TO PROVE THUS AN ARTIFICIAL IGNORANCE AS LOCKE CALLS IT WAS PRODUCED WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF SANCTIFYING PREJUDICE BY RECOGNIZING SO CALLED NECESSITIES OF THOUGHT
4788-91208-0012 AS THE ONLY BASES OF REASONING IT IS TRUE THAT OUTSIDE OF THE LOGIC OF THE SCHOOLS GREAT ADVANCES HAD BEEN MADE IN THE RULES OF SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION BUT THESE RULES WERE NOT ONLY IMPERFECT IN THEMSELVES BUT THEIR CONNECTION WITH THE LAW OF CAUSATION
4788-91208-0013 WAS BUT IMPERFECTLY REALIZED AND THEIR TRUE RELATION TO SYLLOGISM HARDLY DREAMT OF MISTER MILL ALTERED ALL THIS HE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE GENERAL TYPE OF REASONING IS NEITHER FROM GENERALS TO PARTICULARS NOR FROM PARTICULARS TO GENERALS BUT FROM PARTICULARS TO PARTICULARS
4788-91208-0014 BUT ARE NOW DEAD WE ARE ENTITLED TO CONCLUDE THAT ALL HUMAN BEINGS ARE MORTAL WE MIGHT SURELY WITHOUT ANY LOGICAL INCONSEQUENCE HAVE CONCLUDED AT ONCE FROM THOSE INSTANCES THAT THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON IS MORTAL
4788-91208-0015 THE MORTALITY OF JOHN THOMAS AND OTHERS IS AFTER ALL THE WHOLE EVIDENCE WE HAVE FOR THE MORTALITY OF THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON NOT ONE IOTA IS ADDED TO THE PROOF BY INTERPOLATING A GENERAL PROPOSITION
4788-91208-0016 WE NOT ONLY MAY ACCORDING TO MISTER MILL REASON FROM SOME PARTICULAR INSTANCES TO OTHERS BUT WE FREQUENTLY DO SO AS HOWEVER THE INSTANCES WHICH ARE SUFFICIENT TO PROVE ONE FRESH INSTANCE
4788-91208-0017 THE WORK OF DEDUCTION IS THE INTERPRETATION OF THESE FORMULAS AND THEREFORE STRICTLY SPEAKING IS NOT INFERENTIAL AT ALL THE REAL INFERENCE WAS ACCOMPLISHED WHEN THE UNIVERSAL PROPOSITION WAS ARRIVED AT
4788-91208-0018 ALL REASONING IS SHOWN TO BE AT BOTTOM INDUCTIVE INDUCTIONS AND THEIR INTERPRETATION MAKE UP THE WHOLE OF LOGIC AND TO INDUCTION ACCORDINGLY MISTER MILL DEVOTED HIS CHIEF ATTENTION FOR THE FIRST TIME INDUCTION WAS TREATED AS THE OPUS MAGNUM OF LOGIC
4788-91208-0019 AND THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE TRACED TO THEIR INDUCTIVE ORIGIN IT WAS THIS TAKEN WITH HIS THEORY OF THE SYLLOGISM WHICH WORKED THE GREAT CHANGE BOTH HIS SYSTEM OF LOGIC AND HIS EXAMINATION OF SIR WILLIAM HAMILTON'S PHILOSOPHY
4788-91208-0020 ARE FOR THE MOST PART DEVOTED TO FORTIFYING THIS POSITION AND DEMOLISHING BELIEFS INCONSISTENT WITH IT AS A SYSTEMATIC PSYCHOLOGIST MISTER MILL HAS NOT DONE SO MUCH AS EITHER PROFESSOR BAIN OR MISTER HERBERT SPENCER
4788-91208-0021 THE PERFECTION OF HIS METHOD ITS APPLICATION AND THE UPROOTING OF PREJUDICES WHICH STOOD IN ITS WAY THIS WAS THE TASK TO WHICH MISTER MILL APPLIED HIMSELF WITH AN ABILITY AND SUCCESS RARELY MATCHED AND NEVER SURPASSED
4788-91208-0022 THE BIGGEST LION IN THE PATH WAS THE DOCTRINE OF SO CALLED NECESSARY TRUTH THIS DOCTRINE WAS ESPECIALLY OBNOXIOUS TO HIM AS IT SET UP A PURELY SUBJECTIVE STANDARD OF TRUTH AND A STANDARD AS HE WAS EASILY ABLE TO SHOW
4788-91208-0023 VARYING ACCORDING TO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE INDIVIDUAL SUCH THINKERS AS DOCTOR WHEWELL AND MISTER HERBERT SPENCER HAD TO BE MET IN INTELLECTUAL COMBAT DOCTOR WHEWELL HELD NOT THAT THE INCONCEIVABILITY
4788-91208-0024 OF THE CONTRADICTORY OF A PROPOSITION IS A PROOF OF ITS TRUTH CO EQUAL WITH EXPERIENCE BUT THAT ITS VALUE TRANSCENDS EXPERIENCE EXPERIENCE MAY TELL US WHAT IS BUT IT IS BY THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF CONCEIVING IT OTHERWISE
4788-91208-0025 IN HIS EXAMINATION OF SIR WILLIAM HAMILTON'S PHILOSOPHY MISTER MILL GIVES BATTLE TO THIS MODE OF THOUGHT AFTER REVIEWING IN AN OPENING CHAPTER THE VARIOUS VIEWS WHICH HAVE BEEN HELD RESPECTING THE RELATIVITY OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE
4788-91208-0026 AS MISTER MILL SAYS THE NAME OF GOD IS VEILED UNDER TWO EXTREMELY ABSTRACT PHRASES INFINITE AND THE ABSOLUTE SO PROFOUND AND FRIENDLY A THINKER AS THE LATE MISTER GROTE HELD THIS RAISING OF THE VEIL INEXPEDIENT BUT HE PROVED
4788-91208-0027 BY A MISTAKE HE FELL INTO THE NECESSITY OF LOOKING AT THE MATTER IN THE CONCRETE HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE FORCE OF MISTER MILL'S ARGUMENT THAT THE INFINITE MUST INCLUDE A FARRAGO OF CONTRADICTIONS
4788-91208-0028 IN WHICH THESE CONTRADICTORY ATTRIBUTES INHERE BUT IT WAS AGAINST A CORRESPONDING BEING THE INFINITE THAT MISTER MILL WAS ARGUING IT IS THIS THAT HE CALLS A
4788-91208-0029 AND REGARDED AS THE REDUCTIO AD ABSURDISSIMUM OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL PHILOSOPHY MISTER MILL'S RELIGIOUS TENDENCIES MAY VERY WELL BE GATHERED FROM A PASSAGE IN HIS REVIEW OF AUGUSTE COMTE A PHILOSOPHER WITH WHOM HE AGREED ON ALL POINTS
4788-91208-0030 AND PRESCRIBE TO HIM A RULE OF LIFE THAT PERSON HAS A RELIGION AND THOUGH EVERY ONE NATURALLY PREFERS HIS OWN RELIGION TO ANY OTHER ALL MUST ADMIT THAT IF THE OBJECT OF HIS ATTACHMENT AND OF THIS FEELING OF DUTY IS THE AGGREGATE OF OUR FELLOW CREATURES
4788-91208-0031 THIS RELIGION OF THE INFIDEL CANNOT IN HONESTY AND CONSCIENCE BE CALLED AN INTRINSICALLY BAD ONE MANY INDEED MAY BE UNABLE TO BELIEVE THAT THIS OBJECT IS CAPABLE OF GATHERING ROUND IT FEELINGS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG
4788-91208-0032 AND WE JOIN WITH HIM IN CONTEMNING AS EQUALLY IRRATIONAL AND MEAN THE CONCEPTION OF HUMAN NATURE AS INCAPABLE OF GIVING ITS LOVE AND DEVOTING ITS EXISTENCE TO ANY OBJECT WHICH CANNOT AFFORD IN EXCHANGE AN ETERNITY OF PERSONAL ENJOYMENT
4788-91208-0033 NEVER HAS THE LIBEL OF HUMANITY INVOLVED IN THE CURRENT THEOLOGY BEEN MORE FORCIBLY POINTED OUT WITH ITS CONSTANT APPEAL TO LOW MOTIVES OF PERSONAL GAIN
4788-91208-0034 AND ALL HIS RELATIONS TO HIS FELLOW CREATURES THE VERY BIRDS ABOUT HIS DWELLING SEEMED TO RECOGNIZE IT IT IS THIS NOBLE SENTIMENT WHICH INFUSES A SOUL OF LIFE INTO HIS TEACHINGS AND THE ENUNCIATION AND ACTING OUT OF WHICH CONSTITUTE HIM
4788-94904-0000 WE HAVE RECOGNIZED IN REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT THE IDEAL TYPE OF THE MOST PERFECT POLITY FOR WHICH IN CONSEQUENCE ANY PORTION OF MANKIND ARE BETTER ADAPTED IN PROPORTION TO THEIR DEGREE OF GENERAL IMPROVEMENT AS THEY RANGE LOWER AND LOWER IN DEVELOPMENT
4788-94904-0001 THAT FORM OF GOVERNMENT WILL BE GENERALLY SPEAKING LESS SUITABLE TO THEM THOUGH THIS IS NOT TRUE UNIVERSALLY FOR THE ADAPTATION OF A PEOPLE TO REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DEPEND SO MUCH UPON THE PLACE THEY OCCUPY IN THE GENERAL SCALE OF HUMANITY
4788-94904-0002 AS UPON THE DEGREE IN WHICH THEY POSSESS CERTAIN SPECIAL REQUISITES REQUISITES HOWEVER SO CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THEIR DEGREE OF GENERAL ADVANCEMENT THAT ANY VARIATION BETWEEN THE TWO IS RATHER THE EXCEPTION THAN THE RULE
4788-94904-0003 THAT THEY SHOULD BE WILLING AND ABLE TO FULFILL THE DUTIES AND DISCHARGE THE FUNCTIONS WHICH IT IMPOSES ON THEM THE WILLINGNESS OF THE PEOPLE TO ACCEPT REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT ONLY BECOMES A PRACTICAL QUESTION WHEN AN ENLIGHTENED RULER OR A FOREIGN NATION OR NATIONS
4788-94904-0004 WHO HAVE GAINED POWER OVER THE COUNTRY ARE DISPOSED TO OFFER IT THE BOON TO INDIVIDUAL REFORMERS THE QUESTION IS ALMOST IRRELEVANT SINCE IF NO OTHER OBJECTION CAN BE MADE TO THEIR ENTERPRISE THAN THAT THE OPINION OF THE NATION IS NOT YET ON THEIR SIDE
4788-94904-0005 THEY HAVE THE READY AND PROPER ANSWER THAT TO BRING IT OVER TO THEIR SIDE IS THE VERY END THEY AIM AT WHEN OPINION IS REALLY ADVERSE ITS HOSTILITY IS USUALLY TO THE FACT OF CHANGE RATHER THAN TO REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IN ITSELF
4788-94904-0006 THE CONTRARY CASE IS NOT INDEED UNEXAMPLED THERE HAS SOMETIMES BEEN A RELIGIOUS REPUGNANCE TO ANY LIMITATION OF THE POWER OF A PARTICULAR LINE OF RULERS BUT IN GENERAL THE DOCTRINE OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE MEANT ONLY SUBMISSION TO THE WILL OF THE POWERS THAT BE
4788-94904-0007 WHETHER MONARCHICAL OR POPULAR IN ANY CASE IN WHICH THE ATTEMPT TO INTRODUCE REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IS AT ALL LIKELY TO BE MADE INDIFFERENCE TO IT
4788-94904-0008 RATHER THAN POSITIVE OPPOSITION ARE THE OBSTACLES TO BE EXPECTED THESE HOWEVER ARE AS FATAL AND MAY BE AS HARD TO BE GOT RID OF AS ACTUAL AVERSION IT BEING EASIER IN MOST CASES TO CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF AN ACTIVE FEELING THAN TO CREATE ONE
4788-94904-0009 IN A STATE PREVIOUSLY PASSIVE WHEN A PEOPLE HAVE NO SUFFICIENT VALUE FOR AND ATTACHMENT TO A REPRESENTATIVE CONSTITUTION THEY HAVE NEXT TO NO CHANCE OF RETAINING IT
4788-94904-0010 AND IS IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE PUBLIC TO IT PRINCIPALLY THE HOPES AND FEARS OF INDIVIDUALS ARE DIRECTED AND BY IT BOTH THE BENEFITS AND THE TERRORS AND PRESTIGE OF GOVERNMENT ARE MAINLY REPRESENTED TO THE PUBLIC EYE
4788-94904-0011 UNLESS THEREFORE THE AUTHORITIES WHOSE OFFICE IT IS TO CHECK THE EXECUTIVE ARE BACKED BY AN EFFECTIVE OPINION AND FEELING IN THE COUNTRY THE EXECUTIVE HAS ALWAYS THE MEANS OF SETTING THEM ASIDE OR COMPELLING THEM TO SUBSERVIENCE
4788-94904-0012 AND IS SURE TO BE WELL SUPPORTED IN DOING SO REPRESENTATIVE INSTITUTIONS NECESSARILY DEPEND FOR PERMANENCE UPON THE READINESS OF THE PEOPLE TO FIGHT FOR THEM IN CASE OF THEIR BEING ENDANGERED IF TOO LITTLE VALUED FOR THIS
4788-94904-0013 THEY SELDOM OBTAIN A FOOTING AT ALL AND IF THEY DO ARE ALMOST SURE TO BE OVERTHROWN AS SOON AS THE HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT OR ANY PARTY LEADER WHO CAN MUSTER FORCE FOR A COUP DE MAIN IS WILLING TO RUN SOME SMALL RISK FOR ABSOLUTE POWER
4788-94904-0014 THESE CONSIDERATIONS RELATE TO THE FIRST TWO CAUSES OF FAILURE IN A REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT THE THIRD IS WHEN THE PEOPLE WANT EITHER THE WILL OR THE CAPACITY TO FULFILL THE PART WHICH BELONGS TO THEM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CONSTITUTION
4788-94904-0015 WHEN NOBODY OR ONLY SOME SMALL FRACTION FEELS THE DEGREE OF INTEREST IN THE GENERAL AFFAIRS OF THE STATE NECESSARY TO THE FORMATION OF A PUBLIC OPINION THE ELECTORS WILL SELDOM MAKE ANY USE OF THE RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE BUT TO SERVE THEIR PRIVATE INTEREST OR THE INTEREST OF THEIR LOCALITY
4788-94904-0016 OR OF SOME ONE WITH WHOM THEY ARE CONNECTED AS ADHERENTS OR DEPENDENTS THE SMALL CLASS WHO IN THIS STATE OF PUBLIC FEELING GAIN THE COMMAND OF THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY FOR THE MOST PART USE IT SOLELY AS A MEANS OF SEEKING THEIR FORTUNE IF THE EXECUTIVE IS WEAK
4788-94904-0017 THE COUNTRY IS DISTRACTED BY MERE STRUGGLES FOR PLACE IF STRONG IT MAKES ITSELF DESPOTIC AT THE CHEAP PRICE OF APPEASING THE REPRESENTATIVES OR SUCH OF THEM AS ARE CAPABLE OF GIVING TROUBLE BY A SHARE OF THE SPOIL
4788-94904-0018 AND THE ONLY FRUIT PRODUCED BY NATIONAL REPRESENTATION IS THAT IN ADDITION TO THOSE WHO REALLY GOVERN THERE IS AN ASSEMBLY QUARTERED ON THE PUBLIC AND NO ABUSE IN WHICH A PORTION OF THE ASSEMBLY ARE INTERESTED IS AT ALL LIKELY TO BE REMOVED
4788-94904-0019 WHEN HOWEVER THE EVIL STOPS HERE THE PRICE MAY BE WORTH PAYING FOR THE PUBLICITY AND DISCUSSION WHICH THOUGH NOT AN INVARIABLE ARE A NATURAL ACCOMPANIMENT OF ANY EVEN NOMINAL REPRESENTATION
4788-94904-0020 THAT THE PLACE HUNTERS WHO CHIEFLY COMPOSE THE REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY THOUGH THEY CONTRIBUTE LITTLE OR NOTHING DIRECTLY TO GOOD GOVERNMENT NOR EVEN MUCH TEMPER THE ARBITRARY POWER OF THE EXECUTIVE
4788-94904-0021 WHICH EXISTS IN THAT COUNTRY THIS BENEFIT HOWEVER IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON THE COEXISTENCE WITH THE POPULAR BODY OF AN HEREDITARY KING IF INSTEAD OF STRUGGLING FOR THE FAVORS OF THE CHIEF RULER THESE SELFISH AND SORDID FACTIONS STRUGGLED FOR THE CHIEF PLACE ITSELF
4788-94904-0022 THEY WOULD CERTAINLY AS IN SPANISH AMERICA KEEP THE COUNTRY IN A STATE OF CHRONIC REVOLUTION AND CIVIL WAR A DESPOTISM NOT EVEN LEGAL BUT OF ILLEGAL VIOLENCE WOULD BE ALTERNATELY EXERCISED BY A SUCCESSION OF POLITICAL ADVENTURERS
4788-94904-0023 AND THE NAME AND FORMS OF REPRESENTATION WOULD HAVE NO EFFECT BUT TO PREVENT DESPOTISM FROM ATTAINING THE STABILITY AND SECURITY BY WHICH ALONE ITS EVILS CAN BE MITIGATED OR ITS FEW ADVANTAGES REALIZED
4788-94904-0024 THERE ARE OTHERS IN WHICH IT POSSIBLY MIGHT EXIST BUT IN WHICH SOME OTHER FORM OF GOVERNMENT WOULD BE PREFERABLE THESE ARE PRINCIPALLY WHEN THE PEOPLE IN ORDER TO ADVANCE IN CIVILIZATION HAVE SOME LESSON TO LEARN SOME HABIT NOT YET ACQUIRED
4788-94904-0025 TO THE ACQUISITION OF WHICH REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IS LIKELY TO BE AN IMPEDIMENT THE MOST OBVIOUS OF THESE CASES IS THE ONE ALREADY CONSIDERED IN WHICH THE PEOPLE HAVE STILL TO LEARN THE FIRST LESSON OF CIVILIZATION THAT OF OBEDIENCE
4788-94904-0026 A RACE WHO HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN ENERGY AND COURAGE BY STRUGGLES WITH NATURE AND THEIR NEIGHBORS BUT WHO HAVE NOT YET SETTLED DOWN INTO PERMANENT OBEDIENCE TO ANY COMMON SUPERIOR WOULD BE LITTLE LIKELY TO ACQUIRE THIS HABIT UNDER THE COLLECTIVE GOVERNMENT OF THEIR OWN BODY
4788-94904-0027 A REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY DRAWN FROM AMONG THEMSELVES WOULD SIMPLY REFLECT THEIR OWN TURBULENT INSUBORDINATION IT WOULD REFUSE ITS AUTHORITY TO ALL PROCEEDINGS WHICH WOULD IMPOSE ON THEIR SAVAGE INDEPENDENCE ANY IMPROVING RESTRAINT
4788-94904-0028 A MILITARY LEADER IS THE ONLY SUPERIOR TO WHOM THEY WILL SUBMIT EXCEPT OCCASIONALLY SOME PROPHET SUPPOSED TO BE INSPIRED FROM ABOVE OR CONJURER REGARDED AS POSSESSING MIRACULOUS POWER THESE MAY EXERCISE A TEMPORARY ASCENDANCY
4788-94904-0029 BUT AS IT IS MERELY PERSONAL IT RARELY EFFECTS ANY CHANGE IN THE GENERAL HABITS OF THE PEOPLE UNLESS THE PROPHET LIKE MOHAMMED IS ALSO A MILITARY CHIEF AND GOES FORTH THE ARMED APOSTLE OF A NEW RELIGION
4788-94904-0030 OR UNLESS THE MILITARY CHIEFS ALLY THEMSELVES WITH HIS INFLUENCE AND TURN IT INTO A PROP FOR THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT A PEOPLE ARE NO LESS UNFITTED FOR REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT BY THE CONTRARY FAULT TO THAT LAST SPECIFIED BY EXTREME PASSIVENESS
4788-94904-0031 AND READY SUBMISSION TO TYRANNY IF A PEOPLE THUS PROSTRATED BY CHARACTER AND CIRCUMSTANCES COULD OBTAIN REPRESENTATIVE INSTITUTIONS THEY WOULD INEVITABLY CHOOSE THEIR TYRANTS AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AND THE YOKE WOULD BE MADE HEAVIER ON THEM BY THE CONTRIVANCE WHICH
4788-94904-0032 MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO LIGHTEN IT ON THE CONTRARY MANY A PEOPLE HAS GRADUALLY EMERGED FROM THIS CONDITION BY THE AID OF A CENTRAL AUTHORITY WHOSE POSITION HAS MADE IT THE RIVAL AND HAS ENDED BY MAKING IT THE MASTER OF THE LOCAL DESPOTS
4788-94904-0033 EVEN WHEN THE KING WAS SCARCELY SO POWERFUL AS MANY OF HIS CHIEF FEUDATORIES THE GREAT ADVANTAGE WHICH HE DERIVED FROM BEING BUT ONE HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY FRENCH HISTORIANS TO HIM THE EYES OF ALL THE LOCALLY OPPRESSED WERE TURNED
4788-94904-0034 HE WAS THE OBJECT OF HOPE AND RELIANCE THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM WHILE EACH LOCAL POTENTATE WAS ONLY POWERFUL WITHIN A MORE OR LESS CONFINED SPACE AT HIS HANDS REFUGE AND PROTECTION WERE SOUGHT FROM EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY AGAINST FIRST ONE
4788-94904-0035 THEN ANOTHER OF THE IMMEDIATE OPPRESSORS HIS PROGRESS TO ASCENDANCY WAS SLOW BUT IT RESULTED FROM SUCCESSIVELY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OPPORTUNITIES WHICH OFFERED THEMSELVES ONLY TO HIM IT WAS THEREFORE SURE AND IN PROPORTION AS IT WAS ACCOMPLISHED
4788-94904-0036 IT ABATED IN THE OPPRESSED PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY THE HABIT OF SUBMITTING TO OPPRESSION THE KING'S INTEREST LAY IN ENCOURAGING ALL PARTIAL ATTEMPTS ON THE PART OF THE SERFS TO EMANCIPATE THEMSELVES FROM THEIR MASTERS AND PLACE THEMSELVES IN IMMEDIATE SUBORDINATION TO HIMSELF
4788-94904-0037 UNDER HIS PROTECTION NUMEROUS COMMUNITIES WERE FORMED WHICH KNEW NO ONE ABOVE THEM BUT THE KING
4788-94904-0038 AND THE MONARCH WAS LONG COMPELLED BY NECESSITIES OF POSITION TO EXERT HIS AUTHORITY AS THE ALLY RATHER THAN THE MASTER OF THE CLASSES WHOM HE HAD AIDED IN AFFECTING THEIR LIBERATION IN THIS MANNER A CENTRAL POWER DESPOTIC IN PRINCIPLE
4788-94904-0039 THOUGH GENERALLY MUCH RESTRICTED IN PRACTICE WAS MAINLY INSTRUMENTAL IN CARRYING THE PEOPLE THROUGH A NECESSARY STAGE OF IMPROVEMENT WHICH REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IF REAL WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE PREVENTED THEM FROM ENTERING UPON
481-123719-0000 IT WAS FOLLOWED BY REMORSE I TRIED TO DRIVE IT AWAY I FELT TOO SICK
481-123719-0001 I GREW USED TO EVERYTHING OR RATHER I VOLUNTARILY RESIGNED MYSELF TO ENDURING IT BUT I HAD A MEANS OF ESCAPE THAT RECONCILED EVERYTHING THAT WAS TO FIND REFUGE IN THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL IN DREAMS OF COURSE
481-123719-0002 I WAS A TERRIBLE DREAMER I WOULD DREAM FOR THREE MONTHS ON END TUCKED AWAY IN MY CORNER AND YOU MAY BELIEVE ME THAT AT THOSE MOMENTS I HAD NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IN THE PERTURBATION OF HIS CHICKEN HEART
481-123719-0003 PUT A COLLAR OF GERMAN BEAVER ON HIS GREAT COAT I SUDDENLY BECAME A HERO I WOULD NOT HAVE ADMITTED MY SIX FOOT LIEUTENANT EVEN IF HE HAD CALLED ON ME
481-123719-0004 BEFORE ME THEN WHAT WERE MY DREAMS
481-123719-0005 THOUGH INDEED EVEN NOW I AM TO SOME EXTENT SATISFIED WITH THEM DREAMS WERE PARTICULARLY SWEET AND VIVID AFTER A SPELL OF DISSIPATION
481-123719-0006 THERE WERE MOMENTS OF SUCH POSITIVE INTOXICATION OF SUCH HAPPINESS THAT THERE WAS NOT THE FAINTEST TRACE OF IRONY WITHIN ME ON MY HONOUR I HAD FAITH HOPE LOVE I BELIEVED BLINDLY AT SUCH TIMES THAT BY SOME MIRACLE
481-123719-0007 BY SOME EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCE ALL THIS WOULD SUDDENLY OPEN OUT EXPAND THAT SUDDENLY A VISTA OF SUITABLE ACTIVITY BENEFICENT GOOD AND ABOVE ALL READY MADE WHAT SORT OF ACTIVITY I HAD NO IDEA
481-123719-0008 BUT THE GREAT THING WAS THAT IT SHOULD BE ALL READY FOR ME WOULD RISE UP BEFORE ME AND I SHOULD COME OUT INTO THE LIGHT OF DAY ALMOST RIDING A WHITE HORSE AND CROWNED WITH LAUREL ANYTHING BUT THE FOREMOST PLACE I COULD NOT CONCEIVE FOR MYSELF
481-123719-0009 AND FOR THAT VERY REASON I QUITE CONTENTEDLY OCCUPIED THE LOWEST IN REALITY EITHER TO BE A HERO OR TO GROVEL IN THE MUD THERE WAS NOTHING BETWEEN
481-123719-0010 THAT WAS MY RUIN FOR WHEN I WAS IN THE MUD I COMFORTED MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT AT OTHER TIMES I WAS A HERO AND THE HERO WAS A CLOAK FOR THE MUD
481-123719-0011 IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THESE ATTACKS OF THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL VISITED ME EVEN DURING THE PERIOD OF DISSIPATION AND JUST AT THE TIMES WHEN I WAS TOUCHING THE BOTTOM THEY CAME IN SEPARATE SPURTS AS THOUGH REMINDING ME OF THEMSELVES
481-123719-0012 BUT DID NOT BANISH THE DISSIPATION BY THEIR APPEARANCE ON THE CONTRARY
481-123719-0013 AND WERE ONLY SUFFICIENTLY PRESENT TO SERVE AS AN APPETISING SAUCE THAT SAUCE WAS MADE UP OF CONTRADICTIONS AND SUFFERINGS OF AGONISING INWARD ANALYSIS AND ALL THESE PANGS AND PIN PRICKS GAVE A CERTAIN PIQUANCY
481-123719-0014 EVEN A SIGNIFICANCE TO MY DISSIPATION IN FACT COMPLETELY ANSWERED THE PURPOSE OF AN APPETISING SAUCE THERE WAS A CERTAIN DEPTH OF MEANING IN IT AND I COULD HARDLY HAVE RESIGNED MYSELF TO THE SIMPLE VULGAR DIRECT DEBAUCHERY OF A CLERK
481-123719-0015 AND HAVE ENDURED ALL THE FILTHINESS OF IT
481-123719-0016 INTO THE STREET NO I HAD A LOFTY WAY OF GETTING OUT OF IT ALL
481-123719-0017 IN THOSE FLIGHTS INTO THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL THOUGH IT WAS FANTASTIC LOVE THOUGH IT WAS NEVER APPLIED TO ANYTHING HUMAN IN REALITY YET THERE WAS SO MUCH OF THIS LOVE THAT ONE DID NOT FEEL AFTERWARDS EVEN THE IMPULSE TO APPLY IT IN REALITY
481-123719-0018 EVERYTHING HOWEVER PASSED SATISFACTORILY BY A LAZY AND FASCINATING TRANSITION INTO THE SPHERE OF ART THAT IS INTO THE BEAUTIFUL FORMS OF LIFE LYING READY
481-123719-0019 I CAME IN FOR COUNTLESS MILLIONS AND IMMEDIATELY DEVOTED THEM TO HUMANITY AND AT THE SAME TIME I CONFESSED BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE MY SHAMEFUL DEEDS WHICH OF COURSE WERE NOT MERELY SHAMEFUL BUT HAD IN THEM
481-123719-0020 MUCH THAT WAS SUBLIME AND BEAUTIFUL SOMETHING IN THE MANFRED STYLE EVERYONE WOULD KISS ME AND WEEP
481-123719-0021 AUSTERLITZ AGAINST THE OBSCURANTISTS THEN THE BAND WOULD PLAY A MARCH AN AMNESTY WOULD BE DECLARED THE POPE WOULD AGREE TO RETIRE FROM ROME TO BRAZIL
481-123719-0022 LAKE COMO BEING FOR THAT PURPOSE TRANSFERRED TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF ROME THEN WOULD COME A SCENE IN THE BUSHES AND SO ON AND SO ON AS THOUGH YOU DID NOT KNOW ALL ABOUT IT YOU WILL SAY THAT IT IS VULGAR AND CONTEMPTIBLE TO DRAG ALL THIS INTO PUBLIC
481-123719-0023 BUT WHY IS IT CONTEMPTIBLE CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT I AM ASHAMED OF IT ALL AND THAT IT WAS STUPIDER THAN ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE GENTLEMEN AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT SOME OF THESE FANCIES WERE BY NO MEANS BADLY COMPOSED
481-123719-0024 AND YET YOU ARE RIGHT IT REALLY IS VULGAR AND CONTEMPTIBLE
481-123719-0025 AND EVEN MORE CONTEMPTIBLE THAN THAT IS MY MAKING THIS REMARK NOW BUT THAT'S ENOUGH
481-123719-0026 I COULD NEVER STAND MORE THAN THREE MONTHS OF DREAMING AT A TIME WITHOUT FEELING AN IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE TO PLUNGE INTO SOCIETY TO PLUNGE INTO SOCIETY MEANT
481-123719-0027 TO VISIT MY SUPERIOR AT THE OFFICE ANTON ANTONITCH SYETOTCHKIN HE WAS THE ONLY PERMANENT ACQUAINTANCE I HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE
481-123719-0028 THAT IT BECAME ESSENTIAL AT ONCE TO EMBRACE MY FELLOWS AND ALL MANKIND AND FOR THAT PURPOSE I NEEDED AT LEAST ONE HUMAN BEING ACTUALLY EXISTING I HAD TO CALL ON ANTON ANTONITCH HOWEVER ON TUESDAY
481-123719-0029 HIS AT HOME DAY SO I HAD ALWAYS TO TIME MY PASSIONATE DESIRE TO EMBRACE HUMANITY SO THAT IT MIGHT FALL ON A TUESDAY THIS ANTON ANTONITCH LIVED ON THE FOURTH STOREY IN A HOUSE IN FIVE CORNERS IN FOUR LOW PITCHED ROOMS
481-123719-0030 ONE SMALLER THAN THE OTHER OF A PARTICULARLY FRUGAL AND SALLOW APPEARANCE HE HAD TWO DAUGHTERS AND THEIR AUNT WHO USED TO POUR OUT THE TEA OF THE DAUGHTERS ONE WAS THIRTEEN AND ANOTHER FOURTEEN
481-123719-0031 THEY BOTH HAD SNUB NOSES AND I WAS AWFULLY SHY OF THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE ALWAYS WHISPERING AND GIGGLING TOGETHER THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE USUALLY SAT IN HIS STUDY ON A LEATHER COUCH IN FRONT OF THE TABLE WITH SOME GREY HEADED GENTLEMAN
481-123719-0032 USUALLY A COLLEAGUE FROM OUR OFFICE OR SOME OTHER DEPARTMENT I NEVER SAW MORE THAN TWO OR THREE VISITORS THERE ALWAYS THE SAME THEY TALKED ABOUT THE EXCISE DUTY
481-123719-0033 AND THE BEST MEANS OF PLEASING HIM AND SO ON I HAD THE PATIENCE TO SIT LIKE A FOOL BESIDE THESE PEOPLE
481-123719-0034 LISTENING TO THEM WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT TO SAY TO THEM OR VENTURING TO SAY A WORD I BECAME STUPEFIED SEVERAL TIMES I FELT MYSELF PERSPIRING I WAS OVERCOME BY A SORT OF PARALYSIS BUT THIS WAS PLEASANT AND GOOD FOR ME
481-123719-0035 ON RETURNING HOME I DEFERRED FOR A TIME MY DESIRE TO EMBRACE ALL MANKIND I HAD HOWEVER ONE OTHER ACQUAINTANCE OF A SORT SIMONOV WHO WAS AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW I HAD A NUMBER OF SCHOOLFELLOWS INDEED IN PETERSBURG
481-123719-0036 BUT I DID NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THEM AND HAD EVEN GIVEN UP NODDING TO THEM IN THE STREET I BELIEVE I HAD TRANSFERRED INTO THE DEPARTMENT I WAS IN SIMPLY TO AVOID THEIR COMPANY AND TO CUT OFF ALL CONNECTION WITH MY HATEFUL CHILDHOOD
481-123719-0037 CURSES ON THAT SCHOOL AND ALL THOSE TERRIBLE YEARS OF PENAL SERVITUDE IN SHORT I PARTED FROM MY SCHOOLFELLOWS AS SOON AS I GOT OUT INTO THE WORLD THERE WERE TWO OR THREE LEFT TO WHOM I NODDED IN THE STREET ONE OF THEM WAS SIMONOV
481-123719-0038 WHO HAD IN NO WAY BEEN DISTINGUISHED AT SCHOOL WAS OF A QUIET AND EQUABLE DISPOSITION BUT I DISCOVERED IN HIM A CERTAIN INDEPENDENCE OF CHARACTER AND EVEN HONESTY I DON'T EVEN SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS PARTICULARLY STUPID
481-123719-0039 BUT THESE HAD NOT LASTED LONG AND HAD SOMEHOW BEEN SUDDENLY CLOUDED OVER HE WAS EVIDENTLY UNCOMFORTABLE AT THESE REMINISCENCES AND WAS I FANCY ALWAYS AFRAID THAT I MIGHT TAKE UP THE SAME TONE AGAIN
481-123719-0040 NOT BEING QUITE CERTAIN OF IT
481-123719-0041 BUT AS IT ALWAYS HAPPENED THAT SUCH REFLECTIONS IMPELLED ME AS THOUGH PURPOSELY TO PUT MYSELF INTO A FALSE POSITION I WENT IN
481-123720-0000 ALL OF THEM TOOK SCARCELY ANY NOTICE OF MY ENTRANCE WHICH WAS STRANGE FOR I HAD NOT MET THEM FOR YEARS EVIDENTLY THEY LOOKED UPON ME AS SOMETHING ON THE LEVEL OF A COMMON FLY I HAD NOT BEEN TREATED LIKE THAT EVEN AT SCHOOL THOUGH THEY ALL HATED ME
481-123720-0001 I KNEW OF COURSE THAT THEY MUST DESPISE ME NOW FOR MY LACK OF SUCCESS IN THE SERVICE AND FOR MY HAVING LET MYSELF SINK SO LOW GOING ABOUT BADLY DRESSED AND SO ON WHICH SEEMED TO THEM A SIGN OF MY INCAPACITY AND INSIGNIFICANCE
481-123720-0002 BUT I HAD NOT EXPECTED SUCH CONTEMPT SIMONOV WAS POSITIVELY SURPRISED AT MY TURNING UP
481-123720-0003 ALL THIS DISCONCERTED ME I SAT DOWN FEELING RATHER MISERABLE AND BEGAN LISTENING TO WHAT THEY WERE SAYING THEY WERE ENGAGED IN WARM AND EARNEST CONVERSATION ABOUT A FAREWELL DINNER WHICH THEY WANTED TO ARRANGE FOR THE NEXT DAY TO A COMRADE OF THEIRS CALLED ZVERKOV
481-123720-0004 THIS ZVERKOV HAD BEEN ALL THE TIME AT SCHOOL WITH ME TOO I HAD BEGUN TO HATE HIM PARTICULARLY IN THE UPPER FORMS IN THE LOWER FORMS HE HAD SIMPLY BEEN A PRETTY PLAYFUL BOY WHOM EVERYBODY LIKED I HAD HATED HIM HOWEVER EVEN IN THE LOWER FORMS
481-123720-0005 JUST BECAUSE HE WAS A PRETTY AND PLAYFUL BOY HE WAS ALWAYS BAD AT HIS LESSONS AND GOT WORSE AND WORSE AS HE WENT ON HOWEVER HE LEFT WITH A GOOD CERTIFICATE AS HE HAD POWERFUL INTERESTS DURING HIS LAST YEAR AT SCHOOL HE CAME IN FOR AN ESTATE OF TWO HUNDRED SERFS
481-123720-0006 AND AS ALMOST ALL OF US WERE POOR HE TOOK UP A SWAGGERING TONE AMONG US HE WAS VULGAR IN THE EXTREME BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS A GOOD NATURED FELLOW EVEN IN HIS SWAGGERING
481-123720-0007 IN SPITE OF SUPERFICIAL FANTASTIC AND SHAM NOTIONS OF HONOUR AND DIGNITY ALL BUT VERY FEW OF US POSITIVELY GROVELLED BEFORE ZVERKOV AND THE MORE SO THE MORE HE SWAGGERED AND IT WAS NOT FROM ANY INTERESTED MOTIVE
481-123720-0008 BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN FAVOURED BY THE GIFTS OF NATURE MOREOVER IT WAS AS IT WERE AN ACCEPTED IDEA AMONG US THAT ZVERKOV WAS A SPECIALIST IN REGARD TO TACT AND THE SOCIAL GRACES THIS LAST FACT PARTICULARLY INFURIATED ME
481-123720-0009 I HATED THE ABRUPT SELF CONFIDENT TONE OF HIS VOICE HIS ADMIRATION OF HIS OWN WITTICISMS
481-123720-0010 THOUGH HE WAS BOLD IN HIS LANGUAGE I HATED HIS HANDSOME BUT STUPID FACE FOR WHICH I WOULD HOWEVER HAVE GLADLY EXCHANGED MY INTELLIGENT ONE AND THE FREE AND EASY MILITARY MANNERS IN FASHION IN THE FORTIES
481-123720-0011 I HATED THE WAY IN WHICH HE USED TO TALK OF HIS FUTURE CONQUESTS OF WOMEN HE DID NOT VENTURE TO BEGIN HIS ATTACK UPON WOMEN UNTIL HE HAD THE EPAULETTES OF AN OFFICER AND WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THEM WITH IMPATIENCE AND BOASTED OF THE DUELS HE WOULD CONSTANTLY BE FIGHTING
481-123720-0012 I REMEMBER HOW I INVARIABLY SO TACITURN SUDDENLY FASTENED UPON ZVERKOV WHEN ONE DAY TALKING AT A LEISURE MOMENT WITH HIS SCHOOLFELLOWS OF HIS FUTURE RELATIONS WITH THE FAIR SEX AND GROWING AS SPORTIVE AS A PUPPY IN THE SUN
481-123720-0013 HE ALL AT ONCE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD NOT LEAVE A SINGLE VILLAGE GIRL ON HIS ESTATE UNNOTICED
481-123720-0014 AND THAT IF THE PEASANTS DARED TO PROTEST HE WOULD HAVE THEM ALL FLOGGED AND DOUBLE THE TAX ON THEM THE BEARDED RASCALS OUR SERVILE RABBLE APPLAUDED BUT I ATTACKED HIM NOT FROM COMPASSION FOR THE GIRLS AND THEIR FATHERS
481-123720-0015 BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE APPLAUDING SUCH AN INSECT I GOT THE BETTER OF HIM ON THAT OCCASION BUT THOUGH ZVERKOV WAS STUPID HE WAS LIVELY AND IMPUDENT AND SO LAUGHED IT OFF AND IN SUCH A WAY THAT MY VICTORY WAS NOT REALLY COMPLETE
481-123720-0016 THE LAUGH WAS ON HIS SIDE HE GOT THE BETTER OF ME ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AFTERWARDS BUT WITHOUT MALICE JESTINGLY CASUALLY I REMAINED ANGRILY AND CONTEMPTUOUSLY SILENT AND WOULD NOT ANSWER HIM WHEN WE LEFT SCHOOL HE MADE ADVANCES TO ME
481-123720-0017 I DID NOT REBUFF THEM FOR I WAS FLATTERED BUT WE SOON PARTED AND QUITE NATURALLY AFTERWARDS I HEARD OF HIS BARRACK ROOM SUCCESS AS A LIEUTENANT AND OF THE FAST LIFE HE WAS LEADING THEN THERE CAME OTHER RUMOURS
481-123720-0018 BY THEN HE HAD TAKEN TO CUTTING ME IN THE STREET AND I SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF COMPROMISING HIMSELF BY GREETING A PERSONAGE AS INSIGNIFICANT AS ME I SAW HIM ONCE IN THE THEATRE IN THE THIRD TIER OF BOXES
481-123720-0019 BY THEN HE WAS WEARING SHOULDER STRAPS HE WAS TWISTING AND TWIRLING ABOUT INGRATIATING HIMSELF WITH THE DAUGHTERS OF AN ANCIENT GENERAL IN THREE YEARS HE HAD GONE OFF CONSIDERABLY THOUGH HE WAS STILL RATHER HANDSOME AND ADROIT
481-123720-0020 ONE COULD SEE THAT BY THE TIME HE WAS THIRTY HE WOULD BE CORPULENT
481-123720-0021 THEY HAD KEPT UP WITH HIM FOR THOSE THREE YEARS THOUGH PRIVATELY THEY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES ON AN EQUAL FOOTING WITH HIM I AM CONVINCED OF THAT OF SIMONOV'S TWO VISITORS ONE WAS FERFITCHKIN A RUSSIANISED GERMAN
481-123720-0022 A LITTLE FELLOW WITH THE FACE OF A MONKEY A BLOCKHEAD WHO WAS ALWAYS DERIDING EVERYONE A VERY BITTER ENEMY OF MINE FROM OUR DAYS IN THE LOWER FORMS A VULGAR IMPUDENT SWAGGERING FELLOW WHO AFFECTED A MOST SENSITIVE FEELING
481-123720-0023 OF PERSONAL HONOUR THOUGH OF COURSE HE WAS A WRETCHED LITTLE COWARD AT HEART HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WORSHIPPERS OF ZVERKOV WHO MADE UP TO THE LATTER FROM INTERESTED MOTIVES AND OFTEN BORROWED MONEY FROM HIM SIMONOV'S OTHER VISITOR TRUDOLYUBOV WAS A PERSON IN NO WAY REMARKABLE
481-123720-0024 A TALL YOUNG FELLOW IN THE ARMY WITH A COLD FACE FAIRLY HONEST THOUGH HE WORSHIPPED SUCCESS OF EVERY SORT AND WAS ONLY CAPABLE OF THINKING OF PROMOTION HE WAS SOME SORT OF DISTANT RELATION OF ZVERKOV'S AND THIS
481-123720-0025 GAVE HIM A CERTAIN IMPORTANCE AMONG US HE ALWAYS THOUGHT ME OF NO CONSEQUENCE WHATEVER HIS BEHAVIOUR TO ME THOUGH NOT QUITE COURTEOUS WAS TOLERABLE WELL WITH SEVEN ROUBLES EACH SAID TRUDOLYUBOV TWENTY ONE ROUBLES BETWEEN THE THREE OF US
481-123720-0026 WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET A GOOD DINNER ZVERKOV OF COURSE WON'T PAY OF COURSE NOT SINCE WE ARE INVITING HIM SIMONOV DECIDED CAN YOU IMAGINE FERFITCHKIN INTERRUPTED HOTLY AND CONCEITEDLY
481-123720-0027 LIKE SOME INSOLENT FLUNKEY BOASTING OF HIS MASTER THE GENERAL'S DECORATIONS CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT ZVERKOV WILL LET US PAY ALONE HE WILL ACCEPT FROM DELICACY
481-123720-0028 SO THE THREE OF US WITH ZVERKOV FOR THE FOURTH
481-123720-0029 SIMONOV WHO HAD BEEN ASKED TO MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS CONCLUDED FINALLY HOW TWENTY ONE ROUBLES I ASKED IN SOME AGITATION WITH A SHOW OF BEING OFFENDED
481-123720-0030 TWENTY EIGHT ROUBLES IT SEEMED TO ME THAT TO INVITE MYSELF SO SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY WOULD BE POSITIVELY GRACEFUL AND THAT THEY WOULD ALL BE CONQUERED AT ONCE
481-123720-0031 DO YOU WANT TO JOIN TOO SIMONOV OBSERVED WITH NO APPEARANCE OF PLEASURE SEEMING TO AVOID LOOKING AT ME HE KNEW ME THROUGH AND THROUGH IT INFURIATED ME THAT HE KNEW ME SO THOROUGHLY WHY NOT
481-123720-0032 I AM AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW OF HIS TOO I BELIEVE AND I MUST OWN I FEEL HURT THAT YOU HAVE LEFT ME OUT I SAID BOILING OVER AGAIN AND WHERE WERE WE TO FIND YOU FERFITCHKIN PUT IN ROUGHLY YOU NEVER WERE ON GOOD TERMS WITH ZVERKOV TRUDOLYUBOV ADDED FROWNING
481-123720-0033 BUT I HAD ALREADY CLUTCHED AT THE IDEA AND WOULD NOT GIVE IT UP IT SEEMS TO ME THAT NO ONE HAS A RIGHT TO FORM AN OPINION UPON THAT I RETORTED IN A SHAKING VOICE AS THOUGH SOMETHING TREMENDOUS HAD HAPPENED PERHAPS THAT IS JUST MY REASON FOR WISHING IT NOW
481-123720-0034 THAT I HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN ON GOOD TERMS WITH HIM OH THERE'S NO MAKING YOU OUT WITH THESE REFINEMENTS TRUDOLYUBOV JEERED WE'LL PUT YOUR NAME DOWN SIMONOV DECIDED ADDRESSING ME
481-123720-0035 WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY FERFITCHKIN BEGAN IN AN UNDERTONE INDICATING ME TO SIMONOV BUT HE BROKE OFF FOR EVEN SIMONOV WAS EMBARRASSED THAT WILL DO SAID TRUDOLYUBOV GETTING UP IF HE WANTS TO COME SO MUCH LET HIM
481-123720-0036 BUT IT'S A PRIVATE THING BETWEEN US FRIENDS FERFITCHKIN SAID CROSSLY AS HE TOO PICKED UP HIS HAT IT'S NOT AN OFFICIAL GATHERING WE DO NOT WANT AT ALL PERHAPS THEY WENT AWAY FERFITCHKIN DID NOT GREET ME IN ANY WAY AS HE WENT OUT
481-123720-0037 TRUDOLYUBOV BARELY NODDED SIMONOV WITH WHOM I WAS LEFT TETE A TETE WAS IN A STATE OF VEXATION AND PERPLEXITY AND LOOKED AT ME QUEERLY
481-123720-0038 WILL YOU PAY YOUR SUBSCRIPTION NOW I JUST ASK SO AS TO KNOW HE MUTTERED IN EMBARRASSMENT I FLUSHED CRIMSON AS I DID SO I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD OWED SIMONOV FIFTEEN ROUBLES FOR AGES
481-123720-0039 WHICH I HAD INDEED NEVER FORGOTTEN THOUGH I HAD NOT PAID IT
481-123720-0040 VEXED THAT I HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT THAT DOESN'T MATTER YOU CAN PAY TOMORROW AFTER THE DINNER I SIMPLY WANTED TO KNOW PLEASE DON'T HE BROKE OFF AND BEGAN PACING THE ROOM STILL MORE VEXED AS HE WALKED HE BEGAN TO STAMP WITH HIS HEELS
481-123720-0041 AM I KEEPING YOU I ASKED AFTER TWO MINUTES OF SILENCE
481-123720-0042 THAT IS TO BE TRUTHFUL YES I HAVE TO GO AND SEE SOMEONE NOT FAR FROM HERE
481-123720-0043 MY GOODNESS WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO I CRIED
481-123720-0044 IT'S CLOSE BY NOT TWO PACES AWAY SIMONOV REPEATED ACCOMPANYING ME TO THE FRONT DOOR WITH A FUSSY AIR WHICH DID NOT SUIT HIM AT ALL
481-123720-0045 HE WAS VERY GLAD TO GET RID OF ME I WAS IN A FURY WHAT POSSESSED ME WHAT POSSESSED ME TO FORCE MYSELF UPON THEM I WONDERED GRINDING MY TEETH AS I STRODE ALONG THE STREET FOR A SCOUNDREL A PIG LIKE THAT ZVERKOV OF COURSE
481-123720-0046 I HAD BETTER NOT GO OF COURSE I MUST JUST SNAP MY FINGERS AT THEM
481-123720-0047 BUT WHAT MADE ME FURIOUS WAS THAT I KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT I SHOULD GO THAT I SHOULD MAKE A POINT OF GOING AND THE MORE TACTLESS THE MORE UNSEEMLY MY GOING WOULD BE THE MORE CERTAINLY I WOULD GO AND THERE WAS A POSITIVE OBSTACLE TO MY GOING
481-123720-0048 I HAD NO MONEY ALL I HAD WAS NINE ROUBLES I HAD TO GIVE SEVEN OF THAT TO MY SERVANT APOLLON FOR HIS MONTHLY WAGES THAT WAS ALL I PAID HIM HE HAD TO KEEP HIMSELF
481-123720-0049 NOT TO PAY HIM WAS IMPOSSIBLE CONSIDERING HIS CHARACTER BUT I WILL TALK ABOUT THAT FELLOW ABOUT THAT PLAGUE OF MINE ANOTHER TIME HOWEVER I KNEW I SHOULD GO AND SHOULD NOT PAY HIM HIS WAGES THAT NIGHT I HAD THE MOST HIDEOUS DREAMS
481-123720-0050 I WAS SENT TO THE SCHOOL BY DISTANT RELATIONS UPON WHOM I WAS DEPENDENT AND OF WHOM I HAVE HEARD NOTHING SINCE THEY SENT ME THERE A FORLORN SILENT BOY ALREADY CRUSHED BY THEIR REPROACHES ALREADY TROUBLED BY DOUBT
481-123720-0051 AND LOOKING WITH SAVAGE DISTRUST AT EVERYONE MY SCHOOLFELLOWS MET ME WITH SPITEFUL AND MERCILESS JIBES BECAUSE I WAS NOT LIKE ANY OF THEM BUT I COULD NOT ENDURE THEIR TAUNTS
481-123720-0052 I COULD NOT GIVE IN TO THEM WITH THE IGNOBLE READINESS WITH WHICH THEY GAVE IN TO ONE ANOTHER I HATED THEM FROM THE FIRST AND SHUT MYSELF AWAY FROM EVERYONE IN TIMID WOUNDED AND DISPROPORTIONATE PRIDE
481-123720-0053 THEIR COARSENESS REVOLTED ME THEY LAUGHED CYNICALLY AT MY FACE AT MY CLUMSY FIGURE AND YET WHAT STUPID FACES THEY HAD THEMSELVES IN OUR SCHOOL THE BOYS FACES SEEMED IN A SPECIAL WAY TO DEGENERATE AND GROW STUPIDER
481-123720-0054 HOW MANY FINE LOOKING BOYS CAME TO US IN A FEW YEARS THEY BECAME REPULSIVE EVEN AT SIXTEEN I WONDERED AT THEM MOROSELY EVEN THEN I WAS STRUCK BY THE PETTINESS OF THEIR THOUGHTS THE STUPIDITY OF THEIR PURSUITS
481-123720-0055 THEIR GAMES THEIR CONVERSATIONS THEY HAD NO UNDERSTANDING OF SUCH ESSENTIAL THINGS THEY TOOK NO INTEREST IN SUCH STRIKING IMPRESSIVE SUBJECTS THAT I COULD NOT HELP CONSIDERING THEM INFERIOR TO MYSELF
481-123720-0056 IT WAS NOT WOUNDED VANITY THAT DROVE ME TO IT AND FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT THRUST UPON ME YOUR HACKNEYED REMARKS REPEATED TO NAUSEA THAT I WAS ONLY A DREAMER WHILE THEY EVEN THEN HAD AN UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE
481-123720-0057 THEY TOOK RANK FOR INTELLIGENCE EVEN AT SIXTEEN THEY WERE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT A SNUG BERTH OF COURSE A GREAT DEAL OF IT WAS DUE TO THEIR STUPIDITY TO THE BAD EXAMPLES WITH WHICH THEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN SURROUNDED IN THEIR CHILDHOOD AND BOYHOOD
481-123720-0058 THEY WERE MONSTROUSLY DEPRAVED OF COURSE A GREAT DEAL OF THAT TOO WAS SUPERFICIAL AND AN ASSUMPTION OF CYNICISM OF COURSE THERE WERE GLIMPSES OF YOUTH AND FRESHNESS EVEN IN THEIR DEPRAVITY BUT EVEN THAT FRESHNESS WAS NOT ATTRACTIVE
481-123720-0059 AND SHOWED ITSELF IN A CERTAIN RAKISHNESS I HATED THEM HORRIBLY THOUGH PERHAPS I WAS WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM THEY REPAID ME IN THE SAME WAY AND DID NOT CONCEAL THEIR AVERSION FOR ME BUT BY THEN I DID NOT DESIRE THEIR AFFECTION
481-123720-0060 ON THE CONTRARY I CONTINUALLY LONGED FOR THEIR HUMILIATION TO ESCAPE FROM THEIR DERISION I PURPOSELY BEGAN TO MAKE ALL THE PROGRESS I COULD WITH MY STUDIES AND FORCED MY WAY TO THE VERY TOP THIS IMPRESSED THEM
481-123720-0061 MOREOVER THEY ALL BEGAN BY DEGREES TO GRASP THAT I HAD ALREADY READ BOOKS NONE OF THEM COULD READ AND UNDERSTOOD THINGS NOT FORMING PART OF OUR SCHOOL CURRICULUM OF WHICH THEY HAD NOT EVEN HEARD THEY TOOK A SAVAGE AND SARCASTIC VIEW OF IT
481-123720-0062 BUT WERE MORALLY IMPRESSED ESPECIALLY AS THE TEACHERS BEGAN TO NOTICE ME ON THOSE GROUNDS THE MOCKERY CEASED BUT THE HOSTILITY REMAINED AND COLD AND STRAINED RELATIONS BECAME PERMANENT BETWEEN US IN THE END I COULD NOT PUT UP WITH IT
481-123720-0063 WITH YEARS A CRAVING FOR SOCIETY FOR FRIENDS DEVELOPED IN ME I ATTEMPTED TO GET ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH SOME OF MY SCHOOLFELLOWS BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER MY INTIMACY WITH THEM WAS ALWAYS STRAINED AND SOON ENDED OF ITSELF
481-123720-0064 ONCE INDEED I DID HAVE A FRIEND
481-123720-0065 AND REPULSED HIM AS THOUGH ALL I NEEDED HIM FOR WAS TO WIN A VICTORY OVER HIM TO SUBJUGATE HIM AND NOTHING ELSE BUT I COULD NOT SUBJUGATE ALL OF THEM MY FRIEND WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE THEM EITHER HE WAS IN FACT A RARE EXCEPTION
481-123720-0066 THE FIRST THING I DID ON LEAVING SCHOOL WAS TO GIVE UP THE SPECIAL JOB FOR WHICH I HAD BEEN DESTINED SO AS TO BREAK ALL TIES
481-123720-0067 AND GOODNESS KNOWS WHY AFTER ALL THAT I SHOULD GO TRUDGING OFF TO SIMONOV'S EARLY NEXT MORNING I ROUSED MYSELF AND JUMPED OUT OF BED WITH EXCITEMENT AS THOUGH IT WERE ALL ABOUT TO HAPPEN AT ONCE
481-123720-0068 BUT I BELIEVED THAT SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WAS COMING AND WOULD INEVITABLY COME THAT DAY OWING TO ITS RARITY PERHAPS ANY EXTERNAL EVENT HOWEVER TRIVIAL ALWAYS MADE ME FEEL AS THOUGH SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WERE AT HAND
481-123720-0069 I WENT TO THE OFFICE HOWEVER AS USUAL BUT SNEAKED AWAY HOME TWO HOURS EARLIER TO GET READY THE GREAT THING I THOUGHT IS NOT TO BE THE FIRST TO ARRIVE OR THEY WILL THINK I AM OVERJOYED AT COMING BUT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF SUCH
481-123720-0070 AND THEY ALL AGITATED AND OVERWHELMED ME I POLISHED MY BOOTS A SECOND TIME WITH MY OWN HANDS NOTHING IN THE WORLD WOULD HAVE INDUCED APOLLON TO CLEAN THEM TWICE A DAY AS HE CONSIDERED THAT IT WAS MORE THAN HIS DUTIES REQUIRED OF HIM
481-123720-0071 I STOLE THE BRUSHES TO CLEAN THEM FROM THE PASSAGE BEING CAREFUL HE SHOULD NOT DETECT IT FOR FEAR OF HIS CONTEMPT
481-123720-0072 I HAD LET MYSELF GET TOO SLOVENLY MY UNIFORM PERHAPS WAS TIDY BUT I COULD NOT GO OUT TO DINNER IN MY UNIFORM THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT ON THE KNEE OF MY TROUSERS WAS A BIG YELLOW STAIN
481-123720-0073 I HAD A FOREBODING THAT THAT STAIN WOULD DEPRIVE ME OF NINE TENTHS OF MY PERSONAL DIGNITY I KNEW TOO THAT IT WAS VERY POOR TO THINK SO BUT THIS IS NO TIME FOR THINKING NOW I AM IN FOR THE REAL THING I THOUGHT AND MY HEART SANK
481-123720-0074 I KNEW TOO PERFECTLY WELL EVEN THEN THAT I WAS MONSTROUSLY EXAGGERATING THE FACTS BUT HOW COULD I HELP IT
481-123720-0075 WITH DESPAIR I PICTURED TO MYSELF HOW COLDLY AND DISDAINFULLY THAT SCOUNDREL ZVERKOV WOULD MEET ME
481-123720-0076 WITH WHAT IMPUDENT RUDENESS THE INSECT FERFITCHKIN WOULD SNIGGER AT ME IN ORDER TO CURRY FAVOUR WITH ZVERKOV HOW COMPLETELY SIMONOV WOULD TAKE IT ALL IN AND HOW HE WOULD DESPISE ME FOR THE ABJECTNESS OF MY VANITY AND LACK OF SPIRIT
481-123720-0077 AND WORST OF ALL HOW PALTRY UNLITERARY COMMONPLACE IT WOULD ALL BE
481-123720-0078 BUT THAT WAS MOST IMPOSSIBLE OF ALL IF I FEEL IMPELLED TO DO ANYTHING I SEEM TO BE PITCHFORKED INTO IT I SHOULD HAVE JEERED AT MYSELF EVER AFTERWARDS SO YOU FUNKED IT YOU FUNKED IT YOU FUNKED THE REAL THING
481-123720-0079 ON THE CONTRARY I PASSIONATELY LONGED TO SHOW ALL THAT RABBLE THAT I WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A SPIRITLESS CREATURE AS I SEEMED TO MYSELF WHAT IS MORE EVEN IN THE ACUTEST PAROXYSM OF THIS COWARDLY FEVER I DREAMED OF GETTING THE UPPER HAND
481-123720-0080 OF DOMINATING THEM CARRYING THEM AWAY MAKING THEM LIKE ME IF ONLY FOR MY ELEVATION OF THOUGHT AND UNMISTAKABLE WIT THEY WOULD ABANDON ZVERKOV HE WOULD SIT ON ONE SIDE SILENT AND ASHAMED WHILE I SHOULD CRUSH HIM THEN PERHAPS
481-123720-0081 WE WOULD BE RECONCILED AND DRINK TO OUR EVERLASTING FRIENDSHIP BUT WHAT WAS MOST BITTER AND HUMILIATING FOR ME WAS THAT I KNEW EVEN THEN KNEW FULLY AND FOR CERTAIN THAT I NEEDED NOTHING OF ALL THIS REALLY THAT I DID NOT REALLY WANT TO CRUSH
481-123720-0082 TO SUBDUE TO ATTRACT THEM
481-123720-0083 OH HOW I PRAYED FOR THE DAY TO PASS QUICKLY
481-123720-0084 OPENED THE MOVABLE PANE AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE TROUBLED DARKNESS OF THE THICKLY FALLING WET SNOW AT LAST MY WRETCHED LITTLE CLOCK HISSED OUT FIVE I SEIZED MY HAT AND TRYING NOT TO LOOK AT APOLLON
481-123720-0085 WHO HAD BEEN ALL DAY EXPECTING HIS MONTH'S WAGES BUT IN HIS FOOLISHNESS WAS UNWILLING TO BE THE FIRST TO SPEAK ABOUT IT I SLIPPED BETWEEN HIM AND THE DOOR AND JUMPING INTO A HIGH CLASS SLEDGE ON WHICH I SPENT MY LAST HALF ROUBLE
4813-248638-0000 A TOWN OF ENTERPRISE AND CHARACTER EVER SINCE THE FIRST WATER POWER MILL IN THIS COUNTRY THE FIRST POWDER MILL IN THIS COUNTRY THE FIRST CHOCOLATE MILL IN THIS COUNTRY AND THUS THROUGH A WHOLE LINE OF FIRST THINGS THE FIRST VIOLONCELLO
4813-248638-0001 FEW PEOPLE TO DAY THINK OF MILTON IN TERMS OF INDUSTRIAL REPUTE BUT RATHER AS A PLACE OF ESTATES TOO ARISTOCRATIC TO BE FASHIONABLE
4813-248638-0002 AND OF CHARMING WALKS AND DRIVES AND VIEWS MANY OF THE OLD FAMILIES WHO HAVE GIVEN THE TOWN ITS PRESTIGE STILL LIVE IN THEIR ANCESTRAL MANORS AND MANY OF THE FAMILIES WHO HAVE MOVED THERE IN RECENT YEARS
4813-248638-0003 AS THE STRANGER PASSES THROUGH MILTON HE IS CAPTIVATED BY GLIMPSES OF ANCIENT HOMESTEADS SETTLING BEHIND THEIR WHITE COLONIAL FENCES TOPPED WITH WHITE COLONIAL URNS HALF HIDDEN BY THEIR ANTIQUE TREES WITH AN AIR OF COMFORTABLE EASE
4813-248638-0004 OF BREEDING THAT NEITHER PARADES NOR CONCEALS ITS QUALITY YES THIS IS MILTON THIS IS MODERN MILTON BOSTON SOCIETY RECEIVES SOME OF ITS MOST PROMINENT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THIS PATRICIAN SOURCE
4813-248638-0005 BUT MODERN MILTON IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THIS AS OLD MILTON
4813-248638-0006 THAT SWIMS FOREVER AGAINST THE SKY THAT MARCHES FOREVER AROUND THE HORIZON THE ROUNDED SUMMITS OF THE BLUE HILLS TO WHICH THE EYE IS IRRESISTIBLY ATTRACTED BEFORE ENTERING THE TOWN WHICH PRINCIPALLY CLAIMS THEM ARE THE WORN DOWN STUMPS OF ANCIENT MOUNTAINS
4813-248638-0007 AND ALTHOUGH SO LEVELED BY THE PROCESS OF THE AGES THEY ARE STILL THE HIGHEST LAND NEAR THE COAST FROM MAINE TO MEXICO THESE EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY SKYEY CRESTS FORM THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE SO CALLED BOSTON BASIN
4813-248638-0008 AND ARE THE MOST PROMINENT FEATURE OF THE SOUTHERN COAST FROM THEM THE MASSACHUSET TRIBE ABOUT THE BAY DERIVED ITS NAME SIGNIFYING NEAR THE GREAT HILLS WHICH NAME WAS CHANGED BY THE ENGLISH TO MASSACHUSETTS
4813-248638-0009 AND APPLIED TO BOTH BAY AND COLONY ALTHOUGH ITS INDIAN NAME HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM THIS LOVELY RANGE THE LOVELINESS REMAINS ALL THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY SHIMMERS UNDER THE MYSTERIOUS BLOOM OF THESE HEIGHTS
4813-248638-0010 SO VAST THAT EVERYTHING ELSE IS DWARFED BESIDE THEM AND YET SO CURIOUSLY AIRY THAT THEY SEEM TO PERPETUALLY RIPPLE AGAINST THE SKY THE GREAT BLUE HILL ESPECIALLY THE ONE WHICH BEARS AN OBSERVATORY ON ITS SUMMIT SWIMS ABOVE ONE'S HEAD
4813-248638-0011 IT SEEMS TO HAVE A SINGULAR WAY OF MOVING FROM POINT TO POINT AS ONE MOTORS AND ALTHOUGH ONE MAY BE FORCED TO ADMIT THAT THIS MAY BE DUE MORE TO THE WINDING ROADS THAN TO THE ILLUSIVENESS OF THE HILL STILL THE BUOYANT EFFECT IS THE SAME
4813-248638-0012 RUSKIN DECLARES SOMEWHERE WITH HIS QUAINT AND CHARACTERISTIC MIXTURE OF POSITIVENESS AND IDEALISM THAT INHABITANTS OF GRANITE COUNTRIES
4813-248638-0013 THAT CLEARLY DISTINGUISHES THEM FROM THE INHABITANTS OF LESS PURE DISTRICTS PERHAPS HE WAS RIGHT FOR SURELY HERE
4813-248638-0014 EACH HAS THROUGH ITS OWN FAIR NAME DONE HONOR TO THE FAIR NAMES WHICH HAVE PRECEDED IT ONE OF THE VERY FIRST TO BE ATTRACTED BY THE LOFTY AND YET LOVELY APPEAL OF THIS REGION WAS GOVERNOR THOMAS HUTCHINSON
4813-248638-0015 AND THE WIDE FLAT TWIST OF THE NEPONSET RIVER WINDING THROUGH IT FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A DECORATIVE PANEL
4813-248638-0016 THIS IS THE VIEW THAT THE GOVERNOR SO ADMIRED AND TRADITION TELLS US
4813-248638-0017 HE WALKED ON FOOT DOWN THE HILL SHAKING HANDS WITH HIS NEIGHBORS PATRIOT AND TORY ALIKE WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES AS HE LEFT BEHIND HIM THE GARDEN AND THE TREES HE HAD PLANTED AND THE HOUSE WHERE HE HAD SO HAPPILY LIVED
4813-248638-0018 THE VIEW FROM THE BACK HOLDS EVEN MORE INTIMATE ATTRACTION HERE IS THE OLD OLD GARDEN AND ALTHOUGH THE EPHEMERAL BLOSSOMS OF THE PRESENT SPRINGTIME SHINE BRIGHTLY FORTH THE BOX FULL TWENTY FEET HIGH SPEAKS OF ANOTHER EPOCH
4813-248638-0019 THAT VISITORS ON ENTERING FROM THE STREET MIGHT SEE THE GLEAM OF HIS GOLD KNEE BUCKLES AS HE STOOD ON THE DISTANT PORCH THE AVENUE HOWEVER WAS NEVER COMPLETED AS BELCHER WAS APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF AND TRANSFERRED TO NEW JERSEY SHORTLY AFTER
4813-248638-0020 TWO OTHER MEN OF NOTE WHO SINCE THE DAYS OF OUR YEARS ARE BUT THREESCORE AND TEN CHOSE THAT THEIR DAYS WITHOUT NUMBER SHOULD BE SPENT IN THE TOWN THEY LOVED WERE WENDELL PHILLIPS AND RIMMER THE SCULPTOR WHO ARE BOTH BURIED AT MILTON
4813-248638-0021 NOT ONLY NOTABLE PERSONAGES BUT NOTABLE EVENTS HAVE BEEN ENGENDERED UNDER THE SHADOW OF THESE HILLS THE SUFFOLK RESOLVES WHICH WERE THE PRELUDE OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WERE ADOPTED AT THE VOSE HOUSE
4813-248638-0022 STILL RETAINS IN ITS BROAD HOSPITABLE LINES SOME SHRED OF ITS ANCIENT CHARM MILTON IS FULL OF HISTORY FROM THE REVOLUTIONARY DAYS WHEN THE CANNONADING AT BUNKER HILL SHOOK THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE HOUSES BUT NOT THE NERVES OF THE MILTON LADIES
4813-248638-0023 WHEN THE FOURTH LIBERTY LOAN OF TWO MILLION NINE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS WAS SUBSCRIBED FROM A POPULATION OF NINE THOUSAND ALL THE VARIOUS VICISSITUDES OF PEACE AND WAR HAVE BEEN SUSTAINED ON THE HIGH LEVEL
4813-248638-0024 THAT ONE MIGHT EXPECT FROM MEN AND WOMEN NOBLY NURTURED BY THE STRENGTH OF THE HILLS HOW MUCH OF ITS SUCCESS MILTON ATTRIBUTES TO ITS LOCATION FOR ONE JOINS INDEED A DISTINGUISHED FELLOWSHIP WHEN ONE BUILDS UPON A HILL
4813-248638-0025 OR ON SEVERAL HILLS AS ROMAN AS WELL AS BOSTONIAN HISTORY TESTIFIES CAN ONLY BE GUESSED BY ITS TRIBUTE IN THE FORM OF THE BLUE HILLS RESERVATION THIS STATE RECREATION PARK AND FOREST RESERVE
4813-248638-0026 OF ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND ACRES A LABYRINTH OF IDYLLIC FOOTPATHS AND LEAFY TRAILS OF TWISTING DRIVES AND WALKS THAT OPEN OUT UPON SUPERB VISTAS IS NOW THE PROPERTY OF THE PEOPLE OF MASSACHUSETTS THE GRANITE QUARRY MAN
4813-248638-0027 FAR MORE INTERESTED IN THE VALUE OF THE STONE THAT UNDERLAY THE WOODED SLOPES THAN IN RUSKIN'S THEORY OF ITS PURIFYING EFFECT UPON THE INHABITANTS HAD ALREADY OBTAINED A FOOTING HERE WHEN UNDER THE ABLE LEADERSHIP OF CHARLES FRANCIS ADAMS
4813-248638-0028 THE WHOLE REGION WAS TAKEN OVER BY THE STATE IN EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR AS YOU PASS THROUGH THE RESERVATION AND IF YOU ARE TAKING EVEN THE MOST CURSORY GLIMPSE OF MILTON YOU MUST INCLUDE SOME PORTION OF THIS PARK
4813-248638-0029 THE RACE TRACK WITH ITS JUDGES STANDS IS STILL THERE BUT THERE ARE NO MORE HORSE RACES ALTHOUGH THE FORBES FAMILY STILL HOLDS A CONSPICUOUS PLACE
4813-248638-0030 YOU MAY SEE TOO A SOLITARY FIGURE WITH A SCIENTIST'S STOOP OR A TUTOR WITH A GROUP OF BOYS MAKING A FIRST HAND STUDY OF A REGION WHICH IS FULL OF INTEREST TO THE GEOLOGIST CIRCLING THUS AROUND THE BASE OF THE GREAT BLUE HILL
4813-248638-0031 ERECTED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR BY THE LATE A LAWRENCE ROTCH OF MILTON WHO BEQUEATHED FUNDS FOR ITS MAINTENANCE IT IS NOW CONNECTED WITH HARVARD UNIVERSITY
4813-248638-0032 ONCE AT THE TOP THE EYE IS OVERWHELMED BY A CIRCUIT OF MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES IT IS ALMOST TOO IMMENSE AT FIRST ALMOST AS BARREN AS AN EMPTY EXPANSE OF ROLLING GREEN SEA BUT AS THE EYE GROWS ACCUSTOMED TO THE STRETCHING DISTANCES
4813-248638-0033 OBJECTS BOTH NEAR AND FAR BEGIN TO APPEAR AND SOON IF THE DAY IS CLEAR BUILDINGS MAY BE IDENTIFIED IN MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE VILLAGES WE ARE SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE FEET ABOVE THE SEA ON THE HIGHEST COASTLAND
4813-248638-0034 FROM AGAMENTICUS NEAR YORK MAINE TO THE RIO GRANDE AND THE PANORAMA THUS UNROLLED IS TRULY MAGNIFICENT FACING NORTHERLY WE CAN EASILY DISTINGUISH CAMBRIDGE SOMERVILLE AND MALDEN
4813-248638-0035 AND FAR BEYOND THE HILLS OF ANDOVER AND GEORGETOWN A LITTLE TO THE EAST BOSTON WITH ITS GILDED DOME THEN THE HARBOR WITH ITS ISLANDS HEADLANDS AND FORTIFICATIONS
4813-248638-0036 AS FAR AS EASTERN POINT LIGHTHOUSE IN GLOUCESTER FORTY MILES TO THE NORTHEAST APPEAR THE TWIN LIGHTHOUSES ON THATCHER'S ISLAND SEEMING FROM HERE TO BE STANDING NOT ON THE LAND BUT OUT IN THE OCEAN
4813-248638-0037 WHILE BEYOND IT STRETCHES MASSACHUSETTS BAY TURNING NEARLY EAST THE EYE PASSING OVER CHICKATAWBUT HILL THREE MILES OFF AND SECOND IN HEIGHT OF THE BLUE HILLS FOLLOWS THE BEAUTIFUL CURVE OF NANTASKET BEACH
4813-248638-0038 AND THE POINTING FINGER OF MINOT'S LIGHT FACING NEARLY SOUTH THE LONG RIDGE OF MANOMET HILL IN PLYMOUTH THIRTY THREE MILES AWAY STANDS CLEAR AGAINST THE SKY WHILE TWENTY SIX MILES AWAY IN DUXBURY ONE SEES THE MYLES STANDISH MONUMENT
4813-248638-0039 AND FAR BEYOND IT IS THE GRAND MONADNOCK IN JAFFREY
4813-248638-0040 WITH ITS TWO EQUAL SUMMITS THE NEXT GROUP TO THE RIGHT IS IN LYNDEBORO AT THE RIGHT OF LYNDEBORO AND NEARLY OVER THE READVILLE RAILROAD STATIONS IS JOE ENGLISH HILL AND TO COMPLETE THE ROUND NEARLY NORTH NORTHWEST ARE THE SUMMITS
4813-248638-0041 OF THE UNCANOONUC MOUNTAINS FIFTY NINE MILES AWAY THIS THEN IS THE GREAT BLUE HILL OF MILTON THOSE WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS AND NEW ENGLAND CAN STAND HERE AND PICK OUT A HUNDRED DISTINGUISHING LANDMARKS
4813-248638-0042 AND THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE MAY FIND AN UNPARALLELED OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THE WHOLE REGION AT ONE SWEEP OF THE EYE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF TOPOGRAPHY THE SUMMIT OF GREAT BLUE HILL IS THE PLACE TO REACH BUT FOR THE SENSE OF MYSTERIOUS BEAUTY
4813-248638-0043 THE HILL ITSELF SEEN FROM A DISTANCE FLOATING LIGHTLY LIKE A VAST BLUE BALL AGAINST A VASTER SKY IS DREAMILY SUGGESTIVE IN A WAY WHICH THE ACTUAL VIEW SUPERB AS IT IS IS NOT
4813-248638-0044 ONE REMEMBERS STEVENSON'S OBSERVATION THAT SOMETIMES TO TRAVEL HOPEFULLY IS BETTER THAN TO ARRIVE SO LET US COME DOWN FOR AFTER ALL LOVE IS OF THE VALLEY DOWN AGAIN TO THE OLD TOWN OF MILTON
4813-248638-0045 WE HAVE NOT HALF BEGUN TO WANDER OVER IT NOT HALF BEGUN TO HEAR THE PLEASANT STORIES IT HAS TO TELL WHEN ONE IS AS OLD AS THIS FOR MILTON WAS DISCOVERED BY A BAND FROM PLYMOUTH WHO CAME UP THE NEPONSET RIVER IN SIXTEEN TWENTY ONE
4813-248638-0046 WHICH DRIFTS TO US WITH A TURN OF THE WIND COMES FROM A CHOCOLATE MILL WHOSE TRADE MARK OF A NEAT HANDED MAID WITH HER LITTLE TRAY IS KNOWN ALL OVER THE CIVILIZED WORLD
4813-248638-0047 AND THOSE MILLS STAND UPON THE SITE OF THE FIRST GRIST MILL IN NEW ENGLAND TO BE RUN BY WATER POWER THIS WAS IN SIXTEEN THIRTY FOUR AND ONE LIKES TO PICTURE THE STURDY COLONISTS TRAILING INTO TOWN THEIR PACKS UPON THEIR BACKS
4813-248638-0048 LIKE CHILDREN IN KINDERGARTEN GAMES TO HAVE THEIR GRAIN GROUND ISRAEL STOUGHTON WAS THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO ESTABLISHED THIS FIRST MILL A NAME PERPETUATED
4813-248638-0049 ALL GROUND IS HISTORIC GROUND IN MILTON THAT ROLLICKING GROUP OF SCHOOLBOYS YONDER BELONGS TO AN ACADEMY WHICH HANDSOME AND FLOURISHING AS IT IS TO DAY WAS FOUNDED AS LONG AGO AS SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
4813-248638-0050 SET AGAINST A STONE WALL NEAR ITS ORIGINAL SITE THIS EARLY CHURCH AND EARLY SCHOOL WAS A LOG CABIN WITH A THATCHED ROOF AND LATTICED WINDOWS IF ONE MAY BELIEVE THE RELIEF
4813-248638-0051 BUT MEN OF BRAINS AND CHARACTER WERE TAUGHT THERE LESSONS WHICH STOOD THEM AND THE COLONY IN GOOD STEAD ONE FANCIES THE STUDENTS ROVING EYES MAY HAVE OCCASIONALLY STRAYED DOWN THE INDIAN TRAIL DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE OLD SITE A TRAIL WHICH
4813-248638-0052 ALTHOUGH NOW ATTAINED TO THE PROUD RANK OF A LANE CHURCHILL'S LANE STILL INVITES ONE DOWN ITS TANGLED GREEN WAY ALONG THE GRAY STONE WALL YES EVERY STEP OF GROUND HAS ITS TRADITION HERE
4813-248638-0053 YONDER RAILROAD TRACK MARKS THE SPOT WHERE THE VERY FIRST TIE IN THE COUNTRY WAS LAID AND LAID FOR NO LESS SIGNIFICANT PURPOSE THAN TO FACILITATE THE CARRYING OF GRANITE BLOCKS FOR BUNKER HILL MONUMENT FROM THEIR QUARRY TO THE HARBOR GRANITE FROM THE HILLS
4813-248638-0054 AGAIN WE ARE DRAWN BACK TO THE IRRESISTIBLE MAGNET OF THOSE MIGHTY MONITORS YES WHEREVER ONE GOES IN MILTON EITHER ON FOOT TO DAY OR BACK THROUGH THE CHAPTERS OF THREE CENTURIES AGO THE BLUE HILLS DOMINATE EVERY EVENT
4813-248638-0055 AND THE GREAT BLUE HILL FLOATS ABOVE THEM ALL
4813-248641-0000 MANY OF THE CARS ARE MODERATELY PRICED AFFAIRS THE TONNEAU WELL FILLED WITH CHILDREN OF MISCELLANEOUS AGES AND ENLIVENED BY A FAMILY DOG OR TWO FOR THIS IS THE WAY THAT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD SPENDS ITS MODERN SABBATH HOLIDAY
4813-248641-0001 FOR A ROAD ORIGINALLY MARKED BY THE MOCCASINED FEET OF INDIANS AND WIDENED GRADUALLY BY THE TOILSOME JOURNEYINGS OF ROUGH COLONIAL CARTS AND COACHES
4813-248641-0002 IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHICH FEATURE OF THE STEADILY MOVING TRAVEL WOULD MOST FORCIBLY STRIKE THE ORIGINAL PURITAN SETTLERS OF THE TOWN THE FACT THAT EVEN THE COMMON MAN THE POOR MAN COULD OWN SUCH A VEHICLE OF SPEED AND EASE OR THE FACT THAT AMERICA
4813-248641-0003 SUCH A SHORT TIME AGO A WILDERNESS COULD PRODUCE NOT AS THE FINEST FLOWER ON ITS TREE OF EVOLUTION BUT CERTAINLY AS ITS MOST EXOTIC THE PLUTOCRAT WHO LIVES IN A PALACE WITH FIFTY SERVANTS TO DO HIS BIDDING
4813-248641-0004 AND THE FINE LADY WHOSE SOLE EXERCISE OF HER MENTAL AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONS CONSISTS IN ALLOWING HER MAID TO DRESS HER YES NEW ENGLAND HAS CHANGED AMAZINGLY IN THE REVOLUTIONS OF THREE CENTURIES
4813-248641-0005 AND HERE UNDER THE SHADOW OF THIS SQUARE PLAIN BUILDING HINGHAM'S OLD SHIP CHURCH WHILE WE PAUSE TO WATCH THE SUNDAY PAGEANT OF NINETEEN TWENTY WE CAN MOST EASILY CALL BACK THE SABBATH RITES AND THE IDEALS WHICH CREATED THOSE RITES
4813-248641-0006 THIS WOODEN MEETING HOUSE WITH THE TRUNCATED PYRAMIDAL ROOF AND BELFRY TO SERVE AS A LOOKOUT STATION HAS JUST BEEN BUILT A STAGE AHEAD ARCHITECTURALLY OF THE LOG MEETING HOUSE WITH CLAY FILLED CHINKS THATCHED ROOF OILED PAPER WINDOWS
4813-248641-0007 EARTHEN FLOOR AND A STAGE BEHIND THE CHARMING STEEPLE STYLE MADE POPULAR BY SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN AND NOW MULTIPLIED IN COUNTLESS GRACEFUL EXAMPLES ALL OVER NEW ENGLAND
4813-248641-0008 THE OLD SHIP IS ENTIRELY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS AWAITING IT THE DISTINCTION OF BEING THE OLDEST HOUSE FOR PUBLIC WORSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH STILL STANDS ON ITS ORIGINAL SITE AND WHICH IS STILL USED FOR ITS ORIGINAL PURPOSE
4813-248641-0009 IN THE YEAR SIXTEEN EIGHTY ONE IT IS MERELY THE NEW MEETING HOUSE OF THE LITTLE HAMLET OF HINGHAM THE PEOPLE ARE VERY PROUD OF THEIR NEW BUILDING THE TIMBERS HAVE BEEN HEWN WITH THE BROAD AXE OUT OF SOLID WHITE PINE
4813-248641-0010 THE MARKS ARE STILL VISIBLE PARTICULARLY IN THOSE RAFTERS OF THE ROOF OPEN TO THE ATTIC THE BELFRY IS PRECISELY IN THE CENTER OF THE FOUR SIDED PITCHED ROOF TO BE SURE THIS NECESSITATES RINGING THE BELL FROM ONE OF THE PEWS
4813-248641-0011 BUT A LITTLE LATER THE BELLRINGER WILL STAND ABOVE AND THROUGH A PANE OF GLASS LET INTO THE CEILING HE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE WHEN THE MINISTER ENTERS THE PULPIT THE ORIGINAL BACKLESS BENCHES WERE REPLACED BY BOX PEWS WITH NARROW SEATS LIKE SHELVES
4813-248641-0012 NO PAINT NO DECORATIONS NO COLORED WINDOWS NO ORGAN OR ANYTHING WHICH COULD EVEN REMOTELY SUGGEST THE COLOR THE BEAUTY THE FORMALISM OF THE CHURCHES OF ENGLAND
4813-248641-0013 SINCE IN SIXTEEN THIRTY FIVE THE GENERAL COURT DECREED THAT NO DWELLING
4813-248641-0014 OF ANY NEW PLANTATION THUS ELIMINATING THE EXCUSE OF TOO GREAT DISTANCE EVERY ONE IS EXPECTED NAY COMMANDED TO COME TO CHURCH IN FACT AFTER THE TOLLING OF THE LAST BELL THE HOUSES MAY ALL BE SEARCHED
4813-248641-0015 EACH TEN FAMILIES IS UNDER AN INSPECTOR IF THERE IS ANY QUESTION OF DELINQUENTS HIDING IN THEM AND SO IN TWOS AND THREES OFTEN THE MAN TRUDGING AHEAD WITH HIS GUN AND THE WOMAN CARRYING HER BABY WHILE THE SMALLER CHILDREN CLING TO HER SKIRTS
4813-248641-0016 SOMETIMES MAN AND WOMAN AND A CHILD OR TWO ON HORSEBACK NO MATTER HOW WILD THE STORM HOW SWOLLEN THE STREAMS HOW DEEP THE WHIRLING SNOW THEY ALL COME TO CHURCH
4813-248641-0017 THE CONGREGATION EITHER WAITS FOR THE MINISTER AND HIS WIFE OUTSIDE THE DOOR OR STANDS UNTIL HE HAS ENTERED THE PULPIT ONCE INSIDE THEY ARE SEATED WITH THE MOST METICULOUS EXACTNESS ACCORDING TO RANK AGE SEX AND WEALTH
4813-248641-0018 AND THE SLAVES AND INDIANS ARE IN THE REAR TO SEAT ONE'S SELF IN THE WRONG PUE IS AN OFFENSE PUNISHABLE BY A FINE HERE IS THE CHURCH AND HERE ARE THE PEOPLE AS THE OLD RHYME HAS IT WHAT THEN OF THE SERVICES
4813-248641-0019 THAT THEY ARE INTERMINABLE WE KNOW THE TITHING MAN OR CLERK MAY TURN THE BRASS BOUND HOURGLASS BY THE SIDE OF THE PULPIT TWO AND THREE TIMES DURING THE SERMON AND ONCE OR TWICE DURING THE PRAYER INTERMINABLE
4813-248641-0020 THE OLD SHIP WAS NOT HEATED UNTIL EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWO THE ONLY RELIEF FROM THE CHILL AND STIFFNESS COMES DURING THE PRAYER WHEN THE CONGREGATION STANDS KNEELING OF COURSE WOULD SAVOR TOO STRONGLY OF IDOLATRY AND THE CHURCH OF ROME
4813-248641-0021 THEY STAND TOO WHILE THE PSALMS AND HYMNS ARE LINED OUT AND AS THEY SING THEM VERY UNCERTAINLY AND VERY INCORRECTLY THIS PERFORMANCE ALONE SOMETIMES TAKES AN HOUR AS THERE IS NO ORGAN NOR NOTES
4813-248641-0022 AND ONLY A FEW COPIES OF THE BAY PSALM BOOK OF WHICH BY THE WAY A COPY NOW WOULD BE WORTH MANY TIMES ITS WEIGHT IN GOLD AFTER THE MORNING SERVICE THERE IS A NOON INTERMISSION IN WHICH THE HALF FROZEN CONGREGATION STIRS AROUND
4813-248641-0023 ONE SOMETIMES WONDERS HOW THE LITTLE THINGS HAD ANY IMPULSE TO LAUGH IN SUCH AN ABYSMAL ATMOSPHERE BUT APPARENTLY THE PURITAN BOYS AND GIRLS WERE ENTIRELY NORMAL AND EVEN WHOLESOMELY MISCHIEVOUS AS PROVED BY THE CONSTANTLY REQUIRED SERVICES OF THE TITHING MAN
4813-248641-0024 THESE EXTERNAL TRAPPINGS OF THE SERVICE SOUND DEPRESSING ENOUGH BUT IF THE MESSAGE RECEIVED WITHIN THESE CHILLY WALLS IS CHEERING MAYBE WE CAN FORGET OR IGNORE THE PHYSICAL DISCOMFORTS BUT IS THE MESSAGE CHEERING HELL DAMNATION ETERNAL TORTURES
4813-248641-0025 PAINFUL THEOLOGICAL HAIR SPLITTINGS HARROWING SELF EXAMINATIONS AND HUMILIATING PUBLIC CONFESSIONS THIS IS WHAT THEY GATHER ON THE NARROW WOODEN BENCHES TO LISTEN TO HOUR AFTER HOUR SEARCHING THEIR SOULS FOR SIN WITH AN ALMOST FRENZIED EAGERNESS
4813-248641-0026 APPEALING TO THE EMOTIONS QUITE AS VIVIDLY ALTHOUGH THROUGH A DIFFERENT CHANNEL AS THE MOST ELABORATE CEREMONIAL WHEN THE SOUL IS WROUGHT TO A CERTAIN PITCH EACH HARDSHIP IS MERELY AN ADDED OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE ITS FAITH
4813-248641-0027 FROM THE MOTHER CHURCH AND THE MOTHER COUNTRY AND FORTIFY THEM IN THEIR STRUGGLE IN A NEW LAND IT WAS RELIGIOUS ZEAL WHICH FURNISHED THIS MOTIVE POWER DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTS AND DIFFERENTLY DIRECTED FORCE ARE NEEDED TO EXTRACT THE DIAMOND FROM THE EARTH
4813-248641-0028 HAVING DONE ITS WORK HAVING FOUNDED SOUNDLY AND PEOPLED STRONGLY AN EXCEPTIONAL REGION THE NEW ENGLAND CONSCIENCE HAD NO FURTHER NECESSITY FOR BEING THOSE WHOM IT NOW TORTURES WITH ITS HOT PINCERS OF DOUBT AND SELF REPROACH
4813-248641-0029 ARE SACRIFICED TO A CAUSE LONG SINCE WON THE PURITANS THEMSELVES GREW AWAY FROM MANY OF THEIR EXCESSIVE SEVERITIES BUT AS THEY GAINED BODILY STRENGTH FROM THEIR CONFLICT WITH THE ELEMENTS SO THEY GAINED A CERTAIN MORAL STAMINA
4813-248641-0030 BY THEIR SELF IMPOSED RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCE AND THIS MORAL STAMINA HAS MARKED NEW ENGLAND EVER SINCE AND MARKED HER TO HER GLORY ONE CANNOT SPEAK OF HINGHAM CHURCHES INDEED ONE CANNOT SPEAK OF HINGHAM
4813-248641-0031 WITHOUT ADMIRING MENTION OF THE NEW NORTH CHURCH THIS BUILDING OF EXQUISITE PROPORTIONS AND FINISH WITHIN AND WITHOUT BUILT BY BULFINCH IN EIGHTEEN O SIX IS ONE OF THE MOST FLAWLESS EXAMPLES OF ITS TYPE ON THE SOUTH SHORE
4813-248641-0032 YOU WILL APPRECIATE THE CREAM COLORED PAINT THE BUFF WALLS THE QUAINT BOX PEWS OF OILED WOOD WITH HANDRAILS GLEAMING FROM THE TOUCH OF MANY GENERATIONS WITH WOODEN BUTTONS AND PROTRUDING HINGES PROCLAIMING AN ANCIENT FASHION
4813-248641-0033 BUT THE UNIQUE FEATURE OF THE NEW NORTH CHURCH IS ITS SLAVE GALLERIES THESE TWO SMALL GALLERIES BETWEEN THE ROOF AND THE CHOIR LOFT HELD FOR THIRTY YEARS IN DIMINISHING NUMBERS NEGROES AND INDIANS
4813-248641-0034 THE LAST OCCUPANT WAS A BLACK LUCRETIA WHO AFTER BEING FREED WAS INVITED TO SIT DOWNSTAIRS WITH HER MASTER AND MISTRESS WHICH SHE DID AND WHICH SHE CONTINUED TO DO UNTIL HER DEATH NOT SO VERY LONG AGO
4813-248641-0035 HINGHAM ITS MAIN STREET ALAS FOR THE ORIGINAL NAME OF BACHELORS ROWE ARCHED BY A DOUBLE ROW OF SUPERB ELMS ON EITHER SIDE IS INCALCULABLY RICH IN OLD HOUSES OLD TRADITIONS OLD FAMILIES
4813-248641-0036 EVEN MOTORING THROUGH TOO QUICKLY AS MOTORISTS MUST ONE CANNOT HELP BEING STRUCK BY THE SUBSTANTIAL DIGNITY OF THE PLACE BY THE WELL KEPT PROSPERITY OF THE HOUSES LARGE AND SMALL WHICH FRINGE THE FINE OLD HIGHWAY
4813-248641-0037 THE TOWN HAS PRESERVED A CRANFORD LIKE CHARM AND WHY NOT WHEN THE VERY HOUSE IS STILL HANDSOMELY PRESERVED WHERE THE NAMELESS NOBLEMAN FRANCIS LE BARON WAS CONCEALED BETWEEN THE FLOORS
4813-248641-0038 AND AS WE ARE TOLD IN MISSUS AUSTEN'S NOVEL VERY PROPERLY CAPPED THE CLIMAX BY MARRYING HIS BRAVE LITTLE PROTECTOR MOLLY WILDER WHY NOT WHEN THE LINCOLN FAMILY ANCESTORS OF ABRAHAM
4813-248641-0039 NAMED AFTER THE INDIAN CHIEF WHO GRANTED THE ORIGINAL DEEDS OF THE TOWN HAS FOUND QUARTERS IN AN EXTREMELY INTERESTING HOUSE DATING FROM SIXTEEN EIGHTY IN THE SPACIOUS LIVING ROOM ARE SEVENTEEN PANELS ON THE WALLS AND IN THE DOORS
4813-248641-0040 PAINTED WITH CHARMING OLD FASHIONED SKILL BY JOHN HAZLITT THE BROTHER OF THE ENGLISH ESSAYIST THE REVEREND DANIEL SHUTE HOUSE BUILT IN SEVENTEEN FORTY SIX IS PRACTICALLY INTACT WITH ITS PANELED ROOMS
4813-248641-0041 AND WALL PAPER A HUNDRED YEARS OLD HINGHAM'S FAMOUS ELMS SHADE THE HOUSE WHERE PARSON EBENEZER GAY LIVED OUT HIS LONG PASTORATE OF SIXTY NINE YEARS AND NINE MONTHS AND THE GARRISON HOUSE BUILT BEFORE SIXTEEN FORTY
4813-248641-0042 SHELTERED IN ITS PRIME NINE GENERATIONS OF THE SAME FAMILY THE RAINBOW ROOF HOUSE SO CALLED FROM THE DELICIOUS CURVE IN ITS ROOF IS ONE OF HINGHAM'S PRETTIEST TWO HUNDRED YEAR OLD COTTAGES AND MISS SUSAN B WILLARD'S COTTAGE
4813-248641-0043 IS ONE OF THE OLDEST IN THE UNITED STATES DERBY ACADEMY FOUNDED ALMOST TWO CENTURIES AND A HALF AGO BY MADAM DERBY STILL MAINTAINS ITS SOCIAL AND SCHOLARLY PRESTIGE THROUGH ALL THE EDUCATIONAL TURMOIL OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
4813-248641-0044 THAT JOHN ALBION ANDREW WHO PROVED HIMSELF SO TRULY ONE OF OUR GREAT MEN DURING THE CIVIL WAR COURTED ELIZA JONES HERSEY AND HERE THAT THE HAPPY YEARS OF THEIR EARLY MARRIED LIFE WERE SPENT
4813-248641-0045 LATER ANOTHER GOVERNOR JOHN D LONG WAS FOR MANY YEARS A MIGHTY FIGURE IN THE TOWN WITH ITS ANCIENT CHURCHES AND INSTITUTIONS ITS PENSIVE GRAVEYARDS AND LOVELY ELMS
4813-248641-0046 HINGHAM TYPIFIES WHAT IS QUAINTEST AND BEST IN NEW ENGLAND TOWNS POSSIBLY THE DAPPLING OF THE ELMS POSSIBLY THE SHADOW OF THE OLD SHIP CHURCH
4813-248641-0047 HOWEVER IT MAY SEEM TO ITS INHABITANTS TO THE STRANGER EVERYTHING IN HINGHAM IS TINCTURED BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE STERN OLD ECCLESIASTICISM EVEN THE NUMBER OF HISTORIC FORTS SEEMS A PROPER PART OF THOSE RIGHTEOUS DAYS
4813-248641-0048 FOR WHEN DID RELIGION AND WARFARE NOT GO HAND IN HAND DURING THE TROUBLE WITH KING PHILIP THE TOWN HAD THREE FORTS ONE AT FORT HILL ONE AT THE CEMETERY AND ONE ON THE PLAIN ABOUT A MILE FROM THE HARBOR AND THE SITES MAY STILL BE IDENTIFIED
4813-248641-0049 WERE LANDED ON THEIR SALTY DECKS FOR FIFTY YEARS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN ELEVEN AND EIGHTEEN SIXTY THE RAPID SAILED AS A PACKET BETWEEN THIS TOWN AND BOSTON MAKING THE TRIP ON ONE MEMORABLE OCCASION IN SIXTY SEVEN MINUTES
4813-248641-0050 SHE WAS CARRIED UP THE WEYMOUTH RIVER AND COVERED MASTS AND HULL WITH GREEN BUSHES SO THAT THE MARAUDING BRITISH CRUISERS MIGHT NOT FIND HER AND AS WE READ WE FIND OURSELVES REMEMBERING THAT CAMOUFLAGE IS NEW ONLY IN NAME
4813-248641-0051 OR WOULD THEY REALIZE THAT THEIR SOWING HAD BROUGHT FORTH RICHER FRUIT THAN THEY COULD GUESS IT HAS ALL CHANGED SINCE PURITAN DAYS AND YET PERHAPS IN NO OTHER PLACE IN NEW ENGLAND DOES THE HAND OF THE PAST LIE SO VISIBLY UPON THE COMMUNITY
4813-248641-0052 YOU CANNOT LIFT YOUR EYES BUT THEY REST UPON SOME BUILDING RAISED TWO CENTURIES AND MORE AGO THE SHADE WHICH RIPPLES UNDER YOUR FEET IS CAST BY ELMS PLANTED BY THAT VERY HAND OF THE PAST EVEN YOUR VOICE REPEATS THE WORDS WHICH THOSE OLD PATRIARCHS
4813-248641-0053 WELL VERSED IN BIBLICAL LORE CHOSE FOR THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD NAMES ACCORD POND AND GLAD TIDINGS PLAIN MIGHT HAVE BEEN LIFTED FROM SOME PILGRIM'S PROGRESS WHILE THE NEAR BY SEA OF GALILEE AND JERUSALEM ROAD
4813-248641-0054 ARE FROM THE GOOD BOOK ITSELF WHICH WAY TO EGYPT IS THIS AN ECHO FROM THAT TIME WHEN THE BIBLE WAS THE CORNER STONE OF CHURCH AND STATE OF HOME AND SCHOOL WHAT'S THE BEST ROAD TO JERICHO BEACH SURELY IT IS SOME GRAVE FACED SHADE WHO CALLS
4830-25898-0000 THERE NEVER WAS A PROUDER MAMMA THAN MADAM CLUCK WHEN SHE LED FORTH HER FAMILY OF EIGHT DOWNY LITTLE CHICKS CHANTICLEER STRUT SNOWBALL SPECKLE PEEP PECK DOWNY AND BLOT WERE THEIR NAMES
4830-25898-0001 AND NO SOONER WERE THEY OUT OF THE SHELL THAN THEY BEGAN TO CHIRP AND SCRATCH AS GAILY AS IF THE BIG WORLD IN WHICH THEY SUDDENLY FOUND THEMSELVES WAS MADE FOR THEIR ESPECIAL BENEFIT IT WAS A FINE BROOD
4830-25898-0002 BUT POOR MADAM CLUCK HAD BAD LUCK WITH HER CHICKS FOR THEY WERE HER FIRST AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO MANAGE THEM OLD AUNT COCKLETOP TOLD HER THAT SHE DIDN'T AND PREDICTED THAT THOSE POOR DEARS WOULD COME TO BAD ENDS
4830-25898-0003 AUNT COCKLETOP WAS RIGHT AS YOU WILL SEE WHEN I HAVE TOLD THE SAD HISTORY OF THIS UNFORTUNATE FAMILY THE TRAGEDY BEGAN WITH CHANTY WHO WAS THE BOLDEST LITTLE COCKADOODLE WHO EVER TRIED TO CROW
4830-25898-0004 BEFORE HE HAD A FEATHER TO HIS BIT OF A TAIL CHANTY BEGAN TO FIGHT AND SOON WAS KNOWN AS THE MOST QUARRELSOME CHICK IN THE FARM YARD HAVING PECKED HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS HE TRIED TO DO THE SAME TO HIS PLAYMATES
4830-25898-0005 THE DUCKLINGS GOSLINGS AND YOUNG TURKEYS AND WAS SO DISAGREEABLE THAT ALL THE FOWLS HATED HIM ONE DAY A PAIR OF BANTAMS ARRIVED PRETTY LITTLE WHITE BIRDS WITH RED CRESTS AND NICE YELLOW FEET
4830-25898-0006 CHANTY THOUGHT HE COULD BEAT MISTER BANTAM EASILY HE WAS SO SMALL AND INVITED HIM TO FIGHT MISTER B DECLINED THEN CHANTY CALLED HIM A COWARD AND GAVE MISSUS B A PECK
4830-25898-0007 WHICH ENDED IN CHANTY'S UTTER DEFEAT FOR HE DIED FROM HIS WOUNDS DOWNY AND SNOWBALL SOON FOLLOWED FOR THE TWO SWEET LITTLE THINGS WOULD SWING ON THE BURDOCK LEAVES THAT GREW OVER THE BROOK
4830-25898-0008 SITTING SIDE BY SIDE THE PLUMP SISTERS WERE PLACIDLY SWAYING UP AND DOWN OVER THE CLEAR BROWN WATER RIPPLING BELOW WHEN AH SAD TO RELATE THE STEM BROKE AND DOWN WENT LEAF
4830-25898-0009 CHICKENS AND ALL TO A WATERY DEATH I'M THE MOST UNLUCKY HEN EVER HATCHED GROANED
4830-25898-0010 AND IT DID SEEM SO FOR THE VERY NEXT WEEK SPECKLE THE BEST AND PRETTIEST OF THE BROOD WENT TO WALK WITH AUNT COCKLETOP GRASSHOPPERING THEY CALLED IT IN THE GREAT FIELD ACROSS THE ROAD
4830-25898-0011 WHAT A NICE TIME SPECKLE DID HAVE TO BE SURE FOR THE GRASSHOPPERS WERE LIVELY AND FAT AND AUNT WAS IN AN UNUSUALLY AMIABLE MOOD NEVER RUN AWAY FROM ANYTHING BUT FACE DANGER AND CONQUER IT
4830-25898-0012 LIKE A BRAVE CHICK SAID THE OLD BIDDY AS SHE WENT CLUCKING THROUGH THE GRASS WITH HER GRAY TURBAN WAGGING IN THE WIND SPECKLE HAD HOPPED AWAY FROM A TOAD WITH A STARTLED CHIRP WHICH CAUSED AUNT TO UTTER THAT REMARK
4830-25898-0013 THE WORDS HAD HARDLY LEFT HER BEAK WHEN A SHADOW ABOVE MADE HER LOOK UP GIVE ONE LOUD CROAK OF ALARM AND THEN SCUTTLE AWAY AS FAST AS LEGS AND WINGS COULD CARRY HER LITTLE SPECKLE REMEMBERING THE ADVICE
4830-25898-0014 AND UNCONSCIOUS OF THE DANGER STOOD HER GROUND AS A GREAT HAWK CAME CIRCLING NEARER AND NEARER TILL WITH A SUDDEN DART HE POUNCED ON THE POOR CHICKEN AND BORE IT AWAY CHIRPING DISMALLY
4830-25898-0015 WHAT SHALL I DO IT WAS A DREADFUL BLOW TO MISSUS CLUCK AND AUNT COCKLETOP DIDN'T SHOW HERSELF FOR A WHOLE DAY AFTER THAT STORY WAS KNOWN
4830-25898-0016 FOR EVERY FOWL IN THE YARD TWITTED HER WITH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HER PREACHING AND HER PRACTICE
4830-25898-0017 HE WAS AT IT FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT AND EVERYONE WAS TIRED TO DEATH OF HEARING HIS SHRILL SMALL VOICE MAKING FUNNY ATTEMPTS TO PRODUCE HOARSE LITTLE CROWS AS HE SAT ON THE WALL AND STRETCHED HIS YELLOW NECK
4830-25898-0018 TILL HIS THROAT QUITE ACHED WITH THE EFFORT AH IF I COULD ONLY FLY TO THE HIGHEST BEAM IN THE BARN AND GIVE A SPLENDID CROW THAT EVERYONE COULD HEAR I SHOULD BE PERFECTLY HAPPY SAID THIS SILLY LITTLE FOWL
4830-25898-0019 SO HE TRIED EVERY DAY TO FLY AND CROW AND AT LAST MANAGED TO GET UP THEN HOW HE DID STRUT AND RUSTLE HIS FEATHERS WHILE HIS PLAYMATES SAT BELOW AND WATCHED HIM
4830-25898-0020 YOU'LL FALL AND GET HURT SAID HIS SISTER BLOT HOLD YOUR TONGUE YOU UGLY LITTLE THING AND DON'T TALK TO ME I'M GOING TO CROW AND CAN'T BE INTERRUPTED BY ANY SILLY BIT OF A HEN BE QUIET DOWN THERE
4830-25898-0021 AND HEAR IF I CAN'T DO IT AS WELL AS DADDY THE CHICKS STOPPED SCRATCHING AND PEEPING AND SAT IN A ROW TO HEAR STRUT CROW PERCHING HIMSELF ON THE BEAM HE TRIED HIS BEST
4830-25898-0022 CAME OF IT AND ALL THE CHICKS LAUGHED THAT MADE STRUT MAD AND HE RESOLVED TO CROW EVEN IF HE KILLED HIMSELF DOING IT HE GAVE AN ANGRY CLUCK FLAPPED HIS WINGS AND TRIED AGAIN ALAS ALAS
4830-25898-0023 FOR POOR STRUT HE LEANED SO FAR FORWARD IN HIS FRANTIC EFFORT TO GET A BIG CROW OUT THAT HE TOPPLED OVER AND FELL BUMP ON THE HARD BARN FLOOR KILLING HIMSELF INSTANTLY
4830-25898-0024 FOR SOME TIME AFTER THIS MISSUS CLUCK KEPT HER THREE REMAINING LITTLE ONES CLOSE TO HER SIDE WATCHING OVER THEM WITH MATERNAL CARE TILL THEY WERE HEARTILY TIRED OF HER ANXIOUS CLUCKINGS PEEP AND PECK WERE ALWAYS TOGETHER
4830-25898-0025 BEING VERY FOND OF ONE ANOTHER PEEP WAS A MOST INQUISITIVE CHICKEN POKING HER HEAD INTO EVERY NOOK AND CORNER AND NEVER SATISFIED TILL SHE HAD SEEN ALL THERE WAS TO SEE PECK WAS A GLUTTON
4830-25898-0026 EATING EVERYTHING SHE COULD FIND AND OFTEN MAKING HERSELF ILL BY GOBBLING TOO FAST AND FORGETTING TO EAT A LITTLE GRAVEL TO HELP DIGEST HER FOOD DON'T GO OUT OF THE BARN CHILDREN I'M GOING TO LAY AN EGG
4830-25898-0027 AND CAN'T LOOK AFTER YOU JUST NOW SAID THEIR MOTHER ONE DAY YES MA'AM CHIRPED THE CHICKENS AND THEN AS SHE WENT RUSTLING INTO THE HAY MOW THEY BEGAN TO RUN ABOUT AND ENJOY THEMSELVES WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
4830-25898-0028 PEEP FOUND A LITTLE HOLE INTO THE MEAL ROOM AND SLIPPED IN FULL OF JOY AT THE SIGHT OF THE BAGS BOXES AND BINS I'LL EAT ALL I WANT AND THEN I'LL CALL PECK SHE SAID
4830-25898-0029 AND HAVING TAKEN A TASTE OF EVERY THING SHE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE WHEN SHE HEARD THE STABLEMAN COMING AND IN HER FRIGHT COULDN'T FIND THE HOLE SO FLEW INTO THE MEAL BIN AND HID HERSELF
4830-25898-0030 SAM NEVER SAW HER BUT SHUT DOWN THE COVER OF THE BIN AS HE PASSED AND LEFT POOR PEEP TO DIE NO ONE KNEW WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER TILL SOME DAYS LATER WHEN SHE WAS FOUND DEAD IN THE MEAL
4830-25898-0031 WITH HER POOR LITTLE CLAWS STICKING STRAIGHT UP AS IF IMPLORING HELP PECK MEANWHILE GOT INTO MISCHIEF ALSO
4830-25898-0032 SHE STRAYED INTO THE SHEEP SHED AND FINDING SOME SALT ATE AS MUCH AS SHE LIKED NOT KNOWING THAT SALT IS BAD FOR HENS HAVING TAKEN ALL SHE WANTED SHE RAN BACK TO THE BARN
4830-25898-0033 AND WAS INNOCENTLY CATCHING GNATS WHEN HER MAMMA CAME OUT OF THE HAY MOW WITH A LOUD CUT CUT CUT
4830-25898-0034 WHERE IS PEEP ASKED MISSUS CLUCK
4830-25898-0035 THERE PECK STOPPED SUDDENLY ROLLED UP HER EYES AND BEGAN TO STAGGER ABOUT AS IF SHE WAS TIPSY MERCY ON US WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THE CHICK CRIED MISSUS CLUCK IN GREAT ALARM FITS MA'AM ANSWERED DOCTOR DRAKE
4830-25898-0036 WHO JUST THEN WADDLED BY OH WHAT CAN I DO SCREAMED THE DISTRACTED HEN NOTHING MA'AM IT'S FATAL AND THE DOCTOR WADDLED ON TO VISIT DAME PARTLET'S SON WHO WAS ILL OF THE PIP MY CHILD MY CHILD

4830-25898-0038 GASPING AND ROLLING UP HER EYES IN GREAT ANGUISH FOR SHE HAD EATEN TOO MUCH OF THE FATAL SALT AND THERE WAS NO HELP FOR HER WHEN ALL WAS OVER THEY BURIED THE DEAD CHICKEN UNDER A CURRANT BUSH COVERED THE LITTLE GRAVE WITH CHICKWEED
4830-25898-0039 AND THE BEREAVED PARENT WORE A BLACK STRING ROUND HER LEG FOR A MONTH BLOT THE LAST OF THAT BRIGHT BAND NEEDED NO MOURNING FOR SHE WAS AS BLACK AS A CROW THIS WAS THE REASON WHY HER MOTHER NEVER
4830-25898-0040 HAD LOVED HER AS MUCH AS SHE DID THE OTHERS WHO WERE ALL WHITE GRAY OR YELLOW POOR LITTLE BLOT HAD BEEN MUCH NEGLECTED BY EVERY ONE BUT NOW HER LONELY MAMMA DISCOVERED HOW GOOD AND AFFECTIONATE A CHICKEN SHE WAS
4830-25898-0041 FOR BLOT WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO HER NEVER RUNNING AWAY OR DISOBEYING IN ANY WAY BUT ALWAYS CLOSE TO HER SIDE READY TO CREEP UNDER HER WING OR BRING HER A PLUMP BUG WHEN THE POOR BIDDY'S APPETITE FAILED HER
4830-25898-0042 THEY WERE VERY HAPPY TOGETHER TILL THANKSGIVING DREW NEAR WHEN A DREADFUL PESTILENCE SEEMED TO SWEEP THROUGH THE FARM YARD FOR TURKEYS HENS DUCKS AND GEESE FELL A PREY TO IT
4830-25898-0043 AND WERE SEEN BY THEIR SURVIVING RELATIVES FEATHERLESS PALE AND STIFF BORNE AWAY TO SOME UNKNOWN PLACE WHENCE NO FOWL RETURNED BLOT WAS WAKED ONE NIGHT BY A GREAT CACKLING AND FLUTTERING IN THE HEN HOUSE
4830-25898-0044 AND PEEPING DOWN FROM HER PERCH SAW A GREAT HAND GLIDE ALONG THE ROOST CLUTCH HER BELOVED MOTHER BY THE LEG AND PULL HER OFF SCREAMING DOLEFULLY
4830-25898-0045 AUNT COCKLETOP PECKED AND CROAKED FIERCELY BUT TOUGH AS SHE WAS THE OLD BIDDY DID NOT ESCAPE AND MANY ANOTHER AMIABLE HEN AND GALLANT COCKADOODLE FELL A VICTIM TO THAT MYSTERIOUS HAND
4830-25898-0046 IN THE MORNING FEW REMAINED AND BLOT FELT THAT SHE WAS A FORLORN ORPHAN A THOUGHT WHICH CAUSED HER TO SIT WITH HER HEAD UNDER HER WING FOR SEVERAL HOURS BROODING OVER HER SAD LOT
4830-25898-0047 AND LONGING TO JOIN HER FAMILY IN SOME SAFE AND HAPPY LAND WHERE FOWLS LIVE IN PEACE SHE HAD HER WISH VERY SOON FOR ONE DAY WHEN THE FIRST SNOWFLAKES BEGAN TO FLUTTER
4830-25898-0048 BLOT SAW A LITTLE KITTEN MEWING PITIFULLY AS IT SAT UNDER THE FENCE WHAT IS THE MATTER DEAR ASKED KIND BLOT
4830-25898-0049 I LIVE AT THE RED FARM HOUSE OVER THE HILL ONLY I DON'T KNOW WHICH ROAD TO TAKE I'LL SHOW YOU COME AT ONCE FOR NIGHT IS COMING ON AND THE SNOW WILL SOON BE TOO DEEP FOR US SAID BLOT SO AWAY THEY WENT
4830-25898-0050 BUT IT WAS A LONG WAY AND DUSK CAME ON BEFORE THE RED FARM HOUSE APPEARED NOW I'M SAFE THANK YOU VERY MUCH WON'T YOU COME IN AND STAY ALL NIGHT MY MOTHER WILL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU
4830-25898-0051 SAID THE KIT RUBBING HER SOFT WHITE FACE AGAINST BLOT'S LITTLE BLACK BREAST
4830-25898-0052 SO GOOD BY DEAR AND OFF TROTTED BLOT ALONG THE SNOWY ROAD HOPING TO GET HOME BEFORE THE HEN HOUSE DOOR WAS SHUT FASTER AND FASTER FELL THE SNOW DARKER AND DARKER GREW THE NIGHT
4830-25898-0053 AND COLDER AND COLDER BECAME POOR BLOT'S LITTLE FEET AS SHE WADED THROUGH THE DRIFTS THE FIRELIGHT WAS SHINING OUT INTO THE GLOOM
4830-25898-0054 TO FIND ALL DOORS SHUT AND NO SHELTER LEFT FOR HER BUT THE BOUGH OF A LEAFLESS TREE TOO STIFF AND WEAK TO FLY UP SHE CREPT AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THE BRIGHT GLOW WHICH SHONE ACROSS THE DOOR STEP
4830-25898-0055 AND WITH A SHIVER PUT HER LITTLE HEAD UNDER HER WING TRYING TO FORGET HUNGER WEARINESS AND THE BITTER COLD AND WAIT PATIENTLY FOR MORNING BUT WHEN MORNING CAME LITTLE BLOT LAY FROZEN STIFF UNDER A COVERLET OF SNOW
4830-25904-0000 BEING ALONE IN LONDON YET WISHING TO CELEBRATE THE DAY I DECIDED TO PAY MY RESPECTS TO THE LIONS AT THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS A LOVELY PLACE IT WAS AND I ENJOYED MYSELF IMMENSELY FOR MAY DAY IN ENGLAND IS JUST WHAT IT SHOULD BE
4830-25904-0001 MILD SUNNY FLOWERY AND SPRING LIKE AS I WALKED ALONG THE WELL KEPT PATHS BETWEEN WHITE AND ROSY HAWTHORN HEDGES I KEPT COMING UPON NEW AND CURIOUS SIGHTS
4830-25904-0002 FOR THE BIRDS AND BEASTS ARE SO SKILFULLY ARRANGED THAT IT IS MORE LIKE TRAVELLING THROUGH A STRANGE AND PLEASANT COUNTRY THAN VISITING A MENAGERIE THE FIRST THING I SAW WAS A GREAT AMERICAN BISON
4830-25904-0003 AND I WAS SO GLAD TO MEET WITH ANY ONE FROM HOME THAT I'D HAVE PATTED HIM WITH PLEASURE IF HE HAD SHOWN ANY CORDIALITY TOWARD ME HE DIDN'T HOWEVER
4830-25904-0004 AND PUT DOWN HIS IMMENSE HEAD WITH A SULLEN SNORT AS IF HE'D HAVE TOSSED ME WITH GREAT SATISFACTION I DID NOT BLAME HIM FOR THE POOR FELLOW WAS HOMESICK DOUBTLESS FOR HIS OWN WIDE PRAIRIES AND THE FREE LIFE HE HAD LOST
4830-25904-0005 SO I THREW HIM SOME FRESH CLOVER AND WENT ON TO THE PELICANS I NEVER KNEW BEFORE WHAT HANDSOME BIRDS THEY WERE NOT GRACEFUL BUT WITH SUCH SNOWY PLUMAGE TINGED WITH PALE PINK AND FAINT YELLOW
4830-25904-0006 THEY HAD JUST HAD THEIR BATH AND STOOD ARRANGING THEIR FEATHERS WITH THEIR GREAT BILLS
4830-25904-0007 WHEN FED THEY GOBBLED UP THE FISH NEVER STOPPING TO SWALLOW IT TILL THE POUCHES UNDER THEIR BILLS WERE FULL THEN THEY LEISURELY EMPTIED THEM AND SEEMED TO ENJOY THEIR LUNCH WITH THE GRAVE DELIBERATION OF REGULAR ENGLISHMEN
4830-25904-0008 AND THERE FOUND A SPLENDID SIGHT SIX LIONS AND LIONESSES IN THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT CAGES SITTING OR STANDING IN DIGNIFIED ATTITUDES AND EYEING THE SPECTATORS WITH A MILD EXPRESSION IN THEIR FINE EYES
4830-25904-0009 ONE LIONESS WAS ILL AND LAY ON HER BED LOOKING VERY PENSIVE WHILE HER MATE MOVED RESTLESSLY ABOUT HER EVIDENTLY ANXIOUS TO DO SOMETHING FOR HER AND MUCH AFFLICTED BY HER SUFFERING
4830-25904-0010 I LIKED THIS LION VERY MUCH FOR THOUGH THE BIGGEST HE WAS VERY GENTLE AND HAD A NOBLE FACE THE TIGERS WERE RUSHING ABOUT AS TIGERS USUALLY ARE SOME CREEPING NOISELESSLY TO AND FRO
4830-25904-0011 SOME LEAPING UP AND DOWN AND SOME WASHING THEIR FACES WITH THEIR VELVET PAWS ALL LOOKED AND ACTED SO LIKE CATS THAT I WASN'T AT ALL SURPRISED TO HEAR ONE OF THEM PURR WHEN THE KEEPER SCRATCHED HER HEAD
4830-25904-0012 IT WAS A VERY LOUD AND LARGE PURR BUT NO FIRESIDE PUSSY COULD HAVE DONE IT BETTER AND EVERY ONE LAUGHED AT THE SOUND THERE WERE PRETTY SPOTTED LEOPARDS PANTHERS AND SMALLER VARIETIES OF THE SAME SPECIES
4830-25904-0013 I SAT WATCHING THEM A LONG TIME LONGING TO LET SOME OF THE WILD THINGS OUT FOR A GOOD RUN THEY SEEMED SO UNHAPPY BARRED IN THOSE SMALL DENS SUDDENLY THE LIONS BEGAN TO ROAR THE TIGERS TO SNARL
4830-25904-0014 AND ALL TO GET VERY MUCH EXCITED ABOUT SOMETHING SNIFFING AT THE OPENINGS THRUSTING THEIR PAWS THROUGH THE BARS AND LASHING THEIR TAILS IMPATIENTLY I COULDN'T IMAGINE WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS TILL
4830-25904-0015 THIS WAS THEIR DINNER AND AS THEY WERE FED BUT ONCE A DAY THEY WERE RAVENOUS SUCH ROARS AND HOWLS AND CRIES AS AROSE WHILE THE MAN WENT SLOWLY DOWN THE LINE
4830-25904-0016 GAVE ONE A GOOD IDEA OF THE SOUNDS TO BE HEARD IN INDIAN FORESTS AND JUNGLES THE LIONS BEHAVED BEST FOR THEY ONLY PACED UP AND DOWN WITH AN OCCASIONAL CRY BUT THE TIGERS WERE QUITE FRANTIC
4830-25904-0017 FOR THEY TUMBLED ONE OVER THE OTHER SHOOK THE CAGES AND TRIED TO REACH THE BYSTANDERS
4830-25904-0018 ONE LADY HAD A FRIGHT FOR THE WIND BLEW THE END OF HER SHAWL WITHIN REACH OF A TIGER'S GREAT CLAW AND HE CLUTCHED IT TRYING TO DRAG HER NEARER THE SHAWL CAME OFF AND THE POOR LADY RAN AWAY SCREAMING
4830-25904-0019 AS IF A WHOLE FAMILY OF WILD BEASTS WERE AFTER HER
4830-25904-0020 THE TIGERS SNARLED AND FOUGHT AND TORE AND GOT SO SAVAGE I WAS VERY GRATEFUL THAT THEY WERE SAFELY SHUT UP IN A FEW MINUTES NOTHING BUT WHITE BONES REMAINED AND THEN THEY HOWLED FOR MORE
4830-25904-0021 ONE LITTLE LEOPARD WAS BETTER BRED THAN THE OTHERS FOR HE WENT UP ON A SHELF IN THE CAGE AND ATE HIS DINNER IN A QUIET PROPER MANNER WHICH WAS AN EXAMPLE TO THE REST THE LIONS ATE IN DIGNIFIED SILENCE
4830-25904-0022 ALL BUT MY FAVOURITE WHO CARRIED HIS SHARE TO HIS SICK MATE AND BY EVERY GENTLE MEANS IN HIS POWER TRIED TO MAKE HER EAT SHE WAS TOO ILL HOWEVER AND TURNED AWAY WITH A PLAINTIVE MOAN WHICH SEEMED TO GRIEVE HIM SADLY
4830-25904-0023 HE WOULDN'T TOUCH HIS DINNER BUT LAY DOWN NEAR HER WITH THE LUMP BETWEEN HIS PAWS AS IF GUARDING IT FOR HER AND THERE I LEFT HIM PATIENTLY WAITING IN SPITE OF HIS HUNGER TILL HIS MATE COULD SHARE IT WITH HIM
4830-25904-0024 AS I TOOK A LAST LOOK AT HIS FINE OLD FACE I NAMED HIM DOUGLAS AND WALKED AWAY HUMMING TO MYSELF THE LINES OF THE BALLAD DOUGLAS DOUGLAS TENDER AND TRUE
4830-25904-0025 AS A CONTRAST TO THE WILD BEASTS I WENT TO SEE THE MONKEYS WHO LIVED IN A FINE LARGE HOUSE ALL TO THEMSELVES HERE WAS EVERY VARIETY FROM THE GREAT UGLY CHIMPANZEE TO THE FUNNY LITTLE FELLOWS
4830-25904-0026 WHO PLAYED LIKE BOYS AND CUT UP ALL SORTS OF CAPERS A MAMMA SAT TENDING HER BABY AND LOOKING SO LIKE A LITTLE OLD WOMAN THAT I LAUGHED TILL THE GRAY MONKEY WITH THE BLUE NOSE SCOLDED AT ME
4830-25904-0027 HE WAS A CROSS OLD PARTY AND SAT HUDDLED UP IN THE STRAW SCOWLING AT EVERY ONE LIKE AN ILL TEMPERED OLD BACHELOR HALF A DOZEN LITTLE ONES TEASED HIM CAPITALLY BY DROPPING BITS OF BREAD
4830-25904-0028 NUT SHELLS AND STRAWS DOWN ON HIM FROM ABOVE AS THEY CLIMBED ABOUT THE PERCHES OR SWUNG BY THEIR TAILS ONE POOR LITTLE CHAP HAD LOST THE CURLY END OF HIS TAIL I'M AFRAID THE GRAY ONE BIT IT OFF
4830-25904-0029 AND KEPT TRYING TO SWING LIKE THE OTHERS FORGETTING THAT THE STRONG CURLY END WAS WHAT HE HELD ON WITH HE WOULD RUN UP THE BARE BOUGHS AND GIVE A JUMP EXPECTING TO CATCH AND SWING BUT THE LAME TAIL WOULDN'T HOLD HIM AND DOWN HE'D GO
4830-25904-0030 BOUNCE ON TO THE STRAW AT FIRST HE'D SIT AND STARE ABOUT HIM AS IF MUCH AMAZED TO FIND HIMSELF THERE THEN HE'D SCRATCH HIS LITTLE ROUND HEAD AND BEGIN TO SCOLD VIOLENTLY WHICH SEEMED TO DELIGHT THE OTHER MONKEYS
4830-25904-0031 AND FINALLY HE'D EXAMINE HIS POOR LITTLE TAIL AND APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND THE MISFORTUNE WHICH HAD BEFALLEN HIM THE FUNNY EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE WAS IRRESISTIBLE AND I ENJOYED SEEING HIM VERY MUCH
4830-25904-0032 AND GAVE HIM A BUN TO COMFORT HIM WHEN I WENT AWAY THE SNAKE HOUSE CAME NEXT AND I WENT IN ON MY WAY TO VISIT THE RHINOCEROS FAMILY I RATHER LIKE SNAKES
4830-25904-0033 SINCE I HAD A TAME GREEN ONE WHO LIVED UNDER THE DOOR STEP AND WOULD COME OUT AND PLAY WITH ME ON SUNNY DAYS THESE SNAKES I FOUND VERY INTERESTING ONLY THEY GOT UNDER THEIR BLANKETS AND WOULDN'T COME OUT AND I WASN'T ALLOWED TO POKE THEM
4830-25904-0034 AND BLINKED AT ME THROUGH THE GLASS LOOKING QUITE AS DANGEROUS AS HE WAS THERE WERE BIG AND LITTLE SNAKES BLACK BROWN AND SPECKLED LIVELY AND LAZY PRETTY AND PLAIN ONES BUT I LIKED THE GREAT BOA
4830-25904-0035 BEST WHEN I CAME TO HIS CAGE I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING BUT THE BRANCH OF A TREE SUCH AS I HAD SEEN IN OTHER CAGES FOR THE SNAKES TO WIND UP AND DOWN WHERE IS HE I WONDER I HOPE HE HASN'T GOT
4830-25904-0036 OUT I SAID TO MYSELF THINKING OF A STORY I READ ONCE OF A PERSON IN A MENAGERIE WHO TURNED SUDDENLY AND SAW A GREAT BOA GLIDING TOWARDS HIM
4830-25904-0037 AS I STOOD WONDERING IF THE BIG WORM COULD BE UNDER THE LITTLE FLAT BLANKET BEFORE ME THE BRANCH BEGAN TO MOVE ALL AT ONCE AND WITH A START I SAW A LIMB SWING DOWN TO STARE AT ME WITH THE BOA'S GLITTERING EYES
4830-25904-0038 AND LAY SO STILL I HAD NOT SEEN HIM TILL HE CAME TO TAKE A LOOK AT ME A VERY VILLAINOUS LOOKING REPTILE HE WAS AND I FELT GRATEFUL THAT I DIDN'T LIVE IN A COUNTRY
4830-25904-0039 WHERE SUCH UNPLEASANT NEIGHBOURS MIGHT POP IN UPON YOU UNEXPECTEDLY HE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO TAKE A PROMENADE AND SHOW ME HIS SIZE WHICH SEEMED IMMENSE AS HE STRETCHED HIMSELF
4830-25904-0040 AND THEN KNOTTED HIS ROUGH GRAYISH BODY INTO A GREAT LOOP WITH THE FIERY EYED HEAD IN THE MIDDLE HE WAS NOT ONE OF THE LARGEST KIND BUT I WAS QUITE SATISFIED AND LEFT HIM TO HIS DINNER OF RABBITS
4830-25904-0041 WHICH I HADN'T THE HEART TO STAY AND SEE HIM DEVOUR ALIVE I WAS WALKING TOWARD THE CAMEL'S PAGODA WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN A LONG DARK CURLING THING CAME OVER MY SHOULDER AND I FELT WARM BREATH IN MY FACE IT'S THE BOA I THOUGHT
4830-25904-0042 MUCH TO THE AMUSEMENT OF SOME CHILDREN RIDING ON THE ELEPHANT WHOSE TRUNK HAD FRIGHTENED ME HE HAD POLITELY TRIED TO TELL ME TO CLEAR THE WAY WHICH I CERTAINLY HAD DONE WITH ALL SPEED PICKING MYSELF OUT OF THE HEDGE
4830-25904-0043 I WALKED BESIDE HIM EXAMINING HIS CLUMSY FEET AND PEERING UP AT HIS SMALL INTELLIGENT EYE I'M VERY SURE HE WINKED AT ME AS IF ENJOYING THE JOKE AND KEPT POKING HIS TRUNK INTO MY POCKET
4830-25904-0044 HOPING TO FIND SOMETHING EATABLE I FELT AS IF I HAD GOT INTO A FOREIGN COUNTRY AS I LOOKED ABOUT ME AND SAW ELEPHANTS AND CAMELS WALKING AMONG THE TREES FLOCKS OF SNOW WHITE CRANES STALKING OVER THE GRASS
4830-25904-0045 ON THEIR LONG SCARLET LEGS STRIPED ZEBRAS RACING IN THEIR PADDOCK QUEER KANGAROOS HOPPING ABOUT WITH LITTLE ONES IN THEIR POUCHES PRETTY ANTELOPES CHASING ONE ANOTHER
4830-25904-0046 AND IN AN IMMENSE WIRE COVERED AVIARY ALL SORTS OF BRILLIANT BIRDS WERE FLYING ABOUT AS GAILY AS IF AT HOME ONE OF THE CURIOSITIES WAS A SEA COW WHO LIVED IN A TANK OF SALT WATER
4830-25904-0047 AND CAME AT THE KEEPER'S CALL TO KISS HIM AND FLOUNDER ON ITS FLIPPERS ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE TANK AFTER A FISH IT WAS VERY LIKE A SEAL ONLY MUCH LARGER AND HAD FOUR FINS INSTEAD OF TWO
4830-25904-0048 ITS EYES WERE LOVELY SO DARK AND SOFT AND LIQUID BUT ITS MOUTH WAS NOT PRETTY AND I DECLINED ONE OF THE DAMP KISSES WHICH IT WAS READY TO DISPENSE AT WORD OF COMMAND
4830-25904-0049 THE GREAT POLAR BEAR LIVED NEXT DOOR AND SPENT HIS TIME SPLASHING IN AND OUT OF A POOL OF WATER OR SITTING ON A BLOCK OF ICE PANTING AS IF THE MILD SPRING DAY WAS BLAZING MIDSUMMER
4830-25904-0050 HE LOOKED VERY UNHAPPY AND I THOUGHT IT A PITY THAT THEY DIDN'T INVENT A BIG REFRIGERATOR FOR HIM THESE ARE NOT HALF OF THE WONDERFUL CREATURES I SAW
4853-27670-0000 I LAY FOR A LONG WHILE INSENSIBLE AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE RECOVERED MY MIND INSTEAD OF DYING IN THAT SWOON I MUST EVER ACCOUNT AS THE GREATEST WONDER OF A LIFE THAT HAS NOT BEEN WANTING IN THE MARVELLOUS
4853-27670-0001 I HAD NO SOONER SAT UP THAN ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND MY PRESENT SITUATION INSTANTLY CAME TO ME MY HAIR WAS STIFF WITH ICE THERE WAS NO MORE FEELING IN MY HANDS THAN HAD THEY BEEN OF STONE
4853-27670-0002 MY CLOTHES WEIGHED UPON ME LIKE A SUIT OF ARMOUR SO INFLEXIBLY HARD WERE THEY FROZEN YET I GOT UPON MY LEGS AND FOUND THAT I COULD STAND AND WALK AND THAT LIFE FLOWED WARM IN MY VEINS
4853-27670-0003 IT WAS INTENSELY DARK THE BINNACLE LAMP WAS EXTINGUISHED AND THE LIGHT IN THE CABIN BURNED TOO DIMLY TO THROW THE FAINTEST COLOUR UPON THE HATCHWAY ONE THING I QUICKLY NOTICED THAT THE GALE HAD BROKEN AND BLEW NO MORE THAN A FRESH BREEZE
4853-27670-0004 THERE WAS LESS SPITE IN ITS WASH LESS FURY IN ITS BLOW THE MULTITUDINOUS ROARING OF THE HEAVING BLACKNESS HAD SOBERED INTO A HARD AND SULLEN GROWLING A SOUND AS OF THUNDER AMONG MOUNTAINS HEARD IN A VALLEY
4853-27670-0005 THE BRIG PITCHED AND ROLLED HEAVILY MUCH OF THE BUOYANCY OF HER EARLIER DANCE WAS GONE OUT OF HER NEVERTHELESS I COULD NOT PERSUADE MYSELF THAT THIS SLUGGISHNESS WAS ALTOGETHER DUE TO THE WATER SHE HAD TAKEN IN
4853-27670-0006 IT WAS WONDERFUL HOWEVER THAT SHE SHOULD STILL BE AFLOAT NO MAN COULD HAVE HEARD THE RENDING AND GRATING OF HER SIDE AGAINST THE ICE WITHOUT SUPPOSING THAT EVERY PLANK IN IT WAS BEING TORN OUT
4853-27670-0007 FINDING THAT I HAD THE USE OF MY VOICE I HOLLOAED AS LOUDLY AS I COULD BUT NO HUMAN NOTE RESPONDED THREE OR FOUR TIMES I SHOUTED GIVING SOME OF THE PEOPLE THEIR NAMES BUT IN VAIN FATHER OF MERCY I THOUGHT
4853-27670-0008 WHAT HAS COME TO PASS IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ALL MY COMPANIONS HAVE BEEN WASHED OVERBOARD CERTAINLY FIVE MEN AT LEAST WERE LIVING BEFORE WE FOULED THE ICE AND AGAIN I CRIED OUT IS THERE ANY ONE ALIVE
4853-27670-0009 MY LONELINESS WAS MORE TERRIBLE TO ME THAN ANY OTHER CONDITION OF MY SITUATION IT WAS DREADFUL TO BE STANDING NEARLY DEAD WITH COLD IN UTTER DARKNESS
4853-27670-0010 IT WAS DREADFUL I SAY TO BE THUS PLACED AND TO FEEL THAT I WAS IN THE HEART OF THE RUDEST MOST DESOLATE SPACE OF SEA IN THE WORLD INTO WHICH THE COMMERCE OF THE EARTH DISPATCHED BUT FEW SHIPS ALL THE YEAR ROUND
4853-27670-0011 BUT NO FEATURE OF MY LAMENTABLE SITUATION SO AFFRIGHTED ME SO WORKED UPON THE PASSIONS OF MY MIND AS MY LONELINESS OH FOR ONE COMPANION
4853-27670-0012 EVEN ONE ONLY TO MAKE ME AN ECHO FOR MINE OWN SPEECH NAY GOD HIMSELF THE MERCIFUL FATHER OF ALL EVEN HE SEEMED NOT THE BLACKNESS LAY LIKE A PALL UPON THE DEEP AND UPON MY SOUL
4853-27670-0013 MISERY AND HORROR WERE WITHIN THAT SHADOW AND BEYOND IT NOTHING THAT MY SPIRIT COULD LOOK UP TO I STOOD FOR SOME MOMENTS AS ONE STUNNED AND THEN MY MANHOOD TRAINED TO SOME PURPOSE BY THE USAGE OF THE SEA
4853-27670-0014 REASSERTED ITSELF AND MAYBE I ALSO GOT SOME SLENDER COMFORT FROM OBSERVING THAT DULL AND HEAVY AS WAS THE MOTION OF THE BRIG THERE WAS YET THE BUOYANCY OF VITALITY IN HER MANNER OF MOUNTING THE SEAS AND THAT AFTER ALL
4853-27670-0015 HER CASE MIGHT NOT BE SO DESPERATE AS WAS THREATENED BY THE WAY IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN TORN AND PRECIPITATED PAST THE ICEBERG AT MOMENTS WHEN SHE PLUNGED THE WHITENESS OF THE WATER CREAMING UPON THE SURGES ON EITHER HAND
4853-27670-0016 BY PREVENTING THE SEAS WHICH WASHED ON TO THE FORECASTLE FROM CASCADING WITH THEIR FORMER VIOLENCE AFT ALSO THAT THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE MAIN AND TOP MASTS LAY UPON THE LARBOARD RAIL AND OVER THE SIDE
4853-27670-0017 MY EYES DIRECTLY SOUGHT IT AND FOUND THE TIME TWENTY MINUTES AFTER TEN THIS SIGNIFIED THAT I HAD TEN OR ELEVEN HOURS OF DARKNESS BEFORE ME
4853-27670-0018 I TOOK DOWN THE LAMP TRIMMED IT AND WENT TO THE LAZARETTE HATCH AT THE AFTER END OF THE CABIN HERE WERE KEPT THE STORES FOR THE CREW
4853-27670-0019 I SWALLOWED HALF A PANNIKIN OF THE HOLLANDS FOR THE SAKE OF THE WARMTH AND LIFE OF THE DRAUGHT AND ENTERING MY CABIN PUT ON THICK DRY STOCKINGS FIRST CHAFING MY FEET TILL I FELT THE BLOOD IN THEM
4853-27670-0020 AND I THEN WITH A SEAMAN'S DISPATCH SHIFTED THE REST OF MY APPAREL AND CANNOT EXPRESS HOW GREATLY I WAS COMFORTED BY THE CHANGE THOUGH THE JACKET AND TROUSERS I PUT ON WERE STILL DAMP WITH THE SOAKING OF PREVIOUS DAYS
4853-27670-0021 I TOOK FROM THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN A STOUT CLOAK AND THREW IT OVER ME ENVELOPING MY HEAD WHICH I HAD CASED IN A WARM FUR CAP WITH THE HOOD OF IT AND THUS EQUIPPED I LIGHTED A SMALL HAND LANTERN THAT WAS USED ON DARK NIGHTS FOR HEAVING THE LOG
4853-27670-0022 NEVERTHELESS ITS RAYS SUFFERED ME TO GUESS AT THE PICTURE OF RUIN THE DECKS OFFERED THE MAIN MAST WAS SNAPPED THREE OR FOUR FEET ABOVE THE DECK AND THE STUMP OF IT SHOWED AS JAGGED AND BARBED AS A WILD BEAST'S TEETH
4853-27670-0023 BUT I NOW NOTICED THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE HAMPER BEING ON THE LARBOARD SIDE BALANCED THE LIST THE VESSEL TOOK FROM HER SHIFTED BALLAST AND THAT SHE FLOATED ON A LEVEL KEEL WITH HER BOWS FAIR AT THE SEA
4853-27670-0024 I MOVED WITH EXTREME CAUTION CASTING THE LANTERN LIGHT BEFORE ME SOMETIMES STARTING AT A SOUND THAT RESEMBLED A GROAN THEN STOPPING TO STEADY MYSELF DURING SOME PARTICULAR WILD LEAP OF THE HULL
4853-27670-0025 UNTIL COMING ABREAST OF THE MAIN HATCH THE RAYS OF THE LANTERN STRUCK UPON A MAN'S BODY WHICH ON MY BRINGING THE FLAME TO HIS FACE PROVED TO BE CAPTAIN ROSY THERE WAS A WOUND OVER HIS RIGHT BROW
4853-27670-0026 AND AS IF THAT HAD NOT SUFFICED TO SLAY HIM THE FALL OF THE MASTS HAD IN SOME WONDERFUL MANNER WHIPPED A ROPE SEVERAL TIMES ROUND HIS BODY BINDING HIS ARMS AND ENCIRCLING HIS THROAT SO TIGHTLY
4853-27670-0027 THAT NO EXECUTIONER COULD HAVE GONE MORE ARTISTICALLY TO WORK TO PINION AND CHOKE A MAN UNDER A MASS OF RIGGING IN THE LARBOARD SCUPPERS LAY TWO BODIES AS I COULD JUST FAINTLY DISCERN
4853-27670-0028 FOR THEY LAY UNDER A WHOLE BODY OF SHROUDS COMPLICATED BY A MASS OF OTHER GEAR AGAINST WHICH LEANED A PORTION OF THE CABOOSE I VIEWED THEM LONG ENOUGH TO SATISFY MY MIND THAT THEY WERE DEAD AND THEN WITH A HEART OF LEAD TURNED AWAY
4853-27670-0029 I CROSSED TO THE STARBOARD SIDE WHERE THE DECK WAS COMPARATIVELY CLEAR AND FOUND THE BODY OF A SEAMAN NAMED ABRAHAM WISE NEAR THE FORE HATCH
4853-27670-0030 NO LANGUAGE THAT I HAVE COMMAND OF COULD PUT BEFORE YOU THE HORROR THAT POSSESSED ME AS I SAT MEDITATING UPON MY SITUATION AND RECALLING THE FACES OF THE DEAD THE WIND WAS RAPIDLY FALLING AND WITH IT THE SEA
4853-27670-0031 BUT THE MOTION OF THE BRIG CONTINUED VERY HEAVY A LARGE SWELL HAVING BEEN SET RUNNING BY THE LONG FIERCE GALE THAT WAS GONE AND THERE BEING NO UPROAR OF TEMPEST IN THE SKY TO CONFOUND THE SENSES
4853-27670-0032 I COULD HEAR A HUNDRED HARSH AND MELANCHOLY GROANING AND STRAINING SOUNDS RISING FROM THE HULL WITH NOW AND AGAIN A MIGHTY BLOW AS FROM SOME SPAR OR LUMP OF ICE ALONGSIDE WEIGHTY ENOUGH YOU WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED TO STAVE THE SHIP
4853-27670-0033 NEVERTHELESS HER CONTINUING TO FLOAT IN HER MISERABLY TORN AND MANGLED CONDITION WAS SO GREAT A MIRACLE THAT SPITE OF MY POOR SHIPMATES HAVING PERISHED AND MY OWN STATE BEING AS HOPELESS AS THE SKY WAS STARLESS
4853-27670-0034 TO JUDGE BY THE SOUND OF THE QUANTITY OF WATER IN THE VESSEL THAT SHE WAS FILLING I KNEW WELL YET NOT LEAKING SO RAPIDLY BUT THAT HAD OUR CREW BEEN PRESERVED WE MIGHT EASILY HAVE KEPT HER FREE
4853-27670-0035 I HAD NOTICED THE JOLLY BOAT BOTTOM UP NEAR THE STARBOARD GANGWAY AND SO FAR AS I COULD MAKE OUT BY THROWING THE DULL LANTERN LIGHT UPON HER SHE WAS SOUND BUT I COULD NOT HAVE LAUNCHED HER WITHOUT SEEING WHAT I WAS DOING
4853-27670-0036 AND EVEN HAD I MANAGED THIS SHE STOOD TO BE SWAMPED AND I TO BE DROWNED
4853-27671-0000 THERE WERE A FEW STARS DYING OUT IN THE DARK WEST THE ATMOSPHERE WAS CLEAR AND WHEN THE SUN ROSE I KNEW HE WOULD TURN THE SABLE PALL OVERHEAD INTO BLUENESS THE HULL LAY VERY DEEP
4853-27671-0001 I HAD AT ONE TIME DURING THE BLACK HOURS STRUCK INTO A MOURNFUL CALCULATION AND RECKONED THAT THE BRIG WOULD FLOAT SOME TWO OR THREE HOURS AFTER SUNRISE
4853-27671-0002 AND A DEEP OF ROLLING SAPPHIRE I STARTED WITH SUDDEN TERROR TO OBSERVE HOW CLOSE THE COVERING BOARD SAT UPON THE WATER AND HOW THE HEAD OF EVERY SWELL RAN PAST AS HIGH AS THE BULWARK RAIL
4853-27671-0003 YET FOR A FEW MOMENTS I STOOD CONTEMPLATING THE SCENE OF RUIN IT WAS VISIBLE NOW TO ITS MOST TRIFLING DETAIL THE FOREMAST WAS GONE SMOOTH OFF AT THE DECK IT LAY OVER THE STARBOARD BOW
4853-27671-0004 ONE EXTRAORDINARY STROKE I QUICKLY DETECTED THE JOLLY BOAT HAD LAIN STOWED IN THE LONG BOAT IT WAS THUS WE CARRIED THOSE BOATS THE LITTLE ONE LYING SNUGLY ENOUGH IN THE OTHER THE SEA THAT HAD FLOODED OUR DECKS
4853-27671-0005 HAD FLOATED THE JOLLY BOAT OUT OF THE LONG BOAT AND SWEPT IT BOTTOM UP TO THE GANGWAY WHERE IT LAY AS THOUGH GOD'S MERCY DESIGNED IT SHOULD BE PRESERVED FOR MY USE FOR NOT LONG AFTER IT HAD BEEN FLOATED OUT THE BRIG STRUCK THE BERG THE MASTS FELL
4853-27671-0006 AND THERE LAY THE LONG BOAT CRUSHED INTO STAVES THIS SIGNAL AND SURPRISING INTERVENTION FILLED MY HEART WITH THANKFULNESS THOUGH MY SPIRITS SANK AGAIN AT THE SIGHT OF MY POOR DROWNED SHIPMATES
4853-27671-0007 AND SO MADE A TACKLE BY THE HELP OF WHICH I TURNED THE JOLLY BOAT OVER I THEN WITH A HANDSPIKE PRISED HER NOSE TO THE GANGWAY SECURED A BUNCH OF ROPE ON EITHER SIDE HER TO ACT AS FENDERS OR BUFFERS
4853-27671-0008 WHEN SHE SHOULD BE LAUNCHED AND LYING ALONGSIDE RAN HER MIDWAY OUT BY THE TACKLE AND ATTACHING A LINE TO A RING BOLT IN HER BOW SHOVED HER OVER THE SIDE AND SHE FELL WITH A SPLASH SHIPPING SCARCE A HATFUL OF WATER
4853-27671-0009 BUT I MET WITH AN OAR THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE OTHER BOAT AND THIS WITH THE MAST AND SAIL I DROPPED INTO HER THE SWELL LIFTING HER UP TO MY HAND WHEN THE BLUE FOLD SWUNG PAST MY NEXT BUSINESS WAS TO VICTUAL HER
4853-27671-0010 I RAN TO THE CABIN BUT THE LAZARETTE WAS FULL OF WATER AND NONE OF THE PROVISIONS IN IT TO BE COME AT I THEREUPON RANSACKED THE CABIN AND FOUND A WHOLE DUTCH CHEESE A PIECE OF RAW PORK HALF A HAM
4853-27671-0011 EIGHT OR TEN BISCUITS SOME CANDLES A TINDER BOX SEVERAL LEMONS A LITTLE BAG OF FLOWER AND THIRTEEN BOTTLES OF BEER THESE THINGS I ROLLED UP IN A CLOTH AND PLACED THEM IN THE BOAT
4853-27671-0012 THE HEAVY SLUGGISH SODDEN MOVEMENT OF THE HULL ADVISED ME TO MAKE HASTE SHE WAS NOW BARELY LIFTING TO THE SWELL THAT CAME BRIMMING IN BROAD LIQUID BLUE BROWS TO HER STEM
4853-27671-0013 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH ANOTHER TON OF WATER WOULD SINK HER AND IF THE SWELL FELL OVER HER BOWS AND FILLED THE DECKS DOWN SHE WOULD GO I HAD A SMALL PARCEL OF GUINEAS IN MY CHEST AND WAS ABOUT TO FETCH THIS MONEY
4853-27671-0014 WHEN A SORT OF STAGGERING SENSATION IN THE UPWARD SLIDE OF THE HULL GAVE ME A FRIGHT AND WATCHING MY CHANCE I JUMPED INTO THE BOAT AND CAST THE LINE THAT HELD HER ADRIFT THE SUN WAS AN HOUR ABOVE THE HORIZON
4853-27671-0015 HEAVING VERY SLOWLY THOUGH YOU FELT THE WEIGHT OF THE MIGHTY OCEAN IN EVERY FOLD AND EASTWARDS THE SHOULDERS OF THE SWELL CATCHING THE GLORIOUS REFLECTION OF THE SUN HURLED THE SPLENDOUR ALONG
4853-27671-0016 TILL ALL THAT QUARTER OF THE SEA LOOKED TO BE A MASS OF LEAPING DAZZLE UPON THE EASTERN SEA LINE LAY A RANGE OF WHITE CLOUDS COMPACT AS THE CHALK CLIFFS OF DOVER
4853-27671-0017 SHOT WITH PEARLY LUSTRE FLOATED OVERHEAD VERY HIGH IT WAS IN TRUTH A FAIR AND PLEASANT MORNING OF AN ICY COLDNESS INDEED BUT THE AIR BEING DRY ITS SHREWDNESS WAS ENDURABLE
4853-27671-0018 WITH US HAD IT DAWNED YESTERDAY INSTEAD OF TO DAY MY COMPANIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN ALIVE AND YONDER SINKING RUINED FABRIC A TRIM SHIP CAPABLE OF BEARING US STOUTLY INTO WARM SEAS AND TO OUR HOMES AT LAST
4853-27671-0019 I THREW THE OAR OVER THE STERN OF THE BOAT TO KEEP HER NEAR TO THE BRIG NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE I DESIRED TO SEE THE LAST OF HER
4853-27671-0020 INTO THOSE PRODIGIOUS LEAGUES OF OCEAN WHICH LAY STRETCHED UNDER THE SKY WHILST THE HULL FLOATED SHE WAS SOMETHING TO HOLD ON TO SO TO SAY SOMETHING FOR THE EYE AMID THE VASTNESS OF WATER TO REST UPON
4853-27671-0021 AND HER MAIN DECK BLEW UP WITH A LOUD CLAP OR BLAST OF NOISE I COULD FOLLOW THE LINE OF HER BULWARKS FLUCTUATING AND WAVING IN THE CLEAR DARK BLUE WHEN SHE WAS SOME FEET UNDER
4853-27671-0022 AND WHICH SHE DRAGGED DOWN WITH HER ON A SUDDEN WHEN THE LAST FRAGMENT OF MAST HAD DISAPPEARED AND WHEN THE HOLLOWS OF THE WHIRLPOOLS WERE FLATTENING TO THE LEVEL SURFACE OF THE SEA UP ROSE A BODY WITH A SORT OF LEAP
4853-27671-0023 IT WAS THE SAILOR THAT HAD LAIN DROWNED ON THE STARBOARD SIDE OF THE FORWARD DECK BEING FROZEN STIFF HE ROSE IN THE POSTURE IN WHICH HE HAD EXPIRED THAT IS WITH HIS ARMS EXTENDED
4853-27671-0024 SO THAT WHEN HE JUMPED TO THE SURFACE HE CAME WITH HIS HANDS LIFTED UP TO HEAVEN AND THUS HE STAYED A MINUTE SUSTAINED BY THE EDDIES WHICH ALSO REVOLVED HIM THE SHOCK OCCASIONED BY THIS MELANCHOLY OBJECT WAS SO GREAT
4853-27671-0025 AND SUCH WAS THE STATE OF MY MIND THAT IMAGINATION MIGHT QUICKLY HAVE WORKED THE APPARITION HAD IT LINGERED INTO AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE UNSETTLING OF MY REASON I ROSE FROM THE SEAT ON TO WHICH I HAD SUNK AND LOOSED THE SAIL
4853-27671-0026 AND HAULING THE SHEET AFT PUT THE OAR OVER THE STERN AND BROUGHT THE LITTLE CRAFT'S HEAD TO AN EASTERLY COURSE THE DRAUGHT OF AIR WAS EXTREMELY WEAK AND SCARCE FURNISHED IMPULSE ENOUGH TO THE SAIL TO RAISE A BUBBLE ALONGSIDE
4853-27671-0027 THE BOAT WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN FEET LONG
4853-27671-0028 ERE I COULD HEAVE A CIVILIZED COAST OR A HABITABLE ISLAND INTO VIEW AT THE START I HAD A MIND TO STEER NORTH WEST AND BLOW AS THE WIND WOULD SUFFER INTO THE SOUTH SEA
4853-27671-0029 WHERE PERCHANCE I MIGHT MEET A WHALER OR A SOUTHSEAMAN FROM NEW HOLLAND BUT MY HEART SANK AT THE PROSPECT OF THE LEAGUES OF WATER WHICH ROLLED BETWEEN ME AND THE ISLANDS AND THE WESTERN AMERICAN SEABOARD INDEED
4853-27671-0030 I UNDERSTOOD THAT MY ONLY HOPE OF DELIVERANCE LAY IN BEING PICKED UP AND THAT THOUGH BY HEADING EAST I SHOULD BE CLINGING TO THE STORMY PARTS I WAS MORE LIKELY TO MEET WITH A SHIP HEREABOUTS
4853-27671-0031 THAN BY SAILING INTO THE GREAT DESOLATION OF THE NORTH WEST THE BURDEN OF MY LONELINESS WEIGHED DOWN UPON ME SO CRUSHINGLY THAT I CANNOT BUT CONSIDER MY SENSES MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT DULLED BY SUFFERING
4853-27671-0032 I AM PERSUADED MY HEART MUST HAVE BROKEN AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE DIED OF GRIEF FAINTLY AS THE WIND BLEW IT SPEEDILY WAFTED ME OUT OF SIGHT OF THE FLOATING RELICS OF THE WRECK
4853-27671-0033 AND THEN ALL WAS BARE BALD SWELLING SEA AND EMPEARLED SKY DARKENING IN LAGOONS OF AZURE DOWN TO THE SOFT MOUNTAINOUS MASSES OF WHITE VAPOUR LYING LIKE THE COAST OF A CONTINENT ON THE LARBOARD HORIZON
4853-27671-0034 BUT ONE LIVING THING THERE WAS BESIDES MYSELF A GREY BREASTED ALBATROSS OF A PRINCELY WIDTH OF PINION I HAD NOT OBSERVED IT TILL THE HULL WENT DOWN AND THEN
4853-27671-0035 LIFTING MY EYES WITH INVOLUNTARY SYMPATHY IN THE DIRECTION POINTED TO BY THE UPRAISED ARMS OF THE SAILOR I OBSERVED THE GREAT ROYAL BIRD HANGING LIKE A SHAPE OF MARBLE DIRECTLY OVER THE FROTHING EDDIES
4853-27671-0036 IT WAS AS THOUGH THE SPIRIT OF THE DEEP HAD TAKEN FORM IN THE SUBSTANCE OF THE NOBLEST OF ALL THE FOWLS OF ITS DOMINIONS AND POISED ON TREMORLESS WINGS
4853-27671-0037 WAS SURVEYING WITH THE COLD CURIOSITY OF AN INTELLIGENCE EMPTY OF HUMAN EMOTION THE DESTRUCTION OF ONE OF THOSE FABRICS WHOSE UNEQUAL CONTESTS AND REPEATED TRIUMPHS HAD PROVOKED ITS HAUGHTY SURPRISE
4853-27671-0038 THE BIRD QUITTED THE SPOT OF THE WRECK AFTER A WHILE AND FOLLOWED ME ITS EYES HAD THE SPARKLING BLOOD RED GLEAM OF RUBIES
4853-27671-0039 IT WAS AS SILENT AS A PHANTOM AND WITH ARCHED NECK AND MOTIONLESS PLUMES SEEMED TO WATCH ME WITH AN EARNESTNESS THAT PRESENTLY GREW INSUFFERABLE SO FAR FROM FINDING ANY COMFORT OF COMPANIONSHIP IN THE CREATURE
4853-27671-0040 IT UTTERED A STRANGE SALT CRY THE VERY NOTE OF A GUST OF WIND SPLITTING UPON A ROPE FLAPPED ITS WINGS AND AFTER A TURN OR TWO
4853-29413-0000 GLOODY SETTLES THE ACCOUNT A NIGHT OF FEVER A NIGHT WHEN I DID SLUMBER FOR A FEW MINUTES OF HORRID DREAMS THIS WAS WHAT I MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED AND THIS IS WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
4853-29413-0001 THE FRESH MORNING AIR FLOWING THROUGH MY OPEN WINDOW COOLED AND COMPOSED ME THE MERCY OF SLEEP FOUND ME WHEN I WOKE AND LOOKED AT MY WATCH I WAS A NEW MAN THE HOUR WAS NOON I RANG MY BELL
4853-29413-0002 THE SERVANT ANNOUNCED THAT A MAN WAS WAITING TO SEE ME THE SAME MAN SIR WHO WAS FOUND IN THE GARDEN LOOKING AT YOUR FLOWERS I AT ONCE GAVE DIRECTIONS TO HAVE HIM SHOWN UP INTO MY BEDROOM
4853-29413-0003 THE DELAY OF DRESSING WAS MORE THAN I HAD PATIENCE TO ENCOUNTER UNLESS I WAS COMPLETELY MISTAKEN HERE WAS THE VERY PERSON WHOM I WANTED TO ENLIGHTEN ME GLOODY SHOWED HIMSELF AT THE DOOR
4853-29413-0004 WITH A FACE OMINOUSLY WRETCHED AS WELL AS UGLY I INSTANTLY THOUGHT OF CRISTEL IF YOU BRING ME BAD NEWS I SAID DON'T KEEP ME WAITING FOR IT IT'S NOTHING THAT NEED TROUBLE YOU SIR
4853-29413-0005 I'M DISMISSED FROM MY MASTER'S SERVICE THAT'S ALL IT WAS PLAINLY NOT ALL RELIEVED EVEN BY THAT GUARDED REPLY I POINTED TO A CHAIR BY THE BEDSIDE DO YOU BELIEVE THAT I MEAN WELL BY YOU I ASKED
4853-29413-0006 WHAT DID HE DO FLEW INTO A FURIOUS RAGE I DON'T COMPLAIN OF THAT I DARESAY I DESERVED IT PLEASE TO EXCUSE MY GETTING UP AGAIN I CAN'T LOOK YOU IN THE FACE AND TELL YOU OF IT HE WALKED AWAY TO THE WINDOW
4853-29413-0007 EVEN A POOR DEVIL LIKE ME DOES SOMETIMES FEEL IT WHEN HE IS INSULTED MISTER ROYLAKE HE KICKED ME SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT SIR I WOULD NEVER HAVE MENTIONED IT IF I HADN'T HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO TELL YOU ONLY I DON'T KNOW HOW
4853-29413-0008 IN THIS DIFFICULTY HE CAME BACK TO MY BEDSIDE LOOK HERE SIR WHAT I SAY IS THAT KICK HAS WIPED OUT THE DEBT OF THANKS I OWE HIM YES I SAY THE ACCOUNT BETWEEN US TWO IS SETTLED NOW ON BOTH SIDES
4853-29413-0009 WHAT HIS MASTER HAD NO DOUBT INFERRED WAS WHAT I SAW PLAINLY TOO CRISTEL HAD SAVED MY LIFE AND HAD BEEN DIRECTED HOW TO DO IT BY THE POOR FELLOW WHO HAD SUFFERED IN MY CAUSE
4853-29413-0010 WE WILL WAIT A LITTLE BEFORE WE TALK OF SETTING THE LAW IN FORCE I SAID IN THE MEANTIME GLOODY I WANT YOU TO TELL ME WHAT YOU WOULD TELL THE MAGISTRATE IF I CALLED YOU AS A WITNESS HE CONSIDERED A LITTLE
4853-29413-0011 THE MAGISTRATE WOULD PUT QUESTIONS TO ME WOULDN'T HE SIR VERY GOOD YOU PUT QUESTIONS TO ME AND I'LL ANSWER THEM TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY
4853-29413-0012 THE INVESTIGATION THAT FOLLOWED WAS FAR TOO LONG AND TOO WEARISOME TO BE RELATED HERE IF I GIVE THE SUBSTANCE OF IT I SHALL HAVE DONE ENOUGH SOMETIMES WHEN HE WAS AWAKE AND SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS ALONE SOMETIMES WHEN HE WAS ASLEEP AND DREAMING
4853-29413-0013 THE CUR HAD BETRAYED HIMSELF IT WAS A PALTRY VENGEANCE I OWN TO GRATIFY A MALICIOUS PLEASURE AS I DID NOW IN THINKING OF HIM AND SPEAKING OF HIM BY THE DEGRADING NAME WHICH HIS MORBID HUMILITY HAD SUGGESTED
4853-29413-0014 TO GIVE HIM SOME IDEA OF THE JEALOUS HATRED WITH WHICH THE CUR REGARDED ME HE HAD DONE HIS BEST TO WARN ME WITHOUT ACTUALLY BETRAYING THE MAN WHO HAD RESCUED HIM FROM STARVATION OR THE WORKHOUSE AND HE HAD FAILED
4853-29413-0015 BUT HIS RESOLUTION TO DO ME GOOD SERVICE IN RETURN FOR MY KINDNESS TO HIM FAR FROM BEING SHAKEN WAS CONFIRMED BY CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN HIS MASTER RETURNED TO THE CHEMICAL STUDIES WHICH HAVE BEEN ALREADY MENTIONED
4853-29413-0016 GLOODY WAS EMPLOYED AS ASSISTANT TO THE EXTENT OF HIS LIMITED CAPACITY FOR MAKING HIMSELF USEFUL HE HAD NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT I WAS THE OBJECT OF ANY OF THE EXPERIMENTS UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE THE TEA PARTY
4853-29413-0017 A LAPSE OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR FOLLOWED THE LAST DOSE WAS REPEATED AND THE DOG SOON SPRANG TO HIS FEET AGAIN AS LIVELY AS EVER GLOODY WAS THEREUPON TOLD TO SET THE ANIMAL FREE AND WAS INFORMED AT THE SAME TIME
4853-29413-0018 THAT HE WOULD BE INSTANTLY DISMISSED IF HE MENTIONED TO ANY LIVING CREATURE WHAT HE HAD JUST SEEN BY WHAT PROCESS HE ARRIVED AT THE SUSPICION THAT MY SAFETY MIGHT BE THREATENED BY THE EXPERIMENT ON THE DOG HE WAS ENTIRELY UNABLE TO EXPLAIN
4853-29413-0019 IT WAS BORNE IN ON MY MIND SIR AND THAT'S ALL I CAN TELL YOU HE SAID I DIDN'T DARE SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT IT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED ME OR IF YOU DID BELIEVE ME YOU MIGHT HAVE SENT FOR THE POLICE
4853-29413-0020 THE ONE WAY OF PUTTING A STOP TO MURDERING MISCHIEF IF MURDERING MISCHIEF IT MIGHT BE WAS TO TRUST MISS CRISTEL THAT SHE WAS FOND OF YOU I DON'T MEAN ANY OFFENCE SIR I PRETTY WELL GUESSED
4853-29413-0021 THAT SHE WAS TRUE AS STEEL AND NOT EASILY FRIGHTENED I DIDN'T NEED TO GUESS I KNEW IT GLOODY HAD DONE HIS BEST TO PREPARE CRISTEL FOR THE TERRIBLE CONFIDENCE WHICH HE HAD DETERMINED TO REPOSE IN HER AND HAD NOT SUCCEEDED
4853-29413-0022 SHE WAS PLEDGED TO SECRECY UNDER PENALTY OF RUINING THE MAN WHO WAS TRYING TO SAVE ME AND TO HER PRESENCE OF MIND WAS TRUSTED THE WHOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF PRESERVING MY LIFE WHAT A SITUATION FOR A GIRL OF EIGHTEEN
4853-29413-0023 WHATEVER SHE SAW HIM DRINK SHE WAS TO INSIST ON YOUR DRINKING IT TOO YOU HEARD ME ASK LEAVE TO MAKE THE TEA YES WELL THAT WAS ONE OF THE SIGNALS AGREED ON BETWEEN US
4853-29413-0024 HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT HE WOULD NOT DRINK THE WHOLE CONTENTS OF THE JUG YOU FORGET SIR THAT I HAD SEEN THE DOG REVIVED BY TWO DOSES GIVEN WITH A SPACE OF TIME BETWEEN THEM
4853-29413-0025 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THIS AFTER WHAT HE HAD ALREADY TOLD ME MY INTELLIGENCE BRIGHTENED A LITTLE AS I WENT ON AND YOUR ACCIDENT IN THE NEXT ROOM WAS PLANNED OF COURSE I SAID
4853-29413-0026 I SHOULD SAY NO JUDGING BY HIS LOOKS HE TURNED PALE WHEN HE FELT THE FLOOR SHAKEN BY YOUR FALL FOR ONCE IN A WAY HE WAS HONEST HONESTLY FRIGHTENED I NOTICED THE SAME THING SIR WHEN HE PICKED ME UP OFF THE FLOOR
4853-29413-0027 A MAN WHO CAN CHANGE HIS COMPLEXION AT WILL IS A MAN WE HAV'N'T HEARD OF YET MISTER ROYLAKE I HAD BEEN DRESSING FOR SOME TIME PAST LONGING TO SEE CRISTEL IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY
4853-29413-0028 IS THERE ANYTHING MORE I ASKED THAT I OUGHT TO KNOW ONLY ONE THING MISTER ROYLAKE THAT I CAN THINK OF GLOODY REPLIED I'M AFRAID IT'S MISS CRISTEL'S TURN NEXT WHAT DO YOU MEAN
4853-29413-0029 WHILE THE DEAF MAN LODGES AT THE COTTAGE HE MEANS MISCHIEF AND HIS EYE IS ON MISS CRISTEL EARLY THIS MORNING SIR I HAPPENED TO BE AT THE BOAT HOUSE SOMEBODY I LEAVE YOU TO GUESS WHO IT IS HAS STOLEN THE OARS
4853-29413-0030 I WAS DRESSED BY THIS TIME AND SO EAGER TO GET TO THE COTTAGE THAT I HAD ALREADY OPENED MY DOOR WHAT I HAD JUST HEARD BROUGHT ME BACK INTO THE ROOM AS A MATTER OF COURSE WE BOTH SUSPECTED THE SAME PERSON OF STEALING THE OARS
4853-29413-0031 HAD WE ANY PROOF TO JUSTIFY US GLOODY AT ONCE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WE HAD NO PROOF I HAPPENED TO LOOK AT THE BOAT HE SAID AND I MISSED THE OARS OH YES I SEARCHED THE BOAT HOUSE NO OARS NO OARS
4853-29413-0032 AND NOTHING MORE THAT YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN AND OUGHT TO TELL ME NOTHING SIR
4898-20016-0000 HASTENING TO BEGIN HIS WORK THE TOWN IS AN OLD FASHIONED ONE AND ALTHOUGH THE OBSERVANCE OF THE ANCIENT CHURCH FESTIVAL IS NO LONGER FROWNED UPON AS IN YEARS PAST YET IT HAS BEEN LITTLE REGARDED
4898-20016-0001 ESPECIALLY IN THE CHURCH OF WHICH NATHAN IS A MEMBER AS THE SADDLER MOUNTED THE STEPS OF HIS SHOP HE FELT THE BLOOD SO RUSH ALONG HIS LIMBS AND TINGLE IN HIS FINGERS
4898-20016-0002 THAT HE COULD NOT FORBEAR STANDING WITHOUT THE DOOR FOR A MOMENT AS IF TO ENJOY THE TRIUMPH OF THE WARMTH WITHIN HIM OVER THE COLD MORNING AIR THE LITTLE STONE CHURCH
4898-20016-0003 WHICH NATHAN ATTENDS STANDS IN THE SAME SQUARE WITH HIS SHOP AND NEARLY OPPOSITE IT WAS CLOSED AS USUAL ON CHRISTMAS DAY AND A RECENT SNOW HAD HEAPED THE STEPS AND ROOF AND LOADED THE WINDOWS
4898-20016-0004 NATHAN THOUGHT THAT IT LOOKED UNCOMMONLY BEAUTIFUL IN THE SOFTENING TWILIGHT OF THE MORNING WHILE NATHAN STOOD MUSING WITH HIS EYES FIXED UPON THE CHURCH
4898-20016-0005 ALTHOUGH A GOOD DEAL STOOPING WITH LONG STRAIGHT AND VERY WHITE HAIR FALLING OVER HIS SHOULDERS WHICH WAS THE MORE CONSPICUOUS FROM THE BLACK VELVET CAP AS IT APPEARED THAT HE WORE
4898-20016-0006 AS TO WHO THE STRANGER COULD BE WHEN HE BEHELD HIM TURN IN BETWEEN THE POSTS BY THE PATH THAT LEADS TO THE CHURCH TREAD LIGHTLY OVER THE SNOW AND UP THE STEPS AND KNOCK HASTILY AND VIGOROUSLY AT THE CHURCH DOOR
4898-20016-0007 BUT HALF RECOVERED FROM HIS WONDER HE WAS JUST RAISING HIS VOICE TO UTTER A REMONSTRANCE WHEN TO HIS SEVENFOLD AMAZEMENT THE DOOR WAS OPENED TO THE KNOCK AND THE OLD MAN DISAPPEARED WITHIN
4898-20016-0008 IT WAS NOT WITHOUT A CREEPING FEELING OF AWE MINGLED WITH HIS ASTONISHMENT THAT NATHAN GAZED UPON THE DOOR THROUGH WHICH THIS SILENT FIGURE HAD VANISHED BUT HE WAS NOT EASILY TO BE DAUNTED
4898-20016-0009 HE DID NOT CARE TO FOLLOW THE STEPS OF THE STRANGER INTO THE CHURCH BUT HE REMEMBERED A SHED SO PLACED AGAINST THE BUILDING NEAR THE FARTHER END THAT HE HAD OFTEN WHEN A CHILD AT SOME PERIL INDEED CLIMBED UPON ITS TOP
4898-20016-0010 AND LOOKED INTO THE CHURCH THROUGH A LITTLE WINDOW AT ONE SIDE OF THE PULPIT FOR THIS HE STARTED BUT HE DID NOT FAIL TO RUN ACROSS THE SQUARE AND LEAP OVER THE CHURCH GATE AT THE TOP OF HIS SPEED
4898-20016-0011 IN ORDER TO GATHER WARMTH AND COURAGE FOR THE ATTEMPT WHEN NATHAN STODDARD CLIMBED UPON THE OLD SHED AND PRESSED HIS FACE AGAINST THE GLASS OF THE LITTLE CHURCH WINDOW HE HAD AT FIRST ONLY A CONFUSED IMPRESSION
4898-20016-0012 AS HE GLARED THROUGH THE DARKNESS INTO THE OLD KIRK OF ALLOWAY THE GREAT CHANDELIER OF THE CHURCH WAS PARTLY LIGHTED AND THERE WERE BESIDES MANY CANDLES AND LANTERNS BURNING IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ROOM
4898-20016-0013 WHO WERE DRESSED IN BREECHES AND RUFFLED SHIRTS AND HOOPED PETTICOATS AND TOWERING HEAD DRESSES SUCH AS HE HAD ONLY SEEN IN OLD PICTURES THEY WERE MOUNTED UPON BENCHES AND LADDERS
4898-20016-0014 AND BOARDS LAID ALONG THE TOPS OF THE PEWS AND WERE APPARENTLY JUST COMPLETING THE DECORATION OF THE CHURCH WHICH WAS ALREADY DRESSED WITH GREEN WITH LITTLE TREES IN THE CORNERS AND WITH GREEN LETTERS UPON THE WALLS
4898-20016-0015 THE WHOLE PARTY APPEARED FULL OF LIFE AND CHEERFULNESS WHILE THE OLD MAN WHOM NATHAN HAD SEEN ENTER STOOD NEAR THE DOOR LOOKING QUIETLY ON WITH A LITTLE GIRL HOLDING HIS HAND
4898-20016-0016 IT WAS NOT UNTIL NATHAN STODDARD HAD LOOKED FOR SOME LITTLE TIME UPON THIS SPECTACLE THAT HE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE WAS WITNESS OF ANY THING MORE THAN NATURAL THE WHOLE PARTY HAD SO HOME LIKE AN AIR
4898-20016-0017 THE MORE HE WAS FILLED FOR ALL THEIR APPEARANCE OF YOUTH AND THEIR SIMPLE MANNERS WITH A STRANGE SORT OF VENERATION THE SWEET AND CHEERFUL FACES OF THE YOUNG WOMEN SEEMED TO GROW AWFULLY CALM
4898-20016-0018 AND BEAUTIFUL AS THEY BROUGHT THEIR TASK TO A CLOSE AND THEIR FOREHEADS WITH THE HAIR BROUGHT BACK IN THE OLD FASHIONED WAY TO BECOME MORE AND MORE SERENE AND HIGH THERE WAS A STRANGE BEAUTY TOO
4898-20016-0019 ABOUT THE OLD MAN'S FACE HE APPEARED TO NATHAN AS IF HE FELT THAT THE GROUP BEFORE HIM ONLY WAITED HIS COMMAND TO FADE AWAY IN THE MORNING LIGHT THAT STRUGGLED AMONG THE CANDLES BUT HE COULD NOT BEAR TO GIVE THE WORD
4898-20016-0020 AND SO THEY KEPT PLAYING WITH THE FESTOONS AND STEPPING ABOUT THE PEWS TO PLEASE HIM NATHAN FELT A COLD THRILL PARTLY FROM PLEASURE AND PARTLY FROM AWE RUNNING UP HIS BACK AND A STRONG PAIN ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD
4898-20016-0021 UNTIL HE FELT THAT HE WAS NEAR SWOONING AND LIKE TO FALL AND HE CLUNG DESPERATELY TO HIS HOLD WHEN THE FIT WAS OVER HE DARED VENTURE NO MORE BUT HASTENED TO THE GROUND
4898-20016-0022 THAT LED NATHAN STODDARD TO KEEP SECRET WHAT HE HAD WITNESSED BUT IT WAS LIKE SOME DEEP AND HOLY EXPERIENCE
4898-20016-0023 SO HE WENT BACK TO HIS SHOP AND SAT LOOKING UPON THE CHURCH AND WATCHING ALMOST WITH DREAD THE DOVES THAT LIGHTED UPON ITS ROOF AND FLUTTERED ABOUT AND BEAT THEIR WINGS AGAINST ITS WINDOWS
4898-20016-0024 THE MINISTER OF NATHAN'S PARISH WAS A YOUNG MAN BY THE NAME OF DUDLEY AND IT SO HAPPENED THAT HE HAD DRIVEN OUT BEFORE LIGHT ON THE MORNING WE HAVE SPOKEN OF TO VISIT A SICK MAN AT SOME DISTANCE
4898-20016-0025 IN RETURNING HOME HE HAD TO PASS ALONG THE RATHER UNFREQUENTED STREET WHICH RUNS IN THE REAR OF HIS CHURCH AND CLOSE TO IT AS HE WAS DRIVING RAPIDLY ALONG HIS EAR CAUGHT WHAT SEEMED THE PEAL OF AN ORGAN
4898-20016-0026 HE STOPPED HIS HORSE TO LISTEN
4898-20016-0027 AND DROVE ROUND INTO THE SQUARE TO THE SHOP OF NATHAN STODDARD THERE IS MUSIC TO DAY IN OUR CHURCH NATHAN HE CRIED TO THE YOUNG SADDLER WHAT CAN IT MEAN BUT NATHAN ANSWERED NOT A WORD HE CAUGHT THE HORSE BY THE HEAD
4898-20016-0028 AND FASTENED HIM TO A POST BEFORE THE DOOR THEN STEPPING TO THE SIDE OF THE SLEIGH HE SAID TO MISTER DUDLEY COME WITH ME SIR MISTER DUDLEY LOOKED UPON THE PALE FACE AND TREMBLING LIPS OF HIS PARISHIONER
4898-20016-0029 AND FOLLOWED IN SILENCE NATHAN SPRANG UPON THE SHED AT THE SIDE OF THE CHURCH AND SCRAMBLED UP TO THE LITTLE WINDOW MISTER DUDLEY FOLLOWED AND WITH NATHAN'S HELP GAINED THE SAME PRECARIOUS FOOTHOLD LOOK IN SIR
4898-20016-0030 SAID NATHAN NOT VENTURING A GLANCE HIMSELF MISTER DUDLEY LOOKED AND HAD NOT NATHAN'S ARM BEEN ABOUT HIS BODY HE WOULD HAVE LOST HIS HOLD IN SHEER AMAZEMENT THE BUILDING WAS CROWDED AS HE HAD NEVER KNOWN IT BEFORE
4898-20016-0031 AND CROWDED WITH PEOPLE WHOM HIS EYE VERSED IN THE DRESS AND MANNERS OF OUR FOREFATHERS RECOGNIZED AS THE CHURCH GOERS OF A CENTURY AND A HALF AGO THE SINGERS GALLERY WAS FILLED BY A CHOIR OF GIRLS AND BOYS
4898-20016-0032 IT WAS SAID TO BE A PORTRAIT OF A MINISTER IN THE TOWN WHO LIVED IN THE LAST CENTURY AND IS STILL REMEMBERED FOR HIS VIRTUES THE SIGHT OF THIS OLD MAN'S FACE COMPLETELY STILLED THE AGITATION OF THE YOUNG MINISTER
4898-20016-0033 HE WAS LEANING OVER THE GREAT BIBLE WITH HIS HANDS FOLDED UPON IT AND HIS EYES SEEMINGLY FILLED WITH TEARS OF PLEASURE AND GRATITUDE AND BENT UPON THE CHOIR MISTER DUDLEY LISTENED INTENTLY
4898-20016-0034 BY THIS TIME THE SOUND OF A GATHERING CROWD BELOW WHICH HE HAD NOT HEEDED AT FIRST WAS FORCED MORE AND MORE UPON HIS NOTICE AND THE ANXIOUS VOICE OF HIS OLDEST DEACON CALLING MISTER DUDLEY MISTER DUDLEY
4898-20016-0035 ROSE HIGH AND LOUD WHILE A GREAT THUNDERING AT THE FRONT DOOR OF THE CHURCH ANNOUNCED THAT THE PEOPLE BELOW HAD ALSO CAUGHT THE SOUND OF THE MUSIC AND WERE CLAMOROUS FOR ADMISSION
4898-20016-0036 MISTER DUDLEY HASTENED ROUND TO PREVENT THEIR CAUSING ANY DISTURBANCE TO THE CONGREGATION WITHIN BUT HE CAME ONLY IN TIME TO SEE THE DOOR BURST OPEN AND TO BE BORNE IN WITH THE CROWD ALL GAZED ABOUT IN WONDER
4898-20016-0037 HAD BEEN FAIRLY DRESSED FOR CHRISTMAS BY SPIRIT HANDS WHEN MISTER DUDLEY REACHED HIS HOME AFTER THE WONDER HAD IN PART SPENT ITSELF HE FOUND THAT AN ENORMOUS CHRISTMAS PIE
4898-20016-0038 HAD BEEN LEFT AT HIS DOOR BY A WHITE HAIRED OLD MAN DRESSED IN BLACK ABOUT SIX IN THE MORNING JUST AFTER HE HAD GONE TO VISIT HIS SICK PARISHIONER THE GIRL WHO RECEIVED IT REPORTED THE OLD MAN AS SAYING
4898-20016-0039 IN A TREMULOUS BUT VERY KIND VOICE GIVE YOUR MASTER THE CHRISTMAS BLESSING OF AN OLD PURITAN MINISTER HOW THE MEANING OF THIS MESSAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO MISTER DUDLEY HAD NOT THE EVENTS WE HAVE TOLD DISCLOSED IT
4898-20016-0040 AND THAT HE AVOWS THE INTENTION OF OBSERVING THE CHRISTMAS OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR WITH PUBLIC SERVICES UNLESS INDEED HE SHOULD BE ANTICIPATED BY HIS ANCIENT PREDECESSOR
4898-28461-0000 THE MOST INTERESTING OF THE SHORT EXCURSIONS WE MADE FROM FORT WRANGELL WAS THE ONE UP THE STICKEEN RIVER TO THE HEAD OF STEAM NAVIGATION FROM MT SAINT ELIAS THE COAST RANGE EXTENDS IN A BROAD LOFTY CHAIN
4898-28461-0001 BEYOND THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE TERRITORY GASHED BY STUPENDOUS CANYONS
4898-28461-0002 THOUGH MOST OF THEM ARE COMPARATIVELY SHORT AS THEIR HIGHEST SOURCES LIE IN THE ICY SOLITUDES OF THE RANGE WITHIN FORTY OR FIFTY MILES OF THE COAST A FEW HOWEVER OF THESE FOAMING ROARING STREAMS
4898-28461-0003 TAKU STICKEEN AND PERHAPS OTHERS HEAD BEYOND THE RANGE WITH SOME OF THE SOUTHWEST BRANCHES OF THE MACKENZIE AND YUKON THE LARGEST SIDE BRANCHES
4898-28461-0004 ARE STILL OCCUPIED BY GLACIERS WHICH DESCEND IN SHOWY RANKS THEIR MESSY BULGING SNOUTS LYING BACK A LITTLE DISTANCE IN THE SHADOWS OF THE WALLS OR PUSHING FORWARD AMONG THE COTTON WOODS
4898-28461-0005 THAT LINE THE BANKS OF THE RIVERS OR EVEN STRETCHING ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE MAIN CANYONS COMPELLING THE RIVERS TO FIND A CHANNEL BENEATH THEM THE STICKEEN WAS PERHAPS THE BEST KNOWN OF THE RIVERS THAT CROSS THE COAST RANGE
4898-28461-0006 BECAUSE IT WAS THE BEST WAY TO THE MACKENZIE RIVER CASSIAR GOLD MINES IT IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES LONG AND IS NAVIGABLE FOR SMALL STEAMERS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES TO GLENORA
4898-28461-0007 AND SOMETIMES TO TELEGRAPH CREEK FIFTEEN MILES FARTHER IT FIRST PURSUES A WESTERLY COURSE THROUGH GRASSY PLAINS DARKENED HERE AND THERE WITH GROVES OF SPRUCE AND PINE
4898-28461-0008 THEN CURVING SOUTHWARD AND RECEIVING NUMEROUS TRIBUTARIES FROM THE NORTH IT ENTERS THE COAST RANGE AND SWEEPS ACROSS IT THROUGH A MAGNIFICENT CANYON THREE THOUSAND TO FIVE THOUSAND FEET DEEP
4898-28461-0009 OF FORM AND SCULPTURE AND ARE WONDERFULLY ADORNED AND ENLIVENED WITH GLACIERS AND WATERFALLS WHILE THROUGHOUT ALMOST ITS WHOLE EXTENT THE FLOOR IS A FLOWERY LANDSCAPE GARDEN LIKE YOSEMITE
4898-28461-0010 THE MOST STRIKING FEATURES ARE THE GLACIERS HANGING OVER THE CLIFFS DESCENDING THE SIDE CANYONS AND PUSHING FORWARD TO THE RIVER GREATLY ENHANCING THE WILD BEAUTY OF ALL THE OTHERS
4898-28461-0011 GLIDING ALONG THE SWIFT FLOWING RIVER THE VIEWS CHANGE WITH BEWILDERING RAPIDITY WONDERFUL TOO ARE THE CHANGES DEPENDENT ON THE SEASONS AND THE WEATHER IN SPRING WHEN THE SNOW IS MELTING FAST
4898-28461-0012 YOU ENJOY THE COUNTLESS REJOICING WATERFALLS THE GENTLE BREATHING OF WARM WINDS THE COLORS OF THE YOUNG LEAVES AND FLOWERS WHEN THE BEES ARE BUSY AND WAFTS OF FRAGRANCE ARE DRIFTING HITHER AND THITHER
4898-28461-0013 FROM MILES OF WILD ROSES CLOVER AND HONEYSUCKLE THE SWATHS OF BIRCH AND WILLOW ON THE LOWER SLOPES FOLLOWING THE MELTING OF THE WINTER AVALANCHE SNOW BANKS
4898-28461-0014 THE BOSSY CUMULI SWELLING IN WHITE AND PURPLE PILES ABOVE THE HIGHEST PEAKS GRAY RAIN CLOUDS WREATHING THE OUTSTANDING BROWS AND BATTLEMENTS OF THE WALLS
4898-28461-0015 AND THE BREAKING FORTH OF THE SUN AFTER THE RAIN THE SHINING OF THE LEAVES AND STREAMS AND CRYSTAL ARCHITECTURE OF THE GLACIERS THE RISING OF FRESH FRAGRANCE THE SONG OF THE HAPPY BIRDS
4898-28461-0016 AND THE SERENE COLOR GRANDEUR OF THE MORNING AND EVENING SKY IN SUMMER YOU FIND THE GROVES AND GARDENS IN FULL DRESS GLACIERS MELTING RAPIDLY UNDER SUNSHINE AND RAIN WATERFALLS IN ALL THEIR GLORY
4898-28461-0017 THE RIVER REJOICING IN ITS STRENGTH YOUNG BIRDS TRYING THEIR WINGS BEARS ENJOYING SALMON AND BERRIES ALL THE LIFE OF THE CANYON BRIMMING FULL LIKE THE STREAMS IN AUTUMN COMES REST AS IF THE YEAR'S WORK WERE DONE
4898-28461-0018 THE RICH HAZY SUNSHINE STREAMING OVER THE CLIFFS CALLS FORTH THE LAST OF THE GENTIANS AND GOLDENRODS THE GROVES AND THICKETS AND MEADOWS BLOOM AGAIN AS THEIR LEAVES CHANGE TO RED AND YELLOW PETALS
4898-28461-0019 THE ROCKS ALSO AND THE GLACIERS SEEM TO BLOOM LIKE THE PLANTS IN THE MELLOW GOLDEN LIGHT AND SO GOES THE SONG CHANGE SUCCEEDING CHANGE IN SUBLIME HARMONY THROUGH ALL THE WONDERFUL SEASONS AND WEATHER
4898-28461-0020 MY FIRST TRIP UP THE RIVER WAS MADE IN THE SPRING WITH THE MISSIONARY PARTY SOON AFTER OUR ARRIVAL AT WRANGELL WE LEFT WRANGELL IN THE AFTERNOON AND ANCHORED FOR THE NIGHT ABOVE THE RIVER DELTA
4898-28461-0021 WE ARRIVED BEFORE NOON AT THE OLD TRADING POST CALLED BUCK'S IN FRONT OF THE STICKEEN GLACIER AND REMAINED LONG ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE FEW PASSENGERS WHO WISHED A NEARER VIEW TO CROSS THE RIVER TO THE TERMINAL MORAINE
4898-28461-0022 THE SUNBEAMS STREAMING THROUGH THE ICE PINNACLES ALONG ITS TERMINAL WALL PRODUCED A WONDERFUL GLORY OF COLOR AND THE BROAD SPARKLING CRYSTAL PRAIRIE AND THE DISTANT SNOWY FOUNTAINS WERE WONDERFULLY ATTRACTIVE
4898-28461-0023 AND EXPANDS IN A BROAD FAN FIVE OR SIX MILES IN WIDTH SEPARATED FROM THE STICKEEN RIVER BY ITS BROAD TERMINAL MORAINE FRINGED WITH SPRUCES AND WILLOWS AROUND THE BEAUTIFULLY DRAWN CURVE OF THE MORAINE
4898-28461-0024 WAS ONCE UNITED FRONT TO FRONT WITH THE GREATER GLACIER THOUGH AT FIRST BOTH WERE TRIBUTARIES OF THE MAIN STICKEEN GLACIER WHICH ONCE FILLED THE WHOLE GRAND CANYON AFTER THE MAIN TRUNK CANYON WAS MELTED OUT
4898-28461-0025 CIRQUES AND BRANCH CANYONS ALONG THE TOPS AND SIDES OF THE WALLS THE INDIANS HAVE A TRADITION THAT THE RIVER USED TO RUN THROUGH A TUNNEL UNDER THE UNITED FRONTS OF THE TWO LARGE TRIBUTARY GLACIERS MENTIONED ABOVE
4898-28461-0026 WHICH ENTERED THE MAIN CANYON FROM EITHER SIDE AND THAT ON ONE OCCASION AN INDIAN ANXIOUS TO GET RID OF HIS WIFE HAD HER SENT ADRIFT IN A CANOE DOWN THROUGH THE ICE TUNNEL EXPECTING THAT SHE WOULD TROUBLE HIM NO MORE
4898-28461-0027 BUT TO HIS SURPRISE SHE FLOATED THROUGH UNDER THE ICE IN SAFETY ALL THE EVIDENCE CONNECTED WITH THE PRESENT APPEARANCE OF THESE TWO GLACIERS INDICATES THAT THEY WERE UNITED AND FORMED A DAM ACROSS THE RIVER
4898-28461-0028 AND HAD RECEDED TO A GREATER OR LESSER HEIGHT ABOVE THE VALLEY FLOOR THE BIG STICKEEN GLACIER IS HARDLY OUT OF SIGHT ERE YOU COME UPON ANOTHER THAT POURS A MAJESTIC CRYSTAL FLOOD
4898-28461-0029 THROUGH THE EVERGREENS WHILE ALMOST EVERY HOLLOW AND TRIBUTARY CANYON CONTAINS A SMALLER ONE THE SIZE OF COURSE VARYING WITH THE EXTENT OF THE AREA DRAINED SOME ARE LIKE MERE SNOW BANKS OTHERS WITH THE BLUE ICE APPARENT
4898-28461-0030 DEPEND IN MASSIVE BULGING CURVES AND SWELLS AND GRADUATE INTO THE RIVER LIKE FORMS THAT MAZE THROUGH THE LOWER FORESTED REGIONS AND ARE SO STRIKING AND BEAUTIFUL THAT THEY ARE ADMIRED EVEN BY THE PASSING MINERS
4898-28461-0031 WITH GOLD DUST IN THEIR EYES THIRTY FIVE MILES ABOVE THE BIG STICKEEN GLACIER IS THE DIRT GLACIER THE SECOND IN SIZE ITS OUTLET IS A FINE STREAM ABOUNDING IN TROUT
4898-28461-0032 ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE RIVER THERE IS A GROUP OF FIVE GLACIERS ONE OF THEM DESCENDING TO WITHIN A HUNDRED FEET OF THE RIVER NEAR GLENORA ON THE NORTHEASTERN FLANK OF THE MAIN COAST RANGE
4898-28461-0033 JUST BELOW A NARROW GORGE CALLED THE CANYON TERRACES FIRST MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE WHERE GREAT QUANTITIES OF MORAINE MATERIAL HAVE BEEN SWEPT THROUGH THE FLOOD CHOKED GORGE AND OF COURSE OUTSPREAD
4898-28461-0034 AND DEPOSITED ON THE FIRST OPEN LEVELS BELOW HERE TOO OCCURS A MARKED CHANGE IN CLIMATE AND CONSEQUENTLY IN FORESTS AND GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THE FACE OF THE COUNTRY ON ACCOUNT OF DESTRUCTIVE FIRES THE WOODS ARE YOUNGER
4898-28461-0035 AND ARE COMPOSED OF SMALLER TREES ABOUT A FOOT TO EIGHTEEN INCHES IN DIAMETER AND SEVENTY FIVE FEET HIGH MOSTLY TWO LEAVED PINES WHICH HOLD THEIR SEEDS FOR SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THEY ARE RIPE THE WOODS HERE ARE WITHOUT A TRACE
4898-28461-0036 OF THOSE DEEP ACCUMULATIONS OF MOSSES LEAVES AND DECAYING TRUNKS WHICH MAKE SO DAMP AND UNCLEARABLE MASS IN THE COAST FORESTS
4898-28461-0037 WHERE THE FOREST HAS BEEN UTTERLY DESTROYED THE RIVER BANK COTTONWOODS ARE ALSO SMALLER AND THE BIRCH AND CONTORTA PINES MINGLE FREELY WITH THE COAST HEMLOCK AND SPRUCE THE BIRCH IS COMMON ON THE LOWER SLOPES
4898-28461-0038 AND IS VERY EFFECTIVE ITS ROUND LEAFY PALE GREEN HEAD CONTRASTING WITH THE DARK NARROW SPIRES OF THE CONIFERS AND GIVING A STRIKING CHARACTER TO THE FOREST THE TAMARAC PINE OR BLACK PINE AS THE VARIETY OF
4898-28461-0039 WHERE IT HAS ESCAPED FIRE AND SNOW AVALANCHES THERE IS ANOTHER HANDSOME SPRUCE HEREABOUTS PICEA ALBA VERY SLENDER AND GRACEFUL IN HABIT DROOPING AT THE TOP LIKE A MOUNTAIN HEMLOCK
4898-28461-0040 I SAW FINE SPECIMENS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE FEET HIGH ON DEEP BOTTOM LAND A FEW MILES BELOW GLENORA THE TOPS OF SOME OF THEM WERE ALMOST COVERED WITH DENSE CLUSTERS OF YELLOW AND BROWN CONES
4898-28461-0041 WE REACHED THE OLD HUDSON'S BAY TRADING POST AT GLENORA ABOUT ONE O'CLOCK AND THE CAPTAIN INFORMED ME THAT HE WOULD STOP HERE UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING WHEN HE WOULD MAKE AN EARLY START FOR WRANGELL
4898-28461-0042 AT A DISTANCE OF ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT MILES TO THE NORTHEASTWARD OF THE LANDING THERE IS AN OUTSTANDING GROUP OF MOUNTAINS CROWNING A SPUR FROM THE MAIN CHAIN OF THE COAST RANGE WHOSE HIGHEST POINT RISES ABOUT
4898-28461-0043 EIGHT THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA AND AS GLENORA IS ONLY A THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA
4898-28461-0044 BECAUSE OF THE ADVANTAGEOUS POSITION IT OCCUPIED FOR GENERAL VIEWS OF THE PEAKS AND GLACIERS OF THE EAST SIDE OF THE GREAT RANGE ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOW TWENTY MINUTES PAST THREE AND THE DAYS WERE GETTING SHORT
4898-28461-0045 I THOUGHT THAT BY RAPID CLIMBING I COULD REACH THE SUMMIT BEFORE SUNSET IN TIME TO GET A GENERAL VIEW AND A FEW PENCIL SKETCHES AND MAKE MY WAY BACK TO THE STEAMER IN THE NIGHT MISTER YOUNG ONE OF THE MISSIONARIES ASKED PERMISSION TO ACCOMPANY ME
4898-28461-0046 A FAIR DAY'S WORK FOR A SEASONED MOUNTAINEER TO BE DONE IN LESS THAN HALF A DAY AND PART OF A NIGHT BUT HE INSISTED THAT HE WAS A STRONG WALKER COULD DO A MOUNTAINEER'S DAY'S WORK IN HALF A DAY AND WOULD NOT HINDER ME IN ANY WAY
4898-28461-0047 WELL I HAVE WARNED YOU I SAID AND WILL NOT ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY TROUBLE THAT MAY ARISE HE PROVED TO BE A STOUT WALKER AND WE MADE RAPID PROGRESS ACROSS A BRUSHY TIMBERED FLAT
4898-28461-0048 AND UP THE MOUNTAIN SLOPES OPEN IN SOME PLACES AND IN OTHERS THATCHED WITH DWARF FIRS RESTING A MINUTE HERE AND THERE TO REFRESH OURSELVES WITH HUCKLEBERRIES WHICH GREW IN ABUNDANCE IN OPEN SPOTS ABOUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE SUNSET
4898-28461-0049 WHEN WE WERE NEAR A CLUSTER OF CRUMBLING PINNACLES THAT FORMED THE SUMMIT I HAD CEASED TO FEEL ANXIETY ABOUT THE MOUNTAINEERING STRENGTH AND SKILL OF MY COMPANION AND PUSHED RAPIDLY ON IN PASSING AROUND THE SHOULDER OF THE HIGHEST PINNACLE
4898-28461-0050 WHERE THE ROCK WAS RAPIDLY DISINTEGRATING AND THE DANGER OF SLIPPING WAS GREAT I SHOUTED IN A WARNING VOICE BE VERY CAREFUL HERE THIS IS DANGEROUS MISTER YOUNG WAS PERHAPS A DOZEN OR TWO YARDS BEHIND ME BUT OUT OF SIGHT
4898-28461-0051 I FOUND HOWEVER THAT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE IN SUCH A PLACE I THEREFORE TIED HIS ARMS TO HIS SIDES WITH MY SUSPENDERS AND NECKTIE TO PREVENT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE INFLAMMATION FROM MOVEMENT I THEN LEFT HIM TELLING HIM TO LIE STILL
4898-28461-0052 TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS NOT INTERRUPTED BY SHEER PRECIPICES I CONCLUDED THAT WITH GREAT CARE AND THE DIGGING OF SLIGHT FOOTHOLDS HE COULD BE SLID DOWN TO THE GLACIER WHERE I COULD LAY HIM ON HIS BACK AND PERHAPS BE ABLE TO SET HIS ARMS
4898-28461-0053 I REACHED UP TOOK HOLD OF HIM BY ONE OF HIS FEET AND GENTLY SLID HIM DOWN ON HIS BACK
4898-28461-0054 DUG HEEL NOTCHES AND SLID HIM DOWN TO THEM
4898-28461-0055 AND THE GLACIER WAS REACHED PERHAPS ABOUT MIDNIGHT HERE I TOOK OFF ONE OF MY BOOTS TIED A HANDKERCHIEF AROUND HIS WRIST FOR A GOOD HOLD
4898-28461-0056 AND SUCCEEDED IN GETTING ONE OF HIS ARMS INTO PLACE
4898-28461-0057 I THEREFORE BOUND IT CLOSELY TO HIS SIDE AND ASKED HIM IF IN HIS EXHAUSTED AND TREMBLING CONDITION HE WAS STILL ABLE TO WALK YES HE BRAVELY REPLIED SO WITH A STEADYING ARM AROUND HIM AND MANY STOPS FOR REST
4898-28461-0058 I MARCHED HIM SLOWLY DOWN IN THE STARLIGHT ON THE COMPARATIVELY SMOOTH
4898-28461-0059 A DISTANCE OF PERHAPS A MILE CROSSED THE MORAINE BATHED HIS HEAD AT ONE OF THE OUTLET STREAMS AND AFTER MANY RESTS REACHED A DRY PLACE AND MADE A BRUSH FIRE I THEN WENT AHEAD LOOKING FOR AN OPEN WAY
4898-28461-0060 AND A LEAFY BED BESIDE IT I NOW TOLD HIM I WOULD RUN DOWN THE MOUNTAIN HASTEN BACK WITH HELP FROM THE BOAT AND CARRY HIM DOWN IN COMFORT BUT HE WOULD NOT HEAR OF MY LEAVING HIM NO NO HE SAID I CAN WALK DOWN DON'T LEAVE ME
4898-28461-0061 I REMINDED HIM OF THE ROUGHNESS OF THE WAY HIS NERVE SHAKEN CONDITION AND ASSURED HIM I WOULD NOT BE GONE LONG BUT HE INSISTED ON TRYING
4898-28461-0062 AND MADE HIM LEAN ON MY SHOULDER WHILE I STEADIED HIM TO PREVENT HIS FALLING THIS SLOW STAGGERING STRUGGLE FROM FIRE TO FIRE LASTED UNTIL LONG AFTER SUNRISE WHEN AT LAST WE REACHED THE SHIP AND STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE NARROW SINGLE PLANK
4898-28461-0063 AT A CONSIDERABLE ANGLE I BRIEFLY EXPLAINED TO MISTER YOUNG'S COMPANIONS WHO STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT US THAT HE HAD BEEN HURT IN AN ACCIDENT AND REQUESTED ONE OF THEM TO ASSIST ME IN GETTING HIM ABOARD BUT STRANGE TO SAY INSTEAD OF COMING DOWN TO HELP
4898-28461-0064 THEY MADE HASTE TO REPROACH HIM FOR HAVING GONE ON A WILD GOOSE CHASE WITH MUIR THESE FOOLISH ADVENTURES ARE WELL ENOUGH FOR MISTER MUIR THEY SAID BUT YOU MISTER YOUNG HAVE A WORK TO DO YOU HAVE A FAMILY YOU HAVE A CHURCH
4898-28461-0065 AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO RISK YOUR LIFE ON TREACHEROUS PEAKS AND PRECIPICES
4898-28461-0066 HAD BEEN SWEARING IN ANGRY IMPATIENCE FOR BEING COMPELLED TO MAKE SO LATE A START AND THUS ENCOUNTER A DANGEROUS WIND IN A NARROW GORGE AND WAS THREATENING TO PUT THE MISSIONARIES ASHORE TO SEEK THEIR LOST COMPANION
4898-28461-0067 WHILE HE WENT ON DOWN THE RIVER ABOUT HIS BUSINESS BUT WHEN HE HEARD MY CALL FOR HELP HE HASTENED FORWARD AND ELBOWED THE DIVINES AWAY FROM THE END OF THE GANGPLANK SHOUTING IN ANGRY IRREVERENCE OH BLANK THIS IS NO TIME FOR PREACHING
4898-28461-0068 THEN WITH A MAN HOLDING DOWN HIS SHOULDERS WE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THE BONE INTO ITS SOCKET NOTWITHSTANDING THE INFLAMMATION AND CONTRACTION OF THE MUSCLES AND LIGAMENTS MISTER YOUNG WAS THEN PUT TO BED AND HE SLEPT ALL THE WAY BACK TO WRANGELL
5022-29405-0000 TIME HAS PASSED SINCE I FIRST READ IT AND CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED IN THE INTERVAL WHICH LEAVE ME FREE TO EXERCISE MY OWN DISCRETION AND TO LET THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY SPEAK FOR ITSELF IF I AM ASKED WHAT IMPRESSION OF THE WRITER THOSE EXTRAORDINARY PAGES PRODUCED ON ME
5022-29405-0001 I FEEL AT A LOSS HOW TO REPLY NOT ONE IMPRESSION BUT MANY IMPRESSIONS TROUBLED AND CONFUSED MY MIND CERTAIN PASSAGES IN THE CONFESSION INCLINED ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE WRITER WAS MAD BUT I ALTERED MY OPINION AT THE NEXT LEAF
5022-29405-0002 AND SET HIM DOWN AS A MAN WITH A BITTER HUMOR
5022-29405-0003 AT ONE TIME HIS TONE IN WRITING OF HIS EARLY LIFE AND HIS ALLUSIONS TO HIS MOTHER WON MY SYMPATHY AND RESPECT AT ANOTHER TIME THE PICTURE OF HIMSELF IN HIS LATER YEARS AND THE DEFIANT MANNER IN WHICH HE PRESENTED IT
5022-29405-0004 ALMOST MADE ME REGRET THAT HE HAD NOT DIED OF THE ILLNESS WHICH HAD STRUCK HIM DEAF
5022-29405-0005 AT ONE POSITIVE CONCLUSION AS STRANGERS HE AND I HAD FIRST MET AS STRANGERS I WAS DETERMINED WE SHOULD REMAIN HAVING MADE UP MY MIND SO FAR THE NEXT THING TO DO WITH THE CLOCK ON THE MANTEL PIECE STRIKING MIDNIGHT WAS TO GO TO BED
5022-29405-0006 I SLEPT BADLY THE EVENTS THAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE MY ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND HAD EXCITED ME I SUPPOSE NOW AND THEN IN THE WAKEFUL HOURS OF THE NIGHT I THOUGHT OF CRISTEL WITH SOME ANXIETY
5022-29405-0007 THE POOR GIRL AS I WAS STILL INCLINED TO FEAR MIGHT HAVE SERIOUS REASON TO REGRET THAT HE HAD EVER ENTERED HER FATHER'S COTTAGE AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE MY STEPMOTHER AND I MET AGAIN MISSUS ROYLAKE IN AN EXQUISITE MORNING DRESS WITH HER SMILE IN PERFECT ORDER
5022-29405-0008 INFORMED ME THAT SHE WAS DYING WITH CURIOSITY SHE HAD HEARD FROM THE SERVANTS THAT I HAD NOT RETURNED TO THE HOUSE UNTIL PAST TEN O'CLOCK ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AND SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY BEWILDERED BY THE DISCOVERY WHAT COULD HER DEAR GERARD HAVE BEEN DOING OUT IN THE DARK BY HIMSELF
5022-29405-0009 FOR ALL THAT TIME FOR SOME PART OF THE TIME I ANSWERED I WAS CATCHING MOTHS IN FORDWITCH WOOD
5022-29405-0010 MISSUS ROYLAKE'S FASCINATING SMILE DISAPPEARED WHEN I MENTIONED THE MILL SHE SUDDENLY BECAME A COLD LADY I MIGHT EVEN SAY A STIFF LADY
5022-29405-0011 OF COURSE THAT BOLD GIRL CONTRIVED TO ATTRACT YOUR NOTICE I REPLIED THAT I HAD MET WITH THE BOLD GIRL PURELY BY ACCIDENT ON HER SIDE AS WELL AS ON MINE AND THEN I STARTED A NEW TOPIC
5022-29405-0012 WAS IT A PLEASANT DINNER PARTY LAST NIGHT I ASKED AS IF THE SUBJECT REALLY INTERESTED ME I HAD NOT BEEN QUITE FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS IN ENGLAND YET AND I WAS BECOMING A HUMBUG ALREADY
5022-29405-0013 MY STEPMOTHER WAS HER CHARMING SELF AGAIN THE MOMENT MY QUESTION HAD PASSED MY LIPS SOCIETY PROVIDED IT WAS NOT SOCIETY AT THE MILL WAS ALWAYS ATTRACTIVE AS A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION YOUR ABSENCE WAS THE ONLY DRAWBACK SHE ANSWERED
5022-29405-0014 I HAVE ASKED THE TWO LADIES MY LORD HAS AN ENGAGEMENT TO DINE HERE TO DAY WITHOUT CEREMONY THEY ARE MOST ANXIOUS TO MEET YOU MY DEAR GERARD YOU LOOK SURPRISED
5022-29405-0015 I WAS OBLIGED TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY IGNORANCE MISSUS ROYLAKE WAS SHOCKED AT ANY RATE SHE RESUMED YOU HAVE HEARD OF THEIR FATHER LORD UPPERCLIFF I MADE ANOTHER SHAMEFUL CONFESSION
5022-29405-0016 EITHER I HAD FORGOTTEN LORD UPPERCLIFF DURING MY LONG ABSENCE ABROAD OR I HAD NEVER HEARD OF HIM
5022-29405-0017 WE WILL DRIVE OUT AFTER LUNCHEON AND PAY A ROUND OF VISITS WHEN THIS PROSPECT WAS PLACED BEFORE ME I REMEMBERED HAVING READ IN BOOKS OF SENSITIVE PERSONS RECEIVING IMPRESSIONS WHICH MADE THEIR BLOOD RUN COLD
5022-29405-0018 I MUST TELL YOU THAT LADY RACHEL IS THE ELDEST SHE IS MARRIED TO THE HONORABLE CAPTAIN MILLBAY OF THE NAVY NOW AWAY IN HIS SHIP A PERSON OF EXTRAORDINARY STRENGTH OF MIND I DON'T MEAN THE CAPTAIN I MEAN LADY RACHEL
5022-29405-0019 I ADMIRE HER INTELLECT BUT HER POLITICAL AND SOCIAL OPINIONS I MUST ALWAYS VIEW WITH REGRET
5022-29405-0020 IS SIMPLY THE MOST CHARMING GIRL IN ENGLAND IF YOU DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH HER
5022-29405-0021 POOR SIR GEORGE SHE REFUSED HIM LAST WEEK YOU REALLY MUST HAVE HEARD OF SIR GEORGE OUR MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT CONSERVATIVE OF COURSE QUITE BROKEN HEARTED ABOUT LADY LENA GONE AWAY TO AMERICA TO SHOOT BEARS
5022-29405-0022 YOU WANT TO SMOKE AFTER BREAKFAST WELL I WON'T BE IN YOUR WAY GO OUT ON THE TERRACE YOUR POOR FATHER ALWAYS TOOK HIS CIGAR ON THE TERRACE THEY SAY SMOKING LEADS TO MEDITATION I LEAVE YOU TO MEDITATE ON LADY LENA DON'T FORGET
5022-29405-0023 SHE SMILED AND KISSED HER HAND AND FLUTTERED OUT OF THE ROOM CHARMING PERFECTLY CHARMING AND YET I WAS UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO WISH MYSELF BACK IN GERMANY AGAIN I LIT MY CIGAR BUT NOT ON THE TERRACE
5022-29405-0024 LEAVING THE HOUSE I TOOK THE WAY ONCE MORE THAT LED TO FORDWITCH WOOD WHAT WOULD MISSUS ROYLAKE HAVE SAID IF SHE HAD DISCOVERED THAT I WAS GOING BACK TO THE MILL THERE WAS NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE THE PORTFOLIO WAS A TRUST CONFIDED TO ME
5022-29405-0025 THE SOONER I RETURNED IT TO THE WRITER OF THE CONFESSION THE SOONER I TOLD HIM PLAINLY THE CONCLUSION AT WHICH I HAD ARRIVED THE MORE AT EASE MY MIND WOULD BE THE SLUGGISH RIVER LOOKED MUDDIER THAN EVER THE NEW COTTAGE LOOKED UGLIER THAN EVER
5022-29405-0026 I KNOCKED AT THE DOOR ON THE ANCIENT SIDE OF THE BUILDING
5022-29405-0027 HE STARED AT ME IN MOMENTARY PERPLEXITY AND SUDDENLY RECOVERING HIMSELF ASKED ME TO WALK IN ARE YOU THE YOUNG MASTER SIR AH YES YES I THOUGHT SO MY GIRL CRISTY SAID SHE SAW THE YOUNG MASTER LAST NIGHT THANK YOU KINDLY SIR I'M PRETTY WELL
5022-29405-0028 MY MEALS DON'T SHOW ON ME YOU WILL EXCUSE MY RECEIVING YOU IN THE KITCHEN SIR IT'S THE BEST ROOM WE HAVE DID CRISTY TELL YOU HOW BADLY WE ARE OFF HERE FOR REPAIRS YOU BEING OUR LANDLORD WE LOOK TO YOU TO HELP US WE ARE FALLING TO PIECES AS IT WERE
5022-29405-0029 ON THIS OLD SIDE OF THE HOUSE THERE'S FIRST DRAINS HE PROCEEDED TO RECKON UP THE REPAIRS COUNTING WITH HIS FLESHLESS THUMB ON HIS SKINNY FINGERS WHEN HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A CURIOUS SUCCESSION OF SOUNDS WHICH BEGAN WITH WHINING AND ENDED WITH SCRATCHING AT THE COTTAGE DOOR
5022-29405-0030 IN A MINUTE AFTER THE DOOR WAS OPENED FROM WITHOUT A BROWN DOG OF THE COMPANIONABLE RETRIEVER BREED RAN IN AND FAWNED UPON OLD TOLLER CRISTEL FOLLOWED FROM THE KITCHEN GARDEN WITH A BASKET OF VEGETABLES ON HER ARM
5022-29405-0031 I NOW SAW IN THEIR FULL BEAUTY THE LUSTER OF HER BROWN EYES THE WARM ROSINESS OF HER DARK COMPLEXION THE DELIGHTFUL VIVACITY OF EXPRESSION WHICH WAS THE CROWNING CHARM OF HER FACE SHE PAUSED CONFUSEDLY IN THE DOORWAY
5022-29405-0032 AND TRIED TO RESIST ME WHEN I INSISTED ON RELIEVING HER OF THE BASKET MISTER GERARD SHE PROTESTED
5022-29405-0033 MY ANSWER WOULD NO DOUBT HAVE ASSUMED THE FORM OF A FOOLISH COMPLIMENT IF HER FATHER HAD NOT SPARED HER THAT INFLICTION
5022-29405-0034 HE SAYS ALL RIGHT AND HE DOES NOTHING THERE'S FIRST AS I TOLD YOU JUST NOW THE TRULY DREADFUL STATE OF THE DRAINS I TRIED TO STOP HIM BY PROMISING TO SPEAK TO THE BAILIFF MYSELF ON HEARING THIS GOOD NEWS MISTER TOLLER'S GRATITUDE BECAME UNGOVERNABLE
5022-29405-0035 HE WAS MORE EAGER THAN EVER AND MORE ELOQUENT THAN EVER IN RETURNING TO THE REPAIRS AND THEN SIR THERE'S THE OVEN THEY DO CALL BREAD THE STAFF OF LIFE IT'S A BURNT STAFF AT ONE TIME AND A CLAMMY STAFF AT ANOTHER
5022-29405-0036 HIS DAUGHTER INTERFERED AND STOPPED HIM AT THE CRITICAL MOMENT WHEN HE WAS ACTUALLY OFFERING HIS ARM TO CONDUCT ME IN STATE ACROSS THE KITCHEN CRISTEL HAD JUST PUT HER PRETTY BROWN HAND OVER HIS MOUTH AND SAID OH FATHER DO PRAY BE QUIET
5022-29405-0037 WHEN WE WERE ALL THREE DISTURBED BY ANOTHER INTERRUPTION A SECOND DOOR COMMUNICATING AS I CONCLUDED FROM ITS POSITION WITH THE NEW COTTAGE WAS SUDDENLY OPENED IN THE INSTANT BEFORE THE PERSON BEHIND IT APPEARED THE DOG LOOKED THAT WAY
5022-29405-0038 STARTED UP FRIGHTENED AND TOOK REFUGE UNDER THE TABLE AT THE NEXT MOMENT THE DEAF LODGER WALKED INTO THE ROOM IT WAS HE BEYOND ALL DOUBT WHO HAD FRIGHTENED THE DOG FOREWARNED BY INSTINCT OF HIS APPEARANCE
5022-29405-0039 WHAT I HAD READ OF HIS WRITING DISPOSED ME NOW THAT I SAW THE MAN BY DAYLIGHT TO FIND SOMETHING DEVILISH IN THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE NO STRONG AS IT WAS MY PREJUDICE FAILED TO MAKE ANY DISCOVERIES THAT PRESENTED HIM AT A DISADVANTAGE
5022-29405-0040 HIS PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS TRIUMPHED IN THE CLEAR SEARCHING LIGHT I NOW PERCEIVED THAT HIS EYES WERE OF THAT DEEPLY DARK BLUE WHICH IS COMMONLY AND FALSELY DESCRIBED AS RESEMBLING THE COLOR OF THE VIOLET TO MY THINKING THEY WERE SO ENTIRELY BEAUTIFUL
5022-29405-0041 THAT THEY HAD NO RIGHT TO BE IN A MAN'S FACE
5022-29405-0042 TO THE SOFT PROFUSION OF HIS REDDISH BROWN HAIR TO HIS FINELY SHAPED SENSITIVE LIPS BUT FOR TWO MARKED PECULIARITIES IN HIM WHICH WOULD HAVE SHOWN ME TO BE WRONG THAT IS TO SAY THE EXPRESSION OF POWER ABOUT HIS HEAD
5022-29405-0043 AND THE SIGNS OF MASCULINE RESOLUTION PRESENTED BY HIS MOUTH AND CHIN ON ENTERING THE ROOM THE FIRST PERSON AND THE ONLY PERSON WHO ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION WAS CRISTEL HE BOWED SMILED POSSESSED HIMSELF ABRUPTLY OF HER HAND AND KISSED IT
5022-29411-0000 MY LOYALTY TOWARDS THE AFFLICTED MAN WHOSE FRIENDLY ADVANCES I HAD SEEN GOOD REASON TO RETURN WAS IN NO SENSE SHAKEN HIS UNDESERVED MISFORTUNES HIS MANLY APPEAL TO ME AT THE SPRING
5022-29411-0001 STILL WHILE CRISTEL'S ENTREATIES AND CRISTEL'S INFLUENCE HAD FAILED TO SHAKE ME GLOODY'S STRANGE LANGUAGE AND GLOODY'S INCOMPREHENSIBLE CONDUCT HAD TROUBLED MY MIND I FELT VAGUELY UNEASY IRRITATED BY MY OWN DEPRESSION OF SPIRITS
5022-29411-0002 IF I HAD BEEN A PHILOSOPHER I SHOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED THE SYMPTOMS OF A VERY COMMON ATTACK OF A VERY WIDELY SPREAD MORAL MALADY THE MEANEST OF ALL HUMAN INFIRMITIES IS ALSO THE MOST UNIVERSAL AND THE NAME OF IT IS SELF ESTEEM
5022-29411-0003 IT IS PERHAPS ONLY RIGHT TO ADD THAT MY PATIENCE HAD BEEN TRIED BY THE PROGRESS OF DOMESTIC EVENTS WHICH AFFECTED LADY LENA AND MYSELF VIEWED AS VICTIMS CALLING WITH MY STEPMOTHER AT LORD UPPERCLIFF'S HOUSE LATER IN THE DAY
5022-29411-0004 OR MADE AN OPPORTUNITY OF TALKING TOGETHER CONFIDENTIALLY IN A CORNER AND ONCE OR TWICE I CAUGHT THEM LOOKING AT LADY LENA AND AT ME EVEN LORD UPPERCLIFF PERHAPS NOT YET TAKEN INTO THEIR CONFIDENCE
5022-29411-0005 NOTICED THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE TWO LADIES AND SEEMED TO BE AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND THEM WHEN MISSUS ROYLAKE AND I WERE TOGETHER AGAIN ON OUR WAY HOME I WAS PREPARED TO HEAR THE PRAISE OF LADY LENA FOLLOWED BY A DELICATE EXAMINATION INTO THE STATE OF MY HEART
5022-29411-0006 NEITHER OF THESE ANTICIPATIONS WAS REALIZED ONCE MORE MY CLEVER STEPMOTHER HAD PUZZLED ME MISSUS ROYLAKE TALKED AS FLUENTLY AS EVER EXHAUSTING ONE COMMON PLACE SUBJECT AFTER ANOTHER
5022-29411-0007 WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST ALLUSION TO MY LORD'S DAUGHTER TO MY MATRIMONIAL PROSPECTS OR TO MY VISITS AT THE MILL I WAS SECRETLY ANNOYED FEELING THAT MY STEPMOTHER'S SINGULAR INDIFFERENCE TO DOMESTIC INTERESTS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE
5022-29411-0008 RETURNING TO THE HOUSE I TRIED TO OCCUPY MYSELF WITH MY COLLECTION OF INSECTS SADLY NEGLECTED OF LATE USELESS MY OWN MOTHS FAILED TO INTEREST ME I WENT BACK TO THE GARDEN PASSING THE OPEN WINDOW OF ONE OF THE LOWER ROOMS WHICH LOOKED OUT ON THE TERRACE
5022-29411-0009 I SAW MISSUS ROYLAKE READING A BOOK IN SAD COLORED BINDING SHE WAS YAWNING OVER IT FEARFULLY WHEN SHE DISCOVERED THAT I WAS LOOKING AT HER EQUAL TO ANY EMERGENCY THIS REMARKABLE WOMAN INSTANTLY HANDED TO ME A SECOND AND SIMILAR VOLUME
5022-29411-0010 I LOOKED AT THE BOOK I OPENED THE BOOK I RECOVERED MY PRESENCE OF MIND AND HANDED IT BACK IF A FEMALE HUMBUG WAS ON ONE SIDE OF THE WINDOW A MALE HUMBUG WAS ON THE OTHER
5022-29411-0011 WHICH WAY DID I TURN MY STEPS MEN WILL WONDER WHAT POSSESSED ME WOMEN WILL THINK IT A PROCEEDING THAT DID ME CREDIT I TOOK THE FAMILIAR ROAD WHICH LED TO THE GLOOMY WOOD AND THE GUILTY RIVER THE LONGING IN ME TO SEE CRISTEL AGAIN WAS MORE THAN I COULD RESIST
5022-29411-0012 NOT BECAUSE I WAS IN LOVE WITH HER ONLY BECAUSE I HAD LEFT HER IN DISTRESS BEYOND THE SPRING AND WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE OF THE RIVER I SAW A LADY ADVANCING TOWARDS ME ON THE PATH WHICH LED FROM THE MILL BRISK SMILING TRIPPING ALONG LIKE A YOUNG GIRL
5022-29411-0013 BEHOLD THE MOCK REPUBLICAN KNOWN IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AS LADY RACHEL SHE HELD OUT BOTH HANDS TO ME BUT FOR HER PETTICOATS I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT I HAD MET WITH A JOLLY YOUNG MAN
5022-29411-0014 PATRONIZING PIETY ON THE WAY TO AFTERNOON CHURCH I MUST POSITIVELY MAKE A SKETCH OF THE COTTAGE BY THE MILL I MEAN OF COURSE THE PICTURESQUE SIDE OF IT THAT FINE GIRL OF TOLLER'S WAS STANDING AT THE DOOR SHE IS REALLY HANDSOMER THAN EVER ARE YOU GOING TO SEE HER YOU WICKED MAN
5022-29411-0015 WHEN WE HAD LEFT EACH OTHER I THOUGHT OF THE ABSENT CAPTAIN IN THE NAVY WHO WAS LADY RACHEL'S HUSBAND HE WAS A PERFECT STRANGER BUT I PUT MYSELF IN HIS PLACE AND FELT THAT I TOO SHOULD HAVE GONE TO SEA
5022-29411-0016 OLD TOLLER WAS ALONE IN HIS KITCHEN EVIDENTLY ANNOYED AND ANGRY WE ARE ALL AT SIXES AND SEVENS MISTER GERARD I'VE HAD ANOTHER ROW WITH THAT DEAF DEVIL MY NEW NAME FOR HIM AND I THINK IT'S RATHER CLEVER
5022-29411-0017 HE SWEARS SIR THAT HE WON'T GO AT THE END OF HIS WEEK'S NOTICE
5022-29411-0018 AND SHOOT THE MAN AND SHOOT HIMSELF AHA
5022-29411-0019 I'LL BE EVEN WITH HIM YOU MARK MY WORDS I'LL BE EVEN WITH HIM THAT OLD TOLLER THE MOST EXASPERATING OF MEN JUDGED BY A QUICK TEMPER HAD IRRITATED MY FRIEND INTO SPEAKING RASHLY WAS PLAIN ENOUGH NEVERTHELESS I FELT SOME ANXIETY
5022-29411-0020 ABOUT CRISTEL AFTER LOOKING ROUND THE KITCHEN AGAIN I ASKED WHERE SHE WAS SITTING FORLORN IN HER BEDROOM CRYING HER FATHER TOLD ME I WENT OUT FOR A WALK BY THE RIVER AND I SAT DOWN AND BEING SUNDAY I FELL ASLEEP WHEN I WOKE AND GOT HOME AGAIN JUST NOW THAT
5022-29411-0021 WAS HOW I FOUND HER I DON'T LIKE TO HEAR MY GIRL CRYING SHE'S AS GOOD AS GOLD AND BETTER NO SIR OUR DEAF DEVIL IS NOT TO BLAME FOR THIS HE HAS GIVEN CRISTY NO REASON TO COMPLAIN OF HIM SHE SAYS SO HERSELF AND SHE NEVER TOLD A LIE YET
5022-29411-0022 BUT MISTER TOLLER I OBJECTED SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED TO DISTRESS HER HAS SHE NOT TOLD YOU WHAT IT IS NOT SHE OBSTINATE ABOUT IT LEAVES ME TO GUESS IT'S CLEAR TO MY MIND MISTER GERARD THAT SOMEBODY HAS GOT AT HER IN MY ABSENCE
5022-29411-0023 YOU WILL ASK ME WHO THE PERSON IS
5022-29411-0024 BUT YOU MEAN TO TRY YES I MEAN TO TRY HE ANSWERED ME WITH LITTLE OF THE ENERGY WHICH GENERALLY DISTINGUISHED HIM PERHAPS HE WAS FATIGUED OR PERHAPS HE HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO THINK OF I OFFERED A SUGGESTION WHEN WE ARE
5022-29411-0025 IN WANT OF HELP I SAID WE SOMETIMES FIND IT NEARER THAN WE HAD VENTURED TO EXPECT AT OUR OWN DOORS THE ANCIENT MILLER ROSE AT THAT HINT LIKE A FISH AT A FLY GLOODY HE CRIED FIND HIM AT ONCE MISTER TOLLER
5022-29411-0026 I'VE GOT BURDENS ON MY MIND HE EXPLAINED OR I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT TOO HAVING DONE JUSTICE TO HIS OWN ABILITIES HE BUSTLED OUT IN LESS THAN A MINUTE HE WAS BACK AGAIN IN A STATE OF BREATHLESS TRIUMPH GLOODY HAS SEEN THE PERSON HE ANNOUNCED AND
5022-29411-0027 I BECKONED TO GLOODY WAITING MODESTLY AT THE DOOR TO COME IN AND TELL ME WHAT HE HAD DISCOVERED I SAW HER OUTSIDE SIR RAPPING AT THE DOOR HERE WITH HER PARASOL THAT WAS THE SERVANT'S REPORT HER PARASOL
5022-29411-0028 MISS CRISTEL LOOKED LIKE A PERSON SURPRISED AT SEEING A STRANGER WHAT I SHOULD CALL A FREE AND EASY STRANGER SHE WALKED IN SIR AS IF THE PLACE BELONGED TO HER I AM NOT SUSPICIOUS BY NATURE AS I HOPE AND BELIEVE
5022-29411-0029 THE HAT I HAD SEEN ON THE HEAD OF THAT HATEFUL WOMAN WAS NOW SUFFICIENTLY DESCRIBED FOR A MAN SLY OLD TOLLER LEAVING GLOODY UNNOTICED AND KEEPING HIS EYE ON ME SAW THE SIGNS OF CONVICTION IN MY FACE AND SAID WITH HIS CUSTOMARY AUDACITY
5022-29411-0030 WHO IS SHE I FOLLOWED AT MY HUMBLE DISTANCE THE EXAMPLE OF SIR WALTER SCOTT WHEN INQUISITIVE PEOPLE ASKED HIM IF HE WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE WAVERLEY NOVELS IN PLAIN ENGLISH I DENIED ALL KNOWLEDGE OF THE STRANGER WEARING THE GREEN HAT
5022-29411-0031 BUT I WAS NATURALLY DESIROUS OF DISCOVERING NEXT WHAT LADY RACHEL HAD SAID AND I ASKED TO SPEAK WITH CRISTEL HER FAR SEEING FATHER MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT HAVE PERCEIVED A CHANCE OF LISTENING TO OUR CONVERSATION
5022-29411-0032 HE LED ME TO THE DOOR OF HIS DAUGHTER'S ROOM AND STOOD CLOSE BY WHEN I KNOCKED SOFTLY AND BEGGED THAT SHE WOULD COME OUT THE TONE OF THE POOR GIRL'S VOICE ANSWERING FORGIVE ME SIR I CAN'T DO IT CONVICTED THE SHE SOCIALIST AS I THOUGHT
5022-29411-0033 OF MERCILESS CONDUCT OF SOME SORT ASSUMING THIS CONCLUSION TO BE THE RIGHT ONE I DETERMINED THEN AND THERE THAT LADY RACHEL SHOULD NOT PASS THE DOORS OF TRIMLEY DEEN AGAIN IF HER BOSOM FRIEND RESENTED THAT WISE ACT OF SEVERITY BY LEAVING THE HOUSE I SHOULD SUBMIT WITH RESIGNATION
5022-29411-0034 AND SHOULD REMEMBER THE CIRCUMSTANCE WITH PLEASURE I AM AFRAID YOU ARE ILL CRISTEL WAS ALL I COULD FIND TO SAY UNDER THE DOUBLE DISADVANTAGE OF SPEAKING THROUGH A DOOR AND HAVING A FATHER LISTENING AT MY SIDE OH NO MISTER GERARD NOT ILL
5022-29411-0035 PRAY BE KINDER TO ME THAN EVER PRAY LET ME BE I SAID I WOULD RETURN ON THE NEXT DAY AND LEFT THE ROOM WITH A SORE HEART OLD TOLLER HIGHLY APPROVED OF MY CONDUCT HE RUBBED HIS FLESHLESS HANDS AND WHISPERED
5022-29411-0036 YOU'LL GET IT OUT OF CRISTY TO MORROW AND I'LL HELP YOU I FOUND GLOODY WAITING FOR ME OUTSIDE THE COTTAGE HE WAS ANXIOUS ABOUT MISS CRISTEL HIS ONLY EXCUSE HE TOLD ME BEING THE FEAR THAT SHE MIGHT BE ILL HAVING SET HIM AT EASE IN THAT PARTICULAR I SAID
5022-29411-0037 YOU SEEM TO BE INTERESTED IN MISS CRISTEL HIS ANSWER RAISED HIM A STEP HIGHER IN MY ESTIMATION HOW CAN I HELP IT SIR AN ODD MAN WITH A PERSONAL APPEARANCE THAT MIGHT EXCITE A PREJUDICE AGAINST HIM IN SOME MINDS
5022-29411-0038 I FAILED TO SEE IT MYSELF IN THAT LIGHT IT STRUCK ME AS I WALKED HOME THAT CRISTEL MIGHT HAVE MADE MANY A WORSE FRIEND THAN THE RETIRED PRIZE FIGHTER A CHANGE IN MY MANNER WAS OF COURSE REMARKED BY MISSUS ROYLAKE'S READY OBSERVATION
5022-29411-0039 I TOLD HER THAT I HAD BEEN ANNOYED AND OFFERED NO OTHER EXPLANATION WONDERFUL TO RELATE SHE SHOWED NO CURIOSITY AND NO SURPRISE MORE WONDERFUL STILL AT EVERY FAIR OPPORTUNITY THAT OFFERED SHE KEPT OUT OF MY WAY
5022-29411-0040 MY NEXT DAY'S ENGAGEMENT BEING FOR SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING I PUT MISSUS ROYLAKE'S SELF CONTROL TO A NEW TEST WITH PREFATORY EXCUSES I INFORMED HER THAT I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DINE AT HOME AS USUAL IMPOSSIBLE AS IT WAS THAT SHE COULD HAVE BEEN PREPARED TO HEAR THIS
5022-29411-0041 ON THE RIVER MARGIN OF THE WOOD I WAS CONFRONTED BY A WILD GLEAM OF BEAUTY IN THE FAMILIAR VIEW FOR WHICH PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE HAD NOT PREPARED ME AM I WRONG IN BELIEVING THAT ALL SCENERY NO MATTER HOW MAGNIFICENT OR HOW HOMELY IT MAY BE
5022-29411-0042 DERIVES A SPLENDOR NOT ITS OWN FROM FAVOURING CONDITIONS OF LIGHT AND SHADE OUR GLOOMY TREES AND OUR REPELLENT RIVER PRESENTED AN ASPECT SUPERBLY TRANSFIGURED UNDER THE SHADOWS OF THE TOWERING CLOUDS THE FANTASTIC WREATHS OF THE MIST
5022-29411-0043 AND THE LURID REDDENING OF THE SUN AS IT STOOPED TO ITS SETTING LOVELY INTERFUSIONS OF SOBERED COLOR RESTED FADED RETURNED AGAIN ON THE UPPER LEAVES OF THE FOLIAGE AS THEY LIGHTLY MOVED THE MIST ROLLING CAPRICIOUSLY OVER THE WATERS
5022-29411-0044 WHILE IT DIMMED THE TURBID EARTHY YELLOW THAT DISCOLORED AND DEGRADED THE STREAM UNDER THE FULL GLARE OF DAY WHILE MY EYES FOLLOWED THE SUCCESSIVE TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE VIEW AS THE HOUR ADVANCED TENDER AND SOLEMN INFLUENCES BREATHED THEIR BALM OVER MY MIND
5022-29411-0045 DAYS HAPPY DAYS THAT WERE PAST REVIVED AGAIN I WALKED HAND IN HAND WITH MY MOTHER AMONG THE SCENES THAT WERE ROUND ME AND LEARNT FROM HER TO BE GRATEFUL FOR THE BEAUTY OF THE EARTH WITH A HEART THAT FELT IT
5022-29411-0046 WE WERE TRACING OUR WAY ALONG OUR FAVORITE WOODLAND PATH AND WE FOUND A COMPANION OF TENDER YEARS HIDING FROM US SHE SHOWED HERSELF BLUSHING HESITATING OFFERING A NOSEGAY OF WILD FLOWERS MY MOTHER WHISPERED TO ME
5022-29411-0047 I THANKED THE LITTLE MILL GIRL AND GAVE HER A KISS DID I FEEL THE CHILD'S BREATH IN MY DAY DREAM STILL FLUTTERING ON MY CHEEK WAS I CONSCIOUS OF HER TOUCH I STARTED TREMBLED RETURNED RELUCTANTLY TO MY PRESENT SELF
5022-29411-0048 A VISIBLE HAND TOUCHED MY ARM AS I TURNED SUDDENLY A LIVING BREATH PLAYED ON MY FACE THE CHILD HAD FADED INTO A VANISHING SHADE THE PERFECTED WOMAN WHO HAD GROWN FROM HER HAD STOLEN ON ME UNAWARES AND WAS ASKING ME TO PARDON HER
5022-29411-0049 MISTER GERARD YOU WERE LOST IN YOUR THOUGHTS I SPOKE AND YOU NEVER HEARD ME I LOOKED AT HER IN SILENCE WAS THIS THE DEAR CRISTEL SO WELL KNOWN TO ME OR WAS IT A MOCKERY OF HER THAT HAD TAKEN HER PLACE
5022-29411-0050 YOU HAVE SURPRISED ME I ANSWERED SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED SINCE I SAW YOU LAST WHAT IS IT NOTHING I ADVANCED A STEP AND DREW HER CLOSER TO ME A DARK FLUSH DISCOLORED HER FACE AN OVERPOWERING BRILLIANCY FLASHED FROM HER EYES
5022-29411-0051 THERE WAS AN HYSTERICAL DEFIANCE IN HER MANNER ARE YOU EXCITED ARE YOU ANGRY ARE YOU TRYING TO STARTLE ME BY ACTING A PART I URGED THOSE QUESTIONS ON HER ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND I WAS LOUDLY AND CONFIDENTLY ANSWERED
5022-29411-0052 THE DEAF GENTLEMAN SUBMITTED WHY DID YOU INVITE YOURSELF BECAUSE A TEA PARTY IS NOT COMPLETE WITHOUT A WOMAN HER MANNER WAS AS STRANGELY ALTERED AS HER LOOKS THAT SHE WAS BESIDE HERSELF FOR THE MOMENT I CLEARLY SAW
5022-29411-0053 I KNOW THAT SHE HAS VISITED YOU AND SPOKEN TO YOU DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHE HAS SAID I CAN GUESS
5022-29411-0054 HER MANNER HAD BECOME QUIETER HER FACE WAS MORE COMPOSED HER EXPRESSION ALMOST RECOVERED ITS NATURAL CHARM WHILE SHE SPOKE OF LADY RACHEL I WAS STUPEFIED TRY SIR TO FORGET IT AND FORGIVE IT SHE RESUMED GENTLY
5022-29411-0055 IF I HAVE MISBEHAVED MYSELF I DON'T RIGHTLY KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING OR DOING I POINTED TO THE NEW SIDE OF THE COTTAGE BEHIND US IS THE CAUSE THERE I ASKED NO NO INDEED
5022-29411-0056 IN THAT SHORT TIME I TOLD HER THAT HE HAD BEEN FOUND IN MY GARDEN LOOKING AT THE FLOWERS AS HE HAD DONE NO HARM I SAID
5022-29411-0057 AND FELT I DON'T DOUBT IT I HAD INTENDED TO SAY NO MORE THAN THIS BUT THE REMEMBRANCE OF GLOODY'S MYSTERIOUS PREVARICATION AND OF THE UNEASINESS WHICH I HAD UNDOUBTEDLY FELT WHEN I THOUGHT OF IT AFTERWARDS LED ME I CANNOT PRETEND TO SAY HOW
5022-29411-0058 INTO ASSOCIATING CRISTEL'S AGITATION WITH SOMETHING WHICH THIS MAN MIGHT HAVE SAID TO HER I WAS ON THE POINT OF PUTTING THE QUESTION WHEN SHE HELD UP HER HAND AND SAID HUSH THE WIND WAS BLOWING TOWARDS US FROM THE RIVER SIDE VILLAGE TO WHICH I HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED
5022-29411-0059 I AM NOT SURE WHETHER I HAVE MENTIONED THAT THE NAME OF THE PLACE WAS KYLAM IT WAS SITUATED BEHIND A PROMONTORY OF THE RIVER BANK CLOTHED THICKLY WITH TREES AND WAS NOT VISIBLE FROM THE MILL IN THE PRESENT DIRECTION OF THE WIND WE COULD HEAR THE STRIKING OF THE CHURCH CLOCK
5022-29411-0060 CRISTEL COUNTED THE STROKES SEVEN SHE SAID ARE YOU DETERMINED TO KEEP YOUR ENGAGEMENT SHE HAD REPEATED IN AN UNSTEADY VOICE AND WITH A SUDDEN CHANGE IN HER COLOR TO PALENESS THE STRANGE QUESTION PUT TO ME BY GLOODY
5022-29411-0061 IN HIS CASE I HAD FAILED TO TRACE THE MOTIVE I TRIED TO DISCOVER IT NOW TELL ME WHY I OUGHT TO BREAK MY ENGAGEMENT I SAID REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU AT THE SPRING SHE ANSWERED
5022-29411-0062 YOU ARE DECEIVED BY A FALSE FRIEND WHO LIES TO YOU AND HATES YOU THE MAN SHE WAS SPEAKING OF TURNED THE CORNER OF THE NEW COTTAGE
5022-29411-0063 IT'S TOO LATE NOW INSTEAD OF LETTING ME PRECEDE HER AS I HAD ANTICIPATED SHE RAN ON BEFORE ME MADE A SIGN TO THE DEAF MAN AS SHE PASSED HIM NOT TO STOP HER AND DISAPPEARED THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR OF HER FATHER'S SIDE OF THE COTTAGE
5022-29411-0064 I WAS LEFT TO DECIDE FOR MYSELF WHAT SHOULD I HAVE DONE IF I HAD BEEN TWENTY YEARS OLDER
5022-29411-0065 THE FEAR OF APPEARING TO BE AFRAID AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE MADE MY EXCUSES TO MY HOST OF THE EVENING HOW WOULD MY MORAL COURAGE HAVE ANSWERED HIM IF HE HAD ASKED FOR AN EXPLANATION USELESS TO SPECULATE ON IT HAD I POSSESSED THE WISDOM OF MIDDLE LIFE
5022-29411-0066 HIS BOOK OF LEAVES WOULD NOT HAVE TOLD HIM IN MY OWN HANDWRITING THAT I BELIEVED IN HIS BETTER NATURE
5022-29411-0067 EXPLAIN IT WHO CAN I KNEW THAT I WAS GOING TO DRINK TEA WITH HIM AND YET I WAS UNWILLING TO ADVANCE A FEW STEPS AND MEET HIM ON THE ROAD I FIND A NEW BOND OF UNION BETWEEN US HE SAID AS HE JOINED ME WE BOTH FEEL THAT
5022-29411-0068 HE POINTED TO THE GRANDLY DARKENING VIEW THE TWO MEN WHO COULD HAVE PAINTED THE MYSTERY OF THOSE GROWING SHADOWS AND FADING LIGHTS LIE IN THE GRAVES OF REMBRANDT AND TURNER SHALL WE GO TO TEA ON OUR WAY TO HIS ROOM WE STOPPED AT THE MILLER'S DOOR
5022-29411-0069 WILL YOU INQUIRE HE SAID IF MISS CRISTEL IS READY I WENT IN OLD TOLLER WAS IN THE KITCHEN SMOKING HIS PIPE WITHOUT APPEARING TO ENJOY IT WHAT'S COME TO MY GIRL HE ASKED THE MOMENT HE SAW ME
5022-29411-0070 TO DAY SHE'S IN HER ROOM PRAYING THE WARNINGS WHICH I HAD NEGLECTED ROSE IN JUDGMENT AGAINST ME I WAS SILENT I WAS AWED BEFORE I RECOVERED MYSELF CRISTEL ENTERED THE KITCHEN HER FATHER WHISPERED
5049-25947-0000 THE ROUGH RIDERS AT GUASIMAS ON THE DAY THE AMERICAN TROOPS LANDED ON THE COAST OF CUBA THE CUBANS INFORMED GENERAL WHEELER
5049-25947-0001 BLOCKING THE WAY TO SANTIAGO
5049-25947-0002 NOR EVEN A COLLECTION OF HOUSES IT IS THE MEETING PLACE OF TWO TRAILS WHICH JOIN AT THE APEX OF A V THREE MILES FROM THE SEAPORT TOWN OF SIBONEY AND CONTINUE MERGED IN A SINGLE TRAIL TO SANTIAGO
5049-25947-0003 GENERAL WHEELER GUIDED BY THE CUBANS RECONNOITRED THIS TRAIL ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE AND WITH THE POSITION OF THE ENEMY FULLY EXPLAINED TO HIM RETURNED TO SIBONEY AND INFORMED GENERAL YOUNG AND COLONEL WOOD
5049-25947-0004 THAT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING HE WOULD ATTACK THE SPANISH POSITION
5049-25947-0005 AND WHAT HE WAS TO DO WHEN HE FOUND HIM THAT NIGHT NO ONE SLEPT FOR UNTIL TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TROOPS WERE STILL BEING DISEMBARKED IN THE SURF AND TWO SHIPS OF WAR HAD THEIR SEARCHLIGHTS TURNED ON THE LANDING PLACE
5049-25947-0006 LAY THE CAMP OF THE ROUGH RIDERS AND THROUGH IT CUBAN OFFICERS WERE RIDING THEIR HALF STARVED PONIES AND SCATTERING THE ASHES OF THE CAMP FIRES
5049-25947-0007 BELOW THEM WAS THE BEACH AND THE ROARING SURF IN WHICH A THOUSAND OR SO NAKED MEN WERE ASSISTING AND IMPEDING THE PROGRESS SHOREWARD OF THEIR COMRADES IN PONTOONS AND SHORE BOATS
5049-25947-0008 WHICH WERE BEING HURLED AT THE BEACH LIKE SLEDS DOWN A WATER CHUTE IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST WEIRD AND REMARKABLE SCENES OF THE WAR PROBABLY OF ANY WAR
5049-25947-0009 OR SHOUTING WITH DELIGHT AS THEY PLUNGED INTO THE FIRST BATH THAT HAD OFFERED IN SEVEN DAYS AND THOSE IN THE LAUNCHES AS THEY WERE PITCHED HEAD FIRST AT THE SOIL OF CUBA SIGNALIZED THEIR ARRIVAL BY HOWLS OF TRIUMPH
5049-25947-0010 ON EITHER SIDE ROSE BLACK OVERHANGING RIDGES
5049-25947-0011 OF THE SEARCH LIGHTS SHAMING THE QUIET MOONLIGHT
5049-25947-0012 THE ROUGH RIDERS LEFT CAMP AT FIVE IN THE MORNING WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HALF A DOZEN OFFICERS THEY WERE DISMOUNTED AND CARRIED THEIR BLANKET ROLLS HAVERSACKS AMMUNITION AND CARBINES
5049-25947-0013 ALONG THE TRAIL TO THE WEST WHICH WAS ON HIGH GROUND AND A HALF MILE TO A MILE DISTANT FROM THE TRAIL ALONG WHICH GENERAL YOUNG AND HIS REGULARS WERE MARCHING
5049-25947-0014 THERE WAS A VALLEY BETWEEN US AND THE BUSHES WERE SO THICK ON BOTH SIDES OF OUR TRAIL
5049-25947-0015 TO DISTINGUISH THE OTHER COLUMN AS SOON AS THE ROUGH RIDERS HAD REACHED THE TOP OF THE RIDGE NOT TWENTY MINUTES AFTER THEY HAD LEFT CAMP WHICH WAS THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY THAT PRESENTED ITSELF COLONEL WOOD ORDERED CAPTAIN CAPRON
5049-25947-0016 NO FLANKERS WERE PLACED FOR THE REASON THAT THE DENSE UNDERGROWTH AND THE TANGLE OF VINES THAT STRETCHED FROM THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES TO THE BUSHES BELOW MADE IT A PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY
5049-25947-0017 A CUBAN OFFICER AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL ROOSEVELT THEY RODE SLOWLY IN CONSIDERATION OF THE TROOPERS ON FOOT WHO UNDER A CRUELLY HOT SUN CARRIED HEAVY BURDENS TO THOSE WHO DID NOT HAVE TO WALK
5049-25947-0018 WE ADVANCED TALKING IN THAT FASHION AND IN HIGH SPIRITS AND CONGRATULATING OURSELVES IN BEING SHUT OF THE TRANSPORT AND ON BREATHING FINE MOUNTAIN AIR AGAIN
5049-25947-0019 WE HAD BEEN RIDING IN THIS PLEASANT FASHION FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF WITH BRIEF HALTS FOR REST WHEN WOOD STOPPED THE HEAD OF THE COLUMN AND RODE DOWN THE TRAIL TO MEET CAPRON WHO WAS COMING BACK
5049-25947-0020 THERE WAS ON ONE SIDE OF IT A STOUT BARBED WIRE FENCE OF FIVE STRANDS BY SOME FORTUNATE ACCIDENT THIS FENCE HAD BEEN CUT JUST WHERE THE HEAD OF THE COLUMN HALTED ON THE LEFT OF THE TRAIL
5049-25947-0021 IT SHUT OFF FIELDS OF HIGH GRASS BLOCKED AT EVERY FIFTY YARDS WITH GREAT BARRICADES OF UNDERGROWTH AND TANGLED TREES AND CHAPPARAL ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRAIL
5049-25947-0022 THERE WAS NOT A FOOT OF FREE GROUND THE BUSHES SEEMED ABSOLUTELY IMPENETRABLE AS INDEED THEY WERE LATER FOUND TO BE WHEN WE HALTED THE MEN SAT
5049-25947-0023 OR FANNED THE AIR WITH THEIR HATS THEY HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE SITUATION SUCH AS THEIR LEADERS POSSESSED AND THEIR ONLY EMOTION WAS ONE OF SATISFACTION AT THE CHANCE THE HALT GAVE THEM
5049-25947-0024 AT THE READY PEERING INTO THE BUSHES WE MUST HAVE WAITED THERE WHILE WOOD RECONNOITRED FOR OVER TEN MINUTES THEN HE RETURNED AND BEGAN DEPLOYING HIS TROOPS OUT AT EITHER SIDE OF THE TRAIL
5049-25947-0025 G TROOP WAS ORDERED TO BEAT INTO THE BUSHES ON THE RIGHT AND K AND A WERE SENT OVER THE RIDGE ON WHICH WE STOOD DOWN INTO THE HOLLOW TO CONNECT WITH GENERAL YOUNG'S COLUMN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE VALLEY
5049-25947-0026 F AND E TROOPS WERE DEPLOYED IN SKIRMISH LINE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIRE FENCE WOOD HAD DISCOVERED THE ENEMY A FEW HUNDRED YARDS FROM WHERE HE EXPECTED TO FIND HIM AND SO FAR FROM BEING SURPRISED HE HAD TIME
5049-25947-0027 ACTING ON A FALSE ALARM AND THAT THERE WERE NO SPANIARDS AHEAD OF US I GUESSED IT WAS CAPRON'S MEN FIRING AT RANDOM TO DISCLOSE THE ENEMY'S POSITION I RAN AFTER G TROOP UNDER CAPTAIN LLEWELLYN AND FOUND
5049-25947-0028 HE WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE THICKET AT ONE MOMENT THE UNDERBRUSH SEEMED SWARMING WITH OUR MEN AND THE NEXT EXCEPT THAT YOU HEARD THE TWIGS BREAKING AND HEAVY BREATHING OR A CRASH AS A VINE PULLED SOME ONE DOWN
5049-25947-0029 THROUGH THE TWO HOURS OF FIGHTING THAT FOLLOWED ALTHOUGH MEN WERE FALLING ALL AROUND US THE SPANIARDS ON THE RIDGE WERE THE ONLY ONES THAT MANY OF US SAW BUT THE FIRE AGAINST US WAS NOT MORE THAN EIGHTY YARDS AWAY
5049-25947-0030 AND SO HOT THAT OUR MEN COULD ONLY LIE FLAT IN THE GRASS AND RETURN IT IN THAT POSITION IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT OUR MEN BELIEVED THEY WERE BEING
5049-25947-0031 WHICH THEY IMAGINED MUST HAVE SWUNG TO THE RIGHT AND HAVING LOST ITS BEARINGS AND HEARING THEM ADVANCING THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH HAD MISTAKEN THEM FOR THE ENEMY THEY ACCORDINGLY CEASED FIRING AND BEGAN SHOUTING
5049-25947-0032 LATER WE EXAMINED THE RELATIVE POSITION OF THE TRAIL WHICH CAPRON HELD AND THE POSITION OF G TROOP AND THEY WERE AT RIGHT ANGLES TO ONE ANOTHER
5049-25947-0033 CAPRON COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE FIRED INTO US AT ANY TIME UNLESS HE HAD TURNED DIRECTLY AROUND IN HIS TRACKS AND AIMED UP THE VERY TRAIL HE HAD JUST DESCENDED
5049-25947-0034 THEY COULD NOT SEE TWENTY FEET ON THREE SIDES OF THEM BUT ON THE RIGHT HAND LAY THE VALLEY AND ACROSS IT CAME THE SOUND OF YOUNG'S BRIGADE WHO WERE APPARENTLY HEAVILY ENGAGED
5049-25947-0035 THE ENEMY'S FIRE WAS SO CLOSE THAT THE MEN COULD NOT HEAR THE WORD OF COMMAND AND CAPTAIN LLEWELLYN AND LIEUTENANT GREENWAY UNABLE TO GET THEIR ATTENTION RAN AMONG THEM
5049-25947-0036 LIEUTENANT COLONEL ROOSEVELT RAN UP JUST THEN BRINGING WITH HIM LIEUTENANT WOODBURY KANE AND TEN TROOPERS FROM K TROOP ROOSEVELT LAY DOWN IN THE GRASS BESIDE LLEWELLYN AND CONSULTED WITH HIM EAGERLY
5049-25947-0037 KANE WAS SMILING WITH THE CHARMING CONTENT OF A PERFECTLY HAPPY MAN WHEN CAPTAIN LLEWELLYN TOLD HIM HIS MEN WERE NOT NEEDED AND TO REJOIN HIS TROOP HE LED HIS DETAIL OVER THE EDGE OF THE HILL ON WHICH WE LAY
5049-25947-0038 BUT WALKED ERECT STILL SMILING ROOSEVELT POINTED OUT THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ADVANCE FARTHER ON ACCOUNT OF THE NETWORK OF WILD GRAPE VINES THAT MASKED THE SPANIARDS FROM US AND THAT WE MUST CROSS THE TRAIL
5049-25947-0039 DRAGGING THE WOUNDED WITH US OWING TO THE LOW AIM OF THE ENEMY WE WERE FORCED TO MOVE ON OUR KNEES AND CRAWL EVEN THEN MEN WERE HIT ONE MAN NEAR ME WAS SHOT THROUGH THE HEAD
5049-25947-0040 IT HAD BEEN ORDERED TO ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION WITH GENERAL YOUNG'S COLUMN AND WHILE ADVANCING AND FIRING ON THE RIDGE CAPTAIN JENKINS SENT
5049-25947-0041 BEARER BACK TO CLIMB THE HILL AND WAVE HIS RED AND WHITE BANNER WHERE YOUNG'S MEN COULD SEE IT
5049-25947-0042 BUT HE CONTINUED WAVING IT UNTIL THE TENTH CAVALRY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VALLEY ANSWERED AND THE TWO COLUMNS WERE CONNECTED BY A SKIRMISH LINE COMPOSED OF K TROOP AND A UNDER CAPTAIN BUCKY O'NEILL
5049-25947-0043 G TROOP MEANWHILE HAD HURRIED OVER TO THE LEFT AND PASSING THROUGH THE OPENING IN THE WIRE FENCE HAD SPREAD OUT INTO OPEN ORDER IT FOLLOWED DOWN AFTER CAPTAIN LUNA'S TROOP AND D AND E TROOPS
5049-25947-0044 WHICH WERE WELL ALREADY IN ADVANCE
5049-25947-0045 WOOD WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN ALONG IT LEADING HIS HORSE WHICH HE THOUGHT MIGHT BE OF USE IN CASE HE HAD TO MOVE QUICKLY TO ALTER HIS ORIGINAL FORMATION
5049-25947-0046 HIS PLAN AT PRESENT WAS TO SPREAD OUT HIS MEN SO THAT THEY WOULD JOIN YOUNG ON THE RIGHT AND ON THE LEFT SWING AROUND UNTIL THEY FLANKED THE ENEMY K AND A TROOPS
5049-25947-0047 IT WAS ONLY BY THE FIRING THAT HE COULD TELL WHERE HIS MEN LAY AND THAT THEY WERE ALWAYS ADVANCING THE ADVANCES WERE MADE IN QUICK DESPERATE RUSHES SOMETIMES THE GROUND GAINED
5049-25947-0048 WAS NO MORE THAN A MAN COVERS IN SLIDING FOR A BASE AT OTHER TIMES HALF A TROOP WOULD RISE AND RACE FORWARD AND THEN BURROW DEEP IN THE HOT GRASS AND FIRE
5049-25947-0049 THE FIRE DISCIPLINE WAS EXCELLENT THE PROPHETS OF EVIL OF THE TAMPA BAY HOTEL HAD FORETOLD THAT THE COWBOYS WOULD SHOOT AS THEY CHOSE AND IN THE FIELD WOULD ACT INDEPENDENTLY OF THEIR OFFICERS
5049-25947-0050 HANDICAPPED THEIR STRENGTH CRUELLY THE ENEMY WAS HIDDEN IN THE SHADE OF THE JUNGLE WHILE THEY FOR EVERY THICKET THEY GAINED
5049-25947-0051 WHICH WAS AS HOT AS A STEAM BATH AND WITH THEIR FLESH AND CLOTHING TORN BY THORNS AND THE SWORD LIKE BLADE OF THE SPANISH BAYONET THE GLARE OF THE SUN WAS FULL IN THEIR EYES AND AS FIERCE AS A LIME LIGHT
5049-25947-0052 IT HAD BEEN CONVERTED INTO A DRESSING STATION AND THE WOUNDED OF G TROOP WERE LEFT THERE IN THE CARE OF THE HOSPITAL STEWARDS A TALL GAUNT YOUNG MAN WITH A CROSS ON HIS ARM WAS JUST COMING BACK UP THE TRAIL HIS HEAD WAS BENT
5049-25947-0053 I KNEW IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS AND YET HE WAS CERTAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH ANOTHER TIME OF EXCITEMENT AND RUSH AND HEAT THEN I REMEMBERED HIM AS NOW HE HAD BEEN COVERED WITH BLOOD AND DIRT AND PERSPIRATION
5049-25947-0054 BUT THEN HE WORE A CANVAS JACKET AND THE MAN HE CARRIED ON HIS SHOULDERS WAS TRYING TO HOLD HIM BACK FROM A WHITE WASHED LINE AND I RECOGNIZED THE YOUNG DOCTOR WITH THE BLOOD BATHING HIS BREECHES AS BOB CHURCH
5049-25947-0055 AND THAT SO FEW OF THEM DIED IS GREATLY DUE TO THIS YOUNG MAN WHO WENT DOWN INTO THE FIRING LINE AND PULLED THEM FROM IT AND BORE THEM OUT OF DANGER
5049-25947-0056 AND THE COLLEGE SWELLS OF THE ROUGH RIDERS
5049-25947-0057 THE WALK DOWN THAT TRAIL PRESENTED ONE OF THE MOST GREWSOME PICTURES OF THE WAR
5049-25947-0058 HAD BEEN ABANDONED ALL ALONG ITS LENGTH IT LOOKED AS THOUGH A RETREATING ARMY HAD FLED ALONG IT RATHER THAN THAT ONE TROOP HAD FOUGHT ITS WAY THROUGH IT TO THE FRONT
5049-25947-0059 FOR THE WOUNDED LYING ALONG ITS LENGTH WERE AS STILL AS THE DEAD BESIDE THEM THE NOISE OF THE LOOSE STONES ROLLING UNDER MY FEET BROUGHT A HOSPITAL STEWARD OUT OF THE BRUSH AND HE CALLED AFTER ME
5049-25947-0060 LIEUTENANT THOMAS IS BADLY WOUNDED IN HERE AND WE CAN'T MOVE HIM
5049-25947-0061 SOME PLACE WHERE THERE IS SHADE AND A BREEZE
5049-25947-0062 LARGE AND POWERFULLY BUILT HE WAS SHOT THROUGH THE LEG JUST BELOW THE TRUNK AND I FOUND HIM LYING ON A BLANKET HALF NAKED AND COVERED WITH BLOOD AND WITH HIS LEG BOUND IN TOURNIQUETS MADE OF TWIGS AND POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS
5049-25947-0063 IT GAVE ONE A THRILL OF AWE AND WONDER TO SEE HOW THESE COWBOY SURGEONS WITH A STICK THAT ONE WOULD USE TO LIGHT A PIPE AND WITH THE GAUDY KERCHIEFS THEY HAD TAKEN FROM THEIR NECKS
5049-25947-0064 YOU'RE TAKING ME TO THE FRONT AREN'T YOU YOU SAID YOU WOULD THEY'VE KILLED MY CAPTAIN DO YOU UNDERSTAND THEY'VE KILLED CAPTAIN CAPRON THE MEXICANS THEY'VE KILLED MY CAPTAIN
5049-25947-0065 BUT HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WE STUMBLED OVER THE STONES AND VINES BUMPING HIS WOUNDED BODY AGAINST THE GROUND AND LEAVING A BLACK STREAK IN THE GRASS BEHIND US BUT IT SEEMED TO HURT US MORE THAN IT DID HIM
5049-25947-0066 GRAVE BOYISH FACES FILLED WITH SYMPATHY AND CONCERN ONLY FIFTY FEET FROM HIM AND FARTHER DOWN THE TRAIL I PASSED HIS CAPTAIN WITH HIS BODY PROPPED AGAINST CHURCH'S KNEE
5049-25947-0067 AND WITH HIS HEAD FALLEN ON THE SURGEON'S SHOULDER CAPRON WAS ALWAYS A HANDSOME SOLDIERLY LOOKING MAN
5049-25947-0068 AND AS I SAW HIM THEN DEATH HAD GIVEN HIM A GREAT DIGNITY AND NOBLENESS HE WAS ONLY TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OLD THE AGE WHEN LIFE HAS JUST BEGUN
5049-25947-0069 WITH IT AND THAT THOUGH THEY MIGHT PECK AND MEND AT THE BODY HE HAD RECEIVED HIS FINAL ORDERS
5049-25947-0070 STRANGELY MEAN AND TAWDRY
5049-25947-0071 A BOY WAS LYING WITH A BULLET WOUND BETWEEN HIS EYES HIS CHEST WAS HEAVING WITH SHORT HOARSE NOISES WHICH I GUESSED WERE DUE TO SOME MUSCULAR ACTION ENTIRELY AND THAT HE WAS VIRTUALLY DEAD
5049-25947-0072 SCRIBBLED IN IT IN PENCIL
5049-25947-0073 WE ONLY MET TWO WEEKS AGO AT SAN ANTONIO BUT HE AND ME HAD GOT TO BE SUCH GOOD FRIENDS BUT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO NOW
5049-25947-0074 WAS WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE FARTHEST POINT
5049-25947-0075 AND I WAS RUNNING FORWARD FEELING CONFIDENT THAT I MUST BE CLOSE ON OUR MEN WHEN I SAW THE BODY OF A SERGEANT BLOCKING THE TRAIL AND STRETCHED AT FULL LENGTH ACROSS IT
5049-25947-0076 IT WAS APPARENTLY THE BODY OF THE FIRST MAN KILLED AFTER DEATH THE BODIES OF SOME MEN SEEM TO SHRINK ALMOST INSTANTLY WITHIN THEMSELVES THEY BECOME LIMP AND SHAPELESS
5049-25947-0077 WITH HIS REGIMENT BEHIND HIM AND FACING THE ENEMIES OF HIS COUNTRY THE LINE AT THIS TIME WAS DIVIDED BY THE TRAIL INTO TWO WINGS THE RIGHT WING COMPOSED OF K AND A TROOPS WAS ADVANCING THROUGH THE VALLEY
5049-25947-0078 I BORROWED A CARBINE FROM A WOUNDED MAN AND JOINED THE REMNANT OF L TROOP WHICH WAS CLOSE TO THE TRAIL THIS TROOP WAS THEN COMMANDED BY SECOND LIEUTENANT DAY WHO ON ACCOUNT OF HIS CONDUCT THAT MORNING
5049-25947-0079 AND AT THE BATTLE OF SAN JUAN LATER WHEN HE WAS SHOT THROUGH THE ARM WAS PROMOTED TO BE CAPTAIN OF L TROOP OR AS IT WAS LATER OFFICIALLY DESIGNATED CAPRON'S TROOP HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE LINE AS UNCONCERNEDLY
5049-25947-0080 AS THOUGH WE WERE AT TARGET PRACTICE AND AN IRISH SERGEANT BYRNE WAS ASSISTING HIM BY KEEPING UP A CONTINUOUS FLOW OF COMMENTS AND CRITICISMS THAT SHOWED THE KEENEST ENJOYMENT OF THE SITUATION
5049-25947-0081 BYRNE WAS THE ONLY MAN I NOTICED WHO SEEMED TO REGARD THE FIGHT AS IN ANY WAY HUMOROUS
5049-25947-0082 THE CONDITIONS WERE EXCEPTIONAL
5049-25947-0083 AND EIGHTY PER CENT OF THEM HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN UNDER FIRE NOR HAD ONE MAN IN THE REGIMENT EVER FIRED A KRAG JORGENSEN CARBINE UNTIL HE FIRED IT AT A SPANIARD
5049-25947-0084 FOR THEIR ARMS HAD BEEN ISSUED TO THEM SO SOON BEFORE SAILING THAT THEY HAD ONLY DRILLED WITH THEM WITHOUT USING CARTRIDGES TO THIS HANDICAP WAS ALSO ADDED THE NATURE OF THE GROUND
5049-25947-0085 AND THE FACT THAT OUR MEN COULD NOT SEE THEIR OPPONENTS THEIR OWN MEN FELL OR ROLLED OVER ON EVERY SIDE SHOT DOWN BY AN INVISIBLE ENEMY WITH NO ONE UPON WHOM THEY COULD RETALIATE
5049-25947-0086 WITH NO SIGN THAT THE ATTACK MIGHT NOT GO ON INDEFINITELY YET THEY NEVER ONCE TOOK A STEP BACKWARD BUT ADVANCED GRIMLY CLEANING A BUSH OR THICKET OF ITS OCCUPANTS BEFORE CHARGING IT
5049-25947-0087 AND SECURING ITS COVER FOR THEMSELVES AND ANSWERING EACH VOLLEY WITH ONE THAT SOUNDED LIKE AN ECHO OF THE FIRST THE MEN WERE PANTING FOR BREATH THE SWEAT RAN SO READILY INTO THEIR EYES THAT THEY COULD NOT SEE THE SIGHTS OF THEIR GUNS
5049-25947-0088 THEIR LIMBS UNUSED TO SUCH EXERTION AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF CRAMPED IDLENESS ON THE TROOP SHIP TREMBLED WITH WEAKNESS AND THE SUN BLINDED
5049-25947-0089 BUT TIME AFTER TIME THEY ROSE AND STAGGERED FORWARD THROUGH THE HIGH GRASS
5049-25947-0090 AND PASSING THROUGH A SUCCESSION OF CONVULSIONS HE NEVERTHELESS IN HIS BRIEF MOMENTS OF COMPARATIVE PEACE BORE HIMSELF WITH THE UTMOST CALM
5049-25947-0091 A SOLDIER TO DUTY THAT HE CONTINUED WRITING HIS ACCOUNT OF THE FIGHT
5049-25947-0092 AS AN EXCUSE TO GO TO LEAVE THE FIRING LINE I HAVE WATCHED OTHER FIGHTS WHERE THE MEN ENGAGED WERE QUITE WILLING TO UNSELFISHLY BEAR THE WOUNDED FROM THE ZONE OF DANGER
5049-25947-0093 FOR AGUARDIENTE AND WAS NOW OCCUPIED IN FORCE BY THE ENEMY LIEUTENANT COLONEL ROOSEVELT ON THE FAR LEFT WAS MOVING UP HIS MEN WITH THE INTENTION OF TAKING THIS HOUSE ON THE FLANK
5049-25947-0094 WOOD WHO WAS ALL OVER THE LINE HAD THE SAME OBJECTIVE POINT IN HIS MIND THE TROOP COMMANDERS HAD A GENERAL IDEA THAT THE DISTILLERY WAS THE KEY TO THE ENEMY'S POSITION AND WERE ALL WORKING IN THAT DIRECTION
5049-25947-0095 IT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR WOOD AND ROOSEVELT TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE CAPTAINS AND AFTER THE FIRST GENERAL ORDERS HAD BEEN GIVEN THEM THEY RELIED UPON THE LATTER'S INTELLIGENCE TO PULL THEM THROUGH
5049-25947-0096 I DO NOT SUPPOSE WOOD OUT OF THE FIVE HUNDRED ENGAGED SAW MORE THAN THIRTY OF HIS MEN
5049-25947-0097 SO EXCELLENT WAS THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE OFFICERS AND SO READY THE SPIRIT OF THE MEN THAT THEY KEPT AN ALMOST PERFECT ALIGNMENT AS WAS SHOWN WHEN THE FINAL ORDER CAME TO CHARGE IN THE OPEN FIELDS
5049-25947-0098 SOME OF THE MEN WHO WERE TWICE DAY'S AGE BEGGED HIM TO LET THEM TAKE THE ENEMY'S IMPROMPTU FORT ON THE RUN BUT HE ANSWERED THEM TOLERANTLY LIKE SPOILED CHILDREN AND HELD THEM DOWN UNTIL THERE WAS A LULL IN THE ENEMY'S FIRE
5049-25947-0099 AND RAN FOR THE COVER THEY WERE DIRECTED TO TAKE LIKE MEN TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE RAIN AND FELL PANTING ON THEIR FACES WHILE THE WESTERN TRAPPERS AND HUNTERS SLIPPED AND WRIGGLED THROUGH THE GRASS LIKE INDIANS
5049-25947-0100 DODGING FROM TREE TRUNK TO TREE TRUNK AND FROM ONE BUSH TO ANOTHER THEY FELL INTO LINE AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE OTHERS BUT WHILE DOING SO THEY HAD NOT ONCE EXPOSED THEMSELVES
5049-25947-0101 SOME OF THE ESCAPES WERE LITTLE SHORT OF MIRACULOUS THE MAN ON MY RIGHT CHAMPNEYS MARSHALL OF WASHINGTON HAD ONE BULLET PASS THROUGH HIS SLEEVE AND ANOTHER PASS THROUGH HIS SHIRT WHERE IT WAS PULLED CLOSE TO HIS SPINE
5049-25947-0102 AND ROOSEVELT WAS SO CLOSE TO ONE BULLET WHEN IT STRUCK A TREE THAT IT FILLED HIS EYES AND EARS WITH TINY SPLINTERS MAJOR BRODIE AND LIEUTENANT THOMAS WERE BOTH WOUNDED WITHIN A FEW FEET OF COLONEL WOOD
5049-25947-0103 AT SIBONEY ROWLAND SAT STILL FOR A SHORT TIME
5049-25947-0104 WITH THE REST OF THE WOUNDED BUT TWO DAYS LATER HE APPEARED IN CAMP
5049-25947-0105 A DISTANCE OF SIX MILES AND UPHILL ALL THE WAY CARRYING HIS CARBINE CANTEEN AND CARTRIDGE BELT I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN HOSPITAL WOOD SAID I WAS ROWLAND ANSWERED SHEEPISHLY
5049-25947-0106 WHEN SHOT THROUGH THE BODY ASKED TO BE PROPPED UP AGAINST A TREE WITH HIS CANTEEN AND CARTRIDGE BELT BESIDE HIM AND THE LAST HIS TROOP SAW OF HIM HE WAS SEATED ALONE GRIMLY FIRING OVER THEIR HEADS
5049-25947-0107 IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ENEMY EARLY IN THE FIGHT I CAME UPON CHURCH ATTENDING TO A YOUNG COWBOY WHO WAS SHOT THROUGH THE CHEST
5049-25947-0108 THE ENTRANCE TO HIS WOUND WAS SO SMALL THAT CHURCH COULD NOT INSERT ENOUGH OF THE GAUZE PACKING TO STOP THE FLOW OF BLOOD I'M AFRAID I'LL HAVE TO MAKE THIS HOLE LARGER HE SAID TO THE BOY OR YOU'LL BLEED TO DEATH
5049-25947-0109 CAN YOU STAND BEING CARRIED DO YOU THINK YOU CAN CARRY ME THE TROOPER ASKED YES WELL EXCLAIMED THE BOY ADMIRINGLY YOU CERTAINLY KNOW YOUR BUSINESS
5049-25947-0110 GAVE HIM HIS CHOICE OF RIDING DOWN TO SIBONEY
5049-25947-0111 OR OF BEING CARRIED A DAY LATER ON A LITTER
5049-25947-0112 YOU CAN START AT ONCE BUT IF YOU WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW WHEN I CAN SPARE THE MEN YOU CAN BE CARRIED ALL THE WAY
5049-25947-0113 AND INTO A HUGE MEXICAN SADDLE HE STUCK HIS WOUNDED ANKLE INTO ONE STIRRUP AND HIS UNTOUCHED ONE INTO THE OTHER AND GATHERED UP THE REINS DOES IT PAIN YOU CAN YOU STAND IT
5049-25947-0114 THE FIRING FROM THE ENEMY SOUNDED LESS NEAR AND THE BULLETS PASSED MUCH HIGHER ROOSEVELT WHO HAD PICKED UP A CARBINE AND WAS FIRING TO GIVE THE DIRECTION TO THE OTHERS DETERMINED UPON A CHARGE
5049-25947-0115 WOOD AT THE OTHER END OF THE LINE DECIDED AT THE SAME TIME UPON THE SAME MANOEUVRE IT WAS CALLED WOOD'S BLUFF AFTERWARD FOR HE HAD NOTHING TO BACK IT WITH
5049-25947-0116 WHILE TO THE ENEMY IT LOOKED AS THOUGH HIS WHOLE FORCE WAS BUT THE SKIRMISH LINE IN ADVANCE OF A REGIMENT THE SPANIARDS NATURALLY COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS THIN LINE WHICH SUDDENLY BROKE OUT OF THE BUSHES
5049-25947-0117 AND FROM BEHIND TREES AND CAME CHEERING OUT INTO THE HOT SUNLIGHT WAS THE ENTIRE FIGHTING FORCE AGAINST IT THEY SUPPOSED THE REGIMENT WAS COMING CLOSE ON ITS HEELS
5049-25947-0118 AND AS SPANISH TROOPS HATE BEING RUSHED AS A CAT HATES WATER THEY FIRED A FEW PARTING VOLLEYS AND BROKE AND RAN THE CHEERING HAD THE SAME INVIGORATING EFFECT ON OUR OWN SIDE AS A COLD SHOWER
5049-25947-0119 IT WAS WHAT FIRST TOLD HALF THE MEN WHERE THE OTHER HALF WERE AND IT MADE EVERY INDIVIDUAL MAN FEEL BETTER AS WE KNEW IT WAS ONLY A BLUFF THE FIRST CHEER WAS WAVERING
5049-25947-0120 WHEN WE FIRED A VOLLEY ONE OF THE PRISONERS SAID LATER INSTEAD OF FALLING BACK THEY CAME FORWARD THAT IS NOT THE WAY TO FIGHT TO COME CLOSER AT EVERY VOLLEY
5049-25947-0121 WHERE HE ANNOUNCED HE HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY THE ENTIRE AMERICAN ARMY ONE OF THE RESIDENTS OF SANTIAGO ASKED ONE OF THE SOLDIERS IF THOSE AMERICANS FOUGHT WELL WELL HE REPLIED
5049-25947-0122 STORMING A RIDGE EQUALLY WORTHY OF PRAISE BUT IT HAS SEEMED BETTER NOT TO TRY AND TELL OF ANYTHING I DID NOT SEE BUT TO LIMIT MYSELF TO THE WORK OF THE ROUGH RIDERS TO WHOM AFTER ALL THE VICTORY WAS DUE
5049-25947-0123 AS IT WAS OWING TO COLONEL WOOD'S CHARGE WHICH TOOK THE SPANIARDS IN FLANK THAT GENERAL WHEELER AND GENERAL YOUNG WERE ABLE TO ADVANCE
5049-25947-0124 OVER FOUR TIMES THEIR OWN NUMBER INTRENCHED BEHIND RIFLE PITS AND BUSHES IN A MOUNTAIN PASS IN SPITE OF THE SMOKELESS POWDER USED BY THE SPANIARDS
5049-25947-0125 THE ROUGH RIDERS ROUTED THEM OUT OF IT AND DROVE THEM BACK FROM THREE DIFFERENT BARRICADES UNTIL THEY MADE THEIR LAST STAND IN THE RUINED DISTILLERY WHENCE THEY FINALLY DROVE THEM BY ASSAULT
5049-25947-0126 THE EAGER SPIRIT IN WHICH THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED IS BEST DESCRIBED IN THE SPANISH SOLDIER'S ANSWER TO THE INQUIRING CIVILIAN THEY TRIED TO CATCH US WITH THEIR HANDS
5104-33406-0000 ALL THE FREEMEN IN THE WEST OF ICELAND HAD COME TO A MEETING HERE THEY MADE LAWS AND PUNISHED MEN FOR HAVING DONE WRONG THE MEETING WAS OVER NOW MEN WERE WALKING ABOUT THE PLAIN AND TALKING EVERYBODY SEEMED MUCH EXCITED
5104-33406-0001 VOICES WERE LOUD ARMS WERE SWINGING IT WAS AN UNJUST DECISION SOME ONE CRIED ERIC KILLED THE MEN IN FAIR FIGHT THE JUDGES OUTLAWED HIM BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID HIS FOE THORGEST HAS MANY RICH AND POWERFUL MEN TO BACK HIM
5104-33406-0002 NO NO SAID ANOTHER ERIC IS A BLOODY MAN I AM GLAD HE IS OUT OF ICELAND JUST THEN A BIG MAN WITH BUSHY RED HAIR AND BEARD STALKED THROUGH THE CROWD HE LOOKED STRAIGHT AHEAD AND SCOWLED
5104-33406-0003 THERE HE GOES PEOPLE SAID AND TURNED TO LOOK AFTER HIM HIS HANDS ARE AS RED AS HIS BEARD SOME SAID AND FROWNED BUT OTHERS LOOKED AT HIM AND SMILED SAYING HE WALKS LIKE THOR THE FEARLESS
5104-33406-0004 HIS STORY WOULD MAKE A FINE SONG ONE SAID AS STRONG AND AS BRAVE AND AS RED AS THOR ALWAYS IN A QUARREL A MAN OF MANY PLACES NORWAY THE NORTH OF ICELAND THE WEST OF ICELAND
5104-33406-0005 THOSE LITTLE ISLANDS OFF THE SHORE OF ICELAND OUTLAWED FROM ALL OF THEM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS QUARRELS WHERE WILL HE GO NOW I WONDER THIS ERIC STRODE DOWN TO THE SHORE WITH HIS MEN FOLLOWING HE IS IN A BLACK TEMPER THEY SAID
5104-33406-0006 WE SHOULD BEST NOT TALK TO HIM SO THEY MADE READY THE BOAT IN SILENCE ERIC GOT INTO THE PILOT'S SEAT AND THEY SAILED OFF SOON THEY PULLED THE SHIP UP ON THEIR OWN SHORE
5104-33406-0007 ERIC STROLLED INTO HIS HOUSE AND CALLED FOR SUPPER WHEN THE DRINKING HORNS HAD BEEN FILLED AND EMPTIED ERIC PULLED HIMSELF UP AND SMILED AND SHOUTED OUT SO THAT THE GREAT ROOM WAS FULL OF HIS BIG VOICE
5104-33406-0008 AND THERE IS ALWAYS A STORM ABOUT ME IT IS MY SWORD'S FAULT
5104-33406-0009 SHE HAS SHUT NORWAY TO ME AND NOW ICELAND WHERE WILL YOU GO NEXT OLD COMRADE AND HE PULLED OUT HIS SWORD AND LOOKED AT IT AND SMILED AS THE FIRE FLASHED ON IT
5104-33406-0010 THERE ARE SOME OF US WHO WILL FOLLOW YOU WHEREVER YOU GO ERIC CALLED A MAN FROM ACROSS THE FIRE IS IT SO ERIC CRIED LEAPING UP OH THEN WE SHALL HAVE SOME MERRY TIMES YET
5104-33406-0011 OUR SWORDS ARE SISTERS IN BLOOD AND WE ARE BROTHERS IN ADVENTURE DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS IN MY HEART TO DO HE JUMPED TO HIS FEET AND HIS FACE GLOWED THEN HE LAUGHED AS HE LOOKED AT HIS MEN
5104-33406-0012 I SEE THE ANSWER FLASHING FROM YOUR EYES HE SAID
5104-33406-0013 HIS MEN POUNDED ON THE TABLES AND SHOUTED YES YES ANYWHERE BEHIND ERIC
5104-33406-0014 ERIC LAUGHED DID YOU EVER HEAR THAT STORY THAT GUNNBIORN TOLD
5104-33406-0015 WHILE HE DRIFTED ABOUT HE SAW A STRANGE LAND THAT ROSE UP WHITE AND SHINING OUT OF A BLUE SEA HUGE SHIPS OF ICE SAILED OUT FROM IT AND MET HIM I MEAN TO SAIL TO THAT LAND
5104-33406-0016 A GREAT SHOUT WENT UP THAT SHOOK THE RAFTERS THEN THE MEN SAT AND TALKED OVER PLANS WHILE THEY SAT A STRANGER CAME INTO THE HALL I HAVE NO TIME TO DRINK HE SAID
5104-33406-0017 FOR HE LOVES YOU HUNTED LIKE A WOLF FROM CORNER TO CORNER OF THE WORLD ERIC CRIED ANGRILY WILL THEY NOT EVEN LET ME FINISH ONE FEAST THEN HE LAUGHED
5104-33406-0018 BUT IF I TAKE MY SPORT LIKE A WOLF I MUST BE HUNTED LIKE ONE
5104-33406-0019 WELL WE HAVE DONE IT BEFORE AND IT IS NO BAD PLACE CRIED SOME OF THE MEN I ALWAYS LIKED THE STARS BETTER THAN A SMOKY HOUSE FIRE SAID ONE
5104-33406-0020 CAN NO BAD FORTUNE SPOIL YOUR GOOD NATURE LAUGHED ERIC BUT NOW WE ARE OFF LET EVERY MAN CARRY WHAT HE CAN SO THEY QUICKLY LOADED THEMSELVES WITH CLOTHES AND GOLD AND SWORDS AND SPEARS AND KETTLES OF FOOD
5104-33406-0021 ERIC LED HIS WIFE THORHILD AND HIS TWO YOUNG SONS THORSTEIN AND LEIF
5104-33406-0022 FOR A WEEK OR MORE THEY STAYED IN HIS WOODS SOMETIMES IN A SECRET CAVE OF HIS WHEN THEY KNEW THAT THORGEST WAS ABOUT
5104-33406-0023 THORGEST IS OFF COME TO MY HOUSE FOR A FEAST ALL THIS TIME THEY WERE MAKING READY FOR THE VOYAGE REPAIRING THE SHIP AND FILLING IT WITH STORES WORD OF WHAT ERIC MEANT TO DO GOT OUT AND MEN LAUGHED AND SAID IS THAT NOT LIKE ERIC
5104-33406-0024 WHAT WILL HE NOT DO SOME MEN LIKED THE SOUND OF IT AND THEY CAME TO ERIC AND SAID WE WILL GO WITH YOU TO THIS STRANGE LAND SO ALL WERE READY AND THEY PUSHED OFF WITH ERIC'S FAMILY ABOARD AND THOSE FRIENDS WHO HAD JOINED HIM
5104-33406-0025 THEY TOOK HORSES AND CATTLE WITH THEM AND ALL KINDS OF TOOLS AND FOOD I DO NOT WELL KNOW WHERE THIS LAND IS ERIC SAID GUNNBIORN SAID ONLY THAT HE SAILED EAST WHEN HE CAME HOME TO ICELAND SO I WILL STEER STRAIGHT WEST
5104-33406-0026 WE SHALL SURELY FIND SOMETHING I DO NOT KNOW EITHER HOW LONG WE MUST GO SO THEY SAILED THAT STRANGE OCEAN NEVER DREAMING WHAT MIGHT BE AHEAD OF THEM THEY FOUND NO ISLANDS TO REST ON THEY MET HEAVY FOGS
5104-33406-0027 ONE DAY AS ERIC SAT IN THE PILOT'S SEAT HE SAID I THINK THAT I SEE ONE OF GUNNBIORN'S SHIPS OF ICE SHALL WE SAIL UP TO HER AND SEE WHAT KIND OF A CRAFT SHE IS YES SHOUTED HIS MEN
5104-33406-0028 IT SENDS OUT A COLD BREATH SAID ONE OF THE MEN THEY ALL WRAPPED THEIR CLOAKS ABOUT THEM IT IS A BIGGER BOAT THAN I EVER SAW BEFORE SAID ERIC THE WHITE MAST STANDS AS HIGH AS A HILL
5104-33406-0029 IT MUST BE GIANTS THAT SAIL IN IT FROST GIANTS SAID ANOTHER OF THE MEN BUT AS THEY CAME NEARER
5104-33406-0030 BY THOR THAT GUNNBIORN WAS A FOOLISH FELLOW WHY LOOK IT IS ONLY A PIECE OF FLOATING ICE SUCH AS WE SOMETIMES SEE FROM ICELAND IT IS NO SHIP AND THERE IS NO ONE ON IT
5104-33406-0031 HIS MEN LAUGHED AND ONE CALLED TO ANOTHER AND SAID AND YOU THOUGHT OF FROST GIANTS THEN THEY SAILED ON FOR DAYS AND DAYS THEY MET MANY OF THESE ICEBERGS ON ONE OF THEM WAS A WHITE BEAR
5104-33406-0032 YONDER IS A STRANGE PILOT ERIC LAUGHED I HAVE SEEN BEARS COME FLOATING SO TO THE NORTH SHORE OF ICELAND AN OLD MAN SAID PERHAPS THEY COME FROM THE LAND THAT WE ARE GOING TO FIND ONE DAY ERIC SAID
5104-33406-0033 IT IS CARRYING OUR SHIP AWAY FROM THIS LAND I CANNOT MAKE HEAD AGAINST IT OUT WITH THE OARS SO WITH OARS AND SAIL AND RUDDER THEY FOUGHT AGAINST THE CURRENT BUT IT TOOK THE BOAT ALONG LIKE A CHIP AND AFTER A WHILE THEY PUT UP THEIR OARS AND DRIFTED
5104-33406-0034 LUCK HAS TAKEN US INTO ITS OWN HANDS ERIC LAUGHED BUT THIS IS AS GOOD A WAY AS ANOTHER SOMETIMES THEY WERE NEAR ENOUGH TO SEE THE LAND
5104-33406-0035 PERHAPS THIS RIVER WILL CARRY US TO A WHIRLPOOL AND SUCK US UNDER THE MEN SAID BUT AT LAST ERIC FELT THE CURRENT LESS STRONG UNDER HIS HAND TO THE OARS AGAIN HE CALLED
5104-33406-0036 BUT WHEN THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY FOUND NO PLACE TO GO IN STEEP BLACK WALLS SHOT UP FROM THE SEA NOTHING GREW ON THEM WHEN THE MEN LOOKED ABOVE THE CLIFFS THEY SAW A LONG LINE OF WHITE CUTTING THE SKY IT IS A LAND OF ICE
5104-33406-0037 THEY SAID THEY SAILED ON SOUTH ALL THE TIME LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO GO ASHORE I AM SICK OF THIS ENDLESS SEA THORHILD COMPLAINED BUT THIS LAND IS WORSE
5104-33406-0038 AFTER A WHILE THEY BEGAN TO SEE SMALL BAYS CUT INTO THE SHORE WITH LITTLE FLAT PATCHES OF GREEN AT THEIR SIDES THEY LANDED IN THESE PLACES AND STRETCHED AND WARMED THEMSELVES AND ATE BUT THESE SPOTS ARE ONLY BIG ENOUGH FOR GRAVES
5104-33406-0039 THE MEN SAID WE CAN NOT LIVE HERE SO THEY WENT ON AGAIN ALL THE TIME THE WEATHER WAS GROWING COLDER ERIC'S PEOPLE KEPT THEMSELVES WRAPPED IN THEIR CLOAKS AND PUT SCARFS AROUND THEIR HEADS AND IT IS STILL SUMMER THORHILD SAID
5104-33406-0040 WHAT WILL IT BE IN WINTER WE MUST FIND A PLACE TO BUILD A HOUSE NOW BEFORE THE WINTER COMES ON SAID ERIC WE MUST NOT FREEZE HERE SO THEY CHOSE A LITTLE SPOT WITH HILLS ABOUT IT TO KEEP OFF THE WIND
5104-33406-0041 THEY MADE A HOUSE OUT OF STONES FOR THERE WERE MANY IN THAT PLACE THEY LIVED THERE THAT WINTER THE SEA FOR A LONG WAY OUT FROM SHORE FROZE SO THAT IT LOOKED LIKE WHITE LAND THE MEN WENT OUT UPON IT TO HUNT WHITE BEAR AND SEAL
5104-33406-0042 THEY ATE THE MEAT AND WORE THE SKINS TO KEEP THEM WARM THE HARDEST THING WAS TO GET FUEL FOR THE FIRE NO TREES GREW THERE THE MEN FOUND A LITTLE DRIFTWOOD ALONG THE SHORE
5104-33406-0043 SO THEY BURNED THE BONES AND THE FAT OF THE ANIMALS THEY KILLED IT IS A SICKENING SMELL THORHILD SAID I HAVE NOT BEEN OUT OF THIS MEAN HOUSE FOR WEEKS I AM TIRED OF THE DARKNESS AND THE SMOKE AND THE CATTLE
5104-33406-0044 AND ALL THE TIME I HEAR GREAT NOISES AS THOUGH SOME GIANT WERE BREAKING THIS LAND INTO PIECES AH CHEER UP GOOD WIFE ERIC LAUGHED I SMELL BETTER LUCK AHEAD
5104-33406-0045 ONCE ERIC AND HIS MEN CLIMBED THE CLIFFS AND WENT BACK INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE LAND WHEN THEY CAME HOME THEY HAD THIS TO TELL IT IS A COUNTRY OF ICE SHINING WHITE NOTHING GROWS ON IT BUT A FEW MOSSES
5104-33406-0046 FAR OFF IT LOOKS FLAT BUT WHEN YOU WALK UPON IT THERE ARE GREAT HOLES AND CRACKS WE COULD SEE NOTHING BEYOND THERE SEEMS TO BE ONLY A FRINGE OF LAND AROUND THE EDGE OF AN ISLAND OF ICE THE WINTER NIGHTS WERE VERY LONG
5104-33406-0047 SOMETIMES THE SUN SHOWED FOR AN HOUR SOMETIMES FOR ONLY A FEW MINUTES SOMETIMES IT DID NOT SHOW AT ALL FOR A WEEK THE MEN HUNTED BY THE BRIGHT SHINING OF THE MOON OR BY THE NORTHERN LIGHTS AS IT GREW WARMER
5104-33406-0048 THE ICE IN THE SEA BEGAN TO CRACK AND MOVE AND MELT AND FLOAT AWAY ERIC WAITED ONLY UNTIL THERE WAS A CLEAR PASSAGE IN THE WATER THEN HE LAUNCHED HIS BOAT AND THEY SAILED SOUTHWARD AGAIN AT LAST THEY FOUND A PLACE THAT ERIC LIKED
5104-33406-0049 HERE I WILL BUILD MY HOUSE HE SAID SO THEY DID AND LIVED THERE THAT SUMMER AND PASTURED THEIR CATTLE AND CUT HAY FOR THE WINTER AND FISHED AND HUNTED THE NEXT SPRING ERIC SAID THE LAND STRETCHES FAR NORTH
5104-33406-0050 I AM HUNGRY TO KNOW WHAT IS THERE THEN THEY ALL GOT INTO THE BOAT AGAIN AND SAILED NORTH WE CAN LEAVE NO ONE HERE ERIC HAD SAID WE CANNOT TELL WHAT MIGHT COME BETWEEN US PERHAPS GIANTS OR DRAGONS
5104-33406-0051 OR STRANGE MEN MIGHT COME OUT OF THIS INLAND ICE AND KILL OUR PEOPLE WE MUST STAY TOGETHER FARTHER NORTH THEY FOUND ONLY THE SAME BARE FROZEN COUNTRY SO AFTER A WHILE THEY SAILED BACK TO THEIR HOME AND LIVED THERE
5104-33406-0052 ONE SPRING AFTER THEY HAD BEEN IN THAT LAND FOR FOUR YEARS ERIC SAID MY EYES ARE HUNGRY FOR THE SIGHT OF MEN AND GREEN FIELDS AGAIN MY STOMACH IS SICK OF SEAL AND WHALE AND BEAR MY THROAT
5104-33406-0053 IS DRY FOR MEAD THIS IS A BARE AND COLD AND HUNGRY LAND I WILL VISIT MY FRIENDS IN ICELAND AND OUR SWORDS ARE RUSTY WITH LONG RESTING SAID HIS MEN PERHAPS WE CAN FIND PLAY FOR THEM IN ICELAND
5104-33406-0054 NOW I HAVE A PLAN ERIC SUDDENLY SAID WOULD IT NOT BE PLEASANT TO SEE OTHER FEAST HALLS AS WE SAIL ALONG THE COAST OH IT WOULD BE A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT HIS MEN SAID WELL SAID ERIC
5104-33406-0055 I AM GOING TO TRY TO BRING BACK SOME NEIGHBORS FROM ICELAND NOW WE MUST HAVE A NAME FOR OUR LAND HOW DOES GREENLAND SOUND HIS MEN LAUGHED AND SAID IT IS A VERY WHITE GREENLAND BUT MEN WILL LIKE THE SOUND OF IT
5104-33406-0056 IT IS BETTER THAN ICELAND SO ERIC AND ALL HIS PEOPLE SAILED BACK AND SPENT THE WINTER WITH HIS FRIENDS AH ERIC IT IS GOOD TO HEAR YOUR LAUGH AGAIN THEY SAID ERIC WAS AT MANY FEASTS AND SAW MANY MEN AND HE TALKED MUCH OF HIS GREENLAND
5104-33406-0057 THE SEA IS FULL OF WHALE AND SEALS AND GREAT FISH HE SAID THE LAND HAS BEAR AND REINDEER THERE ARE NO MEN THERE COME BACK WITH ME AND CHOOSE YOUR LAND
5104-33406-0058 SOME MEN WENT BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GREAT FROLIC TO GO TO A NEW COUNTRY SOME WENT BECAUSE THEY WERE POOR IN ICELAND AND THOUGHT I CAN BE NO WORSE OFF IN GREENLAND AND PERHAPS I SHALL GROW RICH THERE AND SOME WENT BECAUSE THEY LOVED ERIC
5104-33406-0059 AND WANTED TO BE HIS NEIGHBORS SO THE NEXT SUMMER THIRTY FIVE SHIPS FULL OF MEN AND WOMEN AND GOODS FOLLOWED ERIC FOR GREENLAND BUT THEY MET HEAVY STORMS AND SOME SHIPS WERE WRECKED AND THE MEN DROWNED
5104-33406-0060 OTHER MEN GREW HEARTSICK AT THE TERRIBLE STORM AND THE LONG VOYAGE AND NO SIGHT OF LAND AND THEY TURNED BACK TO ICELAND SO OF THOSE THIRTY FIVE SHIPS ONLY FIFTEEN GOT TO GREENLAND
5104-33406-0061 ONLY THE BRAVEST AND THE LUCKIEST MEN COME HERE ERIC SAID WE SHALL HAVE GOOD NEIGHBORS SOON OTHER HOUSES WERE BUILT ALONG THE FIORDS
5104-33407-0000 NOW ERIC HAD LIVED IN GREENLAND FOR FIFTEEN YEARS HIS SONS THORSTEIN AND LEIF HAD GROWN UP TO BE BIG STRONG MEN ONE SPRING LEIF SAID TO HIS FATHER I HAVE NEVER SEEN NORWAY OUR MOTHER LAND
5104-33407-0001 I LONG TO GO THERE AND MEET THE GREAT MEN AND SEE THE PLACES THAT SKALDS SING ABOUT ERIC ANSWERED IT IS RIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD GO NO MAN HAS REALLY LIVED UNTIL HE HAS SEEN NORWAY
5104-33407-0002 SO HE HELPED LEIF FIT OUT A BOAT AND SENT HIM OFF LEIF SAILED FOR MONTHS HE PASSED ICELAND AND THE FAROES AND THE SHETLANDS HE STOPPED AT ALL OF THESE PLACES AND FEASTED HIS MIND ON THE NEW THINGS
5104-33407-0003 AND EVERYWHERE MEN RECEIVED HIM GLADLY FOR HE WAS HANDSOME AND WISE BUT AT LAST HE CAME NEAR NORWAY THEN HE STOOD UP BEFORE THE PILOT'S SEAT AND SANG LOUDLY
5104-33407-0004 IN THE SKY ABOVE I SEE FAIR ASGARD'S SHINING ROOFS THE FLYING HAIR OF THOR THE WINGS OF ODIN'S BIRDS THE ROAD THAT HEROES TREAD I AM HERE IN THE LAND OF THE GODS THE LAND OF MIGHTY MEN
5104-33407-0005 FOR A WHILE HE WALKED THE LAND AS THOUGH HE WERE IN A DREAM HE LOOKED AT THIS AND THAT AND EVERYTHING
5104-33407-0006 I WILL GO TO THE KING HE SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN A KING THERE WERE NO KINGS IN ICELAND OR IN GREENLAND SO HE WENT TO THE CITY WHERE THE KING HAD HIS FINE HOUSE THE KING'S NAME WAS OLAF
5104-33407-0007 HE WAS A GREAT GRANDSON OF HARALD HAIRFAIR FOR HARALD HAD BEEN DEAD A HUNDRED YEARS NOW THE KING WAS GOING TO HOLD A FEAST AT NIGHT AND LEIF PUT ON HIS MOST BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES TO GO TO IT
5104-33407-0008 HE PUT ON LONG TIGHTS OF BLUE WOOL AND A SHORT JACKET OF BLUE VELVET HE BELTED HIS JACKET WITH A GOLD GIRDLE HE HAD SHOES OF SCARLET WITH GOLDEN CLASPS HE THREW AROUND HIMSELF A CAPE OF SCARLET VELVET
5104-33407-0009 LINED WITH SEAL FUR HIS LONG SWORD STUCK OUT FROM UNDER HIS CLOAK ON HIS HEAD HE PUT A KNITTED CAP OF BRIGHT COLORS THEN HE WALKED TO THE KING'S FEAST HALL AND WENT THROUGH THE DOOR
5104-33407-0010 IT WAS A GREAT HALL AND IT WAS FULL OF RICHLY DRESSED MEN THE FIRES SHONE ON SO MANY GOLDEN HEAD BANDS AND BRACELETS AND SO MANY GLITTERING SWORDS AND SPEARS ON THE WALL AND THERE WAS SO MUCH NOISE OF TALKING AND LAUGHING
5104-33407-0011 THAT AT FIRST LEIF DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO BUT AT LAST HE WENT AND SAT ON THE VERY END SEAT OF THE BENCH NEAR HIM AS THE FEAST WENT ON KING OLAF SAT IN HIS HIGH SEAT AND LOOKED ABOUT THE HALL AND NOTICED THIS ONE AND THAT ONE AND SPOKE ACROSS THE FIRE TO MANY
5104-33407-0012 HE WAS KEEN EYED AND SOON SAW LEIF IN HIS FAR SEAT YONDER IS SOME MAN OF MARK HE SAID TO HIMSELF HE IS SURELY WORTH KNOWING HIS FACE IS NOT THE FACE OF A FOOL
5104-33407-0013 HE CARRIES HIS HEAD LIKE A LORD OF MEN HE SENT A THRALL AND ASKED LEIF TO COME TO HIM SO LEIF WALKED DOWN THE LONG HALL AND STOOD BEFORE THE KING I AM GLAD TO HAVE YOU FOR A GUEST THE KING SAID

5104-33407-0015 MANY COME TO NORWAY TO TRADE BUT THEY SELDOM COME TO THE KING'S HALL I SHALL BE GLAD TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR LAND COME UP AND SPEAK WITH ME SO LEIF WENT UP THE STEPS OF THE HIGH SEAT AND SAT DOWN BY THE KING AND TALKED WITH HIM
5104-33407-0016 WHEN THE FEAST WAS OVER THE KING SAID YOU SHALL LIVE AT MY COURT THIS WINTER LEIF ERICSSON YOU ARE A WELCOME GUEST SO LEIF STAYED THERE THAT WINTER WHEN HE STARTED BACK IN THE SPRING
5104-33407-0017 THE KING GAVE HIM TWO THRALLS AS A PARTING GIFT LET THIS GIFT SHOW MY LOVE LEIF ERICSSON HE SAID FOR YOUR SAKE I SHALL NOT FORGET GREENLAND LEIF SAILED BACK AGAIN AND HAD GOOD LUCK UNTIL HE WAS PAST ICELAND
5104-33407-0018 THEN GREAT WINDS CAME OUT OF THE NORTH AND TOSSED HIS SHIP ABOUT SO THAT THE MEN COULD DO NOTHING THEY WERE BLOWN SOUTH FOR DAYS AND DAYS THEY DID NOT KNOW WHERE THEY WERE THEN THEY SAW LAND AND LEIF SAID
5104-33407-0019 SURELY LUCK HAS BROUGHT US ALSO TO A NEW COUNTRY
5104-33407-0020 SO HE STEERED FOR IT AS THEY CAME NEAR THE MEN SAID SEE THE GREAT TREES AND THE SOFT GREEN SHORE SURELY THIS IS A BETTER COUNTRY THAN GREENLAND OR THAN ICELAND EITHER
5104-33407-0021 WHEN THEY LANDED THEY THREW THEMSELVES UPON THE GROUND I NEVER LAY ON A BED SO SOFT AS THIS GRASS ONE SAID TALLER TREES DO NOT GROW IN NORWAY SAID ANOTHER
5104-33407-0022 THERE IS NO STONE HERE AS IN NORWAY BUT ONLY GOOD BLACK DIRT LEIF SAID I NEVER SAW SO FERTILE A LAND BEFORE THE MEN WERE HUNGRY AND SET ABOUT BUILDING A FIRE THERE IS NO LACK OF FUEL HERE
5104-33407-0023 THEY SAID THEY STAYED MANY DAYS IN THIS COUNTRY AND WALKED ABOUT TO SEE WHAT WAS THERE A GERMAN NAMED TYRKER WAS WITH LEIF HE WAS A LITTLE MAN WITH A HIGH FOREHEAD AND A SHORT NOSE HIS EYES WERE BIG AND ROLLING
5104-33407-0024 HE HAD LIVED WITH ERIC FOR MANY YEARS AND HAD TAKEN CARE OF LEIF WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY SO LEIF LOVED HIM NOW ONE DAY THEY HAD BEEN WANDERING ABOUT AND ALL CAME BACK TO CAMP AT NIGHT EXCEPT TYRKER WHEN LEIF LOOKED AROUND ON HIS COMRADES HE SAID
5104-33407-0025 WHERE IS TYRKER NO ONE KNEW THEN LEIF WAS ANGRY IS A MAN OF SO LITTLE VALUE IN THIS EMPTY LAND THAT YOU WOULD LOSE ONE HE SAID WHY DID YOU NOT KEEP TOGETHER DID YOU NOT SEE THAT HE WAS GONE
5104-33407-0026 WHY DID YOU NOT SET OUT TO LOOK FOR HIM WHO KNOWS WHAT TERRIBLE THING MAY HAVE HAPPENED TO HIM IN THESE GREAT FORESTS THEN HE TURNED AND STARTED OUT TO HUNT FOR HIM HIS MEN FOLLOWED SILENT AND ASHAMED
5104-33407-0027 AGAIN LEIF ASKED HIS QUESTION AND PUT HIS HAND ON TYRKER'S SHOULDER AS THOUGH HE WOULD SHAKE HIM THEN TYRKER ANSWERED IN THE LANGUAGE OF ICELAND I HAVE NOT BEEN SO VERY FAR BUT I HAVE FOUND SOMETHING WONDERFUL WHAT IS IT
5104-33407-0028 CRIED THE MEN I HAVE FOUND GRAPES GROWING WILD ANSWERED TYRKER AND HE LAUGHED AND HIS EYES SHONE IT CANNOT BE LEIF SAID GRAPES DO NOT GROW IN GREENLAND NOR IN ICELAND NOR EVEN IN NORWAY
5104-33407-0029 SO IT SEEMED A WONDERFUL THING TO THESE NORSEMEN CAN I NOT TELL GRAPES WHEN I SEE THEM CRIED TYRKER DID I NOT GROW UP IN GERMANY WHERE EVERY HILLSIDE IS COVERED WITH GRAPEVINES AH IT SEEMS LIKE MY OLD HOME
5104-33407-0030 IT IS WONDERFUL LEIF SAID I HAVE HEARD TRAVELERS TELL OF SEEING GRAPES GROWING BUT I MYSELF NEVER SAW IT YOU SHALL TAKE US TO THEM EARLY IN THE MORNING TYRKER SO IN THE MORNING THEY WENT BACK INTO THE WOODS AND SAW THE GRAPES
5104-33407-0031 THEY ATE OF THEM THEY ARE LIKE FOOD AND DRINK THEY CRIED THAT DAY LEIF SAID WE SPENT MOST OF THE SUMMER ON THE OCEAN WINTER WILL SOON BE COMING ON AND THE SEA ABOUT GREENLAND WILL BE FROZEN WE MUST START BACK
5104-33407-0032 WE WILL FILL THE ROWBOAT WITH GRAPES AND TOW IT BEHIND US THE SHIP WE WILL LOAD WITH LOGS FROM THESE GREAT TREES THAT WILL BE A WELCOME SHIPLOAD IN GREENLAND WHERE WE HAVE NEITHER TREES NOR VINES
5104-33407-0033 NOW HALF OF YOU SHALL GATHER GRAPES FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND THE OTHER HALF SHALL CUT TIMBER SO THEY DID AND AFTER A WEEK SAILED OFF THE SHIP WAS FULL OF LUMBER AND THEY TOWED THE ROWBOAT LOADED WITH GRAPES
5104-33407-0034 AS THEY LOOKED BACK AT THE SHORE LEIF SAID I WILL CALL THIS COUNTRY WINELAND FOR THE GRAPES THAT GROW THERE ONE OF THE MEN LEAPED UPON THE GUNWALE AND LEANED OUT CLINGING TO THE SAIL AND SANG
5104-33407-0035 WINELAND THE GREEN THE GREAT THE FAT OUR DRAGON FED AND CRAWLS AWAY WITH BELLY STUFFED AND LAZY FEET HOW LONG HER PURPLE TRAILING TAIL SHE FED AND GREW TO TWICE HER SIZE
5104-33407-0036 THEN ALL THE MEN WAVED THEIR HANDS TO THE SHORE AND GAVE A GREAT SHOUT FOR THAT GOOD LAND FOR ALL THAT VOYAGE THEY HAD FAIR WEATHER AND SAILED INTO ERIC'S HARBOR BEFORE THE WINTER CAME
5104-33407-0037 ERIC SAW THE SHIP AND RAN DOWN TO THE SHORE HE TOOK LEIF INTO HIS ARMS AND SAID OH MY SON MY OLD EYES ACHED TO SEE YOU I HUNGER TO HEAR OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN AND DONE
5104-33407-0038 LUCK HAS FOLLOWED ME ALL THE WAY SAID LEIF SEE WHAT I HAVE BROUGHT HOME THE GREENLANDERS LOOKED LUMBER LUMBER THEY CRIED OH IT IS BETTER STUFF THAN GOLD
5104-33407-0039 THEN THEY SAW THE GRAPES AND TASTED THEM SURELY YOU MUST HAVE PLUNDERED ASGARD THEY SAID SMACKING THEIR LIPS AT THE FEAST THAT NIGHT ERIC SAID LEIF SHALL SIT IN THE PLACE OF HONOR
5104-33407-0040 SO LEIF SAT IN THE HIGH SEAT OPPOSITE ERIC ALL MEN THOUGHT HIM A HANDSOME AND WISE MAN HE TOLD THEM OF THE STORM AND OF WINELAND NO MAN WOULD EVER NEED A CLOAK THERE THE SOIL IS RICHER THAN THE SOIL OF NORWAY
5104-33407-0041 GRAIN GROWS WILD AND YOU YOURSELVES SAW THE GRAPES THAT WE GOT FROM THERE THE FORESTS ARE WITHOUT END THE SEA IS FULL OF FISH THE GREENLANDERS LISTENED WITH OPEN MOUTHS TO ALL THIS
5104-33407-0042 LEIF NOTICED TWO STRANGERS AN OLD MAN WHO SAT AT ERIC'S SIDE AND A YOUNG WOMAN ON THE CROSS BENCH HE TURNED TO HIS BROTHER THORSTEIN WHO SAT NEXT TO HIM WHO ARE THESE STRANGERS HE ASKED
5104-33407-0043 THORBIORN AND HIS DAUGHTER GUDRID THORSTEIN ANSWERED THEY LANDED HERE THIS SPRING I NEVER SAW OUR FATHER MORE GLAD OF ANYTHING THAN TO SEE THIS THORBIORN THEY WERE FRIENDS BEFORE WE LEFT ICELAND
5104-33407-0044 WHEN THEY SAW EACH OTHER AGAIN THEY COULD NOT TALK ENOUGH OF OLD TIMES IN THE SPRING ERIC MEANS TO GIVE HIM A FARM UP THE FIORD A WAY IT SEEMS THAT THIS THORBIORN COMES OF A GOOD FAMILY THAT HAS BEEN RICH AND GREAT IN ICELAND FOR YEARS
5104-33407-0045 AND THORBIORN HIMSELF WAS RICH WHEN OUR FATHER KNEW HIM AND WAS MUCH HONORED BY ALL MEN BUT ILL LUCK CAME AND HE GREW POOR THIS HURT HIS PRIDE I WILL NOT STAY IN ICELAND AND BE A BEGGAR
5104-33407-0046 HE SAID TO HIMSELF I WILL NOT HAVE MEN LOOK AT ME AND SAY HE IS NOT WHAT HIS FATHER WAS I WILL GO TO MY FRIEND ERIC THE RED IN GREENLAND THEN HE GOT READY A GREAT FEAST AND INVITED ALL HIS FRIENDS
5104-33407-0047 IT WAS SUCH A FEAST AS HAD NOT BEEN IN ICELAND FOR YEARS THORBIORN SPENT ON IT ALL THE WEALTH THAT HE HAD LEFT FOR HE SAID TO HIMSELF I WILL NOT LEAVE IN SHAME MEN SHALL REMEMBER MY LAST FEAST
5104-33407-0048 AFTER THAT HE SET OUT AND CAME TO GREENLAND IS NOT GUDRID BEAUTIFUL AND SHE IS WISE I MEAN TO MARRY HER IF HER FATHER WILL PERMIT IT
5104-33407-0049 NOW LEIF SETTLED DOWN IN GREENLAND AND BECAME A GREAT MAN THERE HE WAS SO BUSY AND HE GREW SO RICH THAT HE DID NOT THINK OF GOING TO WINELAND AGAIN BUT PEOPLE COULD NOT FORGET HIS STORY
5163-18515-0000 WHEN THE BOAT WAS NEARING THE ISLAND OF MARKEN THE LITTLE YELLOW CHEESE HAD BEEN PRESENTED WITH ALL DUE FORMALITY TO ONE OF THE SAILORS WHO HAD BEEN SPECIALLY KIND IN THE MATTER OF SECURING GOOD SEATS FOR MISTER KING'S PARTY POLLY AND PHRONSIE HAVING HELD A WHISPERED CONFERENCE IN A RETIRED NOOK

5163-18515-0017 POLLY WAS ALREADY GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF HOLDING UP AN IMAGINARY APRON AND AT LAST THE LITTLE GIRL UNDERSTOOD BY GESTURES WHAT SHE COULD NOT POSSIBLY GET INTO HER HEAD BY WORDS SO SHE PICKED UP THE SKIRT OF HER GOWN IN HER STURDY LITTLE FISTS
5163-18515-0018 AND ONE TWO THREE CLINKING COINS FELL SAFELY INTO IT BUT THE BOYS RACING ALONG IN ADVANCE SOON DISCOVERED THIS SUCCESSFUL TRICK AND COMPLETELY SWARMED AROUND HER HOWLING DREADFULLY SO SHE HASTENED OFF

5163-18515-0025 MOURNED POLLY FOR I'M AFRAID SHE'LL KEEP AWAY FROM ME ALL THE WHILE WE'RE ON THIS ISLAND AND THEN I CAN'T GET A CHANCE TO GIVE HER MY KODAK AT ALL SHE HAD IT AT THE MODEL FARM
5163-18515-0026 SAID POLLY SUCH A LITTLE BIT OF A WHILE DOESN'T COUNT WELL LET US TAKE PICTURES AS FAST AS WE CAN SUGGESTED JASPER AND THEN WHEN WE DO COME UP WITH ADELA WHY YOU'LL HAVE YOURS DONE SO POLLY ROUSED OUT OF HER DEJECTION AND SET TO WORK
5163-18515-0027 AND PRESENTLY THE HAY MAKERS AND THE MARKEN BOYS AND GIRLS THE FUNNY LITTLE HOUSES THAT LOOKED AS IF THEY DROPPED DOWN PELLMELL FROM THE CLOUDS AND SETTLED WHERE THEY HAD DROPPED THE HIGH RIDGES ALONG WHICH THE MEN AND BOYS WALKING IN THEIR FULL BAGGY TROUSERS LOOKED AS IF THEY WERE BLOWN UP
5163-18515-0028 AND FORMED A DUTCH PERSPECTIVE PERFECTLY AWFUL ALL THESE QUEER DELIGHTFUL THINGS WERE PRESENTLY IMPRISONED IN THE TWO KODAKS JASPER LOOKED UP THERE THAT'S MY LAST PICTURE HE DECLARED AT ANY RATE FOR NOW
5163-18515-0029 POLLY RAN OFF A FEW STEPS AND SAT DOWN ON A LOG TO FOCUS THE MARKEN GIRLS HAPPENED TO LOOK UP AND IMMEDIATELY WHIRLED AROUND AND PRESENTED THEIR BACKS TO HER OH DEAR HOW HATEFUL SHE EXCLAIMED

5163-18515-0031 SO SHE WAS JUST GOING TO GET UP FROM HER LOG WHEN THE GIRLS THINKING FROM HER ATTITUDE THAT SHE HAD GIVEN UP THE IDEA OF TAKING A PICTURE OF THEM TURNED BACK TO THEIR WORK AS QUICK AS A FLASH POLLY FOCUSSED AGAIN AND WAS JUST TOUCHING THE BUTTON
5163-18515-0032 WHEN A HAND CAME IN FRONT OF HER KODAK AND SHE SAW THE GRINNING FACE OF A MARKEN GIRL UNDER ITS POT HOOK OF HAIR AND WITH THE LONG DANGLING CURL ON ONE SIDE
5163-18515-0033 AND DON'T YOU EVER DO THAT AGAIN AND THE HAND WAS WITHDRAWN AND THE GIRL CLATTERED OFF AS FAST AS SHE COULD RUN IN HER WOODEN SHOES I GOT THEM SAID POLLY RUNNING BACK IN TRIUMPH TO JASPER

5163-18515-0037 POURING THE COINS INTO THE MOTHER'S LAP WHERE THEY ROLLED UNDERNEATH THE FAT BABY
5163-18515-0038 SAID PHRONSIE AS POLLY AND JASPER RAN UP TO A DOORWAY THROUGH WHICH THEY COULD SEE THEIR PARTY PHRONSIE STOOD JUST INSIDE AND APPEARED TO BE WATCHING FOR THEM THERE'S A WOMAN HERE WHO'S BEEN SHOWING US THINGS
5163-18515-0039 THERE WAS MISSUS FISHER UP BY THE TINY WINDOW BENDING OVER AN OLD WOMAN WHO HAD SPREAD OUT IN HER LAP SOME WHITE EMBROIDERED GARMENTS WHILE A YOUNG WOMAN HOVERED NEAR SMILING AND BLUSHING AND VERY HAPPY AT ALL THIS NOTICE
5163-18515-0040 AND THE REST OF THE PARTY CROWDED UP AS CLOSE AS THEY COULD THEY ARE HER DAUGHTER'S WEDDING CLOTHES SAID MISSUS FISHER I DO BELIEVE FOR THE OLD WOMAN WAS WORKING FEARFULLY HARD TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND

5163-18515-0042 AND THEN DEVOTED HER WHOLE TIME AND ENERGY TO THE DISPLAY OF THE GARMENTS AND SHE EVEN LAUGHED ALOUD WHEN OLD MISTER KING PUT SOME COINS IN HER HARD HAND
5163-18515-0043 SHE CONFIDED TO JASPER WHEN ONCE OUT OF DOORS HOW ELSE COULD THEY BE PULLED SO TIGHT AND THEY LOOK AS HARD AS A DRUM I DIDN'T INVESTIGATE HE SAID LAUGHING I'LL LEAVE THAT TO YOU POLLY WELL IT'S FUNNY ANYWAY SHE SAID

5163-18515-0045 CONTINUED POLLY SQUINTING UP AT A CROOKED ROW ALL COLOURS GREEN STRIPES AND BLACK STRIPES AND O DEAR ME JASPER KING JUST LOOK AT PHRONSIE JASPER FOLLOWED THE DIRECTION OF POLLY'S FINGER
5163-18515-0046 THERE SAT PHRONSIE ON A GRASSY BANK A LITTLE ABOVE THEM WITH ONE OF THE FATTEST MARKEN BABIES IN HER LAP A VARIEGATED GROUP OF NATIVES WAS NEAR BY WATCHING HER INTENTLY
5163-18515-0047 SIGHED PHRONSIE GIVING MOTHERLY PATS TO THE STOUT LITTLE LEGS DANGLING DOWN FROM HER LAP COME CHILDREN GRANDPAPA EMERGED FROM THE LITTLE OLD HOUSE WE MUST HURRY ON ELSE WE SHA'N'T GET THROUGH THIS ISLAND COME PHRONSIE GOODNESS ME

5163-39921-0000 WHY MISTER CROPPER CHANGED HIS MIND WELL MISS MAXWELL HOW DID YOU GET ALONG TODAY ASKED MISTER BAXTER AFFABLY WHEN THE NEW TEACHER CAME TO THE TABLE SHE WAS A SLIGHT DARK GIRL RATHER PLAIN LOOKING
5163-39921-0001 BUT WITH A SMART ENERGETIC WAY MISTER BAXTER APPROVED OF HER HE LIKED HER STYLE AS HE WOULD HAVE SAID THE SUMMER TERM HAD JUST OPENED IN THE MAITLAND DISTRICT ESTHER MAXWELL WAS A STRANGER
5163-39921-0002 BUT SHE WAS A CAPABLE GIRL AND HAD NO DOUBT OF HER OWN ABILITY TO GET AND KEEP THE SCHOOL IN GOOD WORKING ORDER SHE SMILED BRIGHTLY AT MISTER BAXTER VERY WELL FOR A BEGINNING THE CHILDREN SEEM BRIGHT AND TEACHABLE
5163-39921-0003 AND NOT HARD TO CONTROL MISTER BAXTER NODDED THERE ARE NO BAD CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL EXCEPT THE CROPPER BOYS AND THEY CAN BE GOOD ENOUGH IF THEY LIKE RECKON THEY WEREN'T THERE TODAY NO
5163-39921-0004 WELL MISS MAXWELL I THINK IT ONLY FAIR TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY HAVE TROUBLE WITH THOSE BOYS WHEN THEY DO COME FOREWARNED IS FOREARMED YOU KNOW MISTER CROPPER WAS OPPOSED TO OUR HIRING YOU
5163-39921-0005 NOT OF COURSE THAT HE HAD ANY PERSONAL OBJECTION TO YOU BUT HE IS SET AGAINST FEMALE TEACHERS AND WHEN A CROPPER IS SET THERE IS NOTHING ON EARTH CAN CHANGE HIM HE SAYS FEMALE TEACHERS CAN'T KEEP ORDER
5163-39921-0006 THEY KNOW HE'LL BACK THEM UP IN SECRET NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO JUST TO PROVE HIS OPINIONS CROPPER IS SLY AND SLIPPERY AND IT IS HARD TO CORNER HIM ARE THE BOYS BIG QUERIED ESTHER ANXIOUSLY
5163-39921-0007 YES THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN AND BIG FOR THEIR AGE YOU CAN'T WHIP EM THAT IS THE TROUBLE A MAN MIGHT BUT THEY'D TWIST YOU AROUND THEIR FINGERS YOU'LL HAVE YOUR HANDS FULL I'M AFRAID
5163-39921-0008 BUT MAYBE THEY'LL BEHAVE ALL RIGHT AFTER ALL MISTER BAXTER PRIVATELY HAD NO HOPE THAT THEY WOULD BUT ESTHER HOPED FOR THE BEST SHE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT MISTER CROPPER WOULD CARRY HIS PREJUDICES INTO A PERSONAL APPLICATION
5163-39921-0009 THIS CONVICTION WAS STRENGTHENED WHEN HE OVERTOOK HER WALKING FROM SCHOOL THE NEXT DAY AND DROVE HER HOME HE WAS A BIG HANDSOME MAN WITH A VERY SUAVE POLITE MANNER HE ASKED INTERESTEDLY ABOUT HER SCHOOL AND HER WORK
5163-39921-0010 HOPED SHE WAS GETTING ON WELL AND SAID HE HAD TWO YOUNG RASCALS OF HIS OWN TO SEND SOON ESTHER FELT RELIEVED SHE THOUGHT THAT MISTER BAXTER HAD EXAGGERATED MATTERS A LITTLE THAT PLUM TREE OF MISSUS CHARLEY'S IS LOADED WITH FRUIT AGAIN THIS YEAR
5163-39921-0011 REMARKED MISTER BAXTER AT THE TEA TABLE THAT EVENING I CAME PAST IT TODAY ON MY WAY CROSS LOTS HOME FROM THE WOODS THERE WILL BE BUSHELS OF PLUMS ON IT
5163-39921-0012 I DON'T SUPPOSE POOR MISSUS CHARLEY WILL GET ONE OF THEM ANY MORE THAN SHE EVER HAS SAID MISSUS BAXTER INDIGNANTLY IT'S A BURNING SHAME THAT'S WHAT IT IS I JUST WISH SHE COULD CATCH THE CROPPERS ONCE
5163-39921-0013 YOU HAVEN'T ANY PROOF THAT IT IS REALLY THEM MARY OBJECTED HER HUSBAND AND YOU SHOULDN'T MAKE RECKLESS ACCUSATIONS BEFORE FOLKS I KNOW VERY WELL IT IS THEM
5163-39921-0014 AND MISSUS CHARLEY KNOWS IT TOO ALTHOUGH SHE CAN'T PROVE IT MORE'S THE PITY I DON'T SAY ISAAC CROPPER STEALS THOSE PLUMS WITH HIS OWN HANDS BUT HE KNOWS WHO DOES AND THE PLUMS GO INTO MEHITABLE CROPPER'S PRESERVING KETTLE
5163-39921-0015 THERE'S NOTHING SURER YOU SEE MISS MAXWELL IT'S THIS WAY EXPLAINED MISTER BAXTER TURNING TO ESTHER MISSUS CHARLEY CROPPER'S HUSBAND WAS ISAAC'S BROTHER
5163-39921-0016 THEY NEVER GOT ON WELL TOGETHER AND WHEN CHARLEY DIED THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS FUSS ABOUT THE PROPERTY ISAAC ACTED MEAN AND SCANDALOUS CLEAR THROUGH AND PUBLIC OPINION HAS BEEN DOWN ON HIM EVER SINCE
5163-39921-0017 BUT MISSUS CHARLEY IS A PRETTY SMART WOMAN AND HE DIDN'T GET THE BETTER OF HER IN EVERYTHING THERE WAS A STRIP OF DISPUTED LAND BETWEEN THE TWO FARMS AND SHE SECURED IT THERE'S A BIG PLUM TREE GROWING ON IT CLOSE TO THE LINE FENCE
5163-39921-0018 IT'S THE FINEST ONE IN MAITLAND BUT MISSUS CHARLEY NEVER GETS A PLUM FROM IT
5163-39921-0019 ASKED ESTHER THEY DISAPPEAR SAID MISTER BAXTER WITH A SIGNIFICANT NOD WHEN THE PLUMS ARE ANYTHING LIKE RIPE MISSUS CHARLEY DISCOVERS SOME DAY THAT THERE ISN'T ONE LEFT ON THE TREE
5163-39921-0020 SHE HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GET A SCRAP OF PROOF AS TO WHO TOOK THEM OR SHE'D MAKE IT HOT FOR THEM BUT NOBODY IN MAITLAND HAS ANY DOUBT IN HIS OWN MIND THAT ISAAC CROPPER KNOWS WHERE THOSE PLUMS GO
5163-39921-0021 I DON'T THINK MISTER CROPPER WOULD STEAL PROTESTED ESTHER WELL HE DOESN'T CONSIDER IT STEALING YOU KNOW HE CLAIMS THE LAND AND SAYS THE PLUMS ARE HIS
5163-39921-0022 I DON'T DOUBT THAT HE IS QUITE CLEAR IN HIS OWN MIND THAT THEY ARE AND HE DOES HATE MISSUS CHARLEY I'D GIVE CONSIDERABLE TO SEE THE OLD SINNER FAIRLY CAUGHT BUT HE IS TOO DEEP
5163-39921-0023 I THINK MISTER BAXTER IS TOO HARD ON MISTER CROPPER SAID ESTHER TO HERSELF LATER ON HE HAS PROBABLY SOME PRIVATE PREJUDICE AGAINST HIM BUT A MONTH LATER SHE HAD CHANGED HER OPINION
5163-39921-0024 DURING THAT TIME THE CROPPER BOYS HAD COME TO SCHOOL AT FIRST ESTHER HAD BEEN INCLINED TO LIKE THEM THEY WERE HANDSOME LADS WITH THE SAME SMOOTH WAY THAT CHARACTERIZED THEIR FATHER AND SEEMED BRIGHT AND INTELLIGENT
5163-39921-0025 FOR A FEW DAYS ALL WENT WELL AND ESTHER FELT DECIDEDLY RELIEVED BUT BEFORE LONG A SUBTLE SPIRIT OF INSUBORDINATION BEGAN TO MAKE ITSELF FELT IN THE SCHOOL ESTHER FOUND HERSELF POWERLESS TO COPE WITH IT
5163-39921-0026 THE CROPPERS NEVER OPENLY DEFIED HER BUT THEY DID PRECISELY AS THEY PLEASED THE OTHER PUPILS THOUGHT THEMSELVES AT LIBERTY TO FOLLOW THIS EXAMPLE AND IN A MONTH'S TIME POOR ESTHER HAD COMPLETELY LOST CONTROL OF HER LITTLE KINGDOM
5163-39921-0027 SOME COMPLAINTS WERE HEARD AMONG THE RATEPAYERS AND EVEN MISTER BAXTER LOOKED DUBIOUS SHE KNEW THAT UNLESS SHE COULD REGAIN HER AUTHORITY SHE WOULD BE REQUESTED TO HAND IN HER RESIGNATION
5163-39921-0028 BUT SHE WAS BAFFLED BY THE ELUSIVE SYSTEM OF DEFIANCE WHICH THE CROPPER BOYS HAD ORGANIZED ONE DAY SHE RESOLVED TO GO TO MISTER CROPPER HIMSELF AND APPEAL TO HIS SENSE OF JUSTICE IF HE HAD ANY
5163-39921-0029 IT HAD BEEN AN ESPECIALLY HARD DAY IN SCHOOL WHEN SHE HAD BEEN ABSENT AT THE NOON HOUR ALL THE DESKS IN THE SCHOOLROOM HAD BEEN PILED IN A PYRAMID ON THE FLOOR BOOKS AND SLATES INTERCHANGED AND VARIOUS OTHER PRANKS PLAYED
5163-39921-0030 WHEN QUESTIONED EVERY PUPIL DENIED HAVING DONE OR HELPED TO DO IT ALFRED AND BOB CROPPER LOOKED HER SQUARELY IN THE EYES AND DECLARED THEIR INNOCENCE IN THEIR USUAL GENTLEMANLY FASHION YET ESTHER FELT SURE THAT THEY WERE THE GUILTY ONES
5163-39921-0031 SHE ALSO KNEW WHAT EXAGGERATED ACCOUNTS OF THE AFFAIR WOULD BE TAKEN HOME TO MAITLAND TEA TABLES AND SHE FELT LIKE SITTING DOWN TO CRY BUT SHE DID NOT INSTEAD SHE SET HER MOUTH FIRMLY HELPED THE CHILDREN RESTORE THE ROOM TO ORDER
5163-39921-0032 AND AFTER SCHOOL WENT UP TO ISAAC CROPPER'S HOUSE THAT GENTLEMAN HIMSELF CAME IN FROM THE HARVEST FIELD LOOKING AS COURTLY AS USUAL EVEN IN HIS ROUGH WORKING CLOTHES HE SHOOK HANDS HEARTILY TOLD HER HE WAS GLAD TO SEE HER
5163-39921-0033 AND BEGAN TALKING ABOUT THE WEATHER ESTHER WAS NOT TO BE TURNED FROM HER OBJECT THUS ALTHOUGH SHE FELT HER COURAGE EBBING AWAY FROM HER AS IT ALWAYS DID IN THE PRESENCE OF THE CROPPER IMPERVIOUSNESS
5163-39921-0034 I HAVE COME UP TO SEE YOU ABOUT ALFRED AND ROBERT MISTER CROPPER SHE SAID THEY ARE NOT BEHAVING WELL IN SCHOOL INDEED MISTER CROPPER'S VOICE EXPRESSED BLAND SURPRISE THAT IS STRANGE
5163-39921-0035 AS A RULE I DO NOT THINK ALFRED AND ROBERT HAVE BEEN TROUBLESOME TO THEIR TEACHERS WHAT HAVE THEY BEEN DOING NOW THEY REFUSE TO OBEY MY ORDERS SAID ESTHER FAINTLY
5163-39921-0036 MY BOYS ARE HIGH SPIRITED FELLOWS AND NEED A STRONG FIRM HAND TO RESTRAIN THEM I HAVE ALWAYS SAID I CONSIDERED IT ADVISABLE TO EMPLOY A MALE TEACHER IN MAITLAND SCHOOL WE SHOULD HAVE BETTER ORDER
5163-39921-0037 NOT THAT I DISAPPROVE OF YOU PERSONALLY FAR FROM IT I SHOULD BE GLAD TO SEE YOU SUCCEED BUT I HAVE HEARD MANY COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE ORDER IN SCHOOL AT PRESENT I HAD NO TROUBLE UNTIL YOUR BOYS CAME
5163-39921-0038 RETORTED ESTHER LOSING HER TEMPER A LITTLE AND I BELIEVE THAT IF YOU WERE WILLING TO CO OPERATE WITH ME THAT I COULD GOVERN THEM WELL YOU SEE SAID MISTER CROPPER EASILY
5163-39921-0039 WHEN I SEND MY BOYS TO SCHOOL I NATURALLY EXPECT THAT THE TEACHER WILL BE CAPABLE OF DOING THE WORK SHE HAS BEEN HIRED TO DO THEN YOU REFUSE TO HELP ME SAID ESTHER IN A TREMBLING VOICE
5163-39921-0040 WHY MY DEAR YOUNG LADY WHAT CAN I DO BOYS SOON KNOW WHEN THEY CAN DISOBEY A TEACHER WITH IMPUNITY NO DOUBT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SECURE A SCHOOL EASIER TO CONTROL AND WILL DO GOOD WORK
5163-39921-0041 BUT HERE AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID WE NEED A FIRM HAND AT THE HELM BUT YOU ARE NOT GOING YET MISS MAXWELL YOU NEED SOME REFRESHMENT AFTER YOUR LONG WALK MISSUS CROPPER WILL BRING YOU IN SOMETHING NO THANK YOU SAID POOR ESTHER
5163-39921-0042 SHE FELT THAT SHE MUST GET AWAY AT ONCE OR SHE WOULD BURST INTO HEARTSICK TEARS UNDER THOSE STEELY BLAND BLUE EYES WHEN SHE GOT HOME SHE SHUT HERSELF UP IN HER ROOM AND CRIED THERE WAS NOTHING FOR HER TO DO BUT RESIGN SHE THOUGHT DISMALLY
5163-39921-0043 ON THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY ESTHER WENT FOR AN AFTERNOON WALK CARRYING HER KODAK WITH HER IT WAS A BRILLIANTLY FINE AUTUMN DAY AND WOODS AND FIELDS WERE BASKING IN A MELLOW HAZE ESTHER WENT ACROSS LOTS TO MISSUS CHARLEY CROPPER'S HOUSE INTENDING TO MAKE A CALL
5163-39921-0044 BUT THE HOUSE WAS LOCKED UP AND EVIDENTLY DESERTED SO SHE RAMBLED PAST IT TO THE BACK FIELDS PASSING THROUGH A GROVE OF MAPLES SHE CAME OUT AMONG LEAFY YOUNG SAPLINGS ON THE OTHER SIDE JUST BEYOND HER WITH ITS LADEN BOUGHS HANGING OVER THE LINE FENCE
5163-39921-0045 WAS THE FAMOUS PLUM TREE ESTHER LOOKED AT IT FOR A MOMENT THEN AN ODD SMILE GLEAMED OVER HER FACE AND SHE LIFTED HER KODAK MONDAY EVENING ESTHER CALLED ON MISTER CROPPER AGAIN
5163-39921-0046 AFTER THE PRELIMINARY REMARKS IN WHICH HE INDULGED SHE SAID WITH SEEMING IRRELEVANCE THAT SATURDAY HAD BEEN A FINE DAY THERE WAS AN EXCELLENT LIGHT FOR SNAPSHOTS SHE WENT ON COOLLY
5163-39921-0047 I HAVE BROUGHT YOU UP A PROOF I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE INTERESTED IN IT SHE ROSE AND PLACED THE PROOF ON THE TABLE BEFORE MISTER CROPPER THE PLUM TREE CAME OUT CLEARLY
5163-39921-0048 BOB AND ALF CROPPER WERE UP AMONG THE BOUGHS PICKING THE PLUMS ON THE GROUND BENEATH THEM STOOD THEIR FATHER WITH A BASKET OF FRUIT IN HIS HAND MISTER CROPPER LOOKED AT THE PROOF AND FROM IT TO ESTHER
5163-39921-0049 HIS EYES HAD LOST THEIR UNCONCERNED GLITTER BUT HIS VOICE WAS DEFIANT THE PLUMS ARE MINE BY RIGHT HE SAID PERHAPS SAID ESTHER CALMLY BUT THERE ARE SOME WHO DO NOT THINK SO
5163-39921-0050 MISSUS CHARLEY FOR INSTANCE SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS PROOF I THINK DON'T SHOW IT TO HER CRIED MISTER CROPPER HASTILY I TELL YOU MISS MAXWELL THE PLUMS ARE MINE BUT I AM TIRED OF FIGHTING OVER THEM
5163-39921-0051 AND I HAD DECIDED BEFORE THIS THAT I'D LET HER HAVE THEM AFTER THIS IT'S ONLY A TRIFLE ANYHOW AND ABOUT THAT LITTLE MATTER WE WERE DISCUSSING THE OTHER NIGHT MISS MAXWELL I HAVE BEEN THINKING IT OVER AND
5163-39921-0052 I ADMIT I WAS SOMEWHAT UNREASONABLE I'LL TALK TO ALFRED AND ROBERT AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO VERY WELL SAID ESTHER QUIETLY THE MATTER OF THE PLUMS ISN'T MY BUSINESS
5163-39921-0053 AND I DON'T WISH TO BE INVOLVED IN YOUR FAMILY FEUDS ESPECIALLY AS YOU SAY THAT YOU MEAN TO ALLOW MISSUS CHARLEY TO ENJOY HER OWN IN FUTURE AS FOR THE SCHOOL WE WILL HOPE THAT MATTERS WILL IMPROVE
5163-39921-0054 YOU'LL LEAVE THE PROOF WITH ME WON'T YOU SAID MISTER CROPPER EAGERLY OH CERTAINLY SAID ESTHER SMILING I HAVE THE NEGATIVE STILL YOU KNOW FROM THAT TIME OUT THE CROPPER BOYS WERE MODELS OF GOOD BEHAVIOUR AND THE OTHER TURBULENT SPIRITS
5163-39921-0055 HAVING LOST THEIR LEADERS WERE SOON QUELLED COMPLAINT DIED AWAY AND AT THE END OF THE TERM ESTHER WAS RE ENGAGED YOU SEEM TO HAVE WON OLD CROPPER OVER TO YOUR SIDE ENTIRELY MISTER BAXTER TOLD HER THAT NIGHT
5163-39921-0056 I NEVER KNEW ISAAC CROPPER TO CHANGE HIS OPINIONS SO HANDSOMELY ESTHER SMILED
5192-19396-0000 THE FATES WHO CERTAINLY ALL FORE KNEW OF THESE AMOURS OF WIDOW WADMAN AND MY UNCLE TOBY HAD FROM THE FIRST CREATION OF MATTER AND MOTION AND WITH MORE COURTESY THAN THEY USUALLY DO THINGS OF THIS KIND ESTABLISHED SUCH A CHAIN OF CAUSES AND EFFECTS HANGING SO FAST TO ONE ANOTHER
5192-19396-0001 THAT IT WAS SCARCE POSSIBLE FOR MY UNCLE TOBY TO HAVE DWELT IN ANY OTHER HOUSE IN THE WORLD OR TO HAVE OCCUPIED ANY OTHER GARDEN IN CHRISTENDOM BUT THE VERY HOUSE AND GARDEN WHICH JOIN'D AND LAID PARALLEL TO MISSUS WADMAN'S THIS WITH THE ADVANTAGE OF A THICKSET
5192-19396-0002 ARBOUR IN MISSUS WADMAN'S GARDEN BUT PLANTED IN THE HEDGE ROW OF MY UNCLE TOBY'S PUT ALL THE OCCASIONS INTO HER HANDS WHICH LOVE MILITANCY WANTED SHE COULD OBSERVE MY UNCLE TOBY'S MOTIONS
5192-19396-0003 QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY INTERRUPTING HIM AS HE MENTIONED THE BLIND GUT IN A DISCOURSE WITH MY FATHER THE NIGHT MY MOTHER WAS BROUGHT TO BED OF ME I BESEECH YOU QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY TO TELL ME WHICH IS THE BLIND GUT FOR OLD AS I AM I VOW I DO NOT KNOW TO THIS DAY WHERE IT LIES
5192-19396-0004 THE BLIND GUT ANSWERED DOCTOR SLOP LIES BETWIXT THE ILION AND COLON IN A MAN SAID MY FATHER
5192-19396-0005 IN A WOMAN THAT'S MORE THAN I KNOW QUOTH MY FATHER
5192-19396-0006 NEITHER AT THIS END OR THAT BUT LIKE A PRODIGAL'S CANDLE TO LIGHT HIM IF POSSIBLE AT BOTH ENDS AT ONCE NOW THROUGH ALL THE LUMBER ROOMS OF MILITARY FURNITURE INCLUDING BOTH OF HORSE AND FOOT
5192-19396-0007 AND WITH BRIDGET TO HELP HER SHE COULD NOT HAVE FOUND ANY ONE BLIND OR MANTELET SO FIT FOR HER PURPOSE AS THAT WHICH THE EXPEDIENCY OF MY UNCLE TOBY'S AFFAIRS HAD FIX'D UP READY TO HER HANDS I BELIEVE I HAVE NOT TOLD YOU BUT I DON'T KNOW POSSIBLY I HAVE BE IT AS IT WILL
5192-19396-0008 TIS ONE OF THE NUMBER OF THOSE MANY THINGS WHICH A MAN HAD BETTER DO OVER AGAIN THAN DISPUTE ABOUT IT THAT WHATEVER TOWN OR FORTRESS THE CORPORAL WAS AT WORK UPON DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR CAMPAIGN MY UNCLE TOBY ALWAYS TOOK CARE ON THE INSIDE OF HIS SENTRY BOX
5192-19396-0009 WHICH WAS TOWARDS HIS LEFT HAND TO HAVE A PLAN OF THE PLACE FASTEN'D UP WITH TWO OR THREE PINS AT THE TOP BUT LOOSE AT THE BOTTOM
5192-19396-0010 SO THAT WHEN AN ATTACK WAS RESOLVED UPON MISSUS WADMAN HAD NOTHING MORE TO DO WHEN SHE HAD GOT ADVANCED TO THE DOOR OF THE SENTRY BOX BUT TO EXTEND HER RIGHT HAND
5192-19396-0011 TO TAKE HOLD OF THE MAP OR PLAN OR UPRIGHT OR WHATEVER IT WAS AND WITH OUT STRETCHED NECK MEETING IT HALF WAY TO ADVANCE IT TOWARDS HER ON WHICH MY UNCLE TOBY'S PASSIONS WERE SURE TO CATCH FIRE FOR HE WOULD INSTANTLY TAKE HOLD OF THE OTHER CORNER OF THE MAP IN HIS LEFT HAND
5192-19396-0012 AND WITH THE END OF HIS PIPE IN THE OTHER BEGIN AN EXPLANATION WHEN THE ATTACK WAS ADVANCED TO THIS POINT THE WORLD WILL NATURALLY ENTER INTO THE REASONS OF MISSUS WADMAN'S NEXT STROKE OF GENERALSHIP WHICH WAS TO TAKE MY UNCLE TOBY'S TOBACCO PIPE OUT OF HIS HAND AS SOON AS SHE POSSIBLY COULD WHICH
5192-19396-0013 UNDER ONE PRETENCE OR OTHER BUT GENERALLY THAT OF POINTING MORE DISTINCTLY AT SOME REDOUBT OR BREASTWORK IN THE MAP SHE WOULD EFFECT BEFORE MY UNCLE TOBY POOR SOUL HAD WELL MARCH'D ABOVE HALF A DOZEN TOISES WITH IT IT OBLIGED MY UNCLE TOBY TO MAKE USE OF HIS FOREFINGER
5192-19396-0014 THE DIFFERENCE IT MADE IN THE ATTACK WAS THIS THAT IN GOING UPON IT AS IN THE FIRST CASE WITH THE END OF HER FORE FINGER AGAINST THE END OF MY UNCLE TOBY'S TOBACCO PIPE SHE MIGHT HAVE TRAVELLED WITH IT ALONG THE LINES FROM DAN TO BEERSHEBA HAD MY UNCLE TOBY'S LINES REACH'D SO FAR
5192-19396-0015 WITHOUT ANY EFFECT FOR AS THERE WAS NO ARTERIAL OR VITAL HEAT IN THE END OF THE TOBACCO PIPE IT COULD EXCITE NO SENTIMENT IT COULD NEITHER GIVE FIRE BY PULSATION OR RECEIVE IT BY SYMPATHY
5192-19396-0016 WHEREAS IN FOLLOWING MY UNCLE TOBY'S FOREFINGER WITH HERS CLOSE THRO ALL THE LITTLE TURNS AND INDENTINGS OF HIS WORKS PRESSING SOMETIMES AGAINST THE SIDE OF IT THEN TREADING UPON ITS NAIL THEN TRIPPING IT UP THEN TOUCHING IT HERE THEN THERE AND SO ON
5192-19396-0017 IT SET SOMETHING AT LEAST IN MOTION THIS THO SLIGHT SKIRMISHING AND AT A DISTANCE FROM THE MAIN BODY YET DREW ON THE REST FOR HERE THE MAP USUALLY FALLING WITH THE BACK OF IT CLOSE TO THE SIDE OF THE SENTRY BOX MY UNCLE TOBY
5192-19396-0018 IN THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS SOUL WOULD LAY HIS HAND FLAT UPON IT IN ORDER TO GO ON WITH HIS EXPLANATION AND MISSUS WADMAN BY A MANOEUVRE AS QUICK AS THOUGHT WOULD AS CERTAINLY PLACE HER'S CLOSE BESIDE IT THIS AT ONCE OPENED A COMMUNICATION
5192-19396-0019 LARGE ENOUGH FOR ANY SENTIMENT TO PASS OR RE PASS WHICH A PERSON SKILL'D IN THE ELEMENTARY AND PRACTICAL PART OF LOVE MAKING HAS OCCASION FOR BY BRINGING UP HER FOREFINGER PARALLEL AS BEFORE TO MY UNCLE TOBY'S IT UNAVOIDABLY BROUGHT THE THUMB INTO ACTION
5192-19396-0020 AND THE FOREFINGER AND THUMB BEING ONCE ENGAGED AS NATURALLY BROUGHT IN THE WHOLE HAND THINE DEAR UNCLE TOBY
5192-19396-0021 MISSUS WADMAN HAD IT EVER TO TAKE UP OR WITH THE GENTLEST PUSHINGS PROTRUSIONS AND EQUIVOCAL COMPRESSIONS THAT A HAND TO BE REMOVED IS CAPABLE OF RECEIVING TO GET IT PRESS'D A HAIR BREADTH OF ONE SIDE OUT OF HER WAY
5192-19396-0022 WHILST THIS WAS DOING HOW COULD SHE FORGET TO MAKE HIM SENSIBLE
5192-19396-0023 WHICH SLIGHTLY PRESS'D AGAINST THE CALF OF HIS
5192-19396-0024 WAS IT A WONDER IF NOW AND THEN IT PUT HIS CENTRE INTO DISORDER THE DUCE TAKE IT SAID MY UNCLE TOBY
5192-19396-0025 YOU WILL READILY CONCEIVE TO BE OF DIFFERENT KINDS VARYING FROM EACH OTHER LIKE THE ATTACKS WHICH HISTORY IS FULL OF AND FROM THE SAME REASONS A GENERAL LOOKER ON WOULD SCARCE ALLOW THEM TO BE ATTACKS AT ALL OR IF HE DID WOULD CONFOUND THEM ALL TOGETHER BUT I WRITE NOT TO THEM
5192-19396-0026 IT WILL BE TIME ENOUGH TO BE A LITTLE MORE EXACT IN MY DESCRIPTIONS OF THEM AS I COME UP TO THEM WHICH WILL NOT BE FOR SOME CHAPTERS HAVING NOTHING MORE TO ADD IN THIS BUT THAT IN A BUNDLE OF ORIGINAL PAPERS AND DRAWINGS WHICH MY FATHER TOOK CARE TO ROLL UP BY THEMSELVES
5192-19396-0027 THERE IS A PLAN OF BOUCHAIN IN PERFECT PRESERVATION AND SHALL BE KEPT SO WHILST I HAVE POWER TO PRESERVE ANY THING UPON THE LOWER CORNER OF WHICH ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE THERE IS STILL REMAINING THE MARKS OF A SNUFFY FINGER AND THUMB
5192-19396-0028 WHICH THERE IS ALL THE REASON IN THE WORLD TO IMAGINE WERE MISSUS WADMAN'S FOR THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE MARGIN WHICH I SUPPOSE TO HAVE BEEN MY UNCLE TOBY'S IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAN THIS SEEMS AN AUTHENTICATED RECORD OF ONE OF THESE ATTACKS
5192-19396-0029 BUT STILL VISIBLE ON THE OPPOSITE CORNER OF THE MAP WHICH ARE UNQUESTIONABLY THE VERY HOLES THROUGH WHICH IT HAS BEEN PRICKED UP IN THE SENTRY BOX BY ALL THAT IS PRIESTLY I VALUE THIS PRECIOUS RELICK WITH ITS STIGMATA AND PRICKS MORE THAN ALL THE RELICKS OF THE ROMISH CHURCH
5192-19396-0030 ALWAYS EXCEPTING WHEN I AM WRITING UPON THESE MATTERS THE PRICKS WHICH ENTERED THE FLESH OF SAINT RADAGUNDA IN THE DESERT WHICH IN YOUR ROAD FROM FESSE TO CLUNY THE NUNS OF THAT NAME WILL SHEW YOU FOR LOVE
5192-19396-0031 THE FORTIFICATIONS ARE QUITE DESTROYED
5192-19396-0032 I THINK SO TOO REPLIED MY UNCLE TOBY WITH A SIGH HALF SUPPRESS'D BUT STEP INTO THE PARLOUR TRIM FOR THE STIPULATION IT LIES UPON THE TABLE IT HAS LAIN THERE THESE SIX WEEKS REPLIED THE CORPORAL TILL THIS VERY MORNING THAT THE OLD WOMAN KINDLED THE FIRE WITH IT

5192-19397-0011 BUT WILL SUIT YOUR HONOUR EXACTLY THEN I'LL THANK THEE FOR IT WITH ALL MY HEART CRIED MY UNCLE TOBY SO PRITHEE BEGIN IT TRIM THE CORPORAL MADE HIS REVERENCE AND THOUGH IT IS NOT SO EASY A MATTER AS THE WORLD IMAGINES TO PULL OFF A LANK MONTERO CAP
5192-19397-0012 WITH GRACE OR A WHIT LESS DIFFICULT IN MY CONCEPTIONS WHEN A MAN IS SITTING SQUAT UPON THE GROUND TO MAKE A BOW SO TEEMING WITH RESPECT AS THE CORPORAL WAS WONT
5192-19397-0013 WHICH WAS TOWARDS HIS MASTER TO SLIP BACKWARDS UPON THE GRASS A LITTLE BEYOND HIS BODY IN ORDER TO ALLOW IT THE GREATER SWEEP AND BY AN UNFORCED COMPRESSION AT THE SAME TIME OF HIS CAP WITH THE THUMB AND THE TWO FOREFINGERS OF HIS LEFT BY WHICH THE DIAMETER
5192-19397-0014 OF THE CAP BECAME REDUCED SO THAT IT MIGHT BE SAID RATHER TO BE INSENSIBLY SQUEEZ'D THAN PULL'D OFF WITH A FLATUS THE CORPORAL ACQUITTED HIMSELF OF BOTH IN A BETTER MANNER THAN THE POSTURE OF HIS AFFAIRS PROMISED AND HAVING HEMMED TWICE
5192-19397-0015 TO FIND IN WHAT KEY HIS STORY WOULD BEST GO AND BEST SUIT HIS MASTER'S HUMOUR HE EXCHANGED A SINGLE LOOK OF KINDNESS WITH HIM AND SET OFF THUS THE STORY OF THE KING OF BOHEMIA AND HIS SEVEN CASTLES THERE WAS A CERTAIN KING OF BO

5192-19397-0017 SO THAT BEFORE THE CORPORAL HAD WELL GOT THROUGH THE FIRST FIVE WORDS OF HIS STORY HAD MY UNCLE TOBY TWICE TOUCH'D HIS MONTERO CAP WITH THE END OF HIS CANE INTERROGATIVELY AS MUCH AS TO SAY WHY DON'T YOU PUT IT ON TRIM TRIM TOOK IT UP WITH THE MOST RESPECTFUL SLOWNESS

5192-19397-0021 WITHOUT FURTHER ATTEMPTING IT HE PUT IT ON AND PASSING HIS HAND ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD TO RUB OUT A PENSIVE WRINKLE WHICH THE TEXT AND THE DOCTRINE BETWEEN THEM HAD ENGENDER'D HE RETURN'D WITH THE SAME LOOK AND TONE OF VOICE TO HIS STORY OF THE KING OF BOHEMIA AND HIS SEVEN CASTLES

5192-19397-0065 AND LESS TO EXPLAIN IT AND LEAST OF ALL TO TWIST HIS TALE LIKE MEN OF LORE TO SERVE A SYSTEM HE LOOKED UP IN MY UNCLE TOBY'S FACE FOR ASSISTANCE BUT SEEING IT WAS THE VERY THING MY UNCLE TOBY SAT IN EXPECTATION OF HIMSELF AFTER A HUM AND A HAW HE WENT ON

5192-19397-0079 GALLANT MORTAL CRIED MY UNCLE TOBY CAUGHT UP WITH ENTHUSIASM THIS MOMENT NOW THAT ALL IS LOST I SEE HIM GALLOPING ACROSS ME CORPORAL TO THE LEFT TO BRING UP THE REMAINS OF THE ENGLISH HORSE ALONG WITH HIM TO SUPPORT THE RIGHT
5192-19397-0080 AND TEAR THE LAUREL FROM LUXEMBOURG'S BROWS IF YET TIS POSSIBLE I SEE HIM WITH THE KNOT OF HIS SCARFE JUST SHOT OFF INFUSING FRESH SPIRITS INTO POOR GALWAY'S REGIMENT RIDING ALONG THE LINE
5192-19397-0081 THEN WHEELING ABOUT AND CHARGING CONTI AT THE HEAD OF IT BRAVE BRAVE BY HEAVEN CRIED MY UNCLE TOBY HE DESERVES A CROWN AS RICHLY AS A THIEF A HALTER SHOUTED TRIM MY UNCLE TOBY KNEW THE CORPORAL'S LOYALTY
5192-19397-0082 IT DID NOT ALTOGETHER STRIKE THE CORPORAL'S FANCY WHEN HE HAD MADE IT BUT IT COULD NOT BE RECALL'D SO HE HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT PROCEED AS THE NUMBER OF WOUNDED WAS PRODIGIOUS AND NO ONE HAD TIME TO THINK OF ANY THING BUT HIS OWN SAFETY THOUGH TALMASH
5192-19397-0083 SAID MY UNCLE TOBY BROUGHT OFF THE FOOT WITH GREAT PRUDENCE BUT I WAS LEFT UPON THE FIELD SAID THE CORPORAL
5192-19397-0084 SO THAT IT WAS NOON THE NEXT DAY CONTINUED THE CORPORAL BEFORE I WAS EXCHANGED AND PUT INTO A CART WITH THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN MORE IN ORDER TO BE CONVEY'D TO OUR HOSPITAL
5192-19397-0085 EXCEPT THE GROIN SAID MY UNCLE TOBY AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR REPLIED THE CORPORAL THE KNEE IN MY OPINION
5339-14133-0000 BLACK AND BITTER BUT WELCOME ENOUGH TO THE FARMERS
5339-14133-0001 AND BELL ROBSON THOUGH NOT GETTING WORSE DID NOT MAKE ANY PROGRESS TOWARDS AMENDMENT
5339-14133-0002 OR WASHING OR CHURNING DAYS HER LIFE WAS QUIET AND MONOTONOUS ALTHOUGH HARD WORKING AND WHILE HER HANDS MECHANICALLY FOUND AND DID THEIR ACCUSTOMED LABOUR THE THOUGHTS THAT ROSE IN HER HEAD ALWAYS CENTRED ON CHARLEY KINRAID HIS WAYS HIS WORDS
5339-14133-0003 LIKE NANCY AND BORROWING THE POOR GIRL'S OWN WORDS SHE WOULD SAY SOFTLY TO HERSELF HE ONCE WAS HERE BUT ALL ALONG SHE BELIEVED IN HER HEART HE WOULD COME BACK AGAIN TO HER THOUGH IT TOUCHED HER STRANGELY TO IMAGINE THE AGONIES OF FORSAKEN LOVE
5339-14133-0004 HE WAS VERY BUSY WITH FACTS AND FIGURES
5339-14133-0005 AND TO SEE SYLVIA FOR THE TWO FOSTERS WERE PUNCTILIOUSLY ANXIOUS TO MAKE THEIR SHOPMEN TEST ALL THEIR STATEMENTS INSISTING ON AN EXAMINATION OF THE STOCK AS IF HEPBURN AND COULSON WERE STRANGERS TO THE SHOP
5339-14133-0006 BY DEGREES BOTH HEPBURN AND COULSON WERE INTRODUCED TO DISTANT MANUFACTURERS AND WHOLESALE DEALERS
5339-14133-0007 BUT THIS IT WAS EVIDENT WOULD NOT HAVE SATISFIED THEIR MASTERS WHO WERE SCRUPULOUS IN INSISTING THAT WHATEVER ADVANTAGE THERE WAS SHOULD ALWAYS FALL ON THE SIDE OF THE YOUNGER MEN WHEN PHILIP SAW SYLVIA SHE WAS ALWAYS QUIET AND GENTLE
5339-14133-0008 PERHAPS MORE SILENT THAN SHE HAD BEEN A YEAR AGO AND SHE DID NOT ATTEND SO BRISKLY TO WHAT WAS PASSING AROUND HER SHE WAS RATHER THINNER AND PALER BUT WHATEVER CHANGE THERE WAS IN HER WAS ALWAYS AN IMPROVEMENT IN PHILIP'S EYES
5339-14133-0009 SO LONG AS SHE SPOKE GRACIOUSLY TO HIM HE THOUGHT SHE WAS SUFFERING FROM LONG CONTINUED ANXIETY ABOUT HER MOTHER OR THAT SHE HAD TOO MUCH TO DO AND EITHER CAUSE WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM TREAT HER WITH A GRAVE REGARD AND DEFERENCE WHICH HAD A REPRESSED TENDERNESS IN IT
5339-14133-0010 OF WHICH SHE OTHERWISE OCCUPIED WAS QUITE UNAWARE SHE LIKED HIM BETTER TOO THAN SHE HAD DONE A YEAR OR TWO BEFORE BECAUSE HE DID NOT SHOW HER ANY OF THE EAGER ATTENTION WHICH TEASED HER THEN ALTHOUGH ITS MEANING WAS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD
5339-14133-0011 THINGS WERE MUCH IN THIS STATE WHEN THE FROST BROKE AND MILDER WEATHER SUCCEEDED THIS WAS THE TIME SO LONG LOOKED FORWARD TO BY THE INVALID AND HER FRIENDS AS FAVOURING THE DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION OF CHANGE OF AIR HER HUSBAND WAS TO TAKE HER
5339-14133-0012 TO SPEND A FORTNIGHT WITH A KINDLY NEIGHBOUR WHO LIVED NEAR THE FARM THEY HAD OCCUPIED FORTY MILES OR SO INLAND BEFORE THEY CAME TO HAYTERSBANK THE WIDOW WOMAN WAS TO COME AND STAY IN THE HOUSE TO KEEP SYLVIA COMPANY DURING HER MOTHER'S ABSENCE
5339-14133-0013 DANIEL INDEED WAS TO RETURN HOME AFTER CONVEYING HIS WIFE TO HER DESTINATION BUT THERE WAS SO MUCH TO BE DONE ON THE LAND AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR THAT SYLVIA WOULD HAVE BEEN ALONE ALL DAY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE ARRANGEMENT JUST MENTIONED
5339-14133-0014 AND YET THESE MUST BE REACHED BEFORE JUNE OR THE YEAR'S EXPEDITION WOULD BE OF LITTLE AVAIL EVERY BLACKSMITH'S SHOP RUNG WITH THE RHYTHMICAL CLANG OF BUSY HAMMERS BEATING OUT OLD IRON SUCH AS HORSESHOES NAILS OR STUBS INTO THE GREAT HARPOONS
5339-14133-0015 CONSCIOUS OF THE DEMAND IN WHICH THEY WERE HELD AT THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR IT WAS WAR TIME TOO MANY CAPTAINS UNABLE TO PROCURE MEN IN MONKSHAVEN WOULD HAVE TO COMPLETE THEIR CREWS IN THE SHETLANDS THE SHOPS IN THE TOWN WERE EQUALLY BUSY
5339-14133-0016 STORES HAD TO BE PURCHASED BY THE WHALING MASTERS WARM CLOTHING OF ALL SORTS TO BE PROVIDED THESE WERE THE LARGER WHOLESALE ORDERS BUT MANY A MAN AND WOMAN TOO BROUGHT OUT THEIR SMALL HOARDS TO PURCHASE EXTRA COMFORTS OR PRECIOUS KEEPSAKES FOR SOME BELOVED ONE
5339-14133-0017 IT WAS THE TIME OF THE GREAT HALF YEARLY TRAFFIC OF THE PLACE ANOTHER IMPETUS WAS GIVEN TO BUSINESS WHEN THE WHALERS RETURNED IN THE AUTUMN AND THE MEN WERE FLUSH OF MONEY AND FULL OF DELIGHT AT ONCE MORE SEEING THEIR HOMES AND THEIR FRIENDS
5339-14133-0018 THERE WAS MUCH TO BE DONE IN FOSTERS SHOP AND LATER HOURS WERE KEPT THAN USUAL SOME PERPLEXITY OR OTHER WAS OCCUPYING JOHN AND JEREMIAH FOSTER
5339-14133-0019 BUT IT THUS HAPPENED THAT THEY DID NOT GIVE THE PROMPT ASSISTANCE THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO RENDER AT SUCH TIMES AND COULSON HAD BEEN AWAY ON SOME OF THE NEW EXPEDITIONS DEVOLVING ON HIM AND PHILIP AS FUTURE PARTNERS
5339-14133-0020 ONE EVENING AFTER THE SHOP WAS CLOSED WHILE THEY WERE EXAMINING THE GOODS AND COMPARING THE SALES WITH THE ENTRIES IN THE DAY BOOK COULSON SUDDENLY INQUIRED BY THE WAY HESTER DOES THEE KNOW WHERE THE PARCEL OF BEST BANDANAS IS GONE THERE WAS FOUR LEFT AS I'M PRETTY SURE WHEN I SET OFF TO SANDSEND
5339-14133-0021 IS HE HERE AGAIN SAID PHILIP I DIDN'T SEE HIM WHAT BRINGS HIM HERE
5339-14133-0022 I WISH I'D SEEN HIM SAID COULSON
5339-14133-0023 WHY WHAT'S UP SAID PHILIP SURPRISED AT WILLIAM'S UNUSUAL MANNER AND AT THE SAME TIME RATHER GRATIFIED TO FIND A REFLECTION OF HIS OWN FEELINGS ABOUT KINRAID COULSON'S FACE WAS PALE WITH ANGER
5339-14133-0024 AND THEN MY MASTER SAW ANOTHER GIRL THAT HE LIKED BETTER' WILLIAM ALMOST CHOKED IN HIS ENDEAVOUR TO KEEP DOWN ALL APPEARANCE OF VIOLENT ANGER AND THEN WENT ON AND THAT HE PLAYED T SAME GAME WI AS I'VE HEERD TELL AND HOW DID THY SISTER TAKE IT
5339-14133-0025 SHE DIED IN A SIX MONTH SAID WILLIAM SHE FORGIVED HIM BUT IT'S BEYOND ME I THOUGHT IT WERE HIM WHEN I HEERD OF T WORK ABOUT DARLEY KINRAID AND COMING FRA NEWCASSEL WHERE ANNIE LIVED PRENTICE AND I MADE INQUIRY
5339-14133-0026 THIS FAULT OF HIS WAS ONE WITH WHICH THE TWO GRAVE SEDATE YOUNG MEN HAD NO SYMPATHY THEIR HEARTS WERE TRUE AND CONSTANT WHATEVER ELSE MIGHT BE THEIR FAILINGS AND IT IS NO NEW THING TO DAMN THE FAULTS WE HAVE NO MIND TO
5339-14133-0027 HE HAD ONLY COME THAT AFTERNOON TO MONKSHAVEN AND FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF SEEING SYLVIA ONCE MORE BEFORE HE WENT TO FULFIL HIS ENGAGEMENT AS SPECKSIONEER IN THE URANIA A WHALING VESSEL THAT WAS TO SAIL FROM NORTH SHIELDS ON THURSDAY MORNING AND THIS WAS MONDAY
5339-14133-0028 SYLVIA SAT IN THE HOUSE PLACE HER BACK TO THE LONG LOW WINDOW IN ORDER TO HAVE ALL THE LIGHT THE AFTERNOON HOUR AFFORDED FOR HER WORK A BASKET OF HER FATHER'S UNMENDED STOCKINGS WAS ON THE LITTLE ROUND TABLE BESIDE HER
5339-14133-0029 AND ONE WAS ON HER LEFT HAND WHICH SHE SUPPOSED HERSELF TO BE MENDING BUT FROM TIME TO TIME SHE MADE LONG PAUSES AND LOOKED IN THE FIRE AND YET THERE WAS BUT LITTLE MOTION OF FLAME OR LIGHT IN IT OUT OF WHICH TO CONJURE VISIONS
5339-14133-0030 IT WAS REDD UP FOR THE AFTERNOON COVERED WITH A BLACK MASS OF COAL OVER WHICH THE EQUALLY BLACK KETTLE HUNG ON THE CROOK IN THE BACK KITCHEN DOLLY REID SYLVIA'S ASSISTANT DURING HER MOTHER'S ABSENCE CHANTED A LUGUBRIOUS DITTY BEFITTING HER CONDITION AS A WIDOW
5339-14133-0031 CHARLEY KINRAID AND THE STORY OF CRAZY NANCY HAD BEEN THE SUBJECTS FOR HER DREAMS FOR MANY A DAY AND MANY A NIGHT NOW HE STOOD THERE BRIGHT AND HANDSOME AS EVER WITH JUST THAT MUCH TIMIDITY IN HIS FACE THAT ANXIETY AS TO HIS WELCOME
5339-14133-0032 SHE DID NOT COME FORWARD TO MEET HIM SHE WENT CRIMSON TO THE VERY ROOTS OF HER HAIR BUT THAT IN THE WANING LIGHT HE COULD NOT SEE AND SHE SHOOK SO THAT SHE FELT AS IF SHE COULD HARDLY STAND BUT THE TREMOR WAS NOT VISIBLE TO HIM
5339-14133-0033 THE TONES THE LOOKS THAT HAD ACCOMPANIED THOSE WORDS BUT ALL SHE SAID WAS I DIDN'T THINK TO SEE YO
5339-14133-0034 SHE FELT HIS EYES WERE UPON HER WATCHING EVERY MOTION AND GREW MORE AND MORE CONFUSED IN HER EXPRESSION AND BEHAVIOUR HE WAS A LITTLE TAKEN ABACK BY THE NATURE OF HIS RECEPTION AND WAS NOT SURE AT FIRST WHETHER TO TAKE THE GREAT CHANGE IN HER MANNER
5339-14133-0035 AS A FAVOURABLE SYMPTOM OR OTHERWISE BY AND BY LUCKILY FOR HIM IN SOME TURN OF HER ARM TO REACH THE SCISSORS ON THE TABLE SHE CAUGHT THE EDGE OF HER WORK BASKET AND DOWN IT FELL SHE STOOPED TO PICK UP THE SCATTERED STOCKINGS AND BALL OF WORSTED
5339-14133-0036 AND SO DID HE AND WHEN THEY ROSE UP HE HAD FAST HOLD OF HER HAND AND HER FACE WAS TURNED AWAY HALF READY TO CRY
5339-14133-0037 YO MIGHT HA FORGOTTEN ME AND YET I THOUGHT WE MADE A BARGAIN AGAINST FORGETTING EACH OTHER NO ANSWER HE WENT ON YO'VE NEVER BEEN OUT O MY THOUGHTS SYLVIA ROBSON
5339-14133-0038 AND I'VE BEEN NEAR NEITHER KITH NOR KIN AS YET AND NOW I'M HERE YOU WON'T SPEAK TO ME I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
5339-14133-0039 TILL I'D TAUGHT HER TO LOVE ME MORE BUT IF SHE'S A COLD HEART AND CANNOT CARE FOR A HONEST SAILOR WHY THEN I'D BEST GO BACK AT ONCE HE MADE FOR THE DOOR HE MUST HAVE BEEN PRETTY SURE FROM SOME SIGN OR OTHER OR HE WOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT IT TO HER WOMANLY PRIDE TO GIVE WAY
5339-14133-0040 HE HAD NOT TAKEN TWO STEPS WHEN SHE TURNED QUICKLY TOWARDS HIM AND SAID SOMETHING
5339-14133-0041 AND THEN THEY SAT DOWN ON THE SETTLE TOGETHER AND WHEN SHE WAS MORE COMPOSED THEY BEGAN TO TALK HE ASKED HER ABOUT HER MOTHER NOT SORRY IN HIS HEART AT BELL ROBSON'S ABSENCE
5339-14133-0042 HE HAD INTENDED IF NECESSARY TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS WISHES AND DESIRES WITH REGARD TO SYLVIA TO HER PARENTS BUT FOR VARIOUS REASONS HE WAS NOT SORRY THAT CIRCUMSTANCES
5339-14133-0043 HAD GIVEN HIM THE CHANCE OF SEEING HER ALONE AND OBTAINING HER PROMISE TO MARRY HIM WITHOUT BEING OBLIGED TO TELL EITHER HER FATHER OR HER MOTHER AT PRESENT I HA SPENT MY MONEY PRETTY FREE HE SAID AND I'VE NE'ER A PENNY TO THE FORE
5339-14133-0044 AND YO'R PARENTS MAY LOOK FOR SOMETHING BETTER FOR YO MY PRETTY
5339-14133-0045 I SHALL GO TO SEA HAPPY NOW THINKING I'VE YO'R WORD YO'RE NOT ONE TO GO BACK FROM IT I'M SURE ELSE IT'S A LONG TIME TO LEAVE SUCH A PRETTY GIRL AS YO AND NE'ER A CHANCE OF A LETTER REACHING YO JUST TO TELL YO ONCE AGAIN HOW I LOVE YO
5339-14133-0046 THERE'LL BE NO NEED O THAT MURMURED SYLVIA SHE WAS TOO DIZZY WITH HAPPINESS TO HAVE ATTENDED MUCH TO HIS DETAILS OF HIS WORLDLY PROSPECTS BUT AT THE SOUND OF HIS TENDER WORDS OF LOVE HER EAGER HEART WAS READY TO LISTEN I DON'T KNOW
5339-14133-0047 AND THERE'S YON TALL FELLOW OF A COUSIN AS LOOKS BLACK AT ME
5339-14133-0048 HE'S A NOTION OF BEING SWEET ON YO HISSELF NOT HE SAID SYLVIA WITH SOME CONTEMPT IN HER TONE
5339-14133-0049 BUT SHE WEARY OF A SUBJECT SHE CARED NOTHING ABOUT AND EAGER TO IDENTIFY HERSELF WITH ALL HIS INTERESTS ASKED HIM ABOUT HIS PLANS ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME THAT HE SAID THESE LAST WORDS AND THEY WENT ON AS LOVERS DO
5339-14133-0050 AT ANY RATE IT WAS NOT UNWELCOME HE LIKED KINRAID AND HAD STRONG SYMPATHY NOT MERELY WITH WHAT HE KNEW OF THE YOUNG SAILOR'S CHARACTER BUT WITH THE LIFE HE LED AND THE BUSINESS HE FOLLOWED
5339-14133-0051 ROBSON LISTENED TO ALL HE SAID WITH APPROVING NODS AND WINKS TILL CHARLEY HAD TOLD HIM EVERYTHING HE HAD TO SAY AND THEN HE TURNED AND STRUCK HIS BROAD HORNY PALM INTO KINRAID'S AS IF CONCLUDING A BARGAIN
5339-14133-0052 HE WOUND UP WITH A CHUCKLE AS THE THOUGHT STRUCK HIM THAT THIS GREAT PIECE OF BUSINESS OF DISPOSING OF THEIR ONLY CHILD HAD BEEN CONCLUDED WHILE HIS WIFE WAS AWAY
5339-14133-0053 MISCHIEF ONLY KNOWS BUT SHE'S NOAN KEEN ON MATTERIMONY
5339-14133-0054 WE'N BEST KEEP THIS MATTER TO OURSELVES TILL THOU COMES INT PORT AGAIN
5339-14133-0055 AN OUD MAN LIKE ME ISN'T AS GOOD COMPANY AS A PRETTY LASS LAUGHING A LOW RICH LAUGH OVER HIS OWN WIT DANIEL WENT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS AND CALLED SYLVIE
5339-14133-0056 FOR A TIME THERE WAS NO ANSWER THEN A DOOR WAS UNBOLTED AND SYLVIA SAID I CAN'T COME DOWN AGAIN
5339-14134-0000 OF THE NUMBER OF LETTERS THAT ARRIVED IN MONKSHAVEN THE FOSTERS SHOPKEEPERS AND BANKERS HAD THE LARGEST SHARE THE MORNING SUCCEEDING THE DAY ON WHICH SYLVIA HAD ENGAGED HERSELF TO KINRAID THE FOSTERS SEEMED UNUSUALLY ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN THEIR LETTERS
5339-14134-0001 SEVERAL TIMES JEREMIAH CAME OUT OF THE PARLOUR IN WHICH HIS BROTHER JOHN WAS SITTING IN EXPECTANT SILENCE AND PASSING THROUGH THE SHOP LOOKED UP AND DOWN THE MARKET PLACE IN SEARCH OF THE OLD LAME WOMAN WHO WAS CHARITABLY EMPLOYED TO DELIVER LETTERS
5339-14134-0002 AND WHO MUST HAVE BEEN LAMER THAN EVER THIS MORNING TO JUDGE FROM THE LATENESS OF HER COMING ALTHOUGH NONE BUT THE FOSTERS KNEW THE CAUSE OF THEIR IMPATIENCE FOR THEIR LETTERS YET THERE WAS SUCH TACIT SYMPATHY BETWEEN THEM AND THOSE WHOM THEY EMPLOYED
5339-14134-0003 WITH HER BASKET OF LETTERS ONE OF THESE SEEMED OF ESPECIAL CONSEQUENCE TO THE GOOD BROTHERS THEY EACH SEPARATELY LOOKED AT THE DIRECTION AND THEN AT ONE ANOTHER AND WITHOUT A WORD THEY RETURNED WITH IT UNREAD INTO THE PARLOUR SHUTTING THE DOOR AND DRAWING THE GREEN SILK CURTAIN CLOSE THE BETTER TO READ IT IN PRIVACY
5339-14134-0004 AND WERE PERHAPS AS FULL OF CONSIDERATION AS TO THE POSSIBLE CONTENTS OF THIS LONDON LETTER
5339-14134-0005 A MINUTE AGO PHILIP AND HE WERE ON A LEVEL OF IGNORANCE FROM WHICH THE FORMER WAS EVIDENTLY GOING TO BE RAISED BUT HE SOON RETURNED TO HIS USUAL STATE OF ACQUIESCENCE IN THINGS AS THEY WERE WHICH WAS PARTLY CONSTITUTIONAL AND PARTLY THE RESULT OF HIS QUAKER TRAINING
5339-14134-0006 IT WAS APPARENTLY BY JOHN FOSTER'S WISH THAT PHILIP HAD BEEN SUMMONED JEREMIAH THE LESS ENERGETIC AND DECIDED BROTHER WAS STILL DISCUSSING THE PROPRIETY OF THE STEP WHEN PHILIP ENTERED
5339-14134-0007 THAT THE FOSTERS HAD FOR SOME TIME RECEIVED ANONYMOUS LETTERS WARNING THEM WITH DISTINCT MEANING THOUGH IN AMBIGUOUS TERMS AGAINST A CERTAIN SILK MANUFACTURER IN SPITALFIELDS WITH WHOM THEY HAD HAD STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS DEALINGS FOR MANY YEARS
5339-14134-0008 BUT TO WHOM THEY HAD LATTERLY ADVANCED MONEY THE LETTERS HINTED AT THE UTTER INSOLVENCY OF THIS MANUFACTURER THEY HAD URGED THEIR CORRESPONDENT TO GIVE THEM HIS NAME IN CONFIDENCE AND THIS MORNING'S LETTER HAD BROUGHT IT
5339-14134-0009 BUT THE NAME WAS TOTALLY UNKNOWN TO THEM THOUGH THERE SEEMED NO REASON TO DOUBT THE REALITY OF EITHER IT OR THE ADDRESS THE LATTER OF WHICH WAS GIVEN IN FULL
5339-14134-0010 AND WAS PUBLICLY DISTINGUISHED FOR HIS EXCELLENT AND PHILANTHROPIC CHARACTER BUT THESE LETTERS WERE PROVOCATIVE OF ANXIETY ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS MORNING'S POST HAD BROUGHT OUT THE WRITER'S FULL NAME AND VARIOUS PARTICULARS SHOWING HIS INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF DICKINSON'S AFFAIRS
5339-14134-0011 AFTER MUCH PERPLEXED CONSULTATION JOHN HAD HIT UPON THE PLAN OF SENDING HEPBURN TO LONDON TO MAKE SECRET INQUIRIES RESPECTING THE TRUE CHARACTER AND COMMERCIAL POSITION OF THE MAN WHOSE CREDITORS NOT A MONTH AGO THEY HAD ESTEEMED IT AN HONOUR TO BE
5339-14134-0012 EVEN NOW JEREMIAH WAS ASHAMED OF THEIR WANT OF CONFIDENCE IN ONE SO GOOD HE BELIEVED THAT THE INFORMATION THEY HAD RECEIVED WOULD ALL PROVE A MISTAKE FOUNDED ON ERRONEOUS GROUNDS IF NOT A PURE INVENTION OF AN ENEMY
5339-14134-0013 AND HE HAD ONLY BEEN BROUGHT PARTIALLY TO CONSENT TO THE SENDING OF HEPBURN BY HIS BROTHER'S PLEDGING HIMSELF THAT THE REAL NATURE OF PHILIP'S ERRAND SHOULD BE UNKNOWN TO ANY HUMAN CREATURE SAVE THEM THREE AS ALL THIS WAS BEING REVEALED TO PHILIP HE SAT APPARENTLY UNMOVED AND SIMPLY ATTENTIVE
5339-14134-0014 IN FACT HE WAS GIVING ALL HIS MIND TO UNDERSTANDING THE PROBABILITIES OF THE CASE LEAVING HIS OWN FEELINGS IN THE BACKGROUND TILL HIS INTELLECT SHOULD HAVE DONE ITS WORK HE SAID LITTLE BUT WHAT HE DID SAY WAS TO THE POINT AND SATISFIED BOTH BROTHERS
5339-14134-0015 JOHN PERCEIVED THAT HIS MESSENGER WOULD EXERCISE PENETRATION AND ACT WITH ENERGY WHILE JEREMIAH WAS SOOTHED BY PHILIP'S CAUTION IN NOT HASTILY ADMITTING THE PROBABILITY OF ANY CHARGE AGAINST DICKINSON AND IN GIVING FULL WEIGHT TO HIS PREVIOUS GOOD CONDUCT AND GOOD CHARACTER
5339-14134-0016 PHILIP HAD THE SATISFACTION OF FEELING HIMSELF EMPLOYED ON A MISSION WHICH WOULD CALL OUT HIS POWERS AND YET NOT EXCEED THEM IN HIS OWN MIND HE FORESTALLED THE INSTRUCTIONS OF HIS MASTERS AND WAS SILENTLY IN ADVANCE OF JOHN FOSTER'S PLANS AND ARRANGEMENTS
5339-14134-0017 WHILE HE APPEARED TO LISTEN TO ALL THAT WAS SAID WITH QUIET BUSINESS LIKE ATTENTION IT WAS SETTLED THAT THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS TO MAKE HIS WAY NORTHWARDS TO HARTLEPOOL WHENCE HE COULD EASILY PROCEED EITHER BY LAND OR SEA TO NEWCASTLE FROM WHICH PLACE SMACKS WERE CONSTANTLY SAILING TO LONDON
5339-14134-0018 SAYING IT WAS MORE THAN HE SHOULD REQUIRE BUT THEY REPEATED WITH FRESH URGENCY THEIR WARNINGS ABOUT THE TERRIBLE HIGH PRICES OF LONDON TILL HE COULD ONLY RESOLVE TO KEEP A STRICT ACCOUNT AND BRING BACK ALL THAT HE DID NOT EXPEND SINCE NOTHING BUT HIS TAKING THE WHOLE SUM WOULD SATISFY HIS EMPLOYERS
5339-14134-0019 THE LATTER WAS SILENT BROODING OVER THE CONFIDENCE WHICH PHILIP HAD APPARENTLY RECEIVED BUT WHICH WAS WITHHELD FROM HIM HE DID NOT YET KNOW OF THE CULMINATING POINT OF PHILIP'S PROPOSED JOURNEY TO LONDON
5339-14134-0020 THAT GREAT CITY OF LONDON WHICH FROM ITS VERY INACCESSIBILITY FIFTY YEARS AGO LOOMED SO MAGNIFICENT THROUGH THE MIST OF MEN'S IMAGINATIONS IT IS NOT TO BE DENIED THAT PHILIP FELT EXULTANT AT THE MERE FACT OF GOING TO LONDON BUT THEN AGAIN THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING SYLVIA
5339-14134-0021 OF NOT SEEING HER FOR A WEEK A FORTNIGHT NAY HE MIGHT BE AWAY FOR A MONTH FOR NO RASH HURRY WAS TO MAR HIS DELICATE NEGOTIATION GNAWED AT HIS HEART
5339-14134-0022 SEVERAL TIMES THAT DAY AS HE PERCEIVED COULSON'S JEALOUS SULLENNESS
5339-14134-0023 AS THEY ALL SAT AT TEA IN ALICE ROSE'S HOUSE PLACE PHILIP ANNOUNCED HIS INTENDED JOURNEY
5339-14134-0024 TO LUNNON EXCLAIMED ALICE HESTER SAID NOTHING
5339-14134-0025 SAID COULSON LUCK SAID ALICE TURNING SHARP ROUND ON HIM NIVER LET ME HEAR SUCH A VAIN WORD OUT O THY MOUTH LADDIE AGAIN IT'S THE LORD'S DOING AND LUCK'S THE DEVIL'S WAY O PUTTING IT
5339-14134-0026 NIVER FRET THYSELF MOTHER ABOUT T SHIRT SAID PHILIP IF I NEED A SHIRT
5339-14134-0027 BUT IF THAT'S THE FRAME O MIND THOU'RT IN LUNNON IS LIKE FOR TO BE A SORE PLACE O TEMPTATION THERE'S PITFALLS FOR MEN AND TRAPS FOR MONEY AT IVERY TURN AS I'VE HEERD SAY
5339-14134-0028 SAID COULSON HE'S SENT FOR
5339-14134-0029 PHILIP KNOWS SAID HESTER AND THEN SOMEHOW HER VOICE FAILED HER AND SHE STOPPED PHILIP PAID NO ATTENTION TO THIS HALF UTTERED SENTENCE HE WAS EAGER TO TELL COULSON AS FAR AS HE COULD DO SO WITHOUT BETRAYING HIS MASTER'S SECRET HOW MANY DRAWBACKS THERE WERE TO HIS PROPOSED JOURNEY
5339-14134-0030 IN THE RESPONSIBILITY WHICH IT INVOLVED AND HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO LEAVE MONKSHAVEN HE SAID COULSON I'D GIVE A DEAL IT WERE THOU THAT WERE GOING AND NOT ME AT LEAST THERE IS MANY A TIME I'D GIVE A DEAL
5339-14134-0031 I'LL NOT DENY BUT AT OTHER TIMES I'M PLEASED AT THE THOUGHT ON'T BUT IF I COULD I'D CHANGE PLACES WI THEE AT THIS MOMENT IT'S FINE TALKING SAID COULSON HALF MOLLIFIED AND YET NOT CARING TO SHOW IT I MAKE NO DOUBT IT WERE AN EVEN CHANCE BETWIXT US TWO AT FIRST
5339-14134-0032 SHE WAS PLAYING WITH HER TEASPOON BUT HE COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS CHOKING DOWN HER TEARS
5339-14134-0033 WHAT'S TO DO HESTER SAID HE SHE LIFTED UP THOSE EYES USUALLY SO SOFT AND SERENE NOW THEY WERE FULL OF THE LIGHT OF INDIGNATION SHINING THROUGH TEARS TO DO SHE SAID COULSON I'D THOUGHT BETTER OF THEE
5339-14134-0034 GOING AND DOUBTING AND ENVYING PHILIP AS NIVER DID THEE AN ILL TURN OR SAID AN ILL WORD OR THOUGHT AN ILL THOUGHT BY THEE AND SENDING HIM AWAY OUT O T HOUSE THIS LAST NIGHT OF ALL
5339-14134-0035 SHE HASTILY GOT UP AND LEFT THE ROOM
5339-14134-0036 AND YET HE WAS REPROACHED FOR THE COURSE IT WAS TAKING
5339-14134-0037 AND TILL HE HAD PATIENTLY WITH LONG CONTINUING AND DEEP AFFECTION WORKED HIS WAY INTO HER REGARD WAS SET ASIDE DURING THE PRESENT WALK HE WOULD SPEAK TO HER OF HIS PASSIONATE ATTACHMENT BEFORE HE LEFT FOR AN UNCERTAIN LENGTH OF TIME AND THE CERTAIN DISTANCE OF LONDON
5339-14134-0038 AND ALL THE MODIFICATION ON THIS POINT WHICH HIS JUDGMENT COULD OBTAIN FROM HIS IMPETUOUS AND EXCITED HEART WAS THAT HE WOULD WATCH HER WORDS AND MANNER WELL WHEN HE ANNOUNCED HIS APPROACHING ABSENCE AND IF IN THEM HE READ THE SLIGHTEST TOKEN OF TENDER REGRETFUL FEELING
5339-14134-0039 HE WOULD POUR OUT HIS LOVE AT HER FEET NOT EVEN URGING THE YOUNG GIRL TO MAKE ANY RETURN OR TO EXPRESS THE FEELINGS OF WHICH HE HOPED THE GERM WAS ALREADY BUDDING IN HER HE WOULD BE PATIENT WITH HER HE COULD NOT BE PATIENT HIMSELF
5339-14134-0040 THEY HAD SEEN HIM ALREADY OR HIS IMPULSE WOULD HAVE BEEN TO DODGE BEHIND THE WALL AND AVOID THEM EVEN THOUGH ONE OF HIS PURPOSES IN GOING TO HAYTERSBANK HAD BEEN TO BID HIS UNCLE FAREWELL KINRAID TOOK HIM BY SURPRISE FROM THE HEARTY GREETING HE GAVE HIM
5339-14134-0041 AND CONVINCED OF HER GREAT LOVE TOWARDS HIMSELF HAD FORGOTTEN ANY PREVIOUS JEALOUSY OF PHILIP SECURE AND EXULTANT HIS BROAD HANDSOME WEATHER BRONZED FACE WAS AS GREAT A CONTRAST TO PHILIP'S LONG THOUGHTFUL SALLOW COUNTENANCE
5339-14134-0042 HE TOLD HIS UNCLE THAT HE WAS BOUND FOR LONDON THE NEXT DAY ON BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH THE FOSTERS DANIEL WAS DEEPLY STRUCK WITH THE FACT THAT HE WAS TALKING TO A MAN SETTING OFF FOR LONDON AT A DAY'S NOTICE

5339-14134-0046 THOUGH OUR SHIP LAY A FORTNEET OFF GRAVESEND KINRAID NOW SEEMED IN A HURRY BUT PHILIP WAS STUNG WITH CURIOSITY TO ASCERTAIN HIS MOVEMENTS AND SUDDENLY ADDRESSED HIM I HEARD YO WERE THESE PARTS
5339-14134-0047 AND SAIL FOR THE NORTH SEAS DAY AFTER HE TURNED AWAY AND BEGAN TO WHISTLE AS IF HE DID NOT WISH FOR ANY FURTHER CONVERSATION WITH HIS INTERROGATOR PHILIP INDEED HAD NOTHING MORE TO SAY TO HIM HE HAD LEARNED ALL HE WANTED TO KNOW I'D LIKE TO BID GOOD BY TO SYLVIE IS SHE AT HOME HE ASKED OF HER FATHER
5339-14134-0048 SO THEY PARTED BUT PHILIP HAD NOT GONE MANY STEPS BEFORE HIS UNCLE CALLED HIM BACK KINRAID SLOWLY LOITERING ON MEANWHILE
5339-14134-0049 GEARIN AND A AN FOLK IS TALKIN ON A NEW KIND O MAK AND IF THOU'S BOUND FOR YORK I'M NOT GOING BY YORK I'M GOING BY A NEWCASTLE SMACK NEWCASSEL

5339-14134-0052 BRUNTON SELLS CHEESE AND THAT'S NO BETTER PHILIP PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST AND TO WRITE WORD TO ROBSON WHO SATISFIED WITH HIS WILLINGNESS TO UNDERTAKE THE COMMISSION BADE HIM GO ON AND SEE IF HE COULD NOT FIND THE LASS
5339-14134-0053 AND SHE HAD COVERTLY WATCHED THEM UP THE BROW IN THE FIELD SHE SATE DOWN TO MEDITATE AND DREAM ABOUT HER GREAT HAPPINESS IN BEING BELOVED BY HER HERO CHARLEY KINRAID NO GLOOMY DREAD OF HIS LONG SUMMER'S ABSENCE NO FEAR OF THE COLD
5339-14134-0054 GLITTERING ICEBERGS BEARING MERCILESSLY DOWN ON THE URANIA NOR SHUDDERING ANTICIPATION OF THE DARK WAVES OF EVIL IMPORT CROSSED HER MIND HE LOVED HER AND THAT WAS ENOUGH HER EYES LOOKED TRANCE LIKE INTO A DIM GLORIOUS FUTURE OF LIFE
5339-14134-0055 HER LIPS STILL WARM AND REDDENED BY HIS KISS WERE JUST PARTED IN A HAPPY SMILE WHEN SHE WAS STARTLED BY THE SOUND OF AN APPROACHING FOOTSTEP A FOOTSTEP QUITE FAMILIAR ENOUGH FOR HER TO RECOGNIZE IT AND WHICH WAS UNWELCOME NOW
5339-14134-0056 AS DISTURBING HER IN THE ONE BLESSED SUBJECT OF THOUGHT IN WHICH ALONE SHE CARED TO INDULGE WELL PHILIP AN WHAT BRINGS HERE WAS HER RATHER UNGRACIOUS GREETING WHY SYLVIE ARE YO SORRY TO SEE ME
5339-14134-0057 BUT SHE TURNED IT OFF WITH ASSUMED LIGHTNESS OH YES
5339-14134-0058 PENITENTLY AS IF ANXIOUS TO BE FORGIVEN SYLVIA DID NOT WANT HIS PENITENCE DID NOT CARE FOR HER RIBBON WAS TROUBLED BY HIS EARNESTNESS OF MANNER BUT HE KNEW NOTHING OF ALL THAT HE ONLY KNEW
5339-14134-0059 THAT SHE WHOM HE LOVED HAD ASKED HIM TO DO SOMETHING FOR HER AND HE HAD NEGLECTED IT SO ANXIOUS TO BE EXCUSED AND FORGIVEN HE WENT ON WITH THE APOLOGY SHE CARED NOT TO HEAR IF SHE HAD BEEN LESS OCCUPIED WITH HER OWN AFFAIRS LESS ENGROSSED WITH DEEP FEELING
5339-14134-0060 SHE WOULD HAVE REPROACHED HIM IF ONLY IN JEST FOR HIS CARELESSNESS AS IT WAS SHE SCARCELY TOOK IN THE SENSE OF HIS WORDS
5339-14134-0061 HE PAUSED A LITTLE SYLVIA'S GALLOPING THOUGHTS WERE PULLED SUDDENLY UP BY HIS SILENCE SHE FELT THAT HE WANTED HER TO SAY SOMETHING BUT SHE COULD THINK OF NOTHING BESIDES AN AMBIGUOUS WELL
5339-14134-0062 ALMOST AS IF BESEECHING HER TO SHOW OR EXPRESS SOME SORROW AT A JOURNEY THE VERY DESTINATION OF WHICH SHOWED THAT HE WOULD BE ABSENT FOR SOME TIME TO LUNNON
5339-14134-0063 NOTHING MORE AS PHILIP'S INSTINCT TOLD HIM BUT HE REASONED THAT FIRST CORRECT IMPRESSION AWAY WITH INGENIOUS SOPHISTRY NOT TO LIVE THERE ONLY TO STAY FOR SOME TIME
5339-14134-0064 SUDDENLY A LIGHT SHONE DOWN INTO PHILIP'S MIND HIS VOICE WAS CHANGED AS HE SPOKE NEXT
5339-14134-0065 SHE STOOPED FOR SOMETHING SHE HAD DROPPED AND CAME UP RED AS A ROSE TO BE SURE WHAT THEN AND SHE EYED HIM DEFIANTLY THOUGH IN HER HEART SHE TREMBLED SHE KNEW NOT WHY WHAT THEN
5339-14134-0066 THAT THE HALF OF SOME SILVER COIN WAS AMONG THE CONTENTS THUS TURNED OVER BEFORE THE BOX WAS LOCKED BUT THY MOTHER WOULDN'T LIKE IT SYLVIE HE'S PLAYED FALSE WI OTHER LASSES HE'LL BE PLAYING THEE FALSE SOME O THESE DAYS IF THOU LETS HIM COME ABOUT THEE
5339-14134-0067 IT WERE WILLIE COULSON AS TELLED ME AS SOLEMN AND SERIOUS AS ONE MAN CAN SPEAK TO ANOTHER
5339-14134-0068 SAID SYLVIA SHIVERING ALL OVER WITH PASSION
5339-14134-0069 IT WERE YO'R OWN MOTHER SYLVIA AS KNOWED YO HAD NO BROTHER OR ANY ONE TO SEE AFTER YO AND YO SO PRETTY SO PRETTY SYLVIA HE CONTINUED SHAKING HIS HEAD SADLY THAT MEN RUN AFTER YO AGAINST THEIR WILL AS ONE MAY SAY
5339-14134-0070 AND TO WARN YO IF NEED WERE MY MOTHER NIVER BADE YO TO COME SPYING AFTER ME AND BLAMING ME FOR SEEING A LAD AS MY FEYTHER THINKS WELL ON
5339-14134-0071 SYLVIE SYLVIE
5339-14134-0072 DARK THE WOOD FIRE NOT GATHERED TOGETHER BY CAREFUL HANDS DIED OUT INTO GRAY ASHES DOLLY REID HAD DONE HER WORK AND GONE HOME THERE WERE BUT PHILIP AND SYLVIA IN THE HOUSE
5339-14134-0073 AT LENGTH HE RAISED HIS STIFFENED BODY AND STOOD UP DIZZY UP THE LITTLE WOODEN STAIRS HE WENT WHERE HE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE TO THE SMALL SQUARE LANDING ALMOST FILLED UP WITH THE GREAT CHEST FOR OAT CAKE HE BREATHED HARD FOR A MINUTE AND THEN KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF SYLVIA'S ROOM
5339-14134-0074 SYLVIE I'M GOING AWAY SAY GOOD BY NO ANSWER NOT A SOUND HEARD SYLVIE A LITTLE LOUDER AND LESS HOARSELY SPOKEN THERE WAS NO REPLY SYLVIE
5339-14134-0075 I SHALL BE A LONG TIME AWAY PERHAPS I MAY NIVER COME BACK AT ALL HERE HE BITTERLY THOUGHT OF AN UNREGARDED DEATH SAY GOOD BY NO ANSWER HE WAITED PATIENTLY CAN SHE BE WEARIED OUT AND GONE TO SLEEP HE WONDERED YET ONCE AGAIN
5339-14134-0076 AND GOD BLESS YO I'M SORRY I VEXED YO NO REPLY WITH A HEAVY HEAVY HEART HE CREAKED DOWN THE STAIRS FELT FOR HIS CAP AND LEFT THE HOUSE
5339-14134-0077 THE NEED FOR HIS DEPARTURE AND YET HE STOOD STILL FOR A LITTLE TIME LIKE ONE ENTRANCED AS IF HIS WILL HAD LOST ALL POWER TO COMPEL HIM TO LEAVE THE PLACE THOSE TWO WORDS OF HERS WHICH TWO HOURS BEFORE WOULD HAVE BEEN SO FAR BENEATH HIS ASPIRATIONS
5339-14134-0078 AND TOUCHED HER PRIDE MAYBE TOO
5339-14134-0079 AND I'LL BE HOME AGAIN AS SOON AS IVER I CAN IN HALF A YEAR SUCH AS HE FORGETS IF IVER HE'S THOUGHT SERIOUS ABOUT HER BUT IN A MY LIFETIME IF I LIVE TO FOURSCORE I CAN NIVER FORGET
5390-24512-0000 FOR ALTHOUGH THE JEWISH FAMILY OF THE HERODS REIGNED OVER JUDEA THEY ONLY HELD THEIR THRONE UNDER THE ROMAN EMPEROR THIS THE JEWS COULD NOT ENDURE THEY LONGED TO BE A FREE AND INDEPENDENT NATION ONCE AGAIN
5390-24512-0001 WHEN OUR MESSIAH COMES HE WILL BE A GREAT WARRIOR THEY SAID HE WILL UTTERLY DESTROY ALL OUR ENEMIES HE WILL MAKE JERUSALEM THE GREATEST AND RICHEST CITY
5390-24512-0002 HAD JESUS OF NAZARETH BEEN WILLING TO BECOME THEIR EARTHLY KING AND TO LEAD THE NATION AGAINST THE ROMANS THE JEWS WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FOLLOWED HIM TO A MAN
5390-24512-0003 THE SAVIOUR SOUGHT TO HEAL IT HE CALLED OUT THE FAITH AND GRATITUDE OF THE ROMAN CENTURION AND HIS ANSWER TO THE JEWISH LEADERS RENDER TO CAESAR THE THINGS THAT ARE CAESAR'S
5390-24512-0004 SHOWED THEM THE RIGHT ATTITUDE IN WHICH TO REGARD THE ROMAN RULE
5390-24512-0005 THE ROMAN GOVERNMENT HAD NO QUARREL WITH HIM THINE OWN NATION HATH DELIVERED THEE UNTO ME
5390-24512-0006 HAD NOT THE JEWS PREVENTED IT IF THOU LET THIS MAN GO THOU ART NOT CAESAR'S FRIEND THEY CRIED
5390-24512-0007 TO CRUCIFY JESUS OF NAZARETH AND TO FREE BARABBAS BUT IN CHOOSING THE REBEL BARABBAS
5390-24512-0008 AS THEIR HERO THE NATION STARTED ON THEIR DOWNWARD ROAD AS THE STORY OF THE FORTY YEARS WHICH FOLLOWED THE SAVIOUR'S CRUCIFIXION CLEARLY SHOWS FOR THE JEWS WERE DETERMINED AT ALL COSTS TO THROW OFF THE ROMAN YOKE
5390-24512-0009 AND THE HISTORY OF THOSE YEARS IS ONE LONG LIST OF TERRIBLE RISINGS AND MASSACRES WHILE CITIES WERE RUINED VILLAGES WRAPPED IN FLAMES AND MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN PERISHED WITH HUNGER
5390-24512-0010 YET THE KEENER THE SUFFERING THE MORE DESPERATE THE JEWS BECAME THEIR WHOLE SOULS WERE POSSESSED WITH A WILD AND MAD PASSION FOR REVENGE
5390-24512-0011 THEN IF ANY MAN SHALL SAY UNTO YOU LO HERE IS CHRIST OR THERE BELIEVE IT NOT MATTHEW
5390-24512-0012 YET NO SOONER DID A DARING REBEL OR MURDERER GATHER A BAND OF ROBBERS AROUND HIM AND BEGIN TO KILL AND PLUNDER THAN MULTITUDES OF JEWS CRIED THE CHRIST OR MESSIAH HAS COME
5390-24512-0013 WHERE THE ROMAN SOLDIERS WERE QUARTERED AND CRIED OUT TO THE GARRISON WITHIN THAT THEIR LIVES SHOULD BE SPARED IF THEY WOULD LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS THE ROMAN SOLDIERS HESITATED BUT THE JEWS PROMISED MOST FAITHFULLY TO KEEP THEIR WORD
5390-24512-0014 THE ROMANS BELIEVED THEM AND OPENED THEIR GATES BUT NO SOONER WERE THEY IN THE POWER OF THE JEWISH MOB THAN THEY WERE FALLEN UPON AND MURDERED TO THE LAST MAN AS THEY DIED THE ROMAN SOLDIERS WHOM NOT EVEN DEATH COULD TERRIFY
5390-24512-0015 LIFTED UP THEIR HANDS TO HEAVEN AS THOUGH CALLING UPON GOD TO WITNESS THAT THE JEWS HAD BROKEN THEIR SOLEMN OATH THE ROMAN EMPEROR COULD NOT OVERLOOK SUCH REBELLION AND TREACHERY
5390-24512-0016 AND HE SENT A GREAT ARMY AGAINST JERUSALEM THE JEWS SHUT THE GATES OF THEIR CITY AND SO BEGAN THE AWFUL SIEGE OF JERUSALEM AND WHEN YE SHALL SEE JERUSALEM COMPASSED WITH ARMIES
5390-24512-0017 HE WAS A PRISONER IN THE ROMAN CAMP DURING THE SIEGE OF JERUSALEM AND HE WATCHED WITH DISMAY THE GREAT BATTERING RAMS AND WAR ENGINES CRASHING THROUGH THE WALLS OF THE HOLY CITY HIS EARS RANG WITH THE CRIES OF RAGE AND DESPAIR WHICH BROKE FROM THE JEWS WITHIN
5390-24512-0018 AS ONE BY ONE THEIR DEFENCES FELL AND THE END DREW NEAR THEN FOOD FAILED IN THE CITY MEN FOUGHT LIKE DEMONS IN THE STREETS FOR A TINY LOAF OF BARLEY BREAD SO FRANTIC WERE THE PEOPLE WITH HUNGER
5390-24512-0019 THAT MOTHERS EVEN SNATCHED THE BREAD FROM THEIR OWN CHILDREN'S MOUTHS LOOK OVER THE WALLS O PEOPLE OF JERUSALEM THE ROMAN SOLDIERS ARE CRUCIFYING ALL THE PRISONERS THEY HAVE TAKEN AND THE LINE OF CROSSES IS AS LONG AS OUR CITY IS WIDE
5390-24512-0020 HARD MERCILESS AS WAS THE ROMAN GENERAL EVEN HE GREW SICK WITH HORROR AT LAST AND HE SENT HIS JEWISH PRISONER JOSEPHUS TO THE JEWS PROMISING THEM THEIR LIVES IF THEY WOULD GIVE UP THE CITY
5390-24512-0021 BUT A FURIOUS MADNESS HAD POSSESSED THE PEOPLE AND THEY REFUSED TO YIELD JOSEPHUS PLEADED IN VAIN HE WAS NOT A CHRISTIAN BUT HE COULD SEE PLAINLY ENOUGH THAT GOD WAS NO LONGER WITH HIS PEOPLE
5390-24512-0022 AH MY COUNTRYMEN HE CRIED WE DID NOTHING WITHOUT GOD IN THE PAST BUT NOW YOU ARE FIGHTING AGAINST HIM HAD GOD JUDGED YOU WORTHY OF FREEDOM HE WOULD HAVE PUNISHED THE ROMANS AS HE DID THE ASSYRIANS LONG AGO
5390-24512-0023 EVEN A JEW WHO HAD NO FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST COULD SEE PLAINLY THAT THE ANCIENT POWER AND GLORY OF HIS NATION HAD GONE AT LAST THE END CAME THE FIRST WALL FELL
5390-24512-0024 WHICH STILL GLITTERED LIKE A HILL OF SNOW IN THE MORNING SUNSHINE OR SPARKLED AS THOUGH WRAPPED IN FLAME WHEN THE SUNBEAMS STRUCK FULL ON ITS GOLDEN ROOF THEN REDDER FLAMES THAN EVER THE SUNSHINE MADE LEAPT ABOVE THE GOLDEN ROOF
5390-24512-0025 PILLARS FELL BEAMS CRUMBLED TO ASHES WHILE ROUND THE ALTAR OF SACRIFICE THE PEOPLE OF JERUSALEM LAY HEAPED TOGETHER SLAIN IN SUCH NUMBERS IN THE HOLY PLACE THAT THEIR BLOOD FLOWED DOWN THE BROAD MARBLE STEPS IN A HEAVY CRIMSON STREAM
5390-24512-0026 AND THE GOLDEN CANDLESTICK AND THE BOOK OF THE LAW WERE CARRIED AWAY IN TRIUMPH INTO HEATHEN ROME ALAS FOR THE HOLY CITY OVER WHICH THE SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD HAD STOOD AND WEPT FORTY YEARS BEFORE
5390-24512-0027 KNOWING THE SUFFERING THAT LAY BEFORE HER THESE JEWS ARE DANGEROUS WE MUST NOT ALLOW THEM TO REBUILD THEIR CITY OR TO BECOME A SEPARATE PEOPLE AGAIN AS A NATION THEY MUST CEASE TO EXIST
5390-24512-0028 SO THE ROMAN CONQUERORS OF JERUSALEM AGREED AND FROM THAT DAY ONWARD THE JEWISH PEOPLE HAVE HAD NO COUNTRY OF THEIR OWN THEY HAVE INDEED BEEN LED AWAY CAPTIVE INTO ALL NATIONS
5390-24512-0029 EXACTLY AS THE LORD FORETOLD THERE IS SCARCELY A COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE JEWS MAY NOT BE FOUND BUT JERUSALEM LIES STILL IN THE HANDS OF STRANGERS AND IS THE PROPERTY OF THE TURKISH NATION
5390-24512-0030 THE JEWS WERE NOW NO LONGER A NATION THEY HAD BECOME MERELY A BODY OF PEOPLE LED BY THEIR RABBIS OR TEACHERS OF THE LAW BUT THEY WERE STILL THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK
5390-24512-0031 THEY ALLOWED THE JEWISH TEACHERS TO CONTINUE THE SYNAGOGUE SERVICES IN OTHER PARTS OF PALESTINE AND TO TEACH IN THEIR COLLEGES THE MOST FAMOUS JEWISH COLLEGE OF THESE DAYS WAS AT TIBERIUS ON THE SHORES OF THE SEA OF GALILEE
5390-24512-0032 OVER WHOSE CLEAR DEPTHS THE LORD JESUS CHRIST HAD SAILED SO OFTEN AND BESIDE WHOSE SHORES HE HAD DONE SO MANY WONDERFUL DEEDS OF LOVE AND MERCY A GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL COLLEGE IT WAS WITH BROAD TERRACED GARDENS
5390-24512-0033 SO ALL DAY LONG THEY STUDIED AND COPIED THE OLD HEBREW BIBLE AS WE HAVE SEEN THE JEWISH SCRIBES HAD NOT BEEN CONTENT WITH TAKING THE WORD OF GOD JUST AS IT STOOD THEY HAD BEGUN EVEN IN OUR LORD'S DAY
5390-24512-0034 THAT THEY DECLARED A MAN TO BE A BLOCKHEAD IF HE KNEW ONLY THE SCRIPTURES AND NOT THE TALMUD EXPLANATION THE LAW OF MOSES IS LIKE SALT BUT THE TALMUD IS BALMY SPICE THEY WOULD SAY
5390-24512-0035 YET ALTHOUGH THEY HEEDED SO LITTLE THE TRUE MEANING OF GOD'S BOOK THEY GUARDED ITS WORDS MORE AND MORE CAREFULLY AND THE RULES FOR COPYING ANY PORTION OF THE HOLY BOOKS WERE STRICT INDEED MY SON AN OLD TEACHER WOULD SAY TO HIS PUPIL
5390-24512-0036 BEFORE YOU COPY A SINGLE WORD YOU MUST WASH YOUR BODY ALL OVER AND CLOTHE YOURSELF IN FULL JEWISH DRESS PREPARING YOUR MIND WITH SOLEMN THOUGHTS THE PARCHMENT YOU WRITE UPON MUST BE MADE FROM THE SKINS OF CLEAN ANIMALS ONLY
5390-24512-0037 THAT IS CLEAN ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF MOSES THE INK YOU WRITE WITH MUST BE OF A PURE BLACK MADE ONLY FROM A MIXTURE OF SOOT CHARCOAL AND HONEY
5390-24512-0038 THOUGH YOU KNOW THE WHOLE BOOK OF THE LAW BY HEART YOU MUST NOT WRITE A SINGLE WORD FROM MEMORY BUT RAISE YOUR EYES TO YOUR COPY AND PRONOUNCE THE WORD ALOUD BEFORE TRUSTING IT TO YOUR PEN
5390-24512-0039 BEFORE WRITING ANY OF THE NAMES OF GOD YOU MUST WASH YOUR PEN BEFORE WRITING HIS MOST SACRED NAME YOU MUST WASH YOUR WHOLE BODY IF AFTER YOUR COPY HAS ITSELF BEEN EXAMINED THREE CORRECTIONS HAVE TO BE MADE
5390-24512-0040 THAT COPY MUST BE DESTROYED NOT SATISFIED WITH ALL THESE DIRECTIONS THE MASTER TAUGHT HIS SCHOLAR TO COUNT THE LETTERS OF EVERY BOOK
5390-24512-0041 IS THE MIDDLE LETTER OF ALL THE FIVE BOOKS OF MOSES
5390-24512-0042 IS THE MIDDLE OF ALL THE WORDS
5390-24512-0043 IS THE VERY CENTRE OF ALL THE VERSES THE LETTER A THAT IS THE HEBREW LETTER WHICH STANDS FOR A OCCURS FORTY TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN TIMES THE LETTER B THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN
5390-24512-0044 AND SO ON NOT ONLY THIS BUT EVERY SCRIBE WAS REQUIRED TO KNOW FROM MEMORY EXACTLY HOW MANY LETTERS OF EACH KIND THERE SHOULD BE IN HIS SHEET BEFORE HE BEGAN TO WRITE EVERY SHEET OF PARCHMENT MUST CONTAIN AN EQUAL NUMBER OF LINES
5390-24512-0045 AND THE BREADTH OF EACH COLUMN HAD TO BE THIRTY LETTERS WIDE THERE ARE ELEVEN VERSES IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW BEGINNING AND ENDING WITH N THERE ARE FORTY VERSES IN WHICH LO IS READ THREE TIMES AND SO ON AND SO ON
5390-24512-0046 HOW TEDIOUS AND MEANINGLESS SUCH INFORMATION APPEARS OF WHAT VALUE WERE ALL THESE DETAILS TO SPEND ALL HIS DAYS IN LEARNING SUCH THINGS AS THESE COULD HAVE NO INFLUENCE ON A MAN'S CHARACTER NOR MAKE HIM A POWER FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD
5390-24512-0047 NOT FOR THIS PURPOSE HAD GOD REVEALED HIS WILL TO MAN SOME YEARS AGO IN THE COFFIN OF AN EGYPTIAN MUMMY A LITTLE JAR OF WHEAT WAS FOUND FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS IT HAD LAIN THERE SHUT UP IN THE DARK
5390-24512-0048 WHILE OUT IN THE FIELDS THE CORN WHICH HAD BEEN SOWN HAD GROWN UP AND BEEN REAPED EVERY YEAR AND MEN AND WOMEN HAD BEEN FED BUT THIS JAR OF CORN WAS USELESS BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN PREVENTED FROM DOING THE WORK IN THE WORLD FOR WHICH IT WAS CREATED
5390-24512-0049 JUST SO WAS IT WITH THE HEBREW COPIES OF GOD'S WORD LOCKED UP IN A DEAD LANGUAGE KEPT CLOSE AWAY FROM THE WORLD THEY WERE LIKE THE JAR OF WHEAT WHICH COULD NOT GROW
5390-30096-0000 CHAPTER ONE UNCLE JOHN'S FARM HOW DID I HAPPEN TO OWN A FARM ASKED UNCLE JOHN INTERRUPTING HIS SOUP LONG ENOUGH TO FIX AN INQUIRING GLANCE UPON MAJOR DOYLE WHO SAT OPPOSITE
5390-30096-0001 REPLIED THE MAJOR COMPOSEDLY IT'S A PART OF MY DUTY IN ATTENDING TO THOSE AFFAIRS YOU WON'T LOOK AFTHER YOURSELF TO LEND CERTAIN SUMS OF YOUR MONEY TO NEEDY AND AMBITIOUS YOUNG MEN WHO WANT A START IN LIFE OH UNCLE
5390-30096-0002 DO YOU DO THAT EXCLAIMED MISS PATRICIA DOYLE WHO SAT BETWEEN HER UNCLE AND FATHER AND KEPT AN ACTIVE EYE UPON BOTH SO THE MAJOR SAYS ANSWERED UNCLE JOHN DRYLY AND IT'S TRUE
5390-30096-0003 ASSERTED THE OTHER HE'S ASSISTED THREE OR FOUR SCORE YOUNG MEN TO START IN BUSINESS IN THE LAST YEAR TO MY CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE BY LENDING THEM SUMS RANGING FROM ONE TO THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS
5390-30096-0004 AND IT'S THE MOST WASTEFUL AND EXTRAVAGANT CHARITY I EVER HEARD OF BUT I'M SO GLAD CRIED PATSY CLAPPING HER HANDS WITH A DELIGHTED GESTURE IT'S A SPLENDID WAY TO DO GOOD
5390-30096-0005 WITHOUT CAPITAL YOU KNOW MANY A YOUNG FELLOW WOULD NEVER GET HIS FOOT ON THE FIRST ROUND OF THE LADDER AND MANY WILL NEVER GET IT THERE IN ANY EVENT DECLARED THE MAJOR WITH A SHAKE OF HIS GRIZZLED HEAD
5390-30096-0006 AND HOW CAN I TELL WHETHER THEY'RE DESARVING OR NOT RETORTED MAJOR DOYLE FIERCELY DO YE WANT ME TO BECOME A SLEUTH OR ENGAGE DETECTIVES TO TRACK THE OBJECTS OF YOUR ERRONEOUS PHILANTHROPY
5390-30096-0007 I JUST HAVE TO FORM A JUDGMENT AN TAKE ME CHANCES AND WHIN A POOR DEVIL GOES WRONG
5390-30096-0008 BUT SOME OF THEM MUST SUCCEED VENTURED PATSY IN A CONCILIATORY TONE SOME DO SAID JOHN MERRICK AND THAT REPAYS ME FOR ALL MY TROUBLE
5390-30096-0009 QUERIED THE MAJOR YOU MANE ALL MY THROUBLE WELL AND YOUR MONEY
5390-30096-0010 WITH ONE THING AND ANOTHER WHAT OF IT RETORTED THE LITTLE ROUND FACED MILLIONAIRE LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND STARING FIXEDLY AT THE OTHER THAT'S WHAT I EMPLOY YOU FOR NOW NOW GENTLEMEN CRIED PATSY EARNESTLY
5390-30096-0011 OF HIS FALLING DOWN AND WORSHIPING HIM JOHN MERRICK WAS A MULTI MILLIONAIRE TO BE SURE BUT THERE WERE PALLIATING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ALMOST EXCUSED HIM HE HAD BEEN SO BUSILY OCCUPIED IN INDUSTRY
5390-30096-0012 THAT HE NEVER NOTICED HOW HIS WEALTH WAS PILING UP UNTIL HE DISCOVERED IT BY ACCIDENT THEN HE PROMPTLY RETIRED TO GIVE THE OTHER FELLOWS A CHANCE AND HE NOW DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO SIMPLE ACTS OF CHARITY
5390-30096-0013 AND THE WELFARE AND ENTERTAINMENT OF HIS THREE NIECES HE HAD RESCUED MAJOR DOYLE AND HIS DAUGHTER FROM A LOWLY CONDITION AND PLACED THE FORMER IN THE GREAT BANKING HOUSE OF ISHAM MARVIN AND COMPANY
5390-30096-0014 SIMPLE IN HIS TASTES MODEST AND RETIRING LACKING THE EDUCATION AND REFINEMENTS OF POLITE SOCIETY BUT SHREWD AND EXPERIENCED IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE WORLD THE LITTLE MAN FOUND HIS GREATEST ENJOYMENT IN THE FAMILY CIRCLE
5390-30096-0015 THAT HE HAD BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN FOUNDING BEING NO LONGER ABSORBED IN BUSINESS HE HAD COME TO DETEST ITS EVERY DETAIL AND SO ALLOWED HIS BANKERS TO CARE FOR HIS FORTUNE AND HIS BROTHER IN LAW TO DISBURSE HIS INCOME
5390-30096-0016 WHILE HE HIMSELF STROVE TO ENJOY LIFE IN A SHY AND BOYISH FASHION THAT WAS AS UNUSUAL IN A MAN OF HIS WEALTH AS IT WAS ADMIRABLE HE HAD NEVER MARRIED
5390-30096-0017 PATRICIA WAS THE APPLE OF UNCLE JOHN'S EYE AND THE ONE GODDESS ENSHRINED IN HER DOTING FATHER'S HEART GLANCING AT HER
5390-30096-0018 IN HER PLAIN MUSLIN GOWN A STRANGER WOULD BE TEMPTED TO WONDER WHY SHE WAS RED HAIRED FRECKLED AS A ROBIN'S EGG PUG NOSED AND WIDE MOUTHED BUT HER BLUE EYES WERE BEAUTIFUL
5390-30096-0019 AND THEY SPARKLED WITH A COMBINATION OF SAUCY MISCHIEF AND KINDLY CONSIDERATION FOR OTHERS THAT LENT HER FACE AN INDESCRIBABLE CHARM EVERYONE LOVED PATSY DOYLE
5390-30096-0020 AND PEOPLE WOULD GAZE LONGER AT HER SMILING LIPS AND DANCING EYES THAN UPON MANY A MORE HANDSOME BUT LESS ATTRACTIVE FACE SHE WAS NEARLY SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD NOT VERY TALL AND HER FORM TO SPEAK CHARITABLY
5390-30096-0021 HE WANTED CAPITAL TO PATENT THE PUMP AND PUT IT ON THE MARKET THE THING LOOKED PRETTY GOOD JOHN SO I LENT HIM A THOUSAND OF YOUR MONEY QUITE RIGHT RETURNED UNCLE JOHN NODDING BUT PRETTY SOON HE CAME BACK WITH A SAD TALE
5390-30096-0022 HE WAS IN A BAD FIX ANOTHER FELLOW WAS CONTESTING HIS PATENT AND FIGHTING HARD TO HEAD HIM OFF IT WOULD TAKE A LOT OF MONEY TO FIGHT BACK THREE THOUSAND AT LEAST
5390-30096-0023 BUT HE WAS DECENT ABOUT IT AFTER ALL HIS FATHER HAD LEFT HIM A LITTLE FARM AT MILLVILLE HE COULDN'T SAY WHAT IT WAS WORTH BUT THERE WERE SIXTY ACRES AND SOME GOOD BUILDINGS AND HE WOULD DEED IT TO YOU AS SECURITY
5390-30096-0024 IF YOU WOULD LET HIM HAVE THREE THOUSAND MORE SO YOU TOOK THE FARM AND GAVE HIM THE MONEY I DID SIR PERHAPS I AM TO BLAME
5390-30096-0025 MAKING FIVE THOUSAND IN ALL WELL IT'S GONE JOHN AND YOU'VE GOT THE FARM THE OTHER FELLOWS WERE TOO CLEVER FOR MY YOUNG FRIEND JOSEPH WEGG AND KNOCKED OUT HIS PATENT I'M SO SORRY SAID PATSY SYMPATHETICALLY
5390-30096-0026 HE REPLIED WHAT BECAME OF THE YOUNG MAN ASKED THE GIRL HE'S A COMPETENT CHAUFFEUR AND SO HE WENT TO WORK DRIVING AN AUTOMOBILE WHERE IS MILLVILLE INQUIRED UNCLE JOHN THOUGHTFULLY SOMEWHERE AT THE NORTH OF THE STATE I BELIEVE
5390-30096-0027 HAVE YOU INVESTIGATED THE FARM AT ALL I LOOKED UP A REAL ESTATE DEALER LIVING AT MILLVILLE AND WROTE HIM ABOUT THE WEGG FARM HE SAID IF ANY ONE WANTED THE PLACE VERY BADLY IT MIGHT SELL FOR THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS HUMPH
5390-30096-0028 BUT HIS BEST INFORMATION WAS TO THE EFFECT THAT NO ONE WANTED IT AT ALL PATSY LAUGHED POOR UNCLE JOHN SHE SAID THE LITTLE MAN HOWEVER WAS SERIOUS
5390-30096-0029 FOR A TIME HE ATE WITH GREAT DELIBERATION AND REVOLVED AN INTERESTING THOUGHT IN HIS MIND YEARS AGO
5390-30096-0030 BETH IS STILL WITH LOUISE YOU KNOW AND THEY MUST FIND THE CITY DEADLY DULL JUST NOW THE FARM'S THE THING AND THE MAJOR CAN RUN UP TO SEE US FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS IN THE HOT WEATHER AND WE'LL ALL HAVE A GLORIOUS LAZY TIME

5390-30096-0032 YOU TALK AS IF IT WERE A REAL FARM INSTEAD OF A PLACE NO ONE WOULD HAVE AS A GIFT UNCLE JOHN LOOKED SOBER AGAIN ANYONE LIVE ON THE PLACE MAJOR HE INQUIRED
5390-30096-0033 IT'S GONE TO RUIN AND DECAY THE LAST FEW YEARS
5390-30102-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN LOUISE SCENTS A MYSTERY LOUISE MERRICK WAS THE ELDEST OF UNCLE JOHN'S NIECES HAVING JUST PASSED HER EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY
5390-30102-0001 LED A MERE BUTTERFLY EXISTENCE HER TWO COUSINS FRANKLY AGREED THAT LOUISE WAS SHALLOW INSINCERE AND INCLINED TO BE AFFECTED BUT OF THE THREE GIRLS
5390-30102-0002 AND MEN USUALLY ADMIRED HER GRACEFUL FIGURE AND HER PIQUANT PRETTY FACE WITH ITS CROWN OF FLUFFY BLONDE HAIR AND WINNING EXPRESSION THERE WAS A RUMOR THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED TO ARTHUR WELDON
5390-30102-0003 A YOUNG MAN OF POSITION IN THE CITY BUT UNCLE JOHN IGNORED THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING ONE OF HIS CHERISHED NIECES AND DECLARED THAT LOUISE WAS STILL TOO YOUNG TO THINK OF MARRIAGE WHEN AWAY FROM HER FRIVOLOUS MOTHER
5390-30102-0004 AND THE INCONSEQUENT HOME ENVIRONMENTS THE GIRL WAS MORE UNAFFECTED AND NATURAL IN HER WAYS AND HER FAULTS WERE DOUBTLESS MORE THE RESULT OF EDUCATION THAN OF NATURAL TENDENCY ONE THING WAS INDISPUTABLE HOWEVER
5390-30102-0005 LOUISE MERRICK WAS A CLEVER GIRL POSSESSING A QUICK INTELLECT AND A KEEN INSIGHT INTO THE CHARACTER OF OTHERS HER APPARENT SHALLOWNESS WAS A BLIND OF THE SAME CHARACTER AS HER ASSUMED GRACIOUSNESS
5390-30102-0006 AND WHILE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE LOVABLE WITHOUT ANY PRETENCE OR SHAM SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN LOUISE MERRICK AND ALLOW OTHERS TO READ HER AS SHE ACTUALLY WAS PATSY AND BETH THOUGHT THEY KNEW HER
5390-30102-0007 AND ADMIRED OR LIKED RATHER THAN LOVED THEIR COUSIN UNCLE JOHN THOUGHT HE KNEW HER TOO AND WAS VERY PROUD OF HIS ELDEST NIECE IN SPITE OF SOME DISCOVERED QUALITIES THAT WERE NOT WHOLLY ADMIRABLE
5390-30102-0008 AN EXTENSIVE COURSE OF LIGHT LITERATURE NOT VOID OF DETECTIVE STORIES HAD AT THIS MOMENT PRIMED LOUISE WITH ITS INFLUENCE TO THE EXTENT OF INDUCING HER TO SCENT A MYSTERY IN THE HISTORY OF CAPTAIN WEGG
5390-30102-0009 THE PLAIN FOLKS AROUND MILLVILLE MIGHT SPECULATE LISTLESSLY UPON THE QUEER DOIN'S AT THE FARM AND NEVER GET ANYWHERE NEAR THE TRUTH INDEED THE STRANGE OCCURRENCES SHE HAD JUST HEARD
5390-30102-0010 WERE NEARLY FORGOTTEN IN THE COMMUNITY AND SOON WOULD BE FORGOTTEN ALTOGETHER UNLESS THE QUICK EAR OF A YOUNG GIRL HAD CAUGHT THE CLUE SO LONG IGNORED AT FIRST SHE SCARCELY APPRECIATED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE UNDERTAKING
5390-30102-0011 IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT AN EFFORT TO READ TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA CAPTAIN'S ROMANCE WOULD BE A CHARMING DIVERSION WHILE SHE RESIDED AT MILLVILLE AND IN UNDERTAKING THE TASK SHE LAUGHINGLY ACCUSED HERSELF OF BECOMING AN AMATEUR DETECTIVE
5390-30102-0012 AN OCCUPATION THAT PROMISED TO BE THRILLING AND DELIGHTFUL WARNED HOWEVER BY THE REBUFF SHE HAD MET WITH FROM UNCLE JOHN THE GIRL DECIDED NOT TO CONFIDE EITHER HER SUSPICIONS OR HER PROPOSED INVESTIGATION TO ANYONE FOR THE PRESENT
5390-30102-0013 LOUISE SET TO WORK TO TABULATE THE INFORMATION SHE HAD RECEIVED THUS FAR NOTING THE ELEMENT OF MYSTERY EACH FACT EVOLVED FIRST CAPTAIN WEGG MUST HAVE BEEN A RICH MAN IN ORDER TO BUILD THIS HOUSE
5390-30102-0014 SECONDLY THE CAPTAIN A SURLY AND SILENT MAN HAD BROUGHT HITHER PERHAPS BY FORCE A YOUNG WOMAN AS HIS WIFE WHO WAS SO UNHAPPY THAT SHE PINED AWAY AND DIED WHO WAS THIS WOMAN
5390-30102-0015 WHAT HAD RENDERED HER SO UNHAPPY AND DESPAIRING THIRDLY THE CAPTAIN'S ONLY FRIEND HAD BEEN A CRAZY MAN NAMED WILL THOMPSON WAS HE CRAZY BEFORE THE CAPTAIN'S DEATH OR HAD HE BECOME CRAZED AT THAT TIME
5390-30102-0016 THE BOY FLED AND LEFT HIS SWEETHEART WITHOUT A WORD WHY UNLESS SOMETHING HAD OCCURRED THAT RENDERED THEIR MARRIAGE IMPOSSIBLE IN THE FIFTH PLACE THERE WAS OLD HUCKS AND HIS BLIND WIFE TO BE CONSIDERED
5390-30102-0017 WHAT DID THEY KNOW ABOUT THEIR OLD MASTER'S SECRET HISTORY WHAT TRAGIC MEMORIES LURKED BENEATH THE MAN'S PERPETUAL SMILE AND THE WOMAN'S COMPOSED AND SIGHTLESS FACE SURELY THERE WAS ENOUGH HERE TO EXCITE THE CURIOSITY
5390-30102-0018 AND WARRANT AN EFFORT TO UNTANGLE THE MYSTERY AND AS INSTRUMENTS TO THE END THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE AVAILABLE WHO COULD BE OF USE TO HER MC NUTT THE AGENT WHO EVIDENTLY KNEW MORE THAN HE HAD CARED TO TELL OLD HUCKS AND HIS WIFE
5390-30102-0019 AND ETHEL THOMPSON THE SCHOOL TEACHER THERE MIGHT BE OTHERS BUT ONE OR ANOTHER OF THESE FOUR MUST KNOW THE TRUTH AND IT WOULD BE HER PLEASANT DUTY TO OBTAIN A FULL DISCLOSURE SO SHE WAS ANXIOUS TO BEGIN HER INVESTIGATIONS AT ONCE
5390-30102-0020 WHEN HER UNCLE RETURNED FROM HIS VISIT TO THE PIGS LOUISE SAID TO HIM I'VE BEEN THINKING DEAR THAT WE OUGHT TO CALL UPON THAT YOUNG LADY WHO ARRANGED OUR ROOMS AND THANK HER FOR HER KINDNESS THAT'S TRUE HE REPLIED

5390-30102-0022 WHEN PATSY AND BETH WILL BE ABLE TO MEET HER THAT'S A GOOD IDEA LOUISE I WAS WONDERING WHAT I'D DO THIS MORNING TELL OLD HUCKS TO GET THE NAG HARNESSED THE GIRL RAN EAGERLY UPON HER ERRAND
5390-30102-0023 BUT HE TURNED WITHOUT A WORD TO HARNESS THE HORSE LOUISE STOOD WATCHING HIM YOUR FINGERS ARE QUITE NIMBLE THOMAS CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT YOU WERE ONCE A SAILOR SHE SAID BUT SAILORS HAVE TO BE NIMBLE MISS HE RETURNED
5390-30102-0024 BUCKLING A STRAP UNMOVED WHO TOL YE I WERE ONCE A SEA FARIN MAN I GUESSED IT AS HE APPEARED INDISPOSED TO SAY MORE ON THE SUBJECT SHE ASKED DID YOU SAIL WITH CAPTAIN WEGG PARTLY MISS DAN'S ALREADY NOW

5390-30102-0026 DAN GROANED AND AMBLED SLOWLY AROUND TO WHERE UNCLE JOHN STOOD AWAITING HIS NIECE
5390-30102-0027 I UNDERSTAND DAN WELL I DON'T RETURNED UNCLE JOHN IN HIS WHIMSICAL WAY AS HE MOUNTED TO THE SEAT BESIDE HER I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW HE'S HAPPENED TO LIVE SINCE THE LANDING OF COLUMBUS OR WHAT HE'S GOOD FOR
5390-30102-0028 OR WHY SOMEONE DON'T KNOCK HIM ON THE HEAD DAN TURNED HIS LONG LEAN FACE AS IF TO GIVE THE SPEAKER A REPROACHFUL LOOK THEN HE GROANED AGAIN LEANED FORWARD AND DREW THE BUGGY SLOWLY INTO THE STONY LANE
5390-30102-0029 DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE THOMPSONS LIVE INQUIRED UNCLE JOHN NO WHOA DAN THAT WAS THE BEST THING THE NAG DID HE KNEW HOW TO WHOA THOMAS CALLED UNCLE JOHN TURNING IN HIS SEAT
5390-30102-0030 AND AT THE SUMMONS OLD HUCKS CAME FROM THE BARN AND APPROACHED THEM HOW DO YOU GET TO MISS THOMPSON'S PLACE MISS ETHEL'S ANOTHER FLEETING EXPRESSION OF SURPRISE YES WE'RE GOING OVER TO THANK HER FOR HER KINDNESS TO US
5390-30102-0031 THOMPSON'S STAMMERED HUCKS GLANCING UP AT THEM WITH HIS BRIGHT ELUSIVE SMILE WELL WE'RE GOING ANYHOW GROWLED MISTER MERRICK
5393-19218-0000 THE NIGHT OF THE SIXTEENTH TO THE SEVENTEENTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE WAS A BLESSED NIGHT ABOVE ITS SHADOWS HEAVEN STOOD OPEN IT WAS THE WEDDING NIGHT OF MARIUS AND COSETTE THE DAY HAD BEEN ADORABLE
5393-19218-0001 IT HAD NOT BEEN THE GRAND FESTIVAL DREAMED BY THE GRANDFATHER A FAIRY SPECTACLE WITH A CONFUSION OF CHERUBIM AND CUPIDS OVER THE HEADS OF THE BRIDAL PAIR A MARRIAGE WORTHY TO FORM THE SUBJECT OF A PAINTING TO BE PLACED OVER A DOOR BUT IT HAD BEEN SWEET AND SMILING
5393-19218-0002 THE MANNER OF MARRIAGE IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE WAS NOT THE SAME AS IT IS TO DAY FRANCE HAD NOT YET BORROWED FROM ENGLAND THAT SUPREME DELICACY OF CARRYING OFF ONE'S WIFE OF FLEEING
5393-19218-0003 ON COMING OUT OF CHURCH OF HIDING ONESELF WITH SHAME FROM ONE'S HAPPINESS AND OF COMBINING THE WAYS OF A BANKRUPT WITH THE DELIGHTS OF THE SONG OF SONGS PEOPLE HAD NOT YET GRASPED TO THE FULL THE CHASTITY EXQUISITENESS
5393-19218-0004 THE MOST SACRED OF THE SOUVENIRS OF LIFE MINGLED PELL MELL WITH THE TETE A TETE OF THE CONDUCTOR OF THE DILIGENCE AND THE MAID SERVANT OF THE INN IN THIS SECOND HALF OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IN WHICH WE ARE NOW LIVING THE MAYOR AND HIS SCARF THE PRIEST
5393-19218-0005 OATHS TO THE NORMAN HORSES WITH THEIR TAILS KNOTTED UP FALSE GALLOONS VARNISHED HAT LONG POWDERED LOCKS AN ENORMOUS WHIP AND TALL BOOTS FRANCE DOES NOT YET CARRY ELEGANCE TO THE LENGTH OF DOING LIKE THE ENGLISH NOBILITY
5393-19218-0006 AND RAINING DOWN ON THE POST CHAISE OF THE BRIDAL PAIR A HAIL STORM OF SLIPPERS TRODDEN DOWN AT HEEL AND OF WORN OUT SHOES IN MEMORY OF CHURCHILL
5393-19218-0007 WHICH BROUGHT HIM GOOD LUCK OLD SHOES AND SLIPPERS DO NOT AS YET FORM A PART OF OUR NUPTIAL CELEBRATIONS BUT PATIENCE AS GOOD TASTE CONTINUES TO SPREAD WE SHALL COME TO THAT IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO
5393-19218-0008 MARRIAGE WAS NOT CONDUCTED AT A FULL TROT STRANGE TO SAY AT THAT EPOCH PEOPLE STILL IMAGINED THAT A WEDDING WAS A PRIVATE AND SOCIAL FESTIVAL THAT A PATRIARCHAL BANQUET DOES NOT SPOIL A DOMESTIC SOLEMNITY THAT GAYETY EVEN IN EXCESS
5393-19218-0009 PROVIDED IT BE HONEST AND DECENT DOES HAPPINESS NO HARM AND THAT IN SHORT IT IS A GOOD AND A VENERABLE THING THAT THE FUSION OF THESE TWO DESTINIES WHENCE A FAMILY IS DESTINED TO SPRING SHOULD BEGIN AT HOME AND THAT THE HOUSEHOLD SHOULD THENCEFORTH
5393-19218-0010 NATURAL AND COMMONPLACE AS THIS MATTER OF MARRYING IS THE BANNS TO PUBLISH THE PAPERS TO BE DRAWN UP THE MAYORALTY AND THE CHURCH PRODUCE SOME COMPLICATION THEY COULD NOT GET READY BEFORE THE SIXTEENTH OF FEBRUARY
5393-19218-0011 NOW WE NOTE THIS DETAIL FOR THE PURE SATISFACTION OF BEING EXACT IT CHANCED
5393-19218-0012 AS THE MARRIAGE WAS TAKING PLACE UNDER THE REGIME OF COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY THE PAPERS HAD BEEN SIMPLE
5393-19218-0013 AN ACCIDENT HAPPENED TO JEAN VALJEAN HE CRUSHED THE THUMB OF HIS RIGHT HAND
5393-19218-0014 NOR EVEN TO SEE HIS HURT NOT EVEN COSETTE NEVERTHELESS THIS HAD FORCED HIM TO SWATHE HIS HAND IN A LINEN BANDAGE AND TO CARRY HIS ARM IN A SLING AND HAD PREVENTED HIS SIGNING M GILLENORMAND
5393-19218-0015 IN HIS CAPACITY OF COSETTE'S SUPERVISING GUARDIAN HAD SUPPLIED HIS PLACE WE WILL NOT CONDUCT THE READER EITHER TO THE MAYOR'S OFFICE OR TO THE CHURCH ONE DOES NOT FOLLOW A PAIR OF LOVERS TO THAT EXTENT
5393-19218-0016 TO THE CHURCH OF SAINT PAUL AT THAT EPOCH
5393-19218-0017 WAS IN PROCESS OF REPAVING IT WAS BARRED OFF
5393-19218-0018 AND JEAN VALJEAN MARIUS STILL SEPARATED FROM HIS BETROTHED ACCORDING TO USAGE DID NOT COME UNTIL THE SECOND
5393-19218-0019 BECAME ENTANGLED IN A LONG PROCESSION OF VEHICLES WHICH FORMED AN ENDLESS CHAIN FROM THE MADELEINE TO THE BASTILLE AND FROM THE BASTILLE TO THE MADELEINE MASKERS ABOUNDED ON THE BOULEVARD
5393-19218-0020 MERRY ANDREW PANTALOON AND CLOWN PERSISTED IN THE GOOD HUMOR OF THAT WINTER OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE PARIS HAD DISGUISED ITSELF AS VENICE SUCH SHROVE TUESDAYS ARE NO LONGER TO BE SEEN NOW A DAYS
5393-19218-0021 ANY ONE IN THESE VEHICLES IS AT ONCE A SPECTATOR AND A SPECTACLE POLICE SERGEANTS MAINTAINED ON THE SIDES OF THE BOULEVARD THESE TWO INTERMINABLE PARALLEL FILES MOVING IN CONTRARY DIRECTIONS AND SAW TO IT THAT NOTHING INTERFERED WITH THAT DOUBLE CURRENT
5393-19218-0022 THOSE TWO BROOKS OF CARRIAGES FLOWING THE ONE DOWN STREAM THE OTHER UP STREAM
5393-19218-0023 EMBLAZONED WITH COATS OF ARMS HELD THE MIDDLE OF THE WAY GOING AND COMING FREELY CERTAIN JOYOUS AND MAGNIFICENT TRAINS NOTABLY
5393-19218-0024 HAD THE SAME PRIVILEGE IN THIS GAYETY OF PARIS ENGLAND CRACKED HER WHIP LORD SEYMOUR'S POST CHAISE HARASSED BY A NICKNAME FROM THE POPULACE PASSED WITH GREAT NOISE IN THE DOUBLE FILE ALONG WHICH THE MUNICIPAL GUARDS GALLOPED LIKE SHEEP DOGS
5393-19218-0025 HONEST FAMILY COACHES LOADED DOWN WITH GREAT AUNTS AND GRANDMOTHERS DISPLAYED AT THEIR DOORS FRESH GROUPS OF CHILDREN IN DISGUISE CLOWNS OF SEVEN YEARS OF AGE COLUMBINES OF SIX RAVISHING LITTLE CREATURES WHO FELT THAT THEY FORMED AN OFFICIAL PART OF THE PUBLIC MIRTH
5393-19218-0026 ONE CARRIAGE DELAYED SUFFICED TO PARALYZE THE WHOLE LINE THEN THEY SET OUT AGAIN ON THE MARCH THE WEDDING CARRIAGES WERE IN THE FILE PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE BASTILLE AND SKIRTING THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BOULEVARD
5393-19218-0027 NEARLY AT THE SAME MOMENT THE OTHER FILE WHICH WAS PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE MADELEINE HALTED ALSO AT THAT POINT OF THE FILE THERE WAS A CARRIAGE LOAD OF MASKERS THESE CARRIAGES OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY THESE WAGON LOADS OF MASKERS
5393-19218-0028 ARE VERY FAMILIAR TO PARISIANS IF THEY WERE MISSING ON A SHROVE TUESDAY OR AT THE MID LENT IT WOULD BE TAKEN IN BAD PART AND PEOPLE WOULD SAY THERE'S SOMETHING BEHIND THAT PROBABLY THE MINISTRY IS ABOUT TO UNDERGO A CHANGE
5393-19218-0029 TOW WIGS PINK TIGHTS DANDIFIED HATS SPECTACLES OF A GRIMACER
5393-19218-0030 TORMENTED WITH A BUTTERFLY SHOUTS DIRECTED AT PEDESTRIANS FISTS ON HIPS BOLD ATTITUDES BARE SHOULDERS IMMODESTY UNCHAINED A CHAOS OF SHAMELESSNESS DRIVEN BY A COACHMAN CROWNED WITH FLOWERS
5393-19218-0031 THIS IS WHAT THAT INSTITUTION WAS LIKE GREECE STOOD IN NEED OF THE CHARIOT OF THESPIS FRANCE STANDS IN NEED OF THE HACKNEY COACH OF VADE EVERYTHING CAN BE PARODIED EVEN PARODY THE SATURNALIA
5393-19218-0032 DISPLAYING HER MARBLE BREAST IN A DIVINE SEMI NUDITY HAVING AT THE PRESENT DAY LOST HER SHAPE UNDER THE SOAKED RAGS OF THE NORTH HAS FINALLY COME TO BE CALLED THE JACK PUDDING THE TRADITION OF CARRIAGE LOADS OF MASKERS RUNS BACK TO THE MOST ANCIENT DAYS OF THE MONARCHY
5393-19218-0033 ALLOT TO THE BAILIFF OF THE PALACE TWENTY SOUS TOURNOIS FOR THREE COACHES OF MASCARADES IN THE CROSS ROADS IN OUR DAY THESE NOISY HEAPS OF CREATURES ARE ACCUSTOMED TO HAVE THEMSELVES DRIVEN IN SOME ANCIENT CUCKOO CARRIAGE WHOSE IMPERIAL THEY LOAD DOWN
5393-19218-0034 OR THEY OVERWHELM A HIRED LANDAU WITH ITS TOP THROWN BACK WITH THEIR TUMULTUOUS GROUPS TWENTY OF THEM RIDE IN A CARRIAGE INTENDED FOR SIX THEY CLING TO THE SEATS TO THE RUMBLE ON THE CHEEKS OF THE HOOD ON THE SHAFTS
5393-19218-0035 ENRICHED WITH SLANG THIS CARRIAGE WHICH HAS BECOME COLOSSAL THROUGH ITS FREIGHT HAS AN AIR OF CONQUEST UPROAR REIGNS IN FRONT TUMULT BEHIND PEOPLE VOCIFERATE SHOUT HOWL
5393-19218-0036 GAYETY ROARS SARCASM FLAMES FORTH JOVIALITY IS FLAUNTED LIKE A RED FLAG TWO JADES THERE DRAG FARCE BLOSSOMED FORTH INTO AN APOTHEOSIS IT IS THE TRIUMPHAL CAR OF LAUGHTER A LAUGHTER THAT IS TOO CYNICAL TO BE FRANK
5393-19218-0037 THERE IS GOVERNMENT THEREIN THERE ONE LAYS ONE'S FINGER ON A MYSTERIOUS AFFINITY BETWEEN PUBLIC MEN AND PUBLIC WOMEN IT CERTAINLY IS SAD THAT TURPITUDE HEAPED UP SHOULD GIVE A SUM TOTAL OF GAYETY
5393-19218-0038 THAT BY PILING IGNOMINY UPON OPPROBRIUM THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE ENTICED THAT THE SYSTEM OF SPYING AND SERVING AS CARYATIDS TO PROSTITUTION SHOULD AMUSE THE RABBLE WHEN IT CONFRONTS THEM
5393-19218-0039 THAT THE CROWD LOVES TO BEHOLD THAT MONSTROUS LIVING PILE OF TINSEL RAGS HALF DUNG HALF LIGHT ROLL BY ON FOUR WHEELS HOWLING AND LAUGHING THAT THEY SHOULD CLAP THEIR HANDS AT THIS GLORY COMPOSED OF ALL SHAMES
5393-19218-0040 THE LAUGHTER OF ALL IS THE ACCOMPLICE OF UNIVERSAL DEGRADATION CERTAIN UNHEALTHY FESTIVALS DISAGGREGATE THE PEOPLE AND CONVERT THEM INTO THE POPULACE AND POPULACES LIKE TYRANTS REQUIRE BUFFOONS THE KING HAS ROQUELAURE
5393-19218-0041 THE POPULACE HAS THE MERRY ANDREW PARIS IS A GREAT MAD CITY ON EVERY OCCASION THAT IT IS A GREAT SUBLIME CITY THERE THE CARNIVAL FORMS PART OF POLITICS PARIS LET US CONFESS IT WILLINGLY ALLOWS INFAMY TO FURNISH IT WITH COMEDY
5393-19218-0042 SHE ONLY DEMANDS OF HER MASTERS WHEN SHE HAS MASTERS ONE THING PAINT ME THE MUD ROME WAS OF THE SAME MIND SHE LOVED NERO NERO WAS A TITANIC LIGHTERMAN
5393-19218-0043 THAT ONE OF THESE SHAPELESS CLUSTERS OF MASKED MEN AND WOMEN DRAGGED ABOUT ON A VAST CALASH SHOULD HALT ON THE LEFT OF THE BOULEVARD WHILE THE WEDDING TRAIN HALTED ON THE RIGHT THE CARRIAGE LOAD OF MASKS
5393-19218-0044 CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE WEDDING CARRIAGE CONTAINING THE BRIDAL PARTY OPPOSITE THEM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BOULEVARD HULLO SAID A MASKER HERE'S A WEDDING A SHAM WEDDING RETORTED ANOTHER WE ARE THE GENUINE ARTICLE AND BEING TOO FAR OFF TO ACCOST THE WEDDING PARTY
5393-19218-0045 AND FEARING ALSO THE REBUKE OF THE POLICE THE TWO MASKERS TURNED THEIR EYES ELSEWHERE AT THE END OF ANOTHER MINUTE THE CARRIAGE LOAD OF MASKERS HAD THEIR HANDS FULL THE MULTITUDE SET TO YELLING WHICH IS THE CROWD'S CARESS TO MASQUERADES
5393-19218-0046 AND THE TWO MASKERS WHO HAD JUST SPOKEN HAD TO FACE THE THRONG WITH THEIR COMRADES AND DID NOT FIND THE ENTIRE REPERTORY OF PROJECTILES OF THE FISHMARKETS TOO EXTENSIVE TO RETORT TO THE ENORMOUS VERBAL ATTACKS OF THE POPULACE A FRIGHTFUL EXCHANGE OF METAPHORS TOOK PLACE
5393-19218-0047 IN THE MEANWHILE TWO OTHER MASKERS IN THE SAME CARRIAGE A SPANIARD WITH AN ENORMOUS NOSE AN ELDERLY AIR AND HUGE BLACK MOUSTACHE AND A GAUNT FISHWIFE WHO WAS QUITE A YOUNG GIRL

5393-19219-0006 AFTER HAVING PRONOUNCED BEFORE THE MAYOR AND BEFORE THE PRIEST ALL POSSIBLE YESSES
5393-19219-0007 AND ALL BEING FINISHED COSETTE STILL COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT IT WAS REAL SHE LOOKED AT MARIUS SHE LOOKED AT THE CROWD SHE LOOKED AT THE SKY IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SHE FEARED THAT SHE SHOULD WAKE UP FROM HER DREAM
5393-19219-0008 MARIUS BESIDE COSETTE
5393-19219-0009 AND JEAN VALJEAN SAT OPPOSITE THEM AUNT GILLENORMAND HAD WITHDRAWN ONE DEGREE AND WAS IN THE SECOND VEHICLE MY CHILDREN SAID THE GRANDFATHER HERE YOU ARE MONSIEUR LE BARON
5393-19219-0010 AND COSETTE NESTLING CLOSE TO MARIUS CARESSED HIS EAR WITH AN ANGELIC WHISPER SO IT IS TRUE MY NAME IS MARIUS I AM MADAME THOU THESE TWO CREATURES WERE RESPLENDENT
5393-19219-0011 AND IRRECOVERABLE MOMENT AT THE DAZZLING INTERSECTION OF ALL YOUTH AND ALL JOY THEY REALIZED THE VERSES OF JEAN PROUVAIRE THEY WERE FORTY YEARS OLD TAKEN TOGETHER IT WAS MARRIAGE SUBLIMATED
5393-19219-0012 THESE TWO CHILDREN WERE TWO LILIES THEY DID NOT SEE EACH OTHER THEY DID NOT CONTEMPLATE EACH OTHER COSETTE PERCEIVED MARIUS IN THE MIDST OF A GLORY MARIUS PERCEIVED COSETTE ON AN ALTAR AND ON THAT ALTAR
5393-19219-0013 AND IN THAT GLORY THE TWO APOTHEOSES MINGLING IN THE BACKGROUND ONE KNOWS NOT HOW BEHIND A CLOUD FOR COSETTE IN A FLASH FOR MARIUS THERE WAS THE IDEAL THING THE REAL THING THE MEETING OF THE KISS AND THE DREAM
5393-19219-0014 THE NUPTIAL PILLOW ALL THE TORMENTS THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD PASSED CAME BACK TO THEM IN INTOXICATION IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT THEIR SORROWS THEIR SLEEPLESS NIGHTS THEIR TEARS THEIR ANGUISH THEIR TERRORS
5393-19219-0015 THEIR UNHAPPINESS FORMED A HALO ROUND THEIR HAPPINESS THE LONG AGONY OF THEIR LOVE WAS TERMINATING IN AN ASCENSION IT WAS THE SAME ENCHANTMENT IN TWO SOULS
5393-19219-0016 AND WITH MODESTY IN COSETTE THEY SAID TO EACH OTHER IN LOW TONES WE WILL GO BACK TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR LITTLE GARDEN IN THE RUE PLUMET THE FOLDS OF COSETTE'S GOWN LAY ACROSS MARIUS
5393-19219-0017 ONE POSSESSES AND ONE SUPPOSES ONE STILL HAS TIME BEFORE ONE TO DIVINE THE EMOTION ON THAT DAY OF BEING AT MID DAY AND OF DREAMING OF MIDNIGHT IS INDESCRIBABLE THE DELIGHTS OF THESE TWO HEARTS OVERFLOWED UPON THE CROWD
5393-19219-0018 AND INSPIRED THE PASSERS BY WITH CHEERFULNESS
5393-19219-0019 IN FRONT OF SAINT PAUL TO GAZE THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF THE CARRIAGE AT THE ORANGE FLOWERS QUIVERING ON COSETTE'S HEAD THEN THEY RETURNED HOME
5393-19219-0020 THEY BEHELD THE LIGHT OF A RISING SUN ALL AT ONCE THE CLOCK STRUCK MARIUS GLANCED AT COSETTE'S CHARMING BARE ARM AND AT THE ROSY THINGS WHICH WERE VAGUELY VISIBLE THROUGH THE LACE OF HER BODICE AND COSETTE
5393-19219-0021 BLUSHED TO HER VERY HAIR
5393-19219-0022 THEY PRESSED ABOUT COSETTE EACH ONE VIED WITH THE REST IN SALUTING HER

5393-19219-0057 THERE WAS A TUMULT THEN SILENCE THE MARRIED PAIR DISAPPEARED A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT
5393-19219-0058 HERE WE PAUSE ON THE THRESHOLD OF WEDDING NIGHTS STANDS A SMILING ANGEL WITH HIS FINGER ON HIS LIPS THE SOUL ENTERS INTO CONTEMPLATION BEFORE THAT SANCTUARY WHERE THE CELEBRATION OF LOVE TAKES PLACE THERE SHOULD BE FLASHES OF LIGHT ATHWART SUCH HOUSES

5463-39173-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE WHY PUCK THE PONY WAS BEATEN MARK ROBARTS RETURNED HOME THE DAY AFTER THE SCENE AT THE ALBANY CONSIDERABLY RELIEVED IN SPIRIT
5463-39173-0001 INDEED AFTER WHAT MISTER SOWERBY HAD SAID AND AFTER LORD LUFTON'S ASSENT TO IT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS HE CONSIDERED TO DECLINE IT AND THEN TOO MISTER SOWERBY'S PROMISE ABOUT THE BILLS WAS VERY COMFORTABLE TO HIM AFTER ALL
5463-39173-0002 ON THE DAY AFTER HIS RETURN HE RECEIVED PROPER AUTHENTIC TIDINGS OF HIS PRESENTATION TO THE PREBEND HE WAS IN FACT ALREADY PREBENDARY
5463-39173-0003 THE INCOME WAS ALREADY HIS OWN
5463-39173-0004 THE ENJOYMENT OF ONE'S OWN HAPPINESS AT SUCH WINDFALLS DEPENDS SO MUCH ON THE FREE AND FREELY EXPRESSED ENJOYMENT OF OTHERS LADY LUFTON'S CONGRATULATIONS HAD NEARLY MADE HIM THROW UP THE WHOLE THING BUT HIS WIFE'S SMILES RE ENCOURAGED HIM
5463-39173-0005 AND LUCY'S WARM AND EAGER JOY MADE HIM FEEL QUITE DELIGHTED WITH MISTER SOWERBY AND THE DUKE OF OMNIUM AND THEN THAT SPLENDID ANIMAL DANDY CAME HOME TO THE PARSONAGE STABLES MUCH TO THE DELIGHT OF THE GROOM AND GARDENER
5463-39173-0006 WHICH HE HAD BOUGHT FROM MISTER SOWERBY SOME LITTLE TIME SINCE WITH THE OBJECT OF OBLIGING HIM HE MARK INTENDED TO SELL HIM AGAIN AS SOON AS HE COULD DO SO JUDICIOUSLY THIS AS I HAVE SAID ABOVE WAS NOT SATISFACTORY
5463-39173-0007 NEITHER OF THE TWO LADIES AT FRAMLEY PARSONAGE KNEW MUCH ABOUT HORSES OR OF THE MANNER IN WHICH ONE GENTLEMAN MIGHT THINK IT PROPER TO OBLIGE ANOTHER BY PURCHASING THE SUPERFLUITIES OF HIS STABLE BUT THEY DID BOTH FEEL THAT THERE WERE HORSES ENOUGH IN THE PARSONAGE STABLE WITHOUT DANDY
5463-39173-0008 AND THAT THE PURCHASING OF A HUNTER WITH THE VIEW OF IMMEDIATELY SELLING HIM AGAIN WAS TO SAY THE LEAST OF IT AN OPERATION HARDLY CONGENIAL WITH THE USUAL TASTES AND PURSUITS OF A CLERGYMAN I HOPE YOU DID NOT GIVE VERY MUCH MONEY FOR HIM MARK SAID FANNY
5463-39173-0009 NOT MORE THAN I SHALL GET AGAIN SAID MARK
5463-39173-0010 I SUPPOSE I SHALL HAVE TO GO INTO RESIDENCE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SAID MARK RECURRING TO THE MORE AGREEABLE SUBJECT OF THE STALL
5463-39173-0011 THE HOUSE WILL NOT BE FURNISHED WILL IT MARK SAID HIS WIFE I DON'T KNOW HOW WE SHALL GET ON DON'T FRIGHTEN YOURSELVES I SHALL TAKE LODGINGS IN BARCHESTER AND WE SHALL NOT SEE YOU ALL THE TIME SAID MISSUS ROBARTS WITH DISMAY
5463-39173-0012 BUT THE PREBENDARY EXPLAINED THAT HE WOULD BE BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AT FRAMLEY EVERY WEEK AND THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY HE WOULD ONLY SLEEP AT BARCHESTER ON THE SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS AND PERHAPS NOT ALWAYS THEN
5463-39173-0013 THE WORST OF IT IS THAT BOTH OF THEM ARE OBLIGED TO WEAR WIGS SHALL YOU HAVE A HAT MARK WITH CURLY THINGS AT THE SIDE AND STRINGS THROUGH TO HOLD THEM UP ASKED LUCY I FEAR THAT DOES NOT COME WITHIN MY PERQUISITES NOR A ROSETTE
5463-39173-0014 IT WAS NOW THE MONTH OF APRIL AND THE FIELDS WERE BEGINNING TO LOOK GREEN AND THE WIND HAD GOT ITSELF OUT OF THE EAST AND WAS SOFT AND GENIAL AND THE EARLY SPRING FLOWERS WERE SHOWING THEIR BRIGHT COLOURS IN THE PARSONAGE GARDEN AND ALL THINGS WERE SWEET AND PLEASANT
5463-39173-0015 WENT AWAY WHEN THE SPRING CAME LEAVING THEIR HOUSES INNOCENT AND EMPTY THE PARISH DUTY WAS BETTER ATTENDED TO AND PERHAPS DOMESTIC DUTIES ALSO AT SUCH PERIOD HE WAS A PATTERN PARSON AND A PATTERN HUSBAND
5463-39173-0016 ATONING TO HIS OWN CONSCIENCE FOR PAST SHORTCOMINGS BY PRESENT ZEAL AND THEN THOUGH SHE HAD NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED IT TO HERSELF THE ABSENCE OF HER DEAR FRIEND LADY LUFTON WAS PERHAPS IN ITSELF NOT DISAGREEABLE MISSUS ROBARTS DID LOVE LADY LUFTON HEARTILY
5463-39173-0017 INDEED JUST AT THIS MOMENT
5463-39173-0018 DANDY WAS RATHER A THORN IN HIS SIDE THOSE WRETCHED BILLS WERE TO COME DUE EARLY IN MAY AND BEFORE THE END OF APRIL SOWERBY WROTE TO HIM SAYING THAT HE WAS DOING HIS UTMOST TO PROVIDE FOR THE EVIL DAY
5463-39173-0019 BUT THAT IF THE PRICE OF DANDY COULD BE REMITTED TO HIM AT ONCE IT WOULD GREATLY FACILITATE HIS OBJECT NOTHING COULD BE MORE DIFFERENT THAN MISTER SOWERBY'S TONE ABOUT MONEY AT DIFFERENT TIMES WHEN HE WANTED TO RAISE THE WIND EVERYTHING WAS SO IMPORTANT
5463-39173-0020 HASTE AND SUPERHUMAN EFFORTS AND MEN RUNNING TO AND FRO WITH BLANK ACCEPTANCES IN THEIR HANDS COULD ALONE STAVE OFF THE CRACK OF DOOM BUT AT OTHER TIMES WHEN RETALIATORY APPLICATIONS WERE MADE TO HIM
5463-39173-0021 HE COULD PROVE WITH THE EASIEST VOICE AND MOST JAUNTY MANNER THAT EVERYTHING WAS QUITE SERENE NOW AT THIS PERIOD HE WAS IN THAT MOOD OF SUPERHUMAN EFFORTS AND HE CALLED LOUDLY FOR THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS FOR DANDY AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED
5463-39173-0022 MARK COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO SAY THAT HE WOULD PAY NOTHING TILL THE BILLS WERE SAFE AND THEREFORE WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF MISTER FORREST OF THE BANK HE DID REMIT THE PRICE OF DANDY TO HIS FRIEND SOWERBY IN LONDON AND LUCY ROBARTS
5463-39173-0023 SHE HAD DECLARED TO HIM PLAINLY THAT SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM AND COULD NOT LOVE HIM AND HAD THUS THROWN AWAY NOT ONLY RICHES AND HONOUR AND HIGH STATION BUT MORE THAN THAT MUCH WORSE THAN THAT SHE HAD FLUNG AWAY FROM HER THE LOVER TO WHOSE LOVE HER WARM HEART CLUNG
5463-39173-0024 THAT HER LOVE DID CLING TO HIM SHE KNEW EVEN THEN AND OWNED MORE THOROUGHLY AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE SO MUCH HER PRIDE HAD DONE FOR HER AND THAT STRONG RESOLVE THAT LADY LUFTON SHOULD NOT SCOWL ON HER AND TELL HER THAT SHE HAD ENTRAPPED HER SON
5463-39173-0025 I KNOW IT WILL BE SAID OF LORD LUFTON HIMSELF THAT PUTTING ASIDE HIS PEERAGE AND BROAD ACRES AND HANDSOME SONSY FACE HE WAS NOT WORTH A GIRL'S CARE AND LOVE
5463-39173-0026 BUT WHAT WOULD THE WORLD COME TO IF NONE BUT ABSOLUTE TRUE HEROES WERE TO BE THOUGHT WORTHY OF WOMEN'S LOVE WHAT WOULD THE MEN DO AND WHAT OH WHAT WOULD BECOME OF THE WOMEN
5463-39173-0027 LUCY ROBARTS IN HER HEART DID NOT GIVE HER DISMISSED LOVER CREDIT FOR MUCH MORE HEROISM THAN DID TRULY APPERTAIN TO HIM DID NOT PERHAPS GIVE HIM FULL CREDIT FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HEROISM WHICH DID REALLY APPERTAIN TO HIM
5463-39173-0028 TREATS HERSELF AS A FARMER TREATS HIS SHEEP AND OXEN MAKES HARDLY MORE OF HERSELF OF HER OWN INNER SELF IN WHICH ARE COMPRISED A MIND AND SOUL THAN THE POOR WRETCH OF HER OWN SEX WHO EARNS HER BREAD IN THE LOWEST STAGE OF DEGRADATION
5463-39173-0029 BUT A TITLE AND AN ESTATE AND AN INCOME ARE MATTERS WHICH WILL WEIGH IN THE BALANCE WITH ALL EVE'S DAUGHTERS AS THEY DO WITH ALL ADAM'S SONS PRIDE OF PLACE AND THE POWER OF LIVING WELL IN FRONT OF THE WORLD'S EYE ARE DEAR TO US ALL ARE DOUBTLESS INTENDED TO BE DEAR
5463-39173-0030 THE MISTRESS OF SUCH A DESTINY WHAT MORE OR WHAT BETTER COULD THE WORLD HAVE DONE FOR HER AND NOW SHE HAD THROWN ALL THAT ASIDE BECAUSE SHE WOULD NOT ENDURE THAT LADY LUFTON SHOULD CALL HER A SCHEMING ARTFUL GIRL ACTUATED BY THAT FEAR SHE HAD REPULSED HIM WITH A FALSEHOOD
5463-39173-0031 THOUGH THE MATTER WAS ONE ON WHICH IT WAS SO TERRIBLY EXPEDIENT THAT SHE SHOULD TELL THE TRUTH AND YET SHE WAS CHEERFUL WITH HER BROTHER AND SISTER IN LAW
5463-39173-0032 IT WAS WHEN SHE WAS QUITE ALONE AT NIGHT IN HER OWN ROOM OR IN HER SOLITARY WALKS THAT A SINGLE SILENT TEAR WOULD GATHER IN THE CORNER OF HER EYE AND GRADUALLY MOISTEN HER EYELIDS SHE NEVER TOLD HER LOVE NOR DID SHE ALLOW CONCEALMENT TO FEED ON HER DAMASK CHEEK
5463-39173-0033 IN ALL HER EMPLOYMENTS IN HER WAYS ABOUT THE HOUSE AND HER ACCUSTOMED QUIET MIRTH SHE WAS THE SAME AS EVER IN THIS SHE SHOWED THE PECULIAR STRENGTH WHICH GOD HAD GIVEN HER BUT NOT THE LESS DID SHE IN TRUTH MOURN FOR HER LOST LOVE AND SPOILED AMBITION
5463-39173-0034 WE ARE GOING TO DRIVE OVER TO HOGGLESTOCK THIS MORNING FANNY SAID ONE DAY AT BREAKFAST I SUPPOSE MARK YOU WON'T GO WITH US
5463-39173-0035 THE PONY CARRIAGE IS WRETCHED FOR THREE OH AS FOR THAT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE NEW HORSE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CARRY YOU AS FAR AS THAT I HEARD YOU SAY YOU WANTED TO SEE MISTER CRAWLEY SO I DO AND THE NEW HORSE AS YOU CALL HIM SHALL CARRY ME THERE TO MORROW
5463-39173-0036 WILL YOU SAY THAT I'LL BE OVER ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK YOU HAD BETTER SAY EARLIER AS HE IS ALWAYS OUT ABOUT THE PARISH VERY WELL SAY ELEVEN IT IS PARISH BUSINESS ABOUT WHICH I AM GOING SO IT NEED NOT IRK HIS CONSCIENCE TO STAY IN FOR ME
5463-39173-0037 WELL LUCY WE MUST DRIVE OURSELVES THAT'S ALL YOU SHALL BE CHARIOTEER GOING AND THEN WE'LL CHANGE COMING BACK TO ALL WHICH LUCY AGREED AND AS SOON AS THEIR WORK IN THE SCHOOL WAS OVER THEY STARTED
5463-39173-0038 NOT A WORD HAD BEEN SPOKEN BETWEEN THEM ABOUT LORD LUFTON SINCE THAT EVENING NOW MORE THAN A MONTH AGO ON WHICH THEY HAD BEEN WALKING TOGETHER IN THE GARDEN LUCY HAD SO DEMEANED HERSELF ON THAT OCCASION
5463-39173-0039 AS TO MAKE HER SISTER IN LAW QUITE SURE THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO LOVE PASSAGES UP TO THAT TIME AND NOTHING HAD SINCE OCCURRED WHICH HAD CREATED ANY SUSPICION IN MISSUS ROBARTS MIND SHE HAD SEEN AT ONCE THAT ALL THE CLOSE INTIMACY BETWEEN THEM WAS OVER AND THOUGHT THAT EVERYTHING WAS AS IT SHOULD BE
5463-39173-0040 BUT SHE DID NOT BETRAY HERSELF PERHAPS HE MAY SHE SAID AND THEN GAVE THE PONY A LITTLE TOUCH WITH HER WHIP OH LUCY I WON'T HAVE PUCK BEATEN HE WAS GOING VERY NICELY I BEG PUCK'S PARDON
5463-39173-0041 BUT YOU SEE WHEN ONE IS TRUSTED WITH A WHIP ONE FEELS SUCH A LONGING TO USE IT OH BUT YOU SHOULD KEEP IT STILL I FEEL ALMOST CERTAIN THAT LADY LUFTON WOULD LIKE SUCH A MATCH I DARESAY SHE MIGHT MISS GRANTLY WILL HAVE A LARGE FORTUNE I BELIEVE
5463-39173-0042 AND THEN SHE IS QUIET AND RESERVED SHE DOES NOT REQUIRE EXCITEMENT AND I AM SURE IS CONSCIENTIOUS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HER DUTIES VERY CONSCIENTIOUS I HAVE NO DOUBT SAID LUCY WITH SOMETHING LIKE A SNEER IN HER TONE BUT THE QUESTION I SUPPOSE IS
5463-39173-0043 WHETHER LORD LUFTON LIKES HER I THINK HE DOES IN A SORT OF WAY HE DID NOT TALK TO HER SO MUCH AS HE DID TO YOU AH THAT WAS ALL LADY LUFTON'S FAULT BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T HAVE HIM PROPERLY LABELLED
5463-39173-0044 OH BY GOD'S MERCY VERY LITTLE AS FOR ME I SHALL GET OVER IT IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS I DON'T DOUBT THAT'S IF I CAN GET ASS'S MILK AND CHANGE OF AIR WE'LL TAKE YOU TO BARCHESTER FOR THAT BUT AS I WAS SAYING I REALLY DO THINK LORD LUFTON LIKES GRISELDA GRANTLY
5463-39173-0045 THEN I REALLY DO THINK THAT HE HAS UNCOMMON BAD TASTE SAID LUCY WITH A REALITY IN HER VOICE DIFFERING MUCH FROM THE TONE OF BANTER SHE HAD HITHERTO USED WHAT LUCY SAID HER SISTER IN LAW LOOKING AT HER
5463-39173-0046 THERE IS I BELIEVE NOTHING IN HER MENTALLY WHATEVER MAY BE HER MORAL EXCELLENCES TO ME SHE IS MORE ABSOLUTELY LIKE A STATUE THAN ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING I EVER SAW TO SIT STILL AND BE ADMIRED IS ALL THAT SHE DESIRES AND IF SHE CANNOT GET THAT
5463-39173-0047 TO SIT STILL AND NOT BE ADMIRED WOULD ALMOST SUFFICE FOR HER I DO NOT WORSHIP LADY LUFTON AS YOU DO BUT I THINK QUITE WELL ENOUGH OF HER TO WONDER THAT SHE SHOULD CHOOSE SUCH A GIRL AS THAT FOR HER SON'S WIFE THAT SHE DOES WISH IT I DO NOT DOUBT
5463-39173-0048 BUT I SHALL INDEED BE SURPRISED IF HE WISHES IT ALSO AND THEN AS SHE FINISHED HER SPEECH LUCY AGAIN FLOGGED THE PONY THIS SHE DID IN VEXATION BECAUSE SHE FELT THAT THE TELL TALE BLOOD HAD SUFFUSED HER FACE WHY LUCY
5463-39173-0049 IF HE WERE YOUR BROTHER YOU COULD NOT BE MORE EAGER ABOUT IT NO I COULD NOT HE IS THE ONLY MAN FRIEND WITH WHOM I WAS EVER INTIMATE AND I CANNOT BEAR TO THINK THAT HE SHOULD THROW HIMSELF AWAY IT'S HORRIDLY IMPROPER TO CARE ABOUT SUCH A THING I HAVE NO DOUBT
5463-39173-0050 I SHALL NOT BE SATISFIED IT'S NO USE YOUR LOOKING AT ME FANNY YOU WILL MAKE ME TALK OF IT AND I WON'T TELL A LIE ON THE SUBJECT I DO LIKE LORD LUFTON VERY MUCH AND I DO DISLIKE GRISELDA GRANTLY ALMOST AS MUCH
5463-39173-0051 THEREFORE I SHALL NOT BE SATISFIED IF THEY BECOME MAN AND WIFE HOWEVER
5463-39173-0052 THERE WAS THEN NOTHING MORE SAID ON THE SUBJECT AND IN TWO MINUTES THEY ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE OF THE HOGGLESTOCK CLERGYMAN MISSUS CRAWLEY HAD BROUGHT TWO CHILDREN WITH HER WHEN SHE CAME FROM THE CORNISH CURACY TO HOGGLESTOCK AND TWO OTHER BABIES HAD BEEN ADDED TO HER CARES SINCE THEN
5463-39173-0053 ONE OF THESE WAS NOW ILL WITH CROUP AND IT WAS WITH THE OBJECT OF OFFERING TO THE MOTHER SOME COMFORT AND SOLACE THAT THE PRESENT VISIT WAS MADE THE TWO LADIES GOT DOWN FROM THEIR CARRIAGE HAVING OBTAINED THE SERVICES OF A BOY TO HOLD PUCK AND SOON FOUND THEMSELVES IN MISSUS CRAWLEY'S SINGLE SITTING ROOM
5463-39173-0054 WHICH THEY KNEW IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO INTRODUCE IN MISTER CRAWLEY'S PRESENCE SHE AS WE HAVE SAID WAS NOT QUITE SO GAUNT NOT ALTOGETHER SO HAGGARD AS IN THE LATTER OF THOSE DREADFUL CORNISH DAYS LADY LUFTON AND MISSUS ARABIN BETWEEN THEM
5463-39173-0055 AND THE SCANTY COMFORT OF THEIR IMPROVED THOUGH STILL WRETCHED INCOME HAD DONE SOMETHING TOWARDS BRINGING HER BACK TO THE WORLD IN WHICH SHE HAD LIVED IN THE SOFT DAYS OF HER CHILDHOOD BUT EVEN THE LIBERAL STIPEND OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR
5463-39173-0056 LIBERAL ACCORDING TO THE SCALE BY WHICH THE INCOMES OF CLERGYMEN IN SOME OF OUR NEW DISTRICTS ARE NOW APPORTIONED WOULD NOT ADMIT OF A GENTLEMAN WITH HIS WIFE AND FOUR CHILDREN LIVING WITH THE ORDINARY COMFORTS OF AN ARTISAN'S FAMILY
5463-39173-0057 AS REGARDS THE MERE EATING AND DRINKING THE AMOUNTS OF BUTCHER'S MEAT AND TEA AND BUTTER THEY OF COURSE WERE USED IN QUANTITIES WHICH ANY ARTISAN WOULD HAVE REGARDED AS COMPATIBLE ONLY WITH DEMI STARVATION BETTER CLOTHING FOR HER CHILDREN WAS NECESSARY AND BETTER CLOTHING FOR HIM
5463-39173-0058 AS FOR HER OWN RAIMENT THE WIVES OF FEW ARTISANS WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTENT TO PUT UP WITH MISSUS CRAWLEY'S BEST GOWN THE STUFF OF WHICH IT WAS MADE HAD BEEN PAID FOR BY HER MOTHER WHEN SHE WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY BESTOWED UPON HER DAUGHTER HER MODEST WEDDING TROUSSEAU
5463-39173-0059 LUCY HAD NEVER SEEN MISSUS CRAWLEY THESE VISITS TO HOGGLESTOCK WERE NOT FREQUENT AND HAD GENERALLY BEEN MADE BY LADY LUFTON AND MISSUS ROBARTS TOGETHER
5463-39173-0060 ALMOST AS PENNILESS AS THE CURATE HIMSELF THEN THEY WOULD WALK TOGETHER FOR HOURS ALONG THE ROCK BOUND SHORE LISTENING TO THE WAVES DISCUSSING DEEP POLEMICAL MYSTERIES SOMETIMES WITH HOT FURY THEN AGAIN WITH TENDER LOVING CHARITY
5463-39173-0061 BUT ALWAYS WITH A MUTUAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF EACH OTHER'S TRUTH NOW THEY LIVED COMPARATIVELY NEAR TOGETHER BUT NO OPPORTUNITIES AROSE FOR SUCH DISCUSSIONS AT ANY RATE ONCE A QUARTER MISTER CRAWLEY WAS PRESSED BY HIS OLD FRIEND TO VISIT HIM AT THE DEANERY
5463-39173-0062 AND DOCTOR ARABIN HAD PROMISED THAT NO ONE ELSE SHOULD BE IN THE HOUSE IF MISTER CRAWLEY OBJECTED TO SOCIETY BUT THIS WAS NOT WHAT HE WANTED THE FINERY AND GRANDEUR OF THE DEANERY AND THE COMFORT OF THAT WARM SNUG LIBRARY WOULD SILENCE HIM AT ONCE
5463-39173-0063 THEN OLD DAYS WOULD HAVE COME BACK TO THEM BUT NOW ARABIN ALWAYS RIDES ON A SLEEK FINE HORSE NOW A DAYS HE ONCE SAID TO HIS WIFE WITH A SNEER
5463-39174-0000 AT THE END OF THE LAST CHAPTER WE LEFT LUCY ROBARTS WAITING FOR AN INTRODUCTION TO MISSUS CRAWLEY WHO WAS SITTING WITH ONE BABY IN HER LAP WHILE SHE WAS ROCKING ANOTHER WHO LAY IN A CRADLE AT HER FEET MISTER CRAWLEY IN THE MEANWHILE HAD RISEN FROM HIS SEAT WITH HIS FINGER BETWEEN THE LEAVES OF AN OLD GRAMMAR
5463-39174-0001 FOR SHE HAD WORK OF THIS KIND OF HER OWN AT HOME WHICH SHE BY NO MEANS NEGLECTED THOUGH THE ATTENDANCE OF NURSES WAS MORE PLENTIFUL WITH HER THAN AT HOGGLESTOCK MISSUS CRAWLEY DID GET UP AND TOLD LUCY THAT SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE HER AND MISTER CRAWLEY CAME FORWARD GRAMMAR IN HAND LOOKING HUMBLE AND MEEK
5463-39174-0002 THE REALITIES OF LIFE HAD BECOME SO STERN TO HER THAT THE OUTWARD ASPECTS OF THEM WERE AS NOTHING SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED A NEW GOWN BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN USEFUL BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING TO HER IF ALL THE COUNTY KNEW THAT THE ONE IN WHICH SHE WENT TO CHURCH HAD BEEN TURNED THREE TIMES
5463-39174-0003 IT GALLED HIM HOWEVER TO THINK THAT HE AND HIS WERE SO POORLY DRESSED I AM AFRAID YOU CAN HARDLY FIND A CHAIR MISS ROBARTS SAID MISTER CRAWLEY
5463-39174-0004 MOVING A PILE OF RAGGED COVERLESS BOOKS ON TO THE TABLE I HOPE HE'LL FORGIVE ME FOR MOVING THEM THEY ARE NOT BOB'S AT LEAST NOT THE MOST OF THEM BUT MINE SAID THE GIRL BUT SOME OF THEM ARE MINE SAID THE BOY AIN'T THEY GRACE
5463-39174-0005 AND ARE YOU A GREAT SCHOLAR ASKED LUCY DRAWING THE CHILD TO HER I DON'T KNOW SAID GRACE WITH A SHEEPISH FACE I AM IN GREEK DELECTUS AND THE IRREGULAR VERBS GREEK DELECTUS AND THE IRREGULAR VERBS AND LUCY PUT UP HER HANDS WITH ASTONISHMENT
5463-39174-0006 AND SHE KNOWS AN ODE OF HORACE ALL BY HEART SAID BOB AN ODE OF HORACE SAID LUCY STILL HOLDING THE YOUNG SHAMEFACED FEMALE PRODIGY CLOSE TO HER KNEES IT IS ALL THAT I CAN GIVE THEM SAID MISTER CRAWLEY APOLOGETICALLY
5463-39174-0007 A LITTLE SCHOLARSHIP IS THE ONLY FORTUNE THAT HAS COME IN MY WAY AND I ENDEAVOUR TO SHARE THAT WITH MY CHILDREN I BELIEVE MEN SAY THAT IT IS THE BEST FORTUNE ANY OF US CAN HAVE SAID LUCY THINKING HOWEVER IN HER OWN MIND
5463-39174-0008 THAT HORACE AND THE IRREGULAR GREEK VERBS SAVOURED TOO MUCH OF PRECOCIOUS FORCING IN A YOUNG LADY OF NINE YEARS OLD BUT NEVERTHELESS GRACE WAS A PRETTY SIMPLE LOOKING GIRL AND CLUNG TO HER ALLY CLOSELY AND SEEMED TO LIKE BEING FONDLED
5463-39174-0009 SO THAT LUCY ANXIOUSLY WISHED THAT MISTER CRAWLEY COULD BE GOT RID OF AND THE PRESENTS PRODUCED I HOPE YOU HAVE LEFT MISTER ROBARTS QUITE WELL SAID MISTER CRAWLEY WITH A STIFF CEREMONIAL VOICE
5463-39174-0010 YES I HAVE HEARD OF IT SAID MISTER CRAWLEY GRAVELY I HOPE THAT HIS PROMOTION MAY TEND IN EVERY WAY TO HIS ADVANTAGE HERE AND HEREAFTER IT SEEMED HOWEVER TO BE MANIFEST FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH HE EXPRESSED HIS KIND WISHES
5463-39174-0011 THAT HIS HOPES AND EXPECTATIONS DID NOT GO HAND IN HAND TOGETHER BY THE BY HE DESIRED US TO SAY THAT HE WILL CALL HERE TO MORROW AT ABOUT ELEVEN DIDN'T HE SAY FANNY YES
5463-39174-0012 LOOKING UP FOR A MOMENT FROM THE ANXIOUS DISCUSSION IN WHICH SHE WAS ALREADY ENGAGED WITH MISSUS CRAWLEY ON NURSERY MATTERS PRAY TELL HIM SAID MISTER CRAWLEY THAT I SHALL BE HAPPY TO SEE HIM
5463-39174-0013 HIS NEW DUTIES DO NOT DISTURB HIM MUCH AS YET SAID LUCY AND HIS RIDING OVER HERE WILL BE NO TROUBLE TO HIM YES THERE HE HAS THE ADVANTAGE OVER ME I UNFORTUNATELY HAVE NO HORSE
5463-39174-0014 AND THEN LUCY BEGAN PETTING THE LITTLE BOY AND BY DEGREES SLIPPED A SMALL BAG OF GINGERBREAD NUTS OUT OF HER MUFF INTO HIS HANDS SHE HAD NOT THE PATIENCE NECESSARY FOR WAITING AS HAD HER SISTER IN LAW THE BOY TOOK THE BAG PEEPED INTO IT AND THEN LOOKED UP INTO HER FACE
5463-39174-0015 WHAT IS THAT BOB SAID MISTER CRAWLEY GINGERBREAD FALTERED BOBBY FEELING THAT A SIN HAD BEEN COMMITTED THOUGH PROBABLY FEELING ALSO THAT HE HIMSELF COULD HARDLY AS YET BE ACCOUNTED AS DEEPLY GUILTY MISS ROBARTS SAID THE FATHER WE ARE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU
5463-39174-0016 BUT OUR CHILDREN ARE HARDLY USED TO SUCH THINGS
5463-39174-0017 OH CERTAINLY BOB MY CHILD
5463-39174-0018 AND THEN THE BAG IN A SOLEMN MANNER WAS CARRIED OVER TO THEIR MOTHER WHO TAKING IT FROM HER SON'S HANDS LAID IT HIGH ON A BOOKSHELF AND NOT ONE NOW SAID LUCY ROBARTS VERY PITEOUSLY DON'T BE SO HARD MISTER CRAWLEY NOT UPON THEM BUT UPON ME
5463-39174-0019 THIS WAS VERY DISCOURAGING TO LUCY IF ONE SMALL BAG OF GINGERBREAD NUTS CREATED SO GREAT A DIFFICULTY HOW WAS SHE TO DISPOSE OF THE POT OF GUAVA JELLY AND BOX OF BONBONS WHICH WERE STILL IN HER MUFF OR HOW DISTRIBUTE THE PACKET OF ORANGES WITH WHICH THE PONY CARRIAGE WAS LADEN
5463-39174-0020 AND THERE WAS JELLY FOR THE SICK CHILD AND CHICKEN BROTH WHICH WAS INDEED ANOTHER JELLY AND TO TELL THE TRUTH OPENLY THERE WAS ALSO A JOINT OF FRESH PORK AND A BASKET OF EGGS FROM THE FRAMLEY PARSONAGE FARMYARD WHICH MISSUS ROBARTS WAS TO INTRODUCE SHOULD SHE FIND HERSELF CAPABLE OF DOING SO
5463-39174-0021 BUT WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY BE CAST OUT WITH UTTER SCORN BY MISTER CRAWLEY IF TENDERED IN HIS IMMEDIATE PRESENCE THERE HAD ALSO BEEN A SUGGESTION AS TO ADDING TWO OR THREE BOTTLES OF PORT BUT THE COURAGE OF THE LADIES HAD FAILED THEM ON THAT HEAD AND THE WINE WAS NOT NOW ADDED TO THEIR DIFFICULTIES
5463-39174-0022 LUCY FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO KEEP UP A CONVERSATION WITH MISTER CRAWLEY THE MORE SO AS MISSUS ROBARTS AND MISSUS CRAWLEY PRESENTLY WITHDREW INTO A BEDROOM TAKING THE TWO YOUNGER CHILDREN WITH THEM HOW UNLUCKY THOUGHT LUCY THAT SHE HAS NOT GOT MY MUFF WITH HER
5463-39174-0023 BUT THE MUFF LAY IN HER LAP PONDEROUS WITH ITS RICH ENCLOSURES I SUPPOSE YOU WILL LIVE IN BARCHESTER FOR A PORTION OF THE YEAR NOW SAID MISTER CRAWLEY I REALLY DO NOT KNOW AS YET MARK TALKS OF TAKING LODGINGS FOR HIS FIRST MONTH'S RESIDENCE
5463-39174-0024 MARK THINKS THAT AS HE IS SO NEAR HE NEED NOT BE MUCH ABSENT FROM FRAMLEY EVEN DURING HIS RESIDENCE AND THEN LADY LUFTON IS SO GOOD ABOUT THE SCHOOLS AH YES BUT LADY LUFTON IS NOT A CLERGYMAN MISS ROBARTS
5463-39174-0025 IT WAS ON LUCY'S TONGUE TO SAY THAT HER LADYSHIP WAS PRETTY NEARLY AS BAD BUT SHE STOPPED HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT PROVIDENCE SENT GREAT RELIEF TO MISS ROBARTS IN THE SHAPE OF MISSUS CRAWLEY'S RED ARMED MAID OF ALL WORK WHO WALKING UP TO HER MASTER
5463-39174-0026 WHISPERED INTO HIS EAR THAT HE WAS WANTED IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY AT WHICH HIS ATTENDANCE WAS ALWAYS REQUIRED IN HIS PARISH SCHOOL AND THAT ATTENDANCE BEING SO PUNCTUALLY GIVEN THOSE WHO WANTED HIM LOOKED FOR HIM THERE AT THIS HOUR AND IF HE WERE ABSENT DID NOT SCRUPLE TO SEND FOR HIM
5463-39174-0027 MISS ROBARTS I AM AFRAID YOU MUST EXCUSE ME SAID HE GETTING UP AND TAKING HIS HAT AND STICK LUCY BEGGED THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BE AT ALL IN THE WAY AND ALREADY BEGAN TO SPECULATE HOW SHE MIGHT BEST UNLOAD HER TREASURES
5463-39174-0028 AND THEN STICK IN HAND HE WALKED FORTH AND LUCY FANCIED THAT BOBBY'S EYES IMMEDIATELY RESTED ON THE BAG OF GINGERBREAD NUTS BOB SAID SHE ALMOST IN A WHISPER
5463-39174-0029 I HAVE LEFT A BOOK BEHIND ME HE SAID AND COMING BACK THROUGH THE ROOM HE TOOK UP THE WELL WORN PRAYER BOOK WHICH ACCOMPANIED HIM IN ALL HIS WANDERINGS THROUGH THE PARISH BOBBY WHEN HE SAW HIS FATHER HAD RETREATED A FEW STEPS BACK AS ALSO DID GRACE WHO TO CONFESS THE TRUTH
5463-39174-0030 HAD BEEN ATTRACTED BY THE SOUND OF SUGAR PLUMS IN SPITE OF THE IRREGULAR VERBS AND LUCY WITHDREW HER HAND FROM HER MUFF AND LOOKED GUILTY WAS SHE NOT DECEIVING THE GOOD MAN NAY TEACHING HIS OWN CHILDREN TO DECEIVE HIM
5463-39174-0031 BUT THERE ARE MEN MADE OF SUCH STUFF THAT AN ANGEL COULD HARDLY LIVE WITH THEM WITHOUT SOME DECEIT PAPA'S GONE NOW WHISPERED BOBBY I SAW HIM TURN ROUND THE CORNER HE AT ANY RATE HAD LEARNED HIS LESSON AS IT WAS NATURAL THAT HE SHOULD DO
5463-39174-0032 SOME ONE ELSE ALSO HAD LEARNED THAT PAPA WAS GONE FOR WHILE BOB AND GRACE WERE STILL COUNTING THE BIG LUMPS OF SUGAR CANDY EACH EMPLOYED THE WHILE FOR INWARD SOLACE WITH AN INCH OF BARLEY SUGAR THE FRONT DOOR OPENED AND A BIG BASKET AND A BUNDLE DONE UP IN A KITCHEN CLOTH
5463-39174-0033 I DID VENTURE TO BRING THEM SAID FANNY WITH A LOOK OF SHAME FOR I KNOW HOW A SICK CHILD OCCUPIES THE WHOLE HOUSE AH MY FRIEND SAID MISSUS CRAWLEY TAKING HOLD OF MISSUS ROBARTS ARM AND LOOKING INTO HER FACE THAT SORT OF SHAME IS OVER WITH ME
5463-39174-0034 GOD HAS TRIED US WITH WANT AND FOR MY CHILDREN'S SAKE I AM GLAD OF SUCH RELIEF BUT WILL HE BE ANGRY I WILL MANAGE IT DEAR MISSUS ROBARTS YOU MUST NOT BE SURPRISED AT HIM HIS LOT IS SOMETIMES VERY HARD TO BEAR
5463-39174-0035 SUCH THINGS ARE SO MUCH WORSE FOR A MAN THAN FOR A WOMAN FANNY WAS NOT QUITE PREPARED TO ADMIT THIS IN HER OWN HEART BUT SHE MADE NO REPLY ON THAT HEAD I AM SURE I HOPE WE MAY BE ABLE TO BE OF USE TO YOU SHE SAID IF YOU WILL ONLY LOOK UPON ME AS AN OLD FRIEND AND WRITE TO ME IF YOU WANT ME
5463-39174-0036 TO FEEL HERSELF SO DIFFERENT FROM THE WIVES OF OTHER CLERGYMEN AROUND HER TO KNOW THAT THEY LIVED SOFTLY WHILE SHE WITH ALL THE WORK OF HER HANDS AND UNCEASING STRUGGLE OF HER ENERGIES COULD HARDLY MANAGE TO PLACE WHOLESOME FOOD BEFORE HER HUSBAND AND CHILDREN IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING A GRIEVOUS THING TO THINK OF
5463-39174-0037 THAT ALL THE WORK OF HER MIND SHOULD BE GIVEN UP TO SUCH SUBJECTS AS THESE BUT NEVERTHELESS SHE COULD BEAR IT SHE SAID AS LONG AS HE WOULD CARRY HIMSELF LIKE A MAN AND FACE HIS LOT BOLDLY BEFORE THE WORLD AND THEN SHE TOLD HOW HE HAD BEEN BETTER THERE AT HOGGLESTOCK THAN IN THEIR FORMER RESIDENCE DOWN IN CORNWALL
5463-39174-0038 MISSUS ARABIN TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS SO ANXIOUS YOU SHOULD GO TO THEM SAID MISSUS ROBARTS AH YES BUT THAT I FEAR IS IMPOSSIBLE THE CHILDREN YOU KNOW MISSUS ROBARTS
5463-39174-0039 OH NO I COULD NOT PUNISH YOU FOR YOUR GOODNESS IN THAT WAY BUT HE WOULD NOT GO HE COULD GO AND LEAVE ME AT HOME SOMETIMES I HAVE THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE SO AND I HAVE DONE ALL IN MY POWER TO PERSUADE HIM I HAVE TOLD HIM THAT IF HE COULD MIX ONCE MORE WITH THE WORLD WITH THE CLERICAL WORLD YOU KNOW
5463-39174-0040 THAT HE WOULD BE BETTER FITTED FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS OWN DUTIES BUT HE ANSWERS ME ANGRILY THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT HIS COAT IS NOT FIT FOR THE DEAN'S TABLE AND MISSUS CRAWLEY ALMOST BLUSHED AS SHE SPOKE OF SUCH A REASON WHAT WITH AN OLD FRIEND LIKE DOCTOR ARABIN
5463-39174-0041 BUT WHAT CAN I DO I FEAR THAT HE REGARDS THE RICH AS HIS ENEMIES HE IS PINING FOR THE SOLACE OF SOME FRIEND TO WHOM HE COULD TALK FOR SOME EQUAL WITH A MIND EDUCATED LIKE HIS OWN TO WHOSE THOUGHTS HE COULD LISTEN AND TO WHOM HE COULD SPEAK HIS OWN THOUGHTS
5463-39174-0042 BUT SUCH A FRIEND MUST BE EQUAL NOT ONLY IN MIND BUT IN PURSE AND WHERE CAN HE EVER FIND SUCH A MAN AS THAT BUT YOU MAY GET BETTER PREFERMENT AH NO AND IF HE DID WE ARE HARDLY FIT FOR IT NOW IF I COULD THINK THAT I COULD EDUCATE MY CHILDREN
5463-39174-0043 IF I COULD ONLY DO SOMETHING FOR MY POOR GRACE IN ANSWER TO THIS MISSUS ROBARTS SAID A WORD OR TWO BUT NOT MUCH SHE RESOLVED HOWEVER THAT IF SHE COULD GET HER HUSBAND'S LEAVE SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE FOR GRACE
5463-39174-0044 AND WAS IT NOT INCUMBENT ON HER TO MAKE SOME KINDLY USE OF ALL THE GOODS WITH WHICH PROVIDENCE HAD BLESSED HERSELF AND THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THE SITTING ROOM EACH AGAIN WITH A YOUNG CHILD IN HER ARMS
5463-39174-0045 LUCY HAD BEEN ENGAGED THE WHILE WITH THE CHILDREN AND WHEN THE TWO MARRIED LADIES ENTERED THEY FOUND THAT A SHOP HAD BEEN OPENED AT WHICH ALL MANNER OF LUXURIES WERE BEING READILY SOLD AND PURCHASED AT MARVELLOUSLY EASY PRICES THE GUAVA JELLY WAS THERE AND THE ORANGES AND THE SUGAR PLUMS RED AND YELLOW AND STRIPED
5463-39174-0046 AND MOREOVER THE GINGERBREAD HAD BEEN TAKEN DOWN IN THE AUDACITY OF THEIR COMMERCIAL SPECULATIONS AND THE NUTS WERE SPREAD OUT UPON A BOARD BEHIND WHICH LUCY STOOD AS SHOP GIRL DISPOSING OF THEM FOR KISSES MAMMA MAMMA SAID BOBBY RUNNING UP TO HIS MOTHER YOU MUST BUY SOMETHING OF HER
5463-39174-0047 AND HE POINTED WITH HIS FINGERS AT THE SHOP GIRL YOU MUST GIVE HER TWO KISSES FOR THAT HEAP OF BARLEY SUGAR LOOKING AT BOBBY'S MOUTH AT THE TIME ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT HIS KISSES MIGHT BE DISPENSED WITH WHEN THEY WERE AGAIN IN THE PONY CARRIAGE BEHIND THE IMPATIENT PUCK AND WERE WELL AWAY FROM THE DOOR
5463-39174-0048 FANNY WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK HOW VERY DIFFERENT THOSE TWO ARE SHE SAID DIFFERENT IN THEIR MINDS AND IN THEIR SPIRIT BUT HOW MUCH HIGHER TONED IS HER MIND THAN HIS HOW WEAK HE IS IN MANY THINGS AND HOW STRONG SHE IS IN EVERYTHING
5463-39174-0049 HOW FALSE IS HIS PRIDE AND HOW FALSE HIS SHAME BUT WE MUST REMEMBER WHAT HE HAS TO BEAR IT IS NOT EVERY ONE THAT CAN ENDURE SUCH A LIFE AS HIS WITHOUT FALSE PRIDE AND FALSE SHAME BUT SHE HAS NEITHER SAID LUCY
5463-39174-0050 BECAUSE YOU HAVE ONE HERO IN A FAMILY DOES THAT GIVE YOU A RIGHT TO EXPECT ANOTHER SAID MISSUS ROBARTS OF ALL MY OWN ACQUAINTANCE MISSUS CRAWLEY I THINK COMES NEAREST TO HEROISM AND THEN THEY PASSED BY THE HOGGLESTOCK SCHOOL AND MISTER CRAWLEY WHEN HE HEARD THE NOISE OF THE WHEELS CAME OUT
5514-19192-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE DISORDER A PARTISAN OF ORDER
5514-19192-0001 HE DID NOT ANSWER MY QUESTION HE IS A MAN WHO DOES GOOD BY GUN SHOTS SAID COMBEFERRE THOSE WHO HAVE PRESERVED SOME MEMORY OF THIS ALREADY DISTANT EPOCH KNOW THAT THE NATIONAL GUARD FROM THE SUBURBS WAS VALIANT AGAINST INSURRECTIONS
5514-19192-0002 IT WAS PARTICULARLY ZEALOUS AND INTREPID IN THE DAYS OF JUNE EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO
5514-19192-0003 WHOSE ESTABLISHMENT HAD BEEN CLOSED BY THE RIOTS BECAME LEONINE AT THE SIGHT OF HIS DESERTED DANCE HALL AND GOT HIMSELF KILLED TO PRESERVE THE ORDER REPRESENTED BY A TEA GARDEN IN THAT BOURGEOIS AND HEROIC TIME
5514-19192-0004 IN THE PRESENCE OF IDEAS WHICH HAD THEIR KNIGHTS INTERESTS HAD THEIR PALADINS THE PROSINESS OF THE ORIGINATORS DETRACTED NOTHING FROM THE BRAVERY OF THE MOVEMENT THE DIMINUTION OF A PILE OF CROWNS MADE BANKERS SING THE MARSEILLAISE
5514-19192-0005 THEY SHED THEIR BLOOD LYRICALLY FOR THE COUNTING HOUSE AND THEY DEFENDED THE SHOP THAT IMMENSE DIMINUTIVE OF THE FATHERLAND WITH LACEDAEMONIAN ENTHUSIASM AT BOTTOM WE WILL OBSERVE THERE WAS NOTHING IN ALL THIS THAT WAS NOT EXTREMELY SERIOUS
5514-19192-0006 IT WAS SOCIAL ELEMENTS ENTERING INTO STRIFE WHILE AWAITING THE DAY WHEN THEY SHOULD ENTER INTO EQUILIBRIUM ANOTHER SIGN OF THE TIMES WAS THE ANARCHY MINGLED WITH GOVERNMENTALISM THE BARBAROUS NAME OF THE CORRECT PARTY
5514-19192-0007 THE DRUM SUDDENLY BEAT CAPRICIOUS CALLS AT THE COMMAND OF SUCH OR SUCH A COLONEL OF THE NATIONAL GUARD
5514-19192-0008 SUCH AND SUCH NATIONAL GUARDSMEN FOUGHT FOR AN IDEA AND ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT AT CRITICAL MOMENTS ON DAYS THEY TOOK COUNSEL LESS OF THEIR LEADERS THAN OF THEIR INSTINCTS
5514-19192-0009 SOME OF THE SWORD LIKE FANNICOT OTHERS OF THE PEN LIKE HENRI FONFREDE CIVILIZATION UNFORTUNATELY REPRESENTED AT THIS EPOCH RATHER BY AN AGGREGATION OF INTERESTS THAN BY A GROUP OF PRINCIPLES WAS OR THOUGHT ITSELF IN PERIL
5514-19192-0010 IT SET UP THE CRY OF ALARM EACH CONSTITUTING HIMSELF A CENTRE DEFENDED IT SUCCORED IT AND PROTECTED IT WITH HIS OWN HEAD AND THE FIRST COMER TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO SAVE SOCIETY ZEAL SOMETIMES PROCEEDED TO EXTERMINATION
5514-19192-0011 A PLATOON OF THE NATIONAL GUARD WOULD CONSTITUTE ITSELF ON ITS OWN AUTHORITY A PRIVATE COUNCIL OF WAR AND JUDGE AND EXECUTE A CAPTURED INSURGENT IN FIVE MINUTES IT WAS AN IMPROVISATION OF THIS SORT THAT HAD SLAIN JEAN PROUVAIRE FIERCE LYNCH LAW
5514-19192-0012 WITH WHICH NO ONE PARTY HAD ANY RIGHT TO REPROACH THE REST FOR IT HAS BEEN APPLIED BY THE REPUBLIC IN AMERICA AS WELL AS BY THE MONARCHY IN EUROPE THIS LYNCH LAW WAS COMPLICATED WITH MISTAKES ON ONE DAY OF RIOTING A YOUNG POET NAMED PAUL AIME GARNIER
5514-19192-0013 WAS PURSUED IN THE PLACE ROYALE WITH A BAYONET AT HIS LOINS
5514-19192-0014 THEY SHOUTED THERE'S ANOTHER OF THOSE SAINT SIMONIANS AND THEY WANTED TO KILL HIM NOW HE HAD UNDER HIS ARM A VOLUME OF THE MEMOIRS OF THE DUC DE SAINT SIMON
5514-19192-0015 AND HAD SHOUTED DEATH ON THE SIXTH OF JUNE EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO A COMPANY OF THE NATIONAL GUARDS FROM THE SUBURBS COMMANDED BY THE CAPTAIN FANNICOT ABOVE MENTIONED
5514-19192-0016 OUT OF CAPRICE AND ITS OWN GOOD PLEASURE THIS FACT SINGULAR THOUGH IT MAY SEEM WAS PROVED AT THE JUDICIAL INVESTIGATION OPENED IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE INSURRECTION OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO CAPTAIN FANNICOT A BOLD AND IMPATIENT BOURGEOIS
5514-19192-0017 A SORT OF CONDOTTIERE OF THE ORDER OF THOSE WHOM WE HAVE JUST CHARACTERIZED A FANATICAL AND INTRACTABLE GOVERNMENTALIST COULD NOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO FIRE PREMATURELY
5514-19192-0018 AND THE AMBITION OF CAPTURING THE BARRICADE ALONE AND UNAIDED THAT IS TO SAY WITH HIS COMPANY EXASPERATED BY THE SUCCESSIVE APPARITION OF THE RED FLAG AND THE OLD COAT WHICH HE TOOK FOR THE BLACK FLAG HE LOUDLY BLAMED THE GENERALS AND CHIEFS OF THE CORPS
5514-19192-0019 AND WHO WERE ALLOWING THE INSURRECTION TO FRY IN ITS OWN FAT TO USE THE CELEBRATED EXPRESSION OF ONE OF THEM FOR HIS PART HE THOUGHT THE BARRICADE RIPE AND AS THAT WHICH IS RIPE OUGHT TO FALL HE MADE THE ATTEMPT
5514-19192-0020 HE COMMANDED MEN AS RESOLUTE AS HIMSELF RAGING FELLOWS AS A WITNESS SAID HIS COMPANY THE SAME WHICH HAD SHOT JEAN PROUVAIRE THE POET WAS THE FIRST OF THE BATTALION POSTED AT THE ANGLE OF THE STREET
5514-19192-0021 THIS MOVEMENT EXECUTED WITH MORE GOOD WILL THAN STRATEGY COST THE FANNICOT COMPANY DEAR BEFORE IT HAD TRAVERSED TWO THIRDS OF THE STREET IT WAS RECEIVED BY A GENERAL DISCHARGE FROM THE BARRICADE FOUR THE MOST AUDACIOUS WHO WERE RUNNING ON IN FRONT
5514-19192-0022 WERE MOWN DOWN POINT BLANK AT THE VERY FOOT OF THE REDOUBT AND THIS COURAGEOUS THRONG OF NATIONAL GUARDS VERY BRAVE MEN BUT LACKING IN MILITARY TENACITY WERE FORCED TO FALL BACK AFTER SOME HESITATION LEAVING FIFTEEN CORPSES ON THE PAVEMENT
5514-19192-0023 THIS MOMENTARY HESITATION GAVE THE INSURGENTS TIME TO RE LOAD THEIR WEAPONS AND A SECOND AND VERY DESTRUCTIVE DISCHARGE STRUCK THE COMPANY BEFORE IT COULD REGAIN THE CORNER OF THE STREET ITS SHELTER A MOMENT MORE AND IT WAS CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO FIRES
5514-19192-0024 AND IT RECEIVED THE VOLLEY FROM THE BATTERY PIECE WHICH NOT HAVING RECEIVED THE ORDER HAD NOT DISCONTINUED ITS FIRING THE INTREPID AND IMPRUDENT FANNICOT WAS ONE OF THE DEAD FROM THIS GRAPE SHOT HE WAS KILLED BY THE CANNON THAT IS TO SAY BY ORDER
5514-19192-0025 THIS ATTACK WHICH WAS MORE FURIOUS THAN SERIOUS
5514-19192-0026 THEY ARE GETTING THEIR OWN MEN KILLED AND THEY ARE USING UP OUR AMMUNITION FOR NOTHING
5514-19192-0027 INSURRECTION AND REPRESSION DO NOT FIGHT WITH EQUAL WEAPONS INSURRECTION WHICH IS SPEEDILY EXHAUSTED HAS ONLY A CERTAIN NUMBER OF SHOTS TO FIRE AND A CERTAIN NUMBER OF COMBATANTS TO EXPEND AN EMPTY CARTRIDGE BOX A MAN KILLED CANNOT BE REPLACED
5514-19192-0028 AS REPRESSION HAS THE ARMY IT DOES NOT COUNT ITS MEN AND AS IT HAS VINCENNES IT DOES NOT COUNT ITS SHOTS REPRESSION HAS AS MANY REGIMENTS AS THE BARRICADE HAS MEN AND AS MANY ARSENALS AS THE BARRICADE HAS CARTRIDGE BOXES
5514-19192-0029 THUS THEY ARE STRUGGLES OF ONE AGAINST A HUNDRED WHICH ALWAYS END IN CRUSHING THE BARRICADE UNLESS THE REVOLUTION UPRISING SUDDENLY FLINGS INTO THE BALANCE ITS FLAMING ARCHANGEL'S SWORD THIS DOES HAPPEN SOMETIMES
5514-19192-0030 THEN EVERYTHING RISES THE PAVEMENTS BEGIN TO SEETHE POPULAR REDOUBTS ABOUND PARIS QUIVERS SUPREMELY THE QUID DIVINUM IS GIVEN FORTH A TENTH OF AUGUST IS IN THE AIR A TWENTY NINTH OF JULY IS IN THE AIR
5514-19192-0031 A WONDERFUL LIGHT APPEARS THE YAWNING MAW OF FORCE DRAWS BACK AND THE ARMY THAT LION SEES BEFORE IT ERECT AND TRANQUIL THAT PROPHET FRANCE CHAPTER THIRTEEN
5514-19192-0032 PASSING GLEAMS IN THE CHAOS OF SENTIMENTS AND PASSIONS WHICH DEFEND A BARRICADE THERE IS A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING THERE IS BRAVERY THERE IS YOUTH HONOR ENTHUSIASM THE IDEAL CONVICTION
5514-19192-0033 THE RAGE OF THE GAMBLER AND ABOVE ALL INTERMITTENCES OF HOPE ONE OF THESE INTERMITTENCES ONE OF THESE VAGUE QUIVERS OF HOPE SUDDENLY TRAVERSED THE BARRICADE OF THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT WAS LEAST EXPECTED LISTEN
5514-19192-0034 WHO WAS STILL ON THE WATCH IT SEEMS TO ME THAT PARIS IS WAKING UP IT IS CERTAIN THAT ON THE MORNING OF THE SIXTH OF JUNE THE INSURRECTION BROKE OUT AFRESH FOR AN HOUR OR TWO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT
5514-19192-0035 REANIMATED SOME FANCIES BARRICADES WERE BEGUN IN THE RUE DU POIRIER AND THE RUE DES GRAVILLIERS IN FRONT OF THE PORTE SAINT MARTIN A YOUNG MAN ARMED WITH A RIFLE ATTACKED ALONE A SQUADRON OF CAVALRY
5514-19192-0036 IN PLAIN SIGHT ON THE OPEN BOULEVARD HE PLACED ONE KNEE ON THE GROUND SHOULDERED HIS WEAPON FIRED KILLED THE COMMANDER OF THE SQUADRON AND TURNED AWAY SAYING THERE'S ANOTHER WHO WILL DO US NO MORE HARM HE WAS PUT TO THE SWORD
5514-19192-0037 THE SLATS OF THE BLIND COULD BE SEEN TO TREMBLE AT EVERY SHOT A CHILD FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE WAS ARRESTED IN THE RUE DE LA COSSONERIE WITH HIS POCKETS FULL OF CARTRIDGES MANY POSTS WERE ATTACKED AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE RUE BERTIN POIREE
5514-19192-0038 A VERY LIVELY AND UTTERLY UNEXPECTED FUSILLADE WELCOMED A REGIMENT OF CUIRRASSIERS AT WHOSE HEAD MARCHED MARSHAL GENERAL CAVAIGNAC DE BARAGUE IN THE RUE PLANCHE MIBRAY THEY THREW OLD PIECES OF POTTERY AND HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS
5514-19192-0039 DOWN ON THE SOLDIERS FROM THE ROOFS A BAD SIGN
5514-19192-0040 AS HE RECALLED SUCHET'S SAYING AT SARAGOSSA
5514-19192-0041 THESE GENERAL SYMPTOMS WHICH PRESENTED THEMSELVES AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE UPRISING HAD BEEN RENDERED LOCAL THIS FEVER OF WRATH THESE SPARKS WHICH FLEW HITHER AND THITHER ABOVE THOSE DEEP MASSES OF
5514-19192-0042 ALL THIS TAKEN TOGETHER DISTURBED THE MILITARY CHIEFS
5514-19192-0043 THEY DELAYED THE ATTACK ON THE BARRICADES MAUBUEE
5514-19192-0044 IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE BARRICADES ONLY AND BE ABLE TO FINISH THEM AT ONE BLOW COLUMNS WERE THROWN INTO THE STREETS WHERE THERE WAS FERMENTATION SWEEPING THE LARGE SOUNDING THE SMALL RIGHT AND LEFT NOW SLOWLY AND CAUTIOUSLY NOW AT FULL CHARGE
5514-19192-0045 THE TROOPS BROKE IN THE DOORS OF HOUSES WHENCE SHOTS HAD BEEN FIRED AT THE SAME TIME
5514-19192-0046 THIS REPRESSION WAS NOT EFFECTED WITHOUT SOME COMMOTION AND WITHOUT THAT TUMULTUOUS UPROAR PECULIAR TO COLLISIONS BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE PEOPLE
5514-19192-0047 MOREOVER HE HAD SEEN WOUNDED MEN PASSING THE END OF THE STREET IN LITTERS AND HE SAID TO COURFEYRAC
5514-19192-0048 THEIR HOPE DID NOT LAST LONG THE GLEAM WAS QUICKLY ECLIPSED IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR WHAT WAS IN THE AIR VANISHED IT WAS A FLASH OF LIGHTNING UNACCOMPANIED BY THUNDER AND THE INSURGENTS FELT THAT SORT OF LEADEN COPE
5514-19192-0049 WHICH THE INDIFFERENCE OF THE PEOPLE CASTS OVER OBSTINATE AND DESERTED MEN FALL OVER THEM ONCE MORE THE GENERAL MOVEMENT WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE ASSUMED A VAGUE OUTLINE HAD MISCARRIED AND THE ATTENTION OF THE MINISTER OF WAR AND THE STRATEGY OF THE GENERALS
5514-19192-0050 COULD NOW BE CONCENTRATED ON THE THREE OR FOUR BARRICADES WHICH STILL REMAINED STANDING THE SUN WAS MOUNTING ABOVE THE HORIZON
5514-19193-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN WHEREIN WILL APPEAR THE NAME OF ENJOLRAS MISTRESS
5514-19193-0001 CONTINUED TO INSULT THE CANNON AND EACH TIME THAT THAT GLOOMY CLOUD OF PROJECTILES WHICH IS CALLED GRAPE SHOT PASSED OVERHEAD WITH ITS TERRIBLE SOUND HE ASSAILED IT WITH A BURST OF IRONY YOU ARE WEARING OUT YOUR LUNGS POOR BRUTAL OLD FELLOW
5514-19193-0002 YOU PAIN ME YOU ARE WASTING YOUR ROW THAT'S NOT THUNDER IT'S A COUGH AND THE BYSTANDERS LAUGHED
5514-19193-0003 WHO MAKE US CRAZY THAT IS TO SAY BRAVE WHEN A MAN IS AS MUCH IN LOVE AS A TIGER
5514-19193-0004 THAT IS ONE WAY OF TAKING OUR REVENGE FOR THE CAPERS THAT MESDAMES OUR GRISETTES PLAY ON US ROLAND GETS HIMSELF KILLED FOR ANGELIQUE ALL OUR HEROISM COMES FROM OUR WOMEN A MAN WITHOUT A WOMAN IS A PISTOL WITHOUT A TRIGGER IT IS THE WOMAN THAT SETS THE MAN OFF
5514-19193-0005 HE IS NOT IN LOVE AND YET HE MANAGES TO BE INTREPID IT IS A THING UNHEARD OF THAT A MAN SHOULD BE AS COLD AS ICE AND AS BOLD AS FIRE
5514-19193-0006 HAD ANY ONE BEEN NEAR HIM THAT PERSON WOULD HAVE HEARD HIM MUTTER IN A LOW VOICE PATRIA
5514-19193-0007 AND ASSUMING THE TONE OF AN USHER MAKING AN ANNOUNCEMENT HE ADDED MY NAME IS EIGHT POUNDER IN FACT A NEW PERSONAGE HAD ENTERED ON THE SCENE THIS WAS A SECOND PIECE OF ORDNANCE
5514-19193-0008 AND PLACED THIS SECOND PIECE IN LINE WITH THE FIRST THIS OUTLINED THE CATASTROPHE A FEW MINUTES LATER THE TWO PIECES RAPIDLY SERVED WERE FIRING POINT BLANK AT THE REDOUBT
5514-19193-0009 THE PLATOON FIRING OF THE LINE AND OF THE SOLDIERS FROM THE SUBURBS SUSTAINED THE ARTILLERY ANOTHER CANNONADE WAS AUDIBLE AT SOME DISTANCE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE TWO GUNS WERE FURIOUSLY ATTACKING THE REDOUBT FROM THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE
5514-19193-0010 THE FOUR CANNONS ECHOED EACH OTHER MOURNFULLY THE BARKING OF THESE SOMBRE DOGS OF WAR REPLIED TO EACH OTHER
5514-19193-0011 THE OTHER BALLS THE PIECE WHICH WAS FIRING BALLS WAS POINTED A LITTLE HIGH AND THE AIM WAS CALCULATED SO THAT THE BALL STRUCK THE EXTREME EDGE OF THE UPPER CREST OF THE BARRICADE AND CRUMBLED THE STONE DOWN UPON THE INSURGENTS MINGLED WITH BURSTS OF GRAPE SHOT
5514-19193-0012 THE OBJECT OF THIS MODE OF FIRING WAS TO DRIVE THE INSURGENTS FROM THE SUMMIT OF THE REDOUBT AND TO COMPEL THEM TO GATHER CLOSE IN THE INTERIOR THAT IS TO SAY THIS ANNOUNCED THE ASSAULT THE COMBATANTS ONCE DRIVEN FROM THE CREST OF THE BARRICADE BY BALLS AND
5514-19193-0013 FROM THE WINDOWS OF THE CABARET BY GRAPE SHOT THE ATTACKING COLUMNS COULD VENTURE INTO THE STREET WITHOUT BEING PICKED OFF PERHAPS EVEN WITHOUT BEING SEEN COULD BRISKLY AND SUDDENLY SCALE THE REDOUBT
5514-19193-0014 AND HE SHOUTED FIRE ON THE ARTILLERY MEN ALL WERE READY THE BARRICADE WHICH HAD LONG BEEN SILENT POURED FORTH A DESPERATE FIRE SEVEN OR EIGHT DISCHARGES FOLLOWED WITH A SORT OF RAGE AND JOY
5514-19193-0015 THE STREET WAS FILLED WITH BLINDING SMOKE AND AT THE END OF A FEW MINUTES ATHWART THIS MIST ALL STREAKED WITH FLAME TWO THIRDS OF THE GUNNERS COULD BE DISTINGUISHED LYING BENEATH THE WHEELS OF THE CANNONS
5514-19193-0016 THOSE WHO WERE LEFT STANDING CONTINUED TO SERVE THE PIECES WITH SEVERE TRANQUILLITY BUT THE FIRE HAD SLACKENED THINGS ARE GOING WELL NOW SAID BOSSUET TO ENJOLRAS SUCCESS
5514-19193-0017 ANOTHER QUARTER OF AN HOUR OF THIS SUCCESS AND THERE WILL NOT BE ANY CARTRIDGES LEFT IN THE BARRICADE IT APPEARS THAT GAVROCHE OVERHEARD THIS REMARK CHAPTER FIFTEEN GAVROCHE OUTSIDE
5514-19193-0018 COURFEYRAC SUDDENLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF SOME ONE AT THE BASE OF THE BARRICADE OUTSIDE IN THE STREET AMID THE BULLETS GAVROCHE HAD TAKEN A BOTTLE BASKET FROM THE WINE SHOP HAD MADE HIS WAY OUT THROUGH THE CUT AND WAS QUIETLY ENGAGED IN EMPTYING
5514-19193-0019 THE FULL CARTRIDGE BOXES OF THE NATIONAL GUARDSMEN WHO HAD BEEN KILLED ON THE SLOPE OF THE REDOUBT INTO HIS BASKET WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE ASKED COURFEYRAC GAVROCHE RAISED HIS FACE I'M FILLING MY BASKET CITIZEN DON'T YOU SEE THE GRAPE SHOT
5514-19193-0020 GAVROCHE REPLIED WELL IT IS RAINING WHAT THEN COURFEYRAC SHOUTED COME IN INSTANTER SAID GAVROCHE AND WITH A SINGLE BOUND HE PLUNGED INTO THE STREET
5514-19193-0021 IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT FANNICOT'S COMPANY HAD LEFT BEHIND IT A TRAIL OF BODIES TWENTY CORPSES LAY SCATTERED HERE AND THERE ON THE PAVEMENT THROUGH THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE STREET TWENTY CARTOUCHES FOR GAVROCHE MEANT A PROVISION OF CARTRIDGES FOR THE BARRICADE
5514-19193-0022 THE SMOKE IN THE STREET WAS LIKE A FOG WHOEVER HAS BEHELD A CLOUD WHICH HAS FALLEN INTO A MOUNTAIN GORGE BETWEEN TWO PEAKED ESCARPMENTS CAN IMAGINE THIS SMOKE RENDERED DENSER AND THICKER BY TWO GLOOMY ROWS OF LOFTY HOUSES
5514-19193-0023 IT ROSE GRADUALLY AND WAS INCESSANTLY RENEWED HENCE A TWILIGHT WHICH MADE EVEN THE BROAD DAYLIGHT TURN PALE THE COMBATANTS COULD HARDLY SEE EACH OTHER FROM ONE END OF THE STREET TO THE OTHER SHORT AS IT WAS
5514-19193-0024 THIS OBSCURITY WHICH HAD PROBABLY BEEN DESIRED AND CALCULATED ON BY THE COMMANDERS WHO WERE TO DIRECT THE ASSAULT ON THE BARRICADE WAS USEFUL TO GAVROCHE BENEATH THE FOLDS OF THIS VEIL OF SMOKE AND THANKS TO HIS SMALL SIZE
5514-19193-0025 HE RIFLED THE FIRST SEVEN OR EIGHT CARTRIDGE BOXES WITHOUT MUCH DANGER HE CRAWLED FLAT ON HIS BELLY GALLOPED ON ALL FOURS TOOK HIS BASKET IN HIS TEETH TWISTED GLIDED UNDULATED WOUND FROM ONE DEAD BODY TO ANOTHER
5514-19193-0026 AND EMPTIED THE CARTRIDGE BOX OR CARTOUCHE AS A MONKEY OPENS A NUT THEY DID NOT DARE TO SHOUT TO HIM TO RETURN FROM THE BARRICADE WHICH WAS QUITE NEAR FOR FEAR OF ATTRACTING ATTENTION TO HIM ON ONE BODY THAT OF A CORPORAL HE FOUND A POWDER FLASK
5514-19193-0027 FOR THIRST SAID HE PUTTING IT IN HIS POCKET BY DINT OF ADVANCING HE REACHED A POINT WHERE THE FOG OF THE FUSILLADE BECAME TRANSPARENT SO THAT THE SHARPSHOOTERS OF THE LINE RANGED ON THE OUTLOOK BEHIND THEIR PAVING STONE DIKE
5514-19193-0028 AND THE SHARPSHOOTERS OF THE BANLIEUE MASSED AT THE CORNER OF THE STREET SUDDENLY POINTED OUT TO EACH OTHER SOMETHING MOVING THROUGH THE SMOKE AT THE MOMENT WHEN GAVROCHE WAS RELIEVING A SERGEANT WHO WAS LYING NEAR A STONE DOOR POST OF HIS CARTRIDGES A BULLET STRUCK THE BODY
5514-19193-0029 FICHTRE EJACULATED GAVROCHE THEY ARE KILLING MY DEAD MEN FOR ME A SECOND BULLET STRUCK A SPARK FROM THE PAVEMENT BESIDE HIM A THIRD OVERTURNED HIS BASKET
5514-19193-0030 IT WAS A CHARMING AND TERRIBLE SIGHT GAVROCHE THOUGH SHOT AT WAS TEASING THE FUSILLADE HE HAD THE AIR OF BEING GREATLY DIVERTED IT WAS THE SPARROW PECKING AT THE SPORTSMEN TO EACH DISCHARGE HE RETORTED WITH A COUPLET
5514-19193-0031 THEY AIMED AT HIM CONSTANTLY AND ALWAYS MISSED HIM THE NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND THE SOLDIERS LAUGHED AS THEY TOOK AIM AT HIM HE LAY DOWN SPRANG TO HIS FEET HID IN THE CORNER OF A DOORWAY THEN MADE A BOUND DISAPPEARED RE APPEARED SCAMPERED AWAY RETURNED
5514-19193-0032 REPLIED TO THE GRAPE SHOT WITH HIS THUMB AT HIS NOSE AND ALL THE WHILE WENT ON PILLAGING THE CARTOUCHES EMPTYING THE CARTRIDGE BOXES AND FILLING HIS BASKET THE INSURGENTS PANTING WITH ANXIETY FOLLOWED HIM WITH THEIR EYES THE BARRICADE TREMBLED HE SANG
5514-19193-0033 HE WAS NOT A CHILD HE WAS NOT A MAN HE WAS A STRANGE GAMIN FAIRY HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CALLED THE INVULNERABLE DWARF OF THE FRAY THE BULLETS FLEW AFTER HIM HE WAS MORE NIMBLE THAN THEY HE PLAYED A FEARFUL GAME OF HIDE AND SEEK WITH DEATH
5514-19193-0034 EVERY TIME THAT THE FLAT NOSED FACE OF THE SPECTRE APPROACHED THE URCHIN ADMINISTERED TO IT A FILLIP ONE BULLET HOWEVER BETTER AIMED OR MORE TREACHEROUS THAN THE REST FINALLY STRUCK THE WILL O' THE WISP OF A CHILD
5514-19193-0035 GAVROCHE WAS SEEN TO STAGGER THEN HE SANK TO THE EARTH THE WHOLE BARRICADE GAVE VENT TO A CRY BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING OF ANTAEUS IN THAT PYGMY FOR THE GAMIN TO TOUCH THE PAVEMENT IS THE SAME AS FOR THE GIANT TO TOUCH THE EARTH GAVROCHE HAD FALLEN ONLY TO RISE AGAIN
5561-39621-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN PARRY
5561-39621-0001 AND LENDING AN EAR TO THE VARIOUS NOISES
5561-39621-0002 THE STRANGER DID NOT PAY THEM THE LEAST ATTENTION
5561-39621-0003 WHISPERED MONSIEUR THE DIAMOND HAS BEEN VALUED AH SAID THE TRAVELER WELL WELL MONSIEUR THE JEWELER OF S A R GIVES TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY PISTOLES FOR IT HAVE YOU THEM I THOUGHT IT BEST TO TAKE THEM MONSIEUR

5561-39621-0005 PAY YOURSELF ADDED THE UNKNOWN I WILL DO SO MONSIEUR SINCE YOU SO POSITIVELY REQUIRE IT A SAD SMILE PASSED OVER THE LIPS OF THE GENTLEMAN PLACE THE MONEY ON THAT TRUNK SAID HE TURNING ROUND AND POINTING TO THE PIECE OF FURNITURE
5561-39621-0006 AFTER HAVING TAKEN FROM IT THE AMOUNT OF HIS RECKONING
5561-39621-0007 DINNER HAS ALREADY BEEN REFUSED
5561-39621-0008 THE UNKNOWN ASKED FOR A GLASS OF WINE BROKE OFF A MORSEL OF BREAD AND DID NOT STIR FROM THE WINDOW WHILST HE ATE AND DRANK
5561-39621-0009 CRIES AROSE IN THE DISTANCE A CONFUSED BUZZING FILLED THE LOWER PART OF THE CITY AND THE FIRST DISTINCT SOUND THAT STRUCK THE EARS OF THE STRANGER WAS THE TRAMP OF ADVANCING HORSES
5561-39621-0010 WITH CROPOLE WERE MINGLED AND JOSTLED ON THE STAIRCASE
5561-39621-0011 THE CORTEGE ADVANCED SLOWLY LIGHTED BY A THOUSAND FLAMBEAUX IN THE STREETS AND FROM THE WINDOWS
5561-39621-0012 DRAWN LIKE A CARRIAGE BY FOUR BLACK HORSES
5561-39621-0013 HER GENTLEMEN ON HORSEBACK AT BOTH SIDES THE KING THEN APPEARED MOUNTED UPON A SPLENDID HORSE OF SAXON BREED WITH A FLOWING MANE
5561-39621-0014 THE YOUNG PRINCE EXHIBITED WHEN BOWING TO SOME WINDOWS FROM WHICH ISSUED THE MOST ANIMATED ACCLAMATIONS A NOBLE AND HANDSOME COUNTENANCE ILLUMINATED BY THE FLAMBEAUX OF HIS PAGES BY THE SIDE OF THE KING THOUGH A LITTLE IN THE REAR
5561-39621-0015 AND TWENTY OTHER COURTIERS FOLLOWED BY THEIR PEOPLE AND THEIR BAGGAGE CLOSED THIS VERITABLY TRIUMPHANT MARCH THE POMP WAS OF A MILITARY CHARACTER
5561-39621-0016 WORE TRAVELING DRESSES BUT ALL THE REST WERE CLOTHED IN WARLIKE PANOPLY
5561-39621-0017 WHEN THE KING PASSED BEFORE HIM THE UNKNOWN WHO HAD LEANT FORWARD OVER THE BALCONY TO OBTAIN A BETTER VIEW AND WHO HAD CONCEALED HIS FACE BY LEANING ON HIS ARM FELT HIS HEART SWELL AND OVERFLOW WITH A BITTER JEALOUSY THE NOISE OF THE TRUMPETS EXCITED HIM
5561-39621-0018 THE POPULAR ACCLAMATIONS DEAFENED HIM FOR A MOMENT HE ALLOWED HIS REASON TO BE ABSORBED IN THIS FLOOD OF LIGHTS TUMULT AND BRILLIANT IMAGES HE IS A KING MURMURED HE IN AN ACCENT OF DESPAIR THEN BEFORE HE HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS SOMBRE REVERIE
5561-39621-0019 ALL THE NOISE ALL THE SPLENDOR HAD PASSED AWAY AT THE ANGLE OF THE STREET THERE REMAINED NOTHING BENEATH THE STRANGER BUT A FEW HOARSE DISCORDANT VOICES SHOUTING AT INTERVALS VIVE LE ROI
5561-39621-0020 HOW GOOD LOOKING THE KING IS HOW STRONGLY HE RESEMBLES HIS ILLUSTRIOUS FATHER A HANDSOME LIKENESS SAID PITTRINO
5561-39621-0021 CROPOLE WAS FEEDING THEIR GOSSIP WITH HIS OWN PERSONAL REMARKS WITHOUT OBSERVING THAT AN OLD MAN ON FOOT BUT LEADING A SMALL IRISH HORSE BY THE BRIDLE WAS ENDEAVORING TO PENETRATE THE CROWD OF MEN AND WOMEN WHICH BLOCKED UP THE ENTRANCE TO THE MEDICI BUT AT THAT MOMENT THE VOICE OF THE STRANGER WAS HEARD FROM THE WINDOW
5561-39621-0022 MAKE WAY MONSIEUR L'HOTELIER TO THE ENTRANCE OF YOUR HOUSE
5561-39621-0023 THE WINDOW WAS INSTANTLY CLOSED PITTRINO POINTED OUT THE WAY TO THE NEWLY ARRIVED GUEST WHO ENTERED WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD THE STRANGER WAITED FOR HIM ON THE LANDING HE OPENED HIS ARMS TO THE OLD MAN AND LED HIM TO A SEAT

5561-39621-0030 THEN THE GENERAL SENT ME BACK THE LETTER BY AN AIDE DE CAMP INFORMING ME THAT IF I WERE FOUND THE NEXT DAY WITHIN THE CIRCUMSCRIPTION OF HIS COMMAND HE WOULD HAVE ME ARRESTED
5561-39621-0031 WHAT ARREST YOU MY MOST FAITHFUL SERVANT YES MY LORD AND NOTWITHSTANDING YOU HAD SIGNED THE NAME PARRY TO ALL MY LETTERS MY LORD
5561-39621-0032 THE YOUNG MAN LEANED FORWARD THOUGHTFUL AND SAD AY THAT'S WHAT HE DID BEFORE HIS PEOPLE SAID HE ENDEAVORING TO CHEAT HIMSELF WITH HOPES BUT PRIVATELY BETWEEN YOU AND HIM WHAT DID HE DO ANSWER
5561-39621-0033 THESE CAVALIERS CONDUCTED ME IN GREAT HASTE TO THE LITTLE PORT OF TENBY THREW ME RATHER THAN EMBARKED ME INTO A LITTLE FISHING BOAT ABOUT TO SAIL FOR BRITTANY AND HERE I AM OH SIGHED THE YOUNG MAN CLASPING HIS NECK CONVULSIVELY WITH HIS HAND AND WITH A SOB
5561-39621-0034 PARRY IS THAT ALL IS THAT ALL YES MY LORD THAT IS ALL AFTER THIS BRIEF REPLY ENSUED A LONG INTERVAL OF SILENCE BROKEN ONLY BY THE CONVULSIVE BEATING OF THE HEEL OF THE YOUNG MAN ON THE FLOOR
5561-39621-0035 THE OLD MAN ENDEAVORED TO CHANGE THE CONVERSATION IT WAS LEADING TO THOUGHTS MUCH TOO SINISTER
5561-39621-0036 WHAT IS THE MEANING OF ALL THE NOISE WHICH PRECEDED ME WHAT ARE THESE PEOPLE CRYING VIVE LE ROI FOR WHAT KING DO THEY MEAN
5561-39621-0037 AH PARRY REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN IRONICALLY

5561-39621-0039 AND CONDUCTS HIM TO A RICH BRIDE THEN ALL THESE PEOPLE REJOICE THEY LOVE THEIR KING
5561-39621-0040 WELL WELL MY LORD SAID PARRY MORE UNEASY AT THE TURN THE CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN THAN AT THE OTHER YOU KNOW RESUMED THE UNKNOWN THAT MY MOTHER AND MY SISTER WHILST ALL THIS IS GOING ON IN HONOR OF THE KING OF FRANCE HAVE NEITHER MONEY NOR BREAD YOU KNOW THAT I MYSELF SHALL BE POOR AND DEGRADED WITHIN A FORTNIGHT
5561-39621-0041 PARRY ARE THERE NOT EXAMPLES IN WHICH A MAN OF MY CONDITION SHOULD HIMSELF MY LORD IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN
5561-39621-0042 NO NO I HAVE TWO ARMS PARRY AND I HAVE A SWORD AND HE STRUCK HIS ARM VIOLENTLY WITH HIS HAND AND TOOK DOWN HIS SWORD WHICH HUNG AGAINST THE WALL

5561-39621-0044 AND WITH THESE WORDS WHICH HE FINISHED SHARPLY WITH A NERVOUS AND TERRIBLE LAUGH THE YOUNG MAN GIRDED ON HIS SWORD TOOK HIS HAT FROM THE TRUNK
5561-39621-0045 MY GOOD PARRY SAID HE ORDER A FIRE DRINK EAT SLEEP AND BE HAPPY LET US BOTH BE HAPPY MY FAITHFUL FRIEND MY ONLY FRIEND WE ARE RICH AS RICH AS KINGS
5561-41615-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN A WOULD BE LARK
5561-41615-0001 THE MAJORITY HOWEVER APPEARED TO BE HIGHLY DELIGHTED OVER WHAT THEY HEARD ONE GROUP STANDING NEAR ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF WHICH ELEANOR WAS THE CENTER LAUGHED SO LOUDLY THAT THEY WERE SENT TO THEIR SEATS
5561-41615-0002 AND AS THE MORNING ADVANCED THEY BECAME FULLY AWARE THAT SOMETHING UNUSUAL WAS IN THE WIND SEVERAL TIMES THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF A FOLDED PAPER BEING STEALTHILY PASSED FROM ONE DESK TO ANOTHER BUT AS TO ITS CONTENTS THEY HAD NO IDEA AS IT WAS NOT HANDED TO ANY ONE OF THEM
5561-41615-0003 AT RECESS THERE WAS MORE GROUPING AND WHISPERING AND GRACE WAS PUZZLED AND NOT A LITTLE HURT OVER THE WAY IN WHICH SHE AND HER FRIENDS WERE IGNORED SUCH A THING HAD NOT HAPPENED SINCE THE BASKETBALL TROUBLE THE PREVIOUS YEAR
5561-41615-0004 ELEANOR STARTED THAT PAPER WHATEVER IT IS SAID NORA O'MALLEY TO THE PHI SIGMA TAU WHO STOOD IN A GROUP AROUND HER DESK SHE WAS HERE WHEN I CAME IN THIS MORNING AND I WAS EARLY TOO IT
5561-41615-0005 HERE COMES MABEL SAID JESSICA MAYBE SHE HAS SEEN THE PAPER
5561-41615-0006 MABEL NODDED WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON IT MABEL ASKED GRACE CURIOUSLY MABEL LOOKED DISTRESSED FOR A MOMENT THEN SHE SAID
5561-41615-0007 BUT I GAVE MY WORD OF HONOR BEFORE I READ IT THAT I WOULDN'T MENTION THE CONTENTS TO ANY ONE THEN OF COURSE WE WON'T ASK YOU SAID ANNE PIERSON QUICKLY BUT TELL US THIS MUCH IS IT ABOUT ANY OF US NO REPLIED MABEL IT ISN'T IT IS SOMETHING I WAS ASKED TO SIGN
5561-41615-0008 AND DID YOU SIGN IT ASKED JESSICA I CERTAINLY DID NOT RESPONDED MABEL IT WAS SHE STOPPED THEN FLUSHED
5561-41615-0009 I CAN'T BEAR TO HAVE SECRETS AND NOT TELL YOU
5561-41615-0010 WE DON'T WANT YOU TO TELL IF IT DOESN'T CONCERN US WE DON'T CARE DO WE GIRLS NO INDEED WAS THE REPLY JUST THEN THE BELL SOUNDED AND THE GIRLS RETURNED TO THEIR SEATS WITH THE RIDDLE STILL UNSOLVED
5561-41615-0011 ON WEDNESDAY ASIDE FROM A LITTLE MORE WHISPERING AND SIGNIFICANT GLANCES EXCHANGED AMONG THE PUPILS NOT A RIPPLE DISTURBED THE CALM OF THE STUDY HALL IT WAS THEREFORE A DISTINCT AND NOT ALTOGETHER PLEASANT SURPRISE WHEN MISS THOMPSON WALKED INTO THE ROOM
5561-41615-0012 DISMISSED THE SENIOR CLASS AND REQUESTED THE THREE LOWER CLASSES TO REMAIN IN THEIR SEATS AFTER THE SENIORS HAD QUIETLY LEFT THE STUDY HALL MISS THOMPSON STOOD GRAVELY REGARDING THE ROWS OF GIRLS BEFORE HER HER EYES WANDERED TOWARD WHERE ELEANOR SAT LOOKING BORED AND INDIFFERENT
5561-41615-0013 AND THEN SHE LOOKED TOWARD GRACE WHOSE STEADY GRAY EYES WERE FIXED ON THE PRINCIPAL'S FACE WITH RESPECTFUL ATTENTION I DON'T BELIEVE GRACE IS GUILTY AT ANY RATE THOUGHT MISS THOMPSON THEN SHE ADDRESSED THE ASSEMBLED GIRLS SOMETHING HAS COME TO MY EARS GIRLS SAID THE PRINCIPAL
5561-41615-0014 THAT I FIND HARD TO CREDIT BUT BEFORE YOU LEAVE HERE THIS AFTERNOON I MUST KNOW WHO IS INNOCENT AND WHO IS GUILTY MISS THOMPSON PAUSED AND A NUMBER OF GIRLS STIRRED UNEASILY IN THEIR SEATS WHILE A FEW GLANCED QUICKLY TOWARD ELEANOR WHO WAS LOOKING STRAIGHT AHEAD THE PICTURE OF INNOCENCE
5561-41615-0015 THAT IT IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN FOR ANY PUPIL TO ABSENT HERSELF FROM SCHOOL FOR THE PURPOSE OF ATTENDING A CIRCUS MATINEE OR ANY PUBLIC PERFORMANCE OF THIS NATURE I HAVE SO SEVERELY DISCIPLINED PUPILS FOR THIS OFFENCE THAT FOR A LONG TIME NO ONE HAS DISOBEYED ME
5561-41615-0016 I WAS THEREFORE ASTONISHED TO LEARN THAT A NUMBER OF GIRLS REGARDLESS OF RULES HAVE TAKEN MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS AND HAVE DECIDED TO ABSENT THEMSELVES FROM SCHOOL TO MORROW IN ORDER TO ATTEND THE MATINEE TO BE GIVEN IN THE THEATRE
5561-41615-0017 SUCH A DECISION IS WORSE THAN DISOBEDIENCE IT IS LAWLESSNESS
5561-41615-0018 THE STANDARD OF THE SCHOOL WILL BE LOWERED THEREFORE I INTEND TO SIFT THIS MATTER TO THE BOTTOM AND FIND OUT WHAT MISCHIEVOUS INFLUENCE PROMPTED THIS ACT OF INSUBORDINATION REPORT SAYS THAT THIS MOVEMENT ORIGINATED IN THE JUNIOR CLASS
5561-41615-0019 AND THAT A PAPER HAS BEEN CIRCULATED AND SIGNED BY CERTAIN PUPILS WHO PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO PLAY TRUANT AND ATTEND THE MATINEE TO MORROW THE EYES OF GRACE AND HER CHUMS TURNED QUESTIONINGLY TOWARD MABEL ALLISON WHO NODDED SLIGHTLY IN THE AFFIRMATIVE SO THAT WAS WHAT ALL THE WHISPERING AND MYSTERY HAD MEANT
5561-41615-0020 GRACE INWARDLY CONGRATULATED HERSELF ON HAVING KEPT CLEAR OF THE WHOLE THING NONE OF HER FRIENDS WERE IMPLICATED EITHER EVEN MABEL HAD REFUSED TO SIGN
5561-41615-0021 WHAT I INSIST UPON KNOWING NOW IS WHO ARE THE REAL CULPRITS BEGINNING WITH THE GIRL WHO ORIGINATED THE PAPER TO THE LAST ONE WHO SIGNED IT
5561-41615-0022 HER EXAMPLE WAS FOLLOWED UNTIL TWO THIRDS OF THE GIRLS PRESENT WERE STANDING THE PRINCIPAL STOOD SILENTLY REGARDING THEM WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SEVERITY THAT WAS DECIDEDLY DISCOMFITTING THAT WILL DO SHE SAID CURTLY
5561-41615-0023 AFTER THEY HAD STOOD FOR WHAT SEEMED TO THEM AN AGE BUT WAS REALLY ONLY A COUPLE OF MINUTES YOU MAY BE SEATED THE GIRL WHO COMPOSED AND WROTE THAT AGREEMENT WILL NOW RISE AND EXPLAIN HERSELF WITHOUT HESITATING ELEANOR ROSE AND REGARDED THE PRINCIPAL WITH AN INSOLENT SMILE
5561-41615-0024 I WROTE IT MISS THOMPSON SHE SAID CLEARLY I WROTE IT BECAUSE I WISHED TO
5561-41615-0025 BECAUSE IT HAS SPOILED ALL OUR FUN THERE WAS A GASP OF HORROR AT ELEANOR'S ASSERTION NO ONE HAD EVER BEFORE SPOKEN SO DISRESPECTFULLY TO THEIR REVERED PRINCIPAL MISS SAVELL SAID THE PRINCIPAL QUIETLY ALTHOUGH HER FLASHING EYES AND SET LIPS SHOWED THAT SHE WAS VERY ANGRY
5561-41615-0026 IF YOU HAVE THAT PAPER IN YOUR POSSESSION BRING IT TO ME AT ONCE AND NEVER ANSWER ME AGAIN AS YOU DID JUST NOW YOU ARE BOTH DISRESPECTFUL AND IMPERTINENT BUT MISS THOMPSON'S ANGER TOWARD ELEANOR WAS NOTHING COMPARED WITH THE TEMPEST THAT THE PRINCIPAL HAD AROUSED IN ELEANOR
5561-41615-0027 THE LATTER FLUSHED THEN TURNED PERFECTLY WHITE WITH RAGE STILL STANDING SHE REACHED DOWN
5561-41615-0028 WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS MY CONTEMPT FOR THEM AND RIGHT HERE I ACCUSE GRACE HARLOWE AND HER SORORITY OF GETTING THE INFORMATION FROM MABEL ALLISON YESTERDAY AND CARRYING IT TO YOU THEY ARE ALL TALE BEARERS AND SNEAKS
5561-41615-0029 WITH THESE WORDS ELEANOR ANGRILY FLUNG THE BOOK SHE HELD ON THE DESK AND WALKED DOWN THE AISLE TOWARD THE DOOR BUT MISS THOMPSON BARRED HER WAY STOP MISS SAVELL SHE COMMANDED
5561-41615-0030 I WILL NOT TOLERATE SUCH BEHAVIOR ELEANOR GLARED AT THE PRINCIPAL WHOSE FACE WAS RIGID IN ITS PURPOSE THEN SANK INTO THE NEAREST VACANT SEAT SAYING DEFIANTLY YOU MAY KEEP ME HERE ALL NIGHT IF YOU LIKE
5561-41615-0031 NEVERTHELESS SHE DID NOT AGAIN ATTEMPT TO LEAVE THE ROOM SHE HAD MET WITH A WILL STRONGER THAN HER OWN AND SHE REALIZED IT IGNORING ELEANOR'S FINAL REMARK MISS THOMPSON ONCE MORE TURNED HER ATTENTION TO THE MATTER IN HAND
5561-41615-0032 THOSE GIRLS WHO ARE NOT IN ANY WAY IMPLICATED IN THIS MATTER ARE DISMISSED SHE SAID ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE GIRLS AROSE AND PREPARED TO LEAVE THE STUDY HALL THE PHI SIGMA TAU BEING AMONG THE NUMBER
5561-41615-0033 GRACE MOTIONED THE GIRLS TO HURRY SHE WISHED TO LEAVE THE ROOM WITH HER FRIENDS BEFORE MISS THOMPSON NOTICED THEM SHE KNEW THE PRINCIPAL WOULD INSIST ON AN APOLOGY FROM ELEANOR AND NEITHER SHE NOR HER FRIENDS WISHED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE ELEANOR HAD CHOSEN TO CUT THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
5561-41615-0034 GRACE WAS THOROUGHLY ANGRY WITH HER SHE COULD NOT FORGIVE ELEANOR FOR HAVING ACCUSED HER AND HER FRIENDS OF CARRYING TALES BEFORE ALMOST THE ENTIRE SCHOOL THEREFORE A FORCED APOLOGY WOULD NOT APPEASE HER WOUNDED PRIDE
5561-41615-0035 SHE DREW A BREATH OF RELIEF WHEN THE EIGHT GIRLS WERE SAFELY OUTSIDE THE STUDY HALL DOOR HURRY UP SHE SAID WE'LL TALK WHEN WE GET OUTSIDE SCHOOL DON'T STOP FOR A MINUTE IF MISS THOMPSON NOTICES THAT WE ARE GONE SHE'LL SEND AFTER US
5561-41615-0036 THE GIRLS SILENTLY DONNED THEIR WRAPS AND FLED FROM THE BUILDING LIKE FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE ONCE ON THE STREET A LIVELY CONFAB ENSUED ALL TALKING AT ONCE LET'S TAKE TURNS TALKING CRIED GRACE LAUGHING WE SHALL UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER A LITTLE BETTER
5561-41615-0037 SHE HAS CERTAINLY SHOWN HER TRUE COLORS THIS TIME I NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING MORE UNJUST THAN THE WAY SHE ACCUSED US WHEN WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HER OLD PLAN SAID MARIAN BARBER IT WAS ABOMINABLE SAID EVA ALLEN THE OTHER GIRLS EXPRESSED THEIR DISAPPROVAL IN EQUALLY FRANK TERMS
5561-41615-0038 I SUPPOSE IT DID LOOK AS THOUGH I TOLD YOU GIRLS SAID MABEL ALLISON WHO HAD JOINED THEM AT THE GATE YOU KNOW I WAS WITH YOU AT RECESS RIGHT AFTER THE PAPER HAD BEEN PASSED TO ME
5561-41615-0039 IT WAS PASSED TO ME BY MISTAKE VERY LIKELY AGREED GRACE I WONDER WHO DID TELL MISS THOMPSON I SAW SEVERAL GIRLS WITH THE PAPER
5561-41615-0040 THERE WILL BE WEEPING AND WAILING IN THE SKULL AND CROSSBONES CROWD EXCLAIMED NORA THEY ARE ALL IN THIS MIX UP AND IF THEY AREN'T SUSPENDED THEY'LL BE LUCKY
5561-41615-0041 NO SAID GRACE SHORTLY SHE DESERVES TO BE PUNISHED THE THINGS SHE SAID TO MISS THOMPSON WERE DISGRACEFUL AND I SHALL NEVER FORGIVE HER FOR THE WAY SHE SPOKE OF US I WOULDN'T SAY THAT GRACE REMARKED ANNE YOU CAN NEVER TELL WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO CHANGE YOUR VIEWS
5561-41615-0042 IT WILL HAVE TO BE SOMETHING REMARKABLE IN THIS INSTANCE REPLIED GRACE GRIMLY AS SHE BADE THE GIRLS GOOD BYE REMEMBER GIRLS BASKETBALL PRACTICE AGAIN TO MORROW AND THE REST OF THE WEEK MISS THOMPSON HAS PROMISED ME THE GYMNASIUM PLEASE MAKE IT A POINT TO BE ON HAND
5561-41615-0043 GOOD BYE GRACE CHORUSED HER FRIENDS AND WENT ON DOWN THE STREET DISCUSSING THE PROBABLE FATE OF THE WOULD BE TRUANTS TO RETURN TO THOSE YOUTHFUL TRANSGRESSORS THEY WERE SPENDING A MOST UNCOMFORTABLE HALF HOUR WITH MISS THOMPSON SHE WAS MERCILESS IN HER DENUNCIATION OF THEIR CONDUCT
5561-41615-0044 AND THE TERROR OF SUSPENSION AROSE IN MORE THAN ONE MIND AS THEY LISTENED TO HER SCATHING REMARKS
5561-41615-0045 BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT IT NOW WHEN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ELEANOR THE PRINCIPAL DISMISSED THEM THEY FILED DECOROUSLY OUT VERY UNEASY IN MIND MISS THOMPSON HAD TAKEN THEIR NAMES BUT HAD NOT STATED THEIR PUNISHMENT AND IT WAS CERTAIN THAT THEY WOULD BE MADE TO FEEL THE FULL WEIGHT OF HER DISPLEASURE
5561-41615-0046 WHEN THE LAST GIRL HAD DISAPPEARED THE PRINCIPAL TURNED TO ELEANOR
5561-41615-0047 DO YOU INTEND TO OBEY ME MISS SAVELL ASKED MISS THOMPSON STILL THERE WAS NO ANSWER VERY WELL CONTINUED MISS THOMPSON YOUR SILENCE INDICATES THAT YOU ARE STILL INSUBORDINATE YOU MAY THEREFORE CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO THINGS
5561-41615-0048 YOU MAY APOLOGIZE TO ME NOW AND TO MORROW TO THE GIRLS YOU HAVE ACCUSED OF TREACHERY
5561-41616-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE JUNIORS FOREVER WHEN THE FOUR CLASSES ASSEMBLED THURSDAY MORNING EVERY GIRL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ELEANOR WAS IN HER SEAT
5561-41616-0001 AFTER CONDUCTING OPENING EXERCISES MISS THOMPSON PRONOUNCED SENTENCE ON THE CULPRITS THEY WERE TO FORFEIT THEIR RECESS LIBRARY AND ALL OTHER PRIVILEGES UNTIL THE END OF THE TERM
5561-41616-0002 THEY MUST TURN IN TWO THEMES EVERY WEEK OF NOT LESS THAN SIX HUNDRED WORDS ON CERTAIN SUBJECTS TO BE ASSIGNED TO THEM IF DURING THIS TIME ANY ONE OF THEM SHOULD BE REPORTED FOR A MISDEMEANOR THEY WERE TO BE SUSPENDED WITHOUT DELAY
5561-41616-0003 THEIR PENALTY WAS FAR FROM LIGHT BUT THEY HAD NOT BEEN SUSPENDED AND SO THEY RESOLVED TO ENDURE IT AS BEST THEY MIGHT GRACE HARLOWE FELT A LOAD LIFTED FROM HER MIND WHEN MISS THOMPSON PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED THAT SHE HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION FROM EITHER MABEL ALLISON OR THE PHI SIGMA TAU
5561-41616-0004 THANK GOODNESS NONE OF US WERE CONCERNED IN THAT AFFAIR SHE TOLD THE MEMBERS OF HER BASKETBALL TEAM AT RECESS THERE ARE TWO GIRLS ON THE SOPHOMORE AND THREE ON THE FRESHMAN TEAM WHOSE BASKETBALL ARDOR WILL HAVE TO COOL UNTIL AFTER THE MID YEAR EXAMS

5561-41616-0030 AND THE SENSATIONAL PLAYING OF NORA AND MIRIAM WAS A MATTER OF WONDER TO THE SPECTATORS WHO CONCEDED IT TO BE THE FASTEST MOST BRILLIANT HALF EVER PLAYED BY AN OAKDALE TEAM
5561-41616-0031 WHOSE LOYAL SUPPORTERS SWOOPED DOWN UPON THEM THE MOMENT THE WHISTLE BLEW AND PRANCED ABOUT WHOOPING LIKE SAVAGES THAT WAS THE GREATEST GAME I EVER SAW PLAYED UNDER THIS ROOF CRIED DAVID WRINGING GRACE'S HAND WHILE HIPPY HOPPED ABOUT UTTERING LITTLE YELPS OF JOY
5561-41616-0032 REDDY CIRCLED ABOUT THE VICTORS ALMOST TOO DELIGHTED FOR WORDS HE WAS FILLED WITH PROFOUND ADMIRATION FOR THEM THE BOYS CRACK TEAM COULDN'T HAVE PLAYED A BETTER GAME HE SAID SOLEMNLY AND THE GIRLS KNEW THAT HE COULD PAY THEM NO HIGHER COMPLIMENT FOR THIS TEAM WAS CONSIDERED INVINCIBLE BY THE HIGH SCHOOL BOYS
5561-41616-0033 PERHAPS WE'LL CHALLENGE YOU SOME DAY REDDY SAID GRACE MISCHIEVOUSLY I BELIEVE YOU'D WIN AT THAT HE SAID SO EARNESTLY THAT EVERY ONE LAUGHED IT WAS A GREAT TRIUMPH SAID JESSICA PROUDLY AS SHE STOOD WITH MABEL AND ANNE IN THE LOCKER ROOM WHILE THE GIRLS RESUMED STREET CLOTHING AND MY NEW HOWL WAS A SUCCESS TOO
5561-41616-0034 GLAD TO KNOW THAT SAID GRACE THERE WERE SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF NOISES I COULDN'T DISTINGUISH IT THERE WAS ONE NOISE THAT STARTED THAT WAS PROMPTLY HUSHED SAID ANNE YOU HEARD IT TOO DIDN'T YOU JESSICA OH YES GIRLS I INTENDED TELLING YOU BEFORE THIS REPLIED JESSICA
5561-41616-0035 JUST BEFORE THE LAST HALF STARTED MISS THOMPSON AND MISS KANE CAME IN AND WALKED TO THE OTHER END OF THE GALLERY WELL ELEANOR AND HER CROWD SAW THEM
5561-41616-0036 HARD TO TELL SAID NORA THEY HISSED MISS THOMPSON VERY SOFTLY YOU MAY BE SURE CONTINUED JESSICA BUT IT WAS HISSING JUST THE SAME
5561-41616-0037 THEY WERE SITTING DOWN FRONT ON THE SAME SIDE AS ELEANOR'S CROWD YOU KNOW WHAT A TEMPER RUTH DEANE HAS AND HOW FEROCIOUS SHE CAN LOOK
5561-41616-0038 SHE TALKED FOR A MOMENT TO EDNA AND ELEANOR THEY TOSSED THEIR HEADS BUT THEY DIDN'T HISS ANY MORE WHAT DID RUTH SAY TO THEM ASKED GRACE CURIOUSLY
5652-19215-0000 EVERYTHING WAS MADE READY FOR THE WEDDING THE DOCTOR ON BEING CONSULTED DECLARED THAT IT MIGHT TAKE PLACE IN FEBRUARY IT WAS THEN DECEMBER A FEW RAVISHING WEEKS OF PERFECT HAPPINESS PASSED
5652-19215-0001 THE GRANDFATHER WAS NOT THE LEAST HAPPY OF THEM ALL HE REMAINED FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AT A TIME GAZING AT COSETTE THE WONDERFUL BEAUTIFUL GIRL HE EXCLAIMED AND SHE HAS SO SWEET AND GOOD AN AIR
5652-19215-0002 SHE IS WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE MOST CHARMING GIRL THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE LATER ON SHE'LL HAVE VIRTUES WITH AN ODOR OF VIOLETS HOW GRACEFUL ONE CANNOT LIVE OTHERWISE THAN NOBLY WITH SUCH A CREATURE
5652-19215-0003 MARIUS MY BOY YOU ARE A BARON YOU ARE RICH DON'T GO TO PETTIFOGGING I BEG OF YOU
5652-19215-0004 THE TRANSITION HAD NOT BEEN SOFTENED AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN STUNNED HAD THEY NOT BEEN DAZZLED BY IT DO YOU UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT IT SAID MARIUS TO COSETTE NO REPLIED COSETTE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE GOOD GOD IS CARING FOR US
5652-19215-0005 JEAN VALJEAN DID EVERYTHING SMOOTHED AWAY EVERY DIFFICULTY ARRANGED EVERYTHING MADE EVERYTHING EASY
5652-19215-0006 AND APPARENTLY WITH AS MUCH JOY AS COSETTE HERSELF AS HE HAD BEEN A MAYOR HE UNDERSTOOD HOW TO SOLVE THAT DELICATE PROBLEM
5652-19215-0007 A SURE MEANS OF NOT ENCOUNTERING ANY OBJECTIONS COSETTE WAS THE ONLY SCION OF AN EXTINCT FAMILY COSETTE WAS NOT HIS OWN DAUGHTER BUT THE DAUGHTER OF THE OTHER FAUCHELEVENT TWO BROTHERS FAUCHELEVENT HAD BEEN GARDENERS TO THE CONVENT
5652-19215-0008 PICPUS INQUIRY WAS MADE AT THAT CONVENT THE VERY BEST INFORMATION AND THE MOST RESPECTABLE REFERENCES ABOUNDED THE GOOD NUNS NOT VERY APT AND BUT LITTLE INCLINED TO FATHOM QUESTIONS OF PATERNITY
5652-19215-0009 OF WHICH OF THE TWO FAUCHELEVENTS COSETTE WAS THE DAUGHTER THEY SAID WHAT WAS WANTED AND THEY SAID IT WITH ZEAL AN ACTE DE NOTORIETE WAS DRAWN UP COSETTE BECAME IN THE EYES OF THE LAW MADEMOISELLE EUPHRASIE FAUCHELEVENT
5652-19215-0010 SHE WAS DECLARED AN ORPHAN BOTH FATHER AND MOTHER BEING DEAD
5652-19215-0011 THAT HE WAS APPOINTED UNDER THE NAME OF FAUCHELEVENT AS COSETTE'S GUARDIAN
5652-19215-0012 AS FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND FRANCS THEY CONSTITUTED A LEGACY BEQUEATHED TO COSETTE BY A DEAD PERSON WHO DESIRED TO REMAIN UNKNOWN THE ORIGINAL LEGACY HAD CONSISTED OF FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR THOUSAND FRANCS
5652-19215-0013 BUT TEN THOUSAND FRANCS HAD BEEN EXPENDED ON THE EDUCATION OF MADEMOISELLE EUPHRASIE FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS OF THAT AMOUNT HAVING BEEN PAID TO THE CONVENT THIS LEGACY DEPOSITED IN THE HANDS OF A THIRD PARTY
5652-19215-0014 WAS TO BE TURNED OVER TO COSETTE AT HER MAJORITY OR AT THE DATE OF HER MARRIAGE THIS TAKEN AS A WHOLE WAS VERY ACCEPTABLE AS THE READER WILL PERCEIVE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SUM DUE WAS HALF A MILLION THERE WERE SOME PECULIARITIES HERE AND THERE IT IS TRUE
5652-19215-0015 THAT THE CLOUD DID NOT LAST LONG SHE HAD MARIUS THE YOUNG MAN ARRIVED THE OLD MAN WAS EFFACED SUCH IS LIFE AND THEN COSETTE HAD FOR LONG YEARS BEEN HABITUATED TO SEEING ENIGMAS AROUND HER
5652-19215-0016 A MYSTERIOUS CHILDHOOD IS ALWAYS PREPARED FOR CERTAIN RENUNCIATIONS
5652-19215-0017 IT IS TRUE THAT HE OVERWHELMED HER WITH GALLANT COMPLIMENTS AND PRESENTS WHILE JEAN VALJEAN WAS BUILDING UP FOR COSETTE A NORMAL SITUATION IN SOCIETY AND AN UNASSAILABLE STATUS
5652-19215-0018 NOTHING SO AMUSED HIM AS BEING MAGNIFICENT HE HAD GIVEN TO COSETTE
5652-19215-0019 DAUPHINES WITHOUT A RIGHT OR WRONG SIDE IN THE PIECE
5652-19215-0020 PARURES IN ANTIQUE GOLDSMITH'S WORK IVORY BON BON BOXES ORNAMENTED WITH MICROSCOPIC BATTLES GEWGAWS AND RIBBONS HE LAVISHED EVERYTHING ON COSETTE COSETTE AMAZED
5652-19215-0021 HER WEDDING BASKET SEEMED TO HER TO BE UPHELD BY SERAPHIM
5652-19215-0022 WITH WINGS OF MECHLIN LACE THE INTOXICATION OF THE LOVERS WAS ONLY EQUALLED AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID BY THE ECSTASY OF THE GRANDFATHER
5652-19215-0023 EVERY MORNING A FRESH OFFERING OF BRIC A BRAC FROM THE GRANDFATHER TO COSETTE ALL POSSIBLE KNICKKNACKS GLITTERED AROUND HER ONE DAY MARIUS WHO WAS FOND OF TALKING GRAVELY IN THE MIDST OF HIS BLISS SAID
5652-19215-0024 THE MEN OF THE REVOLUTION ARE SO GREAT THAT THEY HAVE THE PRESTIGE OF THE AGES LIKE CATO
5652-19215-0025 THANKS MARIUS THAT IS PRECISELY THE IDEA OF WHICH I WAS IN SEARCH AND ON THE FOLLOWING DAY A MAGNIFICENT DRESS OF TEA ROSE COLORED MOIRE ANTIQUE WAS ADDED TO COSETTE'S WEDDING PRESENTS
5652-19215-0026 HER HEART AND THE LOUVRE HER HEART AND THE GRAND WATERWORKS OF VERSAILLES GIVE ME MY SHEPHERDESS AND TRY TO MAKE HER A DUCHESS FETCH ME PHYLLIS CROWNED WITH CORN FLOWERS AND ADD A HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS INCOME
5652-19215-0027 I REMEMBER TO HAVE SEEN IN THE CATHEDRAL OF STRASBURG A CLOCK
5652-19215-0028 WHICH HAD THE KINDNESS TO INDICATE THE HOUR BUT WHICH HAD NOT THE AIR OF BEING MADE FOR THAT AND WHICH
5652-19215-0029 EQUAL TO THAT FOR MY PART I AM OF THE OPINION OF THE BIG CLOCK OF STRASBURG AND I PREFER IT TO THE CUCKOO CLOCK FROM THE BLACK FOREST
5652-19215-0030 IT IGNORES THE NOBLE IN EVERYTHING IT IS CLEAN SHAVEN YOUR THIRD ESTATE IS INSIPID COLORLESS ODORLESS AND SHAPELESS THE DREAMS OF YOUR BOURGEOIS WHO SET UP AS THEY EXPRESS IT A PRETTY BOUDOIR
5652-19215-0031 FRESHLY DECORATED VIOLET EBONY AND CALICO MAKE WAY MAKE WAY THE SIEUR CURMUDGEON IS MARRYING MADEMOISELLE CLUTCH PENNY SUMPTUOUSNESS AND SPLENDOR
5652-19215-0032 I PREDICT THAT ALL WAS LOST
5652-19215-0033 I GRANT TO THIS AGE THE DEVICE DIRTY CLEANLINESS
5652-19215-0034 GIVE ME PERMISSION TO SPEAK I SAY NO EVIL OF THE PEOPLE AS YOU SEE I AM ALWAYS HARPING ON YOUR PEOPLE
5652-19215-0035 I BELONG TO IT HE WHO LOVES WELL LASHES WELL THEREUPON I SAY PLAINLY THAT NOW A DAYS
5652-19215-0036 AH IT IS TRUE I REGRET THE GRACE OF THE ANCIENT MANNERS I REGRET EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM THEIR ELEGANCE THEIR CHIVALRY
5652-19215-0037 THAT JOYOUS LUXURY WHICH EVERY ONE POSSESSED MUSIC FORMING PART OF THE WEDDING A SYMPHONY ABOVE STAIRS A BEATING OF DRUMS BELOW STAIRS THE DANCES THE JOYOUS FACES ROUND THE TABLE
5652-19215-0038 THE FINE SPUN GALLANT COMPLIMENTS THE SONGS THE FIREWORKS THE FRANK LAUGHTER THE DEVIL'S OWN ROW THE HUGE KNOTS OF RIBBON I REGRET THE BRIDE'S GARTER THE BRIDE'S GARTER IS COUSIN TO THE GIRDLE OF VENUS
5652-19215-0039 ON WHAT DOES THE WAR OF TROY TURN ON HELEN'S GARTER PARBLEU WHY DID THEY FIGHT WHY DID DIOMED
5652-19215-0040 THAT GREAT BRAZEN HELMET OF TEN POINTS WHY DID ACHILLES AND HECTOR HEW EACH OTHER UP WITH VAST BLOWS OF THEIR LANCES BECAUSE HELEN ALLOWED PARIS TO TAKE HER GARTER WITH COSETTE'S GARTER
5652-19215-0041 HOMER WOULD CONSTRUCT THE ILIAD HE WOULD PUT IN HIS POEM
5652-19215-0042 AND HE WOULD CALL HIM NESTOR MY FRIENDS IN BYGONE DAYS IN THOSE AMIABLE DAYS OF YORE PEOPLE MARRIED WISELY THEY HAD A GOOD CONTRACT AND THEN THEY HAD A GOOD CAROUSE
5652-19215-0043 GAMACHO ENTERED BUT IN SOOTH THE STOMACH IS AN AGREEABLE BEAST WHICH DEMANDS ITS DUE AND WHICH WANTS TO HAVE ITS WEDDING ALSO
5652-19215-0044 ONLY MODERATELY CONCEALED OH THE LARGE LAUGHING MOUTHS AND HOW GAY WE WERE IN THOSE DAYS YOUTH WAS A BOUQUET
5652-19215-0045 OR A TUFT OF ROSES WHETHER HE WAS A SHEPHERD OR A WARRIOR AND IF BY CHANCE ONE WAS A CAPTAIN OF DRAGOONS
5652-19215-0046 PEOPLE THOUGHT MUCH OF LOOKING WELL THEY EMBROIDERED AND TINTED THEMSELVES A BOURGEOIS HAD THE AIR OF A FLOWER A MARQUIS HAD THE AIR OF A PRECIOUS STONE PEOPLE HAD NO STRAPS TO THEIR BOOTS THEY HAD NO BOOTS
5652-19215-0047 THEY WERE SPRUCE SHINING WAVED LUSTROUS FLUTTERING DAINTY COQUETTISH WHICH DID NOT AT ALL PREVENT THEIR WEARING SWORDS BY THEIR SIDES THE HUMMING BIRD HAS BEAK AND CLAWS
5652-19215-0048 ONE OF THE SIDES OF THAT CENTURY WAS DELICATE THE OTHER WAS MAGNIFICENT AND BY THE GREEN CABBAGES PEOPLE AMUSED THEMSELVES TO DAY PEOPLE ARE SERIOUS THE BOURGEOIS IS AVARICIOUS THE BOURGEOISE IS A PRUDE
5652-19215-0049 YOUR CENTURY IS UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE WOULD DRIVE AWAY THE GRACES AS BEING TOO LOW IN THE NECK ALAS BEAUTY IS CONCEALED AS THOUGH IT WERE UGLINESS SINCE THE REVOLUTION
5652-19215-0050 EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE BALLET DANCERS HAS HAD ITS TROUSERS A MOUNTEBANK DANCER MUST BE GRAVE YOUR RIGADOONS ARE DOCTRINARIAN
5652-19215-0051 AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT ONE ARRIVES AT WITH THAT MAJESTY AT BEING PETTY LEARN THIS JOY IS NOT ONLY JOYOUS IT IS GREAT BUT BE IN LOVE GAYLY THEN
5652-19215-0052 WHAT THE DEUCE MARRY WHEN YOU MARRY WITH FEVER AND GIDDINESS AND TUMULT AND THE UPROAR OF HAPPINESS BE GRAVE IN CHURCH WELL AND GOOD BUT AS SOON AS THE MASS IS FINISHED
5652-19215-0053 YOU MUST MAKE A DREAM WHIRL AROUND THE BRIDE A MARRIAGE SHOULD BE ROYAL AND CHIMERICAL IT SHOULD PROMENADE ITS CEREMONY FROM THE CATHEDRAL OF RHEIMS TO THE PAGODA OF CHANTELOUP
5652-19215-0054 BE ONE OF THE GODS AH PEOPLE MIGHT BE SYLPHS GAMES AND LAUGHTER ARGIRASPIDES THEY ARE STUPIDS
5652-19215-0055 THE EMPYREAN WITH THE SWANS AND THE EAGLES EVEN IF YOU DO HAVE TO FALL BACK ON THE MORROW INTO THE BOURGEOISIE OF THE FROGS
5652-19215-0056 DO NOT PRUNE THEM OF THEIR SPLENDORS DON'T SCRIMP ON THE DAY WHEN YOU BEAM THE WEDDING IS NOT THE HOUSEKEEPING OH IF I WERE TO CARRY OUT MY FANCY IT WOULD BE GALLANT VIOLINS WOULD BE HEARD UNDER THE TREES
5652-19215-0057 RECEIVES NO IMPRESSIONS EITHER HUMAN OR PLEASANT OR PAINFUL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EARTHQUAKES AND CATASTROPHES THIS DEVOTION
5652-19215-0058 CORRESPONDS TO A COLD IN THE HEAD YOU SMELL NOTHING OF LIFE NEITHER ANY BAD NOR ANY GOOD ODOR MOREOVER THE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS HAD SETTLED THE ELDERLY SPINSTER'S INDECISION
5652-19215-0059 SOMEWHAT RESENTFUL IN HER INMOST SOUL
5652-19215-0060 SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT HIM POOR SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR MY NEPHEW HE IS WEDDING A BEGGAR LET HIM BE A BEGGAR HIMSELF BUT COSETTE'S HALF MILLION PLEASED THE AUNT AND ALTERED HER INWARD SITUATION SO FAR
5652-19215-0061 ONE OWES SOME CONSIDERATION TO SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SHE COULD NOT DO OTHERWISE THAN LEAVE HER FORTUNE TO THESE YOUNG PEOPLE SINCE THEY DID NOT NEED IT
5652-19215-0062 THE FINEST IN THE HOUSE THAT WILL MAKE ME YOUNG AGAIN HE SAID IT'S AN OLD PLAN OF MINE I HAVE ALWAYS ENTERTAINED THE IDEA OF HAVING A WEDDING IN MY CHAMBER
5652-39938-0000 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WORK OF THE PHYSICIAN DOES NOT BEGIN WITH HIS CURATIVE EFFORTS THERAPY IS ALWAYS ONLY THE LAST STEP DIAGNOSIS AND OBSERVATION HAVE TO PRECEDE AND AN INQUIRY INTO THE CAUSES OF THE DISEASE IS ESSENTIAL
5652-39938-0001 THE WHOLE EQUIPMENT OF THE MODERN LABORATORY OUGHT TO BE PUT AT ITS DISPOSAL PERCEPTIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS REACTIONS AND EXPRESSIONS OUGHT TO BE EXAMINED WITH THE SAME CAREFULNESS WITH WHICH THE CONSCIENTIOUS PHYSICIAN EXAMINES THE BLOOD AND THE URINE
5652-39938-0002 AND YET NO PSYCHICAL TREATMENT CAN START SUCCESSFULLY SO LONG AS THE PATIENT IS BROODING ON SECRET THOUGHTS AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS MIND THE DESIRE TO HIDE THEM MAY OFTEN BE ITSELF A PART OF THE DISEASE
5652-39938-0003 IT IS SURPRISING HOW OFTEN UNSUSPECTED VISTAS OF THOUGHTS AND IMPULSES AND EMOTIONS ARE OPENED BY AN INQUIRING ANALYSIS WHERE THE DIRECT REPORT OF THE PATIENT DOES NOT AWAKEN THE LEAST SUSPICION
5652-39938-0004 THE INTELLECTUAL CLEARNESS OF THE PATIENT TOO EASILY TEMPTS ONE INTO TRUSTING THE SINCERITY OF HIS STORY AND YET THE MOST IMPORTANT IDEAS CLUSTERING PERHAPS ABOUT LOVE OR AMBITION ABOUT VICE OR CRIME ABOUT BUSINESS FAILURE OR FAMILY SECRETS
5652-39938-0005 WITHHELD AND MAY FRUSTRATE EVERY PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC INFLUENCE WHERE SUSPICION IS AWAKE AND MERE CONFIDENTIAL TALK AND PERSUASION SEEM INSUFFICIENT
5652-39938-0006 THE PHYSICIAN MAY FEEL JUSTIFIED IN THE INTEREST OF HIS PATIENT IN DRAWING THE THOUGHTS OUT OF THEIR HIDING PLACE BY ARTIFICIAL MEANS SKILL TACT AND EXPERIENCE ARE NEEDED THERE AS A MATTER OF COURSE
5652-39938-0007 WILL SUPPORT THE PHYSICIAN AND ACCORDINGLY HIS EXAMINATION IS NOT OBLIGED TO TRAP THE PATIENT BUT SIMPLY TO GUIDE HIM TO IMPORTANT POINTS BUT THEN BEGINS THE MOST ESSENTIAL STUDY OF DIAGNOSTICAL DIFFERENTIATION
5652-39938-0008 WITH ALL THE MEANS NOT ONLY OF PSYCHOLOGY BUT OF NEUROLOGY AND INTERNAL MEDICINE HE HAS TO SEPARATE THE PARTICULAR CASE FROM SIMILAR ONES AND TO EXAMINE WHETHER HE DEALS WITH FOR INSTANCE A HYSTERIC OR WITH A PARANOIAC
5652-39938-0009 AND HE WILL NOT FORGET THAT THERE EXIST ALMOST NO SYMPTOMS OF SERIOUS DISEASES WHICH THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE HYSTERIC MAY NOT IMITATE FOR A TIME
5652-39938-0010 NOT OURS IS THE TASK OF ANALYZING SPECIAL METHODS OF NEUROLOGICAL AND MENTAL DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS SUCH AS ARE USED IN THE PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC AND IN THE OFFICE OF THE NERVE SPECIALIST THERE THE FAMILY HISTORY WITH REFERENCE TO NERVOUS AND OTHER DISEASES
5652-39938-0011 IN A SIMILAR WAY THE PSYCHICAL EXAMINATION TESTS THE HALLUCINATIONS AND ILLUSIONS THE VARIATIONS AND DEFECTS OF MEMORY AND ATTENTION OF JUDGMENT AND REASONING OF ORIENTATION AND SELF CONSCIOUSNESS OF EMOTIONS AND VOLITIONS
5652-39938-0012 BUT ONE RULE IS COMMON TO ALL OF THEM NEVER USE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC METHODS IN A SCHEMATIC WAY LIKE A RIGID PATTERN SCHEMATIC TREATMENT IS A POOR TREATMENT IN EVERY DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE BUT IN PSYCHOTHERAPEUTICS IT IS DISASTROUS
5652-39938-0013 THERE ARE NO TWO CASES ALIKE AND NOT ONLY THE EASILY RECOGNIZABLE DIFFERENCES OF SEX AND AGE AND OCCUPATION AND EDUCATION AND FINANCIAL MEANS AND TEMPERAMENT AND CAPACITY ARE DECISIVE
5652-39938-0014 BUT ALL THE SUBTLE VARIATIONS OF PREJUDICES AND BELIEFS PREFERENCES AND DISLIKES FAMILY LIFE AND SOCIAL SURROUNDINGS AMBITIONS AND PROSPECTS MEMORIES AND FANCIES
5652-39938-0015 EVERY ELEMENT OF A MAN'S LIFE HISTORY IMPRESSIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD HIS LOVE AND HIS SUCCESSES HIS DISEASES AND HIS DISTRESSES HIS ACQUAINTANCES AND HIS READING HIS TALENT HIS CHARACTER HIS SINCERITY HIS ENERGY HIS INTELLIGENCE
5652-39938-0016 EVERYTHING OUGHT TO DETERMINE THE CHOICE OF THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC STEPS AS IT IS ENTIRELY IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE ALL THOSE FACTORS BY ANY SUFFICIENT INQUIRY
5652-39938-0017 MOST OF THE ADJUSTMENT OF METHOD MUST BE LEFT TO THE INSTINCT OF THE PHYSICIAN IN WHICH WIDE EXPERIENCE SOLID KNOWLEDGE TACT AND SYMPATHY OUGHT TO BE BLENDED EVEN THE WAY IN WHICH THE PATIENT REACTS ON THE METHOD WILL OFTEN GUIDE THE INSTINCT OF THE WELL TRAINED PSYCHOTHERAPIST
5652-39938-0018 IT IS THEREFORE CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH THAT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PHYSICIAN SIMPLY DECIDE BEFOREHAND ON A DEFINITE COURSE OF PSYCHICAL TREATMENT AND LEAVE THE CARRYING OUT TO A WELL MEANING MINISTER OR ANY OTHER MEDICAL AMATEUR WHO SCHEMATICALLY FOLLOWS THE INDICATED PATH
5652-39938-0019 THE FINEST ADJUSTMENT HAS TO COME IN DURING THE TREATMENT ITSELF AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT OFTEN HAS TO SUGGEST ENTIRELY NEW LINES OF PROCEDURE
5652-39938-0020 MORE THAN IN ANY OTHER FIELD OF MEDICINE THE PHYSICIAN HIMSELF HAS TO EXTEND HIS INFLUENCE FAR BEYOND THE OFFICE HOURS AND THE STRICTLY MEDICAL RELATIONS AND YET ON THE OTHER HAND THERE IS NO DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE IN WHICH THE TREATMENT MIGHT NOT PROFIT BY THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC INFLUENCE
5652-39938-0021 SUBTLE ADJUSTMENT TO THE PERSONAL NEEDS AND TO THE INDIVIDUAL CONDITIONS IS NECESSARY IN EVERY CASE WHERE THE PSYCHICAL FACTOR IS TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE
5652-39938-0022 IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT THE ONE GREAT OBSTACLE IN THE WORK OF THE ROUTINE PHYSICIAN IS THE LACK OF TIME AND PATIENCE WHICH IS NEEDED FOR SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT TO PRESCRIBE DRUGS IS ALWAYS QUICKER THAN TO INFLUENCE THE MIND
5652-39938-0023 THE FIRST METHOD TO BRING BACK THE PSYCHOPHYSICAL EQUILIBRIUM
5652-39938-0024 NAMELY TO REMOVE THE EXTERNAL SOURCES OF THE DISTURBANCE EXTERNAL INDICATES THERE NOT ONLY THE OUTER WORLD BUT ALSO THE OWN BODY OUTSIDE THE CONSCIOUS PARTS OF THE BRAIN
5652-39938-0025 IF WE TAKE IT IN THE WIDEST MEANING THIS WOULD EVIDENTLY INCLUDE EVERY POSSIBLE MEDICAL TASK FROM FILLING A PAINFUL TOOTH TO OPERATING ON A PAINFUL APPENDIX AS IN EVERY CASE WHERE PAIN RESULTS THE MENTAL EQUILIBRIUM IS DISTURBED BY IT AND THE NORMAL MENTAL LIFE OF THE PATIENT REDUCED IN ITS EFFICIENCY
5652-39938-0026 GROWTHS IN THE NOSE MAY BE OPERATED UPON THE ASTIGMATIC OR THE SHORT SIGHTED EYE MAY BE CORRECTED BY GLASSES THE CHILD WHO IS HARD OF HEARING MAY AT LEAST BE SEATED NEAR THE TEACHER AND THE BACKWARD CHILDREN QUICKLY REACH THE AVERAGE LEVEL
5652-39938-0027 NO DOUBT IN THE LIFE OF THE ADULT AS WELL OFTEN ALMOST INSIGNIFICANT AND FROM A STRICTLY PHYSICAL POINT OF VIEW UNIMPORTANT ABNORMITIES IN THE BODILY SYSTEM
5652-39938-0028 ESPECIALLY IN THE DIGESTIVE AND SEXUAL SPHERES ARE SOURCES OF IRRITATION WHICH SLOWLY INFLUENCE THE WHOLE PERSONALITY
5652-39938-0029 TO BE SURE THE BRAIN DISTURBANCE MAY HAVE REACHED A POINT WHERE THE MERE REMOVAL OF THE ORIGINAL AFFLICTION IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO REINSTATE THE NORMAL BALANCE OF MENTAL ENERGIES BUT WHEREVER SUCH A BODILY IRRITATION GOES ON IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO ABOLISH IT IN THE INTERESTS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY
5652-39938-0030 HOWEVER OFTEN HE MAY GET THE IMPRESSION THAT SUCH A LIBERATION WOULD STOP THE SOURCE OF THE MENTAL TROUBLE
5652-39938-0031 OFTEN WITHIN A SURPRISINGLY SHORT TIME THE BRAIN GATHERS THE ENERGIES TO OVERCOME THE FRICTIONS WITH UNAVOIDABLE SURROUNDINGS YET HERE THE PHYSICIAN HAS TO ADJUST THE PRESCRIBED DOSE OF OUTING VERY CAREFULLY TO THE SPECIAL CASE
5652-39938-0032 WE MAY BE GUIDED BY THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE INTEREST OF TESTING THE FATIGUE INDUCED BY MENTAL WORK
5652-39938-0033 IF PERHAPS FOUR HOURS OF CONCENTRATED WORK ARE DONE WITHOUT PAUSES EXPERIMENT SHOWS THAT THE QUALITY OF THE WORK DETERIORATES MEASURED FOR INSTANCE BY THE NUMBER OF MISTAKES IN QUICK CALCULATION
5652-39938-0034 THE INSTINCT OF THE PHYSICIAN HAS TO FIND THE MIDDLE WAY BETWEEN A TEMPORARY REMOVAL OF IRRITATION WHICH REALLY ALLOWS A DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ENERGIES AND A MERE INTERRUPTION WHICH SIMPLY DAMAGES THE ACQUIRED RELATIVE ADJUSTMENT
5652-39938-0035 EVERY CAUSE OF FRICTION WHICH CAN BE PERMANENTLY ANNIHILATED FOR THE PATIENT CERTAINLY SHOULD BE REMOVED THIS NEGATIVE REMEDY DEMANDS ITS POSITIVE SUPPLEMENT
5652-39938-0036 THE PATIENT MUST BE BROUGHT UNDER CONDITIONS AND INFLUENCES WHICH GIVE FAIR CHANCES FOR THE RECUPERATION OF HIS ENERGIES TOO OFTEN FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE PSYCHOLOGIST THE PRESCRIPTION IS SIMPLY REST
5652-39938-0037 AS FAR AS REST INVOLVES SLEEP IT IS CERTAINLY THE IDEAL PRESCRIPTION THERE IS NO OTHER INFLUENCE WHICH BUILDS UP THE INJURED CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM AS SAFELY AS SOUND NATURAL SLEEP
5652-39938-0038 AND LOSS OF SLEEP IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST PERNICIOUS CONDITIONS FOR THE BRAIN AGAIN REST IS A GREAT FACTOR IN THOSE SYSTEMATIC REST CURES WHICH FOR A LONG WHILE WERE ALMOST THE FASHION WITH THE NEUROLOGIST
5652-39938-0039 IT IS SIMPLY MEANT THAT HE GIVE UP HIS FATIGUING DAILY WORK EVEN IF THAT WORK IS MADE UP OF A ROUND OF ENTERTAINMENTS AND CALLS AND SOCIAL ENGAGEMENTS THE NEURASTHENIC AND ALL SIMILAR VARIETIES ARE SENT AWAY FROM THE NOISE OF THE CITY AWAY FROM THE RUSH OF THEIR BUSY LIFE
5652-39938-0040 THE WILD CHASE FOR LUXURY IN THE HIGHER CLASSES REENFORCED BY THE COMMERCIALISM OF OUR TIME THE HARD AND MONOTONOUS LABOR IN OUR MODERN MILLS AND MINES FOR THE LOWER CLASSES
5652-39938-0041 THE OVER EXCITEMENT BROUGHT TO EVERYBODY BY THE SENSATIONALISM OF OUR NEWSPAPERS AND OF OUR PUBLIC LIFE ALL INJURE THE BRAIN CELLS AND DAMAGE THE EQUILIBRIUM
5652-39938-0042 THAT IS A STORY WHICH WE HEAR A THOUSAND TIMES NOWADAYS YET IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THERE IS REALLY MUCH TRUTH IN SUCH A CLAIM AND WHETHER MUCH WISE PSYCHOTHERAPY CAN BE DEDUCED FROM IT
5652-39938-0043 WE MAY BEGIN EVEN WITH THE VERY JUSTIFIABLE DOUBT WHETHER NERVOUSNESS REALLY HAS INCREASED IN OUR TIME EARLIER PERIODS HAD NOT SO MANY NAMES FOR THOSE SYMPTOMS AND WERE NOT ABLE TO DISCRIMINATE THEM WITH THE SAME CLEARNESS
5652-39938-0044 EVEN TODAY MOST PEOPLE ARE STILL WITHOUT SUSPICION THAT A NEURASTHENIC OR A PSYCHASTHENIC OR A HYSTERIC DISTURBANCE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM MAY BE IN ITS BEGINNING
5652-39938-0045 EARLIER TIMES SURELY MAY HAVE TREATED EVEN THE STRONGER VARIETIES OF THIS KIND AS TROUBLESOME VARIATIONS IN THE SPHERE OF THE NORMAL
5652-39938-0046 THE PROGRESS OF SCIENTIFIC HYGIENE HAS BROUGHT EVERYONE MUCH NEARER TO A HARMONIOUS FUNCTIONING OF THE ORGANISM AND THE PROGRESS OF TECHNIQUE HAS REMOVED INNUMERABLE DIFFICULTIES FROM THE PLAY OF LIFE
5652-39938-0047 OF COURSE WE STAND TODAY BEFORE A MUCH MORE COMPLEX SURROUNDING THAN OUR ANCESTORS BUT STILL MORE QUICKLY THAN THE COMPLEXITY HAVE GROWN THE MEANS TO MASTER IT
5652-39938-0048 THERE IS NO NATION ON EARTH WHICH IS MORE PROUD OF ITS RUSH AND ITS HURRY THAN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND YET WHAT AN
5652-39938-0049 MOREOVER OUR LIFE HAS PROBABLY BECOME COOLER THERE IS LESS EMOTIONALISM LESS SENTIMENTALITY MORE BUSINESS LIKE ATTITUDE AND THAT ALL MEANS LESS INNER FRICTION AND EXCITEMENT IN PUBLIC LIFE TOO LESS FEAR OF WAR AND LESS RELIGIOUS STRUGGLE
5652-39938-0050 ABOVE ALL THE INTENSITY OF MENTAL STIMULI IS ALWAYS RELATIVE THE PSYCHOLOGIST KNOWS THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH DETERMINE THAT WE PERCEIVE THE DIFFERENCE OF IMPRESSIONS AS ALIKE WHEN THE STIMULI ARE PROPORTIONAL
5652-39938-0051 IF I HAVE A TEN POUND WEIGHT IN ONE HAND I MAY FIND THAT I MUST HAVE ONE POUND MORE IN THE OTHER HAND TO DISCRIMINATE THE DIFFERENCE
5652-39938-0052 YET THAT QUIET COUNTRYMAN MAY REACT IN HIS NARROW SYSTEM NOT LESS WHEN THE MODEST CHANGES IN HIS SURROUNDINGS PROVOKE HIM THE GOSSIP OF HIS NEIGHBOR MAY UNDERMINE HIS NERVOUS SYSTEM JUST AS MUCH AS A POLITICAL FIGHT OR THE STRUGGLES OF THE EXCHANGE THAT OF THE CITY MAN
5652-39938-0053 EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE ESTIMATED WITH REFERENCE TO THE STANDARD OF THE PARTICULAR CASE THIS RELATIVITY OF THE MENTAL REACTION ON THE DEMANDS OF LIFE MUST ALWAYS BE IN THE FOREGROUND OF THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC REGIME
5652-39938-0054 SIMPLY TO WITHDRAW A PATIENT FROM THE ONE KIND OF LIFE
5652-39938-0055 COMPLETE REST FOR INSTANCE FOR A HARD BRAIN WORKER HARDLY OUGHT TO BE RECOMMENDED UNLESS A HIGH DEGREE OF EXHAUSTION HAS COME ON IF ROUTINE PRESCRIPTIONS ARE TO BE ADMITTED AT ALL
5652-39938-0056 THEY SHOULD NOT BE COMPLETE REST OR COMPLETE CHANGE OF LIFE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME BUT A CONTINUATION OF THE LIFE FOR WHICH ADJUSTMENT HAS BEEN LEARNED WITH A REASONABLE REDUCTION OF THE DEMANDS AND STIMULATIONS
5652-39938-0057 THE INTELLECTUAL WORKER OUGHT TO DECREASE HIS WORK THE OVERBUSY SOCIETY WOMAN OUGHT TO STAY IN BED ONE DAY IN THE WEEK THE MAN IN THE MIDST OF THE RUSH OF LIFE OUGHT TO CUT DOWN HIS OBLIGATIONS
5652-39938-0058 BUT PROBABLY EACH OF THEM DOES BETTER TO GO ON THAN SIMPLY TO SWEAR OFF ALTOGETHER THEIR REST OUGHT TO HAVE THE CHARACTER OF VACATION THAT MEANS INTERRUPTIONS WITHOUT THE USUAL ACTIVITY OUGHT TO BE SHORT PERIODS SPENT WITH THE DISTINCT FEELING
5652-39938-0059 THAT THEY ARE INTERRUPTIONS OF THAT WHICH MUST LAST AND THAT THEY ARE NOT THEMSELVES TO BECOME LASTING STATES
5652-39938-0060 STRENUOSITY MUST NOT MEAN AN EXTERNAL RUSH WITH THE GESTURES OF OVERBUSY EXCITEMENT BUT CERTAINLY THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAZY LIFE IS WRETCHED PSYCHOTHERAPY AS LONG AS NO SERIOUS ILLNESS IS IN QUESTION
5652-39938-0061 BY FAR THE BEST ALTERATION IS THEREFORE EVEN IN THE PERIODS OF INTERRUPTION NOT SIMPLY REST BUT NEW ENGAGEMENTS WHICH AWAKEN NEW INTERESTS AND STIMULATE NEGLECTED MENTAL FACTORS DISBURDENING THE OVER STRAINED ELEMENTS OF MENTAL LIFE
5652-39938-0062 THE MOST EFFECTIVE AGENCY FOR THIS TASK IS CONTACT WITH BEAUTY BEAUTY IN NATURE AND LIFE BEAUTY IN ART AND LITERATURE AND MUSIC
5652-39938-0063 TO ENJOY A LANDSCAPE OUGHT TO BE NOT MERELY A NEGATIVE REST FOR THE MAN OF THE OFFICE BUILDING AND GOOD LITERATURE OR MUSIC ABSORBS THE MENTAL ENERGIES AND HARMONIZES THEM
5652-39938-0064 IN THE SECOND PLACE COME GAMES AND SPORT WHICH MAY ENTER INTO THEIR RIGHT IF FATIGUE CAN BE AVOIDED HARMONIOUS JOYFUL COMPANY AS DIFFERENT AS POSSIBLE FROM THE DEPRESSING COMPANY OF THE SANITARIUMS WILL ADD ITS PLEASANTNESS
5652-39938-0065 WHILE THE ADVICE OF THE PHYSICIAN OUGHT THUS TO EMPHASIZE THE POSITIVE ELEMENTS WHICH WORK NOT TOWARDS REST BUT TOWARD A HARMONIOUS MENTAL ACTIVITY WE MUST NOT FORGET SOME ESSENTIAL NEGATIVE PRESCRIPTIONS
5652-39938-0066 EVERYTHING IS TO BE AVOIDED WHICH INTERFERES WITH THE NIGHT'S SLEEP
5688-15787-0000 THERE WERE THREE GOOD HOTELS SEVERAL STORES DRAPERS WATCHMAKER TAILORS SHOEMAKERS AND BUTCHERS AND BAKERS LOTS OF DIGGERS WERE RETURNING WHO HAD MADE THEIR PILE AND OTHERS GOING TO TRY TO MAKE THEIRS OF COURSE WE WERE AMONGST THE LATTER
5688-15787-0001 AFTER SUNDRY REFRESHMENTS WE WENT INTO COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER WHAT WAS TO BE DONE NEXT WE ALL AGREED THAT A DAY'S SPELL WOULD DO US A DEAL OF GOOD AND THAT WE SHOULD BE ALL THE BETTER PREPARED FOR GOLD DIGGING AFTERWARDS
5688-15787-0002 WE WERE THEN ONLY TWELVE OR FOURTEEN MILES FROM FOREST CREEK AND I PROPOSED LOOKING FOR FRESH LODGINGS AS THE HOUSE WE WERE STAYING AT WAS ANYTHING BUT RESPECTABLE THIS WAS AGREED TO AND WE SEARCHED AND WERE SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING GOOD BEDS
5688-15787-0003 FOOD AND LIQUORS AND PLENTY OF COMPANY THIS WILL DO SAID I WE MUST MAKE SOME MONEY HERE HOW SAID FIDDLER JIM THE SAME AS AT THE FOREST INN REPLIED I AT ANY RATE WE CAN BUT TRY SAID PLUMBER GEORGE

5688-15787-0007 I TOLD HER THAT AT THE FOREST INN THE LANDLORD FOUND US IN BOARD AND LODGING VERY WELL THEN SAID SHE I WILL DO THE SAME WHEN DO YOU PROPOSE TO COMMENCE TO NIGHT SAID I THEN SAID SHE I'LL TELL THE OSTLER TO LIGHT UP THE ROOM AND GET YOUR STAGE READY
5688-15787-0008 I HAD A NOBBLER AND RETURNED TO MY MATES AND FOUND THEM ASLEEP WAKE UP SAID I THERE'S BUSINESS TO BE DONE WHAT'S UP SAID FIDDLER JIM ANYTHING FRESH ASKED PLUMBER GEORGE YES SAID I TELLING THEM ALL ABOUT MY ARRANGEMENTS

5688-15787-0010 THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY WAS SPENT GOING ABOUT INFORMING THE INHABITANTS WHAT A TREAT WAS IN STORE FOR THEM YOU MUST KNOW THAT FIDDLER JIM AND MYSELF HAD BROUGHT WITH US AN OLD DRESS COAT EACH AND BLACK TROUSERS AND WHITE WAISTCOAT ALL THE WORSE FOR WEAR
5688-15787-0011 THESE AND MY COATS AND OTHER RAGS FOR CARICATURE BUSINESS AND THE FIDDLE COMPRISED OUR PROFESSIONAL STOCK IN TRADE
5688-15787-0012 PLUMBER GEORGE WAS AT THE DOOR TAKING THE TWO SHILLINGS WHICH I THOUGHT WAS LITTLE LESS THAN A ROBBERY BUT I HAD AGREED TO DO IT THEY COMMENCED THE SAME PROGRAMME AS AT THE FOREST INN AND ALL WENT OFF WELL THE INTERVAL AS BEFORE AND DRINKS ALL ROUND
5688-15787-0013 EVERYBODY WAS EAGER FOR THE DANCE OFF THEY WENT MISSUS HALLIDAY CAME IN SHE WAS A SCOTCH LASSIE AND COULDN'T KEEP HER FEET QUIET WHILE THE REEL OF TULLEGORAM WAS BEING PLAYED SHE RUSHED INTO THE ROOM AND BEGAN TO TWIST AND TWIRL ABOUT LIKE AN EEL TILL SHE NEARLY FAINTED
5688-15787-0014 WE THANKED THE COMPANY AND RETIRED TO OUR ROOM COUNTED THE CASH AND FOUND WE HAD TAKEN EIGHT POUNDS IT'S NOT BAD SAID FIDDLER JIM LET'S HAVE ANOTHER NOBBLER BEFORE WE GO TO BED SAID PLUMBER GEORGE ALL RIGHT REJOINED I
5688-15787-0015 HOME TO DINNER EVERYTHING GOING RIGHT RESTED IN THE AFTERNOON
5688-15787-0016 THE PLACE WAS NOT RUSHED THE SECOND NIGHT BUT WE NEVERTHELESS ADDED FOUR POUNDS MORE TO OUR TREASURY AFTER A GOOD NIGHT'S REST WE GOT UP AND PREPARED TO START
5688-15787-0017 WE HAD ABOUT TWELVE OR FOURTEEN MILES TO WALK TO THE GREAT FOREST DIGGINGS THAT HAD GIVEN ME THE FEVER IN LONDON WE STOPPED AT SAWPIT GULLY AND HAD A REST AND BEER SIX MILES MORE AND THEN WE SAW WHAT IS NOT EASILY FORGOTTEN
5688-15787-0018 WE ARRIVED SAFELY AT THE CREEK AND WERE ASTONISHED TO SEE THE NUMBER OF TENTS THE THOUSANDS AT WORK MEN WOMEN GIRLS AND BOYS OF ALL AGES AND THE DEEP HOLES NEARLY FRIGHTENED ME
5688-15787-0019 JOE JOE WHICH WAS RESPONDED TO ALL ROUND THE DIGGINGS IT WAS A SAYING OR CRY THEY HAD WHEN THE POLICE WENT ROUND TO EXAMINE THEIR LICENCES I AND MY PARTY WALKED ON TAKING OBSERVATIONS WHEN ALL AT ONCE SOME ONE CALLED OUT IS THAT YOU PLUMBER GEORGE
5688-15787-0020 YES SAID HE ALL THAT REMAINS OF ME SINCE I LEFT LONDON WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE DIGGINGS SAID MISTER POSTMAN

5688-15787-0026 THEN MISTER POSTMAN PROPOSED THAT WE SHOULD GO WITH HIM TO JOHNNY ALLSORT'S STORE AND GET SOME BEER WHILE THE DINNER WAS COOKING TO WHICH WE ALL AGREED
5688-15787-0027 WHERE WE THEN WERE WAS CALLED PENNYWEIGHT FLAT ON OUR RIGHT IS MOONLIGHT FLAT THEN OVER THERE IS LONG GULLY THAT HILL ON THE LEFT IS CALLED ADELAIDE HILL AND THE NEXT IS FRIAR'S CREEK THEN FURTHER ON IS CAMPBELL'S CREEK
5688-15787-0028 AND THEN COMES MURDER CREEK WHICH TAKES YOU ON TO TARRANGOWER
5688-15787-0029 WE WERE INTRODUCED TO JOHNNY AS NEW ARRIVALS HE HAD MADE HIS FORTUNE BY SELLING TO NEW CHUMS SUCH ARTICLES AS TENTS CRADLES BUCKETS TUBS AND FRYING PANS IN FACT HE COULD SUPPLY ANYTHING EXCEPT GOLD DUST WHICH HE BOUGHT OR EXCHANGED FOR TEA SUGAR OR GROG
5688-15787-0030 GOT BACK SAFELY AND ENJOYED OUR DINNER AFTER WHICH WE HAD A LONG YARN ABOUT DIGGING
5688-15787-0031 SOME NEIGHBOURS CAME IN AND JIM TURNED OUT HIS FIDDLE AND PLAYED A BIT AFTER WHICH WE HAD SOME GROG FIRED OFF OUR PISTOLS RELOADED THEM MADE UP THE FIRE AND THEN TURNED INTO OUR BLANKETS WITH OUR FIREARMS UNDER OUR PILLOWS
5688-15787-0032 I SLEPT WELL TILL DAYLIGHT WHEN I GOT UP AND MADE A FIRE PUT ON THE BILLY AND HAD BREAKFAST WE THEN GAVE JOHNNY ALLSORTS ANOTHER CALL ALL OF US GOING TOGETHER MISTER POSTMAN ACCOMPANIED US TO SEE THAT WE WERE NOT IMPOSED UPON
5688-15787-0033 JOHNNY GREETED US WITH HOW ARE YOU THIS MORNING WILL YOU TAKE A NOBBLER AFTER BUSINESS SAID I GOOD SAID MISTER POSTMAN NOW THEN SAID ALLSORTS WHAT IS THE FIRST THING A GOOD WARM TENT SAID FIDDLER TIM

5688-15787-0035 TOO MUCH SAID MISTER POSTMAN

5688-15787-0038 WE ARRANGED THAT PLUMBER GEORGE WAS TO BE COOK FOR THE FIRST WEEK AND THE FIRST THING THAT HE HAD TO DO WAS TO CHOP A TREE DOWN BUT FIDDLER JIM HOWEVER HAD TO HELP HIM I WENT OFF TO THE BUTCHER'S SHOP AND GOT CREDIT FOR A QUARTER OF MUTTON
5688-15787-0039 AND WHEN I GOT BACK THEY HAD LIGHTED A FIRE SO I FRIED SOME MUTTON BOILED SOME POTATOES AND HAD DINNER AFTER WHICH WE WENT INTO COMMITTEE WHAT'S THE FIRST THING TO BE DONE ASKED GEORGE WE MUST TAKE OUT OUR LICENCE BEFORE WE BEGIN TO DIG SAID JIM
5688-15787-0040 AH SAID I I FORGOT THAT WE SHALL HAVE TO PAY THREE POUNDS FOR IT
5688-15787-0041 I'LL TRY MY FRIEND MISTER POSTMAN SAID GEORGE HE DID SO AND GOT IT WE THEN TOOK A WALK TO THE COMMISSIONER'S TENT AND GOT OUR LICENCES AFTER WHICH WE HAD A GOOD LOOK OVER THE TOWNSHIP WHICH WAS CALLED CASTLEMAINE AND IS SO CALLED TO THIS DAY
5688-15787-0042 ITS ORIGINAL NAME HOWEVER WAS MOUNT ALEXANDER
5688-15787-0043 AS IT RAINED HEAVILY WE AGREED NOT TO START WORK UNTIL THE NEXT DAY SO WE RETURNED TO OUR TENT AND WROTE LETTERS INFORMING THE FOLKS AT HOME OF OUR SAFE ARRIVAL GOT TO WORK NEXT DAY AND TOOK IT IN TURNS ONE TO USE THE PICK AND THE OTHER THE SHOVEL
5688-15787-0044 WE GOT DOWN ABOUT FOUR FEET THE FIRST DAY AND WERE VERY TIRED OUR HANDS NOT BEING USED TO PICK AND SHOVEL WORK WERE VERY SORE THE NEXT DAY WE EXPECTED TO BOTTOM THE HOLE THE DIGGERS TOLD US THAT WE SHOULD STRIKE THE PIPE CLAY AT ABOUT SEVEN FEET
5688-15787-0045 THE DEEPER WE WENT THE LABOR OF GETTING THE STUFF TO THE SURFACE WAS INCREASED AS EVERY BIT HAD TO BE DRAWN UP IN BUCKETS THE THIRD DAY WE GOT TO THE PIPE CLAY UNDER WHICH WAS FOUND A SMALL DEPOSIT OF GRAVEL
5688-41232-0000 APPENDIX A THE INFLUENCE OF MENSTRUATION ON THE POSITION OF WOMEN A QUESTION OF HISTORICAL PSYCHOLOGY
5688-41232-0001 IN REGARD TO WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SPEAK WITH CERTAINTY BUT WE HERE STRIKE ON A FACTOR OF SUCH IMPORTANCE SUCH NEGLECTED IMPORTANCE FOR THE PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SEXUAL RELATIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN THAT IT CANNOT BE WHOLLY IGNORED
5688-41232-0002 AMONG THE NEGROES OF SURINAM A WOMAN MUST LIVE IN SOLITUDE DURING THE TIME OF HER PERIOD IT IS DANGEROUS FOR ANY MAN OR WOMAN TO APPROACH HER AND WHEN SHE SEES A PERSON COMING NEAR SHE CRIES OUT ANXIOUSLY
5688-41232-0003 I AM UNCLEAN I AM UNCLEAN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WE FIND TRACES OF THE CUSTOM OF WHICH THIS IS A TYPICAL EXAMPLE BUT WE MUST NOT TOO HASTILY ASSUME THAT THIS CUSTOM IS EVIDENCE OF THE INFERIOR POSITION OCCUPIED BY SEMI CIVILIZED WOMEN
5688-41232-0004 IT IS NECESSARY TO TAKE A BROAD VIEW NOT ONLY OF THE BELIEFS OF SEMI CIVILIZED MAN REGARDING MENSTRUATION
5688-41232-0005 HAVE BEEN CREDITED WITH SOME DESIGN SINISTER OR EROTIC ON WOMEN
5688-41232-0006 ALL THESE FIGURES ARE REPRODUCED BY PLOSS AND BARTELS EVEN IN MODERN EUROPE THE SAME IDEAS PREVAIL IN PORTUGAL ACCORDING TO REYS IT IS BELIEVED THAT DURING MENSTRUATION WOMEN ARE LIABLE TO BE BITTEN BY LIZARDS
5688-41232-0007 AND TO GUARD AGAINST THIS RISK THEY WEAR DRAWERS DURING THE PERIOD IN GERMANY AGAIN IT WAS BELIEVED UP TO THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AT LEAST
5688-41232-0008 TO BUILD UP THIS WORLD WIDE BELIEF REGARDING THE ORIGIN OF MENSTRUATION THIS PRIMITIVE THEORY OF THE ORIGIN OF MENSTRUATION PROBABLY BRINGS BEFORE US IN ITS EARLIEST SHAPE THE SPECIAL AND INTIMATE BOND WHICH HAS EVER BEEN HELD TO CONNECT WOMEN
5688-41232-0009 BY VIRTUE OF THE MENSTRUAL PROCESS WITH THE NATURAL OR SUPERNATURAL POWERS OF THE WORLD EVERYWHERE MENSTRUATING WOMEN ARE SUPPOSED TO BE POSSESSED BY SPIRITS AND CHARGED WITH MYSTERIOUS FORCES IT IS AT THIS POINT THAT A SERIOUS MISCONCEPTION
5688-41232-0010 AS A MATTER OF FACT HOWEVER THE SAVAGE RARELY DISCRIMINATES BETWEEN BAD AND GOOD SPIRITS EVERY SPIRIT MAY HAVE EITHER A BENEFICIAL OR MALIGNANT INFLUENCE
5688-41232-0011 THE IMPORTANCE OF RECOGNIZING THE SPECIAL SENSE IN WHICH THE WORD UNCLEAN IS USED IN THIS CONNECTION WAS CLEARLY POINTED OUT BY ROBERTSON SMITH IN THE CASE OF THE SEMITES
5688-41232-0012 IS NOT THE ORDINARY WORD FOR THINGS PHYSICALLY FOUL IT IS A RITUAL TERM AND CORRESPONDS EXACTLY TO THE IDEA OF TABOO THE IDEAS UNCLEAN AND HOLY SEEM TO US TO STAND IN POLAR OPPOSITION TO ONE ANOTHER
5688-41232-0013 BUT IT WAS NOT SO WITH THE SEMITES AMONG THE LATER JEWS THE HOLY BOOKS DEFILED THE HANDS OF THE READER AS CONTACT WITH AN IMPURE THING DID AMONG LUCIAN'S SYRIANS
5688-41232-0014 WELLHAUSEN HOWEVER DEALING WITH THE EARLY ARABIANS EXPRESSLY MENTIONS THAT IN PRE ISLAMIC DAYS CLEAN AND UNCLEAN WERE USED SOLELY WITH REFERENCE TO WOMEN IN AND OUT OF THE MENSTRUAL STATE
5688-41232-0015 AT A LATER DATE FRAZER DEVELOPED THIS ASPECT OF THE CONCEPTION OF TABOO AND SHOWED HOW IT OCCURS AMONG SAVAGE RACES GENERALLY HE POINTED OUT THAT THE CONCEPTIONS OF HOLINESS AND POLLUTION NOT HAVING YET BEEN DIFFERENTIATED
5688-41232-0016 WOMEN AT CHILDBIRTH AND DURING MENSTRUATION ARE ON THE SAME LEVEL AS DIVINE KINGS CHIEFS AND PRIESTS AND MUST OBSERVE THE SAME RULES OF CEREMONIAL PURITY TO SECLUDE SUCH PERSONS FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD SO THAT THE DREADED SPIRITUAL DANGER SHALL NOT SPREAD
5688-41232-0017 IS THE OBJECT OF THE TABOO WHICH FRAZER COMPARES TO AN ELECTRICAL INSULATOR TO PRESERVE THE SPIRITUAL FORCE WITH WHICH THESE PERSONS ARE CHARGED FROM SUFFERING OR INFLICTING HARM BY CONTACT WITH THE OUTER WORLD
5688-41232-0018 AFTER DESCRIBING THE PHENOMENA ESPECIALLY THE PROHIBITION TO TOUCH THE GROUND OR SEE THE SUN FOUND AMONG VARIOUS RACES FRAZER CONCLUDES
5688-41232-0019 THE OBJECT OF SECLUDING WOMEN AT MENSTRUATION IS TO NEUTRALIZE THE DANGEROUS INFLUENCES WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO EMANATE FROM THEM AT SUCH TIMES THE GENERAL EFFECT OF THESE RULES IS TO KEEP THE GIRL SUSPENDED SO TO SAY BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH
5688-41232-0020 WHETHER ENVELOPED IN HER HAMMOCK AND SLUNG UP TO THE ROOF AS IN SOUTH AMERICA OR ELEVATED ABOVE THE GROUND IN A DARK AND NARROW CAGE AS IN NEW ZEALAND SHE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE OUT OF THE WAY OF DOING MISCHIEF SINCE BEING SHUT OFF BOTH FROM THE EARTH AND FROM THE SUN
5688-41232-0021 THE PRECAUTIONS THUS TAKEN TO ISOLATE OR INSULATE THE GIRL ARE DICTATED BY REGARD FOR HER OWN SAFETY AS WELL AS FOR THE SAFETY OF OTHERS IN SHORT THE GIRL IS VIEWED AS CHARGED WITH A POWERFUL FORCE WHICH IF NOT KEPT WITHIN BOUNDS
5688-41232-0022 MAY PROVE THE DESTRUCTION BOTH OF THE GIRL HERSELF AND OF ALL WITH WHOM SHE COMES IN CONTACT TO REPRESS THIS FORCE WITHIN THE LIMITS NECESSARY FOR THE SAFETY OF ALL CONCERNED IS THE OBJECT OF THE TABOOS IN QUESTION
5688-41232-0023 THE SAME EXPLANATION APPLIES TO THE OBSERVANCE OF THE SAME RULES BY DIVINE KINGS AND PRIESTS
5688-41232-0024 AND ARGUING THAT IT PROCEEDS FROM THE CUSTOM OF EXOGAMY OR MARRIAGE OUTSIDE THE CLAN AND THAT THIS RESTS ON CERTAIN IDEAS ABOUT BLOOD WHICH AGAIN ARE TRACEABLE TO TOTEMISM A THEORY WHICH WE NEED NOT HERE DISCUSS
5688-41232-0025 DURKHEIM IS BROUGHT FACE TO FACE WITH THE GROUP OF CONCEPTIONS THAT NOW CONCERN US HE INSISTS ON THE EXTREME AMBIGUITY FOUND IN PRIMITIVE CULTURE CONCERNING THE NOTION OF THE DIVINE AND THE CLOSE CONNECTION BETWEEN AVERSION AND VENERATION
5688-41232-0026 AND POINTS OUT THAT IT IS NOT ONLY AT PUBERTY AND EACH RECURRENCE OF THE MENSTRUAL EPOCH THAT WOMEN HAVE AROUSED THESE EMOTIONS BUT ALSO AT CHILDBIRTH A SENTIMENT OF RELIGIOUS HORROR HE CONTINUES
5688-41232-0027 WHICH CAN REACH SUCH A DEGREE OF INTENSITY WHICH CAN BE CALLED FORTH BY SO MANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND REAPPEARS REGULARLY EVERY MONTH TO LAST FOR A WEEK AT LEAST CANNOT FAIL TO EXTEND ITS INFLUENCE BEYOND THE PERIODS TO WHICH IT WAS ORIGINALLY CONFINED
5688-41232-0028 AND TO AFFECT THE WHOLE COURSE OF LIFE A BEING WHO MUST BE SECLUDED OR AVOIDED FOR WEEKS MONTHS OR YEARS PRESERVES SOMETHING OF THE CHARACTERISTICS TO WHICH THE ISOLATION WAS DUE EVEN OUTSIDE THOSE SPECIAL PERIODS
5688-41232-0029 AND IN FACT IN THESE COMMUNITIES THE SEPARATION OF THE SEXES IS NOT MERELY INTERMITTENT IT HAS BECOME CHRONIC THE TWO ELEMENTS OF THE POPULATION LIVE SEPARATELY
5688-41232-0030 DURKHEIM PROCEEDS TO ARGUE THAT THE ORIGIN OF THE OCCULT POWERS ATTRIBUTED TO THE FEMININE ORGANISM IS TO BE FOUND IN PRIMITIVE IDEAS CONCERNING BLOOD NOT ONLY MENSTRUAL BLOOD BUT ANY KIND OF BLOOD IS THE OBJECT OF SUCH FEELINGS AMONG SAVAGE AND BARBAROUS PEOPLES
5688-41232-0031 THE PROHIBITION TO DRINK WINE THE BLOOD OF THE GRAPE FOUND AMONG SOME PEOPLES IS TRACED TO ITS RESEMBLANCE TO BLOOD AND TO ITS SACRIFICIAL EMPLOYMENT AS AMONG THE ANCIENT ARABIANS AND STILL IN THE CHRISTIAN SACRAMENT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR DRINKING BLOOD
5688-41232-0032 THROUGHOUT BLOOD IS GENERALLY TABOO AND IT TABOOS EVERYTHING THAT COMES IN CONTACT WITH IT NOW WOMAN IS CHRONICALLY THE THEATRE OF BLOODY MANIFESTATIONS AND THEREFORE SHE TENDS TO BECOME CHRONICALLY TABOO FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY
5688-41232-0033 A MORE OR LESS CONSCIOUS ANXIETY A CERTAIN RELIGIOUS FEAR CANNOT FAIL TO ENTER INTO ALL THE RELATIONS OF HER COMPANIONS WITH HER AND THAT IS WHY ALL SUCH RELATIONS ARE REDUCED TO A MINIMUM RELATIONS OF A SEXUAL CHARACTER ARE SPECIALLY EXCLUDED
5688-41232-0034 IN THE FIRST PLACE SUCH RELATIONS ARE SO INTIMATE THAT THEY ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE SORT OF REPULSION WHICH THE SEXES MUST EXPERIENCE FOR EACH OTHER THE BARRIER BETWEEN THEM DOES NOT PERMIT OF SUCH A CLOSE UNION IN THE SECOND PLACE THE ORGANS OF THE BODY HERE SPECIALLY CONCERNED
5688-41232-0035 ARE PRECISELY THE SOURCE OF THE DREADED MANIFESTATIONS THUS IT IS NATURAL THAT THE FEELINGS OF AVERSION INSPIRED BY WOMEN ATTAIN THEIR GREATEST INTENSITY AT THIS POINT
5688-41232-0036 IN ANY CASE INDEED THE SAME IDEAS BEING TRANSFERRED TO WOMEN ALSO COITUS PRODUCES WEAKNESS AND IT PREVENTS THE ACQUISITION OF SUPERNATURAL POWERS THUS AMONG THE WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA BOAS STATES
5688-41232-0037 ONLY A YOUTH WHO HAS NEVER TOUCHED A WOMAN OR A VIRGIN
5688-41232-0038 AFTER HAVING HAD SEXUAL INTERCOURSE MEN AS WELL AS WOMEN
5688-41232-0039 YET THE TWOFOLD INFLUENCE OF THE MENSTRUATING WOMAN REMAINS CLEAR WHEN WE REVIEW THE WHOLE GROUP OF INFLUENCES WHICH IN THIS STATE SHE IS SUPPOSED TO EXERT SHE BY NO MEANS ACTS ONLY BY PARALYZING SOCIAL ACTIVITIES AND DESTROYING THE POWERS OF LIFE
5688-41232-0040 OH MENSTRUATING WOMAN THOU'RT A FIEND FROM WHOM ALL NATURE SHOULD BE CLOSELY SCREENED HER POWERS ARE ALSO BENEFICIAL
5688-41232-0041 IS IN REGULAR COMMUNICATION WITH THE STARRY BODIES
5688-41232-0042 IN OUR OWN TIME THE SLOW DISINTEGRATION OF PRIMITIVE ANIMISTIC CONCEPTIONS AIDED CERTAINLY BY THE DEGRADED CONCEPTION OF SEXUAL PHENOMENA TAUGHT BY MEDIAEVAL MONKS FOR WHOM WOMAN WAS TEMPLUM AEDIFICATUM SUPER CLOACAM
5688-41232-0043 HAS LED TO A DISBELIEF IN THE MORE SALUTARY INFLUENCES OF THE MENSTRUATING WOMAN A FAIRLY WIDESPREAD FAITH IN HER PERNICIOUS INFLUENCE ALONE SURVIVES IT MAY BE TRACED EVEN IN PRACTICAL AND COMMERCIAL ONE MIGHT ADD MEDICAL QUARTERS
5688-41232-0044 IN THE GREAT SUGAR REFINERIES IN THE NORTH OF FRANCE THE REGULATIONS STRICTLY FORBID A WOMAN TO ENTER THE FACTORY WHILE THE SUGAR IS BOILING OR COOLING THE REASON GIVEN BEING THAT IF A WOMAN WERE TO ENTER DURING HER PERIOD THE SUGAR WOULD BLACKEN
5688-41232-0045 FOR THE SAME REASON TO TURN TO THE EAST NO WOMAN IS EMPLOYED IN THE OPIUM MANUFACTORY AT SAIGON IT BEING SAID THAT THE OPIUM WOULD TURN AND BECOME BITTER
5688-41232-0046 DECLARED THAT ONE OF THE WOMEN WORKERS MUST BE MENSTRUATING ALL THE WOMEN HINDUS MAHOMETANS ABORIGINAL GONDS ET CETERA SHOWED BY THEIR ENERGETIC DENIALS THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THIS SUPERSTITION
5688-41232-0047 ASKING WHETHER IT WAS TRUE THAT IF A WOMAN CURED HAMS WHILE MENSTRUATING THE HAMS WOULD BE SPOILED HE HAD KNOWN THIS TO HAPPEN TWICE ANOTHER MEDICAL MAN WROTE THAT IF SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE PATIENTS OF MENSTRUATING LADY DOCTORS
5688-41232-0048 A THIRD WROTE IN THE JOURNAL FOR APRIL TWENTY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT I THOUGHT THE FACT WAS SO GENERALLY KNOWN TO EVERY HOUSEWIFE AND COOK THAT MEAT WOULD SPOIL IF SALTED AT THE MENSTRUAL PERIOD THAT I AM SURPRISED TO SEE SO MANY LETTERS ON THE SUBJECT IN THE JOURNAL
5688-41232-0049 IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE FACT THAT MEAT WILL BE TAINTED IF CURED BY WOMEN AT THE CATAMENIAL PERIOD
5688-41232-0050 HAVE THOUGHT AND TAUGHT THAT THE PRESENCE OF A MENSTRUATING WOMAN WOULD POLLUTE SOLEMN RELIGIOUS RITES WOULD SOUR MILK SPOIL THE FERMENTATION IN WINE VATS AND MUCH OTHER MISCHIEF IN A GENERAL WAY INFLUENCED BY HOARY TRADITION
5688-41232-0051 BUT WHY THIS DELAY IF TIME IS PRECIOUS AND IT ENTERS AS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE CASE
5688-41232-0052 FOR BEING SWOLLEN THEN BY THE AFFLUX OF BLOOD
5688-41232-0053 THAN BY CURETTING THE WOMB DURING THE VERY FLOW WHILE I DO NOT SELECT THIS PERIOD FOR THE REMOVAL OF OVARIAN CYSTS OR FOR OTHER ABDOMINAL WORK SUCH AS THE EXTIRPATION OF THE OVARIES OR A KIDNEY OR BREAKING UP INTESTINAL ADHESIONS ET CETERA
5688-41232-0054 YET I HAVE NOT HESITATED TO PERFORM THESE OPERATIONS AT SUCH A TIME AND HAVE NEVER HAD REASON TO REGRET THE COURSE THE ONLY OPERATIONS THAT I SHOULD DISLIKE TO PERFORM DURING MENSTRUATION WOULD BE THOSE INVOLVING THE WOMB ITSELF
5688-41232-0055 IT MUST BE ADDED TO THIS THAT WE STILL HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION NOT MERELY THE SURVIVING INFLUENCE OF ANCIENT PRIMITIVE BELIEFS BUT THE POSSIBLE EXISTENCE OF ACTUAL NERVOUS CONDITIONS DURING THE MENSTRUAL PERIOD
5688-41232-0056 PRODUCING WHAT MAY BE DESCRIBED AS AN ABNORMAL NERVOUS TENSION IN THIS WAY WE ARE DOUBTLESS CONCERNED WITH A TISSUE OF PHENOMENA INEXTRICABLY WOVEN OF FOLK LORE AUTOSUGGESTION FALSE OBSERVATION
5688-41232-0057 THUS HE SPEAKS OF TWO YOUNG GIRLS OF ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN SLIGHTLY NEUROPATHIC BUT WITHOUT DEFINITE HYSTERICAL SYMPTOMS WHO DURING THE MENSTRUAL PERIOD FEEL THEMSELVES IN A SORT OF ELECTRICAL STATE
5688-41232-0058 WITH TINGLING AND PRICKLING SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS OF ATTRACTION OR REPULSION AT THE CONTACT OF VARIOUS OBJECTS THESE GIRLS BELIEVE THEIR GARMENTS STICK TO THEIR SKIN DURING THE PERIODS IT WAS ONLY WITH DIFFICULTY THAT THEY COULD REMOVE THEIR SLIPPERS THOUGH FITTING EASILY
5688-41232-0059 STOCKINGS HAD TO BE DRAWN OFF VIOLENTLY BY ANOTHER PERSON
5688-41232-0060 AN ORCHESTRAL PERFORMER ON THE DOUBLE BASS INFORMED LAURENT THAT WHENEVER HE LEFT A TUNED DOUBLE BASS IN HIS LODGINGS DURING HIS WIFE'S PERIOD A STRING SNAPPED CONSEQUENTLY HE ALWAYS REMOVED HIS INSTRUMENT AT THIS TIME TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE
5688-41232-0061 HE ADDED THAT THE SAME THING HAPPENED TWO YEARS EARLIER WITH A MISTRESS A CAFE CONCERT SINGER WHO HAD INDEED WARNED HIM BEFOREHAND A HARPIST ALSO INFORMED LAURENT THAT SHE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO GIVE UP HER PROFESSION
5688-41232-0062 BECAUSE DURING HER PERIODS SEVERAL STRINGS OF HER HARP ALWAYS THE SAME STRINGS BROKE ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE WAS PLAYING A FRIEND OF LAURENT'S AN OFFICIAL IN COCHIN CHINA ALSO TOLD HIM THAT THE STRINGS OF HIS VIOLIN OFTEN SNAPPED DURING THE MENSTRUAL PERIODS OF HIS ANNAMITE MISTRESS
5688-41232-0063 AND ARE CAREFUL NOT TO PLAY ON THEIR INSTRUMENTS AT THIS TIME TWO YOUNG LADIES BOTH GOOD VIOLINISTS ALSO AFFIRMED THAT EVER SINCE THEIR FIRST MENSTRUATION THEY HAD NOTED A TENDENCY FOR THE STRINGS TO SNAP AT THIS PERIOD
5688-41232-0064 ONE A GENUINE ARTIST WHO OFTEN PERFORMED AT CHARITY CONCERTS SYSTEMATICALLY REFUSED TO PLAY AT THESE TIMES AND WAS OFTEN EMBARRASSED TO FIND A PRETEXT THE OTHER WHO ADMITTED THAT SHE WAS NERVOUS AND IRRITABLE AT SUCH TIMES
5688-41232-0065 HAD GIVEN UP PLAYING ON ACCOUNT OF THE TROUBLE OF CHANGING THE STRINGS SO FREQUENTLY LAURENT ALSO REFERS TO THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH WOMEN BREAK THINGS DURING THE MENSTRUAL PERIODS AND CONSIDERS THAT THIS IS NOT SIMPLY DUE TO THE AWKWARDNESS CAUSED BY NERVOUS EXHAUSTION OR HYSTERICAL TREMORS
5688-41232-0066 BUT THAT THERE IS SPONTANEOUS BREAKAGE MOST USUALLY IT HAPPENS THAT A GLASS BREAKS WHEN IT IS BEING DRIED WITH A CLOTH NEEDLES ALSO BREAK WITH UNUSUAL FACILITY AT THIS TIME CLOCKS ARE STOPPED BY MERELY PLACING THE HAND UPON THEM
5688-41232-0067 I DO NOT HERE ATTEMPT TO ESTIMATE CRITICALLY THE VALIDITY OF THESE ALLEGED MANIFESTATIONS SOME OF WHICH MAY CERTAINLY BE EXPLAINED BY THE UNCONSCIOUS MUSCULAR ACTION WHICH FORMS THE BASIS OF THE PHENOMENA OF TABLE TURNING AND THOUGHT READING
5688-41232-0068 SUCH A TASK MAY BEST BE UNDERTAKEN THROUGH THE MINUTE STUDY OF ISOLATED CASES AND IN THIS PLACE I AM MERELY CONCERNED WITH THE GENERAL INFLUENCE OF THE MENSTRUAL STATE
5688-41232-0069 IN AFFECTING THE SOCIAL POSITION OF WOMEN WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE ELEMENTS THAT GO TO MAKE UP THAT INFLUENCE THERE IS ONLY ONE FURTHER POINT TO WHICH ATTENTION MAY BE CALLED
5688-41232-0070 I ALLUDE TO THE WAY IN WHICH THE MORE FAVORABLE SIDE OF THE PRIMITIVE CONCEPTION OF THE MENSTRUATING WOMAN AS PRIESTESS SIBYL PROPHETESS AN ALMOST MIRACULOUS AGENT FOR GOOD AN ANGEL THE PECULIAR HOME OF THE DIVINE ELEMENT
5688-41232-0071 THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL PHENOMENA OF MENSTRUATION WITH THE IDEAS OF TABOO ASSOCIATED WITH THAT STATE SANK INTO THE BACKGROUND AS CULTURE EVOLVED BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE IDEAS OF THE ANGELIC POSITION AND SPIRITUAL MISSION OF WOMEN
5688-41232-0072 THE MORE FAVORABLE ASPECT OF THE PRIMITIVE VIEW OF WOMEN'S MAGIC FUNCTION HAS NEVER QUITE DIED OUT THE GRADUAL DECAY AND DEGRADATION OF THE PRIMITIVE VIEW HAS ON THE WHOLE INVOLVED A LOWER ESTIMATE OF WOMEN'S NATURE AND POSITION
5688-41232-0073 WOMAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE WITCH SHE WAS SO EVEN IN ANCIENT BABYLONIA BUT SHE HAS CEASED TO BE THE PRIESTESS THE EARLY TEUTONS SAW SANCTUM ALIQUID ET PROVIDUM IN WOMEN WHO FOR THE MEDIAEVAL GERMAN PREACHER
5688-41232-0074 AND SCHOPENHAUER AND EVEN NIETZSCHE HAVE BEEN MORE INCLINED TO SIDE WITH THE PREACHER THAN WITH THE HALF NAKED PHILOSOPHERS OF TACITUS'S DAY BUT BOTH VIEWS ALIKE ARE BUT THE EXTREMES OF THE SAME PRIMITIVE CONCEPTION
5688-41232-0075 AND THE GRADUAL EVOLUTION FROM ONE EXTREME OF THE MAGICAL DOCTRINE TO THE OTHER WAS INEVITABLE IN AN ADVANCED CIVILIZATION AS WE SEE THESE IDEAS HAVING THEIR ULTIMATE BASIS ON THE OLD STORY OF THE SERPENT
5688-41232-0076 AND ON A SPECIAL AND MYSTERIOUS CONNECTION BETWEEN THE MENSTRUATING WOMAN AND THE OCCULT FORCES OF MAGIC TEND TO DIE OUT THE SEPARATION OF THE SEXES THEY INVOLVE BECOMES UNNECESSARY LIVING IN GREATER COMMUNITY WITH MEN
5703-47198-0000 ONE HOT SUMMER DAY A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE MARRIAGE JULIET RETURNING TO THE CONSULATE AFTER A MORNING SPENT IN VERY ACTIVE EXERCISE UPON A TENNIS COURT WAS MET ON THE DOORSTEP BY DORA THE YOUNGEST OF THE CLARENCY BUTCHERS

5703-47198-0006 SHE MIGHT EVEN HAVE GONE FURTHER AND SAID THAT SHE HAD NEVER HAD A LETTER FROM ENGLAND EXCEPT WHILE SIR ARTHUR WAS THERE ON LEAVE IT WAS A LARGE ENVELOPE ADDRESSED IN A CLERK'S HANDWRITING AND SHE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION AS SHE TORE IT OPEN
5703-47198-0007 THAT IT MUST BE AN ADVERTISEMENT FROM SOME SHOP DEAR MADAM WE SHALL ESTEEM IT A FAVOUR IF YOU CAN MAKE IT CONVENIENT TO CALL UPON US ONE DAY NEXT WEEK UPON A MATTER OF BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY
5703-47198-0008 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE YOU FURTHER DETAILS IN A LETTER BUT IF YOU WILL GRANT US THE INTERVIEW WE VENTURE TO ASK

5703-47198-0010 SOLICITORS THE ADDRESS WAS A STREET IN HOLBORN JULIET READ THE LETTER THROUGH AND STRAIGHTWAY READ IT THROUGH AGAIN WITH A BEATING HEART WHAT DID IT MEAN WAS IT POSSIBLE SHE WAS GOING TO FIND HER OWN FAMILY AT LAST
5703-47198-0011 SHE WAS RECALLED TO THE PRESENT BY THE VOICE OF DORA WHOM SHE NOW PERCEIVED TO BE READING THE LETTER OVER HER SHOULDER WITH UNBLUSHING INTEREST SAY SAID DORA ISN'T IT EXCITING SOMETHING TO YOUR ADVANTAGE

5703-47198-0015 DO YOU SUPPOSE I'M MADE OF CAST IRON SHE DEPARTED WITH AN INJURED AIR AND JULIET WENT TO LOOK FOR THE CONSUL WHAT IS IT HE ASKED AS SHE PUT THE ENVELOPE INTO HIS HAND A LETTER YOU WANT ME TO READ NOT A PROPOSAL EH
5703-47198-0016 HULLO WHAT'S THIS HE READ IT THROUGH CAREFULLY WHY JULIET HE SAID WHEN HE HAD FINISHED THIS IS VERY INTERESTING ISN'T IT IT LOOKS AS IF YOU WERE GOING TO FIND OUT SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF DOESN'T IT
5703-47198-0017 AFTER ALL THESE YEARS WELL WELL YOU THINK I MUST GO THEN SHE SAID A LITTLE DOUBTFULLY GO OF COURSE I SHOULD GO IF I WERE YOU WHY NOT
5703-47198-0018 NO NO I SEE NO REASON TO SUPPOSE SUCH A THING I KNOW THE FIRM OF FINDLAY AND INCE QUITE WELL BY NAME AND REPUTATION OH I HOPE THEY WILL TELL ME WHO I AM CRIED JULIET HAVE YOU NO IDEA AT ALL FATHER
5703-47198-0019 NO MY DEAR YOU KNOW I HAVE NOT BESIDES I PROMISED LENA I WOULD NEVER ASK YOU ARE THE CHILD OF A FRIEND OF HERS THAT IS ALL I KNOW I THINK SHE SCARCELY REALIZED HOW HARD IT WOULD BE FOR YOU NOT TO KNOW MORE WHEN YOU GREW UP
5703-47198-0020 I OFTEN THINK THAT IF SHE HAD LIVED SHE WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU BEFORE NOW IF YOU PROMISED HER NOT TO ASK I WON'T ASK EITHER SAID JULIET LOYALLY BUT I HOPE THEY'LL TELL ME IT WILL BE DIFFERENT WON'T IT IF THEY TELL ME WITHOUT MY ASKING
5703-47198-0021 I THINK YOU MIGHT ASK SAID SIR ARTHUR IT IS ABSURD THAT YOU SHOULD BE BOUND BY A PROMISE THAT I MADE AND YOU MAY BE SURE OF ONE THING YOUR ASKING OR YOUR NOT ASKING WON'T MAKE ANY ODDS TO FINDLAY AND INCE
5703-47198-0022 IF THEY MEAN TO TELL YOU THEY WILL AND IF THEY DON'T YOU'RE NOT LIKELY TO GET IT OUT OF THEM AND WHEN SHALL I GO CRIED JULIET THEY SAY THEY WANT ME TO ANSWER IMMEDIATELY YOU KNOW OH WELL I DON'T KNOW
5703-47198-0023 IN A FEW DAYS YOU WILL HARDLY BE READY TO START TO MORROW WILL YOU I COULD BE READY EASILY SAID JULIET YOU'RE IN A GREAT HURRY TO GET AWAY FROM US SAID SIR ARTHUR WITH A RATHER UNEASY LAUGH NOT FROM YOU
5703-47198-0024 JULIET PUT HER ARM THROUGH HIS I COULD NEVER FIND ANOTHER FATHER HALF AS NICE AS THE ONE I'VE GOT BUT YOU COULD DO VERY WELL WITHOUT SO MANY DAUGHTERS YOU KNOW SHE SMILED AT HIM MOCKINGLY YOU'RE LIKE THE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE
5703-47198-0025 YOU OUGHT TO SET UP A SCHOOL FOR YOUNG LADIES I DON'T BELIEVE I SHALL BE ABLE TO GET ON WITHOUT MY ELDEST DAUGHTER HE REPLIED HALF SERIOUS STILL I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR YOU IF YOUR REAL PARENTS HAVE DECIDED TO OWN UP TO YOU
5703-47198-0026 AT ALL EVENTS IF THEY DO NOT TURN OUT DESIRABLE I SHALL STILL BE HERE I HOPE SO I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN LOSE ANYTHING BY TAKING THIS CHANCE OF FINDING OUT WHAT YOU CAN ABOUT THEM AT THIS POINT LADY BYRNE CAME INTO THE ROOM
5703-47198-0027 THE LETTER WAS PRODUCED AGAIN AND SHE JOINED HEARTILY IN THE EXCITEMENT IT HAD CAUSED YOU HAD BETTER START ON MONDAY SHE SAID TO JULIET THAT WILL GIVE YOU TWO DAYS TO PACK
5703-47198-0028 ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE HER ARTHUR SHE ADDED TURNING TO HER HUSBAND I WOULD LIKE A SHOT HE REPLIED BUT I CAN'T POSSIBLY GET AWAY NEXT WEEK I'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK ON HAND JUST NOW I SUPPOSE MY DEAR HE SUGGESTED DOUBTFULLY
5703-47198-0029 THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO RUN OVER WITH HER LADY BYRNE DECLARED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO DO SO SHE HAD ENGAGEMENTS SHE SAID FOR EVERY DAY OF THE FOLLOWING WEEK WHICH IT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION TO BREAK
5703-47198-0030 HAD SIR ARTHUR FORGOTTEN THAT THEY THEMSELVES WERE HAVING LARGE DINNER PARTIES ON TUESDAY AND FRIDAY WHAT SHE WOULD DO WITHOUT JULIET TO HELP HER IN PREPARING FOR THEM SHE DID NOT KNOW
5703-47198-0031 BUT AT LEAST IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT SOME ONE MUST BE THERE TO RECEIVE HIS GUESTS NO JULIET WOULD HAVE TO GO ALONE SHE WAS REALLY OLD ENOUGH TO BE TRUSTED BY HERSELF FOR THREE DAYS AND THERE WAS NO NEED THAT SHE COULD SEE
5703-47198-0032 SHE CAN GO ON MONDAY SEE THE LAWYERS ON TUESDAY AND COME BACK ON WEDNESDAY SAID LADY BYRNE THE HELPLESSNESS OF YOUNG GIRLS IS THE ONE THING I DISAPPROVE OF IN YOUR EUROPEAN SYSTEM OF EDUCATION
5703-47198-0033 SUPPOSING SHE IS DETAINED IN LONDON HE SAID WHAT SHOULD DETAIN HER DEMANDED HIS WIFE UNLESS IT IS THE DISCOVERY OF HER PARENTS AND IF SHE FINDS THEM I PRESUME THEY WILL BE CAPABLE OF LOOKING AFTER HER IN ANY CASE
5703-47198-0034 SHE CAN WRITE OR CABLE TO US WHEN SHE HAS SEEN THE SOLICITORS AND IT IS NO USE PROVIDING FOR CONTINGENCIES THAT WILL PROBABLY NEVER ARISE
5703-47198-0035 A LETTER WAS WRITTEN AND DISPATCHED TO MESSRS FINDLAY AND INCE SAYING THAT MISS BYRNE WOULD HAVE PLEASURE IN CALLING UPON THEM AT TWELVE O'CLOCK ON THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY AND JULIET BUSIED HERSELF IN PREPARATIONS FOR HER JOURNEY
5703-47198-0036 ON MONDAY MORNING SHE LEFT OSTEND IN THE COMPANY OF HER MAID IT WAS A GLORIOUS AUGUST DAY ON SHORE THE HEAT WAS INTENSE AND IT WAS A RELIEF TO GET OUT OF THE STIFLING CARRIAGES OF THE CROWDED BOAT TRAIN
5703-47198-0037 AND TO BREATHE THE GENTLE AIR FROM THE SEA THAT MET THEM AS THEY CROSSED THE GANGWAY ON TO THE STEAMER JULIET ENJOYED EVERY MOMENT OF THE JOURNEY AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY WHEN THE CROSSING WAS OVER IF SHE HAD NOT BEEN SO EAGER TO SET FOOT UPON HER NATIVE SOIL
5703-47198-0038 SHE LEANT UPON THE RAIL IN THE BOWS OF THE SHIP WATCHING THE WHITE CLIFFS GROW TALLER AND MORE DISTINCT AND FELT THAT NOW INDEED SHE UNDERSTOOD THE EMOTIONS
5703-47198-0039 WITH WHICH THE HEART OF THE EXILE IS SAID TO SWELL AT THE SIGHT OF HIS OWN LAND SHE WONDERED IF THE SIGHT OF THEIR COUNTRY MOVED OTHER PASSENGERS ON THE BOAT AS SHE HERSELF WAS MOVED AND MADE TIMID ADVANCES TO A LADY WHO WAS STANDING NEAR HER
5703-47198-0040 HAVE YOU BEEN AWAY FROM ENGLAND A LONG TIME SHE ASKED HER I HAVE BEEN ABROAD DURING A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD REPLIED THE PERSON SHE ADDRESSED A STERN LOOKING SCOTCHWOMAN WHO DID NOT APPEAR ANXIOUS TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION
5703-47198-0041 FROM HER SEVERE DEMEANOUR JULIET IMAGINED SHE MIGHT BE A GOVERNESS GOING FOR A HOLIDAY YOU MUST BE GLAD TO BE GOING HOME SHE VENTURED IT'S A FAR CRY NORTH TO MY HOME SAID THE SCOTCHWOMAN THAWING SLIGHTLY
5703-47198-0042 THERE MAY EVEN BE A SCOTCHMAN AMONG THE PORTERS YOU KNOW BY SOME CHANCE NO FEAR SAID HER NEIGHBOUR GLOOMILY THEY'LL BE LOCAL MEN I HAVE NAE DOUBT
5703-47198-0043 WHICH IS ONE OF THE BONNIEST THINGS YOU SEE ON THE CONTINENT TO MY WAY OF THINKING JULIET COULD GET NO ENTHUSIASM OUT OF HER AND LOOK WHICH WAY SHE MIGHT SHE COULD NOT SEE ANY REFLECTION ON THE FACES OF THOSE AROUND HER OF THE EMOTIONS WHICH STIRRED IN HER OWN BREAST
5703-47198-0044 IT HAD BEEN A ROUGH CROSSING IN SPITE OF THE CLOUDLESS SKY AND BROILING SUNSHINE AND MOST OF THE PASSENGERS HAD BEEN LAID LOW BY THE ROLLING OF THE VESSEL THEY DISPLAYED ANXIETY ENOUGH TO REACH LAND
5703-47198-0045 NO DOUBT SHE THOUGHT WHEN THE SHIP STOPPED AND THEY FELT BETTER THEY WOULD BE MORE DISPOSED TO A SENTIMENTALITY LIKE HERS SHE FOUND HER MAID WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE MOST SEA SICK OF THOSE ABOARD AND ASSISTED HER ASHORE
5703-47198-0046 PUT HER INTO A CARRIAGE AND MINISTERED TO HER WANTS WITH THE HELP OF A TEA BASKET CONTAINING THE DELICIOUS NOVELTY OF ENGLISH BREAD AND BUTTER IN HALF AN HOUR'S TIME THEY WERE STEAMING HURRIEDLY TOWARDS LONDON SHE WAS TO LODGE AT A SMALL HOTEL IN JERMYN STREET
5703-47198-0047 SHE WAS YOUNG STRONG AND HEALTHY AND THERE WAS NO REASON THAT TRIFLING DISCOMFORTS OF THIS KIND SHOULD AFFECT HER ENJOYMENT TO THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE BED INDEED SHE SHUT HER EYES IN MORE SENSES THAN ONE
5703-47198-0048 FOR SHE WAS ASLEEP THREE MINUTES AFTER HER HEAD TOUCHED THE PILLOW NOR DID SHE WAKE TILL HER MAID ROUSED HER THE NEXT MORNING
5703-47198-0049 OVER THE ROOFS OF THE HOUSES OPPOSITE SHE COULD SEE A BLUE STREAK OF SKY ALREADY THE AIR HAD LOST THE TOUCH OF FRESHNESS WHICH COMES EVEN TO LONDON IN AUGUST DURING THE FIRST HOURS OF THE MORNING
5703-47198-0050 AND THE HEAT IN THE LOW CEILINGED ROOM ON THE THIRD FLOOR WHICH JULIET OCCUPIED FOR THE SAKE OF ECONOMY WAS OPPRESSIVE IN SPITE OF THE SMALL SASH WINDOWS BEING OPENED TO THEIR UTMOST CAPACITY
5703-47198-0051 BUT JULIET ONLY LAUGHED TO HERSELF WITH PLEASURE AT THE BRILLIANCY OF THE DAY SHE FELT THAT THE WEATHER WAS PLAYING UP TO THE OCCASION AS BECAME THIS IMPORTANT MORNING OF HER LIFE FOR THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT SHE DID NOT DOUBT
5703-47198-0052 SHE WAS GOING TO HEAR TREMENDOUS NEWS THAT DAY MAKE WONDERFUL DISCOVERIES ABOUT HER BIRTH HEAR UNDREAMT OF THINGS
5703-47198-0053 AND IT WOULD NOT HAVE ASTONISHED HER TO FIND HERSELF CLAIMED AS DAUGHTER BY ANY OF THE REIGNING FAMILIES OF EUROPE SHE WAS PREPARED FOR ANYTHING OR SO SHE SAID TO HERSELF HOWEVER ASTOUNDING AND THAT BEING SO SHE WAS EXCITED IN PROPORTION
5703-47198-0054 ANYONE COULD HAVE TOLD HER THAT BY THIS ATTITUDE OF MIND TOWARDS THE FUTURE SHE WAS LAYING UP FOR HERSELF DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE LEAST IF NOT THE BITTEREST DISILLUSIONS BUT THERE WAS NO ONE TO THROW COLD WATER ON HER HOPES
5703-47198-0055 AND SHE FILLED THE AIR WITH CASTLES OF EVERY STYLE OF ARCHITECTURE THAT HER FANCY SUGGESTED WITHOUT ANY HINDRANCE FROM DOUBT OR MISGIVING SHE DRESSED QUICKLY IN THE GAYEST HUMOUR BUT WITH EVEN MORE CARE THAN SHE USUALLY BESTOWED UPON HER APPEARANCE
5703-47198-0056 SCANDALIZED AT THE IDEA OF SUCH A PRECIOUS GARMENT BEING PUT ON BEFORE BREAKFAST THAT VERY ONE JULIET ASSURED HER UNDAUNTED AND WAS ARRAYED IN IT IN SPITE OF OBVIOUS DISAPPROVAL AFTER BREAKFAST THEY WENT OUT
5703-47198-0057 AND INQUIRING THEIR WAY TO BOND STREET FLATTENED THEIR NOSES AGAINST THE SHOP WINDOWS TO THEIR MUTUAL SATISFACTION THEY HAD IT ALMOST TO THEMSELVES FOR THERE WERE NOT MANY PEOPLE LEFT IN THAT PART OF LONDON
5703-47198-0058 BUT MORE THAN ONE HEAD WAS TURNED TO GAZE AT THE PRETTY GIRL IN THE GARDEN PARTY DRESS WHO STOOD TRANSFIXED BEFORE SHOP AFTER SHOP THIS AMUSEMENT LASTED TILL HALF PAST ELEVEN WHEN THEY RETURNED TO THE HOTEL FOR JULIET TO GIVE THE FINAL PATS TO HER HAIR
5703-47198-0059 BEFORE SHE STARTED TO KEEP HER APPOINTMENT WITH THE SOLICITORS
5703-47212-0000 WITH HER WHITE PAINT AND HER SCARLET SMOKESTACK THE INVERASHIEL ONE OF THE TWO SMALL STEAMERS THAT DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS PLIED UP AND DOWN THE LOCH AND INCIDENTALLY CARRIED ON COMMUNICATION BETWEEN INVERASHIEL AND CRIANAN
5703-47212-0001 WAS A PICTURESQUE ADDITION TO THE LANDSCAPE AS SHE APPROACHED THE WOODEN LANDING STAGE THAT STOOD HALF A MILE BELOW THE PROMONTORY ON WHICH THE CASTLE WAS BUILT IT WAS THE MORNING OF FRIDAY THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FUNERAL
5703-47212-0002 IN SPITE OF THE BRILLIANT SUNSET OF THE PREVIOUS EVENING THE LOCH LAY DARK AND STILL ITS SURFACE WORE AN OILY TREACHEROUS LOOK EVERY DETAIL OF THE INVERASHIEL'S TUB LIKE SHAPE WAS REFLECTED AND BEAUTIFULLY DISTORTED IN THE WATER
5703-47212-0003 AS THE FEW PASSENGERS WHO WERE WAITING FOR HER CROSSED THE SHORT GANGWAY A SHOWER BURST OVER THE LOCH AND IN A FEW MINUTES HAD DRIVEN EVERY ONE INTO THE LITTLE CABIN EXCEPT THE TWO OR THREE MEN WHO CONSTITUTED THE OFFICERS AND CREW OF THE STEAMER
5703-47212-0004 ONE OF THESE WAS IN THE ACT OF SLACKENING THE ROPE BY WHICH THE BOAT HAD BEEN WARPED ALONGSIDE WHEN A RUNNING GESTICULATING FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DISTANCE SHOUTING TO THEM TO WAIT FOR HIM WAITED FOR ACCORDINGLY HE WAS AND IN A FEW MINUTES GIMBLET
5703-47212-0005 RATHER OUT OF BREATH AFTER HIS RUN HURRIED ON BOARD AND WITH A WORD OF APOLOGY AND THANKS TO THE OBLIGING SKIPPER TURNED LIKE THE OTHER PASSENGERS TOWARDS THE SHELTER OF THE CABIN WITH HIS HAND ON THE KNOB OF THE DOOR HE HESITATED
5703-47212-0006 THROUGH THE GLASS TOP HE HAD JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF A FIGURE THAT SEEMED FAMILIAR HE HAD SEEN THAT TWEED BEFORE THE SHORT GIRL WITH HER BACK TO HIM WAS WEARING THE DRESS IN WHICH HE HAD SEEN HER ON THE WEDNESDAY NIGHT
5703-47212-0007 SEARCHING AMONG LORD ASHIEL'S PAPERS IN THE LIBRARY AT THE CASTLE IT WAS JULIA ROMANINOV BEYOND A DOUBT AND GIMBLET DREW BACK QUICKLY AND TOOK UP HIS POSITION BEHIND THE FUNNELS ON THE AFTER DECK
5703-47212-0008 IN SPITE OF THE RAIN HE REMAINED THERE UNTIL THE BOAT REACHED CRIANAN LEANING AGAINST THE RAIL WITH HIS COLLAR TURNED UP AND HIS SOFT FELT HAT PULLED DOWN OVER HIS EARS SO THAT LITTLE OF HIM WAS VISIBLE EXCEPT THE TIP OF HIS NOSE
5703-47212-0009 HIS MIND ALWAYS ACTIVE WAS BUSIER THAN USUAL AS HE WATCHED THE RIPPLES ROLL AWAY IN ENDLESS SUCCESSION FROM THE SIDES OF THE INVERASHIEL WHICH LOOKED SO STRANGELY LESS WHITE ON CLOSER INSPECTION
5703-47212-0010 OR FOLLOWED THE SMOOTH SOARING MOVEMENTS OF THE GULLS THAT SWOOPED AND CIRCLED AROUND HER
5703-47212-0011 AS THEY DREW NEAR TO CRIANAN HE CONCEALED HIMSELF STILL MORE CAREFULLY BEHIND A PILE OF CRATES AND NOT TILL MISS ROMANINOV HAD LEFT THE STEAMER DID HE EMERGE FROM HIS HIDING PLACE AND STEP WARILY OFF THE BOAT
5703-47212-0012 THE YOUNG LADY WAS STILL IN SIGHT MAKING HER WAY UP THE STEEP PITCH OF THE MAIN STREET AND THE DETECTIVE FOLLOWED HER DISCREETLY LOITERING BEFORE SHOP WINDOWS AS IF FASCINATED BY THE DISPLAY OF SCOTTISH HOMESPUNS
5703-47212-0013 OR SAMPLES OF ROYAL STEWART TARTAN AND TAKING AN EXTRAORDINARY INTEREST IN FISHING TACKLE AND TROUT FLIES BUT THOUGH THE GIRL LOOKED BACK MORE THAN ONCE THE LITTLE MAN IN THE ULSTER WHO WAS SO INTENT ON PICKING HIS WAY BETWEEN THE PUDDLES
5703-47212-0014 DID NOT APPARENTLY PROVIDE HER WITH ANY FOOD FOR SUSPICION AND SHE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO SEE WHO WAS SO CAREFULLY SHELTERED BENEATH THE UMBRELLA HE CARRIED AT LAST THEY LEFT THE COBBLE STONES OF THE LITTLE TOWN AND EMERGED UPON THE HIGH ROAD
5703-47212-0015 WHICH HERE RAN ACROSS THE OPEN MOORLAND IT WAS DIFFICULT NOW TO CONTINUE THE PURSUIT UNOBSERVED AND GIMBLET BECAME ABSORBED IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF AN ENORMOUS CAIRNGORM
5703-47212-0016 WHICH WAS MASQUERADING AS AN ARTICLE OF PERSONAL ADORNMENT IN THE WINDOW OF THE LAST OUTLYING SHOP FROM THIS POSITION NOT WITHOUT ITS EMBARRASSMENTS SINCE A COUPLE OF BAREFOOTED CHILDREN CAME INSTANTLY TO THE DOOR WHERE THEY STOOD AND STARED AT HIM UNBLINKINGLY
5703-47212-0017 HE SAW THE RUSSIAN ADVANCING AT A RAPID PACE ACROSS THE MOOR AND LOOK WHERE HE WOULD COULD PERCEIVE NO MEANS OF KEEPING UP WITH HER UNOBSERVED UPON THE BARE SIDE OF THE HILL JUST AS HE DECIDED THAT THE DISTANCE SEPARATING THEM HAD INCREASED TO AN EXTENT
5703-47212-0018 WHICH WARRANTED HIS CONTINUING THE CHASE HE JOYFULLY SAW HER SLACKEN HER PACE AND AT THE SAME MOMENT A MAN WHO MUST HAVE BEEN SITTING BEHIND A BOULDER BESIDE THE ROAD ROSE TO HIS FEET OUT OF THE HEATHER AND CAME FORWARD TO MEET HER
5703-47212-0019 FOR TEN LONG MINUTES THEY STOOD TALKING DRIVING POOR GIMBLET TO THE DESPERATE EXPEDIENT OF ENTERING THE SHOP AND DEMANDING A CLOSER ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE CAIRNGORM IT IS HUMILIATING TO RELATE THAT HE RECOILED BEFORE IT WHEN IT WAS PLACED IN HIS HAND
5703-47212-0020 AND NEARLY FLED AGAIN INTO THE ROAD HOWEVER HE PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER AND HELD THE PROUD PROPRIETRESS A GAUNT GREY HAIRED WOMAN WITH KNITTING NEEDLES EVER CLICKING IN HER DEXTEROUS HANDS
5703-47212-0021 IN CONVERSATION UPON THE THEME OF ITS UNIQUE BEAUTIES UNTIL THE SUBJECT WAS EXHAUSTED TO THE POINT OF COLLAPSE EVERY OTHER MINUTE HE MUST STROLL TO THE DOOR AND TAKE A LOOK UP AND DOWN THE ROAD A FRIEND HE EXPLAINED HAD PROMISED TO MEET HIM IN THAT PLACE
5703-47212-0022 AND THOUGH THE SHOPWOMAN PLAINLY DOUBTED HIS VERACITY AND KEPT A SHARP EYE THAT HE DID NOT TAKE TO HIS HEELS WITH THE CAIRNGORM SHE DID NOT GO SO FAR AS TO SUGGEST HIS REMOVING HIMSELF FROM THE ZONE OF TEMPTATION
5703-47212-0023 AT LAST WHEN FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME HE PUT HIS NOSE ROUND THE DOORPOST HE SAW THAT THE PAIR HAD SEPARATED AND WERE WALKING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS THE GIRL CONTINUING ON HER WAY WHILE THE MAN RETURNED TO THE TOWN
5703-47212-0024 HE WAS INDEED NOT A HUNDRED YARDS OFF GIMBLET PLUNGED ONCE MORE INTO THE SHOP AND FASTENED UPON SOME PENCILS WITH A ZEAL NOT VERY CONVINCING AFTER HIS DISAPPOINTING VACILLATION OVER THE BROOCH
5703-47212-0025 WHICH SHE PRESSED UPON HIM AS PARTICULARLY SUITED TO HIS NEEDS AND CHARGED HIM FOURPENCE FOR BY THE TIME HE ISSUED FORTH INTO THE OPEN AIR HIS POCKETS FULL OF PACKAGES THE STRANGER HAD PASSED THE SHOP AND WAS TURNING THE CORNER OF THE NEXT HOUSE
5703-47212-0026 TO HIM NOW GIMBLET DEVOTED HIS POWERS OF SHADOWING THERE WAS NO GREAT DIFFICULTY ABOUT IT THE MAN WALKED STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM LOOKING NEITHER TO THE RIGHT NOR TO THE LEFT
5703-47212-0027 NARROW POINTED FOOTPRINTS THAT WERE DEEPLY IMPRESSED IN THE MUDDY PLACES HE HAD NO DOUBT THEY WERE THE SAME AS THOSE HE HAD NOTICED ON THE BEACH ON THE DAY OF HIS ARRIVAL AT INVERASHIEL
5703-47212-0028 THE STRANGER TURNED INTO THE CRIANAN HOTEL WHICH STANDS ON THE LAKE FRONT FIFTY YARDS FROM THE LANDING PLACE OF THE LOCH STEAMERS GIMBLET PASSED THE DOOR WITHOUT PAUSING AND WENT DOWN TO THE LOCH WHERE HE MINGLED WITH THE BOATMEN AND LOAFERS WHO CONGREGATED BY THE WATERSIDE
5703-47212-0029 HE KEPT HOWEVER A STRICT EYE ON THE DOOR OF THE HOTEL AND AFTER A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SAW THE OBJECT OF HIS ATTENTIONS EMERGE WITH FISHING ROD AND BASKET
5703-47212-0030 BUT NOW HE HAD A GOOD LOOK AS HE PASSED CLOSE BESIDE HIM HE WAS A TALL FAIR MAN EVIDENTLY A FOREIGNER BUT WITH NOTHING VERY STRIKING ABOUT HIS APPEARANCE A POINTED YELLOW BEARD HID THE LOWER PART OF HIS FACE
5703-47212-0031 AND FOR THE REST HIS NOSE WAS SHORT HIS EYES BLUE AND CLOSE TOGETHER AND HIS FOREHEAD HIGH AND NARROW HE LOOKED CLOSELY AT GIMBLET AS HE WENT BY AND FOR A MOMENT THE EYES OF THE TWO MEN MET
5703-47212-0032 BOTH EQUALLY INSCRUTABLE AND UNFLINCHING THEN THE STRANGER GLANCED ASIDE AND STRODE ON TO WHERE A SMALL BOAT LAY MOORED THE DETECTIVE TURNED HIS BACK WHILE THE FAIR MAN GOT IN AND PUSHED OFF INTO THE LOCH GENTLEMAN GOING FISHING
5703-47212-0033 HE'S AXTRA FOND O THE FEESHIN WAS THE REPLY FOR A THAT HE'S A FOREIGN SHENTLEMAN WAITING TILL THE BOAT HAD BECOME A DISTANT SPECK ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS GIMBLET MADE HIS WAY INTO THE INN AND ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH THE LANDLORD
5703-47212-0034 ON THE PRETEXT OF ENGAGING ROOMS FOR A FRIEND THE LANDLORD WAS SORRY BUT THE HOUSE WAS FULL
5703-47212-0035 FOLKS TAK THEIR ROOMS A MONTH IN ADVANCE THEY COME HERE FOR THE FISHIN ON THE LOCH
5703-47212-0036 INDEED I CAN WELL BELIEVE THAT GIMBLET ASSURED HIM I SUPPOSE YOU GET A LOT OF TOURISTS PASSING THROUGH THOUGH AMERICANS FOR INSTANCE
5703-47212-0037 I SELDOM HAE AN AMERICAN BIDIN HERE THEY MAISTLY GANG DOON THE LOCH SAID THE INNKEEPER I THOUGHT SAID GIMBLET THAT WAS A FOREIGN LOOKING MAN WHOM I SAW A LITTLE WHILE AGO COMING OUT OF THE HOTEL

5703-47212-0040 DEAR ME SAID GIMBLET JUST WHAT MY FRIEND WANTS I'M SORRY YOU CAN'T TAKE HIM IN I MUST TELL HIM TO WRITE IN GOOD TIME NEXT YEAR IF HE WANTS A ROOM AS HE PARTED FROM THE LANDLORD UPON THE DOORSTEP OF THE CRIANAN HOTEL THE ROB ROY
5703-47212-0041 THE SECOND OF THE TWO LOCH STEAMERS WAS EDGING AWAY FROM THE PIER UNDER A CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE FROM HER FUNNEL THE RAIN HAD STOPPED THE PASSENGERS WERE SCATTERED ON THE DECK
5703-47212-0042 AND IN THE BOWS OF THE VESSEL THE DETECTIVE CAUGHT SIGHT OF JULIA ROMANINOV'S TWEED CLAD FORM SHE WAS LEANING AGAINST THE RAIL AND GAZING AT A DISTANT PART OF THE LOCH WHERE A BLACK SPECK
5703-47212-0043 IT WAS AS GIMBLET HAD EXPECTED AND THOUGH HE CHAFED AT THE DELAY HE REGRETTED LESS THAN HE WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE THAT HE COULD NOT CATCH THE ROB ROY THE INVERASHIEL WOULD BE DUE ON HER HOMEWARD TRIP IN A COUPLE OF HOURS TIME
5703-47212-0044 AND MEANWHILE HE HAD OTHER BUSINESS THAT MUST BE ATTENDED TO HE WENT FIRST TO THE POST OFFICE WHERE HE REGISTERED AND POSTED TO SCOTLAND YARD A PACKET HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM THEN AFTER ASKING HIS WAY OF THE SOCIABLE LANDLORD OF THE HOTEL
5703-47212-0045 HE PROCEEDED TO THE POLICE STATION A SINGLE STORIED STONE BUILDING STANDING AT THE END OF A SIDE STREET HERE HE MADE HIMSELF KNOWN TO THE INSPECTOR AND IMPARTED INFORMATION WHICH MADE THAT PERSONAGE OPEN HIS EYES CONSIDERABLY WIDER THAN WAS HIS CUSTOM
5703-47212-0046 IF YOU WILL BRING ONE OF YOUR MEN AND COME WITH ME YOURSELF SAID GIMBLET AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE INTERVIEW
5703-47212-0047 IN THE MEANTIME THERE WILL BE NO HARM DONE BY A WATCH BEING KEPT ON THE FOREIGN GENTLEMAN WHO IS AT THIS MOMENT TROLLING FOR SALMON ON THE LOCH THE INSPECTOR AGREED AND WHEN THE INVERASHIEL STARTED AN HOUR LATER ON HER VOYAGE DOWN THE LOCH
5703-47212-0048 SHE CARRIED THE TWO POLICEMEN ON HER DECK AS WELL AS THE MOST NOTORIOUS DETECTIVE SHE WAS EVER LIKELY TO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF CONVEYING IT WAS NEARLY THREE O'CLOCK WHEN THEY LANDED ON THE INVERASHIEL PIER
5703-47212-0049 THE WEATHER WHICH FOR THE LAST FEW HOURS HAD LOOKED LIKE CLEARING HAD NOW TURNED DEFINITELY TO RAIN CLOUDS HAD DESCENDED ON THE HILLS AND THE TREES IN THE VALLEYS STOOPED AND DRIPPED IN THE SATURATED MIST LADEN AIR
5703-47212-0050 GIMBLET CONDUCTED THE MEN TO THE COTTAGE WHERE LADY RUTH ANXIOUSLY AWAITED THEM IF YOU DON'T MIND THEIR STAYING HERE HE SUGGESTED TO HER WHILE I GO UP TO THE CASTLE AND CONSULT LORD ASHIEL ABOUT A MAGISTRATE IT WILL BE MOST CONVENIENT ON ACCOUNT OF THE DISTANCE
5703-47212-0051 BY ALL MEANS SAID LADY RUTH I FEEL SAFER WITH THEM I EXPECT YOU WILL FIND MISS BYRNE UP THERE SHE HAS NOT COME IN TO LUNCH AND I THINK SHE PROBABLY MET MARK AND WENT TO LUNCH AT THE CASTLE SHE OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER THAN TO GO TO LUNCH ALONE WITH A YOUNG MAN
5703-47212-0052 AND I AM JUST WONDERING IF SHE HAS CHANGED HER MIND AND ACCEPTED HIM AFTER ALL GIRLS ARE KITTLE CATTLE BUT I'VE GOT QUITE FOND OF THAT ONE AND I HOPE SHE'S NOT FORGOTTEN POOR DAVID SO SOON I REALLY AM FEELING ANXIOUS ABOUT HER
5750-100289-0000 THE CONTRARY IS TRUE WHAT WE NEED IS NOT LESS EDUCATION BUT MORE MORE TRAINED LEADERS TO UPHOLD THE STANDARDS OF CIVILIZATION BEFORE BOTH RACES AMONG INDIAN COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY GRADUATES A FAILURE IS VERY RARE
5750-100289-0001 I AM SURE I HAVE NOT MET ONE AND REALLY DO NOT KNOW OF ONE THE PRESS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY POPULAR ERRORS WHENEVER AN INDIAN INDULGES IN ANY NOTORIOUS MISBEHAVIOR HE IS WIDELY HERALDED AS A CARLISLE GRADUATE
5750-100289-0002 ALTHOUGH BECAUSE OF THE WONDERFUL ATHLETIC PROWESS OF ITS STUDENTS THEY HAVE MET AND DEFEATED THE ATHLETES OF MANY A WHITE UNIVERSITY ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD
5750-100289-0003 GIVING A FAIR KNOWLEDGE OF SOME TRADE TOGETHER WITH THE ESSENTIALS OF AN ENGLISH EDUCATION BUT NO LATIN OR OTHER FOREIGN LANGUAGE CONSEQUENTLY ITS GRADUATES MUST ATTEND A HIGHER PREPARATORY SCHOOL FOR SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE THEY CAN ENTER COLLEGE
5750-100289-0004 IT WILL BE SEEN THEN THAT THE COLLEGE EDUCATED MEN AND WOMEN OF MY RACE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED QUITE A FEAT CONSIDERING THEIR ANTECEDENTS AND WHOLLY FOREIGN POINT OF VIEW THEY HAVE HAD TO ADJUST THEMSELVES TO A NEW WAY OF THINKING
5750-100289-0005 FURTHERMORE THEY ARE ALMOST ALWAYS HAMPERED BY LACK OF MEANS NEVERTHELESS AN INCREASING NUMBER HAVE SUCCEEDED IN THE UNDERTAKING TRIALS OF THE EDUCATED INDIAN
5750-100289-0006 I WISH TO CONTRADICT THE POPULAR MISCONCEPTION THAT AN EDUCATED INDIAN WILL NECESSARILY MEET WITH STRONG PREJUDICE AMONG HIS OWN PEOPLE OR WILL BE EDUCATED OUT OF SYMPATHY WITH THEM FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW
5750-100289-0007 A PARTICULARLY ABLE OR WELL EQUIPPED MAN OF THEIR RACE IS A PUBLIC BLESSING AND ALL BUT PUBLIC PROPERTY THAT WAS THE OLD RULE AMONG US UP TO A VERY RECENT PERIOD AN EDUCATED INDIAN COULD NOT SUCCEED MATERIALLY
5750-100289-0008 HE COULD NOT BETTER HIMSELF BECAUSE THE PEOPLE REQUIRED HIM TO GIVE UNLIMITED FREE SERVICE ACCORDING TO THE OLD REGIME I HAVE EVEN KNOWN ONE TO BE KILLED BY THE CONTINUAL DEMANDS UPON HIM THERE WAS A TIME NOT SO LONG AGO EITHER
5750-100289-0009 WHEN THE EDUCATED INDIAN STOOD IN A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION BETWEEN HIS PEOPLE AND THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND SHADY POLITICIANS EVERY COMPLAINT WAS BROUGHT TO HIM AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND HE WAS EXPECTED TO EXPOSE AND REDRESS EVERY WRONG
5750-100289-0010 AS I HAVE SAID ELSEWHERE SUCH EFFORTS ARE GENERALLY USELESS AND RESULTED ONLY IN DAMAGE TO HIS FINANCIAL POSITION AND HIS REPUTATION NO DOUBT HE OFTEN INVITED ATTACKS UPON HIMSELF BY A RASHNESS BORN OF HIS ARDENT SYMPATHY
5750-100289-0011 FOR HIS FELLOW TRIBESMEN IN THIS MATTER I SPEAK FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS LONG OBSERVATION EVEN IN THE OLD WILD DAYS AN EDUCATION WAS APPRECIATED BY THE INDIANS
5750-100289-0012 BUT IT WAS A HARD LIFE FOR THE EDUCATED MAN THEY MADE HIM CARRY TOO HEAVY A BURDEN WITHOUT MUCH RECOMPENSE SAVE HONOR AND RESPECT BUT WE HAVE PRETTY WELL PASSED THROUGH THAT PERIOD AND THE NATIVE GRADUATES OF OUR HIGHER INSTITUTIONS
5750-100289-0013 HAVE BEGUN TO SHOW THEIR STRENGTH AND ENLARGE THEIR VIEWS THEY HAVE NOT ONLY DONE WELL FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR RACE BUT THEY STAND BEFORE THE WORLD AS LIVING ILLUSTRATIONS OF ITS CAPACITY DISPROVING MANY THEORIES CONCERNING UNTUTORED RACES
5750-100289-0014 NO INFERIOR RACE IT WAS DECLARED WITHOUT QUALIFICATION BY THE UNIVERSAL RACES CONGRESS AT LONDON IN NINETEEN ELEVEN THAT THERE IS NO INHERENTLY SUPERIOR RACE
5750-100289-0015 THEREFORE NO INFERIOR RACE FROM EVERY RACE SOME INDIVIDUALS HAVE MASTERED THE SAME CURRICULUM AND PASSED THE SAME TESTS AND IN SOME INSTANCES MEMBERS OF SO CALLED UNCIVILIZED RACES
5750-100289-0016 BECAUSE OF THE RACIAL ENVIRONMENT CHANGE THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE RACE IS TRANSFORMED CERTAINLY THE AMERICAN INDIAN HAS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THE TRUTH OF THIS ASSERTION
5750-100289-0017 THE VERY MENTION OF THE NAME INDIAN IN EARLIER DAYS WOULD MAKE THE AVERAGE WHITE MAN'S BLOOD CREEP WITH THOUGHTS OF THE WAR WHOOP AND THE SCALPING KNIFE
5750-100289-0018 A LITTLE LATER IT SUGGESTED CHIEFLY FEATHERS AND PAINT AND BUFFALO BILL'S WILD WEST TO DAY THE ASSOCIATION IS RATHER WITH THE CARLISLE SCHOOL AND ITS FAMOUS ATHLETES
5750-100289-0019 IT IS A FACT THAT THE INTELLIGENT AND EDUCATED INDIAN HAS NO SOCIAL PREJUDICE TO CONTEND WITH HIS COLOR IS NOT COUNTED AGAINST HIM HE IS RECEIVED CORDIALLY AND UPON EQUAL TERMS IN SCHOOL COLLEGE AND SOCIETY
5750-100289-0020 DOCTOR BOOKER WASHINGTON IS IN THE HABIT OF SAYING JOCOSELY THAT THE NEGRO BLOOD IS THE STRONGEST IN THE WORLD FOR ONE DROP OF IT MAKES A NIGGER OF A WHITE MAN I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE INDIAN BLOOD IS EVEN STRONGER
5750-100289-0021 FOR A HALF BLOOD NEGRO AND INDIAN MAY PASS FOR AN INDIAN AND SO BE ADMITTED TO FIRST CLASS HOTELS AND EVEN TO HIGH SOCIETY
5750-100289-0022 IS TO GET AN EDUCATION AND HOLD UP HIS HEAD AS A MEMBER OF THE OLDEST AMERICAN ARISTOCRACY MANY OF OUR LEADING MEN HAVE MARRIED INTO EXCELLENT FAMILIES AND ARE PROMINENT IN CULTIVATED WHITE COMMUNITIES
5750-100289-0023 WE WANT THE BEST IN TWO RACES AND CIVILIZATIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR WHAT WE HAVE LOST SOME OF US HAVE ENTERED UPON EVERY KNOWN PROFESSIONAL CAREER SUCH AS MEDICINE LAW THE MINISTRY EDUCATION AND THE SCIENCES
5750-100289-0024 POLITICS AND HIGHER BUSINESS MANAGEMENT ART AND LITERATURE IT MAY BE WELL TO MENTION SOME OF OUR BEST KNOWN PROFESSIONAL MEN AND WOMEN
5750-100289-0025 AT FIRST TO BE SURE AS INDIAN HERB DOCTORS OR QUACKS OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER BUT LATER AS COMPETENT GRADUATED PHYSICIANS THE GOVERNMENT HAS UTILIZED SEVERAL IN THE INDIAN SERVICE AND OTHERS HAVE ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN PRIVATE PRACTICE
5750-100289-0026 SOME NOTED INDIANS OF TO DAY PERHAPS THE FOREMOST OF THESE IS DOCTOR CARLOS MONTEZUMA OF CHICAGO A FULL BLOODED APACHE
5750-100289-0027 WHO WERE ENEMIES OF HIS PEOPLE HE WAS BROUGHT TO CHICAGO BY THE MAN WHO RANSOMED HIM A REPORTER AND PHOTOGRAPHER AND WHEN HIS BENEFACTOR DIED THE BOY BECAME THE PROTEGE OF THE CHICAGO PRESS CLUB
5750-100289-0028 AND FROM THERE TO THE NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY WHERE HE WAS GRADUATED FROM THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT ALL THIS TIME ALTHOUGH RECEIVING SOME AID FROM VARIOUS SOURCES HE LARGELY SUPPORTED HIMSELF
5750-100289-0029 AFTER GRADUATION DOCTOR MONTEZUMA WAS SENT BY THE GOVERNMENT AS PHYSICIAN TO AN INDIAN AGENCY IN MONTANA AND LATER TRANSFERRED TO THE CARLISLE SCHOOL IN A FEW YEARS HE RETURNED TO CHICAGO AND OPENED AN OFFICE
5750-100289-0030 HE HAS BEEN A PROMINENT PHYSICIAN THERE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WAS RECENTLY MARRIED TO A LADY OF GERMAN DESCENT HE STANDS UNCOMPROMISINGLY FOR THE TOTAL ABOLITION OF THE RESERVATION SYSTEM AND OF THE INDIAN BUREAU
5750-100289-0031 HOLDING THAT THE RED MAN MUST BE ALLOWED TO WORK OUT HIS OWN SALVATION ONE OF THE EARLIEST PRACTITIONERS OF OUR RACE WAS DOCTOR SUSAN LA FLESCHE PICOTTE OF THE OMAHA TRIBE
5750-100289-0032 SHE HAS SINCE TAKEN UP PRIVATE PRACTICE AND ALSO HAD CHARGE OF A MISSION HOSPITAL DOCTOR PICOTTE IS A SISTER OF BRIGHT EYES SUSETTE LA FLESCHE AND ALSO OF FRANCIS LA FLESCHE OF WASHINGTON D C
5750-100289-0033 THERE IS ANOTHER INDIAN DOCTOR NOT OF FULL BLOOD WHO IS PRESIDENT OF THE CITY CLUB OF CHICAGO AND ACTIVE IN CIVIC REFORM IN SEVERAL MIDDLE WESTERN CITIES THERE ARE SUCCESSFUL DOCTORS AND DENTISTS OF MY RACE
5750-100289-0034 WAS A SUCCESSFUL LAWYER IN TOPEKA WHEN HE WAS ELECTED TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND LATER TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE HIS MOTHER IS A KAW INDIAN MISTER CURTIS WAS AND IS A LEADER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN HIS STATE
5750-100289-0035 SENATOR OWEN OF OKLAHOMA IS PART CHEROKEE THE WHOLE COUNTRY HAS COME TO REALIZE HIS ABILITY AND INFLUENCE REPRESENTATIVE CARTER OF OKLAHOMA IS ALSO AN INDIAN
5750-100289-0036 DURING MY STUDENT DAYS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE I WAS OFTEN TOLD THAT DANIEL WEBSTER WAS PART INDIAN ON HIS MOTHER'S SIDE CERTAINLY HIS PHYSIOGNOMY AS WELL AS HIS UNEQUALLED LOGIC CORROBORATED THE STORY
5750-100289-0037 WE ALL KNOW THAT GOVERNORS AND OTHER MEN OF MARK HAVE PROCLAIMED THEMSELVES DESCENDANTS OF POCAHONTAS I HAVE MET SEVERAL IN THE WEST AND SOUTH
5750-100289-0038 BUT HAVE NEVER VERIFIED IT THEIR WONDERFUL AGGRESSIVENESS AND DAUNTLESS PUBLIC SERVICE IN MY MIND POINT TO NATIVE DESCENT AND IF THEY CAN TRUTHFULLY CLAIM IT
5750-100289-0039 AS LATE AS EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX DOCTOR WASHINGTON MATHEWS A SURGEON IN THE UNITED STATES ARMY
5750-100289-0040 AND LEFT HIM WITH THE MISSIONARY TEACHER DOCTOR ALFRED L RIGGS TO REAR AND EDUCATE THIS MILITARY SURGEON AND SCIENTIST NOT ONLY ATTAINED THE RANK OF MAJOR GENERAL BUT HE BECAME ONE OF OUR FOREMOST ARCHAEOLOGISTS
5750-100289-0041 I WILL NOT PRETEND TO CLAIM FOR THE INDIAN ALL THE CREDIT OF THEIR TALENTS AND ENERGY IN THE MINISTRY WE HAVE MANY ABLE AND DEVOTED MEN MORE THAN IN ANY OTHER PROFESSION
5750-100289-0042 IS WELL KNOWN AS AN EVANGELISTIC PREACHER AND SINGER
5750-100289-0043 A FULL BLOOD ARAPAHOE HE HAS HAD AN UNUSUAL CAREER HAVING BEEN TAKEN PRISONER AS A BOY BY AN OFFICER OF THE ARMY HE WAS SENT TO SCHOOL AND EVENTUALLY GRADUATED FROM BISHOP WHIPPLE'S SEABURY DIVINITY SCHOOL AT FARIBAULT MINNESOTA
5750-100289-0044 SINCE THAT TIME DOCTOR COOLIDGE HAS DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THE CHRISTIANIZATION OF HIS RACE
5750-100289-0045 HE HAD UNUSUAL ELOQUENCE AND PERSONAL CHARM AND BECAME AT ONCE ONE OF BISHOP HARE'S ABLEST HELPERS IN HIS GREAT WORK AMONG THE SIOUX STATIONED AT PINE RIDGE AT THE TIME OF THE WOUNDED KNEE MASSACRE
5750-100289-0046 HE OPENED HIS CHURCH TO THE WOUNDED INDIAN PRISONERS AS AN EMERGENCY HOSPITAL HIS MUCH REGRETTED DEATH OCCURRED A FEW MONTHS LATER HE WAS A TIRELESS WORKER AND MUCH LOVED BY HIS PEOPLE
5750-100289-0047 GRADUATED FROM YALE AND OBERLIN
5750-100289-0048 HAS DONE GOOD WORK AS FIELD SECRETARY AMONG THE INDIANS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS I SHOULD ADD THAT THERE ARE MANY MINISTERS OF MY RACE WHO HAVE NO COLLEGE DEGREE NOR MUCH EDUCATION IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE YET WHO ARE AMONG OUR MOST ABLE AND INFLUENTIAL LEADERS
5750-100289-0049 WHO PASSED BUT A SHORT TIME IN SCHOOL HAS NOT ONLY BEEN A SUCCESSFUL PREACHER AMONG THE SIOUX BUT FOR MANY YEARS THEIR TRUSTED ADVISER AND REPRESENTATIVE TO LOOK AFTER THEIR INTERESTS AT THE NATIONAL CAPITAL
5750-100289-0050 MOST OF THEM IN THE UNITED STATES INDIAN SERVICE IT IS THE EXPRESS POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT TO USE THE EDUCATED INDIANS WHENEVER POSSIBLE IN PROMOTING THE ADVANCEMENT OF THEIR RACE INDEED SOME OF THE TREATIES INCLUDE THIS STIPULATION
5750-100289-0051 AND ALTHOUGH THEY MUST PASS A CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATION TO PROVE THEIR FITNESS SUCH EXAMINATION IN THEIR CASE IS NON COMPETITIVE THEY HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN THE LARGER GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS IN MANY INSTANCES WITH THE ADDITION OF NORMAL AND COLLEGE COURSES
5750-100289-0052 AT LEAST TWO ARE SUPERINTENDENTS OF SCHOOLS A NUMBER OF YOUNG WOMEN CARLISLE GRADUATES HAVE TAKEN UP TRAINED NURSING AS A PROFESSION AND ARE PRACTISING SUCCESSFULLY BOTH AMONG WHITES AND INDIANS
5750-100289-0053 IN THE SCIENCES ESPECIALLY IN ETHNOLOGY AND ARCHAEOLOGY WE HAVE SEVERAL WHO HAVE RENDERED MATERIAL SERVICE WILLIAM JONES A SAC AND FOX QUARTER BLOOD WAS A GRADUATE OF HAMPTON AND OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY
5750-100289-0054 DOCTOR PUTNAM AND DOCTOR BOAS THE LATTER HAS CALLED HIM ONE OF OUR ABLEST ARCHAEOLOGISTS DOCTOR JONES TRAVELLED AMONG THE VARIOUS TRIBES EVEN TO THE COAST OF LABRADOR AND LABORED ASSIDUOUSLY IN THE CAUSE OF SCIENCE FOR HARVARD

5750-100289-0059 WHICH ATTRACTED FAVORABLE ATTENTION AND WERE FOLLOWED BY A LITTLE VOLUME OF INDIAN LEGENDS AND SEVERAL SHORT STORIES MISSUS BONNEY HAS MORE RECENTLY WRITTEN THE BOOK OF AN INDIAN OPERA CALLED THE SUN DANCE WHICH HAS BEEN PRODUCED IN SALT LAKE CITY
5750-100289-0060 BY UNIVERSITY STUDENTS JOHN OSKINSON A CHEROKEE WAS FIRST HEARD OF AS THE WINNER IN AN INTERCOLLEGIATE LITERARY CONTEST AND HE IS NOW ON THE STAFF OF COLLIER'S WEEKLY THE FIVE CIVILIZED NATIONS OF OKLAHOMA

5750-100289-0062 MISTER HILL OF TEXAS IS REPUTED TO BE A MILLIONAIRE HOWARD GANSWORTH A GRADUATE OF CARLISLE AND PRINCETON
5750-100289-0063 IN THE ATHLETIC WORLD THIS LITTLE RACE HAS NO PEER AS IS SUFFICIENTLY PROVEN BY THEIR REMARKABLE RECORD IN FOOTBALL BASEBALL AND TRACK ATHLETICS
5750-100289-0064 WHY HE DID NOT INTRODUCE FOOTBALL IN HIS SCHOOL WHY SAID HE IF I DID THAT HALF THE PRESS OF THE COUNTRY WOULD ATTACK ME FOR DEVELOPING THE ORIGINAL WAR INSTINCTS AND SAVAGERY OF THE INDIAN THE PUBLIC WOULD BE AFRAID TO COME TO OUR GAMES
5750-100289-0065 AT LEAST NOT IN PUBLIC NOT LONG AFTERWARD THE GAME WAS INTRODUCED AT CARLISLE AND I WAS ASKED BY THE GENERAL TO VISIT MONTANA AND THE DAKOTAS TO SECURE PUPILS FOR THE SCHOOL AND INCIDENTALLY RECRUITS FOR HIS FOOTBALL WARRIORS
5750-100289-0066 THE INDIANS VICTORY WAS COMPLETE THESE BOYS ALWAYS FIGHT THE BATTLE ON ITS OWN MERITS THEY PLAY A CLEAN GAME AND LOSE VERY FEW GAMES DURING THE SEASON ALTHOUGH THEY MEET ALL OUR LEADING UNIVERSITIES EACH ON ITS OWN HOME GROUNDS
5750-100289-0067 FROM THE FLEET DEERFOOT TO THIS DAY WE BOAST THE NOTED NAMES OF LONGBOAT SOCKALEXIS BEMUS PIERCE FRANK HUDSON TEWANIMA METOXEN MYERS BENDER AND JIM THORPE
5750-100289-0068 THORPE IS A GRADUATE OF THE CARLISLE SCHOOL AND AT THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN SWEDEN IN NINETEEN TWELVE HE WON THE TITLE OF THE GREATEST ALL ROUND ATHLETE IN THE WORLD PROBLEMS OF RACE LEADERSHIP
5750-100289-0069 AND WITH OLD TRIBAL JEALOUSIES AND ANTAGONISMS YET TO BE OVERCOME ANOTHER AND A MORE SERIOUS OBSTACLE IS THE DEPENDENT POSITION OF THE INDIAN AND THE ALMOST ARBITRARY POWER IN THE HANDS OF THE INDIAN BUREAU
5750-100289-0070 ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THE IDEA OF A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF PROGRESSIVE INDIANS WAS DISCUSSED AT SOME LENGTH
5750-100289-0071 MY BROTHER JOHN EASTMAN AND MYSELF AT THAT TIME WE CONCLUDED THAT THE MOVEMENT WOULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD EITHER BY OUR OWN RACE OR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN GENERAL AND THAT THERE WAS GRAVE DANGER OF AROUSING THE ANTAGONISM OF THE BUREAU
5750-100289-0072 IF SUCH A SOCIETY WERE FORMED IT WOULD NECESSARILY TAKE MANY PROBLEMS OF THE RACE UNDER CONSIDERATION AND THE OFFICIALS AT WASHINGTON AND IN THE FIELD ARE SENSITIVE TO CRITICISM
5750-100289-0073 NOR ARE THEY ACCUSTOMED TO ALLOWING THE INDIAN A VOICE IN HIS OWN AFFAIRS FURTHERMORE MANY OF THE MOST PROGRESSIVE RED MEN ARE ENLISTED IN THE GOVERNMENT SERVICE WHICH WOULD MAKE THEIR POSITION A VERY DIFFICULT ONE IN CASE OF ANY FRICTION WITH THE AUTHORITIES
5750-100289-0074 VERY FEW INDIANS ARE SUFFICIENTLY INDEPENDENT OF THE BUREAU TO SPEAK AND ACT WITH ABSOLUTE FREEDOM SOME TEN YEARS LATER I WAS CALLED TO COLUMBUS OHIO TO LECTURE FOR THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY
5750-100289-0075 ON THE SAME COURSE WITH DOCTOR COOLIDGE AND DOCTOR MONTEZUMA PROFESSOR F A MC KENZIE OF THE UNIVERSITY ARRANGED THE COURSE AND SOON AFTERWARD HE WROTE ME THAT HE BELIEVED THE TIME WAS NOW RIPE TO ORGANIZE OUR SOCIETY
5750-100289-0076 WE CORRESPONDED WITH LEADING INDIANS AND ARRANGED A MEETING AT COLUMBUS FOR THE FOLLOWING APRIL AT THIS MEETING FIVE WERE PRESENT BESIDES MYSELF DOCTOR MONTEZUMA THOMAS SLOAN CHARLES E DAGENETT HENRY STANDINGBEAR
5750-100289-0077 AND MISS LAURA CORNELIUS WE ORGANIZED AS A COMMITTEE AND ISSUED A GENERAL CALL FOR A CONFERENCE IN OCTOBER AT THE UNIVERSITY UPON THE CORDIAL INVITATION OF DOCTOR MC KENZIE AND PRESIDENT THOMPSON
5750-100289-0078 FOUR ANNUAL CONFERENCES HAVE NOW BEEN HELD AND THE FIFTH IS ANNOUNCED FOR NEXT OCTOBER AT OKLAHOMA CITY THE SOCIETY HAS FIVE HUNDRED ACTIVE AND ABOUT THE SAME NUMBER OF ASSOCIATE MEMBERS
5750-100289-0079 THE LATTER ARE WHITE FRIENDS OF THE RACE WHO ARE IN SYMPATHY WITH OUR OBJECTS
5750-100289-0080 AND ARTHUR C PARKER IS SECRETARY AND TREASURER THE SOCIETY OF AMERICAN INDIANS ISSUES A QUARTERLY JOURNAL DEVOTED TO THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONFERENCES AND THE INTERESTS OF THE INDIAN RACE
5750-100289-0081 AND THERE ARE OTHERS AS WELL OUR PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN TRAINED TO WORK TOGETHER HARMONIOUSLY IT IS A SERIOUS QUESTION WHAT PRINCIPLES WE SHOULD STAND FOR AND WHAT LINE OF WORK WE OUGHT TO UNDERTAKE
5750-100289-0082 SHOULD WE DEVOTE OURSELVES LARGELY TO EXPOSING THE NUMEROUS FRAUDS COMMITTED UPON INDIANS OR SHOULD WE KEEP CLEAR OF THESE MATTERS AVOID DISCUSSION OF OFFICIAL METHODS AND ACTION
5750-100289-0083 AND SIMPLY AIM AT AROUSING RACIAL PRIDE AND AMBITION ALONG NEW LINES HOLDING UP A MODERN IDEAL FOR THE SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF OUR YOUTH SHOULD WE PETITION CONGRESS AND IN GENERAL CONTINUE ALONG THE LINES OF THE OLDER INDIAN ASSOCIATIONS
5750-100289-0084 OR SHOULD WE RATHER DO INTENSIVE WORK AMONG OUR PEOPLE LOOKING ESPECIALLY TOWARD THEIR MORAL AND SOCIAL WELFARE I STAND FOR THE LATTER PLAN OTHERS THINK DIFFERENTLY AND AS A MATTER OF FACT A WASHINGTON OFFICE HAS BEEN OPENED
5750-100289-0085 OBJECTS OF THE SOCIETY OF AMERICAN INDIANS FIRST TO PROMOTE AND COOPERATE WITH ALL EFFORTS LOOKING TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE INDIAN IN ENLIGHTENMENT WHICH LEAVE HIM FREE AS A MAN
5750-100289-0086 TO DEVELOP ACCORDING TO THE NATURAL LAWS OF SOCIAL EVOLUTION SECOND TO PROVIDE THROUGH OUR OPEN CONFERENCES THE MEANS FOR A FREE DISCUSSION ON ALL SUBJECTS BEARING ON THE WELFARE OF THE RACE THIRD
5750-100289-0087 TO PRESENT IN A JUST LIGHT THE TRUE HISTORY OF THE RACE TO PRESERVE ITS RECORDS AND EMULATE ITS DISTINGUISHING VIRTUES FOURTH TO PROMOTE CITIZENSHIP AND TO OBTAIN THE RIGHTS THEREOF FIFTH
5750-100289-0088 SEVENTH TO DIRECT ITS ENERGIES EXCLUSIVELY TO GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND UNIVERSAL INTERESTS AND NOT ALLOW ITSELF TO BE USED FOR ANY PERSONAL OR PRIVATE INTEREST
5750-35690-0000 AFTER A LONG AND TEDIOUS DISCOURSE OF THESE SIX NON NATURAL THINGS AND THEIR SEVERAL RECTIFICATIONS
5750-35690-0001 OR THAT KIND OF PHYSIC WHICH CURETH BY MEDICINES WHICH APOTHECARIES MOST PART MAKE MINGLE OR SELL IN THEIR SHOPS MANY CAVIL AT THIS KIND OF PHYSIC AND HOLD IT UNNECESSARY UNPROFITABLE TO THIS OR ANY OTHER DISEASE
5750-35690-0002 BECAUSE THOSE COUNTRIES WHICH USE IT LEAST LIVE LONGEST
5750-35690-0003 RELATES OF THE ISLES OF ORCADES THE PEOPLE ARE STILL SOUND OF BODY AND MIND WITHOUT ANY USE OF PHYSIC
5750-35690-0004 DAMIANUS A GOES SAXO GRAMMATICUS AUBANUS BOHEMUS SAY THE LIKE OF THEM THAT LIVE IN NORWAY LAPLAND FINMARK BIARMIA CORELIA ALL OVER SCANDIA AND THOSE NORTHERN COUNTRIES THEY ARE MOST HEALTHFUL
5750-35690-0005 AND VERY LONG LIVED IN WHICH PLACES THERE IS NO USE AT ALL OF PHYSIC THE NAME OF IT IS NOT ONCE HEARD DITHMARUS BLESKENIUS IN HIS ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF ICELAND SIXTEEN O SEVEN
5750-35690-0006 MOST PART THEY DRINK WATER AND WHEY
5750-35690-0007 I FIND THE SAME RELATION BY LERIUS AND SOME OTHER WRITERS OF INDIANS IN AMERICA PAULUS JOVIUS IN HIS DESCRIPTION OF BRITAIN AND LEVINUS LEMNIUS OBSERVE AS MUCH OF THIS OUR ISLAND
5750-35690-0008 AND BUT LITTLE AT THIS DAY EXCEPT IT BE FOR A FEW NICE IDLE CITIZENS SURFEITING COURTIERS AND STALL FED GENTLEMEN LUBBERS THE COUNTRY PEOPLE USE KITCHEN PHYSIC
5750-35690-0009 MANY THAT DID ILL UNDER PHYSICIANS HANDS HAVE HAPPILY ESCAPED
5750-35690-0010 LEFT TO GOD AND NATURE AND THEMSELVES
5750-35690-0011 JURIDICIS MEDICIS FISCO FAS VIVERE RAPTO TIS A CORRUPT TRADE NO SCIENCE ART NO PROFESSION THE BEGINNING PRACTICE AND PROGRESS OF IT ALL IS NAUGHT FULL OF IMPOSTURE UNCERTAINTY AND DOTH GENERALLY MORE HARM THAN GOOD
5750-35690-0012 THE DEVIL HIMSELF WAS THE FIRST INVENTOR OF IT
5750-35690-0013 AND WHAT WAS APOLLO BUT THE DEVIL THE GREEKS FIRST MADE AN ART OF IT AND THEY WERE ALL DELUDED BY APOLLO'S SONS PRIESTS ORACLES IF WE MAY BELIEVE VARRO PLINY COLUMELLA MOST OF THEIR BEST MEDICINES WERE DERIVED FROM HIS ORACLES
5750-35690-0014 AESCULAPIUS HIS SON HAD HIS TEMPLES ERECTED TO HIS DEITY AND DID MANY FAMOUS CURES BUT AS LACTANTIUS HOLDS HE WAS A MAGICIAN A MERE IMPOSTOR
5750-35690-0015 PERFORMED MOST OF THEIR CURES THE FIRST THAT EVER WROTE IN PHYSIC TO ANY PURPOSE WAS HIPPOCRATES AND HIS DISCIPLE AND COMMENTATOR GALEN WHOM SCALIGER CALLS FIMBRIAM HIPPOCRATIS
5750-35690-0016 THEIR PRECEPTS CONFUSED THEIR MEDICINES OBSOLETE AND NOW MOST PART REJECTED THOSE CURES WHICH THEY DID PARACELSUS HOLDS
5750-35690-0017 THEY THEMSELVES IDIOTS AND INFANTS AS ARE ALL THEIR ACADEMICAL FOLLOWERS THE ARABIANS RECEIVED IT FROM THE GREEKS AND SO THE LATINS ADDING NEW PRECEPTS AND MEDICINES OF THEIR OWN BUT SO IMPERFECT STILL THAT THROUGH IGNORANCE OF PROFESSORS IMPOSTORS MOUNTEBANKS EMPIRICS
5750-35690-0018 DISAGREEING OF SECTARIES WHICH ARE AS MANY ALMOST AS THERE BE DISEASES ENVY COVETOUSNESS AND THE LIKE THEY DO MUCH HARM AMONGST US
5750-35690-0019 AS HE SAID OF ADRIAN MULTITUDO MEDICORUM PRINCIPEM INTERFECIT A MULTITUDE OF PHYSICIANS HATH KILLED THE EMPEROR PLUS A MEDICO QUAM A MORBO PERICULI MORE DANGER THERE IS FROM THE PHYSICIAN THAN FROM THE DISEASE
5750-35690-0020 DOTH APPROPRIATE IT TO HERSELF AND TELLS A STORY OF ONE CURTIUS A PHYSICIAN IN VENICE BECAUSE HE WAS A STRANGER AND PRACTISED AMONGST THEM THE REST OF THE PHYSICIANS DID STILL CROSS HIM IN ALL HIS PRECEPTS IF HE PRESCRIBED HOT MEDICINES THEY WOULD PRESCRIBE COLD
5750-35690-0021 MISCENTES PRO CALIDIS FRIGIDA PRO FRIGIDIS HUMIDA PRO PURGANTIBUS ASTRINGENTIA BINDERS FOR PURGATIVES OMNIA PERTURBABANT IF THE PARTY MISCARRIED CURTIUM DAMNABANT CURTIUS KILLED HIM THAT DISAGREED FROM THEM
5750-35690-0022 SOMETIMES STUMBLES THEM ALL THEY CANNOT SO MUCH AS EASE THEY KNOW NOT HOW TO JUDGE OF IT IF BY PULSES THAT DOCTRINE SOME HOLD IS WHOLLY SUPERSTITIOUS
5750-35690-0023 IS NEITHER OBSERVED NOR UNDERSTOOD OF ANY AND FOR URINE THAT IS MERETRIX MEDICORUM THE MOST DECEITFUL THING OF ALL AS FORESTUS AND SOME OTHER PHYSICIANS HAVE PROVED AT LARGE
5750-35690-0024 I HAD RATHER BELIEVE AND COMMIT MYSELF TO A MERE EMPIRIC THAN TO A MERE DOCTOR AND I CANNOT SUFFICIENTLY COMMEND THAT CUSTOM OF THE BABYLONIANS THAT HAVE NO PROFESSED PHYSICIANS BUT BRING ALL THEIR PATIENTS TO THE MARKET TO BE CURED
5750-35690-0025 WHICH HERODOTUS RELATES OF THE EGYPTIANS STRABO SARDUS AND AUBANUS BOHEMUS OF MANY OTHER NATIONS AND THOSE THAT PRESCRIBED PHYSIC
5750-35690-0026 A SECOND THE TEETH A THIRD THE HEAD
5750-35690-0027 I ACKNOWLEDGE IT A MOST NOBLE AND DIVINE SCIENCE
5750-35690-0028 AND THOSE OTHER GODS WERE CONFINED AND ADORED ALONE IN SOME PECULIAR PLACES AESCULAPIUS AND HIS TEMPLE AND ALTARS EVERYWHERE
5750-35690-0029 WITH ALL VIRTUOUS AND WISE MEN THEREFORE I HONOUR THE NAME AND CALLING AS I AM ENJOINED TO HONOUR THE PHYSICIAN FOR NECESSITY'S SAKE THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PHYSICIAN LIFTETH UP HIS HEAD AND IN THE SIGHT OF GREAT MEN HE SHALL BE ADMIRED
5750-35690-0030 BUT OF THIS NOBLE SUBJECT HOW MANY PANEGYRICS ARE WORTHILY WRITTEN
5750-35690-0031 I HAVE SAID YET ONE THING I WILL ADD THAT THIS KIND OF PHYSIC IS VERY MODERATELY AND ADVISEDLY TO BE USED
5750-35690-0032 IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD OF SUCH PURGES AS ARE UNSEASONABLY OR IMMODERATELY TAKEN THEY HAVE THEIR EXCELLENT USE IN THIS AS WELL AS MOST OTHER INFIRMITIES OF ALTERATIVES AND CORDIALS NO MAN DOUBTS BE THEY SIMPLES OR COMPOUNDS
5778-12761-0000 CONTINUATION OF FREMONT'S ACCOUNT OF THE PASSAGE THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS WE HAD HARD AND DOUBTFUL LABOR YET BEFORE US AS THE SNOW APPEARED TO BE HEAVIER WHERE THE TIMBER BEGAN FURTHER DOWN WITH FEW OPEN SPOTS
5778-12761-0001 ASCENDING A HEIGHT WE TRACED OUT THE BEST LINE WE COULD DISCOVER FOR THE NEXT DAY'S MARCH AND HAD AT LEAST THE CONSOLATION TO SEE THAT THE MOUNTAIN DESCENDED RAPIDLY THE DAY HAD BEEN ONE OF APRIL GUSTY WITH A FEW OCCASIONAL FLAKES OF SNOW
5778-12761-0002 WHICH IN THE AFTERNOON ENVELOPED THE UPPER MOUNTAINS IN CLOUDS WE WATCHED THEM ANXIOUSLY AS NOW WE DREADED A SNOW STORM SHORTLY AFTERWARDS WE HEARD THE ROLL OF THUNDER AND LOOKING TOWARD THE VALLEY FOUND IT ALL ENVELOPED IN A THUNDERSTORM
5778-12761-0003 FOR US AS CONNECTED WITH THE IDEA OF SUMMER IT HAD A SINGULAR CHARM AND WE WATCHED ITS PROGRESS WITH EXCITED FEELINGS UNTIL NEARLY SUNSET
5778-12761-0004 WHEN THE SKY CLEARED OFF BRIGHTLY AND WE SAW A SHINING LINE OF WATER DIRECTING ITS COURSE TOWARDS ANOTHER A BROADER AND LARGER SHEET WE KNEW THAT THESE COULD BE NO OTHER THAN THE SACRAMENTO AND THE BAY OF SAN FRANCISCO
5778-12761-0005 BUT AFTER OUR LONG WANDERING IN RUGGED MOUNTAINS WHERE SO FREQUENTLY WE HAD MET WITH DISAPPOINTMENTS AND WHERE THE CROSSING OF EVERY RIDGE DISPLAYED SOME UNKNOWN LAKE OR RIVER
5778-12761-0006 WE WERE YET ALMOST AFRAID TO BELIEVE THAT WE WERE AT LAST TO ESCAPE INTO THE GENIAL COUNTRY OF WHICH WE HAVE HEARD SO MANY GLOWING DESCRIPTIONS AND DREADED AGAIN TO FIND SOME VAST INTERIOR LAKE WHOSE BITTER WATERS WOULD BRING US DISAPPOINTMENT
5778-12761-0007 ON THE SOUTHERN SHORE OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE BAY COULD BE TRACED THE GLEAMING LINE WHERE ENTERED ANOTHER LARGE STREAM AND AGAIN THE BUENAVENTURA ROSE UP IN OUR MIND
5778-12761-0008 CARSON HAD ENTERED THE VALLEY ALONG THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF THE BAY BUT THE COUNTRY THEN WAS SO ENTIRELY COVERED WITH WATER FROM SNOW AND RAIN THAT HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO FORM NO CORRECT IMPRESSION OF WATERCOURSES
5778-12761-0009 WE HAD THE SATISFACTION TO KNOW THAT AT LEAST THERE WERE PEOPLE BELOW FIRES WERE LIT UP IN THE VALLEY JUST AT NIGHT APPEARING TO BE IN ANSWER TO OURS AND THESE SIGNS OF LIFE RENEWED IN SOME MEASURE THE GAYETY OF THE CAMP
5778-12761-0010 THEY APPEARED SO NEAR THAT WE JUDGED THEM TO BE AMONG THE TIMBER OF SOME OF THE NEIGHBORING RIDGES BUT HAVING THEM CONSTANTLY IN VIEW DAY AFTER DAY AND NIGHT AFTER NIGHT WE AFTERWARDS FOUND THEM TO BE FIRES THAT HAD BEEN KINDLED BY THE INDIANS AMONG THE TULARES
5778-12761-0011 ON THE SHORE OF THE BAY EIGHTY MILES DISTANT AXES AND MAULS WERE NECESSARY TODAY TO MAKE A ROAD THROUGH THE SNOW GOING AHEAD WITH CARSON TO RECONNOITRE THE ROAD WE REACHED IN THE AFTERNOON THE RIVER WHICH MADE THE OUTLET OF THE LAKE
5778-12761-0012 CARSON SPRANG OVER CLEAR ACROSS A PLACE WHERE THE STREAM WAS COMPRESSED AMONG ROCKS BUT THE PARFLECHE SOLE OF MY MOCCASIN GLANCED FROM THE ICY ROCK AND PRECIPITATED ME INTO THE RIVER
5778-12761-0013 IT WAS SOME FEW SECONDS BEFORE I COULD RECOVER MYSELF IN THE CURRENT AND CARSON THINKING ME HURT JUMPED IN AFTER ME AND WE BOTH HAD AN ICY BATH WE TRIED TO SEARCH A WHILE FOR MY GUN WHICH HAD BEEN LOST IN THE FALL
5778-12761-0014 BUT THE COLD DROVE US OUT AND MAKING A LARGE FIRE ON THE BANK AFTER WE HAD PARTIALLY DRIED OURSELVES WE WENT BACK TO MEET THE CAMP WE AFTERWARDS FOUND THAT THE GUN HAD BEEN SLUNG UNDER THE ICE WHICH LINED THE BANKS OF THE CREEK
5778-12761-0015 THE SKY WAS CLEAR AND PURE WITH A SHARP WIND FROM THE NORTHEAST AND THE THERMOMETER TWENTY BELOW THE FREEZING POINT WE CONTINUED DOWN THE SOUTH FACE OF THE MOUNTAIN OUR ROAD LEADING OVER DRY GROUND WE WERE ABLE TO AVOID THE SNOW ALMOST ENTIRELY
5778-12761-0016 IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING WE STRUCK A FOOT PATH WHICH WE WERE GENERALLY ABLE TO KEEP AND THE GROUND WAS SOFT TO OUR ANIMALS FEET BEING SANDY OR COVERED WITH MOULD GREEN GRASS BEGAN TO MAKE ITS APPEARANCE
5778-12761-0017 AND OCCASIONALLY WE PASSED A HILL SCATTERINGLY COVERED WITH IT THE CHARACTER OF THE FOREST CONTINUED THE SAME AND AMONG THE TREES THE PINE WITH SHARP LEAVES AND VERY LARGE CONES WAS ABUNDANT SOME OF THEM BEING NOBLE TREES
5778-12761-0018 WE MEASURED ONE THAT HAD TEN FEET DIAMETER THOUGH THE HEIGHT WAS NOT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FEET ALL ALONG THE RIVER WAS A ROARING TORRENT ITS FALL VERY GREAT AND DESCENDING WITH A RAPIDITY TO WHICH WE HAD LONG BEEN STRANGERS
5778-12761-0019 TO OUR GREAT PLEASURE OAK TREES APPEARED ON THE RIDGE AND SOON BECAME VERY FREQUENT ON THESE I REMARKED UNUSUALLY GREAT QUANTITIES OF MISTLETOE THE OPPOSITE MOUNTAIN SIDE WAS VERY STEEP AND CONTINUOUS
5778-12761-0020 UNBROKEN BY RAVINES AND COVERED WITH PINES AND SNOW WHILE ON THE SIDE WE WERE TRAVELLING INNUMERABLE RIVULETS POURED DOWN FROM THE RIDGE
5778-12761-0021 CONTINUING ON WE HALTED A MOMENT AT ONE OF THESE RIVULETS TO ADMIRE SOME BEAUTIFUL EVERGREEN TREES RESEMBLING LIVE OAK WHICH SHADED THE LITTLE STREAM
5778-12761-0022 THEY WERE FORTY TO FIFTY FEET HIGH AND TWO IN DIAMETER WITH A UNIFORM TUFTED TOP AND THE SUMMER GREEN OF THEIR BEAUTIFUL FOLIAGE WITH THE SINGING BIRDS AND THE SWEET SUMMER WIND WHICH WAS WHIRLING ABOUT THE DRY OAK LEAVES
5778-12761-0023 NEARLY INTOXICATED US WITH DELIGHT AND WE HURRIED ON FILLED WITH EXCITEMENT TO ESCAPE ENTIRELY FROM THE HORRID REGION OF INHOSPITABLE SNOW TO THE PERPETUAL SPRING OF THE SACRAMENTO
5778-12761-0024 I STARTED AHEAD THIS MORNING WITH A PARTY OF EIGHT CONSISTING WITH MYSELF
5778-12761-0025 AND JACOB WE TOOK WITH US SOME OF THE BEST ANIMALS AND MY INTENTION WAS TO PROCEED AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE TO THE HOUSE OF MISTER SUTTER AND RETURN TO MEET THE PARTY WITH A SUPPLY OF PROVISIONS AND FRESH ANIMALS
5778-12761-0026 NEAR NIGHT FALL WE DESCENDED INTO THE STEEP RAVINE OF A HANDSOME CREEK THIRTY FEET WIDE AND I WAS ENGAGED IN GETTING THE HORSES UP THE OPPOSITE HILL WHEN I HEARD A SHOUT FROM CARSON WHO HAD GONE AHEAD A FEW HUNDRED YARDS
5778-12761-0027 LIFE YET SAID HE AS HE CAME UP LIFE YET I HAVE FOUND A HILLSIDE SPRINKLED WITH GRASS ENOUGH FOR THE NIGHT
5778-12761-0028 WE DROVE ALONG OUR HORSES AND ENCAMPED AT THE PLACE ABOUT DARK AND THERE WAS JUST ROOM ENOUGH TO MAKE A PLACE FOR SHELTER ON THE EDGE OF THE STREAM THREE HORSES WERE LOST TODAY PROVEAU
5778-12761-0029 A FINE YOUNG HORSE FROM THE COLUMBIA BELONGING TO CHARLES TOWNS AND ANOTHER INDIAN HORSE WHICH CARRIED OUR COOKING UTENSILS THE TWO FORMER GAVE OUT AND THE LATTER STRAYED OFF INTO THE WOODS AS WE REACHED THE CAMP
5778-12761-0030 CARSON AND I CLIMBED ONE OF THE NEAREST MOUNTAINS THE FOREST LAND STILL EXTENDED AHEAD AND THE VALLEY APPEARED AS FAR AS EVER
5778-12761-0031 WE BEGAN TO BE UNEASY AT DEROSIER'S ABSENCE FEARING HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BEWILDERED IN THE WOODS CHARLES TOWNS WHO HAD NOT YET RECOVERED HIS MIND WENT TO SWIM IN THE RIVER AS IF IT WAS SUMMER AND THE STREAM PLACID
5778-12761-0032 WHEN IT WAS A COLD MOUNTAIN TORRENT FOAMING AMONG THE ROCKS
5778-12761-0033 HE CAME IN AND SITTING DOWN BY THE FIRE BEGAN TO TELL US WHERE HE HAD BEEN HE IMAGINED HE HAD BEEN GONE SEVERAL DAYS AND THOUGHT WE WERE STILL AT THE CAMP WHERE HE HAD LEFT US AND WE WERE PAINED TO SEE THAT HIS MIND WAS DERANGED
5778-12761-0034 IT APPEARED THAT HE HAD BEEN LOST IN THE MOUNTAIN AND HUNGER AND FATIGUE JOINED TO WEAKNESS OF BODY AND FEAR OF PERISHING IN THE MOUNTAINS HAD CRAZED HIM THE TIMES WERE SEVERE WHEN STOUT MEN LOST THEIR MINDS FROM EXTREMITY OF SUFFERING
5778-12761-0035 WHEN HORSES DIED AND WHEN MULES AND HORSES READY TO DIE OF STARVATION WERE KILLED FOR FOOD YET THERE WAS NO MURMURING OR HESITATION IN THE MEANTIME MISTER PREUSS CONTINUED ON DOWN THE RIVER
5778-12761-0036 AND UNAWARE THAT WE HAD ENCAMPED SO EARLY IN THE DAY WAS LOST WHEN NIGHT ARRIVED AND HE DID NOT COME IN WE BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO MAKE ANY SEARCH
5778-12761-0037 WE FOLLOWED MISTER PREUSS'S TRAIL FOR A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE ALONG THE RIVER UNTIL WE REACHED A PLACE WHERE HE HAD DESCENDED TO THE STREAM BELOW AND ENCAMPED HERE WE SHOUTED AND FIRED GUNS BUT RECEIVED NO ANSWER
5778-12761-0038 AND WE CONCLUDED THAT HE HAD PUSHED ON DOWN THE STREAM I DETERMINED TO KEEP OUT FROM THE RIVER ALONG WHICH IT WAS NEARLY IMPRACTICABLE TO TRAVEL WITH ANIMALS UNTIL IT SHOULD FORM A VALLEY
5778-12761-0039 AND OAKS BECAME THE PRINCIPAL TREES OF THE FOREST AMONG THESE THE PREVAILING TREE WAS THE EVERGREEN OAK WHICH BY WAY OF DISTINCTION WE SHALL CALL THE LIVE OAK
5778-12761-0040 AND WITH THESE OCCURRED FREQUENTLY A NEW SPECIES OF OAK BEARING A LONG SLENDER ACORN FROM AN INCH TO AN INCH AND A HALF IN LENGTH WHICH WE NOW BEGAN TO SEE FORMED THE PRINCIPAL VEGETABLE FOOD OF THE INHABITANTS OF THIS REGION
5778-12761-0041 IN A SHORT DISTANCE WE CROSSED A LITTLE RIVULET WHERE WERE TWO OLD HUTS AND NEAR BY WERE HEAPS OF ACORN HULLS THE GROUND ROUND ABOUT WAS VERY RICH COVERED WITH AN EXUBERANT SWARD OF GRASS
5778-12761-0042 AND WE SAT DOWN FOR A WHILE IN THE SHADE OF THE OAKS TO LET THE ANIMALS FEED WE REPEATED OUR SHOUTS FOR MISTER PREUSS AND THIS TIME WE WERE GRATIFIED WITH AN ANSWER THE VOICE GREW RAPIDLY NEARER ASCENDING FROM THE RIVER
5778-12761-0043 BUT WHEN WE EXPECTED TO SEE HIM EMERGE IT CEASED ENTIRELY WE HAD CALLED UP SOME STRAGGLING INDIAN THE FIRST WE HAD MET ALTHOUGH FOR TWO DAYS BACK WE HAD SEEN TRACKS
5778-12761-0044 WHO MISTAKING US FOR HIS FELLOWS HAD BEEN ONLY UNDECEIVED BY GETTING CLOSE UP IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PLEASANT TO WITNESS HIS ASTONISHMENT HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE FRIGHTENED HAD SOME OF THE OLD MOUNTAIN SPIRITS THEY ARE SO MUCH AFRAID OF
5778-12761-0045 SUDDENLY APPEARED IN HIS PATH IGNORANT OF THE CHARACTER OF THESE PEOPLE WE HAD NOW ADDITIONAL CAUSE OF UNEASINESS IN REGARD TO MISTER PREUSS HE HAD NO ARMS WITH HIM AND WE BEGAN TO THINK HIS CHANCE DOUBTFUL
5778-12761-0046 AT ONE OF THESE ORCHARD GROUNDS WE ENCAMPED ABOUT NOON TO MAKE AN EFFORT FOR MISTER PREUSS ONE MAN TOOK HIS WAY ALONG A SPUR LEADING INTO THE RIVER IN HOPE TO CROSS HIS TRAIL AND ANOTHER TOOK OUR OWN BACK
5778-12761-0047 BOTH WERE VOLUNTEERS AND TO THE SUCCESSFUL MAN WAS PROMISED A PAIR OF PISTOLS NOT AS A REWARD BUT AS A TOKEN OF GRATITUDE FOR A SERVICE WHICH WOULD FREE US ALL FROM MUCH ANXIETY
5778-12761-0048 AT THE END OF FOUR DAYS MISTER PREUSS SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED HIS FRIENDS BY WALKING INTO CAMP HE HAD LIVED ON ROOTS AND ACORNS AND WAS IN THE LAST STAGES OF EXHAUSTION
5778-12761-0049 SHORTLY THE ADVANCE PARTY REACHED SUTTER'S FORT WHERE THEY RECEIVED THE MOST HOSPITABLE TREATMENT
5778-54535-0000 HE MEANT TO HAVE IT ONE OF THE BEST IN THE WORLD SO HE CALLED AN OFFICER INTO HIS COUNCIL CHAMBER AND SAID NOW TAKE PLENTY OF TIME TO LOOK ABOUT IN THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES HAVE ALL THE MEN YOU WANT TO HELP YOU
5778-54535-0001 BUT FIND ME SOMEWHERE AN ENGINEER THAT WILL LAY OUT A PERFECT RAILROAD LINE MEN APPOINTED BY THIS COLONEL TRAVELED SOME MONTHS THEY VISITED MANY CITIES WROTE LETTERS AND ASKED ADVICE THEN THE COLONEL WENT BACK TO THE EMPEROR AND SAID
5778-54535-0002 THE MAN YOU NEED TO DO THIS PIECE OF WORK LIVES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WHAT'S HIS NAME ASKED NICOLAS HE IS MAJOR GEORGE WASHINGTON WHISTLER HE IS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE CITY IN WHICH HE LIVES LOWELL MASSACHUSETTS
5778-54535-0003 HE IS A DISTINGUISHED ARMY OFFICER AND A FINE ENGINEER HE IS NAMED FOR A GREAT OFFICER ANSWERED NICOLAS REMEMBERING OUR GENERAL WASHINGTON AND HE DISPATCHED A LETTER TO THE LOWELL ENGINEER
5778-54535-0004 THE MAJOR MADE HASTE TO START FOR RUSSIA BECAUSE THE HONOR WAS GREAT AND THE PAYMENT WOULD BE GENEROUS HE LEFT HIS BOYS AND HIS WIFE BEHIND BECAUSE HE DID NOT KNOW JUST HOW COMFORTABLE HE COULD MAKE THEM IN THE FAR OFF COUNTRY
5778-54535-0005 BUT HE TOLD THE BOYS TO BE GOOD AND TO MIND THEIR MOTHER THESE BOYS WERE NAMED JAMES MC NEILL WILLIAM AND CHARLES THEIR MOTHER WAS A FINE WOMAN BUT SOMETIMES THEY WISHED SHE WOULD NOT BE QUITE SO STRICT
5778-54535-0006 SHE USED TO SAY ON SATURDAY AFTERNOONS COME BOYS EMPTY YOUR POCKETS AND GATHER UP YOUR TOYS WE WILL PUT THE KNIVES AND MARBLES AWAY AND GET READY FOR SUNDAY ALL DAY SUNDAY THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO READ ANY BOOK BUT THE BIBLE
5778-54535-0007 BUT JAMES LIKED THE STORIES HE FOUND THERE AND WHEN HE WAS ONLY NINE COULD SAY ALMOST HALF THE BIBLE BY HEART JAMES WAS THE OLDEST IN THE FAMILY HE WAS BORN IN LOWELL AND WAS SUCH A CUNNING BABY THAT EVERYBODY WANTED HIS PICTURE
5778-54535-0008 ONE OF HIS UNCLES WHO LOVED HIM DEARLY USED TO SAY IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS THIS WAS A GREAT ENGLISH PAINTER WHO HAD DIED YEARS BEFORE COME OUT OF HIS GRAVE TO PAINT JIMMIE ASLEEP
5778-54535-0009 JIMMIE HAD DELICATE FEATURES AND LONG SILKY BROWN CURLS THAT HUNG ABOUT HIS FACE IN AMONG THESE WAS ONE WHITE LOCK THAT DROPPED STRAIGHT DOWN OVER HIS FOREHEAD THIS LOOKED LIKE A TINY FEATHER
5778-54535-0010 MORE THAN ALL HIS PLAYTHINGS HE LIKED A PENCIL AND PAPER FROM THE TIME HE COULD SCRIBBLE AT ALL HE DREW PICTURES OF EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING IN SIGHT
5778-54535-0011 THESE PICTURES WERE VERY GOOD AND WHEN HE WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO GO TO SCHOOL THE OTHER CHILDREN WERE APT TO ASK HIM TO MAKE ANIMALS AND BIRDS FOR THEM ON THE BLACKBOARD MAJOR WHISTLER SOON SENT FOR HIS FAMILY TO JOIN HIM IN RUSSIA
5778-54535-0012 IT WAS A LONG HARD VOYAGE THERE AND POOR LITTLE CHARLIE DIED ON THE WAY THE TWO OTHER BOYS WERE BETTER SAILORS AND WERE AS WELL AS COULD BE WHEN THEY MET THEIR FATHER THEY DID ENJOY THE STRANGE SIGHTS IN SAINT PETERSBURG
5778-54535-0013 THEY WERE NOT LONG IN GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH THE LITTLE RUSSIAN CHILDREN OR IN LEARNING THE LANGUAGE THEY WENT SKATING DRESSED IN HANDSOME FURS THEY LEARNED THE FOLK AND FANCY DANCES JOINED IN THE WINTER SPORTS AND VOTED RUSSIA A FINE COUNTRY
5778-54535-0014 STILL THEIR PARENTS DID NOT LET THEM FORGET THEY WERE LITTLE AMERICANS THE CLIMATE DID NOT AGREE WITH JAMES AND EVERY TIME HE CAUGHT COLD HE HAD TOUCHES OF RHEUMATISM SO THAT OFTEN HE HAD TO STAY IN THE HOUSE AND HAVE HIS FEET PUT IN HOT WATER
5778-54535-0015 INSTEAD OF MAKING A FUSS ABOUT THIS HE USED TO CALL FOR PENCIL AND PAPER AND PRACTISE DRAWING FEET UNTIL HE COULD MAKE VERY PERFECT ONES MAJOR WHISTLER SENT HIM TO THE ART ACADEMY IN SAINT PETERSBURG WHERE HE WAS PRAISED BY HIS TEACHERS
5778-54535-0016 THAT OLD TIRESOME RHEUMATISM KEPT BOTHERING HIM AND BY AND BY HE HAD A LONG RHEUMATIC FEVER
5778-54535-0017 HE WAS A DEAR PATIENT BOY HOWEVER AND AFTERWARDS DECLARED HE WAS ALMOST GLAD HE HAD IT BECAUSE SOME ONE WHO PITIED THE SMALL INVALID SENT HIM A BOOK OF HOGARTH'S ENGRAVINGS
5778-54535-0018 I WANT YOU TO BE SURE AND REMEMBER ABOUT THIS GENTLENESS AND PATIENCE BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS OLDER PEOPLE OFTEN ACCUSED HIM OF BEING CROSS AND RUDE BUT AT THIS TIME I AM SURE NO ONE COULD HAVE BEEN NICER
5778-54535-0019 JAMES WAS VERY CAREFUL OF HIS MOTHER TOO ONE EVENING SHE HAD TAKEN THE BOYS IN A CARRIAGE TO SEE A BIG ILLUMINATION BANDS WERE PLAYING AND ROCKETS FLYING
5778-54535-0020 THE HORSES NEXT THEIR CARRIAGE WERE FRIGHTENED AND REARED AND PLUNGED AS IF THEY WOULD HIT THE WHISTLER PARTY JAMES SHOVED HIS MOTHER DOWN ON THE SEAT BEHIND HIM AND STANDING IN FRONT OF HER BEAT THE HORSES BACK FROM THEM
5778-54535-0021 HE ALWAYS WAS AS POLITE TO HER AS IF SHE WERE THE EMPEROR'S WIFE THE MAJOR WORKED TOO HARD ON THE GREAT RAILWAY AND DIED BEFORE JAMES WAS FIFTEEN
5778-54535-0022 THE EMPEROR WAS FOND OF THE TWO BOYS AND WANTED THEM TO STAY ON IN RUSSIA AND BE TRAINED IN THE SCHOOL FOR PAGES OF THE COURT BUT THEIR MOTHER SAID THEY MUST GROW UP IN AMERICA AND HURRIED BACK TO HER OWN LAND
5778-54535-0023 SHE DID NOT HAVE MUCH MONEY TO SPEND BUT THOUGHT JAMES SHOULD GO TO WEST POINT TO GET THE MILITARY TRAINING HIS FATHER HAD HAD AT THIS ACADEMY HE FOUND HE DID NOT LIKE TO DRAW MAPS AND FORTS NEARLY AS WELL AS HE DID HUMAN FIGURES AND FACES
5778-54535-0024 ONCE WHEN HE HAD BEEN SENT TO WASHINGTON TO DRAW MAPS FOR THE COAST SURVEY HE FORGOT WHAT HE WAS ABOUT AND FILLED UP THE NICE WHITE MARGINS WITH PERT LITTLE DANCING FOLKS HE WAS WELL SCOLDED FOR THIS I CAN TELL YOU
5778-54535-0025 JAMES WAS A TALL HANDSOME YOUNG FELLOW AT THIS TIME AND LIKED TO GO ABOUT TO DANCING PARTIES IN THE EVENING HE EARNED VERY LITTLE MAKING MAPS AND COULD NOT AFFORD TO BUY THE REAL NARROW TAILED COAT WHICH WAS PROPER
5778-54535-0026 SO HE USED TO TAKE HIS FROCK COAT THAT HE WORE ALL DAY AND PIN IT BACK TO LOOK LIKE A DRESS COAT AND START OFF FOR BIG BALLS WHERE NOBODY WAS MUCH SHOCKED BECAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS DOING DROLL THINGS AND WAS SO LIVELY THAT HE WAS WELCOME IN ANY DRESS
5778-54535-0027 AND THE MAP DRAWING HAD GROWN SO TIRESOME THAT JAMES HAD GIVEN UP WEST POINT AND SETTLED DOWN TO PAINTING AND ETCHING IN PARIS HE HAD DECIDED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE WORLD WHICH SUITED HIM BUT THE LIFE OF AN ARTIST
5778-54535-0028 HE WORKED QUITE STEADILY AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO SAY I THINK YOUNG WHISTLER IS GOING TO DO GREAT THINGS SOME DAY BUT SUDDENLY HE PACKED UP AND WENT TO LONDON
5778-54535-0029 IN THIS CITY HE WAS PRAISED EVEN MORE BUT HE DID NOT SELL ENOUGH PICTURES TO PAY HIS BILLS AND ONCE WHEN HE HAD KEPT MEN WAITING A LONG TIME FOR MONEY THAT HE OWED THEM OFFICERS CAME AND TOOK EVERYTHING AWAY BUT HIS PICTURES
5778-54535-0030 THE ROOM LOOKED SO BARE AND HOMELY THAT WHISTLER PAINTED A VERY GOOD IMITATION OF FURNITURE ROUND THE WALLS OF HIS ROOM SO GOOD IN FACT THAT A RICH MAN WHO CAME TO LOOK AT THE PICTURES SAT DOWN IN ONE OF THE IMITATION CHAIRS AND FOUND HIMSELF ON THE FLOOR
5778-54535-0031 IT WAS FORTUNATE THAT JAMES COULD GO A LONG TIME WITHOUT FOOD FOR IT TOOK NEARLY ALL HE COULD EARN FROM HIS PICTURES TO BUY PAINT AND CANVAS FOR OTHERS I DARE SAY THAT QUITE OFTEN WHEN IT WAS SAID
5778-54535-0032 JAMES MC NEILL WHISTLER IS GROWING RUDE AND CROSS THE REAL TRUTH OF THE MATTER WAS THAT JAMES MC NEILL WHISTLER WAS HUNGRY AND WORRIED
5778-54535-0033 HOWEVER HE BEGAN TO MAKE MONEY AT LAST AND JUST AS LIFE SEEMED BRIGHT AN ART CRITIC MISTER JOHN RUSKIN DECLARED THAT THE WHISTLER PICTURES WHICH WERE BEING BOUGHT AT BIG PRICES WERE POOR VERY POOR
5778-54535-0034 MISTER RUSKIN SPOKE AND WHAT WAS WORSE PRINTED HIS OPINION I NEVER EXPECTED HE WROTE TO HEAR A COXCOMB ASK TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS FOR FLINGING A POT OF PAINT IN THE PUBLIC'S FACE
5778-54535-0035 WELL IT DID NOT LOOK FOR A WHILE AS IF THERE WAS ANY MORE GOOD LUCK IN THE WORLD FOR JAMES WHISTLER HE DID NOT LOSE ANY TIME IN GETTING A LAWYER TO SUE MISTER RUSKIN FOR SPOILING THE SALE OF HIS PICTURES
5778-54535-0036 THERE WAS A TRIAL IN LONDON AND THE COURT ROOM WAS CROWDED SOME WERE THERE BECAUSE THEY ALREADY OWNED WHISTLER PICTURES AND WANTED TO FIND OUT IF THEY HAD PAID GOOD MONEY FOR BAD PICTURES OTHERS BECAUSE THEY WERE WARM FRIENDS OF THE ARTIST OR THE CRITIC
5778-54535-0037 BUT EVEN MORE MEN AND WOMEN WENT TO HEAR THE SHARP QUESTIONS OF THE LAWYERS AND THE CLEVER ANSWERS OF RUSKIN AND WHISTLER WHISTLER WON THE CASE WHEN THE JUDGE AWARDED ONE FARTHING FOR DAMAGES THIS IS ONLY A QUARTER OF A CENT IN OUR MONEY
5778-54535-0038 WHISTLER LAUGHED AND HUNG THE ENGLISH FARTHING ON HIS WATCH CHAIN FOR A CHARM MISTER RUSKIN HAD TO PAY THE COSTS OF THE TRIAL WHICH HAD MOUNTED UP TO NINETEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS SOME OF HIS FRIENDS INSISTED ON RAISING THAT SUM FOR HIM
5778-54535-0039 ONE OF THEM SAID IT WAS WORTH NINETEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS TO HAVE HEARD THE TALK THAT WENT ON IN THE COURT ROOM LATER MISTER WHISTLER RECEIVED MUCH MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS FOR A SINGLE PICTURE
5778-54535-0040 TWO FAMOUS ONES OF WHICH WE OFTEN SEE PRINTS ARE PORTRAIT OF MY MOTHER AND THE SCOTCH WRITER CARLYLE JAMES WHISTLER'S MOTHER LIVED TO BE AN OLD WOMAN AS ONE CAN GUESS FROM THE PICTURE
5778-54535-0041 AND HER SON LOVED HER JUST AS DEARLY AS HE DID WHEN HE BEAT THE PRANCING HORSES AWAY FROM HER IN RUSSIA THE FRENCH NATION BOUGHT THIS PORTRAIT AND IT HANGS IN THE LUXEMBOURG MUSEUM PARIS
5778-54535-0042 THE SCOTCH PEOPLE WANTED TO OWN THE PORTRAIT OF CARLYLE AND THE CITY OF GLASGOW WAS GLAD TO PAY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR IT MISTER WHISTLER MARRIED A WOMAN WHO WAS HERSELF AN ARTIST AND SHE WAS VERY PROUD OF HIM
5778-54535-0043 THE DUET ONE OF HIS PICTURES SHOWS HIS WIFE AND HER SISTER AT THE PIANO TWO PORTRAITS BY THIS AMERICAN ARTIST HANG IN THE BOSTON MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS BUT MOST OF THEM ARE OWNED IN ENGLAND
5778-54535-0044 JAMES WHISTLER WAS ALWAYS KIND TO YOUNG ARTISTS AND LIKED TO HAVE THEM SIT BY HIM WHILE HE WORKED THEY WERE VERY PROUD TO BE NOTICED BY HIM FOR LONG BEFORE HE DIED HE HAD RECEIVED ALL KINDS OF HONORS AND MEDALS FROM FOREIGN ACADEMIES
5778-54535-0045 AND FRANCE GERMANY AND ITALY MADE HIM AN OFFICER OF THE LEGION OF HONOR A COMMANDER AND A CHEVALIER
5778-54535-0046 HE LOVED ART SO WELL THAT HE MADE WATER COLORS PASTELS ETCHINGS AND LITHOGRAPHS AS WELL AS OIL PAINTINGS HE DID NOT GET HIS FAME WITHOUT MUCH HARD WORK
5778-54535-0047 YOU REMEMBER HOW MANY TIMES HE COPIED HIS OWN FOOT WHEN HE WAS A CHILD WELL HE WAS JUST AS PATIENT AND THOROUGH WHEN HE WAS OLDER FOR A LONG TIME HE MADE A PRACTICE OF DRAWING A PICTURE OF HIMSELF EVERY NIGHT BEFORE HE WENT TO BED
5778-54535-0048 HE TRAVELED A GREAT DEAL PAINTING VIEWS IN MANY COUNTRIES AND STUDYING THE PICTURES OF OTHER ARTISTS BUT HOGARTH WAS HIS FAVORITE AND IT IS INTERESTING TO KNOW THAT JAMES MC NEILL WHISTLER LIES BURIED VERY NEAR HOGARTH IN LONDON
5808-48608-0000 WHEN IT WAS THE THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVENTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT IBRAHIM SON OF AL MAHDI CONTINUED NOW WHEN THE HOUSEMASTER HEARD MY NAME HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND SAID
5808-48608-0001 INDEED I WONDERED THAT SUCH GIFTS SHOULD BELONG TO ANY BUT THE LIKE OF THEE AND FORTUNE HATH DONE ME A GOOD TURN FOR WHICH I CANNOT THANK HER TOO MUCH BUT HAPLY THIS IS A DREAM FOR HOW COULD I HOPE THAT ONE OF THE CALIPHATE HOUSE SHOULD VISIT MY HUMBLE HOME
5808-48608-0002 AND CAROUSE WITH ME THIS NIGHT
5808-48608-0003 AS TO THE CAUSE OF MY VISIT IN THE MOST COURTEOUS TERMS SO I TOLD HIM THE WHOLE AFFAIR FIRST AND LAST HIDING NAUGHT AND SAID TO HIM NOW AS TO THE FOOD I HAVE HAD MY WILL BUT OF THE HAND AND WRIST I HAVE STILL TO WIN MY WISH
5808-48608-0004 QUOTH HE THOU SHALT HAVE THY DESIRE OF THE HAND AND WRIST ALSO INSHALLAH THEN SAID HE TO THE SLAVE GIRL HO SUCH AN ONE BID SUCH AN ONE COME DOWN AND HE CALLED HIS SLAVE GIRLS DOWN ONE BY ONE AND SHOWED THEM TO ME
5808-48608-0005 BUT I SAW NOT MY MISTRESS AMONG THEM AND HE SAID O MY LORD THERE IS NONE LEFT SAVE MY MOTHER AND SISTER BUT BY ALLAH I MUST NEEDS HAVE THEM ALSO DOWN AND SHOW THEM TO THEE SO I MARVELLED AT HIS COURTESY AND LARGE HEARTEDNESS AND SAID
5808-48608-0006 MAY I BE THY SACRIFICE BEGIN WITH THE SISTER AND HE ANSWERED WITH JOY AND GOODWILL SO SHE CAME DOWN AND HE SHOWED ME HER HAND AND BEHOLD SHE WAS THE OWNER OF THE HAND AND WRIST QUOTH I
5808-48608-0007 SEEKETH IN MARRIAGE MY SISTER SUCH AN ONE AND I CALL YOU TO WITNESS THAT I GIVE HER IN WEDLOCK TO HIM AND THAT HE HATH SETTLED UPON HER TEN THOUSAND DINARS AND HE SAID TO ME I GIVE THEE MY SISTER IN MARRIAGE AT THE PORTION AFORESAID
5808-48608-0008 I CONSENT ANSWERED I AND AM HEREWITH CONTENT WHEREUPON HE GAVE ONE OF THE BAGS TO HER AND THE OTHER TO THE WITNESSES AND SAID TO ME O OUR LORD I DESIRE TO ADORN A CHAMBER FOR THEE WHERE THOU MAYST SLEEP WITH THY WIFE
5808-48608-0009 BUT I WAS ABASHED AT HIS GENEROSITY AND WAS ASHAMED TO LIE WITH HER IN HIS HOUSE SO I SAID EQUIP HER AND SEND HER TO MY PLACE
5808-48608-0010 AND BY THY BEING O COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL HE SENT ME WITH HER SUCH AN EQUIPAGE THAT MY HOUSE FOR ALL ITS GREATNESS WAS TOO STRAIT TO HOLD IT AND I BEGOT ON HER THIS BOY THAT STANDETH IN THY PRESENCE
5808-48608-0011 THEN AL MAAMUN MARVELLED AT THE MAN'S GENEROSITY AND SAID GIFTED OF ALLAH IS HE NEVER HEARD I OF HIS LIKE AND HE BADE IBRAHIM BIN AL MAHDI BRING HIM TO COURT THAT HE MIGHT SEE HIM HE BROUGHT HIM AND THE CALIPH CONVERSED WITH HIM
5808-48608-0012 AND HIS WIT AND GOOD BREEDING SO PLEASED HIM THAT HE MADE HIM ONE OF HIS CHIEF OFFICERS AND ALLAH IS THE GIVER THE BESTOWER MEN ALSO RELATE THE TALE OF THE WOMAN WHOSE HANDS WERE CUT OFF FOR GIVING ALMS TO THE POOR
5808-48608-0013 A CERTAIN KING ONCE MADE PROCLAMATION TO THE PEOPLE OF HIS REALM SAYING IF ANY OF YOU GIVE ALMS OF AUGHT I WILL VERILY AND ASSUREDLY CUT OFF HIS HAND
5808-48608-0014 WHEREFORE ALL THE PEOPLE ABSTAINED FROM ALMS DEED AND NONE COULD GIVE ANYTHING TO ANY ONE NOW IT CHANCED THAT ONE DAY A BEGGAR ACCOSTED A CERTAIN WOMAN AND INDEED HUNGER WAS SORE UPON HIM AND SAID TO HER
5808-48608-0015 GIVE ME AN ALMS AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY WHEN IT WAS THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHTH NIGHT SHE SAID
5808-48608-0016 IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT QUOTH THE BEGGAR TO THE WOMAN GIVE ME AN ALMS HOWEVER SMALL BUT SHE ANSWERED HIM HOW CAN I GIVE THEE AUGHT WHEN THE KING CUTTETH OFF THE HANDS OF ALL WHO GIVE ALMS

5808-48608-0060 SO I TOLD HIM THE WHOLE STORY AND HE WEPT AND SAID BY ALLAH HADDEST THOU TOLD ME THE FACT AT FIRST I HAD NOT PRESSED THEE
5808-54425-0000 FIVE YEARS IS BUT A SHORT TIME IN THE LIFE OF A MAN AND YET MANY THINGS MAY HAPPEN THEREIN FOR INSTANCE THE WHOLE WAY OF A FAMILY'S LIFE MAY BE CHANGED GOOD NATURES MAY BE MADE INTO BAD ONES
5808-54425-0001 AND OUT OF A SOUL OF FAITH GROW A SPIRIT OF UNBELIEF THE INDEPENDENCE OF RESPECTABILITY MAY HARDEN INTO THE INSOLENCE OF DEFIANCE AND THE SENSITIVE CHEEK OF MODESTY INTO THE BRAZEN FACE OF SHAMELESSNESS
5808-54425-0002 IT MAY BE TRUE THAT THE HABITS OF YEARS ARE HARD TO CHANGE BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE OF THE FIRST SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN YEARS OF A YOUNG PERSON'S LIFE ELSE KITTY HAMILTON AND JOE COULD NOT SO EASILY HAVE BECOME WHAT THEY WERE
5808-54425-0003 IT HAD TAKEN BARELY FIVE YEARS TO ACCOMPLISH AN ENTIRE METAMORPHOSIS OF THEIR CHARACTERS IN JOE'S CASE EVEN A SHORTER TIME WAS NEEDED HE WAS SO READY TO GO DOWN THAT IT NEEDED BUT A GENTLE PUSH TO START HIM AND ONCE STARTED
5808-54425-0004 THERE WAS NOTHING WITHIN HIM TO HOLD HIM BACK FROM THE DEPTHS FOR HIS WILL WAS AS FLABBY AS HIS CONSCIENCE AND HIS PRIDE WHICH STANDS TO SOME MEN FOR CONSCIENCE HAD NO DEFINITE AIM OR DIRECTION
5808-54425-0005 HATTIE STERLING HAD GIVEN HIM BOTH HIS GREATEST IMPULSE FOR EVIL AND FOR GOOD SHE HAD AT FIRST GIVEN HIM HIS GENTLE PUSH BUT WHEN SHE SAW THAT HIS COLLAPSE WOULD LOSE HER A FAITHFUL AND USEFUL SLAVE
5808-54425-0006 SHE HAD SOUGHT TO CHECK HIS COURSE HER THREAT OF THE SEVERANCE OF THEIR RELATIONS HAD HELD HIM UP FOR A LITTLE TIME AND SHE BEGAN TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS SAFE AGAIN HE WENT BACK TO THE WORK HE HAD NEGLECTED DRANK MODERATELY
5808-54425-0007 AND ACTED IN MOST THINGS AS A SOUND SENSIBLE BEING THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WENT DOWN AGAIN AND WENT DOWN BADLY SHE KEPT HER PROMISE AND THREW HIM OVER
5808-54425-0008 THEN HE BECAME A HANGER ON AT THE CLUBS A GENTEEL LOAFER HE USED TO SAY IN HIS SOBER MOMENTS THAT AT LAST HE WAS ONE OF THE BOYS THAT SADNESS HAD SPOKEN OF HE DID NOT WORK
5808-54425-0009 BUT HE SOON TIRED OF BEING SEPARATED FROM HATTIE AND STRAIGHTENED UP AGAIN AFTER SOME DEMUR SHE RECEIVED HIM UPON HIS FORMER FOOTING IT WAS ONLY FOR A FEW MONTHS HE FELL AGAIN FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS THIS HAD HAPPENED INTERMITTENTLY
5808-54425-0010 FINALLY HE TOOK A TURN FOR THE BETTER THAT ENDURED SO LONG THAT HATTIE STERLING AGAIN GAVE HIM HER FAITH THEN THE WOMAN MADE HER MISTAKE SHE WARMED TO HIM SHE SHOWED HIM THAT SHE WAS PROUD OF HIM
5808-54425-0011 HE WENT FORTH AT ONCE TO CELEBRATE HIS VICTORY HE DID NOT RETURN TO HER FOR THREE DAYS THEN HE WAS BATTERED UNKEMPT AND THICK OF SPEECH SHE LOOKED AT HIM IN SILENT CONTEMPT FOR A WHILE AS HE SAT NURSING HIS ACHING HEAD
5808-54425-0012 SHE SAID FINALLY WITH CUTTING SCORN YOU OUGHT TO BE PUT UNDER A GLASS CASE AND PLACED ON EXHIBITION HE GROANED AND HIS HEAD SUNK LOWER A DRUNKEN MAN IS ALWAYS DISARMED
5808-54425-0013 HIS HELPLESSNESS INSTEAD OF INSPIRING HER WITH PITY INFLAMED HER WITH AN UNFEELING ANGER THAT BURST FORTH IN A VOLUME OF TAUNTS
5808-54425-0014 NO ONE HAD EVER LOOKED AT YOU UNTIL I PICKED YOU UP AND YOU VE BEEN STRUTTING AROUND EVER SINCE
5808-54425-0015 AND NOW THIS IS THE WAY YOU PAY ME BACK DRUNK HALF THE TIME AND HALF DRUNK THE REST WELL YOU KNOW WHAT I TOLD YOU THE LAST TIME YOU GOT LOADED I MEAN IT TOO YOU RE NOT THE ONLY STAR IN SIGHT SEE SHE LAUGHED MEANLY
5808-54425-0016 AND BEGAN TO SING YOU LL HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER BABY NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME HE LOOKED UP AND HIS EYES WERE FULL OF TEARS TEARS BOTH OF GRIEF AND INTOXICATION THERE WAS AN EXPRESSION OF A WHIPPED DOG ON HIS FACE
5808-54425-0017 HE PLEADED STRETCHING OUT HIS HANDS TO HER HER EYES BLAZED BACK AT HIM BUT SHE SANG ON INSOLENTLY TAUNTINGLY THE VERY INANITY OF THE MAN DISGUSTED HER
5808-54425-0018 AND ON A SUDDEN IMPULSE SHE SPRANG UP AND STRUCK HIM FULL IN THE FACE WITH THE FLAT OF HER HAND HE WAS TOO WEAK TO RESIST THE BLOW AND TUMBLING FROM THE CHAIR FELL LIMPLY TO THE FLOOR WHERE HE LAY AT HER FEET
5808-54425-0019 ALTERNATELY WEEPING ALOUD AND QUIVERING WITH DRUNKEN HICCOUGHING SOBS

5808-54425-0022 AND HE HALF WALKED HALF FELL DOWN THE STREET SADNESS AND SKAGGSY WERE TOGETHER AT THE CLUB THAT NIGHT FIVE YEARS HAD NOT CHANGED THE LATTER AS TO WEALTH OR POSITION OR INCLINATION
5808-54425-0023 AND HE WAS STILL A FREQUENT VISITOR AT THE BANNER HE ALWAYS CAME IN ALONE NOW FOR MAUDIE HAD GONE THE WAY OF ALL THE HALF WORLD AND REACHED DEPTHS TO WHICH MISTER SKAGGS'S JOB PREVENTED HIM FROM FOLLOWING HER HOWEVER
5808-54425-0024 HE MOURNED TRULY FOR HIS LOST COMPANION AND TO NIGHT HE WAS IN A PARTICULARLY PENSIVE MOOD SOME ONE WAS PLAYING RAG TIME ON THE PIANO AND THE DANCERS WERE WHEELING IN TIME TO THE MUSIC

5808-54425-0027 AND HE WAS ABOUT ENTERING UPON A DISCUSSION TO PROVE THAT SADNESS HAD NO SOUL WHEN JOE WITH BLOOD SHOT EYES AND DISHEVELLED CLOTHES STAGGERED IN AND REELED TOWARDS THEM DRUNK AGAIN
5808-54425-0028 SAID SADNESS REALLY IT S A WASTE OF TIME FOR JOE TO SOBER UP HULLO THERE AS THE YOUNG MAN BROUGHT UP AGAINST HIM TAKE A SEAT HE PUT HIM IN A CHAIR AT THE TABLE

5808-54425-0041 THIS HE GULPED DOWN AND FOLLOWED WITH ANOTHER AND ANOTHER FOR A WHILE HE STOOD STILL BROODING SILENTLY HIS RED EYES BLINKING AT THE LIGHT THEN HE TURNED ABRUPTLY AND LEFT THE CLUB
5808-54425-0042 IT WAS VERY LATE WHEN HE REACHED HATTIE'S DOOR BUT HE OPENED IT WITH HIS LATCH KEY AS HE HAD BEEN USED TO DO HE STOPPED TO HELP HIMSELF TO A GLASS OF BRANDY AS HE HAD SO OFTEN DONE BEFORE

5808-54425-0051 THE GOWN HAD FALLEN AWAY FROM HER BREAST AND SHOWED THE CONVULSIVE FLUTTERING OF HER HEART

5808-54425-0055 THIS WAS A TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MAN OR A MONSTER
5808-54425-0056 FOR AN INSTANT SHE LOST THEIR STEADY GLARE AND THEN SHE FOUND HER VOICE THE SCREAM WAS CHECKED AS IT BEGAN HIS FINGERS HAD CLOSED OVER HER THROAT JUST WHERE THE GOWN HAD LEFT IT TEMPTINGLY BARE THEY GAVE IT THE CARESS OF DEATH
5808-54425-0057 SHE STRUGGLED THEY HELD HER HER EYES PRAYED TO HIS BUT HIS WERE THE FIRE OF HELL SHE FELL BACK UPON HER PILLOW IN SILENCE HE HAD NOT UTTERED A WORD HE HELD HER
5808-54425-0058 FINALLY HE FLUNG HER FROM HIM LIKE A RAG AND SANK INTO A CHAIR
5867-48852-0000 BELL HAD DECLARED THAT HER SISTER WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO SEE JOHN EAMES IF HE WOULD GO OVER TO ALLINGTON AND HE HAD REPLIED THAT OF COURSE HE WOULD GO THERE SO MUCH HAVING BEEN AS IT WERE SETTLED
5867-48852-0001 HE WAS ABLE TO SPEAK OF HIS VISIT AS A MATTER OF COURSE AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE ON THE MORNING AFTER THE EARL'S DINNER PARTY I MUST GET YOU TO COME ROUND WITH ME DALE AND SEE WHAT I AM DOING TO THE LAND THE EARL SAID
5867-48852-0002 BUT THE SQUIRE PREFERRED WALKING AND IN THIS WAY THEY WERE DISPOSED OF SOON AFTER BREAKFAST JOHN HAD IT IN HIS MIND TO GET BELL TO HIMSELF FOR HALF AN HOUR AND HOLD A CONFERENCE WITH HER BUT IT EITHER HAPPENED THAT LADY JULIA WAS TOO KEEN IN HER DUTIES AS A HOSTESS
5867-48852-0003 OR ELSE AS WAS MORE POSSIBLE BELL AVOIDED THE MEETING NO OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCH AN INTERVIEW OFFERED ITSELF THOUGH HE HUNG ABOUT THE DRAWING ROOM ALL THE MORNING YOU HAD BETTER WAIT FOR LUNCHEON NOW LADY JULIA SAID TO HIM ABOUT TWELVE
5867-48852-0004 BUT THIS HE DECLINED AND TAKING HIMSELF AWAY HID HIMSELF ABOUT THE PLACE FOR THE NEXT HOUR AND A HALF DURING THIS TIME HE CONSIDERED MUCH WHETHER IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM TO RIDE OR WALK IF SHE SHOULD GIVE HIM ANY HOPE
5867-48852-0005 HE COULD RIDE BACK TRIUMPHANT AS A FIELD MARSHAL THEN THE HORSE WOULD BE DELIGHTFUL TO HIM BUT IF SHE SHOULD GIVE HIM NO HOPE IF IT SHOULD BE HIS DESTINY TO BE REJECTED UTTERLY ON THAT MORNING THEN THE HORSE WOULD BE TERRIBLY IN THE WAY OF HIS SORROW
5867-48852-0006 RESTING WHEN HE MIGHT CHOOSE TO REST AND RUNNING WHEN IT MIGHT SUIT HIM TO RUN AND SHE IS NOT LIKE OTHER GIRLS HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF SHE WON'T CARE FOR MY BOOTS BEING DIRTY SO AT LAST HE ELECTED TO WALK
5867-48852-0007 STAND UP TO HER BOLDLY MAN THE EARL HAD SAID TO HIM BY GEORGE WHAT IS THERE TO BE AFRAID OF
5867-48852-0008 THERE'S NOTHING SETS EM AGAINST A MAN LIKE BEING SHEEPISH HOW THE EARL KNEW SO MUCH
5867-48852-0009 I AM NOT PREPARED TO SAY BUT EAMES TOOK HIS ADVICE AS BEING IN ITSELF GOOD AND RESOLVED TO ACT UPON IT NOT THAT ANY RESOLUTION WILL BE OF ANY USE HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE WALKED ALONG
5867-48852-0010 WHEN THE MOMENT COMES I KNOW THAT I SHALL TREMBLE BEFORE HER AND I KNOW THAT SHE'LL SEE IT
5867-48852-0011 HE HAD LAST SEEN HER ON THE LAWN BEHIND THE SMALL HOUSE JUST AT THAT TIME WHEN HER PASSION FOR CROSBIE WAS AT THE STRONGEST EAMES HAD GONE THITHER IMPELLED BY A FOOLISH DESIRE TO DECLARE TO HER HIS HOPELESS LOVE
5867-48852-0012 AND SHE HAD ANSWERED HIM BY TELLING HIM THAT SHE LOVED MISTER CROSBIE BETTER THAN ALL THE WORLD BESIDES OF COURSE SHE HAD DONE SO AT THAT TIME BUT NEVERTHELESS HER MANNER OF TELLING HIM HAD SEEMED TO HIM TO BE CRUEL AND HE ALSO HAD BEEN CRUEL
5867-48852-0013 HE HAD TOLD HER THAT HE HATED CROSBIE CALLING HIM THAT MAN AND ASSURING HER THAT NO EARTHLY CONSIDERATION SHOULD INDUCE HIM TO GO INTO THAT MAN'S HOUSE THEN HE HAD WALKED AWAY MOODILY WISHING HIM ALL MANNER OF EVIL
5867-48852-0014 WAS IT NOT SINGULAR THAT ALL THE EVIL THINGS WHICH HE IN HIS MIND HAD MEDITATED FOR THE MAN HAD FALLEN UPON HIM CROSBIE HAD LOST HIS LOVE HE HAD SO PROVED HIMSELF TO BE A VILLAIN THAT HIS NAME MIGHT NOT BE SO MUCH AS MENTIONED
5867-48852-0015 HE HAD BEEN IGNOMINIOUSLY THRASHED BUT WHAT GOOD WOULD ALL THIS BE IF HIS IMAGE WERE STILL DEAR TO LILY'S HEART I TOLD HER THAT I LOVED HER THEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF THOUGH I HAD NO RIGHT TO DO SO
5867-48852-0016 AT ANY RATE I HAVE A RIGHT TO TELL HER NOW WHEN HE REACHED ALLINGTON HE DID NOT GO IN THROUGH THE VILLAGE AND UP TO THE FRONT OF THE SMALL HOUSE BY THE CROSS STREET BUT TURNED BY THE CHURCH GATE AND PASSED OVER THE SQUIRE'S TERRACE
5867-48852-0017 HERE HE ENCOUNTERED HOPKINS
5867-48852-0018 MISTER JOHN MAY I MAKE SO BOLD AND HOPKINS HELD OUT A VERY DIRTY HAND WHICH EAMES OF COURSE TOOK UNCONSCIOUS OF THE CAUSE OF THIS NEW AFFECTION I'M JUST GOING TO CALL AT THE SMALL HOUSE AND I THOUGHT I'D COME THIS WAY

5867-48852-0024 EAMES PASSED ON OVER THE LITTLE BRIDGE WHICH SEEMED TO BE IN A STATE OF FAST DECAY UNATTENDED TO BY ANY FRIENDLY CARPENTER NOW THAT THE DAYS OF ITS USE WERE SO NEARLY AT AN END AND ON INTO THE GARDEN LINGERING ON THE SPOT WHERE HE HAD LAST SAID FAREWELL TO LILY
5867-48852-0025 BUT THERE WAS NO ONE TO BE SEEN IN THE GARDEN AND NO SOUND TO BE HEARD AS EVERY STEP BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HER WHOM HE WAS SEEKING HE BECAME MORE AND MORE CONSCIOUS OF THE HOPELESSNESS OF HIS ERRAND HIM SHE HAD NEVER LOVED
5867-48852-0026 AND WHY SHOULD HE VENTURE TO HOPE THAT SHE WOULD LOVE HIM NOW
5867-48852-0027 HAD HE NOT BEEN AWARE THAT HIS PROMISE TO OTHERS REQUIRED THAT HE SHOULD PERSEVERE HE HAD SAID THAT HE WOULD DO THIS THING AND HE WOULD BE AS GOOD AS HIS WORD BUT HE HARDLY VENTURED TO HOPE THAT HE MIGHT BE SUCCESSFUL
5867-48852-0028 IN THIS FRAME OF MIND HE SLOWLY MADE HIS WAY UP ACROSS THE LAWN MY DEAR THERE IS JOHN EAMES SAID MISSUS DALE WHO HAD FIRST SEEN HIM FROM THE PARLOUR WINDOW DON'T GO MAMMA
5867-48852-0029 I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS IT WILL BE BETTER THAT I SHOULD NO MAMMA NO WHAT GOOD CAN IT DO IT CAN DO NO GOOD I LIKE HIM AS WELL AS I CAN LIKE ANY ONE I LOVE HIM DEARLY BUT IT CAN DO NO GOOD LET HIM COME IN HERE AND BE VERY KIND TO HIM
5867-48852-0030 AND I SHALL BE VERY GLAD TO SEE HIM THEN MISSUS DALE WENT ROUND TO THE OTHER ROOM AND ADMITTED HER VISITOR THROUGH THE WINDOW OF THE DRAWING ROOM WE ARE IN TERRIBLE CONFUSION JOHN ARE WE NOT AND SO YOU ARE REALLY GOING TO LIVE IN GUESTWICK
5867-48852-0031 WELL IT LOOKS LIKE IT DOES IT NOT BUT TO TELL YOU A SECRET ONLY IT MUST BE A SECRET YOU MUST NOT MENTION IT AT GUESTWICK MANOR EVEN BELL DOES NOT KNOW WE HAVE HALF MADE UP OUR MINDS TO UNPACK ALL OUR THINGS AND STAY WHERE WE ARE
5867-48852-0032 EAMES WAS SO INTENT ON HIS OWN PURPOSE AND SO FULLY OCCUPIED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF THE TASK BEFORE HIM THAT HE COULD HARDLY RECEIVE MISSUS DALE'S TIDINGS WITH ALL THE INTEREST WHICH THEY DESERVED UNPACK THEM ALL AGAIN HE SAID
5867-48852-0033 THAT WILL BE VERY TROUBLESOME IS LILY WITH YOU MISSUS DALE YES SHE IS IN THE PARLOUR COME AND SEE HER SO HE FOLLOWED MISSUS DALE THROUGH THE HALL AND FOUND HIMSELF IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS LOVE
5867-48852-0034 HOW DO YOU DO JOHN HOW DO YOU DO LILY WE ALL KNOW THE WAY IN WHICH SUCH MEETINGS ARE COMMENCED EACH LONGED TO BE TENDER AND AFFECTIONATE TO THE OTHER
5867-48852-0035 BUT NEITHER KNEW HOW TO THROW ANY TENDERNESS INTO THIS FIRST GREETING SO YOU'RE STAYING AT THE MANOR HOUSE SAID LILY YES I'M STAYING THERE YOUR UNCLE AND BELL CAME YESTERDAY AFTERNOON HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT BELL SAID MISSUS DALE
5867-48852-0036 OH YES MARY TOLD ME I'M SO GLAD OF IT I ALWAYS LIKED DOCTOR CROFTS VERY MUCH I HAVE NOT CONGRATULATED HER BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS A SECRET BUT CROFTS WAS THERE LAST NIGHT AND IF IT IS A SECRET HE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT KEEPING IT
5867-48852-0037 I DON'T KNOW THAT I AM FOND OF SUCH SECRETS BUT AS SHE SAID THIS SHE THOUGHT OF CROSBIE'S ENGAGEMENT WHICH HAD BEEN TOLD TO EVERY ONE AND OF ITS CONSEQUENCES IS IT TO BE SOON HE ASKED WELL YES WE THINK SO
5867-48852-0038 OF COURSE NOTHING IS SETTLED IT WAS SUCH FUN SAID LILY JAMES WHO TOOK AT ANY RATE A YEAR OR TWO TO MAKE HIS PROPOSAL WANTED TO BE MARRIED THE NEXT DAY AFTERWARDS NO LILY NOT QUITE THAT WELL MAMMA IT WAS VERY NEARLY THAT
5867-48852-0039 I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY I SHOULD SO MUCH LIKE FOR A BROTHER I'M VERY GLAD YOU LIKE HIM VERY GLAD I HOPE YOU'LL BE FRIENDS ALWAYS THERE WAS SOME LITTLE TENDERNESS IN THIS AS JOHN ACKNOWLEDGED TO HIMSELF I'M SURE WE SHALL IF HE LIKES IT THAT IS IF I EVER HAPPEN TO SEE HIM
5867-48852-0040 I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR HIM I CAN IF HE EVER COMES UP TO LONDON WOULDN'T IT BE A GOOD THING MISSUS DALE IF HE SETTLED HIMSELF IN LONDON NO JOHN IT WOULD BE A VERY BAD THING WHY SHOULD HE WISH TO ROB ME OF MY DAUGHTER MISSUS DALE WAS SPEAKING OF HER ELDEST DAUGHTER
5867-48852-0041 BUT THE VERY ALLUSION TO ANY SUCH ROBBERY COVERED JOHN EAMES'S FACE WITH A BLUSH
5867-48852-0042 AND FOR THE MOMENT SILENCED HIM YOU THINK HE WOULD HAVE A BETTER CAREER IN LONDON SAID LILY SPEAKING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HER SUPERIOR PRESENCE OF MIND SHE HAD CERTAINLY SHOWN DEFECTIVE JUDGMENT IN DESIRING HER MOTHER NOT TO LEAVE THEM ALONE
5867-48852-0043 AND OF THIS MISSUS DALE SOON FELT HERSELF AWARE THE THING HAD TO BE DONE AND NO LITTLE PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE SUCH AS THIS OF MISSUS DALE'S ENFORCED PRESENCE WOULD PREVENT IT OF THIS MISSUS DALE WAS WELL AWARE
5867-48852-0044 AND SHE FELT MOREOVER THAT JOHN WAS ENTITLED TO AN OPPORTUNITY OF PLEADING HIS OWN CAUSE
5867-48852-0045 BUT NOT THE LESS SHOULD HE HAVE IT OF RIGHT SEEING THAT HE DESIRED IT BUT YET MISSUS DALE DID NOT DARE TO GET UP AND LEAVE THE ROOM LILY HAD ASKED HER NOT TO DO SO AND AT THE PRESENT PERIOD OF THEIR LIVES ALL LILY'S REQUESTS WERE SACRED
5867-48852-0046 THEY CONTINUED FOR SOME TIME TO TALK OF CROFTS AND HIS MARRIAGE AND WHEN THAT SUBJECT WAS FINISHED THEY DISCUSSED THEIR OWN PROBABLE OR AS IT SEEMED NOW IMPROBABLE REMOVAL TO GUESTWICK IT'S GOING TOO FAR MAMMA SAID LILY
5867-48852-0047 TO SAY THAT YOU THINK WE SHALL NOT GO IT WAS ONLY LAST NIGHT THAT YOU SUGGESTED IT THE TRUTH IS JOHN THAT HOPKINS CAME IN AND DISCOURSED WITH THE MOST WONDERFUL ELOQUENCE NOBODY DARED TO OPPOSE HOPKINS HE MADE US ALMOST CRY HE WAS SO PATHETIC
5867-48852-0048 HE HAS JUST BEEN TALKING TO ME TOO SAID JOHN AS I CAME THROUGH THE SQUIRE'S GARDEN AND WHAT HAS HE BEEN SAYING TO YOU SAID MISSUS DALE OH I DON'T KNOW NOT MUCH
5867-48852-0049 JOHN HOWEVER REMEMBERED WELL AT THIS MOMENT ALL THAT THE GARDENER HAD SAID TO HIM DID SHE KNOW OF THAT ENCOUNTER BETWEEN HIM AND CROSBIE AND IF SHE DID KNOW OF IT IN WHAT LIGHT DID SHE REGARD IT
5867-48852-0050 HE HAD SWORN TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT LEAVE THE SMALL HOUSE WITHOUT ASKING LILY TO BE HIS WIFE IT SEEMED TO HIM AS THOUGH HE WOULD BE GUILTY OF FALSEHOOD TOWARDS THE EARL IF HE DID SO LORD DE GUEST HAD OPENED HIS HOUSE TO HIM
5867-48852-0051 AND HAD ASKED ALL THE DALES THERE AND HAD OFFERED HIMSELF UP AS A SACRIFICE AT THE CRUEL SHRINE OF A SERIOUS DINNER PARTY TO SAY NOTHING OF THAT EASIER AND LIGHTER SACRIFICE WHICH HE HAD MADE IN A PECUNIARY POINT OF VIEW IN ORDER THAT THIS THING MIGHT BE DONE
5867-48852-0052 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES EAMES WAS TOO HONEST A MAN NOT TO DO IT LET THE DIFFICULTIES IN HIS WAY BE WHAT THEY MIGHT HE HAD SAT THERE FOR AN HOUR AND MISSUS DALE STILL REMAINED WITH HER DAUGHTER
5867-48852-0053 SHOULD HE GET UP BOLDLY AND ASK LILY TO PUT ON HER BONNET AND COME OUT INTO THE GARDEN AS THE THOUGHT STRUCK HIM HE ROSE AND GRASPED AT HIS HAT I AM GOING TO WALK BACK TO GUESTWICK SAID HE IT WAS VERY GOOD OF YOU TO COME SO FAR TO SEE US
5867-48852-0054 I WAS ALWAYS FOND OF WALKING HE SAID
5867-48852-0055 HAVE A GLASS OF WINE BEFORE YOU GO OH DEAR NO I THINK I'LL GO BACK THROUGH THE SQUIRE'S FIELDS AND OUT ON THE ROAD AT THE WHITE GATE THE PATH IS QUITE DRY NOW I DARE SAY IT IS SAID MISSUS DALE LILY
5867-48852-0056 I WONDER WHETHER YOU WOULD COME AS FAR AS THAT WITH ME AS THE REQUEST WAS MADE MISSUS DALE LOOKED AT HER DAUGHTER ALMOST BESEECHINGLY DO PRAY DO SAID HE IT IS A BEAUTIFUL DAY FOR WALKING
5867-48852-0057 THE PATH PROPOSED LAY RIGHT ACROSS THE FIELD INTO WHICH LILY HAD TAKEN CROSBIE WHEN SHE MADE HER OFFER TO LET HIM OFF FROM HIS ENGAGEMENT COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT SHE SHOULD EVER WALK THERE AGAIN WITH ANOTHER LOVER NO JOHN SHE SAID NOT TO DAY
5867-48852-0058 I THINK I AM ALMOST TIRED AND I HAD RATHER NOT GO OUT IT WOULD DO YOU GOOD SAID MISSUS DALE I DON'T WANT TO BE DONE GOOD TO MAMMA BESIDES I SHOULD HAVE TO COME BACK BY MYSELF I'LL COME BACK WITH YOU SAID JOHNNY
5867-48852-0059 OH YES AND THEN I SHOULD HAVE TO GO AGAIN WITH YOU BUT JOHN REALLY I DON'T WISH TO WALK TO DAY WHEREUPON JOHN EAMES AGAIN PUT DOWN HIS HAT LILY SAID HE AND THEN HE STOPPED MISSUS DALE WALKED AWAY TO THE WINDOW
5867-48852-0060 LILY I HAVE COME OVER HERE ON PURPOSE TO SPEAK TO YOU INDEED I HAVE COME DOWN FROM LONDON ONLY THAT I MIGHT SEE YOU HAVE YOU JOHN YES I HAVE YOU KNOW WELL ALL THAT I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU
5867-48852-0061 NO JOHN NO SHE ANSWERED
5867-48852-0062 ALWAYS NO TO THAT HOW CAN IT BE OTHERWISE YOU WOULD NOT HAVE ME MARRY YOU WHILE I LOVE ANOTHER BUT HE IS GONE HE HAS TAKEN ANOTHER WIFE I CANNOT CHANGE MYSELF BECAUSE HE IS CHANGED
5867-48852-0063 IF YOU ARE KIND TO ME YOU WILL LET THAT BE ENOUGH BUT YOU ARE SO UNKIND TO ME NO NO OH I WOULD WISH TO BE SO KIND TO YOU JOHN HERE TAKE MY HAND IT IS THE HAND OF A FRIEND WHO LOVES YOU AND WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU
5867-48852-0064 DEAR JOHN I WILL DO ANYTHING EVERYTHING FOR YOU BUT THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE THING SAID HE STILL HOLDING HER BY THE HAND BUT WITH HIS FACE TURNED FROM HER NAY DO NOT SAY SO
5867-48852-0065 I COULD NOT HAVE THAT ONE THING AND I WAS NEARER TO MY HEART'S LONGINGS THAN YOU HAVE EVER BEEN I CANNOT HAVE THAT ONE THING BUT I KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MYSELF TO BE BROKEN HEARTED
5867-48852-0066 YOU ARE STRONGER THAN I AM HE SAID NOT STRONGER BUT MORE CERTAIN MAKE YOURSELF AS SURE AS I AM AND YOU TOO WILL BE STRONG IS IT NOT SO MAMMA
5867-48852-0067 I WISH IT COULD BE OTHERWISE I WISH IT COULD BE OTHERWISE IF YOU CAN GIVE HIM ANY HOPE MAMMA TELL ME THAT I MAY COME AGAIN IN A YEAR HE PLEADED I CANNOT TELL YOU SO YOU MAY NOT COME AGAIN NOT IN THIS WAY
5867-48852-0068 THAT I LOVED HIM BETTER THAN ALL THE WORLD BESIDES IT IS STILL THE SAME I STILL LOVE HIM BETTER THAN ALL THE WORLD HOW THEN CAN I GIVE YOU ANY HOPE
5867-48852-0069 BUT IT WILL NOT BE SO FOR EVER LILY FOR EVER WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE MINE AS WELL AS HERS WHEN THAT FOR EVER COMES JOHN IF YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS TO LOVE
5867-48852-0070 YOU WILL SAY NOTHING MORE OF IT I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU MORE OPENLY ABOUT THIS THAN I HAVE EVER DONE TO ANYBODY EVEN TO MAMMA BECAUSE I HAVE WISHED TO MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND MY FEELINGS
5867-48852-0071 I SHOULD BE DISGRACED IN MY OWN EYES IF I ADMITTED THE LOVE OF ANOTHER MAN AFTER AFTER IT IS TO ME ALMOST AS THOUGH I HAD MARRIED HIM
5867-48852-0072 I AM NOT BLAMING HIM REMEMBER THESE THINGS ARE DIFFERENT WITH A MAN SHE HAD NOT DROPPED HIS HAND AND AS SHE MADE HER LAST SPEECH WAS SITTING IN HER OLD CHAIR WITH HER EYES FIXED UPON THE GROUND
5867-48852-0073 SHE SPOKE IN A LOW VOICE SLOWLY ALMOST WITH DIFFICULTY BUT STILL THE WORDS CAME VERY CLEARLY WITH A CLEAR DISTINCT VOICE WHICH CAUSED THEM TO BE REMEMBERED WITH ACCURACY
5867-48852-0074 TO HIM IT SEEMED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD CONTINUE HIS SUIT AFTER SUCH A DECLARATION TO MISSUS DALE THEY WERE TERRIBLE WORDS SPEAKING OF A PERPETUAL WIDOWHOOD
5867-48852-0075 AND TELLING OF AN AMOUNT OF SUFFERING GREATER EVEN THAN THAT WHICH SHE HAD ANTICIPATED
5867-48852-0076 OR HAD ATTEMPTED TO MAKE SO CLEAR AN EXPOSITION OF HER OWN FEELINGS I SHOULD BE DISGRACED IN MY OWN EYES IF I ADMITTED THE LOVE OF ANOTHER MAN THEY WERE TERRIBLE WORDS BUT VERY EASY TO BE UNDERSTOOD
5867-48852-0077 MISSUS DALE HAD FELT FROM THE FIRST THAT EAMES WAS COMING TOO SOON THAT THE EARL AND THE SQUIRE TOGETHER WERE MAKING AN EFFORT TO CURE THE WOUND TOO QUICKLY AFTER ITS INFLICTION THAT TIME SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO HER GIRL TO RECOVER
5867-48852-0078 BUT NOW THE ATTEMPT HAD BEEN MADE AND WORDS HAD BEEN FORCED FROM LILY'S LIPS THE SPEAKING OF WHICH WOULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN BY HERSELF I KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE SO SAID JOHN AH YES
5867-48852-0079 YOU KNOW IT BECAUSE YOUR HEART UNDERSTANDS MY HEART AND YOU WILL NOT BE ANGRY WITH ME AND SAY NAUGHTY CRUEL WORDS AS YOU DID ONCE BEFORE WE WILL THINK OF EACH OTHER JOHN AND PRAY FOR EACH OTHER AND WILL ALWAYS LOVE ONE ANOTHER
5867-48852-0080 WHEN WE DO MEET LET US BE GLAD TO SEE EACH OTHER NO OTHER FRIEND SHALL EVER BE DEARER TO ME THAN YOU ARE YOU ARE SO TRUE AND HONEST WHEN YOU MARRY I WILL TELL YOUR WIFE WHAT AN INFINITE BLESSING GOD HAS GIVEN HER
5867-48852-0081 YOU SHALL NEVER DO THAT YES I WILL I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN BUT YET I WILL GOOD BY MISSUS DALE HE SAID GOOD BY JOHN
5867-48852-0082 AND I WILL LOVE YOU NOW THEN SHE PUT UP HER LIPS AND KISSED HIS FACE AND SO WILL I LOVE YOU SAID LILY GIVING HIM HER HAND AGAIN
5867-48852-0083 HE LOOKED LONGINGLY INTO HER FACE AS THOUGH HE HAD THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE THAT SHE ALSO MIGHT KISS HIM THEN HE PRESSED HER HAND TO HIS LIPS AND WITHOUT SPEAKING ANY FURTHER FAREWELL TOOK UP HIS HAT AND LEFT THE ROOM POOR FELLOW
5867-48852-0084 SAID MISSUS DALE THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE LET HIM COME SAID LILY BUT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
5867-48852-0085 AND THEY MEAN TO BE GOOD NATURED AND TO GIVE ME ANOTHER VERY SHORTLY AFTER THAT LILY WENT AWAY BY HERSELF AND SAT ALONE FOR HOURS AND WHEN SHE JOINED HER MOTHER AGAIN AT TEA TIME NOTHING FURTHER WAS SAID OF JOHN EAMES'S VISIT
5867-48852-0086 HE MADE HIS WAY OUT BY THE FRONT DOOR AND THROUGH THE CHURCHYARD AND IN THIS WAY ON TO THE FIELD THROUGH WHICH HE HAD ASKED LILY TO WALK WITH HIM
5867-48852-0087 AS HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE TOMBSTONES HE PAUSED AND READ ONE AS THOUGH IT INTERESTED HIM
5867-48852-0088 AND THEN PULLED OUT HIS OWN WATCH AS THOUGH TO VERIFY THE ONE BY THE OTHER HE MADE UNCONSCIOUSLY A STRUGGLE TO DRIVE AWAY FROM HIS THOUGHTS THE FACTS OF THE LATE SCENE AND FOR SOME FIVE OR TEN MINUTES HE SUCCEEDED
5867-48852-0089 AND LAUGHED INWARDLY AS HE REMEMBERED THE FIGURE OF RAFFERTY BRINGING IN THE KNIGHT'S SHOES HE HAD GONE SOME HALF MILE UPON HIS WAY BEFORE HE VENTURED TO STAND STILL AND TELL HIMSELF THAT HE HAD FAILED IN THE GREAT OBJECT OF HIS LIFE YES
5867-48852-0090 HE HAD FAILED AND HE ACKNOWLEDGED TO HIMSELF WITH BITTER REPROACHES THAT HE HAD FAILED NOW AND FOR EVER HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT HE HAD OBTRUDED UPON HER IN HER SORROW WITH AN UNMANNERLY LOVE
5867-48852-0091 AND REBUKED HIMSELF AS HAVING BEEN NOT ONLY FOOLISH BUT UNGENEROUS HIS FRIEND THE EARL HAD BEEN WONT IN HIS WAGGISH WAY TO CALL HIM THE CONQUERING HERO AND HAD SO TALKED HIM OUT OF HIS COMMON SENSE AS TO HAVE MADE HIM ALMOST THINK THAT HE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN HIS SUIT
5867-48852-0092 HE ALMOST HATED THE EARL FOR HAVING BROUGHT HIM TO THIS CONDITION A CONQUERING HERO INDEED HOW SHOULD HE MANAGE TO SNEAK BACK AMONG THEM ALL AT THE MANOR HOUSE CRESTFALLEN AND ABJECT IN HIS MISERY
5867-48852-0093 EVERYBODY KNEW THE ERRAND ON WHICH HE HAD GONE AND EVERYBODY MUST KNOW OF HIS FAILURE HOW COULD HE HAVE BEEN SUCH A FOOL AS TO UNDERTAKE SUCH A TASK UNDER THE EYES OF SO MANY LOOKERS ON
5867-48852-0094 WAS IT NOT THE CASE THAT HE HAD SO FONDLY EXPECTED SUCCESS AS TO THINK ONLY OF HIS TRIUMPH IN RETURNING AND NOT OF HIS MORE PROBABLE DISGRACE HE HAD ALLOWED OTHERS TO MAKE A FOOL OF HIM
5867-48852-0095 AND HAD SO MADE A FOOL OF HIMSELF THAT NOW ALL HOPE AND HAPPINESS WERE OVER FOR HIM HOW COULD HE ESCAPE AT ONCE OUT OF THE COUNTRY BACK TO LONDON HOW COULD HE GET AWAY WITHOUT SAYING A WORD FURTHER TO ANY ONE
5867-48852-0096 HE CROSSED THE ROAD AT THE END OF THE SQUIRE'S PROPERTY WHERE THE PARISH OF ALLINGTON DIVIDES ITSELF FROM THAT OF ABBOT'S GUEST IN WHICH THE EARL'S HOUSE STANDS AND MADE HIS WAY BACK ALONG THE COPSE WHICH SKIRTED THE FIELD IN WHICH THEY HAD ENCOUNTERED THE BULL
5867-48852-0097 AH YES IT HAD BEEN WELL FOR HIM THAT HE HAD NOT COME OUT ON HORSEBACK THAT RIDE HOME ALONG THE HIGH ROAD AND UP TO THE MANOR HOUSE STABLES WOULD UNDER HIS PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE BEEN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO HIM
5867-48852-0098 AS IT WAS HE DID NOT THINK IT POSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD RETURN TO HIS PLACE IN THE EARL'S HOUSE HOW COULD HE PRETEND TO MAINTAIN HIS ORDINARY DEMEANOUR UNDER THE EYES OF THOSE TWO OLD MEN IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM TO GET HOME TO HIS MOTHER
5867-48852-0099 TO SEND A MESSAGE FROM THENCE TO THE MANOR AND THEN TO ESCAPE BACK TO LONDON SO THINKING BUT WITH NO RESOLUTION MADE HE WENT ON THROUGH THE WOODS
5867-48852-0100 THERE HE STOPPED AND STOOD A WHILE WITH HIS BROAD HAND SPREAD OVER THE LETTERS WHICH HE HAD CUT IN THOSE EARLY DAYS SO AS TO HIDE THEM FROM HIS SIGHT WHAT AN ASS I HAVE BEEN ALWAYS AND EVER HE SAID TO HIMSELF
5867-48852-0101 IT WAS NOT ONLY OF HIS LATE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT HE WAS THINKING BUT OF HIS WHOLE PAST LIFE HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF HIS HOBBLEDEHOYHOOD
5867-48852-0102 OF THAT BACKWARDNESS ON HIS PART IN ASSUMING MANHOOD WHICH HAD RENDERED HIM INCAPABLE OF MAKING HIMSELF ACCEPTABLE TO LILY BEFORE SHE HAD FALLEN INTO THE CLUTCHES OF CROSBIE
5867-48852-0103 IF SUCH SENDING MIGHT POSSIBLY BE DONE BY FAIR BEATING REGARDLESS WHETHER HE HIMSELF MIGHT BE CALLED UPON TO FOLLOW HIM WAS IT NOT HARD THAT FOR THE TWO OF THEM FOR LILY AND FOR HIM ALSO
5867-48852-0104 THERE SHOULD BE SUCH PUNISHMENT BECAUSE OF THE INSINCERITY OF THAT MAN WHEN HE HAD THUS STOOD UPON THE BRIDGE FOR SOME QUARTER OF AN HOUR HE TOOK OUT HIS KNIFE AND WITH DEEP ROUGH GASHES IN THE WOOD CUT OUT LILY'S NAME FROM THE RAIL
5867-48852-0105 HE HAD HARDLY FINISHED AND WAS STILL LOOKING AT THE CHIPS AS THEY WERE BEING CARRIED AWAY BY THE STREAM WHEN A GENTLE STEP CAME CLOSE UP TO HIM AND TURNING ROUND HE SAW THAT LADY JULIA WAS ON THE BRIDGE SHE WAS CLOSE TO HIM
5867-48852-0106 AND HAD ALREADY SEEN HIS HANDIWORK HAS SHE OFFENDED YOU JOHN SHE SAID
5867-48852-0107 DO YOU MEAN TO CUT IT OUT FROM YOUR HEART NEVER I WOULD IF I COULD BUT I NEVER SHALL KEEP TO IT AS TO A GREAT TREASURE IT WILL BE A JOY TO YOU IN AFTER YEARS AND NOT A SORROW
5867-48852-0108 WILL BE A CONSOLATION WHEN YOU ARE AS OLD AS I AM IT IS SOMETHING TO HAVE HAD A HEART
5867-48852-0109 AND JOHN I CAN UNDERSTAND HER FEELING NOW AND INDEED I THOUGHT ALL THROUGH THAT YOU WERE ASKING HER TOO SOON BUT THE TIME MAY YET COME WHEN SHE WILL THINK BETTER OF YOUR WISHES NO NO NEVER I BEGIN TO KNOW HER NOW
5867-48852-0110 IF YOU CAN BE CONSTANT IN YOUR LOVE YOU MAY WIN HER YET REMEMBER HOW YOUNG SHE IS AND HOW YOUNG YOU BOTH ARE COME AGAIN IN TWO YEARS TIME AND THEN WHEN YOU HAVE WON HER YOU SHALL TELL ME THAT I HAVE BEEN A GOOD OLD WOMAN TO YOU BOTH
5867-48852-0111 I SHALL NEVER WIN HER LADY JULIA AS HE SPOKE THESE LAST WORDS THE TEARS WERE RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS
5867-48852-0112 IT WAS WELL FOR HIM THAT SHE HAD COME UPON HIM IN HIS SORROW WHEN HE ONCE KNEW THAT SHE HAD SEEN HIS TEARS
587-41611-0000 ALTHOUGH THE GIRLS BELONGING TO JULIA'S PARTY WERE SILENT CONCERNING WHAT HAPPENED AT THE OMNIBUS HOUSE THE STORY LEAKED OUT CREATING CONSIDERABLE DISCUSSION AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE TWO UPPER CLASSES JULIA CROSBY HAD A SHREWD SUSPICION
587-41611-0001 THAT EDNA WRIGHT HAD BEEN THE ORIGINAL PURVEYOR OF THE NEWS AND IN THIS SHE WAS RIGHT EDNA HAD UNDER PLEDGE OF SECRECY TOLD IT TO A SOPHOMORE WHO IMMEDIATELY TOLD IT TO HER DEAREST FRIEND AND SO THE TALE TRAVELED UNTIL IT REACHED ELEANOR
587-41611-0002 WITH NUMEROUS ADDITIONS FAR FROM PLEASING TO HER SHE WAS THOROUGHLY ANGRY AND AT ONCE LAID THE MATTER AT GRACE'S DOOR WHILE HER ANIMOSITY TOWARD GRACE GREW DAILY BUT GRACE WAS NOT THE ONLY PERSON THAT ELEANOR DISLIKED
587-41611-0003 FROM THE DAY THAT MISS THOMPSON HAD TAKEN HER TO TASK FOR ABSENCE SHE HAD ENTERTAINED A SUPREME CONTEMPT FOR THE PRINCIPAL OF WHICH MISS THOMPSON WAS WHOLLY UNAWARE UNTIL ENCOUNTERING ELEANOR ONE MORNING IN THE CORRIDOR
587-41611-0004 A DIRECT SLAP IN THE FACE COULD SCARCELY HAVE CONVEYED GREATER INSULT THAN DID THAT ONE INSOLENT GLANCE THE PRINCIPAL WAS AT A LOSS AS TO ITS IMPORT SHE WISELY DECIDED TO IGNORE IT BUT STORED IT UP IN HER MEMORY FOR FUTURE REFERENCE
587-41611-0005 THE SORORITY THAT ELEANOR HAD MENTIONED IN HER LETTER TO THE PHI SIGMA TAU WAS NOW IN FULL FLOWER THE SEVEN GIRLS WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE OMNIBUS HOUSE WERE THE CHOSEN MEMBERS THEY WORE PINS IN THE SHAPE OF SKULLS AND CROSS BONES
587-41611-0006 AND WENT ABOUT MAKING MYSTERIOUS SIGNS TO EACH OTHER WHENEVER THEY MET THE VERY NAME OF THE SOCIETY WAS SHROUDED IN MYSTERY THOUGH NORA O'MALLEY WAS HEARD TO DECLARE THAT SHE HAD NO DOUBT IT WAS A BRANCH OF THE BLACK HAND
587-41611-0007 ELEANOR WAS THE ACKNOWLEDGED LEADER BUT EDNA WRIGHT BECAME A CLOSE SECOND AND BETWEEN THEM THEY MANAGED TO DISSEMINATE A SPIRIT OF MISCHIEF THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL THAT THE TEACHERS FOUND HARD TO COMBAT GRACE HARLOWE WATCHED THE TREND THAT AFFAIRS WERE TAKING WITH CONSIDERABLE ANXIETY
587-41611-0008 WHO WOULD FOLLOW HER ABOUT LIKE SHEEP AND IT WAS OVER THESE GIRLS THAT GRACE FELT WORRIED IF ELEANOR WERE TO ORGANIZE AND CARRY OUT ANY MALICIOUS PIECE OF MISCHIEF AND THEY WERE IMPLICATED THEY WOULD ALL HAVE TO SUFFER FOR WHAT SHE WOULD BE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE
587-41611-0009 GRACE'S HEART WAS WITH HER CLASS SHE WISHED IT TO BE A CLASS AMONG CLASSES AND FELT AN ALMOST MOTHERLY ANXIETY FOR ITS SUCCESS WHAT DOES AIL SOME OF OUR CLASS SHE EXCLAIMED TO ANNE AND NORA ONE DAY AS THEY LEFT THE SCHOOL BUILDING
587-41611-0010 THEY SEEM POSSESSED WITH IMPS THE PHI SIGMA TAU GIRLS AND A FEW OF THE GRINDS ARE REALLY THE ONLY ONES WHO BEHAVE LATELY IT'S LARGELY DUE TO ELEANOR I THINK REPLIED ANNE SHE SEEMS TO HAVE BECOME QUITE A POWER AMONG SOME OF THE GIRLS IN THE CLASS
587-41611-0011 HARDLY A RECITATION PASSES IN MY CLASS
587-41611-0012 THE JUNIORS WILL GET THE REPUTATION AMONG THE TEACHERS THIS YEAR THAT THE JUNIOR CLASS HAD LAST AND IT SEEMS SUCH A PITY I OVERHEARD MISS CHESTER TELL MISS KANE THE OTHER DAY
587-41611-0013 THAT HER JUNIOR CLASSES WERE THE MOST TRYING OF THE DAY BECAUSE SHE HAD TO WORK HARDER TO MAINTAIN DISCIPLINE THAN TO TEACH HER SUBJECT THAT'S A NICE REPUTATION TO CARRY AROUND ISN'T IT REMARKED NORA INDIGNANTLY BUT ALL WE CAN DO IS TO TRY HARDER THAN EVER TO MAKE THINGS GO SMOOTHLY
587-41611-0014 I DON'T BELIEVE THEIR SOCIETY WILL LAST LONG AT ANY RATE THOSE GIRLS ARE SURE TO QUARREL AMONG THEMSELVES AND THAT WILL END THE WHOLE THING OR THEY MAY GO TOO FAR AND HAVE MISS THOMPSON TO RECKON WITH AND THAT WOULD PROBABLY COOL THEIR ARDOR O GIRLS EXCLAIMED GRACE
587-41611-0015 THERE IS TALK OF GIVING A SHAKESPEARIAN PLAY WITH MISS TEBBS TO ENGINEER IT AND THE CAST TO BE CHOSEN FROM THE THREE LOWER CLASSES THE SENIORS OF COURSE WILL GIVE THEIR OWN PLAY LATER HOW DID YOU FIND OUT ASKED ANNE MISS THOMPSON HERSELF TOLD ME ABOUT IT REPLIED GRACE
587-41611-0016 I SHALL TRY AWFULLY HARD FOR A PART EVEN IF IT IS ONLY TWO LINES SAID ANNE EARNESTLY I WONDER WHAT PLAY IS TO BE CHOSEN AND IF IT IS TO BE GIVEN FOR THE SCHOOL ONLY
587-41611-0017 THE PLAY HASN'T BEEN DECIDED UPON YET REPLIED GRACE BUT THE OBJECT OF IT IS TO GET SOME MONEY FOR NEW BOOKS FOR THE SCHOOL LIBRARY THE PLAN IS TO CHARGE FIFTY CENTS A PIECE FOR THE TICKETS AND TO GIVE EACH GIRL A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THEM TO SELL
587-41611-0018 HOWEVER I'M NOT GOING TO BOTHER MUCH ABOUT THE PLAY NOW FOR THE SENIOR TEAM HAS JUST SENT ME A CHALLENGE TO PLAY THEM SATURDAY DECEMBER TWELFTH SO I'LL HAVE TO GET THE TEAM TOGETHER AND GO TO WORK WE'RE AWFULLY LATE THIS YEAR ABOUT STARTING DON'T YOU THINK SO ASKED NORA
587-41611-0019 YES ADMITTED GRACE I AM JUST AS ENTHUSIASTIC OVER BASKETBALL AS EVER ONLY I HAVEN'T HAD THE TIME TO DEVOTE TO IT THAT I DID LAST YEAR NEVER MIND YOU'LL MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME AFTER THANKSGIVING SAID ANNE SOOTHINGLY AS FOR ME I'M GOING TO DREAM ABOUT THE PLAY
587-41611-0020 ANNE I BELIEVE YOU HAVE MORE LOVE FOR THE STAGE THAN YOU WILL ADMIT SAID GRACE LAUGHING YOU ARE ALL TAKEN UP WITH THE IDEA OF THIS PLAY IF ONE COULD LIVE IN THE SAME ATMOSPHERE AS THAT OF HOME THEN THERE COULD BE NO PROFESSION MORE DELIGHTFUL THAN THAT OF THE ACTOR REPLIED ANNE THOUGHTFULLY
587-41611-0021 IT IS WONDERFUL TO FEEL THAT ONE IS ABLE TO FORGET ONE'S SELF AND BECOME SOME ONE ELSE BUT IT IS MORE WONDERFUL TO MAKE ONE'S AUDIENCE FEEL IT TOO TO HAVE THEM FORGET THAT ONE IS ANYTHING EXCEPT THE LIVING BREATHING PERSON WHOSE CHARACTER ONE IS TRYING TO PORTRAY
587-41611-0022 I SUPPOSE IT'S THE SENSE OF POWER THAT ONE HAS OVER PEOPLE'S EMOTIONS THAT MAKES ACTING SO FASCINATING IT IS THE OTHER SIDE THAT I HATE SHE ADDED WITH A SLIGHT SHUDDER I SUPPOSE THEATRICAL PEOPLE DO UNDERGO MANY HARDSHIPS SAID GRACE
587-41611-0023 WHO NOW THAT THE SUBJECT HAD BEEN OPENED WANTED TO HEAR MORE OF ANNE'S VIEWS OF THE STAGE UNLESS ANY GIRL HAS REMARKABLE TALENT I SHOULD ADVISE HER TO KEEP OFF THE STAGE SAID ANNE DECIDEDLY OF COURSE WHEN A GIRL COMES OF A THEATRICAL FAMILY FOR GENERATIONS
587-41611-0024 LIKE MAUD ADAMS OR ETHEL BARRYMORE THEN THAT IS DIFFERENT SHE IS PRACTICALLY BORN BRED AND BROUGHT UP IN THE THEATRE SHE IS AS CAREFULLY GUARDED AS THOUGH SHE LIVED IN A LITTLE VILLAGE SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE KNOWS FROM BABYHOOD ALL THE UNPLEASANT FEATURES OF THE PROFESSION
587-41611-0025 AND HOW TO AVOID THEM THERE IS SOME CHANCE OF HER BECOMING GREAT TOO OF COURSE REAL STARS DO APPEAR ONCE IN A WHILE WHO ARE TOO TALENTED TO BE KEPT DOWN HOWEVER THE REALLY GREAT ONES ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
587-41611-0026 WHEN I COMPARE MY LIFE BEFORE I CAME HERE WITH THE GOOD TIMES I HAVE HAD SINCE I MET YOU GIRLS I HATE THE VERY IDEA OF THE STAGE ONLY SHE CONCLUDED WITH A SHAME FACED AIR THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE DESIRE TO ACT IS IRRESISTIBLE
587-41611-0027 SHE CERTAINLY WILL SAID NORA BUT TO GIVE THE PLAY A REST AND COME DOWN TO EVERYDAY AFFAIRS WHERE SHALL WE MEET TO GO TO THE FOOTBALL GAME LET ME SEE SAID GRACE THE GAME IS TO BE CALLED AT THREE O'CLOCK
587-41611-0028 I SUPPOSE WE SHALL ALL BE THROUGH DINNER BY HALF PAST TWO YOU HAD BETTER BRING YOUR GIRLS TO MY HOUSE EACH OF YOU IS TO HAVE TWO AND JESSICA HAS ONE BESIDES MABEL I AM TO HAVE THREE I FOUND ANOTHER YESTERDAY DAVID PROMISED TO GET ME THE TICKETS
587-41611-0029 BY THE WAY GIRLS DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE OF ANY USE TO INVITE ELEANOR ELEANOR EXCLAIMED NORA AFTER WHAT SHE HAS SAID TO YOU YOU MIGHT AS WELL THROW YOUR INVITATION INTO THE FIRE FOR IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT SHE WILL DO SO WHEN SHE RECEIVES IT
587-41619-0000 WHO MADE AN ENTRY ON HER PAD AND BECKONED TO THE GIRL NEXT TO MARIAN TO COME FORWARD STRAIGHT DOWN THE LINE HE WENT SOMETIMES STOPPING A GIRL AT HER THIRD OR FOURTH LINE RARELY ALLOWING THEM TO READ FARTHER THAN THE ELEVENTH OR TWELFTH
587-41619-0001 NORA WAS THE SECOND PHI SIGMA TAU TO UNDERGO THE ORDEAL AS SHE BRISKLY DELIVERED THE OPENING LINES THE ACTOR STOPPED HER TAKING THE BOOK FROM HER HE TURNED TO THE PART WHERE TOUCHSTONE QUAINTLY HUMOROUS HOLDS FORTH UPON THE LIE SEVEN TIMES REMOVED
587-41619-0002 READ THIS HE SAID BRIEFLY HOLDING OUT THE BOOK TO NORA NORA BEGAN AND READ GLIBLY ON UNCONSCIOUSLY EMPHASIZING AS SHE DID SO DOWN ONE PAGE SHE READ AND HALF WAY THROUGH THE NEXT BEFORE MISTER SOUTHARD SEEMED SATISFIED
587-41619-0003 THEN HE AGAIN HELD CONVERSATION WITH MISS TEBBS WHO NODDED AND LOOKED SMILINGLY TOWARD NORA WHO STOOD SCOWLING FAINTLY RATHER ILL PLEASED AT ATTRACTING SO MUCH ATTENTION
587-41619-0004 WHISPERED JESSICA TO GRACE WHO WAS ABOUT TO REPLY WHEN MISTER SOUTHARD MOTIONED TO HER GRACE WHO KNEW THE SCENE BY HEART WENT FEARLESSLY FORWARD AND READ THE LINES WITH SPLENDID EMPHASIS MARIAN AND EVA ALLEN FOLLOWED HER
587-41619-0005 AND ACQUITTED THEMSELVES WITH CREDIT THEN ELEANOR'S TURN CAME HANDING HER COAT WHICH SHE HAD TAKEN OFF AND CARRIED UPON HER ARM TO EDNA WRIGHT SHE WALKED PROUDLY OVER THEN WITHOUT A TRACE OF SELF CONSCIOUSNESS
587-41619-0006 BEGAN THE READING OF THE DESIGNATED LINES HER VOICE SOUNDED UNUSUALLY CLEAR AND SWEET YET LACKED SOMETHING OF THE POWER OF EXPRESSION DISPLAYED BY GRACE IN HER RENDERING OF THE SAME SCENE WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED
587-41619-0007 SHE HANDED THE BOOK BACK WITH AN AIR OF STUDIED INDIFFERENCE SHE WAS FAR FROM FEELING SHE HAD DECIDED IN HER OWN MIND THAT ROSALIND WAS THE PART BEST SUITED TO HER AND FELT THAT THE HONOR NOW LAY BETWEEN HERSELF AND GRACE
587-41619-0008 NO OTHER GIRLS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NORA HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO READ AS MUCH OF ANY SCENE AS THEY TWO HAD BEEN REQUESTED TO READ BUT ELEANOR HAD RECKONED WITHOUT HER HOST FOR THERE WAS ONE GIRL WHO HAD NOT AS YET COME TO THE FRONT
587-41619-0009 THE GIRL WAS ANNE PIERSON WHO IN SOME MYSTERIOUS MANNER HAD BEEN ALL BUT OVERLOOKED UNTIL MISS TEBBS SPIED HER STANDING BETWEEN GRACE AND NORA CAN YOU SPARE US A MOMENT MORE MISTER SOUTHARD SAID MISS TEBBS TO THE ACTOR WHO WAS PREPARING TO LEAVE
587-41619-0010 JUST AS THAT TEACHER HAD OBSERVED HER AS MOST OF THE GIRLS PRESENT HAD HEARD ANNE RECITE
587-41619-0011 THEY EXPECTED HER TO LIVE UP TO HER REPUTATION AND SHE HAD SCARCELY DELIVERED THE OPENING LINE BEFORE THEY REALIZED THAT SHE WOULD NOT DISAPPOINT THEM HER MUSICAL VOICE VIBRATED WITH EXPRESSION
587-41619-0012 AND THE MOCK SERIOUS BANTERING TONES IN WHICH SHE DELIVERED ROSALIND'S WITTY SPEECHES CAUSED MISTER SOUTHARD TO SMILE AND NOD APPROVINGLY AS SHE GAVE FULL VALUE TO THE IMMORTAL LINES HER CHANGE OF VOICE FROM ROSALIND TO ORLANDO WAS WHOLLY DELIGHTFUL
587-41619-0013 AND SO CHARMINGLY DID SHE DEPICT BOTH CHARACTERS THAT WHEN SHE ENDED WITH ORLANDO'S EXIT SHE RECEIVED A LITTLE OVATION FROM THE LISTENING GIRLS IN WHICH MISTER SOUTHARD AND MISS TEBBS JOINED
587-41619-0014 I WANTED HER TO PLAY ROSALIND AND I KNEW SHE COULD DO IT LOOK GIRLS MISTER SOUTHARD IS SHAKING HANDS WITH HER TRUE ENOUGH ANNE WAS SHYLY SHAKING HANDS WITH THE GREAT ACTOR WHO WAS CONGRATULATING HER WARMLY UPON HER RECENT EFFORT
587-41619-0015 I AM SURE ROSALIND WILL BE SAFE WITH YOU
587-41619-0016 IF I AM ANYWHERE NEAR HERE WHEN YOUR PLAY IS ENACTED I SHALL MAKE IT A POINT TO COME AND SEE IT SHAKING HANDS WARMLY WITH MISS TEBBS AND BOWING TO THE ADMIRING GIRLS MISTER SOUTHARD HURRIEDLY DEPARTED LEAVING HIS AUDIENCE DEVOURED WITH CURIOSITY AS TO THE CHOSEN ONES
587-41619-0017 ANNE STOOD PERFECTLY STILL LOOKING RATHER DAZED THE UNEXPECTED HAD HAPPENED SHE WAS TO HAVE NOT ONLY A PART BUT THE BEST PART AT THAT THE GIRLS GATHERED EAGERLY ABOUT HER CONGRATULATING HER ON HER SUCCESS
587-41619-0018 BUT SHE WAS TOO OVERCOME TO THANK THEM AND SMILED AT THEM THROUGH A MIST OF TEARS LOOK AT ELEANOR WHISPERED NORA TO GRACE SHE'S SO ANGRY SHE CAN'T SEE STRAIGHT SHE MUST HAVE WANTED TO PLAY ROSALIND HERSELF
587-41619-0019 I TOLD YOU SHE'D SULK IF SHE COULDN'T BE THE LEADING LADY GRACE GLANCED OVER TOWARD ELEANOR WHO STOOD BITING HER LIP HER HANDS CLENCHED AND HER FACE SET IN ANGRY LINES SHE LOOKS LIKE THE VENDETTA OR THE CAMORRA
587-41619-0020 OR SOME OTHER ITALIAN VENGEANCE AGENCY DOESN'T SHE SAID NORA WITH A GIGGLE GRACE LAUGHED IN SPITE OF HERSELF AT NORA'S REMARK BUT REGRETTED IT THE NEXT MOMENT FOR ELEANOR SAW THE GLANCES DIRECTED TOWARD HER AND HEARD NORA'S GIGGLE
587-41619-0021 THEN STOPPED AND TURNING HER BACK UPON THE PHI SIGMA TAU BEGAN TALKING TO EDNA WRIGHT JUST THEN MISS TEBBS WHO HAD BEEN BUSY WITH HER LIST ANNOUNCED THAT SHE WOULD NOW NAME THE CAST AND ALL CONVERSATION CEASED AS BY MAGIC
587-41619-0022 MIRIAM NESBIT WAS INTRUSTED WITH THE DUKE WHILE MARIAN BARBER WAS TO PLAY FREDERICK HIS BROTHER JESSICA WAS IN RAPTURES OVER PHEBE WHILE NORA HAD CAPTURED TOUCHSTONE EVA ALLEN AUDREY AND TO HER GREAT DELIGHT
587-41619-0023 YOU WILL REPORT FOR REHEARSAL NEXT TUESDAY AFTERNOON AFTER SCHOOL WHEN TYPEWRITTEN COPIES OF YOUR PARTS WILL BE HANDED YOU SAID MISS TEBBS AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE ROOM THE MOMENT MISS TEBBS CEASED TALKING THE GIRLS BEGAN AS THEY GATHERED IN LITTLE GROUPS AROUND THE LUCKY ONES
587-41619-0024 THERE GOES ELEANOR AFTER MISS TEBBS OBSERVED MARIAN BARBER WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE SHE'S UP TO NOW OH NEVER MIND HER SAID NORA IMPATIENTLY YOU'LL SEE ENOUGH OF HER DURING REHEARSAL IT WILL BE SO PLEASANT TO REHEARSE WITH HER
587-41619-0025 CONSIDERING THAT SHE ISN'T ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH ANY OF US HAD THE GIRL CHUMS KNOWN THEN WHAT ELEANOR WAS UP TO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MATTER OF SURPRISE AND INDIGNATION TO ALL OF THEM AFTER IMPERIOUSLY COMMANDING HER SATELLITES TO WAIT FOR HER IN THE CORRIDOR
587-41619-0026 ELEANOR OVERTOOK MISS TEBBS JUST OUTSIDE MISS THOMPSON'S OFFICE I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU MISS TEBBS SAID ELEANOR AS THE TEACHER PAUSED HER HAND ON THE DOORKNOB WELL WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU MISS SAVELL I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT THE PLAY
587-41619-0027 AND YOU CAN WIN PLENTY OF APPLAUSE PLAYING IT YOU MUST UNDERSTAND HOWEVER THAT ONCE HAVING GIVEN OUT A PART I SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO TAKE IT FROM THE GIRL I HAD GIVEN IT TO SIMPLY BECAUSE SOME OTHER GIRL DESIRED IT THAT WOULD BE BOTH UNFAIR AND UNJUST
587-41619-0028 STOOD AWAITING HER REPLY I SHOULD LIKE TO DO THAT ELEANOR SAID SLOWLY A CURIOUS LIGHT IN HER EYES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS TEBBS
587-54108-0000 SAW THE TRIO APPROACHING FOR A MOMENT HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE GENTLEMAN IN HIS SUMMER ATTIRE WHEN HE DID SURPRISE THEN PLEASURE THEN A SPIRIT OF INQUIETUDE TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM HE HAD BEEN UNEXPECTEDLY STARTLED ON RUTH'S BIRTHNIGHT
587-54108-0001 BY A VAGUE SOMETHING IN KEMP'S EYES THE FEELING HOWEVER HAD VANISHED GRADUALLY IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE DOCTOR ALWAYS HAD A PECULIARLY INTENT GAZE AND MOREOVER NO ONE COULD HAVE HELPED APPRECIATING HER LOVELINESS THAT NIGHT
587-54108-0002 THIS OF ITSELF WILL BRING A SOFTNESS INTO A MAN'S MANNER AND WITHOUT DOUBT HIS FEARS HAD BEEN GROUNDLESS FEARS THAT HE HAD NOT DARED TO PUT INTO WORDS FOR OLD MAN AS HE WAS HE REALIZED THAT DOCTOR KEMP'S STRONG PERSONALITY
587-54108-0003 WAS SUCH AS WOULD PROVE DANGEROUSLY SEDUCTIVE TO ANY WOMAN WHOM HE CARED TO HONOR WITH HIS FAVOR BUT WITH A GET THEE BEHIND ME SATAN DESIRE HE HAD PUT THE QUESTION FROM HIM HE COULD HAVE TAKEN HIS OATH ON RUTH'S HEART WHOLENESS
587-54108-0004 YET NOW AS HE RECOGNIZED HER COMPANION HIS MISGIVINGS RETURNED THREEFOLD THE COURTEOUS GENTLEMAN HOWEVER WAS AT HIS EASE AS THEY CAME UP THIS IS A SURPRISE DOCTOR HE EXCLAIMED CORDIALLY OPENING THE GATE AND EXTENDING HIS HAND
587-54108-0005 KEMP GRASPED HIS HAND HEARTILY I AM A SORT OF SURPRISE PARTY HE ANSWERED SWINGING ETHEL TO THE GROUND AND WATCHING HER SCAMPER OFF TO THE HOTEL AND WHAT IS MORE HE CONTINUED TURNING TO HIM I HAVE NOT BROUGHT A HAMPER WHICH MAKES ONE OF ME
587-54108-0006 THIS IS A VERITABLE LAND OF MILK AND HONEY COME UP AND LISTEN TO MY WIFE RHAPSODIZE HOW IS SHE HE ASKED TURNING WITH HIM AND CATCHING A GLIMPSE OF RUTH'S VANISHING FIGURE
587-54108-0007 HE PROTESTED AT SUCH A STUPENDOUS COMPARISON AND INSISTED THAT SHE MAKE CLEAR THAT THE DUMMY WAS NOT INCLUDED THE SHORT AFTERNOON GLIDED INTO EVENING AND DOCTOR KEMP WENT OVER TO THE HOTEL AND DINED AT THE LEVICES TABLE
587-54108-0008 RUTH IN A WHITE WOOL GOWN SAT OPPOSITE HIM IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD DINED WITH THEM AND HE ENJOYED A SINGULAR FEELING OVER THE SITUATION
587-54108-0009 SHE ATE A HEARTY MEAL AND THAT RUTH WHO WAS UNUSUALLY QUIET TASTED SCARCELY ANYTHING HER FATHER ALSO OBSERVED IT AND RESOLVED UPON A COURSE OF STRICT SURVEILLANCE HE WAS GLAD TO HEAR THAT THE DOCTOR HAD TO LEAVE ON THE EARLY MORNING'S TRAIN
587-54108-0010 THOUGH OF COURSE HE DID NOT SAY SO AS THEY STROLLED ABOUT AFTERWARD HE MANAGED TO KEEP HIS DAUGHTER WITH HIM AND ALLOWED KEMP TO APPROPRIATE HIS WIFE THEY FINALLY DRIFTED TO THE COTTAGE STEPS
587-54108-0011 AND WERE ENJOYING THE BEAUTY OF THE NIGHT WHEN WILL TYRRELL PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE THEM GOOD EVENING HE SAID TAKING OFF HIS HAT AS HE STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE STEPS
587-54108-0012 FATHER SAYS HE HAS AT LAST SCARED UP TWO OTHER GENTLEMEN AND WILL YOU PLEASE COME OVER AND PLAY A RUBBER OF WHIST MISTER LEVICE FELT HIMSELF A VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCES HE AND MISTER TYRRELL HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR A COUPLE OF OPPONENTS AND HAD ALMOST GIVEN UP THE SEARCH
587-54108-0013 NOW WHEN HE DECIDEDLY OBJECTED TO MOVING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HEARTLESS NOT TO GO DON'T CONSIDER ME SAID THE DOCTOR OBSERVING HIS HESITANCY IF IT ILL RELIEVE YOU I ASSURE YOU I SHALL NOT MISS YOU IN THE LEAST GO RIGHT AHEAD JULES URGED HIS WIFE
587-54108-0014 RUTH AND I WILL TAKE CARE OF THE DOCTOR IF SHE HAD PROMISED TO TAKE CARE OF RUTH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO HIS MIND BUT SINCE HIS WIFE WAS THERE WHAT HARM COULD ACCRUE THAT HIS PRESENCE WOULD PREVENT SO WITH A SINCERE APOLOGY HE WENT OVER TO THE HOTEL
587-54108-0015 HE HARDLY APPRECIATED WHAT AN ADMIRABLE AIDE HE HAD LEFT BEHIND HIM IN HIS WIFE KEMP SAT UPON THE TOP STEP AND LEANED HIS BACK AGAINST THE RAILING
587-54108-0016 WHO SWAYED TO AND FRO IN HER ROCKER HE WAS INTENTLY CONSCIOUS OF RUTH'S WHITE FIGURE PERCHED ON THE WINDOW SILL
587-54108-0017 BUT SHE WAS RATHER STARTLED WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THAT KEMP WAS ADDRESSING HER I SHOULD LIKE TO SHOW MY PROWESS TO YOU MISS LEVICE IN WHAT SHE ASKED SOMEWHAT DAZED RUTH RUTH LAUGHED HER MOTHER
587-54108-0018 DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU HAVE NOT HEARD A WORD OF ALL MY GLOWING COMPLIMENTS ON YOUR ROWING AND I WAS TELLING YOUR MOTHER THAT IN ALL MODESTY I WAS CONSIDERED A FINE OAR AT MY ALMA MATER
587-54108-0019 THAT AS IT IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT THERE IS NOTHING TO PREVENT YOUR TAKING A LITTLE ROW AND THEN EACH CAN JUDGE OF THE OTHER'S CLAIM TO SUPERIORITY MY CLAIM HAS NEVER BEEN JUSTLY ESTABLISHED SAID RUTH I HAVE NEVER ALLOWED ANY ONE TO USURP MY OARS
587-54108-0020 AS YET CORRECTED KEMP THEN WILL YOU WRAP SOMETHING ABOUT YOU AND COME DOWN TO THE RIVER CERTAINLY SHE WILL ANSWERED HER MOTHER RUN IN AND GET SOME WRAPS RUTH YOU WILL COME TOO MAMMA OF COURSE BUT CONSIDERING DOCTOR KEMP'S LENGTH
587-54108-0021 A THIRD IN YOUR LITTLE BOAT WILL BE THE PROVERBIAL TRUMPERY STILL I SUPPOSE I CAN RELY ON YOU TWO CRACK OARSMEN THOUGH YOU KNOW THE SLIGHTEST TREMBLE IN THE BOAT IN THE FAIREST WEATHER IS LIKELY TO CREATE A SQUALL ON MY PART
587-54108-0022 IF DOCTOR KEMP WISHED TO ROW HE SHOULD ROW AND SINCE THE JEWISH MISSUS GRUNDY WAS NOT ON HAND ANYTHING HARMLESSLY ENJOYABLE WAS PERMISSIBLE RUTH WENT INDOORS THIS WAS CERTAINLY SOMETHING SHE HAD NOT BARGAINED FOR
587-54108-0023 HOW COULD HER MOTHER BE SO BLIND AS NOT TO KNOW OR FEEL HER DESIRE TO EVADE DOCTOR KEMP SHE FELT A POSITIVE CONTEMPT FOR HERSELF THAT HIS PRESENCE SHOULD AFFECT HER AS IT DID SHE DARED NOT LOOK AT HIM LEST HER HEART SHOULD FLUTTER TO HER EYES
587-54108-0024 PROBABLY THE DISPLAY AMUSED HIM WHAT WAS SHE TO HIM ANYWAY BUT A GIRL WITH WHOM HE COULD FLIRT IN HIS IDLE MOMENTS WELL WITH A PASSIONATE FLING OF HER ARMS SHE WOULD EXTINGUISH HER UNCONTROLLABLE LITTLE BEATER FOR THE NONCE
587-54108-0025 SHE WOULD MEET AND ANSWER EVERY ONE OF HIS LONG GLANCES IN KIND SHE WOUND A BLACK LACE SHAWL AROUND HER HEAD AND WITH SOME WRAPS FOR HER MOTHER CAME OUT HADN'T YOU BETTER PUT SOMETHING OVER YOUR SHOULDERS HE ASKED DEFERENTIALLY AS SHE APPEARED
587-54108-0026 AND DISGUST THE NIGHT WITH LACK OF APPRECIATION SHE TURNED TO A CORNER OF THE PORCH AND LIFTED A PAIR OF OARS TO HER SHOULDER WHY HE SAID IN SURPRISE COMING TOWARD HER YOU KEEP YOUR OARS AT HOME ON THE PRINCIPLE OF NEITHER A BORROWER NOR A LENDER BE
587-54108-0027 WE FIND IT SAVES BOTH TIME AND SPLEEN SHE HELD THEM LIGHTLY IN PLACE ON HER SHOULDER ALLOW ME HE SAID PLACING HIS HAND UPON THE OARS A SPIRIT OF CONTRADICTION TOOK POSSESSION OF HER
587-54108-0028 HE GENTLY LIFTED HER RESISTING FINGERS ONE BY ONE AND RAISED THE BROAD BONE OF CONTENTION TO HIS SHOULDER
587-54108-0029 THE CRICKETS CHIRPED IN THE HEDGES NOW AND THEN A FIREFLY FLASHED BEFORE THEM
587-54108-0030 OTHERS ARE ENJOYING THEMSELVES ALSO HE REMARKED AS THEIR FEET TOUCHED THE PEBBLY BEACH A FAINT CRESCENT MOON SHONE OVER THE WATER RUTH WENT STRAIGHT TO THE LITTLE BOAT AGROUND ON THE SHORE IT LOOKS LIKE A COCKLE SHELL HE SAID
587-54108-0031 AS HE PUT ONE FOOT IN AFTER SHOVING IT OFF
587-54108-0032 IN THE BOW I DISLIKE TO SEE DANGERS BEFORE WE COME TO THEM HE HELPED HER CAREFULLY TO HER PLACE SHE THANKED HIM LAUGHINGLY FOR HIS EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG ARM AND HE TURNED TO RUTH I WAS WAITING FOR YOU TO MOVE FROM MY PLACE SHE SAID IN DEFIANT MISCHIEF
587-54108-0033 STANDING MOTIONLESS BESIDE THE BOAT YOUR PLACE AH YES NOW HE SAID HOLDING OUT HIS HAND TO HER WILL YOU STEP IN SHE TOOK HIS HAND AND STEPPED IN THEY WERE BOTH STANDING AND AS THE LITTLE BARK SWAYED HE MADE A MOVEMENT TO CATCH HOLD OF HER
587-54108-0034 YOU HAD BETTER SIT DOWN HE SAID MOTIONING TO THE ROWER'S SEAT AND YOU SHE ASKED I SHALL SIT BESIDE YOU AND USE THE OTHER OAR HE ANSWERED NONCHALANTLY SMILING DOWN AT HER WITH A HALF PLEASED FEELING OF DISCOMFITURE
587-54108-0035 THAT IS NO HINDRANCE TO MY VOLUBILITY I AM GLAD TO SAY A BACK IS NOT VERY INSPIRING OR EXPRESSIVE BUT RUTH CAN TELL ME WHEN YOU LOOK BORED IF I WAX TOO DISCURSIVE IT WAS A TINY BOAT
587-54108-0036 AND SEATED THUS KEMP'S KNEES WERE NOT HALF A FOOT FROM RUTH'S WHITE GOWN WILL YOU DIRECT ME HE SAID AS HE SWEPT AROUND I HAVE NOT ROWED ON THIS RIVER FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS YOU CAN KEEP STRAIGHT AHEAD FOR SOME DISTANCE SHE SAID LEANING BACK IN HER SEAT
587-54108-0037 SHE COULD NOT FAIL TO NOTICE THE EASY MOTION OF HIS FIGURE AS HE ROWED LIGHTLY DOWN THE RIVER HIS FLANNEL SHIRT LOW AT THE THROAT SHOWED HIS STRONG WHITE NECK RISING LIKE A COLUMN FROM HIS BROAD SHOULDERS
587-54108-0038 AND SEEMED STRIVING TO OUTDO THE NIGHT IN BRILLIANCY FOR A WHILE KEMP MAINTAINED A SORT OF ROLAND FOR AN OLIVER CONVERSATION WITH HER BUT WITH HIS EYES CONTINUALLY STRAYING TO THE GIRL BEFORE HIM IT BECAME RATHER DIFFICULT
587-54108-0039 SOME MERRY ROWERS DOWN THE RIVER WERE SINGING COLLEGE SONGS HARMONIOUSLY
587-54108-0040 THE BALMY SUMMER FREIGHTED AIR MADE HER FEEL DROWSY SHE LISTENED ABSENTLY TO RUTH'S OCCASIONAL WARNINGS TO KEMP AND TO THE SWIFT DIP OF THE OARS NOW WE HAVE CLEAR SAILING FOR A STRETCH SAID RUTH AS THEY CAME TO A BROAD CURVE
587-54108-0041 SHE LEANED A LITTLE FARTHER FORWARD LOOKING PAST KEMP MAMMA THEN SHE STRAIGHTENED HERSELF BACK IN HER SEAT
587-54108-0042 HER HEAD WAS LEANING AGAINST THE FLAG STAFF
587-54108-0043 DOCTOR KEMP MOVED QUIETLY BACK TO HIS FORMER POSITION FAR ACROSS THE RIVER A WOMAN'S SILVERY VOICE WAS SINGING THE SWEET OLD LOVE SONG JUANITA OVERHEAD THE GOLDEN CRESCENT MOON HUNG LOW FROM THE FLOOR OF HEAVEN PULSATING WITH STARS
587-54108-0044 SHE SCARCELY SEEMED TO BREATHE SO STILL SHE SAT HER SLENDER HANDS LOOSELY CLASPED IN HER LAP DOCTOR KEMP SAT OPPOSITE HER AND MISSUS LEVICE SLEPT SLOWLY AND MORE SLOWLY SPED THE TINY BOAT
587-54108-0045 LONG GENTLE STROKES TOUCHED THE WATER AND PRESENTLY THE OARS LAY IDLE IN THEIR LOCKS THEY WERE UNCONSCIOUSLY DRIFTING THE WATER DIPPED AND LAPPED ABOUT THE SIDES THE TENDER WOMAN'S VOICE ACROSS THE WATER STOLE TO THEM
587-54108-0046 SINGING OF LOVE THEIR EYES MET
587-54108-0047 EVER IN THE AFTER TIME WHEN RUTH HEARD THAT SONG SHE WAS AGAIN ROCKING IN THE FRAIL ROW BOAT UPON THE LOVELY RIVER AND A MAN'S DEEP GRAVE EYES HELD HERS AS IF THEY WOULD NEVER LET THEM GO
587-54108-0048 TILL UNDER HIS WORSHIPPING EYES HER OWN FILLED WITH SLOW ECSTATIC TEARS DOCTOR CALLED A STARTLED VOICE ROW OUT I AM RIGHT UNDER THE TREES THEY BOTH STARTED
587-54108-0049 THEY HAD DRIFTED INTO A COVE AND SHE WAS COWERING FROM THE OVER HANGING BOUGHS I DO NOT CARE TO BE ABSALOMED WHERE WERE YOUR EYES RUTH SHE COMPLAINED AS KEMP PUSHED OUT WITH A HAPPY APOLOGETIC LAUGH
587-54108-0050 NO SHE ANSWERED A LITTLE BREATHLESSLY I BELIEVE I AM GROWING FAR SIGHTED IT MUST BE TIME TO SIGHT HOME NOW SAID HER MOTHER I AM QUITE CHILLY
587-54108-0051 WHEN HE TURNED FOR RUTH SHE HAD ALREADY SPRUNG ASHORE AND HAD STARTED UP THE SLOPE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE OARS LAY FORGOTTEN IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT
587-54108-0052 AND THE SLIGHT WHITE FIGURE STOOD STILL TILL THEY CAME UP YOU ARE SO SLOW SHE SAID WITH A RECKLESS LITTLE LAUGH I FEEL AS IF I COULD FLY HOME ARE YOU LIGHT HEADED RUTH ASKED HER MOTHER BUT THE GIRL HAD FALLEN BEHIND THEM
587-54108-0053 SHE COULD NOT YET MEET HIS EYES AGAIN COME RUTH EITHER STAY WITH US OR JUST AHEAD OF US
587-54108-0054 THERE IS NOTHING ABROAD HERE BUT THE STARS SHE ANSWERED FLITTING BEFORE THEM AND THEY ARE STANCH SILENT FRIENDS ON SUCH A NIGHT REMARKED KEMP SOFTLY
587-54108-0055 AND STOOD INSIDE OF IT AS THEY DREW NEAR THEN YOU WILL NOT BE HOME TILL MONDAY HE SAID TAKING MISSUS LEVICE'S HAND AND RAISING HIS HAT AND I AM OFF ON THE EARLY MORNING TRAIN GOOD BY AS SHE TURNED IN AT THE GATE HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO RUTH
587-54108-0056 HIS FINGERS CLOSED SOFTLY TIGHTLY OVER HERS SHE HEARD HIM SAY ALMOST INAUDIBLY TILL MONDAY SHE RAISED HER SHY EYES FOR ONE BRIEF SECOND TO HIS GLOWING ONES AND HE PASSED A TALL DARK FIGURE DOWN THE SHADOWY ROAD
587-54108-0057 SLEEP WITH THIS NEW CROWN UPON HER HUMBLE AS THE BEAUTIFUL BEGGAR MAID MUST HAVE FELT WHEN THE KING RAISED HER SHE WONDERED WHY SHE HAD BEEN THUS CHOSEN BY ONE WHOM SHE HAD DEEMED SO IMMEASURABLY ABOVE HER
60-121082-0000 THE EVENING PASSED ON MADAME DE VILLEFORT EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO RETURN TO PARIS WHICH MADAME DANGLARS HAD NOT DARED TO DO NOTWITHSTANDING THE UNEASINESS SHE EXPERIENCED ON HIS WIFE'S REQUEST M DE VILLEFORT
60-121082-0001 WAS THE FIRST TO GIVE THE SIGNAL OF DEPARTURE HE OFFERED A SEAT IN HIS LANDAU TO MADAME DANGLARS THAT SHE MIGHT BE UNDER THE CARE OF HIS WIFE
60-121082-0002 AS FOR M DANGLARS ABSORBED IN AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION WITH M CAVALCANTI HE PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANYTHING THAT WAS PASSING
60-121082-0003 HE HAD NOTICED THE APPROACH OF VILLEFORT TO MADAME DANGLARS AND HE SOON GUESSED ALL THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM THOUGH THE WORDS HAD BEEN UTTERED IN SO LOW A VOICE
60-121082-0004 WITHOUT OPPOSING THEIR ARRANGEMENTS HE ALLOWED MORREL CHATEAU RENAUD AND DEBRAY TO LEAVE ON HORSEBACK AND THE LADIES IN M DE VILLEFORT'S CARRIAGE DANGLARS MORE AND MORE DELIGHTED WITH MAJOR CAVALCANTI
60-121082-0005 HAD OFFERED HIM A SEAT IN HIS CARRIAGE ANDREA CAVALCANTI FOUND HIS TILBURY WAITING AT THE DOOR THE GROOM IN EVERY RESPECT A CARICATURE OF THE ENGLISH FASHION
60-121082-0006 WAS STANDING ON TIPTOE TO HOLD A LARGE IRON GRAY HORSE ANDREA HAD SPOKEN VERY LITTLE DURING DINNER HE WAS AN INTELLIGENT LAD AND HE FEARED TO UTTER SOME ABSURDITY BEFORE SO MANY GRAND PEOPLE
60-121082-0007 AMONGST WHOM WITH DILATING EYES HE SAW THE KING'S ATTORNEY THEN HE HAD BEEN SEIZED UPON BY DANGLARS WHO WITH A RAPID GLANCE AT THE STIFF NECKED OLD MAJOR AND HIS MODEST SON
60-121082-0008 AND TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE HOSPITALITY OF THE COUNT MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WAS IN THE SOCIETY OF SOME NABOB COME TO PARIS TO FINISH THE WORLDLY EDUCATION OF HIS HEIR
60-121082-0009 HE CONTEMPLATED WITH UNSPEAKABLE DELIGHT THE LARGE DIAMOND WHICH SHONE ON THE MAJOR'S LITTLE FINGER FOR THE MAJOR LIKE A PRUDENT MAN IN CASE OF ANY ACCIDENT HAPPENING TO HIS BANK NOTES HAD IMMEDIATELY CONVERTED THEM INTO AN AVAILABLE ASSET
60-121082-0010 THEN AFTER DINNER ON THE PRETEXT OF BUSINESS HE QUESTIONED THE FATHER AND SON UPON THEIR MODE OF LIVING AND THE FATHER AND SON PREVIOUSLY INFORMED THAT IT WAS THROUGH DANGLARS THE ONE WAS TO RECEIVE HIS FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND FRANCS
60-121082-0011 WERE SO FULL OF AFFABILITY THAT THEY WOULD HAVE SHAKEN HANDS EVEN WITH THE BANKER'S SERVANTS SO MUCH DID THEIR GRATITUDE NEED AN OBJECT TO EXPEND ITSELF UPON ONE THING ABOVE ALL THE REST HEIGHTENED THE RESPECT
60-121082-0012 NAY ALMOST THE VENERATION OF DANGLARS FOR CAVALCANTI THE LATTER FAITHFUL TO THE PRINCIPLE OF HORACE NIL ADMIRARI HAD CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SHOWING HIS KNOWLEDGE
60-121082-0013 BY DECLARING IN WHAT LAKE THE BEST LAMPREYS WERE CAUGHT THEN HE HAD EATEN SOME WITHOUT SAYING A WORD MORE
60-121082-0014 DANGLARS THEREFORE CONCLUDED THAT SUCH LUXURIES WERE COMMON AT THE TABLE OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS DESCENDANT OF THE CAVALCANTI WHO MOST LIKELY IN LUCCA FED UPON TROUT BROUGHT FROM SWITZERLAND AND LOBSTERS SENT FROM ENGLAND
60-121082-0015 BY THE SAME MEANS USED BY THE COUNT TO BRING THE LAMPREYS FROM LAKE FUSARO AND THE STERLET FROM THE VOLGA THUS IT WAS WITH MUCH POLITENESS OF MANNER THAT HE HEARD CAVALCANTI PRONOUNCE THESE WORDS
60-121082-0016 TO MORROW SIR I SHALL HAVE THE HONOR OF WAITING UPON YOU ON BUSINESS AND I SIR SAID DANGLARS SHALL BE MOST HAPPY TO RECEIVE YOU
60-121082-0017 IF IT WOULD NOT BE DEPRIVING HIM OF THE COMPANY OF HIS SON TO THIS CAVALCANTI REPLIED BY SAYING THAT FOR SOME TIME PAST HIS SON HAD LIVED INDEPENDENTLY OF HIM THAT HE HAD HIS OWN HORSES AND CARRIAGES
60-121082-0018 AND THAT NOT HAVING COME TOGETHER IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO LEAVE SEPARATELY THE MAJOR SEATED HIMSELF THEREFORE BY THE SIDE OF DANGLARS
60-121082-0019 WHO WAS MORE AND MORE CHARMED WITH THE IDEAS OF ORDER AND ECONOMY WHICH RULED THIS MAN AND YET WHO BEING ABLE TO ALLOW HIS SON SIXTY THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR
60-121082-0020 AS FOR ANDREA HE BEGAN BY WAY OF SHOWING OFF TO SCOLD HIS GROOM WHO INSTEAD OF BRINGING THE TILBURY TO THE STEPS OF THE HOUSE HAD TAKEN IT TO THE OUTER DOOR THUS
60-121082-0021 GIVING HIM THE TROUBLE OF WALKING THIRTY STEPS TO REACH IT THE GROOM HEARD HIM WITH HUMILITY TOOK THE BIT OF THE IMPATIENT ANIMAL WITH HIS LEFT HAND AND WITH THE RIGHT HELD OUT THE REINS TO ANDREA
60-121082-0022 WHO TAKING THEM FROM HIM RESTED HIS POLISHED BOOT LIGHTLY ON THE STEP AT THAT MOMENT A HAND TOUCHED HIS SHOULDER THE YOUNG MAN TURNED ROUND
60-121082-0023 AND HAD RETURNED JUST AS THEY WERE STARTING BUT INSTEAD OF EITHER OF THESE HE SAW NOTHING BUT A STRANGE FACE SUNBURNT AND ENCIRCLED BY A BEARD WITH EYES BRILLIANT AS CARBUNCLES
60-121082-0024 AND A SMILE UPON THE MOUTH WHICH DISPLAYED A PERFECT SET OF WHITE TEETH POINTED AND SHARP AS THE WOLF'S OR JACKAL'S A RED HANDKERCHIEF ENCIRCLED HIS GRAY HEAD
60-121082-0025 TORN AND FILTHY GARMENTS COVERED HIS LARGE BONY LIMBS WHICH SEEMED AS THOUGH LIKE THOSE OF A SKELETON THEY WOULD RATTLE AS HE WALKED AND THE HAND WITH WHICH HE LEANED UPON THE YOUNG MAN'S SHOULDER
60-121082-0026 AND WHICH WAS THE FIRST THING ANDREA SAW SEEMED OF GIGANTIC SIZE DID THE YOUNG MAN RECOGNIZE THAT FACE BY THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN IN HIS TILBURY
60-121082-0027 OR WAS HE MERELY STRUCK WITH THE HORRIBLE APPEARANCE OF HIS INTERROGATOR WE CANNOT SAY BUT ONLY RELATE THE FACT THAT HE SHUDDERED AND STEPPED BACK SUDDENLY
60-121082-0028 HE ASKED PARDON ME MY FRIEND IF I DISTURB YOU SAID THE MAN WITH THE RED HANDKERCHIEF BUT I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO BEG AT NIGHT
60-121082-0029 SAID THE GROOM ENDEAVORING TO RID HIS MASTER OF THE TROUBLESOME INTRUDER I AM NOT BEGGING MY FINE FELLOW SAID THE UNKNOWN TO THE SERVANT WITH SO IRONICAL AN EXPRESSION OF THE EYE AND SO FRIGHTFUL A SMILE THAT HE WITHDREW
60-121082-0030 I ONLY WISH TO SAY TWO OR THREE WORDS TO YOUR MASTER WHO GAVE ME A COMMISSION TO EXECUTE ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AGO COME SAID ANDREA WITH SUFFICIENT NERVE FOR HIS SERVANT NOT TO PERCEIVE HIS AGITATION WHAT DO YOU WANT
60-121082-0031 SPEAK QUICKLY FRIEND THE MAN SAID IN A LOW VOICE I WISH I WISH YOU TO SPARE ME THE WALK BACK TO PARIS I AM VERY TIRED AND AS I HAVE NOT EATEN SO GOOD A DINNER AS YOU
60-121082-0032 I CAN SCARCELY STAND THE YOUNG MAN SHUDDERED AT THIS STRANGE FAMILIARITY TELL ME HE SAID TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT WELL THEN
60-121082-0033 I WANT YOU TO TAKE ME UP IN YOUR FINE CARRIAGE AND CARRY ME BACK ANDREA TURNED PALE BUT SAID NOTHING
60-121082-0034 YES SAID THE MAN THRUSTING HIS HANDS INTO HIS POCKETS AND LOOKING IMPUDENTLY AT THE YOUTH I HAVE TAKEN THE WHIM INTO MY HEAD DO YOU UNDERSTAND MASTER BENEDETTO
60-121082-0035 AT THIS NAME NO DOUBT THE YOUNG MAN REFLECTED A LITTLE FOR HE WENT TOWARDS HIS GROOM SAYING THIS MAN IS RIGHT I DID INDEED CHARGE HIM WITH A COMMISSION THE RESULT OF WHICH HE MUST TELL ME WALK TO THE BARRIER
60-121082-0036 THERE TAKE A CAB THAT YOU MAY NOT BE TOO LATE THE SURPRISED GROOM RETIRED LET ME AT LEAST REACH A SHADY SPOT SAID ANDREA OH AS FOR THAT
60-121082-0037 I'LL TAKE YOU TO A SPLENDID PLACE SAID THE MAN WITH THE HANDKERCHIEF AND TAKING THE HORSE'S BIT HE LED THE TILBURY WHERE IT WAS CERTAINLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY ONE TO WITNESS THE HONOR THAT ANDREA CONFERRED UPON HIM
60-121082-0038 DON'T THINK I WANT THE GLORY OF RIDING IN YOUR FINE CARRIAGE SAID HE OH NO IT'S ONLY BECAUSE I AM TIRED AND ALSO BECAUSE I HAVE A LITTLE BUSINESS TO TALK OVER WITH YOU
60-121082-0039 COME STEP IN SAID THE YOUNG MAN IT WAS A PITY THIS SCENE HAD NOT OCCURRED IN DAYLIGHT FOR IT WAS CURIOUS TO SEE THIS RASCAL THROWING HIMSELF HEAVILY DOWN ON THE CUSHION BESIDE THE YOUNG AND ELEGANT DRIVER OF THE TILBURY

6000-86686-0016 AND THROWING HER UP IN THE AIR WHEW SAYS HE JIST GIVIN HER A BLAST TO HELP HER AND WITH THAT MY JEWEL SHE TOOK TO HER HEELS FLYIN LIKE ONE O THE EAGLES THEMSELVES AND CUTTING AS MANY CAPERS AS A SWALLOW BEFORE A SHOWER OF RAIN
6000-86686-0017 LOOKING AT HIS POOR OLD GOOSE FLYING AS LIGHT AS A LARK AND BETTER THAN EVER SHE WAS
6000-86686-0018 SAYS SAINT KAVIN FOR MAKING HER THE LIKE BY JABERS SAYS THE KING I SAY NOTHING BEATS THE ART O MAN BARRING THE BEES AND DO YOU SAY NO MORE NOR THAT SAYS SAINT KAVIN AND THAT I'M BEHOLDEN TO YOU SAYS THE KING
6000-86686-0019 I WILL SAYS KING O'TOOLE AND YOU'RE WELCOME TO IT SAYS HE THOUGH IT'S THE LAST ACRE I HAVE TO GIVE BUT YOU'LL KEEP YOUR WORD TRUE SAYS THE SAINT AS TRUE AS THE SUN SAYS THE KING IT'S WELL FOR YOU KING O'TOOLE THAT YOU SAID THAT WORD SAYS HE
6000-86686-0020 WHEN THE KING WAS AS GOOD AS HIS WORD SAINT KAVIN WAS PLEASED WITH HIM AND THEN IT WAS THAT HE MADE HIMSELF KNOWN TO THE KING AND SAYS HE KING O'TOOLE YOU'RE A DECENT MAN FOR I ONLY CAME HERE TO TRY YOU YOU DON'T KNOW ME SAYS HE BECAUSE I'M DISGUISED MUSHA
6000-86686-0021 THEN SAYS THE KING WHO ARE YOU I'M SAINT KAVIN SAID THE SAINT BLESSING HIMSELF OH QUEEN OF HEAVEN SAYS THE KING MAKING THE SIGN OF THE CROSS BETWEEN HIS EYES AND FALLING DOWN ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE SAINT IS IT THE GREAT SAINT KAVIN SAYS HE
6000-86686-0022 THAT I'VE BEEN DISCOURSING ALL THIS TIME WITHOUT KNOWING IT SAYS HE
6000-86686-0023 AND SO YOU'RE A SAINT SAYS THE KING I AM SAYS SAINT KAVIN BY JABERS I THOUGHT I WAS ONLY TALKING TO A DACENT BOY SAYS THE KING WELL YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE NOW SAYS THE SAINT I'M SAINT KAVIN SAYS HE THE GREATEST OF ALL THE SAINTS
6000-86686-0024 AND SO THE KING HAD HIS GOOSE AS GOOD AS NEW TO DIVERT HIM AS LONG AS HE LIVED AND THE SAINT SUPPORTED HIM AFTER HE CAME INTO HIS PROPERTY AS I TOLD YOU UNTIL THE DAY OF HIS DEATH AND THAT WAS SOON AFTER FOR THE POOR GOOSE THOUGHT HE WAS CATCHING A TROUT ONE FRIDAY
6000-86686-0025 BUT MY JEWEL IT WAS A MISTAKE HE MADE AND INSTEAD OF A TROUT IT WAS A THIEVING HORSE EEL AND INSTEAD OF THE GOOSE KILLING A TROUT FOR THE KING'S SUPPER BY DAD THE EEL KILLED THE KING'S GOOSE AND SMALL BLAME TO HIM
6019-3185-0000 THAT SERIES OF TERRIFIC EVENTS BY WHICH OUR QUIET CITY AND UNIVERSITY IN THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF GERMANY WERE CONVULSED DURING THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN HAS IN ITSELF AND CONSIDERED MERELY AS A BLIND MOVEMENT OF HUMAN TIGER PASSION
6019-3185-0001 RANGING UNCHAINED AMONG MEN SOMETHING TOO MEMORABLE TO BE FORGOTTEN OR LEFT WITHOUT ITS OWN SEPARATE RECORD BUT THE MORAL LESSON IMPRESSED BY THESE EVENTS IS YET MORE MEMORABLE
6019-3185-0002 AND DESERVES THE DEEP ATTENTION OF COMING GENERATIONS IN THEIR STRUGGLE AFTER HUMAN IMPROVEMENT NOT MERELY IN ITS OWN LIMITED FIELD OF INTEREST DIRECTLY AWAKENED BUT IN ALL ANALOGOUS FIELDS OF INTEREST
6019-3185-0003 AS IN FACT ALREADY AND MORE THAN ONCE IN CONNECTION WITH THESE VERY EVENTS THIS LESSON HAS OBTAINED THE EFFECTUAL ATTENTION OF CHRISTIAN KINGS AND PRINCES ASSEMBLED IN CONGRESS
6019-3185-0004 I KNEW FAMILIARLY ALL THE PARTIES WHO WERE CONCERNED IN IT EITHER AS SUFFERERS OR AS AGENTS I WAS PRESENT FROM FIRST TO LAST AND WATCHED THE WHOLE COURSE OF THE MYSTERIOUS STORM WHICH FELL UPON OUR DEVOTED CITY
6019-3185-0005 IN A STRENGTH LIKE THAT OF A WEST INDIAN HURRICANE AND WHICH DID SERIOUSLY THREATEN AT ONE TIME TO DEPOPULATE OUR UNIVERSITY THROUGH THE DARK SUSPICIONS WHICH SETTLED UPON ITS MEMBERS AND THE NATURAL REACTION OF GENEROUS INDIGNATION IN REPELLING THEM
6019-3185-0006 BY SACRIFICING WHENEVER CIRCUMSTANCES ALLOWED THEM THEIR HOUSES AND BEAUTIFUL GARDENS IN EXCHANGE FOR DAYS UNCURSED BY PANIC AND NIGHTS UNPOLLUTED BY BLOOD NOTHING I CAN TAKE UPON MYSELF TO ASSERT
6019-3185-0007 IN EVERY ONE OF WHICH THESE PRECAUTIONARY AIDS HAD FAILED TO YIELD THE SLIGHTEST ASSISTANCE THE HORROR THE PERFECT FRENZY OF FEAR WHICH SEIZED UPON THE TOWN AFTER THAT EXPERIENCE BAFFLES ALL ATTEMPT AT DESCRIPTION
6019-3185-0008 THE ASTOUNDED POLICE AFTER AN EXAMINATION THE MOST SEARCHING PURSUED FROM DAY TO DAY
6019-3185-0009 HAD FINALLY PRONOUNCED THAT NO ATTEMPT APPARENTLY HAD BEEN MADE TO BENEFIT BY ANY OF THE SIGNALS PRECONCERTED THAT NO FOOTSTEP APPARENTLY HAD MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION THEN AND AFTER THAT RESULT
6019-3185-0010 AND THE GENERAL FEELING AS IT WAS DESCRIBED TO ME BY A GRAVE CITIZEN WHOM I MET IN A MORNING WALK FOR THE OVERMASTERING SENSE OF A PUBLIC CALAMITY BROKE DOWN EVERY BARRIER OF RESERVE AND ALL MEN TALKED FREELY TO ALL MEN IN THE STREETS
6019-3185-0011 AS THEY WOULD HAVE DONE DURING THE ROCKINGS OF AN EARTHQUAKE WAS EVEN AMONG THE BOLDEST LIKE THAT WHICH SOMETIMES TAKES POSSESSION OF THE MIND IN DREAMS WHEN ONE FEELS ONESELF SLEEPING ALONE UTTERLY DIVIDED FROM ALL CALL OR HEARING OF FRIENDS
6019-3185-0012 DOORS OPEN THAT SHOULD BE SHUT OR UNLOCKED THAT SHOULD BE TRIPLY SECURED THE VERY WALLS GONE BARRIERS SWALLOWED UP BY UNKNOWN ABYSSES NOTHING AROUND ONE BUT FRAIL CURTAINS AND A WORLD OF ILLIMITABLE NIGHT
6019-3185-0013 WHISPERINGS AT A DISTANCE CORRESPONDENCE GOING ON BETWEEN DARKNESS AND DARKNESS LIKE ONE DEEP CALLING TO ANOTHER AND THE DREAMER'S OWN HEART THE CENTER FROM WHICH THE WHOLE NETWORK OF THIS UNIMAGINABLE CHAOS RADIATES
6019-3185-0014 AND IN WHICH THE HEART BEATS IN CONSCIOUS SYMPATHY WITH AN ENTIRE CITY THROUGH ALL ITS REGIONS OF HIGH AND LOW YOUNG AND OLD STRONG AND WEAK SUCH AGENCIES AVAIL TO RAISE AND TRANSFIGURE THE NATURES OF MEN
6019-3185-0015 IN THAT RESPECT THEREFORE I HAD AN ADVANTAGE BEING UPON THE SPOT THROUGH THE WHOLE COURSE OF THE AFFAIR FOR GIVING A FAITHFUL NARRATIVE AS I HAD STILL MORE EMINENTLY FROM THE SORT OF CENTRAL STATION WHICH I OCCUPIED
6019-3185-0016 WITH RESPECT TO ALL THE MOVEMENTS OF THE CASE I MAY ADD THAT I HAD ANOTHER ADVANTAGE NOT POSSESSED OR NOT IN THE SAME DEGREE BY ANY OTHER INHABITANT OF THE TOWN I WAS PERSONALLY ACQUAINTED WITH EVERY FAMILY OF THE SLIGHTEST ACCOUNT BELONGING TO THE RESIDENT POPULATION
6019-3185-0017 A NOBLEMAN CONNECTED WITH THE DIPLOMACY OF RUSSIA FROM WHICH I QUOTE AN EXTRACT I WISH IN SHORT TO RECOMMEND TO YOUR ATTENTIONS AND IN TERMS STRONGER THAN I KNOW HOW TO DEVISE
6019-3185-0018 A YOUNG MAN ON WHOSE BEHALF THE CZAR HIMSELF IS PRIVATELY KNOWN TO HAVE EXPRESSED THE VERY STRONGEST INTEREST HE WAS AT THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO AS AN AIDE DE CAMP TO A DUTCH GENERAL OFFICER AND IS DECORATED WITH DISTINCTIONS WON UPON THAT AWFUL DAY
6019-3185-0019 HOWEVER THOUGH SERVING IN THAT INSTANCE UNDER ENGLISH ORDERS AND ALTHOUGH AN ENGLISHMAN OF RANK HE DOES NOT BELONG TO THE ENGLISH MILITARY SERVICE HE HAS SERVED YOUNG AS HE IS
6019-3185-0020 WHICH MAY ACCOUNT FOR HIS SOMEWHAT MOORISH COMPLEXION THOUGH AFTER ALL THAT IS NOT OF A DEEPER TINGE THAN I HAVE SEEN AMONG MANY AN ENGLISHMAN HE IS HIMSELF ONE OF THE NOBLEST LOOKING OF GOD'S CREATURES
6019-3185-0021 MISTER WYNDHAM'S SUCCESSION TO THE VAST FAMILY ESTATES IS INEVITABLE AND PROBABLY NEAR AT HAND MEANTIME HE IS ANXIOUS FOR SOME ASSISTANCE IN HIS STUDIES INTELLECTUALLY
6019-3185-0022 AS I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT BE SLOW TO DISCOVER BUT HIS LONG MILITARY SERVICE AND THE UNPARALLELED TUMULT OF OUR EUROPEAN HISTORY SINCE EIGHTEEN O FIVE HAVE INTERFERED AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE WITH THE CULTIVATION OF HIS MIND
6019-3185-0023 FOR HE ENTERED THE CAVALRY SERVICE OF A GERMAN POWER WHEN A MERE BOY AND SHIFTED ABOUT FROM SERVICE TO SERVICE AS THE HURRICANE OF WAR BLEW FROM THIS POINT OR FROM THAT
6019-3185-0024 AND TEN YEARS HENCE YOU WILL LOOK BACK WITH PRIDE UPON HAVING CONTRIBUTED YOUR PART TO THE FORMATION OF ONE WHOM ALL HERE AT SAINT PETERSBURG NOT SOLDIERS ONLY BUT WE DIPLOMATES LOOK UPON AS CERTAIN TO PROVE A GREAT MAN
6019-3185-0025 HE WAS TO KEEP A TABLE AND AN ESTABLISHMENT OF SERVANTS AT HIS OWN COST WAS TO HAVE AN APARTMENT OF SOME DOZEN OR SO OF ROOMS THE UNRESTRICTED USE OF THE LIBRARY WITH SOME OTHER PUBLIC PRIVILEGES WILLINGLY CONCEDED BY THE MAGISTRACY OF THE TOWN
6019-3185-0026 THAT ALL WAS CLOSED BEFORE THE END OF SEPTEMBER AND WHEN ONCE THAT CONSUMMATION WAS ATTAINED I THAT PREVIOUSLY HAD BREATHED NO SYLLABLE OF WHAT WAS STIRRING NOW GAVE LOOSE TO THE INTERESTING TIDINGS AND SUFFERED THEM TO SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE COMPASS OF THE TOWN
6019-3185-0027 IT WILL BE EASILY IMAGINED THAT SUCH A STORY ALREADY ROMANTIC ENOUGH IN ITS FIRST OUTLINE WOULD LOSE NOTHING IN THE TELLING AN ENGLISHMAN TO BEGIN WITH WHICH NAME OF ITSELF AND AT ALL TIMES IS A PASSPORT INTO GERMAN FAVOR
6019-3185-0028 NEXT AN ENGLISHMAN OF RANK
6019-3185-0029 THEN A SOLDIER COVERED WITH BRILLIANT DISTINCTIONS AND IN THE MOST BRILLIANT ARM OF THE SERVICE YOUNG MOREOVER AND YET A VETERAN BY HIS EXPERIENCE FRESH FROM THE MOST AWFUL BATTLE OF THIS PLANET SINCE THE DAY OF PHARSALIA
6019-3185-0030 RADIANT WITH THE FAVOR OF COURTS AND OF IMPERIAL LADIES
6019-3185-0031 AN ANTINOUS OF FAULTLESS BEAUTY A GRECIAN STATUE AS IT WERE INTO WHICH THE BREATH OF LIFE HAD BEEN BREATHED BY SOME MODERN PYGMALION SUCH A POMP OF GIFTS AND ENDOWMENTS SETTLING UPON ONE MAN'S HEAD
6019-3185-0032 ON HIS ARRIVAL AT MY HOUSE I BECAME SENSIBLE OF A TRUTH WHICH I HAD OBSERVED SOME YEARS BEFORE THE COMMONPLACE MAXIM IS THAT IT IS DANGEROUS TO RAISE EXPECTATIONS TOO HIGH THIS
6019-3185-0033 WHICH IS THUS GENERALLY EXPRESSED AND WITHOUT LIMITATION IS TRUE ONLY CONDITIONALLY IT IS TRUE THEN AND THERE ONLY WHERE THERE IS BUT LITTLE MERIT TO SUSTAIN AND JUSTIFY THE EXPECTATION BUT IN ANY CASE WHERE THE MERIT IS TRANSCENDENT OF ITS KIND
6019-3185-0034 IT IS ALWAYS USEFUL TO RACK THE EXPECTATION UP TO THE HIGHEST POINT IN ANYTHING WHICH PARTAKES OF THE INFINITE THE MOST UNLIMITED EXPECTATIONS WILL FIND AMPLE ROOM FOR GRATIFICATION WHILE IT IS CERTAIN THAT ORDINARY OBSERVERS POSSESSING LITTLE SENSIBILITY
6019-3185-0035 THE WARNING AT ANY RATE PUT ME ON THE LOOKOUT FOR WHATEVER EMINENCE THERE MIGHT BE OF GRANDEUR IN HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND THIS EXISTED IN SUCH EXCESS SO FAR TRANSCENDING ANYTHING I HAD EVER MET WITH IN MY EXPERIENCE
6019-3185-0036 THAT NO EXPECTATION WHICH IT IS IN WORDS TO RAISE COULD HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED THESE THOUGHTS TRAVELED WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHT THROUGH MY BRAIN AS AT ONE GLANCE MY EYE TOOK IN THE SUPREMACY OF BEAUTY AND POWER
6019-3185-0037 WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE ALIGHTED FROM THE CLOUDS BEFORE ME POWER AND THE CONTEMPLATION OF POWER IN ANY ABSOLUTE INCARNATION OF GRANDEUR OR EXCESS
6019-3185-0038 UNIVERSALLY RECEIVED WITH FAVOR AND DISTINCTION IN REALITY HIS WEALTH AND IMPORTANCE HIS MILITARY HONORS AND THE DIGNITY OF HIS CHARACTER AS EXPRESSED IN HIS MANNERS AND DEPORTMENT
6019-3185-0039 WERE TOO EMINENT TO ALLOW OF HIS BEING TREATED WITH LESS THAN THE HIGHEST ATTENTION IN ANY SOCIETY WHATEVER BUT THE EFFECT OF THESE VARIOUS ADVANTAGES ENFORCED AND RECOMMENDED AS THEY WERE BY A PERSONAL BEAUTY SO RARE
6019-3185-0040 WAS SOMEWHAT TOO POTENT FOR THE COMFORT AND SELF POSSESSION OF ORDINARY PEOPLE AND REALLY EXCEEDED IN A PAINFUL DEGREE THE STANDARD OF PRETENSIONS UNDER WHICH SUCH PEOPLE COULD FEEL THEMSELVES AT THEIR EASE HE WAS NOT NATURALLY OF A RESERVED TURN
6019-3185-0041 HAD COMMUNICATED TO HIS MANNERS A MORE THAN MILITARY FRANKNESS BUT THE PROFOUND MELANCHOLY WHICH POSSESSED HIM FROM WHATEVER CAUSE IT AROSE NECESSARILY CHILLED THE NATIVE FREEDOM OF HIS DEMEANOR
6019-3185-0042 UNLESS WHEN IT WAS REVIVED BY STRENGTH OF FRIENDSHIP OR OF LOVE THE EFFECT WAS AWKWARD AND EMBARRASSING TO ALL PARTIES EVERY VOICE PAUSED OR FALTERED WHEN HE ENTERED A ROOM DEAD SILENCE ENSUED
6019-3185-0043 NOT AN EYE BUT WAS DIRECTED UPON HIM OR ELSE SUNK IN TIMIDITY SETTLED UPON THE FLOOR AND YOUNG LADIES SERIOUSLY LOST THE POWER FOR A TIME OF DOING MORE THAN MURMURING A FEW CONFUSED HALF INARTICULATE SYLLABLES
6019-3185-0044 EITHER AS ACTORS OR SPECTATORS CERTAINLY THIS RESULT WAS NOT A PURE EFFECT OF MANLY BEAUTY HOWEVER HEROIC AND IN WHATEVER EXCESS IT AROSE IN PART FROM THE MANY AND EXTRAORDINARY ENDOWMENTS WHICH HAD CENTERED IN HIS PERSON
6019-3185-0045 WERE THERE THEN NO EXCEPTIONS TO THIS CONDITION OF AWESTRUCK ADMIRATION YES
6019-3185-0046 NEVER WAS THERE SO VICTORIOUS A CONQUEST INTERCHANGED BETWEEN TWO YOUTHFUL HEARTS NEVER BEFORE SUCH A RAPTURE OF INSTANTANEOUS SYMPATHY I DID NOT WITNESS THE FIRST MEETING OF THIS MYSTERIOUS MAXIMILIAN AND THIS MAGNIFICENT MARGARET
6019-3185-0047 AND DO NOT KNOW WHETHER MARGARET MANIFESTED THAT TREPIDATION AND EMBARRASSMENT WHICH DISTRESSED SO MANY OF HER YOUTHFUL CO RIVALS BUT IF SHE DID IT MUST HAVE FLED BEFORE THE FIRST GLANCE OF THE YOUNG MAN'S EYE WHICH WOULD INTERPRET PAST ALL MISUNDERSTANDING
6019-3185-0048 ON THE PART OF MARGARET IT SEEMED AS IF A NEW WORLD HAD DAWNED UPON HER THAT SHE HAD NOT SO MUCH AS SUSPECTED AMONG THE CAPACITIES OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE LIKE SOME BIRD SHE SEEMED WITH POWERS UNEXERCISED FOR SOARING AND FLYING
6019-3185-0049 AND FOR A MERE POSSIBILITY WHICH HE HAD LONG TOO DEEPLY CONTEMPLATED FEARING HOWEVER THAT IN HIS OWN CASE IT MIGHT PROVE A CHIMERA OR THAT HE MIGHT NEVER MEET A WOMAN ANSWERING THE DEMANDS OF HIS HEART HE NOW FOUND A CORRESPONDING REALITY THAT LEFT NOTHING TO SEEK
6019-3185-0050 HERE THEN AND THUS FAR NOTHING BUT HAPPINESS HAD RESULTED FROM THE NEW ARRANGEMENT BUT IF THIS HAD BEEN LITTLE ANTICIPATED BY MANY FAR LESS HAD I FOR MY PART ANTICIPATED THE UNHAPPY REVOLUTION WHICH WAS WROUGHT IN THE WHOLE NATURE
6019-3185-0051 WHO HAD DIED IN GIVING BIRTH TO THIS THIRD CHILD THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD LONG SURVIVED HER ANXIOUS THAT HIS SON SHOULD GO THROUGH A REGULAR COURSE OF MATHEMATICAL INSTRUCTION NOW BECOMING ANNUALLY MORE IMPORTANT IN ALL THE ARTILLERY SERVICES THROUGHOUT EUROPE
6019-3185-0052 AND THAT HE SHOULD RECEIVE A TINCTURE OF OTHER LIBERAL STUDIES WHICH HE HAD PAINFULLY MISSED IN HIS OWN MILITARY CAREER THE BARON CHOSE TO KEEP HIS SON FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS AT OUR COLLEGE UNTIL HE WAS NOW ENTERING UPON HIS TWENTY THIRD YEAR
6019-3185-0053 FOR THE FOUR LAST HE HAD LIVED WITH ME AS THE SOLE PUPIL WHOM I HAD OR MEANT TO HAVE HAD NOT THE BRILLIANT PROPOSALS OF THE YOUNG RUSSIAN GUARDSMAN PERSUADED ME TO BREAK MY RESOLUTION FERDINAND VON HARRELSTEIN HAD GOOD TALENTS
6019-3185-0054 NOT DAZZLING BUT RESPECTABLE AND SO AMIABLE WERE HIS TEMPER AND MANNERS THAT I HAD INTRODUCED HIM EVERYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE HE WAS A FAVORITE AND EVERYWHERE INDEED EXCEPT EXACTLY THERE WHERE ONLY IN THIS WORLD HE CARED FOR FAVOR
6019-3185-0055 SHE IT WAS WHOM HE LOVED AND HAD LOVED FOR YEARS WITH THE WHOLE ARDOR OF HIS ARDENT SOUL SHE IT WAS FOR WHOM OR AT WHOSE COMMAND HE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE DIED EARLY HE HAD FELT THAT IN HER HANDS LAY HIS DESTINY
6019-3185-0056 THAT SHE IT WAS WHO MUST BE HIS GOOD OR HIS EVIL GENIUS AT FIRST AND PERHAPS TO THE LAST I PITIED HIM EXCEEDINGLY BUT MY PITY SOON CEASED TO BE MINGLED WITH RESPECT
6019-3185-0057 AND THE SOLE RESOURCE FOR HIM AS I SAID OFTEN WAS TO QUIT THE CITY TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVE PURSUITS OF ENTERPRISE OF AMBITION OR OF SCIENCE BUT HE HEARD ME AS A SOMNAMBULIST MIGHT HAVE HEARD ME DREAMING WITH HIS EYES OPEN
6019-3185-0058 STARTING FEARFUL AGITATED SOMETIMES HE BROKE OUT INTO MANIACAL MOVEMENTS OF WRATH INVOKING SOME ABSENT PERSON PRAYING BESEECHING MENACING SOME AIR WOVE PHANTOM
6019-3185-0059 FOR MORE THAN I SAW ENOUGH TO FEAR SOME FEARFUL CATASTROPHE LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION SAID HIS CONFESSOR TO HIM IN MY HEARING FOR THOUGH PRUSSIANS THE VON HARRELSTEINS WERE ROMAN CATHOLICS LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION
6019-3185-0060 REVEREND FATHER DO NOT YOU WITH THE PURPOSE OF REMOVING ME FROM TEMPTATION BE YOURSELF THE INSTRUMENT FOR TEMPTING ME INTO A REBELLION AGAINST THE CHURCH DO NOT YOU WEAVE SNARES ABOUT MY STEPS SNARES THERE ARE ALREADY AND BUT TOO MANY
6019-3185-0061 THE OLD MAN SIGHED AND DESISTED THEN CAME BUT ENOUGH FROM PITY FROM SYMPATHY FROM COUNSEL AND FROM CONSOLATION AND FROM SCORN
6019-3185-0062 WHOSE CONVENT STOOD NEAR THE CITY GATES THERE GOES ONE READY EQUALLY FOR DOING OR SUFFERING AND OF WHOM WE SHALL SOON HEAR THAT HE IS INVOLVED IN SOME GREAT CATASTROPHE IT MAY BE OF DEEP CALAMITY
6019-3185-0063 FOR THE COSTLINESS OF THE ENTERTAINMENT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO BE AN EXPRESSION OF OFFICIAL PRIDE DONE IN HONOR OF THE CITY NOT AS AN EFFORT OF PERSONAL DISPLAY IT FOLLOWED FROM THE SPIRIT IN WHICH THESE HALF YEARLY DANCES ORIGINATED
6019-3185-0064 THAT BEING GIVEN ON THE PART OF THE CITY EVERY STRANGER OF RANK WAS MARKED OUT AS A PRIVILEGED GUEST AND THE HOSPITALITY OF THE COMMUNITY WOULD HAVE BEEN EQUALLY AFFRONTED BY FAILING TO OFFER OR BY FAILING TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION
6019-3185-0065 UPON THE EVENING AT WHICH I AM NOW ARRIVED THE TWENTY SECOND OF JANUARY EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN THE WHOLE CITY IN ITS WEALTHIER CLASSES WAS ASSEMBLED BENEATH THE ROOF OF A TRADESMAN WHO HAD THE HEART OF A PRINCE
6019-3185-0066 IN EVERY POINT OUR ENTERTAINMENT WAS SUPERB AND I REMARKED THAT THE MUSIC WAS THE FINEST I HAD HEARD FOR YEARS OUR HOST WAS IN JOYOUS SPIRITS PROUD TO SURVEY THE SPLENDID COMPANY HE HAD GATHERED UNDER HIS ROOF
6019-3185-0067 HAPPY TO WITNESS THEIR HAPPINESS ELATED IN THEIR ELATION JOYOUS WAS THE DANCE JOYOUS WERE ALL FACES THAT I SAW UP TO MIDNIGHT VERY SOON AFTER WHICH TIME SUPPER WAS ANNOUNCED
6019-3185-0068 AND THAT ALSO I THINK WAS THE MOST JOYOUS OF ALL THE BANQUETS I EVER WITNESSED THE ACCOMPLISHED GUARDSMAN OUTSHONE HIMSELF IN BRILLIANCY EVEN HIS MELANCHOLY RELAXED IN FACT HOW COULD IT BE OTHERWISE
6019-3185-0069 HANGING UPON HIS WORDS MORE LUSTROUS AND BEWITCHING THAN EVER I HAD BEHELD HER THERE SHE HAD BEEN PLACED BY THE HOST AND EVERYBODY KNEW WHY THAT IS ONE OF THE LUXURIES ATTACHED TO LOVE ALL MEN CEDE THEIR PLACES WITH PLEASURE
6019-3185-0070 WOMEN MAKE WAY EVEN SHE HERSELF KNEW THOUGH NOT OBLIGED TO KNOW WHY SHE WAS SEATED IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AND TOOK HER PLACE IF WITH A ROSY SUFFUSION UPON HER CHEEKS YET WITH FULLNESS OF HAPPINESS AT HER HEART
6019-3185-0071 THE MUSIC AGAIN BEGAN TO POUR ITS VOLUPTUOUS TIDES THROUGH THE BOUNDING PULSES OF THE YOUTHFUL COMPANY AGAIN THE FLYING FEET OF THE DANCERS BEGAN TO RESPOND TO THE MEASURES
6019-3185-0072 AGAIN THE MOUNTING SPIRIT OF DELIGHT BEGAN TO FILL THE SAILS OF THE HURRYING NIGHT WITH STEADY INSPIRATION ALL WENT HAPPILY ALREADY HAD ONE DANCE FINISHED SOME WERE PACING UP AND DOWN LEANING ON THE ARMS OF THEIR PARTNERS
6019-3185-0073 SOME WERE REPOSING FROM THEIR EXERTIONS WHEN O HEAVENS WHAT A SHRIEK WHAT A GATHERING TUMULT EVERY EYE WAS BENT TOWARD THE DOORS EVERY EYE STRAINED FORWARD TO DISCOVER WHAT WAS PASSING
6019-3185-0074 BUT THERE EVERY MOMENT LESS AND LESS COULD BE SEEN FOR THE GATHERING CROWD MORE AND MORE INTERCEPTED THE VIEW SO MUCH THE MORE WAS THE EAR AT LEISURE FOR THE SHRIEKS REDOUBLED UPON SHRIEKS MISS LIEBENHEIM HAD MOVED DOWNWARD TO THE CROWD
6019-3185-0075 AND HAD LIVED WITH HER UNCLE A TRADESMAN NOT TEN DOORS FROM MARGARET'S OWN RESIDENCE PARTLY ON THE TERMS OF A KINSWOMAN PARTLY AS A SERVANT ON TRIAL AT THIS MOMENT SHE WAS EXHAUSTED WITH EXCITEMENT AND THE NATURE OF THE SHOCK SHE HAD SUSTAINED
6019-3185-0076 MERE PANIC SEEMED TO HAVE MASTERED HER AND SHE WAS LEANING UNCONSCIOUS AND WEEPING UPON THE SHOULDER OF SOME GENTLEMAN WHO WAS ENDEAVORING TO SOOTHE HER A SILENCE OF HORROR SEEMED TO POSSESS THE COMPANY
6019-3185-0077 MOST OF WHOM WERE STILL UNACQUAINTED WITH THE CAUSE OF THE ALARMING INTERRUPTION A FEW HOWEVER WHO HAD HEARD HER FIRST AGITATED WORDS
6019-3185-0078 NOW RUSHED TUMULTUOUSLY OUT OF THE BALLROOM TO SATISFY THEMSELVES ON THE SPOT THE DISTANCE WAS NOT GREAT AND WITHIN FIVE MINUTES SEVERAL PERSONS RETURNED HASTILY AND CRIED OUT TO THE CROWD OF LADIES THAT ALL WAS TRUE WHICH THE YOUNG GIRL HAD SAID
6019-3185-0079 WHAT WAS TRUE THAT HER UNCLE MISTER WEISHAUPT'S FAMILY HAD BEEN MURDERED THAT NOT ONE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY HAD BEEN SPARED NAMELY MISTER WEISHAUPT HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE NEITHER OF THEM MUCH ABOVE SIXTY
6019-3185-0080 BUT BOTH INFIRM BEYOND THEIR YEARS TWO MAIDEN SISTERS OF MISTER WEISHAUPT FROM FORTY TO FORTY SIX YEARS OF AGE AND AN ELDERLY FEMALE DOMESTIC
6019-3185-0081 AN INCIDENT HAPPENED DURING THE RECITAL OF THESE HORRORS AND OF THE DETAILS WHICH FOLLOWED THAT FURNISHED MATTER FOR CONVERSATION EVEN IN THESE HOURS WHEN SO THRILLING AN INTEREST HAD POSSESSION OF ALL MINDS MANY LADIES FAINTED AMONG THEM
6019-3185-0082 AND SHE WOULD HAVE FALLEN TO THE GROUND BUT FOR MAXIMILIAN WHO SPRANG FORWARD AND CAUGHT HER IN HIS ARMS SHE WAS LONG OF RETURNING TO HERSELF AND DURING THE AGONY OF HIS SUSPENSE HE STOOPED AND KISSED HER PALLID LIPS
6019-3185-0083 THAT SIGHT WAS MORE THAN COULD BE BORNE BY ONE WHO STOOD A LITTLE BEHIND THE GROUP HE RUSHED FORWARD WITH EYES GLARING LIKE A TIGER'S AND LEVELED A BLOW AT MAXIMILIAN IT WAS POOR MANIACAL VON HARRELSTEIN
6019-3185-0084 MANY PEOPLE STEPPED FORWARD AND CHECKED HIS ARM UPLIFTED FOR A REPETITION OF THIS OUTRAGE ONE OR TWO HAD SOME INFLUENCE WITH HIM AND LED HIM AWAY FROM THE SPOT
6019-3185-0085 WHILE AS TO MAXIMILIAN SO ABSORBED WAS HE THAT HE HAD NOT SO MUCH AS PERCEIVED THE AFFRONT OFFERED TO HIMSELF MARGARET ON REVIVING WAS CONFOUNDED AT FINDING HERSELF SO SITUATED AMID A GREAT CROWD
6019-3185-0086 AND YET THE PRUDES COMPLAINED THAT THERE WAS A LOOK OF LOVE EXCHANGED BETWEEN HERSELF AND MAXIMILIAN THAT OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ESCAPED HER IN SUCH A SITUATION IF THEY MEANT BY SUCH A SITUATION ONE SO PUBLIC
6019-3185-0087 THAT IT WAS A SITUATION OF EXCESSIVE AGITATION BUT IF THEY ALLUDED TO THE HORRORS OF THE MOMENT NO SITUATION MORE NATURALLY OPENS THE HEART TO AFFECTION AND CONFIDING LOVE THAN THE RECOIL FROM SCENES OF EXQUISITE TERROR
6019-3185-0088 WERE MARKED BY THE COOLEST NAY THE MOST SNEERING INDIFFERENCE THE FIRST THING HE DID ON BEING ACQUAINTED WITH THE SUSPICIONS AGAINST HIMSELF WAS TO LAUGH FEROCIOUSLY AND TO ALL APPEARANCE MOST CORDIALLY AND UNAFFECTEDLY
6019-3185-0089 GOLD REPEATERS MASSY PLATE GOLD SNUFF BOXES UNTOUCHED THAT ARGUMENT CERTAINLY WEIGHED MUCH IN HIS FAVOR AND YET AGAIN IT WAS TURNED AGAINST HIM FOR A MAGISTRATE ASKED HIM HOW HE HAPPENED TO KNOW ALREADY THAT NOTHING HAD BEEN TOUCHED
6019-3185-0090 TRUE IT WAS AND A FACT WHICH HAD PUZZLED NO LESS THAN IT HAD AWED THE MAGISTRATES THAT UPON THEIR EXAMINATION OF THE PREMISES MANY RICH ARTICLES OF BIJOUTERIE JEWELRY AND PERSONAL ORNAMENTS HAD BEEN FOUND LYING UNDERANGED
6019-3185-0091 FOR THE PRIVATE CELEBRATION OF MASS THIS CRUCIFIX AS WELL AS EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE LITTLE CLOSET
6019-3185-0092 FOR HITHER HAD ONE OF THE LADIES FLED HITHER HAD ONE OF THE MURDERERS PURSUED SHE HAD CLASPED THE GOLDEN PILLARS WHICH SUPPORTED THE ALTAR HAD TURNED PERHAPS HER DYING LOOKS UPON THE CRUCIFIX
6019-3185-0093 FOR THERE WITH ONE ARM STILL WREATHED ABOUT THE ALTAR FOOT THOUGH IN HER AGONY SHE HAD TURNED ROUND UPON HER FACE DID THE ELDER SISTER LIE WHEN THE MAGISTRATES FIRST BROKE OPEN THE STREET DOOR AND UPON THE BEAUTIFUL PARQUET
6019-3185-0094 OR INLAID FLOOR WHICH RAN ROUND THE ROOM WERE STILL IMPRESSED THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE MURDERER THESE IT WAS HOPED MIGHT FURNISH A CLEW TO THE DISCOVERY OF ONE AT LEAST AMONG THE MURDEROUS BAND THEY WERE RATHER DIFFICULT TO TRACE ACCURATELY
6019-3185-0095 THOSE PARTS OF THE TRACES WHICH LAY UPON THE BLACK TESSELLAE BEING LESS DISTINCT IN THE OUTLINE THAN THE OTHERS UPON THE WHITE OR COLORED MOST UNQUESTIONABLY SO FAR AS THIS WENT IT FURNISHED A NEGATIVE CIRCUMSTANCE IN FAVOR OF THE NEGRO
6019-3185-0096 FOR THE FOOTSTEPS WERE VERY DIFFERENT IN OUTLINE FROM HIS AND SMALLER FOR AARON WAS A MAN OF COLOSSAL BUILD
6019-3185-0097 AND AS TO HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE PREMISES HAD BEEN FOUND AND HIS HAVING SO FAMILIARLY RELIED UPON THE FACT OF NO ROBBERY HAVING TAKEN PLACE AS AN ARGUMENT ON HIS OWN BEHALF
6019-3185-0098 HE CONTENDED THAT HE HAD HIMSELF BEEN AMONG THE CROWD THAT PUSHED INTO THE HOUSE ALONG WITH THE MAGISTRATES THAT FROM HIS PREVIOUS ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE ROOMS AND THEIR ORDINARY CONDITION
6019-3185-0099 THAT IN FACT HE HAD SEEN ENOUGH FOR HIS ARGUMENT BEFORE HE AND THE REST OF THE MOB HAD BEEN EJECTED BY THE MAGISTRATES BUT FINALLY THAT INDEPENDENTLY OF ALL THIS HE HAD HEARD BOTH THE OFFICERS AS THEY CONDUCTED HIM
6019-3185-0100 IN SIX WEEKS OR LESS FROM THE DATE OF THIS TERRIFIC EVENT THE NEGRO WAS SET AT LIBERTY BY A MAJORITY OF VOICES AMONG THE MAGISTRATES IN THAT SHORT INTERVAL OTHER EVENTS HAD OCCURRED NO LESS TERRIFIC AND MYSTERIOUS
6019-3185-0101 ATTACKED THEM SINGLY IN FLIGHT FOR IN THIS FIRST CASE ALL BUT ONE OF THE MURDERED PERSONS APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN MAKING FOR THE STREET DOOR AND IN ALL THIS THERE WAS NO SUBJECT FOR WONDER EXCEPT THE ORIGINAL ONE AS TO THE MOTIVE
6019-3185-0102 IN SAD LEISURELY OR IN TERRIFIC GROUPS SEEMED TO ARGUE A LETHARGY LIKE THAT OF APOPLEXY IN THE VICTIMS ONE AND ALL THE VERY MIDNIGHT OF MYSTERIOUS AWE FELL UPON ALL MINDS
6019-3185-0103 THREE WEEKS HAD PASSED SINCE THE MURDER AT MISTER WEISHAUPT'S THREE WEEKS THE MOST AGITATED THAT HAD BEEN KNOWN IN THIS SEQUESTERED CITY WE FELT OURSELVES SOLITARY AND THROWN UPON OUR OWN RESOURCES
6019-3185-0104 ALL COMBINATION WITH OTHER TOWNS BEING UNAVAILING FROM THEIR GREAT DISTANCE OUR SITUATION WAS NO ORDINARY ONE HAD THERE BEEN SOME MYSTERIOUS ROBBERS AMONG US THE CHANCES OF A VISIT DIVIDED AMONG SO MANY
6019-3185-0105 WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO SMALL TO DISTRESS THE MOST TIMID WHILE TO YOUNG AND HIGH SPIRITED PEOPLE WITH COURAGE TO SPARE FOR ORDINARY TRIALS
6019-3185-0106 BUT MURDERERS EXTERMINATING MURDERERS CLOTHED IN MYSTERY AND UTTER DARKNESS THESE WERE OBJECTS TOO TERRIFIC FOR ANY FAMILY TO CONTEMPLATE WITH FORTITUDE
6019-3185-0107 HAD THESE VERY MURDERERS ADDED TO THEIR FUNCTIONS THOSE OF ROBBERY THEY WOULD HAVE BECOME LESS TERRIFIC
6019-3185-0108 FROM THE ROLL OF THOSE WHO WERE LIABLE TO A VISIT WHILE SUCH AS KNEW THEMSELVES LIABLE WOULD HAVE HAD WARNING OF THEIR DANGER IN THE FACT OF BEING RICH AND WOULD FROM THE VERY RICHES WHICH CONSTITUTED THAT DANGER HAVE DERIVED THE MEANS OF REPELLING IT BUT AS THINGS WERE
6019-3185-0109 NO MAN COULD GUESS WHAT IT WAS THAT MUST MAKE HIM OBNOXIOUS TO THE MURDERERS IMAGINATION EXHAUSTED ITSELF IN VAIN GUESSES AT THE CAUSES WHICH COULD BY POSSIBILITY HAVE MADE THE POOR WEISHAUPTS OBJECTS OF SUCH HATRED TO ANY MAN

6019-3185-0111 AND BEING RICH BEYOND THEIR WANTS OR ANY MEANS OF EMPLOYING WEALTH WHICH THEIR GLOOMY ASCETICISM ALLOWED THEY HAD THE POWER OF DOING A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD AMONG THE INDIGENT PAPISTS OF THE SUBURBS

6064-300880-0027 FROM ITS WINDOW EMERGED A HEAVY PUFF OF SMOKE FROM ITS DOOR EMERGED MISTER THOMAS HARMON WHO ROLLED UPON THE PAVEMENT APPARENTLY STRANGLING MISTER MURPHY RUSHED TO HIS AID
6064-300880-0028 WHEN HE WAS RESTORED TO HIS FEET AND HIS BREATH AND THE TAXI HAD CEASED TO IMITATE FAFNIR THE DRAGON A TALL FIGURE IN AN EXTREMELY ENGLISH ULSTER WHICH HAD HASTILY EMERGED FROM THE REMSEN FRONT DOOR RUSHED DOWN TEN STEPS
6064-300880-0029 AND LEISURELY CLIMBED THEM AGAIN WAS WRENCHING VIOLENTLY AT THE BELL FOR A TIME MISTER MURPHY REGARDED HIM DISDAINFULLY THEN CROSSED OVER HELD BRIEF COLLOQUY AND RETURNED HOT CHANCE HE'S GOT OF BREAKING IN
6064-300880-0030 HE OBSERVED TO MISTER HARMON WHAT IS HE MAKING ALL THE FUSS ABOUT INQUIRED THAT GENTLEMAN AS THE VISITOR AGAIN APPLIED HIMSELF FORCEFULLY TO THE BELL WANTS TO SEE MISTER REMSEN
6064-300880-0031 BUT THE OLD BULLDOG OF A BUTLER WON'T LET HIM PUT HIS NOSE INSIDE THE DOOR SAYS HIS NAME IS CARTERET AND HE'S COME ALL THE WAY FROM ENGLAND TO SEE HIM ENGLAND NOT RODDY CARTERET
6064-300880-0032 IT WAS DONE ALMOST AS WELL AS THAT ACCOMPLISHED ACTOR MISTER JACOB REMSEN COULD HAVE DONE IT HARMON SPRANG ACROSS THE STREET
6064-300880-0033 HE CALLED WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING OVER HERE THE BELL RINGER ADJUSTED A MONOCLE AND AMBLED DOWN THE STEPS TO SHAKE HANDS
6064-300880-0034 PERHAPS YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT'S AMISS WITH THIS BEASTLY HOUSE I'LL TELL YOU PROFFERED THE OBLIGING AND INNOCENT MISTER MURPHY HE DID SO THEN I'LL JUST GO BACK AND JOLLY WELL CAMP THERE TILL SOMEBODY JOLLY WELL LETS ME IN
6064-300880-0035 DECIDED THE CALLER ARGUMENT FOLLOWED WHILE THE CHAUFFEUR BURROWED INTO THE MECHANISM OF HIS CAR IT ENDED BY THE ENGLISHMAN BESTOWING TWO DOLLARS UPON MISTER MURPHY TO GET A MESSAGE TO MISTER REMSEN CONTAINING A PROTEST AND AN ADDRESS
6064-300880-0036 THE TWO GENTLEMEN THEN MOVED AWAY IN THE EXTINGUISHED TAXI TICKETS HAD BEEN PROVIDED BY THE FORETHOUGHTFUL HARMON THE FUGITIVE WAS THE FIRST MAN IN THE PARLOR CAR
6064-300880-0037 AND WERE SHOWN INTO DRAWING ROOM A AT THE UPPER END OF THE CAR SHORTLY AFTER ANOTHER COUPLE ALSO GLISTENING AS TO GARB ENTERED AND TOOK POSSESSION OF DRAWING ROOM B AT THE LOWER END OF THE CAR
6064-300880-0038 THE ELUDER OF JUSTICE EYED THEM AND DREW HIS OWN CONCLUSIONS HERE WE ARE ALL OF US HE SAID TO HIMSELF RETIRING DISCREETLY BEHIND HIS NEWSPAPER
6064-56165-0000 HE WAS A HARVARD SOPHOMORE AND REALIZED HIS OWN IMPORTANCE QUITE AS MUCH AS THE GIRLS DID BUT STILL THERE WAS ALWAYS THE CHANCE THAT HE WOULD COME INTO THE ROOM JUST FOR A MINUTE AND TELL THEM SOME OF THE LATEST CAMBRIDGE NEWS
6064-56165-0001 HE WOULD HAVE SCORNED TO CALL IT GOSSIP IF THERE WAS ANY ONE THING IN THE WORLD HE HATED SO HE SAID IT WAS GIRLS TALK THIS JABBERING ABOUT NOTHING FOR HIS PART HE WOULDN'T WASTE HIS TIME THAT WAY
6064-56165-0002 YET WHEN HE HAD AN APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE AND GIRLS GENERALLY APPRECIATED WHAT PHILIP SAID HE WOULD OFTEN SPEND AS MUCH AS HALF AN HOUR TALKING ABOUT THE FELLOWS
6064-56165-0003 AND HE WOULD GROW ALMOST ENTHUSIASTIC WHEN DESCRIBING THE TUSSLE BETWEEN NED BROWN AND STANLEY HOOPER OVER THE RESPECTIVE MERITS OF BOSTON AND NEW YORK IN WHICH HOOPER THE NEW YORKER WAS TERRIBLY BEATEN AND UPON MY WORD HE CONCLUDED
6064-56165-0004 I WASN'T SORRY FOR THE NEW YORK SET IS GETTING JUST UNBEARABLE I WOULDN'T SO MUCH MIND FIGHTING STANLEY HOOPER MYSELF ABOUT NEW YORK AND BOSTON I GUESS I'D SHOW HIM THAT NEW YORK ISN'T THE WHOLE WORLD
6064-56165-0005 I SHOULD SAY NOT EXCLAIMED NORA BUT BELLE WHO HAD SOME NEW YORK COUSINS WAS SILENT BRENDA HOWEVER NOTICING BELLE'S EXPRESSION AND NOT FEELING DISPOSED TO SIDE COMPLETELY WITH NORA SAID
6064-56165-0006 YOU'RE TERRIBLY NARROW NORA TO THINK THAT NOBODY'S ANY GOOD UNLESS HE COMES FROM BOSTON I DIDN'T SAY SO REPLIED NORA NO BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN AND I'M SURPRISED PHILIP BLAIR
6064-56165-0007 WELL YOU'D BETTER TALK BRENDA BARLOW BROKE IN NORA AGAIN JUST SEE THE WAY YOU TREAT JULIA IF SHE'D BEEN BORN IN BOSTON I DON'T TREAT HER INTERRUPTED BRENDA
6064-56165-0008 NO THAT'S JUST IT YOU DON'T TREAT HER DECENTLY
6064-56165-0009 HOW QUEER GIRLS ARE DO YOU ALWAYS FIGHT LIKE THIS WHEN YOU'RE TOGETHER WE DON'T FIGHT LIKE YOU BOYS ANSWERED EDITH GOOD HUMOREDLY WE DON'T KNOCK EACH OTHER DOWN AND RUN THE RISK OF BREAKING ONE ANOTHER'S NOSES
6064-56165-0010 PHILIP LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER IN THE GLASS THERE WAS NOTHING THE MATTER WITH HIS OWN SHAPELY NOSE AND I DOUBT THAT HE WOULD HAVE RUN ANY SUCH RISK AS EDITH SUGGESTED PERHAPS THIS WAS THE REASON WHY PHILIP WAS NOT A FIGHTER
6064-56165-0011 THERE WAS ONE GOOD THING ABOUT THE LITTLE DISPUTES IN WHICH BRENDA AND BELLE INDULGED THEY VERY SELDOM LASTED LONG IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE THE GIRLS WERE ASHAMED OF HAVING SHOWN TEMPER BEFORE PHILIP
6064-56165-0012 OH SAY DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE TIME WILL HARDON HAD WITH THE DICKY LAST WEEK HE ASKED NORA NODDED SHE TOO HAD A BROTHER IN COLLEGE WHAT WAS IT ASKED EDITH YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME PHILIP
6064-56165-0013 HOW FUNNY YOU ARE EDITH SAID BELLE YOU NEVER HEAR ANYTHING HASN'T ANYONE TOLD YOU HOW THE OTHER FELLOWS MADE HIM RUN BLINDFOLDED IN HIS SHIRT SLEEVES DOWN BEACON STREET NO REALLY
6064-56165-0014 AND EVERYBODY LOOKING AT HIM OH SAID ONE GIRL AND AH SAID ANOTHER AND HOW SILLY THEY ALL CRIED TOGETHER IF GIRLS AMUSED THEMSELVES LIKE THAT WHAT FUN YOU'D MAKE OF US SAID THE PRACTICAL NORA
6064-56165-0015 OH IT GIVES A FELLOW A CHANCE TO SHOW WHAT KIND OF STUFF HE'S MADE OF EXPLAINED PHILIP WHETHER HE HAS GOOD MANNERS AND WHETHER HE'S CLEVER AND ALL THAT THERE MUST BE BETTER WAYS OF SHOWING BRAVERY
6064-56165-0016 SAID THE PRACTICAL EDITH I DON'T BELIEVE YOU KNOW A BIT MORE ABOUT WILL HARDON'S BRAVERY THAN YOU DID BEFORE WE KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT HIS MANNERS WHAT WHY WHEN HE SAW WHERE HE WAS HE DIDN'T RUN AWAY OR FLUNK OUT
6064-56165-0017 HE ONLY LOOKED A LITTLE SHEEPISH THE OTHER FELLOWS SAID
6064-56165-0018 HE WALKED OFF AS NICE AS YOU PLEASE WASN'T HE MAD AT THE TWO FELLOWS FOR TAKING HIM THERE OF COURSE NOT THAT'S A PART OF THE THING WHY THERE ARE FELLOWS IN CAMBRIDGE WHO WOULD GO THROUGH FIRE AND WATER
6064-56165-0019 OR STAND ON THEIR HEADS IN FRONT OF A PULPIT FOR THE SAKE OF GETTING INTO THE DICKY I TELL YOU WE MAKE SOME OF THEM SUFFER
6064-56165-0020 ALTHOUGH HE HAD BELONGED TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS ORGANIZATION A VERY SHORT TIME WELL I THINK YOU'RE PERFECTLY HORRID CRIED BRENDA I MEAN THE DICKY I'VE HEARD ABOUT THE WAY YOU MAKE PEOPLE SUFFER BRANDING THEM WITH HOT CIGARS AND MAKING THEM RUN BAREFOOT WINTER NIGHTS AND
6064-56165-0021 THERE ARE A LOT OF GIRLS STUDYING IN CAMBRIDGE NOW AT THE ANNEX AND THE FELLOWS DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL WELL I DECLARE EXCLAIMED NORA I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT DIFFERENCE IT MAKES TO THEM
6064-56165-0022 OH THEY HATE TO SEE THESE GIRLS GOING ABOUT WITH BOOKS AND TRYING TO GET INTO HARVARD YES TRYING TO BREAK DOWN THE WALLS SAID NORA SARCASTICALLY
6064-56165-0023 OH SEE HERE IT WOULD JUST SPOIL EVERYTHING TO HAVE WOMEN IN THE CLASSES WITH US ARE YOU AFRAID THEY'D GET AHEAD OF YOU ASKED EDITH GENTLY NOW LOOK HERE EDITH
6064-56165-0024 INTERRUPTED PHILIP I'VE HEARD THAT SOME PROFESSORS SAY THAT THEIR ANNEX CLASSES DO BETTER WORK THAN OURS BUT ANYBODY CAN TELL THAT THAT'S ALL ROT I BELIEVE IT'S ALL PERFECTLY TRUE SAID NORA
6064-56165-0025 WELL I WISH MYSELF THAT OUR ENGLISH INSTRUCTOR HADN'T SUCH A FONDNESS FOR READING THEMES TO US THAT THE GIRLS HAVE WRITTEN HE MAKES OUT THAT THEY ARE BETTER THAN OURS BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT I SEE IT MYSELF WHO GETS THE BEST MARKS
6064-56165-0026 DOES JULIA WEAR GLASSES OR LOOK GREEN I BEG YOUR PARDON BRENDA NO SHE DOESN'T SAID NORA SHORTLY SHE'S ABOUT THE NICEST GIRL I KNOW OH SHE IS LOVELY ADDED EDITH
6064-56165-0027 A MATTER OF OPINION MURMURED BELLE UNDER HER BREATH YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER CRIED BRENDA IN SURPRISE NO I HAVEN'T HAPPENED TO ANSWERED PHILIP
6064-56165-0028 SHE'S INVITED TO MY COOKING PARTY NEXT WEEK SAID NORA YOU KNOW THAT YOU'VE ACCEPTED TOO SO YOU'LL SEE HER OH YES BY THE WAY SAID PHILIP WHAT EVENING IS IT FRIDAY OF COURSE REPLIED NORA
6064-56165-0029 SO WE CAN SIT UP LATE WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT SCHOOL THE NEXT DAY WELL YOU'LL SEE ME SURE SAID PHILIP BUT SEE HERE IT'S FIVE O'CLOCK NOW AND I HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT DOWN TOWN
6064-56165-0030 PHILIP HURRIED OFF BOWING IN A VERY GROWN UP WAY TO THE GROUP OF GIRLS FOR WHATEVER CRITICISMS ANY ONE MIGHT MAKE ABOUT PHILIP'S INDOLENCE AND DISINCLINATION TO STUDY NO ONE COULD DENY THAT HE HAD VERY GOOD MANNERS
6064-56165-0031 THOUGH ONLY ABOUT FOUR YEARS THEIR SENIOR HE SEEMED MUCH OLDER THAN BRENDA AND HER FRIENDS YEARS BEFORE THEY HAD ALL BEEN PLAYMATES TOGETHER BUT HIS TWO YEARS IN COLLEGE HAD TAKEN HIM AWAY FROM THEM
6064-56165-0032 AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT HE CONDESCENDED TO SPEND AS LONG A TIME IN THEIR PRESENCE AS HAD BEEN THE CASE THIS AFTERNOON DO YOU THINK THAT PHILIP LOOKS VERY WELL EDITH
6064-56165-0033 REPLIED PHILIP'S SISTER IT SEEMED TO ME HE WAS JUST A LITTLE PALE HE IS ALWAYS PALE SAID EDITH DO YOU SUPPOSE HE SITS UP TOO LATE ASKED BRENDA I'LL WARRANT HE DOESN'T STUDY TOO MUCH SAID BELLE
6064-56165-0034 HOW CAN YOU CRITICISE EDITH'S BROTHER DON'T LET HER DO IT EDITH IT DOESN'T TROUBLE ME ANSWERED THE PLACID EDITH I KNOW ALL ABOUT PHILIP AND HE'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME THAT'S RIGHT SAID NORA
6064-56165-0035 HE SAYS THERE ARE TWO OR THREE FELLOWS JUST SPONGING OFF OF PHILIP ALL THE TIME AND PHILIP IS TOO GOOD NATURED TO SAY ANYTHING I WONDER HOW HE'LL LIKE JULIA SAID EDITH
6064-56165-0036 HASTILY INTERPOSED BELLE BOYS NEVER LIKE A GIRL WHO STUDIES ESPECIALLY ONE WHO IS GOING TO COLLEGE WELL JULIA IS JUST THE NICEST GIRL I KNOW SAID NORA REPEATING THE WORDS SHE HAD USED TO PHILIP
6064-56168-0000 FOR A WEEK BEFORE THANKSGIVING THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT AMONG THE SCHOOLGIRLS ON ACCOUNT OF THE APPROACHING FOOTBALL GAME THE FOUR WERE AS EXCITED AS THE OTHERS ALTHOUGH NOT SO MANY OF THEIR OWN PARTICULAR FRIENDS WERE IN THE HARVARD TEAM
6064-56168-0001 IT WAS TO BE A GAME WITH PRINCETON ONE OF THE GREAT UNIVERSITY MATCHES AND FOR SPECIAL REASONS THERE WAS THE DEEPEST INTEREST IN THE MATCH THOSE GIRLS WHO HAD BROTHERS IN COLLEGE OR EVEN COUSINS OR FRIENDS HELD THEMSELVES WITH MORE DIGNITY THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS
6064-56168-0002 AND THOSE WHO HAD RELATIVES IN THE TEAM WERE TOO PROUD FOR ANYTHING AS BRENDA SAID THE GAME WAS TO BE PLAYED IN HOLMES FIELD AND TICKETS WERE NOT EASY TO GET BECAUSE THE SEATS WERE FAR LESS NUMEROUS THAN NOW ON THE GREAT SOLDIERS FIELD
6064-56168-0003 THE GIRLS WERE MAKING UP LITTLE GROUPS TO GO TO THE GAME WITH YOUTHS OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE AS ESCORTS UNDER THE CHAPERONAGE OF OLDER PEOPLE A FEW WHO HAD RECEIVED NO INVITATION WERE ESPECIALLY MISERABLE AND TOOK NO TROUBLE TO DISGUISE THEIR FEELINGS
6064-56168-0004 WHO HAD NOT BEEN INVITED ELSEWHERE TO GO IN SOME OTHER PARTY NOW EDITH WAS OF A GENERALLY GENEROUS DISPOSITION AND NOT INCLINED TO LIMIT HER FAVORS OF WHATEVER NATURE TO ANY PARTICULAR SET OF GIRLS
6064-56168-0005 AND EVEN OCCASIONALLY FROM BRENDA BOTH OF WHOM WERE INCLINED TO BE MORE EXCLUSIVE SO IT HAPPENED THAT THE GENERAL HARMONY OF THE FOUR WAS SOMEWHAT DISTURBED WHEN NORA ONE DAY AT RECESS EXCLAIMED WHO DO YOU SUPPOSE IS GOING WITH US TO THE GAME
6064-56168-0006 FOR OF COURSE IN THE MINDS OF THE OTHERS THERE COULD BE BUT ONE GAME
6064-56168-0007 WHY WHO IS IT CRIED BRENDA AND WHO IS IT ECHOED BELLE I KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T GUESS OH DON'T BE SILLY NORA IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH WHILE TO GUESS ABOUT SOMETHING YOU'LL KNOW ALL ABOUT SO SOON
6064-56168-0008 EXCEPT THAT YOU SPEAK AS IF IT WERE SOME ONE WE MIGHT NOT CARE TO HAVE AND IF THAT'S THE CASE I DECLARE IT'S TOO BAD SAID BELLE IF IT'S ANYTHING LIKE THAT BROKE IN BRENDA RATHER SNAPPISHLY I WILL JUST TELL EDITH WHAT I THINK
6064-56168-0009 IT THAT CRIED NORA DIDN'T I SAY THAT IT WAS A PERSON A GIRL IF I MUST BE MORE DEFINITE RUTH ROBERTS IF I MUST TELL JUST WHO IT IS OH CRIED BELLE AND AH ECHOED BRENDA
6064-56168-0010 YOU NEED NOT LOOK SO SURPRISED REJOINED NORA AND IF YOU TAKE MY ADVICE YOU WILL NOT SAY ANYTHING TO EDITH SHE OUGHT TO HAVE HER OWN WAY IN ARRANGING HER OWN PARTY AND YOU KNOW WHEN SHE MAKES UP HER MIND IT IS OF NO USE TO TALK TO HER ABOUT IT
6064-56168-0011 IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO HAVE JULIA TAGGING ABOUT EVERYWHERE BUT WHY IN THE WORLD WE SHOULD HAVE RUTH ROBERTS WHEN WE NEVER SEE HER ANYWHERE EXCEPT AT SCHOOL I REALLY CANNOT UNDERSTAND AND I DON'T SEE HOW YOU AND NORA CAN LIKE IT EITHER WHY
6064-56168-0012 RUTH ROBERTS IS AS PLEASANT A GIRL AS THERE IS IN SCHOOL AND YET SHE WOULD HAVE A TERRIBLY LONELY TIME IF IT WERE NOT FOR EDITH AND JULIA NOBODY ELSE EVER THINKS OF SPEAKING TO HER WELL WHY SHOULD WE
6064-56168-0013 YES THAT'S WHAT I THINK TOO NORA SMILED PLEASANTLY AND HER EYES LOOKED BRIGHTER THAN EVER UNDER THE RIM OF HER BROWN FELT HAT WITH ITS TRIMMINGS OF LIGHTER BROWN NORA'S TEMPER WAS NOT EASILY RUFFLED
6064-56168-0014 THEN BELLE ADDED A FINAL WORD OH IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS IS ALL JULIA'S DOINGS
6064-56168-0015 BUT I DON'T SEE TURNING RATHER SNAPPISHLY TOWARDS BRENDA WHY THE REST OF US HAVE GOT TO TAKE UP RUTH ROBERTS JUST BECAUSE YOUR COUSIN JULIA IS SO DEVOTED TO HER NOW THIS WAS A LITTLE TOO MUCH EVEN FOR BRENDA
6064-56168-0016 AND ANYWAY I'M THANKFUL TO HAVE JULIA TAKE A FANCY TO ANYBODY IT LEAVES US A GREAT DEAL FREER TO DO AS WE LIKE I SHOULD THINK THAT YOU WOULD SEE THAT YOURSELF OH WELL SAID NORA LAUGHING THE WHOLE THING IS NOT WORTH QUARRELING ABOUT
6064-56168-0017 YES I KNOW BUT STILL THE LEAST SAID THE SOONEST MENDED SAID NORA THOUGH TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH THE QUOTATION DID NOT SOUND ESPECIALLY APPROPRIATE THE LEAST SAID THE SOONEST MENDED
6064-56168-0018 I AM GOING TO CARRY AN ORANGE SCARF AND PERHAPS AN ORANGE FLAG WHAT FOR WHY I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING EXCLAIMED NORA NOR I CRIED BRENDA AT A HARVARD GAME
6064-56168-0019 I SHOULD CALL IT VERY IMPOLITE IF THERE WERE NO ORANGE FLAGS SHOWN AT THE GAME WELL YOU HAVE THE MOST RIDICULOUS IDEAS HASN'T SHE BRENDA BRENDA NODDED ASSENT AND NORA CONTINUED
6064-56168-0020 WHY IT'S A DUTY TO DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO HELP YOUR OWN SIDE I NEVER SAID THAT HARVARD WAS MY SIDE INTERRUPTED BELLE DIDN'T I TELL YOU THAT I HAVE A COUSIN ON THE PRINCETON TEAM YOU'D BETTER NOT SAY ANYTHING OF THAT KIND TO PHILIP
6064-56168-0021 OR TO EDITH EITHER THEY ARE BOTH PERFECTLY DEVOTED TO HARVARD AND THEY EXPECT THEIR PARTY TO GIVE GREAT ENCOURAGEMENT TO THE HARVARD TEAM WHY BELLE I CANNOT IMAGINE YOUR DOING ANYTHING ELSE I'M NOT A CHILD RESPONDED BELLE VERY CROSSLY
6064-56168-0022 WALKING AWAY FROM NORA AND BRENDA I DO NOT NEED TO BE TOLD WHAT TO DO WHAT NORA OR BRENDA MIGHT HAVE ANSWERED I CANNOT SAY FOR HARDLY HAD BELLE DISAPPEARED WITHIN THE HOUSE WHEN EDITH HERSELF APPEARED WITH JULIA AND RUTH
6064-56168-0023 RUTH WAS A PRETTY AND AMIABLE GIRL ABOUT JULIA'S AGE AND THEREFORE A LITTLE OLDER THAN THE FOUR SHE HAD BEEN IN THE SCHOOL FOR TWO YEARS BEFORE THE COMING OF JULIA BUT IN ALL THAT TIME SHE HAD HAD ONLY A SPEAKING ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE OTHER GIRLS
6064-56168-0024 THAT THEY WERE VERY SELFISH IN LEAVING THEIR SCHOOLMATE SO ENTIRELY TO HERSELF IT WAS NOT BECAUSE THEY DID NOT LIKE HER THEY WERE MERELY SO VERY MUCH WRAPPED UP IN THEIR OWN AFFAIRS THAT THEY HARDLY NOTICED THAT SHE WAS OFTEN LEFT TO HERSELF
6064-56168-0025 RUTH LIVED IN THE SUBURBS AND AS BELLE HAD SAID OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL THE OTHER GIRLS SELDOM SAW HER AT RECESS EACH LITTLE GROUP HAD SO MANY PERSONAL THINGS TO TALK ABOUT THAT AN OUTSIDER WOULD HAVE BEEN DECIDEDLY IN THE WAY
6064-56168-0026 AND WOULD PERHAPS HAVE BEEN A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE IN JOINING THEM NO ONE GETS A GREAT DEAL OF ENJOYMENT FROM READING A SINGLE CHAPTER IN THE MIDDLE OF A BOOK AND SO IT IS OFTEN HARD TO BE A MERE LISTENER
6064-56168-0027 WHEN THE TONGUES OF HALF A DOZEN GIRLS ARE VIGOROUSLY DISCUSSING PEOPLE AND EVENTS OF WHICH THE LISTENER HAS NOT THE SLIGHTEST KNOWLEDGE RUTH HERSELF WAS VERY INDEPENDENT
6064-56168-0028 SHE HAD ACQUIRED THE HABIT OF STUDYING DURING RECESS SINCE AFTER SCHOOL SHE SPENT MORE TIME THAN MOST GIRLS OF HER AGE IN OUTDOOR SPORTS IT DID HER NO GREAT HARM TO PASS THE HALF HOUR OF RECESS IN THIS WAY RUTH AS WELL AS JULIA
6064-56168-0029 HAD UNDERTAKEN TO PREPARE FOR COLLEGE AND IT HAD BEEN A GREAT DELIGHT TO HER TO HAVE THE LATTER PLACED WITH HER IN ONE OR TWO SPECIAL CLASSES JULIA'S LIKING FOR HER HAD MADE EDITH TAKE A LITTLE MORE INTEREST IN HER THAN WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE
6064-56168-0030 NO ONE WHO SAW THE HEARTY WAY IN WHICH NORA AND BRENDA GREETED RUTH AS SHE CAME UP WITH EDITH AND JULIA COULD FOR A MOMENT HAVE IMAGINED THAT SHE HAD BEEN UNDER DISCUSSION THE MERCURIAL BRENDA FOR THE MOMENT
6064-56168-0031 WAS SO ANNOYED BY BELLE'S PROPOSED CHAMPIONSHIP OF PRINCETON THAT SHE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY CORDIAL TO RUTH AND ALMOST TO HER OWN SURPRISE FOUND HERSELF URGING RUTH TO COME TO TOWN EARLY ON THE SATURDAY OF THE GAME TO TAKE LUNCHEON WITH HER AND JULIA
6064-56168-0032 THE LATTER EXPRESSED HER THANKS IN A GLANCE TOWARDS HER COUSIN AS RUTH ACCEPTED VERY GRACEFULLY AND NORA EXCLAIMED WHAT FUN WE ARE GOING TO HAVE
6064-56168-0033 OH DEAR I CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR SATURDAY I KNOW IT REPLIED BRENDA IT'S LESS THAN A WEEK TOO BUT IT SEEMS AN AWFULLY LONG TIME
6078-54007-0000 ILL LUCK AND THE FIDDLER ONCE UPON A TIME SAINT NICHOLAS CAME DOWN INTO THE WORLD TO TAKE A PEEP AT THE OLD PLACE AND SEE HOW THINGS LOOKED IN THE SPRING TIME ON HE STEPPED ALONG THE ROAD TO THE TOWN WHERE HE USED TO LIVE
6078-54007-0001 FOR HE HAD A NOTION TO FIND OUT WHETHER THINGS WERE GOING ON NOWADAYS AS THEY ONE TIME DID BY AND BY HE CAME TO A CROSS ROAD AND WHO SHOULD HE SEE SITTING THERE BUT ILL LUCK HIMSELF ILL LUCK'S FACE WAS AS GRAY AS ASHES
6078-54007-0002 AND HIS HAIR AS WHITE AS SNOW
6078-54007-0003 AND TWO GREAT WINGS GREW OUT OF HIS SHOULDERS FOR HE FLIES FAST AND COMES QUICKLY TO THOSE WHOM HE VISITS DOES ILL LUCK
6078-54007-0004 WHICH HE KEPT CRACKING AND EATING AS HE TRUDGED ALONG THE ROAD AND JUST THEN HE CAME UPON ONE WITH A WORM HOLE IN IT WHEN HE SAW ILL LUCK IT CAME INTO HIS HEAD TO DO A GOOD TURN TO POOR SORROWFUL MAN GOOD MORNING ILL LUCK SAYS HE
6078-54007-0005 EVEN IF IT BE THROUGH A KEY HOLE NOW IS THAT SO YES SAYS ILL LUCK IT IS WELL LOOK NOW FRIEND SAYS SAINT NICHOLAS
6078-54007-0006 YES SAYS ILL LUCK I COULD INDEED I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU SAYS SAINT NICHOLAS FOR THEN I SHOULD BE OF A MIND TO BELIEVE WHAT PEOPLE SAY OF YOU WELL SAYS ILL LUCK I HAVE NOT MUCH TIME TO BE POTTERING AND PLAYING UPON JACK'S FIDDLE BUT TO OBLIGE AN OLD FRIEND
6078-54007-0007 THEN WHAT DO YOU THINK SAINT NICHOLAS DID
6078-54007-0008 AND NO SOONER HAD ILL LUCK ENTERED THE NUT THAN HE STUCK THE PLUG IN THE HOLE AND THERE WAS MAN'S ENEMY
6078-54007-0009 SO SAYS SAINT NICHOLAS THAT'S A PIECE OF WORK WELL DONE THEN HE TOSSED THE HAZEL NUT UNDER THE ROOTS OF AN OAK TREE NEAR BY AND WENT HIS WAY AND THAT IS HOW THIS STORY BEGINS WELL
6078-54007-0010 NOBODY MET WITH ILL LUCK BUT ONE DAY WHO SHOULD COME TRAVELLING THAT WAY
6078-54007-0011 AND PHST POP OUT CAME ILL LUCK ALONG WITH IT PLAGUE TAKE THE FIDDLER SAY I LISTEN SAYS ILL LUCK IT HAS BEEN MANY A LONG DAY THAT I HAVE BEEN IN THAT HAZEL NUT AND YOU ARE THE MAN THAT HAS LET ME OUT
6078-54007-0012 FOR ONCE IN A WAY I WILL DO A GOOD TURN TO A POOR HUMAN BODY THEREWITH AND WITHOUT GIVING THE FIDDLER TIME TO SPEAK A WORD ILL LUCK CAUGHT HIM UP BY THE BELT AND WHIZ AWAY HE FLEW LIKE A BULLET
6078-54007-0013 THEN AWAY HE FLEW TO ATTEND TO OTHER MATTERS OF GREATER NEED WHEN THE FIDDLER HAD GATHERED HIS WITS TOGETHER AND HIMSELF TO HIS FEET HE SAW THAT HE LAY IN A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN OF FLOWERS AND FRUIT TREES AND MARBLE WALKS AND WHAT NOT
6078-54007-0014 ALL BUILT OF WHITE MARBLE WITH A FOUNTAIN IN FRONT AND PEACOCKS STRUTTING ABOUT ON THE LAWN WELL THE FIDDLER SMOOTHED DOWN HIS HAIR AND BRUSHED HIS CLOTHES A BIT AND OFF HE WENT TO SEE WHAT WAS TO BE SEEN AT THE GRAND HOUSE AT THE END OF THE GARDEN
6078-54007-0015 HE ENTERED THE DOOR AND NOBODY SAID NO TO HIM THEN HE PASSED THROUGH ONE ROOM AFTER ANOTHER AND EACH WAS FINER THAN THE ONE HE LEFT BEHIND MANY SERVANTS STOOD AROUND BUT THEY ONLY BOWED AND NEVER ASKED WHENCE HE CAME
6078-54007-0016 THE TABLE WAS SPREAD WITH A FEAST THAT SMELLED SO GOOD THAT IT BROUGHT TEARS TO THE FIDDLER'S EYES AND WATER TO HIS MOUTH AND ALL THE PLATES WERE OF PURE GOLD THE LITTLE OLD MAN SAT ALONE BUT ANOTHER PLACE WAS SPREAD
6078-54007-0017 DO NOT SAY THAT SIT DOWN TO THE TABLE AND EAT AND WHEN I HAVE TOLD YOU ALL YOU WILL SAY IT WAS NOT ILL LUCK BUT GOOD LUCK THAT BROUGHT YOU THE FIDDLER HAD HIS OWN MIND ABOUT THAT BUT ALL THE SAME DOWN HE SAT AT THE TABLE
6078-54007-0018 AND FELL TO WITH KNIFE AND FORK AT THE GOOD THINGS AS THOUGH HE HAD NOT HAD A BITE TO EAT FOR A WEEK OF SUNDAYS I AM THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD SAYS THE LITTLE OLD MAN AFTER A WHILE I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT SAYS THE FIDDLER YOU MAY WELL BE SAID THE OLD MAN
6078-54007-0019 AND WITHOUT WIFE OR CHILD AND THIS MORNING I SAID TO MYSELF THAT THE FIRST BODY THAT CAME TO MY HOUSE I WOULD TAKE FOR A SON OR A DAUGHTER AS THE CASE MIGHT BE YOU ARE THE FIRST
6078-54007-0020 AND SO YOU SHALL LIVE WITH ME AS LONG AS I LIVE AND AFTER I AM GONE EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE SHALL BE YOURS THE FIDDLER DID NOTHING BUT STARE WITH OPEN EYES AND MOUTH AS THOUGH HE WOULD NEVER SHUT EITHER AGAIN
6078-54007-0021 EVERYTHING THE FIDDLER WANTED CAME TO HIS HAND HE LIVED HIGH AND SLEPT SOFT AND WARM AND NEVER KNEW WHAT IT WAS TO WANT EITHER MORE OR LESS OR GREAT OR SMALL IN ALL OF THOSE THREE OR FOUR DAYS HE DID NOTHING BUT ENJOY HIMSELF
6078-54007-0022 WITH MIGHT AND MAIN BUT BY AND BY HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHERE ALL THE GOOD THINGS CAME FROM THEN BEFORE LONG HE FELL TO PESTERING THE OLD MAN WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MATTER AT FIRST THE OLD MAN PUT HIM OFF WITH SHORT ANSWERS
6078-54007-0023 BUT THE FIDDLER WAS A MASTER HAND AT FINDING OUT ANYTHING HE WANTED TO KNOW HE DINNED AND DRUMMED AND WORRIED UNTIL FLESH AND BLOOD COULD STAND IT NO LONGER SO AT LAST THE OLD MAN SAID THAT HE WOULD SHOW HIM THE TREASURE HOUSE WHERE ALL HIS WEALTH CAME FROM
6078-54007-0024 AND AT THAT THE FIDDLER WAS TICKLED BEYOND MEASURE
6078-54007-0025 THERE IN A CORNER BY THE WALL WAS A GREAT TRAP DOOR OF IRON THE OLD MAN FITTED THE KEY TO THE LOCK AND TURNED IT HE LIFTED THE DOOR AND THEN WENT DOWN A STEEP FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS AND THE FIDDLER FOLLOWED CLOSE AT HIS HEELS
6078-54007-0026 DOWN BELOW IT WAS AS LIGHT AS DAY FOR IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM HUNG A GREAT LAMP THAT SHONE WITH A BRIGHT LIGHT
6078-54007-0027 YOU MUST NEVER OPEN THAT DOOR YONDER AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM SHOULD YOU DO SO ILL LUCK WILL BE SURE TO OVERTAKE YOU OH NO THE FIDDLER WOULD NEVER THINK OF DOING SUCH A THING AS OPENING THE DOOR
6078-54007-0028 AND OUT INTO THE SUNLIGHT AGAIN IT TOOK HIM MAYBE AN HOUR TO COUNT ALL THE MONEY AND JEWELS HE HAD BROUGHT UP WITH HIM AFTER HE HAD DONE THAT HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT WAS INSIDE OF THE LITTLE DOOR AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM FIRST HE WONDERED
6078-54007-0029 PERHAPS I CAN SEE WHAT IS THERE WITHOUT OPENING THE DOOR SO DOWN HE TOOK THE KEY AND OFF HE MARCHED TO THE GARDEN HE OPENED THE TRAP DOOR AND WENT DOWN THE STEEP STEPS TO THE ROOM BELOW THERE WAS THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE ROOM
6078-54007-0030 BUT WHEN HE CAME TO LOOK THERE WAS NO KEY HOLE TO IT
6078-54007-0031 HE HEARD A SOUND LIKE THE WAVES BEATING ON THE SHORE WELL SAYS HE THIS IS THE MOST CURIOUS THING I HAVE SEEN FOR A LONG TIME SINCE I HAVE COME SO FAR I MAY AS WELL SEE THE END OF IT
6078-54007-0032 SO HE ENTERED THE PASSAGEWAY AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM HE WENT ON AND ON AND THE SPARK OF LIGHT KEPT GROWING LARGER AND LARGER AND BY AND BY POP OUT HE CAME AT THE OTHER END OF THE PASSAGE SURE ENOUGH
6078-54007-0033 THERE HE STOOD ON THE SEA SHORE WITH THE WAVES BEATING AND DASHING ON THE ROCKS HE STOOD LOOKING AND WONDERING TO FIND HIMSELF IN SUCH A PLACE WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMETHING CAME WITH A WHIZ AND A RUSH AND CAUGHT HIM BY THE BELT AND AWAY HE FLEW LIKE A BULLET
6078-54007-0034 BY AND BY HE MANAGED TO SCREW HIS HEAD AROUND AND LOOK UP AND THERE IT WAS ILL LUCK THAT HAD HIM I THOUGHT SO SAID THE FIDDLER AND THEN HE GAVE OVER KICKING WELL ON AND ON THEY FLEW OVER HILL AND VALLEY OVER MOOR AND MOUNTAIN
6078-54007-0035 UNTIL THEY CAME TO ANOTHER GARDEN AND THERE ILL LUCK LET THE FIDDLER DROP SWASH DOWN HE FELL INTO THE TOP OF AN APPLE TREE AND THERE HE HUNG IN THE BRANCHES IT WAS THE GARDEN OF A ROYAL CASTLE
6078-54007-0036 AND ALL HAD BEEN WEEPING AND WOE THOUGH THEY WERE BEGINNING NOW TO PICK UP THEIR SMILES AGAIN AND THIS WAS THE REASON WHY THE KING OF THAT COUNTRY HAD DIED AND NO ONE WAS LEFT BEHIND HIM BUT THE QUEEN
6078-54007-0037 AND SO SHE HAD COME OUT INTO THE GARDEN FOR A BIT OF REST AND THERE SHE SAT UNDER THE SHADE OF AN APPLE TREE FANNING HERSELF AND CRYING WHEN SWASH DOWN FELL THE FIDDLER INTO THE APPLE TREE AND DOWN FELL A DOZEN APPLES
6078-54007-0038 YOU FELL FROM HEAVEN FOR I SAW IT WITH MY EYES AND HEARD IT WITH MY EARS I SEE HOW IT IS NOW YOU WERE SENT HITHER FROM HEAVEN TO BE MY HUSBAND AND MY HUSBAND YOU SHALL BE YOU SHALL BE KING OF THIS COUNTRY HALF AND HALF WITH ME AS QUEEN
6078-54007-0039 AND SHALL SIT ON A THRONE BESIDE ME YOU CAN GUESS WHETHER OR NOT THAT WAS MUSIC TO THE FIDDLER'S EARS SO THE PRINCES WERE SENT PACKING AND THE FIDDLER WAS MARRIED TO THE QUEEN AND REIGNED IN THAT COUNTRY WELL THREE OR FOUR DAYS PASSED
6078-54007-0040 AND ALL WAS AS SWEET AND HAPPY AS A SPRING DAY BUT AT THE END OF THAT TIME THE FIDDLER BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT WAS TO BE SEEN IN THE CASTLE THE QUEEN WAS VERY FOND OF HIM AND WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO SHOW HIM ALL THE FINE THINGS THAT WERE TO BE SEEN
6078-54007-0041 YOU MUST NOT ASK OR WISH TO KNOW SHOULD YOU OPEN THAT DOOR ILL LUCK WILL BE SURE TO OVERTAKE YOU POOH SAID THE FIDDLER I DON'T CARE TO KNOW ANYHOW AND OFF THEY WENT HAND IN HAND YES
6078-54007-0042 THAT WAS A VERY FINE THING TO SAY BUT BEFORE AN HOUR HAD GONE BY THE FIDDLER'S HEAD BEGAN TO HUM AND BUZZ LIKE A BEEHIVE I DON'T BELIEVE SAID HE THERE WOULD BE A GRAIN OF HARM IN MY PEEPING INSIDE THAT DOOR ALL THE SAME
6078-54007-0043 WHY LOOK SAYS HE IT IS JUST LIKE THE DOOR AT THE RICH MAN'S HOUSE OVER YONDER I WONDER IF IT IS THE SAME INSIDE AS OUTSIDE AND HE OPENED THE DOOR AND PEEPED IN YES THERE WAS THE LONG PASSAGE
6078-54007-0044 AND THE SPARK OF LIGHT AT THE FAR END AS THOUGH THE SUN WERE SHINING HE COCKED HIS HEAD TO ONE SIDE AND LISTENED YES SAID HE I THINK I HEAR THE WATER RUSHING BUT I AM NOT SURE I WILL JUST GO A LITTLE FURTHER IN
6078-54007-0045 AND LISTEN AND SO HE ENTERED AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM WELL HE WENT ON AND ON UNTIL POP THERE HE WAS OUT AT THE FARTHER END AND BEFORE HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS ABOUT HE HAD STEPPED OUT UPON THE SEA SHORE
6078-54007-0046 AWAY FLEW THE FIDDLER LIKE A BULLET AND THERE WAS ILL LUCK CARRYING HIM BY THE BELT AGAIN AWAY THEY SPED
6078-54007-0047 UNTIL THE FIDDLER'S HEAD GREW SO DIZZY THAT HE HAD TO SHUT HIS EYES SUDDENLY ILL LUCK LET HIM DROP AND DOWN HE FELL THUMP BUMP ON THE HARD GROUND THEN HE OPENED HIS EYES AND SAT UP
6078-54007-0048 OR ELSE I WOULD HAVE BEEN A KING IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR ILL LUCK AND THAT IS THE WAY WE ALL OF US TALK DOCTOR FAUSTUS HAD SAT ALL THE WHILE NEITHER DRINKING ALE NOR SMOKING TOBACCO BUT WITH HIS HANDS FOLDED AND IN SILENCE
6078-54007-0049 I KNOW NOT WHY IT IS SAID HE BUT THAT STORY OF YOURS MY FRIEND BRINGS TO MY MIND A STORY OF A MAN WHOM I ONCE KNEW A GREAT MAGICIAN IN HIS TIME AND A NECROMANCER AND A CHEMIST AND AN ALCHEMIST
6078-54007-0050 AND A RHETORICIAN AN ASTRONOMER AN ASTROLOGER AND A PHILOSOPHER AS WELL TIS A LONG LIST OF EXCELLENCY SAID OLD BIDPAI
6078-54007-0051 NAY SAID SAINT GEORGE EVERYTHING MUST HAVE A NAME IT HATH NO NAME SAID DOCTOR FAUSTUS BUT I SHALL GIVE IT A NAME AND IT SHALL BE
6078-54013-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A SERVANT WHO SERVED A WISE MAN
6078-54013-0001 DAY AFTER DAY TIME IN AND TIME OUT FOR SEVEN YEARS IN THOSE YEARS THE SERVANT WAS WELL ENOUGH CONTENTED BUT NO ONE LIKES TO ABIDE IN THE SAME PLACE FOREVER AND SO ONE DAY HE TOOK IT INTO HIS HEAD THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD
6078-54013-0002 TO SEE WHAT KIND OF A FORTUNE A MAN MIGHT MAKE THERE FOR HIMSELF
6078-54013-0003 YOU HAVE SERVED ME FAITHFULLY THESE SEVEN YEARS GONE AND NOW THAT YOU ASK LEAVE TO GO YOU SHALL GO BUT IT IS LITTLE OR NOTHING IN THE WAY OF MONEY THAT I CAN GIVE YOU AND SO YOU WILL HAVE TO BE CONTENT WITH WHAT I CAN AFFORD
6078-54013-0004 SEE HERE IS A LITTLE PEBBLE AND ITS LIKE IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN THE SEVEN KINGDOMS FOR WHOEVER HOLDS IT IN HIS MOUTH CAN HEAR WHILE HE DOES SO
6078-54013-0005 PAYING HIS WAY WITH THE FEW PENNIES HE HAD SAVED IN HIS SEVEN YEARS OF SERVICE BUT FOR ALL OF HIS TRAVELLING NOTHING OF GOOD HAPPENED TO HIM UNTIL ONE MORNING HE CAME TO A LONELY PLACE WHERE THERE STOOD A GALLOWS AND THERE HE SAT HIM DOWN TO REST
6078-54013-0006 AND IT IS JUST IN SUCH AN UNLIKELY PLACE AS THIS THAT A MAN'S BEST CHANCE OF FORTUNE COMES TO HIM SOMETIMES AS THE SERVANT SAT THERE THERE CAME TWO RAVENS FLYING AND LIT UPON THE CROSS BEAM OVERHEAD
6078-54013-0007 THERE THEY BEGAN TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER AND THE SERVANT POPPED THE PEBBLE INTO HIS MOUTH TO HEAR WHAT THEY MIGHT SAY YONDER IS A TRAVELLER IN THE WORLD SAID THE FIRST RAVEN YES SAID THE SECOND
6078-54013-0008 WHY THUS SAID THE SECOND
6078-54013-0009 AND THERE HE WOULD FIND A MAN SITTING
6078-54013-0010 THAT MAN WOULD LEAD HIM TO THE GARDEN
6078-54013-0011 THE FRUIT OF HAPPINESS SAID THE FIRST RAVEN AND OF WHAT USE WOULD THE FRUIT OF HAPPINESS BE TO HIM
6078-54013-0012 AND WISH AND WHATEVER ONE ASKS FOR ONE SHALL HAVE YOU MAY GUESS THAT WHEN THE SERVANT UNDERSTOOD THE TALK OF THE RAVENS HE WAS NOT SLOW IN MAKING USE OF WHAT HE HEARD UP HE SCRAMBLED
6078-54013-0013 AND AWAY HE WENT AS FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD CARRY HIM ON AND ON HE TRAVELLED UNTIL HE CAME TO THE CROSS ROADS AND THE STONE CROSS OF WHICH THE RAVEN SPOKE AND THERE SURE ENOUGH SAT THE TRAVELLER
6078-54013-0014 THERE IS ONE CONDITION YOU MUST FULFIL MANY STRANGE THINGS WILL HAPPEN UPON OUR JOURNEY BETWEEN HERE AND THERE
6078-54013-0015 AND SAY NOT A WORD DO YOU AGREE TO THAT YES SAID THE SERVANT I DO VERY WELL SAID HIS NEW COMRADE THEN LET US BE JOGGING
6078-54013-0016 AND THE TIME IS NONE TOO LONG TO GET THERE SO ALL THE REST OF THAT DAY THEY JOURNEYED ONWARD TOGETHER UNTIL TOWARDS EVENING THEY CAME TO A TOWN WITH HIGH TOWERS AND STEEP ROOFS AND TALL SPIRES
6078-54013-0017 THE SERVANT'S COMPANION ENTERED THE GATE AS THOUGH HE KNEW THE PLACE RIGHT WELL AND LED THE WAY UP ONE STREET AND DOWN ANOTHER UNTIL BY AND BY THEY CAME TO A NOBLE HOUSE THAT STOOD A LITTLE APART BY ITSELF WITH GARDENS OF FLOWERS AND FRUIT TREES ALL AROUND IT
6078-54013-0018 THERE THE TRAVELLING COMPANION STOPPED AND DRAWING OUT A LITTLE PIPE FROM UNDER HIS JACKET
6078-54013-0019 TO LISTEN TO THE MUSIC WELL HE PLAYED AND PLAYED UNTIL BY AND BY THE DOOR OPENED AND OUT CAME A SERVING MAN HO PIPER SAID HE
6078-54013-0020 WHERE DOZENS OF SERVANTS WERE SERVING A FINE FEAST BUT ONLY ONE MAN SAT AT TABLE A YOUNG MAN WITH A FACE SO SORROWFUL THAT IT MADE A BODY'S HEART ACHE TO LOOK UPON HIM CAN YOU PLAY GOOD MUSIC PIPER SAID HE
6078-54013-0021 BUT SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WENT WRONG HIS WIFE AND HE FELL OUT AND QUARRELLED UNTIL THERE WAS NO LIVING TOGETHER AND SHE HAD TO GO BACK TO HER OLD HOME THEN HIS COMPANIONS DESERTED HIM AND NOW HE LIVED ALL ALONE YOURS IS A HARD CASE SAID THE TRAVELLING COMPANION
6078-54013-0022 THEREUPON HE DREW OUT HIS PIPES AND BEGAN TO PLAY AND IT WAS SUCH A TUNE AS NO MAN EVER LISTENED TO BEFORE HE PLAYED AND HE PLAYED AND AFTER A WHILE ONE AFTER ANOTHER OF THOSE WHO LISTENED TO HIM BEGAN TO GET DROWSY FIRST THEY WINKED
6078-54013-0023 THEN THEY SHUT THEIR EYES AND THEN THEY NODDED UNTIL ALL WERE AS DUMB AS LOGS AND AS SOUND ASLEEP AS THOUGH THEY WOULD NEVER WAKEN AGAIN ONLY THE SERVANT AND THE PIPER STAYED AWAKE FOR THE MUSIC DID NOT MAKE THEM DROWSY AS IT DID THE REST
6078-54013-0024 THEN WHEN ALL BUT THEY TWO WERE TIGHT AND FAST ASLEEP
6078-54013-0025 AND STEPPING UP TO THE YOUNG MAN TOOK FROM OFF HIS FINGER A SPLENDID RUBY RING AS RED AS BLOOD AND AS BRIGHT AS FIRE AND POPPED THE SAME INTO HIS POCKET AND ALL THE WHILE THE SERVING MAN STOOD GAPING LIKE A FISH
6078-54013-0026 TO SEE WHAT HIS COMRADE WAS ABOUT
6078-54013-0027 NONE WAS MORE UGLY THAN THIS TO BEWITCH THE POOR SORROWFUL YOUNG MAN INTO A SLEEP AND THEN TO ROB HIM OF HIS RUBY RING
6078-54013-0028 BUT THE NEXT DAY THEY JOGGED ON TOGETHER AGAIN UNTIL BY AND BY THEY CAME TO A GREAT FOREST THERE THEY WANDERED UP AND DOWN TILL NIGHT CAME UPON THEM AND FOUND THEM STILL STUMBLING ONWARD THROUGH THE DARKNESS
6078-54013-0029 HE SEEMED TO DOUBT NOTHING NOR FEAR NOTHING BUT TRUDGED STRAIGHT AHEAD UNTIL BY AND BY THEY SAW A LIGHT TWINKLING FAR AWAY AND WHEN THEY CAME TO IT THEY FOUND A GLOOMY STONE HOUSE AS UGLY AS EYES EVER LOOKED UPON
6078-54013-0030 UP STEPPED THE SERVANT'S COMRADE AND KNOCKED UPON THE DOOR RAP TAP TAP BY AND BY IT WAS OPENED A CRACK AND THERE STOOD AN UGLY OLD WOMAN BLEAR EYED AND CROOKED AND GNARLED AS A WINTER TWIG
6078-54013-0031 NO MATTER FOR THAT SAID THE TRAVELLING COMPANION WE CAN GO NO FARTHER TO NIGHT SO YOU MUST LET US IN AND HIDE US AS BEST YOU MAY AND IN HE WENT AS HE SAID WITH THE SERVANT AT HIS HEELS
6078-54013-0032 TREMBLING LIKE A LEAF AT WHAT HE HAD HEARD THE OLD WOMAN GAVE THEM SOME BREAD AND MEAT TO EAT AND THEN HID THEM AWAY IN THE GREAT EMPTY MEAL CHEST IN THE CORNER AND THERE THEY LAY AS STILL AS MICE
6078-54013-0033 BY AND BY IN CAME THE GANG OF THIEVES WITH A GREAT NOISE AND UPROAR AND DOWN THEY SAT TO THEIR SUPPER
6078-54013-0034 HOW THEY HAD CRUELLY ROBBED AND MURDERED POOR PEOPLE
6078-54013-0035 HE DREW FROM HIS POCKET THE RUBY RING WHICH HE HAD STOLEN FROM THE SORROWFUL YOUNG MAN'S FINGER
6078-54013-0036 THEN HE LED THE WAY OUT OF THE HOUSE AND IF THE SERVING MAN HAD WONDERED THE DAY BEFORE AT THAT WHICH THE COMRADE DID HE WONDERED TEN TIMES MORE TO SEE HIM GIVE SO BEAUTIFUL A RING
6078-54013-0037 THE TWO TRAVELLERS CAME TO A LITTLE HUT NEAT ENOUGH
6078-54013-0038 AND THERE THE COMRADE KNOCKED UPON THE DOOR AND ASKED FOR LODGING
6078-54013-0039 NEVERTHELESS THEY MADE THE TRAVELLERS WELCOME AND SET BEFORE THEM THE VERY BEST THAT WAS TO BE HAD IN THE HOUSE AND AFTER BOTH HAD EATEN AND DRUNK THEY SHOWED THEM TO BED IN A CORNER AS CLEAN AS SNOW AND THERE THEY SLEPT THE NIGHT THROUGH
6078-54013-0040 BUT THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE DAWNING OF THE DAY THE TRAVELLING COMPANION WAS STIRRING AGAIN
6078-54013-0041 FOR I HAVE A BIT OF WORK TO DO BEFORE I LEAVE THIS PLACE AND STRANGE WORK IT WAS
6078-54013-0042 HE GATHERED TOGETHER A GREAT HEAP OF STRAW AND STICKS OF WOOD AND STUFFED ALL UNDER THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE THEN HE STRUCK A LIGHT AND SET FIRE TO IT
6078-54013-0043 ALL WAS A RED BLAZE BEHIND THEM
6078-54013-0044 ON THEY JOGGED AND BY THE TIME EVENING WAS AT HAND THEY HAD COME TO A NEAT COTTAGE
6078-54013-0045 IN THIS COTTAGE LIVED A WIDOW AND HER ONLY SON AND THEY ALSO MADE THE TRAVELLERS WELCOME AND SET BEFORE THEM A GOOD SUPPER AND SHOWED THEM TO A CLEAN BED THIS TIME THE TRAVELLING COMRADE DID NEITHER GOOD NOR ILL TO THOSE OF THE HOUSE
6078-54013-0046 BUT IN THE MORNING HE TOLD THE WIDOW WHITHER THEY WERE GOING AND ASKED IF SHE AND HER SON KNEW THE WAY TO THE GARDEN WHERE GREW THE FRUIT OF HAPPINESS YES SAID SHE THAT WE DO FOR THE GARDEN IS NOT A DAY'S JOURNEY FROM HERE
6078-54013-0047 AND MY SON HIMSELF SHALL GO WITH YOU TO SHOW YOU THE WAY THAT IS GOOD SAID THE SERVANT'S COMRADE AND IF HE WILL DO SO I WILL PAY HIM WELL FOR HIS TROUBLE SO THE YOUNG MAN PUT ON HIS HAT AND TOOK UP HIS STICK
6078-54013-0048 AND OFF WENT THE THREE UP HILL AND DOWN DALE UNTIL BY AND BY THEY CAME OVER THE TOP OF THE LAST HILL AND THERE BELOW THEM LAY THE GARDEN AND WHAT A SIGHT IT WAS THE LEAVES SHINING AND GLISTENING LIKE SO MANY JEWELS IN THE SUNLIGHT
6078-54013-0049 ALL HE COULD DO WAS TO STAND AND LOOK
6078-54013-0050 TORRENT WITHOUT A BRIDGE FOR A BODY TO CROSS OVER YONDER IS WHAT YOU SEEK SAID THE YOUNG MAN POINTING WITH HIS FINGER AND THERE YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF THE FRUIT OF HAPPINESS
6078-54013-0051 BUT SUDDENLY CATCHING THE WIDOW'S SON BY THE COLLAR HE LIFTED HIM AND FLUNG HIM INTO THE BLACK RUSHING WATER SPLASH WENT THE YOUNG MAN AND THEN AWAY HE WENT WHIRLING OVER ROCKS AND WATER FALLS THERE CRIED THE COMRADE
6078-54013-0052 THAT IS YOUR REWARD FOR YOUR SERVICE
6078-54013-0053 HE FOUND HIS TONGUE AT LAST AND ALL THAT HE HAD BOTTLED UP
6078-54013-0054 SUCH ABUSE AS HE SHOWERED UPON HIS TRAVELLING COMPANION NO MAN EVER LISTENED TO BEFORE BUT TO ALL THE SERVANT SAID THE OTHER ANSWERED NEVER A WORD UNTIL HE HAD STOPPED FOR SHEER WANT OF BREATH THEN POOR FOOL SAID THE TRAVELLING COMPANION
6078-54013-0055 THEREUPON AS HE ENDED SPEAKING HE STRUCK HIS STAFF UPON THE GROUND INSTANTLY THE EARTH TREMBLED AND THE SKY DARKENED OVERHEAD UNTIL IT GREW AS BLACK AS NIGHT
6078-54013-0056 THE GARDEN AND THE TORRENT AND ALL WERE GONE AND NOTHING WAS LEFT BUT A NAKED PLAIN COVERED OVER WITH THE BONES OF THOSE WHO HAD COME THAT WAY BEFORE SEEKING THE FRUIT WHICH THE TRAVELLING SERVANT HAD SOUGHT IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE THE SERVANT FOUND HIS WAY BACK INTO THE WORLD AGAIN
6078-54013-0057 BUT WHAT A CHANGE HE BEHELD IT WAS A POOR COTTAGE NO LONGER BUT A SPLENDID PALACE FIT FOR A QUEEN TO DWELL IN
6078-54013-0058 AND SHE WAS DRESSED IN CLOTHES FIT FOR A QUEEN TO WEAR SHINING WITH GOLD AND SILVER AND PRECIOUS STONES THE SERVANT STOOD AND STARED LIKE ONE BEREFT OF WITS
6078-54013-0059 AN ANGEL CAME AND SHOWED THE WAY TO MY SON
6078-54013-0060 BUT TO BRING AN APPLE FOR ME ALSO THEN THE POOR TRAVELLING SERVANT BEGAN TO THUMP HIS HEAD HE SAW WELL ENOUGH THROUGH THE MILLSTONE NOW AND THAT HE TOO MIGHT HAVE HAD ONE OF THE FRUIT IF HE HAD BUT HELD HIS TONGUE A LITTLE LONGER
6078-54013-0061 THE HOUSE THAT HE HAD SEEN THE ANGEL SET FIRE TO THERE HE BEHELD MASONS AND CARPENTERS HARD AT WORK HACKING AND HEWING AND BUILDING A FINE NEW HOUSE AND THERE HE SAW THE POOR MAN HIMSELF STANDING BY GIVING THEM ORDERS HOW IS THIS SAID THE TRAVELLING SERVANT
6078-54013-0062 FOR MANY A LONG DAY AND NEVER KNEW THAT A GREAT TREASURE OF SILVER AND GOLD WAS HIDDEN BENEATH IT UNTIL A FEW DAYS AGO THERE CAME AN ANGEL
6078-54013-0063 THE NEXT MORNING THE POOR SERVANT JOGGED ALONG ON HIS HOMEWARD WAY MORE SAD AND DOWNCAST THAN EVER AND BY EVENING HE HAD COME TO THE ROBBERS DEN IN THE THICK WOODS AND THERE THE OLD WOMAN CAME RUNNING TO THE DOOR TO MEET HIM
6078-54013-0064 HE GAVE IT TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE BAND AND AFTER HE HAD GONE THE ROBBERS FOUGHT FOR IT WITH ONE ANOTHER UNTIL THEY WERE ALL KILLED SO NOW THE WORLD IS RID OF THEM AND TRAVELLERS CAN COME AND GO AS THEY PLEASE BACK JOGGED THE TRAVELLING SERVANT
6078-54013-0065 AND THE NEXT DAY CAME TO THE TOWN AND TO THE HOUSE OF THE SORROWFUL YOUNG MAN THERE LO AND BEHOLD INSTEAD OF BEING DARK AND SILENT AS IT WAS BEFORE ALL WAS ABLAZE WITH LIGHT AND NOISY WITH THE SOUND OF REJOICING AND MERRIMENT
6078-54013-0066 THERE HAPPENED TO BE ONE OF THE HOUSEHOLD STANDING AT THE DOOR AND HE KNEW THE SERVANT AS THE COMPANION OF THAT ONE WHO HAD STOLEN THE RUBY RING UP HE CAME AND LAID HOLD OF THE SERVANT BY THE COLLAR CALLING TO HIS COMPANIONS THAT HE HAD CAUGHT ONE OF THE THIEVES
6078-54013-0067 INTO THE HOUSE THEY HAULED THE POOR SERVANT AND INTO THE SAME ROOM WHERE HE HAD BEEN BEFORE AND THERE SAT THE YOUNG MAN AT A GRAND FEAST WITH HIS WIFE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS AROUND HIM BUT WHEN THE YOUNG MAN SAW THE POOR SERVING MAN HE CAME TO HIM
6078-54013-0068 AND TOOK HIM BY THE HAND AND SET HIM BESIDE HIMSELF AT THE TABLE
6078-54013-0069 IT WAS THE RING OF DISCORD THAT BRED STRIFE WHEREVER IT CAME
6078-54013-0070 MY WIFE AND ALL MY FRIENDS FELL OUT WITH ME AND WE QUARRELLED SO THAT THEY ALL LEFT ME BUT THOUGH I KNEW IT NOT AT THAT TIME YOUR COMRADE WAS AN ANGEL AND TOOK THE RING AWAY WITH HIM AND NOW I AM AS HAPPY AS I WAS SORROWFUL BEFORE
6078-54013-0071 RAP TAP TAP HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND THE WISE MAN WHO HAD BEEN HIS MASTER OPENED TO HIM
6078-54013-0072 VERY WELL SAID THE WISE MAN COME IN AND SHUT THE DOOR AND FOR ALL I KNOW THE TRAVELLING SERVANT IS THERE TO THIS DAY FOR HE IS NOT THE ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD WHO HAS COME IN SIGHT OF THE FRUIT OF HAPPINESS
6078-54013-0073 AND THEN JOGGED ALL THE WAY BACK HOME AGAIN TO COOK CABBAGE AND ONIONS AND POT HERBS AND TO MAKE BROTH FOR WISER MEN THAN HIMSELF TO SUP
6078-54013-0074 NO OFFENCE SAID THE BLACKSMITH I MEANT NOT TO SPEAK ILL OF YOUR STORY COME COME SIR WILL YOU NOT TAKE A POT OF ALE WITH ME WHY SAID SAINT GEORGE SOMEWHAT MOLLIFIED
6078-54013-0075 I WOULD AS LIEF AS NOT I LIKED THE STORY WELL ENOUGH PIPED UP THE LITTLE TAILOR WHO HAD KILLED SEVEN FLIES AT A BLOW TWAS A GOOD ENOUGH STORY OF ITS SORT BUT WHY DOES NOBODY TELL A TALE OF GOOD BIG GIANTS AND OF WILD BOARS AND OF UNICORNS
6078-54013-0076 SUCH AS I KILLED IN MY ADVENTURES YOU WOT OF OLD ALI BABA HAD BEEN SITTING WITH HIS HANDS FOLDED AND HIS EYES CLOSED NOW HE OPENED THEM AND LOOKED AT THE LITTLE TAILOR
6078-54013-0077 WHO WAS AS BIG AS A GIANT AND SIX TIMES AS POWERFUL AND BESIDES THAT HE ADDED
6078-54013-0078 CLATTERED THE BOTTOM OF HIS CANICAN AGAINST THE TABLE
6078-54013-0079 COME FRIEND LET US HAVE IT STOP A BIT SAID FORTUNATUS WHAT IS THIS STORY MOSTLY ABOUT IT IS SAID ALI BABA ABOUT TWO MEN BETWIXT WHOM THERE WAS
6081-41997-0000 HENCE THE DRIVER'S HOPE OF FINDING THEM IN THE RUE DE BOURGOGNE
6081-41997-0001 AND YET HE DID NOT HESITATE TO JUMP ON TO THE BOX AND GIVE THE SIGNAL FOR STARTING IN SO DOING HE OBEYED A MAXIM WHICH HE HAD
6081-41997-0002 A MAXIM INTENDED TO ASSURE HIS AFTER FAME AND WHICH RAN AS FOLLOWS ALWAYS SUSPECT THAT WHICH SEEMS PROBABLE AND BEGIN BY BELIEVING WHAT APPEARS INCREDIBLE
6081-41997-0003 AS SOON AS THE VEHICLE WAS WELL UNDER WAY THE YOUNG DETECTIVE PROCEEDED TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF INTO THE DRIVER'S GOOD GRACES BEING ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN ALL THE INFORMATION THAT THIS WORTHY WAS ABLE TO IMPART
6081-41997-0004 IN A TONE THAT IMPLIED THAT ALL TRIFLING WOULD BE USELESS THE CABMAN CRIED HEY UP HEY UP COCOTTE AND HIS MARE PRICKED UP HER EARS AND QUICKENED HER PACE SO THAT THE RUE DE CHOISY
6081-41997-0005 WAS SPEEDILY REACHED THEN IT WAS THAT LECOQ RESUMED HIS INQUIRIES WELL MY GOOD FELLOW HE BEGAN YOU HAVE TOLD ME THE PRINCIPAL FACTS NOW I SHOULD LIKE THE DETAILS
6081-41997-0006 HOW DID THESE TWO WOMEN ATTRACT YOUR ATTENTION
6081-41997-0007 I HAD BEEN HAVING A MOST UNFORTUNATE DAY SIX HOURS ON A STAND ON THE BOULEVARDS WITH THE RAIN POURING ALL THE TIME IT WAS SIMPLY AWFUL AT MIDNIGHT I HAD NOT MADE MORE THAN A FRANC AND A
6081-41997-0008 HALF FOR MYSELF BUT I WAS SO WET AND MISERABLE AND THE HORSE SEEMED SO DONE UP THAT I DECIDED TO GO HOME I DID GRUMBLE I CAN TELL YOU WELL I HAD JUST PASSED THE CORNER OF THE RUE PICARD
6081-41997-0009 WHEN I SAW TWO WOMEN STANDING UNDER A LAMP SOME LITTLE DISTANCE OFF I DID NOT PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THEM FOR WHEN A MAN IS AS OLD AS I AM WOMEN GO ON SAID LECOQ WHO COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIS IMPATIENCE
6081-41997-0010 I HAD ALREADY PASSED THEM WHEN THEY BEGAN TO CALL AFTER ME I PRETENDED I DID NOT HEAR THEM BUT ONE OF THEM RAN AFTER THE CAB CRYING
6081-41997-0011 A LOUIS FOR YOURSELF I HESITATED FOR A MOMENT WHEN THE WOMAN ADDED AND TEN FRANCS FOR THE FARE I THEN DREW UP LECOQ WAS BOILING OVER WITH IMPATIENCE BUT HE FELT THAT THE WISEST COURSE WAS NOT TO INTERRUPT THE DRIVER WITH QUESTIONS
6081-41997-0012 BUT TO LISTEN TO ALL HE HAD TO SAY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE CONTINUED THE COACHMAN I WASN'T INCLINED TO TRUST TWO SUCH SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS ALONE AT THAT HOUR AND IN THAT PART OF THE CITY
6081-41997-0013 SO JUST AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO GET INTO THE CAB I CALLED TO THEM WAIT A BIT MY LITTLE FRIENDS YOU HAVE PROMISED PAPA SOME SOUS WHERE ARE THEY THE ONE WHO HAD CALLED AFTER THE CAB AT ONCE HANDED ME THIRTY FRANCS
6081-41997-0014 SAYING ABOVE ALL MAKE HASTE YOUR RECITAL COULD NOT BE MORE MINUTE EXCLAIMED LECOQ APPROVINGLY NOW HOW ABOUT THESE TWO WOMEN
6081-41997-0015 WHICH RAN AFTER YOU THE GIRL WHO WAS NEATLY DRESSED THE ONE WHO THE DRIVER SUDDENLY PAUSED SOME VIVID REMEMBRANCE PASSED THROUGH HIS BRAIN AND ABRUPTLY JERKING THE RAINS
6081-41997-0016 I DID NOTICE SOMETHING STRANGE ONE OF THE TWO WOMEN CALLED THE OTHER MADAME AS LARGE AS LIFE WHILE THE OTHER SAID THEE AND THOU AND SPOKE AS IF SHE WERE SOMEBODY
6081-41997-0017 AND WHICH WAS IT THAT SAID THEE AND THOU
6081-41997-0018 SHE WITH SHABBY DRESS AND SHOES AS BIG AS A GOUTY MAN'S YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HER SHAKE THE PRIM LOOKING GIRL AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A PLUM TREE YOU LITTLE FOOL SAID SHE DO YOU WANT TO RUIN US
6081-41997-0019 YOU WILL HAVE TIME TO FAINT WHEN WE GET HOME NOW COME ALONG AND THEN SHE BEGAN TO SOB INDEED MADAME INDEED I CAN'T SHE SAID AND REALLY SHE SEEMED QUITE UNABLE TO MOVE IN FACT
6081-41997-0020 SHE APPEARED TO BE SO ILL THAT I SAID TO MYSELF HERE IS A YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAS DRUNK MORE THAN IS GOOD FOR HER THESE FACTS CONFIRMED EVEN IF THEY CORRECTED
6081-41997-0021 LECOQ'S FIRST SUPPOSITIONS AS HE HAD SUSPECTED THE SOCIAL POSITION OF THE TWO WOMEN WAS NOT THE SAME HE HAD BEEN MISTAKEN HOWEVER
6081-41997-0022 IN ATTRIBUTING THE HIGHER STANDING TO THE WOMAN WEARING THE SHOES WITH THE HIGH HEELS THE MARKS OF WHICH HE HAD SO PARTICULARLY NOTICED IN THE SNOW WITH ALL THE ATTENDANT SIGNS OF PRECIPITATION TERROR AND WEAKNESS
6081-41997-0023 IN REALITY SOCIAL PREEMINENCE BELONGED TO THE WOMAN WHO HAD LEFT THE LARGE BROAD FOOTPRINTS BEHIND HER AND NOT MERELY WAS SHE OF A SUPERIOR RANK BUT SHE HAD ALSO SHOWN SUPERIOR ENERGY
6081-41997-0024 CONTRARY TO LECOQ'S ORIGINAL IDEA IT NOW SEEMED EVIDENT THAT SHE WAS THE MISTRESS AND HER COMPANION THE SERVANT IS THAT ALL MY GOOD FELLOW HE ASKED THE DRIVER
6081-41997-0025 HAD A HAND AS SMALL AS A CHILD'S AND IN SPITE OF HER ANGER HER VOICE WAS AS SWEET AS MUSIC DID YOU SEE HER FACE I JUST CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF IT
6081-41997-0026 WHETHER SHE WAS A BLONDE OR BRUNETTE SO MANY QUESTIONS AT A TIME CONFUSED THE DRIVER STOP A MINUTE HE REPLIED IN MY OPINION SHE WASN'T PRETTY AND I DON'T BELIEVE SHE WAS YOUNG
6081-41997-0027 BUT SHE CERTAINLY WAS A BLONDE AND WITH PLENTY OF HAIR TOO WAS SHE TALL OR SHORT STOUT OR SLENDER BETWEEN THE TWO THIS WAS VERY VAGUE AND THE OTHER
6081-41997-0028 ASKED LECOQ THE NEATLY DRESSED ONE THE DEUCE AS FOR HER I DID NOT NOTICE HER AT ALL ALL I KNOW ABOUT HER IS THAT SHE WAS VERY SMALL WOULD YOU RECOGNIZE HER IF YOU MET HER AGAIN GOOD HEAVENS NO
6081-41997-0029 THE VEHICLE WAS NOW ROLLING ALONG THE RUE DE BOURGOGNE HALF WAY DOWN THE STREET THE DRIVER PULLED UP AND TURNING TO LECOQ EXCLAIMED HERE WE ARE THAT'S THE HOUSE THE HUSSIES WENT INTO
6081-41997-0030 TO DRAW OFF THE SILK HANDKERCHIEF THAT SERVED HIM AS A MUFFLER TO FOLD IT AND SLIP IT INTO HIS POCKET TO SPRING TO THE GROUND AND ENTER THE HOUSE INDICATED WAS ONLY THE WORK OF AN INSTANT FOR THE YOUNG DETECTIVE
6081-41997-0031 IN THE CONCIERGE'S LITTLE ROOM HE FOUND AN OLD WOMAN KNITTING LECOQ BOWED TO HER POLITELY AND DISPLAYING THE SILK HANDKERCHIEF EXCLAIMED MADAME I HAVE COME TO RETURN THIS ARTICLE TO ONE OF YOUR LODGERS
6081-41997-0032 TO WHICH ONE REALLY I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW IN A MOMENT THE WORTHY DAME IMAGINED THAT THIS POLITE YOUNG MAN WAS MAKING FUN OF HER YOU SCAMP SHE BEGAN
6081-41997-0033 EXCUSE ME INTERRUPTED LECOQ ALLOW ME TO FINISH I MUST TELL YOU THAT AT ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING OF THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY I WAS QUIETLY RETURNING HOME WHEN TWO LADIES WHO WERE SEEMINGLY IN A GREAT HURRY
6081-41997-0034 OVERTOOK ME AND PASSED ON ONE OF THEM DROPPED THIS HANDKERCHIEF WHICH I PICKED UP I HASTENED AFTER HER TO RESTORE IT BUT BEFORE I COULD OVERTAKE THEM THEY HAD RUNG THE BELL AT YOUR DOOR AND WERE ALREADY IN THE HOUSE
6081-41997-0035 FOR FEAR OF DISTURBING YOU YESTERDAY I WAS SO BUSY I COULDN'T COME HOWEVER HERE I AM AT LAST AND HERE'S THE HANDKERCHIEF SO SAYING
6081-41997-0036 I SLIPPED ON MY DRESS AND WENT OUT INTO THE HALL WHERE I SAW TWO WOMEN HASTENING TOWARD THE DOOR BEFORE I COULD REACH THEM THEY SLAMMED THE DOOR IN MY FACE I OPENED IT AGAIN AS QUICKLY AS I COULD AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE STREET
6081-41997-0037 BUT THEY WERE HURRYING AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD IN WHAT DIRECTION OH THEY WERE RUNNING TOWARD THE RUE DE VARENNES
6081-41997-0038 HOWEVER HE BOWED CIVILLY TO THE CONCIERGE WHOM HE MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE NEED OF AT ANOTHER TIME AND THEN WENT BACK TO THE CAB AS I HAD SUPPOSED THEY DO NOT LIVE HERE HE REMARKED TO THE DRIVER
6081-41998-0000 WHEN A MYSTERIOUS CRIME HAS BEEN PERPETRATED OR A GREAT CATASTROPHE HAS HAPPENED AND THE IDENTITY OF THE VICTIMS HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED A GREAT DAY INVARIABLY FOLLOWS AT THE MORGUE
6081-41998-0001 THE ATTENDANTS ARE SO ACCUSTOMED TO THE HORRORS OF THE PLACE THAT THE MOST SICKLY SIGHT FAILS TO IMPRESS THEM AND EVEN UNDER THE MOST DISTRESSING CIRCUMSTANCES THEY HASTEN GAILY TO AND FRO
6081-41998-0002 EXCHANGING JESTS WELL CALCULATED TO MAKE AN ORDINARY MORTAL'S FLESH CREEP AS A RULE THEY ARE FAR LESS INTERESTED IN THE CORPSES LAID OUT FOR PUBLIC VIEW ON THE MARBLE SLABS IN THE PRINCIPAL HALL
6081-41998-0003 AS THE VEHICLE CONVEYING LECOQ REACHED THE QUAY
6081-41998-0004 THE NEWSPAPERS HAD REPORTED THE TRAGEDY AT THE WIDOW CHUPIN'S DRINKING DEN OF COURSE MORE OR LESS CORRECTLY AND EVERYBODY WISHED TO SEE THE VICTIMS
6081-41998-0005 I PREFER TO ALIGHT HERE RATHER THAN IN FRONT OF THE MORGUE HE SAID SPRINGING TO THE GROUND THEN PRODUCING FIRST HIS WATCH AND NEXT HIS PURSE HE ADDED
6081-41998-0006 WE HAVE BEEN AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES MY GOOD FELLOW CONSEQUENTLY I OWE YOU NOTHING AT ALL REPLIED THE DRIVER DECIDEDLY BUT NO NOT A SOU
6081-41998-0007 I AM TOO WORRIED ALREADY TO THINK THAT I TOOK THE MONEY THESE HUSSIES OFFERED ME IT WOULD ONLY HAVE SERVED ME RIGHT IF THE LIQUOR I BOUGHT WITH IT HAD GIVEN ME THE GRIPES DON'T BE UNEASY ABOUT THE SCORE AND IF YOU NEED A TRAP USE MINE FOR NOTHING
6081-41998-0008 TILL YOU HAVE CAUGHT THE JADES AS LECOQ'S PURSE WAS LOW HE DID NOT INSIST YOU WILL AT LEAST TAKE MY NAME AND ADDRESS CONTINUED THE DRIVER CERTAINLY
6081-41998-0009 THE MAGISTRATE WILL WANT YOUR EVIDENCE AND A SUMMONS WILL BE SENT YOU ALL RIGHT THEN ADDRESS IT TO PAPILLON EUGENE DRIVER
6081-41998-0010 I LODGE AT HIS PLACE BECAUSE I HAVE SOME SMALL INTEREST IN THE BUSINESS YOU SEE THE YOUNG DETECTIVE WAS HASTENING AWAY WHEN PAPILLON CALLED HIM BACK WHEN YOU LEAVE THE MORGUE YOU WILL WANT TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE HE SAID
6081-41998-0011 YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU HAD ANOTHER APPOINTMENT AND THAT YOU WERE ALREADY LATE YES I OUGHT TO BE AT THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE BUT IT IS ONLY A FEW STEPS FROM HERE NO MATTER
6081-41998-0012 I WILL WAIT FOR YOU AT THE CORNER OF THE BRIDGE IT'S USELESS TO SAY NO I'VE MADE UP MY MIND AND I'M A BRETON YOU KNOW
6081-41998-0013 ACCORDINGLY LECOQ MADE A GESTURE OF ASSENT AND THEN HURRIED TOWARD THE MORGUE IF THERE WAS A CROWD ON THE ROADWAY OUTSIDE IT WAS BECAUSE THE GLOOMY BUILDING ITSELF WAS CRAMMED FULL OF PEOPLE INDEED THE SIGHTSEERS
6081-41998-0014 MOST OF WHOM COULD SEE NOTHING AT ALL WERE PACKED AS CLOSELY AS SARDINES
6081-41998-0015 THAT LECOQ MANAGED TO EFFECT AN ENTRANCE AS USUAL HE FOUND AMONG THE MOB A LARGE NUMBER OF GIRLS AND WOMEN FOR STRANGE TO SAY
6081-41998-0016 TO THE DISGUSTING SIGHTS AND HORRIBLE EMOTIONS THAT REPAY A VISIT TO THE MORGUE THE SHOP AND WORK GIRLS WHO RESIDE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD READILY GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE CORPSES
6081-41998-0017 WHICH CRIME ACCIDENT AND SUICIDE BRING TO THIS HORRIBLE PLACE A FEW
6081-41998-0018 MAY COME NO FURTHER THAN THE DOOR BUT THE OTHERS ENTER AND AFTER A LONG STARE RETURN AND RECOUNT THEIR IMPRESSIONS TO THEIR LESS COURAGEOUS COMPANIONS IF THERE SHOULD BE NO CORPSE EXHIBITED
6081-41998-0019 IF ALL THE MARBLE SLABS ARE UNOCCUPIED STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM THE VISITORS TURN HASTILY AWAY WITH AN EXPRESSION OF DISAPPOINTMENT OR DISCONTENT THERE WAS NO FEAR OF THEIR DOING SO HOWEVER
6081-41998-0020 FOR THE MYSTERIOUS MURDERER WHOSE IDENTITY LECOQ WAS TRYING TO ESTABLISH HAD FURNISHED THREE VICTIMS FOR THEIR DELECTATION
6081-41998-0021 AND YET A DAMP CHILL CAME FROM BEYOND THE IRON RAILINGS WHILE FROM THE CROWD ITSELF ROSE AN INFECTIOUS VAPOR IMPREGNATED WITH THE STENCH OF THE CHLORIDE OF LIME USED AS A DISINFECTANT
6081-41998-0022 AS A CONTINUOUS ACCOMPANIMENT TO THE EXCLAMATIONS SIGHS AND WHISPERED COMMENTS OF THE BYSTANDERS CAME THE MURMUR OF THE WATER TRICKLING FROM A SPIGOT AT THE HEAD OF EACH SLAB A TINY STREAM THAT FLOWED FORTH
6081-41998-0023 ONLY TO FALL IN FINE SPRAY UPON THE MARBLE THROUGH THE SMALL ARCHED WINDOWS A GRAY LIGHT STOLE IN ON THE EXPOSED BODIES BRINGING EACH MUSCLE INTO BOLD RELIEF
6081-41998-0024 REVEALING THE GHASTLY TINTS OF THE LIFELESS FLESH AND IMPARTING A SINISTER ASPECT TO THE TATTERED CLOTHING HUNG AROUND THE ROOM TO AID IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE CORPSES THIS CLOTHING AFTER A CERTAIN TIME IS SOLD
6081-41998-0025 FOR NOTHING IS WASTED AT THE MORGUE HOWEVER LECOQ WAS TOO OCCUPIED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO REMARK THE HORRORS OF THE SCENE HE SCARCELY BESTOWED A GLANCE ON THE THREE VICTIMS
6081-41998-0026 WHOM HE COULD NOT PERCEIVE HAD GEVROL INTENTIONALLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY FAILED TO FULFIL HIS PROMISE
6081-41998-0027 UNABLE TO EXPLAIN THE CAUSE OF HIS COMRADE'S ABSENCE LECOQ ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE HEAD KEEPER IT WOULD SEEM THAT NO ONE HAS RECOGNIZED THE VICTIMS HE REMARKED NO ONE AND YET
6081-41998-0028 EVER SINCE OPENING WE HAVE HAD AN IMMENSE CROWD IF I WERE MASTER HERE ON DAYS LIKE THIS I WOULD CHARGE AN ADMISSION FEE OF TWO SOUS A HEAD
6081-41998-0029 IT WOULD BRING IN A ROUND SUM MORE THAN ENOUGH TO COVER THE EXPENSES THE KEEPER'S REPLY SEEMED TO OFFER AN INDUCEMENT TO CONVERSATION BUT LECOQ DID NOT SEIZE IT
6081-41998-0030 BUT AFTER A MOMENT'S HESITATION HE VENTURED TO INQUIRE ARE YOU ONE OF THEM YES I AM REPLIED LECOQ EXHIBITING HIS CARD IN SUPPORT OF HIS ASSERTION AND YOUR NAME
6081-41998-0031 THE KEEPER'S FACE BRIGHTENED UP IN THAT CASE SAID HE I HAVE A LETTER FOR YOU WRITTEN BY YOUR COMRADE WHO WAS OBLIGED TO GO AWAY HERE IT IS THE YOUNG DETECTIVE AT ONCE TORE OPEN THE ENVELOPE AND READ
6081-41998-0032 MONSIEUR LECOQ MONSIEUR THIS SIMPLE FORMULA OF POLITENESS BROUGHT A FAINT SMILE TO HIS LIPS
6081-41998-0033 WHEN AT ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK THREE YOUNG MEN ENTERED ARM IN ARM FROM THEIR MANNER AND APPEARANCE I JUDGED THEM TO BE CLERKS IN SOME STORE OR WAREHOUSE
6081-41998-0034 SUDDENLY I NOTICED THAT ONE OF THEM TURNED AS WHITE AS HIS SHIRT AND CALLING THE ATTENTION OF HIS COMPANIONS TO ONE OF THE UNKNOWN VICTIMS HE WHISPERED GUSTAVE
6081-41998-0035 HIS COMRADES PUT THEIR HANDS OVER HIS MOUTH AND ONE OF THEM EXCLAIMED WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT YOU FOOL TO MIX YOURSELF UP WITH THIS AFFAIR DO YOU WANT TO GET US INTO TROUBLE THEREUPON THEY WENT OUT AND I FOLLOWED THEM
6081-41998-0036 BUT THE PERSON WHO HAD FIRST SPOKEN WAS SO OVERCOME THAT HE COULD SCARCELY DRAG HIMSELF ALONG AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE OBLIGED TO TAKE HIM TO A LITTLE RESTAURANT CLOSE BY I ENTERED IT MYSELF AND IT IS THERE I WRITE THIS LETTER
6081-41998-0037 IN THE MEAN TIME WATCHING THEM OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE I SEND THIS NOTE EXPLAINING MY ABSENCE TO THE HEAD KEEPER WHO WILL GIVE IT YOU YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT I AM GOING TO FOLLOW THESE MEN A B
6081-41998-0038 S THE HANDWRITING OF THIS LETTER WAS ALMOST ILLEGIBLE AND THERE WERE MISTAKES IN SPELLING IN WELL NIGH EVERY LINE STILL ITS MEANING WAS CLEAR AND EXACT AND COULD NOT FAIL TO EXCITE THE MOST FLATTERING HOPES
6081-41998-0039 AS THE OLD COACHMAN URGED ON HIS HORSE HE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM SAYING THINGS ARE GOING ON TO SUIT YOU A FRIENDLY HUSH WAS THE ONLY RESPONSE
6081-41998-0040 WHO INSISTED UPON REMAINING AT HIS ORDERS HE SUCCEEDED AT LAST HOWEVER BUT EVEN WHEN HE HAD REACHED THE PORTICO ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BUILDING
6081-41998-0041 LECOQ HAD ENTERED THE LEFT WING OF THE PALAIS HE CLIMBED THE STAIRS TILL HE HAD REACHED THE THIRD FLOOR AND WAS ABOUT TO ENTER THE LONG NARROW BADLY LIGHTED CORRIDOR
6081-41998-0042 WHEN FINDING A DOORKEEPER INSTALLED BEHIND A HEAVY OAKEN DESK HE REMARKED
6081-41998-0043 THE MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD NO SAID HE
6081-42010-0000 HE FIRST OF ALL PROCEEDED TO THE PREFECTURE OF POLICE GOING THE LONGEST WAY ROUND AS A MATTER OF COURSE BUT ON REACHING HIS DESTINATION HE COULD FIND NO ONE WHO HAD SEEN THE YOUNG DETECTIVE ACCORDINGLY
6081-42010-0001 AND DEPENDENT ON THE CUSTOMERS IT BROUGHT THEM BEING OF A CONSCIENTIOUS TURN OF MIND HE ENTERED EACH ESTABLISHMENT IN SUCCESSION AND MEETING NOW AND AGAIN VARIOUS ACQUAINTANCES HE FELT COMPELLED TO PROFFER AND ACCEPT
6081-42010-0002 NUMEROUS GLASSES OF THE FAVORITE MORNING BEVERAGE WHITE WINE TURN WHICH WAY HE WOULD HOWEVER LOITER AS LONG AS HE MIGHT
6081-42010-0003 HE WAS RETURNING IN HASTE A TRIFLE UNEASY ON ACCOUNT OF THE LENGTH OF HIS ABSENCE WHEN HE PERCEIVED A CAB PULL UP IN FRONT OF THE PALAIS GATEWAY A SECOND GLANCE AND OH GREAT GOOD FORTUNE HE SAW LECOQ
6081-42010-0004 FATHER ABSINTHE AND THE VIRTUOUS TOINON ALIGHT FROM THIS VERY VEHICLE HIS PEACE OF MIND AT ONCE RETURNED AND IT WAS IN A VERY IMPORTANT AND SOMEWHAT HUSKY TONE
6081-42010-0005 THAT HE DELIVERED THE ORDER FOR LECOQ TO FOLLOW HIM WITHOUT A MINUTE'S DELAY
6081-42010-0006 HAS ASKED FOR YOU A NUMBER OF TIMES SAID HE HE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY IMPATIENT AND HE IS IN A VERY BAD HUMOR SO YOU MAY EXPECT TO HAVE YOUR HEAD SNAPPED OFF IN THE MOST EXPEDITIOUS MANNER LECOQ SMILED AS HE WENT UP THE STAIRS
6081-42010-0007 WAS HE NOT BRINGING WITH HIM THE MOST POTENT OF JUSTIFICATIONS HE THOUGHT OF THE AGREEABLE SURPRISE HE HAD IN STORE FOR THE MAGISTRATE AND FANCIED HE COULD PICTURE THE SUDDEN BRIGHTENING OF THAT FUNCTIONARY'S GLOOMY FACE
6081-42010-0008 AND YET FATE SO WILLED IT THAT THE DOORKEEPER'S MESSAGE AND HIS URGENT APPEAL THAT LECOQ SHOULD NOT LOITER ON THE WAY PRODUCED THE MOST UNFORTUNATE RESULTS
6081-42010-0009 WHEN HE SAW HOWEVER THAT THE MAGISTRATE WAS NOT ALONE AND WHEN HE RECOGNIZED POLYTE CHUPIN THE ORIGINAL OF THE PHOTOGRAPH
6081-42010-0010 HE INSTANTLY PERCEIVED HIS MISTAKE AND UNDERSTOOD ITS CONSEQUENCES THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING TO BE DONE HE MUST PREVENT ANY EXCHANGE OF WORDS BETWEEN THE TWO
6081-42010-0011 HE ORDERED HER TO LEAVE THE ROOM AT ONCE BUT THE POOR CREATURE WAS QUITE OVERCOME AND TREMBLED LIKE A LEAF HER EYES WERE FIXED UPON HER UNWORTHY HUSBAND AND THE HAPPINESS SHE FELT AT SEEING HIM AGAIN SHONE PLAINLY IN HER ANXIOUS GAZE
6081-42010-0012 JUST FOR ONE SECOND AND THEN SHE CAUGHT HIS WITHERING GLANCE AND HEARD HIS WORDS OF MENACE TERROR STRICKEN SHE STAGGERED BACK AND THEN LECOQ SEIZED HER AROUND THE WAIST
6081-42010-0013 AND LIFTING HER WITH HIS STRONG ARMS CARRIED HER OUT INTO THE PASSAGE THE WHOLE SCENE HAD BEEN SO BRIEF
6081-42010-0014 WAS STILL FORMING THE ORDER FOR TOINON TO BE REMOVED FROM THE ROOM WHEN HE FOUND THE DOOR CLOSED AGAIN
6081-42010-0015 AH AH THOUGHT THE SMILING CLERK IN A FLUTTER OF DELIGHT THIS IS SOMETHING NEW BUT AS THESE LITTLE DIVERSIONS NEVER MADE HIM FORGET HIS DUTIES HE LEANED TOWARD THE MAGISTRATE AND ASKED
6081-42010-0016 AND WORD FOR WORD IF YOU PLEASE HE PAUSED THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN THIS TIME TO ADMIT THE MAGISTRATE'S MESSENGER WHO TIMIDLY AND WITH A RATHER GUILTY AIR
6081-42010-0017 AT THE SAME TIME CASTING THE BLAME ON HIS OWN IMPATIENCE AND LACK OF CAUTION
6081-42010-0018 YET OBTAINING THE INFORMATION HE DESIRED LET US PROCEED HE SAID TO POLYTE WHO HAD NOT MOVED SINCE HIS WIFE HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THE ROOM
6081-42010-0019 BEING TO ALL APPEARANCES SUBLIMELY INDIFFERENT TO EVERYTHING PASSING AROUND HIM TO THE MAGISTRATE'S PROPOSAL HE CARELESSLY NODDED ASSENT WAS THAT YOUR WIFE WHO CAME IN JUST NOW
6081-42010-0020 WHY DID YOU BEHAVE IN THAT MANNER IT WASN'T THE TIME FOR SENTIMENT YOU ARE NOT TELLING THE TRUTH YOU SIMPLY DESIRED TO ATTRACT HER ATTENTION TO INFLUENCE HER EVIDENCE I
6081-42010-0021 I INFLUENCE HER EVIDENCE I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU BUT FOR THAT SUPPOSITION YOUR WORDS WOULD HAVE BEEN MEANINGLESS WHAT WORDS THE MAGISTRATE TURNED TO HIS CLERK
6081-42010-0022 READ THE LAST REMARK YOU TOOK DOWN IN A MONOTONOUS VOICE THE SMILING CLERK REPEATED I SHOULD LIKE TO KILL THE PERSON WHO DARED TO SAY THAT I KNEW LACHENEUR
6081-42010-0023 WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT IT'S VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND SIR
6081-42010-0024 DON'T PREVARICATE ANY LONGER HE SAID YOU CERTAINLY ORDERED YOUR WIFE NOT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT LACHENEUR THAT'S EVIDENT WHY DID YOU DO SO WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF HER TELLING US
6081-42010-0025 DO YOU SUPPOSE THE POLICE ARE IGNORANT OF YOUR ACQUAINTANCE WITH LACHENEUR OF YOUR CONVERSATION WITH HIM WHEN HE CAME IN A CAB TO THE CORNER OF THE WASTE GROUND NEAR YOUR MOTHER'S WINE SHOP AND OF THE HOPES OF FORTUNE YOU BASED UPON HIS PROMISES
6081-42010-0026 BE GUIDED BY ME CONFESS EVERYTHING WHILE THERE IS YET TIME AND ABANDON THE PRESENT COURSE WHICH MAY LEAD YOU INTO SERIOUS DANGER ONE MAY BE AN ACCOMPLICE IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE
6081-42010-0027 AS THESE WORDS FELL ON POLYTE'S EARS IT WAS EVIDENT HIS IMPUDENCE AND INDIFFERENCE HAD RECEIVED A SEVERE SHOCK HE SEEMED CONFOUNDED AND HUNG HIS HEAD AS IF THOROUGHLY ABASHED STILL HE PRESERVED AN OBSTINATE SILENCE
6081-42010-0028 AND THE MAGISTRATE FINDING THAT THIS LAST THRUST HAD FAILED TO PRODUCE ANY EFFECT GAVE UP THE FIGHT IN DESPAIR HE RANG THE BELL AND ORDERED THE GUARD TO CONDUCT THE WITNESS BACK TO PRISON
6081-42010-0029 AND TO TAKE EVERY PRECAUTION TO PREVENT HIM SEEING HIS WIFE AGAIN WHEN POLYTE HAD DEPARTED LECOQ REENTERED THE ROOM
6081-42010-0030 BUT I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE WAITING FOR ME AND MADE HASTE TO BRING HER HERE I THOUGHT I WAS ACTING FOR THE BEST NEVER MIND THE MISFORTUNE CAN BE REPAIRED NO SIR NO SINCE SHE HAS SEEN HER HUSBAND
6081-42010-0031 IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET HER TO SPEAK SHE LOVES THAT RASCAL INTENSELY AND HE HAS A WONDERFUL INFLUENCE OVER HER YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID HE THREATENED HER WITH DEATH IF SHE BREATHED A WORD ABOUT LACHENEUR
6081-42010-0032 AND SHE IS SO TERRIFIED THAT THERE IS NO HOPE OF MAKING HER SPEAK
6081-42010-0033 AGAIN SET FOOT IN HIS OFFICE THE POOR CREATURE SEEMED NEARLY HEARTBROKEN
6081-42010-0034 POLYTE'S THREAT HAD AROUSED THE MOST SINISTER APPREHENSIONS IN HER MIND NOT UNDERSTANDING HIS CONNECTION WITH THE AFFAIR SHE ASKED HERSELF IF HER TESTIMONY MIGHT NOT PROVE HIS DEATH WARRANT
6081-42010-0035 NO OR I DON'T KNOW AND RETRACTED EVERYTHING SHE HAD PREVIOUSLY STATED TO LECOQ SHE SWORE THAT SHE HAD BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD THAT HER WORDS HAD BEEN MISCONSTRUED
6081-42010-0036 AT LAST SHE BURST INTO WILD DESPAIRING SOBS AND PRESSED HER FRIGHTENED CHILD AGAINST HER BREAST WHAT COULD BE DONE TO OVERCOME THIS FOOLISH OBSTINACY AS BLIND AND UNREASONING AS A BRUTE'S
6081-42010-0037 BUT REMEMBER THAT YOUR STRANGE SILENCE INJURES YOUR HUSBAND FAR MORE THAN ANYTHING YOU COULD SAY SHE LEFT THE ROOM OR RATHER SHE RUSHED WILDLY FROM IT AS THOUGH ONLY TOO EAGER TO ESCAPE
6181-216552-0000 POTHIER SEEMS TO THINK THAT PROPERTY LIKE ROYALTY EXISTS BY DIVINE RIGHT HE TRACES BACK ITS ORIGIN TO GOD HIMSELF
6181-216552-0001 PRINCIPIUM HE BEGINS IN THIS WAY GOD IS THE ABSOLUTE RULER OF THE UNIVERSE AND ALL THAT IT CONTAINS DOMINI
6181-216552-0002 FOR THE HUMAN RACE HE HAS CREATED THE EARTH AND ALL ITS CREATURES AND HAS GIVEN IT A CONTROL OVER THEM SUBORDINATE ONLY TO HIS OWN THOU MADEST HIM TO HAVE DOMINION OVER THE WORKS OF THY HANDS
6181-216552-0003 THOU HAST PUT ALL THINGS UNDER HIS FEET SAYS THE PSALMIST GOD ACCOMPANIED THIS GIFT WITH THESE WORDS ADDRESSED TO OUR FIRST PARENTS AFTER THE CREATION BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY
6181-216552-0004 ARE FATHERS UNNATURAL AND CHILDREN PRODIGAL GOD GAVE THE EARTH TO THE HUMAN RACE WHY THEN HAVE I RECEIVED NONE HE HAS PUT ALL THINGS UNDER MY FEET
6181-216552-0005 AND I HAVE NOT WHERE TO LAY MY HEAD MULTIPLY HE TELLS US THROUGH HIS INTERPRETER POTHIER AH LEARNED POTHIER THAT IS AS EASY TO DO AS TO SAY
6181-216552-0006 BUT YOU MUST GIVE MOSS TO THE BIRD FOR ITS NEST THE HUMAN RACE HAVING MULTIPLIED MEN DIVIDED AMONG THEMSELVES THE EARTH AND MOST OF THE THINGS UPON IT THAT WHICH FELL TO EACH
6181-216552-0007 FROM THAT TIME EXCLUSIVELY BELONGED TO HIM THAT WAS THE ORIGIN OF THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY SAY RATHER THE RIGHT OF POSSESSION MEN LIVED IN A STATE OF COMMUNISM
6181-216552-0008 WHETHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE IT MATTERS LITTLE THEN THERE WAS NO PROPERTY NOT EVEN PRIVATE POSSESSION THE GENESIS AND GROWTH OF POSSESSION GRADUALLY FORCING PEOPLE TO LABOR FOR THEIR SUPPORT
6181-216552-0009 THEY AGREED EITHER FORMALLY OR TACITLY IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHICH THAT THE LABORER SHOULD BE SOLE PROPRIETOR OF THE FRUIT OF HIS LABOR THAT IS THEY SIMPLY DECLARED THE FACT
6181-216552-0010 THAT THEREAFTER NONE COULD LIVE WITHOUT WORKING IT NECESSARILY FOLLOWED THAT TO OBTAIN EQUALITY OF PRODUCTS THERE MUST BE EQUALITY OF LABOR AND THAT TO OBTAIN EQUALITY OF LABOR
6181-216552-0011 THERE MUST BE EQUALITY OF FACILITIES FOR LABOR WHOEVER WITHOUT LABOR GOT POSSESSION BY FORCE OR BY STRATEGY OF ANOTHER'S MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE DESTROYED EQUALITY
6181-216552-0012 WHOEVER VIOLATED IT WAS UNJUST THUS LABOR GIVES BIRTH TO PRIVATE POSSESSION THE RIGHT IN A THING
6181-216552-0013 BUT IN WHAT THING EVIDENTLY IN THE PRODUCT NOT IN THE SOIL SO THE ARABS HAVE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD IT AND SO ACCORDING TO CAESAR AND TACITUS THE GERMANS FORMERLY HELD THE ARABS
6181-216552-0014 WHO ADMIT A MAN'S PROPERTY IN THE FLOCKS WHICH HE HAS RAISED DO NOT REFUSE THE CROP TO HIM WHO PLANTED THE SEED BUT THEY DO NOT SEE WHY ANOTHER HIS EQUAL SHOULD NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO PLANT IN HIS TURN
6181-216552-0015 THE INEQUALITY WHICH RESULTS FROM THE PRETENDED RIGHT OF THE FIRST OCCUPANT SEEMS TO THEM TO BE BASED ON NO PRINCIPLE OF JUSTICE AND WHEN ALL THE LAND FALLS INTO THE HANDS OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF INHABITANTS
6181-216552-0016 THERE RESULTS A MONOPOLY IN THEIR FAVOR AGAINST THE REST OF THE NATION TO WHICH THEY DO NOT WISH TO SUBMIT WELL THEY HAVE SHARED THE LAND
6181-216552-0017 AND THAT THIS METHOD OF DISTRIBUTION FIXED AND DURABLE IS ADVANTAGEOUS TO PRODUCTION BUT HOW COULD THIS DIVISION GIVE TO EACH A TRANSFERABLE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A THING TO WHICH
6181-216552-0018 ALL HAD AN INALIENABLE RIGHT OF POSSESSION
6181-216552-0019 THIS METAMORPHOSIS FROM POSSESSOR TO PROPRIETOR IS LEGALLY IMPOSSIBLE IT IMPLIES IN THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS THE UNION OF POSSESSOIRE AND PETITOIRE
6181-216552-0020 AND THE MUTUAL CONCESSIONS OF THOSE WHO SHARE THE LAND ARE NOTHING LESS THAN TRAFFIC IN NATURAL RIGHTS THE ORIGINAL CULTIVATORS OF THE LAND WHO WERE ALSO THE ORIGINAL MAKERS OF THE LAW WERE NOT AS LEARNED
6181-216552-0021 INTO THE RIGHT OF ABSOLUTE PROPERTY BUT WHY HAVE NOT THOSE WHO IN LATER TIMES HAVE ESTABLISHED THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN JUS IN RE AND JUS AD REM
6181-216552-0022 APPLIED IT TO THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPERTY ITSELF LET ME CALL THE ATTENTION OF THE WRITERS ON JURISPRUDENCE TO THEIR OWN MAXIMS THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY PROVIDED IT CAN HAVE A CAUSE CAN HAVE BUT ONE
6181-216552-0023 DOMINIUM NON POTEST NISI EX UNA CAUSA
6181-216552-0024 I CAN POSSESS BY SEVERAL TITLES I CAN BECOME PROPRIETOR BY ONLY ONE
6181-216552-0025 TO ME AS MY SHARE BUT NONE OF THESE TITLES CONFER UPON ME THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY FOR IF I ATTEMPT TO BASE IT UPON OCCUPANCY SOCIETY CAN REPLY
6181-216552-0026 I AM THE ORIGINAL OCCUPANT IF I APPEAL TO MY LABOR IT WILL SAY IT IS ONLY ON THAT CONDITION THAT YOU POSSESS IF I SPEAK OF AGREEMENTS IT WILL RESPOND
6181-216552-0027 THESE AGREEMENTS ESTABLISH ONLY YOUR RIGHT OF USE SUCH HOWEVER ARE THE ONLY TITLES WHICH PROPRIETORS ADVANCE THEY NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER ANY OTHERS INDEED EVERY RIGHT
6181-216552-0028 IT IS POTHIER WHO SAYS IT SUPPOSES A PRODUCING CAUSE IN THE PERSON WHO ENJOYS IT
6181-216552-0029 IN THIS SON OF EARTH WHO PASSES AWAY LIKE A SHADOW THERE EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO EXTERNAL THINGS ONLY TITLES OF POSSESSION NOT ONE TITLE OF PROPERTY WHY THEN
6181-216552-0030 HAS SOCIETY RECOGNIZED A RIGHT INJURIOUS TO ITSELF WHERE THERE IS NO PRODUCING CAUSE WHY IN ACCORDING POSSESSION HAS IT ALSO CONCEDED PROPERTY WHY HAS THE LAW SANCTIONED THIS ABUSE OF POWER
6181-216552-0031 SOME PHILOSOPHERS PRETEND THAT MAN IN EMPLOYING HIS FORCES UPON A NATURAL OBJECT SAY A FIELD OR A TREE ACQUIRES A RIGHT ONLY TO THE IMPROVEMENTS WHICH HE MAKES
6181-216552-0032 TO THE FORM WHICH HE GIVES TO THE OBJECT NOT TO THE OBJECT ITSELF USELESS DISTINCTION IF THE FORM COULD BE SEPARATED FROM THE OBJECT PERHAPS THERE WOULD BE ROOM FOR QUESTION
6181-216552-0033 BUT AS THIS IS ALMOST ALWAYS IMPOSSIBLE THE APPLICATION OF MAN'S STRENGTH TO THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE VISIBLE WORLD IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY THE PRIMARY ORIGIN OF RICHES
6181-216552-0034 VAIN PRETEXT IF THE FORM CANNOT BE SEPARATED FROM THE OBJECT NOR PROPERTY FROM POSSESSION POSSESSION MUST BE SHARED IN ANY CASE
6181-216552-0035 SOCIETY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO FIX THE CONDITIONS OF PROPERTY LET US SUPPOSE THAT AN APPROPRIATED FARM YIELDS A GROSS INCOME OF TEN THOUSAND FRANCS AND AS VERY SELDOM HAPPENS
6181-216552-0036 THE POSSESSOR OF THIS FARM SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO GUARD HIS REPUTATION AS A GOOD FATHER OF A FAMILY BY PAYING TO SOCIETY TEN THOUSAND FRANCS LESS THE TOTAL COSTS OF CULTIVATION
6181-216552-0037 AND THE THREE THOUSAND FRANCS REQUIRED FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF HIS FAMILY THIS PAYMENT IS NOT RENT IT IS AN INDEMNITY WHAT SORT OF JUSTICE IS IT THEN WHICH MAKES SUCH LAWS AS THIS
6181-216552-0038 WHEREAS SINCE LABOR SO CHANGES THE FORM OF A THING THAT THE FORM AND SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE SEPARATED WITHOUT DESTROYING THE THING ITSELF EITHER SOCIETY MUST BE DISINHERITED
6181-216552-0039 OR THE LABORER MUST LOSE THE FRUIT OF HIS LABOR AND WHEREAS IN EVERY OTHER CASE PROPERTY IN RAW MATERIAL WOULD GIVE A TITLE TO ADDED IMPROVEMENTS MINUS THEIR COST
6181-216552-0040 AND WHEREAS IN THIS INSTANCE PROPERTY IN IMPROVEMENTS OUGHT TO GIVE A TITLE TO THE PRINCIPAL
6181-216552-0041 SHALL NEVER BE ADMITTED AGAINST INDIVIDUALS BUT ONLY AGAINST SOCIETY IN SUCH A WAY DO LEGISLATORS ALWAYS REASON IN REGARD TO PROPERTY
6181-216552-0042 THE LAW IS INTENDED TO PROTECT MEN'S MUTUAL RIGHTS THAT IS THE RIGHTS OF EACH AGAINST EACH AND EACH AGAINST ALL
6181-216552-0043 THE LAW MAKERS ALWAYS DISREGARD THE LATTER AS LONG AS MAN IS OPPOSED TO MAN PROPERTY OFFSETS PROPERTY AND THE TWO FORCES BALANCE EACH OTHER AS SOON AS MAN IS ISOLATED
6181-216552-0044 THAT IS OPPOSED TO THE SOCIETY WHICH HE HIMSELF REPRESENTS JURISPRUDENCE IS AT FAULT THEMIS HAS LOST ONE SCALE OF HER BALANCE LISTEN TO THE PROFESSOR OF RENNES THE LEARNED TOULLIER
6181-216552-0045 POSSESSION AGRICULTURE WAS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE HUMAN RACE AND AGRICULTURE IN ITS TURN FAVORS POPULATION AND NECESSITATES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PERMANENT PROPERTY
6181-216552-0046 FOR WHO WOULD TAKE THE TROUBLE TO PLOUGH AND SOW IF HE WERE NOT CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD REAP TO SATISFY THE HUSBANDMAN IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO GUARANTEE HIM POSSESSION OF HIS CROP ADMIT EVEN THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
6181-216552-0047 PROTECTED IN HIS RIGHT OF OCCUPATION OF LAND AS LONG AS HE REMAINED ITS CULTIVATOR THAT WAS ALL THAT HE HAD A RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT WAS ALL THAT THE ADVANCE OF CIVILIZATION DEMANDED
6181-216552-0048 BUT PROPERTY PROPERTY THE RIGHT OF ESCHEAT OVER LANDS WHICH ONE NEITHER OCCUPIES NOR CULTIVATES
6181-216552-0049 WHO PRETENDED TO HAVE IT AGRICULTURE ALONE WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH PERMANENT PROPERTY POSITIVE LAWS WERE NEEDED AND MAGISTRATES TO EXECUTE THEM IN A WORD
6181-216552-0050 THE CIVIL STATE WAS NEEDED THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE HUMAN RACE HAD RENDERED AGRICULTURE NECESSARY THE NEED OF SECURING TO THE CULTIVATOR THE FRUIT OF HIS LABOR MADE PERMANENT PROPERTY NECESSARY
6181-216552-0051 AND ALSO LAWS FOR ITS PROTECTION SO WE ARE INDEBTED TO PROPERTY FOR THE CREATION OF THE CIVIL STATE
6181-216552-0052 A STATE WHICH AT FIRST WAS DESPOTISM THEN MONARCHY THEN ARISTOCRACY TODAY DEMOCRACY AND ALWAYS TYRANNY WITHOUT THE TIES OF PROPERTY IT NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE
6181-216552-0053 TO SUBORDINATE MEN TO THE WHOLESOME YOKE OF THE LAW AND WITHOUT PERMANENT PROPERTY THE EARTH WOULD HAVE REMAINED A VAST FOREST LET US ADMIT THEN
6181-216552-0054 IT IS THE CIVIL LAW WHICH HOLDS THAT WHEN ONCE ACQUIRED PROPERTY CAN BE LOST ONLY BY THE ACTION OF THE PROPRIETOR AND THAT IT EXISTS EVEN AFTER THE PROPRIETOR HAS RELINQUISHED POSSESSION OF THE THING
6181-216552-0055 AND IT HAS FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF A THIRD PARTY THUS PROPERTY AND POSSESSION WHICH ORIGINALLY WERE CONFOUNDED BECAME THROUGH THE CIVIL LAW TWO DISTINCT AND INDEPENDENT THINGS TWO THINGS WHICH IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE LAW
6181-216552-0056 HAVE NOTHING WHATEVER IN COMMON IN THIS WE SEE WHAT A WONDERFUL CHANGE HAS BEEN EFFECTED IN PROPERTY AND TO WHAT AN EXTENT NATURE HAS BEEN ALTERED BY THE CIVIL LAWS THUS THE LAW IN ESTABLISHING PROPERTY
6181-216552-0057 THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATURAL LAW THE APPLICATION OF A MORAL PRINCIPLE IT HAS LITERALLY CREATED A RIGHT OUTSIDE OF ITS OWN PROVINCE IT HAS REALIZED AN ABSTRACTION A METAPHOR
6181-216552-0058 IT HAS INDORSED MONSTROUS PRETENSIONS IT HAS RECEIVED WITH FAVOR IMPIOUS VOWS AS IF IT WERE ABLE TO FILL UP A BOTTOMLESS PIT
6181-216552-0059 BLIND LAW THE LAW OF THE IGNORANT MAN A LAW WHICH IS NOT A LAW THE VOICE OF DISCORD DECEIT AND BLOOD THIS IT IS WHICH CONTINUALLY REVIVED REINSTATED REJUVENATED
6181-216552-0060 RESTORED RE ENFORCED AS THE PALLADIUM OF SOCIETY HAS TROUBLED THE CONSCIENCES OF THE PEOPLE HAS OBSCURED THE MINDS OF THE MASTERS AND HAS INDUCED ALL THE CATASTROPHES
6181-216552-0061 THIS IT IS WHICH CHRISTIANITY HAS CONDEMNED BUT WHICH ITS IGNORANT MINISTERS DEIFY WHO HAVE AS LITTLE DESIRE TO STUDY NATURE AND MAN AS ABILITY TO READ THEIR SCRIPTURES
6181-216552-0062 BUT INDEED WHAT GUIDE DID THE LAW FOLLOW IN CREATING THE DOMAIN OF PROPERTY WHAT PRINCIPLE DIRECTED IT WHAT WAS ITS STANDARD WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT IT WAS EQUALITY
6181-216552-0063 UNLESS THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION WERE AT THE SAME TIME SECURED TO HIM TO FORTIFY THE WEAK AGAINST THE INVASION OF THE STRONG TO SUPPRESS SPOLIATION AND FRAUD
6181-216552-0064 AND THE CUPIDITY OF THE HUSBANDMAN INCREASE IT WAS THOUGHT BEST TO PUT A BRIDLE ON AMBITION BY SETTING BOUNDARIES WHICH AMBITION WOULD IN VAIN ATTEMPT TO OVERSTEP
6181-216552-0065 A MULTITUDE OF RIGHTS SOME FOUNDED IN NATURE BUT WRONGLY INTERPRETED AND STILL MORE WRONGLY APPLIED INHERITANCE GIFT AND EXCHANGE OTHERS LIKE THE PRIVILEGES OF BIRTH AND POSITION
6181-216552-0066 FOR THE BARBARIANS INSTEAD OF INDULGING IN ANNUAL QUARRELS AND FIGHTS INSTEAD OF CONTINUALLY MOVING THEIR HOUSES FURNITURE AND FAMILIES FROM SPOT TO SPOT THAN TO ASSIGN TO EACH INDIVIDUAL A FIXED AND INALIENABLE ESTATE
6181-216552-0067 IT WAS NOT RIGHT THAT THE SOLDIER ON RETURNING FROM AN EXPEDITION SHOULD FIND HIMSELF DISPOSSESSED ON ACCOUNT OF THE SERVICES WHICH HE HAD JUST RENDERED TO HIS COUNTRY
6181-216552-0068 AND BY THE ACTION OF THE PROPRIETOR IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THE EQUALITY IN THE DIVISION SHOULD BE KEPT UP FROM ONE GENERATION TO ANOTHER WITHOUT A NEW DISTRIBUTION OF THE LAND UPON THE DEATH OF EACH FAMILY
6181-216552-0069 THE FEUDAL AND PATRIARCHAL CUSTOM OF RECOGNIZING ONLY ONE HEIR THEN BY A QUITE CONTRARY APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY THE ADMISSION OF ALL THE CHILDREN TO A SHARE IN THEIR FATHER'S ESTATE
6181-216552-0070 WHO NEVER HAD THE FAINTEST IDEA OF STATISTICS VALUATION OR POLITICAL ECONOMY FURNISH US WITH PRINCIPLES OF LEGISLATION THE LAW SAYS A MODERN WRITER ON JURISPRUDENCE
6181-216552-0071 BY WHICH SOCIAL WANTS MUST BE SATISFIED THE PEOPLE DO NOT VOTE IT THE LEGISLATOR DOES NOT EXPRESS IT THE SAVANT DISCOVERS AND FORMULATES IT BUT IN FACT THE LAW
6181-216552-0072 WAS IN THE BEGINNING ONLY THE EXPRESSION OF A WANT AND THE INDICATION OF THE MEANS OF SUPPLYING IT AND UP TO THIS TIME IT HAS BEEN NOTHING ELSE THE LEGISTS WITH MECHANICAL FIDELITY
6181-216552-0073 FULL OF OBSTINACY ENEMIES OF PHILOSOPHY BURIED IN LITERALITIES
6181-216552-0074 TO BE SURE WERE WELL MEANING BUT WANTING IN FORESIGHT THEY DID NOT FORESEE THESE OLD FOUNDERS OF THE DOMAIN OF PROPERTY THAT THE PERPETUAL AND ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO RETAIN ONE'S ESTATE A RIGHT WHICH SEEMED TO THEM
6181-216552-0075 EQUITABLE BECAUSE IT WAS COMMON INVOLVES THE RIGHT TO TRANSFER SELL GIVE GAIN AND LOSE IT THAT IT TENDS CONSEQUENTLY TO NOTHING LESS THAN THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT EQUALITY
6181-216552-0076 THEY DISREGARDED IT THE PRESENT WANT OCCUPIED THEIR WHOLE ATTENTION AND AS ORDINARILY HAPPENS IN SUCH CASES THE DISADVANTAGES WERE AT FIRST SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE AND THEY PASSED UNNOTICED
6181-216552-0077 THEY DID NOT FORESEE THESE INGENUOUS LEGISLATORS THAT IF PROPERTY IS RETAINABLE BY INTENT ALONE NUDO ANIMO
6181-216552-0078 IT CARRIES WITH IT THE RIGHT TO LET TO LEASE TO LOAN AT INTEREST TO PROFIT BY EXCHANGE TO SETTLE ANNUITIES AND TO LEVY A TAX ON A FIELD WHICH INTENT RESERVES
6181-216552-0079 WHILE THE BODY IS BUSY ELSEWHERE THEY DID NOT FORESEE THESE FATHERS OF OUR JURISPRUDENCE THAT IF THE RIGHT OF INHERITANCE IS ANY THING OTHER THAN NATURE'S METHOD OF PRESERVING EQUALITY OF WEALTH
6181-216552-0080 FAMILIES WILL SOON BECOME VICTIMS OF THE MOST DISASTROUS EXCLUSIONS AND SOCIETY
6181-216552-0081 WILL COME TO ITS DEATH THROUGH OPULENCE
6181-216552-0082 THAT IS THAT INHERITANCE AND SUCCESSION WILL LAST FOR EVER WHOEVER MAY BE THE RECOGNIZED HEIR BUT THE SAINT SIMONIANS WISH THE HEIR TO BE DESIGNATED BY THE MAGISTRATE
6181-216552-0083 OTHERS WISH HIM TO BE CHOSEN BY THE DECEASED OR ASSUMED BY THE LAW TO BE SO CHOSEN
6181-216552-0084 TO DAY THE REAL CONTROLLER OF INHERITANCE IS CHANCE OR CAPRICE NOW IN MATTERS OF LEGISLATION CHANCE AND CAPRICE CANNOT BE ACCEPTED AS GUIDES
6181-216552-0085 IT IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING THE MANIFOLD DISTURBANCES WHICH FOLLOW IN THE WAKE OF CHANCE THAT NATURE AFTER HAVING CREATED US EQUAL SUGGESTS TO US THE PRINCIPLE OF HEREDITY
6181-216552-0086 WHICH SERVES AS A VOICE BY WHICH SOCIETY ASKS US TO CHOOSE FROM AMONG ALL OUR BROTHERS HIM WHOM WE JUDGE BEST FITTED TO COMPLETE OUR UNFINISHED WORK THEY DID NOT FORESEE
6181-216552-0087 BUT WHY NEED I GO FARTHER THE CONSEQUENCES ARE PLAIN ENOUGH AND THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO CRITICISE THE WHOLE CODE THE HISTORY OF PROPERTY AMONG THE ANCIENT NATIONS IS THEN
6181-216552-0088 SIMPLY A MATTER OF RESEARCH AND CURIOSITY IT IS A RULE OF JURISPRUDENCE THAT THE FACT DOES NOT SUBSTANTIATE THE RIGHT NOW PROPERTY IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE
6181-216552-0089 THEN THE UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY DOES NOT LEGITIMATE THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY MAN IS MISTAKEN AS TO THE CONSTITUTION OF SOCIETY THE NATURE OF RIGHT
6181-216552-0090 OF WHAT CONSEQUENCE IS IT TO US THAT THE INDIAN RACE WAS DIVIDED INTO FOUR CLASSES THAT ON THE BANKS OF THE NILE AND THE GANGES BLOOD AND POSITION FORMERLY DETERMINED
6181-216552-0091 THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE LAND THAT THE GREEKS AND ROMANS PLACED PROPERTY UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE GODS THAT THEY ACCOMPANIED WITH RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES THE WORK OF PARTITIONING THE LAND AND APPRAISING THEIR GOODS
6181-216552-0092 THE VARIETY OF THE FORMS OF PRIVILEGE DOES NOT SANCTION INJUSTICE THE FAITH OF JUPITER
6181-216552-0093 THAN DO THE MYSTERIES OF VENUS THE WANTON AGAINST CONJUGAL CHASTITY THE AUTHORITY OF THE HUMAN RACE IS OF NO EFFECT AS EVIDENCE IN FAVOR OF THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY BECAUSE THIS RIGHT
6181-216552-0094 RESTING OF NECESSITY UPON EQUALITY CONTRADICTS ITS PRINCIPLE THE DECISION OF THE RELIGIONS WHICH HAVE SANCTIONED IT IS OF NO EFFECT BECAUSE IN ALL AGES THE PRIEST HAS SUBMITTED TO THE PRINCE
6181-216552-0095 THE SOCIAL ADVANTAGES ATTRIBUTED TO PROPERTY CANNOT BE CITED IN ITS BEHALF BECAUSE THEY ALL SPRING FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY OF POSSESSION WHAT MEANS THEN THIS DITHYRAMB UPON PROPERTY
6181-216552-0096 THE SHELTER OF HIS FAMILY IN A WORD THE CORNER STONE OF THE DOMESTIC DWELLING OF COMMUNITIES AND OF THE POLITICAL STATE POSSESSION ALONE PRODUCED ALL THAT
6181-216552-0097 ETERNAL PRINCIPLE PROPERTY IS ETERNAL LIKE EVERY NEGATION OF ALL SOCIAL AND CIVIL INSTITUTIONS FOR THAT REASON
6181-216552-0098 EVERY INSTITUTION AND EVERY LAW BASED ON PROPERTY WILL PERISH IT IS A BOON AS PRECIOUS AS LIBERTY FOR THE RICH PROPRIETOR IN FACT THE CAUSE OF THE CULTIVATION
6181-216552-0099 OF THE HABITABLE EARTH IF THE CULTIVATOR CEASED TO BE A TENANT WOULD THE LAND BE WORSE CARED FOR THE GUARANTEE AND THE MORALITY OF LABOR UNDER THE REGIME OF PROPERTY
6181-216552-0100 LABOR IS NOT A CONDITION BUT A PRIVILEGE THE APPLICATION OF JUSTICE WHAT IS JUSTICE WITHOUT EQUALITY OF FORTUNES A BALANCE WITH FALSE WEIGHTS
6181-216552-0101 ALL MORALITY A FAMISHED STOMACH KNOWS NO MORALITY ALL PUBLIC ORDER CERTAINLY THE PRESERVATION OF PROPERTY
6181-216552-0102 STUMBLING BLOCK OF ALL WHICH OUGHT TO BE SUCH IS PROPERTY TO SUM UP AND CONCLUDE NOT ONLY DOES OCCUPATION LEAD TO EQUALITY IT PREVENTS PROPERTY
6181-216552-0103 FOR SINCE EVERY MAN FROM THE FACT OF HIS EXISTENCE HAS THE RIGHT OF OCCUPATION AND IN ORDER TO LIVE MUST HAVE MATERIAL FOR CULTIVATION ON WHICH HE MAY LABOR AND SINCE
6181-216552-0104 ON THE OTHER HAND THE NUMBER OF OCCUPANTS VARIES CONTINUALLY WITH THE BIRTHS AND DEATHS IT FOLLOWS THAT THE QUANTITY
6181-216552-0105 OF MATERIAL WHICH EACH LABORER MAY CLAIM VARIES WITH THE NUMBER OF OCCUPANTS CONSEQUENTLY THAT OCCUPATION IS ALWAYS SUBORDINATE TO POPULATION FINALLY THAT INASMUCH AS POSSESSION
6181-216552-0106 IN RIGHT CAN NEVER REMAIN FIXED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE IN FACT THAT IT CAN EVER BECOME PROPERTY EVERY OCCUPANT IS THEN NECESSARILY A POSSESSOR
6181-216552-0107 HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE THING ENTRUSTED TO HIM HE MUST USE IT IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERAL UTILITY WITH A VIEW TO ITS PRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT HE HAS NO POWER TO TRANSFORM IT
6181-216552-0108 TO DIMINISH IT OR TO CHANGE ITS NATURE HE CANNOT SO DIVIDE THE USUFRUCT THAT ANOTHER SHALL PERFORM THE LABOR WHILE HE RECEIVES THE PRODUCT IN A WORD
6181-216552-0109 AN IMMORALITY BORN OF VIOLENCE THE MOST MONSTROUS PRETENSION THAT THE CIVIL LAWS EVER SANCTIONED MAN RECEIVES HIS USUFRUCT FROM THE HANDS OF SOCIETY
6181-216552-0110 WHICH ALONE IS THE PERMANENT POSSESSOR THE INDIVIDUAL PASSES AWAY SOCIETY IS DEATHLESS WHAT A PROFOUND DISGUST FILLS MY SOUL WHILE DISCUSSING SUCH SIMPLE TRUTHS
6181-216552-0111 THE AMOUNT OCCUPIED BEING MEASURED NOT BY THE WILL BUT BY THE VARIABLE CONDITIONS OF SPACE AND NUMBER PROPERTY CANNOT EXIST
6181-216552-0112 THIS NO CODE HAS EVER EXPRESSED THIS NO CONSTITUTION CAN ADMIT THESE ARE AXIOMS WHICH THE CIVIL LAW AND THE LAW OF NATIONS DENY
6181-216552-0113 BUT I HEAR THE EXCLAMATIONS OF THE PARTISANS OF ANOTHER SYSTEM LABOR LABOR THAT IS THE BASIS OF PROPERTY READER DO NOT BE DECEIVED
6209-34599-0000 A BURDEN MAKES A ROUGH ROAD ROUGHER IT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN FOUR HOURS SINCE THE HOOKER HAD SAILED FROM THE CREEK OF PORTLAND LEAVING THE BOY ON THE SHORE
6209-34599-0001 DURING THE LONG HOURS SINCE HE HAD BEEN DESERTED AND HAD BEEN JOURNEYING ONWARDS HE HAD MET BUT THREE PERSONS OF THAT HUMAN SOCIETY INTO WHICH HE WAS PERCHANCE ABOUT TO ENTER A MAN THE MAN ON THE HILL
6209-34599-0002 A WOMAN THE WOMAN IN THE SNOW AND THE LITTLE GIRL WHOM HE WAS CARRYING IN HIS ARMS HE WAS EXHAUSTED BY FATIGUE AND HUNGER YET ADVANCED MORE RESOLUTELY THAN EVER WITH LESS STRENGTH AND AN ADDED BURDEN
6209-34599-0003 THAT WHICH HE LOST WAS NOT THROWN AWAY BUT WAS GAINED BY HER HE FOUND OUT THAT THE POOR INFANT ENJOYED THE COMFORT WHICH WAS TO HER THE RENEWAL OF LIFE HE CONTINUED TO ADVANCE
6209-34599-0004 FROM TIME TO TIME STILL HOLDING HER SECURELY HE BENT DOWN AND TAKING A HANDFUL OF SNOW HE RUBBED HIS FEET WITH IT TO PREVENT THEIR BEING FROST BITTEN
6209-34599-0005 HE PUT A LITTLE SNOW IN HIS MOUTH AND SUCKED IT THIS FOR A MOMENT ASSUAGED HIS THIRST BUT CHANGED IT INTO FEVER A RELIEF WHICH WAS AN AGGRAVATION THE STORM HAD BECOME SHAPELESS FROM ITS VIOLENCE
6209-34599-0006 DELUGES OF SNOW ARE POSSIBLE THIS WAS ONE
6209-34599-0007 THIS WAS PERHAPS THE MOMENT WHEN THE DISTRACTED HOOKER WAS GOING TO PIECES IN THE BATTLE OF THE BREAKERS HE TRAVELLED UNDER THIS NORTH WIND STILL TOWARDS THE EAST OVER WIDE SURFACES OF SNOW HE KNEW NOT HOW THE HOURS HAD PASSED
6209-34599-0008 FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD CEASED TO SEE THE SMOKE SUCH INDICATIONS ARE SOON EFFACED IN THE NIGHT BESIDES IT WAS PAST THE HOUR WHEN FIRES ARE PUT OUT OR HE HAD PERHAPS MADE A MISTAKE
6209-34599-0009 DOUBTING HE YET PERSEVERED TWO OR THREE TIMES THE LITTLE INFANT CRIED THEN HE ADOPTED IN HIS GAIT A ROCKING MOVEMENT AND THE CHILD WAS SOOTHED AND SILENCED
6209-34599-0010 SHE ENDED BY FALLING INTO A SOUND SLEEP SHIVERING HIMSELF HE FELT HER WARM
6209-34599-0011 SO THAT THE FROST SHOULD NOT GET IN THROUGH ANY OPENING AND THAT NO MELTED SNOW SHOULD DROP BETWEEN THE GARMENT AND THE CHILD THE PLAIN WAS UNEQUAL IN THE DECLIVITIES INTO WHICH IT SLOPED THE SNOW
6209-34599-0012 DRIVEN BY THE WIND INTO THE DIPS OF THE GROUND WAS SO DEEP IN COMPARISON WITH A CHILD SO SMALL THAT IT ALMOST ENGULFED HIM AND HE HAD TO STRUGGLE THROUGH IT HALF BURIED HE WALKED ON WORKING AWAY THE SNOW WITH HIS KNEES
6209-34599-0013 PLAYING ON HIS FACE WARMED IT FOR A MOMENT THEN LINGERED AND FROZE IN HIS HAIR STIFFENING IT INTO ICICLES HE FELT THE APPROACH OF ANOTHER DANGER HE COULD NOT AFFORD TO FALL
6209-34599-0014 HE KNEW THAT IF HE DID SO HE SHOULD NEVER RISE AGAIN HE WAS OVERCOME BY FATIGUE AND THE WEIGHT OF THE DARKNESS WOULD AS WITH THE DEAD WOMAN HAVE HELD HIM TO THE GROUND AND THE ICE GLUED HIM ALIVE TO THE EARTH
6209-34599-0015 HE HAD TRIPPED UPON THE SLOPES OF PRECIPICES AND HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF
6209-34599-0016 THENCEFORWARD THE SLIGHTEST FALL WOULD BE DEATH A FALSE STEP OPENED FOR HIM A TOMB HE MUST NOT SLIP HE HAD NOT STRENGTH TO RISE EVEN TO HIS KNEES NOW EVERYTHING WAS SLIPPERY
6209-34599-0017 EVERYWHERE THERE WAS RIME AND FROZEN SNOW THE LITTLE CREATURE WHOM HE CARRIED MADE HIS PROGRESS FEARFULLY DIFFICULT SHE WAS NOT ONLY A BURDEN WHICH HIS WEARINESS AND EXHAUSTION MADE EXCESSIVE BUT WAS ALSO AN EMBARRASSMENT
6209-34599-0018 SHE OCCUPIED BOTH HIS ARMS AND TO HIM WHO WALKS OVER ICE BOTH ARMS ARE A NATURAL AND NECESSARY BALANCING POWER HE WAS OBLIGED TO DO WITHOUT THIS BALANCE HE DID WITHOUT IT AND ADVANCED
6209-34599-0019 BENDING UNDER HIS BURDEN NOT KNOWING WHAT WOULD BECOME OF HIM THIS LITTLE INFANT WAS THE DROP CAUSING THE CUP OF DISTRESS TO OVERFLOW HE ADVANCED REELING AT EVERY STEP AS IF ON A SPRING BOARD
6209-34599-0020 AND ACCOMPLISHING WITHOUT SPECTATORS MIRACLES OF EQUILIBRIUM LET US REPEAT THAT HE WAS PERHAPS FOLLOWED ON THIS PATH OF PAIN BY EYES UNSLEEPING IN THE DISTANCES OF THE SHADOWS THE EYES OF THE MOTHER AND THE EYES OF GOD
6209-34599-0021 HE STAGGERED SLIPPED RECOVERED HIMSELF TOOK CARE OF THE INFANT AND GATHERING THE JACKET ABOUT HER HE COVERED UP HER HEAD STAGGERED AGAIN ADVANCED SLIPPED THEN DREW HIMSELF UP THE COWARDLY WIND DROVE AGAINST HIM
6209-34599-0022 APPARENTLY HE MADE MUCH MORE WAY THAN WAS NECESSARY HE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCE ON THE PLAINS WHERE BINCLEAVES FARM WAS AFTERWARDS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN WHAT ARE NOW CALLED SPRING GARDENS AND THE PARSONAGE HOUSE
6209-34599-0023 HOMESTEADS AND COTTAGES OCCUPY THE PLACE OF WASTE LANDS SOMETIMES LESS THAN A CENTURY SEPARATES A STEPPE FROM A CITY SUDDENLY A LULL HAVING OCCURRED IN THE ICY BLAST WHICH WAS BLINDING HIM
6209-34599-0024 HE PERCEIVED AT A SHORT DISTANCE IN FRONT OF HIM A CLUSTER OF GABLES AND OF CHIMNEYS SHOWN IN RELIEF BY THE SNOW THE REVERSE OF A SILHOUETTE A CITY PAINTED IN WHITE ON A BLACK HORIZON
6209-34599-0025 SOMETHING LIKE WHAT WE CALL NOWADAYS A NEGATIVE PROOF ROOFS DWELLINGS SHELTER HE HAD ARRIVED SOMEWHERE AT LAST HE FELT THE INEFFABLE ENCOURAGEMENT OF HOPE
6209-34599-0026 THE WATCH OF A SHIP WHICH HAS WANDERED FROM HER COURSE FEELS SOME SUCH EMOTION WHEN HE CRIES LAND HO HE HURRIED HIS STEPS AT LENGTH THEN HE WAS NEAR MANKIND
6209-34599-0027 THERE GLOWED WITHIN HIM THAT SUDDEN WARMTH SECURITY THAT OUT OF WHICH HE WAS EMERGING WAS OVER THENCEFORWARD THERE WOULD NO LONGER BE NIGHT NOR WINTER NOR TEMPEST
6209-34599-0028 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD LEFT ALL EVIL CHANCES BEHIND HIM
6209-34599-0029 HE ALMOST RAN HIS EYES WERE FIXED ON THE ROOFS THERE WAS LIFE THERE HE NEVER TOOK HIS EYES OFF THEM A DEAD MAN MIGHT GAZE THUS ON WHAT MIGHT APPEAR THROUGH THE HALF OPENED LID OF HIS SEPULCHRE
6209-34599-0030 THERE WERE THE CHIMNEYS OF WHICH HE HAD SEEN THE SMOKE NO SMOKE AROSE FROM THEM NOW HE WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE REACHED THE HOUSES HE CAME TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF A TOWN AN OPEN STREET
6209-34599-0031 AT THAT PERIOD BARS TO STREETS WERE FALLING INTO DISUSE THE STREET BEGAN BY TWO HOUSES IN THOSE TWO HOUSES NEITHER CANDLE NOR LAMP WAS TO BE SEEN NOR IN THE WHOLE STREET NOR IN THE WHOLE TOWN
6209-34599-0032 SO FAR AS EYE COULD REACH THE HOUSE TO THE RIGHT WAS A ROOF RATHER THAN A HOUSE NOTHING COULD BE MORE MEAN THE WALLS WERE OF MUD THE ROOF WAS OF STRAW AND THERE WAS MORE THATCH THAN WALL
6209-34599-0033 A LARGE NETTLE SPRINGING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE WALL REACHED THE ROOF THE HOVEL HAD BUT ONE DOOR WHICH WAS LIKE THAT OF A DOG KENNEL AND A WINDOW WHICH WAS BUT A HOLE ALL WAS SHUT UP AT THE SIDE
6209-34599-0034 AN INHABITED PIG STY TOLD THAT THE HOUSE WAS ALSO INHABITED THE HOUSE ON THE LEFT WAS LARGE HIGH BUILT ENTIRELY OF STONE WITH A SLATED ROOF
6209-34599-0035 OPPOSITE TO THAT OF THE PAUPER THE BOY DID NOT HESITATE HE APPROACHED THE GREAT MANSION THE DOUBLE FOLDING DOOR OF MASSIVE OAK STUDDED WITH LARGE NAILS WAS OF THE KIND THAT LEADS ONE TO EXPECT
6209-34599-0036 NO ANSWER HE STRUCK AGAIN AND TWO KNOCKS NO MOVEMENT WAS HEARD IN THE HOUSE HE KNOCKED A THIRD TIME THERE WAS NO SOUND HE SAW THAT THEY WERE ALL ASLEEP AND DID NOT CARE TO GET UP
6209-34599-0037 BUT LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD NO VOICE WAS HEARD NO STEP MOVED NO CANDLE WAS LIGHTED HE SAW THAT THERE AS WELL THEY DID NOT CARE TO AWAKE
6209-34599-0038 THE HOUSE OF STONE AND THE THATCHED HOVEL WERE EQUALLY DEAF TO THE WRETCHED THE BOY DECIDED ON PUSHING ON FURTHER
6209-34600-0000 ANOTHER FORM OF DESERT IT WAS WEYMOUTH WHICH HE HAD JUST ENTERED WEYMOUTH THEN WAS NOT THE RESPECTABLE AND FINE WEYMOUTH OF TO DAY ANCIENT WEYMOUTH DID NOT PRESENT LIKE THE PRESENT ONE
6209-34600-0001 FOR THE SAME REASON THEY HAD NOT YET DESIGNED ON THE SLOPE OF THE GREEN HILL TOWARDS THE EAST FASHIONED FLAT ON THE SOIL BY CUTTING AWAY THE TURF AND LEAVING THE BARE CHALK TO THE VIEW THE WHITE HORSE AN ACRE LONG
6209-34600-0002 GEORGE THE THIRD HAVING LOST IN HIS OLD AGE THE INTELLECT HE HAD NEVER POSSESSED IN HIS YOUTH WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CALAMITIES OF HIS REIGN HE WAS AN INNOCENT WHY NOT ERECT STATUES TO HIM
6209-34600-0003 EVEN GOOD WOMEN IN THEIR HOUSES A PELL MELL OF SHEDS THROWN FROM HER DEVIL'S BAG WOULD GIVE AN IDEA OF THAT IRREGULAR WEYMOUTH THE GOOD WOMEN IN THE SHEDS INCLUDED THE MUSIC HALL REMAINS AS A SPECIMEN OF THOSE BUILDINGS
6209-34600-0004 A CONFUSION OF WOODEN DENS CARVED AND EATEN BY WORMS WHICH CARVE IN ANOTHER FASHION SHAPELESS OVERHANGING BUILDINGS SOME WITH PILLARS LEANING ONE AGAINST THE OTHER FOR SUPPORT AGAINST THE SEA WIND
6209-34600-0005 AND LEAVING BETWEEN THEM AWKWARD SPACES OF NARROW AND WINDING CHANNELS LANES AND PASSAGES OFTEN FLOODED
6209-34600-0006 THE DESERTED CHILD CARRYING THE FOUNDLING PASSED THROUGH THE FIRST STREET THEN THE SECOND THEN THE THIRD
6209-34600-0007 BUT ALL WERE CLOSED AND DARK AT INTERVALS HE KNOCKED AT THE DOORS NO ONE ANSWERED NOTHING MAKES THE HEART SO LIKE A STONE AS BEING WARM BETWEEN SHEETS THE NOISE AND THE SHAKING HAD AT LENGTH AWAKENED THE INFANT
6209-34600-0008 HE KNEW THIS BECAUSE HE FELT HER SUCK HIS CHEEK SHE DID NOT CRY BELIEVING HIM HER MOTHER HE WAS ABOUT TO TURN AND WANDER LONG PERHAPS IN THE INTERSECTIONS OF THE SCRAMBRIDGE LANES
6209-34600-0009 THEN MORE CULTIVATED PLOTS THAN DWELLINGS MORE THORN HEDGES THAN HOUSES BUT FORTUNATELY HE STRUCK INTO A PASSAGE WHICH EXISTS TO THIS DAY NEAR TRINITY SCHOOLS THIS PASSAGE LED HIM TO A WATER BRINK
6209-34600-0010 WITH MELCOMBE REGIS AND UNDER THE ARCHES OF WHICH THE BACKWATER JOINS THE HARBOUR WEYMOUTH A HAMLET WAS THEN THE SUBURB OF MELCOMBE REGIS A CITY AND PORT NOW MELCOMBE REGIS IS A PARISH OF WEYMOUTH
6209-34600-0011 THE VILLAGE HAS ABSORBED THE CITY IT WAS THE BRIDGE WHICH DID THE WORK BRIDGES ARE STRANGE VEHICLES OF SUCTION WHICH INHALE THE POPULATION AND SOMETIMES SWELL ONE RIVER BANK AT THE EXPENSE OF ITS OPPOSITE NEIGHBOUR
6209-34600-0012 THE BOY WENT TO THE BRIDGE WHICH AT THAT PERIOD WAS A COVERED TIMBER STRUCTURE HE CROSSED IT
6209-34600-0013 THE BRIDGE OPENED ON A RATHER FINE STREET CALLED SAINT THOMAS'S STREET HE ENTERED IT HERE AND THERE WERE HIGH CARVED GABLES AND SHOP FRONTS HE SET TO KNOCKING AT THE DOORS AGAIN
6209-34600-0014 HE HAD NO STRENGTH LEFT TO CALL OR SHOUT AT MELCOMBE REGIS AS AT WEYMOUTH NO ONE WAS STIRRING THE DOORS WERE ALL CAREFULLY DOUBLE LOCKED THE WINDOWS WERE COVERED BY THEIR SHUTTERS AS THE EYES BY THEIR LIDS
6209-34600-0015 ALL ITS LETHARGIES MINGLE THEIR NIGHTMARES ITS SLUMBERS ARE A CROWD AND FROM ITS HUMAN BODIES LYING PRONE THERE ARISES A VAPOUR OF DREAMS SLEEP HAS GLOOMY ASSOCIATES BEYOND THIS LIFE
6209-34600-0016 THE DECOMPOSED THOUGHTS OF THE SLEEPERS FLOAT ABOVE THEM IN A MIST WHICH IS BOTH OF DEATH AND OF LIFE AND COMBINE WITH THE POSSIBLE WHICH HAS ALSO PERHAPS THE POWER OF THOUGHT AS IT FLOATS IN SPACE
6209-34600-0017 HENCE ARISE ENTANGLEMENTS DREAMS THOSE CLOUDS INTERPOSE THEIR FOLDS AND THEIR TRANSPARENCIES OVER THAT STAR THE MIND
6209-34600-0018 INTO IMPALPABILITY MYSTERIOUS DIFFUSED EXISTENCES AMALGAMATE THEMSELVES WITH LIFE ON THAT BORDER OF DEATH WHICH SLEEP IS THOSE LARVAE AND SOULS MINGLE IN THE AIR
6209-34600-0019 EVEN HE WHO SLEEPS NOT FEELS A MEDIUM PRESS UPON HIM FULL OF SINISTER LIFE THE SURROUNDING CHIMERA IN WHICH HE SUSPECTS A REALITY IMPEDES HIM THE WAKING MAN
6209-34600-0020 WENDING HIS WAY AMIDST THE SLEEP PHANTOMS OF OTHERS UNCONSCIOUSLY PUSHES BACK PASSING SHADOWS HAS OR IMAGINES THAT HE HAS A VAGUE FEAR OF ADVERSE CONTACT WITH THE INVISIBLE
6209-34600-0021 AND FEELS AT EVERY MOMENT THE OBSCURE PRESSURE OF A HOSTILE ENCOUNTER WHICH IMMEDIATELY DISSOLVES THERE IS SOMETHING OF THE EFFECT OF A FOREST IN THE NOCTURNAL DIFFUSION OF DREAMS THIS IS WHAT IS CALLED BEING AFRAID WITHOUT REASON
6209-34600-0022 WHAT A MAN FEELS A CHILD FEELS STILL MORE THE UNEASINESS OF NOCTURNAL FEAR INCREASED BY THE SPECTRAL HOUSES INCREASED THE WEIGHT OF THE SAD BURDEN UNDER WHICH HE WAS STRUGGLING
6209-34600-0023 WHICH HE TOOK FOR THE OCEAN HE NO LONGER KNEW IN WHAT DIRECTION THE SEA LAY HE RETRACED HIS STEPS STRUCK TO THE LEFT BY MAIDEN STREET AND RETURNED AS FAR AS SAINT ALBAN'S ROW
6209-34600-0024 THERE BY CHANCE AND WITHOUT SELECTION HE KNOCKED VIOLENTLY AT ANY HOUSE THAT HE HAPPENED TO PASS HIS BLOWS ON WHICH HE WAS EXPENDING HIS LAST ENERGIES WERE JERKY AND WITHOUT AIM NOW CEASING ALTOGETHER FOR A TIME
6209-34600-0025 ONE VOICE ANSWERED THAT OF TIME THREE O'CLOCK TOLLED SLOWLY BEHIND HIM FROM THE OLD BELFRY OF SAINT NICHOLAS THEN ALL SANK INTO SILENCE AGAIN
6209-34600-0026 THEY WERE JUST OVER A SOMEWHAT SEVERE OUTBREAK OF THE PLAGUE IN LONDON AND THAT THE FEAR OF RECEIVING SICK VAGABONDS CAUSED A DIMINUTION OF HOSPITALITY EVERYWHERE PEOPLE WOULD NOT EVEN OPEN THEIR WINDOWS FOR FEAR OF INHALING THE POISON
6209-34600-0027 THE CHILD FELT THE COLDNESS OF MEN MORE TERRIBLY THAN THE COLDNESS OF NIGHT
6209-34600-0028 THE PITILESS DESERT HE HAD UNDERSTOOD THE UNRELENTING TOWN WAS TOO MUCH TO BEAR THE HOUR THE STROKES OF WHICH HE HAD JUST COUNTED HAD BEEN ANOTHER BLOW
6209-34600-0029 NOTHING IS SO FREEZING IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS AS THE VOICE OF THE HOUR IT IS A DECLARATION OF INDIFFERENCE IT IS ETERNITY SAYING WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO ME HE STOPPED
6209-34600-0030 TO LIE DOWN THERE AND DIE HOWEVER THE LITTLE INFANT LEANED HER HEAD AGAINST HIS SHOULDER AND FELL ASLEEP AGAIN THIS BLIND CONFIDENCE SET HIM ONWARDS AGAIN
6209-34600-0031 HE WHOM ALL SUPPORTS WERE FAILING FELT THAT HE WAS HIMSELF A BASIS OF SUPPORT IRRESISTIBLE SUMMONS OF DUTY NEITHER SUCH IDEAS NOR SUCH A SITUATION BELONGED TO HIS AGE
6209-34600-0032 HE DID WHAT HE CHANCED TO DO HE SET OUT AGAIN IN THE DIRECTION OF JOHNSTONE ROW BUT NOW HE NO LONGER WALKED HE DRAGGED HIMSELF ALONG HE LEFT SAINT MARY'S STREET TO THE LEFT MADE ZIGZAGS THROUGH LANES
6209-34600-0033 HE PERCEIVED THE SEA TO THE RIGHT AND SCARCELY ANYTHING MORE OF THE TOWN TO HIS LEFT WHAT WAS TO BECOME OF HIM HERE WAS THE COUNTRY AGAIN TO THE EAST GREAT INCLINED PLANES OF SNOW MARKED OUT THE WIDE SLOPES OF RADIPOLE
6209-34600-0034 SHOULD HE CONTINUE THIS JOURNEY SHOULD HE ADVANCE AND RE ENTER THE SOLITUDES SHOULD HE RETURN AND RE ENTER THE STREETS WHAT WAS HE TO DO BETWEEN THOSE TWO SILENCES THE MUTE PLAIN AND THE DEAF CITY
6209-34600-0035 WHICH OF THE TWO REFUSALS SHOULD HE CHOOSE THERE IS THE ANCHOR OF MERCY THERE IS ALSO THE LOOK OF PITEOUSNESS IT WAS THAT LOOK WHICH THE POOR LITTLE DESPAIRING WANDERER THREW AROUND HIM
6209-34601-0000 MISANTHROPY PLAYS ITS PRANKS A STRANGE AND ALARMING GRINDING OF TEETH REACHED HIM THROUGH THE DARKNESS IT WAS ENOUGH TO DRIVE ONE BACK HE ADVANCED
6209-34601-0001 TO THOSE TO WHOM SILENCE HAS BECOME DREADFUL A HOWL IS COMFORTING THAT FIERCE GROWL REASSURED HIM THAT THREAT WAS A PROMISE THERE WAS THERE A BEING ALIVE AND AWAKE
6209-34601-0002 MADE BY THE REFLECTION OF SNOW AND SEA HE SAW A THING PLACED AS IF FOR SHELTER IT WAS A CART UNLESS IT WAS A HOVEL IT HAD WHEELS IT WAS A CARRIAGE IT HAD A ROOF IT WAS A DWELLING
6209-34601-0003 FROM THE ROOF AROSE A FUNNEL AND OUT OF THE FUNNEL SMOKE THIS SMOKE WAS RED AND SEEMED TO IMPLY A GOOD FIRE IN THE INTERIOR BEHIND PROJECTING HINGES INDICATED A DOOR
6209-34601-0004 AND IN THE CENTRE OF THIS DOOR A SQUARE OPENING SHOWED A LIGHT INSIDE THE CARAVAN HE APPROACHED
6209-34601-0005 AT THE SAME TIME AS THE MOUTH BETWEEN THE WHEELS A HEAD WAS PUT THROUGH THE WINDOW
6209-34601-0006 THE MOUTH WAS SILENT THE HEAD BEGAN AGAIN IS ANY ONE THERE THE CHILD ANSWERED YES WHO I YOU WHO ARE YOU WHENCE DO YOU COME
6209-34601-0007 I AM WEARY SAID THE CHILD WHAT O'CLOCK IS IT I AM COLD WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE I AM HUNGRY THE HEAD REPLIED
6209-34601-0008 THE CHILD BOWED HIS FOREHEAD DREW THE SLEEPING INFANT CLOSER IN HIS ARMS AND COLLECTED HIS STRENGTH TO RESUME HIS JOURNEY HE HAD TAKEN A FEW STEPS AND WAS HURRYING AWAY
6209-34601-0009 THE CHILD TURNED BACK
6209-34601-0010 RESUMED THE VOICE WHO HAS SENT ME A FELLOW LIKE THIS WHO IS HUNGRY AND COLD AND WHO DOES NOT COME IN THE CHILD AT ONCE REPULSED AND INVITED REMAINED MOTIONLESS THE VOICE CONTINUED
6209-34601-0011 YOU ARE TOLD TO COME IN YOU YOUNG RASCAL HE MADE UP HIS MIND AND PLACED ONE FOOT ON THE LOWEST STEP THERE WAS A GREAT GROWL UNDER THE VAN HE DREW BACK THE GAPING JAWS APPEARED
6209-34601-0012 CRIED THE VOICE OF THE MAN THE JAWS RETREATED THE GROWLING CEASED COME UP CONTINUED THE MAN THE CHILD WITH DIFFICULTY CLIMBED UP THE THREE STEPS HE WAS IMPEDED BY THE INFANT
6209-34601-0013 SO BENUMBED ROLLED UP AND ENVELOPED IN THE JACKET THAT NOTHING COULD BE DISTINGUISHED OF HER AND SHE WAS BUT A LITTLE SHAPELESS MASS HE PASSED OVER THE THREE STEPS AND HAVING REACHED THE THRESHOLD STOPPED
6209-34601-0014 NO CANDLE WAS BURNING IN THE CARAVAN PROBABLY FROM THE ECONOMY OF WANT THE HUT WAS LIGHTED ONLY BY A RED TINGE ARISING FROM THE OPENING AT THE TOP OF THE STOVE IN WHICH SPARKLED A PEAT FIRE
6209-34601-0015 ON THE STOVE WERE SMOKING A PORRINGER AND A SAUCEPAN CONTAINING TO ALL APPEARANCE SOMETHING TO EAT THE SAVOURY ODOUR WAS PERCEPTIBLE THE HUT WAS FURNISHED WITH A CHEST
6209-34601-0016 BESIDES TO THE PARTITION WERE ATTACHED SOME BOARDS ON BRACKETS AND SOME HOOKS FROM WHICH HUNG A VARIETY OF THINGS ON THE BOARDS AND NAILS WERE ROWS OF GLASSES COPPERS AN ALEMBIC
6209-34601-0017 A VESSEL RATHER LIKE THOSE USED FOR GRAINING WAX WHICH ARE CALLED GRANULATORS AND A CONFUSION OF STRANGE OBJECTS OF WHICH THE CHILD UNDERSTOOD NOTHING AND WHICH WERE UTENSILS FOR COOKING AND CHEMISTRY THE CARAVAN WAS OBLONG IN SHAPE
6209-34601-0018 THE STOVE BEING IN FRONT IT WAS NOT EVEN A LITTLE ROOM IT WAS SCARCELY A BIG BOX THERE WAS MORE LIGHT OUTSIDE FROM THE SNOW THAN INSIDE FROM THE STOVE EVERYTHING IN THE CARAVAN WAS INDISTINCT AND MISTY
6209-34601-0019 NEVERTHELESS A REFLECTION OF THE FIRE ON THE CEILING ENABLED THE SPECTATOR TO READ IN LARGE LETTERS URSUS PHILOSOPHER THE CHILD IN FACT WAS ENTERING THE HOUSE OF HOMO AND URSUS
6209-34601-0020 THE ONE HE HAD JUST HEARD GROWLING THE OTHER SPEAKING THE CHILD HAVING REACHED THE THRESHOLD PERCEIVED NEAR THE STOVE A MAN TALL SMOOTH THIN AND OLD DRESSED IN GRAY WHOSE HEAD AS HE STOOD
6209-34601-0021 REACHED THE ROOF THE MAN COULD NOT HAVE RAISED HIMSELF ON TIPTOE THE CARAVAN WAS JUST HIS SIZE COME IN SAID THE MAN WHO WAS URSUS THE CHILD ENTERED PUT DOWN YOUR BUNDLE
6209-34601-0022 IS IT THAT YOU ARE AFRAID OF TEARING A HOLE IN YOUR RAGS WORTHLESS VAGABOND IN THE STREETS AT THIS HOUR WHO ARE YOU ANSWER BUT NO I FORBID YOU TO ANSWER THERE YOU ARE COLD
6209-34601-0023 AND WITH FEVERISH HASTE HE DRAGGED OFF THE BOY'S RAGS WHICH TORE INTO SHREDS WITH THE OTHER HE TOOK DOWN FROM A NAIL A MAN'S SHIRT AND ONE OF THOSE KNITTED JACKETS WHICH ARE UP TO THIS DAY CALLED KISS ME QUICKS HERE ARE CLOTHES
6209-34601-0024 AND CHAFED BEFORE THE FIRE THE LIMBS OF THE EXHAUSTED AND BEWILDERED CHILD WHO AT THAT MOMENT WARM AND NAKED FELT AS IF HE WERE SEEING AND TOUCHING HEAVEN THE LIMBS HAVING BEEN RUBBED HE NEXT WIPED THE BOY'S FEET
6209-34601-0025 AND THE MAN SLIPPED THE KNITTED JACKET OVER IT NOW THE MAN KICKED THE STOOL FORWARD AND MADE THE LITTLE BOY SIT DOWN AGAIN SHOVING HIM BY THE SHOULDERS THEN HE POINTED WITH HIS FINGER TO THE PORRINGER WHICH WAS SMOKING UPON THE STOVE
6209-34601-0026 WHAT THE CHILD SAW IN THE PORRINGER WAS AGAIN HEAVEN TO HIM NAMELY A POTATO AND A BIT OF BACON YOU ARE HUNGRY
6209-34601-0027 THE MAN TOOK FROM THE SHELF A CRUST OF HARD BREAD AND AN IRON FORK AND HANDED THEM TO THE CHILD THE BOY HESITATED PERHAPS YOU EXPECT ME TO LAY THE CLOTH SAID THE MAN AND HE PLACED THE PORRINGER ON THE CHILD'S LAP
6209-34601-0028 NOT SO QUICK YOU HORRID GLUTTON ISN'T HE A GREEDY SCOUNDREL
6209-34601-0029 YOU SHOULD SEE A LORD SUP IN MY TIME I HAVE SEEN DUKES EAT THEY DON'T EAT THAT'S NOBLE THEY DRINK HOWEVER COME YOU PIG STUFF YOURSELF THE ABSENCE OF EARS
6209-34601-0030 FOR THE MOMENT HE WAS ABSORBED BY TWO EXIGENCIES AND BY TWO ECSTASIES FOOD AND WARMTH URSUS CONTINUED HIS IMPRECATIONS MUTTERING TO HIMSELF
6209-34601-0031 I HAVE SEEN KING JAMES SUPPING IN PROPRIA PERSONA IN THE BANQUETING HOUSE WHERE ARE TO BE ADMIRED THE PAINTINGS OF THE FAMOUS RUBENS HIS MAJESTY TOUCHED NOTHING THIS BEGGAR HERE BROWSES

6209-34601-0033 I HAVE PLAYED THE FLUTE TO THE HURRICANE I HAVE NOT POCKETED A FARTHING AND NOW TO NIGHT BEGGARS DROP IN HORRID PLACE THERE IS
6209-34601-0034 BATTLE STRUGGLE COMPETITION BETWEEN THE FOOLS IN THE STREET AND MYSELF THEY TRY TO GIVE ME NOTHING BUT FARTHINGS I TRY TO GIVE THEM NOTHING BUT DRUGS WELL TO DAY I'VE MADE NOTHING

6209-34601-0037 SUPPOSE HE WERE TO GIVE IT TO HOMO NO NEVER LET THE POPULACE DIE BUT NOT MY WOLF BUT BY THE BYE I AM HUNGRY MYSELF I DECLARE THAT THIS IS ALL VERY DISAGREEABLE
6209-34601-0038 ONE CRUST OF BREAD A MOUTHFUL OF BACON AND A DROP OF MILK AND I PUT IT TO WARM
625-132112-0000 THIS WAS INDEED THE EGYPT OF THE CONFEDERACY THE RICH GRANARY WHENCE POTATOES AND CORN AND COTTON POURED OUT TO THE FAMISHED AND RAGGED CONFEDERATE TROOPS AS THEY BATTLED FOR A CAUSE LOST LONG BEFORE EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE
625-132112-0001 SHELTERED AND SECURE IT BECAME THE PLACE OF REFUGE FOR FAMILIES WEALTH AND SLAVES YET EVEN THEN THE HARD RUTHLESS RAPE OF THE LAND BEGAN TO TELL THE RED CLAY SUB SOIL ALREADY HAD BEGUN TO PEER ABOVE THE LOAM
625-132112-0002 THE HARDER THE SLAVES WERE DRIVEN THE MORE CARELESS AND FATAL WAS THEIR FARMING THEN CAME THE REVOLUTION OF WAR AND EMANCIPATION THE BEWILDERMENT OF RECONSTRUCTION AND NOW WHAT IS THE EGYPT OF THE CONFEDERACY
625-132112-0003 AND YONDER IN THE FIELD IS HER DARK YOUNG HUSBAND HOEING TO SUPPORT HER AT THIRTY CENTS A DAY WITHOUT BOARD ACROSS THE WAY IS GATESBY BROWN AND TALL LORD OF TWO THOUSAND ACRES SHREWDLY WON AND HELD
625-132112-0004 THERE IS A STORE CONDUCTED BY HIS BLACK SON
625-132112-0005 FIVE MILES BELOW HERE IS A TOWN OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY ONE WHITE NEW ENGLANDER HE OWNS ALMOST A RHODE ISLAND COUNTY WITH THOUSANDS OF ACRES AND HUNDREDS OF BLACK LABORERS
625-132112-0006 THEIR CABINS LOOK BETTER THAN MOST AND THE FARM WITH MACHINERY AND FERTILIZERS IS MUCH MORE BUSINESS LIKE THAN ANY IN THE COUNTY ALTHOUGH THE MANAGER DRIVES HARD BARGAINS IN WAGES WHEN NOW WE TURN AND LOOK FIVE MILES ABOVE
625-132112-0007 THERE ON THE EDGE OF TOWN ARE FIVE HOUSES OF PROSTITUTES TWO OF BLACKS AND THREE OF WHITES AND IN ONE OF THE HOUSES OF THE WHITES A WORTHLESS BLACK BOY WAS HARBORED TOO OPENLY TWO YEARS AGO SO HE WAS HANGED FOR RAPE
625-132112-0008 AND HERE TOO IS THE HIGH WHITEWASHED FENCE OF THE STOCKADE AS THE COUNTY PRISON IS CALLED THE WHITE FOLKS SAY IT IS EVER FULL OF BLACK CRIMINALS THE BLACK FOLKS SAY THAT ONLY COLORED BOYS ARE SENT TO JAIL
625-132112-0009 AND THEY NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE GUILTY BUT BECAUSE THE STATE NEEDS CRIMINALS TO EKE OUT ITS INCOME BY THEIR FORCED LABOR IMMIGRANTS ARE HEIRS OF THE SLAVE BARON IN DOUGHERTY AND AS WE RIDE WESTWARD BY WIDE STRETCHING CORNFIELDS AND STUBBY ORCHARDS OF PEACH AND PEAR
625-132112-0010 WE SEE ON ALL SIDES WITHIN THE CIRCLE OF DARK FOREST A LAND OF CANAAN HERE AND THERE ARE TALES OF PROJECTS FOR MONEY GETTING BORN IN THE SWIFT DAYS OF RECONSTRUCTION
625-132112-0011 IMPROVEMENT COMPANIES WINE COMPANIES MILLS AND FACTORIES MOST FAILED AND FOREIGNERS FELL HEIR IT IS A BEAUTIFUL LAND THIS DOUGHERTY WEST OF THE FLINT THE FORESTS ARE WONDERFUL
625-132112-0012 THE SOLEMN PINES HAVE DISAPPEARED AND THIS IS THE OAKEY WOODS WITH ITS WEALTH OF HICKORIES BEECHES OAKS AND PALMETTOS BUT A PALL OF DEBT HANGS OVER THE BEAUTIFUL LAND THE MERCHANTS ARE IN DEBT TO THE WHOLESALERS
625-132112-0013 THE PLANTERS ARE IN DEBT TO THE MERCHANTS THE TENANTS OWE THE PLANTERS AND LABORERS BOW AND BEND BENEATH THE BURDEN OF IT ALL HERE AND THERE A MAN HAS RAISED HIS HEAD ABOVE THESE MURKY WATERS
625-132112-0014 WE PASSED ONE FENCED STOCK FARM WITH GRASS AND GRAZING CATTLE THAT LOOKED VERY HOME LIKE AFTER ENDLESS CORN AND COTTON HERE AND THERE ARE BLACK FREE HOLDERS THERE IS THE GAUNT DULL BLACK JACKSON WITH HIS HUNDRED ACRES
625-132112-0015 I SAYS LOOK UP IF YOU DON'T LOOK UP YOU CAN'T GET UP REMARKS JACKSON PHILOSOPHICALLY AND HE'S GOTTEN UP DARK CARTER'S NEAT BARNS WOULD DO CREDIT TO NEW ENGLAND HIS MASTER HELPED HIM TO GET A START
625-132112-0016 BUT WHEN THE BLACK MAN DIED LAST FALL THE MASTER'S SONS IMMEDIATELY LAID CLAIM TO THE ESTATE AND THEM WHITE FOLKS WILL GET IT TOO SAID MY YELLOW GOSSIP I TURN FROM THESE WELL TENDED ACRES WITH A COMFORTABLE FEELING THAT THE NEGRO IS RISING
625-132112-0017 EVEN THEN HOWEVER THE FIELDS AS WE PROCEED BEGIN TO REDDEN AND THE TREES DISAPPEAR ROWS OF OLD CABINS APPEAR FILLED WITH RENTERS AND LABORERS CHEERLESS BARE AND DIRTY FOR THE MOST PART ALTHOUGH HERE AND THERE
625-132112-0018 SO HE MOVED HERE WHERE THE RENT IS HIGHER THE LAND POORER AND THE OWNER INFLEXIBLE HE RENTS A FORTY DOLLAR MULE FOR TWENTY DOLLARS A YEAR POOR LAD A SLAVE AT TWENTY TWO THIS PLANTATION OWNED NOW BY A FOREIGNER
625-132112-0019 WAS A PART OF THE FAMOUS BOLTON ESTATE AFTER THE WAR IT WAS FOR MANY YEARS WORKED BY GANGS OF NEGRO CONVICTS AND BLACK CONVICTS THEN WERE EVEN MORE PLENTIFUL THAN NOW IT WAS A WAY OF MAKING NEGROES WORK AND THE QUESTION OF GUILT WAS A MINOR ONE
625-132112-0020 HARD TALES OF CRUELTY AND MISTREATMENT OF THE CHAINED FREEMEN ARE TOLD BUT THE COUNTY AUTHORITIES WERE DEAF UNTIL THE FREE LABOR MARKET WAS NEARLY RUINED BY WHOLESALE MIGRATION THEN THEY TOOK THE CONVICTS FROM THE PLANTATIONS
625-132112-0021 BUT NOT UNTIL ONE OF THE FAIREST REGIONS OF THE OAKEY WOODS HAD BEEN RUINED AND RAVISHED INTO A RED WASTE OUT OF WHICH ONLY A YANKEE OR AN IMMIGRANT COULD SQUEEZE MORE BLOOD FROM DEBT CURSED TENANTS NO WONDER THAT LUKE BLACK
625-132112-0022 SLOW DULL AND DISCOURAGED SHUFFLES TO OUR CARRIAGE AND TALKS HOPELESSLY WHY SHOULD HE STRIVE EVERY YEAR FINDS HIM DEEPER IN DEBT HOW STRANGE THAT GEORGIA THE WORLD HERALDED REFUGE OF POOR DEBTORS
625-132112-0023 SHOULD BIND HER OWN TO SLOTH AND MISFORTUNE AS RUTHLESSLY AS EVER ENGLAND DID THE POOR LAND GROANS WITH ITS BIRTH PAINS AND BRINGS FORTH SCARCELY A HUNDRED POUNDS OF COTTON TO THE ACRE WHERE FIFTY YEARS AGO
625-132112-0024 TWENTY YEARS YONDER SUNKEN CHEEKED OLD BLACK MAN HAS LABORED UNDER THAT SYSTEM AND NOW TURNED DAY LABORER IS SUPPORTING HIS WIFE AND BOARDING HIMSELF ON HIS WAGES OF A DOLLAR AND A HALF A WEEK RECEIVED ONLY PART OF THE YEAR
625-132112-0025 THE BOLTON CONVICT FARM FORMERLY INCLUDED THE NEIGHBORING PLANTATION HERE IT WAS THAT THE CONVICTS WERE LODGED IN THE GREAT LOG PRISON STILL STANDING A DISMAL PLACE IT STILL REMAINS WITH ROWS OF UGLY HUTS
625-132112-0026 UNSHADED WITH NO CHARM OF PAST ASSOCIATION ONLY A MEMORY OF FORCED HUMAN TOIL NOW THEN AND BEFORE THE WAR THEY ARE NOT HAPPY THESE BLACK MEN WHOM WE MEET THROUGHOUT THIS REGION
625-132112-0027 THERE IS LITTLE OF THE JOYOUS ABANDON AND PLAYFULNESS WHICH WE ARE WONT TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE PLANTATION NEGRO AT BEST THE NATURAL GOOD NATURE IS EDGED WITH COMPLAINT OR HAS CHANGED INTO SULLENNESS AND GLOOM
625-132112-0028 AND STILL HAVING NOTHING TO BE SURE HE HAD GIVEN FOUR CHILDREN A COMMON SCHOOL TRAINING AND PERHAPS IF THE NEW FENCE LAW HAD NOT ALLOWED UNFENCED CROPS IN WEST DOUGHERTY HE MIGHT HAVE RAISED A LITTLE STOCK AND KEPT AHEAD
625-132112-0029 AS IT IS HE IS HOPELESSLY IN DEBT DISAPPOINTED AND EMBITTERED HE STOPPED US TO INQUIRE AFTER THE BLACK BOY IN ALBANY WHOM IT WAS SAID A POLICEMAN HAD SHOT AND KILLED FOR LOUD TALKING ON THE SIDEWALK
625-132112-0030 AND THEN HE SAID SLOWLY LET A WHITE MAN TOUCH ME AND HE DIES I DON'T BOAST THIS I DON'T SAY IT AROUND LOUD OR BEFORE THE CHILDREN BUT I MEAN IT
625-132112-0031 AND WE PASSED ON NOW SEARS
625-132112-0032 HAPPY WELL YES HE LAUGHED AND FLIPPED PEBBLES AND THOUGHT THE WORLD WAS AS IT WAS HE HAD WORKED HERE TWELVE YEARS AND HAS NOTHING BUT A MORTGAGED MULE CHILDREN YES SEVEN BUT THEY HADN'T BEEN TO SCHOOL THIS YEAR
625-132112-0033 COULDN'T AFFORD BOOKS AND CLOTHES AND COULDN'T SPARE THEIR WORK THERE GO PART OF THEM TO THE FIELDS NOW THREE BIG BOYS ASTRIDE MULES AND A STRAPPING GIRL WITH BARE BROWN LEGS
625-132112-0034 HERE AND THERE WE MEET DISTINCT CHARACTERS QUITE OUT OF THE ORDINARY ONE CAME OUT OF A PIECE OF NEWLY CLEARED GROUND MAKING A WIDE DETOUR TO AVOID THE SNAKES HE WAS AN OLD HOLLOW CHEEKED MAN WITH A DRAWN
625-132112-0035 MADE NOTHING FOR TWO YEARS BUT I RECKON I'VE GOT A CROP NOW THE COTTON LOOKED TALL AND RICH AND WE PRAISED IT HE CURTSIED LOW AND THEN BOWED ALMOST TO THE GROUND
625-132112-0036 WITH AN IMPERTURBABLE GRAVITY THAT SEEMED ALMOST SUSPICIOUS THEN HE CONTINUED MY MULE DIED LAST WEEK A CALAMITY IN THIS LAND EQUAL TO A DEVASTATING FIRE IN TOWN
625-132112-0037 BUT A WHITE MAN LOANED ME ANOTHER THEN HE ADDED EYEING US
625-132112-0038 THE WHISTLE PLACE WHICH INCLUDES HIS BIT OF LAND WAS BOUGHT SOON AFTER THE WAR BY AN ENGLISH SYNDICATE THE DIXIE COTTON AND CORN COMPANY A MARVELLOUS DEAL OF STYLE THEIR FACTOR PUT ON WITH HIS SERVANTS AND COACH AND SIX SO MUCH SO
625-132112-0039 THAT THE CONCERN SOON LANDED IN INEXTRICABLE BANKRUPTCY NOBODY LIVES IN THE OLD HOUSE NOW BUT A MAN COMES EACH WINTER OUT OF THE NORTH AND COLLECTS HIS HIGH RENTS I KNOW NOT WHICH ARE THE MORE TOUCHING SUCH OLD EMPTY HOUSES
625-132112-0040 OR THE HOMES OF THE MASTERS SONS SAD AND BITTER TALES LIE HIDDEN BACK OF THOSE WHITE DOORS TALES OF POVERTY OF STRUGGLE OF DISAPPOINTMENT A REVOLUTION SUCH AS THAT OF SIXTY THREE IS A TERRIBLE THING
625-132112-0041 FOR MONEY MONEY WHERE WAS IT TO COME FROM AND SO THE SON ROSE IN THE NIGHT AND KILLED HIS BABY AND KILLED HIS WIFE AND SHOT HIMSELF DEAD AND THE WORLD PASSED ON
625-132112-0042 I REMEMBER WHEELING AROUND A BEND IN THE ROAD BESIDE A GRACEFUL BIT OF FOREST AND A SINGING BROOK A LONG LOW HOUSE FACED US WITH PORCH AND FLYING PILLARS GREAT OAKEN DOOR AND A BROAD LAWN SHINING IN THE EVENING SUN
625-132112-0043 BUT THE WINDOW PANES WERE GONE THE PILLARS WERE WORM EATEN AND THE MOSS GROWN ROOF WAS FALLING IN HALF CURIOUSLY I PEERED THROUGH THE UNHINGED DOOR AND SAW WHERE ON THE WALL ACROSS THE HALL
625-132112-0044 WELCOME QUITE A CONTRAST TO THE SOUTHWESTERN PART OF DOUGHERTY COUNTY IS THE NORTHWEST SOBERLY TIMBERED IN OAK AND PINE IT HAS NONE OF THAT HALF TROPICAL LUXURIANCE OF THE SOUTHWEST
625-132112-0045 THEN TOO THERE ARE FEWER SIGNS OF A ROMANTIC PAST AND MORE OF SYSTEMATIC MODERN LAND GRABBING AND MONEY GETTING WHITE PEOPLE ARE MORE IN EVIDENCE HERE
625-132112-0046 AND THERE WERE FENCES AND MEADOWS HERE AND THERE MOST OF THIS LAND WAS POOR AND BENEATH THE NOTICE OF THE SLAVE BARON BEFORE THE WAR SINCE THEN HIS POOR RELATIONS AND FOREIGN IMMIGRANTS HAVE SEIZED IT
625-132112-0047 THE RETURNS OF THE FARMER ARE TOO SMALL TO ALLOW MUCH FOR WAGES AND YET HE WILL NOT SELL OFF SMALL FARMS THERE IS THE NEGRO SANFORD HE HAS WORKED FOURTEEN YEARS AS OVERSEER ON THE LADSON PLACE AND
625-132112-0048 BUT THE OWNER WILL NOT SELL OFF A FEW ACRES TWO CHILDREN A BOY AND A GIRL ARE HOEING STURDILY IN THE FIELDS ON THE FARM WHERE CORLISS WORKS HE IS SMOOTH FACED AND BROWN AND IS FENCING UP HIS PIGS
625-132112-0049 FOR PA WILLIS WAS THE TALL AND POWERFUL BLACK MOSES WHO LED THE NEGROES FOR A GENERATION AND LED THEM WELL HE WAS A BAPTIST PREACHER AND WHEN HE DIED TWO THOUSAND BLACK PEOPLE FOLLOWED HIM TO THE GRAVE AND NOW THEY PREACH HIS FUNERAL SERMON EACH YEAR
625-132112-0050 A WEAZENED SHARP FEATURED LITTLE WOMAN WHO CURTSIED QUAINTLY AS WE GREETED HER FURTHER ON LIVES JACK DELSON THE MOST PROSPEROUS NEGRO FARMER IN THE COUNTY IT IS A JOY TO MEET HIM
625-132112-0051 A GREAT BROAD SHOULDERED HANDSOME BLACK MAN INTELLIGENT AND JOVIAL SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY ACRES HE OWNS AND HAS ELEVEN BLACK TENANTS A NEAT AND TIDY HOME NESTLED IN A FLOWER GARDEN AND A LITTLE STORE STANDS BESIDE IT
625-132112-0052 WE PASS THE MUNSON PLACE WHERE A PLUCKY WHITE WIDOW IS RENTING AND STRUGGLING AND THE ELEVEN HUNDRED ACRES OF THE SENNET PLANTATION WITH ITS NEGRO OVERSEER
625-132112-0053 THEN THE CHARACTER OF THE FARMS BEGINS TO CHANGE
625-132112-0054 THE OVERSEERS ARE WHITE AND THE CABINS ARE BARE BOARD HOUSES SCATTERED HERE AND THERE THE RENTS ARE HIGH AND DAY LABORERS AND CONTRACT HANDS ABOUND IT IS A KEEN HARD STRUGGLE FOR LIVING HERE
625-132112-0055 AND FEW HAVE TIME TO TALK TIRED WITH THE LONG RIDE WE GLADLY DRIVE INTO GILLONSVILLE IT IS A SILENT CLUSTER OF FARMHOUSES STANDING ON THE CROSSROADS WITH ONE OF ITS STORES CLOSED AND THE OTHER KEPT BY A NEGRO PREACHER
625-132112-0056 IT WAS ONE OF THOSE SCENES ONE CANNOT SOON FORGET A WIDE LOW LITTLE HOUSE WHOSE MOTHERLY ROOF REACHED OVER AND SHELTERED A SNUG LITTLE PORCH THERE WE SAT AFTER THE LONG HOT DRIVE DRINKING COOL WATER
625-132112-0057 THE TALKATIVE LITTLE STOREKEEPER WHO IS MY DAILY COMPANION THE SILENT OLD BLACK WOMAN PATCHING PANTALOONS AND SAYING NEVER A WORD THE RAGGED PICTURE OF HELPLESS MISFORTUNE WHO CALLED IN JUST TO SEE THE PREACHER AND FINALLY THE NEAT
625-132112-0058 MATRONLY PREACHER'S WIFE PLUMP YELLOW AND INTELLIGENT OWN LAND SAID THE WIFE WELL ONLY THIS HOUSE THEN SHE ADDED QUIETLY WE DID BUY SEVEN HUNDRED ACRES ACROSS UP YONDER AND PAID FOR IT BUT THEY CHEATED US OUT OF IT
625-132118-0000 OF THE PASSING OF THE FIRST BORN
625-132118-0001 THOU HAST FORGOTTEN O SUMMER SWALLOW BUT THE WORLD SHALL END WHEN I FORGET SWINBURNE
625-132118-0002 SANG THE BIT OF YELLOW PAPER THAT FLUTTERED INTO MY ROOM ONE BROWN OCTOBER MORNING THEN THE FEAR OF FATHERHOOD MINGLED WILDLY WITH THE JOY OF CREATION I WONDERED HOW IT LOOKED
625-132118-0003 WHILE I WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY WANDERING I FLED TO MY WIFE AND CHILD REPEATING THE WHILE TO MYSELF HALF WONDERINGLY WIFE AND CHILD WIFE AND CHILD
625-132118-0004 FLED FAST AND FASTER THAN BOAT AND STEAM CAR AND YET MUST EVER IMPATIENTLY AWAIT THEM AWAY FROM THE HARD VOICED CITY
625-132118-0005 INTO MY OWN BERKSHIRE HILLS THAT SIT ALL SADLY GUARDING THE GATES OF MASSACHUSETTS UP THE STAIRS I RAN TO THE WAN MOTHER AND WHIMPERING BABE TO THE SANCTUARY ON WHOSE ALTAR A LIFE AT MY BIDDING
625-132118-0006 HAD OFFERED ITSELF TO WIN A LIFE AND WON WHAT IS THIS TINY FORMLESS THING THIS NEWBORN WAIL FROM AN UNKNOWN WORLD ALL HEAD AND VOICE
625-132118-0007 I HANDLE IT CURIOUSLY AND WATCH PERPLEXED ITS WINKING BREATHING AND SNEEZING I DID NOT LOVE IT THEN IT SEEMED A LUDICROUS THING TO LOVE BUT HER I LOVED
625-132118-0008 MY GIRL MOTHER SHE WHOM NOW I SAW UNFOLDING LIKE THE GLORY OF THE MORNING THE TRANSFIGURED WOMAN THROUGH HER I CAME TO LOVE THE WEE THING AS IT GREW STRONG
625-132118-0009 AS ITS LITTLE SOUL UNFOLDED ITSELF IN TWITTER AND CRY AND HALF FORMED WORD AND AS ITS EYES CAUGHT THE GLEAM AND FLASH OF LIFE HOW BEAUTIFUL HE WAS
625-132118-0010 HELD HIM AND GLANCED AT THE HOT RED SOIL OF GEORGIA AND THE BREATHLESS CITY OF A HUNDRED HILLS AND FELT A VAGUE UNREST WHY WAS HIS HAIR
625-132118-0011 I SAW AS IT FELL ACROSS MY BABY THE SHADOW OF THE VEIL WITHIN THE VEIL WAS HE BORN SAID I AND THERE WITHIN SHALL HE LIVE A NEGRO AND A NEGRO'S SON
625-132118-0012 BITTERLY HE UNBOWED PRIDE OF A HUNTED RACE CLINGING WITH THAT TINY DIMPLED HAND AH WEARILY TO A HOPE NOT HOPELESS BUT UNHOPEFUL
625-132118-0013 AND SEEING WITH THOSE BRIGHT WONDERING EYES THAT PEER INTO MY SOUL A LAND WHOSE FREEDOM IS TO US A MOCKERY AND WHOSE LIBERTY A LIE
625-132118-0014 I SAW THE SHADOW OF THE VEIL AS IT PASSED OVER MY BABY I SAW THE COLD CITY TOWERING ABOVE THE BLOOD RED LAND I HELD MY FACE BESIDE HIS LITTLE CHEEK
625-132118-0015 SHOWED HIM THE STAR CHILDREN AND THE TWINKLING LIGHTS AS THEY BEGAN TO FLASH AND STILLED WITH AN EVEN SONG THE UNVOICED TERROR OF MY LIFE SO STURDY AND MASTERFUL HE GREW SO FILLED WITH BUBBLING LIFE
625-132118-0016 HE TINGED HER EVERY DREAM AND IDEALIZED HER EVERY EFFORT NO HANDS BUT HERS MUST TOUCH AND GARNISH THOSE LITTLE LIMBS NO DRESS OR FRILL MUST TOUCH THEM THAT HAD NOT WEARIED HER FINGERS
625-132118-0017 NO VOICE BUT HERS COULD COAX HIM OFF TO DREAMLAND AND SHE AND HE TOGETHER SPOKE SOME SOFT AND UNKNOWN TONGUE AND IN IT HELD COMMUNION I TOO MUSED ABOVE HIS LITTLE WHITE BED
625-132118-0018 THROUGH THE NEWER STRENGTH OF HIS SAW THE DREAM OF MY BLACK FATHERS STAGGER A STEP ONWARD IN THE WILD PHANTASM OF THE WORLD HEARD IN HIS BABY VOICE THE VOICE OF THE PROPHET
625-132118-0019 THAT WAS TO RISE WITHIN THE VEIL AND SO WE DREAMED AND LOVED AND PLANNED BY FALL AND WINTER AND THE FULL FLUSH OF THE LONG SOUTHERN SPRING
625-132118-0020 TILL THE HOT WINDS ROLLED FROM THE FETID GULF TILL THE ROSES SHIVERED AND THE STILL STERN SUN QUIVERED ITS AWFUL LIGHT OVER THE HILLS OF ATLANTA AND THEN ONE NIGHT THE LITTLE FEET PATTERED WEARILY TO THE WEE WHITE BED
625-132118-0021 AND THE TINY HANDS TREMBLED AND A WARM FLUSHED FACE TOSSED ON THE PILLOW AND WE KNEW BABY WAS SICK TEN DAYS HE LAY THERE A SWIFT WEEK
625-132118-0022 OUT INTO THE STARLIGHT I CREPT TO ROUSE THE GRAY PHYSICIAN THE SHADOW OF DEATH THE SHADOW OF DEATH THE HOURS TREMBLED ON THE NIGHT LISTENED
625-132118-0023 AND THEN HIS LITTLE SOUL LEAPT LIKE A STAR THAT TRAVELS IN THE NIGHT AND LEFT A WORLD OF DARKNESS IN ITS TRAIN THE DAY CHANGED NOT
625-132118-0024 THE SAME TALL TREES PEEPED IN AT THE WINDOWS THE SAME GREEN GRASS GLINTED IN THE SETTING SUN ONLY IN THE CHAMBER OF DEATH WRITHED THE WORLD'S MOST PITEOUS THING A CHILDLESS MOTHER
625-132118-0025 I SHIRK NOT I LONG FOR WORK I PANT FOR A LIFE FULL OF STRIVING I AM NO COWARD TO SHRINK BEFORE THE RUGGED RUSH OF THE STORM NOR EVEN QUAIL BEFORE THE AWFUL SHADOW OF THE VEIL BUT HEARKEN O DEATH

625-132118-0029 AND THE CHILDREN HOVERED AND FLUTTERED ABOUT HIM I CAN SEE HIM NOW CHANGING LIKE THE SKY FROM SPARKLING LAUGHTER TO DARKENING FROWNS AND THEN TO WONDERING THOUGHTFULNESS AS HE WATCHED THE WORLD
625-132118-0030 HE KNEW NO COLOR LINE POOR DEAR AND THE VEIL THOUGH IT SHADOWED HIM HAD NOT YET DARKENED HALF HIS SUN HE LOVED THE WHITE MATRON HE LOVED HIS BLACK NURSE
625-132118-0031 AND IN HIS LITTLE WORLD WALKED SOULS ALONE UNCOLORED AND UNCLOTHED I YEA ALL MEN ARE LARGER AND PURER BY THE INFINITE BREADTH OF THAT ONE LITTLE LIFE
625-132118-0032 SHE WHO IN SIMPLE CLEARNESS OF VISION SEES BEYOND THE STARS SAID WHEN HE HAD FLOWN HE WILL BE HAPPY THERE HE EVER LOVED BEAUTIFUL THINGS
625-132118-0033 AND I FAR MORE IGNORANT AND BLIND BY THE WEB OF MINE OWN WEAVING SIT ALONE WINDING WORDS AND MUTTERING IF STILL HE BE AND HE BE THERE AND THERE BE A THERE
625-132118-0034 LET HIM BE HAPPY O FATE BLITHE WAS THE MORNING OF HIS BURIAL WITH BIRD AND SONG AND SWEET SMELLING FLOWERS THE TREES WHISPERED TO THE GRASS
625-132118-0035 THEY DID NOT SAY MUCH THOSE PALE FACED HURRYING MEN AND WOMEN THEY DID NOT SAY MUCH THEY ONLY GLANCED AND SAID NIGGERS
625-132118-0036 IN VAIN FOR WHERE O GOD BENEATH THY BROAD BLUE SKY SHALL MY DARK BABY REST IN PEACE WHERE REVERENCE DWELLS AND GOODNESS AND A FREEDOM THAT IS FREE
625-132118-0037 ALL THAT DAY AND ALL THAT NIGHT THERE SAT AN AWFUL GLADNESS IN MY HEART NAY BLAME ME NOT IF I SEE THE WORLD THUS DARKLY THROUGH THE VEIL AND MY SOUL WHISPERS EVER TO ME SAYING NOT DEAD
625-132118-0038 NO TAUNT SHALL MADDEN HIS HAPPY BOYHOOD FOOL THAT I WAS TO THINK OR WISH THAT THIS LITTLE SOUL SHOULD GROW CHOKED AND DEFORMED WITHIN THE VEIL I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN THAT YONDER DEEP
625-132118-0039 WHICH HIS FATHER HAD HARDLY CRUSHED IN HIS OWN HEART FOR WHAT FORSOOTH SHALL A NEGRO WANT WITH PRIDE AMID THE STUDIED HUMILIATIONS OF FIFTY MILLION FELLOWS WELL SPED MY BOY
625-132118-0040 BEFORE THE WORLD HAD DUBBED YOUR AMBITION INSOLENCE HAD HELD YOUR IDEALS UNATTAINABLE AND TAUGHT YOU TO CRINGE AND BOW
625-132118-0041 BETTER FAR THIS NAMELESS VOID THAT STOPS MY LIFE THAN A SEA OF SORROW FOR YOU IDLE WORDS
625-132118-0042 AYE AND FOUND IT LIGHTER TOO SOME DAY FOR SURELY SURELY THIS IS NOT THE END
625-132118-0043 SURELY THERE SHALL YET DAWN SOME MIGHTY MORNING TO LIFT THE VEIL AND SET THE PRISONED FREE NOT FOR ME I SHALL DIE IN MY BONDS BUT FOR FRESH YOUNG SOULS WHO HAVE NOT KNOWN THE NIGHT
625-132118-0044 AND WAKEN TO THE MORNING A MORNING WHEN MEN ASK OF THE WORKMAN NOT IS HE WHITE BUT CAN HE WORK WHEN MEN ASK ARTISTS NOT ARE THEY BLACK BUT DO THEY KNOW
625-132118-0045 SOME MORNING THIS MAY BE LONG LONG YEARS TO COME BUT NOW THERE WAILS ON THAT DARK SHORE WITHIN THE VEIL THE SAME DEEP VOICE THOU SHALT FOREGO
625-132118-0046 AND ALL HAVE I FOREGONE AT THAT COMMAND AND WITH SMALL COMPLAINT ALL SAVE THAT FAIR YOUNG FORM THAT LIES SO COLDLY WED WITH DEATH
625-132118-0047 IN THE NEST I HAD BUILDED IF ONE MUST HAVE GONE WHY NOT I WHY MAY I NOT REST ME FROM THIS RESTLESSNESS AND SLEEP FROM THIS WIDE WAKING
625-132118-0048 WAS NOT THE WORLD'S ALEMBIC TIME IN HIS YOUNG HANDS AND IS NOT MY TIME WANING ARE THERE SO MANY WORKERS IN THE VINEYARD THAT THE FAIR PROMISE OF THIS LITTLE BODY
625-132118-0049 COULD LIGHTLY BE TOSSED AWAY THE WRETCHED OF MY RACE THAT LINE THE ALLEYS OF THE NATION SIT FATHERLESS AND UNMOTHERED
625-132118-0050 SLEEP THEN CHILD SLEEP TILL I SLEEP AND WAKEN TO A BABY VOICE AND THE CEASELESS PATTER OF LITTLE FEET
6367-65536-0000 THE MAN HALTED ON THE CREST OF THE HILL AND LOOKED SOMBRELY DOWN INTO THE LONG VALLEY BELOW IT WAS EVENING AND ALTHOUGH THE HILLS AROUND HIM WERE STILL IN THE LIGHT THE VALLEY WAS ALREADY FILLED WITH KINDLY PLACID SHADOWS
6367-65536-0001 IT HAD BEEN BY THESE FIRS HE HAD HALTED TWENTY YEARS AGO TURNING FOR ONE LAST GLANCE AT THE VALLEY BELOW THE HOME VALLEY WHICH HE HAD NEVER SEEN SINCE BUT THEN
6367-65536-0002 THE FIRS HAD BEEN LITTLE MORE THAN VIGOROUS YOUNG SAPLINGS THEY WERE TALL GNARLED TREES NOW WITH LICHENED TRUNKS AND THEIR LOWER BOUGHS WERE DEAD BUT HIGH UP THEIR TOPS WERE GREEN AND CAUGHT THE SAFFRON LIGHT OF THE WEST
6367-65536-0003 HE REMEMBERED THAT WHEN A BOY HE HAD THOUGHT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE EVENING SUNSHINE FALLING ATHWART THE DARK GREEN FIR BOUGHS ON THE HILLS AS HE LISTENED TO THE SWISH AND MURMUR OF THE WIND
6367-65536-0004 THE EARTH OLD TUNE WITH THE POWER TO CARRY THE SOUL BACK TO THE DAWN OF TIME THE YEARS FELL AWAY FROM HIM AND HE FORGOT MUCH REMEMBERING MORE
6367-65536-0005 HE HAD CALLED THAT LONGING BY OTHER NAMES BUT HE KNEW IT NOW FOR WHAT IT WAS WHEN HEARING HE WAS SATISFIED HE WAS A TALL MAN WITH IRON GREY HAIR AND THE FACE OF A CONQUEROR STRONG
6367-65536-0006 PITILESS UNSWERVING EAGLE EYES QUICK TO DISCERN AND UNFALTERING TO PURSUE JAW SQUARE AND INTREPID MOUTH FORMED TO KEEP SECRETS AND CAJOLE MEN TO HIS WILL
6367-65536-0007 A FACE THAT HID MUCH AND REVEALED LITTLE IT TOLD OF POWER AND INTELLECT BUT THE SOUL OF THE MAN WAS A HIDDEN THING
6367-65536-0008 NOT IN THE ARENA WHERE HE HAD FOUGHT AND TRIUMPHED GIVING FIERCE BLOW FOR BLOW WAS IT TO BE SHOWN BUT HERE LOOKING DOWN ON THE HOMELAND WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE HILLS ABOUT HIM IT ROSE DOMINANTLY AND CLAIMED ITS OWN
6367-65536-0009 THE OLD BOND HELD YONDER BELOW HIM WAS HOME THE OLD HOUSE THAT HAD SHELTERED HIM THE GRAVES OF HIS KIN THE WIDE FIELDS WHERE HIS BOYHOOD DREAMS HAD BEEN DREAMED
6367-65536-0010 THE PITTING OF STRENGTH AND CRAFT AGAINST STRENGTH AND CRAFT THE TIRELESS STRUGGLE THE EXULTATION OF VICTORY THEN SUDDENLY THEY HAD FAILED THEIR WORSHIPPER THEY CEASED TO SATISFY
6367-65536-0011 THE SACRIFICES HE HAD HEAPED ON THEIR ALTARS AVAILED HIM NOTHING IN THIS NEW NEED AND HUNGER OF HIS BEING HIS GODS MOCKED HIM AND HE WEARIED OF THEIR SERVICE WERE THERE NOT BETTER THINGS THAN THESE
6367-65536-0012 THINGS HE HAD ONCE KNOWN AND LOVED AND FORGOTTEN WHERE WERE THE IDEALS OF HIS YOUTH THE LOFTY ASPIRATIONS THAT HAD UPBORNE HIM THEN WHERE WAS THE EAGERNESS AND ZEST OF NEW DAWNS
6367-65536-0013 THE EARNESTNESS OF WELL FILLED PURPOSEFUL HOURS OF LABOUR THE SATISFACTION OF A GOOD DAY WORTHILY LIVED AT EVENTIDE THE UNBROKEN REST OF LONG STARRY NIGHTS WHERE MIGHT HE FIND THEM AGAIN
6367-65536-0014 WERE THEY YET TO BE HAD FOR THE SEEKING IN THE OLD VALLEY WITH THE THOUGHT CAME A GREAT YEARNING FOR HOME HE HAD HAD MANY HABITATIONS BUT HE REALIZED NOW THAT HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF ANY OF THESE PLACES AS HOME
6367-65536-0015 THAT NAME HAD ALL UNCONSCIOUSLY BEEN KEPT SACRED TO THE LONG GREEN SEAWARD LOOKING GLEN WHERE HE HAD BEEN BORN SO HE HAD COME BACK TO IT DRAWN BY A LONGING NOT TO BE RESISTED
6367-65536-0016 BUT AT THE LAST HE FELT AFRAID THERE HAD BEEN MANY CHANGES OF THAT HE FELT SURE WOULD IT STILL BE HOME AND IF NOT WOULD NOT THE LOSS BE MOST IRREPARABLE AND BITTER
6367-65536-0017 WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER TO GO AWAY HAVING LOOKED AT IT FROM THE HILL AND HAVING HEARD THE SAGA OF THE FIRS KEEPING HIS MEMORY OF IT UNBLURRED THAN RISK THE PROBABLE DISILLUSION OF A RETURN TO THE PLACES THAT HAD FORGOTTEN HIM
6367-65536-0018 AND FRIENDS WHOM THE VARYING YEARS MUST CERTAINLY HAVE CHANGED AS HE HAD CHANGED HIMSELF NO HE WOULD NOT GO DOWN IT HAD BEEN A FOOLISH WHIM TO COME AT ALL
6367-65536-0019 FOOLISH BECAUSE THE OBJECT OF HIS QUEST WAS NOT TO BE FOUND THERE OR ELSEWHERE HE COULD NOT ENTER AGAIN INTO THE HERITAGE OF BOYHOOD AND THE HEART OF YOUTH HE COULD NOT FIND THERE THE OLD DREAMS AND HOPES THAT HAD MADE LIFE SWEET
6367-65536-0020 HE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE COULD NOT BRING BACK TO THE OLD VALLEY WHAT HE HAD TAKEN FROM IT HE HAD LOST THAT INTANGIBLE ALL REAL WEALTH OF FAITH AND IDEALISM AND ZEST
6367-65536-0021 AND HE REALIZED AT LAST HOW MUCH POORER HE WAS THAN WHEN HE HAD LEFT THAT HOME VALLEY HIS WAS A NAME THAT STOOD FOR MILLIONS BUT HE WAS BEGGARED OF HOPE AND PURPOSE NO HE WOULD NOT GO DOWN
6367-65536-0022 THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT THERE UNCHANGED AND UNCHANGING TO WELCOME HIM HE WOULD BE A STRANGER THERE EVEN AMONG HIS KIN HE WOULD STAY AWHILE ON THE HILL UNTIL THE NIGHT CAME DOWN OVER IT
6367-65536-0023 AND THEN HE WOULD GO BACK TO HIS OWN PLACE DOWN BELOW HIM ON THE CREST OF A LITTLE UPLAND HE SAW HIS OLD HOME A WEATHER GREY HOUSE ALMOST HIDDEN AMONG WHITE BIRCH AND APPLE TREES
6367-65536-0024 WITH A THICK FIR GROVE TO THE NORTH OF IT HE HAD BEEN BORN IN THAT OLD HOUSE HIS EARLIEST MEMORY WAS OF STANDING ON ITS THRESHOLD AND LOOKING AFAR UP TO THE LONG GREEN HILLS WHAT IS OVER THE HILLS HE HAD ASKED OF HIS MOTHER
6367-65536-0025 WITH A SMILE SHE HAD MADE ANSWER MANY THINGS LADDIE WONDERFUL THINGS BEAUTIFUL THINGS HEART BREAKING THINGS SOME DAY I SHALL GO OVER THE HILLS AND FIND THEM ALL MOTHER
6367-65536-0026 HE HAD SAID STOUTLY SHE HAD LAUGHED AND SIGHED AND CAUGHT HIM TO HER HEART HE HAD NO RECOLLECTION OF HIS FATHER WHO HAD DIED SOON AFTER HIS SON'S BIRTH BUT HOW WELL HE REMEMBERED HIS MOTHER
6367-65536-0027 HIS LITTLE BROWN EYED GIRLISH FACED MOTHER HE HAD LIVED ON THE HOMESTEAD UNTIL HE WAS TWENTY HE HAD TILLED THE BROAD FIELDS AND GONE IN AND OUT AMONG THE PEOPLE AND THEIR LIFE HAD BEEN HIS LIFE BUT HIS HEART WAS NOT IN HIS WORK
6367-65536-0028 HE WANTED TO GO BEYOND THE HILLS AND SEEK WHAT HE KNEW MUST BE THERE THE VALLEY WAS TOO NARROW TOO PLACID HE LONGED FOR CONFLICT AND ACCOMPLISHMENT
6367-65536-0029 HE SOLD THE FARM TO HIS COUSIN STEPHEN MARSHALL HE SUPPOSED IT STILL BELONGED TO HIM STEPHEN HAD BEEN A GOOD SORT OF A FELLOW A BIT SLOW AND PLODDING PERHAPS BOVINELY CONTENT TO DWELL WITHIN THE HILLS
6367-65536-0030 NEVER HEARKENING OR RESPONDING TO THE LURE OF THE BEYOND YET IT MIGHT BE HE HAD CHOSEN THE BETTER PART TO DWELL THUS ON THE LAND OF HIS FATHERS WITH A WIFE WON IN YOUTH AND CHILDREN TO GROW UP AROUND HIM
6367-65536-0031 THE CHILDLESS WIFELESS MAN LOOKING DOWN FROM THE HILL WONDERED IF IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SO WITH HIM HAD HE BEEN CONTENT TO STAY IN THE VALLEY PERHAPS SO THERE HAD BEEN JOYCE
6367-65536-0032 NOT SO FAR FROM HIS OWN JUST ACROSS A GREEN MEADOW BY WAY OF A FOOTPATH AND STILE AND THROUGH THE FIRS BEYOND IT HOW OFTEN HE HAD TRAVERSED THAT PATH IN THE OLD DAYS KNOWING THAT JOYCE WOULD BE WAITING AT THE END OF IT AMONG THE FIRS
6367-65536-0033 JOYCE THE PLAYMATE OF CHILDHOOD THE SWEET CONFIDANTE AND COMPANION OF YOUTH THEY HAD NEVER BEEN AVOWED LOVERS BUT HE HAD LOVED HER THEN AS A BOY LOVES ALTHOUGH HE HAD NEVER SAID A WORD OF LOVE TO HER
6367-65536-0034 JOYCE ALONE KNEW OF HIS LONGINGS AND HIS AMBITIONS AND HIS DREAMS HE HAD TOLD THEM ALL TO HER FREELY SURE OF THE UNDERSTANDING AND SYMPATHY NO OTHER SOUL IN THE VALLEY COULD GIVE HIM
6367-65536-0035 HOW TRUE AND STRONG AND WOMANLY AND GENTLE SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN WHEN HE LEFT HOME HE HAD MEANT TO GO BACK TO HER SOME DAY THEY HAD PARTED WITHOUT PLEDGE OR KISS YET HE KNEW SHE LOVED HIM AND THAT HE LOVED HER
6367-65536-0036 AT FIRST THEY CORRESPONDED THEN THE LETTERS BEGAN TO GROW FEWER IT WAS HIS FAULT HE HAD GRADUALLY FORGOTTEN THE NEW FIERCE BURNING INTERESTS THAT CAME INTO HIS LIFE CROWDED THE OLD ONES OUT
6367-65536-0037 BOYHOOD'S LOVE WAS SCORCHED UP IN THAT HOT FLAME OF AMBITION AND CONTEST HE HAD NOT HEARD FROM OR OF JOYCE FOR MANY YEARS NOW AGAIN HE REMEMBERED AS HE LOOKED DOWN ON THE HOMELAND FIELDS
6367-65536-0038 THE OLD PLACES HAD CHANGED LITTLE WHATEVER HE MIGHT FEAR OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THEM THERE WAS THE SCHOOL HE HAD ATTENDED A SMALL LOW EAVED WHITE WASHED BUILDING SET BACK FROM THE MAIN ROAD AMONG GREEN SPRUCES
6367-65536-0039 BEYOND IT AMID TALL ELMS WAS THE OLD CHURCH WITH ITS SQUARE TOWER HUNG WITH IVY HE FELT GLAD TO SEE IT HE HAD EXPECTED TO SEE A NEW CHURCH
6367-65536-0040 OFFENSIVELY SPICK AND SPAN AND MODERN FOR THIS CHURCH HAD BEEN OLD WHEN HE WAS A BOY HE RECALLED THE MANY TIMES HE HAD WALKED TO IT ON THE PEACEFUL SUNDAY AFTERNOONS SOMETIMES WITH HIS MOTHER SOMETIMES WITH JOYCE
6367-65536-0041 THE SUN SET FAR OUT TO SEA AND SUCKED DOWN WITH IT ALL THE LIGHT OUT OF THE WINNOWED DOME OF SKY THE STARS CAME OUT SINGLY AND CRYSTAL CLEAR OVER THE FAR PURPLE CURVES OF THE HILLS
6367-65536-0042 SUDDENLY GLANCING OVER HIS SHOULDER HE SAW THROUGH AN ARCH OF BLACK FIR BOUGHS A YOUNG MOON SWUNG LOW IN A LAKE OF PALELY TINTED SAFFRON SKY HE SMILED A LITTLE
6367-65536-0043 REMEMBERING THAT IN BOYHOOD IT HAD BEEN HELD A GOOD OMEN TO SEE THE NEW MOON OVER THE RIGHT SHOULDER DOWN IN THE VALLEY THE LIGHTS BEGAN TO TWINKLE OUT HERE AND THERE LIKE EARTH STARS
6367-65536-0044 HE WOULD WAIT UNTIL HE SAW THE KITCHEN LIGHT FROM THE WINDOW OF HIS OLD HOME THEN HE WOULD GO
6367-65536-0045 BUT NO LIGHT GLIMMERED OUT THROUGH HIS NATIVE TREES WHY WAS IT LACKING THAT LIGHT HE HAD SO OFTEN HAILED AT DARK COMING HOME FROM BOYISH RAMBLES ON THE HILLS
6367-65536-0046 HE FELT ANXIOUS AND DISSATISFIED AS IF HE COULD NOT GO AWAY UNTIL HE HAD SEEN IT WHEN IT WAS QUITE DARK HE DESCENDED THE HILL RESOLUTELY HE MUST KNOW WHY THE HOMELIGHT HAD FAILED HIM
6367-65536-0047 EVEN IN THE DIMNESS OF THE SUMMER NIGHT TO SEE THAT THE OLD HOUSE WAS DESERTED AND FALLING TO DECAY THE KITCHEN DOOR SWUNG OPEN ON RUSTY HINGES THE WINDOWS WERE BROKEN AND LIFELESS
6367-65536-0048 CUTHBERT MARSHALL SAT DOWN ON THE OLD RED SANDSTONE STEP OF THE DOOR AND BOWED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS THIS WAS WHAT HE HAD COME BACK TO THIS GHOST AND WRECK OF HIS PAST OH
6367-65536-0049 STEPHEN CAME TO IT A STOUT GRIZZLED FARMER WITH A CHUBBY BOY ON HIS SHOULDER HE WAS NOT MUCH CHANGED CUTHBERT EASILY RECOGNIZED HIM
6367-65536-0050 CUTHBERT WAS OBLIGED TO TELL WHO HE WAS HE WAS MADE INSTANTLY AND WARMLY WELCOME STEPHEN WAS UNFEIGNEDLY GLAD TO SEE HIM AND STEPHEN'S COMELY WIFE WHOM HE REMEMBERED AS A SLIM FRESH CHEEKED VALLEY GIRL
6367-65536-0051 HE AND STEPHEN TALKED LATE THAT NIGHT AND IN THE MORNING HE YIELDED TO THEIR ENTREATIES TO STAY ANOTHER DAY WITH THEM HE SPENT IT WANDERING ABOUT THE FARM AND THE OLD HAUNTS OF WOOD AND STREAM YET HE COULD NOT FIND HIMSELF
6367-65536-0052 THIS VALLEY HAD HIS PAST IN ITS KEEPING BUT IT COULD NOT GIVE IT BACK TO HIM HE HAD LOST THE MASTER WORD THAT MIGHT HAVE COMPELLED IT HE ASKED STEPHEN FULLY ABOUT ALL HIS OLD FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS WITH ONE EXCEPTION
6367-65536-0053 BY THE OLD FOOTPATH WHICH WAS STILL KEPT OPEN HE WALKED SLOWLY AND DREAMILY WITH HIS EYES ON THE FAR HILLS SCARFED IN THE SPLENDOUR OF SUNSET SO HE HAD WALKED IN THE OLD DAYS BUT HE HAD NO DREAMS NOW OF WHAT LAY BEYOND THE HILLS
6367-65536-0054 AND JOYCE WOULD NOT BE WAITING AMONG THE FIRS THE STILE HE REMEMBERED WAS GONE REPLACED BY A LITTLE RUSTIC GATE AS HE PASSED THROUGH IT HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND THERE BEFORE HIM
6367-65536-0055 AND THE SOUL OF HER LOOKED OUT THROUGH THEM TRUE TO ITSELF THE STAUNCH BRAVE SWEET SOUL OF THE MAIDEN RIPENED TO WOMANHOOD JOYCE HE SAID STUPIDLY UNBELIEVINGLY
6367-65536-0056 BUT HE TOOK BOTH AND HELD HER SO LOOKING HUNGRILY DOWN AT HER AS A MAN LOOKS AT SOMETHING HE KNOWS MUST BE HIS SALVATION IF SALVATION EXISTS FOR HIM IS IT POSSIBLE YOU ARE HERE STILL JOYCE
6367-65536-0057 HE SAID SLOWLY AND YOU HAVE NOT CHANGED AT ALL SHE COLOURED SLIGHTLY AND PULLED AWAY HER HANDS LAUGHING OH INDEED I HAVE I HAVE GROWN OLD
6367-65536-0058 THE TWILIGHT IS SO KIND IT HIDES THAT BUT IT IS TRUE COME INTO THE HOUSE CUTHBERT FATHER AND MOTHER WILL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU AFTER A LITTLE HE SAID IMPLORINGLY LET US STAY HERE AWHILE FIRST JOYCE
6367-65536-0059 LAST NIGHT I STOOD ON THOSE HILLS YONDER AND LOOKED DOWN BUT I MEANT TO GO AWAY BECAUSE I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE NO ONE LEFT TO WELCOME ME IF I HAD KNOWN YOU WERE HERE YOU HAVE LIVED HERE IN THE OLD VALLEY ALL THESE YEARS
6367-65536-0060 ALL THESE YEARS SHE SAID GENTLY I SUPPOSE YOU THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY MEAGRE LIFE NO I AM MUCH WISER NOW THAN I WAS ONCE JOYCE I HAVE LEARNED WISDOM BEYOND THE HILLS ONE LEARNS THERE
6367-65536-0061 IN TIME BUT SOMETIMES THE LESSON IS LEARNED TOO LATE SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT I HAVE LEARNED JOYCE THE GIST OF THE LESSON IS THAT I LEFT HAPPINESS BEHIND ME IN THE OLD VALLEY WHEN I WENT AWAY FROM IT HAPPINESS AND PEACE AND THE JOY OF LIVING
6367-65536-0062 I DID NOT MISS THESE THINGS FOR A LONG WHILE I DID NOT EVEN KNOW I HAD LOST THEM BUT I HAVE DISCOVERED MY LOSS YET YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL MAN SHE SAID WONDERINGLY
6367-65536-0063 AS THE WORLD CALLS SUCCESS HE ANSWERED BITTERLY I HAVE PLACE AND WEALTH AND POWER BUT THAT IS NOT SUCCESS JOYCE I AM TIRED OF THESE THINGS THEY ARE THE TOYS OF GROWN UP CHILDREN
6367-65536-0064 THEY DO NOT SATISFY THE MAN'S SOUL I HAVE COME BACK TO THE OLD VALLEY SEEKING FOR WHAT MIGHT SATISFY BUT I HAVE LITTLE HOPE OF FINDING IT UNLESS UNLESS HE WAS SILENT
6367-65536-0065 REMEMBERING THAT HE HAD FORFEITED ALL RIGHT TO HER HELP IN THE QUEST YET HE REALIZED CLEARLY THAT ONLY SHE COULD HELP HIM ONLY SHE COULD GUIDE HIM BACK TO THE PATH HE HAD MISSED IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT SHE HELD IN HER KEEPING
6367-65536-0066 ALL THE GOOD OF HIS LIFE ALL THE BEAUTY OF HIS PAST ALL THE POSSIBILITIES OF HIS FUTURE HERS WAS THE MASTER WORD BUT HOW SHOULD HE DARE ASK HER TO UTTER IT
6367-65536-0067 THEY WALKED AMONG THE FIRS UNTIL THE STARS CAME OUT AND THEY TALKED OF MANY THINGS SHE HAD KEPT HER FRESHNESS OF SOUL AND HER IDEALS UNTARNISHED IN THE PEACE OF THE OLD VALLEY SHE HAD LIVED A LIFE NARROW OUTWARDLY
6367-65536-0068 WONDROUSLY DEEP AND WIDE IN THOUGHT AND ASPIRATION HER NATIVE HILLS BOUNDED THE VISION OF HER EYES BUT THE OUTLOOK OF THE SOUL WAS FAR AND UNHINDERED
6367-65536-0069 IN THE QUIET PLACES AND THE GREEN WAYS SHE HAD FOUND WHAT HE HAD FAILED TO FIND THE SECRET OF HAPPINESS AND CONTENT HE KNEW THAT IF THIS WOMAN HAD WALKED HAND IN HAND WITH HIM THROUGH THE YEARS
6367-65536-0070 LIFE EVEN IN THE GLARE AND TUMULT OF THAT WORLD BEYOND THE HILLS WOULD NEVER HAVE LOST ITS MEANING FOR HIM OH FOOL AND BLIND THAT HE HAD BEEN WHILE HE HAD SOUGHT AND TOILED AFAR
6367-65536-0071 THE BEST THAT GOD HAD MEANT FOR HIM HAD BEEN HERE IN THE HOME OF YOUTH WHEN DARKNESS CAME DOWN THROUGH THE FIRS HE TOLD HER ALL THIS HALTINGLY BLUNDERINGLY YEARNINGLY JOYCE
6367-65536-0072 IS IT TOO LATE CAN YOU FORGIVE MY MISTAKE MY LONG BLINDNESS CAN YOU CARE FOR ME AGAIN A LITTLE SHE TURNED HER FACE UPWARD TO THE SKY BETWEEN THE SWAYING FIR TOPS
6367-65536-0073 AND HE SAW THE REFLECTION OF A STAR IN HER EYES I HAVE NEVER CEASED TO CARE SHE SAID IN A LOW TONE I NEVER REALLY WANTED TO CEASE IT WOULD HAVE LEFT LIFE TOO EMPTY IF MY LOVE MEANS SO MUCH TO YOU
6367-65536-0074 IT IS YOURS CUTHBERT IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN YOURS HE DREW HER CLOSE INTO HIS ARMS AND AS HE FELT HER HEART BEATING AGAINST HIS HE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD FOUND THE WAY BACK TO SIMPLE HAPPINESS AND TRUE WISDOM
6367-74004-0000 RUGGLES AND I WERE DOWN ON THE OLD FELLOW IT DOESN'T MATTER WHY AND SINCE IN A STORY OF THIS KIND WE MUST TELL THE TRUTH NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS OR ELSE WHERE IS THE USE OF WRITING A STORY AT ALL
6367-74004-0001 HE IS PRINCIPAL OF THE FRAMPTON ACADEMY THE OLD FELLOW NOT RUGGLES AND HIS NAME IS GEORGE OSBORNE WE HAVE TO CALL HIM MISTER OSBORNE TO HIS FACE BUT HE IS THE OLD FELLOW EVERYWHERE ELSE
6367-74004-0002 BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE POINT THEY LIKE HIM TOO I HEARD EMMA WHITE SAY ONCE THAT HE WAS SO HANDSOME I NEARLY WHOOPED RUGGLES WAS MAD BECAUSE HE'S GONE ON EM
6367-74004-0003 HE IS SPLENDID BIG SIX FOOTER WITH MAGNIFICENT MUSCLES RED CHEEKS AND CURLY YELLOW HAIR I CAN'T SEE HOW HE CAN BE CONTENTED TO SIT DOWN AND TEACH MUSHY ENGLISH LITERATURE AND POETRY AND THAT SORT OF THING
6367-74004-0004 THERE WAS A RUMOUR RUNNING AT LARGE IN THE ACADEMY THAT THE OLD FELLOW WROTE POETRY BUT HE RAN THE MATHEMATICS AND DIDN'T MAKE SUCH A FOOZLE OF IT AS YOU MIGHT SUPPOSE EITHER
6367-74004-0005 AT LEAST WE SAID SO BUT IF PROVIDENCE HADN'T SENT SYLVIA GRANT WALKING DOWN THE STREET PAST OUR BOARDING HOUSE THAT AFTERNOON WE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE COOLED OFF BEFORE WE THOUGHT OF ANY WORKING PLAN OF REVENGE SYLVIA GRANT DID GO DOWN THE STREET HOWEVER
6367-74004-0006 RUGGLES HANGING HALFWAY OUT OF THE WINDOW AS USUAL SAW HER AND CALLED ME TO GO AND LOOK OF COURSE I WENT SYLVIA GRANT WAS ALWAYS WORTH LOOKING AT THERE WAS NO GIRL IN FRAMPTON WHO COULD HOLD A CANDLE TO HER WHEN IT CAME TO BEAUTY
6367-74004-0007 MY PRIVATE OPINION IS THAT SYLVIA HADN'T ANY OR SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE PREFERRED BUT THERE I'M GETTING ON TOO FAST AGAIN RUGGLES SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN THIS STORY HE CAN CONCENTRATE BETTER SYLVIA WAS THE LATIN PROFESSOR'S DAUGHTER
6367-74004-0008 SHE WASN'T A CAD GIRL OF COURSE SHE WAS OVER TWENTY AND HAD GRADUATED FROM IT TWO YEARS AGO BUT SHE WAS IN ALL THE SOCIAL THINGS THAT WENT ON IN THE ACADEMY AND ALL THE UNMARRIED PROFESSORS EXCEPT THE OLD FELLOW WERE IN LOVE WITH HER
6367-74004-0009 MICKY HAD IT THE WORST AND WE HAD ALL MADE UP OUR MINDS THAT SYLVIA WOULD MARRY MICKY HE WAS SO HANDSOME WE DIDN'T SEE HOW SHE COULD HELP IT I TELL YOU THEY MADE A DANDY LOOKING COUPLE WHEN THEY WERE TOGETHER WELL AS I SAID BEFORE I TODDLED TO THE WINDOW TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE FAIR SYLVIA
6367-74004-0010 THEY WERE BROWNISH KIND OF AND SHE'D A SPANKING HAT ON WITH FEATHERS AND THINGS IN IT HER HAIR WAS SHINING UNDER IT ALL PURPLY BLACK AND SHE LOOKED SWEET ENOUGH TO EAT
6367-74004-0011 AND HER BIG BLACKISH BLUE EYES SPARKLED BUT SHE HADN'T BEEN LAUGHING BEFORE OR SPARKLING EITHER
6367-74004-0012 I RATHER SUSPECTED IT FOR AT THE SENIOR PROM THREE NIGHTS BEFORE SHE HAD HARDLY LOOKED AT MICKY BUT HAD SAT IN A CORNER AND TALKED TO THE OLD FELLOW HE DIDN'T DO MUCH TALKING HE WAS TOO SHY AND HE LOOKED MIGHTY UNCOMFORTABLE
6367-74004-0013 BUT WHEN I SAW MICKY SCOWLING AT THE CORNER I KNEW SHE WAS DOING IT TO MAKE HIM JEALOUS GIRLS WON'T STICK AT ANYTHING WHEN THEY WANT TO PROVOKE A CHAP I KNOW IT TO MY COST FOR JENNIE PRICE
6367-74004-0014 HE CAUGHT SYLVIA DOING THE SAME THING SO HE WHEELED AND CAME ON LOOKING MIGHTY FOOLISH AS HE PASSED BENEATH OUR WINDOW RUGGLES CHUCKLED FIENDISHLY I'VE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING POLLY HE SAID MY NAME IS PAUL
6367-74004-0015 LET'S WRITE A LETTER TO SYLVIA GRANT A LOVE LETTER AND SIGN THE OLD FELLOW'S NAME TO IT SHE'LL GIVE HIM A FEARFUL SNUBBING AND WE'LL BE REVENGED BUT WHO'LL WRITE IT I SAID DOUBTFULLY I CAN'T
6367-74004-0016 YOU'LL HAVE TO RUGGLES YOU'VE HAD MORE PRACTICE RUGGLES TURNED RED I KNOW HE WRITES TO EM WHITE IN VACATIONS I'LL DO MY BEST HE SAID QUITE MEEKLY THAT IS I'LL COMPOSE IT BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO COPY IT
6367-74004-0017 YOU CAN IMITATE THE OLD FELLOW'S HANDWRITING SO WELL BUT LOOK HERE I SAID AN UNCOMFORTABLE IDEA STRIKING ME WHAT ABOUT SYLVIA WON'T SHE FEEL KIND OF FLATTISH WHEN SHE FINDS OUT HE DIDN'T WRITE IT FOR OF COURSE HE'LL TELL HER
6367-74004-0018 SHE DOESN'T LIKE THE OLD FELLOW A BIT I KNOW FROM THE WAY SHE ACTS WITH HIM SHE'S ALWAYS SO COOL AND STIFF WHEN HE'S ABOUT NOT A BIT LIKE SHE IS WITH THE OTHER PROFESSORS WELL RUGGLES WROTE THE LETTER AT FIRST HE TRIED TO PASS IT OFF ON ME AS HIS OWN COMPOSITION
6367-74004-0019 BUT I KNOW A FEW LITTLE THINGS AND ONE OF THEM IS THAT RUGGLES COULDN'T HAVE MADE UP THAT LETTER ANY MORE THAN HE COULD HAVE WRITTEN A SONNET I TOLD HIM SO AND MADE HIM OWN UP HE HAD A COPY OF AN OLD LETTER THAT HAD BEEN WRITTEN TO HIS SISTER BY HER YOUNG MAN
6367-74004-0020 ANYHOW THAT LETTER JUST FILLED THE BILL IT WAS BEAUTIFULLY EXPRESSED RUGGLES'S SISTER'S YOUNG MAN MUST HAVE POSSESSED LOTS OF ABILITY HE WAS AN ENGLISH PROFESSOR SOMETHING LIKE MICKY
6367-74004-0021 HE STARTED IN BY TELLING HER HOW MUCH HE LOVED HER AND WHAT AN ANGEL OF BEAUTY AND GOODNESS HE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT HER HOW UNWORTHY HE FELT HIMSELF OF HER AND HOW LITTLE HOPE HE HAD THAT SHE COULD EVER CARE FOR HIM
6367-74004-0022 AND HE WOUND UP BY IMPLORING HER TO TELL HIM IF SHE COULD POSSIBLY LOVE HIM A LITTLE BIT AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING I COPIED THE LETTER OUT ON HELIOTROPE PAPER IN MY BEST IMITATION OF THE OLD FELLOW'S HANDWRITING AND SIGNED IT YOURS DEVOTEDLY AND IMPLORINGLY
6367-74004-0023 GEORGE OSBORNE THEN WE MAILED IT THAT VERY EVENING
6367-74004-0024 IT WAS THE SMARTEST EVENT OF THE TERM AND EVERYBODY WAS THERE STUDENTS AND FACULTY AND OF COURSE SYLVIA GRANT SYLVIA LOOKED STUNNING
6367-74004-0025 AND AVOIDED POOR MICKY SO SKILFULLY THAT IT WAS REALLY A PLEASURE TO WATCH HER THE OLD FELLOW CAME IN LATE WITH HIS TIE ALL CROOKED AS IT ALWAYS WAS I SAW SYLVIA BLUSH AND NUDGED RUGGLES TO LOOK SHE'S THINKING OF THE LETTER HE SAID
6367-74004-0026 RUGGLES AND I NEVER MEANT TO LISTEN UPON MY WORD WE DIDN'T IT WAS PURE ACCIDENT WE WERE IN BEHIND THE FLAGS AND PALMS IN THE MODERN LANGUAGES ROOM FIXING UP A PLAN HOW TO GET EM AND JENNIE OFF FOR A MOONLIT STROLL IN THE GROUNDS
6367-74004-0027 SYLVIA STILL LOOKED SMILING AND HAPPY NOT A BIT MAD AS WE HAD EXPECTED BUT JUST KIND OF SHY AND RADIANT AS FOR THE OLD FELLOW HE LOOKED AS EM WHITE WOULD SAY AS SPHINX LIKE AS EVER
6367-74004-0028 OR SAID MY LETTER OR SHOWN SURPRISE IN SOME WAY
6367-74004-0029 HE LOOKED SIDEWAYS AT SYLVIA FOR A MOMENT AND THEN HE SAID KIND OF DRILY AH DID YOU YES SAID SYLVIA NOT MUCH ABOVE A WHISPER IT IT SURPRISED ME VERY MUCH I NEVER SUPPOSED THAT YOU
6367-74004-0030 HIS VOICE ACTUALLY TREMBLED I I DON'T THINK I WOULD TELL YOU IF I KNEW SAID SYLVIA TURNING HER HEAD AWAY YOU SEE I DON'T WANT YOU TO HELP CARING SYLVIA
6367-74004-0031 YOU NEVER SAW SUCH A TRANSFORMATION AS CAME OVER THE OLD FELLOW HIS EYES JUST BLAZED BUT HIS FACE WENT WHITE HE BENT FORWARD AND TOOK HER HAND SYLVIA
6367-74004-0032 DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU YOU ACTUALLY CARE A LITTLE FOR ME DEAREST OH SYLVIA DO YOU MEAN THAT OF COURSE I DO SAID SYLVIA RIGHT OUT
6367-74004-0033 I'VE ALWAYS CARED EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL COMING HERE TO SCHOOL AND BREAKING MY HEART OVER MATHEMATICS ALTHOUGH I HATED THEM JUST TO BE IN YOUR CLASS WHY WHY
6367-74004-0034 I THOUGHT IT QUITE USELESS TO TELL YOU OF MY LOVE BEFORE WILL YOU CAN YOU BE MY WIFE DARLING AT THIS POINT RUGGLES AND I DIFFER AS TO WHAT CAME NEXT
6367-74004-0035 HE ASSERTS THAT SYLVIA TURNED SQUARE AROUND AND KISSED THE OLD FELLOW BUT I'M SURE SHE JUST TURNED HER FACE AND GAVE HIM A LOOK AND THEN HE KISSED HER ANYHOW
6367-74004-0036 THERE THEY BOTH WERE GOING ON AT THE SILLIEST RATE ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY LOVED EACH OTHER AND HOW THE OLD FELLOW THOUGHT SHE LOVED MICKY AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING IT WAS AWFUL I NEVER THOUGHT THE OLD FELLOW OR SYLVIA EITHER COULD BE SO SPOONEY
6367-74004-0037 RUGGLES AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING ON EARTH TO BE OUT OF THAT WE KNEW WE'D NO BUSINESS TO BE THERE AND WE FELT AS FOOLISH AS FLATFISH IT WAS A TREMENDOUS RELIEF WHEN THE OLD FELLOW AND SYLVIA GOT UP AT LAST AND TRAILED AWAY BOTH OF THEM LOOKING IDIOTICALLY HAPPY
6437-66172-0000 IN THE COURSE OF TEN DAYS I RECOVERED SUFFICIENTLY FROM MY INJURIES TO ATTEND SCHOOL WHERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE I WAS LOOKED UPON AS A HERO ON ACCOUNT OF HAVING BEEN BLOWN UP WHAT DON'T WE MAKE A HERO OF
6437-66172-0001 THE DISTRACTION WHICH PREVAILED IN THE CLASSES THE WEEK PRECEDING THE FOURTH HAD SUBSIDED AND NOTHING REMAINED TO INDICATE THE RECENT FESTIVITIES EXCEPTING A NOTICEABLE WANT OF EYEBROWS ON THE PART OF PEPPER WHITCOMB AND MYSELF
6437-66172-0002 IN AUGUST WE HAD TWO WEEKS VACATION IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME THAT I BECAME A MEMBER OF THE RIVERMOUTH CENTIPEDES A SECRET SOCIETY COMPOSED OF TWELVE OF THE TEMPLE GRAMMAR SCHOOL BOYS
6437-66172-0003 THIS WAS AN HONOR TO WHICH I HAD LONG ASPIRED BUT BEING A NEW BOY I WAS NOT ADMITTED TO THE FRATERNITY UNTIL MY CHARACTER HAD FULLY DEVELOPED ITSELF IT WAS A VERY SELECT SOCIETY THE OBJECT OF WHICH I NEVER FATHOMED
6437-66172-0004 THOUGH I WAS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE BODY DURING THE REMAINDER OF MY RESIDENCE AT RIVERMOUTH AND AT ONE TIME HELD THE ONEROUS POSITION OF F C FIRST CENTIPEDE EACH OF THE ELECT WORE A COPPER CENT
6437-66172-0005 SOME OCCULT ASSOCIATION BEING ESTABLISHED BETWEEN A CENT APIECE AND A CENTIPEDES SUSPENDED BY A STRING ROUND HIS NECK THE MEDALS WERE WORN NEXT THE SKIN AND IT WAS WHILE BATHING ONE DAY AT GRAVE POINT WITH JACK HARRIS AND FRED LANGDON
6437-66172-0006 THAT I HAD MY CURIOSITY ROUSED TO THE HIGHEST PITCH BY A SIGHT OF THESE SINGULAR EMBLEMS AS SOON AS I ASCERTAINED THE EXISTENCE OF A BOYS CLUB OF COURSE I WAS READY TO DIE TO JOIN IT AND EVENTUALLY I WAS ALLOWED TO JOIN
6437-66172-0007 THE INITIATION CEREMONY TOOK PLACE IN FRED LANGDON'S BARN WHERE I WAS SUBMITTED TO A SERIES OF TRIALS NOT CALCULATED TO SOOTHE THE NERVES OF A TIMOROUS BOY BEFORE BEING LED TO THE GROTTO OF ENCHANTMENT
6437-66172-0008 SUCH WAS THE MODEST TITLE GIVEN TO THE LOFT OVER MY FRIEND'S WOOD HOUSE MY HANDS WERE SECURELY PINIONED AND MY EYES COVERED WITH A THICK SILK HANDKERCHIEF AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS I WAS TOLD IN AN UNRECOGNIZABLE HUSKY VOICE
6437-66172-0009 IF I FELT MYSELF PHYSICALLY TOO WEAK TO UNDERGO THE NECESSARY TORTURES I REPLIED THAT I WAS NOT TOO WEAK IN A TONE WHICH I INTENDED TO BE RESOLUTE BUT WHICH IN SPITE OF ME SEEMED TO COME FROM THE PIT OF MY STOMACH IT IS WELL
6437-66172-0010 A PROLONGED SILENCE FOLLOWED THIS PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION AND I WAS WONDERING WHAT WOULD COME NEXT
6437-66172-0011 THE UNKNOWN VOICE THEN DIRECTED ME TO TAKE TEN STEPS FORWARD AND STOP AT THE WORD HALT I TOOK TEN STEPS AND HALTED STRICKEN MORTAL SAID A SECOND HUSKY VOICE MORE HUSKY IF POSSIBLE THAN THE FIRST
6437-66172-0012 IF YOU HAD ADVANCED ANOTHER INCH YOU WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED DOWN AN ABYSS THREE THOUSAND FEET DEEP I NATURALLY SHRUNK BACK AT THIS FRIENDLY PIECE OF INFORMATION A PRICK FROM SOME TWO PRONGED INSTRUMENT EVIDENTLY A PITCHFORK
6437-66172-0013 GENTLY CHECKED MY RETREAT I WAS THEN CONDUCTED TO THE BRINK OF SEVERAL OTHER PRECIPICES AND ORDERED TO STEP OVER MANY DANGEROUS CHASMS WHERE THE RESULT WOULD HAVE BEEN INSTANT DEATH IF I HAD COMMITTED THE LEAST MISTAKE
6437-66172-0014 I HAVE NEGLECTED TO SAY THAT MY MOVEMENTS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY DISMAL GROANS FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE GROTTO FINALLY I WAS LED UP A STEEP PLANK TO WHAT APPEARED TO ME AN INCALCULABLE HEIGHT
6437-66172-0015 A SECOND PISTOL SHOT WAS HEARD THE SOMETHING I STOOD ON SUNK WITH A CRASH BENEATH MY FEET AND I FELL TWO MILES AS NEARLY AS I COULD COMPUTE IT AT THE SAME INSTANT THE HANDKERCHIEF WAS WHISKED FROM MY EYES AND I FOUND MYSELF STANDING IN AN EMPTY HOGSHEAD
6437-66172-0016 SURROUNDED BY TWELVE MASKED FIGURES FANTASTICALLY DRESSED ONE OF THE CONSPIRATORS WAS REALLY APPALLING WITH A TIN SAUCE PAN ON HIS HEAD AND A TIGER SKIN SLEIGH ROBE THROWN OVER HIS SHOULDERS I SCARCELY NEED SAY
6437-66172-0017 THAT THERE WERE NO VESTIGES TO BE SEEN OF THE FEARFUL GULFS OVER WHICH I HAD PASSED SO CAUTIOUSLY MY ASCENT HAD BEEN TO THE TOP OF THE HOGSHEAD AND MY DESCENT TO THE BOTTOM THEREOF HOLDING ONE ANOTHER BY THE HAND AND CHANTING A LOW DIRGE
6437-66172-0018 THE MYSTIC TWELVE REVOLVED ABOUT ME THIS CONCLUDED THE CEREMONY WITH A MERRY SHOUT THE BOYS THREW OFF THEIR MASKS AND I WAS DECLARED A REGULARLY INSTALLED MEMBER OF THE R M C
6437-66172-0019 I AFTERWARDS HAD A GOOD DEAL OF SPORT OUT OF THE CLUB FOR THESE INITIATIONS AS YOU MAY IMAGINE WERE SOMETIMES VERY COMICAL SPECTACLES ESPECIALLY WHEN THE ASPIRANT FOR CENTIPEDAL HONORS HAPPENED TO BE OF A TIMID DISPOSITION
6437-66172-0020 IF HE SHOWED THE SLIGHTEST TERROR HE WAS CERTAIN TO BE TRICKED UNMERCIFULLY ONE OF OUR SUBSEQUENT DEVICES A HUMBLE INVENTION OF MY OWN WAS TO REQUEST THE BLINDFOLDED CANDIDATE TO PUT OUT HIS TONGUE WHEREUPON THE FIRST CENTIPEDE WOULD SAY
6437-66172-0021 IN A LOW TONE AS IF NOT INTENDED FOR THE EAR OF THE VICTIM DIABOLUS FETCH ME THE RED HOT IRON THE EXPEDITION WITH WHICH THAT TONGUE WOULD DISAPPEAR WAS SIMPLY RIDICULOUS
6437-66172-0022 OUR MEETINGS WERE HELD IN VARIOUS BARNS AT NO STATED PERIODS BUT AS CIRCUMSTANCES SUGGESTED ANY MEMBER HAD A RIGHT TO CALL A MEETING EACH BOY WHO FAILED TO REPORT HIMSELF WAS FINED ONE CENT
6437-66172-0023 WHENEVER A MEMBER HAD REASONS FOR THINKING THAT ANOTHER MEMBER WOULD BE UNABLE TO ATTEND HE CALLED A MEETING FOR INSTANCE IMMEDIATELY ON LEARNING THE DEATH OF HARRY BLAKE'S GREAT GRANDFATHER I ISSUED A CALL
6437-66172-0024 BY THESE SIMPLE AND INGENIOUS MEASURES WE KEPT OUR TREASURY IN A FLOURISHING CONDITION SOMETIMES HAVING ON HAND AS MUCH AS A DOLLAR AND A QUARTER I HAVE SAID THAT THE SOCIETY HAD NO SPECIAL OBJECT IT IS TRUE THERE WAS A TACIT UNDERSTANDING AMONG US
6437-66172-0025 THAT THE CENTIPEDES WERE TO STAND BY ONE ANOTHER ON ALL OCCASIONS THOUGH I DON'T REMEMBER THAT THEY DID BUT FURTHER THAN THIS WE HAD NO PURPOSE UNLESS IT WAS TO ACCOMPLISH AS A BODY THE SAME AMOUNT OF MISCHIEF WHICH WE WERE SURE TO DO AS INDIVIDUALS
6437-66172-0026 TO MYSTIFY THE STAID AND SLOW GOING RIVERMOUTHIANS WAS OUR FREQUENT PLEASURE SEVERAL OF OUR PRANKS WON US SUCH A REPUTATION AMONG THE TOWNSFOLK THAT WE WERE CREDITED WITH HAVING A LARGE FINGER IN WHATEVER WENT AMISS IN THE PLACE ONE MORNING
6437-66172-0027 ABOUT A WEEK AFTER MY ADMISSION INTO THE SECRET ORDER THE QUIET CITIZENS AWOKE TO FIND THAT THE SIGNBOARDS OF ALL THE PRINCIPAL STREETS HAD CHANGED PLACES DURING THE NIGHT PEOPLE WHO WENT TRUSTFULLY TO SLEEP IN CURRANT SQUARE OPENED THEIR EYES IN HONEYSUCKLE TERRACE
6437-66172-0028 JONES'S AVENUE AT THE NORTH END HAD SUDDENLY BECOME WALNUT STREET AND PEANUT STREET WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND CONFUSION REIGNED THE TOWN AUTHORITIES TOOK THE MATTER IN HAND WITHOUT DELAY
6437-66172-0029 AND SIX OF THE TEMPLE GRAMMAR SCHOOL BOYS WERE SUMMONED TO APPEAR BEFORE JUSTICE CLAPBAM HAVING TEARFULLY DISCLAIMED TO MY GRANDFATHER ALL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRANSACTION I DISAPPEARED FROM THE FAMILY CIRCLE AND WAS NOT APPREHENDED UNTIL LATE IN THE AFTERNOON
6437-66172-0030 WHEN THE CAPTAIN DRAGGED ME IGNOMINIOUSLY FROM THE HAYMOW AND CONDUCTED ME MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE TO THE OFFICE OF JUSTICE CLAPHAM HERE I ENCOUNTERED FIVE OTHER PALLID CULPRITS WHO HAD BEEN FISHED OUT OF DIVERS COAL BINS GARRETS AND CHICKEN COOPS
6437-66172-0031 TO ANSWER THE DEMANDS OF THE OUTRAGED LAWS CHARLEY MARDEN HAD HIDDEN HIMSELF IN A PILE OF GRAVEL BEHIND HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND LOOKED LIKE A RECENTLY EXHUMED MUMMY THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST EVIDENCE AGAINST US AND INDEED WE WERE WHOLLY INNOCENT OF THE OFFENCE
6437-66172-0032 THE TRICK AS WAS AFTERWARDS PROVED HAD BEEN PLAYED BY A PARTY OF SOLDIERS STATIONED AT THE FORT IN THE HARBOR WE WERE INDEBTED FOR OUR ARREST TO MASTER CONWAY WHO HAD SLYLY DROPPED A HINT WITHIN THE HEARING OF SELECTMAN MUDGE TO THE EFFECT THAT
6437-66172-0033 YOUNG BAILEY AND HIS FIVE CRONIES COULD TELL SOMETHING ABOUT THEM SIGNS WHEN HE WAS CALLED UPON TO MAKE GOOD HIS ASSERTION HE WAS CONSIDERABLY MORE TERRIFIED THAN THE CENTIPEDES THOUGH THEY WERE READY TO SINK INTO THEIR SHOES AT OUR NEXT MEETING
6437-66172-0034 IT WAS UNANIMOUSLY RESOLVED THAT CONWAY'S ANIMOSITY SHOULD NOT BE QUIETLY SUBMITTED TO HE HAD SOUGHT TO INFORM AGAINST US IN THE STAGECOACH BUSINESS HE HAD VOLUNTEERED TO CARRY PETTINGIL'S LITTLE BILL FOR TWENTY FOUR ICECREAMS TO CHARLEY MARDEN'S FATHER
6437-66172-0035 AND NOW HE HAD CAUSED US TO BE ARRAIGNED BEFORE JUSTICE CLAPHAM ON A CHARGE EQUALLY GROUNDLESS AND PAINFUL AFTER MUCH NOISY DISCUSSION A PLAN OF RETALIATION WAS AGREED UPON
6437-66172-0036 THERE WAS A CERTAIN SLIM MILD APOTHECARY IN THE TOWN BY THE NAME OF MEEKS IT WAS GENERALLY GIVEN OUT THAT MISTER MEEKS HAD A VAGUE DESIRE TO GET MARRIED BUT BEING A SHY AND TIMOROUS YOUTH LACKED THE MORAL COURAGE TO DO SO
6437-66172-0037 IT WAS ALSO WELL KNOWN THAT THE WIDOW CONWAY HAD NOT BURIED HER HEART WITH THE LATE LAMENTED AS TO HER SHYNESS THAT WAS NOT SO CLEAR INDEED HER ATTENTIONS TO MISTER MEEKS WHOSE MOTHER SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
6437-66172-0038 WERE OF A NATURE NOT TO BE MISUNDERSTOOD AND WERE NOT MISUNDERSTOOD BY ANYONE BUT MISTER MEEKS HIMSELF THE WIDOW CARRIED ON A DRESS MAKING ESTABLISHMENT AT HER RESIDENCE ON THE CORNER OPPOSITE MEEKS'S DRUG STORE
6437-66172-0039 CASTING DESTRUCTIVE GLANCES ACROSS THE STREET THE ARTIFICIAL ROSES IN HER CAP AND HER WHOLE LANGUISHING MANNER SAYING AS PLAINLY AS A LABEL ON A PRESCRIPTION TO BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY BUT MISTER MEEKS DIDN'T TAKE
6437-66172-0040 THE LADY'S FONDNESS AND THE GENTLEMAN'S BLINDNESS WERE TOPICS ABLY HANDLED AT EVERY SEWING CIRCLE IN THE TOWN IT WAS THROUGH THESE TWO LUCKLESS INDIVIDUALS THAT WE PROPOSED TO STRIKE A BLOW AT THE COMMON ENEMY
6437-66172-0041 TO KILL LESS THAN THREE BIRDS WITH ONE STONE DID NOT SUIT OUR SANGUINARY PURPOSE WE DISLIKED THE WIDOW NOT SO MUCH FOR HER SENTIMENTALITY AS FOR BEING THE MOTHER OF BILL CONWAY WE DISLIKED MISTER MEEKS NOT BECAUSE HE WAS INSIPID
6437-66172-0042 LIKE HIS OWN SYRUPS BUT BECAUSE THE WIDOW LOVED HIM BILL CONWAY WE HATED FOR HIMSELF LATE ONE DARK SATURDAY NIGHT IN SEPTEMBER WE CARRIED OUR PLAN INTO EFFECT
6437-66172-0043 ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING AS THE ORDERLY CITIZENS WENDED THEIR WAY TO CHURCH PAST THE WIDOW'S ABODE THEIR SOBER FACES RELAXED AT BEHOLDING OVER HER FRONT DOOR THE WELL KNOWN GILT MORTAR AND PESTLE WHICH USUALLY STOOD ON THE TOP OF A POLE ON THE OPPOSITE CORNER
6437-66172-0044 WAS RECOGNIZED AT ONCE IT SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE OVER THE TOWN AND THOUGH THE MORTAR AND THE PLACARD WERE SPEEDILY REMOVED OUR TRIUMPH WAS COMPLETE THE WHOLE COMMUNITY WAS ON THE BROAD GRIN AND OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE AFFAIR SEEMINGLY UNSUSPECTED
6437-66173-0000 CHAPTER TEN I FIGHT CONWAY THERE WAS ONE PERSON HOWEVER WHO CHERISHED A STRONG SUSPICION THAT THE CENTIPEDES HAD HAD A HAND IN THE BUSINESS AND THAT PERSON WAS CONWAY
6437-66173-0001 HIS RED HAIR SEEMED TO CHANGE TO A LIVELIER RED AND HIS SALLOW CHEEKS TO A DEEPER SALLOW AS WE GLANCED AT HIM STEALTHILY OVER THE TOPS OF OUR SLATES THE NEXT DAY IN SCHOOL HE KNEW WE WERE WATCHING HIM AND MADE SUNDRY MOUTHS
6437-66173-0002 AND SCOWLED IN THE MOST THREATENING WAY OVER HIS SUMS CONWAY HAD AN ACCOMPLISHMENT PECULIARLY HIS OWN THAT OF THROWING HIS THUMBS OUT OF JOINT AT WILL SOMETIMES WHILE ABSORBED IN STUDY OR ON BECOMING NERVOUS AT RECITATION
6437-66173-0003 HE PERFORMED THE FEAT UNCONSCIOUSLY THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE MORNING HIS THUMBS WERE OBSERVED TO BE IN A CHRONIC STATE OF DISLOCATION INDICATING GREAT MENTAL AGITATION ON THE PART OF THE OWNER WE FULLY EXPECTED AN OUTBREAK FROM HIM AT RECESS
6437-66173-0004 BUT THE INTERMISSION PASSED OFF TRANQUILLY SOMEWHAT TO OUR DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE CLOSE OF THE AFTERNOON SESSION IT HAPPENED THAT BINNY WALLACE AND MYSELF HAVING GOT SWAMPED IN OUR LATIN EXERCISE
6437-66173-0005 WERE DETAINED IN SCHOOL FOR THE PURPOSE OF REFRESHING OUR MEMORIES WITH A PAGE OF MISTER ANDREWS'S PERPLEXING IRREGULAR VERBS BINNY WALLACE FINISHING HIS TASK FIRST WAS DISMISSED I FOLLOWED SHORTLY AFTER
6437-66173-0006 AND ON STEPPING INTO THE PLAYGROUND SAW MY LITTLE FRIEND PLASTERED AS IT WERE UP AGAINST THE FENCE AND CONWAY STANDING IN FRONT OF HIM READY TO DELIVER A BLOW ON THE UPTURNED UNPROTECTED FACE WHOSE GENTLENESS WOULD HAVE STAYED ANY ARM BUT A COWARD'S
6437-66173-0007 BUT ON SEEING ME SWEEP ACROSS THE YARD WHIRLING MY STRAP OF BOOKS IN THE AIR LIKE A SLING HE CALLED OUT LUSTILY LAY LOW CONWAY HERE'S YOUNG BAILEY CONWAY TURNED JUST IN TIME TO CATCH ON HIS SHOULDER THE BLOW INTENDED FOR HIS HEAD
6437-66173-0008 HE REACHED FORWARD ONE OF HIS LONG ARMS HE HAD ARMS LIKE A WINDMILL THAT BOY AND GRASPING ME BY THE HAIR TORE OUT QUITE A RESPECTABLE HANDFUL THE TEARS FLEW TO MY EYES
6437-66173-0009 BUT THEY WERE NOT THE TEARS OF DEFEAT THEY WERE MERELY THE INVOLUNTARY TRIBUTE WHICH NATURE PAID TO THE DEPARTED TRESSES IN A SECOND MY LITTLE JACKET LAY ON THE GROUND AND I STOOD ON GUARD RESTING LIGHTLY ON MY RIGHT LEG
6437-66173-0010 AND KEEPING MY EYE FIXED STEADILY ON CONWAY'S IN ALL OF WHICH I WAS FAITHFULLY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS OF PHIL ADAMS WHOSE FATHER SUBSCRIBED TO A SPORTING JOURNAL CONWAY ALSO THREW HIMSELF INTO A DEFENSIVE ATTITUDE
6437-66173-0011 AND THERE WE WERE GLARING AT EACH OTHER MOTIONLESS NEITHER OF US DISPOSED TO RISK AN ATTACK BUT BOTH ON THE ALERT TO RESIST ONE THERE IS NO TELLING HOW LONG WE MIGHT HAVE REMAINED IN THAT ABSURD POSITION HAD WE NOT BEEN INTERRUPTED
6437-66173-0012 IT WAS A CUSTOM WITH THE LARGER PUPILS TO RETURN TO THE PLAYGROUND AFTER SCHOOL AND PLAY BASEBALL UNTIL SUNDOWN THE TOWN AUTHORITIES HAD PROHIBITED BALL PLAYING ON THE SQUARE AND THERE BEING NO OTHER AVAILABLE PLACE
6437-66173-0013 THE BOYS FELL BACK PERFORCE ON THE SCHOOL YARD JUST AT THIS CRISIS A DOZEN OR SO OF THE TEMPLARS ENTERED THE GATE AND SEEING AT A GLANCE THE BELLIGERENT STATUS OF CONWAY AND MYSELF DROPPED BAT AND BALL AND RUSHED TO THE SPOT WHERE WE STOOD
6437-66173-0014 IS IT A FIGHT ASKED PHIL ADAMS WHO SAW BY OUR FRESHNESS THAT WE HAD NOT YET GOT TO WORK YES IT'S A FIGHT I ANSWERED UNLESS CONWAY WILL ASK WALLACE'S PARDON PROMISE NEVER TO HECTOR ME IN FUTURE
6437-66173-0015 AND PUT BACK MY HAIR THIS LAST CONDITION WAS RATHER A STAGGERER I SHA'N'T DO NOTHING OF THE SORT SAID CONWAY SULKILY THEN THE THING MUST GO ON SAID ADAMS WITH DIGNITY
6437-66173-0016 RODGERS AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS YOUR SECOND CONWAY BAILEY COME HERE WHAT'S THE ROW ABOUT HE WAS THRASHING BINNY WALLACE NO I WASN'T INTERRUPTED CONWAY
6437-66173-0017 BUT I WAS GOING TO BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHO PUT MEEKS'S MORTAR OVER OUR DOOR AND I KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHO DID IT IT WAS THAT SNEAKING LITTLE MULATTER POINTING AT ME O BY GEORGE I CRIED REDDENING AT THE INSULT
6437-66173-0018 COOL IS THE WORD SAID ADAMS AS HE BOUND A HANDKERCHIEF ROUND MY HEAD AND CAREFULLY TUCKED AWAY THE LONG STRAGGLING LOCKS THAT OFFERED A TEMPTING ADVANTAGE TO THE ENEMY WHO EVER HEARD OF A FELLOW WITH SUCH A HEAD OF HAIR GOING INTO ACTION
6437-66173-0019 MUTTERED PHIL TWITCHING THE HANDKERCHIEF TO ASCERTAIN IF IT WERE SECURELY TIED HE THEN LOOSENED MY GALLOWSES BRACES AND BUCKLED THEM TIGHTLY ABOVE MY HIPS NOW THEN BANTAM NEVER SAY DIE
6437-66173-0020 CONWAY REGARDED THESE BUSINESS LIKE PREPARATIONS WITH EVIDENT MISGIVING FOR HE CALLED RODGERS TO HIS SIDE AND HAD HIMSELF ARRAYED IN A SIMILAR MANNER THOUGH HIS HAIR WAS CROPPED SO CLOSE THAT YOU COULDN'T HAVE TAKEN HOLD OF IT WITH A PAIR OF TWEEZERS
6437-66173-0021 IS YOUR MAN READY ASKED PHIL ADAMS ADDRESSING RODGERS READY KEEP YOUR BACK TO THE GATE TOM
6437-66173-0022 AND YOU'LL HAVE THE SUN IN HIS EYES BEHOLD US ONCE MORE FACE TO FACE LIKE DAVID AND THE PHILISTINE LOOK AT US AS LONG AS YOU MAY FOR THIS IS ALL YOU SHALL SEE OF THE COMBAT
6437-66173-0023 ACCORDING TO MY THINKING THE HOSPITAL TEACHES A BETTER LESSON THAN THE BATTLE FIELD I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT MY BLACK EYE AND MY SWOLLEN LIP IF YOU WILL BUT NOT A WORD OF THE FIGHT
6437-66173-0024 YOU'LL GET NO DESCRIPTION OF IT FROM ME SIMPLY BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD PROVE VERY POOR READING AND NOT BECAUSE I CONSIDER MY REVOLT AGAINST CONWAY'S TYRANNY UNJUSTIFIABLE I HAD BORNE CONWAY'S PERSECUTIONS FOR MANY MONTHS WITH LAMB LIKE PATIENCE
6437-66173-0025 I MIGHT HAVE SHIELDED MYSELF BY APPEALING TO MISTER GRIMSHAW BUT NO BOY IN THE TEMPLE GRAMMAR SCHOOL COULD DO THAT WITHOUT LOSING CASTE WHETHER THIS WAS JUST OR NOT DOESN'T MATTER A PIN SINCE IT WAS SO A TRADITIONARY LAW OF THE PLACE
6437-66173-0026 THE PERSONAL INCONVENIENCE I SUFFERED FROM MY TORMENTOR WAS NOTHING TO THE PAIN HE INFLICTED ON ME INDIRECTLY BY HIS PERSISTENT CRUELTY TO LITTLE BINNY WALLACE I SHOULD HAVE LACKED THE SPIRIT OF A HEN IF I HAD NOT RESENTED IT FINALLY
6437-66173-0027 I AM GLAD THAT I FACED CONWAY AND ASKED NO FAVORS AND GOT RID OF HIM FOREVER I AM GLAD THAT PHIL ADAMS TAUGHT ME TO BOX AND I SAY TO ALL YOUNGSTERS LEARN TO BOX TO RIDE TO PULL AN OAR AND TO SWIM
6437-66173-0028 THE OCCASION MAY COME ROUND WHEN A DECENT PROFICIENCY IN ONE OR THE REST OF THESE ACCOMPLISHMENTS WILL BE OF SERVICE TO YOU IN ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS
6437-66173-0029 EVER WRITTEN FOR BOYS ARE THESE WORDS LEARN TO BOX THEN AS YOU LEARN TO PLAY CRICKET AND FOOTBALL NOT ONE OF YOU WILL BE THE WORSE BUT VERY MUCH THE BETTER FOR LEARNING TO BOX WELL
6437-66173-0030 THAT YOU HAVE TO SAY YES OR NO TO A CHALLENGE TO FIGHT SAY NO IF YOU CAN ONLY TAKE CARE YOU MAKE IT PLAIN TO YOURSELF WHY YOU SAY NO IT'S A PROOF OF THE HIGHEST COURAGE IF DONE FROM TRUE CHRISTIAN MOTIVES
6437-66173-0031 IT'S QUITE RIGHT AND JUSTIFIABLE IF DONE FROM A SIMPLE AVERSION TO PHYSICAL PAIN AND DANGER BUT DON'T SAY NO BECAUSE YOU FEAR A LICKING AND SAY OR THINK IT'S BECAUSE YOU FEAR GOD FOR THAT'S NEITHER CHRISTIAN NOR HONEST AND IF YOU DO FIGHT
6437-66173-0032 FIGHT IT OUT AND DON'T GIVE IN WHILE YOU CAN STAND AND SEE AND DON'T GIVE IN WHEN YOU CAN'T SEE FOR I COULD STAND VERY LITTLE AND SEE NOT AT ALL HAVING POMMELLED THE SCHOOL PUMP FOR THE LAST TWENTY SECONDS
6437-66173-0033 WHEN CONWAY RETIRED FROM THE FIELD AS PHIL ADAMS STEPPED UP TO SHAKE HANDS WITH ME HE RECEIVED A TELLING BLOW IN THE STOMACH FOR ALL THE FIGHT WAS NOT OUT OF ME YET AND I MISTOOK HIM FOR A NEW ADVERSARY
6437-66173-0034 CONVINCED OF MY ERROR I ACCEPTED HIS CONGRATULATIONS WITH THOSE OF THE OTHER BOYS BLANDLY AND BLINDLY I REMEMBER THAT BINNY WALLACE WANTED TO GIVE ME HIS SILVER PENCIL CASE
6437-66173-0035 THE GENTLE SOUL HAD STOOD THROUGHOUT THE CONTEST WITH HIS FACE TURNED TO THE FENCE SUFFERING UNTOLD AGONY
6437-66173-0036 ESCORTED BY TWO OR THREE OF THE SCHOOLFELLOWS I WALKED HOME THROUGH THE PLEASANT AUTUMN TWILIGHT BATTERED BUT TRIUMPHANT AS I WENT ALONG MY CAP COCKED ON ONE SIDE TO KEEP THE CHILLY AIR FROM MY EYE
6437-66173-0037 I FELT THAT I WAS NOT ONLY FOLLOWING MY NOSE BUT FOLLOWING IT SO CLOSELY THAT I WAS IN SOME DANGER OF TREADING ON IT I SEEMED TO HAVE NOSE ENOUGH FOR THE WHOLE PARTY MY LEFT CHEEK ALSO WAS PUFFED OUT LIKE A DUMPLING
6437-66173-0038 I COULDN'T HELP SAYING TO MYSELF IF THIS IS VICTORY HOW ABOUT THAT OTHER FELLOW TOM SAID HARRY BLAKE HESITATING WELL
6437-66173-0039 DID YOU SEE MISTER GRIMSHAW LOOKING OUT OF THE RECITATION ROOM WINDOW JUST AS WE LEFT THE YARD NO WAS HE THOUGH I AM SURE OF IT
6437-66173-0040 SHOULDN'T WONDER NO HE DIDN'T BROKE IN ADAMS OR HE WOULD HAVE STOPPED IT SHORT METRE
6437-66173-0041 WELL IT CAN'T BE HELPED NOW I REFLECTED AS THE MONKEY SAID WHEN HE FELL OUT OF THE COCOANUT TREE ADDED CHARLEY MARDEN TRYING TO MAKE ME LAUGH IT WAS EARLY CANDLE LIGHT WHEN WE REACHED THE HOUSE
6437-66173-0042 MISS ABIGAIL OPENING THE FRONT DOOR STARTED BACK AT MY HILARIOUS APPEARANCE I TRIED TO SMILE UPON HER SWEETLY BUT THE SMILE RIPPLING OVER MY SWOLLEN CHEEK AND DYING AWAY LIKE A SPENT WAVE ON MY NOSE
6437-66173-0043 PRODUCED AN EXPRESSION OF WHICH MISS ABIGAIL DECLARED SHE HAD NEVER SEEN THE LIKE EXCEPTING ON THE FACE OF A CHINESE IDOL SHE HUSTLED ME UNCEREMONIOUSLY INTO THE PRESENCE OF MY GRANDFATHER IN THE SITTING ROOM
6437-66173-0044 CAPTAIN NUTTER AS THE RECOGNIZED PROFESSIONAL WARRIOR OF OUR FAMILY COULD NOT CONSISTENTLY TAKE ME TO TASK FOR FIGHTING CONWAY NOR WAS HE DISPOSED TO DO SO
6437-66173-0045 FOR THE CAPTAIN WAS WELL AWARE OF THE LONG CONTINUED PROVOCATION I HAD ENDURED AH YOU RASCAL CRIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN AFTER HEARING MY STORY JUST LIKE ME WHEN I WAS YOUNG ALWAYS IN ONE KIND OF TROUBLE OR ANOTHER
6437-66173-0046 I BELIEVE IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY I THINK SAID MISS ABIGAIL WITHOUT THE FAINTEST EXPRESSION ON HER COUNTENANCE THAT A TABLE SPOONFUL OF HOT DRO THE CAPTAIN INTERRUPTED MISS ABIGAIL PEREMPTORILY
6437-66173-0047 DIRECTING HER TO MAKE A SHADE OUT OF CARDBOARD AND BLACK SILK TO TIE OVER MY EYE MISS ABIGAIL MUST HAVE BEEN POSSESSED WITH THE IDEA THAT I HAD TAKEN UP PUGILISM AS A PROFESSION FOR SHE TURNED OUT NO FEWER THAN SIX OF THESE BLINDERS
6437-66173-0048 THEY'LL BE HANDY TO HAVE IN THE HOUSE SAYS MISS ABIGAIL GRIMLY OF COURSE SO GREAT A BREACH OF DISCIPLINE WAS NOT TO BE PASSED OVER BY MISTER GRIMSHAW
6437-66173-0049 HE HAD AS WE SUSPECTED WITNESSED THE CLOSING SCENE OF THE FIGHT FROM THE SCHOOL ROOM WINDOW AND THE NEXT MORNING AFTER PRAYERS I WAS NOT WHOLLY UNPREPARED WHEN MASTER CONWAY AND MYSELF WERE CALLED UP TO THE DESK FOR EXAMINATION
6437-66173-0050 AS THE READER IS ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THE LEADING POINTS IN THE CASE OF BAILEY VERSUS CONWAY I SHALL NOT REPORT THE TRIAL FURTHER THAN TO SAY THAT ADAMS MARDEN AND SEVERAL OTHER PUPILS TESTIFIED TO THE FACT
6437-66173-0051 THAT CONWAY HAD IMPOSED ON ME EVER SINCE MY FIRST DAY AT THE TEMPLE SCHOOL THEIR EVIDENCE ALSO WENT TO SHOW THAT CONWAY WAS A QUARRELSOME CHARACTER GENERALLY BAD FOR CONWAY SETH RODGERS ON THE PART OF HIS FRIEND
6437-66173-0052 PROVED THAT I HAD STRUCK THE FIRST BLOW THAT WAS BAD FOR ME IF YOU PLEASE SIR SAID BINNY WALLACE HOLDING UP HIS HAND FOR PERMISSION TO SPEAK BAILEY DIDN'T FIGHT ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT HE FOUGHT ON MY ACCOUNT AND IF YOU PLEASE SIR
6437-66173-0053 I AM THE BOY TO BE BLAMED FOR I WAS THE CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE THIS DREW OUT THE STORY OF CONWAY'S HARSH TREATMENT OF THE SMALLER BOYS AS BINNY RELATED THE WRONGS OF HIS PLAYFELLOWS SAYING VERY LITTLE OF HIS OWN GRIEVANCES
6437-66173-0054 I NOTICED THAT MISTER GRIMSHAW'S HAND UNKNOWN TO HIMSELF PERHAPS RESTED LIGHTLY FROM TIME TO TIME ON WALLACE'S SUNNY HAIR THE EXAMINATION FINISHED MISTER GRIMSHAW LEANED ON THE DESK THOUGHTFULLY FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SAID
6437-66173-0055 EVERY BOY IN THIS SCHOOL KNOWS THAT IT IS AGAINST THE RULES TO FIGHT IF ONE BOY MALTREATS ANOTHER WITHIN SCHOOL BOUNDS OR WITHIN SCHOOL HOURS THAT IS A MATTER FOR ME TO SETTLE THE CASE SHOULD BE LAID BEFORE ME
6437-66173-0056 I DISAPPROVE OF TALE BEARING I NEVER ENCOURAGE IT IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE BUT WHEN ONE PUPIL SYSTEMATICALLY PERSECUTES A SCHOOLMATE IT IS THE DUTY OF SOME HEAD BOY TO INFORM ME NO PUPIL HAS A RIGHT TO TAKE THE LAW INTO HIS OWN HANDS
6437-66173-0057 IF THERE IS ANY FIGHTING TO BE DONE I AM THE PERSON TO BE CONSULTED I DISAPPROVE OF BOYS FIGHTING IT IS UNNECESSARY AND UNCHRISTIAN IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE I CONSIDER EVERY LARGE BOY IN THIS SCHOOL AT FAULT
6437-66173-0058 BUT AS THE OFFENCE IS ONE OF OMISSION RATHER THAN COMMISSION MY PUNISHMENT MUST REST ONLY ON THE TWO BOYS CONVICTED OF MISDEMEANOR CONWAY LOSES HIS RECESS FOR A MONTH AND BAILEY HAS A PAGE ADDED TO HIS LATIN LESSONS FOR THE NEXT FOUR RECITATIONS
6437-66173-0059 I NOW REQUEST BAILEY AND CONWAY TO SHAKE HANDS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE SCHOOL AND ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR REGRET AT WHAT HAS OCCURRED CONWAY AND I APPROACHED EACH OTHER SLOWLY AND CAUTIOUSLY AS IF WE WERE BENT UPON ANOTHER HOSTILE COLLISION
6437-66173-0060 WE CLASPED HANDS IN THE TAMEST MANNER IMAGINABLE AND CONWAY MUMBLED I'M SORRY I FOUGHT WITH YOU I THINK YOU ARE I REPLIED DRILY AND I'M SORRY I HAD TO THRASH YOU
6437-66173-0061 YOU CAN GO TO YOUR SEATS SAID MISTER GRIMSHAW TURNING HIS FACE ASIDE TO HIDE A SMILE I AM SURE MY APOLOGY WAS A VERY GOOD ONE I NEVER HAD ANY MORE TROUBLE WITH CONWAY
6437-66173-0062 HE AND HIS SHADOW SETH RODGERS GAVE ME A WIDE BERTH FOR MANY MONTHS NOR WAS BINNY WALLACE SUBJECTED TO FURTHER MOLESTATION MISS ABIGAIL'S SANITARY STORES INCLUDING A BOTTLE OF OPODELDOC WERE NEVER CALLED INTO REQUISITION
6476-57446-0000 BUT IN THE MIDST OF GAIETY HIS HEART YEARNED ALL THE WHILE FOR HIS LOST LOVE AND HIS MERRIMENT WAS BUT MOURNING IN DISGUISE AT LAST THE NIGHT WORE ON AND AS HE WAS RETIRING ALONG THE CORRIDOR HE SAW A MAN OF ABOUT FORTY YEARS OF AGE
6476-57446-0001 WITH LONG HAIR COMING TOWARDS HIM WHO WHEN HE SAW GENZABURO CRIED OUT DEAR ME WHY THIS MUST BE MY YOUNG LORD GENZABURO WHO HAS COME OUT TO ENJOY HIMSELF GENZABURO THOUGHT THIS RATHER STRANGE BUT
6476-57446-0002 LOOKING AT THE MAN ATTENTIVELY RECOGNIZED HIM AS A RETAINER WHOM HE HAD HAD IN HIS EMPLOY THE YEAR BEFORE AND SAID THIS IS A CURIOUS MEETING PRAY WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN ABOUT SINCE YOU LEFT MY SERVICE AT ANY RATE
6476-57446-0003 I MAY CONGRATULATE YOU ON BEING WELL AND STRONG WHERE ARE YOU LIVING NOW WELL SIR SINCE I PARTED FROM YOU I HAVE BEEN EARNING A LIVING AS A FORTUNE TELLER AT KANDA AND HAVE CHANGED MY NAME TO KAJI SAZEN
6476-57446-0004 I AM LIVING IN A POOR AND HUMBLE HOUSE BUT IF YOUR LORDSHIP AT YOUR LEISURE WOULD HONOUR ME WITH A VISIT WELL IT'S A LUCKY CHANCE THAT HAS BROUGHT US TOGETHER AND I CERTAINLY WILL GO AND SEE YOU BESIDES I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME
6476-57446-0005 SHALL YOU BE AT HOME THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW CERTAINLY SIR I SHALL MAKE A POINT OF BEING AT HOME VERY WELL THEN THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW I WILL GO TO YOUR HOUSE I SHALL BE AT YOUR SERVICE SIR AND NOW AS IT IS GETTING LATE
6476-57446-0006 I WILL TAKE MY LEAVE FOR TO NIGHT GOOD NIGHT THEN WE SHALL MEET THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW AND SO THE TWO PARTED AND WENT THEIR SEVERAL WAYS TO REST ON THE APPOINTED DAY GENZABURO MADE HIS PREPARATIONS AND WENT IN DISGUISE WITHOUT ANY RETAINERS
6476-57446-0007 TO CALL UPON SAZEN WHO MET HIM AT THE PORCH OF HIS HOUSE AND SAID THIS IS A GREAT HONOUR MY LORD GENZABURO IS INDEED WELCOME MY HOUSE IS VERY MEAN BUT LET ME INVITE YOUR LORDSHIP TO COME INTO AN INNER CHAMBER
6476-57446-0008 PRAY REPLIED GENZABURO DON'T MAKE ANY CEREMONY FOR ME DON'T PUT YOURSELF TO ANY TROUBLE ON MY ACCOUNT AND SO HE PASSED IN AND SAZEN CALLED TO HIS WIFE TO PREPARE WINE AND CONDIMENTS AND THEY BEGAN TO FEAST
6476-57446-0009 AT LAST GENZABURO LOOKING SAZEN IN THE FACE SAID THERE IS A SERVICE WHICH I WANT YOU TO RENDER ME A VERY SECRET SERVICE BUT AS IF YOU WERE TO REFUSE ME I SHOULD BE PUT TO SHAME BEFORE I TELL YOU WHAT THAT SERVICE IS
6476-57446-0010 WELL THEN SAID GENZABURO GREATLY PLEASED AND DRAWING TEN RIYOS FROM HIS BOSOM THIS IS BUT A SMALL PRESENT TO MAKE TO YOU ON MY FIRST VISIT BUT PRAY ACCEPT IT NO INDEED I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR LORDSHIP WISHES OF ME
6476-57446-0011 HOW HE HAD FIRST MET HER AND FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER AT THE ADZUMA BRIDGE HOW CHOKICHI HAD INTRODUCED HER TO HIM AT THE TEA HOUSE AT OJI AND THEN WHEN SHE FELL ILL AND HE WANTED TO SEE HER AGAIN INSTEAD OF BRINGING HER TO HIM HAD ONLY GIVEN HIM GOOD ADVICE
6476-57446-0012 AND SO GENZABURO DREW A LAMENTABLE PICTURE OF HIS STATE OF DESPAIR SAZEN LISTENED PATIENTLY TO HIS STORY AND AFTER REFLECTING FOR A WHILE REPLIED WELL SIR IT'S NOT A DIFFICULT MATTER TO SET RIGHT
6476-57446-0013 WHEN GENZABURO HEARD THIS HE FELT GREATLY RELIEVED AND RECOMMENDING SAZEN TO DO HIS BEST IN THE MATTER TOOK HIS LEAVE AND RETURNED HOME THAT VERY NIGHT SAZEN AFTER THINKING OVER ALL THAT GENZABURO HAD TOLD HIM
6476-57446-0014 LAID HIS PLANS ACCORDINGLY AND WENT OFF TO THE HOUSE OF KIHACHI THE ETA CHIEF AND TOLD HIM THE COMMISSION WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED KIHACHI WAS OF COURSE GREATLY ASTONISHED AND SAID SOME TIME AGO SIR CHOKICHI CAME HERE
6476-57446-0015 AND SAID THAT MY LORD GENZABURO HAVING BEEN REBUKED BY HIS FAMILY FOR HIS PROFLIGATE BEHAVIOUR HAD DETERMINED TO BREAK OFF HIS CONNECTION WITH MY DAUGHTER OF COURSE I KNEW THAT THE DAUGHTER OF AN ETA WAS NO FITTING MATCH FOR A NOBLEMAN
6476-57446-0016 SO WHEN CHOKICHI CAME AND TOLD ME THE ERRAND UPON WHICH HE HAD BEEN SENT I HAD NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO ANNOUNCE TO MY DAUGHTER THAT SHE MUST GIVE UP ALL THOUGHT OF HIS LORDSHIP SINCE THAT TIME SHE HAS BEEN FRETTING AND PINING AND STARVING FOR LOVE
6476-57446-0017 BUT WHEN I TELL HER WHAT YOU HAVE JUST SAID HOW GLAD AND HAPPY SHE WILL BE LET ME GO AND TALK TO HER AT ONCE
6476-57446-0018 WELL AT ANY RATE I HAVE SOME NEWS FOR YOU THAT WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY A MESSENGER HAS COME FROM MY LORD GENZABURO FOR WHOM YOUR HEART YEARNS AT THIS O KOYO WHO HAD BEEN CROUCHING DOWN LIKE A DROOPING FLOWER GAVE A GREAT START AND CRIED OUT IS THAT REALLY TRUE
6476-57446-0019 IT IS CHOKICHI WHO HAS BEEN THROWING OBSTACLES IN THE WAY AT LAST HIS LORDSHIP HAS SECRETLY SENT A MAN CALLED KAJI SAZEN A FORTUNE TELLER TO ARRANGE AN INTERVIEW BETWEEN YOU SO NOW MY CHILD YOU MAY CHEER UP
6476-57446-0020 AND GO TO MEET YOUR LOVER AS SOON AS YOU PLEASE WHEN O KOYO HEARD THIS SHE WAS SO HAPPY THAT SHE THOUGHT IT MUST ALL BE A DREAM AND DOUBTED HER OWN SENSES KIHACHI IN THE MEANWHILE REJOINED SAZEN IN THE OTHER ROOM AND
6476-57446-0021 AFTER TELLING HIM OF THE JOY WITH WHICH HIS DAUGHTER HAD HEARD THE NEWS PUT BEFORE HIM WINE AND OTHER DELICACIES I THINK SAID SAZEN THAT THE BEST WAY WOULD BE FOR O KOYO TO LIVE SECRETLY IN MY LORD GENZABURO'S HOUSE
6476-57446-0022 BUT AS IT WILL NEVER DO FOR ALL THE WORLD TO KNOW OF IT IT MUST BE MANAGED VERY QUIETLY AND FURTHER WHEN I GET HOME I MUST THINK OUT SOME PLAN TO LULL THE SUSPICIONS OF THAT FELLOW CHOKICHI AND LET YOU KNOW MY IDEA BY LETTER
6476-57446-0023 MEANWHILE O KOYO HAD BETTER COME HOME WITH ME TO NIGHT ALTHOUGH SHE IS SO TERRIBLY OUT OF SPIRITS NOW SHE SHALL MEET GENZABURO THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW KIHACHI REPORTED THIS TO O KOYO AND AS HER PINING FOR GENZABURO WAS THE ONLY CAUSE OF HER SICKNESS
6476-57446-0024 SHE RECOVERED HER SPIRITS AT ONCE AND SAYING THAT SHE WOULD GO WITH SAZEN IMMEDIATELY JOYFULLY MADE HER PREPARATIONS THEN SAZEN HAVING ONCE MORE WARNED KIHACHI TO KEEP THE MATTER SECRET FROM CHOKICHI AND TO ACT UPON THE LETTER WHICH HE SHOULD SEND HIM
6476-57446-0025 RETURNED HOME TAKING WITH HIM O KOYO AND AFTER O KOYO HAD BATHED AND DRESSED HER HAIR AND PAINTED HERSELF AND PUT ON BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES SHE CAME OUT LOOKING SO LOVELY THAT NO PRINCESS IN THE LAND COULD VIE WITH HER AND SAZEN WHEN HE SAW HER
6476-57446-0026 SAID TO HIMSELF THAT IT WAS NO WONDER THAT GENZABURO HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER THEN AS IT WAS GETTING LATE HE ADVISED HER TO GO TO REST AND AFTER SHOWING HER TO HER APARTMENTS WENT TO HIS OWN ROOM AND WROTE HIS LETTER TO KIHACHI
6476-57446-0027 CONTAINING THE SCHEME WHICH HE HAD DEVISED WHEN KIHACHI RECEIVED HIS INSTRUCTIONS HE WAS FILLED WITH ADMIRATION AT SAZEN'S INGENUITY AND PUTTING ON AN APPEARANCE OF GREAT ALARM AND AGITATION
6476-57446-0028 WENT OFF IMMEDIATELY TO CALL ON CHOKICHI AND SAID TO HIM OH MASTER CHOKICHI SUCH A TERRIBLE THING HAS HAPPENED PRAY LET ME TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT INDEED WHAT CAN IT BE OH SIR ANSWERED KIHACHI
6476-57446-0029 PRETENDING TO WIPE AWAY HIS TEARS MY DAUGHTER O KOYO MOURNING OVER HER SEPARATION FROM MY LORD GENZABURO AT FIRST REFUSED ALL SUSTENANCE AND REMAINED NURSING HER SORROWS UNTIL LAST NIGHT HER WOMAN'S HEART FAILING TO BEAR UP AGAINST HER GREAT GRIEF
6476-57446-0030 SHE DROWNED HERSELF IN THE RIVER LEAVING BEHIND HER A PAPER ON WHICH SHE HAD WRITTEN HER INTENTION WHEN CHOKICHI HEARD THIS HE WAS THUNDERSTRUCK AND EXCLAIMED CAN THIS REALLY BE TRUE AND WHEN I THINK THAT IT WAS I WHO FIRST INTRODUCED HER TO MY LORD
6476-57446-0031 I AM ASHAMED TO LOOK YOU IN THE FACE OH SAY NOT SO MISFORTUNES ARE THE PUNISHMENT DUE FOR OUR MISDEEDS IN A FORMER STATE OF EXISTENCE I BEAR YOU NO ILL WILL THIS MONEY WHICH I HOLD IN MY HAND WAS MY DAUGHTER'S
6476-57446-0032 TO YOU THROUGH WHOSE INTERVENTION SHE BECAME ALLIED WITH A NOBLEMAN
6476-57446-0033 YOU AMAZE ME REPLIED THE OTHER HOW COULD I ABOVE ALL MEN
6476-57446-0034 AT LAST CHOKICHI AFTER MUCH PERSUASION AND GREATLY TO HIS OWN DISTRESS WAS OBLIGED TO ACCEPT THE MONEY AND WHEN KIHACHI HAD CARRIED OUT ALL SAZEN'S INSTRUCTIONS HE RETURNED HOME
6476-57446-0035 AND AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT IT WAS THE VERY LETTER WHICH CONTAINED SAZEN'S INSTRUCTIONS TO KIHACHI AND IN WHICH THE WHOLE STORY WHICH HAD JUST AFFECTED HIM SO MUCH WAS MADE UP WHEN HE PERCEIVED THE TRICK THAT HAD BEEN PLAYED UPON HIM HE WAS VERY ANGRY AND EXCLAIMED
6476-57446-0036 AND ALL IN VAIN WELL THEY'VE GULLED ME ONCE BUT I'LL BE EVEN WITH THEM YET AND HINDER THEIR GAME BEFORE IT IS PLAYED OUT
6476-57446-0037 AND WENT OFF SECRETLY TO PROWL ABOUT SAZEN'S HOUSE TO WATCH FOR O KOYO DETERMINED TO PAY OFF GENZABURO AND SAZEN FOR THEIR CONDUCT TO HIM IN THE MEANWHILE SAZEN WHO DID NOT FOR A MOMENT SUSPECT WHAT HAD HAPPENED
6476-57446-0038 WHEN THE DAY WHICH HAD BEEN FIXED UPON BY HIM AND GENZABURO ARRIVED MADE O KOYO PUT ON HER BEST CLOTHES SMARTENED UP HIS HOUSE AND GOT READY A FEAST AGAINST GENZABURO'S ARRIVAL THE LATTER CAME PUNCTUALLY TO HIS TIME
6476-57446-0039 AND GOING IN AT ONCE SAID TO THE FORTUNE TELLER
6476-57446-0040 LOST HEART ENTIRELY AND MADE UP HIS MIND TO GO HOME AGAIN SAZEN HOWEVER PRESSED HIM SO EAGERLY THAT AT LAST HE WENT UPSTAIRS TO SEE THIS VAUNTED BEAUTY AND SAZEN DRAWING ASIDE A SCREEN SHOWED HIM O KOYO WHO WAS SITTING THERE
6476-57446-0041 PRAY DON'T MENTION IT SIR BUT AS IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE YOU HAVE MET THE YOUNG LADY YOU MUST HAVE A GREAT DEAL TO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER SO I WILL GO DOWNSTAIRS AND IF YOU WANT ANYTHING PRAY CALL ME AND SO HE WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND LEFT THEM
6476-57446-0042 THEN GENZABURO ADDRESSING O KOYO SAID AH IT IS INDEED A LONG TIME SINCE WE MET HOW HAPPY IT MAKES ME TO SEE YOU AGAIN WHY YOUR FACE HAS GROWN QUITE THIN POOR THING HAVE YOU BEEN UNHAPPY
6476-57446-0043 AND O KOYO WITH THE TEARS STARTING FROM HER EYES FOR JOY HID HER FACE AND HER HEART WAS SO FULL THAT SHE COULD NOT SPEAK BUT GENZABURO PASSING HIS HAND GENTLY OVER HER HEAD AND BACK AND COMFORTING HER SAID
6476-57446-0044 COME SWEETHEART THERE IS NO NEED TO SOB SO TALK TO ME A LITTLE AND LET ME HEAR YOUR VOICE AT LAST O KOYO RAISED HER HEAD AND SAID AH
6476-57446-0045 AND THOUGHT THAT I SHOULD NEVER MEET YOU AGAIN HOW TENDERLY I THOUGHT OF YOU
6476-57446-0046 SAZEN CAME WITH A MESSAGE FROM YOU I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL A DREAM AND AS SHE SPOKE SHE BENT HER HEAD AND SOBBED AGAIN AND IN GENZABURO'S EYES SHE SEEMED MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER
6476-57446-0047 WITH HER PALE DELICATE FACE AND HE LOVED HER BETTER THAN BEFORE THEN SHE SAID
6476-57446-0048 I SHOULD NEVER STOP YES REPLIED GENZABURO I TOO HAVE SUFFERED MUCH AND SO THEY TOLD ONE ANOTHER THEIR MUTUAL GRIEFS AND FROM THAT DAY FORTH THEY CONSTANTLY MET AT SAZEN'S HOUSE
6476-57446-0049 ONE DAY AS THEY WERE FEASTING AND ENJOYING THEMSELVES IN AN UPPER STOREY IN SAZEN'S HOUSE CHOKICHI CAME TO THE HOUSE AND SAID I BEG PARDON BUT DOES ONE MASTER SAZEN LIVE HERE CERTAINLY SIR I AM SAZEN AT YOUR SERVICE
6476-57446-0050 AND MY NAME IS CHOKICHI I BEG TO BESPEAK YOUR GOODWILL FOR MYSELF I HOPE WE MAY BE FRIENDS SAZEN WAS NOT A LITTLE TAKEN ABACK AT THIS HOWEVER HE PUT ON AN INNOCENT FACE AS THOUGH HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF CHOKICHI BEFORE AND SAID
6476-57446-0051 I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING WHY I THOUGHT YOU WERE SOME RESPECTABLE PERSON AND YOU HAVE THE IMPUDENCE TO TELL ME THAT YOUR NAME IS CHOKICHI
6476-57446-0052 TO THINK OF SUCH A SHAMELESS VILLAIN COMING AND ASKING TO BE FRIENDS WITH ME FORSOOTH GET YOU GONE THE QUICKER THE BETTER
6476-57446-0053 WHY I THOUGHT YOU MUST BE ONE OF US INSOLENT KNAVE BEGONE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
6476-57446-0054 YOU HAD BETTER GET RID OF O KOYO AS WELL I SUPPOSE SHE MUST EQUALLY BE A POLLUTION TO IT THIS PUT SAZEN RATHER IN A DILEMMA HOWEVER HE MADE UP HIS MIND NOT TO SHOW ANY HESITATION AND SAID WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
6476-57446-0055 THERE IS NO O KOYO HERE AND I NEVER SAW SUCH A PERSON IN MY LIFE CHOKICHI QUIETLY DREW OUT OF THE BOSOM OF HIS DRESS THE LETTER FROM SAZEN TO KIHACHI WHICH HE HAD PICKED UP A FEW DAYS BEFORE AND SHOWING IT TO SAZEN REPLIED
6476-57446-0056 AND AS HE PRETENDED TO LEAVE THE HOUSE SAZEN AT HIS WITS END CRIED OUT STOP STOP
6476-57446-0057 PRAY STOP AND LISTEN QUIETLY IT IS QUITE TRUE AS YOU SAID THAT O KOYO IS IN MY HOUSE AND REALLY YOUR INDIGNATION IS PERFECTLY JUST COME LET US TALK OVER MATTERS A LITTLE
6476-57446-0058 IN ORDER THAT I MAY BE REVENGED FOR THE FRAUD THAT WAS PUT UPON ME WON'T YOU ACCEPT TWENTY FIVE RIYOS TWENTY FIVE RIYOS NO INDEED I WILL NOT TAKE A FRACTION LESS THAN A HUNDRED AND IF I CANNOT GET THEM I WILL REPORT THE WHOLE MATTER AT ONCE
6476-57446-0059 SAZEN AFTER A MOMENT'S CONSIDERATION HIT UPON A SCHEME AND ANSWERED SMILING
6476-57446-0060 YOU SHALL HAVE THE HUNDRED RIYOS YOU ASK FOR BUT AS I HAVE NOT SO MUCH MONEY BY ME AT PRESENT I WILL GO TO GENZABURO'S HOUSE AND FETCH IT IT'S GETTING DARK NOW BUT IT'S NOT VERY LATE
6476-57446-0061 SO I'LL TROUBLE YOU TO COME WITH ME AND THEN I CAN GIVE YOU THE MONEY TO NIGHT CHOKICHI CONSENTING TO THIS THE PAIR LEFT THE HOUSE TOGETHER NOW SAZEN WHO AS A RONIN WORE A LONG DIRK IN HIS GIRDLE
6476-57446-0062 KEPT LOOKING OUT FOR A MOMENT WHEN CHOKICHI SHOULD BE OFF HIS GUARD IN ORDER TO KILL HIM BUT CHOKICHI KEPT HIS EYES OPEN AND DID NOT GIVE SAZEN A CHANCE AT LAST CHOKICHI AS ILL LUCK WOULD HAVE IT STUMBLED AGAINST A STONE AND FELL
6476-57446-0063 AND SAZEN PROFITING BY THE CHANCE DREW HIS DIRK AND STABBED HIM IN THE SIDE AND AS CHOKICHI TAKEN BY SURPRISE TRIED TO GET UP HE CUT HIM SEVERELY OVER THE HEAD UNTIL AT LAST HE FELL DEAD
6476-57446-0064 SAZEN THEN LOOKING AROUND HIM AND SEEING TO HIS GREAT DELIGHT THAT THERE WAS NO ONE NEAR RETURNED HOME THE FOLLOWING DAY CHOKICHI'S BODY WAS FOUND BY THE POLICE AND WHEN THEY EXAMINED IT THEY FOUND NOTHING UPON IT SAVE A PAPER WHICH THEY READ
6476-57446-0065 AND WHICH PROVED TO BE THE VERY LETTER WHICH SAZEN HAD SENT TO KIHACHI AND WHICH CHOKICHI HAD PICKED UP THE MATTER WAS IMMEDIATELY REPORTED TO THE GOVERNOR AND SAZEN HAVING BEEN SUMMONED AN INVESTIGATION WAS HELD
6476-57446-0066 SAZEN CUNNING AND BOLD MURDERER AS HE WAS LOST HIS SELF POSSESSION WHEN HE SAW WHAT A FOOL HE HAD BEEN NOT TO GET BACK FROM CHOKICHI THE LETTER WHICH HE HAD WRITTEN AND WHEN HE WAS PUT TO A RIGID EXAMINATION UNDER TORTURE
6476-57446-0067 CONFESSED THAT HE HAD HIDDEN O KOYO AT GENZABURO'S INSTIGATION AND THEN KILLED CHOKICHI WHO HAD FOUND OUT THE SECRET UPON THIS THE GOVERNOR AFTER CONSULTING ABOUT GENZABURO'S CASE DECIDED THAT
6476-57446-0068 AS HE HAD DISGRACED HIS POSITION AS A HATAMOTO BY CONTRACTING AN ALLIANCE WITH THE DAUGHTER OF AN ETA HIS PROPERTY SHOULD BE CONFISCATED HIS FAMILY BLOTTED OUT AND HIMSELF BANISHED AS FOR KIHACHI THE ETA CHIEF AND HIS DAUGHTER O KOYO
6476-57446-0069 AND BY HIM THEY TOO WERE BANISHED WHILE SAZEN AGAINST WHOM THE MURDER OF CHOKICHI HAD BEEN FULLY PROVED WAS EXECUTED ACCORDING TO LAW NOTE AT ASAKUSA IN YEDO THERE LIVES A MAN CALLED DANZAYEMON
6476-57446-0070 THIS MAN TRACES HIS PEDIGREE BACK TO MINAMOTO NO YORITOMO
6476-57446-0071 THE THIRTY SIXTH LAW PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS ALL WANDERING MENDICANTS SUCH AS MALE SORCERERS FEMALE DIVINERS HERMITS BLIND PEOPLE BEGGARS AND TANNERS ETAS HAVE HAD FROM OF OLD THEIR RESPECTIVE RULERS
6476-57446-0072 BE NOT DISINCLINED HOWEVER TO PUNISH ANY SUCH WHO GIVE RISE TO DISPUTES OR WHO OVERSTEP THE BOUNDARIES OF THEIR OWN CLASSES AND ARE DISOBEDIENT TO EXISTING LAWS
6476-57446-0073 AND IF THEY ARE VERY POOR THEY WANDER FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE WORKING AS COBBLERS MENDING OLD SHOES AND LEATHER AND SO EARN A SCANTY LIVELIHOOD BESIDES THIS THEIR DAUGHTERS AND YOUNG MARRIED WOMEN GAIN A TRIFLE AS WANDERING MINSTRELS CALLED TORIOI
6476-57446-0074 PLAYING ON THE SHAMISEN A SORT OF BANJO AND SINGING BALLADS THEY NEVER MARRY OUT OF THEIR OWN FRATERNITY BUT REMAIN APART A DESPISED AND SHUNNED RACE AT EXECUTIONS BY CRUCIFIXION
6476-57446-0075 AND BESIDES THIS THEY HAVE TO PERFORM ALL SORTS OF DEGRADING OFFICES ABOUT CRIMINALS SUCH AS CARRYING SICK PRISONERS FROM THEIR CELLS TO THE HALL OF JUSTICE AND BURYING THE BODIES OF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN EXECUTED
6476-57446-0076 THUS THEIR RACE IS POLLUTED AND ACCURSED AND THEY ARE HATED ACCORDINGLY NOW THIS IS HOW THE ETAS CAME TO BE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF DANZAYEMON WHEN MINAMOTO NO YORITOMO WAS YET A CHILD HIS FATHER MINAMOTO NO YOSHITOMO
6476-57446-0077 BUT KIYOMORI DESIRING TO DESTROY THE FAMILY OF YOSHITOMO ROOT AND BRANCH ORDERED HIS RETAINERS TO DIVIDE THEMSELVES INTO BANDS AND SEEK OUT THE CHILDREN AT LAST THEY WERE FOUND BUT TOKIWA WAS SO EXCEEDINGLY BEAUTIFUL
6476-57446-0078 THAT KIYOMORI WAS INFLAMED WITH LOVE FOR HER AND DESIRED HER TO BECOME HIS OWN CONCUBINE THEN TOKIWA TOLD KIYOMORI THAT IF HE WOULD SPARE HER LITTLE ONES SHE WOULD SHARE HIS COUCH
6476-57446-0079 BUT THAT IF HE KILLED HER CHILDREN SHE WOULD DESTROY HERSELF RATHER THAN YIELD TO HIS DESIRE WHEN HE HEARD THIS KIYOMORI BEWILDERED BY THE BEAUTY OF TOKIWA SPARED THE LIVES OF HER CHILDREN BUT BANISHED THEM FROM THE CAPITAL
6476-57446-0080 AND WHEN HE GREW UP AND BECAME A MAN HE MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF A PEASANT AFTER A WHILE YORITOMO LEFT THE PROVINCE AND WENT TO THE WARS LEAVING HIS WIFE PREGNANT AND IN DUE TIME SHE WAS DELIVERED OF A MALE CHILD
6476-57446-0081 TO THE DELIGHT OF HER PARENTS WHO REJOICED THAT THEIR DAUGHTER SHOULD BEAR SEED TO A NOBLEMAN BUT SHE SOON FELL SICK AND DIED AND THE OLD PEOPLE TOOK CHARGE OF THE BABE AND WHEN THEY ALSO DIED THE CARE OF THE CHILD FELL TO HIS MOTHER'S KINSMEN
6476-57446-0082 AND HE GREW UP TO BE A PEASANT NOW KIYOMORI THE ENEMY OF YORITOMO HAD BEEN GATHERED TO HIS FATHERS AND YORITOMO HAD AVENGED THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER BY SLAYING MUNEMORI THE SON OF KIYOMORI AND THERE WAS PEACE THROUGHOUT THE LAND
6476-57446-0083 AND YORITOMO BECAME THE CHIEF OF ALL THE NOBLE HOUSES IN JAPAN AND FIRST ESTABLISHED THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COUNTRY WHEN YORITOMO HAD THUS RAISED HIMSELF TO POWER
6476-57446-0084 AND HIS DESCENDANTS AFTER HIM LIVED AS PEASANTS IN THE SAME VILLAGE INCREASING IN PROSPERITY AND IN GOOD REPUTE AMONG THEIR NEIGHBOURS BUT THE PRINCELY LINE OF YORITOMO CAME TO AN END IN THREE GENERATIONS
6476-57446-0085 SO HE SUMMONED HIM AND SAID IT IS A HARD THING TO SEE THE SON OF AN ILLUSTRIOUS HOUSE LIVE AND DIE A PEASANT I WILL PROMOTE YOU TO THE RANK OF SAMURAI THEN THE PEASANT ANSWERED MY LORD
6476-57446-0086 IF I BECOME A SAMURAI AND THE RETAINER OF SOME NOBLE I SHALL NOT BE SO HAPPY AS WHEN I WAS MY OWN MASTER IF I MAY NOT REMAIN A HUSBANDMAN LET ME BE A CHIEF OVER MEN HOWEVER HUMBLE THEY MAY BE
6476-57446-0087 AND THINKING TO PUNISH THE PEASANT FOR HIS INSOLENCE SAID
6476-96661-0000 AND THEIR MOTHER WAS LEDA WHO AFTER THE TWIN BROTHERS HAD ANOTHER CHILD BORN TO HER HELEN FOR WHOSE SAKE THE SONS OF MANY OF JASON'S FRIENDS WERE TO WAGE WAR AGAINST THE GREAT CITY OF TROY
6476-96661-0001 IN QUEST OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE AND THEN THERE CAME ONE WHO HAD BOTH WELCOME AND REVERENCE FROM JASON THIS ONE CAME WITHOUT SPEAR OR BOW BEARING IN HIS HANDS A LYRE ONLY HE WAS ORPHEUS
6476-96661-0002 AND HE KNEW ALL THE WAYS OF THE GODS AND ALL THE STORIES OF THE GODS WHEN HE SANG TO HIS LYRE THE TREES WOULD LISTEN AND THE BEASTS WOULD FOLLOW HIM
6476-96661-0003 CHIRON THE CENTAUR HAD MET HIM AS HE WAS WANDERING THROUGH THE FORESTS ON THE MOUNTAIN PELION AND HAD SENT HIM DOWN INTO IOLCUS THEN THERE CAME TWO MEN WELL SKILLED IN THE HANDLING OF SHIPS TIPHYS AND NAUPLIUS
6476-96661-0004 TIPHYS KNEW ALL ABOUT THE SUN AND WINDS AND STARS AND ALL ABOUT THE SIGNS BY WHICH A SHIP MIGHT BE STEERED AND NAUPLIUS HAD THE LOVE OF POSEIDON THE GOD OF THE SEA AFTERWARD THERE CAME ONE AFTER THE OTHER
6476-96661-0005 TWO WHO WERE FAMOUS FOR THEIR HUNTING NO TWO COULD BE MORE DIFFERENT THAN THESE TWO WERE THE FIRST WAS ARCAS HE WAS DRESSED IN THE SKIN OF A BEAR HE HAD RED HAIR AND SAVAGE LOOKING EYES
6476-96661-0006 AND FOR ARMS HE CARRIED A MIGHTY BOW WITH BRONZE TIPPED ARROWS THE FOLK WERE WATCHING AN EAGLE AS HE CAME INTO THE CITY AN EAGLE THAT WAS WINGING ITS WAY FAR FAR UP IN THE SKY ARCAS DREW HIS BOW AND WITH ONE ARROW HE BROUGHT THE EAGLE DOWN
6476-96661-0007 AND THEN HE WAS THE OLDEST OF THE HEROES IN THE CAMP OF AGAMEMNON TWO BROTHERS CAME WHO WERE TO BE SPECIAL FRIENDS OF JASON'S PELEUS AND TELAMON BOTH WERE STILL YOUTHFUL AND NEITHER HAD YET ACHIEVED ANY NOTABLE DEED
6476-96661-0008 ANOTHER WHO CAME WAS ADMETUS AFTERWARD HE BECAME A FAMOUS KING THE GOD APOLLO ONCE MADE HIMSELF A SHEPHERD AND HE KEPT THE FLOCKS OF KING ADMETUS AND THERE CAME TWO BROTHERS TWINS WHO WERE A WONDER TO ALL WHO BEHELD THEM
6476-96661-0009 THEIR MOTHER WAS OREITHYIA THE DAUGHTER OF ERECHTHEUS KING OF ATHENS AND THEIR FATHER WAS BOREAS THE NORTH WIND THESE TWO BROTHERS HAD ON THEIR ANKLES WINGS THAT GLEAMED WITH GOLDEN SCALES THEIR BLACK HAIR WAS THICK UPON THEIR SHOULDERS
6476-96661-0010 WHOSE NAME WAS THESEUS THESEUS'S FATHER WAS AN UNKNOWN KING HE HAD BIDDEN THE MOTHER SHOW THEIR SON WHERE HIS SWORD WAS HIDDEN UNDER A GREAT STONE THE KING HAD HIDDEN IT BEFORE THESEUS WAS BORN
6476-96661-0011 ON THE DAY THAT THE MESSENGERS HAD SET OUT TO BRING THROUGH GREECE THE WORD OF JASON'S GOING FORTH IN QUEST OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE
6476-96661-0012 THEY BEGAN TO FELL TREES FOR THE TIMBERS OF THE SHIP THAT WAS TO MAKE THE VOYAGE TO FAR COLCHIS
6476-96661-0013 THE HARBOR OF IOLCUS ON THE NIGHT OF THE DAY HE HAD HELPED TO BRING THEM DOWN JASON HAD A DREAM HE DREAMT THAT SHE WHOM HE HAD SEEN IN THE FOREST WAYS AND AFTERWARD BY THE RIVER ANAURUS APPEARED TO HIM
6476-96661-0014 HE WENT TO THE CITY'S GATE AND HE MET SUCH A MAN ARGUS WAS HIS NAME HE TOLD JASON THAT A DREAM HAD SENT HIM TO THE CITY OF IOLCUS JASON WELCOMED HIM AND LODGED HIM IN THE KING'S PALACE
6476-96661-0015 JASON HAD THEM TAKE THE BEAM FROM THE ROOF OF THE PALACE
6476-96661-0016 AND THAT DAY THE BUILDING OF THE GREAT SHIP WAS BEGUN
6476-96661-0017 CAME THE NOISE OF HAMMERING IN THE STREET WHERE THE METALWORKERS WERE CAME THE NOISE OF BEATING UPON METALS AS THE SMITHS FASHIONED OUT OF BRONZE ARMOR FOR THE HEROES AND SWORDS AND SPEARS EVERY DAY
6476-96661-0018 UNDER THE EYES OF ARGUS THE MASTER THE SHIP THAT HAD IN IT THE BEAM FROM ZEUS'S GROVE WAS BUILT HIGHER AND WIDER AND THOSE WHO WERE BUILDING THE SHIP OFTEN FELT GOING THROUGH IT TREMORS AS OF A LIVING CREATURE
6476-96661-0019 WHEN THE SHIP WAS BUILT AND MADE READY FOR THE VOYAGE A NAME WAS GIVEN TO IT THE ARGO IT WAS CALLED
6476-96661-0020 ALL WAS READY FOR THE VOYAGE AND NOW JASON WENT WITH HIS FRIENDS TO VIEW THE SHIP BEFORE SHE WAS BROUGHT INTO THE WATER ARGUS THE MASTER WAS ON THE SHIP SEEING TO IT THAT THE LAST THINGS WERE BEING DONE BEFORE ARGO WAS LAUNCHED
6476-96661-0021 VERY GRAVE AND WISE LOOKED ARGUS ARGUS THE BUILDER OF THE SHIP AND WONDERFUL TO THE HEROES THE SHIP LOOKED NOW THAT ARGUS FOR THEIR VIEWING HAD SET UP THE MAST WITH THE SAILS AND HAD EVEN PUT THE OARS IN THEIR PLACES
6476-96661-0022 WONDERFUL TO THE HEROES ARGO LOOKED WITH HER LONG OARS AND HER HIGH SAILS WITH HER TIMBERS PAINTED RED AND GOLD AND BLUE AND WITH A MARVELOUS FIGURE CARVED UPON HER PROW ALL OVER THE SHIP JASON'S EYES WENT
6476-96661-0023 HE SAW A FIGURE STANDING BY THE MAST FOR A MOMENT HE LOOKED ON IT AND THEN THE FIGURE BECAME SHADOWY
6476-96661-0024 THEN MAST AND SAILS WERE TAKEN DOWN AND THE OARS WERE LEFT IN THE SHIP AND THE ARGO WAS LAUNCHED INTO THE WATER THE HEROES WENT BACK TO THE PALACE OF KING PELIAS TO FEAST WITH THE KING'S GUESTS BEFORE THEY TOOK THEIR PLACES ON THE SHIP
6476-96661-0025 SETTING OUT ON THE VOYAGE TO FAR COLCHIS WHEN THEY CAME INTO THE PALACE THEY SAW THAT ANOTHER HERO HAD ARRIVED HIS SHIELD WAS HUNG IN THE HALL THE HEROES ALL GATHERED AROUND AMAZED AT THE SIZE AND THE BEAUTY OF IT
6476-96661-0026 STRIFE AND PURSUIT AND FLIGHT TUMULT AND PANIC AND SLAUGHTER THE FIGURE OF FATE WAS THERE DRAGGING A DEAD MAN BY THE FEET
6476-96661-0027 AROUND THESE FIGURES WERE HEADS OF SNAKES HEADS WITH BLACK JAWS AND GLITTERING EYES TWELVE HEADS SUCH AS MIGHT AFFRIGHT ANY MAN
6476-96661-0028 THERE WERE MEN FIGHTING AND WOMEN WATCHING FROM HIGH TOWERS THE AWFUL FIGURE OF THE DARKNESS OF DEATH WAS SHOWN THERE TOO WITH MOURNFUL EYES AND THE DUST OF BATTLES UPON HER SHOULDERS THE OUTER RIM OF THE SHIELD
6476-96661-0029 SHOWED THE STREAM OF OCEAN THE STREAM THAT ENCIRCLES THE WORLD SWANS WERE SOARING ABOVE AND SWIMMING ON ITS SURFACE ALL IN WONDER THE HEROES GAZED ON THE GREAT SHIELD TELLING EACH OTHER THAT ONLY ONE MAN IN ALL THE WORLD COULD CARRY IT
6529-62554-0000 SO THEN ALL WAS EXPLAINED BY THE SUBMARINE EXPLOSION OF THIS TORPEDO CYRUS HARDING COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN AS DURING THE WAR OF THE UNION HE HAD HAD OCCASION TO TRY THESE TERRIBLE ENGINES OF DESTRUCTION
6529-62554-0001 OR SOME OTHER MATERIAL OF THE SAME NATURE THAT THE WATER OF THE CHANNEL HAD BEEN RAISED LIKE A DOME THE BOTTOM OF THE BRIG CRUSHED IN AND SHE HAD SUNK INSTANTLY THE DAMAGE DONE TO HER HULL
6529-62554-0002 THE SPEEDY HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO WITHSTAND A TORPEDO THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED AN IRONCLAD AS EASILY AS A FISHING BOAT YES ALL WAS EXPLAINED EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE PRESENCE OF THE TORPEDO IN THE WATERS OF THE CHANNEL
6529-62554-0003 AND I SAY THIS IN ORDER THAT AYRTON MAY BE ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THE STRANGE EVENTS WHICH HAVE OCCURRED DURING THESE TWO YEARS WHO THIS BENEFICENT STRANGER IS WHOSE INTERVENTION HAS SO FORTUNATELY FOR US BEEN MANIFESTED ON MANY OCCASIONS I CANNOT IMAGINE
6529-62554-0004 WHAT HIS OBJECT CAN BE IN ACTING THUS IN CONCEALING HIMSELF AFTER RENDERING US SO MANY SERVICES I CANNOT UNDERSTAND BUT HIS SERVICES ARE NOT THE LESS REAL
6529-62554-0005 AND ARE OF SUCH A NATURE THAT ONLY A MAN POSSESSED OF PRODIGIOUS POWER COULD RENDER THEM AYRTON IS INDEBTED TO HIM AS MUCH AS WE ARE FOR IF IT WAS THE STRANGER WHO SAVED ME FROM THE WAVES AFTER THE FALL FROM THE BALLOON
6529-62554-0006 THAT IT WAS HE WHO LIGHTED THAT FIRE ON THE HEIGHTS OF THE ISLAND WHICH PERMITTED YOU TO LAND THAT IT WAS HE WHO FIRED THAT BULLET FOUND IN THE BODY OF THE PECCARY THAT IT WAS HE WHO PLUNGED THAT TORPEDO INTO THE CHANNEL WHICH DESTROYED THE BRIG
6529-62554-0007 IN A WORD THAT ALL THOSE INEXPLICABLE EVENTS FOR WHICH WE COULD NOT ASSIGN A REASON ARE DUE TO THIS MYSTERIOUS BEING THEREFORE WHOEVER HE MAY BE WHETHER SHIPWRECKED OR EXILED ON OUR ISLAND WE SHALL BE UNGRATEFUL IF WE THINK OURSELVES FREED FROM GRATITUDE TOWARDS HIM
6529-62554-0008 WE HAVE CONTRACTED A DEBT AND I HOPE THAT WE SHALL ONE DAY PAY IT YOU ARE RIGHT IN SPEAKING THUS MY DEAR CYRUS REPLIED GIDEON SPILETT YES THERE IS AN ALMOST ALL POWERFUL BEING HIDDEN IN SOME PART OF THE ISLAND
6529-62554-0009 AND WHOSE INFLUENCE HAS BEEN SINGULARLY USEFUL TO OUR COLONY I WILL ADD THAT THE UNKNOWN APPEARS TO POSSESS MEANS OF ACTION WHICH BORDER ON THE SUPERNATURAL IF IN THE EVENTS OF PRACTICAL LIFE THE SUPERNATURAL WERE RECOGNIZABLE
6529-62554-0010 IS IT HE WHO IS IN SECRET COMMUNICATION WITH US BY THE WELL IN GRANITE HOUSE AND HAS HE THUS A KNOWLEDGE OF ALL OUR PLANS WAS IT HE WHO THREW US THAT BOTTLE WHEN THE VESSEL MADE HER FIRST CRUISE
6529-62554-0011 WAS IT HE WHO THREW TOP OUT OF THE LAKE AND KILLED THE DUGONG WAS IT HE WHO AS EVERYTHING LEADS US TO BELIEVE SAVED YOU FROM THE WAVES AND THAT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH ANY ONE ELSE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACT IF IT WAS HE
6529-62554-0012 HE POSSESSES A POWER WHICH RENDERS HIM MASTER OF THE ELEMENTS THE REPORTER'S REASONING WAS JUST AND EVERY ONE FELT IT TO BE SO YES REJOINED CYRUS HARDING
6529-62554-0013 IF THE INTERVENTION OF A HUMAN BEING IS NOT MORE QUESTIONABLE FOR US I AGREE THAT HE HAS AT HIS DISPOSAL MEANS OF ACTION BEYOND THOSE POSSESSED BY HUMANITY THERE IS A MYSTERY STILL BUT IF WE DISCOVER THE MAN THE MYSTERY WILL BE DISCOVERED ALSO THE QUESTION THEN IS
6529-62554-0014 WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THE MATTER MY OPINION SAID PENCROFT IS THAT WHOEVER HE MAY BE HE IS A BRAVE MAN AND HE HAS MY ESTEEM BE IT SO ANSWERED HARDING BUT THAT IS NOT AN ANSWER PENCROFT
6529-62554-0015 MASTER THEN SAID NEBRASKA MY IDEA IS THAT WE MAY SEARCH AS LONG AS WE LIKE FOR THIS GENTLEMAN WHOM YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT BUT THAT WE SHALL NOT DISCOVER HIM TILL HE PLEASES THAT'S NOT BAD WHAT YOU SAY NEBRASKA OBSERVED PENCROFT
6529-62554-0016 I AM OF NEB'S OPINION SAID GIDEON SPILETT BUT THAT IS NO REASON FOR NOT ATTEMPTING THE ADVENTURE WHETHER WE FIND THIS MYSTERIOUS BEING OR NOT WE SHALL AT LEAST HAVE FULFILLED OUR DUTY TOWARDS HIM
6529-62554-0017 AND YOU MY BOY GIVE US YOUR OPINION SAID THE ENGINEER TURNING TO HERBERT OH CRIED HERBERT HIS COUNTENANCE FULL OF ANIMATION HOW I SHOULD LIKE TO THANK HIM HE WHO SAVED YOU FIRST AND WHO HAS NOW SAVED US
6529-62554-0018 OF COURSE MY BOY REPLIED PENCROFT SO WOULD I AND ALL OF US I AM NOT INQUISITIVE BUT I WOULD GIVE ONE OF MY EYES TO SEE THIS INDIVIDUAL FACE TO FACE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HE MUST BE HANDSOME TALL STRONG WITH A SPLENDID BEARD RADIANT HAIR
6529-62554-0019 BUT PENCROFT ANSWERED SPILETT YOU ARE DESCRIBING A PICTURE OF THE CREATOR POSSIBLY MISTER SPILETT REPLIED THE SAILOR BUT THAT IS HOW I IMAGINE HIM AND YOU AYRTON ASKED THE ENGINEER CAPTAIN HARDING REPLIED AYRTON
6529-62554-0020 YOU ARE OUR COMPANION YOU HAVE ALREADY ENDANGERED YOUR LIFE SEVERAL TIMES FOR US AND YOU AS WELL AS THE REST OUGHT TO BE CONSULTED IN THE MATTER OF ANY IMPORTANT DECISION SPEAK THEREFORE CAPTAIN HARDING REPLIED AYRTON
6529-62554-0021 I TOO AS YOU SAID HAVE A DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO PAY HIM IT WAS HE IT COULD BE ONLY HE WHO MUST HAVE COME TO TABOR ISLAND WHO FOUND THERE THE WRETCH YOU KNEW AND WHO MADE KNOWN TO YOU THAT THERE WAS AN UNFORTUNATE MAN THERE TO BE SAVED
6529-62554-0022 THEREFORE IT IS THANKS TO HIM THAT I HAVE BECOME A MAN AGAIN NO I WILL NEVER FORGET HIM THAT IS SETTLED THEN SAID CYRUS HARDING WE WILL BEGIN OUR RESEARCHES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WE WILL NOT LEAVE A CORNER OF THE ISLAND UNEXPLORED
6529-62554-0023 WE WILL SEARCH INTO ITS MOST SECRET RECESSES AND WILL HOPE THAT OUR UNKNOWN FRIEND WILL PARDON US IN CONSIDERATION OF OUR INTENTIONS FOR SEVERAL DAYS THE COLONISTS WERE ACTIVELY EMPLOYED IN HAYMAKING AND THE HARVEST
6529-62554-0024 BEFORE PUTTING THEIR PROJECT OF EXPLORING THE YET UNKNOWN PARTS OF THE ISLAND INTO EXECUTION THEY WISHED TO GET ALL POSSIBLE WORK FINISHED IT WAS ALSO THE TIME FOR COLLECTING THE VARIOUS VEGETABLES FROM THE TABOR ISLAND PLANTS ALL WAS STOWED AWAY
6529-62554-0025 AND HAPPILY THERE WAS NO WANT OF ROOM IN GRANITE HOUSE IN WHICH THEY MIGHT HAVE HOUSED ALL THE TREASURES OF THE ISLAND THE PRODUCTS OF THE COLONY WERE THERE METHODICALLY ARRANGED AND IN A SAFE PLACE AS MAY BE BELIEVED SHELTERED AS MUCH FROM ANIMALS AS FROM MAN
6529-62554-0026 THERE WAS NO FEAR OF DAMP IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT THICK MASS OF GRANITE MANY NATURAL EXCAVATIONS SITUATED IN THE UPPER PASSAGE WERE ENLARGED EITHER BY PICK AXE OR MINE AND GRANITE HOUSE THUS BECAME A GENERAL WAREHOUSE
6529-62554-0027 CONTAINING ALL THE PROVISIONS ARMS TOOLS AND SPARE UTENSILS IN A WORD ALL THE STORES OF THE COLONY AS TO THE GUNS OBTAINED FROM THE BRIG THEY WERE PRETTY PIECES OF ORDNANCE WHICH AT PENCROFT'S ENTREATY
6529-62554-0028 WERE HOISTED BY MEANS OF TACKLE AND PULLEYS RIGHT UP INTO GRANITE HOUSE EMBRASURES WERE MADE BETWEEN THE WINDOWS AND THE SHINING MUZZLES OF THE GUNS COULD SOON BE SEEN THROUGH THE GRANITE CLIFF FROM THIS HEIGHT THEY COMMANDED ALL UNION BAY
6529-62554-0029 IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING IF WE TRIED THE RANGE OF OUR GUNS DO YOU THINK THAT IS USEFUL ASKED THE ENGINEER IT IS MORE THAN USEFUL IT IS NECESSARY WITHOUT THAT HOW ARE WE TO KNOW TO WHAT DISTANCE WE CAN SEND ONE OF THOSE PRETTY SHOT WITH WHICH WE ARE PROVIDED
6529-62554-0030 TRY THEM PENCROFT REPLIED THE ENGINEER HOWEVER I THINK THAT IN MAKING THE EXPERIMENT WE OUGHT TO EMPLOY
6529-62554-0031 BUT THE PYROXYLE WHICH WILL NEVER FAIL US CAN THE CANNON SUPPORT THE SHOCK OF THE PYROXYLE ASKED THE REPORTER WHO WAS NOT LESS ANXIOUS THAN PENCROFT TO TRY THE ARTILLERY OF GRANITE HOUSE I BELIEVE SO HOWEVER ADDED THE ENGINEER WE WILL BE PRUDENT
6529-62554-0032 THE TRANSIT DESCRIBED BY THE BALL OUGHT TO BE AS EXTENDED AS POSSIBLE AND THIS TENSION COULD ONLY BE OBTAINED UNDER THE CONDITION THAT THE PROJECTILE SHOULD BE IMPELLED WITH A VERY GREAT INITIAL VELOCITY NOW SAID HARDING TO HIS COMPANIONS
6529-62554-0033 THE INITIAL VELOCITY IS IN PROPORTION TO THE QUANTITY OF POWDER USED IN THE FABRICATION OF THESE PIECES EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON EMPLOYING A METAL WITH THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE POWER OF RESISTANCE AND STEEL IS INCONTESTABLY THAT METAL OF ALL OTHERS WHICH RESISTS THE BEST
6529-62554-0034 I HAVE THEREFORE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT OUR GUNS WILL BEAR WITHOUT RISK THE EXPANSION OF THE PYROXYLE GAS AND WILL GIVE EXCELLENT RESULTS WE SHALL BE A GREAT DEAL MORE CERTAIN OF THAT WHEN WE HAVE TRIED THEM ANSWERED PENCROFT
6529-62554-0035 IT IS UNNECESSARY TO SAY THAT THE FOUR CANNONS WERE IN PERFECT ORDER SINCE THEY HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THE WATER THE SAILOR HAD BESTOWED GREAT CARE UPON THEM HOW MANY HOURS HE HAD SPENT IN RUBBING GREASING AND POLISHING THEM AND IN CLEANING THE MECHANISM
6529-62554-0036 AND NOW THE PIECES WERE AS BRILLIANT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ON BOARD A FRIGATE OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY ON THIS DAY THEREFORE IN PRESENCE OF ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COLONY INCLUDING MASTER JUP AND TOP THE FOUR CANNON WERE SUCCESSIVELY TRIED
6529-62554-0037 THEY WERE CHARGED WITH PYROXYLE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ITS EXPLOSIVE POWER WHICH AS HAS BEEN SAID IS FOUR TIMES THAT OF ORDINARY POWDER THE PROJECTILE TO BE FIRED WAS CYLINDROCONIC PENCROFT HOLDING THE END OF THE QUICK MATCH
6529-62554-0038 SUCH A SHOT THE HONOR OF WHICH BELONGED TO HIS DEAR BOY THE THIRD SHOT AIMED THIS TIME AT THE DOWNS FORMING THE UPPER SIDE OF UNION BAY STRUCK THE SAND AT A DISTANCE OF FOUR MILES THEN HAVING RICOCHETED WAS LOST IN THE SEA IN A CLOUD OF SPRAY
6529-62554-0039 FOR THE FOURTH PIECE CYRUS HARDING SLIGHTLY INCREASED THE CHARGE SO AS TO TRY ITS EXTREME RANGE THEN ALL STANDING ASIDE FOR FEAR OF ITS BURSTING THE MATCH WAS LIGHTED BY MEANS OF A LONG CORD
6529-62554-0040 A TREMENDOUS REPORT WAS HEARD BUT THE PIECE HAD HELD GOOD AND THE COLONISTS RUSHING TO THE WINDOWS SAW THE SHOT GRAZE THE ROCKS OF MANDIBLE CAPE NEARLY FIVE MILES FROM GRANITE HOUSE AND DISAPPEAR IN SHARK GULF
6529-62554-0041 BELIEVE ME PENCROFT REPLIED THE ENGINEER IT WOULD BE BETTER NOT TO HAVE TO MAKE THE EXPERIMENT WELL SAID THE SAILOR WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE WITH REGARD TO THOSE SIX VILLAINS WHO ARE ROAMING ABOUT THE ISLAND
6529-62554-0042 ARE WE TO LEAVE THEM TO OVERRUN OUR FORESTS OUR FIELDS OUR PLANTATIONS THESE PIRATES ARE REGULAR JAGUARS AND IT SEEMS TO ME WE OUGHT NOT TO HESITATE TO TREAT THEM AS SUCH
6529-62554-0043 TURNING TO HIS COMPANION AYRTON HESITATED AT FIRST TO REPLY AND CYRUS HARDING REGRETTED THAT PENCROFT HAD SO THOUGHTLESSLY PUT THIS QUESTION AND HE WAS MUCH MOVED WHEN AYRTON REPLIED IN A HUMBLE TONE
6529-62554-0044 HE HAS AS MUCH RIGHT TO SPEAK HERE AS ANY ONE YES SAID GIDEON SPILETT BUT HIS RESERVE DOES HIM HONOR AND IT IS RIGHT TO RESPECT THE FEELING WHICH HE HAS ABOUT HIS SAD PAST CERTAINLY MISTER SPILETT ANSWERED THE SAILOR
6529-62554-0045 IS THAT YOUR OPINION PENCROFT ASKED THE ENGINEER QUITE MY OPINION AND BEFORE HUNTING THEM MERCILESSLY YOU WOULD NOT WAIT UNTIL THEY HAD COMMITTED SOME FRESH ACT OF HOSTILITY AGAINST US
6529-62554-0046 PENCROFT THINK OF AYRTON SAID HERBERT TAKING THE SAILOR'S HAND HE BECAME AN HONEST MAN AGAIN PENCROFT LOOKED AT HIS COMPANIONS ONE AFTER THE OTHER HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF HIS PROPOSAL BEING MET WITH ANY OBJECTION
6529-62554-0047 HIS ROUGH NATURE COULD NOT ALLOW THAT THEY OUGHT TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE RASCALS WHO HAD LANDED ON THE ISLAND WITH BOB HARVEY'S ACCOMPLICES THE MURDERERS OF THE CREW OF THE SPEEDY AND HE LOOKED UPON THEM AS WILD BEASTS WHICH OUGHT TO BE DESTROYED WITHOUT DELAY AND WITHOUT REMORSE
6529-62554-0048 YOU WISH TO BE GENEROUS TO THOSE VILLAINS VERY WELL I HOPE WE MAYN'T REPENT IT WHAT DANGER SHALL WE RUN SAID HERBERT IF WE TAKE CARE TO BE ALWAYS ON OUR GUARD HUM OBSERVED THE REPORTER WHO HAD NOT GIVEN ANY DECIDED OPINION
6529-62554-0049 THEY ARE SIX AND WELL ARMED IF THEY EACH LAY HID IN A CORNER AND EACH FIRED AT ONE OF US THEY WOULD SOON BE MASTERS OF THE COLONY WHY HAVE THEY NOT DONE SO SAID HERBERT NO DOUBT BECAUSE IT WAS NOT THEIR INTEREST TO DO IT BESIDES WE ARE SIX ALSO
6529-62554-0050 WELL WELL REPLIED PENCROFT WHOM NO REASONING COULD HAVE CONVINCED LET US LEAVE THESE GOOD PEOPLE TO DO WHAT THEY LIKE AND DON'T THINK ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THEM COME PENCROFT SAID NEBRASKA DON'T MAKE YOURSELF OUT SO BAD AS ALL THAT
6529-62554-0051 SUPPOSE ONE OF THESE UNFORTUNATE MEN WERE HERE BEFORE YOU WITHIN GOOD RANGE OF YOUR GUNS YOU WOULD NOT FIRE I WOULD FIRE ON HIM AS I WOULD ON A MAD DOG NEBRASKA REPLIED PENCROFT COLDLY PENCROFT SAID THE ENGINEER
6529-62554-0052 YOU HAVE ALWAYS SHOWN MUCH DEFERENCE TO MY ADVICE WILL YOU IN THIS MATTER YIELD TO ME I WILL DO AS YOU PLEASE CAPTAIN HARDING ANSWERED THE SAILOR WHO WAS NOT AT ALL CONVINCED VERY WELL WAIT
6529-62554-0053 AND WE WILL NOT ATTACK THEM UNLESS WE ARE ATTACKED FIRST THUS THEIR BEHAVIOR TOWARDS THE PIRATES WAS AGREED UPON ALTHOUGH PENCROFT AUGURED NOTHING GOOD FROM IT THEY WERE NOT TO ATTACK THEM BUT WERE TO BE ON THEIR GUARD
6529-62554-0054 AFTER ALL THE ISLAND WAS LARGE AND FERTILE IF ANY SENTIMENT OF HONESTY YET REMAINED IN THE BOTTOM OF THEIR HEARTS THESE WRETCHES MIGHT PERHAPS BE RECLAIMED WAS IT NOT THEIR INTEREST IN THE SITUATION IN WHICH THEY FOUND THEMSELVES TO BEGIN A NEW LIFE
6529-62554-0055 AT ANY RATE FOR HUMANITY'S SAKE ALONE IT WOULD BE RIGHT TO WAIT THE COLONISTS WOULD NO LONGER AS BEFORE BE ABLE TO GO AND COME WITHOUT FEAR HITHERTO THEY HAD ONLY WILD BEASTS TO GUARD AGAINST
6529-62554-0056 AND NOW SIX CONVICTS OF THE WORST DESCRIPTION PERHAPS WERE ROAMING OVER THEIR ISLAND IT WAS SERIOUS CERTAINLY AND TO LESS BRAVE MEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SECURITY LOST NO MATTER
6529-62556-0000 AT HERBERT'S CRY PENCROFT LETTING HIS GUN FALL RUSHED TOWARDS HIM THEY HAVE KILLED HIM HE CRIED MY BOY THEY HAVE KILLED HIM CYRUS HARDING AND GIDEON SPILETT RAN TO HERBERT THE REPORTER LISTENED TO ASCERTAIN IF THE POOR LAD'S HEART WAS STILL BEATING
6529-62556-0001 HE LIVES SAID HE BUT HE MUST BE CARRIED TO GRANITE HOUSE THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE REPLIED THE ENGINEER INTO THE CORRAL THEN SAID PENCROFT IN A MOMENT SAID HARDING AND HE RAN ROUND THE LEFT CORNER OF THE PALISADE
6529-62556-0002 THERE HE FOUND A CONVICT WHO AIMING AT HIM SENT A BALL THROUGH HIS HAT IN A FEW SECONDS BEFORE HE HAD EVEN TIME TO FIRE HIS SECOND BARREL HE FELL STRUCK TO THE HEART BY HARDING'S DAGGER MORE SURE EVEN THAN HIS GUN DURING THIS TIME
6529-62556-0003 GIDEON SPILETT AND THE SAILOR HOISTED THEMSELVES OVER THE PALISADE LEAPED INTO THE ENCLOSURE THREW DOWN THE PROPS WHICH SUPPORTED THE INNER DOOR RAN INTO THE EMPTY HOUSE AND SOON POOR HERBERT WAS LYING ON AYRTON'S BED IN A FEW MOMENTS HARDING WAS BY HIS SIDE
6529-62556-0004 ON SEEING HERBERT SENSELESS THE SAILOR'S GRIEF WAS TERRIBLE HE SOBBED HE CRIED HE TRIED TO BEAT HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WALL NEITHER THE ENGINEER NOR THE REPORTER COULD CALM HIM
6529-62556-0005 WITHOUT ACQUIRING SOME SLIGHT KNOWLEDGE OF MEDICINE HE KNEW A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING AND SEVERAL TIMES HE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO ATTEND TO WOUNDS PRODUCED EITHER BY A SWORD BAYONET OR SHOT ASSISTED BY CYRUS HARDING HE PROCEEDED TO RENDER THE AID HERBERT REQUIRED
6529-62556-0006 THE REPORTER WAS IMMEDIATELY STRUCK BY THE COMPLETE STUPOR IN WHICH HERBERT LAY A STUPOR OWING EITHER TO THE HEMORRHAGE OR TO THE SHOCK THE BALL HAVING STRUCK A BONE WITH SUFFICIENT FORCE TO PRODUCE A VIOLENT CONCUSSION HERBERT WAS DEADLY PALE AND HIS PULSE SO FEEBLE
6529-62556-0007 THAT SPILETT ONLY FELT IT BEAT AT LONG INTERVALS AS IF IT WAS ON THE POINT OF STOPPING THESE SYMPTOMS WERE VERY SERIOUS HERBERT'S CHEST WAS LAID BARE AND THE BLOOD HAVING BEEN STANCHED WITH HANDKERCHIEFS IT WAS BATHED WITH COLD WATER
6529-62556-0008 HE UTTERED A MOAN SO FEEBLE THAT THEY ALMOST THOUGHT IT WAS HIS LAST SIGH HERBERTS BACK WAS COVERED WITH BLOOD FROM ANOTHER CONTUSED WOUND BY WHICH THE BALL HAD IMMEDIATELY ESCAPED GOD BE PRAISED SAID THE REPORTER THE BALL IS NOT IN THE BODY AND WE SHALL NOT HAVE TO EXTRACT IT
6529-62556-0009 BUT THE HEART ASKED HARDING THE HEART HAS NOT BEEN TOUCHED IF IT HAD BEEN HERBERT WOULD BE DEAD DEAD EXCLAIMED PENCROFT WITH A GROAN THE SAILOR HAD ONLY HEARD THE LAST WORDS UTTERED BY THE REPORTER
6529-62556-0010 NO PENCROFT REPLIED CYRUS HARDING NO HE IS NOT DEAD HIS PULSE STILL BEATS HE HAS EVEN UTTERED A MOAN BUT FOR YOUR BOY'S SAKE CALM YOURSELF WE HAVE NEED OF ALL OUR SELF POSSESSION DO NOT MAKE US LOSE IT MY FRIEND
6529-62556-0011 PENCROFT WAS SILENT BUT A REACTION SET IN AND GREAT TEARS ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS IN THE MEANWHILE GIDEON SPILETT ENDEAVORED TO COLLECT HIS IDEAS AND PROCEED METHODICALLY AFTER HIS EXAMINATION HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT THE BALL
6529-62556-0012 ENTERING IN FRONT BETWEEN THE SEVENTH AND EIGHTH RIBS HAD ISSUED BEHIND BETWEEN THE THIRD AND FOURTH BUT WHAT MISCHIEF HAD THE BALL COMMITTED IN ITS PASSAGE WHAT IMPORTANT ORGANS HAD BEEN REACHED A PROFESSIONAL SURGEON WOULD HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING THIS AT ONCE
6529-62556-0013 AND STILL MORE SO THE REPORTER HOWEVER HE KNEW ONE THING THIS WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO PREVENT THE INFLAMMATORY STRANGULATION OF THE INJURED PARTS THEN TO CONTEND WITH THE LOCAL INFLAMMATION AND FEVER WHICH WOULD RESULT FROM THE WOUND PERHAPS MORTAL
6529-62556-0014 NOW WHAT STYPTICS WHAT ANTIPHLOGISTICS OUGHT TO BE EMPLOYED BY WHAT MEANS COULD INFLAMMATION BE PREVENTED AT ANY RATE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WAS THAT THE TWO WOUNDS SHOULD BE DRESSED WITHOUT DELAY
6529-62556-0015 IT DID NOT APPEAR NECESSARY TO GIDEON SPILETT THAT A FRESH FLOW OF BLOOD SHOULD BE CAUSED BY BATHING THEM IN TEPID WATER AND COMPRESSING THEIR LIPS THE HEMORRHAGE HAD BEEN VERY ABUNDANT AND HERBERT WAS ALREADY TOO MUCH ENFEEBLED BY THE LOSS OF BLOOD
6529-62556-0016 THE REPORTER THEREFORE THOUGHT IT BEST TO SIMPLY BATHE THE TWO WOUNDS WITH COLD WATER HERBERT WAS PLACED ON HIS LEFT SIDE AND WAS MAINTAINED IN THAT POSITION HE MUST NOT BE MOVED SAID GIDEON SPILETT
6529-62556-0017 HE IS IN THE MOST FAVORABLE POSITION FOR THE WOUNDS IN HIS BACK AND CHEST TO SUPPURATE EASILY AND ABSOLUTE REST IS NECESSARY WHAT CAN'T WE CARRY HIM TO GRANITE HOUSE ASKED PENCROFT NO PENCROFT REPLIED THE REPORTER
6529-62556-0018 CYRUS SAID HE I AM NOT A SURGEON I AM IN TERRIBLE PERPLEXITY YOU MUST AID ME WITH YOUR ADVICE YOUR EXPERIENCE TAKE COURAGE MY FRIEND ANSWERED THE ENGINEER PRESSING THE REPORTER'S HAND JUDGE COOLLY
6529-62556-0019 THINK ONLY OF THIS HERBERT MUST BE SAVED THESE WORDS RESTORED TO GIDEON SPILETT THAT SELF POSSESSION WHICH HE HAD LOST IN A MOMENT OF DISCOURAGEMENT ON FEELING HIS GREAT RESPONSIBILITY HE SEATED HIMSELF CLOSE TO THE BED CYRUS HARDING STOOD NEAR
6529-62556-0020 PENCROFT HAD TORN UP HIS SHIRT AND WAS MECHANICALLY MAKING LINT SPILETT THEN EXPLAINED TO CYRUS HARDING THAT HE THOUGHT HE OUGHT FIRST OF ALL TO STOP THE HEMORRHAGE BUT NOT CLOSE THE TWO WOUNDS OR CAUSE THEIR IMMEDIATE CICATRIZATION FOR THERE HAD BEEN INTERNAL PERFORATION
6529-62556-0021 AND THE SUPPURATION MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO ACCUMULATE IN THE CHEST HARDING APPROVED ENTIRELY AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE TWO WOUNDS SHOULD BE DRESSED WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO CLOSE THEM BY IMMEDIATE COAPTATION AND NOW
6529-62556-0022 DID THE COLONISTS POSSESS AN EFFICACIOUS AGENT TO ACT AGAINST THE INFLAMMATION WHICH MIGHT OCCUR YES THEY HAD ONE FOR NATURE HAD GENEROUSLY LAVISHED IT THEY HAD COLD WATER THAT IS TO SAY THE MOST POWERFUL SEDATIVE THAT CAN BE EMPLOYED AGAINST INFLAMMATION OF WOUNDS
6529-62556-0023 THE MOST EFFICACIOUS THERAPEUTIC AGENT IN GRAVE CASES AND THE ONE WHICH IS NOW ADOPTED BY ALL PHYSICIANS COLD WATER HAS MOREOVER THE ADVANTAGE OF LEAVING THE WOUND IN ABSOLUTE REST AND PRESERVING IT FROM ALL PREMATURE DRESSING A CONSIDERABLE ADVANTAGE
6529-62556-0024 SINCE IT HAS BEEN FOUND BY EXPERIENCE THAT CONTACT WITH THE AIR IS DANGEROUS DURING THE FIRST DAYS GIDEON SPILETT AND CYRUS HARDING REASONED THUS WITH THEIR SIMPLE GOOD SENSE AND THEY ACTED AS THE BEST SURGEON WOULD HAVE DONE
6529-62556-0025 COMPRESSES OF LINEN WERE APPLIED TO POOR HERBERT'S TWO WOUNDS AND WERE KEPT CONSTANTLY WET WITH COLD WATER THE SAILOR HAD AT FIRST LIGHTED A FIRE IN THE HUT WHICH WAS NOT WANTING IN THINGS NECESSARY FOR LIFE MAPLE SUGAR MEDICINAL PLANTS
6529-62556-0026 THE SAME WHICH THE LAD HAD GATHERED ON THE BANKS OF LAKE GRANT ENABLED THEM TO MAKE SOME REFRESHING DRINKS WHICH THEY GAVE HIM WITHOUT HIS TAKING ANY NOTICE OF IT HIS FEVER WAS EXTREMELY HIGH AND ALL THAT DAY AND NIGHT PASSED WITHOUT HIS BECOMING CONSCIOUS
6529-62556-0027 HERBERT'S LIFE HUNG ON A THREAD AND THIS THREAD MIGHT BREAK AT ANY MOMENT THE NEXT DAY THE TWELFTH OF NOVEMBER THE HOPES OF HARDING AND HIS COMPANIONS SLIGHTLY REVIVED HERBERT HAD COME OUT OF HIS LONG STUPOR HE OPENED HIS EYES HE RECOGNIZED CYRUS HARDING
6529-62556-0028 THE REPORTER AND PENCROFT HE UTTERED TWO OR THREE WORDS HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED THEY TOLD HIM AND SPILETT BEGGED HIM TO REMAIN PERFECTLY STILL TELLING HIM THAT HIS LIFE WAS NOT IN DANGER AND THAT HIS WOUNDS WOULD HEAL IN A FEW DAYS
6529-62556-0029 HOWEVER HERBERT SCARCELY SUFFERED AT ALL AND THE COLD WATER WITH WHICH THEY WERE CONSTANTLY BATHED PREVENTED ANY INFLAMMATION OF THE WOUNDS THE SUPPURATION WAS ESTABLISHED IN A REGULAR WAY THE FEVER DID NOT INCREASE
6529-62556-0030 AND IT MIGHT NOW BE HOPED THAT THIS TERRIBLE WOUND WOULD NOT INVOLVE ANY CATASTROPHE PENCROFT FELT THE SWELLING OF HIS HEART GRADUALLY SUBSIDE HE WAS LIKE A SISTER OF MERCY LIKE A MOTHER BY THE BED OF HER CHILD
6529-62556-0031 HERBERT DOZED AGAIN BUT HIS SLEEP APPEARED MORE NATURAL TELL ME AGAIN THAT YOU HOPE MISTER SPILETT SAID PENCROFT TELL ME AGAIN THAT YOU WILL SAVE HERBERT YES WE WILL SAVE HIM REPLIED THE REPORTER THE WOUND IS SERIOUS AND PERHAPS
6529-62556-0032 EVEN THE BALL HAS TRAVERSED THE LUNGS BUT THE PERFORATION OF THIS ORGAN IS NOT FATAL GOD BLESS YOU ANSWERED PENCROFT AS MAY BE BELIEVED DURING THE FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS THEY HAD BEEN IN THE CORRAL THE COLONISTS HAD NO OTHER THOUGHT THAN THAT OF NURSING HERBERT
6529-62556-0033 THEY DID NOT THINK EITHER OF THE DANGER WHICH THREATENED THEM SHOULD THE CONVICTS RETURN OR OF THE PRECAUTIONS TO BE TAKEN FOR THE FUTURE BUT ON THIS DAY WHILE PENCROFT WATCHED BY THE SICK BED CYRUS HARDING AND THE REPORTER CONSULTED AS TO WHAT IT WOULD BE BEST TO DO
6529-62556-0034 AT THE MOMENT HE SCALED THE PALISADE HAD CLEARLY SEEN SOME ONE OF THE CONVICTS RUNNING ALONG THE SOUTHERN SPUR OF MOUNT FRANKLIN TOWARDS WHOM TOP HAD SPRUNG IT WAS ONE OF THOSE WHOSE OBJECT HAD BEEN SO COMPLETELY DEFEATED BY THE ROCKS AT THE MOUTH OF THE MERCY
6529-62556-0035 AND AS HE WAS A MAN TO DEFEND HIMSELF HE MUST HAVE BEEN OVERPOWERED YES THAT IS TO BE FEARED SAID THE REPORTER THEN DOUBTLESS THE CONVICTS INSTALLED THEMSELVES IN THE CORRAL WHERE THEY FOUND PLENTY OF EVERYTHING AND ONLY FLED WHEN THEY SAW US COMING

6531-61334-0001 TERRIFIED BY THE VOICE AND THE FEROCIOUS APPEARANCE OF THE HEROES THE SHEPHERD RETREATS HURRIEDLY LOCKING THE DOOR BEHIND HIM
6531-61334-0002 SHALMANESER SHAMASH ADAD ASHUR DAN
6531-61334-0003 THE SYRO CAPPADOCIAN HITTITES HAD GROWN ONCE AGAIN POWERFUL AND PROSPEROUS BUT NO GREAT LEADER LIKE SUBBILULIUMA AROSE TO WELD THE VARIOUS STATES INTO AN EMPIRE
6531-61334-0004 SO AS TO ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF THE MINGLED PEOPLES FROM THE OPERATIONS OF THE AGGRESSIVE AND AMBITIOUS WAR LORDS OF ASSYRIA ONE KINGDOM HAD ITS CAPITAL AT HAMATH AND ANOTHER AT CARCHEMISH ON THE EUPHRATES THE KINGDOM OF TABAL FLOURISHED IN CILICIA KHILAKKU
6531-61334-0005 IT INCLUDED SEVERAL CITY STATES LIKE TARSUS TIANA AND COMANA KAMMANU FARTHER WEST WAS THE DOMINION OF THE THRACO PHRYGIAN MUSKI THE TRIBES ROUND THE SHORES OF LAKE VAN
6531-61334-0006 HAD ASSERTED THEMSELVES AND EXTENDED THEIR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE THE STATE OF URARTU WAS OF GROWING IMPORTANCE AND THE NAIRI TRIBES HAD SPREAD ROUND THE SOUTH EASTERN SHORES OF LAKE VAN
6531-61334-0007 THE NORTHERN FRONTIER OF ASSYRIA WAS CONTINUALLY MENACED BY GROUPS OF INDEPENDENT HILL STATES WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN IRRESISTIBLE HAD THEY OPERATED TOGETHER AGAINST A COMMON ENEMY BUT WERE LIABLE TO BE EXTINGUISHED WHEN ATTACKED IN DETAIL
6531-61334-0008 A NUMBER OF ARAMAEAN KINGDOMS HAD COME INTO EXISTENCE IN MESOPOTAMIA AND THROUGHOUT SYRIA
6531-61334-0009 WHEN ASHUR NATSIR PAL THE THIRD
6531-61334-0010 GROUPS OF THE ARAMAEANS HAD ACQUIRED A HIGH DEGREE OF CULTURE AND BECOME TRADERS AND ARTISANS
6531-61334-0011 ACCUSTOMED FOR GENERATIONS TO DESERT WARFARE THEY WERE FEARLESS WARRIORS THEIR ARMIES HAD GREAT MOBILITY BEING COMPOSED MOSTLY OF MOUNTED INFANTRY AND WERE NOT EASILY OVERPOWERED BY THE ASSYRIAN FORCES OF FOOTMEN
6531-61334-0012 THE FORMER HAD RAIDED NORTH SYRIA AND APPARENTLY PENETRATED AS FAR AS THE MEDITERRANEAN COAST IN CONSEQUENCE HE CAME INTO CONFLICT WITH BABYLONIA BUT HE ULTIMATELY FORMED AN ALLIANCE WITH THAT KINGDOM HIS SON TUKULTI NINIP
6531-61334-0013 OPERATED IN SOUTHERN MESOPOTAMIA
6531-61334-0014 IN THE NORTH HE HAD TO DRIVE BACK INVADING BANDS OF THE MUSKI
6531-61334-0015 A SURE INDICATION THAT ASSYRIA WAS ONCE AGAIN BECOMING POWERFUL IN NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA AND THE REGIONS TOWARDS ARMENIA ASHUR NATSIR PAL THE THIRD
6531-61334-0016 INAUGURATED A VERITABLE REIGN OF TERROR IN MESOPOTAMIA AND NORTHERN SYRIA HIS METHODS OF DEALING WITH REVOLTING TRIBES WERE OF A MOST SAVAGE CHARACTER CHIEFS WERE SKINNED ALIVE AND WHEN HE SACKED THEIR CITIES
6531-61334-0017 NOT ONLY FIGHTING MEN BUT WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE EITHER SLAUGHTERED OR BURNED AT THE STAKE IT IS NOT SURPRISING TO FIND THEREFORE THAT ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION THE KINGS OF PETTY STATES MADE SUBMISSION TO HIM WITHOUT RESISTANCE AS SOON AS HE INVADED THEIR DOMAINS
6531-61334-0018 IN HIS FIRST YEAR HE OVERRAN THE MOUNTAINOUS DISTRICT BETWEEN LAKE VAN AND THE UPPER SOURCES OF THE TIGRIS BUBU THE REBEL SON OF THE GOVERNOR OF NISHTUN WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN PRISONER WAS TRANSPORTED TO ARBELA WHERE HE WAS SKINNED ALIVE
6531-61334-0019 LIKE HIS FATHER ASHUR NATSIR PAL FOUGHT AGAINST THE MUSKI WHOSE POWER WAS DECLINING THEN HE TURNED SOUTHWARD FROM THE BORDERS OF ASIA MINOR AND DEALT WITH A REBELLION IN NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA AN ARAMAEAN PRETENDER NAMED AKHIABABA
6531-61334-0020 HAD ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AT SURU IN THE REGION TO THE EAST OF THE EUPHRATES ENCLOSED BY ITS TRIBUTARIES THE KHABAR AND THE BALIKH HE HAD COME FROM THE NEIGHBOURING ARAMAEAN STATE OF BIT ADINI AND WAS PREPARING IT WOULD APPEAR
6531-61334-0021 TO FORM A POWERFUL CONFEDERACY AGAINST THE ASSYRIANS WHEN ASHUR NATSIR PAL APPROACHED SURU A PART OF ITS POPULATION WELCOMED HIM HE ENTERED THE CITY SEIZED THE PRETENDER AND MANY OF HIS FOLLOWERS
6531-61334-0022 THESE HE DISPOSED OF WITH CHARACTERISTIC BARBARITY SOME WERE SKINNED ALIVE AND SOME IMPALED ON STAKES WHILE OTHERS WERE ENCLOSED IN A PILLAR WHICH THE KING HAD ERECTED TO REMIND THE ARAMAEANS OF HIS DETERMINATION TO BROOK NO OPPOSITION
6531-61334-0023 AND WHEN THEY HAD BEEN FLAYED THEIR SKINS WERE NAILED UPON THE CITY WALLS ANOTHER REVOLT BROKE OUT IN THE KIRKHI DISTRICT BETWEEN THE UPPER REACHES OF THE TIGRIS AND THE SOUTHWESTERN SHORES OF LAKE VAN
6531-61334-0024 IT WAS PROMOTED BY THE NAIRI TRIBES AND EVEN SUPPORTED BY SOME ASSYRIAN OFFICIALS TERRIBLE REPRISALS WERE METED OUT TO THE REBELS WHEN THE CITY OF KINABU WAS CAPTURED NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND PRISONERS WERE BURNED ALIVE
6531-61334-0025 THE UNFAITHFUL GOVERNOR BEING FLAYED THE CITY OF DAMDAMUSA WAS SET ON FIRE THEN TELA WAS ATTACKED ASHUR NATSIR PAL'S OWN ACCOUNT OF THE OPERATIONS RUNS AS FOLLOWS
6531-61334-0026 THE CITY OF TELLO WAS VERY STRONG
6531-61334-0027 THEY DID NOT COME DOWN OR EMBRACE MY FEET WITH BATTLE AND SLAUGHTER I ASSAULTED AND TOOK THE CITY THREE THOUSAND WARRIORS I SLEW IN BATTLE THEIR BOOTY AND POSSESSIONS CATTLE SHEEP I CARRIED AWAY
6531-61334-0028 MANY CAPTIVES I BURNED WITH FIRE MANY OF THEIR SOLDIERS I TOOK ALIVE OF SOME I CUT OFF HANDS AND LIMBS OF OTHERS THE NOSES EARS AND ARMS OF MANY SOLDIERS I PUT OUT THE EYES
6531-61334-0029 I REARED A COLUMN OF THE LIVING AND A COLUMN OF HEADS I HUNG ON HIGH THEIR HEADS ON TREES IN THE VICINITY OF THEIR CITY THEIR BOYS AND GIRLS I BURNED UP IN FLAMES I DEVASTATED THE CITY DUG IT UP IN FIRE BURNED IT
6531-61334-0030 HE WAS SO GREATLY FEARED BY THE SYRO CAPPADOCIAN HITTITES THAT WHEN HE APPROACHED THEIR TERRITORY THEY SENT HIM TRIBUTE YIELDING WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
6531-61334-0031 FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE GREAT CONQUEROR ENGAGED HIMSELF IN THUS SUBDUING REBELLIOUS TRIBES AND EXTENDING HIS TERRITORY HIS MILITARY HEADQUARTERS WERE AT KALKHI TO WHICH CITY THE COURT HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED
6531-61334-0032 THITHER HE DRAFTED THOUSANDS OF PRISONERS THE GREAT MAJORITY OF WHOM HE INCORPORATED IN THE ASSYRIAN ARMY ASSYRIAN COLONIES WERE ESTABLISHED IN VARIOUS DISTRICTS FOR STRATEGICAL PURPOSES AND OFFICIALS SUPPLANTED THE PETTY KINGS IN CERTAIN OF THE NORTHERN CITY STATES
6531-61334-0033 THE ARAMAEANS OF MESOPOTAMIA GAVE MUCH TROUBLE TO ASHUR NATSIR PAL ALTHOUGH HE HAD LAID A HEAVY HAND ON SURU THE SOUTHERN TRIBES THE SUKHI STIRRED UP REVOLTS IN MESOPOTAMIA AS THE ALLIES OF THE BABYLONIANS
6531-61334-0034 ON ONE OCCASION ASHUR NATSIR PAL SWEPT SOUTHWARD THROUGH THIS REGION AND ATTACKED A COMBINED FORCE OF SUKHI ARAMAEANS AND BABYLONIANS THE BABYLONIANS WERE COMMANDED BY ZABDANU
6531-61334-0035 WHO WAS EVIDENTLY ANXIOUS TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE WESTERN TRADE ROUTE THE ASSYRIAN WAR LORD HOWEVER PROVED TO BE TOO POWERFUL A RIVAL HE ACHIEVED SO COMPLETE A VICTORY
6531-61334-0036 THE PEOPLE OF KASHSHI BABYLONIA AND KALDU CHALDAEA WERE STRICKEN WITH TERROR AND HAD TO AGREE TO PAY INCREASED TRIBUTE
6531-61334-0037 REIGNED FOR ABOUT A QUARTER OF A CENTURY
6531-61334-0038 HAVING ACCUMULATED GREAT BOOTY HE ENGAGED HIMSELF AS SOON AS PEACE WAS SECURED THROUGHOUT HIS EMPIRE IN REBUILDING THE CITY OF KALKHI WHERE HE ERECTED A GREAT PALACE AND MADE RECORDS OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS
6531-61334-0039 HE ALSO EXTENDED AND REDECORATED THE ROYAL PALACE AT NINEVEH AND DEVOTED MUCH ATTENTION TO THE TEMPLES TRIBUTE POURED IN FROM THE SUBJECT STATES THE MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY TRIBES IN THE NORTH FURNISHED IN ABUNDANCE WINE AND CORN
6531-61334-0040 SHEEP AND CATTLE AND HORSES AND FROM THE ARAMAEANS OF MESOPOTAMIA AND THE SYRO CAPPADOCIAN HITTITES CAME MUCH SILVER AND GOLD COPPER AND LEAD JEWELS AND IVORY AS WELL AS RICHLY DECORATED FURNITURE ARMOUR AND WEAPONS
6531-61334-0041 ARTISTS AND ARTISANS WERE ALSO PROVIDED BY THE VASSALS OF ASSYRIA THERE ARE TRACES OF PHOENICIAN INFLUENCE IN THE ART OF THIS PERIOD ASHUR NATSIR PAL'S GREAT PALACE AT KALKHI WAS EXCAVATED BY LAYARD
6531-61334-0042 WHO HAS GIVEN A VIVID DESCRIPTION OF THE VERDANT PLAIN ON WHICH THE ANCIENT CITY WAS SITUATED AS IT APPEARED IN SPRING ITS PASTURE LANDS KNOWN AS THE JAIF ARE RENOWNED HE WROTE
6531-61334-0043 IN THE EVENING AFTER THE LABOUR OF THE DAY I OFTEN SAT AT THE DOOR OF MY TENT GIVING MYSELF UP TO THE FULL ENJOYMENT OF THAT CALM AND REPOSE WHICH ARE IMPARTED TO THE SENSES BY SUCH SCENES AS THESE
6531-61334-0044 AS THE SUN WENT DOWN BEHIND THE LOW HILLS WHICH SEPARATE THE RIVER FROM THE DESERT EVEN THEIR ROCKY SIDES HAD STRUGGLED TO EMULATE THE VERDANT CLOTHING OF THE PLAIN ITS RECEDING RAYS WERE GRADUALLY WITHDRAWN
6531-61334-0045 LIKE A TRANSPARENT VEIL OF LIGHT FROM THE LANDSCAPE OVER THE PURE CLOUDLESS SKY WAS THE GLOW OF THE LAST LIGHT
6531-61334-0046 KESHAF ANOTHER VENERABLE RUIN ROSE INDISTINCTLY INTO THE EVENING MIST STILL MORE DISTANT AND STILL MORE INDISTINCT WAS A SOLITARY HILL OVERLOOKING THE ANCIENT CITY OF ARBELA
6531-61334-0047 THE KURDISH MOUNTAINS WHOSE SNOWY SUMMITS CHERISHED THE DYING SUNBEAMS YET STRUGGLED WITH THE TWILIGHT THE BLEATING OF SHEEP AND LOWING OF CATTLE
6531-61334-0048 AT FIRST FAINT BECAME LOUDER AS THE FLOCKS RETURNED FROM THEIR PASTURES AND WANDERED AMONGST THE TENTS GIRLS HURRIED OVER THE GREENSWARD TO SEEK THEIR FATHERS CATTLE OR CROUCHED DOWN TO MILK THOSE WHICH HAD RETURNED ALONE TO THEIR WELL REMEMBERED FOLDS
6531-61334-0049 BALES OF EMBROIDERED CLOTH IVORY AND JEWELS SILVER AND GOLD THE PRODUCTS OF MANY COUNTRIES WHILE THOUSANDS OF PRISONERS WERE ASSEMBLED THERE TO REAR STATELY BUILDINGS WHICH ULTIMATELY FELL INTO DECAY AND WERE BURIED BY DRIFTING SANDS
6531-61334-0050 LAYARD EXCAVATED THE EMPEROR'S PALACE AND DISPATCHED TO LONDON AMONG OTHER TREASURES OF ANTIQUITY
6531-61334-0051 THE ASSYRIAN SCULPTURES OF THIS PERIOD LACK THE TECHNICAL SKILL THE DELICACY AND IMAGINATION OF SUMERIAN AND AKKADIAN ART BUT THEY ARE FULL OF ENERGY DIGNIFIED AND MASSIVE AND STRONG AND LIFELIKE
6531-61334-0052 THEY REFLECT THE SPIRIT OF ASSYRIA'S GREATNESS WHICH HOWEVER HAD A MATERIALISTIC BASIS ASSYRIAN ART FOUND EXPRESSION IN DELINEATING THE OUTWARD FORM RATHER THAN IN STRIVING TO CREATE A THING OF BEAUTY WHICH IS A JOY FOR EVER
6531-61334-0053 WHEN ASHUR NATSIR PAL DIED
6531-61334-0054 WHOSE MILITARY ACTIVITIES EXTENDED OVER HIS WHOLE REIGN
6531-61334-0055 AS SHALMANESER WAS THE FIRST ASSYRIAN KING WHO CAME INTO DIRECT TOUCH WITH THE HEBREWS IT WILL BE OF INTEREST HERE TO REVIEW THE HISTORY OF THE DIVIDED KINGDOMS OF ISRAEL AND JUDAH AS RECORDED IN THE BIBLE
6531-61334-0056 ESTABLISHED THE RELIGION OF THE CANAANITES AND MADE GODS AND MOLTEN IMAGES HE WAS CONDEMNED FOR HIS IDOLATRY BY THE PROPHET AHIJAH WHO DECLARED THE LORD SHALL SMITE ISRAEL AS A REED IS SHAKEN IN THE WATER
6531-61334-0057 AND HE SHALL ROOT UP ISRAEL OUT OF THIS GOOD LAND WHICH HE GAVE TO THEIR FATHERS AND SHALL SCATTER THEM BEYOND THE RIVER
6531-61334-0058 AND HIS PEOPLE SLEW THEM WITH A GREAT SLAUGHTER SO THERE FELL DOWN SLAIN IN ISRAEL FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHOSEN MEN THUS THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WERE BROUGHT UNDER AT THAT TIME AND THE CHILDREN OF JUDAH PREVAILED BECAUSE THEY RELIED UPON THE LORD GOD OF THEIR FATHERS
6531-61334-0059 AND ABIJAH PURSUED AFTER JEROBOAM AND TOOK CITIES FROM HIM BETHEL WITH THE TOWNS THEREOF AND JESHANAH WITH THE TOWNS THEREOF
6531-61334-0060 AND THEY BURIED HIM IN THE CITY OF DAVID
6531-61334-0061 IN HIS DAYS THE LAND WAS QUIET TEN YEARS
6531-61334-0062 FOR HE TOOK AWAY THE ALTARS OF THE STRANGE GODS AND THE HIGH PLACES AND BRAKE DOWN THE IMAGES AND CUT DOWN THE GROVES AND COMMANDED JUDAH TO SEEK THE LORD GOD OF THEIR FATHERS AND TO DO THE LAW AND THE COMMANDMENT
6531-61334-0063 ALSO HE TOOK AWAY OUT OF ALL THE CITIES OF JUDAH THE HIGH PLACES AND THE IMAGES
6531-61334-0064 HE PROCEEDED TO FORTIFY RAMAH A FEW MILES TO THE NORTH OF JERUSALEM
6531-61334-0065 AND APPARENTLY SUPPORTED THE REBELLIONS OF THE NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIAN KINGS
6531-61334-0066 AND THEREFORE UNABLE EITHER TO ASSERT ITS AUTHORITY IN JUDAH
6531-61334-0067 IN THE HOUR OF PERIL JUDAH SOUGHT THE AID OF THE KING OF DAMASCUS
6531-61334-0068 AND THE TREASURES OF THE KING'S HOUSE AND DELIVERED THEM INTO THE HAND OF HIS SERVANTS
6531-61334-0069 THE SON OF TABRIMON THE SON OF HEZION KING OF SYRIA THAT DWELT AT DAMASCUS SAYING THERE IS A LEAGUE BETWEEN ME AND THEE AND BETWEEN MY FATHER AND THY FATHER BEHOLD
6531-61334-0070 WHEN HE WAS MURDERED BY HIS SERVANT ZIMRI CAPTAIN OF HALF HIS CHARIOTS WHILE HE WAS DRINKING HIMSELF DRUNK IN THE HOUSE OF ARZA STEWARD OF HIS HOUSE IN TIRZAH
6531-61334-0071 ZIMRI'S REVOLT WAS SHORTLIVED HE REIGNED ONLY SEVEN DAYS IN TIRZAH THE ARMY WAS ENCAMPED AGAINST GIBBETHON WHICH BELONGED TO THE PHILISTINES AND THE PEOPLE THAT WERE ENCAMPED HEARD SAY
6531-61334-0072 ZIMRI HATH CONSPIRED AND HATH ALSO SLAIN THE KING WHEREFORE ALL ISRAEL MADE OMRI THE CAPTAIN OF THE HOST KING OVER ISRAEL THAT DAY IN THE CAMP AND OMRI WENT UP FROM GIBBETHON AND ALL ISRAEL WITH HIM
6531-61334-0073 AND AHAB DID EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD ABOVE ALL THAT WERE BEFORE HIM SO NOTORIOUS INDEED WERE FATHER AND SON THAT THE PROPHET MICAH DECLARED TO THE BACKSLIDERS OF HIS DAY FOR THE STATUTES OF OMRI ARE KEPT
6531-61334-0074 AND ALL THE WORKS OF THE HOUSE OF AHAB AND YE WALK IN THEIR COUNSEL
6531-61334-0075 BOAST HIMSELF AS HE THAT PUTTETH IT OFF
6531-61334-0076 TWO YEARS PREVIOUSLY HE HAD BROKEN THE POWER OF AKHUNI
6531-61334-0077 THE LEADER OF A STRONG CONFEDERACY OF PETTY STATES THEREAFTER THE ASSYRIAN MONARCH TURNED TOWARDS THE SOUTH WEST AND ATTACKED THE HITTITE STATE OF HAMATH
6531-61334-0078 THE VARIOUS RIVAL KINGDOMS OF SYRIA UNITED AGAINST HIM AND AN ARMY OF SEVENTY THOUSAND ALLIES ATTEMPTED TO THWART HIS PROGRESS AT QARQAR ON THE ORONTES ALTHOUGH SHALMANESER CLAIMED A VICTORY ON THIS OCCASION
6531-61334-0079 IT WAS OF NO GREAT ADVANTAGE TO HIM FOR HE WAS UNABLE TO FOLLOW IT UP
6531-61334-0080 OF DAMASCUS AND AHAB OF ISRAEL AKHABBU
6531-61334-0081 THE LATTER HAD A FORCE OF TEN THOUSAND MEN UNDER HIS COMMAND FOUR YEARS AFTER AHAB BEGAN TO REIGN
6531-61334-0082 HE TURNED NOT ASIDE FROM IT DOING THAT WHICH WAS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD NEVERTHELESS THE HIGH PLACES WERE NOT TAKEN AWAY
6531-61334-0083 DURING THIS PERIOD BUT IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE TWO KINGDOMS HAD BEEN DRAWN TOGETHER
6531-61334-0084 AFTER REPULSING THE SYRIAN ALLIES AT QARQAR
6531-61334-0085 SHALMANESER THE THIRD OF ASSYRIA FOUND IT NECESSARY TO INVADE BABYLONIA
6531-61334-0086 OF THAT KINGDOM AND WAS THUS ABLE TO OPERATE IN THE NORTH WEST WITHOUT FEAR OF COMPLICATIONS WITH THE RIVAL CLAIMANT OF MESOPOTAMIA
6531-61334-0087 WERE RIVALS FOR THE THRONE THE FORMER THE RIGHTFUL HEIR APPEALED FOR HELP TO SHALMANESER AND THAT MONARCH AT ONCE HASTENED TO ASSERT HIS AUTHORITY IN THE SOUTHERN KINGDOM
6531-61334-0088 WAS SUPPORTED BY AN ARAMAEAN ARMY WAS DEFEATED AND PUT TO DEATH
6531-61334-0089 AFTERWARDS REIGNED OVER BABYLONIA AS THE VASSAL OF ASSYRIA AND SHALMANESER HIS OVERLORD MADE OFFERINGS TO THE GODS AT BABYLON BORSIPPA AND CUTHAH
6531-61334-0090 AND COMPELLED TO PAY ANNUAL TRIBUTE IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR SHALMANESER HAD TO LEAD AN EXPEDITION INTO NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA AND SUPPRESS A FRESH REVOLT IN THAT TROUBLED REGION BUT THE WESTERN ALLIES SOON GATHERED STRENGTH AGAIN
6531-61334-0091 HE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO RETURN WITH A GREAT ARMY BUT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING ANY PERMANENT SUCCESS ALTHOUGH HE PUT HIS ENEMIES TO FLIGHT THE VARIOUS WESTERN KINGDOMS INCLUDING DAMASCUS ISRAEL
6531-61334-0092 REMAINED UNCONQUERED AND CONTINUED TO CONSPIRE AGAINST HIM THE RESISTING POWER OF THE SYRIAN ALLIES HOWEVER WAS BEING GREATLY WEAKENED BY INTERNAL REVOLTS WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN STIRRED UP BY ASSYRIAN EMISSARIES
6531-61334-0093 A ROYAL PRINCESS OF ISRAEL WAS DEAD
6531-61334-0094 THUS SAITH THE LORD I HAVE ANOINTED THEE KING OVER ISRAEL AND THOU SHALT SMITE THE HOUSE OF AHAB THY MASTER THAT I MAY AVENGE THE BLOOD OF MY SERVANTS THE PROPHETS AND THE BLOOD OF ALL THE SERVANTS OF THE LORD
6531-61334-0095 JEHU CONSPIRED AGAINST JORAM AND THEN ACCOMPANIED BY AN ESCORT
6531-61334-0096 SO THAT HE MIGHT BE THE FIRST TO ANNOUNCE THE REVOLT TO THE KING WHOM HE WAS TO DEPOSE THE WATCHMAN ON THE TOWER OF JEZREEL SAW JEHU AND HIS COMPANY APPROACHING
6531-61334-0097 AND INFORMED JORAM WHO TWICE SENT OUT A MESSENGER TO ENQUIRE IS IT PEACE NEITHER MESSENGER RETURNED AND THE WATCHMAN INFORMED THE WOUNDED MONARCH OF ISRAEL HE CAME EVEN UNTO THEM AND COMETH NOT AGAIN
6531-61334-0098 AND THE DRIVING IS LIKE THE DRIVING OF JEHU THE SON OF NIMSHI FOR HE DRIVETH FURIOUSLY KING JORAM WENT OUT HIMSELF TO MEET THE FAMOUS CHARIOTEER
6531-61334-0099 WHERE HE WAS WELCOMED HE MADE OFFERINGS THERE TO HADAD THE LOCAL THOR AND THEN SUDDENLY MARCHED SOUTHWARD HAZAEL WENT OUT TO OPPOSE THE ADVANCING ASSYRIANS AND CAME INTO CONFLICT WITH THEM IN THE VICINITY OF MOUNT HERMON
6531-61334-0100 I FOUGHT WITH HIM SHALMANESER RECORDED AND ACCOMPLISHED HIS DEFEAT
6531-61334-0101 HE FLED TO SAVE HIS LIFE HAZAEL TOOK REFUGE WITHIN THE WALLS OF DAMASCUS WHICH THE ASSYRIANS BESIEGED BUT FAILED HOWEVER TO CAPTURE SHALMANESER'S SOLDIERS MEANWHILE WASTED AND BURNED CITIES WITHOUT NUMBER
6531-61334-0102 AND CARRIED AWAY GREAT BOOTY IN THOSE DAYS SHALMANESER RECORDED I RECEIVED TRIBUTE FROM THE TYRIANS AND SIDONIANS AND FROM YAUA JEHU
6531-61334-0103 SHOWS THAT THE UNPRONOUNCED ALEPH AT THE END WAS AT THAT TIME SOUNDED
6531-61334-0104 JEHUA SHALMANESER DID NOT AGAIN ATTACK DAMASCUS HIS SPHERE OF INFLUENCE WAS THEREFORE CONFINED TO NORTH SYRIA
6531-61334-0105 HIS REVOLT RECEIVED THE SUPPORT OF THE ORTHODOX HEBREWS AND HE BEGAN WELL BY INAUGURATING REFORMS IN THE NORTHERN KINGDOM WITH PURPOSE APPARENTLY TO RE ESTABLISH THE WORSHIP OF DAVID'S GOD HE PERSECUTED THE PROPHETS OF BAAL BUT SOON BECAME A BACKSLIDER
6531-61334-0106 FOR ALTHOUGH HE STAMPED OUT THE PHOENICIAN RELIGION HE BEGAN TO WORSHIP THE GOLDEN CALVES THAT WERE IN BETHEL AND THAT WERE IN DAN
6531-61334-0107 OF THE IDOLATORS OF THE ANCIENT CULT OF THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN THE CROWN OF JUDAH HAD BEEN SEIZED BY THE ISRAELITISH QUEEN MOTHER
6531-61334-0108 BUT ANOTHER WOMAN THWARTED THE COMPLETION OF HER MONSTROUS DESIGN
6531-61334-0109 THE KING'S SON AND PUT UPON HIM THE CROWN AND GAVE HIM THE TESTIMONY AND MADE HIM KING AND JEHOIADA AND HIS SONS ANOINTED HIM AND SAID GOD SAVE THE KING
6531-61334-0110 SHE CAME TO THE PEOPLE INTO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND SHE LOOKED AND BEHOLD THE KING STOOD AT HIS PILLAR AT THE ENTERING IN AND THE PRINCES AND THE TRUMPETS BY THE KING AND ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND REJOICED AND SOUNDED WITH TRUMPETS
6531-61334-0111 ALSO THE SINGERS WITH INSTRUMENTS OF MUSICK AND SUCH AS TAUGHT TO SING PRAISE
6531-61334-0112 AND SAID TREASON TREASON THEN JEHOIADA THE PRIEST BROUGHT OUT THE CAPTAINS OF HUNDREDS THAT WERE SET OVER THE HOST
6531-61334-0113 HAVE HER FORTH OF THE RANGES AND WHOSO FOLLOWETH HER LET HIM BE SLAIN BY THE SWORD FOR THE PRIEST SAID SLAY HER NOT IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD SO THEY LAID HANDS ON HER
6531-61334-0114 AND WHEN SHE WAS COME TO THE ENTERING OF THE HORSE GATE BY THE KING'S HOUSE THEY SLEW HER THERE AND JEHOIADA MADE A COVENANT BETWEEN HIM AND BETWEEN ALL THE PEOPLE
6531-61334-0115 AND HE DELIVERED THEM INTO THE HAND OF BEN HADAD THE SON OF HAZAEL ALL THEIR DAYS THEN JEHOAHAZ REPENTED HE BESOUGHT THE LORD AND THE LORD HEARKENED UNTO HIM FOR HE SAW THE OPPRESSION OF ISRAEL
6531-61334-0116 AND KEPT HIS GENERALS CONTINUALLY EMPLOYED SUPPRESSING REVOLTS ON HIS FRONTIERS AFTER HE SUBDUED THE HITTITES
6531-61334-0117 TRIBES OF THE MEDES CAME UNDER HIS POWER
6531-61334-0118 LIKE THE FRONTIER TRIBES OF INDIA AGAINST THE BRITISH TROOPS THE KINGDOM OF URARTU WAS GROWING MORE AND MORE POWERFUL
6531-61334-0119 THE GREAT EMPIRE WAS SUDDENLY SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS BY THE OUTBREAK OF CIVIL WAR THE PARTY OF REBELLION WAS LED BY SHALMANESER'S SON ASHUR DANIN APLI
6531-61334-0120 HE WAS A POPULAR HERO AND RECEIVED THE SUPPORT OF MOST OF THE IMPORTANT ASSYRIAN CITIES INCLUDING NINEVEH
6531-61334-0121 ARBELA IMGURBEL AND DUR BALAT AS WELL AS SOME OF THE DEPENDENCIES SHALMANESER RETAINED KALKHI AND THE PROVINCES OF NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA AND IT APPEARS THAT THE GREATER PART OF THE ARMY ALSO REMAINED LOYAL TO HIM
6531-61334-0122 AFTER FOUR YEARS OF CIVIL WAR SHALMANESER DIED HIS CHOSEN HEIR
6531-61334-0123 WHEN AT LENGTH THE NEW KING HAD STAMPED OUT THE LAST EMBERS OF REVOLT WITHIN THE KINGDOM HE HAD TO UNDERTAKE THE RECONQUEST OF THOSE PROVINCES WHICH IN THE INTERVAL
6531-61334-0124 URARTU IN THE NORTH HAD GROWN MORE AGGRESSIVE THE SYRIANS WERE OPENLY DEFIANT THE MEDES WERE CONDUCTING BOLD RAIDS
6531-61334-0125 SHAMSHI ADAD HOWEVER
6531-61334-0126 BURNED MANY CITIES AND COLLECTED ENORMOUS TRIBUTE WHILE THOUSANDS OF PRISONERS WERE TAKEN AND FORCED TO SERVE THE CONQUEROR HAVING ESTABLISHED HIS POWER IN THE NORTH SHAMSHI ADAD
6531-61334-0127 ON HIS WAY SOUTHWARD HE SUBDUED MANY VILLAGES
6531-61334-0128 AND ACHIEVED A GREAT VICTORY KILLING THIRTEEN THOUSAND AND TAKING THREE THOUSAND CAPTIVES THEN THE BABYLONIAN KING
6531-61334-0129 BUT WAS DEFEATED IN A FIERCE BATTLE ON THE BANKS OF THE DABAN CANAL
6531-61334-0130 TWO HUNDRED HORSEMEN AND ONE HUNDRED CHARIOTS SHAMSHI ADAD CONDUCTED IN ALL FIVE CAMPAIGNS IN BABYLONIA AND CHALDAEA WHICH HE COMPLETELY SUBDUED PENETRATING AS FAR AS THE SHORES OF THE PERSIAN GULF
6531-61334-0131 IN THE END HE TOOK PRISONER THE NEW KING
6531-61334-0132 FOR OVER HALF A CENTURY AFTER THIS DISASTER BABYLONIA WAS A PROVINCE OF ASSYRIA
6563-285357-0000 THIS IMPERIAL APPRECIATION OF WHAT HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED PROVED TO BE THE TURNING POINT IN THE INVENTOR'S FORTUNES IT STIMULATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND THE SECOND AIRSHIP WAS TAKEN IN HAND BUT MISFORTUNE STILL PURSUED HIM
6563-285357-0001 ACCIDENTS WERE OF ALMOST DAILY OCCURRENCE DEFECTS WERE REVEALED HERE AND WEAKNESSES SOMEWHERE ELSE SO SOON AS ONE TROUBLE WAS OVERCOME ANOTHER MADE ITSELF MANIFEST THE RESULT WAS THAT THE WHOLE OF THE MONEY COLLECTED BY HIS HARD WORK
6563-285357-0002 WAS EXPENDED BEFORE THE SHIP COULD TAKE TO THE AIR A FURTHER CRASH AND BLASTING OF CHERISHED HOPES APPEARED IMMINENT BUT AT THIS MOMENT ANOTHER ROYAL PERSONAGE CAME TO THE INVENTOR'S AID THE KING OF WURTEMBERG
6563-285357-0003 TOOK A PERSONAL INTEREST IN HIS SUBJECT'S UPHILL STRUGGLE AND THE WURTEMBERG GOVERNMENT GRANTED HIM THE PROCEEDS OF A LOTTERY WITH THIS MONEY AND WITH WHAT HE SUCCEEDED IN RAISING BY HOOK AND BY CROOK AND BY MORTGAGING HIS REMAINING PROPERTY
6563-285357-0004 AND IN NINETEEN O FIVE IT WAS LAUNCHED IT WAS A DISTINCT IMPROVEMENT UPON ITS PREDECESSORS THE AIRSHIP WAS FOUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN FEET IN LENGTH BY THIRTY EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER WAS EQUIPPED WITH SEVENTEEN GAS BALLOONS
6563-285357-0005 HAVING AN AGGREGATE CAPACITY OF THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND CUBIC FEET OF HYDROGEN WAS EQUIPPED WITH TWO EIGHTY FIVE HORSE POWER MOTORS DRIVING FOUR PROPELLERS AND DISPLACED NINE TONS ALL THE IMPERFECTIONS INCIDENTAL TO THE PREVIOUS CRAFT
6563-285357-0006 HAD BEEN ELIMINATED WHILE THE SHIP FOLLOWED IMPROVED LINES IN ITS MECHANICAL AND STRUCTURAL DETAILS THE TRIALS WITH THIS VESSEL COMMENCED ON NOVEMBER THIRTIETH NINETEEN O FIVE BUT ILL LUCK HAD NOT BEEN ELUDED
6563-285357-0007 THE AIRSHIP WAS MOORED UPON A RAFT WHICH WAS TO BE TOWED OUT INTO THE LAKE TO ENABLE THE DIRIGIBLE TO ASCEND BUT SOMETHING WENT WRONG WITH THE ARRANGEMENTS A STRONG WIND CAUGHT THE UNGAINLY AIRSHIP SHE DIPPED HER NOSE INTO THE WATER AND AS THE MOTOR WAS SET GOING
6563-285357-0008 SHE WAS DRIVEN DEEPER INTO THE LAKE THE VESSEL ONLY BEING SAVED BY HURRIED DEFLATION SIX WEEKS WERE OCCUPIED IN REPAIRS BUT ANOTHER ASCENT WAS MADE ON JANUARY SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN O SIX THE TRIALS WERE FAIRLY SATISFACTORY
6563-285357-0009 BUT INCONCLUSIVE ONE OF THE MOTORS WENT WRONG AND THE LONGITUDINAL STABILITY WAS FOUND TO BE INDIFFERENT THE VESSEL WAS BROUGHT DOWN AND WAS TO BE ANCHORED BUT THE FATES RULED OTHERWISE A STRONG WIND CAUGHT HER DURING THE NIGHT
6563-285357-0010 AND SHE WAS SPEEDILY REDUCED TO INDISTINGUISHABLE SCRAP DESPITE CATASTROPHE THE INVENTOR WRESTLED GAMELY WITH HIS PROJECT THE LESSONS TAUGHT BY ONE DISASTER WERE TAKEN TO HEART
6563-285357-0011 AND ARRANGEMENTS TO PREVENT THE RECURRENCE THEREOF INCORPORATED IN THE SUCCEEDING CRAFT UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER AS SOON AS ONE DEFECT WAS REMEDIED ANOTHER ASSERTED ITSELF IT WAS THIS PERSISTENT REVELATION OF THE UNEXPECTED
6563-285357-0012 WHICH CAUSED ANOTHER PERIOD OF INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS HIS INVENTION PROBABLY NOTHING MORE WOULD HAVE BEEN HEARD OF THE ZEPPELIN AFTER THIS LAST ACCIDENT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE INTERVENTION OF THE PRUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AT THE DIRECT INSTIGATION OF THE KAISER
6563-285357-0013 WHO HAD NOW TAKEN COUNT ZEPPELIN UNDER HIS WING A STATE LOTTERY WAS INAUGURATED THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH WERE HANDED OVER TO THE INDEFATIGABLE INVENTOR TOGETHER WITH AN ASSURANCE THAT IF HE COULD KEEP ALOFT TWENTY FOUR HOURS WITHOUT COMING TO EARTH IN THE MEANTIME
6563-285357-0014 AND COULD COVER FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILES WITHIN THIS PERIOD THE GOVERNMENT WOULD REPAY THE WHOLE OF THE MONEY HE HAD LAVISHED UPON HIS IDEA AND LIQUIDATE ALL THE DEBTS HE HAD INCURRED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH ANOTHER CRAFT WAS BUILT LARGER THAN ITS PREDECESSORS
6563-285357-0015 AND EQUIPPED WITH TWO MOTORS DEVELOPING ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY HORSE POWER UPON COMPLETION IT WAS SUBMITTED TO SEVERAL PRELIMINARY FLIGHTS WHICH WERE SO EMINENTLY SUCCESSFUL THAT THE INVENTOR DECIDED TO MAKE A TRIAL TRIP UNDER CONDITIONS CLOSELY ANALOGOUS
6563-285357-0016 TO THOSE IMPOSED FOR THE GOVERNMENT TEST ON JUNE TWENTIETH NINETEEN O EIGHT AT EIGHT TWENTY SIX A M THE CRAFT ASCENDED AND REMAINED ALOFT FOR TWELVE HOURS DURING WHICH TIME IT MADE AN ENCOURAGING CIRCULAR TOUR FLUSHED WITH THIS SUCCESS
6563-285357-0017 THE COUNT CONSIDERED THAT THE OFFICIAL AWARD WAS WITHIN REACH AND THAT ALL HIS PREVIOUS DISASTERS AND MISFORTUNES WERE ON THE EVE OF REDEMPTION THE CRUCIAL TEST WAS ESSAYED ON AUGUST FIFTH NINETEEN O EIGHT ACCOMPANIED BY TWELVE OBSERVERS
6563-285357-0018 THE VESSEL ASCENDED AND TRAVELLED WITHOUT INCIDENT FOR EIGHT HOURS THEN A SLIGHT MISHAP DEMANDED ATTENTION BUT WAS SPEEDILY REPAIRED AND WAS IGNORED OFFICIALLY AS BEING TOO TRIVIAL TO INFLUENCE THE MAIN ISSUE VICTORY APPEARED WITHIN
6563-285357-0019 MEASURABLE DISTANCE THE ARDUOUS TOIL OF MANY PATIENT YEARS WAS ABOUT TO BE REWARDED THE AIRSHIP WAS WITHIN SIGHT OF HOME WHEN IT HAD TO DESCEND OWING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANOTHER MOTOR FAULT BUT AS IT APPROACHED THE GROUND NATURE
6563-285357-0020 AS IF INFURIATED AT THE CONQUEST ROSE UP IN REBELLION A SUDDEN SQUALL STRUCK THE UNWIELDY MONSTER WITHIN A FEW MOMENTS IT BECAME UNMANAGEABLE AND THROUGH SOME INSCRUTABLE CAUSE IT CAUGHT FIRE WITH THE RESULT THAT WITHIN A FEW MOMENTS
6563-285357-0021 IT WAS REDUCED TO A TANGLED MASS OF METALLIC FRAMEWORK IT WAS A CATASTROPHE THAT WOULD HAVE COMPLETELY VANQUISHED MANY AN INVENTOR BUT THE COUNT WAS SAVED THE GALL OF DEFEAT HIS FLIGHT WHICH WAS REMARKABLE INASMUCH AS HE HAD COVERED THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILES
6563-285357-0022 WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS INCLUDING TWO UNAVOIDABLE DESCENTS STRUCK THE TEUTON IMAGINATION THE SEEDS SO CAREFULLY PLANTED BY THE MOST HIGH OF PRUSSIA NOW BORE FRUIT THE GERMAN NATION SYMPATHISED WITH THE INDOMITABLE INVENTOR
6563-285357-0023 APPRECIATED HIS GENIUS AND PROMPTLY POURED FORTH A STREAM OF SUBSCRIPTIONS TO ENABLE HIM TO BUILD ANOTHER VESSEL THE INTIMATION THAT OTHER POWERS HAD APPROACHED THE COUNT FOR THE ACQUISITION OF HIS IDEA BECAME KNOWN FAR AND WIDE
6563-285357-0024 TOGETHER WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HE HAD UNEQUIVOCALLY REFUSED ALL OFFERS HE WAS STRIVING FOR THE FATHERLAND
6563-285357-0025 HE COULD FORGE AHEAD UNTRAMMELLED BY ANXIETY AND WORRY ANOTHER ZEPPELIN WAS BUILT AND IT CREATED A WORLD'S RECORD IT REMAINED ALOFT FOR THIRTY EIGHT HOURS DURING WHICH TIME IT COVERED SIX HUNDRED NINETY MILES AND ALTHOUGH IT CAME TO GRIEF UPON ALIGHTING
6563-285357-0026 BY COLLIDING WITH A TREE THE FINAL INCIDENT PASSED UNNOTICED
6563-285357-0027 IT HAD AN AIRSHIP WHICH COULD GO ANYWHERE IRRESPECTIVE OF CLIMATIC CONDITIONS AND IN TRUE TEUTON PERSPECTIVE THE CRAFT WAS VIEWED FROM THE MILITARY STANDPOINT HERE WAS A MEANS OF OBTAINING THE MASTERY OF THE AIR
6563-285357-0028 A FORMIDABLE ENGINE OF INVASION AND AERIAL ATTACK HAD BEEN PERFECTED CONSEQUENTLY THE GRAND IDEA MUST BE SUPPORTED WITH UNBOUNDED ENTHUSIASM THE COUNT WAS HAILED BY HIS AUGUST MASTER AS THE GREATEST GERMAN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
6563-285357-0029 AND IN THIS APPRECIATION THE POPULACE WHOLEHEARTEDLY CONCURRED WHETHER SUCH A PANEGYRIC FROM SUCH AN AUSPICIOUS QUARTER IS PRAISE INDEED OR THE EQUIVALENT OF COMPLETE CONDEMNATION HISTORY ALONE WILL BE ABLE TO JUDGE
6563-285357-0030 BUT WHEN ONE REFLECTS AT THIS MOMENT UPON THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS AIRCRAFT DURING THE PRESENT CONFLAGRATION THE UNPREJUDICED WILL BE RATHER INCLINED TO HAZARD THE OPINION THAT IMPERIAL TEUTON PRAISE IS A SYNONYM FOR DAMNATION
6563-285357-0031 ALTHOUGH THE ZEPPELIN WAS ACCEPTED AS A PERFECT MACHINE IT HAS NEVER BEEN POSSIBLE TO DISPERSE THE ATMOSPHERE OF DISASTER WITH WHICH IT HAS BEEN ENVELOPED FROM THE FIRST VESSEL AFTER VESSEL HAS GONE UP IN SMOKE AND FLAME FEW CRAFT OF THIS TYPE
6563-285357-0032 HAVE ENJOYED MORE THAN AN EVANESCENT EXISTENCE
6563-285357-0033 THAN ITS PREDECESSOR BUT THE TEUTONIC NATION HAS BEEN INDUCED TO PIN ITS WHOLE FAITH ON THIS AIRSHIP NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THE MORE LEVELHEADED ENGINEERS OF OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED THE CRAFT TO BE A MECHANICAL MONSTROSITY CONDEMNED FROM ITS DESIGN
6563-285357-0034 AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSTRUCTION TO DISASTER UNSHAKEN BY THIS ADVERSE CRITICISM GERMANY RESTS ASSURED THAT BY MEANS OF ITS ZEPPELINS IT WILL ACHIEVE THAT UNIVERSAL SUPREMACY WHICH IT IS CONVINCED IS ITS DESTINY
6563-285357-0035 THIS BLIND CHILD LIKE FAITH HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ZEPPELIN FACTORIES AT FRIEDRICHSHAFEN THE FACILITIES ARE ADEQUATE TO PRODUCE TWO OF THESE VESSELS PER MONTH WHILE ANOTHER FACTORY OF A SIMILAR CAPACITY
6563-285357-0036 HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AT BERLIN UNFORTUNATELY SUCH BIG CRAFT DEMAND LARGE DOCKS TO ACCOMMODATE THEM AND IN TURN A LARGE STRUCTURE OF THIS CHARACTER CONSTITUTES AN EASY MARK FOR HOSTILE ATTACK AS THE RAIDING AIRMEN OF THE ALLIES HAVE
6563-285357-0037 PROVED VERY CONVINCINGLY BUT THE ZEPPELIN MUST NOT BE UNDER RATED MAGNIFICENT PERFORMANCES HAVE BEEN RECORDED BY THESE VESSELS SUCH AS THE ROUND ONE THOUSAND MILES TRIP IN NINETEEN O NINE AND SEVERAL OTHER
6563-285357-0038 EQUALLY BRILLIANT FEATS SINCE THAT DATE IT IS QUITE TRUE THAT EACH ASTOUNDING ACHIEVEMENT HAS BEEN ATTENDED BY AN EQUALLY STUPENDOUS ACCIDENT BUT THAT IS ACCEPTED AS A MERE INCIDENTAL DETAIL BY THE FAITHFUL TEUTONIC NATION
6563-285357-0039 MANY VIVID PROPHECIES OF THE FORTHCOMING FLIGHTS BY ZEPPELIN HAVE BEEN UTTERED AND IT IS QUITE PROBABLE THAT MORE THAN ONE WILL BE FULFILLED BUT SUCCESS WILL BE ATTRIBUTABLE RATHER TO ACCIDENT THAN DESIGN
6563-285357-0040 ALTHOUGH THE ZEPPELIN IS THE MAIN STAKE OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE IN MATTERS PERTAINING TO AERIAL CONQUEST OTHER TYPES OF AIRSHIPS HAVE NOT BEEN IGNORED AS RELATED IN ANOTHER CHAPTER THEY HAVE BEEN FOSTERED UPON A SMALLER BUT EQUALLY EFFECTIVE SCALE
6563-285357-0041 GROSS CRAFT HAVE MET WITH WHOLE HEARTED SUPPORT SINCE THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED THEIR VALUE AS VESSELS OF THE AIR WHICH IS TANTAMOUNT TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF THEIR MILITARY VALUE THE PARSEVAL IS PRONOUNCED BY EXPERTS TO BE THE FINEST EXPRESSION OF AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERING
6563-285357-0042 SO FAR AS TEUTON EFFORT IS CONCERNED CERTAINLY IT HAS PLACED MANY NOTABLE FLIGHTS TO ITS CREDIT THE GROSS AIRSHIP IS AN EQUALLY SERVICEABLE CRAFT
6563-285357-0043 CLOSELY FOLLOWING THOSE OF THE EARLY FRENCH SUPPLE AIRSHIPS THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER CRAFT WHICH HAVE BECOME MORE OR LESS RECOGNISED BY THE GERMAN NATION AS SUBSTANTIAL UNITS OF WAR SUCH AS THE RUTHEMBERG SIEMENS SCHUKERT AND SO FORTH
6563-285357-0044 ALL OF WHICH HAVE PROVED THEIR SERVICEABILITY MORE OR LESS CONCLUSIVELY
6563-63821-0000 PETER FORCE ONE OF THE INTERESTING SIGHTS OF THE CITY OF WASHINGTON USED TO BE THE LIBRARY OF OLD PETER FORCE AS HE WAS FAMILIARLY CALLED COLONEL PETER FORCE AS HE WAS MORE PROPERLY STYLED
6563-63821-0001 HE WAS ONE OF THE FEW COLONELS OF THAT DAY WHO HAD ACTUALLY HELD A COLONEL'S COMMAND HAVING BEEN REGULARLY COMMISSIONED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AS A COLONEL OF ARTILLERY IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HE MIGHT INDEED HAVE BEEN CALLED MAJOR GENERAL
6563-63821-0002 FOR IN HIS OLD AGE HE HELD THAT RANK IN THE MILITIA OF THE DISTRICT AND A VERY FINE LOOKING SOLDIER HE MUST HAVE BEEN IN HIS PRIME JUDGING FROM THE PORTRAIT WHICH USED TO HANG IN THE LIBRARY REPRESENTING A FULL FORMED MAN TALL AND ERECT
6563-63821-0003 HIS HANDSOME AND BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE SET OFF BY AN ABUNDANCE OF CURLY HAIR HIS LIBRARY HAD ABOUT THE ROUGHEST FURNITURE EVER SEEN IN AN APARTMENT CONTAINING SO MUCH THAT WAS VALUABLE AS I REMEMBER IT IT WAS A LONG LOW ROOM
6563-63821-0004 WITH STREETS AND CROSS STREETS OF PINE BOOK SHELVES UNPAINTED ALL FILLED WITH BOOKS TO THEIR UTMOST CAPACITY A WILDERNESS OF BOOKS IN PRINT AND IN MANUSCRIPT MOSTLY OLD AND DINGY
6563-63821-0005 AND ALMOST ALL OF THEM RELATING IN SOME WAY TO AMERICAN HISTORY THE PLACE HAD A VERY MUSTY SMELL AND AS MOST OF ITS TREASURES WERE IN THE ORIGINAL BINDINGS OR WITHOUT BINDINGS FEW PERSONS WOULD HAVE SUSPECTED THE PRICELESS VALUE OF THE COLLECTION
6563-63821-0006 I AM ACQUAINTED WITH A CERTAIN LIBRARY IN NEW YORK OF SEVERAL THOUSAND VOLUMES MOST OF WHICH ARE BOUND RESPLENDENTLY IN CALF AND GOLD AND THE ROOM IN WHICH THEY ARE KEPT IS AS SPLENDID AS A STEAMBOAT
6563-63821-0007 BUT OLD PETER FORCE COULD SHOW YOU SINGLE ALCOVES OF HIS LIBRARY WHICH AT A FAIR VALUATION WOULD BUY OUT ALL THAT MASS OF SUMPTUOSITY IT WAS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO FIND THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN HIS DUSTY DINGY WILDERNESS
6563-63821-0008 HE WOULD TAKE PLEASURE IN EXHIBITING HIS TREASURES HE WOULD TAKE DOWN HIS EXCELLENT COPY OF ELIOT'S INDIAN BIBLE A BOOK SO FAITHFULLY MADE IN EVERY RESPECT THAT I QUESTION IF AS A MERE PIECE OF BOOK MAKING
6563-63821-0009 IT COULD NOW BE MATCHED IN THE UNITED STATES HE LIVED TO SEE THIS RARITY COMMAND IN NEW YORK THE PRICE OF FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS HE WOULD SHOW YOU FORTY ONE WORKS IN THE ORIGINAL EDITIONS OF INCREASE AND COTTON MATHER
6563-63821-0010 THE MOST RECENT OF WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN SEVENTEEN THIRTY FIVE HE POSSESSED A LARGE NUMBER OF BOOKS PRINTED AND BOUND BY BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HE HAD TWO HUNDRED VOLUMES OF THE RECORDS OF COLONIAL LEGISLATURES
6563-63821-0011 HE COULD SHOW YOU A NEWSPAPER OF ALMOST EVERY MONTH NAY ALMOST EVERY WEEK SINCE NEWSPAPERS WERE FIRST PUBLISHED IN AMERICA HE HAD IN ALL NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BOUND VOLUMES OF NEWSPAPERS OF WHICH TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE VOLUMES
6563-63821-0012 HE WOULD SHOW YOU A COLLECTION OF MORE THAN THIRTY NINE THOUSAND PAMPHLETS OF WHICH EIGHT THOUSAND WERE PRINTED BEFORE THE YEAR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HIS COLLECTION OF MAPS RELATING TO AMERICA WAS TRULY WONDERFUL BESIDES ALL THE EARLY ATLASES OF ANY NOTE
6563-63821-0013 HE HAD OVER A THOUSAND DETACHED MAPS ILLUSTRATIVE BOTH OF THE GEOGRAPHY AND HISTORY OF AMERICA FOR MANY OF THEM WERE MAPS AND PLANS DRAWN FOR MILITARY PURPOSES HE WOULD SHOW YOU PERHAPS
6563-63821-0014 A PEN DRAWING OF DATE SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE BY A BRITISH OFFICER UPON WHICH WAS WRITTEN PLAN OF THE REBEL WORKS AT WEST POINT HE HAD ALSO SEVERAL PLANS BY BRITISH OFFICERS OF THE REBEL WORKS AROUND BOSTON DURING THE REVOLUTION
6563-63821-0015 BESIDES SUCH THINGS AND HE HAD OVER THREE HUNDRED PLANS AND MAPS OF WHICH THERE WAS NO OTHER COPY IN EXISTENCE HE POSSESSED A SURPRISING NUMBER OF BOOKS PRINTED IN THE INFANCY OF THE PRINTER'S ART AMONG THEM
6563-63821-0016 SPECIMENS REPRESENTING EVERY YEAR FROM FOURTEEN SIXTY SEVEN ONWARD HE HAD MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BOOKS PRINTED BEFORE THE YEAR SIXTEEN HUNDRED SO ARRANGED THAT A STUDENT COULD TRACE THE PROGRESS OF THE ART OF PRINTING FROM THE DAYS OF CAXTON
6563-63821-0017 HE HAD ALSO A VAST COLLECTION OF MANUSCRIPTS NUMBERING FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE VOLUMES
6563-63821-0018 THE WHOLE NUMBER OF VOLUMES IN THE LIBRARY WAS TWENTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE AND THE NUMBER OF PAMPHLETS NEARLY FORTY THOUSAND THE READER PERHAPS IMAGINES THAT THE COLLECTOR OF SUCH A LIBRARY MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY RICH MAN
6563-63821-0019 AND THAT HE TRAVELED FAR AND WIDE IN SEARCH OF THESE PRECIOUS OBJECTS NOT AT ALL HE NEVER WAS A RICH MAN AND I BELIEVE HE RARELY TRAVELED BEYOND THE SIGHT OF THE DOME OF THE CAPITOL INDEED THE MOST WONDERFUL THING ABOUT HIS COLLECTION WAS THAT HE
6563-63821-0020 WHO BEGAN LIFE A JOURNEYMAN PRINTER AND WAS NEVER IN THE RECEIPT OF A LARGE INCOME SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET TOGETHER SO VAST AN AMOUNT OF VALUABLE MATERIAL PART OF THE SECRET WAS THAT WHEN HE BEGAN TO MAKE HIS COLLECTION THESE THINGS WERE NOT VALUED
6563-63821-0021 AND HE OBTAINED MANY OF HIS MOST PRECIOUS RELICS BY MERELY TAKING THE TROUBLE TO CARRY THEM AWAY FROM THE GARRETS IN WHICH THEY WERE MOULDERING INTO DUST UNPRIZED AND UNKNOWN A WISE OLD NEW YORK MERCHANT LONG AGO HIMSELF MOULDERED INTO DUST
6563-63821-0022 USED TO SAY MEN GENERALLY GET IN THIS WORLD EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT HOW CAN THAT BE ASKED A YOUNGSTER ONE DAY
6563-63821-0023 BUT VERY FEW OF THEM EVER WILL BE I WANT A MILLION OR SO MYSELF AH BOY THE OLD MAN REPLIED YOU WANT A MILLION BUT YOU DON'T WANT IT ENOUGH WHAT YOU WANT AT PRESENT IS PLEASURE AND YOU WANT IT SO MUCH
6563-63821-0024 THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO SPEND ALL YOUR SURPLUS FORCE TIME AND REVENUE TO GET IT IF YOU WANTED YOUR MILLION AS MUCH AS YOU WANT PLEASURE BY AND BY WHEN YOU HAVE A BALD HEAD LIKE MINE YOU WOULD HAVE YOUR MILLION
6563-63821-0025 PETER FORCE WAS A VERY GOOD ILLUSTRATION OF THE OLD MERCHANT'S DOCTRINE HE GOT ALL THESE PRECIOUS THINGS BECAUSE HE WANTED THEM WITH A SUSTAINED PASSION OF DESIRE FOR HALF A CENTURY THERE NEVER WAS A TIME WHEN HE WOULD NOT HAVE GLADLY GOT UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
6563-63821-0026 AND WALKED TEN MILES IN THE FACE OF A NORTHEASTERLY STORM TO GET A RARE PAMPHLET OF FOUR PAGES HE WAS A MISER OF SUCH THINGS BUT NO THAT WORD DOES NOT DESCRIBE HIM FOR ONE OF THE GREATEST PLEASURES OF HIS LIFE
6563-63821-0027 WAS TO COMMUNICATE HIS TREASURES TO OTHERS AND HE COMMUNICATED TO THE WHOLE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE BEST OF HIS COLLECTIONS IN MASSIVE VOLUMES OF AMERICAN ARCHIVES HE WAS A MISER ONLY IN THE STRENGTH OF HIS DESIRE MORE THAN ONCE HE SAID TO MISTER GEORGE W GREENE
6563-63821-0028 DID I HESITATE BETWEEN A BARREL OF FLOUR AND A RARE BOOK BUT THE BOOK ALWAYS GOT THE UPPER HAND TO THE SAME FRIEND HE MADE A REMARK WHICH SHOWS THAT HIS DESIRE TO COMMUNICATE WAS QUITE AS STRONG AS HIS DESIRE TO OBTAIN WHENEVER SAID HE
6563-63821-0029 I FOUND A LITTLE MORE MONEY IN MY PURSE THAN I ABSOLUTELY NEEDED I PUBLISHED A VOLUME OF HISTORICAL TRACTS IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR THE OLD MAN RELATE HOW THIS TASTE FOR THE TREASURES OF HISTORY WAS FORMED IN HIS MIND HIS FATHER
6563-63821-0030 WHO SERVED DURING THE REVOLUTION IN A NEW JERSEY REGIMENT RETIRED AFTER THE WAR TO THE CITY OF NEW YORK AND AT HIS HOUSE THE JERSEY VETERANS LIKED TO MEET AND TALK OVER THE INCIDENTS OF THE CAMPAIGNS THEY HAD MADE TOGETHER PETER AS A BOY
6563-63821-0031 LOVED TO HEAR THEM TELL THEIR STORIES AND AS HE LISTENED THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HIM ONE EVENING WHY SHOULD ALL THIS BE FORGOTTEN BOY AS HE WAS HE BEGAN TO WRITE THEM DOWN UNDER THE TITLE OF THE UNWRITTEN HISTORY OF THE WAR IN NEW JERSEY
6563-63821-0032 HE MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN IT BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE MANUSCRIPT WAS LOST THE TASTE THEN FORMED GREW WITH HIS GROWTH AND STRENGTHENED WITH HIS STRENGTH AT TEN HE LEFT SCHOOL FOREVER AND WENT INTO A PRINTING OFFICE
6563-63821-0033 WHICH HAS PROVED AN EXCELLENT SCHOOL TO MORE THAN ONE VALUABLE AMERICAN MIND HE BECAME AN ACCOMPLISHED PRINTER AND AT TWENTY TWO WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE NEW YORK TYPOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY AN ORGANIZATION WHICH STILL EXISTS
6563-63821-0034 THEN THE WAR OF EIGHTEEN TWELVE BEGAN LIKE HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM HE SERVED IN THE ARMY FIRST AS PRIVATE THEN AS SERGEANT THEN AS SERGEANT MAJOR THEN AS ENSIGN FINALLY AS LIEUTENANT THE WAR ENDED
6563-63821-0035 HE WENT TO WASHINGTON AS FOREMAN OF A PRINTING OFFICE AND AT WASHINGTON AS PRINTER EDITOR PUBLISHER AND COLLECTOR HE LIVED THE REST OF HIS LONG AND HONORABLE LIFE NEVER RICH AS I HAVE BEFORE REMARKED
6563-63821-0036 THOUGH NEVER WITHOUT A SHARE OF REASONABLE PROSPERITY THE MOST IMPORTANT WORK OF HIS LIFE WAS THE PUBLICATION OF THE AMERICAN ARCHIVES IN WHICH HE WAS AIDED BY CONGRESS HE FURNISHING THE DOCUMENTS AND THE LABOR
6563-63821-0037 AND CONGRESS PAYING THE COST OF PUBLICATION THROUGH THE NINE VOLUMES OF THIS WORK A GREAT NUMBER OF THE MOST CURIOUS AND INTERESTING RECORDS AND MEMORIALS OF AMERICAN HISTORY ARE NOT ONLY PRESERVED BUT MADE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL STUDENTS WHO CAN GET NEAR A LIBRARY
6563-63821-0038 HE HAD ALL THE STATE HOUSES OF THE COUNTRY RANSACKED FOR DOCUMENTS AND A ROOM WAS ASSIGNED HIM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE IN WHICH HIS CLERKS COULD CONVENIENTLY COPY THEM ALL WENT WELL WITH THE WORK UNTIL WILLIAM MARCY BECAME SECRETARY OF STATE
6563-63821-0039 WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO EXAMINE AND APPROVE EACH VOLUME BEFORE IT WENT TO THE PRINTER WHEN PETER FORCE PRESENTED THE MANUSCRIPT OF THE TENTH VOLUME TO SECRETARY MARCY HE RECEIVED A REBUFF WHICH THREW A CLOUD OVER SEVERAL YEARS OF HIS LIFE
6563-63821-0040 I DON'T BELIEVE IN YOUR WORK SIR SAID THE SECRETARY IT IS OF NO USE TO ANYBODY I NEVER READ A PAGE OF IT AND NEVER EXPECT TO BUT SAID MISTER FORCE THE WORK IS PUBLISHED IN VIRTUE OF A CONTRACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT
6563-63821-0041 HERE IS THE MANUSCRIPT OF THE TENTH VOLUME IF THERE IS ANYTHING THERE WHICH YOU THINK OUGHT NOT TO BE THERE HAVE THE GOODNESS TO POINT IT OUT TO ME YOU MAY LEAVE THE PAPERS SIR SAID THE SECRETARY HE LEFT THE PAPERS
6563-63821-0042 BUT NEITHER MARCY NOR HIS SUCCESSORS EVER FOUND TIME TO EXAMINE THAT TENTH VOLUME THOUGH ON THE FIRST DAY OF EVERY OFFICIAL YEAR THE COMPILER CALLED THEIR ATTENTION TO IT FOR SEVEN YEARS HE WAS A SUITOR ON BEHALF OF HIS BELOVED TENTH VOLUME
6563-63821-0043 AND THEN THE WAR OCCURRED AND ALL SUCH MATTERS WERE NECESSARILY PUT ASIDE HE WAS NOW SEVENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE AND HIS GREAT DESIRE WAS TO DISPOSE OF HIS LIBRARY IN SUCH A WAY THAT ITS TREASURES WOULD NOT BE SCATTERED ABROAD
6563-63821-0044 AND PERHAPS LOST FOREVER TO THE COUNTRY AT LENGTH CONGRESS HAVING SANCTIONED THE ENLARGEMENT OF THEIR OWN LIBRARY THEIR LIBRARIAN MISTER SPOFFORD INDUCED THEM TO PURCHASE THE WHOLE MASS JUST AS IT STOOD
6563-63821-0045 FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THE COLLECTION NOW FORMS PART OF THE CONGRESSIONAL LIBRARY COLONEL FORCE LIVED TO THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT WHEN HE DIED AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSALLY BELOVED AND LAMENTED
6563-63821-0046 IN THE SEVENTY EIGHTH YEAR OF HIS AGE ENJOYING ALMOST TO THE LAST TWO OF THE THINGS HE LOVED BEST HIS BOOKS
669-129061-0000 AS RAWDON IN HIS EVENING COSTUME WHICH HE HAD NOW WORN TWO DAYS PASSED BY THE SCARED FEMALE WHO WAS SCOURING THE STEPS AND ENTERED INTO HIS BROTHER'S STUDY LADY JANE
669-129061-0001 IN HER MORNING GOWN WAS UP AND ABOVE STAIRS IN THE NURSERY SUPERINTENDING THE TOILETTES OF HER CHILDREN AND LISTENING TO THE MORNING PRAYERS WHICH THE LITTLE CREATURES PERFORMED AT HER KNEE
669-129061-0002 EVERY MORNING SHE AND THEY PERFORMED THIS DUTY PRIVATELY AND BEFORE THE PUBLIC CEREMONIAL AT WHICH SIR PITT PRESIDED AND AT WHICH ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE HOUSEHOLD WERE EXPECTED TO ASSEMBLE
669-129061-0003 RAWDON SAT DOWN IN THE STUDY BEFORE THE BARONET'S TABLE
669-129061-0004 AND THE LETTERS THE NEATLY DOCKETED BILLS AND SYMMETRICAL PAMPHLETS THE LOCKED ACCOUNT BOOKS DESKS AND DISPATCH BOXES THE BIBLE THE QUARTERLY REVIEW AND THE COURT GUIDE
669-129061-0005 ON THE STUDY TABLE AND AWAITING HIS JUDICIOUS SELECTION AND BY THE SERMON BOOK WAS THE OBSERVER NEWSPAPER DAMP AND NEATLY FOLDED AND FOR SIR PITT'S OWN PRIVATE USE
669-129061-0006 HE HAD READ IN THE JOURNAL A FLAMING ACCOUNT OF FESTIVITIES AT GAUNT HOUSE
669-129061-0007 INVITED BY THE MARQUIS OF STEYNE TO MEET HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS
669-129061-0008 AND HER NIECE AS THEY WERE TAKING EARLY TEA AND HOT BUTTERED TOAST IN THE FORMER LADY'S APARTMENT AND WONDERED HOW THE RAWDING CRAWLEYS COULD GIT ON THE VALET HAD DAMPED AND FOLDED THE PAPER ONCE MORE
669-129061-0009 SO THAT IT LOOKED QUITE FRESH AND INNOCENT AGAINST THE ARRIVAL OF THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE POOR RAWDON TOOK UP THE PAPER AND BEGAN TO TRY AND READ IT UNTIL HIS BROTHER SHOULD ARRIVE
669-129061-0010 OTHERWISE HE WOULD BY NO MEANS PERMIT THE INTRODUCTION OF SUNDAY PAPERS INTO HIS HOUSEHOLD THE THEATRICAL CRITICISMS THE FIGHT FOR A HUNDRED POUNDS A SIDE BETWEEN THE BARKING BUTCHER
669-129061-0011 PUNCTUALLY AS THE SHRILL TONED BELL OF THE BLACK MARBLE STUDY CLOCK BEGAN TO CHIME NINE SIR PITT MADE HIS APPEARANCE FRESH NEAT SMUGLY SHAVED
669-129061-0012 HIS SCANTY HAIR COMBED AND OILED TRIMMING HIS NAILS AS HE DESCENDED THE STAIRS MAJESTICALLY IN A STARCHED CRAVAT AND A GREY FLANNEL DRESSING GOWN A REAL OLD ENGLISH GENTLEMAN IN A WORD
669-129061-0013 A MODEL OF NEATNESS AND EVERY PROPRIETY HE STARTED WHEN HE SAW POOR RAWDON IN HIS STUDY IN TUMBLED CLOTHES WITH BLOOD SHOT EYES AND HIS HAIR OVER HIS FACE
669-129061-0014 HE THOUGHT HIS BROTHER WAS NOT SOBER
669-129061-0015 DON'T BE FRIGHTENED PITT I'M NOT DRUNK SHUT THE DOOR I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU PITT CLOSED THE DOOR AND CAME UP TO THE TABLE WHERE HE SAT DOWN IN THE OTHER ARM CHAIR
669-129061-0016 THAT ONE PLACED FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE STEWARD AGENT OR CONFIDENTIAL VISITOR WHO CAME TO TRANSACT BUSINESS WITH THE BARONET AND TRIMMED HIS NAILS MORE VEHEMENTLY THAN EVER PITT
669-129061-0017 EVEN THE HUNDRED POUNDS THAT JANE TOOK YOU LAST NIGHT WERE PROMISED TO MY LAWYER TO MORROW MORNING AND THE WANT OF IT WILL PUT ME TO GREAT INCONVENIENCE
669-129061-0018 I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT I WON'T ASSIST YOU ULTIMATELY BUT AS FOR PAYING YOUR CREDITORS IN FULL I MIGHT AS WELL HOPE TO PAY THE NATIONAL DEBT
669-129061-0019 WENT THROUGH THE COURT LAST WEEK AND WAS WHAT THEY CALL WHITEWASHED I BELIEVE LORD RAGLAND WOULD NOT PAY A SHILLING FOR HIM AND IT'S NOT MONEY I WANT RAWDON BROKE IN I'M NOT COME TO YOU ABOUT MYSELF
669-129061-0020 NEVER MIND WHAT HAPPENS TO ME WHAT IS THE MATTER THEN SAID PITT SOMEWHAT RELIEVED IT'S THE BOY SAID RAWDON IN A HUSKY VOICE
669-129061-0021 I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME THAT YOU WILL TAKE CHARGE OF HIM WHEN I'M GONE THAT DEAR GOOD WIFE OF YOURS HAS ALWAYS BEEN GOOD TO HIM AND HE'S FONDER OF HER THAN HE IS OF HIS DAMN IT LOOK HERE PITT
669-129061-0022 BUT FOR THIS I MIGHT HAVE BEEN QUITE A DIFFERENT MAN I DIDN'T DO MY DUTY WITH THE REGIMENT SO BAD YOU KNOW HOW I WAS THROWN OVER ABOUT THE MONEY AND WHO GOT IT
669-129061-0023 I WISH I WAS RAWDON REPLIED IF IT WASN'T FOR LITTLE RAWDON I'D HAVE CUT MY THROAT THIS MORNING AND THAT DAMNED VILLAIN'S TOO
669-129061-0024 SIR PITT INSTANTLY GUESSED THE TRUTH AND SURMISED THAT LORD STEYNE WAS THE PERSON WHOSE LIFE RAWDON WISHED TO TAKE THE COLONEL TOLD HIS SENIOR BRIEFLY AND IN BROKEN ACCENTS
669-129061-0025 THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE IT WAS A REGULAR PLAN BETWEEN THAT SCOUNDREL AND HER HE SAID THE BAILIFFS WERE PUT UPON ME I WAS TAKEN AS I WAS GOING OUT OF HIS HOUSE WHEN I WROTE TO HER FOR MONEY
669-129061-0026 SHE SAID SHE WAS ILL IN BED AND PUT ME OFF TO ANOTHER DAY AND WHEN I GOT HOME I FOUND HER IN DIAMONDS AND SITTING WITH THAT VILLAIN ALONE
669-129061-0027 HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE HURRIEDLY THE PERSONAL CONFLICT WITH LORD STEYNE TO AN AFFAIR OF THAT NATURE OF COURSE HE SAID THERE WAS BUT ONE ISSUE
669-129061-0028 AND AFTER HIS CONFERENCE WITH HIS BROTHER HE WAS GOING AWAY TO MAKE THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MEETING WHICH MUST ENSUE
669-129061-0029 RAWDON SAID WITH A BROKEN VOICE AND AS THE BOY HAS NO MOTHER I MUST LEAVE HIM TO YOU AND JANE PITT ONLY IT WILL BE A COMFORT TO ME IF YOU WILL PROMISE ME TO BE HIS FRIEND
669-129061-0030 THE ELDER BROTHER WAS MUCH AFFECTED AND SHOOK RAWDON'S HAND WITH A CORDIALITY SELDOM EXHIBITED BY HIM RAWDON PASSED HIS HAND OVER HIS SHAGGY EYEBROWS
669-129061-0031 THANK YOU BROTHER SAID HE I KNOW I CAN TRUST YOUR WORD I WILL UPON MY HONOUR THE BARONET SAID AND THUS AND ALMOST MUTELY
669-129061-0032 AND I'VE ALWAYS FELT ASHAMED OF HAVING TAKEN THE POOR OLD WOMAN'S MONEY AND HERE'S SOME MORE I'VE ONLY KEPT BACK A FEW POUNDS WHICH BECKY MAY AS WELL HAVE
669-129061-0033 TO GET ON WITH AS HE SPOKE
669-129061-0034 BUT HIS HANDS SHOOK AND HE WAS SO AGITATED THAT THE POCKET BOOK FELL FROM HIM AND OUT OF IT THE THOUSAND POUND NOTE WHICH HAD BEEN THE LAST OF THE UNLUCKY BECKY'S WINNINGS
669-129061-0035 PITT STOOPED AND PICKED THEM UP AMAZED AT SO MUCH WEALTH NOT THAT RAWDON SAID I HOPE TO PUT A BULLET INTO THE MAN WHOM THAT BELONGS TO
669-129061-0036 TO WRAP A BALL IN THE NOTE AND KILL STEYNE WITH IT AFTER THIS COLLOQUY THE BROTHERS ONCE MORE SHOOK HANDS AND PARTED

669-129061-0038 AS THE TWO BROTHERS PASSED OUT OF THE STUDY SHE HELD OUT HER HAND TO RAWDON AND SAID SHE WAS GLAD HE WAS COME TO BREAKFAST THOUGH SHE COULD PERCEIVE BY HIS HAGGARD UNSHORN FACE
669-129061-0039 AND THE DARK LOOKS OF HER HUSBAND THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE QUESTION OF BREAKFAST BETWEEN THEM RAWDON MUTTERED SOME EXCUSES ABOUT AN ENGAGEMENT SQUEEZING HARD THE TIMID LITTLE HAND
669-129061-0040 ANY EXPLANATION THE CHILDREN CAME UP TO SALUTE HIM AND HE KISSED THEM IN HIS USUAL FRIGID MANNER THE MOTHER TOOK BOTH OF THEM CLOSE TO HERSELF AND HELD A HAND OF EACH OF THEM
669-129061-0041 AS THEY KNELT DOWN TO PRAYERS WHICH SIR PITT READ TO THEM AND TO THE SERVANTS IN THEIR SUNDAY SUITS OR LIVERIES RANGED UPON CHAIRS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HISSING TEA URN
669-129061-0042 BREAKFAST WAS SO LATE THAT DAY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE DELAYS WHICH HAD OCCURRED THAT THE CHURCH BELLS BEGAN TO RING WHILST THEY WERE SITTING OVER THEIR MEAL AND LADY JANE WAS TOO ILL SHE SAID

669-129061-0045 AND SAY THAT COLONEL CRAWLEY WOULD BE ALL DAY AFTER ONE O'CLOCK AT THE REGENT CLUB IN SAINT JAMES'S STREET NOT AT HOME THE FAT RED FACED MAN LOOKED AFTER HIM WITH ASTONISHMENT
669-129061-0046 AS HE STRODE AWAY SO DID THE PEOPLE IN THEIR SUNDAY CLOTHES WHO WERE OUT SO EARLY THE CHARITY BOYS WITH SHINING FACES THE GREENGROCER LOLLING AT HIS DOOR
669-129061-0047 AND THE PUBLICAN SHUTTING HIS SHUTTERS IN THE SUNSHINE AGAINST SERVICE COMMENCED THE PEOPLE JOKED AT THE CAB STAND ABOUT HIS APPEARANCE AS HE TOOK A CARRIAGE THERE

669-129061-0050 WERE THRONGED WITH PEOPLE OUT UPON THEIR SUNDAY PLEASURE BUT THE COLONEL WAS MUCH TOO BUSY TO TAKE ANY HEED OF THESE PHENOMENA AND ARRIVING AT KNIGHTSBRIDGE
669-129061-0051 SPEEDILY MADE HIS WAY UP TO THE ROOM OF HIS OLD FRIEND AND COMRADE CAPTAIN MACMURDO WHO CRAWLEY FOUND TO HIS SATISFACTION WAS IN BARRACKS CAPTAIN MACMURDO
669-129061-0052 A VETERAN OFFICER AND WATERLOO MAN GREATLY LIKED BY HIS REGIMENT IN WHICH WANT OF MONEY ALONE PREVENTED HIM FROM ATTAINING THE HIGHEST RANKS WAS ENJOYING THE FORENOON CALMLY IN BED

669-129061-0056 AND THE BARKING BUTCHER WHICH HAS BEEN BEFORE MENTIONED A VENERABLE BRISTLY WARRIOR WITH A LITTLE CLOSE SHAVED GREY HEAD WITH A SILK NIGHTCAP A RED FACE AND NOSE AND A GREAT
669-129061-0057 DYED MOUSTACHE WHEN RAWDON TOLD THE CAPTAIN HE WANTED A FRIEND THE LATTER KNEW PERFECTLY WELL ON WHAT DUTY OF FRIENDSHIP HE WAS CALLED TO ACT AND INDEED HAD CONDUCTED SCORES OF AFFAIRS
669-129061-0058 FOR HIS ACQUAINTANCES WITH THE GREATEST PRUDENCE AND SKILL HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE LATE LAMENTED COMMANDER IN CHIEF HAD HAD THE GREATEST REGARD FOR MACMURDO ON THIS ACCOUNT
669-129061-0059 CAPTAIN MARKER IT'S ABOUT ABOUT MY WIFE CRAWLEY ANSWERED CASTING DOWN HIS EYES AND TURNING VERY RED THE OTHER GAVE A WHISTLE
669-129061-0060 I ALWAYS SAID SHE'D THROW YOU OVER HE BEGAN INDEED THERE WERE BETS IN THE REGIMENT AND AT THE CLUBS REGARDING THE PROBABLE FATE OF COLONEL CRAWLEY
669-129061-0061 THINK OF HIS ONLY FINDING HER OUT NOW THE CAPTAIN THOUGHT TO HIMSELF AND REMEMBERED A HUNDRED PARTICULAR CONVERSATIONS AT THE MESS TABLE IN WHICH MISSUS CRAWLEY'S REPUTATION
669-129061-0062 HAD BEEN TORN TO SHREDS THERE'S NO WAY BUT ONE OUT OF IT
669-129061-0063 AND THERE'S ONLY A WAY OUT OF IT FOR ONE OF US MAC DO YOU UNDERSTAND I WAS PUT OUT OF THE WAY ARRESTED I FOUND EM ALONE TOGETHER

669-129061-0066 IT WAS DAMNED UNFRIENDLY MAC SAID RAWDON QUITE OVERCOME AND COVERING HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS HE GAVE WAY TO AN EMOTION THE SIGHT OF WHICH CAUSED THE TOUGH OLD CAMPAIGNER
669-129061-0067 I GAVE UP EVERYTHING I HAD TO HER I'M A BEGGAR BECAUSE I WOULD MARRY HER BY JOVE SIR I'VE PAWNED MY OWN WATCH IN ORDER TO GET HER ANYTHING SHE FANCIED AND SHE

669-129061-0069 UNDER WHICH HIS COUNSELLOR HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN HIM LABOUR TOLD MACMURDO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE STORY HIS ADVISER CAUGHT AT SOME STRAY HINTS IN IT
669-129061-0070 SHE MAY BE INNOCENT AFTER ALL HE SAID SHE SAYS SO
669-129061-0071 THIS IS WHAT HE GAVE HER MAC AND SHE KEP IT UNKNOWN TO ME AND WITH THIS MONEY IN THE HOUSE SHE REFUSED TO STAND BY ME WHEN I WAS LOCKED UP
669-129061-0072 RAWDON DISPATCHED CAPTAIN MACMURDO'S SERVANT TO CURZON STREET WITH AN ORDER TO THE DOMESTIC THERE TO GIVE UP A BAG OF CLOTHES OF WHICH THE COLONEL HAD GREAT NEED AND DURING THE MAN'S ABSENCE
669-129061-0073 CAPTAIN MACMURDO HAD THE HONOUR OF WAITING UPON THE MARQUIS OF STEYNE ON THE PART OF COLONEL RAWDON CRAWLEY AND BEGGED TO INTIMATE THAT HE WAS EMPOWERED BY THE COLONEL
669-129061-0074 TO MAKE ANY ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MEETING WHICH HE HAD NO DOUBT IT WAS HIS LORDSHIP'S INTENTION TO DEMAND AND WHICH THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE MORNING HAD RENDERED INEVITABLE
669-129061-0075 IN THE MOST POLITE MANNER TO APPOINT A FRIEND WITH WHOM HE CAPTAIN M M MIGHT COMMUNICATE AND DESIRED THAT THE MEETING MIGHT TAKE PLACE WITH AS LITTLE DELAY AS POSSIBLE
669-129061-0076 IN CURZON STREET BUT WITHOUT THE CARPET BAG AND PORTMANTEAU FOR WHICH HE HAD BEEN SENT AND WITH A VERY PUZZLED AND ODD FACE THEY WON'T GIVE EM UP
669-129061-0077 SAID THE MAN THERE'S A REGULAR SHINTY IN THE HOUSE AND EVERYTHING AT SIXES AND SEVENS THE LANDLORD'S COME IN AND TOOK POSSESSION THE SERVANTS WAS A DRINKIN UP IN THE DRAWINGROOM THEY SAID
669-129061-0078 THE MAN ADDED AFTER A PAUSE ONE OF THE SERVANTS IS OFF ALREADY
669-129061-0079 THE MAN AS WAS VERY NOISY AND DRUNK INDEED SAYS NOTHING SHALL GO OUT OF THE HOUSE UNTIL HIS WAGES IS PAID UP THE ACCOUNT OF THIS LITTLE REVOLUTION IN MAY FAIR ASTONISHED
669-129061-0080 BUT ABOUT GOING HOME NEXT SATURDAY WHEN HIS FATHER WOULD CERTAINLY TIP HIM AND PERHAPS WOULD TAKE HIM TO THE PLAY HE'S A REGULAR TRUMP THAT BOY THE FATHER WENT ON STILL MUSING ABOUT HIS SON
669-129061-0081 I SAY MAC IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG IF I DROP I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO TO GO AND SEE HIM YOU KNOW AND SAY THAT I WAS VERY FOND OF HIM AND THAT
669-129061-0082 MISTER MACMURDO HAD ALSO OCCASION TO TAKE OFF HIS SILK NIGHT CAP AND RUB IT ACROSS HIS EYES GO DOWN AND ORDER SOME BREAKFAST HE SAID TO HIS MAN IN A LOUD CHEERFUL VOICE WHAT'LL YOU HAVE CRAWLEY
669-129061-0083 LET'S SAY AND CLAY LAY OUT SOME DRESSING THINGS FOR THE COLONEL WE WERE ALWAYS PRETTY MUCH OF A SIZE RAWDON MY BOY AND NEITHER OF US RIDE SO LIGHT AS WE DID WHEN WE FIRST ENTERED THE CORPS
669-129061-0084 WITH WHICH AND LEAVING THE COLONEL TO DRESS HIMSELF MACMURDO TURNED ROUND TOWARDS THE WALL AND RESUMED THE PERUSAL OF BELL'S LIFE UNTIL SUCH TIME AS HIS FRIEND'S TOILETTE WAS COMPLETE
669-129061-0085 HE WAXED HIS MUSTACHIOS INTO A STATE OF BRILLIANT POLISH AND PUT ON A TIGHT CRAVAT AND A TRIM BUFF WAISTCOAT SO THAT ALL THE YOUNG OFFICERS IN THE MESS ROOM WHITHER CRAWLEY HAD PRECEDED HIS FRIEND
669-129074-0000 WHICH CONTAINS BIRTHS MARRIAGES AND DEATHS WHATEVER BECKY'S PRIVATE PLAN MIGHT BE BY WHICH DOBBIN'S TRUE LOVE WAS TO BE CROWNED WITH SUCCESS
669-129074-0001 THE LITTLE WOMAN THOUGHT THAT THE SECRET MIGHT KEEP AND INDEED BEING BY NO MEANS SO MUCH INTERESTED
669-129074-0002 SHE HAD A GREAT NUMBER OF THINGS PERTAINING TO HERSELF TO CONSIDER AND WHICH CONCERNED HER A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN MAJOR DOBBIN'S HAPPINESS IN THIS LIFE
669-129074-0003 SHE FOUND HERSELF SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY IN SNUG COMFORTABLE QUARTERS SURROUNDED BY FRIENDS KINDNESS AND GOOD NATURED SIMPLE PEOPLE
669-129074-0004 AND SAY HIS PRAYERS IN THE MOSQUES
669-129074-0005 SHE PICKETED HER STEED HUNG UP HER WEAPONS AND WARMED HERSELF COMFORTABLY BY HIS FIRE THE HALT IN THAT ROVING RESTLESS LIFE WAS INEXPRESSIBLY SOOTHING AND PLEASANT TO HER
669-129074-0006 OF AMELIA HE DROVE OUT WITH BECKY IN HIS OPEN CARRIAGE HE ASKED LITTLE PARTIES AND INVENTED FESTIVITIES TO DO HER HONOUR TAPEWORM
669-129074-0007 CAME TO DINE WITH JOS AND THEN CAME EVERY DAY TO PAY HIS RESPECTS TO BECKY POOR EMMY WHO WAS NEVER VERY TALKATIVE AND MORE GLUM AND SILENT THAN EVER AFTER DOBBIN'S DEPARTURE WAS QUITE FORGOTTEN
669-129074-0008 THERE HEARD OF HER FASCINATIONS AND WERE QUITE CURIOUS TO KNOW HER WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT SHE WAS NOBLE OF AN ANCIENT ENGLISH FAMILY THAT HER HUSBAND WAS A COLONEL OF THE GUARD
669-129074-0009 AND THE LADIES WERE EVEN MORE READY TO CALL HER DU
669-129074-0010 THAN THEY HAD BEEN TO BESTOW THE SAME INESTIMABLE BENEFITS UPON AMELIA LOVE AND LIBERTY ARE INTERPRETED BY THOSE SIMPLE GERMANS IN A WAY WHICH HONEST FOLKS
669-129074-0011 SHE BROUGHT EVERYBODY TO THE HOUSE AND SHE MADE JOS BELIEVE THAT IT WAS HIS OWN GREAT SOCIAL TALENTS AND WIT
669-129074-0012 AS FOR EMMY WHO FOUND HERSELF NOT IN THE LEAST MISTRESS OF HER OWN HOUSE EXCEPT WHEN THE BILLS WERE TO BE PAID BECKY SOON DISCOVERED THE WAY TO SOOTHE AND PLEASE HER
669-129074-0013 SHE TALKED TO HER PERPETUALLY ABOUT MAJOR DOBBIN SENT ABOUT HIS BUSINESS AND MADE NO SCRUPLE OF DECLARING HER ADMIRATION FOR THAT EXCELLENT HIGH MINDED GENTLEMAN
669-129074-0014 AND TO SUCH AN ANGEL AS HIM WHOM SHE HAD HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO MARRY WAS MARRIED FOREVER BUT SHE HAD NO OBJECTION TO HEAR THE MAJOR PRAISED
669-129074-0015 AND INDEED BROUGHT THE CONVERSATION ROUND TO THE DOBBIN SUBJECT A SCORE OF TIMES EVERY DAY MEANS WERE EASILY FOUND TO WIN THE FAVOUR OF GEORGY AND THE SERVANTS AMELIA'S MAID
669-129074-0016 IT HAS BEEN SAID WAS HEART AND SOUL IN FAVOUR OF THE GENEROUS MAJOR HAVING AT FIRST DISLIKED BECKY FOR BEING THE MEANS OF DISMISSING HIM FROM THE PRESENCE OF HER MISTRESS
669-129074-0017 SHE WAS RECONCILED TO MISSUS CRAWLEY SUBSEQUENTLY BECAUSE THE LATTER BECAME WILLIAM'S MOST ARDENT ADMIRER AND CHAMPION AND IN THOSE NIGHTLY CONCLAVES IN WHICH THE TWO LADIES INDULGED AFTER THEIR PARTIES
669-129074-0018 AND WHILE MISS PAYNE WAS BRUSHING THEIR AIRS
669-129074-0019 AND AS SHE LOOKED AT HER HUSBAND'S PORTRAIT OF NIGHTS IT NO LONGER REPROACHED HER PERHAPS SHE REPROACHED IT NOW WILLIAM WAS GONE EMMY WAS NOT VERY HAPPY AFTER HER HEROIC SACRIFICE
669-129074-0020 SHE WAS VERY DISTRAITE NERVOUS SILENT AND ILL TO PLEASE THE FAMILY HAD NEVER KNOWN HER SO PEEVISH SHE GREW PALE AND ILL
669-129074-0021 WAS ONE OF THEM THAT TENDER LOVE SONG OF WEBER'S WHICH IN OLD FASHIONED DAYS YOUNG LADIES AND WHEN YOU WERE SCARCELY BORN SHOWED THAT THOSE WHO LIVED BEFORE YOU KNEW
669-129074-0022 TOO HOW TO LOVE AND TO SING CERTAIN SONGS I SAY TO WHICH THE MAJOR WAS PARTIAL
669-129074-0023 SHE WOULD BREAK OFF IN THE MIDST OF THE SONG
669-129074-0024 RUMMAGING HIS MOTHER'S DESK SOME TIME AFTERWARDS FOUND THE GLOVES NEATLY FOLDED UP
669-129074-0025 DURING WHICH REBECCA WAS LEFT TO THE SOCIETY OF MISTER JOSEPH
669-129074-0026 IN A WAY WHICH EVEN MADE THE BOY SMILE SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE THOUGHT MAJOR WILLIAM WAS THE BEST MAN IN ALL THE WORLD THE GENTLEST AND THE KINDEST THE BRAVEST AND THE HUMBLEST
669-129074-0027 OVER AND OVER AGAIN SHE TOLD HIM HOW THEY OWED EVERYTHING WHICH THEY POSSESSED IN THE WORLD TO THAT KIND FRIEND'S BENEVOLENT CARE OF THEM HOW HE HAD BEFRIENDED THEM ALL THROUGH THEIR POVERTY AND MISFORTUNES
669-129074-0028 WATCHED OVER THEM WHEN NOBODY CARED FOR THEM HOW ALL HIS COMRADES ADMIRED HIM THOUGH HE NEVER SPOKE OF HIS OWN GALLANT ACTIONS HOW GEORGY'S FATHER TRUSTED HIM BEYOND ALL OTHER MEN
669-129074-0029 AND HAD BEEN CONSTANTLY BEFRIENDED BY THE GOOD WILLIAM WHY WHEN YOUR PAPA WAS A LITTLE BOY SHE SAID HE OFTEN TOLD ME THAT IT WAS WILLIAM WHO DEFENDED HIM AGAINST A TYRANT AT THE SCHOOL WHERE THEY WERE
669-129074-0030 AND THEIR FRIENDSHIP NEVER CEASED FROM THAT DAY UNTIL THE LAST WHEN YOUR DEAR FATHER FELL DID DOBBIN KILL THE MAN WHO KILLED PAPA
669-129074-0031 WHEN I'M IN THE ARMY WON'T I HATE THE FRENCH THAT'S ALL
6818-68772-0000 CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE BOOMERANG THE LAWN FETE WAS A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS AND EVERY FARMER'S WIFE WAS PROUD OF HER SATIN BADGE BEARING THE MONOGRAM W P L AND THE WORDS
6818-68772-0001 FORBES FOR REPRESENTATIVE CERTAIN EDIBLES SUCH AS CHARLOTTE RUSSE SPANISH CREAM WINE JELLIES AND MOUSSES TO SAY NOTHING OF THE CAVIARS AND ANCHOVIES WERE WHOLLY UNKNOWN TO THEM
6818-68772-0002 BUT THEY ATE THE DAINTIES WITH A WISE DISREGARD OF THEIR INEXPERIENCE AND ENJOYED THEM IMMENSELY THE OLD BUTLER WAS A GENERAL IN HIS WAY AND IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE STAFF OF SERVANTS AT ELMHURST
6818-68772-0003 WAS INSUFFICIENT TO COPE WITH SUCH A THRONG HE ALLOWED LOUISE TO IMPRESS SEVERAL FARMERS DAUGHTERS INTO SERVICE AND WAS ABLE TO FEED EVERYONE WITHOUT DELAY AND IN AN ABUNDANT AND SATISFACTORY MANNER
6818-68772-0004 AFTER LUNCHEON BEGAN THE SPEECH MAKING INTERSPERSED WITH MUSIC BY THE BAND LOUISE MADE THE PRELIMINARY ADDRESS AND ALTHOUGH HER VOICE WAS NOT VERY STRONG
6818-68772-0005 THE SILENT ATTENTION OF HER HEARERS PERMITTED HER TO BE GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD SHE CALLED ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THIS CAMPAIGN WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT PROMISED MORE BEAUTIFUL AND ATTRACTIVE HOUSES FOR THE FARMERS AND TOWNSMEN ALIKE
6818-68772-0006 WE HAD ALL GROWN SO ACCUSTOMED TO ADVERTISING SIGNS SHE SAID THAT WE FAILED TO NOTICE HOW THICK THEY WERE BECOMING OR HOW BOLD AND OVERPOWERING FROM A FEW SCATTERED ANNOUNCEMENTS ON FENCE BOARDS
6818-68772-0007 THEY HAD CROWDED THEMSELVES INTO MORE PROMINENT PLACES UNTIL THE BARNS AND SHEDS AND THE VERY ROCKS WERE DAUBED WITH GLARING LETTERS ASKING US TO BUY THE MEDICINES SOAPS TOBACCOS AND OTHER WARES THE MANUFACTURERS WERE ANXIOUS TO SELL
6818-68772-0008 EVERY COUNTRY ROAD BECAME AN ADVERTISING AVENUE SCARCELY A COUNTRY HOUSE WAS FREE FROM SIGNS OF SOME SORT YET THE PEOPLE TAMELY SUBMITTED TO THIS IMPOSITION BECAUSE THEY KNEW NO WAY TO AVOID IT
6818-68772-0009 WHEN MISTER FORBES BEGAN HIS CAMPAIGN TO RESTORE THE HOMESTEADS TO THEIR FORMER BEAUTY AND DIGNITY A CRY WAS RAISED AGAINST HIM BUT THIS WAS BECAUSE THE FARMERS DID NOT UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH THIS REFORM MEANT TO THEM
6818-68772-0010 SO WE GAVE THEM AN OBJECT LESSON WE PAINTED OUT ALL THE SIGNS IN THIS SECTION AT OUR OWN EXPENSE THAT YOU MIGHT SEE HOW MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL YOUR HOMES ARE WITHOUT THEM
6818-68772-0011 WE BELIEVE THAT NONE OF YOU WILL EVER CARE TO ALLOW ADVERTISING SIGNS ON YOUR PROPERTY AGAIN AND THAT THE QUIET REFINEMENT OF THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY WILL INDUCE MANY OTHER PLACES TO FOLLOW OUR EXAMPLE
6818-68772-0012 UNTIL ADVERTISERS ARE FORCED TO CONFINE THEMSELVES TO NEWSPAPERS MAGAZINES AND CIRCULARS THEIR ONLY LEGITIMATE CHANNELS THIS MUCH MISTER FORBES HAS ALREADY DONE FOR YOU AND HE WILL NOW TELL YOU WHAT ELSE IF HE IS ELECTED
6818-68772-0013 HE PROPOSES TO DO KENNETH THEN TOOK THE PLATFORM AND WAS WELCOMED WITH A HEARTY CHEER HE MODESTLY ASSURED THEM THAT A REPRESENTATIVE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE COULD ACCOMPLISH MUCH GOOD FOR HIS DISTRICT
6818-68772-0014 IF HE HONESTLY DESIRED TO DO SO THAT WAS WHAT A REPRESENTATIVE WAS FOR TO REPRESENT HIS PEOPLE IT WAS FOLLY TO ELECT ANY MAN WHO WOULD FORGET THAT DUTY AND PROMOTE ONLY HIS OWN INTERESTS THROUGH THE POSITION OF POWER TO WHICH THE PEOPLE HAD APPOINTED HIM
6818-68772-0015 MISTER FORBES ADMITTED THAT HE HAD UNDERTAKEN THIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE HE WAS OPPOSED TO OFFENSIVE ADVERTISING SIGNS BUT NOW HE HAD BECOME INTERESTED IN OTHER ISSUES AND WAS ANXIOUS TO BE ELECTED SO THAT HE COULD CARRY ON THE WORK OF REFORM
6818-68772-0016 THEY NEEDED MORE SCHOOL HOUSES FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND MANY OTHER THINGS WHICH HE HOPED TO PROVIDE AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVE DURING THIS ORATION BETH HAPPENED TO GLANCE UP AT THE HOUSE AND HER SHARP EYES DETECTED THE MAID ELIZA
6818-68772-0017 STANDING SHIELDED BEHIND THE HALF CLOSED BLIND OF AN UPPER WINDOW AND LISTENING TO AS WELL AS WATCHING THE PROCEEDINGS BELOW THEN SHE REMEMBERED HOW THE GIRL HAD BEEN LAUGHING AND TALKING WITH MISTER HOPKINS WHEN SHE FIRST SAW HER
6818-68772-0018 HER FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO DENOUNCE THE MAID AT ONCE AND HAVE HER DISCHARGED BUT THE TIME WAS NOT OPPORTUNE SO SHE WAITED UNTIL THE FESTIVITIES WERE ENDED
6818-68772-0019 IT HAD BEEN A GREAT DAY FOR THE FAMILIES OF THE NEIGHBORING FARMERS AND THEY DROVE HOMEWARD IN THE LATE AFTERNOON FULL OF ENTHUSIASM OVER THE ROYAL MANNER IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN ENTERTAINED AND ADMIRATION FOR THE GIRLS WHO HAD PROVIDED THE FUN AND FEASTING
6818-68772-0020 INDEED THERE WERE MORE KINDLY THOUGHTS EXPRESSED FOR THE INHABITANTS OF ELMHURST THAN HAD EVER BEFORE BEEN HEARD IN A SINGLE DAY IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTY AND THE GREAT AND THE HUMBLE SEEMED MORE CLOSELY DRAWN TOGETHER
6818-68772-0021 WHEN THE LAST GUEST HAD DEPARTED BETH GOT HER COUSINS AND KENNETH TOGETHER AND TOLD THEM OF HER DISCOVERY OF THE SPY KENNETH WAS AT FIRST GREATLY ANNOYED AND PROPOSED TO CALL MARTHA AND HAVE THE FALSE MAID EJECTED FROM THE PREMISES
6818-68772-0022 BUT PATSY'S WISE LITTLE HEAD COUNSELLED CAUTION IN HANDLING THE MATTER NOW THAT WE KNOW HER SECRET SHE SAID THE GIRL CANNOT CAUSE US MORE REAL HARM
6818-68772-0023 AND THERE MAY BE A WAY TO CIRCUMVENT THIS UNSCRUPULOUS HOPKINS AND TURN THE INCIDENT TO OUR OWN ADVANTAGE LET'S THINK IT OVER CAREFULLY BEFORE WE ACT THERE'S ANOTHER THING SAID BETH SUPPORTING HER COUSIN
6818-68772-0024 I'M INTERESTED IN THE MYSTERY SURROUNDING THE GIRL I NOW THINK I WAS WRONG IN SUSPECTING HER TO BE THE LOST LUCY ROGERS BUT THERE IS SURELY SOME ROMANCE CONNECTED WITH HER AND SHE IS NOT WHAT SHE SEEMS TO BE
6818-68772-0025 I'D LIKE TO STUDY HER A LITTLE IT WAS ABSURD TO CONNECT HER WITH LUCY ROGERS OBSERVED KENNETH FOR THERE IS NOTHING IN HER CHARACTER TO REMIND ONE OF THE UNHAPPY GIRL EXCEPT HER LOOKS ADDED BETH SHE'S THE LIVING IMAGE OF MISSUS ROGERS
6818-68772-0026 THAT ISN'T IMPORTANT REPLIED LOUISE IT IS PROBABLY A MERE COINCIDENCE NONE OF US HAVE EVER SEEN THE REAL LUCY AND SHE MAY NOT RESEMBLE HER MOTHER AT ALL MISSUS ROGERS CLAIMS SHE DOES SAID BETH BUT ANYHOW
6818-68772-0027 I HAVE A WISH TO KEEP THIS GIRL AT THE HOUSE WHERE I CAN STUDY HER CHARACTER THEN KEEP HER MY DEAR DECIDED KENNETH I'LL SET A COUPLE OF MEN TO WATCH THE GATES AND IF SHE GOES OUT WE'LL KNOW WHOM SHE MEETS
6818-68772-0028 THE MOST SHE CAN DO IS TO REPORT OUR MOVEMENTS TO MISTER HOPKINS AND THERE'S NO GREAT HARM IN THAT SO THE MATTER WAS LEFT FOR THE TIME AND AS IF TO VERIFY BETH'S SUSPICIONS ELIZA WAS SEEN TO LEAVE THE GROUNDS AFTER DUSK
6818-68772-0029 AND MEET MISTER HOPKINS IN THE LANE THEY CONVERSED TOGETHER A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN THE MAID CALMLY RETURNED AND WENT TO HER ROOM THE NEXT DAY MISTER HOPKINS SCATTERED FLARING HAND BILLS OVER THE DISTRICT
6818-68772-0030 THEY READ HOPKINS THE MAN OF THE TIMES IS THE CHAMPION OF THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES FORBES WHO NEVER EARNED A DOLLAR IN HIS LIFE BUT INHERITED HIS MONEY IS TRYING TO TAKE THE DOLLARS OUT OF THE POCKETS OF THE FARMERS
6818-68772-0031 BY DEPRIVING THEM OF THE INCOME DERIVED BY SELLING SPACES FOR ADVERTISING SIGNS HE IS ROBBING THE FARMERS WHILE CLAIMING HE WANTS TO BEAUTIFY THEIR HOMES
6818-68772-0032 THEREFORE THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR THE HONORABLE ERASTUS HOPKINS FOR REPRESENTATIVE THEN FOLLOWED AN ESTIMATE OF THE MONEY PAID THE FARMERS OF THE DISTRICT BY THE ADVERTISERS DURING THE PAST FIVE YEARS
6818-68772-0033 AMOUNTING TO SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN THE AGGREGATE THE CIRCULAR ENDED IN THIS WAY HOPKINS CHALLENGES FORBES TO DENY THESE FACTS HOPKINS IS WILLING TO MEET FORBES BEFORE THE PUBLIC AT ANY TIME AND PLACE HE MAY SELECT
6818-68772-0034 TO SETTLE THIS ARGUMENT IN JOINT DEBATE THE GIRLS ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE AT ONCE WITHIN TWO DAYS EVERY FARMER HAD RECEIVED A NOTICE THAT MISTER FORBES WOULD MEET MISTER HOPKINS
6818-68772-0035 AT THE FAIRVIEW OPERA HOUSE ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON TO DEBATE THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER ADVERTISING SIGNS BROUGHT GOOD OR EVIL TO THE COMMUNITY THE CAMPAIGN WAS NOW GETTING HOT
6818-68772-0036 BECAUSE OF THE ACTIVITY OF THE OPPOSING CANDIDATES EVERY VOTER IN THE DISTRICT HAD BECOME MORE OR LESS INTERESTED IN THE FIGHT AND PEOPLE WERE TAKING ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WITH UNUSUAL EARNESTNESS
6818-68772-0037 MISTER HOPKINS WAS NOT GREATLY PLEASED THAT HIS CHALLENGE HAD BEEN ACCEPTED HE HAD IMAGINED THAT THE FORBES PARTY WOULD IGNORE IT AND LEAVE HIM THE PRESTIGE OF CROWING OVER HIS OPPONENT'S TIMIDITY
6818-68772-0038 BUT HE REMEMBERED HOW EASILY HE HAD SUBDUED KENNETH AT THE SCHOOL HOUSE MEETING BEFORE THE NOMINATIONS AND HAD NO DOUBT OF HIS ABILITY TO REPEAT THE OPERATION HE WAS MUCH INCENSED AGAINST THE GIRLS WHO WERE WORKING FOR KENNETH FORBES
6818-68772-0039 FOR HE REALIZED THAT THEY WERE PROVING AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE CAMPAIGN HE EVEN ATTRIBUTED TO THEM MORE THAN THEY DESERVED FOR UNCLE JOHN'S TELLING ACTIVITIES WERE SO QUIETLY CONDUCTED
6818-68772-0040 THAT HE WAS PERSONALLY LOST SIGHT OF ENTIRELY BY MISTER HOPKINS MISTER HOPKINS HAD THEREFORE BECOME SO ENRAGED THAT AGAINST THE ADVICE OF HIS FRIENDS HE ISSUED A CIRCULAR SNEERING AT WOMEN IN POLITICS
6818-68772-0041 THE NEWSPAPERS HAVING BEEN SUBSIDIZED BY THE OPPOSITION SO EARLY IN THE GAME MISTER HOPKINS HAD DRIVEN TO EMPLOY THE CIRCULAR METHOD OF COMMUNICATING WITH THE VOTERS SCARCELY A DAY PASSED NOW THAT HIS CORPS OF DISTRIBUTORS
6818-68772-0042 DID NOT LEAVE SOME OF HIS LITERATURE AT EVERY DWELLING IN THE DISTRICT HIS TIRADE AGAINST THE GIRLS WAS NEITHER CONVINCING NOR IN GOOD TASTE HE ASKED THE VOTERS IF THEY WERE WILLING TO SUBMIT TO PETTICOAT GOVERNMENT AND PERMIT A
6818-68772-0043 LOT OF BOARDING SCHOOL GIRLS WITH MORE BOLDNESS THAN MODESTY TO DICTATE THE POLICIES OF THE COMMUNITY THESE FRIZZLE HEADED FEMALES CONTINUED THE CIRCULAR ARE TRYING TO MAKE YOUR WIVES AND DAUGHTERS AS REBELLIOUS AND UNREASONABLE AS THEY ARE THEMSELVES
6818-68772-0044 BUT NO MAN OF SENSE WILL PERMIT A WOMAN TO INFLUENCE HIS VOTE IT IS A DISGRACE TO THIS DISTRICT THAT MISTER FORBES ALLOWS HIS GIRLISH CAMPAIGN TO BE RUN BY A LOT OF MISSES WHO SHOULD BE AT HOME DARNING STOCKINGS OR IF THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT
6818-68772-0045 IF I'M NOT MUCH MISTAKEN MISTER HOPKINS HAS THROWN A BOOMERANG EVERY WOMAN WHO ATTENDED THE FETE IS NOW LINKED WITH US AS AN ALLY AND EVERY ONE OF THEM WILL RESENT THIS FOOLISH CIRCULAR
6818-68772-0046 I'M SORRY SAID KENNETH THAT YOU GIRLS SHOULD BE FORCED TO ENDURE THIS I FEARED SOMETHING LIKE IT WHEN YOU INSISTED ON TAKING A HAND IN THE GAME BUT THEY LAUGHED AT HIM
6818-68772-0047 AND AT MISTER HOPKINS AND DECLARED THEY WERE NOT AT ALL OFFENDED ONE CANNOT TOUCH PITCH WITHOUT BEING DEFILED SAID MISTER WATSON GRAVELY
6818-68772-0048 AS MISTER HOPKINS KNOWS IT IS LITTLE MORE THAN PITCH I CANNOT SEE THAT THERE IS ANYTHING MY GIRLS HAVE DONE TO FORFEIT RESPECT AND ADMIRATION ASSERTED UNCLE JOHN STOUTLY TO ACCUSE THEM OF BOLDNESS OR IMMODESTY IS ABSURD
6818-68772-0049 THEY HAVE MERELY GONE TO WORK IN A BUSINESS LIKE MANNER AND USED THEIR WITS AND COMMON SENSE IN EDUCATING THE VOTERS REALLY MY DEARS I'M MORE PROUD OF YOU TODAY THAN I'VE EVER BEEN BEFORE HE CONCLUDED
6818-76332-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE STRANGER AT THE DOOR MISSUS COLLINGWOOD REMAINED A LONG TIME UP STAIRS
6818-76332-0001 SO LONG INDEED THAT THE GIRLS BEGAN TO BE RATHER UNEASY FEARING THAT SHE HAD FAINTED OR PERHAPS WAS ILL OR OVERCOME
6818-76332-0002 DO YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO GO UP ASKED CYNTHIA ANXIOUSLY PERHAPS SHE NEEDS HELP NO I THINK SHE JUST WANTS TO BE BY HERSELF IT WAS FINE OF YOU CYNTHIA TO SEND HER UP ALONE
6818-76332-0003 I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE I'D HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AT LENGTH THEY HEARD HER COMING SLOWLY DOWN AND PRESENTLY SHE REENTERED THE DRAWING ROOM THEY COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS MUCH MOVED AND HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN CRYING
6818-76332-0004 SHE DID NOT SPEAK TO THEM AT ONCE BUT WENT AND STOOD BY THE MANTEL LOOKING UP LONG AND EARNESTLY AT THE PORTRAIT OF THE TWINS MY BABIES THEY HEARD HER MURMUR UNCONSCIOUSLY ALOUD
6818-76332-0005 AT LAST HOWEVER SHE CAME TO THEM AND SAT DOWN ONCE MORE BETWEEN THEM ON THE SOFA THEY WONDERED NERVOUSLY WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO SAY MY LITTLE GIRLS SHE BEGAN FORGIVE ME
6818-76332-0006 I SUPPOSE YOU CONSIDER YOURSELVES ALMOST YOUNG LADIES BUT YOU SEE I AM AN OLD WOMAN I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU A LITTLE ABOUT MY LIFE BUT I SUPPOSE YOU ALREADY KNOW MOST OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS
6818-76332-0007 SHE PATTED JOYCE'S HAND THERE ARE SOME THINGS HOWEVER THAT PERHAPS YOU DO NOT KNOW AND AFTER WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME YOU DESERVE TO I WAS MARRIED WHEN I WAS A VERY YOUNG GIRL
6818-76332-0008 ONLY SEVENTEEN I WAS A SOUTHERNER BUT MY HUSBAND CAME FROM THE NORTH AND BROUGHT ME UP NORTH HERE TO LIVE I ALWAYS HATED IT THIS NORTHERN LIFE AND THOUGH I
6818-76332-0009 LOVED MY HUSBAND DEARLY I HATED HIS DEVOTION TO IT WE NEVER AGREED ABOUT THOSE QUESTIONS WHEN MY TWIN BABIES WERE BORN I SECRETLY DETERMINED THAT THEY SHOULD BE SOUTHERNERS
6818-76332-0010 IN SPIRIT AND ONLY SOUTHERNERS I PLANNED THAT WHEN THEY WERE BOTH OLD ENOUGH THEY SHOULD MARRY IN THE SOUTH AND LIVE THERE AND MY HUSBAND AND I WITH THEM
6818-76332-0011 BUT IN THIS LIFE THINGS SELDOM TURN OUT AS WE PLAN MY LITTLE GIRL DIED BEFORE SHE WAS THREE AND I HAD SCARCELY BECOME RECONCILED TO THIS GRIEF
6818-76332-0012 WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS ALSO TAKEN FROM ME SO I CENTERED ALL MY HOPES ON MY SON ON FAIRFAX AS HE GREW OLDER HOWEVER AND AS THE CIVIL WAR CAME NEARER
6818-76332-0013 I NOTICED THAT HE TALKED MORE AND MORE IN SYMPATHY WITH THE NORTH AND THIS DISTRESSED ME TERRIBLY HOWEVER I THOUGHT IT BEST NOT TO SAY MUCH ABOUT IT TO HIM FOR HE WAS A HEADSTRONG BOY
6818-76332-0014 AND HAD ALWAYS RESENTED OPPOSITION AND I FELT SURE THAT HE WOULD SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY WHEN HE WAS OLDER I WISHED TO SEND HIM TO A SOUTHERN COLLEGE BUT HE BEGGED ME TO SEND HIM TO HARVARD
6818-76332-0015 AS HIS HEART WAS SO SET ON IT I COULDN'T DENY HIM THINKING THAT EVEN THIS WOULD MAKE LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN THE END THEN CAME THE CRISIS IN THE COUNTRY'S AFFAIRS
6818-76332-0016 AND THE CONFEDERACY WAS DECLARED I HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO CORRESPOND WITH SOUTHERN AUTHORITIES TO ARRANGE ABOUT RAISING A COMPANY FOR FAIRFAX I NEVER DOUBTED THAT HE WOULD COMPLY WITH MY WISHES BUT
6818-76332-0017 I LITTLE KNEW HIM I HARDLY NEED TO TELL YOU OF THE AWFUL DAY THAT HE CAME HOME YOU ARE ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE HISTORY OF IT THAT AFTERNOON SHORTLY AFTER HE ARRIVED
6818-76332-0018 WE HAD OUR INTERVIEW I HAVE ALWAYS POSSESSED THE MOST VIOLENT TEMPER A MORTAL HAD TO STRUGGLE WITH AND IN THOSE EARLIER YEARS WHEN I GOT INTO A RAGE IT BLINDED ME TO EVERYTHING ELSE
6818-76332-0019 TO EVERY OTHER EARTHLY CONSIDERATION AND DURING THAT INTERVIEW WELL NEED I SAY IT FAIRFAX WAS SIMPLY IMMOVABLE GENTLE AND LOVING ALWAYS
6818-76332-0020 BUT I COULD NO MORE IMPRESS HIM WITH MY WISHES THAN I COULD HAVE MOVED THE ROCK OF GIBRALTAR THE GALLING PART TO ME WAS THAT HE KEPT INSISTING HE WAS ONLY DOING WHAT WAS RIGHT RIGHT
6818-76332-0021 HOW COULD HE BE RIGHT WHEN IT WAS ALL DIRECTLY CONTRARY BUT NEVER MIND THAT NOW I HAVE LEARNED DIFFERENTLY WITH THE PASSING SORROWFUL YEARS BUT TO GO BACK
6818-76332-0022 I STOOD IT AS LONG AS I COULD AND THEN I TURNED FROM HIM DISOWNED HIM BADE HIM LEAVE THE HOUSE AT ONCE AND NEVER SEE MY FACE AGAIN AND INFORMED HIM THAT I MYSELF WOULD ABANDON THE PLACE ON THE MORROW
6818-76332-0023 AND RETURN TO THE SOUTH HE LEFT ME WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD AND WENT TO HIS ROOM I IMMEDIATELY SUMMONED THE SERVANTS AND DISMISSED THEM ON THE SPOT GIVING THEM ONLY TIME TO GET THEIR THINGS TOGETHER AND GO
6818-76332-0024 THEN I LOCKED MYSELF IN MY ROOM TILL HE WAS GONE HE CAME SEVERAL TIMES KNOCKED AT MY DOOR AND BEGGED ME TO SEE HIM BUT I WOULD NOT
6818-76332-0025 HEAVEN FORGIVE ME I WOULD NOT SO HE MUST HAVE LEFT ME THAT NOTE SHE COVERED HER EYES WITH HER HAND A MOMENT THEN SHE WENT ON
6818-76332-0026 I NEVER SAW OR KNEW OF IT TILL THIS DAY IF I HAD JUST AT THIS POINT THEY WERE ALL STARTLED BY A LOUD KNOCK COMING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE FRONT DOOR
6818-76332-0027 SO UNEXPECTED WAS THE SOUND THAT THEY COULD ONLY STARE AT EACH OTHER INQUIRINGLY WITHOUT STIRRING IN A MOMENT IT CAME AGAIN A THUMPING OF THE OLD KNOCKER ON THE FRONT INNER DOOR
6818-76332-0028 I GUESS I'D BETTER GO SAID JOYCE SOME ONE MAY HAVE SEEN THE LITTLE BOARDED UP DOOR OPEN DID YOU LEAVE IT OPEN SHE ASKED TURNING TO MISSUS COLLINGWOOD I THINK I DID
6818-76332-0029 I WAS TOO HURRIED AND NERVOUS WHEN I CAME IN TO THINK OF IT THAT'S IT THEN SOME ONE HAS SEEN IT OPEN AND HAS STOPPED TO INQUIRE IF EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT SHE HURRIED AWAY TO THE FRONT DOOR
6818-76332-0030 AND AFTER AN EFFORT SUCCEEDED IN PULLING IT OPEN A MAN A COMPLETE STRANGER TO HER STOOD OUTSIDE THEY REGARDED EACH OTHER WITH MUTUAL SURPRISE PARDON ME HE SAID
6818-76332-0031 BUT PERHAPS YOU CAN INFORM ME IS ANY ONE LIVING IN THIS HOUSE AT PRESENT WHY NO REPLIED JOYCE RATHER CONFUSEDLY THAT IS NO THE HOUSE IS EMPTY EXCEPT JUST JUST TO DAY
6818-76332-0032 OH ER I SEE THE FACT IS THE STRANGER WENT ON I WAS PASSING HERE AND NOTICED THIS OUTER DOOR OPEN WHICH SEEMED A LITTLE QUEER I USED TO KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED HERE VERY WELL INDEED
6818-76332-0033 AND I HAVE BEEN WONDERING WHETHER THE HOUSE WAS STILL IN THEIR POSSESSION IT SEEMED TO BE UNTENANTED AT HIS MENTION OF KNOWING THE FAMILY JOYCE LOOKED HIM OVER WITH CONSIDERABLY MORE INTEREST HE WAS TALL STRAIGHT AND ROBUST
6818-76332-0034 THOUGH RATHER VERGING ON THE ELDERLY HIS IRON GRAY HAIR WAS CRISPLY CURLY AND HIS DARK EYES TWINKLED OUT FROM UNDER BUSHY GRAY BROWS HIS SMILE WAS CAPTIVATING
6818-76332-0035 JOYCE DECIDED AT ONCE THAT SHE LIKED HIM OH DID YOU KNOW THE FAMILY THE THE COLLINGWOODS HE SUPPLEMENTED WITH HIS TWINKLING SMILE YES I KNEW THEM QUITE INTIMATELY
6818-76332-0036 MIGHT I PERHAPS IF IT WOULD NOT BE INTRUDING COME IN JUST A MOMENT TO LOOK ONCE MORE AT THE OLD PLACE THAT IS HE ADDED HASTILY SEEING HER HESITATE ONLY IF IT WOULD BE ENTIRELY CONVENIENT
6818-76332-0037 I DO NOT KNOW OF COURSE WHY THE HOUSE IS OPEN PERHAPS PEOPLE ARE ARE ABOUT TO PURCHASE IT JOYCE WAS FOR A MOMENT TONGUE TIED WITH PERPLEXITY SHE HATED TO REFUSE THE SIMPLE WISH OF THIS PLEASANT STRANGER
6818-76332-0038 YET HOW WAS SHE TO COMPLY WITH IT CONSIDERING THE PRESENCE OF MISSUS COLLINGWOOD AND THE ALMOST UNEXPLAINABLE POSITION OF HERSELF AND CYNTHIA WHAT WOULD HE THINK OF IT ALL WHILE SHE WAS HESITATING AN IDEA CAME TO HER
6818-76332-0039 THERE IS ONE OF THE FAMILY HERE TO DAY ON ON BUSINESS SHE SAID AT LAST IF YOU WILL GIVE ME YOUR NAME I WILL ASK IF THAT PERSON WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU OH THAT IS HARDLY WORTH WHILE
6818-76332-0040 MY NAME IS CALTHORPE BUT I'M SURE THEY WOULDN'T REMEMBER ME AFTER ALL THIS TIME AND I DO NOT WISH TO TROUBLE THEM BUT JOYCE HAD EXCUSED HERSELF AND TURNED AWAY AS SOON AS SHE HEARD THE NAME LEAVING HIM STANDING THERE
6818-76332-0041 MISSUS COLLINGWOOD HOWEVER SHOOK HER HEAD WHEN JOYCE ANNOUNCED WHO WAS OUTSIDE I DO NOT REMEMBER ANY ONE NAMED CALTHORPE AND I SCARCELY FEEL THAT I CAN SEE A STRANGER NOW
6818-76332-0042 BUT WE MUST NOT BE INHOSPITABLE MISS CYNTHIA AND I WILL GO AND SIT IN THE LIBRARY AND YOU CAN BRING HIM INTO THE DRAWING ROOM A FEW MOMENTS THERE IS NO OTHER PART OF THE HOUSE THAT CAN VERY WELL BE SHOWN
6818-76332-0043 SHE TOOK CYNTHIA'S ARM WALKED INTO THE LIBRARY AND PARTLY CLOSED THE DOOR WHILE JOYCE WENT OUT TO ADMIT THE STRANGER IF YOU CARE TO LOOK AROUND THE DRAWING ROOM YOU WILL BE MOST WELCOME SHE ANNOUNCED POLITELY
6818-76332-0044 HE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION GRATEFULLY AND ENTERED WITH HER AT THE FIRST GLANCE HOWEVER HE STARTED BACK SLIGHTLY AS WITH A SHOCK OF SURPRISE WHY HOW STRANGE HOW VERY SINGULAR HE MURMURED
6818-76332-0045 THESE CANDLES EVERYTHING EVERYTHING JUST THE SAME AS THOUGH IT WERE YESTERDAY DID YOU OFTEN COME HERE INQUIRED JOYCE YOU MUST BE VERY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE HOUSE
6818-76332-0046 YES I CAME OFTEN I WAS ALMOST LIKE AN INMATE HE BEGAN TO WANDER SLOWLY ABOUT THE ROOM EXAMINING THE PICTURES IN FRONT OF THE BABY TWINS HE PAUSED A LONG TIME
6818-76332-0047 THEN YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN YOUNG MISTER FAIRFAX VERY WELL SUGGESTED JOYCE THAT'S HE ON THE RIGHT IN THE PICTURE THE STRANGER EYED HER CURIOUSLY WHY YES I KNEW HIM WELL
6818-76332-0048 BUT YOU LITTLE LADY SEEM QUITE INTIMATE WITH THE COLLINGWOOD FAMILY HISTORY TELL ME ARE YOU A A RELATIVE THIS CONFUSED JOYCE ANEW
6818-76332-0049 BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD A GOOD DEAL ABOUT THEM AN UNHAPPY FAMILY WAS HIS ONLY COMMENT AND HE CONTINUED HIS TOUR AROUND THE ROOM
6818-76332-0050 IN FRONT OF THE OLD SQUARE OPEN PIANO HE PAUSED AGAIN AND FINGERED THE SILK SCARF THAT HAD AT SOME LONG AGO DATE BEEN THROWN CARELESSLY UPON IT THEN HE RAN HIS FINGERS LIGHTLY OVER THE YELLOW KEYS
6818-76332-0051 THE TONES WERE UNBELIEVABLY JANGLING AND DISCORDANT YET JOYCE THOUGHT SHE CAUGHT THE NOTES OF A LITTLE TUNE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT HE BROKE INTO THE AIR SINGING SOFTLY THE OPENING LINE
6818-76332-0052 HE HAD SUNG NO MORE WHEN THE FACE OF MISSUS COLLINGWOOD APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY HER EYES WERE WIDE AND STARING HER FEATURES ALMOST GRAY IN COLOR
6818-76332-0053 WHO WHO ARE YOU SHE DEMANDED IN A VOICE SCARCELY LOUDER THAN A WHISPER THE STRANGER GAZED AT HER WITH A FIXED LOOK ARTHUR
6818-76332-0054 ARTHUR CALTHORPE HE FALTERED NO YOU ARE NOT THEY DREW TOWARD EACH OTHER UNCONSCIOUSLY AS THOUGH MOVING IN A DREAM NO ONE
6818-76332-0055 MISSUS COLLINGWOOD CAME CLOSER AND UTTERED A SUDDEN LOW CRY MY SON MOTHER THE TWO GIRLS WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING THIS SCENE WITH AMAZEMENT UNUTTERABLE
6818-76332-0056 THEN WITH A BEAUTIFUL GESTURE THE MAN HELD OUT HIS ARMS AND THE WOMAN WITH A LITTLE GASP OF HAPPINESS
6836-61803-0000 IT IS NOW EVENING AND THE SUNBEAMS FALLING ASLANT INTRUDE UPON THE SPACE CANOPIED BY THE TREE FROM THE GOLDEN BRIGHTNESS DISPLAYED BY THEM AT NOON
6836-61803-0001 AS IF THERE WAS ANGER IN THE SKY IT IS BUT AN ACCIDENT OF THE ATMOSPHERE THE PORTENT OF AN APPROACHING STORM
6836-61803-0002 FOR ALL THIS IT IS REMARKED AS SINGULAR THAT A STORM SHOULD BE COMING AT THE TIME SINCE IT SYMBOLISES THE SENTIMENT OF THE SPECTATORS WHO LOOK ON WITH SULLENNESS IN THEIR HEARTS AND GLOOM IN THEIR GLANCES
6836-61803-0003 IT WOULD SEEM AS IF HEAVEN'S WRATH WAS ACTING IN CONCERT WITH THE PASSIONS OF EARTH MAURICE GERALD IS NO LONGER THE CYNOSURE OF THOSE SCOWLING EYES HE HAS BEEN CLAMOROUSLY ACQUITTED
6836-61803-0004 AND IS HENCEFORTH ONLY ONE OF THE WITNESSES IN THE PLACE LATE OCCUPIED BY HIM ANOTHER STANDS CASSIUS CALHOUN IS NOW THE PRISONER AT THE BAR
6836-61803-0005 THIS IS THE ONLY CHANGE OBSERVABLE THE JUDGE IS THE SAME THE JURY THE SAME AND THE SPECTATORS AS BEFORE THOUGH WITH VERY DIFFERENT FEELINGS IN REGARD TO THE CRIMINALITY OF THE ACCUSED
6836-61803-0006 IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BEYOND THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT THE EVIDENCE IS ALREADY BEFORE THEM AND THOUGH ENTIRELY CIRCUMSTANTIAL AS IN MOST CASES OF MURDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES FORM A CHAIN IRRESISTIBLY CONCLUSIVE AND COMPLETE
6836-61803-0007 THERE IS BUT ONE MISSING LINK IF LINK IT MAY BE CALLED THE MOTIVE THE MOTIVE BOTH FOR THE MURDER AND THE MUTILATION
6836-61803-0008 FOR THE TESTIMONY OF GERALD HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY A SUBSEQUENT EXAMINATION OF THE DEAD BODY THE SURGEON OF THE CANTONMENT HAS PRONOUNCED THE TWO DISTINCT AND THAT HENRY POINDEXTER'S DEATH
6836-61803-0009 MUST HAVE ENSUED ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY AFTER HIS RECEIVING THE SHOT WHY SHOULD CASSIUS CALHOUN HAVE KILLED HIS OWN COUSIN WHY CUT OFF HIS HEAD NO ONE CAN ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS
6836-61803-0010 SAVE THE MURDERER HIMSELF NO ONE EXPECTS HIM TO DO SO SAVE TO HIS MAKER BEFORE HIM HE MUST SOON STAND FOR A KNOWLEDGE OF THE MOTIVE IS NOT DEEMED ESSENTIAL TO HIS CONDEMNATION
6836-61803-0011 AND HE HAS BEEN CONDEMNED THE TRIAL HAS COME TO A CLOSE THE VERDICT GUILTY HAS BEEN GIVEN AND THE JUDGE LAYING ASIDE HIS PANAMA HAT IS ABOUT TO PUT ON THE BLACK CAP
6836-61803-0012 THAT DREAD EMBLEM OF DEATH PREPARATORY TO PRONOUNCING THE SENTENCE IN THE USUAL SOLEMN MANNER THE CONDEMNED MAN IS INVITED TO MAKE HIS FINAL SPEECH TO AVAIL HIMSELF AS IT WERE
6836-61803-0013 HE STARTS AT THE INVITATION FALLING AS IT DOES LIKE A DEATH KNELL UPON HIS EAR HE LOOKS WILDLY AROUND DESPAIRINGLY
6836-61803-0014 WHEN ON THE FACES THAT ENCIRCLE HIM HE SEES NOT ONE WEARING AN EXPRESSION OF SYMPATHY THERE IS NOT EVEN PITY ALL APPEAR TO FROWN UPON HIM
6836-61803-0015 HIS CONFEDERATES THOSE PAYED RUFFIANS WHO HAVE HITHERTO SUPPORTED HIM ARE OF NO USE NOW AND THEIR SYMPATHY OF NO CONSEQUENCE THEY HAVE SHRUNK OUT OF SIGHT
6836-61803-0016 BEFORE THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW AND THE DAMNING EVIDENCE OF HIS GUILT DESPITE HIS SOCIAL STANDING AND THE WEALTH TO SUSTAIN IT HE SEES HIMSELF ALONE WITHOUT FRIEND OR SYMPATHISER
6836-61803-0017 FOR SO STANDS THE ASSASSIN IN TEXAS HIS DEMEANOUR IS COMPLETELY CHANGED
6836-61803-0018 OFT EXHIBITED IN BOLD BRUTAL BULLYISM HE LOOKS COWED AND CRAVEN AND NOT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD HE FEELS THAT THERE IS NO CHANCE OF ESCAPE THAT HE IS STANDING BY THE SIDE OF HIS COFFIN
6836-61803-0019 ON THE EDGE OF AN ETERNITY TOO TERRIBLE TO CONTEMPLATE TO A CONSCIENCE LIKE HIS IT CANNOT BE OTHERWISE THAN APPALLING ALL AT ONCE A LIGHT IS SEEN TO FLASK INTO HIS EYES
6836-61803-0020 SUNKEN AS THEY ARE IN THE MIDST OF TWO LIVID CIRCLES HE HAS THE AIR OF ONE ON THE EVE OF MAKING CONFESSION IS IT TO BE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF GUILT
6836-61803-0021 IS HE ABOUT TO UNBURDEN HIS CONSCIENCE OF THE WEIGHT THAT MUST BE ON IT THE SPECTATORS GUESSING HIS INTENTION STAND BREATHLESSLY OBSERVING HIM THERE IS SILENCE EVEN AMONG THE CICADAS
6836-61803-0022 IT IS BROKEN BY THE FORMALISED INTERROGATORY OF THE JUDGE HAVE YOU ANYTHING TO SAY WHY SENTENCE OF DEATH SHOULD NOT BE PRONOUNCED UPON YOU NO HE REPLIES I HAVE NOT
6836-61803-0023 THE JURY HAS GIVEN A JUST VERDICT I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE FORFEITED MY LIFE AND DESERVE TO LOSE IT
6836-61803-0024 SHOT HIM DEAD IN THE CHAPPARAL
6836-61803-0025 AND EXPRESSES HORROR RATHER THAN INDIGNATION ALIKE INVOLUNTARY IS THE GROAN THAT GOES WITH IT PROCEEDING FROM A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL WHOM ALL KNOW TO BE THE FATHER OF THE MURDERED MAN
6836-61803-0026 ONCE MORE IN THEIR MIDST BEYOND THESE SOUNDS SOON CEASING THERE IS NOTHING TO HINDER THE CONFESSION FROM BEING CONTINUED I KNOW THAT I'VE GOT TO DIE PROCEEDS THE PRISONER WITH AN AIR OF SEEMING RECKLESSNESS
6836-61803-0027 AFTER WHAT I'VE CONFESSED IT WOULD BE FOLLY IN ME TO EXPECT PARDON AND I DON'T I'VE BEEN A BAD FELLOW AND NO DOUBT HAVE DONE ENOUGH TO DESERVE MY FATE BUT BAD AS I MAY HAVE BEEN
6836-61803-0028 IMPUTATION OF HAVING MURDERED MY OWN COUSIN I DID TAKE HIS LIFE AS I'VE TOLD YOU YOU ARE ALL ASKING WHY AND CONJECTURING ABOUT THE MOTIVE THERE WAS NONE
6836-61803-0029 A NEW SENSATION MAKES ITSELF MANIFEST AMONG THE SPECTATORS IT PARTAKES OF SURPRISE CURIOSITY AND INCREDULITY NO ONE SPEAKS OR IN ANY WAY ATTEMPTS INTERRUPTION
6836-61803-0030 YOU WONDER AT THAT IT'S EASILY EXPLAINED I KILLED HIM BY MISTAKE THE SURPRISE CULMINATES IN A SHOUT SUPPRESSED AS THE SPEAKER PROCEEDS YES BY MISTAKE
6836-61803-0031 AND GOD KNOWS I WAS SORRY ENOUGH ON DISCOVERING THAT I HAD MADE IT I DIDN'T KNOW MYSELF TILL LONG AFTER THE CONDEMNED MAN LOOKS UP AS IF IN HOPES THAT HE HAS TOUCHED A CHORD OF MERCY
6836-61803-0032 THERE IS NO SIGN OF IT ON THE FACES THAT SURROUND HIM STILL SOLEMNLY AUSTERE
6836-61803-0033 CONTINUES HE I NEEDN'T THAT I INTENDED TO KILL SOME ONE I DID NOR AM I GOING TO DENY WHO IT WAS IT WAS THE CUR I SEE STANDING BEFORE ME IN A GLANCE OF CONCENTRATED HATRED
6836-61803-0034 THE SPEAKER RESTS HIS EYE
6836-61803-0035 WHO ONLY ANSWERS WITH A LOOK SO CALM AS ALMOST TO BETRAY INDIFFERENCE YES I INTENDED TO KILL HIM I HAD MY REASONS I'M NOT GOING TO SAY WHAT THEY WERE IT'S NO USE NOW
6836-61803-0036 AND FATAL TO A FRIEND IT WAS SURE ENOUGH AND POOR HENRY DROPPED FROM HIS HORSE
6836-61803-0037 EITHER ABOUT THE MURDER OR ITS MOTIVE AND THE PRISONER IS SPARED FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THAT FIENDISH DEED THAT LEFT THE DEAD BODY OF HENRY POINDEXTER WITHOUT A HEAD
6836-61803-0038 YOU KNOW ALL THAT'S PASSED BUT NOT WHAT'S TO COME
6836-61803-0039 YOU SEE ME STANDING ON MY GRAVE
6836-61803-0040 TILL I'VE SENT HIM TO HIS I DON'T BY GOD THERE IS NO NEED TO GUESS AT THE MEANING OF THIS PROFANE SPEECH THE LAST OF CALHOUN'S LIFE ITS MEANING IS MADE CLEAR BY THE ACT THAT ACCOMPANIES IT
6836-61803-0041 WHILE SPEAKING HE HAS KEPT HIS RIGHT HAND UNDER THE LEFT BREAST OF HIS COAT ALONG WITH THE OATH IT COMES FORTH HOLDING A REVOLVER THE SPECTATORS HAVE JUST TIME TO SEE THE PISTOL
6836-61803-0042 AS IT GLINTS UNDER THE SLANTING SUNBEAMS WHEN TWO SHOTS ARE HEARD IN QUICK SUCCESSION WITH A LIKE INTERVAL BETWEEN TWO MEN FALL FORWARD UPON THEIR FACES AND LIE WITH THEIR HEADS CLOSELY CONTIGUOUS
6836-61803-0043 THE CROWD CLOSES AROUND BELIEVING BOTH TO BE DEAD
6836-61804-0000 WHO CAN BLAME HER FOR GIVING WAY TO THE SUBDUED HAPPINESS THAT SUCCEEDED NOT I NOT YOU IF YOU SPEAK TRULY THE PASSION THAT CONTROLLED HER MAY NOT BE POPULAR UNDER A STRICTLY PURITAN STANDARD
6836-61804-0001 UNIVERSAL AND IRRESISTIBLE TELLING US THAT FATHER MOTHER SISTER AND BROTHER ARE ALL TO BE FORSAKEN FOR THAT LOVE ILLIMITABLE
6836-61804-0002 DO NOT REPROACH THE YOUNG CREOLE BECAUSE THIS PASSION WAS PARAMOUNT IN HER SOUL DO NOT BLAME HER FOR FEELING PLEASURE AMIDST MOMENTS THAT SHOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO SADNESS
6836-61804-0003 NOR THAT HER HAPPINESS WAS HEIGHTENED ON LEARNING FROM THE ASTONISHED SPECTATORS HOW HER LOVER'S LIFE HAD BEEN PRESERVED AS IT MIGHT SEEM MIRACULOUSLY THE AIM OF THE ASSASSIN
6836-61804-0004 HAD BEEN TRUE ENOUGH HE MUST HAVE FELT SURE OF IT BEFORE TURNING THE MUZZLE TOWARDS HIS OWN TEMPLES AND FIRING THE BULLET THAT HAD LODGED IN HIS BRAIN
6836-61804-0005 RIGHT OVER THE HEART HE HAD HIT HIS INTENDED VICTIM AND THROUGH THE HEART WOULD THE LEADEN MISSILE HAVE MADE ITS WAY
6836-61804-0006 THE GIFT OF HER WHO ALONE COULD HAVE SECURED IT SUCH A PLACE TURNED ASIDE THE SHOT CAUSING IT TO RICOCHET NOT HARMLESSLY HOWEVER
6836-61804-0007 WITH THE MENTAL AND CORPOREAL EXCITEMENT LONG SUSTAINED DID NOT FAIL TO PRODUCE ITS EFFECT AND THE MIND OF MAURICE GERALD ONCE MORE RETURNED TO ITS DELIRIOUS DREAMING
6836-61804-0008 BUT NO LONGER LAY HIS BODY IN DANGER IN THE CHAPPARAL SURROUNDED BY WOLVES AND SHADOWED BY SOARING VULTURES IN A HUT WHERE HE WAS BUT ILL ATTENDED
6836-61804-0009 IN A JAIL WHERE HE WAS SCARCE CARED FOR AT ALL WHEN AGAIN RESTORED TO CONSCIOUSNESS IT WAS TO DISCOVER THAT THE FAIR VISION OF HIS DREAMS WAS NO VISION AT ALL BUT A LOVELY WOMAN
6836-61804-0010 THE SPIRIT OF THE ARISTOCRATIC PLANTER STEEPED IN SORROW AND HUMILIATED BY MISFORTUNE HAD BECOME PURGED OF ITS FALSE PRIDE THOUGH IT NEEDED NOT THIS TO MAKE HIM WILLINGLY ACQUIESCE IN AN ALLIANCE
6836-61804-0011 WHICH INSTEAD OF A NOBODY GAVE HIM A NOBLEMAN FOR HIS SON SUCH IN REALITY WAS SIR MAURICE GERALD ERST KNOWN AS MAURICE THE MUSTANGER IN TEXAS
6836-61804-0012 THE TITLE WOULD HAVE COUNTED FOR LITTLE NOR DID ITS OWNER CARE TO CARRY IT BUT BY A BIT OF GOOD FORTUNE NOT ALWAYS ATTENDANT ON AN IRISH BARONETCY
6836-61804-0013 IT CARRIED ALONG WITH IT AN ENDOWMENT AMPLE ENOUGH TO CLEAR CASA DEL CORVO OF THE MORTGAGE HELD BY THE LATE CASSIUS CALHOUN AND CLAIMED BY HIS NEAREST OF KIN THIS WAS NOT WOODLEY POINDEXTER
6836-61804-0014 FOR AFTER CALHOUN'S DEATH IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE EX CAPTAIN HAD ONCE BEEN A BENEDICT AND THERE WAS A YOUNG SCION OF HIS STOCK LIVING IN NEW ORLEANS WHO HAD THE LEGAL RIGHT TO SAY HE WAS HIS SON
6836-61804-0015 IT MATTERED NOT TO MAURICE GERALD WHO NOW CLEAR OF EVERY ENTANGLEMENT BECAME THE HUSBAND OF THE FAIR CREOLE AFTER A VISIT TO HIS NATIVE LAND INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN TOUR
6836-61804-0016 LOUISE POINDEXTER LADY GERALD SHE MUST NOW BE CALLED DURING HER SOJOURN IN THE EMERALD ISLE SAW NOTHING TO EXCITE HER TO JEALOUSY ONLY ONCE AGAIN DID THIS FELL PASSION
6836-61804-0017 TAKE POSSESSION OF HER SPIRIT AND THEN ONLY IN THE SHAPE OF A SHADOW SOON TO PASS AWAY IT WAS ONE DAY WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME HOME TO THE HACIENDA BEARING IN HIS ARMS THE BODY OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
6836-61804-0018 NOT YET DEAD THOUGH THE BLOOD STREAMING FROM A WOUND IN HER BARED BOSOM SHOWED SHE HAD NOT LONG TO LIVE TO THE QUESTION WHO HAS DONE THIS SHE WAS ONLY ABLE TO ANSWER DIAZ
6836-61804-0019 DIAZ IT WAS THE LAST UTTERANCE OF
6836-61804-0020 COVARUBIO DE LOS LLANOS AS THE SPIRIT OF THE UNHAPPY SENORITA PASSED INTO ETERNITY
6836-61804-0021 WHOSE STORY SHE NOW BETTER COMPREHENDED SHE EVEN ASSISTED HER LORD IN THE SADDLING OF HIS RED BAY STEED AND ENCOURAGED HIM IN THE PURSUIT OF THE ASSASSIN
6836-61804-0022 SHE JOYED TO SEE THE LATTER LED BACK AT THE END OF A LAZO HELD IN THE HAND OF HER HUSBAND AND REFUSED TO INTERFERE WHEN A BAND OF REGULATORS CALLED HASTILY TOGETHER
6836-61804-0023 DEALT OUT SUMMARY CHASTISEMENT BY HANGING HIM TO A TREE IT WAS NOT CRUELTY ONLY A CRUDE KIND OF JUSTICE AN EYE FOR AN EYE AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH
6836-61804-0024 AND WHAT A POOR COMPENSATION IT SEEMED TO THOSE WHO HAD TAKEN PART IN EXACTING IT AS THEY STOOD GAZING UPON THE REMAINS OF THE VILLAIN AND HIS VICTIM THE SWARTH RUFFIAN DANGLING FROM THE BRANCH ABOVE
6836-61804-0025 AND THE FAIR FORM LYING UNDERNEATH THE HEARTS OF THE TEXANS WERE TOUCHED AS PERHAPS THEY HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE THERE WAS A STRANGE THOUGHT PASSING THROUGH THEIR MINDS
6836-61804-0026 A SADNESS INDEPENDENT OF THAT CAUSED BY THE SPECTACLE OF A MURDER IT WAS REGRET AT HAVING SO HASTILY DESPATCHED THE ASSASSIN BEAUTIFUL EVEN IN DEATH WAS ISIDORA SUCH FEATURES AS SHE POSSESSED
6836-61804-0027 AT LENGTH GOING WITH THOUGHTS NOT ALTOGETHER SACRED IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD TIME IS ACCOUNTED THE DESTROYER THOUGH IN THE MORAL IT IS OFT THE RESTORER
6836-61804-0028 NOWHERE HAS IT EFFECTED GREATER CHANGES THAN IN TEXAS DURING THE LAST DECADE AND ESPECIALLY

6836-76549-0004 HAS HAD AN EXTRA STOUT BONE SHAKER MADE TO ORDER

6836-76549-0024 IS POPULARLY BELIEVED BY MANY OF ITS NUMEROUS LOCAL ADMIRERS TO BE THE HIGHEST NAVIGABLE LAKE IN THE WORLD IF SO HOWEVER LAKE TAHOE IN THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS COMES NEXT

6880-216547-0000 THE FOLLOWING LETTER SERVED AS A PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION OF THIS MEMOIR
6880-216547-0001 PARIS JUNE THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN FORTY GENTLEMEN IN THE COURSE OF YOUR DEBATE OF THE NINTH OF MAY EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE IN REGARD TO THE TRIENNIAL PENSION ESTABLISHED BY MADAME SUARD
6880-216547-0002 YOU EXPRESSED THE FOLLOWING WISH THE ACADEMY REQUESTS THE TITULARY TO PRESENT IT ANNUALLY DURING THE FIRST FORTNIGHT IN JULY WITH A SUCCINCT AND LOGICAL STATEMENT OF THE VARIOUS STUDIES WHICH HE HAS PURSUED DURING THE YEAR
6880-216547-0003 WHICH HAS JUST EXPIRED I NOW PROPOSE GENTLEMEN TO DISCHARGE THIS DUTY
6880-216547-0004 WHEN I SOLICITED YOUR VOTES I BOLDLY AVOWED MY INTENTION TO BEND MY EFFORTS TO THE DISCOVERY OF SOME MEANS OF AMELIORATING THE PHYSICAL
6880-216547-0005 MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL CONDITION OF THE MERE NUMEROUS AND POORER CLASSES THIS IDEA FOREIGN AS IT MAY HAVE SEEMED TO THE OBJECT OF MY CANDIDACY YOU RECEIVED FAVORABLY
6880-216547-0006 YOU CHANGED THIS FORMAL OFFER INTO AN INVIOLABLE AND SACRED OBLIGATION THENCEFORTH I UNDERSTOOD WITH HOW WORTHY AND HONORABLE A SOCIETY I HAD TO DEAL MY REGARD FOR ITS ENLIGHTENMENT MY RECOGNITION OF ITS BENEFITS
6880-216547-0007 MY ENTHUSIASM FOR ITS GLORY WERE UNBOUNDED CONVINCED AT ONCE THAT IN ORDER TO BREAK LOOSE FROM THE BEATEN PATHS OF OPINIONS AND SYSTEMS IT WAS NECESSARY TO PROCEED IN MY STUDY OF MAN AND SOCIETY
6880-216547-0008 BY SCIENTIFIC METHODS AND IN A RIGOROUS MANNER I DEVOTED ONE YEAR TO PHILOLOGY AND GRAMMAR LINGUISTICS OR THE NATURAL HISTORY OF SPEECH BEING OF ALL THE SCIENCES THAT
6880-216547-0009 SEEMED TO BEAR THE CLOSEST RELATION TO THE RESEARCHES WHICH I WAS ABOUT TO COMMENCE
6880-216547-0010 IF IT DID NOT REVEAL THE ASTONISHING SUCCESS AT LEAST BORE WITNESS TO THE THOROUGHNESS OF MY LABORS SINCE THAT TIME METAPHYSICS AND MORAL SCIENCE HAVE BEEN MY ONLY STUDIES
6880-216547-0011 MY PERCEPTION OF THE FACT THAT THESE SCIENCES THOUGH BADLY DEFINED AS TO THEIR OBJECT AND NOT CONFINED TO THEIR SPHERE ARE LIKE THE NATURAL SCIENCES SUSCEPTIBLE OF DEMONSTRATION AND CERTAINTY
6880-216547-0012 HAS ALREADY REWARDED MY EFFORTS BUT GENTLEMEN OF ALL THE MASTERS WHOM I HAVE FOLLOWED TO NONE DO I OWE SO MUCH AS TO YOU
6880-216547-0013 YOUR CO OPERATION YOUR PROGRAMMES YOUR INSTRUCTIONS IN AGREEMENT WITH MY SECRET WISHES AND MOST CHERISHED HOPES HAVE AT NO TIME FAILED TO ENLIGHTEN ME AND TO POINT OUT MY ROAD THIS MEMOIR ON PROPERTY
6880-216547-0014 IS THE CHILD OF YOUR THOUGHT
6880-216547-0015 TO WHAT CAUSES MUST WE ATTRIBUTE THE CONTINUALLY INCREASING NUMBER OF SUICIDES AND WHAT ARE THE PROPER MEANS FOR ARRESTING THE EFFECTS OF THIS MORAL CONTAGION
6880-216547-0016 THEREBY IT ASKED IN LESS GENERAL TERMS WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THE SOCIAL EVIL AND WHAT WAS ITS REMEDY YOU ADMITTED THAT YOURSELVES GENTLEMEN
6880-216547-0017 WHEN YOUR COMMITTEE REPORTED THAT THE COMPETITORS HAD ENUMERATED WITH EXACTNESS THE IMMEDIATE AND PARTICULAR CAUSES OF SUICIDE AS WELL AS THE MEANS OF PREVENTING EACH OF THEM BUT THAT FROM THIS ENUMERATION
6880-216547-0018 CHRONICLED WITH MORE OR LESS SKILL NO POSITIVE INFORMATION HAD BEEN GAINED EITHER AS TO THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE EVIL OR AS TO ITS REMEDY IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
6880-216547-0019 YOUR PROGRAMME ALWAYS ORIGINAL AND VARIED IN ITS ACADEMICAL EXPRESSION BECAME MORE EXACT THE INVESTIGATIONS OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT HAD POINTED OUT AS THE CAUSES OR RATHER AS THE SYMPTOMS OF THE SOCIAL MALADY
6880-216547-0020 THE NEGLECT OF THE PRINCIPLES OF RELIGION AND MORALITY THE DESIRE FOR WEALTH THE PASSION FOR ENJOYMENT AND POLITICAL DISTURBANCES ALL THESE DATA WERE EMBODIED BY YOU IN A SINGLE PROPOSITION
6880-216547-0021 THE UTILITY OF THE CELEBRATION OF SUNDAY AS REGARDS HYGIENE MORALITY AND SOCIAL AND POLITICAL RELATION IN A CHRISTIAN TONGUE YOU ASKED GENTLEMEN
6880-216547-0022 WHAT WAS THE TRUE SYSTEM OF SOCIETY A COMPETITOR
6880-216547-0023 DARED TO MAINTAIN AND BELIEVED THAT HE HAD PROVED THAT THE INSTITUTION OF A DAY OF REST AT WEEKLY INTERVALS IS INSEPARABLY BOUND UP WITH A POLITICAL SYSTEM BASED ON THE EQUALITY OF CONDITIONS
6880-216547-0024 THAT WITHOUT EQUALITY THIS INSTITUTION IS AN ANOMALY AND AN IMPOSSIBILITY THAT EQUALITY ALONE CAN REVIVE THIS ANCIENT AND MYSTERIOUS KEEPING OF THE SEVENTH DAY
6880-216547-0025 THIS ARGUMENT DID NOT MEET WITH YOUR APPROBATION SINCE WITHOUT DENYING THE RELATION POINTED OUT BY THE COMPETITOR YOU JUDGED AND RIGHTLY GENTLEMEN
6880-216547-0026 THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY OF CONDITIONS NOT BEING DEMONSTRATED THE IDEAS OF THE AUTHOR WERE NOTHING MORE THAN HYPOTHESES FINALLY GENTLEMEN
6880-216547-0027 THIS FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY YOU PRESENTED FOR COMPETITION IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS
6880-216547-0028 THE ECONOMICAL AND MORAL CONSEQUENCES IN FRANCE UP TO THE PRESENT TIME AND THOSE WHICH SEEM LIKELY TO APPEAR IN FUTURE OF THE LAW CONCERNING THE EQUAL DIVISION OF HEREDITARY PROPERTY BETWEEN THE CHILDREN
6880-216547-0029 INSTEAD OF CONFINING ONE TO COMMON PLACES WITHOUT BREADTH OR SIGNIFICANCE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOUR QUESTION SHOULD BE DEVELOPED AS FOLLOWS
6880-216547-0030 CAN IT NOT RENDER IT EQUAL FOR ALL HIS GRANDCHILDREN AND GREAT GRANDCHILDREN IF THE LAW NO LONGER HEEDS THE AGE OF ANY MEMBER OF THE FAMILY CAN IT NOT BY THE RIGHT OF HEREDITY
6880-216547-0031 CEASE TO HEED IT IN THE RACE IN THE TRIBE IN THE NATION CAN EQUALITY BY THE RIGHT OF SUCCESSION BE PRESERVED BETWEEN CITIZENS AS WELL AS BETWEEN COUSINS AND BROTHERS
6880-216547-0032 IN A WORD CAN THE PRINCIPLE OF SUCCESSION BECOME A PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY TO SUM UP ALL THESE IDEAS IN ONE INCLUSIVE QUESTION WHAT IS THE PRINCIPLE OF HEREDITY
6880-216547-0033 WHAT ARE THE FOUNDATIONS OF INEQUALITY WHAT IS PROPERTY SUCH GENTLEMEN IS THE OBJECT OF THE MEMOIR THAT I OFFER YOU TO DAY
6880-216547-0034 IF I HAVE RIGHTLY GRASPED THE OBJECT OF YOUR THOUGHT IF I SUCCEED IN BRINGING TO LIGHT A TRUTH WHICH IS INDISPUTABLE BUT FROM CAUSES WHICH I AM BOLD ENOUGH TO CLAIM TO HAVE EXPLAINED
6880-216547-0035 HAS ALWAYS BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD IF BY AN INFALLIBLE METHOD OF INVESTIGATION I ESTABLISH THE DOGMA OF EQUALITY OF CONDITIONS IF I DETERMINE THE PRINCIPLE OF CIVIL LAW THE ESSENCE OF JUSTICE AND THE FORM OF SOCIETY
6880-216547-0036 TO YOU GENTLEMEN WILL REDOUND ALL THE GLORY FOR IT IS TO YOUR AID AND YOUR INSPIRATION THAT I OWE IT MY PURPOSE IN THIS WORK IS THE APPLICATION OF METHOD
6880-216547-0037 TO THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY EVERY OTHER INTENTION IS FOREIGN TO AND EVEN ABUSIVE OF IT I HAVE SPOKEN LIGHTLY OF JURISPRUDENCE I HAD THE RIGHT
6880-216547-0038 BUT I SHOULD BE UNJUST DID I NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THIS PRETENDED SCIENCE AND THE MEN WHO PRACTISE IT DEVOTED TO STUDIES BOTH LABORIOUS AND SEVERE
6880-216547-0039 ENTITLED IN ALL RESPECTS TO THE ESTEEM OF THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS BY THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND ELOQUENCE OUR LEGISTS DESERVE BUT ONE REPROACH THAT OF AN EXCESSIVE DEFERENCE TO ARBITRARY LAWS
6880-216547-0040 AND THEIR UNWARRANTED BLUNDERS HAVE DISGUSTED ME WHOEVER KNOWING THEM PARDONS THEM MAY READ THEM I HAVE SEVERELY BLAMED THE LEARNED CHRISTIAN CHURCH
6880-216547-0041 IT WAS MY DUTY THIS BLAME RESULTS FROM THE FACTS WHICH I CALL ATTENTION TO WHY HAS THE CHURCH DECREED CONCERNING THINGS WHICH IT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND
6880-216547-0042 THE CHURCH HAS ERRED IN DOGMA AND IN MORALS PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS TESTIFY AGAINST HER IT MAY BE WRONG FOR ME TO SAY IT BUT SURELY IT IS UNFORTUNATE FOR CHRISTIANITY THAT IT IS TRUE
6880-216547-0043 TO RESTORE RELIGION GENTLEMEN IT IS NECESSARY TO CONDEMN THE CHURCH PERHAPS YOU WILL REGRET GENTLEMEN THAT IN GIVING ALL MY ATTENTION TO METHOD AND EVIDENCE
6880-216547-0044 I HAVE TOO MUCH NEGLECTED FORM AND STYLE IN VAIN SHOULD I HAVE TRIED TO DO BETTER LITERARY HOPE AND FAITH I HAVE NONE
6880-216547-0045 THAT IS THE REASON IN MY OPINION WHY AMONG SO MANY MEN OF TALENT FRANCE TO DAY COUNTS NOT ONE GREAT WRITER
6880-216547-0046 IN A SOCIETY LIKE OURS TO SEEK FOR LITERARY GLORY SEEMS TO ME AN ANACHRONISM OF WHAT USE IS IT TO INVOKE AN ANCIENT SIBYL WHEN A MUSE IS ON THE EVE OF BIRTH
6880-216547-0047 PITIABLE ACTORS IN A TRAGEDY NEARING ITS END THAT WHICH IT BEHOOVES US TO DO IS TO PRECIPITATE THE CATASTROPHE THE MOST DESERVING AMONG US IS HE WHO PLAYS BEST THIS PART WELL
6880-216547-0048 I NO LONGER ASPIRE TO THIS SAD SUCCESS WHY SHOULD I NOT CONFESS IT GENTLEMEN I HAVE ASPIRED TO YOUR SUFFRAGES AND SOUGHT THE TITLE OF YOUR PENSIONER HATING ALL WHICH EXISTS AND FULL OF PROJECTS FOR ITS DESTRUCTION
6880-216547-0049 AND THE MOST PRECIOUS FRUIT THAT I COULD WISH TO GATHER FROM THIS MEMOIR WOULD BE THE INSPIRATION OF MY READERS WITH THAT TRANQUILLITY OF SOUL WHICH ARISES FROM THE CLEAR PERCEPTION OF EVIL AND ITS CAUSE
6880-216547-0050 AND WHICH IS MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN PASSION AND ENTHUSIASM MY HATRED OF PRIVILEGE AND HUMAN AUTHORITY WAS UNBOUNDED PERHAPS AT TIMES I HAVE BEEN GUILTY IN MY INDIGNATION
6880-216547-0051 OF CONFOUNDING PERSONS AND THINGS AT PRESENT I CAN ONLY DESPISE AND COMPLAIN TO CEASE TO HATE I ONLY NEEDED TO KNOW
6880-216547-0052 IT IS FOR YOU NOW GENTLEMEN WHOSE MISSION AND CHARACTER ARE THE PROCLAMATION OF THE TRUTH IT IS FOR YOU TO INSTRUCT THE PEOPLE AND TO TELL THEM FOR WHAT THEY OUGHT TO HOPE
6880-216547-0053 AND WHAT THEY OUGHT TO FEAR THE PEOPLE INCAPABLE AS YET OF SOUND JUDGMENT AS TO WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM APPLAUD INDISCRIMINATELY THE MOST OPPOSITE IDEAS PROVIDED THAT IN THEM THEY GET A TASTE OF FLATTERY
6880-216547-0054 TO THEM THE LAWS OF THOUGHT ARE LIKE THE CONFINES OF THE POSSIBLE TO DAY THEY CAN NO MORE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A SAVANT AND A SOPHIST THAN FORMERLY THEY COULD TELL A PHYSICIAN FROM A SORCERER
6880-216547-0055 INCONSIDERATELY ACCEPTING GATHERING TOGETHER AND ACCUMULATING EVERYTHING THAT IS NEW REGARDING ALL REPORTS AS TRUE
6880-216547-0056 THEY ASSEMBLE LIKE BEES AT THE SOUND OF A BASIN
6880-216547-0057 MAY YOU GENTLEMEN DESIRE EQUALITY AS I MYSELF DESIRE IT MAY YOU FOR THE ETERNAL HAPPINESS OF OUR COUNTRY BECOME ITS PROPAGATORS AND ITS HERALDS
6880-216547-0058 MAY I BE THE LAST OF YOUR PENSIONERS OF ALL THE WISHES THAT I CAN FRAME THAT GENTLEMEN IS THE MOST WORTHY OF YOU AND THE MOST HONORABLE FOR ME
6880-216547-0059 TWO MONTHS AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THIS LETTER THE ACADEMY IN ITS DEBATE OF AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH REPLIED TO THE ADDRESS OF ITS PENSIONER BY A NOTE THE TEXT OF WHICH I GIVE BELOW
6880-216547-0060 PUBLISHED LAST JUNE BY THE TITULARY OF THE SUARD PENSION ENTITLED WHAT IS PROPERTY AND DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR TO THE ACADEMY HE IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE SOCIETY OWES IT TO JUSTICE
6880-216547-0061 TO EXAMPLE AND TO ITS OWN DIGNITY TO PUBLICLY DISAVOW ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ANTI SOCIAL DOCTRINES CONTAINED IN THIS PUBLICATION IN CONSEQUENCE HE DEMANDS
6880-216547-0062 IN THE MOST FORMAL MANNER THE WORK OF THE SUARD PENSIONER AS HAVING BEEN PUBLISHED WITHOUT ITS ASSENT AND AS ATTRIBUTING TO IT OPINIONS DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED TO THE PRINCIPLES OF EACH OF ITS MEMBERS
6880-216547-0063 IN CASE HE SHOULD PUBLISH A SECOND EDITION OF HIS BOOK TO OMIT THE DEDICATION
6880-216547-0064 THAT THIS JUDGMENT OF THE ACADEMY BE PLACED UPON THE RECORDS THESE THREE PROPOSITIONS PUT TO VOTE ARE ADOPTED
6880-216547-0065 AFTER THIS LUDICROUS DECREE WHICH ITS AUTHORS THOUGHT TO RENDER POWERFUL BY GIVING IT THE FORM OF A CONTRADICTION
6880-216547-0066 I CAN ONLY BEG THE READER NOT TO MEASURE THE INTELLIGENCE OF MY COMPATRIOTS BY THAT OF OUR ACADEMY WHILE MY PATRONS IN THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SCIENCES WERE FULMINATING ANATHEMAS AGAINST MY BROCHURE
6880-216547-0067 WHO DID NOT KNOW ME WHO MIGHT EVEN HAVE REGARDED HIMSELF AS PERSONALLY ATTACKED BY THE TOO SHARP JUDGMENT WHICH I HAD PASSED UPON THE ECONOMISTS A PUBLICIST AS LEARNED AS HE WAS MODEST LOVED BY THE PEOPLE WHOSE SORROWS HE FELT
6880-216547-0068 HONORED BY THE POWER WHICH HE SOUGHT TO ENLIGHTEN WITHOUT FLATTERING OR DISGRACING IT
6880-216547-0069 MEMBER OF THE INSTITUTE PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL ECONOMY DEFENDER OF PROPERTY TOOK UP MY DEFENCE BEFORE HIS ASSOCIATES AND BEFORE THE MINISTRY
6880-216547-0070 AND SAVED ME FROM THE BLOWS OF A JUSTICE WHICH IS ALWAYS BLIND BECAUSE IT IS ALWAYS IGNORANT
6880-216547-0071 A LETTER AS HONORABLE TO ITS AUTHOR AS IT IS FLATTERING TO HIM TO WHOM IT IS ADDRESSED PARIS MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN FORTY ONE MONSIEUR
6880-216547-0072 I HASTEN TO THANK YOU FOR FORWARDING TO ME YOUR SECOND MEMOIR UPON PROPERTY I HAVE READ IT WITH ALL THE INTEREST THAT AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE FIRST WOULD NATURALLY INSPIRE I AM VERY GLAD THAT YOU HAVE MODIFIED SOMEWHAT
6880-216547-0073 THE RUDENESS OF FORM WHICH GAVE TO A WORK OF SUCH GRAVITY THE MANNER AND APPEARANCE OF A PAMPHLET FOR YOU QUITE FRIGHTENED ME SIR AND YOUR TALENT WAS NEEDED TO REASSURE ME IN REGARD TO YOUR INTENTIONS
6880-216547-0074 THIS PROPOSITION NOW COMING INTO NOTICE PROPERTY IS ROBBERY WAS OF A NATURE TO REPEL FROM YOUR BOOK EVEN THOSE SERIOUS MINDS WHO DO NOT JUDGE BY APPEARANCES HAD YOU PERSISTED IN MAINTAINING IT
6880-216547-0075 IN ITS RUDE SIMPLICITY BUT IF YOU HAVE SOFTENED THE FORM YOU ARE NONE THE LESS FAITHFUL TO THE GROUND WORK OF YOUR DOCTRINES AND ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE DONE ME THE HONOR TO GIVE ME A SHARE IN THIS PERILOUS TEACHING
6880-216547-0076 I CANNOT ACCEPT A PARTNERSHIP WHICH AS FAR AS TALENT GOES WOULD SURELY BE A CREDIT TO ME BUT WHICH WOULD COMPROMISE ME IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS I AGREE WITH YOU IN ONE THING ONLY
6880-216547-0077 NAMELY THAT ALL KINDS OF PROPERTY GET TOO FREQUENTLY ABUSED IN THIS WORLD BUT I DO NOT REASON FROM THE ABUSE TO THE ABOLITION AN HEROIC REMEDY TOO MUCH LIKE DEATH
6880-216547-0078 WHICH CURES ALL EVILS I WILL GO FARTHER I WILL CONFESS THAT OF ALL ABUSES THE MOST HATEFUL TO ME ARE THOSE OF PROPERTY BUT ONCE MORE
6880-216547-0079 THERE IS A REMEDY FOR THIS EVIL WITHOUT VIOLATING IT ALL THE MORE WITHOUT DESTROYING IT IF THE PRESENT LAWS ALLOW ABUSE WE CAN RECONSTRUCT THEM OUR CIVIL CODE IS NOT THE KORAN
6880-216547-0080 IT IS NOT WRONG TO EXAMINE IT CHANGE THEN THE LAWS WHICH GOVERN THE USE OF PROPERTY BUT BE SPARING OF ANATHEMAS FOR LOGICALLY WHERE IS THE HONEST MAN WHOSE HANDS ARE ENTIRELY CLEAN
6880-216547-0081 DO YOU THINK THAT ONE CAN BE A ROBBER WITHOUT KNOWING IT WITHOUT WISHING IT WITHOUT SUSPECTING IT DO YOU NOT ADMIT THAT SOCIETY IN ITS PRESENT STATE LIKE EVERY MAN
6880-216547-0082 HAS IN ITS CONSTITUTION ALL KINDS OF VIRTUES AND VICES INHERITED FROM OUR ANCESTORS IS PROPERTY THEN IN YOUR EYES A THING SO SIMPLE AND SO ABSTRACT THAT YOU CAN RE KNEAD AND EQUALIZE IT
6880-216547-0083 IF I MAY SO SPEAK IN YOUR METAPHYSICAL MILL ONE WHO HAS SAID AS MANY EXCELLENT AND PRACTICAL THINGS AS OCCUR IN THESE TWO BEAUTIFUL AND PARADOXICAL IMPROVISATIONS OF YOURS CANNOT BE A PURE AND UNWAVERING UTOPIST
6880-216547-0084 YOU ARE TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE ECONOMICAL AND ACADEMICAL PHRASEOLOGY TO PLAY WITH THE HARD WORDS OF REVOLUTIONS I BELIEVE THEN THAT YOU HAVE HANDLED PROPERTY
6880-216547-0085 AS ROUSSEAU EIGHTY YEARS AGO HANDLED LETTERS WITH A MAGNIFICENT AND POETICAL DISPLAY OF WIT AND KNOWLEDGE SUCH AT LEAST IS MY OPINION
6880-216547-0086 THAT IS WHAT I SAID TO THE INSTITUTE AT THE TIME WHEN I PRESENTED MY REPORT UPON YOUR BOOK I KNEW THAT THEY WISHED TO PROCEED AGAINST YOU IN THE COURTS YOU PERHAPS DO NOT KNOW BY HOW NARROW A CHANCE I SUCCEEDED IN PREVENTING THEM
6880-216547-0087 WHAT CHAGRIN I SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE FELT IF THE KING'S COUNSEL THAT IS TO SAY THE INTELLECTUAL EXECUTIONER HAD FOLLOWED IN MY VERY TRACKS TO ATTACK YOUR BOOK AND ANNOY YOUR PERSON
6880-216547-0088 I ACTUALLY PASSED TWO TERRIBLE NIGHTS AND I SUCCEEDED IN RESTRAINING THE SECULAR ARM ONLY BY SHOWING THAT YOUR BOOK WAS AN ACADEMICAL DISSERTATION AND NOT THE MANIFESTO OF AN INCENDIARY
6880-216547-0089 YOUR STYLE IS TOO LOFTY EVER TO BE OF SERVICE TO THE MADMEN WHO IN DISCUSSING THE GRAVEST QUESTIONS OF OUR SOCIAL ORDER USE PAVING STONES AS THEIR WEAPONS
6880-216547-0090 BUT SEE TO IT SIR THAT ERE LONG THEY DO NOT COME IN SPITE OF YOU TO SEEK FOR AMMUNITION IN THIS FORMIDABLE ARSENAL AND THAT YOUR VIGOROUS METAPHYSICS FALLS NOT INTO THE HANDS OF SOME SOPHIST OF THE MARKET PLACE
6880-216547-0091 WHO MIGHT DISCUSS THE QUESTION IN THE PRESENCE OF A STARVING AUDIENCE WE SHOULD HAVE PILLAGE FOR CONCLUSION AND PERORATION
6880-216547-0092 BUT THE MAJESTIC AND IMPOSING ORDER OF HUMAN SOCIETIES THAT I SOMETIMES FIND MYSELF EMBARRASSED IN ATTACKING CERTAIN ABUSES I LIKE TO REBUILD WITH ONE HAND WHEN I AM COMPELLED TO DESTROY WITH THE OTHER
6880-216547-0093 IN PRUNING AN OLD TREE WE GUARD AGAINST DESTRUCTION OF THE BUDS AND FRUIT YOU KNOW THAT AS WELL AS ANY ONE YOU ARE A WISE AND LEARNED MAN YOU HAVE A THOUGHTFUL MIND
6880-216547-0094 THE TERMS BY WHICH YOU CHARACTERIZE THE FANATICS OF OUR DAY ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO REASSURE THE MOST SUSPICIOUS IMAGINATIONS AS TO YOUR INTENTIONS BUT YOU CONCLUDE
6880-216547-0095 IN FAVOR OF THE ABOLITION OF PROPERTY YOU WISH TO ABOLISH THE MOST POWERFUL MOTOR OF THE HUMAN MIND YOU ATTACK THE PATERNAL SENTIMENT IN ITS SWEETEST ILLUSIONS WITH ONE WORD YOU ARREST THE FORMATION OF CAPITAL
6880-216547-0096 AND WE BUILD HENCEFORTH UPON THE SAND INSTEAD OF ON A ROCK THAT I CANNOT AGREE TO AND FOR THAT REASON I HAVE CRITICISED YOUR BOOK SO FULL OF BEAUTIFUL PAGES
6880-216547-0097 SO BRILLIANT WITH KNOWLEDGE AND FERVOR I WISH SIR THAT MY IMPAIRED HEALTH WOULD PERMIT ME TO EXAMINE WITH YOU PAGE BY PAGE THE MEMOIR WHICH YOU HAVE DONE ME THE HONOR TO ADDRESS TO ME PUBLICLY AND PERSONALLY
6880-216547-0098 I DESIRE ALSO THE MERIT OF PRUDENCE YOU KNOW HOW DEEP SEATED IS THE DISEASE UNDER WHICH THE WORKING PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING I KNOW HOW MANY NOBLE HEARTS BEAT UNDER THOSE RUDE GARMENTS
6880-216547-0099 WHO RISE EARLY IN THE MORNING TO LABOR TO PAY THEIR TAXES AND TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY STRONG I TRY TO SERVE AND ENLIGHTEN THEM WHEREAS SOME ENDEAVOR TO MISLEAD THEM
6880-216547-0100 YOU HAVE NOT WRITTEN DIRECTLY FOR THEM YOU HAVE ISSUED TWO MAGNIFICENT MANIFESTOES THE SECOND MORE GUARDED THAN THE FIRST ISSUE A THIRD MORE GUARDED THAN THE SECOND
6880-216547-0101 AND YOU WILL TAKE HIGH RANK IN SCIENCE WHOSE FIRST PRECEPT IS CALMNESS AND IMPARTIALITY FAREWELL SIR NO MAN'S ESTEEM FOR ANOTHER CAN EXCEED MINE FOR YOU BLANQUI
6880-216547-0102 I SHOULD CERTAINLY TAKE SOME EXCEPTIONS TO THIS NOBLE AND ELOQUENT LETTER BUT I CONFESS THAT I AM MORE INCLINED TO REALIZE THE PREDICTION WITH WHICH IT TERMINATES THAN TO AUGMENT NEEDLESSLY THE NUMBER OF MY ANTAGONISTS
6880-216547-0103 SO MUCH CONTROVERSY FATIGUES AND WEARIES ME THE INTELLIGENCE EXPENDED IN THE WARFARE OF WORDS IS LIKE THAT EMPLOYED IN BATTLE IT IS INTELLIGENCE WASTED
6880-216547-0104 I CALL PROPERTY
6880-216547-0105 TO EACH OF US PROPERTY SEEMS A POLYGON WHOSE ANGLES NEED KNOCKING OFF BUT THE OPERATION PERFORMED
6880-216547-0106 AN HYPOTHESIS ADMITTED IN MATHEMATICS ALTHOUGH NOT PROVEN WHILE I CONSIDER THAT THIS FIGURE WILL BE A CIRCLE HONEST PEOPLE CAN AT LEAST UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER
6880-216547-0107 FOR THE REST I ALLOW THAT IN THE PRESENT STATE OF THE QUESTION THE MIND MAY LEGITIMATELY HESITATE BEFORE DECIDING IN FAVOR OF THE ABOLITION OF PROPERTY
6880-216547-0108 TO GAIN THE VICTORY FOR ONE'S CAUSE IT DOES NOT SUFFICE SIMPLY TO OVERTHROW A PRINCIPLE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED WHICH HAS THE INDISPUTABLE MERIT OF SYSTEMATICALLY RECAPITULATING OUR POLITICAL THEORIES
6880-216547-0109 IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH THE OPPOSITE PRINCIPLE AND TO FORMULATE THE SYSTEM WHICH MUST PROCEED FROM IT STILL FURTHER IT IS NECESSARY TO SHOW THE METHOD BY WHICH THE NEW SYSTEM
6880-216547-0110 WILL SATISFY ALL THE MORAL AND POLITICAL NEEDS WHICH INDUCED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FIRST ON THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS THEN OF SUBSEQUENT EVIDENCE DEPENDS THE CORRECTNESS OF MY PRECEDING ARGUMENTS
6880-216547-0111 THE DISCOVERY OF A SYSTEM OF ABSOLUTE EQUALITY IN WHICH ALL EXISTING INSTITUTIONS SAVE PROPERTY OR THE SUM OF THE ABUSES OF PROPERTY
6880-216547-0112 NOT ONLY MAY FIND A PLACE BUT MAY THEMSELVES SERVE AS INSTRUMENTS OF EQUALITY INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY THE DIVISION OF POWER THE PUBLIC MINISTRY THE JURY SYSTEM
6880-216547-0113 ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL ORGANIZATION THE UNITY AND COMPLETENESS OF INSTRUCTION MARRIAGE THE FAMILY HEREDITY IN DIRECT AND COLLATERAL SUCCESSION THE RIGHT OF SALE AND EXCHANGE THE RIGHT TO MAKE A WILL AND EVEN BIRTHRIGHT
6880-216547-0114 A SYSTEM WHICH BETTER THAN PROPERTY GUARANTEES THE FORMATION OF CAPITAL AND KEEPS UP THE COURAGE OF ALL
6880-216547-0115 THE ROAD THAT HE SHALL TRAVERSE WILL SUFFICE TO SHOW THE END
6925-80680-0000 ONE HOT NIGHT IN HINDUSTAN A KING AND QUEEN LAY AWAKE IN THE PALACE IN THE MIDST OF THE CITY EVERY NOW AND THEN A FAINT AIR BLEW THROUGH THE LATTICE AND THEY HOPED THEY WERE GOING TO SLEEP BUT THEY NEVER DID PRESENTLY THEY BECAME MORE BROAD AWAKE THAN EVER
6925-80680-0001 AT THE SOUND OF A HOWL OUTSIDE THE PALACE LISTEN TO THAT TIGER REMARKED THE KING TIGER REPLIED THE QUEEN HOW SHOULD THERE BE A TIGER INSIDE THE CITY IT WAS ONLY A JACKAL I TELL YOU IT WAS A TIGER SAID THE KING AND I TELL YOU THAT YOU WERE DREAMING
6925-80680-0002 IF YOU THOUGHT IT WAS ANYTHING BUT A JACKAL ANSWERED THE QUEEN I SAY IT WAS A TIGER CRIED THE KING DON'T CONTRADICT ME NONSENSE SNAPPED THE QUEEN IT WAS A JACKAL AND THE DISPUTE WAXED SO WARM THAT THE KING SAID AT LAST VERY WELL
6925-80680-0003 WE'LL CALL THE GUARD AND ASK AND IF IT WAS A JACKAL I'LL LEAVE THIS KINGDOM TO YOU AND GO AWAY AND IF IT WAS A TIGER THEN YOU SHALL GO AND I WILL MARRY A NEW WIFE AS YOU LIKE ANSWERED THE QUEEN THERE ISN'T ANY DOUBT WHICH IT WAS
6925-80680-0004 SO THE KING CALLED THE TWO SOLDIERS WHO WERE ON GUARD OUTSIDE AND PUT THE QUESTION TO THEM BUT WHILST THE DISPUTE WAS GOING ON THE KING AND QUEEN HAD GOT SO EXCITED AND TALKED SO LOUD THAT THE GUARDS HAD HEARD NEARLY ALL THEY SAID AND ONE MAN OBSERVED TO THE OTHER
6925-80680-0005 MIND YOU DECLARE THAT THE KING IS RIGHT IT CERTAINLY WAS A JACKAL BUT IF WE SAY SO THE KING WILL PROBABLY NOT KEEP HIS WORD ABOUT GOING AWAY AND WE SHALL GET INTO TROUBLE SO WE HAD BETTER TAKE HIS SIDE TO THIS THE OTHER AGREED
6925-80680-0006 THE KING MADE NO REMARK BUT SENT FOR A PALANQUIN AND ORDERED THE QUEEN TO BE PLACED IN IT BIDDING THE FOUR BEARERS OF THE PALANQUIN TO TAKE HER A LONG WAY OFF INTO THE FOREST AND THERE LEAVE HER IN SPITE OF HER TEARS SHE WAS FORCED TO OBEY
6925-80680-0007 AND AWAY THE BEARERS WENT FOR THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS UNTIL THEY CAME TO A DENSE WOOD
6925-80680-0008 AND STARTED HOME AGAIN NOW THE QUEEN THOUGHT TO HERSELF THAT THE KING COULD NOT MEAN TO SEND HER AWAY FOR GOOD AND THAT AS SOON AS HE HAD GOT OVER HIS FIT OF TEMPER HE WOULD SUMMON HER BACK SO SHE STAYED QUITE STILL FOR A LONG TIME LISTENING WITH ALL HER EARS FOR APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS
6925-80680-0009 BUT HEARD NONE AFTER A WHILE SHE GREW NERVOUS FOR SHE WAS ALL ALONE AND PUT HER HEAD OUT OF THE PALANQUIN AND LOOKED ABOUT HER DAY WAS JUST BREAKING AND BIRDS AND INSECTS WERE BEGINNING TO STIR
6925-80680-0010 BUT ALTHOUGH THE QUEEN'S EYES WANDERED IN ALL DIRECTIONS THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY HUMAN BEING THEN HER SPIRIT GAVE WAY AND SHE BEGAN TO CRY IT SO HAPPENED THAT CLOSE TO THE SPOT WHERE THE QUEEN'S PALANQUIN HAD BEEN SET DOWN THERE DWELT A MAN WHO HAD A TINY FARM IN THE MIDST OF THE FOREST
6925-80680-0011 WHERE HE AND HIS WIFE LIVED ALONE FAR FROM ANY NEIGHBOURS AS IT WAS HOT WEATHER THE FARMER HAD BEEN SLEEPING ON THE FLAT ROOF OF HIS HOUSE BUT WAS AWAKENED BY THE SOUND OF WEEPING HE JUMPED UP AND RAN DOWNSTAIRS AS FAST AS HE COULD AND INTO THE FOREST TOWARDS THE PLACE THE SOUND CAME FROM
6925-80680-0012 AND WHEN SHE HAD TOLD HER STORY THE FARMER CALLED HIS WIFE WHO LED HER TO THEIR HOUSE AND GAVE HER FOOD TO EAT AND A BED TO LIE ON AND IN THE FARM A FEW DAYS LATER A LITTLE PRINCE WAS BORN AND BY HIS MOTHER'S WISH NAMED AMEER ALI
6925-80680-0013 YEARS PASSED WITHOUT A SIGN FROM THE KING HIS WIFE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR ALL HE SEEMED TO CARE THOUGH THE QUEEN STILL LIVED WITH THE FARMER AND THE LITTLE PRINCE HAD BY THIS TIME GROWN UP INTO A STRONG HANDSOME AND HEALTHY YOUTH OUT IN THE FOREST THEY SEEMED FAR FROM THE WORLD
6925-80680-0014 VERY FEW EVER CAME NEAR THEM AND THE PRINCE WAS CONTINUALLY BEGGING HIS MOTHER AND THE FARMER TO BE ALLOWED TO GO AWAY AND SEEK ADVENTURES AND TO MAKE HIS OWN LIVING BUT SHE AND THE WISE FARMER ALWAYS COUNSELLED HIM TO WAIT UNTIL
6925-80680-0015 AT LAST WHEN HE WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE THEY HAD NOT THE HEART TO FORBID HIM ANY LONGER
6925-80680-0016 A BIG BRASS POT TO HOLD WATER A FEW PIECES OF SILVER
6925-80680-0017 MANY A WEARY MILE HE TRAMPED DAY AFTER DAY UNTIL ONE MORNING HE SAW BEFORE HIM JUST SUCH A FOREST AS THAT IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN BORN AND BRED AND HE STEPPED JOYFULLY INTO IT LIKE ONE WHO GOES TO MEET AN OLD FRIEND
6925-80680-0018 PRESENTLY AS HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH A THICKET HE SAW A PIGEON WHICH HE THOUGHT WOULD MAKE A GOOD DINNER SO HE FIRED A PELLET AT IT FROM HIS GALAIL BUT MISSED THE PIGEON WHICH FLUTTERED AWAY WITH A STARTLED CLATTER AT THE SAME INSTANT HE HEARD A GREAT CLAMOUR FROM BEYOND THE THICKET
6925-80680-0019 AND ON REACHING THE SPOT HE FOUND AN UGLY OLD WOMAN STREAMING WET AND CRYING LOUDLY AS SHE LIFTED FROM HER HEAD
6925-80680-0020 THE OLD WOMAN'S FACE BRIGHTENED SHE SHOWED HIM WHERE TO SEEK THE WATER AND WHEN HE RETURNED A FEW MINUTES LATER WITH HIS POT FILLED TO THE BRIM SHE LED THE WAY WITHOUT A WORD AND HE FOLLOWED IN A SHORT WHILE THEY CAME TO A HUT IN THE FOREST
6925-80680-0021 AND AS THEY DREW NEAR IT AMEER ALI BEHELD IN THE DOORWAY THE LOVELIEST DAMSEL HIS EYES HAD EVER LOOKED ON AT THE SIGHT OF A STRANGER SHE DREW HER VEIL ABOUT HER AND STEPPED INTO THE HUT AND MUCH AS HE WISHED TO SEE HER AGAIN
6925-80680-0022 AMEER ALI COULD THINK OF NO EXCUSE BY WHICH TO BRING HER BACK AND SO WITH A HEAVY HEART HE MADE HIS SALUTATION AND BADE THE OLD WOMAN FAREWELL BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE A LITTLE WAY SHE CALLED AFTER HIM IF EVER YOU ARE IN TROUBLE OR DANGER
6925-80680-0023 COME TO WHERE YOU NOW STAND AND CRY FAIRY OF THE FOREST FAIRY OF THE FOREST HELP ME NOW AND I WILL LISTEN TO YOU THE PRINCE THANKED HER AND CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY BUT HE THOUGHT LITTLE OF THE OLD WOMAN'S SAYING AND MUCH OF THE LOVELY DAMSEL
6925-80680-0024 SHORTLY AFTERWARDS HE ARRIVED AT A CITY AND AS HE WAS NOW IN GREAT STRAITS
6925-80680-0025 THE KING SAID HE HAD PLENTY OF SERVANTS AND WANTED NO MORE
6925-80680-0026 AND PROMISED THAT HE SHOULD ENTER HIS BODYGUARD ON THE CONDITION THAT HE WOULD UNDERTAKE ANY SERVICE WHICH WAS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT OR DANGEROUS THIS WAS JUST WHAT AMEER ALI WANTED AND HE AGREED TO DO WHATEVER THE KING MIGHT WISH
6925-80680-0027 SOON AFTER THIS ON A DARK AND STORMY NIGHT WHEN THE RIVER ROARED BENEATH THE PALACE WALLS THE SOUND OF A WOMAN WEEPING AND WAILING WAS HEARD ABOVE THE STORM THE KING ORDERED A SERVANT TO GO AND SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER BUT THE SERVANT FALLING ON HIS KNEES IN TERROR
6925-80680-0028 BEGGED THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE SENT ON SUCH AN ERRAND PARTICULARLY ON A NIGHT SO WILD WHEN EVIL SPIRITS AND WITCHES WERE SURE TO BE ABROAD INDEED SO FRIGHTENED WAS HE THAT THE KING WHO WAS VERY KIND HEARTED BADE ANOTHER TO GO IN HIS STEAD
6925-80680-0029 BUT EACH ONE SHOWED THE SAME STRANGE FEAR THEN AMEER ALI STEPPED FORWARD THIS IS MY DUTY YOUR MAJESTY HE SAID I WILL GO THE KING NODDED AND OFF HE WENT THE NIGHT WAS AS DARK AS PITCH
6925-80680-0030 BUT HE MADE HIS WAY DOWN TO THE FORD UNDER THE PALACE WALLS AND STEPPED INTO THE FLOODED WATER INCH BY INCH AND FOOT BY FOOT HE FOUGHT HIS WAY ACROSS NOW NEARLY SWEPT OFF HIS FEET BY SOME SUDDEN SWIRL OR EDDY NOW NARROWLY ESCAPING
6925-80680-0031 BEING CAUGHT IN THE BRANCHES OF SOME FLOATING TREE THAT CAME TOSSING AND SWINGING DOWN THE STREAM AT LENGTH HE EMERGED PANTING AND DRIPPING WET ON THE OTHER SIDE CLOSE BY THE BANK STOOD A GALLOWS AND ON THE GALLOWS HUNG THE BODY OF SOME EVILDOER
6925-80680-0032 WHILST FROM THE FOOT OF IT CAME THE SOUND OF SOBBING THAT THE KING HAD HEARD
6925-80680-0033 OR OF THE ROARING RIVER AS FOR GHOSTS AND WITCHES THEY HAD NEVER TROUBLED HIM SO HE WALKED UP TOWARDS THE GALLOWS WHERE CROUCHED THE FIGURE OF THE WOMAN WHAT AILS YOU HE SAID NOW THE WOMAN WAS NOT REALLY A WOMAN AT ALL
6925-80680-0034 BUT A HORRID KIND OF WITCH WHO REALLY LIVED IN WITCHLAND AND HAD NO BUSINESS ON EARTH IF EVER A MAN STRAYED INTO WITCHLAND THE OGRESSES USED TO EAT HIM UP AND THIS OLD WITCH THOUGHT SHE WOULD LIKE TO CATCH A MAN FOR SUPPER
6925-80680-0035 IN HOPES THAT SOMEONE OUT OF PITY MIGHT COME TO HER RESCUE SO WHEN AMEER ALI QUESTIONED HER SHE REPLIED AH KIND SIR IT IS MY POOR SON WHO HANGS UPON THAT GALLOWS HELP ME TO GET HIM DOWN AND I WILL BLESS YOU FOR EVER
6925-80680-0036 AMEER ALI THOUGHT THAT HER VOICE SOUNDED RATHER EAGER
6925-80680-0037 AND BENT SO THAT THE OLD WOMAN COULD CLAMBER ON TO HIS BACK WHICH SHE DID VERY NIMBLY THEN SUDDENLY HE FELT A NOOSE SLIPPED OVER HIS NECK
6925-80680-0038 BUT AMEER ALI GAVE A SWEEP UPWARDS WITH HIS SHARP SWORD TO CUT THE ROPE THAT SHE HAD SLIPPED ROUND HIS NECK
6925-80680-0039 AND WITH A YELL OF PAIN AND ANGER SHE VANISHED INTO THE DARKNESS AMEER ALI THEN SAT DOWN TO COLLECT HIMSELF A LITTLE AND FELT UPON THE GROUND BY HIS SIDE AN ANKLET THAT HAD EVIDENTLY FALLEN OFF THE OLD WITCH'S FOOT
6925-80680-0040 AND AS THE STORM HAD BY THIS TIME PASSED OVER HE MADE HIS WAY BACK TO THE PALACE WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS STORY HE TOOK THE ANKLET OUT OF HIS POCKET AND HANDED IT TO THE KING WHO LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WAS AMAZED AT THE GLORY OF THE JEWELS WHICH COMPOSED IT INDEED
6925-80680-0041 AMEER ALI HIMSELF WAS ASTONISHED FOR HE HAD SLIPPED THE ANKLET INTO HIS POCKET IN THE DARK AND HAD NOT LOOKED AT IT SINCE THE KING WAS DELIGHTED AT ITS BEAUTY AND HAVING PRAISED AND REWARDED AMEER ALI HE GAVE THE ANKLET TO HIS DAUGHTER A PROUD AND SPOILED PRINCESS
6925-80680-0042 NOW IN THE WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE PALACE THERE HUNG TWO CAGES IN ONE OF WHICH WAS A PARROT AND IN THE OTHER A STARLING AND THESE TWO BIRDS COULD TALK AS WELL AS HUMAN BEINGS THEY WERE BOTH PETS OF THE PRINCESS WHO ALWAYS FED THEM HERSELF AND THE NEXT DAY AS SHE WAS
6925-80680-0043 WALKING GRANDLY ABOUT WITH HER TREASURE TIED ROUND HER ANKLE SHE HEARD THE STARLING SAY TO THE PARROT
6925-80680-0044 THAT WAS THE PARROT'S NAME HOW DO YOU THINK THE PRINCESS LOOKS IN HER NEW JEWEL THINK SNAPPED THE PARROT WHO WAS CROSS BECAUSE THEY HADN'T GIVEN HIM HIS BATH THAT MORNING I THINK SHE LOOKS LIKE A WASHERWOMAN'S DAUGHTER WITH ONE SHOE ON AND THE OTHER OFF
6925-80680-0045 WHY DOESN'T SHE WEAR TWO OF THEM INSTEAD OF GOING ABOUT WITH ONE LEG ADORNED AND THE OTHER EMPTY WHEN THE PRINCESS HEARD THIS SHE BURST INTO TEARS AND SENDING FOR HER FATHER
6925-80680-0046 OR SHE WOULD DIE OF SHAME SO THE KING SENT FOR AMEER ALI
6925-80680-0047 OR HE SHOULD BE HANGED FOR THE PRINCESS WOULD CERTAINLY DIE OF DISAPPOINTMENT POOR AMEER ALI WAS GREATLY TROUBLED AT THE KING'S COMMAND BUT HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF THAT HE HAD AT ANY RATE A MONTH IN WHICH TO LAY HIS PLANS HE LEFT THE PALACE AT ONCE
6925-80680-0048 AND INQUIRED OF EVERYONE WHERE THE FINEST JEWELS WERE TO BE GOT BUT THOUGH HE SOUGHT NIGHT AND DAY HE NEVER FOUND ONE TO COMPARE WITH THE ANKLET AT LAST ONLY A WEEK REMAINED AND HE WAS IN SORE DIFFICULTY WHEN HE REMEMBERED THE FAIRY OF THE FOREST
6925-80680-0049 THEREFORE AWAY HE WENT AND AFTER A DAY'S TRAVELLING HE REACHED THE COTTAGE IN THE FOREST AND STANDING WHERE HE HAD STOOD WHEN THE OLD WOMAN CALLED TO HIM HE CRIED FAIRY OF THE FOREST FAIRY OF THE FOREST HELP ME HELP ME
6925-80680-0050 THEN THERE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL HE HAD SEEN BEFORE WHOM IN ALL HIS WANDERINGS HE HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN WHAT IS THE MATTER SHE ASKED IN A VOICE SO SOFT THAT HE LISTENED LIKE ONE STRUCK DUMB
6925-80680-0051 THEN HE TOLD HER HIS STORY AND SHE WENT WITHIN THE COTTAGE AND CAME BACK WITH TWO WANDS AND A POT OF BOILING WATER THE TWO WANDS SHE PLANTED IN THE GROUND ABOUT SIX FEET APART AND THEN TURNING TO HIM SHE SAID
6925-80680-0052 AND HOLD IT OVER THE CAULDRON AND EVERY DROP OF BLOOD THAT FALLS FROM IT INTO THE WATER WILL BECOME A JEWEL NEXT YOU MUST CHANGE THE WANDS SO THAT THE ONE THAT STOOD AT MY HEAD IS AT MY FEET AND THE ONE AT MY FEET STANDS AT MY HEAD AND PLACE THE SEVERED FOOT AGAINST THE WOUND AND IT WILL HEAL
6925-80680-0053 AND I SHALL BECOME QUITE WELL AGAIN AS BEFORE AT FIRST
6925-80680-0054 AT LENGTH SHE PERSUADED HIM TO DO HER BIDDING HE NEARLY FAINTED HIMSELF WITH HORROR WHEN HE FOUND THAT AFTER THE CRUEL BLOW WHICH LOPPED HER FOOT OFF SHE LAY AS ONE LIFELESS BUT HE HELD THE SEVERED FOOT OVER THE CAULDRON AND AS DROPS OF BLOOD FELL FROM IT
6925-80680-0055 AND HE SAW EACH TURN IN THE WATER INTO SHINING GEMS HIS HEART TOOK COURAGE VERY SOON THERE WERE PLENTY OF JEWELS IN THE CAULDRON AND HE QUICKLY CHANGED THE WANDS PLACED THE SEVERED FOOT AGAINST THE WOUND AND IMMEDIATELY THE TWO PARTS BECAME ONE AS BEFORE
6925-80680-0056 THEN THE MAIDEN OPENED HER EYES SPRANG TO HER FEET AND DRAWING HER VEIL ABOUT HER RAN INTO THE HUT AND WOULD NOT COME OUT OR SPEAK TO HIM ANY MORE
6925-80680-0057 BUT THREE RARE AND BEAUTIFUL ANKLETS AND THESE HE DULY PRESENTED TO THE KING ON THE VERY DAY THAT HIS MONTH OF GRACE WAS OVER THE KING EMBRACED HIM WARMLY AND MADE HIM RICH GIFTS AND THE NEXT DAY THE VAIN PRINCESS PUT TWO ANKLETS ON EACH FOOT
6925-80680-0058 AND STRUTTED UP AND DOWN IN THEM ADMIRING HERSELF IN THE MIRRORS THAT LINED HER ROOM
6925-80680-0059 AND NEVER RECOVERED HIS TEMPER UNTIL AFTER LUNCH SHE'S GOT ALL HER BEAUTY AT ONE END OF HER NOW IF SHE HAD A FEW OF THOSE FINE GEW GAWS ROUND HER NECK AND WRISTS SHE WOULD LOOK BETTER BUT NOW TO MY MIND
6925-80680-0060 SHE LOOKS MORE THAN EVER LIKE THE WASHERWOMAN'S DAUGHTER DRESSED UP POOR PRINCESS SHE WEPT AND STORMED AND RAVED UNTIL SHE MADE HERSELF QUITE ILL
6925-80680-0061 AND THEN SHE DECLARED TO HER FATHER THAT UNLESS SHE HAD BRACELETS AND NECKLACE TO MATCH THE ANKLETS SHE WOULD DIE AGAIN THE KING SENT FOR AMEER ALI AND ORDERED HIM TO GET A NECKLACE AND BRACELETS TO MATCH THOSE ANKLETS WITHIN A MONTH OR BE PUT TO A CRUEL DEATH
6925-80680-0062 AND AGAIN AMEER ALI SPENT NEARLY THE WHOLE MONTH SEARCHING FOR THE JEWELS BUT ALL IN VAIN AT LENGTH HE MADE HIS WAY TO THE HUT IN THE FOREST AND STOOD AND CRIED FAIRY OF THE FOREST FAIRY OF THE FOREST HELP ME
6925-80680-0063 ONCE MORE THE BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN APPEARED AT HIS SUMMONS AND ASKED WHAT HE WANTED
6925-80680-0064 AND HER HEAD HER WORDS TURNED AMEER ALI PALE WITH HORROR BUT SHE REMINDED HIM THAT NO HARM HAD COME TO HER BEFORE AND AT LAST HE CONSENTED TO DO AS SHE BADE HIM
6925-80680-0065 FROM HER SEVERED HANDS AND HEAD THERE FELL INTO THE CAULDRON BRACELETS AND CHAINS OF RUBIES AND DIAMONDS
6925-80680-0066 THEN THE HEAD AND HANDS WERE JOINED ON TO THE BODY AND LEFT NEITHER SIGN NOR SCAR FULL OF GRATITUDE AMEER ALI TRIED TO SPEAK TO HER BUT SHE RAN INTO THE HOUSE AND WOULD NOT COME BACK AND HE WAS FORCED TO LEAVE HER
6925-80680-0067 WHEN ON THE DAY APPOINTED AMEER ALI PRODUCED A NECKLACE AND BRACELETS EACH MORE BEAUTIFUL AND PRICELESS THAN THE LAST THE KING'S ASTONISHMENT KNEW NO BOUNDS AND AS FOR HIS DAUGHTER SHE WAS NEARLY MAD WITH JOY
6925-80680-0068 THE VERY NEXT MORNING SHE PUT ON ALL HER FINERY AND THOUGHT THAT NOW AT LEAST THAT DISAGREEABLE PARROT COULD FIND NO FAULT WITH HER APPEARANCE AND SHE LISTENED EAGERLY WHEN SHE HEARD THE STARLING SAY
6925-80680-0069 HOW DO YOU THINK OUR PRINCESS IS LOOKING NOW VERY FINE NO DOUBT GRUMBLED THE PARROT BUT WHAT IS THE USE OF DRESSING UP LIKE THAT FOR ONESELF ONLY SHE OUGHT TO HAVE A HUSBAND WHY DOESN'T SHE MARRY THE MAN WHO GOT HER ALL THESE SPLENDID THINGS
6925-80680-0070 THEN THE PRINCESS SENT FOR HER FATHER AND TOLD HIM THAT SHE WISHED TO MARRY AMEER ALI
6925-80680-0071 SO THE KING SENT FOR AMEER ALI AND TOLD HIM THAT WITHIN A MONTH HE PROPOSED TO DO HIM THE HONOUR OF MARRYING HIM TO THE PRINCESS AND MAKING HIM HEIR TO THE THRONE ON HEARING THIS SPEECH
6925-80680-0072 AMEER ALI BOWED LOW AND ANSWERED THAT HE HAD DONE AND WOULD DO THE KING ALL THE SERVICE THAT LAY IN HIS POWER SAVE ONLY THIS ONE THING THE KING WHO CONSIDERED HIS DAUGHTER'S HAND A PRIZE FOR ANY MAN FLEW INTO A PASSION AND THE PRINCESS WAS MORE FURIOUS STILL
6925-80680-0073 AMEER ALI WAS INSTANTLY THROWN INTO THE MOST DISMAL PRISON THAT THEY COULD FIND AND ORDERED TO BE KEPT THERE UNTIL THE KING HAD TIME TO THINK IN WHAT WAY HE SHOULD BE PUT TO DEATH MEANWHILE THE KING DETERMINED THAT THE PRINCESS OUGHT IN ANY CASE TO BE MARRIED WITHOUT DELAY
6925-80680-0074 SO HE SENT FORTH HERALDS THROUGHOUT THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES PROCLAIMING THAT ON A CERTAIN DAY ANY PERSON FITTED FOR A BRIDEGROOM AND HEIR TO THE THRONE SHOULD PRESENT HIMSELF AT THE PALACE WHEN THE DAY CAME ALL THE COURT WERE GATHERED TOGETHER AND A GREAT CROWD ASSEMBLED OF MEN YOUNG AND OLD
6925-80680-0075 WHO THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD AS GOOD A CHANCE AS ANYONE ELSE TO GAIN BOTH THE THRONE AND THE PRINCESS AS SOON AS THE KING WAS SEATED HE CALLED UPON AN USHER TO SUMMON THE FIRST CLAIMANT BUT JUST THEN A FARMER WHO STOOD IN FRONT OF THE CROWD CRIED OUT THAT HE HAD A PETITION TO OFFER
6925-80680-0076 WELL HASTEN THEN SAID THE KING I HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE YOUR MAJESTY SAID THE FARMER HAS NOW LIVED AND ADMINISTERED JUSTICE LONG IN THIS CITY
6925-80680-0077 WHILST JACKALS HUNT IN EVERY PLACE WHERE THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE PICKED UP
6925-80680-0078 NO YOUR MAJESTY ANSWERED THE FARMER I WOULD ONLY REMIND YOUR MAJESTY THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF JACKALS GATHERED TO DAY TO TRY AND CLAIM YOUR DAUGHTER AND KINGDOM EVERY CITY HAS SENT THEM AND THEY WAIT HUNGRY AND EAGER BUT DO NOT O KING MISTAKE OR PRETEND AGAIN
6925-80680-0079 TO MISTAKE THE HOWL OF A JACKAL FOR THE HUNTING CRY OF A TIGER THE KING TURNED FIRST RED AND THEN PALE THERE IS CONTINUED THE FARMER A ROYAL TIGER BRED IN THE FOREST WHO HAS THE FIRST AND ONLY TRUE CLAIM TO YOUR THRONE WHERE
6925-80680-0080 GROWING PALE AS HE LISTENED IN PRISON REPLIED THE FARMER IF YOUR MAJESTY WILL CLEAR THIS COURT OF THE JACKALS I WILL EXPLAIN CLEAR THE COURT COMMANDED THE KING AND VERY UNWILLINGLY THE VISITORS LEFT THE PALACE NOW
6925-80680-0081 THEN THE FARMER TOLD THE KING AND HIS MINISTERS HOW HE HAD RESCUED THE QUEEN AND BROUGHT UP AMEER ALI AND HE FETCHED THE OLD QUEEN HERSELF WHOM HE HAD LEFT OUTSIDE AT THE SIGHT OF HER THE KING WAS FILLED WITH SHAME AND SELF REPROACH AND WISHED HE COULD HAVE LIVED HIS LIFE OVER AGAIN
6925-80680-0082 AND NOT HAVE MARRIED THE MOTHER OF THE PROUD PRINCESS WHO CAUSED HIM ENDLESS TROUBLE UNTIL HER DEATH MY DAY IS PAST SAID HE AND HE GAVE UP HIS CROWN TO HIS SON AMEER ALI WHO WENT ONCE MORE AND CALLED TO THE FOREST FAIRY TO PROVIDE HIM WITH A QUEEN TO SHARE HIS THRONE
6925-80680-0083 THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON I WILL MARRY SAID HE AND THIS TIME THE MAIDEN DID NOT RUN AWAY BUT AGREED TO BE HIS WIFE SO THE TWO WERE MARRIED WITHOUT DELAY AND LIVED LONG AND REIGNED HAPPILY AS FOR THE OLD WOMAN WHOSE PITCHER AMEER ALI HAD BROKEN
6925-80680-0084 SHE WAS THE FOREST MAIDEN'S FAIRY GODMOTHER AND WHEN SHE WAS NO LONGER NEEDED TO LOOK AFTER THE GIRL SHE GLADLY RETURNED TO FAIRYLAND THE OLD KING HAS NEVER BEEN HEARD TO CONTRADICT HIS WIFE ANY MORE IF HE EVEN LOOKS AS IF HE DOES NOT AGREE WITH HER
6925-80680-0085 SHE SMILES AT HIM AND SAYS IS IT THE TIGER THEN OR THE JACKAL

696-92939-0011 WHO WERE LATER TO SLAY HER BRUSSELS BECAME A PART OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE AND A TYRANNICAL GOVERNOR CAME THERE TO ESTABLISH HIS HEADQUARTERS ISSUING PROCLAMATIONS THREATENING THE BELGIANS WITH DEATH FOR MINOR OFFENSES AND FILLING BRUSSELS WITH SPIES AND INTRIGUE
696-92939-0012 MISS CAVELL DESIRED TO CONTINUE HER HOSPITAL WORK AND WENT TO THE GOVERNOR VON BISSING TO GET PERMISSION TO DO SO HE GRANTED IT FOR THE QUIET ENGLISH NURSE MADE AN IMPRESSION UPON HIM WE ARE TOLD THAT THE ARROGANT GERMAN FORMED A HIGH OPINION OF HER
696-92939-0013 SO MUCH SO THAT HE SECRETLY DETERMINED TO KEEP HER UNDER THE STRICTEST SUPERVISION FROM THAT TIME ON SPIES DOGGED HER TRACKS SHE CARED FOR THE WOUNDED GERMAN SOLDIERS AND NURSED A NUMBER OF GERMAN OFFICERS AS WELL AS THE BELGIANS WHO WERE IN HER CARE
696-92939-0014 BUT THIS MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THE AUTHORITIES THEY WERE DETERMINED TO DETECT HER IN SOME CRIME AND PUNISH HER IT WAS NOT FITTING THEY THOUGHT THAT AN ENEMY SHOULD BE ENGAGED IN WORKS OF MERCY EVEN THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES MIGHT BENEFIT THEREBY
696-92939-0015 AND SOON SPIES BEGAN TO COME TO THE GOVERNOR WITH TALES AND FABRICATIONS OF THE CRIMES THAT SHE HAD BEEN COMMITTING IN THEIR EYES THEY BORE WITNESS THAT SHE HAD GIVEN AN OVERCOAT TO A FRENCHMAN WHO WAS COLD AND HUNGRY AND THE FRENCHMAN LATER ESCAPED OVER THE DUTCH FRONTIER
696-92939-0016 ON THE NIGHT OF AUGUST FIFTH NINETEEN FIFTEEN WE ARE TOLD MISS CAVELL WAS TYING UP THE WOUNDS OF A WOUNDED GERMAN SOLDIER WHEN A GROUP OF ARMED MEN ENTERED THE ROOM AND THEIR LEADER TOLD HER ROUGHLY THAT SHE WAS UNDER ARREST
696-92939-0017 A BLOW WAS THE ONLY RESPONSE WHEN SHE TRIED TO EXPOSTULATE SHE WAS TAKEN TO PRISON AND PLACED IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT HER ARREST WAS SHROUDED WITH THE MOST CAREFUL SECRECY FOR THE GERMANS DID NOT WANT TO HAVE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF NEUTRAL GOVERNMENTS
696-92939-0018 SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES KNOW OF THE AFFAIR OR OF WHAT THEY PROPOSED TO DO BUT WORD OF HER PLIGHT DID REACH ENGLAND THROUGH A TRAVELER AND AT ONCE THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT REQUESTED THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR DOCTOR PAGE
696-92939-0019 TO GET WHAT INFORMATION HE COULD FROM BRAND WHITLOCK THE AMERICAN MINISTER IN BELGIUM HE WENT AT ONCE TO THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES BUT THEY EVADED HIS QUESTIONS AND WAITED TEN DAYS BEFORE GIVING HIM A REPLY THEN THE GERMANS SENT HIM A STATEMENT
696-92939-0020 AND FURNISHING THEM WITH GUIDES TO HELP THEM TO THE DUTCH FRONTIER WHENCE THEY MIGHT ESCAPE INTO HOLLAND AND RETURN TO ENGLAND THIS WAS THE GERMAN STATEMENT IF WHAT THEY SAID WERE TRUE THERE WAS STILL NO CAUSE FOR KILLING THE UNFORTUNATE WOMAN IN THEIR POWER
696-92939-0021 FOR SHE WAS NOT ACCUSED AT ANY TIME OF HAVING BEEN A SPY BUT THEY HAD PLANNED TO TRY HER FOR HER LIFE AND MISTER WHITLOCK SOON GUESSED THIS IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE GERMANS KEPT THEIR PREPARATIONS FROM HIM SO FAR AS POSSIBLE
696-92939-0022 AN AMERICAN LAWYER MISTER DE LEVAL WAS REQUESTED BY MISTER WHITLOCK TO TAKE MISS CAVELL'S CASE AND DO WHATEVER WAS POSSIBLE IN HER BEHALF HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO SEE THE PRISONER AND WAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO LOOK AT THE DOCUMENTS IN THE CASE UNTIL THE TRIAL BEGAN
696-92939-0023 ANOTHER LAWYER WHO WAS A BELGIAN SUDDENLY APPEARED AND TOLD THE AMERICANS THAT THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST CAUSE FOR THEM TO WORRY AS MISS CAVELL WAS SURE TO RECEIVE ONLY JUST TREATMENT HE ALSO PROMISED TO LET THEM KNOW WHEN THE TRIAL WAS TO TAKE PLACE
696-92939-0024 AND THAT HE WOULD KEEP THEM INFORMED OF ALL THE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CASE ALL THESE PROMISES WERE BROKEN IT IS TRUE THAT HE SENT A NOTE A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE TRIAL TELLING MISTER WHITLOCK THAT THE CASE WAS ABOUT TO COME TO COURT
696-92939-0025 HE NEVER INFORMED THEM THAT THE DEATH SENTENCE HAD BEEN IMPOSED HE NEVER CAME TO SEE THEM AFTERWARD AND WHEN THEY SOUGHT HIM FOR AN EXPLANATION AND FOR ASSISTANCE HE HAD DISAPPEARED MISS CAVELL WAS KEPT IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR TWO MONTHS
696-92939-0026 WAS CALM DIGNIFIED AND BRAVE AT THE TRIAL AND FACED HER ACCUSERS HEROICALLY SHE WAS DRESSED IN HER NURSE'S UNIFORM AND WORE THE BADGE OF THE RED CROSS WHEN MISTER WHITLOCK LEARNED THAT SHE HAD BEEN TRIED AND SENTENCED TO DEATH
696-92939-0027 HE DID EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO SECURE HER PARDON OR AT LEAST A MODERATION OF THE PUNISHMENT HE WROTE TO BARON VON DER LANCKEN POINTING OUT IN A CLEAR AND DECISIVE MANNER THAT MISS CAVELL HAD SERVED THE GERMANS BY CARING FOR THEIR WOUNDED
696-92939-0028 AND THAT THE DEATH SENTENCE HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN INFLICTED FOR THE CRIME OF WHICH SHE WAS ACCUSED HE ALSO WROTE A NOTE TO THE BARON WHICH IS AS FOLLOWS MY DEAR BARON I AM TOO ILL TO PRESENT MY REQUEST TO YOU IN PERSON
696-92939-0029 BUT I APPEAL TO YOUR GENEROSITY OF HEART TO SUPPORT IT AND SAVE THIS UNFORTUNATE WOMAN FROM DEATH HAVE PITY ON HER BRAND WHITLOCK
696-92939-0030 ALL THROUGH THE DAY THE AMERICAN LEGATION SENT MESSAGE AFTER MESSAGE TO THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES ASKING FOR INFORMATION THEY RECEIVED NONE AT SIX TWENTY IN THE EVENING THEY WERE TOLD BY A SUBORDINATE THAT THE SENTENCE HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN
696-92939-0031 ONLY TO LEARN LATER THAT IT HAD INDEED BEEN DECLARED AND THAT MISS CAVELL WOULD FACE A FIRING SQUAD AT TWO O'CLOCK THE FOLLOWING MORNING MISTER WHITLOCK THEN URGED BARON VON DER LANCKEN
696-92939-0032 TO MITIGATE THE SENTENCE AND AT ELEVEN IN THE EVENING HE WAS TOLD THAT VON BISSING REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING TO SAVE MISS CAVELL'S LIFE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE GOVERNOR DENIED THIS APPEAL EDITH CAVELL WAS ALLOWED TO SEE A BRITISH CHAPLAIN SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST AFRAID OF DEATH
696-92939-0033 AND WILLINGLY GAVE HER LIFE FOR HER COUNTRY HER WORDS RESEMBLED THOSE OF FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE THAT HAVE BEEN QUOTED ELSEWHERE IN THIS BOOK DEATH SHE SAID WAS WELL KNOWN TO HER AND SHE HAD SEEN IT SO OFTEN THAT IT WAS NOT STRANGE OR FEARFUL TO HER
696-92939-0034 EARLY IN THE MORNING WITH HER EYES BANDAGED MISS CAVELL WAS LED OUT TO FACE THE RIFLES OF THE HUNS SHE WORE AN ENGLISH FLAG OVER HER BOSOM ONLY GERMANS WERE WITNESSES OF THE EXECUTION BUT THE GERMAN CHAPLAIN WHO ATTENDED SAID THAT SHE DIED LIKE A HEROINE
696-92939-0035 WHEN HER DEATH BECAME KNOWN THE ENTIRE CIVILIZED WORLD WAS SHOCKED AND HORRIFIED IN ENGLAND THIS MURDER DID MORE TO STIMULATE RECRUITING THAN ANYTHING ELSE UP TO THAT TIME ALL DAY LONG LINES OF MEN WAITED TO SIGN THE PAPERS OF ENLISTMENT
696-92939-0036 AND IN MISS CAVELL'S HOME TOWN EVERY ELIGIBLE MAN WAS SWORN INTO THE ARMY A BITTER DENUNCIATION OF THE GERMAN ACT WAS MADE BY SIR EDWARD GREY THE GERMANS THEMSELVES HAD ONLY A POOR EXCUSE FOR WHAT THEY HAD DONE
696-92939-0037 IN BRIEF THE CASE AGAINST THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES IS AS FOLLOWS THEY HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY INFLICTED THE DEATH PENALTY FOR THE OFFENSE OF WHICH MISS CAVELL WAS ACCUSED THEY HAD KEPT HER IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AND PREVENTED HER FROM CONSULTING AN ADVOCATE UP TO THE TIME OF HER TRIAL
696-92939-0038 SHE WAS TRIED WITH GREAT HASTE AND WITH GREAT SECRECY AND AFTER THE TRIAL THE SENTENCE WAS CARRIED OUT FAR MORE SPEEDILY THAN USUAL MOREOVER THEY HAD DECEIVED MISTER WHITLOCK AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN LEGATION AND HAD DONE SO DELIBERATELY
696-92939-0039 AFTER THE EXECUTION THEY REFUSED TO RETURN THE BODY BUT THE NAME OF EDITH CAVELL HAS BECOME ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT NAMES AND HER FAME GROWS BRIGHTER AS TIME PASSES
696-93314-0000 THE TWO WERE ALONE IN THE GRASSY COURTYARD OF THE RUINED CASTLE THE REST OF THE PICNIC PARTY HAD WANDERED AWAY FROM THEM OR THEY FROM IT OUT OF THE GREEN GROWN MOUND OF FALLEN MASONRY BY THE CORNER OF THE CHAPEL A GREAT MAY BUSH GREW
696-93314-0001 SILVERED AND PEARLED ON EVERY SCENTED STILL SPRAY THE SKY WAS DEEP CLEAR STRONG BLUE ABOVE AND AGAINST THE BLUE THE WALLFLOWERS SHONE BRAVELY FROM THE CRACKS AND CREVICES OF RUINED ARCH AND WALL AND BUTTRESS
696-93314-0002 THEY SHINE LIKE GOLD SHE SAID
696-93314-0003 DO YOU WANT SOME HE SAID AND ON THE INSTANT HIS HAND HAD FOUND A STRONG JUTTING STONE HIS FOOT A FIRM LEDGE AND SHE SAW HIS FIGURE GREY FLANNEL AGAINST GREY STONE GO UP THE WALL TOWARDS THE YELLOW FLOWERS
696-93314-0004 OH DON'T SHE CRIED I DON'T REALLY WANT THEM PLEASE NOT I WISH THEN SHE STOPPED BECAUSE HE WAS ALREADY SOME TWELVE FEET FROM THE GROUND AND SHE KNEW THAT ONE SHOULD NOT SPEAK TO A MAN WHO IS CLIMBING RUINED WALLS
696-93314-0005 HAD LOVED HIM THESE TWO YEARS HAD LOVED HIM SINCE THE DAY OF THEIR FIRST MEETING AND THAT WAS JUST AS LONG AS HE HAD LOVED HER BUT HE HAD NEVER TOLD HIS LOVE THERE IS A CODE OF HONOUR RIGHT OR WRONG
696-93314-0006 AND IT FORBIDS A MAN WITH AN INCOME OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY A YEAR TO SPEAK OF LOVE TO A GIRL WHO IS RECKONED AN HEIRESS THERE ARE PLENTY WHO TRANSGRESS THE CODE BUT THEY ARE IN ALL THE OTHER STORIES
696-93314-0007 HE DROVE HIS PASSION ON THE CURB AND MASTERED IT YET THE QUESTIONS DOES SHE LOVE ME DOES SHE KNOW I LOVE HER DOES SHE WONDER WHY I DON'T SPEAK AND THE COUNTER QUESTIONS WILL SHE THINK I DON'T CARE
696-93314-0008 WHEN WE LET OUR EMOTIONS PLAY THE PRIMITIVE GAMES WITH US BUT ALWAYS THE MORNING BROUGHT STRENGTH TO KEEP TO HIS RESOLUTION HE SAW HER THREE TIMES A YEAR WHEN CHRISTMAS EASTER AND MIDSUMMER BROUGHT HER TO STAY WITH AN AUNT BROUGHT HIM HOME TO HIS PEOPLE FOR HOLIDAYS
696-93314-0009 AND THOUGH HE HAD DENIED HIMSELF THE JOY OF SPEAKING IN WORDS HE HAD LET HIS EYES SPEAK MORE THAN HE KNEW AND NOW HE HAD REACHED THE WALLFLOWERS HIGH UP AND WAS PLUCKING THEM AND THROWING THEM DOWN SO THAT THEY FELL IN A WAVERING BRIGHT SHOWER ROUND HER FEET
696-93314-0010 THERE WAS NO SOUND AT ALL BUT THE GRATING OF HIS FEET AS HE SET THEM ON THE STONES AND THE MOVEMENT NOW AND THEN OF A BIRD IN THE IVY THEN CAME A RUSTLE A GRITTY CLATTER LOUD FALLING STONES HIS FOOT HAD SLIPPED AND HE HAD FALLEN
696-93314-0011 NO HE WAS HANGING BY HIS HANDS ABOVE THE GREAT REFECTORY ARCH AND HIS BODY SWUNG HEAVILY WITH THE IMPETUS OF THE CHECKED FALL HE WAS MOVING ALONG NOW SLOWLY HANGING BY HIS HANDS NOW HE GRASPED AN IVY ROOT ANOTHER
696-93314-0012 AND PULLED HIMSELF UP TILL HIS KNEE WAS ON THE MOULDING OF THE ARCH SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED ANYONE WHO HAD TOLD HER THAT ONLY TWO MINUTES HAD BEEN LIVED BETWEEN THE MOMENT OF HIS STUMBLE AND THE OTHER MOMENT WHEN HIS FOOT TOUCHED THE GRASS
696-93314-0013 CAUGHT HIM BY THE ARMS JUST ABOVE THE ELBOW SHOOK HIM ANGRILY AS ONE SHAKES A NAUGHTY CHILD LOOKED HIM ONCE IN THE EYES AND BURIED HER FACE IN HIS NECK SOBBING LONG DRY BREATHLESS SOBS EVEN THEN HE TRIED TO BE STRONG
696-93314-0014 DON'T HE SAID TENDERLY DON'T WORRY IT'S ALL RIGHT I WAS A FOOL PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER THERE'S SOMEONE COMING I DON'T CARE SHE SAID
696-93314-0015 FOR THE TOUCH OF HIS CHEEK PRESSED AGAINST HER HAIR TOLD HER ALL THAT SHE WANTED TO KNOW LET THEM COME I DON'T CARE OH HOW COULD YOU BE SO SILLY AND HORRID
696-93314-0016 OH HOW COULD YOU OF COURSE A REALLY HONOURABLE YOUNG MAN
696-93314-0017 HE DIDN'T HE ACCEPTED IT WITH HIS ARMS ROUND HER AND HIS LIPS AGAINST THE FACE WHERE THE TEARS NOW RAN WARM AND SALT IT WAS ONE OF THE IMMORTAL MOMENTS THE PICTURE WAS CHARMING TOO
696-93314-0018 A PICTURE TO WRING THE HEART OF THE ONLOOKER WITH ENVY OR SYMPATHY ACCORDING TO HIS NATURE BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE ONLOOKER A MAN OF FORTY OR THEREABOUTS WHO PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT UNDER THE GREAT GATE OF THE CASTLE AND TOOK IN THE FULL CHARM AND MEANING OF THE SCENE
696-93314-0019 HE TURNED AWAY AND WENT BACK ALONG THE GREEN PATH WITH HELL IN HIS HEART THE OTHER TWO WERE IN PARADISE THE ONLOOKER FELL LIKE THE THIRD IN EDEN THE SERPENT IN FACT TWO MILES AWAY HE STOPPED AND LIT A PIPE
696-93314-0020 IT'S GOT TO BE BORNE I SUPPOSE HE SAID LIKE ALL THE REST OF IT SHE'S HAPPY ENOUGH I OUGHT TO BE GLAD ANYWAY I CAN'T STOP IT PERHAPS HE SWORE A LITTLE
696-93314-0021 IF HE DID THE LESS PRECISE AND DEVOTIONAL MAY PARDON HIM HE HAD LOVED THE GIRL SINCE HER EARLY TEENS AND IT WAS ONLY YESTERDAY'S POST THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM THE APPOINTMENT THAT ONE MIGHT MARRY ON THE APPOINTMENT HAD COME THROUGH HER FATHER
696-93314-0022 THE LOVER WHO CAME TO HIS LOVE OVER STREWN WALLFLOWERS DESIRED ALWAYS AS HAS BEEN SEEN TO ACT UP TO HIS MORAL IDEAS SO HE TOOK NEXT DAY A MUCH EARLIER TRAIN THAN WAS AT ALL PLEASANT
696-93314-0023 AND CALLED ON HER FATHER TO EXPLAIN HIS POSITION AND SET FORTH HIS PROSPECTS HIS COMING WAS HERALDED BY A LETTER FROM HER ONE MUST NOT QUOTE IT IT IS NOT PROPER TO READ OTHER PEOPLE'S LETTERS ESPECIALLY LETTERS TO A TRUSTED FATHER FROM A CHILD ONLY AND ADORED
696-93314-0024 ITS EFFECT MAY BE INDICATED BRIEFLY IT SHOWED THE FATHER THAT THE GIRL'S HAPPINESS HAD HAD TWO LONG YEARS IN WHICH TO LEARN TO GROW ROUND THE THOUGHT OF THE YOUNG MAN WHOM HE NOW FACED FOR THE FIRST TIME ODD
696-93314-0025 FOR TO THE FATHER HE SEEMED JUST LIKE OTHER YOUNG MEN IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THERE WERE SO MANY MORE OF THE SAME PATTERN FROM WHOM SHE MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN AND MANY OF THEM WELL OFF TOO HOWEVER THE LETTER LAY IN THE PROSPEROUS POCKET BOOK IN THE BREAST OF THE FATHER'S FROCK COAT
696-93314-0026 AND THE LOVER WAS RECEIVED AS THOUGH THAT LETTER WERE A CHARM TO ENSURE SUCCESS A FAULTY OR AT LEAST A SLOW WORKING CHARM HOWEVER FOR THE FATHER DID NOT LIFT A BAG OF GOLD FROM HIS SAFE AND SAY TAKE HER TAKE THIS ALSO BE HAPPY
696-93314-0027 HE ONLY CONSENTED TO A PROVISIONAL ENGAGEMENT TOOK AN EARNEST INTEREST IN THE YOUNG MAN'S AFFAIRS AND OFFERED TO MAKE HIS DAUGHTER AN ANNUAL ALLOWANCE ON HER MARRIAGE AT MY DEATH SHE WILL HAVE MORE HE SAID
696-93314-0028 THE YOUNG MAN MADE A REVERENT NOTE OF THE NAME AND THE INTERVIEW SEEMED PLAYED OUT IT'S A COMPLICATED NUISANCE THE FATHER MUSED IT ISN'T EVEN AS IF I KNEW ANYTHING OF THE CHAP I OUGHTN'T TO HAVE ALLOWED THE CHILD TO MAKE THESE LONG VISITS TO HER AUNT
696-93314-0029 BUT AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS TOOTHACHE ALL THE SAME HE HAD ANOTHER CALLER THAT AFTERNOON HE WHOM WE KNOW AS THE ONLOOKER CAME TO THANK HIM FOR THE INFLUENCE THAT HAD GOT HIM THE APPOINTMENT AS DOCTOR TO THE INFLUENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY THE FATHER OPENED HIS HEART TO THE ONLOOKER
696-93314-0030 BUT I DON'T SEE HOW TO DEVELOP THE ACTION IT REALLY IS RATHER AMUSING THAT I I SHOULD HAVE TO TAP HIS BEASTLY CHEST AND LISTEN TO HIS CURSED LUNGS AND ASK SYMPATHETIC QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS IDIOTIC INFANT ILLNESSES
696-93314-0031 ONE THING HE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO REMEMBER THOSE PRETTY VIVIDLY THE CONFOUNDED PUP THE ONLOOKER HAD NEVER DONE ANYTHING WRONGER THAN YOU HAVE DONE MY GOOD READER AND HE NEVER EXPECTED TO MEET A GIANT TEMPTATION ANY MORE THAN YOU DO
696-93314-0032 WHAT DID HE DIE OF FOR THE ANSWER WAS HEART AND IN IT THE DEVIL ROSE AND SHOWED THE ONLOOKER THE REALLY ONLY TRUE AND ARTISTIC WAY TO DEVELOP THE ACTION IN THIS SITUATION SO DRAMATIC IN ITS POSSIBILITIES
696-93314-0033 THE ILLUMINATIVE FLASH OF TEMPTATION WAS SO SUDDEN SO BRILLIANT THAT THE DOCTOR ONLOOKER CLOSED HIS SOUL'S EYES AND YIELDED WITHOUT EVEN THE LEAST PRETENCE OF RESISTANCE HE TOOK HIS STETHOSCOPE FROM THE TABLE
696-93314-0034 HE WALKED WITH MORE THAN HIS ORDINARY FIRMNESS OF GAIT AS A MAN DOES WHO IS JUST DRUNK ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT HE MUST TRY TO LOOK SOBER HE WALKED DOWN THE STREET CERTAIN WORDS RINGING IN HIS EARS HEART AFFECTED PROBABLY HEREDITARY WEAKNESS
696-93314-0035 NO OFFICE IN THE WORLD WOULD INSURE YOU AND SO IT WAS ALL OVER THE DREAMS THE HOPES THE PALPITATING FAITH IN A BEAUTIFUL FUTURE HIS DAYS MIGHT BE LONG THEY MIGHT BE BRIEF BUT BE HIS LIFE LONG OR SHORT HE MUST LIVE IT ALONE
696-93314-0036 HE HAD A LITTLE FIGHT WITH HIMSELF AS HE WENT DOWN WIMPOLE STREET THEN HE HAILED A HANSOM AND WENT AND TOLD HER FATHER WHO QUITE AGREED WITH HIM THAT IT WAS ALL OVER THE FATHER WONDERED AT HIMSELF FOR BEING MORE SORRY THAN GLAD
696-93314-0037 SHE SAID WHY YOU WANT ME MORE THAN EVER BUT I MAY DIE AT ANY MOMENT SO MAY I AND YOU MAY LIVE TO BE A HUNDRED I'LL TAKE MY CHANCE
696-93314-0038 OH DON'T YOU SEE TOO THAT IF THERE IS ONLY A LITTLE TIME WE OUGHT TO SPEND IT TOGETHER IT'S IMPOSSIBLE HE SAID IT'S NO GOOD I MUST SET MY TEETH AND BEAR IT AND YOU I HOPE IT WON'T BE AS HARD FOR YOU AS IT WILL FOR ME
696-93314-0039 BUT YOU CAN'T GIVE ME UP IF I WON'T BE GIVEN UP CAN YOU HIS SMILE STRUCK HER DUMB IT WAS MORE CONVINCING THAN HIS WORDS
696-93314-0040 YOU'LL FORGIVE ME WON'T YOU I DIDN'T KNOW AND OH WHAT'S THE USE OF TALKING YET THEY TALKED FOR HOURS CONVENTIONALLY HE SHOULD HAVE TORN HIMSELF AWAY UNABLE TO BEAR THE STRAIN OF HIS AGONY
696-93314-0041 AS A MATTER OF FACT HE SAT BY HER HOLDING HER HAND IT WAS FOR THE LAST TIME THE LAST LAST TIME THERE WAS REALLY A THIRD AT THAT INTERVIEW THE ONLOOKER HAD IMAGINATION ENOUGH TO SEE THE SCENE BETWEEN THE PARTING LOVERS
696-93314-0042 THEY PARTED AND NOW THE ONLOOKER DARED NOT MEET HER DARED NOT CALL AT THE HOUSE AS HE HAD USED TO DO AT LAST THE FATHER PRESSED HIM HE WENT HE MET HER AND IT WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD MET THE GHOST OF HER WHOM HE HAD LOVED
696-93314-0043 HER EYES HAD BLUE MARKS UNDER THEM HER CHIN HAD GROWN MORE POINTED HER NOSE SHARPER THERE WAS A NEW LINE ON HER FOREHEAD AND HER EYES HAD CHANGED OVER THE WINE HE HEARD FROM THE FATHER THAT SHE WAS PINING FOR THE LOVER WHO HAD INHERITED HEART DISEASE
696-93314-0044 I SUPPOSE IT WAS YOU WHO SAW HIM BY THE WAY SAID HE A TALL WELL SET UP YOUNG FELLOW DARK NOT BAD LOOKING I I DON'T REMEMBER LIED THE ONLOOKER
696-93314-0045 WITH THE EYES OF HIS MEMORY ON THE WHITE FACE OF THE MAN HE HAD STABBED NOW THE LOVER AND THE ONLOOKER HAD EACH HIS OWN BURDEN TO BEAR AND THE LOVER'S WAS THE EASIER HE WORKED STILL THOUGH THERE WAS NOW NOTHING TO WORK FOR MORE
696-93314-0046 HE WORKED AS HE HAD NEVER WORKED IN HIS LIFE BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT IF HE DID NOT TAKE TO WORK HE SHOULD TAKE TO DRINK OR WORSE DEVILS AND HE SET HIS TEETH AND SWORE THAT HER LOVER SHOULD NOT BE DEGRADED HE KNEW THAT SHE LOVED HIM AND THERE WAS A KIND OF FIERCE PAIN PLEASURE
696-93314-0047 LIKE THAT OF SCRATCHING A SORE IN THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS AS WRETCHED AS HE WAS THAT DIVIDED IN ALL ELSE THEY WERE YET UNITED IN THEIR SUFFERING HE THOUGHT IT MADE HIM MORE MISERABLE TO KNOW OF HER MISERY BUT IT DIDN'T HE NEVER SAW HER BUT HE DREAMED OF HER
696-93314-0048 AND SOMETIMES THE DREAMS GOT OUT OF HAND AND CARRIED HIM A THOUSAND WORLDS FROM ALL THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM THEN HE HAD TO WAKE UP AND THAT WAS BAD BUT THE ONLOOKER WAS NO DREAMER AND HE SAW HER ABOUT THREE TIMES A WEEK
696-93314-0049 COVERING A CLEAR CUT MASK OF SET ENDURANCE AND THERE WAS NO WORK THAT COULD SHUT OUT THAT SIGHT NO TEMPTATION OF THE WORLD THE FLESH OR THE DEVIL TO GIVE HIM EVEN THE RELIEF OF A FIGHT HE HAD NO TEMPTATIONS HE HAD NEVER HAD BUT THE ONE
696-93314-0050 HIS SOUL WAS NAKED TO THE BITTER WIND OF THE ACTUAL AND THE DAYS WENT BY WENT BY AND EVERY DAY HE KNEW MORE AND MORE SURELY THAT HE HAD LIED AND THROWN AWAY HIS SOUL AND THAT THE WAGES OF SIN WERE DEATH AND NO OTHER THING WHATEVER
696-93314-0051 AND GRADUALLY LITTLE BY LITTLE THE WHOLE WORTH OF LIFE SEEMED TO LIE IN THE FAINT FAR CHANCE OF HIS BEING ABLE TO UNDO THE ONE TRIUMPHANTLY IMPULSIVE AND UNREASONING ACTION OF HIS LIFE
696-93314-0052 BUT THERE ARE SOME ACTS THAT THERE IS NO UNDOING AND THE HELL THAT HAD BURNED IN HIS HEART SO FIERCELY WHEN HE HAD SEEN HER IN THE OTHER MAN'S ARMS BURNED NOW WITH NEW BRIGHT LIGHTS AND INFERNAL FLICKERING FLAME TONGUES AND AT LAST OUT OF HELL
696-93314-0053 THE ONLOOKER REACHED OUT HIS HANDS AND CAUGHT AT PRAYER HE CAUGHT AT IT AS A DROWNING MAN CATCHES AT A WHITE GLEAM IN THE BLACK OF THE SURGING SEA ABOUT HIM IT MAY BE A PAINTED SPAR IT MAY BE EMPTY FOAM THE ONLOOKER PRAYED
696-93314-0054 YES SPEAKING PROFESSIONALLY I THINK YOU ARE WRONG YOU LESSEN YOUR CHANCES OF LIFE WHY DON'T YOU TRY A COMPLETE CHANGE BECAUSE IF YOU MUST KNOW MY CHANCES OF LIFE HAVE CEASED TO INTEREST ME
696-93314-0055 THE LOVER WAS SHORT WITH THE ONLOOKER BUT HE PERSISTED WELL IF ONE ISN'T INTERESTED IN ONE'S LIFE ONE MAY BE INTERESTED IN ONE'S DEATH OR THE MANNER OF IT IN YOUR PLACE I SHOULD ENLIST
696-93314-0056 IT'S BETTER TO DIE OF A BULLET IN SOUTH AFRICA THAN OF FRIGHT IN LONDON THAT ROUSED THE LOVER AS IT WAS MEANT TO DO I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT BUSINESS IT IS OF YOURS SIR HE SAID
696-93314-0057 BUT IT'S YOUR BUSINESS TO KNOW THAT THEY WOULDN'T PASS A MAN WITH A HEART LIKE MINE I DON'T KNOW THEY'RE NOT SO PARTICULAR JUST NOW THEY WANT MEN I SHOULD TRY IT IF I WERE YOU IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COMPLETE CHANGE YOU'LL GO ALL TO PIECES
696-93314-0058 THAT'S ALL THE ONLOOKER GOT OUT AT THE NEXT STATION SHORT OF OWNING TO HIS OWN LIE HE HAD DONE WHAT HE COULD TO INSURE ITS BEING FOUND OUT FOR THE LIE IT WAS OR AT LEAST FOR A MISTAKE
696-93314-0059 AND WHEN HE HAD DONE WHAT HE COULD HE SAW THAT THE LOVER MIGHT NOT FIND IT OUT MIGHT BE PASSED FOR THE ARMY MIGHT GO TO THE FRONT MIGHT BE KILLED AND THEN WELL I'VE DONE MY BEST ANYHOW HE SAID TO HIMSELF
696-93314-0060 AND HIMSELF ANSWERED HIM LIAR YOU HAVE NOT DONE YOUR BEST YOU WILL HAVE TO EAT YOUR LIE YES THOUGH IT WILL SMASH YOUR LIFE AND RUIN YOU SOCIALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY YOU WILL HAVE TO TELL HIM YOU LIED AND TELL HIM WHY
696-93314-0061 YOU WILL NEVER LET HIM GO TO SOUTH AFRICA WITHOUT TELLING HIM THE TRUTH AND YOU KNOW IT WELL YOU KNOW BEST I SUPPOSE HE SAID TO HIMSELF BUT ARE YOU PERFECTLY CERTAIN
696-93314-0062 YE'LL MAK A FINE SOLDIER MY LAD I THINK NOT SAID THE LOVER AND HE WENT OUT FROM THE PRESENCE THIS TIME HE REELED LIKE A MAN TOO DRUNK TO CARE HOW DRUNK HE LOOKS HE DROVE IN CABS FROM HARLEY STREET TO WIMPOLE STREET
696-93314-0063 WHEN HE HAD TOLD THE GIRL EVERYTHING AND WHEN SHE WAS ABLE TO DO ANYTHING BUT LAUGH AND CRY AND CLING TO HIM WITH THIN HANDS SHE SAID DEAR I DO SO HATE TO THINK BADLY OF ANYONE BUT DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT MAN WAS MISTAKEN
696-93314-0064 HE'S VERY VERY CLEVER MY CHILD
696-93314-0065 DON'T MEAN THAT I KNOW YOU'RE ALL RIGHT THANK GOD OH THANK GOD I MEAN DON'T YOU THINK HE MAY HAVE LIED TO YOU TO PREVENT YOUR MARRYING ME
696-93314-0066 WHY SHOULD HE HE ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM THREE WEEKS AGO HE'S A VERY OLD FRIEND OF OURS I DO HATE TO BE SUSPICIOUS BUT IT IS ODD AND THEN HIS TRYING TO GET YOU TO SOUTH AFRICA
696-93314-0067 I'M CERTAIN HE WANTED YOU OUT OF THE WAY HE WANTED YOU TO GET KILLED OH HOW CAN PEOPLE BE SO CRUEL
7059-77897-0000 OH NO I DON'T CARE ANYTHING ABOUT HIM SAID MISSUS MUNGER TOUCHING HER PONY WITH THE TIP OF HER WHIP LASH HE'S AN ODIOUS LITTLE CREATURE AND I KNEW THAT HE WOULD GO FOR THE DANCE AND SUPPER BECAUSE MISTER PECK WAS OPPOSED TO THEM HE'S ONE OF THE ANTI PECK PARTY IN HIS CHURCH
7059-77897-0001 AND THAT IS THE REASON I SPOKE TO HIM BUT I MEANT THE OTHER GENTLEMEN YOU SAW HOW THEY TOOK IT I SAW THAT THEY BOTH MADE FUN OF IT SAID ANNIE YES THAT'S JUST THE POINT
7059-77897-0002 IT THROWS A NEW LIGHT ON IT AND IF THAT'S THE WAY NICE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT IT WHY WE MUST GIVE UP THE IDEA I'M QUITE PREPARED TO DO SO BUT I WANT TO SEE MISSUS WILMINGTON FIRST MISSUS MUNGER SAID ANNIE UNEASILY
7059-77897-0003 I WOULD RATHER NOT SEE MISSUS WILMINGTON WITH YOU ON THIS SUBJECT I SHOULD BE OF NO USE
7059-77897-0004 AND SHE LAID HER ARM ACROSS ANNIE'S LAP AS IF TO PREVENT HER JUMPING OUT OF THE PHAETON AS MISSUS WILMINGTON'S OLD FRIEND YOU WILL HAVE THE GREATEST INFLUENCE WITH HER BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I WISH TO INFLUENCE HER IN FAVOUR OF THE SUPPER AND DANCE I DON'T KNOW THAT I BELIEVE IN THEM SAID ANNIE
7059-77897-0005 COWED AND TROUBLED BY THE AFFAIR THAT DOESN'T MAKE THE SLIGHTEST DIFFERENCE SAID MISSUS MUNGER IMPARTIALLY ALL YOU WILL HAVE TO DO IS TO KEEP STILL I WILL PUT THE CASE TO HER SHE CHECKED THE PONY BEFORE THE BAR WHICH THE FLAGMAN AT THE RAILROAD CROSSING HAD LET DOWN
7059-77897-0006 WHILE A LONG FREIGHT TRAIN CLATTERED DEAFENINGLY BY AND THEN DROVE BUMPING AND JOUNCING ACROSS THE TRACKS I SUPPOSE YOU REMEMBER WHAT OVER THE TRACK MEANS IN HATBORO OH YES SAID ANNIE WITH A SMILE SOCIAL PERDITION AT THE LEAST

7059-77897-0008 BETWEEN THE HIGH WINDOWY BULKS OF THE SHOE SHOPS AND HAT SHOPS THE DUST GRADUALLY FREED ITSELF FROM THE CINDERS ABOUT THE TRACKS AND IT HARDENED INTO A HANDSOME NEWLY MADE ROAD BEYOND THE HOUSES OF THE SHOP HANDS
7059-77897-0009 THE LAWN BEFORE IT SLOPED DOWN TO THE ROAD WHERE IT ENDED SMOOTHLY AT THE BRINK OF A NEAT STONE WALL A BLACK ASPHALT PATH CURVED FROM THE STEPS BY WHICH YOU MOUNTED FROM THE STREET TO THE STEPS BY WHICH YOU MOUNTED TO THE HEAVY PORTICO
7059-77897-0010 BEFORE THE MASSIVE BLACK WALNUT DOORS THE LADIES WERE SHOWN INTO THE MUSIC ROOM FROM WHICH THE NOTES OF A PIANO WERE SOUNDING WHEN THEY RANG AND MISSUS WILMINGTON ROSE FROM THE INSTRUMENT TO MEET THEM A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD BEEN STANDING BESIDE HER TURNED AWAY

7059-77897-0032 SAID MISSUS WILMINGTON CARELESSLY
7059-77900-0000 MISS NORTHWICK CALLED UPON ANNIE DURING THE WEEK WITH EXCUSES FOR HER DELAY AND FOR COMING ALONE SHE SEEMED TO HAVE INTENTIONS OF BEING POLITE BUT SHE CONSTANTLY BETRAYED HER WANT OF INTEREST IN ANNIE AND DISAPPOINTED AN EXPECTATION OF REFINEMENT
7059-77900-0001 WHICH HER PHYSICAL DELICACY AWAKENED SHE ASKED HER HOW SHE EVER CAME TO TAKE UP THE SOCIAL UNION AND ANSWERED FOR HER THAT OF COURSE IT HAD THE ATTRACTION OF THE THEATRICALS AND WENT ON TO TALK OF HER SISTER'S PART IN THEM
7059-77900-0002 THE RELATION OF THE NORTHWICK FAMILY TO THE COMING ENTERTAINMENT AND AN IMPRESSION OF FRAIL MOTTLED WRISTS AND HIGH THIN CHEEKS AND AN ABSENCE OF MODELLING UNDER AFFLUENT DRAPERY WAS THE MAIN EFFECT OF MISS NORTHWICK'S VISIT WHEN ANNIE RETURNED IT
7059-77900-0003 SHE MET THE YOUNGER SISTER WHOM SHE FOUND A GREAT BEAUTY SHE SEEMED VERY COLD AND OF A HAUTEUR WHICH SHE SUBDUED WITH DIFFICULTY BUT SHE WAS MORE CONSECUTIVELY POLITE THAN HER SISTER AND ANNIE WATCHED WITH FASCINATION HER TURNS OF THE HEAD
7059-77900-0004 HER MOVEMENTS OF LEOPARD SWIFTNESS AND ELASTICITY THE CHANGING LIGHTS OF HER COMPLEXION THE CURVES OF HER FINE LIPS THE FLUTTERING OF HER THIN NOSTRILS A VERY NEW BASKET PHAETON STOOD GLITTERING AT ANNIE'S DOOR WHEN SHE GOT HOME
7059-77900-0005 AND MISSUS WILMINGTON PUT HER HEAD OUT OF THE OPEN PARLOUR WINDOW HOW D'YE DO ANNIE SHE DRAWLED IN HER TENDER VOICE WON'T YOU COME IN YOU SEE I'M IN POSSESSION

7059-77900-0012 WE'LL JUST GO ROUND THERE AND KILL TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE I OUGHT TO SHOW OFF MY NEW PHAETON TO MISTER WILMINGTON FIRST OF ALL HE GAVE IT TO ME IT WOULD BE KIND OF CONJUGAL OR FILIAL OR SOMETHING
7059-77900-0013 YOU KNOW MISTER WILMINGTON AND I ARE NOT EXACTLY CONTEMPORARIES ANNIE I HEARD HE WAS SOMEWHAT YOUR SENIOR SAID ANNIE RELUCTANTLY LYRA LAUGHED
7059-77900-0014 THEY CAME ROUND INTO THE REGION OF THE SHOPS AND LYRA CHECKED HER PONY IN FRONT OF HER HUSBAND'S FACTORY IT WAS NOT IMPOSINGLY LARGE BUT AS MISSUS WILMINGTON CAUSED ANNIE TO OBSERVE IT WAS AS BIG AS THE HAT SHOPS AND AS UGLY AS THE SHOE SHOPS
7059-77900-0015 THE STRUCTURE TREMBLED WITH THE OPERATION OF ITS INDUSTRY AND AS THEY MOUNTED THE WOODEN STEPS TO THE OPEN OUTSIDE DOOR AN INNER DOOR SWUNG AJAR FOR A MOMENT AND LET OUT A ROAR MINGLED OF THE HUM AND WHIRL
7059-77900-0016 AND FINDING ITS FIRST APARTMENT EMPTY
7059-77900-0017 WHERE HER HUSBAND SAT WRITING AT A TABLE GEORGE I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO MISS KILBURN
7059-77900-0018 WITH THE HABIT HE HAD OF TOUCHING IT THERE WITH THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE MADE ANNIE THINK OF A CAT THAT HAD BEEN AT THE CREAM I'VE BEEN HOPING TO CALL WITH MISSUS WILMINGTON TO PAY MY RESPECTS BUT I'VE BEEN AWAY A GREAT DEAL THIS SEASON AND AND
7059-77900-0019 WE'RE ALL VERY HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HOME AGAIN MISS KILBURN I'VE OFTEN HEARD MY WIFE SPEAK OF YOUR OLD DAYS TOGETHER AT HATBORO THEY FENCED WITH SOME POLITE FEINTS OF INTEREST IN EACH OTHER THE OLD MAN STANDING BESIDE HIS WRITING TABLE
7059-77900-0020 AND STAYING HIMSELF WITH A SHAKING HAND UPON IT LYRA INTERRUPTED THEM WELL I THINK NOW THAT ANNIE IS HERE WE'D BETTER NOT LET HER GET AWAY WITHOUT SHOWING HER THE WORKS OH OH DECIDEDLY
7059-77900-0021 I'LL GO WITH YOU WITH GREAT PLEASURE AH HE BUSTLED ABOUT PUTTING THE THINGS TOGETHER ON HIS TABLE AND THEN REACHING FOR THE PANAMA HAT ON A HOOK BEHIND IT THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN HIS EAGERNESS TO DO WHAT LYRA BADE HIM
7059-77900-0022 I'LL SHOW THEM THROUGH HE SAID TO HIS UNCLE AND THE OLD MAN ASSENTED WITH WELL PERHAPS YOU'D BETTER JACK AND WENT BACK TO HIS ROOM THE WILMINGTON STOCKING MILLS SPUN THEIR OWN THREADS
7059-77900-0023 AND THE FIRST ROOM WAS LIKE WHAT ANNIE HAD SEEN BEFORE IN COTTON FACTORIES WITH A FAINT SMELL OF OIL FROM THE MACHINERY AND A FINE SNOW OF FLUFF IN THE AIR AND CATCHING TO THE WHITE WASHED WALLS AND THE FOUL WINDOW SASHES
7059-77900-0024 THE TIRELESS MACHINES MARCHED BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE FLOOR AND THE MEN WHO WATCHED THEM WITH SUICIDAL INTENSITY RAN AFTER THEM BAREFOOTED WHEN THEY MADE OFF WITH A BROKEN THREAD SPLICED IT AND THEN ESCAPED FROM THEM TO THEIR STATIONS AGAIN
7059-77900-0025 THEY LOOKED AFTER LYRA AND HER NEPHEW FROM UNDER COTTON FROWSED BANGS THEY ALL SEEMED TO KNOW HER AND RETURNED HER EASY KINDLY GREETINGS WITH AN EFFECT OF LIKING
7059-77900-0026 FROM TIME TO TIME AT LYRA'S BIDDING THE YOUNG FELLOW EXPLAINED TO ANNIE SOME CURIOUS FEATURE OF THE PROCESSES
7059-77900-0027 EXCEPT WHEN JACK WILMINGTON CURTLY ORDERED THEM TO DO THIS OR THAT IN ILLUSTRATION OF SOME POINT HE WAS EXPLAINING SHE WEARIED HERSELF AS PEOPLE DO IN SUCH PLACES IN EXPRESSING HER WONDER AT THE INGENUITY OF THE MACHINERY
7059-77900-0028 IT WAS A RELIEF TO GET AWAY FROM IT ALL INTO THE ROOM COOL AND QUIET WHERE HALF A DOZEN NEAT GIRLS WERE COUNTING AND STAMPING THE STOCKINGS WITH DIFFERENT NUMBERS HERE'S WHERE I USED TO WORK SAID LYRA
7059-77900-0029 AND HERE'S WHERE I FIRST MET MISTER WILMINGTON THE PLACE IS FULL OF ROMANTIC ASSOCIATIONS THE STOCKINGS ARE ALL ONE SIZE ANNIE
7059-77900-0030 I DON'T WELL THEY'RE NOT DREAMS EXACTLY ANNIE WHEN ALL'S SAID AND DONE FOR THEM WHEN THEY LEFT THE MILL SHE ASKED ANNIE TO COME HOME TO TEA WITH HER SAYING
7059-77900-0031 AS IF FROM A PERCEPTION OF HER DISLIKE FOR THE YOUNG FELLOW THAT JACK WAS GOING TO BOSTON THEY HAD A LONG EVENING TOGETHER AFTER MISTER WILMINGTON TOOK HIMSELF OFF AFTER TEA TO HIS STUDY AS HE CALLED IT
7059-77900-0032 AND REMAINED SHUT IN THERE ANNIE WAS UNEASILY AWARE OF HIM FROM TIME TO TIME BUT LYRA HAD APPARENTLY NO MORE DISTURBANCE FROM HIS ABSENCE THAN FROM HIS PRESENCE WHICH SHE HAD MANAGED WITH A FRANK ACCEPTANCE OF EVERYTHING IT SUGGESTED
7059-77900-0033 SHE TALKED FREELY OF HER MARRIAGE NOT AS IF IT WERE LIKE OTHERS BUT FOR WHAT IT WAS SHE SHOWED ANNIE OVER THE HOUSE AND SHE ENDED WITH A DISPLAY OF THE RICH DRESSES WHICH HE WAS ALWAYS BUYING HER AND WHICH SHE NEVER WORE BECAUSE SHE NEVER WENT ANYWHERE
7059-77900-0034 ANNIE SAID SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD AT LEAST LIKE TO GO TO THE SEASIDE SOMEWHERE DURING THE SUMMER BUT NO LYRA SAID IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH TROUBLE AND YOU KNOW ANNIE I ALWAYS DID HATE TROUBLE
7059-77900-0035 AND I DON'T WANT TO BE POKED INTO A HOTEL SO I STAY IN HATBORO SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN A VILLAGE GIRL AND DID NOT MISS THE INTERESTS OF A LARGER LIFE AS SHE CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF THEM IN SOUTH HATBORO OR WANT THE BOTHER OF THEM
7059-77900-0036 SHE SAID SHE STUDIED MUSIC A LITTLE AND CONFESSED THAT SHE READ A GOOD DEAL NOVELS MOSTLY THOUGH THE LIBRARY WAS HANDSOMELY EQUIPPED WITH WELL BOUND GENERAL LITERATURE AT MOMENTS IT ALL SEEMED NO HARM
7059-77900-0037 AT OTHERS THE LUXURY IN WHICH THIS LIFE WAS SO CONTENTEDLY SUNK OPPRESSED ANNIE LIKE A THICK CLOSE AIR YET SHE KNEW THAT LYRA WAS KIND TO MANY OF THE POOR PEOPLE ABOUT HER AND DID A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD AS THE PHRASE IS
7059-77900-0038 WITH THE SUPERFLUITY WHICH IT INVOLVED NO SELF DENIAL TO GIVE FROM BUT MISTER PECK HAD GIVEN HER A POINT OF VIEW AND THOUGH SHE BELIEVED SHE DID NOT AGREE WITH HIM SHE COULD NOT ESCAPE FROM IT
7059-77900-0039 OUGHT TO BE TACIT OR EXPLICIT IN THE KISSING AND EMBRACING BETWEEN ROMEO AND JULIET
7059-77900-0040 OH THEN SAID ANNIE PERHAPS HE ACCOUNTS FOR HER PLAYING JULIET
7059-77900-0041 OH IT'S AT THE REHEARSALS YOU KNOW THAT THE FUN IS
7059-77900-0042 ANNIE LAY AWAKE A LONG TIME THAT NIGHT SHE WAS SURE THAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO LIKE LYRA IF SHE DID NOT APPROVE OF HER AND THAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE GONE HOME TO TEA WITH HER AND SPENT THE EVENING WITH HER UNLESS SHE FULLY RESPECTED HER
7059-88364-0000 AROUND LOS ANGELES THE GREATEST AND MOST CHARACTERISTIC MOVING PICTURE COLONIES ARE BEING BUILT EACH PHOTOPLAY MAGAZINE HAS ITS CALIFORNIA LETTER TELLING OF THE PUTTING UP OF NEW STUDIOS AND THE TRANSFER OF ACTORS
7059-88364-0001 WITH MUCH SLAP YOU ON THE BACK PERSONAL GOSSIP THIS IS THE OUTGROWTH OF THE FACT THAT EVERY TYPE OF THE PHOTOPLAY BUT THE INTIMATE IS FOUNDED ON SOME PHASE OF THE OUT OF DOORS BEING THUS DEPENDENT
7059-88364-0002 THE PLANT CAN BEST BE SET UP WHERE THERE IS NO WINTER BESIDES THIS THE LOS ANGELES REGION HAS THE SEA THE MOUNTAINS THE DESERT AND MANY KINDS OF GROVE AND FIELD LANDSCAPE AND ARCHITECTURE ARE SUB TROPICAL
7059-88364-0003 BUT FOR A DESCRIPTION OF CALIFORNIA ASK ANY TRAVELLER OR STUDY THE BACKGROUND OF ALMOST ANY PHOTOPLAY IF THE PHOTOPLAY IS THE CONSISTENT UTTERANCE OF ITS SCENES IF THE ACTORS ARE INCARNATIONS OF THE LAND THEY WALK UPON
7059-88364-0004 AS THEY SHOULD BE CALIFORNIA INDEED STANDS A CHANCE TO ACHIEVE THROUGH THE FILMS AN UTTERANCE OF HER OWN WILL THIS LAND FURTHEST WEST BE THE FIRST TO CAPTURE THE INNER SPIRIT OF THIS NEWEST AND MOST CURIOUS OF THE ARTS
7059-88364-0005 ALREADY THE CALIFORNIA SORT IN THE COMMERCIAL CHANNELS HAS BECOME THE BROADLY ACCEPTED IF MEDIOCRE NATIONAL FORM PEOPLE WHO REVERE THE PILGRIM FATHERS OF SIXTEEN TWENTY
7059-88364-0006 HAVE OFTEN WISHED THOSE GENTLEMEN HAD MOORED THEIR BARK IN THE REGION OF LOS ANGELES RATHER THAN PLYMOUTH ROCK THAT BOSTON HAD BEEN FOUNDED THERE AT LAST THAT LANDING IS ACHIEVED
7059-88364-0007 PATRIOTIC ART STUDENTS HAVE DISCUSSED WITH MINGLED IRONY AND ADMIRATION THE BOSTON DOMINATION OF THE ONLY AMERICAN CULTURE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY NAMELY LITERATURE INDIANAPOLIS HAS HAD HER DAY SINCE THEN
7059-88364-0008 CHICAGO IS LIFTING HER HEAD NEVERTHELESS BOSTON STILL CONTROLS THE TEXT BOOK IN ENGLISH AND DOMINATES OUR HIGH SCHOOLS IRONIC FEELINGS IN THIS MATTER ON THE PART OF WESTERN MEN ARE BASED SOMEWHAT ON ENVY AND ILLEGITIMATE CUSSEDNESS
7059-88364-0009 BUT ARE ALSO GROUNDED IN THE HONEST HOPE OF A HEALTHFUL RIVALRY THEY WANT NEW ROMANTICISTS AND ARTISTS AS INDIGENOUS TO THEIR SOIL AS WAS HAWTHORNE TO WITCH HAUNTED SALEM OR LONGFELLOW TO THE CHESTNUTS OF HIS NATIVE HEATH
7059-88364-0010 WHATEVER MAY BE SAID OF THE PATRIARCHS FROM OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES TO AMOS BRONSON ALCOTT THEY WERE TRUE SONS OF THE NEW ENGLAND STONE FENCES AND MEETING HOUSES THEY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BORN OR NURTURED ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH
7059-88364-0011 SOME OF US VIEW WITH A PECULIAR THRILL THE PROSPECT THAT LOS ANGELES MAY BECOME THE BOSTON OF THE PHOTOPLAY PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BETTER TO SAY THE FLORENCE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA REMINDS ONE
7059-88364-0012 YET THERE IS A DIFFERENCE THE PRESENT DAY MAN IN THE STREET MAN ABOUT TOWN CALIFORNIAN HAS AN OBVIOUS MAGNIFICENCE ABOUT HIM THAT IS ALLIED TO THE EUCALYPTUS TREE THE POMEGRANATE CALIFORNIA IS A GILDED STATE
7059-88364-0013 IT HAS NOT THE SORDIDNESS OF GOLD AS HAS WALL STREET BUT IT IS THE EMBODIMENT OF THE NATURAL ORE THAT THE RAGGED PROSPECTOR FINDS THE GOLD OF CALIFORNIA IS THE COLOR OF THE ORANGE THE GLITTER OF DAWN IN THE YOSEMITE
7059-88364-0014 THE HUE OF THE GOLDEN GATE THAT OPENS THE SUNSET WAY TO MYSTIC AND TERRIBLE CATHAY AND HINDUSTAN THE ENEMY OF CALIFORNIA SAYS THE STATE IS MAGNIFICENT BUT THIN
7059-88364-0015 HE DECLARES IT IS AS THOUGH IT WERE PAINTED ON A BROBDINGNAGIAN PIECE OF GILT PAPER AND HE WHO DAMPENS HIS FINGER AND THRUSTS IT THROUGH FINDS AN ALKALI VALLEY ON THE OTHER SIDE THE LONELY PRICKLY PEAR AND A HEAP OF ASHES FROM A DESERTED CAMP FIRE
7059-88364-0016 HE SAYS THE CITIZENS OF THIS STATE LACK THE RICHNESS OF AN AESTHETIC AND RELIGIOUS TRADITION HE SAYS THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR TIME BUT EVEN THESE THINGS MAKE FOR COINCIDENCE
7059-88364-0017 AS THE SHADOW IT THROWS UPON THE SCREEN THIS NEWNESS CALIFORNIA HAS IN COMMON WITH ALL PHOTOPLAYS IT IS THRILLINGLY POSSIBLE FOR THE STATE AND THE ART TO ACQUIRE SPIRITUAL TRADITION AND DEPTH TOGETHER
7059-88364-0018 PART OF THE THINNESS OF CALIFORNIA IS NOT ONLY ITS YOUTH BUT THE RESULT OF THE PHYSICAL FACT THAT THE HUMAN RACE IS THERE SPREAD OVER SO MANY ACRES OF LAND THEY TRY NOT ONLY TO COUNT THEIR MINES AND ENUMERATE THEIR PALM TREES
7059-88364-0019 BUT THEY COUNT THE MILES OF THEIR SEA COAST AND THE ACRES UNDER CULTIVATION AND THE HEIGHT OF THE PEAKS AND REVEL IN LARGE STATISTICS AND THE BIGNESS GENERALLY AND FORGET HOW A FEW MEN RATTLE AROUND IN A GREAT DEAL OF SCENERY
7059-88364-0020 THEY SHOUT THEIR STATISTICS ACROSS THE ROCKIES AND THE DESERTS TO NEW YORK THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY IS NON EXISTENT TO THE CALIFORNIAN HIS FELLOW FEELING IS FOR THE OPPOSITE COAST LINE
7059-88364-0021 THROUGH THE GEOGRAPHICAL ACCIDENT OF SEPARATION BY MOUNTAIN AND DESERT FROM THE REST OF THE COUNTRY HE BECOMES A MERE SHOUTER HURRAHING SO ASSIDUOUSLY THAT ALL VARIETY IN THE VOICE IS LOST
7059-88364-0022 THEY WILL BE A DIFFERENT SET OF VIRTUES FROM THOSE OF NEW ENGLAND THERE IS NO MORE NATURAL PLACE FOR THE SCATTERING OF CONFETTI THAN THIS STATE EXCEPT THE MOVING PICTURE SCENE ITSELF BOTH HAVE A GENIUS FOR GARDENS AND DANCING AND CARNIVAL
7059-88364-0023 WHEN THE CALIFORNIAN RELEGATES THE DRAMATIC TO SECONDARY SCENES BOTH IN HIS LIFE AND HIS PHOTOPLAY AND TURNS TO THE GENUINELY EPIC AND LYRIC
7059-88364-0024 HE AND THIS INSTRUMENT MAY FIND THEIR IMMORTALITY TOGETHER AS NEW ENGLAND FOUND ITS SOUL IN THE ESSAYS OF EMERSON
7059-88364-0025 THROUGH ALL FOUR SEASONS FAIRY BEAUTY OVERWHELMS THE LUMBERING GRAND STAND PLAYERS THE TINIEST GARDEN IS A JEWELLED PATHWAY OF WONDER BUT THE CALIFORNIAN CANNOT SHOUT
7059-88364-0026 ORANGE BLOSSOMS ORANGE BLOSSOMS HELIOTROPE HELIOTROPE HE CANNOT BOOM FORTH ROSELEAVES ROSELEAVES SO THAT HE DOES THEIR BEAUTIES JUSTICE
7059-88364-0027 HERE IS WHERE THE PHOTOPLAY CAN BEGIN TO GIVE HIM A MORE DELICATE UTTERANCE AND HE CAN GO ON INTO STRANGER THINGS AND EVOLVE ALL THE SPLENDOR FILMS INTO HIGHER TYPES FOR THE VERY NAME OF CALIFORNIA IS SPLENDOR
7059-88364-0028 THE CALIFORNIA PHOTO PLAYWRIGHT CAN BASE HIS CROWD PICTURE UPON THE CITY WORSHIPPING MOBS OF SAN FRANCISCO HE CAN DERIVE HIS PATRIOTIC AND RELIGIOUS SPLENDORS FROM SOMETHING OLDER AND MORE MAGNIFICENT
7059-88364-0029 THAN THE AISLES OF THE ROMANESQUE NAMELY THE GROVES OF THE GIANT REDWOODS THE CAMPAIGN FOR A BEAUTIFUL NATION COULD VERY WELL EMANATE FROM THE WEST COAST WHERE WITH THE SLIGHTEST CARE
7059-88364-0030 GROW UP MODELS FOR ALL THE WORLD OF PLANT ARRANGEMENT AND TREE LUXURY OUR MECHANICAL EAST IS REPROVED OUR TENSION IS RELAXED OUR UGLINESS IS CHALLENGED EVERY TIME WE LOOK UPON THOSE GARDEN PATHS AND FORESTS
7059-88364-0031 IT IS POSSIBLE FOR LOS ANGELES TO LAY HOLD OF THE MOTION PICTURE AS OUR NATIONAL TEXT BOOK IN ART AS BOSTON APPROPRIATED TO HERSELF THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE NATIONAL TEXT BOOKS OF LITERATURE
7059-88364-0032 IF CALIFORNIA HAS A SHINING SOUL AND NOT MERELY A GOLDEN BODY LET HER FORGET HER SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD MELODRAMATICS AND TURN TO HER POETS WHO UNDERSTAND THE HEART UNDERNEATH THE GLORY EDWIN MARKHAM
7059-88364-0033 THE DEAN OF AMERICAN SINGERS CLARK ASHTON SMITH THE YOUNG STAR TREADER GEORGE STERLING THAT SON OF ANCIENT MERLIN HAVE IN THEIR SONGS THE SEEDS OF BETTER SCENARIOS THAN CALIFORNIA HAS SENT US
7059-88364-0034 THERE ARE TWO POEMS BY GEORGE STERLING THAT I HAVE HAD IN MIND FOR MANY A DAY AS CONCEPTIONS THAT SHOULD INSPIRE MYSTIC FILMS AKIN TO THEM THESE POEMS ARE THE NIGHT SENTRIES AND
7067-76047-0000 AFTER TWENTY FOUR EVENTFUL HOURS OUR TWO STUDENTS OF HUMAN MOTIVES FOUND THEMSELVES TOGETHER AGAIN BY THE FIREPLACE IN THE OLD GEORGE SMOKING ROOM THEY HAD RESUMED THEIR OVERNIGHT CONVERSATION IN A STATE OF CONSIDERABLE TENSION
7067-76047-0001 A BROAD AND ORIGINAL THINKER AS YOU ARE THOUGHT IS ONE MATTER RASH INCONSIDERATE ACTION QUITE ANOTHER AND ABOVE ALL IF I SPEND ANOTHER DAY IN OR NEAR THE COMPANY OF MISS
7067-76047-0002 AND BIT HIS LOWER LIP AND CONSIDERED WE MIGHT DROP BELINDA HE SUGGESTED TURNING TO HIS FRIEND AND SPEAKING IN LOW CONFIDENTIAL TONES SHE IS QUITE A MANAGEABLE PERSON QUITE
7067-76047-0003 SHE COULD FOR EXAMPLE BE LEFT BEHIND WITH THE LUGGAGE AND SENT ON BY TRAIN I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU REALIZE HOW THE LAND LIES IN THAT QUARTER IT NEEDS ONLY A WORD TO MISS GRAMMONT THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE REPLY
7067-76047-0004 FOR A MOMENT HE HAD A WILD HOPE THAT HIS COMPANION WOULD AGREE AND THEN HE PERCEIVED THAT THE DOCTOR'S SILENCE MEANT ONLY THE PREPARATION OF AN ULTIMATUM I OBJECT TO MISS GRAMMONT AND THAT SIDE OF THE THING MORE THAN I DO TO MISS SEYFFERT
7067-76047-0005 SIR RICHMOND SAID NOTHING IT MAY HELP YOU TO SEE THIS AFFAIR FROM A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ANGLE IF I TELL YOU THAT TWICE TODAY MISS SEYFFERT HAS ASKED ME IF YOU WERE A MARRIED MAN AND OF COURSE YOU TOLD HER I WAS
7067-76047-0006 ON THE SECOND OCCASION SIR RICHMOND SMILED AGAIN FRANKLY SAID THE DOCTOR THIS ADVENTURE IS ALTOGETHER UNCONGENIAL TO ME IT IS THE SORT OF THING THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED IN MY LIFE THIS HIGHWAY COUPLING
7067-76047-0007 DON'T YOU THINK SAID SIR RICHMOND THAT YOU ARE ATTACHING RATHER TOO MUCH WHAT SHALL I SAY ROMANTIC FLIRTATIOUS MEANING TO THIS AFFAIR
7067-76047-0008 BUT ISN'T YOUR ATTITUDE RATHER UNFAIR UNJUST INDEED AND ALMOST INSULTING TO THIS MISS GRAMMONT AFTER ALL SHE'S A YOUNG LADY OF VERY GOOD SOCIAL POSITION INDEED
7067-76047-0009 SHE DOESN'T STRIKE YOU DOES SHE AS AN UNDIGNIFIED OR HELPLESS HUMAN BEING HER MANNERS SUGGEST A PERSON OF CONSIDERABLE SELF CONTROL AND KNOWING LESS OF ME THAN YOU DO SHE PROBABLY REGARDS ME AS ALMOST AS SAFE AS A MAIDEN AUNT SAY
7067-76047-0010 I'M TWICE HER AGE WE ARE A PARTY OF FOUR THERE ARE CONVENTIONS THERE ARE CONSIDERATIONS AREN'T YOU REALLY MY DEAR MARTINEAU OVERDOING ALL THIS SIDE OF THIS VERY PLEASANT LITTLE ENLARGEMENT OF OUR INTERESTS
7067-76047-0011 AM I SAID DOCTOR MARTINEAU AND BROUGHT A SCRUTINIZING EYE TO BEAR ON SIR RICHMOND'S FACE I WANT TO GO ON TALKING TO MISS GRAMMONT FOR A DAY OR SO SIR RICHMOND ADMITTED THEN I SHALL PREFER TO LEAVE YOUR PARTY
7067-76047-0012 THERE WERE SOME MOMENTS OF SILENCE I AM REALLY VERY SORRY TO FIND MYSELF IN THIS DILEMMA SAID SIR RICHMOND WITH A NOTE OF GENUINE REGRET IN HIS VOICE IT IS NOT A DILEMMA SAID DOCTOR MARTINEAU WITH A CORRESPONDING LOSS OF ASPERITY
7067-76047-0013 I GRANT YOU WE DISCOVER WE DIFFER UPON A QUESTION OF TASTE AND CONVENIENCE BUT BEFORE I SUGGESTED THIS TRIP I HAD INTENDED TO SPEND A LITTLE TIME WITH MY OLD FRIEND SIR KENELM LATTER AT BOURNEMOUTH NOTHING SIMPLER THAN TO GO TO HIM NOW
7067-76047-0014 I SHALL BE SORRY ALL THE SAME I COULD HAVE WISHED SAID THE DOCTOR THAT THESE LADIES HAD HAPPENED A LITTLE LATER THE MATTER WAS SETTLED NOTHING MORE OF A PRACTICAL NATURE REMAINED TO BE SAID
7067-76047-0015 BUT NEITHER GENTLEMAN WISHED TO BREAK OFF WITH A HARSH AND BARE DECISION WHEN THE NEW AGE IS HERE SAID SIR RICHMOND THEN SURELY A FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN WILL NOT BE SUBJECTED TO THE THE INCONVENIENCES YOUR PRESENT CODE WOULD SET ABOUT IT
7067-76047-0016 AND HONOUR THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN BEFORE IN MATTERS OF PROPERTY ECONOMICS AND PUBLIC CONDUCT IT WILL PROBABLY BE JUST THE REVERSE THEN THERE WILL BE MUCH MORE COLLECTIVE CONTROL AND MUCH MORE INSISTENCE LEGAL INSISTENCE UPON INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY
7067-76047-0017 BUT WE ARE NOT LIVING IN A NEW AGE YET WE ARE LIVING IN THE PATCHED UP RUINS OF A VERY OLD ONE AND YOU IF YOU WILL FORGIVE ME ARE LIVING IN THE PATCHED UP REMAINS OF A LIFE THAT HAD ALREADY HAD ITS COMPLICATIONS
7067-76047-0018 THIS YOUNG LADY WHOSE CHARM AND CLEVERNESS I ADMIT BEHAVES AS IF THE NEW AGE WERE ALREADY HERE WELL THAT MAY BE A VERY DANGEROUS MISTAKE BOTH FOR HER AND FOR YOU THIS AFFAIR IF IT GOES ON FOR A FEW DAYS MORE
7067-76047-0019 MAY INVOLVE VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES INDEED WITH WHICH I FOR ONE DO NOT WISH TO BE INVOLVED SIR RICHMOND UPON THE HEARTHRUG HAD A CURIOUS FEELING THAT HE WAS BACK IN THE HEAD MASTER'S STUDY AT CAXTON
7067-76047-0020 AND IN MANY WAYS INTERESTING I HAVE BEEN WATCHING HER I HAVE NOT BEEN FAVOURED WITH VERY MUCH OF HER ATTENTION BUT THAT FACT HAS ENABLED ME TO SEE HER IN PROFILE
7067-76047-0021 MISS SEYFFERT IS A FAIRLY CRUDE MIXTURE OF FRANKNESS INSINCERITY AND SELF EXPLANATORY EGOTISM AND I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DISREGARD A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF THE CONVERSATION SHE HAS ADDRESSED TO ME
7067-76047-0022 NOW I GUESS THIS MISS GRAMMONT HAS HAD NO MOTHER SINCE SHE WAS QUITE LITTLE YOUR GUESSES DOCTOR ARE APT TO BE PRETTY GOOD SAID SIR RICHMOND YOU KNOW THAT SHE HAS TOLD ME AS MUCH
7067-76047-0023 WELL SHE IMPRESSED ME AS HAVING THE AIR OF A GIRL WHO HAS HAD TO SOLVE MANY PROBLEMS FOR WHICH THE NORMAL MOTHER PROVIDES READY MADE SOLUTIONS THAT IS HOW I INFERRED THAT THERE WAS NO MOTHER I DON'T THINK THERE HAS BEEN ANY STEPMOTHER
7067-76047-0024 HER MANNER WITH MISS SEYFFERT AN EXCELLENT MANNER FOR MISS SEYFFERT BY THE BYE ISN'T THE SORT OF MANNER ANYONE ACQUIRES IN A DAY OR FOR ONE PERSON ONLY SHE IS A VERY SURE AND COMMANDING YOUNG WOMAN SIR RICHMOND NODDED
7067-76047-0025 I SUPPOSE HER FATHER ADORES AND NEGLECTS HER AND WHENEVER SHE HAS WANTED A COMPANION OR GOVERNESS BUTCHERED THE THING HAS BEEN DONE THESE BUSINESS AMERICANS I AM TOLD NEGLECT THEIR WOMENKIND GIVE THEM MONEY AND POWER LET THEM LOOSE ON THE WORLD
7067-76047-0026 IT IS A SORT OF MORAL LAZINESS MASQUERADING AS AFFECTION STILL I SUPPOSE CUSTOM AND TRADITION KEPT THIS GIRL IN HER PLACE AND SHE WAS PETTED HONOURED AMUSED
7067-76047-0027 TALKED ABOUT BUT NOT IN A HARMFUL WAY AND RATHER BORED RIGHT UP TO THE TIME WHEN AMERICA CAME INTO THE WAR THEORETICALLY SHE HAD A TREMENDOUSLY GOOD TIME I THINK THIS MUST BE NEAR THE TRUTH OF HER BIOGRAPHY SAID SIR RICHMOND
7067-76047-0028 I MEAN THAT SHE WAS SURROUNDED BY A RETINUE OF MEN WHO WANTED TO MARRY HER OR WHO BEHAVED AS THOUGH THEY WANTED TO MARRY HER OR WHO MADE HER HAPPINESS AND HER GRATIFICATIONS AND HER CONDESCENSIONS SEEM A MATTER OF VERY GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THEM
7067-76047-0029 SHE HAD THE FLATTERY OF AN EXTREMELY UNCRITICAL AND UNEXACTING ADMIRATION THAT IS THE SORT OF THING THAT GRATIFIES A SILLY WOMAN EXTREMELY MISS GRAMMONT IS NOT SILLY
7067-76047-0030 PROBABLY BORED HER MORE THAN SHE REALIZED TO ANYONE TOO INTELLIGENT TO BE STEADILY EXCITED BY BUYING THINGS AND WEARING THINGS AND DANCING AND PLAYING GAMES AND GOING TO PLACES OF ENTERTAINMENT AND BEING GIVEN FLOWERS SWEETS JEWELLERY
7067-76047-0031 AND THAT SHE HAD ALREADY READ AND THOUGHT RATHER MORE THAN MOST YOUNG WOMEN IN HER POSITION BEFORE SHE WAS TWENTY I GUESS SHE WAS ALREADY LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE INTERESTING IN THE WAY OF MEN THAN A RICH ADMIRER WITH AN AUTOMOBILE FULL OF PRESENTS THOSE WHO SEEK FIND
7067-76047-0032 WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE FOUND WHAT WOULD A RICH GIRL FIND OUT THERE IN AMERICA I DON'T KNOW I HAVEN'T THE MATERIAL TO GUESS WITH IN LONDON A GIRL MIGHT FIND A CONSIDERABLE VARIETY OF ACTIVE INTERESTING MEN RISING POLITICIANS UNIVERSITY MEN OF DISTINCTION
7067-76047-0033 SHE WOULD FIND THAT LIFE WAS WORTH WHILE TO SUCH PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT MADE THE ORDINARY ENTERTAINMENTS AND AMUSEMENTS OF HER LIFE A MONSTROUS SILLY WASTE OF TIME WITH THE FACILITY OF HER SEX SHE WOULD PICK UP FROM ONE OF THEM THE IDEA THAT MADE LIFE WORTH WHILE FOR HIM
7067-76047-0034 HARSH EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND VERY PROFOUND MENTAL DISTURBANCE THERE HAVE BEEN LOVE EXPERIENCES EXPERIENCES THAT WERE SOMETHING MORE THAN THE TREATS AND ATTENTIONS AND PROPOSALS THAT MADE UP HER LIFE WHEN SHE WAS SHELTERED OVER THERE
7067-76047-0035 AND SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT WHAT IT IS I DON'T KNOW THE WAR HAS TURNED AN UGLY FACE TO HER SHE HAS SEEN DEATH AND SUFFERING AND RUIN PERHAPS SHE HAS SEEN PEOPLE SHE KNEW KILLED PERHAPS THE MAN HAS BEEN KILLED
7067-76047-0036 OR SHE HAS MET WITH COWARDICE OR CRUELTY OR TREACHERY WHERE SHE DIDN'T EXPECT IT SHE HAS BEEN SHOCKED OUT OF THE FIRST CONFIDENCE OF YOUTH SHE HAS CEASED TO TAKE THE WORLD FOR GRANTED IT HASN'T BROKEN HER BUT IT HAS MATURED HER
7067-76047-0037 THAT I THINK IS WHY HISTORY HAS BECOME REAL TO HER WHICH SO ATTRACTS YOU IN HER HISTORY FOR HER HAS CEASED TO BE A FABRIC OF PICTURESQUE INCIDENTS IT IS THE STUDY OF A TRAGIC STRUGGLE THAT STILL GOES ON
7067-76047-0038 SHE SEES HISTORY AS YOU SEE IT AND I SEE IT SHE IS A VERY GROWN UP YOUNG WOMAN IT'S JUST THAT SAID SIR RICHMOND IT'S JUST THAT IF YOU SEE AS MUCH IN MISS GRAMMONT AS ALL THAT WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO COME ON WITH US YOU SEE THE INTEREST OF HER
7067-76047-0039 I SEE A LOT MORE THAN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT AN ADVANTAGE IT IS TO BE AS I AM RATHER COLD AND UNRESPONSIVE TO WOMEN AND UNATTRACTIVE AND NEGLIGIBLE NEGLIGIBLE THAT IS THE EXACT WORD TO THEM YOU CAN'T LOOK AT A WOMAN FOR FIVE MINUTES
7067-76047-0040 SEEMS TO IMPLY NECESSARILY A CERTAIN IMAGINATIVE FIXITY MISS GRAMMONT HAS AN IMPULSIVE AND ADVENTUROUS CHARACTER AND AS I HAVE BEEN SAYING SHE WAS A SPOILT CHILD WITH NO DISCIPLINE
7067-76047-0041 YOU ALSO ARE A PERSON OF HIGH INTELLIGENCE AND DEFECTIVE CONTROLS SHE IS VERY MUCH AT LOOSE ENDS YOU ON ACCOUNT OF THE ILLNESS OF THAT RATHER FORGOTTEN LADY MISS MARTIN LEEDS
7067-76047-0042 YOU I SAY ARE ALSO AT LOOSE ENDS CAN YOU DENY IT MY DEAR SIR DON'T WE BOTH KNOW THAT EVER SINCE WE LEFT LONDON YOU HAVE BEEN READY TO FALL IN LOVE WITH ANY PRETTY THING IN PETTICOATS THAT SEEMED TO PROMISE YOU THREE HA'PORTH OF KINDNESS
7067-76047-0043 GROTESQUELY HAPPEN HE SAID SHE KNOWS NOTHING OF MARTIN LEEDS YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT AND THEN HE ADDED IF SHE AND YOU FALL IN LOVE
7067-76047-0044 AS THE PHRASE GOES WHAT IS TO FOLLOW THERE WAS A PAUSE SIR RICHMOND LOOKED AT HIS TOES FOR A MOMENT OR SO AS IF HE TOOK COUNSEL WITH THEM AND THEN DECIDED TO TAKE OFFENCE
7067-76047-0045 REALLY HE SAID THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS YOU TALK OF FALLING IN LOVE AS THOUGH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A MAN AND WOMAN TO BE DEEPLY INTERESTED IN EACH OTHER WITHOUT THAT AND THE GULF IN OUR AGES IN OUR QUALITY
7067-76047-0046 FROM THE PSYCHOLOGIST OF A NEW AGE I FIND THIS AMAZING ARE MEN AND WOMEN TO GO ON FOR EVER SEPARATED BY THIS POSSIBILITY INTO TWO HARDLY COMMUNICATING AND YET INTERPENETRATING WORLDS
7067-76047-0047 IS THERE NEVER TO BE FRIENDSHIP AND COMPANIONSHIP BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN WITHOUT PASSION YOU OUGHT TO KNOW EVEN BETTER THAN I DO THAT THERE IS NOT FOR SUCH PEOPLE AS YOU TWO ANYHOW
7067-76047-0048 AND AT PRESENT THE WORLD IS NOT PREPARED TO TOLERATE FRIENDSHIP AND COMPANIONSHIP WITH THAT ACCOMPANIMENT THAT IS THE CORE OF THIS SITUATION A PAUSE FELL BETWEEN THE TWO GENTLEMEN
7067-76047-0049 THEY HAD SMOOTHED OVER THE EXTREME HARSHNESS OF THEIR SEPARATION AND THERE WAS VERY LITTLE MORE TO BE SAID WELL SAID SIR RICHMOND IN CONCLUSION I AM VERY SORRY INDEED MARTINEAU
7067-76048-0000 I LEAVE YOU TO IT HIS ROUND FACE BETRAYED LITTLE OR NO VESTIGES OF HIS OVERNIGHT IRRITATION OUGHT YOU TO LEAVE ME TO IT SMILED SIR RICHMOND I SHALL BE INTERESTED TO LEARN WHAT HAPPENS BUT IF YOU WON'T STAY TO SEE
7067-76048-0001 NOW SIR PLEASE SAID THE GUARD RESPECTFULLY BUT FIRMLY AND DOCTOR MARTINEAU GOT IN SIR RICHMOND WALKED THOUGHTFULLY DOWN THE PLATFORM TOWARDS THE EXIT WHAT ELSE COULD I DO HE ASKED ALOUD TO NOBODY IN PARTICULAR
7067-76048-0002 SECTION TWO FOR THE BETTER PART OF FORTY HOURS SIR RICHMOND HAD EITHER BEEN TALKING TO MISS GRAMMONT OR CARRYING ON IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS WITH HER IN HER ABSENCE
7067-76048-0003 AND SHE REPEATED NO REMEMBERED COMMENTS AND PROPHETS OF HER CONTEMPORARIES ABOUT HERSELF SHE EITHER CONCEALED OR SHE HAD LOST ANY GREAT INTEREST IN HER OWN PERSONALITY
7067-76048-0004 BUT SHE WAS INTERESTED IN AND CURIOUS ABOUT THE PEOPLE SHE HAD MET IN LIFE AND HER TALK OF THEM REFLECTED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF LIGHT UPON HER OWN UPBRINGING AND EXPERIENCES AND HER LIKING FOR SIR RICHMOND WAS PLEASINGLY MANIFEST
7067-76048-0005 SHE LIKED HIS TURN OF THOUGHT SHE WATCHED HIM WITH A FAINT SMILE ON HER LIPS AS HE SPOKE AND SHE SPREAD HER OPINIONS BEFORE HIM CAREFULLY IN THAT SOFT VOICE OF HERS LIKE A SHY CHILD SHOWING ITS TREASURES TO SOME SUDDENLY TRUSTED AND FAVOURED VISITOR
7067-76048-0006 AS A CRISIS IN WHICH THEY WERE CALLED UPON TO DO SOMETHING THEY DID NOT YET CLEARLY KNOW WHAT INTO THIS TOPIC THEY PEERED AS INTO SOME DEEP POOL SIDE BY SIDE AND IN IT THEY SAW EACH OTHER REFLECTED
7067-76048-0007 ITS DELIGHT WAS PARTICULARLY MANIFEST IN THE CREAM AND SALAD IT PRODUCED FOR LUNCH BOTH MISS GRAMMONT AND MISS SEYFFERT DISPLAYED AN INTELLIGENT INTEREST IN THEIR FOOD AFTER LUNCH THEY HAD ALL GONE OUT TO THE STONES AND THE WALL
7067-76048-0008 TO A HAPPY USE BY CLAMBERING TO THE TOP OF IT AND SLIDING ON THEIR LITTLE BEHINDS DOWN ITS SMOOTH AND SLOPING SIDE AMIDST MUCH MIRTHFUL SQUEALING
7067-76048-0009 SIR RICHMOND AND MISS GRAMMONT HAD WALKED ROUND THE OLD CIRCUMVALLATION TOGETHER BUT BELINDA SEYFFERT HAD STRAYED AWAY FROM THEM PROFESSING AN INTEREST IN FLOWERS
7067-76048-0010 THAT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO TAKE THIS CONFUSED OLD WORLD AND RESHAPE IT SET IT MARCHING TOWARDS THAT NEW WORLD OF YOURS OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FULLY DEVELOPED BEAUTIFUL AND HAPPY PEOPLE WHY NOT
7067-76048-0011 NOBODY IS DOING ANYTHING WITH THE WORLD EXCEPT MUDDLE ABOUT WHY NOT GIVE IT A DIRECTION YOU'D TAKE IT IN YOUR HANDS LIKE CLAY OBDURATE CLAY WITH A SORT OF RECALCITRANT UNINTELLIGENT LIFE OF ITS OWN
7067-76048-0012 HER IMAGINATION GLOWED IN HER EYES AND WARMED HER VOICE I BELIEVE WHAT YOU SAY IS POSSIBLE IF PEOPLE DARE I AM TIRED OF FOLLOWING LITTLE MOTIVES THAT ARE LIKE FLAMES THAT GO OUT WHEN YOU GET TO THEM
7067-76048-0013 I AM TIRED OF SEEING ALL THE WORLD DOING THE SAME I AM TIRED OF A WORLD IN WHICH THERE IS NOTHING GREAT BUT GREAT DISASTERS HERE IS SOMETHING MANKIND CAN ATTEMPT THAT WE CAN ATTEMPT AND WILL I BELIEVE THAT AS MANKIND GROWS UP
7067-76048-0014 AND PRIDE OURSELVES UPON OUR FREEDOM FROM THE SIN OF PRESUMPTION NOT QUITE THAT WELL HOW DO YOU PUT IT WE ARE AFRAID SHE SAID IT'S TOO VAST WE WANT BRIGHT LITTLE LIVES OF OUR OWN
7067-76048-0015 SENSIBLE LITTLE PIGGY WIGGYS WE HAVE A RIGHT TO LIFE AND HAPPINESS FIRST SAID SIR RICHMOND AS MUCH RIGHT AS A PIG HAS TO FOOD BUT WHETHER WE GET LIFE AND HAPPINESS OR FAIL TO GET THEM WE HUMAN BEINGS
7067-76048-0016 WHO HAVE IMAGINATIONS WANT SOMETHING MORE NOWADAYS OF COURSE WE WANT BRIGHT LIVES OF COURSE WE WANT HAPPINESS JUST AS WE WANT FOOD JUST AS WE WANT SLEEP BUT WHEN WE HAVE EATEN WHEN WE HAVE SLEPT WHEN WE HAVE JOLLY THINGS ABOUT US IT IS NOTHING
7067-76048-0017 WE HAVE BEEN MADE AN EXCEPTION OF AND GOT OUR RATIONS THE BIG THING CONFRONTS US STILL
7067-76048-0018 I DO NOT KNOW WHY IT SHOULD BE SO BUT I AM COMPELLED BY SOMETHING IN MY NATURE TO WANT TO SERVE THIS IDEA OF A NEW AGE FOR MANKIND I WANT IT AS MY CULMINATING WANT I WANT A WORLD IN ORDER
7067-76048-0019 A DISCIPLINED MANKIND GOING ON TO GREATER THINGS DON'T YOU NOW YOU TELL ME OF IT SHE SAID WITH A SMILE I DO BUT BEFORE NO YOU'VE MADE IT CLEAR IT WASN'T CLEAR BEFORE
7067-76048-0020 I'VE BEEN TALKING OF THIS SORT OF THING WITH MY FRIEND DOCTOR MARTINEAU AND I'VE BEEN THINKING AS WELL AS TALKING THAT PERHAPS IS WHY I'M SO CLEAR AND POSITIVE I DON'T COMPLAIN THAT YOU ARE CLEAR AND POSITIVE I'VE BEEN COMING ALONG THE SAME WAY
7067-76048-0021 IT'S REFRESHING TO MEET YOU I FOUND IT REFRESHING TO MEET MARTINEAU A TWINGE OF CONSCIENCE ABOUT DOCTOR MARTINEAU TURNED SIR RICHMOND INTO A NEW CHANNEL HE'S A MOST INTERESTING MAN HE SAID RATHER SHY IN SOME RESPECTS
7067-76048-0022 DEVOTED TO HIS WORK AND HE'S WRITING A BOOK WHICH HAS SATURATED HIM IN THESE IDEAS ONLY TWO NIGHTS AGO WE STOOD HERE AND TALKED ABOUT IT THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A NEW AGE THE WORLD HE BELIEVES IS ENTERING UPON A NEW PHASE IN ITS HISTORY
7067-76048-0023 THE ADOLESCENCE SO TO SPEAK OF MANKIND IT IS AN IDEA THAT SEIZES THE IMAGINATION THERE IS A FLOW OF NEW IDEAS ABROAD HE THINKS WIDENING REALIZATIONS UNPRECEDENTED HOPES AND FEARS
7067-76048-0024 THERE IS A CONSCIOUSNESS OF NEW POWERS AND NEW RESPONSIBILITIES WE ARE SHARING THE ADOLESCENCE OF OUR RACE IT IS GIVING HISTORY A NEW AND MORE INTIMATE MEANING FOR US
7067-76048-0025 MAKING THEM MATTER AS FORMERLY THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER THAT IDEA OF THE BRIGHT LITTLE PRIVATE LIFE HAS TO GO BY THE BOARD I SUPPOSE IT HAS SHE SAID MEDITATIVELY AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN THINKING OVER SOME SUCH QUESTION BEFORE
7067-76048-0026 INCIDENTALLY HE SMILED I WANT TO GET A LASSO OVER THE NECK OF THAT VERY FORCIBLE AND BARBARIC PERSON YOUR FATHER I AM DOING MY BEST TO HELP LAY THE FOUNDATION OF A SCIENTIFIC WORLD CONTROL OF FUEL PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION
7067-76048-0027 BUT CONTROLLING FATHER AS DISTINGUISHED FROM MANAGING HIM SHE REVIEWED SOME PRIVATE AND AMUSING MEMORIES HE IS A MOST INTRACTABLE MAN SECTION THREE
7067-76048-0028 THEY HAD GONE ON TO TALK OF HER FATHER AND OF THE TYPES OF MEN WHO CONTROLLED INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS SHE HAD HAD PLENTIFUL OPPORTUNITIES FOR OBSERVATION IN THEIR HOMES AND HER OWN
7067-76048-0029 GUNTER LAKE THE BIG BANKER SHE KNEW PARTICULARLY WELL BECAUSE IT SEEMED SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED OR WAS ENGAGED TO MARRY HIM ALL THESE PEOPLE SHE SAID ARE PUSHING THINGS ABOUT AFFECTING MILLIONS OF LIVES
7067-76048-0030 YOU WILL FIND MY FATHER EXTREMELY DIFFICULT BUT SOME OF OUR YOUNGER MEN WOULD LOVE IT AND SHE WENT ON THERE ARE AMERICAN WOMEN WHO'D LOVE IT TOO WE'RE PETTED WE'RE KEPT OUT OF THINGS WE AREN'T PLACED
7067-76048-0031 WE DON'T GET ENOUGH TO DO WE'RE SPENDERS AND WASTERS NOT ALWAYS FROM CHOICE WHILE THESE FATHERS AND BROTHERS AND HUSBANDS OF OURS PLAY ABOUT WITH THE FUEL AND POWER AND LIFE AND HOPE OF THE WORLD AS THOUGH IT WAS A GAME OF POKER
7067-76048-0032 WITH ALL THE EMPTY UNSPEAKABLE SOLEMNITY OF THE MALE AND TREAT US AS THOUGH WE OUGHT TO BE SATISFIED IF THEY BRING HOME PART OF THE WINNINGS THAT CAN'T GO ON SHE SAID HER EYES WENT BACK TO THE LONG LOW UNDULATING SKYLINE OF THE DOWNS
7067-76048-0033 SHE SPOKE AS THOUGH SHE TOOK UP THE THREAD OF SOME CONTROVERSY THAT HAD PLAYED A LARGE PART IN HER LIFE THAT ISN'T GOING ON SHE SAID WITH AN EFFECT OF CONCLUSIVE DECISION
7067-76048-0034 SIR RICHMOND RECALLED THAT LITTLE SPEECH NOW AS HE RETURNED FROM SALISBURY STATION TO THE OLD GEORGE AFTER HIS FAREWELL TO MARTINEAU HE RECALLED TOO THE SOFT FIRMNESS OF HER PROFILE AND THE DELICATE LINE OF HER LIFTED CHIN
7067-76048-0035 HE FELT THAT THIS TIME AT ANY RATE HE WAS NOT BEING DECEIVED BY THE OUTWARD SHOWS OF A CHARMING HUMAN BEING THIS YOUNG WOMAN HAD REAL FIRMNESS OF CHARACTER TO BACK UP HER FREE AND INDEPENDENT JUDGMENTS
7067-76048-0036 IN THE COMPOSITION OF SO SURE AND GALLANT A PERSONALITY MARTINEAU WAS VERY FINE MINDED IN MANY RESPECTS BUT HE WAS AN OLD MAID AND LIKE ALL OLD MAIDS HE SAW MAN AND WOMAN IN EVERY ENCOUNTER
7067-76048-0037 BUT PASSION WAS A THING MEN AND WOMEN FELL BACK UPON WHEN THEY HAD NOTHING ELSE IN COMMON WHEN THEY THOUGHT IN THE PLEASANTEST HARMONY AND EVERY REMARK SEEMED TO WEAVE A FRESH THREAD OF COMMON INTEREST THEN IT WASN'T SO NECESSARY IT MIGHT HAPPEN
7067-76048-0038 HER VIEWS ABOUT AMERICA AND ABOUT HER OWN PLACE IN THE WORLD SEEMED EQUALLY FRESH AND ORIGINAL TO SIR RICHMOND I REALIZE I'VE GOT TO BE A RESPONSIBLE AMERICAN CITIZEN SHE HAD SAID
7067-76048-0039 THAT DIDN'T MEAN THAT SHE ATTACHED VERY MUCH IMPORTANCE TO HER RECENTLY ACQUIRED VOTE SHE EVIDENTLY CLASSIFIED VOTERS INTO THE IRRESPONSIBLE WHO JUST HAD VOTES AND THE RESPONSIBLE WHO ALSO HAD A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY AS WELL
7067-76048-0040 SHE HAD NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT THE POWER OF THE FORMER CLASS IT DIDN'T EXIST THEY WERE STEERED TO THEIR DECISIONS BY PEOPLE EMPLOYED DIRECTED OR STIMULATED BY FATHER AND HIS FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES THE OWNERS OF AMERICA THE REAL RESPONSIBLE CITIZENS
7067-76048-0041 OR THEY FELL A PREY TO THE MERELY ADVENTUROUS LEADING OF REVOLUTIONARIES BUT ANYHOW THEY WERE STEERED SHE HERSELF IT WAS CLEAR WAS BOUND TO BECOME A VERY RESPONSIBLE CITIZEN INDEED
7067-76048-0042 SHE WOULD SOME DAY SHE LAUGHED BE SWIMMING IN OIL AND SUCH LIKE PROPERTY HER INTEREST IN SIR RICHMOND'S SCHEMES FOR A SCIENTIFIC WORLD MANAGEMENT OF FUEL WAS THEREFORE SHE REALIZED A VERY DIRECT ONE BUT IT WAS REMARKABLE TO FIND A YOUNG WOMAN SEEING IT LIKE THAT
7067-76048-0043 FATHER IT SEEMED VARIED VERY MUCH IN HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS HER HE DESPISED AND DISTRUSTED WOMEN GENERALLY AND IT WAS EVIDENT HE HAD MADE IT QUITE CLEAR TO HER HOW GRAVE AN ERROR IT WAS ON HER PART TO PERSIST IN BEING A DAUGHTER AND NOT A SON
7067-76048-0044 AT MOMENTS IT SEEMED TO SIR RICHMOND THAT SHE WAS DISPOSED TO AGREE WITH FATHER UPON THAT WHEN MISTER GRAMMONT'S SENSE OF HER REGRETTABLE FEMININITY WAS UPPERMOST
7067-76048-0045 AND THEN HE WOULD DIRECT HIS ATTENTION TO A KIND OF MASCULINIZATION OF HIS DAUGHTER AND TO SCHEMES FOR GIVING HER THE COMPLETEST CONTROL OF ALL HE HAD TO LEAVE HER PROVIDED SHE NEVER MARRIED NOR FELL UNDER MASCULINE SWAY AFTER ALL
7067-76048-0046 HE WOULD REFLECT AS HE HESITATED OVER THE PRACTICABILITY OF HIS LIFE'S IDEAL THERE WAS HETTY GREEN THIS LATTER IDEA HAD REFT HER SUDDENLY AT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN FROM THE EDUCATIONAL CARE OF AN ENGLISH GENTLEWOMAN WARRANTED TO FIT HER FOR MARRIAGE WITH ANY PRINCE IN EUROPE
7067-76048-0047 AFTER A SWIFT BUT COMPETENT TRAINING INTO A SHIRT WAIST AND AN OFFICE DOWN TOWN SHE HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED AT FIRST TO A HARVESTER CONCERN INDEPENDENT OF MISTER GRAMMONT BECAUSE HE FEARED HIS OWN PEOPLE WOULDN'T TRAIN HER HARD
7067-76048-0048 SHE HAD WORKED FOR ORDINARY WAGES AND ORDINARY HOURS AND AT THE END OF THE DAY SHE MENTIONED CASUALLY A LARGE AUTOMOBILE WITH TWO MENSERVANTS
7067-76048-0049 THIS MASCULINIZATION IDEA HAD ALSO SENT HER ON A COMMISSION OF ENQUIRY INTO MEXICO THERE APPARENTLY SHE HAD REALLY DONE RESPONSIBLE WORK BUT UPON THE QUESTION OF LABOUR MISTER GRAMMONT WAS FIERCE
7067-76048-0050 HE DISCOVERED HIS DAUGHTER DISPLAYING WHAT HE CONSIDERED AN IMPROPER FAMILIARITY WITH SOCIALIST IDEAS
7067-76048-0051 AND THE IDEA OF A MATRIMONIAL ALLIANCE WITH GUNTER LAKE GUNTER LAKE SIR RICHMOND GATHERED WASN'T HALF A BAD FELLOW GENERALLY IT WOULD SEEM MISS GRAMMONT LIKED HIM AND SHE HAD A WAY OF SPEAKING ABOUT HIM THAT SUGGESTED THAT IN SOME WAY
7067-76048-0052 MISTER LAKE HAD BEEN RATHER HARDLY USED AND HAD ACQUIRED MERIT BY HIS BEHAVIOUR UNDER BAD TREATMENT THERE WAS SOME STORY HOWEVER CONNECTED WITH HER WAR SERVICES IN EUROPE UPON WHICH MISS GRAMMONT WAS EVIDENTLY INDISPOSED TO DWELL
7067-76048-0053 STILL QUITE VAGUELY GUESSING SO MUCH FACT ABOUT MISS GRAMMONT AS WE HAVE GIVEN HAD FLOATED UP IN FRAGMENTS AND PIECED ITSELF TOGETHER IN SIR RICHMOND'S MIND IN THE COURSE OF A DAY AND A HALF THE FRAGMENTS CAME UP AS ALLUSIONS OR BY WAY OF ILLUSTRATION
7067-76048-0054 THE SUSTAINING TOPIC WAS THIS NEW AGE SIR RICHMOND FORE SHADOWED THIS WORLD UNDER SCIENTIFIC CONTROL THE UTOPIA OF FULLY DEVELOPED PEOPLE FULLY DEVELOPING THE RESOURCES OF THE EARTH
7067-76048-0055 FOR A NUMBER OF TRIVIAL REASONS SIR RICHMOND FOUND HIMSELF ASCRIBING THE PROJECT OF THIS NEW AGE ALMOST WHOLLY TO DOCTOR MARTINEAU AND PRESENTING IT AS A MUCH COMPLETER SCHEME THAN HE WAS JUSTIFIED IN DOING IT WAS TRUE THAT DOCTOR MARTINEAU HAD NOT SAID MANY OF THE THINGS SIR RICHMOND ASCRIBED TO HIM
7067-76048-0056 BUT ALSO IT WAS TRUE THAT THEY HAD NOT CRYSTALLIZED OUT IN SIR RICHMOND'S MIND BEFORE HIS TALKS WITH DOCTOR MARTINEAU THE IDEA OF A NEW AGE NECESSARILY CARRIES WITH IT THE IDEA OF FRESH RULES OF CONDUCT AND OF DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HUMAN BEINGS
7067-76048-0057 AND IT THROWS THOSE WHO TALK ABOUT IT INTO THE COMPANIONSHIP OF A COMMON ENTERPRISE TO MORROW THE NEW AGE WILL BE HERE NO DOUBT BUT TODAY IT IS THE HOPE AND ADVENTURE OF ONLY A FEW HUMAN BEINGS SO THAT IT WAS NATURAL FOR MISS GRAMMONT AND SIR RICHMOND TO ASK
7067-76048-0058 WHAT ARE WE TO DO WITH SUCH TYPES AS FATHER AND TO FALL INTO AN IDIOM THAT ASSUMED A JOINT ENTERPRISE THEY HAD AGREED BY A TACIT CONSENT TO A COMMON CONCEPTION OF THE WORLD THEY DESIRED AS A WORLD SCIENTIFICALLY ORDERED
7067-76048-0059 AN IMMENSE ORGANIZATION OF MATURE COMMONSENSE HEALTHY AND SECURE GATHERING KNOWLEDGE AND POWER FOR CREATIVE ADVENTURES AS YET BEYOND DREAMING
7067-76048-0060 AND REPLACEABLE STRUCTURES INDEED BOTH THESE TWO PEOPLE FOUND THEMSELVES THINKING IN THIS FASHION WITH AN UNWONTED COURAGE AND FREEDOM BECAUSE THE OTHER ONE HAD BEEN DISPOSED TO THINK IN THIS FASHION BEFORE
7078-271888-0000 WOMAN'S VANITY OFTEN OUTRUNS HER NATURAL DIFFIDENCE AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER GREAT BEAUTY STIFLES THE CONSCIENCE OF MODESTY VISITORS TO THE ACADEMY KNOW THE PICTURE CIRCE SEATED
7078-271888-0001 WITH HER BACK TO A GREAT CIRCULAR MIRROR PRESENTS A HALF DRAPED FIGURE OF MARVELLOUS DELICATE COLOURING AND BEAUTY OF OUTLINE ONE HAND HOLDS ALOFT A GOLDEN WINE GOBLET AND THE OTHER A TAPERING WAND
7078-271888-0002 WHILE UPON THE TESSELATED PAVEMENT BEFORE THE DAIS PURPLE GRAPES AND YELLOW ROSES HAVE BEEN STREWN THE BLACK HAIR OF THE DAUGHTER OF PERSEIS FALLS IN PROFUSION ABOUT HER BARE SHOULDERS AND STRAYS OVER HER BREAST
7078-271888-0003 BUT HER FEATURES ARE HIDDEN BY A HALF MASK OF BLACK SILK THE LIPS WITH THEIR ARC DE CUPIDON ARE SLIGHTLY PARTED DISCLOSING AN EVEN ROW OF PEARLY TEETH
7078-271888-0004 OF THE THOUSANDS WHO HAVE GAZED UPON IT IN ADMIRATION NONE KNOWS THE SOMEWHAT REMARKABLE STORY CONNECTED WITH IT AS I HAVE BEEN CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH IT FROM THE DAY IT WAS OUTLINED IN CHARCOAL
7078-271888-0005 UNTIL THE EVENING IT WAS PACKED IN A CRATE AND SENT FOR THE INSPECTION OF THE HANGING COMMITTEE IT IS PERHAPS APROPOS THAT I SHOULD RELATE THE NARRATIVE THE STUDIO OF MY OLD FRIEND DICK CARRUTHERS THE MAN WHO PAINTED IT
7078-271888-0006 IS ON CAMPDEN HILL KENSINGTON WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF WHERE I RESIDE AND IN THE CENTRE OF AN AESTHETIC ARTISTIC COLONY WE HAVE BEEN CHUMS FOR YEARS FOR ON MANY OCCASIONS HE HAS DISPLAYED HIS TALENT AS A BLACK AND WHITE ARTIST
7078-271888-0007 IN ILLUSTRATING MY ARTICLES AND STORIES IN VARIOUS MAGAZINES HE IS A POPULAR PAINTER AND AS HANDSOME A MAN AS EVER HAD A PICTURE ON THE LINE THREE YEARS AGO WHEN THE PROLOGUE OF THIS SECRET DRAMA WAS ENACTED
7078-271888-0008 HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF COMING OVER WHEN THE LIGHT HAD FADED TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE AND DISCUSS ART AND LITERATURE WITH ME I WAS GLAD OF A CHAT AFTER A HARD DAY'S WORK AT MY WRITING TABLE BUT HIS COMPANIONSHIP HAD ONE DRAWBACK
7078-271888-0009 HE DRIVELLED OVER A GIRL HE LOVED AND WAS FOREVER SUGGESTING THAT I MIGHT TAKE HER AS A CHARACTER AND DRAG HER INTO THE NOVEL UPON WHICH I WAS ENGAGED ONE DAY HE DREW A CABINET PHOTOGRAPH CAREFULLY FROM HIS POCKET
7078-271888-0010 AND PLACED IT UPON THE BLOTTING PAD BEFORE ME THE GIRL HE LOVED BAH I KNEW HER THOUGH I DID NOT TELL HIM SO SHE WAS A DARK HAIRED PINK AND WHITE BEAUTY THAT FLITTED THROUGH ARTISTIC BOHEMIA LIKE A BUTTERFLY IN A HOTHOUSE
7078-271888-0011 THE SIGHT OF THE PICTURED FACE BROUGHT BACK TO ME THE MEMORY OF DAYS LONG PAST OF A CLOSED CHAPTER IN MY LIFE'S HISTORY I REMEMBERED THE FIRST TIME I SAW ETHEL BROUGHTON FULLY FIVE YEARS BEFORE SHE WORE A SOILED PINK WRAPPER
7078-271888-0012 HER SATIN SLIPPERS WERE TRODDEN DOWN AT HEEL AND SHE HAD A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE AT HER ELBOW AT THAT TIME HER LOVER GRANDILOQUENT AND IMPECUNIOUS MISTER HARRY ORANMORE A BAD BUT HANDSOME ACTOR HAD BEEN UNTRUE TO HER
7078-271888-0013 AND SHE A THIRD RATE ACTRESS WHO HAD AN INGENUE PART AT A STRAND THEATRE
7078-271888-0014 BUT SHE SCARCELY HEEDED ME PROBABLY SHE WAS THINKING OF ORANMORE FOR SHE CLASPED HER SLIM FINGERS ROUND HER SUFFERING THROAT AND OFFERED UP AN OCCASIONAL SOB FOLLOWING IT WITH A SILENT BUT PROTRACTED DRAUGHT FROM HER GLASS
7078-271888-0015 THE RESULT OF THIS INTERVIEW WAS BUT NATURAL DAZZLED BY HER BEAUTY I SYMPATHISED WITH HER ENDEAVOURED TO CHEER HER AND CONCLUDED BY FALLING VIOLENTLY IN LOVE WITH HER AT THAT TIME I WAS WRITING NUMBERS OF DRAMATIC CRITICISMS
7078-271888-0016 AND I CONFESS I USED WHAT WEIGHT MY OPINIONS POSSESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF HER ADVANCEMENT IT IS NEEDLESS TO REFER TO THE SMOOTH AND UNINTERRUPTED COURSE OF OUR LOVE SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT WE WERE BOTH BOHEMIANS
7078-271888-0017 AND THAT WITHIN A YEAR I HAD THE SATISFACTION OF SITTING BEFORE THE FOOTLIGHTS WATCHING HER MAKE HER DEBUT AS LEADING LADY AT A WEST END THEATRE AND A FEW DAYS LATER OF OBSERVING HER PHOTOGRAPH EXHIBITED IN SHOP WINDOWS AMONG THOSE OF OTHER STAGE BEAUTIES
7078-271888-0018 BUT ALAS THOSE HALCYON DAYS WERE ALL TOO BRIEF SUDDENLY THE SCALES FELL FROM MY EYES A SCENE OCCURRED BETWEEN US AND WE PARTED TO THINK THAT SIN SHOULD LIE FOR YEARS IN THE BLOOD
7078-271888-0019 JUST AS ARSENIC DOES IN A CORPSE WHEN I DISCOVERED THAT DICK CARRUTHERS WAS WASTING THE VERY HONEST AND ARDENT EMOTIONS OF HIS HEART AT THIS FEVERISH FAIRY'S SHRINE I RESOLVED TO TAKE HIM ASIDE AND WITHOUT ADMITTING THAT I KNEW HER
7078-271888-0020 GIVE HIM A VERBAL DRUBBING I DID SO BUT HE BIT HIS MOUSTACHE FIERCELY AND TURNED UPON ME SHE IS CHARMING HE SAID AND I LOVE HER AH I KNOW THE TYPE
7078-271888-0021 YOU KNOW NOTHING OLD FELLOW HE EXCLAIMED FLUSHING ANGRILY BUT HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
7078-271888-0022 YOU SHALL SEE HER BEFORE LONG HIS GAZE GREW BRIGHT SOFT AND VAGUE AS ONE WHO CATCHES GLIMPSES OF THE FLOATING GARMENTS OF SUPERNATURAL MYSTERIES AH SHE IS LOVELY ONLY AN ARTIST CAN APPRECIATE HER BEAUTY
7078-271888-0023 HEEDLESS OF EVERYTHING UNDER THE SPELL SHE HAD CAST ABOUT HIM ONE NIGHT NOT LONG AFTER I HAD EXPRESSED MY SENTIMENTS TO HIM REGARDING HIS INFATUATION I ENTERED HIS STUDIO AND FOUND HIS GODDESS SEATED BY THE FIRE WITH HER SHAPELY FEET UPON THE FENDER
7078-271888-0024 AND HOLDING A LIGHTED CIGARETTE BETWEEN HER DAINTY FINGERS DICK FLUNG DOWN HIS PALETTE AND CAME FORWARD TO INTRODUCE ME HER DARK EYES MET MINE AND WE TACITLY AGREED NOT TO RECOGNISE EACH OTHER THEREFORE WE BOWED AS PERFECT STRANGERS
7078-271888-0025 I CAUGHT HER GLANCING FURTIVELY AT ME UNDER HER LONG LASHES SHE HAD GROWN EVEN HANDSOMER THAN WHEN LAST I HAD SEEN HER AND WAS THE PICTURE OF THE ROMANTIC BOHEMIENNE HER DRESS WAS OF BLACK GAUZE THROUGH WHICH THE MILKY WHITENESS OF HER FIGURE SEEMED TO SHINE
7078-271888-0026 YET AS SHE TURNED HER BEAUTIFUL FACE TOWARDS ME I WAS STRUCK BY THE COMPLETE EFFECT OF PHYSICAL AND MORAL FRAILTY THAT SHE PRESENTED SHE EXPRESSED PLEASURE AT MEETING ME REMARKING THAT SHE HAD READ MY LAST NOVEL AND HAD BEEN KEENLY INTERESTED IN IT
7078-271888-0027 WHEN I HAD BRIEFLY ACKNOWLEDGED THE COMPLIMENT SHE PAID ME SHE SAID ONE THING ALWAYS STRIKES ME IN READING YOUR STORIES YOUR WOMEN ARE INEVITABLY FALSE AND FICKLE PERHAPS HOWEVER YOU WRITE FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
7078-271888-0028 OF THE FAILINGS OF MY SEX SHE LAUGHED GLANCING SHARPLY AT HER I SAW THAT HER EYES DID NOT WAVER IT IS TRUE I ONCE KNEW A WOMAN WHO PROVED FALSE AND INFAMOUS I REPLIED WITH SOME EMPHASIS

7078-271888-0061 HE WAS SUCH A LARGE HEARTED HONEST FELLOW THAT I FELT QUITE PAINED WHEN I ANTICIPATED THE AWAKENING THAT MUST INEVITABLY COME SOONER OR LATER HE KNEW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OF HER PAST AND WAS QUITE IGNORANT THAT SHE HAD BEEN A POPULAR ACTRESS
7078-271888-0062 IN THE MONTHS THAT FOLLOWED I VISITED THE STUDIO ALMOST DAILY AND WATCHED THE GROWTH OF THE PICTURE
7078-271888-0063 THE DELICATE TINTS OF THE NECK AND ARMS WERE REPRODUCED WITH A SKILL THAT BETRAYED THE MASTER HAND
7078-271888-0064 I RETURNED HOME FROM A STROLL ACROSS KENSINGTON GARDENS
7078-271888-0065 HEARD SOME ONE PLAYING UPON MY PIANO AND A SWEET SOPRANO VOICE SINGING TROTERE'S IN OLD MADRID I RECOGNISED THE CLEAR TONES AS THOSE OF ETHEL AH HAROLD SHE CRIED JUMPING UP AS I ENTERED THE ROOM

7078-271888-0070 TEARS WELLED IN HER EYES SHE NODDED BUT DID NOT REPLY A DRY GREY DAY IN MARCH IT WAS SHOW SUNDAY THAT INSTITUTION IN THE ART WORLD WHEN THE PAINTER OPENS HIS STUDIO TO HIS FRIENDS AND THE PUBLIC
7078-271888-0071 TO SHOW THEM THE PICTURE HE IS ABOUT TO SEND TO THE ACADEMY THE EXHIBITION IS IN MANY INSTANCES BUT THE SHOWING BEFOREHAND OF THE GARLANDS OF VICTORY IN A BATTLE WHICH IS DOOMED TO BE LOST FOR WHEN THE OPENING DAY COMES
7078-271888-0072 HAS NO SUCH ORDEAL TO FACE HE NEVER READS HIS NEW ROMANCE TO HIS FRIENDS NOR DO HIS WELL WISHERS APPLAUD IN ADVANCE REVIEWERS HAVE FIRST TILT AT ADVANCE COPIES AND VERY PROPERLY
7078-271888-0073 FROM MORN TILL EVE ON SHOW SUNDAY CAMPDEN HILL IS ALWAYS BLOCKED BY THE CARRIAGES OF THE CURIOUS AND STUDIOS ARE BESIEGED BY FASHIONABLE CROWDS WHOSE CHATTER AND LAUGHTER MINGLES PLEASANTLY WITH THE CLINKING OF TEA CUPS
7078-271888-0074 ON THIS OCCASION AS ON PREVIOUS ONES I ASSISTED DICK TO RECEIVE HIS VISITORS BUT UNFORTUNATELY ETHEL HAD BEEN TAKEN SUDDENLY UNWELL AND COULD NOT ATTEND MY ANTICIPATIONS PROVED CORRECT
7078-271888-0075 THE OPINIONS OF CRITICS WHO DROPPED IN WERE UNANIMOUS THAT IT WAS THE ARTIST'S MASTERPIECE AND THAT THE EXPRESSION AND GENERAL CONCEPTION WERE MARVELLOUS A VERDICT ENDORSED BY GUSHING SOCIETY WOMEN BORED CLUB MEN AND THE INANE JEUNESSE DOREE
7078-271888-0076 A SCRAP OF CONVERSATION I OVERHEARD IN THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON HOWEVER CAUSED ME TO PONDER AN ELDERLY MAN EVIDENTLY A FOREIGNER WEARING THE VIOLET RIBBON OF THE FRENCH ACADEMY IN HIS BUTTONHOLE
7078-271888-0077 WAS STANDING WITH A YOUNG GIRL IN THE CROWD AROUND THE EASEL WHY LOOK PAPA THAT FACE THE GIRL CRIED WHEN HER EYES FELL UPON THE CANVAS IT IS HER PORTRAIT SURELY THE SIGNORE CANNOT KNOW DIO
7078-271888-0078 EXCLAIMED THE OLD MAN EVIDENTLY RECOGNISING THE FEATURES THE PICTURE IS INDEED MAGNIFICENT
7078-271888-0079 COME AWAY ZELIE LET US GO I HEARD NO MORE FOR THEY TURNED AND LEFT HAVING ACTED AS EAVESDROPPER I COULD HARDLY QUESTION THEM NEVERTHELESS I WAS SORELY PUZZLED LOOK READ THAT
7078-271888-0080 IN SURPRISE I GLANCED UP FROM MY WORK OF ROMANCE WEAVING ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING AND SAW DICK PALE AND AGITATED STANDING AT MY ELBOW THE LETTER HE PLACED BEFORE ME WAS IN A WOMAN'S HAND AND EMITTED THE FAINTEST BREATH OF VIOLETS
7078-271888-0081 A GLANCE WAS SUFFICIENT TO RECOGNISE THAT THE SPRAWLY WRITING WAS ETHEL'S TAKING IT UP I EAGERLY READ THE FOLLOWING LINES IT CONTAINED DEAR DICK I REGRET TO TELL YOU THAT CIRCUMSTANCES PRECLUDE ME FROM EVER MEETING YOU AGAIN
7078-271888-0082 I AM GOING FAR AWAY WHERE YOU CANNOT FIND ME IT WAS FOOLISH FOR US TO HAVE LOVED THEREFORE FORGET ME THAT YOU MAY MEET SOME ONE FAR WORTHIER THAN MYSELF
7078-271888-0083 MAY BRING YOU FAME AND FORTUNE IS THE MOST SINCERE HOPE OF YOUR MODELS ETHEL I WARNED YOU AGAINST YOUR INFATUATION OLD FELLOW I SAID SERIOUSLY BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT I I LOVED HER
7078-271888-0084 WHILE HIS FACE ASSUMED A HARD DETERMINED EXPRESSION
7078-271888-0085 AND SHE HAD HER FOOT UPON MY NECK BUT IT IS ALL OVER HE ADDED BITTERLY I SHALL THINK NO MORE OF HER THEN HE WISHED ME AN ABRUPT FAREWELL AND LEFT
7078-271888-0086 THAT EVENING I CALLED AT DICK'S HOUSE BUT WAS INFORMED BY HIS HOUSEKEEPER THAT HE HAD PACKED HIS BAG AND DEPARTED STATING THAT HE WOULD NOT RETURN FOR AT LEAST A MONTH PERHAPS LONGER WHEN I ENTERED THE STUDIO GLOOMY IN THE TWILIGHT
7078-271888-0087 AND THAT IT WAS STANDING IN A CORNER WITH ITS FACE TO THE WALL
7078-271888-0088 AND WHEN I DID SO I DISCOVERED TO MY DISMAY THAT IN HIS FRENZY OF MAD DESPAIR
7078-271888-0089 AND DRAWN IT ACROSS THE FACE MAKING A GREAT UGLY DISFIGURING DAUB OVER THE FOREHEAD AND EYEBROWS UTTERLY RUINING THE FEATURES AND PRODUCING A CURIOUSLY FORBIDDING EFFECT THE COLOUR WAS NOT DRY
7078-271888-0090 THEREFORE I WAS ENABLED TO REMOVE THE GREATER PORTION OF IT WITH A SILK HANDKERCHIEF BUT I SAW WITH REGRET THAT THE TINTS OF THE FOREHEAD HAD BEEN IRRETRIEVABLY RUINED RENDERING THE PICTURE VALUELESS THE DAYS WENT BY
7078-271888-0091 THE LIMIT FOR SENDING IN TO THE ACADEMY WAS APPROACHING BUT DICK DID NOT WRITE AND I COULD ONLY WONDER VAGUELY WHERE HE WAS WANDERING IT WAS A GREAT PITY I THOUGHT THAT SUCH A FINE WORK SHOULD NOT BE EXHIBITED
7078-271888-0092 YET THE WILFUL OBLITERATION HAD UTTERLY SPOILED IT WHILE SITTING IN HIS STUDIO MUSING ONE DAY IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO ME THAT IF THE FLAW UPON THE FOREHEAD COULD BE HIDDEN IT MIGHT AFTER ALL BE SENT FOR THE INSPECTION OF THE HANGING COMMITTEE
7078-271888-0093 TAKING IT UP I EXAMINED IT MINUTELY IN THE LIGHT THE IDEA OF PLACING A HALF MASK UPON THE FACE SUGGESTED ITSELF AND WITHOUT DELAY I PROCEEDED TO CARRY IT INTO EFFECT
7078-271888-0094 ENABLED ME TO PAINT IN THE HALF LIGHTS UPON THE BLACK SILK AND THE LAUGHING EYES BEING FORTUNATELY INTACT I ALLOWED THEM TO PEER THROUGH THE APERTURES THE EFFECT PRODUCED WAS STARTLING
7078-271888-0095 THE MASK SEEMED TO INCREASE THE RECKLESS DIABLERIE OF ITS WEARER AND ENHANCE THE FAIRNESS OF THE COMPLEXION WHILE IT ADDED AN AIR OF MYSTERY NOT AT ALL UNPLEASING TO THE EYE A FEW DAYS LATER I DISPATCHED IT TO THE ACADEMY
7078-271888-0096 AND WAITED PATIENTLY FOR THE OPENING DAY WHEN I EXPERIENCED THE MINGLED SURPRISE AND SATISFACTION OF SEEING IT HUNG UPON THE LINE
7078-271888-0097 WAS PRONOUNCED ONE OF THE PICTURES OF THE YEAR THOUSANDS ADMIRED IT THE PAPERS WERE FULL OF LAUDATORY NOTICES BUT THE MAN WHO PAINTED IT UNAWARE OF THE FAME HE HAD SUDDENLY ACHIEVED WAS HIDING HIS SORROW SOMEWHERE IN THE VOSGES
7078-271888-0098 A STRAY COPY OF AN ENGLISH NEWSPAPER CONTAINING A NOTICE OF HIS WORK WHICH DICK PICKED UP IN A HOTEL HOWEVER CAUSED HIM TO RETURN HE BURST INTO MY ROOM UNCEREMONIOUSLY ONE MORNING STILL ATTIRED IN HIS TRAVELLING ULSTER
7078-271888-0099 I SAW THAT HE WAS HAGGARD EYED AND WILD LOOKING FROM HIS CONVERSATION I KNEW THAT TIME HAD NOT HEALED THE WOUND IN HIS HEART I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO THANK YOU SUFFICIENTLY OLD CHAP FOR TOUCHING UP MY DAUB
7078-271888-0100 IT SEEMS THAT THE PUBLIC ADMIRE HER AS MUCH AS I HAVE DONE I I SHALL FIND HER SOME DAY THEN SHE WILL RETURN TO ME STILL THINKING OF HER I OBSERVED REPROACHFULLY YES ALWAYS
7078-271888-0101 ALWAYS HE REPLIED SHAKING HIS HEAD SORROWFULLY I I CANNOT FORGET DICK'S POPULARITY STEADILY INCREASED LUCRATIVE COMMISSIONS POURED IN UPON HIM AND HE SETTLED DOWN TO SUCH HARD
7078-271888-0102 METHODICAL WORK THAT I BEGAN TO THINK HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE WOMAN WHO HAD ENMESHED HIM WITH BEAMING FACE HE CAME TO ME ONE SUMMER'S MORNING AND ANNOUNCED THAT ALTHOUGH THE COMMITTEE OF THE CHANTREY BEQUEST HAD OFFERED TO PURCHASE THE MASKED CIRCE HE
7078-271888-0103 THE WELL KNOWN ANGLO ITALIAN MILLIONAIRE AND ART PATRON SAYING THAT HE DESIRED TO BUY IT AND ASKING HIM TO GO DOWN TO OXTED PARK HIS SEAT IN SURREY TO ARRANGE THE PRICE I AM GOING TO DAY HE SAID YOU MASKED HER
7078-271888-0104 AND CONGRATULATED DICK WARMLY UPON HIS MASTERPIECE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE MEANT TO SECURE IT AT ANY COST
7078-271888-0105 MY COMPANION HAD A CHEQUE FOR FOUR FIGURES IN HIS POCKET WE WERE ABOUT TO MAKE OUR ADIEUX BUT THE COUNT WOULD NOT HEAR OF IT DINNER WILL BE READY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY HE SAID YOU MUST STAY
7078-271888-0106 AH HERE'S THE COUNTESS EXCLAIMED THE MILLIONAIRE STEPPING FORWARD TO INTRODUCE US WE TURNED AND SAW A PALE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN ATTIRED IN A HANDSOME DINNER GOWN ETHEL YOU

7078-271888-0110 TO INQUIRE AFTER THE COUNTESS'S HEALTH THE FOOTMAN LOOKED PALE AND GRAVE WHEN I ASKED AFTER HER LADYSHIP I MUCH REGRET TO INFORM YOU SIR THAT MY MISTRESS IS DEAD HE SAID
7078-271888-0111 DEAD I CRIED IMPOSSIBLE YES SIR HER MAID DISCOVERED HER IN HER BOUDOIR LATE LAST NIGHT AND FOUND THAT SHE HAD TAKEN AN OVERDOSE OF MORPHIA WE SENT FOR THE DOCTOR
7078-271888-0112 BUT BEFORE HIS ARRIVAL LIFE WAS EXTINCT THE COUNT IS INSANE WITH GRIEF MORE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE MAID DISCOVERED THAT HER LADYSHIP HAD LEFT A LETTER TO SOME MAN SHE CALLS DICK TELLING HIM THAT SHE LOVED HIM
7078-271888-0113 AND COULD LIVE NO LONGER DICK RARELY SMILES AND IS INVARIABLY GLOOMY AND SAD POOR FELLOW THE COUNT IGNORANT OF THE TRUTH HAS HUNG HIS LATEST PURCHASE
7078-271888-0114 IN THE PRIVATE GALLERY OF HIS GREAT PALACE IN ROME LITTLE DREAMING THAT
7113-86041-0000 RUBEZAHL OVER ALL THE VAST UNDER WORLD THE MOUNTAIN GNOME RUBEZAHL WAS LORD AND BUSY ENOUGH THE CARE OF HIS DOMINIONS KEPT HIM THERE WERE THE ENDLESS TREASURE CHAMBERS TO BE GONE THROUGH
7113-86041-0001 AND THE HOSTS OF GNOMES TO BE KEPT TO THEIR TASKS SOME BUILT STRONG BARRIERS TO HOLD BACK THE FIERY VAPOURS TO CHANGE DULL STONES TO PRECIOUS METAL OR WERE HARD AT WORK FILLING EVERY CRANNY OF THE ROCKS WITH DIAMONDS AND RUBIES
7113-86041-0002 FOR RUBEZAHL LOVED ALL PRETTY THINGS SOMETIMES THE FANCY WOULD TAKE HIM TO LEAVE THOSE GLOOMY REGIONS AND COME OUT UPON THE GREEN EARTH FOR A WHILE AND BASK IN THE SUNSHINE AND HEAR THE BIRDS SING
7113-86041-0003 AND AS GNOMES LIVE MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS HE SAW STRANGE THINGS FOR THE FIRST TIME HE CAME UP THE GREAT HILLS WERE COVERED WITH THICK FORESTS
7113-86041-0004 TO HEAR THE THUNDER OF THEIR FALL ECHOING AMONG THE HILLS BUT THE NEXT TIME HE VENTURED ABOVE GROUND WHAT WAS HIS SURPRISE TO FIND EVERYTHING CHANGED THE DARK WOODS WERE HEWN DOWN
7113-86041-0005 AND IN THEIR PLACE APPEARED BLOSSOMING ORCHARDS SURROUNDING COSY LOOKING THATCHED COTTAGES FOR EVERY CHIMNEY THE BLUE SMOKE CURLED PEACEFULLY INTO THE AIR SHEEP AND OXEN FED IN THE FLOWERY MEADOWS
7113-86041-0006 CAME THE MUSIC OF THE SHEPHERD'S PIPE THE STRANGENESS AND PLEASANTNESS OF THE SIGHT SO DELIGHTED THE GNOME THAT HE NEVER THOUGHT OF RESENTING THE INTRUSION OF THESE UNEXPECTED GUESTS WHO WITHOUT SAYING BY YOUR LEAVE OR WITH YOUR LEAVE
7113-86041-0007 NOR DID HE WISH TO INTERFERE WITH THEIR DOINGS BUT LEFT THEM IN QUIET POSSESSION OF THEIR HOMES AS A GOOD HOUSEHOLDER LEAVES IN PEACE THE SWALLOWS WHO HAVE BUILT THEIR NESTS UNDER HIS EAVES
7113-86041-0008 HE WAS INDEED GREATLY MINDED TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH THIS BEING CALLED MAN SO TAKING THE FORM OF AN OLD FIELD LABOURER HE ENTERED THE SERVICE OF A FARMER UNDER HIS CARE ALL THE CROPS FLOURISHED EXCEEDINGLY
7113-86041-0009 BUT THE MASTER PROVED TO BE WASTEFUL AND UNGRATEFUL AND RUBEZAHL SOON LEFT HIM AND WENT TO BE SHEPHERD TO HIS NEXT NEIGHBOUR
7113-86041-0010 AND WHERE AMONG THE HILLS TO LOOK FOR ANY WHO STRAYED AWAY THAT THEY TOO PROSPERED UNDER HIS CARE AND NOT ONE WAS LOST OR TORN BY WOLVES BUT THIS NEW MASTER WAS A HARD MAN AND BEGRUDGED HIM HIS WELL EARNED WAGES
7113-86041-0011 SO HE RAN AWAY AND WENT TO SERVE THE JUDGE HERE HE UPHELD THE LAW WITH MIGHT AND MAIN AND WAS A TERROR TO THIEVES AND EVILDOERS BUT THE JUDGE WAS A BAD MAN WHO TOOK BRIBES AND DESPISED THE LAW
7113-86041-0012 DOWN TO HIS UNDERGROUND PALACE VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED BY HIS FIRST EXPERIENCE OF MANKIND BUT AS TIME WENT ON HE FORGOT THE DISAGREEABLE THINGS THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM AND THOUGHT HE WOULD TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE UPPER WORLD
7113-86041-0013 WHERE STOOD A CHARMING MAIDEN FRESH AS THE SPRING AND BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK UPON AROUND HER UPON THE GRASS LAY HER YOUNG COMPANIONS AS IF THEY HAD THROWN THEMSELVES DOWN TO REST AFTER SOME MERRY GAME
7113-86041-0014 BEYOND THEM FLOWED A LITTLE BROOK INTO WHICH A WATERFALL LEAPT FROM A HIGH ROCK FILLING THE AIR WITH ITS PLEASANT SOUND AND MAKING A COOLNESS EVEN IN THE SULTRY NOONTIDE
7113-86041-0015 THE SIGHT OF THE MAIDEN SO PLEASED THE GNOME THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME HE WISHED HIMSELF A MORTAL AND LONGING FOR A BETTER VIEW OF THE GAY COMPANY HE CHANGED HIMSELF INTO A RAVEN
7113-86041-0016 HE COULD ONLY SEE WITH A RAVEN'S EYES AND FEEL AS A RAVEN FEELS AND A NEST OF FIELD MICE AT THE FOOT OF THE TREE INTERESTED HIM FAR MORE THAN THE SPORT OF THE MAIDENS
7113-86041-0017 WHEN HE UNDERSTOOD THIS HE FLEW DOWN AGAIN IN A GREAT HURRY INTO THE THICKET AND TOOK THE FORM OF A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN THAT WAS THE BEST WAY AND HE FELL IN LOVE WITH THE GIRL THEN AND THERE
7113-86041-0018 THE FAIR MAIDEN WAS THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF THE COUNTRY AND SHE OFTEN WANDERED IN THE FOREST WITH HER PLAY FELLOWS GATHERING THE WILD FLOWERS AND FRUITS TILL THE MIDDAY HEAT DROVE THE MERRY BAND TO THE SHADY LAWN
7113-86041-0019 BY THE BROOK TO REST OR TO BATHE IN THE COOL WATERS ON THIS PARTICULAR MORNING THE FANCY TOOK THEM TO WANDER OFF AGAIN INTO THE WOOD THIS
7113-86041-0020 STEPPING OUT OF HIS HIDING PLACE
7113-86041-0021 WEAVING HIS MAGIC SPELLS TILL SLOWLY ALL ABOUT HIM CHANGED AND WHEN THE MAIDENS RETURNED AT NOON TO THEIR FAVOURITE RESTING PLACE THEY STOOD LOST IN AMAZEMENT AND ALMOST FANCIED THAT THEY MUST BE DREAMING
7113-86041-0022 THE RED ROCKS HAD BECOME WHITE MARBLE AND ALABASTER THE STREAM THAT MURMURED AND STRUGGLED BEFORE IN ITS ROCKY BED FLOWED IN SILENCE NOW IN ITS SMOOTH CHANNEL FROM WHICH A CLEAR FOUNTAIN LEAPT
7113-86041-0023 AS THE WANDERING BREEZE SCATTERED IT DAISIES AND FORGET ME NOTS FRINGED ITS BRINK WHILE TALL HEDGES OF ROSES AND JASMINE RINGED IT ROUND MAKING THE SWEETEST AND DAINTIEST BOWER IMAGINABLE
7113-86041-0024 WERE SPREAD OUT STRANGE FRUITS AND SWEETMEATS THE VERY SIGHT OF WHICH MADE THE PRINCESS LONG TO TASTE THEM SHE HESITATED A WHILE HOWEVER SCARCELY ABLE TO BELIEVE HER EYES
7113-86041-0025 BUT AT LENGTH CURIOSITY PREVAILED AND SHE AND HER COMPANIONS EXPLORED TO THEIR HEART'S CONTENT
7113-86041-0026 RUNNING HITHER AND THITHER IN HIGH GLEE AND CALLING MERRILY TO EACH OTHER AT LAST WHEN THEY WERE QUITE WEARY THE PRINCESS CRIED OUT SUDDENLY THAT NOTHING WOULD CONTENT HER BUT TO BATHE IN THE MARBLE POOL
7113-86041-0027 WHICH CERTAINLY DID LOOK VERY INVITING AND THEY ALL WENT GAILY TO THIS NEW AMUSEMENT THE PRINCESS WAS READY FIRST BUT SCARCELY HAD SHE SLIPPED OVER THE RIM OF THE POOL WHEN DOWN DOWN DOWN SHE SANK
7113-86041-0028 AND VANISHED IN ITS DEPTHS BEFORE HER FRIGHTENED PLAYMATES COULD SEIZE HER BY SO MUCH AS A LOCK OF HER FLOATING GOLDEN HAIR LOUDLY DID THEY WEEP AND WAIL RUNNING ABOUT THE BRINK OF THE POOL WHICH LOOKED SO SHALLOW AND SO CLEAR
7113-86041-0029 BUT WHICH HAD SWALLOWED UP THEIR PRINCESS BEFORE THEIR EYES THEY EVEN SPRANG INTO THE WATER AND TRIED TO DIVE AFTER HER BUT IN VAIN THEY ONLY FLOATED LIKE CORKS IN THE ENCHANTED POOL AND COULD NOT KEEP UNDER WATER FOR A SECOND
7113-86041-0030 THEY SAW AT LAST THAT THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO CARRY TO THE KING THE SAD TIDINGS OF HIS BELOVED DAUGHTER'S DISAPPEARANCE AND WHAT GREAT WEEPING AND LAMENTATION THERE WAS IN THE PALACE WHEN THE DREADFUL NEWS WAS TOLD
7113-86041-0031 THE SCENE OF THIS STRANGE ADVENTURE THINKING AS PEOPLE WILL IN SORROW THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME MISTAKE AFTER ALL BUT WHEN HE REACHED THE SPOT BEHOLD ALL WAS CHANGED AGAIN
7113-86041-0032 THE GLITTERING GROTTO DESCRIBED TO HIM BY THE MAIDENS HAD COMPLETELY VANISHED AND SO HAD THE MARBLE BATH THE BOWER OF JASMINE INSTEAD ALL WAS A TANGLE OF FLOWERS AS IT HAD BEEN OF OLD
7113-86041-0033 THE KING WAS SO MUCH PERPLEXED THAT HE THREATENED THE PRINCESS'S PLAYFELLOWS WITH ALL SORTS OF PUNISHMENTS IF THEY WOULD NOT CONFESS SOMETHING ABOUT HER DISAPPEARANCE BUT AS THEY ONLY REPEATED THE SAME STORY HE PRESENTLY PUT DOWN THE WHOLE AFFAIR TO THE WORK OF SOME
7113-86041-0034 SPRITE OR GOBLIN AND TRIED TO CONSOLE HIMSELF FOR HIS LOSS BY ORDERING A GRAND HUNT FOR KINGS CANNOT BEAR TO BE TROUBLED ABOUT ANYTHING LONG MEANWHILE THE PRINCESS WAS NOT AT ALL UNHAPPY
7113-86041-0035 THEY SWAM WITH HER QUICKLY BY STRANGE UNDERGROUND WAYS TO A PALACE SO SPLENDID THAT HER FATHER'S SEEMED BUT A POOR COTTAGE IN COMPARISON WITH IT AND WHEN SHE RECOVERED FROM HER ASTONISHMENT SHE FOUND HERSELF SEATED UPON A COUCH
7113-86041-0036 WRAPPED IN A WONDERFUL ROBE OF SATIN FASTENED WITH A SILKEN GIRDLE WHILE BESIDE HER KNELT A YOUNG MAN WHO WHISPERED THE SWEETEST SPEECHES IMAGINABLE IN HER EAR THE GNOME FOR HE IT WAS TOLD HER ALL ABOUT HIMSELF
7113-86041-0037 AND HIS GREAT UNDERGROUND KINGDOM AND PRESENTLY LED HER THROUGH THE MANY ROOMS AND HALLS OF THE PALACE AND SHOWED HER THE RARE AND WONDERFUL THINGS DISPLAYED IN THEM TILL SHE WAS FAIRLY DAZZLED AT THE SIGHT OF SO MUCH SPLENDOUR
7113-86041-0038 ON THREE SIDES OF THE CASTLE LAY A LOVELY GARDEN WITH MASSES OF GAY SWEET FLOWERS AND VELVET LAWNS ALL COOL AND SHADY WHICH PLEASED THE EYE OF THE PRINCESS THE FRUIT TREES WERE HUNG WITH GOLDEN AND ROSY APPLES
7113-86041-0039 AND NIGHTINGALES SANG IN EVERY BUSH AS THE GNOME AND THE PRINCESS WANDERED IN THE LEAFY ALLEYS SOMETIMES GAZING AT THE MOON SOMETIMES PAUSING TO GATHER THE RAREST FLOWERS FOR HER ADORNMENT
7113-86041-0040 BUT THE PRINCESS FELT NO SUCH HAPPINESS IN SPITE OF ALL THE MAGIC DELIGHTS AROUND HER SHE WAS SAD THOUGH SHE TRIED TO SEEM CONTENT FOR FEAR OF DISPLEASING THE GNOME HOWEVER HE SOON PERCEIVED HER MELANCHOLY
7113-86041-0041 AND IN A THOUSAND WAYS STROVE TO DISPEL THE CLOUD BUT IN VAIN AT LAST HE SAID TO HIMSELF MEN ARE SOCIABLE CREATURES LIKE BEES OR ANTS
7113-86041-0042 WHO IS THERE I CAN FIND FOR HER TO TALK TO
7113-86041-0043 CARROTS TURNIPS AND RADISHES AND LAYING THEM CAREFULLY IN AN ELEGANT BASKET BROUGHT THEM TO THE PRINCESS WHO SAT PENSIVE IN THE SHADE OF THE ROSE BOWER LOVELIEST DAUGHTER OF EARTH SAID THE GNOME BANISH ALL SORROW
7113-86041-0044 NO MORE SHALL YOU BE LONELY IN MY DWELLING
7113-86041-0045 TAKE THIS LITTLE MANY COLOURED WAND AND WITH A TOUCH GIVE TO EACH ROOT THE FORM YOU DESIRE TO SEE WITH THIS HE LEFT HER AND THE PRINCESS WITHOUT AN INSTANT'S DELAY OPENED THE BASKET
7113-86041-0046 THIS SUDDEN APPEARANCE WAS SO DELIGHTFUL THAT THE PRINCESS COULD HARDLY BELIEVE HER OWN EYES AND WAS QUITE BESIDE HERSELF WITH THE JOY OF HAVING HER DEAR PLAYFELLOW WITH HER ONCE MORE HAND IN HAND THEY WANDERED ABOUT THE ENCHANTED GARDEN
7113-86041-0047 AND GATHERED THE GOLDEN APPLES FROM THE TREES AND WHEN THEY WERE TIRED OF THIS AMUSEMENT THE PRINCESS LED HER FRIEND THROUGH ALL THE WONDERFUL ROOMS OF THE PALACE UNTIL AT LAST THEY CAME TO THE ONE IN WHICH WERE KEPT ALL THE MARVELLOUS DRESSES AND ORNAMENTS
7113-86041-0048 THE GNOME HAD GIVEN TO HIS HOPED FOR BRIDE THERE THEY FOUND SO MUCH TO AMUSE THEM THAT THE HOURS PASSED LIKE MINUTES VEILS GIRDLES AND NECKLACES WERE TRIED ON AND ADMIRED
7113-86041-0049 AND SHOWED SO MUCH TASTE THAT NOBODY
7113-86041-0050 THE GNOME WHO HAD SECRETLY BEEN KEEPING AN EYE UPON THEM WAS VERY PLEASED WITH HIMSELF FOR HAVING SO WELL UNDERSTOOD THE HEART OF A WOMAN AND THE PRINCESS SEEMED TO HIM EVEN MORE CHARMING THAN BEFORE
7113-86041-0051 SHE DID NOT FORGET TO TOUCH THE REST OF THE ROOTS WITH HER MAGIC WAND AND SOON HAD ALL HER MAIDENS ABOUT HER AND EVEN AS SHE HAD TWO TINY RADISHES TO SPARE
7113-86041-0052 WHOSE NAME WAS BENI AND NOW ALL WENT CHEERFULLY IN THE CASTLE THE PRINCESS GAVE TO EACH OF THE MAIDENS HER TASK AND NEVER WAS MISTRESS BETTER SERVED FOR A WHOLE WEEK SHE ENJOYED THE DELIGHT OF HER PLEASANT COMPANY UNDISTURBED
7113-86041-0053 THEY PLAYED FROM MORNING TO NIGHT ONLY THE PRINCESS NOTICED THAT DAY BY DAY THE FRESH YOUNG FACES OF HER MAIDENS GREW PALE AND WAN AND THE MIRROR IN THE GREAT MARBLE HALL SHOWED HER THAT SHE ALONE STILL KEPT HER ROSY BLOOM
7113-86041-0054 WHILE BRUNHILDA AND THE REST FADED VISIBLY THEY ASSURED HER THAT ALL WAS WELL WITH THEM BUT NEVERTHELESS THEY CONTINUED TO WASTE AWAY
7113-86041-0055 TAKE PART IN THE GAMES OF THE PRINCESS TILL AT LAST ONE FINE MORNING WHEN THE PRINCESS STARTED FROM BED AND HASTENED OUT TO JOIN HER GAY PLAYFELLOWS SHE SHUDDERED
7113-86041-0056 AND STARTED BACK AT THE SIGHT OF A GROUP OF SHRIVELLED CRONES WITH BENT BACKS AND TREMBLING LIMBS WHO SUPPORTED THEIR TOTTERING STEPS WITH STAVES AND CRUTCHES AND COUGHED DISMALLY A LITTLE NEARER TO THE HEARTH
7113-86041-0057 LAY THE ONCE FROLICSOME BENI WITH ALL FOUR FEET STRETCHED STIFFLY OUT WHILE THE SLEEK CAT SEEMED TOO WEAK TO RAISE HIS HEAD FROM HIS VELVET CUSHION THE HORRIFIED PRINCESS FLED TO THE DOOR
7113-86041-0058 THE GREATEST DELIGHT OF MY LONELY HOURS ISN'T THIS SOLITARY LIFE IN SUCH A DESERT BAD ENOUGH WITHOUT YOUR TURNING THE CASTLE INTO A HOSPITAL FOR THE AGED GIVE MY MAIDENS BACK THEIR YOUTH AND HEALTH THIS VERY MINUTE OR I WILL NEVER LOVE YOU
7113-86041-0059 SWEETEST AND FAIREST OF DAMSELS CRIED THE GNOME DO NOT BE ANGRY EVERYTHING THAT IS IN MY POWER I WILL DO BUT DO NOT ASK THE IMPOSSIBLE SO LONG AS THE SAP WAS FRESH IN THE ROOTS
7113-86041-0060 THE MAGIC STAFF COULD KEEP THEM IN THE FORMS YOU DESIRED BUT AS THE SAP DRIED UP THEY WITHERED AWAY BUT NEVER TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT THAT DEAREST ONE A BASKET OF FRESH TURNIPS WILL SOON SET MATTERS RIGHT
7113-86041-0061 AND YOU CAN SPEEDILY CALL UP AGAIN EVERY FORM YOU WISH TO SEE THE GREAT GREEN PATCH IN THE GARDEN WILL PROVE YOU WITH A MORE LIVELY COMPANY SO SAYING THE GNOME TOOK HIMSELF OFF
7113-86041-0062 AND THE PRINCESS WITH HER MAGIC WAND TOUCHED THE WRINKLED OLD WOMEN AND LEFT THEM THE WITHERED ROOTS THEY REALLY WERE TO BE THROWN UPON THE RUBBISH HEAP AND WITH LIGHT FEET SKIPPED OFF ACROSS TO THE MEADOW
7113-86041-0063 TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE FRESHLY FILLED BASKET BUT TO HER SURPRISE SHE COULD NOT FIND IT ANYWHERE UP AND DOWN THE GARDEN SHE SEARCHED SPYING INTO EVERY CORNER BUT NOT A SIGN OF IT WAS TO BE FOUND
7113-86041-0064 BY THE TRELLIS OF GRAPE VINES SHE MET THE GNOME WHO WAS SO MUCH EMBARRASSED AT THE SIGHT OF HER THAT SHE BECAME AWARE OF HIS CONFUSION WHILE HE WAS STILL QUITE A LONG WAY OFF
7113-86041-0065 DEAR QUEEN OF MY HEART ANSWERED HE I PRAY YOU TO FORGIVE MY CARELESSNESS I PROMISED MORE THAN I COULD PERFORM I HAVE SOUGHT ALL OVER THE LAND FOR THE ROOTS YOU DESIRE BUT THEY ARE GATHERED IN AND LIE DRYING IN MUSTY CELLARS
7113-86041-0066 AND THE FIELDS ARE BARE AND DESOLATE FOR BELOW IN THE VALLEY WINTER REIGNS ONLY HERE IN YOUR PRESENCE SPRING IS HELD FAST AND WHEREVER YOUR FOOT IS SET THE GAY FLOWERS BLOOM HAVE PATIENCE FOR A LITTLE
7113-86041-0067 AND THEN WITHOUT FAIL YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR PUPPETS TO PLAY WITH ALMOST BEFORE THE GNOME HAD FINISHED THE DISAPPOINTED PRINCESS TURNED AWAY AND MARCHED OFF TO HER OWN APARTMENTS WITHOUT DEIGNING TO ANSWER HIM THE GNOME HOWEVER
7113-86041-0068 AND DISGUISING HIMSELF AS A FARMER BOUGHT AN ASS IN THE NEAREST MARKET TOWN AND BROUGHT IT BACK LOADED WITH SACKS OF TURNIP CARROT AND RADISH SEED WITH THIS HE SOWED A GREAT FIELD
7113-86041-0069 AND SENT A VAST ARMY OF HIS GOBLINS TO WATCH AND TEND IT AND TO BRING UP THE FIERY RIVERS FROM THE HEART OF THE EARTH NEAR ENOUGH TO WARM AND ENCOURAGE THE SPROUTING SEEDS THUS FOSTERED THEY GREW AND FLOURISHED MARVELLOUSLY
7113-86041-0070 HE IMAGINED THAT SHE WAS TOO YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED TO CARE FOR HIM BUT THAT WAS A MISTAKE FOR THE TRUTH WAS THAT ANOTHER IMAGE ALREADY FILLED HER HEART THE YOUNG PRINCE RATIBOR WHOSE LANDS JOINED HER FATHER'S HAD WON THE HEART OF THE PRINCESS
7113-86041-0071 LOOKING FORWARD TO THE COMING OF THEIR WEDDING DAY WHEN THE BRIDE'S MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE TOOK PLACE THE SAD NEWS DROVE RATIBOR DISTRACTED AND AS THE DAYS WENT ON AND NOTHING COULD BE HEARD OF THE PRINCESS HE FORSOOK HIS CASTLE
7113-86041-0072 AND THE SOCIETY OF MEN AND SPENT HIS DAYS IN THE WILD FORESTS ROAMING ABOUT AND CRYING HER NAME ALOUD TO THE TREES AND ROCKS MEANWHILE THE MAIDEN IN HER GORGEOUS PRISON SIGHED IN SECRET OVER HER GRIEF NOT WISHING TO AROUSE THE GNOME'S SUSPICIONS
7113-86041-0073 IN HER OWN MIND SHE WAS WONDERING IF BY ANY MEANS SHE MIGHT ESCAPE FROM HER CAPTIVITY AND AT LAST SHE HIT UPON A PLAN BY THIS TIME SPRING ONCE MORE REIGNED IN THE VALLEY AND THE GNOME SENT THE FIRES BACK TO THEIR PLACES IN THE DEEPS OF THE EARTH
7113-86041-0074 FOR THE ROOTS WHICH THEY HAD KEPT WARM THROUGH ALL THE CRUEL WINTER HAND NOW COME TO THEIR FULL SIZE DAY BY DAY THE PRINCESS PULLED UP SOME OF THEM AND MADE EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM CONJURING UP NOW THIS LONGED FOR PERSON AND NOW THAT
7113-86041-0075 JUST FOR THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THEM AS THEY APPEARED BUT SHE REALLY HAD ANOTHER PURPOSE IN VIEW ONE DAY SHE CHANGED A TINY TURNIP INTO A BEE AND SENT HIM OFF TO BRING HER SOME NEWS OF HER LOVER FLY
7113-86041-0076 SO THE BEE SPREAD HIS SHINING WINGS AND FLEW AWAY TO DO AS HE WAS BIDDEN BUT BEFORE HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT A GREEDY SWALLOW MADE A SNATCH AT HIM AND TO THE GREAT GRIEF OF THE PRINCESS HER MESSENGER WAS EATEN UP
7113-86041-0077 THEN AND THERE AFTER THAT BY THE POWER OF THE WONDERFUL WAND SHE SUMMONED A CRICKET AND TAUGHT HIM THIS GREETING HOP LITTLE CRICKET TO RATIBOR AND CHIRP IN HIS EAR THAT I LOVE HIM ONLY
7113-86041-0078 BUT THAT I AM HELD CAPTIVE BY THE GNOME IN HIS PALACE UNDER THE MOUNTAINS SO THE CRICKET HOPPED OFF GAILY DETERMINED TO DO HIS BEST TO DELIVER HIS MESSAGE BUT ALAS A LONG LEGGED STORK WHO WAS PRANCING ALONG THE SAME ROAD
7113-86041-0079 CAUGHT HIM IN HER CRUEL BEAK AND BEFORE HE COULD SAY A WORD HE HAD DISAPPEARED DOWN HER THROAT THESE TWO UNLUCKY VENTURES DID NOT PREVENT THE PRINCESS FROM TRYING ONCE MORE
7113-86041-0080 THIS TIME SHE CHANGED THE TURNIP INTO A MAGPIE FLUTTER FROM TREE TO TREE CHATTERING BIRD SAID SHE TILL YOU COME TO RATIBOR MY LOVE
7113-86041-0081 AND BID HIM COME WITH HORSES AND MEN THE THIRD DAY FROM THIS TO THE HILL THAT RISES FROM THE THORNY VALLEY THE MAGPIE LISTENED HOPPED AWHILE FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH AND THEN DARTED AWAY
7113-86041-0082 NOW PRINCE RATIBOR WAS STILL SPENDING HIS LIFE IN WANDERING ABOUT THE WOODS AND NOT EVEN THE BEAUTY OF THE SPRING COULD SOOTHE HIS GRIEF ONE DAY AS HE SAT IN THE SHADE OF AN OAK TREE DREAMING OF HIS LOST PRINCESS AND SOMETIMES CRYING HER NAME ALOUD
7113-86041-0083 WHICH BELONGS TO AN UNLUCKY MORTAL WHO WISHES THE EARTH WOULD OPEN AND SWALLOW UP HIM AND HIS MEMORY FOR EVER THEREUPON HE CAUGHT UP A GREAT STONE
7113-86041-0084 BUT THE MAGPIE IN THE TREE WHO LIKE
7113-86041-0085 UNLESS HE COULD BE FOR EVER CHATTERING
7113-86041-0086 ALL HIS GLOOM AND MISERY VANISHED IN A MOMENT AND HE ANXIOUSLY QUESTIONED THE WELCOME MESSENGER AS TO THE FATE OF THE PRINCESS BUT THE MAGPIE KNEW NO MORE THAN THE LESSON HE HAD LEARNT SO HE SOON FLUTTERED AWAY
7113-86041-0087 WHILE THE PRINCE HURRIED BACK TO HIS CASTLE TO GATHER TOGETHER A TROOP OF HORSEMEN FULL OF COURAGE FOR WHATEVER MIGHT BEFALL THE PRINCESS MEANWHILE WAS CRAFTILY PURSUING HER PLAN OF ESCAPE
7113-86041-0088 SHE LEFT OFF TREATING THE GNOME WITH COLDNESS AND INDIFFERENCE INDEED THERE WAS A LOOK IN HER EYES WHICH ENCOURAGED HIM TO HOPE THAT SHE MIGHT SOME DAY RETURN HIS LOVE AND THE IDEA PLEASED HIM MIGHTILY THE NEXT DAY
7113-86041-0089 AS SOON AS THE SUN ROSE SHE MADE HER APPEARANCE DECKED AS A BRIDE IN THE WONDERFUL ROBES AND JEWELS WHICH THE FOND GNOME HAD PREPARED FOR HER HER GOLDEN HAIR WAS BRAIDED AND CROWNED WITH MYRTLE BLOSSOMS
7113-86041-0090 AND HER FLOWING VEIL SPARKLED WITH GEMS IN THESE MAGNIFICENT GARMENTS SHE WENT TO MEET THE GNOME UPON THE GREAT TERRACE LOVELIEST OF MAIDENS HE STAMMERED BOWING LOW BEFORE HER LET ME GAZE INTO YOUR DEAR EYES
7113-86041-0091 YOUR CONSTANCY HAS OVERCOME ME SHE SAID I CAN NO LONGER OPPOSE YOUR WISHES BUT BELIEVE MY WORDS AND SUFFER THIS VEIL STILL TO HIDE MY BLUSHES AND TEARS WHY TEARS BELOVED ONE CRIED THE GNOME ANXIOUSLY
7113-86041-0092 EVERY TEAR OF YOURS FALLS UPON MY HEART LIKE A DROP OF MOLTEN GOLD GREATLY AS I DESIRE YOUR LOVE I DO NOT ASK A SACRIFICE AH CRIED THE FALSE PRINCESS WHY DO YOU MISUNDERSTAND MY TEARS
7113-86041-0093 AND YET I AM FEARFUL A WIFE CANNOT ALWAYS CHARM AND THOUGH YOU WILL NEVER ALTER THE BEAUTY OF MORTALS IS AS A FLOWER THAT FADES HOW CAN I BE SURE THAT YOU WILL ALWAYS BE AS LOVING AND CHARMING AS YOU ARE NOW
7113-86041-0094 ASK SOME PROOF SWEETHEART SAID HE PUT MY OBEDIENCE AND MY PATIENCE TO SOME TEST BY WHICH YOU CAN JUDGE OF MY UNALTERABLE LOVE BE IT SO ANSWERED THE CRAFTY MAIDEN THEN GIVE ME
7113-86041-0095 THAT SHALL BE THE TEST OF YOUR TRUTH TOWARDS ME UNWILLING AS THE GNOME WAS TO LOSE SIGHT OF HIS BEAUTIFUL BRIDE FOR A MOMENT HE OBEYED HER COMMANDS WITHOUT DELAY AND HURRIED OFF TO BEGIN HIS TASK
7113-86041-0096 HE SKIPPED ALONG AMONG THE TURNIPS AS NIMBLE AS A GRASSHOPPER AND HAD SOON COUNTED THEM ALL BUT TO BE QUITE CERTAIN THAT HE HAD MADE NO MISTAKE HE THOUGHT HE WOULD JUST RUN OVER THEM AGAIN
7113-86041-0097 THIS TIME TO HIS GREAT ANNOYANCE THE NUMBER WAS DIFFERENT SO HE RECKONED THEM FOR THE THIRD TIME BUT NOW THE NUMBER WAS NOT THE SAME AS EITHER OF THE PREVIOUS ONES AND THIS WAS HARDLY TO BE WONDERED AT AS HIS MIND WAS FULL OF THE PRINCESS'S
7113-86041-0098 PRETTY LOOKS AND WORDS AS FOR THE MAIDEN NO SOONER WAS HER DELUDED LOVER FAIRLY OUT OF SIGHT THAN SHE BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR FLIGHT SHE HAD A FINE FRESH TURNIP HIDDEN CLOSE AT HAND
7113-86041-0099 WHICH SHE CHANGED INTO A SPIRITED HORSE ALL SADDLED AND BRIDLED AND SPRINGING UPON ITS BACK SHE GALLOPED AWAY OVER HILL AND DALE TILL SHE REACHED THE THORNY VALLEY AND FLUNG HERSELF
7113-86041-0100 INTO THE ARMS OF HER BELOVED PRINCE RATIBOR MEANWHILE THE TOILING GNOME WENT THROUGH HIS TASK OVER AND OVER AGAIN TILL HIS BACK ACHED AND HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE COULD NO LONGER PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER
7113-86041-0101 BUT AS HE FELT TOLERABLY CERTAIN OF THE EXACT NUMBER OF TURNIPS IN THE FIELD BIG AND LITTLE TOGETHER HE HURRIED BACK EAGER TO PROVE TO HIS BELOVED ONE WHAT A DELIGHTFUL AND SUBMISSIVE HUSBAND HE WOULD BE HE FELT VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH HIMSELF
7113-86041-0102 AS HE CROSSED THE MOSSY LAWN TO THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD LEFT HER BUT ALAS SHE WAS NO LONGER THERE HE SEARCHED EVERY THICKET AND PATH HE LOOKED BEHIND EVERY TREE AND GAZED INTO EVERY POND
7113-86041-0103 BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS THEN HE HASTENED INTO THE PALACE AND RUSHED FROM ROOM TO ROOM PEERING INTO EVERY HOLE AND CORNER AND CALLING HER BY NAME BUT ONLY
7113-86041-0104 ECHO ANSWERED IN THE MARBLE HALLS THERE WAS NEITHER VOICE NOR FOOTSTEP THEN HE BEGAN TO PERCEIVE THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS AND THROWING OFF THE MORTAL FORM THAT ENCUMBERED HIM HE FLEW OUT OF THE PALACE
7113-86041-0105 AND SOARED HIGH INTO THE AIR AND SAW THE FUGITIVE PRINCESS IN THE FAR DISTANCE JUST AS THE SWIFT HORSE CARRIED HER ACROSS THE BOUNDARY OF HIS DOMINIONS FURIOUSLY
7113-86041-0106 AND HURL A THUNDERBOLT AFTER THE FLYING MAIDEN SPLINTERING THE ROCKY BARRIERS WHICH HAD STOOD A THOUSAND YEARS BUT HIS FURY WAS VAIN THE THUNDERCLOUDS MELTED AWAY INTO A SOFT MIST
7113-86041-0107 AND THE GNOME AFTER FLYING ABOUT FOR A WHILE IN DESPAIR BEWAILING TO THE FOUR WINDS HIS UNHAPPY FATE WENT SORROWFULLY BACK TO THE PALACE AND STOLE ONCE MORE THROUGH EVERY ROOM WITH MANY SIGHS AND LAMENTATIONS
7113-86041-0108 HE PASSED THROUGH THE GARDENS WHICH FOR HIM HAD LOST THEIR CHARM AND THE SIGHT OF THE PRINCESS'S FOOTPRINTS ON THE GOLDEN SAND OF THE PATHWAY RENEWED HIS GRIEF ALL WAS LONELY EMPTY SORROWFUL
7113-86041-0109 AND THE FORSAKEN GNOME RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD HAVE NO MORE DEALINGS WITH SUCH FALSE CREATURES
7113-86041-0110 TO THE DEPTHS OF HIS UNDERGROUND KINGDOM
7178-34644-0000 THE DURABILITY OF FRAGILE THINGS DESTINY SOMETIMES PROFFERS US A GLASS OF MADNESS TO DRINK A HAND IS THRUST OUT OF THE MIST AND SUDDENLY HANDS US THE MYSTERIOUS CUP IN WHICH IS CONTAINED THE LATENT INTOXICATION
7178-34644-0001 GWYNPLAINE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HE LOOKED BEHIND HIM TO SEE WHO IT WAS WHO HAD BEEN ADDRESSED A SOUND MAY BE TOO SHARP TO BE PERCEPTIBLE TO THE EAR
7178-34644-0002 AN EMOTION TOO ACUTE CONVEYS NO MEANING TO THE MIND THERE IS A LIMIT TO COMPREHENSION AS WELL AS TO HEARING THE WAPENTAKE AND THE JUSTICE OF THE QUORUM APPROACHED GWYNPLAINE AND TOOK HIM BY THE ARMS
7178-34644-0003 HE FELT HIMSELF PLACED IN THE CHAIR WHICH THE SHERIFF HAD JUST VACATED HE LET IT BE DONE WITHOUT SEEKING AN EXPLANATION WHEN GWYNPLAINE WAS SEATED THE JUSTICE OF THE QUORUM AND THE WAPENTAKE RETIRED A FEW STEPS
7178-34644-0004 AND STOOD UPRIGHT AND MOTIONLESS BEHIND THE SEAT THEN THE SHERIFF PLACED HIS BUNCH OF ROSES ON THE STONE TABLE PUT ON SPECTACLES WHICH THE SECRETARY GAVE HIM DREW FROM THE BUNDLES OF PAPERS WHICH COVERED THE TABLE A SHEET OF PARCHMENT
7178-34644-0005 YELLOW GREEN TORN AND JAGGED IN PLACES WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN FOLDED IN VERY SMALL FOLDS AND OF WHICH ONE SIDE WAS COVERED WITH WRITING STANDING UNDER THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP HE HELD THE SHEET CLOSE TO HIS EYES
7178-34644-0006 AND IN HIS MOST SOLEMN TONE READ AS FOLLOWS IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER THE SON AND THE HOLY GHOST THIS PRESENT DAY THE TWENTY NINTH OF JANUARY ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND NINETIETH YEAR OF OUR LORD
7178-34644-0007 HAS BEEN WICKEDLY DESERTED ON THE DESERT COAST OF PORTLAND WITH THE INTENTION OF ALLOWING HIM TO PERISH OF HUNGER OF COLD AND OF SOLITUDE A CHILD TEN YEARS OLD
7178-34644-0008 THAT CHILD WAS SOLD AT THE AGE OF TWO YEARS BY ORDER OF HIS MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY KING JAMES THE SECOND THAT CHILD IS LORD FERMAIN CLANCHARLIE
7178-34644-0009 THE ONLY LEGITIMATE SON OF LORD LINNAEUS CLANCHARLIE BARON CLANCHARLIE AND HUNKERVILLE MARQUIS OF CORLEONE IN SICILY A PEER OF ENGLAND AND OF ANN BRADSHAW HIS WIFE BOTH DECEASED
7178-34644-0010 THAT CHILD IS THE INHERITOR OF THE ESTATES AND TITLES OF HIS FATHER FOR THIS REASON HE WAS SOLD MUTILATED DISFIGURED AND PUT OUT OF THE WAY BY DESIRE OF HIS MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY
7178-34644-0011 THAT CHILD WAS BROUGHT UP AND TRAINED TO BE A MOUNTEBANK AT MARKETS AND FAIRS HE WAS SOLD AT THE AGE OF TWO AFTER THE DEATH OF THE PEER HIS FATHER AND TEN POUNDS STERLING WERE GIVEN TO THE KING AS HIS PURCHASE MONEY

7178-34644-0013 AND DISFIGURED BY A FLEMING OF FLANDERS CALLED HARDQUANONNE WHO ALONE IS ACQUAINTED WITH THE SECRETS AND MODES OF TREATMENT OF DOCTOR CONQUEST THE CHILD WAS DESTINED BY US TO BE A LAUGHING MASK
7178-34644-0014 WHICH STAMPS AN EVERLASTING LAUGH UPON THE FACE THE CHILD BY MEANS KNOWN ONLY TO HARDQUANONNE WAS PUT TO SLEEP AND MADE INSENSIBLE DURING ITS PERFORMANCE KNOWING NOTHING OF THE OPERATION WHICH HE UNDERWENT
7178-34644-0015 HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT HE IS LORD CLANCHARLIE HE ANSWERS TO THE NAME OF GWYNPLAINE THIS FACT IS THE RESULT OF HIS YOUTH AND THE SLIGHT POWERS OF MEMORY HE COULD HAVE HAD WHEN HE WAS BOUGHT AND SOLD
7178-34644-0016 BEING THEN BARELY TWO YEARS OLD HARDQUANONNE IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO KNOWS HOW TO PERFORM THE OPERATION BUCCA FISSA AND THE SAID CHILD IS THE ONLY LIVING SUBJECT UPON WHICH IT HAS BEEN ESSAYED
7178-34644-0017 THE OPERATION IS SO UNIQUE AND SINGULAR THAT THOUGH AFTER LONG YEARS THIS CHILD SHOULD HAVE COME TO BE AN OLD MAN INSTEAD OF A CHILD AND HIS BLACK LOCKS SHOULD HAVE TURNED WHITE

7178-34644-0021 THE UNDERSIGNED BROUGHT UP AND KEPT FOR EIGHT YEARS FOR PROFESSIONAL PURPOSES THE LITTLE LORD BOUGHT BY US OF THE KING TO DAY FLYING FROM ENGLAND TO AVOID HARDQUANONNE'S ILL FORTUNE
7178-34644-0022 OUR FEAR OF THE PENAL INDICTMENTS PROHIBITIONS AND FULMINATIONS OF PARLIAMENT HAS INDUCED US TO DESERT AT NIGHT FALL ON THE COAST OF PORTLAND THE SAID CHILD GWYNPLAINE WHO IS LORD FERMAIN CLANCHARLIE

7178-34644-0060 THE SHERIFF HOLDING IN HIS LEFT HAND THE NOSEGAY AND IN HIS RIGHT THE WHITE WAND PLACED HIMSELF OPPOSITE GWYNPLAINE WHO WAS STILL SEATED AND MADE HIM A LOW BOW THEN ASSUMING ANOTHER SOLEMN ATTITUDE

7178-34644-0068 REPEATED HIS SALUTATION STILL MORE RESPECTFULLY AND BOWED TO THE GROUND BEFORE GWYNPLAINE AH SAID GWYNPLAINE AWAKE ME AND HE STOOD UP PALE AS DEATH
7178-34644-0069 IT WAS CLEAR THAT THIS MAN HAD BEEN THERE IN THE SHADOW BEFORE GWYNPLAINE HAD ENTERED THAT HE HAD A REGULAR RIGHT OF ATTENDANCE
7178-34644-0070 THE MAN WAS FAT AND PURSY AND WORE A COURT WIG AND A TRAVELLING CLOAK HE WAS RATHER OLD THAN YOUNG AND VERY PRECISE HE SALUTED GWYNPLAINE WITH EASE AND RESPECT
7178-34644-0071 WITH THE EASE OF A GENTLEMAN IN WAITING AND WITHOUT THE AWKWARDNESS OF A JUDGE YES HE SAID I HAVE COME TO AWAKEN YOU FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS YOU HAVE SLEPT YOU HAVE BEEN DREAMING
7178-34644-0072 IT IS TIME TO AWAKE YOU BELIEVE YOURSELF TO BE GWYNPLAINE YOU ARE CLANCHARLIE YOU BELIEVE YOURSELF TO BE ONE OF THE PEOPLE YOU BELONG TO THE PEERAGE
7178-34644-0073 SAID THE FAT MAN THAT I AM CALLED BARKILPHEDRO THAT I AM AN OFFICER OF THE ADMIRALTY THAT THIS WAIF THE FLASK OF HARDQUANONNE WAS FOUND ON THE BEACH AND WAS BROUGHT TO BE UNSEALED BY ME
7178-34644-0074 AND BY ORDER OF THE QUEEN ALL NECESSARY AND LEGAL FORMALITIES WERE CARRIED OUT WITH THE DISCRETION NECESSARY IN A MATTER SO DELICATE THAT THE LAST FORM THE CONFRONTATION HAS JUST BEEN CARRIED OUT
7178-34644-0075 A LEGISLATOR AND A JUDGE A SUPREME JUDGE A SOVEREIGN LEGISLATOR DRESSED IN PURPLE AND ERMINE EQUAL TO PRINCES LIKE UNTO EMPERORS THAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR BROW THE CORONET OF A PEER
7178-34645-0000 PICKED UP ON THE SAND AT LOW WATER A FLASK COVERED WITH WICKER WHICH HAD BEEN CAST UP BY THE TIDE THIS FLASK COVERED WITH MOULD WAS CORKED BY A TARRED BUNG THE SOLDIER CARRIED THE WAIF TO THE COLONEL OF THE CASTLE

7178-34645-0002 CARRIED IT TO THE QUEEN THE QUEEN IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE MATTER INTO CONSIDERATION TWO WEIGHTY COUNSELLORS WERE INSTRUCTED AND CONSULTED NAMELY THE LORD CHANCELLOR
7178-34645-0003 WE MUST NOT CONFOUND THIS CHANCELLOR WITH HIS NAMESAKE AND CONTEMPORARY WILLIAM COWPER THE ANATOMIST AND COMMENTATOR ON BIDLOO WHO PUBLISHED A TREATISE ON MUSCLES IN ENGLAND
7178-34645-0004 A SURGEON IS A VERY DIFFERENT THING FROM A LORD LORD WILLIAM COWPER IS CELEBRATED FOR HAVING WITH REFERENCE TO THE AFFAIR OF TALBOT YELVERTON VISCOUNT LONGUEVILLE PROPOUNDED THIS OPINION
7178-34645-0005 THAT IN THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION THE RESTORATION OF A PEER IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE RESTORATION OF A KING
7178-34645-0006 THE AUTHOR OF A MAXIM DELIGHTS IN OPPORTUNITIES TO WHICH IT MAY BE APPLIED HERE WAS A CASE OF THE RESTORATION OF A PEER SEARCH WAS MADE GWYNPLAINE BY THE INSCRIPTION OVER HIS DOOR
7178-34645-0007 WAS SOON FOUND NEITHER WAS HARDQUANONNE DEAD A PRISON ROTS A MAN BUT PRESERVES HIM IF TO KEEP IS TO PRESERVE
7178-34645-0008 HARDQUANONNE WAS STILL IN PRISON AT CHATHAM THEY HAD ONLY TO PUT THEIR HANDS ON HIM HE WAS TRANSFERRED FROM CHATHAM TO LONDON IN THE MEANTIME INFORMATION WAS SOUGHT IN SWITZERLAND
7178-34645-0009 THE FACTS WERE FOUND TO BE CORRECT THEY OBTAINED FROM THE LOCAL ARCHIVES AT VEVEY AT LAUSANNE THE CERTIFICATE OF LORD LINNAEUS'S MARRIAGE IN EXILE THE CERTIFICATE OF HIS CHILD'S BIRTH THE CERTIFICATE OF THE DECEASE OF THE FATHER AND MOTHER
7178-34645-0010 AND WITH THAT MOLE LIKE SILENCE RECOMMENDED AND PRACTISED BY BACON AND LATER ON MADE LAW BY BLACKSTONE FOR AFFAIRS CONNECTED WITH THE CHANCELLORSHIP AND THE STATE AND IN MATTERS TERMED PARLIAMENTARY
7178-34645-0011 TO THOSE WHO HAVE STUDIED PATHOLOGICALLY THE CASES OF CAPRICE CALLED OUR GOOD WILL AND PLEASURE
7178-34645-0012 WHOSE CREDIT REQUIRED THE CONCEALMENT OF SUCH ACTS HAVE ALLOWED THAT TO BE WRITTEN WHICH ENDANGERED THEIR SUCCESS THE ANSWER IS CYNICISM HAUGHTY INDIFFERENCE OH
7178-34645-0013 YOU BELIEVE THAT EFFRONTERY IS CONFINED TO ABANDONED WOMEN
7178-34645-0014 OFTEN WHEN IT WOULD BE TO A MAN'S GREATEST ADVANTAGE TO ESCAPE FROM THE HANDS OF THE POLICE OR THE RECORDS OF HISTORY
7178-34645-0015 LOOK AT MY ARM OBSERVE THE DESIGN I AM LACENAIRE SEE A TEMPLE OF LOVE AND A BURNING HEART PIERCED THROUGH WITH AN ARROW
7178-34645-0016 JAMES THE SECOND A MAN COMMITS A BAD ACTION AND PLACES HIS MARK UPON IT TO FILL UP THE MEASURE OF CRIME BY EFFRONTERY TO DENOUNCE HIMSELF TO CLING TO HIS MISDEEDS IS THE INSOLENT BRAVADO OF THE CRIMINAL
7178-34645-0017 CHRISTINA SEIZED MONALDESCHI HAD HIM CONFESSED AND ASSASSINATED AND SAID I AM THE QUEEN OF SWEDEN IN THE PALACE OF THE KING OF FRANCE
7178-34645-0018 THERE IS THE TYRANT WHO CONCEALS HIMSELF LIKE TIBERIUS AND THE TYRANT WHO DISPLAYS HIMSELF
7178-34645-0019 HE HAD WE KNOW A GAY AND OPEN COUNTENANCE DIFFERING SO FAR FROM PHILIP PHILIP WAS SULLEN JAMES JOVIAL BOTH WERE EQUALLY FEROCIOUS
7178-34645-0020 HIS CRIMES LAY LIGHT UPON HIS CONSCIENCE HE WAS A MONSTER BY THE GRACE OF GOD THEREFORE HE HAD NOTHING TO DISSIMULATE NOR TO EXTENUATE AND HIS ASSASSINATIONS WERE BY DIVINE RIGHT
7178-34645-0021 HE TOO WOULD NOT HAVE MINDED LEAVING BEHIND HIM THOSE ARCHIVES OF SIMANCAS WITH ALL HIS MISDEEDS DATED CLASSIFIED LABELLED AND PUT IN ORDER EACH IN ITS COMPARTMENT LIKE POISONS IN THE CABINET OF A CHEMIST
7178-34645-0022 TO SET THE SIGN MANUAL TO CRIMES IS RIGHT ROYAL EVERY DEED DONE IS A DRAFT DRAWN ON THE GREAT INVISIBLE PAYMASTER A BILL HAD JUST COME DUE WITH THE OMINOUS ENDORSEMENT
7178-34645-0023 JUSSU REGIS QUEEN ANNE IN ONE PARTICULAR UNFEMININE SEEING THAT SHE COULD KEEP A SECRET DEMANDED A CONFIDENTIAL REPORT OF SO GRAVE A MATTER FROM THE LORD CHANCELLOR
7178-34645-0024 ONE OF THE KIND SPECIFIED AS REPORT TO THE ROYAL EAR REPORTS OF THIS KIND HAVE BEEN COMMON IN ALL MONARCHIES AT VIENNA THERE WAS A COUNSELLOR OF THE EAR AN AULIC DIGNITARY
7178-34645-0025 IT WAS AN ANCIENT CARLOVINGIAN OFFICE THE AURICULARIUS OF THE OLD PALATINE DEEDS HE WHO WHISPERS TO THE EMPEROR WILLIAM BARON COWPER CHANCELLOR OF ENGLAND
7178-34645-0026 WHOM THE QUEEN BELIEVED IN BECAUSE HE WAS SHORT SIGHTED LIKE HERSELF OR EVEN MORE SO HAD COMMITTED TO WRITING A MEMORANDUM COMMENCING THUS TWO BIRDS WERE SUBJECT TO SOLOMON A LAPWING THE HUDBUD
7178-34645-0027 THE LORD CHANCELLOR PROVED THE FACT THAT THE HEIR TO A PEERAGE HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF MUTILATED AND THEN RESTORED
7178-34645-0028 THE QUEEN'S FATHER HE EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO JUSTIFY HIM FIRST THERE ARE ANCIENT MONARCHICAL MAXIMS E SENIORATU ERIPIMUS IN ROTURAGIO CADAT
7178-34645-0029 SECONDLY THERE IS A ROYAL RIGHT OF MUTILATION
7178-34645-0030 THE EYES OF DUKES OF THE BLOOD ROYAL HAVE BEEN PLUCKED OUT FOR THE GOOD OF THE KINGDOM CERTAIN PRINCES TOO NEAR TO THE THRONE HAVE BEEN CONVENIENTLY STIFLED BETWEEN MATTRESSES
7178-34645-0031 AND HIS AMBASSADORS HAVE NOT BEEN THE LESS FAVOURABLY RECEIVED BY THE EMPEROR HENCE THE KING MAY ORDER THE SUPPRESSION OF A LIMB LIKE THE SUPPRESSION OF A STATE ET CETERA IT IS LEGAL BUT ONE LAW DOES NOT DESTROY ANOTHER
7178-34645-0032 IF A DROWNED MAN IS CAST UP BY THE WATER AND IS NOT DEAD IT IS AN ACT OF GOD READJUSTING ONE OF THE KING IF THE HEIR BE FOUND LET THE CORONET BE GIVEN BACK TO HIM
7178-34645-0033 THUS SHOULD BE DONE TO GWYNPLAINE WHO IS ALSO A KING SEEING THAT HE IS A PEER
7178-34645-0034 UNDER CONSTRAINT OF SUPERIOR POWER DOES NOT TARNISH THE BLAZON AS IN THE CASE OF ABDOLMUMEN WHO WAS A KING ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN A GARDENER THAT OF JOSEPH WHO WAS A SAINT ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN A CARPENTER
7178-34645-0035 THAT OF APOLLO WHO WAS A GOD ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN A SHEPHERD IN SHORT THE LEARNED CHANCELLOR CONCLUDED BY ADVISING THE REINSTATEMENT IN ALL HIS ESTATES AND DIGNITIES OF LORD FERMAIN CLANCHARLIE
7178-34645-0036 MISCALLED GWYNPLAINE ON THE SOLE CONDITION THAT HE SHOULD BE CONFRONTED WITH THE CRIMINAL HARDQUANONNE AND IDENTIFIED BY THE SAME AND ON THIS POINT THE CHANCELLOR AS CONSTITUTIONAL KEEPER OF THE ROYAL CONSCIENCE
7178-34645-0037 BASED THE ROYAL DECISION THE LORD CHANCELLOR ADDED IN A POSTSCRIPT
7178-34645-0038 FOR IF THE PRISONER DIES ON THE SECOND OR THIRD DAY THE CONFRONTATION BECOMES DIFFICULT STILL THE LAW MUST BE OBEYED
7190-90542-0000 THE IDENTITY OF THE FINAL VICTIM
7190-90542-0001 AS AN EXCUSE I TALKED OVER CASES WITH HIM BUT HE SELDOM VOLUNTEERED AN OPINION OFTEN WAS OBVIOUSLY UNINTERESTED TRUTH TO TELL I WAS NOT THERE FOR HIS OPINION BUT TO SEE HIS GRANDDAUGHTER A DETECTIVE IN LOVE SOUNDS SOMETHING LIKE AN ABSURDITY
7190-90542-0002 BUT SUCH WAS MY CASE AND SINCE ZENA'S MANNER DID NOT SUGGEST THAT SHE WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN ME MY LOVE AFFAIR SEEMED RATHER A HOPELESS ONE MY ASSOCIATION WITH CHRISTOPHER QUARLES HAS HOWEVER
7190-90542-0003 LED TO THE SOLUTION OF SOME STRANGE MYSTERIES AND SINCE MY OWN ACHIEVEMENTS ARE SUFFICIENTLY WELL KNOWN I MAY CONFINE MYSELF TO THOSE CASES WHICH SINGLE HANDED I SHOULD HAVE FAILED TO SOLVE I KNOW THAT IN MANY OF THEM I WAS CREDITED WITH HAVING UNRAVELED THE MYSTERY
7190-90542-0004 BUT THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE PROFESSOR QUARLES PERSISTED IN REMAINING IN THE BACKGROUND IF I DID THE SPADE WORK THE DEDUCTIONS WERE HIS THEY WERE ALL CASES WITH PECULIAR FEATURES IN THEM
7190-90542-0005 HE WAS OFTEN AS ASTONISHED AT MY ACUMEN IN FOLLOWING A CLEW AS I WAS AT HIS MARVELOUS THEORIES
7190-90542-0006 PERHAPS HIS CURIOUS POWER WAS NEVER MORE NOTICEABLE THAN IN THE CASE OF THE WITHAN MURDER A FARMER RETURNING FROM MEDWORTH THE NEIGHBORING MARKET TOWN ONE NIGHT IN JANUARY
7190-90542-0007 BY EVENING THE CLOUDS HAD GONE THE MOON SAILED IN A CLEAR SKY AND LOOKING ROUND TO FIND THE CAUSE OF HIS HORSE'S UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR THE FARMER SAW A MAN LYING ON A HEAP OF SNOW UNDER THE OPPOSITE HEDGE HE WAS DEAD MORE HE WAS HEADLESS
7190-90542-0008 IT WAS NOT UNTIL SOME DAYS LATER THAT THE CASE CAME INTO MY HANDS AND IN THE INTERVAL THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAD NOT BEEN IDLE IT WAS NOTED THAT THE MAN WAS POORLY DRESSED THAT HIS HANDS PROVED HE WAS USED TO MANUAL LABOR BUT THERE WAS NO MARK EITHER ON HIS BODY OR ON HIS CLOTHING
7190-90542-0009 NOR ANY PAPERS IN HIS POCKETS TO LEAD TO HIS IDENTIFICATION SO FAR AS COULD BE ASCERTAINED
7190-90542-0010 AND APPARENTLY NO STRUGGLE HAD TAKEN PLACE FOOTPRINTS NEARLY OBLITERATED
7190-90542-0011 SOON AFTER THE STORM BEGAN AND THAT SNOW HAD HIDDEN THE MURDERER'S TRACKS FROM THE WOOD THAT SNOW HAD DRIFTED ON TO THE DEAD BODY SEEMED TO ESTABLISH THIS THEORY
7190-90542-0012 AND WOULD BE FOUND BURIED IN THE WOOD IT WAS NOT FOUND HOWEVER AND THE COUNTRYSIDE WAS IN A STATE BORDERING ON PANIC FOR A FEW DAYS THE WITHAN MURDER SEEMED UNIQUE IN ATROCITIES AND THEN CAME A COMMUNICATION FROM THE FRENCH POLICE
7190-90542-0013 SOME TWO YEARS AGO AN ALMOST IDENTICAL MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED OUTSIDE A VILLAGE IN NORMANDY IN THIS CASE ALSO THE HEAD WAS MISSING AND NOTHING HAD BEEN FOUND UPON THE BODY TO IDENTIFY THE VICTIM HE WAS WELL DRESSED AND A MAN WHO WOULD BE LIKELY TO CARRY PAPERS WITH HIM BUT NOTHING WAS FOUND
7190-90542-0014 AND THE MURDER HAD REMAINED A MYSTERY THESE WERE THE POINTS KNOWN AND CONJECTURED WHEN THE CASE CAME INTO MY HANDS AND MY INVESTIGATIONS ADDED LITTLE TO THEM ONE POINT HOWEVER IMPRESSED ME I FELT CONVINCED THAT THE MAN'S CLOTHES WHICH WERE SHOWN TO ME HAD NOT BEEN MADE IN ENGLAND
7190-90542-0015 THEY WERE POOR WORN ALMOST THREADBARE BUT THEY HAD ONCE BEEN FAIRLY GOOD AND THE CUT WAS NOT ENGLISH THAT IT WAS FRENCH I COULD NOT POSSIBLY AFFIRM BUT IT MIGHT BE AND SO I FASHIONED A FRAGILE LINK WITH THE NORMANDY CRIME
7190-90542-0016 ON THIS OCCASION I WENT TO QUARLES WITH THE OBJECT OF INTERESTING HIM IN THE WITHAN CASE AND HE FORESTALLED ME BY BEGINNING TO TALK ABOUT IT THE MOMENT I ENTERED THE ROOM HERE I MAY MENTION A FACT WHICH I HAD NOT DISCOVERED AT FIRST
7190-90542-0017 WHENEVER HE WAS INTERESTED IN A CASE I WAS ALWAYS TAKEN INTO HIS EMPTY ROOM AT OTHER TIMES WE WERE IN THE DINING ROOM OR THE DRAWING ROOM IT WAS THE EMPTY ROOM ON THIS OCCASION AND ZENA REMAINED WITH US
7190-90542-0018 THE FOREIGN CUT OF THE CLOTHES MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE HE SAID I AM NOT SURE IS THIS WOOD YOU MENTION OF ANY GREAT EXTENT NO IT RUNS BESIDE THE ROAD FOR TWO OR THREE HUNDRED YARDS TOWARD WITHAN NO IT WAS NEAR THE WITHAN END OF IT THAT THE DEAD MAN WAS FOUND
7190-90542-0019 ANY TRACES THAT THE HEAD WAS CARRIED TO THE WOOD THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES SAY YES AND NOT A TRACE AFTERWARD THE GROUND IN THE WOOD WAS SEARCHED AT THE TIME AND I HAVE BEEN OVER IT CAREFULLY SINCE THROUGH ONE PART OF THE WOOD THERE RUNS A DITCH
7190-90542-0020 WHICH IS CONTINUED AS A DIVISION BETWEEN TWO FIELDS WHICH FORM PART OF THE FARM LAND BEHIND THE WOOD BY WALKING ALONG THIS THE MURDERER MIGHT HAVE LEFT THE WOOD WITHOUT LEAVING TRACKS BEHIND HIM A GOOD POINT WIGAN AND WHERE WOULD THAT DITCH LEAD HIM EVENTUALLY TO THE HIGH ROAD
7190-90542-0021 WHICH RUNS ALMOST AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE WITHAN ROAD MUCH WATER IN THE DITCH ASKED QUARLES HALF A FOOT WHEN I WENT THERE
7190-90542-0022 THERE WAS A MOON THAT NIGHT WASN'T THERE FULL OR NEAR IT I RETURNED AND HOW SOON WAS THE ALARM RAISED ALONG THE COUNTRYSIDE
7190-90542-0023 AND AFTER GOING TO THE VILLAGE THE FARMER RETURNED TO MEDWORTH FOR THE POLICE
7190-90542-0024 SAID ZENA AND IF HE WERE MET ON THE ROAD CARRYING A BAG HE WOULD ARREST ATTENTION WHY CARRYING A BAG ASKED QUARLES WITH THE HEAD IN IT SHE ANSWERED THAT'S ANOTHER GOOD POINT WIGAN CHUCKLED QUARLES OF COURSE
7190-90542-0025 THE HEAD MAY BE BURIED IN THE WOOD SAID ZENA QUARLES LOOKED AT ME INQUIRINGLY
7190-90542-0026 ONE OR TWO DOUBTFUL PLACES I HAD DUG UP I THINK THE MURDERER MUST HAVE TAKEN THE HEAD WITH HIM TO BURY SOMEWHERE ELSE ASKED QUARLES
7190-90542-0027 A MAD DOCTOR BENT ON BRAIN EXPERIMENTS IS THAT YOUR THEORY WIGAN
7190-90542-0028 JANUARY THE SEVENTEENTH NEARLY THE SAME DATE AS THE ENGLISH ONE SAID ZENA TWO YEARS INTERVENING I RETURNED
7190-90542-0029 AT THAT DATE SAID QUARLES YOU HAVE A THEORY PROFESSOR AN OUTLANDISH ONE WHICH WOULD MAKE YOU LAUGH NO NO I DO NOT LIKE BEING LAUGHED AT I NEVER MENTION MY THEORIES UNTIL I HAVE SOME FACTS TO SUPPORT THEM
7190-90542-0030 I TOOK THE TROUBLE TO MAKE INQUIRY WHETHER ANY SIMILAR CRIME HAD HAPPENED IN ENGLAND IN THE JANUARY OF THE PRECEDING YEAR AND HAD THE SAME INQUIRY MADE IN FRANCE THERE WAS NO RECORD OF ANY MURDER BEARING THE SLIGHTEST RESEMBLANCE TO THE WITHAN TRAGEDY
7190-90542-0031 A FEW DAYS LATER QUARLES TELEGRAPHED ME TO MEET HIM AT KINGS CROSS AND WE TRAVELED NORTH TOGETHER WAIT HE SAID WHEN I BEGAN TO QUESTION HIM I AM NOT SURE YET MY THEORY SEEMS ABSURD WE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT IF IT IS
7190-90542-0032 WE TOOK ROOMS AT A HOTEL IN MEDWORTH QUARLES EXPLAINING THAT OUR INVESTIGATIONS MIGHT TAKE SOME DAYS NEXT MORNING INSTEAD OF GOING TO WITHAN AS I HAD EXPECTED HE TOOK ME TO THE POLICE COURT
7190-90542-0033 THE NEXT AFTERNOON HE ARRANGED A DRIVE I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO WITHAN BUT WE TURNED AWAY FROM THE VILLAGE AND PRESENTLY QUARLES STOPPED THE CARRIAGE
7190-90542-0034 FIVE OR SIX MILES THE ROAD WINDS A LOT IT'S A DEAL NEARER AS THE CROW FLIES YOU NEED NOT WAIT FOR US DRIVER MY FRIEND AND I ARE GOING TO WALK BACK THE COACHMAN POCKETED HIS MONEY AND DROVE AWAY COULDN'T KEEP HIM WAITING ALL NIGHT AS WE MAY HAVE TO DO
7190-90542-0035 SAID QUARLES MIND YOU WIGAN I'M VERY DOUBTFUL ABOUT MY THEORY AT LEAST I AM NOT CERTAIN THAT I SHALL FIND THE FACTS I WANT A FEW HOURS WILL SETTLE IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER AFTER WALKING ALONG THE ROAD FOR ABOUT A MILE
7190-90542-0036 QUARLES SCRAMBLED THROUGH A HEDGE INTO A WOOD BY THE ROADSIDE
7190-90542-0037 SHOULD WE MEET ANYONE BLAME ME SAY I AM A DODDERING OLD FOOL WHO WOULD WALK UNDER THE TREES
7190-90542-0038 DO YOU GO ARMED ALWAYS I ANSWERED I DO SOMETIMES HE SAID TAPPING HIS POCKET WE MIGHT COME UP AGAINST DANGER IF MY THEORY IS CORRECT IF I TELL YOU TO SHOOT SHOOT AND QUICKLY
7190-90542-0039 YOUR LIFE IS LIKELY TO DEPEND UPON IT AND KEEP YOUR EARS OPEN TO MAKE SURE NO ONE IS FOLLOWING US HE HAD BECOME KEEN LIKE A DOG ON THE TRAIL AND OLD AS HE WAS SEEMED INCAPABLE OF FATIGUE
7190-90542-0040 WHETHER HE HAD STUDIED THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD I CANNOT SAY BUT HE DID NOT HESITATE IN HIS DIRECTION UNTIL HE REACHED A HIGH KNOLL WHICH WAS CLEAR OF THE WOOD AND COMMANDED A CONSIDERABLE VIEW WE WERE TRESPASSERS IN A PRIVATE PARK
7190-90542-0041 TO OUR RIGHT WAS A LARGE HOUSE ONLY PARTIALLY SEEN THROUGH ITS SCREEN OF TREES BUT IT WAS EVIDENTLY MELLOW WITH AGE TO OUR LEFT TOWARD WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY THE EXTREMITY OF THE PARK WAS HILLY GROUND WHICH HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO RUN WILD
7190-90542-0042 TO THIS QUARLES POINTED THAT IS OUR WAY HE SAID WE'LL USE WHAT COVER WE CAN WE PLUNGED INTO THE WOOD AGAIN AND WERE SOON IN THE WILDERNESS FORCING OUR WAY SOMETIMES WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE UNDERGROWTH
7190-90542-0043 ONCE OR TWICE THE PROFESSOR GAVE ME A WARNING GESTURE BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK HE HAD EVIDENTLY SOME DEFINITE GOAL AND I WAS CONSCIOUS OF EXCITEMENT AS I FOLLOWED HIM FOR AN HOUR OR MORE HE TURNED THIS WAY AND THAT EXPLORING EVERY LITTLE RAVINE HE COULD DISCOVER
7190-90542-0044 GRUNTING HIS DISAPPOINTMENT EACH TIME HE FAILED TO FIND WHAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR I SAID I WASN'T CERTAIN HE WHISPERED WHEN OUR PATH HAD LED US INTO A DAMP HOLLOW WHICH LOOKED AS IF IT HAD NOT BEEN VISITED BY MAN FOR CENTURIES MY THEORY SEEMS
7190-90542-0045 AND YET THIS IS SUCH A LIKELY PLACE THERE MUST BE A WAY HE WAS GOING FORWARD AGAIN THE HOLLOW WAS SURROUNDED BY PERPENDICULAR WALLS OF SAND AND CHALK IT WAS A PIT IN FACT WHICH NATURE HAD FILLED WITH VEGETATION THE WAY WE HAD COME SEEMED THE ONLY WAY INTO IT
7190-90542-0046 AH THIS LOOKS PROMISING QUARLES SAID SUDDENLY IN A CORNER OF THE WALL OR TO BE MORE PRECISE FILLING UP A RENT IN IT WAS A SHED ROUGHLY BUILT BUT WITH A DOOR SECURED BY A VERY BUSINESS LIKE LOCK I THINK THE SHED IS CLIMBABLE
7190-90542-0047 SAID QUARLES LET'S GET ON THE ROOF I AM NOT SO YOUNG AS I WAS SO HELP ME UP IT WAS NOT MUCH HELP HE WANTED IN A FEW MOMENTS WE WERE ON THE ROOF AS I THOUGHT HE SAID
7190-90542-0048 WE'LL GO CAREFULLY SAID QUARLES THERE MAY BE WORSE THAN POACHERS TRAPS HERE WITHOUT HELP FROM ME HE DROPPED FROM THE ROOF AND I FOLLOWED HIM THE NATURAL PASSAGE WAS WINDING AND ABOUT FIFTY YARDS LONG AND OPENED INTO ANOTHER PIT OF SOME SIZE
7190-90542-0049 A PIT I CALL IT BUT IT WAS AS MUCH A CAVE AS A PIT PART OF IT RUNNING DEEPLY INTO THE EARTH AND ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF IT BEING OPEN TO THE SKY THE CAVE PART HAD A ROUGH SANDY FLOOR AND HERE WAS A LONG SHED OF PECULIAR CONSTRUCTION
7190-90542-0050 THE BACK PART BEING CLOSED IN THE ROOF WAS THATCHED WITH BARK AND DRIED BRACKEN AND AGAINST ONE END OF THE VERANDA WAS A NOTCHED TREE TRUNK SERVING AS A LADDER AS I EXPECTED SAID QUARLES WITH SOME EXCITEMENT WE MUST GET ONTO THE VERANDA FOR A MOMENT
7190-90542-0051 I THINK WE ARE ALONE HERE BUT KEEP YOUR EARS OPEN THE SHED WAS EVIDENTLY USED SOMETIMES THERE WAS A STONE SLAB WHICH HAD SERVED AS A FIREPLACE AND FROM A BEAM ABOVE HUNG A SHORT CHAIN ON WHICH A POT COULD EASILY BE FIXED WE'LL GET AWAY QUICKLY SAID QUARLES
7190-90542-0052 WHEN IN ABOUT THIRTY HOURS TIME THE PROFESSOR'S SENSE OF DIRECTION WAS MARVELOUS
7190-90542-0053 I DARESAY ONE WOULD BE ALLOWED TO SEE OVER THE HOUSE
7190-90542-0054 HE WAS ALWAYS AS SECRET AS THE GRAVE UNTIL HE HAD PROVED HIS THEORY AND THEN HE SEEMED ANXIOUS TO FORGET THE WHOLE AFFAIR AND SHRANK FROM PUBLICITY
7190-90542-0055 WE GO THERE AGAIN THIS EVENING HE SAID AFTER LUNCH NEXT DAY SO A RESTFUL AFTERNOON WILL SUIT US IT WAS GETTING DARK WHEN WE SET OUT AND AGAIN QUARLES'S UNERRING SENSE OF LOCALITY ASTONISHED ME HE LED THE WAY WITHOUT HESITATION
7190-90542-0056 I THINK WE ARE FIRST BUT GREAT CARE IS NECESSARY HE WHISPERED WE CREPT FORWARD AND CONCEALED OURSELVES AMONG THE SCRUB VEGETATION WHICH GREW IN THAT PART OF THE PIT WHICH WAS OPEN TO THE SKY IT WAS DARK THE LONG SHED BARELY DISCERNIBLE
7190-90542-0057 BUT THE PROFESSOR WAS PARTICULAR ABOUT OUR POSITION WE MAY HAVE TO CREEP A LITTLE NEARER PRESENTLY HE WHISPERED FROM HERE WE CAN DO SO SILENCE WIGAN AND DON'T BE ASTONISHED AT ANYTHING THE WAITING SEEMED LONG MOONLIGHT WAS PRESENTLY ABOVE US
7190-90542-0058 THROWING THE CAVE PART OF THE PIT INTO GREATER SHADOW THAN EVER I CANNOT ATTEMPT TO SAY HOW LONG WE HAD WAITED IN UTTER SILENCE WHEN QUARLES TOUCHED MY ARM SOMEONE WAS COMING AND WITH NO PARTICULAR STEALTH
7190-90542-0059 I HEARD FOOTSTEPS ON THE RAISED FLOOR OF THE SHED A MAN'S STEP AND ONLY ONE MAN'S I HEARD HIM MOVING ABOUT FOR SOME TIME I THINK HE CAME DOWN THE LADDER ONCE AND WENT UP AGAIN
7190-90542-0060 THEN THERE WAS A LIGHT AND SUDDEN TINY FLAMES IN THE DARK HE HAD EVIDENTLY GOT FUEL AND HAD STARTED A FIRE ON THE STONE SLAB AS THE FLAMES BRIGHTENED I WATCHED HIS RESTLESS FIGURE HE WAS NOT A YOUNG MAN
7190-90542-0061 HE WAS SHORT THICK SET AND QUICK IN HIS MOVEMENTS
7190-90542-0062 WHEN HE GOT DOWN AGAIN I SAW THAT A BUNDLE WAS SUSPENDED OVER THE FIRE
7190-90542-0063 ONLY THE SMOKE CURLED ABOUT IT THEN THE MAN MOVED THE WOODEN BLOCK TO THE SIDE OF THE FIRE AND SAT DOWN FACING US THE FLICKERING FLAMES THROWING A RED GLOW OVER HIM WIGAN DO YOU SEE WHISPERED QUARLES NOT CLEARLY WE'LL GO NEARER CAREFULLY
7190-90542-0064 FROM OUR NEW POINT OF VIEW I LOOKED AGAIN THE MAN'S FACE WAS FAMILIAR BUT JUST THEN I COULD NOT REMEMBER WHO HE WAS IT WAS THE BUNDLE HANGING OVER THE FIRE WHICH FASCINATED ME TIED TOGETHER AND SECURED IN A NETWORK OF STRING
7190-90542-0065 WERE FIVE OR SIX HUMAN HEADS BLACKENED SHRIVELED FACES WHICH SEEMED TO GRIN HORRIBLY AS THEY SWUNG DEEPLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE LIT UP BY THE FLICKER OF THE FLAMES DO YOU SEE WIGAN QUARLES ASKED AGAIN YES
7190-90542-0066 AND THE MAN WHO IS HE ON THE BENCH YESTERDAY SIR HENRY BUCKINGHAM
7190-90542-0067 FOR AN HOUR TWO THREE I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THAT HORRIBLE BUNDLE SWUNG OVER THE FIRE AND THE MAN SAT ON HIS BLOCK OF WOOD STARING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM
7190-90542-0068 AND I WAITED EXPECTING SOME FURTHER REVELATION LISTENING FOR OTHER FOOTSTEPS NONE CAME THE FIRE FLICKERED LOWER AND WENT OUT THE MOON HAD SET AND THE COLD OF THE EARLY MORNING GOT INTO MY BONES
7190-90542-0069 IN THE DARKNESS BEFORE THE DAWN THE MAN MOVED ABOUT THE SHED AGAIN AND PRESENTLY I HEARD HIM GO PATIENCE WHISPERED QUARLES AS I STARTED UP TO GO AFTER HIM HE WILL NOT RUN AWAY
7190-90542-0070 MY DEAR WIGAN HE SAID WHEN AT LAST HE CONDESCENDED TO TALK IT WAS ZENA WHO FIRST SET ME ON THE RIGHT ROAD WHEN SHE REMARKED THAT A MAN WHO HAD WALKED IN A DITCH CARRYING A BAG WOULD ARREST ATTENTION TWO POINTS WERE SUGGESTED FIRST
7190-90542-0071 THAT THE MAN MIGHT NOT HAVE FAR TO GO TO REACH A PLACE OF SAFETY SECONDLY THAT HE HAD COME PREPARED TO TAKE A HEAD AWAY WITH HIM A MERE SPECULATION YOU MAY SAY
7190-90542-0072 WHY SHOULD A HEAD BE REQUIRED WHAT KIND OF MAN WOULD BE LIKELY TO WANT A HEAD
7190-90542-0073 I SOUGHT FOR SOME PECULIARITY IN HIS MANNER AND FOUND NONE YET HIS HISTORY COINCIDED WITH MY THEORY YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM I SUPPOSE NOTHING RATHER AN INTERESTING CAREER BUT WITH AN HEREDITARY TAINT IN IT QUARLES WENT ON
7190-90542-0074 HIS MOTHER WAS ECCENTRIC HER HUSBAND WAS RICH ENOUGH TO HAVE HER LOOKED AFTER AT HOME HAD SHE BEEN A POORER PERSON SHE WOULD HAVE DIED IN A MADHOUSE RELIGIOUS MANIA HERS WAS AND HER SON HAS INHERITED IT IN A CURIOUS FASHION
7190-90542-0075 HOW HAVE YOU LEARNT ALL THIS HE IS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO HAVE SOME OF HIS DOINGS CHRONICLED AND HE WROTE SOME INTERESTING ARTICLES FOR A COUNTRY GENTLEMEN'S NEWSPAPER ABOUT HIS NORMANDY TOUR NATURE STUDIES AND SUCH LIKE ANOTHER POINT BOTH THESE MURDERS HAPPENED AT THE TIME OF THE FULL MOON
7190-90542-0076 I AM NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE BUT I THINK YOU WILL FIND THAT FOR THE LAST HALF DOZEN YEARS SIR HENRY HAS NOT BEEN IN ENGLAND IN JANUARY YOU THINK I THINK THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHER HEADS MISSING IF HE HAD BEEN QUARLES ANSWERED
7190-90542-0077 HE WAS SANE ENOUGH TO BE SOMEWHERE WHERE HE WAS NOT KNOWN WHEN THIS TIME OF THE YEAR CAME ROUND AT THE FULL MOON HE IS ALWAYS QUEER WITNESS LAST NIGHT BUT HE IS ONLY DANGEROUS IN JANUARY DANGEROUS I MEAN WITHOUT PROVOCATION
7190-90542-0078 TO PRESERVE HIS SECRET I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT HE WOULD GO TO ANY LENGTH THAT IS WHY I WARNED YOU TO BE READY TO SHOOT WHEN WE WENT UPON OUR JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY NOW THIS YEAR HE WAS IN ENGLAND ILLNESS HAD KEPT HIM TO HIS HOUSE YONDER
7190-90542-0079 AND THE INSANE DESIRE PROVED IRRESISTIBLE HE WAS CUNNING TOO HE MUST KNOW EVERYBODY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD YET THE MAN HE KILLED WAS UNKNOWN WE SHALL FIND PRESENTLY I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE VICTIM WAS SOME WANDERER RETURNING UNEXPECTEDLY TO FRIENDS IN WITHAN
7190-90542-0080 SIR HENRY WAITING IN THE WOOD PERHAPS FOR HOURS MAY HAVE ALLOWED OTHERS TO PASS BEFORE THIS MAN CAME HE REALIZED THAT HE WAS A STRANGER AND ATTACKED HIM BUT THE HEAD
7190-90542-0081 WAS AMONG THOSE HANGING OVER THE FIRE SIR HENRY WAS FOR MANY YEARS IN BORNEO WIGAN AND FOR A LARGE PART OF THE TIME WAS UP COUNTRY HELPING TO PUT DOWN THE HEAD HUNTING WHICH STILL EXISTED THERE AND STILL DOES EXIST ACCORDING TO ALL ACCOUNTS WHEN THE NATIVES THINK THEY CAN ESCAPE DETECTION
7190-90542-0082 THE HORRIBLE CUSTOM PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIS DISEASED BRAIN AND FASCINATED HIM YOU SEE HOW MY THEORY GREW THEN I LOOKED FOR THE ACTUAL PROOF WHICH WE FOUND LAST NIGHT
7190-90542-0083 THE ARREST OF SIR HENRY BUCKINGHAM CAUSED AN ENORMOUS SENSATION HE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY PUT INTO A LUNATIC ASYLUM WHERE HE DIED NOT MANY MONTHS AFTERWARD FORTUNATELY HE HAD NO CHILDREN TO RUN THE RISK OF MADNESS IN THEIR TURN
7190-90543-0000 HOWEVER OBSCURE A MYSTERY MAY BE THERE IS ALWAYS SOME POINT OR CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH IF RIGHTLY INTERPRETED WILL LEAD TO ITS SOLUTION EVEN IN THOSE CRIMES WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN ELUCIDATED THIS POINT EXISTS ONLY IT HAS NEVER BEEN DULY APPRECIATED
7190-90543-0001 FOR WHICH THE DETECTIVE FIRST LOOKS AND SINCE FEW CRIMES IF ANY ARE COMMITTED WITHOUT SOME DEFINITE REASON IT IS MOST FREQUENTLY FOUND IN THE MOTIVE HIS ALMOST SUPERHUMAN POWER OF RECOGNIZING THIS KEY CLEW WAS THE FOUNDATION OF CHRISTOPHER QUARLES'S SUCCESS
7190-90543-0002 AND HIS SOLUTION OF THE MYSTERIOUS BURGLARIES WHICH CAUSED SUCH SPECULATION FOR A TIME WAS NOT THE LEAST OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS SIR JOSEPH MAYNARD THE EMINENT PHYSICIAN OF HARLEY STREET HAD GIVEN A SMALL DINNER PARTY ONE EVENING THE GUESTS LEFT EARLY
7190-90543-0003 AND SOON AFTER MIDNIGHT THE HOUSEHOLD HAD RETIRED NEITHER SIR JOSEPH NOR LADY MAYNARD NOR ANY OF THE SERVANTS WERE DISTURBED DURING THE NIGHT BUT NEXT MORNING IT WAS FOUND THAT BURGLARS HAD ENTERED THEY HAD GOT IN BY A PASSAGE WINDOW AT THE BACK
7190-90543-0004 NOT A VERY DIFFICULT MATTER AND HAD EVIDENTLY GONE TO THE DINING ROOM AND HELPED THEMSELVES TO SPIRITS FROM A TANTALUS WHICH WAS ON THE SIDEBOARD THREE GLASSES WITH A LITTLE OF THE LIQUOR LEFT IN THEM WERE ON THE TABLE AND NEAR THEM WERE SOME BISCUIT CRUMBS
7190-90543-0005 THERE WERE SEVERAL SILVER ARTICLES ON THE SIDEBOARD BUT THESE HAD NOT BEEN TOUCHED THE BURGLARS APPEARED TO HAVE GIVEN ALL THEIR ATTENTION TO SIR JOSEPH'S ROOM WHICH WAS IN A STATE OF CONFUSION TWO CUPBOARDS AND EVERY DRAWER HAD BEEN TURNED OUT AND THE CONTENTS THROWN ABOUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS
7190-90543-0006 BUT OF AN OLD FASHIONED TYPE PRESENTING LITTLE DIFFICULTY TO EXPERTS IN IT BESIDES PAPERS AND ABOUT SEVENTY POUNDS IN GOLD IN A CANVAS BAG
7190-90543-0007 PRESENTATIONS WHICH HAD BEEN MADE TO HIM AND SOME UNIQUE SPECIMENS OF THE QUEEN ANNE PERIOD ALL THIS SILVER WAS UPON THE FLOOR ALSO THE BAG OF MONEY INTACT
7190-90543-0008 IT LOOKED AS IF THE BOX HAD BEEN KNOCKED DOWN AND TRODDEN ON BY MISTAKE FOR THE COUNTERS WERE IN A LITTLE HEAP CLOSE TO THE BROKEN FRAGMENTS IT APPEARED THAT THE BURGLARS MUST HAVE BEEN DISTURBED AND HAD MADE OFF WITHOUT SECURING THEIR BOOTY
7190-90543-0009 THIS WAS THE OBVIOUS EXPLANATION BUT IT DID NOT SATISFY ME I QUESTIONED SIR JOSEPH ABOUT HIS PAPERS HAD HE ANY DOCUMENT WHICH FOR PRIVATE OR PUBLIC REASONS SOMEONE MIGHT BE ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN HE SAID HE HAD NOT
7190-90543-0010 WAS INCLINED TO LAUGH AT MY QUESTION AND PROCEEDED TO INFORM ME THAT HE HAD NO FAMILY SKELETON
7190-90543-0011 HAD NEVER BEEN IN TOUCH WITH ANY MYSTERIOUS SOCIETY
7190-90543-0012 BUT THERE WERE CERTAIN POINTS AGAINST THIS IDEA NO ONE HAD MOVED ABOUT THE HOUSE DURING THE NIGHT
7190-90543-0013 THE SILVER ON THE FLOOR WAS SCATTERED
7190-90543-0014 AND IT LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN THROWN ASIDE CARELESSLY AS THOUGH IT WERE NOT WHAT THE THIEVES WERE IN SEARCH OF AND SURELY HAD THEY LEFT IN A HURRY THE BAG OF MONEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN
7190-90543-0015 MOREOVER THE CIGARETTE ENDS AND THE DIRTY GLASSES SUGGESTED A CERTAIN LEISURELY METHOD OF GOING TO WORK AND MEN OF THIS KIND WOULD NOT BE EASILY FRIGHTENED THE CIGARETTE ENDS PUZZLED ME THEY WERE OF A CHEAP AMERICAN BRAND
7190-90543-0016 HAD NOT BEEN TAKEN FROM SIR JOSEPH'S BOX WHICH CONTAINED ONLY TURKISH ONES AND ALTHOUGH THEY HAD APPARENTLY BEEN THROWN DOWN CARELESSLY THERE WAS NO ASH UPON THE CARPET NOR ANYWHERE ELSE
7190-90543-0017 IF MY IDEA WERE CORRECT IT WOULD MEAN THAT THEY HAD BEEN PUT THERE ON PURPOSE TO MISLEAD I EXAMINED THE THREE GLASSES ON THE DINING ROOM TABLE THERE WAS THE STAIN OF LIPS AT THE RIM OF ONE BUT NOT OF THE OTHER TWO ONLY ONE HAD BEEN DRUNK OUT OF
7190-90543-0018 AND PROBABLY A LITTLE OF THE LIQUID HAD BEEN EMPTIED OUT OF THIS INTO THE OTHER TWO ON INQUIRY ONE OF THE SERVANTS TOLD ME THAT ONLY A VERY LITTLE OF THE SPIRIT HAD BEEN TAKEN SHE ALSO SAID THERE WAS ONLY ONE BISCUIT LEFT IN THE BOX LAST NIGHT AND IT WAS THERE NOW
7190-90543-0019 BY DOING SO I CERTAINLY SAVED ONE VALUABLE LIFE POSSIBLY MORE THAN ONE THAT HE WAS INTERESTED WAS SHOWN BY OUR ADJOURNMENT TO THE EMPTY ROOM
7190-90543-0020 HE SAID I THINK THERE WAS ONLY ONE BURGLAR BUT FOR SOME REASON HE THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT THAT IT SHOULD BE BELIEVED THERE WERE MORE A VERY IMPORTANT POINT AND A REASONABLE CONCLUSION I FANCY SAID QUARLES IF YOU ARE RIGHT IT NARROWS THE SPHERE OF INQUIRY
7190-90543-0021 NARROWS IT VERY MUCH TAKEN WITH THE OTHER FACTS OF THE CASE EXACTLY I ANSWERED THERE IS A SUGGESTION TO MY MIND OF AMATEURISHNESS IN THE AFFAIR I GRANT THE SAFE WAS NOT A DIFFICULT ONE TO BREAK OPEN BUT IT HAD NOT BEEN DONE IN A VERY EXPERT MANNER
7190-90543-0022 THE CIGARETTE ENDS THE DIRTY GLASSES AND THE BISCUIT CRUMBS SEEM TO ME RATHER GRATUITOUS DECEPTIONS AND WAIT SAID QUARLES YOU ASSUME A LITTLE TOO MUCH THEY WOULD HAVE DECEIVED NINE MEN OUT OF TEN YOU HAPPEN TO BE THE TENTH MAN
7190-90543-0023 AMATEUR OR NOT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH A VERY SMART MAN SO DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE ENEMY WIGAN ASSUMING THIS TO BE THE WORK OF AN AMATEUR TO WHAT DEFINITE POINT DOES IT LEAD YOU TO THIS QUESTION I REPLIED DID SIR JOSEPH MAYNARD BURGLE HIS OWN HOUSE
7190-90543-0024 WHY SHOULD YOU THINK SO HIS MANNER WAS CURIOUS THEN THERE IS ONLY HIS OWN STATEMENT THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN TAKEN BUT SUPPOSING HE WISHED TO GET RID OF PAPERS OR
7190-90543-0025 WOULD HE NOT HAVE ROBBED HIMSELF OF SOMETHING TO MAKE THE AFFAIR MORE PLAUSIBLE SAID QUARLES THE AMATEUR CONSTANTLY OVERLOOKS THE OBVIOUS I ANSWERED THE PROFESSOR SHOOK HIS HEAD
7190-90543-0026 I THINK THAT WOULD ENTIRELY DEPEND ON THE MAN'S TEMPERAMENT PROFESSOR
7190-90543-0027 SIR JOSEPH'S STANDING IS VERY HIGH SUDDEN TEMPTATION OR NECESSITY MAY SUBVERT THE HIGHEST CHARACTER I ANSWERED
7190-90543-0028 WHEN I QUESTIONED SIR JOSEPH ABOUT HIS PAPERS HIS MANNER SEEMED CURIOUS AS I HAVE SAID HE AT ONCE DECLARED THAT HE HAD NO PART IN ANY GOVERNMENT SECRET OR MYSTERIOUS SOCIETY GRATUITOUS INFORMATION YOU UNDERSTAND
7190-90543-0029 NOT IN ANSWER TO ANY DIRECT QUESTION OF MINE SHOWING THAT THE IDEAS WERE IN HIS MIND WHY THE EXPLANATION WOULD BE SIMPLE IF HE WERE THE BURGLAR OF HIS OWN PAPERS
7190-90543-0030 I ADMIT THE ARGUMENT IS SOUND WIGAN BUT IT DOES NOT CREEP INTO MY BRAIN WITH ANY COMPELLING INFLUENCE THERE IS A LINK MISSING IN THE CHAIN SOMEWHERE AND HE LOOKED AT ZENA HIS OFTEN REPEATED STATEMENT THAT SHE HELPED HIM BY HER QUESTIONS HAD NEVER IMPRESSED ME VERY GREATLY
7190-90543-0031 WHEN A MYSTERY WAS CLEARED UP IT WAS EASY TO SAY THAT ZENA HAD PUT HIM ON THE RIGHT ROAD AND I CONSIDERED IT A WHIM OF HIS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
7190-90543-0032 IT WAS SO NOW YOU DO NOT SEEM INTERESTED IN THE BROKEN BOX OF COUNTERS SHE SAID TURNING TOWARD HER GRANDFATHER I WONDER WIGAN IS THAT THE CLEW QUARLES SAID QUICKLY IT CREEPS INTO MY BRAIN THE COUNTERS WERE IN A HEAP I SAID
7190-90543-0033 ASKED QUARLES NO THAT WOULD HAVE SCATTERED THEM MORE THEY WERE ROUND AND MIGHT HAVE FALLEN OVER AFTER HAVING BEEN PUT ONE UPON ANOTHER AS ONE GATHERS COPPERS TOGETHER WHEN COUNTING A NUMBER OF THEM SIR JOSEPH PICKED THEM UP
7190-90543-0034 DID THAT STRIKE YOU AS SIGNIFICANT ASKED QUARLES I CANNOT SAY IT DID
7190-90543-0035 THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT WIGAN BUT I CANNOT SEE YET IN WHICH DIRECTION THEY LEAD US WE MUST WAIT FOR THE MOMENT THERE IS NOTHING TO BE DONE I HAD BECOME SO ACCUSTOMED TO QUARLES JUMPING TO SOME SUDDEN CONCLUSION THAT I WAS DISAPPOINTED
7190-90543-0036 NATURALLY I WAS NOT IDLE DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS BUT AT THE END OF THEM I HAD LEARNT NOTHING THEN THE UNEXPECTED HAPPENED ON CONSECUTIVE NIGHTS TWO DOCTORS HOUSES WERE BURGLED THE FIRST WAS IN KENSINGTON
7190-90543-0037 RATHER THAN INTENDED ROBBERY NOTHING HAD BEEN STOLEN BUT EVERYTHING IN HIS ROOM WAS IN DISORDER AND A SMALL AND UNIQUE INLAID CABINET WITH A SECRET SPRING LOCK HAD BEEN SMASHED TO PIECES SEVERAL CIGARETTE ENDS WERE ON THE FLOOR
7190-90543-0038 HE HAD SEVERAL CABINETS IN HIS ROOM CONTAINING SPECIMENS AND EVERYTHING HAD BEEN TURNED ON TO THE FLOOR AND DAMAGED MORE OR LESS IN FACT ALTHOUGH NOTHING HAD BEEN TAKEN THE DAMAGE WAS CONSIDERABLE ON THE NIGHT OF THE BURGLARY DOCTOR WOOD WAS AWAY FROM HOME
7190-90543-0039 ONLY SERVANTS BEING IN THE HOUSE THE COOK SUFFERING FROM FACEACHE HAD BEEN RESTLESS ALL NIGHT BUT HAD HEARD NOTHING
7190-90543-0040 FOR A REVOLVER LOADED IN EVERY CHAMBER WAS FOUND ON ONE OF THE CABINETS APPARENTLY HAVING PUT IT READY FOR USE HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO TAKE IT AWAY THE DOCTOR WAS FURIOUS AT THE WANTON DESTRUCTION OF HIS SPECIMENS
7190-90543-0041 THE UNEXPECTED HAS HAPPENED I SAID NO NO THE EXPECTED
7190-90543-0042 I'VE READ EVERY REPORT BUT TELL ME YOURSELF EVERY DETAIL I DID SO THE SAME BRAND OF CIGARETTES HE ASKED NO BUT ALL CHEAP AMERICAN ONES
7190-90543-0043 YOU STILL THINK THAT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED
7190-90543-0044 NO I HOLD TO THE ONE MAN THEORY AND YOU ARE RIGHT HE SNAPPED I ADMIT I MIGHT NOT HAVE GOT UPON THE RIGHT TRACK HAD YOU NOT MADE THAT DISCOVERY IT WAS CLEVER WIGAN IT DID NOT SEEM TO HELP YOU TO A THEORY I ANSWERED TRUE
7190-90543-0045 MUCH DEPENDED UPON THE ANSWER IF HE HAD
7190-90543-0046 IF THE THIEF HAD NOT FOUND WHAT HE WANTED HE WOULD CONTINUE HIS SEARCH I ARGUED FOR SOME REASON HE CONNECTED SIR JOSEPH MAYNARD WITH THE OBJECT OF HIS SEARCH
7226-86964-0000 WE WERE SOMEWHAT JADED BY THE TIME MONDAY MORNING CAME FOR SUNDAY BROUGHT NOT ONLY NO RELIEF BUT REPETITIONS OF MANY OF THE MOST HORRIBLE OF THESE TALES OF A WAYSIDE INN
7226-86964-0001 IT WAS WITH NO SLIGHT SENSE OF RELIEF THAT WE PAID OUR MODEST BILL AND AT LAST BROKE AWAY FROM SUCH GHASTLY ASSOCIATIONS AN INVOLUNTARY SHUDDER OVERCAME ME AS WE PASSED THE HEAD OF THE ISLAND
7226-86964-0002 AT THE FOOT OF OUR HOST'S ORCHARD WHICH HE HAD DESCRIBED AS A CATCH BASIN FOR HUMAN FLOATERS OUR COURSE STILL LAY AMONG LARGE DENSELY WOODED ISLANDS MANY OF THEM WHOLLY GIVEN UP TO MAPLES AND WILLOWS
7226-86964-0003 AND DEEP CUTS THROUGH SUN BAKED MUDBANKS THE COLOR OF ADOBE BUT OCCASIONALLY THERE ARE LOW GLOOMY BOTTOMS HEAVILY FORESTED AND STREWN WITH FLOOD WOOD WHILE BEYOND THE LAND RISES GRADUALLY INTO PRAIRIE STRETCHES
7226-86964-0004 IN THE BOTTOMS THE TREES ARE FILLED WITH FLOCKS OF BIRDS CROWS HAWKS BLACKBIRDS WITH STATELY BLUE HERONS AND AGILE PLOVERS FORAGING ON THE LONG GRAVEL SPITS WHICH FREQUENTLY JUT FAR INTO THE STREAM
7226-86964-0005 DUCKS ARE FREQUENTLY SEEN SAILING NEAR THE SHORES WHILE DIVERS SILENTLY DART AND PLUNGE AHEAD OF THE CANOE SAFELY OUT OF GUNSHOT REACH A HEAD WIND THIS MORNING MADE ROWING MORE DIFFICULT BY COUNTERACTING THE INFLUENCE OF THE CURRENT
7226-86964-0006 WE WERE AT LYNDON AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THERE IS A POPULATION OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED CLUSTERED AROUND A RED PAPER MILL THE LATTER MADE A PRETTY PICTURE STANDING OUT ON THE BOLD BANK BACKED BY A NUMBER OF HUGE STACKS OF GOLDEN STRAW
7226-86964-0007 WE MET HERE THE FIRST RAPIDS WORTHY OF RECORD ALSO AN OLD ABANDONED MILL DAM IN THE LAST STAGES OF DECAY STRETCHING ITS WHITENED SKELETON ACROSS THE STREAM A HARBOR FOR DRIFTWOOD
7226-86964-0008 NEAR THE SOUTH BANK THE FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN ENTIRELY SWEPT AWAY FOR A SPACE SEVERAL RODS IN WIDTH AND THROUGH THIS OPENING THE PENT UP CURRENT FIERCELY SWEEPS WE WENT THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE CHANNEL THUS MADE WITH A SWOOP
7226-86964-0009 THAT GAVE US AN IMPETUS WHICH SOON CARRIED OUR VESSEL OUT OF SIGHT OF LYNDON AND ITS PAPER MILL AND STRAW STACKS PROPHETSTOWN FIVE MILES BELOW IS PRETTILY SITUATED IN AN OAK GROVE ON THE SOUTHERN BANK
7226-86964-0010 ONLY THE GABLES OF A FEW HOUSES CAN BE SEEN FROM THE RIVER WHOSE BANKS OF YELLOW CLAY AND BROWN MUD ARE HERE TWENTY FIVE FEET HIGH DURING THE FIRST THIRD OF THE PRESENT CENTURY THIS PLACE WAS THE SITE OF A WINNEBAGO VILLAGE WHOSE CHIEF
7226-86964-0011 WAS WHITE CLOUD A SHREWD SINISTER SAVAGE HALF WINNEBAGO AND HALF SAC WHO CLAIMED TO BE A PROPHET HE WAS BLACK HAWK'S EVIL GENIUS DURING THE UPRISING OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO AND IN MANY WAYS
7226-86964-0012 WAS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE ABORIGINES KNOWN TO ILLINOIS HISTORY IT WAS AT THE PROPHET'S TOWN AS WHITE CLOUD'S VILLAGE WAS KNOWN IN PIONEER DAYS THAT BLACK HAWK RESTED UPON HIS ILL FATED JOURNEY UP THE ROCK AND FROM HERE
7226-86964-0013 AT THE INSTIGATION OF THE WIZARD HE BADE THE UNITED STATES SOLDIERY DEFIANCE THERE ARE RAPIDS ALMOST CONTINUALLY FROM A MILE ABOVE PROPHETSTOWN TO ERIE TEN MILES BELOW THE RIVER BED HERE HAS A SHARPER DESCENT THAN CUSTOMARY
7226-86964-0014 AND IS THICKLY STREWN WITH BOWLDERS MANY OF THEM WERE VISIBLE ABOVE THE SURFACE AT THE LOW STAGE OF WATER WHICH WE FOUND BUT FOR THE GREATER PART THEY WERE COVERED FOR TWO OR THREE INCHES WHAT WITH THESE IMPEDIMENTS
7226-86964-0015 THE SNAGS THAT HAD BEEN LEFT AS THE LEGACY OF LAST SPRING'S FLOOD AND THE FREQUENT SAND BANKS AND GRAVEL SPITS NAVIGATION WAS ATTENDED BY MANY DIFFICULTIES AND SOME DANGERS FOUR OR FIVE MILES BELOW PROPHETSTOWN
7226-86964-0016 A LONE FISHERMAN ENGAGED IN EXAMINING A TRAUT LINE STRETCHED BETWEEN ONE OF THE NUMEROUS GLOOMY ISLANDS AND THE MAINLAND KINDLY INFORMED US OF A MILE LONG CUT OFF THE MOUTH OF WHICH WAS NOW IN VIEW THAT WOULD SAVE US SEVERAL MILES OF ROWING
7226-86964-0017 HERE THE HIGH BANKS HAD RECEDED WITH SEVERAL MILES OF HEAVILY WOODED BOGGY BOTTOMS INTERVENING FLOODS HAD HELD HIGH CARNIVAL AND THE ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY WAS WILD AND DESERTED THE CUT OFF WAS AN UGLY LOOKING CHANNEL
7226-86964-0018 BUT WHERE OUR INFORMANT HAD GONE THROUGH WITH HIS UNWIELDY HULK WE CONSIDERED IT SAFE TO VENTURE WITH A CANOE SO READILY RESPONSIVE TO THE SLIGHTEST PADDLE STROKE
7226-86964-0019 IT WAS A SCENE OF HOWLING DESOLATION RACK AND RUIN UPON EVERY HAND THE MUDDY TORRENT AT A VELOCITY OF FULLY EIGHT MILES AN HOUR WENT EDDYING AND WHIRLING AND DARTING AND ROARING AMONG THE GNARLED AND BLACKENED STUMPS THE PROSTRATE TREES
7226-86964-0020 THE TWISTED ROOTS THE HUGE BOWLDERS WHICH STUDDED ITS COURSE THE STREAM WAS NOT WIDE ENOUGH FOR THE OARS THE PADDLE WAS THE SOLE RELIANCE WITH EYES STRAINED FOR OBSTRUCTIONS WE TURNED AND TWISTED THROUGH THE LABYRINTH
7226-86964-0021 JUMPING ALONG AT A BREAKNECK SPEED AND WHEN WE FINALLY REJOINED THE MAIN RIVER BELOW WERE GRATEFUL ENOUGH FOR THE RUN HAD BEEN FILLED WITH CONTINUOUS POSSIBILITIES OF A DISASTROUS SMASH UP MILES AWAY FROM ANY HUMAN HABITATION
7226-86964-0022 THE THUNDER STORM WHICH HAD BEEN THREATENING SINCE EARLY MORNING SOON BURST UPON US WITH A PRELIMINARY WIND BLAST FOLLOWED BY DRENCHING RAIN RUNNING ASHORE ON THE LEE BANK WE WRAPPED THE CANVAS AWNING AROUND THE BAGGAGE
7226-86964-0023 AND MADE FOR A THICK CLUMP OF TREES ON THE TOP OF AN ISLAND MUDBANK WHERE WE STOOD BUTTONED TO THE NECK IN RUBBER COATS A VIGOROUS HALLOO CAME SOUNDING OVER THE WATER LOOKING UP WE SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME A SMALL TENT ON THE OPPOSITE SHORE
7226-86964-0024 A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY IN FRONT OF WHICH WAS A MAN SHOUTING TO US AND BECKONING US OVER IT WAS GETTING UNCOMFORTABLY MUDDY UNDER THE TREES WHICH HAD NOT LONG SUFFICED AS AN UMBRELLA AND THE RUBBER COATS WERE NOT WARRANTED TO WITHSTAND A DELUGE
7226-86964-0025 SO WE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION WITH ALACRITY AND PADDLED OVER THROUGH THE PELTING STORM OUR HOST WAS A YOUNG FISHERMAN WHO HELPED US AND OUR LUGGAGE UP THE SLIMY BANK TO HIS CANVAS QUARTERS WHICH WE FOUND TO BE DRY ALTHOUGH ODOROUS OF FISH
7226-86964-0026 WHILE THE STORM RAGED WITHOUT THE YOUNG MAN WHO WAS A SIMPLE HEARTED FELLOW CONFIDED TO US THE DETAILS OF HIS BRIEF CAREER HE HAD BEEN MARRIED BUT A YEAR HE SAID HIS LITTLE CABIN LAY A QUARTER OF A MILE BACK IN THE WOODS
7226-86964-0027 AND SO AS TO BE CONVENIENT TO HIS LINES HE WAS CAMPING ON HIS OWN WOOD LOT THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME WAS SPENT IN FISHING OR HUNTING ACCORDING TO THE SEASON AND PEDDLING THE PRODUCT IN NEIGHBORING TOWNS
7226-86964-0028 WHICH HAD RECENTLY BECOME ENRICHED BY THE ADDITION OF AN INFANT SON THE PHENOMENAL POWERS OF OBSERVATION DISPLAYED BY THIS FIRST BORN YOUTH WERE REPORTED WITH MUCH DETAIL BY THE FOND FATHER WHO SAT CROUCHED UPON A BOAT SAIL IN ONE CORNER OF THE LITTLE TENT
7226-86964-0029 HIS HEAD BETWEEN HIS KNEES AND SMOKING VILE TOBACCO IN A BLACKENED CLAY PIPE IT SEEMED THAT HIS WIFE WAS A FERRYMAN'S DAUGHTER AND HER FATHER HAD BESOUGHT HIS SON IN LAW TO FOLLOW THE SAME STEADY CALLING TO BE SURE OUR HOST DECLARED FERRIES ON THE ROCK RIVER NETTED THEIR OWNERS
7226-86964-0030 WHICH HE CONSIDERED A GOODLY SUM AND HIS FATHER IN LAW HAD OFFERED TO PURCHASE AN ESTABLISHED PLANT FOR HIM BUT THE YOUNG FELLOW SAID THAT FERRYING WAS A DOG'S LIFE AND KEPT A FELLER HOME LIKE BARN CHORES
7226-86964-0031 SO REJECTED THE OFFER AND SETTLED DOWN AVOWEDLY FOR LIFE IN HIS PRESENT PRECARIOUS OCCUPATION AS A RESULT THE INDIGNANT OLD MAN HAD FORBIDDEN HIM TO AGAIN ENTER THE PARENTAL FERRY HOUSE UNTIL HE AGREED TO ACCEPT HIS PROPOSALS
7226-86964-0032 AND THERE WAS HENCEFORTH TO BE A STANDING FAMILY QUARREL THE FISHERMAN HAVING APPEALED TO MY JUDGMENT I ENDEAVORED WITH MILD CAUTION TO ARGUE HIM OUT OF HIS POSITION ON THE SCORE OF CONSIDERATION FOR HIS WIFE AND LITTLE ONE
7226-86964-0033 AND FIRMLY THOUGH WITH ADMIRABLE GOOD NATURE PERSISTED IN DEFENDING HIS ROVING TENDENCIES IN THE COURSE OF OUR CONVERSATION I LEARNED THAT THE FERRYMEN WHO ARE MORE NUMEROUS ON THE LOWER THAN ON THE UPPER ROCK PAY AN ANNUAL LICENSE FEE OF FIVE DOLLARS EACH
7226-86964-0034 IN CONSIDERATION OF WHICH THEY ARE GUARANTIED A MONOPOLY OF THE BUSINESS AT THEIR STANDS NO OTHER LINE BEING ALLOWED WITHIN ONE MILE OF AN EXISTING FERRY WITHIN AN HOUR AND A HALF THE STORM HAD APPARENTLY PASSED OVER AND WE CONTINUED OUR JOURNEY
7226-86964-0035 BUT AFTER SUPPER ANOTHER SHOWER AND A STIFF HEAD WIND CAME UP AND WE WERE WELL BEDRAGGLED BY THE TIME A FERRY LANDING NEAR THE LITTLE VILLAGE OF ERIE WAS REACHED THE BOTTOMS ARE HERE A MILE OR TWO IN WIDTH WITH OCCASIONAL OPENINGS IN THE WOODS
7226-86964-0036 WHERE SMALL FIELDS ARE CULTIVATED BY THE POORER CLASS OF FARMERS WHO WERE LAST SPRING MUCH DAMAGED BY THE FLOOD WHICH SWEPT THIS ENTIRE COUNTRY THE FERRYMAN A GOOD NATURED YOUNG ATHLETE
7226-86964-0037 WAS LANDING A FARM WAGON AND TEAM AS WE PULLED IN UPON THE MUDDY ROADWAY WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT QUARTERS HE SMILED AND POINTING TO HIS LITTLE CABIN A FEW RODS OFF IN THE BUSHES SAID WE'VE FOUR PEOPLE TO SLEEP IN TWO ROOMS
7226-86964-0038 IT'S SURE WE CAN'T TAKE YE I'D LIKE TO OTHERWISE BUT ERIE'S ONLY A MILE AWAY WE ASSURED HIM THAT WITH THESE MUDDY SWAMP ROADS AND IN OUR WET CONDITION NOTHING BUT ABSOLUTE NECESSITY WOULD INDUCE US TO TAKE A MILE'S TRAMP THE PARLEY
7226-86964-0039 ENDED IN OUR BEING DIRECTED TO A SMALL FARM HOUSE A QUARTER OF A MILE INLAND WHERE LUCKLESS TRAVELERS BELATED ON THE DREARY BOTTOMS WERE OCCASIONALLY KEPT MAKING THE CANOE FAST FOR THE NIGHT WE STRUNG OUR BAGGAGE PACKS UPON THE PADDLE WHICH WE CARRIED BETWEEN US
7226-86964-0040 AND SET OUT ALONG A DEVIOUS WAY THROUGH A DRIVING MIST WHICH BLACKENED THE TWILIGHT INTO DUSK TO FIND THIS PLACE OF PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT IT IS A LITTLE ONE STORY DILAPIDATED FARM HOUSE
7226-86964-0041 STANDING A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE COUNTRY ROAD AMID A CLUMP OF POPLAR TREES FORCING OUR WAY THROUGH THE HINGELESS GATE THE VIOLENT REMOVAL OF WHICH THREATENED THE IMMEDIATE DESTRUCTION OF SEVERAL LENGTHS OF RICKETY FENCE
7226-86964-0042 WE WALKED UP TO THE OPEN FRONT DOOR AND APPLIED FOR SHELTER YES MA'AM WE SOMETIMES KEEPS TAVERN MA'AM REPLIED A LARGE GREASY LOOKING BLACK HAIRED WOMAN OF SOME FORTY YEARS
7226-86964-0043 AS HER HANDS FOLDED WITHIN HER UP TURNED APRON SHE COURTESIED TO W WE WERE AT ONCE SHOWN INTO A FROWSY APARTMENT WHICH SERVED AS PARLOR SITTING ROOM AND PARENTAL DORMITORY
7226-86964-0044 AND CHEAP DECORATIONS PECULIAR IN THE COUNTRY TO ALL THREE CLASSES OF ROOMS THE EVIDENCES OF POVERTY SHIFTLESSNESS AND UNTASTEFUL PRETENTIOUSNESS UPON EVERY SIDE
7226-86964-0045 A HUGE WHEEZY OLD CABINET ORGAN WAS SET DIAGONALLY IN ONE CORNER AND UPON THIS AS WE ENTERED A YOUNG WOMAN WAS POUNDING AND PADDLING WITH MUCH VIGOR WHILE GIVING US SIDELONG GLANCES OF CURIOSITY
7226-86964-0046 SHE WAS A NEIGHBOR ON AN EVENING VISIT DECKED OUT IN A SMART JOCKEY CAP WITH A GREEN OSTRICH TIP AND BRIGHT BLUE RIBBONS AND GAY IN A NEW CALICO DRESS
7226-86964-0047 A YELLOW FIELD THICKLY PLANTED TO PURPLE PINEAPPLES A JAUNTY FORWARD CREATURE IN PIMPLES AND CURLS SHE RATTLED AWAY THROUGH A MOODY AND SANKEY HYMN BOOK THE WHEEZES AND GROANS OF THE ANTIQUE INSTRUMENT

7226-86964-0053 THE BED CHAMBER INTO WHICH WE WERE SHOWN WAS A MARVEL IT OPENED OFF THE MAIN ROOM AND WAS DOUBTLESS ORIGINALLY A CUPBOARD SEVEN FEET SQUARE WITH A BROAD ROPED BEDSTEAD OCCUPYING THE ENTIRE LENGTH
7226-86964-0054 NECESSITATING THE USE OF THE BED AS A DRESSING PLACE AFTER THE FASHION OF A SLEEPING CAR BUNK THIS CUBBY HOLE OF A ROOM WAS ALSO THE WARDROBE FOR THE WOMEN OF THE HOUSEHOLD THE WALLS ABOVE THE BED BEING HUNG NEARLY TWO FEET DEEP

7226-86964-0056 FOR IT WAS AS DARK AS EGYPT WITHIN EXCEPT FOR A FEW FAINT RAYS OF LIGHT WHICH CAME STRAGGLING THROUGH THE CRACKS IN THE BOARD PARTITION SEPARATING US FROM THE SITTING ROOM CANDLE WE HAD NO SOONER CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF OUR LITTLE BOX
7226-86964-0057 THAN THE CREAKY OLD CLEAT DOOR WAS GENTLY CLOSED UPON US AND BUTTONED BY OUR HOSTESS UPON THE OUTSIDE AS THE ONLY MEANS OF KEEPING IT SHUT AND WE WERE LEFT FREE TO GROPE ABOUT AMONG THESE MYSTERIES AS BEST WE MIGHT
7226-86964-0058 WE HAD HARDLY RECOVERED FROM OUR ASTONISHMENT AT THUS BEING LOCKED INTO A DARK HOLE THE SIZE OF A FASHIONABLE LADY'S TRUNK AND WERE QUIETLY LAUGHING OVER THIS ODD ADVENTURE WHEN THE LANDLADY APPLIED HER MOUTH TO A CRACK AND SHOUTED AS IF SHE WOULD HAVE WAKED THE DEAD HI THERE
7226-86964-0059 A FEW MINUTES LATER RETURNING TO THE CRACK SHE ADDED
7226-86964-0060 REPRESSING OUR MIRTH WE ASSURED OUR GOOD HOSTESS THAT WE WOULD HAVE A DUE REGARD FOR OUR PERSONAL SAFETY
7226-86965-0000 WE HAD BREAKFAST IN THE TAVERN KITCHEN

7226-86965-0002 WHILE THE HEIR OF THE HOUSEHOLD SOMEWHAT YOUNGER WAS A GAPING GRINNING YOUTH OF THE SIMPLE SIMON ORDER WHO SHOVELLED MASHED POTATOES INTO HIS MOUTH ALTERNATELY WITH KNIFE AND FORK AND TOOK BITES OF BREAD LARGE ENOUGH FOR A RAVENOUS DOG
7226-86965-0003 THE OLD GRANDMOTHER WITH A FACE LIKE PARCHMENT AND ONE GLEAMING EYE SAT IN A LOW ROCKING CHAIR BY THE STOVE CROONING OVER A CORN COB PIPE AND USING THE WOOD BOX FOR A CUSPADORE SHE HAD A VINEGARY SLANGY TONGUE
7226-86965-0004 AND BEING SOMEWHAT DEAF WOULD BREAK IN UPON THE CONVERSATION WITH REMARKS SHARPER THAN THEY WERE PAT WITH OUR HOST A GLIB AND RAPID TALKER IN A SWAGGERING TONE ONE COULD NOT BUT BE MUCH AMUSED
7226-86965-0005 AS HE EXHIBITED A DEGREE OF SELF APPRECIATION THAT WAS DECIDEDLY REFRESHING HE HAD BEEN A VETERAN IN THE WAR OF THE REBELLION HE PROUDLY ASSURED US AND POINTED WITH HIS KNIFE TO HIS DISCHARGE PAPER WHICH WAS HUNG UP IN AN OLD LOOKING GLASS FRAME
7226-86965-0006 BY THE SIDE OF THE CLOCK GEMMEN HE INVARIABLY THUS ADDRESSED US AS THOUGH WE WERE A COTERIE OF CHECKER PLAYERS AT A VILLAGE GROCERY GEMMEN WHEN I SEEN HOW THEM JOHNNY REBS WAS A USIN OUR BOYS IN THEM PRISON PENS
7226-86965-0007 JOE MY BOY YOU GO NOW AN DO SOME'N FER YER COUNTRY A CRACK SHOT LIKE YOU IS JOE SAYS I TO MYSELF AS KIN HIT A DUCK ON THE WING EVERY TIME AN NO MISTAKE
7226-86965-0008 AN SO I JINED AN I STUCK HER OUT GEMMEN TILL THE THING WAS DONE THEY AIN'T NO COWARD BOUT ME

7226-86965-0014 THERE WAS HEAPS O BLOOD SPILT UNNECESSARY BY US BOYS A FIGHTIN TO SAVE THE OL FLAG
7226-86965-0015 I SAID TO OUR LANDLORD BY WAY OF HELPING ALONG THE CONVERSATION THERE WAS A MOMENTARY SILENCE BROKEN BY SIMPLE SIMON WHO WIPED HIS KNIFE ON HIS TONGUE AND MADE A WILD ATTACK ON THE BUTTER DISH PA HE DRUV A MULE TEAM FOR GOV'MENT
7226-86965-0016 WITH A BIG AMMERNITION WAGIN ON BEHIND
7226-86965-0017 THIS SUDDEN REVELATION OF THE STRENGTH OF THE VETERAN'S CLAIM TO GLORY AND A PENSION PUT A DAMPER UPON HIS REMINISCENCES OF THE WAR AND GIVING THE INNOCENT SIMON A SAVAGE LEER
7226-86965-0018 HE SOON CONTRIVED TO TURN THE CONVERSATION UPON HIS WONDERFUL EXPLOITS IN DUCK SHOOTING AND FISHING INDUSTRIES IN THE PURSUIT OF WHICH HE WITH SO MANY OF HIS FELLOW FARMERS ON THE BOTTOMS APPEARED TO BE MORE EAGER THAN IN TILLING THE SOIL
7226-86965-0019 IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT THAT THE BREAKFAST WE WERE EATING WAS A SPECIAL SPREAD IN HONOR OF PROBABLY THE ONLY GUESTS THE QUONDAM TAVERN HAD HAD THESE MANY MONTHS CANOEISTS MUST NOT BE TOO PARTICULAR ABOUT THE FARE SET BEFORE THEM BUT ON THIS OCCASION
7226-86965-0020 WE WERE ABLE TO SWALLOW BUT A FEW MOUTHFULS OF THE REPAST AND OUR LUNCH BASKET WAS DRAWN ON AS SOON AS WE WERE ONCE MORE AFLOAT IT IS A GREAT PITY THAT SO MANY FARMERS WIVES ARE THE WRETCHED COOKS THEY ARE
7226-86965-0021 WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF GOOD MATERIALS ALREADY ABOUT THEM AND RARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR READILY ACQUIRING MORE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF RURAL DAMES DO MANAGE TO PREPARE ASTONISHINGLY INEDIBLE MEALS
7226-86965-0022 SOUR DOUGHY BREAD POTATOES WHICH IF BOILED ARE BUT HALF COOKED AND IF MASHED ARE FLOATED WITH ABOMINABLE BUTTER OR PASTEY FLOUR GRAVY SALT PORK EITHER SWIMMING IN A BOWL OF GREASE OR FRIED TO A LEATHERY CHIP
7226-86965-0023 TEA AND COFFEE EXTREMELY WEAK OR STRONG ENOUGH TO KILL AN OX AS CHANCE MAY DICTATE AND INEVITABLY ADULTERATED BEYOND RECOGNITION
7226-86965-0024 EGGS THAT ARE SPOILED BY BEING FRIED TO THE CONSISTENCY OF RUBBER IN A PAN OF FAT DEEP ENOUGH TO FLOAT DOUGHNUTS WHILE THE BISCUITS ARE YELLOW AND BITTER WITH SALERATUS THIS BILL OF FARE WARRANTED TO DESTROY THE BEST OF APPETITES
7226-86965-0025 WILL BE RECOGNIZED BY TOO MANY OF MY READERS AS THAT TO BE FOUND AT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FARM HOUSE ALTHOUGH WE ALL DOUBTLESS KNOW OF SOME MAGNIFICENT EXCEPTIONS WHICH ONLY PROVE THE RULE WE ESTABLISH PUBLIC COOKING SCHOOLS IN OUR CITIES
7226-86965-0026 AND ECONOMISTS LIKE EDWARD ATKINSON AND HYGIENISTS LIKE THE LATE DIO LEWIS ASSIDUOUSLY EXPLAIN TO THE METROPOLITAN POOR THEIR PROCESSES OF MAKING A TEMPTING MEAL OUT OF NOTHING
7226-86965-0027 BUT OUR MOST CRYING NEED IN THIS COUNTRY TO DAY IS A TRAINING SCHOOL FOR RURAL HOUSEWIVES WHERE THEY MAY BE TAUGHT TO EVOLVE A RESPECTABLE AND ECONOMICAL SPREAD OUT OF THE GREAT ABUNDANCE WITH WHICH THEY ARE SURROUNDED
7226-86965-0028 IT IS NO WONDER THAT COUNTRY BOYS DRIFT TO THE CITIES WHERE THEY CAN OBTAIN PROPERLY COOKED FOOD AND LIVE LIKE RATIONAL BEINGS THE RIVER CONTINUES TO WIDEN AS WE APPROACH THE JUNCTION WITH THE MISSISSIPPI THIRTY NINE MILES BELOW ERIE
7226-86965-0029 AND TO ASSUME THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GREAT RIVER INTO WHICH IT POURS ITS FLOOD THE ISLANDS INCREASE IN NUMBER AND IN SIZE SOME OF THEM BEING OVER A MILE IN LENGTH BY A QUARTER OF A MILE IN BREADTH
7226-86965-0030 THE BOTTOMS FREQUENTLY RESOLVE THEMSELVES INTO WIDE MORASSES THICKLY STUDDED WITH GREAT ELMS MAPLES AND COTTON WOODS AMONG WHICH THE SPRING FLOOD HAS WROUGHT DIREFUL DESTRUCTION THE SCENE BECOMES PECULIARLY DESOLATE
7226-86965-0031 AND MOURNFUL OFTEN GIVING ONE THE IMPRESSION OF BEING FAR REMOVED FROM CIVILIZATION THREADING THE COURSE OF SOME HITHERTO UNEXPLORED STREAM PENETRATE THE DEEP FRINGE OF FOREST AND MORASS ON FOOT HOWEVER AND SMILING PRAIRIES ARE FOUND BEYOND
7226-86965-0032 OF BEING EITHER GROUNDED OR CAPSIZED NOW AND THEN THE BANKS BECOME FIRMER WITH CHARMING VISTAS OF HIGH WOODED HILLS COMING DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE BROAD SAVANNAS INTERVENE DECKED OUT WITH VARIEGATED FLORA
7226-86965-0033 THE SPIDER WORT THE LITTLE BLUE LOBELIA AND THE CUP WEED THESE SAVANNAS ARE APPARENTLY OVERFLOWED IN TIMES OF EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH WATER
7226-86965-0034 AND THERE ARE EVIDENCES THAT THE STREAM HAS OCCASIONALLY CHANGED ITS COURSE THROUGH THE SUNBAKED BANKS OF ASHY GRAY MUD IN YEARS LONG PAST AT CLEVELAND A STAID LITTLE VILLAGE ON AN OPEN PLAIN WHICH WE REACHED SOON AFTER THE DINNER HOUR
7226-86965-0035 THERE IS AN UNUSED MILL DAM GOING TO DECAY IN THE CENTRE THE MAIN CURRENT HAS WASHED OUT A BREADTH OF THREE OR FOUR RODS THROUGH WHICH THE PENT UP STREAM RUSHES WITH A ROAR AND A HUNDRED WHIRLPOOLS IT IS AN UGLY CREVASSE
7226-86965-0036 BUT A CAREFUL EXAMINATION SHOWED THE PASSAGE TO BE FEASIBLE SO WE RETREATED AN EIGHTH OF A MILE UP STREAM TOOK OUR BEARINGS AND WENT THROUGH WITH A SPEED THAT NEARLY TOOK OUR BREATH AWAY AND APPEARED TO GREATLY ASTONISH A HALF DOZEN FISHERMEN
7226-86965-0037 IDLY ANGLING FROM THE DILAPIDATED APRON ON EITHER SIDE IT WAS LIKE GOING THROUGH CLEVELAND ON THE FAST MAIL FOURTEEN MILES ABOVE THE MOUTH OF THE ROCK IS THE CHICAGO BURLINGTON AND QUINCY RAILROAD BRIDGE WITH CARBON CLIFF ON THE NORTH
7226-86965-0038 AND COLOMA ON THE SOUTH EACH ONE MILE FROM THE RIVER THE DAY HAD BEEN DARK WITH OCCASIONAL SLIGHT SHOWERS AND A STIFF HEAD WIND SO THAT PROGRESS HAD BEEN SLOW WE BEGAN TO DEEM IT WORTH WHILE TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS AT THE MOUTH
7226-86965-0039 STOPPING TO QUESTION THEM WE FOUND THEM BOTH WELL INFORMED AS TO THE RAILWAY TIME TABLES OF THE VICINITY AND THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE LOWER RIVER THEY TOLD US THAT THE SCENERY FOR THE NEXT FOURTEEN MILES WAS SIMILAR IN ITS DARK DESOLATION TO THAT WHICH WE HAD PASSED THROUGH DURING THE DAY
7226-86965-0040 ALSO THAT OWING TO THE GREAT NUMBER OF ISLANDS AND THE LABYRINTH OF CHANNELS BOTH IN THE ROCK AND ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE MISSISSIPPI WE SHOULD FIND IT PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHEN WE HAD REACHED THE LATTER WE SHOULD DOUBTLESS PROCEED SEVERAL MILES BELOW THE MOUTH OF THE ROCK
7226-86965-0041 BEFORE WE NOTICED THAT THE CURRENT WAS SETTING PERSISTENTLY SOUTH AND THEN WOULD HAVE AN EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT TASK IN RETRACING OUR COURSE AND PULLING UP STREAM TO OUR DESTINATION ROCK ISLAND WHICH IS SIX MILES NORTH OF THE DELTA OF THE ROCK
7226-86965-0042 THEY STRONGLY ADVISED OUR GOING INTO ROCK ISLAND BY RAIL THE PRESENT LANDING WAS THE LAST CHANCE TO STRIKE A RAILWAY EXCEPT AT MILAN TWELVE MILES BELOW IT WAS NOW SO LATE THAT WE COULD NOT HOPE TO REACH MILAN BEFORE DARK
7226-86965-0043 AND MILAN WAS FARTHER FROM ROCK ISLAND THAN EITHER CARBON CLIFF OR COLOMA WITH LESS FREQUENT RAILWAY SERVICE FOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS WE DECIDED TO ACCEPT THIS ADVICE AND TO SHIP FROM COLOMA
7226-86965-0044 TAKING A FINAL SPURT DOWN TO A FERRY LANDING A QUARTER OF A MILE BEYOND ON THE SOUTH BANK
7226-86965-0045 HAVING VOYAGED TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN MILES IN SOMEWHAT LESS THAN SEVEN DAYS AND A HALF LEAVING W TO GOSSIP WITH THE FERRYMAN'S WIFE WHO CAME DOWN TO THE BANK WITH AN ARMFUL OF SMILING TWINS TO VIEW A CRAFT SO STRANGE TO HER VISION
7226-86965-0046 I WENT UP INTO THE COUNTRY TO ENGAGE A TEAM TO TAKE OUR BOAT UPON ITS LAST PORTAGE AFTER HAVING BEEN GRUFFLY REFUSED BY A CHURLISH FARMER WHO DOUBTLESS RECOGNIZED NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CANOEIST AND A TRAMP
7226-86965-0047 I STRUCK A BARGAIN WITH A NEGRO CULTIVATING A CORNFIELD WITH A SPAN OF COAL BLACK MULES AND IN HALF AN HOUR HE WAS AT THE FERRY LANDING WITH A WAGON WASHING OUT THE CANOE AND CHAINING IN THE OARS AND PADDLE WE LIFTED IT INTO THE WAGON BOX
7226-86965-0048 PILED OUR BAGGAGE ON TOP AND SET OFF OVER THE HILLS AND FIELDS TO COLOMA
7226-86965-0049 ANKLE DEEP IN MUD FOR THE LATE RAINS HAD WELL MOISTENED THE BLACK PRAIRIE SOIL IT WAS A UNIQUE AND PICTURESQUE PROCESSION
730-358-0000 CHAPTER ELEVEN IT IS WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY THAT I REMEMBER THE ORIGINAL ERA OF MY BEING
730-358-0001 BY DEGREES I REMEMBER A STRONGER LIGHT PRESSED UPON MY NERVES SO THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO SHUT MY EYES DARKNESS THEN CAME OVER ME AND TROUBLED ME BUT HARDLY HAD I FELT THIS WHEN BY OPENING MY EYES AS I NOW SUPPOSE
730-358-0002 THE LIGHT POURED IN UPON ME AGAIN I WALKED AND I BELIEVE DESCENDED BUT I PRESENTLY FOUND A GREAT ALTERATION IN MY SENSATIONS BEFORE DARK AND OPAQUE BODIES HAD SURROUNDED ME
730-358-0003 THE LIGHT BECAME MORE AND MORE OPPRESSIVE TO ME
730-358-0004 THIS WAS THE FOREST NEAR INGOLSTADT AND HERE I LAY BY THE SIDE OF A BROOK RESTING FROM MY FATIGUE UNTIL I FELT TORMENTED BY HUNGER AND THIRST THIS ROUSED ME FROM MY NEARLY DORMANT STATE
730-358-0005 I SLAKED MY THIRST AT THE BROOK AND THEN LYING DOWN WAS OVERCOME BY SLEEP IT WAS DARK WHEN I AWOKE I FELT COLD ALSO AND HALF FRIGHTENED
730-358-0006 AS IT WERE INSTINCTIVELY FINDING MYSELF SO DESOLATE
730-358-0007 I HAD COVERED MYSELF WITH SOME CLOTHES BUT THESE WERE INSUFFICIENT TO SECURE ME FROM THE DEWS OF NIGHT
730-358-0008 I KNEW AND COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING BUT FEELING PAIN INVADE ME ON ALL SIDES I SAT DOWN AND WEPT SOON A GENTLE LIGHT STOLE OVER THE HEAVENS AND GAVE ME A SENSATION OF PLEASURE
730-358-0009 THE MOON I GAZED WITH A KIND OF WONDER IT MOVED SLOWLY BUT IT ENLIGHTENED MY PATH AND I AGAIN WENT OUT IN SEARCH OF BERRIES I WAS STILL COLD WHEN UNDER ONE OF THE TREES I FOUND A HUGE CLOAK
730-358-0010 NO DISTINCT IDEAS OCCUPIED MY MIND ALL WAS CONFUSED I FELT LIGHT AND HUNGER AND THIRST AND DARKNESS INNUMERABLE SOUNDS RANG IN MY EARS AND ON ALL SIDES VARIOUS SCENTS SALUTED ME
730-358-0011 THE ONLY OBJECT THAT I COULD DISTINGUISH WAS THE BRIGHT MOON AND I FIXED MY EYES ON THAT WITH PLEASURE SEVERAL CHANGES OF DAY AND NIGHT PASSED AND THE ORB OF NIGHT HAD GREATLY LESSENED WHEN I BEGAN TO DISTINGUISH MY SENSATIONS FROM EACH OTHER
730-358-0012 I GRADUALLY SAW PLAINLY THE CLEAR STREAM THAT SUPPLIED ME WITH DRINK AND THE TREES THAT SHADED ME WITH THEIR FOLIAGE
730-358-0013 WHICH OFTEN SALUTED MY EARS PROCEEDED FROM THE THROATS OF THE LITTLE WINGED ANIMALS
730-358-0014 AND TO PERCEIVE THE BOUNDARIES OF THE RADIANT ROOF
730-358-0015 SOMETIMES I TRIED TO IMITATE THE PLEASANT SONGS OF THE BIRDS BUT WAS UNABLE SOMETIMES I WISHED TO EXPRESS MY SENSATIONS IN MY OWN MODE BUT THE UNCOUTH AND INARTICULATE SOUNDS WHICH BROKE FROM ME FRIGHTENED ME INTO SILENCE AGAIN
730-358-0016 THE MOON HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE NIGHT AND AGAIN WITH A LESSENED FORM SHOWED ITSELF WHILE I STILL REMAINED IN THE FOREST MY SENSATIONS HAD BY THIS TIME BECOME DISTINCT AND MY MIND RECEIVED EVERY DAY ADDITIONAL IDEAS
730-358-0017 MY EYES BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO THE LIGHT AND TO PERCEIVE OBJECTS IN THEIR RIGHT FORMS I DISTINGUISHED THE INSECT FROM THE HERB AND BY DEGREES ONE HERB FROM ANOTHER
730-358-0018 ONE DAY WHEN I WAS OPPRESSED BY COLD I FOUND A FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BY SOME WANDERING BEGGARS AND WAS OVERCOME WITH DELIGHT AT THE WARMTH I EXPERIENCED FROM IT
730-358-0019 IN MY JOY I THRUST MY HAND INTO THE LIVE EMBERS BUT QUICKLY DREW IT OUT AGAIN WITH A CRY OF PAIN HOW STRANGE I THOUGHT THAT THE SAME CAUSE SHOULD PRODUCE SUCH OPPOSITE EFFECTS I EXAMINED THE MATERIALS OF THE FIRE
730-358-0020 THE WET WOOD WHICH I HAD PLACED NEAR THE HEAT DRIED AND ITSELF BECAME INFLAMED I REFLECTED ON THIS AND BY TOUCHING THE VARIOUS BRANCHES
730-358-0021 AND THEN SPREADING MY CLOAK I LAY ON THE GROUND AND SANK INTO SLEEP IT WAS MORNING WHEN I AWOKE AND MY FIRST CARE WAS TO VISIT THE FIRE
730-358-0022 I OBSERVED THIS ALSO
730-358-0023 WHEN THEY WERE NEARLY EXTINGUISHED WHEN NIGHT CAME AGAIN I FOUND WITH PLEASURE THAT THE FIRE GAVE LIGHT AS WELL AS HEAT AND THAT THE DISCOVERY OF THIS ELEMENT WAS USEFUL TO ME IN MY FOOD
730-358-0024 AND TASTED MUCH MORE SAVOURY THAN THE BERRIES I GATHERED FROM THE TREES I TRIED THEREFORE TO DRESS MY FOOD IN THE SAME MANNER PLACING IT ON THE LIVE EMBERS
730-358-0025 AND THE NUTS AND ROOTS MUCH IMPROVED
730-358-0026 WHEN I FOUND THIS I RESOLVED TO QUIT THE PLACE THAT I HAD HITHERTO INHABITED TO SEEK FOR ONE WHERE THE FEW WANTS I EXPERIENCED
730-358-0027 AND KNEW NOT HOW TO REPRODUCE IT I GAVE SEVERAL HOURS TO THE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION OF THIS DIFFICULTY
730-358-0028 I STRUCK ACROSS THE WOOD TOWARDS THE SETTING SUN I PASSED THREE DAYS IN THESE RAMBLES AND AT LENGTH DISCOVERED THE OPEN COUNTRY A GREAT FALL OF SNOW HAD TAKEN PLACE THE NIGHT BEFORE
730-358-0029 THE APPEARANCE WAS DISCONSOLATE AND I FOUND MY FEET CHILLED BY THE COLD DAMP SUBSTANCE THAT COVERED THE GROUND IT WAS ABOUT SEVEN IN THE MORNING AND I LONGED TO OBTAIN FOOD AND SHELTER AT LENGTH I PERCEIVED A SMALL HUT
730-358-0030 THIS WAS A NEW SIGHT TO ME AND I EXAMINED THE STRUCTURE WITH GREAT CURIOSITY FINDING THE DOOR OPEN I ENTERED AN OLD MAN SAT IN IT NEAR A FIRE OVER WHICH HE WAS PREPARING HIS BREAKFAST HE TURNED ON HEARING A NOISE AND PERCEIVING ME SHRIEKED LOUDLY
730-358-0031 HIS APPEARANCE DIFFERENT FROM ANY I HAD EVER BEFORE SEEN AND HIS FLIGHT SOMEWHAT SURPRISED ME
730-358-0032 AFTER THEIR SUFFERINGS IN THE LAKE OF FIRE I GREEDILY DEVOURED THE REMNANTS OF THE SHEPHERD'S BREAKFAST WHICH CONSISTED OF BREAD CHEESE MILK AND WINE THE LATTER HOWEVER I DID NOT LIKE THEN OVERCOME
730-358-0033 I LAY DOWN AMONG SOME STRAW AND FELL ASLEEP
730-358-0034 WHICH SHONE BRIGHTLY ON THE WHITE GROUND
730-358-0035 I PROCEEDED ACROSS THE FIELDS FOR SEVERAL HOURS UNTIL AT SUNSET I ARRIVED AT A VILLAGE
730-358-0036 ALLURED MY APPETITE ONE OF THE BEST OF THESE I ENTERED BUT I HAD HARDLY PLACED MY FOOT WITHIN THE DOOR BEFORE THE CHILDREN SHRIEKED AND ONE OF THE WOMEN FAINTED THE WHOLE VILLAGE WAS ROUSED SOME FLED SOME ATTACKED ME
730-358-0037 REFUGE IN A LOW HOVEL QUITE BARE AND MAKING A WRETCHED APPEARANCE AFTER THE PALACES I HAD BEHELD IN THE VILLAGE THIS HOVEL HOWEVER JOINED A COTTAGE OF A NEAT AND PLEASANT APPEARANCE BUT AFTER MY LATE DEARLY BOUGHT EXPERIENCE I DARED NOT ENTER IT
730-358-0038 NO WOOD HOWEVER WAS PLACED ON THE EARTH WHICH FORMED THE FLOOR BUT IT WAS DRY AND ALTHOUGH THE WIND ENTERED IT BY INNUMERABLE CHINKS I FOUND IT AN AGREEABLE ASYLUM FROM THE SNOW AND RAIN
730-358-0039 HOWEVER MISERABLE FROM THE INCLEMENCY OF THE SEASON AND STILL MORE FROM THE BARBARITY OF MAN
730-358-0040 THAT I MIGHT VIEW THE ADJACENT COTTAGE
730-358-0041 ONE PART WAS OPEN AND BY THAT I HAD CREPT IN BUT NOW I COVERED EVERY CREVICE BY WHICH I MIGHT BE PERCEIVED WITH STONES AND WOOD
730-358-0042 ALL THE LIGHT I ENJOYED CAME THROUGH THE STY
730-358-0043 HAVING THUS ARRANGED MY DWELLING AND CARPETED IT WITH CLEAN STRAW I RETIRED FOR I SAW THE FIGURE OF A MAN AT A DISTANCE AND I REMEMBERED TOO WELL MY TREATMENT THE NIGHT BEFORE TO TRUST MYSELF IN HIS POWER
730-358-0044 BY A LOAF OF COARSE BREAD WHICH I PURLOINED AND A CUP
730-358-0045 WHICH FLOWED BY MY RETREAT THE FLOOR WAS A LITTLE RAISED SO THAT IT WAS KEPT PERFECTLY DRY AND BY ITS VICINITY TO THE CHIMNEY OF THE COTTAGE IT WAS TOLERABLY WARM
730-358-0046 THE RAIN DROPPING BRANCHES AND DANK EARTH I ATE MY BREAKFAST WITH PLEASURE AND WAS ABOUT TO REMOVE A PLANK TO PROCURE MYSELF A LITTLE WATER WHEN I HEARD A STEP AND LOOKING THROUGH A SMALL CHINK I BEHELD A YOUNG CREATURE
730-358-0047 WITH A PAIL ON HER HEAD PASSING BEFORE MY HOVEL THE GIRL WAS YOUNG AND OF GENTLE DEMEANOUR
730-358-0048 HER FAIR HAIR WAS PLAITED BUT NOT ADORNED SHE LOOKED PATIENT YET SAD
730-358-0049 AND IN ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE RETURNED BEARING THE PAIL WHICH WAS NOW PARTLY FILLED WITH MILK AS SHE WALKED ALONG
730-358-0050 PRESENTLY I SAW THE YOUNG MAN AGAIN WITH SOME TOOLS IN HIS HAND CROSS THE FIELD BEHIND THE COTTAGE
730-358-0051 ON EXAMINING MY DWELLING I FOUND THAT ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF THE COTTAGE HAD FORMERLY OCCUPIED A PART OF IT BUT THE PANES HAD BEEN FILLED UP WITH WOOD IN ONE OF THESE WAS A SMALL AND ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE CHINK THROUGH WHICH THE EYE COULD JUST PENETRATE
730-358-0052 WHITEWASHED AND CLEAN BUT VERY BARE OF FURNITURE IN ONE CORNER NEAR A SMALL FIRE SAT AN OLD MAN LEANING HIS HEAD ON HIS HANDS IN A DISCONSOLATE ATTITUDE THE YOUNG GIRL WAS OCCUPIED IN ARRANGING THE COTTAGE BUT PRESENTLY
730-358-0053 WHO TAKING UP AN INSTRUMENT BEGAN TO PLAY AND TO PRODUCE SOUNDS SWEETER THAN THE VOICE OF THE THRUSH OR THE NIGHTINGALE IT WAS A LOVELY SIGHT
730-358-0054 THE SILVER HAIR AND BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE OF THE AGED COTTAGER
730-358-0055 HE RAISED HER AND SMILED WITH SUCH KINDNESS AND AFFECTION THAT I FELT SENSATIONS OF A PECULIAR AND OVERPOWERING NATURE
730-358-0056 AND I WITHDREW FROM THE WINDOW UNABLE TO BEAR THESE EMOTIONS
730-358-0057 BEARING ON HIS SHOULDERS A LOAD OF WOOD THE GIRL MET HIM AT THE DOOR HELPED TO RELIEVE HIM OF HIS BURDEN AND TAKING SOME OF THE FUEL INTO THE COTTAGE PLACED IT ON THE FIRE THEN SHE AND THE YOUTH WENT APART INTO A NOOK OF THE COTTAGE
730-358-0058 AND HE SHOWED HER A LARGE LOAF AND A PIECE OF CHEESE SHE SEEMED PLEASED AND WENT INTO THE GARDEN FOR SOME ROOTS AND PLANTS WHICH SHE PLACED IN WATER AND THEN UPON THE FIRE
730-358-0059 AND APPEARED BUSILY EMPLOYED IN DIGGING AND PULLING UP ROOTS
730-358-0060 THE OLD MAN HAD IN THE MEANTIME BEEN PENSIVE BUT ON THE APPEARANCE OF HIS COMPANIONS
730-358-0061 THE MEAL WAS QUICKLY DISPATCHED THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS AGAIN OCCUPIED IN ARRANGING THE COTTAGE THE OLD MAN WALKED BEFORE THE COTTAGE IN THE SUN FOR A FEW MINUTES LEANING ON THE ARM OF THE YOUTH NOTHING COULD EXCEED IN BEAUTY THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THESE TWO EXCELLENT CREATURES
730-358-0062 BUT TO MY EXTREME WONDER
730-358-0063 DID NOT PUT AN END TO THE PLEASURE I EXPERIENCED IN WATCHING MY HUMAN NEIGHBOURS
730-358-0064 THE YOUTH BEGAN NOT TO PLAY BUT TO UTTER SOUNDS THAT WERE MONOTONOUS AND NEITHER RESEMBLING THE HARMONY OF THE OLD MAN'S INSTRUMENT NOR THE SONGS OF THE BIRDS
730-359-0000 I LAY ON MY STRAW BUT I COULD NOT SLEEP I THOUGHT OF THE OCCURRENCES OF THE DAY WHAT CHIEFLY STRUCK ME WAS THE GENTLE MANNERS OF THESE PEOPLE AND I LONGED TO JOIN THEM BUT DARED NOT
730-359-0001 WHICH INFLUENCED THEIR ACTIONS THE COTTAGERS AROSE THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE SUN THE YOUNG WOMAN ARRANGED THE COTTAGE AND PREPARED THE FOOD AND THE YOUTH DEPARTED AFTER THE FIRST MEAL
730-359-0002 THIS DAY WAS PASSED IN THE SAME ROUTINE AS THAT WHICH PRECEDED IT THE YOUNG MAN WAS CONSTANTLY EMPLOYED OUT OF DOORS AND THE GIRL IN VARIOUS LABORIOUS OCCUPATIONS WITHIN THE OLD MAN WHOM I SOON PERCEIVED TO BE BLIND
730-359-0003 EMPLOYED HIS LEISURE HOURS ON HIS INSTRUMENT OR IN CONTEMPLATION NOTHING COULD EXCEED THE LOVE AND RESPECT WHICH THE YOUNGER COTTAGERS EXHIBITED TOWARDS THEIR VENERABLE COMPANION
730-359-0004 AND DUTY WITH GENTLENESS AND HE REWARDED THEM
730-359-0005 THEY WERE NOT ENTIRELY HAPPY THE YOUNG MAN AND HIS COMPANION OFTEN WENT APART AND APPEARED TO WEEP I SAW NO CAUSE FOR THEIR UNHAPPINESS BUT I WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED BY IT IF SUCH LOVELY CREATURES WERE MISERABLE
730-359-0006 IT WAS LESS STRANGE THAT I AN IMPERFECT AND SOLITARY BEING SHOULD BE WRETCHED YET WHY WERE THESE GENTLE BEINGS UNHAPPY
730-359-0007 THEY WERE DRESSED IN EXCELLENT CLOTHES AND STILL MORE THEY ENJOYED ONE ANOTHER'S COMPANY AND SPEECH INTERCHANGING EACH DAY LOOKS OF AFFECTION AND KINDNESS WHAT DID THEIR TEARS IMPLY
730-359-0008 A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD ELAPSED
730-359-0009 IT WAS POVERTY AND THEY SUFFERED THAT EVIL IN A VERY DISTRESSING DEGREE THEIR NOURISHMENT CONSISTED ENTIRELY OF THE VEGETABLES OF THEIR GARDEN AND THE MILK OF ONE COW WHICH GAVE VERY LITTLE DURING THE WINTER
730-359-0010 WHEN ITS MASTERS COULD SCARCELY PROCURE FOOD TO SUPPORT IT THEY OFTEN I BELIEVE SUFFERED THE PANGS OF HUNGER VERY POIGNANTLY ESPECIALLY THE TWO YOUNGER COTTAGERS FOR SEVERAL TIMES THEY PLACED FOOD BEFORE THE OLD MAN WHEN THEY RESERVED NONE FOR THEMSELVES
730-359-0011 THIS TRAIT OF KINDNESS MOVED ME SENSIBLY I HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED DURING THE NIGHT TO STEAL A PART OF THEIR STORE FOR MY OWN CONSUMPTION
730-359-0012 I ABSTAINED AND SATISFIED MYSELF WITH BERRIES NUTS AND ROOTS WHICH I GATHERED FROM A NEIGHBOURING WOOD
730-359-0013 AND BROUGHT HOME FIRING SUFFICIENT FOR THE CONSUMPTION OF SEVERAL DAYS
730-359-0014 THE YOUNG WOMAN WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR IN THE MORNING
730-359-0015 SHE UTTERED SOME WORDS IN A LOUD VOICE AND THE YOUTH JOINED HER WHO ALSO EXPRESSED SURPRISE I OBSERVED WITH PLEASURE THAT HE DID NOT GO TO THE FOREST THAT DAY BUT SPENT IT IN REPAIRING THE COTTAGE AND CULTIVATING THE GARDEN
730-359-0016 BY DEGREES I MADE A DISCOVERY OF STILL GREATER MOMENT I FOUND THAT THESE PEOPLE POSSESSED A METHOD OF COMMUNICATING THEIR EXPERIENCE AND FEELINGS TO ONE ANOTHER BY ARTICULATE SOUNDS
730-359-0017 I PERCEIVED THAT THE WORDS THEY SPOKE SOMETIMES PRODUCED PLEASURE OR PAIN SMILES OR SADNESS IN THE MINDS AND COUNTENANCES OF THE HEARERS THIS WAS INDEED A GODLIKE SCIENCE AND I ARDENTLY DESIRED TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH IT
730-359-0018 BUT I WAS BAFFLED IN EVERY ATTEMPT I MADE FOR THIS PURPOSE
730-359-0019 NOT HAVING ANY APPARENT CONNECTION WITH VISIBLE OBJECTS I WAS UNABLE TO DISCOVER ANY CLUE BY WHICH I COULD UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY OF THEIR REFERENCE BY GREAT APPLICATION HOWEVER
730-359-0020 AND AFTER HAVING REMAINED DURING THE SPACE OF SEVERAL REVOLUTIONS OF THE MOON IN MY HOVEL I DISCOVERED THE NAMES THAT WERE GIVEN TO SOME OF THE MOST FAMILIAR OBJECTS OF DISCOURSE I LEARNED AND APPLIED THE WORDS FIRE MILK BREAD AND WOOD
730-359-0021 BUT THE OLD MAN HAD ONLY ONE WHICH WAS FATHER THE GIRL WAS CALLED SISTER OR AGATHA AND THE YOUTH FELIX BROTHER OR SON I CANNOT DESCRIBE THE DELIGHT I FELT
730-359-0022 WHEN I LEARNED THE IDEAS APPROPRIATED TO EACH OF THESE SOUNDS AND WAS ABLE TO PRONOUNCE THEM
730-359-0023 AS YET TO UNDERSTAND OR APPLY THEM SUCH AS GOOD DEAREST UNHAPPY I SPENT THE WINTER IN THIS MANNER THE GENTLE MANNERS AND BEAUTY OF THE COTTAGERS GREATLY ENDEARED THEM TO ME
730-359-0024 WHEN THEY WERE UNHAPPY I FELT DEPRESSED WHEN THEY REJOICED I SYMPATHIZED IN THEIR JOYS
730-359-0025 OFTEN ENDEAVOURED TO ENCOURAGE HIS CHILDREN AS SOMETIMES I FOUND THAT HE CALLED THEM TO CAST OFF THEIR MELANCHOLY
730-359-0026 AGATHA LISTENED WITH RESPECT HER EYES SOMETIMES FILLED WITH TEARS WHICH SHE ENDEAVOURED TO WIPE AWAY UNPERCEIVED
730-359-0027 AND TONE WERE MORE CHEERFUL AFTER HAVING LISTENED TO THE EXHORTATIONS OF HER FATHER IT WAS NOT THUS WITH FELIX HE WAS ALWAYS THE SADDEST OF THE GROUP AND EVEN TO MY UNPRACTISED SENSES HE APPEARED TO HAVE SUFFERED MORE DEEPLY THAN HIS FRIENDS
730-359-0028 BUT IF HIS COUNTENANCE WAS MORE SORROWFUL
730-359-0029 ESPECIALLY WHEN HE ADDRESSED THE OLD MAN I COULD MENTION INNUMERABLE INSTANCES WHICH ALTHOUGH SLIGHT
730-359-0030 IN THE MIDST OF POVERTY AND WANT
730-359-0031 FROM BENEATH THE SNOWY GROUND EARLY IN THE MORNING BEFORE SHE HAD RISEN
730-359-0032 WHERE TO HIS PERPETUAL ASTONISHMENT HE FOUND HIS STORE ALWAYS REPLENISHED BY AN INVISIBLE HAND IN THE DAY I BELIEVE HE WORKED SOMETIMES FOR A NEIGHBOURING FARMER BECAUSE HE OFTEN WENT FORTH AND DID NOT RETURN UNTIL DINNER YET BROUGHT NO WOOD WITH HIM
730-359-0033 HE READ TO THE OLD MAN AND AGATHA THIS READING HAD PUZZLED ME EXTREMELY AT FIRST BUT BY DEGREES I DISCOVERED THAT HE UTTERED MANY OF THE SAME SOUNDS WHEN HE READ AS WHEN HE TALKED I CONJECTURED THEREFORE
730-359-0034 THAT HE FOUND ON THE PAPER SIGNS FOR SPEECH WHICH HE UNDERSTOOD AND I ARDENTLY LONGED TO COMPREHEND THESE ALSO BUT HOW WAS THAT POSSIBLE WHEN I DID NOT EVEN UNDERSTAND THE SOUNDS FOR WHICH THEY STOOD AS SIGNS I IMPROVED HOWEVER SENSIBLY IN THIS SCIENCE
730-359-0035 OF CONVERSATION ALTHOUGH I APPLIED MY WHOLE MIND TO THE ENDEAVOUR
730-359-0036 TO DISCOVER MYSELF TO THE COTTAGERS
730-359-0037 WHICH KNOWLEDGE MIGHT ENABLE ME TO MAKE THEM OVERLOOK THE DEFORMITY OF MY FIGURE
730-359-0038 AS THE SUN BECAME WARMER AND THE LIGHT OF DAY LONGER
730-359-0039 FROM THIS TIME FELIX WAS MORE EMPLOYED AND THE HEART MOVING INDICATIONS OF IMPENDING FAMINE DISAPPEARED
730-359-0040 AND THEY PROCURED A SUFFICIENCY OF IT SEVERAL NEW KINDS OF PLANTS SPRANG UP IN THE GARDEN WHICH THEY DRESSED AND THESE SIGNS OF COMFORT INCREASED DAILY AS THE SEASON ADVANCED THE OLD MAN LEANING ON HIS SON
730-359-0041 MY MODE OF LIFE IN MY HOVEL WAS UNIFORM DURING THE MORNING I ATTENDED THE MOTIONS OF THE COTTAGERS AND WHEN THEY WERE DISPERSED IN VARIOUS OCCUPATIONS I SLEPT THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY WAS SPENT IN OBSERVING MY FRIENDS
730-359-0042 WHEN THEY HAD RETIRED TO REST IF THERE WAS ANY MOON OR THE NIGHT WAS STAR LIGHT
730-359-0043 AND ONCE OR TWICE I HEARD THEM ON THESE OCCASIONS UTTER THE WORDS GOOD SPIRIT WONDERFUL
730-359-0044 MY THOUGHTS NOW BECAME MORE ACTIVE AND I LONGED TO DISCOVER THE MOTIVES AND FEELINGS OF THESE LOVELY CREATURES I WAS INQUISITIVE TO KNOW WHY FELIX APPEARED SO MISERABLE AND AGATHA SO SAD I THOUGHT FOOLISH WRETCH
730-359-0045 THAT IT MIGHT BE IN MY POWER TO RESTORE HAPPINESS TO THESE DESERVING PEOPLE WHEN I SLEPT OR WAS ABSENT THE FORMS OF THE VENERABLE BLIND FATHER
730-359-0046 I IMAGINED THAT THEY WOULD BE DISGUSTED UNTIL
730-359-0047 AND LED ME TO APPLY WITH FRESH ARDOUR TO THE ACQUIRING THE ART OF LANGUAGE MY ORGANS WERE INDEED HARSH BUT SUPPLE AND ALTHOUGH MY VOICE WAS VERY UNLIKE THE SOFT MUSIC OF THEIR TONES YET I PRONOUNCED SUCH WORDS AS I UNDERSTOOD WITH TOLERABLE EASE
730-359-0048 GREATLY ALTERED THE ASPECT OF THE EARTH MEN WHO BEFORE THIS CHANGE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN HID IN CAVES DISPERSED THEMSELVES AND WERE EMPLOYED IN VARIOUS ARTS OF CULTIVATION
730-359-0049 HAPPY HAPPY EARTH FIT HABITATION FOR GODS WHICH SO SHORT A TIME BEFORE
730-359-0050 MY SPIRITS WERE ELEVATED BY THE ENCHANTING APPEARANCE OF NATURE
730-360-0000 I NOW HASTEN TO THE MORE MOVING PART OF MY STORY I SHALL RELATE EVENTS THAT IMPRESSED ME WITH FEELINGS WHICH FROM WHAT I HAD BEEN HAVE MADE ME WHAT I AM
730-360-0001 IT SURPRISED ME THAT WHAT BEFORE WAS DESERT AND GLOOMY SHOULD NOW BLOOM WITH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS AND VERDURE
730-360-0002 MY SENSES WERE GRATIFIED AND REFRESHED BY A THOUSAND SCENTS OF DELIGHT AND A THOUSAND SIGHTS OF BEAUTY IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE DAYS WHEN MY COTTAGERS PERIODICALLY RESTED FROM LABOUR THE OLD MAN PLAYED ON HIS GUITAR
730-360-0003 THAT I OBSERVED THE COUNTENANCE OF FELIX WAS MELANCHOLY BEYOND EXPRESSION HE SIGHED FREQUENTLY AND ONCE HIS FATHER PAUSED IN HIS MUSIC AND I CONJECTURED
730-360-0004 THAT HE INQUIRED THE CAUSE OF HIS SON'S SORROW FELIX REPLIED IN A CHEERFUL ACCENT AND THE OLD MAN WAS RECOMMENCING HIS MUSIC WHEN SOMEONE TAPPED AT THE DOOR IT WAS A LADY ON HORSEBACK ACCOMPANIED BY A COUNTRY MAN AS A GUIDE
730-360-0005 THE LADY WAS DRESSED IN A DARK SUIT AND COVERED WITH A THICK BLACK VEIL AGATHA ASKED A QUESTION TO WHICH THE STRANGER ONLY REPLIED BY PRONOUNCING IN A SWEET ACCENT THE NAME OF FELIX
730-360-0006 ON HEARING THIS WORD FELIX CAME UP HASTILY TO THE LADY WHO WHEN SHE SAW HIM THREW UP HER VEIL
730-360-0007 AND HER COMPLEXION WONDROUSLY FAIR
730-360-0008 EVERY TRAIT OF SORROW VANISHED FROM HIS FACE AND IT INSTANTLY EXPRESSED A DEGREE OF ECSTATIC JOY OF WHICH I COULD HARDLY HAVE BELIEVED IT CAPABLE
730-360-0009 SHE APPEARED AFFECTED BY DIFFERENT FEELINGS WIPING A FEW TEARS FROM HER LOVELY EYES
730-360-0010 SHE DID NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND HIM BUT SMILED HE ASSISTED HER TO DISMOUNT AND DISMISSING HER GUIDE CONDUCTED HER INTO THE COTTAGE
730-360-0011 AND WOULD HAVE KISSED HIS HAND BUT HE RAISED HER AND EMBRACED HER AFFECTIONATELY
730-360-0012 SHE WAS NEITHER UNDERSTOOD BY NOR HERSELF UNDERSTOOD THE COTTAGERS THEY MADE MANY SIGNS WHICH I DID NOT COMPREHEND BUT I SAW THAT HER PRESENCE DIFFUSED GLADNESS THROUGH THE COTTAGE DISPELLING THEIR SORROW AS THE SUN DISSIPATES THE MORNING MISTS
730-360-0013 AND POINTING TO HER BROTHER MADE SIGNS WHICH APPEARED TO ME TO MEAN THAT HE HAD BEEN SORROWFUL UNTIL SHE CAME SOME HOURS PASSED THUS WHILE THEY BY THEIR COUNTENANCES EXPRESSED JOY THE CAUSE OF WHICH I DID NOT COMPREHEND
730-360-0014 PRESENTLY I FOUND BY THE FREQUENT RECURRENCE OF SOME SOUND WHICH THE STRANGER REPEATED AFTER THEM THAT SHE WAS ENDEAVOURING TO LEARN THEIR LANGUAGE AND THE IDEA INSTANTLY OCCURRED TO ME THAT I SHOULD MAKE USE OF THE SAME INSTRUCTIONS TO THE SAME END
730-360-0015 RETIRED EARLY WHEN THEY SEPARATED FELIX KISSED THE HAND OF THE STRANGER AND SAID GOOD NIGHT SWEET SAFIE HE SAT UP MUCH LONGER CONVERSING WITH HIS FATHER AND BY THE FREQUENT REPETITION OF HER NAME I CONJECTURED THAT THEIR LOVELY GUEST
730-360-0016 WAS THE SUBJECT OF THEIR CONVERSATION I ARDENTLY DESIRED TO UNDERSTAND THEM AND BENT EVERY FACULTY TOWARDS THAT PURPOSE BUT FOUND IT UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE THE NEXT MORNING FELIX WENT OUT TO HIS WORK
730-360-0017 AND AFTER THE USUAL OCCUPATIONS OF AGATHA WERE FINISHED THE ARABIAN SAT AT THE FEET OF THE OLD MAN AND TAKING HIS GUITAR PLAYED SOME AIRS SO ENTRANCINGLY BEAUTIFUL THAT THEY AT ONCE DREW TEARS OF SORROW AND DELIGHT FROM MY EYES
730-360-0018 WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED SHE GAVE THE GUITAR TO AGATHA WHO AT FIRST DECLINED IT SHE PLAYED A SIMPLE AIR AND HER VOICE ACCOMPANIED IT IN SWEET ACCENTS BUT UNLIKE THE WONDROUS STRAIN OF THE STRANGER
730-360-0019 THE OLD MAN APPEARED ENRAPTURED AND SAID SOME WORDS WHICH AGATHA ENDEAVOURED TO EXPLAIN TO SAFIE AND BY WHICH HE APPEARED TO WISH TO EXPRESS THAT SHE BESTOWED ON HIM THE GREATEST DELIGHT BY HER MUSIC
730-360-0020 THE DAYS NOW PASSED AS PEACEABLY AS BEFORE WITH THE SOLE ALTERATION THAT
730-360-0021 IN THE COUNTENANCES OF MY FRIENDS SAFIE WAS ALWAYS GAY AND HAPPY SHE AND I IMPROVED RAPIDLY IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF LANGUAGE SO THAT IN TWO MONTHS I BEGAN TO COMPREHEND MOST OF THE WORDS UTTERED BY MY PROTECTORS
730-360-0022 IN THE MEANWHILE ALSO THE BLACK GROUND WAS COVERED WITH HERBAGE AND THE GREEN BANKS INTERSPERSED WITH INNUMERABLE FLOWERS SWEET TO THE SCENT AND THE EYES STARS OF PALE RADIANCE AMONG THE MOONLIGHT WOODS THE SUN BECAME WARMER THE NIGHTS CLEAR AND BALMY
730-360-0023 ALTHOUGH THEY WERE CONSIDERABLY SHORTENED BY THE LATE SETTING AND EARLY RISING OF THE SUN FOR I NEVER VENTURED ABROAD DURING DAYLIGHT
730-360-0024 MY DAYS WERE SPENT IN CLOSE ATTENTION THAT I MIGHT MORE SPEEDILY MASTER THE LANGUAGE AND I MAY BOAST
730-360-0025 WHO UNDERSTOOD VERY LITTLE AND CONVERSED IN BROKEN ACCENTS WHILST I COMPREHENDED AND COULD IMITATE ALMOST EVERY WORD THAT WAS SPOKEN WHILE I IMPROVED IN SPEECH I ALSO LEARNED THE SCIENCE OF LETTERS AS IT WAS TAUGHT TO THE STRANGER AND THIS OPENED BEFORE ME
730-360-0026 THE BOOK FROM WHICH FELIX INSTRUCTED SAFIE WAS VOLNEY'S RUINS OF EMPIRES I SHOULD NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE PURPORT OF THIS BOOK HAD NOT FELIX IN READING IT
730-360-0027 HE HAD CHOSEN THIS WORK HE SAID BECAUSE THE DECLAMATORY STYLE WAS FRAMED IN IMITATION OF THE EASTERN AUTHORS
730-360-0028 AND A VIEW OF THE SEVERAL EMPIRES AT PRESENT EXISTING IN THE WORLD IT GAVE ME AN INSIGHT INTO THE MANNERS GOVERNMENTS AND RELIGIONS OF THE DIFFERENT NATIONS OF THE EARTH
730-360-0029 DEGENERATING OF THE DECLINE OF THAT MIGHTY EMPIRE OF CHIVALRY CHRISTIANITY AND KINGS I HEARD OF THE DISCOVERY OF THE AMERICAN HEMISPHERE
730-360-0030 INHABITANTS THESE WONDERFUL NARRATIONS INSPIRED ME WITH STRANGE FEELINGS WAS MAN INDEED AT ONCE SO POWERFUL SO VIRTUOUS AND MAGNIFICENT YET SO VICIOUS AND BASE
730-360-0031 AND AT ANOTHER AS ALL THAT CAN BE CONCEIVED OF NOBLE AND GODLIKE TO BE A GREAT AND VIRTUOUS MAN APPEARED THE HIGHEST HONOUR THAT CAN BEFALL A SENSITIVE BEING TO BE BASE AND VICIOUS AS MANY ON RECORD HAVE BEEN APPEARED
730-360-0032 A CONDITION MORE ABJECT THAN THAT
730-360-0033 OR EVEN WHY THERE WERE LAWS AND GOVERNMENTS BUT WHEN I HEARD DETAILS OF VICE AND BLOODSHED MY WONDER CEASED AND I TURNED AWAY WITH DISGUST AND LOATHING EVERY CONVERSATION OF THE COTTAGERS NOW OPENED NEW WONDERS TO ME
730-360-0034 I HEARD OF THE DIVISION OF PROPERTY OF IMMENSE WEALTH AND SQUALID POVERTY OF RANK DESCENT AND NOBLE BLOOD
730-360-0035 UNITED WITH RICHES A MAN MIGHT BE RESPECTED WITH ONLY ONE OF THESE ADVANTAGES BUT WITHOUT EITHER HE WAS CONSIDERED EXCEPT IN VERY RARE INSTANCES AS A VAGABOND AND A SLAVE DOOMED TO WASTE HIS POWERS FOR THE PROFITS OF THE CHOSEN FEW
730-360-0036 AND WHAT WAS I OF MY CREATION AND CREATOR I WAS ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT BUT I KNEW THAT I POSSESSED NO MONEY NO FRIENDS NO KIND OF PROPERTY
730-360-0037 SENSATIONS OF HUNGER THIRST AND HEAT OF WHAT A STRANGE NATURE IS KNOWLEDGE
730-360-0038 AND THAT WAS DEATH A STATE WHICH I FEARED YET DID NOT UNDERSTAND
730-360-0039 EXCEPT THROUGH MEANS WHICH I OBTAINED BY STEALTH
730-360-0040 MISERABLE UNHAPPY WRETCH OTHER LESSONS WERE IMPRESSED UPON ME EVEN MORE DEEPLY
730-360-0041 HOW THE FATHER DOTED ON THE SMILES OF THE INFANT
730-360-0042 NO MOTHER HAD BLESSED ME WITH SMILES AND CARESSES
730-360-0043 ALL MY PAST LIFE WAS NOW A BLOT A BLIND VACANCY IN WHICH I DISTINGUISHED NOTHING FROM MY EARLIEST REMEMBRANCE I HAD BEEN AS I THEN WAS IN HEIGHT AND PROPORTION
730-360-0044 I HAD NEVER YET SEEN A BEING RESEMBLING ME OR WHO CLAIMED ANY INTERCOURSE WITH ME WHAT WAS I
7302-86814-0000 IN THEIR EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE HAVE NAMED IT THE LIONS DEN PROBABLY BECAUSE THE CAPTIVES POSSESS TEETH WHICH FREQUENTLY GNAW THE BARS AND SOMETIMES THE KEEPERS ALSO IT IS A PRISON WITHIN A PRISON
7302-86814-0001 THE WALLS ARE DOUBLE THE THICKNESS OF THE REST THE GRATINGS ARE EVERY DAY CAREFULLY EXAMINED BY JAILERS WHOSE HERCULEAN PROPORTIONS AND COLD PITILESS EXPRESSION
7302-86814-0002 PROVE THEM TO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN TO REIGN OVER THEIR SUBJECTS FOR THEIR SUPERIOR ACTIVITY AND INTELLIGENCE THE COURT YARD OF THIS QUARTER IS ENCLOSED BY ENORMOUS WALLS OVER WHICH THE SUN GLANCES OBLIQUELY
7302-86814-0003 WHEN IT DEIGNS TO PENETRATE INTO THIS GULF OF MORAL AND PHYSICAL DEFORMITY ON THIS PAVED YARD ARE TO BE SEEN PACING TO AND FRO FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT PALE CAREWORN AND HAGGARD LIKE SO MANY SHADOWS
7302-86814-0004 THE MEN WHOM JUSTICE HOLDS BENEATH THE STEEL SHE IS SHARPENING THERE CROUCHED AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE WALL WHICH ATTRACTS AND RETAINS THE MOST HEAT THEY MAY BE SEEN SOMETIMES TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER BUT MORE FREQUENTLY ALONE
7302-86814-0005 WATCHING THE DOOR WHICH SOMETIMES OPENS TO CALL FORTH ONE FROM THE GLOOMY ASSEMBLAGE OR TO THROW IN ANOTHER OUTCAST FROM SOCIETY THE COURT OF SAINT BERNARD HAS ITS OWN PARTICULAR APARTMENT
7302-86814-0006 IT IS A WRETCHED DAMP NAY EVEN HORRIBLE SPOT MORE ESPECIALLY WHEN WE CONSIDER THE AGONIZING CONFERENCES WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN THOSE IRON BARS AND YET FRIGHTFUL THOUGH THIS SPOT MAY BE
7302-86814-0007 IT IS LOOKED UPON AS A KIND OF PARADISE BY THE MEN WHOSE DAYS ARE NUMBERED IT IS SO RARE FOR THEM TO LEAVE THE LIONS DEN FOR ANY OTHER PLACE THAN THE BARRIER SAINT JACQUES OR THE GALLEYS
7302-86814-0008 SOON RECOVERED ITS GLOSS IN THE PARTS WHICH WERE STILL PERFECT FOR THE WEARER TRIED HIS BEST TO MAKE IT ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF A NEW COAT HE BESTOWED THE SAME ATTENTION UPON THE CAMBRIC FRONT OF A SHIRT WHICH HAD CONSIDERABLY CHANGED IN COLOR
7302-86814-0009 WERE WATCHING THE OPERATIONS OF THE PRISONER'S TOILET WITH CONSIDERABLE INTEREST SEE THE PRINCE IS PLUMING HIMSELF SAID ONE OF THE THIEVES HE'S A FINE LOOKING FELLOW SAID ANOTHER
7302-86814-0010 HIS COAT LOOKS ALMOST NEW AND HIS BOOTS SHINE LIKE A NIGGER'S FACE IT'S PLEASANT TO HAVE SUCH WELL DRESSED COMRADES BUT DIDN'T THOSE GENDARMES BEHAVE SHAMEFUL MUST A BEEN JEALOUS TO TEAR SUCH CLOTHES
7302-86814-0011 HE LOOKS LIKE A BIG BUG SAID ANOTHER DRESSES IN FINE STYLE AND THEN TO BE HERE SO YOUNG OH WHAT LARKS MEANWHILE THE OBJECT OF THIS HIDEOUS ADMIRATION APPROACHED THE WICKET
7302-86814-0012 AGAINST WHICH ONE OF THE KEEPERS WAS LEANING COME SIR HE SAID LEND ME TWENTY FRANCS YOU WILL SOON BE PAID YOU RUN NO RISKS WITH ME REMEMBER I HAVE RELATIONS WHO POSSESS MORE MILLIONS
7302-86814-0013 COME I BESEECH YOU LEND ME TWENTY FRANCS SO THAT I MAY BUY A DRESSING GOWN IT IS INTOLERABLE ALWAYS TO BE IN A COAT AND BOOTS AND WHAT A COAT SIR FOR A PRINCE OF THE CAVALCANTI
7302-86814-0014 YOU ARE A MAN VOID OF COMPASSION I'LL HAVE YOU TURNED OUT THIS MADE THE KEEPER TURN AROUND AND HE BURST INTO A LOUD LAUGH THE PRISONERS THEN APPROACHED AND FORMED A CIRCLE
7302-86814-0015 THE LATTER SURE OF QUELLING THE TEMPEST WHEN THE WAVES BECAME TOO VIOLENT ALLOWED THEM TO RISE TO A CERTAIN PITCH THAT HE MIGHT BE REVENGED ON THE IMPORTUNATE ANDREA AND BESIDES IT WOULD AFFORD HIM SOME RECREATION DURING THE LONG DAY
7302-86814-0016 THE THIEVES HAD ALREADY APPROACHED ANDREA SOME SCREAMING
7302-86814-0017 ANOTHER KIND OF RECREATION IN WHICH A HANDKERCHIEF IS FILLED WITH SAND PEBBLES
7302-86814-0018 ROLLED HIS TONGUE AROUND HIS CHEEKS AND SMACKED HIS LIPS IN A MANNER EQUIVALENT TO A HUNDRED WORDS AMONG THE BANDITS WHEN FORCED TO BE SILENT IT WAS A MASONIC SIGN CADEROUSSE HAD TAUGHT HIM
7302-86814-0019 HE WAS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THEM THE HANDKERCHIEF WAS THROWN DOWN AND THE IRON HEELED SHOE REPLACED ON THE FOOT OF THE WRETCH TO WHOM IT BELONGED SOME VOICES WERE HEARD TO SAY THAT THE GENTLEMAN WAS RIGHT
7302-86814-0020 THAT HE INTENDED TO BE CIVIL IN HIS WAY AND THAT THEY WOULD SET THE EXAMPLE OF LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE AND THE MOB RETIRED THE KEEPER WAS SO STUPEFIED AT THIS SCENE THAT HE TOOK ANDREA BY THE HANDS
7302-86814-0021 SAID THE SAME VOICE YOU SEE SOME ONE PAYS ME A VISIT AH MY DEAR SIR YOU WILL SEE WHETHER A CAVALCANTI IS TO BE TREATED LIKE A COMMON PERSON
7302-86814-0022 PROVES ME TO BE UNDER THE PROTECTION OF SOME POWERFUL PERSON THIS SUDDEN FORTUNE THE FACILITY WITH WHICH I HAVE OVERCOME ALL OBSTACLES AN UNEXPECTED FAMILY AND AN ILLUSTRIOUS NAME AWARDED TO ME
7302-86814-0023 GOLD SHOWERED DOWN UPON ME AND THE MOST SPLENDID ALLIANCES ABOUT TO BE ENTERED INTO AN UNHAPPY LAPSE OF FORTUNE AND THE ABSENCE OF MY PROTECTOR HAVE CAST ME DOWN CERTAINLY BUT NOT FOREVER
7302-86814-0024 THE HAND WHICH HAS RETREATED FOR A WHILE WILL BE AGAIN STRETCHED FORTH TO SAVE ME AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN I SHALL THINK MYSELF SINKING INTO THE ABYSS WHY SHOULD I RISK AN IMPRUDENT STEP IT MIGHT ALIENATE MY PROTECTOR
7302-86814-0025 UPON THE IRON BARS THE BOLTED DOORS AND THE SHADOW WHICH MOVED BEHIND THE OTHER GRATING
7302-86814-0026 SAID ANDREA DEEPLY AFFECTED GOOD MORNING BENEDETTO
7302-86814-0027 WITH HIS DEEP HOLLOW VOICE YOU YOU SAID THE YOUNG MAN LOOKING FEARFULLY AROUND HIM DO YOU NOT RECOGNIZE ME UNHAPPY CHILD SILENCE
7302-86814-0028 YOU WISH TO SPEAK WITH ME ALONE DO YOU NOT
7302-86814-0029 OH YES THAT IS WELL
7302-86814-0030 THEN HE MENTALLY ADDED STILL MY UNKNOWN PROTECTOR I AM NOT FORGOTTEN THEY WISH FOR SECRECY SINCE WE ARE TO CONVERSE IN A PRIVATE ROOM I UNDERSTAND
7302-86814-0031 THE KEEPER SPOKE FOR A MOMENT WITH AN OFFICIAL
7302-86814-0032 THE ROOM WAS WHITEWASHED AS IS THE CUSTOM IN PRISONS BUT IT LOOKED QUITE BRILLIANT TO A PRISONER THOUGH A STOVE A BED A CHAIR AND A TABLE FORMED THE WHOLE OF ITS SUMPTUOUS FURNITURE
7302-86814-0033 ANDREA THREW HIMSELF UPON THE BED THE KEEPER RETIRED NOW SAID THE STEWARD WHAT HAVE YOU TO TELL ME AND YOU
7302-86814-0034 YOU SPEAK FIRST OH NO YOU MUST HAVE MUCH TO TELL ME SINCE YOU HAVE COME TO SEEK ME WELL BE IT SO YOU HAVE CONTINUED YOUR COURSE OF VILLANY YOU HAVE ROBBED
7302-86814-0035 YOU HAVE ASSASSINATED WELL I SHOULD SAY IF YOU HAD ME TAKEN TO A PRIVATE ROOM ONLY TO TELL ME THIS YOU MIGHT HAVE SAVED YOURSELF THE TROUBLE I KNOW ALL THESE THINGS BUT THERE ARE SOME WITH WHICH
7302-86814-0036 WHO SO GRACEFULLY MOUNTED HIS HORSE
7302-86814-0037 AS THEY SAY AT THE GAME OF PINCETTE
7302-86814-0038 COME LET US TALK A LITTLE ABOUT MY FATHER WHO THEN AM I
7302-86814-0039 BUT IT WAS NOT YOU I PRESUME WHO PLACED AT MY DISPOSAL ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS WHICH I SPENT IN FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS IT WAS NOT YOU WHO MANUFACTURED AN ITALIAN GENTLEMAN FOR MY FATHER
7302-86814-0040 AMONGST THE REST WITH A CERTAIN PROCUREUR WHOSE ACQUAINTANCE I DID VERY WRONG NOT TO CULTIVATE FOR HE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME JUST NOW IT WAS NOT YOU IN FACT WHO BAILED ME FOR ONE OR TWO MILLIONS
7302-86814-0041 WORTHY FOSTER FATHER WELL WELL
7302-86814-0042 THERE RESIDES A VERY RICH GENTLEMAN AT WHOSE HOUSE YOU ROBBED AND MURDERED DID YOU NOT I BELIEVE I DID THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO TIS YOU WHO HAVE NAMED HIM
7302-86814-0043 IS TOO HIGHLY FAVORED BY HEAVEN TO BE THE FATHER OF SUCH A WRETCH AS YOU OH THESE ARE FINE WORDS AND THERE WILL BE FINE DOINGS IF YOU DO NOT TAKE CARE MENACES I DO NOT FEAR THEM I WILL SAY
7302-86814-0044 DO YOU THINK YOU ARE ENGAGED WITH A PYGMY LIKE YOURSELF
7302-86814-0045 WHAT DOES SCANDAL SIGNIFY TO ME WHAT POSSESSIONS WHAT REPUTATION WHAT PULL AS BEAUCHAMP SAYS HAVE I YOU GREAT PEOPLE ALWAYS LOSE SOMETHING BY SCANDAL NOTWITHSTANDING YOUR MILLIONS
7302-86814-0046 COME WHO IS MY FATHER I CAME TO TELL YOU AH CRIED BENEDETTO HIS EYES SPARKLING WITH JOY JUST THEN THE DOOR OPENED

7302-86814-0049 CAN I BE DECEIVED HE MURMURED AS HE STEPPED INTO THE OBLONG AND GRATED VEHICLE WHICH THEY CALL THE SALAD BASKET NEVER MIND WE SHALL SEE
7302-86815-0000 WHICH HAD RESTORED THE COURAGE OF NOIRTIER FOR EVER SINCE HE HAD CONVERSED WITH THE PRIEST HIS VIOLENT DESPAIR HAD YIELDED TO A CALM RESIGNATION WHICH SURPRISED ALL WHO KNEW HIS EXCESSIVE AFFECTION
7302-86815-0001 HAD NOT SEEN HIS FATHER SINCE THE MORNING OF THE DEATH THE WHOLE ESTABLISHMENT HAD BEEN CHANGED ANOTHER VALET WAS ENGAGED FOR HIMSELF
7302-86815-0002 TWO WOMEN HAD ENTERED MADAME DE VILLEFORT'S SERVICE IN FACT EVERYWHERE TO THE CONCIERGE AND COACHMEN NEW FACES WERE PRESENTED TO THE DIFFERENT MASTERS OF THE HOUSE
7302-86815-0003 THE PROOFS WERE CERTAINLY NOT CONVINCING SINCE THEY RESTED UPON A FEW WORDS WRITTEN BY AN ESCAPED GALLEY SLAVE ON HIS DEATH BED AND WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN ACTUATED BY HATRED OR REVENGE
7302-86815-0004 IN ACCUSING HIS COMPANION BUT THE MIND OF THE PROCUREUR WAS MADE UP HE FELT ASSURED THAT BENEDETTO WAS GUILTY AND HE HOPED BY HIS SKILL IN CONDUCTING THIS AGGRAVATED CASE TO FLATTER HIS SELF LOVE
7302-86815-0005 WHICH WAS ABOUT THE ONLY VULNERABLE POINT LEFT IN HIS FROZEN HEART THE CASE WAS THEREFORE PREPARED OWING TO THE INCESSANT LABOR
7302-86815-0006 WHO WISHED IT TO BE THE FIRST ON THE LIST IN THE COMING ASSIZES HE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO SECLUDE HIMSELF MORE THAN EVER TO EVADE THE ENORMOUS NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS
7302-86815-0007 PRESENTED TO HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING TICKETS OF ADMISSION TO THE COURT ON THE DAY OF TRIAL
7302-86815-0008 AND THE GLOOM WHICH OVERSHADOWED THE HOUSE WAS SO RECENT
7302-86815-0009 WHICH WERE THE ONLY MEANS HE HAD OF DISSIPATING HIS GRIEF ONCE ONLY HAD VILLEFORT SEEN HIS FATHER
7302-86815-0010 WHEN THE LATTER WAS TO LEARN HIS FATHER'S NAME THE MAGISTRATE HARASSED AND FATIGUED
7302-86815-0011 SIMILAR TO THAT IN WHICH TARQUIN LOPPED OFF THE TALLEST POPPIES HE BEGAN KNOCKING OFF WITH HIS CANE THE LONG AND DYING BRANCHES OF THE ROSE TREES WHICH PLACED ALONG THE AVENUE
7302-86815-0012 AT ONE OF THE OPEN WINDOWS
7302-86815-0013 WHICH VILLEFORT COULD SCARCELY DISTINGUISH HIS GLANCE WAS SO FULL OF HATE OF FEROCITY AND SAVAGE IMPATIENCE
7302-86815-0014 TO SEE UPON WHAT PERSON THIS DARK LOOK WAS DIRECTED THEN HE SAW BENEATH A THICK CLUMP OF LINDEN TREES WHICH WERE NEARLY DIVESTED OF FOLIAGE MADAME DE VILLEFORT SITTING WITH A BOOK IN HER HAND
7302-86815-0015 TO SMILE UPON HER SON OR TO THROW BACK HIS ELASTIC BALL WHICH HE OBSTINATELY THREW FROM THE DRAWING ROOM INTO THE GARDEN
7302-86815-0016 HOWEVER AT LENGTH HE DECIDED LEAPED OUT OF THE WINDOW INTO A CLUSTER OF HELIOTROPES AND DAISIES AND RAN TO HIS MOTHER HIS FOREHEAD STREAMING WITH PERSPIRATION
7302-86815-0017 PRESSED HER LIPS UPON IT AND SENT HIM BACK WITH THE BALL IN ONE HAND AND SOME BONBONS IN THE OTHER
7302-86815-0018 LIKE THAT OF THE BIRD TO THE SERPENT WALKED TOWARDS THE HOUSE AS HE APPROACHED IT
7302-86815-0019 FELT THEM PIERCE TO THE DEPTHS OF HIS HEART IN THAT EARNEST LOOK
7302-86815-0020 AS WELL AS A TERRIBLE MENACE THEN NOIRTIER RAISED HIS EYES TO HEAVEN
7302-86815-0021 IT IS WELL SIR REPLIED VILLEFORT FROM BELOW IT IS WELL HAVE PATIENCE BUT ONE DAY LONGER WHAT I HAVE SAID I WILL DO NOIRTIER SEEMED TO BE CALMED BY THESE WORDS
7302-86815-0022 AND TURNED HIS EYES WITH INDIFFERENCE TO THE OTHER SIDE
7302-86815-0023 WHICH SEEMED TO STRANGLE HIM AND PASSING HIS LIVID HAND ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD ENTERED HIS STUDY THE NIGHT WAS COLD AND STILL THE FAMILY HAD ALL RETIRED TO REST BUT VILLEFORT WHO ALONE REMAINED UP
7302-86815-0024 HE HAD TRACED IN RED INK THE MAGISTRATE HAD SLEPT FOR A SHORT TIME WHILE THE LAMP SENT FORTH ITS FINAL STRUGGLES ITS FLICKERINGS AWOKE HIM AND HE FOUND HIS FINGERS AS DAMP AND PURPLE AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN DIPPED IN BLOOD
7302-86815-0025 WHICH STOOD OUT IN BLACK RELIEF ON THE HORIZON IN THE CLOVER FIELDS BEYOND THE CHESTNUT TREES A LARK WAS MOUNTING UP TO HEAVEN WHILE POURING OUT HER CLEAR MORNING SONG
7302-86815-0026 AND REFRESHED HIS MEMORY TO DAY HE SAID WITH AN EFFORT TO DAY THE MAN WHO HOLDS THE BLADE OF JUSTICE MUST STRIKE WHEREVER THERE IS GUILT INVOLUNTARILY HIS EYES WANDERED TOWARDS THE WINDOW
7302-86815-0027 OF NOIRTIER'S ROOM WHERE HE HAD SEEN HIM THE PRECEDING NIGHT THE CURTAIN WAS DRAWN AND YET THE IMAGE OF HIS FATHER WAS SO VIVID TO HIS MIND THAT HE ADDRESSED THE CLOSED WINDOW AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN OPEN
7302-86815-0028 AND AS IF THROUGH THE OPENING HE HAD BEHELD THE MENACING OLD MAN YES HE MURMURED YES BE SATISFIED HIS HEAD DROPPED UPON HIS CHEST AND IN THIS POSITION HE PACED HIS STUDY
7302-86815-0029 THEN HE THREW HIMSELF DRESSED AS HE WAS UPON A SOFA LESS TO SLEEP THAN TO REST HIS LIMBS CRAMPED WITH COLD AND STUDY BY DEGREES EVERY ONE AWOKE
7302-86815-0030 HEARD THE SUCCESSIVE NOISES WHICH ACCOMPANY THE LIFE OF A HOUSE THE OPENING AND SHUTTING OF DOORS
7302-86815-0031 TO SUMMON THE WAITING MAID MINGLED WITH THE FIRST SHOUTS OF THE CHILD WHO ROSE FULL OF THE ENJOYMENT OF HIS AGE
7302-86815-0032 HIS NEW VALET BROUGHT HIM THE PAPERS AND WITH THEM A CUP OF CHOCOLATE WHAT ARE YOU BRINGING ME SAID HE A CUP OF CHOCOLATE I DID NOT ASK FOR IT WHO HAS PAID ME THIS ATTENTION
7302-86815-0033 MY MISTRESS SIR SHE SAID YOU WOULD HAVE TO SPEAK A GREAT DEAL IN THE MURDER CASE AND THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE SOMETHING TO KEEP UP YOUR STRENGTH AND THE VALET PLACED THE CUP ON THE TABLE NEAREST TO THE SOFA
7302-86815-0034 WITH A GLOOMY EXPRESSION THEN SUDDENLY TAKING IT UP WITH A NERVOUS MOTION HE SWALLOWED ITS CONTENTS AT ONE DRAUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THOUGHT THAT HE HOPED THE BEVERAGE WOULD BE MORTAL
7302-86815-0035 THE BREAKFAST HOUR ARRIVED

7367-86737-0056 IT WAS THUS THAT PINELLI THE FAMOUS SCULPTOR HAD COMMENCED A GIRL OF SIX OR SEVEN THAT IS A LITTLE YOUNGER THAN VAMPA TENDED SHEEP ON A FARM NEAR PALESTRINA SHE WAS AN ORPHAN BORN AT VALMONTONE AND WAS NAMED TERESA THE TWO CHILDREN MET
7367-86737-0057 HAD BEEN ABLE TO GAIN ANY INFLUENCE OVER HIM OR EVEN TO BECOME HIS COMPANION HIS DISPOSITION ALWAYS INCLINED TO EXACT CONCESSIONS RATHER THAN TO MAKE THEM KEPT HIM ALOOF FROM ALL FRIENDSHIPS TERESA ALONE RULED BY A LOOK
7367-86737-0058 THE TWO PIASTRES THAT LUIGI RECEIVED EVERY MONTH FROM THE COUNT OF SAN FELICE'S STEWARD AND THE PRICE OF ALL THE LITTLE CARVINGS IN WOOD HE SOLD AT ROME WERE EXPENDED IN EAR RINGS NECKLACES AND GOLD HAIRPINS SO THAT THANKS TO HER FRIEND'S GENEROSITY
7367-86737-0059 TERESA WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND THE BEST ATTIRED PEASANT NEAR ROME THE TWO CHILDREN GREW UP TOGETHER PASSING ALL THEIR TIME WITH EACH OTHER AND GIVING THEMSELVES UP TO THE WILD IDEAS OF THEIR DIFFERENT CHARACTERS
7367-86737-0060 THUS IN ALL THEIR DREAMS THEIR WISHES AND THEIR CONVERSATIONS VAMPA SAW HIMSELF THE CAPTAIN OF A VESSEL GENERAL OF AN ARMY OR GOVERNOR OF A PROVINCE TERESA SAW HERSELF RICH SUPERBLY ATTIRED
7367-86737-0061 AND ATTENDED BY A TRAIN OF LIVERIED DOMESTICS THEN WHEN THEY HAD THUS PASSED THE DAY IN BUILDING CASTLES IN THE AIR THEY SEPARATED THEIR FLOCKS AND DESCENDED FROM THE ELEVATION OF THEIR DREAMS TO THE REALITY OF THEIR HUMBLE POSITION
7367-86737-0062 AND PROWL AROUND HIS FLOCK THE STEWARD GAVE HIM A GUN THIS WAS WHAT VAMPA LONGED FOR THIS GUN HAD AN EXCELLENT BARREL MADE AT BRESCHIA AND CARRYING A BALL WITH THE PRECISION OF AN ENGLISH RIFLE BUT ONE DAY THE COUNT BROKE THE STOCK
7367-86737-0063 AND HAD THEN CAST THE GUN ASIDE THIS HOWEVER WAS NOTHING TO A SCULPTOR LIKE VAMPA HE EXAMINED THE BROKEN STOCK CALCULATED WHAT CHANGE IT WOULD REQUIRE TO ADAPT THE GUN TO HIS SHOULDER AND MADE A FRESH STOCK
7367-86737-0064 SO BEAUTIFULLY CARVED THAT IT WOULD HAVE FETCHED FIFTEEN OR TWENTY PIASTRES HAD HE CHOSEN TO SELL IT BUT NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER FROM HIS THOUGHTS FOR A LONG TIME A GUN HAD BEEN THE YOUNG MAN'S GREATEST AMBITION IN EVERY COUNTRY WHERE INDEPENDENCE HAS TAKEN THE PLACE OF LIBERTY
7367-86737-0065 THE FIRST DESIRE OF A MANLY HEART IS TO POSSESS A WEAPON WHICH AT ONCE RENDERS HIM CAPABLE OF DEFENCE OR ATTACK AND BY RENDERING ITS OWNER TERRIBLE OFTEN MAKES HIM FEARED FROM THIS MOMENT VAMPA DEVOTED ALL HIS LEISURE TIME TO PERFECTING HIMSELF IN THE USE OF HIS PRECIOUS WEAPON
7367-86737-0066 HE PURCHASED POWDER AND BALL AND EVERYTHING SERVED HIM FOR A MARK THE TRUNK OF SOME OLD AND MOSS GROWN OLIVETREE THAT GREW ON THE SABINE MOUNTAINS THE FOX AS HE QUITTED HIS EARTH ON SOME MARAUDING EXCURSION THE EAGLE THAT SOARED ABOVE THEIR HEADS
7367-86737-0067 AND THUS HE SOON BECAME SO EXPERT THAT TERESA OVERCAME THE TERROR SHE AT FIRST FELT AT THE REPORT AND AMUSED HERSELF BY WATCHING HIM DIRECT THE BALL WHEREVER HE PLEASED WITH AS MUCH ACCURACY AS IF HE PLACED IT BY HAND
7367-86737-0068 ONE EVENING A WOLF EMERGED FROM A PINE WOOD HEAR WHICH THEY WERE USUALLY STATIONED BUT THE WOLF HAD SCARCELY ADVANCED TEN YARDS ERE HE WAS DEAD PROUD OF THIS EXPLOIT VAMPA TOOK THE DEAD ANIMAL ON HIS SHOULDERS AND CARRIED HIM TO THE FARM
7367-86737-0069 THESE EXPLOITS HAD GAINED LUIGI CONSIDERABLE REPUTATION THE MAN OF SUPERIOR ABILITIES ALWAYS FINDS ADMIRERS GO WHERE HE WILL HE WAS SPOKEN OF AS THE MOST ADROIT THE STRONGEST AND THE MOST COURAGEOUS CONTADINO FOR TEN LEAGUES AROUND
7367-86737-0070 AND ALTHOUGH TERESA WAS UNIVERSALLY ALLOWED TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF THE SABINES NO ONE HAD EVER SPOKEN TO HER OF LOVE BECAUSE IT WAS KNOWN THAT SHE WAS BELOVED BY VAMPA AND YET THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE HAD NEVER DECLARED THEIR AFFECTION
7367-86737-0071 THEY HAD GROWN TOGETHER LIKE TWO TREES WHOSE ROOTS ARE MINGLED WHOSE BRANCHES INTERTWINED AND WHOSE INTERMINGLED PERFUME RISES TO THE HEAVENS ONLY THEIR WISH TO SEE EACH OTHER HAD BECOME A NECESSITY AND THEY WOULD HAVE PREFERRED DEATH TO A DAY'S SEPARATION
7367-86737-0072 TERESA WAS SIXTEEN AND VAMPA SEVENTEEN
7367-86737-0073 THE BRIGANDS HAVE NEVER BEEN REALLY EXTIRPATED FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ROME SOMETIMES A CHIEF IS WANTED BUT WHEN A CHIEF PRESENTS HIMSELF HE RARELY HAS TO WAIT LONG FOR A BAND OF FOLLOWERS THE CELEBRATED CUCUMETTO
7367-86737-0074 DRIVEN OUT OF THE KINGDOM OF NAPLES WHERE HE HAD CARRIED ON A REGULAR WAR HAD CROSSED THE GARIGLIANO LIKE MANFRED AND HAD TAKEN REFUGE ON THE BANKS OF THE AMASINE BETWEEN SONNINO AND JUPERNO
7367-86737-0075 HE STROVE TO COLLECT A BAND OF FOLLOWERS AND FOLLOWED THE FOOTSTEPS OF DECESARIS AND GASPERONE WHOM HE HOPED TO SURPASS MANY YOUNG MEN OF PALESTRINA FRASCATI AND PAMPINARA HAD DISAPPEARED
7367-86737-0076 THEIR DISAPPEARANCE AT FIRST CAUSED MUCH DISQUIETUDE BUT IT WAS SOON KNOWN THAT THEY HAD JOINED CUCUMETTO AFTER SOME TIME CUCUMETTO BECAME THE OBJECT OF UNIVERSAL ATTENTION
7367-86737-0077 THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY TRAITS OF FEROCIOUS DARING AND BRUTALITY WERE RELATED OF HIM ONE DAY HE CARRIED OFF A YOUNG GIRL THE DAUGHTER OF A SURVEYOR OF FROSINONE THE BANDIT'S LAWS ARE POSITIVE A YOUNG GIRL BELONGS FIRST TO HIM WHO CARRIES HER OFF
7367-86737-0078 THEN THE REST DRAW LOTS FOR HER AND SHE IS ABANDONED TO THEIR BRUTALITY UNTIL DEATH RELIEVES HER SUFFERINGS WHEN THEIR PARENTS ARE SUFFICIENTLY RICH TO PAY A RANSOM A MESSENGER IS SENT TO NEGOTIATE THE PRISONER IS HOSTAGE FOR THE SECURITY OF THE MESSENGER
7367-86737-0079 WHEN SHE RECOGNIZED HER LOVER THE POOR GIRL EXTENDED HER ARMS TO HIM AND BELIEVED HERSELF SAFE BUT CARLINI FELT HIS HEART SINK FOR HE BUT TOO WELL KNEW THE FATE THAT AWAITED HER HOWEVER AS HE WAS A FAVORITE WITH CUCUMETTO
7367-86737-0080 AS HE HAD FOR THREE YEARS FAITHFULLY SERVED HIM AND AS HE HAD SAVED HIS LIFE BY SHOOTING A DRAGOON WHO WAS ABOUT TO CUT HIM DOWN HE HOPED THE CHIEF WOULD HAVE PITY ON HIM HE TOOK CUCUMETTO ONE SIDE
7367-86737-0081 WHILE THE YOUNG GIRL SEATED AT THE FOOT OF A HUGE PINE THAT STOOD IN THE CENTRE OF THE FOREST MADE A VEIL OF HER PICTURESQUE HEAD DRESS TO HIDE HER FACE FROM THE LASCIVIOUS GAZE OF THE BANDITS THERE HE TOLD THE CHIEF ALL HIS AFFECTION FOR THE PRISONER
7367-86737-0082 THEIR PROMISES OF MUTUAL FIDELITY AND HOW EVERY NIGHT SINCE HE HAD BEEN NEAR THEY HAD MET IN SOME NEIGHBORING RUINS
7367-86737-0083 CUCUMETTO SEEMED TO YIELD TO HIS FRIEND'S ENTREATIES AND BADE HIM FIND A SHEPHERD TO SEND TO RITA'S FATHER AT FROSINONE CARLINI FLEW JOYFULLY TO RITA TELLING HER SHE WAS SAVED AND BIDDING HER WRITE TO HER FATHER TO INFORM HIM WHAT HAD OCCURRED
7367-86737-0084 AND THAT HER RANSOM WAS FIXED AT THREE HUNDRED PIASTRES TWELVE HOURS DELAY WAS ALL THAT WAS GRANTED THAT IS UNTIL NINE THE NEXT MORNING THE INSTANT THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN CARLINI SEIZED IT AND HASTENED TO THE PLAIN TO FIND A MESSENGER
7367-86737-0085 HE FOUND A YOUNG SHEPHERD WATCHING HIS FLOCK THE NATURAL MESSENGERS OF THE BANDITS ARE THE SHEPHERDS WHO LIVE BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE MOUNTAINS BETWEEN CIVILIZED AND SAVAGE LIFE THE BOY UNDERTOOK THE COMMISSION PROMISING TO BE IN FROSINONE IN LESS THAN AN HOUR
7367-86737-0086 CARLINI RETURNED ANXIOUS TO SEE HIS MISTRESS AND ANNOUNCE THE JOYFUL INTELLIGENCE HE FOUND THE TROOP IN THE GLADE SUPPING OFF THE PROVISIONS EXACTED AS CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE PEASANTS BUT HIS EYE VAINLY SOUGHT RITA AND CUCUMETTO AMONG THEM
7367-86737-0087 SAYING TO THE HEALTH OF THE BRAVE CUCUMETTO AND THE FAIR RITA AT THIS MOMENT CARLINI HEARD A WOMAN'S CRY HE DIVINED THE TRUTH SEIZED THE GLASS BROKE IT ACROSS THE FACE OF HIM WHO PRESENTED IT AND RUSHED TOWARDS THE SPOT
7367-86737-0088 WHENCE THE CRY CAME AFTER A HUNDRED YARDS HE TURNED THE CORNER OF THE THICKET HE FOUND RITA SENSELESS IN THE ARMS OF CUCUMETTO AT THE SIGHT OF CARLINI CUCUMETTO ROSE A PISTOL IN EACH HAND THE TWO BRIGANDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR A MOMENT
7367-86737-0089 THE ONE WITH A SMILE OF LASCIVIOUSNESS ON HIS LIPS THE OTHER WITH THE PALLOR OF DEATH ON HIS BROW A TERRIBLE BATTLE BETWEEN THE TWO MEN SEEMED IMMINENT BUT BY DEGREES CARLINI'S FEATURES RELAXED HIS HAND WHICH HAD GRASPED ONE OF THE PISTOLS IN HIS BELT
7367-86737-0090 THIS YOUNG GIRL IS CHARMING AND DOES CREDIT TO YOUR TASTE NOW AS I AM NOT EGOTISTICAL WE WILL RETURN TO OUR COMRADES AND DRAW LOTS FOR HER HAVE DETERMINED THEN TO ABANDON HER TO THE COMMON LAW SAID CARLINI
7367-86737-0091 WHY SHOULD AN EXCEPTION BE MADE IN HER FAVOR I THOUGHT THAT MY ENTREATIES' WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU ANY MORE THAN THE REST TO ASK FOR AN EXCEPTION IS TRUE
7367-86737-0092 CONTINUED CUCUMETTO LAUGHING SOONER OR LATER YOUR TURN WILL COME CARLINI'S TEETH CLINCHED CONVULSIVELY NOW THEN SAID CUCUMETTO ADVANCING TOWARDS THE OTHER BANDITS ARE YOU COMING
7367-86737-0093 HE CONTINUED TO FOLLOW THE PATH TO THE GLADE BUT TO HIS GREAT SURPRISE CARLINI ARRIVED ALMOST AS SOON AS HIMSELF LET US DRAW LOTS LET US DRAW LOTS CRIED ALL THE BRIGANDS WHEN THEY SAW THE CHIEF
7367-86737-0094 THEIR DEMAND WAS FAIR AND THE CHIEF INCLINED HIS HEAD IN SIGN OF ACQUIESCENCE THE EYES OF ALL SHONE FIERCELY AS THEY MADE THEIR DEMAND AND THE RED LIGHT OF THE FIRE MADE THEM LOOK LIKE DEMONS THE NAMES OF ALL INCLUDING CARLINI WERE PLACED IN A HAT
7367-86737-0095 AND THE YOUNGEST OF THE BAND DREW FORTH A TICKET THE TICKET BORE THE NAME OF DIOVOLACCIO HE WAS THE MAN WHO HAD PROPOSED TO CARLINI THE HEALTH OF THEIR CHIEF
7367-86737-0096 AND TO WHOM CARLINI REPLIED BY BREAKING THE GLASS ACROSS HIS FACE A LARGE WOUND EXTENDING FROM THE TEMPLE TO THE MOUTH WAS BLEEDING PROFUSELY DIOVALACCIO SEEING HIMSELF THUS FAVORED BY FORTUNE BURST INTO A LOUD LAUGH CAPTAIN
7367-86737-0097 DIAVOLACCIO SAID HE CALMLY AND HE DRANK IT OFF WITHOUT HIS HAND TREMBLING IN THE LEAST THEN SITTING DOWN BY THE FIRE MY SUPPER SAID HE MY EXPEDITION HAS GIVEN ME AN APPETITE
7367-86737-0098 THAT IS ACTING LIKE A GOOD FELLOW AND THEY ALL FORMED A CIRCLE ROUND THE FIRE
7367-86737-0099 CARLINI ATE AND DRANK AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED THE BANDITS LOOKED ON WITH ASTONISHMENT AT THIS SINGULAR CONDUCT UNTIL THEY HEARD FOOTSTEPS THEY TURNED ROUND
7367-86737-0100 THAT EVERY ONE ROSE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CARLINI WHO REMAINED SEATED AND ATE AND DRANK CALMLY DIAVOLACCIO ADVANCED AMIDST THE MOST PROFOUND SILENCE AND LAID RITA AT THE CAPTAIN'S FEET
7367-86737-0101 I NOW UNDERSTAND WHY CARLINI STAYED BEHIND ALL SAVAGE NATURES APPRECIATE A DESPERATE DEED NO OTHER OF THE BANDITS WOULD PERHAPS HAVE DONE THE SAME BUT THEY ALL UNDERSTOOD WHAT CARLINI HAD DONE NOW THEN CRIED CARLINI
7367-86737-0102 RISING IN HIS TURN AND APPROACHING THE CORPSE HIS HAND ON THE BUTT OF ONE OF HIS PISTOLS DOES ANY ONE DISPUTE THE POSSESSION OF THIS WOMAN WITH ME
7367-86737-0103 RETURNED THE CHIEF SHE IS THINE CARLINI RAISED HER IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED HER OUT OF THE CIRCLE OF FIRELIGHT CUCUMETTO PLACED HIS SENTINELS FOR THE NIGHT AND THE BANDITS WRAPPED THEMSELVES IN THEIR CLOAKS AND LAY DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE
7367-86737-0104 AT MIDNIGHT THE SENTINEL GAVE THE ALARM AND IN AN INSTANT ALL WERE ON THE ALERT IT WAS RITA'S FATHER WHO BROUGHT HIS DAUGHTER'S RANSOM IN PERSON HERE SAID HE TO CUCUMETTO HERE ARE THREE HUNDRED PIASTRES GIVE ME BACK MY CHILD
7367-86737-0105 BUT THE CHIEF WITHOUT TAKING THE MONEY
7367-86737-0106 THE OLD MAN OBEYED THEY BOTH ADVANCED BENEATH THE TREES THROUGH WHOSE BRANCHES STREAMED THE MOONLIGHT CUCUMETTO STOPPED AT LAST AND POINTED TO TWO PERSONS GROUPED AT THE FOOT OF A TREE THERE SAID HE DEMAND THY CHILD OF CARLINI
7367-86737-0107 HE WILL TELL THEE WHAT HAS BECOME OF HER AND HE RETURNED TO HIS COMPANIONS THE OLD MAN REMAINED MOTIONLESS HE FELT THAT SOME GREAT AND UNFORESEEN MISFORTUNE HUNG OVER HIS HEAD AT LENGTH HE ADVANCED TOWARD THE GROUP THE MEANING OF WHICH HE COULD NOT COMPREHEND
7367-86737-0108 AS HE APPROACHED CARLINI RAISED HIS HEAD AND THE FORMS OF TWO PERSONS BECAME VISIBLE TO THE OLD MAN'S EYES A WOMAN LAY ON THE GROUND HER HEAD RESTING ON THE KNEES OF A MAN WHO WAS SEATED BY HER AS HE RAISED HIS HEAD
7367-86737-0109 THE WOMAN'S FACE BECAME VISIBLE THE OLD MAN RECOGNIZED HIS CHILD AND CARLINI RECOGNIZED THE OLD MAN I EXPECTED THEE SAID THE BANDIT TO RITA'S FATHER
7367-86737-0110 I LOVED HER THEREFORE I SLEW HER FOR SHE WOULD HAVE SERVED AS THE SPORT OF THE WHOLE BAND THE OLD MAN SPOKE NOT AND GREW PALE AS DEATH NOW CONTINUED CARLINI IF I HAVE DONE WRONGLY AVENGE HER
7367-86737-0111 AND WITHDRAWING THE KNIFE FROM THE WOUND IN RITA'S BOSOM HE HELD IT OUT TO THE OLD MAN WITH ONE HAND WHILE WITH THE OTHER HE TORE OPEN HIS VEST
7367-86737-0112 RETURNED THE OLD MAN IN A HOARSE VOICE EMBRACE ME MY SON CARLINI THREW HIMSELF SOBBING LIKE A CHILD INTO THE ARMS OF HIS MISTRESS'S FATHER THESE WERE THE FIRST TEARS THE MAN OF BLOOD HAD EVER WEPT NOW SAID THE OLD MAN
7367-86737-0113 AID ME TO BURY MY CHILD CARLINI FETCHED TWO PICKAXES AND THE FATHER AND THE LOVER BEGAN TO DIG AT THE FOOT OF A HUGE OAK BENEATH WHICH THE YOUNG GIRL WAS TO REPOSE WHEN THE GRAVE WAS FORMED THE FATHER KISSED HER FIRST AND THEN THE LOVER
7367-86737-0114 THEN EXTENDING HIS HAND THE OLD MAN SAID I THANK YOU MY SON AND NOW LEAVE ME ALONE
7367-86737-0115 I COMMAND YOU CARLINI OBEYED REJOINED HIS COMRADES FOLDED HIMSELF IN HIS CLOAK AND SOON APPEARED TO SLEEP AS SOUNDLY AS THE REST IT HAD BEEN RESOLVED THE NIGHT BEFORE TO CHANGE THEIR ENCAMPMENT
7367-86737-0116 AN HOUR BEFORE DAYBREAK CUCUMETTO AROUSED HIS MEN AND GAVE THE WORD TO MARCH BUT CARLINI WOULD NOT QUIT THE FOREST WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HAD BECOME OF RITA'S FATHER HE WENT TOWARD THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIM
7367-86737-0117 HE FOUND THE OLD MAN SUSPENDED FROM ONE OF THE BRANCHES OF THE OAK WHICH SHADED HIS DAUGHTER'S GRAVE HE THEN TOOK AN OATH OF BITTER VENGEANCE OVER THE DEAD BODY OF THE ONE AND THE TOMB OF THE OTHER
7367-86737-0118 HE SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED A BALL BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS THAT ASTONISHMENT CEASED WHEN ONE OF THE BRIGANDS REMARKED TO HIS COMRADES THAT CUCUMETTO WAS STATIONED TEN PACES IN CARLINI'S REAR WHEN HE FELL ON THE MORNING OF THE DEPARTURE FROM THE FOREST OF FROSINONE
7402-59171-0000 MISTER SHAW CAME FOR A SHORT TIME RECENTLY TO BE REGARDED LESS AS AN AUTHOR THAN AS AN INCIDENT IN THE EUROPEAN WAR IN THE OPINION OF MANY PEOPLE IT SEEMED AS IF THE ALLIES WERE FIGHTING AGAINST A COMBINATION COMPOSED OF GERMANY
7402-59171-0001 AND HE DOES EXPRESS AN OPINION ON EVERYTHING WITHOUT MAKING A MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE SHAKE THEIR FISTS IN IMPOTENT ANGER HIS LIFE AT LEAST HIS PUBLIC LIFE
7402-59171-0002 HE HAS GONE ABOUT LIKE A PICKPOCKET OF ILLUSIONS FROM THE WORLD OF LITERATURE TO THE WORLD OF MORALS AND FROM THE WORLD OF MORALS TO THE WORLD OF POLITICS AND EVERYWHERE HE HAS GONE AN INNUMERABLE GROWL HAS FOLLOWED HIM
7402-59171-0003 NOT THAT HE HAS NOT HAD HIS DISCIPLES MEN AND WOMEN WHO BELIEVE THAT WHAT MISTER SHAW SAYS ON ANY CONCEIVABLE SUBJECT IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHAT THE TIMES OR THE MANCHESTER GUARDIAN SAYS HE HAS NEVER FOUNDED A CHURCH HOWEVER
7402-59171-0004 BECAUSE HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO LAUGH AT HIS DISCIPLES AS UNFEELINGLY AS AT ANYBODY ELSE HE HAS COURTED UNPOPULARITY AS OTHER MEN HAVE COURTED POPULARITY HE HAS REFUSED TO ASSUME THE VACUOUS COUNTENANCE EITHER OF AN IDOL
7402-59171-0005 SEEMS LIKE LIFE IN RUINS ARE FILLED AT TIMES WITH A WILD LUST TO DENOUNCE AND BELITTLE HIM HE HAS BEEN CALLED MORE NAMES THAN ANY OTHER MAN OF LETTERS ALIVE
7402-59171-0006 WHEN ALL THE OTHER NAMES HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED AND WE ARE ABOUT TO BECOME INARTICULATE WE EVEN DENOUNCE HIM AS A BORE BUT THIS IS ONLY THE BILLINGSGATE OF OUR EXASPERATION MISTER SHAW IS NOT A BORE
7402-59171-0007 WHATEVER ELSE HE MAY BE HE HAS SUCCEEDED IN THE MERE BUSINESS OF INTERESTING US BEYOND ANY OTHER WRITER OF HIS TIME
7402-59171-0008 PROBABLY HE WAS DOOMED TO BE A FIGURE JUST AS DOCTOR JOHNSON WAS IF HE HAD NOT TOLD US LEGENDS ABOUT HIMSELF
7402-59171-0009 IN SEARCH OF A GHOST WITH ITS BEARD ON FIRE HIS CRITICS OFTEN ACCUSE HIM IN REGARD TO THE INVENTION OF THE SHAW MYTH OF HAVING DESIGNED A POSTER RATHER THAN PAINTED A PORTRAIT
7402-59171-0010 STOP ADVERTISING MYSELF ON THE CONTRARY I MUST DO IT MORE THAN EVER LOOK AT PEARS'S SOAP THERE IS A SOLID HOUSE IF YOU LIKE BUT EVERY WALL IS STILL PLASTERED WITH THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS IF I WERE TO GIVE UP ADVERTISING
7402-59171-0011 MY BUSINESS WOULD IMMEDIATELY BEGIN TO FALL OFF YOU BLAME ME FOR HAVING DECLARED MYSELF TO BE THE MOST REMARKABLE MAN OF MY TIME BUT THE CLAIM IS AN ARGUABLE ONE WHY SHOULD I NOT SAY IT WHEN I BELIEVE THAT IT IS TRUE
7402-59171-0012 HE IS IN THE LINE OF ALL THOSE TRAMPS AND STAGE IRISHMEN WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH LIFE WITH SO FINE A SWAGGER OF WORDS THIS ONLY MEANS THAT IN HIS LIFE HE IS AN ARTIST
7402-59171-0013 UNTIL WE REALIZE THAT HE IS AN ARTIST NOT ONLY IN THE INVENTION OF HIS OWN LIFE BUT IN THE OBSERVATION OF THE LIVES OF OTHER PEOPLE HIS BROADBENT IS AS WONDERFUL A FIGURE AS HIS GEORGE BERNARD SHAW NOT THAT HIS PORTRAITURE IS ALWAYS FAITHFUL
7402-59171-0014 HE SEES MEN AND WOMEN TOO FREQUENTLY IN THE REFRACTING SHALLOWS OF THEORIES HE IS A DOCTRINAIRE AND HIS CHARACTERS ARE OFTEN COMIC STATEMENTS OF HIS DOCTRINES RATHER THAN THE REFLECTIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN
7402-59171-0015 HE OBSERVES IN ONE OF THE MANY PASSAGES IN WHICH HE JUSTIFIES HIMSELF THE AUDIENCE THINKS IT IS BEING MADE FUN OF IN REALITY I AM SIMPLY A VERY CAREFUL WRITER OF NATURAL HISTORY
7402-59171-0016 ONE IS BOUND TO CONTRADICT HIM MISTER SHAW OFTEN THINKS HE IS PRESENTING TRUE HUMAN NATURE WHEN HE IS MERELY PRESENTING HIS OPINIONS ABOUT HUMAN NATURE THE HUMAN NATURE OF SOLDIERS OF ARTISTS OF WOMEN OR
7402-59171-0017 RATHER WHEN HE IS PRESENTING A QUEER FIZZING MIXTURE OF HUMAN NATURE AND HIS OPINIONS ABOUT IT THIS MAY BE SOMETIMES ACTUALLY A VIRTUE IN HIS COMEDY CERTAINLY FROM THE TIME OF ARISTOPHANES ONWARDS
7402-59171-0018 ADMIRABLY TRUE BOTH TO HUMAN NATURE AND TO MISTER SHAW'S VIEW OF THE HUMAN NATURE OF ARTISTS BUT WHEN HE GOES ON WITH HIS LAST BREATH TO UTTER HIS ARTISTIC CREED I BELIEVE IN MICHAEL ANGELO VELASQUEZ AND REMBRANDT IN THE MIGHT OF DESIGN
7402-59171-0019 THE REDEMPTION OF ALL THINGS BY BEAUTY EVERLASTING AND THE MESSAGE OF ART THAT HAS MADE THESE HANDS BLESSED AMEN AMEN THESE SENTENCES ARE NO MORE NATURAL OR NATURALISTIC
7402-59171-0020 WITHOUT ANY ADMIXTURE OF HUMANITY REPEATING MISTER SHAW'S OPINION OF THE NATURE OF THE CREED OF ARTISTS THERE IS A SIMILAR FALSIFICATION IN THE SAME PLAY IN THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE NEWSPAPER MAN WHO IS PRESENT AT DUBEDAT'S DEATH
7402-59171-0021 BECAUSE INTO AN ATMOSPHERE OF MORE OR LESS NATURALISTIC COMEDY THEY SIMPLY INTRODUCE A FARCICAL EXAGGERATION OF MISTER SHAW'S OPINION OF THE INCOMPETENCE AND IMPUDENCE OF JOURNALISTS MISTER SHAW'S COMEDIES ARE REPEATEDLY INJURED
7402-59171-0022 BY A HURRIED ALTERATION OF ATMOSPHERE IN THIS MANNER COMEDY AS WELL AS TRAGEDY MUST CREATE SOME KIND OF ILLUSION AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ILLUSION EVEN FOR THE SAKE OF A JOKE MAY MEAN THE DESTRUCTION OF LAUGHTER
7402-59171-0023 THE PROPORTION OF UNREALITY IS NOT OVERWHELMING IT HAS BEEN ENORMOUSLY EXAGGERATED AFTER ALL IF THE CHARACTER OF THE NEWSPAPER MAN IN THE DOCTOR'S DILEMMA IS MACHINE MADE
7402-59171-0024 THE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT CHARACTER OF B B THE SOOTHING AND INCOMPETENT DOCTOR IS A CREATION OF THE TRUE COMIC GENIUS NINE PEOPLE OUT OF TEN HARP ON MISTER SHAW'S ERRORS
7402-59171-0025 IT IS MUCH MORE NECESSARY THAT WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT AMID ALL HIS FALSIFICATIONS DOCTRINAL AND JOCULAR HE HAS A GENUINE COMIC SENSE OF CHARACTER MOST FRENCH CRITICS
7402-59171-0026 DECLARE THAT BERNARD SHAW DOES DEPICT CHARACTERS
7402-59171-0027 MOLIERE HAS NEVER DRAWN A DOCTOR MORE COMICALLY THE DOCTOR THAN PARAMORE NOR MORE CHARACTERISTIC FIGURES OF WOMEN THAN THOSE IN THE SAME PLAY THE PHILANDERER THE CHARACTER DRAWING IS ADMIRABLE
7402-59171-0028 AND THE CHARACTERIZATION IN MOLIERE IN SHAW'S PLAYS THE CHARACTERS ARE LESS REPRESENTATIVE OF VICES OR PASSIONS THAN THOSE OF MOLIERE AND MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF CLASS PROFESSION OR SECT
7402-59171-0029 MOLIERE DEPICTS THE MISER THE JEALOUS MAN THE MISANTHROPE THE HYPOCRITE WHEREAS SHAW DEPICTS THE BOURGEOIS THE REBEL THE CAPITALIST THE WORKMAN THE SOCIALIST THE DOCTOR
7402-59171-0030 A FEW ONLY OF THESE LATTER TYPES ARE GIVEN US BY MOLIERE
7402-59171-0031 OF FARCE AND SO FORTH IS A SUGGESTIVE CONTRIBUTION TO CRITICISM I AM NOT SURE THAT THE COMPARISON WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE EFFECTIVELY PUT IN A CHAPTER THAN A BOOK
7402-59171-0032 IS INTENDED AS A BIOGRAPHY AND GENERAL CRITICISM OF MISTER SHAW AS WELL AS A COMPARISON BETWEEN HIS WORK AND MOLIERE'S IT CONTAINS IT MUST BE CONFESSED A GREAT DEAL THAT IS NOT NEW TO ENGLISH READERS
7402-59171-0033 MISTER SHAW IS MADE AN IDOL IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
7402-59171-0034 IS AN OFFERING AT A SHRINE THE TRUE THINGS IT CONTAINS HOWEVER MAKE IT WORTH READING
7402-59171-0035 FOR INSTANCE WHAT MANY CRITICS HAVE FAILED TO SEE THAT IN HIS DRAMATIC WORK MISTER SHAW IS LESS A WIT THAN A HUMORIST IN SHAW'S WORK WE FIND FEW STUDIED JESTS FEW EPIGRAMS EVEN
7402-59171-0036 MOLIERE ANTICIPATED MISTER SHAW IN OUTRAGING THE SENTIMENT FOR INSTANCE WHICH HAS GATHERED ROUND THE FAMILY MOLIERE AND SHAW AS HE PUTS IT WITH QUAINT SERIOUSNESS APPEAR TO BE UNAWARE OF WHAT A FATHER IS WHAT A FATHER IS WORTH
7402-59171-0037 THE DEFENCE OF MISTER SHAW HOWEVER DOES NOT DEPEND ON ANY REAL OR IMAGINARY RESEMBLANCE OF HIS PLAYS TO MOLIERE'S HIS JOY AND HIS MISERY BEFORE THE LUDICROUS SPECTACLE OF HUMAN LIFE ARE HIS OWN AND HIS EXPRESSION OF THEM
7402-59171-0038 IS HIS OWN HE HAS STUDIED WITH HIS OWN EYES THE SWOLLEN BELLIED PRETENCES OF PREACHERS AND POETS AND RICH MEN AND LOVERS AND POLITICIANS AND HE HAS DERIDED THEM AS THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN DERIDED ON THE ENGLISH STAGE BEFORE
7402-59171-0039 HE HAS DERIDED THEM WITH BOTH AN ARTISTIC AND A MORAL ENERGY HE HAS BROUGHT THEM ALL INTO A PALACE OF TRUTH WHERE THEY HAVE REVEALED THEMSELVES WITH AN UNACCUSTOMED AND STARTLING FRANKNESS
7402-59171-0040 HE HAS DONE THIS SOMETIMES WITH ALL THE EXUBERANCE OF MIRTH SOMETIMES WITH ALL THE BITTERNESS OF A SATIRIST EVEN HIS BITTERNESS IS NEVER VENOMOUS HOWEVER HE IS GENIAL BEYOND THE MAJORITY OF INVETERATE CONTROVERSIALISTS AND PROPAGANDISTS
7402-59171-0041 HE DOES NOT HESITATE TO WOUND AND HE DOES NOT HESITATE TO MISUNDERSTAND BUT HE IS FREE FROM MALICE THE GENIALITY OF HIS COMEDY ON THE OTHER HAND IS OFTEN MORE OFFENSIVE THAN MALICE
7402-59171-0042 BECAUSE IT IS FROM AN ORTHODOX POINT OF VIEW GENIALITY IN THE WRONG PLACE IT IS LIKE A GRIN IN CHURCH A LAUGH AT A MARRIAGE SERVICE
7402-59171-0043 THAT HE WAS NOT INTENSELY SERIOUS IN ALL THAT HE WROTE ABOUT THE WAR BUT HIS SERIOUSNESS IS ESSENTIALLY THE SERIOUSNESS OF IN THE HIGHER SENSE OF THE WORD THE COMIC ARTIST OF THE DISILLUSIONIST
7402-59171-0044 HE SEES CURRENT HISTORY FROM THE ABSOLUTELY OPPOSITE POINT OF VIEW SAY TO THE LYRIC POET
7402-59171-0045 THOUGH HIS ATTITUDE TO THE WAR WAS AS ANTI PRUSSIAN
7402-59171-0046 A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE THOUGHT HE MUST BE A PRO GERMAN THE FACT IS IN WAR TIME MORE THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME PEOPLE DREAD THE VISION OF THE SATIRIST AND THE SCEPTIC
7402-59171-0047 THIS IS NOT TO DISPARAGE MISTER SHAW'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DISCUSSION OF POLITICS THAT CONTRIBUTION HAS BEEN BRILLIANT CHALLENGING AND HUMANE AND NOT MORE WAYWARD THAN THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE PARTISAN
7402-59171-0048 IT MAY BE SAID OF MISTER SHAW THAT IN HIS POLITICS AS IN HIS PLAYS HE HAS SOUGHT UTOPIA ALONG THE PATH OF DISILLUSION AS OTHER MEN HAVE SOUGHT IT ALONG THE PATH OF IDEALISM
7402-90848-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS AN OLD WIDOW WOMAN WHO HAD THREE SONS THE FIRST TWO WERE CLEVER ENOUGH BUT THE THIRD BOBO BY NAME WAS LITTLE BETTER THAN A SILLY SIMPLETON ALL HIS MOTHER'S SCOLDINGS AND BEATINGS
7402-90848-0001 AND SHE SMACKED THE POOR LAD SOUNDLY A DOZEN TIMES A DAY DID HIM NO GOOD WHATEVER NOW IT CAME TO PASS THAT ONE MORNING PRINCESS ZENZA THE RULER OF THE LAND HAPPENED TO PASS BY THE COTTAGE AND HEARD BOBO BEING GIVEN A TERRIBLE TONGUE LASHING
7402-90848-0002 CURIOUS AS TO THE CAUSE OF ALL THE NOISE THE PRINCESS DREW REIN AND SUMMONED BOBO'S MOTHER TO COME NEAR ON HEARING HER STORY IT OCCURRED TO THE PRINCESS THAT SO SILLY A LAD MIGHT AMUSE HER
7402-90848-0003 NOW HE WOULD BE SENT TO FIND A WHITE CRAW'S FEATHER OR A SPRAY OF YELLOW BLUEBELLS NOW HE WAS ORDERED TO LOOK FOR A SQUARE WHEEL OR A GLASS OF DRY WATER EVERYBODY LAUGHED AT HIM AND MADE FUN OF HIM THAT IS
7402-90848-0004 EVERYBODY EXCEPT LITTLE TILDA THE KITCHEN MAID WHEN POOR BOBO USED TO RETURN FROM SOME WILD GOOSE CHASE TIRED OUT MUD STAINED AND OFTEN ENOUGH WET TO THE SKIN
7402-90848-0005 INSTEAD OF LAUGHING LITTLE TILDA WOULD FIND HIM A GLASS OF WARM MILK HANG HIS COAT BY THE FIRE TO DRY AND TELL HIM NOT TO BE SUCH A SIMPLETON AGAIN THUS AFTER A WHILE
7402-90848-0006 ONE PLEASANT MID SUMMER MORNING WHEN BOBO HAD BEEN NEARLY A YEAR AT THE CASTLE PRINCESS ZENZA OVERSLEPT HALF AN HOUR AND DID NOT COME DOWN TO BREAKFAST AT THE USUAL TIME WHEN SHE DID GET UP SHE FOUND HER COURT WAITING FOR HER IN THE CASTLE GARDENS
7402-90848-0007 SHALL WE SEND BOBO IN SEARCH OF THE LOST HALF HOUR SAID THE PRINCESS TO THE COURTIERS YES YES CRIED THE COURTIERS BOBO SHALL LOOK FOR THE LOST HALF HOUR I'LL GIVE HIM A HORSE SAID ONE
7402-90848-0008 WHEN HE RETURNED THE GOOD KITCHEN MAID SAID LITTLE FOR SHE FEARED LEST SOME MISADVENTURE OVERTAKE THE POOR SIMPLETON BUT WHEN THE CHIEF COOK WAS NOT LOOKING SHE TUCKED A FRESH CURRANT BUN INTO BOBO'S POCKET
7402-90848-0009 GOOD BYE BOBO CRIED THE ASSEMBLED COURTIERS WHO WERE ALMOST BESIDE THEMSELVES WITH LAUGHTER AT THE SIMPLETON AND HIS ERRAND DON'T FAIL TO BRING BACK THE LOST HALF HOUR SO BOBO RODE OVER THE HILLS AND FAR AWAY
7402-90848-0010 IT WAS VERY DIGNIFIED AND WORE TORTOISE SHELL GLASSES BUT BOBO HAD TO ANSWER NO AND THE OLD MAN WANDERED ON AGAIN ANOTHER DAY THE SIMPLETON ENCOUNTERED A TALL DARK FIERCE KIND OF FELLOW
7402-90848-0011 WHO ANSWERED HIS POLITE QUESTION WITH A SCREAM OF RAGE A HALF HOUR HE ROARED NO I HAVE N'T SEEN YOUR HALF HOUR I WOULD N'T TELL YOU IF I HAD WHAT'S MORE I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT
7402-90848-0012 I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING I'VE LOST MYSELF I'VE LOST MY TEMPER
7402-90848-0013 ANSWER ME YOU SILLY HAVE YOU SEEN A LOST TEMPER ANYWHERE IT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF A LARGE MELON AND HAS SHARP LITTLE POINTS ON BOBO'S ANSWERING NO THIS DREADFUL PERSON UTTERED SO PERFECTLY AWFUL A SCREECH OF RAGE
7402-90848-0014 THAT BOBO'S HORSE TOOK FRIGHT AND RAN AWAY WITH HIM AND IT WAS ALL THAT BOBO COULD DO TO REIN HIM IN THREE MILES FARTHER DOWN THE ROAD STILL FARTHER ALONG BOBO CAME TO ZIZZ THE CAPITAL CITY OF THE KINGDOM OF THE SEVEN BROOKS AND WAS TAKEN BEFORE THE KING HIMSELF
7402-90848-0015 HERE THE POOR OLD KING TOOK OUT A GREAT GREEN HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED HIS EYES SHE WAS STOLEN BY THE FAIRIES ON MIDSUMMER EVE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO FIND HER WORTHY BOBO AND AN IMMENSE REWARD WILL BE YOURS
7402-90848-0016 AND HE CONTINUED HIS WAY ON FOOT THREE LONG YEARS PASSED AND BOBO GREW INTO A HANDSOME LAD BUT REMAINED A SIMPLETON STILL FINALLY AFTER HE HAD WANDERED ALL ABOUT FAIRYLAND HE CAME TO THE EDGE OF THE SEA
7402-90848-0017 BOBO ASKED THE SAILORS IF THEY HAD SEEN A LOST HALF HOUR NO SAID THE SAILORS BUT WE ARE GOING TO THE ISLES OF IRON SUPPOSE YOU GO WITH US THE LOST HALF HOUR MAY BE THERE
7402-90848-0018 SO BOBO WENT ABOARD THE SHIP AND SAILED OUT UPON THE DARK SEA FOR TWO DAYS THE WEATHER WAS WARM AND CLEAR BUT ON THE THIRD DAY THERE CAME A DREADFUL STORM AND ON THE THIRD NIGHT THE VESSEL WAS DRIVEN FAR OFF HER COURSE INTO THE UNKNOWN OCEAN
7402-90848-0019 AND WAS WRECKED UPON A MYSTERIOUS ISLAND OF ROCKS THAT SHONE IN THE NIGHT LIKE WET MATCHES A GREAT WAVE SWEPT THE DECKS AND BOBO WAS BORNE AWAY FROM HIS COMPANIONS AND CARRIED TOWARD THE SHINING LAND
7402-90848-0020 THOUGH POUNDED AND BATTERED BY THE FOAMING WAVES THE SIMPLETON AT LENGTH MANAGED TO REACH THE BEACH AND TOOK REFUGE IN A CREVICE OF THE CLIFF DURING THE STORMY NIGHT WHEN THE DAWN BROKE ALL SIGN OF THE SHIP HAD DISAPPEARED
7402-90848-0021 LOOKING ABOUT BOBO FOUND HIMSELF ON A LOVELY ISLAND WHOSE HEART WAS A HIGH MOUNTAIN MASS HIDDEN IN THE FOG STILL SWEEPING IN FROM THE SEA THERE WAS NOT A HOUSE A ROAD OR A PATH TO BE SEEN
7402-90848-0022 IN WHICH WERE A PAIR OF WOODEN SHOES ABOVE THE SHOES WAS A CARD SAYING SIMPLY
7402-90848-0023 SO BOBO SAT DOWN ON A STONE BY THE FOOT OF THE TREE AND PUT ON THE WOODEN SHOES WHICH FITTED HIM VERY NICELY NOW THESE SHOES WERE MAGIC SHOES AND BOBO HAD HARDLY STEPPED INTO THEM BEFORE THEY TURNED HIS FEET INLAND
7402-90848-0024 SO BOBO OBEDIENTLY LET THE SHOES GUIDE HIM AT CORNERS THE SHOES ALWAYS TURNED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND IF BOBO FORGOT AND BLUNDERED ON THE WRONG WAY THE SHOES SWIFTLY BEGAN TO PINCH HIS TOES
7402-90848-0025 FOR TWO DAYS BOBO WALKED INLAND TOWARD THE GREAT MOUNTAIN A WARM WIND BLEW THE CLOUDS AND RAIN AWAY THE SUN SHONE SWEET AND CLEAR ON THE MORNING OF THE THIRD DAY THE SIMPLETON ENTERED A WOOD OF TALL SILENT TREES
7402-90848-0026 AND AS THAT DAY WAS DRAWING TO A CLOSE TURRETS OF A MAGNIFICENT CASTLE ROSE FAR AWAY OVER THE LEAVES OF THE FOREST BOBO ARRIVED AT TWILIGHT
7402-90848-0027 HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN LYING BETWEEN THE CASTLE WALLS AND THE RISING SLOPES OF A GREAT MOUNTAIN STRANGE TO SAY NOT A LIVING CREATURE WAS TO BE SEEN AND THOUGH THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE CASTLE
7402-90848-0028 THERE WAS NOT EVEN A WARDER AT THE GATE SUDDENLY A GREAT BOOMING BELL STRUCK SEVEN O'CLOCK BOBO BEGAN TO HEAR VOICES AND SOUNDS AND THEN BEFORE THE HUMMING OF THE BELL HAD DIED AWAY
7402-90848-0029 A YOUTH MOUNTED ON A SPLENDID BLACK HORSE DASHED AT LIGHTNING SPEED OUT OF THE CASTLE AND DISAPPEARED IN THE WOOD AN OLD MAN WITH A WHITE BEARD ACCOMPANIED BY ELEVEN YOUNG MEN WHOM BOBO JUDGED FROM THEIR EXPRESSIONS TO BE BROTHERS
7402-90848-0030 STOOD BY THE GATE TO SEE THE HORSEMAN RIDE AWAY PLUCKING UP COURAGE BOBO CAME FORWARD FELL ON HIS KNEE BEFORE THE OLD MAN AND TOLD HIS STORY TRULY YOU SHOULD THANK THE STORM FAIRIES SAID THE OLD MAN
7402-90848-0031 FOR HAD YOU NOT BEEN WRECKED UPON THIS ISLAND NEVER WOULD YOU HAVE DISCOVERED THE LOST HALF HOUR I AM FATHER TIME HIMSELF AND THESE ARE MY TWELVE SONS THE HOURS EVERY DAY ONE AFTER THE OTHER
7402-90848-0032 THEY RIDE FOR AN HOUR ROUND THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD SEVEN O'CLOCK HAS JUST RIDDEN FORTH YES YOU SHALL HAVE THE LOST HALF HOUR BUT YOU MUST LOOK AFTER MY SONS HORSES FOR THE SPACE OF A WHOLE YEAR TO THIS
7402-90848-0033 BOBO WILLINGLY AGREED SO TWELVE O'CLOCK WHO WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THE HOURS TOOK HIM TO THE STABLES AND SHOWED HIM THE LITTLE ROOM IN THE TURRET THAT HE WAS TO HAVE
7402-90848-0034 HE TOOK SUCH GOOD CARE OF THE GREAT BLACK HORSES OF THE HOURS OF THE NIGHT AND THE WHITE HORSES OF THE HOURS OF THE DAY THAT THEY WERE NEVER MORE PROUD AND STRONG NOR THEIR COATS SMOOTHER AND MORE GLEAMING WHEN THE YEAR WAS UP BOBO AGAIN SOUGHT OUT FATHER TIME
7402-90848-0035 YOU HAVE SERVED FAITHFULLY AND WELL SAID FATHER TIME HERE IS YOUR REWARD AND WITH THESE WORDS HE PLACED IN BOBO'S HANDS A SMALL SQUARE CASKET MADE OF EBONY THE HALF HOUR LIES INSIDE
7402-90848-0036 DON'T TRY TO PEEK AT IT OR OPEN THE BOX UNTIL THE RIGHT TIME HAS COME IF YOU DO THE HALF HOUR WILL FLYAWAY AND DISAPPEAR FOREVER FAREWELL BOBO SAID KIND YOUNG TWELVE O'CLOCK WHO HAD BEEN THE SIMPLETON'S GOOD FRIEND
7402-90848-0037 I TOO HAVE A GIFT FOR THEE DRINK THIS CUP OF WATER TO THE LAST DROP AND THE YOUTH HANDED THE SIMPLETON A SILVER CUP FULL TO THE BRIM OF CLEAR SHINING WATER NOW THIS WATER WAS THE WATER OF WISDOM
7402-90848-0038 AND WHEN BOBO HAD DRUNK IT HE WAS NO LONGER A SIMPLETON AND BEING NO LONGER A SIMPLETON HE REMEMBERED THE MAN WHO HAD LOST HIS REPUTATION THE MAN WHO HAD LOST HIS TEMPER AND THE KING WHOSE DAUGHTER HAD BEEN STOLEN BY THE FAIRIES
7402-90848-0039 TELL THE FIRST SAID FATHER TIME THAT HIS REPUTATION HAS BEEN BROKEN INTO A THOUSAND PIECES WHICH HAVE BEEN PICKED UP BY HIS NEIGHBORS AND CARRIED HOME IF HE CAN PERSUADE HIS NEIGHBORS TO GIVE THEM UP
7402-90848-0040 AS FOR THE MISSING DAUGHTER SHE IS THE KITCHEN MAID IN PRINCESS ZENZA'S PALACE WHO IS KNOWN AS TILDA SO BOBO THANKED FATHER TIME AND AT NOON
7402-90848-0041 TWELVE O'CLOCK PLACED HIM BEHIND HIM ON THE WHITE CHARGER AND HURRIED AWAY SO FAST THEY FLEW THAT BOBO WHO WAS HOLDING THE EBONY CASKET CLOSE AGAINST HIS HEART WAS IN GREAT DANGER OF FALLING OFF
7402-90848-0042 WHEN THEY GOT TO THE SEASHORE THE WHITE HORSE HESITATED NOT AN INSTANT BUT SET FOOT UPON THE WATER WHICH BORE HIM UP AS IF IT HAD BEEN NOT WATER BUT EARTH ITSELF
7402-90848-0043 BOBO WITH GREAT GOODNESS OF HEART TOOK ALONG THIS EXTRAORDINARY OBJECT IN THE HOPE OF FINDING ITS ANGRY POSSESSOR FARTHER ON THE LAD ENCOUNTERED TILDA'S FATHER THE UNHAPPY KING AND DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE
7402-90848-0044 THE JOY OF THE MONARCH KNEW NO BOUNDS AND BOBO THE ONE TIME SIMPLETON BECAME ON THE SPOT LORD BOBO OF THE SAPPHIRE HILLS MARQUIS OF THE MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON PRINCE OF THE VALLEY OF GOLDEN APPLES
7402-90848-0045 IN A WORD THE GREATEST NOBLEMAN IN ALL FAIRYLAND
7402-90848-0046 ALL IN SPLENDID SILKS AND SOLDIERS IN SHINING ARMOR THE DELIGHTED KING RODE OFF TO CLAIM HIS MISSING DAUGHTER FROM PRINCESS ZENZA SO ON THEY RODE THE HARNESSES JINGLING THE BRIDLE BELLS RINGING
7402-90848-0047 AND THE BREASTPLATES OF THE ARMED MEN SHINING IN THE SUN AFTER A WEEK OF ALMOST CONSTANT PROGRESS FOR THE KING WAS SO ANXIOUS TO SEE HIS BELOVED DAUGHTER THAT HE WOULD HARDLY GIVE THE CAVALCADE TIME TO REST
7402-90848-0048 ON THE STEPS OF ONE OF THE COTTAGES SAT AN OLD WOMAN ALL ALONE AND WEEPING WITH ALL HER MIGHT WHAT IS THE MATTER MY GOOD WOMAN SAID THE KING
7402-90848-0049 EVIL DAYS HAVE FALLEN UPON OUR UNHAPPY KINGDOM THREE DAYS AGO A TERRIBLE DRAGON ALIGHTED IN THE GARDENS OF THE PALACE AND SENT WORD TO PRINCESS ZENZA THAT IF WITHIN THREE DAYS SHE DID NOT PROVIDE HIM WITH SOMEONE BRAVE ENOUGH TO GO HOME WITH HIM AND COOK HIS MEALS
7402-90848-0050 AND KEEP HIS CAVERN TIDY HE WOULD BURN OUR FIELDS WITH HIS FIERY BREATH YET WHO I ASK YOU WOULD BE HOUSEKEEPER FOR A DRAGON
7402-90848-0051 THAT WE ARE MOURNING AT TWO O'CLOCK SHE IS TO BE CARRIED OFF BY THE DRAGON IT IS ALMOST TWO NOW ALAS ALAS HARDLY WERE THE WORDS OUT OF HER MOUTH WHEN THE TOWN BELL STRUCK TWICE SOLEMNLY AND SADLY
7402-90848-0052 QUICK QUICK CRIED THE KING AND BOBO IN THE SAME BREATH LET US HURRY TO THE CASTLE WE MAY SAVE HER YET BUT THEY KNEW IN THEIR HEARTS THAT THEY WERE TOO LATE AND THAT POOR TILDA HAD GIVEN HERSELF TO THE DRAGON
7402-90848-0053 AND SO IT PROVED IN SPITE OF HIS MAD DASH BOBO WHO HAD SPURRED ON AHEAD ARRIVED EXACTLY HALF AN HOUR LATE THE MONSTROUS DRAGON WITH TILDA IN HIS CLAWS
7402-90848-0054 THINGS SHOULD BE EXACTLY AS THEY WERE HALF AN HOUR BEFORE HE OPENED THE COVER OF THE EBONY BOX SOMETHING LIKE A WINGED WHITE FLAME ESCAPED FROM IT AND FLEW HISSING THROUGH THE AIR TO THE SUN
7402-90848-0055 AS FOR THE SUN ITSELF TURNING ROUND LIKE A CARTWHEEL AND HISSING LIKE TEN THOUSAND ROCKETS IT ROLLED BACK ALONG THE SKY TO THE EAST THE HANDS OF THE CLOCKS WHICH MARKED HALF PAST TWO WHIRRED BACK TO TWO O'CLOCK IN A TWINKLING
7402-90848-0056 AND SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS BRAVE LITTLE TILDA STANDING ALONE IN A GREAT FIELD WAITING FOR THE DRAGON TO COME AND TAKE HER AWAY LUMBERING HEAVILY ALONG LIKE A MONSTROUS TURTLE AND SNORTING BLUE SMOKE
7402-90848-0057 THE DRAGON WAS ADVANCING TOWARD HER BOBO RAN DOWN INTO THE FIELD AND STOOD BESIDE TILDA READY TO DEFEND HER TO THE END THE DRAGON CAME NEARER AND NEARER SUDDENLY
7402-90848-0058 ANGERED BY THE SIGHT OF BOBO AND HIS DRAWN SWORD HE ROARED ANGRILY BUT CONTINUED TO APPROACH BOBO STRUCK AT HIM WITH HIS SWORD THE BLADE BROKE UPON HIS STEELY SCALES THE DRAGON ROARED AGAIN NOW
7402-90848-0059 JUST AS THE DRAGON'S MOUTH WAS ITS WIDEST BOBO WHO HAD BEEN SEARCHING HIS POCKETS DESPERATELY HURLED INTO IT THE LOST TEMPER THERE WAS A PERFECTLY TERRIFIC BANG AS IF A MILLION BALLOONS HAD BLOWN UP ALL AT ONCE
7402-90848-0060 FOR THE DRAGON HAD BLOWN UP THE LOST TEMPER HAD FINISHED HIM ONLY ONE FRAGMENT OF HIM A TINY BIT OF A CLAW WAS EVER FOUND
7402-90848-0061 THE GRAND CROSS OF THE ORDER OF THE BLACK CAT WAS CONFERRED UPON BOBO BY PRINCESS ZENZA WHO ALSO ASKED HIS PARDON FOR HAVING TREATED HIM SO SHABBILY THIS BOBO GAVE READILY
7402-90848-0062 WHEN THE REJOICINGS WERE OVER
7447-91186-0000 HOW SOON KEYS WERE ADDED TO THE MONOCHORD AS THIS MEASURING INSTRUMENT WAS NAMED CANNOT POSITIVELY BE ASCERTAINED WE MAY SAFELY ASSUME IT WAS NOT SLOW IN ADOPTING THE RUDE KEYBOARD ASCRIBED BY TRADITION TO PAN PIPES
7447-91186-0001 AND APPLIED TO THE PORTABLE ORGAN OF EARLY CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES AFTER THE TENTH CENTURY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MONOCHORD SEEMS TO HAVE BEGUN IN EARNEST TWO OR MORE STRINGS OF EQUAL LENGTH ARE NOW DIVIDED
7447-91186-0002 AND SET IN MOTION BY FLAT METAL WEDGES ATTACHED TO THE KEY LEVERS AND CALLED TANGENTS BECAUSE THEY TOUCHED THE STRINGS IN RESPONSE TO THE DEMAND FOR INCREASED RANGE AS MANY AS TWENTY KEYS
7447-91186-0003 WERE BROUGHT TO ACT ON A FEW STRINGS COMMANDING OFTEN THREE OCTAVES
7447-91186-0004 THE FAMOUS SIGHT READING MUSIC TEACHER OF THE ELEVENTH CENTURY ADVISED HIS PUPILS TO EXERCISE THE HAND IN THE USE OF THE MONOCHORD SHOWING HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE KEYBOARD THE KEYED MONOCHORD GAINED THE NAME
7447-91186-0005 CLAVICHORD ITS BOX LIKE CASE WAS FIRST PLACED ON A TABLE LATER ON ITS OWN STAND AND INCREASED IN ELEGANCE NOT UNTIL THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WAS EACH KEY PROVIDED WITH A SEPARATE STRING
7447-91186-0006 OR KEYBOARD INSTRUMENTS THAT CAME INTO USE DANCE MUSIC FOUND IN THEM A CONGENIAL FIELD
7447-91186-0007 I ANSWER THAT YOU CANNOT YET OWING TO YOUR YOUTH UNDERSTAND THAT PLAYING IS ONLY SUITED FOR VOLATILE FRIVOLOUS WOMEN WHEREAS I DESIRE YOU TO BE THE MOST LOVABLE MAIDEN IN THE WORLD
7447-91186-0008 ALSO IT WOULD BRING YOU BUT LITTLE PLEASURE OR RENOWN IF YOU SHOULD PLAY BADLY
7447-91186-0009 CONSIDER A MOMENT WHETHER THIS WOULD BECOME YOU IF YOUR FRIENDS WISH YOU TO PLAY IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM PLEASURE TELL THEM YOU DO NOT DESIRE TO MAKE YOURSELF RIDICULOUS IN THEIR EYES AND BE CONTENT WITH YOUR BOOKS AND YOUR DOMESTIC OCCUPATIONS
7447-91186-0010 A DIFFERENT VIEW WAS ENTERTAINED IN ENGLAND DURING QUEEN ELIZABETH'S REIGN WHERE CLAVIERS WERE IN VOGUE STYLED VIRGINALS BECAUSE AS AN ANCIENT CHRONICLE EXPLAINED VIRGINS DO MOST COMMONLY PLAY ON THEM
7447-91186-0011 THE VIRGINAL WAS USUALLY OF OBLONG SHAPE OFTEN RESEMBLING A LADY'S WORKBOX WITH THE VIRGIN QUEEN IT WAS A PRIME FAVORITE ALTHOUGH NOT NAMED EXPRESSLY FOR HER AS THE FLATTERING FASHION OF THE TIME LED MANY TO ASSUME
7447-91186-0012 IF SHE ACTUALLY DID JUSTICE TO SOME OF THE AIRS WITH VARIATIONS IN THE QUEEN ELIZABETH VIRGINAL BOOK SHE MUST INDEED HAVE BEEN PROFICIENT ON THE INSTRUMENT QUAINT DOCTOR CHARLES BURNEY
7447-91186-0013 SEVENTEEN TWENTY SIX EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN DECLARES IN HIS HISTORY OF MUSIC THAT NO PERFORMER OF HIS DAY COULD PLAY THEM WITHOUT AT LEAST A MONTH'S PRACTICE
7447-91186-0014 THE CLAVIER GAVE PROMISE OF ITS DESTINED CAREER IN THE ELIZABETHAN AGE SHAKESPEARE IMMORTALIZED IT AND WILLIAM BYRD
7447-91186-0015 BECAME THE FIRST CLAVIER MASTER HE AND DOCTOR JOHN BULL
7447-91186-0016 REPRESENT THE TWO TYPES WHICH RUN THROUGH THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE CLAVIER BYRD WAS THE MORE INTIMATE DELICATE SPIRITUAL INTELLECT BULL THE UNTAMED GENIUS THE BRILLIANT
7447-91186-0017 EXECUTANT THE LESS EXQUISITELY REFINED ARTIST IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT THESE TWO TYPES STAND TOGETHER ON THE THRESHOLD OF CLAVIER ART
7447-91186-0018 THE FOUNDING OF WHOSE CHAIR OF MUSIC IS POPULARLY ATTRIBUTED TO ALFRED THE GREAT AS EARLY AS THE YEAR FOURTEEN HUNDRED CLAVIERS HAD APPEARED WHOSE STRINGS WERE PLUCKED BY QUILLS
7447-91186-0019 ATTACHED TO JACKS AT THE END OF THE KEY LEVERS TO THIS GROUP BELONGED THE VIRGINAL OR VIRGINALS THE CLAVICEMBALO THE HARPSICHORD OR CLAVECIN AND THE SPINET STOPS WERE ADDED AS IN THE ORGAN
7447-91186-0020 THAT VARIED EFFECTS MIGHT BE PRODUCED AND A SECOND KEYBOARD WAS OFTEN PLACED ABOVE THE FIRST THE CASE WAS EITHER RECTANGULAR OR FOLLOWED THE OUTLINES OF THE HARP A PROGENITOR OF THIS CLAVIER TYPE
7447-91186-0021 THE SECULAR MUSIC PRINCIPLE OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY THAT CALLED INTO ACTIVE BEING THE ORCHESTRA LED ALSO TO A DESIRE FOR RICHER MUSICAL EXPRESSION IN HOME AND SOCIAL LIFE THAN THE FASHIONABLE LUTE AFFORDED
7447-91186-0022 AND THE CLAVIER ADVANCED IN FAVOR IN FRANCE BY FIFTEEN THIRTY THE DANCE THAT PROMOTER OF PURE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC WAS FREELY TRANSCRIBED FOR THE CLAVIER LITTLE MORE THAN A CENTURY LATER JEAN BAPTISTE LULLY
7447-91186-0023 EXTENSIVELY EMPLOYED THE INSTRUMENT IN THE ORCHESTRATION OF HIS OPERAS AND WROTE SOLO DANCES FOR IT
7447-91186-0024 NOW WELL NIGH FORGOTTEN ALTHOUGH ONCE MENTIONED IN THE SAME BREATH WITH MOLIERE WROTE THE PIONEER CLAVIER INSTRUCTION BOOK IN IT HE DIRECTS SCHOLARS HOW TO AVOID A HARSH TONE AND HOW TO FORM A LEGATO STYLE
7447-91186-0025 HE ADVISES PARENTS TO SELECT TEACHERS ON WHOM IMPLICIT RELIANCE MAY BE PLACED AND TEACHERS TO KEEP THE CLAVIERS OF BEGINNERS UNDER LOCK AND KEY THAT THERE MAY BE NO PRACTICING WITHOUT SUPERVISION HIS SUGGESTIONS DESERVE CONSIDERATION TO DAY
7447-91186-0026 HE WAS THE FIRST TO ENCOURAGE PROFESSIONAL CLAVIER PLAYING AMONG WOMEN HIS DAUGHTER MARGUERITE WAS THE FIRST WOMAN APPOINTED OFFICIAL COURT CLAVIER PLAYER HE COMPOSED FOR THE CLAVIER LITTLE PICTURE TUNES
7447-91186-0027 DESIGNED TO DEPICT SENTIMENTS MOODS PHASES OF CHARACTER AND SCENES FROM LIFE HE FASHIONED MANY CHARMING TURNS OF EXPRESSION INTRODUCED AN OCCASIONAL TEMPO RUBATO FORESHADOWED THE INTELLECTUAL
7447-91186-0028 ELEMENT IN MUSIC AND LAID THE CORNER STONE OF MODERN PIANO PLAYING JEAN PHILIPPE RAMEAU
7447-91186-0029 CONTINUED COUPERIN'S WORK WHAT IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS THE FIRST PERIOD OF CLAVIER VIRTUOSITY BEGINS WITH THE NEAPOLITAN DOMENICO SCARLATTI
7447-91186-0030 AND JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH
7447-91186-0031 THE GERMAN OF GERMANS THE STYLE OF SCARLATTI IS PECULIARLY THE PRODUCT OF ITALIAN LOVE OF BEAUTIFUL TONE
7447-91186-0032 KEPT WELL IN VIEW THE TECHNICAL POSSIBILITIES OF THE HARPSICHORD HIS CAT'S FUGUE AND HIS ONE MOVEMENT SONATAS STILL APPEAR ON CONCERT PROGRAMMES IN A COLLECTION OF THIRTY SONATAS HE EXPLAINED HIS PURPOSE IN THESE WORDS
7447-91186-0033 AMATEUR OR PROFESSOR WHOEVER THOU ART SEEK NOT IN THESE COMPOSITIONS FOR ANY PROFOUND FEELING THEY ARE ONLY A FROLIC OF ART MEANT TO INCREASE THY CONFIDENCE IN THE CLAVIER
7447-91186-0034 IN GERMANY WITH GRAND OLD FATHER BACH THE KEYBOARD INSTRUMENT WAS FOUND CAPABLE OF MIRRORING A MIGHTY SOUL THE GERM OF ALL MODERN MUSICAL DESIGN LIES IN HIS CLAVIER WRITINGS
7447-91186-0035 IT HAS BEEN APTLY SAID OF THIS MASTER OF MASTERS THAT HE CONSTRUCTED A GREAT UNIVERSITY OF MUSIC FROM WHICH ALL MUST GRADUATE WHO WOULD ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING OF VALUE IN MUSIC MEN OF GENIUS FROM MOZART TO THE PRESENT TIME
7447-91186-0036 HAVE EXTOLLED HIM FOR THE BEAUTY OF HIS MELODIES AND HARMONIES THE EXPRESSIVENESS OF HIS MODULATIONS THE WEALTH SPONTANEITY AND LOGICAL CLEARNESS OF HIS IDEAS AND THE SUPERB ARCHITECTURE OF HIS PRODUCTIONS
7447-91186-0037 STUDENTS MISS THE SOUL OF BACH BECAUSE OF THE SOULLESS MECHANICAL WAY IN WHICH THEY DEFACE HIS LEGACY TO THEM HIS TWELVE LITTLE PRELUDES ALONE CONTAIN THE MATERIALS FOR AN ENTIRE SYSTEM OF MUSIC THE INVENTIONS
7447-91186-0038 TOO OFTEN TREATED AS DRY AS DUST STUDIES ARE LADEN WITH BEAUTIFUL FIGURES AND DEVICES THAT FURNISH INSPIRATION FOR ALL TIME AS INDICATED BY THEIR TITLE WHICH SIGNIFIES A COMPOUND OF APPROPRIATE EXPRESSION
7447-91186-0039 AND JUST DISPOSITION OF THE MEMBERS THEY WERE DESIGNED TO CULTIVATE THE ELEMENTS OF MUSICAL TASTE AS WELL AS FREEDOM AND EQUALITY OF THE FINGERS HIS WELL TEMPERED CLAVICHORD HAS BEEN CALLED THE PIANIST'S SACRED BOOK
7447-91186-0040 ITS PRELUDES AND FUGUES ILLUSTRATE EVERY SHADE OF HUMAN FEELING AND WERE ESPECIALLY DESIGNED TO EXEMPLIFY THE MODE OF TUNING KNOWN AS EQUAL TEMPERAMENT INTRODUCED INTO GENERAL USE BY BACH
7447-91186-0041 AND STILL EMPLOYED BY YOUR PIANO TUNER AND MINE FORKEL HIS BIOGRAPHER HAS FINELY SAID THAT BACH CONSIDERED THE VOICES OF HIS FUGUES A SELECT COMPANY OF PERSONS CONVERSING TOGETHER
7447-91186-0042 EACH WAS ALLOWED TO SPEAK ONLY WHEN THERE WAS SOMETHING TO SAY BEARING ON THE SUBJECT IN HAND A HIGHLY CHARACTERISTIC MOTIVE OR THEME AS SIGNIFICANT AS THE NOBLEST TYPICAL PHRASE
7447-91186-0043 DEVELOPING INTO EQUALLY CHARACTERISTIC PROGRESSIONS AND CADENCES IS A STRIKING FEATURE OF THE BACH FUGUE HIS SUITES EXALTED FOREVER THE FAMILIAR DANCE TUNES OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE HIS WONDERFUL CHROMATIC FANTASIA AND FUGUE
7447-91187-0000 THE PIANO BARD THE PIANO RHAPSODIST THE PIANO MIND THE PIANO SOUL IS CHOPIN SAID RUBINSTEIN TRAGIC ROMANTIC LYRIC HEROIC DRAMATIC FANTASTIC SOULFUL
7447-91187-0001 SWEET DREAMY BRILLIANT GRAND SIMPLE ALL POSSIBLE EXPRESSIONS ARE FOUND IN HIS COMPOSITIONS AND ALL ARE SUNG BY HIM ON HIS INSTRUMENT
7447-91187-0002 IN THESE FEW BOLD STROKES ONE WHO KNEW HIM BY VIRTUE OF CLOSE ART AND RACE KINSHIP PRESENTS AN INCOMPARABLE OUTLINE SKETCH OF THE POLISH TONE POET
7447-91187-0003 WHO EXPLORED THE HARMONIC VASTNESS OF THE PIANOFORTE AND MADE HIS OWN ALL ITS MYSTIC SECRETS BORN AND BRED ON POLAND'S SOIL SON OF A FRENCH FATHER AND A POLISH MOTHER FREDERIC CHOPIN
7447-91187-0004 COMBINED WITHIN HIMSELF TWO NATURES EACH COMPLEMENTING THE OTHER BOTH UNITING TO FORM A PERSONALITY NOT UNDERSTOOD BY EVERY CASUAL OBSERVER HE IS DESCRIBED AS KIND COURTEOUS
7447-91187-0005 POSSESSED OF THE MOST CAPTIVATING GRACE AND EASE OF MANNER NOW INCLINED TO LANGUOROUS MELANCHOLY NOW SCINTILLATING WITH A JOYOUS VIVACITY THAT WAS CONTAGIOUS
7447-91187-0006 HIS SENSITIVE NATURE LIKE THE MOST EXQUISITELY CONSTRUCTED SOUNDING BOARD VIBRATED WITH THE DESPAIRING SADNESS THE SUPPRESSED WRATH AND THE SUBLIME FORTITUDE OF THE BRAVE HAUGHTY
7447-91187-0007 UNHAPPY PEOPLE HE LOVED AND WITH HIS OWN HOMESICKNESS WHEN AFAR FROM HIS CHERISHED NATIVE LAND PATRIOT AND TONE POET IN EVERY FIBRE OF HIS BEING
7447-91187-0008 HIS GENIUS INEVITABLY CLAIMED AS ITS OWN THE SOUL'S DIVINEST LANGUAGE PURE MUSIC UNFETTERED BY WORDS THE PROFOUND RESERVE OF HIS NATURE MADE IT PECULIARLY
7447-91187-0009 AGREEABLE TO HIM TO GRATIFY THE HAUNTING DEMANDS OF HIS LYRIC MUSE THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE ONE MUSICAL INSTRUMENT THAT LENDS ITSELF IN PRIVACY TO THE EXPLOITATION OF ALL THE MYSTERIES OF HARMONY
7447-91187-0010 STRONG CONVICTION IN REGARD TO HIS OWN CALLING AND CLEAR PERCEPTION OF THE HIDDEN POWERS AND FUTURE MISSION OF THE PIANO EARLY COMPELLED HIM TO CONSECRATE TO IT HIS UNFALTERING DEVOTION
7447-91187-0011 HE EVOLVED FROM ITS MORE INTIMATE DOMAIN EFFECTS IN SYMPATHY WITH THOSE OF THE ORCHESTRA YET PURELY INDIVIDUAL HE ENRICHED IT WITH NEW MELODIC HARMONIC AND RHYTHMIC DEVICES ADAPTED TO ITSELF ALONE
7447-91187-0012 AND ENDOWED IT WITH A WARMTH OF TONE COLORING THAT SPIRITUALIZED IT FOR ALL TIME TO THE PIANO HE CONFIDED ALL THE CONFLICTS THAT RAGED WITHIN HIM ALL THE COURAGE AND LIVING HOPE THAT SUSTAINED HIM
7447-91187-0013 IN GIVING TONAL FORM TO THE DEEP THINGS OF THE SOUL WHICH ARE UNIVERSAL IN THEIR ESSENCE AND APPLICATION HE EMBODIED UNIVERSAL RATHER THAN MERELY INDIVIDUAL EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCES
7447-91187-0014 AND THUS UNBARED WHAT WAS MOST SACRED TO HIMSELF WITHOUT JARRING ON THE INNATE RETICENCE WHICH MADE PURELY PERSONAL CONFIDENCES IMPOSSIBLE
7447-91187-0015 ALTHOUGH HIS MODE OF EXPRESSION WAS PECULIARLY HIS OWN HE HAD RECEIVED A STRONG IMPULSE FROM THE POPULAR MUSIC OF POLAND
7447-91187-0016 THEY WERE HIS EARLIEST MODELS ON THEM WERE BUILDED HIS FIRST THEMES
7447-91187-0017 SO CHOPIN GLORIFIED THOSE OF THE POLES THE NATIONAL TONALITY BECAME TO HIM A VEHICLE TO BE FREIGHTED WITH HIS OWN INDIVIDUAL CONCEPTIONS I SHOULD LIKE TO BE TO MY PEOPLE
7447-91187-0018 WHAT UHLAND WAS TO THE GERMANS HE ONCE SAID TO A FRIEND HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE HEART OF THIS PEOPLE AND IMMORTALIZED ITS JOYS SORROWS AND CAPRICES BY THE FORCE OF HIS SPLENDID ART
7447-91187-0019 THOSE WHO HAVE ATTEMPTED TO INTERPRET HIM AS THE SENTIMENTAL HERO OF MINOR MOODS THE TONE POET IN WHOM THE WEAKNESS OF DESPAIR PREDOMINATES HAVE MISSED THE LEAPING FLAMES THE VIVID INTENSITY
7447-91187-0020 TRUE ART SOFTENS THE HARSHEST ACCENTS OF SUFFERING BY PLACING SUPERIOR TO IT SOME ELEVATING IDEA SO IN THE MOST MELANCHOLY STRAINS OF HIS MUSIC ONE WHO HEEDS WELL MAY DETECT THE PRESENCE OF A LOFTY IDEAL
7447-91187-0021 THAT UPLIFTS AND STRENGTHENS THE TRAVAILING SOUL IT HAS BEEN SAID OF HIM THAT HE HAD A SAD HEART BUT A JOYFUL MIND THE TWO TEACHERS OF CHOPIN WERE
7447-91187-0022 ZWYNY A BOHEMIAN VIOLINIST WHO TAUGHT THE PIANO AND JOSEPH ELSNER A VIOLINIST ORGANIST AND THEORIST FROM ZWYNY AND ELSNER EVEN THE GREATEST DUNCE MUST LEARN SOMETHING HE IS QUOTED AS SAYING
7447-91187-0023 NEITHER OF THESE MEN ATTEMPTED TO HAMPER HIS FREE GROWTH BY RIGID TECHNICAL RESTRAINTS THEIR GUIDANCE LEFT HIM MASTER OF HIS OWN GENIUS AT LIBERTY TO SOAR LIKE THE LARK INTO THE ETHEREAL BLUE OF THE SKIES
7447-91187-0024 HE RESPECTED THEM BOTH A REVERING AFFECTION WAS CHERISHED BY HIM FOR ELSNER TO WHOM HE OWED HIS SENSE OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO HIS ART HIS HABITS OF SERIOUS STUDY
7447-91187-0025 AND HIS INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH BACH THERE IS FOOD FOR THOUGHT IN THE FACT THAT THIS PRINCE CHARMING OF THE PIANO WHOSE MAGIC TOUCH AWAKENED THE SLEEPING BEAUTY OF THE INSTRUMENT OF WOOD AND WIRES NEVER HAD A LESSON IN HIS LIFE
7447-91187-0026 FROM A MERE PIANO SPECIALIST LISZT ONCE SAID CHOPIN WAS THE ONLY PIANIST HE EVER KNEW THAT COULD PLAY THE VIOLIN ON THE PIANO IF HE COULD DO SO IT WAS BECAUSE HE HAD HARKENED TO THE VOICE OF THE VIOLIN
7447-91187-0027 AND RESOLVED TO SHOW THAT THE PIANO TOO COULD PRODUCE THRILLING EFFECTS IN THE SAME WAY HE HAD LISTENED TO THE HUMAN VOICE AND DETERMINED THAT THE SONG OF HIS OWN INSTRUMENT SHOULD BE HEARD
7447-91187-0028 THOSE WHO GIVE EAR TO THE PIANO ALONE WILL NEVER LEARN THE SECRET OF CALLING FORTH ITS SUPREME ELOQUENCE WE CAN SEE AND HEAR THIS RAPHAEL OF MUSIC AT THE PIANO
7447-91187-0029 SO MANY AND SO ELOQUENT HAVE BEEN THE DESCRIPTIONS GIVEN OF HIS PLAYING IT IS EASY TO FANCY HIM SWEEPING THE IVORY KEYS WITH HIS GOSSAMER TOUCH THAT ENVELOPED WITH ETHEREAL BEAUTY
7447-91187-0030 THE MOST UNACCUSTOMED OF HIS COMPLICATED CHROMATIC MODULATIONS WE CAN FEEL HIS INDIVIDUALITY PULSATING THROUGH EVERY TONE EVOKED BY THOSE INDIVIDUALIZED FINGERS OF HIS AS THEY WEAVE MEASURES FOR SYLPHS
7447-91187-0031 WE MARVEL AT HIS SOFTLY WHISPERED YET EVER CLEARLY DISTINCT PIANISSIMO AT THE FULL ROUND TONE OF ITS RELATIVE FORTISSIMO THAT WAS NEVER HARSH OR NOISY
7447-91187-0032 AND AT ALL THE EXQUISITELY GRADED NUANCES THAT LAY BETWEEN WITH THOSE TIME FLUCTUATIONS EXPRESSIVE OF THE EBB AND FLOW OF HIS POETIC INNER BEING
7447-91187-0033 NO WONDER BALZAC MAINTAINED THAT IF CHOPIN SHOULD BUT DRUM ON THE TABLE HIS FINGERS WOULD EVOKE SUBTLE SOUNDING MUSIC AND WHAT AN EXAMPLE HE HAS LEFT FOR TEACHERS DELICATELY STRUNG AS HE WAS
7447-91187-0034 HE MUST OFTEN HAVE ENDURED TORTURES FROM THE BEST OF HIS PUPILS BUT SO THOROUGHLY WAS HE CONSECRATED TO HIS ART THAT HE NEVER FALTERED IN HIS EFFORTS TO LIFT THOSE WHO CONFIDED IN HIM
7447-91187-0035 TO THE AERIAL HEIGHTS HE HAD FOUND A VIVID PICTURE OF HIS METHOD OF TEACHING IS GIVEN IN THE LECTURES ON FREDERIC CHOPIN'S WORKS AND THEIR PROPER INTERPRETATION BY THE POLE JEAN KLECZYNSKI
7447-91187-0036 THE BASIS OF THIS METHOD CONSISTED IN REFINEMENT OF TOUCH FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF WHICH A NATURAL EASY POSITION OF THE HAND WAS CONSIDERED BY CHOPIN A PRIME REQUISITE HE PREPARED EACH HAND WITH INFINITE CARE
7447-91187-0037 BEFORE PERMITTING ANY ATTEMPT AT THE REPRODUCTION OF MUSICAL IDEAS IN ORDER TO PLACE IT TO ADVANTAGE HE CAUSED IT TO BE THROWN LIGHTLY ON THE KEYBOARD SO THAT THE FIVE FINGERS RESTED ON THE NOTES E F SHARP G SHARP A SHARP AND B
7447-91187-0038 AND WITHOUT CHANGE OF POSITION REQUIRED THE PRACTICE OF EXERCISES CALCULATED TO INSURE INDEPENDENCE THE PUPIL WAS INSTRUCTED TO GO THROUGH THESE EXERCISES FIRST STACCATO EFFECTED BY A FREE MOVEMENT OF THE WRIST
7447-91187-0039 AN ADMIRABLE MEANS OF COUNTERACTING HEAVINESS AND CLUMSINESS THEN LEGATO STACCATO THEN ACCENTED LEGATO THEN PURE LEGATO
7447-91187-0040 AND THE MOVEMENT FROM ANDANTE TO PRESTISSIMO HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY PARTICULAR ABOUT ARPEGGIO WORK AND INSISTED UPON THE REPETITION OF EVERY NOTE AND PASSAGE UNTIL ALL HARSHNESS AND ROUGHNESS OF TONE WERE ELIMINATED
7447-91187-0041 HE NEVER HESITATED ABOUT PLACING IT ON A BLACK KEY WHEN CONVENIENT AND HAD IT PASSED BY MUSCLE ACTION ALONE IN SCALES AND BROKEN CHORDS WHOSE ZEALOUS PRACTICE IN DIFFERENT FORMS OF TOUCH ACCENT RHYTHM AND TONE
7447-91187-0042 WERE DEMANDED BY HIM INDIVIDUALIZATION OF THE FINGERS WAS ONE OF HIS STRONG POINTS AND HE BELIEVED IN ASSIGNING TO EACH OF THEM ITS APPROPRIATE PART IN A GOOD MECHANISM HE SAID
7447-91187-0043 THE AIM IS NOT TO PLAY EVERYTHING WITH AN EQUAL SOUND BUT TO ACQUIRE BEAUTIFUL QUALITY OF TOUCH AND PERFECT SHADING OF PRIME IMPORTANCE IN HIS EYES WAS A CLEAR ELASTIC SINGING TONE
7447-91187-0044 ONE WHOSE EXQUISITE DELICACY COULD NEVER BE CONFOUNDED WITH FEEBLENESS
7447-91187-0045 AND HE KNEW HOW TO AUGMENT THE WARMTH AND RICHNESS OF TONE COLORING BY SETTING IN VIBRATION SYMPATHETIC HARMONICS OF THE PRINCIPAL NOTES THROUGH JUDICIOUS EMPLOYMENT OF THE DAMPER PEDAL
7447-91187-0046 BY PRECEPT AND EXAMPLE HE ADVOCATED FREQUENT PLAYING OF THE PRELUDES AND FUGUES OF BACH AS A MEANS OF CULTIVATING MUSICAL INTELLIGENCE MUSCULAR INDEPENDENCE AND TOUCH AND TONE DISCRIMINATION HIS MUSICAL HEROES WERE BACH AND MOZART
7447-91187-0047 FOR THEY REPRESENTED TO HIM NATURE STRONG INDIVIDUALITY AND POETRY IN MUSIC AT ONE TIME HE UNDERTOOK TO WRITE A METHOD OR SCHOOL OF PIANO PLAYING BUT NEVER PROGRESSED BEYOND THE OPENING SENTENCES
7447-91187-0048 A MESSAGE DIRECTLY FROM HIM WOULD HAVE BEEN INVALUABLE TO STUDENTS AND MIGHT HAVE AVERTED MANY UNLUCKY MISAPPREHENSIONS OF HIMSELF AND HIS WORKS THOSE OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES WHO HAVE HARKENED WITH RAPTURE TO HIS PLAYING HAVE DECLARED THAT HE ALONE
7447-91187-0049 COULD ADEQUATELY INTERPRET HIS TONE CREATIONS OR MAKE PERFECTLY INTELLIGIBLE HIS METHOD PUPILS OF HIS AND THEIR PUPILS HAVE FAITHFULLY ENDEAVORED TO TRANSMIT TO THE MUSICAL WORLD THE TRADITION OF HIS INDIVIDUAL STYLE
7447-91187-0050 THE ELECT FEW HAVE COME INTO TOUCH WITH HIS VISION OF BEAUTY BUT IT HAS BEEN MERCILESSLY MISINTERPRETED BY THOUSANDS OF RUTHLESS ASPIRANTS TO MUSICAL HONORS IN THE SCHOOLROOM THE STUDENTS RECITAL AND THE CONCERT HALL
7447-91187-0051 WHOEVER PLAYS CHOPIN WITH SLEDGE HAMMER FINGERS WILL DEADEN ALL SENSE OF HIS POETRY CHARM AND GRACE WHOEVER APPROACHES HIM WITH WEAK SENTIMENTALISM WILL MISS ALTOGETHER HIS DIGNITY AND STRENGTH
7447-91187-0052 IT HAS BEEN SAID OF HIM THAT HE WAS WOMAN IN HIS TENDERNESS AND REALIZATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL AND MAN IN HIS ENERGY AND FORCE OF MIND THE HIGHEST TYPE OF ARTIST AND HUMAN BEING IS THUS REPRESENTED
7447-91187-0053 TO INTERPRET HIM REQUIRES SIMPLICITY PURITY OF STYLE REFINED TECHNIQUE POETIC IMAGINATION AND GENUINE SENTIMENT NOT FITFUL FICTITIOUS SENTIMENTALITY
7447-91187-0054 SERENELY FANCYING THEY ARE HEEDING THE MASTER'S DESIGN RECKLESS OUT OF TIME PLAYING DISFIGURES WHAT IS MEANT TO EXPRESS THE FLUCTUATION OF THOUGHT THE SOUL'S AGITATION THE ROLLING OF THE WAVES OF TIME AND ETERNITY
7447-91187-0055 THE RUBATO FROM RUBARE TO ROB REPRESENTS A PLIABLE MOVEMENT THAT IS CERTAINLY AS OLD AS THE GREEK DRAMA IN DECLAMATION AND WAS EMPLOYED IN INTONING THE GREGORIAN CHANT
7447-91187-0056 INDICATIONS OF IT IN BACH ARE TOO OFTEN NEGLECTED BEETHOVEN USED IT EFFECTIVELY CHOPIN APPROPRIATED IT AS ONE OF HIS MOST POTENT AUXILIARIES IN PLAYING HE EMPHASIZED THE SAYING OF MOZART
7447-91187-0057 ITS LEAVES TREMBLE WITH EVERY BREATH OF THE WIND BUT THE TREE REMAINS UNSHAKEN THAT IS THE RUBATO THERE ARE STORMS TO WHICH EVEN THE TREE YIELDS TO REALIZE THEM TO DIVINE THE LAWS WHICH REGULATE THE UNDULATING TEMPEST TOSSED RUBATO
7447-91187-0058 REQUIRES HIGHLY MATURED ARTISTIC TASTE AND ABSOLUTE MUSICAL CONTROL TOO SENSITIVE TO ENJOY PLAYING BEFORE MISCELLANEOUS AUDIENCES WHOSE UNSYMPATHETIC CURIOSITY HE DECLARED PARALYZED HIM
7447-91187-0059 CHOPIN WAS AT HIS BEST WHEN INTERPRETING MUSIC IN PRIVATE FOR A CHOICE CIRCLE OF FRIENDS OR PUPILS OR WHEN ABSORBED IN COMPOSITION IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY FOR HIM THAT HE USHERED IN A NEW ERA FOR HIS CHOSEN INSTRUMENT
7447-91187-0060 SPIRITUALIZING ITS TIMBRE LIBERATING IT FROM TRADITIONAL ORCHESTRAL AND CHORAL EFFECTS AND ELEVATING IT TO AN INDEPENDENT POWER IN THE WORLD OF MUSIC BESIDES ENRICHING THE TECHNIQUE OF THE PIANO HE AUGMENTED THE MATERIALS OF MUSICAL EXPRESSION
7447-91187-0061 HARMONY AND RHYTHM NEW CHORD EXTENSIONS PASSAGES OF DOUBLE NOTES ARABESQUES AND HARMONIC COMBINATIONS WERE DEVISED BY HIM
7447-91187-0062 AND HE SO SYSTEMATIZED THE USE OF THE PEDALS THAT THE MOST VARIED NUANCES COULD BE PRODUCED BY THEM IN MELODY AND GENERAL CONCEPTION HIS TONE POEMS SPRANG SPONTANEOUSLY FROM HIS GLOWING FANCY
7447-91187-0063 BUT THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO THE MOST SEVERE TESTS BEFORE THEY WERE PERMITTED TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD EVERY INGENIOUS DEVICE THAT GAVE CHARACTER TO HIS EXQUISITE CANTILENA AND SOFTENED HIS MOST STARTLING CHORD PROGRESSIONS
7447-91187-0064 DISCUSSING THE COMPOSITIONS OF CHOPIN IN HIS DELIGHTFUL AND INSPIRING BOOK CHOPIN THE MAN AND HIS MUSIC CALLS THE STUDIES TITANIC EXPERIMENTS
7447-91187-0065 THE PRELUDES MOODS IN MINIATURE THE NOCTURNES NIGHT AND ITS MELANCHOLY MYSTERIES
7447-91187-0066 FAERY DRAMAS THE POLONAISES HEROIC HYMNS OF BATTLE THE VALSES AND MAZURKAS
7447-91187-0067 TO WRITE OF THE FOUR IMPROMPTUS IN THEIR OWN KEY OF UNRESTRAINED FEELING AND PONDERED INTENTION WOULD NOT BE AS EASY AS RECAPTURING THE FIRST CARELESS RAPTURE OF THE LARK UNQUESTIONABLY
7447-91187-0068 THE POETRY OF CHOPIN IS OF THE MOST EXQUISITE LYRIC CHARACTER HIS LEADERSHIP IS SUPREME SO ORIGINAL WAS HIS CONCEPTION SO FINISHED HIS WORKMANSHIP SO SUBLIME HIS PURPOSE
7447-91187-0069 THAT WE MAY WELL EXCLAIM WITH SCHUMANN HE IS THE BOLDEST PROUDEST POETIC SPIRIT OF THE TIME HIS GREATNESS IS HIS ARISTOCRACY SAYS OSCAR BIE HE STANDS AMONG MUSICIANS IN HIS FAULTLESS VESTURE
7505-258958-0000 SATISFACTION AND GRATIFICATION BEING ONLY TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ECONOMIC WANTS APPEAR IN MORE OR LESS REGULARLY RECURRING SERIES IMPRESSIONS ARE SHORT LIVED SENSATIONS ARE TEMPORARY
7505-258958-0001 WANTS THAT HAVE BEEN SATISFIED RECUR WANTS RECUR FOR THE SAME REASON THAT THEY FIRST AROSE NO IMPRESSION ON THE NERVES OR ON THE SENSES IS LASTING
7505-258958-0002 THE UTILITY TO THAT PERSON OF THAT THING OR SERVICE FOR THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT FALLS IT MAY BE EVEN TO ZERO TO KEEP WANTS SATISFIED IS IMPOSSIBLE WE CANNOT DO NEXT YEAR'S READING OR NEXT WEEK'S EATING NOW
7505-258958-0003 IN ITS POWER TO GRATIFY WANTS THE CLOSER THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SERIES THAT OF WANTS AND THAT OF GOODS THE GREATER WILL BE THE TOTAL OF GRATIFICATION
7505-258958-0004 OR BY SOCIETY DURING THE INCOME PERIOD THE TERM NATIONAL OR SOCIAL INCOME MAY BE CONTRASTED WITH INDIVIDUAL OR PRIVATE INCOME IN THE OBJECTIVE SENSE
7505-258958-0005 ONLY WHEN GOODS ARE PRODUCED INDIVIDUALS MAY ACQUIRE INCOME BY GIFT BEQUEST THEFT OR OTHER MODES OF TRANSFER FROM OTHER INDIVIDUALS IN MANY CASES THE TWO KINDS OF INCOME HOWEVER AGREE
7505-258958-0006 THE OBJECTIVE INCOME OF SOCIETY BEING THE ALGEBRAIC SUM OF THE GOODS ACQUIRED OR PARTED WITH BY ALL THE INDIVIDUALS WE SHOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THAT EITHER SOCIAL OR PRIVATE OBJECTIVE INCOMES INCLUDE ONLY MATERIAL GOODS
7505-258958-0007 FOR MANY UTILITIES AND LABOR SERVICES THAT NEVER TAKE ON A MATERIAL OR MONEY EXPRESSION ARE INCLUDED IN EITHER CASE INDEED WE ARE CLOSE HERE TO THE CONCEPTION OF PSYCHIC INCOME
7505-258958-0008 MUST BE A NET ADDITION BUT THE TERM GROSS INCOME IS NOT WITHOUT POPULAR AND PRACTICAL MEANING GROSS INCOME IS SOMETIMES SPOKEN OF IN THE SENSE OF TOTAL RECEIPTS
7505-258958-0009 AS THE TOTAL OF GOODS SECURED NET INCOME IS THE REMAINDER AFTER DEDUCTING EXPENDITURES AND AFTER REPLACING THE GOODS EMPLOYED TO SECURE THE INCOME IN ORDER TO PRODUCE SOME GOODS TECHNICALLY
7505-258958-0010 MEN MAKE USE OF OTHER GOODS WHILE THEY ARE STORING UP A SUPPLY OF WOOD OR COAL IT MAY BE LOOKED UPON AS THE INCOME BUT THEY MAY BURN IT TO HELP GROW HOTHOUSE PLANTS
7505-258958-0011 WHILE THEY GATHER FLOWERS WITH ONE HAND THEY DESTROY FUEL WITH THE OTHER ONLY THE NET INCREASE IN VALUE CAN BE ACCOUNTED INCOME IN THE SECOND PERIOD
7505-258958-0012 THE GOODS THAT COME INTO A MAN'S POSSESSION IN ANY PERIOD ARE OF MANY SORTS TO GET SOME HE HAS DESTROYED MANY PREVIOUSLY EXISTING GOODS
7505-258958-0013 WHILE TO GET OTHERS HE HAS NOT NEEDED TO USE UP THE ACCUMULATIONS OF THE PAST OR TO MORTGAGE THE FUTURE THE ONE KIND IS GROSS THE OTHER NET INCOME
7505-258958-0014 OF A SERIES OF GRATIFICATIONS IS A REGULAR SERIES OF CONSUMPTION GOODS BUT MANY THINGS EXISTING WHICH COULD BE USED TO SECURE A GRATIFICATION ARE NOT IN FACT TREATED AS CONSUMPTION GOODS
7505-258958-0015 A CROP OF CORN IS NOT ALL INCOME IN A TIME OF FAMINE IT COULD BE USED BUT SEED CORN WAS SAVED FROM LAST YEAR
7505-258958-0016 IT IS TRUE THAT EVERYTHING CALLED WEALTH IS EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE SOONER OR LATER IN SOME WAY TO THE SUM OF GRATIFICATIONS IT IS FOR THAT REASON IT IS CALLED WEALTH IT IS HOWEVER
7505-258958-0017 A MERE FIGURE OF SPEECH TO SAY INDIRECT WANT GRATIFIERS BECOME WANT GRATIFYING GOODS FOR EXAMPLE THE ENGINE TRANSPORTING A LOAD OF COAL IS INDIRECTLY GRATIFYING WANTS
7505-258958-0018 BETWEEN PRESENT AND FUTURE INCOMES THE VALUE OF THE MASS OF WEALTH IN POSSESSION AND YIELDING INCOME RESTS IN LARGE PART UPON ITS POWER OF CONTRIBUTING TO INCOME IN SOME FUTURE PERIOD THUS
7505-258958-0019 SUCH AS LANDS RAILROAD STOCKS GOVERNMENT BONDS ET CETERA THE INCOME IS FUNDED BECAUSE IT CORRESPONDS TO AN ABIDING FUND OF WEALTH THE INCOME ARISING FROM CURRENT LABOR IS UNFUNDED
7505-258958-0020 BECAUSE THERE IS NO PERMANENT FUND OF ACCUMULATED WEALTH CORRESPONDING TO IT THE IDEA OF REGULARITY CONNECTED WITH FUNDED INCOME IS NOT ESSENTIAL TO THE IDEA OF INCOME IN GENERAL
7505-258958-0021 IF IT IS PART OF THE SUM OF GOODS THAT FLOWS IN THAT IS NEWLY AVAILABLE FOR THE MAN'S USE IT IS INCOME BUT FUNDED INCOME IS THE MORE ABIDING FOR INCOME FROM WAGES STOPS
7505-258958-0022 THE REAL INCOME BUT CERTAINLY IT IS NOT INCOME IN THE MOST ESSENTIAL SENSE THINGS OUTSIDE OF MEN CANNOT BE FEELINGS THEY CAN ONLY CALL OUT OR OCCASION FEELING
7505-258958-0023 AND REDUCIBLE TO PSYCHIC INCOME SOME PORTIONS AT LEAST OF THE OBJECTIVE INCOMES OF GOODS ARE CONTINUALLY BY USE BECOMING SUBJECTIVE INCOMES OF ENJOYMENT
7505-258958-0024 MEN TALK OF MATERIAL INCOME AS CONSISTING OF BUSHELS OF WHEAT HEAD OF CATTLE ET CETERA AND OF IMMATERIAL INCOME AS THE USES THAT DURABLE GOODS YIELD DIRECTLY
7505-258958-0025 OR THAT MEN PERFORM FOR EACH OTHER E G THOSE OF THE SINGER PHYSICIAN TEACHER JUDGE ALL SERVICES THAT DO NOT TAKE ON MATERIAL FORM
7505-258958-0026 THERE WAS A LONG STANDING DISPUTE IN ECONOMIC LITERATURE REGARDING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRODUCTIVE AND UNPRODUCTIVE LABOR PRODUCTIVE LABOR WAS SAID TO BE THAT WHICH EMBODIED ITSELF IN ABIDING MATERIAL FORM
7505-258958-0027 THE DISTINCTION LED TO SOME PECULIAR PUZZLES AND PARADOXES THE BARTENDER MIXING DRINKS ADDS TO THE VALUE OF THOSE INGREDIENTS IN A MINUTE THAT VALUE IS DISSIPATED
7505-258958-0028 ACCORDING TO THE DISTINCTION IN QUESTION HE IS A PRODUCTIVE LABORER BECAUSE HIS SERVICES ARE EMBODIED IN MATERIAL FORM WHEREAS THE LECTURER IS REGARDED AS AN UNPRODUCTIVE LABORER
7505-258958-0029 BUT WHETHER OR NOT THE SERVICE HAS FOR A MOMENT EMBODIED ITSELF IN MATERIAL FORM IS OF NO ESSENTIAL ECONOMIC IMPORT
7505-258958-0030 BUT A SIMILAR DISTINCTION IS INCONSISTENTLY PRESERVED BY MANY WRITERS IN THE CASE OF MATERIAL THINGS A BUILDING USED AS A FACTORY IS CALLED PRODUCTIVE
7505-258958-0031 BUT USED BY THE OWNER AS A DWELLING IT IS CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE BECAUSE THE SERVICE IT RENDERS DOES NOT APPEAR IN MATERIAL FORM BUT THE USE OF THE HOUSE OR THAT OF LAND FOR A SCHOOL GROUND OR CAMPUS
7505-258958-0032 AND THUS HIS FELT DEPENDENCE ON GOODS EXTENDS OVER A SERIES OF FUTURE PRODUCTIVE AGENTS IN ORDER TO SIMPLIFY THE PROBLEM WE HAVE SPOKEN OF THE ECONOMIC MAN AS LIVING ONLY IN AND FOR THE MOMENT
7505-258958-0033 IF HE HAD NO MORE KNOWLEDGE MEMORY OR IMAGINATION THAN IS NECESSARY TO COMPARE GOODS HERE ONLY PRESENT GOODS COULD HAVE VALUE TO HIM EVEN THE HIGHER ANIMALS AND MUCH MORE THE SAVAGES
7505-258958-0034 TO BE USED BY A HUNGRY MAN FOR FOOD FOR A SHEEP TO BE KEPT FOR BREEDING OR FOR WOOL TO BE MADE INTO CLOTH NEXT YEAR HE MAY OVERLOOK THE DIFFERENCE IN THE GRADE OF WANTS COMPARED IN THIS CASE A GRATIFICATION
7505-258958-0035 OF THE PRESENT MOMENT IS COMPARED WITH A GRATIFICATION OF A VERY DIFFERENT KIND AT A FUTURE TIME THE PROBLEM INVOLVED IS COMPLEX BECAUSE OF DIFFERENCES IN TIME IN PLACE AND IN THE NATURE OF THE WANT GRATIFIERS
7505-258964-0000 HE MULTIPLIES MANY OTHERS WE HAVE NOTED MANY KINDS OF DEPRECIATION DESTRUCTION AND WEARING OUT OF WEALTH BUT THE NORMAL THING IN A HEALTHY SOCIETY IS AN INCREASE ON THE WHOLE OF RENT BEARERS
7505-258964-0001 THE INCREASE OF RENTS IS DUE TO TWO CAUSES CHANGES IN THE AGENTS BY WHICH THEY BECOME MORE EFFICIENT TECHNICALLY OR MORE NUMEROUS AND CHANGES TAKING PLACE OUTSIDE OF THE AGENTS
7505-258964-0002 AFFECTING THE UTILITY OF THE PRODUCTS THE FIRST OF THESE WILL BE CONSIDERED IN THIS SECTION THE INCREASE OF THE EFFICIENCY OF AGENTS IS USUALLY THE AIM OF THE INDIVIDUAL PRODUCER
7505-258964-0003 AND THUS IS BROUGHT ABOUT AN INCREASE OF THE STOCK OF WEALTH IN SOME CASES HOWEVER IMPROVEMENTS SUCH AS THE DREDGING OF HARBORS OR AS THE PROTECTING OF FORESTS ARE MADE BY MEN COLLECTIVELY THROUGH THE AGENCY OF GOVERNMENTS
7505-258964-0004 SOMEWHERE HOWEVER THE DESIRE FOR THESE CHANGES MUST ARISE IN THE MINDS OF INDIVIDUALS INCREASE OF MOST THINGS INVOLVES COST OR SACRIFICE IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SENSE
7505-258964-0005 OTHER TRACTS LESS FERTILE OR FOR SOME REASON LESS AVAILABLE ARE DITCHED TILED AND DIKED AND FERTILIZERS ARE CARRIED UP STEEP HILLSIDES TO MAKE A SOIL UPON THE VERY CRAGS
7505-258964-0006 ENABLING THEM TO CARRY A GREATER AMOUNT OF FREIGHT WITHIN A YEAR
7505-258964-0007 THAT MAKE MACHINES STRONGER QUICKER AND BETTER THIS PROPOSITION IS NOT LOGICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE PRECEDING A MACHINE IS AN ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIAL THINGS
7505-258964-0008 THROUGH WHICH FORCE MAY BE INDIRECTLY APPLIED TO MOVE MATTER NO FAST LINE DIVIDES MACHINERY AS REGARDS FORM PURPOSE OR CAUSE OF VALUE FROM THE ARTIFICIALLY IMPROVED NATURAL AGENTS
7505-258964-0009 THAT WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING JUST AS A FIELD IS DRAINED PLOWED AND CULTIVATED TO FIT IT BETTER TO YIELD A CROP SO IS THE IRON ORE SHAPED INTO A FORM
7505-258964-0010 IF THE QUALITY OR EFFICIENCY OF LOOMS IS DOUBLED IT IS AS IF THEIR NUMBER HAD GROWN IN LIKE PROPORTION IN ITS ECONOMIC FUNCTION THE BEAST OF BURDEN MAY NOT ILLOGICALLY BE CLASSED WITH INANIMATE MACHINES
7505-258964-0011 AND THERE WAS MUCH COMMENT ON THIS EVIDENCE OF A DECLINING INDUSTRY IT WAS NOT AT ONCE RECOGNIZED THAT THERE WAS EMBODIED IN HORSE FLESH MORE HORSE POWER THAN EVER BEFORE
7505-258964-0012 SO AS TO MAKE A MORE EFFICIENT AGENT AND MACHINES IN TURN MAY BE ADJUSTED AS PARTS OF A LARGER SYSTEM OF PRODUCTION THE IDEAL OF THE MODERN FACTORY SYSTEM IS SO TO ARRANGE THE MACHINERY
7505-258964-0013 THAT NO BIT OF MATERIAL WILL MAKE AN UNNECESSARY MOTION THE LOG ONCE STARTED THROUGH THE MILL IS CARRIED AUTOMATICALLY FROM ONE MACHINE TO ANOTHER UNTIL IT EMERGES AS A ROLL OF PAPER
7505-258964-0014 OR AS A BOX OF TOOTH PICKS READY FOR USE IN AN AMERICAN WATCH FACTORY ONE MAN TENDS TWELVE OR FIFTEEN AUTOMATIC MACHINES A SMALL BRASS ROD IS FED AUTOMATICALLY TO THE MACHINE
7505-258964-0015 WHERE IT IS READY FOR THE ASSEMBLING OF THE WATCH AS THE MACHINERY IMPROVES FACTORIES MAKING ALLIED PRODUCTS ARE GROUPED TO MAKE A SYSTEM STILL MORE EFFICIENT AS THE NUMBER OF AGENTS INCREASES
7505-258964-0016 THEY ARE DISTRIBUTED SO AS TO BE WHERE MOST USEFUL TO THE OWNER A MAN HAVING TWO UMBRELLAS KEEPS ONE AT HIS OFFICE AND THE OTHER AT HOME A STUDENT HAVING TWO BOOKS OF THE SAME KIND
7505-258964-0017 WHICH CAPTURE THE NATURAL FORCES OF THE WORLD PUT THEM INTO THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME AND MAKE THEM DO THE RIGHT THING OR WHICH GROUP AND RELATE THE MATERIALS OF THE WORLD IN THE RIGHT WAYS
7505-258964-0018 SOME OF THE GROUPINGS IN THE CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL WORLD THAT DO NOT FIT MAN'S PURPOSES MAY BE MADE TO DO SO
7505-258964-0019 BUT IN DOING THAT HE AFFECTS THE AGENTS OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY OTHERS THE IDEAL FROM A SOCIAL STANDPOINT IS TO INCREASE NOT RENT BUT THE WELFARE OF SOCIETY
7505-258964-0020 AND THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE IDEAL OF INDIVIDUALS SEEKING THEIR OWN INTEREST HOWEVER AS THE EFFICIENCY OF SOME AGENTS RISES IT BECOMES UNNECESSARY AND UNPROFITABLE TO USE THE LESS FERTILE FIELDS
7505-258964-0021 THEY CEASE TO BE RENT BEARERS AND THE RENT OF THE RICHER FIELDS FALLS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE NEW SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS SOME INVENTIONS SUDDENLY INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF FREE GOODS TO SUCH A DEGREE
7505-258964-0022 THAT THE LESS EFFICIENT RENTED AGENTS ARE THROWN OUT OF USE AND THE MARGIN OF UTILIZATION IS MOVED TO A HIGHER PLANE THAN IT WAS ON BEFORE IMPROVED TYPES OF MACHINERY MORE OR LESS RAPIDLY DISPLACE THE OLDER
7505-258964-0023 LESS EFFICIENT TYPES WHICH THEREFORE MORE OR LESS COMPLETELY LOSE THEIR RENT BEARING POWER LONG BEFORE THEY ARE PHYSICALLY WORN OUT
7505-258964-0024 WHEN IMPROVEMENTS IN AGRICULTURE THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO A CONSIDERABLE AREA OF LAND TAKE PLACE AND THE PRODUCT THUS IS INCREASED AND CHEAPENED THE POORER LAND IS ABANDONED
7505-258964-0025 AGENTS OF THE SAME KIND MAY DIMINISH IN NUMBER EITHER ABSOLUTELY OR RELATIVELY
7505-258964-0026 SUCH A LUCKY FIND HAS LIFTED THE MORTGAGE FROM A FARM IN EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA FROM WHICH IN TWO OR THREE YEARS HAS BEEN TAKEN FELDSPAR EXCEEDING IN VALUE THE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS
7505-258964-0027 OF THE SAME LAND IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS THE DISCOVERY OF BUILDING STONE COAL NATURAL GAS OR OIL LAND MAY MAKE THE ANNUAL RENT OR ROYALTY
7505-258964-0028 OF LAND TENFOLD ITS FORMER TOTAL VALUE FITNESS TO PRODUCE NETTLES IS NOT ORDINARILY A VIRTUE IN LAND
7505-258964-0029 BUT THE DISCOVERY THAT CERTAIN FIELDS PRODUCE A SUPERIOR QUALITY OF THE NETTLE USED FOR HECKLING CLOTH CAUSES THEM TO TAKE ON A NEW VALUE A MINERAL SPRING BECAUSE OF THE
7505-258964-0030 MAY BE AS GOOD AS A MINE TO THE OWNER PECULIAR FITNESS FOR THE CULTIVATION OF CELERY MAY CONVERT MARSH LAND INTO A SUBSTANTIAL SOURCE OF INCOME
7505-258964-0031 SOCIAL CHANGES ARE CONSTANTLY CAUSING AGENTS TO SHIFT FROM LOWER TO HIGHER USES AS POPULATION GROWS AND GROUPS ABOUT NEW INDUSTRIES FARM LAND IS USED FOR RESIDENCE LOTS
7505-258964-0032 AND IN TURN FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES RENTS THEREFORE RISE AND THIS RISE IS REFLECTED IN THE HIGHER SELLING VALUE OF THE LAND IF A NEW DEMAND ARISES FOR THE PRODUCT OF ANY MACHINE
7505-258964-0033 ITS RENT RISES ALTHOUGH IT MAY CONTINUE TO TURN OUT THE SAME PRODUCT
7505-258964-0034 MAY BE RELATIVELY PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY BUSINESS CONDITIONS SOMETIMES CHANGE QUICKLY AN URGENT DEMAND FOR SPECIAL MACHINERY RAISES QUICKLY ITS RENT AND VALUE
7505-258964-0035 IT IS SAID THAT LACE MACHINERY IS SOMETIMES THROWN OUT OF USE FOR SEVERAL YEARS UNTIL A SUDDEN RENEWAL OF THE DEMAND FOR LACE CAUSES THE RENTAL TO EQUAL IN TWO YEARS
7505-258964-0036 MORE THAN THE ORIGINAL COST AT SUCH TIMES THE VALUE OF FACTORIES INCREASES GREATLY BUT AFTER A FEW YEARS OF PROSPERITY BUSINESS AGAIN COLLAPSES
7505-258964-0037 SUCH PROSPEROUS PERIODS ARE THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE BUSINESS MAN AND OF THE PROMOTER TO SELL THE FACTORY AT ITS HIGHEST PRICE MACHINERY ADAPTED ONLY FOR A SPECIAL PRODUCT
7505-258964-0038 WILL NOT SELL AS READILY WHEN LESS NEEDED FOR ITS SPECIAL USE AS THAT WHICH LIKE A TURNING LATHE CAN BE USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BUT THE MORE SPECIAL THE APPLIANCES NEEDED FOR A CERTAIN PRODUCT THE HIGHER
7505-258964-0039 MORE ABNORMAL WILL BE THEIR TEMPORARY VALUE WHEN THEY ARE SUDDENLY NEEDED LAND NEAR THE SITE OF AN EXPOSITION TAKES ON A VERY
7505-258964-0040 PUTS A CHECK OR SETS A LIMIT TO THE RISE IN THIS SEARCH FOR NEW DEVICES THE MAN WHO CAN SEE MOST QUICKLY AND CLEARLY HAS A KEY TO WEALTH
7505-258964-0041 SOME KINDS OF AGENTS AS RARE MINERALS OR TOOLS THAT CAN BE PRODUCED ONLY BY HIGHLY SKILLED LABOR CANNOT BE INCREASED RAPIDLY IN NUMBER AND REMAIN HIGH IN PRICE FOR A LONG PERIOD
7505-258964-0042 AND FAVORABLY LOCATED BUILDING SITES ILLUSTRATE THE SAME PRINCIPLE IN SOME CASES IT IS TRUE THE DEMAND MAY BE DUE TO SOME TEMPORARY CAUSE
7505-258964-0043 WATERWORKS GAS WORKS STREET RAILWAYS FERRIES AND WHARVES THIS EVIDENTLY IS ONLY A SPECIAL ILLUSTRATION OF THE PRINCIPLE JUST STATED WHERE IT IS NOT EASY TO FIND A SUBSTITUTE FOR CERTAIN AGENTS
7505-258964-0044 PUBLIC FRANCHISES ENTITLE THE OWNERS TO SPECIAL SOMETIMES EXCLUSIVE PRIVILEGES AND PROTECT THEM LEGALLY FROM COMPETITION NOT ALL FRANCHISES ARE VALUABLE
7505-258964-0045 MANY STREET RAILWAYS ARE UNFORTUNATE VENTURES THE EARNINGS BEING INSUFFICIENT TO PAY EXPENSES TO SAY NOTHING OF INTEREST ON THE INVESTMENT BUT WHEN THEY PAY GREATLY
7505-258964-0046 THEIR HIGH VALUE IS DUE TO THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF COMPETITION THE CARS MULES DYNAMOS STEAM ENGINES
7505-258964-0047 DUE TO ACCIDENTAL AND SOCIAL CAUSES RAISING THE RENTS OF WEALTH THE TERM UNEARNED INCREMENT MAY BE DEFINED AS AN INCREASE IN RENTS OR VALUE OF AGENTS
7505-258964-0048 DUE TO SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE EFFORTS OR MERITS OF THE OWNER IN FACT IT IS THAT OF WHICH WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING IN SOME CASES POWERFUL OR WEALTHY MEN
7505-258964-0049 CAN BRING ABOUT SOCIAL CHANGES IN ENTIRELY LEGITIMATE WAYS THE OWNER OF A LARGE FACTORY MOVING IT INTO THE COUNTRY MAY BUY UP SURROUNDING LAND AND FOUND A CITY CONVERTING PASTURE LANDS AND CORN FIELDS
7505-258964-0050 IS POWERLESS TO AFFECT THE RESULT HE CAN ONLY ADAPT HIS CONDUCT IN SOME MEASURE SO AS TO REAP AN ADVANTAGE HE CAN STRIVE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER AND QUALITY
7505-258964-0051 AS WELL AS OF GAIN THE TERM UNEARNED INCREMENT HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY USED IN RECENT YEARS
7505-83618-0000 THEIR CULTURE MYTH WHICH HE HAS RECORDED
7505-83618-0001 THE BLOOD GUSHED FROM HIM AT EVERY STEP AND AS IT FELL TURNED INTO FLINT STONES THE VICTOR RETURNED TO HIS GRANDMOTHER AND ESTABLISHED HIS LODGE IN THE FAR EAST ON THE BORDERS OF THE GREAT OCEAN WHENCE THE SUN COMES IN TIME HE BECAME THE FATHER OF MANKIND
7505-83618-0002 OF THE EARLY NATIVE TRADITIONS SO STRONG IS THE RESEMBLANCE IOSKEHA BEARS TO MICHABO THAT WHAT HAS BEEN SAID IN EXPLANATION OF THE LATTER WILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR BOTH
7505-83618-0003 YET I DO NOT IMAGINE THAT THE ONE WAS COPIED OR BORROWED FROM THE OTHER WE CANNOT BE TOO CAUTIOUS IN ADOPTING SUCH A CONCLUSION THE TWO NATIONS WERE REMOTE IN EVERYTHING BUT GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION
7505-83618-0004 I CALL TO MIND ANOTHER SIMILAR MYTH IN IT A MOTHER IS ALSO SAID TO HAVE BROUGHT FORTH TWINS OR A PAIR OF TWINS AND TO HAVE PAID FOR THEM WITH HER LIFE AGAIN THE ONE IS DESCRIBED AS THE BRIGHT
7505-83618-0005 SCHOLARS LIKEWISE HAVE INTERPRETED THE MOTHER TO MEAN THE DAWN THE TWINS EITHER LIGHT AND DARKNESS OR THE FOUR WINDS YET THIS IS NOT ALGONKIN THEOLOGY NOR IS IT AT ALL RELATED TO THAT OF THE IROQUOIS
7505-83618-0006 IT IS THE STORY OF SARAMA IN THE RIG VEDA AND WAS WRITTEN IN SANSCRIT UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE HIMALAYAS CENTURIES BEFORE HOMER SUCH UNIFORMITY POINTS NOT TO A COMMON SOURCE IN HISTORY
7505-83618-0007 BUT IN PSYCHOLOGY MAN CHIEFLY COGNIZANT OF HIS SOUL THROUGH HIS SENSES THOUGHT WITH AN AWFUL HORROR OF THE NIGHT WHICH DEPRIVED HIM OF THE USE OF ONE AND FORESHADOWED THE LOSS OF ALL THEREFORE
7505-83618-0008 LIGHT AND LIFE WERE TO HIM SYNONYMOUS THEREFORE ALL RELIGIONS PROMISE TO LEAD FROM NIGHT TO LIGHT FROM NIGHT TO HEAVENLY LIGHT THEREFORE HE WHO RESCUES IS EVER THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD
7505-83618-0009 A MESSIAH FAIRER THAN THE CHILDREN OF MEN FULFILLED IN THAT DAY WHEN HE APPEARED IN GARMENTS SO WHITE AS NO FULLER ON EARTH COULD WHITE THEM
7505-83618-0010 LANGUAGE ITSELF IS PROOF OF IT MANY ALGONKIN WORDS FOR EAST MORNING DAWN DAY LIGHT
7505-83618-0011 ARE DERIVED FROM A RADICAL SIGNIFYING WHITE
7505-83618-0012 BUT PACHACAMA ATTACKED AND DROVE HIM TO THE NORTH IRRITATED AT HIS DEFEAT HE TOOK WITH HIM THE RAIN AND CONSEQUENTLY TO THIS DAY THE SEA COAST OF PERU IS LARGELY AN ARID DESERT NOW WHEN WE ARE INFORMED THAT THE SOUTH WIND
7505-83618-0013 FOR ASKED THE INCAS
7505-83618-0014 FOR HE WAS ATTACKED WITH MURDEROUS INTENT BY THE BEINGS WHOM HE HAD CREATED WHEN HOWEVER SCORNING SUCH UNEQUAL COMBAT HE HAD MANIFESTED HIS POWER BY HURLING THE LIGHTNING ON THE HILL SIDES AND CONSUMING THE FORESTS
7505-83618-0015 THEY RECOGNIZED THEIR MAKER AND HUMBLED THEMSELVES BEFORE HIM HE WAS RECONCILED AND TAUGHT THEM ARTS AND AGRICULTURE INSTITUTIONS AND RELIGION MERITING THE TITLE THEY GAVE HIM OF PACHAYACHACHIC
7505-83618-0016 TEACHER OF ALL THINGS AT LAST HE DISAPPEARED IN THE WESTERN OCEAN FOUR PERSONAGES COMPANIONS OR SONS WERE CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH HIM
7505-83618-0017 TO A THIRD THE EAST TO A FOURTH THE WEST
7505-83618-0018 AND THAT OF MICHABO BOTH PRECEDE AND CREATE THE SUN BOTH JOURNEY TO THE WEST OVERCOMING OPPOSITION WITH THE THUNDERBOLT BOTH DIVIDE THE WORLD BETWEEN THE FOUR WINDS BOTH WERE THE FATHERS GODS AND TEACHERS OF THEIR NATIONS
7505-83618-0019 NOR DOES IT CEASE HERE MICHABO I HAVE SHOWN IS THE WHITE SPIRIT OF THE DAWN VIRACOCHA ALL AUTHORITIES TRANSLATE
7505-83618-0020 FOR HIS HIGH PRIEST ALWAYS BORE HIS NAME BUT HE HIMSELF IS A PURE CREATION OF THE FANCY AND ALL HIS ALLEGED HISTORY IS NOTHING BUT A MYTH HIS EMBLEMATIC NAME THE BIRD SERPENT AND HIS REBUS AND CROSS AT
7505-83618-0021 I HAVE ALREADY EXPLAINED OTHERS OF HIS TITLES WERE
7505-83618-0022 YOLCUAT THE RATTLESNAKE TOHIL THE RUMBLER HUEMAC THE STRONG HAND
7505-83618-0023 THE SAME DUALISM REAPPEARS IN HIM THAT HAS BEEN NOTED IN HIS ANALOGUES ELSEWHERE HE IS BOTH LORD OF THE EASTERN LIGHT AND THE WINDS AS THE FORMER HE WAS BORN OF A VIRGIN IN THE LAND OF TULA OR TLAPALLAN IN THE DISTANT ORIENT
7505-83618-0024 HE WAS FIGURATIVELY SAID TO SWEEP THE ROAD FOR HIM SINCE IN THAT COUNTRY VIOLENT WINDS ARE THE PRECURSORS OF THE WET SEASONS WHEREVER HE WENT ALL MANNER OF SINGING BIRDS BORE HIM COMPANY EMBLEMS OF THE WHISTLING BREEZES
7505-83618-0025 THE HILL OF SHOUTING WITH SUCH A MIGHTY VOICE THAT IT COULD BE HEARD A HUNDRED LEAGUES AROUND THE ARROWS WHICH HE SHOT TRANSFIXED GREAT TREES THE STONES HE THREW LEVELLED FORESTS
7505-83618-0026 AND WHEN HE LAID HIS HANDS ON THE ROCKS THE MARK WAS INDELIBLE YET AS THUS EMBLEMATIC OF THE THUNDER STORM HE POSSESSED IN FULL MEASURE

7511-102419-0003 THE SKY WAS CLEAR BLUE
7511-102419-0004 THE MOUNTAINS ON ONE SIDE WERE CRESTED GREAT CRAGS AND PILES OF ROCK CROWNED THEM AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE TIMBER GREW ONLY ABOUT HALFWAY UP THE TRUNKS OF THE QUAKING ASPENS SHONE SILVERY IN THE EARLY SUNLIGHT AND THEIR LEAVES WERE SHIMMERING GOLD
7511-102419-0005 AND THE STATELY PINES KEPT WHISPERING AND MURMURING IT ALMOST SEEMED AS IF THEY WERE CHIDING THE QUAKING ASPENS FOR BEING FRIVOLOUS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD LAY THE RIVER BORDERED BY WILLOWS AND GRASSY FLATS
7511-102419-0006 THERE WERE MANY SMALL LAKES AND THE DUCKS AND GEESE WERE NOISILY ENJOYING THEMSELVES AMONG THE RUSHES AND WATER GRASSES BEYOND THE RIVER ROSE THE FOREST COVERED MOUNTAINS HILL UPON HILL ELIZABETH DRESSED WITH ESPECIAL CARE THAT MORNING
7511-102419-0007 AND VERY PRETTY SHE LOOKED IN HER NEAT SHEPHERD'S PLAID SUIT AND NATTY LITTLE WHITE CANVAS HAT VERY SOON SHE SAID I HOPE NEITHER OF YOU WILL MISUNDERSTAND ME WHEN I TELL YOU THAT IF MY HOPES ARE REALIZED I WILL NOT RIDE WITH YOU MUCH LONGER

7511-102419-0009 AND I NEVER SAW SUCH PEOPLE YOU ARE JUST LIKE YOUR COUNTRY YOU HAVE FED ME CARED FOR ME AND BEFRIENDED ME A STRANGER

7511-102419-0012 BEFORE I WAS THROUGH SCHOOL I WAS TO HAVE BEEN MARRIED BUT I LOST MY MOTHER JUST THEN AND WAS LEFT THE CARE OF MY PARALYTIC FATHER IF I HAD MARRIED THEN I SHOULD HAVE HAD TO TAKE FATHER FROM HIS FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS BECAUSE WALLACE CAME WEST IN THE FORESTRY SERVICE
7511-102419-0013 I FELT THAT IT WOULDN'T BE RIGHT POOR FATHER COULDN'T SPEAK BUT HIS EYES TOLD ME HOW GRATEFUL HE WAS TO STAY WE HAD OUR LITTLE HOME AND FATHER HAD HIS PENSION AND I WAS ABLE TO GET A SMALL SCHOOL NEAR US
7511-102419-0014 I COULD TAKE CARE OF FATHER AND TEACH ALSO WE WERE VERY COMFORTABLY SITUATED AND IN TIME BECAME REALLY HAPPY ALTHOUGH I SELDOM HEARD FROM WALLACE HIS LETTERS WERE WELL WORTH WAITING FOR AND I KNEW HE WAS DOING WELL
7511-102419-0015 EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO FATHER DIED GENTLY WENT TO SLEEP I WAITED SIX MONTHS AND THEN WROTE TO WALLACE BUT RECEIVED NO REPLY
7511-102419-0016 I COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER AND HAVE COME TO SEE WHAT HAS BECOME OF HIM IF HE IS DEAD MAY I STAY ON WITH ONE OF YOU AND PERHAPS GET A SCHOOL I WANT TO LIVE HERE ALWAYS BUT DARLINT SAID MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY
7511-102419-0017 SUPPOSIN IT'S MARRIED YOUR MAN IS WALLACE MAY HAVE CHANGED HIS MIND ABOUT ME BUT HE WOULD NOT MARRY WITHOUT TELLING ME IF HE IS ALIVE HE IS HONORABLE THEN I ASKED
7511-102419-0018 IF HE IS STATIONED IN THE BRIDGES RESERVE THEY WOULD BE SURE TO KNOW OF HIM AT ANY OF THESE LITTLE PLACES I JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO I SHOULD NEVER HAVE TOLD YOU WHAT I HAVE ONLY I THINK I OWE IT TO YOU AND IT WAS EASIER BECAUSE OF THE HOLTS
7511-102419-0019 I AM SO GLAD WE MET THEM SO WE DROVE ALONG TALKING TOGETHER WE EACH ASSURED THE GIRL OF OUR ENTIRE WILLINGNESS TO HAVE HER AS A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY AFTER A WHILE I GOT ON TO THE WAGON WITH MISTER STEWART AND TOLD HIM ELIZABETH'S STORY
7511-102419-0020 AND WE HELD OUR BREATH UNTIL WE EMERGED ON THE OTHER SIDE MISTER SORENSON IS A VERY CAPABLE AND CONSCIENTIOUS GAME WARDEN AND A VERY GENIAL GENTLEMAN HE RODE DOWN TO MEET US
7511-102419-0021 TO INSPECT OUR LICENSE AND TO TELL US ABOUT OUR PRIVILEGES AND OUR DUTIES AS GOOD WOODSMEN HE ALSO ISSUES LICENSES IN CASE HUNTERS HAVE NEGLECTED TO SECURE THEM BEFORE COMING MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY HAD REFUSED TO GET A LICENSE WHEN WE DID
7511-102419-0022 SHE SAID SHE WAS NOT GOING TO HUNT SHE TOLD US WE COULD GIVE HER A SMALL PIECE OF ILK AND THAT WOULD DO SO WE WERE RATHER SURPRISED WHEN SHE PURCHASED TWO LICENSES ONE A SPECIAL WHICH WOULD ENTITLE HER TO A BULL ELK
7511-102419-0023 AS WE WERE STARTING MISTER STEWART ASKED THE GAME WARDEN CAN YOU TELL ME IF WALLACE WHITE IS STILL STATIONED HERE OH YES MISTER SORENSON SAID WALLACE'S PLACE IS ONLY A FEW MILES UP THE RIVER AND CAN BE PLAINLY SEEN FROM THE ROAD WE DROVE ON
7511-102419-0024 HAPPINESS HAD TAKEN A NEW CLUTCH UPON MY HEART I LOOKED BACK EXPECTING TO SEE ELIZABETH ALL SMILES BUT IF YOU WILL BELIEVE ME THE FOOLISH GIRL WAS SOBBING AS IF HER HEART WAS BROKEN MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY DREW HER HEAD DOWN UPON HER SHOULDER
7511-102419-0025 AND WAS TRYING TO QUIET HER THE ROAD ALONG THERE WAS VERY ROUGH STAYING ON THE WAGON OCCUPIED ALL MY ATTENTION FOR A WHILE SEVERAL MILES WERE PASSED WHEN WE CAME IN SIGHT OF A BEAUTIFUL CABIN HALF HIDDEN IN A GROVE OF PINES BEYOND THE RIVER
7511-102419-0026 MISTER STEWART SAID WE MIGHT AS WELL NOON AS SOON AS WE CAME TO A GOOD PLACE AND THEN HE WOULD RIDE ACROSS AND SEE MISTER WHITE JUST AS WE ROUNDED THE HILL A HORSEMAN CAME TOWARD US A SPLENDID FELLOW HE WAS
7511-102419-0027 MANLY STRENGTH AND GRACE SHOWING IN EVERY LINE THE ROAD WAS NARROW AGAINST THE HILLSIDE AND HE HAD TO RIDE QUITE CLOSE SO I SAW HIS HANDSOME FACE PLAINLY AS SOON AS HE SAW ELIZABETH HE SPRANG FROM HIS SADDLE AND SAID LIZ'BETH LIZ'BETH
7511-102419-0028 SHE HELD HER HANDS TO HIM AND SAID OH JUST RIDING WITH FRIENDS THEN TO MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY SHE SAID THIS IS MY WALLACE MISTER STEWART IS THE QUEEREST MAN
7511-102419-0029 INSTEAD OF LETTING ME ENJOY THE TABLEAU HE SOLEMNLY DROVE ON SAYING HE WOULD NOT WANT ANY ONE GAWKING AT HIM IF HE WERE THE HAPPY MAN ANYWAY HE COULDN'T URGE CHUB FAST ENOUGH TO PREVENT MY SEEING AND HEARING WHAT I'VE TOLD YOU
7511-102419-0030 BESIDES THAT I SAW THAT ELIZABETH'S HAT WAS ON AWRY HER HAIR IN DISORDER AND HER EYES RED IT WAS DISAPPOINTING AFTER SHE HAD BEEN SO CAREFUL TO LOOK NICELY MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY CAME TROTTING ALONG AND WE STOPPED FOR DINNER
7511-102419-0031 WE HAD JUST GOT THE COFFEE BOILING WHEN THE LOVERS CAME UP ELIZABETH IN THE SADDLE LEARNING TO RIDE AND HE WALKING BESIDE HER HOLDING HER HAND HOW HAPPY THEY WERE THE REST OF US WERE MIGHTY NEAR AS FOOLISH AS THEY
7511-102419-0032 THEY WERE GOING TO START IMMEDIATELY AFTER DINNER ON HORSEBACK FOR THE COUNTY SEAT TO BE MARRIED AFTER WE HAD EATEN ELIZABETH SELECTED A FEW THINGS FROM HER TRUNK AND MISTER STEWART AND MISTER WHITE DROVE THE BUCKBOARD ACROSS THE RIVER TO LEAVE THE TRUNK IN ITS NEW HOME
7511-102419-0033 WHILE THEY WERE GONE WE HELPED ELIZABETH TO DRESS ALL THE WHILE MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY WAS ADMONISHING HER TO NAME HER FIRST GIRUL MARY ELLEN OR SHE SAID
7511-102419-0034 WHICH WAS ME NAME BEFORE I WAS MARRIED TO ME MAN GOD REST HIS SOUL DEAR ELIZABETH SHE WAS GLAD TO GET AWAY I SUSPECT SHE AND HER WALLACE MADE A FINE COUPLE AS THEY RODE AWAY IN THE GOLDEN SEPTEMBER AFTERNOON
7511-102419-0035 I BELIEVE SHE IS ONE HAPPY BRIDE THAT THE SUN SHONE ON IF THE OMEN HAS FAILED EVERYWHERE ELSE WELL WE FELT POWERFULLY REDUCED IN NUMBERS BUT ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK THAT AFTERNOON WE CAME UPON MISTER STRUBLE AND MISTER HAYNES
7511-102419-0036 WAITING BESIDE THE ROAD FOR US THEY HAD COME TO PILOT US INTO CAMP FOR THERE WOULD BE NO ROAD SOON SUCH A WAY AS WE CAME OVER SUCH JOLTING AND SLIDING I BEGGED TO GET OFF AND WALK
7511-102419-0037 BUT AS THE WHOLE WAY WAS CARPETED BY STRAWBERRY VINES AND THERE WERE LATE BERRIES TO TEMPT ME TO LOITER I HAD TO STAY ON THE WAGON I HAD NO IDEA A WAGON COULD BE GOT ACROSS SUCH PLACES MISTER STRUBLE DROVE FOR MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY
7511-102419-0038 AND I COULD HEAR HER IMPLORING ALL THE SAINTS TO PRESERVE US FROM INSTANT DEATH I KEPT SHUTTING MY EYES TRYING NOT TO SEE THE TERRIFYING PLACES AND OPENING THEM AGAIN TO SEE THE BEAUTY SPREAD EVERYWHERE UNTIL MISTER STEWART SAID
7511-102419-0039 IT MUST MAKE YOU NERVOUS TO RIDE OVER MOUNTAIN ROADS DON'T BAT YOUR EYES SO FAST AND YOU'LL SEE MORE SO THEN I STIFFENED MY BACK AND KEPT MY EYES OPEN AND I DID SEE MORE IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO GO AS FAR AS WE COULD WITH THE WAGONS AND THEN SET CAMP
7511-102419-0040 FROM THERE THE HUNTERS WOULD RIDE HORSEBACK AS FAR UP AS THEY COULD AND THEN CLIMB IT WAS ALMOST SUNDOWN WHEN WE REACHED CAMP ALL THE HUNTERS WERE IN AND SUCH A YOWLING AS THEY SET UP
7511-102419-0041 LOOK WHO'S HERE SEE WHO'S COME THEY YELLED THEY WENT TO WORK SETTING UP TENTS AND UNLOADING WAGONS WITH A HEARTY GOOD WILL WE ARE CAMPED JUST ON THE EDGE OF THE PINES BACK OF US RISES A BIG PINE CLAD MOUNTAIN
7511-102419-0042 OUR TENTS ARE SET UNDER SOME BIG TREES ON A SMALL PLATEAU AND RIGHT BELOW US IS A VALLEY IN WHICH GRASS GROWS KNEE HIGH AND LITTLE STREAMS COME FROM EVERY WAY TROUT SCURRY UP STREAM WHENEVER WE GO NEAR
7511-102419-0043 WE CALL THE VALLEY PARADISE VALLEY BECAUSE IT IS THE HORSES PARADISE AND AS IN THE EARLY MORNING WE CAN OFTEN SEE CLOUDS ROLLING ALONG THE VALLEY WE CALL OUR CAMP CLOUDCREST WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL PLACE IT IS WELL SHELTERED
7511-102419-0044 THERE IS PLENTY OF WOOD WATER AND FEED AND LOOKING EASTWARD DOWN THE VALLEY SNOW COVERED CRAG TOPPED MOUNTAINS DELIGHT THE EYE THE AIR IS SO BRACING THAT WE ALL FEEL EQUAL TO ANYTHING
7511-102419-0045 MISTER STRUBLE HAS ALREADY KILLED A FINE SPIKE ELK FOR CAMP EATING WE CAMPED IN A BUNCH AND WE HAVE CAMP STOVES SO THAT IN CASE OF RAIN OR SNOW WE CAN STAY INDOORS JUST NOW WE HAVE A HUGE CAMP FIRE
7511-102419-0046 AROUND WHICH WE SIT IN THE EVENING TELLING STORIES SINGING AND EATING NUTS OF THE PINON PINE THEN TOO THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS FILLED WITH THOSE TINY LITTLE STRAWBERRIES WE HAVE TO GATHER ALL DAY TO GET AS MUCH AS WE CAN EAT
7511-102419-0047 BUT THEY ARE DELICIOUS YESTERDAY WE HAD PIE MADE OF WILD CURRANTS THERE ARE A POWERFUL LOT OF THEM HERE THERE IS ALSO A LITTLE BLUEBERRY THAT THE MEN SAY IS THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN HUCKLEBERRY THE GROUSE ARE FEEDING ON THEM
7511-102419-0048 ALTOGETHER THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL PLACES IMAGINABLE THE MEN ARE NOT VERY ANXIOUS TO BEGIN HUNTING A LITTLE DELAY MEANS COOLER WEATHER FOR THE MEAT IT IS COOL UP HERE BUT GOING BACK ACROSS THE DESERT IT WILL BE WARM FOR A WHILE YET STILL
7511-102419-0049 WHEN THEY SEE ELK EVERY DAY IT IS A GREAT TEMPTATION TO TRY A SHOT ONE OF THE STUDENTS TOLD ME PROFESSOR GLENHOLDT WAS HERE TO GET THE TIP END BONE OF THE TAIL OF A BRONTOSAURUS
7511-102419-0050 AS HE HAD HEARD THEY WERE FINE EATING HAVING STRATA OF FAT ALTERNATING WITH STRATA OF LEAN MISTER HAYNES IS A QUIET FELLOW JUST INTERESTED IN HUNTING MISTER STRUBLE IS THE BIG MAN OF THE PARTY
7511-102419-0051 HE IS TALL AND STRONG AND WE FIND HIM VERY PLEASANT COMPANY THEN THERE IS DOCTOR TESCHALL HE IS A QUIET FELLOW WITH AN UNEXPECTED SMILE HE IS SO RESERVED THAT I FELT THAT HE WAS KIND OF OUT OF PLACE AMONG THE REST UNTIL I CAUGHT HIS CORDIAL SMILE
7511-102419-0052 NOT TO MENTION CARRYING THE HEAVY GUN THEY ARE USING THE LARGEST CALIBER SPORTING GUNS MURDEROUS LOOKING THINGS THAT IS ALL EXCEPT MISTER HARKRUDDER THE PICTURE MAN
7511-102419-0053 HE LOOKS TO BE ABOUT FORTY YEARS OLD BUT WHOOPS AND LAUGHS LIKE HE WAS ABOUT TEN I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU OF THE GOOD MON DO I HE IS JUST THE KIND QUIET GOOD MON THAT HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SINCE I HAVE KNOWN HIM
7511-102419-0054 HE TOLD MISTER HAYNES HE WAS TOO TAM SEEK IN DE BEL SO WE HAD TO COME WITHOUT HIM
7511-102419-0055 AND ARE ALL WILLING TO HELP I DON'T THINK I SHALL BE ABLE TO TELL YOU OF ANY GREAT EXPLOITS I MAKE WITH THE GUN I FIRED ONE THAT MISTER STEWART CARRIES AND IT ALMOST KICKED MY SHOULDER OFF I AM MYSTIFIED ABOUT MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY'S LICENSE
7511-102419-0056 I KNOW SHE WOULD NOT SHOOT ONE OF THOSE BIG GUNS FOR A DOZEN ELK BESIDES THAT SHE IS VERY TENDER HEARTED AND WILL NEVER HARM ANYTHING HERSELF ALTHOUGH SHE LIKES TO JOIN OUR HUNTS I THINK YOU MUST BE TIRED OF THIS LETTER SO I AM GOING TO SAY GOOD NIGHT MY FRIEND
7511-102420-0000 CAMP CLOUDCREST OCTOBER SIXTH NINETEEN FOURTEEN DEAR MISSUS CONEY IT SEEMS SO ODD TO BE WRITING YOU AND GETTING NO ANSWERS
7511-102420-0001 I HAVEN'T ONE THING I TOLD HER I OWED YOU MORE LOVE THAN I COULD EVER PAY IN A LIFETIME AND SHE SAID WRITING SUCH LONG LETTERS IS A MIGHTY POOR WAY TO SHOW IT I HAVE BEEN NEGLECTING YOU SHAMEFULLY I THINK
7511-102420-0002 ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I CAME ON THIS HUNT WAS TO TAKE THE TRIP FOR YOU AND TO TELL YOU THINGS THAT YOU WOULD MOST ENJOY SO I WILL SPEND THIS SNOWY DAY IN WRITING TO YOU ON THE NIGHT OF SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH THERE WAS THE MOST AWFUL THUNDERSTORM I EVER WITNESSED
7511-102420-0003 FLASH AFTER FLASH OF THE MOST BLINDING LIGHTNING FOLLOWED BY DEAFENING PEALS OF THUNDER AND AS IT ECHOED FROM MOUNTAIN TO MOUNTAIN THE UPROAR WAS TERRIFYING I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED A STORM THE BEAT OF HAIL AND RAIN AND THE ROAR OF WIND
7511-102420-0004 ALWAYS APPEAL TO ME BUT THERE WAS NEITHER WIND NOR RAIN JUST FLASH AND ROAR BEFORE THE ECHO DIED AWAY AMONG THE HILLS ANOTHER BOOMING REPORT WOULD SEEM TO SHIVER THE ATMOSPHERE AND SET ALL OUR TINWARE JANGLING
7511-102420-0005 WE ARE CAMPED SO NEAR THE GREAT PINES THAT I WILL CONFESS I WAS POWERFULLY AFRAID HAD THE LIGHTNING STRUCK ONE OF THE BIG PINES THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ONE OF US LEFT I COULD HEAR MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY MURMURING HER PRAYERS WHEN THERE WAS A LULL
7511-102420-0006 WE HAD GONE TO BED BUT I COULDN'T REMAIN THERE SO I SAT ON THE WAGON SEAT WITH JERRINE BESIDE ME SOMETHING STRUCK THE GUY ROPES OF THE TENT AND I WAS SO FRIGHTENED I WAS TOO WEAK TO CRY OUT I THOUGHT THE BIG TREE MUST HAVE FALLEN
7511-102420-0007 IN THE LULLS OF THE STORM I COULD HEAR THE MEN'S VOICES HIGH AND EXCITED THEY TOO WERE UP IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE STORM LASTED FOR HOURS BUT AT LAST IT MOVED OFF UP THE VALLEY THE FLASHES GREW TO BE A MERE GLIMMER
7511-102420-0008 AND THE THUNDER MERE RUMBLING THE PINES BEGAN TO MOAN AND SOON A LITTLE BREEZE WHISTLED BY SO WE LAY DOWN AGAIN NEXT MORNING THE HORSES COULD NOT BE FOUND THE STORM HAD FRIGHTENED THEM AND THEY HAD TRIED TO GO HOME
7511-102420-0009 THE MEN HAD TO FIND THEM AND AS IT TOOK MOST OF THE DAY WE HAD TO PUT OFF OUR HUNT WE WERE UP AND ABOUT NEXT MORNING IN THE FIRST FAINT GRAY LIGHT WHILE THE MEN FED GRAIN TO THE HORSES AND SADDLED THEM WE PREPARED A HASTY BREAKFAST
7511-102420-0010 WE WERE OFF BEFORE IT WAS MORE THAN LIGHT ENOUGH FOR US TO SEE THE TRAIL DAWN IN THE MOUNTAINS HOW I WISH I COULD DESCRIBE IT TO YOU IF I COULD ONLY MAKE YOU FEEL THE KEEN BRACING AIR THE EXHILARATING CLIMB
7511-102420-0011 GREENISH AMBER LIGHT AND A BLUE GRAY SKY FAR AHEAD OF US WE COULD SEE THE RED RIM ROCK OF A MOUNTAIN ABOVE TIMBER LINE THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN TURNED THE JAGGED PEAKS INTO GOLDEN POINTS OF A CROWN IN OKLAHOMA
7511-102420-0012 EVEN AT THIS SEASON BUT HERE THERE ARE NO SONG BIRDS AND ONLY THE SNAPPING OF TWIGS AS OUR HORSES CLIMBED THE FROSTY TRAIL BROKE THE SILENCE WE HAD BEEN CAUTIONED NOT TO TALK BUT NEITHER MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY NOR I WANTED TO
7511-102420-0013 THE SUN WAS WELL UP WHEN WE REACHED THE LITTLE PARK WHERE WE PICKETED OUR HORSES THEN CAME A LONG HARD CLIMB IT IS HARD CLIMBING AT THE BEST AND WHEN THERE IS A BIG GUN TO CARRY IT IS VERY HARD
7511-102420-0014 THEN TOO WE HAD TO KEEP UP WITH THE MEN AND WE DIDN'T FIND THAT EASY TO DO AT LAST WE REACHED THE TOP AND SAT DOWN ON SOME BOULDERS TO REST A FEW MINUTES BEFORE WE STARTED DOWN TO THE HUNTING GROUND WHICH LAY IN A CUPLIKE VALLEY FAR BELOW US
7511-102420-0015 WE COULD HEAR THE ROAR OF THE GROS VENTRE AS IT TUMBLED GRUMBLINGLY OVER ITS ROCKY BED TO OUR RIGHT ROSE MILE AFTER MILE OF RED CLIFFS AS THE LAST OF THE QUAKING ASP LEAVES HAVE FALLEN THERE WERE NO GOLDEN GROVES
7511-102420-0016 IN THEIR PLACES STOOD SILVERY PATCHES AGAINST THE RED BACKGROUND OF THE CLIFFS HIGH OVERHEAD A TRIANGLE OF WILD GEESE HARROWED THE BLUE SKY I WAS PLUMB OUT OF BREATH BUT MEN WHO ARE MOST GALLANT ELSEWHERE ARE
7511-102420-0017 ABSOLUTELY HEARTLESS ON A HUNT I WAS SCARCELY THROUGH PANTING BEFORE WE BEGAN TO DESCEND WE RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS AS TO HOW WE SHOULD MOVE SO AS TO KEEP OUT OF RANGE OF EACH OTHER'S GUNS THEN MISTER HAYNES AND MYSELF STARTED ONE WAY
7511-102420-0018 AND MISTER STRUBLE AND MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY THE OTHER WE WERE TO MEET WHERE THE VALLEY TERMINATED IN A BROAD PASS WE FELT SURE WE COULD GET A CHANCE AT WHAT ELK THERE MIGHT BE IN THE VALLEY WE WERE FOLLOWING FRESH TRACKS AND A LITTLE OF THE HUNTER'S ENTHUSIASM SEIZED ME
7511-102420-0019 WE HAD NOT FOLLOWED THEM FAR WHEN THREE COWS AND A SPIKE CAME RUNNING OUT OF THE PINES A LITTLE AHEAD OF US INSTANTLY MISTER HAYNES'S GUN FLEW TO HIS SHOULDER AND A DEAFENING REPORT JARRED OUR EARS HE RAN FORWARD
7511-102420-0020 BUT I STOOD STILL FASCINATED BY WHAT I SAW OUR SIDE OF THE VALLEY WAS BOUNDED BY A RIM OF ROCK OVER THE RIM WAS A SHEER WALL OF ROCK FOR TWO HUNDRED FEET TO WHERE THE GROS VENTRE WAS ANGRILY ROARING BELOW ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREAM
7511-102420-0021 ROSE THE RED CLIFFS WITH THEIR JAGGED CRAGS AT THE REPORT OF THE GUN TWO HUGE BLOCKS OF STONE ALMOST AS LARGE AS A HOUSE DETACHED THEMSELVES AND FELL AT THE SAME INSTANT ONE OF THE QUAKING ASP GROVES
7511-102420-0022 BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES I SHUT THEM A MOMENT BUT WHEN I LOOKED THE GROVE WAS MOVING FASTER IT SLID SWIFTLY AND I COULD PLAINLY HEAR THE RATTLE OF STONES FALLING AGAINST STONES UNTIL WITH A MUFFLED ROAR
7511-102420-0023 THE WHOLE HILLSIDE FELL INTO THE STREAM MISTER HAYNES CAME RUNNING BACK WHAT IS THE MATTER ARE YOU HURT WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOOT HE ASKED I WAVED MY HAND WEAKLY TOWARD WHERE THE GREAT MOUND OF TANGLED TREES AND EARTH BLOCKED THE WATER
7511-102420-0024 NOT AN EARTHQUAKE YOU ARE AS WHITE AS A GHOST COME ON UP HERE AND SEE MY FINE ELK I SAT ON A LOG WATCHING HIM DRESS HIS ELK WE HAVE FOUND IT BEST NOT TO REMOVE THE SKIN
7511-102420-0025 BUT THE ELK HAVE TO BE QUARTERED SO AS TO LOAD THEM ON TO A HORSE MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY AND MISTER STRUBLE CAME OUT OF THE WOODS JUST THEN THEY HAD SEEN A BIG BUNCH OF ELK HEADED BY A SPLENDID BULL BUT GOT NO SHOT AND THE ELK WENT OUT OF THE PASS
7511-102420-0026 THEY HAD HEARD OUR SHOT AND CAME ACROSS TO SEE WHAT LUCK WHAT IVER IS THE MATTER WITH YE ASKED MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY MISTER HAYNES TOLD HER THEY HAD HEARD THE NOISE BUT HAD THOUGHT IT THUNDER MISTER HAYNES TOLD ME THAT IF I WOULD CHIRK UP
7511-102420-0027 HE WOULD GIVE ME HIS ELK TEETH THOUGH I DON'T ADMIRE THEM THEY ARE CONSIDERED VALUABLE HOWEVER HIS ELK WAS A COW AND THEY DON'T HAVE AS NICE TEETH AS DO BULLS WE HAD LUNCH AND THE MEN COVERED THE ELK WITH PINE BOUGHS
7511-102420-0028 TO KEEP THE CAMP ROBBERS FROM PECKING IT FULL OF HOLES NEXT DAY THE MEN WOULD COME WITH THE HORSES AND PACK IT IN TO CAMP WE ALL FELT REFRESHED SO WE STARTED ON THE TRAIL OF THOSE THAT GOT AWAY
7511-102420-0029 FOR A WHILE WALKING WAS EASY AND WE MADE PRETTY GOOD TIME THEN WE HAD A ROCKY HILL TO GET OVER WE HAD TO USE CARE WHEN WE GOT INTO THE TIMBER THERE WERE MARSHY PLACES WHICH TRIED US SORELY
7511-102420-0030 AND WINDFALL SO THICK THAT WE COULD HARDLY GET THROUGH WE WERE OBLIGED TO PICK OUR WAY CAREFULLY TO AVOID NOISE AND WE WERE ALL TOGETHER NOT HAVING COME TO A PLACE WHERE IT SEEMED BETTER TO SEPARATE
7511-102420-0031 WE HAD ABOUT RESOLVED TO GO TO OUR HORSES WHEN WE HEARD A VOLLEY OF SHOTS THAT IS SOMEBODY BUNCH SHOOTING SAID MISTER STRUBLE THEY ARE IN BREWSTER LAKE PARK BY THE SOUND THAT MEANS THAT THE ELK WILL PASS HERE IN A SHORT TIME AND WE MAY GET A SHOT
7511-102420-0032 THE ELK WILL BE HERE LONG BEFORE THE MEN SINCE THE MEN HAVE NO HORSES SO LET'S HURRY AND GET PLACED ALONG THE ONLY PLACE THEY CAN GET OUT WE'LL GET OUR LIMIT WE HASTILY SECRETED OURSELVES ALONG THE NARROW GORGE THROUGH WHICH THE ELK MUST PASS
7511-102420-0033 WE WERE ALL ON ONE SIDE AND MISTER HAYNES SAID TO ME REST YOUR GUN ON THAT ROCK AND AIM AT THE FIRST RIB BACK OF THE SHOULDER IF YOU SHOOT HAPHAZARD YOU MAY CRIPPLE AN ELK AND LET IT GET AWAY TO DIE IN MISERY SO MAKE SURE WHEN YOU FIRE
7511-102420-0034 IT DIDN'T SEEM A MINUTE BEFORE WE HEARD THE BEAT OF THEIR HOOFS AND A QUEER PANTING NOISE THAT I CAN'T DESCRIBE FIRST CAME A BEAUTIFUL THING WITH HIS HEAD HELD HIGH
7511-102420-0035 HIS EYES WERE STARTLED AND HIS SHINING BLACK MANE SEEMED TO BRISTLE I HEARD THE REPORT OF GUNS AND HE TUMBLED IN A CONFUSED HEAP HE TRIED TO RISE BUT OTHERS COMING LEAPED OVER HIM AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN SOME MORE SHOTS
7511-102420-0036 AND THOSE BEHIND TURNED AND WENT BACK THE WAY THEY HAD COME MISTER HAYNES SHOUTED TO ME SHOOT SHOOT WHY DON'T YOU SHOOT SO I FIRED MY KRAG BUT NEXT I FOUND MYSELF PICKING MYSELF UP
7511-102420-0037 AND WONDERING WHO HAD STRUCK ME AND FOR WHAT I WAS SO DIZZY I COULD SCARCELY MOVE BUT I GOT DOWN TO WHERE THE OTHERS WERE EXCITEDLY ADMIRING THE TWO DEAD ELK THAT THEY SAID WERE THE VICTIMS OF MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY'S GUN
7511-102420-0038 SHE WAS AS EXCITED AND DELIGHTED AS IF SHE HAD NEVER DECLARED SHE WOULD NOT KILL ANYTHING SURE IT'S MANY A MEAL THEY'LL MAKE FOR LITTLE HUNGRY MOUTHS SHE SAID SHE WAS RUBBING HER SHOULDER RUEFULLY
7511-102420-0039 I THOUGHT OLD GOLIAR HAD HIT ME A BIFF WITH A BLACKTHORN SHILALEY SHE REMARKED MISTER HAYNES TURNED TO ME AND SAID YOU ARE A DANDY HUNTER YOU DIDN'T SHOOT AT ALL UNTIL AFTER THE ELK WERE GONE
7511-102420-0040 AND THE WAY YOU HELD YOUR GUN IT IS A WONDER IT DIDN'T KNOCK YOUR HEAD OFF INSTEAD OF JUST SMASHING YOUR JAW THE MEN WORKED AS FAST AS THEY COULD AT THE ELK AND WE HELPED AS MUCH AS WE COULD BUT IT WAS DARK BEFORE WE REACHED CAMP
7511-102420-0041 SUPPER WAS READY BUT I WENT TO BED AT ONCE THEY ALL THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED BUT IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS SO STIFF AND SORE I COULD HARDLY MOVE AND SO TIRED I COULDN'T SLEEP NEXT MORNING MY JAW AND NECK WERE SO SWOLLEN
7511-102420-0042 THAT I HATED ANY ONE TO SEE ME AND MY HEAD ACHED FOR TWO DAYS IT HAS BEEN SNOWING FOR A LONG TIME BUT CLYDE SAYS HE WILL TAKE ME HUNTING WHEN IT STOPS
7511-102420-0043 AND GO BACK EMPTY HANDED AND PARTLY TO GET A REST FROM MISTER MURRY'S EVERLASTING ACCORDION MISTER MURRY IS AN OLD TIME ACQUAINTANCE OF MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY'S HE HAS A RANCH DOWN ON THE RIVER SOMEWHERE MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY HAS NOT SEEN HIM FOR YEARS
7511-102420-0044 DIDN'T KNOW HE LIVED UP HERE HE HAD SEEN THE GAME WARDEN FROM WHOM SHE HAD PROCURED HER LICENSE AND SO HUNTED UP OUR CAMP HE IS AN ODD LOOKING INDIVIDUAL WITH SAD EYES AND A DROOPING MOUTH WHICH GIVES HIS FACE A MOST HOPELESS REPROACHFUL EXPRESSION
7511-102420-0045 HIS NOSE HOWEVER SEEMS TO UPSET THE ORIGINAL PLAN FOR IT IS LONG AND THIN AND BENT SLIGHTLY TO ONE SIDE HIS NECK IS LONG AND HIS ADAM'S APPLE SEEMS UNCERTAIN AS TO WHERE IT BELONGS AT SUPPER JERRINE WATCHED IT
7511-102420-0046 AS IF FASCINATED UNTIL I SENT HER FROM THE TABLE AND WENT OUT TO SPEAK TO HER ABOUT GAZING WHY MAMMA SHE SAID I HAD TO LOOK HE HAS SWALLOWED SOMETHING THAT WON'T GO EITHER UP OR DOWN AND I'M FRAID HE'LL CHOKE
7511-102420-0047 ALTHOUGH I CAN'T BRAG ABOUT MISTER MURRY'S APPEARANCE I CAN ABOUT HIS TASTE FOR HE ADMIRES MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY IT SEEMS THAT IN YEARS GONE BY HE HAS MADE ATTEMPTS TO MARRY HER AS HE GOT UP FROM SUPPER THE FIRST NIGHT HE WAS WITH US HE SAID
7511-102420-0048 MARY ELLEN I HAVE A REAL TREAT AND SURPRISE FOR YOU JUST WAIT A FEW MINUTES AN I'LL BET YOU'LL BE HAPPY WE TOOK OUR ACCUSTOMED PLACES AROUND THE FIRE WHILE MISTER MURRY HOBBLED HIS CAYUSE AND TOOK AN ODD LOOKING BUNDLE FROM HIS SADDLE
7511-102420-0049 HE SEATED HIMSELF AND TOOK FROM THE BUNDLE AN ACCORDION HE SET IT UPON HIS KNEE AND BEGAN PULLING AND PUSHING ON IT HE DID WHAT MISTER STRUBLE SAID WAS DOLING A DOLEFUL TUNE EVERY ONE TOOK IT GOOD NATUREDLY
7511-102420-0050 BUT WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO RUN NIGGER RUN AND THE OLD GRAY HOSS COME A TEARIN OUT THE WILDERNESS I'LL SING THEM TO YOU WHEN I COME TO DENVER
7635-105409-0000 MARGUERITE'S ACHING HEART STOOD STILL SHE FELT MORE THAN SHE HEARD THE MEN ON THE WATCH PREPARING FOR THE FIGHT HER SENSES TOLD HER THAT EACH WITH SWORD IN HAND WAS CROUCHING READY FOR THE SPRING
7635-105409-0001 THE VOICE CAME NEARER AND NEARER IN THE VAST IMMENSITY OF THESE LONELY CLIFFS WITH THE LOUD MURMUR OF THE SEA BELOW IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY HOW NEAR OR HOW FAR NOR YET FROM WHICH DIRECTION CAME THAT CHEERFUL SINGER WHO SANG TO GOD TO SAVE HIS KING WHILST HE HIMSELF WAS IN SUCH DEADLY DANGER
7635-105409-0002 FELT THAT HER VERY LIFE WAS SLIPPING AWAY AS IF WHEN THAT VOICE DREW NEARER WHEN THAT SINGER BECAME ENTRAPPED SHE DISTINCTLY HEARD THE CLICK OF DESGAS GUN CLOSE TO HER NO NO NO NO OH GOD IN HEAVEN THIS CANNOT BE
7635-105409-0003 LET ARMAND'S BLOOD THEN BE ON HER OWN HEAD LET HER BE BRANDED AS HIS MURDERER LET EVEN HE WHOM SHE LOVED DESPISE AND LOATHE HER FOR THIS BUT GOD OH GOD SAVE HIM AT ANY COST WITH A WILD SHRIEK SHE SPRANG TO HER FEET AND DARTED ROUND THE ROCK
7635-105409-0004 ARMAND ARMAND FOR GOD'S SAKE FIRE YOUR LEADER IS NEAR HE IS COMING HE IS BETRAYED ARMAND ARMAND FIRE IN HEAVEN'S NAME SHE WAS SEIZED AND THROWN TO THE GROUND SHE LAY THERE MOANING BRUISED NOT CARING BUT STILL HALF SOBBING HALF SHRIEKING
7635-105409-0005 PERCY MY HUSBAND FOR GOD'S SAKE FLY ARMAND ARMAND WHY DON'T YOU FIRE
7635-105409-0006 SOMETHING WAS THROWN OVER HER FACE SHE COULD NOT BREATHE AND PERFORCE SHE WAS SILENT THE BOLD SINGER TOO HAD BECOME SILENT WARNED NO DOUBT OF HIS IMPENDING DANGER BY MARGUERITE'S FRANTIC SHRIEKS THE MEN HAD SPRUNG TO THEIR FEET THERE WAS NO NEED FOR FURTHER SILENCE ON THEIR PART
7635-105409-0007 THE VERY CLIFFS ECHOED THE POOR HEART BROKEN WOMAN'S SCREAMS CHAUVELIN WITH A MUTTERED OATH WHICH BODED NO GOOD TO HER WHO HAD DARED TO UPSET HIS MOST CHERISHED PLANS HAD HASTILY SHOUTED THE WORD OF COMMAND INTO IT MY MEN AND LET NO ONE ESCAPE FROM THAT HUT ALIVE
7635-105409-0008 THE MOON HAD ONCE MORE EMERGED FROM BETWEEN THE CLOUDS THE DARKNESS ON THE CLIFFS HAD GONE GIVING PLACE ONCE MORE TO BRILLIANT SILVERY LIGHT SOME OF THE SOLDIERS HAD RUSHED TO THE ROUGH WOODEN DOOR OF THE HUT WHILST ONE OF THEM KEPT GUARD OVER MARGUERITE
7635-105409-0009 THE DOOR WAS PARTIALLY OPEN ONE OF THE SOLDIERS PUSHED IT FURTHER BUT WITHIN ALL WAS DARKNESS THE CHARCOAL FIRE ONLY LIGHTING WITH A DIM RED LIGHT THE FURTHEST CORNER OF THE HUT THE SOLDIERS PAUSED AUTOMATICALLY AT THE DOOR LIKE MACHINES WAITING FOR FURTHER ORDERS
7635-105409-0010 WAS FOR THE MOMENT PARALYZED WITH ASTONISHMENT WHEN HE SAW THE SOLDIERS STANDING THERE AT ATTENTION LIKE SENTRIES ON GUARD WHILST NOT A SOUND PROCEEDED FROM THE HUT FILLED WITH STRANGE ANXIOUS FOREBODING HE TOO WENT TO THE DOOR OF THE HUT AND PEERING INTO THE GLOOM HE ASKED QUICKLY
7635-105409-0011 WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS I THINK CITOYEN THAT THERE IS NO ONE THERE NOW REPLIED ONE OF THE SOLDIERS IMPERTURBABLY YOU HAVE NOT LET THOSE FOUR MEN GO THUNDERED CHAUVELIN MENACINGLY I ORDERED YOU TO LET NO MAN ESCAPE ALIVE QUICK AFTER THEM ALL OF YOU QUICK IN EVERY DIRECTION
7635-105409-0012 THE MEN OBEDIENT AS MACHINES RUSHED DOWN THE ROCKY INCLINE TOWARDS THE BEACH SOME GOING OFF TO RIGHT AND LEFT AS FAST AS THEIR FEET COULD CARRY THEM YOU AND YOUR MEN WILL PAY WITH YOUR LIVES FOR THIS BLUNDER CITOYEN SERGEANT SAID CHAUVELIN VICIOUSLY TO THE SERGEANT WHO HAD BEEN IN CHARGE OF THE MEN
7635-105409-0013 AND YOU TOO CITOYEN HE ADDED TURNING WITH A SNARL TO DESGAS FOR DISOBEYING MY ORDERS YOU ORDERED US TO WAIT CITOYEN UNTIL THE TALL ENGLISHMAN ARRIVED AND JOINED THE FOUR MEN IN THE HUT NO ONE CAME SAID THE SERGEANT SULLENLY
7635-105409-0014 BUT I ORDERED YOU JUST NOW WHEN THE WOMAN SCREAMED TO RUSH IN AND LET NO ONE ESCAPE BUT CITOYEN THE FOUR MEN WHO WERE THERE BEFORE HAD BEEN GONE SOME TIME I THINK YOU THINK YOU SAID CHAUVELIN ALMOST CHOKING WITH FURY AND YOU LET THEM GO
7635-105409-0015 YOU ORDERED US TO WAIT CITOYEN PROTESTED THE SERGEANT AND TO IMPLICITLY OBEY YOUR COMMANDS ON PAIN OF DEATH WE WAITED
7635-105409-0016 WHICH WAY DID THEY GO ASKED CHAUVELIN I COULD NOT TELL CITOYEN SAID THE SERGEANT THEY WENT STRAIGHT DOWN THE CLIFF FIRST THEN DISAPPEARED BEHIND SOME BOULDERS HUSH WHAT WAS THAT ALL THREE MEN LISTENED ATTENTIVELY
7635-105409-0017 IN THE FAR VERY FAR DISTANCE COULD BE HEARD FAINTLY ECHOING AND ALREADY DYING AWAY THE QUICK SHARP SPLASH OF HALF A DOZEN OARS CHAUVELIN TOOK OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED THE PERSPIRATION FROM HIS FOREHEAD THE SCHOONER'S BOAT WAS ALL HE GASPED
7635-105409-0018 EVIDENTLY ARMAND SAINT JUST AND HIS THREE COMPANIONS HAD MANAGED TO CREEP ALONG THE SIDE OF THE CLIFFS WHILST THE MEN LIKE TRUE SOLDIERS OF THE WELL DRILLED REPUBLICAN ARMY HAD WITH BLIND OBEDIENCE AND IN FEAR OF THEIR OWN LIVES IMPLICITLY OBEYED CHAUVELIN'S ORDERS
7635-105409-0019 TO WAIT FOR THE TALL ENGLISHMAN WHO WAS THE IMPORTANT CAPTURE THEY HAD NO DOUBT REACHED ONE OF THE CREEKS WHICH JUT FAR OUT TO SEA ON THIS COAST AT INTERVALS BEHIND THIS THE BOAT OF THE DAY DREAM MUST HAVE BEEN ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THEM
7635-105409-0020 IT NEEDED ALL CHAUVELIN'S NERVE AND PRESENCE OF MIND NOT TO GIVE WAY TO A USELESS AND UNDIGNIFIED ACCESS OF RAGE
7635-105409-0021 HOW HE HAD CONTRIVED TO REACH THE HUT WITHOUT BEING SEEN BY ONE OF THE THIRTY SOLDIERS WHO GUARDED THE SPOT WAS MORE THAN CHAUVELIN COULD CONCEIVE THAT HE HAD DONE SO BEFORE THE THIRTY MEN HAD ARRIVED ON THE CLIFF WAS OF COURSE FAIRLY CLEAR
7635-105409-0022 THERE WERE NO FAIRIES AND HOBGOBLINS ABOUT
7635-105409-0023 BY THAT TIME THE FOUR FUGITIVES MUST HAVE REACHED THE CREEK AND GOT INTO THE BOAT AND THE NEAREST CREEK WAS MORE THAN A MILE FROM THE HUT WHERE HAD THAT DARING SINGER GOT TO UNLESS SATAN HIMSELF HAD LENT HIM WINGS HE COULD NOT HAVE COVERED THAT MILE ON A ROCKY CLIFF IN THE SPACE OF TWO MINUTES
7635-105409-0024 ONE OR TWO OF THE MEN WHO HAD RUN AFTER THE FUGITIVES WERE NOW SLOWLY WORKING THEIR WAY UP THE CLIFF ONE OF THEM REACHED CHAUVELIN'S SIDE AT THE VERY MOMENT THAT THIS HOPE AROSE IN THE ASTUTE DIPLOMATIST'S HEART
7635-105409-0025 WE WERE TOO LATE CITOYEN THE SOLDIER SAID WE REACHED THE BEACH JUST BEFORE THE MOON WAS HIDDEN BY THAT BANK OF CLOUDS THE BOAT HAD UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN ON THE LOOK OUT BEHIND THAT FIRST CREEK A MILE OFF BUT SHE HAD SHOVED OFF SOME TIME AGO WHEN WE GOT TO THE BEACH AND WAS ALREADY SOME WAY OUT TO SEA
7635-105409-0026 YES SAID CHAUVELIN WITH EAGER IMPATIENCE SHE HAD SHOVED OFF SOME TIME AGO YOU SAID AND THE NEAREST CREEK IS A MILE FURTHER ON YES CITOYEN I RAN ALL THE WAY STRAIGHT TO THE BEACH THOUGH I GUESSED THE BOAT WOULD HAVE WAITED SOMEWHERE NEAR THE CREEK AS THE TIDE WOULD REACH THERE EARLIEST
7635-105409-0027 WITH A RAPID GLANCE CHAUVELIN NOTED ITS CONTENTS THE CAULDRON PLACED CLOSE UNDER AN APERTURE IN THE WALL AND CONTAINING THE LAST FEW DYING EMBERS OF BURNED CHARCOAL A COUPLE OF STOOLS OVERTURNED AS IF IN THE HASTE OF SUDDEN DEPARTURE
7635-105409-0028 THEN THE FISHERMAN'S TOOLS AND HIS NETS LYING IN ONE CORNER AND BESIDE THEM SOMETHING SMALL AND WHITE PICK THAT UP SAID CHAUVELIN TO THE SERGEANT POINTING TO THIS WHITE SCRAP AND BRING IT TO ME
7635-105409-0029 IT WAS A CRUMPLED PIECE OF PAPER EVIDENTLY FORGOTTEN THERE BY THE FUGITIVES IN THEIR HURRY TO GET AWAY THE SERGEANT MUCH AWED BY THE CITOYEN'S OBVIOUS RAGE AND IMPATIENCE PICKED THE PAPER UP AND HANDED IT RESPECTFULLY TO CHAUVELIN READ IT SERGEANT SAID THE LATTER CURTLY
7635-105409-0030 IT IS ALMOST ILLEGIBLE CITOYEN A FEARFUL SCRAWL I ORDERED YOU TO READ IT REPEATED CHAUVELIN VICIOUSLY THE SERGEANT BY THE LIGHT OF HIS LANTERN BEGAN DECIPHERING THE FEW HASTILY SCRAWLED WORDS
7635-105409-0031 I CANNOT QUITE REACH YOU WITHOUT RISKING YOUR LIVES AND ENDANGERING THE SUCCESS OF YOUR RESCUE WHEN YOU RECEIVE THIS WAIT TWO MINUTES THEN CREEP OUT OF THE HUT ONE BY ONE TURN TO YOUR LEFT SHARPLY AND CREEP CAUTIOUSLY DOWN THE CLIFF
7635-105409-0032 I SHALL BE THERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THEY MUST WAIT FOR ME AT A SAFE DISTANCE OUT AT SEA TILL THEY HEAR THE USUAL SIGNAL DO NOT DELAY AND OBEY THESE INSTRUCTIONS IMPLICITLY THEN THERE IS THE SIGNATURE CITOYEN ADDED THE SERGEANT AS HE HANDED THE PAPER BACK TO CHAUVELIN
7635-105409-0033 BUT THE LATTER HAD NOT WAITED AN INSTANT ONE PHRASE OF THE MOMENTOUS SCRAWL HAD CAUGHT HIS EAR
7635-105409-0034 THAT PHRASE MIGHT YET MEAN VICTORY FOR HIM WHICH OF YOU KNOWS THIS COAST WELL HE SHOUTED TO HIS MEN WHO NOW ONE BY ONE ALL RETURNED FROM THEIR FRUITLESS RUN AND WERE ALL ASSEMBLED ONCE MORE ROUND THE HUT
7635-105409-0035 THERE IS CITOYEN I KNOW IT WELL THE ENGLISHMAN IS HOPING TO REACH THAT CREEK
7635-105409-0036 AT ANY RATE THERE IS A CHANCE TO GET HIM YET A THOUSAND FRANCS TO EACH MAN WHO GETS TO THAT CREEK BEFORE THAT LONG LEGGED ENGLISHMAN I KNOW OF A SHORT CUT ACROSS THE CLIFFS SAID THE SOLDIER AND WITH AN ENTHUSIASTIC SHOUT HE RUSHED FORWARD FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY HIS COMRADES
7635-105409-0037 WITHIN A FEW MINUTES THEIR RUNNING FOOTSTEPS HAD DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE
7635-105409-0038 HIS WELL LAID PLAN HAD FAILED ITS SEQUEL WAS PROBLEMATICAL THERE WAS STILL A GREAT CHANCE NOW THAT THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL MIGHT YET ESCAPE AND CHAUVELIN WITH THAT UNREASONING FURY WHICH SOMETIMES ASSAILS A STRONG NATURE WAS LONGING TO VENT HIS RAGE ON SOMEBODY
7635-105409-0039 THE SOLDIERS WERE HOLDING MARGUERITE PINIONED TO THE GROUND THOUGH SHE POOR SOUL WAS NOT MAKING THE FAINTEST STRUGGLE
7635-105409-0040 HER EYES CIRCLED BY DEEP PURPLE LINES THAT TOLD OF LONG SLEEPLESS NIGHTS HER HAIR MATTED AND DAMP ROUND HER FOREHEAD HER LIPS PARTED IN A SHARP CURVE THAT SPOKE OF PHYSICAL PAIN
7635-105409-0041 BUT THE HARD VENGEFUL HEART OF HER BAFFLED ENEMY
7635-105409-0042 OBEDIENTLY THE SOLDIERS ROSE TO THEIR FEET YOU'D BETTER TRY AND FIND THAT FOOTPATH AGAIN FOR ME AND THAT BROKEN DOWN CART WE LEFT ON THE ROAD THEN SUDDENLY A BRIGHT IDEA SEEMED TO STRIKE HIM AH BY THE BYE WHERE IS THE JEW
7635-105409-0043 I GAGGED HIM AND TIED HIS LEGS TOGETHER AS YOU COMMANDED FROM THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY A PLAINTIVE MOAN REACHED CHAUVELIN'S EARS HE FOLLOWED HIS SECRETARY WHO LED THE WAY TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HUT
7635-105409-0044 WHERE FALLEN INTO AN ABSOLUTE HEAP OF DEJECTION WITH HIS LEGS TIGHTLY PINIONED TOGETHER AND HIS MOUTH GAGGED LAY THE UNFORTUNATE DESCENDANT OF ISRAEL HIS FACE IN THE SILVERY LIGHT OF THE MOON LOOKED POSITIVELY GHASTLY WITH TERROR
7635-105409-0045 WHILE A PITEOUS WAIL ESCAPED HIS BLOODLESS LIPS THE ROPE WHICH HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN WOUND ROUND HIS SHOULDERS AND ARMS HAD EVIDENTLY GIVEN WAY FOR IT LAY IN A TANGLE ABOUT HIS BODY
7635-105409-0046 LIKE A TERRIFIED CHICKEN WHICH LOOKS UPON A LINE OF WHITE CHALK DRAWN ON A TABLE AS ON A STRING WHICH PARALYZES ITS MOVEMENTS BRING THE COWARDLY BRUTE HERE COMMANDED CHAUVELIN
7635-105409-0047 HE CERTAINLY FELT EXCEEDINGLY VICIOUS AND SINCE HE HAD NO REASONABLE GROUNDS FOR VENTING HIS ILL HUMOUR ON THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD BUT TOO PUNCTUALLY OBEYED HIS ORDERS HE FELT THAT THE SON OF THE DESPISED RACE WOULD PROVE AN EXCELLENT BUTT
7635-105409-0048 WITH TRUE FRENCH CONTEMPT OF THE JEW WHICH HAS SURVIVED THE LAPSE OF CENTURIES EVEN TO THIS DAY HE WOULD NOT GO TOO NEAR HIM BUT SAID WITH BITING SARCASM AS THE WRETCHED OLD MAN WAS BROUGHT IN FULL LIGHT OF THE MOON BY THE TWO SOLDIERS
7635-105409-0049 I SUPPOSE NOW THAT BEING A JEW YOU HAVE A GOOD MEMORY FOR BARGAINS ANSWER HE AGAIN COMMANDED AS THE JEW WITH TREMBLING LIPS SEEMED TOO FRIGHTENED TO SPEAK YES YOUR HONOUR STAMMERED THE POOR WRETCH
7635-105409-0050 B BUT YOUR HONOUR THERE IS NO BUT I SAID DO YOU REMEMBER
7635-105409-0051 YOUR HONOUR HE VENTURED IMPLORINGLY SINCE YOUR TERROR SEEMS TO HAVE PARALYZED YOUR TONGUE SAID CHAUVELIN SARCASTICALLY I MUST NEEDS REFRESH YOUR MEMORY
7635-105409-0052 IT WAS AGREED BETWEEN US THAT IF WE OVERTOOK MY FRIEND THE TALL STRANGER BEFORE HE REACHED THIS PLACE YOU WERE TO HAVE TEN PIECES OF GOLD A LOW MOAN ESCAPED FROM THE JEW'S TREMBLING LIPS
7635-105409-0053 BUT ADDED CHAUVELIN WITH SLOW EMPHASIS IF YOU DECEIVED ME IN YOUR PROMISE YOU WERE TO HAVE A SOUND BEATING ONE THAT WOULD TEACH YOU NOT TO TELL LIES I DID NOT YOUR HONOUR I SWEAR IT BY ABRAHAM
7635-105409-0054 AND BY ALL THE OTHER PATRIARCHS I KNOW UNFORTUNATELY THEY ARE STILL IN HADES I BELIEVE ACCORDING TO YOUR CREED AND CANNOT HELP YOU MUCH IN YOUR PRESENT TROUBLE NOW YOU DID NOT FULFIL YOUR SHARE OF THE BARGAIN BUT I AM READY TO FULFIL MINE HERE HE ADDED TURNING TO THE SOLDIERS
7635-105409-0055 I THINK I CAN RELY ON YOU CITOYEN SOLDIERS LAUGHED CHAUVELIN MALICIOUSLY TO GIVE THIS OLD LIAR THE BEST AND SOUNDEST BEATING HE HAS EVER EXPERIENCED BUT DON'T KILL HIM HE ADDED DRILY WE WILL OBEY CITOYEN REPLIED THE SOLDIERS AS IMPERTURBABLY AS EVER
7635-105409-0056 HE DID NOT WAIT TO SEE HIS ORDERS CARRIED OUT HE KNEW THAT HE COULD TRUST THESE SOLDIERS WHO WERE STILL SMARTING UNDER HIS REBUKE NOT TO MINCE MATTERS WHEN GIVEN A FREE HAND TO BELABOUR A THIRD PARTY
7635-105409-0057 THE JEW AND THE WOMAN CAN LOOK AFTER EACH OTHER HE ADDED ROUGHLY UNTIL WE CAN SEND SOMEBODY FOR THEM IN THE MORNING THEY CAN'T RUN AWAY VERY FAR IN THEIR PRESENT CONDITION AND WE CANNOT BE TROUBLED WITH THEM JUST NOW CHAUVELIN HAD NOT GIVEN UP ALL HOPE HIS MEN HE KNEW WERE SPURRED ON BY THE HOPE OF THE REWARD
7635-105409-0058 BUT HE FELT LESS SURE NOW THE ENGLISHMAN'S AUDACITY HAD BAFFLED HIM ONCE WHILST THE WOODEN HEADED STUPIDITY OF THE SOLDIERS AND THE INTERFERENCE OF A WOMAN HAD TURNED HIS HAND WHICH HELD ALL THE TRUMPS INTO A LOSING ONE
7635-105409-0059 IT WAS A LONG IF AND CHAUVELIN STOOD FOR A MOMENT QUITE STILL AND ENROLLED THIRTY ODD PEOPLE IN ONE LONG OVERWHELMING ANATHEMA NATURE POETIC SILENT BALMY THE BRIGHT MOON THE CALM SILVERY SEA SPOKE OF BEAUTY AND OF REST
7635-105409-0060 AND CHAUVELIN CURSED NATURE CURSED MAN AND WOMAN AND ABOVE ALL HE CURSED ALL LONG LEGGED MEDDLESOME BRITISH ENIGMAS WITH ONE GIGANTIC CURSE THE HOWLS OF THE JEW BEHIND HIM UNDERGOING HIS PUNISHMENT SENT A BALM THROUGH HIS HEART
7635-105409-0061 OVERBURDENED AS IT WAS WITH REVENGEFUL MALICE HE SMILED IT EASED HIS MIND TO THINK THAT SOME HUMAN BEING AT LEAST WAS LIKE HIMSELF NOT ALTOGETHER AT PEACE WITH MANKIND HE TURNED AND TOOK A LAST LOOK AT THE LONELY BIT OF COAST WHERE STOOD THE WOODEN HUT NOW BATHED IN MOONLIGHT
7635-105409-0062 THE SCENE OF THE GREATEST DISCOMFITURE EVER EXPERIENCED BY A LEADING MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY AGAINST A ROCK ON A HARD BED OF STONE LAY THE UNCONSCIOUS FIGURE OF MARGUERITE BLAKENEY
7635-105409-0063 WHILE SOME FEW PACES FURTHER ON THE UNFORTUNATE JEW WAS RECEIVING ON HIS BROAD BACK THE BLOWS OF TWO STOUT LEATHER BELTS WIELDED BY THE STOLID ARMS OF TWO STURDY SOLDIERS OF THE REPUBLIC THE HOWLS OF BENJAMIN ROSENBAUM WERE FIT TO MAKE THE DEAD RISE FROM THEIR GRAVES
7635-105409-0064 THAT WILL DO COMMANDED CHAUVELIN AS THE JEW'S MOANS BECAME MORE FEEBLE AND THE POOR WRETCH SEEMED TO HAVE FAINTED AWAY WE DON'T WANT TO KILL HIM
7635-105409-0065 LEAVE HIM THERE SAID CHAUVELIN AND LEAD THE WAY NOW QUICKLY TO THE CART I'LL FOLLOW HE WALKED UP TO WHERE MARGUERITE LAY AND LOOKED DOWN INTO HER FACE
7635-105409-0066 SHE HAD EVIDENTLY RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS AND WAS MAKING FEEBLE EFFORTS TO RAISE HERSELF HER LARGE BLUE EYES WERE LOOKING AT THE MOONLIT SCENE ROUND HER WITH A SCARED AND TERRIFIED LOOK THEY RESTED WITH A MIXTURE OF HORROR AND PITY ON THE JEW
7635-105409-0067 WITH MOCK GALLANTRY HE STOOPED AND RAISED HER ICY COLD HAND TO HIS LIPS WHICH SENT A THRILL OF INDESCRIBABLE LOATHING THROUGH MARGUERITE'S WEARY FRAME
7635-105409-0068 I MUCH REGRET FAIR LADY HE SAID IN HIS MOST SUAVE TONES THAT CIRCUMSTANCES OVER WHICH I HAVE NO CONTROL COMPEL ME TO LEAVE YOU HERE FOR THE MOMENT BUT I GO AWAY SECURE IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I DO NOT LEAVE YOU UNPROTECTED
7635-105409-0069 I HAVE NO DOUBT AT DAWN I WILL SEND AN ESCORT FOR YOU UNTIL THEN I FEEL SURE THAT YOU WILL FIND HIM DEVOTED THOUGH PERHAPS A TRIFLE SLOW MARGUERITE ONLY HAD THE STRENGTH TO TURN HER HEAD AWAY HER HEART WAS BROKEN WITH CRUEL ANGUISH
7635-105409-0070 WHAT HAD BECOME OF PERCY WHAT OF ARMAND SHE KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AFTER SHE HEARD THE CHEERFUL SONG GOD SAVE THE KING WHICH SHE BELIEVED TO BE THE SIGNAL OF DEATH I MYSELF CONCLUDED CHAUVELIN MUST NOW VERY RELUCTANTLY LEAVE YOU
7635-105409-0071 AU REVOIR FAIR LADY WE MEET I HOPE SOON IN LONDON SHALL I SEE YOU AT THE PRINCE OF WALES GARDEN PARTY NO AH WELL AU REVOIR REMEMBER ME I PRAY TO SIR PERCY BLAKENEY
7635-105661-0000 THE PERSONS EMPLOYED IN THE FINANCES ARMIES FLEETS AND MAGISTRACY ARE INSTANCES OF THIS ORDER OF MEN IT MAY NATURALLY BE THOUGHT AT FIRST SIGHT THAT THE ECCLESIASTICS BELONG TO THE FIRST CLASS AND THAT THEIR ENCOURAGEMENT AS WELL AS THAT OF LAWYERS AND PHYSICIANS
7635-105661-0001 MAY SAFELY BE INTRUSTED TO THE LIBERALITY OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ATTACHED TO THEIR DOCTRINES AND WHO FIND BENEFIT OR CONSOLATION FROM THEIR SPIRITUAL MINISTRY AND ASSISTANCE
7635-105661-0002 FROM THEIR INCREASING PRACTICE STUDY AND ATTENTION BUT IF WE CONSIDER THE MATTER MORE CLOSELY WE SHALL FIND THAT THIS INTERESTED DILIGENCE OF THE CLERGY IS WHAT EVERY WISE LEGISLATOR WILL STUDY TO PREVENT BECAUSE IN EVERY RELIGION EXCEPT THE TRUE IT IS HIGHLY PERNICIOUS
7635-105661-0003 AND IT HAS EVEN A NATURAL TENDENCY TO PERVERT THE TRUE BY INFUSING INTO IT A STRONG MIXTURE OF SUPERSTITION FOLLY AND DELUSION EACH GHOSTLY PRACTITIONER IN ORDER TO RENDER HIMSELF MORE PRECIOUS AND SACRED IN THE EYES OF HIS RETAINERS
7635-105661-0004 WILL INSPIRE THEM WITH THE MOST VIOLENT ABHORRENCE OF ALL OTHER SECTS AND CONTINUALLY ENDEAVOR BY SOME NOVELTY TO EXCITE THE LANGUID DEVOTION OF HIS AUDIENCE NO REGARD WILL BE PAID TO TRUTH MORALS OR DECENCY IN THE DOCTRINES INCULCATED
7635-105661-0005 EVERY TENET WILL BE ADOPTED THAT BEST SUITS THE DISORDERLY AFFECTIONS OF THE HUMAN FRAME CUSTOMERS WILL BE DRAWN TO EACH CONVENTICLE BY NEW INDUSTRY AND ADDRESS IN PRACTISING ON THE PASSIONS AND CREDULITY OF THE POPULACE
7635-105661-0006 AND IN THE END THE CIVIL MAGISTRATE WILL FIND THAT HE HAS DEARLY PAID FOR HIS PRETENDED FRUGALITY IN SAVING A FIXED ESTABLISHMENT FOR THE PRIESTS AND THAT IN REALITY THE MOST DECENT AND ADVANTAGEOUS COMPOSITION WHICH HE CAN MAKE WITH THE SPIRITUAL GUIDES
7635-105661-0007 IS TO BRIBE THEIR INDOLENCE BY ASSIGNING STATED SALARIES TO THEIR PROFESSION AND RENDERING IT SUPERFLUOUS FOR THEM TO BE FURTHER ACTIVE THAN MERELY TO PREVENT THEIR FLOCK FROM STRAYING IN QUEST OF NEW PASTURES
7635-105661-0008 AND IN THIS MANNER ECCLESIASTICAL ESTABLISHMENTS THOUGH COMMONLY THEY AROSE AT FIRST FROM RELIGIOUS VIEWS PROVE IN THE END ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE POLITICAL INTERESTS OF SOCIETY
7635-105661-0009 BUT WE MAY OBSERVE THAT FEW ECCLESIASTICAL ESTABLISHMENTS HAVE BEEN FIXED UPON A WORSE FOUNDATION THAN THAT OF THE CHURCH OF ROME OR HAVE BEEN ATTENDED WITH CIRCUMSTANCES MORE HURTFUL TO THE PEACE AND HAPPINESS OF MANKIND
7635-105661-0010 THE LARGE REVENUES PRIVILEGES IMMUNITIES AND POWERS OF THE CLERGY RENDERED THEM FORMIDABLE TO THE CIVIL MAGISTRATE AND ARMED WITH TOO EXTENSIVE AUTHORITY AN ORDER OF MEN WHO ALWAYS ADHERE CLOSELY TOGETHER
7635-105661-0011 THE HIGHER DIGNITIES OF THE CHURCH SERVED INDEED TO THE SUPPORT OF GENTRY AND NOBILITY BUT BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MONASTERIES MANY OF THE LOWEST VULGAR WERE TAKEN FROM THE USEFUL ARTS AND MAINTAINED IN THOSE RECEPTACLES OF SLOTH AND IGNORANCE
7635-105661-0012 THE SUPREME HEAD OF THE CHURCH WAS A FOREIGN POTENTATE GUIDED BY INTERESTS ALWAYS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE COMMUNITY SOMETIMES CONTRARY TO THEM AND AS THE HIERARCHY WAS NECESSARILY SOLICITOUS TO PRESERVE A UNITY OF FAITH RITES AND CEREMONIES
7635-105661-0013 ALL LIBERTY OF THOUGHT RAN A MANIFEST RISK OF BEING EXTINGUISHED AND VIOLENT PERSECUTIONS OR WHAT WAS WORSE A STUPID AND ABJECT CREDULITY TOOK PLACE EVERY WHERE TO INCREASE THESE EVILS THE CHURCH
7635-105661-0014 THOUGH SHE POSSESSED LARGE REVENUES WAS NOT CONTENTED WITH HER ACQUISITIONS
7635-105661-0015 SHE EVEN BESTOWED ON EACH INDIVIDUAL PRIEST A POWER OF ENRICHING HIMSELF BY THE VOLUNTARY OBLATIONS OF THE FAITHFUL AND LEFT HIM STILL AN URGENT MOTIVE FOR DILIGENCE AND INDUSTRY IN HIS CALLING
7635-105661-0016 AND THUS THAT CHURCH THOUGH AN EXPENSIVE AND BURDENSOME ESTABLISHMENT WAS LIABLE TO MANY OF THE INCONVENIENCES WHICH BELONG TO AN ORDER OF PRIESTS TRUSTING ENTIRELY TO THEIR OWN ART AND INVENTION FOR OBTAINING A SUBSISTENCE
7635-105661-0017 THE ADVANTAGES ATTENDING THE ROMISH HIERARCHY WERE BUT A SMALL COMPENSATION FOR ITS INCONVENIENCES THE ECCLESIASTICAL PRIVILEGES DURING BARBAROUS TIMES
7635-105661-0018 AND THE POMP AND SPLENDOR OF WORSHIP WHICH BELONGED TO SO OPULENT AN ESTABLISHMENT CONTRIBUTED IN SOME RESPECT TO THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE FINE ARTS AND BEGAN TO DIFFUSE A GENERAL ELEGANCE OF TASTE BY UNITING IT WITH RELIGION
7635-105661-0019 IT WILL EASILY BE CONCEIVED THAT THOUGH THE BALANCE OF EVIL PREVAILED IN THE ROMISH CHURCH THIS WAS NOT THE CHIEF REASON WHICH PRODUCED THE REFORMATION A CONCURRENCE OF INCIDENTS MUST HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO FORWARD THAT GREAT REVOLUTION
7635-105661-0020 IN ORDER TO SUPPORT HIS PROJECTS PLEASURES AND LIBERALITIES THE SCHEME OF SELLING INDULGENCES WAS SUGGESTED TO HIM AS AN EXPEDIENT WHICH HAD OFTEN SERVED IN FORMER TIMES TO DRAW MONEY FROM THE CHRISTIAN WORLD
7635-105661-0021 AND MAKE DEVOUT PEOPLE WILLING CONTRIBUTORS TO THE GRANDEUR AND RICHES OF THE COURT OF ROME THE CHURCH IT WAS SUPPOSED WAS POSSESSED OF A GREAT STOCK OF MERIT AS BEING ENTITLED TO ALL THE GOOD WORKS OF ALL THE SAINTS BEYOND WHAT WERE EMPLOYED IN THEIR OWN JUSTIFICATION
7635-105661-0022 AND EVEN TO THE MERITS OF CHRIST HIMSELF WHICH WERE INFINITE AND UNBOUNDED AND FROM THIS UNEXHAUSTED TREASURY THE POPE MIGHT RETAIL PARTICULAR PORTIONS AND BY THAT TRAFFIC ACQUIRE MONEY TO BE EMPLOYED IN PIOUS PURPOSES IN RESISTING THE INFIDELS
7635-105661-0023 OR SUBDUING SCHISMATICS WHEN THE MONEY CAME INTO HIS EXCHEQUER THE GREATER PART OF IT WAS USUALLY DIVERTED TO OTHER PURPOSES IT IS COMMONLY BELIEVED THAT LEO FROM THE PENETRATION OF HIS GENIUS AND HIS FAMILIARITY WITH ANCIENT LITERATURE
7635-105661-0024 WAS FULLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE RIDICULE AND FALSITY OF THE DOCTRINES WHICH AS SUPREME PONTIFF
7635-105661-0025 MAY JUSTLY IN PART BE ASCRIBED TO THE LATE INVENTION OF PRINTING AND REVIVAL OF LEARNING NOT THAT REASON BORE ANY CONSIDERABLE SHARE IN OPENING MEN'S EYES WITH REGARD TO THE IMPOSTURES OF THE ROMISH CHURCH FOR OF ALL BRANCHES OF LITERATURE PHILOSOPHY HAD
7635-105661-0026 AS YET AND TILL LONG AFTERWARDS MADE THE MOST INCONSIDERABLE PROGRESS NEITHER IS THERE ANY INSTANCE THAT ARGUMENT HAS EVER BEEN ABLE TO FREE THE PEOPLE FROM THAT ENORMOUS LOAD OF ABSURDITY
7635-105661-0027 WITH WHICH SUPERSTITION HAS EVERY WHERE OVERWHELMED THEM NOT TO MENTION THAT THE RAPID ADVANCE OF THE LUTHERAN DOCTRINE AND THE VIOLENCE WITH WHICH IT WAS EMBRACED PROVE SUFFICIENTLY THAT IT OWED NOT ITS SUCCESS TO REASON AND REFLECTION
7635-105661-0028 WERE PROPAGATED MORE QUICKLY AND IN GREATER NUMBERS THE MINDS OF MEN SOMEWHAT AWAKENED FROM A PROFOUND SLEEP OF SO MANY CENTURIES WERE PREPARED FOR EVERY NOVELTY AND SCRUPLED LESS TO TREAD IN ANY UNUSUAL PATH WHICH WAS OPENED TO THEM
7635-105661-0029 AND AS COPIES OF THE SCRIPTURES AND OTHER ANCIENT MONUMENTS OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH BECAME MORE COMMON
7635-105661-0030 MANY OF THE POWERS INDEED ASSUMED BY THE CHURCH OF ROME WERE VERY ANCIENT AND WERE PRIOR TO ALMOST EVERY POLITICAL GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED IN EUROPE
7635-105661-0031 WHICH TIME MIGHT RENDER VALID BUT APPEALED STILL TO A DIVINE ORIGIN MEN WERE TEMPTED TO LOOK INTO THEIR PRIMITIVE CHARTER AND THEY COULD WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY PERCEIVE ITS DEFECT IN TRUTH AND AUTHENTICITY
7635-105661-0032 IN ORDER TO BESTOW ON THIS TOPIC THE GREATER INFLUENCE LUTHER AND HIS FOLLOWERS NOT SATISFIED WITH OPPOSING THE PRETENDED DIVINITY OF THE ROMISH CHURCH AND DISPLAYING THE TEMPORAL INCONVENIENCES OF THAT ESTABLISHMENT
7635-105661-0033 CARRIED MATTERS MUCH FURTHER AND TREATED THE RELIGION OF THEIR ANCESTORS AS ABOMINABLE DETESTABLE DAMNABLE FORETOLD BY SACRED WRIT ITSELF AS THE SOURCE OF ALL WICKEDNESS AND POLLUTION THEY DENOMINATED THE POPE ANTICHRIST
7635-105661-0034 CALLED HIS COMMUNION THE SCARLET WHORE AND GAVE TO ROME THE APPELLATION OF BABYLON EXPRESSIONS WHICH HOWEVER APPLIED WERE TO BE FOUND IN SCRIPTURE AND WHICH WERE BETTER CALCULATED TO OPERATE ON THE MULTITUDE THAN THE MOST SOLID ARGUMENTS
7635-105661-0035 EXCITED BY CONTEST AND PERSECUTION ON THE ONE HAND BY SUCCESS AND APPLAUSE ON THE OTHER MANY OF THE REFORMERS CARRIED TO THE GREATEST EXTREMITIES THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE CHURCH OF ROME
7635-105661-0036 AND IN CONTRADICTION TO THE MULTIPLIED SUPERSTITIONS WITH WHICH THAT COMMUNION WAS LOADED THEY ADOPTED AN ENTHUSIASTIC STRAIN OF DEVOTION WHICH ADMITTED OF NO OBSERVANCES RITES OR CEREMONIES BUT PLACED ALL MERIT
7635-105661-0037 IN A MYSTERIOUS SPECIES OF FAITH IN INWARD VISION RAPTURE AND ECSTASY THE NEW SECTARIES SEIZED WITH THIS SPIRIT WERE INDEFATIGABLE IN THE PROPAGATION OF THEIR DOCTRINE
7635-105661-0038 AGAINST THE ECCLESIASTICAL JURISDICTION THE LUTHERANS ADVANCED DOCTRINES FAVORABLE IN SOME RESPECT TO THE TEMPORAL AUTHORITY OF SOVEREIGNS THEY INVEIGHED AGAINST THE ABUSES OF THE COURT OF ROME
7635-105661-0039 IN THOSE POWERS OF WHICH THE ENCROACHING SPIRIT OF THE ECCLESIASTICS ESPECIALLY OF THE SOVEREIGN PONTIFF HAD SO LONG BEREAVED THEM THEY CONDEMNED CELIBACY AND MONASTIC VOWS AND THEREBY OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CONVENTS
7635-105661-0040 TO THOSE WHO WERE EITHER TIRED OF THE OBEDIENCE AND CHASTITY OR DISGUSTED WITH THE LICENSE IN WHICH THEY HAD HITHERTO LIVED THEY BLAMED THE EXCESSIVE RICHES THE IDLENESS
7635-105661-0041 THE LIBERTINISM OF THE CLERGY AND POINTED OUT THEIR TREASURES AND REVENUES AS LAWFUL SPOIL TO THE FIRST INVADER AND AS THE ECCLESIASTICS HAD HITHERTO CONDUCTED A WILLING AND A STUPID AUDIENCE AND WERE TOTALLY UNACQUAINTED WITH CONTROVERSY MUCH MORE
7635-105661-0042 WITH EVERY SPECIES OF TRUE LITERATURE THEY WERE UNABLE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST MEN ARMED WITH AUTHORITIES QUOTATIONS AND POPULAR TOPICS AND QUALIFIED TO TRIUMPH IN EVERY ALTERCATION OR DEBATE
7635-105661-0043 DIED IN THE FLOWER OF HIS AGE A LITTLE AFTER HE RECEIVED THE KING'S BOOK AGAINST LUTHER AND HE WAS SUCCEEDED IN THE PAPAL CHAIR BY ADRIAN A FLEMING WHO HAD BEEN TUTOR TO THE EMPEROR CHARLES THIS MAN WAS FITTED TO GAIN ON THE REFORMERS BY THE INTEGRITY CANDOR
7635-105661-0044 AND SIMPLICITY OF MANNERS WHICH DISTINGUISHED HIS CHARACTER BUT SO VIOLENT WERE THEIR PREJUDICES AGAINST THE CHURCH HE RATHER HURT THE CAUSE BY HIS IMPRUDENT EXERCISE OF THOSE VIRTUES HE FRANKLY CONFESSED THAT MANY ABOMINABLE AND DETESTABLE PRACTICES PREVAILED IN THE COURT OF ROME
7635-105661-0045 AND BY THIS SINCERE AVOWAL HE GAVE OCCASION OF MUCH TRIUMPH TO THE LUTHERANS THIS PONTIFF ALSO WHOSE PENETRATION WAS NOT EQUAL TO HIS GOOD INTENTIONS WAS SEDUCED TO CONCUR IN THAT LEAGUE WHICH CHARLES AND HENRY HAD FORMED AGAINST FRANCE
7635-105661-0046 AND WHO DREADED THE RESENTMENT OF THAT HAUGHTY MINISTER WAS SOLICITOUS TO REPAIR THE BREACH MADE IN THEIR FRIENDSHIP BY THIS INCIDENT
7635-105661-0047 HE RENEWED TO WOLSEY ALL THE PROMISES WHICH HE HAD MADE HIM OF SECONDING HIS PRETENSIONS TO THE PAPAL THRONE
7635-105661-0048 TO THE NEXT ELECTION THE EMPEROR RENEWED THE TREATY MADE AT BRUGES
7635-105661-0049 THE MORE TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH HENRY AND THE ENGLISH NATION HE GAVE TO SURREY ADMIRAL OF ENGLAND A COMMISSION FOR BEING ADMIRAL OF HIS DOMINIONS AND HE HIMSELF WAS INSTALLED KNIGHT OF THE GARTER AT LONDON
7780-274562-0000 THE AZURE FIELDS OF HEAVEN WERE SEMBLED RIGHT IN A LARGE ROUND SET WITH FLOW'RS OF LIGHT THE FLOWERS DE LUCE AND THE ROUND SPARKS OF DEW THAT HUNG UPON THEIR AZURE LEAVES DID SHOW LIKE TWINKLING STARS THAT SPARKLE IN THE EV'NING BLUE
7780-274562-0001 GILES FLETCHER NO MORE REMARKABLE MAN EVER LIVED THAN MY FRIEND THE YOUNG ELLISON HE WAS REMARKABLE IN THE ENTIRE AND CONTINUOUS PROFUSION OF GOOD GIFTS EVER LAVISHED UPON HIM BY FORTUNE
7780-274562-0002 FROM HIS CRADLE TO HIS GRAVE A GALE OF THE BLANDEST PROSPERITY BORE HIM ALONG NOR DO I USE THE WORD PROSPERITY IN ITS MERE WORDLY OR EXTERNAL SENSE I MEAN IT AS SYNONYMOUS WITH HAPPINESS
7780-274562-0003 THE PERSON OF WHOM I SPEAK SEEMED BORN FOR THE PURPOSE OF FORESHADOWING THE WILD DOCTRINES OF TURGOT PRICE PRIESTLEY AND CONDORCET OF EXEMPLIFYING BY INDIVIDUAL INSTANCE
7780-274562-0004 WHAT HAS BEEN DEEMED THE MERE CHIMERA OF THE PERFECTIONISTS IN THE BRIEF EXISTENCE OF ELLISON I FANCY THAT I HAVE SEEN REFUTED THE DOGMA THAT IN MAN'S PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL NATURE LIES SOME HIDDEN PRINCIPLE
7780-274562-0005 THE ANTAGONIST OF BLISS AN INTIMATE AND ANXIOUS EXAMINATION OF HIS CAREER HAS TAUGHT ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN GENERAL FROM THE VIOLATION OF A FEW SIMPLE LAWS OF HUMANITY ARISES THE WRETCHEDNESS OF MANKIND
7780-274562-0006 THAT AS A SPECIES WE HAVE IN OUR POSSESSION THE AS YET UNWROUGHT ELEMENTS OF CONTENT AND THAT EVEN NOW IN THE PRESENT BLINDNESS AND DARKNESS OF ALL IDEA ON THE GREAT QUESTION OF THE SOCIAL CONDITION
7780-274562-0007 IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE THAT MAN THE INDIVIDUAL UNDER CERTAIN UNUSUAL AND HIGHLY FORTUITOUS CONDITIONS MAY BE HAPPY WITH OPINIONS SUCH AS THESE WAS MY YOUNG FRIEND FULLY IMBUED
7780-274562-0008 AND THUS IS IT ESPECIALLY WORTHY OF OBSERVATION THAT THE UNINTERRUPTED ENJOYMENT WHICH DISTINGUISHED HIS LIFE WAS IN GREAT PART THE RESULT OF PRECONCERT IT IS INDEED EVIDENT
7780-274562-0009 EXPERIENCE MISTER ELLISON WOULD HAVE FOUND HIMSELF PRECIPITATED BY THE VERY EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESSES OF HIS LIFE INTO THE COMMON VORTEX OF UNHAPPINESS WHICH YAWNS FOR THOSE OF PREEMINENT ENDOWMENTS
7780-274562-0010 BUT IT IS BY NO MEANS MY PRESENT OBJECT TO PEN AN ESSAY ON HAPPINESS THE IDEAS OF MY FRIEND MAY BE SUMMED UP IN A FEW WORDS HE ADMITTED BUT FOUR UNVARYING LAWS
7780-274562-0011 OR RATHER ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF BLISS THAT WHICH HE CONSIDERED CHIEF WAS STRANGE TO SAY THE SIMPLE AND PURELY PHYSICAL ONE OF FREE EXERCISE IN THE OPEN AIR THE HEALTH HE SAID
7780-274562-0012 ATTAINABLE BY OTHER MEANS THAN THIS IS SCARCELY WORTH THE NAME HE POINTED TO THE TILLERS OF THE EARTH THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO AS A CLASS ARE PROVERBIALLY MORE HAPPY THAN OTHERS
7780-274562-0013 AND THEN HE INSTANCED THE HIGH ECSTASIES OF THE FOX HUNTER HIS SECOND PRINCIPLE WAS THE LOVE OF WOMAN
7780-274562-0014 HIS FOURTH WAS AN OBJECT OF UNCEASING PURSUIT AND HE HELD THAT OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL THE EXTENT OF HAPPINESS WAS PROPORTIONED TO THE SPIRITUALITY OF THIS OBJECT
7780-274562-0015 I HAVE SAID THAT ELLISON WAS REMARKABLE IN THE CONTINUOUS PROFUSION OF GOOD GIFTS LAVISHED UPON HIM BY FORTUNE IN PERSONAL GRACE AND BEAUTY HE EXCEEDED ALL MEN
7780-274562-0016 HIS INTELLECT WAS OF THAT ORDER TO WHICH THE ATTAINMENT OF KNOWLEDGE IS LESS A LABOR THAN A NECESSITY AND AN INTUITION HIS FAMILY WAS ONE OF THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS OF THE EMPIRE HIS BRIDE WAS THE LOVELIEST AND MOST DEVOTED OF WOMEN
7780-274562-0017 HIS POSSESSIONS HAD BEEN ALWAYS AMPLE BUT UPON THE ATTAINMENT OF HIS ONE AND TWENTIETH YEAR IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT ONE OF THOSE EXTRAORDINARY FREAKS OF FATE HAD BEEN PLAYED IN HIS BEHALF WHICH STARTLE THE WHOLE SOCIAL WORLD AMID WHICH THEY OCCUR
7780-274562-0018 AND SELDOM FAIL RADICALLY TO ALTER THE ENTIRE MORAL CONSTITUTION OF THOSE WHO ARE THEIR OBJECTS IT APPEARS THAT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS PRIOR TO MISTER ELLISON'S ATTAINMENT OF HIS MAJORITY THERE HAD DIED IN A REMOTE PROVINCE
7780-274562-0019 ELLISON THIS GENTLEMEN HAD AMASSED A PRINCELY FORTUNE AND HAVING NO VERY IMMEDIATE CONNEXIONS CONCEIVED THE WHIM OF SUFFERING HIS WEALTH TO ACCUMULATE FOR A CENTURY AFTER HIS DECEASE
7780-274562-0020 MINUTELY AND SAGACIOUSLY DIRECTING THE VARIOUS MODES OF INVESTMENT HE BEQUEATHED THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT TO THE NEAREST OF BLOOD BEARING THE NAME ELLISON WHO SHOULD BE ALIVE AT THE END OF THE HUNDRED YEARS
7780-274562-0021 MANY FUTILE ATTEMPTS HAD BEEN MADE TO SET ASIDE THIS SINGULAR BEQUEST THEIR EX POST FACTO CHARACTER RENDERED THEM ABORTIVE
7780-274562-0022 A DECREE FINALLY OBTAINED FORBIDDING ALL SIMILAR ACCUMULATIONS THIS ACT DID NOT PREVENT YOUNG ELLISON UPON HIS TWENTY FIRST BIRTH DAY
7780-274562-0023 FROM ENTERING INTO POSSESSION AS THE HEIR OF HIS ANCESTOR SEABRIGHT OF A FORTUNE OF
7780-274562-0024 THERE WERE OF COURSE MANY SPECULATIONS AS TO THE MODE OF ITS DISPOSAL THE GIGANTIC MAGNITUDE AND THE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE NATURE OF THE SUM DAZZLED AND BEWILDERED ALL WHO THOUGHT UPON THE TOPIC
7780-274562-0025 THE POSSESSOR OF ANY APPRECIABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN IMAGINED TO PERFORM ANY ONE OF A THOUSAND THINGS WITH RICHES MERELY SURPASSING THOSE OF ANY CITIZEN
7780-274562-0026 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO SUPPOSE HIM ENGAGING TO SUPREME EXCESS IN THE FASHIONABLE EXTRAVAGANCES OF HIS TIME OR BUSYING HIMSELF WITH POLITICAL INTRIGUES OR AIMING AT MINISTERIAL POWER OR PURCHASING INCREASE OF NOBILITY
7780-274562-0027 OR DEVISING GORGEOUS ARCHITECTURAL PILES OR COLLECTING LARGE SPECIMENS OF VIRTU OR PLAYING THE MUNIFICENT PATRON OF LETTERS AND ART OR ENDOWING AND BESTOWING HIS NAME UPON EXTENSIVE INSTITUTIONS OF CHARITY
7780-274562-0028 BUT FOR THE INCONCEIVABLE WEALTH IN THE ACTUAL POSSESSION OF THE YOUNG HEIR THESE OBJECTS AND ALL ORDINARY OBJECTS WERE FELT TO BE INADEQUATE RECOURSE WAS HAD TO FIGURES
7780-274562-0029 AND FIGURES BUT SUFFICED TO CONFOUND IT WAS SEEN THAT EVEN AT THREE PER CENT THE ANNUAL INCOME OF THE INHERITANCE AMOUNTED TO NO LESS THAN THIRTEEN MILLIONS AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
7780-274562-0030 WHICH WAS ONE MILLION AND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PER MONTH OR THIRTY SIX THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX PER DAY OR ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE PER HOUR OR
7780-274562-0031 SIX AND TWENTY DOLLARS FOR EVERY MINUTE THAT FLEW THUS THE USUAL TRACK OF SUPPOSITION WAS THOROUGHLY BROKEN UP MEN KNEW NOT WHAT TO IMAGINE
7780-274562-0032 ENRICHING WHOLE TROOPS OF HIS RELATIVES BY DIVISION OF HIS SUPERABUNDANCE I WAS NOT SURPRISED HOWEVER
7780-274562-0033 NOR WAS I GREATLY ASTONISHED AT THE NATURE OF HIS DECISION IN THE WIDEST AND NOBLEST SENSE HE WAS A POET HE COMPREHENDED MOREOVER THE TRUE CHARACTER THE AUGUST AIMS
7780-274562-0034 THE SUPREME MAJESTY AND DIGNITY OF THE POETIC SENTIMENT THE PROPER GRATIFICATION OF THE SENTIMENT HE INSTINCTIVELY FELT TO LIE IN THE CREATION OF NOVEL FORMS OF BEAUTY SOME PECULIARITIES EITHER IN HIS EARLY EDUCATION
7780-274562-0035 OR IN THE NATURE OF HIS INTELLECT
7780-274562-0036 AND IT WAS THIS BIAS PERHAPS WHICH IMPERCEPTIBLY LED HIM TO PERCEIVE THAT THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS IF NOT THE SOLE LEGITIMATE FIELD FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE POETIC SENTIMENT
7780-274562-0037 WAS TO BE FOUND IN THE CREATION OF NOVEL MOODS OF PURELY PHYSICAL LOVELINESS THUS IT HAPPENED THAT HE BECAME NEITHER MUSICIAN NOR POET IF WE USE THIS LATTER TERM IN ITS EVERY DAY ACCEPTATION
7780-274562-0038 OR IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT HE BECAME NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER IN PURSUANCE OF AN IDEA OF HIS WHICH I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THE IDEA THAT IN THE CONTEMPT OF AMBITION LAY ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES OF HAPPINESS ON EARTH
7780-274562-0039 IS IT NOT INDEED POSSIBLE THAT WHILE A HIGH ORDER OF GENIUS IS NECESSARILY AMBITIOUS THE HIGHEST IS INVARIABLY ABOVE THAT WHICH IS TERMED AMBITION
7780-274562-0040 AND MAY IT NOT THUS HAPPEN THAT MANY FAR GREATER THAN MILTON HAVE CONTENTEDLY REMAINED MUTE AND INGLORIOUS I BELIEVE THE WORLD HAS NEVER YET SEEN AND THAT
7780-274562-0041 UNLESS THROUGH SOME SERIES OF ACCIDENTS GOADING THE NOBLEST ORDER OF MIND INTO DISTASTEFUL EXERTION THE WORLD WILL NEVER BEHOLD THAT FULL EXTENT OF TRIUMPHANT EXECUTION IN THE RICHER PRODUCTIONS OF ART
7780-274562-0042 OF WHICH THE HUMAN NATURE IS ABSOLUTELY CAPABLE MISTER ELLISON BECAME NEITHER MUSICIAN NOR POET ALTHOUGH NO MAN LIVED MORE PROFOUNDLY ENAMORED BOTH OF MUSIC AND THE MUSE
7780-274562-0043 UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAN THOSE WHICH INVESTED HIM IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE WOULD HAVE BECOME A PAINTER THE FIELD OF SCULPTURE ALTHOUGH IN ITS NATURE RIGIDLY POETICAL
7780-274562-0044 WAS TOO LIMITED IN ITS EXTENT AND IN ITS CONSEQUENCES TO HAVE OCCUPIED AT ANY TIME MUCH OF HIS ATTENTION AND I HAVE NOW MENTIONED ALL THE PROVINCES IN WHICH
7780-274562-0045 EVEN THE MOST LIBERAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE POETIC SENTIMENT HAS DECLARED THIS SENTIMENT CAPABLE OF EXPATIATING I MEAN THE MOST LIBERAL PUBLIC OR RECOGNIZED CONCEPTION OF THE IDEA INVOLVED IN THE PHRASE POETIC SENTIMENT
7780-274562-0046 NO DEFINITION HAD SPOKEN OF THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER AS OF THE POET YET MY FRIEND COULD NOT FAIL TO PERCEIVE THAT THE CREATION OF THE LANDSCAPE GARDEN OFFERED TO THE TRUE MUSE THE MOST MAGNIFICENT OF OPPORTUNITIES
7780-274562-0047 HERE WAS INDEED THE FAIREST FIELD FOR THE DISPLAY OF INVENTION OR IMAGINATION IN THE ENDLESS COMBINING OF FORMS OF NOVEL BEAUTY
7780-274562-0048 THE ELEMENTS WHICH SHOULD ENTER INTO COMBINATION BEING AT ALL TIMES AND BY A VAST SUPERIORITY THE MOST GLORIOUS WHICH THE EARTH COULD AFFORD IN THE MULTIFORM OF THE TREE
7780-274562-0049 AND IN THE MULTICOLOR OF THE FLOWER HE RECOGNIZED THE MOST DIRECT AND THE MOST ENERGETIC EFFORTS OF NATURE AT PHYSICAL LOVELINESS AND IN THE DIRECTION OR CONCENTRATION OF THIS EFFORT OR
7780-274562-0050 HE PERCEIVED THAT HE SHOULD BE EMPLOYING THE BEST MEANS LABORING TO THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE IN THE FULFILMENT OF HIS DESTINY AS POET
7780-274562-0051 ITS ADAPTATION TO THE EYES WHICH WERE TO BEHOLD IT UPON EARTH IN HIS EXPLANATION OF THIS PHRASEOLOGY MISTER ELLISON DID MUCH TOWARDS SOLVING WHAT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME AN ENIGMA I MEAN THE FACT
7780-274562-0052 WHICH NONE BUT THE IGNORANT DISPUTE THAT NO SUCH COMBINATIONS OF SCENERY EXIST IN NATURE AS THE PAINTER OF GENIUS HAS IN HIS POWER TO PRODUCE
7780-274562-0053 WHILE THE COMPONENT PARTS MAY EXCEED INDIVIDUALLY THE HIGHEST SKILL OF THE ARTIST THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE PARTS WILL ALWAYS BE SUSCEPTIBLE OF IMPROVEMENT IN SHORT NO POSITION CAN BE ATTAINED
7780-274562-0054 FROM WHICH AN ARTISTICAL EYE LOOKING STEADILY WILL NOT FIND MATTER OF OFFENCE IN WHAT IS TECHNICALLY TERMED THE COMPOSITION OF A NATURAL LANDSCAPE AND YET HOW UNINTELLIGIBLE IS THIS
7780-274562-0055 IN ALL OTHER MATTERS WE ARE JUSTLY INSTRUCTED TO REGARD NATURE AS SUPREME WITH HER DETAILS WE SHRINK FROM COMPETITION WHO SHALL PRESUME TO IMITATE THE COLORS OF THE TULIP OR TO IMPROVE THE PROPORTIONS OF THE LILY OF THE VALLEY
7780-274562-0056 THE CRITICISM WHICH SAYS OF SCULPTURE OR OF PORTRAITURE THAT NATURE IS TO BE EXALTED RATHER THAN IMITATED IS IN ERROR NO PICTORIAL OR SCULPTURAL COMBINATIONS OF POINTS
7780-274562-0057 OF HUMAN LOVELINESS DO MORE THAN APPROACH THE LIVING AND BREATHING HUMAN BEAUTY AS IT GLADDENS OUR DAILY PATH BYRON WHO OFTEN ERRED ERRED NOT IN SAYING I'VE SEEN MORE LIVING BEAUTY
7780-274562-0058 RIPE AND REAL THAN ALL THE NONSENSE OF THEIR STONE IDEAL IN LANDSCAPE ALONE IS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE CRITIC TRUE AND HAVING FELT ITS TRUTH HERE
7780-274562-0059 IT IS BUT THE HEADLONG SPIRIT OF GENERALIZATION WHICH HAS INDUCED HIM TO PRONOUNCE IT TRUE THROUGHOUT ALL THE DOMAINS OF ART HAVING I SAY FELT ITS TRUTH HERE
7780-274562-0060 FOR THE FEELING IS NO AFFECTATION OR CHIMERA THE MATHEMATICS AFFORD NO MORE ABSOLUTE DEMONSTRATIONS THAN THE SENTIMENT OF HIS ART YIELDS TO THE ARTIST HE NOT ONLY BELIEVES
7780-274562-0061 BUT POSITIVELY KNOWS THAT SUCH AND SUCH APPARENTLY ARBITRARY ARRANGEMENTS OF MATTER OR FORM CONSTITUTE AND ALONE CONSTITUTE THE TRUE BEAUTY
7780-274562-0062 YET HIS REASONS HAVE NOT YET BEEN MATURED INTO EXPRESSION IT REMAINS FOR A MORE PROFOUND ANALYSIS THAN THE WORLD HAS YET SEEN FULLY TO INVESTIGATE AND EXPRESS THEM
7780-274562-0063 IN HIS INSTINCTIVE OPINIONS BY THE CONCURRENCE OF ALL HIS COMPEERS LET A COMPOSITION BE DEFECTIVE LET AN EMENDATION BE WROUGHT IN ITS MERE ARRANGEMENT OF FORM
7780-274562-0064 LET THIS EMENDATION BE SUBMITTED TO EVERY ARTIST IN THE WORLD BY EACH WILL ITS NECESSITY BE ADMITTED AND EVEN FAR MORE THAN THIS IN REMEDY OF THE DEFECTIVE COMPOSITION
7780-274562-0065 EACH INSULATED MEMBER OF THE FRATERNITY WILL SUGGEST THE IDENTICAL EMENDATION I REPEAT THAT IN LANDSCAPE ARRANGEMENTS OR COLLOCATIONS ALONE IS THE PHYSICAL NATURE SUSCEPTIBLE OF EXALTATION AND THAT
7780-274562-0066 THEREFORE HER SUSCEPTIBILITY OF IMPROVEMENT
7780-274562-0067 IT WAS MISTER ELLISON WHO FIRST SUGGESTED THE IDEA THAT WHAT WE REGARDED AS IMPROVEMENT OR EXALTATION OF THE NATURAL BEAUTY
7780-274562-0068 THAT EACH ALTERATION OR DISTURBANCE OF THE PRIMITIVE SCENERY MIGHT POSSIBLY EFFECT A BLEMISH IN THE PICTURE IF WE COULD SUPPOSE THIS PICTURE VIEWED AT LARGE FROM SOME REMOTE POINT IN THE HEAVENS
7780-274562-0069 IT IS EASILY UNDERSTOOD SAYS MISTER ELLISON THAT WHAT MIGHT IMPROVE A CLOSELY SCRUTINIZED DETAIL MIGHT AT THE SAME TIME INJURE A GENERAL AND MORE DISTANTLY OBSERVED EFFECT
7780-274562-0070 HE SPOKE UPON THIS TOPIC WITH WARMTH REGARDING NOT SO MUCH ITS IMMEDIATE OR OBVIOUS IMPORTANCE WHICH IS LITTLE
7780-274562-0071 OR OF THE COLLATERAL PROPOSITIONS WHICH IT MIGHT SERVE TO CORROBORATE OR SUSTAIN THERE MIGHT BE A CLASS OF BEINGS HUMAN ONCE BUT NOW TO HUMANITY INVISIBLE
7780-274562-0072 FOR WHOSE SCRUTINY AND FOR WHOSE REFINED APPRECIATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL MORE ESPECIALLY THAN FOR OUR OWN HAD BEEN SET IN ORDER BY GOD THE GREAT LANDSCAPE GARDEN OF THE WHOLE EARTH IN THE COURSE OF OUR DISCUSSION
7780-274562-0073 TO HAVE WELL TREATED THIS THEME THERE ARE PROPERLY HE WRITES BUT TWO STYLES OF LANDSCAPE GARDENING THE NATURAL AND THE ARTIFICIAL
7780-274562-0074 ONE SEEKS TO RECALL THE ORIGINAL BEAUTY OF THE COUNTRY BY ADAPTING ITS MEANS TO THE SURROUNDING SCENERY CULTIVATING TREES IN HARMONY WITH THE HILLS OR PLAIN OF THE NEIGHBORING LAND
7780-274562-0075 DETECTING AND BRINGING INTO PRACTICE THOSE NICE RELATIONS OF SIZE PROPORTION AND COLOR WHICH HID FROM THE COMMON OBSERVER ARE REVEALED EVERYWHERE TO THE EXPERIENCED STUDENT OF NATURE THE RESULT OF THE NATURAL STYLE OF GARDENING
7780-274562-0076 IN THE PREVALENCE OF A BEAUTIFUL HARMONY AND ORDER THAN IN THE CREATION OF ANY SPECIAL WONDERS OR MIRACLES THE ARTIFICIAL STYLE HAS AS MANY VARIETIES AS THERE ARE DIFFERENT TASTES TO GRATIFY
7780-274562-0077 IT HAS A CERTAIN GENERAL RELATION TO THE VARIOUS STYLES OF BUILDING THERE ARE THE STATELY AVENUES AND RETIREMENTS OF VERSAILLES ITALIAN TERRACES AND A VARIOUS MIXED OLD ENGLISH STYLE
7780-274562-0078 WHICH BEARS SOME RELATION TO THE DOMESTIC GOTHIC OR ENGLISH ELIZABETHAN ARCHITECTURE WHATEVER MAY BE SAID AGAINST THE ABUSES OF THE ARTIFICIAL LANDSCAPE GARDENING
7780-274562-0079 A MIXTURE OF PURE ART IN A GARDEN SCENE ADDS TO IT A GREAT BEAUTY THIS IS PARTLY PLEASING TO THE EYE BY THE SHOW OF ORDER AND DESIGN AND PARTLY MORAL A TERRACE
7780-274562-0080 CALLS UP AT ONCE TO THE EYE THE FAIR FORMS THAT HAVE PASSED THERE IN OTHER DAYS THE SLIGHTEST EXHIBITION OF ART IS AN EVIDENCE OF CARE AND HUMAN INTEREST
7780-274562-0081 FROM WHAT I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED SAID MISTER ELLISON YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT I REJECT THE IDEA HERE EXPRESSED OF RECALLING THE ORIGINAL BEAUTY OF THE COUNTRY
7780-274562-0082 THE ORIGINAL BEAUTY IS NEVER SO GREAT AS THAT WHICH MAY BE INTRODUCED OF COURSE MUCH DEPENDS UPON THE SELECTION OF A SPOT WITH CAPABILITIES
7780-274562-0083 WHAT IS SAID IN RESPECT TO THE DETECTING AND BRINGING INTO PRACTICE THOSE NICE RELATIONS OF SIZE PROPORTION AND COLOR IS A MERE VAGUENESS OF SPEECH WHICH MAY MEAN MUCH OR LITTLE OR NOTHING
7780-274562-0084 THAT THE TRUE RESULT OF THE NATURAL STYLE OF GARDENING IS SEEN RATHER IN THE ABSENCE OF ALL DEFECTS AND INCONGRUITIES THAN IN THE CREATION OF ANY SPECIAL WONDERS OR MIRACLES
7780-274562-0085 IS A PROPOSITION BETTER SUITED TO THE GROVELLING APPREHENSION OF THE HERD THAN TO THE FERVID DREAMS OF THE MAN OF GENIUS THE MERIT SUGGESTED IS AT BEST NEGATIVE
7780-274562-0086 AND APPERTAINS TO THAT HOBBLING CRITICISM WHICH IN LETTERS WOULD ELEVATE ADDISON INTO APOTHEOSIS IN TRUTH
7780-274562-0087 APPEALS DIRECTLY TO THE UNDERSTANDING AND CAN THUS BE FORESHADOWED IN RULE THE LOFTIER MERIT WHICH BREATHES AND FLAMES IN INVENTION OR CREATION CAN BE APPREHENDED SOLELY IN ITS RESULTS
7780-274562-0088 RULE APPLIES BUT TO THE EXCELLENCES OF AVOIDANCE TO THE VIRTUES WHICH DENY OR REFRAIN BEYOND THESE THE CRITICAL ART CAN BUT SUGGEST
7780-274562-0089 WE MAY BE INSTRUCTED TO BUILD AN ODYSSEY BUT IT IS IN VAIN THAT WE ARE TOLD HOW TO CONCEIVE A TEMPEST AN INFERNO A PROMETHEUS BOUND A NIGHTINGALE
7780-274562-0090 SUCH AS THAT OF KEATS OR THE SENSITIVE PLANT OF SHELLEY BUT THE THING DONE
7780-274562-0091 THE SOPHISTS OF THE NEGATIVE SCHOOL WHO THROUGH INABILITY TO CREATE HAVE SCOFFED AT CREATION ARE NOW FOUND THE LOUDEST IN APPLAUSE WHAT
7780-274562-0092 IN ITS CHRYSALIS CONDITION OF PRINCIPLE AFFRONTED THEIR DEMURE REASON NEVER FAILS IN ITS MATURITY OF ACCOMPLISHMENT TO EXTORT ADMIRATION FROM THEIR INSTINCT OF THE BEAUTIFUL OR OF THE SUBLIME
7780-274562-0093 ARE LESS OBJECTIONABLE A MIXTURE OF PURE ART IN A GARDEN SCENE ADDS TO IT A GREAT BEAUTY THIS IS JUST AND THE REFERENCE TO THE SENSE OF HUMAN INTEREST IS EQUALLY SO
7780-274562-0094 I REPEAT THAT THE PRINCIPLE HERE EXPRESSED IS INCONTROVERTIBLE BUT THERE MAY BE SOMETHING EVEN BEYOND IT THERE MAY BE AN OBJECT IN FULL KEEPING WITH THE PRINCIPLE SUGGESTED
7780-274562-0095 YET WHICH IF ATTAINED WOULD LEND A CHARM TO THE LANDSCAPE GARDEN IMMEASURABLY SURPASSING THAT WHICH A MERELY HUMAN INTEREST COULD BESTOW
7780-274562-0096 SO IMBUE HIS DESIGNS AT ONCE WITH EXTENT AND NOVELTY OF BEAUTY AS TO CONVEY THE SENTIMENT OF SPIRITUAL INTERFERENCE IT WILL BE SEEN THAT IN BRINGING ABOUT SUCH RESULT
7780-274562-0097 HE SECURES ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF INTEREST OR DESIGN WHILE RELIEVING HIS WORK OF ALL THE HARSHNESS AND TECHNICALITY OF ART
7780-274562-0098 IN THE MOST SAVAGE OF THE SCENES OF PURE NATURE THERE IS APPARENT THE ART OF A CREATOR YET IS THIS ART APPARENT ONLY TO REFLECTION IN NO RESPECT HAS IT THE OBVIOUS FORCE OF A FEELING
7780-274562-0099 NOW IF WE IMAGINE THIS SENSE OF THE ALMIGHTY DESIGN TO BE HARMONIZED IN A MEASURABLE DEGREE IF WE SUPPOSE A LANDSCAPE WHOSE COMBINED STRANGENESS VASTNESS
7780-274562-0100 DEFINITIVENESS AND MAGNIFICENCE SHALL INSPIRE THE IDEA OF CULTURE OR CARE OR SUPERINTENDENCE ON THE PART OF INTELLIGENCES SUPERIOR YET AKIN TO HUMANITY
7780-274562-0101 THEN THE SENTIMENT OF INTEREST IS PRESERVED WHILE THE ART IS MADE TO ASSUME THE AIR OF AN INTERMEDIATE OR SECONDARY NATURE A NATURE WHICH IS NOT GOD NOR AN EMANATION OF GOD
7780-274562-0102 IN THE SENSE THAT IT IS THE HANDIWORK OF THE ANGELS THAT HOVER BETWEEN MAN AND GOD IT WAS IN DEVOTING HIS GIGANTIC WEALTH TO THE PRACTICAL EMBODIMENT OF A VISION SUCH AS THIS
7780-274562-0103 IN THE FREE EXERCISE IN THE OPEN AIR WHICH RESULTED FROM PERSONAL DIRECTION OF HIS PLANS IN THE CONTINUOUS AND UNCEASING OBJECT WHICH THESE PLANS AFFORD
7780-274562-0104 IN THE CONTEMPT OF AMBITION WHICH IT ENABLED HIM MORE TO FEEL THAN TO AFFECT AND LASTLY IT WAS IN THE COMPANIONSHIP AND SYMPATHY OF A DEVOTED WIFE
7780-274562-0105 THAT ELLISON THOUGHT TO FIND AND FOUND AN EXEMPTION FROM THE ORDINARY CARES OF HUMANITY
7794-295947-0000 ON THE SAME ERRAND AS THEMSELVES AS SOON AS THE CHILDREN SAW THE FOXES THEY PICKED UP A BAMBOO STICK AND TOOK THE CREATURES STEALTHILY IN THE REAR AND WHEN THE OLD FOXES TOOK TO FLIGHT THEY SURROUNDED THEM AND BEAT THEM WITH THE STICK
7794-295947-0001 SO THAT THEY RAN AWAY AS FAST AS THEIR LEGS COULD CARRY THEM BUT TWO OF THE BOYS HELD DOWN THE CUB AND SEIZING IT BY THE SCRUFF OF THE NECK WENT OFF IN HIGH GLEE THE TWO FRIENDS WERE LOOKING ON ALL THE WHILE AND ONE OF THEM RAISING HIS VOICE SHOUTED OUT
7794-295947-0002 HALLO YOU BOYS WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT FOX THE ELDEST OF THE BOYS REPLIED WE'RE GOING TO TAKE HIM HOME AND SELL HIM TO A YOUNG MAN IN OUR VILLAGE HE'LL BUY HIM AND THEN HE'LL BOIL HIM IN A POT AND EAT HIM
7794-295947-0003 WELL REPLIED THE OTHER AFTER CONSIDERING THE MATTER ATTENTIVELY I SUPPOSE IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU WHOM YOU SELL HIM TO YOU'D BETTER LET ME HAVE HIM OH BUT THE YOUNG MAN FROM OUR VILLAGE PROMISED US A GOOD SUM IF WE COULD FIND A FOX
7794-295947-0004 AND GOT US TO COME OUT TO THE HILLS AND CATCH ONE AND SO WE CAN'T SELL HIM TO YOU AT ANY PRICE WELL I SUPPOSE IT CANNOT BE HELPED THEN BUT HOW MUCH WOULD THE YOUNG MAN GIVE YOU FOR THE CUB OH HE'LL GIVE US THREE HUNDRED CASH AT LEAST
7794-295947-0005 AND GAVE HALF A BU TO THE THREE BOYS WHO RAN AWAY DELIGHTED THE MAN'S FRIEND UPON THIS SAID TO HIM WELL CERTAINLY YOU HAVE GOT QUEER TASTES WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP THE FOX FOR
7794-295947-0006 HOW COULD I STAND BY AND SEE LIFE TAKEN IT WAS BUT A LITTLE I SPENT ONLY HALF A BU TO SAVE THE CUB BUT HAD IT COST A FORTUNE I SHOULD NOT HAVE GRUDGED IT I THOUGHT YOU WERE INTIMATE ENOUGH WITH ME TO KNOW MY HEART
7794-295947-0007 BUT TO DAY YOU HAVE ACCUSED ME OF BEING ECCENTRIC AND I SEE HOW MISTAKEN I HAVE BEEN IN YOU HOWEVER OUR FRIENDSHIP SHALL CEASE FROM THIS DAY FORTH AND WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF FIRMNESS
7794-295947-0008 THE OTHER RETIRING BACKWARD AND BOWING WITH HIS HANDS ON HIS KNEES REPLIED INDEED INDEED I AM FILLED WITH ADMIRATION AT THE GOODNESS OF YOUR HEART WHEN I HEAR YOU SPEAK THUS I FEEL MORE THAN EVER HOW GREAT IS THE LOVE I BEAR YOU
7794-295947-0009 SO THEY STROKED IT GENTLY ON THE BACK AND PETTED IT AND AS THE PAIN OF THE WOUND SEEMED TO HAVE SUBSIDED THEY WERE ADMIRING THE PROPERTIES OF THE HERB WHEN OPPOSITE TO THEM THEY SAW THE OLD FOXES SITTING WATCHING THEM BY THE SIDE OF SOME STACKS OF RICE STRAW
7794-295947-0010 LOOK THERE THE OLD FOXES HAVE COME BACK OUT OF FEAR FOR THEIR CUB'S SAFETY COME WE WILL SET IT FREE AND WITH THESE WORDS THEY UNTIED THE STRING ROUND THE CUB'S NECK AND TURNED ITS HEAD TOWARD THE SPOT WHERE THE OLD FOXES SAT
7794-295947-0011 SO WITH PEACE IN THEIR HEARTS THE LATTER WENT OFF TO ANOTHER PLACE AND CHOOSING A PRETTY SPOT PRODUCED THE WINE BOTTLE AND ATE THEIR NOONDAY MEAL AND AFTER A PLEASANT DAY THEY RETURNED TO THEIR HOMES AND BECAME FIRMER FRIENDS THAN EVER
7794-295947-0012 NOW THE MAN WHO HAD RESCUED THE FOX'S CUB WAS A TRADESMAN IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES HE HAD THREE OR FOUR AGENTS AND TWO MAID SERVANTS BESIDES MEN SERVANTS AND ALTOGETHER HE LIVED IN A LIBERAL MANNER HE WAS MARRIED AND THIS UNION HAD BROUGHT HIM ONE SON
7794-295947-0013 EVEN THOUGH OUR CHILD SHOULD DIE FOR IT THEY SAID WE WILL NOT OURSELVES DEPRIVE OTHER CREATURES OF THEIR LIVES BUT YOU WHO LIVE AMONG THE HILLS ARE SURE TO HEAR WHEN YOUR NEIGHBOURS GO OUT FOX HUNTING
7794-295947-0014 WE DON'T CARE WHAT PRICE WE MIGHT HAVE TO PAY FOR A FOX'S LIVER PRAY BUY ONE FOR US AT ANY EXPENSE SO THEY PRESSED HIM TO EXERT HIMSELF ON THEIR BEHALF AND HE HAVING PROMISED FAITHFULLY TO EXECUTE THE COMMISSION WENT HIS WAY
7794-295947-0015 IN THE NIGHT OF THE FOLLOWING DAY THERE CAME A MESSENGER WHO ANNOUNCED HIMSELF AS COMING FROM THE PERSON WHO HAD UNDERTAKEN TO PROCURE THE FOX'S LIVER SO THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WENT OUT TO SEE HIM I HAVE COME FROM MISTER SO AND SO
7794-295947-0016 LAST NIGHT THE FOX'S LIVER THAT YOU REQUIRED FELL INTO HIS HANDS SO HE SENT ME TO BRING IT TO YOU WITH THESE WORDS THE MESSENGER PRODUCED A SMALL JAR ADDING IN A FEW DAYS HE WILL LET YOU KNOW THE PRICE
7794-295947-0017 WHEN HE HAD DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WAS GREATLY PLEASED AND SAID INDEED I AM DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR THIS KINDNESS WHICH WILL SAVE MY SON'S LIFE THEN THE GOOD WIFE CAME OUT AND RECEIVED THE JAR WITH EVERY MARK OF POLITENESS
7794-295947-0018 WE MUST MAKE A PRESENT TO THE MESSENGER INDEED SIR I'VE ALREADY BEEN PAID FOR MY TROUBLE WELL AT ANY RATE YOU MUST STOP THE NIGHT HERE THANK YOU SIR I'VE A RELATION IN THE NEXT VILLAGE WHOM I HAVE NOT SEEN FOR A LONG WHILE
7794-295947-0019 AND I WILL PASS THE NIGHT WITH HIM AND SO HE TOOK HIS LEAVE AND WENT AWAY THE PARENTS LOST NO TIME IN SENDING TO LET THE PHYSICIAN KNOW THAT THEY HAD PROCURED THE FOX'S LIVER THE NEXT DAY THE DOCTOR CAME AND COMPOUNDED A MEDICINE FOR THE PATIENT
7794-295947-0020 WHICH AT ONCE PRODUCED A GOOD EFFECT AND THERE WAS NO LITTLE JOY IN THE HOUSEHOLD AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT THREE DAYS AFTER THIS THE MAN WHOM THEY HAD COMMISSIONED TO BUY THE FOX'S LIVER CAME TO THE HOUSE SO THE GOODWIFE HURRIED OUT TO MEET HIM AND WELCOME HIM
7794-295947-0021 HOW QUICKLY YOU FULFILLED OUR WISHES AND HOW KIND OF YOU TO SEND AT ONCE THE DOCTOR PREPARED THE MEDICINE AND NOW OUR BOY CAN GET UP AND WALK ABOUT THE ROOM AND IT'S ALL OWING TO YOUR GOODNESS WAIT A BIT CRIED THE GUEST
7794-295947-0022 WHO DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THE JOY OF THE TWO PARENTS THE COMMISSION WITH WHICH YOU ENTRUSTED ME ABOUT THE FOX'S LIVER TURNED OUT TO BE A MATTER OF IMPOSSIBILITY SO I CAME TO DAY TO MAKE MY EXCUSES AND NOW I REALLY CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SO GRATEFUL TO ME FOR
7794-295947-0023 PRAY INQUIRE CAREFULLY INTO THE MATTER WELL THIS IS VERY STRANGE FOUR NIGHTS AGO A MAN OF SOME FIVE OR SIX AND THIRTY YEARS OF AGE CAME WITH A VERBAL MESSAGE FROM YOU TO THE EFFECT THAT YOU HAD SENT HIM WITH A FOX'S LIVER
7794-295947-0024 WHICH YOU HAD JUST PROCURED AND SAID THAT HE WOULD COME AND TELL US THE PRICE ANOTHER DAY WHEN WE ASKED HIM TO SPEND THE NIGHT HERE HE ANSWERED THAT HE WOULD LODGE WITH A RELATION IN THE NEXT VILLAGE AND WENT AWAY THE VISITOR WAS MORE AND MORE LOST IN AMAZEMENT AND
7794-295947-0025 LAST SPRING WHEN I WAS TAKING OUT MY CUB TO PLAY IT WAS CARRIED OFF BY SOME BOYS AND ONLY SAVED BY YOUR GOODNESS THE DESIRE TO REQUITE THIS KINDNESS PIERCED ME TO THE QUICK AT LAST WHEN CALAMITY ATTACKED YOUR HOUSE
7794-295947-0026 I THOUGHT I MIGHT BE OF USE TO YOU YOUR SON'S ILLNESS COULD NOT BE CURED WITHOUT A LIVER TAKEN FROM A LIVE FOX SO TO REPAY YOUR KINDNESS I KILLED MY CUB AND TOOK OUT ITS LIVER THEN ITS SIRE DISGUISING HIMSELF AS A MESSENGER
7794-295947-0027 BROUGHT IT TO YOUR HOUSE AND AS SHE SPOKE THE FOX SHED TEARS AND THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WISHING TO THANK HER MOVED IN BED UPON WHICH HIS WIFE AWOKE AND ASKED HIM WHAT WAS THE MATTER BUT HE TOO TO HER GREAT ASTONISHMENT
7794-295947-0028 WAS BITING THE PILLOW AND WEEPING BITTERLY WHY ARE YOU WEEPING THUS ASKED SHE AT LAST HE SAT UP IN BED AND SAID LAST SPRING WHEN I WAS OUT ON A PLEASURE EXCURSION I WAS THE MEANS OF SAVING THE LIFE OF A FOX'S CUB
7794-295947-0029 AS I TOLD YOU AT THE TIME THE OTHER DAY I TOLD MISTER SO AND SO THAT ALTHOUGH MY SON WERE TO DIE BEFORE MY EYES I WOULD NOT BE THE MEANS OF KILLING A FOX ON PURPOSE BUT ASKED HIM IN CASE HE HEARD OF ANY HUNTER KILLING A FOX
7794-295947-0030 TO BUY IT FOR ME HOW THE FOXES CAME TO HEAR OF THIS I DON'T KNOW BUT THE FOXES TO WHOM I HAD SHOWN KINDNESS KILLED THEIR OWN CUB AND TOOK OUT THE LIVER AND THE OLD DOG FOX DISGUISING HIMSELF AS A MESSENGER FROM THE PERSON TO WHOM
7794-295947-0031 WE HAD CONFIDED THE COMMISSION CAME HERE WITH IT HIS MATE HAS JUST BEEN AT MY PILLOW SIDE AND TOLD ME ALL ABOUT IT HENCE IT WAS THAT IN SPITE OF MYSELF I WAS MOVED TO TEARS
7794-295947-0032 WHEN SHE HEARD THIS THE GOODWIFE LIKEWISE WAS BLINDED BY HER TEARS AND FOR A WHILE THEY LAY LOST IN THOUGHT BUT AT LAST COMING TO THEMSELVES THEY LIGHTED THE LAMP ON THE SHELF ON WHICH THE FAMILY IDOL STOOD
7794-295947-0033 AND SPENT THE NIGHT IN RECITING PRAYERS AND PRAISES AND THE NEXT DAY THEY PUBLISHED THE MATTER TO THE HOUSEHOLD AND TO THEIR RELATIONS AND FRIENDS NOW ALTHOUGH THERE ARE INSTANCES OF MEN KILLING THEIR OWN CHILDREN TO REQUITE A FAVOUR
7794-295947-0034 THERE IS NO OTHER EXAMPLE OF FOXES HAVING DONE SUCH A THING SO THE STORY BECAME THE TALK OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY NOW THE BOY WHO HAD RECOVERED THROUGH THE EFFICACY OF THIS MEDICINE SELECTED THE PRETTIEST SPOT ON THE PREMISES
7794-295947-0035 THE SAINTS WHO ARE WORSHIPPED IN JAPAN WRITES A NATIVE AUTHORITY ARE MEN WHO IN THE REMOTE AGES WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS DEVELOPING ITSELF WERE SAGES AND BY THEIR GREAT AND VIRTUOUS DEEDS HAVING EARNED THE GRATITUDE OF FUTURE GENERATIONS
7794-295947-0036 ALL MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE SHRINES OF THE SHINTO OR INDIGENOUS RELIGION ARE CONFIDED TO THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF THE FAMILIES OF YOSHIDA AND FUSHIMI
7794-295947-0037 THE AFFAIRS OF THE BUDDHIST OR IMPORTED RELIGION ARE UNDER THE CARE OF THE FAMILY OF KANJUJI AS IT IS NECESSARY THAT THOSE WHO AS PRIESTS PERFORM THE HONOURABLE OFFICE OF SERVING THE GODS SHOULD BE PERSONS OF SOME STANDING
7794-295947-0038 A CERTAIN SMALL RANK IS PROCURED FOR THEM THROUGH THE INTERVENTION OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ABOVE NOBLE FAMILIES WHO ON THE ISSUING OF THE REQUIRED PATENT RECEIVE AS THEIR PERQUISITE A FEE WHICH ALTHOUGH INSIGNIFICANT IN ITSELF
7794-295947-0039 WHOSE PENNILESS CONDITION FORMS A GREAT CONTRAST TO THE WEALTH OF THEIR INFERIORS IN RANK THE DAIMIOS I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE ONLY CASE IN WHICH RANK CAN BE BOUGHT OR SOLD IN JAPAN
7794-295947-0040 IN CHINA ON THE CONTRARY IN SPITE OF WHAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY MEADOWS AND OTHER ADMIRERS OF THE EXAMINATION SYSTEM A MAN CAN BE WHAT HE PLEASES BY PAYING FOR IT
7794-295947-0041 ARE LOCALLY WORSHIPPED TOUCHING THE REMEDY OF THE FOX'S LIVER PRESCRIBED IN THE TALE I MAY ADD THAT THERE WOULD BE NOTHING STRANGE IN THIS TO A PERSON ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHINESE PHARMACOPOEIA WHICH THE JAPANESE LONG EXCLUSIVELY FOLLOWED
7794-295947-0042 ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOW SUCCESSFULLY STUDYING THE ART OF HEALING AS PRACTISED IN THE WEST WHEN I WAS AT PEKING I SAW A CHINESE PHYSICIAN PRESCRIBE A DECOCTION OF THREE SCORPIONS FOR A CHILD STRUCK DOWN WITH FEVER
7794-295947-0043 AND ON ANOTHER OCCASION A GROOM OF MINE SUFFERING FROM DYSENTERY WAS TREATED WITH ACUPUNCTURE OF THE TONGUE THE ART OF MEDICINE WOULD APPEAR TO BE AT THE PRESENT TIME IN CHINA MUCH IN THE STATE IN WHICH IT EXISTED IN EUROPE IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
7794-295947-0044 FOR RETENTION CAUSED BY EITHER RENAL OR VESICAL CALCULI BUT I HAVE MYSELF THOROUGHLY EXPERIENCED THE UTILITY OF AN OIL I MAKE MYSELF WHEREOF SCORPIONS FORM A VERY LARGE PORTION OF THE INGREDIENTS
7794-295947-0045 IF ONLY THE REGION OF THE HEART AND ALL THE PULSES OF THE BODY BE ANOINTED WITH IT IT WILL FREE THE PATIENTS FROM THE EFFECTS OF ALL KINDS OF POISONS TAKEN BY THE MOUTH CORROSIVE ONES EXCEPTED DECOCTIONS OF EGYPTIAN MUMMIES WERE MUCH COMMENDED
7794-295947-0046 AND OFTEN PRESCRIBED WITH DUE ACADEMICAL SOLEMNITY AND THE BONES OF THE HUMAN SKULL PULVERIZED AND ADMINISTERED WITH OIL WERE USED AS A SPECIFIC IN CASES OF RENAL CALCULUS SEE PETRI ANDREAE MATTHIOLI OPERA FIFTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
7794-295948-0000 NIGHT AND MORNING HE RECITED THE PRAYER
7794-295948-0001 ALTHOUGH THE FAME OF HIS VIRTUE DID NOT REACH FAR YET HIS NEIGHBOURS RESPECTED AND REVERED HIM
7794-295948-0002 AND WHEN HIS ROOF OR HIS WALLS FELL OUT OF REPAIR THEY WOULD MEND THEM FOR HIM SO FOR THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD HE TOOK NO THOUGHT ONE VERY COLD NIGHT WHEN HE LITTLE THOUGHT ANY ONE WAS OUTSIDE HE HEARD A VOICE CALLING
7794-295948-0003 YOUR REVERENCE YOUR REVERENCE SO HE ROSE AND WENT OUT TO SEE WHO IT WAS AND THERE HE BEHELD AN OLD BADGER STANDING ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN GREATLY ALARMED AT THE APPARITION
7794-295948-0004 BUT NOW I AM GROWING OLD AND THIS SEVERE COLD IS MORE THAN I CAN BEAR I PRAY YOU TO LET ME ENTER AND WARM MYSELF AT THE FIRE OF YOUR COTTAGE THAT I MAY LIVE THROUGH THIS BITTER NIGHT
7794-295948-0005 WENT INTO THE HUT AND SQUATTING DOWN BY THE FIRE BEGAN TO WARM ITSELF AND THE PRIEST WITH RENEWED FERVOUR RECITED HIS PRAYERS AND STRUCK HIS BELL BEFORE THE IMAGE OF BUDDHA LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM
7794-295948-0006 AFTER TWO HOURS THE BADGER TOOK ITS LEAVE WITH PROFUSE EXPRESSIONS OF THANKS AND WENT OUT AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH IT CAME EVERY NIGHT TO THE HUT AS THE BADGER WOULD COLLECT AND BRING WITH IT DRIED BRANCHES AND DEAD LEAVES FROM THE HILLS FOR FIREWOOD
7794-295948-0007 THE PRIEST AT LAST BECAME VERY FRIENDLY WITH IT AND GOT USED TO ITS COMPANY SO THAT IF EVER AS THE NIGHT WORE ON THE BADGER DID NOT ARRIVE HE USED TO MISS IT AND WONDER WHY IT DID NOT COME
7794-295948-0008 AND EVEN AFTER MY DEATH I MUST REMEMBER THEM WHAT CAN I DO TO REQUITE THEM IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH FOR PRAY TELL ME THE PRIEST SMILING AT THIS SPEECH ANSWERED
7794-295948-0009 BEING SUCH AS I AM I HAVE NO DESIRE AND NO WISHES GLAD AS I AM TO HEAR YOUR KIND INTENTIONS THERE IS NOTHING THAT I CAN ASK YOU TO DO FOR ME YOU NEED FEEL NO ANXIETY ON MY ACCOUNT AS LONG AS I LIVE WHEN THE WINTER COMES
7794-295948-0010 YOU SHALL BE WELCOME HERE THE BADGER ON HEARING THIS COULD NOT CONCEAL ITS ADMIRATION OF THE DEPTH OF THE OLD MAN'S BENEVOLENCE BUT HAVING SO MUCH TO BE GRATEFUL FOR IT FELT HURT AT NOT BEING ABLE TO REQUITE IT
7794-295948-0011 AS THIS SUBJECT WAS OFTEN RENEWED BETWEEN THEM THE PRIEST AT LAST TOUCHED BY THE GOODNESS OF THE BADGER'S HEART SAID SINCE I HAVE SHAVEN MY HEAD RENOUNCED THE WORLD AND FORSAKEN THE PLEASURES OF THIS LIFE I HAVE NO DESIRE TO GRATIFY
7794-295948-0012 YET I OWN I SHOULD LIKE TO POSSESS THREE RIYOS IN GOLD FOOD AND RAIMENT I RECEIVE BY THE FAVOUR OF THE VILLAGERS SO I TAKE NO HEED FOR THOSE THINGS WERE I TO DIE TO MORROW AND ATTAIN MY WISH OF BEING BORN AGAIN INTO THE NEXT WORLD
7794-295948-0013 THE SAME KIND FOLK HAVE PROMISED TO MEET AND BURY MY BODY THUS ALTHOUGH I HAVE NO OTHER REASON TO WISH FOR MONEY STILL IF I HAD THREE RIYOS I WOULD OFFER THEM UP AT SOME HOLY SHRINE THAT MASSES AND PRAYERS MIGHT BE SAID FOR ME
7794-295948-0014 WHEREBY I MIGHT ENTER INTO SALVATION YET I WOULD NOT GET THIS MONEY BY VIOLENT OR UNLAWFUL MEANS I ONLY THINK OF WHAT MIGHT BE IF I HAD IT SO YOU SEE SINCE YOU HAVE EXPRESSED SUCH KIND FEELINGS TOWARD ME
7794-295948-0015 I HAVE TOLD YOU WHAT IS ON MY MIND WHEN THE PRIEST HAD DONE SPEAKING THE BADGER LEANT ITS HEAD ON ONE SIDE WITH A PUZZLED AND ANXIOUS LOOK SO MUCH SO THAT THE OLD MAN WAS SORRY HE HAD EXPRESSED A WISH WHICH SEEMED TO GIVE THE BEAST TROUBLE
7794-295948-0016 AND TRIED TO RETRACT WHAT HE HAD SAID POSTHUMOUS HONOURS AFTER ALL ARE THE WISH OF ORDINARY MEN I WHO AM A PRIEST OUGHT NOT TO ENTERTAIN SUCH THOUGHTS OR TO WANT MONEY SO PRAY PAY NO ATTENTION TO WHAT I HAVE SAID
7794-295948-0017 AND THE BADGER FEIGNING ASSENT TO WHAT THE PRIEST HAD IMPRESSED UPON IT RETURNED TO THE HILLS AS USUAL FROM THAT TIME FORTH THE BADGER CAME NO MORE TO THE HUT
7794-295948-0018 THE PRIEST THOUGHT THIS VERY STRANGE BUT IMAGINED EITHER THAT THE BADGER STAYED AWAY BECAUSE IT DID NOT LIKE TO COME WITHOUT THE MONEY OR THAT IT HAD BEEN KILLED IN AN ATTEMPT TO STEAL IT AND HE BLAMED HIMSELF FOR HAVING ADDED TO HIS SINS FOR NO PURPOSE
7794-295948-0019 REPENTING WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE PERSUADED HOWEVER THAT THE BADGER MUST HAVE BEEN KILLED HE PASSED HIS TIME IN PUTTING UP PRAYERS UPON PRAYERS FOR IT AFTER THREE YEARS HAD GONE BY ONE NIGHT
7794-295948-0020 THE OLD MAN HEARD A VOICE NEAR HIS DOOR CALLING OUT YOUR REVERENCE YOUR REVERENCE AS THE VOICE WAS LIKE THAT OF THE BADGER HE JUMPED UP AS SOON AS HE HEARD IT AND RAN TO OPEN THE DOOR AND THERE SURE ENOUGH WAS THE BADGER
7794-295948-0021 IF THE MONEY WHICH YOU REQUIRED HAD BEEN FOR UNLAWFUL PURPOSES I COULD EASILY HAVE PROCURED AS MUCH AS EVER YOU MIGHT HAVE WANTED BUT WHEN I HEARD THAT IT WAS TO BE OFFERED TO A TEMPLE FOR MASSES FOR YOUR SOUL
7794-295948-0022 FUSED IT AFRESH IN THE FIRE AND AT THIS WORK I SPENT MONTHS AND DAYS AS THE BADGER FINISHED SPEAKING THE PRIEST LOOKED AT THE MONEY WHICH IT HAD PRODUCED AND SURE ENOUGH HE SAW THAT IT WAS BRIGHT AND NEW AND CLEAN
7794-295948-0023 AS HE WAS THANKING THE BADGER WITH GREAT POLITENESS AND CEREMONY THE BEAST SAID IN DOING THIS I HAVE BUT FULFILLED MY OWN WISH STILL I HOPE THAT YOU WILL TELL THIS THING TO NO MAN INDEED REPLIED THE PRIEST
7794-295948-0024 BUT I SHALL SAY THAT THE BADGER THAT GAVE ME THE MONEY HAS CEASED COMING TO MY HUT YOU NEED NOT FEAR BEING WAYLAID BUT CAN COME AS OF OLD AND SHELTER YOURSELF FROM THE COLD TO THIS THE BADGER NODDED ASSENT AND AS LONG AS THE OLD PRIEST LIVED
7794-295948-0025 IT CAME AND SPENT THE WINTER NIGHTS WITH HIM FROM THIS STORY IT IS PLAIN THAT EVEN BEASTS HAVE A SENSE OF GRATITUDE IN THIS QUALITY DOGS EXCEL ALL OTHER BEASTS
7794-295948-0026 WRITTEN IN THE ANNALS OF JAPAN
7794-295955-0000 THEN THE MIDDLE SON WENT HUNTING AND AS HE ISSUED FROM THE TOWN A HARE SPRANG OUT OF A BUSH AND THE PRINCE AFTER IT AND HITHER AND THITHER TILL THE HARE FLED INTO THE WATER MILL AND THE PRINCE AFTER IT
7794-295955-0001 BUT IT WAS NOT A HARE BUT A DRAGON WHICH WAITED FOR AND DEVOURED HIM WHEN SOME DAYS HAD ELAPSED AND THE PRINCES DID NOT RETURN EITHER OF THEM THE WHOLE COURT WAS IN SORROW
7794-295955-0002 THEN THE THIRD SON WENT HUNTING TO SEE WHETHER HE COULD NOT FIND HIS BROTHERS WHEN HE ISSUED FROM THE TOWN AGAIN UP SPRANG A HARE OUT OF A BUSH AND THE PRINCE AFTER IT AND HITHER AND THITHER TILL THE HARE FLED INTO THE WATER MILL
7794-295955-0003 BUT THE PRINCE DID NOT CHOOSE TO FOLLOW IT BUT WENT TO FIND OTHER GAME SAYING TO HIMSELF WHEN I RETURN I SHALL FIND YOU AFTER THUS HE WENT FOR A LONG TIME UP AND DOWN THE HILL BUT FOUND NOTHING AND THEN RETURNED TO THE WATER MILL
7794-295955-0004 SHE REPLIED MY SON THAT WAS NOT A HARE BUT A DRAGON IT KILLS AND THROTTLES MANY PEOPLE HEARING THIS THE PRINCE WAS SOMEWHAT DISTURBED AND SAID TO THE OLD WOMAN WHAT SHALL WE DO NOW DOUBTLESS MY TWO BROTHERS ALSO HAVE PERISHED HERE
7794-295955-0005 THE OLD WOMAN ANSWERED THEY HAVE INDEED BUT THERE'S NO HELP FOR IT GO HOME MY SON LEST YOU FOLLOW THEM THEN HE SAID TO HER DEAR OLD WOMAN DO YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW THAT YOU WILL BE GLAD TO LIBERATE YOURSELF FROM THAT PEST
7794-295955-0006 THE OLD WOMAN INTERRUPTED HIM HOW SHOULD I NOT IT CAPTURED ME TOO IN THIS WAY BUT NOW I HAVE NO MEANS OF ESCAPE THEN HE PROCEEDED LISTEN WELL TO WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY TO YOU ASK IT WHITHER IT GOES AND WHERE ITS STRENGTH IS
7794-295955-0007 WHEN THE DRAGON CAME IN THE OLD WOMAN BEGAN TO QUESTION IT WHERE IN GOD'S NAME HAVE YOU BEEN WHITHER DO YOU GO SO FAR YOU WILL NEVER TELL ME WHITHER YOU GO THE DRAGON REPLIED WELL MY DEAR OLD WOMAN I DO GO FAR
7794-295955-0008 MY STRENGTH IS A LONG WAY OFF AND YOU CANNOT GO THITHER FAR IN ANOTHER EMPIRE UNDER THE EMPEROR'S CITY IS A LAKE IN THAT LAKE IS A DRAGON AND IN THAT DRAGON A BOAR AND IN THE BOAR A PIGEON AND IN THAT IS MY STRENGTH
7794-295955-0009 TOOK A SHEPHERD'S STAFF IN HIS HAND AND WENT INTO THE WORLD AS HE WENT ON THUS FROM VILLAGE TO VILLAGE AND FROM TOWN TO TOWN AT LAST HE CAME INTO ANOTHER EMPIRE AND INTO THE IMPERIAL CITY IN A LAKE UNDER WHICH THE DRAGON WAS
7794-295955-0010 ON GOING INTO THE TOWN HE BEGAN TO INQUIRE WHO WANTED A SHEPHERD THE CITIZENS TOLD HIM THAT THE EMPEROR DID THEN HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE EMPEROR AFTER HE ANNOUNCED HIMSELF THE EMPEROR ADMITTED HIM INTO HIS PRESENCE AND ASKED HIM
7794-295955-0011 AND WHEN YOU CALL THE SHEEP OUT THEY GO THITHER AT ONCE AND SPREAD THEMSELVES ROUND THE LAKE BUT WHATEVER SHEPHERD GOES OFF THERE THAT SHEPHERD RETURNS BACK NO MORE THEREFORE MY SON I TELL YOU
7794-295955-0012 DON'T LET THE SHEEP HAVE THEIR OWN WAY AND GO WHERE THEY WILL BUT KEEP THEM WHERE YOU WILL THE PRINCE THANKED THE EMPEROR GOT HIMSELF READY AND CALLED OUT THE SHEEP TAKING WITH HIM MORE OVER TWO HOUNDS THAT COULD CATCH A BOAR IN THE OPEN COUNTRY
7794-295955-0013 AND THE HOUNDS AND BAGPIPES UNDER THE STUMP THEN TUCKED UP HIS HOSE AND SLEEVES WADED INTO THE LAKE AND BEGAN TO SHOUT DRAGON DRAGON COME OUT TO SINGLE COMBAT WITH ME TO DAY
7794-295955-0014 LET ME GO PRINCE THAT I MAY MOISTEN MY PARCHED HEAD IN THE LAKE AND TOSS YOU TO THE SKY BUT THE PRINCE REPLIED COME DRAGON DON'T TALK NONSENSE IF I HAD THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER TO KISS ME ON THE FOREHEAD I WOULD TOSS YOU STILL HIGHER
7794-295955-0015 BECAUSE HE HAD COME WHEREAS PREVIOUSLY NO SHEPHERD HAD BEEN ABLE TO COME FROM THE LAKE THE NEXT DAY THE PRINCE GOT READY AGAIN AND WENT WITH HIS SHEEP STRAIGHT TO THE LAKE BUT THE EMPEROR SENT TWO GROOMS AFTER HIM TO GO STEALTHILY AND SEE WHAT HE DID
7794-295955-0016 AND THEY PLACED THEMSELVES ON A HIGH HILL WHENCE THEY COULD HAVE A GOOD VIEW WHEN THE SHEPHERD ARRIVED HE PUT THE HOUNDS AND BAGPIPES UNDER THE STUMP AND THE FALCON UPON IT THEN TUCKED UP HIS HOSE AND SLEEVES WADED INTO THE LAKE AND SHOUTED DRAGON DRAGON
7794-295955-0017 COME OUT TO SINGLE COMBAT WITH ME THAT WE MAY MEASURE OURSELVES ONCE MORE TOGETHER UNLESS YOU ARE A WOMAN THE DRAGON REPLIED I WILL DO SO PRINCE NOW NOW ERELONG BEHOLD THE DRAGON IT WAS LARGE IT WAS TERRIBLE
7794-295955-0018 IT WAS DISGUSTING AND IT SEIZED HIM BY THE WAIST AND WRESTLED WITH HIM A SUMMER'S DAY TILL AFTERNOON BUT WHEN THE AFTERNOON HEAT CAME ON THE DRAGON SAID LET ME GO PRINCE THAT I MAY MOISTEN MY PARCHED HEAD IN THE LAKE AND MAY TOSS YOU TO THE SKY
7794-295955-0019 WHEN NIGHT APPROACHED THE PRINCE DROVE THE SHEEP AS BEFORE AND WENT HOME PLAYING THE BAGPIPES WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE TOWN THE WHOLE TOWN WAS ASTIR AND BEGAN TO WONDER BECAUSE THE SHEPHERD CAME HOME EVERY EVENING WHICH NO ONE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO BEFORE
7794-295955-0020 THOSE TWO GROOMS HAD ALREADY ARRIVED AT THE PALACE BEFORE THE PRINCE AND RELATED TO THE EMPEROR IN ORDER EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAD HEARD AND SEEN NOW WHEN THE EMPEROR SAW THAT THE SHEPHERD RETURNED HOME HE IMMEDIATELY SUMMONED HIS DAUGHTER INTO HIS PRESENCE AND TOLD HER ALL
7794-295955-0021 AND I AM YOUR ONLY DAUGHTER AND YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME IF I PERISH THEN THE EMPEROR BEGAN TO PERSUADE AND ENCOURAGE HER DON'T FEAR MY DAUGHTER YOU SEE WE HAVE HAD SO MANY CHANGES OF SHEPHERDS AND OF ALL THAT WENT OUT TO THE LAKE NOT ONE HAS RETURNED
7794-295955-0022 SO MANY PEOPLE WHEN ON THE MORROW THE DAY DAWNED AND THE SUN CAME FORTH UP ROSE THE SHEPHERD UP ROSE THE MAIDEN TOO TO BEGIN TO PREPARE FOR GOING TO THE LAKE THE SHEPHERD WAS CHEERFUL MORE CHEERFUL THAN EVER
7794-295955-0023 BUT THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER WAS SAD AND SHED TEARS THE SHEPHERD COMFORTED HER LADY SISTER I PRAY YOU DO NOT WEEP BUT DO WHAT I TELL YOU WHEN IT IS TIME RUN UP AND KISS ME AND FEAR NOT AS HE WENT AND DROVE THE SHEEP
7794-295955-0024 WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE LAKE THE SHEEP IMMEDIATELY SPREAD ROUND IT AND THE PRINCE PLACED THE FALCON ON THE STUMP AND THE HOUNDS AND BAGPIPES UNDER IT THEN TUCKED UP HIS HOSE AND SLEEVES WADED INTO THE WATER AND SHOUTED DRAGON DRAGON
7794-295955-0025 THE PRINCE REPLIED COME DRAGON DON'T TALK NONSENSE IF I HAD THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER TO KISS ME ON THE FOREHEAD I WOULD TOSS YOU MUCH HIGHER WHEN HE SAID THIS THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER RAN UP AND KISSED HIM ON THE FACE ON THE EYE AND ON THE FOREHEAD
7794-295955-0026 THEN HE SWUNG THE DRAGON AND TOSSED IT HIGH INTO THE AIR AND WHEN IT FELL TO THE GROUND IT BURST INTO PIECES BUT AS IT BURST INTO PIECES OUT OF IT SPRANG A WILD BOAR AND STARTED TO RUN AWAY BUT THE PRINCE SHOUTED TO HIS SHEPHERD DOGS
7794-295955-0027 HOLD IT DON'T LET IT GO AND THE DOGS SPRANG UP AND AFTER IT CAUGHT IT AND SOON TORE IT TO PIECES BUT OUT OF THE BOAR FLEW A PIGEON AND THE PRINCE LOOSED THE FALCON AND THE FALCON CAUGHT THE PIGEON
7794-295955-0028 CUT THESE THREE WANDS UP FROM BELOW AND STRIKE WITH THEM UPON THEIR ROOT AN IRON DOOR WILL IMMEDIATELY OPEN INTO A LARGE VAULT IN THAT VAULT ARE MANY PEOPLE OLD AND YOUNG RICH AND POOR SMALL AND GREAT WIVES AND MAIDENS
7794-295955-0029 SO THAT YOU COULD SETTLE A POPULOUS EMPIRE THERE TOO ARE YOUR BROTHERS WHEN THE PIGEON HAD TOLD HIM ALL THIS THE PRINCE IMMEDIATELY WRUNG ITS NECK THE EMPEROR HAD GONE OUT IN PERSON
7794-295955-0030 HE WASHED HIMSELF NICELY TOOK THE FALCON ON HIS SHOULDER THE HOUNDS BEHIND HIM AND THE BAGPIPES UNDER HIS ARM PLAYED AS HE WENT DROVE THE SHEEP
7794-295955-0031 WHEN THEY CAME TO THE TOWN ALL THE TOWN ASSEMBLED AS TO SEE A WONDER THE EMPEROR WHO HAD SEEN ALL HIS HEROISM FROM THE HILL CALLED HIM INTO HIS PRESENCE AND GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER WENT IMMEDIATELY TO CHURCH HAD THEM MARRIED AND HELD A WEDDING FESTIVAL FOR A WEEK
78-368-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK WHEN WE LANDED WE WALKED FOR A SHORT TIME ON THE SHORE ENJOYING THE TRANSITORY LIGHT AND THEN RETIRED TO THE INN
78-368-0001 THE WIND WHICH HAD FALLEN IN THE SOUTH NOW ROSE WITH GREAT VIOLENCE IN THE WEST THE MOON HAD REACHED HER SUMMIT IN THE HEAVENS AND WAS BEGINNING TO DESCEND
78-368-0002 THE CLOUDS SWEPT ACROSS IT SWIFTER THAN THE FLIGHT OF THE VULTURE AND DIMMED HER RAYS WHILE THE LAKE REFLECTED THE SCENE OF THE BUSY HEAVENS RENDERED STILL BUSIER BY THE RESTLESS WAVES
78-368-0003 THAT WERE BEGINNING TO RISE SUDDENLY A HEAVY STORM OF RAIN DESCENDED I HAD BEEN CALM DURING THE DAY BUT SO SOON AS NIGHT OBSCURED THE SHAPES OF OBJECTS
78-368-0004 AND NOT SHRINK FROM THE CONFLICT UNTIL MY OWN LIFE OR THAT OF MY ADVERSARY WAS EXTINGUISHED ELIZABETH OBSERVED MY AGITATION FOR SOME TIME IN TIMID AND FEARFUL SILENCE
78-368-0005 WHEN SUDDENLY I HEARD A SHRILL AND DREADFUL SCREAM IT CAME FROM THE ROOM INTO WHICH ELIZABETH HAD RETIRED AS I HEARD IT THE WHOLE TRUTH RUSHED INTO MY MIND MY ARMS DROPPED THE MOTION OF EVERY MUSCLE AND FIBRE WAS SUSPENDED
78-368-0006 I COULD FEEL THE BLOOD TRICKLING IN MY VEINS AND TINGLING IN THE EXTREMITIES OF MY LIMBS THIS STATE LASTED BUT FOR AN INSTANT
78-368-0007 GREAT GOD WHY DID I NOT THEN EXPIRE WHY AM I HERE TO RELATE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BEST HOPE
78-368-0008 SHE WAS THERE LIFELESS AND INANIMATE THROWN ACROSS THE BED HER HEAD HANGING DOWN AND HER PALE AND DISTORTED FEATURES HALF COVERED BY HER HAIR EVERYWHERE I TURN I SEE THE SAME FIGURE HER BLOODLESS ARMS AND RELAXED FORM
78-368-0009 FLUNG BY THE MURDERER ON ITS BRIDAL BIER COULD I BEHOLD THIS AND LIVE ALAS LIFE IS OBSTINATE AND CLINGS CLOSEST WHERE IT IS MOST HATED
78-368-0010 BUT THE HORROR OF OTHERS APPEARED ONLY AS A MOCKERY A SHADOW OF THE FEELINGS THAT OPPRESSED ME I ESCAPED FROM THEM
78-368-0011 TO THE ROOM WHERE LAY THE BODY OF ELIZABETH MY LOVE MY WIFE SO LATELY LIVING SO DEAR SO WORTHY SHE HAD BEEN MOVED FROM THE POSTURE IN WHICH I HAD FIRST BEHELD HER
78-368-0012 BUT THE DEADLY LANGUOR AND COLDNESS OF THE LIMBS TOLD ME THAT WHAT I NOW HELD IN MY ARMS HAD CEASED TO BE THE ELIZABETH WHOM I HAD LOVED AND CHERISHED THE MURDEROUS MARK OF THE FIEND'S GRASP WAS ON HER NECK
78-368-0013 AND I FELT A KIND OF PANIC ON SEEING THE PALE YELLOW LIGHT OF THE MOON ILLUMINATE THE CHAMBER THE SHUTTERS HAD BEEN THROWN BACK AND WITH A SENSATION OF HORROR NOT TO BE DESCRIBED
78-368-0014 I SAW AT THE OPEN WINDOW A FIGURE THE MOST HIDEOUS AND ABHORRED A GRIN WAS ON THE FACE OF THE MONSTER HE SEEMED TO JEER AS WITH HIS FIENDISH FINGER HE POINTED TOWARDS THE CORPSE OF MY WIFE
78-368-0015 BUT HE ELUDED ME LEAPED FROM HIS STATION AND RUNNING WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF LIGHTNING PLUNGED INTO THE LAKE THE REPORT OF THE PISTOL BROUGHT A CROWD INTO THE ROOM
78-368-0016 NETS WERE CAST BUT IN VAIN AFTER PASSING SEVERAL HOURS WE RETURNED HOPELESS
78-368-0017 AFTER HAVING LANDED THEY PROCEEDED TO SEARCH THE COUNTRY PARTIES GOING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AMONG THE WOODS AND VINES I ATTEMPTED TO ACCOMPANY THEM AND PROCEEDED A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE
78-368-0018 A FILM COVERED MY EYES AND MY SKIN WAS PARCHED WITH THE HEAT OF FEVER IN THIS STATE I WAS CARRIED BACK AND PLACED ON A BED HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED MY EYES WANDERED ROUND THE ROOM
78-368-0019 AS IF TO SEEK SOMETHING THAT I HAD LOST AFTER AN INTERVAL I AROSE AND AS IF BY INSTINCT CRAWLED INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE CORPSE OF MY BELOVED LAY THERE WERE WOMEN WEEPING AROUND I HUNG OVER IT
78-368-0020 AND JOINED MY SAD TEARS TO THEIRS ALL THIS TIME NO DISTINCT IDEA PRESENTED ITSELF TO MY MIND
78-368-0021 SUBJECTS REFLECTING CONFUSEDLY ON MY MISFORTUNES AND THEIR CAUSE I WAS BEWILDERED IN A CLOUD OF WONDER AND HORROR THE DEATH OF WILLIAM THE EXECUTION OF JUSTINE
78-368-0022 THE MURDER OF CLERVAL AND LASTLY OF MY WIFE EVEN AT THAT MOMENT I KNEW NOT THAT MY ONLY REMAINING FRIENDS WERE SAFE FROM THE MALIGNITY OF THE FIEND
78-368-0023 MY FATHER EVEN NOW MIGHT BE WRITHING UNDER HIS GRASP AND ERNEST MIGHT BE DEAD AT HIS FEET THIS IDEA MADE ME SHUDDER AND RECALLED ME TO ACTION
78-368-0024 THERE WERE NO HORSES TO BE PROCURED AND I MUST RETURN BY THE LAKE BUT THE WIND WAS UNFAVOURABLE AND THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS
78-368-0025 HOWEVER IT WAS HARDLY MORNING AND I MIGHT REASONABLY HOPE TO ARRIVE BY NIGHT
78-368-0026 BUT NOTHING COULD APPEAR TO ME AS IT HAD DONE THE DAY BEFORE A FIEND HAD SNATCHED FROM ME EVERY HOPE OF FUTURE HAPPINESS NO CREATURE HAD EVER BEEN SO MISERABLE AS I WAS SO FRIGHTFUL AN EVENT IS SINGLE IN THE HISTORY OF MAN
78-368-0027 BUT WHY SHOULD I DWELL UPON THE INCIDENTS THAT FOLLOWED THIS LAST OVERWHELMING EVENT MINE HAS BEEN A TALE OF HORRORS I HAVE REACHED THEIR ACME AND WHAT I MUST NOW RELATE
78-368-0028 KNOW THAT ONE BY ONE MY FRIENDS WERE SNATCHED AWAY I WAS LEFT DESOLATE MY OWN STRENGTH IS EXHAUSTED
78-368-0029 AND I MUST TELL IN A FEW WORDS WHAT REMAINS OF MY HIDEOUS NARRATION I ARRIVED AT GENEVA MY FATHER AND ERNEST YET LIVED BUT THE FORMER SUNK UNDER THE TIDINGS THAT I BORE
78-368-0030 MISERY ON HIS GREY HAIRS AND DOOMED HIM TO WASTE IN WRETCHEDNESS HE COULD NOT LIVE UNDER THE HORRORS THAT WERE ACCUMULATED AROUND HIM THE SPRINGS OF EXISTENCE SUDDENLY GAVE WAY
78-368-0031 SOMETIMES INDEED I DREAMT THAT I WANDERED
78-368-0032 MELANCHOLY FOLLOWED BUT BY DEGREES I GAINED A CLEAR CONCEPTION OF MY MISERIES AND SITUATION AND WAS THEN RELEASED FROM MY PRISON FOR THEY HAD CALLED ME MAD AND DURING MANY MONTHS AS I UNDERSTOOD A SOLITARY CELL HAD BEEN MY HABITATION
78-368-0033 THE MONSTER WHOM I HAD CREATED THE MISERABLE DAEMON WHOM I HAD SENT ABROAD INTO THE WORLD FOR MY DESTRUCTION I WAS POSSESSED BY A MADDENING RAGE WHEN I THOUGHT OF HIM
78-368-0034 AND DESIRED AND ARDENTLY PRAYED THAT I MIGHT HAVE HIM WITHIN MY GRASP TO WREAK A GREAT
78-368-0035 REVENGE ON HIS CURSED HEAD NOR DID MY HATE LONG CONFINE ITSELF TO USELESS WISHES I BEGAN TO REFLECT ON THE BEST MEANS OF SECURING HIM AND FOR THIS PURPOSE
78-368-0036 AND TOLD HIM THAT I HAD AN ACCUSATION TO MAKE THAT I KNEW THE DESTROYER OF MY FAMILY AND THAT I REQUIRED HIM TO EXERT HIS WHOLE AUTHORITY FOR THE APPREHENSION OF THE MURDERER
78-368-0037 HOWEVER WONDERFUL FORCES CONVICTION THE STORY IS TOO CONNECTED TO BE MISTAKEN FOR A DREAM AND I HAVE NO MOTIVE FOR FALSEHOOD
78-368-0038 MY MANNER AS I THUS ADDRESSED HIM WAS IMPRESSIVE
78-368-0039 AND THIS PURPOSE QUIETED MY AGONY AND FOR AN INTERVAL RECONCILED ME TO LIFE I NOW RELATED MY HISTORY BRIEFLY BUT WITH FIRMNESS AND PRECISION MARKING THE DATES WITH ACCURACY
78-368-0040 AND NEVER DEVIATING INTO INVECTIVE OR EXCLAMATION THE MAGISTRATE APPEARED AT FIRST PERFECTLY INCREDULOUS BUT AS I CONTINUED HE BECAME MORE ATTENTIVE AND INTERESTED
78-368-0041 WHEN I HAD CONCLUDED MY NARRATION I SAID THIS IS THE BEING WHOM I ACCUSE AND FOR WHOSE SEIZURE AND PUNISHMENT I CALL UPON YOU TO EXERT YOUR WHOLE POWER
78-368-0042 FROM THE EXECUTION OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON THIS OCCASION
78-368-0043 I WOULD WILLINGLY AFFORD YOU EVERY AID IN YOUR PURSUIT BUT THE CREATURE OF WHOM YOU SPEAK APPEARS TO HAVE POWERS WHICH WOULD PUT ALL MY EXERTIONS TO DEFIANCE
78-368-0044 WHO CAN FOLLOW AN ANIMAL WHICH CAN TRAVERSE THE SEA OF ICE AND INHABIT CAVES AND DENS WHERE NO MAN WOULD VENTURE TO INTRUDE
78-368-0045 SINCE THE COMMISSION OF HIS CRIMES AND NO ONE CAN CONJECTURE TO WHAT PLACE HE HAS WANDERED OR WHAT REGION HE MAY NOW INHABIT I DO NOT DOUBT THAT HE HOVERS NEAR THE SPOT WHICH I INHABIT
78-368-0046 AND IF HE HAS INDEED TAKEN REFUGE IN THE ALPS HE MAY BE HUNTED LIKE THE CHAMOIS AND DESTROYED AS A BEAST OF PREY BUT I PERCEIVE YOUR THOUGHTS YOU DO NOT CREDIT MY NARRATIVE
78-368-0047 AND DO NOT INTEND TO PURSUE MY ENEMY WITH THE PUNISHMENT WHICH IS HIS DESERT AS I SPOKE RAGE SPARKLED IN MY EYES THE MAGISTRATE WAS INTIMIDATED YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID HE
78-368-0048 I WILL EXERT MYSELF AND IF IT IS IN MY POWER TO SEIZE THE MONSTER BE ASSURED THAT HE SHALL SUFFER PUNISHMENT PROPORTIONATE TO HIS CRIMES BUT I FEAR FROM WHAT YOU
78-368-0049 HAVE YOURSELF DESCRIBED TO BE HIS PROPERTIES THAT THIS WILL PROVE IMPRACTICABLE AND THUS WHILE EVERY PROPER MEASURE IS PURSUED YOU SHOULD MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO DISAPPOINTMENT THAT CANNOT BE
78-368-0050 BUT ALL THAT I CAN SAY WILL BE OF LITTLE AVAIL MY REVENGE IS OF NO MOMENT TO YOU YET WHILE I ALLOW IT TO BE A VICE
78-368-0051 MY RAGE IS UNSPEAKABLE WHEN I REFLECT THAT THE MURDERER WHOM I HAVE TURNED LOOSE UPON SOCIETY STILL EXISTS YOU REFUSE MY JUST DEMAND I HAVE BUT ONE RESOURCE AND I DEVOTE MYSELF EITHER IN MY LIFE OR DEATH TO HIS DESTRUCTION
78-368-0052 I TREMBLED WITH EXCESS OF AGITATION AS I SAID THIS THERE WAS A FRENZY IN MY MANNER AND SOMETHING I DOUBT NOT OF THAT HAUGHTY FIERCENESS WHICH THE MARTYRS OF OLD ARE SAID TO HAVE POSSESSED
78-368-0053 HOW IGNORANT ART THOU IN THY PRIDE OF WISDOM CEASE
78-369-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR MY PRESENT SITUATION WAS ONE IN WHICH ALL VOLUNTARY THOUGHT WAS SWALLOWED UP AND LOST I WAS HURRIED AWAY BY FURY
78-369-0001 MY FIRST RESOLUTION WAS TO QUIT GENEVA FOREVER MY COUNTRY WHICH WHEN I WAS HAPPY AND BELOVED WAS DEAR TO ME NOW IN MY ADVERSITY BECAME HATEFUL
78-369-0002 I PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A SUM OF MONEY TOGETHER WITH A FEW JEWELS WHICH HAD BELONGED TO MY MOTHER AND DEPARTED AND NOW MY WANDERINGS BEGAN WHICH ARE TO CEASE BUT WITH LIFE
78-369-0003 ALL THE HARDSHIPS WHICH TRAVELLERS IN DESERTS AND BARBAROUS COUNTRIES ARE WONT TO MEET HOW I HAVE LIVED I HARDLY KNOW
78-369-0004 AND PRAYED FOR DEATH BUT REVENGE KEPT ME ALIVE I DARED NOT DIE AND LEAVE MY ADVERSARY IN BEING WHEN I QUITTED GENEVA MY FIRST LABOUR
78-369-0005 UNCERTAIN WHAT PATH I SHOULD PURSUE AS NIGHT APPROACHED I FOUND MYSELF AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CEMETERY WHERE WILLIAM ELIZABETH AND MY FATHER REPOSED I ENTERED IT
78-369-0006 AND APPROACHED THE TOMB WHICH MARKED THEIR GRAVES EVERYTHING WAS SILENT EXCEPT THE LEAVES OF THE TREES WHICH WERE GENTLY AGITATED BY THE WIND THE NIGHT WAS NEARLY DARK AND THE SCENE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOLEMN
78-369-0007 AND AFFECTING EVEN TO AN UNINTERESTED OBSERVER THE SPIRITS OF THE DEPARTED SEEMED TO FLIT AROUND
78-369-0008 THEIR MURDERER ALSO LIVED AND TO DESTROY HIM I MUST DRAG OUT MY WEARY EXISTENCE I KNELT ON THE GRASS AND KISSED THE EARTH AND WITH QUIVERING LIPS EXCLAIMED BY THE SACRED EARTH
78-369-0009 ON WHICH I KNEEL BY THE SHADES THAT WANDER NEAR ME BY THE DEEP AND ETERNAL GRIEF THAT I FEEL I SWEAR AND BY THEE O NIGHT AND THE SPIRITS THAT PRESIDE OVER THEE TO PURSUE THE DAEMON
78-369-0010 WHICH OTHERWISE SHOULD VANISH FROM MY EYES FOREVER AND I CALL ON YOU SPIRITS OF THE DEAD AND ON YOU WANDERING MINISTERS OF VENGEANCE TO AID AND CONDUCT ME IN MY WORK
78-369-0011 DEEP OF AGONY LET HIM FEEL THE DESPAIR THAT NOW TORMENTS ME I HAD BEGUN MY ADJURATION WITH SOLEMNITY AND AN AWE WHICH ALMOST ASSURED ME THAT THE SHADES OF MY MURDERED FRIENDS
78-369-0012 HEARD AND APPROVED MY DEVOTION BUT THE FURIES POSSESSED ME AS I CONCLUDED AND RAGE CHOKED MY UTTERANCE
78-369-0013 IT RANG ON MY EARS LONG AND HEAVILY THE MOUNTAINS RE ECHOED IT AND I FELT AS IF ALL HELL SURROUNDED ME WITH MOCKERY AND LAUGHTER
78-369-0014 AND THAT I WAS RESERVED FOR VENGEANCE THE LAUGHTER DIED AWAY WHEN A WELL KNOWN AND ABHORRED VOICE APPARENTLY CLOSE TO MY EAR
78-369-0015 I AM SATISFIED MISERABLE WRETCH YOU HAVE DETERMINED TO LIVE AND I AM SATISFIED I DARTED TOWARDS THE SPOT FROM WHICH THE SOUND PROCEEDED BUT THE DEVIL ELUDED MY GRASP
78-369-0016 SUDDENLY THE BROAD DISK OF THE MOON AROSE AND SHONE FULL UPON HIS GHASTLY AND DISTORTED SHAPE AS HE FLED WITH MORE THAN MORTAL SPEED I PURSUED HIM AND FOR MANY MONTHS THIS HAS BEEN MY TASK
78-369-0017 SCARED BY THIS HORRID APPARITION INFORMED ME OF HIS PATH SOMETIMES HE HIMSELF WHO FEARED THAT IF I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM I SHOULD DESPAIR AND DIE LEFT SOME MARK TO GUIDE ME
78-369-0018 THE SNOWS DESCENDED ON MY HEAD AND I SAW THE PRINT OF HIS HUGE STEP ON THE WHITE PLAIN TO YOU FIRST ENTERING ON LIFE TO WHOM CARE IS NEW AND AGONY UNKNOWN
78-369-0019 WOULD SUDDENLY EXTRICATE ME FROM SEEMINGLY INSURMOUNTABLE DIFFICULTIES SOMETIMES WHEN NATURE OVERCOME BY HUNGER SANK UNDER THE EXHAUSTION A REPAST WAS PREPARED FOR ME IN THE DESERT
78-369-0020 THAT RESTORED AND INSPIRITED ME THE FARE WAS INDEED COARSE SUCH AS THE PEASANTS OF THE COUNTRY ATE
78-369-0021 AND VANISH I FOLLOWED WHEN I COULD THE COURSES OF THE RIVERS BUT THE DAEMON GENERALLY AVOIDED THESE AS IT WAS HERE THAT THE POPULATION OF THE COUNTRY CHIEFLY COLLECTED
78-369-0022 I ALWAYS PRESENTED TO THOSE WHO HAD PROVIDED ME WITH FIRE AND UTENSILS FOR COOKING MY LIFE AS IT PASSED THUS WAS INDEED HATEFUL TO ME AND IT WAS DURING SLEEP ALONE THAT I COULD TASTE JOY O BLESSED SLEEP
78-369-0023 OFTEN WHEN MOST MISERABLE I SANK TO REPOSE AND MY DREAMS LULLED ME EVEN TO RAPTURE THE SPIRITS THAT GUARDED ME HAD PROVIDED THESE MOMENTS OR RATHER HOURS OF HAPPINESS THAT I MIGHT RETAIN STRENGTH TO FULFIL MY PILGRIMAGE
78-369-0024 DURING THE DAY I WAS SUSTAINED AND INSPIRITED BY THE HOPE OF NIGHT FOR IN SLEEP I SAW MY FRIENDS MY WIFE AND MY BELOVED COUNTRY AGAIN I SAW THE BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE OF MY FATHER
78-369-0025 HEARD THE SILVER TONES OF MY ELIZABETH'S VOICE AND BEHELD CLERVAL ENJOYING HEALTH AND YOUTH OFTEN WHEN WEARIED BY A TOILSOME MARCH I PERSUADED MYSELF THAT I WAS DREAMING UNTIL NIGHT SHOULD COME
78-369-0026 AND THAT I SHOULD THEN ENJOY REALITY IN THE ARMS OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS WHAT AGONIZING FONDNESS DID I FEEL FOR THEM
78-369-0027 AND PERSUADE MYSELF THAT THEY STILL LIVED AT SUCH MOMENTS VENGEANCE THAT BURNED WITHIN ME DIED IN MY HEART AND I PURSUED MY PATH TOWARDS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE DAEMON MORE AS A TASK ENJOINED BY HEAVEN
78-369-0028 AS THE MECHANICAL IMPULSE OF SOME POWER OF WHICH I WAS UNCONSCIOUS THAN AS THE ARDENT DESIRE OF MY SOUL WHAT HIS FEELINGS WERE WHOM I PURSUED I CANNOT KNOW
78-369-0029 THESE WORDS WERE LEGIBLE IN ONE OF THESE INSCRIPTIONS YOU LIVE AND MY POWER IS COMPLETE FOLLOW ME I SEEK THE EVERLASTING ICES OF THE NORTH
78-369-0030 WHERE YOU WILL FEEL THE MISERY OF COLD AND FROST TO WHICH I AM IMPASSIVE YOU WILL FIND NEAR THIS PLACE IF YOU FOLLOW NOT TOO TARDILY A DEAD HARE
78-369-0031 AGAIN DO I VOW VENGEANCE AGAIN DO I DEVOTE THEE MISERABLE FIEND TO TORTURE AND DEATH NEVER WILL I GIVE UP MY SEARCH UNTIL HE OR I PERISH AND THEN WITH WHAT ECSTASY
78-369-0032 THE PEASANTS WERE SHUT UP IN THEIR HOVELS AND ONLY A FEW OF THE MOST HARDY VENTURED FORTH TO SEIZE THE ANIMALS WHOM STARVATION HAD FORCED FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES TO SEEK FOR PREY THE RIVERS WERE COVERED WITH ICE
78-369-0033 AND NO FISH COULD BE PROCURED AND THUS I WAS CUT OFF FROM MY CHIEF ARTICLE OF MAINTENANCE THE TRIUMPH OF MY ENEMY INCREASED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF MY LABOURS
78-369-0034 ONE INSCRIPTION THAT HE LEFT WAS IN THESE WORDS PREPARE YOUR TOILS ONLY BEGIN WRAP YOURSELF IN FURS AND PROVIDE FOOD FOR WE SHALL SOON ENTER UPON A JOURNEY WHERE YOUR SUFFERINGS
78-369-0035 WILL SATISFY MY EVERLASTING HATRED MY COURAGE AND PERSEVERANCE WERE INVIGORATED BY THESE SCOFFING WORDS
78-369-0036 AND CALLING ON HEAVEN TO SUPPORT ME I CONTINUED WITH UNABATED FERVOUR TO TRAVERSE IMMENSE DESERTS UNTIL THE OCEAN APPEARED AT A DISTANCE AND FORMED THE UTMOST BOUNDARY OF THE HORIZON
78-369-0037 OH HOW UNLIKE IT WAS TO THE BLUE SEASONS OF THE SOUTH COVERED WITH ICE IT WAS ONLY TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM LAND BY ITS SUPERIOR WILDNESS AND RUGGEDNESS
78-369-0038 THE GREEKS WEPT FOR JOY WHEN THEY BEHELD THE MEDITERRANEAN FROM THE HILLS OF ASIA AND HAILED WITH RAPTURE THE BOUNDARY OF THEIR TOILS I DID NOT WEEP BUT I KNELT DOWN
78-369-0039 AND WITH A FULL HEART THANKED MY GUIDING SPIRIT FOR CONDUCTING ME IN SAFETY TO THE PLACE WHERE I HOPED NOTWITHSTANDING MY ADVERSARY'S GIBE TO MEET AND GRAPPLE WITH HIM
78-369-0040 SOME WEEKS BEFORE THIS PERIOD I HAD PROCURED A SLEDGE AND DOGS AND THUS TRAVERSED THE SNOWS WITH INCONCEIVABLE SPEED
78-369-0041 AND I HOPED TO INTERCEPT HIM BEFORE HE SHOULD REACH THE BEACH WITH NEW COURAGE THEREFORE I PRESSED ON AND IN TWO DAYS ARRIVED AT A WRETCHED HAMLET ON THE SEASHORE I INQUIRED OF THE INHABITANTS
78-369-0042 CONCERNING THE FIEND AND GAINED ACCURATE INFORMATION A GIGANTIC MONSTER THEY SAID HAD ARRIVED THE NIGHT BEFORE ARMED WITH A GUN AND MANY PISTOLS PUTTING TO FLIGHT THE INHABITANTS OF A SOLITARY COTTAGE
78-369-0043 THROUGH FEAR OF HIS TERRIFIC APPEARANCE HE HAD CARRIED OFF THEIR STORE OF WINTER FOOD AND PLACING IT IN A SLEDGE TO DRAW WHICH HE HAD SEIZED ON A NUMEROUS DROVE OF TRAINED DOGS
78-369-0044 HE HAD HARNESSED THEM AND THE SAME NIGHT TO THE JOY OF THE HORROR STRUCK VILLAGERS HAD PURSUED HIS JOURNEY ACROSS THE SEA IN A DIRECTION THAT LED TO NO LAND AND THEY CONJECTURED
78-369-0045 AMIDST COLD THAT FEW OF THE INHABITANTS COULD LONG ENDURE AND WHICH I THE NATIVE OF A GENIAL AND SUNNY CLIMATE COULD NOT HOPE TO SURVIVE YET AT THE IDEA THAT THE FIEND SHOULD LIVE AND BE TRIUMPHANT
78-369-0046 MY RAGE AND VENGEANCE RETURNED AND LIKE A MIGHTY TIDE OVERWHELMED EVERY OTHER FEELING AFTER A SLIGHT REPOSE DURING WHICH THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD HOVERED ROUND AND INSTIGATED ME TO TOIL AND REVENGE
78-369-0047 I DEPARTED FROM LAND I CANNOT GUESS HOW MANY DAYS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN BUT I HAVE ENDURED MISERY WHICH NOTHING BUT THE ETERNAL SENTIMENT
78-369-0048 WHICH THREATENED MY DESTRUCTION BUT AGAIN THE FROST CAME AND MADE THE PATHS OF THE SEA SECURE
78-369-0049 I SHOULD GUESS THAT I HAD PASSED THREE WEEKS IN THIS JOURNEY AND THE CONTINUAL PROTRACTION OF HOPE RETURNING BACK UPON THE HEART OFTEN WRUNG BITTER DROPS OF DESPONDENCY AND GRIEF FROM MY EYES
78-369-0050 DESPAIR HAD INDEED ALMOST SECURED HER PREY AND I SHOULD SOON HAVE SUNK BENEATH THIS MISERY ONCE AFTER THE POOR ANIMALS THAT CONVEYED ME HAD WITH INCREDIBLE TOIL
78-369-0051 GAINED THE SUMMIT OF A SLOPING ICE MOUNTAIN AND ONE SINKING UNDER HIS FATIGUE DIED I VIEWED THE EXPANSE BEFORE ME WITH ANGUISH WHEN SUDDENLY MY EYE CAUGHT A DARK SPECK UPON THE DUSKY PLAIN
78-369-0052 WHAT IT COULD BE AND UTTERED A WILD CRY OF ECSTASY WHEN I DISTINGUISHED A SLEDGE AND THE DISTORTED PROPORTIONS OF A WELL KNOWN FORM WITHIN
78-369-0053 WARM TEARS FILLED MY EYES WHICH I HASTILY WIPED AWAY THAT THEY MIGHT NOT INTERCEPT THE VIEW I HAD OF THE DAEMON BUT STILL MY SIGHT WAS DIMMED BY THE BURNING DROPS UNTIL
78-369-0054 WHEN FOR A SHORT TIME SOME ICE ROCK CONCEALED IT WITH ITS INTERVENING CRAGS I INDEED PERCEPTIBLY GAINED ON IT AND WHEN AFTER NEARLY TWO DAYS JOURNEY
78-369-0055 MY HEART BOUNDED WITHIN ME BUT NOW WHEN I APPEARED ALMOST WITHIN GRASP OF MY FOE MY HOPES WERE SUDDENLY EXTINGUISHED AND I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM MORE UTTERLY THAN I HAD EVER DONE BEFORE
78-369-0056 AS WITH THE MIGHTY SHOCK OF AN EARTHQUAKE IT SPLIT AND CRACKED WITH A TREMENDOUS AND OVERWHELMING SOUND THE WORK WAS SOON FINISHED IN A FEW MINUTES A TUMULTUOUS SEA ROLLED BETWEEN ME AND MY ENEMY
78-369-0057 AND I WAS LEFT DRIFTING ON A SCATTERED PIECE OF ICE THAT WAS CONTINUALLY LESSENING AND THUS PREPARING FOR ME A HIDEOUS DEATH
78-369-0058 SEVERAL OF MY DOGS DIED AND I MYSELF WAS ABOUT TO SINK UNDER THE ACCUMULATION OF DISTRESS WHEN I SAW YOUR VESSEL RIDING AT ANCHOR
78-369-0059 I HAD NO CONCEPTION THAT VESSELS EVER CAME SO FAR NORTH AND WAS ASTOUNDED AT THE SIGHT I QUICKLY DESTROYED PART OF MY SLEDGE TO CONSTRUCT OARS AND BY THESE MEANS WAS ENABLED WITH INFINITE FATIGUE TO MOVE MY ICE RAFT IN THE DIRECTION OF YOUR SHIP
78-369-0060 BUT YOUR DIRECTION WAS NORTHWARDS YOU TOOK ME ON BOARD WHEN MY VIGOUR WAS EXHAUSTED AND I SHOULD SOON HAVE SUNK UNDER MY MULTIPLIED HARDSHIPS INTO A DEATH WHICH I STILL DREAD FOR MY TASK IS UNFULFILLED
78-369-0061 OH WHEN WILL MY GUIDING SPIRIT IN CONDUCTING ME TO THE DAEMON ALLOW ME THE REST I SO MUCH DESIRE OR MUST I DIE AND HE YET LIVE IF I DO
78-369-0062 SWEAR TO ME WALTON THAT HE SHALL NOT ESCAPE THAT YOU WILL SEEK HIM AND SATISFY MY VENGEANCE IN HIS DEATH AND DO I DARE TO ASK OF YOU TO UNDERTAKE MY PILGRIMAGE TO ENDURE THE HARDSHIPS THAT I HAVE UNDERGONE NO
78-369-0063 SOMETIMES SEIZED WITH SUDDEN AGONY HE COULD NOT CONTINUE HIS TALE AT OTHERS HIS VOICE BROKEN YET PIERCING UTTERED WITH DIFFICULTY THE WORDS SO REPLETE WITH ANGUISH
7800-283478-0000 AS THE FRONT DOOR WAS FLUNG OPEN AND AN EXCITED MAN HURRIED DOWN THE STEPS TOWARD THE SPOT WHERE THE FOUR CHUMS STOOD BREATHING HARD AFTER THEIR RECENT EXERTIONS IT'S OLD ISAAC CHASE THE MEANEST MAN IN CENTERVILLE EXCLAIMED JERRY IN DISMAY

7800-283478-0012 THE SOONER THAT WINDOW PANE IS REPLACED THE BETTER I SHALL BE PLEASED THAT'S ENOUGH WITH THAT HE TURNED HIS BACK UPON THE GROUP AND HURRIED TO REENTER HIS HOUSE AS THOUGH FEARFUL LEST SOME OF THE SPECTATORS MIGHT ENDEAVOR TO SHAME HIM OUT OF ACCEPTING PAY FROM AN INNOCENT PARTY
7800-283478-0013 FRANK AND HIS THREE COMRADES STOOD TALKING WITH SOME OF THOSE WHO HAD GATHERED WHEN THE CRASH OF BROKEN GLASS FOLLOWED BY ANGRY WORDS IN THE HIGH PITCHED VOICE OF THE MISER DREW ATTENTION TO THE SCENE OF ACTION COME LET'S BE MOVING ALONG FELLOWS BLUFF FINALLY REMARKED
7800-283478-0014 IT GALLED HIM TO THINK THEY HAD BEEN MADE THE SCAPEGOATS BY ANDY LASHER AND HIS SET THOUGH HE KNEW ONLY TOO WELL THAT ONCE FRANK'S MIND WAS MADE UP TO PAY FOR THE BROKEN WINDOW NOTHING COULD CHANGE HIM TRUE TO HIS PROMISE FRANK FIRST OF ALL VISITED THE HARDWARE STORE

7800-283492-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN DID TEDDY KNOW WELL WOULDN'T THAT JAR YOU REMARKED BLUFF AS HE HEARD WHAT WAS CONTAINED IN THE BRIEF COMMUNICATION FROM THE LUMBERMAN TRIED TO BURN DOWN THE CAMP AT LUMBER RUN DID THEY BURST OUT JERRY
7800-283492-0001 WELL IF YOU ASKED ME MY OPINION I'D HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I DIDN'T LIKE THE LOOKS OF A FEW OF THOSE LUMBERJACKS BUT NOBODY HAS ACCUSED ANY OF THE LOGGERS OF THE CRIME REMARKED FRANK AND AT THAT THE HEAD PROJECTING FROM THE OPENING AT THE DOOR CAME A LITTLE FURTHER INTO VIEW
7800-283492-0002 WHICH WAS PRETTY GOOD EVIDENCE FRANK THOUGHT THAT THE WOUNDED BOY MUST TAKE CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THE DISCUSSION WHY WHO ELSE WOULD TRY TO TURN ON MISTER DARREL THAT WAY AND BURN HIS SHANTIES DOWN JUST WHEN WINTER IS SETTING IN ASKED BLUFF
7800-283492-0003 WE CAN ONLY GIVE A GUESS AT THAT FRANK TOLD HIM WHEW EXCLAIMED BLUFF AS HE GRASPED THE MEANING BACK OF THOSE FEW WORDS AFTER ALL I WOULDN'T PUT IT PAST HIM FRANK
7800-283492-0004 AND NOT ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ALL THESE STRANGE HINTS PORTENDED WE HAD A SPECIMEN OF HIS NASTY TEMPER YOU KNOW CONTINUED BLUFF YES TWICE NOW WE'VE HEARD HIM TEAR AROUND LIKE A BULL IN A CHINA SHOP
7800-283492-0005 OH NOW I TUMBLE TO WHAT YOU MEAN CRIED WILL WHO DID NOT OFTEN USE ANY SORT OF SLANG AND MUST THEREFORE HAVE BEEN UNUSUALLY EXCITED TO FALL INTO THE HABIT IT'S BILL BILL NACKERSON FRANK NODDED HIS HEAD
7800-283492-0006 HE'S THE ONLY PARTY AROUND THAT WE KNOW OF WHO WOULD BE MEAN ENOUGH TO TRY TO SET BUILDINGS ON FIRE JUST TO GET EVEN WITH A MAN HE DISLIKED HE OBSERVED
7800-283492-0007 YES AND DIDN'T WE HEAR HIM THREATEN TO DO SOMETHING BEFORE LONG SO AS TO HIT BACK AT MISTER DARREL JERRY WANTED TO KNOW AS IF HE HAD ALL ALONG BEEN SUSPICIOUS OF THE BIG SPORTSMAN
7800-283492-0008 WHY HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE DEATH OF SOME OF THEM WHOEVER STARTED THE FIRE DIDN'T CARE A HOOT WHETHER IT HURT OR NOT I THINK BLUFF GAVE AS HIS OPINION FRANK NOTICED THAT THE HEAD HAD DISAPPEARED FROM ALONGSIDE THE OPEN DOOR
7800-283492-0009 EVIDENTLY TEDDY HAD HEARD ENOUGH HE MUST HAVE LIMPED FROM HIS CHAIR TO THE DOORWAY UPON HEARING STRANGE VOICES OUTSIDE PERHAPS HE HAD SUSPECTED THAT THE OTHERS BROUGHT NEWS OF SOME STARTLING CHARACTER FRANK DID NOT TELL ALL OF HIS CHUMS ABOUT WHAT HE HAD SEEN
7800-283492-0010 AT THE SAME TIME IT GAVE HIM FOOD FOR MUCH SERIOUS THOUGHT I WOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED IF TEDDY KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT FIRE BUSINESS HE MENTIONED TO BLUFF A SHORT TIME LATER WHEN THEY WALKED TOGETHER DOWN TO THE SPOT WHERE THE MINK TRACKS HAD BEEN SEEN
7800-283492-0011 I SAW HIS HEAD THOUGH AFTER A BIT WHEN WE HAD TALKED MATTERS OVER HE WENT BACK TO THE FIRE AGAIN
7800-283492-0012 OH NO IT ISN'T SO BAD AS THAT HE WAS ASSURED
7800-283492-0013 THE BIG COWARD MUTTERED BLUFF CLENCHING HIS FISTS AND SHAKING HIS HEAD AS THOUGH HE WOULD LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO GET IN A BLOW AT THE BULLY MY OPINION AS FAR AS I HAVE ANY IS ABOUT LIKE THIS FRANK CONTINUED
7800-283492-0014 AFTER NACKERSON STRUCK TEDDY THE BOY HAPPENED TO OVERHEAR HIM BOASTING ABOUT WHAT HE MEANT TO DO TO THE CAMP AT LUMBER RUN OH I SEE NOW WHAT YOU MEAN FRANK
7800-283492-0015 YOU'VE GOT IT ABOUT STRAIGHT BLUFF FRANK ADMITTED OF COURSE I'M ONLY GUESSING ALL THIS REMEMBER
7800-283492-0016 HE'LL UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD KEEP A STILL TONGUE IN HIS HEAD TO SHIELD A RASCAL WHO DIDN'T HESITATE TO STRIKE HIM A COWARDLY BLOW BLUFF WAS NOT SLOW OF COMPREHENSION
7800-283492-0017 JUST AS YOU SAY TEDDY COULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE ONE TO PUT THE MATCH TO THE CAMP OVER AT LUMBER RUN WHEN NACKERSON HAD GONE AWAY PERHAPS WITH ONE OF HIS PALS WHO AGREED TO STAND BACK OF HIM THAT'S THE TIME TEDDY LIT OUT
7800-283492-0018 HE STRUCK IT PRETTY HARD AT FIRST GETTING CAUGHT IN THAT TRAP FRANK MUSED BUT WHEN YOU COME RIGHT DOWN TO FACTS I GUESS IT WAS JUST AS WELL THAT IT HAPPENED TO HIM HUH THAT'S A QUEER THING TO SAY REMONSTRATED BLUFF
7800-283492-0019 BLUFF ADMITTED AS TEDDY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE HUNG OUT AND COULDN'T FIND HIS WAY TO LUMBER RUN CAMP YOU CAN SEE THAT HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN GOING BACK TO NACKERSON OR LOSING HIMSELF IN THE BIG WOODS
7800-283492-0020 WHEW IT DOES TAKE YOU TO SEE THROUGH THINGS BLUFF DECLARED WITH A LAUGH I CAN UNDERSTAND NOW THAT IT WAS A BIG STREAK OF LUCK FOR TED WHEN HE MET WITH THAT BEAR TRAP WE NEVER KNOW WHEN WE'RE WELL OFF DO WE
7800-283492-0021 FRANK WAS ALWAYS ACCOMMODATING ESPECIALLY WHEN ANYTHING CONNECTED WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE OF NATURE WAS CONCERNED HE LOVED TO WATCH THE SMALL WOODS FOLK WHEN THEY DID NOT SUSPECT HIS PRESENCE AND LEARN MORE AND MORE OF THEIR INTERESTING HABITS
7800-283492-0022 SO THAT DAY PASSED ANOTHER AND YET A THIRD FOUND THE BOYS ENJOYING THEMSELVES TO THE LIMIT TEDDY WAS SHOWING DECIDED SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT HE COULD GET AROUND FAIRLY WELL BY NOW JERRY HAVING CUT HIM A WALKING STICK WITH A CROOK AT THE END
7800-283492-0023 HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET OVER THE NERVOUSNESS THAT HAD SHOWN ITSELF FOR A WHOLE DAY FOLLOWING HIS ADVENT IN THE NEW CAMP
7800-283492-0024 TO GO BACK TO THAT OTHER DRUDGERY WOULD HAVE BEEN TORTURE AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE TO GET AROUND HE INSISTED ON TAKING CHARGE OF THE COOKING AND THE BOYS SOON LEARNED THAT TEDDY COULD MANAGE SPLENDIDLY
7800-283492-0025 HE HAD TO BE SHOWN VERY LITTLE SO AS TO SUIT THEIR TASTES AND NONE OF THEM REGRETTED IN THE LEAST THAT THEY HAD EXTENDED A HELPING HAND TOWARD ONE IN DISTRESS A NEW LIFE WAS OPENING UP TO TEDDY
7800-283492-0026 HE HAD NEVER BEFORE COME IN CONTACT WITH SUCH AN AGREEABLE LOT OF COMPANIONS AND EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY HE TRIED TO PROVE HIMSELF GRATEFUL STILL HE DID NOT MENTION A WORD ABOUT WHAT HE MIGHT POSSIBLY KNOW OF THE DASTARDLY DEED
7800-283492-0027 WHEN SOME ONE ATTEMPTED TO FIRE THE LOGGING CAMP FRANK OFTEN SAW A WORRIED EXPRESSION COME OVER THE BOY'S FACE AND AT SUCH TIMES HE SUSPECTED THAT TEDDY WAS PUZZLING HIS BRAIN AS TO JUST WHAT HIS DUTY MIGHT BE
7800-283492-0028 AND IF HE DOES IT WILL NOT BE THE REWARD OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR INFORMATION THAT WILL MAKE HIM TELL ON THE SECOND DAY ABOUT NOON SOME OF THE BOYS WERE BUSY NEAR THE CABIN LAYING IN AN EXTRA SUPPLY OF FIREWOOD
7800-283492-0029 FRANK HAD AN IDEA THEY WOULD BE VISITED BY A BIG SNOWFALL BEFORE TWENTY FOUR HOURS HAD PASSED OF COURSE THAT'S ONLY A HAZARD FELLOWS HE TOLD BLUFF AND JERRY WHO WERE HELPING HIM ADD TO THE HANDY HEAP CLOSE TO THE DOOR OF THE CABIN
7800-283492-0030 BUT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A FEELING OF DAMPNESS IN THE AIR FOR ALL IT'S SO COLD AND THE SUN YOU NOTICE SHINES THROUGH A SORT OF HAZY CURTAIN I THINK JUST THE SAME WAY YOU DO FRANK JERRY REMARKED AND IF YOU ASKED ME TO SAY WHEN
7800-283492-0031 I'D GUESS IT WAS GOING TO STRIKE US BEFORE NIGHT WE'VE GOT OFF PRETTY FORTUNATELY SO FAR ABOUT STORMS BLUFF WENT ON AS HE THREW ANOTHER ARMFUL OF FUEL ON THE ALREADY HUGE PILE
7800-283492-0032 AND TO THINK IT HAPPENED SO NEAR OUR CAMP THAT WE MANAGED TO TOTE THE WHOLE CARCASS TO THE CABIN AND BLUFF LOOKED WITH PRIDE IN HIS EYES TOWARD A DEER THAT WAS HANGING IN REAL SPORTSMAN STYLE FROM A LIMB HEAD DOWNWARD
7800-283492-0033 IF WE DON'T GET ANOTHER WHILE WE'RE UP HERE IN THE BIG WOODS SAID JERRY SUPPRESSING THE NATURAL TWINGE OF JEALOUSY HE FELT WE OUGHT TO BE SATISFIED WITH OUR BAG AND WILL IS JUST WILD OVER THE BULLY PICTURES HE'S ACCUMULATING EVERY DAY AND NIGHT
7800-283492-0034 IT DOES SEEM AS THOUGH HE HAD MET WITH NOTHING BUT SUCCESS SO FAR FRANK ADMITTED I HOPE HE GETS THAT PRIZE THE RAILROADS ARE OFFERING SO FAR AS I CAN TELL HE HAS A DANDY COLLECTION ALREADY AND WE'VE GOT SOME TIME AHEAD OF US STILL BY THE WAY WHERE IS WILL NOW ASKED BLUFF
7800-283492-0035 ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AGO HE TOLD ME HE WAS GOING OFF TO THE PLACE WHERE WE DISCOVERED THAT COMICAL COLONY OF SQUIRRELS THAT AMUSED US YESTERDAY FRANK EXPLAINED HE HOPED BY KEEPING AS STILL AS A MOUSE TO GET A SNAP AT THEM WHEN THEY WERE CARRYING ON THAT WAY
7800-283492-0036 I THINK MYSELF IT WOULD BE A FINE WOODS PICTURE AND ADD TO HIS COLLECTION SPEAKING OF ANGELS AND YOU'RE MOST SURE TO HEAR THEIR WINGS CHUCKLED JERRY FOR THERE'S WILL COMING THIS WAY NOW AND ON THE RUN TOO ADDED FRANK
7800-283492-0037 HE LOOKS EXCITED FELLOWS I WONDER WHAT HE'S RUN ACROSS NOW WILL WAS ALMOST OUT OF BREATH THEY COULD SEE THAT HIS FACE WAS RED FROM HIS EXERTIONS BUT FILLED WITH EXCITEMENT AS WELL WHILE HIS EYES WERE AS BLUFF EXPRESSED IT
7800-283492-0038 STICKING OUT OF HIS HEAD OH WHAT A WHOPPER HE GASPED AS HE DREW NEAR THE SPOT WHERE THEY STOOD WHAT'S THAT DEMANDED FRANK WONDERING WHAT WAS COMING NOW AND SUCH TRE MENDOUS HORNS TOO CONTINUED WILL
7800-283492-0039 INVOLUNTARILY STRETCHING OUT BOTH HANDS UNTIL HE HAD THEM WIDE APART HORNS WILL BLUFF FIRED AT HIM COWS HAVE HORNS DEER CARRY ANTLERS I SAID HORNS DIDN'T I ASSERTED THE OTHER WITH DETERMINATION
7800-283492-0040 BUT I SNAPPED HIM BEFORE HE TURNED AND TROTTED OFF WHAT TROTTED OFF SHRILLED BLUFF
7800-283493-0000 THE BIG MOOSE A BULL MOOSE YOU SAY WILL ECHOED BLUFF HIS FACE LIGHTING UP WITH SUDDEN ENERGY THAT'S WHAT I MEAN REPLIED THE OTHER I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING BLUFF AND THAT I WOULDN'T KNOW A BULL MOOSE IF I SAW ONE
7800-283493-0001 BUT YOU'RE AWAY OFF IN YOUR GUESS I'VE SO LONGED TO MEET UP WITH ONE WHEN I HAD MY CAMERA WITH ME THAT I'VE BEEN PICTURING HOW HE'D LOOK AND FRANK BELIEVE ME IT WAS A BEAUT A REGULAR MONSTER HOW DID IT HAPPEN WILL ASKED FRANK
7800-283493-0002 I WAS SITTING AS STILL AS ANYTHING THE OTHER RELATED AFTER I'D GOT TWO DANDY SNAPS AT THAT FUNNY SQUIRREL FAMILY PLAYING AROUND THE TREE WHERE THEY HAVE THEIR HOME AND WAS HOPING FOR ANOTHER WHACK AT THEM TO COMPLETE THE SET WHEN ALL AT ONCE I HEARD A WHIFFING SOUND
7800-283493-0003 BUT GO ON WILL WHAT HAPPENED NEXT OH I LOOKED UP TO SEE WHAT HAD MADE THAT QUEER SOUND AND THERE HE WAS JUST STANDING AND LOOKING STRAIGHT AT ME I WAS NEARLY SCARED TO DEATH AT FIRST FOR HE LOOKED NEARLY AS BIG AS A BARN
7800-283493-0004 THEN I KNEW IT MUST BE A BULL MOOSE AND THE NEXT THING I FOUND MYSELF TAKING HIS PICTURE DID HE RUN AWAY THEN ASKED FRANK TURNED AND TROTTED OFF AS IF HE DIDN'T CARE WHETHER SCHOOL KEPT OR NOT WILL CONTINUED I EVEN HAD THE NERVE TO SHOOT HIM AGAIN AS HE WAS GOING
7800-283493-0005 AND DON'T I HOPE THAT FIRST PICTURE TURNS OUT GOOD IT WAS A REMARKABLE POSE IF ONLY THE FOCUS WAS RIGHT HE STARTED TOWARD THE CABIN DOOR AS THOUGH ANXIOUS TO DEVELOP HIS ROLL OF FILM AND DISCOVER WHAT SUCCESS HIS LABOR HAD RESULTED IN
7800-283493-0006 BLUFF CAUGHT HIM BY THE ARM WAIT JUST A MINUTE OR TWO WILL HE PLEADED TELL US SOME MORE WHERE DID ALL THIS HAPPEN FRANK KNOWS WHERE THAT SQUIRREL COLONY HAVE THEIR NEST IN THE TREE THAT'S GOT A HOLE IN THE TRUNK ABOUT THIRTY FEET UP THE OTHER REPLIED
7800-283493-0007 THAT NEAR THE CAMP IF ONLY YOU'LL HOLD YOUR HORSES UNTIL I CAN DEVELOP THIS FILM YOU SHALL SEE FOR YOURSELF WHETHER I KNOW A STAG FROM A BULL MOOSE HE WAS TOLD BY THE INDIGNANT PHOTOGRAPHER AS THE LATTER BROKE AWAY AND VANISHED INSIDE THE CABIN
7800-283493-0008 HE DID NOT FEEL THAT THEY COULD ENTIRELY DEPEND ON THE EVIDENCE OF WILL WHO MAY HAVE BEEN SO STARTLED BY THE SUDDEN COMING OF SOME ANIMAL THAT HIS IMAGINATION WORKED OVERTIME I HOPE IT WASN'T JUST A MULE THAT STRAYED AWAY FROM SOME LUMBER CAMP HE TOLD THE OTHERS
7800-283493-0009 AS THEY HURRIED OFF BUT NOT BEFORE BLUFF AND JERRY HAD DARTED INSIDE THE CABIN AND REAPPEARED CARRYING THEIR GUNS
7800-283493-0010 BLUFF ADMITTED BUT THEN WILL VOWS IT HAD HORNS TERRIBLY BIG HORNS WHICH NO MULE I EVER SAW COULD BOAST OF OWNING WELL CHANCES ARE IT WAS A BULL MOOSE FRANK ADMITTED BUT WE'LL SOON KNOW

7800-283493-0012 AND I THINK I EVEN SAW A SQUIRREL FRISK OUT OF SIGHT AS WE CAME UP YES AND HERE'S WHERE WILL MADE HIMSELF A SEAT ADDED BLUFF HE FIXED IT SO HE COULD SIT COMFORTABLY AND NOT HAVE TO FRIGHTEN THE FAMILY OF BUSHY TAILS BY MOVING
7800-283493-0013 YES SAID JERRY WHICH WOULD MAKE IT OVER THERE THAT THE THING SHOWED UP LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE GROUND AND SEE IF WILL WAS DREAMING OR NOT BEFORE HALF A MINUTE HAD PASSED FRANK WAS POINTING TO CERTAIN MARKS PLAINLY SEEN IN THE INCH AND MORE OF SNOW THAT HAD FALLEN ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
7800-283493-0014 PERHAPS AS A SORT OF FORERUNNER OF THE COMING STORM THERE YOU ARE FELLOWS HE ANNOUNCED ALL STARED HARD AT THE MONSTROUS TRACKS BLUFF EVEN GOT DOWN ON HANDS AND KNEES IN ORDER TO SEE BETTER IT WAS A MOOSE ALL RIGHT FRANK SAID JERRY
7800-283493-0015 I'M BEGINNING TO BELIEVE WILL WAS NOT SO FAR OUT OF THE WAY AFTER ALL WHEN HE SAID IT MIGHT BE THE GIANT OF ALL MAINE MOOSE BLUFF GOT UP AGAIN SHAKING HIS HEAD OH THE MEANEST LUCK THAT EVER WAS HE LAMENTED
7800-283493-0016 WHY COULDN'T I HAVE TAKEN A NOTION TO STEP OUT HERE WITH WILL TO WATCH THE WAY HE TOOK THE PICTURES OF THAT SQUIRREL FAMILY I'D HAVE HAD MY GUN ACROSS MY KNEES WITH BUCKSHOT IN EVERY SHELL OF COURSE THINK HOW
7800-283493-0017 EASY I COULD HAVE DROPPED HIM WITH SUCH A SHORT DISTANCE BETWEEN IT'S CRUEL THAT'S WHAT IT IS JERRY CLAPPED HIM ON THE SHOULDER TELL ME WHAT'S TO HINDER A COUPLE OF US GOING AFTER THE OLD CHAP BLUFF HE ASKED IN AN EAGER VOICE

7800-283493-0020 FOR UP TO NOW HE HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN MUCH OF A CHANCE TO BRING DOWN ANY BIG GAME ON THIS TRIP AND WAS SECRETLY CHAFING
7800-283493-0021 THE SOONER THE BETTER SO AS TO KEEP HIS LEAD CUT DOWN AS MUCH AS WE CAN HE WAS TOLD BY BLUFF AFTER WHICH THEY BOTH TURNED TOWARD FRANK FOR AFTER ALL IT WOULD BE FROM THIS QUARTER THAT THE SIGNAL TO START MUST EVENTUALLY COME

7800-283493-0038 WELL SO LONG BOYS AND WE ALL WISH YOU SUCCESS
7859-102518-0000 THE ROMAN AND THE PERSIAN EMPIRES DRAINED OF MEN AND MONEY AND RAVAGED FROM END TO END BY EACH OTHER'S MARAUDING ARMIES SANK DOWN IN EXHAUSTION TO HEAL THEM OF THEIR DEADLY WOUNDS
7859-102518-0001 NEVER BEFORE HAD EITHER POWER DEALT ITS NEIGHBOUR SUCH FEARFUL BLOWS AS IN THIS LAST STRUGGLE IN PREVIOUS WARS THE CONTEST HAD BEEN WAGED AROUND BORDER FORTRESSES AND THE PRIZE HAD BEEN THE CONQUEST OF SOME SMALL SLICE OF MARCHLAND
7859-102518-0002 HAD STRUCK DEADLY BLOWS AT THE HEART OF EACH OTHER'S EMPIRE AND HARRIED THE INMOST PROVINCES UP TO THE GATES OF EACH OTHER'S CAPITALS THE PERSIAN HAD TURNED THE WILD HORDES OF THE AVARS LOOSE ON THRACE
7859-102518-0003 THEY WERE BLEEDING AT EVERY PORE UTTERLY WEARIED AND EXHAUSTED AND DESIROUS OF NOTHING BUT A LONG INTERVAL OF PEACE TO RECOVER THEIR LOST STRENGTH PRECISELY AT THIS MOMENT A NEW AND TERRIBLE ENEMY FELL UPON THE TWO WAR WORN COMBATANTS
7859-102518-0004 AND DELIVERED AN ATTACK SO VEHEMENT THAT IT WAS DESTINED TO DESTROY THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF PERSIA AND TO SHEAR AWAY HALF THE PROVINCES OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE
7859-102518-0005 THE POLITICS OF ARABIA HAD UP TO THIS TIME BEEN OF LITTLE MOMENT EITHER TO ROMAN OR PERSIAN EACH OF THEM HAD ALLIES AMONG THE ARAB TRIBES AND HAD SOMETIMES SENT AN EXPEDITION OR AN EMBASSY SOUTHWARD
7859-102518-0006 INTO THE LAND BEYOND THE SYRIAN DESERT BUT NEITHER OF THEM DREAMED THAT THE SCATTERED AND DISUNITED TRIBES OF ARABIA WOULD EVER COMBINE OR BECOME A SERIOUS DANGER
7859-102518-0007 EVENTS OF WORLD WIDE IMPORTANCE HAD BEEN TAKING PLACE IN THE ARABIAN PENINSULA FOR THE FIRST AND LAST TIME IN HISTORY THERE HAD ARISEN AMONG THE ARABS ONE OF THOSE WORLD COMPELLING MINDS THAT ARE DESTINED TO TURN ASIDE THE CURRENT OF EVENTS
7859-102518-0008 INTO NEW CHANNELS AND CHANGE THE FACE OF WHOLE CONTINENTS MAHOMET THAT STRANGEST OF MORAL ENIGMAS PROPHET AND SEER FANATIC AND IMPOSTOR WAS DEVELOPING HIS CAREER ALL THROUGH THE YEARS OF THE PERSIAN WAR
7859-102518-0009 BY AN EXTRAORDINARY MIXTURE OF GENUINE ENTHUSIASM AND VULGAR CUNNING OF SELF DECEPTION AND DELIBERATE IMPOSTURE OF BENEVOLENCE AND CRUELTY OF AUSTERITY AND LICENCE HE HAD WORKED HIMSELF AND HIS CREED TO THE FRONT
7859-102518-0010 THE TURBULENT POLYTHEISTS OF ARABIA HAD BY HIM BEEN CONVERTED INTO A COMPACT BAND OF FANATICS BURNING TO CARRY ALL OVER THE WORLD BY THE FORCE OF THEIR SWORDS THEIR NEW WAR CRY THAT
7859-102518-0011 GOD WAS GOD AND MAHOMET HIS PROPHET
7859-102518-0012 BIDDING THEM EMBRACE ISLAM THE PERSIAN REPLIED WITH THE THREAT THAT HE WOULD PUT THE PROPHET IN CHAINS WHEN HE HAD LEISURE THE ROMAN MADE NO DIRECT REPLY BUT SENT MAHOMET SOME SMALL PRESENTS
7859-102518-0013 NEGLECTING THE THEOLOGICAL BENT OF HIS MESSAGE AND ONLY THINKING OF ENLISTING A POSSIBLE POLITICAL ALLY BOTH ANSWERS WERE REGARDED AS EQUALLY UNSATISFACTORY BY THE PROPHET AND HE DOOMED THE TWO EMPIRES TO A SIMILAR DESTRUCTION
7859-102518-0014 IS NOT A THING TO BE DESPISED
7859-102518-0015 NOR SCOFF WITH GIBBON AT THE FEEBLENESS OF THE TROOPS WHO WERE ROUTED BY THEM IF THE SOLDIERS OF QUEEN VICTORIA ARMED WITH MODERN RIFLES AND ARTILLERY FOUND THE FANATICAL ARAB A FORMIDABLE FOE LET US NOT BLAME THE SOLDIERS OF HERACLIUS WHO FACED THE SAME ENEMY
7859-102518-0016 IN THE EARLY ENGAGEMENTS BETWEEN THE EAST ROMANS AND THE SARACENS THE SUPERIOR DISCIPLINE AND MORE REGULAR ARMS OF THE ONE
7859-102518-0017 WERE NOT A SUFFICIENT COUNTERPOISE TO PUT AGAINST THE MAD RECKLESSNESS OF THE OTHER THE MOSLEM WANTED TO GET KILLED THAT HE MIGHT REAP THE FRUITS OF MARTYRDOM IN THE OTHER WORLD AND CARED NOT HOW HE DIED IF HE HAD FIRST SLAIN AN ENEMY
7859-102518-0018 THE ROMAN FOUGHT WELL ENOUGH BUT HE DID NOT LIKE HIS ADVERSARY YEARN TO BECOME A MARTYR AND THE ODDS WERE ON THE MAN WHO HELD HIS LIFE THE CHEAPEST
7859-102518-0019 AND TO DO SO HAD NOT ONLY DRAINED THE TREASURY BUT IMPOSED SOME NEW AND UNWISE TAXES ON THE HARASSED PROVINCIALS AND DISBANDED MANY OF HIS VETERANS FOR THE SAKE OF ECONOMY
7859-102518-0020 SYRIA AND EGYPT AFTER SPENDING TWELVE AND TEN YEARS RESPECTIVELY UNDER THE PERSIAN YOKE HAD NOT YET GOT BACK INTO THEIR OLD ORGANIZATION
7859-102518-0021 BOTH COUNTRIES WERE MUCH DISTRACTED WITH RELIGIOUS TROUBLES THE HERETICAL SECTS OF THE MONOPHYSITES AND JACOBITES WHO SWARMED WITHIN THEIR BOUNDARIES HAD LIFTED UP THEIR HEADS UNDER THE PERSIAN RULE BEING RELIEVED FROM THE GOVERNMENTAL REPRESSION THAT HAD HITHERTO BEEN THEIR LOT
7859-102518-0022 THEY SEEM TO HAVE CONSTITUTED AN ACTUAL MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION AND BITTERLY RESENTED THE ENDEAVOURS OF HERACLIUS TO ENFORCE ORTHODOXY IN THE RECONQUERED PROVINCES THEIR DISCONTENT WAS SO BITTER
7859-102518-0023 THE DETAILS OF THE ARAB CONQUEST OF SYRIA HAVE NOT BEEN PRESERVED BY THE EAST ROMAN HISTORIANS WHO SEEM TO HAVE HATED THE IDEA OF RECORDING THE DISASTERS OF CHRISTENDOM THE MOSLEMS ON THE OTHER HAND HAD NOT YET COMMENCED TO WRITE AND ERE HISTORIANS AROSE AMONG THEM
7859-102518-0024 THE TALE OF THE INVASION HAD BEEN INTERTWINED WITH A WHOLE CYCLE OF ROMANTIC LEGENDS FITTER FOR THE ARABIAN NIGHTS
7859-102518-0025 GABATHA IN ITURAEA THOROUGHLY ROUSED BY THIS DISASTER HERACLIUS SET ALL THE LEGIONS OF THE EAST MARCHING AND SIXTY THOUSAND MEN CROSSED THE JORDAN AND ADVANCED TO RECOVER BOSTRA
7859-102518-0026 THE ARABS MET THEM AT THE FORDS OF THE HIEROMAX AN EASTERN TRIBUTARY OF THE JORDAN AND A FIERCE BATTLE RAGED ALL DAY THE ROMANS DROVE THE ENEMY BACK TO THE VERY GATES OF THEIR CAMP BUT A LAST CHARGE HEADED BY THE FIERCE WARRIOR KHALED
7859-102518-0027 BROKE THEIR FIRM ARRAY WHEN A VICTORY SEEMED ALMOST ASSURED ALL THE MAILED HORSEMEN OF HERACLIUS
7859-102518-0028 PARADISE IS BEFORE YOU THE DEVIL AND HELL FIRE BEHIND THE FANATICAL ORIENTALS THREW THEMSELVES ON REGIMENT AFTER REGIMENT AND DROVE IT OFF THE FIELD ALL SYRIA EAST OF JORDAN WAS LOST IN THIS FATAL BATTLE DAMASCUS ITS GREAT STRONGHOLD
7859-102518-0029 MOST OF ITS POPULATION WERE MASSACRED
7859-102518-0030 AND WAS BEGINNING TO FAIL IN HEALTH HE COULD DO NOTHING EMESA AND HELIOPOLIS WERE SACKED BEFORE HIS EYES AND AFTER AN INGLORIOUS CAMPAIGN HE HURRIED TO JERUSALEM
7859-102518-0031 TOOK THE TRUE CROSS FROM ITS SANCTUARY WHERE HE HAD REPLACED IT IN TRIUMPH FIVE YEARS BEFORE AND RETIRED TO CONSTANTINOPLE
7859-102518-0032 HARDLY HAD HE REACHED IT WHEN THE NEWS ARRIVED THAT HIS DISCONTENTED AND DEMORALIZED TROOPS HAD PROCLAIMED A REBEL EMPEROR THOUGH THE ENEMY WAS BEFORE THEM
7859-102518-0033 AND THE AGED OMAR CAME OVER THE DESERT PROUD TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE CITY WHICH MAHOMET HAD RECKONED THE HOLIEST SITE ON EARTH SAVE MECCA ALONE THE PATRIARCH SOPHRONIUS WAS COMMANDED TO GUIDE THE CONQUEROR AROUND THE CITY
7859-102518-0034 AND WHEN HE SAW THE RUDE ARAB STANDING BY THE ALTAR OF THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE CRIED ALOUD NOW IS THE ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION WHICH WAS SPOKEN OF BY DANIEL THE PROPHET TRULY IN THE HOLY PLACE
7859-102519-0000 WAS A SOVEREIGN OF A DIFFERENT TYPE FROM ANY EMPEROR THAT WE HAVE YET ENCOUNTERED IN THE ANNALS OF THE EASTERN EMPIRE HE WAS A BOLD RECKLESS CALLOUS AND SELFISH YOUNG MAN
7859-102519-0001 HE WAS IN SHORT OF THE STUFF OF WHICH TYRANTS ARE MADE JUSTINIAN WAS BUT SEVENTEEN WHEN HE CAME TO THE THRONE BUT HE SOON SHOWED THAT HE INTENDED TO RULE THE EMPIRE AFTER HIS OWN GOOD PLEASURE
7859-102519-0002 LONG BEFORE HE HAD BEGUN TO LEARN THE LESSONS OF STATE CRAFT ERE HE HAD REACHED HIS TWENTY FIRST YEAR JUSTINIAN HAD PLUNGED INTO WAR WITH THE BULGARIANS HE ATTACKED THEM SUDDENLY INFLICTED SEVERAL DEFEATS ON THEIR KING
7859-102519-0003 AND TOOK NO LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND PRISONERS WHOM HE SENT OVER TO ASIA AND FORCED TO ENLIST IN THE ARMY OF ARMENIA
7859-102519-0004 BEARING VERSES OF THE KORAN JUSTINIAN REFUSED TO RECEIVE THEM AND DECLARED WAR HIS SECOND VENTURE IN THE FIELD WAS DISASTROUS HIS UNWILLING RECRUITS FROM BULGARIA DESERTED TO THE ENEMY WHEN HE MET THE SARACENS AT SEBASTOPOLIS
7859-102519-0005 AND THE ROMAN ARMY WAS ROUTED WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER THE TWO SUBSEQUENT CAMPAIGNS WERE EQUALLY UNSUCCESSFUL
7859-102519-0006 JUSTINIAN'S WARS DEPLETED HIS TREASURY YET HE PERSISTED IN PLUNGING INTO EXPENSIVE SCHEMES OF BUILDING AT THE SAME TIME AND WAS DRIVEN TO COLLECT MONEY BY THE MOST RECKLESS EXTORTION HE EMPLOYED TWO UNSCRUPULOUS MINISTERS THEODOTUS
7859-102519-0007 THE ACCOUNTANT GENERAL AN EX ABBOT WHO HAD DESERTED HIS MONASTERY AND THE EUNUCH STEPHANUS THE KEEPER OF THE PRIVY PURSE THESE MEN WERE TO JUSTINIAN WHAT RALPH FLAMBARD WAS TO WILLIAM RUFUS
7859-102519-0008 THEY RAISED HIM FUNDS BY FLAGRANT EXTORTION AND ILLEGAL STRETCHING OF THE LAW BOTH WERE VIOLENT AND CRUEL THEODOTUS IS SAID TO HAVE HUNG RECALCITRANT TAX PAYERS UP BY ROPES ABOVE SMOKY FIRES TILL THEY WERE NEARLY STIFLED
7859-102519-0009 STEPHANUS THRASHED AND STONED EVERY ONE WHO FELL INTO HIS HANDS HE IS REPORTED TO HAVE ACTUALLY ADMINISTERED A WHIPPING TO THE EMPRESS DOWAGER DURING THE ABSENCE OF HER SON AND JUSTINIAN DID NOT PUNISH HIM WHEN HE RETURNED
7859-102519-0010 WHILE THE EMPEROR'S FINANCIAL EXPEDIENTS WERE MAKING HIM HATED BY THE MONEYED CLASSES HE WAS RENDERING HIMSELF NO LESS UNPOPULAR IN THE ARMY
7859-102519-0011 HE BEGAN TO EXECUTE OR IMPRISON HIS OFFICERS AND TO DECIMATE HIS BEATEN TROOPS TO BE EMPLOYED BY HIM IN HIGH COMMAND WAS ALMOST AS DANGEROUS AS IT WAS TO BE APPOINTED A GENERAL IN CHIEF DURING THE DICTATORSHIP OF ROBESPIERRE
7859-102519-0012 GENERAL OF THE THEME OF HELLAS WAS ABOUT TO SET OUT TO ASSUME HIS COMMAND AS HE PARTED FROM HIS FRIENDS HE EXCLAIMED THAT HIS DAYS WERE NUMBERED AND THAT HE SHOULD BE EXPECTING THE ORDER FOR HIS EXECUTION TO ARRIVE AT ANY MOMENT THEN A CERTAIN MONK NAMED PAUL STOOD FORTH
7859-102519-0013 AND BADE HIM SAVE HIMSELF BY A BOLD STROKE IF HE WOULD AIM A BLOW AT JUSTINIAN HE WOULD FIND THE PEOPLE AND THE ARMY READY TO FOLLOW HIM
7859-102519-0014 AND RUSHING TO THE STATE PRISON AT THE HEAD OF A FEW FRIENDS BROKE IT OPEN AND LIBERATED SOME HUNDREDS OF POLITICAL PRISONERS A MOB JOINED HIM HE SEIZED THE CATHEDRAL OF SAINT SOPHIA
7859-102519-0015 NO ONE WOULD FIGHT FOR JUSTINIAN WHO WAS CAUGHT AND BROUGHT BEFORE THE REBEL LEADER IN COMPANY WITH HIS TWO ODIOUS MINISTERS
7859-102519-0016 AND BANISHED HIM TO CHERSON THEODOTUS AND STEPHANUS HE HANDED OVER TO THE MOB WHO DRAGGED THEM ROUND THE CITY AND BURNT THEM ALIVE
7859-102519-0017 THE NEW EMPEROR WAS NOT A MAN OF CAPACITY AND HAD BEEN DRIVEN INTO REBELLION BY HIS FEARS RATHER THAN HIS AMBITION HE HELD THE THRONE BARELY THREE YEARS AMID CONSTANT REVOLTS AT HOME AND DEFEATS ABROAD
7859-102519-0018 THE ASIATIC FRONTIER WAS RAVAGED BY THE ARMIES OF ABDALMALIK AND AT THE SAME TIME A GREAT DISASTER BEFEL THE WESTERN HALF OF THE EMPIRE
7859-102519-0019 WHERE THE ROMANS HAD STILL MAINTAINED THEMSELVES BY HARD FIGHTING
7859-102519-0020 HIS TROOPS GAINED SEVERAL VICTORIES OVER THE SARACENS
7859-102519-0021 AND EVEN INVADED NORTHERN SYRIA
7859-102519-0022 THE PEOPLE AND ARMY WERE OUT OF HAND THE EPHEMERAL EMPEROR COULD COUNT ON NO LOYALTY AND ANY SHOCK WAS SUFFICIENT TO UPSET HIS PRECARIOUS THRONE WE MUST NOW TURN TO THE BANISHED JUSTINIAN
7859-102519-0023 WHO HAD BEEN SENT INTO EXILE WITH HIS NOSE MUTILATED HE HAD BEEN TRANSPORTED TO CHERSON THE GREEK TOWN IN THE CRIMEA CLOSE TO THE MODERN SEBASTOPOL WHICH FORMED THE NORTHERNMOST OUTPOST OF CIVILIZATION
7859-102519-0024 AND ENJOYED MUNICIPAL LIBERTY UNDER THE SUZERAINTY OF THE EMPIRE JUSTINIAN DISPLAYED IN HIS DAY OF ADVERSITY A DEGREE OF CAPACITY WHICH ASTONISHED HIS CONTEMPORARIES HE FLED FROM CHERSON AND TOOK REFUGE WITH THE KHAN OF THE KHAZARS
7859-102519-0025 THE TARTAR TRIBE WHO DWELT EAST OF THE SEA OF AZOF WITH THIS PRINCE THE EXILE SO INGRATIATED HIMSELF THAT HE RECEIVED IN MARRIAGE HIS SISTER WHO WAS BAPTIZED AND CHRISTENED THEODORA
7859-102519-0026 TO INDUCE HIM TO SURRENDER JUSTINIAN AND THE TREACHEROUS BARBARIAN DETERMINED TO ACCEPT THE BRIBE AND SENT SECRET ORDERS TO TWO OF HIS OFFICERS
7859-102519-0027 THE EMPEROR LEARNT OF THE PLOT THROUGH HIS WIFE AND SAVED HIMSELF BY THE BOLD EXPEDIENT OF GOING AT ONCE TO ONE OF THE TWO KHAZAR CHIEFS AND ASKING FOR A SECRET INTERVIEW WHEN THEY WERE ALONE HE FELL ON HIM AND STRANGLED HIM
7859-102519-0028 AND THEN CALLING ON THE SECOND KHAZAR SERVED HIM IN THE SAME FASHION BEFORE THE KHAN'S ORDERS HAD BEEN DIVULGED TO ANY ONE THIS GAVE HIM TIME TO ESCAPE AND HE FLED IN A FISHING BOAT OUT INTO THE EUXINE WITH A FEW FRIENDS AND SERVANTS WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM INTO EXILE
7859-102519-0029 WHILE THEY WERE OUT AT SEA A STORM AROSE AND THE BOAT BEGAN TO FILL ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS CRIED TO JUSTINIAN TO MAKE HIS PEACE WITH GOD AND PARDON HIS ENEMIES ERE HE DIED BUT THE EMPEROR'S STERN SOUL WAS NOT BENT BY THE TEMPEST
7859-102519-0030 MAY GOD DROWN ME HERE HE ANSWERED
7859-102519-0031 THE BOAT WEATHERED THE STORM AND JUSTINIAN SURVIVED TO CARRY OUT HIS CRUEL OATH HE CAME ASHORE IN THE LAND OF THE BULGARIANS AND SOON WON FAVOUR WITH THEIR KING TERBEL WHO WANTED A GOOD EXCUSE FOR INVADING THE EMPIRE
7859-102519-0032 AND FOUND IT IN THE PRETENCE OF SUPPORTING THE EXILED MONARCH WITH A BULGARIAN ARMY AT HIS BACK JUSTINIAN APPEARED BEFORE CONSTANTINOPLE
7859-102519-0033 THERE WAS NO FIGHTING FOR THE ADHERENTS OF TIBERIUS WERE AS UNREADY TO STRIKE A BLOW FOR THEIR MASTER
7859-102519-0034 SO JUSTINIAN RECOVERED HIS THRONE WITHOUT FIGHTING FOR THE PEOPLE HAD BY THIS TIME HALF FORGOTTEN HIS TYRANNY AND REGRETTED THE RULE OF THE HOUSE OF HERACLIUS BUT THEY WERE SOON TO FIND OUT THAT THEY HAD ERRED IN SUBMITTING TO THE EXILE
7859-102519-0035 AND SHOULD HAVE RESISTED HIM AT ALL HAZARDS JUSTINIAN CAME BACK IN A RELENTLESS MOOD BENT ON NOTHING BUT REVENGING HIS MUTILATED NOSE AND HIS TEN YEARS OF EXILE HIS FIRST ACT WAS TO SEND FOR THE TWO USURPERS WHO HAD SAT ON HIS THRONE
7859-102519-0036 AS HE TRIED TO FLEE INTO ASIA JUSTINIAN HAD THEM LED ROUND THE CITY IN CHAINS AND THEN BOUND THEM SIDE BY SIDE BEFORE HIS THRONE IN THE CATHISMA THE IMPERIAL BOX AT THE HIPPODROME
7859-102519-0037 THERE HE SAT IN STATE USING THEIR PROSTRATE BODIES AS A FOOTSTOOL WHILE HIS ADHERENTS CHANTED THE VERSE FROM THE NINETY FIRST PSALM THOU SHALT TREAD ON THE LION AND ASP THE YOUNG LION AND DRAGON SHALT THOU TRAMPLE UNDER THY FEET
7859-102519-0038 AND APSIMARUS AFTER THIS STRANGE EXHIBITION THE TWO EX EMPERORS WERE BEHEADED THEIR EXECUTION BEGAN A REIGN OF TERROR FOR JUSTINIAN HAD HIS OATH TO KEEP AND WAS SET ON WREAKING VENGEANCE ON EVERY ONE WHO HAD BEEN CONCERNED IN HIS DEPOSITION
7859-102519-0039 AND PUT OUT THE EYES OF THE PATRIARCH WHO HAD CROWNED HIM THEN HE SET TO WORK TO HUNT OUT MEANER VICTIMS MANY PROMINENT CITIZENS OF CONSTANTINOPLE WERE SOWN UP IN SACKS AND DROWNED IN THE BOSPHORUS SOLDIERS WERE PICKED OUT BY THE DOZEN AND BEHEADED
7859-102519-0040 A SPECIAL EXPEDITION WAS SENT BY SEA TO SACK CHERSON THE CITY OF THE EMPEROR'S EXILE BECAUSE HE HAD A GRUDGE AGAINST ITS CITIZENS THE CHIEF MEN WERE CAUGHT AND SENT TO THE CAPITAL WHERE JUSTINIAN HAD THEM BOUND TO SPITS AND ROASTED
7859-102519-0041 THESE ATROCITIES WERE MERE SAMPLES OF THE GENERAL CONDUCT OF JUSTINIAN IN A FEW YEARS HE HAD MADE HIMSELF SO MUCH DETESTED THAT IT MIGHT BE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN COMPARATIVELY POPULAR IN THE DAYS OF HIS FIRST REIGN
7859-102519-0042 THE ARMY OF THE TYRANT LAID DOWN THEIR ARMS WHEN PHILIPPICUS APPROACHED AND HE WAS LED FORTH AND BEHEADED WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY AN END TOO GOOD FOR SUCH A MONSTER THE CONQUEROR ALSO SOUGHT OUT AND SLEW HIS LITTLE SON TIBERIUS
7859-102519-0043 WHOM THE SISTER OF THE KHAN OF THE KHAZARS HAD BORNE TO HIM DURING HIS EXILE SO ENDED THE HOUSE OF HERACLIUS AFTER IT HAD SAT FOR FIVE GENERATIONS AND ONE HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS ON THE THRONE OF CONSTANTINOPLE
7859-102519-0044 THE SIX YEARS WHICH FOLLOWED WERE PURELY ANARCHICAL JUSTINIAN'S WILD AND WICKED FREAKS HAD COMPLETED THE DEMORALIZATION WHICH HAD ALREADY SET IN BEFORE HIS RESTORATION EVERYTHING IN THE ARMY AND THE STATE WAS COMPLETELY DISORGANIZED AND OUT OF GEAR
7859-102519-0045 IT REQUIRED A HERO TO RESTORE THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT AND EVOLVE ORDER OUT OF CHAOS BUT THE HERO WAS NOT AT ONCE FORTHCOMING AND THE CONFUSION WENT ON INCREASING
7859-102519-0046 TO REPLACE JUSTINIAN BY PHILIPPICUS WAS ONLY TO SUBSTITUTE KING LOG FOR KING STORK THE NEW EMPEROR WAS A MERE MAN OF PLEASURE AND SPENT HIS TIME IN PERSONAL ENJOYMENT LETTING AFFAIRS OF STATE SLIDE ON AS BEST THEY MIGHT
7859-102519-0047 IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS HE WAS UPSET BY A CONSPIRACY
7859-102519-0048 PHILIPPICUS WAS BLINDED AND COMPELLED TO EXCHANGE THE PLEASURES OF THE PALACE FOR THE RIGOURS OF A MONASTERY BUT THE COURT INTRIGUE WHICH DETHRONED PHILIPPICUS DID NOT PLEASE THE ARMY
7859-102519-0049 WHO GAVE THE IMPERIAL CROWN TO THEODOSIUS OF ADRAMMYTIUM A RESPECTABLE BUT OBSCURE COMMISSIONER OF TAXES MORE MERCIFUL THAN ANY OF HIS EPHEMERAL PREDECESSORS
7859-102519-0050 AFTER COMPELLING HIM TO TAKE HOLY ORDERS MEANWHILE THE ORGANIZATION OF THE EMPIRE WAS VISIBLY BREAKING UP THE AFFAIRS BOTH OF THE REALM AND THE CITY WERE NEGLECTED AND DECAYING CIVIL EDUCATION WAS DISAPPEARING AND MILITARY DISCIPLINE DISSOLVED
7859-102519-0051 AND EVERY YEAR THEIR RAVAGES PENETRATED FURTHER INLAND
7859-102519-0052 WITH THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF LAYING SIEGE TO CONSTANTINOPLE NO ONE HINDERED HIM FOR THE ARMY RAISED TO SERVE AGAINST HIM
7859-102519-0053 THEY HAD PENETRATED INTO PHRYGIA
7859-102519-0054 WITH EVERY EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS WHEN AT LAST THERE APPEARED THE MAN WHO WAS DESTINED TO SAVE THE EAST ROMAN EMPIRE FROM A PREMATURE DISMEMBERMENT
7859-102519-0055 WHO HAD MADE A GREAT REPUTATION AMID THE FEARFUL DISASTERS OF THE LAST TEN YEARS HE WAS NOW GENERAL OF THE ANATOLIC THEME THE PROVINCE WHICH INCLUDED THE OLD CAPPADOCIA AND LYCAONIA AFTER INDUCING THE SARACENS MORE BY CRAFT THAN FORCE
7859-102519-0056 TO RAISE THE SIEGE OF AMORIUM LEO DISOWNED HIS ALLEGIANCE TO THE INCAPABLE THEODOSIUS AND MARCHED TOWARD THE BOSPHORUS THE UNFORTUNATE EMPEROR WHO HAD NOT COVETED THE THRONE HE OCCUPIED NOR MUCH DESIRED TO RETAIN IT
7859-102521-0000 THE ICONOCLASTS
7859-102521-0001 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL FOR HIS REPUTATION IN HISTORY UNHAPPILY FOR HIMSELF THOUGH HAPPILY ENOUGH FOR THE EAST ROMAN REALM HE SURVIVED YET TWENTY YEARS TO CARRY THROUGH A SERIES OF MEASURES WHICH WERE IN HIS EYES NOT LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE REPULSE OF THE MOSLEMS FROM HIS CAPITAL
7859-102521-0002 HISTORIANS HAVE GIVEN TO THE SCHEME OF REFORM WHICH HE TOOK IN HAND THE NAME OF THE ICONOCLASTIC MOVEMENT BECAUSE OF THE OPPOSITION TO THE WORSHIP OF IMAGES WHICH FORMED ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT FEATURES OF HIS ACTION
7859-102521-0003 FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS THE EMPIRE HAD BEEN DECLINING IN CULTURE AND CIVILIZATION LITERATURE AND ART SEEMED LIKELY TO PERISH IN THE NEVER ENDING CLASH OF ARMS THE OLD ROMAN JURISPRUDENCE WAS BEING FORGOTTEN
7859-102521-0004 THE RACE OF EDUCATED CIVIL SERVANTS WAS SHOWING SIGNS OF EXTINCTION THE GOVERNORS OF PROVINCES WERE NOW WITHOUT EXCEPTION ROUGH SOLDIERS NOT MEMBERS OF THAT OLD BUREAUCRACY WHOSE ROMAN TRADITIONS HAD SO LONG KEPT THE EMPIRE TOGETHER
7859-102521-0005 NOT LEAST AMONG THE SIGNS OF A DECAYING CIVILIZATION WERE THE GROSS SUPERSTITIONS WHICH HAD GROWN UP OF LATE IN THE RELIGIOUS WORLD
7859-102521-0006 UNNOTICED AND UNGUARDED AGAINST BY THEOLOGIANS WHO DEVOTED ALL THEIR ENERGIES TO THE BARREN MONOTHELITE AND MONOPHYSITE CONTROVERSIES IMAGE WORSHIP AND RELIC WORSHIP IN PARTICULAR HAD DEVELOPED WITH STRANGE RAPIDITY AND ASSUMED THE SHAPE OF MERE FETISHISM
7859-102521-0007 SLAVS AND BULGARIANS ALL OF WHOM HE BEAT BACK WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER ON THE NUMEROUS OCCASIONS WHEN THEY INVADED THE EMPIRE BUT IN THE MINDS BOTH OF CONSTANTINE HIMSELF AND OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES HIS DEALINGS WITH THINGS RELIGIOUS WERE THE MAIN FEATURE OF HIS REIGN
7859-102521-0008 AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS BEGUN TO CLOSE MONASTERIES WHOLESALE WE ARE TOLD THAT HE COMPELLED MANY OF THEIR INMATES TO MARRY BY FORCE OF THREATS OTHERS WERE EXILED TO CYPRUS BY THE HUNDRED NOT A FEW WERE FLOGGED AND IMPRISONED
7859-102521-0009 THESE UNWISE MEASURES HAD THE NATURAL EFFECT THE MONKS WERE EVERYWHERE REGARDED AS MARTYRS AND THE IMAGE WORSHIP WHICH THEY SUPPORTED GREW MORE THAN EVER POPULAR WITH THE MASSES WHILE STILL IN THE FULL VIGOUR OF HIS PERSECUTING ENTHUSIASM
7859-102521-0010 WHILE THE EMPRESS DOWAGER IRENE BECAME SOLE REGENT AND HER NAME WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT OF HER SON IN ALL ACTS OF STATE
7859-102521-0011 BUT IN HIS TWENTY SECOND YEAR HE REBELLED AGAINST HIS MOTHER'S DICTATION AND TOOK HIS PLACE AT THE HELM OF THE STATE IRENE HAD ACTUALLY STRIVEN TO OPPOSE HIM BY ARMED FORCE BUT HE PARDONED HER AND AFTER SECLUDING HER FOR A SHORT TIME
7859-102521-0012 RESTORED HER TO HER FORMER DIGNITY THE UNNATURAL MOTHER WAS FAR FROM ACQUIESCING IN HER SON'S ELEVATION
7859-102521-0013 SEIZED THE YOUNG EMPEROR BLINDED HIM AND IMMURED HIM IN A MONASTERY BEFORE ANY OF HIS ADHERENTS WERE ABLE TO COME TO HIS AID
7859-102521-0014 HER GRAND TREASURER HAVING GAINED OVER SOME OF THE EUNUCHS AND OTHER COURTIERS ABOUT HER PERSON
7859-102521-0015 THE ICONOCLASTIC CONTROVERSY HAD PREPARED THE WAY FOR IT WHILE THE FACT THAT A WOMAN SAT ON THE IMPERIAL THRONE SERVED AS A GOOD EXCUSE FOR THE POPE'S ACTION LEO DECLARED THAT A FEMALE REIGN WAS AN ANOMALY AND AN ABOMINATION
7859-102521-0016 AND TOOK UPON HIMSELF THE ONUS OF ENDING IT SO FAR AS ITALY WAS CONCERNED BY CREATING A NEW EMPEROR OF THE WEST
7859-102521-0017 THERE WAS OF COURSE NO LEGALITY IN THE ACT AND KARL THE GREAT WAS IN NO REAL SENSE THE SUCCESSOR OF HONORIUS AND ROMULUS AUGUSTULUS BUT HE RULED A GROUP OF KINGDOMS WHICH EMBRACED THE LARGER HALF OF THE OLD WESTERN EMPIRE AND FORMED A FAIR EQUIPOISE TO THE REALM NOW RULED BY IRENE FROM EIGHT HUNDRED THEN ONWARD WE HAVE ONCE MORE A WEST ROMAN EMPIRE IN EXISTENCE AS WELL AS THE EAST ROMAN

8014-112586-0001 NINETEEN O SEVEN PRINTED BY PONSONBY AND GIBBS UNIVERSITY PRESS DUBLIN PREFACE
8014-112586-0002 THIS LITTLE BOOK HAS BEEN WRITTEN AND PUBLISHED WITH THE MAIN OBJECT OF SPREADING AS WIDELY AS POSSIBLE AMONG OUR PEOPLE YOUNG AND OLD A KNOWLEDGE OF THE CIVILISATION AND GENERAL SOCIAL CONDITION OF IRELAND FROM THE FIFTH OR SIXTH
8014-112586-0003 WHEN IT WAS WHOLLY GOVERNED BY NATIVE RULERS THE PUBLICATION COMES AT AN APPROPRIATE TIME WHEN THERE IS AN AWAKENING OF INTEREST IN THE IRISH LANGUAGE AND IN IRISH LORE OF EVERY KIND UNPARALLELED IN OUR HISTORY BUT THE BOOK HAS A FURTHER MISSION
8014-112586-0004 THERE ARE MANY ENGLISH AND MANY ANGLO IRISH PEOPLE WHO THINK MERELY FROM IGNORANCE THAT IRELAND WAS A BARBAROUS AND HALF SAVAGE COUNTRY BEFORE THE ENGLISH CAME AMONG THE PEOPLE AND CIVILISED THEM THIS BOOK SO FAR AS IT FINDS ITS WAY AMONG THE TWO CLASSES ABOVE MENTIONED WILL
8014-112586-0005 I FANCY OPEN THEIR EYES THEY WILL LEARN FROM IT THAT THE OLD IRISH SO FAR FROM BEING BARBAROUS WERE A BRIGHT INTELLECTUAL AND CULTURED PEOPLE THAT THEY HAD PROFESSIONS TRADES AND INDUSTRIES PERVADING THE WHOLE POPULATION
8014-112586-0006 WITH CLEARLY DEFINED RANKS AND GRADES OF SOCIETY ALL WORKING UNDER AN ELABORATE SYSTEM OF NATIVE LAWS AND THAT IN THE STEADYING AND CIVILISING ARTS AND PURSUITS OF EVERYDAY LIFE THEY WERE AS WELL ADVANCED AS ORDERLY
8014-112586-0007 AND AS REGULAR AS ANY OTHER EUROPEAN PEOPLE OF THE SAME PERIOD THEY WILL FIND TOO THAT AS REGARDS EDUCATION SCHOLARSHIP AND GENERAL MENTAL CULTURE THE IRISH OF THOSE EARLY AGES WERE IN ADVANCE OF ALL OTHER COUNTRIES OF EUROPE
8014-112586-0008 THAT THEY HELPED MOST MATERIALLY TO SPREAD CHRISTIANITY AND TO REVIVE LEARNING ALL OVER THE CONTINENT AND THAT TO IRISH MISSIONARIES AND SCHOLARS THE ANGLO SAXONS OF THE HEPTARCHY WERE INDEBTED FOR THE GREATER PART OF THEIR CHRISTIANITY
8014-112586-0009 AND FOR THE PRESERVATION AND RESTORATION OF LEARNING WHEN IT WAS THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION ALL OVER ENGLAND BY THE RAVAGES OF THE DANES BUT THERE WERE AND ARE ENGLISHMEN BETTER INFORMED ABOUT OUR COUNTRY
8014-112586-0010 MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE GREAT ENGLISH POET EDMUND SPENSER LIVED FOR SOME TIME IN IRELAND AND MADE HIMSELF WELL ACQUAINTED WITH ITS HISTORY HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS IN PAST AGES
8014-112586-0011 OF WEALTH AND GOODNESSE FAR ABOVE THE REST
8014-112586-0012 BUT IT IS BETTER NOT TO PURSUE THESE OBSERVATIONS FARTHER HERE AS IT WOULD BE ONLY ANTICIPATING WHAT WILL BE FOUND IN THE BODY OF THE BOOK THIS BOOK IS THE LAST OF A SERIES OF THREE OF WHICH THE SECOND IS ABRIDGED FROM THE FIRST AND THE THIRD FROM BOTH
8014-112586-0013 THE FIRST A SOCIAL HISTORY OF ANCIENT IRELAND
8014-112586-0014 CONTAINS A COMPLETE SURVEY OF THE SOCIAL LIFE AND INSTITUTIONS OF ANCIENT IRELAND ALL THE IMPORTANT STATEMENTS IN IT ARE PROVED HOME BY REFERENCES TO AUTHORITIES
8014-112586-0015 THE SECOND A SMALLER SOCIAL HISTORY OF ANCIENT IRELAND
8014-112586-0016 FIVE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT PAGES IN TWENTY SEVEN CHAPTERS WITH TWO HUNDRED THIRTEEN ILLUSTRATIONS TRAVERSES THE SAME GROUND AS THE LARGER WORK BUT BESIDES CONDENSATION MOST OF THE ILLUSTRATIVE QUOTATIONS AND NEARLY ALL THE REFERENCES TO AUTHORITIES ARE OMITTED
8014-112586-0017 THIS THIRD BOOK THE STORY OF ANCIENT IRISH CIVILISATION GIVES IN SIMPLE PLAIN LANGUAGE AN ACCOUNT OF THE CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY IN THE OLDEN TIME BUT AS IT IS HERE TO SPEAK FOR ITSELF I NEED NOT DESCRIBE IT FURTHER
8014-112586-0018 FOR ALL THE STATEMENTS IT CONTAINS FULL AND SATISFACTORY AUTHORITIES WILL BE FOUND IN THE TWO LARGER WORKS I HAVE DONE MY BEST TO MAKE ALL THREE READABLE AND INTERESTING AS WELL AS INSTRUCTIVE
8014-112586-0019 THE ORDINARY HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY MANY AND THE READER HAS A WIDE CHOICE BUT IN THE MATTER OF OUR SOCIAL HISTORY HE HAS NO CHOICE AT ALL FOR THESE THREE BOOKS OF MINE HAVE FOR THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME
8014-112586-0020 BROUGHT WITHIN THE REACH OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC A KNOWLEDGE OF THE WHOLE SOCIAL LIFE OF ANCIENT IRELAND P W J LYRE NA GRENA FEBRUARY
8014-112602-0000 AN OVAL FACE BROAD ABOVE AND NARROW BELOW GOLDEN HAIR FAIR SKIN WHITE DELICATE AND WELL FORMED HANDS WITH SLENDER TAPERING FINGERS THESE WERE CONSIDERED AS MARKING THE TYPE OF BEAUTY AND OF HIGH FAMILY DESCENT
8014-112602-0001 THEY WERE THE MARKS OF ARISTOCRACY TO THESE NATURAL ADVANTAGES THE PEOPLE ADDED BY THE USUAL ARTIFICIAL MEANS AMONG THE HIGHER CLASSES THE FINGER NAILS WERE KEPT CAREFULLY CUT AND ROUNDED
8014-112602-0002 IT WAS CONSIDERED SHAMEFUL FOR A MAN OF POSITION TO HAVE ROUGH UNKEMPT NAILS CRIMSON COLOURED FINGER NAILS WERE GREATLY ADMIRED
8014-112602-0003 I SLEEP NO MORE AND I SHALL NOT CRIMSON MY NAILS NO JOY SHALL EVER AGAIN COME UPON MY MIND
8014-112602-0004 LADIES OFTEN DYED THE EYEBROWS BLACK WITH THE JUICE OF SOME SORT OF BERRY
8014-112602-0005 THAT THE IRISH MISSIONARY MONKS SOMETIMES PAINTED OR DYED THEIR EYELIDS BLACK AN ENTRY IN CORMAC'S GLOSSARY PLAINLY INDICATES THAT THE BLUSH OF THE CHEEKS WAS SOMETIMES HEIGHTENED BY A COLOURING MATTER OBTAINED FROM THE ALDER TREE
8014-112602-0006 AND THE SPRIGS AND BERRIES OF THE ELDER WERE APPLIED TO THE SAME PURPOSE AMONG GREEK AND ROMAN LADIES THE PRACTICE WAS VERY GENERAL OF PAINTING THE CHEEKS EYEBROWS AND OTHER PARTS OF THE FACE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN WORE THE HAIR LONG
8014-112602-0007 THE HAIR WAS COMBED DAILY AFTER A BATH THE HEROES OF THE FENA OF ERIN BEFORE SITTING DOWN TO THEIR DINNER AFTER A HARD DAY'S HUNTING ALWAYS TOOK A BATH AND CAREFULLY COMBED THEIR LONG HAIR AMONG THE HIGHER CLASSES IN VERY EARLY TIMES
8014-112602-0008 GREAT CARE WAS BESTOWED ON THE HAIR ITS REGULATION CONSTITUTED QUITE AN ART AND IT WAS DRESSED UP IN SEVERAL WAYS VERY OFTEN THE LONG HAIR OF MEN AS WELL AS OF WOMEN WAS ELABORATELY CURLED CONALL KERNACH'S HAIR AS DESCRIBED IN THE STORY OF DA DERGA
8014-112602-0009 FLOWED DOWN HIS BACK AND WAS DONE UP IN
8014-112602-0010 HOOKS AND PLAITS AND SWORDLETS
8014-112602-0011 THE ACCURACY OF THIS AND OTHER SIMILAR DESCRIPTIONS IS FULLY BORNE OUT BY THE MOST UNQUESTIONABLE AUTHORITY OF ALL NAMELY THE FIGURES IN THE EARLY ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS AND ON THE SHRINES AND HIGH CROSSES OF LATER AGES
8014-112602-0012 IN NEARLY ALL THE FIGURES OF THE BOOK OF KELLS FOR EXAMPLE SEVENTH OR EIGHTH CENTURY THE HAIR IS COMBED AND DRESSED WITH THE UTMOST CARE SO BEAUTIFULLY ADJUSTED INDEED THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE ONLY BY SKILLED PROFESSIONAL HAIRDRESSERS
8014-112602-0013 AND MUST HAVE OCCUPIED MUCH TIME WHETHER IN CASE OF MEN OR WOMEN
8014-112602-0014 AND IS COMMONLY DIVIDED THE WHOLE WAY AS WELL AS ALL OVER THE HEAD INTO SLENDER FILLETS OR LOCKS WHICH SOMETIMES HANG DOWN TO THE EYES IN FRONT I DO NOT FIND MENTIONED ANYWHERE THAT THE IRISH DYED THEIR HAIR AS WAS THE CUSTOM AMONG THE GREEKS AND ROMANS
8014-112602-0015 THE MEN WERE AS PARTICULAR ABOUT THE BEARD AS ABOUT THE HAIR THE FASHION OF WEARING THE BEARD VARIED
8014-112602-0016 AND GRADUALLY NARROWED TO TWO POINTS BELOW SOMETIMES AS SHOWN IN MANY ANCIENT FIGURES IT FALLS DOWN IN A SINGLE MASS WHILE IN A FEW IT IS CUT STRAIGHT ACROSS AT BOTTOM NOT UNLIKE ASSYRIAN BEARDS NEARLY ALL HAVE A MUSTACHE
8014-112602-0017 IN MOST CASES CURLED UP AND POINTED AT THE ENDS AS WE OFTEN SEE NOW IN MANY THE BEARD IS CAREFULLY DIVIDED INTO SLENDER TWISTED FILLETS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE FOR THE HAIR KINGS AND CHIEFS HAD BARBERS IN THEIR SERVICE TO ATTEND TO ALL THIS
8014-112602-0018 RAZORS WERE USED MADE OF BRONZE AS HARD AS STEEL AS WE KNOW BY FINDING THEM MENTIONED IN IRISH DOCUMENTS AS EARLY AS THE EIGHTH CENTURY AND MANY OLD BRONZE RAZORS ARE NOW PRESERVED IN MUSEUMS
8014-112602-0019 FROM WHAT PRECEDES IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT COMBS WERE IN GENERAL USE WITH MEN AS WELL AS WITH WOMEN AND MANY SPECIMENS OF COMBS ARE NOW FOUND IN THE REMAINS OF ANCIENT DWELLINGS BATHING WAS VERY USUAL AT LEAST AMONG THE UPPER CLASSES
8014-112602-0020 AND BATHS AND THE USE OF BATHS ARE CONSTANTLY MENTIONED IN THE OLD TALES AND OTHER WRITINGS IN EVERY PUBLIC HOSTEL IN EVERY MONASTERY AND IN EVERY HIGH CLASS HOUSE THERE WAS A BATH WITH ITS ACCOMPANIMENTS SOAP WAS USED BOTH IN BATHING AND WASHING
8014-112602-0021 THE MODES OF MANUFACTURING THEM WILL BE MENTIONED SILK AND SATIN WHICH WERE OF COURSE IMPORTED WERE MUCH WORN AMONG THE HIGHER CLASSES THE FURS OF ANIMALS SUCH AS SEALS OTTERS BADGERS FOXES ET CETERA WERE MUCH USED FOR CAPES AND JACKETS
8014-112602-0022 AND FOR THE EDGINGS OF VARIOUS GARMENTS SO THAT SKINS OF ALL THE VARIOUS KINDS WERE VALUABLE THEY FORMED TOO AN IMPORTANT ITEM OF EVERYDAY TRAFFIC AND THEY WERE ALSO EXPORTED THE ANCIENT IRISH LOVED BRIGHT COLOURS
8014-112602-0023 IN THIS RESPECT THEY RESEMBLED MANY OTHER NATIONS OF ANTIQUITY AS WELL INDEED AS OF THE PRESENT DAY AND THEY ILLUSTRATED RUSKIN'S SAYING
8014-112602-0024 WHENEVER MEN ARE NOBLE THEY LOVE BRIGHT COLOUR
8014-112602-0025 IN SKY SEA FLOWERS
8014-112602-0026 AND WE KNOW THAT THEY WELL UNDERSTOOD THE ART OF DYEING THE SEVERAL ARTICLES OF DRESS ON ONE PERSON WERE USUALLY COLOURED DIFFERENTLY EVEN THE SINGLE OUTER CLOAK WAS OFTEN STRIPED SPOTTED OR CHEQUERED IN VARIOUS COLOURS KING DOMNALL IN THE SEVENTH CENTURY
8014-112602-0027 ON ONE OCCASION SENT A MANY COLOURED TUNIC TO HIS FOSTER SON PRINCE CONGAL LIKE JOSEPH'S COAT OF MANY COLOURS A VERY COMMON ARTICLE OF DRESS WAS A LARGE CLOAK GENERALLY WITHOUT SLEEVES
8014-112602-0028 VARYING IN LENGTH BUT COMMONLY COVERING THE WHOLE PERSON FROM THE SHOULDERS DOWN THE PEOPLE ALSO WORE A TIGHT FITTING COAT WITH SLEEVES
8014-112602-0029 BUT IT WAS MUCH SHORTER AND WITHOUT A COLLAR
8014-112602-0030 A SHORT CAPE WAS OFTEN WORN ON THE SHOULDERS SOMETIMES CARRYING A HOOD TO COVER THE HEAD THE OUTER COVERING OF THE GENERAL RUN OF THE PEASANTRY WAS JUST ONE LOOSE SLEEVED COAT OR MANTLE
8014-112602-0031 WHICH COVERED THEM DOWN TO THE ANKLES AND WHICH THEY WORE WINTER AND SUMMER WOMEN COMMONLY WORE A LONG LOOSE CLOAK WITH A HOOD A FASHION WHICH IS COMMON AT THE PRESENT DAY THE OVER GARMENTS WERE FASTENED BY BROOCHES PINS BUTTONS
8014-112602-0032 GIRDLES STRINGS AND LOOPS MANY OF THEM BEAUTIFULLY MADE AND ORNAMENTED THE ANCIENT IRISH WORE A TROUSERS WHICH WAS SO TIGHT FITTING AS TO SHOW PERFECTLY THE SHAPE OF THE LIMBS WHEN TERMINATING BELOW THE ANKLES IT WAS HELD DOWN BY A SLENDER STRAP PASSING UNDER THE FOOT
8014-112602-0033 LIKE OTHER IRISH GARMENTS IT WAS GENERALLY STRIPED OR SPECKLED IN VARIOUS COLOURS LEGGINGS OF CLOTH OR OF THIN SOFT LEATHER WERE USED AND WERE LACED ON BY STRINGS TIPPED WITH WHITE BRONZE
8014-112602-0034 A KILT WAS OFTEN WORN IN WHICH CASE THE LEGS WERE LEFT BARE AT THE KNEES WITH LEGGINGS BELOW FOR THE KILT IS OF IRISH ORIGIN AND WAS BROUGHT LIKE MANY OTHER FASHIONS BY THE EARLY COLONISTS TO SCOTLAND
8014-112602-0035 AND WHEN NOT ACTUALLY WORN WAS USUALLY CARRIED AMONG OTHER SMALL ARTICLES IN A LADY'S ORNAMENTAL HAND BAG SHOES WERE OFTEN MADE OF UNTANNED HIDE STITCHED WITH THONGS WITH SEVERAL LAYERS FOR A SOLE BUT THERE WAS A MORE SHAPELY SHOE MADE OF FULLY TANNED LEATHER
8014-112602-0036 HAVING SERVICEABLE SOLE AND HEEL AND OFTEN ORNAMENTED WITH PATTERNS STAMPED IN THE IRISH WERE EXCESSIVELY FOND OF PERSONAL ORNAMENTS WHICH AMONG THE HIGHER CLASSES WERE MADE OF EXPENSIVE MATERIALS SUCH AS GOLD SILVER GEMS WHITE BRONZE ET CETERA
8014-112602-0037 THEY WORE RINGS AND BRACELETS OF VARIOUS SHAPES ON THE FINGERS INCLUDING THE THUMB ROUND THE WRIST AND FOREARM AND EVEN ROUND THE LEG ABOVE THE ANKLE
8014-112602-0038 ALL OF WHICH MATERIALS WERE FOUND NATIVE THEY HAD TORQUES FOR THE NECK MADE OF TWISTED GOLD BARS AND THE ELABORATE AND IMMENSELY EXPENSIVE CRESCENTS OR GORGETS
8014-112602-0039 THERE WAS A GOLD ORNAMENT A KIND OF OPEN RING WITH BOSSES OR BUTTONS ON THE ENDS
8014-112602-0040 WORN ON THE BREAST SUSPENDED FROM AN ORNAMENTED BUTTON THIN CIRCULAR GOLD PLATES WERE ALSO WORN FASTENED ON THE BREAST AND AS FOR BROOCHES THEY WERE OF ALL SHAPES AND SIZES SOME PLAIN SIMPLE AND CHEAP
8014-112602-0041 SOME OF GOLD OR OTHER EXPENSIVE MATERIAL OF ELABORATE WORKMANSHIP
8014-280382-0000 FLED TO LARS PORSENNA KING OF CLUSIUM AND BESOUGHT HIM THAT HE WOULD HELP THEM SUFFER NOT THEY SAID THAT WE WHO ARE TUSCANS BY BIRTH SHOULD REMAIN ANY MORE IN POVERTY AND EXILE
8014-280382-0001 AND TAKE HEED ALSO TO THYSELF AND THINE OWN KINGDOM IF THOU PERMIT THIS NEW FASHION OF DRIVING FORTH KINGS TO GO UNPUNISHED
8014-280382-0002 THAT IN FREEDOM WHICH MEN GREATLY DESIRE AND IF THEY THAT BE KINGS DEFEND NOT THEIR DIGNITY AS STOUTLY AS OTHERS SEEK TO OVERTHROW IT THEN SHALL THE HIGHEST BE MADE EVEN AS THE LOWEST AND THERE SHALL BE AN END OF KINGSHIP THAN WHICH THERE IS NOTHING MORE HONORABLE UNDER HEAVEN
8014-280382-0003 WITH THESE WORDS THEY PERSUADED KING PORSENNA WHO JUDGING IT WELL FOR THE ETRURIANS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A KING AT ROME AND THAT KING AN ETRURIAN BY BIRTH GATHERED TOGETHER A GREAT ARMY AND CAME UP AGAINST ROME
8014-280382-0004 BUT WHEN MEN HEARD OF HIS COMING SO MIGHTY A CITY WAS CLUSIUM IN THOSE DAYS AND SO GREAT THE FAME OF KING PORSENNA
8014-280382-0005 IN THE MEANWHILE I SO FAR AS ONE MAN MAY DO WILL STAY THE ENEMY AND AS HE SPAKE HE RAN FORWARD TO THE FARTHER END OF THE BRIDGE AND MADE READY TO KEEP THE WAY AGAINST THE ENEMY NEVERTHELESS THERE STOOD TWO WITH HIM
8014-280382-0006 LARTIUS AND HERMINIUS BY NAME MEN OF NOBLE BIRTH BOTH OF THEM AND OF GREAT RENOWN IN ARMS SO THESE THREE FOR A WHILE STAYED THE FIRST ONSET OF THE ENEMY AND THE MEN OF ROME MEANWHILE BRAKE DOWN THE BRIDGE AND WHEN THERE WAS BUT A SMALL PART REMAINING
8014-280382-0007 AND THEY THAT BRAKE IT DOWN CALLED TO THE THREE THAT THEY SHOULD COME BACK HORATIUS BADE LARTIUS AND HERMINIUS RETURN BUT HE HIMSELF REMAINED ON THE FARTHER SIDE TURNING HIS EYES FULL OF WRATH IN THREATENING FASHION ON THE PRINCES OF THE ETRURIANS AND CRYING
8014-280382-0008 KING PORSENNA TO ROB OTHERS OF THE FREEDOM THAT YE CARE NOT TO HAVE FOR YOURSELVES
8014-280382-0009 LOOKING EACH MAN TO HIS NEIGHBOR WHO SHOULD FIRST DEAL WITH THIS CHAMPION OF THE ROMANS THEN FOR VERY SHAME THEY ALL RAN FORWARD AND RAISING A GREAT SHOUT THREW THEIR JAVELINS AT HIM THESE ALL HE TOOK UPON HIS SHIELD NOR STOOD THE LESS FIRMLY IN HIS PLACE ON THE BRIDGE
8014-280382-0010 FOR THE BRIDGE WAS NOW ALTOGETHER BROKEN DOWN
8014-280382-0011 AND AS THE ENEMY STAYED A WHILE FOR FEAR HORATIUS TURNED HIM TO THE RIVER AND SAID O FATHER TIBER I BESEECH THEE THIS DAY WITH ALL REVERENCE THAT THOU KINDLY RECEIVE THIS SOLDIER AND HIS ARMS AND AS HE SPAKE HE LEAPT WITH ALL HIS ARMS INTO THE RIVER
8014-280382-0012 AND SWAM ACROSS TO HIS OWN PEOPLE AND THOUGH MANY JAVELINS OF THE ENEMY FELL ABOUT HIM HE WAS NOT ONE WHIT HURT NOR DID SUCH VALOR FAIL TO RECEIVE DUE HONOR FROM THE CITY
8063-274112-0000 AND EXCEEDINGLY UNHAPPY IN FACT D'ARTAGNAN D'ARTAGNAN WE SAY FOR WE MUST CALL HIM BY HIS NAME TO REMIND OUR READERS OF HIS EXISTENCE D'ARTAGNAN WE REPEAT
8063-274112-0001 HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO AMIDST THESE BRILLIANT BUTTERFLIES OF FASHION AFTER FOLLOWING THE KING DURING TWO WHOLE DAYS AT FONTAINEBLEAU
8063-274112-0002 THE MUSKETEER FELT THAT HE NEEDED SOMETHING MORE THAN THIS TO SATISFY THE CRAVINGS OF HIS NATURE AT EVERY MOMENT ASSAILED BY PEOPLE ASKING HIM HOW DO YOU THINK THIS COSTUME SUITS ME MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN HE WOULD REPLY TO THEM IN QUIET SARCASTIC TONES
8063-274112-0003 WHY I THINK YOU ARE QUITE AS WELL DRESSED AS THE
8063-274112-0004 IT WAS JUST SUCH A COMPLIMENT D'ARTAGNAN WOULD CHOOSE WHERE HE DID NOT FEEL DISPOSED TO PAY ANY OTHER
8063-274112-0005 WHENEVER ANY ONE ASKED HIM HOW DO YOU INTEND TO DRESS YOURSELF THIS EVENING HE REPLIED I SHALL UNDRESS MYSELF AT WHICH THE LADIES ALL LAUGHED
8063-274112-0006 AND ALSO TO RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE D'ARTAGNAN ASKED THE KING FOR LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR A MATTER OF PRIVATE BUSINESS AT THE MOMENT D'ARTAGNAN MADE HIS REQUEST
8063-274112-0007 QUITE EXHAUSTED FROM DANCING YOU WISH TO LEAVE ME MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN INQUIRED THE KING WITH AN AIR OF ASTONISHMENT
8063-274112-0008 ANY ONE WHO HAD THE DISTINGUISHED HONOR OF BEING NEAR HIM COULD WISH TO LEAVE HIM SIRE SAID D'ARTAGNAN
8063-274112-0009 AH IF I COULD ONLY HOLD THE BALANCING POLE WHILE YOU WERE DANCING IT WOULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT AFFAIR BUT MY DEAR MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN SAID THE KING GRAVELY PEOPLE DANCE WITHOUT BALANCING POLES
8063-274112-0010 AH INDEED SAID THE MUSKETEER CONTINUING HIS IMPERCEPTIBLE TONE OF IRONY
8063-274112-0011 THEREFORE AT FONTAINEBLEAU FOR TO DO SO WOULD BE USELESS BUT WITH THE PERMISSION OF OUR READERS FOLLOW HIM TO THE RUE DES LOMBARDS WHERE HE WAS LOCATED AT THE SIGN OF THE PILON D'OR
8063-274112-0012 AND THE WEATHER WAS EXCEEDINGLY WARM THERE WAS ONLY ONE WINDOW OPEN AND THAT ONE BELONGING TO A ROOM
8063-274112-0013 A PERFUME OF SPICES MINGLED WITH ANOTHER PERFUME LESS EXOTIC BUT MORE PENETRATING NAMELY THAT WHICH AROSE FROM THE STREET ASCENDED TO SALUTE THE NOSTRILS OF THE MUSKETEER D'ARTAGNAN RECLINING IN AN IMMENSE STRAIGHT BACKED CHAIR WITH HIS LEGS NOT STRETCHED OUT
8063-274112-0014 BUT SIMPLY PLACED UPON A STOOL FORMED AN ANGLE OF THE MOST OBTUSE FORM THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE SEEN BOTH HIS ARMS WERE CROSSED OVER HIS HEAD HIS HEAD RECLINING UPON HIS LEFT SHOULDER LIKE ALEXANDER THE GREAT HIS EYES
8063-274112-0015 USUALLY SO QUICK AND INTELLIGENT IN THEIR EXPRESSION WERE NOW HALF CLOSED AND SEEMED FASTENED AS IT WERE UPON A SMALL CORNER OF BLUE SKY THAT WAS VISIBLE BEHIND THE OPENING OF THE CHIMNEYS
8063-274112-0016 THERE WAS JUST ENOUGH BLUE AND NO MORE TO FILL ONE OF THE SACKS OF LENTILS OR HARICOTS WHICH FORMED THE PRINCIPAL FURNITURE OF THE SHOP ON THE GROUND FLOOR THUS EXTENDED AT HIS EASE AND SHELTERED IN HIS PLACE OF OBSERVATION BEHIND THE WINDOW D'ARTAGNAN
8063-274112-0017 SEEMED AS IF HE HAD CEASED TO BE A SOLDIER AS IF HE WERE NO LONGER AN OFFICER BELONGING TO THE PALACE BUT WAS ON THE CONTRARY A QUIET EASY GOING CITIZEN IN A STATE OF STAGNATION BETWEEN HIS DINNER AND SUPPER OR BETWEEN HIS SUPPER AND HIS BED
8063-274112-0018 WHILE THE WINDOWS OF THE UPPER APARTMENTS WERE BEING CLOSED AND THE RHYTHMIC STEPS OF A PATROL OF SOLDIERS FORMING THE NIGHT WATCH COULD BE HEARD RETREATING D'ARTAGNAN CONTINUED HOWEVER TO THINK OF NOTHING EXCEPT THE BLUE CORNER OF THE SKY A FEW PACES FROM HIM
8063-274112-0019 AND HIS EYES FIXED ON D'ARTAGNAN WHO WAS EITHER THINKING DREAMING OR SLEEPING WITH HIS EYES OPEN
8063-274112-0020 BUT D'ARTAGNAN DID NOT STIR
8063-274112-0021 AFTER A PROLONGED REFLECTION ON THE SUBJECT THE MOST INGENIOUS MEANS THAT SUGGESTED ITSELF TO HIM UNDER THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES WAS TO LET HIMSELF ROLL OFF THE SACK ON TO THE FLOOR MURMURING AT THE SAME TIME AGAINST HIMSELF THE WORD STUPID BUT
8063-274112-0022 NOTWITHSTANDING THE NOISE PRODUCED BY PLANCHET'S FALL D'ARTAGNAN WHO HAD IN THE COURSE OF HIS EXISTENCE HEARD MANY OTHER AND VERY DIFFERENT FALLS DID NOT APPEAR TO PAY THE LEAST ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT ONE BESIDES
8063-274112-0023 AND YET PLANCHET FANCIED THAT IN TOKEN OF TACIT APPROVAL HE SAW HIM IMPERCEPTIBLY SMILE AT THE WORD STUPID THIS EMBOLDENED HIM TO SAY ARE YOU ASLEEP MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN NO PLANCHET I AM NOT EVEN ASLEEP REPLIED THE MUSKETEER
8063-274112-0024 I AM IN DESPAIR SAID PLANCHET TO HEAR SUCH A WORD AS EVEN WELL
8063-274112-0025 OF COURSE MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN WELL WELL THEN THE WORD DISTRESSES ME BEYOND MEASURE TELL ME WHY YOU ARE DISTRESSED PLANCHET SAID D'ARTAGNAN IF YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE NOT EVEN ASLEEP
8063-274112-0026 PLANCHET YOU KNOW THAT I AM NEVER BORED EXCEPT TO DAY AND THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY BAH MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN IT IS A WEEK SINCE YOU RETURNED HERE FROM FONTAINEBLEAU
8063-274112-0027 IN OTHER WORDS YOU HAVE NO LONGER YOUR ORDERS TO ISSUE OR YOUR MEN TO REVIEW AND MANEUVER YOU NEED THE SOUND OF GUNS DRUMS AND ALL THAT DIN AND CONFUSION
8063-274112-0028 WHEN YOU WERE THERE WHEN WE BOTH WERE THERE A CERTAIN ARAB
8063-274112-0029 HE WAS A CLEVER FELLOW ALTHOUGH OF A VERY ODD COMPLEXION WHICH WAS THE SAME COLOR AS YOUR OLIVES WELL THIS ARAB WHENEVER HE HAD DONE EATING OR WORKING USED TO SIT DOWN TO REST HIMSELF
8063-274112-0030 AS I AM RESTING MYSELF NOW AND SMOKED I CANNOT TELL YOU WHAT SORT OF MAGICAL LEAVES IN A LARGE AMBER MOUTHED TUBE
8063-274112-0031 BETTER TO SIT DOWN THAN TO STAND UP TO LIE DOWN THAN TO SIT DOWN TO BE DEAD THAN TO LIE DOWN HE WAS AN ACUTELY MELANCHOLY ARAB AND I REMEMBER HIM PERFECTLY WELL
8063-274112-0032 HE USED TO CUT OFF THE HEADS OF PROTESTANTS WITH THE MOST SINGULAR GUSTO PRECISELY AND THEN USED TO EMBALM THEM WHEN THEY WERE WORTH THE TROUBLE
8063-274112-0033 HE LOOKED LIKE A BASKET MAKER MAKING BASKETS YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT PLANCHET HE DID
8063-274112-0034 I HAVE NO DOUBT OF IT BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIS MODE OF REASONING
8063-274112-0035 IN POINT OF FACT THEN BETTER TO SIT DOWN THAN TO STAND UP IS PLAIN ENOUGH ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE MAY BE FATIGUED AND PLANCHET SMILED IN A ROGUISH WAY AS FOR BETTER TO BE LYING DOWN LET THAT PASS
8063-274112-0036 IT IS IN MY OPINION VERY ABSURD MY OWN UNDOUBTED PREFERENCE BEING FOR MY BED AND IF YOU ARE NOT OF MY OPINION IT IS SIMPLY AS I HAVE ALREADY HAD THE HONOR OF TELLING YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE BORING YOURSELF TO DEATH PLANCHET
8063-274112-0037 EXACTLY WELL THEN I AM LIKE HIS HARE HE HAS GOT A HARE ALSO THEN HE HAS ALL SORTS OF ANIMALS WELL WHAT DOES HIS HARE DO THEN

8063-274115-0001 FOR THE MORROW BUT THE GROCER HAD A HEART OF GOLD EVER MINDFUL OF THE GOOD OLD TIMES A TRAIT THAT CARRIES YOUTH INTO OLD AGE SO PLANCHET NOTWITHSTANDING A SORT OF INTERNAL SHIVER CHECKED AS SOON AS EXPERIENCED
8063-274115-0002 RECEIVED PORTHOS WITH RESPECT MINGLED WITH THE TENDEREST CORDIALITY PORTHOS WHO WAS A LITTLE COLD AND STIFF IN HIS MANNERS AT FIRST ON ACCOUNT OF THE SOCIAL DIFFERENCE EXISTING AT THAT PERIOD BETWEEN A BARON AND A GROCER SOON BEGAN TO SOFTEN WHEN HE PERCEIVED SO MUCH GOOD FEELING
8063-274115-0003 AND INTO THE DRAWERS FULL OF SWEETMEATS
8063-274115-0004 WHERE HIS FINGERS COULD ALWAYS FISH UP WHATEVER HIS NOSE DETECTED THE DELICIOUS FIGS FROM PROVENCE FILBERTS FROM THE FOREST TOURS PLUMS WERE SUBJECTS OF HIS UNINTERRUPTED ATTENTION FOR FIVE CONSECUTIVE HOURS HIS TEETH LIKE MILLSTONES CRACKED HEAPS OF NUTS

8063-274115-0007 HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO DISAPPEAR
8063-274115-0008 HE WILL VERY SOON HAVE NONE AT ALL TO DO IF THIS SORT OF THING CONTINUES GRUMBLED THE FOREMAN WHO HAD PLANCHET'S WORD THAT HE SHOULD BE HIS SUCCESSOR IN THE MIDST OF HIS DESPAIR
8063-274115-0009 HE APPROACHED PORTHOS WHO BLOCKED UP THE WHOLE OF THE PASSAGE LEADING FROM THE BACK SHOP TO THE SHOP ITSELF HE HOPED THAT PORTHOS WOULD RISE AND THAT THIS MOVEMENT WOULD DISTRACT HIS DEVOURING IDEAS WHAT DO YOU WANT MY MAN ASKED PORTHOS AFFABLY

8063-274115-0018 WHEN THE THREE RIDERS WHO HAD LEFT PARIS ABOUT SIX IN THE EVENING ARRIVED AT FONTAINEBLEAU
8063-274115-0019 AND SEEMED DELIGHTED TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT HIS MEADOWS HIS WOODS AND HIS RABBIT WARRENS PORTHOS HAD ALL THE TASTE AND PRIDE OF A LANDED PROPRIETOR WHEN D'ARTAGNAN SAW HIS TWO COMPANIONS IN EARNEST CONVERSATION
8063-274115-0020 SEPARATED HIMSELF FROM THE WHOLE WORLD AS HE HAD DONE FROM PORTHOS AND FROM PLANCHET THE MOON SHONE SOFTLY THROUGH THE FOLIAGE OF THE FOREST THE BREEZES OF THE OPEN COUNTRY ROSE DELICIOUSLY PERFUMED TO THE HORSE'S NOSTRILS AND THEY SNORTED AND PRANCED ALONG DELIGHTEDLY
8063-274115-0021 IN THE BEAUTIFUL MEADOWS WHERE THE GRASS GREW AS HIGH AS THE KNEES AND WHERE HE HAD PLAYED UNDER THE GREEN APPLE TREES COVERED WITH RED CHEEKED FRUIT HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE HAD SOLEMNLY PROMISED HIMSELF THAT AS SOON AS HE SHOULD HAVE MADE HIS FORTUNE HE WOULD RETURN TO NATURE
8063-274115-0022 HOW SO WHY YOU SEEM TO BE IN THE WAY OF MAKING YOUR FORTUNE VERY SOON
8063-274115-0023 WHAT IS IT INQUIRED PORTHOS LOOKING ALL ROUND HIM AS IF IN SEARCH OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT ANNOYED PLANCHET AND DESIROUS OF FREEING HIM FROM IT WHY FORMERLY SAID THE GROCER YOU USED TO CALL ME PLANCHET QUITE SHORT

8063-274115-0027 BUT A FORTUNATE MOVEMENT OF THE HORSE MADE HIM MISS HIS AIM

8063-274115-0036 WHICH IN THESE PEACEFUL TIMES IS FOR ME A SUFFICIENTLY PLEASING PICTURE OF WAR ON A SMALL SCALE
8063-274116-0000 THE CAVALIERS LOOKED UP AND SAW THAT WHAT PLANCHET HAD ANNOUNCED TO THEM WAS TRUE TEN MINUTES AFTERWARDS THEY WERE IN THE STREET CALLED THE RUE DE LYON ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HOSTELRY OF THE BEAU PAON A HIGH HEDGE OF BUSHY ELDERS

8063-274117-0025 THE TWO BEARERS OF THE CORPSE HAD UNFASTENED THE STRAPS BY WHICH THEY CARRIED THE LITTER AND WERE LETTING THEIR BURDEN GLIDE GENTLY INTO THE OPEN GRAVE
8063-274117-0026 THE GRAVE HAVING BEEN FILLED UP THE PRIESTS TURNED AWAY AND THE GRAVE DIGGER HAVING ADDRESSED A FEW WORDS TO THEM FOLLOWED THEM AS THEY MOVED AWAY
8063-274117-0027 IT IS ARAMIS HIMSELF ARAMIS IN FACT REMAINED ALONE ON THAT SIDE AT LEAST FOR HARDLY HAD HE TURNED HIS HEAD WHEN A WOMAN'S FOOTSTEPS AND THE RUSTLING OF HER DRESS WERE HEARD IN THE PATH CLOSE TO HIM HE IMMEDIATELY TURNED ROUND

8063-274117-0029 EITHER BY WAY OF ATTACK OR DEFENSE THAT THEY MUST BE CONVERSING ABOUT ANY OTHER SUBJECT THAN OF LOVE AT THE END OF THE CONVERSATION THE LADY ROSE AND BOWED PROFOUNDLY TO ARAMIS
8063-274117-0030 THE CAVALIER KNEELS AT THE BEGINNING THE YOUNG LADY BY AND BY GETS TAMED DOWN AND THEN IT IS SHE WHO HAS TO SUPPLICATE WHO IS THIS LADY I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO ASCERTAIN THIS SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE HOWEVER FOR ARAMIS WAS THE FIRST TO LEAVE
8063-274117-0031 I MUST AND WILL LEARN WHO THAT WOMAN IS SAID THE MUSKETEER AGAIN AND THEN WITHOUT FURTHER DELIBERATION HE SET OFF IN PURSUIT OF HER AS HE WAS GOING ALONG HE TRIED TO THINK HOW HE COULD POSSIBLY CONTRIVE TO MAKE HER RAISE HER VEIL SHE IS NOT YOUNG HE SAID
8063-274117-0032 AND IS A WOMAN OF HIGH RANK IN SOCIETY I OUGHT TO KNOW THAT FIGURE AND PECULIAR STYLE OF WALK AS HE RAN THE SOUND OF HIS SPURS AND OF HIS BOOTS UPON THE HARD GROUND OF THE STREET MADE A STRANGE JINGLING NOISE A FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE IN ITSELF
8063-274117-0033 WHICH HE WAS FAR FROM RECKONING UPON THE NOISE DISTURBED THE LADY SHE SEEMED TO FANCY SHE WAS BEING EITHER FOLLOWED OR PURSUED WHICH WAS INDEED THE CASE AND TURNED ROUND
8063-274117-0034 HE MURMURED MADAME DE CHEVREUSE D'ARTAGNAN WOULD NOT GO HOME UNTIL HE HAD LEARNT EVERYTHING
8063-274117-0035 A POOR FRANCISCAN MENDICANT FRIAR REPLIED THE LATTER WHO HAD NOT EVEN A DOG TO LOVE HIM IN THIS WORLD AND TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO HIS LAST RESTING PLACE IF THAT WERE REALLY THE CASE THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN
8088-284756-0000 FROM SOMEWHERE OUT ON THE BLACK HEAVING ATLANTIC THE RAPID MUFFLED POPPING OF A SPEED BOAT'S EXHAUST DRIFTED CLEARLY THROUGH THE NIGHT
8088-284756-0001 THERE WAS REAL ROMANCE AND ADVENTURE RUM RUNNERS SEEKING OUT THEIR HIDDEN PORT WITH THEIR CARGO OF CONTRABAND FROM CUBA HEADING FEARLESSLY THROUGH THE DARKNESS FIGHTING THE HIGH SEAS STILL RUNNING AFTER THE STORM OF A DAY OR SO BEFORE
8088-284756-0002 DARING A THOUSAND DANGERS FOR THE SAKE OF THE STRAW PACKED BOTTLES THEY CARRIED SEA BRONZED MEN WITH HARD FLAT MUSCLES AND FEARLESS EYES READY GUNS SLAPPING THEIR THIGHS AS THEY
8088-284756-0003 ABSORBED IN MY MENTAL PICTURE OF THESE MODERN FREE BOOTERS THE SUDDEN ALARM OF THE TELEPHONE STARTLED ME LIKE AN UNEXPECTED SHOT FIRED BESIDE MY EAR BRUSHING THE CIGARETTE ASHES FROM MY SMOKING JACKET I CROSSED THE ROOM AND SNATCHED UP THE RECEIVER
8088-284756-0004 HELLO I SNAPPED UNGRACIOUSLY INTO THE MOUTHPIECE IT WAS AFTER ELEVEN BY THE SHIP'S CLOCK ON THE MANTEL AND IF TAYLOR THE VOICE WARREN MERCER'S FAMILIAR VOICE
8088-284756-0005 GET IN YOUR CAR AND COME DOWN HERE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE COME JUST AS YOU ARE AND WHAT'S THE MATTER I MANAGED TO INTERRUPT HIM BURGLARS
8088-284756-0006 I HAD NEVER HEARD MERCER SPEAK IN THAT HIGH PITCHED EXCITED VOICE BEFORE HIS USUAL SPEECH WAS SLOW AND THOUGHTFUL ALMOST DIDACTIC
8088-284756-0007 IF IT WEREN'T URGENT I WOULDN'T BE CALLING YOU YOU KNOW WILL YOU COME YOU BET I SAID QUICKLY FEELING RATHER A FOOL FOR RAGGING HIM WHEN HE WAS IN SUCH DEADLY EARNEST HAVE THE RECEIVER SNAPPED AND CRACKLED
8088-284756-0008 USUALLY THE VERY SOUL OF COURTESY AND CONSIDERATION
8088-284756-0009 A MOMENT LATER I WAS OFF THE GRAVELLED DRIVE AND TEARING DOWN THE CONCRETE WITH THE ACCELERATOR ALL THE WAY DOWN AND THE BLACK WIND SHRIEKING AROUND THE WINDSHIELD OF MY LITTLE ROADSTER MY OWN SHACK WAS OUT OF THE CITY LIMITS
8088-284756-0010 MERCER PICKED THE PLACE UP FOR ME AT A SONG THE MONSTROSITY WAS SOME FOUR MILES FURTHER OUT FROM TOWN AND OFF THE HIGHWAY PERHAPS A HALF MILE MORE
8088-284756-0011 I MADE THE FOUR MILES IN JUST A SHADE OVER THAT MANY MINUTES AND CLAMPED ON THE BRAKES AS I SAW THE ENTRANCE TO THE LITTLE DRIVE THAT LED TOWARD THE SEA AND MERCER'S ESTATE
8088-284756-0012 WITH GRAVEL RATTLING ON MY FENDERS I TURNED OFF THE CONCRETE AND SWEPT BETWEEN THE TWO MASSIVE STUCCOED PILLARS THAT GUARDED THE DRIVE BOTH OF THEM BORE CORRODED BRONZE PLATES THE BILLOWS THE NAME GIVEN THE MONSTROSITY BY THE ORIGINAL OWNER
8088-284756-0013 A NEWLY RICH MUNITIONS MANUFACTURER THE STRUCTURE ITSELF LOOMED UP BEFORE ME IN A FEW SECONDS A RAMBLING AFFAIR WITH SQUARE SHOULDERED BALCONIES AND A GREAT DEAL OF WROUGHT IRON WORK AFTER THE MOST FLAMBOYANT SPANISH PATTERN IT WAS ABLAZE WITH LIGHT
8088-284756-0014 APPARENTLY EVERY BULB IN THE PLACE WAS BURNING JUST A FEW YARDS BEYOND THE SURF BOOMED HOLLOWLY ON THE SMOOTH SHADY SHORE LITTERED NOW I KNEW BY THE PITIFUL SPOILS OF THE STORM
8088-284756-0015 AS I CLAMPED ON MY BRAKES A SWIFT SHADOW PASSED TWO OF THE LOWER WINDOWS BEFORE I COULD LEAP FROM THE CAR THE BROAD FRONT DOOR WITH ITS ROUNDED TOP AND CIRCULAR GRILLED WINDOW WAS FLUNG WIDE AND MERCER CAME RUNNING TO MEET ME
8088-284756-0016 HE WAS WEARING A BATHROBE HASTILY FLUNG ON OVER A DAMP BATHING SUIT HIS BARE LEGS TERMINATING IN A PAIR OF DISREPUTABLE SLIPPERS FINE TAYLOR HE GREETED ME I SUPPOSE YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT I DON'T BLAME YOU BUT COME IN COME IN
8088-284756-0017 JUST WAIT TILL YOU SEE HER HER I ASKED STARTLED

8088-284756-0019 HE HURRIED ME ACROSS THE BROAD CONCRETE PORCH AND INTO THE HOUSE THROW THE CAP ANYWHERE AND COME ON TOO MUCH AMAZED TO COMMENT FURTHER I FOLLOWED MY FRIEND THIS WAS A WARREN MERCER I DID NOT KNOW
8088-284756-0020 HIS EYES DARK AND LARGE SMILED EASILY AND SHONE WITH INTEREST BUT HIS ALMOST BEAUTIFUL MOUTH BENEATH THE LONG SLIM MUSTACHE ALWAYS CLOSELY CROPPED SELDOM SMILED WITH HIS EYES BUT IT WAS HIS PRESENT EXCITED SPEECH THAT AMAZED ME MOST
8088-284756-0021 MERCER DURING ALL THE YEARS I HAD KNOWN HIM HAD NEVER BEEN MOVED BEFORE TO SUCH TEMPESTUOUS OUTBURSTS OF ENTHUSIASM IT WAS HIS HABIT TO SPEAK SLOWLY AND THOUGHTFULLY IN HIS LOW MUSICAL VOICE EVEN IN THE MIDST OF OUR HOTTEST ARGUMENTS AND WE HAD HAD MANY OF THEM
8088-284756-0022 THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM WAS NEARLY ALL GLASS AND OPENED ONTO THE PATIO AND THE SWIMMING POOL MERCER PAUSED A MOMENT WITH HIS HAND ON THE KNOB OF THE DOOR A STRANGE LIGHT IN HIS DARK EYES NOW YOU'LL SEE WHY I CALLED YOU HERE HE SAID TENSELY
8088-284756-0023 YOU CAN JUDGE FOR YOURSELF WHETHER THE TRIP WAS WORTH WHILE HERE SHE IS WITH A GESTURE HE FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR AND I STARED FOLLOWING HIS GLANCE DOWN AT THE GREAT TILED SWIMMING POOL IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO DESCRIBE THE SCENE
8088-284756-0024 THE PATIO WAS NOT LARGE BUT IT WAS BEAUTIFULLY DONE FLOWERS AND SHRUBS EVEN A FEW SMALL PALMS GREW IN PROFUSION IN THE ENCLOSURE WHILE ABOVE THROUGH THE MOVABLE GLASS ROOF MADE IN SECTIONS TO DISAPPEAR IN FINE WEATHER
8088-284756-0025 WAS THE EMPTY BLACKNESS OF THE SKY NONE OF THE LIGHTS PROVIDED FOR THE ILLUMINATION OF THE COVERED PATIO WAS TURNED ON BUT ALL THE WINDOWS SURROUNDING THE PATIO WERE AGLOW AND I COULD SEE THE POOL QUITE CLEARLY THE POOL AND ITS OCCUPANT
8088-284756-0026 WE WERE STANDING AT ONE SIDE OF THE POOL NEAR THE CENTER DIRECTLY OPPOSITE US SEATED ON THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL WAS A HUMAN FIGURE NUDE SAVE FOR A GREAT MASS OF TAWNY HAIR THAT FELL ABOUT HER LIKE A SILKEN MANTLE
8088-284756-0027 EVEN IN THE SOFT LIGHT I COULD SEE HER PERFECTLY THROUGH THE CLEAR WATER HER PALE BODY OUTLINED SHARPLY AGAINST THE JADE GREEN TILES I TORE MYSELF AWAY FROM THE STARING CURIOUS EYES OF THE FIGURE IN GOD'S NAME MERCER WHAT IS IT
8088-284756-0028 PORCELAIN I ASKED HOARSELY THE THING HAD AN INDESCRIBABLY EERY EFFECT HE LAUGHED WILDLY PORCELAIN WATCH LOOK MY EYES FOLLOWED HIS POINTING FINGER
8088-284756-0029 THE GREAT CLOUD OF CORN COLORED HAIR FLOATED DOWN ABOUT IT FALLING BELOW THE KNEES SLOWLY WITH A GRACE OF MOVEMENT COMPARABLE ONLY WITH THE SLOW SOARING OF A GULL SHE CAME TOWARD ME WALKING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL THROUGH THE CLEAR WATER AS THOUGH SHE FLOATED IN AIR
8088-284756-0030 FASCINATED I WATCHED HER HER EYES STARTLINGLY LARGE AND DARK IN THE STRANGELY WHITE FACE WERE FIXED ON MINE THERE WAS NOTHING SINISTER IN THE GAZE YET I FELT MY BODY SHAKING AS THOUGH IN THE GRIP OF A TERRIBLE FEAR
8088-284756-0031 I TRIED TO LOOK AWAY AND FOUND MYSELF UNABLE TO MOVE I FELT MERCER'S TENSE SUDDEN GRIP UPON MY ARM BUT I DID NOT COULD NOT LOOK AT HIM SHE SHE'S SMILING I HEARD HIM EXCLAIM
8088-284756-0032 HE LAUGHED AN EXCITED HIGH PITCHED LAUGH THAT IRRITATED ME IN SOME SUBTLE WAY SHE WAS SMILING AND LOOKING UP INTO MY EYES SHE WAS VERY CLOSE NOW WITHIN A FEW FEET OF US
8088-284756-0033 AND HER BOSOM RISING AND FALLING BENEATH THE VEIL OF PALE GOLD HAIR SHE WAS BREATHING WATER MERCER LITERALLY JERKED ME AWAY FROM THE EDGE OF THE POOL
8088-284756-0034 HE ASKED HIS DARK EYES DANCING WITH EXCITEMENT TELL ME ABOUT IT I SAID SHAKING MY HEAD DAZEDLY SHE IS NOT HUMAN I DON'T KNOW I THINK SO AS HUMAN AS YOU OR I I'LL TELL YOU ALL I KNOW AND THEN YOU CAN JUDGE FOR YOURSELF
8088-284756-0035 I THINK WE'LL KNOW IN A FEW MINUTES IF MY PLANS WORK OUT BUT FIRST SLIP ON A BATHING SUIT I DIDN'T ARGUE THE MATTER I LET MERCER LEAD ME AWAY WITHOUT A WORD AND WHILE I WAS CHANGING HE TOLD ME ALL HE KNEW OF THE STRANGE CREATURE IN THE POOL
8088-284756-0036 LATE THIS AFTERNOON I DECIDED TO GO FOR A LITTLE WALK ALONG THE BEACH MERCER BEGAN I HAD BEEN WORKING LIKE THE DEVIL SINCE EARLY IN THE MORNING RUNNING SOME TESTS ON WHAT YOU CALL MY THOUGHT TELEGRAPH I FELT THE NEED OF SOME FRESH SEA AIR
8088-284756-0037 I WALKED ALONG BRISKLY FOR PERHAPS FIVE MINUTES
8088-284756-0038 THE SHORE WAS LITTERED WITH ALL SORTS OF FLOTSAM AND JETSAM WASHED UP BY THE BIG STORM AND I WAS JUST THINKING THAT I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A MAN WITH A TRUCK COME AND CLEAN UP THE SHORE IN FRONT OF THE PLACE WHEN IN A LITTLE SANDY POOL I SAW HER
8088-284756-0039 SHE WAS LAYING FACE DOWN IN THE WATER MOTIONLESS HER HEAD TOWARDS THE SEA ONE ARM STRETCHED OUT BEFORE HER AND HER LONG HAIR WRAPPED AROUND HER LIKE A HALF TRANSPARENT CLOAK I RAN UP AND LIFTED HER FROM THE WATER HER BODY WAS COLD AND DEATHLY WHITE
8088-284756-0040 AND TOOK THE LIQUOR IN A SINGLE DRAUGHT SHE DID NOT SEEM TO DRINK IT BUT SUCKED IT OUT OF THE GLASS IN A SINGLE AMAZING GULP THAT'S THE ONLY WORD FOR IT
8088-284756-0041 WEBBED I ASKED STARTLED WEBBED NODDED MERCER SOLEMNLY AS ARE HER FEET BUT LISTEN TAYLOR I WAS AMAZED AND NOT A LITTLE RATTLED WHEN SHE CAME FOR ME
8088-284756-0042 I RAN THROUGH THE FRENCH WINDOWS OUT INTO THE PATIO FOR A MOMENT SHE RAN AFTER ME RATHER AWKWARDLY AND HEAVILY BUT SWIFTLY NEVERTHELESS THEN SHE SAW THE POOL APPARENTLY FORGETTING THAT I EXISTED SHE LEAPED INTO THE WATER
8088-284756-0043 I REMINDED HIM AS HE PAUSED APPARENTLY LOST IN THOUGHT I TRIED TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT HER I PUT ON MY BATHING SUIT AND DIVED INTO THE POOL WELL SHE CAME AT ME LIKE A SHARK QUICK AS A FLASH HER TEETH SHOWING HER HANDS TEARING LIKE CLAWS THROUGH THE WATER
8088-284756-0044 SHE MANAGED TO CLAW ME JUST ONCE MERCER RESUMED WRAPPING THE ROBE ABOUT HIM AGAIN THEN I GOT OUT AND CALLED ON CARSON FOR HELP I PUT HIM INTO A BATHING SUIT AND WE BOTH ENDEAVORED TO CORNER HER
8088-284756-0045 CARSON GOT TWO BAD SCRATCHES AND ONE RATHER SERIOUS BITE THAT I HAVE BANDAGED I HAVE A NUMBER OF LACERATIONS BUT I DIDN'T FARE SO BADLY AS CARSON BECAUSE I AM FASTER IN THE WATER THAN HE IS THE HARDER WE TRIED THE MORE DETERMINED I BECAME
8088-284756-0046 WE MOVED OUT OF THE ROOM NOTHING HUMAN CAN LIVE UNDER WATER AND BREATHE WATER AS SHE DOES MERCER PAUSED A MOMENT STARING AT ME ODDLY THE HUMAN RACE HE SAID GRAVELY CAME UP OUT OF SEA THE HUMAN RACE AS WE KNOW IT SOME MAY HAVE GONE BACK
8088-284756-0047 MERCER SOME MAY HAVE GONE BACK I DON'T GET IT MERCER SHOOK HIS HEAD BUT MADE NO OTHER REPLY UNTIL WE STOOD AGAIN ON THE EDGE OF THE POOL THE GIRL WAS STANDING WHERE WE HAD LEFT HER AND AS SHE LOOKED UP INTO MY FACE SHE SMILED AGAIN

8088-284756-0050 I SHOULD HAVE CALLED YOU TO MORROW FOR FURTHER TEST NEARLY FIVE YEARS OF DAMNED HARD WORK TO A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION TAYLOR
8088-284756-0051 I ASKED EAGERLY GLANCING DOWN AT THE BEAUTIFUL PALE FACE THAT GLIMMERED UP AT ME THROUGH THE CLEAR WATER OF THE POOL WHY TRY IT ON HER EXCLAIMED MERCER WITH MOUNTING ENTHUSIASM DON'T YOU SEE TAYLOR

8088-284756-0053 LOOK AND HE HELD OUT A THIN ARISTOCRATIC BROWN HAND BEFORE MY EYES A HAND THAT SHOOK WITH NERVOUS EXCITEMENT I DON'T BLAME YOU I SAID QUICKLY

8088-284756-0055 HE HAD NOT EXAGGERATED THE SET UP CONSISTED OF A WHOLE BANK OF TUBES EACH ONE IN ITS OWN SHIELDING COPPER BOX ON A MUCH DRILLED HORIZONTAL PANEL PROPPED UP ON INSULATORS WERE HALF A SCORE OF DELICATE METERS OF ONE KIND AND ANOTHER
8088-284756-0056 WITH THIN BLACK FINGERS THAT PULSED AND TREMBLED BEHIND THE PANEL WAS A TALL CYLINDER WOUND WITH SHINING COPPER WIRE AND BESIDE IT ANOTHER PANEL UPRIGHT FAIRLY BRISTLING WITH KNOBS CONTACT POINTS POTENTIOMETERS RHEOSTATS AND SWITCHES

8088-284756-0059 ON ALL FOUR ENDS WERE BRIGHT SILVERY ELECTRODES THREE OF THEM CIRCULAR IN SHAPE ONE OF THEM ELONGATED AND SLIGHTLY CURVED WITH A QUICK NERVOUS GESTURE MERCER FITTED THE THING TO HIS HEAD
8088-284756-0060 SO THAT THE ELONGATED ELECTRODE PRESSED AGAINST THE BACK OF HIS NECK EXTENDING A FEW INCHES DOWN HIS SPINE THE OTHER THREE CIRCULAR ELECTRODES RESTED ON HIS FOREHEAD AND EITHER SIDE OF HIS HEAD
8088-284756-0061 SOME TEN FEET IN LENGTH ENDING IN A SIMPLE SWITCHBOARD PLUG WHICH MERCER FITTED INTO THE UPPERMOST OF THE THREE JACKS NOW HE DIRECTED YOU PUT ON THIS ONE
8088-284756-0062 HE ADJUSTED A SECOND CONTRIVANCE UPON MY HEAD SMILING AS I SHRANK FROM THE CONTACT OF THE COLD METAL ON MY SKIN AND THINK HE MOVED THE SWITCH FROM THE POSITION MARKED OFF TO THE SECOND CONTACT POINT WATCHING ME INTENTLY HIS DARK EYES GLEAMING
8088-284756-0063 VERY NICE OLD CHAP CARSON IMPRESSIVE EVEN IN HIS BATHING SUIT MERCER WAS MIGHTY LUCKY TO HAVE A MAN LIKE CARSON SOMETHING SEEMED TO TICK SUDDENLY SOMEWHERE DEEP IN MY CONSCIOUSNESS YES THAT'S VERY TRUE
8088-284756-0064 THE WORDS WERE NOT SPOKEN I DID NOT HEAR THEM I KNEW THEM WHAT I GLANCED AT MERCER AND HE LAUGHED ALOUD WITH PLEASURE AND EXCITEMENT IT WORKED HE CRIED
8088-284756-0065 I RECEIVED YOUR THOUGHT REGARDING CARSON AND THEN TURNED THE SWITCH SO THAT YOU RECEIVED MY THOUGHT AND YOU DID RATHER GINGERLY I REMOVED THE THING FROM MY HEAD AND LAID IT ON THE TABLE IT'S WIZARDRY MERCER IF IT WILL WORK AS WELL ON HER IT WILL I KNOW IT WILL
8088-284756-0066 IF WE CAN GET HER TO WEAR ONE OF THESE REPLIED MERCER CONFIDENTLY I HAVE ONLY THREE OF THEM I HAD PLANNED SOME THREE CORNERED EXPERIMENTS WITH YOU CARSON AND MYSELF WE'LL LEAVE CARSON OUT OF TO NIGHT'S EXPERIMENT HOWEVER FOR WE'LL NEED HIM TO OPERATE THIS SWITCH
8088-284756-0067 THE OTHER TWO RECEIVE WHEN THE SWITCH IS ON THE FIRST CONTACT NUMBER ONE SENDS AND NUMBERS TWO AND THREE RECEIVE WHEN THE SWITCH IS ON NUMBER TWO THEN HE SENDS THOUGHTS AND NUMBERS ONE AND THREE RECEIVE THEM AND SO ON
8088-284756-0068 I'LL LENGTHEN THESE LEADS SO THAT WE CAN RUN THEM OUT INTO THE POOL AND THEN WE'LL BE READY SOMEHOW WE MUST INDUCE HER TO WEAR ONE OF THESE THINGS EVEN IF WE HAVE TO USE FORCE I'M SURE THE THREE OF US CAN HANDLE HER WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO I SMILED
8088-284756-0069 SHE WAS SUCH A SLIM GRACEFUL ALMOST DELICATE LITTLE THING THE THOUGHT THAT THREE STRONG MEN MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL HER SEEMED ALMOST AMUSING YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER IN ACTION YET SAID MERCER GRIMLY
8088-284756-0070 THEN WITH ALL THREE OF THE DEVICES HE CALLED ANTENNAE IN HIS HAND THEIR LEADS PLUGGED INTO THE CONTROL PANEL HE LED THE WAY TO THE SIDE OF THE POOL
8088-284756-0071 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD SEEN HER MOVE IN THIS FASHION SHE SEEMED TO PROPEL HERSELF WITH A SUDDEN MIGHTY THRUST OF HER FEET AGAINST THE BOTTOM SHE DARTED THROUGH THE WATER WITH THE SPEED OF AN ARROW YET STOPPED AS GENTLY AS THOUGH SHE HAD MERELY FLOATED THERE
8088-284756-0072 AS SHE LOOKED UP HER EYES UNMISTAKABLY SOUGHT MINE AND HER SMILE SEEMED WARM AND INVITING SHE MADE AGAIN THAT STRANGE LITTLE GESTURE OF INVITATION WITH AN EFFORT I GLANCED AT MERCER
8088-284756-0073 THERE WAS SOMETHING DEVILISHLY FASCINATING ABOUT THE GIRL'S GREAT DARK SEARCHING EYES I'M GOING IN I SAID HOARSELY
8088-284756-0074 I HEADED DIRECTLY TOWARDS THE HEAVY BRONZE LADDER THAT LED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL I HAD TWO REASONS IN MIND I WOULD NEED SOMETHING TO KEEP ME UNDER WATER WITH MY LUNGS FULL OF AIR AND I COULD GET OUT QUICKLY IF IT WERE NECESSARY
8088-284756-0075 I HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THE LIVID JAGGED FURROWS IN MERCER'S SIDE QUICKLY AS I SHOT TO THE LADDER SHE WAS THERE BEFORE ME A DIM WAVERING WHITE SHAPE WAITING I PAUSED HOLDING TO A RUNG OF THE LADDER WITH ONE HAND
8088-284756-0076 SHE CAME CLOSER WALKING WITH THE AIRY GRACE I HAD NOTED BEFORE AND MY HEART POUNDED AGAINST MY RIBS AS SHE RAISED ONE LONG SLIM ARM TOWARDS ME
8088-284756-0077 PERHAPS I THOUGHT QUICKLY THIS WAS WITH HER A SIGN OF GREETING I LIFTED MY OWN ARM AND RETURNED THE SALUTATION IF SALUTATION IT WERE AWARE OF A STRANGE RISING AND FALLING SOUND AS OF A DISTANT HUMMING IN MY EARS
8088-284756-0078 THE SOUND CEASED SUDDENLY ON A RISING NOTE AS THOUGH OF INQUIRY AND IT DAWNED ON ME THAT I HAD HEARD THE SPEECH OF THIS STRANGE CREATURE BEFORE I COULD THINK OF A COURSE OF ACTION MY ACHING LUNGS REMINDED ME OF THE NEED OF AIR
8088-284756-0079 AND I RELEASED MY HOLD ON THE LADDER AND LET MY BODY RISE TO THE SURFACE
8088-284756-0080 I LOOKED DOWN THE GIRL WAS WATCHING ME AND THERE WAS NO SMILE ON HER FACE NOW
8088-284756-0081 AS HER FACE CAME CLOSE TO MY OWN I BECAME AWARE OF THE HUMMING CROONING SOUND I HAD HEARD BEFORE LOUDER THIS TIME
8088-284756-0082 I SMILED BACK AT HER AND SHOOK MY HEAD
8088-284756-0083 I POINTED UPWARD FOR I WAS FEELING THE NEED FOR FRESH AIR AGAIN AND SLOWLY MOUNTED THE LADDER THIS TIME SHE DID NOT GRASP ME BUT WATCHED ME INTENTLY AS THOUGH UNDERSTANDING WHAT I DID AND THE REASONS FOR IT
8088-284756-0084 BRING ONE OF YOUR GADGETS OVER HERE MERCER I CALLED ACROSS THE POOL I THINK I'M MAKING PROGRESS GOOD BOY HE CRIED AND CAME RUNNING WITH TWO OF THE ANTENNAE THE LONG INSULATED CORDS TRAILING BEHIND HIM THROUGH THE WATER THE GIRL WATCHED HIM EVIDENT DISLIKE IN HER EYES
8088-284756-0085 THE SALT WATER WOULD SHORT THE ANTENNAE YOU SEE TRY TO GET HER TO WEAR ONE AND THEN YOU GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF WATER AND DON YOURS AND REMEMBER SHE WON'T BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH US BY WORDS WE'LL HAVE TO GET HER TO CONVEY HER THOUGHTS BY MEANS OF MENTAL PICTURES
8088-284756-0086 I'LL TRY TO IMPRESS THAT ON HER UNDERSTAND I NODDED AND PICKED UP ONE OF THE INSTRUMENTS FIRE WHEN READY GRIDLEY I COMMENTED AND SANK AGAIN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL I TOUCHED THE GIRL'S HEAD WITH ONE FINGER AND THEN POINTED TO MY OWN HEAD
8088-284756-0087 TRYING TO CONVEY TO HER THAT SHE COULD GET HER THOUGHTS TO ME THEN I HELD UP THE ANTENNAE AND PLACED IT ON MY OWN HEAD TO SHOW THAT IT COULD NOT HARM HER MY NEXT MOVE WAS TO OFFER HER THE INSTRUMENT MOVING SLOWLY AND SMILING REASSURINGLY
8088-284756-0088 NO MEAN FEAT UNDER WATER SHE HESITATED A MOMENT AND THEN HER EYES FIXED ON MINE
8088-284756-0089 I SMILED AND NODDED AND PRESSED HER SHOULDER IN TOKEN OF FRIENDLY GREETING THEN GESTURING TOWARD MY OWN HEAD AGAIN AND POINTING UPWARD I CLIMBED THE LADDER ALL RIGHT MERCER I SHOUTED START AT ONCE BEFORE SHE GROWS RESTLESS
8088-284756-0090 I'VE ALREADY STARTED HE CALLED BACK AND I HURRIEDLY DONNED MY OWN INSTRUMENT
8088-284756-0091 SO THAT MY HEAD REMAINED OUT OF WATER AND SMILED DOWN AT THE GIRL TOUCHING THE INSTRUMENT ON MY HEAD AND THEN POINTING TO HERS I COULD SENSE MERCER'S THOUGHTS NOW HE WAS PICTURING HIMSELF WALKING LONG THE SHORE WITH THE STORMY OCEAN IN THE BACKGROUND
8088-284756-0092 I SAW HIM RUN UP TO THE POOL AND LIFT THE SLIM PALE FIGURE IN HIS ARMS
8088-284756-0093 I VISUALIZED THEM JUST AS I COULD CLOSE MY EYES AND VISUALIZE FOR EXAMPLE THE FIREPLACE IN THE LIVING ROOM OF MY OWN HOME I LOOKED DOWN AT THE GIRL SHE WAS FROWNING AND HER EYES WERE VERY WIDE
8088-284756-0094 HER HEAD WAS A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE IN THE ATTITUDE OF ONE WHO LISTENS INTENTLY SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY MERCER THOUGHT OUT THE WHOLE STORY OF HIS EXPERIENCES WITH THE GIRL UNTIL SHE HAD PLUNGED INTO THE POOL THEN I SAW AGAIN THE BEACH
8088-284756-0095 I WAS AWARE OF THE SOFT LITTLE TICK IN THE CENTER OF MY BRAIN THAT ANNOUNCED THAT THE SWITCH HAD BEEN MOVED TO ANOTHER CONTACT POINT I GLANCED DOWN AT HER SHE WAS STARING UP AT ME WITH HER GREAT CURIOUS EYES
8088-284756-0096 AND I SENSED THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE INSTRUMENT I WORE THAT SHE WAS THINKING OF ME I SAW MY OWN FEATURES IDEALIZED GLOWING WITH A STRANGE BEAUTY THAT WAS CERTAINLY NONE OF MY OWN I REALIZED THAT I SAW MYSELF IN SHORT AS SHE SAW ME
8088-284756-0097 A DIM BLUISH LIGHT FILTERED DOWN ON A SCENE SUCH AS MORTAL EYES HAVE NEVER SEEN ALL AROUND WERE STRANGE STRUCTURES OF JAGGED CORAL ROUGHLY CIRCULAR AS TO BASE AND ROUNDED ON TOP RESEMBLING VERY MUCH THE IGLOOS OF THE ESKIMOS
8088-284756-0098 THE STRUCTURES VARIED GREATLY IN SIZE AND SEEMED TO BE ARRANGED IN SOME SORT OF REGULAR ORDER LIKE HOUSES ALONG A NARROW STREET
8088-284756-0099 AROUND MANY OF THEM GREW CLUSTERS OF STRANGE AND COLORFUL SEAWEEDS THAT WAVED THEIR BANNERS GENTLY AS THOUGH SOME IMPERCEPTIBLE CURRENT DALLIED WITH THEM IN PASSING HERE AND THERE FIGURES MOVED SLIM WHITE FIGURES THAT STROLLED ALONG THE NARROW STREET
8088-284756-0100 OR AT TIMES SHOT OVERHEAD LIKE VERITABLE TORPEDOES THERE WERE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN MOVING THERE THE MEN WERE BROADER OF SHOULDER AND THEIR HAIR WHICH THEY WORE TO THEIR KNEES WAS SOMEWHAT DARKER IN COLOR THAN THAT OF THE WOMEN BOTH SEXES WERE SLIM
8088-284756-0101 AND THERE WAS A REMARKABLE UNIFORMITY OF SIZE AND APPEARANCE NONE OF THE STRANGE BEINGS WORE GARMENTS OF ANY KIND NOR WERE THEY NECESSARY
8088-284756-0102 THE CLINGING TRESSES WERE CINCTURED AT THE WAIST WITH A SORT OF CORD OF TWISTED ORANGE COLORED MATERIAL AND SOME OF THE YOUNGER WOMEN WORE BANDS OF THE SAME MATERIAL AROUND THEIR BROWS NEAREST OF ALL THE FIGURES WAS THE GIRL WHO WAS VISUALIZING ALL THIS FOR US
8088-284756-0103 SHE WAS WALKING SLOWLY AWAY FROM THE CLUSTER OF CORAL STRUCTURES ONCE OR TWICE SHE PAUSED AND SEEMED TO HOLD CONVERSATION WITH OTHERS OF THE STRANGE PEOPLE BUT EACH TIME SHE MOVED ON THE CORAL STRUCTURES GREW SMALLER AND POORER
8088-284756-0104 FINALLY THE GIRL TROD ALONE ON THE FLOOR OF THE OCEAN BETWEEN GREAT GROWTHS OF KELP AND SEAWEEDS WITH DIM LOOMING MASSES OF FAINTLY TINTED CORAL EVERYWHERE ONCE SHE PASSED CLOSE TO A TILTED RAGGED HULK OF SOME ANCIENT VESSEL
8088-284756-0105 ITS NAKED RIBS PACKED WITH DRIFTED SAND SAUNTERING DREAMILY SHE MOVED AWAY FROM THE ANCIENT DERELICT SUDDENLY A DIM SHADOW SWEPT ACROSS THE SAND AT HER FEET AND SHE ARROWED FROM THE SPOT LIKE A WHITE SLIM METEOR
8088-284756-0106 BUT BEHIND HER DARTED A BLACK AND SWIFTER SHADOW A SHARK LIKE A FLASH SHE TURNED AND FACED THE MONSTER SOMETHING SHE HAD DRAWN FROM HER GIRDLE SHONE PALELY IN HER HAND IT WAS A KNIFE OF WHETTED STONE OR BONE
8088-284756-0107 THE WHITE FIGURE OF THE GIRL SHOT ONWARD THROUGH THE SCARLET FLOOD BLINDED SHE DID NOT SEE THAT THE JUTTING RIBS OF THE ANCIENT SHIP WERE IN HER PATH I SEEMED TO SEE HER CRASH HEAD ON INTO ONE OF THE MASSIVE TIMBERS
8088-284756-0108 AND I CRIED OUT INVOLUNTARILY AND GLANCED DOWN AT THE GIRL IN THE WATER AT MY FEET HER EYES WERE GLOWING SHE KNEW THAT I HAD UNDERSTOOD HAZILY THEN I SEEMED TO VISUALIZE HER BODY FLOATING LIMPLY IN THE WATER IT WAS ALL VERY VAGUE AND INDISTINCT
8088-284756-0109 THE GIRL WAS THINKING OF HER SUFFERING TAKEN OUT OF HER NATIVE ELEMENT
8088-284756-0110 THAT NO DOUBT WAS WHY SHE HATED HIM
8088-284756-0111 ADJUSTED TO HER OWN IDEAS OF WHAT A MAN SHOULD BE I FLUNG THE INSTRUMENT FROM MY HEAD AND DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL I GRIPPED BOTH HER SHOULDERS GENTLY TO EXPRESS MY THANKS AND FRIENDSHIP MY HEART WAS POUNDING
8088-284756-0112 THERE WAS A STRANGE FASCINATION ABOUT THIS GIRL FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA A SUBTLE APPEAL THAT WAS ANSWERED FROM SOME DEEP SUBTERRANEAN CAVERN OF MY BEING I FORGOT FOR THE MOMENT WHO AND WHAT I WAS
8088-284756-0113 HER GREAT WEIRDLY BLUE EYES SEEMED TO BORE INTO MY BRAIN I COULD FEEL THEM THROBBING THERE I FORGOT TIME AND SPACE I SAW ONLY THAT PALE SMILING FACE AND THOSE GREAT DARK EYES
8088-284756-0114 THEN STRANGLING I TORE MYSELF FROM HER EMBRACE AND SHOT TO THE SURFACE COUGHING I CLEARED MY LUNGS OF THE WATER I HAD INHALED I WAS WEAK AND SHAKING WHEN I FINISHED BUT MY HEAD WAS CLEAR THE GRIP OF THE STRANGE FANTASY THAT HAD GRIPPED ME WAS SHAKEN OFF
8088-284756-0115 MERCER WAS BENDING OVER ME SPEAKING SOFTLY I WAS WATCHING OLD MAN HE SAID GENTLY I CAN IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED A MOMENTARY PSYCHIC FUSING OF AN ANCIENT LONG SINCE BROKEN LINK YOU TOGETHER WITH ALL MANKIND CAME UP OUT OF THE SEA
8088-284756-0116 BUT THERE IS NO RETRACING THE WAY I NODDED MY HEAD BOWED ON MY STREAMING CHEST SORRY MERCER I MUTTERED SOMETHING GOT INTO ME THOSE BIG EYES OF HERS SEEMED TO TUG AT THREADS OF MEMORY BURIED I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT
8088-284756-0117 IT HELPED JERK ME BACK TO THE NORMAL YOU'VE GOT YOUR FEET ON THE GROUND AGAIN TAYLOR HE COMMENTED SOOTHINGLY I THINK THERE'S NO DANGER OF YOU LOSING YOUR GRIP ON TERRA FIRMA AGAIN SHALL WE CARRY ON THERE'S MORE YOU'D LIKE TO LEARN THAT YOU THINK SHE CAN GIVE US
8088-284756-0118 I ASKED HESITANTLY I BELIEVE REPLIED MERCER THAT SHE CAN GIVE US THE HISTORY OF HER PEOPLE IF WE CAN ONLY MAKE HER UNDERSTAND WHAT WE WISH GOD IF WE ONLY COULD
8088-284756-0119 WE CAN TRY OLD TIMER I SAID A BIT SHAKENLY MERCER HURRIED BACK TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE POOL AND I ADJUSTED MY HEAD SET AGAIN SMILING DOWN AT THE GIRL
8095-274345-0000 NO SOONER HAD CHARLES TAKEN INTO HIS HANDS THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT THAN HE SHOWED AN IMPATIENCE TO ASSEMBLE THE GREAT COUNCIL OF THE NATION AND HE WOULD GLADLY FOR THE SAKE OF DESPATCH HAVE CALLED TOGETHER THE SAME PARLIAMENT WHICH HAD SITTEN UNDER HIS FATHER
8095-274345-0001 AND WHICH LAY AT THAT TIME UNDER PROROGATION BUT BEING TOLD THAT THIS MEASURE WOULD APPEAR UNUSUAL HE ISSUED WRITS FOR SUMMONING A NEW PARLIAMENT ON THE SEVENTH OF MAY AND IT WAS NOT WITHOUT REGRET THAT THE ARRIVAL OF THE PRINCESS HENRIETTA
8095-274345-0002 UNEXPERIENCED AND IMPOLITIC REGARDED AS SINCERE ALL THE PRAISES AND CARESSES WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN LOADED WHILE ACTIVE IN PROCURING THE RUPTURE WITH THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA AND BESIDES THAT HE LABORED UNDER GREAT NECESSITIES
8095-274345-0003 HE LIGHTLY MENTIONED THE OCCASION WHICH HE HAD FOR SUPPLY HE EMPLOYED NO INTRIGUE TO INFLUENCE THE SUFFRAGES OF THE MEMBERS HE WOULD NOT EVEN ALLOW THE OFFICERS OF THE CROWN WHO HAD SEATS IN THE HOUSE
8095-274345-0004 AND THAT GREAT ANTICIPATIONS WERE LIKEWISE MADE ON THE REVENUES OF THE CROWN THEY WERE NOT IGNORANT THAT CHARLES WAS LOADED WITH A LARGE DEBT CONTRACTED BY HIS FATHER WHO HAD BORROWED MONEY BOTH FROM HIS OWN SUBJECTS AND FROM FOREIGN PRINCES
8095-274345-0005 THEY HAD LEARNED BY EXPERIENCE THAT THE PUBLIC REVENUE COULD WITH DIFFICULTY MAINTAIN THE DIGNITY OF THE CROWN EVEN UNDER THE ORDINARY CHARGES OF GOVERNMENT
8095-274345-0006 THEY WERE SENSIBLE THAT THE PRESENT WAR WAS VERY LATELY THE RESULT OF THEIR OWN IMPORTUNATE APPLICATIONS AND ENTREATIES AND THAT THEY HAD SOLEMNLY ENGAGED TO SUPPORT THEIR SOVEREIGN IN THE MANAGEMENT OF IT
8095-274345-0007 THEY WERE ACQUAINTED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF MILITARY ENTERPRISES DIRECTED AGAINST THE WHOLE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA AGAINST THE KING OF SPAIN POSSESSED OF THE GREATEST RICHES AND MOST EXTENSIVE DOMINIONS OF ANY PRINCE IN EUROPE
8095-274345-0008 AGAINST THE EMPEROR FERDINAND HITHERTO THE MOST FORTUNATE MONARCH OF HIS AGE WHO HAD SUBDUED AND ASTONISHED GERMANY BY THE RAPIDITY OF HIS VICTORIES DEEP IMPRESSIONS THEY SAW MUST BE MADE BY THE ENGLISH SWORD
8095-274345-0009 AND A VIGOROUS OFFENSIVE WAR BE WAGED AGAINST THESE MIGHTY POTENTATES ERE THEY WOULD RESIGN A PRINCIPALITY WHICH THEY HAD NOW FULLY SUBDUED AND WHICH THEY HELD IN SECURE POSSESSION BY ITS BEING SURROUNDED WITH ALL THEIR OTHER TERRITORIES
8095-274345-0010 TO ANSWER THEREFORE ALL THESE GREAT AND IMPORTANT ENDS TO SATISFY THEIR YOUNG KING IN THE FIRST REQUEST WHICH HE MADE THEM TO PROVE THEIR SENSE OF THE MANY ROYAL VIRTUES PARTICULARLY ECONOMY WITH WHICH CHARLES WAS ENDUED
8095-274345-0011 THE HOUSE OF COMMONS CONDUCTED BY THE WISEST AND ABLEST SENATORS THAT HAD EVER FLOURISHED IN ENGLAND THOUGHT PROPER TO CONFER ON THE KING A SUPPLY OF TWO SUBSIDIES
8095-274345-0012 WHICH THE PRESENT CONJUNCTURE COULD SUGGEST TO THEM IT IS NOT TO BE DOUBTED BUT SPLEEN AND ILL WILL AGAINST THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM HAD AN INFLUENCE WITH MANY SO VAST AND RAPID A FORTUNE SO LITTLE MERITED
8095-274345-0013 COULD NOT FAIL TO EXCITE PUBLIC ENVY AND HOWEVER MEN'S HATRED MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED FOR A MOMENT WHILE THE DUKE'S CONDUCT SEEMED TO GRATIFY THEIR PASSIONS AND THEIR PREJUDICES IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM LONG TO PRESERVE THE AFFECTIONS OF THE PEOPLE
8095-274345-0014 HIS INFLUENCE OVER THE MODESTY OF CHARLES EXCEEDED EVEN THAT WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED OVER THE WEAKNESS OF JAMES NOR WAS ANY PUBLIC MEASURE CONDUCTED BUT BY HIS COUNSEL AND DIRECTION
8095-274345-0015 HIS VEHEMENT TEMPER PROMPTED HIM TO RAISE SUDDENLY TO THE HIGHEST ELEVATION HIS FLATTERERS AND DEPENDANTS AND UPON THE LEAST OCCASION OF DISPLEASURE HE THREW THEM DOWN WITH EQUAL IMPETUOSITY AND VIOLENCE IMPLACABLE IN HIS HATRED
8095-274345-0016 FICKLE IN HIS FRIENDSHIPS ALL MEN WERE EITHER REGARDED AS HIS ENEMIES OR DREADED SOON TO BECOME SUCH THE WHOLE POWER OF THE KINGDOM WAS GRASPED BY HIS INSATIABLE HAND WHILE HE BOTH ENGROSSED THE ENTIRE CONFIDENCE OF HIS MASTER
8095-274345-0017 AND HELD INVESTED IN HIS SINGLE PERSON THE MOST CONSIDERABLE OFFICES OF THE CROWN HOWEVER THE ILL HUMOR OF THE COMMONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN INCREASED BY THESE CONSIDERATIONS WE ARE NOT TO SUPPOSE THEM THE SOLE MOTIVES
8095-274345-0018 THE LAST PARLIAMENT OF JAMES AMIDST ALL THEIR JOY AND FESTIVITY HAD GIVEN HIM A SUPPLY VERY DISPROPORTIONED TO HIS DEMAND AND TO THE OCCASION AND AS EVERY HOUSE OF COMMONS WHICH WAS ELECTED DURING FORTY YEARS
8095-274345-0019 SUCCEEDED TO ALL THE PASSIONS AND PRINCIPLES OF THEIR PREDECESSORS WE OUGHT RATHER TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS OBSTINACY FROM THE GENERAL SITUATION OF THE KINGDOM DURING THAT WHOLE PERIOD THAN FROM ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ATTENDED THIS PARTICULAR CONJUNCTURE
8095-274345-0020 THE NATION WAS VERY LITTLE ACCUSTOMED AT THAT TIME TO THE BURDEN OF TAXES AND HAD NEVER OPENED THEIR PURSES IN ANY DEGREE FOR SUPPORTING THEIR SOVEREIGN EVEN ELIZABETH NOTWITHSTANDING HER VIGOR AND FRUGALITY
8095-274345-0021 AND THE NECESSARY WARS IN WHICH SHE WAS ENGAGED HAD REASON TO COMPLAIN OF THE COMMONS IN THIS PARTICULAR NOR COULD THE AUTHORITY OF THAT PRINCESS WHICH WAS OTHERWISE ALMOST ABSOLUTE EVER EXTORT FROM THEM THE REQUISITE SUPPLIES
8095-274345-0022 WOULD NOT AUGMENT THEIR NUMBER IN THE SAME PROPORTION THE PURITANICAL PARTY THOUGH DISGUISED HAD A GREAT AUTHORITY OVER THE KINGDOM AND MANY OF THE LEADERS AMONG THE COMMONS HAD SECRETLY EMBRACED THE RIGID TENETS OF THAT SECT
8095-274345-0023 ALL THESE WERE DISGUSTED WITH THE COURT BOTH BY THE PREVALENCE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF CIVIL LIBERTY ESSENTIAL TO THEIR PARTY AND ON ACCOUNT OF THE RESTRAINT UNDER WHICH THEY WERE HELD BY THE ESTABLISHED HIERARCHY
8095-274345-0024 IN ORDER TO FORTIFY HIMSELF AGAINST THE RESENTMENT OF JAMES BUCKINGHAM HAD AFFECTED POPULARITY AND ENTERED INTO THE CABALS OF THE PURITANS BUT BEING SECURE OF THE CONFIDENCE OF CHARLES HE HAD SINCE ABANDONED THIS PARTY
8095-274345-0025 AND ON THAT ACCOUNT WAS THE MORE EXPOSED TO THEIR HATRED AND RESENTMENT THOUGH THE RELIGIOUS SCHEMES OF MANY OF THE PURITANS WHEN EXPLAINED APPEAR PRETTY FRIVOLOUS WE ARE NOT THENCE TO IMAGINE THAT THEY WERE PURSUED BY NONE BUT PERSONS OF WEAK UNDERSTANDINGS
8095-274345-0026 THE MATCH WITH FRANCE AND THE ARTICLES IN FAVOR OF CATHOLICS WHICH WERE SUSPECTED TO BE IN THE TREATY WERE LIKEWISE CAUSES OF DISGUST TO THIS WHOLE PARTY
8095-274345-0027 THOUGH IT MUST BE REMARKED THAT THE CONNECTIONS WITH THAT CROWN WERE MUCH LESS OBNOXIOUS TO THE PROTESTANTS AND LESS AGREEABLE TO THE CATHOLICS THAN THE ALLIANCE FORMERLY PROJECTED WITH SPAIN AND WERE THEREFORE RECEIVED RATHER WITH PLEASURE THAN DISSATISFACTION
8095-274345-0028 AS BY THE HARDSHIPS WHICH SOME OF THEM HAD UNDERGONE IN PROSECUTION OF THEM AMONG THESE WE MAY MENTION THE NAMES OF SIR EDWARD COKE SIR EDWIN SANDYS SIR ROBERT PHILIPS SIR FRANCIS SEYMOUR
8095-274345-0029 SIR DUDLEY DIGGES SIR JOHN ELLIOT SIR THOMAS WENTWORTH MISTER SELDEN AND MISTER PYM ANIMATED WITH A WARM REGARD TO LIBERTY
8095-274345-0030 OF REDUCING THE PREROGATIVE WITHIN MORE REASONABLE COMPASS THOUGH THEIR ANCESTORS HAD BLINDLY GIVEN WAY TO PRACTICES AND PRECEDENTS FAVORABLE TO KINGLY POWER AND HAD BEEN ABLE NOTWITHSTANDING TO PRESERVE SOME SMALL REMAINS OF LIBERTY
8095-274345-0031 IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THEY THOUGHT WHEN ALL THESE PRETENSIONS WERE METHODISED AND PROSECUTED BY THE INCREASING KNOWLEDGE OF THE AGE TO MAINTAIN ANY SHADOW OF POPULAR GOVERNMENT IN OPPOSITION TO SUCH UNLIMITED AUTHORITY IN THE SOVEREIGN
8095-274345-0032 IT WAS NECESSARY TO FIX A CHOICE EITHER TO ABANDON ENTIRELY THE PRIVILEGES OF THE PEOPLE OR TO SECURE THEM BY FIRMER AND MORE PRECISE BARRIERS THAN THE CONSTITUTION HAD HITHERTO PROVIDED FOR THEM IN THIS DILEMMA
8095-274345-0033 MEN OF SUCH ASPIRING GENIUSES AND SUCH INDEPENDENT FORTUNES COULD NOT LONG DELIBERATE THEY BOLDLY EMBRACED THE SIDE OF FREEDOM AND RESOLVED TO GRANT NO SUPPLIES TO THEIR NECESSITOUS PRINCE WITHOUT EXTORTING CONCESSIONS IN FAVOR OF CIVIL LIBERTY
8095-274345-0034 THE END THEY ESTEEMED BENEFICENT AND NOBLE THE MEANS REGULAR AND CONSTITUTIONAL TO GRANT OR REFUSE SUPPLIES WAS THE UNDOUBTED PRIVILEGE OF THE COMMONS AND AS ALL HUMAN GOVERNMENTS PARTICULARLY THOSE OF A MIXED FRAME
8095-274345-0035 ARE IN CONTINUAL FLUCTUATION IT WAS AS NATURAL IN THEIR OPINION AND ALLOWABLE FOR POPULAR ASSEMBLIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FAVORABLE INCIDENTS IN ORDER TO SECURE THE SUBJECT
8095-274346-0000 CHARLES GAVE THEM A GRACIOUS AND A COMPLIANT ANSWER TO ALL THEIR REMONSTRANCES HE WAS HOWEVER IN HIS HEART EXTREMELY AVERSE TO THESE FURIOUS MEASURES
8095-274346-0001 THOUGH A DETERMINED PROTESTANT BY PRINCIPLE AS WELL AS INCLINATION HE HAD ENTERTAINED NO VIOLENT HORROR AGAINST POPERY AND A LITTLE HUMANITY HE THOUGHT WAS DUE BY THE NATION TO THE RELIGION OF THEIR ANCESTORS
8095-274346-0002 AN ABATEMENT OF THE MORE RIGOROUS LAWS WAS ALL HE INTENDED AND HIS ENGAGEMENTS WITH FRANCE NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THEIR REGULAR EXECUTION HAD NEVER BEEN PROMISED OR EXPECTED REQUIRED OF HIM SOME INDULGENCE
8095-274346-0003 BUT SO UNFORTUNATE WAS THIS PRINCE THAT NO MEASURE EMBRACED DURING HIS WHOLE REIGN WAS EVER ATTENDED WITH MORE UNHAPPY AND MORE FATAL CONSEQUENCES
8095-274346-0004 THE EXTREME RAGE AGAINST POPERY WAS A SURE CHARACTERISTIC OF PURITANISM THE HOUSE OF COMMONS DISCOVERED OTHER INFALLIBLE SYMPTOMS OF THE PREVALENCE OF THAT PARTY
8095-274346-0005 THEY PETITIONED THE KING FOR REPLACING SUCH ABLE CLERGY AS HAD BEEN SILENCED FOR WANT OF CONFORMITY TO THE CEREMONIES THEY ALSO ENACTED LAWS FOR THE STRICT OBSERVANCE OF SUNDAY WHICH THE PURITANS AFFECTED TO CALL THE SABBATH
8095-274346-0006 AND WHICH THEY SANCTIFIED BY THE MOST MELANCHOLY INDOLENCE IT IS TO BE REMARKED THAT THE DIFFERENT APPELLATIONS OF THIS FESTIVAL WERE AT THAT TIME KNOWN SYMBOLS OF THE DIFFERENT PARTIES
8095-274346-0007 THE KING FINDING THAT THE PARLIAMENT WAS RESOLVED TO GRANT HIM NO SUPPLY AND WOULD FURNISH HIM WITH NOTHING BUT EMPTY PROTESTATIONS OF DUTY
8095-274346-0008 WAS INTRUSTED WITH THE COMMAND HE SAILED IMMEDIATELY FOR CADIZ AND FOUND THE BAY FULL OF SPANISH SHIPS OF GREAT VALUE HE EITHER NEGLECTED TO ATTACK THESE SHIPS OR ATTEMPTED IT PREPOSTEROUSLY
8095-274346-0009 THE ARMY WAS LANDED AND A FORT TAKEN BUT THE UNDISCIPLINED SOLDIERS FINDING STORE OF WINE COULD NOT BE RESTRAINED FROM THE UTMOST EXCESSES FURTHER STAY APPEARING FRUITLESS THEY WERE REEMBARKED AND THE FLEET PUT TO SEA
8095-274346-0010 WITH AN INTENTION OF INTERCEPTING THE SPANISH GALLEONS BUT THE PLAGUE HAVING SEIZED THE SEAMEN AND SOLDIERS THEY WERE OBLIGED TO ABANDON ALL HOPES OF THIS PRIZE AND RETURN TO ENGLAND LOUD COMPLAINTS WERE MADE AGAINST THE COURT FOR INTRUSTING SO IMPORTANT A COMMAND
8095-274346-0011 WAS OBLIGED AGAIN TO HAVE RECOURSE TO A PARLIAMENT THOUGH THE ILL SUCCESS OF HIS ENTERPRISES DIMINISHED HIS AUTHORITY AND SHOWED EVERY DAY MORE PLAINLY THE IMPRUDENCE OF THE SPANISH WAR THOUGH THE INCREASE OF HIS NECESSITIES
8095-274346-0012 RENDERED HIM MORE DEPENDENT AND MORE EXPOSED TO THE ENCROACHMENTS OF THE COMMONS HE WAS RESOLVED TO TRY ONCE MORE THAT REGULAR AND CONSTITUTIONAL EXPEDIENT FOR SUPPLY PERHAPS TOO A LITTLE POLITICAL ART WHICH AT THAT TIME HE PRACTISED
8095-274346-0013 WAS MUCH TRUSTED TO HE HAD NAMED FOUR POPULAR LEADERS SHERIFFS OF COUNTIES SIR EDWARD COKE SIR ROBERT PHILIPS SIR THOMAS WENTWORTH AND SIR FRANCIS SEYMOUR AND THOUGH THE QUESTION HAD BEEN FORMERLY MUCH CONTESTED
8095-274346-0014 HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD BY THAT MEANS INCAPACITATED THEM FROM BEING ELECTED MEMBERS BUT HIS INTENTION BEING SO EVIDENT RATHER PUT THE COMMONS MORE UPON THEIR GUARD
8095-274346-0015 ENOW OF PATRIOTS STILL REMAINED TO KEEP UP THE ILL HUMOR OF THE HOUSE AND MEN NEEDED BUT LITTLE INSTRUCTION OR RHETORIC TO RECOMMEND TO THEM PRACTICES
8095-274346-0016 THE SUM WAS LITTLE PROPORTIONED TO THE GREATNESS OF THE OCCASION AND ILL FITTED TO PROMOTE THOSE VIEWS OF SUCCESS AND GLORY FOR WHICH THE YOUNG PRINCE IN HIS FIRST ENTERPRISE SO ARDENTLY LONGED BUT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WAS NOT THE MOST DISAGREEABLE ONE
8095-274346-0017 THE SUPPLY WAS ONLY VOTED BY THE COMMONS THE PASSING OF THAT VOTE INTO A LAW WAS RESERVED TILL THE END OF THE SESSION A CONDITION WAS THEREBY MADE IN A VERY UNDISGUISED MANNER WITH THEIR SOVEREIGN
8095-274346-0018 UNDER COLOR OF REDRESSING GRIEVANCES WHICH DURING THIS SHORT REIGN COULD NOT BE VERY NUMEROUS THEY WERE TO PROCEED IN REGULATING AND CONTROLLING EVERY PART OF GOVERNMENT WHICH DISPLEASED THEM
8095-274346-0019 AND IF THE KING EITHER CUT THEM SHORT IN THIS UNDERTAKING OR REFUSED COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR DEMANDS HE MUST NOT EXPECT ANY SUPPLY FROM THE COMMONS GREAT DISSATISFACTION WAS EXPRESSED BY CHARLES AT A TREATMENT WHICH HE DEEMED SO HARSH AND UNDUTIFUL
8095-274346-0020 BUT HIS URGENT NECESSITIES OBLIGED HIM TO SUBMIT
8095-274346-0021 HAD EXPRESSED ALL DUTY AND OBEDIENCE IN EXPECTATION THAT AN OPPORTUNITY WOULD OFFER OF REINSTATING HIMSELF IN HIS FORMER CREDIT AND AUTHORITY EVEN AFTER CHARLES'S ACCESSION HE DESPAIRED NOT
8095-274346-0022 HE SUBMITTED TO THE KING'S COMMANDS OF REMAINING AT HIS COUNTRY SEAT AND OF ABSENTING HIMSELF FROM PARLIAMENT MANY TRIALS HE MADE TO REGAIN THE GOOD OPINION OF HIS MASTER
8095-274346-0023 BUT FINDING THEM ALL FRUITLESS AND OBSERVING CHARLES TO BE ENTIRELY GOVERNED BY BUCKINGHAM HIS IMPLACABLE ENEMY HE RESOLVED NO LONGER TO KEEP ANY MEASURES WITH THE COURT A NEW SPIRIT HE SAW AND A NEW POWER ARISING IN THE NATION
8095-274346-0024 AND TO THESE HE WAS DETERMINED FOR THE FUTURE TO TRUST FOR HIS SECURITY AND PROTECTION WHEN THE PARLIAMENT WAS SUMMONED CHARLES BY A STRETCH OF PREROGATIVE HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT NO WRIT AS IS CUSTOMARY SHOULD BE SENT TO BRISTOL
8095-274346-0025 THAT NOBLEMAN APPLIED TO THE HOUSE OF LORDS BY PETITION AND CRAVED THEIR GOOD OFFICES WITH THE KING FOR OBTAINING WHAT WAS HIS DUE AS A PEER OF THE REALM HIS WRIT WAS SENT HIM BUT ACCOMPANIED WITH A LETTER FROM THE LORD KEEPER COVENTRY
8095-274346-0026 COMMANDING HIM IN THE KING'S NAME TO ABSENT HIMSELF FROM PARLIAMENT THIS LETTER BRISTOL CONVEYED TO THE LORDS AND ASKED ADVICE HOW TO PROCEED IN SO DELICATE A SITUATION
8095-274346-0027 THE KING'S PROHIBITION WAS WITHDRAWN AND BRISTOL TOOK HIS SEAT PROVOKED AT THESE REPEATED INSTANCES OF VIGOR WHICH THE COURT DENOMINATED CONTUMACY CHARLES ORDERED HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL TO ENTER AN ACCUSATION OF HIGH TREASON AGAINST HIM
8095-274346-0028 BY WAY OF RECRIMINATION BRISTOL ACCUSED BUCKINGHAM OF HIGH TREASON BOTH THE EARL'S DEFENCE OF HIMSELF AND ACCUSATION OF THE DUKE REMAIN AND TOGETHER WITH SOME ORIGINAL LETTERS STILL EXTANT
8095-274346-0029 OF DELIVERING SHIPS TO THE FRENCH KING IN ORDER TO SERVE AGAINST THE HUGONOTS OF BEING EMPLOYED IN THE SALE OF HONORS AND OFFICES OF ACCEPTING EXTENSIVE GRANTS FROM THE CROWN OF PROCURING MANY TITLES OF HONOR FOR HIS KINDRED
8095-274346-0030 AND OF ADMINISTERING PHYSIC TO THE LATE KING WITHOUT ACQUAINTING HIS PHYSICIANS ALL THESE ARTICLES APPEAR FROM COMPARING THE ACCUSATION AND REPLY TO BE EITHER FRIVOLOUS OR FALSE OR BOTH
8095-274346-0031 THE ONLY CHARGE WHICH COULD BE REGARDED AS IMPORTANT WAS THAT HE HAD EXTORTED A SUM OF TEN THOUSAND POUNDS FROM THE EAST INDIA COMPANY AND THAT HE HAD CONFISCATED SOME GOODS BELONGING TO FRENCH MERCHANTS ON PRETENCE OF THEIR BEING THE PROPERTY OF SPANISH
8095-274346-0032 SO THAT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO GIVE A DECISIVE OPINION WITH REGARD TO THESE ARTICLES
8095-274346-0033 BUT SO RIVETTED THROUGHOUT THE NATION WERE THE PREJUDICES WITH REGARD TO SPANISH DECEIT AND FALSEHOOD THAT VERY FEW OF THE COMMONS SEEM AS YET TO HAVE BEEN CONVINCED THAT THEY HAD BEEN SEDUCED BY BUCKINGHAM'S NARRATIVE
8095-274346-0034 A CERTAIN PROOF THAT A DISCOVERY OF THIS NATURE WAS NOT AS IS IMAGINED BY SEVERAL HISTORIANS
8095-274346-0035 THE KING SEEMED DESIROUS OF EMBRACING EVERY OPPORTUNITY BY WHICH HE COULD EXPRESS A CONTEMPT AND DISREGARD FOR THEM NO ONE WAS AT THAT TIME SUFFICIENTLY SENSIBLE OF THE GREAT WEIGHT WHICH THE COMMONS BORE IN THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION
8095-274346-0036 THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND HAD NEVER HITHERTO AFFORDED ONE INSTANCE WHERE ANY GREAT MOVEMENT OR REVOLUTION HAD PROCEEDED FROM THE LOWER HOUSE AND AS THEIR RANK BOTH CONSIDERED IN A BODY AND AS INDIVIDUALS WAS BUT THE SECOND IN THE KINGDOM
8095-274346-0037 NOTHING LESS THAN FATAL EXPERIENCE COULD ENGAGE THE ENGLISH PRINCES TO PAY A DUE REGARD TO THE INCLINATIONS OF THAT FORMIDABLE ASSEMBLY THE EARL OF SUFFOLK CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE DYING ABOUT THIS TIME
8095-274346-0038 BUCKINGHAM THOUGH LYING UNDER IMPEACHMENT WAS YET BY MEANS OF COURT INTEREST CHOSEN IN HIS PLACE THE COMMONS RESENTED AND LOUDLY COMPLAINED OF THIS AFFRONT AND THE MORE TO ENRAGE THEM THE KING HIMSELF WROTE A LETTER TO THE UNIVERSITY EXTOLLING THE DUKE
8095-274346-0039 YET LEST ANY AMBIGUITY SHOULD REMAIN SIR DUDLEY CARLETON VICE CHAMBERLAIN TOOK CARE TO EXPLAIN IT I PRAY YOU CONSIDER SAID HE WHAT THESE NEW COUNSELS ARE OR MAY BE I FEAR TO DECLARE THOSE THAT I CONCEIVE
8095-274346-0040 IN ALL CHRISTIAN KINGDOMS YOU KNOW THAT PARLIAMENTS WERE IN USE ANCIENTLY BY WHICH THOSE KINGDOMS WERE GOVERNED IN A MOST FLOURISHING MANNER UNTIL THE MONARCHS BEGAN TO KNOW THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND SEEING THE TURBULENT SPIRIT OF THEIR PARLIAMENTS AT LENGTH
8095-274346-0041 THEY BY LITTLE AND LITTLE BEGAN TO STAND ON THEIR PREROGATIVES AND AT LAST OVERTHREW THE PARLIAMENTS THROUGHOUT CHRISTENDOM
8095-274346-0042 WHICH BRINGETH SUCH HAPPINESS TO THIS NATION AND MAKES US ENVIED OF ALL OTHERS WHILE THERE IS THIS SWEETNESS BETWEEN HIS MAJESTY AND THE COMMONS LEST WE LOSE THE REPUTE OF A FREE PEOPLE BY OUR TURBULENCY IN PARLIAMENT
8095-274346-0043 THESE IMPRUDENT SUGGESTIONS RATHER GAVE WARNING THAN STRUCK TERROR A PRECARIOUS LIBERTY THE COMMONS THOUGHT WHICH WAS TO BE PRESERVED BY UNLIMITED COMPLAISANCE WAS NO LIBERTY AT ALL AND IT WAS NECESSARY WHILE YET IN THEIR POWER
8095-274346-0044 TO SECURE THE CONSTITUTION BY SUCH INVINCIBLE BARRIERS THAT NO KING OR MINISTER SHOULD EVER FOR THE FUTURE DARE TO SPEAK SUCH A LANGUAGE TO ANY PARLIAMENT OR EVEN ENTERTAIN SUCH A PROJECT AGAINST THEM
8095-274346-0045 THE COMMONS IMMEDIATELY DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD PROCEED NO FURTHER UPON BUSINESS TILL THEY HAD SATISFACTION IN THEIR PRIVILEGES CHARLES ALLEGED AS THE REASON OF THIS MEASURE CERTAIN SEDITIOUS EXPRESSIONS WHICH HE SAID HAD IN THEIR ACCUSATION OF THE DUKE
8095-274346-0046 DROPPED FROM THESE MEMBERS UPON INQUIRY IT APPEARED THAT NO SUCH EXPRESSIONS HAD BEEN USED THE MEMBERS WERE RELEASED AND THE KING REAPED NO OTHER BENEFIT FROM THIS ATTEMPT THAN TO EXASPERATE THE HOUSE STILL
8095-274346-0047 AND TO SHOW SOME DEGREE OF PRECIPITANCY AND INDISCRETION MOVED BY THIS EXAMPLE THE HOUSE OF PEERS WERE ROUSED FROM THEIR INACTIVITY AND CLAIMED LIBERTY FOR THE EARL OF ARUNDEL WHO HAD BEEN LATELY CONFINED IN THE TOWER
8095-274346-0048 AFTER MANY FRUITLESS EVASIONS THE KING
8095-274346-0049 HIS MOTHER WHO HAD GREAT INFLUENCE OVER HIM WAS A PROFESSED CATHOLIC HIS WIFE WAS NOT FREE FROM SUSPICION
8095-274346-0050 SO VIOLENT WAS THE BIGOTRY OF THE TIMES THAT IT WAS THOUGHT A SUFFICIENT REASON FOR DISQUALIFYING ANY ONE FROM HOLDING AN OFFICE
8095-274346-0051 THIS ARTICLE TOGETHER WITH THE NEW IMPOSITIONS LAID ON MERCHANDISE BY JAMES CONSTITUTED NEAR HALF OF THE CROWN REVENUES AND BY DEPRIVING THE KING OF THESE RESOURCES THEY WOULD HAVE REDUCED HIM TO TOTAL SUBJECTION AND DEPENDENCE
8095-274346-0052 WHILE THEY RETAINED SUCH A PLEDGE BESIDES THE SUPPLY ALREADY PROMISED THEY WERE SURE THAT NOTHING COULD BE REFUSED THEM THOUGH AFTER CANVASSING THE MATTER NEAR THREE NINTHS THEY FOUND THEMSELVES UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF FIXING ANY LEGAL CRIME UPON THE DUKE
8095-274346-0053 THE SMALLEST APPEARANCE OF GUILT COULD NOT BE FIXED UPON HIM WHAT IDEA HE ASKED MUST ALL MANKIND ENTERTAIN OF HIS HONOR SHOULD HE SACRIFICE HIS INNOCENT FRIEND TO PECUNIARY CONSIDERATIONS WHAT FURTHER AUTHORITY SHOULD HE RETAIN IN THE NATION
8095-274346-0054 WERE HE CAPABLE IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN TO GIVE IN SO SIGNAL AN INSTANCE SUCH MATTER OF TRIUMPH TO HIS ENEMIES AND DISCOURAGEMENT TO HIS ADHERENTS TO DAY THE COMMONS PRETEND TO WREST HIS MINISTER FROM HIM
8095-274346-0055 TO MORROW THEY WILL ATTACK SOME BRANCH OF HIS PREROGATIVE BY THEIR REMONSTRANCES AND PROMISES AND PROTESTATIONS THEY HAD ENGAGED THE CROWN IN A WAR AS SOON AS THEY SAW A RETREAT IMPOSSIBLE
8095-274346-0056 WITHOUT WAITING FOR NEW INCIDENTS WITHOUT COVERING THEMSELVES WITH NEW PRETENCES THEY IMMEDIATELY DESERTED HIM AND REFUSED HIM ALL REASONABLE SUPPLY IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THEY DESIRED NOTHING SO MUCH AS TO SEE HIM PLUNGED IN INEXTRICABLE DIFFICULTIES
8095-274346-0057 OF WHICH THEY INTENDED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE TO SUCH DEEP PERFIDY TO SUCH UNBOUNDED USURPATIONS IT WAS NECESSARY TO OPPOSE A PROPER FIRMNESS AND RESOLUTION
8095-274348-0000 AND WHO FROM A PRIVATE STATION HAD MOUNTED IN THE EARLIEST YOUTH
8095-274348-0001 HE DARED TO CARRY HIS AMBITIOUS ADDRESSES TO THE QUEEN HERSELF AND HE FAILED NOT TO MAKE IMPRESSION ON A HEART NOT UNDISPOSED TO THE TENDER PASSIONS THAT ATTACHMENT AT LEAST OF THE MIND WHICH APPEARS SO DELICIOUS AND IS SO DANGEROUS
8095-274348-0002 SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED BY THE PRINCESS AND THE DUKE PRESUMED SO FAR ON HER GOOD GRACES THAT AFTER HIS DEPARTURE HE SECRETLY RETURNED UPON SOME PRETENCE AND PAYING A VISIT TO THE QUEEN
8095-274348-0003 WAS DISMISSED WITH A REPROOF WHICH SAVORED MORE OF KINDNESS THAN OF ANGER INFORMATION OF THIS CORRESPONDENCE WAS SOON CARRIED TO RICHELIEU THE VIGILANCE OF THAT MINISTER WAS HERE FURTHER ROUSED BY JEALOUSY
8095-274348-0004 HE TOO EITHER FROM VANITY OR POLITICS HAD VENTURED TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO THE QUEEN BUT A PRIEST PAST MIDDLE AGE OF A SEVERE CHARACTER AND OCCUPIED IN THE MOST EXTENSIVE PLANS OF AMBITION OR VENGEANCE
8095-274348-0005 ENTIRELY DISPOSED TO GAYETY AND GALLANTRY THE CARDINAL'S DISAPPOINTMENT STRONGLY INCLINED HIM TO COUNTERWORK THE AMOROUS PROJECTS OF HIS RIVAL WHEN THE DUKE WAS MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR A NEW EMBASSY TO PARIS
8095-274348-0006 A MESSAGE WAS SENT HIM FROM LOUIS THAT HE MUST NOT THINK OF SUCH A JOURNEY IN A ROMANTIC PASSION HE SWORE THAT HE WOULD SEE THE QUEEN IN SPITE OF ALL THE POWER OF FRANCE
8095-274348-0007 AND FROM THAT MOMENT HE DETERMINED TO ENGAGE ENGLAND IN A WAR WITH THAT KINGDOM HE FIRST TOOK ADVANTAGE OF SOME QUARRELS EXCITED BY THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND'S ATTENDANTS AND HE PERSUADED CHARLES TO DISMISS AT ONCE ALL HER FRENCH SERVANTS
8095-274348-0008 CONTRARY TO THE ARTICLES OF THE MARRIAGE TREATY HE ENCOURAGED THE ENGLISH SHIPS OF WAR AND PRIVATEERS TO SEIZE VESSELS BELONGING TO FRENCH MERCHANTS
8095-274348-0009 AND STRONGLY SOLICITED CHARLES TO EMBRACE THE PROTECTION OF THESE DISTRESSED RELIGIONISTS HE REPRESENTED THAT AFTER THE INHABITANTS OF ROCHELLE HAD BEEN REPRESSED BY THE COMBINED SQUADRONS OF ENGLAND AND HOLLAND
8095-274348-0010 AFTER PEACE WAS CONCLUDED WITH THE FRENCH KING UNDER CHARLES'S MEDIATION THE AMBITIOUS CARDINAL WAS STILL MEDITATING THE DESTRUCTION OF THE HUGONOTS THAT PREPARATIONS WERE SILENTLY MAKING IN EVERY PROVINCE OF FRANCE FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THEIR RELIGION
8095-274348-0011 THAT FORTS WERE ERECTED IN ORDER TO BRIDLE ROCHELLE THE MOST CONSIDERABLE BULWARK OF THE PROTESTANTS THAT THE REFORMED IN FRANCE CAST THEIR EYES ON CHARLES AS THE HEAD OF THEIR FAITH
8095-274348-0012 AND CONSIDERED HIM AS A PRINCE ENGAGED BY INTEREST AS WELL AS INCLINATION TO SUPPORT THEM THAT SO LONG AS THEIR PARTY SUBSISTED CHARLES MIGHT RELY ON THEIR ATTACHMENT AS MUCH AS ON THAT OF HIS OWN SUBJECTS BUT IF THEIR LIBERTIES WERE ONCE RAVISHED FROM THEM
8095-274348-0013 THE POWER OF FRANCE FREED FROM THIS IMPEDIMENT WOULD SOON BECOME FORMIDABLE TO ENGLAND AND TO ALL THE NEIGHBORING NATIONS THOUGH CHARLES PROBABLY BORE BUT SMALL FAVOR TO THE HUGONOTS WHO SO MUCH RESEMBLED THE PURITANS IN DISCIPLINE AND WORSHIP
8095-274348-0014 IN RELIGION AND POLITICS HE YET ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE GAINED BY THESE ARGUMENTS ENFORCED BY THE SOLICITATIONS OF BUCKINGHAM A FLEET OF A HUNDRED SAIL AND AN ARMY OF SEVEN THOUSAND MEN WERE FITTED OUT FOR THE INVASION OF FRANCE
8095-274348-0015 AND BOTH OF THEM INTRUSTED TO THE COMMAND OF THE DUKE WHO WAS ALTOGETHER UNACQUAINTED BOTH WITH LAND AND SEA SERVICE THE FLEET APPEARED BEFORE ROCHELLE BUT SO ILL CONCERTED WERE BUCKINGHAM'S MEASURES THAT THE INHABITANTS OF THAT CITY
8095-274348-0016 SHUT THEIR GATES AND REFUSED TO ADMIT ALLIES OF WHOSE COMING THEY WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY INFORMED
8095-274348-0017 HASTENED THE VENGEANCE OF THEIR MASTER EXHAUSTED THEIR PROVISIONS IN SUPPLYING THEIR ALLIES AND WERE THREATENED WITH AN IMMEDIATE SIEGE
8098-275181-0000 THEIR SHARP CUR LIKE BARKS USED OFTEN TO ROUSE US AND OF A DARK EVENING WE WOULD HEAR THEM OUT IN THE FIELDS MOUSING AROUND THE STONE HEAPS MAKING A QUEER SQUEAKING SOUND LIKE A MOUSE
8098-275181-0001 TO CALL THE REAL MICE OUT OF THEIR GRASS NESTS INSIDE THE STONE HEAPS THIS INDEED IS A FAVORITE TRICK OF REYNARD AT THE TIME OF MY STORY MY FRIEND TOM EDWARDS TEN YEARS OF AGE
8098-275181-0002 AND MYSELF WERE IN THE TURKEY BUSINESS EQUAL PARTNERS WE OWNED A FLOCK OF THIRTY ONE TURKEYS THESE ROOSTED BY NIGHT IN A LARGE BUTTERNUT TREE IN FRONT OF TOM'S HOUSE IN THE VERY TOP OF IT
8098-275181-0003 AND BY DAY THEY WANDERED ABOUT THE EDGES OF THE CLEARINGS IN QUEST OF BEECH NUTS WHICH WERE VERY PLENTIFUL THAT FALL ALL WENT WELL TILL THE LAST WEEK IN OCTOBER WHEN ON TAKING THE CENSUS ONE MORNING A TURKEY WAS FOUND TO BE MISSING
8098-275181-0004 THE THIRTY ONE HAD BECOME THIRTY SINCE NIGHTFALL THE PREVIOUS EVENING IT WAS THE FIRST ONE WE HAD LOST WE PROCEEDED TO LOOK FOR TRACES OUR SUSPICIONS WERE DIVIDED
8098-275181-0005 TOM THOUGHT IT WAS THE TWOMBLY BOYS NEFARIOUS SAM IN PARTICULAR I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN OWL BUT UNDER THE TREE IN THE SOFT DIRT WHERE THE POTATOES HAD RECENTLY BEEN DUG WE FOUND FOX TRACKS
8098-275181-0006 AND TWO OR THREE OMINOUS LITTLE WADS OF FEATHERS WITH ONE LONG TAIL FEATHER ADRIFT THEREUPON WE CONCLUDED THAT THE TURKEY HAD ACCIDENTALLY FALLEN DOWN OUT OF THE BUTTERNUT HAD A FIT PERHAPS
8098-275181-0007 AND A CASUALTY SUCH AS TURKEY RAISERS ARE UNAVOIDABLY HEIRS TO AND WE BORE OUR LOSS WITH RESIGNATION WE WERE GLAD TO REMEMBER THAT TURKEYS DID NOT OFTEN FALL OFF THEIR ROOSTS
8098-275181-0008 THIS THEORY RECEIVED SOMETHING OF A CHECK WHEN OUR FLOCK COUNTED ONLY TWENTY NINE THE NEXT MORNING THERE WERE MORE FOX TRACKS AND A GREAT MANY MORE FEATHERS UNDER THE TREE THIS PUT A NEW AND ALTOGETHER UGLY ASPECT ON THE MATTER
8098-275181-0009 NO ALGEBRA WAS NEEDED TO FIGURE THE OUTCOME OF THE TURKEY BUSINESS AT THIS RATE TOGETHER WITH OUR PROSPECTIVE PROFITS IN THE LIGHT OF THIS NEW FACT IT WAS CLEAR THAT SOMETHING MUST BE DONE AND AT ONCE TOO
8098-275181-0010 OR RUIN WOULD SWALLOW UP THE POULTRY FIRM RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY WE ATTRIBUTED THE MISCHIEF TO A CERTAIN SILVER GRAY THAT HAD SEVERAL TIMES BEEN SEEN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT AUTUMN
8098-275181-0011 IT WOULD TAKE FAR TOO MUCH SPACE TO RELATE IN DETAIL THE PLANS WE LAID AND PUT IN EXECUTION TO CATCH THAT FOX DURING THE NEXT TWO WEEKS I RECOLLECT THAT WE SET THREE TRAPS FOR HIM TO NO PURPOSE
8098-275181-0012 HAD SUCCEEDED IN GETTING TWO MORE OF THE TURKEYS HEROES IT IS SAID ARE BORN OF GREAT CRISES THIS DILEMMA OF OURS DEVELOPED TOM'S GENIUS I'LL HAVE THAT FOX HE SAID WHEN THE TRAPS FAILED
8098-275181-0013 EACH A WAD OF FINE DRY GRASS AS LARGE AS A QUART BOX THESE WERE GATHERED UP AND FILLED THE GREAT BASKET THERE SAID HE TRIUMPHANTLY DON'T THEM SMELL MOUSEY THEY DID CERTAINLY
8098-275181-0014 THEY SAVORED AS STRONGLY OF MICE AS TOM'S QUESTION OF BAD GRAMMAR AND DON'T FOXES CATCH MICE DEMANDED TOM CONFIDENTLY YES BUT I DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S GOING TO CATCH THE FOX I SAID
8098-275181-0015 WELL LOOK HERE THEN I'LL SHOW YE SAID HE
8098-275181-0016 AND YOU WAS PROWLING AROUND THE FIELDS GO OFF NOW OUT THERE BY THAT STUMP FULL OF WONDER AND CURIOSITY I RETIRED TO THE STUMP TOM MEANTIME TURNED OUT THE MASS OF NESTS
8098-275181-0017 AND WITH IT COMPLETELY COVERED HIMSELF THE PILE NOW RESEMBLED AN ENORMOUS MOUSE NEST OR RATHER A SMALL HAY COCK
8098-275181-0018 INSIDE THE NEST EVIDENTLY THERE WERE MICE IN IT AND FEELING MY CHARACTER AS FOX AT STAKE I AT ONCE TROTTED FORWARD THEN CREPT UP AND AS THE RUSTLING AND SQUEAKING CONTINUED MADE A POUNCE INTO THE GRASS
8098-275181-0019 AS I HAD HEARD IT SAID THAT FOXES DID WHEN MOUSING INSTANTLY TWO SPRY BROWN HANDS FROM OUT THE NEST CLUTCHED ME WITH A MOST VENGEFUL GRIP AS A FOX I STRUGGLED TREMENDOUSLY
8098-275181-0020 THEN IN DUMB SHOW KNOCKED MY HEAD WITH A STONE D'YE SEE NOW HE DEMANDED I SAW BUT A FOX WOULD BITE YOU I OBJECTED LET HIM BITE SAID TOM
8098-275181-0021 WITH THE DUSK WE STOLE OUT INTO THE FIELD WHERE THE STONE HEAPS WERE AND WHERE WE HAD OFTENEST HEARD FOXES BARK SELECTING A NOOK IN THE EDGE OF A CLUMP OF RASPBERRY BRIARS WHICH GREW ABOUT A GREAT PINE STUMP
8098-275181-0022 TOM LAY DOWN AND I COVERED HIM UP COMPLETELY WITH THE CONTENTS OF THE BIG BASKET HE THEN PRACTICED SQUEAKING AND RUSTLING SEVERAL TIMES TO BE SURE THAT ALL WAS IN GOOD TRIM HIS SQUEAKS WERE PERFECT SUCCESSES
8098-275181-0023 MADE BY SUCKING THE AIR SHARPLY BETWIXT HIS TEETH NOW BE OFF SAID TOM AND DON'T COME POKING AROUND NOR GET IN SIGHT TILL YOU HEAR ME HOLLER
8098-275181-0024 AND BEING AMIDST NICE COZY STRAW I PRESENTLY WENT TO SLEEP QUITE UNINTENTIONALLY I MUST HAVE SLEPT SOME TIME THOUGH IT SEEMED TO ME BUT A VERY FEW MINUTES WHAT WOKE ME WAS A NOISE A SHARP SUPPRESSED YELP
8098-275181-0025 IT TOOK ME A MOMENT TO UNDERSTAND WHERE I WAS AND WHY I WAS THERE A SOUND OF SCUFFLING AND TUMBLING ON THE GROUND AT SOME DISTANCE ASSISTED MY WANDERING WITS AND I RUSHED OUT OF THE BARN AND RAN TOWARD THE FIELD
8098-275181-0026 AS I RAN TWO OR THREE DULL WHACKS CAME TO MY EAR GOT HIM TOM I SHOUTED RUSHING UP TOM WAS HOLDING AND SQUEEZING ONE OF HIS HANDS WITH THE OTHER AND SHAKING IT VIOLENTLY
8098-275181-0027 HE SAID NOT A WORD AND LEFT ME TO POKE ABOUT AND STUMBLE ON THE LIMP WARM CARCASS OF A LARGE FOX THAT LAY NEAR BITE YE I EXCLAIMED AFTER SATISFYING MYSELF THAT THE FOX WAS DEAD SOME SAID TOM
8098-275181-0028 AND THAT WAS ALL I COULD GET FROM HIM THAT NIGHT WE TOOK THE FOX TO THE HOUSE AND LIGHTED A CANDLE IT WAS THE SILVER GRAY TOM WASHED HIS BITE IN COLD WATER AND WENT TO BED
8098-275181-0029 HIS LEFT HAND WAS BITTEN THROUGH THE PALM AND BADLY SWOLLEN THERE WAS ALSO A DEEP BITE IN THE FLESHY PART OF HIS RIGHT ARM JUST BELOW THE ELBOW SEVERAL MINOR NIPS IN HIS LEFT LEG ABOVE THE KNEE AND A RAGGED GRAB
8098-275181-0030 THESE NUMEROUS BITES HOWEVER WERE FOLLOWED BY NO SERIOUS ILL EFFECTS THE NEXT DAY TOM TOLD ME THAT THE FOX HAD SUDDENLY PLUNGED INTO THE GRASS THAT HE HAD CAUGHT HOLD OF ONE OF ITS HIND LEGS
8098-275181-0031 I JUST DETERMINED TO HAVE IT OUT WITH HIM CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT A FOX IS A VERY ACTIVE SHARP BITING ANIMAL AND THAT THIS WAS AN UNUSUALLY LARGE MALE I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT TOM GOT OFF VERY WELL
8098-275181-0032 I DO NOT THINK THAT HE EVER CARED TO MAKE A FOX TRAP OF HIMSELF AGAIN HOWEVER WE SOLD THE FOX SKIN IN THE VILLAGE AND RECEIVED THIRTEEN DOLLARS FOR IT WHEREAS A COMMON RED FOX SKIN IS WORTH NO MORE THAN THREE DOLLARS
8098-275181-0033 HOW OR BY WHAT WILES THAT FOX GOT THE TURKEYS OUT OF THE HIGH BUTTERNUT IS A SECRET
8098-278252-0000 MUCH POMP AND SEVERAL CIRCUMSTANCES FROM WILLOUGHBY WE WENT TO CLEVELAND MY ROUTE THROUGH THE BEAUTIFUL CITY LAY ALONG ONE OF THE FINEST RESIDENCE STREETS IN AMERICA THE FAMOUS EUCLID AVENUE
8098-278252-0001 FROM THERE WE MARCHED TO SUPERIOR STREET WHERE CHEERS GREETED US ON EVERY HAND THE PAPERS HAD HERALDED MY ADVENT AND AS IN THE OTHER TOWNS AND CITIES
8098-278252-0002 THE NEWSPAPER ARTISTS HAD TAXED THEIR IMAGINATIONS TO PICTURE POD AND MAC
8098-278252-0003 AND WHEN I RODE OUT ON TO THE STAGE THE HOUSE SHOOK WITH LAUGHTER AND CHEERS I MADE A SHORT ADDRESS AND ANNOUNCED THAT I WOULD SELL PHOTOS OF MAC A'RONY AND HIS MASTER AT THE DOOR
8098-278252-0004 THAT THEATRE PUT ME WAY AHEAD FINANCIALLY THURSDAY MORNING I CALLED ON THE MAYOR MARK HANNA AND SENATOR GARFIELD AND ADDED THE AUTOGRAPHS OF ALL THREE TO MY ALBUM
8098-278252-0005 MISTER GARFIELD INVITED ME TO ATTEND THE WEEKLY DINNER AND RECEPTION OF THE BEER AND SKITTLES CLUB THAT EVENING I WENT AND ENJOYED MYSELF
8098-278252-0006 ONLY MAKING THIRTEEN MILES
8098-278252-0007 A MILE BEYOND TWO MEN REMINDED ME IT WAS A VERY WINTRY DAY THEN A WOMAN DROVE PAST AND TOSSED ME THE COMFORTING REMINDER DON'T YOU FIND IT AWFULLY COLD I DID NOT REPLY TO THE LAST TWO
8098-278252-0008 TWENTY MINUTES LATER A BOY FROM A COZY HOME YELLED TO ME I HAD PASSED TO SOME DISTANCE AND DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT SOUNDED LIKE
8098-278252-0009 I HESITATED A MOMENT IN THE BITING WIND THEN RETRACED MY STEPS AND CALLED TO THE LAD WHAT'S THAT YOU SAID
8098-278252-0010 YELLED THE SCAMP I WAS MAD ENOUGH TO UNLOAD MY WINCHESTER BUT I DIDN'T
8098-278252-0011 RUBBED MY EARS AND CONTINUED MY JOURNEY LIKE AN ICE COVERED VOLCANO A MILE BEYOND A WAGON WITH A FAMILY IN IT PASSED ME AND THE MAN SAID COLD MY FRIEND AT DUSK A FARMER INQUIRED
8098-278252-0012 I SHOUTED SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE THE RIG STOPPED A FUR CLAD HEAD STUCK OUT TO ONE SIDE AND A MALE VOICE CALLED
8098-278252-0013 I AMBLED UP PUT A FOOT ON THE HUB OF A WHEEL AND SAID I SIMPLY WANT TO SAY IT'S A COLD DAY YOU AS SOON AS HE HAD FINISHED I SAID BY WAY OF CIVIL EXPLANATION
8098-278252-0014 MY DEAR SIR DO YOU KNOW A HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE STOPPED ME TO DAY AND TOLD ME IT IS COLD I HAVE TRAMPED NEARLY TWENTY MILES WITHOUT STOPPING TO WARM OR EAT
8098-278252-0015 AND I RESOLVED TO LET THE NEXT FELLOW HAVE THE SAME DOSE I HAVE BEEN TAKING HALF HOURLY ALL DAY NOW IF YOU ARE SATISFIED THAT IT IS A COLD DAY I WILL BID YOU GOOD NIGHT
8098-278252-0016 WITH THIS I RETURNED TO MY COMPANIONS SOMEWHAT WARMER PHYSICALLY BUT COOLER IN SPIRIT THE HOTEL IN CUYAHOGA FALLS RECEIVED US MOST HOSPITABLY
8098-278252-0017 I NEVER SHALL FORGET THE KINDNESSES OF ITS LANDLADY THE VILLAGE DATES BACK TO PIONEER DAYS IT IS BUILT ON THE HUNTING GROUNDS OF THE OLD CUYAHOGA INDIANS MONDAY MARCH FIRST AT TWELVE THIRTY P M

8098-278252-0019 WHERE HE ROYALLY ENTERTAINED ME AND MY ANIMALS THE PAGEANT THAT CELEBRATED THE DEPARTURE OF WILLIAM MC KINLEY TO THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT WAS A FAIR ESTIMATE OF THE REGARD IN WHICH HIS FELLOW CITIZENS HELD HIM
8098-278252-0020 CANTON DID HIM HONOR I WITNESSED THE LEAVE TAKING AT HIS HOUSE HIS RIDE TO THE TRAIN IN THE COACH DRAWN BY FOUR GREYS UNDER ESCORT OF A BAND

8098-278252-0023 CANNON BOOMED STEAM WHISTLES SHRIEKED AND THE CITIZENS SHOUTED AND HURRAHED AND I WAS GLAD MAC WAS NOT WITH ME TO ADD HIS SALUTE
8098-278252-0024 I SAW A MEADOW LARK ON THE FIRST OF MARCH THIS DAY I HEARD BLUE BIRDS AND ROBINS SINGING GAILY IT LOOKED AS THOUGH SPRING HAD COME TO STAY I EXPECTED THAT DAY TO REACH DALTON ONLY EIGHT MILES DISTANT
8098-278252-0025 THAT ONCE I WAS COMPELLED TO CRAWL ALONG THE TOP OF A RAIL FENCE TWO HUNDRED FEET AND MORE AND DRAG MY JACKASS AT DUSK I HAD COVERED ONLY THREE MILES THEN I SOUGHT LODGINGS

8098-278252-0028 I FOUND THE STORE FULL OF LOUNGERS WHO PATRONIZED THE CHAIRS SOAP AND STARCH BOXES MACKEREL KITS AND COUNTER FORMING A SILENT CIRCLE ROUND A TOWERING STOVE IN THE CENTER
8098-278252-0029 THE VILLAGE TREASURER WORE A BOILED SHIRT AND BRASS COLLAR BUTTONS BUT NO COLLAR OR COAT HIS COMPANIONS WERE GENERALLY ATTIRED IN FLANNEL SHIRTS OF DIFFERENT HUES AND PATTERNS

8098-278278-0002 AT THAT TIME IN CRIPPLE CREEK SEVERAL BOYS RANGING FROM A DAY TO SIX WEEKS OLD WHOSE DESTINIES WERE THOUGHT TO BE PROMISING WERE AFFLICTED WITH MY MASTER'S PONDEROUS NAME
8098-278278-0003 A LITTLE GREEN EYED IRISH GIRL FIVE DAYS OLD WAS NAMED PYTHAGORINA PODINA MULGARRY
8098-278278-0004 THE HAPPY FATHER CALLED PERSONALLY ON POD AND ASKED HIM TO ACT AS GODFATHER AT THE BAPTISMAL SERVICE SUNDAY AFTERNOON THE IMPRESSIVE CEREMONY TOOK PLACE AT THE CABIN OF MISS PYTHAGORINA
8098-278278-0005 AS THE AGED GRANDMOTHER WISHED TO WITNESS IT POD SAID HE WAS SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED ABOUT ATTENDING SINCE HE HAD FORGOTTEN ALMOST ALL HIS LATIN
8098-278278-0006 BUT HE ARRANGED WITH ONE OF THE PALL BEARERS TO GIVE HIM NUDGES AND KICKS WHEN IT WAS EXPECTED OF HIM TO MAKE A RESPONSE AND SO HE GOT THROUGH FAIRLY WELL BETTER THAN THE KID DID HE SAID THE BABE WAS AN UNRULY CHILD
8098-278278-0007 AND KICKED SO FRANTICALLY WHEN THE PRIEST TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS THAT TWO FLATIRONS WERE TIED TO ITS FEET TO KEEP THEM DOWN IT WAS SIMPLY NERVOUSNESS BECAUSE THE HIGH ALTITUDE AFFECTED THE CHILD'S NERVES
8098-278278-0008 THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT AND SURPRISE BECAUSE THE FLATIRONS DIDN'T FLOAT AND THE UNDERTAKER OR WHAT YOU CALL EM OVERTURNED THE BARREL OF WATER AND SET EVERYBODY AFLOAT DRENCHING THE SPONSORS AND GUESTS
8098-278278-0009 POD SAID THE SCENE WAS WITHOUT A PARALLEL HE WAS SOAKED TO HIS EQUATOR THE HALF CHRISTENED HALF DROWNED PYTHAGORINA PODINA WAS PICKED UP FROM THE FLOOD WITH A TABLESPOON AND THE CEREMONY FINISHED
8098-278278-0010 THEN SHE WAS ROLLED ON THE BARREL TO GET ALL THE WATER OUT OF HER AND PUT TO BED WITH HOT FLATIRONS AT HER FEET TO PREVENT CROUP AND MUMPS THEN THE WAKE BROKE UP I DON'T BELIEVE THE CHILD UNDERSTOOD A WORD THAT THE PRIEST SAID
8098-278278-0011 POD DIDN'T THAT NIGHT HE GOT UP A FINE SUPPER AND INVITED SOME OLD FRIENDS HE BOUGHT A BIG PORTERHOUSE STEAK THICK AND TENDER AND PERSONALLY BROILED IT ON HIS PATENT FOLDING STOVE
8098-278278-0012 JUST WHEN EVERYTHING WAS ON THE TABLE AND THE GUESTS WERE FINDING STONES AND TIN PLATES TO SIT ON DON NOT HAVING HAD A THING TO EAT FOR AN HOUR COOLLY PULLED THE HOT STEAK OFF THE PLATTER AND DROPPED IT ON THE GROUND
8098-278278-0013 POD DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING THOUGH BUT JUST FORKED IT ON TO THE PLATTER AND SCRAPED OFF SOME DRY GRASS AND A SLIVER AND A BUG AND CARVED IT UP
8098-278278-0014 THE LADIES LOOKED AT THE DOG AND THEN AT POD NOT KNOWING WHICH TO THANK THEN FEELING SENSITIVE ABOUT ACCEPTING THE BEST PART OF THE STEAK INSISTED UPON POD'S HAVING ONE OF THEIR PIECES AND COONSKIN THE OTHER
8098-278278-0015 AFTER SUPPER DON FEASTED ON THE TOUGHER PARTS OF THE STEAK AND WE DONKS WERE FED THE SCRAPS OF POTATOES AND BREAD AND TIN TOMATO AND PEACH CANS WHEN THE BANQUET WAS OVER THE GUESTS WENT HOME
8098-278278-0016 ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK WE WENT INTO CAMP ON THE MARGIN OF A FAMOUS PETRIFIED FOREST POD OBJECTED AT FIRST BECAUSE OF THE SCARCITY OF FIRE WOOD
8098-278278-0017 LOTS OF PETRIFIED WOOD CHIPS LYING AROUND I REMARKED AND THEY'LL LAST ORDINARY WOOD BURNS UP TOO FAST BRIGHT IDEA EXCLAIMED POD AND COONSKIN WENT TO WORK GATHERING PETRIFIED WOOD FOR THE SUPPER FIRE
8098-278278-0018 THE ONLY TROUBLE WILL BE IN STARTING THE FIRE SAID POD JUST AS SOON AS IT'S ONCE GOING IT OUGHT TO BURN SMOOTHLY ENOUGH
8098-278278-0019 COONSKIN'S OPINION DIDN'T BENEFIT POD MUCH HIS HARD WOOD FIRE WASN'T VERY SATISFACTORY BUT WITH SOME DRY BRUSH THE MEN GOT THE MEAL UNDER WAY NEXT MORNING WE VISITED THE NOTED PETRIFIED STUMP
8098-278278-0020 MEASURING UPWARDS OF FORTY FIVE FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE SEVERAL SAWS WERE IMBEDDED IN IT FOR MANY FUTILE ATTEMPTS HAD BEEN MADE TO TAKE OFF SOME SLICES FOR THE DENVER EXPOSITION
8098-278278-0021 IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED BY VARIOUS ORNITHOLOGISTS BOTANISTS AND ENTOMOLOGISTS THAT THE STUMP IS MILLIONS OF YEARS OLD I THINK THEY WERE GUESSING AT IT FOR I COULDN'T SEE THE RINGS
8098-278278-0022 SEVERAL TIMES I HAD A SUSPICION THAT WE HAD BEEN MISDIRECTED WHEN WE CAME TO THE END OF A NARROW WOOD ROAD I WAS SURE OF IT
8098-278278-0023 BEST TO GO THROUGH THE WOODS SAID THE VALET SO WE WERE HEADED FOR THE TIMBER OUR TRAMP THROUGH THE FOREST I CANNOT SOON FORGET UP AND DOWN THE ROCKY HEIGHTS THROUGH THICKETS OF QUAKING ASP AND PINE
8098-278278-0024 AND REALIZED WE WERE LOST COONSKIN SAID HE WAS AN EXPERIENCED WOODMAN AND WOULD BLAZE THE TREES SO WE WOULD GET OUT AGAIN WONDERFUL THE AMOUNT OF LEARNING HE HAD GLEANED FROM DIME NOVELS
8098-278278-0025 HE LAGGED BEHIND TO DO THE BLAZING AND PRETTY SOON I SMELT SMOKE THE PROFESSOR SNUFFED SMELLS AS IF THE WOODS WERE ON FIRE SOMEWHERE HINTED POD LOOK BEHIND YOU THEY ARE I EXCLAIMED
8098-278278-0026 AND POD CAUGHT THAT ERUDITE VALET BACK WOODSMAN IN THE ACT OF SETTING A TREE ON FIRE WITH OIL AND MATCHES FORTUNATELY FOR US THE WIND WASN'T BLOWING STRONG
8098-278278-0027 BUT WE HAD TO CHANGE OUR COURSE SOME AND HUSTLE FASTER FOR THE BLAZING TRAIL CHASED US COONSKIN LEARNED A NEW LESSON AND TURNED DOWN THE CORNER OF THE PAGE SO HE'D RECOLLECT IT
8098-278278-0028 A BOARD SIGN INFORMED US IT WAS SIMPLY TURKEY CREEK I COULDN'T SEE ANY TURKEYS BUT THERE WAS GOOD PASTURAGE AROUND THE HOT TRIP THROUGH THE TIMBER MADE US ALL HUNGRY
8098-278278-0029 IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK WHEN WE DONKS WERE PICKETED AND ALLOWED TO GRAZE THEN COONSKIN WENT FISHING HE SAID HE HAD SEEN SOME TROUT IN THE STREAM BY SUPPER TIME HE HAD CAUGHT A NICE MESS
8098-278278-0030 POD SAID HE WOULD FRY THE FISH AND WENT AT IT SO ENTHUSIASTICALLY THAT HE FORGOT TO PUT THE BAG OF CORN MEAL BACK IN ITS PLACE AFTER THE MEAL WAS OVER HE BEGAN TO LOOK AROUND FOR THE BAG IT WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
8098-278278-0031 I HAD EATEN THE CORN MEAL AND BAG IT WAS COMICAL HOW THOSE TWO MEN PUZZLED THEIR BRAINS ABOUT THAT MISSING COMMODITY WHEN COONSKIN DETECTED SOME MEAL STAMPED IN THE GROUND POD POINTED AT ME AND SAID
8098-278278-0032 THAT'S THE THIEF THERE NEXT MORNING COONSKIN WAS THE FIRST TO RETURN FROM FISHING AND LOOKED MUCH EXCITED WHEN POD RETURNED HE TOLD HIM HE HAD SEEN HUGE BEAR TRACKS HE WAS GOING BEAR HUNTING POD LAUGHED AT HIM
8098-278278-0033 THAT WAS MY EXPERIENCE IN THE WOODS OF WISCONSIN THE MEN AT THE SAW MILL SAID WE SHOULD SEE BEAR IN THIS FOREST
8098-278278-0034 ITS SKIN WOULD FETCH FIFTY DOLLARS OR MORE LET'S LOOK FOR BEAR WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU SAW A BEAR POD ASKED WELL NOW LEAVE THAT TO ME SAID COONSKIN
8098-278278-0035 IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WOULD BE WORTH A HAIRBREADTH ESCAPE TO SEE ONE WILD I'VE ONLY SEEN BEARS IN CIRCUSES OR TRAVELING CHAINED TO ITALIANS IN THE SECOND PLACE I CAN RUN I'VE PLENTY OF MEDALS FOR SPRINTING
8098-278278-0036 POD WENT FISHING THAT AFTERNOON WITH A GUN AND TOOK THE WHOLE ARSENAL ALONG WITH HIM INCLUDING THE AXE SOMEWHERE ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK POD CAME INTO CAMP WITH A GOOD MESS OF TROUT AFTER CLEANING THE FISH HE TOOK OFF HIS GUNS
8098-278278-0037 AND LAID DOWN ON THE GRASS AND WONDERED IF THAT CRAZY VALET HAD RUN ACROSS ANY MORE BEAR TRACKS HE WASN'T THERE LONG WHEN SUDDENLY I HEARD YELLS ISSUING FROM THE CANYON DOWN STREAM ROUND THE BEND
8098-278278-0038 THE SHOUTING SOUNDED NEARER EVERY SECOND AND I SOON DISTINGUISHED COONSKIN'S VOICE POD GOT UP FROM THE GROUND EXCITEDLY COONSKIN'S IN TROUBLE PLAIN ENOUGH SAID POD ALOUD TO HIMSELF I MUST RUN TO HIS AID
8098-278278-0039 SO HE STARTED ON A TROT DOWN STREAM TO THE BEND AND THEN QUICKLY TURNED FALLING ALL OVER HIMSELF AND RAN TOWARD THE CABINS FASTER THAN I EVER SAW HIM RUN BEFORE OR SINCE
8098-278278-0040 AND IMMEDIATELY COONSKIN CAME FLYING INTO VIEW WITH THE BIGGEST BEAR AT HIS HEELS I EVER WANT TO SEE
8123-275193-0000 JEFF THE INQUISITIVE BY GENERAL RUSH C HAWKINS AMONG THE GUNBOATS DOING DUTY ON THE INLAND WATERS OF NORTH CAROLINA IN THE EARLY SPRING OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO
8123-275193-0001 WHICH COMPOSED WHAT COMMODORE GOLDSBOROUGH DESIGNATED HIS PASTEBOARD FLEET WAS THE LOUISIANA COMMANDED BY COMMANDER ALEXANDER MURRAY WHO WAS NOTED FOR HIS EFFICIENCY AND GOOD NATURE HIS TREATMENT OF HIS CREW
8123-275193-0002 MADE HIM ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR OFFICERS IN THE WHOLE FLEET HE ENTERED INTO ALL OF THEIR SPORTS AND SYMPATHIZED WITH THE DISCOMFORTS OF FORECASTLE LIFE HE WAS FOND OF ANIMAL PETS AND ALWAYS WELCOMED THE ARRIVAL OF A NEW ONE
8123-275193-0003 HE WAS A PERFECTLY BLACK PIG OF THE RACER RAZOR BACK ORDER WHICH AT THAT TIME WERE PLENTIFUL IN THE COAST SECTIONS OF THE MORE SOUTHERN OF THE SLAVE HOLDING STATES THEY WERE CALLED RACERS
8123-275193-0004 BECAUSE OF THEIR LONG LEGS SLENDER BODIES AND GREAT CAPACITY FOR RUNNING AND RAZOR BACKS ON ACCOUNT OF THE PROMINENCE OF THE SPINAL COLUMN THE ORIGIN OF THIS PARTICULAR SPECIES OF THE PORCINE TRIBE IS UNKNOWN BUT THERE IS A TRADITION TO THE EFFECT
8123-275193-0005 POSSIBLY WHILE ESCAPING FROM THE PROSPECTIVE MESS KETTLE OF A CONFEDERATE PICKET IN THOSE DAYS CONFEDERATE PICKETS WERE NOT VERY PARTICULAR AS TO THE QUALITY OR KIND OF FOOD AND I HAVE A SUSPICION THAT EVEN A RAZOR BACK WOULD HAVE BEEN A WELCOME ADDITION TO THEIR MEAL
8123-275193-0006 THE DOCTOR WAS CONSULTED AND AFTER A CAREFUL DIAGNOSIS DECIDED THERE WAS NO ORGANIC DISEASE WANT OF PARENTAL CARE WANT OF NOURISHMENT AND EXPOSURE WERE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR JEFF'S UNFAVORABLE CONDITION
8123-275193-0007 IT WAS DECIDED TO PUT HIM ON A LIGHT DIET OF MILK WHICH PROVED AN IMMEDIATE SUCCESS FOR WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS AFTER HIS FIRST MEAL THE PATIENT BECAME AS LIVELY AS POSSIBLE AS DAYS AND WEEKS WENT ON
8123-275193-0008 HE ATTACHED HIMSELF TO EACH INDIVIDUAL OF THE SHIP HE HAD NO FAVORITES BUT WAS HAIL FELLOW WELL MET WITH ALL HE DEVELOPED ALL THE PLAYFUL QUALITIES OF A PUPPY AND REASONED OUT A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS IN HIS OWN WAY
8123-275193-0009 HIS PARTICULAR ADMIRERS DECLARED THAT HE LEARNED THE MEANING OF THE DIFFERENT WHISTLES OF THE BOATSWAIN THAT HE KNEW WHEN THE MEAL PENNANT WAS HOISTED TO THE PEAK COULD TELL WHEN THE CREW WAS BEAT TO QUARTERS FOR DRILL
8123-275193-0010 IN THIS ACT OF COURTESY HE IS ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED BY THE OFFICER OF THE DECK AND OFTEN BY OTHERS THAT MAY HAPPEN TO BE AT HAND AFTER THE ADVENT OF JEFF WHENEVER I WENT ON BOARD THE LOUISIANA HE WAS ALWAYS AT THE GANGWAY
8123-275193-0011 AND SEEMINGLY WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE EVENT IT MAY BE SAID OF HIM GENERALLY THAT HE WAS OVERFLOWING WITH SPIRITS AND TOOK AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN ALL THE DAILY ROUTINE WORK OF HIS SHIP
8123-275193-0012 IN THE GRADUAL DEVELOPMENT OF JEFF'S CHARACTER IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT HE HAD NONE OF THE USUAL WELL KNOWN TRAITS OF THE PIG HE WAS MORE LIKE A PETTED AND PAMPERED DOG
8123-275193-0013 WAS PLAYFUL GOOD NATURED AND EXPRESSED PLEASURE PAIN ANGER AND DESIRE WITH VARIOUS SQUEALS AND GRUNTS DELIVERED WITH A VARIETY OF INTONATIONS THAT WERE VERY EASILY INTERPRETED
8123-275193-0014 HE WAS NEVER SO HAPPY AS WHEN IN THE LAP OF ONE OF THE SAILORS HAVING HIS BACK STROKED HIS PLEASURE UPON THOSE OCCASIONS WAS EVINCED BY THE EMISSION OF FREQUENT GOOD NATURED GRUNTS AND LOOKING UP INTO THE FACE OF THE FRIENDLY STROKER
8123-275193-0015 WHEN ON SHORE HE FOLLOWED HIS FAVORITES LIKE A DOG AND WAS NEVER KNOWN TO ROOT EXCEPT IN SPEECH AND APPEARANCE HE WAS THE COUNTERPART OF A HAPPY GOOD NATURED AND WELL CARED FOR HOUSEHOLD DOG
8123-275193-0016 POSSIBLY HOWEVER RATHER MORE INTELLIGENT THAN THE AVERAGE CANINE PET THE FOURTH OF JULY EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO WAS A GALA DAY AT ROANOKE ISLAND
8123-275193-0017 WAS MADE MORE GLORIOUS BY THE EXCHANGE OF CAMP HOSPITALITIES AND AN INDULGENCE IN SUCH SIMPLE HILARITY AS THE OCCASION SEEMED TO REQUIRE BUT JEFF WAS NOT FORGOTTEN EARLY IN THE MORNING HE WAS BATHED AND SCRUBBED
8123-275193-0018 MORE THAN TO HIS HEART'S CONTENT AND THEN PATRIOTICALLY DECORATED IN HIS RIGHT EAR WAS A RED RIBBON IN HIS LEFT A WHITE ONE AROUND HIS NECK ANOTHER OF BLUE
8123-275193-0019 THUS ADORNED HE WAS BROUGHT ON SHORE TO PAY ME A VISIT AND AS HE CAME THROUGH MY DOOR HE APPEARED TO BE FILLED WITH THE PRIDE OF PATRIOTISM AND A REALIZATION OF THE GREATNESS OF THE OCCASION
8123-275193-0020 HIS REWARD FOR THIS UNUSUAL DEMONSTRATION WAS INSTANTANEOUS AND CONSISTED OF SOME APPLES AND A TOOTHSOME DESSERT OF SUGAR AFTERWARD HE MADE THE ROUND OF THE CAMPS WITH A SPECIAL ESCORT OF WARRANT OFFICERS AND DEVOTED JACK TARS
8123-275193-0021 HE WAS SEEN AFTER HE HAD RUN A FEW YARDS TO MAKE A GREAT JUMP AND THEN REMAIN IN HIS TRACKS THE PURSUING PARTY FOUND HIM ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN DEMOLISHING A MOCCASIN WHICH HE HAD CRUSHED BY JUMPING AND LANDING WITH HIS FEET UPON ITS HEAD AND BACK
8123-275193-0022 HOGS OF THIS PARTICULAR KIND ARE FAMOUS SNAKE KILLERS A BIG RATTLER OR A GARTER SNAKE IS ALL THE SAME TO THEM THEY ADVANCE TO THE ATTACK WITH THE GREATEST IMPETUOSITY AND A FEAST UPON SNAKE IS THE USUAL REWARD OF EXCEPTIONAL BRAVERY
8123-275193-0023 JEFF WAS A CONFIRMED LOVER OF GOOD EATING AND IN TIME PAID THE USUAL PENALTY FOR OVER INDULGENCE OF HIS VERY PIGGISH APPETITE WHILE THE MEAL PENNANT WAS UP
8123-275193-0024 IT WAS HIS HABIT TO GO FROM ONE FORE CASTLE MESS TO ANOTHER AND TO INSIST UPON HAVING RATHER MORE THAN HIS SHARE OF THE CHOICE MORSELS FROM EACH IN A SHORT TIME HE CAME TO THE REPAIR SHOP VERY MUCH THE WORSE FOR WEAR WITH AN IMPAIRED DIGESTION
8123-275193-0025 AND A CUTICLE THAT SHOWED UNMISTAKABLE EVIDENCE OF SCURVY FOR THE FIRST HE WAS PUT UPON SHORT RATIONS FOR THE SECOND SAND BATHS ON SHORE WERE PRESCRIBED
8123-275193-0026 UNDER THIS TREATMENT POOR JEFF LOST ALL HIS BUOYANCY OF SPIRITS AND HIS HABITUAL FRISKINESS AND BECAME SAD AND DEJECTED BUT BORE HIS TROUBLES WITH PATIENCE HE TOOK TO THE SAND BATHS AT ONCE
8123-275193-0027 AND GAVE FORTH MANY DISGRUNTLED GRUNTS WHEN LIFTED OUT OF THEM THE LAST TIME I SAW JEFF IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO HE WAS BURIED UP TO HIS EARS IN THE COOL SANDS OF THE ROANOKE ISLAND SHORE WITH EYES UPTURNED AND LOOKING LIKE A VERY SAD PIG
8123-275209-0000 THE BUTTERFLY'S CHILDREN BY MISSUS ALFRED GATTY LET ME HIRE YOU AS A NURSE FOR MY POOR CHILDREN SAID A BUTTERFLY TO A QUIET CATERPILLAR WHO WAS STROLLING ALONG A CABBAGE LEAF IN HER
8123-275209-0001 WHO WILL TAKE CARE OF MY BABY BUTTERFLIES WHEN I AM GONE WILL YOU KIND MILD GREEN CATERPILLAR BUT YOU MUST MIND WHAT YOU GIVE THEM TO EAT CATERPILLAR THEY CANNOT OF COURSE LIVE ON YOUR ROUGH FOOD
8123-275209-0002 YOU MUST GIVE THEM EARLY DEW AND HONEY FROM THE FLOWERS AND YOU MUST LET THEM FLY ABOUT ONLY A LITTLE WAY AT FIRST FOR OF COURSE ONE CAN'T EXPECT THEM TO USE THEIR WINGS PROPERLY ALL AT ONCE
8123-275209-0003 DEAR ME IT IS A SAD PITY YOU CANNOT FLY YOURSELF BUT I HAVE NO TIME TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER NURSE NOW SO YOU WILL DO YOUR BEST I HOPE DEAR DEAR
8123-275209-0004 AND WITH THESE WORDS THE BUTTERFLY DROOPED HER WINGS AND DIED AND THE GREEN CATERPILLAR WHO HAD NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF EVEN SAYING YES OR NO TO THE REQUEST
8123-275209-0005 WAS LEFT STANDING ALONE BY THE SIDE OF THE BUTTERFLY'S EGGS A PRETTY NURSE SHE HAS CHOSEN INDEED POOR LADY EXCLAIMED SHE AND A PRETTY BUSINESS I HAVE IN HAND WHY HER SENSES MUST HAVE LEFT HER
8123-275209-0006 OR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE ASKED A POOR CRAWLING CREATURE LIKE ME TO BRING UP HER DAINTY LITTLE ONES MUCH THEY'LL MIND ME TRULY WHEN THEY FEEL THE GAY WINGS ON THEIR BACKS AND CAN FLY AWAY OUT OF MY SIGHT WHENEVER THEY CHOOSE
8123-275209-0007 HOWEVER THERE LAY THE EGGS ON THE CABBAGE LEAF AND THE GREEN CATERPILLAR HAD A KIND HEART SO SHE RESOLVED TO DO HER BEST BUT SHE GOT NO SLEEP THAT NIGHT SHE WAS SO VERY ANXIOUS
8123-275209-0008 SHE MADE HER BACK QUITE ACHE WITH WALKING ALL NIGHT ROUND HER YOUNG CHARGES FOR FEAR ANY HARM SHOULD HAPPEN TO THEM AND IN THE MORNING SAYS SHE TO HERSELF TWO HEADS ARE BETTER THAN ONE
8123-275209-0009 WHOM SHOULD THE CATERPILLAR CONSULT THERE WAS THE SHAGGY DOG WHO SOMETIMES CAME INTO THE GARDEN BUT HE WAS SO ROUGH HE WOULD MOST LIKELY WHISK ALL THE EGGS OFF THE CABBAGE LEAF WITH ONE BRUSH OF HIS TAIL
8123-275209-0010 SIGHED THE CATERPILLAR IN GREAT DISTRESS AND THEN SHE THOUGHT AND THOUGHT TILL AT LAST SHE THOUGHT OF THE LARK AND SHE FANCIED THAT BECAUSE HE WENT UP SO HIGH AND NOBODY KNEW WHERE HE WENT TO
8123-275209-0011 HE MUST BE VERY CLEVER AND KNOW A GREAT DEAL FOR TO GO UP VERY HIGH WHICH SHE COULD NEVER DO WAS THE CATERPILLAR'S IDEA OF PERFECT GLORY NOW IN THE NEIGHBOURING CORN FIELD THEIR LIVED A LARK
8123-275209-0012 AND THE CATERPILLAR SENT A MESSAGE TO HIM TO BEG HIM TO COME AND TALK TO HER AND WHEN HE CAME SHE TOLD HIM ALL HER DIFFICULTIES AND ASKED HIM WHAT SHE WAS TO DO TO FEED AND REAR THE LITTLE CREATURES SO DIFFERENT FROM HERSELF
8123-275209-0013 PERHAPS YOU WILL BE ABLE TO INQUIRE AND HEAR SOMETHING ABOUT IT NEXT TIME YOU GO UP HIGH OBSERVED THE CATERPILLAR TIMIDLY THE LARK SAID PERHAPS HE SHOULD BUT HE DID NOT SATISFY HER CURIOSITY ANY FURTHER
8123-275209-0014 SOON AFTERWARDS HOWEVER HE WENT SINGING UPWARDS INTO THE BRIGHT BLUE SKY BY DEGREES HIS VOICE DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE TILL THE GREEN CATERPILLAR COULD NOT HEAR A SOUND
8123-275209-0015 SO SHE RESUMED HER WALK ROUND THE BUTTERFLY'S EGGS NIBBLING A BIT OF THE CABBAGE LEAF NOW AND THEN AS SHE MOVED ALONG
8123-275209-0016 I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I AM TOLD OBSERVED THE CATERPILLAR HASTILY WELL THEN FIRST OF ALL I WILL TELL YOU WHAT THESE LITTLE CREATURES ARE TO EAT WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS TO BE GUESS
8123-275209-0017 DEW AND THE HONEY OUT OF FLOWERS I AM AFRAID SIGHED THE CATERPILLAR NO SUCH THING OLD LADY SOMETHING SIMPLER THAN THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN GET AT QUITE EASILY
8123-275209-0018 NEVER SAID THE CATERPILLAR INDIGNANTLY IT WAS THEIR DYING MOTHER'S LAST REQUEST THAT I SHOULD DO NO SUCH THING THEIR DYING MOTHER KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE MATTER PERSISTED THE LARK
8123-275209-0019 BUT WHY DO YOU ASK ME AND THEN DISBELIEVE WHAT I SAY YOU HAVE NEITHER FAITH NOR TRUST OH I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I AM TOLD SAID THE CATERPILLAR NAY BUT YOU DO NOT REPLIED THE LARK YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME EVEN ABOUT THE FOOD
8123-275209-0020 AND YET THAT IS BUT A BEGINNING OF WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHY CATERPILLAR WHAT DO YOU THINK THOSE LITTLE EGGS WILL TURN OUT TO BE BUTTERFLIES TO BE SURE SAID THE CATERPILLAR CATERPILLARS SANG THE LARK
8123-275209-0021 BUT I FIND THAT HE IS FOOLISH AND SAUCY INSTEAD
8123-275209-0022 I WOULD TELL YOU IF YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME SANG THE LARK DESCENDING ONCE MORE I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I AM TOLD REITERATED THE CATERPILLAR WITH AS GRAVE A FACE AS IF IT WERE A FACT
8123-275209-0023 THEN I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE CRIED THE LARK FOR THE BEST OF MY NEWS REMAINS BEHIND YOU WILL ONE DAY BE A BUTTERFLY YOURSELF WRETCHED BIRD EXCLAIMED THE CATERPILLAR
8123-275209-0024 YOU JEST WITH MY INFERIORITY NOW YOU ARE CRUEL AS WELL AS FOOLISH
8123-275209-0025 I WILL ASK YOUR ADVICE NO MORE I TOLD YOU YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE ME CRIED THE LARK NETTLED IN HIS TURN I BELIEVE EVERYTHING THAT I AM TOLD PERSISTED THE CATERPILLAR THAT IS
8123-275209-0026 I SEE SO MANY WONDERFUL THINGS I KNOW NO REASON WHY THERE SHOULD NOT BE MORE OH CATERPILLAR IT IS BECAUSE YOU CRAWL BECAUSE YOU NEVER GET BEYOND YOUR CABBAGE LEAF THAT YOU CALL ANY THING IMPOSSIBLE
8123-275209-0027 AS WELL AS YOU DO LOOK AT MY LONG GREEN BODY AND THESE ENDLESS LEGS AND THEN TALK TO ME ABOUT HAVING WINGS AND A PAINTED FEATHERY COAT FOOL AND FOOL YOU CRIED THE INDIGNANT LARK
8123-275209-0028 OH CATERPILLAR WHAT COMES TO YOU FROM THENCE RECEIVE AS I DO
8123-275209-0029 INTERRUPTED THE LARK HOW AM I TO LEARN FAITH ASKED THE CATERPILLAR AT THAT MOMENT SHE FELT SOMETHING AT HER SIDE SHE LOOKED ROUND EIGHT OR TEN LITTLE GREEN CATERPILLARS WERE MOVING ABOUT
8123-275209-0030 AND HAD ALREADY MADE A SHOW OF A HOLE IN THE CABBAGE LEAF THEY HAD BROKEN FROM THE BUTTERFLY'S EGGS SHAME AND AMAZEMENT FILLED OUR GREEN FRIEND'S HEART BUT JOY SOON FOLLOWED
8123-275209-0031 FOR AS THE FIRST WONDER WAS POSSIBLE THE SECOND MIGHT BE SO TOO TEACH ME YOUR LESSON LARK SHE WOULD SAY AND THE LARK SANG TO HER OF THE WONDERS OF THE EARTH BELOW AND OF THE HEAVEN ABOVE
8123-275209-0032 AND THE CATERPILLAR TALKED ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE TO HER RELATIONS OF THE TIME WHEN SHE SHOULD BE A BUTTERFLY BUT NONE OF THEM BELIEVED HER SHE NEVERTHELESS HAD LEARNT THE LARK'S LESSON OF FAITH
8123-275209-0033 AND WHEN SHE WAS GOING INTO HER CHRYSALIS GRAVE SHE SAID I SHALL BE A BUTTERFLY SOME DAY BUT HER RELATIONS THOUGHT HER HEAD WAS WANDERING AND THEY SAID POOR THING
8123-275209-0034 AND WHEN SHE WAS A BUTTERFLY AND WAS GOING TO DIE AGAIN SHE SAID
8123-275216-0000 TREES BUT TREES THERE WERE IN PLENTY THEY STOOD EVERYWHERE FROM COAST TO COAST THEY SAW THEMSELVES REFLECTED IN ALL THE RIVERS AND LAKES AND STRETCHED THEIR MIGHTY BOUGHS UP TOWARDS HEAVEN
8123-275216-0001 WE ARE ALL OAK TREES THEY SAID WE OWN THE LAND AND RULE OVER IT AND THEY WERE RIGHT THERE WERE ONLY A FEW HUMAN BEINGS THERE IN THOSE DAYS AND THOSE THAT THERE WERE WERE NOTHING BETTER THAN WILD ANIMALS
8123-275216-0002 THE BEAR THE WOLF AND THE FOX WENT OUT HUNTING WHILE THE STAG GRAZED BY THE EDGE OF THE FEN THE FIELD MOUSE SAT OUTSIDE HIS HOLE AND ATE ACORNS AND THE BEAVER BUILT HIS ARTISTIC HOUSES BY THE RIVER BANKS
8123-275216-0003 ONE DAY THE BEAR CAME TRUDGING ALONG AND LAY DOWN AT FULL BREADTH UNDER A GREAT OAK TREE ARE YOU THERE AGAIN YOU ROBBER SAID THE OAK AND SHOOK A LOT OF WITHERED LEAVES DOWN OVER HIM YOU SHOULD NOT SQUANDER YOUR LEAVES MY OLD FRIEND
8123-275216-0004 SAID THE BEAR LICKING HIS PAWS THAT IS ALL THE SHADE YOU CAN GIVE AGAINST THE SUN IF YOU ARE NOT PLEASED WITH ME YOU CAN GO ANSWERED THE OAK PROUDLY
8123-275216-0005 I AM LORD IN THE LAND AND WHATEVER WAY YOU LOOK YOU FIND MY BROTHERS AND NOTHING ELSE TRUE MUTTERED THE BEAR THAT IS JUST WHAT IS SO SICKENING I HAVE BEEN FOR A LITTLE TOUR ABROAD I MAY TELL YOU AND AM JUST A LITTLE BIT SPOILT
8123-275216-0006 IT WAS IN A LAND DOWN TOWARDS THE SOUTH THERE I TOOK A NAP UNDER THE BEECH TREES THEY ARE TALL SLIM TREES NOT CROOKED OLD THINGS LIKE YOU AND THEIR TOPS ARE SO DENSE THAT THE SUNBEAMS CANNOT CREEP THROUGH THEM
8123-275216-0007 BUT I DON'T WANT TO CHATTER ANY MORE WITH YOU JUST NOW I HAVE HAD TO TROT A MILE ON ACCOUNT OF A CONFOUNDED HUNTER WHO STRUCK ME ON ONE OF MY HIND LEGS WITH AN ARROW NOW I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE A SLEEP
8123-275216-0008 AND PERHAPS YOU WILL BE KIND ENOUGH TO LEAVE ME AT PEACE SINCE YOU CANNOT GIVE ME SHADE THE BEAR STRETCHED HIMSELF OUT AND CLOSED HIS EYES BUT HE GOT NO SLEEP THAT TIME FOR THE OTHER TREES HAD HEARD HIS STORY
8123-275216-0009 WHAT KIND OF TREES CAN THEY BE WHOSE LEAVES SIT SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT THE SUNBEAMS CANNOT CREEP BETWEEN THEM ASKED A LITTLE OAK WHO WAS LISTENING TO WHAT THE BIG ONES WERE TALKING ABOUT BUT BY HIS SIDE STOOD AN OLD GNARLED TREE
8123-275216-0010 WHO GAVE THE LITTLE OAK A CLOUT ON THE HEAD WITH ONE OF HIS LOWEST BOUGHS HOLD YOUR TONGUE HE SAID AND DON'T TALK TILL YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT YOU NEED NONE OF YOU BELIEVE A WORD OF THE BEAR'S NONSENSE
8123-275216-0011 I WILL BRING SOME BEECH NUTS WITH ME AND I VOW YOU WILL ALL TURN YELLOW WITH JEALOUSY WHEN YOU SEE HOW PRETTY THE NEW TREES ARE THEN HE MADE OFF BUT THE OAKS TALKED THE WHOLE DAY LONG ONE TO ANOTHER ABOUT THE FUNNY TREES HE HAD TOLD THEM ABOUT
8123-275216-0012 IF THEY COME I WILL KILL THEM SAID THE LITTLE OAK TREE BUT DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS HE GOT ONE ON THE HEAD FROM THE OLD OAK IF THEY COME YOU SHALL TREAT THEM POLITELY YOU YOUNG DOG SAID HE BUT THEY WILL NOT COME
8123-275216-0013 BUT IN THIS THE OLD OAK WAS WRONG FOR THEY DID COME TOWARDS AUTUMN THE BEAR CAME BACK AND LAY DOWN UNDER THE OLD OAK MY FRIENDS DOWN THERE WISH ME TO PRESENT THEIR COMPLIMENTS HE SAID
8123-275216-0014 AND HE PICKED SOME FUNNY THINGS OUT OF HIS SHAGGY COAT HERE YOU MAY SEE WHAT I HAVE FOR YOU WHAT IS IT ASKED THE OAK THAT IS BEECH ANSWERED THE BEAR THE BEECH NUTS WHICH I PROMISED YOU
8123-275216-0015 THEY KILLED MY WIFE AND ONE OF MY BROTHERS AND I MUST SEE ABOUT FINDING A PLACE WHERE I CAN LIVE IN PEACE THERE IS SCARCELY A SPOT LEFT WHERE A SELF RESPECTING BEAR CAN STAY GOODBYE YOU OLD GNARLED OAK TREES
8123-275216-0016 THE SNOW LAY HIGH OVER THE WHOLE LAND AND EVERY TREE STOOD DEEP IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS AND DREAMT OF THE SPRING AND WHEN THE SPRING CAME THE GRASS STOOD GREEN AND THE BIRDS BEGAN SINGING WHERE THEY LEFT OFF LAST
8123-275216-0017 THE KINGS OF THE WOOD DO NOT COME TILL THE WHOLE COMPANY IS ASSEMBLED BUT AT LAST THEY CAME ALL THE LEAVES BURST FORTH FROM THE SWOLLEN BUDS AND THE TREES LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND COMPLIMENTED ONE ANOTHER ON THEIR BEAUTY
8123-275216-0018 AND EVERY MORNING WHEN THE SUN CAME OUT THEY PEEPED DOWN TO LOOK FOR THE BEECHES THEY WERE REALLY A LITTLE UNEASY BUT THEY WERE TOO PROUD TO TALK ABOUT IT AND ONE DAY THE LITTLE SHOOTS DID AT LAST BURST FORTH FROM THE EARTH

8123-275216-0025 THE BEECHES ONLY LAUGHED AND WENT ON GROWING AT LAST THEY CLOSED TOGETHER OVER THE LITTLE OAK'S HEAD AND THEN HE DIED THAT WAS A HORRID THING TO DO
8123-275216-0026 A GREAT OAK CALLED OUT AND SHOOK HIS BOUGHS IN TERROR BUT THE OLD OAK TOOK HIS FOSTER CHILDREN UNDER HIS PROTECTION IT SERVES HIM RIGHT HE SAID HE IS PAID OUT FOR HIS BOASTING
8123-275216-0027 YOU BEGIN TO BE RATHER PUSHING THE OLD TREE SAID YOU SHOULD TRY TO GROW A LITTLE BROADER AND STOP THIS SHOOTING UP INTO THE AIR JUST SEE WHERE YOUR BRANCHES ARE SOARING

8123-275216-0029 EVERY ONE HAS HIS OWN MANNER OF GROWTH AND WE HAVE OURS ANSWERED THE YOUNG BEECHES THIS IS THE WAY IT'S DONE WHERE WE COME FROM AND WE ARE PERHAPS AS GOOD AS YOU ARE
8123-275216-0030 THAT IS NOT A POLITE WAY OF SPEAKING TO AN OLD TREE WITH MOSS ON HIS BOUGHS SAID THE OAK I BEGIN TO REPENT THAT I WAS SO KIND TO YOU IF YOU HAVE A SPARK OF HONOURABLE FEELING ALIVE IN YOU
8123-275216-0031 BE GOOD ENOUGH TO MOVE YOUR LEAVES A LITTLE TO ONE SIDE THERE HAVE BEEN SCARCELY ANY BUDS ON MY LOWEST BRANCHES THIS YEAR YOU OVERSHADOW ME SO I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND HOW THAT CONCERNS US ANSWERED THE BEECHES
8123-275216-0032 EVERY ONE HAS QUITE ENOUGH TO DO TO LOOK AFTER HIMSELF IF HE IS EQUAL TO HIS WORK AND HAS LUCK IT TURNS OUT WELL FOR HIM IF NOT HE MUST BE PREPARED TO GO TO THE WALL THAT IS THE WAY OF THE WORLD
8123-275216-0033 THEN THE OAK'S LOWEST BRANCH DIED AND HE BEGAN TO BE SERIOUSLY ALARMED YOU ARE PRETTY THINGS HE SAID IF THIS IS THE WAY YOU REWARD ME FOR MY HOSPITALITY WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE I LET YOU GROW AT MY FEET
8123-275216-0034 AND SHELTERED YOU AGAINST THE STORM I LET THE SUN SHINE ON YOU AS MUCH AS EVER HE WOULD AND I TREATED YOU AS IF YOU WERE MY OWN CHILDREN AND IN RETURN FOR ALL THIS YOU STIFLE ME STUFF AND NONSENSE
8123-275216-0035 SAID THE BEECHES SO THEY PUT FORTH FLOWERS AND FRUIT AND WHEN THE FRUIT WAS RIPE THE WIND SHOOK THE BOUGHS AND SCATTERED IT ROUND FAR AND WIDE YOU ARE QUICK PEOPLE LIKE ME SAID THE WIND I LIKE YOU FOR IT
8123-275216-0036 AND AM GLAD TO DO YOU A GOOD TURN AND THE FOX ROLLED ON THE GROUND AT THE FOOT OF THE BEECH TREES AND GOT HIS FUR FULL OF THE PRICKLY FRUITS AND RAN WITH THEM FAR OUT INTO THE COUNTRY THE BEAR DID THE SAME
8123-275216-0037 AND GRINNED INTO THE BARGAIN AT THE OLD OAK WHILE HE LAY AND RESTED IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES THE FIELD MOUSE WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH JOY OVER HIS NEW FOOD AND THOUGHT THAT BEECH NUTS TASTED MUCH NICER THAN ACORNS
8123-275216-0038 ALL ROUND NEW LITTLE BEECH TREES SHOT UP WHICH GREW JUST AS FAST AS THEIR PARENTS AND LOOKED AS GREEN AND AS HAPPY AS IF THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT AN UNEASY CONSCIENCE WAS
8123-275216-0039 BUT THE OLD OAK GAZED SADLY OUT OVER THE WOOD THE LIGHT GREEN BEECH LEAVES WERE PEEPING OUT EVERYWHERE AND THE OAKS WERE SIGHING AND BEWAILING THEIR DISTRESS TO ONE ANOTHER
8123-275216-0040 THEY ARE TAKING OUR STRENGTH OUT OF US THEY SAID AND SHOOK AS MUCH AS THE BEECHES AROUND WOULD LET THEM THE LAND IS OURS NO LONGER ONE BOUGH DIED AFTER ANOTHER
8123-275216-0041 AND THE STORM BROKE THEM OFF AND CAST THEM ON THE GROUND THE OLD OAK HAD NOW ONLY A FEW LEAVES LEFT AT THE VERY TOP THE END IS NEAR HE SAID GRAVELY
8123-275216-0042 BY THIS TIME THERE WERE MANY MORE HUMAN BEINGS IN THE LAND THAN THERE WERE BEFORE AND THEY MADE HASTE TO HEW DOWN THE OAKS WHILE THERE WERE STILL SOME REMAINING OAK TIMBER IS BETTER THAN BEECH TIMBER THEY SAID
8123-275216-0043 AT LAST WE GET A LITTLE APPRECIATION SAID THE OLD OAK BUT WE HAVE TO PAY FOR IT WITH OUR LIVES THEN HE SAID TO THE BEECH TREES WHAT WAS I THINKING OF WHEN I HELPED YOU ON IN YOUR YOUNG DAYS
8123-275216-0044 WHAT AN OLD STUPID I WAS BEFORE THAT WE OAK TREES WERE LORDS IN THE LAND AND NOW EVERY YEAR I SEE MY BROTHERS AROUND ME PERISHING IN THE FIGHT AGAINST YOU IT WILL SOON BE ALL OVER WITH ME
8123-275216-0045 AND NOT ONE OF MY ACORNS HAS SPROUTED UNDER YOUR SHADE BUT BEFORE I DIE I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE NAME YOU GIVE TO SUCH CONDUCT THAT WILL NOT TAKE LONG TO SAY OLD FRIEND ANSWERED THE BEECHES
8226-274369-0000 EVERY MEASURE PURSUED BY THE COMMONS
8226-274369-0001 BESIDES NUMBERLESS VEXATIONS AND PERSECUTIONS WHICH THE CLERGY UNDERWENT FROM THE ARBITRARY POWER OF THE LOWER HOUSE THE PEERS WHILE THE KING WAS IN SCOTLAND
8226-274369-0002 HAVING PASSED AN ORDER FOR THE OBSERVANCE OF THE LAWS WITH REGARD TO PUBLIC WORSHIP THE COMMONS ASSUMED SUCH AUTHORITY THAT BY A VOTE ALONE OF THEIR HOUSE THEY SUSPENDED THOSE LAWS THOUGH ENACTED BY THE WHOLE LEGISLATURE
8226-274369-0003 THEY COMPLAINED OF THE KING'S FILLING FIVE VACANT SEES AND CONSIDERED IT AS AN INSULT UPON THEM
8226-274369-0004 THEY MADE A DEMAND THE MOST ABSURD IN THE WORLD THAT THE BISHOPS BEING ALL OF THEM PARTIES SHOULD BE REFUSED A VOTE WITH REGARD TO THAT QUESTION AFTER THE RESOLUTION WAS ONCE FORMED BY THE COMMONS
8226-274369-0005 OF INVADING THE ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT OF CHURCH AND STATE IT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED THAT THEIR PROCEEDINGS IN SUCH A VIOLENT ATTEMPT WOULD THENCEFORTH BE ALTOGETHER REGULAR AND EQUITABLE BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT
8226-274369-0006 IN THEIR ATTACK ON THE HIERARCHY THEY STILL MORE OPENLY PASSED ALL BOUNDS OF MODERATION AS SUPPOSING NO DOUBT
8226-274369-0007 HAD ALREADY RISEN TO A GREAT HEIGHT AND GAVE SUFFICIENT WARNING OF THEIR FUTURE ATTEMPTS UPON THAT ORDER THEY MUTTERED SOMEWHAT OF THEIR REGRET THAT THEY SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO SAVE THE KINGDOM ALONE
8226-274369-0008 AND THAT THE HOUSE OF PEERS WOULD HAVE NO PART IN THE HONOR NAY THEY WENT SO FAR AS OPENLY TO TELL THE LORDS THAT THEY THEMSELVES WERE THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY OF THE WHOLE KINGDOM
8226-274369-0009 AND THAT THE PEERS WERE NOTHING BUT INDIVIDUALS WHO HELD THEIR SEATS IN A PARTICULAR CAPACITY AND THEREFORE IF THEIR LORDSHIPS WILL NOT CONSENT TO THE PASSING OF ACTS NECESSARY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE PEOPLE THE COMMONS
8226-274369-0010 TOGETHER WITH SUCH OF THE LORDS AS ARE MORE SENSIBLE OF THE DANGER MUST JOIN TOGETHER AND REPRESENT THE MATTER TO HIS MAJESTY SO VIOLENT WAS THE DEMOCRATICAL ENTHUSIASTIC SPIRIT DIFFUSED THROUGHOUT THE NATION
8226-274369-0011 THAT A TOTAL CONFUSION OF ALL RANK AND ORDER WAS JUSTLY TO BE APPREHENDED AND THE WONDER WAS NOT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE NOBLES SHOULD SEEK SHELTER UNDER THE THRONE
8226-274369-0012 BUT THE TIDE OF POPULARITY SEIZED MANY AND CARRIED THEM WIDE OF THE MOST ESTABLISHED MAXIMS OF CIVIL POLICY AMONG THE OPPONENTS OF THE KING ARE RANKED THE EARL OF NORTHUMBERLAND LORD ADMIRAL A MAN OF THE FIRST FAMILY AND FORTUNE
8226-274369-0013 AND ENDOWED WITH THAT DIGNIFIED PRIDE WHICH SO WELL BECAME HIS RANK AND STATION THE EARL OF ESSEX WHO INHERITED ALL HIS FATHER'S POPULARITY AND HAVING FROM HIS EARLY YOUTH SOUGHT RENOWN IN ARMS
8226-274369-0014 UNITED TO A MIDDLING CAPACITY THAT RIGID INFLEXIBILITY OF HONOR WHICH FORMS THE PROPER ORNAMENT OF A NOBLEMAN AND A SOLDIER LORD KIMBOLTON SOON AFTER EARL OF MANCHESTER A PERSON DISTINGUISHED BY HUMANITY GENEROSITY
8226-274369-0015 AFFABILITY AND EVERY AMIABLE VIRTUE THESE MEN FINDING THAT THEIR CREDIT RAN HIGH WITH THE NATION VENTURED TO ENCOURAGE THOSE POPULAR DISORDERS WHICH THEY VAINLY IMAGINED
8226-274369-0016 THEY POSSESSED AUTHORITY SUFFICIENT TO REGULATE AND CONTROL IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A MAJORITY IN THE UPPER HOUSE THE COMMONS HAD RECOURSE TO THE POPULACE WHO ON OTHER OCCASIONS HAD DONE THEM SUCH IMPORTANT SERVICE
8226-274369-0017 AMIDST THE GREATEST SECURITY THEY AFFECTED CONTINUAL FEARS OF DESTRUCTION TO THEMSELVES AND THE NATION AND SEEMED TO QUAKE AT EVERY BREATH OR RUMOR OF DANGER
8226-274369-0018 HOWEVER RIDICULOUS WERE WILLINGLY ATTENDED TO AND WERE DISPERSED AMONG THE MULTITUDE TO WHOSE CAPACITY THEY WERE WELL ADAPTED BEALE A TAILOR INFORMED THE COMMONS THAT WALKING IN THE FIELDS
8226-274369-0019 HE HAD HEARKENED TO THE DISCOURSE OF CERTAIN PERSONS UNKNOWN TO HIM AND HAD HEARD THEM TALK OF A MOST DANGEROUS CONSPIRACY A HUNDRED AND EIGHT RUFFIANS AS HE LEARNED HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO MURDER A HUNDRED AND EIGHT LORDS AND COMMONERS
8226-274369-0020 AND WERE PROMISED REWARDS FOR THESE ASSASSINATIONS
8226-274369-0021 FORTY SHILLINGS FOR EACH COMMONER UPON THIS NOTABLE INTELLIGENCE ORDERS WERE ISSUED FOR SEIZING PRIESTS AND JESUITS A CONFERENCE WAS DESIRED WITH THE LORDS
8226-274369-0022 AND THE DEPUTY LIEUTENANTS OF SOME SUSPECTED COUNTIES WERE ORDERED TO PUT THE PEOPLE IN A POSTURE OF DEFENCE THE PULPITS LIKEWISE WERE CALLED IN AID
8226-274369-0023 AND RESOUNDED WITH THE DANGERS WHICH THREATENED RELIGION FROM THE DESPERATE ATTEMPTS OF PAPISTS AND MALIGNANTS MULTITUDES FLOCKED TOWARDS WESTMINSTER AND INSULTED THE PRELATES AND SUCH OF THE LORDS AS ADHERED TO THE CROWN
8226-274369-0024 THE PEERS VOTED A DECLARATION AGAINST THOSE TUMULTS AND SENT IT TO THE LOWER HOUSE BUT THESE REFUSED THEIR CONCURRENCE SOME SEDITIOUS APPRENTICES BEING SEIZED AND COMMITTED TO PRISON IMMEDIATELY RECEIVED THEIR LIBERTY
8226-274369-0025 DURING THIS TIME OF DISORDER AND DANGER OFFERED THEIR SERVICE TO THE KING BETWEEN THEM AND THE POPULACE THERE PASSED FREQUENT SKIRMISHES WHICH ENDED NOT WITHOUT BLOODSHED BY WAY OF REPROACH
8226-274369-0026 THESE GENTLEMEN GAVE THE RABBLE THE APPELLATION OF ROUNDHEADS ON ACCOUNT OF THE SHORT CROPPED HAIR WHICH THEY WORE THESE CALLED THE OTHERS CAVALIERS AND THUS THE NATION
8226-274369-0027 WHICH WAS BEFORE SUFFICIENTLY PROVIDED WITH RELIGIOUS AS WELL AS CIVIL CAUSES OF QUARREL WAS ALSO SUPPLIED WITH PARTY NAMES UNDER WHICH THE FACTIONS MIGHT RENDEZVOUS AND SIGNALIZE THEIR MUTUAL HATRED
8226-274369-0028 BEING DISTINGUISHABLE BY THEIR HABIT AND BEING THE OBJECT OF VIOLENT HATRED TO ALL THE SECTARIES WERE EXPOSED TO THE MOST DANGEROUS INSULTS WILLIAMS NOW CREATED ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
8226-274369-0029 THAT THOUGH THEY HAD AN UNDOUBTED RIGHT TO SIT AND VOTE IN PARLIAMENT YET IN COMING THITHER THEY HAD BEEN MENACED ASSAULTED AFFRONTED BY THE UNRULY MULTITUDE AND COULD NO LONGER WITH SAFETY ATTEND THEIR DUTY IN THE HOUSE
8226-274369-0030 FOR THIS REASON THEY PROTESTED AGAINST ALL LAWS VOTES AND RESOLUTIONS AS NULL AND INVALID WHICH SHOULD PASS DURING THE TIME OF THEIR CONSTRAINED ABSENCE THIS PROTESTATION WHICH
8226-274369-0031 THAT HOUSE DESIRED A CONFERENCE WITH THE COMMONS WHOM THEY INFORMED OF THIS UNEXPECTED PROTESTATION THE OPPORTUNITY WAS SEIZED WITH JOY AND TRIUMPH
8226-274369-0032 THE KING WAS BETRAYED INTO ANOTHER INDISCRETION MUCH MORE FATAL AN INDISCRETION TO WHICH ALL THE ENSUING DISORDERS AND CIVIL WARS OUGHT IMMEDIATELY AND DIRECTLY TO BE ASCRIBED
8226-274369-0033 THIS WAS THE IMPEACHMENT OF LORD KIMBOLTON AND THE FIVE MEMBERS WHEN THE COMMONS EMPLOYED IN THEIR REMONSTRANCE LANGUAGE SO SEVERE AND INDECENT THEY HAD NOT BEEN ACTUATED ENTIRELY BY INSOLENCE AND PASSION
8226-274369-0034 THEIR VIEWS WERE MORE SOLID AND PROFOUND THEY CONSIDERED THAT IN A VIOLENT ATTEMPT SUCH AS AN INVASION OF THE ANCIENT CONSTITUTION THE MORE LEISURE WAS AFFORDED THE PEOPLE TO REFLECT
8226-274369-0035 THE LESS WOULD THEY BE INCLINED TO SECOND THAT RASH AND DANGEROUS ENTERPRISE THAT THE PEERS WOULD CERTAINLY REFUSE THEIR CONCURRENCE NOR WERE THERE ANY HOPES OF PREVAILING ON THEM BUT BY INSTIGATING THE POPULACE TO TUMULT AND DISORDER
8226-274369-0036 THAT THE EMPLOYING OF SUCH ODIOUS MEANS FOR SO INVIDIOUS AN END WOULD AT LONG RUN LOSE THEM ALL THEIR POPULARITY AND TURN THE TIDE OF FAVOR TO THE CONTRARY PARTY AND THAT IF THE KING ONLY REMAINED IN TRANQUILLITY
8226-274369-0037 THEY WERE THEREFORE RESOLVED IF POSSIBLE TO EXCITE HIM TO SOME VIOLENT PASSION
8226-274369-0038 IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY SUCCEEDED BEYOND THEIR FONDEST WISHES CHARLES WAS ENRAGED TO FIND THAT ALL HIS CONCESSIONS BUT INCREASED THEIR DEMANDS
8226-274369-0039 WERE AGAIN ROUSED TO SEDITION AND TUMULTS THAT THE BLACKEST CALUMNIES WERE PROPAGATED AGAINST HIM AND EVEN THE IRISH MASSACRE ASCRIBED TO HIS COUNSELS AND MACHINATIONS
8226-274369-0040 HE WAS APT TO ASCRIBE THEM IN A GREAT MEASURE TO HIS OWN INDOLENCE AND FACILITY THE QUEEN AND THE LADIES OF THE COURT FURTHER STIMULATED HIS PASSION AND REPRESENTED THAT
8226-274369-0041 IF HE EXERTED THE VIGOR AND DISPLAYED THE MAJESTY OF A MONARCH THE DARING USURPATIONS OF HIS SUBJECTS WOULD SHRINK BEFORE HIM LORD DIGBY A MAN OF FINE PARTS BUT FULL OF LEVITY AND HURRIED ON BY PRECIPITATE PASSIONS
8226-274369-0042 THAT THEY HAD TRAITOROUSLY ENDEAVORED TO SUBVERT THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS AND GOVERNMENT OF THE KINGDOM TO DEPRIVE THE KING OF HIS REGAL POWER AND TO IMPOSE ON HIS SUBJECTS AN ARBITRARY AND TYRANNICAL AUTHORITY THAT THEY HAD ENDEAVORED
8226-274369-0043 BY MANY FOUL ASPERSIONS ON HIS MAJESTY AND HIS GOVERNMENT TO ALIENATE THE AFFECTIONS OF HIS PEOPLE AND MAKE HIM ODIOUS TO THEM THAT THEY HAD ATTEMPTED TO DRAW HIS LATE ARMY TO DISOBEDIENCE OF HIS ROYAL COMMANDS
8226-274369-0044 AND TO SIDE WITH THEM IN THEIR TRAITOROUS DESIGNS
8226-274369-0045 SEEM TO BE COMMON BETWEEN THE IMPEACHED MEMBERS AND THE PARLIAMENT
8226-274369-0046 THAN SO FAR AS THEY CONCURRED WITH THE MAJORITY IN THEIR VOTES AND SPEECHES THOUGH PROOFS MIGHT PERHAPS BE PRODUCED OF THEIR PRIVATELY INVITING THE SCOTS TO INVADE ENGLAND
8226-274369-0047 HOW COULD SUCH AN ATTEMPT BE CONSIDERED AS TREASON AFTER THE ACT OF OBLIVION WHICH HAD PASSED AND AFTER THAT BOTH HOUSES WITH THE KING'S CONCURRENCE HAD VOTED THAT NATION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS FOR THEIR BROTHERLY ASSISTANCE
8226-274369-0048 WHILE THE HOUSE OF PEERS ARE SCARCELY ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCY OR TO REJECT THE BILLS SENT THEM BY THE COMMONS WILL THEY EVER BE PERMITTED BY THE POPULACE SUPPOSING THEM INCLINED
8226-274369-0049 BUT SURELY WAS NEVER BEFORE ATTEMPTED IN OPPOSITION TO A FACTION DURING THE FULL TIDE OF ITS POWER AND SUCCESS BUT MEN HAD NOT LEISURE TO WONDER AT THE INDISCRETION OF THIS MEASURE
8226-274369-0050 MESSENGERS WERE EMPLOYED TO SEARCH FOR THEM AND ARREST THEM THEIR TRUNKS CHAMBERS AND STUDIES WERE SEALED AND LOCKED THE HOUSE VOTED ALL THESE ACTS OF VIOLENCE TO BE BREACHES OF PRIVILEGE
8226-274369-0051 AND COMMANDED EVERY ONE TO DEFEND THE LIBERTY OF THE MEMBERS THE KING IRRITATED BY ALL THIS OPPOSITION RESOLVED NEXT DAY TO COME IN PERSON TO THE HOUSE WITH AN INTENTION TO DEMAND PERHAPS SEIZE IN THEIR PRESENCE
8226-274369-0052 THE PERSONS WHOM HE HAD ACCUSED THIS RESOLUTION WAS DISCOVERED TO THE COUNTESS OF CARLISLE SISTER TO NORTHUMBERLAND A LADY OF SPIRIT WIT AND INTRIGUE SHE PRIVATELY SENT INTELLIGENCE TO THE FIVE MEMBERS
8226-274369-0053 AND THEY HAD TIME TO WITHDRAW A MOMENT BEFORE THE KING ENTERED HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS ORDINARY RETINUE TO THE NUMBER OF ABOVE TWO HUNDRED ARMED AS USUAL SOME WITH HALBERTS
8226-274369-0054 YESTERDAY I SENT A SERJEANT AT ARMS TO DEMAND SOME WHO BY MY ORDER WERE ACCUSED OF HIGH TREASON INSTEAD OF OBEDIENCE I RECEIVED A MESSAGE I MUST HERE DECLARE TO YOU
8226-274369-0055 THAT THOUGH NO KING THAT EVER WAS IN ENGLAND COULD BE MORE CAREFUL OF YOUR PRIVILEGES THAN I SHALL BE YET IN CASES OF TREASON NO PERSON HAS PRIVILEGE
8226-274369-0056 I NEVER DID INTEND ANY FORCE BUT SHALL PROCEED AGAINST THEM IN A FAIR AND LEGAL WAY FOR I NEVER MEANT ANY OTHER AND NOW SINCE I SEE I CANNOT DO WHAT I CAME FOR
8226-274369-0057 HE ASKED THE SPEAKER WHO STOOD BELOW WHETHER ANY OF THESE PERSONS WERE IN THE HOUSE THE SPEAKER FALLING ON HIS KNEE PRUDENTLY REPLIED I HAVE SIR
8226-274369-0058 NEITHER EYES TO SEE NOR TONGUE TO SPEAK IN THIS PLACE BUT AS THE HOUSE IS PLEASED TO DIRECT ME WHOSE SERVANT I AM AND I HUMBLY ASK PARDON
8226-274369-0059 WHO WERE APPOINTED FOR THAT PURPOSE OR PERHAPS ACTUATED BY THEIR OWN TERRORS RAN FROM GATE TO GATE CRYING OUT THAT THE CAVALIERS WERE COMING TO BURN THE CITY AND THAT THE KING HIMSELF WAS AT THEIR HEAD
8226-274369-0060 NEXT MORNING CHARLES SENT TO THE MAYOR AND ORDERED HIM TO CALL A COMMON COUNCIL IMMEDIATELY ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK HE HIMSELF ATTENDED ONLY BY THREE OR FOUR LORDS WENT TO GUILDHALL
8226-274369-0061 HE TOLD THE COMMON COUNCIL THAT HE WAS SORRY TO HEAR OF THE APPREHENSIONS ENTERTAINED OF HIM THAT HE WAS COME TO THEM WITHOUT ANY GUARD IN ORDER TO SHOW HOW MUCH HE RELIED ON THEIR AFFECTIONS
8226-274369-0062 AND THAT HE HAD ACCUSED CERTAIN MEN OF HIGH TREASON AGAINST WHOM HE WOULD PROCEED IN A LEGAL WAY AND THEREFORE PRESUMED THAT THEY WOULD NOT MEET WITH PROTECTION IN THE CITY AFTER MANY OTHER GRACIOUS EXPRESSIONS
8226-274369-0063 HE HEARD THE CRY PRIVILEGE OF PARLIAMENT PRIVILEGE OF PARLIAMENT RESOUNDING FROM ALL QUARTERS
8226-274371-0000 YOU SPEAK OF JEALOUSIES AND FEARS LAY YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEARTS AND ASK YOURSELVES WHETHER I MAY NOT LIKEWISE BE DISTURBED WITH FEARS AND JEALOUSIES AND IF SO I ASSURE YOU THAT THIS MESSAGE HAS NOTHING LESSENED THEM
8226-274371-0001 WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE HAVE I VIOLATED YOUR LAWS HAVE I DENIED TO PASS ANY BILL FOR THE EASE AND SECURITY OF MY SUBJECTS I DO NOT ASK WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME
8226-274371-0002 ALL THIS CONSIDERED THERE IS A JUDGMENT OF HEAVEN UPON THIS NATION IF THESE DISTRACTIONS CONTINUE GOD SO DEAL WITH ME AND MINE AS ALL MY THOUGHTS AND INTENTIONS ARE UPRIGHT FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE TRUE PROTESTANT PROFESSION
8226-274371-0003 AND FOR THE OBSERVANCE AND PRESERVATION OF THE LAWS AND I HOPE GOD WILL BLESS AND ASSIST THOSE LAWS FOR MY PRESERVATION NO SOONER DID THE COMMONS DESPAIR OF OBTAINING THE KING'S CONSENT TO THEIR BILL THAN THEY INSTANTLY VOTED
8226-274371-0004 THAT THOSE WHO ADVISED HIS MAJESTY'S ANSWER WERE ENEMIES TO THE STATE AND MISCHIEVOUS PROJECTORS AGAINST THE SAFETY OF THE NATION THAT THIS DENIAL IS OF SUCH DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCE THAT IF HIS MAJESTY PERSIST IN IT
8226-274371-0005 IT WILL HAZARD THE PEACE AND TRANQUILLITY OF ALL HIS KINGDOMS UNLESS SOME SPEEDY REMEDY BE APPLIED BY THE WISDOM AND AUTHORITY OF BOTH HOUSES AND THAT SUCH OF THE SUBJECTS AS HAVE PUT THEMSELVES IN A POSTURE OF DEFENCE AGAINST THE COMMON DANGER
8226-274371-0006 WITH THE TERRORS OF INVASION WITH THE DREAD OF ENGLISH AND IRISH PAPISTS AND THE MOST UNACCOUNTABLE PANICS WERE SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE NATION LORD DIGBY HAVING ENTERED KINGSTON IN A COACH AND SIX
8226-274371-0007 ATTENDED BY A FEW LIVERY SERVANTS THE INTELLIGENCE WAS CONVEYED TO LONDON AND IT WAS IMMEDIATELY VOTED THAT HE HAD APPEARED IN A HOSTILE MANNER TO THE TERROR AND AFFRIGHT OF HIS MAJESTY'S SUBJECTS
8226-274371-0008 HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT TO OPEN THE EYES OF MANY AND TO RECOVER THEM FROM THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH AT FIRST THEY HAD BEEN SEIZED
8226-274371-0009 AND THEY PROCEEDED TO FRAME AN ORDINANCE IN WHICH BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE TWO HOUSES WITHOUT THE KING'S CONSENT THEY NAMED LIEUTENANTS FOR ALL THE COUNTIES AND CONFERRED ON THEM THE COMMAND OF THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE OF ALL THE GUARDS
8226-274371-0010 GARRISONS AND FORTS OF THE KINGDOM HE ISSUED PROCLAMATIONS AGAINST THIS MANIFEST USURPATION
8226-274371-0011 AS HE PROFESSED A RESOLUTION STRICTLY TO OBSERVE THE LAW HIMSELF SO WAS HE DETERMINED HE SAID TO OBLIGE EVERY OTHER PERSON TO PAY IT A LIKE OBEDIENCE THE NAME OF THE KING WAS SO ESSENTIAL TO ALL LAWS
8226-274371-0012 AND SO FAMILIAR IN ALL ACTS OF EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY THAT THE PARLIAMENT WAS AFRAID HAD THEY TOTALLY OMITTED IT THAT THE INNOVATION WOULD BE TOO SENSIBLE TO THE PEOPLE IN ALL COMMANDS THEREFORE WHICH THEY CONFERRED
8226-274371-0013 THEY BOUND THE PERSONS TO OBEY THE ORDERS OF HIS MAJESTY SIGNIFIED BY BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT AND INVENTING A DISTINCTION HITHERTO UNHEARD OF BETWEEN THE OFFICE AND THE PERSON OF THE KING
8226-274371-0014 THOSE VERY FORCES WHICH THEY EMPLOYED AGAINST HIM THEY LEVIED IN HIS NAME AND BY HIS AUTHORITY IT IS REMARKABLE HOW MUCH THE TOPICS OF ARGUMENT WERE NOW REVERSED BETWEEN THE PARTIES THE KING
