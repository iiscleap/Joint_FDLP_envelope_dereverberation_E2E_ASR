5339-14134-0073 AT LENGTH HE RAISED HIS STIFFENED BODY AND STOOD UP DIZZY UP THE LITTLE WOODEN STAIRS HE WENT WHERE HE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE TO THE SMALL SQUARE LANDING ALMOST FILLED UP WITH THE GREAT CHEST FOR OAT CAKE HE BREATHED HARD FOR A MINUTE AND THEN KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF SYLVIA'S ROOM

5339-14134-0076 AND GOD BLESS YO I'M SORRY I VEXED YO NO REPLY WITH A HEAVY HEAVY HEART HE CREAKED DOWN THE STAIRS FELT FOR HIS CAP AND LEFT THE HOUSE
5339-14134-0077 THE NEED FOR HIS DEPARTURE AND YET HE STOOD STILL FOR A LITTLE TIME LIKE ONE ENTRANCED AS IF HIS WILL HAD LOST ALL POWER TO COMPEL HIM TO LEAVE THE PLACE THOSE TWO WORDS OF HERS WHICH TWO HOURS BEFORE WOULD HAVE BEEN SO FAR BENEATH HIS ASPIRATIONS
5339-14134-0078 AND TOUCHED HER PRIDE MAYBE TOO
5339-14134-0079 AND I'LL BE HOME AGAIN AS SOON AS IVER I CAN IN HALF A YEAR SUCH AS HE FORGETS IF IVER HE'S THOUGHT SERIOUS ABOUT HER BUT IN A MY LIFETIME IF I LIVE TO FOURSCORE I CAN NIVER FORGET
5390-24512-0000 FOR ALTHOUGH THE JEWISH FAMILY OF THE HERODS REIGNED OVER JUDEA THEY ONLY HELD THEIR THRONE UNDER THE ROMAN EMPEROR THIS THE JEWS COULD NOT ENDURE THEY LONGED TO BE A FREE AND INDEPENDENT NATION ONCE AGAIN
5390-24512-0001 WHEN OUR MESSIAH COMES HE WILL BE A GREAT WARRIOR THEY SAID HE WILL UTTERLY DESTROY ALL OUR ENEMIES HE WILL MAKE JERUSALEM THE GREATEST AND RICHEST CITY
5390-24512-0002 HAD JESUS OF NAZARETH BEEN WILLING TO BECOME THEIR EARTHLY KING AND TO LEAD THE NATION AGAINST THE ROMANS THE JEWS WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FOLLOWED HIM TO A MAN
5390-24512-0003 THE SAVIOUR SOUGHT TO HEAL IT HE CALLED OUT THE FAITH AND GRATITUDE OF THE ROMAN CENTURION AND HIS ANSWER TO THE JEWISH LEADERS RENDER TO CAESAR THE THINGS THAT ARE CAESAR'S
5390-24512-0004 SHOWED THEM THE RIGHT ATTITUDE IN WHICH TO REGARD THE ROMAN RULE
5390-24512-0005 THE ROMAN GOVERNMENT HAD NO QUARREL WITH HIM THINE OWN NATION HATH DELIVERED THEE UNTO ME
5390-24512-0006 HAD NOT THE JEWS PREVENTED IT IF THOU LET THIS MAN GO THOU ART NOT CAESAR'S FRIEND THEY CRIED
5390-24512-0007 TO CRUCIFY JESUS OF NAZARETH AND TO FREE BARABBAS BUT IN CHOOSING THE REBEL BARABBAS
5390-24512-0008 AS THEIR HERO THE NATION STARTED ON THEIR DOWNWARD ROAD AS THE STORY OF THE FORTY YEARS WHICH FOLLOWED THE SAVIOUR'S CRUCIFIXION CLEARLY SHOWS FOR THE JEWS WERE DETERMINED AT ALL COSTS TO THROW OFF THE ROMAN YOKE
5390-24512-0009 AND THE HISTORY OF THOSE YEARS IS ONE LONG LIST OF TERRIBLE RISINGS AND MASSACRES WHILE CITIES WERE RUINED VILLAGES WRAPPED IN FLAMES AND MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN PERISHED WITH HUNGER
5390-24512-0010 YET THE KEENER THE SUFFERING THE MORE DESPERATE THE JEWS BECAME THEIR WHOLE SOULS WERE POSSESSED WITH A WILD AND MAD PASSION FOR REVENGE
5390-24512-0011 THEN IF ANY MAN SHALL SAY UNTO YOU LO HERE IS CHRIST OR THERE BELIEVE IT NOT MATTHEW
5390-24512-0012 YET NO SOONER DID A DARING REBEL OR MURDERER GATHER A BAND OF ROBBERS AROUND HIM AND BEGIN TO KILL AND PLUNDER THAN MULTITUDES OF JEWS CRIED THE CHRIST OR MESSIAH HAS COME
5390-24512-0013 WHERE THE ROMAN SOLDIERS WERE QUARTERED AND CRIED OUT TO THE GARRISON WITHIN THAT THEIR LIVES SHOULD BE SPARED IF THEY WOULD LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS THE ROMAN SOLDIERS HESITATED BUT THE JEWS PROMISED MOST FAITHFULLY TO KEEP THEIR WORD
5390-24512-0014 THE ROMANS BELIEVED THEM AND OPENED THEIR GATES BUT NO SOONER WERE THEY IN THE POWER OF THE JEWISH MOB THAN THEY WERE FALLEN UPON AND MURDERED TO THE LAST MAN AS THEY DIED THE ROMAN SOLDIERS WHOM NOT EVEN DEATH COULD TERRIFY
5390-24512-0015 LIFTED UP THEIR HANDS TO HEAVEN AS THOUGH CALLING UPON GOD TO WITNESS THAT THE JEWS HAD BROKEN THEIR SOLEMN OATH THE ROMAN EMPEROR COULD NOT OVERLOOK SUCH REBELLION AND TREACHERY
5390-24512-0016 AND HE SENT A GREAT ARMY AGAINST JERUSALEM THE JEWS SHUT THE GATES OF THEIR CITY AND SO BEGAN THE AWFUL SIEGE OF JERUSALEM AND WHEN YE SHALL SEE JERUSALEM COMPASSED WITH ARMIES
5390-24512-0017 HE WAS A PRISONER IN THE ROMAN CAMP DURING THE SIEGE OF JERUSALEM AND HE WATCHED WITH DISMAY THE GREAT BATTERING RAMS AND WAR ENGINES CRASHING THROUGH THE WALLS OF THE HOLY CITY HIS EARS RANG WITH THE CRIES OF RAGE AND DESPAIR WHICH BROKE FROM THE JEWS WITHIN
5390-24512-0018 AS ONE BY ONE THEIR DEFENCES FELL AND THE END DREW NEAR THEN FOOD FAILED IN THE CITY MEN FOUGHT LIKE DEMONS IN THE STREETS FOR A TINY LOAF OF BARLEY BREAD SO FRANTIC WERE THE PEOPLE WITH HUNGER
5390-24512-0019 THAT MOTHERS EVEN SNATCHED THE BREAD FROM THEIR OWN CHILDREN'S MOUTHS LOOK OVER THE WALLS O PEOPLE OF JERUSALEM THE ROMAN SOLDIERS ARE CRUCIFYING ALL THE PRISONERS THEY HAVE TAKEN AND THE LINE OF CROSSES IS AS LONG AS OUR CITY IS WIDE
5390-24512-0020 HARD MERCILESS AS WAS THE ROMAN GENERAL EVEN HE GREW SICK WITH HORROR AT LAST AND HE SENT HIS JEWISH PRISONER JOSEPHUS TO THE JEWS PROMISING THEM THEIR LIVES IF THEY WOULD GIVE UP THE CITY
5390-24512-0021 BUT A FURIOUS MADNESS HAD POSSESSED THE PEOPLE AND THEY REFUSED TO YIELD JOSEPHUS PLEADED IN VAIN HE WAS NOT A CHRISTIAN BUT HE COULD SEE PLAINLY ENOUGH THAT GOD WAS NO LONGER WITH HIS PEOPLE
5390-24512-0022 AH MY COUNTRYMEN HE CRIED WE DID NOTHING WITHOUT GOD IN THE PAST BUT NOW YOU ARE FIGHTING AGAINST HIM HAD GOD JUDGED YOU WORTHY OF FREEDOM HE WOULD HAVE PUNISHED THE ROMANS AS HE DID THE ASSYRIANS LONG AGO
5390-24512-0023 EVEN A JEW WHO HAD NO FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST COULD SEE PLAINLY THAT THE ANCIENT POWER AND GLORY OF HIS NATION HAD GONE AT LAST THE END CAME THE FIRST WALL FELL
5390-24512-0024 WHICH STILL GLITTERED LIKE A HILL OF SNOW IN THE MORNING SUNSHINE OR SPARKLED AS THOUGH WRAPPED IN FLAME WHEN THE SUNBEAMS STRUCK FULL ON ITS GOLDEN ROOF THEN REDDER FLAMES THAN EVER THE SUNSHINE MADE LEAPT ABOVE THE GOLDEN ROOF
5390-24512-0025 PILLARS FELL BEAMS CRUMBLED TO ASHES WHILE ROUND THE ALTAR OF SACRIFICE THE PEOPLE OF JERUSALEM LAY HEAPED TOGETHER SLAIN IN SUCH NUMBERS IN THE HOLY PLACE THAT THEIR BLOOD FLOWED DOWN THE BROAD MARBLE STEPS IN A HEAVY CRIMSON STREAM
5390-24512-0026 AND THE GOLDEN CANDLESTICK AND THE BOOK OF THE LAW WERE CARRIED AWAY IN TRIUMPH INTO HEATHEN ROME ALAS FOR THE HOLY CITY OVER WHICH THE SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD HAD STOOD AND WEPT FORTY YEARS BEFORE
5390-24512-0027 KNOWING THE SUFFERING THAT LAY BEFORE HER THESE JEWS ARE DANGEROUS WE MUST NOT ALLOW THEM TO REBUILD THEIR CITY OR TO BECOME A SEPARATE PEOPLE AGAIN AS A NATION THEY MUST CEASE TO EXIST
5390-24512-0028 SO THE ROMAN CONQUERORS OF JERUSALEM AGREED AND FROM THAT DAY ONWARD THE JEWISH PEOPLE HAVE HAD NO COUNTRY OF THEIR OWN THEY HAVE INDEED BEEN LED AWAY CAPTIVE INTO ALL NATIONS
5390-24512-0029 EXACTLY AS THE LORD FORETOLD THERE IS SCARCELY A COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE JEWS MAY NOT BE FOUND BUT JERUSALEM LIES STILL IN THE HANDS OF STRANGERS AND IS THE PROPERTY OF THE TURKISH NATION
5390-24512-0030 THE JEWS WERE NOW NO LONGER A NATION THEY HAD BECOME MERELY A BODY OF PEOPLE LED BY THEIR RABBIS OR TEACHERS OF THE LAW BUT THEY WERE STILL THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK
5390-24512-0031 THEY ALLOWED THE JEWISH TEACHERS TO CONTINUE THE SYNAGOGUE SERVICES IN OTHER PARTS OF PALESTINE AND TO TEACH IN THEIR COLLEGES THE MOST FAMOUS JEWISH COLLEGE OF THESE DAYS WAS AT TIBERIUS ON THE SHORES OF THE SEA OF GALILEE
5390-24512-0032 OVER WHOSE CLEAR DEPTHS THE LORD JESUS CHRIST HAD SAILED SO OFTEN AND BESIDE WHOSE SHORES HE HAD DONE SO MANY WONDERFUL DEEDS OF LOVE AND MERCY A GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL COLLEGE IT WAS WITH BROAD TERRACED GARDENS
5390-24512-0033 SO ALL DAY LONG THEY STUDIED AND COPIED THE OLD HEBREW BIBLE AS WE HAVE SEEN THE JEWISH SCRIBES HAD NOT BEEN CONTENT WITH TAKING THE WORD OF GOD JUST AS IT STOOD THEY HAD BEGUN EVEN IN OUR LORD'S DAY
5390-24512-0034 THAT THEY DECLARED A MAN TO BE A BLOCKHEAD IF HE KNEW ONLY THE SCRIPTURES AND NOT THE TALMUD EXPLANATION THE LAW OF MOSES IS LIKE SALT BUT THE TALMUD IS BALMY SPICE THEY WOULD SAY
5390-24512-0035 YET ALTHOUGH THEY HEEDED SO LITTLE THE TRUE MEANING OF GOD'S BOOK THEY GUARDED ITS WORDS MORE AND MORE CAREFULLY AND THE RULES FOR COPYING ANY PORTION OF THE HOLY BOOKS WERE STRICT INDEED MY SON AN OLD TEACHER WOULD SAY TO HIS PUPIL
5390-24512-0036 BEFORE YOU COPY A SINGLE WORD YOU MUST WASH YOUR BODY ALL OVER AND CLOTHE YOURSELF IN FULL JEWISH DRESS PREPARING YOUR MIND WITH SOLEMN THOUGHTS THE PARCHMENT YOU WRITE UPON MUST BE MADE FROM THE SKINS OF CLEAN ANIMALS ONLY
5390-24512-0037 THAT IS CLEAN ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF MOSES THE INK YOU WRITE WITH MUST BE OF A PURE BLACK MADE ONLY FROM A MIXTURE OF SOOT CHARCOAL AND HONEY
5390-24512-0038 THOUGH YOU KNOW THE WHOLE BOOK OF THE LAW BY HEART YOU MUST NOT WRITE A SINGLE WORD FROM MEMORY BUT RAISE YOUR EYES TO YOUR COPY AND PRONOUNCE THE WORD ALOUD BEFORE TRUSTING IT TO YOUR PEN
5390-24512-0039 BEFORE WRITING ANY OF THE NAMES OF GOD YOU MUST WASH YOUR PEN BEFORE WRITING HIS MOST SACRED NAME YOU MUST WASH YOUR WHOLE BODY IF AFTER YOUR COPY HAS ITSELF BEEN EXAMINED THREE CORRECTIONS HAVE TO BE MADE
5390-24512-0040 THAT COPY MUST BE DESTROYED NOT SATISFIED WITH ALL THESE DIRECTIONS THE MASTER TAUGHT HIS SCHOLAR TO COUNT THE LETTERS OF EVERY BOOK
5390-24512-0041 IS THE MIDDLE LETTER OF ALL THE FIVE BOOKS OF MOSES
5390-24512-0042 IS THE MIDDLE OF ALL THE WORDS
5390-24512-0043 IS THE VERY CENTRE OF ALL THE VERSES THE LETTER A THAT IS THE HEBREW LETTER WHICH STANDS FOR A OCCURS FORTY TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN TIMES THE LETTER B THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN
5390-24512-0044 AND SO ON NOT ONLY THIS BUT EVERY SCRIBE WAS REQUIRED TO KNOW FROM MEMORY EXACTLY HOW MANY LETTERS OF EACH KIND THERE SHOULD BE IN HIS SHEET BEFORE HE BEGAN TO WRITE EVERY SHEET OF PARCHMENT MUST CONTAIN AN EQUAL NUMBER OF LINES
5390-24512-0045 AND THE BREADTH OF EACH COLUMN HAD TO BE THIRTY LETTERS WIDE THERE ARE ELEVEN VERSES IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW BEGINNING AND ENDING WITH N THERE ARE FORTY VERSES IN WHICH LO IS READ THREE TIMES AND SO ON AND SO ON
5390-24512-0046 HOW TEDIOUS AND MEANINGLESS SUCH INFORMATION APPEARS OF WHAT VALUE WERE ALL THESE DETAILS TO SPEND ALL HIS DAYS IN LEARNING SUCH THINGS AS THESE COULD HAVE NO INFLUENCE ON A MAN'S CHARACTER NOR MAKE HIM A POWER FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD
5390-24512-0047 NOT FOR THIS PURPOSE HAD GOD REVEALED HIS WILL TO MAN SOME YEARS AGO IN THE COFFIN OF AN EGYPTIAN MUMMY A LITTLE JAR OF WHEAT WAS FOUND FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS IT HAD LAIN THERE SHUT UP IN THE DARK
5390-24512-0048 WHILE OUT IN THE FIELDS THE CORN WHICH HAD BEEN SOWN HAD GROWN UP AND BEEN REAPED EVERY YEAR AND MEN AND WOMEN HAD BEEN FED BUT THIS JAR OF CORN WAS USELESS BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN PREVENTED FROM DOING THE WORK IN THE WORLD FOR WHICH IT WAS CREATED
5390-24512-0049 JUST SO WAS IT WITH THE HEBREW COPIES OF GOD'S WORD LOCKED UP IN A DEAD LANGUAGE KEPT CLOSE AWAY FROM THE WORLD THEY WERE LIKE THE JAR OF WHEAT WHICH COULD NOT GROW
5390-30096-0000 CHAPTER ONE UNCLE JOHN'S FARM HOW DID I HAPPEN TO OWN A FARM ASKED UNCLE JOHN INTERRUPTING HIS SOUP LONG ENOUGH TO FIX AN INQUIRING GLANCE UPON MAJOR DOYLE WHO SAT OPPOSITE
5390-30096-0001 REPLIED THE MAJOR COMPOSEDLY IT'S A PART OF MY DUTY IN ATTENDING TO THOSE AFFAIRS YOU WON'T LOOK AFTHER YOURSELF TO LEND CERTAIN SUMS OF YOUR MONEY TO NEEDY AND AMBITIOUS YOUNG MEN WHO WANT A START IN LIFE OH UNCLE
5390-30096-0002 DO YOU DO THAT EXCLAIMED MISS PATRICIA DOYLE WHO SAT BETWEEN HER UNCLE AND FATHER AND KEPT AN ACTIVE EYE UPON BOTH SO THE MAJOR SAYS ANSWERED UNCLE JOHN DRYLY AND IT'S TRUE
5390-30096-0003 ASSERTED THE OTHER HE'S ASSISTED THREE OR FOUR SCORE YOUNG MEN TO START IN BUSINESS IN THE LAST YEAR TO MY CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE BY LENDING THEM SUMS RANGING FROM ONE TO THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS
5390-30096-0004 AND IT'S THE MOST WASTEFUL AND EXTRAVAGANT CHARITY I EVER HEARD OF BUT I'M SO GLAD CRIED PATSY CLAPPING HER HANDS WITH A DELIGHTED GESTURE IT'S A SPLENDID WAY TO DO GOOD
5390-30096-0005 WITHOUT CAPITAL YOU KNOW MANY A YOUNG FELLOW WOULD NEVER GET HIS FOOT ON THE FIRST ROUND OF THE LADDER AND MANY WILL NEVER GET IT THERE IN ANY EVENT DECLARED THE MAJOR WITH A SHAKE OF HIS GRIZZLED HEAD
5390-30096-0006 AND HOW CAN I TELL WHETHER THEY'RE DESARVING OR NOT RETORTED MAJOR DOYLE FIERCELY DO YE WANT ME TO BECOME A SLEUTH OR ENGAGE DETECTIVES TO TRACK THE OBJECTS OF YOUR ERRONEOUS PHILANTHROPY
5390-30096-0007 I JUST HAVE TO FORM A JUDGMENT AN TAKE ME CHANCES AND WHIN A POOR DEVIL GOES WRONG
5390-30096-0008 BUT SOME OF THEM MUST SUCCEED VENTURED PATSY IN A CONCILIATORY TONE SOME DO SAID JOHN MERRICK AND THAT REPAYS ME FOR ALL MY TROUBLE
5390-30096-0009 QUERIED THE MAJOR YOU MANE ALL MY THROUBLE WELL AND YOUR MONEY
5390-30096-0010 WITH ONE THING AND ANOTHER WHAT OF IT RETORTED THE LITTLE ROUND FACED MILLIONAIRE LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND STARING FIXEDLY AT THE OTHER THAT'S WHAT I EMPLOY YOU FOR NOW NOW GENTLEMEN CRIED PATSY EARNESTLY
5390-30096-0011 OF HIS FALLING DOWN AND WORSHIPING HIM JOHN MERRICK WAS A MULTI MILLIONAIRE TO BE SURE BUT THERE WERE PALLIATING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ALMOST EXCUSED HIM HE HAD BEEN SO BUSILY OCCUPIED IN INDUSTRY
5390-30096-0012 THAT HE NEVER NOTICED HOW HIS WEALTH WAS PILING UP UNTIL HE DISCOVERED IT BY ACCIDENT THEN HE PROMPTLY RETIRED TO GIVE THE OTHER FELLOWS A CHANCE AND HE NOW DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO SIMPLE ACTS OF CHARITY
5390-30096-0013 AND THE WELFARE AND ENTERTAINMENT OF HIS THREE NIECES HE HAD RESCUED MAJOR DOYLE AND HIS DAUGHTER FROM A LOWLY CONDITION AND PLACED THE FORMER IN THE GREAT BANKING HOUSE OF ISHAM MARVIN AND COMPANY
5390-30096-0014 SIMPLE IN HIS TASTES MODEST AND RETIRING LACKING THE EDUCATION AND REFINEMENTS OF POLITE SOCIETY BUT SHREWD AND EXPERIENCED IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE WORLD THE LITTLE MAN FOUND HIS GREATEST ENJOYMENT IN THE FAMILY CIRCLE
5390-30096-0015 THAT HE HAD BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN FOUNDING BEING NO LONGER ABSORBED IN BUSINESS HE HAD COME TO DETEST ITS EVERY DETAIL AND SO ALLOWED HIS BANKERS TO CARE FOR HIS FORTUNE AND HIS BROTHER IN LAW TO DISBURSE HIS INCOME
5390-30096-0016 WHILE HE HIMSELF STROVE TO ENJOY LIFE IN A SHY AND BOYISH FASHION THAT WAS AS UNUSUAL IN A MAN OF HIS WEALTH AS IT WAS ADMIRABLE HE HAD NEVER MARRIED
5390-30096-0017 PATRICIA WAS THE APPLE OF UNCLE JOHN'S EYE AND THE ONE GODDESS ENSHRINED IN HER DOTING FATHER'S HEART GLANCING AT HER
5390-30096-0018 IN HER PLAIN MUSLIN GOWN A STRANGER WOULD BE TEMPTED TO WONDER WHY SHE WAS RED HAIRED FRECKLED AS A ROBIN'S EGG PUG NOSED AND WIDE MOUTHED BUT HER BLUE EYES WERE BEAUTIFUL
5390-30096-0019 AND THEY SPARKLED WITH A COMBINATION OF SAUCY MISCHIEF AND KINDLY CONSIDERATION FOR OTHERS THAT LENT HER FACE AN INDESCRIBABLE CHARM EVERYONE LOVED PATSY DOYLE
5390-30096-0020 AND PEOPLE WOULD GAZE LONGER AT HER SMILING LIPS AND DANCING EYES THAN UPON MANY A MORE HANDSOME BUT LESS ATTRACTIVE FACE SHE WAS NEARLY SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD NOT VERY TALL AND HER FORM TO SPEAK CHARITABLY
5390-30096-0021 HE WANTED CAPITAL TO PATENT THE PUMP AND PUT IT ON THE MARKET THE THING LOOKED PRETTY GOOD JOHN SO I LENT HIM A THOUSAND OF YOUR MONEY QUITE RIGHT RETURNED UNCLE JOHN NODDING BUT PRETTY SOON HE CAME BACK WITH A SAD TALE
5390-30096-0022 HE WAS IN A BAD FIX ANOTHER FELLOW WAS CONTESTING HIS PATENT AND FIGHTING HARD TO HEAD HIM OFF IT WOULD TAKE A LOT OF MONEY TO FIGHT BACK THREE THOUSAND AT LEAST
5390-30096-0023 BUT HE WAS DECENT ABOUT IT AFTER ALL HIS FATHER HAD LEFT HIM A LITTLE FARM AT MILLVILLE HE COULDN'T SAY WHAT IT WAS WORTH BUT THERE WERE SIXTY ACRES AND SOME GOOD BUILDINGS AND HE WOULD DEED IT TO YOU AS SECURITY
5390-30096-0024 IF YOU WOULD LET HIM HAVE THREE THOUSAND MORE SO YOU TOOK THE FARM AND GAVE HIM THE MONEY I DID SIR PERHAPS I AM TO BLAME
5390-30096-0025 MAKING FIVE THOUSAND IN ALL WELL IT'S GONE JOHN AND YOU'VE GOT THE FARM THE OTHER FELLOWS WERE TOO CLEVER FOR MY YOUNG FRIEND JOSEPH WEGG AND KNOCKED OUT HIS PATENT I'M SO SORRY SAID PATSY SYMPATHETICALLY
5390-30096-0026 HE REPLIED WHAT BECAME OF THE YOUNG MAN ASKED THE GIRL HE'S A COMPETENT CHAUFFEUR AND SO HE WENT TO WORK DRIVING AN AUTOMOBILE WHERE IS MILLVILLE INQUIRED UNCLE JOHN THOUGHTFULLY SOMEWHERE AT THE NORTH OF THE STATE I BELIEVE
5390-30096-0027 HAVE YOU INVESTIGATED THE FARM AT ALL I LOOKED UP A REAL ESTATE DEALER LIVING AT MILLVILLE AND WROTE HIM ABOUT THE WEGG FARM HE SAID IF ANY ONE WANTED THE PLACE VERY BADLY IT MIGHT SELL FOR THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS HUMPH
5390-30096-0028 BUT HIS BEST INFORMATION WAS TO THE EFFECT THAT NO ONE WANTED IT AT ALL PATSY LAUGHED POOR UNCLE JOHN SHE SAID THE LITTLE MAN HOWEVER WAS SERIOUS
5390-30096-0029 FOR A TIME HE ATE WITH GREAT DELIBERATION AND REVOLVED AN INTERESTING THOUGHT IN HIS MIND YEARS AGO
5390-30096-0030 BETH IS STILL WITH LOUISE YOU KNOW AND THEY MUST FIND THE CITY DEADLY DULL JUST NOW THE FARM'S THE THING AND THE MAJOR CAN RUN UP TO SEE US FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS IN THE HOT WEATHER AND WE'LL ALL HAVE A GLORIOUS LAZY TIME

5390-30096-0032 YOU TALK AS IF IT WERE A REAL FARM INSTEAD OF A PLACE NO ONE WOULD HAVE AS A GIFT UNCLE JOHN LOOKED SOBER AGAIN ANYONE LIVE ON THE PLACE MAJOR HE INQUIRED
5390-30096-0033 IT'S GONE TO RUIN AND DECAY THE LAST FEW YEARS
5390-30102-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN LOUISE SCENTS A MYSTERY LOUISE MERRICK WAS THE ELDEST OF UNCLE JOHN'S NIECES HAVING JUST PASSED HER EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY
5390-30102-0001 LED A MERE BUTTERFLY EXISTENCE HER TWO COUSINS FRANKLY AGREED THAT LOUISE WAS SHALLOW INSINCERE AND INCLINED TO BE AFFECTED BUT OF THE THREE GIRLS
5390-30102-0002 AND MEN USUALLY ADMIRED HER GRACEFUL FIGURE AND HER PIQUANT PRETTY FACE WITH ITS CROWN OF FLUFFY BLONDE HAIR AND WINNING EXPRESSION THERE WAS A RUMOR THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED TO ARTHUR WELDON
5390-30102-0003 A YOUNG MAN OF POSITION IN THE CITY BUT UNCLE JOHN IGNORED THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING ONE OF HIS CHERISHED NIECES AND DECLARED THAT LOUISE WAS STILL TOO YOUNG TO THINK OF MARRIAGE WHEN AWAY FROM HER FRIVOLOUS MOTHER
5390-30102-0004 AND THE INCONSEQUENT HOME ENVIRONMENTS THE GIRL WAS MORE UNAFFECTED AND NATURAL IN HER WAYS AND HER FAULTS WERE DOUBTLESS MORE THE RESULT OF EDUCATION THAN OF NATURAL TENDENCY ONE THING WAS INDISPUTABLE HOWEVER
5390-30102-0005 LOUISE MERRICK WAS A CLEVER GIRL POSSESSING A QUICK INTELLECT AND A KEEN INSIGHT INTO THE CHARACTER OF OTHERS HER APPARENT SHALLOWNESS WAS A BLIND OF THE SAME CHARACTER AS HER ASSUMED GRACIOUSNESS
5390-30102-0006 AND WHILE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE LOVABLE WITHOUT ANY PRETENCE OR SHAM SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN LOUISE MERRICK AND ALLOW OTHERS TO READ HER AS SHE ACTUALLY WAS PATSY AND BETH THOUGHT THEY KNEW HER
5390-30102-0007 AND ADMIRED OR LIKED RATHER THAN LOVED THEIR COUSIN UNCLE JOHN THOUGHT HE KNEW HER TOO AND WAS VERY PROUD OF HIS ELDEST NIECE IN SPITE OF SOME DISCOVERED QUALITIES THAT WERE NOT WHOLLY ADMIRABLE
5390-30102-0008 AN EXTENSIVE COURSE OF LIGHT LITERATURE NOT VOID OF DETECTIVE STORIES HAD AT THIS MOMENT PRIMED LOUISE WITH ITS INFLUENCE TO THE EXTENT OF INDUCING HER TO SCENT A MYSTERY IN THE HISTORY OF CAPTAIN WEGG
5390-30102-0009 THE PLAIN FOLKS AROUND MILLVILLE MIGHT SPECULATE LISTLESSLY UPON THE QUEER DOIN'S AT THE FARM AND NEVER GET ANYWHERE NEAR THE TRUTH INDEED THE STRANGE OCCURRENCES SHE HAD JUST HEARD
5390-30102-0010 WERE NEARLY FORGOTTEN IN THE COMMUNITY AND SOON WOULD BE FORGOTTEN ALTOGETHER UNLESS THE QUICK EAR OF A YOUNG GIRL HAD CAUGHT THE CLUE SO LONG IGNORED AT FIRST SHE SCARCELY APPRECIATED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE UNDERTAKING
5390-30102-0011 IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT AN EFFORT TO READ TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA CAPTAIN'S ROMANCE WOULD BE A CHARMING DIVERSION WHILE SHE RESIDED AT MILLVILLE AND IN UNDERTAKING THE TASK SHE LAUGHINGLY ACCUSED HERSELF OF BECOMING AN AMATEUR DETECTIVE
5390-30102-0012 AN OCCUPATION THAT PROMISED TO BE THRILLING AND DELIGHTFUL WARNED HOWEVER BY THE REBUFF SHE HAD MET WITH FROM UNCLE JOHN THE GIRL DECIDED NOT TO CONFIDE EITHER HER SUSPICIONS OR HER PROPOSED INVESTIGATION TO ANYONE FOR THE PRESENT
5390-30102-0013 LOUISE SET TO WORK TO TABULATE THE INFORMATION SHE HAD RECEIVED THUS FAR NOTING THE ELEMENT OF MYSTERY EACH FACT EVOLVED FIRST CAPTAIN WEGG MUST HAVE BEEN A RICH MAN IN ORDER TO BUILD THIS HOUSE
5390-30102-0014 SECONDLY THE CAPTAIN A SURLY AND SILENT MAN HAD BROUGHT HITHER PERHAPS BY FORCE A YOUNG WOMAN AS HIS WIFE WHO WAS SO UNHAPPY THAT SHE PINED AWAY AND DIED WHO WAS THIS WOMAN
5390-30102-0015 WHAT HAD RENDERED HER SO UNHAPPY AND DESPAIRING THIRDLY THE CAPTAIN'S ONLY FRIEND HAD BEEN A CRAZY MAN NAMED WILL THOMPSON WAS HE CRAZY BEFORE THE CAPTAIN'S DEATH OR HAD HE BECOME CRAZED AT THAT TIME
5390-30102-0016 THE BOY FLED AND LEFT HIS SWEETHEART WITHOUT A WORD WHY UNLESS SOMETHING HAD OCCURRED THAT RENDERED THEIR MARRIAGE IMPOSSIBLE IN THE FIFTH PLACE THERE WAS OLD HUCKS AND HIS BLIND WIFE TO BE CONSIDERED
5390-30102-0017 WHAT DID THEY KNOW ABOUT THEIR OLD MASTER'S SECRET HISTORY WHAT TRAGIC MEMORIES LURKED BENEATH THE MAN'S PERPETUAL SMILE AND THE WOMAN'S COMPOSED AND SIGHTLESS FACE SURELY THERE WAS ENOUGH HERE TO EXCITE THE CURIOSITY
5390-30102-0018 AND WARRANT AN EFFORT TO UNTANGLE THE MYSTERY AND AS INSTRUMENTS TO THE END THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE AVAILABLE WHO COULD BE OF USE TO HER MC NUTT THE AGENT WHO EVIDENTLY KNEW MORE THAN HE HAD CARED TO TELL OLD HUCKS AND HIS WIFE
5390-30102-0019 AND ETHEL THOMPSON THE SCHOOL TEACHER THERE MIGHT BE OTHERS BUT ONE OR ANOTHER OF THESE FOUR MUST KNOW THE TRUTH AND IT WOULD BE HER PLEASANT DUTY TO OBTAIN A FULL DISCLOSURE SO SHE WAS ANXIOUS TO BEGIN HER INVESTIGATIONS AT ONCE
5390-30102-0020 WHEN HER UNCLE RETURNED FROM HIS VISIT TO THE PIGS LOUISE SAID TO HIM I'VE BEEN THINKING DEAR THAT WE OUGHT TO CALL UPON THAT YOUNG LADY WHO ARRANGED OUR ROOMS AND THANK HER FOR HER KINDNESS THAT'S TRUE HE REPLIED

5393-19218-0000 THE NIGHT OF THE SIXTEENTH TO THE SEVENTEENTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE WAS A BLESSED NIGHT ABOVE ITS SHADOWS HEAVEN STOOD OPEN IT WAS THE WEDDING NIGHT OF MARIUS AND COSETTE THE DAY HAD BEEN ADORABLE
5393-19218-0001 IT HAD NOT BEEN THE GRAND FESTIVAL DREAMED BY THE GRANDFATHER A FAIRY SPECTACLE WITH A CONFUSION OF CHERUBIM AND CUPIDS OVER THE HEADS OF THE BRIDAL PAIR A MARRIAGE WORTHY TO FORM THE SUBJECT OF A PAINTING TO BE PLACED OVER A DOOR BUT IT HAD BEEN SWEET AND SMILING
5393-19218-0002 THE MANNER OF MARRIAGE IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE WAS NOT THE SAME AS IT IS TO DAY FRANCE HAD NOT YET BORROWED FROM ENGLAND THAT SUPREME DELICACY OF CARRYING OFF ONE'S WIFE OF FLEEING
5393-19218-0003 ON COMING OUT OF CHURCH OF HIDING ONESELF WITH SHAME FROM ONE'S HAPPINESS AND OF COMBINING THE WAYS OF A BANKRUPT WITH THE DELIGHTS OF THE SONG OF SONGS PEOPLE HAD NOT YET GRASPED TO THE FULL THE CHASTITY EXQUISITENESS
5393-19218-0004 THE MOST SACRED OF THE SOUVENIRS OF LIFE MINGLED PELL MELL WITH THE TETE A TETE OF THE CONDUCTOR OF THE DILIGENCE AND THE MAID SERVANT OF THE INN IN THIS SECOND HALF OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IN WHICH WE ARE NOW LIVING THE MAYOR AND HIS SCARF THE PRIEST
5393-19218-0005 OATHS TO THE NORMAN HORSES WITH THEIR TAILS KNOTTED UP FALSE GALLOONS VARNISHED HAT LONG POWDERED LOCKS AN ENORMOUS WHIP AND TALL BOOTS FRANCE DOES NOT YET CARRY ELEGANCE TO THE LENGTH OF DOING LIKE THE ENGLISH NOBILITY
5393-19218-0006 AND RAINING DOWN ON THE POST CHAISE OF THE BRIDAL PAIR A HAIL STORM OF SLIPPERS TRODDEN DOWN AT HEEL AND OF WORN OUT SHOES IN MEMORY OF CHURCHILL
5393-19218-0007 WHICH BROUGHT HIM GOOD LUCK OLD SHOES AND SLIPPERS DO NOT AS YET FORM A PART OF OUR NUPTIAL CELEBRATIONS BUT PATIENCE AS GOOD TASTE CONTINUES TO SPREAD WE SHALL COME TO THAT IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO
5393-19218-0008 MARRIAGE WAS NOT CONDUCTED AT A FULL TROT STRANGE TO SAY AT THAT EPOCH PEOPLE STILL IMAGINED THAT A WEDDING WAS A PRIVATE AND SOCIAL FESTIVAL THAT A PATRIARCHAL BANQUET DOES NOT SPOIL A DOMESTIC SOLEMNITY THAT GAYETY EVEN IN EXCESS
5393-19218-0009 PROVIDED IT BE HONEST AND DECENT DOES HAPPINESS NO HARM AND THAT IN SHORT IT IS A GOOD AND A VENERABLE THING THAT THE FUSION OF THESE TWO DESTINIES WHENCE A FAMILY IS DESTINED TO SPRING SHOULD BEGIN AT HOME AND THAT THE HOUSEHOLD SHOULD THENCEFORTH
5393-19218-0010 NATURAL AND COMMONPLACE AS THIS MATTER OF MARRYING IS THE BANNS TO PUBLISH THE PAPERS TO BE DRAWN UP THE MAYORALTY AND THE CHURCH PRODUCE SOME COMPLICATION THEY COULD NOT GET READY BEFORE THE SIXTEENTH OF FEBRUARY
5393-19218-0011 NOW WE NOTE THIS DETAIL FOR THE PURE SATISFACTION OF BEING EXACT IT CHANCED
5393-19218-0012 AS THE MARRIAGE WAS TAKING PLACE UNDER THE REGIME OF COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY THE PAPERS HAD BEEN SIMPLE
5393-19218-0013 AN ACCIDENT HAPPENED TO JEAN VALJEAN HE CRUSHED THE THUMB OF HIS RIGHT HAND
5393-19218-0014 NOR EVEN TO SEE HIS HURT NOT EVEN COSETTE NEVERTHELESS THIS HAD FORCED HIM TO SWATHE HIS HAND IN A LINEN BANDAGE AND TO CARRY HIS ARM IN A SLING AND HAD PREVENTED HIS SIGNING M GILLENORMAND
5393-19218-0015 IN HIS CAPACITY OF COSETTE'S SUPERVISING GUARDIAN HAD SUPPLIED HIS PLACE WE WILL NOT CONDUCT THE READER EITHER TO THE MAYOR'S OFFICE OR TO THE CHURCH ONE DOES NOT FOLLOW A PAIR OF LOVERS TO THAT EXTENT
5393-19218-0016 TO THE CHURCH OF SAINT PAUL AT THAT EPOCH
5393-19218-0017 WAS IN PROCESS OF REPAVING IT WAS BARRED OFF
5393-19218-0018 AND JEAN VALJEAN MARIUS STILL SEPARATED FROM HIS BETROTHED ACCORDING TO USAGE DID NOT COME UNTIL THE SECOND
5393-19218-0019 BECAME ENTANGLED IN A LONG PROCESSION OF VEHICLES WHICH FORMED AN ENDLESS CHAIN FROM THE MADELEINE TO THE BASTILLE AND FROM THE BASTILLE TO THE MADELEINE MASKERS ABOUNDED ON THE BOULEVARD
5393-19218-0020 MERRY ANDREW PANTALOON AND CLOWN PERSISTED IN THE GOOD HUMOR OF THAT WINTER OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE PARIS HAD DISGUISED ITSELF AS VENICE SUCH SHROVE TUESDAYS ARE NO LONGER TO BE SEEN NOW A DAYS
5393-19218-0021 ANY ONE IN THESE VEHICLES IS AT ONCE A SPECTATOR AND A SPECTACLE POLICE SERGEANTS MAINTAINED ON THE SIDES OF THE BOULEVARD THESE TWO INTERMINABLE PARALLEL FILES MOVING IN CONTRARY DIRECTIONS AND SAW TO IT THAT NOTHING INTERFERED WITH THAT DOUBLE CURRENT
5393-19218-0022 THOSE TWO BROOKS OF CARRIAGES FLOWING THE ONE DOWN STREAM THE OTHER UP STREAM
5393-19218-0023 EMBLAZONED WITH COATS OF ARMS HELD THE MIDDLE OF THE WAY GOING AND COMING FREELY CERTAIN JOYOUS AND MAGNIFICENT TRAINS NOTABLY
5393-19218-0024 HAD THE SAME PRIVILEGE IN THIS GAYETY OF PARIS ENGLAND CRACKED HER WHIP LORD SEYMOUR'S POST CHAISE HARASSED BY A NICKNAME FROM THE POPULACE PASSED WITH GREAT NOISE IN THE DOUBLE FILE ALONG WHICH THE MUNICIPAL GUARDS GALLOPED LIKE SHEEP DOGS
5393-19218-0025 HONEST FAMILY COACHES LOADED DOWN WITH GREAT AUNTS AND GRANDMOTHERS DISPLAYED AT THEIR DOORS FRESH GROUPS OF CHILDREN IN DISGUISE CLOWNS OF SEVEN YEARS OF AGE COLUMBINES OF SIX RAVISHING LITTLE CREATURES WHO FELT THAT THEY FORMED AN OFFICIAL PART OF THE PUBLIC MIRTH
5393-19218-0026 ONE CARRIAGE DELAYED SUFFICED TO PARALYZE THE WHOLE LINE THEN THEY SET OUT AGAIN ON THE MARCH THE WEDDING CARRIAGES WERE IN THE FILE PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE BASTILLE AND SKIRTING THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BOULEVARD
5393-19218-0027 NEARLY AT THE SAME MOMENT THE OTHER FILE WHICH WAS PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE MADELEINE HALTED ALSO AT THAT POINT OF THE FILE THERE WAS A CARRIAGE LOAD OF MASKERS THESE CARRIAGES OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY THESE WAGON LOADS OF MASKERS
5393-19218-0028 ARE VERY FAMILIAR TO PARISIANS IF THEY WERE MISSING ON A SHROVE TUESDAY OR AT THE MID LENT IT WOULD BE TAKEN IN BAD PART AND PEOPLE WOULD SAY THERE'S SOMETHING BEHIND THAT PROBABLY THE MINISTRY IS ABOUT TO UNDERGO A CHANGE
5393-19218-0029 TOW WIGS PINK TIGHTS DANDIFIED HATS SPECTACLES OF A GRIMACER
5393-19218-0030 TORMENTED WITH A BUTTERFLY SHOUTS DIRECTED AT PEDESTRIANS FISTS ON HIPS BOLD ATTITUDES BARE SHOULDERS IMMODESTY UNCHAINED A CHAOS OF SHAMELESSNESS DRIVEN BY A COACHMAN CROWNED WITH FLOWERS
5393-19218-0031 THIS IS WHAT THAT INSTITUTION WAS LIKE GREECE STOOD IN NEED OF THE CHARIOT OF THESPIS FRANCE STANDS IN NEED OF THE HACKNEY COACH OF VADE EVERYTHING CAN BE PARODIED EVEN PARODY THE SATURNALIA
5393-19218-0032 DISPLAYING HER MARBLE BREAST IN A DIVINE SEMI NUDITY HAVING AT THE PRESENT DAY LOST HER SHAPE UNDER THE SOAKED RAGS OF THE NORTH HAS FINALLY COME TO BE CALLED THE JACK PUDDING THE TRADITION OF CARRIAGE LOADS OF MASKERS RUNS BACK TO THE MOST ANCIENT DAYS OF THE MONARCHY
5393-19218-0033 ALLOT TO THE BAILIFF OF THE PALACE TWENTY SOUS TOURNOIS FOR THREE COACHES OF MASCARADES IN THE CROSS ROADS IN OUR DAY THESE NOISY HEAPS OF CREATURES ARE ACCUSTOMED TO HAVE THEMSELVES DRIVEN IN SOME ANCIENT CUCKOO CARRIAGE WHOSE IMPERIAL THEY LOAD DOWN
5393-19218-0034 OR THEY OVERWHELM A HIRED LANDAU WITH ITS TOP THROWN BACK WITH THEIR TUMULTUOUS GROUPS TWENTY OF THEM RIDE IN A CARRIAGE INTENDED FOR SIX THEY CLING TO THE SEATS TO THE RUMBLE ON THE CHEEKS OF THE HOOD ON THE SHAFTS
5393-19218-0035 ENRICHED WITH SLANG THIS CARRIAGE WHICH HAS BECOME COLOSSAL THROUGH ITS FREIGHT HAS AN AIR OF CONQUEST UPROAR REIGNS IN FRONT TUMULT BEHIND PEOPLE VOCIFERATE SHOUT HOWL
5393-19218-0036 GAYETY ROARS SARCASM FLAMES FORTH JOVIALITY IS FLAUNTED LIKE A RED FLAG TWO JADES THERE DRAG FARCE BLOSSOMED FORTH INTO AN APOTHEOSIS IT IS THE TRIUMPHAL CAR OF LAUGHTER A LAUGHTER THAT IS TOO CYNICAL TO BE FRANK
5393-19218-0037 THERE IS GOVERNMENT THEREIN THERE ONE LAYS ONE'S FINGER ON A MYSTERIOUS AFFINITY BETWEEN PUBLIC MEN AND PUBLIC WOMEN IT CERTAINLY IS SAD THAT TURPITUDE HEAPED UP SHOULD GIVE A SUM TOTAL OF GAYETY
5393-19218-0038 THAT BY PILING IGNOMINY UPON OPPROBRIUM THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE ENTICED THAT THE SYSTEM OF SPYING AND SERVING AS CARYATIDS TO PROSTITUTION SHOULD AMUSE THE RABBLE WHEN IT CONFRONTS THEM
5393-19218-0039 THAT THE CROWD LOVES TO BEHOLD THAT MONSTROUS LIVING PILE OF TINSEL RAGS HALF DUNG HALF LIGHT ROLL BY ON FOUR WHEELS HOWLING AND LAUGHING THAT THEY SHOULD CLAP THEIR HANDS AT THIS GLORY COMPOSED OF ALL SHAMES
5393-19218-0040 THE LAUGHTER OF ALL IS THE ACCOMPLICE OF UNIVERSAL DEGRADATION CERTAIN UNHEALTHY FESTIVALS DISAGGREGATE THE PEOPLE AND CONVERT THEM INTO THE POPULACE AND POPULACES LIKE TYRANTS REQUIRE BUFFOONS THE KING HAS ROQUELAURE
5393-19218-0041 THE POPULACE HAS THE MERRY ANDREW PARIS IS A GREAT MAD CITY ON EVERY OCCASION THAT IT IS A GREAT SUBLIME CITY THERE THE CARNIVAL FORMS PART OF POLITICS PARIS LET US CONFESS IT WILLINGLY ALLOWS INFAMY TO FURNISH IT WITH COMEDY
5393-19218-0042 SHE ONLY DEMANDS OF HER MASTERS WHEN SHE HAS MASTERS ONE THING PAINT ME THE MUD ROME WAS OF THE SAME MIND SHE LOVED NERO NERO WAS A TITANIC LIGHTERMAN
5393-19218-0043 THAT ONE OF THESE SHAPELESS CLUSTERS OF MASKED MEN AND WOMEN DRAGGED ABOUT ON A VAST CALASH SHOULD HALT ON THE LEFT OF THE BOULEVARD WHILE THE WEDDING TRAIN HALTED ON THE RIGHT THE CARRIAGE LOAD OF MASKS
5393-19218-0044 CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE WEDDING CARRIAGE CONTAINING THE BRIDAL PARTY OPPOSITE THEM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BOULEVARD HULLO SAID A MASKER HERE'S A WEDDING A SHAM WEDDING RETORTED ANOTHER WE ARE THE GENUINE ARTICLE AND BEING TOO FAR OFF TO ACCOST THE WEDDING PARTY
5393-19218-0045 AND FEARING ALSO THE REBUKE OF THE POLICE THE TWO MASKERS TURNED THEIR EYES ELSEWHERE AT THE END OF ANOTHER MINUTE THE CARRIAGE LOAD OF MASKERS HAD THEIR HANDS FULL THE MULTITUDE SET TO YELLING WHICH IS THE CROWD'S CARESS TO MASQUERADES
5393-19218-0046 AND THE TWO MASKERS WHO HAD JUST SPOKEN HAD TO FACE THE THRONG WITH THEIR COMRADES AND DID NOT FIND THE ENTIRE REPERTORY OF PROJECTILES OF THE FISHMARKETS TOO EXTENSIVE TO RETORT TO THE ENORMOUS VERBAL ATTACKS OF THE POPULACE A FRIGHTFUL EXCHANGE OF METAPHORS TOOK PLACE
5393-19218-0047 IN THE MEANWHILE TWO OTHER MASKERS IN THE SAME CARRIAGE A SPANIARD WITH AN ENORMOUS NOSE AN ELDERLY AIR AND HUGE BLACK MOUSTACHE AND A GAUNT FISHWIFE WHO WAS QUITE A YOUNG GIRL
5393-19218-0048 AND WHILE THEIR COMPANIONS AND THE PASSERS BY WERE EXCHANGING INSULTS THEY HAD HELD A DIALOGUE IN A LOW VOICE THEIR ASIDE WAS COVERED BY THE TUMULT AND WAS LOST IN IT THE GUSTS OF RAIN HAD DRENCHED THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE WHICH WAS WIDE OPEN

5393-19219-0001 A NECKLACE OF FINE PEARLS A WREATH OF ORANGE FLOWERS ALL THIS WAS WHITE AND FROM THE MIDST OF THAT WHITENESS SHE BEAMED FORTH IT WAS AN EXQUISITE CANDOR EXPANDING AND BECOMING TRANSFIGURED IN THE LIGHT

5393-19219-0006 AFTER HAVING PRONOUNCED BEFORE THE MAYOR AND BEFORE THE PRIEST ALL POSSIBLE YESSES
5393-19219-0007 AND ALL BEING FINISHED COSETTE STILL COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT IT WAS REAL SHE LOOKED AT MARIUS SHE LOOKED AT THE CROWD SHE LOOKED AT THE SKY IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SHE FEARED THAT SHE SHOULD WAKE UP FROM HER DREAM
5393-19219-0008 MARIUS BESIDE COSETTE
5393-19219-0009 AND JEAN VALJEAN SAT OPPOSITE THEM AUNT GILLENORMAND HAD WITHDRAWN ONE DEGREE AND WAS IN THE SECOND VEHICLE MY CHILDREN SAID THE GRANDFATHER HERE YOU ARE MONSIEUR LE BARON
5393-19219-0010 AND COSETTE NESTLING CLOSE TO MARIUS CARESSED HIS EAR WITH AN ANGELIC WHISPER SO IT IS TRUE MY NAME IS MARIUS I AM MADAME THOU THESE TWO CREATURES WERE RESPLENDENT
5393-19219-0011 AND IRRECOVERABLE MOMENT AT THE DAZZLING INTERSECTION OF ALL YOUTH AND ALL JOY THEY REALIZED THE VERSES OF JEAN PROUVAIRE THEY WERE FORTY YEARS OLD TAKEN TOGETHER IT WAS MARRIAGE SUBLIMATED
5393-19219-0012 THESE TWO CHILDREN WERE TWO LILIES THEY DID NOT SEE EACH OTHER THEY DID NOT CONTEMPLATE EACH OTHER COSETTE PERCEIVED MARIUS IN THE MIDST OF A GLORY MARIUS PERCEIVED COSETTE ON AN ALTAR AND ON THAT ALTAR
5393-19219-0013 AND IN THAT GLORY THE TWO APOTHEOSES MINGLING IN THE BACKGROUND ONE KNOWS NOT HOW BEHIND A CLOUD FOR COSETTE IN A FLASH FOR MARIUS THERE WAS THE IDEAL THING THE REAL THING THE MEETING OF THE KISS AND THE DREAM
5393-19219-0014 THE NUPTIAL PILLOW ALL THE TORMENTS THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD PASSED CAME BACK TO THEM IN INTOXICATION IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT THEIR SORROWS THEIR SLEEPLESS NIGHTS THEIR TEARS THEIR ANGUISH THEIR TERRORS
5393-19219-0015 THEIR UNHAPPINESS FORMED A HALO ROUND THEIR HAPPINESS THE LONG AGONY OF THEIR LOVE WAS TERMINATING IN AN ASCENSION IT WAS THE SAME ENCHANTMENT IN TWO SOULS
5393-19219-0016 AND WITH MODESTY IN COSETTE THEY SAID TO EACH OTHER IN LOW TONES WE WILL GO BACK TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR LITTLE GARDEN IN THE RUE PLUMET THE FOLDS OF COSETTE'S GOWN LAY ACROSS MARIUS
5393-19219-0017 ONE POSSESSES AND ONE SUPPOSES ONE STILL HAS TIME BEFORE ONE TO DIVINE THE EMOTION ON THAT DAY OF BEING AT MID DAY AND OF DREAMING OF MIDNIGHT IS INDESCRIBABLE THE DELIGHTS OF THESE TWO HEARTS OVERFLOWED UPON THE CROWD
5393-19219-0018 AND INSPIRED THE PASSERS BY WITH CHEERFULNESS
5393-19219-0019 IN FRONT OF SAINT PAUL TO GAZE THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF THE CARRIAGE AT THE ORANGE FLOWERS QUIVERING ON COSETTE'S HEAD THEN THEY RETURNED HOME
5393-19219-0020 THEY BEHELD THE LIGHT OF A RISING SUN ALL AT ONCE THE CLOCK STRUCK MARIUS GLANCED AT COSETTE'S CHARMING BARE ARM AND AT THE ROSY THINGS WHICH WERE VAGUELY VISIBLE THROUGH THE LACE OF HER BODICE AND COSETTE

5463-39173-0001 INDEED AFTER WHAT MISTER SOWERBY HAD SAID AND AFTER LORD LUFTON'S ASSENT TO IT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS HE CONSIDERED TO DECLINE IT AND THEN TOO MISTER SOWERBY'S PROMISE ABOUT THE BILLS WAS VERY COMFORTABLE TO HIM AFTER ALL
5463-39173-0002 ON THE DAY AFTER HIS RETURN HE RECEIVED PROPER AUTHENTIC TIDINGS OF HIS PRESENTATION TO THE PREBEND HE WAS IN FACT ALREADY PREBENDARY
5463-39173-0003 THE INCOME WAS ALREADY HIS OWN
5463-39173-0004 THE ENJOYMENT OF ONE'S OWN HAPPINESS AT SUCH WINDFALLS DEPENDS SO MUCH ON THE FREE AND FREELY EXPRESSED ENJOYMENT OF OTHERS LADY LUFTON'S CONGRATULATIONS HAD NEARLY MADE HIM THROW UP THE WHOLE THING BUT HIS WIFE'S SMILES RE ENCOURAGED HIM
5463-39173-0005 AND LUCY'S WARM AND EAGER JOY MADE HIM FEEL QUITE DELIGHTED WITH MISTER SOWERBY AND THE DUKE OF OMNIUM AND THEN THAT SPLENDID ANIMAL DANDY CAME HOME TO THE PARSONAGE STABLES MUCH TO THE DELIGHT OF THE GROOM AND GARDENER
5463-39173-0006 WHICH HE HAD BOUGHT FROM MISTER SOWERBY SOME LITTLE TIME SINCE WITH THE OBJECT OF OBLIGING HIM HE MARK INTENDED TO SELL HIM AGAIN AS SOON AS HE COULD DO SO JUDICIOUSLY THIS AS I HAVE SAID ABOVE WAS NOT SATISFACTORY
5463-39173-0007 NEITHER OF THE TWO LADIES AT FRAMLEY PARSONAGE KNEW MUCH ABOUT HORSES OR OF THE MANNER IN WHICH ONE GENTLEMAN MIGHT THINK IT PROPER TO OBLIGE ANOTHER BY PURCHASING THE SUPERFLUITIES OF HIS STABLE BUT THEY DID BOTH FEEL THAT THERE WERE HORSES ENOUGH IN THE PARSONAGE STABLE WITHOUT DANDY
5463-39173-0008 AND THAT THE PURCHASING OF A HUNTER WITH THE VIEW OF IMMEDIATELY SELLING HIM AGAIN WAS TO SAY THE LEAST OF IT AN OPERATION HARDLY CONGENIAL WITH THE USUAL TASTES AND PURSUITS OF A CLERGYMAN I HOPE YOU DID NOT GIVE VERY MUCH MONEY FOR HIM MARK SAID FANNY
5463-39173-0009 NOT MORE THAN I SHALL GET AGAIN SAID MARK
5463-39173-0010 I SUPPOSE I SHALL HAVE TO GO INTO RESIDENCE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SAID MARK RECURRING TO THE MORE AGREEABLE SUBJECT OF THE STALL
5463-39173-0011 THE HOUSE WILL NOT BE FURNISHED WILL IT MARK SAID HIS WIFE I DON'T KNOW HOW WE SHALL GET ON DON'T FRIGHTEN YOURSELVES I SHALL TAKE LODGINGS IN BARCHESTER AND WE SHALL NOT SEE YOU ALL THE TIME SAID MISSUS ROBARTS WITH DISMAY
5463-39173-0012 BUT THE PREBENDARY EXPLAINED THAT HE WOULD BE BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AT FRAMLEY EVERY WEEK AND THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY HE WOULD ONLY SLEEP AT BARCHESTER ON THE SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS AND PERHAPS NOT ALWAYS THEN
5463-39173-0013 THE WORST OF IT IS THAT BOTH OF THEM ARE OBLIGED TO WEAR WIGS SHALL YOU HAVE A HAT MARK WITH CURLY THINGS AT THE SIDE AND STRINGS THROUGH TO HOLD THEM UP ASKED LUCY I FEAR THAT DOES NOT COME WITHIN MY PERQUISITES NOR A ROSETTE
5463-39173-0014 IT WAS NOW THE MONTH OF APRIL AND THE FIELDS WERE BEGINNING TO LOOK GREEN AND THE WIND HAD GOT ITSELF OUT OF THE EAST AND WAS SOFT AND GENIAL AND THE EARLY SPRING FLOWERS WERE SHOWING THEIR BRIGHT COLOURS IN THE PARSONAGE GARDEN AND ALL THINGS WERE SWEET AND PLEASANT
5463-39173-0015 WENT AWAY WHEN THE SPRING CAME LEAVING THEIR HOUSES INNOCENT AND EMPTY THE PARISH DUTY WAS BETTER ATTENDED TO AND PERHAPS DOMESTIC DUTIES ALSO AT SUCH PERIOD HE WAS A PATTERN PARSON AND A PATTERN HUSBAND
5463-39173-0016 ATONING TO HIS OWN CONSCIENCE FOR PAST SHORTCOMINGS BY PRESENT ZEAL AND THEN THOUGH SHE HAD NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED IT TO HERSELF THE ABSENCE OF HER DEAR FRIEND LADY LUFTON WAS PERHAPS IN ITSELF NOT DISAGREEABLE MISSUS ROBARTS DID LOVE LADY LUFTON HEARTILY
5463-39173-0017 INDEED JUST AT THIS MOMENT
5463-39173-0018 DANDY WAS RATHER A THORN IN HIS SIDE THOSE WRETCHED BILLS WERE TO COME DUE EARLY IN MAY AND BEFORE THE END OF APRIL SOWERBY WROTE TO HIM SAYING THAT HE WAS DOING HIS UTMOST TO PROVIDE FOR THE EVIL DAY
5463-39173-0019 BUT THAT IF THE PRICE OF DANDY COULD BE REMITTED TO HIM AT ONCE IT WOULD GREATLY FACILITATE HIS OBJECT NOTHING COULD BE MORE DIFFERENT THAN MISTER SOWERBY'S TONE ABOUT MONEY AT DIFFERENT TIMES WHEN HE WANTED TO RAISE THE WIND EVERYTHING WAS SO IMPORTANT
5463-39173-0020 HASTE AND SUPERHUMAN EFFORTS AND MEN RUNNING TO AND FRO WITH BLANK ACCEPTANCES IN THEIR HANDS COULD ALONE STAVE OFF THE CRACK OF DOOM BUT AT OTHER TIMES WHEN RETALIATORY APPLICATIONS WERE MADE TO HIM
5463-39173-0021 HE COULD PROVE WITH THE EASIEST VOICE AND MOST JAUNTY MANNER THAT EVERYTHING WAS QUITE SERENE NOW AT THIS PERIOD HE WAS IN THAT MOOD OF SUPERHUMAN EFFORTS AND HE CALLED LOUDLY FOR THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS FOR DANDY AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED
5463-39173-0022 MARK COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO SAY THAT HE WOULD PAY NOTHING TILL THE BILLS WERE SAFE AND THEREFORE WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF MISTER FORREST OF THE BANK HE DID REMIT THE PRICE OF DANDY TO HIS FRIEND SOWERBY IN LONDON AND LUCY ROBARTS
5463-39173-0023 SHE HAD DECLARED TO HIM PLAINLY THAT SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM AND COULD NOT LOVE HIM AND HAD THUS THROWN AWAY NOT ONLY RICHES AND HONOUR AND HIGH STATION BUT MORE THAN THAT MUCH WORSE THAN THAT SHE HAD FLUNG AWAY FROM HER THE LOVER TO WHOSE LOVE HER WARM HEART CLUNG
5463-39173-0024 THAT HER LOVE DID CLING TO HIM SHE KNEW EVEN THEN AND OWNED MORE THOROUGHLY AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE SO MUCH HER PRIDE HAD DONE FOR HER AND THAT STRONG RESOLVE THAT LADY LUFTON SHOULD NOT SCOWL ON HER AND TELL HER THAT SHE HAD ENTRAPPED HER SON
5463-39173-0025 I KNOW IT WILL BE SAID OF LORD LUFTON HIMSELF THAT PUTTING ASIDE HIS PEERAGE AND BROAD ACRES AND HANDSOME SONSY FACE HE WAS NOT WORTH A GIRL'S CARE AND LOVE
5463-39173-0026 BUT WHAT WOULD THE WORLD COME TO IF NONE BUT ABSOLUTE TRUE HEROES WERE TO BE THOUGHT WORTHY OF WOMEN'S LOVE WHAT WOULD THE MEN DO AND WHAT OH WHAT WOULD BECOME OF THE WOMEN
5463-39173-0027 LUCY ROBARTS IN HER HEART DID NOT GIVE HER DISMISSED LOVER CREDIT FOR MUCH MORE HEROISM THAN DID TRULY APPERTAIN TO HIM DID NOT PERHAPS GIVE HIM FULL CREDIT FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HEROISM WHICH DID REALLY APPERTAIN TO HIM
5463-39173-0028 TREATS HERSELF AS A FARMER TREATS HIS SHEEP AND OXEN MAKES HARDLY MORE OF HERSELF OF HER OWN INNER SELF IN WHICH ARE COMPRISED A MIND AND SOUL THAN THE POOR WRETCH OF HER OWN SEX WHO EARNS HER BREAD IN THE LOWEST STAGE OF DEGRADATION
5463-39173-0029 BUT A TITLE AND AN ESTATE AND AN INCOME ARE MATTERS WHICH WILL WEIGH IN THE BALANCE WITH ALL EVE'S DAUGHTERS AS THEY DO WITH ALL ADAM'S SONS PRIDE OF PLACE AND THE POWER OF LIVING WELL IN FRONT OF THE WORLD'S EYE ARE DEAR TO US ALL ARE DOUBTLESS INTENDED TO BE DEAR
5463-39173-0030 THE MISTRESS OF SUCH A DESTINY WHAT MORE OR WHAT BETTER COULD THE WORLD HAVE DONE FOR HER AND NOW SHE HAD THROWN ALL THAT ASIDE BECAUSE SHE WOULD NOT ENDURE THAT LADY LUFTON SHOULD CALL HER A SCHEMING ARTFUL GIRL ACTUATED BY THAT FEAR SHE HAD REPULSED HIM WITH A FALSEHOOD
5463-39173-0031 THOUGH THE MATTER WAS ONE ON WHICH IT WAS SO TERRIBLY EXPEDIENT THAT SHE SHOULD TELL THE TRUTH AND YET SHE WAS CHEERFUL WITH HER BROTHER AND SISTER IN LAW
5463-39173-0032 IT WAS WHEN SHE WAS QUITE ALONE AT NIGHT IN HER OWN ROOM OR IN HER SOLITARY WALKS THAT A SINGLE SILENT TEAR WOULD GATHER IN THE CORNER OF HER EYE AND GRADUALLY MOISTEN HER EYELIDS SHE NEVER TOLD HER LOVE NOR DID SHE ALLOW CONCEALMENT TO FEED ON HER DAMASK CHEEK
5463-39173-0033 IN ALL HER EMPLOYMENTS IN HER WAYS ABOUT THE HOUSE AND HER ACCUSTOMED QUIET MIRTH SHE WAS THE SAME AS EVER IN THIS SHE SHOWED THE PECULIAR STRENGTH WHICH GOD HAD GIVEN HER BUT NOT THE LESS DID SHE IN TRUTH MOURN FOR HER LOST LOVE AND SPOILED AMBITION
5463-39173-0034 WE ARE GOING TO DRIVE OVER TO HOGGLESTOCK THIS MORNING FANNY SAID ONE DAY AT BREAKFAST I SUPPOSE MARK YOU WON'T GO WITH US
5463-39173-0035 THE PONY CARRIAGE IS WRETCHED FOR THREE OH AS FOR THAT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE NEW HORSE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CARRY YOU AS FAR AS THAT I HEARD YOU SAY YOU WANTED TO SEE MISTER CRAWLEY SO I DO AND THE NEW HORSE AS YOU CALL HIM SHALL CARRY ME THERE TO MORROW
5463-39173-0036 WILL YOU SAY THAT I'LL BE OVER ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK YOU HAD BETTER SAY EARLIER AS HE IS ALWAYS OUT ABOUT THE PARISH VERY WELL SAY ELEVEN IT IS PARISH BUSINESS ABOUT WHICH I AM GOING SO IT NEED NOT IRK HIS CONSCIENCE TO STAY IN FOR ME
5463-39173-0037 WELL LUCY WE MUST DRIVE OURSELVES THAT'S ALL YOU SHALL BE CHARIOTEER GOING AND THEN WE'LL CHANGE COMING BACK TO ALL WHICH LUCY AGREED AND AS SOON AS THEIR WORK IN THE SCHOOL WAS OVER THEY STARTED
5463-39173-0038 NOT A WORD HAD BEEN SPOKEN BETWEEN THEM ABOUT LORD LUFTON SINCE THAT EVENING NOW MORE THAN A MONTH AGO ON WHICH THEY HAD BEEN WALKING TOGETHER IN THE GARDEN LUCY HAD SO DEMEANED HERSELF ON THAT OCCASION
5463-39173-0039 AS TO MAKE HER SISTER IN LAW QUITE SURE THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO LOVE PASSAGES UP TO THAT TIME AND NOTHING HAD SINCE OCCURRED WHICH HAD CREATED ANY SUSPICION IN MISSUS ROBARTS MIND SHE HAD SEEN AT ONCE THAT ALL THE CLOSE INTIMACY BETWEEN THEM WAS OVER AND THOUGHT THAT EVERYTHING WAS AS IT SHOULD BE
5463-39173-0040 BUT SHE DID NOT BETRAY HERSELF PERHAPS HE MAY SHE SAID AND THEN GAVE THE PONY A LITTLE TOUCH WITH HER WHIP OH LUCY I WON'T HAVE PUCK BEATEN HE WAS GOING VERY NICELY I BEG PUCK'S PARDON
5463-39173-0041 BUT YOU SEE WHEN ONE IS TRUSTED WITH A WHIP ONE FEELS SUCH A LONGING TO USE IT OH BUT YOU SHOULD KEEP IT STILL I FEEL ALMOST CERTAIN THAT LADY LUFTON WOULD LIKE SUCH A MATCH I DARESAY SHE MIGHT MISS GRANTLY WILL HAVE A LARGE FORTUNE I BELIEVE
5463-39173-0042 AND THEN SHE IS QUIET AND RESERVED SHE DOES NOT REQUIRE EXCITEMENT AND I AM SURE IS CONSCIENTIOUS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HER DUTIES VERY CONSCIENTIOUS I HAVE NO DOUBT SAID LUCY WITH SOMETHING LIKE A SNEER IN HER TONE BUT THE QUESTION I SUPPOSE IS
5463-39173-0043 WHETHER LORD LUFTON LIKES HER I THINK HE DOES IN A SORT OF WAY HE DID NOT TALK TO HER SO MUCH AS HE DID TO YOU AH THAT WAS ALL LADY LUFTON'S FAULT BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T HAVE HIM PROPERLY LABELLED
5463-39173-0044 OH BY GOD'S MERCY VERY LITTLE AS FOR ME I SHALL GET OVER IT IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS I DON'T DOUBT THAT'S IF I CAN GET ASS'S MILK AND CHANGE OF AIR WE'LL TAKE YOU TO BARCHESTER FOR THAT BUT AS I WAS SAYING I REALLY DO THINK LORD LUFTON LIKES GRISELDA GRANTLY
5463-39173-0045 THEN I REALLY DO THINK THAT HE HAS UNCOMMON BAD TASTE SAID LUCY WITH A REALITY IN HER VOICE DIFFERING MUCH FROM THE TONE OF BANTER SHE HAD HITHERTO USED WHAT LUCY SAID HER SISTER IN LAW LOOKING AT HER
5463-39173-0046 THERE IS I BELIEVE NOTHING IN HER MENTALLY WHATEVER MAY BE HER MORAL EXCELLENCES TO ME SHE IS MORE ABSOLUTELY LIKE A STATUE THAN ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING I EVER SAW TO SIT STILL AND BE ADMIRED IS ALL THAT SHE DESIRES AND IF SHE CANNOT GET THAT
5463-39173-0047 TO SIT STILL AND NOT BE ADMIRED WOULD ALMOST SUFFICE FOR HER I DO NOT WORSHIP LADY LUFTON AS YOU DO BUT I THINK QUITE WELL ENOUGH OF HER TO WONDER THAT SHE SHOULD CHOOSE SUCH A GIRL AS THAT FOR HER SON'S WIFE THAT SHE DOES WISH IT I DO NOT DOUBT
5463-39173-0048 BUT I SHALL INDEED BE SURPRISED IF HE WISHES IT ALSO AND THEN AS SHE FINISHED HER SPEECH LUCY AGAIN FLOGGED THE PONY THIS SHE DID IN VEXATION BECAUSE SHE FELT THAT THE TELL TALE BLOOD HAD SUFFUSED HER FACE WHY LUCY
5463-39173-0049 IF HE WERE YOUR BROTHER YOU COULD NOT BE MORE EAGER ABOUT IT NO I COULD NOT HE IS THE ONLY MAN FRIEND WITH WHOM I WAS EVER INTIMATE AND I CANNOT BEAR TO THINK THAT HE SHOULD THROW HIMSELF AWAY IT'S HORRIDLY IMPROPER TO CARE ABOUT SUCH A THING I HAVE NO DOUBT
5463-39173-0050 I SHALL NOT BE SATISFIED IT'S NO USE YOUR LOOKING AT ME FANNY YOU WILL MAKE ME TALK OF IT AND I WON'T TELL A LIE ON THE SUBJECT I DO LIKE LORD LUFTON VERY MUCH AND I DO DISLIKE GRISELDA GRANTLY ALMOST AS MUCH
5463-39173-0051 THEREFORE I SHALL NOT BE SATISFIED IF THEY BECOME MAN AND WIFE HOWEVER
5463-39173-0052 THERE WAS THEN NOTHING MORE SAID ON THE SUBJECT AND IN TWO MINUTES THEY ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE OF THE HOGGLESTOCK CLERGYMAN MISSUS CRAWLEY HAD BROUGHT TWO CHILDREN WITH HER WHEN SHE CAME FROM THE CORNISH CURACY TO HOGGLESTOCK AND TWO OTHER BABIES HAD BEEN ADDED TO HER CARES SINCE THEN
5463-39173-0053 ONE OF THESE WAS NOW ILL WITH CROUP AND IT WAS WITH THE OBJECT OF OFFERING TO THE MOTHER SOME COMFORT AND SOLACE THAT THE PRESENT VISIT WAS MADE THE TWO LADIES GOT DOWN FROM THEIR CARRIAGE HAVING OBTAINED THE SERVICES OF A BOY TO HOLD PUCK AND SOON FOUND THEMSELVES IN MISSUS CRAWLEY'S SINGLE SITTING ROOM
5463-39173-0054 WHICH THEY KNEW IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO INTRODUCE IN MISTER CRAWLEY'S PRESENCE SHE AS WE HAVE SAID WAS NOT QUITE SO GAUNT NOT ALTOGETHER SO HAGGARD AS IN THE LATTER OF THOSE DREADFUL CORNISH DAYS LADY LUFTON AND MISSUS ARABIN BETWEEN THEM
5463-39173-0055 AND THE SCANTY COMFORT OF THEIR IMPROVED THOUGH STILL WRETCHED INCOME HAD DONE SOMETHING TOWARDS BRINGING HER BACK TO THE WORLD IN WHICH SHE HAD LIVED IN THE SOFT DAYS OF HER CHILDHOOD BUT EVEN THE LIBERAL STIPEND OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR
5463-39173-0056 LIBERAL ACCORDING TO THE SCALE BY WHICH THE INCOMES OF CLERGYMEN IN SOME OF OUR NEW DISTRICTS ARE NOW APPORTIONED WOULD NOT ADMIT OF A GENTLEMAN WITH HIS WIFE AND FOUR CHILDREN LIVING WITH THE ORDINARY COMFORTS OF AN ARTISAN'S FAMILY
5463-39173-0057 AS REGARDS THE MERE EATING AND DRINKING THE AMOUNTS OF BUTCHER'S MEAT AND TEA AND BUTTER THEY OF COURSE WERE USED IN QUANTITIES WHICH ANY ARTISAN WOULD HAVE REGARDED AS COMPATIBLE ONLY WITH DEMI STARVATION BETTER CLOTHING FOR HER CHILDREN WAS NECESSARY AND BETTER CLOTHING FOR HIM
5463-39173-0058 AS FOR HER OWN RAIMENT THE WIVES OF FEW ARTISANS WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTENT TO PUT UP WITH MISSUS CRAWLEY'S BEST GOWN THE STUFF OF WHICH IT WAS MADE HAD BEEN PAID FOR BY HER MOTHER WHEN SHE WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY BESTOWED UPON HER DAUGHTER HER MODEST WEDDING TROUSSEAU
5463-39173-0059 LUCY HAD NEVER SEEN MISSUS CRAWLEY THESE VISITS TO HOGGLESTOCK WERE NOT FREQUENT AND HAD GENERALLY BEEN MADE BY LADY LUFTON AND MISSUS ROBARTS TOGETHER
5463-39173-0060 ALMOST AS PENNILESS AS THE CURATE HIMSELF THEN THEY WOULD WALK TOGETHER FOR HOURS ALONG THE ROCK BOUND SHORE LISTENING TO THE WAVES DISCUSSING DEEP POLEMICAL MYSTERIES SOMETIMES WITH HOT FURY THEN AGAIN WITH TENDER LOVING CHARITY
5463-39173-0061 BUT ALWAYS WITH A MUTUAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF EACH OTHER'S TRUTH NOW THEY LIVED COMPARATIVELY NEAR TOGETHER BUT NO OPPORTUNITIES AROSE FOR SUCH DISCUSSIONS AT ANY RATE ONCE A QUARTER MISTER CRAWLEY WAS PRESSED BY HIS OLD FRIEND TO VISIT HIM AT THE DEANERY
5463-39173-0062 AND DOCTOR ARABIN HAD PROMISED THAT NO ONE ELSE SHOULD BE IN THE HOUSE IF MISTER CRAWLEY OBJECTED TO SOCIETY BUT THIS WAS NOT WHAT HE WANTED THE FINERY AND GRANDEUR OF THE DEANERY AND THE COMFORT OF THAT WARM SNUG LIBRARY WOULD SILENCE HIM AT ONCE
5463-39173-0063 THEN OLD DAYS WOULD HAVE COME BACK TO THEM BUT NOW ARABIN ALWAYS RIDES ON A SLEEK FINE HORSE NOW A DAYS HE ONCE SAID TO HIS WIFE WITH A SNEER
5463-39174-0000 AT THE END OF THE LAST CHAPTER WE LEFT LUCY ROBARTS WAITING FOR AN INTRODUCTION TO MISSUS CRAWLEY WHO WAS SITTING WITH ONE BABY IN HER LAP WHILE SHE WAS ROCKING ANOTHER WHO LAY IN A CRADLE AT HER FEET MISTER CRAWLEY IN THE MEANWHILE HAD RISEN FROM HIS SEAT WITH HIS FINGER BETWEEN THE LEAVES OF AN OLD GRAMMAR
5463-39174-0001 FOR SHE HAD WORK OF THIS KIND OF HER OWN AT HOME WHICH SHE BY NO MEANS NEGLECTED THOUGH THE ATTENDANCE OF NURSES WAS MORE PLENTIFUL WITH HER THAN AT HOGGLESTOCK MISSUS CRAWLEY DID GET UP AND TOLD LUCY THAT SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE HER AND MISTER CRAWLEY CAME FORWARD GRAMMAR IN HAND LOOKING HUMBLE AND MEEK
5463-39174-0002 THE REALITIES OF LIFE HAD BECOME SO STERN TO HER THAT THE OUTWARD ASPECTS OF THEM WERE AS NOTHING SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED A NEW GOWN BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN USEFUL BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING TO HER IF ALL THE COUNTY KNEW THAT THE ONE IN WHICH SHE WENT TO CHURCH HAD BEEN TURNED THREE TIMES
5463-39174-0003 IT GALLED HIM HOWEVER TO THINK THAT HE AND HIS WERE SO POORLY DRESSED I AM AFRAID YOU CAN HARDLY FIND A CHAIR MISS ROBARTS SAID MISTER CRAWLEY
5463-39174-0004 MOVING A PILE OF RAGGED COVERLESS BOOKS ON TO THE TABLE I HOPE HE'LL FORGIVE ME FOR MOVING THEM THEY ARE NOT BOB'S AT LEAST NOT THE MOST OF THEM BUT MINE SAID THE GIRL BUT SOME OF THEM ARE MINE SAID THE BOY AIN'T THEY GRACE
5463-39174-0005 AND ARE YOU A GREAT SCHOLAR ASKED LUCY DRAWING THE CHILD TO HER I DON'T KNOW SAID GRACE WITH A SHEEPISH FACE I AM IN GREEK DELECTUS AND THE IRREGULAR VERBS GREEK DELECTUS AND THE IRREGULAR VERBS AND LUCY PUT UP HER HANDS WITH ASTONISHMENT
5463-39174-0006 AND SHE KNOWS AN ODE OF HORACE ALL BY HEART SAID BOB AN ODE OF HORACE SAID LUCY STILL HOLDING THE YOUNG SHAMEFACED FEMALE PRODIGY CLOSE TO HER KNEES IT IS ALL THAT I CAN GIVE THEM SAID MISTER CRAWLEY APOLOGETICALLY
5463-39174-0007 A LITTLE SCHOLARSHIP IS THE ONLY FORTUNE THAT HAS COME IN MY WAY AND I ENDEAVOUR TO SHARE THAT WITH MY CHILDREN I BELIEVE MEN SAY THAT IT IS THE BEST FORTUNE ANY OF US CAN HAVE SAID LUCY THINKING HOWEVER IN HER OWN MIND
5463-39174-0008 THAT HORACE AND THE IRREGULAR GREEK VERBS SAVOURED TOO MUCH OF PRECOCIOUS FORCING IN A YOUNG LADY OF NINE YEARS OLD BUT NEVERTHELESS GRACE WAS A PRETTY SIMPLE LOOKING GIRL AND CLUNG TO HER ALLY CLOSELY AND SEEMED TO LIKE BEING FONDLED
5463-39174-0009 SO THAT LUCY ANXIOUSLY WISHED THAT MISTER CRAWLEY COULD BE GOT RID OF AND THE PRESENTS PRODUCED I HOPE YOU HAVE LEFT MISTER ROBARTS QUITE WELL SAID MISTER CRAWLEY WITH A STIFF CEREMONIAL VOICE
5463-39174-0010 YES I HAVE HEARD OF IT SAID MISTER CRAWLEY GRAVELY I HOPE THAT HIS PROMOTION MAY TEND IN EVERY WAY TO HIS ADVANTAGE HERE AND HEREAFTER IT SEEMED HOWEVER TO BE MANIFEST FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH HE EXPRESSED HIS KIND WISHES
5463-39174-0011 THAT HIS HOPES AND EXPECTATIONS DID NOT GO HAND IN HAND TOGETHER BY THE BY HE DESIRED US TO SAY THAT HE WILL CALL HERE TO MORROW AT ABOUT ELEVEN DIDN'T HE SAY FANNY YES
5463-39174-0012 LOOKING UP FOR A MOMENT FROM THE ANXIOUS DISCUSSION IN WHICH SHE WAS ALREADY ENGAGED WITH MISSUS CRAWLEY ON NURSERY MATTERS PRAY TELL HIM SAID MISTER CRAWLEY THAT I SHALL BE HAPPY TO SEE HIM
5463-39174-0013 HIS NEW DUTIES DO NOT DISTURB HIM MUCH AS YET SAID LUCY AND HIS RIDING OVER HERE WILL BE NO TROUBLE TO HIM YES THERE HE HAS THE ADVANTAGE OVER ME I UNFORTUNATELY HAVE NO HORSE
5463-39174-0014 AND THEN LUCY BEGAN PETTING THE LITTLE BOY AND BY DEGREES SLIPPED A SMALL BAG OF GINGERBREAD NUTS OUT OF HER MUFF INTO HIS HANDS SHE HAD NOT THE PATIENCE NECESSARY FOR WAITING AS HAD HER SISTER IN LAW THE BOY TOOK THE BAG PEEPED INTO IT AND THEN LOOKED UP INTO HER FACE
5463-39174-0015 WHAT IS THAT BOB SAID MISTER CRAWLEY GINGERBREAD FALTERED BOBBY FEELING THAT A SIN HAD BEEN COMMITTED THOUGH PROBABLY FEELING ALSO THAT HE HIMSELF COULD HARDLY AS YET BE ACCOUNTED AS DEEPLY GUILTY MISS ROBARTS SAID THE FATHER WE ARE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU
5463-39174-0016 BUT OUR CHILDREN ARE HARDLY USED TO SUCH THINGS
5463-39174-0017 OH CERTAINLY BOB MY CHILD
5463-39174-0018 AND THEN THE BAG IN A SOLEMN MANNER WAS CARRIED OVER TO THEIR MOTHER WHO TAKING IT FROM HER SON'S HANDS LAID IT HIGH ON A BOOKSHELF AND NOT ONE NOW SAID LUCY ROBARTS VERY PITEOUSLY DON'T BE SO HARD MISTER CRAWLEY NOT UPON THEM BUT UPON ME
5463-39174-0019 THIS WAS VERY DISCOURAGING TO LUCY IF ONE SMALL BAG OF GINGERBREAD NUTS CREATED SO GREAT A DIFFICULTY HOW WAS SHE TO DISPOSE OF THE POT OF GUAVA JELLY AND BOX OF BONBONS WHICH WERE STILL IN HER MUFF OR HOW DISTRIBUTE THE PACKET OF ORANGES WITH WHICH THE PONY CARRIAGE WAS LADEN
5463-39174-0020 AND THERE WAS JELLY FOR THE SICK CHILD AND CHICKEN BROTH WHICH WAS INDEED ANOTHER JELLY AND TO TELL THE TRUTH OPENLY THERE WAS ALSO A JOINT OF FRESH PORK AND A BASKET OF EGGS FROM THE FRAMLEY PARSONAGE FARMYARD WHICH MISSUS ROBARTS WAS TO INTRODUCE SHOULD SHE FIND HERSELF CAPABLE OF DOING SO
5463-39174-0021 BUT WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY BE CAST OUT WITH UTTER SCORN BY MISTER CRAWLEY IF TENDERED IN HIS IMMEDIATE PRESENCE THERE HAD ALSO BEEN A SUGGESTION AS TO ADDING TWO OR THREE BOTTLES OF PORT BUT THE COURAGE OF THE LADIES HAD FAILED THEM ON THAT HEAD AND THE WINE WAS NOT NOW ADDED TO THEIR DIFFICULTIES
5463-39174-0022 LUCY FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO KEEP UP A CONVERSATION WITH MISTER CRAWLEY THE MORE SO AS MISSUS ROBARTS AND MISSUS CRAWLEY PRESENTLY WITHDREW INTO A BEDROOM TAKING THE TWO YOUNGER CHILDREN WITH THEM HOW UNLUCKY THOUGHT LUCY THAT SHE HAS NOT GOT MY MUFF WITH HER
5463-39174-0023 BUT THE MUFF LAY IN HER LAP PONDEROUS WITH ITS RICH ENCLOSURES I SUPPOSE YOU WILL LIVE IN BARCHESTER FOR A PORTION OF THE YEAR NOW SAID MISTER CRAWLEY I REALLY DO NOT KNOW AS YET MARK TALKS OF TAKING LODGINGS FOR HIS FIRST MONTH'S RESIDENCE
5463-39174-0024 MARK THINKS THAT AS HE IS SO NEAR HE NEED NOT BE MUCH ABSENT FROM FRAMLEY EVEN DURING HIS RESIDENCE AND THEN LADY LUFTON IS SO GOOD ABOUT THE SCHOOLS AH YES BUT LADY LUFTON IS NOT A CLERGYMAN MISS ROBARTS
5463-39174-0025 IT WAS ON LUCY'S TONGUE TO SAY THAT HER LADYSHIP WAS PRETTY NEARLY AS BAD BUT SHE STOPPED HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT PROVIDENCE SENT GREAT RELIEF TO MISS ROBARTS IN THE SHAPE OF MISSUS CRAWLEY'S RED ARMED MAID OF ALL WORK WHO WALKING UP TO HER MASTER
5463-39174-0026 WHISPERED INTO HIS EAR THAT HE WAS WANTED IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY AT WHICH HIS ATTENDANCE WAS ALWAYS REQUIRED IN HIS PARISH SCHOOL AND THAT ATTENDANCE BEING SO PUNCTUALLY GIVEN THOSE WHO WANTED HIM LOOKED FOR HIM THERE AT THIS HOUR AND IF HE WERE ABSENT DID NOT SCRUPLE TO SEND FOR HIM
5463-39174-0027 MISS ROBARTS I AM AFRAID YOU MUST EXCUSE ME SAID HE GETTING UP AND TAKING HIS HAT AND STICK LUCY BEGGED THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BE AT ALL IN THE WAY AND ALREADY BEGAN TO SPECULATE HOW SHE MIGHT BEST UNLOAD HER TREASURES
5463-39174-0028 AND THEN STICK IN HAND HE WALKED FORTH AND LUCY FANCIED THAT BOBBY'S EYES IMMEDIATELY RESTED ON THE BAG OF GINGERBREAD NUTS BOB SAID SHE ALMOST IN A WHISPER
5463-39174-0029 I HAVE LEFT A BOOK BEHIND ME HE SAID AND COMING BACK THROUGH THE ROOM HE TOOK UP THE WELL WORN PRAYER BOOK WHICH ACCOMPANIED HIM IN ALL HIS WANDERINGS THROUGH THE PARISH BOBBY WHEN HE SAW HIS FATHER HAD RETREATED A FEW STEPS BACK AS ALSO DID GRACE WHO TO CONFESS THE TRUTH
5463-39174-0030 HAD BEEN ATTRACTED BY THE SOUND OF SUGAR PLUMS IN SPITE OF THE IRREGULAR VERBS AND LUCY WITHDREW HER HAND FROM HER MUFF AND LOOKED GUILTY WAS SHE NOT DECEIVING THE GOOD MAN NAY TEACHING HIS OWN CHILDREN TO DECEIVE HIM
5463-39174-0031 BUT THERE ARE MEN MADE OF SUCH STUFF THAT AN ANGEL COULD HARDLY LIVE WITH THEM WITHOUT SOME DECEIT PAPA'S GONE NOW WHISPERED BOBBY I SAW HIM TURN ROUND THE CORNER HE AT ANY RATE HAD LEARNED HIS LESSON AS IT WAS NATURAL THAT HE SHOULD DO
5463-39174-0032 SOME ONE ELSE ALSO HAD LEARNED THAT PAPA WAS GONE FOR WHILE BOB AND GRACE WERE STILL COUNTING THE BIG LUMPS OF SUGAR CANDY EACH EMPLOYED THE WHILE FOR INWARD SOLACE WITH AN INCH OF BARLEY SUGAR THE FRONT DOOR OPENED AND A BIG BASKET AND A BUNDLE DONE UP IN A KITCHEN CLOTH
5463-39174-0033 I DID VENTURE TO BRING THEM SAID FANNY WITH A LOOK OF SHAME FOR I KNOW HOW A SICK CHILD OCCUPIES THE WHOLE HOUSE AH MY FRIEND SAID MISSUS CRAWLEY TAKING HOLD OF MISSUS ROBARTS ARM AND LOOKING INTO HER FACE THAT SORT OF SHAME IS OVER WITH ME
5463-39174-0034 GOD HAS TRIED US WITH WANT AND FOR MY CHILDREN'S SAKE I AM GLAD OF SUCH RELIEF BUT WILL HE BE ANGRY I WILL MANAGE IT DEAR MISSUS ROBARTS YOU MUST NOT BE SURPRISED AT HIM HIS LOT IS SOMETIMES VERY HARD TO BEAR
5463-39174-0035 SUCH THINGS ARE SO MUCH WORSE FOR A MAN THAN FOR A WOMAN FANNY WAS NOT QUITE PREPARED TO ADMIT THIS IN HER OWN HEART BUT SHE MADE NO REPLY ON THAT HEAD I AM SURE I HOPE WE MAY BE ABLE TO BE OF USE TO YOU SHE SAID IF YOU WILL ONLY LOOK UPON ME AS AN OLD FRIEND AND WRITE TO ME IF YOU WANT ME
5463-39174-0036 TO FEEL HERSELF SO DIFFERENT FROM THE WIVES OF OTHER CLERGYMEN AROUND HER TO KNOW THAT THEY LIVED SOFTLY WHILE SHE WITH ALL THE WORK OF HER HANDS AND UNCEASING STRUGGLE OF HER ENERGIES COULD HARDLY MANAGE TO PLACE WHOLESOME FOOD BEFORE HER HUSBAND AND CHILDREN IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING A GRIEVOUS THING TO THINK OF
5463-39174-0037 THAT ALL THE WORK OF HER MIND SHOULD BE GIVEN UP TO SUCH SUBJECTS AS THESE BUT NEVERTHELESS SHE COULD BEAR IT SHE SAID AS LONG AS HE WOULD CARRY HIMSELF LIKE A MAN AND FACE HIS LOT BOLDLY BEFORE THE WORLD AND THEN SHE TOLD HOW HE HAD BEEN BETTER THERE AT HOGGLESTOCK THAN IN THEIR FORMER RESIDENCE DOWN IN CORNWALL
5463-39174-0038 MISSUS ARABIN TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS SO ANXIOUS YOU SHOULD GO TO THEM SAID MISSUS ROBARTS AH YES BUT THAT I FEAR IS IMPOSSIBLE THE CHILDREN YOU KNOW MISSUS ROBARTS
5463-39174-0039 OH NO I COULD NOT PUNISH YOU FOR YOUR GOODNESS IN THAT WAY BUT HE WOULD NOT GO HE COULD GO AND LEAVE ME AT HOME SOMETIMES I HAVE THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE SO AND I HAVE DONE ALL IN MY POWER TO PERSUADE HIM I HAVE TOLD HIM THAT IF HE COULD MIX ONCE MORE WITH THE WORLD WITH THE CLERICAL WORLD YOU KNOW
5463-39174-0040 THAT HE WOULD BE BETTER FITTED FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS OWN DUTIES BUT HE ANSWERS ME ANGRILY THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT HIS COAT IS NOT FIT FOR THE DEAN'S TABLE AND MISSUS CRAWLEY ALMOST BLUSHED AS SHE SPOKE OF SUCH A REASON WHAT WITH AN OLD FRIEND LIKE DOCTOR ARABIN
5463-39174-0041 BUT WHAT CAN I DO I FEAR THAT HE REGARDS THE RICH AS HIS ENEMIES HE IS PINING FOR THE SOLACE OF SOME FRIEND TO WHOM HE COULD TALK FOR SOME EQUAL WITH A MIND EDUCATED LIKE HIS OWN TO WHOSE THOUGHTS HE COULD LISTEN AND TO WHOM HE COULD SPEAK HIS OWN THOUGHTS
5463-39174-0042 BUT SUCH A FRIEND MUST BE EQUAL NOT ONLY IN MIND BUT IN PURSE AND WHERE CAN HE EVER FIND SUCH A MAN AS THAT BUT YOU MAY GET BETTER PREFERMENT AH NO AND IF HE DID WE ARE HARDLY FIT FOR IT NOW IF I COULD THINK THAT I COULD EDUCATE MY CHILDREN
5463-39174-0043 IF I COULD ONLY DO SOMETHING FOR MY POOR GRACE IN ANSWER TO THIS MISSUS ROBARTS SAID A WORD OR TWO BUT NOT MUCH SHE RESOLVED HOWEVER THAT IF SHE COULD GET HER HUSBAND'S LEAVE SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE FOR GRACE
5463-39174-0044 AND WAS IT NOT INCUMBENT ON HER TO MAKE SOME KINDLY USE OF ALL THE GOODS WITH WHICH PROVIDENCE HAD BLESSED HERSELF AND THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THE SITTING ROOM EACH AGAIN WITH A YOUNG CHILD IN HER ARMS
5463-39174-0045 LUCY HAD BEEN ENGAGED THE WHILE WITH THE CHILDREN AND WHEN THE TWO MARRIED LADIES ENTERED THEY FOUND THAT A SHOP HAD BEEN OPENED AT WHICH ALL MANNER OF LUXURIES WERE BEING READILY SOLD AND PURCHASED AT MARVELLOUSLY EASY PRICES THE GUAVA JELLY WAS THERE AND THE ORANGES AND THE SUGAR PLUMS RED AND YELLOW AND STRIPED
5463-39174-0046 AND MOREOVER THE GINGERBREAD HAD BEEN TAKEN DOWN IN THE AUDACITY OF THEIR COMMERCIAL SPECULATIONS AND THE NUTS WERE SPREAD OUT UPON A BOARD BEHIND WHICH LUCY STOOD AS SHOP GIRL DISPOSING OF THEM FOR KISSES MAMMA MAMMA SAID BOBBY RUNNING UP TO HIS MOTHER YOU MUST BUY SOMETHING OF HER
5463-39174-0047 AND HE POINTED WITH HIS FINGERS AT THE SHOP GIRL YOU MUST GIVE HER TWO KISSES FOR THAT HEAP OF BARLEY SUGAR LOOKING AT BOBBY'S MOUTH AT THE TIME ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT HIS KISSES MIGHT BE DISPENSED WITH WHEN THEY WERE AGAIN IN THE PONY CARRIAGE BEHIND THE IMPATIENT PUCK AND WERE WELL AWAY FROM THE DOOR
5463-39174-0048 FANNY WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK HOW VERY DIFFERENT THOSE TWO ARE SHE SAID DIFFERENT IN THEIR MINDS AND IN THEIR SPIRIT BUT HOW MUCH HIGHER TONED IS HER MIND THAN HIS HOW WEAK HE IS IN MANY THINGS AND HOW STRONG SHE IS IN EVERYTHING
5463-39174-0049 HOW FALSE IS HIS PRIDE AND HOW FALSE HIS SHAME BUT WE MUST REMEMBER WHAT HE HAS TO BEAR IT IS NOT EVERY ONE THAT CAN ENDURE SUCH A LIFE AS HIS WITHOUT FALSE PRIDE AND FALSE SHAME BUT SHE HAS NEITHER SAID LUCY
5463-39174-0050 BECAUSE YOU HAVE ONE HERO IN A FAMILY DOES THAT GIVE YOU A RIGHT TO EXPECT ANOTHER SAID MISSUS ROBARTS OF ALL MY OWN ACQUAINTANCE MISSUS CRAWLEY I THINK COMES NEAREST TO HEROISM AND THEN THEY PASSED BY THE HOGGLESTOCK SCHOOL AND MISTER CRAWLEY WHEN HE HEARD THE NOISE OF THE WHEELS CAME OUT
5514-19192-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE DISORDER A PARTISAN OF ORDER
5514-19192-0001 HE DID NOT ANSWER MY QUESTION HE IS A MAN WHO DOES GOOD BY GUN SHOTS SAID COMBEFERRE THOSE WHO HAVE PRESERVED SOME MEMORY OF THIS ALREADY DISTANT EPOCH KNOW THAT THE NATIONAL GUARD FROM THE SUBURBS WAS VALIANT AGAINST INSURRECTIONS
5514-19192-0002 IT WAS PARTICULARLY ZEALOUS AND INTREPID IN THE DAYS OF JUNE EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO
5514-19192-0003 WHOSE ESTABLISHMENT HAD BEEN CLOSED BY THE RIOTS BECAME LEONINE AT THE SIGHT OF HIS DESERTED DANCE HALL AND GOT HIMSELF KILLED TO PRESERVE THE ORDER REPRESENTED BY A TEA GARDEN IN THAT BOURGEOIS AND HEROIC TIME
5514-19192-0004 IN THE PRESENCE OF IDEAS WHICH HAD THEIR KNIGHTS INTERESTS HAD THEIR PALADINS THE PROSINESS OF THE ORIGINATORS DETRACTED NOTHING FROM THE BRAVERY OF THE MOVEMENT THE DIMINUTION OF A PILE OF CROWNS MADE BANKERS SING THE MARSEILLAISE
5514-19192-0005 THEY SHED THEIR BLOOD LYRICALLY FOR THE COUNTING HOUSE AND THEY DEFENDED THE SHOP THAT IMMENSE DIMINUTIVE OF THE FATHERLAND WITH LACEDAEMONIAN ENTHUSIASM AT BOTTOM WE WILL OBSERVE THERE WAS NOTHING IN ALL THIS THAT WAS NOT EXTREMELY SERIOUS
5514-19192-0006 IT WAS SOCIAL ELEMENTS ENTERING INTO STRIFE WHILE AWAITING THE DAY WHEN THEY SHOULD ENTER INTO EQUILIBRIUM ANOTHER SIGN OF THE TIMES WAS THE ANARCHY MINGLED WITH GOVERNMENTALISM THE BARBAROUS NAME OF THE CORRECT PARTY
5514-19192-0007 THE DRUM SUDDENLY BEAT CAPRICIOUS CALLS AT THE COMMAND OF SUCH OR SUCH A COLONEL OF THE NATIONAL GUARD
5514-19192-0008 SUCH AND SUCH NATIONAL GUARDSMEN FOUGHT FOR AN IDEA AND ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT AT CRITICAL MOMENTS ON DAYS THEY TOOK COUNSEL LESS OF THEIR LEADERS THAN OF THEIR INSTINCTS
5514-19192-0009 SOME OF THE SWORD LIKE FANNICOT OTHERS OF THE PEN LIKE HENRI FONFREDE CIVILIZATION UNFORTUNATELY REPRESENTED AT THIS EPOCH RATHER BY AN AGGREGATION OF INTERESTS THAN BY A GROUP OF PRINCIPLES WAS OR THOUGHT ITSELF IN PERIL
5514-19192-0010 IT SET UP THE CRY OF ALARM EACH CONSTITUTING HIMSELF A CENTRE DEFENDED IT SUCCORED IT AND PROTECTED IT WITH HIS OWN HEAD AND THE FIRST COMER TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO SAVE SOCIETY ZEAL SOMETIMES PROCEEDED TO EXTERMINATION
5514-19192-0011 A PLATOON OF THE NATIONAL GUARD WOULD CONSTITUTE ITSELF ON ITS OWN AUTHORITY A PRIVATE COUNCIL OF WAR AND JUDGE AND EXECUTE A CAPTURED INSURGENT IN FIVE MINUTES IT WAS AN IMPROVISATION OF THIS SORT THAT HAD SLAIN JEAN PROUVAIRE FIERCE LYNCH LAW
5514-19192-0012 WITH WHICH NO ONE PARTY HAD ANY RIGHT TO REPROACH THE REST FOR IT HAS BEEN APPLIED BY THE REPUBLIC IN AMERICA AS WELL AS BY THE MONARCHY IN EUROPE THIS LYNCH LAW WAS COMPLICATED WITH MISTAKES ON ONE DAY OF RIOTING A YOUNG POET NAMED PAUL AIME GARNIER
5514-19192-0013 WAS PURSUED IN THE PLACE ROYALE WITH A BAYONET AT HIS LOINS
5514-19192-0014 THEY SHOUTED THERE'S ANOTHER OF THOSE SAINT SIMONIANS AND THEY WANTED TO KILL HIM NOW HE HAD UNDER HIS ARM A VOLUME OF THE MEMOIRS OF THE DUC DE SAINT SIMON
5514-19192-0015 AND HAD SHOUTED DEATH ON THE SIXTH OF JUNE EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO A COMPANY OF THE NATIONAL GUARDS FROM THE SUBURBS COMMANDED BY THE CAPTAIN FANNICOT ABOVE MENTIONED
5514-19192-0016 OUT OF CAPRICE AND ITS OWN GOOD PLEASURE THIS FACT SINGULAR THOUGH IT MAY SEEM WAS PROVED AT THE JUDICIAL INVESTIGATION OPENED IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE INSURRECTION OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO CAPTAIN FANNICOT A BOLD AND IMPATIENT BOURGEOIS
5514-19192-0017 A SORT OF CONDOTTIERE OF THE ORDER OF THOSE WHOM WE HAVE JUST CHARACTERIZED A FANATICAL AND INTRACTABLE GOVERNMENTALIST COULD NOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO FIRE PREMATURELY
5514-19192-0018 AND THE AMBITION OF CAPTURING THE BARRICADE ALONE AND UNAIDED THAT IS TO SAY WITH HIS COMPANY EXASPERATED BY THE SUCCESSIVE APPARITION OF THE RED FLAG AND THE OLD COAT WHICH HE TOOK FOR THE BLACK FLAG HE LOUDLY BLAMED THE GENERALS AND CHIEFS OF THE CORPS
5514-19192-0019 AND WHO WERE ALLOWING THE INSURRECTION TO FRY IN ITS OWN FAT TO USE THE CELEBRATED EXPRESSION OF ONE OF THEM FOR HIS PART HE THOUGHT THE BARRICADE RIPE AND AS THAT WHICH IS RIPE OUGHT TO FALL HE MADE THE ATTEMPT
5514-19192-0020 HE COMMANDED MEN AS RESOLUTE AS HIMSELF RAGING FELLOWS AS A WITNESS SAID HIS COMPANY THE SAME WHICH HAD SHOT JEAN PROUVAIRE THE POET WAS THE FIRST OF THE BATTALION POSTED AT THE ANGLE OF THE STREET
5514-19192-0021 THIS MOVEMENT EXECUTED WITH MORE GOOD WILL THAN STRATEGY COST THE FANNICOT COMPANY DEAR BEFORE IT HAD TRAVERSED TWO THIRDS OF THE STREET IT WAS RECEIVED BY A GENERAL DISCHARGE FROM THE BARRICADE FOUR THE MOST AUDACIOUS WHO WERE RUNNING ON IN FRONT
5514-19192-0022 WERE MOWN DOWN POINT BLANK AT THE VERY FOOT OF THE REDOUBT AND THIS COURAGEOUS THRONG OF NATIONAL GUARDS VERY BRAVE MEN BUT LACKING IN MILITARY TENACITY WERE FORCED TO FALL BACK AFTER SOME HESITATION LEAVING FIFTEEN CORPSES ON THE PAVEMENT
5514-19192-0023 THIS MOMENTARY HESITATION GAVE THE INSURGENTS TIME TO RE LOAD THEIR WEAPONS AND A SECOND AND VERY DESTRUCTIVE DISCHARGE STRUCK THE COMPANY BEFORE IT COULD REGAIN THE CORNER OF THE STREET ITS SHELTER A MOMENT MORE AND IT WAS CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO FIRES
5514-19192-0024 AND IT RECEIVED THE VOLLEY FROM THE BATTERY PIECE WHICH NOT HAVING RECEIVED THE ORDER HAD NOT DISCONTINUED ITS FIRING THE INTREPID AND IMPRUDENT FANNICOT WAS ONE OF THE DEAD FROM THIS GRAPE SHOT HE WAS KILLED BY THE CANNON THAT IS TO SAY BY ORDER
5514-19192-0025 THIS ATTACK WHICH WAS MORE FURIOUS THAN SERIOUS
5514-19192-0026 THEY ARE GETTING THEIR OWN MEN KILLED AND THEY ARE USING UP OUR AMMUNITION FOR NOTHING
5514-19192-0027 INSURRECTION AND REPRESSION DO NOT FIGHT WITH EQUAL WEAPONS INSURRECTION WHICH IS SPEEDILY EXHAUSTED HAS ONLY A CERTAIN NUMBER OF SHOTS TO FIRE AND A CERTAIN NUMBER OF COMBATANTS TO EXPEND AN EMPTY CARTRIDGE BOX A MAN KILLED CANNOT BE REPLACED
5514-19192-0028 AS REPRESSION HAS THE ARMY IT DOES NOT COUNT ITS MEN AND AS IT HAS VINCENNES IT DOES NOT COUNT ITS SHOTS REPRESSION HAS AS MANY REGIMENTS AS THE BARRICADE HAS MEN AND AS MANY ARSENALS AS THE BARRICADE HAS CARTRIDGE BOXES
5514-19192-0029 THUS THEY ARE STRUGGLES OF ONE AGAINST A HUNDRED WHICH ALWAYS END IN CRUSHING THE BARRICADE UNLESS THE REVOLUTION UPRISING SUDDENLY FLINGS INTO THE BALANCE ITS FLAMING ARCHANGEL'S SWORD THIS DOES HAPPEN SOMETIMES
5514-19192-0030 THEN EVERYTHING RISES THE PAVEMENTS BEGIN TO SEETHE POPULAR REDOUBTS ABOUND PARIS QUIVERS SUPREMELY THE QUID DIVINUM IS GIVEN FORTH A TENTH OF AUGUST IS IN THE AIR A TWENTY NINTH OF JULY IS IN THE AIR
5514-19192-0031 A WONDERFUL LIGHT APPEARS THE YAWNING MAW OF FORCE DRAWS BACK AND THE ARMY THAT LION SEES BEFORE IT ERECT AND TRANQUIL THAT PROPHET FRANCE CHAPTER THIRTEEN
5514-19192-0032 PASSING GLEAMS IN THE CHAOS OF SENTIMENTS AND PASSIONS WHICH DEFEND A BARRICADE THERE IS A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING THERE IS BRAVERY THERE IS YOUTH HONOR ENTHUSIASM THE IDEAL CONVICTION
5514-19192-0033 THE RAGE OF THE GAMBLER AND ABOVE ALL INTERMITTENCES OF HOPE ONE OF THESE INTERMITTENCES ONE OF THESE VAGUE QUIVERS OF HOPE SUDDENLY TRAVERSED THE BARRICADE OF THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT WAS LEAST EXPECTED LISTEN
5514-19192-0034 WHO WAS STILL ON THE WATCH IT SEEMS TO ME THAT PARIS IS WAKING UP IT IS CERTAIN THAT ON THE MORNING OF THE SIXTH OF JUNE THE INSURRECTION BROKE OUT AFRESH FOR AN HOUR OR TWO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT
5514-19192-0035 REANIMATED SOME FANCIES BARRICADES WERE BEGUN IN THE RUE DU POIRIER AND THE RUE DES GRAVILLIERS IN FRONT OF THE PORTE SAINT MARTIN A YOUNG MAN ARMED WITH A RIFLE ATTACKED ALONE A SQUADRON OF CAVALRY
5514-19192-0036 IN PLAIN SIGHT ON THE OPEN BOULEVARD HE PLACED ONE KNEE ON THE GROUND SHOULDERED HIS WEAPON FIRED KILLED THE COMMANDER OF THE SQUADRON AND TURNED AWAY SAYING THERE'S ANOTHER WHO WILL DO US NO MORE HARM HE WAS PUT TO THE SWORD
5514-19192-0037 THE SLATS OF THE BLIND COULD BE SEEN TO TREMBLE AT EVERY SHOT A CHILD FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE WAS ARRESTED IN THE RUE DE LA COSSONERIE WITH HIS POCKETS FULL OF CARTRIDGES MANY POSTS WERE ATTACKED AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE RUE BERTIN POIREE
5514-19192-0038 A VERY LIVELY AND UTTERLY UNEXPECTED FUSILLADE WELCOMED A REGIMENT OF CUIRRASSIERS AT WHOSE HEAD MARCHED MARSHAL GENERAL CAVAIGNAC DE BARAGUE IN THE RUE PLANCHE MIBRAY THEY THREW OLD PIECES OF POTTERY AND HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS
5514-19192-0039 DOWN ON THE SOLDIERS FROM THE ROOFS A BAD SIGN
5514-19192-0040 AS HE RECALLED SUCHET'S SAYING AT SARAGOSSA
5514-19192-0041 THESE GENERAL SYMPTOMS WHICH PRESENTED THEMSELVES AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE UPRISING HAD BEEN RENDERED LOCAL THIS FEVER OF WRATH THESE SPARKS WHICH FLEW HITHER AND THITHER ABOVE THOSE DEEP MASSES OF
5514-19192-0042 ALL THIS TAKEN TOGETHER DISTURBED THE MILITARY CHIEFS
5514-19192-0043 THEY DELAYED THE ATTACK ON THE BARRICADES MAUBUEE
5514-19192-0044 IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE BARRICADES ONLY AND BE ABLE TO FINISH THEM AT ONE BLOW COLUMNS WERE THROWN INTO THE STREETS WHERE THERE WAS FERMENTATION SWEEPING THE LARGE SOUNDING THE SMALL RIGHT AND LEFT NOW SLOWLY AND CAUTIOUSLY NOW AT FULL CHARGE
5514-19192-0045 THE TROOPS BROKE IN THE DOORS OF HOUSES WHENCE SHOTS HAD BEEN FIRED AT THE SAME TIME
5514-19192-0046 THIS REPRESSION WAS NOT EFFECTED WITHOUT SOME COMMOTION AND WITHOUT THAT TUMULTUOUS UPROAR PECULIAR TO COLLISIONS BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE PEOPLE
5514-19192-0047 MOREOVER HE HAD SEEN WOUNDED MEN PASSING THE END OF THE STREET IN LITTERS AND HE SAID TO COURFEYRAC
5514-19192-0048 THEIR HOPE DID NOT LAST LONG THE GLEAM WAS QUICKLY ECLIPSED IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR WHAT WAS IN THE AIR VANISHED IT WAS A FLASH OF LIGHTNING UNACCOMPANIED BY THUNDER AND THE INSURGENTS FELT THAT SORT OF LEADEN COPE
5514-19192-0049 WHICH THE INDIFFERENCE OF THE PEOPLE CASTS OVER OBSTINATE AND DESERTED MEN FALL OVER THEM ONCE MORE THE GENERAL MOVEMENT WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE ASSUMED A VAGUE OUTLINE HAD MISCARRIED AND THE ATTENTION OF THE MINISTER OF WAR AND THE STRATEGY OF THE GENERALS
5514-19192-0050 COULD NOW BE CONCENTRATED ON THE THREE OR FOUR BARRICADES WHICH STILL REMAINED STANDING THE SUN WAS MOUNTING ABOVE THE HORIZON
5514-19193-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN WHEREIN WILL APPEAR THE NAME OF ENJOLRAS MISTRESS
5514-19193-0001 CONTINUED TO INSULT THE CANNON AND EACH TIME THAT THAT GLOOMY CLOUD OF PROJECTILES WHICH IS CALLED GRAPE SHOT PASSED OVERHEAD WITH ITS TERRIBLE SOUND HE ASSAILED IT WITH A BURST OF IRONY YOU ARE WEARING OUT YOUR LUNGS POOR BRUTAL OLD FELLOW
5514-19193-0002 YOU PAIN ME YOU ARE WASTING YOUR ROW THAT'S NOT THUNDER IT'S A COUGH AND THE BYSTANDERS LAUGHED
5514-19193-0003 WHO MAKE US CRAZY THAT IS TO SAY BRAVE WHEN A MAN IS AS MUCH IN LOVE AS A TIGER
5514-19193-0004 THAT IS ONE WAY OF TAKING OUR REVENGE FOR THE CAPERS THAT MESDAMES OUR GRISETTES PLAY ON US ROLAND GETS HIMSELF KILLED FOR ANGELIQUE ALL OUR HEROISM COMES FROM OUR WOMEN A MAN WITHOUT A WOMAN IS A PISTOL WITHOUT A TRIGGER IT IS THE WOMAN THAT SETS THE MAN OFF
5514-19193-0005 HE IS NOT IN LOVE AND YET HE MANAGES TO BE INTREPID IT IS A THING UNHEARD OF THAT A MAN SHOULD BE AS COLD AS ICE AND AS BOLD AS FIRE
5514-19193-0006 HAD ANY ONE BEEN NEAR HIM THAT PERSON WOULD HAVE HEARD HIM MUTTER IN A LOW VOICE PATRIA
5514-19193-0007 AND ASSUMING THE TONE OF AN USHER MAKING AN ANNOUNCEMENT HE ADDED MY NAME IS EIGHT POUNDER IN FACT A NEW PERSONAGE HAD ENTERED ON THE SCENE THIS WAS A SECOND PIECE OF ORDNANCE
5514-19193-0008 AND PLACED THIS SECOND PIECE IN LINE WITH THE FIRST THIS OUTLINED THE CATASTROPHE A FEW MINUTES LATER THE TWO PIECES RAPIDLY SERVED WERE FIRING POINT BLANK AT THE REDOUBT
5514-19193-0009 THE PLATOON FIRING OF THE LINE AND OF THE SOLDIERS FROM THE SUBURBS SUSTAINED THE ARTILLERY ANOTHER CANNONADE WAS AUDIBLE AT SOME DISTANCE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE TWO GUNS WERE FURIOUSLY ATTACKING THE REDOUBT FROM THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE
5514-19193-0010 THE FOUR CANNONS ECHOED EACH OTHER MOURNFULLY THE BARKING OF THESE SOMBRE DOGS OF WAR REPLIED TO EACH OTHER
5514-19193-0011 THE OTHER BALLS THE PIECE WHICH WAS FIRING BALLS WAS POINTED A LITTLE HIGH AND THE AIM WAS CALCULATED SO THAT THE BALL STRUCK THE EXTREME EDGE OF THE UPPER CREST OF THE BARRICADE AND CRUMBLED THE STONE DOWN UPON THE INSURGENTS MINGLED WITH BURSTS OF GRAPE SHOT
5514-19193-0012 THE OBJECT OF THIS MODE OF FIRING WAS TO DRIVE THE INSURGENTS FROM THE SUMMIT OF THE REDOUBT AND TO COMPEL THEM TO GATHER CLOSE IN THE INTERIOR THAT IS TO SAY THIS ANNOUNCED THE ASSAULT THE COMBATANTS ONCE DRIVEN FROM THE CREST OF THE BARRICADE BY BALLS AND
5514-19193-0013 FROM THE WINDOWS OF THE CABARET BY GRAPE SHOT THE ATTACKING COLUMNS COULD VENTURE INTO THE STREET WITHOUT BEING PICKED OFF PERHAPS EVEN WITHOUT BEING SEEN COULD BRISKLY AND SUDDENLY SCALE THE REDOUBT
5514-19193-0014 AND HE SHOUTED FIRE ON THE ARTILLERY MEN ALL WERE READY THE BARRICADE WHICH HAD LONG BEEN SILENT POURED FORTH A DESPERATE FIRE SEVEN OR EIGHT DISCHARGES FOLLOWED WITH A SORT OF RAGE AND JOY
5514-19193-0015 THE STREET WAS FILLED WITH BLINDING SMOKE AND AT THE END OF A FEW MINUTES ATHWART THIS MIST ALL STREAKED WITH FLAME TWO THIRDS OF THE GUNNERS COULD BE DISTINGUISHED LYING BENEATH THE WHEELS OF THE CANNONS
5514-19193-0016 THOSE WHO WERE LEFT STANDING CONTINUED TO SERVE THE PIECES WITH SEVERE TRANQUILLITY BUT THE FIRE HAD SLACKENED THINGS ARE GOING WELL NOW SAID BOSSUET TO ENJOLRAS SUCCESS
5514-19193-0017 ANOTHER QUARTER OF AN HOUR OF THIS SUCCESS AND THERE WILL NOT BE ANY CARTRIDGES LEFT IN THE BARRICADE IT APPEARS THAT GAVROCHE OVERHEARD THIS REMARK CHAPTER FIFTEEN GAVROCHE OUTSIDE
5514-19193-0018 COURFEYRAC SUDDENLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF SOME ONE AT THE BASE OF THE BARRICADE OUTSIDE IN THE STREET AMID THE BULLETS GAVROCHE HAD TAKEN A BOTTLE BASKET FROM THE WINE SHOP HAD MADE HIS WAY OUT THROUGH THE CUT AND WAS QUIETLY ENGAGED IN EMPTYING
5514-19193-0019 THE FULL CARTRIDGE BOXES OF THE NATIONAL GUARDSMEN WHO HAD BEEN KILLED ON THE SLOPE OF THE REDOUBT INTO HIS BASKET WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE ASKED COURFEYRAC GAVROCHE RAISED HIS FACE I'M FILLING MY BASKET CITIZEN DON'T YOU SEE THE GRAPE SHOT
5514-19193-0020 GAVROCHE REPLIED WELL IT IS RAINING WHAT THEN COURFEYRAC SHOUTED COME IN INSTANTER SAID GAVROCHE AND WITH A SINGLE BOUND HE PLUNGED INTO THE STREET
5514-19193-0021 IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT FANNICOT'S COMPANY HAD LEFT BEHIND IT A TRAIL OF BODIES TWENTY CORPSES LAY SCATTERED HERE AND THERE ON THE PAVEMENT THROUGH THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE STREET TWENTY CARTOUCHES FOR GAVROCHE MEANT A PROVISION OF CARTRIDGES FOR THE BARRICADE
5514-19193-0022 THE SMOKE IN THE STREET WAS LIKE A FOG WHOEVER HAS BEHELD A CLOUD WHICH HAS FALLEN INTO A MOUNTAIN GORGE BETWEEN TWO PEAKED ESCARPMENTS CAN IMAGINE THIS SMOKE RENDERED DENSER AND THICKER BY TWO GLOOMY ROWS OF LOFTY HOUSES
5514-19193-0023 IT ROSE GRADUALLY AND WAS INCESSANTLY RENEWED HENCE A TWILIGHT WHICH MADE EVEN THE BROAD DAYLIGHT TURN PALE THE COMBATANTS COULD HARDLY SEE EACH OTHER FROM ONE END OF THE STREET TO THE OTHER SHORT AS IT WAS
5514-19193-0024 THIS OBSCURITY WHICH HAD PROBABLY BEEN DESIRED AND CALCULATED ON BY THE COMMANDERS WHO WERE TO DIRECT THE ASSAULT ON THE BARRICADE WAS USEFUL TO GAVROCHE BENEATH THE FOLDS OF THIS VEIL OF SMOKE AND THANKS TO HIS SMALL SIZE
5514-19193-0025 HE RIFLED THE FIRST SEVEN OR EIGHT CARTRIDGE BOXES WITHOUT MUCH DANGER HE CRAWLED FLAT ON HIS BELLY GALLOPED ON ALL FOURS TOOK HIS BASKET IN HIS TEETH TWISTED GLIDED UNDULATED WOUND FROM ONE DEAD BODY TO ANOTHER
5514-19193-0026 AND EMPTIED THE CARTRIDGE BOX OR CARTOUCHE AS A MONKEY OPENS A NUT THEY DID NOT DARE TO SHOUT TO HIM TO RETURN FROM THE BARRICADE WHICH WAS QUITE NEAR FOR FEAR OF ATTRACTING ATTENTION TO HIM ON ONE BODY THAT OF A CORPORAL HE FOUND A POWDER FLASK
5514-19193-0027 FOR THIRST SAID HE PUTTING IT IN HIS POCKET BY DINT OF ADVANCING HE REACHED A POINT WHERE THE FOG OF THE FUSILLADE BECAME TRANSPARENT SO THAT THE SHARPSHOOTERS OF THE LINE RANGED ON THE OUTLOOK BEHIND THEIR PAVING STONE DIKE
5514-19193-0028 AND THE SHARPSHOOTERS OF THE BANLIEUE MASSED AT THE CORNER OF THE STREET SUDDENLY POINTED OUT TO EACH OTHER SOMETHING MOVING THROUGH THE SMOKE AT THE MOMENT WHEN GAVROCHE WAS RELIEVING A SERGEANT WHO WAS LYING NEAR A STONE DOOR POST OF HIS CARTRIDGES A BULLET STRUCK THE BODY
5514-19193-0029 FICHTRE EJACULATED GAVROCHE THEY ARE KILLING MY DEAD MEN FOR ME A SECOND BULLET STRUCK A SPARK FROM THE PAVEMENT BESIDE HIM A THIRD OVERTURNED HIS BASKET
5514-19193-0030 IT WAS A CHARMING AND TERRIBLE SIGHT GAVROCHE THOUGH SHOT AT WAS TEASING THE FUSILLADE HE HAD THE AIR OF BEING GREATLY DIVERTED IT WAS THE SPARROW PECKING AT THE SPORTSMEN TO EACH DISCHARGE HE RETORTED WITH A COUPLET
5514-19193-0031 THEY AIMED AT HIM CONSTANTLY AND ALWAYS MISSED HIM THE NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND THE SOLDIERS LAUGHED AS THEY TOOK AIM AT HIM HE LAY DOWN SPRANG TO HIS FEET HID IN THE CORNER OF A DOORWAY THEN MADE A BOUND DISAPPEARED RE APPEARED SCAMPERED AWAY RETURNED
5514-19193-0032 REPLIED TO THE GRAPE SHOT WITH HIS THUMB AT HIS NOSE AND ALL THE WHILE WENT ON PILLAGING THE CARTOUCHES EMPTYING THE CARTRIDGE BOXES AND FILLING HIS BASKET THE INSURGENTS PANTING WITH ANXIETY FOLLOWED HIM WITH THEIR EYES THE BARRICADE TREMBLED HE SANG
5514-19193-0033 HE WAS NOT A CHILD HE WAS NOT A MAN HE WAS A STRANGE GAMIN FAIRY HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CALLED THE INVULNERABLE DWARF OF THE FRAY THE BULLETS FLEW AFTER HIM HE WAS MORE NIMBLE THAN THEY HE PLAYED A FEARFUL GAME OF HIDE AND SEEK WITH DEATH
5514-19193-0034 EVERY TIME THAT THE FLAT NOSED FACE OF THE SPECTRE APPROACHED THE URCHIN ADMINISTERED TO IT A FILLIP ONE BULLET HOWEVER BETTER AIMED OR MORE TREACHEROUS THAN THE REST FINALLY STRUCK THE WILL O' THE WISP OF A CHILD
5514-19193-0035 GAVROCHE WAS SEEN TO STAGGER THEN HE SANK TO THE EARTH THE WHOLE BARRICADE GAVE VENT TO A CRY BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING OF ANTAEUS IN THAT PYGMY FOR THE GAMIN TO TOUCH THE PAVEMENT IS THE SAME AS FOR THE GIANT TO TOUCH THE EARTH GAVROCHE HAD FALLEN ONLY TO RISE AGAIN
5561-39621-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN PARRY
5561-39621-0001 AND LENDING AN EAR TO THE VARIOUS NOISES
5561-39621-0002 THE STRANGER DID NOT PAY THEM THE LEAST ATTENTION
5561-39621-0003 WHISPERED MONSIEUR THE DIAMOND HAS BEEN VALUED AH SAID THE TRAVELER WELL WELL MONSIEUR THE JEWELER OF S A R GIVES TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY PISTOLES FOR IT HAVE YOU THEM I THOUGHT IT BEST TO TAKE THEM MONSIEUR

5561-39621-0006 AFTER HAVING TAKEN FROM IT THE AMOUNT OF HIS RECKONING
5561-39621-0007 DINNER HAS ALREADY BEEN REFUSED
5561-39621-0008 THE UNKNOWN ASKED FOR A GLASS OF WINE BROKE OFF A MORSEL OF BREAD AND DID NOT STIR FROM THE WINDOW WHILST HE ATE AND DRANK
5561-39621-0009 CRIES AROSE IN THE DISTANCE A CONFUSED BUZZING FILLED THE LOWER PART OF THE CITY AND THE FIRST DISTINCT SOUND THAT STRUCK THE EARS OF THE STRANGER WAS THE TRAMP OF ADVANCING HORSES
5561-39621-0010 WITH CROPOLE WERE MINGLED AND JOSTLED ON THE STAIRCASE
5561-39621-0011 THE CORTEGE ADVANCED SLOWLY LIGHTED BY A THOUSAND FLAMBEAUX IN THE STREETS AND FROM THE WINDOWS
5561-39621-0012 DRAWN LIKE A CARRIAGE BY FOUR BLACK HORSES
5561-39621-0013 HER GENTLEMEN ON HORSEBACK AT BOTH SIDES THE KING THEN APPEARED MOUNTED UPON A SPLENDID HORSE OF SAXON BREED WITH A FLOWING MANE
5561-39621-0014 THE YOUNG PRINCE EXHIBITED WHEN BOWING TO SOME WINDOWS FROM WHICH ISSUED THE MOST ANIMATED ACCLAMATIONS A NOBLE AND HANDSOME COUNTENANCE ILLUMINATED BY THE FLAMBEAUX OF HIS PAGES BY THE SIDE OF THE KING THOUGH A LITTLE IN THE REAR
5561-39621-0015 AND TWENTY OTHER COURTIERS FOLLOWED BY THEIR PEOPLE AND THEIR BAGGAGE CLOSED THIS VERITABLY TRIUMPHANT MARCH THE POMP WAS OF A MILITARY CHARACTER
5561-39621-0016 WORE TRAVELING DRESSES BUT ALL THE REST WERE CLOTHED IN WARLIKE PANOPLY
5561-39621-0017 WHEN THE KING PASSED BEFORE HIM THE UNKNOWN WHO HAD LEANT FORWARD OVER THE BALCONY TO OBTAIN A BETTER VIEW AND WHO HAD CONCEALED HIS FACE BY LEANING ON HIS ARM FELT HIS HEART SWELL AND OVERFLOW WITH A BITTER JEALOUSY THE NOISE OF THE TRUMPETS EXCITED HIM
5561-39621-0018 THE POPULAR ACCLAMATIONS DEAFENED HIM FOR A MOMENT HE ALLOWED HIS REASON TO BE ABSORBED IN THIS FLOOD OF LIGHTS TUMULT AND BRILLIANT IMAGES HE IS A KING MURMURED HE IN AN ACCENT OF DESPAIR THEN BEFORE HE HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS SOMBRE REVERIE
5561-39621-0019 ALL THE NOISE ALL THE SPLENDOR HAD PASSED AWAY AT THE ANGLE OF THE STREET THERE REMAINED NOTHING BENEATH THE STRANGER BUT A FEW HOARSE DISCORDANT VOICES SHOUTING AT INTERVALS VIVE LE ROI
5561-39621-0020 HOW GOOD LOOKING THE KING IS HOW STRONGLY HE RESEMBLES HIS ILLUSTRIOUS FATHER A HANDSOME LIKENESS SAID PITTRINO
5561-39621-0021 CROPOLE WAS FEEDING THEIR GOSSIP WITH HIS OWN PERSONAL REMARKS WITHOUT OBSERVING THAT AN OLD MAN ON FOOT BUT LEADING A SMALL IRISH HORSE BY THE BRIDLE WAS ENDEAVORING TO PENETRATE THE CROWD OF MEN AND WOMEN WHICH BLOCKED UP THE ENTRANCE TO THE MEDICI BUT AT THAT MOMENT THE VOICE OF THE STRANGER WAS HEARD FROM THE WINDOW
5561-39621-0022 MAKE WAY MONSIEUR L'HOTELIER TO THE ENTRANCE OF YOUR HOUSE
5561-39621-0023 THE WINDOW WAS INSTANTLY CLOSED PITTRINO POINTED OUT THE WAY TO THE NEWLY ARRIVED GUEST WHO ENTERED WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD THE STRANGER WAITED FOR HIM ON THE LANDING HE OPENED HIS ARMS TO THE OLD MAN AND LED HIM TO A SEAT
