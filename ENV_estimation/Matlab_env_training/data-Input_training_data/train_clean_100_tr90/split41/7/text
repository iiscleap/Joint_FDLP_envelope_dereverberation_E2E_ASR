200-126784-0001 IN ESKE OR LIDDEL FORDS WERE NONE BUT HE WOULD RIDE THEM ONE BY ONE ALIKE TO HIM WAS TIME OR TIDE DECEMBER'S SNOW OR JULY'S PRIDE ALIKE TO HIM WAS TIDE OR TIME MOONLESS MIDNIGHT OR MATIN PRIME
200-126784-0002 WALTER SCOTT ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE WHARTON FAMILY LAID THEIR HEADS ON THEIR PILLOWS THAT NIGHT WITH A FOREBODING OF SOME INTERRUPTION TO THEIR ORDINARY QUIET UNEASINESS KEPT THE SISTERS FROM ENJOYING THEIR USUAL REPOSE
200-126784-0003 AND THEY ROSE FROM THEIR BEDS ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING UNREFRESHED AND ALMOST WITHOUT HAVING CLOSED THEIR EYES ON TAKING AN EAGER AND HASTY SURVEY OF THE VALLEY FROM THE WINDOWS OF THEIR ROOM NOTHING HOWEVER BUT ITS USUAL SERENITY WAS TO BE SEEN
200-126784-0004 COMPOSE THE SEASON FOR ENJOYMENT IN THE OPEN AIR THEY HAVE THEIR STORMS BUT THEY ARE DISTINCT AND NOT OF LONG CONTINUANCE LEAVING A CLEAR ATMOSPHERE AND A CLOUDLESS SKY
200-126784-0005 THE SISTERS DESCENDED TO THE PARLOR WITH A RETURNING CONFIDENCE IN THEIR BROTHER'S SECURITY AND THEIR OWN HAPPINESS THE FAMILY WERE EARLY IN ASSEMBLING AROUND THE BREAKFAST TABLE AND MISS PEYTON WITH A LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE
200-126784-0006 HAD PLEASANTLY INSISTED THAT THE ABSENCE OF HER NEPHEW SHOULD IN NO MANNER INTERFERE WITH THE REGULAR HOURS SHE HAD ESTABLISHED CONSEQUENTLY THE PARTY WERE ALREADY SEATED WHEN THE CAPTAIN MADE HIS APPEARANCE
200-126784-0007 THOUGH THE UNTASTED COFFEE SUFFICIENTLY PROVED THAT BY NONE OF HIS RELATIVES WAS HIS ABSENCE DISREGARDED I THINK I DID MUCH BETTER HE CRIED TAKING A CHAIR BETWEEN HIS SISTERS AND RECEIVING THEIR OFFERED SALUTES
200-126784-0008 TURNING TO HIS YOUNGER AND EVIDENTLY FAVORITE SISTER AND TAPPING HER CHEEK DID YOU SEE BANNERS IN THE CLOUDS AND MISTAKE MISS PEYTON'S AEOLIAN HARP FOR REBELLIOUS MUSIC NAY HENRY REJOINED THE MAID
200-126784-0009 LOOKING AT HIM AFFECTIONATELY MUCH AS I LOVE MY OWN COUNTRY THE APPROACH OF HER TROOPS JUST NOW WOULD GIVE ME GREAT PAIN THE BROTHER MADE NO REPLY BUT RETURNING THE FONDNESS EXPRESSED IN HER EYE BY A LOOK OF FRATERNAL TENDERNESS
200-126784-0010 HE GENTLY PRESSED HER HAND IN SILENCE WHEN CAESAR WHO HAD PARTICIPATED LARGELY IN THE ANXIETY OF THE FAMILY AND WHO HAD RISEN WITH THE DAWN AND KEPT A VIGILANT WATCH ON THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS AS HE STOOD GAZING FROM ONE OF THE WINDOWS
200-126784-0011 RUN MASSA HARRY RUN
200-126784-0012 RUN REPEATED THE BRITISH OFFICER GATHERING HIMSELF UP IN MILITARY PRIDE NO MISTER CAESAR RUNNING IS NOT MY TRADE WHILE SPEAKING HE WALKED DELIBERATELY TO THE WINDOW
200-126784-0013 WHERE THE FAMILY WERE ALREADY COLLECTED IN THE GREATEST CONSTERNATION
200-126784-0014 HIS HOUSE WAS SURROUNDED BY A DOZEN SENTINELS TWO OR THREE OF THE DRAGOONS NOW DISMOUNTED AND DISAPPEARED IN A FEW MINUTES HOWEVER THEY RETURNED TO THE YARD FOLLOWED BY KATY FROM WHOSE
200-126784-0015 VIOLENT GESTICULATIONS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MATTERS OF NO TRIFLING CONCERN WERE ON THE CARPET A SHORT COMMUNICATION WITH THE LOQUACIOUS HOUSEKEEPER FOLLOWED THE ARRIVAL OF THE MAIN BODY OF THE TROOP AND THE ADVANCE PARTY REMOUNTING
200-126784-0016 BUT THEY WERE ALL HAUGHTILY REJECTED BY THE YOUNG MAN AS UNWORTHY OF HIS CHARACTER IT WAS TOO LATE TO RETREAT TO THE WOODS IN THE REAR OF THE COTTAGE FOR HE WOULD UNAVOIDABLY BE SEEN AND FOLLOWED BY A TROOP OF HORSE AS INEVITABLY TAKEN
200-126784-0017 AT LENGTH HIS SISTERS WITH TREMBLING HANDS REPLACED HIS ORIGINAL DISGUISE THE INSTRUMENTS OF WHICH HAD BEEN CAREFULLY KEPT AT HAND BY CAESAR IN EXPECTATION OF SOME SUDDEN EMERGENCY
200-126784-0018 THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS HASTILY AND IMPERFECTLY COMPLETED AS THE DRAGOONS ENTERED THE LAWN AND ORCHARD OF THE LOCUSTS RIDING WITH THE RAPIDITY OF THE WIND AND IN THEIR TURN THE WHARTONS WERE SURROUNDED
200-126784-0019 NOTHING REMAINED NOW BUT TO MEET THE IMPENDING EXAMINATION WITH AS MUCH INDIFFERENCE AS THE FAMILY COULD ASSUME THE LEADER OF THE HORSE DISMOUNTED AND FOLLOWED BY A COUPLE OF HIS MEN HE APPROACHED THE OUTER DOOR OF THE BUILDING
200-126784-0020 WHICH WAS SLOWLY AND RELUCTANTLY OPENED FOR HIS ADMISSION BY CAESAR THE HEAVY TREAD OF THE TROOPER AS HE FOLLOWED THE BLACK TO THE DOOR OF THE PARLOR RANG IN THE EARS OF THE FEMALES AS IT APPROACHED NEARER AND NEARER
200-126784-0021 AND DROVE THE BLOOD FROM THEIR FACES TO THEIR HEARTS WITH A CHILL THAT NEARLY ANNIHILATED FEELING A MAN WHOSE COLOSSAL STATURE MANIFESTED THE POSSESSION OF VAST STRENGTH ENTERED THE ROOM AND REMOVING HIS CAP
200-126784-0022 HIS APPEARANCE DID NOT INDICATE AS BELONGING TO HIS NATURE HIS DARK HAIR HUNG AROUND HIS BROW IN PROFUSION THOUGH STAINED WITH POWDER WHICH WAS WORN AT THAT DAY AND HIS FACE WAS NEARLY HID IN THE WHISKERS BY WHICH IT WAS DISFIGURED
200-126784-0023 STILL THE EXPRESSION OF HIS EYE THOUGH PIERCING WAS NOT BAD AND HIS VOICE THOUGH DEEP AND POWERFUL WAS FAR FROM UNPLEASANT FRANCES VENTURED TO THROW A TIMID GLANCE AT HIS FIGURE AS HE ENTERED
200-126784-0024 AND SAW AT ONCE THE MAN FROM WHOSE SCRUTINY HARVEY BIRCH HAD WARNED THEM THERE WAS SO MUCH TO BE APPREHENDED YOU HAVE NO CAUSE FOR ALARM LADIES SAID THE OFFICER PAUSING A MOMENT AND CONTEMPLATING THE PALE FACES AROUND HIM
200-126784-0025 MY BUSINESS WILL BE CONFINED TO A FEW QUESTIONS WHICH IF FREELY ANSWERED WILL INSTANTLY REMOVE US FROM YOUR DWELLING AND WHAT MAY THEY BE SIR STAMMERED MISTER WHARTON
200-126784-0026 RISING FROM HIS CHAIR AND WAITING ANXIOUSLY FOR THE REPLY HAS THERE BEEN A STRANGE GENTLEMAN STAYING WITH YOU DURING THE STORM CONTINUED THE DRAGOON SPEAKING WITH INTEREST AND IN SOME DEGREE SHARING IN THE EVIDENT ANXIETY OF THE FATHER
200-126784-0027 AND HAS NOT YET DEPARTED THIS GENTLEMAN REPEATED THE OTHER TURNING TO CAPTAIN WHARTON AND CONTEMPLATING HIS FIGURE FOR A MOMENT
200-126784-0028 HE APPROACHED THE YOUTH WITH AN AIR OF COMIC GRAVITY AND WITH A LOW BOW CONTINUED I AM SORRY FOR THE SEVERE COLD YOU HAVE IN YOUR HEAD SIR I EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN IN SURPRISE
200-126784-0029 I HAVE NO COLD IN MY HEAD I FANCIED IT THEN FROM SEEING YOU HAD COVERED SUCH HANDSOME BLACK LOCKS WITH THAT UGLY OLD WIG IT WAS MY MISTAKE YOU WILL PLEASE TO PARDON IT
200-126784-0030 MISTER WHARTON GROANED ALOUD BUT THE LADIES IGNORANT OF THE EXTENT OF THEIR VISITOR'S KNOWLEDGE REMAINED IN TREMBLING YET RIGID SILENCE THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF MOVED HIS HAND INVOLUNTARILY TO HIS HEAD
200-126784-0031 AND DISCOVERED THAT THE TREPIDATION OF HIS SISTERS HAD LEFT SOME OF HIS NATURAL HAIR EXPOSED THE DRAGOON WATCHED THE MOVEMENT WITH A CONTINUED SMILE WHEN SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HIMSELF TURNING TO THE FATHER HE PROCEEDED
200-126784-0032 MISTER HARPER ECHOED THE OTHER FEELING A LOAD REMOVED FROM HIS HEART YES I HAD FORGOTTEN BUT HE IS GONE AND IF THERE BE ANYTHING WRONG IN HIS CHARACTER WE ARE IN ENTIRE IGNORANCE OF IT
200-126784-0033 TO ME HE WAS A TOTAL STRANGER YOU HAVE BUT LITTLE TO APPREHEND FROM HIS CHARACTER ANSWERED THE DRAGOON DRYLY BUT HE IS GONE HOW WHEN AND WHITHER
200-126784-0034 HIS COUNTENANCE GRADUALLY LIGHTING INTO A SMILE OF PLEASURE
200-126784-0035 HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND LEFT THE APARTMENT THE WHARTONS JUDGING FROM HIS MANNER THOUGHT HE WAS ABOUT TO PROCEED IN QUEST OF THE OBJECT OF HIS INQUIRIES THEY OBSERVED THE DRAGOON ON
200-126784-0036 GAINING THE LAWN IN EARNEST AND APPARENTLY PLEASED CONVERSATION WITH HIS TWO SUBALTERNS IN A FEW MOMENTS ORDERS WERE GIVEN TO SOME OF THE TROOPS AND HORSEMEN LEFT THE VALLEY AT FULL SPEED BY ITS VARIOUS ROADS
200-126784-0037 THE SUSPENSE OF THE PARTY WITHIN WHO WERE ALL HIGHLY INTERESTED WITNESSES OF THIS SCENE
2002-139469-0000 SOME DISORDER HAD SURELY CREPT INTO THE COURSE OF THE ELEMENTS DESTROYING THEIR BENIGNANT INFLUENCE THE WIND PRINCE OF AIR RAGED THROUGH HIS KINGDOM LASHING THE SEA INTO FURY
2002-139469-0001 AND SUBDUING THE REBEL EARTH INTO SOME SORT OF OBEDIENCE THE GOD SENDS DOWN HIS ANGRY PLAGUES FROM HIGH FAMINE AND PESTILENCE IN HEAPS THEY DIE AGAIN IN VENGEANCE OF HIS WRATH HE FALLS
2002-139469-0002 ON THEIR GREAT HOSTS AND BREAKS THEIR TOTTERING WALLS ARRESTS THEIR NAVIES ON THE OCEAN'S PLAIN AND WHELMS THEIR STRENGTH WITH MOUNTAINS OF THE MAIN
2002-139469-0003 THEIR DEADLY POWER SHOOK THE FLOURISHING COUNTRIES OF THE SOUTH AND DURING WINTER EVEN WE IN OUR NORTHERN RETREAT BEGAN TO QUAKE UNDER THEIR ILL EFFECTS
2002-139469-0004 THAT FABLE IS UNJUST WHICH GIVES THE SUPERIORITY TO THE SUN OVER THE WIND WHO HAS NOT SEEN THE LIGHTSOME EARTH THE BALMY ATMOSPHERE AND BASKING NATURE BECOME DARK COLD
2002-139469-0005 AND UNGENIAL WHEN THE SLEEPING WIND HAS AWOKE IN THE EAST OR WHEN THE DUN CLOUDS THICKLY VEIL THE SKY
2002-139469-0006 UNTIL THE DANK EARTH REFUSING TO IMBIBE THE SUPERABUNDANT MOISTURE IT LIES IN POOLS ON THE SURFACE WHEN THE TORCH OF DAY SEEMS LIKE A METEOR TO BE QUENCHED
2002-139469-0007 WHO HAS NOT SEEN THE CLOUD STIRRING NORTH ARISE THE STREAKED BLUE APPEAR AND SOON AN OPENING MADE IN THE VAPOURS IN THE EYE OF THE WIND THROUGH WHICH THE BRIGHT AZURE SHINES
2002-139469-0008 THE CLOUDS BECOME THIN AN ARCH IS FORMED FOR EVER RISING UPWARDS TILL THE UNIVERSAL COPE BEING UNVEILED THE SUN POURS FORTH ITS RAYS RE ANIMATED AND FED BY THE BREEZE
2002-139469-0009 THEN MIGHTY ART THOU O WIND TO BE THRONED ABOVE ALL
2002-139469-0010 WHETHER THOU COMEST DESTROYING FROM THE EAST OR PREGNANT WITH ELEMENTARY LIFE FROM THE WEST THEE THE CLOUDS OBEY THE SUN IS SUBSERVIENT TO THEE THE SHORELESS
2002-139469-0011 OCEAN IS THY SLAVE THOU SWEEPEST OVER THE EARTH AND OAKS THE GROWTH OF CENTURIES SUBMIT TO THY VIEWLESS AXE THE SNOW DRIFT IS SCATTERED ON THE PINNACLES OF THE ALPS
2002-139469-0012 THE AVALANCHE THUNDERS DOWN THEIR VALLIES THOU HOLDEST THE KEYS OF THE FROST AND CANST FIRST CHAIN AND THEN SET FREE THE STREAMS UNDER THY GENTLE GOVERNANCE THE BUDS AND LEAVES ARE BORN
2002-139469-0013 THEY FLOURISH NURSED BY THEE WHY DOST THOU HOWL THUS O WIND BY DAY AND BY NIGHT FOR FOUR LONG MONTHS THY ROARINGS HAVE NOT CEASED THE SHORES OF THE SEA ARE STREWN WITH WRECKS
2002-139469-0014 THE EARTH HAS SHED HER BEAUTY IN OBEDIENCE TO THY COMMAND THE FRAIL BALLOON DARES NO LONGER SAIL ON THE AGITATED AIR THY MINISTERS THE CLOUDS DELUGE THE LAND WITH RAIN
2002-139469-0015 RIVERS FORSAKE THEIR BANKS THE WILD TORRENT TEARS UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH PLAIN AND WOOD AND VERDANT DELL ARE DESPOILED OF THEIR LOVELINESS
2002-139469-0016 OUR VERY CITIES ARE WASTED BY THEE ALAS WHAT WILL BECOME OF US IT SEEMS AS IF THE GIANT WAVES OF OCEAN AND VAST ARMS OF THE SEA WERE ABOUT TO WRENCH THE DEEP ROOTED ISLAND FROM ITS CENTRE AND CAST IT
2002-139469-0017 A RUIN AND A WRECK UPON THE FIELDS OF THE ATLANTIC WHAT ARE WE THE INHABITANTS OF THIS GLOBE LEAST AMONG THE MANY THAT PEOPLE INFINITE SPACE OUR MINDS EMBRACE INFINITY
2002-139469-0018 OF OUR BEING IS SUBJECT TO MEREST ACCIDENT DAY BY DAY WE ARE FORCED TO BELIEVE THIS HE WHOM A SCRATCH HAS DISORGANIZED HE WHO DISAPPEARS FROM APPARENT LIFE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE HOSTILE AGENCY AT WORK AROUND US
2002-139469-0019 HAD THE SAME POWERS AS I I
2002-139469-0020 IN THE FACE OF ALL THIS WE CALL OURSELVES LORDS OF THE CREATION WIELDERS OF THE ELEMENTS MASTERS OF LIFE AND DEATH AND WE ALLEGE IN EXCUSE OF THIS ARROGANCE THAT THOUGH THE INDIVIDUAL IS DESTROYED
2002-139469-0021 MAN CONTINUES FOR EVER THUS LOSING OUR IDENTITY THAT OF WHICH WE ARE CHIEFLY CONSCIOUS WE GLORY IN THE CONTINUITY OF OUR SPECIES AND LEARN TO REGARD DEATH WITHOUT TERROR
2002-139469-0022 BUT WHEN ANY WHOLE NATION BECOMES THE VICTIM OF THE DESTRUCTIVE POWERS OF EXTERIOR AGENTS THEN INDEED MAN SHRINKS INTO INSIGNIFICANCE HE FEELS HIS TENURE OF LIFE INSECURE
2002-139469-0023 HIS INHERITANCE ON EARTH CUT OFF I REMEMBER AFTER HAVING WITNESSED THE DESTRUCTIVE EFFECTS OF A FIRE I COULD NOT EVEN BEHOLD A SMALL ONE IN A STOVE WITHOUT A SENSATION OF FEAR
2002-139469-0024 THE MOUNTING FLAMES HAD CURLED ROUND THE BUILDING AS IT FELL AND WAS DESTROYED THEY INSINUATED THEMSELVES INTO THE SUBSTANCES ABOUT THEM
2002-139469-0025 AND THE IMPEDIMENTS TO THEIR PROGRESS YIELDED AT THEIR TOUCH COULD WE TAKE INTEGRAL PARTS OF THIS POWER AND NOT BE SUBJECT TO ITS OPERATION COULD WE DOMESTICATE A CUB OF THIS WILD BEAST
2002-139469-0026 AND NOT FEAR ITS GROWTH AND MATURITY THUS WE BEGAN TO FEEL WITH REGARD TO MANY VISAGED DEATH LET LOOSE ON THE CHOSEN DISTRICTS OF OUR FAIR HABITATION
2002-139469-0027 AND ABOVE ALL WITH REGARD TO THE PLAGUE WE FEARED THE COMING SUMMER NATIONS BORDERING ON THE ALREADY INFECTED COUNTRIES BEGAN TO ENTER UPON SERIOUS PLANS FOR THE BETTER KEEPING OUT OF THE ENEMY
2002-139469-0028 WE A COMMERCIAL PEOPLE WERE OBLIGED TO BRING SUCH SCHEMES UNDER CONSIDERATION AND THE QUESTION OF CONTAGION BECAME MATTER OF EARNEST DISQUISITION
2002-139469-0029 THAT THE PLAGUE WAS NOT WHAT IS COMMONLY CALLED CONTAGIOUS LIKE THE SCARLET FEVER OR EXTINCT SMALL POX WAS PROVED IT WAS CALLED AN EPIDEMIC BUT THE GRAND QUESTION
2002-139469-0030 WAS STILL UNSETTLED OF HOW THIS EPIDEMIC WAS GENERATED AND INCREASED IF INFECTION DEPENDED UPON THE AIR THE AIR WAS SUBJECT TO INFECTION
2002-139469-0031 HAS BEEN BROUGHT BY SHIPS TO ONE SEA PORT TOWN YET THE VERY PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT IT THERE WERE INCAPABLE OF COMMUNICATING IT IN A TOWN MORE FORTUNATELY SITUATED BUT HOW ARE WE TO JUDGE OF AIRS
2002-139469-0032 AND PRONOUNCE IN SUCH A CITY PLAGUE WILL DIE UNPRODUCTIVE IN SUCH ANOTHER NATURE HAS PROVIDED FOR IT A PLENTIFUL HARVEST
2002-139469-0033 IN THE SAME WAY INDIVIDUALS MAY ESCAPE NINETY NINE TIMES AND RECEIVE THE DEATH BLOW AT THE HUNDREDTH BECAUSE BODIES ARE SOMETIMES
2002-139469-0034 THESE REFLECTIONS MADE OUR LEGISLATORS PAUSE BEFORE THEY COULD DECIDE ON THE LAWS TO BE PUT IN FORCE THE EVIL WAS SO WIDE SPREADING SO VIOLENT AND IMMEDICABLE THAT NO CARE NO PREVENTION COULD BE JUDGED SUPERFLUOUS
2002-139469-0035 WHICH EVEN ADDED A CHANCE TO OUR ESCAPE THESE WERE QUESTIONS OF PRUDENCE THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE NECESSITY FOR AN EARNEST CAUTION ENGLAND WAS STILL SECURE FRANCE
2002-139469-0036 GERMANY ITALY AND SPAIN WERE INTERPOSED WALLS YET WITHOUT A BREACH BETWEEN US AND THE PLAGUE OUR VESSELS TRULY WERE THE SPORT OF WINDS AND WAVES EVEN AS GULLIVER
2002-139469-0037 BROBDIGNAGIANS BUT WE ON OUR STABLE ABODE COULD NOT BE HURT IN LIFE OR LIMB BY THESE ERUPTIONS OF NATURE WE COULD NOT FEAR WE DID NOT YET A FEELING OF AWE
2002-139469-0038 A BREATHLESS SENTIMENT OF WONDER A PAINFUL SENSE
2002-139469-0039 DEGRADATION OF HUMANITY WAS INTRODUCED INTO EVERY HEART NATURE OUR MOTHER AND OUR FRIEND HAD TURNED ON US A BROW OF MENACE SHE SHEWED US PLAINLY THAT THOUGH SHE PERMITTED US TO ASSIGN HER LAWS AND SUBDUE HER APPARENT POWERS
2002-139469-0040 WE MUST QUAKE SHE COULD TAKE OUR GLOBE
2002-139469-0041 AND ALL THAT MAN'S MIND COULD INVENT OR HIS FORCE ACHIEVE SHE COULD TAKE THE BALL IN HER HAND AND CAST IT INTO SPACE WHERE LIFE WOULD BE DRUNK UP AND MAN AND ALL HIS EFFORTS FOR EVER ANNIHILATED
2002-139469-0042 THESE SPECULATIONS WERE RIFE AMONG US YET NOT THE LESS WE PROCEEDED IN OUR DAILY OCCUPATIONS AND OUR PLANS WHOSE ACCOMPLISHMENT DEMANDED THE LAPSE OF MANY YEARS NO VOICE WAS HEARD TELLING US TO HOLD
2002-139469-0043 WHEN FOREIGN DISTRESSES CAME TO BE FELT BY US THROUGH THE CHANNELS OF COMMERCE WE SET OURSELVES TO APPLY REMEDIES SUBSCRIPTIONS WERE MADE FOR THE EMIGRANTS AND MERCHANTS BANKRUPT BY THE FAILURE OF TRADE
2002-139469-0044 THE ENGLISH SPIRIT AWOKE TO ITS FULL ACTIVITY AND AS IT HAD EVER DONE SET ITSELF TO RESIST THE EVIL AND TO STAND IN THE BREACH WHICH DISEASED NATURE HAD SUFFERED CHAOS AND DEATH TO MAKE
2002-139469-0045 IN THE BOUNDS AND BANKS WHICH HAD HITHERTO KEPT THEM OUT AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF SUMMER WE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT THE MISCHIEF WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE IN DISTANT COUNTRIES WAS GREATER THAN WE HAD AT FIRST SUSPECTED
2002-139469-0046 QUITO WAS DESTROYED BY AN EARTHQUAKE MEXICO LAID WASTE BY THE UNITED EFFECTS OF STORM PESTILENCE AND FAMINE CROWDS OF EMIGRANTS INUNDATED THE WEST OF EUROPE
2002-139469-0047 AND OUR ISLAND HAD BECOME THE REFUGE OF THOUSANDS IN THE MEAN TIME
2002-139469-0048 HE HAD SOUGHT THIS OFFICE WITH EAGERNESS UNDER THE IDEA OF TURNING HIS WHOLE FORCES TO THE SUPPRESSION OF THE PRIVILEGED ORDERS OF OUR COMMUNITY
2002-139469-0049 AT LENGTH FORBADE A RECOURSE TO THE USUAL MODES OF RELIEF TRADE WAS STOPPED BY THE FAILURE OF THE INTERCHANGE OF CARGOES USUAL BETWEEN US AND AMERICA INDIA EGYPT AND GREECE
2002-139469-0050 IN VAIN OUR PROTECTOR AND HIS PARTIZANS SOUGHT TO CONCEAL THIS TRUTH IN VAIN DAY AFTER DAY HE APPOINTED A PERIOD FOR THE DISCUSSION OF THE NEW LAWS CONCERNING HEREDITARY RANK AND PRIVILEGE
2002-139469-0051 IN VAIN HE ENDEAVOURED TO REPRESENT THE EVIL AS PARTIAL AND TEMPORARY THESE DISASTERS CAME HOME TO SO MANY BOSOMS AND THROUGH THE VARIOUS CHANNELS OF COMMERCE WERE CARRIED SO
2002-139469-0052 ENTIRELY INTO EVERY CLASS AND DIVISION OF THE COMMUNITY THAT OF NECESSITY THEY BECAME THE FIRST QUESTION IN THE STATE THE CHIEF SUBJECTS TO WHICH WE MUST TURN OUR ATTENTION
2002-139469-0053 CAN IT BE TRUE EACH ASKED THE OTHER WITH WONDER AND DISMAY THAT WHOLE COUNTRIES ARE LAID WASTE WHOLE NATIONS ANNIHILATED BY THESE DISORDERS IN NATURE THE VAST CITIES OF AMERICA THE FERTILE PLAINS OF
2002-139469-0054 HINDOSTAN THE CROWDED ABODES OF THE CHINESE ARE MENACED WITH UTTER RUIN WHERE LATE THE BUSY MULTITUDES ASSEMBLED FOR PLEASURE OR PROFIT
2002-139469-0055 NOW ONLY THE SOUND OF WAILING AND MISERY IS HEARD THE AIR IS EMPOISONED AND EACH HUMAN BEING INHALES DEATH EVEN WHILE IN YOUTH AND HEALTH THEIR HOPES ARE IN THE FLOWER
2002-139469-0056 WE CALLED TO MIND THE PLAGUE OF THIRTEEN FORTY EIGHT WHEN IT WAS CALCULATED THAT A THIRD OF MANKIND HAD BEEN DESTROYED AS YET WESTERN EUROPE WAS UNINFECTED WOULD IT ALWAYS BE SO
2002-139469-0057 O YES IT WOULD COUNTRYMEN FEAR NOT IN THE STILL UNCULTIVATED WILDS OF AMERICA WHAT WONDER THAT AMONG ITS OTHER GIANT DESTROYERS PLAGUE SHOULD BE NUMBERED
2002-139469-0058 IT WOULD EXPIRE IN THESE CLIMES IT DRINKS THE DARK BLOOD OF THE INHABITANT OF THE SOUTH BUT IT NEVER FEASTS ON THE PALE FACED CELT IF
2002-139469-0059 PERCHANCE SOME STRICKEN ASIATIC
2002-139469-0060 PLAGUE DIES WITH HIM UNCOMMUNICATED AND INNOXIOUS LET US WEEP FOR OUR BRETHREN THOUGH WE CAN NEVER EXPERIENCE THEIR REVERSE
2002-139469-0061 LET US LAMENT OVER AND ASSIST THE CHILDREN OF THE GARDEN OF THE EARTH LATE WE ENVIED THEIR ABODES THEIR SPICY GROVES FERTILE PLAINS AND ABUNDANT LOVELINESS BUT IN THIS MORTAL LIFE EXTREMES ARE ALWAYS MATCHED
2002-139469-0062 THE THORN GROWS WITH THE ROSE THE POISON TREE AND THE CINNAMON MINGLE THEIR BOUGHS
2002-139469-0063 MARBLE HALLS AND INFINITE WEALTH IS NOW A TOMB THE TENT OF THE ARAB IS FALLEN IN THE SANDS AND HIS HORSE SPURNS THE GROUND UNBRIDLED AND UNSADDLED THE VOICE OF LAMENTATION FILLS THE VALLEY OF CASHMERE
2002-139469-0064 ITS DELLS AND WOODS ITS COOL FOUNTAINS AND GARDENS OF ROSES ARE POLLUTED BY THE DEAD IN CIRCASSIA AND GEORGIA THE SPIRIT OF BEAUTY WEEPS OVER THE RUIN OF ITS FAVOURITE TEMPLE THE FORM OF WOMAN
2002-139469-0065 OUR OWN DISTRESSES THOUGH THEY WERE OCCASIONED BY THE FICTITIOUS RECIPROCITY OF COMMERCE ENCREASED IN DUE PROPORTION BANKERS MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS
2002-139469-0066 WHOSE TRADE DEPENDED ON EXPORTS AND INTERCHANGE OF WEALTH BECAME BANKRUPT SUCH THINGS WHEN THEY HAPPEN SINGLY AFFECT ONLY THE IMMEDIATE PARTIES BUT THE PROSPERITY OF THE NATION WAS NOW SHAKEN BY FREQUENT AND EXTENSIVE LOSSES
2002-139469-0067 FAMILIES BRED IN OPULENCE AND LUXURY WERE REDUCED TO BEGGARY THE VERY STATE OF PEACE IN WHICH WE GLORIED WAS INJURIOUS THERE WERE NO MEANS OF EMPLOYING THE IDLE
2002-139469-0068 EVEN THE SOURCE OF COLONIES WAS DRIED UP FOR IN NEW HOLLAND
2002-139469-0069 AND THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE PLAGUE RAGED
2002-139469-0070 AND BRING BACK THE EARTH TO ITS ACCUSTOMED HEALTH
2002-139469-0071 AT THE MULTITUDE OF EVILS THAT GATHERED ROUND US MUST HE TAX THE LANDED INTEREST TO ASSIST OUR COMMERCIAL POPULATION TO DO THIS HE MUST GAIN THE FAVOUR OF THE CHIEF LAND HOLDERS THE NOBILITY OF THE COUNTRY
2002-139469-0072 AND THESE WERE HIS VOWED ENEMIES HE MUST CONCILIATE THEM BY ABANDONING HIS FAVOURITE SCHEME OF EQUALIZATION HE MUST CONFIRM THEM
2002-139469-0073 HE MUST SELL HIS CHERISHED PLANS FOR THE PERMANENT GOOD OF HIS COUNTRY FOR TEMPORARY RELIEF HE MUST AIM NO MORE AT THE DEAR OBJECT OF HIS AMBITION
2002-139469-0074 THROWING HIS ARMS ASIDE HE MUST FOR PRESENT ENDS GIVE UP THE ULTIMATE OBJECT OF HIS ENDEAVOURS HE CAME TO WINDSOR TO CONSULT WITH US EVERY DAY ADDED TO HIS DIFFICULTIES
2002-139469-0075 THE ARRIVAL OF FRESH VESSELS WITH EMIGRANTS THE TOTAL CESSATION OF COMMERCE THE STARVING MULTITUDE THAT THRONGED AROUND THE PALACE OF THE PROTECTORATE WERE CIRCUMSTANCES NOT TO BE TAMPERED WITH
2002-139469-0076 THE BLOW WAS STRUCK THE ARISTOCRACY OBTAINED ALL THEY WISHED AND THEY SUBSCRIBED TO A TWELVEMONTHS BILL WHICH LEVIED TWENTY PER CENT ON ALL THE RENT ROLLS OF THE COUNTRY
2002-139469-0077 CALM WAS NOW RESTORED TO THE METROPOLIS AND TO THE POPULOUS CITIES BEFORE DRIVEN TO DESPERATION AND WE RETURNED TO THE CONSIDERATION OF DISTANT CALAMITIES WONDERING IF THE FUTURE WOULD BRING ANY ALLEVIATION
2002-139469-0078 TO THEIR EXCESS IT WAS AUGUST SO THERE COULD BE SMALL HOPE OF RELIEF DURING THE HEATS ON THE CONTRARY
2002-139469-0079 WHILE STARVATION DID ITS ACCUSTOMED WORK THOUSANDS DIED UNLAMENTED FOR BESIDE THE YET WARM CORPSE THE MOURNER WAS STRETCHED MADE MUTE BY DEATH
2002-139469-0080 ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF THIS MONTH NEWS ARRIVED IN LONDON THAT THE PLAGUE WAS IN FRANCE AND ITALY THESE TIDINGS WERE AT FIRST WHISPERED ABOUT TOWN BUT NO ONE DARED EXPRESS ALOUD THE SOUL QUAILING INTELLIGENCE
2002-139469-0081 WHEN ANY ONE MET A FRIEND IN THE STREET HE ONLY CRIED AS HE HURRIED ON YOU KNOW WHILE THE OTHER WITH AN EJACULATION OF FEAR AND HORROR WOULD ANSWER
2002-139469-0082 WHAT WILL BECOME OF US AT LENGTH IT WAS MENTIONED IN THE NEWSPAPERS THE PARAGRAPH WAS INSERTED IN AN OBSCURE PART WE REGRET TO STATE
2002-139469-0083 THAT THERE CAN BE NO LONGER A DOUBT OF THE PLAGUE HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED AT LEGHORN GENOA AND MARSEILLES NO WORD OF COMMENT FOLLOWED
2002-139469-0084 WE WERE AS A MAN WHO HEARS THAT HIS HOUSE IS BURNING AND YET HURRIES THROUGH THE STREETS BORNE ALONG BY A LURKING HOPE OF A MISTAKE
2002-139469-0085 AND SEES HIS SHELTERING ROOF ENVELOPED IN A FLAME BEFORE IT HAD BEEN A RUMOUR BUT NOW IN WORDS UNERASEABLE IN DEFINITE AND UNDENIABLE PRINT THE KNOWLEDGE WENT FORTH
2002-139469-0086 ITS OBSCURITY OF SITUATION RENDERED IT THE MORE CONSPICUOUS THE DIMINUTIVE LETTERS GREW GIGANTIC TO THE BEWILDERED EYE OF FEAR THEY SEEMED GRAVEN
2002-139469-0087 WITH A PEN OF IRON IMPRESSED BY FIRE WOVEN IN THE CLOUDS STAMPED ON THE VERY FRONT OF THE UNIVERSE THE ENGLISH
2002-139469-0088 WHETHER TRAVELLERS OR RESIDENTS CAME POURING IN ONE GREAT REVULSIVE STREAM BACK ON THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND WITH THEM CROWDS OF ITALIANS AND SPANIARDS
2002-139469-0089 OUR LITTLE ISLAND WAS FILLED EVEN TO BURSTING AT FIRST AN UNUSUAL QUANTITY OF SPECIE MADE ITS APPEARANCE WITH THE EMIGRANTS BUT THESE PEOPLE HAD NO MEANS OF RECEIVING BACK INTO THEIR HANDS WHAT THEY SPENT AMONG US
2002-139469-0090 RENTS WERE UNPAID AND THEIR REMITTANCES FAILED THEM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE THESE CROWDS OF WRETCHED PERISHING CREATURES LATE NURSLINGS OF LUXURY
2002-139469-0091 AND NOT STRETCH OUT A HAND TO SAVE THEM AS AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THE ENGLISH UNLOCKED THEIR HOSPITABLE STORE FOR THE RELIEF OF THOSE DRIVEN FROM THEIR HOMES BY POLITICAL REVOLUTION
2002-139469-0092 SO NOW THEY WERE NOT BACKWARD IN AFFORDING AID TO THE VICTIMS OF A MORE WIDE SPREADING CALAMITY WE HAD MANY FOREIGN FRIENDS WHOM WE EAGERLY SOUGHT OUT AND RELIEVED FROM DREADFUL PENURY
2002-139469-0093 OUR CASTLE BECAME AN ASYLUM FOR THE UNHAPPY A LITTLE POPULATION OCCUPIED ITS HALLS THE REVENUE OF ITS POSSESSOR WHICH HAD ALWAYS FOUND A MODE OF EXPENDITURE CONGENIAL TO HIS GENEROUS NATURE
2002-139469-0094 WAS NOW ATTENDED TO MORE PARSIMONIOUSLY THAT IT MIGHT EMBRACE A WIDER PORTION OF UTILITY IT WAS NOT HOWEVER MONEY EXCEPT PARTIALLY BUT THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE
2002-139469-0095 THAT BECAME SCARCE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FIND AN IMMEDIATE REMEDY THE USUAL ONE OF IMPORTS WAS ENTIRELY CUT OFF IN THIS EMERGENCY TO FEED THE VERY PEOPLE TO WHOM WE HAD GIVEN REFUGE WE WERE OBLIGED TO YIELD TO THE PLOUGH

2002-139469-0097 WERE OBLIGED TO FALL FOR THE SAKE OF WORTHIER PENSIONERS THE LABOUR NECESSARY TO BRING THE LANDS TO THIS SORT OF CULTURE EMPLOYED AND FED THE OFFCASTS OF THE DIMINISHED MANUFACTORIES
2002-139469-0098 ADRIAN DID NOT REST ONLY WITH THE EXERTIONS HE COULD MAKE WITH REGARD TO HIS OWN POSSESSIONS HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE WEALTHY OF THE LAND HE MADE PROPOSALS IN PARLIAMENT LITTLE ADAPTED TO PLEASE THE RICH
2002-139469-0099 EARNEST PLEADINGS AND BENEVOLENT ELOQUENCE WERE IRRESISTIBLE TO GIVE UP THEIR PLEASURE GROUNDS TO THE AGRICULTURIST TO DIMINISH SENSIBLY THE NUMBER OF HORSES KEPT FOR THE PURPOSES OF LUXURY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
2002-139469-0100 YET TO THE HONOUR OF THE ENGLISH BE IT RECORDED THAT ALTHOUGH NATURAL
2002-139469-0101 MADE THEM DELAY AWHILE YET WHEN THE MISERY OF THEIR FELLOW CREATURES BECAME GLARING AN ENTHUSIASTIC GENEROSITY INSPIRED THEIR DECREES
2002-139469-0102 THE MOST LUXURIOUS WERE OFTEN THE FIRST TO PART WITH THEIR INDULGENCIES AS IS COMMON IN COMMUNITIES A FASHION WAS SET THE HIGH BORN LADIES OF THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE DEEMED THEMSELVES DISGRACED
2002-139469-0103 IF THEY HAD NOW ENJOYED WHAT THEY BEFORE CALLED A NECESSARY THE EASE OF A CARRIAGE CHAIRS AS IN OLDEN TIME AND INDIAN PALANQUINS WERE INTRODUCED FOR THE INFIRM
2002-139469-0104 BUT ELSE IT WAS NOTHING SINGULAR TO SEE FEMALES OF RANK GOING ON FOOT TO PLACES OF FASHIONABLE RESORT IT WAS MORE COMMON FOR ALL WHO POSSESSED LANDED PROPERTY TO SECEDE TO THEIR ESTATES
2002-139469-0105 ATTENDED BY WHOLE TROOPS OF THE INDIGENT TO CUT DOWN THEIR WOODS TO ERECT TEMPORARY DWELLINGS AND TO PORTION OUT THEIR PARKS PARTERRES AND FLOWER GARDENS

2002-139469-0107 TO CHECK THE SPIRIT OF SACRIFICE AND TO REMIND THOSE WHOSE GENEROSITY PROCEEDED TO LAVISH WASTE THAT UNTIL THE PRESENT STATE OF THINGS BECAME PERMANENT OF WHICH THERE WAS NO LIKELIHOOD
2002-139469-0108 SO FAR AS TO MAKE A REACTION DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE DEMONSTRATED THAT IN A YEAR OR TWO PESTILENCE WOULD CEASE IT WERE WELL THAT IN THE MEAN TIME
2002-139469-0109 WE SHOULD NOT HAVE DESTROYED OUR FINE BREEDS OF HORSES OR HAVE UTTERLY CHANGED THE FACE OF THE ORNAMENTED PORTION OF THE COUNTRY
2002-139469-0110 THE INFECTION HAD NOW SPREAD IN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCES OF FRANCE BUT THAT COUNTRY HAD SO MANY RESOURCES IN THE WAY OF AGRICULTURE
2002-139469-0111 AND ITS INCREASE THROUGH FOREIGN EMIGRATION WAS LESS FELT THAN WITH US THE PANIC STRUCK APPEARED OF MORE INJURY THAN DISEASE AND ITS NATURAL
2002-139469-0112 CONCOMITANTS WINTER WAS HAILED A GENERAL AND NEVER FAILING PHYSICIAN
2002-139469-0113 WERE WELCOMED WITH GRATITUDE THE EFFECTS OF PURIFYING COLD WERE IMMEDIATELY FELT AND THE LISTS OF MORTALITY ABROAD WERE

2007-132570-0008 YES HE DID INDEED MA'AMSELLE NOTWITHSTANDING ALL I COULD SAY TO THE CONTRARY
2007-132570-0009 AND HE MISTOOK LUDOVICO'S HALL FOR OLD CARLO'S
2007-132570-0010 SO WE WERE ALL AS STILL AS NIGHT THAT HE MIGHT SUPPOSE THERE WAS NOBODY IN THE ROOM BUT THE SIGNOR WAS AS CUNNING AS THE BEST OF US AND KEPT CALLING OUT AT THE DOOR
2007-132570-0011 COME FORTH MY VALOROUS SIGNOR STEWARD JUST THEN OLD CARLO OPENED HIS DOOR AND HE CAME WITH A FLASK IN HIS HAND FOR AS SOON AS THE SIGNOR SAW HIM
2007-132570-0012 HE WAS AS TAME AS COULD BE AND FOLLOWED HIM AWAY AS NATURALLY AS A DOG DOES A BUTCHER WITH A PIECE OF MEAT IN HIS BASKET ALL THIS I SAW THROUGH THE KEY HOLE WELL ANNETTE SAID LUDOVICO JEERINGLY SHALL I LET YOU OUT NOW
2007-132570-0013 INTERRUPTED EMILY QUITE WEARIED BY THIS STORY DO YOU KNOW WHETHER THERE ARE ANY PRISONERS IN THE CASTLE AND WHETHER THEY ARE CONFINED AT THIS END OF THE EDIFICE
2007-132570-0014 BUT IT IS EXPECTED BACK TO NIGHT OR TO MORROW AND I SHALL KNOW THEN PERHAPS EMILY ENQUIRED IF SHE HAD EVER HEARD THE SERVANTS TALK OF PRISONERS AH MA'AMSELLE SAID ANNETTE ARCHLY
2007-132570-0015 NOW I DARE SAY YOU ARE THINKING OF MONSIEUR VALANCOURT AND THAT HE MAY HAVE COME AMONG THE ARMIES WHICH THEY SAY ARE COME FROM OUR COUNTRY TO FIGHT AGAINST THIS STATE AND THAT HE HAS MET WITH SOME OF OUR PEOPLE AND IS TAKEN CAPTIVE
2007-132570-0016 O LORD HOW GLAD I SHOULD BE IF IT WAS SO WOULD YOU INDEED BE GLAD SAID EMILY IN A TONE OF MOURNFUL REPROACH TO BE SURE I SHOULD
2007-132570-0017 MA'AM REPLIED ANNETTE AND WOULD NOT YOU BE GLAD TOO TO SEE SIGNOR VALANCOURT I DON'T KNOW ANY CHEVALIER I LIKE BETTER I HAVE A VERY GREAT REGARD FOR THE SIGNOR TRULY
2007-132570-0018 YOUR REGARD FOR HIM CANNOT BE DOUBTED SAID EMILY SINCE YOU WISH TO SEE HIM A PRISONER WHY NO MA'AMSELLE NOT A PRISONER EITHER BUT ONE MUST BE GLAD TO SEE HIM YOU KNOW AND IT WAS ONLY THE OTHER NIGHT I DREAMT
2007-132570-0019 AND THEN IT WAS GONE AND NOTHING TO BE SEEN BUT THE OLD CASTLE WALLS SO THEY HELPED ONE ANOTHER UP AGAIN AS FAST AS THEY COULD YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE MA'AMSELLE THOUGH I SHEWED YOU THE VERY CANNON WHERE IT USED TO APPEAR
2007-132570-0020 AND ARE YOU INDEED SO SIMPLE ANNETTE SAID EMILY SMILING AT THIS CURIOUS EXAGGERATION OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES SHE HAD WITNESSED AS TO CREDIT THESE STORIES CREDIT THEM MA'AMSELLE WHY
2007-132570-0021 ALL THE WORLD COULD NOT PERSUADE ME OUT OF THEM ROBERTO AND SEBASTIAN AND HALF A DOZEN MORE OF THEM WENT INTO FITS TO BE SURE THERE WAS NO OCCASION FOR THAT I SAID MYSELF THERE WAS NO NEED OF THAT
2007-132570-0022 FOR SAYS I WHEN THE ENEMY COMES WHAT A PRETTY FIGURE THEY WILL CUT IF THEY ARE TO FALL DOWN IN FITS ALL OF A ROW THE ENEMY WON'T BE SO CIVIL PERHAPS AS TO WALK OFF LIKE THE GHOST AND LEAVE THEM TO HELP ONE ANOTHER UP
2007-132570-0023 BUT WILL FALL TO CUTTING AND SLASHING TILL HE MAKES THEM ALL RISE UP DEAD MEN NO NO SAYS I THERE IS REASON IN ALL THINGS
2007-132570-0024 BEING BECAUSE IT IS NO BUSINESS OF MINE TO LOOK GRUFF AND FIGHT BATTLES EMILY ENDEAVOURED TO CORRECT THE SUPERSTITIOUS WEAKNESS OF ANNETTE THOUGH SHE COULD NOT ENTIRELY SUBDUE HER OWN TO WHICH THE LATTER ONLY REPLIED
2007-132570-0025 NAY MA'AMSELLE YOU WILL BELIEVE NOTHING YOU ARE ALMOST AS BAD AS THE SIGNOR HIMSELF WHO WAS IN A GREAT PASSION WHEN THEY TOLD OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND SWORE THAT THE FIRST MAN WHO REPEATED SUCH NONSENSE SHOULD BE THROWN INTO THE DUNGEON UNDER THE EAST TURRET THIS WAS A HARD
2007-132570-0026 BUT I DARE SAY HE HAD OTHER REASONS FOR CALLING IT SO THAN YOU HAVE MA'AM EMILY LOOKED DISPLEASED AND MADE NO REPLY AS SHE MUSED UPON THE RECOLLECTED APPEARANCE WHICH HAD LATELY SO MUCH ALARMED HER AND CONSIDERED THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE FIGURE HAVING STATIONED ITSELF
2007-132570-0027 OPPOSITE TO HER CASEMENT SHE WAS FOR A MOMENT INCLINED TO BELIEVE IT WAS VALANCOURT WHOM SHE HAD SEEN YET IF IT WAS HE WHY DID HE NOT SPEAK TO HER WHEN HE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF DOING SO AND IF HE WAS A PRISONER IN THE CASTLE
2007-132570-0028 AND HE COULD BE HERE IN NO OTHER CHARACTER HOW COULD HE OBTAIN THE MEANS OF WALKING ABROAD ON THE RAMPART
2007-132570-0029 WERE THE SAME OR IF THEY WERE WHETHER THIS WAS VALANCOURT SHE HOWEVER DESIRED THAT ANNETTE WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO LEARN WHETHER ANY PRISONERS WERE IN THE CASTLE AND ALSO THEIR NAMES O DEAR MA'AMSELLE SAID ANNETTE I FORGET TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU BADE ME ASK ABOUT
2007-132570-0030 THE LADIES AS THEY CALL THEMSELVES WHO ARE LATELY COME TO UDOLPHO WHY THAT SIGNORA LIVONA THAT THE SIGNOR BROUGHT TO SEE MY LATE LADY AT VENICE IS HIS MISTRESS NOW AND WAS LITTLE BETTER THEN I DARE SAY AND LUDOVICO SAYS
2007-132570-0031 BUT PRAY BE SECRET MA'AM THAT HIS EXCELLENZA INTRODUCED HER ONLY TO IMPOSE UPON THE WORLD THAT HAD BEGUN TO MAKE FREE WITH HER CHARACTER SO WHEN PEOPLE SAW MY LADY NOTICE HER THEY THOUGHT WHAT THEY HAD HEARD MUST BE SCANDAL
2007-132570-0032 BUT I THOUGHT THEY WERE DISMAL SOUNDS SO SOON AFTER MY POOR LADY'S DEATH TOO
2007-132570-0033 BUT SHE CANNOT HEAR THEM NOW POOR SOUL SAID I EMILY TURNED AWAY TO CONCEAL HER EMOTION AND THEN DESIRED ANNETTE TO GO AND MAKE ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE PRISONERS THAT MIGHT BE IN THE CASTLE
2007-132570-0034 BUT CONJURED HER TO DO IT WITH CAUTION AND ON NO ACCOUNT TO MENTION HER NAME OR THAT OF MONSIEUR VALANCOURT NOW I THINK OF IT MA'AMSELLE SAID ANNETTE I DO BELIEVE THERE ARE PRISONERS FOR I OVERHEARD ONE OF THE SIGNOR'S MEN YESTERDAY
2007-132570-0035 AND SAYING WHAT A FINE THING IT WAS FOR HIS EXCELLENZA TO CATCH UP MEN AND THEY WERE AS GOOD BOOTY AS ANY OTHER BECAUSE OF THE RANSOMS
2007-132570-0036 BECAUSE SAID HE WE DON'T GO SHARES THERE THIS INFORMATION HEIGHTENED EMILY'S IMPATIENCE TO KNOW MORE AND ANNETTE IMMEDIATELY DEPARTED ON HER ENQUIRY THE LATE RESOLUTION OF EMILY TO RESIGN HER ESTATES TO MONTONI NOW GAVE WAY TO NEW CONSIDERATIONS
2007-132570-0037 THE POSSIBILITY THAT VALANCOURT WAS NEAR HER REVIVED HER FORTITUDE AND SHE DETERMINED TO BRAVE THE THREATENED VENGEANCE AT LEAST TILL SHE COULD BE ASSURED WHETHER HE WAS REALLY IN THE CASTLE SHE WAS IN THIS TEMPER OF MIND WHEN SHE RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM MONTONI REQUIRING HER ATTENDANCE IN THE CEDAR PARLOUR
2007-132570-0038 WHICH SHE OBEYED WITH TREMBLING AND ON HER WAY THITHER ENDEAVOURED TO ANIMATE HER FORTITUDE WITH THE IDEA OF VALANCOURT MONTONI WAS ALONE I SENT FOR YOU SAID HE TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY OF RETRACTING YOUR LATE MISTAKEN ASSERTIONS
2007-132570-0039 I WILL CONDESCEND TO ADVISE WHERE I MAY COMMAND
2007-132570-0040 IF I HAVE NO RIGHT IN THESE ESTATES SIR SAID EMILY OF WHAT SERVICE CAN IT BE TO YOU THAT I SHOULD SIGN ANY PAPERS CONCERNING THEM IF THE LANDS ARE YOURS BY LAW YOU CERTAINLY MAY POSSESS THEM WITHOUT MY INTERFERENCE OR MY CONSENT
2007-132570-0041 I WILL HAVE NO MORE ARGUMENT SAID MONTONI WITH A LOOK THAT MADE HER TREMBLE WHAT HAD I BUT TROUBLE TO EXPECT WHEN I CONDESCENDED TO REASON WITH A BABY BUT I WILL BE TRIFLED WITH NO LONGER
2007-132570-0042 LET THE RECOLLECTION OF YOUR AUNT'S SUFFERINGS IN CONSEQUENCE OF HER FOLLY AND OBSTINACY TEACH YOU A LESSON SIGN THE PAPERS EMILY'S RESOLUTION WAS FOR A MOMENT AWED SHE SHRUNK AT THE RECOLLECTIONS HE REVIVED
2007-132570-0043 AND FROM THE VENGEANCE HE THREATENED BUT THEN THE IMAGE OF VALANCOURT WHO SO LONG HAD LOVED HER AND WHO WAS NOW PERHAPS SO NEAR HER CAME TO HER HEART AND TOGETHER WITH THE STRONG FEELINGS OF INDIGNATION WITH WHICH SHE HAD ALWAYS
2007-132570-0044 FROM HER INFANCY REGARDED AN ACT OF INJUSTICE INSPIRED HER WITH A NOBLE THOUGH IMPRUDENT COURAGE SIGN THE PAPERS SAID MONTONI MORE IMPATIENTLY THAN BEFORE NEVER SIR
2007-132570-0045 REPLIED EMILY THAT REQUEST WOULD HAVE PROVED TO ME THE INJUSTICE OF YOUR CLAIM HAD I EVEN BEEN IGNORANT OF MY RIGHT MONTONI TURNED PALE WITH ANGER WHILE HIS QUIVERING LIP AND LURKING EYE MADE HER ALMOST REPENT THE BOLDNESS OF HER SPEECH
2007-132570-0046 THEN ALL MY VENGEANCE FALLS UPON YOU HE EXCLAIMED WITH AN HORRIBLE OATH AND THINK NOT IT SHALL BE DELAYED
2007-132570-0047 YOU HAVE DARED TO QUESTION MY RIGHT NOW DARE TO QUESTION MY POWER I HAVE A PUNISHMENT WHICH YOU THINK NOT OF IT IS TERRIBLE THIS NIGHT THIS VERY NIGHT' THIS
2007-132570-0048 NIGHT REPEATED ANOTHER VOICE MONTONI PAUSED AND TURNED HALF ROUND BUT SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HIMSELF HE PROCEEDED IN A LOWER TONE YOU HAVE LATELY SEEN ONE TERRIBLE EXAMPLE OF OBSTINACY AND FOLLY
2007-132570-0049 YET THIS IT APPEARS HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENT TO DETER YOU
2007-132570-0050 I COULD MAKE YOU TREMBLE AT THE BARE RECITAL HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A GROAN WHICH SEEMED TO RISE FROM UNDERNEATH THE CHAMBER THEY WERE IN AND AS HE THREW A GLANCE ROUND IT IMPATIENCE AND RAGE FLASHED FROM HIS EYES
2007-132570-0051 YET SOMETHING LIKE A SHADE OF FEAR PASSED OVER HIS COUNTENANCE EMILY SAT DOWN IN A CHAIR NEAR THE DOOR FOR THE VARIOUS EMOTIONS SHE HAD SUFFERED NOW ALMOST OVERCAME HER BUT MONTONI PAUSED SCARCELY AN INSTANT AND COMMANDING HIS FEATURES
2007-132570-0052 RESUMED HIS DISCOURSE IN A LOWER YET STERNER VOICE I SAY I COULD GIVE YOU OTHER INSTANCES OF MY POWER AND OF MY CHARACTER WHICH IT SEEMS YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR YOU WOULD NOT DEFY ME
2007-132570-0053 I COULD TELL YOU THAT WHEN ONCE MY RESOLUTION IS TAKEN BUT I AM TALKING TO A BABY LET ME HOWEVER REPEAT THAT TERRIBLE AS ARE THE EXAMPLES I COULD RECITE THE RECITAL COULD NOT NOW BENEFIT YOU
2007-132570-0054 FOR THOUGH YOUR REPENTANCE WOULD PUT AN IMMEDIATE END TO OPPOSITION IT WOULD NOT NOW APPEASE MY INDIGNATION I WILL HAVE VENGEANCE AS WELL AS JUSTICE ANOTHER GROAN FILLED THE PAUSE WHICH MONTONI MADE
2007-132570-0055 LEAVE THE ROOM INSTANTLY SAID HE SEEMING NOT TO NOTICE THIS STRANGE OCCURRENCE WITHOUT POWER TO IMPLORE HIS PITY SHE ROSE TO GO BUT FOUND THAT SHE COULD NOT SUPPORT HERSELF AWE AND TERROR OVERCAME HER AND SHE SUNK AGAIN INTO THE CHAIR
2007-132570-0056 QUIT MY PRESENCE CRIED MONTONI THIS AFFECTATION OF FEAR ILL BECOMES THE HEROINE WHO HAS JUST DARED TO BRAVE MY INDIGNATION DID YOU HEAR NOTHING SIGNOR SAID EMILY TREMBLING AND STILL UNABLE TO LEAVE THE ROOM
2007-132570-0057 I HEARD MY OWN VOICE REJOINED MONTONI STERNLY AND NOTHING ELSE
2007-132570-0058 OBEY MY ORDER REPEATED MONTONI AND FOR THESE FOOL'S TRICKS I WILL SOON DISCOVER BY WHOM THEY ARE PRACTISED EMILY AGAIN ROSE AND EXERTED HERSELF TO THE UTMOST TO LEAVE THE ROOM WHILE MONTONI FOLLOWED HER
2007-132570-0059 BUT INSTEAD OF CALLING ALOUD TO HIS SERVANTS TO SEARCH THE CHAMBER AS HE HAD FORMERLY DONE ON A SIMILAR OCCURRENCE PASSED TO THE RAMPARTS AS IN HER WAY TO THE CORRIDOR SHE RESTED FOR A MOMENT AT AN OPEN CASEMENT EMILY SAW A PARTY OF MONTONI'S TROOPS WINDING DOWN A DISTANT MOUNTAIN
2007-132570-0060 WHOM SHE NOTICED NO FURTHER THAN AS THEY BROUGHT TO HER MIND THE WRETCHED PRISONERS THEY WERE PERHAPS BRINGING TO THE CASTLE AT LENGTH HAVING REACHED HER APARTMENT SHE THREW HERSELF UPON THE COUCH OVERCOME WITH THE NEW HORRORS OF HER SITUATION
2007-149877-0000 ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENING HE DINED AT RECTOR'S A RESTAURANT OF SOME LOCAL FAME WHICH OCCUPIED A BASEMENT AT CLARK AND MONROE STREETS THEREAFTER HE VISITED THE RESORT OF FITZGERALD AND MOY'S IN ADAMS STREET OPPOSITE THE IMPOSING FEDERAL BUILDING
2007-149877-0001 THERE HE LEANED OVER THE SPLENDID BAR AND SWALLOWED A GLASS OF PLAIN WHISKEY AND PURCHASED A COUPLE OF CIGARS ONE OF WHICH HE LIGHTED THIS TO HIM REPRESENTED IN PART HIGH LIFE A FAIR SAMPLE OF WHAT THE WHOLE MUST BE
2007-149877-0002 DROUET WAS NOT A DRINKER IN EXCESS HE WAS NOT A MONEYED MAN HE ONLY CRAVED THE BEST AS HIS MIND CONCEIVED IT AND SUCH DOINGS SEEMED TO HIM A PART OF THE BEST
2007-149877-0003 RECTOR'S WITH ITS POLISHED MARBLE WALLS AND FLOOR ITS PROFUSION OF LIGHTS ITS SHOW OF CHINA AND SILVERWARE AND ABOVE ALL ITS REPUTATION AS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AND PROFESSIONAL MEN SEEMED TO HIM THE PROPER PLACE FOR A SUCCESSFUL MAN TO GO
2007-149877-0004 HE LOVED FINE CLOTHES GOOD EATING AND PARTICULARLY THE COMPANY AND ACQUAINTANCESHIP OF SUCCESSFUL MEN WHEN DINING IT WAS A SOURCE OF KEEN SATISFACTION TO HIM TO KNOW THAT JOSEPH JEFFERSON WAS WONT TO COME TO THIS SAME PLACE
2007-149877-0005 OR THAT HENRY E DIXIE A WELL KNOWN PERFORMER OF THE DAY WAS THEN ONLY A FEW TABLES OFF AT RECTOR'S HE COULD ALWAYS OBTAIN THIS SATISFACTION FOR THERE ONE COULD ENCOUNTER POLITICIANS BROKERS ACTORS
2007-149877-0006 SOME RICH YOUNG ROUNDERS OF THE TOWN ALL EATING AND DRINKING AMID A BUZZ OF POPULAR COMMONPLACE CONVERSATION THAT'S SO AND SO OVER THERE WAS A COMMON REMARK OF THESE GENTLEMEN AMONG THEMSELVES
2007-149877-0007 PARTICULARLY AMONG THOSE WHO HAD NOT YET REACHED BUT HOPED TO DO SO THE DAZZLING HEIGHT WHICH MONEY TO DINE HERE LAVISHLY REPRESENTED YOU DON'T SAY SO WOULD BE THE REPLY WHY
2007-149877-0008 WHY HE'S MANAGER OF THE GRAND OPERA HOUSE WHEN THESE THINGS WOULD FALL UPON DROUET'S EARS HE WOULD STRAIGHTEN HIMSELF A LITTLE MORE STIFFLY AND EAT WITH SOLID COMFORT IF HE HAD ANY VANITY THIS AUGMENTED IT
2007-149877-0009 THE FLOORS WERE OF BRIGHTLY COLOURED TILES THE WALLS A COMPOSITION OF RICH DARK POLISHED WOOD WHICH REFLECTED THE LIGHT AND COLOURED STUCCO WORK WHICH GAVE THE PLACE A VERY SUMPTUOUS APPEARANCE
2007-149877-0010 THE LONG BAR WAS A BLAZE OF LIGHTS POLISHED WOOD WORK COLOURED AND CUT GLASSWARE AND MANY FANCY BOTTLES
2007-149877-0011 WITH RICH SCREENS FANCY WINES AND A LINE OF BAR GOODS UNSURPASSED IN THE COUNTRY AT RECTOR'S DROUET HAD MET MISTER G W HURSTWOOD MANAGER OF FITZGERALD AND MOY'S
2007-149877-0012 HE HAD BEEN POINTED OUT AS A VERY SUCCESSFUL AND WELL KNOWN MAN ABOUT TOWN HURSTWOOD LOOKED THE PART FOR BESIDES BEING SLIGHTLY UNDER FORTY HE HAD A GOOD STOUT CONSTITUTION AN ACTIVE MANNER AND A SOLID SUBSTANTIAL AIR
2007-149877-0013 WHICH WAS COMPOSED IN PART OF HIS FINE CLOTHES HIS CLEAN LINEN HIS JEWELS AND ABOVE ALL HIS OWN SENSE OF HIS IMPORTANCE DROUET IMMEDIATELY CONCEIVED A NOTION OF HIM AS BEING SOME ONE WORTH KNOWING
2007-149877-0014 AND WAS GLAD NOT ONLY TO MEET HIM BUT TO VISIT THE ADAMS STREET BAR THEREAFTER WHENEVER HE WANTED A DRINK OR A CIGAR HURSTWOOD WAS AN INTERESTING CHARACTER AFTER HIS KIND HE WAS SHREWD AND CLEVER IN MANY LITTLE THINGS
2007-149877-0015 AND CAPABLE OF CREATING A GOOD IMPRESSION HIS MANAGERIAL POSITION WAS FAIRLY IMPORTANT A KIND OF STEWARDSHIP WHICH WAS IMPOSING BUT LACKED FINANCIAL CONTROL HE HAD RISEN BY PERSEVERANCE AND INDUSTRY
2007-149877-0016 THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND FINANCIAL FUNCTIONS DEVOLVED UPON THE OWNERS
2007-149877-0017 AND UPON A CASHIER WHO LOOKED AFTER THE MONEY TAKEN IN FOR THE MOST PART HE LOUNGED ABOUT DRESSED IN EXCELLENT TAILORED SUITS OF IMPORTED GOODS A SOLITAIRE RING A FINE BLUE DIAMOND IN HIS TIE A STRIKING VEST OF SOME NEW PATTERN
2007-149877-0018 AND A WATCH CHAIN OF SOLID GOLD WHICH HELD A CHARM OF RICH DESIGN AND A WATCH OF THE LATEST MAKE AND ENGRAVING HE KNEW BY NAME AND COULD GREET PERSONALLY WITH A WELL OLD FELLOW
2007-149877-0019 HUNDREDS OF ACTORS MERCHANTS POLITICIANS AND THE GENERAL RUN OF SUCCESSFUL CHARACTERS ABOUT TOWN AND IT WAS PART OF HIS SUCCESS TO DO SO HE HAD A FINELY GRADUATED SCALE OF INFORMALITY AND FRIENDSHIP WHICH IMPROVED FROM THE HOW DO YOU DO
2007-149877-0020 WHO BY LONG FREQUENTING OF THE PLACE BECAME AWARE OF HIS POSITION TO THE WHY OLD MAN HOW ARE YOU WHICH HE ADDRESSED TO THOSE NOTED OR RICH INDIVIDUALS WHO KNEW HIM AND WERE INCLINED TO BE FRIENDLY THERE WAS A CLASS HOWEVER
2007-149877-0021 TOO RICH TOO FAMOUS OR TOO SUCCESSFUL WITH WHOM HE COULD NOT ATTEMPT ANY FAMILIARITY OF ADDRESS AND WITH THESE HE WAS PROFESSIONALLY TACTFUL ASSUMING A GRAVE AND DIGNIFIED ATTITUDE PAYING THEM THE DEFERENCE WHICH WOULD WIN THEIR GOOD FEELING
2007-149877-0022 WITHOUT IN THE LEAST COMPROMISING HIS OWN BEARING AND OPINIONS THERE WERE IN THE LAST PLACE A FEW GOOD FOLLOWERS NEITHER RICH NOR POOR FAMOUS NOR YET REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL WITH WHOM HE WAS FRIENDLY ON THE SCORE OF GOOD FELLOWSHIP
2007-149877-0023 THESE WERE THE KIND OF MEN WITH WHOM HE WOULD CONVERSE LONGEST AND MOST SERIOUSLY
2007-149877-0024 TO GO TO THE RACES THE THEATRES THE SPORTING ENTERTAINMENTS AT SOME OF THE CLUBS HE KEPT A HORSE AND NEAT TRAP HAD HIS WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN WHO WERE WELL ESTABLISHED IN A NEAT HOUSE ON THE NORTH SIDE NEAR LINCOLN PARK
2007-149877-0025 AND WAS ALTOGETHER A VERY ACCEPTABLE INDIVIDUAL OF OUR GREAT AMERICAN UPPER CLASS THE FIRST GRADE BELOW THE LUXURIOUSLY RICH
2007-149877-0026 THE LATTER'S GENIAL NATURE AND DRESSY APPEARANCE PLEASED HIM HE KNEW THAT DROUET WAS ONLY A TRAVELLING SALESMAN AND NOT ONE OF MANY YEARS AT THAT BUT THE FIRM OF BARTLETT CARYOE AND COMPANY
2007-149877-0027 HURSTWOOD KNEW CARYOE QUITE WELL HAVING DRUNK A GLASS NOW AND THEN WITH HIM IN COMPANY WITH SEVERAL OTHERS WHEN THE CONVERSATION WAS GENERAL
2007-149877-0028 A MODERATE SENSE OF HUMOUR AND COULD TELL A GOOD STORY WHEN THE OCCASION REQUIRED HE COULD TALK RACES WITH HURSTWOOD
2007-149877-0029 AND REPORT THE STATE OF TRADE IN THE CITIES WHICH HE VISITED AND SO MANAGED TO MAKE HIMSELF ALMOST INVARIABLY AGREEABLE TO NIGHT HE WAS PARTICULARLY SO SINCE HIS REPORT TO THE COMPANY HAD BEEN FAVOURABLY COMMENTED UPON
2007-149877-0030 HIS NEW SAMPLES HAD BEEN SATISFACTORILY SELECTED AND HIS TRIP MARKED OUT FOR THE NEXT SIX WEEKS WHY HELLO CHARLIE OLD MAN
2007-149877-0031 HOW GOES IT THE ROOM WAS CROWDED DROUET SHOOK HANDS BEAMING GOOD NATURE AND THEY STROLLED TOWARDS THE BAR OH ALL RIGHT I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN SIX WEEKS WHEN DID YOU GET IN
2007-149877-0032 FRIDAY SAID DROUET HAD A FINE TRIP GLAD OF IT SAID HURSTWOOD HIS BLACK EYES LIT WITH A WARMTH WHICH HALF DISPLACED THE COLD MAKE BELIEVE THAT USUALLY DWELT IN THEM WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE HE ADDED AS THE BARKEEPER IN SNOWY JACKET AND TIE
2007-149877-0033 LEANED TOWARD THEM FROM BEHIND THE BAR OLD PEPPER SAID DROUET A LITTLE OF THE SAME FOR ME PUT IN HURSTWOOD HOW LONG ARE YOU IN TOWN THIS TIME INQUIRED HURSTWOOD ONLY UNTIL WEDNESDAY I'M GOING UP TO SAINT PAUL

2007-149877-0038 TO ONE NOT INCLINED TO DRINK AND GIFTED WITH A MORE SERIOUS TURN OF MIND SUCH A BUBBLING CHATTERING GLITTERING CHAMBER MUST EVER SEEM AN ANOMALY A STRANGE COMMENTARY ON NATURE AND LIFE
2007-149877-0039 HERE COME THE MOTHS IN ENDLESS PROCESSION TO BASK IN THE LIGHT OF THE FLAME SUCH CONVERSATION AS ONE MAY HEAR WOULD NOT WARRANT A COMMENDATION OF THE SCENE UPON INTELLECTUAL GROUNDS
2007-149877-0040 IT SEEMS PLAIN THAT SCHEMERS WOULD CHOOSE MORE SEQUESTERED QUARTERS TO ARRANGE THEIR PLANS THAT POLITICIANS WOULD NOT GATHER HERE IN COMPANY TO DISCUSS ANYTHING SAVE FORMALITIES WHERE THE SHARP EARED MAY HEAR AND IT WOULD SCARCELY BE JUSTIFIED ON THE SCORE OF THIRST
2007-149877-0041 NEVERTHELESS THE FACT THAT HERE MEN GATHER HERE CHATTER HERE LOVE TO PASS AND RUB ELBOWS MUST BE EXPLAINED UPON SOME GROUNDS IT MUST BE THAT A STRANGE BUNDLE OF PASSIONS AND VAGUE DESIRES
2007-149877-0042 THE MANY FRIENDS HE MET HERE DROPPED IN BECAUSE THEY CRAVED
2007-149877-0043 THE COMPANY THE GLOW THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH THEY FOUND ONE MIGHT TAKE IT AFTER ALL AS AN AUGUR OF THE BETTER SOCIAL ORDER FOR THE THINGS WHICH THEY SATISFIED HERE THOUGH SENSORY WERE NOT EVIL
2007-149877-0044 NO EVIL COULD COME OUT OF THE CONTEMPLATION OF AN EXPENSIVELY DECORATED CHAMBER THE WORST EFFECT OF SUCH A THING WOULD BE PERHAPS TO STIR UP IN THE MATERIAL MINDED AN AMBITION TO ARRANGE THEIR LIVES UPON A SIMILARLY SPLENDID BASIS
2007-149877-0045 IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THAT WOULD SCARCELY BE CALLED THE FAULT OF THE DECORATIONS BUT RATHER OF THE INNATE TREND OF THE MIND THAT SUCH A SCENE MIGHT STIR THE LESS EXPENSIVELY DRESSED TO EMULATE THE MORE EXPENSIVELY DRESSED
2007-149877-0046 COULD SCARCELY BE LAID AT THE DOOR OF ANYTHING SAVE THE FALSE AMBITION OF THE MINDS OF THOSE SO AFFECTED REMOVE THE ELEMENT SO THOROUGHLY AND SOLELY COMPLAINED OF LIQUOR
2007-149877-0047 AND THERE WOULD NOT BE ONE TO GAINSAY THE QUALITIES OF BEAUTY AND ENTHUSIASM WHICH WOULD REMAIN THE PLEASED EYE WITH WHICH OUR MODERN RESTAURANTS OF FASHION ARE LOOKED UPON IS PROOF OF THIS ASSERTION YET HERE IS THE FACT OF THE LIGHTED CHAMBER
2007-149877-0048 THE DRESSY GREEDY COMPANY THE SMALL SELF INTERESTED PALAVER THE DISORGANIZED AIMLESS WANDERING MENTAL ACTION WHICH IT REPRESENTS THE LOVE OF LIGHT AND SHOW AND FINERY WHICH TO ONE OUTSIDE
2007-149877-0049 UNDER THE SERENE LIGHT OF THE ETERNAL STARS MUST SEEM A STRANGE AND SHINY THING UNDER THE STARS AND SWEEPING NIGHT WINDS WHAT A LAMP FLOWER IT MUST BLOOM A

201-122255-0000 THEN UP GOT LITTLE JOHN AND TAKING THE BAG OF GOLD WHICH HE THRUST INTO HIS BOSOM
201-122255-0001 AND ON THE OTHER AS WELL LITTLE JOHN KNEW TO THE MERRY BLUE BOAR INN HERE LITTLE JOHN SUDDENLY CEASED WHISTLING AND STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH FIRST HE LOOKED UP AND THEN HE LOOKED DOWN AND THEN TILTING HIS CAP OVER ONE EYE HE SLOWLY SCRATCHED THE BACK PART OF HIS HEAD FOR THUS IT WAS
201-122255-0002 AT THE SIGHT OF THESE TWO ROADS TWO VOICES BEGAN TO ALARUM WITHIN HIM THE ONE CRYING THERE LIES THE ROAD TO THE BLUE BOAR INN A CAN OF BROWN OCTOBER AND A MERRY NIGHT WITH SWEET COMPANIONS SUCH AS THOU MAYST FIND THERE THE OTHER
201-122255-0003 LOOKING UP INTO THE BLUE SKY ACROSS WHICH BRIGHT CLOUDS WERE SAILING LIKE SILVER BOATS AND SWALLOWS SKIMMING IN CIRCLING FLIGHT QUOTH HE
201-122255-0004 FOR I KNOW MY GOOD MASTER WOULD NOT HAVE ME WET TO THE SKIN SO WITHOUT MORE ADO OFF HE STRODE DOWN THE PATH THAT LAY THE WAY OF HIS LIKINGS NOW THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY FOUL WEATHER BUT
201-122255-0005 FRESH CANS OF ALE WERE BROUGHT AND WITH JEST AND SONG AND MERRY TALES THE HOURS SLIPPED AWAY ON FLEETING WINGS NONE THOUGHT OF TIME OR TIDE TILL THE NIGHT WAS SO FAR GONE THAT LITTLE JOHN PUT BY THE THOUGHT OF SETTING FORTH UPON HIS JOURNEY AGAIN THAT NIGHT AND SO
201-122255-0006 BIDED AT THE BLUE BOAR INN UNTIL THE MORROW NOW IT WAS AN ILL PIECE OF LUCK FOR LITTLE JOHN THAT HE LEFT HIS DUTY FOR HIS PLEASURE AND HE PAID A GREAT SCORE FOR IT AS WE ARE ALL APT TO DO IN THE SAME CASE AS YOU SHALL SEE
201-122255-0007 AND TAKING HIS STOUT PIKESTAFF IN HIS HAND HE SET FORTH UPON HIS JOURNEY ONCE MORE AS THOUGH HE WOULD MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME IN THE GOOD TOWN OF BLYTH THERE LIVED A STOUT TANNER CELEBRATED FAR AND NEAR FOR FEATS OF STRENGTH AND MANY TOUGH BOUTS AT WRESTLING AND THE QUARTERSTAFF
201-122255-0008 BESIDES ALL THIS HE DEARLY LOVED THE LONGBOW
201-122255-0009 SO THAT THE KING'S RANGERS KEPT A SHREWD EYE UPON HIM AND HIS DOINGS FOR ARTHUR A BLAND'S HOUSE WAS APT TO HAVE APLENTY OF MEAT IN IT THAT WAS MORE LIKE VENISON THAN THE LAW ALLOWED NOW ARTHUR HAD BEEN TO NOTTINGHAM TOWN THE DAY BEFORE LITTLE JOHN SET FORTH ON HIS ERRAND
201-122255-0010 THERE TO SELL A HALFSCORE OF TANNED COWHIDES AT THE DAWN OF THE SAME DAY THAT LITTLE JOHN LEFT THE INN HE STARTED FROM NOTTINGHAM HOMEWARD FOR BLYTH HIS WAY LED ALL IN THE DEWY MORN PAST THE VERGE OF SHERWOOD FOREST WHERE THE BIRDS WERE WELCOMING THE LOVELY DAY WITH A GREAT AND MERRY JUBILEE
201-122255-0011 ACROSS THE TANNER'S SHOULDERS WAS SLUNG HIS STOUT QUARTERSTAFF EVER NEAR ENOUGH TO HIM TO BE GRIPPED QUICKLY AND ON HIS HEAD WAS A CAP OF DOUBLED COWHIDE SO TOUGH THAT IT COULD HARDLY BE CLOVEN EVEN BY A BROADSWORD NOW QUOTH ARTHUR A BLAND TO HIMSELF
201-122255-0012 MAYHAP I MAY CHANCE TO CATCH A SIGHT OF THE DAINTY BROWN DARLINGS THUS EARLY IN THE MORN FOR THERE WAS NOTHING HE LOVED BETTER THAN TO LOOK UPON A TRIPPING HERD OF DEER
201-122255-0013 ACCORDINGLY QUITTING THE PATH HE WENT PEEPING THIS WAY AND THAT THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH SPYING NOW HERE AND NOW THERE WITH ALL THE WILES OF A MASTER OF WOODCRAFT AND OF ONE WHO HAD MORE THAN ONCE DONNED A DOUBLET OF LINCOLN GREEN
201-122255-0014 THAT SPRINGING FROM THE DEWY GRASS HUNG ALOFT ON QUIVERING WINGS IN THE YELLOW SUNLIGHT POURING FORTH ITS SONG THAT FELL LIKE A FALLING STAR FROM THE SKY HIS LUCK LED HIM AWAY FROM THE HIGHWAY NOT FAR FROM THE SPOT WHERE ARTHUR A BLAND WAS PEEPING THIS WAY AND THAT THROUGH THE LEAVES OF THE THICKETS
201-122255-0015 HEARING A RUSTLING OF THE BRANCHES LITTLE JOHN STOPPED AND PRESENTLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE BROWN COWHIDE CAP OF THE TANNER MOVING AMONG THE BUSHES I DO MUCH WONDER
201-122255-0016 QUOTH LITTLE JOHN TO HIMSELF WHAT YON KNAVE IS AFTER THAT HE SHOULD GO THUS PEEPING AND PEERING ABOUT I VERILY BELIEVE THAT YON SCURVY VARLET IS NO BETTER THAN A THIEF AND COMETH HERE AFTER OUR OWN AND THE GOOD KING'S DUN DEER FOR
201-122255-0017 BY MUCH ROVING IN THE FOREST LITTLE JOHN HAD COME TO LOOK UPON ALL THE DEER IN SHERWOOD AS BELONGING TO ROBIN HOOD AND HIS BAND AS MUCH AS TO GOOD KING HARRY NAY
201-122255-0018 LITTLE JOHN TROD UPON A STICK WHICH SNAPPED UNDER HIS FOOT WHEREUPON HEARING THE NOISE THE TANNER TURNED QUICKLY AND CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE YEOMAN SEEING THAT THE TANNER HAD SPIED HIM OUT LITTLE JOHN PUT A BOLD FACE UPON THE MATTER
201-122255-0019 BUT AN HONEST CRAFTSMAN AS FOR MY COUNTENANCE IT IS WHAT IT IS AND FOR THE MATTER OF THAT THINE OWN IS NONE TOO PRETTY THOU SAUCY FELLOW HA QUOTH LITTLE JOHN IN A GREAT LOUD VOICE WOULDST THOU GIVE ME BACKTALK
201-122255-0020 I AND MY FRIENDS DO TAKE GOOD CARE OF OUR GOOD SOVEREIGN'S DEER I CARE NOT WHO THOU ART ANSWERED THE BOLD TANNER AND UNLESS THOU HAST MANY MORE OF THY KIND BY THEE THOU CANST NEVER MAKE ARTHUR A BLAND CRY A MERCY
201-122255-0021 FOR I WILL GIVE THEE SUCH A DRUBBING AS NE'ER HAST THOU HAD IN ALL THY LIFE BEFORE TAKE THY STAFF IN THY HAND FELLOW FOR I WILL NOT SMITE AN UNARMED MAN
201-122255-0022 FOR HE TOO HAD TALKED HIMSELF INTO A FUME BIG WORDS NE'ER KILLED SO MUCH AS A MOUSE WHO ART THOU THAT TALKEST SO FREELY OF CRACKING THE HEAD OF ARTHUR A BLAND IF I DO NOT TAN THY HIDE THIS DAY AS NE'ER I TANNED A CALF'S HIDE IN ALL MY LIFE BEFORE
201-122255-0023 NAY I PASS NOT FOR LENGTH ANSWERED THE TANNER MY STAFF IS LONG ENOUGH TO KNOCK DOWN A CALF SO LOOK TO THYSELF FELLOW I SAY AGAIN SO WITHOUT MORE ADO EACH GRIPPED HIS STAFF IN THE MIDDLE AND WITH FELL AND ANGRY LOOKS THEY CAME SLOWLY TOGETHER
201-122255-0024 NOW NEWS HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO ROBIN HOOD HOW THAT LITTLE JOHN INSTEAD OF DOING HIS BIDDING HAD PASSED BY DUTY FOR PLEASURE AND SO HAD STOPPED OVERNIGHT WITH MERRY COMPANY AT THE BLUE BOAR INN INSTEAD OF GOING STRAIGHT TO ANCASTER
201-122255-0025 SO BEING VEXED TO HIS HEART BY THIS HE SET FORTH AT DAWN OF DAY TO SEEK LITTLE JOHN AT THE BLUE BOAR OR AT LEAST TO MEET THE YEOMAN ON THE WAY AND EASE HIS HEART OF WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE MATTER
201-122255-0026 AS THUS HE STRODE ALONG IN ANGER PUTTING TOGETHER THE WORDS HE WOULD USE TO CHIDE LITTLE JOHN HE HEARD OF A SUDDEN LOUD AND ANGRY VOICES
201-122255-0027 AT THIS ROBIN HOOD STOPPED AND LISTENED SURELY QUOTH HE TO HIMSELF THAT IS LITTLE JOHN'S VOICE AND HE IS TALKING IN ANGER ALSO METHINKS THE OTHER IS STRANGE TO MY EARS
201-122255-0028 NOW HEAVEN FORFEND THAT MY GOOD TRUSTY LITTLE JOHN SHOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE KING'S RANGERS I MUST SEE TO THIS MATTER AND THAT QUICKLY THUS SPOKE ROBIN HOOD TO HIMSELF ALL HIS ANGER PASSING AWAY LIKE A BREATH FROM THE WINDOWPANE
201-122255-0029 AT THE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HIS TRUSTY RIGHT HAND MAN WAS IN SOME DANGER OF HIS LIFE SO CAUTIOUSLY
201-122255-0030 HA QUOTH ROBIN TO HIMSELF HERE IS MERRY SPORT AFOOT NOW I WOULD GIVE THREE GOLDEN ANGELS FROM MY OWN POCKET IF YON STOUT FELLOW WOULD GIVE LITTLE JOHN A RIGHT SOUND DRUBBING IT WOULD PLEASE ME TO SEE HIM WELL THUMPED FOR HAVING FAILED IN MY BIDDING
201-122255-0031 I FEAR ME THOUGH THERE IS BUT POOR CHANCE OF MY SEEING SUCH A PLEASANT SIGHT SO SAYING HE STRETCHED HIMSELF AT LENGTH UPON THE GROUND THAT HE MIGHT NOT ONLY SEE THE SPORT THE BETTER BUT THAT HE MIGHT ENJOY THE MERRY SIGHT AT HIS EASE
201-122255-0032 EACH WATCHING FOR A CHANCE TO TAKE THE OTHER UNAWARE AND SO GET IN THE FIRST BLOW AT LAST LITTLE JOHN STRUCK LIKE A FLASH AND RAP THE TANNER MET THE BLOW AND TURNED IT ASIDE AND THEN SMOTE BACK AT LITTLE JOHN WHO ALSO TURNED THE BLOW AND SO THIS MIGHTY BATTLE BEGAN
201-122255-0033 NEVER HAD I THOUGHT TO SEE LITTLE JOHN SO EVENLY MATCHED IN ALL MY LIFE BELIKE THOUGH
201-122255-0034 HIS CUDGEL FLYING FROM HIS HAND AS HE FELL THEN RAISING HIS STAFF STOUT ARTHUR DEALT HIM ANOTHER BLOW UPON THE RIBS HOLD ROARED LITTLE JOHN
201-122255-0035 HAST THOU HAD ENOUGH ASKED THE TANNER GRIMLY HOLDING HIS STAFF ALOFT AY MARRY AND MORE THAN ENOUGH AND THOU DOST OWN THAT I AM THE BETTER MAN OF THE TWO YEA TRULY AND A MURRAIN SEIZE THEE
201-122255-0036 SAID LITTLE JOHN SITTING UP AND FEELING HIS RIBS WHERE THE TANNER HAD CUDGELED HIM I MAKE MY VOW MY RIBS FEEL AS THOUGH EVERY ONE OF THEM WERE BROKEN IN TWAIN
201-122255-0037 I DID THINK THERE WAS NEVER A MAN IN ALL NOTTINGHAMSHIRE COULD DO TO ME WHAT THOU HAST DONE THIS DAY AND SO THOUGHT I ALSO CRIED ROBIN HOOD BURSTING OUT OF THE THICKET AND SHOUTING WITH LAUGHTER TILL THE TEARS RAN DOWN HIS CHEEKS
201-122255-0038 HAND AND FOOT TO ANY MAN IN ALL MERRY ENGLAND I WAS SEEKING THEE TO CHIDE THEE FOR LEAVING MY BIDDING UNDONE BUT THOU HAST BEEN PAID ALL I OWED THEE
201-122255-0039 MARRY A DID REACH OUT HIS ARM FULL LENGTH WHILE THOU STOOD GAPING AT HIM AND WITH A PRETTY RAP TUMBLED THEE OVER AS NEVER HAVE I SEEN ONE TUMBLED BEFORE SO SPOKE BOLD ROBIN
201-122255-0040 AND NOW WHAT MAY BE THY NAME HA ARTHUR A BLAND QUOTH ROBIN I HAVE HEARD THY NAME BEFORE GOOD FELLOW THOU DIDST BREAK THE CROWN OF A FRIEND OF MINE AT THE FAIR AT ELY LAST OCTOBER THE FOLK THERE CALL HIM JOCK O NOTTINGHAM WE CALL HIM WILL SCATHELOCK
201-122255-0041 THIS POOR FELLOW WHOM THOU HAST SO BELABORED IS COUNTED THE BEST HAND AT THE QUARTERSTAFF IN ALL MERRY ENGLAND HIS NAME IS LITTLE JOHN AND MINE ROBIN HOOD
201-122255-0042 NAY QUOTH LITTLE JOHN TESTILY AT THE SAME TIME RISING CAREFULLY AS THOUGH HIS BONES HAD BEEN MADE OF GLASS I CAN HELP MYSELF GOOD FELLOW WITHOUT THY AID AND LET ME TELL THEE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THAT VILE COWSKIN CAP OF THINE
201-122255-0043 I WILL FOLLOW THEE TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH GOOD MASTER AND NOT A HERD OF DUN DEER IN ALL THE FOREST BUT SHALL KNOW THE SOUND OF THE TWANG OF MY BOWSTRING AS FOR THEE LITTLE JOHN SAID ROBIN TURNING TO HIM AND LAUGHING
201-122255-0044 THERE ARE OTHER INNS THAT THOU KNOWEST YET HEREABOUTS
201-127786-0000 HAPPY AND FORTUNATE WERE THE TIMES WHEN THAT MOST DARING KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WAS SENT INTO THE WORLD
201-127786-0001 BUT ALSO OF THE TALES AND EPISODES CONTAINED IN IT WHICH ARE IN A MEASURE NO LESS PLEASING INGENIOUS AND TRUTHFUL THAN THE HISTORY ITSELF WHICH RESUMING ITS THREAD CARDED SPUN AND WOUND RELATES THAT JUST AS THE CURATE WAS GOING TO OFFER CONSOLATION TO CARDENIO
201-127786-0002 ALL THIS WAS HEARD DISTINCTLY BY THE CURATE AND THOSE WITH HIM AND AS IT SEEMED TO THEM TO BE UTTERED CLOSE BY AS INDEED IT WAS THEY GOT UP TO LOOK FOR THE SPEAKER AND BEFORE THEY HAD GONE TWENTY PACES THEY DISCOVERED BEHIND A ROCK SEATED AT THE FOOT OF AN ASH TREE
201-127786-0003 A YOUTH IN THE DRESS OF A PEASANT WHOSE FACE THEY WERE UNABLE AT THE MOMENT TO SEE AS HE WAS LEANING FORWARD BATHING HIS FEET IN THE BROOK THAT FLOWED PAST THEY APPROACHED SO SILENTLY THAT HE DID NOT PERCEIVE THEM BEING FULLY OCCUPIED IN BATHING HIS FEET
201-127786-0004 CRUSH CLODS OR TO FOLLOW THE PLOUGH AND THE OXEN AS THEIR OWNER'S DRESS SUGGESTED AND SO FINDING THEY HAD NOT BEEN NOTICED THE CURATE WHO WAS IN FRONT MADE A SIGN TO THE OTHER TWO TO CONCEAL THEMSELVES BEHIND SOME FRAGMENTS OF ROCK THAT LAY THERE
201-127786-0005 WHICH THEY DID OBSERVING CLOSELY WHAT THE YOUTH WAS ABOUT HE HAD ON A LOOSE DOUBLE SKIRTED DARK BROWN JACKET BOUND TIGHT TO HIS BODY WITH A WHITE CLOTH HE WORE BESIDES BREECHES AND GAITERS OF BROWN CLOTH AND ON HIS HEAD A BROWN MONTERA AND
201-127786-0006 AS THIS IS NOT LUSCINDA IT IS NO HUMAN CREATURE BUT A DIVINE BEING THE YOUTH THEN TOOK OFF THE MONTERA AND SHAKING HIS HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE THERE BROKE LOOSE AND SPREAD OUT A MASS OF HAIR THAT THE BEAMS OF THE SUN MIGHT HAVE ENVIED
201-127786-0007 BY THIS THEY KNEW THAT WHAT HAD SEEMED A PEASANT WAS A LOVELY WOMAN NAY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THE EYES OF TWO OF THEM HAD EVER BEHELD OR EVEN CARDENIO'S IF THEY HAD NOT SEEN AND KNOWN LUSCINDA
201-127786-0008 THE LONG AUBURN TRESSES NOT ONLY COVERED HER SHOULDERS BUT SUCH WAS THEIR LENGTH AND ABUNDANCE CONCEALED HER ALL ROUND BENEATH THEIR MASSES SO THAT EXCEPT THE FEET NOTHING OF HER FORM WAS VISIBLE SHE NOW USED HER HANDS AS A COMB
201-127786-0009 AND IF HER FEET HAD SEEMED LIKE BITS OF CRYSTAL IN THE WATER HER HANDS LOOKED LIKE PIECES OF DRIVEN SNOW AMONG HER LOCKS ALL WHICH INCREASED NOT ONLY THE ADMIRATION OF THE THREE BEHOLDERS BUT THEIR ANXIETY TO LEARN WHO SHE WAS WITH THIS OBJECT THEY RESOLVED TO SHOW THEMSELVES
201-127786-0010 HER DELICATE FEET BEING UNABLE TO BEAR THE ROUGHNESS OF THE STONES SEEING WHICH THE THREE HASTENED TOWARDS HER AND THE CURATE ADDRESSING HER FIRST SAID STAY SENORA WHOEVER YOU MAY BE FOR THOSE WHOM YOU SEE HERE ONLY DESIRE TO BE OF SERVICE TO YOU
201-127786-0011 YOU HAVE NO NEED TO ATTEMPT A FLIGHT SO HEEDLESS FOR NEITHER CAN YOUR FEET BEAR IT NOR WE ALLOW IT TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND BEWILDERED SHE MADE NO REPLY TO THESE WORDS THEY HOWEVER CAME TOWARDS HER AND THE CURATE TAKING HER HAND WENT ON TO SAY
201-127786-0012 WHAT YOUR DRESS WOULD HIDE SENORA IS MADE KNOWN TO US BY YOUR HAIR A CLEAR PROOF THAT IT CAN BE NO TRIFLING CAUSE THAT HAS DISGUISED YOUR BEAUTY IN A GARB SO UNWORTHY OF IT AND SENT IT INTO SOLITUDES LIKE THESE WHERE WE HAVE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO FIND YOU
201-127786-0013 IF NOT TO RELIEVE YOUR DISTRESS AT LEAST TO OFFER YOU COMFORT FOR NO DISTRESS SO LONG AS LIFE LASTS CAN BE SO OPPRESSIVE OR REACH SUCH A HEIGHT AS TO MAKE THE SUFFERER REFUSE TO LISTEN TO COMFORT OFFERED WITH GOOD INTENTION AND SO SENORA
201-127786-0014 BUT ON THE CURATE ADDRESSING SOME FURTHER WORDS TO THE SAME EFFECT TO HER SIGHING DEEPLY SHE BROKE SILENCE AND SAID SINCE THE SOLITUDE OF THESE MOUNTAINS HAS BEEN UNABLE TO CONCEAL ME AND THE ESCAPE OF MY DISHEVELLED TRESSES WILL NOT ALLOW MY TONGUE TO DEAL IN FALSEHOODS
201-127786-0015 IT WOULD BE IDLE FOR ME NOW TO MAKE ANY FURTHER PRETENCE OF WHAT IF YOU WERE TO BELIEVE ME YOU WOULD BELIEVE MORE OUT OF COURTESY THAN FOR ANY OTHER REASON
201-127786-0016 THIS BEING SO I SAY I THANK YOU SIRS FOR THE OFFER YOU HAVE MADE ME WHICH PLACES ME UNDER THE OBLIGATION OF COMPLYING WITH THE REQUEST YOU HAVE MADE OF ME THOUGH I FEAR THE ACCOUNT I SHALL GIVE YOU OF MY MISFORTUNES WILL EXCITE IN YOU AS MUCH CONCERN AS COMPASSION
201-127786-0017 FOR YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SUGGEST ANYTHING TO REMEDY THEM OR ANY CONSOLATION TO ALLEVIATE THEM HOWEVER THAT MY HONOUR MAY NOT BE LEFT A MATTER OF DOUBT IN YOUR MINDS NOW THAT YOU HAVE DISCOVERED ME TO BE A WOMAN
201-127786-0018 I FEEL BOUND TO TELL WHAT I WOULD WILLINGLY KEEP SECRET IF I COULD ALL THIS SHE WHO WAS NOW SEEN TO BE A LOVELY WOMAN DELIVERED WITHOUT ANY HESITATION WITH SO MUCH EASE AND IN SO SWEET A VOICE THAT THEY WERE NOT LESS CHARMED BY HER INTELLIGENCE THAN BY HER BEAUTY
201-127786-0019 AND AS THEY AGAIN REPEATED THEIR OFFERS AND ENTREATIES TO HER TO FULFIL HER PROMISE SHE WITHOUT FURTHER PRESSING FIRST MODESTLY COVERING HER FEET AND GATHERING UP HER HAIR SEATED HERSELF ON A STONE WITH THE THREE PLACED AROUND HER AND
201-127786-0020 AFTER AN EFFORT TO RESTRAIN SOME TEARS THAT CAME TO HER EYES IN A CLEAR AND STEADY VOICE BEGAN HER STORY THUS
201-127786-0021 LOWLY IN ORIGIN BUT SO WEALTHY THAT IF BIRTH HAD CONFERRED AS MUCH ON THEM AS FORTUNE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD NOTHING LEFT TO DESIRE NOR SHOULD I HAVE HAD REASON TO FEAR TROUBLE LIKE THAT IN WHICH I FIND MYSELF NOW
201-127786-0022 FOR IT MAY BE THAT MY ILL FORTUNE CAME OF THEIRS IN NOT HAVING BEEN NOBLY BORN IT IS TRUE THEY ARE NOT SO LOW THAT THEY HAVE ANY REASON TO BE ASHAMED OF THEIR CONDITION
201-127786-0023 THEY ARE IN SHORT PEASANTS
201-127786-0024 AND AS THE SAYING IS OLD RUSTY CHRISTIANS BUT SO RICH THAT BY THEIR WEALTH AND FREE HANDED WAY OF LIFE THEY ARE COMING BY DEGREES TO BE CONSIDERED GENTLEFOLK BY BIRTH AND EVEN BY POSITION
201-127786-0025 AND AS THEY HAVE NO OTHER CHILD TO MAKE THEIR HEIR AND ARE AFFECTIONATE PARENTS I WAS ONE OF THE MOST INDULGED DAUGHTERS THAT EVER PARENTS INDULGED
201-127786-0026 ALL THEIR WISHES CENTRED AND MINE WERE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIRS FOR I KNEW THEIR WORTH AND AS I WAS MISTRESS OF THEIR HEARTS SO WAS I ALSO OF THEIR POSSESSIONS THROUGH ME THEY ENGAGED OR DISMISSED THEIR SERVANTS
201-127786-0027 THROUGH MY HANDS PASSED THE ACCOUNTS AND RETURNS OF WHAT WAS SOWN AND REAPED THE OIL MILLS THE WINE PRESSES THE COUNT OF THE FLOCKS AND HERDS THE BEEHIVES ALL IN SHORT THAT A RICH FARMER LIKE MY FATHER HAS OR CAN HAVE I HAD UNDER MY CARE
201-127786-0028 FOR EXPERIENCE TAUGHT ME THAT MUSIC SOOTHES THE TROUBLED MIND AND RELIEVES WEARINESS OF SPIRIT SUCH WAS THE LIFE I LED IN MY PARENTS HOUSE AND IF I HAVE DEPICTED IT THUS MINUTELY IT IS NOT OUT OF OSTENTATION OR TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I AM RICH BUT
201-127786-0029 AND UNSEEN AS I THOUGHT BY ANY EXCEPT THE SERVANTS OF THE HOUSE FOR WHEN I WENT TO MASS IT WAS SO EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I WAS SO CLOSELY ATTENDED BY MY MOTHER AND THE WOMEN OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND
201-127786-0030 FOR THAT IS THE NAME OF THE YOUNGER SON OF THE DUKE I TOLD OF THE MOMENT THE SPEAKER MENTIONED THE NAME OF DON FERNANDO
201-127786-0031 FOR HE BEGAN TO SUSPECT WHO SHE WAS SHE HOWEVER WITHOUT NOTICING THE EXCITEMENT OF CARDENIO CONTINUING HER STORY WENT ON TO SAY
201-127786-0032 AND I WAS NOT DISPLEASED AT SEEING MY PRAISES IN HIS LETTERS FOR HOWEVER UGLY WE WOMEN MAY BE IT SEEMS TO ME IT ALWAYS PLEASES US TO HEAR OURSELVES CALLED BEAUTIFUL BUT THAT MY OWN SENSE OF RIGHT WAS OPPOSED TO ALL THIS
201-127786-0033 AS WELL AS THE REPEATED ADVICE OF MY PARENTS WHO NOW VERY PLAINLY PERCEIVED DON FERNANDO'S PURPOSE FOR HE CARED VERY LITTLE IF ALL THE WORLD KNEW IT THEY TOLD ME THEY TRUSTED AND CONFIDED THEIR HONOUR AND GOOD NAME TO MY VIRTUE
201-127786-0034 AND RECTITUDE ALONE AND BADE ME CONSIDER THE DISPARITY BETWEEN DON FERNANDO AND MYSELF FROM WHICH I MIGHT CONCLUDE THAT HIS INTENTIONS WHATEVER HE MIGHT SAY TO THE CONTRARY HAD FOR THEIR AIM HIS OWN PLEASURE RATHER THAN MY ADVANTAGE
201-127786-0035 AND IF I WERE AT ALL DESIROUS OF OPPOSING AN OBSTACLE TO HIS UNREASONABLE SUIT THEY WERE READY THEY SAID TO MARRY ME AT ONCE TO ANYONE I PREFERRED EITHER AMONG THE LEADING PEOPLE OF OUR OWN TOWN OR
201-127786-0036 AND I NEVER GAVE DON FERNANDO A WORD IN REPLY THAT COULD HOLD OUT TO HIM ANY HOPE OF SUCCESS HOWEVER REMOTE ALL THIS CAUTION OF MINE WHICH HE MUST HAVE TAKEN FOR COYNESS HAD APPARENTLY THE EFFECT OF INCREASING HIS WANTON APPETITE FOR
201-127786-0037 OR AT LEAST TO SECURE ADDITIONAL PROTECTORS TO WATCH OVER ME AND THIS INTELLIGENCE OR SUSPICION MADE HIM ACT AS YOU SHALL HEAR ONE NIGHT AS I WAS IN MY CHAMBER WITH NO OTHER COMPANION THAN A DAMSEL WHO WAITED ON ME WITH
201-127786-0038 I HAD NO POWER TO UTTER A CRY NOR I THINK DID HE GIVE ME TIME TO UTTER ONE AS HE IMMEDIATELY APPROACHED ME AND TAKING ME IN HIS ARMS FOR OVERWHELMED AS I WAS I WAS POWERLESS I SAY TO HELP MYSELF HE BEGAN TO MAKE SUCH
201-127786-0039 PROFESSIONS TO ME THAT I KNOW NOT HOW FALSEHOOD COULD HAVE HAD THE POWER OF DRESSING THEM UP TO SEEM SO LIKE TRUTH AND THE TRAITOR CONTRIVED THAT HIS TEARS SHOULD VOUCH FOR HIS WORDS AND HIS SIGHS FOR HIS SINCERITY
201-127786-0040 AND I BEGAN IN SOME DEGREE TO RECOVER MYSELF I SAID TO HIM WITH MORE COURAGE THAN I THOUGHT I COULD HAVE POSSESSED
201-127786-0041 I HAVE MY SELF RESPECT AS MUCH AS YOU A LORD AND GENTLEMAN WITH ME YOUR VIOLENCE WILL BE TO NO PURPOSE YOUR WEALTH WILL HAVE NO WEIGHT YOUR WORDS WILL HAVE NO POWER TO DECEIVE ME NOR YOUR SIGHS OR TEARS TO SOFTEN ME
201-127786-0042 WERE I TO SEE ANY OF THE THINGS I SPEAK OF IN HIM WHOM MY PARENTS GAVE ME AS A HUSBAND HIS WILL SHOULD BE MINE AND MINE SHOULD BE BOUNDED BY HIS AND MY HONOUR BEING PRESERVED EVEN THOUGH MY INCLINATIONS WERE NOT
201-127786-0043 AND THIS I SAY LEST YOU SHOULD SUPPOSE THAT ANY BUT MY LAWFUL HUSBAND SHALL EVER WIN ANYTHING OF ME IF THAT
201-127786-0044 BE THE ONLY SCRUPLE YOU FEEL FAIREST DOROTHEA FOR THAT IS THE NAME OF THIS UNHAPPY BEING SEE HERE I GIVE YOU MY HAND TO BE YOURS AND LET HEAVEN
201-127786-0045 BUT HE WAS UNWILLING TO INTERRUPT THE STORY AND WISHED TO HEAR THE END OF WHAT HE ALREADY ALL BUT KNEW SO HE MERELY SAID WHAT
201-127786-0046 I HAVE HEARD OF ANOTHER OF THE SAME NAME WHO CAN PERHAPS MATCH YOUR MISFORTUNES BUT PROCEED BY AND BY I MAY TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT WILL ASTONISH YOU AS MUCH AS IT WILL EXCITE YOUR COMPASSION DOROTHEA WAS STRUCK BY CARDENIO'S WORDS AS WELL AS BY HIS STRANGE AND MISERABLE ATTIRE
201-127786-0047 AND BEGGED HIM IF HE KNEW ANYTHING CONCERNING HER TO TELL IT TO HER AT ONCE FOR IF FORTUNE HAD LEFT HER ANY BLESSING IT WAS COURAGE TO BEAR WHATEVER CALAMITY MIGHT FALL UPON HER AS SHE FELT SURE THAT NONE COULD REACH HER CAPABLE OF INCREASING IN ANY DEGREE WHAT SHE ENDURED ALREADY
201-127786-0048 I WOULD NOT LET THE OCCASION PASS SENORA REPLIED CARDENIO OF TELLING YOU WHAT I THINK
201-127786-0049 AND ONE OF HIS VASSALS I TOLD HIM NOT TO LET MY BEAUTY SUCH AS IT WAS BLIND HIM
201-127786-0050 FOR MARRIAGES SO UNEQUAL NEVER BROUGHT HAPPINESS NOR DID THEY CONTINUE LONG TO AFFORD THE ENJOYMENT THEY BEGAN WITH ALL THIS THAT I HAVE NOW REPEATED I SAID TO HIM AND MUCH MORE WHICH I CANNOT RECOLLECT BUT IT HAD NO EFFECT IN INDUCING HIM TO FOREGO HIS PURPOSE
201-127786-0051 AT THE SAME TIME I ARGUED THE MATTER BRIEFLY IN MY OWN MIND SAYING TO MYSELF I SHALL NOT BE THE FIRST WHO HAS RISEN THROUGH MARRIAGE FROM A LOWLY TO A LOFTY STATION NOR WILL DON FERNANDO BE THE FIRST WHOM BEAUTY OR AS IS MORE LIKELY A BLIND ATTACHMENT
201-127786-0052 HAS LED TO MATE HIMSELF BELOW HIS RANK THEN SINCE I AM INTRODUCING NO NEW USAGE OR PRACTICE
201-127786-0053 PASSED THROUGH MY MIND IN A MOMENT BUT THE OATHS OF DON FERNANDO THE WITNESSES HE APPEALED TO THE TEARS HE SHED AND LASTLY THE CHARMS OF HIS PERSON AND HIS HIGH BRED GRACE WHICH ACCOMPANIED BY SUCH SIGNS OF GENUINE LOVE
201-127786-0054 THESE WERE THE THINGS THAT MORE THAN ALL BEGAN TO INFLUENCE ME AND LEAD ME UNAWARES TO MY RUIN I CALLED MY WAITING MAID TO ME THAT THERE MIGHT BE A WITNESS ON EARTH BESIDES THOSE IN HEAVEN AND AGAIN DON FERNANDO RENEWED AND REPEATED HIS OATHS
201-127786-0055 CALLED DOWN UPON HIMSELF A THOUSAND CURSES HEREAFTER SHOULD HE FAIL TO KEEP HIS PROMISE SHED MORE TEARS REDOUBLED HIS SIGHS
201-127786-0056 AND SO I WAS LEFT BY MY MAID AND CEASED TO BE ONE AND HE BECAME A TRAITOR AND A PERJURED MAN THE DAY WHICH FOLLOWED THE NIGHT OF MY MISFORTUNE DID NOT COME SO QUICKLY I IMAGINE AS DON FERNANDO WISHED
201-127786-0057 WHO WAS INDEED THE ONE WHO HAD ADMITTED HIM GAINED THE STREET BEFORE DAYBREAK BUT ON TAKING LEAVE OF ME HE TOLD ME THOUGH NOT WITH AS MUCH EARNESTNESS AND FERVOUR AS WHEN HE CAME THAT I MIGHT REST ASSURED OF HIS FAITH AND OF THE SANCTITY AND SINCERITY OF HIS OATHS
201-127786-0058 AND TO CONFIRM HIS WORDS HE DREW A RICH RING OFF HIS FINGER AND PLACED IT UPON MINE HE THEN TOOK HIS DEPARTURE AND I WAS LEFT I KNOW NOT WHETHER SORROWFUL OR HAPPY ALL I CAN SAY IS I WAS LEFT AGITATED AND TROUBLED IN MIND AND ALMOST BEWILDERED BY WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE
201-127786-0059 AND I HAD NOT THE SPIRIT OR ELSE IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ME TO CHIDE MY MAID FOR THE TREACHERY SHE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF IN CONCEALING DON FERNANDO IN MY CHAMBER FOR AS YET I WAS UNABLE TO MAKE UP MY MIND WHETHER WHAT HAD BEFALLEN ME WAS FOR GOOD OR EVIL
201-127786-0060 I TOLD DON FERNANDO AT PARTING THAT AS I WAS NOW HIS HE MIGHT SEE ME ON OTHER NIGHTS IN THE SAME WAY UNTIL IT SHOULD BE HIS PLEASURE TO LET THE MATTER BECOME KNOWN BUT EXCEPT THE FOLLOWING NIGHT HE CAME NO MORE NOR FOR MORE THAN A MONTH COULD I CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HIM IN THE STREET OR IN CHURCH
201-127786-0061 WHILE I WEARIED MYSELF WITH WATCHING FOR ONE
201-127786-0062 I REMEMBER TOO HOW MY MAID HEARD THOSE WORDS IN REPROOF OF HER AUDACITY THAT SHE HAD NOT HEARD BEFORE AND HOW I WAS FORCED TO PUT A CONSTRAINT ON MY TEARS AND ON THE EXPRESSION OF MY COUNTENANCE NOT TO GIVE MY PARENTS CAUSE TO ASK ME WHY I WAS SO MELANCHOLY
201-127786-0063 AND DRIVE ME TO INVENT FALSEHOODS IN REPLY BUT ALL THIS WAS SUDDENLY BROUGHT TO AN END FOR THE TIME CAME WHEN ALL SUCH CONSIDERATIONS WERE DISREGARDED AND THERE WAS NO FURTHER QUESTION OF HONOUR WHEN MY PATIENCE GAVE WAY AND THE SECRET OF MY HEART BECAME KNOWN ABROAD
201-127786-0064 IT WAS SAID TOO THAT HER NAME WAS LUSCINDA AND THAT AT THE BETROTHAL SOME STRANGE THINGS HAD HAPPENED
201-127786-0065 DOROTHEA HOWEVER DID NOT INTERRUPT HER STORY BUT WENT ON IN THESE WORDS THIS SAD INTELLIGENCE REACHED MY EARS
201-127786-0066 AND WHOM I ENTREATED TO ACCOMPANY ME TO THE CITY WHERE I HEARD MY ENEMY WAS
201-127786-0067 AN AFFAIR OF SUCH NOTORIETY IN THE CITY THAT IT WAS THE TALK OF EVERY KNOT OF IDLERS IN THE STREET HE SAID THAT ON THE NIGHT OF DON FERNANDO'S BETROTHAL WITH LUSCINDA AS SOON AS SHE HAD CONSENTED TO BE HIS BRIDE BY SAYING YES SHE WAS TAKEN WITH A SUDDEN FAINTING FIT
201-127786-0068 AND THAT ON THE BRIDEGROOM APPROACHING TO UNLACE THE BOSOM OF HER DRESS TO GIVE HER AIR
201-127786-0069 ON SEEING THIS DON FERNANDO PERSUADED THAT LUSCINDA HAD BEFOOLED SLIGHTED AND TRIFLED WITH HIM ASSAILED HER BEFORE SHE HAD RECOVERED FROM HER SWOON AND TRIED TO STAB HER WITH THE DAGGER THAT HAD BEEN FOUND AND WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED HAD NOT HER PARENTS AND THOSE WHO WERE PRESENT PREVENTED HIM
201-127786-0070 IT WAS SAID MOREOVER THAT DON FERNANDO WENT AWAY AT ONCE AND THAT LUSCINDA DID NOT RECOVER FROM HER PROSTRATION UNTIL THE NEXT DAY WHEN SHE TOLD HER PARENTS HOW SHE WAS REALLY THE BRIDE OF THAT CARDENIO I HAVE MENTIONED I LEARNED BESIDES THAT CARDENIO
201-127786-0071 ACCORDING TO REPORT HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE BETROTHAL AND THAT UPON SEEING HER BETROTHED CONTRARY TO HIS EXPECTATION HE HAD QUITTED THE CITY IN DESPAIR LEAVING BEHIND HIM A LETTER DECLARING THE WRONG LUSCINDA HAD DONE HIM AND HIS INTENTION OF GOING WHERE NO ONE SHOULD EVER SEE HIM AGAIN
201-127786-0072 ALL THIS WAS A MATTER OF NOTORIETY IN THE CITY AND EVERYONE SPOKE OF IT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT LUSCINDA WAS MISSING FROM HER FATHER'S HOUSE AND FROM THE CITY FOR SHE WAS NOT TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE TO THE DISTRACTION OF HER PARENTS WHO KNEW NOT WHAT STEPS TO TAKE TO RECOVER HER WHAT I LEARNED
201-127786-0073 REVIVED MY HOPES AND I WAS BETTER PLEASED NOT TO HAVE FOUND DON FERNANDO THAN TO FIND HIM MARRIED FOR IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE DOOR WAS NOT YET ENTIRELY SHUT UPON RELIEF IN MY CASE AND I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HEAVEN HAD PUT THIS IMPEDIMENT IN THE WAY OF THE SECOND MARRIAGE
201-127786-0074 TO LEAD HIM TO RECOGNISE HIS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FORMER ONE AND REFLECT THAT AS A CHRISTIAN HE WAS BOUND TO CONSIDER HIS SOUL ABOVE ALL HUMAN OBJECTS ALL THIS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND AND I STROVE TO COMFORT MYSELF WITHOUT COMFORT
201-127786-0075 INDULGING IN FAINT AND DISTANT HOPES OF CHERISHING THAT LIFE THAT I NOW ABHOR BUT WHILE I WAS IN THE CITY UNCERTAIN WHAT TO DO AS I COULD NOT FIND DON FERNANDO I HEARD NOTICE GIVEN BY THE PUBLIC CRIER OFFERING A GREAT REWARD TO ANYONE WHO SHOULD FIND ME
201-127786-0076 AND GIVING THE PARTICULARS OF MY AGE AND OF THE VERY DRESS I WORE AND I HEARD IT SAID THAT THE LAD WHO CAME WITH ME HAD TAKEN ME AWAY FROM MY FATHER'S HOUSE A THING THAT CUT ME TO THE HEART SHOWING HOW LOW MY GOOD NAME HAD FALLEN SINCE IT WAS NOT ENOUGH THAT I SHOULD LOSE IT BY MY FLIGHT
201-127786-0077 BUT THEY MUST ADD WITH WHOM I HAD FLED AND THAT ONE SO MUCH BENEATH ME AND SO UNWORTHY OF MY CONSIDERATION THE INSTANT I HEARD THE NOTICE I QUITTED THE CITY WITH MY SERVANT WHO NOW BEGAN TO SHOW SIGNS OF WAVERING IN HIS FIDELITY TO ME AND THE SAME NIGHT FOR FEAR OF DISCOVERY
201-127786-0078 HE LAID ASIDE THE ENTREATIES WHICH HE HAD EMPLOYED AT FIRST AND BEGAN TO USE VIOLENCE BUT JUST HEAVEN THAT SELDOM FAILS TO WATCH OVER AND AID GOOD INTENTIONS SO AIDED MINE THAT WITH MY SLIGHT STRENGTH AND WITH LITTLE EXERTION
201-127786-0079 I PUSHED HIM OVER A PRECIPICE WHERE I LEFT HIM WHETHER DEAD OR ALIVE I KNOW NOT AND THEN WITH GREATER SPEED THAN SEEMED POSSIBLE IN MY TERROR AND FATIGUE I MADE MY WAY INTO THE MOUNTAINS WITHOUT ANY OTHER THOUGHT OR PURPOSE SAVE THAT OF HIDING MYSELF AMONG THEM AND ESCAPING MY FATHER
201-127786-0080 AND THOSE DESPATCHED IN SEARCH OF ME BY HIS ORDERS IT IS NOW I KNOW NOT HOW MANY MONTHS SINCE WITH THIS OBJECT I CAME HERE WHERE I MET A HERDSMAN WHO ENGAGED ME AS HIS SERVANT AT A PLACE IN THE HEART OF THIS SIERRA
201-127786-0081 BUT ALL MY CARE AND PAINS WERE UNAVAILING FOR MY MASTER MADE THE DISCOVERY THAT I WAS NOT A MAN AND HARBOURED THE SAME BASE DESIGNS AS MY SERVANT
2092-145706-0000 KLETKE THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME A MAN AND WOMAN WHO HAD THREE FINE LOOKING SONS BUT THEY WERE SO POOR THAT THEY HAD HARDLY ENOUGH FOOD FOR THEMSELVES LET ALONE THEIR CHILDREN
2092-145706-0001 OF HER AND THEIR FATHER THE THREE SET FORTH ON THEIR TRAVELS THE YOUNGEST OF THE THREE BROTHERS WHOSE NAME WAS FERKO WAS A BEAUTIFUL YOUTH WITH A SPLENDID FIGURE BLUE EYES FAIR HAIR
2092-145706-0002 AND A COMPLEXION LIKE MILK AND ROSES HIS TWO BROTHERS WERE AS JEALOUS OF HIM AS THEY COULD BE FOR THEY THOUGHT THAT WITH HIS GOOD LOOKS HE WOULD BE SURE TO BE MORE FORTUNATE THAN THEY WOULD EVER BE
2092-145706-0003 FOR THE SUN WAS HOT AND THEY WERE TIRED OF WALKING FERKO FELL FAST ASLEEP BUT THE OTHER TWO REMAINED AWAKE AND THE ELDEST SAID TO THE SECOND BROTHER WHAT DO YOU SAY TO DOING OUR BROTHER FERKO SOME HARM
2092-145706-0004 HE IS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT EVERYONE TAKES A FANCY TO HIM WHICH IS MORE THAN THEY DO TO US IF WE COULD ONLY GET HIM OUT OF THE WAY WE MIGHT SUCCEED BETTER I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU ANSWERED THE SECOND BROTHER
2092-145706-0005 AND MY ADVICE IS TO EAT UP HIS LOAF OF BREAD AND THEN TO REFUSE TO GIVE HIM A BIT OF OURS UNTIL HE HAS PROMISED TO LET US PUT OUT HIS EYES OR BREAK HIS LEGS HIS ELDEST BROTHER WAS DELIGHTED WITH THIS PROPOSAL
2092-145706-0006 AND THE TWO WICKED WRETCHES SEIZED FERKO'S LOAF AND ATE IT ALL UP WHILE THE POOR BOY WAS STILL ASLEEP WHEN HE DID AWAKE HE FELT VERY HUNGRY AND TURNED TO EAT HIS BREAD BUT HIS BROTHERS CRIED OUT
2092-145706-0007 YOU ATE YOUR LOAF IN YOUR SLEEP YOU GLUTTON AND YOU MAY STARVE AS LONG AS YOU LIKE BUT YOU WON'T GET A SCRAP OF OURS FERKO WAS AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND HOW HE COULD HAVE EATEN IN HIS SLEEP BUT HE SAID NOTHING
2092-145706-0008 AND FASTED ALL THAT DAY AND THE NEXT NIGHT BUT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING HE WAS SO HUNGRY THAT HE BURST INTO TEARS AND IMPLORED HIS BROTHERS TO GIVE HIM A LITTLE BIT OF THEIR BREAD
2092-145706-0009 AND BREAK ONE OF YOUR LEGS THEN WE WILL GIVE YOU A BIT OF OUR BREAD AT THESE WORDS POOR FERKO WEPT MORE BITTERLY THAN BEFORE AND BORE THE TORMENTS OF HUNGER TILL THE SUN WAS HIGH IN THE HEAVENS
2092-145706-0010 THEN HE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER AND HE CONSENTED TO ALLOW HIS LEFT EYE TO BE PUT OUT AND HIS LEFT LEG TO BE BROKEN WHEN THIS WAS DONE HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND EAGERLY FOR THE PIECE OF BREAD
2092-145706-0011 BUT HIS BROTHERS GAVE HIM SUCH A TINY SCRAP THAT THE STARVING YOUTH FINISHED IT IN A MOMENT AND BESOUGHT THEM FOR A SECOND BIT BUT THE MORE FERKO WEPT AND TOLD HIS BROTHERS THAT HE WAS DYING OF HUNGER
2092-145706-0012 THE MORE THEY LAUGHED AND SCOLDED HIM FOR HIS GREED SO HE ENDURED THE PANGS OF STARVATION ALL THAT DAY BUT WHEN NIGHT CAME HIS ENDURANCE GAVE WAY AND HE LET HIS RIGHT EYE BE PUT OUT
2092-145706-0013 AND HIS RIGHT LEG BROKEN FOR A SECOND PIECE OF BREAD AFTER HIS BROTHERS HAD THUS SUCCESSFULLY MAIMED AND DISFIGURED HIM FOR LIFE THEY LEFT HIM GROANING ON THE GROUND AND CONTINUED THEIR JOURNEY WITHOUT HIM
2092-145706-0014 POOR FERKO ATE UP THE SCRAP OF BREAD THEY HAD LEFT HIM AND WEPT BITTERLY BUT NO ONE HEARD HIM OR CAME TO HIS HELP NIGHT CAME ON AND THE POOR BLIND YOUTH HAD NO EYES TO CLOSE
2092-145706-0015 AND COULD ONLY CRAWL ALONG THE GROUND NOT KNOWING IN THE LEAST WHERE HE WAS GOING BUT WHEN THE SUN WAS ONCE MORE HIGH IN THE HEAVENS FERKO FELT THE BLAZING HEAT SCORCH HIM
2092-145706-0016 AND SOUGHT FOR SOME COOL SHADY PLACE TO REST HIS ACHING LIMBS HE CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF A HILL AND LAY DOWN IN THE GRASS AND AS HE THOUGHT UNDER THE SHADOW OF A BIG TREE
2092-145706-0017 IS THERE ANYTHING THE LEAST WONDERFUL OR REMARKABLE ABOUT THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD I SHOULD JUST THINK THERE WAS REPLIED THE OTHER MANY THINGS THAT DON'T EXIST ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD
2092-145706-0018 THERE IS A LAKE DOWN THERE BELOW US AND ANYONE WHO BATHES IN IT THOUGH HE WERE AT DEATH'S DOOR BECOMES SOUND AND WELL ON THE SPOT AND THOSE WHO WASH THEIR EYES WITH THE DEW ON THIS HILL
2092-145706-0019 BECOME AS SHARP SIGHTED AS THE EAGLE EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN BLIND FROM THEIR YOUTH WELL ANSWERED THE FIRST RAVEN MY EYES ARE IN NO WANT OF THIS HEALING BATH FOR HEAVEN BE PRAISED
2092-145706-0020 THEY ARE AS GOOD AS EVER THEY WERE BUT MY WING HAS BEEN VERY FEEBLE AND WEAK EVER SINCE IT WAS SHOT BY AN ARROW MANY YEARS AGO SO LET US FLY AT ONCE TO THE LAKE THAT I MAY BE RESTORED TO HEALTH AND STRENGTH AGAIN
2092-145706-0021 AND SO THEY FLEW AWAY THEIR WORDS REJOICED FERKO'S HEART AND HE WAITED IMPATIENTLY TILL EVENING SHOULD COME AND HE COULD RUB THE PRECIOUS DEW ON HIS SIGHTLESS EYES
2092-145706-0022 AT LAST IT BEGAN TO GROW DUSK AND THE SUN SANK BEHIND THE MOUNTAINS GRADUALLY IT BECAME COOLER ON THE HILL AND THE GRASS GREW WET WITH DEW THEN FERKO BURIED HIS FACE IN THE GROUND
2092-145706-0023 TILL HIS EYES WERE DAMP WITH DEWDROPS AND IN A MOMENT HE SAW CLEARER THAN HE HAD EVER DONE IN HIS LIFE BEFORE THE MOON WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY AND LIGHTED HIM TO THE LAKE WHERE HE COULD BATHE HIS POOR BROKEN LEGS
2092-145706-0024 THEN FERKO CRAWLED TO THE EDGE OF THE LAKE AND DIPPED HIS LIMBS IN THE WATER NO SOONER HAD HE DONE SO
2092-145706-0025 HE HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE HE MET A WOLF WHO WAS LIMPING DISCONSOLATELY ALONG ON THREE LEGS AND WHO ON PERCEIVING FERKO BEGAN TO HOWL DISMALLY MY GOOD FRIEND SAID THE YOUTH
2092-145706-0026 BE OF GOOD CHEER FOR I CAN SOON HEAL YOUR LEG AND WITH THESE WORDS HE POURED SOME OF THE PRECIOUS WATER OVER THE WOLF'S PAW AND IN A MINUTE THE ANIMAL WAS SPRINGING ABOUT SOUND AND WELL ON ALL FOURS
2092-145706-0027 THE GRATEFUL CREATURE THANKED HIS BENEFACTOR WARMLY AND PROMISED FERKO TO DO HIM A GOOD TURN IF HE SHOULD EVER NEED IT FERKO CONTINUED HIS WAY TILL HE CAME TO A PLOUGHED FIELD
2092-145706-0028 HERE HE NOTICED A LITTLE MOUSE CREEPING WEARILY ALONG ON ITS HIND PAWS FOR ITS FRONT PAWS HAD BOTH BEEN BROKEN IN A TRAP FERKO FELT SO SORRY FOR THE LITTLE BEAST
2092-145706-0029 THAT HE SPOKE TO IT IN THE MOST FRIENDLY MANNER AND WASHED ITS SMALL PAWS WITH THE HEALING WATER IN A MOMENT THE MOUSE WAS SOUND AND WHOLE AND AFTER THANKING THE KIND PHYSICIAN IT SCAMPERED AWAY OVER THE PLOUGHED FURROWS
2092-145706-0030 FERKO AGAIN PROCEEDED ON HIS JOURNEY BUT HE HADN'T GONE FAR BEFORE A QUEEN BEE FLEW AGAINST HIM TRAILING ONE WING BEHIND HER WHICH HAD BEEN CRUELLY TORN IN TWO BY A BIG BIRD
2092-145706-0031 FERKO WAS NO LESS WILLING TO HELP HER THAN HE HAD BEEN TO HELP THE WOLF AND THE MOUSE SO HE POURED SOME HEALING DROPS OVER THE WOUNDED WING ON THE SPOT THE QUEEN BEE WAS CURED AND TURNING TO FERKO SHE SAID
2092-145706-0032 I AM MOST GRATEFUL FOR YOUR KINDNESS AND SHALL REWARD YOU SOME DAY AND WITH THESE WORDS SHE FLEW AWAY HUMMING GAILY THEN FERKO WANDERED ON FOR MANY A LONG DAY
2092-145706-0033 AND AT LENGTH REACHED A STRANGE KINGDOM HERE HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF HE MIGHT AS WELL GO STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE AND OFFER HIS SERVICES TO THE KING OF THE COUNTRY FOR HE HAD HEARD THAT THE KING'S DAUGHTER
2092-145706-0034 THEY HAD MANAGED TO OBTAIN PLACES IN THE KING'S SERVICE AND WHEN THEY RECOGNISED FERKO WITH HIS EYES AND LEGS SOUND AND WELL THEY WERE FRIGHTENED TO DEATH FOR THEY FEARED HE WOULD TELL THE KING OF THEIR CONDUCT
2092-145706-0035 FOR SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE SO HANDSOME IN HER LIFE BEFORE HIS BROTHERS NOTICED THIS AND ENVY AND JEALOUSY WERE ADDED TO THEIR FEAR SO MUCH SO THAT THEY DETERMINED ONCE MORE TO DESTROY HIM
2092-145706-0036 THEY WENT TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM THAT FERKO WAS A WICKED MAGICIAN WHO HAD COME TO THE PALACE WITH THE INTENTION OF CARRYING OFF THE PRINCESS THEN THE KING HAD FERKO BROUGHT BEFORE HIM AND SAID
2092-145706-0037 YOU ARE ACCUSED OF BEING A MAGICIAN WHO WISHES TO ROB ME OF MY DAUGHTER AND I CONDEMN YOU TO DEATH BUT IF YOU CAN FULFIL THREE TASKS WHICH I SHALL SET YOU TO DO YOUR LIFE SHALL BE SPARED
2092-145706-0038 ON CONDITION YOU LEAVE THE COUNTRY BUT IF YOU CANNOT PERFORM WHAT I DEMAND YOU SHALL BE HUNG ON THE NEAREST TREE AND TURNING TO THE TWO WICKED BROTHERS HE SAID SUGGEST SOMETHING FOR HIM TO DO
2092-145706-0039 NO MATTER HOW DIFFICULT HE MUST SUCCEED IN IT OR DIE THEY DID NOT THINK LONG BUT REPLIED LET HIM BUILD YOUR MAJESTY IN ONE DAY A MORE BEAUTIFUL PALACE THAN THIS AND IF HE FAILS IN THE ATTEMPT
2092-145706-0040 LET HIM BE HUNG THE KING WAS PLEASED WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND COMMANDED FERKO TO SET TO WORK ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE TWO BROTHERS WERE DELIGHTED FOR THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD NOW GOT RID OF FERKO FOR EVER
2092-145706-0041 AS HE WAS WANDERING DISCONSOLATELY ABOUT THE MEADOWS ROUND THE PALACE WONDERING HOW HE COULD ESCAPE BEING PUT TO DEATH A LITTLE BEE FLEW PAST AND SETTLING ON HIS SHOULDER WHISPERED IN HIS EAR
2092-145706-0042 WHAT IS TROUBLING YOU MY KIND BENEFACTOR CAN I BE OF ANY HELP TO YOU I AM THE BEE WHOSE WING YOU HEALED
2092-145706-0043 A PALACE SHALL BE BUILT UNLIKE ANY THAT KING HAS DWELT IN BEFORE JUST STAY HERE TILL I COME AGAIN AND TELL YOU THAT IT IS FINISHED HAVING SAID THIS SHE FLEW MERRILY AWAY AND FERKO
2092-145706-0044 BE OF GOOD CHEER AND LEAD THE KING TO THE HILL JUST OUTSIDE THE CITY WALLS AND HUMMING GAILY SHE FLEW AWAY AGAIN FERKO WENT AT ONCE TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM THE PALACE WAS FINISHED
2092-145706-0045 THE WHOLE COURT WENT OUT TO SEE THE WONDER AND THEIR ASTONISHMENT WAS GREAT AT THE SIGHT WHICH MET THEIR EYES A SPLENDID PALACE REARED ITSELF ON THE HILL JUST OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF THE CITY MADE OF THE MOST EXQUISITE FLOWERS
2092-145706-0046 WITH SUNFLOWERS FOR KNOCKERS AND ALL ROUND HYACINTHS AND OTHER SWEET SMELLING FLOWERS BLOOMED IN MASSES SO THAT THE AIR WAS PERFUMED FAR AND NEAR AND ENCHANTED ALL WHO WERE PRESENT
2092-145706-0047 THIS SPLENDID PALACE HAD BEEN BUILT BY THE GRATEFUL QUEEN BEE WHO HAD SUMMONED ALL THE OTHER BEES IN THE KINGDOM TO HELP HER THE KING'S AMAZEMENT KNEW NO BOUNDS AND THE PRINCESS'S EYES BEAMED WITH DELIGHT
2092-145706-0048 ON THE DELIGHTED FERKO BUT THE TWO BROTHERS HAD GROWN QUITE GREEN WITH ENVY AND ONLY DECLARED THE MORE THAT FERKO WAS NOTHING BUT A WICKED MAGICIAN
2092-145706-0049 THE KING ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN SURPRISED AND ASTONISHED AT THE WAY HIS COMMANDS HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT WAS VERY VEXED
2092-145706-0050 AND TURNING TO THE TWO BROTHERS HE SAID HE HAS CERTAINLY ACCOMPLISHED THE FIRST TASK WITH THE AID NO DOUBT OF HIS DIABOLICAL MAGIC BUT WHAT SHALL WE GIVE HIM TO DO NOW
2092-145706-0051 LET US MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE AND IF HE FAILS HE SHALL DIE THEN THE ELDEST BROTHER REPLIED THE CORN HAS ALL BEEN CUT BUT IT HAS NOT YET BEEN PUT INTO BARNS
2092-145706-0052 LET THE KNAVE COLLECT ALL THE GRAIN IN THE KINGDOM INTO ONE BIG HEAP BEFORE TO MORROW NIGHT AND IF AS MUCH AS A STALK OF CORN IS LEFT LET HIM BE PUT TO DEATH
2092-145706-0053 THE PRINCESS GREW WHITE WITH TERROR WHEN SHE HEARD THESE WORDS BUT FERKO FELT MUCH MORE CHEERFUL THAN HE HAD DONE THE FIRST TIME AND WANDERED OUT INTO THE MEADOWS AGAIN
2092-145706-0054 BUT HE COULD THINK OF NO WAY OF ESCAPE THE SUN SANK TO REST AND NIGHT CAME ON WHEN A LITTLE MOUSE STARTED OUT OF THE GRASS AT FERKO'S FEET AND SAID TO HIM I'M DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU
2092-145706-0055 MY KIND BENEFACTOR BUT WHY ARE YOU LOOKING SO SAD CAN I BE OF ANY HELP TO YOU AND THUS REPAY YOUR GREAT KINDNESS TO ME THEN FERKO RECOGNISED THE MOUSE WHOSE FRONT PAWS HE HAD HEALED AND REPLIED
2092-145706-0056 BEFORE TO MORROW NIGHT ALL THE GRAIN IN THE KINGDOM HAS TO BE GATHERED INTO ONE BIG HEAP AND IF AS MUCH AS A STALK OF CORN IS WANTING I MUST PAY FOR IT WITH MY LIFE IS THAT ALL ANSWERED THE MOUSE
2092-145706-0057 THAT NEEDN'T DISTRESS YOU MUCH JUST TRUST IN ME AND BEFORE THE SUN SETS AGAIN YOU SHALL HEAR THAT YOUR TASK IS DONE AND WITH THESE WORDS THE LITTLE CREATURE SCAMPERED AWAY INTO THE FIELDS
2092-145706-0058 FERKO WHO NEVER DOUBTED THAT THE MOUSE WOULD BE AS GOOD AS ITS WORD LAY DOWN COMFORTED ON THE SOFT GRASS AND SLEPT SOUNDLY TILL NEXT MORNING THE DAY PASSED SLOWLY
2092-145706-0059 AND THE WHOLE COURT WENT OUT TO SEE THE WONDER
2092-145706-0060 FOR IN A HEAP HIGHER THAN THE KING'S PALACE LAY ALL THE GRAIN OF THE COUNTRY AND NOT A SINGLE STALK OF CORN HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND IN ANY OF THE FIELDS AND HOW HAD ALL THIS BEEN DONE
2092-145706-0061 THE LITTLE MOUSE HAD SUMMONED EVERY OTHER MOUSE IN THE LAND TO ITS HELP AND TOGETHER THEY HAD COLLECTED ALL THE GRAIN IN THE KINGDOM THE KING COULD NOT HIDE HIS AMAZEMENT BUT AT THE SAME TIME HIS WRATH INCREASED
2092-145706-0062 AND HE WAS MORE READY THAN EVER TO BELIEVE THE TWO BROTHERS WHO KEPT ON REPEATING
2092-145706-0063 THAN A WICKED MAGICIAN ONLY THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS REJOICED OVER FERKO'S SUCCESS AND LOOKED ON HIM WITH FRIENDLY GLANCES WHICH THE YOUTH RETURNED THE MORE THE CRUEL KING GAZED ON THE WONDER BEFORE HIM
2092-145706-0064 THE MORE ANGRY HE BECAME FOR HE COULD NOT IN THE FACE OF HIS PROMISE PUT THE STRANGER TO DEATH HE TURNED ONCE MORE TO THE TWO BROTHERS AND SAID HIS DIABOLICAL MAGIC HAS HELPED HIM AGAIN
2092-145706-0065 BUT NOW WHAT THIRD TASK SHALL WE SET HIM TO DO NO MATTER HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS HE MUST DO IT OR DIE THE ELDEST ANSWERED QUICKLY LET HIM DRIVE ALL THE WOLVES OF THE KINGDOM ON TO THIS HILL
2092-145706-0066 BEFORE TO MORROW NIGHT IF HE DOES THIS HE MAY GO FREE IF NOT HE SHALL BE HUNG AS YOU HAVE SAID AT THESE WORDS THE PRINCESS BURST INTO TEARS
2092-145706-0067 AND WHEN THE KING SAW THIS HE ORDERED HER TO BE SHUT UP IN A HIGH TOWER AND CAREFULLY GUARDED TILL THE DANGEROUS MAGICIAN SHOULD EITHER HAVE LEFT THE KINGDOM OR BEEN HUNG ON THE NEAREST TREE FERKO WANDERED OUT INTO THE FIELDS AGAIN
2092-145706-0068 AND SAT DOWN ON THE STUMP OF A TREE WONDERING WHAT HE SHOULD DO NEXT SUDDENLY A BIG WOLF RAN UP TO HIM AND STANDING STILL SAID I'M VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN MY KIND BENEFACTOR
2092-145706-0069 WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT ALL ALONE BY YOURSELF IF I CAN HELP YOU IN ANY WAY ONLY SAY THE WORD FOR I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU A PROOF OF MY GRATITUDE FERKO AT ONCE RECOGNISED THE WOLF
2092-145706-0070 WHOSE BROKEN LEG HE HAD HEALED AND TOLD HIM WHAT HE HAD TO DO THE FOLLOWING DAY IF HE WISHED TO ESCAPE WITH HIS LIFE BUT HOW IN THE WORLD HE ADDED AM I TO COLLECT ALL THE WOLVES OF THE KINGDOM ON TO THAT HILL OVER THERE
2092-145706-0071 IF THAT'S ALL YOU WANT DONE ANSWERED THE WOLF YOU NEEDN'T WORRY YOURSELF I'LL UNDERTAKE THE TASK AND YOU'LL HEAR FROM ME AGAIN BEFORE SUNSET TO MORROW
2092-145706-0072 AND WITH THESE WORDS HE TROTTED QUICKLY AWAY THEN THE YOUTH REJOICED GREATLY FOR NOW HE FELT THAT HIS LIFE WAS SAFE BUT HE GREW VERY SAD WHEN HE THOUGHT OF THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS
2092-145706-0073 AND THAT HE WOULD NEVER SEE HER AGAIN IF HE LEFT THE COUNTRY HE LAY DOWN ONCE MORE ON THE GRASS AND SOON FELL FAST ASLEEP ALL THE NEXT DAY HE SPENT WANDERING ABOUT THE FIELDS
2092-145706-0074 THEN RETURN AT ONCE TO ME AND GET ON MY BACK AND I WILL HELP YOU TO DRIVE ALL THE WOLVES TOGETHER THEN FERKO WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE AND TOLD THE KING THAT HE WAS READY TO PERFORM THE THIRD TASK IF HE WOULD COME TO THE HILL AND SEE IT DONE
2092-145706-0075 FERKO HIMSELF RETURNED TO THE FIELDS AND MOUNTING ON THE WOLF'S BACK HE RODE TO THE WOOD CLOSE BY QUICK AS LIGHTNING THE WOLF FLEW ROUND THE WOOD AND IN A MINUTE MANY HUNDRED WOLVES ROSE UP BEFORE HIM
2092-145706-0076 INCREASING IN NUMBER EVERY MOMENT TILL THEY COULD BE COUNTED BY THOUSANDS HE DROVE THEM ALL BEFORE HIM ON TO THE HILL WHERE THE KING AND HIS WHOLE COURT AND FERKO'S TWO BROTHERS WERE STANDING ONLY THE LOVELY PRINCESS WAS NOT PRESENT
2092-145706-0077 FOR SHE WAS SHUT UP IN HER TOWER WEEPING BITTERLY THE WICKED BROTHERS STAMPED AND FOAMED WITH RAGE WHEN THEY SAW THE FAILURE OF THEIR WICKED DESIGNS BUT THE KING WAS OVERCOME BY A SUDDEN TERROR
2092-145706-0078 WHEN HE SAW THE ENORMOUS PACK OF WOLVES APPROACHING NEARER AND NEARER AND CALLING OUT TO FERKO HE SAID ENOUGH ENOUGH WE DON'T WANT ANY MORE BUT THE WOLF ON WHOSE BACK FERKO SAT SAID TO ITS RIDER
2092-145706-0079 GO ON GO ON AND AT THE SAME MOMENT MANY MORE WOLVES RAN UP THE HILL HOWLING HORRIBLY AND SHOWING THEIR WHITE TEETH THE KING IN HIS TERROR CALLED OUT STOP A MOMENT I WILL GIVE YOU HALF MY KINGDOM
2092-145706-0080 IF YOU WILL DRIVE ALL THE WOLVES AWAY BUT FERKO PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR AND DROVE SOME MORE THOUSANDS BEFORE HIM SO THAT EVERYONE QUAKED WITH HORROR AND FEAR THEN THE KING RAISED HIS VOICE AGAIN AND CALLED OUT
2092-145706-0081 STOP YOU SHALL HAVE MY WHOLE KINGDOM IF YOU WILL ONLY DRIVE THESE WOLVES BACK TO THE PLACES THEY CAME FROM BUT THE WOLF KEPT ON ENCOURAGING FERKO AND SAID GO ON GO ON SO HE LED THE WOLVES ON
2092-145706-0082 TILL AT LAST THEY FELL ON THE KING AND ON THE WICKED BROTHERS AND ATE THEM AND THE WHOLE COURT UP IN A MOMENT THEN FERKO WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE AND SET THE PRINCESS FREE AND ON THE SAME DAY
2092-145706-0083 HE MARRIED HER AND WAS CROWNED KING OF THE COUNTRY AND THE WOLVES ALL WENT PEACEFULLY BACK TO THEIR OWN HOMES AND FERKO AND HIS BRIDE LIVED FOR MANY YEARS IN PEACE AND HAPPINESS TOGETHER
2092-145709-0000 KLETKE ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WERE THREE PRINCESSES WHO WERE ALL THREE YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL BUT THE YOUNGEST ALTHOUGH SHE WAS NOT FAIRER THAN THE OTHER TWO WAS THE MOST LOVEABLE OF THEM ALL
2092-145709-0001 ABOUT HALF A MILE FROM THE PALACE IN WHICH THEY LIVED THERE STOOD A CASTLE WHICH WAS UNINHABITED AND ALMOST A RUIN BUT THE GARDEN WHICH SURROUNDED IT WAS A MASS OF BLOOMING FLOWERS
2092-145709-0002 AND IN THIS GARDEN THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS USED OFTEN TO WALK ONE DAY WHEN SHE WAS PACING TO AND FRO UNDER THE LIME TREES A BLACK CROW HOPPED OUT OF A ROSE BUSH IN FRONT OF HER
2092-145709-0003 THE POOR BEAST WAS ALL TORN AND BLEEDING AND THE KIND LITTLE PRINCESS WAS QUITE UNHAPPY ABOUT IT WHEN THE CROW SAW THIS IT TURNED TO HER AND SAID I AM NOT REALLY A BLACK CROW
2092-145709-0004 BUT AN ENCHANTED PRINCE WHO HAS BEEN DOOMED TO SPEND HIS YOUTH IN MISERY IF YOU ONLY LIKED PRINCESS YOU COULD SAVE ME BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO SAY GOOD BYE TO ALL YOUR OWN PEOPLE
2092-145709-0005 AND COME AND BE MY CONSTANT COMPANION IN THIS RUINED CASTLE THERE IS ONE HABITABLE ROOM IN IT IN WHICH THERE IS A GOLDEN BED THERE YOU WILL HAVE TO LIVE ALL BY YOURSELF
2092-145709-0006 AND DON'T FORGET THAT WHATEVER YOU MAY SEE OR HEAR IN THE NIGHT YOU MUST NOT SCREAM OUT FOR IF YOU GIVE AS MUCH AS A SINGLE CRY MY SUFFERINGS WILL BE DOUBLED
2092-145709-0007 THE GOOD NATURED PRINCESS AT ONCE LEFT HER HOME AND HER FAMILY AND HURRIED TO THE RUINED CASTLE AND TOOK POSSESSION OF THE ROOM WITH THE GOLDEN BED
2092-145709-0008 WHEN NIGHT APPROACHED SHE LAY DOWN BUT THOUGH SHE SHUT HER EYES TIGHT SLEEP WOULD NOT COME AT MIDNIGHT SHE HEARD TO HER GREAT HORROR SOME ONE COMING ALONG THE PASSAGE AND IN A MINUTE
2092-145709-0009 HER DOOR WAS FLUNG WIDE OPEN AND A TROOP OF STRANGE BEINGS ENTERED THE ROOM THEY AT ONCE PROCEEDED TO LIGHT A FIRE IN THE HUGE FIREPLACE THEN THEY PLACED A GREAT CAULDRON OF BOILING WATER ON IT
