8088-284756-0037 I WALKED ALONG BRISKLY FOR PERHAPS FIVE MINUTES
8088-284756-0038 THE SHORE WAS LITTERED WITH ALL SORTS OF FLOTSAM AND JETSAM WASHED UP BY THE BIG STORM AND I WAS JUST THINKING THAT I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A MAN WITH A TRUCK COME AND CLEAN UP THE SHORE IN FRONT OF THE PLACE WHEN IN A LITTLE SANDY POOL I SAW HER
8088-284756-0039 SHE WAS LAYING FACE DOWN IN THE WATER MOTIONLESS HER HEAD TOWARDS THE SEA ONE ARM STRETCHED OUT BEFORE HER AND HER LONG HAIR WRAPPED AROUND HER LIKE A HALF TRANSPARENT CLOAK I RAN UP AND LIFTED HER FROM THE WATER HER BODY WAS COLD AND DEATHLY WHITE
8088-284756-0040 AND TOOK THE LIQUOR IN A SINGLE DRAUGHT SHE DID NOT SEEM TO DRINK IT BUT SUCKED IT OUT OF THE GLASS IN A SINGLE AMAZING GULP THAT'S THE ONLY WORD FOR IT
8088-284756-0041 WEBBED I ASKED STARTLED WEBBED NODDED MERCER SOLEMNLY AS ARE HER FEET BUT LISTEN TAYLOR I WAS AMAZED AND NOT A LITTLE RATTLED WHEN SHE CAME FOR ME
8088-284756-0042 I RAN THROUGH THE FRENCH WINDOWS OUT INTO THE PATIO FOR A MOMENT SHE RAN AFTER ME RATHER AWKWARDLY AND HEAVILY BUT SWIFTLY NEVERTHELESS THEN SHE SAW THE POOL APPARENTLY FORGETTING THAT I EXISTED SHE LEAPED INTO THE WATER
8088-284756-0043 I REMINDED HIM AS HE PAUSED APPARENTLY LOST IN THOUGHT I TRIED TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT HER I PUT ON MY BATHING SUIT AND DIVED INTO THE POOL WELL SHE CAME AT ME LIKE A SHARK QUICK AS A FLASH HER TEETH SHOWING HER HANDS TEARING LIKE CLAWS THROUGH THE WATER
8088-284756-0044 SHE MANAGED TO CLAW ME JUST ONCE MERCER RESUMED WRAPPING THE ROBE ABOUT HIM AGAIN THEN I GOT OUT AND CALLED ON CARSON FOR HELP I PUT HIM INTO A BATHING SUIT AND WE BOTH ENDEAVORED TO CORNER HER
8088-284756-0045 CARSON GOT TWO BAD SCRATCHES AND ONE RATHER SERIOUS BITE THAT I HAVE BANDAGED I HAVE A NUMBER OF LACERATIONS BUT I DIDN'T FARE SO BADLY AS CARSON BECAUSE I AM FASTER IN THE WATER THAN HE IS THE HARDER WE TRIED THE MORE DETERMINED I BECAME
8088-284756-0046 WE MOVED OUT OF THE ROOM NOTHING HUMAN CAN LIVE UNDER WATER AND BREATHE WATER AS SHE DOES MERCER PAUSED A MOMENT STARING AT ME ODDLY THE HUMAN RACE HE SAID GRAVELY CAME UP OUT OF SEA THE HUMAN RACE AS WE KNOW IT SOME MAY HAVE GONE BACK
8088-284756-0047 MERCER SOME MAY HAVE GONE BACK I DON'T GET IT MERCER SHOOK HIS HEAD BUT MADE NO OTHER REPLY UNTIL WE STOOD AGAIN ON THE EDGE OF THE POOL THE GIRL WAS STANDING WHERE WE HAD LEFT HER AND AS SHE LOOKED UP INTO MY FACE SHE SMILED AGAIN
8088-284756-0048 AND IN THAT WHITE BATHING SUIT YES I BELIEVE SHE'S TAKEN A FANCY TO YOU MERCER'S EYES WERE DANCING IF SHE HAS HE WENT ON IT'LL MAKE OUR WORK VERY EASY WHAT WORK I ASKED SUSPICIOUSLY
8088-284756-0049 I THINK I HAVE WHAT YOU CALL MY THOUGHT TELEGRAPH PERFECTED EXPERIMENTALLY HE EXPLAINED RAPIDLY I FELL ASLEEP WORKING ON IT AT THREE O'CLOCK OR THEREABOUTS THIS MORNING AND SOME TESTS WITH CARSON SEEM TO INDICATE THAT IT IS A SUCCESS
8088-284756-0050 I SHOULD HAVE CALLED YOU TO MORROW FOR FURTHER TEST NEARLY FIVE YEARS OF DAMNED HARD WORK TO A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION TAYLOR
8088-284756-0051 I ASKED EAGERLY GLANCING DOWN AT THE BEAUTIFUL PALE FACE THAT GLIMMERED UP AT ME THROUGH THE CLEAR WATER OF THE POOL WHY TRY IT ON HER EXCLAIMED MERCER WITH MOUNTING ENTHUSIASM DON'T YOU SEE TAYLOR
8088-284756-0052 IF IT WILL WORK ON HER AND WE CAN DIRECT HER THOUGHTS WE CAN FIND OUT HER HISTORY THE HISTORY OF HER PEOPLE WE'LL ADD A PAGE TO SCIENTIFIC HISTORY A WHOLE BIG CHAPTER THAT WILL MAKE US FAMOUS MAN THIS IS SO BIG IT'S SWEPT ME OFF MY FEET
8088-284756-0053 LOOK AND HE HELD OUT A THIN ARISTOCRATIC BROWN HAND BEFORE MY EYES A HAND THAT SHOOK WITH NERVOUS EXCITEMENT I DON'T BLAME YOU I SAID QUICKLY
8088-284756-0054 LET'S GET BUSY WHAT CAN I DO MERCER REACHED AROUND THE DOOR INTO THE LABORATORY AND PRESSED A BUTTON FOR CARSON HE EXPLAINED WE'LL NEED HIS HELP IN THE MEANTIME WE'LL LOOK OVER THE SET UP THE APPARATUS IS STREWN ALL OVER THE PLACE
8088-284756-0055 HE HAD NOT EXAGGERATED THE SET UP CONSISTED OF A WHOLE BANK OF TUBES EACH ONE IN ITS OWN SHIELDING COPPER BOX ON A MUCH DRILLED HORIZONTAL PANEL PROPPED UP ON INSULATORS WERE HALF A SCORE OF DELICATE METERS OF ONE KIND AND ANOTHER
8088-284756-0056 WITH THIN BLACK FINGERS THAT PULSED AND TREMBLED BEHIND THE PANEL WAS A TALL CYLINDER WOUND WITH SHINING COPPER WIRE AND BESIDE IT ANOTHER PANEL UPRIGHT FAIRLY BRISTLING WITH KNOBS CONTACT POINTS POTENTIOMETERS RHEOSTATS AND SWITCHES
8088-284756-0057 AND IN THE CENTER A SWITCH WITH FOUR CONTACT POINTS A HEAVY SNAKY CABLE LED FROM THIS PANEL TO THE MAZE OF APPARATUS FURTHER ON THIS IS THE CONTROL PANEL EXPLAINED MERCER THE WHOLE AFFAIR YOU UNDERSTAND IS IN LABORATORY FORM
8088-284756-0058 NOTHING ASSEMBLED PUT THE DIFFERENT ANTENNAE PLUG INTO THESE JACKS LIKE THIS HE PICKED UP A WEIRD HASTILY BUILT CONTRIVANCE COMPOSED OF TWO SEMI CIRCULAR PIECES OF SPRING BRASS CROSSED AT RIGHT ANGLES
8088-284756-0059 ON ALL FOUR ENDS WERE BRIGHT SILVERY ELECTRODES THREE OF THEM CIRCULAR IN SHAPE ONE OF THEM ELONGATED AND SLIGHTLY CURVED WITH A QUICK NERVOUS GESTURE MERCER FITTED THE THING TO HIS HEAD
8088-284756-0060 SO THAT THE ELONGATED ELECTRODE PRESSED AGAINST THE BACK OF HIS NECK EXTENDING A FEW INCHES DOWN HIS SPINE THE OTHER THREE CIRCULAR ELECTRODES RESTED ON HIS FOREHEAD AND EITHER SIDE OF HIS HEAD
8088-284756-0061 SOME TEN FEET IN LENGTH ENDING IN A SIMPLE SWITCHBOARD PLUG WHICH MERCER FITTED INTO THE UPPERMOST OF THE THREE JACKS NOW HE DIRECTED YOU PUT ON THIS ONE
8088-284756-0062 HE ADJUSTED A SECOND CONTRIVANCE UPON MY HEAD SMILING AS I SHRANK FROM THE CONTACT OF THE COLD METAL ON MY SKIN AND THINK HE MOVED THE SWITCH FROM THE POSITION MARKED OFF TO THE SECOND CONTACT POINT WATCHING ME INTENTLY HIS DARK EYES GLEAMING
8088-284756-0063 VERY NICE OLD CHAP CARSON IMPRESSIVE EVEN IN HIS BATHING SUIT MERCER WAS MIGHTY LUCKY TO HAVE A MAN LIKE CARSON SOMETHING SEEMED TO TICK SUDDENLY SOMEWHERE DEEP IN MY CONSCIOUSNESS YES THAT'S VERY TRUE
8088-284756-0064 THE WORDS WERE NOT SPOKEN I DID NOT HEAR THEM I KNEW THEM WHAT I GLANCED AT MERCER AND HE LAUGHED ALOUD WITH PLEASURE AND EXCITEMENT IT WORKED HE CRIED
8088-284756-0065 I RECEIVED YOUR THOUGHT REGARDING CARSON AND THEN TURNED THE SWITCH SO THAT YOU RECEIVED MY THOUGHT AND YOU DID RATHER GINGERLY I REMOVED THE THING FROM MY HEAD AND LAID IT ON THE TABLE IT'S WIZARDRY MERCER IF IT WILL WORK AS WELL ON HER IT WILL I KNOW IT WILL
8088-284756-0066 IF WE CAN GET HER TO WEAR ONE OF THESE REPLIED MERCER CONFIDENTLY I HAVE ONLY THREE OF THEM I HAD PLANNED SOME THREE CORNERED EXPERIMENTS WITH YOU CARSON AND MYSELF WE'LL LEAVE CARSON OUT OF TO NIGHT'S EXPERIMENT HOWEVER FOR WE'LL NEED HIM TO OPERATE THIS SWITCH
8088-284756-0067 THE OTHER TWO RECEIVE WHEN THE SWITCH IS ON THE FIRST CONTACT NUMBER ONE SENDS AND NUMBERS TWO AND THREE RECEIVE WHEN THE SWITCH IS ON NUMBER TWO THEN HE SENDS THOUGHTS AND NUMBERS ONE AND THREE RECEIVE THEM AND SO ON
8088-284756-0068 I'LL LENGTHEN THESE LEADS SO THAT WE CAN RUN THEM OUT INTO THE POOL AND THEN WE'LL BE READY SOMEHOW WE MUST INDUCE HER TO WEAR ONE OF THESE THINGS EVEN IF WE HAVE TO USE FORCE I'M SURE THE THREE OF US CAN HANDLE HER WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO I SMILED
8088-284756-0069 SHE WAS SUCH A SLIM GRACEFUL ALMOST DELICATE LITTLE THING THE THOUGHT THAT THREE STRONG MEN MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL HER SEEMED ALMOST AMUSING YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER IN ACTION YET SAID MERCER GRIMLY
8088-284756-0070 THEN WITH ALL THREE OF THE DEVICES HE CALLED ANTENNAE IN HIS HAND THEIR LEADS PLUGGED INTO THE CONTROL PANEL HE LED THE WAY TO THE SIDE OF THE POOL
8088-284756-0071 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD SEEN HER MOVE IN THIS FASHION SHE SEEMED TO PROPEL HERSELF WITH A SUDDEN MIGHTY THRUST OF HER FEET AGAINST THE BOTTOM SHE DARTED THROUGH THE WATER WITH THE SPEED OF AN ARROW YET STOPPED AS GENTLY AS THOUGH SHE HAD MERELY FLOATED THERE
8088-284756-0072 AS SHE LOOKED UP HER EYES UNMISTAKABLY SOUGHT MINE AND HER SMILE SEEMED WARM AND INVITING SHE MADE AGAIN THAT STRANGE LITTLE GESTURE OF INVITATION WITH AN EFFORT I GLANCED AT MERCER
8088-284756-0073 THERE WAS SOMETHING DEVILISHLY FASCINATING ABOUT THE GIRL'S GREAT DARK SEARCHING EYES I'M GOING IN I SAID HOARSELY
8088-284756-0074 I HEADED DIRECTLY TOWARDS THE HEAVY BRONZE LADDER THAT LED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL I HAD TWO REASONS IN MIND I WOULD NEED SOMETHING TO KEEP ME UNDER WATER WITH MY LUNGS FULL OF AIR AND I COULD GET OUT QUICKLY IF IT WERE NECESSARY
8088-284756-0075 I HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THE LIVID JAGGED FURROWS IN MERCER'S SIDE QUICKLY AS I SHOT TO THE LADDER SHE WAS THERE BEFORE ME A DIM WAVERING WHITE SHAPE WAITING I PAUSED HOLDING TO A RUNG OF THE LADDER WITH ONE HAND
8088-284756-0076 SHE CAME CLOSER WALKING WITH THE AIRY GRACE I HAD NOTED BEFORE AND MY HEART POUNDED AGAINST MY RIBS AS SHE RAISED ONE LONG SLIM ARM TOWARDS ME
8088-284756-0077 PERHAPS I THOUGHT QUICKLY THIS WAS WITH HER A SIGN OF GREETING I LIFTED MY OWN ARM AND RETURNED THE SALUTATION IF SALUTATION IT WERE AWARE OF A STRANGE RISING AND FALLING SOUND AS OF A DISTANT HUMMING IN MY EARS
8088-284756-0078 THE SOUND CEASED SUDDENLY ON A RISING NOTE AS THOUGH OF INQUIRY AND IT DAWNED ON ME THAT I HAD HEARD THE SPEECH OF THIS STRANGE CREATURE BEFORE I COULD THINK OF A COURSE OF ACTION MY ACHING LUNGS REMINDED ME OF THE NEED OF AIR
8088-284756-0079 AND I RELEASED MY HOLD ON THE LADDER AND LET MY BODY RISE TO THE SURFACE
8088-284756-0080 I LOOKED DOWN THE GIRL WAS WATCHING ME AND THERE WAS NO SMILE ON HER FACE NOW
8088-284756-0081 AS HER FACE CAME CLOSE TO MY OWN I BECAME AWARE OF THE HUMMING CROONING SOUND I HAD HEARD BEFORE LOUDER THIS TIME
8088-284756-0082 I SMILED BACK AT HER AND SHOOK MY HEAD
8088-284756-0083 I POINTED UPWARD FOR I WAS FEELING THE NEED FOR FRESH AIR AGAIN AND SLOWLY MOUNTED THE LADDER THIS TIME SHE DID NOT GRASP ME BUT WATCHED ME INTENTLY AS THOUGH UNDERSTANDING WHAT I DID AND THE REASONS FOR IT
8088-284756-0084 BRING ONE OF YOUR GADGETS OVER HERE MERCER I CALLED ACROSS THE POOL I THINK I'M MAKING PROGRESS GOOD BOY HE CRIED AND CAME RUNNING WITH TWO OF THE ANTENNAE THE LONG INSULATED CORDS TRAILING BEHIND HIM THROUGH THE WATER THE GIRL WATCHED HIM EVIDENT DISLIKE IN HER EYES
8088-284756-0085 THE SALT WATER WOULD SHORT THE ANTENNAE YOU SEE TRY TO GET HER TO WEAR ONE AND THEN YOU GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF WATER AND DON YOURS AND REMEMBER SHE WON'T BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH US BY WORDS WE'LL HAVE TO GET HER TO CONVEY HER THOUGHTS BY MEANS OF MENTAL PICTURES
8088-284756-0086 I'LL TRY TO IMPRESS THAT ON HER UNDERSTAND I NODDED AND PICKED UP ONE OF THE INSTRUMENTS FIRE WHEN READY GRIDLEY I COMMENTED AND SANK AGAIN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL I TOUCHED THE GIRL'S HEAD WITH ONE FINGER AND THEN POINTED TO MY OWN HEAD
8088-284756-0087 TRYING TO CONVEY TO HER THAT SHE COULD GET HER THOUGHTS TO ME THEN I HELD UP THE ANTENNAE AND PLACED IT ON MY OWN HEAD TO SHOW THAT IT COULD NOT HARM HER MY NEXT MOVE WAS TO OFFER HER THE INSTRUMENT MOVING SLOWLY AND SMILING REASSURINGLY
8088-284756-0088 NO MEAN FEAT UNDER WATER SHE HESITATED A MOMENT AND THEN HER EYES FIXED ON MINE
8088-284756-0089 I SMILED AND NODDED AND PRESSED HER SHOULDER IN TOKEN OF FRIENDLY GREETING THEN GESTURING TOWARD MY OWN HEAD AGAIN AND POINTING UPWARD I CLIMBED THE LADDER ALL RIGHT MERCER I SHOUTED START AT ONCE BEFORE SHE GROWS RESTLESS
8088-284756-0090 I'VE ALREADY STARTED HE CALLED BACK AND I HURRIEDLY DONNED MY OWN INSTRUMENT
8088-284756-0091 SO THAT MY HEAD REMAINED OUT OF WATER AND SMILED DOWN AT THE GIRL TOUCHING THE INSTRUMENT ON MY HEAD AND THEN POINTING TO HERS I COULD SENSE MERCER'S THOUGHTS NOW HE WAS PICTURING HIMSELF WALKING LONG THE SHORE WITH THE STORMY OCEAN IN THE BACKGROUND
8088-284756-0092 I SAW HIM RUN UP TO THE POOL AND LIFT THE SLIM PALE FIGURE IN HIS ARMS
8088-284756-0093 I VISUALIZED THEM JUST AS I COULD CLOSE MY EYES AND VISUALIZE FOR EXAMPLE THE FIREPLACE IN THE LIVING ROOM OF MY OWN HOME I LOOKED DOWN AT THE GIRL SHE WAS FROWNING AND HER EYES WERE VERY WIDE
8088-284756-0094 HER HEAD WAS A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE IN THE ATTITUDE OF ONE WHO LISTENS INTENTLY SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY MERCER THOUGHT OUT THE WHOLE STORY OF HIS EXPERIENCES WITH THE GIRL UNTIL SHE HAD PLUNGED INTO THE POOL THEN I SAW AGAIN THE BEACH
8088-284756-0095 I WAS AWARE OF THE SOFT LITTLE TICK IN THE CENTER OF MY BRAIN THAT ANNOUNCED THAT THE SWITCH HAD BEEN MOVED TO ANOTHER CONTACT POINT I GLANCED DOWN AT HER SHE WAS STARING UP AT ME WITH HER GREAT CURIOUS EYES
8088-284756-0096 AND I SENSED THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE INSTRUMENT I WORE THAT SHE WAS THINKING OF ME I SAW MY OWN FEATURES IDEALIZED GLOWING WITH A STRANGE BEAUTY THAT WAS CERTAINLY NONE OF MY OWN I REALIZED THAT I SAW MYSELF IN SHORT AS SHE SAW ME
8088-284756-0097 A DIM BLUISH LIGHT FILTERED DOWN ON A SCENE SUCH AS MORTAL EYES HAVE NEVER SEEN ALL AROUND WERE STRANGE STRUCTURES OF JAGGED CORAL ROUGHLY CIRCULAR AS TO BASE AND ROUNDED ON TOP RESEMBLING VERY MUCH THE IGLOOS OF THE ESKIMOS
8088-284756-0098 THE STRUCTURES VARIED GREATLY IN SIZE AND SEEMED TO BE ARRANGED IN SOME SORT OF REGULAR ORDER LIKE HOUSES ALONG A NARROW STREET
8088-284756-0099 AROUND MANY OF THEM GREW CLUSTERS OF STRANGE AND COLORFUL SEAWEEDS THAT WAVED THEIR BANNERS GENTLY AS THOUGH SOME IMPERCEPTIBLE CURRENT DALLIED WITH THEM IN PASSING HERE AND THERE FIGURES MOVED SLIM WHITE FIGURES THAT STROLLED ALONG THE NARROW STREET
8088-284756-0100 OR AT TIMES SHOT OVERHEAD LIKE VERITABLE TORPEDOES THERE WERE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN MOVING THERE THE MEN WERE BROADER OF SHOULDER AND THEIR HAIR WHICH THEY WORE TO THEIR KNEES WAS SOMEWHAT DARKER IN COLOR THAN THAT OF THE WOMEN BOTH SEXES WERE SLIM
8088-284756-0101 AND THERE WAS A REMARKABLE UNIFORMITY OF SIZE AND APPEARANCE NONE OF THE STRANGE BEINGS WORE GARMENTS OF ANY KIND NOR WERE THEY NECESSARY
8088-284756-0102 THE CLINGING TRESSES WERE CINCTURED AT THE WAIST WITH A SORT OF CORD OF TWISTED ORANGE COLORED MATERIAL AND SOME OF THE YOUNGER WOMEN WORE BANDS OF THE SAME MATERIAL AROUND THEIR BROWS NEAREST OF ALL THE FIGURES WAS THE GIRL WHO WAS VISUALIZING ALL THIS FOR US
8088-284756-0103 SHE WAS WALKING SLOWLY AWAY FROM THE CLUSTER OF CORAL STRUCTURES ONCE OR TWICE SHE PAUSED AND SEEMED TO HOLD CONVERSATION WITH OTHERS OF THE STRANGE PEOPLE BUT EACH TIME SHE MOVED ON THE CORAL STRUCTURES GREW SMALLER AND POORER
8088-284756-0104 FINALLY THE GIRL TROD ALONE ON THE FLOOR OF THE OCEAN BETWEEN GREAT GROWTHS OF KELP AND SEAWEEDS WITH DIM LOOMING MASSES OF FAINTLY TINTED CORAL EVERYWHERE ONCE SHE PASSED CLOSE TO A TILTED RAGGED HULK OF SOME ANCIENT VESSEL
8088-284756-0105 ITS NAKED RIBS PACKED WITH DRIFTED SAND SAUNTERING DREAMILY SHE MOVED AWAY FROM THE ANCIENT DERELICT SUDDENLY A DIM SHADOW SWEPT ACROSS THE SAND AT HER FEET AND SHE ARROWED FROM THE SPOT LIKE A WHITE SLIM METEOR
8088-284756-0106 BUT BEHIND HER DARTED A BLACK AND SWIFTER SHADOW A SHARK LIKE A FLASH SHE TURNED AND FACED THE MONSTER SOMETHING SHE HAD DRAWN FROM HER GIRDLE SHONE PALELY IN HER HAND IT WAS A KNIFE OF WHETTED STONE OR BONE
8088-284756-0107 THE WHITE FIGURE OF THE GIRL SHOT ONWARD THROUGH THE SCARLET FLOOD BLINDED SHE DID NOT SEE THAT THE JUTTING RIBS OF THE ANCIENT SHIP WERE IN HER PATH I SEEMED TO SEE HER CRASH HEAD ON INTO ONE OF THE MASSIVE TIMBERS
8088-284756-0108 AND I CRIED OUT INVOLUNTARILY AND GLANCED DOWN AT THE GIRL IN THE WATER AT MY FEET HER EYES WERE GLOWING SHE KNEW THAT I HAD UNDERSTOOD HAZILY THEN I SEEMED TO VISUALIZE HER BODY FLOATING LIMPLY IN THE WATER IT WAS ALL VERY VAGUE AND INDISTINCT
8088-284756-0109 THE GIRL WAS THINKING OF HER SUFFERING TAKEN OUT OF HER NATIVE ELEMENT
8088-284756-0110 THAT NO DOUBT WAS WHY SHE HATED HIM
8088-284756-0111 ADJUSTED TO HER OWN IDEAS OF WHAT A MAN SHOULD BE I FLUNG THE INSTRUMENT FROM MY HEAD AND DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL I GRIPPED BOTH HER SHOULDERS GENTLY TO EXPRESS MY THANKS AND FRIENDSHIP MY HEART WAS POUNDING
8088-284756-0112 THERE WAS A STRANGE FASCINATION ABOUT THIS GIRL FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA A SUBTLE APPEAL THAT WAS ANSWERED FROM SOME DEEP SUBTERRANEAN CAVERN OF MY BEING I FORGOT FOR THE MOMENT WHO AND WHAT I WAS
8088-284756-0113 HER GREAT WEIRDLY BLUE EYES SEEMED TO BORE INTO MY BRAIN I COULD FEEL THEM THROBBING THERE I FORGOT TIME AND SPACE I SAW ONLY THAT PALE SMILING FACE AND THOSE GREAT DARK EYES
8088-284756-0114 THEN STRANGLING I TORE MYSELF FROM HER EMBRACE AND SHOT TO THE SURFACE COUGHING I CLEARED MY LUNGS OF THE WATER I HAD INHALED I WAS WEAK AND SHAKING WHEN I FINISHED BUT MY HEAD WAS CLEAR THE GRIP OF THE STRANGE FANTASY THAT HAD GRIPPED ME WAS SHAKEN OFF
8088-284756-0115 MERCER WAS BENDING OVER ME SPEAKING SOFTLY I WAS WATCHING OLD MAN HE SAID GENTLY I CAN IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED A MOMENTARY PSYCHIC FUSING OF AN ANCIENT LONG SINCE BROKEN LINK YOU TOGETHER WITH ALL MANKIND CAME UP OUT OF THE SEA
8088-284756-0116 BUT THERE IS NO RETRACING THE WAY I NODDED MY HEAD BOWED ON MY STREAMING CHEST SORRY MERCER I MUTTERED SOMETHING GOT INTO ME THOSE BIG EYES OF HERS SEEMED TO TUG AT THREADS OF MEMORY BURIED I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT
8088-284756-0117 IT HELPED JERK ME BACK TO THE NORMAL YOU'VE GOT YOUR FEET ON THE GROUND AGAIN TAYLOR HE COMMENTED SOOTHINGLY I THINK THERE'S NO DANGER OF YOU LOSING YOUR GRIP ON TERRA FIRMA AGAIN SHALL WE CARRY ON THERE'S MORE YOU'D LIKE TO LEARN THAT YOU THINK SHE CAN GIVE US
8088-284756-0118 I ASKED HESITANTLY I BELIEVE REPLIED MERCER THAT SHE CAN GIVE US THE HISTORY OF HER PEOPLE IF WE CAN ONLY MAKE HER UNDERSTAND WHAT WE WISH GOD IF WE ONLY COULD
8088-284756-0119 WE CAN TRY OLD TIMER I SAID A BIT SHAKENLY MERCER HURRIED BACK TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE POOL AND I ADJUSTED MY HEAD SET AGAIN SMILING DOWN AT THE GIRL
8095-274345-0000 NO SOONER HAD CHARLES TAKEN INTO HIS HANDS THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT THAN HE SHOWED AN IMPATIENCE TO ASSEMBLE THE GREAT COUNCIL OF THE NATION AND HE WOULD GLADLY FOR THE SAKE OF DESPATCH HAVE CALLED TOGETHER THE SAME PARLIAMENT WHICH HAD SITTEN UNDER HIS FATHER
8095-274345-0001 AND WHICH LAY AT THAT TIME UNDER PROROGATION BUT BEING TOLD THAT THIS MEASURE WOULD APPEAR UNUSUAL HE ISSUED WRITS FOR SUMMONING A NEW PARLIAMENT ON THE SEVENTH OF MAY AND IT WAS NOT WITHOUT REGRET THAT THE ARRIVAL OF THE PRINCESS HENRIETTA
8095-274345-0002 UNEXPERIENCED AND IMPOLITIC REGARDED AS SINCERE ALL THE PRAISES AND CARESSES WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN LOADED WHILE ACTIVE IN PROCURING THE RUPTURE WITH THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA AND BESIDES THAT HE LABORED UNDER GREAT NECESSITIES
8095-274345-0003 HE LIGHTLY MENTIONED THE OCCASION WHICH HE HAD FOR SUPPLY HE EMPLOYED NO INTRIGUE TO INFLUENCE THE SUFFRAGES OF THE MEMBERS HE WOULD NOT EVEN ALLOW THE OFFICERS OF THE CROWN WHO HAD SEATS IN THE HOUSE
8095-274345-0004 AND THAT GREAT ANTICIPATIONS WERE LIKEWISE MADE ON THE REVENUES OF THE CROWN THEY WERE NOT IGNORANT THAT CHARLES WAS LOADED WITH A LARGE DEBT CONTRACTED BY HIS FATHER WHO HAD BORROWED MONEY BOTH FROM HIS OWN SUBJECTS AND FROM FOREIGN PRINCES
8095-274345-0005 THEY HAD LEARNED BY EXPERIENCE THAT THE PUBLIC REVENUE COULD WITH DIFFICULTY MAINTAIN THE DIGNITY OF THE CROWN EVEN UNDER THE ORDINARY CHARGES OF GOVERNMENT
8095-274345-0006 THEY WERE SENSIBLE THAT THE PRESENT WAR WAS VERY LATELY THE RESULT OF THEIR OWN IMPORTUNATE APPLICATIONS AND ENTREATIES AND THAT THEY HAD SOLEMNLY ENGAGED TO SUPPORT THEIR SOVEREIGN IN THE MANAGEMENT OF IT
8095-274345-0007 THEY WERE ACQUAINTED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF MILITARY ENTERPRISES DIRECTED AGAINST THE WHOLE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA AGAINST THE KING OF SPAIN POSSESSED OF THE GREATEST RICHES AND MOST EXTENSIVE DOMINIONS OF ANY PRINCE IN EUROPE
8095-274345-0008 AGAINST THE EMPEROR FERDINAND HITHERTO THE MOST FORTUNATE MONARCH OF HIS AGE WHO HAD SUBDUED AND ASTONISHED GERMANY BY THE RAPIDITY OF HIS VICTORIES DEEP IMPRESSIONS THEY SAW MUST BE MADE BY THE ENGLISH SWORD
8095-274345-0009 AND A VIGOROUS OFFENSIVE WAR BE WAGED AGAINST THESE MIGHTY POTENTATES ERE THEY WOULD RESIGN A PRINCIPALITY WHICH THEY HAD NOW FULLY SUBDUED AND WHICH THEY HELD IN SECURE POSSESSION BY ITS BEING SURROUNDED WITH ALL THEIR OTHER TERRITORIES
8095-274345-0010 TO ANSWER THEREFORE ALL THESE GREAT AND IMPORTANT ENDS TO SATISFY THEIR YOUNG KING IN THE FIRST REQUEST WHICH HE MADE THEM TO PROVE THEIR SENSE OF THE MANY ROYAL VIRTUES PARTICULARLY ECONOMY WITH WHICH CHARLES WAS ENDUED
8095-274345-0011 THE HOUSE OF COMMONS CONDUCTED BY THE WISEST AND ABLEST SENATORS THAT HAD EVER FLOURISHED IN ENGLAND THOUGHT PROPER TO CONFER ON THE KING A SUPPLY OF TWO SUBSIDIES
8095-274345-0012 WHICH THE PRESENT CONJUNCTURE COULD SUGGEST TO THEM IT IS NOT TO BE DOUBTED BUT SPLEEN AND ILL WILL AGAINST THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM HAD AN INFLUENCE WITH MANY SO VAST AND RAPID A FORTUNE SO LITTLE MERITED
8095-274345-0013 COULD NOT FAIL TO EXCITE PUBLIC ENVY AND HOWEVER MEN'S HATRED MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED FOR A MOMENT WHILE THE DUKE'S CONDUCT SEEMED TO GRATIFY THEIR PASSIONS AND THEIR PREJUDICES IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM LONG TO PRESERVE THE AFFECTIONS OF THE PEOPLE
8095-274345-0014 HIS INFLUENCE OVER THE MODESTY OF CHARLES EXCEEDED EVEN THAT WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED OVER THE WEAKNESS OF JAMES NOR WAS ANY PUBLIC MEASURE CONDUCTED BUT BY HIS COUNSEL AND DIRECTION
8095-274345-0015 HIS VEHEMENT TEMPER PROMPTED HIM TO RAISE SUDDENLY TO THE HIGHEST ELEVATION HIS FLATTERERS AND DEPENDANTS AND UPON THE LEAST OCCASION OF DISPLEASURE HE THREW THEM DOWN WITH EQUAL IMPETUOSITY AND VIOLENCE IMPLACABLE IN HIS HATRED
8095-274345-0016 FICKLE IN HIS FRIENDSHIPS ALL MEN WERE EITHER REGARDED AS HIS ENEMIES OR DREADED SOON TO BECOME SUCH THE WHOLE POWER OF THE KINGDOM WAS GRASPED BY HIS INSATIABLE HAND WHILE HE BOTH ENGROSSED THE ENTIRE CONFIDENCE OF HIS MASTER
8095-274345-0017 AND HELD INVESTED IN HIS SINGLE PERSON THE MOST CONSIDERABLE OFFICES OF THE CROWN HOWEVER THE ILL HUMOR OF THE COMMONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN INCREASED BY THESE CONSIDERATIONS WE ARE NOT TO SUPPOSE THEM THE SOLE MOTIVES
8095-274345-0018 THE LAST PARLIAMENT OF JAMES AMIDST ALL THEIR JOY AND FESTIVITY HAD GIVEN HIM A SUPPLY VERY DISPROPORTIONED TO HIS DEMAND AND TO THE OCCASION AND AS EVERY HOUSE OF COMMONS WHICH WAS ELECTED DURING FORTY YEARS
8095-274345-0019 SUCCEEDED TO ALL THE PASSIONS AND PRINCIPLES OF THEIR PREDECESSORS WE OUGHT RATHER TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS OBSTINACY FROM THE GENERAL SITUATION OF THE KINGDOM DURING THAT WHOLE PERIOD THAN FROM ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ATTENDED THIS PARTICULAR CONJUNCTURE
8095-274345-0020 THE NATION WAS VERY LITTLE ACCUSTOMED AT THAT TIME TO THE BURDEN OF TAXES AND HAD NEVER OPENED THEIR PURSES IN ANY DEGREE FOR SUPPORTING THEIR SOVEREIGN EVEN ELIZABETH NOTWITHSTANDING HER VIGOR AND FRUGALITY
8095-274345-0021 AND THE NECESSARY WARS IN WHICH SHE WAS ENGAGED HAD REASON TO COMPLAIN OF THE COMMONS IN THIS PARTICULAR NOR COULD THE AUTHORITY OF THAT PRINCESS WHICH WAS OTHERWISE ALMOST ABSOLUTE EVER EXTORT FROM THEM THE REQUISITE SUPPLIES
8095-274345-0022 WOULD NOT AUGMENT THEIR NUMBER IN THE SAME PROPORTION THE PURITANICAL PARTY THOUGH DISGUISED HAD A GREAT AUTHORITY OVER THE KINGDOM AND MANY OF THE LEADERS AMONG THE COMMONS HAD SECRETLY EMBRACED THE RIGID TENETS OF THAT SECT
8095-274345-0023 ALL THESE WERE DISGUSTED WITH THE COURT BOTH BY THE PREVALENCE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF CIVIL LIBERTY ESSENTIAL TO THEIR PARTY AND ON ACCOUNT OF THE RESTRAINT UNDER WHICH THEY WERE HELD BY THE ESTABLISHED HIERARCHY
8095-274345-0024 IN ORDER TO FORTIFY HIMSELF AGAINST THE RESENTMENT OF JAMES BUCKINGHAM HAD AFFECTED POPULARITY AND ENTERED INTO THE CABALS OF THE PURITANS BUT BEING SECURE OF THE CONFIDENCE OF CHARLES HE HAD SINCE ABANDONED THIS PARTY
8095-274345-0025 AND ON THAT ACCOUNT WAS THE MORE EXPOSED TO THEIR HATRED AND RESENTMENT THOUGH THE RELIGIOUS SCHEMES OF MANY OF THE PURITANS WHEN EXPLAINED APPEAR PRETTY FRIVOLOUS WE ARE NOT THENCE TO IMAGINE THAT THEY WERE PURSUED BY NONE BUT PERSONS OF WEAK UNDERSTANDINGS
8095-274345-0026 THE MATCH WITH FRANCE AND THE ARTICLES IN FAVOR OF CATHOLICS WHICH WERE SUSPECTED TO BE IN THE TREATY WERE LIKEWISE CAUSES OF DISGUST TO THIS WHOLE PARTY
8095-274345-0027 THOUGH IT MUST BE REMARKED THAT THE CONNECTIONS WITH THAT CROWN WERE MUCH LESS OBNOXIOUS TO THE PROTESTANTS AND LESS AGREEABLE TO THE CATHOLICS THAN THE ALLIANCE FORMERLY PROJECTED WITH SPAIN AND WERE THEREFORE RECEIVED RATHER WITH PLEASURE THAN DISSATISFACTION
8095-274345-0028 AS BY THE HARDSHIPS WHICH SOME OF THEM HAD UNDERGONE IN PROSECUTION OF THEM AMONG THESE WE MAY MENTION THE NAMES OF SIR EDWARD COKE SIR EDWIN SANDYS SIR ROBERT PHILIPS SIR FRANCIS SEYMOUR
8095-274345-0029 SIR DUDLEY DIGGES SIR JOHN ELLIOT SIR THOMAS WENTWORTH MISTER SELDEN AND MISTER PYM ANIMATED WITH A WARM REGARD TO LIBERTY
8095-274345-0030 OF REDUCING THE PREROGATIVE WITHIN MORE REASONABLE COMPASS THOUGH THEIR ANCESTORS HAD BLINDLY GIVEN WAY TO PRACTICES AND PRECEDENTS FAVORABLE TO KINGLY POWER AND HAD BEEN ABLE NOTWITHSTANDING TO PRESERVE SOME SMALL REMAINS OF LIBERTY
8095-274345-0031 IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THEY THOUGHT WHEN ALL THESE PRETENSIONS WERE METHODISED AND PROSECUTED BY THE INCREASING KNOWLEDGE OF THE AGE TO MAINTAIN ANY SHADOW OF POPULAR GOVERNMENT IN OPPOSITION TO SUCH UNLIMITED AUTHORITY IN THE SOVEREIGN
8095-274345-0032 IT WAS NECESSARY TO FIX A CHOICE EITHER TO ABANDON ENTIRELY THE PRIVILEGES OF THE PEOPLE OR TO SECURE THEM BY FIRMER AND MORE PRECISE BARRIERS THAN THE CONSTITUTION HAD HITHERTO PROVIDED FOR THEM IN THIS DILEMMA
8095-274345-0033 MEN OF SUCH ASPIRING GENIUSES AND SUCH INDEPENDENT FORTUNES COULD NOT LONG DELIBERATE THEY BOLDLY EMBRACED THE SIDE OF FREEDOM AND RESOLVED TO GRANT NO SUPPLIES TO THEIR NECESSITOUS PRINCE WITHOUT EXTORTING CONCESSIONS IN FAVOR OF CIVIL LIBERTY
8095-274345-0034 THE END THEY ESTEEMED BENEFICENT AND NOBLE THE MEANS REGULAR AND CONSTITUTIONAL TO GRANT OR REFUSE SUPPLIES WAS THE UNDOUBTED PRIVILEGE OF THE COMMONS AND AS ALL HUMAN GOVERNMENTS PARTICULARLY THOSE OF A MIXED FRAME
8095-274345-0035 ARE IN CONTINUAL FLUCTUATION IT WAS AS NATURAL IN THEIR OPINION AND ALLOWABLE FOR POPULAR ASSEMBLIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FAVORABLE INCIDENTS IN ORDER TO SECURE THE SUBJECT
8095-274346-0000 CHARLES GAVE THEM A GRACIOUS AND A COMPLIANT ANSWER TO ALL THEIR REMONSTRANCES HE WAS HOWEVER IN HIS HEART EXTREMELY AVERSE TO THESE FURIOUS MEASURES
8095-274346-0001 THOUGH A DETERMINED PROTESTANT BY PRINCIPLE AS WELL AS INCLINATION HE HAD ENTERTAINED NO VIOLENT HORROR AGAINST POPERY AND A LITTLE HUMANITY HE THOUGHT WAS DUE BY THE NATION TO THE RELIGION OF THEIR ANCESTORS
8095-274346-0002 AN ABATEMENT OF THE MORE RIGOROUS LAWS WAS ALL HE INTENDED AND HIS ENGAGEMENTS WITH FRANCE NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THEIR REGULAR EXECUTION HAD NEVER BEEN PROMISED OR EXPECTED REQUIRED OF HIM SOME INDULGENCE
8095-274346-0003 BUT SO UNFORTUNATE WAS THIS PRINCE THAT NO MEASURE EMBRACED DURING HIS WHOLE REIGN WAS EVER ATTENDED WITH MORE UNHAPPY AND MORE FATAL CONSEQUENCES
8095-274346-0004 THE EXTREME RAGE AGAINST POPERY WAS A SURE CHARACTERISTIC OF PURITANISM THE HOUSE OF COMMONS DISCOVERED OTHER INFALLIBLE SYMPTOMS OF THE PREVALENCE OF THAT PARTY
8095-274346-0005 THEY PETITIONED THE KING FOR REPLACING SUCH ABLE CLERGY AS HAD BEEN SILENCED FOR WANT OF CONFORMITY TO THE CEREMONIES THEY ALSO ENACTED LAWS FOR THE STRICT OBSERVANCE OF SUNDAY WHICH THE PURITANS AFFECTED TO CALL THE SABBATH
8095-274346-0006 AND WHICH THEY SANCTIFIED BY THE MOST MELANCHOLY INDOLENCE IT IS TO BE REMARKED THAT THE DIFFERENT APPELLATIONS OF THIS FESTIVAL WERE AT THAT TIME KNOWN SYMBOLS OF THE DIFFERENT PARTIES
8095-274346-0007 THE KING FINDING THAT THE PARLIAMENT WAS RESOLVED TO GRANT HIM NO SUPPLY AND WOULD FURNISH HIM WITH NOTHING BUT EMPTY PROTESTATIONS OF DUTY
8095-274346-0008 WAS INTRUSTED WITH THE COMMAND HE SAILED IMMEDIATELY FOR CADIZ AND FOUND THE BAY FULL OF SPANISH SHIPS OF GREAT VALUE HE EITHER NEGLECTED TO ATTACK THESE SHIPS OR ATTEMPTED IT PREPOSTEROUSLY
8095-274346-0009 THE ARMY WAS LANDED AND A FORT TAKEN BUT THE UNDISCIPLINED SOLDIERS FINDING STORE OF WINE COULD NOT BE RESTRAINED FROM THE UTMOST EXCESSES FURTHER STAY APPEARING FRUITLESS THEY WERE REEMBARKED AND THE FLEET PUT TO SEA
8095-274346-0010 WITH AN INTENTION OF INTERCEPTING THE SPANISH GALLEONS BUT THE PLAGUE HAVING SEIZED THE SEAMEN AND SOLDIERS THEY WERE OBLIGED TO ABANDON ALL HOPES OF THIS PRIZE AND RETURN TO ENGLAND LOUD COMPLAINTS WERE MADE AGAINST THE COURT FOR INTRUSTING SO IMPORTANT A COMMAND
8095-274346-0011 WAS OBLIGED AGAIN TO HAVE RECOURSE TO A PARLIAMENT THOUGH THE ILL SUCCESS OF HIS ENTERPRISES DIMINISHED HIS AUTHORITY AND SHOWED EVERY DAY MORE PLAINLY THE IMPRUDENCE OF THE SPANISH WAR THOUGH THE INCREASE OF HIS NECESSITIES
8095-274346-0012 RENDERED HIM MORE DEPENDENT AND MORE EXPOSED TO THE ENCROACHMENTS OF THE COMMONS HE WAS RESOLVED TO TRY ONCE MORE THAT REGULAR AND CONSTITUTIONAL EXPEDIENT FOR SUPPLY PERHAPS TOO A LITTLE POLITICAL ART WHICH AT THAT TIME HE PRACTISED
8095-274346-0013 WAS MUCH TRUSTED TO HE HAD NAMED FOUR POPULAR LEADERS SHERIFFS OF COUNTIES SIR EDWARD COKE SIR ROBERT PHILIPS SIR THOMAS WENTWORTH AND SIR FRANCIS SEYMOUR AND THOUGH THE QUESTION HAD BEEN FORMERLY MUCH CONTESTED
8095-274346-0014 HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD BY THAT MEANS INCAPACITATED THEM FROM BEING ELECTED MEMBERS BUT HIS INTENTION BEING SO EVIDENT RATHER PUT THE COMMONS MORE UPON THEIR GUARD
8095-274346-0015 ENOW OF PATRIOTS STILL REMAINED TO KEEP UP THE ILL HUMOR OF THE HOUSE AND MEN NEEDED BUT LITTLE INSTRUCTION OR RHETORIC TO RECOMMEND TO THEM PRACTICES
8095-274346-0016 THE SUM WAS LITTLE PROPORTIONED TO THE GREATNESS OF THE OCCASION AND ILL FITTED TO PROMOTE THOSE VIEWS OF SUCCESS AND GLORY FOR WHICH THE YOUNG PRINCE IN HIS FIRST ENTERPRISE SO ARDENTLY LONGED BUT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WAS NOT THE MOST DISAGREEABLE ONE
8095-274346-0017 THE SUPPLY WAS ONLY VOTED BY THE COMMONS THE PASSING OF THAT VOTE INTO A LAW WAS RESERVED TILL THE END OF THE SESSION A CONDITION WAS THEREBY MADE IN A VERY UNDISGUISED MANNER WITH THEIR SOVEREIGN
8095-274346-0018 UNDER COLOR OF REDRESSING GRIEVANCES WHICH DURING THIS SHORT REIGN COULD NOT BE VERY NUMEROUS THEY WERE TO PROCEED IN REGULATING AND CONTROLLING EVERY PART OF GOVERNMENT WHICH DISPLEASED THEM
8095-274346-0019 AND IF THE KING EITHER CUT THEM SHORT IN THIS UNDERTAKING OR REFUSED COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR DEMANDS HE MUST NOT EXPECT ANY SUPPLY FROM THE COMMONS GREAT DISSATISFACTION WAS EXPRESSED BY CHARLES AT A TREATMENT WHICH HE DEEMED SO HARSH AND UNDUTIFUL
8095-274346-0020 BUT HIS URGENT NECESSITIES OBLIGED HIM TO SUBMIT
8095-274346-0021 HAD EXPRESSED ALL DUTY AND OBEDIENCE IN EXPECTATION THAT AN OPPORTUNITY WOULD OFFER OF REINSTATING HIMSELF IN HIS FORMER CREDIT AND AUTHORITY EVEN AFTER CHARLES'S ACCESSION HE DESPAIRED NOT
8095-274346-0022 HE SUBMITTED TO THE KING'S COMMANDS OF REMAINING AT HIS COUNTRY SEAT AND OF ABSENTING HIMSELF FROM PARLIAMENT MANY TRIALS HE MADE TO REGAIN THE GOOD OPINION OF HIS MASTER
8095-274346-0023 BUT FINDING THEM ALL FRUITLESS AND OBSERVING CHARLES TO BE ENTIRELY GOVERNED BY BUCKINGHAM HIS IMPLACABLE ENEMY HE RESOLVED NO LONGER TO KEEP ANY MEASURES WITH THE COURT A NEW SPIRIT HE SAW AND A NEW POWER ARISING IN THE NATION
8095-274346-0024 AND TO THESE HE WAS DETERMINED FOR THE FUTURE TO TRUST FOR HIS SECURITY AND PROTECTION WHEN THE PARLIAMENT WAS SUMMONED CHARLES BY A STRETCH OF PREROGATIVE HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT NO WRIT AS IS CUSTOMARY SHOULD BE SENT TO BRISTOL
8095-274346-0025 THAT NOBLEMAN APPLIED TO THE HOUSE OF LORDS BY PETITION AND CRAVED THEIR GOOD OFFICES WITH THE KING FOR OBTAINING WHAT WAS HIS DUE AS A PEER OF THE REALM HIS WRIT WAS SENT HIM BUT ACCOMPANIED WITH A LETTER FROM THE LORD KEEPER COVENTRY
8095-274346-0026 COMMANDING HIM IN THE KING'S NAME TO ABSENT HIMSELF FROM PARLIAMENT THIS LETTER BRISTOL CONVEYED TO THE LORDS AND ASKED ADVICE HOW TO PROCEED IN SO DELICATE A SITUATION
8095-274346-0027 THE KING'S PROHIBITION WAS WITHDRAWN AND BRISTOL TOOK HIS SEAT PROVOKED AT THESE REPEATED INSTANCES OF VIGOR WHICH THE COURT DENOMINATED CONTUMACY CHARLES ORDERED HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL TO ENTER AN ACCUSATION OF HIGH TREASON AGAINST HIM
8095-274346-0028 BY WAY OF RECRIMINATION BRISTOL ACCUSED BUCKINGHAM OF HIGH TREASON BOTH THE EARL'S DEFENCE OF HIMSELF AND ACCUSATION OF THE DUKE REMAIN AND TOGETHER WITH SOME ORIGINAL LETTERS STILL EXTANT
8095-274346-0029 OF DELIVERING SHIPS TO THE FRENCH KING IN ORDER TO SERVE AGAINST THE HUGONOTS OF BEING EMPLOYED IN THE SALE OF HONORS AND OFFICES OF ACCEPTING EXTENSIVE GRANTS FROM THE CROWN OF PROCURING MANY TITLES OF HONOR FOR HIS KINDRED
8095-274346-0030 AND OF ADMINISTERING PHYSIC TO THE LATE KING WITHOUT ACQUAINTING HIS PHYSICIANS ALL THESE ARTICLES APPEAR FROM COMPARING THE ACCUSATION AND REPLY TO BE EITHER FRIVOLOUS OR FALSE OR BOTH
8095-274346-0031 THE ONLY CHARGE WHICH COULD BE REGARDED AS IMPORTANT WAS THAT HE HAD EXTORTED A SUM OF TEN THOUSAND POUNDS FROM THE EAST INDIA COMPANY AND THAT HE HAD CONFISCATED SOME GOODS BELONGING TO FRENCH MERCHANTS ON PRETENCE OF THEIR BEING THE PROPERTY OF SPANISH
8095-274346-0032 SO THAT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO GIVE A DECISIVE OPINION WITH REGARD TO THESE ARTICLES
8095-274346-0033 BUT SO RIVETTED THROUGHOUT THE NATION WERE THE PREJUDICES WITH REGARD TO SPANISH DECEIT AND FALSEHOOD THAT VERY FEW OF THE COMMONS SEEM AS YET TO HAVE BEEN CONVINCED THAT THEY HAD BEEN SEDUCED BY BUCKINGHAM'S NARRATIVE
8095-274346-0034 A CERTAIN PROOF THAT A DISCOVERY OF THIS NATURE WAS NOT AS IS IMAGINED BY SEVERAL HISTORIANS
8095-274346-0035 THE KING SEEMED DESIROUS OF EMBRACING EVERY OPPORTUNITY BY WHICH HE COULD EXPRESS A CONTEMPT AND DISREGARD FOR THEM NO ONE WAS AT THAT TIME SUFFICIENTLY SENSIBLE OF THE GREAT WEIGHT WHICH THE COMMONS BORE IN THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION
8095-274346-0036 THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND HAD NEVER HITHERTO AFFORDED ONE INSTANCE WHERE ANY GREAT MOVEMENT OR REVOLUTION HAD PROCEEDED FROM THE LOWER HOUSE AND AS THEIR RANK BOTH CONSIDERED IN A BODY AND AS INDIVIDUALS WAS BUT THE SECOND IN THE KINGDOM
8095-274346-0037 NOTHING LESS THAN FATAL EXPERIENCE COULD ENGAGE THE ENGLISH PRINCES TO PAY A DUE REGARD TO THE INCLINATIONS OF THAT FORMIDABLE ASSEMBLY THE EARL OF SUFFOLK CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE DYING ABOUT THIS TIME
8095-274346-0038 BUCKINGHAM THOUGH LYING UNDER IMPEACHMENT WAS YET BY MEANS OF COURT INTEREST CHOSEN IN HIS PLACE THE COMMONS RESENTED AND LOUDLY COMPLAINED OF THIS AFFRONT AND THE MORE TO ENRAGE THEM THE KING HIMSELF WROTE A LETTER TO THE UNIVERSITY EXTOLLING THE DUKE
8095-274346-0039 YET LEST ANY AMBIGUITY SHOULD REMAIN SIR DUDLEY CARLETON VICE CHAMBERLAIN TOOK CARE TO EXPLAIN IT I PRAY YOU CONSIDER SAID HE WHAT THESE NEW COUNSELS ARE OR MAY BE I FEAR TO DECLARE THOSE THAT I CONCEIVE
8095-274346-0040 IN ALL CHRISTIAN KINGDOMS YOU KNOW THAT PARLIAMENTS WERE IN USE ANCIENTLY BY WHICH THOSE KINGDOMS WERE GOVERNED IN A MOST FLOURISHING MANNER UNTIL THE MONARCHS BEGAN TO KNOW THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND SEEING THE TURBULENT SPIRIT OF THEIR PARLIAMENTS AT LENGTH
8095-274346-0041 THEY BY LITTLE AND LITTLE BEGAN TO STAND ON THEIR PREROGATIVES AND AT LAST OVERTHREW THE PARLIAMENTS THROUGHOUT CHRISTENDOM
8095-274346-0042 WHICH BRINGETH SUCH HAPPINESS TO THIS NATION AND MAKES US ENVIED OF ALL OTHERS WHILE THERE IS THIS SWEETNESS BETWEEN HIS MAJESTY AND THE COMMONS LEST WE LOSE THE REPUTE OF A FREE PEOPLE BY OUR TURBULENCY IN PARLIAMENT
8095-274346-0043 THESE IMPRUDENT SUGGESTIONS RATHER GAVE WARNING THAN STRUCK TERROR A PRECARIOUS LIBERTY THE COMMONS THOUGHT WHICH WAS TO BE PRESERVED BY UNLIMITED COMPLAISANCE WAS NO LIBERTY AT ALL AND IT WAS NECESSARY WHILE YET IN THEIR POWER
8095-274346-0044 TO SECURE THE CONSTITUTION BY SUCH INVINCIBLE BARRIERS THAT NO KING OR MINISTER SHOULD EVER FOR THE FUTURE DARE TO SPEAK SUCH A LANGUAGE TO ANY PARLIAMENT OR EVEN ENTERTAIN SUCH A PROJECT AGAINST THEM
8095-274346-0045 THE COMMONS IMMEDIATELY DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD PROCEED NO FURTHER UPON BUSINESS TILL THEY HAD SATISFACTION IN THEIR PRIVILEGES CHARLES ALLEGED AS THE REASON OF THIS MEASURE CERTAIN SEDITIOUS EXPRESSIONS WHICH HE SAID HAD IN THEIR ACCUSATION OF THE DUKE
8095-274346-0046 DROPPED FROM THESE MEMBERS UPON INQUIRY IT APPEARED THAT NO SUCH EXPRESSIONS HAD BEEN USED THE MEMBERS WERE RELEASED AND THE KING REAPED NO OTHER BENEFIT FROM THIS ATTEMPT THAN TO EXASPERATE THE HOUSE STILL
8095-274346-0047 AND TO SHOW SOME DEGREE OF PRECIPITANCY AND INDISCRETION MOVED BY THIS EXAMPLE THE HOUSE OF PEERS WERE ROUSED FROM THEIR INACTIVITY AND CLAIMED LIBERTY FOR THE EARL OF ARUNDEL WHO HAD BEEN LATELY CONFINED IN THE TOWER
8095-274346-0048 AFTER MANY FRUITLESS EVASIONS THE KING
8095-274346-0049 HIS MOTHER WHO HAD GREAT INFLUENCE OVER HIM WAS A PROFESSED CATHOLIC HIS WIFE WAS NOT FREE FROM SUSPICION
8095-274346-0050 SO VIOLENT WAS THE BIGOTRY OF THE TIMES THAT IT WAS THOUGHT A SUFFICIENT REASON FOR DISQUALIFYING ANY ONE FROM HOLDING AN OFFICE
8095-274346-0051 THIS ARTICLE TOGETHER WITH THE NEW IMPOSITIONS LAID ON MERCHANDISE BY JAMES CONSTITUTED NEAR HALF OF THE CROWN REVENUES AND BY DEPRIVING THE KING OF THESE RESOURCES THEY WOULD HAVE REDUCED HIM TO TOTAL SUBJECTION AND DEPENDENCE
8095-274346-0052 WHILE THEY RETAINED SUCH A PLEDGE BESIDES THE SUPPLY ALREADY PROMISED THEY WERE SURE THAT NOTHING COULD BE REFUSED THEM THOUGH AFTER CANVASSING THE MATTER NEAR THREE NINTHS THEY FOUND THEMSELVES UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF FIXING ANY LEGAL CRIME UPON THE DUKE
8095-274346-0053 THE SMALLEST APPEARANCE OF GUILT COULD NOT BE FIXED UPON HIM WHAT IDEA HE ASKED MUST ALL MANKIND ENTERTAIN OF HIS HONOR SHOULD HE SACRIFICE HIS INNOCENT FRIEND TO PECUNIARY CONSIDERATIONS WHAT FURTHER AUTHORITY SHOULD HE RETAIN IN THE NATION
8095-274346-0054 WERE HE CAPABLE IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN TO GIVE IN SO SIGNAL AN INSTANCE SUCH MATTER OF TRIUMPH TO HIS ENEMIES AND DISCOURAGEMENT TO HIS ADHERENTS TO DAY THE COMMONS PRETEND TO WREST HIS MINISTER FROM HIM
8095-274346-0055 TO MORROW THEY WILL ATTACK SOME BRANCH OF HIS PREROGATIVE BY THEIR REMONSTRANCES AND PROMISES AND PROTESTATIONS THEY HAD ENGAGED THE CROWN IN A WAR AS SOON AS THEY SAW A RETREAT IMPOSSIBLE
8095-274346-0056 WITHOUT WAITING FOR NEW INCIDENTS WITHOUT COVERING THEMSELVES WITH NEW PRETENCES THEY IMMEDIATELY DESERTED HIM AND REFUSED HIM ALL REASONABLE SUPPLY IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THEY DESIRED NOTHING SO MUCH AS TO SEE HIM PLUNGED IN INEXTRICABLE DIFFICULTIES
8095-274346-0057 OF WHICH THEY INTENDED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE TO SUCH DEEP PERFIDY TO SUCH UNBOUNDED USURPATIONS IT WAS NECESSARY TO OPPOSE A PROPER FIRMNESS AND RESOLUTION
8095-274348-0000 AND WHO FROM A PRIVATE STATION HAD MOUNTED IN THE EARLIEST YOUTH
8095-274348-0001 HE DARED TO CARRY HIS AMBITIOUS ADDRESSES TO THE QUEEN HERSELF AND HE FAILED NOT TO MAKE IMPRESSION ON A HEART NOT UNDISPOSED TO THE TENDER PASSIONS THAT ATTACHMENT AT LEAST OF THE MIND WHICH APPEARS SO DELICIOUS AND IS SO DANGEROUS
8095-274348-0002 SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED BY THE PRINCESS AND THE DUKE PRESUMED SO FAR ON HER GOOD GRACES THAT AFTER HIS DEPARTURE HE SECRETLY RETURNED UPON SOME PRETENCE AND PAYING A VISIT TO THE QUEEN
8095-274348-0003 WAS DISMISSED WITH A REPROOF WHICH SAVORED MORE OF KINDNESS THAN OF ANGER INFORMATION OF THIS CORRESPONDENCE WAS SOON CARRIED TO RICHELIEU THE VIGILANCE OF THAT MINISTER WAS HERE FURTHER ROUSED BY JEALOUSY
8095-274348-0004 HE TOO EITHER FROM VANITY OR POLITICS HAD VENTURED TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO THE QUEEN BUT A PRIEST PAST MIDDLE AGE OF A SEVERE CHARACTER AND OCCUPIED IN THE MOST EXTENSIVE PLANS OF AMBITION OR VENGEANCE
8095-274348-0005 ENTIRELY DISPOSED TO GAYETY AND GALLANTRY THE CARDINAL'S DISAPPOINTMENT STRONGLY INCLINED HIM TO COUNTERWORK THE AMOROUS PROJECTS OF HIS RIVAL WHEN THE DUKE WAS MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR A NEW EMBASSY TO PARIS
8095-274348-0006 A MESSAGE WAS SENT HIM FROM LOUIS THAT HE MUST NOT THINK OF SUCH A JOURNEY IN A ROMANTIC PASSION HE SWORE THAT HE WOULD SEE THE QUEEN IN SPITE OF ALL THE POWER OF FRANCE
8095-274348-0007 AND FROM THAT MOMENT HE DETERMINED TO ENGAGE ENGLAND IN A WAR WITH THAT KINGDOM HE FIRST TOOK ADVANTAGE OF SOME QUARRELS EXCITED BY THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND'S ATTENDANTS AND HE PERSUADED CHARLES TO DISMISS AT ONCE ALL HER FRENCH SERVANTS
8095-274348-0008 CONTRARY TO THE ARTICLES OF THE MARRIAGE TREATY HE ENCOURAGED THE ENGLISH SHIPS OF WAR AND PRIVATEERS TO SEIZE VESSELS BELONGING TO FRENCH MERCHANTS
8095-274348-0009 AND STRONGLY SOLICITED CHARLES TO EMBRACE THE PROTECTION OF THESE DISTRESSED RELIGIONISTS HE REPRESENTED THAT AFTER THE INHABITANTS OF ROCHELLE HAD BEEN REPRESSED BY THE COMBINED SQUADRONS OF ENGLAND AND HOLLAND
8095-274348-0010 AFTER PEACE WAS CONCLUDED WITH THE FRENCH KING UNDER CHARLES'S MEDIATION THE AMBITIOUS CARDINAL WAS STILL MEDITATING THE DESTRUCTION OF THE HUGONOTS THAT PREPARATIONS WERE SILENTLY MAKING IN EVERY PROVINCE OF FRANCE FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THEIR RELIGION
8095-274348-0011 THAT FORTS WERE ERECTED IN ORDER TO BRIDLE ROCHELLE THE MOST CONSIDERABLE BULWARK OF THE PROTESTANTS THAT THE REFORMED IN FRANCE CAST THEIR EYES ON CHARLES AS THE HEAD OF THEIR FAITH
8095-274348-0012 AND CONSIDERED HIM AS A PRINCE ENGAGED BY INTEREST AS WELL AS INCLINATION TO SUPPORT THEM THAT SO LONG AS THEIR PARTY SUBSISTED CHARLES MIGHT RELY ON THEIR ATTACHMENT AS MUCH AS ON THAT OF HIS OWN SUBJECTS BUT IF THEIR LIBERTIES WERE ONCE RAVISHED FROM THEM
8095-274348-0013 THE POWER OF FRANCE FREED FROM THIS IMPEDIMENT WOULD SOON BECOME FORMIDABLE TO ENGLAND AND TO ALL THE NEIGHBORING NATIONS THOUGH CHARLES PROBABLY BORE BUT SMALL FAVOR TO THE HUGONOTS WHO SO MUCH RESEMBLED THE PURITANS IN DISCIPLINE AND WORSHIP
8095-274348-0014 IN RELIGION AND POLITICS HE YET ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE GAINED BY THESE ARGUMENTS ENFORCED BY THE SOLICITATIONS OF BUCKINGHAM A FLEET OF A HUNDRED SAIL AND AN ARMY OF SEVEN THOUSAND MEN WERE FITTED OUT FOR THE INVASION OF FRANCE
8095-274348-0015 AND BOTH OF THEM INTRUSTED TO THE COMMAND OF THE DUKE WHO WAS ALTOGETHER UNACQUAINTED BOTH WITH LAND AND SEA SERVICE THE FLEET APPEARED BEFORE ROCHELLE BUT SO ILL CONCERTED WERE BUCKINGHAM'S MEASURES THAT THE INHABITANTS OF THAT CITY
8095-274348-0016 SHUT THEIR GATES AND REFUSED TO ADMIT ALLIES OF WHOSE COMING THEY WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY INFORMED
8095-274348-0017 HASTENED THE VENGEANCE OF THEIR MASTER EXHAUSTED THEIR PROVISIONS IN SUPPLYING THEIR ALLIES AND WERE THREATENED WITH AN IMMEDIATE SIEGE
8098-275181-0000 THEIR SHARP CUR LIKE BARKS USED OFTEN TO ROUSE US AND OF A DARK EVENING WE WOULD HEAR THEM OUT IN THE FIELDS MOUSING AROUND THE STONE HEAPS MAKING A QUEER SQUEAKING SOUND LIKE A MOUSE
8098-275181-0001 TO CALL THE REAL MICE OUT OF THEIR GRASS NESTS INSIDE THE STONE HEAPS THIS INDEED IS A FAVORITE TRICK OF REYNARD AT THE TIME OF MY STORY MY FRIEND TOM EDWARDS TEN YEARS OF AGE
8098-275181-0002 AND MYSELF WERE IN THE TURKEY BUSINESS EQUAL PARTNERS WE OWNED A FLOCK OF THIRTY ONE TURKEYS THESE ROOSTED BY NIGHT IN A LARGE BUTTERNUT TREE IN FRONT OF TOM'S HOUSE IN THE VERY TOP OF IT
8098-275181-0003 AND BY DAY THEY WANDERED ABOUT THE EDGES OF THE CLEARINGS IN QUEST OF BEECH NUTS WHICH WERE VERY PLENTIFUL THAT FALL ALL WENT WELL TILL THE LAST WEEK IN OCTOBER WHEN ON TAKING THE CENSUS ONE MORNING A TURKEY WAS FOUND TO BE MISSING
8098-275181-0004 THE THIRTY ONE HAD BECOME THIRTY SINCE NIGHTFALL THE PREVIOUS EVENING IT WAS THE FIRST ONE WE HAD LOST WE PROCEEDED TO LOOK FOR TRACES OUR SUSPICIONS WERE DIVIDED
8098-275181-0005 TOM THOUGHT IT WAS THE TWOMBLY BOYS NEFARIOUS SAM IN PARTICULAR I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN OWL BUT UNDER THE TREE IN THE SOFT DIRT WHERE THE POTATOES HAD RECENTLY BEEN DUG WE FOUND FOX TRACKS
8098-275181-0006 AND TWO OR THREE OMINOUS LITTLE WADS OF FEATHERS WITH ONE LONG TAIL FEATHER ADRIFT THEREUPON WE CONCLUDED THAT THE TURKEY HAD ACCIDENTALLY FALLEN DOWN OUT OF THE BUTTERNUT HAD A FIT PERHAPS
8098-275181-0007 AND A CASUALTY SUCH AS TURKEY RAISERS ARE UNAVOIDABLY HEIRS TO AND WE BORE OUR LOSS WITH RESIGNATION WE WERE GLAD TO REMEMBER THAT TURKEYS DID NOT OFTEN FALL OFF THEIR ROOSTS
8098-275181-0008 THIS THEORY RECEIVED SOMETHING OF A CHECK WHEN OUR FLOCK COUNTED ONLY TWENTY NINE THE NEXT MORNING THERE WERE MORE FOX TRACKS AND A GREAT MANY MORE FEATHERS UNDER THE TREE THIS PUT A NEW AND ALTOGETHER UGLY ASPECT ON THE MATTER
8098-275181-0009 NO ALGEBRA WAS NEEDED TO FIGURE THE OUTCOME OF THE TURKEY BUSINESS AT THIS RATE TOGETHER WITH OUR PROSPECTIVE PROFITS IN THE LIGHT OF THIS NEW FACT IT WAS CLEAR THAT SOMETHING MUST BE DONE AND AT ONCE TOO
8098-275181-0010 OR RUIN WOULD SWALLOW UP THE POULTRY FIRM RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY WE ATTRIBUTED THE MISCHIEF TO A CERTAIN SILVER GRAY THAT HAD SEVERAL TIMES BEEN SEEN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT AUTUMN
8098-275181-0011 IT WOULD TAKE FAR TOO MUCH SPACE TO RELATE IN DETAIL THE PLANS WE LAID AND PUT IN EXECUTION TO CATCH THAT FOX DURING THE NEXT TWO WEEKS I RECOLLECT THAT WE SET THREE TRAPS FOR HIM TO NO PURPOSE
8098-275181-0012 HAD SUCCEEDED IN GETTING TWO MORE OF THE TURKEYS HEROES IT IS SAID ARE BORN OF GREAT CRISES THIS DILEMMA OF OURS DEVELOPED TOM'S GENIUS I'LL HAVE THAT FOX HE SAID WHEN THE TRAPS FAILED
8098-275181-0013 EACH A WAD OF FINE DRY GRASS AS LARGE AS A QUART BOX THESE WERE GATHERED UP AND FILLED THE GREAT BASKET THERE SAID HE TRIUMPHANTLY DON'T THEM SMELL MOUSEY THEY DID CERTAINLY
8098-275181-0014 THEY SAVORED AS STRONGLY OF MICE AS TOM'S QUESTION OF BAD GRAMMAR AND DON'T FOXES CATCH MICE DEMANDED TOM CONFIDENTLY YES BUT I DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S GOING TO CATCH THE FOX I SAID
8098-275181-0015 WELL LOOK HERE THEN I'LL SHOW YE SAID HE
8098-275181-0016 AND YOU WAS PROWLING AROUND THE FIELDS GO OFF NOW OUT THERE BY THAT STUMP FULL OF WONDER AND CURIOSITY I RETIRED TO THE STUMP TOM MEANTIME TURNED OUT THE MASS OF NESTS
8098-275181-0017 AND WITH IT COMPLETELY COVERED HIMSELF THE PILE NOW RESEMBLED AN ENORMOUS MOUSE NEST OR RATHER A SMALL HAY COCK
8098-275181-0018 INSIDE THE NEST EVIDENTLY THERE WERE MICE IN IT AND FEELING MY CHARACTER AS FOX AT STAKE I AT ONCE TROTTED FORWARD THEN CREPT UP AND AS THE RUSTLING AND SQUEAKING CONTINUED MADE A POUNCE INTO THE GRASS
8098-275181-0019 AS I HAD HEARD IT SAID THAT FOXES DID WHEN MOUSING INSTANTLY TWO SPRY BROWN HANDS FROM OUT THE NEST CLUTCHED ME WITH A MOST VENGEFUL GRIP AS A FOX I STRUGGLED TREMENDOUSLY
8098-275181-0020 THEN IN DUMB SHOW KNOCKED MY HEAD WITH A STONE D'YE SEE NOW HE DEMANDED I SAW BUT A FOX WOULD BITE YOU I OBJECTED LET HIM BITE SAID TOM
8098-275181-0021 WITH THE DUSK WE STOLE OUT INTO THE FIELD WHERE THE STONE HEAPS WERE AND WHERE WE HAD OFTENEST HEARD FOXES BARK SELECTING A NOOK IN THE EDGE OF A CLUMP OF RASPBERRY BRIARS WHICH GREW ABOUT A GREAT PINE STUMP
8098-275181-0022 TOM LAY DOWN AND I COVERED HIM UP COMPLETELY WITH THE CONTENTS OF THE BIG BASKET HE THEN PRACTICED SQUEAKING AND RUSTLING SEVERAL TIMES TO BE SURE THAT ALL WAS IN GOOD TRIM HIS SQUEAKS WERE PERFECT SUCCESSES
8098-275181-0023 MADE BY SUCKING THE AIR SHARPLY BETWIXT HIS TEETH NOW BE OFF SAID TOM AND DON'T COME POKING AROUND NOR GET IN SIGHT TILL YOU HEAR ME HOLLER
8098-275181-0024 AND BEING AMIDST NICE COZY STRAW I PRESENTLY WENT TO SLEEP QUITE UNINTENTIONALLY I MUST HAVE SLEPT SOME TIME THOUGH IT SEEMED TO ME BUT A VERY FEW MINUTES WHAT WOKE ME WAS A NOISE A SHARP SUPPRESSED YELP
8098-275181-0025 IT TOOK ME A MOMENT TO UNDERSTAND WHERE I WAS AND WHY I WAS THERE A SOUND OF SCUFFLING AND TUMBLING ON THE GROUND AT SOME DISTANCE ASSISTED MY WANDERING WITS AND I RUSHED OUT OF THE BARN AND RAN TOWARD THE FIELD
8098-275181-0026 AS I RAN TWO OR THREE DULL WHACKS CAME TO MY EAR GOT HIM TOM I SHOUTED RUSHING UP TOM WAS HOLDING AND SQUEEZING ONE OF HIS HANDS WITH THE OTHER AND SHAKING IT VIOLENTLY
8098-275181-0027 HE SAID NOT A WORD AND LEFT ME TO POKE ABOUT AND STUMBLE ON THE LIMP WARM CARCASS OF A LARGE FOX THAT LAY NEAR BITE YE I EXCLAIMED AFTER SATISFYING MYSELF THAT THE FOX WAS DEAD SOME SAID TOM
8098-275181-0028 AND THAT WAS ALL I COULD GET FROM HIM THAT NIGHT WE TOOK THE FOX TO THE HOUSE AND LIGHTED A CANDLE IT WAS THE SILVER GRAY TOM WASHED HIS BITE IN COLD WATER AND WENT TO BED
8098-275181-0029 HIS LEFT HAND WAS BITTEN THROUGH THE PALM AND BADLY SWOLLEN THERE WAS ALSO A DEEP BITE IN THE FLESHY PART OF HIS RIGHT ARM JUST BELOW THE ELBOW SEVERAL MINOR NIPS IN HIS LEFT LEG ABOVE THE KNEE AND A RAGGED GRAB
8098-275181-0030 THESE NUMEROUS BITES HOWEVER WERE FOLLOWED BY NO SERIOUS ILL EFFECTS THE NEXT DAY TOM TOLD ME THAT THE FOX HAD SUDDENLY PLUNGED INTO THE GRASS THAT HE HAD CAUGHT HOLD OF ONE OF ITS HIND LEGS
8098-275181-0031 I JUST DETERMINED TO HAVE IT OUT WITH HIM CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT A FOX IS A VERY ACTIVE SHARP BITING ANIMAL AND THAT THIS WAS AN UNUSUALLY LARGE MALE I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT TOM GOT OFF VERY WELL
8098-275181-0032 I DO NOT THINK THAT HE EVER CARED TO MAKE A FOX TRAP OF HIMSELF AGAIN HOWEVER WE SOLD THE FOX SKIN IN THE VILLAGE AND RECEIVED THIRTEEN DOLLARS FOR IT WHEREAS A COMMON RED FOX SKIN IS WORTH NO MORE THAN THREE DOLLARS
8098-275181-0033 HOW OR BY WHAT WILES THAT FOX GOT THE TURKEYS OUT OF THE HIGH BUTTERNUT IS A SECRET
8098-278252-0000 MUCH POMP AND SEVERAL CIRCUMSTANCES FROM WILLOUGHBY WE WENT TO CLEVELAND MY ROUTE THROUGH THE BEAUTIFUL CITY LAY ALONG ONE OF THE FINEST RESIDENCE STREETS IN AMERICA THE FAMOUS EUCLID AVENUE
8098-278252-0001 FROM THERE WE MARCHED TO SUPERIOR STREET WHERE CHEERS GREETED US ON EVERY HAND THE PAPERS HAD HERALDED MY ADVENT AND AS IN THE OTHER TOWNS AND CITIES
8098-278252-0002 THE NEWSPAPER ARTISTS HAD TAXED THEIR IMAGINATIONS TO PICTURE POD AND MAC
8098-278252-0003 AND WHEN I RODE OUT ON TO THE STAGE THE HOUSE SHOOK WITH LAUGHTER AND CHEERS I MADE A SHORT ADDRESS AND ANNOUNCED THAT I WOULD SELL PHOTOS OF MAC A'RONY AND HIS MASTER AT THE DOOR
8098-278252-0004 THAT THEATRE PUT ME WAY AHEAD FINANCIALLY THURSDAY MORNING I CALLED ON THE MAYOR MARK HANNA AND SENATOR GARFIELD AND ADDED THE AUTOGRAPHS OF ALL THREE TO MY ALBUM
8098-278252-0005 MISTER GARFIELD INVITED ME TO ATTEND THE WEEKLY DINNER AND RECEPTION OF THE BEER AND SKITTLES CLUB THAT EVENING I WENT AND ENJOYED MYSELF
8098-278252-0006 ONLY MAKING THIRTEEN MILES
8098-278252-0007 A MILE BEYOND TWO MEN REMINDED ME IT WAS A VERY WINTRY DAY THEN A WOMAN DROVE PAST AND TOSSED ME THE COMFORTING REMINDER DON'T YOU FIND IT AWFULLY COLD I DID NOT REPLY TO THE LAST TWO
8098-278252-0008 TWENTY MINUTES LATER A BOY FROM A COZY HOME YELLED TO ME I HAD PASSED TO SOME DISTANCE AND DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT SOUNDED LIKE
8098-278252-0009 I HESITATED A MOMENT IN THE BITING WIND THEN RETRACED MY STEPS AND CALLED TO THE LAD WHAT'S THAT YOU SAID
8098-278252-0010 YELLED THE SCAMP I WAS MAD ENOUGH TO UNLOAD MY WINCHESTER BUT I DIDN'T
8098-278252-0011 RUBBED MY EARS AND CONTINUED MY JOURNEY LIKE AN ICE COVERED VOLCANO A MILE BEYOND A WAGON WITH A FAMILY IN IT PASSED ME AND THE MAN SAID COLD MY FRIEND AT DUSK A FARMER INQUIRED
8098-278252-0012 I SHOUTED SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE THE RIG STOPPED A FUR CLAD HEAD STUCK OUT TO ONE SIDE AND A MALE VOICE CALLED

8098-278252-0019 WHERE HE ROYALLY ENTERTAINED ME AND MY ANIMALS THE PAGEANT THAT CELEBRATED THE DEPARTURE OF WILLIAM MC KINLEY TO THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT WAS A FAIR ESTIMATE OF THE REGARD IN WHICH HIS FELLOW CITIZENS HELD HIM

8098-278252-0023 CANNON BOOMED STEAM WHISTLES SHRIEKED AND THE CITIZENS SHOUTED AND HURRAHED AND I WAS GLAD MAC WAS NOT WITH ME TO ADD HIS SALUTE
8098-278252-0024 I SAW A MEADOW LARK ON THE FIRST OF MARCH THIS DAY I HEARD BLUE BIRDS AND ROBINS SINGING GAILY IT LOOKED AS THOUGH SPRING HAD COME TO STAY I EXPECTED THAT DAY TO REACH DALTON ONLY EIGHT MILES DISTANT
8098-278252-0025 THAT ONCE I WAS COMPELLED TO CRAWL ALONG THE TOP OF A RAIL FENCE TWO HUNDRED FEET AND MORE AND DRAG MY JACKASS AT DUSK I HAD COVERED ONLY THREE MILES THEN I SOUGHT LODGINGS
8098-278252-0026 A STORE LOOMED INTO VIEW SHORTLY I WAS ELATED ACCORDING TO THE SIGN OVER THE ENTRANCE THE YOUNGER GENERATION WAS THE RULING POWER IT READ HEZEKIAH BRIMLEY AND FATHER
8098-278252-0027 I MADE FOR HEZ HE SAID THE TOWN HADN'T REACHED THE HOTEL STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT YET BUT THAT HE WOULD GLADLY TAKE ME IN PROVIDED I'D SLEEP WITH HIS CLERK IN THE GARRET
8098-278252-0028 I FOUND THE STORE FULL OF LOUNGERS WHO PATRONIZED THE CHAIRS SOAP AND STARCH BOXES MACKEREL KITS AND COUNTER FORMING A SILENT CIRCLE ROUND A TOWERING STOVE IN THE CENTER
8098-278252-0029 THE VILLAGE TREASURER WORE A BOILED SHIRT AND BRASS COLLAR BUTTONS BUT NO COLLAR OR COAT HIS COMPANIONS WERE GENERALLY ATTIRED IN FLANNEL SHIRTS OF DIFFERENT HUES AND PATTERNS
8098-278252-0030 AND FELT BOOTS ENCASED IN HEAVY OVERSHOES THESE RURAL MEN EYED ME WITH SUSPICION UNTIL I MENTIONED MAC A'RONY THEN THERE WAS A RUSH TO THE DOOR AS IT SWUNG OPEN IN LEAPED MY GREAT DOG

8098-278252-0032 AND ONLY THIS MORNING ATE TWO CHICKENS AND A DUCK AND CHASED A FARMER INTO HIS HAY LOFT BUT HE DOESN'T BITE MY STATEMENT HAD A SENSATIONAL EFFECT ON THE ASSEMBLY WHO ONE BY ONE SNEAKED OUT OF THE DOOR
8098-278252-0033 LEAVING HEZ AND HIS ODD GUEST ALONE AS SOON AS THE JUNIOR MEMBER HEZ'S FATHER CAME IN HEZ TOOK MY ANIMALS TO THE SHED AND FED THEM AND TOLD ME TO HELP MYSELF TO THE BEST IN THE STORE
8098-278252-0034 A PINT OF CORNED OYSTERS LIGHT WEIGHT SOME CRACKERS AND LEAF LARD TO TAKE THE PLACE OF BUTTER AND A CAKE OF BITTER CHOCOLATE I LEFT A FEW THINGS UNMOLESTED SUCH AS SOAP
8098-278252-0035 TO BE GOOD CHOCOLATE MUST BE WELL DISSOLVED NO POT WAS TO BE HAD SAVE A FLOWER POT WITH A HOLE IN THE BOTTOM A GREAT IDEA POPPED INTO MY HEAD
8098-278252-0036 DID YOU EVER TRY IT IF NOT DON'T LET YOUR CURIOSITY GET THE BETTER OF YOU CHOCOLATE BELONGS TO THE BEAN FAMILY AND THE BEAN IS A VERY TREACHEROUS THING
8098-278252-0037 CHOCOLATE BEAN CASTOR OIL BEAN PORK BEAN AND ALL KINDS I FIRST ATE THE CAKE OF CHOCOLATE THEN SOME SUGAR AND DRANK TWO DIPPERSFUL OF HOT WATER THEN SHOOK MYSELF
8098-278252-0038 THAT MIXTURE MIGHT SUIT MY STOMACH I THOUGHT BUT IT DOESN'T DELIGHT MY PALATE I FELT I HAD EATEN A HEAVY MEAL UNWITTINGLY AND SAT DOWN TO DIGEST IT I HADN'T SAT LONG BEFORE I FELT MYSELF SWELLING
8098-278252-0039 SOMETHING WITHIN WAS SIZZLING AND BREWING AND STEAMING GAS AND STEAM CHOKED ME I WAS SURE THERE WAS GOING TO BE A DEMONSTRATION IN MY HONOR THAT I HAD NOT BARGAINED FOR THE YEAST CAKE CAME TO MIND THEN I KNEW THE CAUSE
8098-278252-0040 AFTER WHICH I EXCUSED MYSELF TO THE CLERK AND WENT TO BED AND DREAMED I WAS BEING CREMATED ALIVE
8098-278278-0000 BY MAC A'RONY YOU DO ILL TO TEACH THE CHILD SUCH WORDS HE TEACHES HIM TO KICK AND TO HACK WHICH THEY'LL DO FAST ENOUGH OF THEMSELVES AND TO CALL HORUM FYE UPON YOU
8098-278278-0001 MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR FREQUENTLY SINCE CROSSING THE MISSISSIPPI POD HAD RECEIVED LETTERS FROM PROUD PARENTS INFORMING HIM THAT THEY HAD NAMED THEIR LATEST BOY AFTER HIM
8098-278278-0002 AT THAT TIME IN CRIPPLE CREEK SEVERAL BOYS RANGING FROM A DAY TO SIX WEEKS OLD WHOSE DESTINIES WERE THOUGHT TO BE PROMISING WERE AFFLICTED WITH MY MASTER'S PONDEROUS NAME
8098-278278-0003 A LITTLE GREEN EYED IRISH GIRL FIVE DAYS OLD WAS NAMED PYTHAGORINA PODINA MULGARRY
8098-278278-0004 THE HAPPY FATHER CALLED PERSONALLY ON POD AND ASKED HIM TO ACT AS GODFATHER AT THE BAPTISMAL SERVICE SUNDAY AFTERNOON THE IMPRESSIVE CEREMONY TOOK PLACE AT THE CABIN OF MISS PYTHAGORINA
8098-278278-0005 AS THE AGED GRANDMOTHER WISHED TO WITNESS IT POD SAID HE WAS SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED ABOUT ATTENDING SINCE HE HAD FORGOTTEN ALMOST ALL HIS LATIN
8098-278278-0006 BUT HE ARRANGED WITH ONE OF THE PALL BEARERS TO GIVE HIM NUDGES AND KICKS WHEN IT WAS EXPECTED OF HIM TO MAKE A RESPONSE AND SO HE GOT THROUGH FAIRLY WELL BETTER THAN THE KID DID HE SAID THE BABE WAS AN UNRULY CHILD
8098-278278-0007 AND KICKED SO FRANTICALLY WHEN THE PRIEST TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS THAT TWO FLATIRONS WERE TIED TO ITS FEET TO KEEP THEM DOWN IT WAS SIMPLY NERVOUSNESS BECAUSE THE HIGH ALTITUDE AFFECTED THE CHILD'S NERVES
8098-278278-0008 THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT AND SURPRISE BECAUSE THE FLATIRONS DIDN'T FLOAT AND THE UNDERTAKER OR WHAT YOU CALL EM OVERTURNED THE BARREL OF WATER AND SET EVERYBODY AFLOAT DRENCHING THE SPONSORS AND GUESTS
8098-278278-0009 POD SAID THE SCENE WAS WITHOUT A PARALLEL HE WAS SOAKED TO HIS EQUATOR THE HALF CHRISTENED HALF DROWNED PYTHAGORINA PODINA WAS PICKED UP FROM THE FLOOD WITH A TABLESPOON AND THE CEREMONY FINISHED
8098-278278-0010 THEN SHE WAS ROLLED ON THE BARREL TO GET ALL THE WATER OUT OF HER AND PUT TO BED WITH HOT FLATIRONS AT HER FEET TO PREVENT CROUP AND MUMPS THEN THE WAKE BROKE UP I DON'T BELIEVE THE CHILD UNDERSTOOD A WORD THAT THE PRIEST SAID
8098-278278-0011 POD DIDN'T THAT NIGHT HE GOT UP A FINE SUPPER AND INVITED SOME OLD FRIENDS HE BOUGHT A BIG PORTERHOUSE STEAK THICK AND TENDER AND PERSONALLY BROILED IT ON HIS PATENT FOLDING STOVE
8098-278278-0012 JUST WHEN EVERYTHING WAS ON THE TABLE AND THE GUESTS WERE FINDING STONES AND TIN PLATES TO SIT ON DON NOT HAVING HAD A THING TO EAT FOR AN HOUR COOLLY PULLED THE HOT STEAK OFF THE PLATTER AND DROPPED IT ON THE GROUND
8098-278278-0013 POD DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING THOUGH BUT JUST FORKED IT ON TO THE PLATTER AND SCRAPED OFF SOME DRY GRASS AND A SLIVER AND A BUG AND CARVED IT UP
8098-278278-0014 THE LADIES LOOKED AT THE DOG AND THEN AT POD NOT KNOWING WHICH TO THANK THEN FEELING SENSITIVE ABOUT ACCEPTING THE BEST PART OF THE STEAK INSISTED UPON POD'S HAVING ONE OF THEIR PIECES AND COONSKIN THE OTHER
8098-278278-0015 AFTER SUPPER DON FEASTED ON THE TOUGHER PARTS OF THE STEAK AND WE DONKS WERE FED THE SCRAPS OF POTATOES AND BREAD AND TIN TOMATO AND PEACH CANS WHEN THE BANQUET WAS OVER THE GUESTS WENT HOME
8098-278278-0016 ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK WE WENT INTO CAMP ON THE MARGIN OF A FAMOUS PETRIFIED FOREST POD OBJECTED AT FIRST BECAUSE OF THE SCARCITY OF FIRE WOOD
8098-278278-0017 LOTS OF PETRIFIED WOOD CHIPS LYING AROUND I REMARKED AND THEY'LL LAST ORDINARY WOOD BURNS UP TOO FAST BRIGHT IDEA EXCLAIMED POD AND COONSKIN WENT TO WORK GATHERING PETRIFIED WOOD FOR THE SUPPER FIRE
8098-278278-0018 THE ONLY TROUBLE WILL BE IN STARTING THE FIRE SAID POD JUST AS SOON AS IT'S ONCE GOING IT OUGHT TO BURN SMOOTHLY ENOUGH
8098-278278-0019 COONSKIN'S OPINION DIDN'T BENEFIT POD MUCH HIS HARD WOOD FIRE WASN'T VERY SATISFACTORY BUT WITH SOME DRY BRUSH THE MEN GOT THE MEAL UNDER WAY NEXT MORNING WE VISITED THE NOTED PETRIFIED STUMP
8098-278278-0020 MEASURING UPWARDS OF FORTY FIVE FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE SEVERAL SAWS WERE IMBEDDED IN IT FOR MANY FUTILE ATTEMPTS HAD BEEN MADE TO TAKE OFF SOME SLICES FOR THE DENVER EXPOSITION
8098-278278-0021 IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED BY VARIOUS ORNITHOLOGISTS BOTANISTS AND ENTOMOLOGISTS THAT THE STUMP IS MILLIONS OF YEARS OLD I THINK THEY WERE GUESSING AT IT FOR I COULDN'T SEE THE RINGS
8098-278278-0022 SEVERAL TIMES I HAD A SUSPICION THAT WE HAD BEEN MISDIRECTED WHEN WE CAME TO THE END OF A NARROW WOOD ROAD I WAS SURE OF IT
8098-278278-0023 BEST TO GO THROUGH THE WOODS SAID THE VALET SO WE WERE HEADED FOR THE TIMBER OUR TRAMP THROUGH THE FOREST I CANNOT SOON FORGET UP AND DOWN THE ROCKY HEIGHTS THROUGH THICKETS OF QUAKING ASP AND PINE
8098-278278-0024 AND REALIZED WE WERE LOST COONSKIN SAID HE WAS AN EXPERIENCED WOODMAN AND WOULD BLAZE THE TREES SO WE WOULD GET OUT AGAIN WONDERFUL THE AMOUNT OF LEARNING HE HAD GLEANED FROM DIME NOVELS
8098-278278-0025 HE LAGGED BEHIND TO DO THE BLAZING AND PRETTY SOON I SMELT SMOKE THE PROFESSOR SNUFFED SMELLS AS IF THE WOODS WERE ON FIRE SOMEWHERE HINTED POD LOOK BEHIND YOU THEY ARE I EXCLAIMED
8098-278278-0026 AND POD CAUGHT THAT ERUDITE VALET BACK WOODSMAN IN THE ACT OF SETTING A TREE ON FIRE WITH OIL AND MATCHES FORTUNATELY FOR US THE WIND WASN'T BLOWING STRONG
8098-278278-0027 BUT WE HAD TO CHANGE OUR COURSE SOME AND HUSTLE FASTER FOR THE BLAZING TRAIL CHASED US COONSKIN LEARNED A NEW LESSON AND TURNED DOWN THE CORNER OF THE PAGE SO HE'D RECOLLECT IT
8098-278278-0028 A BOARD SIGN INFORMED US IT WAS SIMPLY TURKEY CREEK I COULDN'T SEE ANY TURKEYS BUT THERE WAS GOOD PASTURAGE AROUND THE HOT TRIP THROUGH THE TIMBER MADE US ALL HUNGRY
8098-278278-0029 IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK WHEN WE DONKS WERE PICKETED AND ALLOWED TO GRAZE THEN COONSKIN WENT FISHING HE SAID HE HAD SEEN SOME TROUT IN THE STREAM BY SUPPER TIME HE HAD CAUGHT A NICE MESS
8098-278278-0030 POD SAID HE WOULD FRY THE FISH AND WENT AT IT SO ENTHUSIASTICALLY THAT HE FORGOT TO PUT THE BAG OF CORN MEAL BACK IN ITS PLACE AFTER THE MEAL WAS OVER HE BEGAN TO LOOK AROUND FOR THE BAG IT WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
8098-278278-0031 I HAD EATEN THE CORN MEAL AND BAG IT WAS COMICAL HOW THOSE TWO MEN PUZZLED THEIR BRAINS ABOUT THAT MISSING COMMODITY WHEN COONSKIN DETECTED SOME MEAL STAMPED IN THE GROUND POD POINTED AT ME AND SAID
8098-278278-0032 THAT'S THE THIEF THERE NEXT MORNING COONSKIN WAS THE FIRST TO RETURN FROM FISHING AND LOOKED MUCH EXCITED WHEN POD RETURNED HE TOLD HIM HE HAD SEEN HUGE BEAR TRACKS HE WAS GOING BEAR HUNTING POD LAUGHED AT HIM
8098-278278-0033 THAT WAS MY EXPERIENCE IN THE WOODS OF WISCONSIN THE MEN AT THE SAW MILL SAID WE SHOULD SEE BEAR IN THIS FOREST
8098-278278-0034 ITS SKIN WOULD FETCH FIFTY DOLLARS OR MORE LET'S LOOK FOR BEAR WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU SAW A BEAR POD ASKED WELL NOW LEAVE THAT TO ME SAID COONSKIN
8098-278278-0035 IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WOULD BE WORTH A HAIRBREADTH ESCAPE TO SEE ONE WILD I'VE ONLY SEEN BEARS IN CIRCUSES OR TRAVELING CHAINED TO ITALIANS IN THE SECOND PLACE I CAN RUN I'VE PLENTY OF MEDALS FOR SPRINTING
8098-278278-0036 POD WENT FISHING THAT AFTERNOON WITH A GUN AND TOOK THE WHOLE ARSENAL ALONG WITH HIM INCLUDING THE AXE SOMEWHERE ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK POD CAME INTO CAMP WITH A GOOD MESS OF TROUT AFTER CLEANING THE FISH HE TOOK OFF HIS GUNS
8098-278278-0037 AND LAID DOWN ON THE GRASS AND WONDERED IF THAT CRAZY VALET HAD RUN ACROSS ANY MORE BEAR TRACKS HE WASN'T THERE LONG WHEN SUDDENLY I HEARD YELLS ISSUING FROM THE CANYON DOWN STREAM ROUND THE BEND
8098-278278-0038 THE SHOUTING SOUNDED NEARER EVERY SECOND AND I SOON DISTINGUISHED COONSKIN'S VOICE POD GOT UP FROM THE GROUND EXCITEDLY COONSKIN'S IN TROUBLE PLAIN ENOUGH SAID POD ALOUD TO HIMSELF I MUST RUN TO HIS AID
8098-278278-0039 SO HE STARTED ON A TROT DOWN STREAM TO THE BEND AND THEN QUICKLY TURNED FALLING ALL OVER HIMSELF AND RAN TOWARD THE CABINS FASTER THAN I EVER SAW HIM RUN BEFORE OR SINCE
8098-278278-0040 AND IMMEDIATELY COONSKIN CAME FLYING INTO VIEW WITH THE BIGGEST BEAR AT HIS HEELS I EVER WANT TO SEE
8123-275193-0000 JEFF THE INQUISITIVE BY GENERAL RUSH C HAWKINS AMONG THE GUNBOATS DOING DUTY ON THE INLAND WATERS OF NORTH CAROLINA IN THE EARLY SPRING OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO
8123-275193-0001 WHICH COMPOSED WHAT COMMODORE GOLDSBOROUGH DESIGNATED HIS PASTEBOARD FLEET WAS THE LOUISIANA COMMANDED BY COMMANDER ALEXANDER MURRAY WHO WAS NOTED FOR HIS EFFICIENCY AND GOOD NATURE HIS TREATMENT OF HIS CREW
8123-275193-0002 MADE HIM ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR OFFICERS IN THE WHOLE FLEET HE ENTERED INTO ALL OF THEIR SPORTS AND SYMPATHIZED WITH THE DISCOMFORTS OF FORECASTLE LIFE HE WAS FOND OF ANIMAL PETS AND ALWAYS WELCOMED THE ARRIVAL OF A NEW ONE
8123-275193-0003 HE WAS A PERFECTLY BLACK PIG OF THE RACER RAZOR BACK ORDER WHICH AT THAT TIME WERE PLENTIFUL IN THE COAST SECTIONS OF THE MORE SOUTHERN OF THE SLAVE HOLDING STATES THEY WERE CALLED RACERS
8123-275193-0004 BECAUSE OF THEIR LONG LEGS SLENDER BODIES AND GREAT CAPACITY FOR RUNNING AND RAZOR BACKS ON ACCOUNT OF THE PROMINENCE OF THE SPINAL COLUMN THE ORIGIN OF THIS PARTICULAR SPECIES OF THE PORCINE TRIBE IS UNKNOWN BUT THERE IS A TRADITION TO THE EFFECT
8123-275193-0005 POSSIBLY WHILE ESCAPING FROM THE PROSPECTIVE MESS KETTLE OF A CONFEDERATE PICKET IN THOSE DAYS CONFEDERATE PICKETS WERE NOT VERY PARTICULAR AS TO THE QUALITY OR KIND OF FOOD AND I HAVE A SUSPICION THAT EVEN A RAZOR BACK WOULD HAVE BEEN A WELCOME ADDITION TO THEIR MEAL
8123-275193-0006 THE DOCTOR WAS CONSULTED AND AFTER A CAREFUL DIAGNOSIS DECIDED THERE WAS NO ORGANIC DISEASE WANT OF PARENTAL CARE WANT OF NOURISHMENT AND EXPOSURE WERE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR JEFF'S UNFAVORABLE CONDITION
8123-275193-0007 IT WAS DECIDED TO PUT HIM ON A LIGHT DIET OF MILK WHICH PROVED AN IMMEDIATE SUCCESS FOR WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS AFTER HIS FIRST MEAL THE PATIENT BECAME AS LIVELY AS POSSIBLE AS DAYS AND WEEKS WENT ON
8123-275193-0008 HE ATTACHED HIMSELF TO EACH INDIVIDUAL OF THE SHIP HE HAD NO FAVORITES BUT WAS HAIL FELLOW WELL MET WITH ALL HE DEVELOPED ALL THE PLAYFUL QUALITIES OF A PUPPY AND REASONED OUT A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS IN HIS OWN WAY
8123-275193-0009 HIS PARTICULAR ADMIRERS DECLARED THAT HE LEARNED THE MEANING OF THE DIFFERENT WHISTLES OF THE BOATSWAIN THAT HE KNEW WHEN THE MEAL PENNANT WAS HOISTED TO THE PEAK COULD TELL WHEN THE CREW WAS BEAT TO QUARTERS FOR DRILL
8123-275193-0010 IN THIS ACT OF COURTESY HE IS ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED BY THE OFFICER OF THE DECK AND OFTEN BY OTHERS THAT MAY HAPPEN TO BE AT HAND AFTER THE ADVENT OF JEFF WHENEVER I WENT ON BOARD THE LOUISIANA HE WAS ALWAYS AT THE GANGWAY
8123-275193-0011 AND SEEMINGLY WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE EVENT IT MAY BE SAID OF HIM GENERALLY THAT HE WAS OVERFLOWING WITH SPIRITS AND TOOK AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN ALL THE DAILY ROUTINE WORK OF HIS SHIP
8123-275193-0012 IN THE GRADUAL DEVELOPMENT OF JEFF'S CHARACTER IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT HE HAD NONE OF THE USUAL WELL KNOWN TRAITS OF THE PIG HE WAS MORE LIKE A PETTED AND PAMPERED DOG
8123-275193-0013 WAS PLAYFUL GOOD NATURED AND EXPRESSED PLEASURE PAIN ANGER AND DESIRE WITH VARIOUS SQUEALS AND GRUNTS DELIVERED WITH A VARIETY OF INTONATIONS THAT WERE VERY EASILY INTERPRETED
8123-275193-0014 HE WAS NEVER SO HAPPY AS WHEN IN THE LAP OF ONE OF THE SAILORS HAVING HIS BACK STROKED HIS PLEASURE UPON THOSE OCCASIONS WAS EVINCED BY THE EMISSION OF FREQUENT GOOD NATURED GRUNTS AND LOOKING UP INTO THE FACE OF THE FRIENDLY STROKER
8123-275193-0015 WHEN ON SHORE HE FOLLOWED HIS FAVORITES LIKE A DOG AND WAS NEVER KNOWN TO ROOT EXCEPT IN SPEECH AND APPEARANCE HE WAS THE COUNTERPART OF A HAPPY GOOD NATURED AND WELL CARED FOR HOUSEHOLD DOG
8123-275193-0016 POSSIBLY HOWEVER RATHER MORE INTELLIGENT THAN THE AVERAGE CANINE PET THE FOURTH OF JULY EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO WAS A GALA DAY AT ROANOKE ISLAND
8123-275193-0017 WAS MADE MORE GLORIOUS BY THE EXCHANGE OF CAMP HOSPITALITIES AND AN INDULGENCE IN SUCH SIMPLE HILARITY AS THE OCCASION SEEMED TO REQUIRE BUT JEFF WAS NOT FORGOTTEN EARLY IN THE MORNING HE WAS BATHED AND SCRUBBED
8123-275193-0018 MORE THAN TO HIS HEART'S CONTENT AND THEN PATRIOTICALLY DECORATED IN HIS RIGHT EAR WAS A RED RIBBON IN HIS LEFT A WHITE ONE AROUND HIS NECK ANOTHER OF BLUE
8123-275193-0019 THUS ADORNED HE WAS BROUGHT ON SHORE TO PAY ME A VISIT AND AS HE CAME THROUGH MY DOOR HE APPEARED TO BE FILLED WITH THE PRIDE OF PATRIOTISM AND A REALIZATION OF THE GREATNESS OF THE OCCASION
8123-275193-0020 HIS REWARD FOR THIS UNUSUAL DEMONSTRATION WAS INSTANTANEOUS AND CONSISTED OF SOME APPLES AND A TOOTHSOME DESSERT OF SUGAR AFTERWARD HE MADE THE ROUND OF THE CAMPS WITH A SPECIAL ESCORT OF WARRANT OFFICERS AND DEVOTED JACK TARS
8123-275193-0021 HE WAS SEEN AFTER HE HAD RUN A FEW YARDS TO MAKE A GREAT JUMP AND THEN REMAIN IN HIS TRACKS THE PURSUING PARTY FOUND HIM ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN DEMOLISHING A MOCCASIN WHICH HE HAD CRUSHED BY JUMPING AND LANDING WITH HIS FEET UPON ITS HEAD AND BACK
8123-275193-0022 HOGS OF THIS PARTICULAR KIND ARE FAMOUS SNAKE KILLERS A BIG RATTLER OR A GARTER SNAKE IS ALL THE SAME TO THEM THEY ADVANCE TO THE ATTACK WITH THE GREATEST IMPETUOSITY AND A FEAST UPON SNAKE IS THE USUAL REWARD OF EXCEPTIONAL BRAVERY
8123-275193-0023 JEFF WAS A CONFIRMED LOVER OF GOOD EATING AND IN TIME PAID THE USUAL PENALTY FOR OVER INDULGENCE OF HIS VERY PIGGISH APPETITE WHILE THE MEAL PENNANT WAS UP
8123-275193-0024 IT WAS HIS HABIT TO GO FROM ONE FORE CASTLE MESS TO ANOTHER AND TO INSIST UPON HAVING RATHER MORE THAN HIS SHARE OF THE CHOICE MORSELS FROM EACH IN A SHORT TIME HE CAME TO THE REPAIR SHOP VERY MUCH THE WORSE FOR WEAR WITH AN IMPAIRED DIGESTION
8123-275193-0025 AND A CUTICLE THAT SHOWED UNMISTAKABLE EVIDENCE OF SCURVY FOR THE FIRST HE WAS PUT UPON SHORT RATIONS FOR THE SECOND SAND BATHS ON SHORE WERE PRESCRIBED
8123-275193-0026 UNDER THIS TREATMENT POOR JEFF LOST ALL HIS BUOYANCY OF SPIRITS AND HIS HABITUAL FRISKINESS AND BECAME SAD AND DEJECTED BUT BORE HIS TROUBLES WITH PATIENCE HE TOOK TO THE SAND BATHS AT ONCE
8123-275193-0027 AND GAVE FORTH MANY DISGRUNTLED GRUNTS WHEN LIFTED OUT OF THEM THE LAST TIME I SAW JEFF IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO HE WAS BURIED UP TO HIS EARS IN THE COOL SANDS OF THE ROANOKE ISLAND SHORE WITH EYES UPTURNED AND LOOKING LIKE A VERY SAD PIG
8123-275209-0000 THE BUTTERFLY'S CHILDREN BY MISSUS ALFRED GATTY LET ME HIRE YOU AS A NURSE FOR MY POOR CHILDREN SAID A BUTTERFLY TO A QUIET CATERPILLAR WHO WAS STROLLING ALONG A CABBAGE LEAF IN HER
8123-275209-0001 WHO WILL TAKE CARE OF MY BABY BUTTERFLIES WHEN I AM GONE WILL YOU KIND MILD GREEN CATERPILLAR BUT YOU MUST MIND WHAT YOU GIVE THEM TO EAT CATERPILLAR THEY CANNOT OF COURSE LIVE ON YOUR ROUGH FOOD
8123-275209-0002 YOU MUST GIVE THEM EARLY DEW AND HONEY FROM THE FLOWERS AND YOU MUST LET THEM FLY ABOUT ONLY A LITTLE WAY AT FIRST FOR OF COURSE ONE CAN'T EXPECT THEM TO USE THEIR WINGS PROPERLY ALL AT ONCE
8123-275209-0003 DEAR ME IT IS A SAD PITY YOU CANNOT FLY YOURSELF BUT I HAVE NO TIME TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER NURSE NOW SO YOU WILL DO YOUR BEST I HOPE DEAR DEAR
8123-275209-0004 AND WITH THESE WORDS THE BUTTERFLY DROOPED HER WINGS AND DIED AND THE GREEN CATERPILLAR WHO HAD NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF EVEN SAYING YES OR NO TO THE REQUEST
8123-275209-0005 WAS LEFT STANDING ALONE BY THE SIDE OF THE BUTTERFLY'S EGGS A PRETTY NURSE SHE HAS CHOSEN INDEED POOR LADY EXCLAIMED SHE AND A PRETTY BUSINESS I HAVE IN HAND WHY HER SENSES MUST HAVE LEFT HER
8123-275209-0006 OR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE ASKED A POOR CRAWLING CREATURE LIKE ME TO BRING UP HER DAINTY LITTLE ONES MUCH THEY'LL MIND ME TRULY WHEN THEY FEEL THE GAY WINGS ON THEIR BACKS AND CAN FLY AWAY OUT OF MY SIGHT WHENEVER THEY CHOOSE
8123-275209-0007 HOWEVER THERE LAY THE EGGS ON THE CABBAGE LEAF AND THE GREEN CATERPILLAR HAD A KIND HEART SO SHE RESOLVED TO DO HER BEST BUT SHE GOT NO SLEEP THAT NIGHT SHE WAS SO VERY ANXIOUS
8123-275209-0008 SHE MADE HER BACK QUITE ACHE WITH WALKING ALL NIGHT ROUND HER YOUNG CHARGES FOR FEAR ANY HARM SHOULD HAPPEN TO THEM AND IN THE MORNING SAYS SHE TO HERSELF TWO HEADS ARE BETTER THAN ONE
8123-275209-0009 WHOM SHOULD THE CATERPILLAR CONSULT THERE WAS THE SHAGGY DOG WHO SOMETIMES CAME INTO THE GARDEN BUT HE WAS SO ROUGH HE WOULD MOST LIKELY WHISK ALL THE EGGS OFF THE CABBAGE LEAF WITH ONE BRUSH OF HIS TAIL
8123-275209-0010 SIGHED THE CATERPILLAR IN GREAT DISTRESS AND THEN SHE THOUGHT AND THOUGHT TILL AT LAST SHE THOUGHT OF THE LARK AND SHE FANCIED THAT BECAUSE HE WENT UP SO HIGH AND NOBODY KNEW WHERE HE WENT TO
8123-275209-0011 HE MUST BE VERY CLEVER AND KNOW A GREAT DEAL FOR TO GO UP VERY HIGH WHICH SHE COULD NEVER DO WAS THE CATERPILLAR'S IDEA OF PERFECT GLORY NOW IN THE NEIGHBOURING CORN FIELD THEIR LIVED A LARK
8123-275209-0012 AND THE CATERPILLAR SENT A MESSAGE TO HIM TO BEG HIM TO COME AND TALK TO HER AND WHEN HE CAME SHE TOLD HIM ALL HER DIFFICULTIES AND ASKED HIM WHAT SHE WAS TO DO TO FEED AND REAR THE LITTLE CREATURES SO DIFFERENT FROM HERSELF
8123-275209-0013 PERHAPS YOU WILL BE ABLE TO INQUIRE AND HEAR SOMETHING ABOUT IT NEXT TIME YOU GO UP HIGH OBSERVED THE CATERPILLAR TIMIDLY THE LARK SAID PERHAPS HE SHOULD BUT HE DID NOT SATISFY HER CURIOSITY ANY FURTHER
8123-275209-0014 SOON AFTERWARDS HOWEVER HE WENT SINGING UPWARDS INTO THE BRIGHT BLUE SKY BY DEGREES HIS VOICE DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE TILL THE GREEN CATERPILLAR COULD NOT HEAR A SOUND
8123-275209-0015 SO SHE RESUMED HER WALK ROUND THE BUTTERFLY'S EGGS NIBBLING A BIT OF THE CABBAGE LEAF NOW AND THEN AS SHE MOVED ALONG
8123-275209-0016 I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I AM TOLD OBSERVED THE CATERPILLAR HASTILY WELL THEN FIRST OF ALL I WILL TELL YOU WHAT THESE LITTLE CREATURES ARE TO EAT WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS TO BE GUESS
8123-275209-0017 DEW AND THE HONEY OUT OF FLOWERS I AM AFRAID SIGHED THE CATERPILLAR NO SUCH THING OLD LADY SOMETHING SIMPLER THAN THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN GET AT QUITE EASILY
8123-275209-0018 NEVER SAID THE CATERPILLAR INDIGNANTLY IT WAS THEIR DYING MOTHER'S LAST REQUEST THAT I SHOULD DO NO SUCH THING THEIR DYING MOTHER KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE MATTER PERSISTED THE LARK
8123-275209-0019 BUT WHY DO YOU ASK ME AND THEN DISBELIEVE WHAT I SAY YOU HAVE NEITHER FAITH NOR TRUST OH I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I AM TOLD SAID THE CATERPILLAR NAY BUT YOU DO NOT REPLIED THE LARK YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME EVEN ABOUT THE FOOD
8123-275209-0020 AND YET THAT IS BUT A BEGINNING OF WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHY CATERPILLAR WHAT DO YOU THINK THOSE LITTLE EGGS WILL TURN OUT TO BE BUTTERFLIES TO BE SURE SAID THE CATERPILLAR CATERPILLARS SANG THE LARK
8123-275209-0021 BUT I FIND THAT HE IS FOOLISH AND SAUCY INSTEAD
8123-275209-0022 I WOULD TELL YOU IF YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME SANG THE LARK DESCENDING ONCE MORE I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I AM TOLD REITERATED THE CATERPILLAR WITH AS GRAVE A FACE AS IF IT WERE A FACT
8123-275209-0023 THEN I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE CRIED THE LARK FOR THE BEST OF MY NEWS REMAINS BEHIND YOU WILL ONE DAY BE A BUTTERFLY YOURSELF WRETCHED BIRD EXCLAIMED THE CATERPILLAR
8123-275209-0024 YOU JEST WITH MY INFERIORITY NOW YOU ARE CRUEL AS WELL AS FOOLISH

8123-275209-0031 FOR AS THE FIRST WONDER WAS POSSIBLE THE SECOND MIGHT BE SO TOO TEACH ME YOUR LESSON LARK SHE WOULD SAY AND THE LARK SANG TO HER OF THE WONDERS OF THE EARTH BELOW AND OF THE HEAVEN ABOVE
8123-275209-0032 AND THE CATERPILLAR TALKED ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE TO HER RELATIONS OF THE TIME WHEN SHE SHOULD BE A BUTTERFLY BUT NONE OF THEM BELIEVED HER SHE NEVERTHELESS HAD LEARNT THE LARK'S LESSON OF FAITH
8123-275209-0033 AND WHEN SHE WAS GOING INTO HER CHRYSALIS GRAVE SHE SAID I SHALL BE A BUTTERFLY SOME DAY BUT HER RELATIONS THOUGHT HER HEAD WAS WANDERING AND THEY SAID POOR THING
8123-275209-0034 AND WHEN SHE WAS A BUTTERFLY AND WAS GOING TO DIE AGAIN SHE SAID

8123-275216-0011 I WILL BRING SOME BEECH NUTS WITH ME AND I VOW YOU WILL ALL TURN YELLOW WITH JEALOUSY WHEN YOU SEE HOW PRETTY THE NEW TREES ARE THEN HE MADE OFF BUT THE OAKS TALKED THE WHOLE DAY LONG ONE TO ANOTHER ABOUT THE FUNNY TREES HE HAD TOLD THEM ABOUT
8123-275216-0012 IF THEY COME I WILL KILL THEM SAID THE LITTLE OAK TREE BUT DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS HE GOT ONE ON THE HEAD FROM THE OLD OAK IF THEY COME YOU SHALL TREAT THEM POLITELY YOU YOUNG DOG SAID HE BUT THEY WILL NOT COME
8123-275216-0013 BUT IN THIS THE OLD OAK WAS WRONG FOR THEY DID COME TOWARDS AUTUMN THE BEAR CAME BACK AND LAY DOWN UNDER THE OLD OAK MY FRIENDS DOWN THERE WISH ME TO PRESENT THEIR COMPLIMENTS HE SAID

8123-275216-0016 THE SNOW LAY HIGH OVER THE WHOLE LAND AND EVERY TREE STOOD DEEP IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS AND DREAMT OF THE SPRING AND WHEN THE SPRING CAME THE GRASS STOOD GREEN AND THE BIRDS BEGAN SINGING WHERE THEY LEFT OFF LAST
8123-275216-0017 THE KINGS OF THE WOOD DO NOT COME TILL THE WHOLE COMPANY IS ASSEMBLED BUT AT LAST THEY CAME ALL THE LEAVES BURST FORTH FROM THE SWOLLEN BUDS AND THE TREES LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND COMPLIMENTED ONE ANOTHER ON THEIR BEAUTY
8123-275216-0018 AND EVERY MORNING WHEN THE SUN CAME OUT THEY PEEPED DOWN TO LOOK FOR THE BEECHES THEY WERE REALLY A LITTLE UNEASY BUT THEY WERE TOO PROUD TO TALK ABOUT IT AND ONE DAY THE LITTLE SHOOTS DID AT LAST BURST FORTH FROM THE EARTH
8123-275216-0019 THE SUN SHONE ON THEM AND THE RAIN FELL ON THEM SO IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY GREW TALL OH HOW PRETTY THEY ARE SAID THE GREAT OAK AND STOOPED HIS CROOKED BOUGHS STILL MORE SO THAT THEY COULD GET A GOOD VIEW OF THEM

8123-275216-0025 THE BEECHES ONLY LAUGHED AND WENT ON GROWING AT LAST THEY CLOSED TOGETHER OVER THE LITTLE OAK'S HEAD AND THEN HE DIED THAT WAS A HORRID THING TO DO
8123-275216-0026 A GREAT OAK CALLED OUT AND SHOOK HIS BOUGHS IN TERROR BUT THE OLD OAK TOOK HIS FOSTER CHILDREN UNDER HIS PROTECTION IT SERVES HIM RIGHT HE SAID HE IS PAID OUT FOR HIS BOASTING
8123-275216-0027 YOU BEGIN TO BE RATHER PUSHING THE OLD TREE SAID YOU SHOULD TRY TO GROW A LITTLE BROADER AND STOP THIS SHOOTING UP INTO THE AIR JUST SEE WHERE YOUR BRANCHES ARE SOARING

8123-275216-0030 THAT IS NOT A POLITE WAY OF SPEAKING TO AN OLD TREE WITH MOSS ON HIS BOUGHS SAID THE OAK I BEGIN TO REPENT THAT I WAS SO KIND TO YOU IF YOU HAVE A SPARK OF HONOURABLE FEELING ALIVE IN YOU
8123-275216-0031 BE GOOD ENOUGH TO MOVE YOUR LEAVES A LITTLE TO ONE SIDE THERE HAVE BEEN SCARCELY ANY BUDS ON MY LOWEST BRANCHES THIS YEAR YOU OVERSHADOW ME SO I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND HOW THAT CONCERNS US ANSWERED THE BEECHES
8123-275216-0032 EVERY ONE HAS QUITE ENOUGH TO DO TO LOOK AFTER HIMSELF IF HE IS EQUAL TO HIS WORK AND HAS LUCK IT TURNS OUT WELL FOR HIM IF NOT HE MUST BE PREPARED TO GO TO THE WALL THAT IS THE WAY OF THE WORLD
8123-275216-0033 THEN THE OAK'S LOWEST BRANCH DIED AND HE BEGAN TO BE SERIOUSLY ALARMED YOU ARE PRETTY THINGS HE SAID IF THIS IS THE WAY YOU REWARD ME FOR MY HOSPITALITY WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE I LET YOU GROW AT MY FEET
8123-275216-0034 AND SHELTERED YOU AGAINST THE STORM I LET THE SUN SHINE ON YOU AS MUCH AS EVER HE WOULD AND I TREATED YOU AS IF YOU WERE MY OWN CHILDREN AND IN RETURN FOR ALL THIS YOU STIFLE ME STUFF AND NONSENSE
8123-275216-0035 SAID THE BEECHES SO THEY PUT FORTH FLOWERS AND FRUIT AND WHEN THE FRUIT WAS RIPE THE WIND SHOOK THE BOUGHS AND SCATTERED IT ROUND FAR AND WIDE YOU ARE QUICK PEOPLE LIKE ME SAID THE WIND I LIKE YOU FOR IT
8123-275216-0036 AND AM GLAD TO DO YOU A GOOD TURN AND THE FOX ROLLED ON THE GROUND AT THE FOOT OF THE BEECH TREES AND GOT HIS FUR FULL OF THE PRICKLY FRUITS AND RAN WITH THEM FAR OUT INTO THE COUNTRY THE BEAR DID THE SAME
8123-275216-0037 AND GRINNED INTO THE BARGAIN AT THE OLD OAK WHILE HE LAY AND RESTED IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES THE FIELD MOUSE WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH JOY OVER HIS NEW FOOD AND THOUGHT THAT BEECH NUTS TASTED MUCH NICER THAN ACORNS
8123-275216-0038 ALL ROUND NEW LITTLE BEECH TREES SHOT UP WHICH GREW JUST AS FAST AS THEIR PARENTS AND LOOKED AS GREEN AND AS HAPPY AS IF THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT AN UNEASY CONSCIENCE WAS
8123-275216-0039 BUT THE OLD OAK GAZED SADLY OUT OVER THE WOOD THE LIGHT GREEN BEECH LEAVES WERE PEEPING OUT EVERYWHERE AND THE OAKS WERE SIGHING AND BEWAILING THEIR DISTRESS TO ONE ANOTHER
8123-275216-0040 THEY ARE TAKING OUR STRENGTH OUT OF US THEY SAID AND SHOOK AS MUCH AS THE BEECHES AROUND WOULD LET THEM THE LAND IS OURS NO LONGER ONE BOUGH DIED AFTER ANOTHER
8123-275216-0041 AND THE STORM BROKE THEM OFF AND CAST THEM ON THE GROUND THE OLD OAK HAD NOW ONLY A FEW LEAVES LEFT AT THE VERY TOP THE END IS NEAR HE SAID GRAVELY
8123-275216-0042 BY THIS TIME THERE WERE MANY MORE HUMAN BEINGS IN THE LAND THAN THERE WERE BEFORE AND THEY MADE HASTE TO HEW DOWN THE OAKS WHILE THERE WERE STILL SOME REMAINING OAK TIMBER IS BETTER THAN BEECH TIMBER THEY SAID
8123-275216-0043 AT LAST WE GET A LITTLE APPRECIATION SAID THE OLD OAK BUT WE HAVE TO PAY FOR IT WITH OUR LIVES THEN HE SAID TO THE BEECH TREES WHAT WAS I THINKING OF WHEN I HELPED YOU ON IN YOUR YOUNG DAYS
8123-275216-0044 WHAT AN OLD STUPID I WAS BEFORE THAT WE OAK TREES WERE LORDS IN THE LAND AND NOW EVERY YEAR I SEE MY BROTHERS AROUND ME PERISHING IN THE FIGHT AGAINST YOU IT WILL SOON BE ALL OVER WITH ME
8123-275216-0045 AND NOT ONE OF MY ACORNS HAS SPROUTED UNDER YOUR SHADE BUT BEFORE I DIE I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE NAME YOU GIVE TO SUCH CONDUCT THAT WILL NOT TAKE LONG TO SAY OLD FRIEND ANSWERED THE BEECHES
8226-274369-0000 EVERY MEASURE PURSUED BY THE COMMONS
8226-274369-0001 BESIDES NUMBERLESS VEXATIONS AND PERSECUTIONS WHICH THE CLERGY UNDERWENT FROM THE ARBITRARY POWER OF THE LOWER HOUSE THE PEERS WHILE THE KING WAS IN SCOTLAND
8226-274369-0002 HAVING PASSED AN ORDER FOR THE OBSERVANCE OF THE LAWS WITH REGARD TO PUBLIC WORSHIP THE COMMONS ASSUMED SUCH AUTHORITY THAT BY A VOTE ALONE OF THEIR HOUSE THEY SUSPENDED THOSE LAWS THOUGH ENACTED BY THE WHOLE LEGISLATURE
8226-274369-0003 THEY COMPLAINED OF THE KING'S FILLING FIVE VACANT SEES AND CONSIDERED IT AS AN INSULT UPON THEM
8226-274369-0004 THEY MADE A DEMAND THE MOST ABSURD IN THE WORLD THAT THE BISHOPS BEING ALL OF THEM PARTIES SHOULD BE REFUSED A VOTE WITH REGARD TO THAT QUESTION AFTER THE RESOLUTION WAS ONCE FORMED BY THE COMMONS
8226-274369-0005 OF INVADING THE ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT OF CHURCH AND STATE IT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED THAT THEIR PROCEEDINGS IN SUCH A VIOLENT ATTEMPT WOULD THENCEFORTH BE ALTOGETHER REGULAR AND EQUITABLE BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT
8226-274369-0006 IN THEIR ATTACK ON THE HIERARCHY THEY STILL MORE OPENLY PASSED ALL BOUNDS OF MODERATION AS SUPPOSING NO DOUBT
8226-274369-0007 HAD ALREADY RISEN TO A GREAT HEIGHT AND GAVE SUFFICIENT WARNING OF THEIR FUTURE ATTEMPTS UPON THAT ORDER THEY MUTTERED SOMEWHAT OF THEIR REGRET THAT THEY SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO SAVE THE KINGDOM ALONE
8226-274369-0008 AND THAT THE HOUSE OF PEERS WOULD HAVE NO PART IN THE HONOR NAY THEY WENT SO FAR AS OPENLY TO TELL THE LORDS THAT THEY THEMSELVES WERE THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY OF THE WHOLE KINGDOM
8226-274369-0009 AND THAT THE PEERS WERE NOTHING BUT INDIVIDUALS WHO HELD THEIR SEATS IN A PARTICULAR CAPACITY AND THEREFORE IF THEIR LORDSHIPS WILL NOT CONSENT TO THE PASSING OF ACTS NECESSARY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE PEOPLE THE COMMONS
8226-274369-0010 TOGETHER WITH SUCH OF THE LORDS AS ARE MORE SENSIBLE OF THE DANGER MUST JOIN TOGETHER AND REPRESENT THE MATTER TO HIS MAJESTY SO VIOLENT WAS THE DEMOCRATICAL ENTHUSIASTIC SPIRIT DIFFUSED THROUGHOUT THE NATION
8226-274369-0011 THAT A TOTAL CONFUSION OF ALL RANK AND ORDER WAS JUSTLY TO BE APPREHENDED AND THE WONDER WAS NOT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE NOBLES SHOULD SEEK SHELTER UNDER THE THRONE
8226-274369-0012 BUT THE TIDE OF POPULARITY SEIZED MANY AND CARRIED THEM WIDE OF THE MOST ESTABLISHED MAXIMS OF CIVIL POLICY AMONG THE OPPONENTS OF THE KING ARE RANKED THE EARL OF NORTHUMBERLAND LORD ADMIRAL A MAN OF THE FIRST FAMILY AND FORTUNE
8226-274369-0013 AND ENDOWED WITH THAT DIGNIFIED PRIDE WHICH SO WELL BECAME HIS RANK AND STATION THE EARL OF ESSEX WHO INHERITED ALL HIS FATHER'S POPULARITY AND HAVING FROM HIS EARLY YOUTH SOUGHT RENOWN IN ARMS
8226-274369-0014 UNITED TO A MIDDLING CAPACITY THAT RIGID INFLEXIBILITY OF HONOR WHICH FORMS THE PROPER ORNAMENT OF A NOBLEMAN AND A SOLDIER LORD KIMBOLTON SOON AFTER EARL OF MANCHESTER A PERSON DISTINGUISHED BY HUMANITY GENEROSITY
8226-274369-0015 AFFABILITY AND EVERY AMIABLE VIRTUE THESE MEN FINDING THAT THEIR CREDIT RAN HIGH WITH THE NATION VENTURED TO ENCOURAGE THOSE POPULAR DISORDERS WHICH THEY VAINLY IMAGINED
8226-274369-0016 THEY POSSESSED AUTHORITY SUFFICIENT TO REGULATE AND CONTROL IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A MAJORITY IN THE UPPER HOUSE THE COMMONS HAD RECOURSE TO THE POPULACE WHO ON OTHER OCCASIONS HAD DONE THEM SUCH IMPORTANT SERVICE
8226-274369-0017 AMIDST THE GREATEST SECURITY THEY AFFECTED CONTINUAL FEARS OF DESTRUCTION TO THEMSELVES AND THE NATION AND SEEMED TO QUAKE AT EVERY BREATH OR RUMOR OF DANGER
8226-274369-0018 HOWEVER RIDICULOUS WERE WILLINGLY ATTENDED TO AND WERE DISPERSED AMONG THE MULTITUDE TO WHOSE CAPACITY THEY WERE WELL ADAPTED BEALE A TAILOR INFORMED THE COMMONS THAT WALKING IN THE FIELDS
8226-274369-0019 HE HAD HEARKENED TO THE DISCOURSE OF CERTAIN PERSONS UNKNOWN TO HIM AND HAD HEARD THEM TALK OF A MOST DANGEROUS CONSPIRACY A HUNDRED AND EIGHT RUFFIANS AS HE LEARNED HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO MURDER A HUNDRED AND EIGHT LORDS AND COMMONERS
8226-274369-0020 AND WERE PROMISED REWARDS FOR THESE ASSASSINATIONS
8226-274369-0021 FORTY SHILLINGS FOR EACH COMMONER UPON THIS NOTABLE INTELLIGENCE ORDERS WERE ISSUED FOR SEIZING PRIESTS AND JESUITS A CONFERENCE WAS DESIRED WITH THE LORDS
8226-274369-0022 AND THE DEPUTY LIEUTENANTS OF SOME SUSPECTED COUNTIES WERE ORDERED TO PUT THE PEOPLE IN A POSTURE OF DEFENCE THE PULPITS LIKEWISE WERE CALLED IN AID
8226-274369-0023 AND RESOUNDED WITH THE DANGERS WHICH THREATENED RELIGION FROM THE DESPERATE ATTEMPTS OF PAPISTS AND MALIGNANTS MULTITUDES FLOCKED TOWARDS WESTMINSTER AND INSULTED THE PRELATES AND SUCH OF THE LORDS AS ADHERED TO THE CROWN
8226-274369-0024 THE PEERS VOTED A DECLARATION AGAINST THOSE TUMULTS AND SENT IT TO THE LOWER HOUSE BUT THESE REFUSED THEIR CONCURRENCE SOME SEDITIOUS APPRENTICES BEING SEIZED AND COMMITTED TO PRISON IMMEDIATELY RECEIVED THEIR LIBERTY
8226-274369-0025 DURING THIS TIME OF DISORDER AND DANGER OFFERED THEIR SERVICE TO THE KING BETWEEN THEM AND THE POPULACE THERE PASSED FREQUENT SKIRMISHES WHICH ENDED NOT WITHOUT BLOODSHED BY WAY OF REPROACH
8226-274369-0026 THESE GENTLEMEN GAVE THE RABBLE THE APPELLATION OF ROUNDHEADS ON ACCOUNT OF THE SHORT CROPPED HAIR WHICH THEY WORE THESE CALLED THE OTHERS CAVALIERS AND THUS THE NATION
8226-274369-0027 WHICH WAS BEFORE SUFFICIENTLY PROVIDED WITH RELIGIOUS AS WELL AS CIVIL CAUSES OF QUARREL WAS ALSO SUPPLIED WITH PARTY NAMES UNDER WHICH THE FACTIONS MIGHT RENDEZVOUS AND SIGNALIZE THEIR MUTUAL HATRED
8226-274369-0028 BEING DISTINGUISHABLE BY THEIR HABIT AND BEING THE OBJECT OF VIOLENT HATRED TO ALL THE SECTARIES WERE EXPOSED TO THE MOST DANGEROUS INSULTS WILLIAMS NOW CREATED ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
8226-274369-0029 THAT THOUGH THEY HAD AN UNDOUBTED RIGHT TO SIT AND VOTE IN PARLIAMENT YET IN COMING THITHER THEY HAD BEEN MENACED ASSAULTED AFFRONTED BY THE UNRULY MULTITUDE AND COULD NO LONGER WITH SAFETY ATTEND THEIR DUTY IN THE HOUSE
8226-274369-0030 FOR THIS REASON THEY PROTESTED AGAINST ALL LAWS VOTES AND RESOLUTIONS AS NULL AND INVALID WHICH SHOULD PASS DURING THE TIME OF THEIR CONSTRAINED ABSENCE THIS PROTESTATION WHICH
8226-274369-0031 THAT HOUSE DESIRED A CONFERENCE WITH THE COMMONS WHOM THEY INFORMED OF THIS UNEXPECTED PROTESTATION THE OPPORTUNITY WAS SEIZED WITH JOY AND TRIUMPH
8226-274369-0032 THE KING WAS BETRAYED INTO ANOTHER INDISCRETION MUCH MORE FATAL AN INDISCRETION TO WHICH ALL THE ENSUING DISORDERS AND CIVIL WARS OUGHT IMMEDIATELY AND DIRECTLY TO BE ASCRIBED
8226-274369-0033 THIS WAS THE IMPEACHMENT OF LORD KIMBOLTON AND THE FIVE MEMBERS WHEN THE COMMONS EMPLOYED IN THEIR REMONSTRANCE LANGUAGE SO SEVERE AND INDECENT THEY HAD NOT BEEN ACTUATED ENTIRELY BY INSOLENCE AND PASSION
8226-274369-0034 THEIR VIEWS WERE MORE SOLID AND PROFOUND THEY CONSIDERED THAT IN A VIOLENT ATTEMPT SUCH AS AN INVASION OF THE ANCIENT CONSTITUTION THE MORE LEISURE WAS AFFORDED THE PEOPLE TO REFLECT
8226-274369-0035 THE LESS WOULD THEY BE INCLINED TO SECOND THAT RASH AND DANGEROUS ENTERPRISE THAT THE PEERS WOULD CERTAINLY REFUSE THEIR CONCURRENCE NOR WERE THERE ANY HOPES OF PREVAILING ON THEM BUT BY INSTIGATING THE POPULACE TO TUMULT AND DISORDER
8226-274369-0036 THAT THE EMPLOYING OF SUCH ODIOUS MEANS FOR SO INVIDIOUS AN END WOULD AT LONG RUN LOSE THEM ALL THEIR POPULARITY AND TURN THE TIDE OF FAVOR TO THE CONTRARY PARTY AND THAT IF THE KING ONLY REMAINED IN TRANQUILLITY
8226-274369-0037 THEY WERE THEREFORE RESOLVED IF POSSIBLE TO EXCITE HIM TO SOME VIOLENT PASSION
8226-274369-0038 IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY SUCCEEDED BEYOND THEIR FONDEST WISHES CHARLES WAS ENRAGED TO FIND THAT ALL HIS CONCESSIONS BUT INCREASED THEIR DEMANDS
8226-274369-0039 WERE AGAIN ROUSED TO SEDITION AND TUMULTS THAT THE BLACKEST CALUMNIES WERE PROPAGATED AGAINST HIM AND EVEN THE IRISH MASSACRE ASCRIBED TO HIS COUNSELS AND MACHINATIONS
8226-274369-0040 HE WAS APT TO ASCRIBE THEM IN A GREAT MEASURE TO HIS OWN INDOLENCE AND FACILITY THE QUEEN AND THE LADIES OF THE COURT FURTHER STIMULATED HIS PASSION AND REPRESENTED THAT
8226-274369-0041 IF HE EXERTED THE VIGOR AND DISPLAYED THE MAJESTY OF A MONARCH THE DARING USURPATIONS OF HIS SUBJECTS WOULD SHRINK BEFORE HIM LORD DIGBY A MAN OF FINE PARTS BUT FULL OF LEVITY AND HURRIED ON BY PRECIPITATE PASSIONS
8226-274369-0042 THAT THEY HAD TRAITOROUSLY ENDEAVORED TO SUBVERT THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS AND GOVERNMENT OF THE KINGDOM TO DEPRIVE THE KING OF HIS REGAL POWER AND TO IMPOSE ON HIS SUBJECTS AN ARBITRARY AND TYRANNICAL AUTHORITY THAT THEY HAD ENDEAVORED
8226-274369-0043 BY MANY FOUL ASPERSIONS ON HIS MAJESTY AND HIS GOVERNMENT TO ALIENATE THE AFFECTIONS OF HIS PEOPLE AND MAKE HIM ODIOUS TO THEM THAT THEY HAD ATTEMPTED TO DRAW HIS LATE ARMY TO DISOBEDIENCE OF HIS ROYAL COMMANDS
8226-274369-0044 AND TO SIDE WITH THEM IN THEIR TRAITOROUS DESIGNS
8226-274369-0045 SEEM TO BE COMMON BETWEEN THE IMPEACHED MEMBERS AND THE PARLIAMENT
8226-274369-0046 THAN SO FAR AS THEY CONCURRED WITH THE MAJORITY IN THEIR VOTES AND SPEECHES THOUGH PROOFS MIGHT PERHAPS BE PRODUCED OF THEIR PRIVATELY INVITING THE SCOTS TO INVADE ENGLAND
8226-274369-0047 HOW COULD SUCH AN ATTEMPT BE CONSIDERED AS TREASON AFTER THE ACT OF OBLIVION WHICH HAD PASSED AND AFTER THAT BOTH HOUSES WITH THE KING'S CONCURRENCE HAD VOTED THAT NATION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS FOR THEIR BROTHERLY ASSISTANCE
8226-274369-0048 WHILE THE HOUSE OF PEERS ARE SCARCELY ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCY OR TO REJECT THE BILLS SENT THEM BY THE COMMONS WILL THEY EVER BE PERMITTED BY THE POPULACE SUPPOSING THEM INCLINED
8226-274369-0049 BUT SURELY WAS NEVER BEFORE ATTEMPTED IN OPPOSITION TO A FACTION DURING THE FULL TIDE OF ITS POWER AND SUCCESS BUT MEN HAD NOT LEISURE TO WONDER AT THE INDISCRETION OF THIS MEASURE
8226-274369-0050 MESSENGERS WERE EMPLOYED TO SEARCH FOR THEM AND ARREST THEM THEIR TRUNKS CHAMBERS AND STUDIES WERE SEALED AND LOCKED THE HOUSE VOTED ALL THESE ACTS OF VIOLENCE TO BE BREACHES OF PRIVILEGE
8226-274369-0051 AND COMMANDED EVERY ONE TO DEFEND THE LIBERTY OF THE MEMBERS THE KING IRRITATED BY ALL THIS OPPOSITION RESOLVED NEXT DAY TO COME IN PERSON TO THE HOUSE WITH AN INTENTION TO DEMAND PERHAPS SEIZE IN THEIR PRESENCE
8226-274369-0052 THE PERSONS WHOM HE HAD ACCUSED THIS RESOLUTION WAS DISCOVERED TO THE COUNTESS OF CARLISLE SISTER TO NORTHUMBERLAND A LADY OF SPIRIT WIT AND INTRIGUE SHE PRIVATELY SENT INTELLIGENCE TO THE FIVE MEMBERS
8226-274369-0053 AND THEY HAD TIME TO WITHDRAW A MOMENT BEFORE THE KING ENTERED HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS ORDINARY RETINUE TO THE NUMBER OF ABOVE TWO HUNDRED ARMED AS USUAL SOME WITH HALBERTS
8226-274369-0054 YESTERDAY I SENT A SERJEANT AT ARMS TO DEMAND SOME WHO BY MY ORDER WERE ACCUSED OF HIGH TREASON INSTEAD OF OBEDIENCE I RECEIVED A MESSAGE I MUST HERE DECLARE TO YOU
8226-274369-0055 THAT THOUGH NO KING THAT EVER WAS IN ENGLAND COULD BE MORE CAREFUL OF YOUR PRIVILEGES THAN I SHALL BE YET IN CASES OF TREASON NO PERSON HAS PRIVILEGE
8226-274369-0056 I NEVER DID INTEND ANY FORCE BUT SHALL PROCEED AGAINST THEM IN A FAIR AND LEGAL WAY FOR I NEVER MEANT ANY OTHER AND NOW SINCE I SEE I CANNOT DO WHAT I CAME FOR
8226-274369-0057 HE ASKED THE SPEAKER WHO STOOD BELOW WHETHER ANY OF THESE PERSONS WERE IN THE HOUSE THE SPEAKER FALLING ON HIS KNEE PRUDENTLY REPLIED I HAVE SIR
8226-274369-0058 NEITHER EYES TO SEE NOR TONGUE TO SPEAK IN THIS PLACE BUT AS THE HOUSE IS PLEASED TO DIRECT ME WHOSE SERVANT I AM AND I HUMBLY ASK PARDON
8226-274369-0059 WHO WERE APPOINTED FOR THAT PURPOSE OR PERHAPS ACTUATED BY THEIR OWN TERRORS RAN FROM GATE TO GATE CRYING OUT THAT THE CAVALIERS WERE COMING TO BURN THE CITY AND THAT THE KING HIMSELF WAS AT THEIR HEAD
8226-274369-0060 NEXT MORNING CHARLES SENT TO THE MAYOR AND ORDERED HIM TO CALL A COMMON COUNCIL IMMEDIATELY ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK HE HIMSELF ATTENDED ONLY BY THREE OR FOUR LORDS WENT TO GUILDHALL
8226-274369-0061 HE TOLD THE COMMON COUNCIL THAT HE WAS SORRY TO HEAR OF THE APPREHENSIONS ENTERTAINED OF HIM THAT HE WAS COME TO THEM WITHOUT ANY GUARD IN ORDER TO SHOW HOW MUCH HE RELIED ON THEIR AFFECTIONS
8226-274369-0062 AND THAT HE HAD ACCUSED CERTAIN MEN OF HIGH TREASON AGAINST WHOM HE WOULD PROCEED IN A LEGAL WAY AND THEREFORE PRESUMED THAT THEY WOULD NOT MEET WITH PROTECTION IN THE CITY AFTER MANY OTHER GRACIOUS EXPRESSIONS
8226-274369-0063 HE HEARD THE CRY PRIVILEGE OF PARLIAMENT PRIVILEGE OF PARLIAMENT RESOUNDING FROM ALL QUARTERS
8226-274371-0000 YOU SPEAK OF JEALOUSIES AND FEARS LAY YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEARTS AND ASK YOURSELVES WHETHER I MAY NOT LIKEWISE BE DISTURBED WITH FEARS AND JEALOUSIES AND IF SO I ASSURE YOU THAT THIS MESSAGE HAS NOTHING LESSENED THEM
8226-274371-0001 WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE HAVE I VIOLATED YOUR LAWS HAVE I DENIED TO PASS ANY BILL FOR THE EASE AND SECURITY OF MY SUBJECTS I DO NOT ASK WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME
8226-274371-0002 ALL THIS CONSIDERED THERE IS A JUDGMENT OF HEAVEN UPON THIS NATION IF THESE DISTRACTIONS CONTINUE GOD SO DEAL WITH ME AND MINE AS ALL MY THOUGHTS AND INTENTIONS ARE UPRIGHT FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE TRUE PROTESTANT PROFESSION
8226-274371-0003 AND FOR THE OBSERVANCE AND PRESERVATION OF THE LAWS AND I HOPE GOD WILL BLESS AND ASSIST THOSE LAWS FOR MY PRESERVATION NO SOONER DID THE COMMONS DESPAIR OF OBTAINING THE KING'S CONSENT TO THEIR BILL THAN THEY INSTANTLY VOTED
8226-274371-0004 THAT THOSE WHO ADVISED HIS MAJESTY'S ANSWER WERE ENEMIES TO THE STATE AND MISCHIEVOUS PROJECTORS AGAINST THE SAFETY OF THE NATION THAT THIS DENIAL IS OF SUCH DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCE THAT IF HIS MAJESTY PERSIST IN IT
