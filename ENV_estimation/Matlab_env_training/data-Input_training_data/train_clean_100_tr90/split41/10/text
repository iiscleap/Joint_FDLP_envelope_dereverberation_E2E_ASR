2416-152139-0058 THE PEN SPLUTTERED ON THE PAPER A BEAD OF SWEAT SPURTING FROM THE MAN'S FOREHEAD DROPPED TO THE SHEET THERE WAS SILENCE IN THE ROOM A MINUTE PASSED ANOTHER
2416-152139-0059 CARLING'S PEN TRAVELLED HALTINGLY ACROSS THE PAPER THEN WITH A QUEER LOW CRY AS HE SIGNED HIS NAME HE DROPPED THE PEN FROM HIS FINGERS AND RISING UNSTEADILY FROM HIS CHAIR
2416-152139-0060 I GUESS IT'S ALL UP I GUESS I KNEW IT WOULD BE SOME DAY MOYNE HADN'T ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT I STOLE THE MONEY MYSELF FROM THE BANK TO NIGHT I GUESS IT'S ALL UP

2416-152139-0063 AND DROPPED IT BACK ON THE FLOOR AGAIN THERE WAS NO LABEL ON IT BUT IT NEEDED NONE THE STRONG PENETRATING ODOR OF BITTER ALMONDS WAS TELLTALE EVIDENCE ENOUGH IT WAS PRUSSIC
2416-152139-0064 OR HYDROCYANIC ACID PROBABLY THE MOST DEADLY POISON AND THE SWIFTEST IN ITS ACTION THAT WAS KNOWN TO SCIENCE CARLING HAD PROVIDED AGAINST THAT SOME DAY IN HIS CONFESSION FOR A LITTLE SPACE
2416-152139-0065 MOTIONLESS JIMMIE DALE STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT THE SILENT OUTSTRETCHED FORM THEN HE WALKED SLOWLY BACK TO THE DESK AND SLOWLY DELIBERATELY PICKED UP THE SIGNED CONFESSION AND THE STEAMSHIP TICKET HE HELD THEM AN INSTANT
2416-152139-0066 STARING AT THEM THEN METHODICALLY BEGAN TO TEAR THEM INTO LITTLE PIECES A STRANGE TIRED SMILE HOVERING ON HIS LIPS THE MAN WAS DEAD NOW THERE WOULD BE DISGRACE ENOUGH FOR SOME ONE TO BEAR A MOTHER PERHAPS

2436-2476-0026 I GAZED AFTER HIS SMALL WHITE SUITED FIGURE AS HE FOLLOWED ANITA FROM THE SALON AND THINKING OF HER I PRAYED THAT CARTER AND HALSEY MIGHT BE WRONG WHATEVER PLOTTING AGAINST THE GRANTLINE EXPEDITION MIGHT BE GOING ON

2436-2481-0000 DOCTOR FRANK'S FACE HAD GONE WHITE SNAP STOOD LIKE A STATUE OF HORROR THE DECK HERE WAS PATCHED AS ALWAYS WITH SILVER RADIANCE FROM THE DECK PORTS THE EMPTY DECK CHAIRS STOOD ABOUT THE SCREAM
2436-2481-0001 WAS STILLED BUT NOW WE HEARD A COMMOTION INSIDE THE RASP OF OPENING CABIN DOORS QUESTIONS FROM FRIGHTENED PASSENGERS I FOUND MY VOICE ANITA ANITA PRINCE COME ON
2436-2481-0002 HE WAS DASHING FOR THE LOUNGE ARCHWAY DOCTOR FRANK AND I FOLLOWED I REALIZED THAT WE PASSED THE DECK DOOR AND WINDOW OF A TWENTY TWO BUT THEY WERE DARK AND EVIDENTLY SEALED ON THE INSIDE

2436-2481-0014 BUT WHY BY WHOM HAD GEORGE PRINCE BEEN IN HIS OWN ROOM WHEN THE ATTACK CAME I THOUGHT NOW I RECALLED HEARING THE LOW MURMUR OF HIS VOICE IN THERE WITH DOCTOR FRANK
2436-2481-0015 DOCTOR FRANK AND HER BROTHER ARE WITH HER THEY'RE DOING ALL THEY CAN HE TOLD US WHAT HAD HAPPENED ANITA AND GEORGE PRINCE HAD BOTH BEEN ASLEEP EACH IN HIS RESPECTIVE ROOM SOMEONE UNKNOWN

2436-2481-0018 NOR DID PRINCE HER SCREAM AWAKENED HIM
2436-2481-0019 I WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO GET AWAY I WOULD LIE DOWN FOR AN HOUR AND THEN GO TO ANITA'S STATEROOM I'D DEMAND THAT DOCTOR FRANK LET ME SEE HER I WENT TO THE STERN DECK WHERE MY CUBBY WAS LOCATED MY MIND WAS

2436-2481-0022 TORTURED SLEEP I WAS AWAKENED BY THE SOUND OF MY ALARM BUZZER SOMEONE WAS TAMPERING WITH MY DOOR THEN THE BUZZER CEASED THE MARAUDER OUTSIDE MUST HAVE FOUND A WAY OF SILENCING IT BUT IT HAD DONE ITS WORK AWAKENED ME
2436-2481-0023 SOMEONE OUTSIDE TRYING TO UNSEAL THE DOOR IN THE DARKNESS CYLINDER IN HAND I CREPT SOFTLY FROM THE BUNK CROUCHED AT THE DOOR THIS TIME I WOULD CAPTURE OR KILL THIS NIGHT PROWLER
2436-2481-0024 THE SIZZLING WAS FAINTLY AUDIBLE MY DOOR SEAL WAS BREAKING UPON IMPULSE I REACHED FOR THE DOOR JERKED IT OPEN NO ONE THERE
2436-2481-0025 WAS EMPTY BUT I LEAPED AND STRUCK A SOLID BODY CROUCHING IN THE DOORWAY A GIANT MAN
2436-2481-0026 HIS ELECTRONIZED METALLIC ROBE BURNED MY HANDS I LUNGED AGAINST HIM I WAS ALMOST AS SURPRISED AS HE I SHOT BUT THE STAB OF HEAT EVIDENTLY MISSED HIM THE SHOCK OF MY ENCOUNTER SHORT CIRCUITED HIS ROBE HE MATERIALIZED IN THE STARLIGHT A BRIEF
2436-2481-0027 SAVAGE ENCOUNTER HE STRUCK THE WEAPON FROM MY HAND HE HAD DROPPED HIS HYDROGEN TORCH AND TRIED TO GRIP ME BUT I TWISTED AWAY FROM HIS HOLD SO IT'S YOU QUIET GREGG HALJAN I ONLY WANT TO TALK WITHOUT WARNING A STAB OF RADIANCE SHOT FROM A WEAPON IN HIS HAND
2436-2481-0028 IT CAUGHT ME RAN LIKE ICE THROUGH MY VEINS SEIZED AND NUMBED MY LIMBS I FELL HELPLESS TO THE DECK NERVES AND MUSCLES PARALYZED MY TONGUE WAS THICK AND INERT I COULD NOT SPEAK NOR MOVE
2436-2481-0029 AND HEAR HIM I DON'T WANT TO KILL YOU HALJAN WE NEED YOU HE GATHERED ME UP LIKE A BUNDLE IN HIS HUGE ARMS CARRIED ME SWIFTLY ACROSS THE DESERTED DECK
2436-2481-0030 HIS WARNING SIREN RANG OUT TO ALERT THE SHIP HIS SPOTLIGHT CLUNG TO US MIKO RAN WITH ME A FEW STEPS THEN HE CURSED AND DROPPED ME FLED AWAY I FELL LIKE A SACK OF CARBIDE TO THE DECK
2436-2481-0031 MY TONGUE WAS THICK BUT IT MOVED YES I WAS SOON REVIVED I SAT UP WITH DOCTOR FRANK VIGOROUSLY RUBBING ME I'M ALL RIGHT I TOLD THEM WHAT HAD HAPPENED
2436-2481-0032 SHE TOLD US BEFORE SHE DIED DIED I LEAPED TO MY FEET SHE DIED YES GREGG AN HOUR AGO
2436-2481-0033 MIKO GOT INTO HER STATEROOM AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS LOVE UPON HER SHE REPULSED HIM HE KILLED HER IT STRUCK ME BLANK AND THEN WITH A RUSH CAME THE THOUGHT
2436-2481-0034 WE MUST GET HIM I GATHERED MY WITS A SURGE OF HATE SWEPT ME A WILD DESIRE FOR VENGEANCE WHY BY GOD WHERE IS HE
2436-2481-0035 DOCTOR FRANK GRIPPED ME THE CAPTAIN SAID GENTLY WE KNOW HOW YOU FEEL GREGG SHE TOLD US BEFORE SHE DIED I'LL BRING HIM IN HERE TO YOU BUT I'LL KILL HIM I TELL YOU NO YOU WON'T LAD
2436-2481-0036 WE DON'T WANT HIM KILLED NOT ATTACKED EVEN NOT YET WE'LL EXPLAIN LATER THEY SAT ME DOWN CALMING ME ANITA DEAD
2436-2481-0037 THE DOOR OF THE SHINING GARDEN WAS CLOSED A BRIEF GLIMPSE GIVEN TO ME AND TO HER OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AND NOW
248-130644-0000 IT WOULD BE A LITTLE HARD TO BLAME THE RECTOR OF PENNICOTE THAT IN THE COURSE OF LOOKING AT THINGS FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW HE LOOKED AT GWENDOLEN AS A GIRL LIKELY TO MAKE A BRILLIANT MARRIAGE
248-130644-0001 WHY SHOULD HE BE EXPECTED TO DIFFER FROM HIS CONTEMPORARIES IN THIS MATTER AND WISH HIS NIECE A WORSE END OF HER CHARMING MAIDENHOOD THAN THEY WOULD APPROVE AS THE BEST POSSIBLE
248-130644-0002 IT IS RATHER TO BE SET DOWN TO HIS CREDIT THAT HIS FEELINGS ON THE SUBJECT WERE ENTIRELY GOOD NATURED AND IN CONSIDERING THE RELATION OF MEANS TO ENDS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MERE FOLLY TO HAVE BEEN GUIDED BY THE EXCEPTIONAL AND IDYLLIC
248-130644-0003 IN ORDER THAT A MARQUIS MIGHT FALL IN LOVE WITH HER OR TO HAVE INSISTED THAT SINCE A FAIR MAIDEN WAS TO BE SOUGHT SHE SHOULD KEEP HERSELF OUT OF THE WAY MISTER GASCOIGNE'S CALCULATIONS WERE OF THE KIND CALLED RATIONAL
248-130644-0004 AND HE DID NOT EVEN THINK OF GETTING A TOO FRISKY HORSE IN ORDER THAT GWENDOLEN MIGHT BE THREATENED WITH AN ACCIDENT AND BE RESCUED BY A MAN OF PROPERTY HE WISHED HIS NIECE WELL AND HE MEANT HER TO BE SEEN TO ADVANTAGE IN THE BEST SOCIETY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
248-130644-0005 HER UNCLE'S INTENTION FELL IN PERFECTLY WITH GWENDOLEN'S OWN WISHES BUT LET NO ONE SUPPOSE THAT SHE ALSO CONTEMPLATED A BRILLIANT MARRIAGE AS THE DIRECT END OF HER WITCHING THE WORLD WITH HER GRACE ON HORSEBACK OR WITH ANY OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENT
248-130644-0006 THAT SHE WAS TO BE MARRIED SOME TIME OR OTHER SHE WOULD HAVE FELT OBLIGED TO ADMIT AND THAT HER MARRIAGE WOULD NOT BE OF A MIDDLING KIND SUCH AS MOST GIRLS WERE CONTENTED WITH SHE FELT QUIETLY UNARGUMENTATIVELY SURE
248-130644-0007 BUT HER THOUGHTS NEVER DWELT ON MARRIAGE AS THE FULFILLMENT OF HER AMBITION THE DRAMAS IN WHICH SHE IMAGINED HERSELF A HEROINE WERE NOT WROUGHT UP TO THAT CLOSE TO BE VERY MUCH SUED OR HOPELESSLY SIGHED FOR AS A BRIDE WAS INDEED
248-130644-0008 AN INDISPENSABLE AND AGREEABLE GUARANTEE OF WOMANLY POWER BUT TO BECOME A WIFE AND WEAR ALL THE DOMESTIC FETTERS OF THAT CONDITION WAS ON THE WHOLE A VEXATIOUS NECESSITY HER OBSERVATION OF MATRIMONY HAD INCLINED HER TO THINK IT RATHER A DREARY STATE
248-130644-0009 IN WHICH A WOMAN COULD NOT DO WHAT SHE LIKED HAD MORE CHILDREN THAN WERE DESIRABLE WAS CONSEQUENTLY DULL AND BECAME IRREVOCABLY IMMERSED IN HUMDRUM OF COURSE MARRIAGE WAS SOCIAL PROMOTION
248-130644-0010 SHE COULD NOT LOOK FORWARD TO A SINGLE LIFE BUT PROMOTIONS HAVE SOMETIMES TO BE TAKEN WITH BITTER HERBS A PEERAGE WILL NOT QUITE DO INSTEAD OF LEADERSHIP TO THE MAN WHO MEANT TO LEAD AND THIS DELICATE LIMBED SYLPH OF TWENTY MEANT TO LEAD
248-130644-0011 FOR SUCH PASSIONS DWELL IN FEMININE BREASTS ALSO IN GWENDOLEN'S HOWEVER THEY DWELT AMONG STRICTLY FEMININE FURNITURE AND HAD NO DISTURBING REFERENCE TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING OR THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION
248-130644-0012 HER KNOWLEDGE BEING SUCH AS WITH NO SORT OF STANDING ROOM OR LENGTH OF LEVER COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO MOVE THE WORLD SHE MEANT TO DO WHAT WAS PLEASANT TO HERSELF IN A STRIKING MANNER
248-130644-0013 AND TO HAVE THEIR LIVES BLOWN HITHER AND THITHER LIKE EMPTY SHIPS IN WHICH NO WILL WAS PRESENT IT WAS NOT TO BE SO WITH HER SHE WOULD NO LONGER BE SACRIFICED TO CREATURES WORTH LESS THAN HERSELF
248-130644-0014 BUT WOULD MAKE THE VERY BEST OF THE CHANCES THAT LIFE OFFERED HER AND CONQUER CIRCUMSTANCES BY HER EXCEPTIONAL CLEVERNESS
248-130644-0015 THE ARCHERY CLUB AND INVITATIONS TO DINE WITH THE ARROWPOINTS AS THE HIGHEST LIGHTS IN HER SCENERY WAS NOT A POSITION THAT SEEMED TO OFFER REMARKABLE CHANCES BUT GWENDOLEN'S CONFIDENCE LAY CHIEFLY IN HERSELF
248-130644-0016 SHE FELT WELL EQUIPPED FOR THE MASTERY OF LIFE WITH REGARD TO MUCH IN HER LOT HITHERTO SHE HELD HERSELF RATHER HARDLY DEALT WITH BUT AS TO HER EDUCATION SHE WOULD HAVE ADMITTED THAT IT HAD LEFT HER UNDER NO DISADVANTAGES
248-130644-0017 IN THE SCHOOL ROOM HER QUICK MIND HAD TAKEN READILY THAT STRONG STARCH OF UNEXPLAINED RULES AND DISCONNECTED FACTS WHICH SAVES IGNORANCE FROM ANY PAINFUL SENSE OF LIMPNESS
248-130644-0018 AND WHAT REMAINED OF ALL THINGS KNOWABLE SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF BEING SUFFICIENTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THROUGH NOVELS PLAYS AND POEMS ABOUT HER FRENCH AND MUSIC THE TWO JUSTIFYING ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF A YOUNG LADY SHE FELT NO GROUND FOR UNEASINESS
248-130644-0019 AND WHEN TO ALL THESE QUALIFICATIONS NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE WE ADD THE SPONTANEOUS SENSE OF CAPABILITY SOME HAPPY PERSONS ARE BORN WITH SO THAT ANY SUBJECT THEY TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO IMPRESSES THEM WITH THEIR OWN POWER OF FORMING A CORRECT JUDGMENT ON IT
248-130644-0020 WHO CAN WONDER IF GWENDOLEN FELT READY TO MANAGE HER OWN DESTINY THERE WERE MANY SUBJECTS IN THE WORLD PERHAPS THE MAJORITY IN WHICH SHE FELT NO INTEREST BECAUSE THEY WERE STUPID
248-130644-0021 FOR SUBJECTS ARE APT TO APPEAR STUPID TO THE YOUNG AS LIGHT SEEMS DULL TO THE OLD BUT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE FELT AT ALL HELPLESS IN RELATION TO THEM IF THEY HAD TURNED UP IN CONVERSATION IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT NO ONE HAD DISPUTED HER POWER OR HER GENERAL SUPERIORITY
248-130644-0022 WHAT WILL GWENDOLEN THINK IF THE FOOTMAN TROD HEAVILY IN CREAKING BOOTS OR IF THE LAUNDRESS'S WORK WAS UNSATISFACTORY THE MAID SAID THIS WILL NEVER DO FOR MISS HARLETH
248-130644-0023 IF THE WOOD SMOKED IN THE BEDROOM FIREPLACE MISSUS DAVILOW WHOSE OWN WEAK EYES SUFFERED MUCH FROM THIS INCONVENIENCE SPOKE APOLOGETICALLY OF IT TO GWENDOLEN
248-130644-0024 IF WHEN THEY WERE UNDER THE STRESS OF TRAVELING SHE DID NOT APPEAR AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE TILL EVERY ONE ELSE HAD FINISHED THE ONLY QUESTION WAS HOW GWENDOLEN'S COFFEE AND TOAST SHOULD STILL BE OF THE HOTTEST AND CRISPEST
248-130644-0025 IT WAS ALWAYS SHE HERSELF WHO HAD TO BE TOLERANT TO BEG THAT ALICE WHO SAT WAITING ON HER WOULD NOT STICK UP HER SHOULDERS IN THAT FRIGHTFUL MANNER AND THAT ISABEL INSTEAD OF PUSHING UP TO HER AND ASKING QUESTIONS WOULD GO AWAY TO MISS MERRY
248-130644-0026 ALWAYS SHE WAS THE PRINCESS IN EXILE WHO IN TIME OF FAMINE WAS TO HAVE HER BREAKFAST ROLL MADE OF THE FINEST BOLTED FLOUR FROM THE SEVEN THIN EARS OF WHEAT AND IN A GENERAL DECAMPMENT WAS TO HAVE HER SILVER FORK KEPT OUT OF THE BAGGAGE
248-130644-0027 HOW WAS THIS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR THE ANSWER MAY SEEM TO LIE QUITE ON THE SURFACE IN HER BEAUTY A CERTAIN UNUSUALNESS ABOUT HER
248-130644-0028 A DECISION OF WILL WHICH MADE ITSELF FELT IN HER GRACEFUL MOVEMENTS AND CLEAR UNHESITATING TONES SO THAT IF SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM ON A RAINY DAY WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE WAS FLACCID AND THE USE OF THINGS IN GENERAL WAS NOT APPARENT TO THEM
248-130644-0029 THERE SEEMED TO BE A SUDDEN SUFFICIENT REASON FOR KEEPING UP THE FORMS OF LIFE AND EVEN THE WAITERS AT HOTELS SHOWED THE MORE ALACRITY IN DOING AWAY WITH CRUMBS AND CREASES AND DREGS WITH STRUGGLING FLIES IN THEM
248-130644-0030 THIS POTENT CHARM ADDED TO THE FACT THAT SHE WAS THE ELDEST DAUGHTER TOWARD WHOM HER MAMMA HAD ALWAYS BEEN IN AN APOLOGETIC STATE OF MIND FOR THE EVILS BROUGHT ON HER BY A STEP FATHER MAY SEEM SO FULL A REASON FOR GWENDOLEN'S DOMESTIC EMPIRE
248-130644-0031 THAT TO LOOK FOR ANY OTHER WOULD BE TO ASK THE REASON OF DAYLIGHT WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING BUT BEWARE OF ARRIVING AT CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT COMPARISON
248-130644-0032 WHOSE FIRMNESS SHOWED ITSELF IN NO VERY GRACEFUL OR EUPHONIOUS WAY AND WHO WERE NOT ELDEST DAUGHTERS WITH A TENDER TIMID MOTHER COMPUNCTIOUS AT HAVING SUBJECTED THEM TO INCONVENIENCES
248-130644-0033 SOME OF THEM WERE A VERY COMMON SORT OF MEN AND THE ONLY POINT OF RESEMBLANCE AMONG THEM ALL WAS A STRONG DETERMINATION TO HAVE WHAT WAS PLEASANT WITH A TOTAL FEARLESSNESS IN MAKING THEMSELVES DISAGREEABLE OR DANGEROUS WHEN THEY DID NOT GET IT
248-130644-0034 THE FEAR AND THE FONDNESS BEING PERHAPS BOTH HEIGHTENED BY WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE IRIDESCENCE OF HER CHARACTER THE PLAY OF VARIOUS NAY CONTRARY TENDENCIES
248-130644-0035 FOR MACBETH'S RHETORIC ABOUT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF BEING MANY OPPOSITE THINGS IN THE SAME MOMENT REFERRED TO THE CLUMSY NECESSITIES OF ACTION AND NOT TO THE SUBTLER POSSIBILITIES OF FEELING WE CANNOT SPEAK A LOYAL WORD AND BE MEANLY SILENT
248-130644-0036 WE CANNOT KILL AND NOT KILL IN THE SAME MOMENT
248-130652-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE O GENTLEMEN THE TIME OF LIFE IS SHORT TO SPEND THAT SHORTNESS BASELY WERE TOO LONG IF LIFE DID RIDE UPON A DIAL'S POINT STILL ENDING AT THE ARRIVAL OF AN HOUR SHAKESPEARE
248-130652-0001 ON THE SECOND DAY AFTER THE ARCHERY MEETING MISTER HENLEIGH MALLINGER GRANDCOURT WAS AT HIS BREAKFAST TABLE WITH MISTER LUSH EVERYTHING AROUND THEM WAS AGREEABLE
248-130652-0002 THE STILL LIFE IN THE ROOM WHICH SEEMED THE STILLER FOR ITS SOBER ANTIQUATED ELEGANCE AS IF IT KEPT A CONSCIOUS WELL BRED SILENCE UNLIKE THE RESTLESSNESS OF VULGAR FURNITURE WHETHER THE GENTLEMEN WERE AGREEABLE TO EACH OTHER WAS LESS EVIDENT
248-130652-0003 MISTER GRANDCOURT HAD DRAWN HIS CHAIR ASIDE SO AS TO FACE THE LAWN AND WITH HIS LEFT LEG OVER ANOTHER CHAIR AND HIS RIGHT ELBOW ON THE TABLE WAS SMOKING A LARGE CIGAR WHILE HIS COMPANION WAS STILL EATING THE DOGS
248-130652-0004 GAVE A VACILLATING PREFERENCE FIRST TO ONE GENTLEMAN THEN TO THE OTHER BEING DOGS IN SUCH GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY COULD PLAY AT HUNGER AND LIKED TO BE SERVED WITH DELICACIES WHICH THEY DECLINED TO PUT IN THEIR MOUTHS ALL EXCEPT FETCH
248-130652-0005 THE BEAUTIFUL LIVER COLORED WATER SPANIEL WHICH SAT WITH ITS FOREPAWS FIRMLY PLANTED AND ITS EXPRESSIVE BROWN FACE TURNED UPWARD WATCHING GRANDCOURT WITH UNSHAKEN CONSTANCY
248-130652-0006 HE HELD IN HIS LAP A TINY MALTESE DOG WITH A TINY SILVER COLLAR AND BELL AND WHEN HE HAD A HAND UNUSED BY CIGAR OR COFFEE CUP IT RESTED ON THIS SMALL PARCEL OF ANIMAL WARMTH
248-130652-0007 GRANDCOURT LOOKED AT HER WITH UNCHANGED FACE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN TOOK THE TROUBLE TO LAY DOWN HIS CIGAR WHILE HE LIFTED THE UNIMPASSIONED FLUFF CLOSE TO HIS CHIN AND GAVE IT CARESSING PATS ALL THE WHILE GRAVELY WATCHING FETCH
248-130652-0008 WHO POOR THING WHIMPERED INTERRUPTEDLY AS IF TRYING TO REPRESS THAT SIGN OF DISCONTENT AND AT LAST RESTED HER HEAD BESIDE THE APPEALING PAW LOOKING UP WITH PITEOUS BESEECHING SO AT LEAST A LOVER OF DOGS MUST HAVE INTERPRETED FETCH
248-130652-0009 AND GRANDCOURT KEPT SO MANY DOGS THAT HE WAS REPUTED TO LOVE THEM AT ANY RATE HIS IMPULSE TO ACT JUST IN THAT WAY STARTED FROM SUCH AN INTERPRETATION BUT WHEN THE AMUSING ANGUISH BURST FORTH IN A HOWLING BARK
248-130652-0010 THAT THE BRUTE OF A CIGAR REQUIRED RELIGHTING FETCH HAVING BEGUN TO WAIL FOUND LIKE OTHERS OF HER SEX THAT IT WAS NOT EASY TO LEAVE OFF INDEED THE SECOND HOWL WAS A LOUDER ONE AND THE THIRD WAS LIKE UNTO IT
248-130652-0011 TURN OUT THAT BRUTE WILL YOU SAID GRANDCOURT TO LUSH WITHOUT RAISING HIS VOICE OR LOOKING AT HIM AS IF HE COUNTED ON ATTENTION TO THE SMALLEST SIGN AND LUSH IMMEDIATELY ROSE LIFTED FETCH THOUGH SHE WAS RATHER HEAVY
248-130652-0012 SHALL YOU RIDE OR DRIVE TO QUETCHAM TO DAY I AM NOT GOING TO QUETCHAM YOU DID NOT GO YESTERDAY GRANDCOURT SMOKED IN SILENCE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN SAID
248-130652-0013 I SUPPOSE YOU SENT MY CARD AND INQUIRIES I WENT MYSELF AT FOUR AND SAID YOU WERE SURE TO BE THERE SHORTLY THEY WOULD SUPPOSE SOME ACCIDENT PREVENTED YOU FROM FULFILLING THE INTENTION ESPECIALLY IF YOU GO TO DAY
248-130652-0014 SILENCE FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES THEN GRANDCOURT SAID WHAT MEN ARE INVITED HERE WITH THEIR WIVES
248-130652-0015 THEN THERE ARE MISTER HOLLIS AND LADY FLORA AND THE CUSHATS AND THE GOGOFFS RATHER A RAGGED LOT REMARKED GRANDCOURT AFTER A WHILE WHY DID YOU ASK THE GOGOFFS
248-130652-0016 GRANDCOURT LIKE MANY OTHERS HAD TWO REMARKABLY DIFFERENT VOICES HITHERTO WE HAVE HEARD HIM SPEAKING IN A SUPERFICIAL INTERRUPTED DRAWL SUGGESTIVE CHIEFLY OF LANGUOR
248-130652-0017 AND ONE OF YOUR DAMNED MUSICIANS BUT NOT A COMIC FELLOW I WONDER IF KLESMER WOULD CONSENT TO COME TO US WHEN HE LEAVES QUETCHAM NOTHING BUT FIRST CLASS MUSIC WILL GO DOWN WITH MISS ARROWPOINT
248-130652-0018 LUSH SPOKE CARELESSLY BUT HE WAS REALLY SEIZING AN OPPORTUNITY AND FIXING AN OBSERVANT LOOK ON GRANDCOURT WHO NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME TURNED HIS EYES TOWARD HIS COMPANION BUT SLOWLY AND WITHOUT SPEAKING UNTIL HE HAD GIVEN TWO LONG LUXURIANT PUFFS
248-130652-0019 WHEN HE SAID PERHAPS IN A LOWER TONE THAN EVER BUT WITH A PERCEPTIBLE EDGE OF CONTEMPT WHAT IN THE NAME OF NONSENSE HAVE I TO DO WITH MISS ARROWPOINT AND HER MUSIC
248-130652-0020 YOU NEED NOT GIVE YOURSELF MUCH TROUBLE PERHAPS BUT SOME FORMS MUST BE GONE THROUGH BEFORE A MAN CAN MARRY A MILLION VERY LIKELY BUT I AM NOT GOING TO MARRY A MILLION
248-130652-0021 THAT'S A PITY TO FLING AWAY AN OPPORTUNITY OF THIS SORT AND KNOCK DOWN YOUR OWN PLANS YOUR PLANS I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN YOU HAVE SOME DEBTS YOU KNOW AND THINGS MAY TURN OUT INCONVENIENTLY AFTER ALL
248-130652-0022 AND THE DAUGHTER'S LOOKS AND MANNERS REQUIRE NO ALLOWANCES ANY MORE THAN IF SHE HADN'T A SIXPENCE SHE IS NOT BEAUTIFUL BUT EQUAL TO CARRYING ANY RANK AND SHE IS NOT LIKELY TO REFUSE SUCH PROSPECTS AS YOU CAN OFFER HER
248-130652-0023 PERHAPS NOT THE FATHER AND MOTHER WOULD LET YOU DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE WITH THEM BUT I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO DO ANYTHING WITH THEM HERE IT WAS LUSH WHO MADE A LITTLE PAUSE BEFORE SPEAKING AGAIN
248-130652-0024 AND THEN HE SAID IN A DEEP VOICE OF REMONSTRANCE GOOD GOD GRANDCOURT AFTER YOUR EXPERIENCE WILL YOU LET A WHIM INTERFERE WITH YOUR COMFORTABLE SETTLEMENT IN LIFE SPARE YOUR ORATORY I KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO DO
248-130652-0025 WHAT LUSH PUT DOWN HIS CIGAR AND THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS SIDE POCKETS AS IF HE HAD TO FACE SOMETHING EXASPERATING BUT MEANT TO KEEP HIS TEMPER I AM GOING TO MARRY THE OTHER GIRL
248-130652-0026 HAVE YOU FALLEN IN LOVE THIS QUESTION CARRIED A STRONG SNEER I AM GOING TO MARRY HER YOU HAVE MADE HER AN OFFER ALREADY THEN NO SHE IS A YOUNG LADY WITH A WILL OF HER OWN I FANCY
248-130652-0027 EXTREMELY WELL FITTED TO MAKE A RUMPUS SHE WOULD KNOW WHAT SHE LIKED SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOU SAID GRANDCOURT WITH THE GHOST OF A SMILE PERFECTLY TRUE SAID LUSH ADDING AGAIN IN A MARKEDLY SNEERING TONE
248-130652-0028 HOWEVER IF YOU AND SHE ARE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER THAT WILL BE ENOUGH GRANDCOURT TOOK NO NOTICE OF THIS SPEECH BUT SIPPED HIS COFFEE ROSE AND STROLLED OUT ON THE LAWN ALL THE DOGS FOLLOWING HIM
248-130652-0029 LUSH GLANCED AFTER HIM A MOMENT THEN RESUMED HIS CIGAR AND LIT IT BUT SMOKED SLOWLY CONSULTING HIS BEARD WITH INSPECTING EYES AND FINGERS TILL HE FINALLY STROKED IT WITH AN AIR OF HAVING ARRIVED AT SOME CONCLUSION AND SAID IN A SUBDUED VOICE
248-130652-0030 CHECK OLD BOY LUSH BEING A MAN OF SOME ABILITY HAD NOT KNOWN GRANDCOURT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WITHOUT LEARNING WHAT SORT OF MEASURES WERE USELESS WITH HIM THOUGH WHAT SORT MIGHT BE USEFUL REMAINED OFTEN DUBIOUS
248-130652-0031 IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER HE HELD A FELLOWSHIP AND WAS NEAR TAKING ORDERS FOR THE SAKE OF A COLLEGE LIVING BUT NOT BEING FOND OF THAT PROSPECT ACCEPTED INSTEAD THE OFFICE OF TRAVELING COMPANION TO A MARQUESS AND AFTERWARD TO YOUNG GRANDCOURT
248-130652-0032 WHO HAD LOST HIS FATHER EARLY AND WHO FOUND LUSH SO CONVENIENT THAT HE HAD ALLOWED HIM TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER IN ALL HIS MORE PERSONAL AFFAIRS THE HABIT OF FIFTEEN YEARS HAD MADE GRANDCOURT MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF LUSH'S HANDINESS
248-130652-0033 AND LUSH MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF THE LAZY LUXURY TO WHICH HIS TRANSACTIONS ON BEHALF OF GRANDCOURT MADE NO INTERRUPTION WORTH RECKONING I CANNOT SAY THAT THE SAME LENGTHENED HABIT HAD INTENSIFIED GRANDCOURT'S WANT OF RESPECT FOR HIS COMPANION
248-130652-0034 SINCE THAT WANT HAD BEEN ABSOLUTE FROM THE BEGINNING BUT IT HAD CONFIRMED HIS SENSE THAT HE MIGHT KICK LUSH IF HE CHOSE ONLY HE NEVER DID CHOOSE TO KICK ANY ANIMAL BECAUSE THE ACT OF KICKING IS A COMPROMISING ATTITUDE
248-130652-0035 AND A GENTLEMAN'S DOGS SHOULD BE KICKED FOR HIM HE ONLY SAID THINGS WHICH MIGHT HAVE EXPOSED HIMSELF TO BE KICKED IF HIS CONFIDANT HAD BEEN A MAN OF INDEPENDENT SPIRIT
248-130652-0036 BUT WHAT SON OF A VICAR WHO HAS STINTED HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS OF CALICO IN ORDER TO SEND HIS MALE OFFSPRING TO OXFORD CAN KEEP AN INDEPENDENT SPIRIT WHEN HE IS BENT ON DINING WITH HIGH DISCRIMINATION RIDING GOOD HORSES
248-130652-0037 LIVING GENERALLY IN THE MOST LUXURIANT HONEY BLOSSOMED CLOVER AND ALL WITHOUT WORKING MISTER LUSH HAD PASSED FOR A SCHOLAR ONCE AND HAD STILL A SENSE OF SCHOLARSHIP WHEN HE WAS NOT TRYING TO REMEMBER MUCH OF IT
248-130652-0038 SINCE IN HIS OWN OPINION HE HAD NEVER DONE A BAD ACTION IT DID NOT SEEM NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WHETHER HE SHOULD BE LIKELY TO COMMIT ONE IF HIS LOVE OF EASE REQUIRED IT LUSH'S LOVE OF EASE WAS WELL SATISFIED AT PRESENT
248-130652-0039 AND IF HIS PUDDINGS WERE ROLLED TOWARD HIM IN THE DUST HE TOOK THE INSIDE BITS AND FOUND THEM RELISHING
248-130697-0000 ALL THINGS ARE CHANGES NOT INTO NOTHING BUT INTO THAT WHICH IS NOT AT PRESENT MARCUS AURELIUS
248-130697-0001 DEEDS ARE THE PULSE OF TIME HIS BEATING LIFE AND RIGHTEOUS OR UNRIGHTEOUS BEING DONE MUST THROB IN AFTER THROBS TILL TIME ITSELF BE LAID IN DARKNESS
248-130697-0002 AND THE UNIVERSE QUIVER AND BREATHE UPON NO MIRROR MORE IN THE EVENING SHE SENT FOR HIM AGAIN IT WAS ALREADY NEAR THE HOUR AT WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN FROM THE SEA THE EVENING BEFORE
248-130697-0003 AND THE LIGHT WAS SUBDUED ENOUGH WITH BLINDS DRAWN UP AND WINDOWS OPEN SHE WAS SEATED GAZING FIXEDLY ON THE SEA RESTING HER CHEEK ON HER HAND LOOKING LESS SHATTERED THAN WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER BUT WITH A DEEP MELANCHOLY IN HER EXPRESSION
248-130697-0004 WHICH AS DERONDA APPROACHED HER PASSED INTO AN ANXIOUS TIMIDITY SHE DID NOT PUT OUT HER HAND BUT SAID HOW LONG AGO IT IS THEN WILL YOU SIT NEAR ME AGAIN A LITTLE WHILE
248-130697-0005 AND AGAIN TURNED WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION WHICH YET DID NOT ISSUE IN SPEECH THERE WAS SOME FEAR HINDERING HER AND DERONDA WISHING TO RELIEVE HER TIMIDITY AVERTED HIS FACE
248-130697-0006 PRESENTLY HE HEARD HER CRY IMPLORINGLY YOU WILL NOT SAY THAT ANY ONE ELSE SHOULD KNOW MOST DECIDEDLY NOT SAID DERONDA THERE IS NO ACTION THAT OUGHT TO BE TAKEN IN CONSEQUENCE
248-130697-0007 BUT IF I HAD NOT HAD THAT MURDEROUS WILL THAT MOMENT IF I HAD THROWN THE ROPE ON THE INSTANT PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE HINDERED DEATH NO I THINK NOT SAID DERONDA SLOWLY
248-130697-0008 IF IT WERE TRUE THAT HE COULD SWIM HE MUST HAVE BEEN SEIZED WITH CRAMP WITH YOUR QUICKEST UTMOST EFFORT IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO SAVE HIM
248-130697-0009 THAT MOMENTARY MURDEROUS WILL CANNOT I THINK HAVE ALTERED THE COURSE OF EVENTS ITS EFFECT IS CONFINED TO THE MOTIVES IN YOUR OWN BREAST WITHIN OURSELVES OUR EVIL WILL IS MOMENTOUS
248-130697-0010 AND SOONER OR LATER IT WORKS ITS WAY OUTSIDE US IT MAY BE IN THE VITIATION THAT BREEDS EVIL ACTS BUT ALSO IT MAY BE IN THE SELF ABHORRENCE THAT STINGS US INTO BETTER STRIVING I AM SAVED FROM ROBBING OTHERS
248-130697-0011 SHE SPOKE HESITATINGLY I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THEM SAID DERONDA I WAS THINKING TOO MUCH OF THE OTHER THINGS PERHAPS YOU DON'T QUITE KNOW THE BEGINNING OF IT ALL SAID GWENDOLEN SLOWLY AS IF SHE WERE OVERCOMING HER RELUCTANCE
248-130697-0012 THERE WAS SOME ONE ELSE HE OUGHT TO HAVE MARRIED AND I KNEW IT AND I TOLD HER I WOULD NOT HINDER IT AND I WENT AWAY THAT WAS WHEN YOU FIRST SAW ME
248-130697-0013 BUT THEN WE BECAME POOR ALL AT ONCE AND I WAS VERY MISERABLE AND I WAS TEMPTED I THOUGHT I SHALL DO AS I LIKE AND MAKE EVERYTHING RIGHT I PERSUADED MYSELF AND IT WAS ALL DIFFERENT IT WAS ALL DREADFUL
248-130697-0014 THEN CAME HATRED AND WICKED THOUGHTS THAT WAS HOW IT ALL CAME I TOLD YOU I WAS AFRAID OF MYSELF
248-130697-0015 IF YOU DID NOT KNOW HOW MISERABLE I WAS YOU MIGHT BUT NOW IT HAS ALL BEEN NO USE I CAN CARE FOR NOTHING BUT SAVING THE REST FROM KNOWING POOR MAMMA
248-130697-0016 WORTH ANYTHING WORTHY ENOUGH I SHALL ALWAYS BE TOO WICKED TO THE VOICE BROKE OFF HELPLESS DERONDA'S HEART WAS PIERCED HE TURNED HIS EYES ON HER POOR BESEECHING FACE AND SAID
248-130697-0017 I BELIEVE THAT YOU MAY BECOME WORTHIER THAN YOU HAVE EVER YET BEEN WORTHY TO LEAD A LIFE THAT MAY BE A BLESSING NO EVIL DOOMS US HOPELESSLY EXCEPT THE EVIL WE LOVE AND DESIRE TO CONTINUE IN
248-130697-0018 AND MAKE NO EFFORT TO ESCAPE FROM YOU HAVE MADE EFFORTS YOU WILL GO ON MAKING THEM BUT YOU WERE THE BEGINNING OF THEM YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME SAID GWENDOLEN LEANING WITH HER CLASPED HANDS ON THE ARM OF HER CHAIR AND LOOKING AT HIM
248-130697-0019 WHILE HER FACE BORE PITEOUS TRACES OF THE LIFE EXPERIENCE CONCENTRATED IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS THAT NEW TERRIBLE LIFE LYING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEED WHICH FULFILLS A CRIMINAL DESIRE I WILL BEAR ANY PENANCE
248-130697-0020 I WILL LEAD ANY LIFE YOU TELL ME BUT YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME YOU MUST BE NEAR IF YOU HAD BEEN NEAR ME IF I COULD HAVE SAID EVERYTHING TO YOU I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT YOU WILL NOT FORSAKE ME
248-130697-0021 IT COULD NEVER BE MY IMPULSE TO FORSAKE YOU SAID DERONDA PROMPTLY WITH THAT VOICE WHICH LIKE HIS EYES HAD THE UNINTENTIONAL EFFECT OF MAKING HIS READY SYMPATHY SEEM MORE PERSONAL AND SPECIAL THAN IT REALLY WAS
248-130697-0022 AND IN THAT MOMENT HE WAS NOT HIMSELF QUITE FREE FROM A FOREBODING OF SOME SUCH SELF COMMITTING EFFECT HIS STRONG FEELING FOR THIS STRICKEN CREATURE COULD NOT HINDER RUSHING IMAGES OF FUTURE DIFFICULTY
248-130697-0023 TO AN INDEFINITE HOPE ANXIETIES BOTH IMMEDIATE AND DISTANT CROWDED ON HIS THOUGHT AND IT WAS UNDER THEIR INFLUENCE THAT AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE HE SAID
248-130697-0024 AND I AM NOT WITHOUT HOPE THAT MISSUS DAVILOW MAY SHORTLY FOLLOW HIM HER PRESENCE WILL BE THE GREATEST COMFORT TO YOU IT WILL GIVE YOU A MOTIVE TO SAVE HER FROM UNNECESSARY PAIN YES YES I WILL TRY AND YOU WILL NOT GO AWAY
248-130697-0025 NOT TILL AFTER SIR HUGO HAS COME BUT WE SHALL ALL GO TO ENGLAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SAID DERONDA NOT WISHING TO ENTER INTO PARTICULARS
248-130697-0026 GWENDOLEN LOOKED TOWARD THE WINDOW AGAIN WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH SEEMED LIKE A GRADUAL AWAKENING TO NEW THOUGHTS THE TWILIGHT WAS PERCEPTIBLY DEEPENING
248-130697-0027 OR ELSE AT DIPLOW I AM QUITE UNCERTAIN WHERE I SHALL LIVE SAID DERONDA COLORING SHE WAS WARNED BY HIS CHANGED COLOR THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN TOO RASHLY AND FELL SILENT
248-130697-0028 WHEN YOU ARE AMONG YOUR FRIENDS AGAIN YOU WILL DISCERN NEW DUTIES SAID DERONDA MAKE IT A TASK NOW TO GET AS WELL AND CALM AS MUCH LIKE YOURSELF AS YOU CAN BEFORE HE HESITATED
248-130697-0029 BEFORE MY MOTHER COMES SAID GWENDOLEN AH I MUST BE CHANGED I HAVE NOT LOOKED AT MYSELF SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME SHE ADDED TURNING TOWARD HIM IF YOU HAD MET ME NOW
248-130697-0030 SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME FOR THE ONE YOU SAW AT LEUBRONN YES I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU SAID DERONDA MOURNFULLY THE OUTSIDE CHANGE IS NOT GREAT I SHOULD HAVE SEEN AT ONCE THAT IT WAS YOU AND THAT YOU HAD GONE THROUGH SOME GREAT SORROW
248-130697-0031 DON'T WISH NOW THAT YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ME DON'T WISH THAT SAID GWENDOLEN IMPLORINGLY WHILE THE TEARS GATHERED I SHOULD DESPISE MYSELF FOR WISHING IT SAID DERONDA HOW COULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS WISHING
248-130697-0032 WE MUST FIND OUR DUTIES IN WHAT COMES TO US NOT IN WHAT WE IMAGINE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF I TOOK TO FOOLISH WISHING OF THAT SORT I SHOULD WISH NOT THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN YOU BUT THAT I HAD BEEN ABLE TO SAVE YOU FROM THIS
248-130697-0033 YOU HAVE SAVED ME FROM WORSE SAID GWENDOLEN IN A SOBBING VOICE
248-130697-0034 IT WILL BE BETTER FOR ME TO GO NOW SAID DERONDA WORN IN SPIRIT BY THE PERPETUAL STRAIN OF THIS SCENE REMEMBER WHAT WE SAID OF YOUR TASK TO GET WELL AND CALM BEFORE OTHER FRIENDS COME
248-130697-0035 HE ROSE AS HE SPOKE AND SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND SUBMISSIVELY BUT WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER SHE SANK ON HER KNEES IN HYSTERICAL CRYING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM WAS TOO GREAT
248-130697-0036 BEHOLDING A POSSIBLE LIFE WHICH SHE HAD SINNED HERSELF AWAY FROM
250-140277-0000 THIS BOOK OWES ITS ORIGIN TO THE FACT THAT IN THE AUTUMN OF NINETEEN TWENTY ONE THE AUTHORITIES OF MANCHESTER COLLEGE OXFORD INVITED ME TO DELIVER THE INAUGURAL COURSE OF A LECTURESHIP IN RELIGION NEWLY ESTABLISHED UNDER THE WILL OF THE LATE PROFESSOR UPTON
250-140277-0001 NO CONDITIONS BEING ATTACHED TO THIS APPOINTMENT IT SEEMED A SUITABLE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS SO FAR AS POSSIBLE IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE MOMENT SOME OF THE IMPLICITS WHICH I BELIEVE TO UNDERLIE HUMAN EFFORT
250-140277-0002 AND ACHIEVEMENT IN THE DOMAIN OF THE SPIRITUAL LIFE THE MATERIAL GATHERED FOR THIS PURPOSE HAS NOW BEEN ADDED TO REVISED AND TO SOME EXTENT RE WRITTEN
250-140277-0003 OR WHO ARE OFFENDED BY THE RESULTING DEMONSTRATIONS OF CONTINUITY BETWEEN OUR MOST HOMELY AND MOST LOFTY REACTIONS TO THE UNIVERSE MIGHT TAKE TO THEMSELVES THE PLAIN WORDS OF THOMAS A KEMPIS THOU ART A MAN AND NOT GOD THOU ART FLESH
250-140277-0004 AND NO ANGEL SINCE MY SUBJECT IS NOT THE SPLENDOR OF HISTORIC SANCTITY BUT THE NORMAL LIFE OF THE SPIRIT AS IT MAY BE AND IS LIVED IN THE HERE AND NOW
250-140277-0005 NO ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THOSE ABNORMAL EXPERIENCES AND STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH TOO OFTEN REGARDED AS SPECIALLY MYSTICAL ARE NOW RECOGNIZED BY ALL COMPETENT STUDENTS AS REPRESENTING THE UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENTS
250-140277-0006 RATHER THAN THE ABIDING SUBSTANCE OF SPIRITUALITY READERS OF THESE PAGES WILL FIND NOTHING ABOUT TRANCES ECSTASIES AND OTHER RARE PSYCHIC PHENOMENA WHICH SOMETIMES INDICATE HOLINESS AND SOMETIMES ONLY DISEASE
250-140277-0007 FOR INFORMATION ON THESE MATTERS THEY MUST GO TO LARGER AND MORE TECHNICAL WORKS MY AIM HERE IS THE MORE GENERAL ONE OF INDICATING FIRST THE CHARACTERISTIC EXPERIENCES DISCOVERABLE WITHIN ALL GREAT RELIGIONS
250-140277-0008 WHICH JUSTIFY OR ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO THE SPIRITUAL LIFE AND THE WAY IN WHICH THESE EXPERIENCES MAY BE ACCOMMODATED TO THE WORLD VIEW OF THE MODERN MAN AND NEXT THE NATURE OF THAT SPIRITUAL LIFE AS IT APPEARS IN HUMAN HISTORY
250-140277-0009 THE SUCCEEDING SECTIONS OF THE BOOK TREAT IN SOME DETAIL THE LIGHT CAST ON SPIRITUAL PROBLEMS BY MENTAL ANALYSIS A PROCESS WHICH NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE CONDUCTED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A DEGRADED MATERIALISM
250-140277-0010 AND BY RECENT WORK ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF AUTISTIC THOUGHT AND OF SUGGESTION THESE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE A PRACTICAL INTEREST FOR EVERY MAN WHO DESIRES TO BE THE CAPTAIN OF HIS SOUL
250-140277-0011 THE RELATION IN WHICH INSTITUTIONAL RELIGION DOES OR SHOULD STAND TO THE SPIRITUAL LIFE IS ALSO IN PART A MATTER FOR PSYCHOLOGY WHICH IS HERE CALLED UPON TO DEAL WITH THE RELIGIOUS ASPECT OF THE SOCIAL INSTINCTS
250-140277-0012 AND THE PROBLEMS SURROUNDING SYMBOLS AND CULTS THESE CHAPTERS LEAD UP TO A DISCUSSION OF THE PERSONAL ASPECT OF THE SPIRITUAL LIFE ITS CURVE OF GROWTH CHARACTERS AND ACTIVITIES
250-140277-0013 AND A FURTHER SECTION SUGGESTS SOME WAYS IN WHICH EDUCATIONISTS MIGHT PROMOTE THE UP SPRINGING OF THIS LIFE IN THE YOUNG FINALLY THE LAST CHAPTER ATTEMPTS TO PLACE THE FACT OF THE LIFE OF THE SPIRIT IN ITS RELATION TO THE SOCIAL ORDER
250-140277-0014 AND TO INDICATE SOME OF THE RESULTS WHICH MIGHT FOLLOW UPON ITS HEALTHY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT IT IS SUPERFLUOUS TO POINT OUT THAT EACH OF THESE SUBJECTS NEEDS AT LEAST A VOLUME TO ITSELF
250-140277-0015 WARM GRATITUDE FIRST TO THE PRINCIPAL AND AUTHORITIES OF MANCHESTER COLLEGE WHO GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY OF DELIVERING THESE CHAPTERS IN THEIR ORIGINAL FORM AND WHOSE UNFAILING SYMPATHY AND KINDNESS SO GREATLY HELPED ME
250-140277-0016 PSYCHOLOGY AND THE LIFE OF THE SPIRIT TWO CONTEMPLATION AND SUGGESTION
250-142276-0000 CHAPTER TWO ROSES AND THORNS BY THE SOFT GREEN LIGHT IN THE WOODY GLADE ON THE BANKS OF MOSS WHERE THY CHILDHOOD PLAYED BY THE HOUSEHOLD TREE
250-142276-0001 HER MOTHER HAD BEEN DETAINED AT HOME BY A MULTITUDE OF HALF REASONS NONE OF WHICH ANYBODY FULLY UNDERSTOOD EXCEPT MISTER HALE WHO WAS PERFECTLY AWARE THAT ALL HIS ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF A GREY SATIN GOWN
250-142276-0002 WHICH WAS MIDWAY BETWEEN OLDNESS AND NEWNESS HAD PROVED UNAVAILING AND THAT AS HE HAD NOT THE MONEY TO EQUIP HIS WIFE AFRESH FROM TOP TO TOE SHE WOULD NOT SHOW HERSELF AT HER ONLY SISTER'S ONLY CHILD'S WEDDING
250-142276-0003 IF MISSUS SHAW HAD GUESSED AT THE REAL REASON WHY MISSUS HALE DID NOT ACCOMPANY HER HUSBAND SHE WOULD HAVE SHOWERED DOWN GOWNS UPON HER BUT IT WAS NEARLY TWENTY YEARS SINCE MISSUS SHAW HAD BEEN THE POOR PRETTY MISS BERESFORD
250-142276-0004 AND SHE HAD REALLY FORGOTTEN ALL GRIEVANCES EXCEPT THAT OF THE UNHAPPINESS ARISING FROM DISPARITY OF AGE IN MARRIED LIFE ON WHICH SHE COULD DESCANT BY THE HALF HOUR DEAREST MARIA HAD MARRIED THE MAN OF HER HEART
250-142276-0005 ONLY EIGHT YEARS OLDER THAN HERSELF WITH THE SWEETEST TEMPER AND THAT BLUE BLACK HAIR ONE SO SELDOM SEES MISTER HALE WAS ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL PREACHERS SHE HAD EVER HEARD AND A PERFECT MODEL OF A PARISH PRIEST
250-142276-0006 PERHAPS IT WAS NOT QUITE A LOGICAL DEDUCTION FROM ALL THESE PREMISES BUT IT WAS STILL MISSUS SHAW'S CHARACTERISTIC CONCLUSION AS SHE THOUGHT OVER HER SISTER'S LOT
250-142276-0007 MISSUS HALE IF SHE SPOKE TRUTH MIGHT HAVE ANSWERED WITH A READY MADE LIST
250-142276-0008 A WHITE CHIP BONNET OH DOZENS OF THINGS FOR THE WEDDING AND HUNDREDS OF THINGS FOR THE HOUSE MARGARET ONLY KNEW THAT HER MOTHER HAD NOT FOUND IT CONVENIENT TO COME
250-142276-0009 AND SHE WAS NOT SORRY TO THINK THAT THEIR MEETING AND GREETING WOULD TAKE PLACE AT HELSTONE PARSONAGE RATHER THAN DURING THE CONFUSION OF THE LAST TWO OR THREE DAYS IN THE HOUSE IN HARLEY STREET WHERE SHE HERSELF HAD HAD TO PLAY THE PART OF FIGARO
250-142276-0010 AND WAS WANTED EVERYWHERE AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME HER MIND AND BODY ACHED NOW WITH THE RECOLLECTION OF ALL SHE HAD DONE AND SAID WITHIN THE LAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS THE FAREWELLS SO HURRIEDLY TAKEN AMONGST ALL THE OTHER GOOD BYES
250-142276-0011 OF THOSE SHE HAD LIVED WITH SO LONG OPPRESSED HER NOW WITH A SAD REGRET FOR THE TIMES THAT WERE NO MORE IT DID NOT SIGNIFY WHAT THOSE TIMES HAD BEEN THEY WERE GONE NEVER TO RETURN MARGARET'S HEART FELT MORE HEAVY
250-142276-0012 THE PLACE AND THE LIFE SHE HAD LONGED FOR FOR YEARS AT THAT TIME OF ALL TIMES FOR YEARNING AND LONGING JUST BEFORE THE SHARP SENSES LOSE THEIR OUTLINES IN SLEEP
250-142276-0013 HER DEAR FATHER LEANING BACK ASLEEP IN THE RAILWAY CARRIAGE HIS BLUE BLACK HAIR WAS GREY NOW AND LAY THINLY OVER HIS BROWS THE BONES OF HIS FACE WERE PLAINLY TO BE SEEN
250-142276-0014 TOO PLAINLY FOR BEAUTY IF HIS FEATURES HAD BEEN LESS FINELY CUT AS IT WAS THEY HAD A GRACE IF NOT A COMELINESS OF THEIR OWN THE FACE WAS IN REPOSE BUT IT WAS RATHER REST AFTER WEARINESS
250-142276-0015 THAN THE SERENE CALM OF THE COUNTENANCE OF ONE WHO LED A PLACID CONTENTED LIFE MARGARET WAS PAINFULLY STRUCK BY THE WORN ANXIOUS EXPRESSION AND SHE WENT BACK OVER THE OPEN AND AVOWED CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER FATHER'S LIFE
250-142276-0016 TO FIND THE CAUSE FOR THE LINES THAT SPOKE SO PLAINLY OF HABITUAL DISTRESS AND DEPRESSION POOR FREDERICK THOUGHT SHE SIGHING OH IF FREDERICK HAD BUT BEEN A CLERGYMAN INSTEAD OF GOING INTO THE NAVY AND BEING LOST TO US ALL
250-142276-0017 I WISH I KNEW ALL ABOUT IT I NEVER UNDERSTOOD IT FROM AUNT SHAW I ONLY KNEW HE COULD NOT COME BACK TO ENGLAND BECAUSE OF THAT TERRIBLE AFFAIR POOR DEAR PAPA HOW SAD HE LOOKS
250-142276-0018 I AM SO GLAD I AM GOING HOME TO BE AT HAND TO COMFORT HIM AND MAMMA SHE WAS READY WITH A BRIGHT SMILE IN WHICH THERE WAS NOT A TRACE OF FATIGUE TO GREET HER FATHER WHEN HE AWAKENED HE SMILED BACK AGAIN BUT
250-142276-0019 FAINTLY AS IF IT WERE AN UNUSUAL EXERTION HIS FACE RETURNED INTO ITS LINES OF HABITUAL ANXIETY HE HAD A TRICK OF HALF OPENING HIS MOUTH AS IF TO SPEAK WHICH CONSTANTLY UNSETTLED THE FORM OF THE LIPS
250-142276-0020 AND GAVE THE FACE AN UNDECIDED EXPRESSION BUT HE HAD THE SAME LARGE SOFT EYES AS HIS DAUGHTER EYES WHICH MOVED SLOWLY AND ALMOST GRANDLY ROUND IN THEIR ORBITS AND WERE WELL VEILED BY THEIR TRANSPARENT WHITE EYELIDS
250-142276-0021 NO ROSEBUD THAT COULD ONLY OPEN JUST ENOUGH TO LET OUT A YES AND NO AND AN'T PLEASE YOU SIR BUT THE WIDE MOUTH WAS ONE SOFT CURVE OF RICH RED LIPS AND THE SKIN IF NOT WHITE AND FAIR
250-142276-0022 WAS OF AN IVORY SMOOTHNESS AND DELICACY IF THE LOOK ON HER FACE WAS IN GENERAL TOO DIGNIFIED AND RESERVED FOR ONE SO YOUNG NOW TALKING TO HER FATHER IT WAS BRIGHT AS THE MORNING
250-142276-0023 FULL OF DIMPLES AND GLANCES THAT SPOKE OF CHILDISH GLADNESS AND BOUNDLESS HOPE IN THE FUTURE IT WAS THE LATTER PART OF JULY WHEN MARGARET RETURNED HOME THE FOREST TREES WERE ALL ONE DARK FULL DUSKY GREEN
250-142276-0024 THE FERN BELOW THEM CAUGHT ALL THE SLANTING SUNBEAMS THE WEATHER WAS SULTRY AND BROODINGLY STILL MARGARET USED TO TRAMP ALONG BY HER FATHER'S SIDE CRUSHING DOWN THE FERN WITH A CRUEL GLEE
250-142276-0025 AS SHE FELT IT YIELD UNDER HER LIGHT FOOT AND SEND UP THE FRAGRANCE PECULIAR TO IT OUT ON THE BROAD COMMONS INTO THE WARM SCENTED LIGHT SEEING MULTITUDES OF WILD FREE LIVING CREATURES REVELLING IN THE SUNSHINE
250-142276-0026 THIS LIFE AT LEAST THESE WALKS REALISED ALL MARGARET'S ANTICIPATIONS SHE TOOK A PRIDE IN HER FOREST ITS PEOPLE WERE HER PEOPLE SHE MADE HEARTY FRIENDS WITH THEM
250-142276-0027 LEARNED AND DELIGHTED IN USING THEIR PECULIAR WORDS TOOK UP HER FREEDOM AMONGST THEM NURSED THEIR BABIES TALKED OR READ WITH SLOW DISTINCTNESS TO THEIR OLD PEOPLE
250-142276-0028 CARRIED DAINTY MESSES TO THEIR SICK RESOLVED BEFORE LONG TO TEACH AT THE SCHOOL WHERE HER FATHER WENT EVERY DAY AS TO AN APPOINTED TASK BUT SHE WAS CONTINUALLY TEMPTED OFF TO GO AND SEE SOME INDIVIDUAL FRIEND
250-142276-0029 MAN WOMAN OR CHILD IN SOME COTTAGE IN THE GREEN SHADE OF THE FOREST HER OUT OF DOORS LIFE WAS PERFECT HER IN DOORS LIFE HAD ITS DRAWBACKS
250-142276-0030 WITH THE HEALTHY SHAME OF A CHILD SHE BLAMED HERSELF FOR HER KEENNESS OF SIGHT IN PERCEIVING THAT ALL WAS NOT AS IT SHOULD BE THERE HER MOTHER HER MOTHER ALWAYS SO KIND AND TENDER TOWARDS HER
250-142276-0031 BUT EVERY DAY HE WAS MORE OVERPOWERED THE WORLD BECAME MORE BEWILDERING AT EACH REPEATED URGENCY OF HIS WIFE THAT HE WOULD PUT HIMSELF IN THE WAY OF SEEKING SOME PREFERMENT
250-142276-0032 AND MARGARET WOULD TRY TO TEMPT HER FORTH ON TO THE BEAUTIFUL BROAD UPLAND SUN STREAKED CLOUD SHADOWED COMMON FOR SHE WAS SURE THAT HER MOTHER HAD ACCUSTOMED HERSELF TOO MUCH TO AN IN DOORS LIFE SELDOM EXTENDING HER WALKS BEYOND THE CHURCH
250-142276-0033 THE SCHOOL AND THE NEIGHBOURING COTTAGES THIS DID GOOD FOR A TIME BUT WHEN THE AUTUMN DREW ON AND THE WEATHER BECAME MORE CHANGEABLE HER MOTHER'S IDEA OF THE UNHEALTHINESS OF THE PLACE INCREASED
250-142276-0034 AND SHE REPINED EVEN MORE FREQUENTLY THAT HER HUSBAND WHO WAS MORE LEARNED THAN MISTER HUME A BETTER PARISH PRIEST THAN MISTER HOULDSWORTH SHOULD NOT HAVE MET WITH THE PREFERMENT THAT THESE TWO FORMER NEIGHBOURS OF THEIRS HAD DONE
250-142276-0035 THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP MANY LUXURIES WHICH HAD ONLY BEEN TROUBLES AND TRAMMELS TO HER FREEDOM IN HARLEY STREET HER KEEN ENJOYMENT OF EVERY SENSUOUS PLEASURE WAS BALANCED FINELY IF NOT OVERBALANCED
250-142276-0036 BY HER CONSCIOUS PRIDE IN BEING ABLE TO DO WITHOUT THEM ALL IF NEED WERE BUT THE CLOUD NEVER COMES IN THAT QUARTER OF THE HORIZON FROM WHICH WE WATCH FOR IT THERE HAD BEEN SLIGHT COMPLAINTS AND PASSING REGRETS ON HER MOTHER'S PART
250-142276-0037 NOT SO PLEASANT IN THE LATTER HALF OF SEPTEMBER THE AUTUMNAL RAINS AND STORMS CAME ON AND MARGARET WAS OBLIGED TO REMAIN MORE IN THE HOUSE THAN SHE HAD HITHERTO DONE
250-142276-0038 HELSTONE WAS AT SOME DISTANCE FROM ANY NEIGHBOURS OF THEIR OWN STANDARD OF CULTIVATION IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE MOST OUT OF THE WAY PLACES IN ENGLAND SAID MISSUS HALE IN ONE OF HER PLAINTIVE MOODS
250-142276-0039 IF WE ONLY LIVED AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PARISH IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THERE WE SHOULD BE ALMOST WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF THE STANSFIELDS CERTAINLY THE GORMANS WOULD BE WITHIN A WALK GORMANS SAID MARGARET
250-142276-0040 ARE THOSE THE GORMANS WHO MADE THEIR FORTUNES IN TRADE AT SOUTHAMPTON OH I'M GLAD WE DON'T VISIT THEM I DON'T LIKE SHOPPY PEOPLE I THINK WE ARE FAR BETTER OFF KNOWING ONLY COTTAGERS AND LABOURERS
250-142276-0041 I CALL MINE A VERY COMPREHENSIVE TASTE I LIKE ALL PEOPLE WHOSE OCCUPATIONS HAVE TO DO WITH LAND I LIKE SOLDIERS AND SAILORS AND THE THREE LEARNED PROFESSIONS AS THEY CALL THEM
250-142276-0042 AND WITH THE SOFT VIOLENCE OF THE WEST WIND BEHIND HER AS SHE CROSSED SOME HEATH SHE SEEMED TO BE BORNE ONWARDS AS LIGHTLY AND EASILY AS THE FALLEN LEAF THAT WAS WAFTED ALONG BY THE AUTUMNAL BREEZE
250-142276-0043 BUT THE EVENINGS WERE RATHER DIFFICULT TO FILL UP AGREEABLY IMMEDIATELY AFTER TEA HER FATHER WITHDREW INTO HIS SMALL LIBRARY AND SHE AND HER MOTHER WERE LEFT ALONE MISSUS HALE HAD NEVER CARED MUCH FOR BOOKS
250-142276-0044 AND HAD DISCOURAGED HER HUSBAND VERY EARLY IN THEIR MARRIED LIFE IN HIS DESIRE OF READING ALOUD TO HER WHILE SHE WORKED AT ONE TIME THEY HAD TRIED BACKGAMMON AS A RESOURCE BUT AS MISTER HALE GREW TO TAKE AN INCREASING INTEREST IN HIS SCHOOL AND HIS PARISHIONERS
250-142276-0045 HE FOUND THAT THE INTERRUPTIONS WHICH AROSE OUT OF THESE DUTIES WERE REGARDED AS HARDSHIPS BY HIS WIFE NOT TO BE ACCEPTED AS THE NATURAL CONDITIONS OF HIS PROFESSION BUT TO BE REGRETTED AND STRUGGLED AGAINST BY HER AS THEY SEVERALLY AROSE
250-142276-0046 SO HE WITHDREW WHILE THE CHILDREN WERE YET YOUNG INTO HIS LIBRARY TO SPEND HIS EVENINGS IF HE WERE AT HOME IN READING THE SPECULATIVE AND METAPHYSICAL BOOKS WHICH WERE HIS DELIGHT
250-142276-0047 WHEN MARGARET HAD BEEN HERE BEFORE SHE HAD BROUGHT DOWN WITH HER A GREAT BOX OF BOOKS RECOMMENDED BY MASTERS OR GOVERNESS AND HAD FOUND THE SUMMER'S DAY ALL TOO SHORT TO GET THROUGH THE READING SHE HAD TO DO BEFORE HER RETURN TO TOWN
250-142276-0048 NOW THERE WERE ONLY THE WELL BOUND LITTLE READ ENGLISH CLASSICS WHICH WERE WEEDED OUT OF HER FATHER'S LIBRARY TO FILL UP THE SMALL BOOK SHELVES IN THE DRAWING ROOM THOMSON'S SEASONS HAYLEY'S COWPER MIDDLETON'S CICERO
250-142276-0049 WERE BY FAR THE LIGHTEST NEWEST AND MOST AMUSING THE BOOK SHELVES DID NOT AFFORD MUCH RESOURCE MARGARET TOLD HER MOTHER EVERY PARTICULAR OF HER LONDON LIFE TO ALL OF WHICH MISSUS HALE LISTENED WITH INTEREST
250-142276-0050 SOMETIMES AMUSED AND QUESTIONING AT OTHERS A LITTLE INCLINED TO COMPARE HER SISTER'S CIRCUMSTANCES OF EASE AND COMFORT WITH THE NARROWER MEANS AT HELSTONE VICARAGE ON SUCH EVENINGS MARGARET WAS APT TO STOP TALKING RATHER ABRUPTLY
250-142276-0051 ONCE OR TWICE MARGARET FOUND HERSELF MECHANICALLY COUNTING THE REPETITION OF THE MONOTONOUS SOUND WHILE SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT VENTURE TO PUT A QUESTION ON A SUBJECT VERY NEAR TO HER HEART AND ASK WHERE FREDERICK WAS NOW
250-142276-0052 THE FULL ACCOUNT OF WHICH MARGARET HAD NEVER HEARD AND WHICH NOW SEEMED DOOMED TO BE BURIED IN SAD OBLIVION
250-142276-0053 WHEN SHE WAS WITH HER MOTHER HER FATHER SEEMED THE BEST PERSON TO APPLY TO FOR INFORMATION AND WHEN WITH HIM
250-142276-0054 HIS ROOM WAS KEPT EXACTLY AS HE HAD LEFT IT AND WAS REGULARLY DUSTED AND PUT INTO ORDER BY DIXON MISSUS HALE'S MAID WHO TOUCHED NO OTHER PART OF THE HOUSEHOLD WORK
250-142276-0055 BUT ALWAYS REMEMBERED THE DAY WHEN SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED BY LADY BERESFORD AS LADIES MAID TO SIR JOHN'S WARDS THE PRETTY MISS BERESFORDS THE BELLES OF RUTLANDSHIRE
250-142276-0056 ALIAS HER MARRIED LIFE SHE REMAINED WITH HER AND WAS DEVOTED TO HER INTERESTS ALWAYS CONSIDERING HERSELF AS THE GOOD AND PROTECTING FAIRY WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO BAFFLE THE MALIGNANT GIANT MISTER HALE
250-142276-0057 HE WOULD BE DEPRESSED FOR MANY DAYS AFTER WITNESSING A DEATH BED OR HEARING OF ANY CRIME BUT NOW MARGARET NOTICED AN ABSENCE OF MIND AS IF HIS THOUGHTS WERE PRE OCCUPIED BY SOME SUBJECT
250-142276-0058 THE OPPRESSION OF WHICH COULD NOT BE RELIEVED BY ANY DAILY ACTION SUCH AS COMFORTING THE SURVIVORS OR TEACHING AT THE SCHOOL IN HOPE OF LESSENING THE EVILS IN THE GENERATION TO COME MISTER HALE DID NOT GO OUT AMONG HIS PARISHIONERS AS MUCH AS USUAL
250-142276-0059 A SIGNAL WHICH AT ONE TIME HAD OFTEN TO BE REPEATED BEFORE ANY ONE WAS SUFFICIENTLY ALIVE TO THE HOUR OF THE DAY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS AND ATTEND TO HIM NOW MISTER HALE LOITERED ABOUT THE GARDEN IF THE MORNING WAS FINE AND IF NOT
250-142276-0060 HALF CONFIDENTIAL SHAKE OF THE HEAD TO THE PARSON WHO WATCHED HIM AWAY BEYOND THE SWEET BRIAR HEDGE AND PAST THE GREAT ARBUTUS BEFORE HE TURNED INTO THE ROOM TO BEGIN HIS DAY'S WORK WITH ALL THE SIGNS OF A HEAVY HEART
250-142276-0061 NOT ABSOLUTELY BASED ON A KNOWLEDGE OF FACTS IS EASILY BANISHED FOR A TIME BY A BRIGHT SUNNY DAY OR SOME HAPPY OUTWARD CIRCUMSTANCE AND WHEN THE BRILLIANT FOURTEEN FINE DAYS OF OCTOBER CAME ON
250-142276-0062 SHE HAD LEARNT DRAWING WITH EDITH AND SHE HAD SUFFICIENTLY REGRETTED DURING THE GLOOM OF THE BAD WEATHER HER IDLE REVELLING IN THE BEAUTY OF THE WOODLANDS WHILE IT HAD YET BEEN FINE TO MAKE HER DETERMINED TO SKETCH WHAT SHE COULD
250-142276-0063 BEFORE WINTER FAIRLY SET IN ACCORDINGLY SHE WAS BUSY PREPARING HER BOARD ONE MORNING WHEN SARAH THE HOUSEMAID THREW WIDE OPEN THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR AND ANNOUNCED
250-142286-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE MORNING CALLS WELL I SUPPOSE WE MUST FRIENDS IN COUNCIL
250-142286-0001 MISTER THORNTON HAD HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN WORKING UP HIS MOTHER TO THE DESIRED POINT OF CIVILITY SHE DID NOT OFTEN MAKE CALLS AND WHEN SHE DID IT WAS IN HEAVY STATE THAT SHE WENT THROUGH HER DUTIES
250-142286-0002 BUT SHE REFUSED TO LET HIM KEEP HORSES FOR IT THEY WERE HIRED FOR THE SOLEMN OCCASIONS WHEN SHE PAID MORNING OR EVENING VISITS SHE HAD HAD HORSES FOR THREE DAYS NOT A FORTNIGHT BEFORE
250-142286-0003 WHO MIGHT NOW PUT THEMSELVES TO TROUBLE AND EXPENSE IN THEIR TURN YET CRAMPTON WAS TOO FAR OFF FOR HER TO WALK AND SHE HAD REPEATEDLY QUESTIONED HER SON AS TO WHETHER HIS WISH THAT SHE SHOULD CALL ON THE HALES WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR THE EXPENSE OF CAB HIRE
250-142286-0004 THE LAST TIME YOU WERE OUT IN A CAB YOU CAME HOME WITH A HEADACHE FROM THE JOLTING I NEVER COMPLAINED OF IT I'M SURE NO
250-142286-0005 BUT SO MUCH THE MORE I HAVE TO WATCH OVER YOU NOW AS FOR FANNY THERE A LITTLE HARDSHIP WOULD DO HER GOOD SHE IS NOT MADE OF THE SAME STUFF AS YOU ARE JOHN SHE COULD NOT BEAR IT
250-142286-0006 MISSUS THORNTON WAS SILENT AFTER THIS FOR HER LAST WORDS BORE RELATION TO A SUBJECT WHICH MORTIFIED HER SHE HAD AN UNCONSCIOUS CONTEMPT FOR A WEAK CHARACTER AND FANNY WAS WEAK IN THE VERY POINTS IN WHICH HER MOTHER AND BROTHER WERE STRONG
250-142286-0007 MISSUS THORNTON WAS NOT A WOMAN MUCH GIVEN TO REASONING HER QUICK JUDGMENT AND FIRM RESOLUTION SERVED HER IN GOOD STEAD OF ANY LONG ARGUMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH HERSELF SHE FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT NOTHING COULD STRENGTHEN FANNY TO ENDURE HARDSHIPS PATIENTLY
250-142286-0008 WHICH THE UNEASY TENDERNESS OF MISSUS THORNTON'S MANNER TO HER DAUGHTER THE SHAME WITH WHICH SHE THOUGHT TO HIDE THE POVERTY OF HER CHILD IN ALL THE GRAND QUALITIES WHICH SHE HERSELF POSSESSED UNCONSCIOUSLY AND WHICH SHE SET SO HIGH A VALUE UPON IN OTHERS
250-142286-0009 THIS SHAME I SAY BETRAYED THE WANT OF A SECURE RESTING PLACE FOR HER AFFECTION SHE NEVER CALLED HER SON BY ANY NAME BUT JOHN LOVE AND DEAR AND SUCH LIKE TERMS WERE RESERVED FOR FANNY
250-142286-0010 BUT HER HEART GAVE THANKS FOR HIM DAY AND NIGHT AND SHE WALKED PROUDLY AMONG WOMEN FOR HIS SAKE FANNY DEAR I SHALL HAVE HORSES TO THE CARRIAGE TO DAY TO GO AND CALL ON THESE HALES
250-142286-0011 WITH WHAT ASKED MISSUS THORNTON HER BROW SLIGHTLY CONTRACTING
250-142286-0012 MISSUS THORNTON DID NOT SPEAK BUT SHE LAID HER WORK ON THE TABLE AND SEEMED TO THINK IT WILL BE A LONG WAY FOR HER TO WALK BACK AT NIGHT
250-142286-0013 AT THIS POINT MISTER THORNTON CAME IN JUST BEFORE GOING TO THE MILL MOTHER I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT IF THERE IS ANY LITTLE THING THAT COULD SERVE MISSUS HALE AS AN INVALID YOU WILL OFFER IT I'M SURE IF I CAN FIND IT OUT I WILL
250-142286-0014 IT WILL DO YOU GOOD INSTEAD OF HARM
250-142286-0015 HE WENT ABRUPTLY OUT OF THE ROOM AFTER SAYING THIS IF HE HAD STAID A MINUTE LONGER FANNY WOULD HAVE CRIED AT HIS TONE OF COMMAND EVEN WHEN HE USED THE WORDS YOU WILL OBLIGE ME
250-142286-0016 FANNY DON'T SPEAK SO OF YOUR BROTHER HE HAS GOOD REASONS OF SOME KIND OR OTHER OR HE WOULD NOT WISH US TO GO MAKE HASTE AND PUT YOUR THINGS ON
250-142286-0017 BUT THE LITTLE ALTERCATION BETWEEN HER SON AND HER DAUGHTER DID NOT INCLINE MISSUS THORNTON MORE FAVOURABLY TOWARDS THESE HALES HER JEALOUS HEART REPEATED HER DAUGHTER'S QUESTION
250-142286-0018 MISSUS THORNTON WAS SHY IT WAS ONLY OF LATE YEARS THAT SHE HAD HAD LEISURE ENOUGH IN HER LIFE TO GO INTO SOCIETY AND AS SOCIETY SHE DID NOT ENJOY IT
250-142286-0019 AS DINNER GIVING AND AS CRITICISING OTHER PEOPLE'S DINNERS SHE TOOK SATISFACTION IN IT BUT THIS GOING TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH STRANGERS WAS A VERY DIFFERENT THING
250-142286-0020 AS MISSUS THORNTON OBSERVED TO HERSELF SHE LIKED MISSUS HALE'S DOUBLE KNITTING FAR BETTER THAT WAS SENSIBLE OF ITS KIND THE ROOM ALTOGETHER WAS FULL OF KNICK KNACKS WHICH MUST TAKE A LONG TIME TO DUST AND TIME TO PEOPLE OF LIMITED INCOME WAS MONEY
250-142286-0021 MISSUS HALE WAS MAKING RATHER MORE EXERTION IN HER ANSWERS CAPTIVATED BY SOME REAL OLD LACE WHICH MISSUS THORNTON WORE LACE AS SHE AFTERWARDS OBSERVED TO DIXON OF THAT OLD ENGLISH POINT WHICH HAS NOT BEEN MADE FOR THIS SEVENTY YEARS AND
250-142286-0022 WHICH CANNOT BE BOUGHT IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN HEIR LOOM AND SHOWS THAT SHE HAD ANCESTORS SO THE OWNER OF THE ANCESTRAL LACE BECAME WORTHY OF SOMETHING MORE THAN THE LANGUID EXERTION TO BE AGREEABLE TO A VISITOR
250-142286-0023 FIFTEEN SHILLINGS A WEEK AND THREE SAVED OUT OF THEM THOUGHT MARGARET TO HERSELF BUT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY YOUNG SHE PROBABLY HAS FORGOTTEN HER OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE BUT SHE MUST KNOW OF THOSE DAYS
250-142286-0024 MARGARET'S MANNER HAD AN EXTRA TINGE OF COLDNESS IN IT WHEN SHE NEXT SPOKE YOU HAVE GOOD CONCERTS HERE I BELIEVE
250-142286-0025 TOO CROWDED THAT IS THE WORST
250-142286-0026 BUT SURELY IT IS A VERY EASY JOURNEY TO LONDON YES BUT SOMEHOW SAID FANNY LOWERING HER VOICE MAMMA HAS NEVER BEEN TO LONDON HERSELF AND CAN'T UNDERSTAND MY LONGING
250-142286-0027 MAY I INQUIRE MARGARET HAD NOT THE WORDS READY FOR AN ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WHICH TOOK HER A LITTLE BY SURPRISE SO MISS THORNTON REPLIED
250-142286-0028 AS FANNY HAD PUT IT IT DID SEEM AS IF THEY HAD BEEN IMPERTINENTLY DISCUSSING MISSUS THORNTON'S FEELINGS BUT SHE ALSO ROSE UP AGAINST THAT LADY'S MANNER OF SHOWING THAT SHE WAS OFFENDED MISSUS THORNTON WENT ON AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE
250-142286-0029 DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF MILTON MISS HALE HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF OUR FACTORIES OUR MAGNIFICENT WAREHOUSES NO SAID MARGARET I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING OF THAT DESCRIPTION AS YET
250-142286-0030 THEN SHE FELT THAT BY CONCEALING HER UTTER INDIFFERENCE TO ALL SUCH PLACES SHE WAS HARDLY SPEAKING WITH TRUTH SO SHE WENT ON
250-142286-0031 EVERY IMPROVEMENT OF MACHINERY IS I BELIEVE TO BE SEEN THERE IN ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION I AM SO GLAD YOU DON'T LIKE MILLS AND MANUFACTORIES AND ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS SAID FANNY IN A HALF WHISPER
250-142286-0032 SHE WILL DO YOU NO GOOD I SEE THE MOTHER LOOKS VERY ILL AND SEEMS A NICE QUIET KIND OF PERSON
2514-149482-0000 HE RECEIVED FROM MISSUS LOWDER ON THE MORNING AFTER HIS VISIT TO KATE THE TELEGRAPHIC EXPRESSION OF A HOPE THAT HE MIGHT BE FREE TO DINE WITH THEM THAT EVENING AND HIS FREEDOM AFFECTED HIM AS FORTUNATE EVEN THOUGH IN SOME DEGREE QUALIFIED BY HER MISSIVE
2514-149482-0001 EXPECTING AMERICAN FRIENDS WHOM I'M SO GLAD TO FIND YOU KNOW HIS KNOWLEDGE OF AMERICAN FRIENDS WAS CLEARLY AN ACCIDENT OF WHICH HE WAS TO TASTE THE FRUIT TO THE LAST BITTERNESS THIS APPREHENSION HOWEVER WE HASTEN TO ADD
2514-149482-0002 ENJOYED FOR HIM IN THE IMMEDIATE EVENT A CERTAIN MERCIFUL SHRINKAGE THE IMMEDIATE EVENT BEING THAT AT LANCASTER GATE FIVE MINUTES AFTER HIS DUE ARRIVAL PRESCRIBED HIM FOR EIGHT THIRTY MISSUS STRINGHAM CAME IN ALONE
2514-149482-0003 THE LONG DAYLIGHT THE POSTPONED LAMPS THE HABIT OF THE HOUR MADE DINNERS LATE AND GUESTS STILL LATER SO THAT PUNCTUAL AS HE WAS HE HAD FOUND MISSUS LOWDER ALONE WITH KATE HERSELF NOT YET IN THE FIELD
2514-149482-0004 HE HAD THUS HAD WITH HER SEVERAL BEWILDERING MOMENTS BEWILDERING BY REASON FAIRLY OF THEIR TACIT INVITATION TO HIM TO BE SUPERNATURALLY SIMPLE THIS WAS EXACTLY GOODNESS KNEW WHAT HE WANTED TO BE
2514-149482-0005 BUT HE HAD NEVER HAD IT SO LARGELY AND FREELY SO SUPERNATURALLY SIMPLY FOR THAT MATTER IMPUTED TO HIM AS OF EASY ACHIEVEMENT IT WAS A PARTICULAR IN WHICH AUNT MAUD APPEARED TO OFFER HERSELF AS AN EXAMPLE APPEARED TO SAY QUITE AGREEABLY
2514-149482-0006 WHAT I WANT OF YOU DON'T YOU SEE IS TO BE JUST EXACTLY AS I AM THE QUANTITY OF THE ARTICLE REQUIRED WAS WHAT MIGHT ESPECIALLY HAVE CAUSED HIM TO STAGGER HE LIKED SO IN GENERAL THE QUANTITIES IN WHICH MISSUS LOWDER DEALT
2514-149482-0007 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED AS WELL TO ASK HER HOW FEASIBLE SHE SUPPOSED IT FOR A POOR YOUNG MAN TO RESEMBLE HER AT ANY POINT BUT HE HAD AFTER ALL SOON ENOUGH PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS DOING AS SHE WISHED BY LETTING HIS WONDER SHOW
2514-149482-0008 JUST A LITTLE AS SILLY HE WAS CONSCIOUS MOREOVER OF A SMALL STRANGE DREAD OF THE RESULTS OF DISCUSSION WITH HER STRANGE TRULY BECAUSE IT WAS HER GOOD NATURE NOT HER ASPERITY THAT HE FEARED ASPERITY MIGHT HAVE MADE HIM ANGRY
2514-149482-0009 IN WHICH THERE WAS ALWAYS A COMFORT GOOD NATURE IN HIS CONDITIONS HAD A TENDENCY TO MAKE HIM ASHAMED WHICH AUNT MAUD INDEED WONDERFULLY LIKING HIM FOR HIMSELF QUITE STRUCK HIM AS HAVING GUESSED TO SPARE HIM THEREFORE SHE ALSO AVOIDED DISCUSSION
2514-149482-0010 SHE KEPT HIM DOWN BY REFUSING TO QUARREL WITH HIM THIS WAS WHAT SHE NOW PROPOSED TO HIM TO ENJOY AND HIS SECRET DISCOMFORT WAS HIS SENSE THAT ON THE WHOLE IT WAS WHAT WOULD BEST SUIT HIM BEING KEPT DOWN WAS A BORE BUT
2514-149482-0011 HIS GREAT DREAD VERILY WAS OF BEING ASHAMED WHICH WAS A THING DISTINCT AND IT MATTERED BUT LITTLE THAT HE WAS ASHAMED OF THAT TOO IT WAS OF THE ESSENCE OF HIS POSITION THAT IN SUCH A HOUSE AS THIS THE TABLES COULD ALWAYS BE TURNED ON HIM
2514-149482-0012 THE PLACE HOWEVER MUFFLED IN CONVENIENCE AND DECORUM CONSTANTLY HUMMED FOR HIM WITH THAT THICK IRONY
2514-149482-0013 AND HE HAD ALREADY SEEN HOW LITTLE AID CAME TO HIM FROM DENOUNCING THE BRIBES AS UGLY IN FORM THAT WAS WHAT THE PRECIOUS METALS THEY ALONE COULD AFFORD TO BE IT WAS VAIN ENOUGH FOR HIM ACCORDINGLY TO TRY TO IMPART A GLOSS TO HIS OWN COMPARATIVE BRUMMAGEM
2514-149482-0014 THE HUMILIATION OF THIS IMPOTENCE WAS PRECISELY WHAT AUNT MAUD SOUGHT TO MITIGATE FOR HIM BY KEEPING HIM DOWN AND AS HER EFFORT TO THAT END HAD DOUBTLESS NEVER YET BEEN SO VISIBLE HE HAD PROBABLY NEVER FELT SO DEFINITELY PLACED IN THE WORLD
2514-149482-0015 AS WHILE HE WAITED WITH HER FOR HER HALF DOZEN OTHER GUESTS SHE WELCOMED HIM GENIALLY BACK FROM THE STATES AS TO HIS VIEW OF WHICH HER FEW QUESTIONS THOUGH NOT COHERENT WERE COMPREHENSIVE
2514-149482-0016 AND HE HAD THE AMUSEMENT OF SEEING IN HER AS THROUGH A CLEAR GLASS THE OUTBREAK OF A PLAN AND THE SUDDEN CONSCIOUSNESS OF A CURIOSITY SHE BECAME AWARE OF AMERICA UNDER HIS EYES AS A POSSIBLE SCENE FOR SOCIAL OPERATIONS
2514-149482-0017 THE IDEA OF A VISIT TO THE WONDERFUL COUNTRY HAD CLEARLY BUT JUST OCCURRED TO HER YET SHE WAS TALKING OF IT AT THE END OF A MINUTE AS HER FAVOURITE DREAM HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN IT BUT HE PRETENDED TO THIS HELPED HER AS WELL AS ANYTHING ELSE
2514-149482-0018 TO TREAT HIM AS HARMLESS AND BLAMELESS SHE WAS SO ENGAGED WITH THE FURTHER AID OF A COMPLETE ABSENCE OF ALLUSIONS WHEN THE HIGHEST EFFECT WAS GIVEN HER METHOD BY THE BEAUTIFUL ENTRANCE OF KATE THE METHOD THEREFORE RECEIVED SUPPORT ALL ROUND
2514-149482-0019 FOR NO YOUNG MAN COULD HAVE BEEN LESS FORMIDABLE THAN THE PERSON TO THE RELIEF OF WHOSE SHYNESS HER NIECE OSTENSIBLY CAME THE OSTENSIBLE IN KATE STRUCK HIM ALTOGETHER ON THIS OCCASION AS PRODIGIOUS
2514-149482-0020 WHILE SCARCELY LESS PRODIGIOUS FOR THAT MATTER WAS HIS OWN READING ON THE SPOT OF THE RELATION BETWEEN HIS COMPANIONS A RELATION LIGHTED FOR HIM BY THE STRAIGHT LOOK NOT EXACTLY LOVING NOR LINGERING YET SEARCHING AND SOFT
2514-149482-0021 THAT ON THE PART OF THEIR HOSTESS THE GIRL HAD TO RECKON WITH AS SHE ADVANCED IT TOOK HER IN FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND IN DOING SO IT TOLD A STORY THAT MADE POOR DENSHER AGAIN THE LEAST BIT SICK IT MARKED SO SOMETHING WITH WHICH KATE HABITUALLY
2514-149482-0022 AND CONSUMMATELY RECKONED THAT WAS THE STORY THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS FOR HER BENEFICENT DRAGON UNDER ARMS LIVING UP EVERY HOUR BUT ESPECIALLY AT FESTAL HOURS TO THE VALUE MISSUS LOWDER HAD ATTACHED TO HER
2514-149482-0023 HIGH AND FIXED THIS ESTIMATE RULED ON EACH OCCASION AT LANCASTER GATE THE SOCIAL SCENE SO THAT HE NOW RECOGNISED IN IT SOMETHING LIKE THE ARTISTIC IDEA THE PLASTIC SUBSTANCE IMPOSED BY TRADITION BY GENIUS BY CRITICISM
2514-149482-0024 IN RESPECT TO A GIVEN CHARACTER ON A DISTINGUISHED ACTRESS AS SUCH A PERSON WAS TO DRESS THE PART TO WALK TO LOOK TO SPEAK IN EVERY WAY TO EXPRESS THE PART SO ALL THIS WAS WHAT KATE WAS TO DO FOR THE CHARACTER SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN
2514-149482-0025 THINGS ALL PERFECTLY PONDERABLE TO CRITICISM AND THE WAY FOR HER TO MEET CRITICISM WAS EVIDENTLY AT THE START TO BE SURE HER MAKE UP HAD HAD THE LAST TOUCH AND THAT SHE LOOKED AT LEAST NO WORSE THAN USUAL
2514-149482-0026 AUNT MAUD'S APPRECIATION OF THAT TO NIGHT WAS INDEED MANAGERIAL AND THE PERFORMER'S OWN CONTRIBUTION FAIRLY THAT OF THE FAULTLESS SOLDIER ON PARADE DENSHER SAW HIMSELF FOR THE MOMENT AS IN HIS PURCHASED STALL AT THE PLAY
2514-149482-0027 THE WATCHFUL MANAGER WAS IN THE DEPTHS OF A BOX AND THE POOR ACTRESS IN THE GLARE OF THE FOOTLIGHTS BUT SHE PASSED THE POOR PERFORMER HE COULD SEE HOW SHE ALWAYS PASSED HER WIG HER PAINT HER JEWELS EVERY MARK OF HER EXPRESSION IMPECCABLE
2514-149482-0028 AND HER ENTRANCE ACCORDINGLY GREETED WITH THE PROPER ROUND OF APPLAUSE SUCH IMPRESSIONS AS WE THUS NOTE FOR DENSHER COME AND GO IT MUST BE GRANTED IN VERY MUCH LESS TIME THAN NOTATION DEMANDS BUT WE MAY NONE THE LESS MAKE THE POINT THAT THERE WAS STILL FURTHER
2514-149482-0029 TIME AMONG THEM FOR HIM TO FEEL ALMOST TOO SCARED TO TAKE PART IN THE OVATION HE STRUCK HIMSELF AS HAVING LOST FOR THE MINUTE HIS PRESENCE OF MIND SO THAT IN ANY CASE HE ONLY STARED IN SILENCE AT THE OLDER WOMAN'S TECHNICAL CHALLENGE
2514-149482-0030 IT WAS AS IF THE DRAMA IT THUS CAME TO HIM FOR THE FACT OF A DRAMA THERE WAS NO BLINKING WAS BETWEEN THEM THEM QUITE PREPONDERANTLY WITH MERTON DENSHER RELEGATED TO MERE SPECTATORSHIP A PAYING PLACE IN FRONT AND ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE
2514-149482-0031 THIS WAS WHY HIS APPRECIATION HAD TURNED FOR THE INSTANT TO FEAR HAD JUST TURNED AS WE HAVE SAID TO SICKNESS
2514-149482-0032 THAT THE DISCIPLINED FACE DID OFFER HIM OVER THE FOOTLIGHTS AS HE BELIEVED THE SMALL GLEAM FINE FAINT BUT EXQUISITE OF A SPECIAL INTELLIGENCE SO MIGHT A PRACTISED PERFORMER EVEN WHEN RAKED BY DOUBLE BARRELLED GLASSES SEEM TO BE ALL IN HER PART
2514-149482-0033 AND YET CONVEY A SIGN TO THE PERSON IN THE HOUSE SHE LOVED BEST THE DRAMA AT ALL EVENTS AS DENSHER SAW IT MEANWHILE WENT ON AMPLIFIED SOON ENOUGH BY THE ADVENT OF TWO OTHER GUESTS STRAY GENTLEMEN BOTH STRAGGLERS IN THE ROUT OF THE SEASON
2514-149482-0034 WHO VISIBLY PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO KATE DURING THE NEXT MOMENTS AS SUBJECTS FOR A LIKE IMPERSONAL TREATMENT AND SHARERS IN A LIKE USUAL MERCY AT OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE SOCIAL COURSE THEY DISPLAYED IN RESPECT TO THE FIGURE
2514-149482-0035 THAT EACH IN HIS WAY MADE ONE THE EXPANSIVE THE OTHER THE CONTRACTILE EFFECT OF THE PERFECT WHITE WAISTCOAT A SCRATCH COMPANY OF TWO INNOCUOUS YOUTHS AND A PACIFIED VETERAN WAS THEREFORE WHAT NOW OFFERED ITSELF TO MISSUS STRINGHAM
2514-149482-0036 HER COMPANION AT THE LAST MOMENT HAD BEEN INDISPOSED POSITIVELY NOT WELL ENOUGH AND SO HAD PACKED HER OFF INSISTENTLY WITH EXCUSES WITH WILD REGRETS
2514-149482-0037 THIS CIRCUMSTANCE OF THEIR CHARMING FRIEND'S ILLNESS WAS THE FIRST THING KATE TOOK UP WITH DENSHER ON THEIR BEING ABLE AFTER DINNER
2514-149482-0038 NATURALLY AS SHE CALLED IT WHICH WASN'T WHAT HE DID TOGETHER BUT IT WAS ALREADY AS IF THE YOUNG MAN HAD BY AN ODD IMPRESSION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
2514-149482-0039 MISSUS LOWDER HAD MADE DEAR MILLY THE TOPIC AND IT PROVED ON THE SPOT A TOPIC AS FAMILIAR TO THE ENTHUSIASTIC YOUNGER AS TO THE SAGACIOUS OLDER MAN ANY KNOWLEDGE THEY MIGHT LACK MISSUS LOWDER'S NIECE WAS MOREOVER ALERT TO SUPPLY
2514-149482-0040 WHILE DENSHER HIMSELF WAS FREELY APPEALED TO AS THE MOST PRIVILEGED AFTER ALL OF THE GROUP WASN'T IT HE WHO HAD IN A MANNER INVENTED THE WONDERFUL CREATURE THROUGH HAVING SEEN HER FIRST CAUGHT HER IN HER NATIVE JUNGLE HADN'T HE MORE OR LESS PAVED THE WAY
2514-149482-0041 FOR HER BY HIS PROMPT RECOGNITION OF HER RARITY BY PRECEDING HER IN A FRIENDLY SPIRIT AS HE HAD THE EAR OF SOCIETY WITH A SHARP FLASHLIGHT OR TWO HE MET POOR DENSHER THESE ENQUIRIES AS HE COULD
2514-149482-0042 LISTENING WITH INTEREST YET WITH DISCOMFORT WINCING IN PARTICULAR DRY JOURNALIST AS HE WAS TO FIND IT SEEMINGLY SUPPOSED OF HIM THAT HE HAD PUT HIS PEN OH HIS PEN AT THE SERVICE OF PRIVATE DISTINCTION THE EAR OF SOCIETY
2514-149482-0043 THEY WERE TALKING OR ALMOST AS IF HE HAD PUBLICLY PARAGRAPHED A MODEST YOUNG LADY THEY DREAMT DREAMS IN TRUTH HE APPEARED TO PERCEIVE THAT FAIRLY WAKED HIM UP AND HE SETTLED HIMSELF IN HIS PLACE
2514-149482-0044 BOTH TO RESIST HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND TO CATCH THE FULL REVELATION HIS EMBARRASSMENT CAME NATURALLY FROM THE FACT THAT IF HE COULD CLAIM NO CREDIT FOR MISS THEALE'S SUCCESS SO NEITHER COULD HE GRACEFULLY INSIST ON HIS NOT HAVING BEEN CONCERNED WITH HER
2514-149482-0045 MISSUS LOWDER HAD WONDERS TO TELL OF IT THE TWO WEARERS OF THE WAISTCOAT EITHER WITH SINCERITY OR WITH HYPOCRISY PROFESSED IN THE MATTER AN EQUAL EXPERTNESS AND DENSHER AT LAST SEEMED TO KNOW HIMSELF IN PRESENCE OF A SOCIAL CASE
2514-149482-0046 IT WAS MISSUS STRINGHAM OBVIOUSLY WHOSE TESTIMONY WOULD HAVE BEEN MOST INVOKED HADN'T SHE BEEN AS HER FRIEND'S REPRESENTATIVE RATHER CONFINED TO THE FUNCTION OF INHALING THE INCENSE SO THAT KATE
2514-149482-0047 WHO TREATED HER BEAUTIFULLY SMILING AT HER CHEERING AND CONSOLING HER ACROSS THE TABLE APPEARED BENEVOLENTLY BOTH TO SPEAK AND TO INTERPRET FOR HER KATE SPOKE AS IF SHE WOULDN'T PERHAPS UNDERSTAND THEIR WAY OF APPRECIATING MILLY
2514-149482-0048 BUT WOULD LET THEM NONE THE LESS IN JUSTICE TO THEIR GOOD WILL EXPRESS IT IN THEIR COARSER FASHION DENSHER HIMSELF WASN'T UNCONSCIOUS IN RESPECT TO THIS OF A CERTAIN BROAD BROTHERHOOD WITH MISSUS STRINGHAM WONDERING INDEED WHILE HE FOLLOWED THE TALK HOW
2514-149482-0049 IT MIGHT MOVE AMERICAN NERVES HE HAD ONLY HEARD OF THEM BEFORE BUT IN HIS RECENT TOUR HE HAD CAUGHT THEM IN THE REMARKABLE FACT AND THERE WAS NOW A MOMENT OR TWO WHEN IT CAME TO HIM THAT HE HAD PERHAPS AND NOT IN THE WAY OF AN ESCAPE
2514-149482-0050 TAKEN A LESSON FROM THEM THEY QUIVERED CLEARLY THEY HUMMED AND DRUMMED THEY LEAPED AND BOUNDED IN MISSUS STRINGHAM'S TYPICAL ORGANISM THIS LADY STRIKING HIM AS BEFORE ALL THINGS EXCITED AS IN THE NATIVE PHRASE KEYED UP
2514-149482-0051 TO A PERCEPTION OF MORE ELEMENTS IN THE OCCASION THAN HE WAS HIMSELF ABLE TO COUNT SHE WAS ACCESSIBLE TO SIDES OF IT HE IMAGINED THAT WERE AS YET OBSCURE TO HIM FOR THOUGH SHE UNMISTAKEABLY REJOICED AND SOARED
2514-149482-0052 HER LITTLE DRY NEW ENGLAND BRIGHTNESS HE HAD SAMPLED ALL THE SHADES OF THE AMERICAN COMPLEXITY IF COMPLEXITY IT WERE HAD ITS ACTUAL REASONS FOR FINDING RELIEF MOST IN SILENCE
2514-149482-0053 SO THAT BEFORE THE SUBJECT WAS CHANGED HE PERCEIVED WITH SURPRISE AT THE OTHERS THAT THEY HAD GIVEN HER ENOUGH OF IT
2514-149482-0054 HAD REALLY NOT MADE IN HER OWN COUNTRY THE MARK SHE HAD CHALKED SO LARGE IN LONDON
2514-149482-0055 WHILE HE SCARCE KNEW IF HE WERE THE MORE IMPRESSED WITH HER LAUNCHING IT UNDER MISSUS STRINGHAM'S NOSE OR WITH HER HOPE THAT HE WOULD ALLOW TO LONDON THE HONOUR OF DISCOVERY THE LESS EXPANSIVE OF THE WHITE WAISTCOATS PROPOUNDED THE THEORY THAT THEY SAW IN LONDON
2514-149482-0056 FOR ALL THAT WAS SAID MUCH FURTHER THAN IN THE STATES IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME HE URGED THAT THEY HAD TAUGHT THE AMERICANS TO APPRECIATE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT WAS FUNNY SOME NATIVE PRODUCT
2514-149482-0057 BUT IT MIGHT VERY WELL BE THAT NEW YORK IN HAVING HER TO SHOW HADN'T BEEN AWARE OF ITS LUCK THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE NOTHING OVER THERE AND YET WERE AWFULLY TAKEN UP IN ENGLAND JUST AS TO MAKE THE BALANCE RIGHT THANK GOODNESS
2514-149482-0058 THEY SOMETIMES SENT OUT BEAUTIES AND CELEBRITIES WHO LEFT THE BRITON COLD THE BRITON'S TEMPERATURE IN TRUTH WASN'T TO BE CALCULATED A FORMULATION OF THE MATTER THAT WAS NOT REACHED
2514-149482-0059 SHE ANNOUNCED THAT IF THE POINT OF VIEW FOR A PROPER ADMIRATION OF HER YOUNG FRIEND HAD SEEMED TO FAIL A LITTLE IN NEW YORK THERE WAS NO MANNER OF DOUBT OF HER HAVING CARRIED BOSTON BY STORM
2514-149482-0060 IT POINTED THE MORAL THAT BOSTON FOR THE FINER TASTE LEFT NEW YORK NOWHERE AND THE GOOD LADY AS THE EXPONENT OF THIS DOCTRINE WHICH SHE SET FORTH AT A CERTAIN LENGTH MADE OBVIOUSLY TO DENSHER'S MIND HER NEAREST APPROACH TO SUPPLYING
2514-149482-0061 THE WEIRDNESS IN WHICH MILLY'S ABSENCE HAD LEFT THEM DEFICIENT SHE MADE IT INDEED EFFECTIVE FOR HIM BY SUDDENLY ADDRESSING HIM YOU KNOW NOTHING SIR BUT NOT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY FRIEND
2514-149482-0062 HE HADN'T PRETENDED HE DID BUT THERE WAS A PURITY OF REPROACH IN MISSUS STRINGHAM'S FACE AND TONE A PURITY CHARGED APPARENTLY WITH SOLEMN MEANINGS SO THAT FOR A LITTLE SMALL AS HAD BEEN HIS CLAIM HE COULDN'T BUT FEEL THAT SHE EXAGGERATED
2514-149482-0063 BUT WHILE DOING SO HE DEFENDED HIMSELF I CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW ENORMOUSLY MUCH BEYOND HER HAVING BEEN MOST KIND TO ME IN NEW YORK AS A POOR BEWILDERED AND NEWLY LANDED ALIEN
2514-149482-0064 AND MY HAVING TREMENDOUSLY APPRECIATED IT TO WHICH HE ADDED HE SCARCE KNEW WHY WHAT HAD AN IMMEDIATE SUCCESS REMEMBER MISSUS STRINGHAM THAT YOU WEREN'T THEN PRESENT AH THERE YOU ARE SAID KATE WITH MUCH GAY EXPRESSION
2514-149482-0065 THOUGH WHAT IT EXPRESSED HE FAILED AT THE TIME TO MAKE OUT YOU WEREN'T PRESENT THEN DEAREST MISSUS LOWDER RICHLY CONCURRED YOU DON'T KNOW SHE CONTINUED WITH MELLOW GAIETY HOW FAR THINGS MAY HAVE GONE
2514-149482-0066 IT MADE THE LITTLE WOMAN HE COULD SEE REALLY LOSE HER HEAD SHE HAD MORE THINGS IN THAT HEAD THAN ANY OF THEM IN ANY OTHER UNLESS PERHAPS IT WERE KATE WHOM HE FELT AS INDIRECTLY WATCHING HIM DURING THIS FOOLISH PASSAGE
2514-149482-0067 AND BECAUSE OF THE FOOLISHNESS NOT TO MEET HER EYES HE MET MISSUS STRINGHAM'S WHICH AFFECTED HIM WITH HER HE COULD ON OCCASION CLEAR IT UP A SENSE PRODUCED BY THE MUTE COMMUNION BETWEEN THEM AND
2514-149482-0068 REALLY THE BEGINNING AS THE EVENT WAS TO SHOW OF SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY IT WAS EVEN ALREADY A LITTLE THE EFFECT OF THIS COMMUNION THAT MISSUS STRINGHAM PERCEPTIBLY FALTERED IN HER RETORT TO MISSUS LOWDER'S JOKE
2514-149482-0069 OH IT'S PRECISELY MY POINT THAT MISTER DENSHER CAN'T HAVE HAD VAST OPPORTUNITIES AND THEN SHE SMILED AT HIM I WASN'T AWAY YOU KNOW LONG IT MADE EVERYTHING IN THE ODDEST WAY IN THE WORLD IMMEDIATELY RIGHT FOR HIM
2514-149482-0070 AND I WASN'T THERE LONG EITHER HE POSITIVELY SAW WITH IT THAT NOTHING FOR HIM SO FAR AS SHE WAS CONCERNED WOULD AGAIN BE WRONG SHE'S BEAUTIFUL BUT I DON'T SAY SHE'S EASY TO KNOW
2514-149482-0071 AS IF NOW TO KEEP WELL WITH HIM HE ASKED NOTHING BETTER SHE WAS OFF WITH YOU TO THESE PARTS BEFORE I KNEW IT I MYSELF WAS OFF TOO AWAY OFF TO WONDERFUL PARTS WHERE I HAD ENDLESSLY MORE TO SEE
2514-149482-0072 BUT YOU DIDN'T FORGET HER AUNT MAUD INTERPOSED WITH ALMOST MENACING ARCHNESS
2514-149482-0073 SHE'LL THANK YOU FOR THAT SIR SAID MISSUS STRINGHAM WITH A FLUSHED FIRMNESS YET DOESN'T SILENCE IN SUCH A CASE AUNT MAUD BLANDLY ENQUIRED VERY OFTEN QUITE PROVE THE DEPTH OF THE IMPRESSION
2514-149482-0074 HE WOULD HAVE BEEN AMUSED HADN'T HE BEEN SLIGHTLY DISPLEASED AT ALL THEY SEEMED DESIROUS TO FASTEN ON HIM WELL THE IMPRESSION WAS AS DEEP AS YOU LIKE BUT I REALLY WANT MISS THEALE TO KNOW HE PURSUED FOR MISSUS STRINGHAM THAT I DON'T FIGURE BY ANY CONSENT OF MY OWN
2514-149482-0075 KATE CAME TO HIS ASSISTANCE IF ASSISTANCE IT WAS BEFORE THEIR FRIEND HAD HAD TIME TO MEET THIS CHARGE YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT HER NOT BEING EASY TO KNOW ONE SEES HER WITH INTENSITY SEES HER MORE THAN ONE SEES ALMOST ANY ONE BUT THEN ONE DISCOVERS
2514-149482-0076 THAT THAT ISN'T KNOWING HER AND THAT ONE MAY KNOW BETTER A PERSON WHOM ONE DOESN'T SEE AS I SAY HALF SO MUCH THE DISCRIMINATION WAS INTERESTING BUT IT BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THE FACT OF HER SUCCESS AND IT WAS AT THAT COMPARATIVELY GROSS CIRCUMSTANCE
2514-149482-0077 NOW SO FULLY PLACED BEFORE THEM THAT MILLY'S ANXIOUS COMPANION SAT AND LOOKED LOOKED VERY MUCH AS SOME SPECTATOR IN AN OLD TIME CIRCUS MIGHT HAVE WATCHED THE ODDITY OF A CHRISTIAN MAIDEN IN THE ARENA MILDLY CARESSINGLY MARTYRED
2514-149482-0078 IT WAS THE NOSING AND FUMBLING NOT OF LIONS AND TIGERS BUT OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS LET LOOSE AS FOR THE JOKE EVEN THE JOKE MADE MISSUS STRINGHAM UNEASY AND HER MUTE COMMUNION WITH DENSHER TO WHICH WE HAVE ALLUDED
2514-149482-0079 HE WONDERED AFTERWARDS IF KATE HAD MADE THIS OUT THOUGH IT WAS NOT INDEED TILL MUCH LATER ON THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THOUGHT DIVIDING THE THINGS SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF FROM THE THINGS SHE MUST HAVE MISSED
2514-149482-0080 IF SHE ACTUALLY MISSED AT ANY RATE MISSUS STRINGHAM'S DISCOMFORT THAT BUT SHOWED HOW HER OWN IDEA HELD HER HER OWN IDEA WAS BY INSISTING ON THE FACT OF THE GIRL'S PROMINENCE AS A FEATURE OF THE SEASON'S END
2514-149482-0081 TO KEEP DENSHER IN RELATION FOR THE REST OF THEM BOTH TO PRESENT AND TO PAST IT'S EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THAT MAKES YOU NATURALLY A LITTLE SHY ABOUT HER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE BUT WE DO WE'VE SEEN IT AND FOLLOWED IT
2514-149482-0082 WE'VE A LITTLE BEEN OF IT THE GREAT THING FOR HIM AT THIS AS KATE GAVE IT WAS IN FACT QUITE IRRESISTIBLY THAT THE CASE WAS A REAL ONE THE KIND OF THING THAT WHEN ONE'S PATIENCE WAS SHORTER THAN ONE'S CURIOSITY
2514-149482-0083 ONE HAD VAGUELY TAKEN FOR POSSIBLE IN LONDON BUT IN WHICH ONE HAD NEVER BEEN EVEN TO THIS SMALL EXTENT CONCERNED THE LITTLE AMERICAN'S SUDDEN SOCIAL ADVENTURE HER HAPPY AND NO DOUBT HARMLESS FLOURISH
2514-149482-0084 HAD PROBABLY BEEN FAVOURED BY SEVERAL ACCIDENTS BUT IT HAD BEEN FAVOURED ABOVE ALL BY THE SIMPLE SPRING BOARD OF THE SCENE BY ONE OF THOSE COMMON CAPRICES OF THE NUMBERLESS FOOLISH FLOCK GREGARIOUS MOVEMENTS AS INSCRUTABLE
2514-149482-0085 AS OCEAN CURRENTS THE HUDDLED HERD HAD DRIFTED TO HER BLINDLY IT MIGHT AS BLINDLY HAVE DRIFTED AWAY
2514-149482-0086 BUT THE GREAT REASON WAS PROBABLY THE ABSENCE AT THE MOMENT OF A LARGER LION THE BIGGER BEAST WOULD COME AND THE SMALLER WOULD THEN INCONTINENTLY VANISH IT WAS AT ALL EVENTS CHARACTERISTIC
2514-149482-0087 AND WHAT WAS OF THE ESSENCE OF IT WAS GRIST TO HIS SCRIBBLING MILL MATTER FOR HIS JOURNALISING HAND THAT HAND ALREADY IN INTENTION PLAYED OVER IT THE MOTIVE AS A SIGN OF THE SEASON A FEATURE OF THE TIME OF THE PURELY EXPEDITIOUS
2514-149482-0088 AND ROUGH AND TUMBLE NATURE OF THE SOCIAL BOOM THE BOOM AS IN ITSELF REQUIRED THAT WOULD BE THE NOTE THE SUBJECT OF THE PROCESS A COMPARATIVELY MINOR QUESTION ANYTHING WAS BOOMABLE ENOUGH WHEN NOTHING ELSE WAS MORE SO
2514-149482-0089 THE AUTHOR OF THE ROTTEN BOOK THE BEAUTY WHO WAS NO BEAUTY THE HEIRESS WHO WAS ONLY THAT THE STRANGER WHO WAS FOR THE MOST PART SAVED FROM BEING INCONVENIENTLY STRANGE BUT BY BEING INCONVENIENTLY FAMILIAR
2514-149482-0090 THE CREATURE IN FINE AS TO WHOM SPANGLES OR SPOTS OF ANY SUFFICIENTLY MARKED AND EXHIBITED SORT COULD BE LOUDLY ENOUGH PREDICATED
2514-149482-0091 AND THE TONE OF SOCIETY WENT SO FAR AS TO MAKE HIM TAKE UP AGAIN HIS SENSE OF INDEPENDENCE HE HAD SUPPOSED HIMSELF CIVILISED BUT IF THIS WAS CIVILISATION ONE COULD SMOKE ONE'S PIPE OUTSIDE WHEN TWADDLE WAS WITHIN
2514-149482-0092 HE HAD RATHER AVOIDED AS WE HAVE REMARKED KATE'S EYES BUT THERE CAME A MOMENT WHEN HE WOULD FAIRLY HAVE LIKED TO PUT IT ACROSS THE TABLE TO HER I SAY LIGHT OF MY LIFE IS THIS THE GREAT WORLD
2514-149482-0093 THERE CAME ANOTHER IT MUST BE ADDED AND DOUBTLESS AS A RESULT OF SOMETHING THAT OVER THE CLOTH DID HANG BETWEEN THEM WHEN SHE STRUCK HIM AS HAVING QUITE ANSWERED DEAR NO FOR WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME
2514-149482-0094 NOT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT ONLY A POOR SILLY THOUGH QUITE HARMLESS IMITATION WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE PASSED FOR SAYING HOWEVER WAS PRACTICALLY MERGED IN WHAT SHE DID SAY FOR SHE CAME OVERTLY TO HIS AID VERY MUCH AS IF GUESSING SOME OF HIS THOUGHTS
