5561-39621-0045 MY GOOD PARRY SAID HE ORDER A FIRE DRINK EAT SLEEP AND BE HAPPY LET US BOTH BE HAPPY MY FAITHFUL FRIEND MY ONLY FRIEND WE ARE RICH AS RICH AS KINGS
5561-41615-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN A WOULD BE LARK
5561-41615-0001 THE MAJORITY HOWEVER APPEARED TO BE HIGHLY DELIGHTED OVER WHAT THEY HEARD ONE GROUP STANDING NEAR ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF WHICH ELEANOR WAS THE CENTER LAUGHED SO LOUDLY THAT THEY WERE SENT TO THEIR SEATS
5561-41615-0002 AND AS THE MORNING ADVANCED THEY BECAME FULLY AWARE THAT SOMETHING UNUSUAL WAS IN THE WIND SEVERAL TIMES THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF A FOLDED PAPER BEING STEALTHILY PASSED FROM ONE DESK TO ANOTHER BUT AS TO ITS CONTENTS THEY HAD NO IDEA AS IT WAS NOT HANDED TO ANY ONE OF THEM
5561-41615-0003 AT RECESS THERE WAS MORE GROUPING AND WHISPERING AND GRACE WAS PUZZLED AND NOT A LITTLE HURT OVER THE WAY IN WHICH SHE AND HER FRIENDS WERE IGNORED SUCH A THING HAD NOT HAPPENED SINCE THE BASKETBALL TROUBLE THE PREVIOUS YEAR
5561-41615-0004 ELEANOR STARTED THAT PAPER WHATEVER IT IS SAID NORA O'MALLEY TO THE PHI SIGMA TAU WHO STOOD IN A GROUP AROUND HER DESK SHE WAS HERE WHEN I CAME IN THIS MORNING AND I WAS EARLY TOO IT
5561-41615-0005 HERE COMES MABEL SAID JESSICA MAYBE SHE HAS SEEN THE PAPER
5561-41615-0006 MABEL NODDED WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON IT MABEL ASKED GRACE CURIOUSLY MABEL LOOKED DISTRESSED FOR A MOMENT THEN SHE SAID
5561-41615-0007 BUT I GAVE MY WORD OF HONOR BEFORE I READ IT THAT I WOULDN'T MENTION THE CONTENTS TO ANY ONE THEN OF COURSE WE WON'T ASK YOU SAID ANNE PIERSON QUICKLY BUT TELL US THIS MUCH IS IT ABOUT ANY OF US NO REPLIED MABEL IT ISN'T IT IS SOMETHING I WAS ASKED TO SIGN
5561-41615-0008 AND DID YOU SIGN IT ASKED JESSICA I CERTAINLY DID NOT RESPONDED MABEL IT WAS SHE STOPPED THEN FLUSHED
5561-41615-0009 I CAN'T BEAR TO HAVE SECRETS AND NOT TELL YOU
5561-41615-0010 WE DON'T WANT YOU TO TELL IF IT DOESN'T CONCERN US WE DON'T CARE DO WE GIRLS NO INDEED WAS THE REPLY JUST THEN THE BELL SOUNDED AND THE GIRLS RETURNED TO THEIR SEATS WITH THE RIDDLE STILL UNSOLVED
5561-41615-0011 ON WEDNESDAY ASIDE FROM A LITTLE MORE WHISPERING AND SIGNIFICANT GLANCES EXCHANGED AMONG THE PUPILS NOT A RIPPLE DISTURBED THE CALM OF THE STUDY HALL IT WAS THEREFORE A DISTINCT AND NOT ALTOGETHER PLEASANT SURPRISE WHEN MISS THOMPSON WALKED INTO THE ROOM
5561-41615-0012 DISMISSED THE SENIOR CLASS AND REQUESTED THE THREE LOWER CLASSES TO REMAIN IN THEIR SEATS AFTER THE SENIORS HAD QUIETLY LEFT THE STUDY HALL MISS THOMPSON STOOD GRAVELY REGARDING THE ROWS OF GIRLS BEFORE HER HER EYES WANDERED TOWARD WHERE ELEANOR SAT LOOKING BORED AND INDIFFERENT
5561-41615-0013 AND THEN SHE LOOKED TOWARD GRACE WHOSE STEADY GRAY EYES WERE FIXED ON THE PRINCIPAL'S FACE WITH RESPECTFUL ATTENTION I DON'T BELIEVE GRACE IS GUILTY AT ANY RATE THOUGHT MISS THOMPSON THEN SHE ADDRESSED THE ASSEMBLED GIRLS SOMETHING HAS COME TO MY EARS GIRLS SAID THE PRINCIPAL
5561-41615-0014 THAT I FIND HARD TO CREDIT BUT BEFORE YOU LEAVE HERE THIS AFTERNOON I MUST KNOW WHO IS INNOCENT AND WHO IS GUILTY MISS THOMPSON PAUSED AND A NUMBER OF GIRLS STIRRED UNEASILY IN THEIR SEATS WHILE A FEW GLANCED QUICKLY TOWARD ELEANOR WHO WAS LOOKING STRAIGHT AHEAD THE PICTURE OF INNOCENCE
5561-41615-0015 THAT IT IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN FOR ANY PUPIL TO ABSENT HERSELF FROM SCHOOL FOR THE PURPOSE OF ATTENDING A CIRCUS MATINEE OR ANY PUBLIC PERFORMANCE OF THIS NATURE I HAVE SO SEVERELY DISCIPLINED PUPILS FOR THIS OFFENCE THAT FOR A LONG TIME NO ONE HAS DISOBEYED ME
5561-41615-0016 I WAS THEREFORE ASTONISHED TO LEARN THAT A NUMBER OF GIRLS REGARDLESS OF RULES HAVE TAKEN MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS AND HAVE DECIDED TO ABSENT THEMSELVES FROM SCHOOL TO MORROW IN ORDER TO ATTEND THE MATINEE TO BE GIVEN IN THE THEATRE
5561-41615-0017 SUCH A DECISION IS WORSE THAN DISOBEDIENCE IT IS LAWLESSNESS
5561-41615-0018 THE STANDARD OF THE SCHOOL WILL BE LOWERED THEREFORE I INTEND TO SIFT THIS MATTER TO THE BOTTOM AND FIND OUT WHAT MISCHIEVOUS INFLUENCE PROMPTED THIS ACT OF INSUBORDINATION REPORT SAYS THAT THIS MOVEMENT ORIGINATED IN THE JUNIOR CLASS
5561-41615-0019 AND THAT A PAPER HAS BEEN CIRCULATED AND SIGNED BY CERTAIN PUPILS WHO PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO PLAY TRUANT AND ATTEND THE MATINEE TO MORROW THE EYES OF GRACE AND HER CHUMS TURNED QUESTIONINGLY TOWARD MABEL ALLISON WHO NODDED SLIGHTLY IN THE AFFIRMATIVE SO THAT WAS WHAT ALL THE WHISPERING AND MYSTERY HAD MEANT
5561-41615-0020 GRACE INWARDLY CONGRATULATED HERSELF ON HAVING KEPT CLEAR OF THE WHOLE THING NONE OF HER FRIENDS WERE IMPLICATED EITHER EVEN MABEL HAD REFUSED TO SIGN
5561-41615-0021 WHAT I INSIST UPON KNOWING NOW IS WHO ARE THE REAL CULPRITS BEGINNING WITH THE GIRL WHO ORIGINATED THE PAPER TO THE LAST ONE WHO SIGNED IT
5561-41615-0022 HER EXAMPLE WAS FOLLOWED UNTIL TWO THIRDS OF THE GIRLS PRESENT WERE STANDING THE PRINCIPAL STOOD SILENTLY REGARDING THEM WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SEVERITY THAT WAS DECIDEDLY DISCOMFITTING THAT WILL DO SHE SAID CURTLY
5561-41615-0023 AFTER THEY HAD STOOD FOR WHAT SEEMED TO THEM AN AGE BUT WAS REALLY ONLY A COUPLE OF MINUTES YOU MAY BE SEATED THE GIRL WHO COMPOSED AND WROTE THAT AGREEMENT WILL NOW RISE AND EXPLAIN HERSELF WITHOUT HESITATING ELEANOR ROSE AND REGARDED THE PRINCIPAL WITH AN INSOLENT SMILE
5561-41615-0024 I WROTE IT MISS THOMPSON SHE SAID CLEARLY I WROTE IT BECAUSE I WISHED TO
5561-41615-0025 BECAUSE IT HAS SPOILED ALL OUR FUN THERE WAS A GASP OF HORROR AT ELEANOR'S ASSERTION NO ONE HAD EVER BEFORE SPOKEN SO DISRESPECTFULLY TO THEIR REVERED PRINCIPAL MISS SAVELL SAID THE PRINCIPAL QUIETLY ALTHOUGH HER FLASHING EYES AND SET LIPS SHOWED THAT SHE WAS VERY ANGRY
5561-41615-0026 IF YOU HAVE THAT PAPER IN YOUR POSSESSION BRING IT TO ME AT ONCE AND NEVER ANSWER ME AGAIN AS YOU DID JUST NOW YOU ARE BOTH DISRESPECTFUL AND IMPERTINENT BUT MISS THOMPSON'S ANGER TOWARD ELEANOR WAS NOTHING COMPARED WITH THE TEMPEST THAT THE PRINCIPAL HAD AROUSED IN ELEANOR
5561-41615-0027 THE LATTER FLUSHED THEN TURNED PERFECTLY WHITE WITH RAGE STILL STANDING SHE REACHED DOWN
5561-41615-0028 WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS MY CONTEMPT FOR THEM AND RIGHT HERE I ACCUSE GRACE HARLOWE AND HER SORORITY OF GETTING THE INFORMATION FROM MABEL ALLISON YESTERDAY AND CARRYING IT TO YOU THEY ARE ALL TALE BEARERS AND SNEAKS
5561-41615-0029 WITH THESE WORDS ELEANOR ANGRILY FLUNG THE BOOK SHE HELD ON THE DESK AND WALKED DOWN THE AISLE TOWARD THE DOOR BUT MISS THOMPSON BARRED HER WAY STOP MISS SAVELL SHE COMMANDED
5561-41615-0030 I WILL NOT TOLERATE SUCH BEHAVIOR ELEANOR GLARED AT THE PRINCIPAL WHOSE FACE WAS RIGID IN ITS PURPOSE THEN SANK INTO THE NEAREST VACANT SEAT SAYING DEFIANTLY YOU MAY KEEP ME HERE ALL NIGHT IF YOU LIKE
5561-41615-0031 NEVERTHELESS SHE DID NOT AGAIN ATTEMPT TO LEAVE THE ROOM SHE HAD MET WITH A WILL STRONGER THAN HER OWN AND SHE REALIZED IT IGNORING ELEANOR'S FINAL REMARK MISS THOMPSON ONCE MORE TURNED HER ATTENTION TO THE MATTER IN HAND
5561-41615-0032 THOSE GIRLS WHO ARE NOT IN ANY WAY IMPLICATED IN THIS MATTER ARE DISMISSED SHE SAID ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE GIRLS AROSE AND PREPARED TO LEAVE THE STUDY HALL THE PHI SIGMA TAU BEING AMONG THE NUMBER
5561-41615-0033 GRACE MOTIONED THE GIRLS TO HURRY SHE WISHED TO LEAVE THE ROOM WITH HER FRIENDS BEFORE MISS THOMPSON NOTICED THEM SHE KNEW THE PRINCIPAL WOULD INSIST ON AN APOLOGY FROM ELEANOR AND NEITHER SHE NOR HER FRIENDS WISHED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE ELEANOR HAD CHOSEN TO CUT THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
5561-41615-0034 GRACE WAS THOROUGHLY ANGRY WITH HER SHE COULD NOT FORGIVE ELEANOR FOR HAVING ACCUSED HER AND HER FRIENDS OF CARRYING TALES BEFORE ALMOST THE ENTIRE SCHOOL THEREFORE A FORCED APOLOGY WOULD NOT APPEASE HER WOUNDED PRIDE
5561-41615-0035 SHE DREW A BREATH OF RELIEF WHEN THE EIGHT GIRLS WERE SAFELY OUTSIDE THE STUDY HALL DOOR HURRY UP SHE SAID WE'LL TALK WHEN WE GET OUTSIDE SCHOOL DON'T STOP FOR A MINUTE IF MISS THOMPSON NOTICES THAT WE ARE GONE SHE'LL SEND AFTER US
5561-41615-0036 THE GIRLS SILENTLY DONNED THEIR WRAPS AND FLED FROM THE BUILDING LIKE FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE ONCE ON THE STREET A LIVELY CONFAB ENSUED ALL TALKING AT ONCE LET'S TAKE TURNS TALKING CRIED GRACE LAUGHING WE SHALL UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER A LITTLE BETTER
5561-41615-0037 SHE HAS CERTAINLY SHOWN HER TRUE COLORS THIS TIME I NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING MORE UNJUST THAN THE WAY SHE ACCUSED US WHEN WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HER OLD PLAN SAID MARIAN BARBER IT WAS ABOMINABLE SAID EVA ALLEN THE OTHER GIRLS EXPRESSED THEIR DISAPPROVAL IN EQUALLY FRANK TERMS
5561-41615-0038 I SUPPOSE IT DID LOOK AS THOUGH I TOLD YOU GIRLS SAID MABEL ALLISON WHO HAD JOINED THEM AT THE GATE YOU KNOW I WAS WITH YOU AT RECESS RIGHT AFTER THE PAPER HAD BEEN PASSED TO ME
5561-41615-0039 IT WAS PASSED TO ME BY MISTAKE VERY LIKELY AGREED GRACE I WONDER WHO DID TELL MISS THOMPSON I SAW SEVERAL GIRLS WITH THE PAPER
5561-41615-0040 THERE WILL BE WEEPING AND WAILING IN THE SKULL AND CROSSBONES CROWD EXCLAIMED NORA THEY ARE ALL IN THIS MIX UP AND IF THEY AREN'T SUSPENDED THEY'LL BE LUCKY
5561-41615-0041 NO SAID GRACE SHORTLY SHE DESERVES TO BE PUNISHED THE THINGS SHE SAID TO MISS THOMPSON WERE DISGRACEFUL AND I SHALL NEVER FORGIVE HER FOR THE WAY SHE SPOKE OF US I WOULDN'T SAY THAT GRACE REMARKED ANNE YOU CAN NEVER TELL WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO CHANGE YOUR VIEWS
5561-41615-0042 IT WILL HAVE TO BE SOMETHING REMARKABLE IN THIS INSTANCE REPLIED GRACE GRIMLY AS SHE BADE THE GIRLS GOOD BYE REMEMBER GIRLS BASKETBALL PRACTICE AGAIN TO MORROW AND THE REST OF THE WEEK MISS THOMPSON HAS PROMISED ME THE GYMNASIUM PLEASE MAKE IT A POINT TO BE ON HAND
5561-41615-0043 GOOD BYE GRACE CHORUSED HER FRIENDS AND WENT ON DOWN THE STREET DISCUSSING THE PROBABLE FATE OF THE WOULD BE TRUANTS TO RETURN TO THOSE YOUTHFUL TRANSGRESSORS THEY WERE SPENDING A MOST UNCOMFORTABLE HALF HOUR WITH MISS THOMPSON SHE WAS MERCILESS IN HER DENUNCIATION OF THEIR CONDUCT
5561-41615-0044 AND THE TERROR OF SUSPENSION AROSE IN MORE THAN ONE MIND AS THEY LISTENED TO HER SCATHING REMARKS
5561-41615-0045 BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT IT NOW WHEN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ELEANOR THE PRINCIPAL DISMISSED THEM THEY FILED DECOROUSLY OUT VERY UNEASY IN MIND MISS THOMPSON HAD TAKEN THEIR NAMES BUT HAD NOT STATED THEIR PUNISHMENT AND IT WAS CERTAIN THAT THEY WOULD BE MADE TO FEEL THE FULL WEIGHT OF HER DISPLEASURE
5561-41615-0046 WHEN THE LAST GIRL HAD DISAPPEARED THE PRINCIPAL TURNED TO ELEANOR
5561-41615-0047 DO YOU INTEND TO OBEY ME MISS SAVELL ASKED MISS THOMPSON STILL THERE WAS NO ANSWER VERY WELL CONTINUED MISS THOMPSON YOUR SILENCE INDICATES THAT YOU ARE STILL INSUBORDINATE YOU MAY THEREFORE CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO THINGS
5561-41615-0048 YOU MAY APOLOGIZE TO ME NOW AND TO MORROW TO THE GIRLS YOU HAVE ACCUSED OF TREACHERY
5561-41616-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE JUNIORS FOREVER WHEN THE FOUR CLASSES ASSEMBLED THURSDAY MORNING EVERY GIRL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ELEANOR WAS IN HER SEAT
5561-41616-0001 AFTER CONDUCTING OPENING EXERCISES MISS THOMPSON PRONOUNCED SENTENCE ON THE CULPRITS THEY WERE TO FORFEIT THEIR RECESS LIBRARY AND ALL OTHER PRIVILEGES UNTIL THE END OF THE TERM
5561-41616-0002 THEY MUST TURN IN TWO THEMES EVERY WEEK OF NOT LESS THAN SIX HUNDRED WORDS ON CERTAIN SUBJECTS TO BE ASSIGNED TO THEM IF DURING THIS TIME ANY ONE OF THEM SHOULD BE REPORTED FOR A MISDEMEANOR THEY WERE TO BE SUSPENDED WITHOUT DELAY
5561-41616-0003 THEIR PENALTY WAS FAR FROM LIGHT BUT THEY HAD NOT BEEN SUSPENDED AND SO THEY RESOLVED TO ENDURE IT AS BEST THEY MIGHT GRACE HARLOWE FELT A LOAD LIFTED FROM HER MIND WHEN MISS THOMPSON PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED THAT SHE HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION FROM EITHER MABEL ALLISON OR THE PHI SIGMA TAU
5561-41616-0004 THANK GOODNESS NONE OF US WERE CONCERNED IN THAT AFFAIR SHE TOLD THE MEMBERS OF HER BASKETBALL TEAM AT RECESS THERE ARE TWO GIRLS ON THE SOPHOMORE AND THREE ON THE FRESHMAN TEAM WHOSE BASKETBALL ARDOR WILL HAVE TO COOL UNTIL AFTER THE MID YEAR EXAMS

5561-41616-0011 I FEEL SURE THAT SHE DIDN'T AND I AM JUST AS SURE THAT SHE WON'T GET BACK UNTIL SHE DOES WE SHALL MANAGE TO EXIST IF SHE DOESN'T SAID JESSICA DRYLY
5561-41616-0012 SHE FELT A PERSONAL GRUDGE AGAINST ELEANOR FOR HER ACCUSATION AGAINST MABEL WHO HAD GROWN VERY DEAR TO HER AND WHOM SHE MOTHERED LIKE A HEN WITH ONE CHICKEN SHE'LL PROBABLY APPEAR AT THE GAME IN ALL HER GLORY SAID MIRIAM NESBIT
5561-41616-0013 THE RECESS BELL CUT SHORT THE CONVERSATION AND THE GIRLS RETURNED TO THEIR DESKS WITH FAR BETTER IDEAS OF THE COMING GAME THAN OF THE AFTERNOON'S LESSONS SATURDAY DECEMBER TWELFTH DAWNED COLD AND CLEAR AND THE GIRLS ON BOTH TEAMS WERE IN HIGH SPIRITS AS THEY HUSTLED INTO THEIR RESPECTIVE LOCKER ROOMS

5652-19215-0002 SHE IS WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE MOST CHARMING GIRL THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE LATER ON SHE'LL HAVE VIRTUES WITH AN ODOR OF VIOLETS HOW GRACEFUL ONE CANNOT LIVE OTHERWISE THAN NOBLY WITH SUCH A CREATURE
5652-19215-0003 MARIUS MY BOY YOU ARE A BARON YOU ARE RICH DON'T GO TO PETTIFOGGING I BEG OF YOU
5652-19215-0004 THE TRANSITION HAD NOT BEEN SOFTENED AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN STUNNED HAD THEY NOT BEEN DAZZLED BY IT DO YOU UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT IT SAID MARIUS TO COSETTE NO REPLIED COSETTE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE GOOD GOD IS CARING FOR US
5652-19215-0005 JEAN VALJEAN DID EVERYTHING SMOOTHED AWAY EVERY DIFFICULTY ARRANGED EVERYTHING MADE EVERYTHING EASY
5652-19215-0006 AND APPARENTLY WITH AS MUCH JOY AS COSETTE HERSELF AS HE HAD BEEN A MAYOR HE UNDERSTOOD HOW TO SOLVE THAT DELICATE PROBLEM
5652-19215-0007 A SURE MEANS OF NOT ENCOUNTERING ANY OBJECTIONS COSETTE WAS THE ONLY SCION OF AN EXTINCT FAMILY COSETTE WAS NOT HIS OWN DAUGHTER BUT THE DAUGHTER OF THE OTHER FAUCHELEVENT TWO BROTHERS FAUCHELEVENT HAD BEEN GARDENERS TO THE CONVENT
5652-19215-0008 PICPUS INQUIRY WAS MADE AT THAT CONVENT THE VERY BEST INFORMATION AND THE MOST RESPECTABLE REFERENCES ABOUNDED THE GOOD NUNS NOT VERY APT AND BUT LITTLE INCLINED TO FATHOM QUESTIONS OF PATERNITY
5652-19215-0009 OF WHICH OF THE TWO FAUCHELEVENTS COSETTE WAS THE DAUGHTER THEY SAID WHAT WAS WANTED AND THEY SAID IT WITH ZEAL AN ACTE DE NOTORIETE WAS DRAWN UP COSETTE BECAME IN THE EYES OF THE LAW MADEMOISELLE EUPHRASIE FAUCHELEVENT
5652-19215-0010 SHE WAS DECLARED AN ORPHAN BOTH FATHER AND MOTHER BEING DEAD
5652-19215-0011 THAT HE WAS APPOINTED UNDER THE NAME OF FAUCHELEVENT AS COSETTE'S GUARDIAN
5652-19215-0012 AS FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND FRANCS THEY CONSTITUTED A LEGACY BEQUEATHED TO COSETTE BY A DEAD PERSON WHO DESIRED TO REMAIN UNKNOWN THE ORIGINAL LEGACY HAD CONSISTED OF FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR THOUSAND FRANCS
5652-19215-0013 BUT TEN THOUSAND FRANCS HAD BEEN EXPENDED ON THE EDUCATION OF MADEMOISELLE EUPHRASIE FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS OF THAT AMOUNT HAVING BEEN PAID TO THE CONVENT THIS LEGACY DEPOSITED IN THE HANDS OF A THIRD PARTY
5652-19215-0014 WAS TO BE TURNED OVER TO COSETTE AT HER MAJORITY OR AT THE DATE OF HER MARRIAGE THIS TAKEN AS A WHOLE WAS VERY ACCEPTABLE AS THE READER WILL PERCEIVE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SUM DUE WAS HALF A MILLION THERE WERE SOME PECULIARITIES HERE AND THERE IT IS TRUE
5652-19215-0015 THAT THE CLOUD DID NOT LAST LONG SHE HAD MARIUS THE YOUNG MAN ARRIVED THE OLD MAN WAS EFFACED SUCH IS LIFE AND THEN COSETTE HAD FOR LONG YEARS BEEN HABITUATED TO SEEING ENIGMAS AROUND HER
5652-19215-0016 A MYSTERIOUS CHILDHOOD IS ALWAYS PREPARED FOR CERTAIN RENUNCIATIONS
5652-19215-0017 IT IS TRUE THAT HE OVERWHELMED HER WITH GALLANT COMPLIMENTS AND PRESENTS WHILE JEAN VALJEAN WAS BUILDING UP FOR COSETTE A NORMAL SITUATION IN SOCIETY AND AN UNASSAILABLE STATUS
5652-19215-0018 NOTHING SO AMUSED HIM AS BEING MAGNIFICENT HE HAD GIVEN TO COSETTE
5652-19215-0019 DAUPHINES WITHOUT A RIGHT OR WRONG SIDE IN THE PIECE

5652-19215-0022 WITH WINGS OF MECHLIN LACE THE INTOXICATION OF THE LOVERS WAS ONLY EQUALLED AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID BY THE ECSTASY OF THE GRANDFATHER
5652-19215-0023 EVERY MORNING A FRESH OFFERING OF BRIC A BRAC FROM THE GRANDFATHER TO COSETTE ALL POSSIBLE KNICKKNACKS GLITTERED AROUND HER ONE DAY MARIUS WHO WAS FOND OF TALKING GRAVELY IN THE MIDST OF HIS BLISS SAID
5652-19215-0024 THE MEN OF THE REVOLUTION ARE SO GREAT THAT THEY HAVE THE PRESTIGE OF THE AGES LIKE CATO
5652-19215-0025 THANKS MARIUS THAT IS PRECISELY THE IDEA OF WHICH I WAS IN SEARCH AND ON THE FOLLOWING DAY A MAGNIFICENT DRESS OF TEA ROSE COLORED MOIRE ANTIQUE WAS ADDED TO COSETTE'S WEDDING PRESENTS

5652-19215-0027 I REMEMBER TO HAVE SEEN IN THE CATHEDRAL OF STRASBURG A CLOCK
5652-19215-0028 WHICH HAD THE KINDNESS TO INDICATE THE HOUR BUT WHICH HAD NOT THE AIR OF BEING MADE FOR THAT AND WHICH
5652-19215-0029 EQUAL TO THAT FOR MY PART I AM OF THE OPINION OF THE BIG CLOCK OF STRASBURG AND I PREFER IT TO THE CUCKOO CLOCK FROM THE BLACK FOREST
5652-19215-0030 IT IGNORES THE NOBLE IN EVERYTHING IT IS CLEAN SHAVEN YOUR THIRD ESTATE IS INSIPID COLORLESS ODORLESS AND SHAPELESS THE DREAMS OF YOUR BOURGEOIS WHO SET UP AS THEY EXPRESS IT A PRETTY BOUDOIR
5652-19215-0031 FRESHLY DECORATED VIOLET EBONY AND CALICO MAKE WAY MAKE WAY THE SIEUR CURMUDGEON IS MARRYING MADEMOISELLE CLUTCH PENNY SUMPTUOUSNESS AND SPLENDOR
5652-19215-0032 I PREDICT THAT ALL WAS LOST
5652-19215-0033 I GRANT TO THIS AGE THE DEVICE DIRTY CLEANLINESS
5652-19215-0034 GIVE ME PERMISSION TO SPEAK I SAY NO EVIL OF THE PEOPLE AS YOU SEE I AM ALWAYS HARPING ON YOUR PEOPLE
5652-19215-0035 I BELONG TO IT HE WHO LOVES WELL LASHES WELL THEREUPON I SAY PLAINLY THAT NOW A DAYS
5652-19215-0036 AH IT IS TRUE I REGRET THE GRACE OF THE ANCIENT MANNERS I REGRET EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM THEIR ELEGANCE THEIR CHIVALRY
5652-19215-0037 THAT JOYOUS LUXURY WHICH EVERY ONE POSSESSED MUSIC FORMING PART OF THE WEDDING A SYMPHONY ABOVE STAIRS A BEATING OF DRUMS BELOW STAIRS THE DANCES THE JOYOUS FACES ROUND THE TABLE
5652-19215-0038 THE FINE SPUN GALLANT COMPLIMENTS THE SONGS THE FIREWORKS THE FRANK LAUGHTER THE DEVIL'S OWN ROW THE HUGE KNOTS OF RIBBON I REGRET THE BRIDE'S GARTER THE BRIDE'S GARTER IS COUSIN TO THE GIRDLE OF VENUS
5652-19215-0039 ON WHAT DOES THE WAR OF TROY TURN ON HELEN'S GARTER PARBLEU WHY DID THEY FIGHT WHY DID DIOMED
5652-19215-0040 THAT GREAT BRAZEN HELMET OF TEN POINTS WHY DID ACHILLES AND HECTOR HEW EACH OTHER UP WITH VAST BLOWS OF THEIR LANCES BECAUSE HELEN ALLOWED PARIS TO TAKE HER GARTER WITH COSETTE'S GARTER
5652-19215-0041 HOMER WOULD CONSTRUCT THE ILIAD HE WOULD PUT IN HIS POEM
5652-19215-0042 AND HE WOULD CALL HIM NESTOR MY FRIENDS IN BYGONE DAYS IN THOSE AMIABLE DAYS OF YORE PEOPLE MARRIED WISELY THEY HAD A GOOD CONTRACT AND THEN THEY HAD A GOOD CAROUSE
5652-19215-0043 GAMACHO ENTERED BUT IN SOOTH THE STOMACH IS AN AGREEABLE BEAST WHICH DEMANDS ITS DUE AND WHICH WANTS TO HAVE ITS WEDDING ALSO
5652-19215-0044 ONLY MODERATELY CONCEALED OH THE LARGE LAUGHING MOUTHS AND HOW GAY WE WERE IN THOSE DAYS YOUTH WAS A BOUQUET
5652-19215-0045 OR A TUFT OF ROSES WHETHER HE WAS A SHEPHERD OR A WARRIOR AND IF BY CHANCE ONE WAS A CAPTAIN OF DRAGOONS
5652-19215-0046 PEOPLE THOUGHT MUCH OF LOOKING WELL THEY EMBROIDERED AND TINTED THEMSELVES A BOURGEOIS HAD THE AIR OF A FLOWER A MARQUIS HAD THE AIR OF A PRECIOUS STONE PEOPLE HAD NO STRAPS TO THEIR BOOTS THEY HAD NO BOOTS
5652-19215-0047 THEY WERE SPRUCE SHINING WAVED LUSTROUS FLUTTERING DAINTY COQUETTISH WHICH DID NOT AT ALL PREVENT THEIR WEARING SWORDS BY THEIR SIDES THE HUMMING BIRD HAS BEAK AND CLAWS
5652-19215-0048 ONE OF THE SIDES OF THAT CENTURY WAS DELICATE THE OTHER WAS MAGNIFICENT AND BY THE GREEN CABBAGES PEOPLE AMUSED THEMSELVES TO DAY PEOPLE ARE SERIOUS THE BOURGEOIS IS AVARICIOUS THE BOURGEOISE IS A PRUDE
5652-19215-0049 YOUR CENTURY IS UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE WOULD DRIVE AWAY THE GRACES AS BEING TOO LOW IN THE NECK ALAS BEAUTY IS CONCEALED AS THOUGH IT WERE UGLINESS SINCE THE REVOLUTION
5652-19215-0050 EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE BALLET DANCERS HAS HAD ITS TROUSERS A MOUNTEBANK DANCER MUST BE GRAVE YOUR RIGADOONS ARE DOCTRINARIAN
5652-19215-0051 AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT ONE ARRIVES AT WITH THAT MAJESTY AT BEING PETTY LEARN THIS JOY IS NOT ONLY JOYOUS IT IS GREAT BUT BE IN LOVE GAYLY THEN
5652-19215-0052 WHAT THE DEUCE MARRY WHEN YOU MARRY WITH FEVER AND GIDDINESS AND TUMULT AND THE UPROAR OF HAPPINESS BE GRAVE IN CHURCH WELL AND GOOD BUT AS SOON AS THE MASS IS FINISHED
5652-19215-0053 YOU MUST MAKE A DREAM WHIRL AROUND THE BRIDE A MARRIAGE SHOULD BE ROYAL AND CHIMERICAL IT SHOULD PROMENADE ITS CEREMONY FROM THE CATHEDRAL OF RHEIMS TO THE PAGODA OF CHANTELOUP
5652-19215-0054 BE ONE OF THE GODS AH PEOPLE MIGHT BE SYLPHS GAMES AND LAUGHTER ARGIRASPIDES THEY ARE STUPIDS
5652-19215-0055 THE EMPYREAN WITH THE SWANS AND THE EAGLES EVEN IF YOU DO HAVE TO FALL BACK ON THE MORROW INTO THE BOURGEOISIE OF THE FROGS
5652-19215-0056 DO NOT PRUNE THEM OF THEIR SPLENDORS DON'T SCRIMP ON THE DAY WHEN YOU BEAM THE WEDDING IS NOT THE HOUSEKEEPING OH IF I WERE TO CARRY OUT MY FANCY IT WOULD BE GALLANT VIOLINS WOULD BE HEARD UNDER THE TREES
5652-19215-0057 RECEIVES NO IMPRESSIONS EITHER HUMAN OR PLEASANT OR PAINFUL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EARTHQUAKES AND CATASTROPHES THIS DEVOTION
5652-19215-0058 CORRESPONDS TO A COLD IN THE HEAD YOU SMELL NOTHING OF LIFE NEITHER ANY BAD NOR ANY GOOD ODOR MOREOVER THE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS HAD SETTLED THE ELDERLY SPINSTER'S INDECISION
5652-19215-0059 SOMEWHAT RESENTFUL IN HER INMOST SOUL
5652-19215-0060 SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT HIM POOR SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR MY NEPHEW HE IS WEDDING A BEGGAR LET HIM BE A BEGGAR HIMSELF BUT COSETTE'S HALF MILLION PLEASED THE AUNT AND ALTERED HER INWARD SITUATION SO FAR
5652-19215-0061 ONE OWES SOME CONSIDERATION TO SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SHE COULD NOT DO OTHERWISE THAN LEAVE HER FORTUNE TO THESE YOUNG PEOPLE SINCE THEY DID NOT NEED IT
5652-19215-0062 THE FINEST IN THE HOUSE THAT WILL MAKE ME YOUNG AGAIN HE SAID IT'S AN OLD PLAN OF MINE I HAVE ALWAYS ENTERTAINED THE IDEA OF HAVING A WEDDING IN MY CHAMBER
5652-39938-0000 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WORK OF THE PHYSICIAN DOES NOT BEGIN WITH HIS CURATIVE EFFORTS THERAPY IS ALWAYS ONLY THE LAST STEP DIAGNOSIS AND OBSERVATION HAVE TO PRECEDE AND AN INQUIRY INTO THE CAUSES OF THE DISEASE IS ESSENTIAL
5652-39938-0001 THE WHOLE EQUIPMENT OF THE MODERN LABORATORY OUGHT TO BE PUT AT ITS DISPOSAL PERCEPTIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS REACTIONS AND EXPRESSIONS OUGHT TO BE EXAMINED WITH THE SAME CAREFULNESS WITH WHICH THE CONSCIENTIOUS PHYSICIAN EXAMINES THE BLOOD AND THE URINE
5652-39938-0002 AND YET NO PSYCHICAL TREATMENT CAN START SUCCESSFULLY SO LONG AS THE PATIENT IS BROODING ON SECRET THOUGHTS AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS MIND THE DESIRE TO HIDE THEM MAY OFTEN BE ITSELF A PART OF THE DISEASE
5652-39938-0003 IT IS SURPRISING HOW OFTEN UNSUSPECTED VISTAS OF THOUGHTS AND IMPULSES AND EMOTIONS ARE OPENED BY AN INQUIRING ANALYSIS WHERE THE DIRECT REPORT OF THE PATIENT DOES NOT AWAKEN THE LEAST SUSPICION
5652-39938-0004 THE INTELLECTUAL CLEARNESS OF THE PATIENT TOO EASILY TEMPTS ONE INTO TRUSTING THE SINCERITY OF HIS STORY AND YET THE MOST IMPORTANT IDEAS CLUSTERING PERHAPS ABOUT LOVE OR AMBITION ABOUT VICE OR CRIME ABOUT BUSINESS FAILURE OR FAMILY SECRETS
5652-39938-0005 WITHHELD AND MAY FRUSTRATE EVERY PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC INFLUENCE WHERE SUSPICION IS AWAKE AND MERE CONFIDENTIAL TALK AND PERSUASION SEEM INSUFFICIENT
5652-39938-0006 THE PHYSICIAN MAY FEEL JUSTIFIED IN THE INTEREST OF HIS PATIENT IN DRAWING THE THOUGHTS OUT OF THEIR HIDING PLACE BY ARTIFICIAL MEANS SKILL TACT AND EXPERIENCE ARE NEEDED THERE AS A MATTER OF COURSE
5652-39938-0007 WILL SUPPORT THE PHYSICIAN AND ACCORDINGLY HIS EXAMINATION IS NOT OBLIGED TO TRAP THE PATIENT BUT SIMPLY TO GUIDE HIM TO IMPORTANT POINTS BUT THEN BEGINS THE MOST ESSENTIAL STUDY OF DIAGNOSTICAL DIFFERENTIATION
5652-39938-0008 WITH ALL THE MEANS NOT ONLY OF PSYCHOLOGY BUT OF NEUROLOGY AND INTERNAL MEDICINE HE HAS TO SEPARATE THE PARTICULAR CASE FROM SIMILAR ONES AND TO EXAMINE WHETHER HE DEALS WITH FOR INSTANCE A HYSTERIC OR WITH A PARANOIAC
5652-39938-0009 AND HE WILL NOT FORGET THAT THERE EXIST ALMOST NO SYMPTOMS OF SERIOUS DISEASES WHICH THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE HYSTERIC MAY NOT IMITATE FOR A TIME
5652-39938-0010 NOT OURS IS THE TASK OF ANALYZING SPECIAL METHODS OF NEUROLOGICAL AND MENTAL DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS SUCH AS ARE USED IN THE PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC AND IN THE OFFICE OF THE NERVE SPECIALIST THERE THE FAMILY HISTORY WITH REFERENCE TO NERVOUS AND OTHER DISEASES
5652-39938-0011 IN A SIMILAR WAY THE PSYCHICAL EXAMINATION TESTS THE HALLUCINATIONS AND ILLUSIONS THE VARIATIONS AND DEFECTS OF MEMORY AND ATTENTION OF JUDGMENT AND REASONING OF ORIENTATION AND SELF CONSCIOUSNESS OF EMOTIONS AND VOLITIONS
5652-39938-0012 BUT ONE RULE IS COMMON TO ALL OF THEM NEVER USE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC METHODS IN A SCHEMATIC WAY LIKE A RIGID PATTERN SCHEMATIC TREATMENT IS A POOR TREATMENT IN EVERY DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE BUT IN PSYCHOTHERAPEUTICS IT IS DISASTROUS
5652-39938-0013 THERE ARE NO TWO CASES ALIKE AND NOT ONLY THE EASILY RECOGNIZABLE DIFFERENCES OF SEX AND AGE AND OCCUPATION AND EDUCATION AND FINANCIAL MEANS AND TEMPERAMENT AND CAPACITY ARE DECISIVE
5652-39938-0014 BUT ALL THE SUBTLE VARIATIONS OF PREJUDICES AND BELIEFS PREFERENCES AND DISLIKES FAMILY LIFE AND SOCIAL SURROUNDINGS AMBITIONS AND PROSPECTS MEMORIES AND FANCIES
5652-39938-0015 EVERY ELEMENT OF A MAN'S LIFE HISTORY IMPRESSIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD HIS LOVE AND HIS SUCCESSES HIS DISEASES AND HIS DISTRESSES HIS ACQUAINTANCES AND HIS READING HIS TALENT HIS CHARACTER HIS SINCERITY HIS ENERGY HIS INTELLIGENCE
5652-39938-0016 EVERYTHING OUGHT TO DETERMINE THE CHOICE OF THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC STEPS AS IT IS ENTIRELY IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE ALL THOSE FACTORS BY ANY SUFFICIENT INQUIRY
5652-39938-0017 MOST OF THE ADJUSTMENT OF METHOD MUST BE LEFT TO THE INSTINCT OF THE PHYSICIAN IN WHICH WIDE EXPERIENCE SOLID KNOWLEDGE TACT AND SYMPATHY OUGHT TO BE BLENDED EVEN THE WAY IN WHICH THE PATIENT REACTS ON THE METHOD WILL OFTEN GUIDE THE INSTINCT OF THE WELL TRAINED PSYCHOTHERAPIST
5652-39938-0018 IT IS THEREFORE CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH THAT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PHYSICIAN SIMPLY DECIDE BEFOREHAND ON A DEFINITE COURSE OF PSYCHICAL TREATMENT AND LEAVE THE CARRYING OUT TO A WELL MEANING MINISTER OR ANY OTHER MEDICAL AMATEUR WHO SCHEMATICALLY FOLLOWS THE INDICATED PATH
5652-39938-0019 THE FINEST ADJUSTMENT HAS TO COME IN DURING THE TREATMENT ITSELF AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT OFTEN HAS TO SUGGEST ENTIRELY NEW LINES OF PROCEDURE
5652-39938-0020 MORE THAN IN ANY OTHER FIELD OF MEDICINE THE PHYSICIAN HIMSELF HAS TO EXTEND HIS INFLUENCE FAR BEYOND THE OFFICE HOURS AND THE STRICTLY MEDICAL RELATIONS AND YET ON THE OTHER HAND THERE IS NO DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE IN WHICH THE TREATMENT MIGHT NOT PROFIT BY THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC INFLUENCE
5652-39938-0021 SUBTLE ADJUSTMENT TO THE PERSONAL NEEDS AND TO THE INDIVIDUAL CONDITIONS IS NECESSARY IN EVERY CASE WHERE THE PSYCHICAL FACTOR IS TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE
5652-39938-0022 IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT THE ONE GREAT OBSTACLE IN THE WORK OF THE ROUTINE PHYSICIAN IS THE LACK OF TIME AND PATIENCE WHICH IS NEEDED FOR SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT TO PRESCRIBE DRUGS IS ALWAYS QUICKER THAN TO INFLUENCE THE MIND
5652-39938-0023 THE FIRST METHOD TO BRING BACK THE PSYCHOPHYSICAL EQUILIBRIUM
5652-39938-0024 NAMELY TO REMOVE THE EXTERNAL SOURCES OF THE DISTURBANCE EXTERNAL INDICATES THERE NOT ONLY THE OUTER WORLD BUT ALSO THE OWN BODY OUTSIDE THE CONSCIOUS PARTS OF THE BRAIN
5652-39938-0025 IF WE TAKE IT IN THE WIDEST MEANING THIS WOULD EVIDENTLY INCLUDE EVERY POSSIBLE MEDICAL TASK FROM FILLING A PAINFUL TOOTH TO OPERATING ON A PAINFUL APPENDIX AS IN EVERY CASE WHERE PAIN RESULTS THE MENTAL EQUILIBRIUM IS DISTURBED BY IT AND THE NORMAL MENTAL LIFE OF THE PATIENT REDUCED IN ITS EFFICIENCY
5652-39938-0026 GROWTHS IN THE NOSE MAY BE OPERATED UPON THE ASTIGMATIC OR THE SHORT SIGHTED EYE MAY BE CORRECTED BY GLASSES THE CHILD WHO IS HARD OF HEARING MAY AT LEAST BE SEATED NEAR THE TEACHER AND THE BACKWARD CHILDREN QUICKLY REACH THE AVERAGE LEVEL
5652-39938-0027 NO DOUBT IN THE LIFE OF THE ADULT AS WELL OFTEN ALMOST INSIGNIFICANT AND FROM A STRICTLY PHYSICAL POINT OF VIEW UNIMPORTANT ABNORMITIES IN THE BODILY SYSTEM
5652-39938-0028 ESPECIALLY IN THE DIGESTIVE AND SEXUAL SPHERES ARE SOURCES OF IRRITATION WHICH SLOWLY INFLUENCE THE WHOLE PERSONALITY
5652-39938-0029 TO BE SURE THE BRAIN DISTURBANCE MAY HAVE REACHED A POINT WHERE THE MERE REMOVAL OF THE ORIGINAL AFFLICTION IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO REINSTATE THE NORMAL BALANCE OF MENTAL ENERGIES BUT WHEREVER SUCH A BODILY IRRITATION GOES ON IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO ABOLISH IT IN THE INTERESTS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY
5652-39938-0030 HOWEVER OFTEN HE MAY GET THE IMPRESSION THAT SUCH A LIBERATION WOULD STOP THE SOURCE OF THE MENTAL TROUBLE
5652-39938-0031 OFTEN WITHIN A SURPRISINGLY SHORT TIME THE BRAIN GATHERS THE ENERGIES TO OVERCOME THE FRICTIONS WITH UNAVOIDABLE SURROUNDINGS YET HERE THE PHYSICIAN HAS TO ADJUST THE PRESCRIBED DOSE OF OUTING VERY CAREFULLY TO THE SPECIAL CASE
5652-39938-0032 WE MAY BE GUIDED BY THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE INTEREST OF TESTING THE FATIGUE INDUCED BY MENTAL WORK
5652-39938-0033 IF PERHAPS FOUR HOURS OF CONCENTRATED WORK ARE DONE WITHOUT PAUSES EXPERIMENT SHOWS THAT THE QUALITY OF THE WORK DETERIORATES MEASURED FOR INSTANCE BY THE NUMBER OF MISTAKES IN QUICK CALCULATION
5652-39938-0034 THE INSTINCT OF THE PHYSICIAN HAS TO FIND THE MIDDLE WAY BETWEEN A TEMPORARY REMOVAL OF IRRITATION WHICH REALLY ALLOWS A DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ENERGIES AND A MERE INTERRUPTION WHICH SIMPLY DAMAGES THE ACQUIRED RELATIVE ADJUSTMENT
5652-39938-0035 EVERY CAUSE OF FRICTION WHICH CAN BE PERMANENTLY ANNIHILATED FOR THE PATIENT CERTAINLY SHOULD BE REMOVED THIS NEGATIVE REMEDY DEMANDS ITS POSITIVE SUPPLEMENT
5652-39938-0036 THE PATIENT MUST BE BROUGHT UNDER CONDITIONS AND INFLUENCES WHICH GIVE FAIR CHANCES FOR THE RECUPERATION OF HIS ENERGIES TOO OFTEN FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE PSYCHOLOGIST THE PRESCRIPTION IS SIMPLY REST
5652-39938-0037 AS FAR AS REST INVOLVES SLEEP IT IS CERTAINLY THE IDEAL PRESCRIPTION THERE IS NO OTHER INFLUENCE WHICH BUILDS UP THE INJURED CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM AS SAFELY AS SOUND NATURAL SLEEP
5652-39938-0038 AND LOSS OF SLEEP IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST PERNICIOUS CONDITIONS FOR THE BRAIN AGAIN REST IS A GREAT FACTOR IN THOSE SYSTEMATIC REST CURES WHICH FOR A LONG WHILE WERE ALMOST THE FASHION WITH THE NEUROLOGIST
5652-39938-0039 IT IS SIMPLY MEANT THAT HE GIVE UP HIS FATIGUING DAILY WORK EVEN IF THAT WORK IS MADE UP OF A ROUND OF ENTERTAINMENTS AND CALLS AND SOCIAL ENGAGEMENTS THE NEURASTHENIC AND ALL SIMILAR VARIETIES ARE SENT AWAY FROM THE NOISE OF THE CITY AWAY FROM THE RUSH OF THEIR BUSY LIFE
5652-39938-0040 THE WILD CHASE FOR LUXURY IN THE HIGHER CLASSES REENFORCED BY THE COMMERCIALISM OF OUR TIME THE HARD AND MONOTONOUS LABOR IN OUR MODERN MILLS AND MINES FOR THE LOWER CLASSES
5652-39938-0041 THE OVER EXCITEMENT BROUGHT TO EVERYBODY BY THE SENSATIONALISM OF OUR NEWSPAPERS AND OF OUR PUBLIC LIFE ALL INJURE THE BRAIN CELLS AND DAMAGE THE EQUILIBRIUM
5652-39938-0042 THAT IS A STORY WHICH WE HEAR A THOUSAND TIMES NOWADAYS YET IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THERE IS REALLY MUCH TRUTH IN SUCH A CLAIM AND WHETHER MUCH WISE PSYCHOTHERAPY CAN BE DEDUCED FROM IT
5652-39938-0043 WE MAY BEGIN EVEN WITH THE VERY JUSTIFIABLE DOUBT WHETHER NERVOUSNESS REALLY HAS INCREASED IN OUR TIME EARLIER PERIODS HAD NOT SO MANY NAMES FOR THOSE SYMPTOMS AND WERE NOT ABLE TO DISCRIMINATE THEM WITH THE SAME CLEARNESS
5652-39938-0044 EVEN TODAY MOST PEOPLE ARE STILL WITHOUT SUSPICION THAT A NEURASTHENIC OR A PSYCHASTHENIC OR A HYSTERIC DISTURBANCE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM MAY BE IN ITS BEGINNING
5652-39938-0045 EARLIER TIMES SURELY MAY HAVE TREATED EVEN THE STRONGER VARIETIES OF THIS KIND AS TROUBLESOME VARIATIONS IN THE SPHERE OF THE NORMAL
5652-39938-0046 THE PROGRESS OF SCIENTIFIC HYGIENE HAS BROUGHT EVERYONE MUCH NEARER TO A HARMONIOUS FUNCTIONING OF THE ORGANISM AND THE PROGRESS OF TECHNIQUE HAS REMOVED INNUMERABLE DIFFICULTIES FROM THE PLAY OF LIFE
5652-39938-0047 OF COURSE WE STAND TODAY BEFORE A MUCH MORE COMPLEX SURROUNDING THAN OUR ANCESTORS BUT STILL MORE QUICKLY THAN THE COMPLEXITY HAVE GROWN THE MEANS TO MASTER IT
5652-39938-0048 THERE IS NO NATION ON EARTH WHICH IS MORE PROUD OF ITS RUSH AND ITS HURRY THAN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND YET WHAT AN
5652-39938-0049 MOREOVER OUR LIFE HAS PROBABLY BECOME COOLER THERE IS LESS EMOTIONALISM LESS SENTIMENTALITY MORE BUSINESS LIKE ATTITUDE AND THAT ALL MEANS LESS INNER FRICTION AND EXCITEMENT IN PUBLIC LIFE TOO LESS FEAR OF WAR AND LESS RELIGIOUS STRUGGLE
5652-39938-0050 ABOVE ALL THE INTENSITY OF MENTAL STIMULI IS ALWAYS RELATIVE THE PSYCHOLOGIST KNOWS THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH DETERMINE THAT WE PERCEIVE THE DIFFERENCE OF IMPRESSIONS AS ALIKE WHEN THE STIMULI ARE PROPORTIONAL
5652-39938-0051 IF I HAVE A TEN POUND WEIGHT IN ONE HAND I MAY FIND THAT I MUST HAVE ONE POUND MORE IN THE OTHER HAND TO DISCRIMINATE THE DIFFERENCE
5652-39938-0052 YET THAT QUIET COUNTRYMAN MAY REACT IN HIS NARROW SYSTEM NOT LESS WHEN THE MODEST CHANGES IN HIS SURROUNDINGS PROVOKE HIM THE GOSSIP OF HIS NEIGHBOR MAY UNDERMINE HIS NERVOUS SYSTEM JUST AS MUCH AS A POLITICAL FIGHT OR THE STRUGGLES OF THE EXCHANGE THAT OF THE CITY MAN
5652-39938-0053 EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE ESTIMATED WITH REFERENCE TO THE STANDARD OF THE PARTICULAR CASE THIS RELATIVITY OF THE MENTAL REACTION ON THE DEMANDS OF LIFE MUST ALWAYS BE IN THE FOREGROUND OF THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC REGIME
5652-39938-0054 SIMPLY TO WITHDRAW A PATIENT FROM THE ONE KIND OF LIFE
5652-39938-0055 COMPLETE REST FOR INSTANCE FOR A HARD BRAIN WORKER HARDLY OUGHT TO BE RECOMMENDED UNLESS A HIGH DEGREE OF EXHAUSTION HAS COME ON IF ROUTINE PRESCRIPTIONS ARE TO BE ADMITTED AT ALL
5652-39938-0056 THEY SHOULD NOT BE COMPLETE REST OR COMPLETE CHANGE OF LIFE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME BUT A CONTINUATION OF THE LIFE FOR WHICH ADJUSTMENT HAS BEEN LEARNED WITH A REASONABLE REDUCTION OF THE DEMANDS AND STIMULATIONS
5652-39938-0057 THE INTELLECTUAL WORKER OUGHT TO DECREASE HIS WORK THE OVERBUSY SOCIETY WOMAN OUGHT TO STAY IN BED ONE DAY IN THE WEEK THE MAN IN THE MIDST OF THE RUSH OF LIFE OUGHT TO CUT DOWN HIS OBLIGATIONS
5652-39938-0058 BUT PROBABLY EACH OF THEM DOES BETTER TO GO ON THAN SIMPLY TO SWEAR OFF ALTOGETHER THEIR REST OUGHT TO HAVE THE CHARACTER OF VACATION THAT MEANS INTERRUPTIONS WITHOUT THE USUAL ACTIVITY OUGHT TO BE SHORT PERIODS SPENT WITH THE DISTINCT FEELING
5652-39938-0059 THAT THEY ARE INTERRUPTIONS OF THAT WHICH MUST LAST AND THAT THEY ARE NOT THEMSELVES TO BECOME LASTING STATES
5652-39938-0060 STRENUOSITY MUST NOT MEAN AN EXTERNAL RUSH WITH THE GESTURES OF OVERBUSY EXCITEMENT BUT CERTAINLY THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAZY LIFE IS WRETCHED PSYCHOTHERAPY AS LONG AS NO SERIOUS ILLNESS IS IN QUESTION
5652-39938-0061 BY FAR THE BEST ALTERATION IS THEREFORE EVEN IN THE PERIODS OF INTERRUPTION NOT SIMPLY REST BUT NEW ENGAGEMENTS WHICH AWAKEN NEW INTERESTS AND STIMULATE NEGLECTED MENTAL FACTORS DISBURDENING THE OVER STRAINED ELEMENTS OF MENTAL LIFE
5652-39938-0062 THE MOST EFFECTIVE AGENCY FOR THIS TASK IS CONTACT WITH BEAUTY BEAUTY IN NATURE AND LIFE BEAUTY IN ART AND LITERATURE AND MUSIC
5652-39938-0063 TO ENJOY A LANDSCAPE OUGHT TO BE NOT MERELY A NEGATIVE REST FOR THE MAN OF THE OFFICE BUILDING AND GOOD LITERATURE OR MUSIC ABSORBS THE MENTAL ENERGIES AND HARMONIZES THEM
5652-39938-0064 IN THE SECOND PLACE COME GAMES AND SPORT WHICH MAY ENTER INTO THEIR RIGHT IF FATIGUE CAN BE AVOIDED HARMONIOUS JOYFUL COMPANY AS DIFFERENT AS POSSIBLE FROM THE DEPRESSING COMPANY OF THE SANITARIUMS WILL ADD ITS PLEASANTNESS
5652-39938-0065 WHILE THE ADVICE OF THE PHYSICIAN OUGHT THUS TO EMPHASIZE THE POSITIVE ELEMENTS WHICH WORK NOT TOWARDS REST BUT TOWARD A HARMONIOUS MENTAL ACTIVITY WE MUST NOT FORGET SOME ESSENTIAL NEGATIVE PRESCRIPTIONS
5652-39938-0066 EVERYTHING IS TO BE AVOIDED WHICH INTERFERES WITH THE NIGHT'S SLEEP
5688-15787-0000 THERE WERE THREE GOOD HOTELS SEVERAL STORES DRAPERS WATCHMAKER TAILORS SHOEMAKERS AND BUTCHERS AND BAKERS LOTS OF DIGGERS WERE RETURNING WHO HAD MADE THEIR PILE AND OTHERS GOING TO TRY TO MAKE THEIRS OF COURSE WE WERE AMONGST THE LATTER
5688-15787-0001 AFTER SUNDRY REFRESHMENTS WE WENT INTO COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER WHAT WAS TO BE DONE NEXT WE ALL AGREED THAT A DAY'S SPELL WOULD DO US A DEAL OF GOOD AND THAT WE SHOULD BE ALL THE BETTER PREPARED FOR GOLD DIGGING AFTERWARDS
5688-15787-0002 WE WERE THEN ONLY TWELVE OR FOURTEEN MILES FROM FOREST CREEK AND I PROPOSED LOOKING FOR FRESH LODGINGS AS THE HOUSE WE WERE STAYING AT WAS ANYTHING BUT RESPECTABLE THIS WAS AGREED TO AND WE SEARCHED AND WERE SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING GOOD BEDS
5688-15787-0003 FOOD AND LIQUORS AND PLENTY OF COMPANY THIS WILL DO SAID I WE MUST MAKE SOME MONEY HERE HOW SAID FIDDLER JIM THE SAME AS AT THE FOREST INN REPLIED I AT ANY RATE WE CAN BUT TRY SAID PLUMBER GEORGE
5688-15787-0004 I AM GOOD TO KEEP THE DOOR AND REPAIR THEIR BEER ENGINE IF THROUGH BEING OVERWORKED IT SHOULD HAPPEN TO GET OUT OF ORDER WELL I'LL SEE WHAT'S BEST TO BE DONE SAID I IN THE MEANTIME YOU HAVE A REST TILL I COME BACK

5688-15787-0006 MY MATE PLAYS AND I AM A LONDON CONCERT SINGER WILL YOU GIVE US AN ENGAGEMENT SAID I NO SAID SHE I WILL NOT DO THAT BUT YOU CAN HAVE THE USE OF OUR CLUB ROOM FOR NOTHING AND YOU CAN CHARGE WHAT YOU LIKE FOR ADMISSION
5688-15787-0007 I TOLD HER THAT AT THE FOREST INN THE LANDLORD FOUND US IN BOARD AND LODGING VERY WELL THEN SAID SHE I WILL DO THE SAME WHEN DO YOU PROPOSE TO COMMENCE TO NIGHT SAID I THEN SAID SHE I'LL TELL THE OSTLER TO LIGHT UP THE ROOM AND GET YOUR STAGE READY
5688-15787-0008 I HAD A NOBBLER AND RETURNED TO MY MATES AND FOUND THEM ASLEEP WAKE UP SAID I THERE'S BUSINESS TO BE DONE WHAT'S UP SAID FIDDLER JIM ANYTHING FRESH ASKED PLUMBER GEORGE YES SAID I TELLING THEM ALL ABOUT MY ARRANGEMENTS
5688-15787-0009 WHAT'S TO BE DONE FIRST SAID I WE MUST GET A LARGE PIECE OF CARDBOARD AND WRITE ON IT IN LARGE LETTERS A GRAND BALL AND CONCERT WILL TAKE PLACE HERE TO NIGHT ADMISSION
5688-15787-0010 THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY WAS SPENT GOING ABOUT INFORMING THE INHABITANTS WHAT A TREAT WAS IN STORE FOR THEM YOU MUST KNOW THAT FIDDLER JIM AND MYSELF HAD BROUGHT WITH US AN OLD DRESS COAT EACH AND BLACK TROUSERS AND WHITE WAISTCOAT ALL THE WORSE FOR WEAR
5688-15787-0011 THESE AND MY COATS AND OTHER RAGS FOR CARICATURE BUSINESS AND THE FIDDLE COMPRISED OUR PROFESSIONAL STOCK IN TRADE
5688-15787-0012 PLUMBER GEORGE WAS AT THE DOOR TAKING THE TWO SHILLINGS WHICH I THOUGHT WAS LITTLE LESS THAN A ROBBERY BUT I HAD AGREED TO DO IT THEY COMMENCED THE SAME PROGRAMME AS AT THE FOREST INN AND ALL WENT OFF WELL THE INTERVAL AS BEFORE AND DRINKS ALL ROUND
5688-15787-0013 EVERYBODY WAS EAGER FOR THE DANCE OFF THEY WENT MISSUS HALLIDAY CAME IN SHE WAS A SCOTCH LASSIE AND COULDN'T KEEP HER FEET QUIET WHILE THE REEL OF TULLEGORAM WAS BEING PLAYED SHE RUSHED INTO THE ROOM AND BEGAN TO TWIST AND TWIRL ABOUT LIKE AN EEL TILL SHE NEARLY FAINTED
5688-15787-0014 WE THANKED THE COMPANY AND RETIRED TO OUR ROOM COUNTED THE CASH AND FOUND WE HAD TAKEN EIGHT POUNDS IT'S NOT BAD SAID FIDDLER JIM LET'S HAVE ANOTHER NOBBLER BEFORE WE GO TO BED SAID PLUMBER GEORGE ALL RIGHT REJOINED I
5688-15787-0015 HOME TO DINNER EVERYTHING GOING RIGHT RESTED IN THE AFTERNOON
5688-15787-0016 THE PLACE WAS NOT RUSHED THE SECOND NIGHT BUT WE NEVERTHELESS ADDED FOUR POUNDS MORE TO OUR TREASURY AFTER A GOOD NIGHT'S REST WE GOT UP AND PREPARED TO START
5688-15787-0017 WE HAD ABOUT TWELVE OR FOURTEEN MILES TO WALK TO THE GREAT FOREST DIGGINGS THAT HAD GIVEN ME THE FEVER IN LONDON WE STOPPED AT SAWPIT GULLY AND HAD A REST AND BEER SIX MILES MORE AND THEN WE SAW WHAT IS NOT EASILY FORGOTTEN
5688-15787-0018 WE ARRIVED SAFELY AT THE CREEK AND WERE ASTONISHED TO SEE THE NUMBER OF TENTS THE THOUSANDS AT WORK MEN WOMEN GIRLS AND BOYS OF ALL AGES AND THE DEEP HOLES NEARLY FRIGHTENED ME
5688-15787-0019 JOE JOE WHICH WAS RESPONDED TO ALL ROUND THE DIGGINGS IT WAS A SAYING OR CRY THEY HAD WHEN THE POLICE WENT ROUND TO EXAMINE THEIR LICENCES I AND MY PARTY WALKED ON TAKING OBSERVATIONS WHEN ALL AT ONCE SOME ONE CALLED OUT IS THAT YOU PLUMBER GEORGE

5688-15787-0038 WE ARRANGED THAT PLUMBER GEORGE WAS TO BE COOK FOR THE FIRST WEEK AND THE FIRST THING THAT HE HAD TO DO WAS TO CHOP A TREE DOWN BUT FIDDLER JIM HOWEVER HAD TO HELP HIM I WENT OFF TO THE BUTCHER'S SHOP AND GOT CREDIT FOR A QUARTER OF MUTTON
5688-15787-0039 AND WHEN I GOT BACK THEY HAD LIGHTED A FIRE SO I FRIED SOME MUTTON BOILED SOME POTATOES AND HAD DINNER AFTER WHICH WE WENT INTO COMMITTEE WHAT'S THE FIRST THING TO BE DONE ASKED GEORGE WE MUST TAKE OUT OUR LICENCE BEFORE WE BEGIN TO DIG SAID JIM

5688-15787-0041 I'LL TRY MY FRIEND MISTER POSTMAN SAID GEORGE HE DID SO AND GOT IT WE THEN TOOK A WALK TO THE COMMISSIONER'S TENT AND GOT OUR LICENCES AFTER WHICH WE HAD A GOOD LOOK OVER THE TOWNSHIP WHICH WAS CALLED CASTLEMAINE AND IS SO CALLED TO THIS DAY
5688-15787-0042 ITS ORIGINAL NAME HOWEVER WAS MOUNT ALEXANDER
5688-15787-0043 AS IT RAINED HEAVILY WE AGREED NOT TO START WORK UNTIL THE NEXT DAY SO WE RETURNED TO OUR TENT AND WROTE LETTERS INFORMING THE FOLKS AT HOME OF OUR SAFE ARRIVAL GOT TO WORK NEXT DAY AND TOOK IT IN TURNS ONE TO USE THE PICK AND THE OTHER THE SHOVEL
5688-15787-0044 WE GOT DOWN ABOUT FOUR FEET THE FIRST DAY AND WERE VERY TIRED OUR HANDS NOT BEING USED TO PICK AND SHOVEL WORK WERE VERY SORE THE NEXT DAY WE EXPECTED TO BOTTOM THE HOLE THE DIGGERS TOLD US THAT WE SHOULD STRIKE THE PIPE CLAY AT ABOUT SEVEN FEET
5688-15787-0045 THE DEEPER WE WENT THE LABOR OF GETTING THE STUFF TO THE SURFACE WAS INCREASED AS EVERY BIT HAD TO BE DRAWN UP IN BUCKETS THE THIRD DAY WE GOT TO THE PIPE CLAY UNDER WHICH WAS FOUND A SMALL DEPOSIT OF GRAVEL
5688-41232-0000 APPENDIX A THE INFLUENCE OF MENSTRUATION ON THE POSITION OF WOMEN A QUESTION OF HISTORICAL PSYCHOLOGY
5688-41232-0001 IN REGARD TO WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SPEAK WITH CERTAINTY BUT WE HERE STRIKE ON A FACTOR OF SUCH IMPORTANCE SUCH NEGLECTED IMPORTANCE FOR THE PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SEXUAL RELATIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN THAT IT CANNOT BE WHOLLY IGNORED
5688-41232-0002 AMONG THE NEGROES OF SURINAM A WOMAN MUST LIVE IN SOLITUDE DURING THE TIME OF HER PERIOD IT IS DANGEROUS FOR ANY MAN OR WOMAN TO APPROACH HER AND WHEN SHE SEES A PERSON COMING NEAR SHE CRIES OUT ANXIOUSLY
5688-41232-0003 I AM UNCLEAN I AM UNCLEAN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WE FIND TRACES OF THE CUSTOM OF WHICH THIS IS A TYPICAL EXAMPLE BUT WE MUST NOT TOO HASTILY ASSUME THAT THIS CUSTOM IS EVIDENCE OF THE INFERIOR POSITION OCCUPIED BY SEMI CIVILIZED WOMEN
5688-41232-0004 IT IS NECESSARY TO TAKE A BROAD VIEW NOT ONLY OF THE BELIEFS OF SEMI CIVILIZED MAN REGARDING MENSTRUATION
5688-41232-0005 HAVE BEEN CREDITED WITH SOME DESIGN SINISTER OR EROTIC ON WOMEN
5688-41232-0006 ALL THESE FIGURES ARE REPRODUCED BY PLOSS AND BARTELS EVEN IN MODERN EUROPE THE SAME IDEAS PREVAIL IN PORTUGAL ACCORDING TO REYS IT IS BELIEVED THAT DURING MENSTRUATION WOMEN ARE LIABLE TO BE BITTEN BY LIZARDS
5688-41232-0007 AND TO GUARD AGAINST THIS RISK THEY WEAR DRAWERS DURING THE PERIOD IN GERMANY AGAIN IT WAS BELIEVED UP TO THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AT LEAST
5688-41232-0008 TO BUILD UP THIS WORLD WIDE BELIEF REGARDING THE ORIGIN OF MENSTRUATION THIS PRIMITIVE THEORY OF THE ORIGIN OF MENSTRUATION PROBABLY BRINGS BEFORE US IN ITS EARLIEST SHAPE THE SPECIAL AND INTIMATE BOND WHICH HAS EVER BEEN HELD TO CONNECT WOMEN
5688-41232-0009 BY VIRTUE OF THE MENSTRUAL PROCESS WITH THE NATURAL OR SUPERNATURAL POWERS OF THE WORLD EVERYWHERE MENSTRUATING WOMEN ARE SUPPOSED TO BE POSSESSED BY SPIRITS AND CHARGED WITH MYSTERIOUS FORCES IT IS AT THIS POINT THAT A SERIOUS MISCONCEPTION
5688-41232-0010 AS A MATTER OF FACT HOWEVER THE SAVAGE RARELY DISCRIMINATES BETWEEN BAD AND GOOD SPIRITS EVERY SPIRIT MAY HAVE EITHER A BENEFICIAL OR MALIGNANT INFLUENCE
5688-41232-0011 THE IMPORTANCE OF RECOGNIZING THE SPECIAL SENSE IN WHICH THE WORD UNCLEAN IS USED IN THIS CONNECTION WAS CLEARLY POINTED OUT BY ROBERTSON SMITH IN THE CASE OF THE SEMITES
5688-41232-0012 IS NOT THE ORDINARY WORD FOR THINGS PHYSICALLY FOUL IT IS A RITUAL TERM AND CORRESPONDS EXACTLY TO THE IDEA OF TABOO THE IDEAS UNCLEAN AND HOLY SEEM TO US TO STAND IN POLAR OPPOSITION TO ONE ANOTHER
5688-41232-0013 BUT IT WAS NOT SO WITH THE SEMITES AMONG THE LATER JEWS THE HOLY BOOKS DEFILED THE HANDS OF THE READER AS CONTACT WITH AN IMPURE THING DID AMONG LUCIAN'S SYRIANS
5688-41232-0014 WELLHAUSEN HOWEVER DEALING WITH THE EARLY ARABIANS EXPRESSLY MENTIONS THAT IN PRE ISLAMIC DAYS CLEAN AND UNCLEAN WERE USED SOLELY WITH REFERENCE TO WOMEN IN AND OUT OF THE MENSTRUAL STATE
5688-41232-0015 AT A LATER DATE FRAZER DEVELOPED THIS ASPECT OF THE CONCEPTION OF TABOO AND SHOWED HOW IT OCCURS AMONG SAVAGE RACES GENERALLY HE POINTED OUT THAT THE CONCEPTIONS OF HOLINESS AND POLLUTION NOT HAVING YET BEEN DIFFERENTIATED
5688-41232-0016 WOMEN AT CHILDBIRTH AND DURING MENSTRUATION ARE ON THE SAME LEVEL AS DIVINE KINGS CHIEFS AND PRIESTS AND MUST OBSERVE THE SAME RULES OF CEREMONIAL PURITY TO SECLUDE SUCH PERSONS FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD SO THAT THE DREADED SPIRITUAL DANGER SHALL NOT SPREAD
5688-41232-0017 IS THE OBJECT OF THE TABOO WHICH FRAZER COMPARES TO AN ELECTRICAL INSULATOR TO PRESERVE THE SPIRITUAL FORCE WITH WHICH THESE PERSONS ARE CHARGED FROM SUFFERING OR INFLICTING HARM BY CONTACT WITH THE OUTER WORLD
5688-41232-0018 AFTER DESCRIBING THE PHENOMENA ESPECIALLY THE PROHIBITION TO TOUCH THE GROUND OR SEE THE SUN FOUND AMONG VARIOUS RACES FRAZER CONCLUDES
5688-41232-0019 THE OBJECT OF SECLUDING WOMEN AT MENSTRUATION IS TO NEUTRALIZE THE DANGEROUS INFLUENCES WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO EMANATE FROM THEM AT SUCH TIMES THE GENERAL EFFECT OF THESE RULES IS TO KEEP THE GIRL SUSPENDED SO TO SAY BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH
5688-41232-0020 WHETHER ENVELOPED IN HER HAMMOCK AND SLUNG UP TO THE ROOF AS IN SOUTH AMERICA OR ELEVATED ABOVE THE GROUND IN A DARK AND NARROW CAGE AS IN NEW ZEALAND SHE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE OUT OF THE WAY OF DOING MISCHIEF SINCE BEING SHUT OFF BOTH FROM THE EARTH AND FROM THE SUN
5688-41232-0021 THE PRECAUTIONS THUS TAKEN TO ISOLATE OR INSULATE THE GIRL ARE DICTATED BY REGARD FOR HER OWN SAFETY AS WELL AS FOR THE SAFETY OF OTHERS IN SHORT THE GIRL IS VIEWED AS CHARGED WITH A POWERFUL FORCE WHICH IF NOT KEPT WITHIN BOUNDS
5688-41232-0022 MAY PROVE THE DESTRUCTION BOTH OF THE GIRL HERSELF AND OF ALL WITH WHOM SHE COMES IN CONTACT TO REPRESS THIS FORCE WITHIN THE LIMITS NECESSARY FOR THE SAFETY OF ALL CONCERNED IS THE OBJECT OF THE TABOOS IN QUESTION
5688-41232-0023 THE SAME EXPLANATION APPLIES TO THE OBSERVANCE OF THE SAME RULES BY DIVINE KINGS AND PRIESTS
5688-41232-0024 AND ARGUING THAT IT PROCEEDS FROM THE CUSTOM OF EXOGAMY OR MARRIAGE OUTSIDE THE CLAN AND THAT THIS RESTS ON CERTAIN IDEAS ABOUT BLOOD WHICH AGAIN ARE TRACEABLE TO TOTEMISM A THEORY WHICH WE NEED NOT HERE DISCUSS
5688-41232-0025 DURKHEIM IS BROUGHT FACE TO FACE WITH THE GROUP OF CONCEPTIONS THAT NOW CONCERN US HE INSISTS ON THE EXTREME AMBIGUITY FOUND IN PRIMITIVE CULTURE CONCERNING THE NOTION OF THE DIVINE AND THE CLOSE CONNECTION BETWEEN AVERSION AND VENERATION
5688-41232-0026 AND POINTS OUT THAT IT IS NOT ONLY AT PUBERTY AND EACH RECURRENCE OF THE MENSTRUAL EPOCH THAT WOMEN HAVE AROUSED THESE EMOTIONS BUT ALSO AT CHILDBIRTH A SENTIMENT OF RELIGIOUS HORROR HE CONTINUES
5688-41232-0027 WHICH CAN REACH SUCH A DEGREE OF INTENSITY WHICH CAN BE CALLED FORTH BY SO MANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND REAPPEARS REGULARLY EVERY MONTH TO LAST FOR A WEEK AT LEAST CANNOT FAIL TO EXTEND ITS INFLUENCE BEYOND THE PERIODS TO WHICH IT WAS ORIGINALLY CONFINED
5688-41232-0028 AND TO AFFECT THE WHOLE COURSE OF LIFE A BEING WHO MUST BE SECLUDED OR AVOIDED FOR WEEKS MONTHS OR YEARS PRESERVES SOMETHING OF THE CHARACTERISTICS TO WHICH THE ISOLATION WAS DUE EVEN OUTSIDE THOSE SPECIAL PERIODS
5688-41232-0029 AND IN FACT IN THESE COMMUNITIES THE SEPARATION OF THE SEXES IS NOT MERELY INTERMITTENT IT HAS BECOME CHRONIC THE TWO ELEMENTS OF THE POPULATION LIVE SEPARATELY
5688-41232-0030 DURKHEIM PROCEEDS TO ARGUE THAT THE ORIGIN OF THE OCCULT POWERS ATTRIBUTED TO THE FEMININE ORGANISM IS TO BE FOUND IN PRIMITIVE IDEAS CONCERNING BLOOD NOT ONLY MENSTRUAL BLOOD BUT ANY KIND OF BLOOD IS THE OBJECT OF SUCH FEELINGS AMONG SAVAGE AND BARBAROUS PEOPLES
5688-41232-0031 THE PROHIBITION TO DRINK WINE THE BLOOD OF THE GRAPE FOUND AMONG SOME PEOPLES IS TRACED TO ITS RESEMBLANCE TO BLOOD AND TO ITS SACRIFICIAL EMPLOYMENT AS AMONG THE ANCIENT ARABIANS AND STILL IN THE CHRISTIAN SACRAMENT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR DRINKING BLOOD
5688-41232-0032 THROUGHOUT BLOOD IS GENERALLY TABOO AND IT TABOOS EVERYTHING THAT COMES IN CONTACT WITH IT NOW WOMAN IS CHRONICALLY THE THEATRE OF BLOODY MANIFESTATIONS AND THEREFORE SHE TENDS TO BECOME CHRONICALLY TABOO FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY
5688-41232-0033 A MORE OR LESS CONSCIOUS ANXIETY A CERTAIN RELIGIOUS FEAR CANNOT FAIL TO ENTER INTO ALL THE RELATIONS OF HER COMPANIONS WITH HER AND THAT IS WHY ALL SUCH RELATIONS ARE REDUCED TO A MINIMUM RELATIONS OF A SEXUAL CHARACTER ARE SPECIALLY EXCLUDED
5688-41232-0034 IN THE FIRST PLACE SUCH RELATIONS ARE SO INTIMATE THAT THEY ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE SORT OF REPULSION WHICH THE SEXES MUST EXPERIENCE FOR EACH OTHER THE BARRIER BETWEEN THEM DOES NOT PERMIT OF SUCH A CLOSE UNION IN THE SECOND PLACE THE ORGANS OF THE BODY HERE SPECIALLY CONCERNED
5688-41232-0035 ARE PRECISELY THE SOURCE OF THE DREADED MANIFESTATIONS THUS IT IS NATURAL THAT THE FEELINGS OF AVERSION INSPIRED BY WOMEN ATTAIN THEIR GREATEST INTENSITY AT THIS POINT
5688-41232-0036 IN ANY CASE INDEED THE SAME IDEAS BEING TRANSFERRED TO WOMEN ALSO COITUS PRODUCES WEAKNESS AND IT PREVENTS THE ACQUISITION OF SUPERNATURAL POWERS THUS AMONG THE WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA BOAS STATES
5688-41232-0037 ONLY A YOUTH WHO HAS NEVER TOUCHED A WOMAN OR A VIRGIN
5688-41232-0038 AFTER HAVING HAD SEXUAL INTERCOURSE MEN AS WELL AS WOMEN
5688-41232-0039 YET THE TWOFOLD INFLUENCE OF THE MENSTRUATING WOMAN REMAINS CLEAR WHEN WE REVIEW THE WHOLE GROUP OF INFLUENCES WHICH IN THIS STATE SHE IS SUPPOSED TO EXERT SHE BY NO MEANS ACTS ONLY BY PARALYZING SOCIAL ACTIVITIES AND DESTROYING THE POWERS OF LIFE
5688-41232-0040 OH MENSTRUATING WOMAN THOU'RT A FIEND FROM WHOM ALL NATURE SHOULD BE CLOSELY SCREENED HER POWERS ARE ALSO BENEFICIAL
5688-41232-0041 IS IN REGULAR COMMUNICATION WITH THE STARRY BODIES
5688-41232-0042 IN OUR OWN TIME THE SLOW DISINTEGRATION OF PRIMITIVE ANIMISTIC CONCEPTIONS AIDED CERTAINLY BY THE DEGRADED CONCEPTION OF SEXUAL PHENOMENA TAUGHT BY MEDIAEVAL MONKS FOR WHOM WOMAN WAS TEMPLUM AEDIFICATUM SUPER CLOACAM
5688-41232-0043 HAS LED TO A DISBELIEF IN THE MORE SALUTARY INFLUENCES OF THE MENSTRUATING WOMAN A FAIRLY WIDESPREAD FAITH IN HER PERNICIOUS INFLUENCE ALONE SURVIVES IT MAY BE TRACED EVEN IN PRACTICAL AND COMMERCIAL ONE MIGHT ADD MEDICAL QUARTERS
5688-41232-0044 IN THE GREAT SUGAR REFINERIES IN THE NORTH OF FRANCE THE REGULATIONS STRICTLY FORBID A WOMAN TO ENTER THE FACTORY WHILE THE SUGAR IS BOILING OR COOLING THE REASON GIVEN BEING THAT IF A WOMAN WERE TO ENTER DURING HER PERIOD THE SUGAR WOULD BLACKEN
5688-41232-0045 FOR THE SAME REASON TO TURN TO THE EAST NO WOMAN IS EMPLOYED IN THE OPIUM MANUFACTORY AT SAIGON IT BEING SAID THAT THE OPIUM WOULD TURN AND BECOME BITTER
5688-41232-0046 DECLARED THAT ONE OF THE WOMEN WORKERS MUST BE MENSTRUATING ALL THE WOMEN HINDUS MAHOMETANS ABORIGINAL GONDS ET CETERA SHOWED BY THEIR ENERGETIC DENIALS THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THIS SUPERSTITION
5688-41232-0047 ASKING WHETHER IT WAS TRUE THAT IF A WOMAN CURED HAMS WHILE MENSTRUATING THE HAMS WOULD BE SPOILED HE HAD KNOWN THIS TO HAPPEN TWICE ANOTHER MEDICAL MAN WROTE THAT IF SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE PATIENTS OF MENSTRUATING LADY DOCTORS
5688-41232-0048 A THIRD WROTE IN THE JOURNAL FOR APRIL TWENTY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT I THOUGHT THE FACT WAS SO GENERALLY KNOWN TO EVERY HOUSEWIFE AND COOK THAT MEAT WOULD SPOIL IF SALTED AT THE MENSTRUAL PERIOD THAT I AM SURPRISED TO SEE SO MANY LETTERS ON THE SUBJECT IN THE JOURNAL
5688-41232-0049 IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE FACT THAT MEAT WILL BE TAINTED IF CURED BY WOMEN AT THE CATAMENIAL PERIOD
5688-41232-0050 HAVE THOUGHT AND TAUGHT THAT THE PRESENCE OF A MENSTRUATING WOMAN WOULD POLLUTE SOLEMN RELIGIOUS RITES WOULD SOUR MILK SPOIL THE FERMENTATION IN WINE VATS AND MUCH OTHER MISCHIEF IN A GENERAL WAY INFLUENCED BY HOARY TRADITION
5688-41232-0051 BUT WHY THIS DELAY IF TIME IS PRECIOUS AND IT ENTERS AS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE CASE
5688-41232-0052 FOR BEING SWOLLEN THEN BY THE AFFLUX OF BLOOD
5688-41232-0053 THAN BY CURETTING THE WOMB DURING THE VERY FLOW WHILE I DO NOT SELECT THIS PERIOD FOR THE REMOVAL OF OVARIAN CYSTS OR FOR OTHER ABDOMINAL WORK SUCH AS THE EXTIRPATION OF THE OVARIES OR A KIDNEY OR BREAKING UP INTESTINAL ADHESIONS ET CETERA
5688-41232-0054 YET I HAVE NOT HESITATED TO PERFORM THESE OPERATIONS AT SUCH A TIME AND HAVE NEVER HAD REASON TO REGRET THE COURSE THE ONLY OPERATIONS THAT I SHOULD DISLIKE TO PERFORM DURING MENSTRUATION WOULD BE THOSE INVOLVING THE WOMB ITSELF
5688-41232-0055 IT MUST BE ADDED TO THIS THAT WE STILL HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION NOT MERELY THE SURVIVING INFLUENCE OF ANCIENT PRIMITIVE BELIEFS BUT THE POSSIBLE EXISTENCE OF ACTUAL NERVOUS CONDITIONS DURING THE MENSTRUAL PERIOD
5688-41232-0056 PRODUCING WHAT MAY BE DESCRIBED AS AN ABNORMAL NERVOUS TENSION IN THIS WAY WE ARE DOUBTLESS CONCERNED WITH A TISSUE OF PHENOMENA INEXTRICABLY WOVEN OF FOLK LORE AUTOSUGGESTION FALSE OBSERVATION
5688-41232-0057 THUS HE SPEAKS OF TWO YOUNG GIRLS OF ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN SLIGHTLY NEUROPATHIC BUT WITHOUT DEFINITE HYSTERICAL SYMPTOMS WHO DURING THE MENSTRUAL PERIOD FEEL THEMSELVES IN A SORT OF ELECTRICAL STATE
5688-41232-0058 WITH TINGLING AND PRICKLING SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS OF ATTRACTION OR REPULSION AT THE CONTACT OF VARIOUS OBJECTS THESE GIRLS BELIEVE THEIR GARMENTS STICK TO THEIR SKIN DURING THE PERIODS IT WAS ONLY WITH DIFFICULTY THAT THEY COULD REMOVE THEIR SLIPPERS THOUGH FITTING EASILY
5688-41232-0059 STOCKINGS HAD TO BE DRAWN OFF VIOLENTLY BY ANOTHER PERSON
5688-41232-0060 AN ORCHESTRAL PERFORMER ON THE DOUBLE BASS INFORMED LAURENT THAT WHENEVER HE LEFT A TUNED DOUBLE BASS IN HIS LODGINGS DURING HIS WIFE'S PERIOD A STRING SNAPPED CONSEQUENTLY HE ALWAYS REMOVED HIS INSTRUMENT AT THIS TIME TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE
5688-41232-0061 HE ADDED THAT THE SAME THING HAPPENED TWO YEARS EARLIER WITH A MISTRESS A CAFE CONCERT SINGER WHO HAD INDEED WARNED HIM BEFOREHAND A HARPIST ALSO INFORMED LAURENT THAT SHE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO GIVE UP HER PROFESSION
5688-41232-0062 BECAUSE DURING HER PERIODS SEVERAL STRINGS OF HER HARP ALWAYS THE SAME STRINGS BROKE ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE WAS PLAYING A FRIEND OF LAURENT'S AN OFFICIAL IN COCHIN CHINA ALSO TOLD HIM THAT THE STRINGS OF HIS VIOLIN OFTEN SNAPPED DURING THE MENSTRUAL PERIODS OF HIS ANNAMITE MISTRESS
5688-41232-0063 AND ARE CAREFUL NOT TO PLAY ON THEIR INSTRUMENTS AT THIS TIME TWO YOUNG LADIES BOTH GOOD VIOLINISTS ALSO AFFIRMED THAT EVER SINCE THEIR FIRST MENSTRUATION THEY HAD NOTED A TENDENCY FOR THE STRINGS TO SNAP AT THIS PERIOD
5688-41232-0064 ONE A GENUINE ARTIST WHO OFTEN PERFORMED AT CHARITY CONCERTS SYSTEMATICALLY REFUSED TO PLAY AT THESE TIMES AND WAS OFTEN EMBARRASSED TO FIND A PRETEXT THE OTHER WHO ADMITTED THAT SHE WAS NERVOUS AND IRRITABLE AT SUCH TIMES
5688-41232-0065 HAD GIVEN UP PLAYING ON ACCOUNT OF THE TROUBLE OF CHANGING THE STRINGS SO FREQUENTLY LAURENT ALSO REFERS TO THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH WOMEN BREAK THINGS DURING THE MENSTRUAL PERIODS AND CONSIDERS THAT THIS IS NOT SIMPLY DUE TO THE AWKWARDNESS CAUSED BY NERVOUS EXHAUSTION OR HYSTERICAL TREMORS
5688-41232-0066 BUT THAT THERE IS SPONTANEOUS BREAKAGE MOST USUALLY IT HAPPENS THAT A GLASS BREAKS WHEN IT IS BEING DRIED WITH A CLOTH NEEDLES ALSO BREAK WITH UNUSUAL FACILITY AT THIS TIME CLOCKS ARE STOPPED BY MERELY PLACING THE HAND UPON THEM
5688-41232-0067 I DO NOT HERE ATTEMPT TO ESTIMATE CRITICALLY THE VALIDITY OF THESE ALLEGED MANIFESTATIONS SOME OF WHICH MAY CERTAINLY BE EXPLAINED BY THE UNCONSCIOUS MUSCULAR ACTION WHICH FORMS THE BASIS OF THE PHENOMENA OF TABLE TURNING AND THOUGHT READING
5688-41232-0068 SUCH A TASK MAY BEST BE UNDERTAKEN THROUGH THE MINUTE STUDY OF ISOLATED CASES AND IN THIS PLACE I AM MERELY CONCERNED WITH THE GENERAL INFLUENCE OF THE MENSTRUAL STATE
5688-41232-0069 IN AFFECTING THE SOCIAL POSITION OF WOMEN WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE ELEMENTS THAT GO TO MAKE UP THAT INFLUENCE THERE IS ONLY ONE FURTHER POINT TO WHICH ATTENTION MAY BE CALLED
5688-41232-0070 I ALLUDE TO THE WAY IN WHICH THE MORE FAVORABLE SIDE OF THE PRIMITIVE CONCEPTION OF THE MENSTRUATING WOMAN AS PRIESTESS SIBYL PROPHETESS AN ALMOST MIRACULOUS AGENT FOR GOOD AN ANGEL THE PECULIAR HOME OF THE DIVINE ELEMENT
5688-41232-0071 THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL PHENOMENA OF MENSTRUATION WITH THE IDEAS OF TABOO ASSOCIATED WITH THAT STATE SANK INTO THE BACKGROUND AS CULTURE EVOLVED BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE IDEAS OF THE ANGELIC POSITION AND SPIRITUAL MISSION OF WOMEN
5688-41232-0072 THE MORE FAVORABLE ASPECT OF THE PRIMITIVE VIEW OF WOMEN'S MAGIC FUNCTION HAS NEVER QUITE DIED OUT THE GRADUAL DECAY AND DEGRADATION OF THE PRIMITIVE VIEW HAS ON THE WHOLE INVOLVED A LOWER ESTIMATE OF WOMEN'S NATURE AND POSITION
5688-41232-0073 WOMAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE WITCH SHE WAS SO EVEN IN ANCIENT BABYLONIA BUT SHE HAS CEASED TO BE THE PRIESTESS THE EARLY TEUTONS SAW SANCTUM ALIQUID ET PROVIDUM IN WOMEN WHO FOR THE MEDIAEVAL GERMAN PREACHER
5688-41232-0074 AND SCHOPENHAUER AND EVEN NIETZSCHE HAVE BEEN MORE INCLINED TO SIDE WITH THE PREACHER THAN WITH THE HALF NAKED PHILOSOPHERS OF TACITUS'S DAY BUT BOTH VIEWS ALIKE ARE BUT THE EXTREMES OF THE SAME PRIMITIVE CONCEPTION
5688-41232-0075 AND THE GRADUAL EVOLUTION FROM ONE EXTREME OF THE MAGICAL DOCTRINE TO THE OTHER WAS INEVITABLE IN AN ADVANCED CIVILIZATION AS WE SEE THESE IDEAS HAVING THEIR ULTIMATE BASIS ON THE OLD STORY OF THE SERPENT
5688-41232-0076 AND ON A SPECIAL AND MYSTERIOUS CONNECTION BETWEEN THE MENSTRUATING WOMAN AND THE OCCULT FORCES OF MAGIC TEND TO DIE OUT THE SEPARATION OF THE SEXES THEY INVOLVE BECOMES UNNECESSARY LIVING IN GREATER COMMUNITY WITH MEN
5703-47198-0000 ONE HOT SUMMER DAY A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE MARRIAGE JULIET RETURNING TO THE CONSULATE AFTER A MORNING SPENT IN VERY ACTIVE EXERCISE UPON A TENNIS COURT WAS MET ON THE DOORSTEP BY DORA THE YOUNGEST OF THE CLARENCY BUTCHERS
5703-47198-0001 WHO WAS AWAITING HER APPROACH IN A HIGH STATE OF EXCITEMENT HURRY UP JULIET SHE CRIED AS SOON AS SHE COULD MAKE HERSELF HEARD YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT THERE IS FOR YOU SOMETHING YOU DON'T OFTEN GET WHAT IS IT SAID JULIET COMING UP THE STEPS
5703-47198-0002 GUESS A PRESENT NO AT LEAST I SUPPOSE NOT BUT THERE MAY BE ONE INSIDE INSIDE OH THEN IT'S A PARCEL ASKED JULIET GOOD HUMOUREDLY SHE FELT A MILD CURIOSITY
5703-47198-0003 WHICH SHE FROM THE ADVANCED AGE OF TWENTY THREE COULD NOT LOOK UPON AS PARTICULARLY EXCITING NO NOT A PARCEL CRIED DORA DANCING ROUND HER IT'S A LETTER THERE NOW
5703-47198-0004 THEN WHY DO YOU SAY IT'S SOMETHING I DON'T OFTEN GET ASKED JULIET SUSPICIOUSLY I OFTEN GET LETTERS IT'S AN INVITATION TO THE GERTIGNES DANCE I EXPECT NO NO IT ISN'T IT'S A LETTER FROM ENGLAND
5703-47198-0005 IT'S VERY GOOD OF YOU TO TAKE SUCH AN INTEREST IN MY FATE JULIET REPLIED AS SHE PULLED OFF HER GLOVES AND WENT TO THE SIDE TABLE FOR THE LETTER AS A MATTER OF FACT SHE WAS A GOOD DEAL EXCITED NOW FOR WHAT THE CHILD SAID WAS TRUE ENOUGH
5703-47198-0006 SHE MIGHT EVEN HAVE GONE FURTHER AND SAID THAT SHE HAD NEVER HAD A LETTER FROM ENGLAND EXCEPT WHILE SIR ARTHUR WAS THERE ON LEAVE IT WAS A LARGE ENVELOPE ADDRESSED IN A CLERK'S HANDWRITING AND SHE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION AS SHE TORE IT OPEN
5703-47198-0007 THAT IT MUST BE AN ADVERTISEMENT FROM SOME SHOP DEAR MADAM WE SHALL ESTEEM IT A FAVOUR IF YOU CAN MAKE IT CONVENIENT TO CALL UPON US ONE DAY NEXT WEEK UPON A MATTER OF BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY
5703-47198-0008 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE YOU FURTHER DETAILS IN A LETTER BUT IF YOU WILL GRANT US THE INTERVIEW WE VENTURE TO ASK
5703-47198-0009 TO BE A REASONABLE PROBABILITY OF THE RESULT BEING OF ADVANTAGE TO YOURSELF TRUSTING THAT YOU WILL LET US HAVE AN IMMEDIATE REPLY IN WHICH YOU WILL KINDLY NAME THE DAY AND HOUR WHEN WE MAY EXPECT TO SEE YOU WE ARE YOURS FAITHFULLY
5703-47198-0010 SOLICITORS THE ADDRESS WAS A STREET IN HOLBORN JULIET READ THE LETTER THROUGH AND STRAIGHTWAY READ IT THROUGH AGAIN WITH A BEATING HEART WHAT DID IT MEAN WAS IT POSSIBLE SHE WAS GOING TO FIND HER OWN FAMILY AT LAST
5703-47198-0011 SHE WAS RECALLED TO THE PRESENT BY THE VOICE OF DORA WHOM SHE NOW PERCEIVED TO BE READING THE LETTER OVER HER SHOULDER WITH UNBLUSHING INTEREST SAY SAID DORA ISN'T IT EXCITING SOMETHING TO YOUR ADVANTAGE
5703-47198-0012 JUST WHAT THEY PUT IN THE AGONY COLUMN WHEN THEY LEAVE YOU A FORTUNE I BET YOUR LONG LOST UNCLE IN THE WEST HAS KICKED THE BUCKET AND LEFT YOU ALL HIS ILL GOTTEN GAINS MARK MY WORDS YOU'LL COME BACK FROM ENGLAND A LOVELY HEIRESS
5703-47198-0013 I DO WISH THE OTHERS WOULD COME IN THERE'S NO ONE IN THE HOUSE EXCEPT SIR ARTHUR WHERE IS HE SAID JULIET PUTTING THE SHEET OF PAPER BACK INTO THE ENVELOPE AND SLIPPING IT UNDER HER WAISTBAND YOU KNOW DORA
5703-47198-0014 I WONDER YOU AREN'T ASHAMED OF YOURSELF I'M SURPRISED AT YOU I SHOULDN'T HAVE READ IT IF YOU'D BEEN QUICKER ABOUT TELLING ME WHAT WAS IN IT RETORTED DORA IT'S NOT AT ALL A NICE THING TO PUT TEMPTATION IN THE WAY OF A LITTLE GIRL LIKE ME
5703-47198-0015 DO YOU SUPPOSE I'M MADE OF CAST IRON SHE DEPARTED WITH AN INJURED AIR AND JULIET WENT TO LOOK FOR THE CONSUL WHAT IS IT HE ASKED AS SHE PUT THE ENVELOPE INTO HIS HAND A LETTER YOU WANT ME TO READ NOT A PROPOSAL EH
5703-47198-0016 HULLO WHAT'S THIS HE READ IT THROUGH CAREFULLY WHY JULIET HE SAID WHEN HE HAD FINISHED THIS IS VERY INTERESTING ISN'T IT IT LOOKS AS IF YOU WERE GOING TO FIND OUT SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF DOESN'T IT
5703-47198-0017 AFTER ALL THESE YEARS WELL WELL YOU THINK I MUST GO THEN SHE SAID A LITTLE DOUBTFULLY GO OF COURSE I SHOULD GO IF I WERE YOU WHY NOT
5703-47198-0018 NO NO I SEE NO REASON TO SUPPOSE SUCH A THING I KNOW THE FIRM OF FINDLAY AND INCE QUITE WELL BY NAME AND REPUTATION OH I HOPE THEY WILL TELL ME WHO I AM CRIED JULIET HAVE YOU NO IDEA AT ALL FATHER
5703-47198-0019 NO MY DEAR YOU KNOW I HAVE NOT BESIDES I PROMISED LENA I WOULD NEVER ASK YOU ARE THE CHILD OF A FRIEND OF HERS THAT IS ALL I KNOW I THINK SHE SCARCELY REALIZED HOW HARD IT WOULD BE FOR YOU NOT TO KNOW MORE WHEN YOU GREW UP
5703-47198-0020 I OFTEN THINK THAT IF SHE HAD LIVED SHE WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU BEFORE NOW IF YOU PROMISED HER NOT TO ASK I WON'T ASK EITHER SAID JULIET LOYALLY BUT I HOPE THEY'LL TELL ME IT WILL BE DIFFERENT WON'T IT IF THEY TELL ME WITHOUT MY ASKING
5703-47198-0021 I THINK YOU MIGHT ASK SAID SIR ARTHUR IT IS ABSURD THAT YOU SHOULD BE BOUND BY A PROMISE THAT I MADE AND YOU MAY BE SURE OF ONE THING YOUR ASKING OR YOUR NOT ASKING WON'T MAKE ANY ODDS TO FINDLAY AND INCE
5703-47198-0022 IF THEY MEAN TO TELL YOU THEY WILL AND IF THEY DON'T YOU'RE NOT LIKELY TO GET IT OUT OF THEM AND WHEN SHALL I GO CRIED JULIET THEY SAY THEY WANT ME TO ANSWER IMMEDIATELY YOU KNOW OH WELL I DON'T KNOW
5703-47198-0023 IN A FEW DAYS YOU WILL HARDLY BE READY TO START TO MORROW WILL YOU I COULD BE READY EASILY SAID JULIET YOU'RE IN A GREAT HURRY TO GET AWAY FROM US SAID SIR ARTHUR WITH A RATHER UNEASY LAUGH NOT FROM YOU
5703-47198-0024 JULIET PUT HER ARM THROUGH HIS I COULD NEVER FIND ANOTHER FATHER HALF AS NICE AS THE ONE I'VE GOT BUT YOU COULD DO VERY WELL WITHOUT SO MANY DAUGHTERS YOU KNOW SHE SMILED AT HIM MOCKINGLY YOU'RE LIKE THE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE
5703-47198-0025 YOU OUGHT TO SET UP A SCHOOL FOR YOUNG LADIES I DON'T BELIEVE I SHALL BE ABLE TO GET ON WITHOUT MY ELDEST DAUGHTER HE REPLIED HALF SERIOUS STILL I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR YOU IF YOUR REAL PARENTS HAVE DECIDED TO OWN UP TO YOU
5703-47198-0026 AT ALL EVENTS IF THEY DO NOT TURN OUT DESIRABLE I SHALL STILL BE HERE I HOPE SO I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN LOSE ANYTHING BY TAKING THIS CHANCE OF FINDING OUT WHAT YOU CAN ABOUT THEM AT THIS POINT LADY BYRNE CAME INTO THE ROOM
5703-47198-0027 THE LETTER WAS PRODUCED AGAIN AND SHE JOINED HEARTILY IN THE EXCITEMENT IT HAD CAUSED YOU HAD BETTER START ON MONDAY SHE SAID TO JULIET THAT WILL GIVE YOU TWO DAYS TO PACK
5703-47198-0028 ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE HER ARTHUR SHE ADDED TURNING TO HER HUSBAND I WOULD LIKE A SHOT HE REPLIED BUT I CAN'T POSSIBLY GET AWAY NEXT WEEK I'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK ON HAND JUST NOW I SUPPOSE MY DEAR HE SUGGESTED DOUBTFULLY
5703-47198-0029 THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO RUN OVER WITH HER LADY BYRNE DECLARED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO DO SO SHE HAD ENGAGEMENTS SHE SAID FOR EVERY DAY OF THE FOLLOWING WEEK WHICH IT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION TO BREAK
5703-47198-0030 HAD SIR ARTHUR FORGOTTEN THAT THEY THEMSELVES WERE HAVING LARGE DINNER PARTIES ON TUESDAY AND FRIDAY WHAT SHE WOULD DO WITHOUT JULIET TO HELP HER IN PREPARING FOR THEM SHE DID NOT KNOW
5703-47198-0031 BUT AT LEAST IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT SOME ONE MUST BE THERE TO RECEIVE HIS GUESTS NO JULIET WOULD HAVE TO GO ALONE SHE WAS REALLY OLD ENOUGH TO BE TRUSTED BY HERSELF FOR THREE DAYS AND THERE WAS NO NEED THAT SHE COULD SEE
5703-47198-0032 SHE CAN GO ON MONDAY SEE THE LAWYERS ON TUESDAY AND COME BACK ON WEDNESDAY SAID LADY BYRNE THE HELPLESSNESS OF YOUNG GIRLS IS THE ONE THING I DISAPPROVE OF IN YOUR EUROPEAN SYSTEM OF EDUCATION
5703-47198-0033 SUPPOSING SHE IS DETAINED IN LONDON HE SAID WHAT SHOULD DETAIN HER DEMANDED HIS WIFE UNLESS IT IS THE DISCOVERY OF HER PARENTS AND IF SHE FINDS THEM I PRESUME THEY WILL BE CAPABLE OF LOOKING AFTER HER IN ANY CASE
5703-47198-0034 SHE CAN WRITE OR CABLE TO US WHEN SHE HAS SEEN THE SOLICITORS AND IT IS NO USE PROVIDING FOR CONTINGENCIES THAT WILL PROBABLY NEVER ARISE
5703-47198-0035 A LETTER WAS WRITTEN AND DISPATCHED TO MESSRS FINDLAY AND INCE SAYING THAT MISS BYRNE WOULD HAVE PLEASURE IN CALLING UPON THEM AT TWELVE O'CLOCK ON THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY AND JULIET BUSIED HERSELF IN PREPARATIONS FOR HER JOURNEY
5703-47198-0036 ON MONDAY MORNING SHE LEFT OSTEND IN THE COMPANY OF HER MAID IT WAS A GLORIOUS AUGUST DAY ON SHORE THE HEAT WAS INTENSE AND IT WAS A RELIEF TO GET OUT OF THE STIFLING CARRIAGES OF THE CROWDED BOAT TRAIN
5703-47198-0037 AND TO BREATHE THE GENTLE AIR FROM THE SEA THAT MET THEM AS THEY CROSSED THE GANGWAY ON TO THE STEAMER JULIET ENJOYED EVERY MOMENT OF THE JOURNEY AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY WHEN THE CROSSING WAS OVER IF SHE HAD NOT BEEN SO EAGER TO SET FOOT UPON HER NATIVE SOIL
5703-47198-0038 SHE LEANT UPON THE RAIL IN THE BOWS OF THE SHIP WATCHING THE WHITE CLIFFS GROW TALLER AND MORE DISTINCT AND FELT THAT NOW INDEED SHE UNDERSTOOD THE EMOTIONS
5703-47198-0039 WITH WHICH THE HEART OF THE EXILE IS SAID TO SWELL AT THE SIGHT OF HIS OWN LAND SHE WONDERED IF THE SIGHT OF THEIR COUNTRY MOVED OTHER PASSENGERS ON THE BOAT AS SHE HERSELF WAS MOVED AND MADE TIMID ADVANCES TO A LADY WHO WAS STANDING NEAR HER
5703-47198-0040 HAVE YOU BEEN AWAY FROM ENGLAND A LONG TIME SHE ASKED HER I HAVE BEEN ABROAD DURING A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD REPLIED THE PERSON SHE ADDRESSED A STERN LOOKING SCOTCHWOMAN WHO DID NOT APPEAR ANXIOUS TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION
5703-47198-0041 FROM HER SEVERE DEMEANOUR JULIET IMAGINED SHE MIGHT BE A GOVERNESS GOING FOR A HOLIDAY YOU MUST BE GLAD TO BE GOING HOME SHE VENTURED IT'S A FAR CRY NORTH TO MY HOME SAID THE SCOTCHWOMAN THAWING SLIGHTLY
5703-47198-0042 THERE MAY EVEN BE A SCOTCHMAN AMONG THE PORTERS YOU KNOW BY SOME CHANCE NO FEAR SAID HER NEIGHBOUR GLOOMILY THEY'LL BE LOCAL MEN I HAVE NAE DOUBT
5703-47198-0043 WHICH IS ONE OF THE BONNIEST THINGS YOU SEE ON THE CONTINENT TO MY WAY OF THINKING JULIET COULD GET NO ENTHUSIASM OUT OF HER AND LOOK WHICH WAY SHE MIGHT SHE COULD NOT SEE ANY REFLECTION ON THE FACES OF THOSE AROUND HER OF THE EMOTIONS WHICH STIRRED IN HER OWN BREAST
5703-47198-0044 IT HAD BEEN A ROUGH CROSSING IN SPITE OF THE CLOUDLESS SKY AND BROILING SUNSHINE AND MOST OF THE PASSENGERS HAD BEEN LAID LOW BY THE ROLLING OF THE VESSEL THEY DISPLAYED ANXIETY ENOUGH TO REACH LAND
5703-47198-0045 NO DOUBT SHE THOUGHT WHEN THE SHIP STOPPED AND THEY FELT BETTER THEY WOULD BE MORE DISPOSED TO A SENTIMENTALITY LIKE HERS SHE FOUND HER MAID WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE MOST SEA SICK OF THOSE ABOARD AND ASSISTED HER ASHORE
5703-47198-0046 PUT HER INTO A CARRIAGE AND MINISTERED TO HER WANTS WITH THE HELP OF A TEA BASKET CONTAINING THE DELICIOUS NOVELTY OF ENGLISH BREAD AND BUTTER IN HALF AN HOUR'S TIME THEY WERE STEAMING HURRIEDLY TOWARDS LONDON SHE WAS TO LODGE AT A SMALL HOTEL IN JERMYN STREET
5703-47198-0047 SHE WAS YOUNG STRONG AND HEALTHY AND THERE WAS NO REASON THAT TRIFLING DISCOMFORTS OF THIS KIND SHOULD AFFECT HER ENJOYMENT TO THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE BED INDEED SHE SHUT HER EYES IN MORE SENSES THAN ONE
5703-47198-0048 FOR SHE WAS ASLEEP THREE MINUTES AFTER HER HEAD TOUCHED THE PILLOW NOR DID SHE WAKE TILL HER MAID ROUSED HER THE NEXT MORNING
5703-47198-0049 OVER THE ROOFS OF THE HOUSES OPPOSITE SHE COULD SEE A BLUE STREAK OF SKY ALREADY THE AIR HAD LOST THE TOUCH OF FRESHNESS WHICH COMES EVEN TO LONDON IN AUGUST DURING THE FIRST HOURS OF THE MORNING
5703-47198-0050 AND THE HEAT IN THE LOW CEILINGED ROOM ON THE THIRD FLOOR WHICH JULIET OCCUPIED FOR THE SAKE OF ECONOMY WAS OPPRESSIVE IN SPITE OF THE SMALL SASH WINDOWS BEING OPENED TO THEIR UTMOST CAPACITY
5703-47198-0051 BUT JULIET ONLY LAUGHED TO HERSELF WITH PLEASURE AT THE BRILLIANCY OF THE DAY SHE FELT THAT THE WEATHER WAS PLAYING UP TO THE OCCASION AS BECAME THIS IMPORTANT MORNING OF HER LIFE FOR THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT SHE DID NOT DOUBT
5703-47198-0052 SHE WAS GOING TO HEAR TREMENDOUS NEWS THAT DAY MAKE WONDERFUL DISCOVERIES ABOUT HER BIRTH HEAR UNDREAMT OF THINGS
5703-47198-0053 AND IT WOULD NOT HAVE ASTONISHED HER TO FIND HERSELF CLAIMED AS DAUGHTER BY ANY OF THE REIGNING FAMILIES OF EUROPE SHE WAS PREPARED FOR ANYTHING OR SO SHE SAID TO HERSELF HOWEVER ASTOUNDING AND THAT BEING SO SHE WAS EXCITED IN PROPORTION
5703-47198-0054 ANYONE COULD HAVE TOLD HER THAT BY THIS ATTITUDE OF MIND TOWARDS THE FUTURE SHE WAS LAYING UP FOR HERSELF DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE LEAST IF NOT THE BITTEREST DISILLUSIONS BUT THERE WAS NO ONE TO THROW COLD WATER ON HER HOPES
5703-47198-0055 AND SHE FILLED THE AIR WITH CASTLES OF EVERY STYLE OF ARCHITECTURE THAT HER FANCY SUGGESTED WITHOUT ANY HINDRANCE FROM DOUBT OR MISGIVING SHE DRESSED QUICKLY IN THE GAYEST HUMOUR BUT WITH EVEN MORE CARE THAN SHE USUALLY BESTOWED UPON HER APPEARANCE
5703-47198-0056 SCANDALIZED AT THE IDEA OF SUCH A PRECIOUS GARMENT BEING PUT ON BEFORE BREAKFAST THAT VERY ONE JULIET ASSURED HER UNDAUNTED AND WAS ARRAYED IN IT IN SPITE OF OBVIOUS DISAPPROVAL AFTER BREAKFAST THEY WENT OUT
5703-47198-0057 AND INQUIRING THEIR WAY TO BOND STREET FLATTENED THEIR NOSES AGAINST THE SHOP WINDOWS TO THEIR MUTUAL SATISFACTION THEY HAD IT ALMOST TO THEMSELVES FOR THERE WERE NOT MANY PEOPLE LEFT IN THAT PART OF LONDON
5703-47198-0058 BUT MORE THAN ONE HEAD WAS TURNED TO GAZE AT THE PRETTY GIRL IN THE GARDEN PARTY DRESS WHO STOOD TRANSFIXED BEFORE SHOP AFTER SHOP THIS AMUSEMENT LASTED TILL HALF PAST ELEVEN WHEN THEY RETURNED TO THE HOTEL FOR JULIET TO GIVE THE FINAL PATS TO HER HAIR
5703-47198-0059 BEFORE SHE STARTED TO KEEP HER APPOINTMENT WITH THE SOLICITORS
5703-47212-0000 WITH HER WHITE PAINT AND HER SCARLET SMOKESTACK THE INVERASHIEL ONE OF THE TWO SMALL STEAMERS THAT DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS PLIED UP AND DOWN THE LOCH AND INCIDENTALLY CARRIED ON COMMUNICATION BETWEEN INVERASHIEL AND CRIANAN
5703-47212-0001 WAS A PICTURESQUE ADDITION TO THE LANDSCAPE AS SHE APPROACHED THE WOODEN LANDING STAGE THAT STOOD HALF A MILE BELOW THE PROMONTORY ON WHICH THE CASTLE WAS BUILT IT WAS THE MORNING OF FRIDAY THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FUNERAL
5703-47212-0002 IN SPITE OF THE BRILLIANT SUNSET OF THE PREVIOUS EVENING THE LOCH LAY DARK AND STILL ITS SURFACE WORE AN OILY TREACHEROUS LOOK EVERY DETAIL OF THE INVERASHIEL'S TUB LIKE SHAPE WAS REFLECTED AND BEAUTIFULLY DISTORTED IN THE WATER
5703-47212-0003 AS THE FEW PASSENGERS WHO WERE WAITING FOR HER CROSSED THE SHORT GANGWAY A SHOWER BURST OVER THE LOCH AND IN A FEW MINUTES HAD DRIVEN EVERY ONE INTO THE LITTLE CABIN EXCEPT THE TWO OR THREE MEN WHO CONSTITUTED THE OFFICERS AND CREW OF THE STEAMER
5703-47212-0004 ONE OF THESE WAS IN THE ACT OF SLACKENING THE ROPE BY WHICH THE BOAT HAD BEEN WARPED ALONGSIDE WHEN A RUNNING GESTICULATING FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DISTANCE SHOUTING TO THEM TO WAIT FOR HIM WAITED FOR ACCORDINGLY HE WAS AND IN A FEW MINUTES GIMBLET
5703-47212-0005 RATHER OUT OF BREATH AFTER HIS RUN HURRIED ON BOARD AND WITH A WORD OF APOLOGY AND THANKS TO THE OBLIGING SKIPPER TURNED LIKE THE OTHER PASSENGERS TOWARDS THE SHELTER OF THE CABIN WITH HIS HAND ON THE KNOB OF THE DOOR HE HESITATED
5703-47212-0006 THROUGH THE GLASS TOP HE HAD JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF A FIGURE THAT SEEMED FAMILIAR HE HAD SEEN THAT TWEED BEFORE THE SHORT GIRL WITH HER BACK TO HIM WAS WEARING THE DRESS IN WHICH HE HAD SEEN HER ON THE WEDNESDAY NIGHT
5703-47212-0007 SEARCHING AMONG LORD ASHIEL'S PAPERS IN THE LIBRARY AT THE CASTLE IT WAS JULIA ROMANINOV BEYOND A DOUBT AND GIMBLET DREW BACK QUICKLY AND TOOK UP HIS POSITION BEHIND THE FUNNELS ON THE AFTER DECK
5703-47212-0008 IN SPITE OF THE RAIN HE REMAINED THERE UNTIL THE BOAT REACHED CRIANAN LEANING AGAINST THE RAIL WITH HIS COLLAR TURNED UP AND HIS SOFT FELT HAT PULLED DOWN OVER HIS EARS SO THAT LITTLE OF HIM WAS VISIBLE EXCEPT THE TIP OF HIS NOSE
5703-47212-0009 HIS MIND ALWAYS ACTIVE WAS BUSIER THAN USUAL AS HE WATCHED THE RIPPLES ROLL AWAY IN ENDLESS SUCCESSION FROM THE SIDES OF THE INVERASHIEL WHICH LOOKED SO STRANGELY LESS WHITE ON CLOSER INSPECTION
5703-47212-0010 OR FOLLOWED THE SMOOTH SOARING MOVEMENTS OF THE GULLS THAT SWOOPED AND CIRCLED AROUND HER
5703-47212-0011 AS THEY DREW NEAR TO CRIANAN HE CONCEALED HIMSELF STILL MORE CAREFULLY BEHIND A PILE OF CRATES AND NOT TILL MISS ROMANINOV HAD LEFT THE STEAMER DID HE EMERGE FROM HIS HIDING PLACE AND STEP WARILY OFF THE BOAT
5703-47212-0012 THE YOUNG LADY WAS STILL IN SIGHT MAKING HER WAY UP THE STEEP PITCH OF THE MAIN STREET AND THE DETECTIVE FOLLOWED HER DISCREETLY LOITERING BEFORE SHOP WINDOWS AS IF FASCINATED BY THE DISPLAY OF SCOTTISH HOMESPUNS
5703-47212-0013 OR SAMPLES OF ROYAL STEWART TARTAN AND TAKING AN EXTRAORDINARY INTEREST IN FISHING TACKLE AND TROUT FLIES BUT THOUGH THE GIRL LOOKED BACK MORE THAN ONCE THE LITTLE MAN IN THE ULSTER WHO WAS SO INTENT ON PICKING HIS WAY BETWEEN THE PUDDLES
5703-47212-0014 DID NOT APPARENTLY PROVIDE HER WITH ANY FOOD FOR SUSPICION AND SHE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO SEE WHO WAS SO CAREFULLY SHELTERED BENEATH THE UMBRELLA HE CARRIED AT LAST THEY LEFT THE COBBLE STONES OF THE LITTLE TOWN AND EMERGED UPON THE HIGH ROAD
5703-47212-0015 WHICH HERE RAN ACROSS THE OPEN MOORLAND IT WAS DIFFICULT NOW TO CONTINUE THE PURSUIT UNOBSERVED AND GIMBLET BECAME ABSORBED IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF AN ENORMOUS CAIRNGORM
5703-47212-0016 WHICH WAS MASQUERADING AS AN ARTICLE OF PERSONAL ADORNMENT IN THE WINDOW OF THE LAST OUTLYING SHOP FROM THIS POSITION NOT WITHOUT ITS EMBARRASSMENTS SINCE A COUPLE OF BAREFOOTED CHILDREN CAME INSTANTLY TO THE DOOR WHERE THEY STOOD AND STARED AT HIM UNBLINKINGLY
5703-47212-0017 HE SAW THE RUSSIAN ADVANCING AT A RAPID PACE ACROSS THE MOOR AND LOOK WHERE HE WOULD COULD PERCEIVE NO MEANS OF KEEPING UP WITH HER UNOBSERVED UPON THE BARE SIDE OF THE HILL JUST AS HE DECIDED THAT THE DISTANCE SEPARATING THEM HAD INCREASED TO AN EXTENT
5703-47212-0018 WHICH WARRANTED HIS CONTINUING THE CHASE HE JOYFULLY SAW HER SLACKEN HER PACE AND AT THE SAME MOMENT A MAN WHO MUST HAVE BEEN SITTING BEHIND A BOULDER BESIDE THE ROAD ROSE TO HIS FEET OUT OF THE HEATHER AND CAME FORWARD TO MEET HER
5703-47212-0019 FOR TEN LONG MINUTES THEY STOOD TALKING DRIVING POOR GIMBLET TO THE DESPERATE EXPEDIENT OF ENTERING THE SHOP AND DEMANDING A CLOSER ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE CAIRNGORM IT IS HUMILIATING TO RELATE THAT HE RECOILED BEFORE IT WHEN IT WAS PLACED IN HIS HAND
5703-47212-0020 AND NEARLY FLED AGAIN INTO THE ROAD HOWEVER HE PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER AND HELD THE PROUD PROPRIETRESS A GAUNT GREY HAIRED WOMAN WITH KNITTING NEEDLES EVER CLICKING IN HER DEXTEROUS HANDS
5703-47212-0021 IN CONVERSATION UPON THE THEME OF ITS UNIQUE BEAUTIES UNTIL THE SUBJECT WAS EXHAUSTED TO THE POINT OF COLLAPSE EVERY OTHER MINUTE HE MUST STROLL TO THE DOOR AND TAKE A LOOK UP AND DOWN THE ROAD A FRIEND HE EXPLAINED HAD PROMISED TO MEET HIM IN THAT PLACE
5703-47212-0022 AND THOUGH THE SHOPWOMAN PLAINLY DOUBTED HIS VERACITY AND KEPT A SHARP EYE THAT HE DID NOT TAKE TO HIS HEELS WITH THE CAIRNGORM SHE DID NOT GO SO FAR AS TO SUGGEST HIS REMOVING HIMSELF FROM THE ZONE OF TEMPTATION
5703-47212-0023 AT LAST WHEN FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME HE PUT HIS NOSE ROUND THE DOORPOST HE SAW THAT THE PAIR HAD SEPARATED AND WERE WALKING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS THE GIRL CONTINUING ON HER WAY WHILE THE MAN RETURNED TO THE TOWN
5703-47212-0024 HE WAS INDEED NOT A HUNDRED YARDS OFF GIMBLET PLUNGED ONCE MORE INTO THE SHOP AND FASTENED UPON SOME PENCILS WITH A ZEAL NOT VERY CONVINCING AFTER HIS DISAPPOINTING VACILLATION OVER THE BROOCH
5703-47212-0025 WHICH SHE PRESSED UPON HIM AS PARTICULARLY SUITED TO HIS NEEDS AND CHARGED HIM FOURPENCE FOR BY THE TIME HE ISSUED FORTH INTO THE OPEN AIR HIS POCKETS FULL OF PACKAGES THE STRANGER HAD PASSED THE SHOP AND WAS TURNING THE CORNER OF THE NEXT HOUSE
5703-47212-0026 TO HIM NOW GIMBLET DEVOTED HIS POWERS OF SHADOWING THERE WAS NO GREAT DIFFICULTY ABOUT IT THE MAN WALKED STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM LOOKING NEITHER TO THE RIGHT NOR TO THE LEFT
5703-47212-0027 NARROW POINTED FOOTPRINTS THAT WERE DEEPLY IMPRESSED IN THE MUDDY PLACES HE HAD NO DOUBT THEY WERE THE SAME AS THOSE HE HAD NOTICED ON THE BEACH ON THE DAY OF HIS ARRIVAL AT INVERASHIEL
5703-47212-0028 THE STRANGER TURNED INTO THE CRIANAN HOTEL WHICH STANDS ON THE LAKE FRONT FIFTY YARDS FROM THE LANDING PLACE OF THE LOCH STEAMERS GIMBLET PASSED THE DOOR WITHOUT PAUSING AND WENT DOWN TO THE LOCH WHERE HE MINGLED WITH THE BOATMEN AND LOAFERS WHO CONGREGATED BY THE WATERSIDE
5703-47212-0029 HE KEPT HOWEVER A STRICT EYE ON THE DOOR OF THE HOTEL AND AFTER A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SAW THE OBJECT OF HIS ATTENTIONS EMERGE WITH FISHING ROD AND BASKET
5703-47212-0030 BUT NOW HE HAD A GOOD LOOK AS HE PASSED CLOSE BESIDE HIM HE WAS A TALL FAIR MAN EVIDENTLY A FOREIGNER BUT WITH NOTHING VERY STRIKING ABOUT HIS APPEARANCE A POINTED YELLOW BEARD HID THE LOWER PART OF HIS FACE
5703-47212-0031 AND FOR THE REST HIS NOSE WAS SHORT HIS EYES BLUE AND CLOSE TOGETHER AND HIS FOREHEAD HIGH AND NARROW HE LOOKED CLOSELY AT GIMBLET AS HE WENT BY AND FOR A MOMENT THE EYES OF THE TWO MEN MET
5703-47212-0032 BOTH EQUALLY INSCRUTABLE AND UNFLINCHING THEN THE STRANGER GLANCED ASIDE AND STRODE ON TO WHERE A SMALL BOAT LAY MOORED THE DETECTIVE TURNED HIS BACK WHILE THE FAIR MAN GOT IN AND PUSHED OFF INTO THE LOCH GENTLEMAN GOING FISHING
5703-47212-0033 HE'S AXTRA FOND O THE FEESHIN WAS THE REPLY FOR A THAT HE'S A FOREIGN SHENTLEMAN WAITING TILL THE BOAT HAD BECOME A DISTANT SPECK ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS GIMBLET MADE HIS WAY INTO THE INN AND ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH THE LANDLORD
5703-47212-0034 ON THE PRETEXT OF ENGAGING ROOMS FOR A FRIEND THE LANDLORD WAS SORRY BUT THE HOUSE WAS FULL
5703-47212-0035 FOLKS TAK THEIR ROOMS A MONTH IN ADVANCE THEY COME HERE FOR THE FISHIN ON THE LOCH
5703-47212-0036 INDEED I CAN WELL BELIEVE THAT GIMBLET ASSURED HIM I SUPPOSE YOU GET A LOT OF TOURISTS PASSING THROUGH THOUGH AMERICANS FOR INSTANCE
5703-47212-0037 I SELDOM HAE AN AMERICAN BIDIN HERE THEY MAISTLY GANG DOON THE LOCH SAID THE INNKEEPER I THOUGHT SAID GIMBLET THAT WAS A FOREIGN LOOKING MAN WHOM I SAW A LITTLE WHILE AGO COMING OUT OF THE HOTEL
5703-47212-0038 A POLISH GINTLEMAN HE IS COUNT PRETOVSKY A VARY NICE GINTLEMAN I COULDNA JUST CAE HIM A TOURIST HE'S VARY KEEN ON THE FISHIN
5703-47212-0039 A GREAT MANY SPORTING FOREIGNERS COME TO OUR ISLAND NOWADAYS GIMBLET REMARKED DOES HE GET MANY FISH
5703-47212-0040 DEAR ME SAID GIMBLET JUST WHAT MY FRIEND WANTS I'M SORRY YOU CAN'T TAKE HIM IN I MUST TELL HIM TO WRITE IN GOOD TIME NEXT YEAR IF HE WANTS A ROOM AS HE PARTED FROM THE LANDLORD UPON THE DOORSTEP OF THE CRIANAN HOTEL THE ROB ROY
5703-47212-0041 THE SECOND OF THE TWO LOCH STEAMERS WAS EDGING AWAY FROM THE PIER UNDER A CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE FROM HER FUNNEL THE RAIN HAD STOPPED THE PASSENGERS WERE SCATTERED ON THE DECK
5703-47212-0042 AND IN THE BOWS OF THE VESSEL THE DETECTIVE CAUGHT SIGHT OF JULIA ROMANINOV'S TWEED CLAD FORM SHE WAS LEANING AGAINST THE RAIL AND GAZING AT A DISTANT PART OF THE LOCH WHERE A BLACK SPECK
5703-47212-0043 IT WAS AS GIMBLET HAD EXPECTED AND THOUGH HE CHAFED AT THE DELAY HE REGRETTED LESS THAN HE WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE THAT HE COULD NOT CATCH THE ROB ROY THE INVERASHIEL WOULD BE DUE ON HER HOMEWARD TRIP IN A COUPLE OF HOURS TIME
5703-47212-0044 AND MEANWHILE HE HAD OTHER BUSINESS THAT MUST BE ATTENDED TO HE WENT FIRST TO THE POST OFFICE WHERE HE REGISTERED AND POSTED TO SCOTLAND YARD A PACKET HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM THEN AFTER ASKING HIS WAY OF THE SOCIABLE LANDLORD OF THE HOTEL
5703-47212-0045 HE PROCEEDED TO THE POLICE STATION A SINGLE STORIED STONE BUILDING STANDING AT THE END OF A SIDE STREET HERE HE MADE HIMSELF KNOWN TO THE INSPECTOR AND IMPARTED INFORMATION WHICH MADE THAT PERSONAGE OPEN HIS EYES CONSIDERABLY WIDER THAN WAS HIS CUSTOM
5703-47212-0046 IF YOU WILL BRING ONE OF YOUR MEN AND COME WITH ME YOURSELF SAID GIMBLET AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE INTERVIEW
5703-47212-0047 IN THE MEANTIME THERE WILL BE NO HARM DONE BY A WATCH BEING KEPT ON THE FOREIGN GENTLEMAN WHO IS AT THIS MOMENT TROLLING FOR SALMON ON THE LOCH THE INSPECTOR AGREED AND WHEN THE INVERASHIEL STARTED AN HOUR LATER ON HER VOYAGE DOWN THE LOCH
5703-47212-0048 SHE CARRIED THE TWO POLICEMEN ON HER DECK AS WELL AS THE MOST NOTORIOUS DETECTIVE SHE WAS EVER LIKELY TO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF CONVEYING IT WAS NEARLY THREE O'CLOCK WHEN THEY LANDED ON THE INVERASHIEL PIER
5703-47212-0049 THE WEATHER WHICH FOR THE LAST FEW HOURS HAD LOOKED LIKE CLEARING HAD NOW TURNED DEFINITELY TO RAIN CLOUDS HAD DESCENDED ON THE HILLS AND THE TREES IN THE VALLEYS STOOPED AND DRIPPED IN THE SATURATED MIST LADEN AIR
5703-47212-0050 GIMBLET CONDUCTED THE MEN TO THE COTTAGE WHERE LADY RUTH ANXIOUSLY AWAITED THEM IF YOU DON'T MIND THEIR STAYING HERE HE SUGGESTED TO HER WHILE I GO UP TO THE CASTLE AND CONSULT LORD ASHIEL ABOUT A MAGISTRATE IT WILL BE MOST CONVENIENT ON ACCOUNT OF THE DISTANCE
5703-47212-0051 BY ALL MEANS SAID LADY RUTH I FEEL SAFER WITH THEM I EXPECT YOU WILL FIND MISS BYRNE UP THERE SHE HAS NOT COME IN TO LUNCH AND I THINK SHE PROBABLY MET MARK AND WENT TO LUNCH AT THE CASTLE SHE OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER THAN TO GO TO LUNCH ALONE WITH A YOUNG MAN
5703-47212-0052 AND I AM JUST WONDERING IF SHE HAS CHANGED HER MIND AND ACCEPTED HIM AFTER ALL GIRLS ARE KITTLE CATTLE BUT I'VE GOT QUITE FOND OF THAT ONE AND I HOPE SHE'S NOT FORGOTTEN POOR DAVID SO SOON I REALLY AM FEELING ANXIOUS ABOUT HER
5750-100289-0000 THE CONTRARY IS TRUE WHAT WE NEED IS NOT LESS EDUCATION BUT MORE MORE TRAINED LEADERS TO UPHOLD THE STANDARDS OF CIVILIZATION BEFORE BOTH RACES AMONG INDIAN COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY GRADUATES A FAILURE IS VERY RARE
5750-100289-0001 I AM SURE I HAVE NOT MET ONE AND REALLY DO NOT KNOW OF ONE THE PRESS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY POPULAR ERRORS WHENEVER AN INDIAN INDULGES IN ANY NOTORIOUS MISBEHAVIOR HE IS WIDELY HERALDED AS A CARLISLE GRADUATE
5750-100289-0002 ALTHOUGH BECAUSE OF THE WONDERFUL ATHLETIC PROWESS OF ITS STUDENTS THEY HAVE MET AND DEFEATED THE ATHLETES OF MANY A WHITE UNIVERSITY ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD
5750-100289-0003 GIVING A FAIR KNOWLEDGE OF SOME TRADE TOGETHER WITH THE ESSENTIALS OF AN ENGLISH EDUCATION BUT NO LATIN OR OTHER FOREIGN LANGUAGE CONSEQUENTLY ITS GRADUATES MUST ATTEND A HIGHER PREPARATORY SCHOOL FOR SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE THEY CAN ENTER COLLEGE
5750-100289-0004 IT WILL BE SEEN THEN THAT THE COLLEGE EDUCATED MEN AND WOMEN OF MY RACE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED QUITE A FEAT CONSIDERING THEIR ANTECEDENTS AND WHOLLY FOREIGN POINT OF VIEW THEY HAVE HAD TO ADJUST THEMSELVES TO A NEW WAY OF THINKING
5750-100289-0005 FURTHERMORE THEY ARE ALMOST ALWAYS HAMPERED BY LACK OF MEANS NEVERTHELESS AN INCREASING NUMBER HAVE SUCCEEDED IN THE UNDERTAKING TRIALS OF THE EDUCATED INDIAN
5750-100289-0006 I WISH TO CONTRADICT THE POPULAR MISCONCEPTION THAT AN EDUCATED INDIAN WILL NECESSARILY MEET WITH STRONG PREJUDICE AMONG HIS OWN PEOPLE OR WILL BE EDUCATED OUT OF SYMPATHY WITH THEM FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW
5750-100289-0007 A PARTICULARLY ABLE OR WELL EQUIPPED MAN OF THEIR RACE IS A PUBLIC BLESSING AND ALL BUT PUBLIC PROPERTY THAT WAS THE OLD RULE AMONG US UP TO A VERY RECENT PERIOD AN EDUCATED INDIAN COULD NOT SUCCEED MATERIALLY
5750-100289-0008 HE COULD NOT BETTER HIMSELF BECAUSE THE PEOPLE REQUIRED HIM TO GIVE UNLIMITED FREE SERVICE ACCORDING TO THE OLD REGIME I HAVE EVEN KNOWN ONE TO BE KILLED BY THE CONTINUAL DEMANDS UPON HIM THERE WAS A TIME NOT SO LONG AGO EITHER
5750-100289-0009 WHEN THE EDUCATED INDIAN STOOD IN A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION BETWEEN HIS PEOPLE AND THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND SHADY POLITICIANS EVERY COMPLAINT WAS BROUGHT TO HIM AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND HE WAS EXPECTED TO EXPOSE AND REDRESS EVERY WRONG
5750-100289-0010 AS I HAVE SAID ELSEWHERE SUCH EFFORTS ARE GENERALLY USELESS AND RESULTED ONLY IN DAMAGE TO HIS FINANCIAL POSITION AND HIS REPUTATION NO DOUBT HE OFTEN INVITED ATTACKS UPON HIMSELF BY A RASHNESS BORN OF HIS ARDENT SYMPATHY
5750-100289-0011 FOR HIS FELLOW TRIBESMEN IN THIS MATTER I SPEAK FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS LONG OBSERVATION EVEN IN THE OLD WILD DAYS AN EDUCATION WAS APPRECIATED BY THE INDIANS
5750-100289-0012 BUT IT WAS A HARD LIFE FOR THE EDUCATED MAN THEY MADE HIM CARRY TOO HEAVY A BURDEN WITHOUT MUCH RECOMPENSE SAVE HONOR AND RESPECT BUT WE HAVE PRETTY WELL PASSED THROUGH THAT PERIOD AND THE NATIVE GRADUATES OF OUR HIGHER INSTITUTIONS
5750-100289-0013 HAVE BEGUN TO SHOW THEIR STRENGTH AND ENLARGE THEIR VIEWS THEY HAVE NOT ONLY DONE WELL FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR RACE BUT THEY STAND BEFORE THE WORLD AS LIVING ILLUSTRATIONS OF ITS CAPACITY DISPROVING MANY THEORIES CONCERNING UNTUTORED RACES
5750-100289-0014 NO INFERIOR RACE IT WAS DECLARED WITHOUT QUALIFICATION BY THE UNIVERSAL RACES CONGRESS AT LONDON IN NINETEEN ELEVEN THAT THERE IS NO INHERENTLY SUPERIOR RACE
5750-100289-0015 THEREFORE NO INFERIOR RACE FROM EVERY RACE SOME INDIVIDUALS HAVE MASTERED THE SAME CURRICULUM AND PASSED THE SAME TESTS AND IN SOME INSTANCES MEMBERS OF SO CALLED UNCIVILIZED RACES
5750-100289-0016 BECAUSE OF THE RACIAL ENVIRONMENT CHANGE THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE RACE IS TRANSFORMED CERTAINLY THE AMERICAN INDIAN HAS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THE TRUTH OF THIS ASSERTION
5750-100289-0017 THE VERY MENTION OF THE NAME INDIAN IN EARLIER DAYS WOULD MAKE THE AVERAGE WHITE MAN'S BLOOD CREEP WITH THOUGHTS OF THE WAR WHOOP AND THE SCALPING KNIFE
5750-100289-0018 A LITTLE LATER IT SUGGESTED CHIEFLY FEATHERS AND PAINT AND BUFFALO BILL'S WILD WEST TO DAY THE ASSOCIATION IS RATHER WITH THE CARLISLE SCHOOL AND ITS FAMOUS ATHLETES
5750-100289-0019 IT IS A FACT THAT THE INTELLIGENT AND EDUCATED INDIAN HAS NO SOCIAL PREJUDICE TO CONTEND WITH HIS COLOR IS NOT COUNTED AGAINST HIM HE IS RECEIVED CORDIALLY AND UPON EQUAL TERMS IN SCHOOL COLLEGE AND SOCIETY
5750-100289-0020 DOCTOR BOOKER WASHINGTON IS IN THE HABIT OF SAYING JOCOSELY THAT THE NEGRO BLOOD IS THE STRONGEST IN THE WORLD FOR ONE DROP OF IT MAKES A NIGGER OF A WHITE MAN I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE INDIAN BLOOD IS EVEN STRONGER
5750-100289-0021 FOR A HALF BLOOD NEGRO AND INDIAN MAY PASS FOR AN INDIAN AND SO BE ADMITTED TO FIRST CLASS HOTELS AND EVEN TO HIGH SOCIETY
5750-100289-0022 IS TO GET AN EDUCATION AND HOLD UP HIS HEAD AS A MEMBER OF THE OLDEST AMERICAN ARISTOCRACY MANY OF OUR LEADING MEN HAVE MARRIED INTO EXCELLENT FAMILIES AND ARE PROMINENT IN CULTIVATED WHITE COMMUNITIES
5750-100289-0023 WE WANT THE BEST IN TWO RACES AND CIVILIZATIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR WHAT WE HAVE LOST SOME OF US HAVE ENTERED UPON EVERY KNOWN PROFESSIONAL CAREER SUCH AS MEDICINE LAW THE MINISTRY EDUCATION AND THE SCIENCES
5750-100289-0024 POLITICS AND HIGHER BUSINESS MANAGEMENT ART AND LITERATURE IT MAY BE WELL TO MENTION SOME OF OUR BEST KNOWN PROFESSIONAL MEN AND WOMEN
5750-100289-0025 AT FIRST TO BE SURE AS INDIAN HERB DOCTORS OR QUACKS OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER BUT LATER AS COMPETENT GRADUATED PHYSICIANS THE GOVERNMENT HAS UTILIZED SEVERAL IN THE INDIAN SERVICE AND OTHERS HAVE ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN PRIVATE PRACTICE
5750-100289-0026 SOME NOTED INDIANS OF TO DAY PERHAPS THE FOREMOST OF THESE IS DOCTOR CARLOS MONTEZUMA OF CHICAGO A FULL BLOODED APACHE
5750-100289-0027 WHO WERE ENEMIES OF HIS PEOPLE HE WAS BROUGHT TO CHICAGO BY THE MAN WHO RANSOMED HIM A REPORTER AND PHOTOGRAPHER AND WHEN HIS BENEFACTOR DIED THE BOY BECAME THE PROTEGE OF THE CHICAGO PRESS CLUB
5750-100289-0028 AND FROM THERE TO THE NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY WHERE HE WAS GRADUATED FROM THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT ALL THIS TIME ALTHOUGH RECEIVING SOME AID FROM VARIOUS SOURCES HE LARGELY SUPPORTED HIMSELF
5750-100289-0029 AFTER GRADUATION DOCTOR MONTEZUMA WAS SENT BY THE GOVERNMENT AS PHYSICIAN TO AN INDIAN AGENCY IN MONTANA AND LATER TRANSFERRED TO THE CARLISLE SCHOOL IN A FEW YEARS HE RETURNED TO CHICAGO AND OPENED AN OFFICE
5750-100289-0030 HE HAS BEEN A PROMINENT PHYSICIAN THERE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WAS RECENTLY MARRIED TO A LADY OF GERMAN DESCENT HE STANDS UNCOMPROMISINGLY FOR THE TOTAL ABOLITION OF THE RESERVATION SYSTEM AND OF THE INDIAN BUREAU
5750-100289-0031 HOLDING THAT THE RED MAN MUST BE ALLOWED TO WORK OUT HIS OWN SALVATION ONE OF THE EARLIEST PRACTITIONERS OF OUR RACE WAS DOCTOR SUSAN LA FLESCHE PICOTTE OF THE OMAHA TRIBE
5750-100289-0032 SHE HAS SINCE TAKEN UP PRIVATE PRACTICE AND ALSO HAD CHARGE OF A MISSION HOSPITAL DOCTOR PICOTTE IS A SISTER OF BRIGHT EYES SUSETTE LA FLESCHE AND ALSO OF FRANCIS LA FLESCHE OF WASHINGTON D C
5750-100289-0033 THERE IS ANOTHER INDIAN DOCTOR NOT OF FULL BLOOD WHO IS PRESIDENT OF THE CITY CLUB OF CHICAGO AND ACTIVE IN CIVIC REFORM IN SEVERAL MIDDLE WESTERN CITIES THERE ARE SUCCESSFUL DOCTORS AND DENTISTS OF MY RACE
5750-100289-0034 WAS A SUCCESSFUL LAWYER IN TOPEKA WHEN HE WAS ELECTED TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND LATER TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE HIS MOTHER IS A KAW INDIAN MISTER CURTIS WAS AND IS A LEADER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN HIS STATE
5750-100289-0035 SENATOR OWEN OF OKLAHOMA IS PART CHEROKEE THE WHOLE COUNTRY HAS COME TO REALIZE HIS ABILITY AND INFLUENCE REPRESENTATIVE CARTER OF OKLAHOMA IS ALSO AN INDIAN
5750-100289-0036 DURING MY STUDENT DAYS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE I WAS OFTEN TOLD THAT DANIEL WEBSTER WAS PART INDIAN ON HIS MOTHER'S SIDE CERTAINLY HIS PHYSIOGNOMY AS WELL AS HIS UNEQUALLED LOGIC CORROBORATED THE STORY
