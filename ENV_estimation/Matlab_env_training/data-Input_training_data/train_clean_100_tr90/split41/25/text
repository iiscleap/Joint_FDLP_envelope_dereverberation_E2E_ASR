4640-19187-0010 THEY HAD THEN REACHED THE FIRST HOURS OF THAT SPARTAN DAY OF THE SIXTH OF JUNE WHEN IN THE BARRICADE SAINT MERRY JEANNE SURROUNDED BY THE INSURGENTS WHO DEMANDED BREAD REPLIED TO ALL COMBATANTS CRYING SOMETHING TO EAT
4640-19187-0011 WITH WHY
4640-19187-0012 AS THEY COULD NO LONGER EAT
4640-19187-0013 HE INTERDICTED WINE AND PORTIONED OUT THE BRANDY THEY HAD FOUND IN THE CELLAR FIFTEEN FULL BOTTLES HERMETICALLY SEALED
4640-19187-0014 AND IN ORDER THAT NO ONE MIGHT TOUCH THEM HE HAD THEM PLACED UNDER THE TABLE ON WHICH FATHER MABEUF WAS LYING ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THEY RECKONED UP THEIR STRENGTH THERE WERE STILL THIRTY SEVEN OF THEM
4640-19187-0015 THE DAY BEGAN TO DAWN THE TORCH WHICH HAD BEEN REPLACED IN ITS CAVITY IN THE PAVEMENT HAD JUST BEEN EXTINGUISHED THE INTERIOR OF THE BARRICADE THAT SPECIES OF TINY COURTYARD APPROPRIATED FROM THE STREET
4640-19187-0016 THAT TORCH FLICKERING IN THE WIND ANNOYED ME IT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF BEING AFRAID THE LIGHT OF TORCHES RESEMBLES THE WISDOM OF COWARDS IT GIVES A BAD LIGHT BECAUSE IT TREMBLES
4640-19187-0017 DAWN AWAKENS MINDS AS IT DOES THE BIRDS ALL BEGAN TO TALK JOLY PERCEIVING A CAT PROWLING ON A GUTTER EXTRACTED PHILOSOPHY FROM IT WHAT IS THE CAT HE EXCLAIMED
4640-19187-0018 IT IS A CORRECTIVE THE GOOD GOD HAVING MADE THE MOUSE SAID HULLO I HAVE COMMITTED A BLUNDER AND SO HE MADE THE CAT THE CAT IS THE ERRATUM OF THE MOUSE
4640-19187-0019 HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON BRUTUS CHEREAS STEPHANUS CROMWELL CHARLOTTE CORDAY SAND HAVE ALL HAD THEIR MOMENT OF AGONY WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE
4640-19187-0020 OUR HEARTS QUIVER SO AND HUMAN LIFE IS SUCH A MYSTERY THAT EVEN IN THE CASE OF A CIVIC MURDER EVEN IN A MURDER FOR LIBERATION IF THERE BE SUCH A THING
4640-19187-0021 THE REMORSE FOR HAVING STRUCK A MAN SURPASSES THE JOY OF HAVING SERVED THE HUMAN RACE AND SUCH ARE THE WINDINGS OF THE EXCHANGE OF SPEECH THAT A MOMENT LATER BY A TRANSITION BROUGHT ABOUT THROUGH JEAN PROUVAIRE'S VERSES
4640-19187-0022 COMBEFERRE WAS COMPARING THE TRANSLATORS OF THE GEORGICS
4640-19187-0023 COURNAND WITH DELILLE POINTING OUT THE PASSAGES TRANSLATED BY MALFILATRE PARTICULARLY THE PRODIGIES OF CAESAR'S DEATH AND AT THAT WORD CAESAR THE CONVERSATION REVERTED TO BRUTUS
4640-19187-0024 CAESAR SAID COMBEFERRE FELL JUSTLY CICERO WAS SEVERE TOWARDS CAESAR AND HE WAS RIGHT THAT SEVERITY IS NOT DIATRIBE
4640-19187-0025 WHEN MAEVIUS INSULTS VIRGIL WHEN VISE INSULTS MOLIERE WHEN POPE INSULTS SHAKSPEARE WHEN FREDERIC INSULTS VOLTAIRE IT IS AN OLD LAW OF ENVY AND HATRED WHICH IS BEING CARRIED OUT
4640-19187-0026 THE BLADE BUT ANTIQUITY ADMITTED IT CAESAR THE VIOLATOR OF THE RUBICON CONFERRING AS THOUGH THEY CAME FROM HIM THE DIGNITIES WHICH EMANATED FROM THE PEOPLE NOT RISING AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE SENATE
4640-19187-0027 COMMITTED THE ACTS OF A KING AND ALMOST OF A TYRANT
4640-19187-0028 CAESAR IS STABBED BY THE SENATORS CHRIST IS CUFFED BY LACKEYS ONE FEELS THE GOD THROUGH THE GREATER OUTRAGE
4640-19187-0029 HE HAD MADE HIS WAY OUT THROUGH MONDETOUR LANE GLIDING ALONG CLOSE TO THE HOUSES THE INSURGENTS WE WILL REMARK WERE FULL OF HOPE
4640-19187-0030 THAN AS TO THEIR CAUSE MOREOVER SUCCOR WAS EVIDENTLY ON THE WAY TO THEM THEY RECKONED ON IT WITH THAT FACILITY OF TRIUMPHANT PROPHECY WHICH IS ONE OF THE SOURCES OF STRENGTH IN THE FRENCH COMBATANT
4640-19187-0031 THEY DIVIDED THE DAY WHICH WAS AT HAND INTO THREE DISTINCT PHASES
4640-19187-0032 AT NOON THE INSURRECTION OF ALL PARIS AT SUNSET REVOLUTION
4640-19187-0033 WHICH RESEMBLED THE WARLIKE HUM OF A HIVE OF BEES
4640-19187-0034 HE RETURNED FROM HIS SOMBRE EAGLE FLIGHT INTO OUTER DARKNESS HE LISTENED FOR A MOMENT TO ALL THIS JOY WITH FOLDED ARMS AND ONE HAND ON HIS MOUTH THEN
4640-19187-0035 FRESH AND ROSY IN THE GROWING WHITENESS OF THE DAWN HE SAID THE WHOLE ARMY OF PARIS IS TO STRIKE A THIRD OF THE ARMY IS BEARING DOWN UPON THE BARRICADES IN WHICH YOU NOW ARE
4640-19187-0036 AS FOR THE POPULACE IT WAS SEETHING YESTERDAY TO DAY IT IS NOT STIRRING THERE IS NOTHING TO EXPECT NOTHING TO HOPE FOR NEITHER FROM A FAUBOURG NOR FROM A REGIMENT YOU ARE ABANDONED
4640-19187-0037 A MOMENT OF INDESCRIBABLE SILENCE ENSUED IN WHICH DEATH MIGHT HAVE BEEN HEARD FLITTING BY THIS MOMENT WAS BRIEF
4640-19187-0038 SO BE IT LET US RAISE THE BARRICADE TO A HEIGHT OF TWENTY FEET AND LET US ALL REMAIN IN IT CITIZENS LET US OFFER THE PROTESTS OF CORPSES
4640-19187-0039 IT WAS HAILED WITH AN ENTHUSIASTIC ACCLAMATION NO ONE EVER HAS KNOWN THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO SPOKE THUS HE WAS SOME UNKNOWN BLOUSE WEARER A STRANGER
4640-19187-0040 AT A GIVEN MOMENT UTTERS IN A SUPREME FASHION THE DECISIVE WORD AND WHO VANISHES INTO THE SHADOWS AFTER HAVING REPRESENTED FOR A MINUTE IN A LIGHTNING FLASH THE PEOPLE AND GOD
4640-19187-0041 LET US GET OURSELVES KILLED HERE TO THE VERY LAST MAN
4640-19188-0000 CHAPTER FOUR MINUS FIVE PLUS ONE
4640-19188-0001 STILL GREAT AS WAS THIS OMNIPOTENCE A MURMUR AROSE
4640-19188-0002 HE RESUMED HAUGHTILY LET THOSE WHO ARE AFRAID OF NOT NUMBERING MORE THAN THIRTY SAY SO THE MURMURS REDOUBLED
4640-19188-0003 YOU WOULD FALL IN WITH SOME GRAND GUARD OF THE LINE OR THE SUBURBS
4640-19188-0004 ENTERED THE TAP ROOM THEY EMERGED THENCE A MOMENT LATER
4640-19188-0005 COME SAID HE YOU MUST HAVE A LITTLE PITY DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE QUESTION IS HERE IT IS A QUESTION OF WOMEN SEE HERE ARE THERE WOMEN OR ARE THERE NOT ARE THERE CHILDREN OR ARE THERE NOT

4640-19188-0007 DIE IF YOU WILL BUT DON'T MAKE OTHERS DIE SUICIDES LIKE THAT WHICH IS ON THE BRINK OF ACCOMPLISHMENT HERE ARE SUBLIME BUT SUICIDE IS NARROW AND DOES NOT ADMIT OF EXTENSION
4640-19188-0008 AND AS SOON AS IT TOUCHES YOUR NEIGHBORS SUICIDE IS MURDER THINK OF THE LITTLE BLOND HEADS THINK OF THE WHITE LOCKS
4640-19188-0009 ON THE FIFTH FLOOR AND ON THE PANE THE QUIVERING SHADOW OF THE HEAD OF AN OLD WOMAN WHO HAD THE AIR OF HAVING SPENT THE NIGHT IN WATCHING PERHAPS SHE IS THE MOTHER OF SOME ONE OF YOU
4640-19188-0010 LET HIM FEEL AT EASE THE TASK HERE WILL BE PERFORMED ALL THE SAME WHEN ONE SUPPORTS ONE'S RELATIVES BY ONE'S TOIL ONE HAS NOT THE RIGHT TO SACRIFICE ONE'S SELF
4640-19188-0011 THAT IS DESERTING ONE'S FAMILY AND THOSE WHO HAVE DAUGHTERS WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF YOU GET YOURSELVES KILLED YOU ARE DEAD THAT IS WELL AND TOMORROW YOUNG GIRLS WITHOUT BREAD THAT IS A TERRIBLE THING
4640-19188-0012 WHO SING AND PRATTLE WHO ARE LIKE A LIVING PERFUME WHO PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF ANGELS IN HEAVEN BY THE PURITY OF VIRGINS ON EARTH
4640-19188-0013 THOSE ADORABLE AND HONEST CREATURES WHO ARE YOUR BLESSINGS AND YOUR PRIDE AH GOOD GOD THEY WILL SUFFER HUNGER WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY TO YOU
4640-19188-0014 THINK OF THE SHOPS PAST WHICH WOMEN GO AND COME WITH NECKS ALL BARE AND THROUGH THE MIRE THESE WOMEN TOO WERE PURE ONCE THINK OF YOUR SISTERS THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE THEM
4640-19188-0015 YOU ARE NO LONGER ON HAND THAT IS WELL YOU HAVE WISHED TO RELEASE THE PEOPLE FROM ROYALTY AND YOU DELIVER OVER YOUR DAUGHTERS TO THE POLICE FRIENDS HAVE A CARE HAVE MERCY
4640-19188-0016 WE PREVENT THEIR OCCUPYING THEMSELVES WITH POLITICS WILL YOU PREVENT THEM FROM GOING TO THE DEAD HOUSE THIS EVENING AND RECOGNIZING YOUR BODIES LET US SEE THOSE WHO HAVE FAMILIES MUST BE TRACTABLE
4640-19188-0017 AND SHAKE HANDS WITH US AND TAKE THEMSELVES OFF AND LEAVE US HERE ALONE TO ATTEND TO THIS AFFAIR I KNOW WELL THAT COURAGE IS REQUIRED TO LEAVE THAT IT IS HARD BUT THE HARDER IT IS THE MORE MERITORIOUS
4640-19188-0018 YOU SAY I HAVE A GUN I AM AT THE BARRICADE SO MUCH THE WORSE I SHALL REMAIN THERE SO MUCH THE WORSE IS EASILY SAID MY FRIENDS THERE IS A MORROW YOU WILL NOT BE HERE TO MORROW
4640-19188-0019 BUT YOUR FAMILIES WILL AND WHAT SUFFERINGS SEE HERE IS A PRETTY HEALTHY CHILD WITH CHEEKS LIKE AN APPLE WHO BABBLES PRATTLES CHATTERS WHO LAUGHS WHO SMELLS SWEET BENEATH YOUR KISS
4640-19188-0020 AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT BECOMES OF HIM WHEN HE IS ABANDONED I HAVE SEEN ONE A VERY SMALL CREATURE NO TALLER THAN THAT HIS FATHER WAS DEAD POOR PEOPLE HAD TAKEN HIM IN OUT OF CHARITY
4640-19188-0021 AND WHOSE PIPE YOU KNOW WAS OF MASTIC AND YELLOW CLAY HIS BREATHING WAS HOARSE HIS FACE LIVID HIS LIMBS FLACCID HIS BELLY PROMINENT HE SAID NOTHING IF YOU SPOKE TO HIM HE DID NOT ANSWER
4640-19188-0022 HE IS DEAD HE WAS TAKEN TO THE NECKER HOSPITAL WHERE I SAW HIM I WAS HOUSE SURGEON IN THAT HOSPITAL
4640-19188-0023 THAT POOR BRAT I REMEMBER AND I SEEM TO SEE HIM NOW WHEN HE LAY NUDE ON THE DISSECTING TABLE HOW HIS RIBS STOOD OUT ON HIS SKIN LIKE THE GRAVES BENEATH THE GRASS IN A CEMETERY
4640-19188-0024 STATISTICS SHOW THAT THE MORTALITY AMONG ABANDONED CHILDREN IS FIFTY FIVE PER CENT I REPEAT IT IS A QUESTION OF WOMEN IT CONCERNS MOTHERS IT CONCERNS YOUNG GIRLS IT CONCERNS LITTLE CHILDREN
4640-19188-0025 BUT YOU ARE NOT ALONE IN THIS WORLD THERE ARE OTHER BEINGS OF WHOM YOU MUST THINK YOU MUST NOT BE EGOISTS ALL DROPPED THEIR HEADS WITH A GLOOMY AIR
4640-19188-0026 STRANGE CONTRADICTIONS OF THE HUMAN HEART AT ITS MOST SUBLIME MOMENTS COMBEFERRE WHO SPOKE THUS WAS NOT AN ORPHAN HE RECALLED THE MOTHERS OF OTHER MEN AND FORGOT HIS OWN
4640-19188-0027 HE WAS ABOUT TO GET HIMSELF KILLED HE WAS AN EGOIST MARIUS FASTING FEVERED HAVING EMERGED IN SUCCESSION FROM ALL HOPE AND HAVING BEEN STRANDED IN GRIEF THE MOST SOMBRE OF SHIPWRECKS
4640-19188-0028 AND CLASSIFIED BY SCIENCE AND WHICH IS TO SUFFERING WHAT VOLUPTUOUSNESS IS TO PLEASURE DESPAIR ALSO HAS ITS ECSTASY MARIUS HAD REACHED THIS POINT
4640-19188-0029 HE BEHELD MEN GOING AND COMING AS THROUGH A FLAME HE HEARD VOICES SPEAKING AS AT THE BOTTOM OF AN ABYSS BUT THIS MOVED HIM THERE WAS IN THIS SCENE A POINT WHICH PIERCED AND ROUSED EVEN HIM
4640-19188-0030 HE HAD BUT ONE IDEA NOW TO DIE AND HE DID NOT WISH TO BE TURNED ASIDE FROM IT BUT HE REFLECTED IN HIS GLOOMY SOMNAMBULISM THAT WHILE DESTROYING HIMSELF
4640-19188-0031 IT IS YOUR DUTY RATHER RETORTED THE MAN YOU HAVE TWO SISTERS WHOM YOU MAINTAIN AND AN UNPRECEDENTED CONTROVERSY BROKE FORTH
4640-19188-0032 THIS IS THE REPUBLIC AND UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE REIGNS DO YOU YOURSELVES DESIGNATE THOSE WHO ARE TO GO THEY OBEYED AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF A FEW MINUTES FIVE WERE UNANIMOUSLY SELECTED
4640-19188-0033 AND STEPPED OUT OF THE RANKS THERE ARE FIVE OF THEM EXCLAIMED MARIUS THERE WERE ONLY FOUR UNIFORMS WELL BEGAN THE FIVE ONE MUST STAY BEHIND
4640-19188-0034 AND THEN A STRUGGLE AROSE AS TO WHO SHOULD REMAIN AND WHO SHOULD FIND REASONS FOR THE OTHERS NOT REMAINING THE GENEROUS QUARREL BEGAN AFRESH YOU HAVE A WIFE WHO LOVES YOU
4640-19188-0035 DO YOU DESIGNATE WHO IS TO REMAIN YES SAID THE FIVE CHOOSE WE WILL OBEY YOU MARIUS DID NOT BELIEVE THAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF ANOTHER EMOTION
4640-19188-0036 WHICH ONE BEHOLDS IN THE DEPTHS OF HISTORY HOVERING OVER THERMOPYLAE
4640-19188-0037 AND MARIUS STUPIDLY COUNTED THEM THERE WERE STILL FIVE OF THEM THEN HIS GLANCE DROPPED TO THE FOUR UNIFORMS AT THAT MOMENT A FIFTH UNIFORM FELL AS IF FROM HEAVEN UPON THE OTHER FOUR
4640-19188-0038 THE FIFTH MAN WAS SAVED
4640-19188-0039 THANKS TO HIS DRESS OF A NATIONAL GUARDSMAN HE HAD MADE HIS WAY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THE SENTINEL STATIONED BY THE INSURGENTS IN THE RUE MONDETOUR HAD NO OCCASION TO GIVE THE ALARM FOR A SINGLE NATIONAL GUARDSMAN
4640-19188-0040 AND HE HAD SILENTLY REMOVED HIS COAT AND FLUNG IT ON THE PILE WITH THE REST THE EMOTION AROUSED WAS INDESCRIBABLE
4640-19189-0000 THE PLENITUDE OF THE REVOLUTION HE WAS INCOMPLETE HOWEVER SO FAR AS THE ABSOLUTE CAN BE SO HE HAD TOO MUCH OF SAINT JUST ABOUT HIM AND NOT ENOUGH OF ANACHARSIS CLOOTS
4640-19189-0001 STILL HIS MIND IN THE SOCIETY OF THE FRIENDS OF THE A B C HAD ENDED BY UNDERGOING A CERTAIN POLARIZATION FROM COMBEFERRE'S IDEAS FOR SOME TIME PAST HE HAD BEEN GRADUALLY EMERGING FROM THE NARROW FORM OF DOGMA
4640-19189-0002 AND HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TO INCLINE TO THE BROADENING INFLUENCE OF PROGRESS AND HE HAD COME TO ACCEPT AS A DEFINITIVE AND MAGNIFICENT EVOLUTION
4640-19189-0003 A SORT OF STIFLED FIRE DARTED FROM HIS EYES WHICH WERE FILLED WITH AN INWARD LOOK ALL AT ONCE HE THREW BACK HIS HEAD HIS BLOND LOCKS FELL BACK LIKE THOSE OF AN ANGEL ON THE SOMBRE QUADRIGA MADE OF STARS
4640-19189-0004 THEY WERE LIKE THE MANE OF A STARTLED LION IN THE FLAMING OF AN HALO
4640-19189-0005 OLD MEN BLESSING CHILDREN THE PAST LOVING THE PRESENT THINKERS ENTIRELY AT LIBERTY BELIEVERS ON TERMS OF FULL EQUALITY FOR RELIGION HEAVEN GOD THE DIRECT PRIEST
4640-19189-0006 HUMAN CONSCIENCE BECOME AN ALTAR NO MORE HATREDS THE FRATERNITY OF THE WORKSHOP AND THE SCHOOL FOR SOLE PENALTY AND RECOMPENSE FAME WORK FOR ALL RIGHT FOR ALL
4640-19189-0007 PEACE OVER ALL NO MORE BLOODSHED NO MORE WARS HAPPY MOTHERS TO CONQUER MATTER IS THE FIRST STEP TO REALIZE THE IDEAL IS THE SECOND REFLECT ON WHAT PROGRESS HAS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED
4640-19189-0008 AND THE TALONS OF A TIGER FEARFUL BEASTS WHICH WERE ABOVE MAN MAN NEVERTHELESS SPREAD HIS SNARES CONSECRATED BY INTELLIGENCE AND FINALLY CONQUERED THESE MONSTERS
4640-19189-0009 ON THE DAY WHEN THIS PROMETHEAN TASK SHALL BE ACCOMPLISHED AND WHEN MAN SHALL HAVE DEFINITELY HARNESSED TO HIS WILL THE TRIPLE CHIMAERA OF ANTIQUITY THE HYDRA THE DRAGON AND THE GRIFFIN
4640-19189-0010 COURAGE AND ONWARD CITIZENS WHITHER ARE WE GOING TO SCIENCE MADE GOVERNMENT TO THE FORCE OF THINGS BECOME THE SOLE PUBLIC FORCE
4640-19189-0011 WE ARE ADVANCING TO THE UNITY OF MAN NO MORE FICTIONS NO MORE PARASITES THE REAL GOVERNED BY THE TRUE THAT IS THE GOAL CIVILIZATION WILL HOLD ITS ASSIZES AT THE SUMMIT OF EUROPE
4640-19189-0012 EUROPE WILL HAVE HER AMPHICTYONS THE GLOBE WILL HAVE ITS AMPHICTYONS FRANCE BEARS THIS SUBLIME FUTURE IN HER BREAST THIS IS THE GESTATION OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
4640-19189-0013 I REVERE YOU YES YOU CLEARLY BEHOLD THE FUTURE YES YOU ARE RIGHT YOU HAD NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER
4640-19189-0014 YOU ADOPTED HUMANITY FOR YOUR MOTHER AND RIGHT FOR YOUR FATHER YOU ARE ABOUT TO DIE THAT IS TO SAY TO TRIUMPH HERE CITIZENS WHATEVER HAPPENS TO DAY THROUGH OUR DEFEAT AS WELL AS THROUGH OUR VICTORY
4640-19189-0015 WHERE TWO OR THREE OF THESE SOVEREIGNTIES ARE COMBINED THE STATE BEGINS BUT IN THAT ASSOCIATION THERE IS NO ABDICATION EACH SOVEREIGNTY CONCEDES A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF ITSELF FOR THE PURPOSE OF FORMING THE COMMON RIGHT
4640-19189-0016 THIS QUANTITY IS THE SAME FOR ALL OF US THIS IDENTITY OF CONCESSION WHICH EACH MAKES TO ALL IS CALLED EQUALITY COMMON RIGHT IS NOTHING ELSE THAN THE PROTECTION OF ALL BEAMING ON THE RIGHT OF EACH
4640-19189-0017 THIS PROTECTION OF ALL OVER EACH IS CALLED FRATERNITY THE POINT OF INTERSECTION OF ALL THESE ASSEMBLED SOVEREIGNTIES IS CALLED SOCIETY THIS INTERSECTION BEING A JUNCTION THIS POINT IS A KNOT
4640-19189-0018 HENCE WHAT IS CALLED THE SOCIAL BOND SOME SAY SOCIAL CONTRACT WHICH IS THE SAME THING THE WORD CONTRACT
4640-19189-0019 A SOCIETY OF GREAT BLADES OF GRASS AND TINY OAKS A PROXIMITY OF JEALOUSIES WHICH RENDER EACH OTHER NULL AND VOID LEGALLY SPEAKING IT IS ALL APTITUDES POSSESSED OF THE SAME OPPORTUNITY
4640-19189-0020 POLITICALLY IT IS ALL VOTES POSSESSED OF THE SAME WEIGHT RELIGIOUSLY IT IS ALL CONSCIENCES POSSESSED OF THE SAME RIGHT EQUALITY HAS AN ORGAN GRATUITOUS AND OBLIGATORY INSTRUCTION
4640-19189-0021 AN IDENTICAL SOCIETY WILL SPRING YES INSTRUCTION LIGHT LIGHT EVERYTHING COMES FROM LIGHT AND TO IT EVERYTHING RETURNS CITIZENS THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IS GREAT BUT THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WILL BE HAPPY
4640-19189-0022 THEN THERE WILL BE NOTHING MORE LIKE THE HISTORY OF OLD WE SHALL NO LONGER AS TO DAY HAVE TO FEAR A CONQUEST AN INVASION A USURPATION A RIVALRY OF NATIONS
4640-19189-0023 ARMS IN HAND AN INTERRUPTION OF CIVILIZATION DEPENDING ON A MARRIAGE OF KINGS ON A BIRTH IN HEREDITARY TYRANNIES A PARTITION OF PEOPLES BY A CONGRESS A DISMEMBERMENT BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE OF A DYNASTY
4640-19189-0024 FROM THE FAILURE OF WORK AND THE SCAFFOLD AND THE SWORD AND BATTLES AND THE RUFFIANISM OF CHANCE IN THE FOREST OF EVENTS ONE MIGHT ALMOST SAY THERE WILL BE NO MORE EVENTS WE SHALL BE HAPPY
4640-19189-0025 AS THE PLANET AROUND THE LIGHT FRIENDS THE PRESENT HOUR IN WHICH I AM ADDRESSING YOU IS A GLOOMY HOUR BUT THESE ARE TERRIBLE PURCHASES OF THE FUTURE A REVOLUTION IS A TOLL
4640-19189-0026 OH THE HUMAN RACE WILL BE DELIVERED RAISED UP CONSOLED WE AFFIRM IT ON THIS BARRIER WHENCE SHOULD PROCEED THAT CRY OF LOVE IF NOT FROM THE HEIGHTS OF SACRIFICE
4640-19189-0027 A HEAP OF IDEAS AND A HEAP OF WOES HERE MISERY MEETS THE IDEAL THE DAY EMBRACES THE NIGHT AND SAYS TO IT I AM ABOUT TO DIE AND THOU SHALT BE BORN AGAIN WITH ME
4640-19189-0028 FROM THE EMBRACE OF ALL DESOLATIONS FAITH LEAPS FORTH SUFFERINGS BRING HITHER THEIR AGONY AND IDEAS THEIR IMMORTALITY THIS AGONY AND THIS IMMORTALITY ARE ABOUT TO JOIN
4640-19189-0029 AND CONSTITUTE OUR DEATH BROTHERS HE WHO DIES HERE DIES IN THE RADIANCE OF THE FUTURE AND WE ARE ENTERING A TOMB ALL FLOODED WITH THE DAWN
4640-19189-0030 HIS LIPS CONTINUED TO MOVE SILENTLY AS THOUGH HE WERE TALKING TO HIMSELF WHICH CAUSED THEM ALL TO GAZE ATTENTIVELY AT HIM IN THE ENDEAVOR TO HEAR MORE THERE WAS NO APPLAUSE
4640-19189-0031 JAVERT LACONIC
4640-19189-0032 LET THE READER RECALL THE STATE OF HIS SOUL WE HAVE JUST RECALLED IT EVERYTHING WAS A VISION TO HIM NOW HIS JUDGMENT WAS DISTURBED
4640-19189-0033 MARIUS LET US INSIST ON THIS POINT WAS UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE GREAT DARK WINGS WHICH ARE SPREAD OVER THOSE IN THE DEATH AGONY HE FELT THAT HE HAD ENTERED THE TOMB
4640-19189-0034 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS ALREADY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL AND HE NO LONGER BEHELD THE FACES OF THE LIVING EXCEPT WITH THE EYES OF ONE DEAD
4640-19189-0035 WHAT HAD HE COME THERE TO DO MARIUS DID NOT ADDRESS ALL THESE QUESTIONS TO HIMSELF BESIDES SINCE OUR DESPAIR HAS THIS PECULIARITY THAT IT ENVELOPS OTHERS AS WELL AS OURSELVES
4640-19189-0036 AND HAD NOT EVEN THE AIR OF HEARING HIM WHEN MARIUS RAISED HIS VOICE TO SAY I KNOW HIM
4640-19189-0037 AND IF SUCH A WORD CAN BE USED FOR SUCH IMPRESSIONS WE SHOULD SAY THAT IT PLEASED HIM HE HAD ALWAYS FELT THE ABSOLUTE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ADDRESSING THAT ENIGMATICAL MAN WHO WAS IN HIS EYES
4640-19189-0038 BOTH EQUIVOCAL AND IMPOSING MOREOVER IT HAD BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE HE HAD SEEN HIM
4640-19189-0039 THE FIVE CHOSEN MEN LEFT THE BARRICADE BY WAY OF MONDETOUR LANE
4640-19189-0040 ONE OF THEM WEPT AS HE TOOK HIS LEAVE BEFORE SETTING OUT THEY EMBRACED THOSE WHO REMAINED WHEN THE FIVE MEN SENT BACK TO LIFE HAD TAKEN THEIR DEPARTURE
4640-19189-0041 HE ENTERED THE TAP ROOM
4640-19189-0042 JAVERT REPLIED WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO KILL ME WAIT WE NEED ALL OUR CARTRIDGES JUST AT PRESENT THEN GIVE ME A DRINK SAID JAVERT
4640-19189-0043 THEY ADDED TO THE SYSTEM OF LIGATURES WHICH RENDERED EVERY ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE IMPOSSIBLE THAT SORT OF BOND WHICH IS CALLED IN PRISONS A MARTINGALE WHICH STARTING AT THE NECK
4640-19189-0044 FORKS ON THE STOMACH AND MEETS THE HANDS AFTER PASSING BETWEEN THE LEGS WHILE THEY WERE BINDING JAVERT A MAN STANDING ON THE THRESHOLD WAS SURVEYING HIM WITH SINGULAR ATTENTION
4788-294466-0000 MARY'S NETTLESOME BROWN PONY WAS HARD TO QUIET UNTIL JERRY REACHED OUT A STRONG BROWN HAND AND PATTED ITS HEAD MARY LIFTED STARTLED BLUE EYES JERRY WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT SHE ASKED

4788-294466-0004 SHE SMILED AT HER FRIEND MARY NOT WISHING TO APPEAR FOOLISHLY TIMID SAID IN AS COURAGEOUS A VOICE AS SHE COULD MUSTER OF COURSE WE'RE NOT AFRAID GOODBYE BOYS WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW
4788-294466-0005 FEELING ASSURED THAT THE GIRLS WERE ALL RIGHT THE BOYS WENT AT A GALLOP DOWN THE ROAD AND ACROSS THE DESERT VALLEY TO THE NEWCOMB RANCH
4788-294466-0006 THEY'RE NICE BOYS AREN'T THEY MARY SAID I'VE ALWAYS WISHED I HAD A BROTHER AND I DO BELIEVE JERRY IS GOING TO BE JUST LIKE ONE ALOUD DORA REPLIED I HAVE NOTICED THAT SOMETIMES HE CALLS YOU LITTLE SISTER TO HERSELF SHE THOUGHT

4788-294466-0008 PLEASE REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE ONLY ONE YEAR YOUNGER THAN I AM AND I REFUSE TO BE CALLED ELDERLY MARY SMILED FAINTLY BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SHE WAS STILL THINKING OF THE PAST WHEN SHE HAD BEEN A LITTLE GIRL WITH GOLDEN CURLS THAT HUNG TO HER WAIST A WONDERFULLY PRETTY WISTFUL LITTLE GIRL
4788-294466-0009 WHEN SHE SPOKE SHE SAID IT'S ONLY NATURAL THAT JERRY SHOULD CALL ME LITTLE SISTER OUR MOTHERS WERE LIKE SISTERS WHEN THEY WERE GIRL BRIDES I'VE TOLD YOU HOW THEY BOTH CAME FROM THE EAST JUST AS WE HAVE MY MOTHER MET DAD IN BISBEE WHERE HE WAS A MINING ENGINEER
4788-294466-0010 AND JERRY'S MOTHER TAUGHT A LITTLE DESERT SCHOOL OVER NEAR THE NEWCOMB RANCH SHE DIDN'T TEACH LONG THOUGH FOR THAT VERY FIRST VACATION SHE MARRIED JERRY'S COWBOY FATHER AFTER THAT MOTHER AND MISSUS NEWCOMB WERE GOOD FRIENDS NATURALLY BEING BRIDES AND NEIGHBORS
4788-294466-0011 WHEN JERRY AND I WERE LITTLE WE WERE PLAYMATES I SPENT DAYS AT THE RANCH SOMETIMES HER SWEET FACE WAS VERY SAD AS SHE ENDED WITH UNTIL MOTHER DIED WHEN I WAS EIGHT THEN YOU CAME EAST TO BOARDING SCHOOL AND BECAME LIKE A SISTER TO ME
4788-294466-0012 FAR BELOW THEM THE DESERT VALLEY STRETCHED MANY MILES SOUTHWARD TO THE MEXICAN BORDER THE GIRLS COULD SEE A DISTANT BLUE HAZE THAT WAS THE SMOKE FROM THE DOUGLAS COPPER SMELTERS THE LATE AFTERNOON SUN LAY IN FLOODS OF SILVER LIGHT ON THE SANDY ROAD AHEAD OF THEM
4788-294466-0013 IT WAS VERY STILL NOT A SOUND WAS TO BE HEARD NOW AND THEN A RABBIT DARTED PAST SILENTLY HOW PEACEFUL THIS HOUR IS ON THE DESERT MARY BEGAN GLANCING AT HER FRIEND WHO WAS RIDING SO CLOSE AT HER SIDE
4788-294466-0014 NOTICING THAT DORA WAS DEEP IN THOUGHT SHE ASKED LIGHTLY WON'T YOU SAY IT OUT LOUD WHY OF COURSE I WAS JUST WONDERING WHY JERRY HURRIED US AWAY SO FAST FROM LUCKY LOON'S ROCK HOUSE BECAUSE HE HAD TO DO THE MILKING MARY REPLIED SIMPLY
4788-294466-0015 DORA NODDED SO HE SAID THEN SHE HASTENED TO ADD OH DON'T THINK I'M INFERRING THAT JERRY TOLD AN UNTRUTH BUT YOU KNOW THAT SOME EVENINGS HE HAS STAYED WITH US FOR SUPPER AND MARY GLANCED UP STARTLED DORA BELLMAN SHE SAID

4788-294466-0017 I'M CRAZY ABOUT MYSTERIES AS YOU KNOW AND IF THERE REALLY IS ONE ABOUT THAT ROCK HOUSE I WANT TO TRY TO SOLVE IT SHE SAID NO MORE ABOUT IT JUST THEN AS THEY HAD REACHED THE OLD GHOST TOWN OF GLEESON
4788-294466-0018 IN THE LONG AGO DAYS WHEN THE TOWN HAD BEEN TEEMING WITH LIFE PICTURESQUE LOOKING MINERS AND RANCHERS HAD SAT THERE TILTED BACK SMOKING PIPES AND SWAPPING YARNS TODAY THE CHAIRS WERE EMPTY AN OLD MAN SHRIVELED
4788-294466-0019 GRAY BEARDED UNKEMPT BUT WITH KIND GRAY EYES DEEP SUNKEN UNDER SHAGGY BROWS STOOD IN THE OPEN DOOR HE SMILED OUT AT THEM IN A FRIENDLY WAY THEN BECKONED WITH A BONY FINGER
4788-294466-0020 I DO BELIEVE MISTER HARVEY HAS A LETTER FOR US DORA SAID THE OLD MAN HAD SHUFFLED INTO THE DARK WELL OF HIS STORE A MOMENT LATER HE REAPPEARED WITH SEVERAL LETTERS AND A NEWSPAPER GOOD
4788-294466-0021 DORA EXCLAIMED AS SHE RODE CLOSE TO THE PORCH THANKS A LOT SHE CALLED BRIGHTLY UP TO THE OLD MAN WHO WAS HANDING THE PACKET DOWN OVER THE SAGGING WOODEN RAIL HIS FRIENDLY TOOTHLESS SMILE WAS DIRECTED AT THE SMALLER GIRL
4788-294466-0022 HE SAID MIS FARLEY YER NURSE WOMAN CAME DOWN TER MAIL SOME LETTERS A SPELL BACK THEN BEFORE MARY COULD REPLY HE CONTINUED IN HIS SHRILL WAVERING VOICE
4788-294466-0023 PALE FELLAR WI SPECS ON IS HER SON AIN'T HE YES MISTER HARVEY DICK IS MISSUS FARLEY'S SON MARY TOOK TIME IN A FRIENDLY WAY TO SATISFY THE OLD MAN'S CURIOSITY
4788-294466-0024 DICK HAS BEEN GOING TO THE ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY THIS WINTER TO BE NEAR HIS MOTHER SHE'S A WIDOW AND HE'S HER ONLY SON HER HUSBAND WAS A DOCTOR AND THEY LIVED BACK IN BOSTON BEFORE HE DIED DEW TELL THE OLD MAN WAGGED HIS HEAD SYMPATHETICALLY
4788-294466-0025 BUSTIN BRONCS MARY SMILED IN APPRECIATION OF THE OLD MAN'S JOKE NO JERRY WON'T EXPECT DICK TO DO THAT RIGHT AT FIRST HE'S OFFICIAL FENCE MENDER JUST AT PRESENT DORA DEFENDED THE ABSENT BOY MISTER HARVEY
4788-294466-0026 YOU WAIT UNTIL DICK HAS BEEN ON THE DESERT LONG ENOUGH TO GET A COAT OF TAN HE MAY SURPRISE YOU
4788-294466-0027 SOME WITH BROKEN WINDOWS AND DOORS OTHERS WITH SAGGING ROOFS AND CRUMBLING WALLS THE ONLY SIGN OF LIFE WAS IN THREE SMALL ADOBES WHERE POOR MEXICAN FAMILIES LIVED BROKEN WINDOWS IN TWO OF THE HOUSES WERE STUFFED WITH RAGS
4788-294466-0028 A BRIGHT BLACK EYED MEXICAN BOY OF ABOUT TEN RAN OUT TO THE ROAD AS THE GIRLS APPROACHED COME ON EMANUEL MARY SANG DOWN TO HIM YOU MAY PUT UP OUR HORSES AND EARN A DIME THE SMALL BOY'S WHITE TEETH FLASHED IN A DELIGHTED GRIN
4788-294466-0029 HIS BROWN FEET RACED SO FAST THAT BY THE TIME THE GIRLS WERE DISMOUNTING BEFORE THE BIG SQUARE TWO STORIED ADOBE NEAR THE MOUNTAINS EMANUEL WAS THERE TO LEAD THEIR HORSES AROUND BACK MARY GLANCED AFFECTIONATELY AT THE OLD PLACE WITH ITS FLOWER EDGED WALK
4788-294466-0030 ITS BROAD PORCH AND ADOBE PILLARS HERE HER MOTHER HAD COME AS A BRIDE HERE MARY HAD BEEN BORN EIGHT HAPPY YEARS THEY HAD SPENT TOGETHER BEFORE HER MOTHER DIED AFTER MARY HAD BEEN TAKEN EAST TO SCHOOL HER FATHER HAD RETURNED
4788-294466-0031 THEN GLANCING UP AT THE NURSE WHO HAD APPEARED FROM HER FATHER'S BEDROOM SHE ASKED EAGERLY MAY I TELL DAD AN ADVENTURE WE'VE HAD MISSUS FARLEY MIDDLE AGED KIND FACED SHOOK HER HEAD SMILING DOWN AT THE GIRL NOT TONIGHT PLEASE WON'T TOMORROW DO
4788-91208-0000 IT LOOKS BIG AND IMPORTANT AND IT MAKES A GREAT NOISE EVEN PEOPLE A LONG WAY UP IN THE SCALE OF CIVILIZATION ARE IN THE HABIT OF TAKING THESE ATTRIBUTES PERHAPS NOT AS THE ESSENTIAL ONES OF LEADERSHIP BUT AT ALL EVENTS AS THOSE BY WHICH A LEADER MAY BE RECOGNIZED
4788-91208-0001 THE POINTSMAN MOVES A HANDLE AND THE FOAMING GIANT THAT WOULD IT MAY BE HAVE SPED ON TO HIS DESTRUCTION AND THAT OF THE PASSIVE CREW WHO FOLLOW IN HIS REAR IS SHUNTED TO ANOTHER LINE RUNNING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND TO A MORE DESIRABLE GOAL
4788-91208-0002 THE GREAT INTELLECTUAL POINTSMAN OF OUR AGE THE MAN WHO HAS DONE MORE THAN ANY OTHER OF THIS GENERATION TO GIVE DIRECTION TO THE THOUGHT OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES HAS PASSED AWAY AND WE ARE LEFT TO MEASURE THE LOSS TO HUMANITY BY THE RESULT OF HIS LABORS
4788-91208-0003 MISTER MILL'S ACHIEVEMENTS IN BOTH BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY ARE SUCH AS TO GIVE HIM THE FOREMOST PLACE IN EITHER WHETHER WE REGARD HIM AS AN EXPOUNDER OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF MIND OR THE PHILOSOPHY OF SOCIETY HE IS
4788-91208-0004 THE STRUCTURE RAISED BY ADAM SMITH MALTHUS AND RICARDO BUT RAISED IT AT LEAST ONE STORY HIGHER HIS INESTIMABLE SYSTEM OF LOGIC WAS A REVOLUTION IT HARDLY NEEDS OF COURSE TO BE SAID THAT HE OWED MUCH TO HIS PREDECESSORS
4788-91208-0005 THAT HE BORROWED FROM WHEWELL MUCH OF HIS CLASSIFICATION FROM BROWN THE CHIEF LINES OF HIS THEORY OF CAUSATION FROM SIR JOHN HERSCHEL THE MAIN PRINCIPLES OF THE INDUCTIVE METHODS THOSE WHO THINK THIS A DISPARAGEMENT OF HIS WORK MUST HAVE VERY LITTLE CONCEPTION
4788-91208-0006 OF THE MASS OF ORIGINAL THOUGHT THAT STILL REMAINS TO MISTER MILL'S CREDIT THE GREAT CRITICAL POWER THAT COULD GATHER VALUABLE TRUTHS FROM SO MANY DISCORDANT SOURCES AND THE WONDERFUL SYNTHETIC ABILITY REQUIRED TO WELD THESE AND HIS OWN CONTRIBUTIONS
4788-91208-0007 INTO ONE ORGANIC WHOLE WHEN MISTER MILL COMMENCED HIS LABORS THE ONLY LOGIC RECOGNIZED WAS THE SYLLOGISTIC
4788-91208-0008 IN DEDUCING FROM GENERAL PROPOSITIONS OTHER PROPOSITIONS LESS GENERAL IT WAS EVEN ASSERTED CONFIDENTLY THAT NOTHING MORE WAS TO BE EXPECTED THAT AN INDUCTIVE LOGIC WAS IMPOSSIBLE THIS CONCEPTION OF LOGICAL SCIENCE NECESSITATED
4788-91208-0009 SOME GENERAL PROPOSITIONS TO START WITH AND THESE GENERAL PROPOSITIONS BEING EX
4788-91208-0010 INCAPABLE OF BEING PROVED FROM OTHER PROPOSITIONS IT FOLLOWED THAT IF THEY WERE KNOWN TO US AT ALL THEY MUST BE ORIGINAL DATA OF CONSCIOUSNESS HERE WAS A PERFECT PARADISE OF QUESTION BEGGING THE ULTIMATE MAJOR PREMISE IN EVERY ARGUMENT BEING ASSUMED
4788-91208-0011 IT COULD OF COURSE BE FASHIONED ACCORDING TO THE PARTICULAR CONCLUSION IT WAS CALLED IN TO PROVE THUS AN ARTIFICIAL IGNORANCE AS LOCKE CALLS IT WAS PRODUCED WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF SANCTIFYING PREJUDICE BY RECOGNIZING SO CALLED NECESSITIES OF THOUGHT
4788-91208-0012 AS THE ONLY BASES OF REASONING IT IS TRUE THAT OUTSIDE OF THE LOGIC OF THE SCHOOLS GREAT ADVANCES HAD BEEN MADE IN THE RULES OF SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION BUT THESE RULES WERE NOT ONLY IMPERFECT IN THEMSELVES BUT THEIR CONNECTION WITH THE LAW OF CAUSATION
4788-91208-0013 WAS BUT IMPERFECTLY REALIZED AND THEIR TRUE RELATION TO SYLLOGISM HARDLY DREAMT OF MISTER MILL ALTERED ALL THIS HE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE GENERAL TYPE OF REASONING IS NEITHER FROM GENERALS TO PARTICULARS NOR FROM PARTICULARS TO GENERALS BUT FROM PARTICULARS TO PARTICULARS
4788-91208-0014 BUT ARE NOW DEAD WE ARE ENTITLED TO CONCLUDE THAT ALL HUMAN BEINGS ARE MORTAL WE MIGHT SURELY WITHOUT ANY LOGICAL INCONSEQUENCE HAVE CONCLUDED AT ONCE FROM THOSE INSTANCES THAT THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON IS MORTAL
4788-91208-0015 THE MORTALITY OF JOHN THOMAS AND OTHERS IS AFTER ALL THE WHOLE EVIDENCE WE HAVE FOR THE MORTALITY OF THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON NOT ONE IOTA IS ADDED TO THE PROOF BY INTERPOLATING A GENERAL PROPOSITION
4788-91208-0016 WE NOT ONLY MAY ACCORDING TO MISTER MILL REASON FROM SOME PARTICULAR INSTANCES TO OTHERS BUT WE FREQUENTLY DO SO AS HOWEVER THE INSTANCES WHICH ARE SUFFICIENT TO PROVE ONE FRESH INSTANCE
4788-91208-0017 THE WORK OF DEDUCTION IS THE INTERPRETATION OF THESE FORMULAS AND THEREFORE STRICTLY SPEAKING IS NOT INFERENTIAL AT ALL THE REAL INFERENCE WAS ACCOMPLISHED WHEN THE UNIVERSAL PROPOSITION WAS ARRIVED AT
4788-91208-0018 ALL REASONING IS SHOWN TO BE AT BOTTOM INDUCTIVE INDUCTIONS AND THEIR INTERPRETATION MAKE UP THE WHOLE OF LOGIC AND TO INDUCTION ACCORDINGLY MISTER MILL DEVOTED HIS CHIEF ATTENTION FOR THE FIRST TIME INDUCTION WAS TREATED AS THE OPUS MAGNUM OF LOGIC
4788-91208-0019 AND THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE TRACED TO THEIR INDUCTIVE ORIGIN IT WAS THIS TAKEN WITH HIS THEORY OF THE SYLLOGISM WHICH WORKED THE GREAT CHANGE BOTH HIS SYSTEM OF LOGIC AND HIS EXAMINATION OF SIR WILLIAM HAMILTON'S PHILOSOPHY
4788-91208-0020 ARE FOR THE MOST PART DEVOTED TO FORTIFYING THIS POSITION AND DEMOLISHING BELIEFS INCONSISTENT WITH IT AS A SYSTEMATIC PSYCHOLOGIST MISTER MILL HAS NOT DONE SO MUCH AS EITHER PROFESSOR BAIN OR MISTER HERBERT SPENCER
4788-91208-0021 THE PERFECTION OF HIS METHOD ITS APPLICATION AND THE UPROOTING OF PREJUDICES WHICH STOOD IN ITS WAY THIS WAS THE TASK TO WHICH MISTER MILL APPLIED HIMSELF WITH AN ABILITY AND SUCCESS RARELY MATCHED AND NEVER SURPASSED
4788-91208-0022 THE BIGGEST LION IN THE PATH WAS THE DOCTRINE OF SO CALLED NECESSARY TRUTH THIS DOCTRINE WAS ESPECIALLY OBNOXIOUS TO HIM AS IT SET UP A PURELY SUBJECTIVE STANDARD OF TRUTH AND A STANDARD AS HE WAS EASILY ABLE TO SHOW
4788-91208-0023 VARYING ACCORDING TO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE INDIVIDUAL SUCH THINKERS AS DOCTOR WHEWELL AND MISTER HERBERT SPENCER HAD TO BE MET IN INTELLECTUAL COMBAT DOCTOR WHEWELL HELD NOT THAT THE INCONCEIVABILITY
4788-91208-0024 OF THE CONTRADICTORY OF A PROPOSITION IS A PROOF OF ITS TRUTH CO EQUAL WITH EXPERIENCE BUT THAT ITS VALUE TRANSCENDS EXPERIENCE EXPERIENCE MAY TELL US WHAT IS BUT IT IS BY THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF CONCEIVING IT OTHERWISE
4788-91208-0025 IN HIS EXAMINATION OF SIR WILLIAM HAMILTON'S PHILOSOPHY MISTER MILL GIVES BATTLE TO THIS MODE OF THOUGHT AFTER REVIEWING IN AN OPENING CHAPTER THE VARIOUS VIEWS WHICH HAVE BEEN HELD RESPECTING THE RELATIVITY OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE
4788-91208-0026 AS MISTER MILL SAYS THE NAME OF GOD IS VEILED UNDER TWO EXTREMELY ABSTRACT PHRASES INFINITE AND THE ABSOLUTE SO PROFOUND AND FRIENDLY A THINKER AS THE LATE MISTER GROTE HELD THIS RAISING OF THE VEIL INEXPEDIENT BUT HE PROVED
4788-91208-0027 BY A MISTAKE HE FELL INTO THE NECESSITY OF LOOKING AT THE MATTER IN THE CONCRETE HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE FORCE OF MISTER MILL'S ARGUMENT THAT THE INFINITE MUST INCLUDE A FARRAGO OF CONTRADICTIONS
4788-91208-0028 IN WHICH THESE CONTRADICTORY ATTRIBUTES INHERE BUT IT WAS AGAINST A CORRESPONDING BEING THE INFINITE THAT MISTER MILL WAS ARGUING IT IS THIS THAT HE CALLS A
4788-91208-0029 AND REGARDED AS THE REDUCTIO AD ABSURDISSIMUM OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL PHILOSOPHY MISTER MILL'S RELIGIOUS TENDENCIES MAY VERY WELL BE GATHERED FROM A PASSAGE IN HIS REVIEW OF AUGUSTE COMTE A PHILOSOPHER WITH WHOM HE AGREED ON ALL POINTS
4788-91208-0030 AND PRESCRIBE TO HIM A RULE OF LIFE THAT PERSON HAS A RELIGION AND THOUGH EVERY ONE NATURALLY PREFERS HIS OWN RELIGION TO ANY OTHER ALL MUST ADMIT THAT IF THE OBJECT OF HIS ATTACHMENT AND OF THIS FEELING OF DUTY IS THE AGGREGATE OF OUR FELLOW CREATURES
4788-91208-0031 THIS RELIGION OF THE INFIDEL CANNOT IN HONESTY AND CONSCIENCE BE CALLED AN INTRINSICALLY BAD ONE MANY INDEED MAY BE UNABLE TO BELIEVE THAT THIS OBJECT IS CAPABLE OF GATHERING ROUND IT FEELINGS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG
4788-91208-0032 AND WE JOIN WITH HIM IN CONTEMNING AS EQUALLY IRRATIONAL AND MEAN THE CONCEPTION OF HUMAN NATURE AS INCAPABLE OF GIVING ITS LOVE AND DEVOTING ITS EXISTENCE TO ANY OBJECT WHICH CANNOT AFFORD IN EXCHANGE AN ETERNITY OF PERSONAL ENJOYMENT
4788-91208-0033 NEVER HAS THE LIBEL OF HUMANITY INVOLVED IN THE CURRENT THEOLOGY BEEN MORE FORCIBLY POINTED OUT WITH ITS CONSTANT APPEAL TO LOW MOTIVES OF PERSONAL GAIN
4788-91208-0034 AND ALL HIS RELATIONS TO HIS FELLOW CREATURES THE VERY BIRDS ABOUT HIS DWELLING SEEMED TO RECOGNIZE IT IT IS THIS NOBLE SENTIMENT WHICH INFUSES A SOUL OF LIFE INTO HIS TEACHINGS AND THE ENUNCIATION AND ACTING OUT OF WHICH CONSTITUTE HIM
4788-94904-0000 WE HAVE RECOGNIZED IN REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT THE IDEAL TYPE OF THE MOST PERFECT POLITY FOR WHICH IN CONSEQUENCE ANY PORTION OF MANKIND ARE BETTER ADAPTED IN PROPORTION TO THEIR DEGREE OF GENERAL IMPROVEMENT AS THEY RANGE LOWER AND LOWER IN DEVELOPMENT
4788-94904-0001 THAT FORM OF GOVERNMENT WILL BE GENERALLY SPEAKING LESS SUITABLE TO THEM THOUGH THIS IS NOT TRUE UNIVERSALLY FOR THE ADAPTATION OF A PEOPLE TO REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DEPEND SO MUCH UPON THE PLACE THEY OCCUPY IN THE GENERAL SCALE OF HUMANITY
4788-94904-0002 AS UPON THE DEGREE IN WHICH THEY POSSESS CERTAIN SPECIAL REQUISITES REQUISITES HOWEVER SO CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THEIR DEGREE OF GENERAL ADVANCEMENT THAT ANY VARIATION BETWEEN THE TWO IS RATHER THE EXCEPTION THAN THE RULE
4788-94904-0003 THAT THEY SHOULD BE WILLING AND ABLE TO FULFILL THE DUTIES AND DISCHARGE THE FUNCTIONS WHICH IT IMPOSES ON THEM THE WILLINGNESS OF THE PEOPLE TO ACCEPT REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT ONLY BECOMES A PRACTICAL QUESTION WHEN AN ENLIGHTENED RULER OR A FOREIGN NATION OR NATIONS
4788-94904-0004 WHO HAVE GAINED POWER OVER THE COUNTRY ARE DISPOSED TO OFFER IT THE BOON TO INDIVIDUAL REFORMERS THE QUESTION IS ALMOST IRRELEVANT SINCE IF NO OTHER OBJECTION CAN BE MADE TO THEIR ENTERPRISE THAN THAT THE OPINION OF THE NATION IS NOT YET ON THEIR SIDE
4788-94904-0005 THEY HAVE THE READY AND PROPER ANSWER THAT TO BRING IT OVER TO THEIR SIDE IS THE VERY END THEY AIM AT WHEN OPINION IS REALLY ADVERSE ITS HOSTILITY IS USUALLY TO THE FACT OF CHANGE RATHER THAN TO REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IN ITSELF
4788-94904-0006 THE CONTRARY CASE IS NOT INDEED UNEXAMPLED THERE HAS SOMETIMES BEEN A RELIGIOUS REPUGNANCE TO ANY LIMITATION OF THE POWER OF A PARTICULAR LINE OF RULERS BUT IN GENERAL THE DOCTRINE OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE MEANT ONLY SUBMISSION TO THE WILL OF THE POWERS THAT BE
4788-94904-0007 WHETHER MONARCHICAL OR POPULAR IN ANY CASE IN WHICH THE ATTEMPT TO INTRODUCE REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IS AT ALL LIKELY TO BE MADE INDIFFERENCE TO IT
4788-94904-0008 RATHER THAN POSITIVE OPPOSITION ARE THE OBSTACLES TO BE EXPECTED THESE HOWEVER ARE AS FATAL AND MAY BE AS HARD TO BE GOT RID OF AS ACTUAL AVERSION IT BEING EASIER IN MOST CASES TO CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF AN ACTIVE FEELING THAN TO CREATE ONE
4788-94904-0009 IN A STATE PREVIOUSLY PASSIVE WHEN A PEOPLE HAVE NO SUFFICIENT VALUE FOR AND ATTACHMENT TO A REPRESENTATIVE CONSTITUTION THEY HAVE NEXT TO NO CHANCE OF RETAINING IT
4788-94904-0010 AND IS IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE PUBLIC TO IT PRINCIPALLY THE HOPES AND FEARS OF INDIVIDUALS ARE DIRECTED AND BY IT BOTH THE BENEFITS AND THE TERRORS AND PRESTIGE OF GOVERNMENT ARE MAINLY REPRESENTED TO THE PUBLIC EYE
4788-94904-0011 UNLESS THEREFORE THE AUTHORITIES WHOSE OFFICE IT IS TO CHECK THE EXECUTIVE ARE BACKED BY AN EFFECTIVE OPINION AND FEELING IN THE COUNTRY THE EXECUTIVE HAS ALWAYS THE MEANS OF SETTING THEM ASIDE OR COMPELLING THEM TO SUBSERVIENCE
4788-94904-0012 AND IS SURE TO BE WELL SUPPORTED IN DOING SO REPRESENTATIVE INSTITUTIONS NECESSARILY DEPEND FOR PERMANENCE UPON THE READINESS OF THE PEOPLE TO FIGHT FOR THEM IN CASE OF THEIR BEING ENDANGERED IF TOO LITTLE VALUED FOR THIS
4788-94904-0013 THEY SELDOM OBTAIN A FOOTING AT ALL AND IF THEY DO ARE ALMOST SURE TO BE OVERTHROWN AS SOON AS THE HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT OR ANY PARTY LEADER WHO CAN MUSTER FORCE FOR A COUP DE MAIN IS WILLING TO RUN SOME SMALL RISK FOR ABSOLUTE POWER
4788-94904-0014 THESE CONSIDERATIONS RELATE TO THE FIRST TWO CAUSES OF FAILURE IN A REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT THE THIRD IS WHEN THE PEOPLE WANT EITHER THE WILL OR THE CAPACITY TO FULFILL THE PART WHICH BELONGS TO THEM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CONSTITUTION
4788-94904-0015 WHEN NOBODY OR ONLY SOME SMALL FRACTION FEELS THE DEGREE OF INTEREST IN THE GENERAL AFFAIRS OF THE STATE NECESSARY TO THE FORMATION OF A PUBLIC OPINION THE ELECTORS WILL SELDOM MAKE ANY USE OF THE RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE BUT TO SERVE THEIR PRIVATE INTEREST OR THE INTEREST OF THEIR LOCALITY
4788-94904-0016 OR OF SOME ONE WITH WHOM THEY ARE CONNECTED AS ADHERENTS OR DEPENDENTS THE SMALL CLASS WHO IN THIS STATE OF PUBLIC FEELING GAIN THE COMMAND OF THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY FOR THE MOST PART USE IT SOLELY AS A MEANS OF SEEKING THEIR FORTUNE IF THE EXECUTIVE IS WEAK
4788-94904-0017 THE COUNTRY IS DISTRACTED BY MERE STRUGGLES FOR PLACE IF STRONG IT MAKES ITSELF DESPOTIC AT THE CHEAP PRICE OF APPEASING THE REPRESENTATIVES OR SUCH OF THEM AS ARE CAPABLE OF GIVING TROUBLE BY A SHARE OF THE SPOIL
4788-94904-0018 AND THE ONLY FRUIT PRODUCED BY NATIONAL REPRESENTATION IS THAT IN ADDITION TO THOSE WHO REALLY GOVERN THERE IS AN ASSEMBLY QUARTERED ON THE PUBLIC AND NO ABUSE IN WHICH A PORTION OF THE ASSEMBLY ARE INTERESTED IS AT ALL LIKELY TO BE REMOVED
4788-94904-0019 WHEN HOWEVER THE EVIL STOPS HERE THE PRICE MAY BE WORTH PAYING FOR THE PUBLICITY AND DISCUSSION WHICH THOUGH NOT AN INVARIABLE ARE A NATURAL ACCOMPANIMENT OF ANY EVEN NOMINAL REPRESENTATION
4788-94904-0020 THAT THE PLACE HUNTERS WHO CHIEFLY COMPOSE THE REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY THOUGH THEY CONTRIBUTE LITTLE OR NOTHING DIRECTLY TO GOOD GOVERNMENT NOR EVEN MUCH TEMPER THE ARBITRARY POWER OF THE EXECUTIVE
4788-94904-0021 WHICH EXISTS IN THAT COUNTRY THIS BENEFIT HOWEVER IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON THE COEXISTENCE WITH THE POPULAR BODY OF AN HEREDITARY KING IF INSTEAD OF STRUGGLING FOR THE FAVORS OF THE CHIEF RULER THESE SELFISH AND SORDID FACTIONS STRUGGLED FOR THE CHIEF PLACE ITSELF
4788-94904-0022 THEY WOULD CERTAINLY AS IN SPANISH AMERICA KEEP THE COUNTRY IN A STATE OF CHRONIC REVOLUTION AND CIVIL WAR A DESPOTISM NOT EVEN LEGAL BUT OF ILLEGAL VIOLENCE WOULD BE ALTERNATELY EXERCISED BY A SUCCESSION OF POLITICAL ADVENTURERS
4788-94904-0023 AND THE NAME AND FORMS OF REPRESENTATION WOULD HAVE NO EFFECT BUT TO PREVENT DESPOTISM FROM ATTAINING THE STABILITY AND SECURITY BY WHICH ALONE ITS EVILS CAN BE MITIGATED OR ITS FEW ADVANTAGES REALIZED
4788-94904-0024 THERE ARE OTHERS IN WHICH IT POSSIBLY MIGHT EXIST BUT IN WHICH SOME OTHER FORM OF GOVERNMENT WOULD BE PREFERABLE THESE ARE PRINCIPALLY WHEN THE PEOPLE IN ORDER TO ADVANCE IN CIVILIZATION HAVE SOME LESSON TO LEARN SOME HABIT NOT YET ACQUIRED
4788-94904-0025 TO THE ACQUISITION OF WHICH REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IS LIKELY TO BE AN IMPEDIMENT THE MOST OBVIOUS OF THESE CASES IS THE ONE ALREADY CONSIDERED IN WHICH THE PEOPLE HAVE STILL TO LEARN THE FIRST LESSON OF CIVILIZATION THAT OF OBEDIENCE
4788-94904-0026 A RACE WHO HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN ENERGY AND COURAGE BY STRUGGLES WITH NATURE AND THEIR NEIGHBORS BUT WHO HAVE NOT YET SETTLED DOWN INTO PERMANENT OBEDIENCE TO ANY COMMON SUPERIOR WOULD BE LITTLE LIKELY TO ACQUIRE THIS HABIT UNDER THE COLLECTIVE GOVERNMENT OF THEIR OWN BODY
4788-94904-0027 A REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY DRAWN FROM AMONG THEMSELVES WOULD SIMPLY REFLECT THEIR OWN TURBULENT INSUBORDINATION IT WOULD REFUSE ITS AUTHORITY TO ALL PROCEEDINGS WHICH WOULD IMPOSE ON THEIR SAVAGE INDEPENDENCE ANY IMPROVING RESTRAINT
4788-94904-0028 A MILITARY LEADER IS THE ONLY SUPERIOR TO WHOM THEY WILL SUBMIT EXCEPT OCCASIONALLY SOME PROPHET SUPPOSED TO BE INSPIRED FROM ABOVE OR CONJURER REGARDED AS POSSESSING MIRACULOUS POWER THESE MAY EXERCISE A TEMPORARY ASCENDANCY
4788-94904-0029 BUT AS IT IS MERELY PERSONAL IT RARELY EFFECTS ANY CHANGE IN THE GENERAL HABITS OF THE PEOPLE UNLESS THE PROPHET LIKE MOHAMMED IS ALSO A MILITARY CHIEF AND GOES FORTH THE ARMED APOSTLE OF A NEW RELIGION
4788-94904-0030 OR UNLESS THE MILITARY CHIEFS ALLY THEMSELVES WITH HIS INFLUENCE AND TURN IT INTO A PROP FOR THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT A PEOPLE ARE NO LESS UNFITTED FOR REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT BY THE CONTRARY FAULT TO THAT LAST SPECIFIED BY EXTREME PASSIVENESS
4788-94904-0031 AND READY SUBMISSION TO TYRANNY IF A PEOPLE THUS PROSTRATED BY CHARACTER AND CIRCUMSTANCES COULD OBTAIN REPRESENTATIVE INSTITUTIONS THEY WOULD INEVITABLY CHOOSE THEIR TYRANTS AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AND THE YOKE WOULD BE MADE HEAVIER ON THEM BY THE CONTRIVANCE WHICH
4788-94904-0032 MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO LIGHTEN IT ON THE CONTRARY MANY A PEOPLE HAS GRADUALLY EMERGED FROM THIS CONDITION BY THE AID OF A CENTRAL AUTHORITY WHOSE POSITION HAS MADE IT THE RIVAL AND HAS ENDED BY MAKING IT THE MASTER OF THE LOCAL DESPOTS
4788-94904-0033 EVEN WHEN THE KING WAS SCARCELY SO POWERFUL AS MANY OF HIS CHIEF FEUDATORIES THE GREAT ADVANTAGE WHICH HE DERIVED FROM BEING BUT ONE HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY FRENCH HISTORIANS TO HIM THE EYES OF ALL THE LOCALLY OPPRESSED WERE TURNED
4788-94904-0034 HE WAS THE OBJECT OF HOPE AND RELIANCE THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM WHILE EACH LOCAL POTENTATE WAS ONLY POWERFUL WITHIN A MORE OR LESS CONFINED SPACE AT HIS HANDS REFUGE AND PROTECTION WERE SOUGHT FROM EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY AGAINST FIRST ONE
4788-94904-0035 THEN ANOTHER OF THE IMMEDIATE OPPRESSORS HIS PROGRESS TO ASCENDANCY WAS SLOW BUT IT RESULTED FROM SUCCESSIVELY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OPPORTUNITIES WHICH OFFERED THEMSELVES ONLY TO HIM IT WAS THEREFORE SURE AND IN PROPORTION AS IT WAS ACCOMPLISHED
4788-94904-0036 IT ABATED IN THE OPPRESSED PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY THE HABIT OF SUBMITTING TO OPPRESSION THE KING'S INTEREST LAY IN ENCOURAGING ALL PARTIAL ATTEMPTS ON THE PART OF THE SERFS TO EMANCIPATE THEMSELVES FROM THEIR MASTERS AND PLACE THEMSELVES IN IMMEDIATE SUBORDINATION TO HIMSELF
4788-94904-0037 UNDER HIS PROTECTION NUMEROUS COMMUNITIES WERE FORMED WHICH KNEW NO ONE ABOVE THEM BUT THE KING
4788-94904-0038 AND THE MONARCH WAS LONG COMPELLED BY NECESSITIES OF POSITION TO EXERT HIS AUTHORITY AS THE ALLY RATHER THAN THE MASTER OF THE CLASSES WHOM HE HAD AIDED IN AFFECTING THEIR LIBERATION IN THIS MANNER A CENTRAL POWER DESPOTIC IN PRINCIPLE
4788-94904-0039 THOUGH GENERALLY MUCH RESTRICTED IN PRACTICE WAS MAINLY INSTRUMENTAL IN CARRYING THE PEOPLE THROUGH A NECESSARY STAGE OF IMPROVEMENT WHICH REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IF REAL WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE PREVENTED THEM FROM ENTERING UPON
481-123719-0000 IT WAS FOLLOWED BY REMORSE I TRIED TO DRIVE IT AWAY I FELT TOO SICK
481-123719-0001 I GREW USED TO EVERYTHING OR RATHER I VOLUNTARILY RESIGNED MYSELF TO ENDURING IT BUT I HAD A MEANS OF ESCAPE THAT RECONCILED EVERYTHING THAT WAS TO FIND REFUGE IN THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL IN DREAMS OF COURSE
481-123719-0002 I WAS A TERRIBLE DREAMER I WOULD DREAM FOR THREE MONTHS ON END TUCKED AWAY IN MY CORNER AND YOU MAY BELIEVE ME THAT AT THOSE MOMENTS I HAD NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IN THE PERTURBATION OF HIS CHICKEN HEART
481-123719-0003 PUT A COLLAR OF GERMAN BEAVER ON HIS GREAT COAT I SUDDENLY BECAME A HERO I WOULD NOT HAVE ADMITTED MY SIX FOOT LIEUTENANT EVEN IF HE HAD CALLED ON ME
481-123719-0004 BEFORE ME THEN WHAT WERE MY DREAMS
481-123719-0005 THOUGH INDEED EVEN NOW I AM TO SOME EXTENT SATISFIED WITH THEM DREAMS WERE PARTICULARLY SWEET AND VIVID AFTER A SPELL OF DISSIPATION
481-123719-0006 THERE WERE MOMENTS OF SUCH POSITIVE INTOXICATION OF SUCH HAPPINESS THAT THERE WAS NOT THE FAINTEST TRACE OF IRONY WITHIN ME ON MY HONOUR I HAD FAITH HOPE LOVE I BELIEVED BLINDLY AT SUCH TIMES THAT BY SOME MIRACLE
481-123719-0007 BY SOME EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCE ALL THIS WOULD SUDDENLY OPEN OUT EXPAND THAT SUDDENLY A VISTA OF SUITABLE ACTIVITY BENEFICENT GOOD AND ABOVE ALL READY MADE WHAT SORT OF ACTIVITY I HAD NO IDEA
481-123719-0008 BUT THE GREAT THING WAS THAT IT SHOULD BE ALL READY FOR ME WOULD RISE UP BEFORE ME AND I SHOULD COME OUT INTO THE LIGHT OF DAY ALMOST RIDING A WHITE HORSE AND CROWNED WITH LAUREL ANYTHING BUT THE FOREMOST PLACE I COULD NOT CONCEIVE FOR MYSELF
481-123719-0009 AND FOR THAT VERY REASON I QUITE CONTENTEDLY OCCUPIED THE LOWEST IN REALITY EITHER TO BE A HERO OR TO GROVEL IN THE MUD THERE WAS NOTHING BETWEEN
481-123719-0010 THAT WAS MY RUIN FOR WHEN I WAS IN THE MUD I COMFORTED MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT AT OTHER TIMES I WAS A HERO AND THE HERO WAS A CLOAK FOR THE MUD
481-123719-0011 IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THESE ATTACKS OF THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL VISITED ME EVEN DURING THE PERIOD OF DISSIPATION AND JUST AT THE TIMES WHEN I WAS TOUCHING THE BOTTOM THEY CAME IN SEPARATE SPURTS AS THOUGH REMINDING ME OF THEMSELVES
481-123719-0012 BUT DID NOT BANISH THE DISSIPATION BY THEIR APPEARANCE ON THE CONTRARY
481-123719-0013 AND WERE ONLY SUFFICIENTLY PRESENT TO SERVE AS AN APPETISING SAUCE THAT SAUCE WAS MADE UP OF CONTRADICTIONS AND SUFFERINGS OF AGONISING INWARD ANALYSIS AND ALL THESE PANGS AND PIN PRICKS GAVE A CERTAIN PIQUANCY
481-123719-0014 EVEN A SIGNIFICANCE TO MY DISSIPATION IN FACT COMPLETELY ANSWERED THE PURPOSE OF AN APPETISING SAUCE THERE WAS A CERTAIN DEPTH OF MEANING IN IT AND I COULD HARDLY HAVE RESIGNED MYSELF TO THE SIMPLE VULGAR DIRECT DEBAUCHERY OF A CLERK
481-123719-0015 AND HAVE ENDURED ALL THE FILTHINESS OF IT
481-123719-0016 INTO THE STREET NO I HAD A LOFTY WAY OF GETTING OUT OF IT ALL
481-123719-0017 IN THOSE FLIGHTS INTO THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL THOUGH IT WAS FANTASTIC LOVE THOUGH IT WAS NEVER APPLIED TO ANYTHING HUMAN IN REALITY YET THERE WAS SO MUCH OF THIS LOVE THAT ONE DID NOT FEEL AFTERWARDS EVEN THE IMPULSE TO APPLY IT IN REALITY
481-123719-0018 EVERYTHING HOWEVER PASSED SATISFACTORILY BY A LAZY AND FASCINATING TRANSITION INTO THE SPHERE OF ART THAT IS INTO THE BEAUTIFUL FORMS OF LIFE LYING READY
481-123719-0019 I CAME IN FOR COUNTLESS MILLIONS AND IMMEDIATELY DEVOTED THEM TO HUMANITY AND AT THE SAME TIME I CONFESSED BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE MY SHAMEFUL DEEDS WHICH OF COURSE WERE NOT MERELY SHAMEFUL BUT HAD IN THEM
481-123719-0020 MUCH THAT WAS SUBLIME AND BEAUTIFUL SOMETHING IN THE MANFRED STYLE EVERYONE WOULD KISS ME AND WEEP
481-123719-0021 AUSTERLITZ AGAINST THE OBSCURANTISTS THEN THE BAND WOULD PLAY A MARCH AN AMNESTY WOULD BE DECLARED THE POPE WOULD AGREE TO RETIRE FROM ROME TO BRAZIL
481-123719-0022 LAKE COMO BEING FOR THAT PURPOSE TRANSFERRED TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF ROME THEN WOULD COME A SCENE IN THE BUSHES AND SO ON AND SO ON AS THOUGH YOU DID NOT KNOW ALL ABOUT IT YOU WILL SAY THAT IT IS VULGAR AND CONTEMPTIBLE TO DRAG ALL THIS INTO PUBLIC
481-123719-0023 BUT WHY IS IT CONTEMPTIBLE CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT I AM ASHAMED OF IT ALL AND THAT IT WAS STUPIDER THAN ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE GENTLEMEN AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT SOME OF THESE FANCIES WERE BY NO MEANS BADLY COMPOSED
481-123719-0024 AND YET YOU ARE RIGHT IT REALLY IS VULGAR AND CONTEMPTIBLE
481-123719-0025 AND EVEN MORE CONTEMPTIBLE THAN THAT IS MY MAKING THIS REMARK NOW BUT THAT'S ENOUGH
481-123719-0026 I COULD NEVER STAND MORE THAN THREE MONTHS OF DREAMING AT A TIME WITHOUT FEELING AN IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE TO PLUNGE INTO SOCIETY TO PLUNGE INTO SOCIETY MEANT
481-123719-0027 TO VISIT MY SUPERIOR AT THE OFFICE ANTON ANTONITCH SYETOTCHKIN HE WAS THE ONLY PERMANENT ACQUAINTANCE I HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE
481-123719-0028 THAT IT BECAME ESSENTIAL AT ONCE TO EMBRACE MY FELLOWS AND ALL MANKIND AND FOR THAT PURPOSE I NEEDED AT LEAST ONE HUMAN BEING ACTUALLY EXISTING I HAD TO CALL ON ANTON ANTONITCH HOWEVER ON TUESDAY
481-123719-0029 HIS AT HOME DAY SO I HAD ALWAYS TO TIME MY PASSIONATE DESIRE TO EMBRACE HUMANITY SO THAT IT MIGHT FALL ON A TUESDAY THIS ANTON ANTONITCH LIVED ON THE FOURTH STOREY IN A HOUSE IN FIVE CORNERS IN FOUR LOW PITCHED ROOMS
481-123719-0030 ONE SMALLER THAN THE OTHER OF A PARTICULARLY FRUGAL AND SALLOW APPEARANCE HE HAD TWO DAUGHTERS AND THEIR AUNT WHO USED TO POUR OUT THE TEA OF THE DAUGHTERS ONE WAS THIRTEEN AND ANOTHER FOURTEEN
481-123719-0031 THEY BOTH HAD SNUB NOSES AND I WAS AWFULLY SHY OF THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE ALWAYS WHISPERING AND GIGGLING TOGETHER THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE USUALLY SAT IN HIS STUDY ON A LEATHER COUCH IN FRONT OF THE TABLE WITH SOME GREY HEADED GENTLEMAN
481-123719-0032 USUALLY A COLLEAGUE FROM OUR OFFICE OR SOME OTHER DEPARTMENT I NEVER SAW MORE THAN TWO OR THREE VISITORS THERE ALWAYS THE SAME THEY TALKED ABOUT THE EXCISE DUTY
481-123719-0033 AND THE BEST MEANS OF PLEASING HIM AND SO ON I HAD THE PATIENCE TO SIT LIKE A FOOL BESIDE THESE PEOPLE
481-123719-0034 LISTENING TO THEM WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT TO SAY TO THEM OR VENTURING TO SAY A WORD I BECAME STUPEFIED SEVERAL TIMES I FELT MYSELF PERSPIRING I WAS OVERCOME BY A SORT OF PARALYSIS BUT THIS WAS PLEASANT AND GOOD FOR ME
481-123719-0035 ON RETURNING HOME I DEFERRED FOR A TIME MY DESIRE TO EMBRACE ALL MANKIND I HAD HOWEVER ONE OTHER ACQUAINTANCE OF A SORT SIMONOV WHO WAS AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW I HAD A NUMBER OF SCHOOLFELLOWS INDEED IN PETERSBURG
481-123719-0036 BUT I DID NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THEM AND HAD EVEN GIVEN UP NODDING TO THEM IN THE STREET I BELIEVE I HAD TRANSFERRED INTO THE DEPARTMENT I WAS IN SIMPLY TO AVOID THEIR COMPANY AND TO CUT OFF ALL CONNECTION WITH MY HATEFUL CHILDHOOD
481-123719-0037 CURSES ON THAT SCHOOL AND ALL THOSE TERRIBLE YEARS OF PENAL SERVITUDE IN SHORT I PARTED FROM MY SCHOOLFELLOWS AS SOON AS I GOT OUT INTO THE WORLD THERE WERE TWO OR THREE LEFT TO WHOM I NODDED IN THE STREET ONE OF THEM WAS SIMONOV
481-123719-0038 WHO HAD IN NO WAY BEEN DISTINGUISHED AT SCHOOL WAS OF A QUIET AND EQUABLE DISPOSITION BUT I DISCOVERED IN HIM A CERTAIN INDEPENDENCE OF CHARACTER AND EVEN HONESTY I DON'T EVEN SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS PARTICULARLY STUPID
481-123719-0039 BUT THESE HAD NOT LASTED LONG AND HAD SOMEHOW BEEN SUDDENLY CLOUDED OVER HE WAS EVIDENTLY UNCOMFORTABLE AT THESE REMINISCENCES AND WAS I FANCY ALWAYS AFRAID THAT I MIGHT TAKE UP THE SAME TONE AGAIN
481-123719-0040 NOT BEING QUITE CERTAIN OF IT
481-123719-0041 BUT AS IT ALWAYS HAPPENED THAT SUCH REFLECTIONS IMPELLED ME AS THOUGH PURPOSELY TO PUT MYSELF INTO A FALSE POSITION I WENT IN
481-123720-0000 ALL OF THEM TOOK SCARCELY ANY NOTICE OF MY ENTRANCE WHICH WAS STRANGE FOR I HAD NOT MET THEM FOR YEARS EVIDENTLY THEY LOOKED UPON ME AS SOMETHING ON THE LEVEL OF A COMMON FLY I HAD NOT BEEN TREATED LIKE THAT EVEN AT SCHOOL THOUGH THEY ALL HATED ME
481-123720-0001 I KNEW OF COURSE THAT THEY MUST DESPISE ME NOW FOR MY LACK OF SUCCESS IN THE SERVICE AND FOR MY HAVING LET MYSELF SINK SO LOW GOING ABOUT BADLY DRESSED AND SO ON WHICH SEEMED TO THEM A SIGN OF MY INCAPACITY AND INSIGNIFICANCE
481-123720-0002 BUT I HAD NOT EXPECTED SUCH CONTEMPT SIMONOV WAS POSITIVELY SURPRISED AT MY TURNING UP
481-123720-0003 ALL THIS DISCONCERTED ME I SAT DOWN FEELING RATHER MISERABLE AND BEGAN LISTENING TO WHAT THEY WERE SAYING THEY WERE ENGAGED IN WARM AND EARNEST CONVERSATION ABOUT A FAREWELL DINNER WHICH THEY WANTED TO ARRANGE FOR THE NEXT DAY TO A COMRADE OF THEIRS CALLED ZVERKOV
481-123720-0004 THIS ZVERKOV HAD BEEN ALL THE TIME AT SCHOOL WITH ME TOO I HAD BEGUN TO HATE HIM PARTICULARLY IN THE UPPER FORMS IN THE LOWER FORMS HE HAD SIMPLY BEEN A PRETTY PLAYFUL BOY WHOM EVERYBODY LIKED I HAD HATED HIM HOWEVER EVEN IN THE LOWER FORMS
481-123720-0005 JUST BECAUSE HE WAS A PRETTY AND PLAYFUL BOY HE WAS ALWAYS BAD AT HIS LESSONS AND GOT WORSE AND WORSE AS HE WENT ON HOWEVER HE LEFT WITH A GOOD CERTIFICATE AS HE HAD POWERFUL INTERESTS DURING HIS LAST YEAR AT SCHOOL HE CAME IN FOR AN ESTATE OF TWO HUNDRED SERFS
481-123720-0006 AND AS ALMOST ALL OF US WERE POOR HE TOOK UP A SWAGGERING TONE AMONG US HE WAS VULGAR IN THE EXTREME BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS A GOOD NATURED FELLOW EVEN IN HIS SWAGGERING
481-123720-0007 IN SPITE OF SUPERFICIAL FANTASTIC AND SHAM NOTIONS OF HONOUR AND DIGNITY ALL BUT VERY FEW OF US POSITIVELY GROVELLED BEFORE ZVERKOV AND THE MORE SO THE MORE HE SWAGGERED AND IT WAS NOT FROM ANY INTERESTED MOTIVE
481-123720-0008 BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN FAVOURED BY THE GIFTS OF NATURE MOREOVER IT WAS AS IT WERE AN ACCEPTED IDEA AMONG US THAT ZVERKOV WAS A SPECIALIST IN REGARD TO TACT AND THE SOCIAL GRACES THIS LAST FACT PARTICULARLY INFURIATED ME
481-123720-0009 I HATED THE ABRUPT SELF CONFIDENT TONE OF HIS VOICE HIS ADMIRATION OF HIS OWN WITTICISMS
481-123720-0010 THOUGH HE WAS BOLD IN HIS LANGUAGE I HATED HIS HANDSOME BUT STUPID FACE FOR WHICH I WOULD HOWEVER HAVE GLADLY EXCHANGED MY INTELLIGENT ONE AND THE FREE AND EASY MILITARY MANNERS IN FASHION IN THE FORTIES
481-123720-0011 I HATED THE WAY IN WHICH HE USED TO TALK OF HIS FUTURE CONQUESTS OF WOMEN HE DID NOT VENTURE TO BEGIN HIS ATTACK UPON WOMEN UNTIL HE HAD THE EPAULETTES OF AN OFFICER AND WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THEM WITH IMPATIENCE AND BOASTED OF THE DUELS HE WOULD CONSTANTLY BE FIGHTING
481-123720-0012 I REMEMBER HOW I INVARIABLY SO TACITURN SUDDENLY FASTENED UPON ZVERKOV WHEN ONE DAY TALKING AT A LEISURE MOMENT WITH HIS SCHOOLFELLOWS OF HIS FUTURE RELATIONS WITH THE FAIR SEX AND GROWING AS SPORTIVE AS A PUPPY IN THE SUN
481-123720-0013 HE ALL AT ONCE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD NOT LEAVE A SINGLE VILLAGE GIRL ON HIS ESTATE UNNOTICED
481-123720-0014 AND THAT IF THE PEASANTS DARED TO PROTEST HE WOULD HAVE THEM ALL FLOGGED AND DOUBLE THE TAX ON THEM THE BEARDED RASCALS OUR SERVILE RABBLE APPLAUDED BUT I ATTACKED HIM NOT FROM COMPASSION FOR THE GIRLS AND THEIR FATHERS
481-123720-0015 BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE APPLAUDING SUCH AN INSECT I GOT THE BETTER OF HIM ON THAT OCCASION BUT THOUGH ZVERKOV WAS STUPID HE WAS LIVELY AND IMPUDENT AND SO LAUGHED IT OFF AND IN SUCH A WAY THAT MY VICTORY WAS NOT REALLY COMPLETE
481-123720-0016 THE LAUGH WAS ON HIS SIDE HE GOT THE BETTER OF ME ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AFTERWARDS BUT WITHOUT MALICE JESTINGLY CASUALLY I REMAINED ANGRILY AND CONTEMPTUOUSLY SILENT AND WOULD NOT ANSWER HIM WHEN WE LEFT SCHOOL HE MADE ADVANCES TO ME
481-123720-0017 I DID NOT REBUFF THEM FOR I WAS FLATTERED BUT WE SOON PARTED AND QUITE NATURALLY AFTERWARDS I HEARD OF HIS BARRACK ROOM SUCCESS AS A LIEUTENANT AND OF THE FAST LIFE HE WAS LEADING THEN THERE CAME OTHER RUMOURS
481-123720-0018 BY THEN HE HAD TAKEN TO CUTTING ME IN THE STREET AND I SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF COMPROMISING HIMSELF BY GREETING A PERSONAGE AS INSIGNIFICANT AS ME I SAW HIM ONCE IN THE THEATRE IN THE THIRD TIER OF BOXES
481-123720-0019 BY THEN HE WAS WEARING SHOULDER STRAPS HE WAS TWISTING AND TWIRLING ABOUT INGRATIATING HIMSELF WITH THE DAUGHTERS OF AN ANCIENT GENERAL IN THREE YEARS HE HAD GONE OFF CONSIDERABLY THOUGH HE WAS STILL RATHER HANDSOME AND ADROIT
481-123720-0020 ONE COULD SEE THAT BY THE TIME HE WAS THIRTY HE WOULD BE CORPULENT
481-123720-0021 THEY HAD KEPT UP WITH HIM FOR THOSE THREE YEARS THOUGH PRIVATELY THEY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES ON AN EQUAL FOOTING WITH HIM I AM CONVINCED OF THAT OF SIMONOV'S TWO VISITORS ONE WAS FERFITCHKIN A RUSSIANISED GERMAN
481-123720-0022 A LITTLE FELLOW WITH THE FACE OF A MONKEY A BLOCKHEAD WHO WAS ALWAYS DERIDING EVERYONE A VERY BITTER ENEMY OF MINE FROM OUR DAYS IN THE LOWER FORMS A VULGAR IMPUDENT SWAGGERING FELLOW WHO AFFECTED A MOST SENSITIVE FEELING
481-123720-0023 OF PERSONAL HONOUR THOUGH OF COURSE HE WAS A WRETCHED LITTLE COWARD AT HEART HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WORSHIPPERS OF ZVERKOV WHO MADE UP TO THE LATTER FROM INTERESTED MOTIVES AND OFTEN BORROWED MONEY FROM HIM SIMONOV'S OTHER VISITOR TRUDOLYUBOV WAS A PERSON IN NO WAY REMARKABLE
481-123720-0024 A TALL YOUNG FELLOW IN THE ARMY WITH A COLD FACE FAIRLY HONEST THOUGH HE WORSHIPPED SUCCESS OF EVERY SORT AND WAS ONLY CAPABLE OF THINKING OF PROMOTION HE WAS SOME SORT OF DISTANT RELATION OF ZVERKOV'S AND THIS
481-123720-0025 GAVE HIM A CERTAIN IMPORTANCE AMONG US HE ALWAYS THOUGHT ME OF NO CONSEQUENCE WHATEVER HIS BEHAVIOUR TO ME THOUGH NOT QUITE COURTEOUS WAS TOLERABLE WELL WITH SEVEN ROUBLES EACH SAID TRUDOLYUBOV TWENTY ONE ROUBLES BETWEEN THE THREE OF US
481-123720-0026 WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET A GOOD DINNER ZVERKOV OF COURSE WON'T PAY OF COURSE NOT SINCE WE ARE INVITING HIM SIMONOV DECIDED CAN YOU IMAGINE FERFITCHKIN INTERRUPTED HOTLY AND CONCEITEDLY
481-123720-0027 LIKE SOME INSOLENT FLUNKEY BOASTING OF HIS MASTER THE GENERAL'S DECORATIONS CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT ZVERKOV WILL LET US PAY ALONE HE WILL ACCEPT FROM DELICACY
481-123720-0028 SO THE THREE OF US WITH ZVERKOV FOR THE FOURTH
481-123720-0029 SIMONOV WHO HAD BEEN ASKED TO MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS CONCLUDED FINALLY HOW TWENTY ONE ROUBLES I ASKED IN SOME AGITATION WITH A SHOW OF BEING OFFENDED
481-123720-0030 TWENTY EIGHT ROUBLES IT SEEMED TO ME THAT TO INVITE MYSELF SO SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY WOULD BE POSITIVELY GRACEFUL AND THAT THEY WOULD ALL BE CONQUERED AT ONCE
481-123720-0031 DO YOU WANT TO JOIN TOO SIMONOV OBSERVED WITH NO APPEARANCE OF PLEASURE SEEMING TO AVOID LOOKING AT ME HE KNEW ME THROUGH AND THROUGH IT INFURIATED ME THAT HE KNEW ME SO THOROUGHLY WHY NOT
481-123720-0032 I AM AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW OF HIS TOO I BELIEVE AND I MUST OWN I FEEL HURT THAT YOU HAVE LEFT ME OUT I SAID BOILING OVER AGAIN AND WHERE WERE WE TO FIND YOU FERFITCHKIN PUT IN ROUGHLY YOU NEVER WERE ON GOOD TERMS WITH ZVERKOV TRUDOLYUBOV ADDED FROWNING
481-123720-0033 BUT I HAD ALREADY CLUTCHED AT THE IDEA AND WOULD NOT GIVE IT UP IT SEEMS TO ME THAT NO ONE HAS A RIGHT TO FORM AN OPINION UPON THAT I RETORTED IN A SHAKING VOICE AS THOUGH SOMETHING TREMENDOUS HAD HAPPENED PERHAPS THAT IS JUST MY REASON FOR WISHING IT NOW
481-123720-0034 THAT I HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN ON GOOD TERMS WITH HIM OH THERE'S NO MAKING YOU OUT WITH THESE REFINEMENTS TRUDOLYUBOV JEERED WE'LL PUT YOUR NAME DOWN SIMONOV DECIDED ADDRESSING ME
481-123720-0035 WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY FERFITCHKIN BEGAN IN AN UNDERTONE INDICATING ME TO SIMONOV BUT HE BROKE OFF FOR EVEN SIMONOV WAS EMBARRASSED THAT WILL DO SAID TRUDOLYUBOV GETTING UP IF HE WANTS TO COME SO MUCH LET HIM
481-123720-0036 BUT IT'S A PRIVATE THING BETWEEN US FRIENDS FERFITCHKIN SAID CROSSLY AS HE TOO PICKED UP HIS HAT IT'S NOT AN OFFICIAL GATHERING WE DO NOT WANT AT ALL PERHAPS THEY WENT AWAY FERFITCHKIN DID NOT GREET ME IN ANY WAY AS HE WENT OUT
481-123720-0037 TRUDOLYUBOV BARELY NODDED SIMONOV WITH WHOM I WAS LEFT TETE A TETE WAS IN A STATE OF VEXATION AND PERPLEXITY AND LOOKED AT ME QUEERLY
481-123720-0038 WILL YOU PAY YOUR SUBSCRIPTION NOW I JUST ASK SO AS TO KNOW HE MUTTERED IN EMBARRASSMENT I FLUSHED CRIMSON AS I DID SO I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD OWED SIMONOV FIFTEEN ROUBLES FOR AGES
481-123720-0039 WHICH I HAD INDEED NEVER FORGOTTEN THOUGH I HAD NOT PAID IT
481-123720-0040 VEXED THAT I HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT THAT DOESN'T MATTER YOU CAN PAY TOMORROW AFTER THE DINNER I SIMPLY WANTED TO KNOW PLEASE DON'T HE BROKE OFF AND BEGAN PACING THE ROOM STILL MORE VEXED AS HE WALKED HE BEGAN TO STAMP WITH HIS HEELS
481-123720-0041 AM I KEEPING YOU I ASKED AFTER TWO MINUTES OF SILENCE
481-123720-0042 THAT IS TO BE TRUTHFUL YES I HAVE TO GO AND SEE SOMEONE NOT FAR FROM HERE
481-123720-0043 MY GOODNESS WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO I CRIED
481-123720-0044 IT'S CLOSE BY NOT TWO PACES AWAY SIMONOV REPEATED ACCOMPANYING ME TO THE FRONT DOOR WITH A FUSSY AIR WHICH DID NOT SUIT HIM AT ALL
481-123720-0045 HE WAS VERY GLAD TO GET RID OF ME I WAS IN A FURY WHAT POSSESSED ME WHAT POSSESSED ME TO FORCE MYSELF UPON THEM I WONDERED GRINDING MY TEETH AS I STRODE ALONG THE STREET FOR A SCOUNDREL A PIG LIKE THAT ZVERKOV OF COURSE
481-123720-0046 I HAD BETTER NOT GO OF COURSE I MUST JUST SNAP MY FINGERS AT THEM
481-123720-0047 BUT WHAT MADE ME FURIOUS WAS THAT I KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT I SHOULD GO THAT I SHOULD MAKE A POINT OF GOING AND THE MORE TACTLESS THE MORE UNSEEMLY MY GOING WOULD BE THE MORE CERTAINLY I WOULD GO AND THERE WAS A POSITIVE OBSTACLE TO MY GOING
481-123720-0048 I HAD NO MONEY ALL I HAD WAS NINE ROUBLES I HAD TO GIVE SEVEN OF THAT TO MY SERVANT APOLLON FOR HIS MONTHLY WAGES THAT WAS ALL I PAID HIM HE HAD TO KEEP HIMSELF
481-123720-0049 NOT TO PAY HIM WAS IMPOSSIBLE CONSIDERING HIS CHARACTER BUT I WILL TALK ABOUT THAT FELLOW ABOUT THAT PLAGUE OF MINE ANOTHER TIME HOWEVER I KNEW I SHOULD GO AND SHOULD NOT PAY HIM HIS WAGES THAT NIGHT I HAD THE MOST HIDEOUS DREAMS
481-123720-0050 I WAS SENT TO THE SCHOOL BY DISTANT RELATIONS UPON WHOM I WAS DEPENDENT AND OF WHOM I HAVE HEARD NOTHING SINCE THEY SENT ME THERE A FORLORN SILENT BOY ALREADY CRUSHED BY THEIR REPROACHES ALREADY TROUBLED BY DOUBT
481-123720-0051 AND LOOKING WITH SAVAGE DISTRUST AT EVERYONE MY SCHOOLFELLOWS MET ME WITH SPITEFUL AND MERCILESS JIBES BECAUSE I WAS NOT LIKE ANY OF THEM BUT I COULD NOT ENDURE THEIR TAUNTS
481-123720-0052 I COULD NOT GIVE IN TO THEM WITH THE IGNOBLE READINESS WITH WHICH THEY GAVE IN TO ONE ANOTHER I HATED THEM FROM THE FIRST AND SHUT MYSELF AWAY FROM EVERYONE IN TIMID WOUNDED AND DISPROPORTIONATE PRIDE
481-123720-0053 THEIR COARSENESS REVOLTED ME THEY LAUGHED CYNICALLY AT MY FACE AT MY CLUMSY FIGURE AND YET WHAT STUPID FACES THEY HAD THEMSELVES IN OUR SCHOOL THE BOYS FACES SEEMED IN A SPECIAL WAY TO DEGENERATE AND GROW STUPIDER
481-123720-0054 HOW MANY FINE LOOKING BOYS CAME TO US IN A FEW YEARS THEY BECAME REPULSIVE EVEN AT SIXTEEN I WONDERED AT THEM MOROSELY EVEN THEN I WAS STRUCK BY THE PETTINESS OF THEIR THOUGHTS THE STUPIDITY OF THEIR PURSUITS
481-123720-0055 THEIR GAMES THEIR CONVERSATIONS THEY HAD NO UNDERSTANDING OF SUCH ESSENTIAL THINGS THEY TOOK NO INTEREST IN SUCH STRIKING IMPRESSIVE SUBJECTS THAT I COULD NOT HELP CONSIDERING THEM INFERIOR TO MYSELF
481-123720-0056 IT WAS NOT WOUNDED VANITY THAT DROVE ME TO IT AND FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT THRUST UPON ME YOUR HACKNEYED REMARKS REPEATED TO NAUSEA THAT I WAS ONLY A DREAMER WHILE THEY EVEN THEN HAD AN UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE
481-123720-0057 THEY TOOK RANK FOR INTELLIGENCE EVEN AT SIXTEEN THEY WERE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT A SNUG BERTH OF COURSE A GREAT DEAL OF IT WAS DUE TO THEIR STUPIDITY TO THE BAD EXAMPLES WITH WHICH THEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN SURROUNDED IN THEIR CHILDHOOD AND BOYHOOD
481-123720-0058 THEY WERE MONSTROUSLY DEPRAVED OF COURSE A GREAT DEAL OF THAT TOO WAS SUPERFICIAL AND AN ASSUMPTION OF CYNICISM OF COURSE THERE WERE GLIMPSES OF YOUTH AND FRESHNESS EVEN IN THEIR DEPRAVITY BUT EVEN THAT FRESHNESS WAS NOT ATTRACTIVE
481-123720-0059 AND SHOWED ITSELF IN A CERTAIN RAKISHNESS I HATED THEM HORRIBLY THOUGH PERHAPS I WAS WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM THEY REPAID ME IN THE SAME WAY AND DID NOT CONCEAL THEIR AVERSION FOR ME BUT BY THEN I DID NOT DESIRE THEIR AFFECTION
481-123720-0060 ON THE CONTRARY I CONTINUALLY LONGED FOR THEIR HUMILIATION TO ESCAPE FROM THEIR DERISION I PURPOSELY BEGAN TO MAKE ALL THE PROGRESS I COULD WITH MY STUDIES AND FORCED MY WAY TO THE VERY TOP THIS IMPRESSED THEM
481-123720-0061 MOREOVER THEY ALL BEGAN BY DEGREES TO GRASP THAT I HAD ALREADY READ BOOKS NONE OF THEM COULD READ AND UNDERSTOOD THINGS NOT FORMING PART OF OUR SCHOOL CURRICULUM OF WHICH THEY HAD NOT EVEN HEARD THEY TOOK A SAVAGE AND SARCASTIC VIEW OF IT
481-123720-0062 BUT WERE MORALLY IMPRESSED ESPECIALLY AS THE TEACHERS BEGAN TO NOTICE ME ON THOSE GROUNDS THE MOCKERY CEASED BUT THE HOSTILITY REMAINED AND COLD AND STRAINED RELATIONS BECAME PERMANENT BETWEEN US IN THE END I COULD NOT PUT UP WITH IT
481-123720-0063 WITH YEARS A CRAVING FOR SOCIETY FOR FRIENDS DEVELOPED IN ME I ATTEMPTED TO GET ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH SOME OF MY SCHOOLFELLOWS BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER MY INTIMACY WITH THEM WAS ALWAYS STRAINED AND SOON ENDED OF ITSELF
481-123720-0064 ONCE INDEED I DID HAVE A FRIEND
481-123720-0065 AND REPULSED HIM AS THOUGH ALL I NEEDED HIM FOR WAS TO WIN A VICTORY OVER HIM TO SUBJUGATE HIM AND NOTHING ELSE BUT I COULD NOT SUBJUGATE ALL OF THEM MY FRIEND WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE THEM EITHER HE WAS IN FACT A RARE EXCEPTION
481-123720-0066 THE FIRST THING I DID ON LEAVING SCHOOL WAS TO GIVE UP THE SPECIAL JOB FOR WHICH I HAD BEEN DESTINED SO AS TO BREAK ALL TIES
481-123720-0067 AND GOODNESS KNOWS WHY AFTER ALL THAT I SHOULD GO TRUDGING OFF TO SIMONOV'S EARLY NEXT MORNING I ROUSED MYSELF AND JUMPED OUT OF BED WITH EXCITEMENT AS THOUGH IT WERE ALL ABOUT TO HAPPEN AT ONCE
481-123720-0068 BUT I BELIEVED THAT SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WAS COMING AND WOULD INEVITABLY COME THAT DAY OWING TO ITS RARITY PERHAPS ANY EXTERNAL EVENT HOWEVER TRIVIAL ALWAYS MADE ME FEEL AS THOUGH SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WERE AT HAND
481-123720-0069 I WENT TO THE OFFICE HOWEVER AS USUAL BUT SNEAKED AWAY HOME TWO HOURS EARLIER TO GET READY THE GREAT THING I THOUGHT IS NOT TO BE THE FIRST TO ARRIVE OR THEY WILL THINK I AM OVERJOYED AT COMING BUT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF SUCH
481-123720-0070 AND THEY ALL AGITATED AND OVERWHELMED ME I POLISHED MY BOOTS A SECOND TIME WITH MY OWN HANDS NOTHING IN THE WORLD WOULD HAVE INDUCED APOLLON TO CLEAN THEM TWICE A DAY AS HE CONSIDERED THAT IT WAS MORE THAN HIS DUTIES REQUIRED OF HIM
481-123720-0071 I STOLE THE BRUSHES TO CLEAN THEM FROM THE PASSAGE BEING CAREFUL HE SHOULD NOT DETECT IT FOR FEAR OF HIS CONTEMPT
481-123720-0072 I HAD LET MYSELF GET TOO SLOVENLY MY UNIFORM PERHAPS WAS TIDY BUT I COULD NOT GO OUT TO DINNER IN MY UNIFORM THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT ON THE KNEE OF MY TROUSERS WAS A BIG YELLOW STAIN
481-123720-0073 I HAD A FOREBODING THAT THAT STAIN WOULD DEPRIVE ME OF NINE TENTHS OF MY PERSONAL DIGNITY I KNEW TOO THAT IT WAS VERY POOR TO THINK SO BUT THIS IS NO TIME FOR THINKING NOW I AM IN FOR THE REAL THING I THOUGHT AND MY HEART SANK
481-123720-0074 I KNEW TOO PERFECTLY WELL EVEN THEN THAT I WAS MONSTROUSLY EXAGGERATING THE FACTS BUT HOW COULD I HELP IT
481-123720-0075 WITH DESPAIR I PICTURED TO MYSELF HOW COLDLY AND DISDAINFULLY THAT SCOUNDREL ZVERKOV WOULD MEET ME
481-123720-0076 WITH WHAT IMPUDENT RUDENESS THE INSECT FERFITCHKIN WOULD SNIGGER AT ME IN ORDER TO CURRY FAVOUR WITH ZVERKOV HOW COMPLETELY SIMONOV WOULD TAKE IT ALL IN AND HOW HE WOULD DESPISE ME FOR THE ABJECTNESS OF MY VANITY AND LACK OF SPIRIT
481-123720-0077 AND WORST OF ALL HOW PALTRY UNLITERARY COMMONPLACE IT WOULD ALL BE
481-123720-0078 BUT THAT WAS MOST IMPOSSIBLE OF ALL IF I FEEL IMPELLED TO DO ANYTHING I SEEM TO BE PITCHFORKED INTO IT I SHOULD HAVE JEERED AT MYSELF EVER AFTERWARDS SO YOU FUNKED IT YOU FUNKED IT YOU FUNKED THE REAL THING
481-123720-0079 ON THE CONTRARY I PASSIONATELY LONGED TO SHOW ALL THAT RABBLE THAT I WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A SPIRITLESS CREATURE AS I SEEMED TO MYSELF WHAT IS MORE EVEN IN THE ACUTEST PAROXYSM OF THIS COWARDLY FEVER I DREAMED OF GETTING THE UPPER HAND
481-123720-0080 OF DOMINATING THEM CARRYING THEM AWAY MAKING THEM LIKE ME IF ONLY FOR MY ELEVATION OF THOUGHT AND UNMISTAKABLE WIT THEY WOULD ABANDON ZVERKOV HE WOULD SIT ON ONE SIDE SILENT AND ASHAMED WHILE I SHOULD CRUSH HIM THEN PERHAPS
481-123720-0081 WE WOULD BE RECONCILED AND DRINK TO OUR EVERLASTING FRIENDSHIP BUT WHAT WAS MOST BITTER AND HUMILIATING FOR ME WAS THAT I KNEW EVEN THEN KNEW FULLY AND FOR CERTAIN THAT I NEEDED NOTHING OF ALL THIS REALLY THAT I DID NOT REALLY WANT TO CRUSH
481-123720-0082 TO SUBDUE TO ATTRACT THEM
481-123720-0083 OH HOW I PRAYED FOR THE DAY TO PASS QUICKLY
481-123720-0084 OPENED THE MOVABLE PANE AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE TROUBLED DARKNESS OF THE THICKLY FALLING WET SNOW AT LAST MY WRETCHED LITTLE CLOCK HISSED OUT FIVE I SEIZED MY HAT AND TRYING NOT TO LOOK AT APOLLON
481-123720-0085 WHO HAD BEEN ALL DAY EXPECTING HIS MONTH'S WAGES BUT IN HIS FOOLISHNESS WAS UNWILLING TO BE THE FIRST TO SPEAK ABOUT IT I SLIPPED BETWEEN HIM AND THE DOOR AND JUMPING INTO A HIGH CLASS SLEDGE ON WHICH I SPENT MY LAST HALF ROUBLE
4813-248638-0000 A TOWN OF ENTERPRISE AND CHARACTER EVER SINCE THE FIRST WATER POWER MILL IN THIS COUNTRY THE FIRST POWDER MILL IN THIS COUNTRY THE FIRST CHOCOLATE MILL IN THIS COUNTRY AND THUS THROUGH A WHOLE LINE OF FIRST THINGS THE FIRST VIOLONCELLO
4813-248638-0001 FEW PEOPLE TO DAY THINK OF MILTON IN TERMS OF INDUSTRIAL REPUTE BUT RATHER AS A PLACE OF ESTATES TOO ARISTOCRATIC TO BE FASHIONABLE
4813-248638-0002 AND OF CHARMING WALKS AND DRIVES AND VIEWS MANY OF THE OLD FAMILIES WHO HAVE GIVEN THE TOWN ITS PRESTIGE STILL LIVE IN THEIR ANCESTRAL MANORS AND MANY OF THE FAMILIES WHO HAVE MOVED THERE IN RECENT YEARS
4813-248638-0003 AS THE STRANGER PASSES THROUGH MILTON HE IS CAPTIVATED BY GLIMPSES OF ANCIENT HOMESTEADS SETTLING BEHIND THEIR WHITE COLONIAL FENCES TOPPED WITH WHITE COLONIAL URNS HALF HIDDEN BY THEIR ANTIQUE TREES WITH AN AIR OF COMFORTABLE EASE
4813-248638-0004 OF BREEDING THAT NEITHER PARADES NOR CONCEALS ITS QUALITY YES THIS IS MILTON THIS IS MODERN MILTON BOSTON SOCIETY RECEIVES SOME OF ITS MOST PROMINENT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THIS PATRICIAN SOURCE
4813-248638-0005 BUT MODERN MILTON IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THIS AS OLD MILTON
4813-248638-0006 THAT SWIMS FOREVER AGAINST THE SKY THAT MARCHES FOREVER AROUND THE HORIZON THE ROUNDED SUMMITS OF THE BLUE HILLS TO WHICH THE EYE IS IRRESISTIBLY ATTRACTED BEFORE ENTERING THE TOWN WHICH PRINCIPALLY CLAIMS THEM ARE THE WORN DOWN STUMPS OF ANCIENT MOUNTAINS
4813-248638-0007 AND ALTHOUGH SO LEVELED BY THE PROCESS OF THE AGES THEY ARE STILL THE HIGHEST LAND NEAR THE COAST FROM MAINE TO MEXICO THESE EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY SKYEY CRESTS FORM THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE SO CALLED BOSTON BASIN
4813-248638-0008 AND ARE THE MOST PROMINENT FEATURE OF THE SOUTHERN COAST FROM THEM THE MASSACHUSET TRIBE ABOUT THE BAY DERIVED ITS NAME SIGNIFYING NEAR THE GREAT HILLS WHICH NAME WAS CHANGED BY THE ENGLISH TO MASSACHUSETTS
4813-248638-0009 AND APPLIED TO BOTH BAY AND COLONY ALTHOUGH ITS INDIAN NAME HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM THIS LOVELY RANGE THE LOVELINESS REMAINS ALL THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY SHIMMERS UNDER THE MYSTERIOUS BLOOM OF THESE HEIGHTS
4813-248638-0010 SO VAST THAT EVERYTHING ELSE IS DWARFED BESIDE THEM AND YET SO CURIOUSLY AIRY THAT THEY SEEM TO PERPETUALLY RIPPLE AGAINST THE SKY THE GREAT BLUE HILL ESPECIALLY THE ONE WHICH BEARS AN OBSERVATORY ON ITS SUMMIT SWIMS ABOVE ONE'S HEAD
4813-248638-0011 IT SEEMS TO HAVE A SINGULAR WAY OF MOVING FROM POINT TO POINT AS ONE MOTORS AND ALTHOUGH ONE MAY BE FORCED TO ADMIT THAT THIS MAY BE DUE MORE TO THE WINDING ROADS THAN TO THE ILLUSIVENESS OF THE HILL STILL THE BUOYANT EFFECT IS THE SAME
4813-248638-0012 RUSKIN DECLARES SOMEWHERE WITH HIS QUAINT AND CHARACTERISTIC MIXTURE OF POSITIVENESS AND IDEALISM THAT INHABITANTS OF GRANITE COUNTRIES
4813-248638-0013 THAT CLEARLY DISTINGUISHES THEM FROM THE INHABITANTS OF LESS PURE DISTRICTS PERHAPS HE WAS RIGHT FOR SURELY HERE
4813-248638-0014 EACH HAS THROUGH ITS OWN FAIR NAME DONE HONOR TO THE FAIR NAMES WHICH HAVE PRECEDED IT ONE OF THE VERY FIRST TO BE ATTRACTED BY THE LOFTY AND YET LOVELY APPEAL OF THIS REGION WAS GOVERNOR THOMAS HUTCHINSON
4813-248638-0015 AND THE WIDE FLAT TWIST OF THE NEPONSET RIVER WINDING THROUGH IT FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A DECORATIVE PANEL
4813-248638-0016 THIS IS THE VIEW THAT THE GOVERNOR SO ADMIRED AND TRADITION TELLS US
4813-248638-0017 HE WALKED ON FOOT DOWN THE HILL SHAKING HANDS WITH HIS NEIGHBORS PATRIOT AND TORY ALIKE WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES AS HE LEFT BEHIND HIM THE GARDEN AND THE TREES HE HAD PLANTED AND THE HOUSE WHERE HE HAD SO HAPPILY LIVED
4813-248638-0018 THE VIEW FROM THE BACK HOLDS EVEN MORE INTIMATE ATTRACTION HERE IS THE OLD OLD GARDEN AND ALTHOUGH THE EPHEMERAL BLOSSOMS OF THE PRESENT SPRINGTIME SHINE BRIGHTLY FORTH THE BOX FULL TWENTY FEET HIGH SPEAKS OF ANOTHER EPOCH
4813-248638-0019 THAT VISITORS ON ENTERING FROM THE STREET MIGHT SEE THE GLEAM OF HIS GOLD KNEE BUCKLES AS HE STOOD ON THE DISTANT PORCH THE AVENUE HOWEVER WAS NEVER COMPLETED AS BELCHER WAS APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF AND TRANSFERRED TO NEW JERSEY SHORTLY AFTER
4813-248638-0020 TWO OTHER MEN OF NOTE WHO SINCE THE DAYS OF OUR YEARS ARE BUT THREESCORE AND TEN CHOSE THAT THEIR DAYS WITHOUT NUMBER SHOULD BE SPENT IN THE TOWN THEY LOVED WERE WENDELL PHILLIPS AND RIMMER THE SCULPTOR WHO ARE BOTH BURIED AT MILTON
4813-248638-0021 NOT ONLY NOTABLE PERSONAGES BUT NOTABLE EVENTS HAVE BEEN ENGENDERED UNDER THE SHADOW OF THESE HILLS THE SUFFOLK RESOLVES WHICH WERE THE PRELUDE OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WERE ADOPTED AT THE VOSE HOUSE
4813-248638-0022 STILL RETAINS IN ITS BROAD HOSPITABLE LINES SOME SHRED OF ITS ANCIENT CHARM MILTON IS FULL OF HISTORY FROM THE REVOLUTIONARY DAYS WHEN THE CANNONADING AT BUNKER HILL SHOOK THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE HOUSES BUT NOT THE NERVES OF THE MILTON LADIES
4813-248638-0023 WHEN THE FOURTH LIBERTY LOAN OF TWO MILLION NINE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS WAS SUBSCRIBED FROM A POPULATION OF NINE THOUSAND ALL THE VARIOUS VICISSITUDES OF PEACE AND WAR HAVE BEEN SUSTAINED ON THE HIGH LEVEL
4813-248638-0024 THAT ONE MIGHT EXPECT FROM MEN AND WOMEN NOBLY NURTURED BY THE STRENGTH OF THE HILLS HOW MUCH OF ITS SUCCESS MILTON ATTRIBUTES TO ITS LOCATION FOR ONE JOINS INDEED A DISTINGUISHED FELLOWSHIP WHEN ONE BUILDS UPON A HILL
4813-248638-0025 OR ON SEVERAL HILLS AS ROMAN AS WELL AS BOSTONIAN HISTORY TESTIFIES CAN ONLY BE GUESSED BY ITS TRIBUTE IN THE FORM OF THE BLUE HILLS RESERVATION THIS STATE RECREATION PARK AND FOREST RESERVE
4813-248638-0026 OF ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND ACRES A LABYRINTH OF IDYLLIC FOOTPATHS AND LEAFY TRAILS OF TWISTING DRIVES AND WALKS THAT OPEN OUT UPON SUPERB VISTAS IS NOW THE PROPERTY OF THE PEOPLE OF MASSACHUSETTS THE GRANITE QUARRY MAN
4813-248638-0027 FAR MORE INTERESTED IN THE VALUE OF THE STONE THAT UNDERLAY THE WOODED SLOPES THAN IN RUSKIN'S THEORY OF ITS PURIFYING EFFECT UPON THE INHABITANTS HAD ALREADY OBTAINED A FOOTING HERE WHEN UNDER THE ABLE LEADERSHIP OF CHARLES FRANCIS ADAMS
4813-248638-0028 THE WHOLE REGION WAS TAKEN OVER BY THE STATE IN EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR AS YOU PASS THROUGH THE RESERVATION AND IF YOU ARE TAKING EVEN THE MOST CURSORY GLIMPSE OF MILTON YOU MUST INCLUDE SOME PORTION OF THIS PARK
4813-248638-0029 THE RACE TRACK WITH ITS JUDGES STANDS IS STILL THERE BUT THERE ARE NO MORE HORSE RACES ALTHOUGH THE FORBES FAMILY STILL HOLDS A CONSPICUOUS PLACE
4813-248638-0030 YOU MAY SEE TOO A SOLITARY FIGURE WITH A SCIENTIST'S STOOP OR A TUTOR WITH A GROUP OF BOYS MAKING A FIRST HAND STUDY OF A REGION WHICH IS FULL OF INTEREST TO THE GEOLOGIST CIRCLING THUS AROUND THE BASE OF THE GREAT BLUE HILL
4813-248638-0031 ERECTED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR BY THE LATE A LAWRENCE ROTCH OF MILTON WHO BEQUEATHED FUNDS FOR ITS MAINTENANCE IT IS NOW CONNECTED WITH HARVARD UNIVERSITY
4813-248638-0032 ONCE AT THE TOP THE EYE IS OVERWHELMED BY A CIRCUIT OF MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES IT IS ALMOST TOO IMMENSE AT FIRST ALMOST AS BARREN AS AN EMPTY EXPANSE OF ROLLING GREEN SEA BUT AS THE EYE GROWS ACCUSTOMED TO THE STRETCHING DISTANCES
4813-248638-0033 OBJECTS BOTH NEAR AND FAR BEGIN TO APPEAR AND SOON IF THE DAY IS CLEAR BUILDINGS MAY BE IDENTIFIED IN MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE VILLAGES WE ARE SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE FEET ABOVE THE SEA ON THE HIGHEST COASTLAND
4813-248638-0034 FROM AGAMENTICUS NEAR YORK MAINE TO THE RIO GRANDE AND THE PANORAMA THUS UNROLLED IS TRULY MAGNIFICENT FACING NORTHERLY WE CAN EASILY DISTINGUISH CAMBRIDGE SOMERVILLE AND MALDEN
4813-248638-0035 AND FAR BEYOND THE HILLS OF ANDOVER AND GEORGETOWN A LITTLE TO THE EAST BOSTON WITH ITS GILDED DOME THEN THE HARBOR WITH ITS ISLANDS HEADLANDS AND FORTIFICATIONS
4813-248638-0036 AS FAR AS EASTERN POINT LIGHTHOUSE IN GLOUCESTER FORTY MILES TO THE NORTHEAST APPEAR THE TWIN LIGHTHOUSES ON THATCHER'S ISLAND SEEMING FROM HERE TO BE STANDING NOT ON THE LAND BUT OUT IN THE OCEAN
4813-248638-0037 WHILE BEYOND IT STRETCHES MASSACHUSETTS BAY TURNING NEARLY EAST THE EYE PASSING OVER CHICKATAWBUT HILL THREE MILES OFF AND SECOND IN HEIGHT OF THE BLUE HILLS FOLLOWS THE BEAUTIFUL CURVE OF NANTASKET BEACH
4813-248638-0038 AND THE POINTING FINGER OF MINOT'S LIGHT FACING NEARLY SOUTH THE LONG RIDGE OF MANOMET HILL IN PLYMOUTH THIRTY THREE MILES AWAY STANDS CLEAR AGAINST THE SKY WHILE TWENTY SIX MILES AWAY IN DUXBURY ONE SEES THE MYLES STANDISH MONUMENT
4813-248638-0039 AND FAR BEYOND IT IS THE GRAND MONADNOCK IN JAFFREY
4813-248638-0040 WITH ITS TWO EQUAL SUMMITS THE NEXT GROUP TO THE RIGHT IS IN LYNDEBORO AT THE RIGHT OF LYNDEBORO AND NEARLY OVER THE READVILLE RAILROAD STATIONS IS JOE ENGLISH HILL AND TO COMPLETE THE ROUND NEARLY NORTH NORTHWEST ARE THE SUMMITS
4813-248638-0041 OF THE UNCANOONUC MOUNTAINS FIFTY NINE MILES AWAY THIS THEN IS THE GREAT BLUE HILL OF MILTON THOSE WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS AND NEW ENGLAND CAN STAND HERE AND PICK OUT A HUNDRED DISTINGUISHING LANDMARKS
4813-248638-0042 AND THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE MAY FIND AN UNPARALLELED OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THE WHOLE REGION AT ONE SWEEP OF THE EYE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF TOPOGRAPHY THE SUMMIT OF GREAT BLUE HILL IS THE PLACE TO REACH BUT FOR THE SENSE OF MYSTERIOUS BEAUTY
4813-248638-0043 THE HILL ITSELF SEEN FROM A DISTANCE FLOATING LIGHTLY LIKE A VAST BLUE BALL AGAINST A VASTER SKY IS DREAMILY SUGGESTIVE IN A WAY WHICH THE ACTUAL VIEW SUPERB AS IT IS IS NOT
4813-248638-0044 ONE REMEMBERS STEVENSON'S OBSERVATION THAT SOMETIMES TO TRAVEL HOPEFULLY IS BETTER THAN TO ARRIVE SO LET US COME DOWN FOR AFTER ALL LOVE IS OF THE VALLEY DOWN AGAIN TO THE OLD TOWN OF MILTON
4813-248638-0045 WE HAVE NOT HALF BEGUN TO WANDER OVER IT NOT HALF BEGUN TO HEAR THE PLEASANT STORIES IT HAS TO TELL WHEN ONE IS AS OLD AS THIS FOR MILTON WAS DISCOVERED BY A BAND FROM PLYMOUTH WHO CAME UP THE NEPONSET RIVER IN SIXTEEN TWENTY ONE
4813-248638-0046 WHICH DRIFTS TO US WITH A TURN OF THE WIND COMES FROM A CHOCOLATE MILL WHOSE TRADE MARK OF A NEAT HANDED MAID WITH HER LITTLE TRAY IS KNOWN ALL OVER THE CIVILIZED WORLD
4813-248638-0047 AND THOSE MILLS STAND UPON THE SITE OF THE FIRST GRIST MILL IN NEW ENGLAND TO BE RUN BY WATER POWER THIS WAS IN SIXTEEN THIRTY FOUR AND ONE LIKES TO PICTURE THE STURDY COLONISTS TRAILING INTO TOWN THEIR PACKS UPON THEIR BACKS
4813-248638-0048 LIKE CHILDREN IN KINDERGARTEN GAMES TO HAVE THEIR GRAIN GROUND ISRAEL STOUGHTON WAS THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO ESTABLISHED THIS FIRST MILL A NAME PERPETUATED
4813-248638-0049 ALL GROUND IS HISTORIC GROUND IN MILTON THAT ROLLICKING GROUP OF SCHOOLBOYS YONDER BELONGS TO AN ACADEMY WHICH HANDSOME AND FLOURISHING AS IT IS TO DAY WAS FOUNDED AS LONG AGO AS SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
4813-248638-0050 SET AGAINST A STONE WALL NEAR ITS ORIGINAL SITE THIS EARLY CHURCH AND EARLY SCHOOL WAS A LOG CABIN WITH A THATCHED ROOF AND LATTICED WINDOWS IF ONE MAY BELIEVE THE RELIEF
4813-248638-0051 BUT MEN OF BRAINS AND CHARACTER WERE TAUGHT THERE LESSONS WHICH STOOD THEM AND THE COLONY IN GOOD STEAD ONE FANCIES THE STUDENTS ROVING EYES MAY HAVE OCCASIONALLY STRAYED DOWN THE INDIAN TRAIL DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE OLD SITE A TRAIL WHICH
4813-248638-0052 ALTHOUGH NOW ATTAINED TO THE PROUD RANK OF A LANE CHURCHILL'S LANE STILL INVITES ONE DOWN ITS TANGLED GREEN WAY ALONG THE GRAY STONE WALL YES EVERY STEP OF GROUND HAS ITS TRADITION HERE
4813-248638-0053 YONDER RAILROAD TRACK MARKS THE SPOT WHERE THE VERY FIRST TIE IN THE COUNTRY WAS LAID AND LAID FOR NO LESS SIGNIFICANT PURPOSE THAN TO FACILITATE THE CARRYING OF GRANITE BLOCKS FOR BUNKER HILL MONUMENT FROM THEIR QUARRY TO THE HARBOR GRANITE FROM THE HILLS
4813-248638-0054 AGAIN WE ARE DRAWN BACK TO THE IRRESISTIBLE MAGNET OF THOSE MIGHTY MONITORS YES WHEREVER ONE GOES IN MILTON EITHER ON FOOT TO DAY OR BACK THROUGH THE CHAPTERS OF THREE CENTURIES AGO THE BLUE HILLS DOMINATE EVERY EVENT
4813-248638-0055 AND THE GREAT BLUE HILL FLOATS ABOVE THEM ALL
4813-248641-0000 MANY OF THE CARS ARE MODERATELY PRICED AFFAIRS THE TONNEAU WELL FILLED WITH CHILDREN OF MISCELLANEOUS AGES AND ENLIVENED BY A FAMILY DOG OR TWO FOR THIS IS THE WAY THAT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD SPENDS ITS MODERN SABBATH HOLIDAY
4813-248641-0001 FOR A ROAD ORIGINALLY MARKED BY THE MOCCASINED FEET OF INDIANS AND WIDENED GRADUALLY BY THE TOILSOME JOURNEYINGS OF ROUGH COLONIAL CARTS AND COACHES
4813-248641-0002 IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHICH FEATURE OF THE STEADILY MOVING TRAVEL WOULD MOST FORCIBLY STRIKE THE ORIGINAL PURITAN SETTLERS OF THE TOWN THE FACT THAT EVEN THE COMMON MAN THE POOR MAN COULD OWN SUCH A VEHICLE OF SPEED AND EASE OR THE FACT THAT AMERICA
4813-248641-0003 SUCH A SHORT TIME AGO A WILDERNESS COULD PRODUCE NOT AS THE FINEST FLOWER ON ITS TREE OF EVOLUTION BUT CERTAINLY AS ITS MOST EXOTIC THE PLUTOCRAT WHO LIVES IN A PALACE WITH FIFTY SERVANTS TO DO HIS BIDDING
4813-248641-0004 AND THE FINE LADY WHOSE SOLE EXERCISE OF HER MENTAL AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONS CONSISTS IN ALLOWING HER MAID TO DRESS HER YES NEW ENGLAND HAS CHANGED AMAZINGLY IN THE REVOLUTIONS OF THREE CENTURIES
4813-248641-0005 AND HERE UNDER THE SHADOW OF THIS SQUARE PLAIN BUILDING HINGHAM'S OLD SHIP CHURCH WHILE WE PAUSE TO WATCH THE SUNDAY PAGEANT OF NINETEEN TWENTY WE CAN MOST EASILY CALL BACK THE SABBATH RITES AND THE IDEALS WHICH CREATED THOSE RITES
4813-248641-0006 THIS WOODEN MEETING HOUSE WITH THE TRUNCATED PYRAMIDAL ROOF AND BELFRY TO SERVE AS A LOOKOUT STATION HAS JUST BEEN BUILT A STAGE AHEAD ARCHITECTURALLY OF THE LOG MEETING HOUSE WITH CLAY FILLED CHINKS THATCHED ROOF OILED PAPER WINDOWS
4813-248641-0007 EARTHEN FLOOR AND A STAGE BEHIND THE CHARMING STEEPLE STYLE MADE POPULAR BY SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN AND NOW MULTIPLIED IN COUNTLESS GRACEFUL EXAMPLES ALL OVER NEW ENGLAND
4813-248641-0008 THE OLD SHIP IS ENTIRELY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS AWAITING IT THE DISTINCTION OF BEING THE OLDEST HOUSE FOR PUBLIC WORSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH STILL STANDS ON ITS ORIGINAL SITE AND WHICH IS STILL USED FOR ITS ORIGINAL PURPOSE
4813-248641-0009 IN THE YEAR SIXTEEN EIGHTY ONE IT IS MERELY THE NEW MEETING HOUSE OF THE LITTLE HAMLET OF HINGHAM THE PEOPLE ARE VERY PROUD OF THEIR NEW BUILDING THE TIMBERS HAVE BEEN HEWN WITH THE BROAD AXE OUT OF SOLID WHITE PINE
4813-248641-0010 THE MARKS ARE STILL VISIBLE PARTICULARLY IN THOSE RAFTERS OF THE ROOF OPEN TO THE ATTIC THE BELFRY IS PRECISELY IN THE CENTER OF THE FOUR SIDED PITCHED ROOF TO BE SURE THIS NECESSITATES RINGING THE BELL FROM ONE OF THE PEWS
4813-248641-0011 BUT A LITTLE LATER THE BELLRINGER WILL STAND ABOVE AND THROUGH A PANE OF GLASS LET INTO THE CEILING HE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE WHEN THE MINISTER ENTERS THE PULPIT THE ORIGINAL BACKLESS BENCHES WERE REPLACED BY BOX PEWS WITH NARROW SEATS LIKE SHELVES
4813-248641-0012 NO PAINT NO DECORATIONS NO COLORED WINDOWS NO ORGAN OR ANYTHING WHICH COULD EVEN REMOTELY SUGGEST THE COLOR THE BEAUTY THE FORMALISM OF THE CHURCHES OF ENGLAND
4813-248641-0013 SINCE IN SIXTEEN THIRTY FIVE THE GENERAL COURT DECREED THAT NO DWELLING
4813-248641-0014 OF ANY NEW PLANTATION THUS ELIMINATING THE EXCUSE OF TOO GREAT DISTANCE EVERY ONE IS EXPECTED NAY COMMANDED TO COME TO CHURCH IN FACT AFTER THE TOLLING OF THE LAST BELL THE HOUSES MAY ALL BE SEARCHED
4813-248641-0015 EACH TEN FAMILIES IS UNDER AN INSPECTOR IF THERE IS ANY QUESTION OF DELINQUENTS HIDING IN THEM AND SO IN TWOS AND THREES OFTEN THE MAN TRUDGING AHEAD WITH HIS GUN AND THE WOMAN CARRYING HER BABY WHILE THE SMALLER CHILDREN CLING TO HER SKIRTS
4813-248641-0016 SOMETIMES MAN AND WOMAN AND A CHILD OR TWO ON HORSEBACK NO MATTER HOW WILD THE STORM HOW SWOLLEN THE STREAMS HOW DEEP THE WHIRLING SNOW THEY ALL COME TO CHURCH
4813-248641-0017 THE CONGREGATION EITHER WAITS FOR THE MINISTER AND HIS WIFE OUTSIDE THE DOOR OR STANDS UNTIL HE HAS ENTERED THE PULPIT ONCE INSIDE THEY ARE SEATED WITH THE MOST METICULOUS EXACTNESS ACCORDING TO RANK AGE SEX AND WEALTH
4813-248641-0018 AND THE SLAVES AND INDIANS ARE IN THE REAR TO SEAT ONE'S SELF IN THE WRONG PUE IS AN OFFENSE PUNISHABLE BY A FINE HERE IS THE CHURCH AND HERE ARE THE PEOPLE AS THE OLD RHYME HAS IT WHAT THEN OF THE SERVICES
4813-248641-0019 THAT THEY ARE INTERMINABLE WE KNOW THE TITHING MAN OR CLERK MAY TURN THE BRASS BOUND HOURGLASS BY THE SIDE OF THE PULPIT TWO AND THREE TIMES DURING THE SERMON AND ONCE OR TWICE DURING THE PRAYER INTERMINABLE
4813-248641-0020 THE OLD SHIP WAS NOT HEATED UNTIL EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWO THE ONLY RELIEF FROM THE CHILL AND STIFFNESS COMES DURING THE PRAYER WHEN THE CONGREGATION STANDS KNEELING OF COURSE WOULD SAVOR TOO STRONGLY OF IDOLATRY AND THE CHURCH OF ROME
4813-248641-0021 THEY STAND TOO WHILE THE PSALMS AND HYMNS ARE LINED OUT AND AS THEY SING THEM VERY UNCERTAINLY AND VERY INCORRECTLY THIS PERFORMANCE ALONE SOMETIMES TAKES AN HOUR AS THERE IS NO ORGAN NOR NOTES
4813-248641-0022 AND ONLY A FEW COPIES OF THE BAY PSALM BOOK OF WHICH BY THE WAY A COPY NOW WOULD BE WORTH MANY TIMES ITS WEIGHT IN GOLD AFTER THE MORNING SERVICE THERE IS A NOON INTERMISSION IN WHICH THE HALF FROZEN CONGREGATION STIRS AROUND
4813-248641-0023 ONE SOMETIMES WONDERS HOW THE LITTLE THINGS HAD ANY IMPULSE TO LAUGH IN SUCH AN ABYSMAL ATMOSPHERE BUT APPARENTLY THE PURITAN BOYS AND GIRLS WERE ENTIRELY NORMAL AND EVEN WHOLESOMELY MISCHIEVOUS AS PROVED BY THE CONSTANTLY REQUIRED SERVICES OF THE TITHING MAN
4813-248641-0024 THESE EXTERNAL TRAPPINGS OF THE SERVICE SOUND DEPRESSING ENOUGH BUT IF THE MESSAGE RECEIVED WITHIN THESE CHILLY WALLS IS CHEERING MAYBE WE CAN FORGET OR IGNORE THE PHYSICAL DISCOMFORTS BUT IS THE MESSAGE CHEERING HELL DAMNATION ETERNAL TORTURES
4813-248641-0025 PAINFUL THEOLOGICAL HAIR SPLITTINGS HARROWING SELF EXAMINATIONS AND HUMILIATING PUBLIC CONFESSIONS THIS IS WHAT THEY GATHER ON THE NARROW WOODEN BENCHES TO LISTEN TO HOUR AFTER HOUR SEARCHING THEIR SOULS FOR SIN WITH AN ALMOST FRENZIED EAGERNESS
4813-248641-0026 APPEALING TO THE EMOTIONS QUITE AS VIVIDLY ALTHOUGH THROUGH A DIFFERENT CHANNEL AS THE MOST ELABORATE CEREMONIAL WHEN THE SOUL IS WROUGHT TO A CERTAIN PITCH EACH HARDSHIP IS MERELY AN ADDED OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE ITS FAITH
4813-248641-0027 FROM THE MOTHER CHURCH AND THE MOTHER COUNTRY AND FORTIFY THEM IN THEIR STRUGGLE IN A NEW LAND IT WAS RELIGIOUS ZEAL WHICH FURNISHED THIS MOTIVE POWER DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTS AND DIFFERENTLY DIRECTED FORCE ARE NEEDED TO EXTRACT THE DIAMOND FROM THE EARTH
4813-248641-0028 HAVING DONE ITS WORK HAVING FOUNDED SOUNDLY AND PEOPLED STRONGLY AN EXCEPTIONAL REGION THE NEW ENGLAND CONSCIENCE HAD NO FURTHER NECESSITY FOR BEING THOSE WHOM IT NOW TORTURES WITH ITS HOT PINCERS OF DOUBT AND SELF REPROACH
4813-248641-0029 ARE SACRIFICED TO A CAUSE LONG SINCE WON THE PURITANS THEMSELVES GREW AWAY FROM MANY OF THEIR EXCESSIVE SEVERITIES BUT AS THEY GAINED BODILY STRENGTH FROM THEIR CONFLICT WITH THE ELEMENTS SO THEY GAINED A CERTAIN MORAL STAMINA
4813-248641-0030 BY THEIR SELF IMPOSED RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCE AND THIS MORAL STAMINA HAS MARKED NEW ENGLAND EVER SINCE AND MARKED HER TO HER GLORY ONE CANNOT SPEAK OF HINGHAM CHURCHES INDEED ONE CANNOT SPEAK OF HINGHAM
4813-248641-0031 WITHOUT ADMIRING MENTION OF THE NEW NORTH CHURCH THIS BUILDING OF EXQUISITE PROPORTIONS AND FINISH WITHIN AND WITHOUT BUILT BY BULFINCH IN EIGHTEEN O SIX IS ONE OF THE MOST FLAWLESS EXAMPLES OF ITS TYPE ON THE SOUTH SHORE
4813-248641-0032 YOU WILL APPRECIATE THE CREAM COLORED PAINT THE BUFF WALLS THE QUAINT BOX PEWS OF OILED WOOD WITH HANDRAILS GLEAMING FROM THE TOUCH OF MANY GENERATIONS WITH WOODEN BUTTONS AND PROTRUDING HINGES PROCLAIMING AN ANCIENT FASHION
4813-248641-0033 BUT THE UNIQUE FEATURE OF THE NEW NORTH CHURCH IS ITS SLAVE GALLERIES THESE TWO SMALL GALLERIES BETWEEN THE ROOF AND THE CHOIR LOFT HELD FOR THIRTY YEARS IN DIMINISHING NUMBERS NEGROES AND INDIANS
4813-248641-0034 THE LAST OCCUPANT WAS A BLACK LUCRETIA WHO AFTER BEING FREED WAS INVITED TO SIT DOWNSTAIRS WITH HER MASTER AND MISTRESS WHICH SHE DID AND WHICH SHE CONTINUED TO DO UNTIL HER DEATH NOT SO VERY LONG AGO
4813-248641-0035 HINGHAM ITS MAIN STREET ALAS FOR THE ORIGINAL NAME OF BACHELORS ROWE ARCHED BY A DOUBLE ROW OF SUPERB ELMS ON EITHER SIDE IS INCALCULABLY RICH IN OLD HOUSES OLD TRADITIONS OLD FAMILIES
4813-248641-0036 EVEN MOTORING THROUGH TOO QUICKLY AS MOTORISTS MUST ONE CANNOT HELP BEING STRUCK BY THE SUBSTANTIAL DIGNITY OF THE PLACE BY THE WELL KEPT PROSPERITY OF THE HOUSES LARGE AND SMALL WHICH FRINGE THE FINE OLD HIGHWAY
4813-248641-0037 THE TOWN HAS PRESERVED A CRANFORD LIKE CHARM AND WHY NOT WHEN THE VERY HOUSE IS STILL HANDSOMELY PRESERVED WHERE THE NAMELESS NOBLEMAN FRANCIS LE BARON WAS CONCEALED BETWEEN THE FLOORS
4813-248641-0038 AND AS WE ARE TOLD IN MISSUS AUSTEN'S NOVEL VERY PROPERLY CAPPED THE CLIMAX BY MARRYING HIS BRAVE LITTLE PROTECTOR MOLLY WILDER WHY NOT WHEN THE LINCOLN FAMILY ANCESTORS OF ABRAHAM
4813-248641-0039 NAMED AFTER THE INDIAN CHIEF WHO GRANTED THE ORIGINAL DEEDS OF THE TOWN HAS FOUND QUARTERS IN AN EXTREMELY INTERESTING HOUSE DATING FROM SIXTEEN EIGHTY IN THE SPACIOUS LIVING ROOM ARE SEVENTEEN PANELS ON THE WALLS AND IN THE DOORS
4813-248641-0040 PAINTED WITH CHARMING OLD FASHIONED SKILL BY JOHN HAZLITT THE BROTHER OF THE ENGLISH ESSAYIST THE REVEREND DANIEL SHUTE HOUSE BUILT IN SEVENTEEN FORTY SIX IS PRACTICALLY INTACT WITH ITS PANELED ROOMS
4813-248641-0041 AND WALL PAPER A HUNDRED YEARS OLD HINGHAM'S FAMOUS ELMS SHADE THE HOUSE WHERE PARSON EBENEZER GAY LIVED OUT HIS LONG PASTORATE OF SIXTY NINE YEARS AND NINE MONTHS AND THE GARRISON HOUSE BUILT BEFORE SIXTEEN FORTY
4813-248641-0042 SHELTERED IN ITS PRIME NINE GENERATIONS OF THE SAME FAMILY THE RAINBOW ROOF HOUSE SO CALLED FROM THE DELICIOUS CURVE IN ITS ROOF IS ONE OF HINGHAM'S PRETTIEST TWO HUNDRED YEAR OLD COTTAGES AND MISS SUSAN B WILLARD'S COTTAGE
4813-248641-0043 IS ONE OF THE OLDEST IN THE UNITED STATES DERBY ACADEMY FOUNDED ALMOST TWO CENTURIES AND A HALF AGO BY MADAM DERBY STILL MAINTAINS ITS SOCIAL AND SCHOLARLY PRESTIGE THROUGH ALL THE EDUCATIONAL TURMOIL OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
4813-248641-0044 THAT JOHN ALBION ANDREW WHO PROVED HIMSELF SO TRULY ONE OF OUR GREAT MEN DURING THE CIVIL WAR COURTED ELIZA JONES HERSEY AND HERE THAT THE HAPPY YEARS OF THEIR EARLY MARRIED LIFE WERE SPENT
4813-248641-0045 LATER ANOTHER GOVERNOR JOHN D LONG WAS FOR MANY YEARS A MIGHTY FIGURE IN THE TOWN WITH ITS ANCIENT CHURCHES AND INSTITUTIONS ITS PENSIVE GRAVEYARDS AND LOVELY ELMS
4813-248641-0046 HINGHAM TYPIFIES WHAT IS QUAINTEST AND BEST IN NEW ENGLAND TOWNS POSSIBLY THE DAPPLING OF THE ELMS POSSIBLY THE SHADOW OF THE OLD SHIP CHURCH
4813-248641-0047 HOWEVER IT MAY SEEM TO ITS INHABITANTS TO THE STRANGER EVERYTHING IN HINGHAM IS TINCTURED BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE STERN OLD ECCLESIASTICISM EVEN THE NUMBER OF HISTORIC FORTS SEEMS A PROPER PART OF THOSE RIGHTEOUS DAYS
4813-248641-0048 FOR WHEN DID RELIGION AND WARFARE NOT GO HAND IN HAND DURING THE TROUBLE WITH KING PHILIP THE TOWN HAD THREE FORTS ONE AT FORT HILL ONE AT THE CEMETERY AND ONE ON THE PLAIN ABOUT A MILE FROM THE HARBOR AND THE SITES MAY STILL BE IDENTIFIED
4813-248641-0049 WERE LANDED ON THEIR SALTY DECKS FOR FIFTY YEARS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN ELEVEN AND EIGHTEEN SIXTY THE RAPID SAILED AS A PACKET BETWEEN THIS TOWN AND BOSTON MAKING THE TRIP ON ONE MEMORABLE OCCASION IN SIXTY SEVEN MINUTES
4813-248641-0050 SHE WAS CARRIED UP THE WEYMOUTH RIVER AND COVERED MASTS AND HULL WITH GREEN BUSHES SO THAT THE MARAUDING BRITISH CRUISERS MIGHT NOT FIND HER AND AS WE READ WE FIND OURSELVES REMEMBERING THAT CAMOUFLAGE IS NEW ONLY IN NAME
4813-248641-0051 OR WOULD THEY REALIZE THAT THEIR SOWING HAD BROUGHT FORTH RICHER FRUIT THAN THEY COULD GUESS IT HAS ALL CHANGED SINCE PURITAN DAYS AND YET PERHAPS IN NO OTHER PLACE IN NEW ENGLAND DOES THE HAND OF THE PAST LIE SO VISIBLY UPON THE COMMUNITY
4813-248641-0052 YOU CANNOT LIFT YOUR EYES BUT THEY REST UPON SOME BUILDING RAISED TWO CENTURIES AND MORE AGO THE SHADE WHICH RIPPLES UNDER YOUR FEET IS CAST BY ELMS PLANTED BY THAT VERY HAND OF THE PAST EVEN YOUR VOICE REPEATS THE WORDS WHICH THOSE OLD PATRIARCHS
4813-248641-0053 WELL VERSED IN BIBLICAL LORE CHOSE FOR THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD NAMES ACCORD POND AND GLAD TIDINGS PLAIN MIGHT HAVE BEEN LIFTED FROM SOME PILGRIM'S PROGRESS WHILE THE NEAR BY SEA OF GALILEE AND JERUSALEM ROAD
4813-248641-0054 ARE FROM THE GOOD BOOK ITSELF WHICH WAY TO EGYPT IS THIS AN ECHO FROM THAT TIME WHEN THE BIBLE WAS THE CORNER STONE OF CHURCH AND STATE OF HOME AND SCHOOL WHAT'S THE BEST ROAD TO JERICHO BEACH SURELY IT IS SOME GRAVE FACED SHADE WHO CALLS
4830-25898-0000 THERE NEVER WAS A PROUDER MAMMA THAN MADAM CLUCK WHEN SHE LED FORTH HER FAMILY OF EIGHT DOWNY LITTLE CHICKS CHANTICLEER STRUT SNOWBALL SPECKLE PEEP PECK DOWNY AND BLOT WERE THEIR NAMES
4830-25898-0001 AND NO SOONER WERE THEY OUT OF THE SHELL THAN THEY BEGAN TO CHIRP AND SCRATCH AS GAILY AS IF THE BIG WORLD IN WHICH THEY SUDDENLY FOUND THEMSELVES WAS MADE FOR THEIR ESPECIAL BENEFIT IT WAS A FINE BROOD
4830-25898-0002 BUT POOR MADAM CLUCK HAD BAD LUCK WITH HER CHICKS FOR THEY WERE HER FIRST AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO MANAGE THEM OLD AUNT COCKLETOP TOLD HER THAT SHE DIDN'T AND PREDICTED THAT THOSE POOR DEARS WOULD COME TO BAD ENDS
4830-25898-0003 AUNT COCKLETOP WAS RIGHT AS YOU WILL SEE WHEN I HAVE TOLD THE SAD HISTORY OF THIS UNFORTUNATE FAMILY THE TRAGEDY BEGAN WITH CHANTY WHO WAS THE BOLDEST LITTLE COCKADOODLE WHO EVER TRIED TO CROW
4830-25898-0004 BEFORE HE HAD A FEATHER TO HIS BIT OF A TAIL CHANTY BEGAN TO FIGHT AND SOON WAS KNOWN AS THE MOST QUARRELSOME CHICK IN THE FARM YARD HAVING PECKED HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS HE TRIED TO DO THE SAME TO HIS PLAYMATES
4830-25898-0005 THE DUCKLINGS GOSLINGS AND YOUNG TURKEYS AND WAS SO DISAGREEABLE THAT ALL THE FOWLS HATED HIM ONE DAY A PAIR OF BANTAMS ARRIVED PRETTY LITTLE WHITE BIRDS WITH RED CRESTS AND NICE YELLOW FEET
4830-25898-0006 CHANTY THOUGHT HE COULD BEAT MISTER BANTAM EASILY HE WAS SO SMALL AND INVITED HIM TO FIGHT MISTER B DECLINED THEN CHANTY CALLED HIM A COWARD AND GAVE MISSUS B A PECK
4830-25898-0007 WHICH ENDED IN CHANTY'S UTTER DEFEAT FOR HE DIED FROM HIS WOUNDS DOWNY AND SNOWBALL SOON FOLLOWED FOR THE TWO SWEET LITTLE THINGS WOULD SWING ON THE BURDOCK LEAVES THAT GREW OVER THE BROOK
4830-25898-0008 SITTING SIDE BY SIDE THE PLUMP SISTERS WERE PLACIDLY SWAYING UP AND DOWN OVER THE CLEAR BROWN WATER RIPPLING BELOW WHEN AH SAD TO RELATE THE STEM BROKE AND DOWN WENT LEAF
4830-25898-0009 CHICKENS AND ALL TO A WATERY DEATH I'M THE MOST UNLUCKY HEN EVER HATCHED GROANED
4830-25898-0010 AND IT DID SEEM SO FOR THE VERY NEXT WEEK SPECKLE THE BEST AND PRETTIEST OF THE BROOD WENT TO WALK WITH AUNT COCKLETOP GRASSHOPPERING THEY CALLED IT IN THE GREAT FIELD ACROSS THE ROAD
4830-25898-0011 WHAT A NICE TIME SPECKLE DID HAVE TO BE SURE FOR THE GRASSHOPPERS WERE LIVELY AND FAT AND AUNT WAS IN AN UNUSUALLY AMIABLE MOOD NEVER RUN AWAY FROM ANYTHING BUT FACE DANGER AND CONQUER IT
4830-25898-0012 LIKE A BRAVE CHICK SAID THE OLD BIDDY AS SHE WENT CLUCKING THROUGH THE GRASS WITH HER GRAY TURBAN WAGGING IN THE WIND SPECKLE HAD HOPPED AWAY FROM A TOAD WITH A STARTLED CHIRP WHICH CAUSED AUNT TO UTTER THAT REMARK
4830-25898-0013 THE WORDS HAD HARDLY LEFT HER BEAK WHEN A SHADOW ABOVE MADE HER LOOK UP GIVE ONE LOUD CROAK OF ALARM AND THEN SCUTTLE AWAY AS FAST AS LEGS AND WINGS COULD CARRY HER LITTLE SPECKLE REMEMBERING THE ADVICE
4830-25898-0014 AND UNCONSCIOUS OF THE DANGER STOOD HER GROUND AS A GREAT HAWK CAME CIRCLING NEARER AND NEARER TILL WITH A SUDDEN DART HE POUNCED ON THE POOR CHICKEN AND BORE IT AWAY CHIRPING DISMALLY
4830-25898-0015 WHAT SHALL I DO IT WAS A DREADFUL BLOW TO MISSUS CLUCK AND AUNT COCKLETOP DIDN'T SHOW HERSELF FOR A WHOLE DAY AFTER THAT STORY WAS KNOWN
4830-25898-0016 FOR EVERY FOWL IN THE YARD TWITTED HER WITH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HER PREACHING AND HER PRACTICE
4830-25898-0017 HE WAS AT IT FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT AND EVERYONE WAS TIRED TO DEATH OF HEARING HIS SHRILL SMALL VOICE MAKING FUNNY ATTEMPTS TO PRODUCE HOARSE LITTLE CROWS AS HE SAT ON THE WALL AND STRETCHED HIS YELLOW NECK
4830-25898-0018 TILL HIS THROAT QUITE ACHED WITH THE EFFORT AH IF I COULD ONLY FLY TO THE HIGHEST BEAM IN THE BARN AND GIVE A SPLENDID CROW THAT EVERYONE COULD HEAR I SHOULD BE PERFECTLY HAPPY SAID THIS SILLY LITTLE FOWL
4830-25898-0019 SO HE TRIED EVERY DAY TO FLY AND CROW AND AT LAST MANAGED TO GET UP THEN HOW HE DID STRUT AND RUSTLE HIS FEATHERS WHILE HIS PLAYMATES SAT BELOW AND WATCHED HIM
4830-25898-0020 YOU'LL FALL AND GET HURT SAID HIS SISTER BLOT HOLD YOUR TONGUE YOU UGLY LITTLE THING AND DON'T TALK TO ME I'M GOING TO CROW AND CAN'T BE INTERRUPTED BY ANY SILLY BIT OF A HEN BE QUIET DOWN THERE
4830-25898-0021 AND HEAR IF I CAN'T DO IT AS WELL AS DADDY THE CHICKS STOPPED SCRATCHING AND PEEPING AND SAT IN A ROW TO HEAR STRUT CROW PERCHING HIMSELF ON THE BEAM HE TRIED HIS BEST
4830-25898-0022 CAME OF IT AND ALL THE CHICKS LAUGHED THAT MADE STRUT MAD AND HE RESOLVED TO CROW EVEN IF HE KILLED HIMSELF DOING IT HE GAVE AN ANGRY CLUCK FLAPPED HIS WINGS AND TRIED AGAIN ALAS ALAS
4830-25898-0023 FOR POOR STRUT HE LEANED SO FAR FORWARD IN HIS FRANTIC EFFORT TO GET A BIG CROW OUT THAT HE TOPPLED OVER AND FELL BUMP ON THE HARD BARN FLOOR KILLING HIMSELF INSTANTLY
4830-25898-0024 FOR SOME TIME AFTER THIS MISSUS CLUCK KEPT HER THREE REMAINING LITTLE ONES CLOSE TO HER SIDE WATCHING OVER THEM WITH MATERNAL CARE TILL THEY WERE HEARTILY TIRED OF HER ANXIOUS CLUCKINGS PEEP AND PECK WERE ALWAYS TOGETHER
4830-25898-0025 BEING VERY FOND OF ONE ANOTHER PEEP WAS A MOST INQUISITIVE CHICKEN POKING HER HEAD INTO EVERY NOOK AND CORNER AND NEVER SATISFIED TILL SHE HAD SEEN ALL THERE WAS TO SEE PECK WAS A GLUTTON
4830-25898-0026 EATING EVERYTHING SHE COULD FIND AND OFTEN MAKING HERSELF ILL BY GOBBLING TOO FAST AND FORGETTING TO EAT A LITTLE GRAVEL TO HELP DIGEST HER FOOD DON'T GO OUT OF THE BARN CHILDREN I'M GOING TO LAY AN EGG
4830-25898-0027 AND CAN'T LOOK AFTER YOU JUST NOW SAID THEIR MOTHER ONE DAY YES MA'AM CHIRPED THE CHICKENS AND THEN AS SHE WENT RUSTLING INTO THE HAY MOW THEY BEGAN TO RUN ABOUT AND ENJOY THEMSELVES WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
4830-25898-0028 PEEP FOUND A LITTLE HOLE INTO THE MEAL ROOM AND SLIPPED IN FULL OF JOY AT THE SIGHT OF THE BAGS BOXES AND BINS I'LL EAT ALL I WANT AND THEN I'LL CALL PECK SHE SAID
4830-25898-0029 AND HAVING TAKEN A TASTE OF EVERY THING SHE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE WHEN SHE HEARD THE STABLEMAN COMING AND IN HER FRIGHT COULDN'T FIND THE HOLE SO FLEW INTO THE MEAL BIN AND HID HERSELF
4830-25898-0030 SAM NEVER SAW HER BUT SHUT DOWN THE COVER OF THE BIN AS HE PASSED AND LEFT POOR PEEP TO DIE NO ONE KNEW WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER TILL SOME DAYS LATER WHEN SHE WAS FOUND DEAD IN THE MEAL
4830-25898-0031 WITH HER POOR LITTLE CLAWS STICKING STRAIGHT UP AS IF IMPLORING HELP PECK MEANWHILE GOT INTO MISCHIEF ALSO
4830-25898-0032 SHE STRAYED INTO THE SHEEP SHED AND FINDING SOME SALT ATE AS MUCH AS SHE LIKED NOT KNOWING THAT SALT IS BAD FOR HENS HAVING TAKEN ALL SHE WANTED SHE RAN BACK TO THE BARN
4830-25898-0033 AND WAS INNOCENTLY CATCHING GNATS WHEN HER MAMMA CAME OUT OF THE HAY MOW WITH A LOUD CUT CUT CUT
4830-25898-0034 WHERE IS PEEP ASKED MISSUS CLUCK
