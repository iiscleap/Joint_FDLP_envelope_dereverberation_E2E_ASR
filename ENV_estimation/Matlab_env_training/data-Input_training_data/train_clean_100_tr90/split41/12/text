2817-142371-0006 I SHOULD THINK A MAN AS HAS LIVED AMONG THE GENTRY FROM A BY
2817-142371-0007 AYE AYE MAN SAID BARTLE WITH A TONE OF SARCASTIC CONSOLATION YOU TALK THE RIGHT LANGUAGE FOR YOU WHEN MIKE HOLDSWORTH'S GOAT SAYS BA A A IT'S ALL RIGHT IT UD BE UNNATURAL FOR IT TO MAKE ANY OTHER NOISE
2817-142371-0008 THE REST OF THE PARTY BEING LOAMSNIRE MEN
2817-142371-0009 AND WISELY FELL BACK ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION WHICH FAR FROM BEING EXHAUSTED IN A SINGLE EVENING WAS RENEWED IN THE CHURCHYARD BEFORE SERVICE THE NEXT DAY WITH THE FRESH INTEREST CONFERRED ON ALL NEWS WHEN THERE IS A FRESH PERSON TO HEAR IT
2817-142371-0010 AND THAT FRESH HEARER WAS MARTIN POYSER WHO AS HIS WIFE SAID
2817-142371-0011 SHE ALWAYS CITED IT AFTERWARDS AS A CASE OF PREVISION WHICH REALLY HAD SOMETHING MORE IN IT THAN HER OWN REMARKABLE PENETRATION THAT THE MOMENT SHE SET EYES ON THE SQUIRE SHE SAID TO HERSELF I SHOULDNA WONDER IF HE'S COME ABOUT THAT MAN
2817-142371-0012 AS IS A GOING TO TAKE THE CHASE FARM WANTING POYSER TO DO SOMETHING FOR HIM WITHOUT PAY BUT POYSER'S A FOOL IF HE DOES
2817-142371-0013 FOR THE OLD SQUIRE'S VISITS TO HIS TENANTRY WERE RARE AND THOUGH MISSUS POYSER HAD DURING THE LAST TWELVEMONTH RECITED MANY IMAGINARY SPEECHES MEANING EVEN MORE THAN MET THE EAR
2817-142371-0014 THE SPEECHES HAD ALWAYS REMAINED IMAGINARY GOOD DAY MISSUS POYSER SAID THE OLD SQUIRE PEERING AT HER WITH HIS SHORT SIGHTED EYES A MODE OF LOOKING AT HER WHICH AS MISSUS POYSER OBSERVED ALLAYS AGGRAVATED ME
2817-142371-0015 IT WAS AS IF YOU WAS A INSECT AND HE WAS GOING TO DAB HIS FINGER NAIL ON YOU HOWEVER SHE SAID YOUR SERVANT SIR AND CURTSIED WITH AN AIR OF PERFECT DEFERENCE AS SHE ADVANCED TOWARDS HIM SHE WAS NOT THE WOMAN TO MISBEHAVE TOWARDS HER BETTERS
2817-142371-0016 AND FLY IN THE FACE OF THE CATECHISM WITHOUT SEVERE PROVOCATION IS YOUR HUSBAND AT HOME MISSUS POYSER YES SIR HE'S ONLY THE RICK YARD I'LL SEND FOR HIM IN A MINUTE IF YOU'LL PLEASE TO GET DOWN AND STEP IN
2817-142371-0017 THANK YOU I WILL DO SO I WANT TO CONSULT HIM ABOUT A LITTLE MATTER BUT YOU ARE QUITE AS MUCH CONCERNED IN IT IF NOT MORE I MUST HAVE YOUR OPINION TOO HETTY RUN AND TELL YOUR UNCLE TO COME IN
2817-142371-0018 SAID MISSUS POYSER AS THEY ENTERED THE HOUSE AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN BOWED LOW IN ANSWER TO HETTY'S CURTSY WHILE TOTTY CONSCIOUS OF A PINAFORE STAINED WITH GOOSEBERRY JAM STOOD HIDING HER FACE AGAINST THE CLOCK AND PEEPING ROUND FURTIVELY
2817-142371-0019 WHAT A FINE OLD KITCHEN THIS IS SAID MISTER DONNITHORNE LOOKING ROUND ADMIRINGLY HE ALWAYS SPOKE IN THE SAME DELIBERATE WELL CHISELLED POLITE WAY WHETHER HIS WORDS WERE SUGARY OR VENOMOUS
2817-142371-0020 AND YOU KEEP IT SO EXQUISITELY CLEAN MISSUS POYSER I LIKE THESE PREMISES DO YOU KNOW BEYOND ANY ON THE ESTATE WELL SIR SINCE YOU'RE FOND OF EM
2817-142371-0021 I SHOULD BE GLAD IF YOU'D LET A BIT O REPAIRS BE DONE TO EM FOR THE BOARDING'S THAT STATE AS WE'RE LIKE TO BE EATEN UP WI RATS AND MICE AND THE CELLAR YOU MAY STAN UP TO YOUR KNEES WATER IN'T IF YOU LIKE TO GO DOWN BUT PERHAPS YOU'D RATHER BELIEVE MY WORDS
2817-142371-0022 NOT YET I MUST SEE YOUR DAIRY
2817-142371-0023 ON ALL HANDS ABOUT YOUR FINE CHEESE AND BUTTER SAID THE SQUIRE LOOKING POLITELY UNCONSCIOUS THAT THERE COULD BE ANY QUESTION ON WHICH HE AND MISSUS POYSER MIGHT HAPPEN TO DISAGREE I THINK I SEE THE DOOR OPEN THERE
2817-142371-0024 YOU MUST NOT BE SURPRISED IF I CAST A COVETOUS EYE ON YOUR CREAM AND BUTTER I DON'T EXPECT THAT MISSUS SATCHELL'S CREAM AND BUTTER WILL BEAR COMPARISON WITH YOURS I CAN'T SAY SIR I'M SURE IT'S SELDOM I SEE OTHER FOLKS'S BUTTER
2817-142371-0025 THOUGH THERE'S SOME ON IT AS ONE'S NO NEED TO SEE THE SMELL'S ENOUGH
2817-142371-0026 BUT KEEPING NEAR THE DOOR I'M SURE I SHOULD LIKE MY BREAKFAST BETTER IF I KNEW THE BUTTER AND CREAM CAME FROM THIS DAIRY THANK YOU THAT REALLY IS A PLEASANT SIGHT UNFORTUNATELY MY SLIGHT TENDENCY TO RHEUMATISM MAKES ME AFRAID OF DAMP
2817-142371-0027 I'LL SIT DOWN IN YOUR COMFORTABLE KITCHEN AH POYSER HOW DO YOU DO IN THE MIDST OF BUSINESS I SEE AS USUAL I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT YOUR WIFE'S BEAUTIFUL DAIRY
2817-142371-0028 MISTER POYSER HAD JUST ENTERED IN SHIRT SLEEVES AND OPEN WAISTCOAT WITH A FACE A SHADE REDDER THAN USUAL FROM THE EXERTION OF PITCHING AS HE STOOD RED ROTUND AND RADIANT
2817-142371-0029 SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN SEATING HIMSELF ON A SMALL CHAIR NEAR THE DOOR DO YOU KNOW MISSUS POYSER SIT DOWN PRAY BOTH OF YOU I'VE BEEN FAR FROM CONTENTED FOR SOME TIME WITH MISSUS SATCHELL'S DAIRY MANAGEMENT
2817-142371-0030 I THINK SHE HAS NOT A GOOD METHOD AS YOU HAVE INDEED SIR I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT SAID MISSUS POYSER IN A HARD VOICE ROLLING AND UNROLLING HER KNITTING AND LOOKING ICILY OUT OF THE WINDOW AS SHE CONTINUED TO STAND OPPOSITE THE SQUIRE
2817-142371-0031 POYSER MIGHT SIT DOWN IF HE LIKED SHE THOUGHT SHE WASN'T GOING TO SIT DOWN AS IF SHE'D GIVE IN TO ANY SUCH SMOOTH TONGUED PALAVER MISTER POYSER WHO LOOKED AND FELT THE REVERSE OF ICY DID SIT DOWN IN HIS THREE CORNERED CHAIR
2817-142371-0032 AND NOW POYSER AS SATCHELL IS LAID UP I AM INTENDING TO LET THE CHASE FARM TO A RESPECTABLE TENANT I'M TIRED OF HAVING A FARM ON MY OWN HANDS NOTHING IS MADE THE BEST OF IN SUCH CASES AS YOU KNOW
2817-142371-0033 SAID MISTER POYSER WITH A GOOD NATURED BLANKNESS OF IMAGINATION AS TO THE NATURE OF THE ARRANGEMENT IF I'M CALLED UPON TO SPEAK SIR SAID MISSUS POYSER AFTER GLANCING AT HER HUSBAND WITH PITY AT HIS SOFTNESS YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ME
2817-142371-0034 NOT BUT WHAT I'M GLAD TO HEAR O ANYBODY RESPECTABLE COMING INTO THE PARISH THERE'S SOME
2817-142371-0035 YOU'RE LIKELY TO FIND MISTER THURLE AN EXCELLENT NEIGHBOUR I ASSURE YOU SUCH A ONE AS YOU WILL FEEL GLAD TO HAVE ACCOMMODATED BY THE LITTLE PLAN I'M GOING TO MENTION ESPECIALLY AS I HOPE YOU WILL FIND IT AS MUCH TO YOUR OWN ADVANTAGE AS HIS
2817-142371-0036 INDEED SIR IF IT'S ANYTHING T OUR ADVANTAGE
2817-142371-0037 I THINK FOLKS HAVE TO WAIT LONG ENOUGH AFORE IT'S BROUGHT TO EM THE FACT IS POYSER SAID THE SQUIRE IGNORING MISSUS POYSER'S THEORY OF WORLDLY PROSPERITY
2817-142371-0038 NOW THE PLAN I'M THINKING OF IS TO EFFECT A LITTLE EXCHANGE IF YOU WERE TO HAVE THE HOLLOW PASTURES YOU MIGHT INCREASE YOUR DAIRY WHICH MUST BE SO PROFITABLE UNDER YOUR WIFE'S MANAGEMENT AND I SHOULD REQUEST YOU MISSUS POYSER
2817-142371-0039 THAN CORN LAND MISTER POYSER WAS LEANING FORWARD WITH HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND HIS MOUTH SCREWED UP
2817-142371-0040 HE WAS MUCH TOO ACUTE A MAN NOT TO SEE THROUGH THE WHOLE BUSINESS AND TO FORESEE PERFECTLY WHAT WOULD BE HIS WIFE'S VIEW OF THE SUBJECT BUT HE DISLIKED GIVING UNPLEASANT ANSWERS UNLESS IT WAS ON A POINT OF FARMING PRACTICE
2817-142371-0041 HE WOULD RATHER GIVE UP THAN HAVE A QUARREL ANY DAY AND AFTER ALL IT MATTERED MORE TO HIS WIFE THAN TO HIM SO AFTER A FEW MOMENTS SILENCE HE LOOKED UP AT HER AND SAID MILDLY WHAT DOST SAY
2817-142371-0042 MISSUS POYSER HAD HAD HER EYES FIXED ON HER HUSBAND WITH COLD SEVERITY DURING HIS SILENCE BUT NOW SHE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD WITH A TOSS LOOKED ICILY AT THE OPPOSITE ROOF OF THE COW SHED AND SPEARING HER KNITTING TOGETHER WITH THE LOOSE PIN
2817-142371-0043 HELD IT FIRMLY BETWEEN HER CLASPED HANDS SAY WHY I SAY YOU MAY DO AS YOU LIKE
2817-142371-0044 I KNOW THERE'S THEM AS IS BORN T OWN THE LAND AND THEM AS IS BORN TO SWEAT ON'T HERE MISSUS POYSER PAUSED TO GASP A LITTLE AND I KNOW IT'S CHRISTENED FOLKS'S DUTY TO SUBMIT TO THEIR BETTERS AS FUR AS FLESH AND
2817-142371-0045 BLOOD ULL BEAR IT BUT I'LL NOT MAKE A MARTYR O MYSELF AND WEAR MYSELF TO SKIN AND BONE AND WORRET MYSELF AS IF I WAS A CHURN WI BUTTER A COMING IN'T FOR NO LANDLORD IN ENGLAND NOT IF HE WAS KING GEORGE HIMSELF
2817-142371-0046 NO NO MY DEAR MISSUS POYSER CERTAINLY NOT SAID THE SQUIRE STILL CONFIDENT IN HIS OWN POWERS OF PERSUASION YOU MUST NOT OVERWORK YOURSELF
2817-142371-0047 BUT DON'T YOU THINK YOUR WORK WILL RATHER BE LESSENED THAN INCREASED IN THIS WAY THERE IS SO MUCH MILK REQUIRED AT THE ABBEY THAT YOU WILL HAVE LITTLE INCREASE OF CHEESE AND BUTTER MAKING FROM THE ADDITION TO YOUR DAIRY
2817-142371-0048 THAT IT WAS NOT IN THIS CASE A PURELY ABSTRACT QUESTION I DARESAY SAID MISSUS POYSER BITTERLY TURNING HER HEAD HALF WAY TOWARDS HER HUSBAND AND LOOKING AT THE VACANT ARM CHAIR I DARESAY IT'S TRUE FOR MEN
2817-142371-0049 WI INS AN OUTS TO FIT INT EVERYTHING ELSE IF YOU COULD MAKE A PUDDING WI THINKING O THE BATTER IT UD BE EASY GETTING DINNER
2817-142371-0050 WHAT'S TO MAKE ME SURE AS THE HOUSE WON'T BE PUT O BOARD WAGE AFORE WE'RE MANY MONTHS OLDER AND THEN

2817-142371-0052 AND LOSE HALF OF EM WI THE MEASLES AND THERE'S THE FETCHING AND CARRYING AS UD BE WELLY HALF A DAY'S WORK FOR A MAN AN HOSS THAT'S TO BE TOOK OUT O THE PROFITS I RECKON BUT THERE'S FOLKS UD HOLD A SIEVE UNDER THE PUMP
2817-142371-0053 THAT DIFFICULTY ABOUT THE FETCHING AND CARRYING YOU WILL NOT HAVE MISSUS POYSER SAID THE SQUIRE WHO THOUGHT THAT THIS ENTRANCE INTO PARTICULARS INDICATED A DISTANT INCLINATION TO COMPROMISE ON MISSUS POYSER'S PART
2817-142371-0054 BETHELL WILL DO THAT REGULARLY WITH THE CART AND PONY OH SIR BEGGING YOUR PARDON I'VE NEVER BEEN USED T HAVING GENTLEFOLKS'S SERVANTS COMING ABOUT MY BACK PLACES A MAKING LOVE TO BOTH THE GELLS AT ONCE
2817-142371-0055 AND KEEPING EM WITH THEIR HANDS ON THEIR HIPS LISTENING TO ALL MANNER O GOSSIP WHEN THEY SHOULD BE DOWN ON THEIR KNEES A SCOURING IF WE'RE TO GO TO RUIN IT SHANNA BE WI HAVING OUR BACK KITCHEN TURNED INTO A PUBLIC WELL POYSER
2817-142371-0056 AND I SHALL NOT FORGET YOUR READINESS TO ACCOMMODATE YOUR LANDLORD AS WELL AS A NEIGHBOUR I KNOW YOU WILL BE GLAD TO HAVE YOUR LEASE RENEWED FOR THREE YEARS WHEN THE PRESENT ONE EXPIRES OTHERWISE I DARESAY THURLE WHO IS A MAN OF SOME CAPITAL
2817-142371-0057 EVEN WITHOUT THE FINAL THREAT HER HUSBAND REALLY ALARMED AT THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR LEAVING THE OLD PLACE WHERE HE HAD BEEN BRED AND BORN FOR HE BELIEVED THE OLD SQUIRE HAD SMALL SPITE ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING
2817-142371-0058 WAS BEGINNING A MILD REMONSTRANCE EXPLANATORY OF THE INCONVENIENCE HE SHOULD FIND IN HAVING TO BUY AND SELL MORE STOCK WITH
2817-142371-0059 WHEN MISSUS POYSER BURST IN WITH THE DESPERATE DETERMINATION TO HAVE HER SAY OUT THIS ONCE THOUGH IT WERE TO RAIN NOTICES TO QUIT AND THE ONLY SHELTER WERE THE WORK HOUSE THEN SIR IF I MAY SPEAK AS
2817-142371-0060 SIGN HER SOUL AWAY I'VE A RIGHT TO SPEAK FOR I MAKE ONE QUARTER O THE RENT AND SAVE ANOTHER QUARTER
2817-142371-0061 WI THE CELLAR FULL O WATER AND FROGS AND TOADS HOPPIN UP THE STEPS BY DOZENS AND THE FLOORS ROTTEN AND THE RATS AND MICE GNAWING EVERY BIT O CHEESE AND RUNNIN OVER OUR HEADS AS WE LIE BED TILL WE EXPECT EM TO EAT US UP ALIVE
2817-142371-0062 AS IT'S A MERCY THEY HANNA EAT THE CHILDREN LONG AGO
2817-142371-0063 TILL A PLACE TUMBLES DOWN AND NOT THEN ON'Y WI BEGGING AND PRAYING AND HAVING TO PAY HALF AND BEING STRUNG UP WI THE RENT AS IT'S MUCH IF HE GETS ENOUGH OUT O THE LAND TO PAY FOR ALL HE'S PUT HIS OWN MONEY INTO THE GROUND BEFOREHAND SEE
2817-142371-0064 IF YOU'LL GET A STRANGER TO LEAD SUCH A LIFE HERE AS THAT A MAGGOT MUST BE BORN THE ROTTEN CHEESE TO LIKE IT I RECKON YOU MAY RUN AWAY FROM MY WORDS SIR CONTINUED MISSUS POYSER FOLLOWING THE OLD SQUIRE BEYOND THE DOOR
2817-142371-0065 FOR AFTER THE FIRST MOMENTS OF STUNNED SURPRISE HE HAD GOT UP AND WAVING HIS HAND TOWARDS HER WITH A SMILE HAD WALKED OUT TOWARDS HIS PONY BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO GET AWAY IMMEDIATELY FOR JOHN WAS WALKING THE PONY UP AND DOWN THE YARD
2817-142371-0066 AND WAS SOME DISTANCE FROM THE CAUSEWAY WHEN HIS MASTER BECKONED YOU MAY RUN AWAY FROM MY WORDS SIR AND YOU MAY GO SPINNIN UNDERHAND WAYS O DOING US A MISCHIEF FOR YOU'VE GOT OLD HARRY TO YOUR FRIEND THOUGH NOBODY ELSE IS
2817-142371-0067 FOR WANT O KNOWING HOW T UNDO THE TACKLE
2817-142371-0068 AS SPEAKS MY MIND THERE'S PLENTY O THE SAME WAY O THINKING THIS PARISH
2817-142371-0069 FOR YOUR NAME'S NO BETTER THAN A BRIMSTONE MATCH IN EVERYBODY'S NOSE IF IT ISNA TWO THREE OLD FOLKS AS YOU THINK O SAVING YOUR SOUL BY GIVING EM A BIT O FLANNEL AND A DROP O PORRIDGE AN YOU MAY BE RIGHT THINKING IT'LL TAKE BUT LITTLE TO SAVE YOUR SOUL
2817-142371-0070 THERE ARE OCCASIONS ON WHICH TWO SERVANT GIRLS AND A WAGGONER MAY BE A FORMIDABLE AUDIENCE AND AS THE SQUIRE RODE AWAY ON HIS BLACK PONY EVEN THE GIFT OF SHORT SIGHTEDNESS DID NOT PREVENT HIM FROM BEING AWARE THAT MOLLY
2817-142371-0071 AND THE GANDER HISSING AT A SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE PONY'S HEELS CARRIED OUT THE IDEA OF MISSUS POYSER'S SOLO IN AN IMPRESSIVE QUARTET MISSUS POYSER HOWEVER HAD NO SOONER SEEN THE PONY MOVE OFF THAN SHE TURNED ROUND
2817-142371-0072 GAVE THE TWO HILARIOUS DAMSELS A LOOK WHICH DROVE THEM INTO THE BACK KITCHEN AND UNSPEARING HER KNITTING BEGAN TO KNIT AGAIN WITH HER USUAL RAPIDITY AS SHE RE ENTERED THE HOUSE THEE'ST DONE IT NOW SAID MISTER POYSER
2817-142371-0073 A LITTLE ALARMED AND UNEASY BUT NOT WITHOUT SOME TRIUMPHANT AMUSEMENT AT HIS WIFE'S OUTBREAK YES I KNOW I'VE DONE IT SAID MISSUS POYSER
2817-142371-0074 THERE'S NO PLEASURE LIVING IF YOU'RE TO BE CORKED UP FOR EVER AND ONLY DRIBBLE YOUR MIND OUT BY THE SLY LIKE A LEAKY BARREL I SHAN'T REPENT SAYING WHAT I THINK
2817-142371-0075 AND THERE'S LITTLE LIKELIHOOD FOR IT SEEMS AS IF THEM AS AREN'T WANTED HERE ARE TH
2817-142371-0076 THIS MICHAELMAS TWELVEMONTH SAID MISTER POYSER AND GOING INTO A STRANGE PARISH WHERE THEE KNOW'ST NOBODY IT'LL BE HARD UPON US BOTH
2817-142371-0077 THERE'S PLENTY O THINGS MAY HAPPEN BETWEEN THIS AND MICHAELMAS TWELVEMONTH THE CAPTAIN MAY BE MASTER AFORE THEM FOR WHAT WE KNOW SAID MISSUS POYSER INCLINED TO TAKE AN UNUSUALLY HOPEFUL VIEW OF AN EMBARRASSMENT WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY HER OWN MERIT
2817-142371-0078 AND NOT BY OTHER PEOPLE'S FAULT I'M NONE FOR WORRETING SAID MISTER POYSER RISING FROM HIS THREE CORNERED CHAIR AND WALKING SLOWLY TOWARDS THE DOOR
2817-142380-0000 WITH TWO BEDS IN IT ONE LAID ON THE FLOOR IT IS TEN O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND THE DARK WALL OPPOSITE THE WINDOW SHUTS OUT THE MOONLIGHT THAT MIGHT HAVE STRUGGLED WITH THE LIGHT OF THE ONE DIP CANDLE BY WHICH BARTLE MASSEY IS PRETENDING TO READ
2817-142380-0001 THE NEGLECTED BEARD OF A MAN JUST RISEN FROM A SICK BED HIS HEAVY BLACK HAIR HANGS OVER HIS FOREHEAD AND THERE IS NO ACTIVE IMPULSE IN HIM WHICH INCLINES HIM TO PUSH IT OFF THAT HE MAY BE MORE AWAKE TO WHAT IS AROUND HIM
2817-142380-0002 HE HAS ONE ARM OVER THE BACK OF THE CHAIR AND HE SEEMS TO BE LOOKING DOWN AT HIS CLASPED HANDS HE IS ROUSED BY A KNOCK AT THE DOOR
2817-142380-0003 SAID BARTLE MASSEY RISING HASTILY AND UNFASTENING THE DOOR IT WAS MISTER IRWINE ADAM ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR WITH INSTINCTIVE RESPECT AS MISTER IRWINE APPROACHED HIM AND TOOK HIS HAND I'M LATE ADAM
2817-142380-0004 LET US ALL SIT DOWN ADAM TOOK HIS CHAIR AGAIN MECHANICALLY AND BARTLE FOR WHOM THERE WAS NO CHAIR REMAINING SAT ON THE BED IN THE BACKGROUND HAVE YOU SEEN HER SIR
2817-142380-0005 YES ADAM I AND THE CHAPLAIN HAVE BOTH BEEN WITH HER THIS EVENING DID YOU ASK HER SIR DID YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ME YES SAID MISTER IRWINE WITH SOME HESITATION
2817-142380-0006 IT IS NOT ONLY YOU SOME FATAL INFLUENCE SEEMS TO HAVE SHUT UP HER HEART AGAINST HER FELLOW CREATURES SHE HAS SCARCELY SAID ANYTHING MORE THAN NO EITHER TO ME OR THE CHAPLAIN THREE OR FOUR DAYS AGO BEFORE YOU WERE MENTIONED TO HER
2817-142380-0007 WHEN I ASKED HER IF THERE WAS ANY ONE OF HER FAMILY WHOM SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE TO WHOM SHE COULD OPEN HER MIND SHE SAID WITH A VIOLENT SHUDDER TELL THEM NOT TO COME NEAR ME I WON'T SEE ANY OF THEM
2817-142380-0008 IF THEY NOW URGE YOU STRONGLY TO GO AND SEE HER TO MORROW MORNING EVEN WITHOUT HER CONSENT
2817-142380-0009 THAT THE INTERVIEW MIGHT AFFECT HER FAVOURABLY BUT I GRIEVE TO SAY I HAVE SCARCELY ANY HOPE OF THAT SHE DIDN'T SEEM AGITATED WHEN I MENTIONED YOUR NAME SHE ONLY SAID NO IN THE SAME COLD OBSTINATE WAY AS USUAL
2817-142380-0010 AND IF THE MEETING HAD NO GOOD EFFECT ON HER IT WOULD BE PURE USELESS SUFFERING TO YOU SEVERE SUFFERING I FEAR SHE IS VERY MUCH CHANGED ADAM STARTED UP FROM HIS CHAIR
2817-142380-0011 AND SEIZED HIS HAT WHICH LAY ON THE TABLE BUT HE STOOD STILL THEN AND LOOKED AT MISTER IRWINE AS IF HE HAD A QUESTION TO ASK WHICH IT WAS YET DIFFICULT TO UTTER BARTLE MASSEY ROSE QUIETLY TURNED THE KEY IN THE DOOR
2817-142380-0012 AND PUT IT IN HIS POCKET IS HE COME BACK SAID ADAM AT LAST NO HE IS NOT SAID MISTER IRWINE QUIETLY LAY DOWN YOUR HAT ADAM UNLESS YOU LIKE TO WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A LITTLE FRESH AIR
2817-142380-0013 I FEAR YOU HAVE NOT BEEN OUT AGAIN TO DAY YOU NEEDN'T DECEIVE ME SIR SAID ADAM LOOKING HARD AT MISTER IRWINE AND SPEAKING IN A TONE OF ANGRY SUSPICION YOU NEEDN'T BE AFRAID OF ME I ONLY WANT JUSTICE
2817-142380-0014 I WANT HIM TO FEEL WHAT SHE FEELS IT'S HIS WORK SHE WAS A CHILD AS IT UD HA GONE T ANYBODY'S HEART TO LOOK AT I DON'T CARE WHAT SHE'S DONE IT WAS HIM BROUGHT HER TO IT AND HE SHALL KNOW IT HE SHALL FEEL IT
2817-142380-0015 TO SIN AND MISERY I'M NOT DECEIVING YOU ADAM SAID MISTER IRWINE ARTHUR DONNITHORNE IS NOT COME BACK WAS NOT COME BACK WHEN I LEFT I HAVE LEFT A LETTER FOR HIM HE WILL KNOW
2817-142380-0016 HE WILL KNOW HE WILL SUFFER LONG AND BITTERLY HE HAS A HEART AND A CONSCIENCE I CAN'T BE ENTIRELY DECEIVED IN HIS CHARACTER I AM CONVINCED
2817-142380-0017 HE MAY BE WEAK BUT HE IS NOT CALLOUS NOT COLDLY SELFISH I AM PERSUADED
2817-142380-0018 ALL HIS LIFE WHY DO YOU CRAVE VENGEANCE IN THIS WAY NO AMOUNT OF TORTURE THAT YOU COULD INFLICT ON HIM COULD BENEFIT HER NO O GOD NO ADAM GROANED OUT SINKING ON HIS CHAIR AGAIN
2817-142380-0019 BUT THEN THAT'S THE DEEPEST CURSE OF ALL THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE BLACKNESS OF IT IT CAN NEVER BE UNDONE MY POOR HETTY SHE CAN NEVER BE MY SWEET HETTY AGAIN THE PRETTIEST THING GOD HAD MADE
2817-142380-0020 SMILING UP AT ME I THOUGHT SHE LOVED ME AND WAS GOOD ADAM'S VOICE HAD BEEN GRADUALLY SINKING INTO A HOARSE UNDERTONE AS IF HE WERE ONLY TALKING TO HIMSELF BUT NOW HE SAID ABRUPTLY LOOKING AT MISTER IRWINE
2817-142380-0021 BUT SHE ISN'T AS GUILTY AS THEY SAY YOU DON'T THINK SHE IS SIR SHE CAN'T HA DONE IT THAT PERHAPS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY ADAM MISTER IRWINE ANSWERED GENTLY
2817-142380-0022 IN THESE CASES WE SOMETIMES FORM OUR JUDGMENT ON WHAT SEEMS TO US STRONG EVIDENCE AND YET FOR WANT OF KNOWING SOME SMALL FACT OUR JUDGMENT IS WRONG BUT SUPPOSE THE WORST YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY
2817-142380-0023 THAT THE GUILT OF HER CRIME LIES WITH HIM AND THAT HE OUGHT TO BEAR THE PUNISHMENT IT IS NOT FOR US MEN TO APPORTION THE SHARES OF MORAL GUILT AND RETRIBUTION WE FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID MISTAKES
2817-142380-0024 EVEN IN DETERMINING WHO HAS COMMITTED A SINGLE CRIMINAL ACT AND THE PROBLEM
2817-142380-0025 YOU HAVE A MIND THAT CAN UNDERSTAND THIS FULLY ADAM WHEN YOU ARE CALM DON'T SUPPOSE I CAN'T ENTER INTO THE ANGUISH THAT DRIVES YOU INTO THIS STATE OF REVENGEFUL HATRED BUT
2817-142380-0026 FOR IT IS PASSION AND YOU DECEIVE YOURSELF IN CALLING IT JUSTICE IT MIGHT BE WITH YOU PRECISELY AS IT HAS BEEN WITH ARTHUR NAY WORSE YOUR PASSION MIGHT LEAD YOU YOURSELF INTO A HORRIBLE CRIME
2817-142380-0027 NO NOT WORSE SAID ADAM BITTERLY I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S WORSE I'D SOONER DO IT I'D SOONER DO A WICKEDNESS AS I COULD SUFFER FOR BY MYSELF THAN HA BROUGHT HER TO DO WICKEDNESS
2817-142380-0028 AND THEN STAND BY AND SEE EM PUNISH HER WHILE THEY LET ME ALONE AND ALL FOR A BIT O PLEASURE AS IF HE'D HAD A MAN'S HEART IN HIM HE'D HA CUT HIS HAND OFF SOONER THAN HE'D HA TAKEN IT WHAT IF HE DIDN'T FORESEE WHAT'S HAPPENED
2817-142380-0029 HE FORESAW ENOUGH HE'D NO RIGHT TO EXPECT ANYTHING BUT HARM AND SHAME TO HER
2817-142380-0030 NOT HALF SO HATEFUL AS THAT LET A MAN DO WHAT HE WILL IF HE KNOWS HE'S TO BEAR THE PUNISHMENT HIMSELF
2817-142380-0031 AND KNOWS ALL THE WHILE THE PUNISHMENT LL FALL ON SOMEBODY ELSE THERE AGAIN YOU PARTLY DECEIVE YOURSELF ADAM THERE IS NO SORT OF WRONG DEED OF WHICH A MAN CAN BEAR THE PUNISHMENT ALONE YOU CAN'T ISOLATE YOURSELF
2817-142380-0032 I FEEL THE TERRIBLE EXTENT OF SUFFERING THIS SIN OF ARTHUR'S HAS CAUSED TO OTHERS BUT SO DOES EVERY SIN CAUSE SUFFERING TO OTHERS BESIDES THOSE WHO COMMIT IT AN ACT OF VENGEANCE ON YOUR PART AGAINST ARTHUR WOULD SIMPLY BE ANOTHER EVIL
2817-142380-0033 ADDED TO THOSE WE ARE SUFFERING UNDER YOU COULD NOT BEAR THE PUNISHMENT ALONE YOU WOULD ENTAIL THE WORST SORROWS ON EVERY ONE WHO LOVES YOU YOU WOULD HAVE COMMITTED AN ACT OF BLIND FURY THAT WOULD LEAVE ALL THE PRESENT EVILS JUST AS THEY WERE
2817-142380-0034 AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT SEE THAT TO FIX YOUR MIND ON ARTHUR'S PUNISHMENT IS REVENGE AND NOT JUSTICE YOU ARE IN DANGER OF BEING LED ON TO THE COMMISSION OF SOME GREAT WRONG REMEMBER WHAT YOU TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS
2817-142380-0035 AFTER YOU HAD GIVEN THAT BLOW TO ARTHUR IN THE GROVE ADAM WAS SILENT THE LAST WORDS HAD CALLED UP A VIVID IMAGE OF THE PAST AND MISTER IRWINE LEFT HIM TO HIS THOUGHTS
2817-142380-0036 WHILE HE SPOKE TO BARTLE MASSEY ABOUT OLD MISTER DONNITHORNE'S FUNERAL AND OTHER MATTERS OF AN INDIFFERENT KIND BUT AT LENGTH ADAM TURNED ROUND AND SAID IN A MORE SUBDUED TONE
2817-142380-0037 IS DINAH MORRIS COME TO EM SIR SETH SAID THEY'D SENT FOR HER NO MISTER POYSER TELLS ME SHE WAS NOT COME WHEN HE LEFT THEY'RE AFRAID THE LETTER HAS NOT REACHED HER
2817-142380-0038 IT SEEMS THEY HAD NO EXACT ADDRESS ADAM SAT RUMINATING A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN SAID
2817-142380-0039 BUT PERHAPS THE POYSERS
2817-142380-0040 SINCE THEY WON'T COME NIGH HER THEMSELVES BUT I THINK SHE WOULD FOR THE METHODISTS ARE GREAT FOLKS FOR GOING INTO THE PRISONS AND SETH SAID HE THOUGHT SHE WOULD SHE'D A VERY TENDER WAY WITH HER DINAH HAD
2817-142380-0041 YOU NEVER SAW HER SIR DID YOU YES I DID I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH HER SHE PLEASED ME A GOOD DEAL AND NOW YOU MENTION IT I WISH SHE WOULD COME FOR IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A GENTLE MILD WOMAN LIKE HER
2817-142380-0042 IF I'D THOUGHT OF IT EARLIER I WOULD HAVE TAKEN SOME MEASURES FOR FINDING HER OUT SAID MISTER IRWINE BUT IT'S TOO LATE NOW I FEAR WELL ADAM I MUST GO NOW TRY TO GET SOME REST TO NIGHT

2836-5354-0002 WHEN A HIGH PRINCIPLED GENTLEWOMAN FALLS FROM HER PEDESTAL NEVER HAD SHE EXPERIENCED A MOMENT'S CALM OR PEACE OR HAPPINESS SINCE THE FATAL NIGHT OF QUITTING HER HOME SHE HAD TAKEN A BLIND LEAP IN A MOMENT OF WILD PASSION
2836-5354-0003 WHEN INSTEAD OF THE GARDEN OF ROSES IT HAD BEEN HER PERSUADER'S PLEASURE TO PROMISE HER SHE WOULD FALL INTO BUT WHICH IN TRUTH SHE HAD BARELY GLANCED AT FOR THAT HAD NOT BEEN HER MOVING MOTIVE
2836-5354-0004 SHE HAD FOUND HERSELF PLUNGED INTO A YAWNING ABYSS OF HORROR FROM WHICH THERE WAS NEVER MORE ANY ESCAPE NEVER MORE NEVER MORE THE VERY INSTANT THE VERY NIGHT OF HER DEPARTURE SHE AWOKE TO WHAT SHE HAD DONE THE GUILT
2836-5354-0005 WHOSE ASPECT HAD BEEN SHUNNED IN THE PROSPECTIVE ASSUMED AT ONCE ITS TRUE FRIGHTFUL COLOR THE BLACKNESS OF DARKNESS AND A LIVELY REMORSE A NEVER DYING ANGUISH TOOK POSSESSION OF HER SOUL FOREVER OH READER BELIEVE ME
2836-5354-0006 LADY WIFE MOTHER SHOULD YOU EVER BE TEMPTED TO ABANDON YOUR HOME SO WILL YOU AWAKE WHATEVER TRIALS MAY BE THE LOT OF YOUR MARRIED LIFE THOUGH THEY MAY MAGNIFY THEMSELVES TO YOUR CRUSHED SPIRIT AS BEYOND THE NATURE

2836-5354-0050 SHE HAD HAD A LONG ILLNESS TERMINATING IN A LOW FEVER
2836-5354-0051 THAT MILADI WOULD SOON GET ABOUT IF SHE WOULD ONLY ROUSE HERSELF SHE HAD GOT SO FAR ABOUT AS TO SIT UP IN THE WINDY CHAMBER AND IT SEEMED TO BE TO HER A MATTER OF PERFECT INDIFFERENCE WHETHER SHE EVER GOT OUT OF IT

2836-5355-0004 YOUR WORDS ARE NOT WORDS OF TRUTH BUT OF DECEIT YOU DID NOT INTEND TO BE BACK IN TIME FOR THE MARRIAGE
2836-5355-0005 WHAT FANCIES YOU DO TAKE UP UTTERED FRANCIS LEVISON SOME TIME SUBSEQUENT TO YOUR DEPARTURE SHE QUIETLY WENT ON ONE OF THE MAIDS WAS SETTING TO RIGHTS THE CLOTHES IN YOUR DRESSING CLOSET AND SHE BROUGHT ME A LETTER SHE FOUND IN ONE OF THE POCKETS
2836-5355-0006 I SAW BY THE DATE THAT IT WAS ONE OF THOSE TWO WHICH YOU RECEIVED ON THE MORNING OF YOUR DEPARTURE IT CONTAINED THE INFORMATION THAT THE DIVORCE WAS PRONOUNCED SHE SPOKE SO QUIETLY SO APPARENTLY WITHOUT FEELING OR PASSION THAT SIR FRANCIS WAS AGREEABLY ASTONISHED
2836-5355-0007 HE SHOULD HAVE LESS TROUBLE IN THROWING OFF THE MASK BUT HE WAS AN ILL TEMPERED MAN AND TO HEAR THAT THE LETTER HAD BEEN FOUND TO HAVE THE FALSENESS OF HIS FINE PROTESTATIONS AND PROMISES LAID BARE DID NOT IMPROVE HIS TEMPER NOW LADY ISABEL CONTINUED
2836-5355-0008 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO HAVE UNDECEIVED ME THEN TO HAVE TOLD ME THAT THE HOPES I WAS CHERISHING FOR THE SAKE OF THE UNBORN CHILD WERE WORSE THAN VAIN I DID NOT JUDGE SO HE REPLIED THE EXCITED STATE YOU THEN APPEARED TO BE IN
2836-5355-0009 WOULD HAVE PRECLUDED YOUR LISTENING TO ANY SORT OF REASON HER HEART BEAT A LITTLE QUICKER BUT SHE STILLED IT YOU DEEM THAT IT WAS NOT IN REASON THAT I SHOULD ASPIRE TO BE THE WIFE OF SIR FRANCIS LEVISON HE ROSE AND BEGAN KICKING AT THE LOGS WITH THE HEEL OF HIS BOOT THIS TIME
2836-5355-0010 WELL ISABEL YOU MUST BE AWARE THAT IT IS AN AWFUL SACRIFICE FOR A MAN IN MY POSITION TO MARRY A DIVORCED WOMAN THE HECTIC FLUSHED INTO HER THIN CHEEKS BUT HER VOICE SOUNDED CALM AS BEFORE
2836-5355-0011 WHEN I EXPECTED OR WISHED FOR THE SACRIFICE IT WAS NOT FOR MY OWN SAKE I TOLD YOU SO THEN BUT IT WAS NOT MADE AND THE CHILD'S INHERITANCE IS THAT OF SIN AND SHAME THERE HE LIES SIR FRANCIS HALF TURNED TO WHERE SHE POINTED
2836-5355-0012 AND SAW AN INFANT'S CRADLE BY THE SIDE OF THE BED HE DID NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE TO LOOK AT IT I AM THE REPRESENTATIVE NOW OF AN ANCIENT AND RESPECTED BARONETCY HE RESUMED IN A TONE AS OF APOLOGY FOR HIS PREVIOUS HEARTLESS WORDS
2836-5355-0013 AND TO MAKE YOU MY WIFE WOULD SO OFFEND ALL MY FAMILY THAT STAY INTERRUPTED LADY ISABEL YOU NEED NOT TROUBLE YOURSELF TO FIND NEEDLESS EXCUSES HAD YOU TAKEN THIS JOURNEY FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING ME YOUR WIFE WERE YOU TO PROPOSE TO DO SO THIS DAY
2836-5355-0014 AND BRING A CLERGYMAN INTO THE ROOM TO PERFORM THE CEREMONY IT WOULD BE FUTILE THE INJURY TO THE CHILD CAN NEVER BE REPAIRED AND FOR MYSELF I CANNOT IMAGINE ANY FATE IN LIFE WORSE THAN BEING COMPELLED TO PASS IT WITH YOU
2836-5355-0015 IF YOU HAVE TAKEN THIS AVERSION TO ME IT CANNOT BE HELPED HE COLDLY SAID INWARDLY CONGRATULATING HIMSELF LET US NOT DOUBT AT BEING SPARED THE WORK OF TROUBLE HE HAD ANTICIPATED YOU MADE COMMOTION ENOUGH ONCE ABOUT ME MAKING YOU REPARATION
2836-5355-0016 SHE SHOOK HER HEAD ALL THE REPARATION IN YOUR POWER TO MAKE ALL THE REPARATION THAT THE WHOLE WORLD CAN INVENT COULD NOT UNDO MY SIN IT AND THE EFFECTS MUST LIE UPON ME FOREVER OH SIN WAS THE DERISIVE EXCLAMATION
2836-5355-0017 YOU LADIES SHOULD THINK OF THAT BEFOREHAND YES SHE SADLY ANSWERED MAY HEAVEN HELP ALL TO DO SO WHO MAY BE TEMPTED AS I WAS IF YOU MEAN THAT AS A REPROACH TO ME IT'S RATHER OUT OF PLACE CHAFED SIR FRANCIS
2836-5355-0018 WHOSE FITS OF ILL TEMPER WERE UNDER NO CONTROL AND WHO NEVER WHEN IN THEM CARED WHAT HE SAID TO OUTRAGE THE FEELINGS OF ANOTHER THE TEMPTATION TO SIN AS YOU CALL IT LAY NOT IN MY PERSUASIONS HALF SO MUCH AS IN YOUR JEALOUS ANGER TOWARD YOUR HUSBAND
2836-5355-0019 QUITE TRUE WAS HER REPLY AND I BELIEVE YOU WERE ON THE WRONG SCENT ISABEL IF IT WILL BE ANY SATISFACTION TO YOU TO HEAR IT SINCE WE ARE MUTUALLY ON THIS COMPLIMENTARY DISCOURSE IT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO SMOOTH OVER FACTS
2836-5355-0020 I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WOULD IMPLY SHE SAID DRAWING HER SHAWL ROUND HER WITH A FRESH SHIVER HOW ON THE WRONG SCENT WITH REGARD TO YOUR HUSBAND AND THAT HARE GIRL YOU WERE BLINDLY OUTRAGEOUSLY JEALOUS OF HIM GO ON
2836-5355-0021 AND I SAY I THINK YOU ARE ON THE WRONG SCENT I DO NOT BELIEVE MISTER CARLYLE EVER THOUGHT OF THE GIRL IN THAT WAY WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE GASPED THEY HAD A SECRET BETWEEN THEM NOT OF LOVE A SECRET OF BUSINESS AND THOSE INTERVIEWS THEY HAD TOGETHER
2836-5355-0022 HER DANCING ATTENDANCE UPON HIM PERPETUALLY RELATED TO THAT AND THAT ALONE HER FACE WAS MORE FLUSHED THAN IT HAD BEEN THROUGHOUT THE INTERVIEW HE SPOKE QUIETLY NOW QUITE IN AN EQUAL TONE OF REASONING IT WAS HIS WAY WHEN THE ILL TEMPER WAS UPON HIM
2836-5355-0023 AND THE CALMER HE SPOKE THE MORE CUTTING WERE HIS WORDS HE NEED NOT HAVE TOLD HER THIS WHAT WAS THE SECRET SHE INQUIRED IN A LOW TONE NAY I CAN'T EXPLAIN ALL THEY DID NOT TAKE ME INTO THEIR CONFIDENCE THEY DID NOT EVEN TAKE YOU
2836-5355-0024 AND CARLYLE WAS ACTING IN IT UNDER THE ROSE FOR MISSUS HARE SHE COULD NOT SEEK OUT CARLYLE HERSELF SO SHE SENT THE YOUNG LADY THAT'S ALL I KNOW HOW DID YOU KNOW IT I HAD REASON TO THINK SO
2836-5355-0025 WHAT REASON I MUST REQUEST YOU TO TELL ME I OVERHEARD SCRAPS OF THEIR CONVERSATION NOW AND THEN IN THOSE MEETINGS AND SO GATHERED MY INFORMATION YOU TOLD A DIFFERENT TALE TO ME SIR FRANCIS WAS HER REMARK

2836-5355-0046 I WISH YOU A GOOD DAY SO YOU WILL NOT EVEN SHAKE HANDS WITH ME ISABEL I WOULD PREFER NOT AND THUS THEY PARTED SIR FRANCIS LEFT THE ROOM BUT NOT IMMEDIATELY THE HOUSE HE WENT INTO A DISTANT APARTMENT
2836-5355-0047 AND CALLING THE SERVANTS BEFORE HIM THERE WERE BUT TWO GAVE THEM EACH A YEAR'S WAGES IN ADVANCE
2836-5355-0048 THEN HE PAID A VISIT TO THE LANDLORD AND HANDED HIM LIKEWISE A YEAR'S RENT IN ADVANCE MAKING THE SAME REMARK AFTER THAT HE ORDERED DINNER AT A HOTEL AND THE SAME NIGHT HE AND PIERRE DEPARTED ON THEIR JOURNEY HOME AGAIN
2836-5355-0049 SIR FRANCIS THANKING HIS LUCKY STAR THAT HE HAD SO EASILY GOT RID OF A VEXATIOUS ANNOYANCE AND LADY ISABEL SHE PASSED HER EVENING ALONE SITTING IN THE SAME PLACE CLOSE TO THE FIRE AND THE SPARKS
2836-5355-0050 INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM WHEN LADY ISABEL LAY DOWN TO REST SHE SANK INTO A SOMEWHAT CALMER SLEEP THAN SHE HAD KNOWN OF LATE ALSO INTO A DREAM SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS BACK AT EAST LYNNE NOT BACK IN ONE SENSE
2836-5355-0051 BUT THAT SHE SEEMED NEVER TO HAVE GONE AWAY FROM IT WALKING IN THE FLOWER GARDEN WITH MISTER CARLYLE WHILE THE THREE CHILDREN PLAYED ON THE LAWN HER ARM WAS WITHIN HER HUSBAND'S AND HE WAS RELATING SOMETHING TO HER WHAT THE NEWS WAS SHE COULD NOT REMEMBER AFTERWARD
2836-5355-0052 EXCEPTING THAT IT WAS CONNECTED WITH THE OFFICE AND OLD MISTER DILL AND THAT MISTER CARLYLE LAUGHED WHEN HE TOLD IT THEY APPEARED TO BE INTERRUPTED BY THE CRYING OF ARCHIBALD AND IN TURNING TO THE LAWN TO ASK WHAT WAS THE MATTER SHE AWOKE
2836-5355-0053 ALAS IT WAS THE ACTUAL CRYING OF HER OWN CHILD WHICH AWOKE HER THIS LAST CHILD THE ILL FATED LITTLE BEING IN THE CRADLE BESIDE HER
2843-152918-0000 THEY HAD UNDERGONE A REMARKABLE CHANGE SINCE OUR ARRIVAL AT THE BUTCHER'S SHOP THEY NOW WANDERED ABOUT FAT SLEEK AND CONTENTED AND THEIR FORMER VORACITY HAD COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED
2843-152918-0001 AS REGARDS OURSELVES A DAY OR TWO LONGER MADE NO DIFFERENCE OUR MOST IMPORTANT ARTICLE OF DIET THE PEMMICAN WAS PRACTICALLY LEFT UNTOUCHED AS FOR THE TIME BEING DOG HAD COMPLETELY TAKEN ITS PLACE
2843-152918-0002 THERE WAS THUS NO GREAT SIGN OF DEPRESSION TO BE NOTICED WHEN WE CAME BACK INTO THE TENT AFTER FINISHING OUR WORK AND HAD TO WHILE AWAY THE TIME AS I WENT IN I COULD DESCRY WISTING A LITTLE WAY OFF KNEELING ON THE GROUND
2843-152918-0003 AND ENGAGED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF CUTLETS THE DOGS STOOD IN A RING ROUND HIM AND LOOKED ON WITH INTEREST THE NORTH EAST WIND WHISTLED AND HOWLED THE AIR WAS THICK WITH DRIVING SNOW AND WISTING WAS NOT TO BE ENVIED
2843-152918-0004 TO WHATEVER AGE I MAY LIVE IN THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT THE WIND HAD GONE BACK TO THE NORTH AND INCREASED TO A GALE IT WAS BLOWING AND SNOWING SO THAT WHEN WE CAME OUT IN THE MORNING WE COULD NOT SEE THE SLEDGES THEY WERE HALF SNOWED UNDER
2843-152918-0005 THE TEMPERATURE WAS NOT SO VERY LOW
2843-152918-0006 WE HAD ALL TAKEN A TURN OUTSIDE TO LOOK AT THE WEATHER AND WERE SITTING ON OUR SLEEPING BAGS DISCUSSING THE POOR PROSPECT IT'S THE DEVIL'S OWN WEATHER HERE AT THE BUTCHER'S SAID ONE IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT WOULD NEVER GET ANY BETTER
2843-152918-0007 THIS IS THE FIFTH DAY AND IT'S BLOWING WORSE THAN EVER WE ALL AGREED THERE'S NOTHING SO BAD AS LYING WEATHER BOUND LIKE THIS CONTINUED ANOTHER IT TAKES MORE OUT OF YOU THAN GOING FROM MORNING TO NIGHT PERSONALLY I WAS OF THE SAME OPINION
2843-152918-0008 ONE DAY MAY BE PLEASANT ENOUGH BUT TWO THREE FOUR
2843-152918-0009 NO IT WAS AWFUL SHALL WE TRY IT NO SOONER WAS THE PROPOSAL SUBMITTED THAN IT WAS ACCEPTED UNANIMOUSLY AND WITH ACCLAMATION WHEN I THINK OF MY FOUR FRIENDS OF THE SOUTHERN JOURNEY
2843-152918-0010 IT IS THE MEMORY OF THAT MORNING THAT COMES FIRST TO MY MIND ALL THE QUALITIES THAT I MOST ADMIRE IN A MAN WERE CLEARLY SHOWN AT THAT JUNCTURE COURAGE AND DAUNTLESSNESS WITHOUT BOASTING OR BIG WORDS
2843-152918-0011 AMID JOKING AND CHAFF EVERYTHING WAS PACKED AND THEN OUT INTO THE BLIZZARD IT WAS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP ONE'S EYES OPEN THE FINE DRIFT SNOW PENETRATED EVERYWHERE
2843-152918-0012 THE DOGS WERE NOT MUCH INCLINED TO START AND IT TOOK TIME TO GET THEM INTO THEIR HARNESS BUT AT LAST WE WERE READY ONE MORE GLANCE OVER THE CAMPING GROUND TO SEE THAT NOTHING WE OUGHT TO HAVE WITH US HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN
2843-152918-0013 WHICH WE NOW THOUGHT WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED WERE LEFT BEHIND THE LAST THING TO BE DONE WAS PLANTING A BROKEN SKI UPRIGHT BY THE SIDE OF THE DEPOT IT WAS WISTING WHO DID THIS THINKING PRESUMABLY THAT AN EXTRA MARK WOULD DO NO HARM
2843-152918-0014 THAT IT WAS A HAPPY THOUGHT THE FUTURE WILL SHOW AND THEN WE WERE OFF IT WAS A HARD PULL TO BEGIN WITH BOTH FOR MEN AND BEASTS AS THE HIGH SASTRUGI CONTINUED TOWARDS THE SOUTH
2843-152918-0015 AND MADE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ADVANCE THOSE WHO HAD SLEDGES TO DRIVE HAD TO BE VERY ATTENTIVE AND SUPPORT THEM SO THAT THEY DID NOT CAPSIZE ON THE BIG WAVES AND WE WHO HAD NO SLEDGES FOUND GREAT DIFFICULTY IN KEEPING OUR FEET
2843-152918-0016 AS WE HAD NOTHING TO LEAN AGAINST WE WENT ON LIKE THIS SLOWLY ENOUGH BUT THE MAIN THING WAS THAT WE MADE PROGRESS THE GROUND AT FIRST GAVE ONE THE IMPRESSION OF RISING THOUGH NOT MUCH THE GOING WAS EXTREMELY HEAVY
2843-152918-0017 IT WAS LIKE DRAGGING ONESELF THROUGH SAND MEANWHILE THE SASTRUGI GREW SMALLER AND SMALLER AND FINALLY THEY DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER AND THE SURFACE BECAME QUITE FLAT THE GOING ALSO IMPROVED BY DEGREES
2843-152918-0018 FOR WHAT REASON IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY AS THE STORM CONTINUED UNABATED AND THE DRIFT NOW COMBINED WITH FALLING SNOW WAS THICKER THAN EVER IT WAS ALL THE DRIVER COULD DO TO SEE HIS OWN DOGS THE SURFACE
2843-152918-0019 WHICH HAD BECOME PERFECTLY LEVEL HAD THE APPEARANCE AT TIMES OF SINKING IN ANY CASE ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SO FROM THE PACE OF THE SLEDGES NOW AND AGAIN THE DOGS WOULD SET OFF SUDDENLY AT A GALLOP THE WIND AFT NO DOUBT HELPED THE PACE SOMEWHAT
2843-152918-0020 BUT IT ALONE COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE CHANGE I DID NOT LIKE THIS TENDENCY OF THE GROUND TO FALL AWAY IN MY OPINION WE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE WITH ANYTHING OF THAT SORT AFTER REACHING THE HEIGHT AT WHICH WE WERE A SLIGHT SLOPE UPWARD
2843-152918-0021 POSSIBLY BUT DOWN NO THAT DID NOT AGREE WITH MY RECKONING SO FAR THE INCLINE HAD NOT BEEN SO GREAT AS TO CAUSE UNEASINESS BUT IF IT SERIOUSLY BEGAN TO GO DOWNHILL WE SHOULD HAVE TO STOP AND CAMP
2843-152918-0022 WOULD BE MADNESS WE MIGHT RISK FALLING INTO SOME CHASM BEFORE WE HAD TIME TO PULL UP HANSSEN AS USUAL WAS DRIVING FIRST STRICTLY SPEAKING I SHOULD NOW HAVE BEEN GOING IN ADVANCE BUT THE UNEVEN SURFACE AT THE START
2843-152918-0023 AND THE RAPID PACE AFTERWARDS HAD MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO WALK AS FAST THE DOGS COULD PULL I WAS THEREFORE FOLLOWING BY THE SIDE OF WISTING'S SLEDGE AND CHATTING WITH HIM SUDDENLY I SAW HANSSEN'S DOGS SHOOT AHEAD
2843-152918-0024 AND DOWNHILL THEY WENT AT THE WILDEST PACE WISTING AFTER THEM I SHOUTED TO HANSSEN TO STOP
2843-152918-0025 BY TWISTING HIS SLEDGE THE OTHERS WHO WERE FOLLOWING STOPPED WHEN THEY CAME UP TO HIM WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FAIRLY STEEP DESCENT WHAT THERE MIGHT BE BELOW WAS NOT EASY TO DECIDE NOR WOULD WE TRY TO FIND OUT IN THAT WEATHER
2843-152918-0026 WE TRAMPLED DOWN A PLACE FOR THE TENT IN THE LOOSE SNOW AND SOON GOT IT UP IT WAS NOT A LONG DAY'S MARCH THAT WE HAD DONE ELEVEN AND THREE QUARTER MILES BUT WE HAD PUT AN END TO OUR STAY AT THE BUTCHER'S SHOP AND THAT WAS A GREAT THING
2843-152918-0027 THE BOILING POINT TEST THAT EVENING SHOWED THAT WE WERE TEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE SEA AND THAT WE HAD THUS GONE DOWN SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FEET FROM THE BUTCHER'S WE TURNED IN AND WENT TO SLEEP AS SOON AS IT BRIGHTENED
2843-152918-0028 ONE HAS TO SEIZE EVERY OPPORTUNITY IN THESE REGIONS IF ONE NEGLECTS TO DO SO IT MAY MEAN A LONG WAIT AND MUCH MAY BE LOST WE THEREFORE ALL SLEPT WITH ONE EYE OPEN
2843-152918-0029 AND WE KNEW WELL THAT NOTHING COULD HAPPEN WITHOUT OUR NOTICING IT AT THREE IN THE MORNING THE SUN CUT THROUGH THE CLOUDS AND WE THROUGH THE TENT DOOR TO TAKE IN THE SITUATION WAS MORE THAN THE WORK OF A MOMENT
2843-152918-0030 THE SUN SHOWED AS YET LIKE A PAT OF BUTTER AND HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN DISPERSING THE THICK MISTS THE WIND HAD DROPPED SOMEWHAT BUT WAS STILL FAIRLY STRONG THIS IS AFTER ALL THE WORST PART OF ONE'S JOB
2843-152918-0031 TURNING OUT OF ONE'S GOOD WARM SLEEPING BAG AND STANDING OUTSIDE FOR SOME TIME IN THIN CLOTHES WATCHING THE WEATHER WE KNEW BY EXPERIENCE THAT A GLEAM LIKE THIS A CLEARING IN THE WEATHER MIGHT COME SUDDENLY AND THEN ONE HAD TO BE ON THE SPOT
2843-152918-0032 THE GLEAM CAME IT DID NOT LAST LONG BUT LONG ENOUGH WE LAY ON THE SIDE OF A RIDGE THAT FELL AWAY PRETTY STEEPLY THE DESCENT ON THE SOUTH WAS TOO ABRUPT BUT ON THE SOUTH EAST IT WAS BETTER AND MORE GRADUAL
2843-152918-0033 AND ENDED IN A WIDE LEVEL TRACT WE COULD SEE NO CREVASSES OR UNPLEASANTNESS OF ANY KIND IT WAS NOT VERY FAR THAT WE COULD SEE THOUGH ONLY OUR NEAREST SURROUNDINGS OF THE MOUNTAINS WE SAW NOTHING
2843-152918-0034 HAD NOW BROKEN LOOSE AGAIN AND THE NORTH EASTER WAS DOING ALL IT COULD
2843-152918-0035 SINCE WE HAD DISCOVERED THE NATURE OF OUR IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS IF WE ONCE GOT DOWN TO THE PLAIN WE KNEW THAT WE COULD ALWAYS FEEL OUR WAY ON AFTER PUTTING AMPLE BRAKES ON THE SLEDGE RUNNERS
2843-152918-0036 WE STARTED OFF DOWNHILL IN A SOUTH EASTERLY DIRECTION THE SLIGHT IDEA OF THE POSITION THAT WE HAD BEEN ABLE TO GET IN THE MORNING PROVED CORRECT THE DESCENT WAS EASY AND SMOOTH AND WE REACHED THE PLAIN WITHOUT ANY ADVENTURE
2843-152918-0037 WE COULD NOW ONCE MORE SET OUR FACES TO THE SOUTH AND IN THICK DRIVING SNOW WE CONTINUED OUR WAY INTO THE UNKNOWN WITH GOOD ASSISTANCE FROM THE HOWLING NORTH EASTERLY GALE WE NOW RECOMMENCED THE ERECTION OF BEACONS
2843-152918-0038 WHICH HAD NOT BEEN NECESSARY DURING THE ASCENT
2843-152918-0039 THE LAST OF THEM THAT WE ENCOUNTERED THE SURFACE WAS NOW FINE ENOUGH SMOOTH AS A FLOOR AND WITHOUT A SIGN OF SASTRUGI IF OUR PROGRESS WAS NEVERTHELESS SLOW AND DIFFICULT THIS WAS DUE TO THE WRETCHED GOING
2843-152918-0040 WHICH WAS REAL TORTURE TO ALL OF US A SLEDGE JOURNEY THROUGH THE SAHARA COULD NOT HAVE OFFERED A WORSE SURFACE TO MOVE OVER
2843-152918-0041 THE WEATHER IMPROVED IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY AND WHEN WE CAMPED IN THE AFTERNOON IT LOOKED QUITE SMILING THE SUN CAME THROUGH AND GAVE A DELIGHTFUL WARMTH AFTER THE LAST FEW BITTER DAYS IT WAS NOT YET CLEAR
2843-152918-0042 SO THAT WE COULD SEE NOTHING OF OUR SURROUNDINGS THE DISTANCE ACCORDING TO OUR THREE SLEDGE METERS WAS EIGHTEEN AND A HALF MILES TAKING THE BAD GOING INTO CONSIDERATION WE HAD REASON TO BE WELL SATISFIED WITH IT
2843-152918-0043 OUR ALTITUDE CAME OUT AT NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE FEET ABOVE THE SEA OR A DROP OF EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE FEET IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY THIS SURPRISED ME GREATLY WHAT DID IT MEAN
2843-152918-0044 INSTEAD OF RISING GRADUALLY WE WERE GOING SLOWLY DOWN
2843-152918-0045 BUT WHAT ACCORDING TO DEAD RECKONING OUR LATITUDE THAT EVENING
2843-152918-0046 THE NIGHT WAS FILLED WITH SHARP GUSTS FROM THE NORTH THE MORNING CAME WITH A SLACK WIND BUT ACCOMPANIED BY MIST AND SNOWFALL THIS WAS ABOMINABLE HERE WE WERE ADVANCING OVER ABSOLUTELY VIRGIN GROUND AND ABLE TO SEE NOTHING
2843-152918-0047 THE SURFACE REMAINED ABOUT THE SAME POSSIBLY RATHER MORE UNDULATING THAT IT HAD BEEN BLOWING HERE AT SOME TIME AND VIOLENTLY TOO WAS SHOWN BY THE UNDER SURFACE WHICH WAS COMPOSED OF SASTRUGI AS HARD AS IRON
2843-152918-0048 LUCKILY FOR US THE SNOWFALL OF THE LAST FEW DAYS HAD FILLED THESE UP SO AS TO PRESENT A LEVEL SURFACE IT WAS HEAVY GOING THOUGH BETTER THAN ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AS WE WERE ADVANCING STILL BLINDLY
2843-152918-0049 AND FRETTING AT THE PERSISTENTLY THICK WEATHER ONE OF US SUDDENLY CALLED OUT HULLO LOOK THERE A WILD DARK SUMMIT ROSE HIGH OUT OF THE MASS OF FOG TO THE EAST SOUTH EAST IT WAS NOT FAR AWAY
2843-152918-0050 ON THE CONTRARY IT SEEMED THREATENINGLY NEAR AND RIGHT OVER US WE STOPPED AND LOOKED AT THE IMPOSING SIGHT BUT NATURE DID NOT EXPOSE HER OBJECTS OF INTEREST FOR LONG THE FOG ROLLED OVER AGAIN THICK HEAVY AND DARK
2843-152918-0051 AND BLOTTED OUT THE VIEW WE KNEW NOW THAT WE HAD TO BE PREPARED FOR SURPRISES AFTER WE HAD GONE ABOUT TEN MILES THE FOG AGAIN LIFTED FOR A MOMENT AND WE SAW QUITE NEAR A MILE OR SO AWAY
2843-152918-0052 TWO LONG NARROW MOUNTAIN RIDGES TO THE WEST OF US RUNNING NORTH AND SOUTH AND COMPLETELY COVERED WITH SNOW THESE
2843-152918-0053 THEY WERE BETWEEN NINE THOUSAND AND TEN THOUSAND FEET HIGH AND WOULD PROBABLY SERVE AS EXCELLENT LANDMARKS ON THE RETURN JOURNEY THERE WAS NO CONNECTION TO BE TRACED BETWEEN THESE MOUNTAINS AND THOSE LYING TO THE EAST OF THEM
2843-152918-0054 THEY GAVE US THE IMPRESSION OF BEING ENTIRELY ISOLATED SUMMITS AS WE COULD NOT MAKE OUT ANY LOFTY RIDGE RUNNING EAST AND WEST
2843-152918-0055 WE CONTINUED OUR COURSE IN THE CONSTANT EXPECTATION OF FINDING SOME SURPRISE OR OTHER IN OUR LINE OF ROUTE THE AIR AHEAD OF US WAS AS BLACK AS PITCH AS THOUGH IT CONCEALED SOMETHING
2843-152918-0056 IT COULD NOT BE A STORM OR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALREADY UPON US BUT WE WENT ON AND ON AND NOTHING CAME OUR DAY'S MARCH WAS EIGHTEEN AND A HALF MILES I SEE THAT MY DIARY FOR NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH
2843-152918-0057 DOES NOT BEGIN VERY PROMISINGLY FOG FOG AND AGAIN FOG ALSO FINE FALLING SNOW WHICH MAKES THE GOING IMPOSSIBLE POOR BEASTS THEY HAVE TOILED HARD TO GET THE SLEDGES FORWARD TO DAY
2843-152918-0058 BUT THE DAY DID NOT TURN OUT SO BADLY AFTER ALL AS WE WORKED OUR WAY OUT OF THIS UNCERTAINTY AND FOUND OUT WHAT WAS BEHIND THE PITCH DARK CLOUDS DURING THE FORENOON THE SUN CAME THROUGH AND THRUST ASIDE THE FOG FOR A WHILE AND THERE
2843-152918-0059 TO THE SOUTH EAST NOT MANY MILES AWAY LAY AN IMMENSE MOUNTAIN MASS FROM THIS MASS RIGHT ACROSS OUR COURSE RAN A GREAT ANCIENT GLACIER THE SUN SHONE DOWN UPON IT AND SHOWED US A SURFACE FULL OF HUGE IRREGULARITIES
2843-152918-0060 ON THE SIDE NEAREST TO THE MOUNTAIN THESE DISTURBANCES WERE SUCH THAT A HASTY GLANCE WAS ENOUGH TO SHOW US THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ADVANCING THAT WAY BUT RIGHT IN OUR LINE OF ROUTE STRAIGHT ON TO THE GLACIER
2843-152918-0061 AND WAITED FOR DECENTLY CLEAR WEATHER SO THAT WE MIGHT SURVEY THE GROUND AT OUR EASE AND CHOOSE THE BEST WAY GOING FORWARD WITHOUT AN IDEA OF WHAT THE GROUND WAS LIKE WAS NOT VERY PLEASANT
2843-152918-0062 BUT HOW LONG SHOULD WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR CLEAR WEATHER THAT QUESTION WAS UNANSWERABLE POSSIBLY A WEEK OR EVEN A FORTNIGHT AND WE HAD NO TIME FOR THAT BETTER GO STRAIGHT ON THEN AND TAKE WHAT MIGHT COME
2843-152918-0063 WHAT WE COULD SEE OF THE GLACIER APPEARED TO BE PRETTY STEEP BUT IT WAS ONLY BETWEEN THE SOUTH AND SOUTH EAST UNDER THE NEW LAND THAT THE FOG NOW AND AGAIN LIFTED SUFFICIENTLY TO ENABLE US TO SEE ANYTHING
2843-152918-0064 WE COULD SEE THAT THE BIG CREVASSES LOST THEMSELVES IN IT AND THE QUESTION OF WHAT THE GLACIER LOOKED LIKE ON THE WEST
2843-152918-0065 IT WAS PLAIN ENOUGH THAT WE SHOULD HAVE STIFF WORK IT WAS THEREFORE IMPORTANT TO HAVE AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE ON THE SLEDGES WE SET TO WORK AT ONCE TO BUILD THE DEPOT THE SNOW HERE WAS EXCELLENT FOR THIS PURPOSE
2843-152918-0066 AS HARD AS GLASS IN A SHORT TIME AN IMMENSE ERECTION OF ADAMANTINE BLOCKS OF SNOW ROSE INTO THE AIR CONTAINING PROVISIONS FOR FIVE MEN FOR SIX DAYS AND FOR EIGHTEEN DOGS FOR FIVE DAYS
2843-152918-0067 A NUMBER OF SMALL ARTICLES WERE ALSO LEFT BEHIND WHILE WE WERE THUS OCCUPIED THE FOG HAD BEEN COMING AND GOING SOME OF THE INTERVALS HAD BEEN QUITE CLEAR AND HAD GIVEN ME A GOOD VIEW OF THE NEAREST PART OF THE RANGE
2843-152918-0068 IT APPEARED TO BE QUITE ISOLATED AND TO CONSIST OF FOUR MOUNTAINS ONE OF THESE MOUNT HELMER HANSSEN LAY SEPARATED FROM THE REST THE OTHER THREE MOUNTS OSCAR WISTING
2843-152918-0069 AND OLAV BJAALAND LAY CLOSER TOGETHER BEHIND THIS GROUP THE AIR HAD BEEN HEAVY AND BLACK THE WHOLE TIME SHOWING THAT MORE LAND MUST BE CONCEALED THERE SUDDENLY
2843-152918-0070 AND THE SUMMITS OF A COLOSSAL MOUNTAIN MASS APPEARED OUR FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT THIS MOUNTAIN MOUNT THORVALD NILSEN MUST BE SOMETHING OVER TWENTY THOUSAND FEET HIGH IT POSITIVELY TOOK OUR BREATH AWAY
2843-152918-0071 SO FORMIDABLE DID IT APPEAR BUT IT WAS ONLY A GLIMPSE THAT WE HAD AND THEN THE FOG ENCLOSED IT ONCE MORE WE HAD SUCCEEDED IN TAKING A FEW MEAGRE BEARINGS OF THE DIFFERENT SUMMITS OF THE NEAREST GROUP
2843-152918-0072 THEY WERE NOT VERY GRAND BUT BETTER ONES WERE NOT TO BE OBTAINED FOR THAT MATTER THE SITE OF THE DEPOT WAS SO WELL MARKED BY ITS POSITION UNDER THE FOOT OF THE GLACIER THAT WE AGREED IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MISS IT
2843-152918-0073 HAVING FINISHED THE EDIFICE WHICH ROSE AT LEAST SIX FEET INTO THE AIR
2843-152918-0074 SO AS TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT STILL MORE EASILY ON THE WAY BACK AN OBSERVATION WE HAD CONTRIVED TO TAKE WHILE THE WORK WAS IN PROGRESS
2843-152918-0075 THIS DID NOT AGREE VERY WELL WITH THE LATITUDE OF OUR DEAD RECKONING
2843-152918-0076 AND A FINE LIGHT SNOW WAS FALLING WE HAD TAKEN A BEARING OF THE LINE OF GLACIER THAT WAS MOST FREE OF CREVASSES AND SO WE MOVED ON AGAIN
2843-152918-0077 THE CREVASSES AT ITS FOOT WERE NOT LARGE BUT WE HAD NO SOONER ENTERED UPON THE ASCENT THAN THE FUN BEGAN THERE WAS SOMETHING UNCANNY ABOUT THIS PERFECTLY BLIND ADVANCE AMONG CREVASSES AND CHASMS ON ALL SIDES
2843-152918-0078 WE EXAMINED THE COMPASS FROM TIME TO TIME AND WENT FORWARD CAUTIOUSLY
2843-152918-0079 BUT THAT AFTER ALL WAS NOT MUCH OF A HELP TO OUR DRIVERS
2843-152918-0080 AS THE CREVASSES WERE OFTEN RENDERED QUITE INVISIBLE BY A THIN OVERLYING LAYER OF SNOW
2843-152918-0081 TO HAVE TO CROSS SUCH A SURFACE AS THE EFFECT OF LIGHT AND SHADE IS USUALLY TO SHOW UP THE EDGES OF THESE INSIDIOUS PITFALLS BUT ON A DAY LIKE THIS WHEN EVERYTHING LOOKED ALIKE ONE'S ADVANCE IS DOUBTFUL WE KEPT IT GOING HOWEVER
2843-152918-0082 BY USING THE UTMOST CAUTION WISTING CAME NEAR TO SOUNDING THE DEPTH OF ONE OF THESE DANGEROUS CREVASSES WITH SLEDGE DOGS AND ALL AS THE BRIDGE HE WAS ABOUT TO CROSS GAVE WAY THANKS TO HIS PRESENCE OF MIND
2843-152918-0083 AND A LIGHTNING LIKE MOVEMENT SOME WOULD CALL IT LUCK HE MANAGED TO SAVE HIMSELF IN THIS WAY WE WORKED UP ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FEET BUT THEN WE CAME UPON SUCH A LABYRINTH OF YAWNING CHASMS AND OPEN ABYSSES
2843-152918-0084 THAT WE COULD NOT MOVE THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT TO FIND THE LEAST DISTURBED SPOT AND SET THE TENT THERE AS SOON AS THIS WAS DONE HANSSEN AND I SET OUT TO EXPLORE WE WERE ROPED AND THEREFORE SAFE ENOUGH
2843-152918-0085 IT REQUIRED SOME STUDY TO FIND A WAY OUT OF THE TRAP WE HAD RUN OURSELVES INTO TOWARDS THE GROUP OF MOUNTAINS LAST DESCRIBED WHICH NOW LAY TO THE EAST OF US
2843-152918-0086 IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND EVOKED A PICTURE OF VIOLENT CONFUSION THANK GOD WE WERE NOT HERE WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON I THOUGHT TO MYSELF AS I STOOD LOOKING OUT OVER THIS BATTLEFIELD IT MUST HAVE BEEN A SPECTACLE LIKE DOOMSDAY
2843-152918-0087 AND NOT ON A SMALL SCALE EITHER TO ADVANCE IN THAT DIRECTION THEN WAS HOPELESS BUT THAT WAS NO GREAT MATTER SINCE OUR WAY WAS TO THE SOUTH ON THE SOUTH WE COULD SEE NOTHING THE FOG LAY THICK AND HEAVY THERE
2843-152918-0088 THIS RIDGE LED US ON TO AN ICEWAVE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE FEET HIGH A FORMATION WHICH WAS DUE TO THE PRESSURE HAVING CEASED BEFORE THE WAVE HAD BEEN FORCED TO BREAK AND FORM HUMMOCKS
2843-152918-0089 WE SAW WELL ENOUGH THAT THIS WOULD BE A DIFFICULT PLACE TO PASS WITH SLEDGES AND DOGS BUT IN DEFAULT OF ANYTHING BETTER IT WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE FROM THE TOP OF THIS WAVE FORMATION WE COULD SEE DOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE
2843-152918-0090 WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN HIDDEN FROM US THE FOG PREVENTED OUR SEEING FAR BUT THE IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS WERE ENOUGH TO CONVINCE US THAT WITH CAUTION WE COULD BEAT UP FARTHER FROM THE HEIGHT ON WHICH WE STOOD
2843-152918-0091 AS WE SAW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OUR OBJECT WAS TO MAKE TRACKS FOR THE FOLLOWING DAY'S JOURNEY THE LANGUAGE WE USED ABOUT THE GLACIER AS WE WENT WAS NOT ALTOGETHER COMPLIMENTARY WE HAD ENDLESS TACKING AND TURNING TO GET ON
2843-152918-0092 A FISSURE HAD OPENED MAKING A GATEWAY ABOUT SIX FEET WIDE THIS FORMATION LIKE EVERY THING ELSE ON THE GLACIER WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY OLD AND FOR THE MOST PART FILLED WITH SNOW
2843-152918-0093 FROM THIS POINT THE GLACIER AS FAR AS OUR VIEW EXTENDED TO THE SOUTH LOOKED BETTER AND BETTER
2843-152918-0094 OUR COMPANIONS WERE NO LESS PLEASED WITH THE NEWS WE BROUGHT OF OUR PROSPECTS OUR ALTITUDE THAT EVENING WAS EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY FEET ABOVE THE SEA THAT IS TO SAY AT THE FOOT OF THE GLACIER
2843-152918-0095 WE HAD REACHED AN ALTITUDE OF EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FEET OR A DROP FROM THE BUTCHER'S OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FEET WE NOW KNEW VERY WELL THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THIS ASCENT TO MAKE AGAIN PERHAPS EVEN MORE
2843-152918-0096 AND THIS IDEA DID NOT AROUSE ANY PARTICULAR ENTHUSIASM IN MY DIARY I SEE THAT I CONCLUDE THE DAY WITH THE FOLLOWING WORDS WHAT WILL THE NEXT SURPRISE BE I WONDER IT WAS IN FACT
2843-152918-0097 AN EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY THAT WE WERE UNDERTAKING THROUGH NEW REGIONS NEW MOUNTAINS GLACIERS AND SO ON WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SEE
2843-152918-0098 WHAT I LIKED LEAST ABOUT THIS FEELING ONE'S WAY FORWARD IN THE DARK WAS THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT VERY DIFFICULT INDEED TO RECOGNIZE THE GROUND AGAIN ON THE WAY BACK BUT WITH THIS GLACIER LYING STRAIGHT ACROSS OUR LINE OF ROUTE
2843-152918-0099 A MISTAKE THERE MIGHT BE SERIOUS ENOUGH AND IT WILL APPEAR LATER IN THIS NARRATIVE THAT MY FEAR OF OUR NOT BEING ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THE WAY WAS NOT ENTIRELY GROUNDLESS THE BEACONS WE HAD PUT UP CAME TO OUR AID
2843-152918-0100 AND FOR OUR FINAL SUCCESS WE OWE A DEEP DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO OUR PRUDENCE AND THOUGHTFULNESS IN ADOPTING THIS EXPEDIENT NEXT MORNING NOVEMBER TWENTY NINTH BROUGHT CONSIDERABLY CLEARER WEATHER
2843-152918-0101 AND ALLOWED US A VERY GOOD SURVEY OF OUR POSITION WE COULD NOW SEE THAT THE TWO MOUNTAIN RANGES
2843-152918-0102 WITH SUMMITS FROM TEN THOUSAND TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND FEET MOUNT THORVALD NILSEN WAS THE MOST SOUTHERLY WE COULD SEE FROM THIS POINT MOUNTS HANSSEN WISTING BJAALAND AND HASSEL FORMED AS WE HAD THOUGHT THE DAY BEFORE
2843-152918-0103 A GROUP BY THEMSELVES AND LAY SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN RANGE THE DRIVERS HAD A WARM MORNING'S WORK THEY HAD TO DRIVE WITH GREAT CIRCUMSPECTION AND PATIENCE TO GRAPPLE WITH THE KIND OF GROUND WE HAD BEFORE US
2843-152918-0104 A SLIGHT MISTAKE MIGHT BE ENOUGH TO SEND BOTH SLEDGE AND DOGS WITH LIGHTNING RAPIDITY INTO THE NEXT WORLD IT TOOK NEVERTHELESS A REMARKABLY SHORT TIME TO COVER THE DISTANCE WE HAD EXPLORED ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING BEFORE WE KNEW IT
2843-152918-0105 WE WERE AT HELL'S GATE BJAALAND TOOK AN EXCELLENT PHOTOGRAPH HERE WHICH GIVES A VERY GOOD IDEA OF THE DIFFICULTIES THIS PART OF THE JOURNEY PRESENTED IN THE FOREGROUND
2843-152918-0106 BELOW THE HIGH SNOW RIDGE THAT FORMS ONE SIDE OF A VERY WIDE BUT PARTLY FILLED UP CREVASSE THE MARKS OF SKI CAN BE SEEN IN THE SNOW THIS WAS THE PHOTOGRAPHER WHO IN PASSING OVER THIS SNOW BRIDGE
2843-152918-0107 STRUCK HIS SKI INTO IT TO TRY THE STRENGTH OF THE SUPPORT CLOSE TO THE TRACKS CAN BE SEEN AN OPEN PIECE OF THE CREVASSE IT IS A PALE BLUE AT THE TOP BUT ENDS IN THE DEEPEST BLACK IN A BOTTOMLESS ABYSS
2843-152918-0108 THE PHOTOGRAPHER GOT OVER THE BRIDGE AND BACK WITH A WHOLE SKIN BUT THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION OF RISKING SLEDGES AND DOGS ON IT AND IT CAN BE SEEN IN THE PHOTOGRAPH THAT THE SLEDGES HAVE BEEN TURNED RIGHT ROUND TO TRY ANOTHER WAY
2843-152918-0109 BUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE TURNS AND CIRCUITS WE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO MAKE IT WAS NOT SO SHORT AFTER ALL WE SET OUR TENT ON A GOOD SOLID FOUNDATION AND WERE WELL PLEASED WITH THE DAY'S WORK
2843-152918-0110 THE ALTITUDE WAS EIGHT THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED SIXTY FEET ABOVE THE SEA THE SUN WAS NOW IN THE WEST AND SHINING DIRECTLY UPON THE HUGE MOUNTAIN MASSES IT WAS A FAIRY LANDSCAPE IN BLUE AND WHITE
2843-152918-0111 CLEAR AS IT NOW APPEARED TO BE ONE COULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE WEATHER WAS NOT ALL THAT COULD BE WISHED FOR THE SOUTH EASTERN END OF MOUNT THORVALD NILSEN LOST ITSELF IN A DARK IMPENETRABLE CLOUD
2843-152918-0112 WHICH LED ONE TO SUSPECT A CONTINUATION IN THAT DIRECTION THOUGH ONE COULD NOT BE CERTAIN MOUNT NILSEN AH ANYTHING MORE BEAUTIFUL TAKING IT ALTOGETHER I HAVE NEVER SEEN
2843-152918-0113 PEAKS OF THE MOST VARIED FORMS ROSE HIGH INTO THE AIR PARTLY COVERED WITH DRIVING CLOUDS SOME WERE SHARP BUT MOST WERE LONG AND ROUNDED HERE AND THERE ONE SAW BRIGHT SHINING GLACIERS
2843-152918-0114 PLUNGING WILDLY DOWN THE STEEP SIDES AND MERGING INTO THE UNDERLYING GROUND IN FEARFUL CONFUSION BUT THE MOST REMARKABLE OF THEM ALL WAS MOUNT HELMER HANSSEN ITS TOP WAS AS ROUND AS THE BOTTOM OF A BOWL
2843-152918-0115 AND COVERED BY AN EXTRAORDINARY ICE SHEET WHICH WAS SO BROKEN UP AND DISTURBED THAT THE BLOCKS OF ICE BRISTLED IN EVERY DIRECTION LIKE THE QUILLS OF A PORCUPINE IT GLITTERED AND BURNED IN THE SUNLIGHT A GLORIOUS SPECTACLE
289-121652-0000 NONE OF US WHETHER CHILDREN OR ADULTS NEEDS AN INTRODUCTION TO MOTHER GOOSE THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE EARLIEST IMPRESSED UPON OUR MINDS CLING TO THEM MOST TENACIOUSLY THE SNATCHES SUNG IN THE NURSERY ARE NEVER FORGOTTEN
289-121652-0001 NOR ARE THEY EVER RECALLED WITHOUT BRINGING BACK WITH THEM MYRIADS OF SLUMBERING FEELINGS AND HALF FORGOTTEN IMAGES WE HEAR THE SWEET LOW VOICE OF THE MOTHER SINGING SOFT LULLABIES TO HER DARLING
289-121652-0002 AND SEE THE KINDLY WRINKLED FACE OF THE GRANDMOTHER AS SHE CROONS THE OLD DITTIES TO QUIET OUR RESTLESS SPIRITS ONE GENERATION IS LINKED TO ANOTHER BY THE EVERLASTING SPIRIT OF SONG
289-121652-0003 THE BALLADS OF THE NURSERY FOLLOW US FROM CHILDHOOD TO OLD AGE AND THEY ARE READILY BROUGHT FROM MEMORY'S RECESSES AT ANY TIME TO AMUSE OUR CHILDREN OR OUR GRANDCHILDREN THE COLLECTION OF JINGLES WE KNOW AND LOVE AS THE MELODIES OF MOTHER GOOSE
289-121652-0004 ARE EVIDENTLY DRAWN FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES WHILE THEY ARE TAKEN ALTOGETHER A HAPPY UNION OF RHYME WIT
289-121652-0005 THE RESEARCH AFTER THE AUTHOR OF EACH INDIVIDUAL VERSE WOULD INDEED BE HOPELESS IT WOULD BE FOLLY TO SUPPOSE THEM ALL THE COMPOSITION OF UNEDUCATED OLD NURSES FOR MANY OF THEM CONTAIN MUCH REFLECTION WIT AND MELODY
289-121652-0006 IT IS SAID THAT SHELLEY WROTE PUSSY CAT MEW AND DEAN SWIFT LITTLE BO PEEP AND THESE ASSERTIONS ARE AS DIFFICULT TO DISPROVE AS TO PROVE SOME OF THE OLDER VERSES HOWEVER
289-121652-0007 ARE DOUBTLESS OFFSHOOTS FROM ANCIENT FOLK LORE SONGS AND HAVE DESCENDED TO US THROUGH MANY CENTURIES THE CONNECTION OF MOTHER GOOSE WITH THE RHYMES WHICH BEAR HER NAME IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE AND IN FACT THREE COUNTRIES CLAIM HER FOR THEIR OWN
289-121652-0008 FRANCE ENGLAND AND AMERICA ABOUT THE YEAR SIXTEEN FIFTY THERE APPEARED IN CIRCULATION IN LONDON A SMALL BOOK NAMED RHYMES OF THE NURSERY OR LULLA BYES FOR CHILDREN
289-121652-0009 WHICH CONTAINED MANY OF THE IDENTICAL PIECES THAT HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN TO US BUT THE NAME OF MOTHER GOOSE WAS EVIDENTLY NOT THEN KNOWN IN THIS EDITION WERE THE RHYMES OF LITTLE JACK HOMER OLD KING COLE MISTRESS MARY SING A SONG O SIXPENCE
289-121652-0010 AND LITTLE BOY BLUE IN SIXTEEN NINETY SEVEN CHARLES PERRAULT PUBLISHED IN FRANCE
289-121652-0011 ALTHOUGH PERRAULT'S TALES DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE WE NOW KNOW UNDER THIS TITLE THEY COMPRISED THE SLEEPING BEAUTY THE FAIRY LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD BLUE BEARD PUSS IN BOOTS
289-121652-0012 RIQUET WITH THE TUFT CINDERELLA AND LITTLE THUMB EIGHT STORIES IN ALL ON THE COVER OF THE BOOK WAS DEPICTED AN OLD LADY HOLDING IN HER HAND A DISTAFF
289-121652-0013 AMERICA BASES HER CLAIM TO MOTHER GOOSE UPON THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT MADE BY THE LATE JOHN FLEET ELIOT A DESCENDANT OF THOMAS FLEET THE PRINTER AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THERE LIVED IN BOSTON A LADY NAMED ELIZA GOOSE
289-121652-0014 WRITTEN ALSO VERGOOSE AND VERTIGOOSE WHO BELONGED TO A WEALTHY FAMILY HER ELDEST DAUGHTER ELIZABETH GOOSE OR VERTIGOOSE
289-121652-0015 AND IN DUE TIME GAVE BIRTH TO A SON LIKE MOST MOTHERS IN LAW IN OUR DAY THE IMPORTANCE OF MISSUS GOOSE INCREASED WITH THE APPEARANCE OF HER GRANDCHILD AND POOR MISTER FLEET HALF DISTRACTED WITH HER ENDLESS NURSERY DITTIES FINDING ALL OTHER MEANS FAIL
289-121652-0016 TRIED WHAT RIDICULE COULD EFFECT AND ACTUALLY PRINTED A BOOK UNDER THE TITLE SONGS OF THE NURSERY OR MOTHER GOOSE'S MELODIES FOR CHILDREN ON THE TITLE PAGE WAS THE PICTURE OF A GOOSE WITH A VERY LONG NECK AND A MOUTH WIDE OPEN AND BELOW THIS
289-121652-0017 PRINTED BY T FLEET AT HIS PRINTING HOUSE IN PUDDING LANE SEVENTEEN NINETEEN PRICE TWO COPPERS MISTER WM A WHEELER THE EDITOR OF HURD AND HOUGHTON'S ELABORATE EDITION OF MOTHER GOOSE EIGHTEEN SEVENTY REITERATED THIS ASSERTION
289-121652-0018 AND A WRITER IN THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT OF JUNE SEVENTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR SAYS FLEET'S BOOK WAS PARTLY A REPRINT OF AN ENGLISH COLLECTION OF SONGS BARCLAY'S AND THE NEW TITLE WAS DOUBTLESS A COMPLIMENT BY THE PRINTER TO HIS MOTHER IN LAW GOOSE FOR HER CONTRIBUTIONS
289-121652-0019 SHE WAS THE MOTHER OF SIXTEEN CHILDREN AND A TYPICAL OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE WE MAY TAKE IT TO BE TRUE THAT FLEET'S WIFE WAS OF THE VERGOOSE FAMILY AND THAT THE NAME WAS OFTEN CONTRACTED TO GOOSE
289-121652-0020 BUT THE REST OF THE STORY IS UNSUPPORTED BY ANY EVIDENCE WHATEVER IN FACT ALL THAT MISTER ELIOT KNEW OF IT WAS THE STATEMENT OF THE LATE EDWARD A CROWNINSHIELD OF BOSTON THAT HE HAD SEEN FLEET'S EDITION IN THE LIBRARY OF THE AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY
289-121652-0021 REPEATED RESEARCHES AT WORCESTER HAVING FAILED TO BRING TO LIGHT THIS SUPPOSED COPY AND NO RECORD OF IT APPEARING ON ANY CATALOGUE THERE WE MAY DISMISS THE ENTIRE STORY WITH THE SUPPOSITION THAT MISTER ELIOT MISUNDERSTOOD THE REMARKS MADE TO HIM
289-121652-0022 INDEED AS MISTER WILLIAM H WHITMORE POINTS OUT IN HIS CLEVER MONOGRAPH UPON MOTHER GOOSE ALBANY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE IT IS VERY DOUBTFUL WHETHER IN SEVENTEEN NINETEEN
289-121652-0023 BOSTON CHILDREN AT THAT DATE SAYS MISTER WHITMORE WERE FED UPON GOSPEL FOOD AND IT SEEMS EXTREMELY IMPROBABLE THAT AN EDITION COULD HAVE BEEN SOLD
289-121652-0024 IS OF ABOUT THE SAME DATE AS BOSTON'S THERE LIVED IN A TOWN IN SUSSEX ABOUT THE YEAR SEVENTEEN O FOUR AN OLD WOMAN NAMED MARTHA GOOCH SHE WAS A CAPITAL NURSE AND IN GREAT DEMAND TO CARE FOR NEWLY BORN BABIES THEREFORE
289-121652-0025 THROUGH LONG YEARS OF SERVICE AS NURSE SHE CAME TO BE CALLED MOTHER GOOCH THIS GOOD WOMAN HAD ONE PECULIARITY SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO CROON QUEER RHYMES AND JINGLES OVER THE CRADLES OF HER CHARGES AND THESE RHYMES
289-121652-0026 SEEMED SO SENSELESS AND SILLY TO THE PEOPLE WHO OVERHEARD THEM THAT THEY BEGAN TO CALL HER MOTHER GOOSE IN DERISION THE TERM BEING DERIVED FROM QUEEN GOOSEFOOT THE MOTHER OF CHARLEMAGNE THE OLD NURSE PAID NO ATTENTION TO HER CRITICS
289-121652-0027 BUT CONTINUED TO SING HER RHYMES AS BEFORE FOR HOWEVER MUCH GROWN PEOPLE MIGHT LAUGH AT HER THE CHILDREN SEEMED TO ENJOY THEM VERY MUCH AND NOT ONE OF THEM WAS TOO PEEVISH TO BE QUIETED AND SOOTHED BY HER VERSES
289-121652-0028 AT ONE TIME MISTRESS GOOCH WAS NURSING A CHILD OF MISTER RONALD BARCLAY A PHYSICIAN RESIDING IN THE TOWN AND HE NOTICED THE RHYMES SHE SANG AND BECAME INTERESTED IN THEM IN TIME HE WROTE THEM ALL DOWN AND MADE A BOOK OF THEM
289-121652-0029 WHICH IT IS SAID WAS PRINTED BY JOHN WORTHINGTON AND SON IN THE STRAND LONDON IN SEVENTEEN TWELVE UNDER THE NAME OF YE MELODIOUS RHYMES OF MOTHER GOOSE BUT EVEN THIS STORY OF MARTHA GOOCH
289-121652-0030 IS BASED UPON VERY MEAGER AND UNSATISFACTORY EVIDENCE THE EARLIEST ENGLISH EDITION OF MOTHER GOOSE'S MELODIES THAT IS ABSOLUTELY AUTHENTIC WAS ISSUED BY JOHN NEWBURY OF LONDON ABOUT THE YEAR SEVENTEEN SIXTY AND THE FIRST AUTHENTIC AMERICAN EDITION
289-121652-0031 IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE NONE OF THE EARLIER EDITIONS HOWEVER CONTAINED ALL THE RHYMES SO WELL KNOWN AT THE PRESENT DAY SINCE EVERY DECADE HAS ADDED ITS QUOTA TO THE MASS OF JINGLES ATTRIBUTED TO MOTHER GOOSE
289-121652-0032 SOME OF THE EARLIER VERSES HAVE BECOME ENTIRELY OBSOLETE AND IT IS WELL THEY HAVE FOR MANY WERE CRUDE AND SILLY AND OTHERS WERE COARSE IT IS SIMPLY A RESULT OF THE GREATER REFINEMENT OF MODERN CIVILIZATION
289-121652-0033 THAT THEY HAVE BEEN RELEGATED TO OBLIVION WHILE THE REAL GEMS OF THE COLLECTION WILL DOUBTLESS LIVE AND GROW IN POPULAR FAVOR FOR MANY AGES
289-121652-0034 IT DOES NOT MATTER IN THE LEAST WHETHER SHE WAS IN REALITY A MYTH OR A LIVING ELIZA GOOSE MARTHA GOOCH OR THE MERE OYE OF PERRAULT THE SONGS THAT CLUSTER AROUND HER NAME ARE WHAT WE LOVE
289-121652-0035 AND EACH INDIVIDUAL VERSE APPEALS MORE TO THE CHILDISH MIND THAN DOES MOTHER GOOSE HERSELF MANY OF THESE NURSERY RHYMES ARE COMPLETE TALES IN THEMSELVES TELLING THEIR STORY TERSELY BUT COMPLETELY THERE ARE OTHERS WHICH ARE BUT BARE SUGGESTIONS
289-121652-0036 LEAVING THE IMAGINATION TO WEAVE IN THE DETAILS OF THE STORY PERHAPS THEREIN MAY LIE PART OF THEIR CHARM BUT HOWEVER THAT MAY BE I HAVE THOUGHT THE CHILDREN MIGHT LIKE THE STORIES TOLD AT GREATER LENGTH THAT THEY MAY DWELL THE LONGER UPON THEIR FAVORITE HEROES AND HEROINES
289-121652-0037 FOR THAT REASON I HAVE WRITTEN THIS BOOK IN MAKING THE STORIES I HAVE FOLLOWED MAINLY THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE RHYMES AND MY HOPE IS THAT THE LITTLE ONES WILL LIKE THEM AND NOT FIND THAT THEY INTERFERE WITH THE FANCIFUL CREATIONS OF THEIR OWN IMAGINATIONS
289-121652-0038 L FRANK BAUM CHICAGO ILLINOIS
289-121665-0000 AND ONE OF THESE FLOCKS USED TO BE CARED FOR BY A POOR WOMAN WHO SUPPORTED HERSELF AND HER LITTLE GIRL BY THIS MEANS THEY LIVED IN A SMALL COTTAGE NESTLED AT THE FOOT OF ONE OF THE HILLS AND EACH MORNING THE MOTHER TOOK HER CROOK
289-121665-0001 AND STARTED OUT WITH HER SHEEP THAT THEY MIGHT FEED UPON THE TENDER JUICY GRASSES WITH WHICH THE HILLS ABOUNDED THE LITTLE GIRL USUALLY ACCOMPANIED HER MOTHER AND SAT BY HER SIDE
289-121665-0002 UPON THE GRASSY MOUNDS AND WATCHED HER CARE FOR THE EWES AND LAMBS SO THAT IN TIME SHE HERSELF GREW TO BE A VERY PROFICIENT SHEPHERDESS SO WHEN THE MOTHER BECAME TOO OLD AND FEEBLE TO LEAVE HER COTTAGE LITTLE BO PEEP AS SHE WAS CALLED

289-121665-0021 VERY SOON I SHALL SEE THE SHEEP COMING BACK BUT TIME PASSED AWAY AND STILL THE ERRANT FLOCK FAILED TO MAKE ITS APPEARANCE SOON THE HEAD OF THE LITTLE SHEPHERDESS BEGAN TO NOD
289-121665-0022 LITTLE BO PEEP FELL FAST ASLEEP AND DREAMT SHE HEARD THEM BLEATING BUT WHEN SHE AWOKE SHE FOUND IT A JOKE FOR STILL THEY WERE A FLEETING THE GIRL NOW BECAME QUITE ANXIOUS AND WONDERED WHY THE OLD WOMAN HAD NOT DRIVEN HER FLOCK OVER THE HILL
289-121665-0023 BUT AS IT WAS NOW TIME FOR LUNCHEON SHE OPENED HER LITTLE BASKET AND ATE OF THE BREAD AND CHEESE AND COOKIES SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER AFTER SHE HAD FINISHED HER MEAL AND TAKEN A DRINK OF COOL WATER FROM A SPRING NEAR BY
289-121665-0024 SHE DECIDED SHE WOULD NOT WAIT ANY LONGER SO UP SHE TOOK HER LITTLE CROOK DETERMINED FOR TO FIND THEM AND BEGAN CLIMBING THE HILL WHEN SHE GOT TO THE TOP THERE WAS NEVER A SIGHT OF SHEEP ABOUT
289-121665-0025 ONLY A GREEN VALLEY AND ANOTHER HILL BEYOND NOW REALLY ALARMED FOR THE SAFETY OF HER CHARGE BO PEEP HURRIED INTO THE VALLEY AND UP THE FARTHER HILL SIDE PANTING AND TIRED SHE REACHED THE SUMMIT AND PAUSING BREATHLESSLY
289-121665-0026 GAZED BELOW HER QUIETLY FEEDING UPON THE RICH GRASS WAS HER TRUANT FLOCK LOOKING AS PEACEFUL AND INNOCENT AS IF IT HAD NEVER STRAYED AWAY FROM ITS GENTLE SHEPHERDESS BO PEEP UTTERED A CRY OF JOY AND HURRIED TOWARD THEM
289-121665-0027 BUT WHEN SHE CAME NEAR SHE STOPPED IN AMAZEMENT AND HELD UP HER LITTLE HANDS WITH A PRETTY EXPRESSION OF DISMAY SHE HAD FOUND THEM INDEED BUT IT MADE HER HEART BLEED
289-121665-0028 NOTHING WAS LEFT TO EACH SHEEP BUT A WEE LITTLE STUMP WHERE A TAIL SHOULD BE AND LITTLE BO PEEP WAS SO HEART BROKEN THAT SHE SAT DOWN BESIDE THEM AND SOBBED BITTERLY
289-121665-0029 BUT AFTER AWHILE THE TINY MAID REALIZED THAT ALL HER TEARS WOULD NOT BRING BACK THE TAILS TO HER LAMBKINS SO SHE PLUCKED UP COURAGE AND DRIED HER EYES AND AROSE FROM THE GROUND JUST AS THE OLD WOMAN HOBBLED UP TO HER
289-121665-0030 SO YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR SHEEP DEARIE SHE SAID IN HER CRACKED VOICE YES REPLIED LITTLE BO PEEP WITH DIFFICULTY REPRESSING A SOB BUT LOOK MOTHER THEY VE ALL LEFT THEIR TAILS BEHIND THEM WHY SO THEY HAVE EXCLAIMED THE OLD WOMAN
289-121665-0031 AND THEN SHE BEGAN TO LAUGH AS IF SOMETHING PLEASED HER WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE HAS BECOME OF THEIR TAILS ASKED THE GIRL OH SOME ONE HAS PROBABLY CUT THEM OFF THEY MAKE NICE TIPPETS IN WINTER TIME YOU KNOW
289-121665-0032 AND THEN SHE PATTED THE CHILD UPON HER HEAD AND WALKED AWAY DOWN THE VALLEY BO PEEP WAS MUCH GRIEVED OVER THE LOSS THAT HAD BEFALLEN HER DEAR SHEEP AND SO DRIVING THEM BEFORE HER SHE WANDERED AROUND TO SEE IF BY ANY CHANCE SHE COULD FIND THE LOST TAILS
289-121665-0033 BUT SOON THE SUN BEGAN TO SINK OVER THE HILL TOPS AND SHE KNEW SHE MUST TAKE HER SHEEP HOME BEFORE NIGHT OVERTOOK THEM SHE DID NOT TELL HER MOTHER OF HER MISFORTUNE FOR SHE FEARED THE OLD SHEPHERDESS WOULD SCOLD HER
289-121665-0034 AND BO PEEP HAD FULLY DECIDED TO SEEK FOR THE TAILS AND FIND THEM BEFORE SHE RELATED THE STORY OF THEIR LOSS TO ANYONE EACH DAY FOR MANY DAYS AFTER THAT LITTLE BO PEEP WANDERED ABOUT THE HILLS SEEKING THE TAILS OF HER SHEEP
289-121665-0035 AND THOSE WHO MET HER WONDERED WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO MAKE THE SWEET LITTLE MAID SO ANXIOUS BUT THERE IS AN END TO ALL TROUBLES NO MATTER HOW SEVERE THEY MAY SEEM TO BE AND IT HAPPENED ONE DAY AS BO PEEP DID STRAY UNTO A MEADOW HARD BY
289-121665-0036 THE LITTLE SHEPHERDESS WAS OVERJOYED AT THIS DISCOVERY AND REACHING UP HER CROOK SHE KNOCKED THE ROW OF PRETTY WHITE TAILS OFF THE TREE AND GATHERED THEM UP IN HER FROCK BUT HOW TO FASTEN THEM ONTO HER SHEEP AGAIN WAS THE QUESTION
289-121665-0037 AND AFTER PONDERING THE MATTER FOR A TIME SHE BECAME DISCOURAGED AND THINKING SHE WAS NO BETTER OFF THAN BEFORE THE TAILS WERE FOUND SHE BEGAN TO WEEP AND TO BEWAIL HER MISFORTUNE BUT AMIDST HER TEARS SHE BETHOUGHT HERSELF OF HER NEEDLE AND THREAD
289-121665-0038 WHY SHE EXCLAIMED SMILING AGAIN I CAN SEW THEM ON OF COURSE THEN SHE HEAVED A SIGH AND WIPED HER EYE AND RAN O'ER HILL AND DALE OH AND TRIED WHAT SHE COULD AS A SHEPHERDESS SHOULD TO TACK TO EACH SHEEP ITS TAIL OH
289-121665-0039 BUT THE VERY FIRST SHEEP SHE CAME TO REFUSED TO ALLOW HER TO SEW ON THE TAIL AND RAN AWAY FROM HER AND THE OTHERS DID THE SAME SO THAT FINALLY SHE WAS UTTERLY DISCOURAGED SHE WAS BEGINNING TO CRY AGAIN WHEN THE SAME OLD WOMAN SHE HAD BEFORE MET
289-121665-0040 CAME HOBBLING TO HER SIDE AND ASKED WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH MY CAT TAILS YOUR CAT TAILS REPLIED BO PEEP IN SURPRISE WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHY THESE TAILS ARE ALL CUT FROM WHITE PUSSYCATS AND I PUT THEM ON THE TREE TO DRY
289-121665-0041 WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THEM I THOUGHT THEY BELONGED TO MY SHEEP ANSWERED BO PEEP SORROWFULLY
289-121665-0042 I MUST HUNT UNTIL I FIND THOSE THAT BELONG TO MY SHEEP MY DEAR SAID THE OLD WOMAN I HAVE BEEN DECEIVING YOU YOU SAID YOU KNEW ALL ABOUT YOUR SHEEP AND I WANTED TO TEACH YOU A LESSON FOR HOWEVER WISE WE MAY BE
289-121665-0043 NO ONE IN THIS WORLD KNOWS ALL ABOUT ANYTHING SHEEP DO NOT HAVE LONG TAILS THERE IS ONLY A LITTLE STUMP TO ANSWER FOR A TAIL NEITHER DO RABBITS HAVE TAILS NOR BEARS NOR MANY OTHER ANIMALS
289-121665-0044 AND IF YOU HAD BEEN OBSERVING YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN ALL THIS WHEN I SAID THE SHEEP WOULD BE WAGGING THEIR TAILS BEHIND THEM AND THEN YOU WOULD NOT HAVE PASSED ALL THOSE DAYS IN SEARCHING FOR WHAT IS NOT TO BE FOUND
289-121665-0045 SO NOW LITTLE ONE RUN AWAY HOME AND TRY TO BE MORE THOUGHTFUL IN THE FUTURE YOUR SHEEP WILL NEVER MISS THE TAILS
289-121665-0046 AND NOW LITTLE BO PEEP NO MORE DID WEEP MY TALE OF TAILS ENDS HERE

2893-139322-0005 AND BLOTTED OUT THE PICTURE PRESENTLY THEY LEFT THE WAY AND DESCENDED BY A LIFT AND TRAVERSED A PASSAGE THAT SLOPED DOWNWARD AND SO CAME TO A DESCENDING LIFT AGAIN THE APPEARANCE OF THINGS CHANGED EVEN THE PRETENCE OF ARCHITECTURAL ORNAMENT DISAPPEARED
2893-139322-0006 THE LIGHTS DIMINISHED IN NUMBER AND SIZE THE ARCHITECTURE BECAME MORE AND MORE MASSIVE IN PROPORTION TO THE SPACES AS THE FACTORY QUARTERS WERE REACHED AND IN THE DUSTY BISCUIT MAKING PLACE OF THE POTTERS AMONG THE FELSPAR MILLS IN THE FURNACE ROOMS OF THE METAL WORKERS
2893-139322-0007 THE BLUE CANVAS CLOTHING WAS ON MAN WOMAN AND CHILD MANY OF THESE GREAT AND DUSTY GALLERIES WERE SILENT AVENUES OF MACHINERY ENDLESS RAKED OUT ASHEN FURNACES TESTIFIED TO THE REVOLUTIONARY DISLOCATION
2893-139322-0008 BUT WHEREVER THERE WAS WORK IT WAS BEING DONE BY SLOW MOVING WORKERS IN BLUE CANVAS THE ONLY PEOPLE NOT IN BLUE CANVAS WERE THE OVERLOOKERS OF THE WORK PLACES AND THE ORANGE CLAD LABOUR POLICE AND FRESH FROM THE FLUSHED FACES OF THE DANCING HALLS
2893-139322-0009 THE VOLUNTARY VIGOURS OF THE BUSINESS QUARTER GRAHAM COULD NOTE THE PINCHED FACES THE FEEBLE MUSCLES AND WEARY EYES OF MANY OF THE LATTER DAY WORKERS SUCH AS HE SAW AT WORK WERE NOTICEABLY INFERIOR IN PHYSIQUE TO THE FEW GAILY DRESSED MANAGERS AND FOREWOMEN
2893-139322-0010 WHO WERE DIRECTING THEIR LABOURS THE BURLY LABOURERS OF THE OLD VICTORIAN TIMES HAD FOLLOWED THAT DRAY HORSE AND ALL SUCH LIVING FORCE PRODUCERS TO EXTINCTION THE PLACE OF HIS COSTLY MUSCLES WAS TAKEN BY SOME DEXTEROUS MACHINE
2893-139322-0011 THE LATTER DAY LABOURER MALE AS WELL AS FEMALE WAS ESSENTIALLY A MACHINE MINDER AND FEEDER A SERVANT AND ATTENDANT OR AN ARTIST UNDER DIRECTION THE WOMEN IN COMPARISON WITH THOSE GRAHAM REMEMBERED
2893-139322-0012 WERE AS A CLASS DISTINCTLY PLAIN AND FLAT CHESTED TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF EMANCIPATION FROM THE MORAL RESTRAINTS OF PURITANICAL RELIGION TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF CITY LIFE HAD DONE THEIR WORK IN ELIMINATING THE STRAIN OF FEMININE BEAUTY AND VIGOUR FROM THE BLUE CANVAS MYRIADS
2893-139322-0013 TO BE BRILLIANT PHYSICALLY OR MENTALLY TO BE IN ANY WAY ATTRACTIVE OR EXCEPTIONAL HAD BEEN AND WAS STILL A CERTAIN WAY OF EMANCIPATION TO THE DRUDGE A LINE OF ESCAPE TO THE PLEASURE CITY AND ITS SPLENDOURS AND DELIGHTS AND AT LAST
2893-139322-0014 TO THE EUTHANASY AND PEACE TO BE STEADFAST AGAINST SUCH INDUCEMENTS WAS SCARCELY TO BE EXPECTED OF MEANLY NOURISHED SOULS IN THE YOUNG CITIES OF GRAHAM'S FORMER LIFE THE NEWLY AGGREGATED LABOURING MASS
2893-139322-0015 HAD BEEN A DIVERSE MULTITUDE STILL STIRRED BY THE TRADITION OF PERSONAL HONOUR AND A HIGH MORALITY NOW IT WAS DIFFERENTIATING INTO AN INSTINCT CLASS WITH A MORAL AND PHYSICAL DIFFERENCE OF ITS OWN EVEN WITH A DIALECT OF ITS OWN
2893-139322-0016 THEY PENETRATED DOWNWARD EVER DOWNWARD TOWARDS THE WORKING PLACES PRESENTLY THEY PASSED UNDERNEATH ONE OF THE STREETS OF THE MOVING WAYS AND SAW ITS PLATFORMS RUNNING ON THEIR RAILS FAR OVERHEAD AND CHINKS OF WHITE LIGHTS BETWEEN THE TRANSVERSE SLITS
2893-139322-0017 THE FACTORIES THAT WERE NOT WORKING WERE SPARSELY LIGHTED TO GRAHAM THEY AND THEIR SHROUDED AISLES OF GIANT MACHINES SEEMED PLUNGED IN GLOOM AND EVEN WHERE WORK WAS GOING ON THE ILLUMINATION WAS FAR LESS BRILLIANT THAN UPON THE PUBLIC WAYS
