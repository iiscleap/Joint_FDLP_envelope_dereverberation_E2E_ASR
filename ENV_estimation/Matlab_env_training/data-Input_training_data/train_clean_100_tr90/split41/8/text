2092-145709-0010 WHEN THEY HAD DONE THIS THEY APPROACHED THE BED ON WHICH THE TREMBLING GIRL LAY AND SCREAMING AND YELLING ALL THE TIME THEY DRAGGED HER TOWARDS THE CAULDRON SHE NEARLY DIED WITH FRIGHT
2092-145709-0011 BUT SHE NEVER UTTERED A SOUND THEN OF A SUDDEN THE COCK CREW AND ALL THE EVIL SPIRITS VANISHED AT THE SAME MOMENT THE CROW APPEARED AND HOPPED ALL ROUND THE ROOM WITH JOY
2092-145709-0012 IT THANKED THE PRINCESS MOST HEARTILY FOR HER GOODNESS AND SAID THAT ITS SUFFERINGS HAD ALREADY BEEN GREATLY LESSENED NOW ONE OF THE PRINCESS'S ELDER SISTERS WHO WAS VERY INQUISITIVE
2092-145709-0013 THAT AT LAST THE GOOD NATURED LITTLE PRINCESS CONSENTED BUT AT MIDNIGHT WHEN THE ODD FOLK APPEARED THE ELDER SISTER SCREAMED WITH TERROR AND FROM THIS TIME ON THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS
2092-145709-0014 INSISTED ALWAYS ON KEEPING WATCH ALONE SO SHE LIVED IN SOLITUDE ALL THE DAYTIME AND AT NIGHT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN FRIGHTENED HAD SHE NOT BEEN SO BRAVE BUT EVERY DAY
2092-145709-0015 THE CROW CAME AND THANKED HER FOR HER ENDURANCE AND ASSURED HER THAT HIS SUFFERINGS WERE FAR LESS THAN THEY HAD BEEN AND SO TWO YEARS PASSED AWAY WHEN ONE DAY THE CROW CAME TO THE PRINCESS AND SAID
2092-145709-0016 IN ANOTHER YEAR I SHALL BE FREED FROM THE SPELL I AM UNDER AT PRESENT BECAUSE THEN THE SEVEN YEARS WILL BE OVER BUT BEFORE I CAN RESUME MY NATURAL FORM
2092-145709-0017 AND TAKE POSSESSION OF THE BELONGINGS OF MY FOREFATHERS YOU MUST GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TAKE SERVICE AS A MAIDSERVANT THE YOUNG PRINCESS CONSENTED AT ONCE AND FOR A WHOLE YEAR
2092-145709-0018 AND HAD WORKED HER LITTLE WHITE HANDS WEARY SHE HEARD A RUSTLING BESIDE HER AND A CRY OF JOY THEN SHE SAW A HANDSOME YOUTH STANDING BESIDE HER WHO KNELT DOWN AT HER FEET
2092-145709-0019 AND KISSED THE LITTLE WEARY WHITE HANDS I AM THE PRINCE HE SAID WHO YOU IN YOUR GOODNESS WHEN I WAS WANDERING ABOUT IN THE SHAPE OF A BLACK CROW FREED FROM THE MOST AWFUL TORMENTS
2092-145709-0020 COME NOW TO MY CASTLE WITH ME AND LET US LIVE THERE HAPPILY TOGETHER SO THEY WENT TO THE CASTLE WHERE THEY HAD BOTH ENDURED SO MUCH
2092-145709-0021 IT WAS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS THE SAME FOR IT HAD ALL BEEN REBUILT AND DONE UP AGAIN
211-122425-0000 DO YOU KNOW THAT HIS EMINENCE HAS BEEN MAKING FRESH COMPLAINTS AGAINST YOUR MUSKETEERS
211-122425-0001 AH THESE MUSKETEERS OF YOURS ARE VERY DEVILS FELLOWS TO BE HANGED NO SIRE REPLIED TREVILLE WHO SAW AT THE FIRST GLANCE HOW THINGS WOULD GO ON THE CONTRARY THEY ARE GOOD CREATURES AS MEEK AS LAMBS AND HAVE BUT ONE DESIRE
211-122425-0002 I'LL BE THEIR WARRANTY AND THAT IS THAT THEIR SWORDS MAY NEVER LEAVE THEIR SCABBARDS BUT IN YOUR MAJESTY'S SERVICE BUT WHAT ARE THEY TO DO
211-122425-0003 WOULD NOT ONE SAY HE WAS SPEAKING OF A RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY IN TRUTH MY DEAR CAPTAIN
211-122425-0004 AND BY AND BY BY AND BY WE WILL SEE AH SIRE IT IS BECAUSE I CONFIDE IN THAT JUSTICE THAT I SHALL WAIT PATIENTLY AND QUIETLY THE GOOD PLEASURE OF YOUR MAJESTY
211-122425-0005 THE KING THEREFORE AROSE A MINUTE AFTER AND PUTTING THE MONEY WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM INTO HIS POCKET
211-122425-0006 LA VIEUVILLE SAID HE TAKE MY PLACE
211-122425-0007 AH I HAD EIGHTY LOUIS BEFORE ME PUT DOWN THE SAME SUM SO THAT THEY WHO HAVE LOST MAY HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF JUSTICE BEFORE EVERYTHING
211-122425-0008 YES SIRE AS THEY ALWAYS DO AND HOW DID THE THING HAPPEN LET US SEE FOR YOU KNOW MY DEAR CAPTAIN A JUDGE MUST HEAR BOTH SIDES GOOD LORD IN THE MOST SIMPLE AND NATURAL MANNER POSSIBLE
211-122425-0009 AND WHO HAVE I DARE AFFIRM TO THE KING HIS SERVICE MUCH AT HEART THREE OF MY BEST SOLDIERS I SAY
211-122425-0010 HAD MADE A PARTY OF PLEASURE WITH A YOUNG FELLOW FROM GASCONY WHOM I HAD INTRODUCED TO THEM THE SAME MORNING THE PARTY WAS TO TAKE PLACE AT SAINT GERMAIN I BELIEVE AND THEY HAD APPOINTED TO MEET AT THE CARMES DESCHAUX WHEN THEY WERE DISTURBED BY DE JUSSAC CAHUSAC
211-122425-0011 WHO CERTAINLY DID NOT GO THERE IN SUCH A NUMEROUS COMPANY WITHOUT SOME ILL INTENTION AGAINST THE EDICTS AH AH YOU INCLINE ME TO THINK SO SAID THE KING THERE IS NO DOUBT THEY WENT THITHER TO FIGHT THEMSELVES I DO NOT ACCUSE THEM SIRE
211-122425-0012 BUT I LEAVE YOUR MAJESTY TO JUDGE WHAT FIVE ARMED MEN COULD POSSIBLY BE GOING TO DO IN SUCH A DESERTED PLACE AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD
211-122425-0013 THEN UPON SEEING MY MUSKETEERS THEY CHANGED THEIR MINDS AND FORGOT THEIR PRIVATE HATRED FOR PARTISAN HATRED FOR YOUR MAJESTY CANNOT BE IGNORANT THAT THE MUSKETEERS WHO BELONG TO THE KING AND NOBODY BUT THE KING
211-122425-0014 ARE THE NATURAL ENEMIES OF THE GUARDSMEN WHO BELONG TO THE CARDINAL YES TREVILLE YES SAID THE KING IN A MELANCHOLY TONE AND IT IS VERY SAD BELIEVE ME TO SEE THUS TWO PARTIES IN FRANCE TWO HEADS TO ROYALTY
211-122425-0015 BUT I WILL NOT SWEAR TO IT SIRE YOU KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH AND UNLESS A MAN BE ENDOWED WITH THAT ADMIRABLE INSTINCT
211-122425-0016 YOU ARE RIGHT TREVILLE BUT THEY WERE NOT ALONE YOUR MUSKETEERS THEY HAD A YOUTH WITH THEM YES SIRE AND ONE WOUNDED MAN SO THAT THREE OF THE KING'S MUSKETEERS ONE OF WHOM WAS WOUNDED
211-122425-0017 AND A YOUTH NOT ONLY MAINTAINED THEIR GROUND AGAINST FIVE OF THE MOST TERRIBLE OF THE CARDINAL'S GUARDSMEN BUT ABSOLUTELY BROUGHT FOUR OF THEM TO EARTH WHY THIS IS A VICTORY CRIED THE KING ALL RADIANT A COMPLETE VICTORY
211-122425-0018 ONE HARDLY A YOUNG MAN BUT WHO HOWEVER BEHAVED HIMSELF SO ADMIRABLY ON THIS OCCASION THAT I WILL TAKE THE LIBERTY OF RECOMMENDING HIM TO YOUR MAJESTY HOW DOES HE CALL HIMSELF D'ARTAGNAN SIRE
211-122425-0019 HE IS THE SON OF ONE OF MY OLDEST FRIENDS THE SON OF A MAN WHO SERVED UNDER THE KING YOUR FATHER OF GLORIOUS MEMORY IN THE CIVIL WAR AND YOU SAY THIS YOUNG MAN BEHAVED HIMSELF WELL TELL ME HOW TREVILLE YOU KNOW HOW I DELIGHT IN ACCOUNTS OF WAR AND FIGHTING
211-122425-0020 PLACING HIS HAND UPON HIS HIP SIRE RESUMED TREVILLE AS I TOLD YOU
211-122425-0021 HE WAS DRESSED AS A CITIZEN THE GUARDS OF THE CARDINAL PERCEIVING HIS YOUTH AND THAT HE DID NOT BELONG TO THE CORPS INVITED HIM TO RETIRE BEFORE THEY ATTACKED SO YOU MAY PLAINLY SEE TREVILLE INTERRUPTED THE KING IT WAS THEY WHO ATTACKED
211-122425-0022 THAT IS TRUE SIRE THERE CAN BE NO MORE DOUBT ON THAT HEAD THEY CALLED UPON HIM THEN TO RETIRE BUT HE ANSWERED THAT HE WAS A MUSKETEER AT HEART ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO YOUR MAJESTY
211-122425-0023 BRAVE YOUNG MAN MURMURED THE KING WELL HE DID REMAIN WITH THEM AND YOUR MAJESTY HAS IN HIM SO FIRM A CHAMPION THAT IT WAS HE WHO GAVE JUSSAC THE TERRIBLE SWORD THRUST WHICH HAS MADE THE CARDINAL SO ANGRY
211-122425-0024 HE WHO WOUNDED JUSSAC CRIED THE KING HE A BOY
211-122425-0025 IT IS AS I HAVE THE HONOR TO RELATE IT TO YOUR MAJESTY JUSSAC ONE OF THE FIRST SWORDSMEN IN THE KINGDOM WELL SIRE FOR ONCE HE FOUND HIS MASTER I WILL SEE THIS YOUNG MAN TREVILLE I WILL SEE HIM AND IF ANYTHING CAN BE DONE
211-122425-0026 IT IS USELESS TO LET THE CARDINAL KNOW YES SIRE YOU UNDERSTAND TREVILLE AN EDICT IS STILL AN EDICT IT IS FORBIDDEN TO FIGHT AFTER ALL BUT THIS ENCOUNTER SIRE IS QUITE OUT OF THE ORDINARY CONDITIONS OF A DUEL IT IS A BRAWL
211-122425-0027 THAT IS TRUE SAID THE KING BUT NEVER MIND TREVILLE COME STILL BY THE BACK STAIRCASE TREVILLE SMILED BUT AS IT WAS INDEED SOMETHING TO HAVE PREVAILED UPON THIS CHILD TO REBEL AGAINST HIS MASTER
211-122425-0028 HE SALUTED THE KING RESPECTFULLY AND WITH THIS AGREEMENT TOOK LEAVE OF HIM THAT EVENING THE THREE MUSKETEERS WERE INFORMED OF THE HONOR ACCORDED THEM AS THEY HAD LONG BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH THE KING THEY WERE NOT MUCH EXCITED
211-122425-0029 BUT D'ARTAGNAN WITH HIS GASCON IMAGINATION SAW IN IT HIS FUTURE FORTUNE AND PASSED THE NIGHT IN GOLDEN DREAMS
211-122425-0030 D'ARTAGNAN FOUND THE MUSKETEER DRESSED AND READY TO GO OUT AS THE HOUR TO WAIT UPON THE KING WAS NOT TILL TWELVE HE HAD MADE A PARTY WITH PORTHOS AND ARAMIS TO PLAY A GAME AT TENNIS
211-122425-0031 AND ALTHOUGH IGNORANT OF THE GAME WHICH HE HAD NEVER PLAYED HE ACCEPTED NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH HIS TIME FROM NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AS IT THEN SCARCELY WAS TILL TWELVE THE TWO MUSKETEERS WERE ALREADY THERE AND WERE PLAYING TOGETHER
211-122425-0032 ALTHOUGH HE PLAYED WITH HIS LEFT HAND HE FOUND THAT HIS WOUND WAS YET TOO RECENT TO ALLOW OF SUCH EXERTION
211-122425-0033 AND AS HE DECLARED HE WAS TOO IGNORANT OF THE GAME TO PLAY IT REGULARLY THEY ONLY CONTINUED GIVING BALLS TO ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT COUNTING
211-122425-0034 PASSED SO CLOSE TO D'ARTAGNAN'S FACE
211-122425-0035 HIS AUDIENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN PROBABLY LOST AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE KING NOW AS UPON THIS AUDIENCE IN HIS GASCON IMAGINATION DEPENDED HIS FUTURE LIFE HE SALUTED ARAMIS AND PORTHOS POLITELY
211-122425-0036 DECLARING THAT HE WOULD NOT RESUME THE GAME UNTIL HE SHOULD BE PREPARED TO PLAY WITH THEM ON MORE EQUAL TERMS
211-122425-0037 LOOK AT ME AS LONG AS YOU LIKE MY LITTLE GENTLEMAN I HAVE SAID WHAT I HAVE SAID
211-122425-0038 YOU'RE IN THE WRONG THERE FOR IF YOU KNEW MY NAME PERHAPS YOU WOULD NOT BE SO PRESSING WHAT IS YOUR NAME
211-122425-0039 LEST IT BE OBSERVED THAT WE GO OUT TOGETHER YOU MUST BE AWARE THAT FOR OUR UNDERTAKING COMPANY WOULD BE IN THE WAY THAT'S TRUE SAID THE GUARDSMAN ASTONISHED THAT HIS NAME HAD NOT PRODUCED MORE EFFECT UPON THE YOUNG MAN
211-122425-0040 THAT THEY DID NOT EVEN PERCEIVE THEIR YOUNG COMPANION GO OUT WHO AS HE HAD TOLD THE GUARDSMAN OF HIS EMINENCE STOPPED OUTSIDE THE DOOR AN INSTANT AFTER THE GUARDSMAN DESCENDED IN HIS TURN
211-122425-0041 WHICH WAS FIXED FOR MIDDAY HE CAST HIS EYES AROUND AND SEEING THAT THE STREET WAS EMPTY SAID TO HIS ADVERSARY MY FAITH IT IS FORTUNATE FOR YOU ALTHOUGH YOUR NAME IS BERNAJOUX TO HAVE ONLY TO DEAL WITH AN APPRENTICE MUSKETEER
211-122425-0042 NEVER MIND BE CONTENT I WILL DO MY BEST ON GUARD BUT SAID HE WHOM D'ARTAGNAN THUS PROVOKED IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THIS PLACE IS BADLY CHOSEN AND THAT WE SHOULD BE BETTER
211-122425-0043 BERNAJOUX WAS NOT A MAN TO HAVE SUCH A COMPLIMENT PAID TO HIM TWICE IN AN INSTANT HIS SWORD GLITTERED IN HIS HAND AND HE SPRANG UPON HIS ADVERSARY WHOM
211-122425-0044 HE HOPED TO INTIMIDATE BUT D'ARTAGNAN HAD ON THE PRECEDING DAY SERVED HIS APPRENTICESHIP FRESH SHARPENED BY HIS VICTORY FULL OF HOPES OF FUTURE FAVOR HE WAS RESOLVED NOT TO RECOIL A STEP SO THE TWO SWORDS WERE CROSSED CLOSE TO THE HILTS
211-122425-0045 AND AS D'ARTAGNAN STOOD FIRM IT WAS HIS ADVERSARY WHO MADE THE RETREATING STEP BUT D'ARTAGNAN SEIZED THE MOMENT AT WHICH IN THIS MOVEMENT THE SWORD OF BERNAJOUX DEVIATED FROM THE LINE HE FREED HIS WEAPON MADE A LUNGE AND TOUCHED HIS ADVERSARY ON THE SHOULDER
211-122425-0046 IN WHOSE SERVICE HE HAD A RELATIVE
211-122425-0047 AND PRESSING HIM WARMLY WITHOUT DOUBT WOULD SOON HAVE COMPLETED HIS WORK WITH A THIRD BLOW WHEN THE NOISE WHICH AROSE FROM THE STREET BEING HEARD IN THE TENNIS COURT TWO OF THE FRIENDS OF THE GUARDSMAN WHO HAD SEEN HIM GO OUT AFTER EXCHANGING SOME WORDS WITH D'ARTAGNAN RUSHED SWORD IN HAND FROM THE COURT AND FELL UPON THE CONQUEROR
211-122425-0048 AND THE MOMENT THE TWO GUARDSMEN ATTACKED THEIR YOUNG COMPANION DROVE THEM BACK BERNAJOUX NOW FELL AND AS THE GUARDSMEN WERE ONLY TWO AGAINST FOUR THEY BEGAN TO CRY TO THE RESCUE
211-122425-0049 AT THESE CRIES ALL WHO WERE IN THE HOTEL RUSHED OUT AND FELL UPON THE FOUR COMPANIONS WHO ON THEIR SIDE CRIED ALOUD TO THE RESCUE MUSKETEERS THIS CRY WAS GENERALLY HEEDED
211-122425-0050 TO HIS EMINENCE THUS THE SOLDIERS OF OTHER COMPANIES THAN THOSE WHICH BELONGED TO THE RED DUKE AS ARAMIS HAD CALLED HIM OFTEN TOOK PART WITH THE KING'S MUSKETEERS IN THESE QUARRELS
211-122425-0051 TO THE RESCUE MUSKETEERS TO THE RESCUE
211-122425-0052 WHO HASTENED TO THE SUCCOR OF THEIR COMRADES THE MELEE BECAME GENERAL BUT STRENGTH WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE MUSKETEERS
211-122425-0053 THE DOORS OF WHICH THEY CLOSED JUST IN TIME TO PREVENT THEIR ENEMIES FROM ENTERING WITH THEM AS TO THE WOUNDED MAN HE HAD BEEN TAKEN IN AT ONCE AND AS WE HAVE SAID IN A VERY BAD STATE
211-122425-0054 EXCITEMENT WAS AT ITS HEIGHT AMONG THE MUSKETEERS AND THEIR ALLIES AND THEY EVEN BEGAN TO DELIBERATE WHETHER THEY SHOULD NOT SET FIRE TO THE HOTEL
211-122425-0055 DOMESTICS IN DARING TO MAKE A SORTIE UPON THE KING'S MUSKETEERS THE PROPOSITION HAD BEEN MADE AND RECEIVED WITH ENTHUSIASM WHEN FORTUNATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK STRUCK
211-122425-0056 THEY SUCCEEDED IN CALMING THEIR FRIENDS WHO CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH HURLING SOME PAVING STONES AGAINST THE GATES BUT THE GATES WERE TOO STRONG THEY SOON TIRED OF THE SPORT BESIDES THOSE WHO MUST BE CONSIDERED THE LEADERS OF THE ENTERPRISE HAD QUIT THE GROUP AND WERE MAKING THEIR WAY
211-122425-0057 WHO WAS WAITING FOR THEM ALREADY INFORMED OF THIS FRESH DISTURBANCE
211-122425-0058 AND LET US ENDEAVOR TO SEE THE KING BEFORE HE IS PREJUDICED BY THE CARDINAL
211-122425-0059 AND THE TWO WILL PASS OFF TOGETHER
211-122425-0060 DIRECTED HIS COURSE TOWARD THE LOUVRE BUT TO THE GREAT ASTONISHMENT OF THE CAPTAIN OF THE MUSKETEERS HE WAS INFORMED THAT THE KING HAD GONE STAG HUNTING IN THE FOREST OF SAINT GERMAIN
211-122425-0061 REQUIRED THIS INTELLIGENCE TO BE REPEATED TO HIM TWICE AND EACH TIME HIS COMPANIONS SAW HIS BROW BECOME DARKER HAD HIS MAJESTY ASKED HE ANY INTENTION OF HOLDING THIS HUNTING PARTY YESTERDAY NO YOUR EXCELLENCY
211-122425-0062 THE MASTER OF THE HOUNDS CAME THIS MORNING TO INFORM HIM THAT HE HAD MARKED DOWN A STAG AT FIRST THE KING ANSWERED THAT HE WOULD NOT GO BUT HE COULD NOT RESIST HIS LOVE OF SPORT AND SET OUT AFTER DINNER AND THE KING HAS SEEN THE CARDINAL
211-122425-0063 GENTLEMEN I WILL SEE THE KING THIS EVENING BUT AS TO YOU I DO NOT ADVISE YOU TO RISK DOING SO THIS ADVICE WAS TOO REASONABLE AND MOREOVER CAME FROM A MAN WHO KNEW THE KING TOO WELL TO ALLOW THE FOUR YOUNG MEN TO DISPUTE IT
211-122425-0064 EVERYONE TO RETURN HOME AND WAIT FOR NEWS
211-122425-0065 WITH A LETTER IN WHICH HE BEGGED OF HIM TO EJECT THE CARDINAL'S GUARDSMEN FROM HIS HOUSE AND TO REPRIMAND HIS PEOPLE FOR THEIR AUDACITY IN MAKING SORTIE AGAINST THE KING'S MUSKETEERS
211-122425-0066 WHOSE RELATIVE AS WE ALREADY KNOW BERNAJOUX WAS
211-122425-0067 BUT ON THE CONTRARY FOR HIM WHOSE PEOPLE THE MUSKETEERS HAD ASSAULTED AND WHOSE HOTEL THEY HAD ENDEAVORED TO BURN NOW AS THE DEBATE BETWEEN THESE TWO NOBLES MIGHT LAST A LONG TIME EACH BECOMING NATURALLY MORE FIRM IN HIS OWN OPINION
211-122425-0068 HE REPAIRED THEREFORE IMMEDIATELY TO HIS HOTEL AND CAUSED HIMSELF TO BE ANNOUNCED THE TWO NOBLES SALUTED EACH OTHER POLITELY FOR IF NO FRIENDSHIP EXISTED BETWEEN THEM THERE WAS AT LEAST ESTEEM BOTH WERE MEN OF COURAGE AND HONOR
211-122425-0069 WE FANCY THAT WE HAVE EACH CAUSE TO COMPLAIN OF THE OTHER AND I AM COME TO ENDEAVOR TO CLEAR UP THIS AFFAIR
211-122425-0070 AND ALL THE FAULT IS WITH YOUR MUSKETEERS
211-122425-0071 NOT TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL I AM ABOUT TO MAKE TO YOU
211-122425-0072 IN ADDITION TO THE SWORD THRUST IN HIS ARM WHICH IS NOT DANGEROUS
211-122425-0073 OF WHICH THE DOCTOR SAYS BAD THINGS
211-122425-0074 PERFECTLY DOES HE TALK WITH DIFFICULTY BUT HE CAN SPEAK
211-122425-0075 LET US ADJURE HIM IN THE NAME OF THE GOD BEFORE WHOM HE MUST PERHAPS APPEAR TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
211-122425-0076 THEN AS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SUGGEST A MORE REASONABLE PROPOSAL HE AGREED TO IT BOTH DESCENDED TO THE CHAMBER IN WHICH THE WOUNDED MAN LAY THE LATTER ON SEEING THESE TWO NOBLE LORDS WHO CAME TO VISIT HIM ENDEAVORED TO RAISE HIMSELF UP IN HIS BED
211-122425-0077 PLACED BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH AS BERNAJOUX WAS HE HAD NO IDEA FOR A MOMENT OF CONCEALING THE TRUTH AND HE DESCRIBED TO THE TWO NOBLES THE AFFAIR EXACTLY AS IT HAD PASSED
211-122425-0078 RETURNED TO HIS HOTEL AND IMMEDIATELY SENT WORD TO THE FOUR FRIENDS THAT HE AWAITED THEIR COMPANY AT DINNER
211-122425-0079 THAT HIS EMINENCE'S GUARDSMEN HAD RECEIVED
211-122425-0080 NOT ONLY AS GOOD COMRADES BUT AS MEN WHO HAD SO OFTEN HAD THEIR TURN THAT THEY COULD VERY WELL AFFORD HIM HIS
211-122425-0081 HIS EYES THEREFORE WERE FIXED IN A SORT OF AGONY UPON THE DOOR THROUGH WHICH THE KING MUST ENTER
211-122442-0000 HE FOUND THE DOOR OF HIS PASSAGE OPEN SPRANG UP THE STAIRS AND KNOCKED SOFTLY IN A MANNER AGREED UPON BETWEEN HIM AND HIS LACKEY
211-122442-0001 WHOM HE HAD SENT HOME TWO HOURS BEFORE FROM THE HOTEL DE VILLE TELLING HIM TO SIT UP FOR HIM OPENED THE DOOR FOR HIM THE READER MAY ASK
211-122442-0002 WHEN HE WAS LEFT STIFF AS A RUSH IN LONDON IN THE INTERVENING TIME BUCKINGHAM PERHAPS SENT HIM TO PARIS AS HE DID THE HORSES HAS ANYONE BROUGHT A LETTER FOR ME ASKED D'ARTAGNAN EAGERLY
211-122442-0003 BUT ONE HAS COME OF ITSELF WHAT DO YOU MEAN BLOCKHEAD I MEAN TO SAY THAT WHEN I CAME IN ALTHOUGH I HAD THE KEY OF YOUR APARTMENT IN MY POCKET
211-122442-0004 I FOUND A LETTER ON THE GREEN TABLE COVER IN YOUR BEDROOM AND WHERE IS THAT LETTER
211-122442-0005 IT IS NOT NATURAL FOR LETTERS TO ENTER PEOPLE'S HOUSES IN THIS MANNER IF THE WINDOW HAD BEEN OPEN OR EVEN AJAR I SHOULD THINK NOTHING OF IT BUT NO ALL WAS HERMETICALLY SEALED
211-122442-0006 THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME MAGIC UNDERNEATH MEANWHILE THE YOUNG MAN HAD DARTED IN TO HIS CHAMBER AND OPENED THE LETTER
211-122442-0007 THERE ARE MANY THANKS TO BE OFFERED TO YOU AND TO BE TRANSMITTED TO YOU BE THIS EVENING ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AT SAINT CLOUD
211-122442-0008 WHILE READING THIS LETTER D'ARTAGNAN FELT HIS HEART DILATED AND COMPRESSED BY THAT DELICIOUS SPASM WHICH TORTURES AND CARESSES THE HEARTS OF LOVERS IT WAS THE FIRST BILLET HE HAD RECEIVED IT WAS THE FIRST RENDEZVOUS THAT HAD BEEN GRANTED HIM
211-122442-0009 HIS HEART SWELLED BY THE INTOXICATION OF JOY FELT READY TO DISSOLVE AWAY AT THE VERY GATE OF THAT TERRESTRIAL PARADISE CALLED LOVE
211-122442-0010 DID I NOT GUESS TRULY IS IT NOT SOME BAD AFFAIR
211-122442-0011 EXACTLY BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT LETTERS WHICH COME IN THIS WAY INTO SHUT UP HOUSES FALL FROM HEAVEN MY FRIEND FALL FROM HEAVEN
211-122442-0012 MY DEAR PLANCHET I AM THE HAPPIEST OF MEN
211-122442-0013 WHICH THE LIBERALITY OF D'ARTAGNAN HAD NOT ENTIRELY EFFACED LEFT ALONE D'ARTAGNAN READ AND REREAD HIS BILLET THEN HE KISSED AND REKISSED TWENTY TIMES THE LINES TRACED BY THE HAND OF HIS BEAUTIFUL MISTRESS
211-122442-0014 AT LENGTH HE WENT TO BED FELL ASLEEP AND HAD GOLDEN DREAMS

211-122442-0020 PERHAPS THERE IS BUT ONE AT THIS MOMENT BUT BY THIS EVENING THERE WILL BE FOUR IT APPEARS THAT OUR JOURNEY WAS A REMOUNTING JOURNEY THEN EXACTLY SO SAID D'ARTAGNAN AND NODDING TO PLANCHET HE WENT OUT
211-122442-0021 D'ARTAGNAN'S INTENTION WAS TO GO OUT WITHOUT SPEAKING TO THE WORTHY MERCER BUT THE LATTER MADE SO POLITE AND FRIENDLY A SALUTATION THAT HIS TENANT FELT OBLIGED NOT ONLY TO STOP BUT TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION WITH HIM
211-122442-0022 BESIDES HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO AVOID A LITTLE CONDESCENSION TOWARD A HUSBAND WHOSE PRETTY WIFE HAS APPOINTED A MEETING WITH YOU THAT SAME EVENING AT SAINT CLOUD
211-122442-0023 THE CONVERSATION NATURALLY FELL UPON THE INCARCERATION OF THE POOR MAN
211-122442-0024 WHOM HE NEVER CEASED TO DESIGNATE DURING HIS ACCOUNT BY THE TITLE OF THE CARDINAL'S EXECUTIONER AND EXPATIATED AT GREAT LENGTH UPON THE BASTILLE THE BOLTS THE WICKETS THE DUNGEONS THE GRATINGS THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
211-122442-0025 D'ARTAGNAN LISTENED TO HIM WITH EXEMPLARY COMPLAISANCE AND WHEN HE HAD FINISHED SAID AND MADAME BONACIEUX DO YOU KNOW WHO CARRIED HER OFF FOR I DO NOT FORGET THAT I OWE TO THAT UNPLEASANT CIRCUMSTANCE THE GOOD FORTUNE OF HAVING MADE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE

211-122442-0079 BUT WHY THIS QUESTION BECAUSE WHILE YOU WERE TALKING WITH HIM I WATCHED YOU WITHOUT LISTENING TO YOU
211-122442-0080 TWO OR THREE TIMES BAH PREOCCUPIED AS MONSIEUR WAS WITH THE LETTER HE HAD RECEIVED HE DID NOT OBSERVE THAT BUT I WHOM THE STRANGE FASHION IN WHICH THAT LETTER CAME INTO THE HOUSE HAD PLACED ON MY GUARD I DID NOT LOSE A MOVEMENT OF HIS FEATURES
211-122442-0081 AND YOU FOUND IT TRAITOROUS MONSIEUR INDEED
211-122442-0082 SHUT HIS DOOR AND SET OFF AT A QUICK PACE IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION
211-122442-0083 HEAVED A PROFOUND SIGH AND SET TO WORK TO GROOM THE THIRD HORSE
2136-5140-0000 AS ALREADY DETAILED THAT I WAS ONE NIGHT SITTING AT THE GREAT DRAWING ROOM WINDOW LOST IN THE MELANCHOLY REVERIES OF NIGHT AND IN ADMIRATION OF THE MOONLIGHTED SCENE I WAS THE ONLY OCCUPANT OF THE ROOM
2136-5140-0001 HARDLY REACHED TO THE WINDOW AT WHICH I SAT THE SHORN GRASS SLOPED GENTLY DOWNWARD FROM THE WINDOWS TILL IT MET THE BROAD LEVEL ON WHICH STOOD IN CLUMPS OR SOLITARILY SCATTERED SOME OF THE NOBLEST TIMBER IN ENGLAND
2136-5140-0002 HOAR IN THE MOONBEAMS STOOD THOSE GRACEFUL TREES CASTING THEIR MOVELESS SHADOWS UPON THE GRASS AND IN THE BACKGROUND CROWNING THE UNDULATIONS OF THE DISTANCE IN MASSES WERE PILED THOSE WOODS AMONG WHICH LAY THE SOLITARY TOMB
2136-5140-0003 TO ME FUNEREAL BUT GLORIOUS WOODS WHICH FORMED THE BACKGROUND OF THE PICTURE MY THOUGHTS RECURRED TO MY FATHER'S MYSTERIOUS INTIMATIONS AND THE IMAGE OF THE APPROACHING VISITOR AND THE THOUGHT OF THE UNKNOWN JOURNEY SADDENED ME
2136-5140-0004 IN ALL THAT CONCERNED HIS RELIGION FROM VERY EARLY ASSOCIATION THERE WAS TO ME SOMETHING OF THE UNEARTHLY AND SPECTRAL WHEN MY DEAR MAMMA DIED I WAS NOT NINE YEARS OLD AND I REMEMBER TWO DAYS BEFORE THE FUNERAL
2136-5140-0005 THERE CAME TO KNOWL WHERE SHE DIED A THIN LITTLE MAN WITH LARGE BLACK EYES AND A VERY GRAVE DARK FACE HE WAS SHUT UP A GOOD DEAL WITH MY DEAR FATHER WHO WAS IN DEEP AFFLICTION AND MISSUS RUSK USED TO SAY
2136-5140-0006 AND GOOD MISTER CLAY READY AT CALL IN THE VILLAGE MUCH GOOD THAT LITTLE BLACK WHIPPER SNAPPER WILL DO HIM WITH THAT LITTLE BLACK MAN ON THE DAY AFTER THE FUNERAL I WAS SENT OUT FOR SOME REASON FOR A WALK MY GOVERNESS WAS ILL I KNOW
2136-5140-0007 AND THERE WAS CONFUSION IN THE HOUSE AND I DARE SAY THE MAIDS MADE AS MUCH OF A HOLIDAY AS THEY COULD I REMEMBER FEELING A SORT OF AWE OF THIS LITTLE DARK MAN BUT I WAS NOT AFRAID OF HIM FOR HE WAS GENTLE THOUGH SAD AND SEEMED KIND
2136-5140-0008 HE LED ME INTO THE GARDEN THE DUTCH GARDEN WE USED TO CALL IT WITH A BALUSTRADE AND STATUES AT THE FARTHER FRONT LAID OUT IN A CARPET PATTERN OF BRILLIANTLY COLOURED FLOWERS WE CAME DOWN THE BROAD FLIGHT OF CAEN STONE STEPS INTO THIS
2136-5140-0009 AND WE WALKED IN SILENCE TO THE BALUSTRADE THE BASE WAS TOO HIGH AT THE SPOT WHERE WE REACHED IT FOR ME TO SEE OVER BUT HOLDING MY HAND HE SAID
2136-5140-0010 WELL YOU CAN'T BUT I CAN SEE BEYOND IT SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT I SEE EVER SO MUCH I SEE A COTTAGE WITH A STEEP ROOF THAT LOOKS LIKE GOLD IN THE SUNLIGHT
2136-5140-0011 GROWING BY THE WALLS AND WINDOWS AND TWO LITTLE CHILDREN ARE PLAYING AMONG THE STEMS OF THE TREES AND WE ARE ON OUR WAY THERE AND IN A FEW MINUTES SHALL BE UNDER THOSE TREES OURSELVES AND TALKING TO THOSE LITTLE CHILDREN
2136-5140-0012 YET NOW TO ME IT IS BUT A PICTURE IN MY BRAIN AND TO YOU BUT A STORY TOLD BY ME WHICH YOU BELIEVE COME DEAR LET US BE GOING SO WE DESCENDED THE STEPS AT THE RIGHT
2136-5140-0013 AND THERE WE STOOD IN RICH SUNLIGHT AMONG THE MANY OBJECTS HE HAD DESCRIBED IS THIS YOUR HOUSE MY LITTLE MEN HE ASKED OF THE CHILDREN PRETTY LITTLE ROSY BOYS WHO ASSENTED AND HE LEANED WITH HIS OPEN HAND AGAINST THE STEM OF ONE OF THE TREES
2136-5140-0014 THE SAME ON WHICH I WAS NOW LOOKING IN THE DISTANCE EVERY NOW AND THEN HE MADE ME SIT DOWN TO REST
2136-5140-0015 WOULD RELATE SOME LITTLE STORY REFLECTING EVEN TO MY CHILDISH MIND A STRANGE SUSPICION OF A SPIRITUAL MEANING
2136-5140-0016 AND SOMEHOW STARTLING IN ITS VERY VAGUENESS THUS ENTERTAINED THOUGH A LITTLE AWFULLY I ACCOMPANIED THE DARK MYSTERIOUS LITTLE WHIPPER SNAPPER THROUGH THE WOODLAND GLADES
2136-5140-0017 WE CAME TO ME QUITE UNEXPECTEDLY IN THE DEEP SYLVAN SHADOWS UPON THE GREY PILLARED TEMPLE FOUR FRONTED WITH A SLANTING PEDESTAL OF LICHEN STAINED STEPS
2136-5140-0018 THE LONELY SEPULCHRE IN WHICH I HAD THE MORNING BEFORE SEEN POOR MAMMA LAID AT THE SIGHT THE FOUNTAINS OF MY GRIEF REOPENED AND I CRIED BITTERLY REPEATING OH MAMMA MAMMA LITTLE MAMMA
2136-5140-0019 AND SO WENT ON WEEPING AND CALLING WILDLY ON THE DEAF AND THE SILENT THERE WAS A STONE BENCH SOME TEN STEPS AWAY FROM THE TOMB SIT DOWN BESIDE ME MY CHILD SAID THE GRAVE MAN WITH THE BLACK EYES VERY KINDLY AND GENTLY
2136-5140-0020 NOW WHAT DO YOU SEE THERE HE ASKED POINTING HORIZONTALLY WITH HIS STICK TOWARDS THE CENTRE OF THE OPPOSITE STRUCTURE OH THAT THAT PLACE WHERE POOR MAMMA IS
2136-5140-0021 YES A STONE WALL WITH PILLARS TOO HIGH FOR EITHER YOU OR ME TO SEE OVER BUT HERE HE MENTIONED A NAME WHICH I THINK MUST HAVE BEEN SWEDENBORG
2136-5140-0022 I ONLY KNOW THAT IT SOUNDED TO ME LIKE THE NAME OF A MAGICIAN IN A FAIRY TALE I FANCIED HE LIVED IN THE WOOD WHICH SURROUNDED US AND I BEGAN TO GROW FRIGHTENED AS HE PROCEEDED BUT SWEDENBORG SEES BEYOND IT OVER AND THROUGH IT
2136-5140-0023 AND HAS TOLD ME ALL THAT CONCERNS US TO KNOW HE SAYS YOUR MAMMA IS NOT THERE SHE IS TAKEN AWAY I CRIED STARTING UP AND WITH STREAMING EYES GAZING ON THE BUILDING WHICH THOUGH I STAMPED MY FEET IN MY DISTRACTION
2136-5140-0024 I WAS AFRAID TO APPROACH OH IS MAMMA TAKEN AWAY WHERE IS SHE WHERE HAVE THEY BROUGHT HER TO I WAS UTTERING UNCONSCIOUSLY VERY NEARLY THE QUESTION WITH WHICH MARY
2136-5140-0025 IN THE GREY OF THAT WONDROUS MORNING ON WHICH SHE STOOD BY THE EMPTY SEPULCHRE ACCOSTED THE FIGURE STANDING NEAR YOUR MAMMA IS ALIVE BUT TOO FAR AWAY TO SEE OR HEAR US SWEDENBORG STANDING HERE CAN SEE AND HEAR HER
2136-5140-0026 AND TELLS ME ALL HE SEES JUST AS I TOLD YOU IN THE GARDEN ABOUT THE LITTLE BOYS AND THE COTTAGE AND THE TREES AND FLOWERS WHICH YOU COULD NOT SEE
2136-5140-0027 SO I CAN TELL YOU NOW AS I DID THEN AND AS WE ARE BOTH I HOPE WALKING ON TO THE SAME PLACE JUST AS WE DID TO THE TREES AND COTTAGE
2136-5140-0028 HOW TRUE THE DESCRIPTION IS WHICH I GIVE YOU I WAS VERY FRIGHTENED FOR I FEARED THAT WHEN HE HAD DONE HIS NARRATIVE
2136-5140-0029 AND OF SHADOWS WHERE THE DEAD WERE VISIBLE HE LEANED HIS ELBOW ON HIS KNEE AND HIS FOREHEAD ON HIS HAND WHICH SHADED HIS DOWNCAST EYES IN THAT ATTITUDE HE DESCRIBED TO ME A BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE
2136-5140-0030 RADIANT WITH A WONDROUS LIGHT IN WHICH REJOICING MY MOTHER MOVED ALONG AN AIRY PATH ASCENDING AMONG MOUNTAINS OF FANTASTIC HEIGHT AND PEAKS MELTING IN CELESTIAL COLOURING INTO THE AIR
2136-5140-0031 HE SAID THE SAME WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN BEFORE COME DEAR LET US GO OH NO NO NO NOT NOW I SAID RESISTING AND VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED HOME I MEAN DEAR
2136-5140-0032 WE CANNOT WALK TO THE PLACE I HAVE DESCRIBED WE CAN ONLY REACH IT THROUGH THE GATE OF DEATH TO WHICH WE ARE ALL TENDING YOUNG AND OLD WITH SURE STEPS AND WHERE IS THE GATE OF DEATH I ASKED IN A SORT OF WHISPER AS WE WALKED TOGETHER
2136-5140-0033 HOLDING HIS HAND AND LOOKING STEALTHILY HE SMILED SADLY AND SAID WHEN SOONER OR LATER THE TIME COMES AS HAGAR'S EYES WERE OPENED IN THE WILDERNESS AND SHE BEHELD THE FOUNTAIN OF WATER
2136-5140-0034 SO SHALL EACH OF US SEE THE DOOR OPEN BEFORE US AND ENTER IN AND BE REFRESHED FOR A LONG TIME FOLLOWING THIS WALK I WAS VERY NERVOUS MORE SO FOR THE AWFUL MANNER IN WHICH MISSUS RUSK RECEIVED MY STATEMENT
2136-5140-0035 WITH STERN LIPS AND UPTURNED HANDS AND EYES AND AN ANGRY EXPOSTULATION I DO WONDER AT YOU MARY QUINCE LETTING THE CHILD WALK INTO THE WOOD WITH THAT LIMB OF DARKNESS IT IS A MERCY HE DID NOT SHOW HER THE DEVIL
2136-5140-0036 OR FRIGHTEN HER OUT OF HER SENSES IN THAT LONELY PLACE OF THESE SWEDENBORGIANS INDEED I KNOW NO MORE THAN I MIGHT LEARN FROM GOOD MISSUS RUSK'S VERY INACCURATE TALK TWO OR THREE OF THEM CROSSED IN THE COURSE OF MY EARLY LIFE
2136-5140-0037 BUT I GREW AFTER A DAY OR TWO SO NERVOUS THAT I LAID IT ASIDE IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME TO KNOW THAT THEIR FOUNDER EITHER SAW OR FANCIED HE SAW AMAZING VISIONS WHICH SO FAR FROM SUPERSEDING CONFIRMED
2136-5140-0038 AND INTERPRETED THE LANGUAGE OF THE BIBLE AND AS DEAR PAPA ACCEPTED THEIR IDEAS I AM HAPPY IN THINKING THAT THEY DID NOT CONFLICT WITH THE SUPREME AUTHORITY OF HOLY WRIT LEANING ON MY HAND I WAS NOW LOOKING UPON THAT SOLEMN WOOD
2136-5140-0039 WHITE AND SHADOWY IN THE MOONLIGHT WHERE FOR A LONG TIME AFTER THAT RAMBLE WITH THE VISIONARY I FANCIED THE GATE OF DEATH HIDDEN ONLY BY A STRANGE GLAMOUR AND THE DAZZLING LAND OF GHOSTS WERE SITUATE
2136-5140-0040 AND I SUPPOSE THESE EARLIER ASSOCIATIONS GAVE TO MY REVERIE ABOUT MY FATHER'S COMING VISITOR
2136-5143-0000 CHAPTER SIX A WALK IN THE WOOD TWO LITTLE PIECES OF BY PLAY IN WHICH I DETECTED HER CONFIRMED MY UNPLEASANT SUSPICION FROM THE CORNER OF THE GALLERY I ONE DAY SAW HER WHEN SHE THOUGHT I WAS OUT AND ALL QUIET
2136-5143-0001 WITH HER EAR AT THE KEYHOLE OF PAPA'S STUDY
2136-5143-0002 HER EYES WERE TURNED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE STAIRS FROM WHICH ONLY SHE APPREHENDED SURPRISE HER GREAT MOUTH WAS OPEN AND HER EYES ABSOLUTELY GOGGLED WITH EAGERNESS SHE WAS DEVOURING ALL THAT WAS PASSING THERE
2136-5143-0003 INDIGNATION HOWEVER QUICKLY RETURNED AND I CAME BACK TREADING BRISKLY AS I DID SO WHEN I REACHED THE ANGLE OF THE GALLERY AGAIN MADAME I SUPPOSE HAD HEARD ME FOR SHE WAS HALF WAY DOWN THE STAIRS
2136-5143-0004 I AM SO GLAD TO FIND YOU AND YOU ARE DRESS TO COME OUT WE SHALL HAVE SO PLEASANT WALK AT THAT MOMENT THE DOOR OF MY FATHER'S STUDY OPENED AND MISSUS RUSK WITH HER DARK ENERGETIC FACE VERY MUCH FLUSHED STEPPED OUT IN HIGH EXCITEMENT

2136-5143-0010 AND SOME DROPS OF LAUDANUM WHENEVER THE PAIN OF STOMACH RETURNED
2136-5143-0011 SHE CLAIMED HER MEDICINE MAN'S ESTIMATE OF WOMAN IS HIGHER THAN WOMAN'S OWN PERHAPS IN THEIR RELATIONS TO MEN THEY ARE GENERALLY MORE TRUSTWORTHY PERHAPS WOMAN'S IS THE JUSTER AND THE OTHER AN APPOINTED ILLUSION
2136-5143-0012 I DON'T KNOW BUT SO IT IS ORDAINED MISSUS RUSK WAS RECALLED AND I SAW AS YOU ARE AWARE MADAME'S PROCEDURE DURING THE INTERVIEW IT WAS A GREAT BATTLE A GREAT VICTORY MADAME WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS

2136-5147-0027 AND THOUGH YOU WOULD NOT HAVE HER THEN SHE HAS HAD HER SECOND HUSBAND SINCE I CAN TELL YOU I'M GLAD I WAS NOT THE FIRST SAID MY FATHER WELL THEY REALLY SAY HER WEALTH IS ABSOLUTELY IMMENSE HER LAST HUSBAND
2136-5147-0028 THE RUSSIAN MERCHANT LEFT HER EVERYTHING SHE HAS NOT A HUMAN RELATION AND SHE IS IN THE BEST SET YOU WERE ALWAYS A MATCH MAKER MONICA SAID MY FATHER STOPPING AND PUTTING HIS HAND KINDLY ON HERS
2136-5147-0029 BUT IT WON'T DO NO NO MONICA WE MUST TAKE CARE OF LITTLE MAUD SOME OTHER WAY I WAS RELIEVED WE WOMEN HAVE ALL AN INSTINCTIVE DREAD OF SECOND MARRIAGES
2136-5147-0030 AND THINK THAT NO WIDOWER IS QUITE ABOVE OR BELOW THAT DANGER AND I REMEMBER WHENEVER MY FATHER WHICH INDEED WAS BUT SELDOM MADE A VISIT TO TOWN OR ANYWHERE ELSE IT WAS A SAYING OF MISSUS RUSK
2136-5147-0031 I SHAN'T WONDER NEITHER NEED YOU MY DEAR IF HE BRINGS HOME A YOUNG WIFE WITH HIM SO MY FATHER WITH A KIND LOOK AT HER AND A VERY TENDER ONE ON ME WENT SILENTLY TO THE LIBRARY AS HE OFTEN DID ABOUT THAT HOUR
2136-5147-0032 I SUPPOSE THEY DID NOT WISH A REVOLUTION AND ALL ITS CONSEQUENCES AT KNOWL AND THOUGHT IT NO HARM TO EXCITE MY VIGILANCE BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE LONG TO BE VEXED WITH COUSIN MONICA
2136-5147-0033 YOU KNOW MY DEAR YOUR FATHER IS AN ODDITY SHE SAID I DON'T MIND HIM I NEVER DID YOU MUST NOT CRACKY MY DEAR CRACKY DECIDEDLY CRACKY AND SHE TAPPED THE CORNER OF HER FOREHEAD WITH A LOOK SO SLY AND COMICAL
2136-5147-0034 THAT I THINK I SHOULD HAVE LAUGHED IF THE SENTIMENT HAD NOT BEEN SO AWFULLY IRREVERENT WELL DEAR HOW IS OUR FRIEND THE MILLINER MADAME IS SUFFERING SO MUCH FROM PAIN IN HER EAR THAT SHE SAYS IT WOULD BE QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE THE HONOUR HONOUR FIDDLE
2136-5147-0035 PAIN IN HER EAR YOU SAY POOR THING WELL DEAR I THINK I CAN CURE THAT IN FIVE MINUTES I HAVE IT MYSELF NOW AND THEN COME TO MY ROOM AND WE'LL GET THE BOTTLES SO SHE LIGHTED HER CANDLE IN THE LOBBY AND WITH A LIGHT AND AGILE STEP
2136-5147-0036 SHE SCALED THE STAIRS I FOLLOWING AND HAVING FOUND THE REMEDIES WE APPROACHED MADAME'S ROOM TOGETHER I THINK WHILE WE WERE STILL AT THE END OF THE GALLERY MADAME HEARD AND DIVINED OUR APPROACH FOR HER DOOR SUDDENLY SHUT
2136-5147-0037 AND THERE WAS A FUMBLING AT THE HANDLE BUT THE BOLT WAS OUT OF ORDER
2136-5147-0038 THERE WAS NO ANSWER SO SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND WE BOTH ENTERED MADAME HAD ROLLED HERSELF IN THE BLUE COVERLET AND WAS LYING ON THE BED WITH HER FACE BURIED IN THE PILLOW AND ENVELOPED IN THE COVERING PERHAPS SHE'S ASLEEP SAID LADY KNOLLYS
2136-5147-0039 GETTING ROUND TO THE SIDE OF THE BED AND STOOPING OVER HER MADAME LAY STILL AS A MOUSE COUSIN MONICA SET DOWN HER TWO LITTLE VIALS ON THE TABLE AND STOOPING AGAIN OVER THE BED BEGAN VERY GENTLY WITH HER FINGERS TO LIFT THE COVERLET THAT COVERED HER FACE
2136-5147-0040 MADAME UTTERED A SLUMBERING MOAN AND TURNED MORE UPON HER FACE CLASPING THE COVERLET FASTER ABOUT HER MADAME IT IS MAUD AND LADY KNOLLYS WE HAVE COME TO RELIEVE YOUR EAR PRAY LET ME SEE IT
2159-179154-0000 COURTING A BROOMSTICK THE SIDE SHOW LET US NOW DESCRIBE SOME OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF HYPNOTISM TO SEE JUST HOW IT OPERATES AND HOW IT EXHIBITS ITSELF
2159-179154-0001 THE FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF A PUBLIC PERFORMANCE GIVEN BY DOCTOR HERBERT L FLINT A VERY SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC OPERATOR IT IS IN THE LANGUAGE OF AN EYE WITNESS A NEW YORK LAWYER
2159-179154-0002 IN RESPONSE TO A CALL FOR VOLUNTEERS TWENTY YOUNG AND MIDDLE AGED MEN CAME UPON THE STAGE THEY EVIDENTLY BELONGED TO THE GREAT MIDDLE CLASS THE ENTERTAINMENT COMMENCED BY DOCTOR FLINT PASSING AROUND THE GROUP
2159-179154-0003 WHO WERE SEATED ON THE STAGE IN A SEMICIRCLE FACING THE AUDIENCE AND STROKING EACH ONE'S HEAD AND FOREHEAD REPEATING THE PHRASES CLOSE YOUR EYES THINK OF NOTHING BUT SLEEP YOU ARE VERY TIRED YOU ARE DROWSY
2159-179154-0004 YOU FEEL VERY SLEEPY AS HE DID THIS SEVERAL OF THE VOLUNTEERS CLOSED THEIR EYES AT ONCE AND ONE FELL ASLEEP IMMEDIATELY ONE OR TWO REMAINED AWAKE
2159-179154-0005 WHILE A FEW WERE WIDE AWAKE AND SMILING AT THE REST THESE LATTER WERE DISMISSED AS UNLIKELY SUBJECTS WHEN THE STAGE HAD BEEN CLEARED OF ALL THOSE WHO WERE NOT RESPONSIVE THE DOCTOR PASSED AROUND AND SNAPPING HIS FINGER
2159-179154-0006 AT EACH INDIVIDUAL AWOKE HIM ONE OF THE SUBJECTS WHEN QUESTIONED AFTERWARD AS TO WHAT SENSATION HE EXPERIENCED AT THE SNAPPING OF THE FINGERS REPLIED THAT IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF SOMETHING INSIDE OF HIS HEAD RESPONDED
2159-179154-0007 AND WITH THIS SENSATION HE REGAINED SELF CONSCIOUSNESS THIS IS TO BE DOUBTED AS A RULE SUBJECTS IN THIS STAGE OF HYPNOTISM DO NOT FEEL ANY SENSATION THAT THEY CAN REMEMBER
2159-179154-0008 THAT YOU CAN'T PULL THEM APART THEY ARE FAST YOU CANNOT PULL THEM APART TRY YOU CAN'T THE WHOLE CLASS MADE FRANTIC EFFORTS TO UNCLASP THEIR HANDS BUT WERE UNABLE TO DO SO THE DOCTOR'S EXPLANATION OF THIS IS
2159-179154-0009 THAT WHAT THEY WERE REALLY DOING WAS TO FORCE THEIR HANDS CLOSER TOGETHER THUS OBEYING THE COUNTER SUGGESTION THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE TRYING TO UNCLASP THEIR HANDS WAS EVIDENT FROM THEIR ENDEAVORS
2159-179154-0010 ONE YOUNG FELLOW AGED ABOUT EIGHTEEN SAID THAT HE WAS ADDICTED TO THE CIGARETTE HABIT THE SUGGESTION WAS MADE TO HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER THE ENTERTAINMENT HE WAS ASKED TO SMOKE AS WAS HIS USUAL HABIT
2159-179154-0011 HE WAS THEN AWAY FROM ANY ONE WHO COULD INFLUENCE HIM HE REPLIED THAT THE VERY IDEA WAS REPUGNANT HOWEVER HE WAS INDUCED TO TAKE A CIGARETTE IN HIS MOUTH BUT IT MADE HIM ILL AND HE FLUNG IT AWAY WITH EVERY EXPRESSION OF DISGUST
2159-179154-0012 THIS IS AN INSTANCE OF WHAT IS CALLED POST HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION DOCTOR COCKE TELLS OF SUGGESTING TO A DRINKER WHOM HE WAS TRYING TO CURE OF THE HABIT THAT FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS ANYTHING HE TOOK WOULD MAKE HIM VOMIT
2159-179154-0013 THEY IMMEDIATELY BEGAN AND TWIRLED THEM FASTER AND FASTER IN SPITE OF THEIR EFFORTS TO STOP ONE OF THE SUBJECTS SAID HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT THE STRANGE ACTION OF HIS HANDS AND SOMETIMES IT PUZZLED HIM TO KNOW WHY THEY WHIRLED
2159-179154-0014 AT THIS POINT DOCTOR FLINT'S DAUGHTER TOOK CHARGE OF THE CLASS SHE POINTED HER FINGER AT ONE OF THEM AND THE SUBJECT BEGAN TO LOOK STEADILY BEFORE HIM AT WHICH THE REST OF THE CLASS WERE HIGHLY AMUSED
2159-179154-0015 PRESENTLY THE SUBJECT'S HEAD LEANED FORWARD THE PUPILS OF HIS EYES DILATED AND ASSUMED A PECULIAR GLASSY STARE HE AROSE WITH A STEADY GLIDING GAIT
2159-179154-0016 THEN HE STOPPED MISS FLINT LED HIM TO THE FRONT OF THE STAGE AND LEFT HIM STANDING IN PROFOUND SLUMBER HE STOOD THERE STOOPING EYES SET AND VACANT FAST ASLEEP
2159-179154-0017 IN THE MEANTIME THE ACT HAD CAUSED GREAT LAUGHTER AMONG THE REST OF THE CLASS ONE YOUNG FELLOW IN PARTICULAR LAUGHED SO UPROARIOUSLY THAT TEARS COURSED DOWN HIS CHEEKS AND HE TOOK OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF TO WIPE HIS EYES
2159-179154-0018 JUST AS HE WAS RETURNING IT TO HIS POCKET THE LADY SUDDENLY POINTED A FINGER AT HIM
2159-179154-0019 BUT THE MOMENT THE GESTURE WAS MADE HIS COUNTENANCE FELL HIS MIRTH STOPPED WHILE THAT OF HIS COMPANIONS REDOUBLED AND THE CHANGE WAS SO OBVIOUS THAT THE AUDIENCE SHARED IN THE LAUGHTER BUT THE SUBJECT NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD
2159-179154-0020 HIS EYES ASSUMED THE SAME EXPRESSION THAT HAD BEEN NOTICED IN HIS COMPANION'S HE TOO AROSE IN THE SAME ATTITUDE AS IF HIS HEAD WERE PULLING THE BODY ALONG AND FOLLOWING THE FINGER IN THE SAME WAY AS HIS PREDECESSOR
2159-179154-0021 ANOTHER WAS GIVEN A BROOMSTICK AND TOLD TO HUNT GAME IN THE WOODS BEFORE HIM ANOTHER WAS GIVEN A LARGE RAG DOLL AND TOLD THAT IT WAS AN INFANT AND THAT HE MUST LOOK AMONG THE AUDIENCE AND DISCOVER THE FATHER
2159-179154-0022 HE WAS INFORMED THAT HE COULD TELL WHO THE FATHER WAS BY THE SIMILARITY AND THE COLOR OF THE EYES THESE SUGGESTIONS WERE MADE IN A LOUD TONE MISS FLINT BEING NO NEARER ONE SUBJECT THAN ANOTHER
2159-179154-0023 THE BARE SUGGESTION WAS GIVEN AS NOW THINK THAT YOU ARE A NEWSBOY AND ARE SELLING PAPERS OR NOW THINK THAT YOU ARE HUNTING AND ARE GOING INTO THE WOODS TO SHOOT BIRDS SO THE PARTY WAS STARTED
2159-179154-0024 AT THE SAME TIME INTO THE AUDIENCE THE ONE WHO WAS IMPERSONATING A NEWSBOY WENT ABOUT CRYING HIS EDITION IN A LOUD VOICE WHILE THE HUNTER CRAWLED ALONG STEALTHILY AND CAREFULLY
2159-179154-0025 THE NEWSBOY EVEN ADOPTED THE WELL WORN DEVICE OF ASKING THOSE WHOM HE SOLICITED TO BUY TO HELP HIM GET RID OF HIS STOCK ONE MAN OFFERED HIM A CENT WHEN THE PRICE WAS TWO CENTS THE NEWSBOY CHAFFED THE WOULD BE PURCHASER
2159-179154-0026 AND TAKING HIM INTO THE CENTER OF THE STAGE SHOWED HIM A SMALL RIDING WHIP HE LOOKED AT IT INDIFFERENTLY ENOUGH HE WAS TOLD IT WAS A HOT BAR OF IRON BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD STILL INCREDULOUS
2159-179154-0027 THE SUGGESTION WAS REPEATED AND AS THE GLAZED LOOK CAME INTO HIS EYES THE INCREDULOUS LOOK DIED OUT EVERY MEMBER OF THE CLASS WAS FOLLOWING THE SUGGESTION MADE TO THE SUBJECT IN HAND ALL OF THEM HAD THE SAME EXPRESSION IN THEIR EYES THE DOCTOR SAID
2159-179154-0028 THAT HIS DAUGHTER WAS HYPNOTIZING THE WHOLE CLASS THROUGH THIS ONE INDIVIDUAL AS SHE SPOKE SHE LIGHTLY TOUCHED THE SUBJECT WITH THE END OF THE WHIP THE MOMENT THE SUBJECT FELT THE WHIP HE JUMPED AND SHRIEKED AS IF IT REALLY WERE A HOT IRON
2159-179154-0029 SHE TOUCHED EACH ONE OF THE CLASS IN SUCCESSION AND EVERY ONE MANIFESTED THE UTMOST PAIN AND FEAR ONE SUBJECT SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND CRIED IN DIRE DISTRESS
2159-179154-0030 HAD THE SUGGESTION BEEN CONTINUED IT WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE RAISED A BLISTER ONE OF THE AMUSING EXPERIMENTS TRIED AT A LATER TIME WAS THAT OF A TALL YOUNG MAN DIFFIDENT PALE AND MODEST BEING GIVEN A BROOM CAREFULLY WRAPPED IN A SHEET
2159-179154-0031 AND TOLD THAT IT WAS HIS SWEETHEART HE ACCEPTED THE SITUATION AND SAT DOWN BY THE BROOM HE WAS A LITTLE SHEEPISH AT FIRST BUT EVENTUALLY HE GREW BOLDER AND SMILED UPON HER SUCH A SMILE AS MALVOLIO CASTS UPON OLIVIA
2159-179154-0032 THE MANNER IN WHICH LITTLE BY LITTLE HE VENTURED UPON A FAMILIAR FOOTING WAS EXCEEDINGLY FUNNY BUT WHEN IN A MOMENT OF CONFIDENT RESPONSE TO HIS WOOING HE CLASPED HER ROUND THE WAIST AND IMPRINTED A CHASTE KISS UPON THE BRUSHY PART OF THE BROOM
2159-179154-0033 DISGUISED BY THE SHEET THE HOUSE RESOUNDED WITH ROARS OF LAUGHTER THE SUBJECT HOWEVER WAS DEAF TO ALL OF THE NOISE HE WAS ABSORBED IN HIS COURTSHIP AND HE CONTINUED TO HUG THE BROOM AND EXHIBIT IN HIS FEATURES
2159-179154-0034 ALL THE WORLD LOVES A LOVER AS THE SAYING IS AND ALL THE WORLD LOVES TO LAUGH AT HIM ONE OF THE SUBJECTS WAS TOLD THAT THE HEAD OF A MAN IN THE AUDIENCE WAS ON FIRE
2159-179154-0035 HE LOOKED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN DASHED DOWN THE PLATFORM INTO THE AUDIENCE AND SEIZING THE MAN'S HEAD VIGOROUSLY RUBBED IT AS THIS DID NOT EXTINGUISH THE FLAMES HE TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND PUT THE FIRE OUT IN DOING THIS HE SET HIS COAT ON FIRE
2159-179154-0036 THEN HE CALMLY RESUMED HIS GARMENT AND WALKED BACK TO THE STAGE THE SIDE SHOW CLOSED THE EVENING'S ENTERTAINMENT A YOUNG MAN WAS TOLD TO THINK OF HIMSELF AS MANAGING A SIDE SHOW AT A CIRCUS
2159-179154-0037 WHEN HIS MIND HAD ABSORBED THIS IDEA HE WAS ORDERED TO OPEN HIS EXHIBITION HE AT ONCE MOUNTED A TABLE AND IN THE VOICE OF THE TRADITIONAL SIDE SHOW FAKIR BEGAN TO DILATE UPON THE FAT WOMAN AND THE SNAKES
2159-179154-0038 THAT FOR THE SMALL SUM OF TEN CENTS THEY COULD SEE MORE WONDERS THAN EVER BEFORE HAD BEEN CROWDED UNDER ONE CANVAS TENT HE HARANGUED THE CROWD AS THEY SURGED ABOUT THE TENT DOOR
2159-179154-0039 HE POINTED TO A SUPPOSITIOUS CANVAS PICTURE HE CHAFFED THE BOYS HE FLATTERED THE VANITY OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS WITH THEIR GIRLS TELLING THEM THAT THEY COULD NOT AFFORD FOR THE SMALL SUM OF TEN CENTS TO MISS THIS GREAT SHOW
2159-179156-0000 HOW THE SUBJECT FEELS UNDER HYPNOTIZATION DOCTOR COOPER'S EXPERIENCE EFFECT OF MUSIC DOCTOR ALFRED MARTHIEU'S EXPERIMENTS
2159-179156-0001 THE SENSATIONS PRODUCED DURING A STATE OF HYPNOSIS ARE VERY INTERESTING AS MAY BE SUPPOSED THEY DIFFER GREATLY IN DIFFERENT PERSONS
2159-179156-0002 ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING ACCOUNTS EVER GIVEN IS THAT OF DOCTOR JAMES R COCKE A HYPNOTIST HIMSELF WHO SUBMITTED TO BEING OPERATED UPON BY A PROFESSIONAL MAGNETIZER
2159-179156-0003 HE WAS AT THAT TIME A FIRM BELIEVER IN THE THEORY OF PERSONAL MAGNETISM A DELUSION FROM WHICH HE AFTERWARD ESCAPED ON THE OCCASION WHICH HE DESCRIBES THE OPERATOR COMMANDED HIM TO CLOSE HIS EYES
2159-179156-0004 BUT HE DID OPEN THEM AT ONCE AGAIN HE TOLD HIM TO CLOSE THE EYES AND AT THE SAME TIME HE GENTLY STROKED HIS HEAD AND FACE AND EYELIDS WITH HIS HAND DOCTOR COCKE FANCIED HE FELT A TINGLING SENSATION IN HIS FOREHEAD AND EYES
2159-179156-0005 WHICH HE SUPPOSED CAME FROM THE HAND OF THE OPERATOR AFTERWARD HE CAME TO BELIEVE THAT THIS SENSATION WAS PURELY IMAGINARY ON HIS PART THEN HE SAYS A SENSATION AKIN TO FEAR CAME OVER ME
2159-179156-0006 THE OPERATOR SAID YOU ARE GOING TO SLEEP YOU ARE GETTING SLEEPY YOU CANNOT OPEN YOUR EYES I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT MY HEART WAS BEATING RAPIDLY AND I FELT A SENSATION OF TERROR
2159-179156-0007 HE THEN MADE PASSES OVER MY HEAD DOWN OVER MY HANDS AND BODY BUT DID NOT TOUCH ME HE THEN SAID TO ME YOU CANNOT OPEN YOUR EYES THE MOTOR APPARATUS OF MY LIDS WOULD NOT SEEMINGLY RESPOND TO MY WILL
2159-179156-0008 YET I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT WHILE ONE PART OF MY MIND WANTED TO OPEN MY EYES ANOTHER PART DID NOT WANT TO SO I WAS IN A PARADOXICAL STATE I BELIEVED THAT I COULD OPEN MY EYES AND YET COULD NOT
2159-179156-0009 THE FEELING OF NOT WISHING TO OPEN MY EYES WAS NOT BASED UPON ANY DESIRE TO PLEASE THE OPERATOR I HAD NO PERSONAL INTEREST IN HIM IN ANY WAY BUT BE IT UNDERSTOOD I FIRMLY BELIEVED IN HIS POWER TO CONTROL ME
2159-179156-0010 THEN HE STROKED THE ARM AND SAID IT WAS GROWING NUMB HE SAID YOU HAVE NO FEELING IN IT HAVE YOU DOCTOR COCKE GOES ON I SAID NO AND I KNEW THAT I SAID NO
2159-179156-0011 THE OPERATOR WENT ON PRICKING THE ARM WITH A PIN AND THOUGH DOCTOR COCKE FELT THE PAIN HE SAID HE DID NOT FEEL IT AND AT THE SAME TIME THE SENSATION OF TERROR INCREASED I WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF MY BODY AT ALL HE SAYS FURTHER ON
2159-179156-0012 BUT I WAS PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS OF THE TWO CONTRADICTORY ELEMENTS WITHIN ME I KNEW THAT MY BODY EXISTED BUT COULD NOT PROVE IT TO MYSELF I KNEW THAT THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE OPERATOR WERE IN A MEASURE UNTRUE
2159-179156-0013 I OBEYED THEM VOLUNTARILY AND INVOLUNTARILY THIS IS THE LAST REMEMBRANCE THAT I HAVE OF THAT HYPNOTIC EXPERIENCE AFTER THIS HOWEVER THE OPERATOR CAUSED THE DOCTOR TO DO A NUMBER OF THINGS WHICH HE LEARNED OF FROM HIS FRIENDS AFTER THE PERFORMANCE WAS OVER
2159-179156-0014 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE HYPNOTIST COMMANDED ME TO AWAKE AS SOON AS I DROPPED MY ARM AND YET TEN MINUTES OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS HAD PASSED ON A SUBSEQUENT OCCASION DOCTOR COCKE WHO WAS BLIND WAS PUT INTO A DEEP HYPNOTIC SLEEP
2159-179156-0015 BY FIXING HIS MIND ON THE NUMBER TWENTY SIX AND HOLDING UP HIS HAND THIS TIME HE EXPERIENCED A STILL GREATER DEGREE OF TERROR AND INCIDENTALLY LEARNED THAT HE COULD HYPNOTIZE HIMSELF THE MATTER OF SELF HYPNOTISM
2159-179156-0016 WE SHALL CONSIDER IN ANOTHER CHAPTER IN THIS CONNECTION WE FIND GREAT INTEREST IN AN ARTICLE IN THE MEDICAL NEWS JULY TWENTY EIGHTH EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
2159-179156-0017 IN WHICH HE DESCRIBES THE EFFECTS OF MUSIC UPON HYPNOTIC SUBJECTS WHILE IN VIENNA HE TOOK OCCASION TO OBSERVE CLOSELY THE ENTHUSIASTIC MUSICAL DEVOTEES AS THEY SAT IN THE AUDIENCE AT THE PERFORMANCE OF ONE OF WAGNER'S OPERAS
2159-179156-0018 HE BELIEVED THEY WERE IN A CONDITION OF SELF INDUCED HYPNOTISM IN WHICH THEIR SUBJECTIVE FACULTIES WERE SO EXALTED AS TO SUPERSEDE THEIR OBJECTIVE PERCEPTIONS MUSIC WAS NO LONGER TO THEM A SUCCESSION OF PLEASING SOUNDS
2159-179156-0019 BUT THE EMBODIMENT OF A DRAMA IN WHICH THEY BECAME SO WRAPPED UP THAT THEY FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE MECHANICAL AND EXTERNAL FEATURES OF THE MUSIC AND LIVED COMPLETELY IN A FAIRY WORLD OF DREAM
2159-179156-0020 THIS OBSERVATION SUGGESTED TO HIM AN INTERESTING SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS HIS FIRST SUBJECT WAS EASILY HYPNOTIZED AND OF AN EMOTIONAL NATURE WAGNER'S
2159-179156-0021 WAS PLAYED FROM THE PIANO SCORE THE PULSE OF THE SUBJECT BECAME MORE RAPID AND AT FIRST OF HIGHER TENSION INCREASING FROM A NORMAL RATE OF SIXTY BEATS A MINUTE TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THEN
2159-179156-0022 AS THE MUSIC PROGRESSED THE TENSION DIMINISHED THE RESPIRATION INCREASED FROM EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY PER MINUTE GREAT EXCITEMENT IN THE SUBJECT WAS EVIDENT HIS WHOLE BODY WAS THROWN INTO MOTION HIS LEGS WERE DRAWN UP HIS ARMS TOSSED INTO THE AIR
2159-179156-0023 THE STATE OF MIND BROUGHT UP BEFORE HIM IN THE MOST REALISTIC AND VIVID MANNER POSSIBLE THE PICTURE OF THE RIDE OF TAM O'SHANTER WHICH HE HAD SEEN YEARS BEFORE THE PICTURE
2159-179156-0024 SOON BECAME REAL TO HIM AND HE FOUND HIMSELF TAKING PART IN A WILD CHASE NOT AS WITCH DEVIL OR TAM EVEN BUT IN SOME WAY HIS CONSCIOUSNESS WAS SPREAD THROUGH EVERY PART OF THE SCENE BEING OF IT
2159-179156-0025 AND YET PLAYING THE PART OF SPECTATOR AS IS OFTEN THE CASE IN DREAMS DOCTOR WARTHIN TRIED THE SAME EXPERIMENT AGAIN THIS TIME ON A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS NOT SO EMOTIONAL AND WAS HYPNOTIZED WITH MUCH MORE DIFFICULTY
2159-179156-0026 THIS SUBJECT DID NOT PASS INTO SUCH A DEEP STATE OF HYPNOTISM BUT THE RESULT WAS PRACTICALLY THE SAME THE PULSE RATE ROSE FROM SEVENTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THE SENSATION REMEMBERED WAS THAT OF RIDING FURIOUSLY THROUGH THE AIR
2159-179156-0027 THE EXPERIMENT WAS REPEATED ON OTHER SUBJECTS IN ALL CASES WITH THE SAME RESULT
2159-179156-0028 TO HIM IT ALWAYS EXPRESSED THE PICTURED WILD RIDE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF WOTAN THE SUBJECT TAKING PART IN THE RIDE IT WAS NOTICEABLE IN EACH CASE THAT THE SAME MUSIC PLAYED TO THEM IN THE WAKING STATE PRODUCED NO SPECIAL IMPRESSION
2159-179156-0029 AT FIRST IT SEEMED TO PRODUCE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT FOR THE PULSE WAS LOWERED LATER IT ROSE TO A RATE DOUBLE THE NORMAL AND THE TENSION WAS DIMINISHED THE IMPRESSION DESCRIBED BY THE SUBJECT AFTERWARD
2159-179156-0030 AND THE SUBJECT SEEMED TO CONTEMPLATE A LANDSCAPE OF LOFTY GRANDEUR A DIFFERENT SORT OF MUSIC WAS PLAYED
2159-179156-0031 APPEARS TO SUMMON SIGMUND TO VALHALLA
2159-179156-0032 IT BECAME SLOW AND IRREGULAR AND VERY SMALL THE RESPIRATION DECREASED ALMOST TO GASPING THE FACE GREW PALE AND A COLD PERSPIRATION BROKE OUT READERS WHO ARE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN THIS SUBJECT
2159-179156-0033 WILL FIND DESCRIPTIONS OF MANY OTHER INTERESTING EXPERIMENTS IN THE SAME ARTICLE DOCTOR COCKE DESCRIBES A PECULIAR TRICK HE PLAYED UPON THE SIGHT OF A SUBJECT SAYS HE I ONCE HYPNOTIZED A MAN
2159-179156-0034 AND CALL THE LETTERS AS I DIRECTED STIMULATION WAS IN THIS CASE IMPOSSIBLE AS I MADE HIM READ FIFTEEN OR TWENTY PAGES HE CALLING THE LETTERS AS SUGGESTED EACH TIME THEY OCCURRED THE EXTRAORDINARY HEIGHTENING
2159-179156-0035 AND CLAIRVOYANCE IF THE POWERS OF THE MIND ARE SO ENORMOUSLY INCREASED ALL THAT IS REQUIRED OF A VERY SENSITIVE AND EASILY HYPNOTIZED PERSON IS TO HYPNOTIZE HIM OR HERSELF WHEN HE WILL BE ABLE TO READ THOUGHTS
2159-179157-0000 AND IT IS TRUE THAT A PERSON CAN DELIBERATELY HYPNOTIZE HIMSELF WHEN HE WISHES TO TILL HE HAS BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO IT AND IS EXPERT IN IT SO TO SPEAK IT DOES AWAY AT A STROKE WITH THE CLAIMS OF ALL PROFESSIONAL HYPNOTISTS AND MAGNETIC HEALERS
2159-179157-0001 THAT THEY HAVE ANY PECULIAR POWER IN THEMSELVES WHICH THEY EXERT OVER THEIR FELLOWS ONE OF THESE PROFESSIONALS GIVES AN ACCOUNT IN HIS BOOK OF WHAT HE CALLS THE WONDERFUL LOCK METHOD HE SAYS THAT
2159-179157-0002 THOUGH HE IS LOCKED UP IN A SEPARATE ROOM HE CAN MAKE THE PSYCHIC POWER WORK THROUGH THE WALLS ALL THAT HE DOES IS TO PUT HIS SUBJECTS IN THE WAY OF HYPNOTIZING THEMSELVES
2159-179157-0003 HE SHOWS HIS INCONSISTENCY WHEN HE STATES THAT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THE HYPNOTIZER IS IN DANGER OF BECOMING HYPNOTIZED HIMSELF IN THIS HE MAKES NO CLAIM THAT THE SUBJECT IS USING ANY PSYCHIC POWER
2159-179157-0004 BUT OF COURSE IF THE HYPNOTIZER LOOKS STEADILY INTO THE EYES OF HIS SUBJECT AND THE SUBJECT LOOKS INTO HIS EYES THE STEADY GAZE ON A BRIGHT OBJECT WILL PRODUCE HYPNOTISM IN ONE QUITE AS READILY AS IN THE OTHER
2159-179157-0005 HYPNOTISM IS AN ESTABLISHED SCIENTIFIC FACT BUT THE CLAIM THAT THE HYPNOTIZER HAS ANY MYSTERIOUS PSYCHIC POWER IS THE INVARIABLE MARK OF THE CHARLATAN
2159-179157-0006 PROBABLY NO SCIENTIFIC PHENOMENON WAS EVER SO GROSSLY PROSTITUTED TO BASE ENDS AS THAT OF HYPNOTISM LATER WE SHALL SEE SOME OF THE OUTRAGEOUS FORMS THIS CHARLATANISM ASSUMES
2159-179157-0007 AND HOW IT EXTENDS TO THE PROFESSIONAL SUBJECTS AS WELL AS TO THE PROFESSIONAL OPERATORS TILL THOSE SUBJECTS EVEN IMPOSE UPON SCIENTIFIC MEN WHO OUGHT TO BE PROOF AGAINST SUCH DECEPTION
2159-179157-0008 MOREOVER THE POSSIBILITY OF SELF HYPNOTIZATION CAREFULLY CONCEALED AND CALLED BY ANOTHER NAME OPENS ANOTHER GREAT FIELD OF HUMBUG AND CHARLATANISM OF WHICH THE ADVERTISING COLUMNS OF THE NEWSPAPERS ARE CONSTANTLY FILLED
2159-179157-0009 NAMELY THAT OF THE CLAIRVOYANT AND MEDIUM WE MAY CONCEIVE HOW SUCH A PROFESSION MIGHT BECOME PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE AND HIGHLY USEFUL BUT AT PRESENT IT SEEMS AS IF ANY PERSON WHO WENT INTO IT
2159-179157-0010 HOWEVER HONEST HE MIGHT BE AT THE START SOON BEGAN TO DECEIVE HIMSELF AS WELL AS OTHERS UNTIL HE LOST HIS POWER ENTIRELY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FACT AND IMAGINATION BEFORE DISCUSSING THE MATTER FURTHER
2159-179157-0011 LET US QUOTE DOCTOR COCKE'S EXPERIMENT IN HYPNOTIZING HIMSELF IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT A PROFESSIONAL HYPNOTIZER OR MAGNETIZER HAD HYPNOTIZED HIM BY TELLING HIM TO FIX HIS MIND ON THE NUMBER TWENTY SIX AND HOLDING UP HIS HAND
2159-179157-0012 I WAS INTENSELY COLD MY HEART SEEMED TO STAND STILL I HAD RINGING IN MY EARS MY HAIR SEEMED TO RISE UPON MY SCALP I PERSISTED IN THE EFFORT AND THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED NOISE IN MY EARS GREW LOUDER AND LOUDER
2159-179157-0013 THE ROAR BECAME DEAFENING IT CRACKLED LIKE A MIGHTY FIRE I WAS FEARFULLY CONSCIOUS OF MYSELF HAVING READ VIVID ACCOUNTS OF DREAMS VISIONS ET CETERA IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I WOULD EXPERIENCE THEM
2159-179157-0014 I FELT IN A VAGUE WAY THAT THERE WERE BEINGS ALL ABOUT ME BUT COULD NOT HEAR THEIR VOICES I FELT AS THOUGH EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY WAS FIXED AND RIGID
2159-179157-0015 THE ROAR IN MY EARS GREW LOUDER STILL AND I HEARD ABOVE THE ROAR REPORTS WHICH SOUNDED LIKE ARTILLERY AND MUSKETRY THEN ABOVE THE DIN OF THE NOISE A MUSICAL CHORD I SEEMED TO BE ABSORBED IN THIS CHORD I KNEW NOTHING ELSE
2159-179157-0016 SECONDLY I WISHED TO BE HYPNOTIZED THESE TOGETHER WITH A VIVID IMAGINATION AND STRAINED ATTENTION BROUGHT ON THE STATES WHICH OCCURRED
2159-179157-0017 HIS DESCRIPTIONS OF DREAMS BEAR A WONDERFUL LIKENESS TO DE QUINCEY'S DREAMS SUCH AS THOSE DESCRIBED IN THE ENGLISH MAIL COACH DE PROFUNDIS AND THE CONFESSIONS OF AN ENGLISH OPIUM EATER
2159-179157-0018 ALL OF WHICH WERE PRESUMABLY DUE TO OPIUM THE CAUSES WHICH DOCTOR COCKE THINKS PRODUCED THE HYPNOTIC CONDITION IN HIS CASE NAMELY BELIEF DESIRE TO BE HYPNOTIZED AND STRAINED ATTENTION UNITED WITH A VIVID IMAGINATION
2159-179157-0019 ARE CAUSES WHICH ARE OFTEN FOUND IN CONJUNCTION AND PRODUCE EFFECTS WHICH WE MAY REASONABLY EXPLAIN ON THE THEORY OF SELF HYPNOTIZATION
2159-179157-0020 FOR INSTANCE THE EFFECTS OF AN EXCITING RELIGIOUS REVIVAL ARE VERY LIKE THOSE PRODUCED BY MESMER'S OPERATIONS IN PARIS THE SUBJECTS BECOME HYSTERICAL AND ARE READY TO BELIEVE ANYTHING OR DO ANYTHING
2159-179157-0021 BY PROLONGING THE OPERATION A WHOLE COMMUNITY BECOMES MORE OR LESS HYPNOTIZED IN ALL SUCH CASES HOWEVER UNUSUAL EXCITEMENT IS COMMONLY FOLLOWED BY UNUSUAL LETHARGY
2159-179157-0022 IN FACT IT IS A SORT OF INTOXICATION THE SAME PHENOMENA ARE PROBABLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR MANY OF THE STRANGE RECORDS OF HISTORY THE WONDERFUL CURES AT LOURDES OF WHICH WE HAVE READ IN ZOLA'S NOVEL OF THAT NAME
2159-179157-0023 ARE NO DOUBT THE EFFECT OF HYPNOTIZATION BY THE PRIESTS SOME OF THE STRANGE MOVEMENTS OF WHOLE COMMUNITIES DURING THE CRUSADES ARE TO BE EXPLAINED EITHER ON THE THEORY OF HYPNOTIZATION OR OF CONTAGION
2159-179157-0024 AND POSSIBLY THESE TWO THINGS WILL TURN OUT TO BE MUCH THE SAME IN FACT ON NO OTHER GROUND CAN WE EXPLAIN THE SO CALLED CHILDREN'S CRUSADE IN WHICH OVER THIRTY THOUSAND CHILDREN FROM GERMANY FROM ALL CLASSES OF THE COMMUNITY
2159-179157-0025 TRIED TO CROSS THE ALPS IN WINTER AND IN THEIR STRUGGLES WERE ALL LOST OR SOLD INTO SLAVERY WITHOUT EVEN REACHING THE HOLY LAND AGAIN HYPNOTISM IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR MANY OF THE POET'S DREAMS
2159-179157-0026 GAZING STEADILY AT A BED OF BRIGHT COALS OR A STREAM OF RUNNING WATER WILL INVARIABLY THROW A SENSITIVE SUBJECT INTO A HYPNOTIC SLEEP THAT WILL LAST SOMETIMES FOR SEVERAL HOURS DOCTOR COCKE SAYS
2159-179157-0027 THAT HE HAS EXPERIMENTED IN THIS DIRECTION WITH PATIENTS OF HIS SAYS HE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO RESIST THE STATE OR TO BRING IT AT WILL MANY OF THEM DESCRIBE BEAUTIFUL SCENES FROM NATURE OR SOME MIGHTY CATHEDRAL
2159-179157-0028 WITH ITS LOFTY DOME OR THE FACES OF IMAGINARY BEINGS BEAUTIFUL OR DEMONIACAL ACCORDING TO THE WILL AND TEMPER OF THE SUBJECT PERHAPS THE MOST WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF SELF HYPNOTISM WHICH WE HAVE IN HISTORY
2159-179157-0029 IS THAT OF THE MYSTIC SWEDENBORG WHO SAW SUCH STRANGE THINGS IN HIS VISIONS AND AT LAST CAME TO BELIEVE IN THEM AS REAL THE SAME EXPLANATION MAY BE GIVEN OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF ORIENTAL PROPHETS
2159-179157-0030 FOR IN THE ORIENT HYPNOTISM IS MUCH EASIER AND MORE SYSTEMATICALLY DEVELOPED THAN WITH US OF THE WEST THE PERFORMANCES OF THE DERVISHES AND ALSO OF THE FAKIRS WHO WOUND THEMSELVES AND PERFORM MANY WONDERFUL FEATS
2159-179157-0031 THEIR IMPERSONATIONS ARE RIDICULOUS IN THE EXTREME ONE MAN I REMEMBER BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE SPIRIT OF CHARLES SUMNER BEING UNEDUCATED HE USED THE MOST WRETCHED ENGLISH
2159-179157-0032 AND HIS LANGUAGE WAS UTTERLY DEVOID OF SENSE WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND A VERY INTELLIGENT LADY WHO BELIEVED HERSELF TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE SPIRIT OF CHARLOTTE CUSHMAN PERSONATED THE PART VERY WELL DOCTOR COOKE SAYS OF HIMSELF
2159-179157-0033 I CAN HYPNOTIZE MYSELF TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT I WILL BECOME WHOLLY UNCONSCIOUS OF EVENTS TAKING PLACE AROUND ME AND A LONG INTERVAL OF TIME SAY FROM ONE HALF TO TWO HOURS WILL BE A COMPLETE BLANK
226-122538-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN IN DERYCK'S SAFE CONTROL THE WHITE CLIFFS OF DOVER GRADUALLY BECAME MORE SOLID AND DISTINCT UNTIL AT LENGTH THEY ROSE FROM THE SEA A STRONG WHITE WALL
226-122538-0001 EMBLEM OF THE UNDENIABLE PURITY OF ENGLAND THE STAINLESS HONOUR AND INTEGRITY OF HER THRONE HER CHURCH HER PARLIAMENT HER COURTS OF JUSTICE AND HER DEALINGS AT HOME AND ABROAD WHETHER WITH FRIEND OR FOE
226-122538-0002 STRENGTH AND WHITENESS THOUGHT JANE AS SHE PACED THE STEAMER'S DECK AND AFTER A TWO YEARS ABSENCE HER HEART WENT OUT TO HER NATIVE LAND THEN DOVER CASTLE CAUGHT HER EYE SO BEAUTIFUL IN THE PEARLY LIGHT OF THAT SPRING AFTERNOON
226-122538-0003 AN HOUR AFTER SHE HAD READ IT SHE WAS DRIVING DOWN THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD TO CAIRO EMBARKED AT ALEXANDRIA THE NEXT DAY LANDED AT BRINDISI
226-122538-0004 AND THIS NIGHT AND DAY TRAVELLING HAD BROUGHT HER AT LAST WITHIN SIGHT OF THE SHORES OF ENGLAND IN A FEW MINUTES SHE WOULD SET FOOT UPON THEM AND THEN THERE WOULD BE BUT TWO MORE STAGES TO HER JOURNEY FOR FROM THE MOMENT SHE STARTED
226-122538-0005 JANE NEVER DOUBTED HER ULTIMATE DESTINATION THE ROOM WHERE PAIN AND DARKNESS AND DESPAIR MUST BE WAGING SO TERRIBLE A CONFLICT AGAINST THE MORAL COURAGE THE MENTAL SANITY AND THE INSTINCTIVE HOLD ON LIFE OF THE MAN SHE LOVED
226-122538-0006 THAT SHE WAS GOING TO HIM JANE KNEW BUT SHE FELT UTTERLY UNABLE TO ARRANGE HOW OR IN WHAT WAY HER GOING COULD BE MANAGED THAT IT WAS A COMPLICATED PROBLEM HER COMMON SENSE TOLD HER
226-122538-0007 AND THAT HER SUREST WAY TO GARTH LAY THROUGH THE DOCTOR'S CONSULTING ROOM SO SHE TELEGRAPHED TO DERYCK FROM PARIS AND AT PRESENT HER MIND SAW NO FURTHER THAN WIMPOLE STREET AT DOVER SHE BOUGHT A PAPER
226-122538-0008 AND HASTILY SCANNED ITS PAGES AS SHE WALKED ALONG THE PLATFORM IN THE WAKE OF THE CAPABLE PORTER WHO HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER RUGS AND HAND BAGGAGE IN THE PERSONAL COLUMN SHE FOUND THE VERY PARAGRAPH SHE SOUGHT
226-122538-0009 BUT THE INJURED PARTS WERE PROGRESSING FAVOURABLY AND ALL FEAR OF BRAIN COMPLICATIONS SEEMED OVER DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS HOWEVER A SERIOUS REACTION FROM SHOCK HAS SET IN AND IT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO SUMMON SIR DERYCK BRAND
226-122538-0010 THE WELL KNOWN NERVE SPECIALIST IN CONSULTATION WITH THE OCULIST AND THE LOCAL PRACTITIONER IN CHARGE OF THE CASE THERE IS A FEELING OF WIDE SPREAD REGRET AND SYMPATHY IN THOSE SOCIAL AND ARTISTIC CIRCLES WHERE MISTER DALMAIN WAS SO WELL KNOWN AND SO DESERVEDLY POPULAR
226-122538-0011 THAT JANE'S HALF CROWN WAS NOT A PENNY HE HAD A SICK YOUNG WIFE AT HOME WHO HAD BEEN ORDERED EXTRA NOURISHMENT AND JUST AS THE RUSH ON BOARD BEGAN HE HAD PUT UP A SIMPLE PRAYER TO THE HEAVENLY FATHER
226-122538-0012 WHO KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS ASKING THAT HE MIGHT CATCH THE EYE OF A GENEROUS TRAVELLER HE FELT HE HAD INDEED BEEN LED TO THIS PLAIN BROWN FACED BROAD SHOULDERED LADY WHEN HE REMEMBERED HOW NEARLY
226-122538-0013 AFTER HER CURT NOD FROM A DISTANCE HAD ENGAGED HIM HE HAD RESPONDED TO THE BLANDISHMENTS OF A FUSSY LITTLE WOMAN WITH MANY MORE BAGS AND RUGS AND A PARROT CAGE WHO WAS NOW DOLING FRENCH COPPERS OUT OF THE WINDOW OF THE NEXT COMPARTMENT
226-122538-0014 SEVEN PENCE APENNY OF THIS STUFF AIN'T MUCH FOR CARRYING ALL THAT ALONG I DON'T THINK GRUMBLED HIS MATE AND JANE'S YOUNG PORTER EXPERIENCED THE DOUBLE JOY OF FAITH CONFIRMED AND WILLING SERVICE GENEROUSLY REWARDED A TELEGRAPH BOY WALKED ALONG THE TRAIN SAYING
226-122538-0015 HAVE COFFEE AT DOVER DERYCK JANE GAVE ONE HARD TEARLESS SOB OF THANKFULNESS AND RELIEF SHE HAD BEEN SO LONELY THEN SHE TURNED TO THE WINDOW HERE SOMEBODY FETCH ME A CUP OF COFFEE WILL YOU
226-122538-0016 AND JUST AS THE TRAIN BEGAN TO MOVE HANDED A CUP OF STEAMING COFFEE AND A PLATE OF BREAD AND BUTTER IN AT THE WINDOW OH THANK YOU MY GOOD FELLOW SAID JANE PUTTING THE PLATE ON THE SEAT WHILE SHE DIVED INTO HER POCKET
226-122538-0017 HERE YOU HAVE DONE VERY WELL FOR ME NO NEVER MIND THE CHANGE COFFEE AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE SHOULD FETCH A FANCY PRICE GOOD BYE THE TRAIN MOVED ON AND THE PORTER STOOD LOOKING AFTER IT WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES
226-122538-0018 OVER THE FIRST HALF CROWN HE HAD SAID TO HIMSELF MILK AND NEW LAID EGGS NOW AS HE POCKETED THE SECOND HE ADDED THE OTHER TWO THINGS MENTIONED BY THE PARISH DOCTOR SOUP AND JELLY AND HIS HEART GLOWED
226-122538-0019 YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS AND JANE SEATED IN A COMFORTABLE CORNER CHOKED BACK THE TEARS OF RELIEF WHICH THREATENED TO FALL DRANK HER COFFEE AND WAS THEREBY MORE REVIVED THAN SHE COULD HAVE THOUGHT POSSIBLE
226-122538-0020 SHE READ HIS TELEGRAM THROUGH ONCE MORE AND SMILED HOW LIKE HIM TO THINK OF THE COFFEE AND OH HOW LIKE HIM TO BE COMING TO THE STATION SHE TOOK OFF HER HAT AND LEANED BACK AGAINST THE CUSHIONS
226-122538-0021 SHE HAD BEEN TRAVELLING NIGHT AND DAY IN ONE FEVERISH WHIRL OF HASTE AND AT LAST SHE HAD BROUGHT HERSELF WITHIN REACH OF DERYCK'S HAND AND DERYCK'S SAFE CONTROL THE TURMOIL OF HER SOUL WAS STILLED
226-122538-0022 A GREAT CALM TOOK ITS PLACE AND JANE DROPPED QUIETLY OFF TO SLEEP YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS WASHED AND BRUSHED AND GREATLY REFRESHED
226-122538-0023 JANE STOOD AT THE WINDOW OF HER COMPARTMENT AS THE TRAIN STEAMED INTO CHARING CROSS THE DOCTOR WAS STATIONED EXACTLY OPPOSITE THE DOOR WHEN HER CARRIAGE CAME TO A STANDSTILL
226-122538-0024 MERE CHANCE AND YET TO JANE IT SEEMED SO LIKE HIM TO HAVE TAKEN UP HIS POSITION PRECISELY AT THE RIGHT SPOT ON THAT LONG PLATFORM AN ENTHUSIASTIC LADY PATIENT HAD ONCE SAID OF DERYCK BRAND WITH MORE ACCURACY OF DEFINITION THAN OF GRAMMAR
226-122538-0025 YOU KNOW HE IS ALWAYS SO VERY JUST THERE AND THIS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DOCTOR HAD MADE HIM TO MANY A VERY PRESENT HELP IN TIME OF TROUBLE HE WAS THROUGH THE LINE OF PORTERS AND HAD HIS HAND UPON THE HANDLE OF JANE'S DOOR IN A MOMENT
226-122538-0026 STANDING AT THE WINDOW SHE TOOK ONE LOOK AT THE FIRM LEAN FACE NOW ALIGHT WITH WELCOME AND READ IN THE KIND STEADFAST EYES OF HER CHILDHOOD'S FRIEND A PERFECT SYMPATHY AND COMPREHENSION THEN SHE SAW BEHIND HIM HER AUNT'S FOOTMAN
226-122538-0027 AND HER OWN MAID WHO HAD BEEN GIVEN A PLACE IN THE DUCHESS'S HOUSEHOLD IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE WAS ON THE PLATFORM AND HER HAND WAS IN DERYCK'S THAT IS RIGHT DEAR HE SAID ALL FIT AND WELL I CAN SEE NOW HAND OVER YOUR KEYS
226-122538-0028 I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE NOTHING CONTRABAND I TELEPHONED THE DUCHESS TO SEND SOME OF HER PEOPLE TO MEET YOUR LUGGAGE AND NOT TO EXPECT YOU HERSELF UNTIL DINNER TIME AS YOU WERE TAKING TEA WITH US WAS THAT RIGHT THIS WAY COME OUTSIDE THE BARRIER WHAT A RABBLE
226-122538-0029 ALL WANTING TO BREAK EVERY POSSIBLE RULE AND REGULATION AND EACH TRYING TO BE THE FIRST PERSON IN THE FRONT ROW REALLY THE PATIENCE AND GOOD TEMPER OF RAILWAY OFFICIALS SHOULD TEACH THE REST OF MANKIND A LESSON THE DOCTOR TALKING ALL THE TIME
226-122538-0030 PILOTED JANE THROUGH THE CROWD OPENED THE DOOR OF A NEAT ELECTRIC BROUGHAM HELPED HER IN TOOK HIS SEAT BESIDE HER AND THEY GLIDED SWIFTLY OUT INTO THE STRAND AND TURNED TOWARDS TRAFALGAR SQUARE
226-122538-0031 WELL SAID THE DOCTOR NIAGARA IS A BIG THING ISN'T IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY TO ME WERE YOU NOT DISAPPOINTED IN NIAGARA WE WERE I FEEL TEMPTED TO WISH FOR ONE HOMICIDAL MOMENT THAT THE EARTH WOULD OPEN HER MOUTH AND SWALLOW THEM UP
226-122538-0032 PEOPLE WHO CAN BE DISAPPOINTED IN NIAGARA AND TALK ABOUT IT SHOULD NO LONGER BE ALLOWED TO CRAWL ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND HOW ABOUT THE LITTLE MOTHER ISN'T SHE WORTH KNOWING I HOPE SHE SENT ME HER LOVE AND NEW YORK HARBOUR
226-122538-0033 HE WILL ALWAYS BE BLIND DEAR BUT LIFE HOLDS OTHER THINGS BESIDE SIGHT WE MUST NEVER SAY NO HOPE WILL HE LIVE THERE IS NO REASON HE SHOULD NOT LIVE
226-122538-0034 BUT HOW FAR LIFE WILL BE WORTH LIVING LARGELY DEPENDS UPON WHAT CAN BE DONE FOR HIM POOR CHAP DURING THE NEXT FEW MONTHS HE IS MORE SHATTERED MENTALLY THAN PHYSICALLY
226-131532-0000 WHEN ALL WERE GONE I LEARNT THAT THE VILE SLANDER HAD INDEED BEEN CIRCULATED THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY IN THE VERY PRESENCE OF THE VICTIM ROSE HOWEVER VOWED SHE DID NOT AND WOULD NOT BELIEVE IT
226-131532-0001 AND MY MOTHER MADE THE SAME DECLARATION THOUGH NOT I FEAR WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF REAL UNWAVERING INCREDULITY IT SEEMED TO DWELL CONTINUALLY ON HER MIND AND SHE KEPT IRRITATING ME FROM TIME TO TIME BY SUCH EXPRESSIONS AS
226-131532-0002 THE FOUNDATION IS IN THE WICKEDNESS AND FALSEHOOD OF THE WORLD SAID I AND IN THE FACT THAT MISTER LAWRENCE HAS BEEN SEEN TO GO THAT WAY ONCE OR TWICE OF AN EVENING AND THE VILLAGE GOSSIPS SAY HE GOES TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO THE STRANGE LADY
226-131532-0003 AND THE SCANDAL MONGERS HAVE GREEDILY SEIZED THE RUMOUR TO MAKE IT THE BASIS OF THEIR OWN INFERNAL STRUCTURE WELL BUT GILBERT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN HER MANNER TO COUNTENANCE SUCH REPORTS DID YOU SEE ANYTHING IN HER MANNER
226-131532-0004 NO CERTAINLY BUT THEN YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SAID THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT HER I BELIEVE IT WAS ON THAT VERY EVENING THAT I VENTURED ON ANOTHER INVASION OF WILDFELL HALL FROM THE TIME OF OUR PARTY
226-131532-0005 WHICH WAS UPWARDS OF A WEEK AGO I HAD BEEN MAKING DAILY EFFORTS TO MEET ITS MISTRESS IN HER WALKS AND ALWAYS DISAPPOINTED SHE MUST HAVE MANAGED IT SO ON PURPOSE HAD NIGHTLY KEPT REVOLVING IN MY MIND SOME PRETEXT FOR ANOTHER CALL
226-131532-0006 AT LENGTH I CONCLUDED THAT THE SEPARATION COULD BE ENDURED NO LONGER BY THIS TIME YOU WILL SEE I WAS PRETTY FAR GONE AND TAKING FROM THE BOOK CASE AN OLD VOLUME THAT I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN
226-131532-0007 THOUGH FROM ITS UNSIGHTLY AND SOMEWHAT DILAPIDATED CONDITION I HAD NOT YET VENTURED TO OFFER IT FOR PERUSAL I HASTENED AWAY BUT NOT WITHOUT SUNDRY MISGIVINGS AS TO HOW SHE WOULD RECEIVE ME
226-131532-0008 OR HOW I COULD SUMMON COURAGE TO PRESENT MYSELF WITH SO SLIGHT AN EXCUSE BUT PERHAPS I MIGHT SEE HER IN THE FIELD OR THE GARDEN AND THEN THERE WOULD BE NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IT WAS THE FORMAL KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
226-131532-0009 WITH THE PROSPECT OF BEING GRAVELY USHERED IN BY RACHEL TO THE PRESENCE OF A SURPRISED UNCORDIAL MISTRESS THAT SO GREATLY DISTURBED ME MY WISH HOWEVER WAS NOT GRATIFIED
226-131532-0010 MISSUS GRAHAM HERSELF WAS NOT TO BE SEEN BUT THERE WAS ARTHUR PLAYING WITH HIS FROLICSOME LITTLE DOG IN THE GARDEN I LOOKED OVER THE GATE AND CALLED HIM TO ME HE WANTED ME TO COME IN BUT I TOLD HIM I COULD NOT WITHOUT HIS MOTHER'S LEAVE
226-131532-0011 HE RAN TO PERFORM MY BIDDING AND QUICKLY RETURNED WITH HIS MOTHER HOW LOVELY SHE LOOKED WITH HER DARK RINGLETS STREAMING IN THE LIGHT SUMMER BREEZE HER FAIR CHEEK SLIGHTLY FLUSHED AND HER COUNTENANCE RADIANT WITH SMILES
226-131532-0012 THERE IS NO MEDIATOR LIKE A MERRY SIMPLE HEARTED CHILD EVER READY TO CEMENT DIVIDED HEARTS TO SPAN THE UNFRIENDLY GULF OF CUSTOM TO MELT THE ICE OF COLD RESERVE AND OVERTHROW THE SEPARATING WALLS OF DREAD FORMALITY AND PRIDE
226-131532-0013 WELL MISTER MARKHAM WHAT IS IT SAID THE YOUNG MOTHER ACCOSTING ME WITH A PLEASANT SMILE I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THIS BOOK AND IF YOU PLEASE TO TAKE IT AND PERUSE IT AT YOUR LEISURE
226-131532-0014 I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR CALLING YOU OUT ON SUCH A LOVELY EVENING THOUGH IT BE FOR A MATTER OF NO GREATER IMPORTANCE TELL HIM TO COME IN MAMMA SAID ARTHUR WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME IN ASKED THE LADY YES
226-131532-0015 I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOUR IMPROVEMENTS IN THE GARDEN AND HOW YOUR SISTER'S ROOTS HAVE PROSPERED IN MY CHARGE ADDED SHE AS SHE OPENED THE GATE AND WE SAUNTERED THROUGH THE GARDEN AND TALKED OF THE FLOWERS THE TREES AND THE BOOK
226-131532-0016 AND THEN OF OTHER THINGS THE EVENING WAS KIND AND GENIAL AND SO WAS MY COMPANION BY DEGREES I WAXED MORE WARM AND TENDER THAN PERHAPS I HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE
226-131532-0017 BUT STILL I SAID NOTHING TANGIBLE AND SHE ATTEMPTED NO REPULSE UNTIL IN PASSING A MOSS ROSE TREE THAT I HAD BROUGHT HER SOME WEEKS SINCE IN MY SISTER'S NAME
226-131532-0018 AND I SAW A FLASH OF ECSTATIC BRILLIANCE IN HER EYE A GLOW OF GLAD EXCITEMENT ON HER FACE I THOUGHT MY HOUR OF VICTORY WAS COME BUT INSTANTLY A PAINFUL RECOLLECTION SEEMED TO FLASH UPON HER
226-131532-0019 A CLOUD OF ANGUISH DARKENED HER BROW A MARBLE PALENESS BLANCHED HER CHEEK AND LIP THERE SEEMED A MOMENT OF INWARD CONFLICT AND WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT SHE WITHDREW HER HAND AND RETREATED A STEP OR TWO BACK
226-131532-0020 NOW MISTER MARKHAM SAID SHE WITH A KIND OF DESPERATE CALMNESS I MUST TELL YOU PLAINLY THAT I CANNOT DO WITH THIS I LIKE YOUR COMPANY BECAUSE I AM ALONE HERE
226-131532-0021 AND LET ME ALONE HEREAFTER IN FACT WE MUST BE STRANGERS FOR THE FUTURE I WILL THEN BE YOUR FRIEND OR BROTHER OR ANYTHING YOU WISH IF YOU WILL ONLY LET ME CONTINUE TO SEE YOU BUT TELL ME WHY I CANNOT BE ANYTHING MORE
226-131532-0022 THERE WAS A PERPLEXED AND THOUGHTFUL PAUSE IS IT IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME RASH VOW IT IS SOMETHING OF THE KIND SHE ANSWERED SOME DAY I MAY TELL YOU BUT AT PRESENT YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE ME
226-131532-0023 AND NEVER GILBERT PUT ME TO THE PAINFUL NECESSITY OF REPEATING WHAT I HAVE JUST NOW SAID TO YOU SHE EARNESTLY ADDED GIVING ME HER HAND IN SERIOUS KINDNESS HOW SWEET HOW MUSICAL MY OWN NAME SOUNDED IN HER MOUTH
226-131532-0024 I WILL NOT I REPLIED BUT YOU PARDON THIS OFFENCE ON CONDITION THAT YOU NEVER REPEAT IT AND MAY I COME TO SEE YOU NOW AND THEN PERHAPS OCCASIONALLY
226-131532-0025 PROVIDED YOU NEVER ABUSE THE PRIVILEGE I MAKE NO EMPTY PROMISES BUT YOU SHALL SEE THE MOMENT YOU DO OUR INTIMACY IS AT AN END THAT'S ALL AND WILL YOU ALWAYS CALL ME GILBERT
226-131532-0026 BUT AS I WENT THE TRAMP OF HORSES HOOFS FELL ON MY EAR AND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF THE DEWY EVENING AND LOOKING TOWARDS THE LANE I SAW A SOLITARY EQUESTRIAN COMING UP INCLINING TO DUSK AS IT WAS
226-131532-0027 AND SEEMED INCLINED TO TURN BACK BUT ON SECOND THOUGHT APPARENTLY JUDGED IT BETTER TO CONTINUE HIS COURSE AS BEFORE HE ACCOSTED ME WITH A SLIGHT BOW AND EDGING CLOSE TO THE WALL ENDEAVOURED TO PASS ON BUT I WAS NOT SO MINDED
226-131532-0028 YOU AND YOUR PONY BE WHAT MAKES YOU SO COARSE AND BRUTAL MARKHAM I'M QUITE ASHAMED OF YOU YOU ANSWER MY QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU LEAVE THIS SPOT I WILL KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY THIS PERFIDIOUS DUPLICITY
226-131532-0029 IF YOU STAND TILL MORNING NOW THEN SAID I UNCLOSING MY HAND BUT STILL STANDING BEFORE HIM ASK ME SOME OTHER TIME WHEN YOU CAN SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN RETURNED HE AND HE MADE AN EFFORT TO PASS ME AGAIN
226-131532-0030 BUT I QUICKLY RE CAPTURED THE PONY SCARCE LESS ASTONISHED THAN ITS MASTER AT SUCH UNCIVIL USAGE REALLY MISTER MARKHAM THIS IS TOO MUCH SAID THE LATTER CAN I NOT GO TO SEE MY TENANT ON MATTERS OF BUSINESS WITHOUT BEING ASSAULTED IN THIS MANNER BY
226-131532-0031 AND IN TRUTH THE VICAR WAS JUST BEHIND ME PLODDING HOMEWARD FROM SOME REMOTE CORNER OF HIS PARISH I IMMEDIATELY RELEASED THE SQUIRE AND HE WENT ON HIS WAY SALUTING MISTER MILLWARD AS HE PASSED
226-131532-0032 WHAT QUARRELLING MARKHAM CRIED THE LATTER ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO ME
226-131532-0033 BUT LET ME TELL YOU YOUNG MAN HERE HE PUT HIS FACE INTO MINE WITH AN IMPORTANT CONFIDENTIAL AIR SHE'S NOT WORTH IT AND HE CONFIRMED THE ASSERTION BY A SOLEMN NOD
226-131532-0034 WITH A LOOK THAT PLAINLY SAID WHAT THIS TO ME
226-131533-0000 YOU MUST SUPPOSE ABOUT THREE WEEKS PASSED OVER MISSUS GRAHAM AND I WERE NOW ESTABLISHED FRIENDS OR BROTHER AND SISTER AS WE RATHER CHOSE TO CONSIDER OURSELVES
226-131533-0001 SHE CALLED ME GILBERT BY MY EXPRESS DESIRE AND I CALLED HER HELEN FOR I HAD SEEN THAT NAME WRITTEN IN HER BOOKS I SELDOM ATTEMPTED TO SEE HER ABOVE TWICE A WEEK
226-131533-0002 AND STILL I MADE OUR MEETINGS APPEAR THE RESULT OF ACCIDENT AS OFTEN AS I COULD FOR I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL AND ALTOGETHER I BEHAVED WITH SUCH EXCEEDING PROPRIETY THAT SHE NEVER HAD OCCASION TO REPROVE ME ONCE
226-131533-0003 YET I COULD NOT BUT PERCEIVE THAT SHE WAS AT TIMES UNHAPPY AND DISSATISFIED WITH HERSELF OR HER POSITION AND TRULY I MYSELF WAS NOT QUITE CONTENTED WITH THE LATTER THIS ASSUMPTION OF BROTHERLY NONCHALANCE WAS VERY HARD TO SUSTAIN
226-131533-0004 AND I OFTEN FELT MYSELF A MOST CONFOUNDED HYPOCRITE WITH IT ALL I SAW TOO OR RATHER I FELT THAT IN SPITE OF HERSELF I WAS NOT INDIFFERENT TO HER AS THE NOVEL HEROES MODESTLY EXPRESS IT
226-131533-0005 AND WHILE I THANKFULLY ENJOYED MY PRESENT GOOD FORTUNE I COULD NOT FAIL TO WISH AND HOPE FOR SOMETHING BETTER IN FUTURE BUT OF COURSE I KEPT SUCH DREAMS ENTIRELY TO MYSELF
226-131533-0006 YOU'RE GOING TO WILDFELL HALL AREN'T YOU WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SO BECAUSE YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE BUT I WISH YOU WOULDN'T GO SO OFTEN NONSENSE CHILD I DON'T GO ONCE IN SIX WEEKS WHAT DO YOU MEAN
226-131533-0007 WELL BUT IF I WERE YOU I WOULDN'T HAVE SO MUCH TO DO WITH MISSUS GRAHAM WHY ROSE ARE YOU TOO GIVING IN TO THE PREVAILING OPINION NO RETURNED SHE HESITATINGLY
226-131533-0008 BOTH AT THE WILSONS AND THE VICARAGE AND BESIDES MAMMA SAYS IF SHE WERE A PROPER PERSON SHE WOULD NOT BE LIVING THERE BY HERSELF AND DON'T YOU REMEMBER LAST WINTER GILBERT ALL THAT ABOUT THE FALSE NAME TO THE PICTURE
226-131533-0009 AND HOW SHE EXPLAINED IT SAYING SHE HAD FRIENDS OR ACQUAINTANCES FROM WHOM SHE WISHED HER PRESENT RESIDENCE TO BE CONCEALED AND THAT SHE WAS AFRAID OF THEIR TRACING HER OUT AND THEN HOW SUDDENLY SHE STARTED UP AND LEFT THE ROOM WHEN THAT PERSON CAME
226-131533-0010 WHOM SHE TOOK GOOD CARE NOT TO LET US CATCH A GLIMPSE OF AND WHO ARTHUR WITH SUCH AN AIR OF MYSTERY TOLD US WAS HIS MAMMA'S FRIEND YES ROSE I REMEMBER IT ALL AND I CAN FORGIVE YOUR UNCHARITABLE CONCLUSIONS
226-131533-0011 FOR PERHAPS IF I DID NOT KNOW HER MYSELF I SHOULD PUT ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER AND BELIEVE THE SAME AS YOU DO BUT THANK GOD I DO KNOW HER AND I SHOULD BE UNWORTHY THE NAME OF A MAN IF I COULD BELIEVE ANYTHING THAT WAS SAID AGAINST HER
226-131533-0012 UNLESS I HEARD IT FROM HER OWN LIPS I SHOULD AS SOON BELIEVE SUCH THINGS OF YOU ROSE OH GILBERT WELL
226-131533-0013 YOU KNOW NOTHING OF HER FORMER LIFE AND LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT SUCH A PERSON EXISTED NO MATTER THERE IS SUCH A THING AS LOOKING THROUGH A PERSON'S EYES INTO THE HEART AND LEARNING MORE OF THE HEIGHT AND BREADTH
226-131533-0014 AND DEPTH OF ANOTHER'S SOUL IN ONE HOUR THAN IT MIGHT TAKE YOU A LIFETIME TO DISCOVER IF HE OR SHE WERE NOT DISPOSED TO REVEAL IT OR IF YOU HAD NOT THE SENSE TO UNDERSTAND IT THEN YOU ARE GOING TO SEE HER THIS EVENING
