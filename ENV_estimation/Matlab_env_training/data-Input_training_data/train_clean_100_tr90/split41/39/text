7511-102419-0055 AND ARE ALL WILLING TO HELP I DON'T THINK I SHALL BE ABLE TO TELL YOU OF ANY GREAT EXPLOITS I MAKE WITH THE GUN I FIRED ONE THAT MISTER STEWART CARRIES AND IT ALMOST KICKED MY SHOULDER OFF I AM MYSTIFIED ABOUT MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY'S LICENSE
7511-102419-0056 I KNOW SHE WOULD NOT SHOOT ONE OF THOSE BIG GUNS FOR A DOZEN ELK BESIDES THAT SHE IS VERY TENDER HEARTED AND WILL NEVER HARM ANYTHING HERSELF ALTHOUGH SHE LIKES TO JOIN OUR HUNTS I THINK YOU MUST BE TIRED OF THIS LETTER SO I AM GOING TO SAY GOOD NIGHT MY FRIEND
7511-102420-0000 CAMP CLOUDCREST OCTOBER SIXTH NINETEEN FOURTEEN DEAR MISSUS CONEY IT SEEMS SO ODD TO BE WRITING YOU AND GETTING NO ANSWERS
7511-102420-0001 I HAVEN'T ONE THING I TOLD HER I OWED YOU MORE LOVE THAN I COULD EVER PAY IN A LIFETIME AND SHE SAID WRITING SUCH LONG LETTERS IS A MIGHTY POOR WAY TO SHOW IT I HAVE BEEN NEGLECTING YOU SHAMEFULLY I THINK
7511-102420-0002 ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I CAME ON THIS HUNT WAS TO TAKE THE TRIP FOR YOU AND TO TELL YOU THINGS THAT YOU WOULD MOST ENJOY SO I WILL SPEND THIS SNOWY DAY IN WRITING TO YOU ON THE NIGHT OF SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH THERE WAS THE MOST AWFUL THUNDERSTORM I EVER WITNESSED
7511-102420-0003 FLASH AFTER FLASH OF THE MOST BLINDING LIGHTNING FOLLOWED BY DEAFENING PEALS OF THUNDER AND AS IT ECHOED FROM MOUNTAIN TO MOUNTAIN THE UPROAR WAS TERRIFYING I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED A STORM THE BEAT OF HAIL AND RAIN AND THE ROAR OF WIND
7511-102420-0004 ALWAYS APPEAL TO ME BUT THERE WAS NEITHER WIND NOR RAIN JUST FLASH AND ROAR BEFORE THE ECHO DIED AWAY AMONG THE HILLS ANOTHER BOOMING REPORT WOULD SEEM TO SHIVER THE ATMOSPHERE AND SET ALL OUR TINWARE JANGLING
7511-102420-0005 WE ARE CAMPED SO NEAR THE GREAT PINES THAT I WILL CONFESS I WAS POWERFULLY AFRAID HAD THE LIGHTNING STRUCK ONE OF THE BIG PINES THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ONE OF US LEFT I COULD HEAR MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY MURMURING HER PRAYERS WHEN THERE WAS A LULL
7511-102420-0006 WE HAD GONE TO BED BUT I COULDN'T REMAIN THERE SO I SAT ON THE WAGON SEAT WITH JERRINE BESIDE ME SOMETHING STRUCK THE GUY ROPES OF THE TENT AND I WAS SO FRIGHTENED I WAS TOO WEAK TO CRY OUT I THOUGHT THE BIG TREE MUST HAVE FALLEN
7511-102420-0007 IN THE LULLS OF THE STORM I COULD HEAR THE MEN'S VOICES HIGH AND EXCITED THEY TOO WERE UP IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE STORM LASTED FOR HOURS BUT AT LAST IT MOVED OFF UP THE VALLEY THE FLASHES GREW TO BE A MERE GLIMMER
7511-102420-0008 AND THE THUNDER MERE RUMBLING THE PINES BEGAN TO MOAN AND SOON A LITTLE BREEZE WHISTLED BY SO WE LAY DOWN AGAIN NEXT MORNING THE HORSES COULD NOT BE FOUND THE STORM HAD FRIGHTENED THEM AND THEY HAD TRIED TO GO HOME
7511-102420-0009 THE MEN HAD TO FIND THEM AND AS IT TOOK MOST OF THE DAY WE HAD TO PUT OFF OUR HUNT WE WERE UP AND ABOUT NEXT MORNING IN THE FIRST FAINT GRAY LIGHT WHILE THE MEN FED GRAIN TO THE HORSES AND SADDLED THEM WE PREPARED A HASTY BREAKFAST
7511-102420-0010 WE WERE OFF BEFORE IT WAS MORE THAN LIGHT ENOUGH FOR US TO SEE THE TRAIL DAWN IN THE MOUNTAINS HOW I WISH I COULD DESCRIBE IT TO YOU IF I COULD ONLY MAKE YOU FEEL THE KEEN BRACING AIR THE EXHILARATING CLIMB
7511-102420-0011 GREENISH AMBER LIGHT AND A BLUE GRAY SKY FAR AHEAD OF US WE COULD SEE THE RED RIM ROCK OF A MOUNTAIN ABOVE TIMBER LINE THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN TURNED THE JAGGED PEAKS INTO GOLDEN POINTS OF A CROWN IN OKLAHOMA
7511-102420-0012 EVEN AT THIS SEASON BUT HERE THERE ARE NO SONG BIRDS AND ONLY THE SNAPPING OF TWIGS AS OUR HORSES CLIMBED THE FROSTY TRAIL BROKE THE SILENCE WE HAD BEEN CAUTIONED NOT TO TALK BUT NEITHER MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY NOR I WANTED TO
7511-102420-0013 THE SUN WAS WELL UP WHEN WE REACHED THE LITTLE PARK WHERE WE PICKETED OUR HORSES THEN CAME A LONG HARD CLIMB IT IS HARD CLIMBING AT THE BEST AND WHEN THERE IS A BIG GUN TO CARRY IT IS VERY HARD
7511-102420-0014 THEN TOO WE HAD TO KEEP UP WITH THE MEN AND WE DIDN'T FIND THAT EASY TO DO AT LAST WE REACHED THE TOP AND SAT DOWN ON SOME BOULDERS TO REST A FEW MINUTES BEFORE WE STARTED DOWN TO THE HUNTING GROUND WHICH LAY IN A CUPLIKE VALLEY FAR BELOW US
7511-102420-0015 WE COULD HEAR THE ROAR OF THE GROS VENTRE AS IT TUMBLED GRUMBLINGLY OVER ITS ROCKY BED TO OUR RIGHT ROSE MILE AFTER MILE OF RED CLIFFS AS THE LAST OF THE QUAKING ASP LEAVES HAVE FALLEN THERE WERE NO GOLDEN GROVES
7511-102420-0016 IN THEIR PLACES STOOD SILVERY PATCHES AGAINST THE RED BACKGROUND OF THE CLIFFS HIGH OVERHEAD A TRIANGLE OF WILD GEESE HARROWED THE BLUE SKY I WAS PLUMB OUT OF BREATH BUT MEN WHO ARE MOST GALLANT ELSEWHERE ARE
7511-102420-0017 ABSOLUTELY HEARTLESS ON A HUNT I WAS SCARCELY THROUGH PANTING BEFORE WE BEGAN TO DESCEND WE RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS AS TO HOW WE SHOULD MOVE SO AS TO KEEP OUT OF RANGE OF EACH OTHER'S GUNS THEN MISTER HAYNES AND MYSELF STARTED ONE WAY
7511-102420-0018 AND MISTER STRUBLE AND MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY THE OTHER WE WERE TO MEET WHERE THE VALLEY TERMINATED IN A BROAD PASS WE FELT SURE WE COULD GET A CHANCE AT WHAT ELK THERE MIGHT BE IN THE VALLEY WE WERE FOLLOWING FRESH TRACKS AND A LITTLE OF THE HUNTER'S ENTHUSIASM SEIZED ME
7511-102420-0019 WE HAD NOT FOLLOWED THEM FAR WHEN THREE COWS AND A SPIKE CAME RUNNING OUT OF THE PINES A LITTLE AHEAD OF US INSTANTLY MISTER HAYNES'S GUN FLEW TO HIS SHOULDER AND A DEAFENING REPORT JARRED OUR EARS HE RAN FORWARD
7511-102420-0020 BUT I STOOD STILL FASCINATED BY WHAT I SAW OUR SIDE OF THE VALLEY WAS BOUNDED BY A RIM OF ROCK OVER THE RIM WAS A SHEER WALL OF ROCK FOR TWO HUNDRED FEET TO WHERE THE GROS VENTRE WAS ANGRILY ROARING BELOW ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREAM
7511-102420-0021 ROSE THE RED CLIFFS WITH THEIR JAGGED CRAGS AT THE REPORT OF THE GUN TWO HUGE BLOCKS OF STONE ALMOST AS LARGE AS A HOUSE DETACHED THEMSELVES AND FELL AT THE SAME INSTANT ONE OF THE QUAKING ASP GROVES
7511-102420-0022 BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES I SHUT THEM A MOMENT BUT WHEN I LOOKED THE GROVE WAS MOVING FASTER IT SLID SWIFTLY AND I COULD PLAINLY HEAR THE RATTLE OF STONES FALLING AGAINST STONES UNTIL WITH A MUFFLED ROAR
7511-102420-0023 THE WHOLE HILLSIDE FELL INTO THE STREAM MISTER HAYNES CAME RUNNING BACK WHAT IS THE MATTER ARE YOU HURT WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOOT HE ASKED I WAVED MY HAND WEAKLY TOWARD WHERE THE GREAT MOUND OF TANGLED TREES AND EARTH BLOCKED THE WATER
7511-102420-0024 NOT AN EARTHQUAKE YOU ARE AS WHITE AS A GHOST COME ON UP HERE AND SEE MY FINE ELK I SAT ON A LOG WATCHING HIM DRESS HIS ELK WE HAVE FOUND IT BEST NOT TO REMOVE THE SKIN
7511-102420-0025 BUT THE ELK HAVE TO BE QUARTERED SO AS TO LOAD THEM ON TO A HORSE MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY AND MISTER STRUBLE CAME OUT OF THE WOODS JUST THEN THEY HAD SEEN A BIG BUNCH OF ELK HEADED BY A SPLENDID BULL BUT GOT NO SHOT AND THE ELK WENT OUT OF THE PASS
7511-102420-0026 THEY HAD HEARD OUR SHOT AND CAME ACROSS TO SEE WHAT LUCK WHAT IVER IS THE MATTER WITH YE ASKED MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY MISTER HAYNES TOLD HER THEY HAD HEARD THE NOISE BUT HAD THOUGHT IT THUNDER MISTER HAYNES TOLD ME THAT IF I WOULD CHIRK UP
7511-102420-0027 HE WOULD GIVE ME HIS ELK TEETH THOUGH I DON'T ADMIRE THEM THEY ARE CONSIDERED VALUABLE HOWEVER HIS ELK WAS A COW AND THEY DON'T HAVE AS NICE TEETH AS DO BULLS WE HAD LUNCH AND THE MEN COVERED THE ELK WITH PINE BOUGHS
7511-102420-0028 TO KEEP THE CAMP ROBBERS FROM PECKING IT FULL OF HOLES NEXT DAY THE MEN WOULD COME WITH THE HORSES AND PACK IT IN TO CAMP WE ALL FELT REFRESHED SO WE STARTED ON THE TRAIL OF THOSE THAT GOT AWAY
7511-102420-0029 FOR A WHILE WALKING WAS EASY AND WE MADE PRETTY GOOD TIME THEN WE HAD A ROCKY HILL TO GET OVER WE HAD TO USE CARE WHEN WE GOT INTO THE TIMBER THERE WERE MARSHY PLACES WHICH TRIED US SORELY
7511-102420-0030 AND WINDFALL SO THICK THAT WE COULD HARDLY GET THROUGH WE WERE OBLIGED TO PICK OUR WAY CAREFULLY TO AVOID NOISE AND WE WERE ALL TOGETHER NOT HAVING COME TO A PLACE WHERE IT SEEMED BETTER TO SEPARATE
7511-102420-0031 WE HAD ABOUT RESOLVED TO GO TO OUR HORSES WHEN WE HEARD A VOLLEY OF SHOTS THAT IS SOMEBODY BUNCH SHOOTING SAID MISTER STRUBLE THEY ARE IN BREWSTER LAKE PARK BY THE SOUND THAT MEANS THAT THE ELK WILL PASS HERE IN A SHORT TIME AND WE MAY GET A SHOT
7511-102420-0032 THE ELK WILL BE HERE LONG BEFORE THE MEN SINCE THE MEN HAVE NO HORSES SO LET'S HURRY AND GET PLACED ALONG THE ONLY PLACE THEY CAN GET OUT WE'LL GET OUR LIMIT WE HASTILY SECRETED OURSELVES ALONG THE NARROW GORGE THROUGH WHICH THE ELK MUST PASS
7511-102420-0033 WE WERE ALL ON ONE SIDE AND MISTER HAYNES SAID TO ME REST YOUR GUN ON THAT ROCK AND AIM AT THE FIRST RIB BACK OF THE SHOULDER IF YOU SHOOT HAPHAZARD YOU MAY CRIPPLE AN ELK AND LET IT GET AWAY TO DIE IN MISERY SO MAKE SURE WHEN YOU FIRE
7511-102420-0034 IT DIDN'T SEEM A MINUTE BEFORE WE HEARD THE BEAT OF THEIR HOOFS AND A QUEER PANTING NOISE THAT I CAN'T DESCRIBE FIRST CAME A BEAUTIFUL THING WITH HIS HEAD HELD HIGH
7511-102420-0035 HIS EYES WERE STARTLED AND HIS SHINING BLACK MANE SEEMED TO BRISTLE I HEARD THE REPORT OF GUNS AND HE TUMBLED IN A CONFUSED HEAP HE TRIED TO RISE BUT OTHERS COMING LEAPED OVER HIM AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN SOME MORE SHOTS
7511-102420-0036 AND THOSE BEHIND TURNED AND WENT BACK THE WAY THEY HAD COME MISTER HAYNES SHOUTED TO ME SHOOT SHOOT WHY DON'T YOU SHOOT SO I FIRED MY KRAG BUT NEXT I FOUND MYSELF PICKING MYSELF UP
7511-102420-0037 AND WONDERING WHO HAD STRUCK ME AND FOR WHAT I WAS SO DIZZY I COULD SCARCELY MOVE BUT I GOT DOWN TO WHERE THE OTHERS WERE EXCITEDLY ADMIRING THE TWO DEAD ELK THAT THEY SAID WERE THE VICTIMS OF MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY'S GUN
7511-102420-0038 SHE WAS AS EXCITED AND DELIGHTED AS IF SHE HAD NEVER DECLARED SHE WOULD NOT KILL ANYTHING SURE IT'S MANY A MEAL THEY'LL MAKE FOR LITTLE HUNGRY MOUTHS SHE SAID SHE WAS RUBBING HER SHOULDER RUEFULLY
7511-102420-0039 I THOUGHT OLD GOLIAR HAD HIT ME A BIFF WITH A BLACKTHORN SHILALEY SHE REMARKED MISTER HAYNES TURNED TO ME AND SAID YOU ARE A DANDY HUNTER YOU DIDN'T SHOOT AT ALL UNTIL AFTER THE ELK WERE GONE
7511-102420-0040 AND THE WAY YOU HELD YOUR GUN IT IS A WONDER IT DIDN'T KNOCK YOUR HEAD OFF INSTEAD OF JUST SMASHING YOUR JAW THE MEN WORKED AS FAST AS THEY COULD AT THE ELK AND WE HELPED AS MUCH AS WE COULD BUT IT WAS DARK BEFORE WE REACHED CAMP
7511-102420-0041 SUPPER WAS READY BUT I WENT TO BED AT ONCE THEY ALL THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED BUT IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS SO STIFF AND SORE I COULD HARDLY MOVE AND SO TIRED I COULDN'T SLEEP NEXT MORNING MY JAW AND NECK WERE SO SWOLLEN
7511-102420-0042 THAT I HATED ANY ONE TO SEE ME AND MY HEAD ACHED FOR TWO DAYS IT HAS BEEN SNOWING FOR A LONG TIME BUT CLYDE SAYS HE WILL TAKE ME HUNTING WHEN IT STOPS
7511-102420-0043 AND GO BACK EMPTY HANDED AND PARTLY TO GET A REST FROM MISTER MURRY'S EVERLASTING ACCORDION MISTER MURRY IS AN OLD TIME ACQUAINTANCE OF MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY'S HE HAS A RANCH DOWN ON THE RIVER SOMEWHERE MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY HAS NOT SEEN HIM FOR YEARS
7511-102420-0044 DIDN'T KNOW HE LIVED UP HERE HE HAD SEEN THE GAME WARDEN FROM WHOM SHE HAD PROCURED HER LICENSE AND SO HUNTED UP OUR CAMP HE IS AN ODD LOOKING INDIVIDUAL WITH SAD EYES AND A DROOPING MOUTH WHICH GIVES HIS FACE A MOST HOPELESS REPROACHFUL EXPRESSION
7511-102420-0045 HIS NOSE HOWEVER SEEMS TO UPSET THE ORIGINAL PLAN FOR IT IS LONG AND THIN AND BENT SLIGHTLY TO ONE SIDE HIS NECK IS LONG AND HIS ADAM'S APPLE SEEMS UNCERTAIN AS TO WHERE IT BELONGS AT SUPPER JERRINE WATCHED IT
7511-102420-0046 AS IF FASCINATED UNTIL I SENT HER FROM THE TABLE AND WENT OUT TO SPEAK TO HER ABOUT GAZING WHY MAMMA SHE SAID I HAD TO LOOK HE HAS SWALLOWED SOMETHING THAT WON'T GO EITHER UP OR DOWN AND I'M FRAID HE'LL CHOKE
7511-102420-0047 ALTHOUGH I CAN'T BRAG ABOUT MISTER MURRY'S APPEARANCE I CAN ABOUT HIS TASTE FOR HE ADMIRES MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY IT SEEMS THAT IN YEARS GONE BY HE HAS MADE ATTEMPTS TO MARRY HER AS HE GOT UP FROM SUPPER THE FIRST NIGHT HE WAS WITH US HE SAID
7511-102420-0048 MARY ELLEN I HAVE A REAL TREAT AND SURPRISE FOR YOU JUST WAIT A FEW MINUTES AN I'LL BET YOU'LL BE HAPPY WE TOOK OUR ACCUSTOMED PLACES AROUND THE FIRE WHILE MISTER MURRY HOBBLED HIS CAYUSE AND TOOK AN ODD LOOKING BUNDLE FROM HIS SADDLE
7511-102420-0049 HE SEATED HIMSELF AND TOOK FROM THE BUNDLE AN ACCORDION HE SET IT UPON HIS KNEE AND BEGAN PULLING AND PUSHING ON IT HE DID WHAT MISTER STRUBLE SAID WAS DOLING A DOLEFUL TUNE EVERY ONE TOOK IT GOOD NATUREDLY
7511-102420-0050 BUT WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO RUN NIGGER RUN AND THE OLD GRAY HOSS COME A TEARIN OUT THE WILDERNESS I'LL SING THEM TO YOU WHEN I COME TO DENVER
7635-105409-0000 MARGUERITE'S ACHING HEART STOOD STILL SHE FELT MORE THAN SHE HEARD THE MEN ON THE WATCH PREPARING FOR THE FIGHT HER SENSES TOLD HER THAT EACH WITH SWORD IN HAND WAS CROUCHING READY FOR THE SPRING
7635-105409-0001 THE VOICE CAME NEARER AND NEARER IN THE VAST IMMENSITY OF THESE LONELY CLIFFS WITH THE LOUD MURMUR OF THE SEA BELOW IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY HOW NEAR OR HOW FAR NOR YET FROM WHICH DIRECTION CAME THAT CHEERFUL SINGER WHO SANG TO GOD TO SAVE HIS KING WHILST HE HIMSELF WAS IN SUCH DEADLY DANGER
7635-105409-0002 FELT THAT HER VERY LIFE WAS SLIPPING AWAY AS IF WHEN THAT VOICE DREW NEARER WHEN THAT SINGER BECAME ENTRAPPED SHE DISTINCTLY HEARD THE CLICK OF DESGAS GUN CLOSE TO HER NO NO NO NO OH GOD IN HEAVEN THIS CANNOT BE
7635-105409-0003 LET ARMAND'S BLOOD THEN BE ON HER OWN HEAD LET HER BE BRANDED AS HIS MURDERER LET EVEN HE WHOM SHE LOVED DESPISE AND LOATHE HER FOR THIS BUT GOD OH GOD SAVE HIM AT ANY COST WITH A WILD SHRIEK SHE SPRANG TO HER FEET AND DARTED ROUND THE ROCK
7635-105409-0004 ARMAND ARMAND FOR GOD'S SAKE FIRE YOUR LEADER IS NEAR HE IS COMING HE IS BETRAYED ARMAND ARMAND FIRE IN HEAVEN'S NAME SHE WAS SEIZED AND THROWN TO THE GROUND SHE LAY THERE MOANING BRUISED NOT CARING BUT STILL HALF SOBBING HALF SHRIEKING
7635-105409-0005 PERCY MY HUSBAND FOR GOD'S SAKE FLY ARMAND ARMAND WHY DON'T YOU FIRE
7635-105409-0006 SOMETHING WAS THROWN OVER HER FACE SHE COULD NOT BREATHE AND PERFORCE SHE WAS SILENT THE BOLD SINGER TOO HAD BECOME SILENT WARNED NO DOUBT OF HIS IMPENDING DANGER BY MARGUERITE'S FRANTIC SHRIEKS THE MEN HAD SPRUNG TO THEIR FEET THERE WAS NO NEED FOR FURTHER SILENCE ON THEIR PART
7635-105409-0007 THE VERY CLIFFS ECHOED THE POOR HEART BROKEN WOMAN'S SCREAMS CHAUVELIN WITH A MUTTERED OATH WHICH BODED NO GOOD TO HER WHO HAD DARED TO UPSET HIS MOST CHERISHED PLANS HAD HASTILY SHOUTED THE WORD OF COMMAND INTO IT MY MEN AND LET NO ONE ESCAPE FROM THAT HUT ALIVE
7635-105409-0008 THE MOON HAD ONCE MORE EMERGED FROM BETWEEN THE CLOUDS THE DARKNESS ON THE CLIFFS HAD GONE GIVING PLACE ONCE MORE TO BRILLIANT SILVERY LIGHT SOME OF THE SOLDIERS HAD RUSHED TO THE ROUGH WOODEN DOOR OF THE HUT WHILST ONE OF THEM KEPT GUARD OVER MARGUERITE
7635-105409-0009 THE DOOR WAS PARTIALLY OPEN ONE OF THE SOLDIERS PUSHED IT FURTHER BUT WITHIN ALL WAS DARKNESS THE CHARCOAL FIRE ONLY LIGHTING WITH A DIM RED LIGHT THE FURTHEST CORNER OF THE HUT THE SOLDIERS PAUSED AUTOMATICALLY AT THE DOOR LIKE MACHINES WAITING FOR FURTHER ORDERS
7635-105409-0010 WAS FOR THE MOMENT PARALYZED WITH ASTONISHMENT WHEN HE SAW THE SOLDIERS STANDING THERE AT ATTENTION LIKE SENTRIES ON GUARD WHILST NOT A SOUND PROCEEDED FROM THE HUT FILLED WITH STRANGE ANXIOUS FOREBODING HE TOO WENT TO THE DOOR OF THE HUT AND PEERING INTO THE GLOOM HE ASKED QUICKLY
7635-105409-0011 WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS I THINK CITOYEN THAT THERE IS NO ONE THERE NOW REPLIED ONE OF THE SOLDIERS IMPERTURBABLY YOU HAVE NOT LET THOSE FOUR MEN GO THUNDERED CHAUVELIN MENACINGLY I ORDERED YOU TO LET NO MAN ESCAPE ALIVE QUICK AFTER THEM ALL OF YOU QUICK IN EVERY DIRECTION
7635-105409-0012 THE MEN OBEDIENT AS MACHINES RUSHED DOWN THE ROCKY INCLINE TOWARDS THE BEACH SOME GOING OFF TO RIGHT AND LEFT AS FAST AS THEIR FEET COULD CARRY THEM YOU AND YOUR MEN WILL PAY WITH YOUR LIVES FOR THIS BLUNDER CITOYEN SERGEANT SAID CHAUVELIN VICIOUSLY TO THE SERGEANT WHO HAD BEEN IN CHARGE OF THE MEN
7635-105409-0013 AND YOU TOO CITOYEN HE ADDED TURNING WITH A SNARL TO DESGAS FOR DISOBEYING MY ORDERS YOU ORDERED US TO WAIT CITOYEN UNTIL THE TALL ENGLISHMAN ARRIVED AND JOINED THE FOUR MEN IN THE HUT NO ONE CAME SAID THE SERGEANT SULLENLY
7635-105409-0014 BUT I ORDERED YOU JUST NOW WHEN THE WOMAN SCREAMED TO RUSH IN AND LET NO ONE ESCAPE BUT CITOYEN THE FOUR MEN WHO WERE THERE BEFORE HAD BEEN GONE SOME TIME I THINK YOU THINK YOU SAID CHAUVELIN ALMOST CHOKING WITH FURY AND YOU LET THEM GO
7635-105409-0015 YOU ORDERED US TO WAIT CITOYEN PROTESTED THE SERGEANT AND TO IMPLICITLY OBEY YOUR COMMANDS ON PAIN OF DEATH WE WAITED
7635-105409-0016 WHICH WAY DID THEY GO ASKED CHAUVELIN I COULD NOT TELL CITOYEN SAID THE SERGEANT THEY WENT STRAIGHT DOWN THE CLIFF FIRST THEN DISAPPEARED BEHIND SOME BOULDERS HUSH WHAT WAS THAT ALL THREE MEN LISTENED ATTENTIVELY
7635-105409-0017 IN THE FAR VERY FAR DISTANCE COULD BE HEARD FAINTLY ECHOING AND ALREADY DYING AWAY THE QUICK SHARP SPLASH OF HALF A DOZEN OARS CHAUVELIN TOOK OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED THE PERSPIRATION FROM HIS FOREHEAD THE SCHOONER'S BOAT WAS ALL HE GASPED
7635-105409-0018 EVIDENTLY ARMAND SAINT JUST AND HIS THREE COMPANIONS HAD MANAGED TO CREEP ALONG THE SIDE OF THE CLIFFS WHILST THE MEN LIKE TRUE SOLDIERS OF THE WELL DRILLED REPUBLICAN ARMY HAD WITH BLIND OBEDIENCE AND IN FEAR OF THEIR OWN LIVES IMPLICITLY OBEYED CHAUVELIN'S ORDERS
7635-105409-0019 TO WAIT FOR THE TALL ENGLISHMAN WHO WAS THE IMPORTANT CAPTURE THEY HAD NO DOUBT REACHED ONE OF THE CREEKS WHICH JUT FAR OUT TO SEA ON THIS COAST AT INTERVALS BEHIND THIS THE BOAT OF THE DAY DREAM MUST HAVE BEEN ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THEM
7635-105409-0020 IT NEEDED ALL CHAUVELIN'S NERVE AND PRESENCE OF MIND NOT TO GIVE WAY TO A USELESS AND UNDIGNIFIED ACCESS OF RAGE
7635-105409-0021 HOW HE HAD CONTRIVED TO REACH THE HUT WITHOUT BEING SEEN BY ONE OF THE THIRTY SOLDIERS WHO GUARDED THE SPOT WAS MORE THAN CHAUVELIN COULD CONCEIVE THAT HE HAD DONE SO BEFORE THE THIRTY MEN HAD ARRIVED ON THE CLIFF WAS OF COURSE FAIRLY CLEAR
7635-105409-0022 THERE WERE NO FAIRIES AND HOBGOBLINS ABOUT
7635-105409-0023 BY THAT TIME THE FOUR FUGITIVES MUST HAVE REACHED THE CREEK AND GOT INTO THE BOAT AND THE NEAREST CREEK WAS MORE THAN A MILE FROM THE HUT WHERE HAD THAT DARING SINGER GOT TO UNLESS SATAN HIMSELF HAD LENT HIM WINGS HE COULD NOT HAVE COVERED THAT MILE ON A ROCKY CLIFF IN THE SPACE OF TWO MINUTES
7635-105409-0024 ONE OR TWO OF THE MEN WHO HAD RUN AFTER THE FUGITIVES WERE NOW SLOWLY WORKING THEIR WAY UP THE CLIFF ONE OF THEM REACHED CHAUVELIN'S SIDE AT THE VERY MOMENT THAT THIS HOPE AROSE IN THE ASTUTE DIPLOMATIST'S HEART
7635-105409-0025 WE WERE TOO LATE CITOYEN THE SOLDIER SAID WE REACHED THE BEACH JUST BEFORE THE MOON WAS HIDDEN BY THAT BANK OF CLOUDS THE BOAT HAD UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN ON THE LOOK OUT BEHIND THAT FIRST CREEK A MILE OFF BUT SHE HAD SHOVED OFF SOME TIME AGO WHEN WE GOT TO THE BEACH AND WAS ALREADY SOME WAY OUT TO SEA
7635-105409-0026 YES SAID CHAUVELIN WITH EAGER IMPATIENCE SHE HAD SHOVED OFF SOME TIME AGO YOU SAID AND THE NEAREST CREEK IS A MILE FURTHER ON YES CITOYEN I RAN ALL THE WAY STRAIGHT TO THE BEACH THOUGH I GUESSED THE BOAT WOULD HAVE WAITED SOMEWHERE NEAR THE CREEK AS THE TIDE WOULD REACH THERE EARLIEST
7635-105409-0027 WITH A RAPID GLANCE CHAUVELIN NOTED ITS CONTENTS THE CAULDRON PLACED CLOSE UNDER AN APERTURE IN THE WALL AND CONTAINING THE LAST FEW DYING EMBERS OF BURNED CHARCOAL A COUPLE OF STOOLS OVERTURNED AS IF IN THE HASTE OF SUDDEN DEPARTURE
7635-105409-0028 THEN THE FISHERMAN'S TOOLS AND HIS NETS LYING IN ONE CORNER AND BESIDE THEM SOMETHING SMALL AND WHITE PICK THAT UP SAID CHAUVELIN TO THE SERGEANT POINTING TO THIS WHITE SCRAP AND BRING IT TO ME
7635-105409-0029 IT WAS A CRUMPLED PIECE OF PAPER EVIDENTLY FORGOTTEN THERE BY THE FUGITIVES IN THEIR HURRY TO GET AWAY THE SERGEANT MUCH AWED BY THE CITOYEN'S OBVIOUS RAGE AND IMPATIENCE PICKED THE PAPER UP AND HANDED IT RESPECTFULLY TO CHAUVELIN READ IT SERGEANT SAID THE LATTER CURTLY
7635-105409-0030 IT IS ALMOST ILLEGIBLE CITOYEN A FEARFUL SCRAWL I ORDERED YOU TO READ IT REPEATED CHAUVELIN VICIOUSLY THE SERGEANT BY THE LIGHT OF HIS LANTERN BEGAN DECIPHERING THE FEW HASTILY SCRAWLED WORDS
7635-105409-0031 I CANNOT QUITE REACH YOU WITHOUT RISKING YOUR LIVES AND ENDANGERING THE SUCCESS OF YOUR RESCUE WHEN YOU RECEIVE THIS WAIT TWO MINUTES THEN CREEP OUT OF THE HUT ONE BY ONE TURN TO YOUR LEFT SHARPLY AND CREEP CAUTIOUSLY DOWN THE CLIFF
7635-105409-0032 I SHALL BE THERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THEY MUST WAIT FOR ME AT A SAFE DISTANCE OUT AT SEA TILL THEY HEAR THE USUAL SIGNAL DO NOT DELAY AND OBEY THESE INSTRUCTIONS IMPLICITLY THEN THERE IS THE SIGNATURE CITOYEN ADDED THE SERGEANT AS HE HANDED THE PAPER BACK TO CHAUVELIN
7635-105409-0033 BUT THE LATTER HAD NOT WAITED AN INSTANT ONE PHRASE OF THE MOMENTOUS SCRAWL HAD CAUGHT HIS EAR
7635-105409-0034 THAT PHRASE MIGHT YET MEAN VICTORY FOR HIM WHICH OF YOU KNOWS THIS COAST WELL HE SHOUTED TO HIS MEN WHO NOW ONE BY ONE ALL RETURNED FROM THEIR FRUITLESS RUN AND WERE ALL ASSEMBLED ONCE MORE ROUND THE HUT
7635-105409-0035 THERE IS CITOYEN I KNOW IT WELL THE ENGLISHMAN IS HOPING TO REACH THAT CREEK
7635-105409-0036 AT ANY RATE THERE IS A CHANCE TO GET HIM YET A THOUSAND FRANCS TO EACH MAN WHO GETS TO THAT CREEK BEFORE THAT LONG LEGGED ENGLISHMAN I KNOW OF A SHORT CUT ACROSS THE CLIFFS SAID THE SOLDIER AND WITH AN ENTHUSIASTIC SHOUT HE RUSHED FORWARD FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY HIS COMRADES
7635-105409-0037 WITHIN A FEW MINUTES THEIR RUNNING FOOTSTEPS HAD DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE
7635-105409-0038 HIS WELL LAID PLAN HAD FAILED ITS SEQUEL WAS PROBLEMATICAL THERE WAS STILL A GREAT CHANCE NOW THAT THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL MIGHT YET ESCAPE AND CHAUVELIN WITH THAT UNREASONING FURY WHICH SOMETIMES ASSAILS A STRONG NATURE WAS LONGING TO VENT HIS RAGE ON SOMEBODY
7635-105409-0039 THE SOLDIERS WERE HOLDING MARGUERITE PINIONED TO THE GROUND THOUGH SHE POOR SOUL WAS NOT MAKING THE FAINTEST STRUGGLE
7635-105409-0040 HER EYES CIRCLED BY DEEP PURPLE LINES THAT TOLD OF LONG SLEEPLESS NIGHTS HER HAIR MATTED AND DAMP ROUND HER FOREHEAD HER LIPS PARTED IN A SHARP CURVE THAT SPOKE OF PHYSICAL PAIN
7635-105409-0041 BUT THE HARD VENGEFUL HEART OF HER BAFFLED ENEMY
7635-105409-0042 OBEDIENTLY THE SOLDIERS ROSE TO THEIR FEET YOU'D BETTER TRY AND FIND THAT FOOTPATH AGAIN FOR ME AND THAT BROKEN DOWN CART WE LEFT ON THE ROAD THEN SUDDENLY A BRIGHT IDEA SEEMED TO STRIKE HIM AH BY THE BYE WHERE IS THE JEW
7635-105409-0043 I GAGGED HIM AND TIED HIS LEGS TOGETHER AS YOU COMMANDED FROM THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY A PLAINTIVE MOAN REACHED CHAUVELIN'S EARS HE FOLLOWED HIS SECRETARY WHO LED THE WAY TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HUT
7635-105409-0044 WHERE FALLEN INTO AN ABSOLUTE HEAP OF DEJECTION WITH HIS LEGS TIGHTLY PINIONED TOGETHER AND HIS MOUTH GAGGED LAY THE UNFORTUNATE DESCENDANT OF ISRAEL HIS FACE IN THE SILVERY LIGHT OF THE MOON LOOKED POSITIVELY GHASTLY WITH TERROR
7635-105409-0045 WHILE A PITEOUS WAIL ESCAPED HIS BLOODLESS LIPS THE ROPE WHICH HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN WOUND ROUND HIS SHOULDERS AND ARMS HAD EVIDENTLY GIVEN WAY FOR IT LAY IN A TANGLE ABOUT HIS BODY
7635-105409-0046 LIKE A TERRIFIED CHICKEN WHICH LOOKS UPON A LINE OF WHITE CHALK DRAWN ON A TABLE AS ON A STRING WHICH PARALYZES ITS MOVEMENTS BRING THE COWARDLY BRUTE HERE COMMANDED CHAUVELIN
7635-105409-0047 HE CERTAINLY FELT EXCEEDINGLY VICIOUS AND SINCE HE HAD NO REASONABLE GROUNDS FOR VENTING HIS ILL HUMOUR ON THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD BUT TOO PUNCTUALLY OBEYED HIS ORDERS HE FELT THAT THE SON OF THE DESPISED RACE WOULD PROVE AN EXCELLENT BUTT
7635-105409-0048 WITH TRUE FRENCH CONTEMPT OF THE JEW WHICH HAS SURVIVED THE LAPSE OF CENTURIES EVEN TO THIS DAY HE WOULD NOT GO TOO NEAR HIM BUT SAID WITH BITING SARCASM AS THE WRETCHED OLD MAN WAS BROUGHT IN FULL LIGHT OF THE MOON BY THE TWO SOLDIERS
7635-105409-0049 I SUPPOSE NOW THAT BEING A JEW YOU HAVE A GOOD MEMORY FOR BARGAINS ANSWER HE AGAIN COMMANDED AS THE JEW WITH TREMBLING LIPS SEEMED TOO FRIGHTENED TO SPEAK YES YOUR HONOUR STAMMERED THE POOR WRETCH
7635-105409-0050 B BUT YOUR HONOUR THERE IS NO BUT I SAID DO YOU REMEMBER
7635-105409-0051 YOUR HONOUR HE VENTURED IMPLORINGLY SINCE YOUR TERROR SEEMS TO HAVE PARALYZED YOUR TONGUE SAID CHAUVELIN SARCASTICALLY I MUST NEEDS REFRESH YOUR MEMORY
7635-105409-0052 IT WAS AGREED BETWEEN US THAT IF WE OVERTOOK MY FRIEND THE TALL STRANGER BEFORE HE REACHED THIS PLACE YOU WERE TO HAVE TEN PIECES OF GOLD A LOW MOAN ESCAPED FROM THE JEW'S TREMBLING LIPS
7635-105409-0053 BUT ADDED CHAUVELIN WITH SLOW EMPHASIS IF YOU DECEIVED ME IN YOUR PROMISE YOU WERE TO HAVE A SOUND BEATING ONE THAT WOULD TEACH YOU NOT TO TELL LIES I DID NOT YOUR HONOUR I SWEAR IT BY ABRAHAM
7635-105409-0054 AND BY ALL THE OTHER PATRIARCHS I KNOW UNFORTUNATELY THEY ARE STILL IN HADES I BELIEVE ACCORDING TO YOUR CREED AND CANNOT HELP YOU MUCH IN YOUR PRESENT TROUBLE NOW YOU DID NOT FULFIL YOUR SHARE OF THE BARGAIN BUT I AM READY TO FULFIL MINE HERE HE ADDED TURNING TO THE SOLDIERS
7635-105409-0055 I THINK I CAN RELY ON YOU CITOYEN SOLDIERS LAUGHED CHAUVELIN MALICIOUSLY TO GIVE THIS OLD LIAR THE BEST AND SOUNDEST BEATING HE HAS EVER EXPERIENCED BUT DON'T KILL HIM HE ADDED DRILY WE WILL OBEY CITOYEN REPLIED THE SOLDIERS AS IMPERTURBABLY AS EVER
7635-105409-0056 HE DID NOT WAIT TO SEE HIS ORDERS CARRIED OUT HE KNEW THAT HE COULD TRUST THESE SOLDIERS WHO WERE STILL SMARTING UNDER HIS REBUKE NOT TO MINCE MATTERS WHEN GIVEN A FREE HAND TO BELABOUR A THIRD PARTY
7635-105409-0057 THE JEW AND THE WOMAN CAN LOOK AFTER EACH OTHER HE ADDED ROUGHLY UNTIL WE CAN SEND SOMEBODY FOR THEM IN THE MORNING THEY CAN'T RUN AWAY VERY FAR IN THEIR PRESENT CONDITION AND WE CANNOT BE TROUBLED WITH THEM JUST NOW CHAUVELIN HAD NOT GIVEN UP ALL HOPE HIS MEN HE KNEW WERE SPURRED ON BY THE HOPE OF THE REWARD
7635-105409-0058 BUT HE FELT LESS SURE NOW THE ENGLISHMAN'S AUDACITY HAD BAFFLED HIM ONCE WHILST THE WOODEN HEADED STUPIDITY OF THE SOLDIERS AND THE INTERFERENCE OF A WOMAN HAD TURNED HIS HAND WHICH HELD ALL THE TRUMPS INTO A LOSING ONE
7635-105409-0059 IT WAS A LONG IF AND CHAUVELIN STOOD FOR A MOMENT QUITE STILL AND ENROLLED THIRTY ODD PEOPLE IN ONE LONG OVERWHELMING ANATHEMA NATURE POETIC SILENT BALMY THE BRIGHT MOON THE CALM SILVERY SEA SPOKE OF BEAUTY AND OF REST
7635-105409-0060 AND CHAUVELIN CURSED NATURE CURSED MAN AND WOMAN AND ABOVE ALL HE CURSED ALL LONG LEGGED MEDDLESOME BRITISH ENIGMAS WITH ONE GIGANTIC CURSE THE HOWLS OF THE JEW BEHIND HIM UNDERGOING HIS PUNISHMENT SENT A BALM THROUGH HIS HEART
7635-105409-0061 OVERBURDENED AS IT WAS WITH REVENGEFUL MALICE HE SMILED IT EASED HIS MIND TO THINK THAT SOME HUMAN BEING AT LEAST WAS LIKE HIMSELF NOT ALTOGETHER AT PEACE WITH MANKIND HE TURNED AND TOOK A LAST LOOK AT THE LONELY BIT OF COAST WHERE STOOD THE WOODEN HUT NOW BATHED IN MOONLIGHT
7635-105409-0062 THE SCENE OF THE GREATEST DISCOMFITURE EVER EXPERIENCED BY A LEADING MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY AGAINST A ROCK ON A HARD BED OF STONE LAY THE UNCONSCIOUS FIGURE OF MARGUERITE BLAKENEY
7635-105409-0063 WHILE SOME FEW PACES FURTHER ON THE UNFORTUNATE JEW WAS RECEIVING ON HIS BROAD BACK THE BLOWS OF TWO STOUT LEATHER BELTS WIELDED BY THE STOLID ARMS OF TWO STURDY SOLDIERS OF THE REPUBLIC THE HOWLS OF BENJAMIN ROSENBAUM WERE FIT TO MAKE THE DEAD RISE FROM THEIR GRAVES
7635-105409-0064 THAT WILL DO COMMANDED CHAUVELIN AS THE JEW'S MOANS BECAME MORE FEEBLE AND THE POOR WRETCH SEEMED TO HAVE FAINTED AWAY WE DON'T WANT TO KILL HIM
7635-105409-0065 LEAVE HIM THERE SAID CHAUVELIN AND LEAD THE WAY NOW QUICKLY TO THE CART I'LL FOLLOW HE WALKED UP TO WHERE MARGUERITE LAY AND LOOKED DOWN INTO HER FACE
7635-105409-0066 SHE HAD EVIDENTLY RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS AND WAS MAKING FEEBLE EFFORTS TO RAISE HERSELF HER LARGE BLUE EYES WERE LOOKING AT THE MOONLIT SCENE ROUND HER WITH A SCARED AND TERRIFIED LOOK THEY RESTED WITH A MIXTURE OF HORROR AND PITY ON THE JEW
7635-105409-0067 WITH MOCK GALLANTRY HE STOOPED AND RAISED HER ICY COLD HAND TO HIS LIPS WHICH SENT A THRILL OF INDESCRIBABLE LOATHING THROUGH MARGUERITE'S WEARY FRAME
7635-105409-0068 I MUCH REGRET FAIR LADY HE SAID IN HIS MOST SUAVE TONES THAT CIRCUMSTANCES OVER WHICH I HAVE NO CONTROL COMPEL ME TO LEAVE YOU HERE FOR THE MOMENT BUT I GO AWAY SECURE IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I DO NOT LEAVE YOU UNPROTECTED
7635-105409-0069 I HAVE NO DOUBT AT DAWN I WILL SEND AN ESCORT FOR YOU UNTIL THEN I FEEL SURE THAT YOU WILL FIND HIM DEVOTED THOUGH PERHAPS A TRIFLE SLOW MARGUERITE ONLY HAD THE STRENGTH TO TURN HER HEAD AWAY HER HEART WAS BROKEN WITH CRUEL ANGUISH
7635-105409-0070 WHAT HAD BECOME OF PERCY WHAT OF ARMAND SHE KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AFTER SHE HEARD THE CHEERFUL SONG GOD SAVE THE KING WHICH SHE BELIEVED TO BE THE SIGNAL OF DEATH I MYSELF CONCLUDED CHAUVELIN MUST NOW VERY RELUCTANTLY LEAVE YOU
7635-105409-0071 AU REVOIR FAIR LADY WE MEET I HOPE SOON IN LONDON SHALL I SEE YOU AT THE PRINCE OF WALES GARDEN PARTY NO AH WELL AU REVOIR REMEMBER ME I PRAY TO SIR PERCY BLAKENEY
7635-105661-0000 THE PERSONS EMPLOYED IN THE FINANCES ARMIES FLEETS AND MAGISTRACY ARE INSTANCES OF THIS ORDER OF MEN IT MAY NATURALLY BE THOUGHT AT FIRST SIGHT THAT THE ECCLESIASTICS BELONG TO THE FIRST CLASS AND THAT THEIR ENCOURAGEMENT AS WELL AS THAT OF LAWYERS AND PHYSICIANS
7635-105661-0001 MAY SAFELY BE INTRUSTED TO THE LIBERALITY OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ATTACHED TO THEIR DOCTRINES AND WHO FIND BENEFIT OR CONSOLATION FROM THEIR SPIRITUAL MINISTRY AND ASSISTANCE
7635-105661-0002 FROM THEIR INCREASING PRACTICE STUDY AND ATTENTION BUT IF WE CONSIDER THE MATTER MORE CLOSELY WE SHALL FIND THAT THIS INTERESTED DILIGENCE OF THE CLERGY IS WHAT EVERY WISE LEGISLATOR WILL STUDY TO PREVENT BECAUSE IN EVERY RELIGION EXCEPT THE TRUE IT IS HIGHLY PERNICIOUS
7635-105661-0003 AND IT HAS EVEN A NATURAL TENDENCY TO PERVERT THE TRUE BY INFUSING INTO IT A STRONG MIXTURE OF SUPERSTITION FOLLY AND DELUSION EACH GHOSTLY PRACTITIONER IN ORDER TO RENDER HIMSELF MORE PRECIOUS AND SACRED IN THE EYES OF HIS RETAINERS
7635-105661-0004 WILL INSPIRE THEM WITH THE MOST VIOLENT ABHORRENCE OF ALL OTHER SECTS AND CONTINUALLY ENDEAVOR BY SOME NOVELTY TO EXCITE THE LANGUID DEVOTION OF HIS AUDIENCE NO REGARD WILL BE PAID TO TRUTH MORALS OR DECENCY IN THE DOCTRINES INCULCATED
7635-105661-0005 EVERY TENET WILL BE ADOPTED THAT BEST SUITS THE DISORDERLY AFFECTIONS OF THE HUMAN FRAME CUSTOMERS WILL BE DRAWN TO EACH CONVENTICLE BY NEW INDUSTRY AND ADDRESS IN PRACTISING ON THE PASSIONS AND CREDULITY OF THE POPULACE
7635-105661-0006 AND IN THE END THE CIVIL MAGISTRATE WILL FIND THAT HE HAS DEARLY PAID FOR HIS PRETENDED FRUGALITY IN SAVING A FIXED ESTABLISHMENT FOR THE PRIESTS AND THAT IN REALITY THE MOST DECENT AND ADVANTAGEOUS COMPOSITION WHICH HE CAN MAKE WITH THE SPIRITUAL GUIDES
7635-105661-0007 IS TO BRIBE THEIR INDOLENCE BY ASSIGNING STATED SALARIES TO THEIR PROFESSION AND RENDERING IT SUPERFLUOUS FOR THEM TO BE FURTHER ACTIVE THAN MERELY TO PREVENT THEIR FLOCK FROM STRAYING IN QUEST OF NEW PASTURES
7635-105661-0008 AND IN THIS MANNER ECCLESIASTICAL ESTABLISHMENTS THOUGH COMMONLY THEY AROSE AT FIRST FROM RELIGIOUS VIEWS PROVE IN THE END ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE POLITICAL INTERESTS OF SOCIETY
7635-105661-0009 BUT WE MAY OBSERVE THAT FEW ECCLESIASTICAL ESTABLISHMENTS HAVE BEEN FIXED UPON A WORSE FOUNDATION THAN THAT OF THE CHURCH OF ROME OR HAVE BEEN ATTENDED WITH CIRCUMSTANCES MORE HURTFUL TO THE PEACE AND HAPPINESS OF MANKIND
7635-105661-0010 THE LARGE REVENUES PRIVILEGES IMMUNITIES AND POWERS OF THE CLERGY RENDERED THEM FORMIDABLE TO THE CIVIL MAGISTRATE AND ARMED WITH TOO EXTENSIVE AUTHORITY AN ORDER OF MEN WHO ALWAYS ADHERE CLOSELY TOGETHER
7635-105661-0011 THE HIGHER DIGNITIES OF THE CHURCH SERVED INDEED TO THE SUPPORT OF GENTRY AND NOBILITY BUT BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MONASTERIES MANY OF THE LOWEST VULGAR WERE TAKEN FROM THE USEFUL ARTS AND MAINTAINED IN THOSE RECEPTACLES OF SLOTH AND IGNORANCE
7635-105661-0012 THE SUPREME HEAD OF THE CHURCH WAS A FOREIGN POTENTATE GUIDED BY INTERESTS ALWAYS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE COMMUNITY SOMETIMES CONTRARY TO THEM AND AS THE HIERARCHY WAS NECESSARILY SOLICITOUS TO PRESERVE A UNITY OF FAITH RITES AND CEREMONIES
7635-105661-0013 ALL LIBERTY OF THOUGHT RAN A MANIFEST RISK OF BEING EXTINGUISHED AND VIOLENT PERSECUTIONS OR WHAT WAS WORSE A STUPID AND ABJECT CREDULITY TOOK PLACE EVERY WHERE TO INCREASE THESE EVILS THE CHURCH
7635-105661-0014 THOUGH SHE POSSESSED LARGE REVENUES WAS NOT CONTENTED WITH HER ACQUISITIONS
7635-105661-0015 SHE EVEN BESTOWED ON EACH INDIVIDUAL PRIEST A POWER OF ENRICHING HIMSELF BY THE VOLUNTARY OBLATIONS OF THE FAITHFUL AND LEFT HIM STILL AN URGENT MOTIVE FOR DILIGENCE AND INDUSTRY IN HIS CALLING
7635-105661-0016 AND THUS THAT CHURCH THOUGH AN EXPENSIVE AND BURDENSOME ESTABLISHMENT WAS LIABLE TO MANY OF THE INCONVENIENCES WHICH BELONG TO AN ORDER OF PRIESTS TRUSTING ENTIRELY TO THEIR OWN ART AND INVENTION FOR OBTAINING A SUBSISTENCE
7635-105661-0017 THE ADVANTAGES ATTENDING THE ROMISH HIERARCHY WERE BUT A SMALL COMPENSATION FOR ITS INCONVENIENCES THE ECCLESIASTICAL PRIVILEGES DURING BARBAROUS TIMES
7635-105661-0018 AND THE POMP AND SPLENDOR OF WORSHIP WHICH BELONGED TO SO OPULENT AN ESTABLISHMENT CONTRIBUTED IN SOME RESPECT TO THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE FINE ARTS AND BEGAN TO DIFFUSE A GENERAL ELEGANCE OF TASTE BY UNITING IT WITH RELIGION
7635-105661-0019 IT WILL EASILY BE CONCEIVED THAT THOUGH THE BALANCE OF EVIL PREVAILED IN THE ROMISH CHURCH THIS WAS NOT THE CHIEF REASON WHICH PRODUCED THE REFORMATION A CONCURRENCE OF INCIDENTS MUST HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO FORWARD THAT GREAT REVOLUTION
7635-105661-0020 IN ORDER TO SUPPORT HIS PROJECTS PLEASURES AND LIBERALITIES THE SCHEME OF SELLING INDULGENCES WAS SUGGESTED TO HIM AS AN EXPEDIENT WHICH HAD OFTEN SERVED IN FORMER TIMES TO DRAW MONEY FROM THE CHRISTIAN WORLD
7635-105661-0021 AND MAKE DEVOUT PEOPLE WILLING CONTRIBUTORS TO THE GRANDEUR AND RICHES OF THE COURT OF ROME THE CHURCH IT WAS SUPPOSED WAS POSSESSED OF A GREAT STOCK OF MERIT AS BEING ENTITLED TO ALL THE GOOD WORKS OF ALL THE SAINTS BEYOND WHAT WERE EMPLOYED IN THEIR OWN JUSTIFICATION
7635-105661-0022 AND EVEN TO THE MERITS OF CHRIST HIMSELF WHICH WERE INFINITE AND UNBOUNDED AND FROM THIS UNEXHAUSTED TREASURY THE POPE MIGHT RETAIL PARTICULAR PORTIONS AND BY THAT TRAFFIC ACQUIRE MONEY TO BE EMPLOYED IN PIOUS PURPOSES IN RESISTING THE INFIDELS
7635-105661-0023 OR SUBDUING SCHISMATICS WHEN THE MONEY CAME INTO HIS EXCHEQUER THE GREATER PART OF IT WAS USUALLY DIVERTED TO OTHER PURPOSES IT IS COMMONLY BELIEVED THAT LEO FROM THE PENETRATION OF HIS GENIUS AND HIS FAMILIARITY WITH ANCIENT LITERATURE
7635-105661-0024 WAS FULLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE RIDICULE AND FALSITY OF THE DOCTRINES WHICH AS SUPREME PONTIFF
7635-105661-0025 MAY JUSTLY IN PART BE ASCRIBED TO THE LATE INVENTION OF PRINTING AND REVIVAL OF LEARNING NOT THAT REASON BORE ANY CONSIDERABLE SHARE IN OPENING MEN'S EYES WITH REGARD TO THE IMPOSTURES OF THE ROMISH CHURCH FOR OF ALL BRANCHES OF LITERATURE PHILOSOPHY HAD
7635-105661-0026 AS YET AND TILL LONG AFTERWARDS MADE THE MOST INCONSIDERABLE PROGRESS NEITHER IS THERE ANY INSTANCE THAT ARGUMENT HAS EVER BEEN ABLE TO FREE THE PEOPLE FROM THAT ENORMOUS LOAD OF ABSURDITY
7635-105661-0027 WITH WHICH SUPERSTITION HAS EVERY WHERE OVERWHELMED THEM NOT TO MENTION THAT THE RAPID ADVANCE OF THE LUTHERAN DOCTRINE AND THE VIOLENCE WITH WHICH IT WAS EMBRACED PROVE SUFFICIENTLY THAT IT OWED NOT ITS SUCCESS TO REASON AND REFLECTION
7635-105661-0028 WERE PROPAGATED MORE QUICKLY AND IN GREATER NUMBERS THE MINDS OF MEN SOMEWHAT AWAKENED FROM A PROFOUND SLEEP OF SO MANY CENTURIES WERE PREPARED FOR EVERY NOVELTY AND SCRUPLED LESS TO TREAD IN ANY UNUSUAL PATH WHICH WAS OPENED TO THEM
7635-105661-0029 AND AS COPIES OF THE SCRIPTURES AND OTHER ANCIENT MONUMENTS OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH BECAME MORE COMMON
7635-105661-0030 MANY OF THE POWERS INDEED ASSUMED BY THE CHURCH OF ROME WERE VERY ANCIENT AND WERE PRIOR TO ALMOST EVERY POLITICAL GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED IN EUROPE
7635-105661-0031 WHICH TIME MIGHT RENDER VALID BUT APPEALED STILL TO A DIVINE ORIGIN MEN WERE TEMPTED TO LOOK INTO THEIR PRIMITIVE CHARTER AND THEY COULD WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY PERCEIVE ITS DEFECT IN TRUTH AND AUTHENTICITY
7635-105661-0032 IN ORDER TO BESTOW ON THIS TOPIC THE GREATER INFLUENCE LUTHER AND HIS FOLLOWERS NOT SATISFIED WITH OPPOSING THE PRETENDED DIVINITY OF THE ROMISH CHURCH AND DISPLAYING THE TEMPORAL INCONVENIENCES OF THAT ESTABLISHMENT
7635-105661-0033 CARRIED MATTERS MUCH FURTHER AND TREATED THE RELIGION OF THEIR ANCESTORS AS ABOMINABLE DETESTABLE DAMNABLE FORETOLD BY SACRED WRIT ITSELF AS THE SOURCE OF ALL WICKEDNESS AND POLLUTION THEY DENOMINATED THE POPE ANTICHRIST
7635-105661-0034 CALLED HIS COMMUNION THE SCARLET WHORE AND GAVE TO ROME THE APPELLATION OF BABYLON EXPRESSIONS WHICH HOWEVER APPLIED WERE TO BE FOUND IN SCRIPTURE AND WHICH WERE BETTER CALCULATED TO OPERATE ON THE MULTITUDE THAN THE MOST SOLID ARGUMENTS
7635-105661-0035 EXCITED BY CONTEST AND PERSECUTION ON THE ONE HAND BY SUCCESS AND APPLAUSE ON THE OTHER MANY OF THE REFORMERS CARRIED TO THE GREATEST EXTREMITIES THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE CHURCH OF ROME
7635-105661-0036 AND IN CONTRADICTION TO THE MULTIPLIED SUPERSTITIONS WITH WHICH THAT COMMUNION WAS LOADED THEY ADOPTED AN ENTHUSIASTIC STRAIN OF DEVOTION WHICH ADMITTED OF NO OBSERVANCES RITES OR CEREMONIES BUT PLACED ALL MERIT
7635-105661-0037 IN A MYSTERIOUS SPECIES OF FAITH IN INWARD VISION RAPTURE AND ECSTASY THE NEW SECTARIES SEIZED WITH THIS SPIRIT WERE INDEFATIGABLE IN THE PROPAGATION OF THEIR DOCTRINE
7635-105661-0038 AGAINST THE ECCLESIASTICAL JURISDICTION THE LUTHERANS ADVANCED DOCTRINES FAVORABLE IN SOME RESPECT TO THE TEMPORAL AUTHORITY OF SOVEREIGNS THEY INVEIGHED AGAINST THE ABUSES OF THE COURT OF ROME
7635-105661-0039 IN THOSE POWERS OF WHICH THE ENCROACHING SPIRIT OF THE ECCLESIASTICS ESPECIALLY OF THE SOVEREIGN PONTIFF HAD SO LONG BEREAVED THEM THEY CONDEMNED CELIBACY AND MONASTIC VOWS AND THEREBY OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CONVENTS
7635-105661-0040 TO THOSE WHO WERE EITHER TIRED OF THE OBEDIENCE AND CHASTITY OR DISGUSTED WITH THE LICENSE IN WHICH THEY HAD HITHERTO LIVED THEY BLAMED THE EXCESSIVE RICHES THE IDLENESS
7635-105661-0041 THE LIBERTINISM OF THE CLERGY AND POINTED OUT THEIR TREASURES AND REVENUES AS LAWFUL SPOIL TO THE FIRST INVADER AND AS THE ECCLESIASTICS HAD HITHERTO CONDUCTED A WILLING AND A STUPID AUDIENCE AND WERE TOTALLY UNACQUAINTED WITH CONTROVERSY MUCH MORE
7635-105661-0042 WITH EVERY SPECIES OF TRUE LITERATURE THEY WERE UNABLE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST MEN ARMED WITH AUTHORITIES QUOTATIONS AND POPULAR TOPICS AND QUALIFIED TO TRIUMPH IN EVERY ALTERCATION OR DEBATE
7635-105661-0043 DIED IN THE FLOWER OF HIS AGE A LITTLE AFTER HE RECEIVED THE KING'S BOOK AGAINST LUTHER AND HE WAS SUCCEEDED IN THE PAPAL CHAIR BY ADRIAN A FLEMING WHO HAD BEEN TUTOR TO THE EMPEROR CHARLES THIS MAN WAS FITTED TO GAIN ON THE REFORMERS BY THE INTEGRITY CANDOR
7635-105661-0044 AND SIMPLICITY OF MANNERS WHICH DISTINGUISHED HIS CHARACTER BUT SO VIOLENT WERE THEIR PREJUDICES AGAINST THE CHURCH HE RATHER HURT THE CAUSE BY HIS IMPRUDENT EXERCISE OF THOSE VIRTUES HE FRANKLY CONFESSED THAT MANY ABOMINABLE AND DETESTABLE PRACTICES PREVAILED IN THE COURT OF ROME
7635-105661-0045 AND BY THIS SINCERE AVOWAL HE GAVE OCCASION OF MUCH TRIUMPH TO THE LUTHERANS THIS PONTIFF ALSO WHOSE PENETRATION WAS NOT EQUAL TO HIS GOOD INTENTIONS WAS SEDUCED TO CONCUR IN THAT LEAGUE WHICH CHARLES AND HENRY HAD FORMED AGAINST FRANCE
7635-105661-0046 AND WHO DREADED THE RESENTMENT OF THAT HAUGHTY MINISTER WAS SOLICITOUS TO REPAIR THE BREACH MADE IN THEIR FRIENDSHIP BY THIS INCIDENT
7635-105661-0047 HE RENEWED TO WOLSEY ALL THE PROMISES WHICH HE HAD MADE HIM OF SECONDING HIS PRETENSIONS TO THE PAPAL THRONE
7635-105661-0048 TO THE NEXT ELECTION THE EMPEROR RENEWED THE TREATY MADE AT BRUGES
7635-105661-0049 THE MORE TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH HENRY AND THE ENGLISH NATION HE GAVE TO SURREY ADMIRAL OF ENGLAND A COMMISSION FOR BEING ADMIRAL OF HIS DOMINIONS AND HE HIMSELF WAS INSTALLED KNIGHT OF THE GARTER AT LONDON
7780-274562-0000 THE AZURE FIELDS OF HEAVEN WERE SEMBLED RIGHT IN A LARGE ROUND SET WITH FLOW'RS OF LIGHT THE FLOWERS DE LUCE AND THE ROUND SPARKS OF DEW THAT HUNG UPON THEIR AZURE LEAVES DID SHOW LIKE TWINKLING STARS THAT SPARKLE IN THE EV'NING BLUE
7780-274562-0001 GILES FLETCHER NO MORE REMARKABLE MAN EVER LIVED THAN MY FRIEND THE YOUNG ELLISON HE WAS REMARKABLE IN THE ENTIRE AND CONTINUOUS PROFUSION OF GOOD GIFTS EVER LAVISHED UPON HIM BY FORTUNE
7780-274562-0002 FROM HIS CRADLE TO HIS GRAVE A GALE OF THE BLANDEST PROSPERITY BORE HIM ALONG NOR DO I USE THE WORD PROSPERITY IN ITS MERE WORDLY OR EXTERNAL SENSE I MEAN IT AS SYNONYMOUS WITH HAPPINESS
7780-274562-0003 THE PERSON OF WHOM I SPEAK SEEMED BORN FOR THE PURPOSE OF FORESHADOWING THE WILD DOCTRINES OF TURGOT PRICE PRIESTLEY AND CONDORCET OF EXEMPLIFYING BY INDIVIDUAL INSTANCE
7780-274562-0004 WHAT HAS BEEN DEEMED THE MERE CHIMERA OF THE PERFECTIONISTS IN THE BRIEF EXISTENCE OF ELLISON I FANCY THAT I HAVE SEEN REFUTED THE DOGMA THAT IN MAN'S PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL NATURE LIES SOME HIDDEN PRINCIPLE
7780-274562-0005 THE ANTAGONIST OF BLISS AN INTIMATE AND ANXIOUS EXAMINATION OF HIS CAREER HAS TAUGHT ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN GENERAL FROM THE VIOLATION OF A FEW SIMPLE LAWS OF HUMANITY ARISES THE WRETCHEDNESS OF MANKIND
7780-274562-0006 THAT AS A SPECIES WE HAVE IN OUR POSSESSION THE AS YET UNWROUGHT ELEMENTS OF CONTENT AND THAT EVEN NOW IN THE PRESENT BLINDNESS AND DARKNESS OF ALL IDEA ON THE GREAT QUESTION OF THE SOCIAL CONDITION
7780-274562-0007 IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE THAT MAN THE INDIVIDUAL UNDER CERTAIN UNUSUAL AND HIGHLY FORTUITOUS CONDITIONS MAY BE HAPPY WITH OPINIONS SUCH AS THESE WAS MY YOUNG FRIEND FULLY IMBUED
7780-274562-0008 AND THUS IS IT ESPECIALLY WORTHY OF OBSERVATION THAT THE UNINTERRUPTED ENJOYMENT WHICH DISTINGUISHED HIS LIFE WAS IN GREAT PART THE RESULT OF PRECONCERT IT IS INDEED EVIDENT
7780-274562-0009 EXPERIENCE MISTER ELLISON WOULD HAVE FOUND HIMSELF PRECIPITATED BY THE VERY EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESSES OF HIS LIFE INTO THE COMMON VORTEX OF UNHAPPINESS WHICH YAWNS FOR THOSE OF PREEMINENT ENDOWMENTS
7780-274562-0010 BUT IT IS BY NO MEANS MY PRESENT OBJECT TO PEN AN ESSAY ON HAPPINESS THE IDEAS OF MY FRIEND MAY BE SUMMED UP IN A FEW WORDS HE ADMITTED BUT FOUR UNVARYING LAWS
7780-274562-0011 OR RATHER ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF BLISS THAT WHICH HE CONSIDERED CHIEF WAS STRANGE TO SAY THE SIMPLE AND PURELY PHYSICAL ONE OF FREE EXERCISE IN THE OPEN AIR THE HEALTH HE SAID
7780-274562-0012 ATTAINABLE BY OTHER MEANS THAN THIS IS SCARCELY WORTH THE NAME HE POINTED TO THE TILLERS OF THE EARTH THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO AS A CLASS ARE PROVERBIALLY MORE HAPPY THAN OTHERS
7780-274562-0013 AND THEN HE INSTANCED THE HIGH ECSTASIES OF THE FOX HUNTER HIS SECOND PRINCIPLE WAS THE LOVE OF WOMAN
7780-274562-0014 HIS FOURTH WAS AN OBJECT OF UNCEASING PURSUIT AND HE HELD THAT OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL THE EXTENT OF HAPPINESS WAS PROPORTIONED TO THE SPIRITUALITY OF THIS OBJECT
7780-274562-0015 I HAVE SAID THAT ELLISON WAS REMARKABLE IN THE CONTINUOUS PROFUSION OF GOOD GIFTS LAVISHED UPON HIM BY FORTUNE IN PERSONAL GRACE AND BEAUTY HE EXCEEDED ALL MEN
7780-274562-0016 HIS INTELLECT WAS OF THAT ORDER TO WHICH THE ATTAINMENT OF KNOWLEDGE IS LESS A LABOR THAN A NECESSITY AND AN INTUITION HIS FAMILY WAS ONE OF THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS OF THE EMPIRE HIS BRIDE WAS THE LOVELIEST AND MOST DEVOTED OF WOMEN
7780-274562-0017 HIS POSSESSIONS HAD BEEN ALWAYS AMPLE BUT UPON THE ATTAINMENT OF HIS ONE AND TWENTIETH YEAR IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT ONE OF THOSE EXTRAORDINARY FREAKS OF FATE HAD BEEN PLAYED IN HIS BEHALF WHICH STARTLE THE WHOLE SOCIAL WORLD AMID WHICH THEY OCCUR
7780-274562-0018 AND SELDOM FAIL RADICALLY TO ALTER THE ENTIRE MORAL CONSTITUTION OF THOSE WHO ARE THEIR OBJECTS IT APPEARS THAT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS PRIOR TO MISTER ELLISON'S ATTAINMENT OF HIS MAJORITY THERE HAD DIED IN A REMOTE PROVINCE
7780-274562-0019 ELLISON THIS GENTLEMEN HAD AMASSED A PRINCELY FORTUNE AND HAVING NO VERY IMMEDIATE CONNEXIONS CONCEIVED THE WHIM OF SUFFERING HIS WEALTH TO ACCUMULATE FOR A CENTURY AFTER HIS DECEASE
7780-274562-0020 MINUTELY AND SAGACIOUSLY DIRECTING THE VARIOUS MODES OF INVESTMENT HE BEQUEATHED THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT TO THE NEAREST OF BLOOD BEARING THE NAME ELLISON WHO SHOULD BE ALIVE AT THE END OF THE HUNDRED YEARS
7780-274562-0021 MANY FUTILE ATTEMPTS HAD BEEN MADE TO SET ASIDE THIS SINGULAR BEQUEST THEIR EX POST FACTO CHARACTER RENDERED THEM ABORTIVE
7780-274562-0022 A DECREE FINALLY OBTAINED FORBIDDING ALL SIMILAR ACCUMULATIONS THIS ACT DID NOT PREVENT YOUNG ELLISON UPON HIS TWENTY FIRST BIRTH DAY
7780-274562-0023 FROM ENTERING INTO POSSESSION AS THE HEIR OF HIS ANCESTOR SEABRIGHT OF A FORTUNE OF
7780-274562-0024 THERE WERE OF COURSE MANY SPECULATIONS AS TO THE MODE OF ITS DISPOSAL THE GIGANTIC MAGNITUDE AND THE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE NATURE OF THE SUM DAZZLED AND BEWILDERED ALL WHO THOUGHT UPON THE TOPIC
7780-274562-0025 THE POSSESSOR OF ANY APPRECIABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN IMAGINED TO PERFORM ANY ONE OF A THOUSAND THINGS WITH RICHES MERELY SURPASSING THOSE OF ANY CITIZEN
7780-274562-0026 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO SUPPOSE HIM ENGAGING TO SUPREME EXCESS IN THE FASHIONABLE EXTRAVAGANCES OF HIS TIME OR BUSYING HIMSELF WITH POLITICAL INTRIGUES OR AIMING AT MINISTERIAL POWER OR PURCHASING INCREASE OF NOBILITY
7780-274562-0027 OR DEVISING GORGEOUS ARCHITECTURAL PILES OR COLLECTING LARGE SPECIMENS OF VIRTU OR PLAYING THE MUNIFICENT PATRON OF LETTERS AND ART OR ENDOWING AND BESTOWING HIS NAME UPON EXTENSIVE INSTITUTIONS OF CHARITY
7780-274562-0028 BUT FOR THE INCONCEIVABLE WEALTH IN THE ACTUAL POSSESSION OF THE YOUNG HEIR THESE OBJECTS AND ALL ORDINARY OBJECTS WERE FELT TO BE INADEQUATE RECOURSE WAS HAD TO FIGURES
7780-274562-0029 AND FIGURES BUT SUFFICED TO CONFOUND IT WAS SEEN THAT EVEN AT THREE PER CENT THE ANNUAL INCOME OF THE INHERITANCE AMOUNTED TO NO LESS THAN THIRTEEN MILLIONS AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
7780-274562-0030 WHICH WAS ONE MILLION AND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PER MONTH OR THIRTY SIX THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX PER DAY OR ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE PER HOUR OR
7780-274562-0031 SIX AND TWENTY DOLLARS FOR EVERY MINUTE THAT FLEW THUS THE USUAL TRACK OF SUPPOSITION WAS THOROUGHLY BROKEN UP MEN KNEW NOT WHAT TO IMAGINE
7780-274562-0032 ENRICHING WHOLE TROOPS OF HIS RELATIVES BY DIVISION OF HIS SUPERABUNDANCE I WAS NOT SURPRISED HOWEVER
7780-274562-0033 NOR WAS I GREATLY ASTONISHED AT THE NATURE OF HIS DECISION IN THE WIDEST AND NOBLEST SENSE HE WAS A POET HE COMPREHENDED MOREOVER THE TRUE CHARACTER THE AUGUST AIMS
7780-274562-0034 THE SUPREME MAJESTY AND DIGNITY OF THE POETIC SENTIMENT THE PROPER GRATIFICATION OF THE SENTIMENT HE INSTINCTIVELY FELT TO LIE IN THE CREATION OF NOVEL FORMS OF BEAUTY SOME PECULIARITIES EITHER IN HIS EARLY EDUCATION
7780-274562-0035 OR IN THE NATURE OF HIS INTELLECT
7780-274562-0036 AND IT WAS THIS BIAS PERHAPS WHICH IMPERCEPTIBLY LED HIM TO PERCEIVE THAT THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS IF NOT THE SOLE LEGITIMATE FIELD FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE POETIC SENTIMENT
7780-274562-0037 WAS TO BE FOUND IN THE CREATION OF NOVEL MOODS OF PURELY PHYSICAL LOVELINESS THUS IT HAPPENED THAT HE BECAME NEITHER MUSICIAN NOR POET IF WE USE THIS LATTER TERM IN ITS EVERY DAY ACCEPTATION
7780-274562-0038 OR IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT HE BECAME NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER IN PURSUANCE OF AN IDEA OF HIS WHICH I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THE IDEA THAT IN THE CONTEMPT OF AMBITION LAY ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES OF HAPPINESS ON EARTH
7780-274562-0039 IS IT NOT INDEED POSSIBLE THAT WHILE A HIGH ORDER OF GENIUS IS NECESSARILY AMBITIOUS THE HIGHEST IS INVARIABLY ABOVE THAT WHICH IS TERMED AMBITION
7780-274562-0040 AND MAY IT NOT THUS HAPPEN THAT MANY FAR GREATER THAN MILTON HAVE CONTENTEDLY REMAINED MUTE AND INGLORIOUS I BELIEVE THE WORLD HAS NEVER YET SEEN AND THAT
7780-274562-0041 UNLESS THROUGH SOME SERIES OF ACCIDENTS GOADING THE NOBLEST ORDER OF MIND INTO DISTASTEFUL EXERTION THE WORLD WILL NEVER BEHOLD THAT FULL EXTENT OF TRIUMPHANT EXECUTION IN THE RICHER PRODUCTIONS OF ART
7780-274562-0042 OF WHICH THE HUMAN NATURE IS ABSOLUTELY CAPABLE MISTER ELLISON BECAME NEITHER MUSICIAN NOR POET ALTHOUGH NO MAN LIVED MORE PROFOUNDLY ENAMORED BOTH OF MUSIC AND THE MUSE
7780-274562-0043 UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAN THOSE WHICH INVESTED HIM IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE WOULD HAVE BECOME A PAINTER THE FIELD OF SCULPTURE ALTHOUGH IN ITS NATURE RIGIDLY POETICAL
7780-274562-0044 WAS TOO LIMITED IN ITS EXTENT AND IN ITS CONSEQUENCES TO HAVE OCCUPIED AT ANY TIME MUCH OF HIS ATTENTION AND I HAVE NOW MENTIONED ALL THE PROVINCES IN WHICH
7780-274562-0045 EVEN THE MOST LIBERAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE POETIC SENTIMENT HAS DECLARED THIS SENTIMENT CAPABLE OF EXPATIATING I MEAN THE MOST LIBERAL PUBLIC OR RECOGNIZED CONCEPTION OF THE IDEA INVOLVED IN THE PHRASE POETIC SENTIMENT
7780-274562-0046 NO DEFINITION HAD SPOKEN OF THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER AS OF THE POET YET MY FRIEND COULD NOT FAIL TO PERCEIVE THAT THE CREATION OF THE LANDSCAPE GARDEN OFFERED TO THE TRUE MUSE THE MOST MAGNIFICENT OF OPPORTUNITIES
7780-274562-0047 HERE WAS INDEED THE FAIREST FIELD FOR THE DISPLAY OF INVENTION OR IMAGINATION IN THE ENDLESS COMBINING OF FORMS OF NOVEL BEAUTY
7780-274562-0048 THE ELEMENTS WHICH SHOULD ENTER INTO COMBINATION BEING AT ALL TIMES AND BY A VAST SUPERIORITY THE MOST GLORIOUS WHICH THE EARTH COULD AFFORD IN THE MULTIFORM OF THE TREE
7780-274562-0049 AND IN THE MULTICOLOR OF THE FLOWER HE RECOGNIZED THE MOST DIRECT AND THE MOST ENERGETIC EFFORTS OF NATURE AT PHYSICAL LOVELINESS AND IN THE DIRECTION OR CONCENTRATION OF THIS EFFORT OR
7780-274562-0050 HE PERCEIVED THAT HE SHOULD BE EMPLOYING THE BEST MEANS LABORING TO THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE IN THE FULFILMENT OF HIS DESTINY AS POET
7780-274562-0051 ITS ADAPTATION TO THE EYES WHICH WERE TO BEHOLD IT UPON EARTH IN HIS EXPLANATION OF THIS PHRASEOLOGY MISTER ELLISON DID MUCH TOWARDS SOLVING WHAT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME AN ENIGMA I MEAN THE FACT
7780-274562-0052 WHICH NONE BUT THE IGNORANT DISPUTE THAT NO SUCH COMBINATIONS OF SCENERY EXIST IN NATURE AS THE PAINTER OF GENIUS HAS IN HIS POWER TO PRODUCE
7780-274562-0053 WHILE THE COMPONENT PARTS MAY EXCEED INDIVIDUALLY THE HIGHEST SKILL OF THE ARTIST THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE PARTS WILL ALWAYS BE SUSCEPTIBLE OF IMPROVEMENT IN SHORT NO POSITION CAN BE ATTAINED
7780-274562-0054 FROM WHICH AN ARTISTICAL EYE LOOKING STEADILY WILL NOT FIND MATTER OF OFFENCE IN WHAT IS TECHNICALLY TERMED THE COMPOSITION OF A NATURAL LANDSCAPE AND YET HOW UNINTELLIGIBLE IS THIS
7780-274562-0055 IN ALL OTHER MATTERS WE ARE JUSTLY INSTRUCTED TO REGARD NATURE AS SUPREME WITH HER DETAILS WE SHRINK FROM COMPETITION WHO SHALL PRESUME TO IMITATE THE COLORS OF THE TULIP OR TO IMPROVE THE PROPORTIONS OF THE LILY OF THE VALLEY
7780-274562-0056 THE CRITICISM WHICH SAYS OF SCULPTURE OR OF PORTRAITURE THAT NATURE IS TO BE EXALTED RATHER THAN IMITATED IS IN ERROR NO PICTORIAL OR SCULPTURAL COMBINATIONS OF POINTS
7780-274562-0057 OF HUMAN LOVELINESS DO MORE THAN APPROACH THE LIVING AND BREATHING HUMAN BEAUTY AS IT GLADDENS OUR DAILY PATH BYRON WHO OFTEN ERRED ERRED NOT IN SAYING I'VE SEEN MORE LIVING BEAUTY
7780-274562-0058 RIPE AND REAL THAN ALL THE NONSENSE OF THEIR STONE IDEAL IN LANDSCAPE ALONE IS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE CRITIC TRUE AND HAVING FELT ITS TRUTH HERE
7780-274562-0059 IT IS BUT THE HEADLONG SPIRIT OF GENERALIZATION WHICH HAS INDUCED HIM TO PRONOUNCE IT TRUE THROUGHOUT ALL THE DOMAINS OF ART HAVING I SAY FELT ITS TRUTH HERE
7780-274562-0060 FOR THE FEELING IS NO AFFECTATION OR CHIMERA THE MATHEMATICS AFFORD NO MORE ABSOLUTE DEMONSTRATIONS THAN THE SENTIMENT OF HIS ART YIELDS TO THE ARTIST HE NOT ONLY BELIEVES
7780-274562-0061 BUT POSITIVELY KNOWS THAT SUCH AND SUCH APPARENTLY ARBITRARY ARRANGEMENTS OF MATTER OR FORM CONSTITUTE AND ALONE CONSTITUTE THE TRUE BEAUTY
7780-274562-0062 YET HIS REASONS HAVE NOT YET BEEN MATURED INTO EXPRESSION IT REMAINS FOR A MORE PROFOUND ANALYSIS THAN THE WORLD HAS YET SEEN FULLY TO INVESTIGATE AND EXPRESS THEM
7780-274562-0063 IN HIS INSTINCTIVE OPINIONS BY THE CONCURRENCE OF ALL HIS COMPEERS LET A COMPOSITION BE DEFECTIVE LET AN EMENDATION BE WROUGHT IN ITS MERE ARRANGEMENT OF FORM
7780-274562-0064 LET THIS EMENDATION BE SUBMITTED TO EVERY ARTIST IN THE WORLD BY EACH WILL ITS NECESSITY BE ADMITTED AND EVEN FAR MORE THAN THIS IN REMEDY OF THE DEFECTIVE COMPOSITION
7780-274562-0065 EACH INSULATED MEMBER OF THE FRATERNITY WILL SUGGEST THE IDENTICAL EMENDATION I REPEAT THAT IN LANDSCAPE ARRANGEMENTS OR COLLOCATIONS ALONE IS THE PHYSICAL NATURE SUSCEPTIBLE OF EXALTATION AND THAT
7780-274562-0066 THEREFORE HER SUSCEPTIBILITY OF IMPROVEMENT
7780-274562-0067 IT WAS MISTER ELLISON WHO FIRST SUGGESTED THE IDEA THAT WHAT WE REGARDED AS IMPROVEMENT OR EXALTATION OF THE NATURAL BEAUTY
7780-274562-0068 THAT EACH ALTERATION OR DISTURBANCE OF THE PRIMITIVE SCENERY MIGHT POSSIBLY EFFECT A BLEMISH IN THE PICTURE IF WE COULD SUPPOSE THIS PICTURE VIEWED AT LARGE FROM SOME REMOTE POINT IN THE HEAVENS
7780-274562-0069 IT IS EASILY UNDERSTOOD SAYS MISTER ELLISON THAT WHAT MIGHT IMPROVE A CLOSELY SCRUTINIZED DETAIL MIGHT AT THE SAME TIME INJURE A GENERAL AND MORE DISTANTLY OBSERVED EFFECT
7780-274562-0070 HE SPOKE UPON THIS TOPIC WITH WARMTH REGARDING NOT SO MUCH ITS IMMEDIATE OR OBVIOUS IMPORTANCE WHICH IS LITTLE
7780-274562-0071 OR OF THE COLLATERAL PROPOSITIONS WHICH IT MIGHT SERVE TO CORROBORATE OR SUSTAIN THERE MIGHT BE A CLASS OF BEINGS HUMAN ONCE BUT NOW TO HUMANITY INVISIBLE
7780-274562-0072 FOR WHOSE SCRUTINY AND FOR WHOSE REFINED APPRECIATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL MORE ESPECIALLY THAN FOR OUR OWN HAD BEEN SET IN ORDER BY GOD THE GREAT LANDSCAPE GARDEN OF THE WHOLE EARTH IN THE COURSE OF OUR DISCUSSION
7780-274562-0073 TO HAVE WELL TREATED THIS THEME THERE ARE PROPERLY HE WRITES BUT TWO STYLES OF LANDSCAPE GARDENING THE NATURAL AND THE ARTIFICIAL
7780-274562-0074 ONE SEEKS TO RECALL THE ORIGINAL BEAUTY OF THE COUNTRY BY ADAPTING ITS MEANS TO THE SURROUNDING SCENERY CULTIVATING TREES IN HARMONY WITH THE HILLS OR PLAIN OF THE NEIGHBORING LAND
7780-274562-0075 DETECTING AND BRINGING INTO PRACTICE THOSE NICE RELATIONS OF SIZE PROPORTION AND COLOR WHICH HID FROM THE COMMON OBSERVER ARE REVEALED EVERYWHERE TO THE EXPERIENCED STUDENT OF NATURE THE RESULT OF THE NATURAL STYLE OF GARDENING
7780-274562-0076 IN THE PREVALENCE OF A BEAUTIFUL HARMONY AND ORDER THAN IN THE CREATION OF ANY SPECIAL WONDERS OR MIRACLES THE ARTIFICIAL STYLE HAS AS MANY VARIETIES AS THERE ARE DIFFERENT TASTES TO GRATIFY
7780-274562-0077 IT HAS A CERTAIN GENERAL RELATION TO THE VARIOUS STYLES OF BUILDING THERE ARE THE STATELY AVENUES AND RETIREMENTS OF VERSAILLES ITALIAN TERRACES AND A VARIOUS MIXED OLD ENGLISH STYLE
7780-274562-0078 WHICH BEARS SOME RELATION TO THE DOMESTIC GOTHIC OR ENGLISH ELIZABETHAN ARCHITECTURE WHATEVER MAY BE SAID AGAINST THE ABUSES OF THE ARTIFICIAL LANDSCAPE GARDENING
7780-274562-0079 A MIXTURE OF PURE ART IN A GARDEN SCENE ADDS TO IT A GREAT BEAUTY THIS IS PARTLY PLEASING TO THE EYE BY THE SHOW OF ORDER AND DESIGN AND PARTLY MORAL A TERRACE
7780-274562-0080 CALLS UP AT ONCE TO THE EYE THE FAIR FORMS THAT HAVE PASSED THERE IN OTHER DAYS THE SLIGHTEST EXHIBITION OF ART IS AN EVIDENCE OF CARE AND HUMAN INTEREST
7780-274562-0081 FROM WHAT I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED SAID MISTER ELLISON YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT I REJECT THE IDEA HERE EXPRESSED OF RECALLING THE ORIGINAL BEAUTY OF THE COUNTRY
7780-274562-0082 THE ORIGINAL BEAUTY IS NEVER SO GREAT AS THAT WHICH MAY BE INTRODUCED OF COURSE MUCH DEPENDS UPON THE SELECTION OF A SPOT WITH CAPABILITIES
7780-274562-0083 WHAT IS SAID IN RESPECT TO THE DETECTING AND BRINGING INTO PRACTICE THOSE NICE RELATIONS OF SIZE PROPORTION AND COLOR IS A MERE VAGUENESS OF SPEECH WHICH MAY MEAN MUCH OR LITTLE OR NOTHING
7780-274562-0084 THAT THE TRUE RESULT OF THE NATURAL STYLE OF GARDENING IS SEEN RATHER IN THE ABSENCE OF ALL DEFECTS AND INCONGRUITIES THAN IN THE CREATION OF ANY SPECIAL WONDERS OR MIRACLES
7780-274562-0085 IS A PROPOSITION BETTER SUITED TO THE GROVELLING APPREHENSION OF THE HERD THAN TO THE FERVID DREAMS OF THE MAN OF GENIUS THE MERIT SUGGESTED IS AT BEST NEGATIVE
7780-274562-0086 AND APPERTAINS TO THAT HOBBLING CRITICISM WHICH IN LETTERS WOULD ELEVATE ADDISON INTO APOTHEOSIS IN TRUTH
7780-274562-0087 APPEALS DIRECTLY TO THE UNDERSTANDING AND CAN THUS BE FORESHADOWED IN RULE THE LOFTIER MERIT WHICH BREATHES AND FLAMES IN INVENTION OR CREATION CAN BE APPREHENDED SOLELY IN ITS RESULTS
7780-274562-0088 RULE APPLIES BUT TO THE EXCELLENCES OF AVOIDANCE TO THE VIRTUES WHICH DENY OR REFRAIN BEYOND THESE THE CRITICAL ART CAN BUT SUGGEST
7780-274562-0089 WE MAY BE INSTRUCTED TO BUILD AN ODYSSEY BUT IT IS IN VAIN THAT WE ARE TOLD HOW TO CONCEIVE A TEMPEST AN INFERNO A PROMETHEUS BOUND A NIGHTINGALE
7780-274562-0090 SUCH AS THAT OF KEATS OR THE SENSITIVE PLANT OF SHELLEY BUT THE THING DONE
7780-274562-0091 THE SOPHISTS OF THE NEGATIVE SCHOOL WHO THROUGH INABILITY TO CREATE HAVE SCOFFED AT CREATION ARE NOW FOUND THE LOUDEST IN APPLAUSE WHAT
7780-274562-0092 IN ITS CHRYSALIS CONDITION OF PRINCIPLE AFFRONTED THEIR DEMURE REASON NEVER FAILS IN ITS MATURITY OF ACCOMPLISHMENT TO EXTORT ADMIRATION FROM THEIR INSTINCT OF THE BEAUTIFUL OR OF THE SUBLIME
7780-274562-0093 ARE LESS OBJECTIONABLE A MIXTURE OF PURE ART IN A GARDEN SCENE ADDS TO IT A GREAT BEAUTY THIS IS JUST AND THE REFERENCE TO THE SENSE OF HUMAN INTEREST IS EQUALLY SO
7780-274562-0094 I REPEAT THAT THE PRINCIPLE HERE EXPRESSED IS INCONTROVERTIBLE BUT THERE MAY BE SOMETHING EVEN BEYOND IT THERE MAY BE AN OBJECT IN FULL KEEPING WITH THE PRINCIPLE SUGGESTED
7780-274562-0095 YET WHICH IF ATTAINED WOULD LEND A CHARM TO THE LANDSCAPE GARDEN IMMEASURABLY SURPASSING THAT WHICH A MERELY HUMAN INTEREST COULD BESTOW
7780-274562-0096 SO IMBUE HIS DESIGNS AT ONCE WITH EXTENT AND NOVELTY OF BEAUTY AS TO CONVEY THE SENTIMENT OF SPIRITUAL INTERFERENCE IT WILL BE SEEN THAT IN BRINGING ABOUT SUCH RESULT
7780-274562-0097 HE SECURES ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF INTEREST OR DESIGN WHILE RELIEVING HIS WORK OF ALL THE HARSHNESS AND TECHNICALITY OF ART
7780-274562-0098 IN THE MOST SAVAGE OF THE SCENES OF PURE NATURE THERE IS APPARENT THE ART OF A CREATOR YET IS THIS ART APPARENT ONLY TO REFLECTION IN NO RESPECT HAS IT THE OBVIOUS FORCE OF A FEELING
7780-274562-0099 NOW IF WE IMAGINE THIS SENSE OF THE ALMIGHTY DESIGN TO BE HARMONIZED IN A MEASURABLE DEGREE IF WE SUPPOSE A LANDSCAPE WHOSE COMBINED STRANGENESS VASTNESS
7780-274562-0100 DEFINITIVENESS AND MAGNIFICENCE SHALL INSPIRE THE IDEA OF CULTURE OR CARE OR SUPERINTENDENCE ON THE PART OF INTELLIGENCES SUPERIOR YET AKIN TO HUMANITY
7780-274562-0101 THEN THE SENTIMENT OF INTEREST IS PRESERVED WHILE THE ART IS MADE TO ASSUME THE AIR OF AN INTERMEDIATE OR SECONDARY NATURE A NATURE WHICH IS NOT GOD NOR AN EMANATION OF GOD
7780-274562-0102 IN THE SENSE THAT IT IS THE HANDIWORK OF THE ANGELS THAT HOVER BETWEEN MAN AND GOD IT WAS IN DEVOTING HIS GIGANTIC WEALTH TO THE PRACTICAL EMBODIMENT OF A VISION SUCH AS THIS
7780-274562-0103 IN THE FREE EXERCISE IN THE OPEN AIR WHICH RESULTED FROM PERSONAL DIRECTION OF HIS PLANS IN THE CONTINUOUS AND UNCEASING OBJECT WHICH THESE PLANS AFFORD
7780-274562-0104 IN THE CONTEMPT OF AMBITION WHICH IT ENABLED HIM MORE TO FEEL THAN TO AFFECT AND LASTLY IT WAS IN THE COMPANIONSHIP AND SYMPATHY OF A DEVOTED WIFE
7780-274562-0105 THAT ELLISON THOUGHT TO FIND AND FOUND AN EXEMPTION FROM THE ORDINARY CARES OF HUMANITY
7794-295947-0000 ON THE SAME ERRAND AS THEMSELVES AS SOON AS THE CHILDREN SAW THE FOXES THEY PICKED UP A BAMBOO STICK AND TOOK THE CREATURES STEALTHILY IN THE REAR AND WHEN THE OLD FOXES TOOK TO FLIGHT THEY SURROUNDED THEM AND BEAT THEM WITH THE STICK
7794-295947-0001 SO THAT THEY RAN AWAY AS FAST AS THEIR LEGS COULD CARRY THEM BUT TWO OF THE BOYS HELD DOWN THE CUB AND SEIZING IT BY THE SCRUFF OF THE NECK WENT OFF IN HIGH GLEE THE TWO FRIENDS WERE LOOKING ON ALL THE WHILE AND ONE OF THEM RAISING HIS VOICE SHOUTED OUT
7794-295947-0002 HALLO YOU BOYS WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT FOX THE ELDEST OF THE BOYS REPLIED WE'RE GOING TO TAKE HIM HOME AND SELL HIM TO A YOUNG MAN IN OUR VILLAGE HE'LL BUY HIM AND THEN HE'LL BOIL HIM IN A POT AND EAT HIM
7794-295947-0003 WELL REPLIED THE OTHER AFTER CONSIDERING THE MATTER ATTENTIVELY I SUPPOSE IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU WHOM YOU SELL HIM TO YOU'D BETTER LET ME HAVE HIM OH BUT THE YOUNG MAN FROM OUR VILLAGE PROMISED US A GOOD SUM IF WE COULD FIND A FOX
7794-295947-0004 AND GOT US TO COME OUT TO THE HILLS AND CATCH ONE AND SO WE CAN'T SELL HIM TO YOU AT ANY PRICE WELL I SUPPOSE IT CANNOT BE HELPED THEN BUT HOW MUCH WOULD THE YOUNG MAN GIVE YOU FOR THE CUB OH HE'LL GIVE US THREE HUNDRED CASH AT LEAST
7794-295947-0005 AND GAVE HALF A BU TO THE THREE BOYS WHO RAN AWAY DELIGHTED THE MAN'S FRIEND UPON THIS SAID TO HIM WELL CERTAINLY YOU HAVE GOT QUEER TASTES WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP THE FOX FOR
7794-295947-0006 HOW COULD I STAND BY AND SEE LIFE TAKEN IT WAS BUT A LITTLE I SPENT ONLY HALF A BU TO SAVE THE CUB BUT HAD IT COST A FORTUNE I SHOULD NOT HAVE GRUDGED IT I THOUGHT YOU WERE INTIMATE ENOUGH WITH ME TO KNOW MY HEART
7794-295947-0007 BUT TO DAY YOU HAVE ACCUSED ME OF BEING ECCENTRIC AND I SEE HOW MISTAKEN I HAVE BEEN IN YOU HOWEVER OUR FRIENDSHIP SHALL CEASE FROM THIS DAY FORTH AND WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF FIRMNESS
7794-295947-0008 THE OTHER RETIRING BACKWARD AND BOWING WITH HIS HANDS ON HIS KNEES REPLIED INDEED INDEED I AM FILLED WITH ADMIRATION AT THE GOODNESS OF YOUR HEART WHEN I HEAR YOU SPEAK THUS I FEEL MORE THAN EVER HOW GREAT IS THE LOVE I BEAR YOU
7794-295947-0009 SO THEY STROKED IT GENTLY ON THE BACK AND PETTED IT AND AS THE PAIN OF THE WOUND SEEMED TO HAVE SUBSIDED THEY WERE ADMIRING THE PROPERTIES OF THE HERB WHEN OPPOSITE TO THEM THEY SAW THE OLD FOXES SITTING WATCHING THEM BY THE SIDE OF SOME STACKS OF RICE STRAW
7794-295947-0010 LOOK THERE THE OLD FOXES HAVE COME BACK OUT OF FEAR FOR THEIR CUB'S SAFETY COME WE WILL SET IT FREE AND WITH THESE WORDS THEY UNTIED THE STRING ROUND THE CUB'S NECK AND TURNED ITS HEAD TOWARD THE SPOT WHERE THE OLD FOXES SAT
7794-295947-0011 SO WITH PEACE IN THEIR HEARTS THE LATTER WENT OFF TO ANOTHER PLACE AND CHOOSING A PRETTY SPOT PRODUCED THE WINE BOTTLE AND ATE THEIR NOONDAY MEAL AND AFTER A PLEASANT DAY THEY RETURNED TO THEIR HOMES AND BECAME FIRMER FRIENDS THAN EVER
7794-295947-0012 NOW THE MAN WHO HAD RESCUED THE FOX'S CUB WAS A TRADESMAN IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES HE HAD THREE OR FOUR AGENTS AND TWO MAID SERVANTS BESIDES MEN SERVANTS AND ALTOGETHER HE LIVED IN A LIBERAL MANNER HE WAS MARRIED AND THIS UNION HAD BROUGHT HIM ONE SON
7794-295947-0013 EVEN THOUGH OUR CHILD SHOULD DIE FOR IT THEY SAID WE WILL NOT OURSELVES DEPRIVE OTHER CREATURES OF THEIR LIVES BUT YOU WHO LIVE AMONG THE HILLS ARE SURE TO HEAR WHEN YOUR NEIGHBOURS GO OUT FOX HUNTING
7794-295947-0014 WE DON'T CARE WHAT PRICE WE MIGHT HAVE TO PAY FOR A FOX'S LIVER PRAY BUY ONE FOR US AT ANY EXPENSE SO THEY PRESSED HIM TO EXERT HIMSELF ON THEIR BEHALF AND HE HAVING PROMISED FAITHFULLY TO EXECUTE THE COMMISSION WENT HIS WAY
7794-295947-0015 IN THE NIGHT OF THE FOLLOWING DAY THERE CAME A MESSENGER WHO ANNOUNCED HIMSELF AS COMING FROM THE PERSON WHO HAD UNDERTAKEN TO PROCURE THE FOX'S LIVER SO THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WENT OUT TO SEE HIM I HAVE COME FROM MISTER SO AND SO
7794-295947-0016 LAST NIGHT THE FOX'S LIVER THAT YOU REQUIRED FELL INTO HIS HANDS SO HE SENT ME TO BRING IT TO YOU WITH THESE WORDS THE MESSENGER PRODUCED A SMALL JAR ADDING IN A FEW DAYS HE WILL LET YOU KNOW THE PRICE
7794-295947-0017 WHEN HE HAD DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WAS GREATLY PLEASED AND SAID INDEED I AM DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR THIS KINDNESS WHICH WILL SAVE MY SON'S LIFE THEN THE GOOD WIFE CAME OUT AND RECEIVED THE JAR WITH EVERY MARK OF POLITENESS
7794-295947-0018 WE MUST MAKE A PRESENT TO THE MESSENGER INDEED SIR I'VE ALREADY BEEN PAID FOR MY TROUBLE WELL AT ANY RATE YOU MUST STOP THE NIGHT HERE THANK YOU SIR I'VE A RELATION IN THE NEXT VILLAGE WHOM I HAVE NOT SEEN FOR A LONG WHILE
7794-295947-0019 AND I WILL PASS THE NIGHT WITH HIM AND SO HE TOOK HIS LEAVE AND WENT AWAY THE PARENTS LOST NO TIME IN SENDING TO LET THE PHYSICIAN KNOW THAT THEY HAD PROCURED THE FOX'S LIVER THE NEXT DAY THE DOCTOR CAME AND COMPOUNDED A MEDICINE FOR THE PATIENT
7794-295947-0020 WHICH AT ONCE PRODUCED A GOOD EFFECT AND THERE WAS NO LITTLE JOY IN THE HOUSEHOLD AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT THREE DAYS AFTER THIS THE MAN WHOM THEY HAD COMMISSIONED TO BUY THE FOX'S LIVER CAME TO THE HOUSE SO THE GOODWIFE HURRIED OUT TO MEET HIM AND WELCOME HIM
7794-295947-0021 HOW QUICKLY YOU FULFILLED OUR WISHES AND HOW KIND OF YOU TO SEND AT ONCE THE DOCTOR PREPARED THE MEDICINE AND NOW OUR BOY CAN GET UP AND WALK ABOUT THE ROOM AND IT'S ALL OWING TO YOUR GOODNESS WAIT A BIT CRIED THE GUEST
7794-295947-0022 WHO DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THE JOY OF THE TWO PARENTS THE COMMISSION WITH WHICH YOU ENTRUSTED ME ABOUT THE FOX'S LIVER TURNED OUT TO BE A MATTER OF IMPOSSIBILITY SO I CAME TO DAY TO MAKE MY EXCUSES AND NOW I REALLY CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SO GRATEFUL TO ME FOR
7794-295947-0023 PRAY INQUIRE CAREFULLY INTO THE MATTER WELL THIS IS VERY STRANGE FOUR NIGHTS AGO A MAN OF SOME FIVE OR SIX AND THIRTY YEARS OF AGE CAME WITH A VERBAL MESSAGE FROM YOU TO THE EFFECT THAT YOU HAD SENT HIM WITH A FOX'S LIVER
7794-295947-0024 WHICH YOU HAD JUST PROCURED AND SAID THAT HE WOULD COME AND TELL US THE PRICE ANOTHER DAY WHEN WE ASKED HIM TO SPEND THE NIGHT HERE HE ANSWERED THAT HE WOULD LODGE WITH A RELATION IN THE NEXT VILLAGE AND WENT AWAY THE VISITOR WAS MORE AND MORE LOST IN AMAZEMENT AND
7794-295947-0025 LAST SPRING WHEN I WAS TAKING OUT MY CUB TO PLAY IT WAS CARRIED OFF BY SOME BOYS AND ONLY SAVED BY YOUR GOODNESS THE DESIRE TO REQUITE THIS KINDNESS PIERCED ME TO THE QUICK AT LAST WHEN CALAMITY ATTACKED YOUR HOUSE
7794-295947-0026 I THOUGHT I MIGHT BE OF USE TO YOU YOUR SON'S ILLNESS COULD NOT BE CURED WITHOUT A LIVER TAKEN FROM A LIVE FOX SO TO REPAY YOUR KINDNESS I KILLED MY CUB AND TOOK OUT ITS LIVER THEN ITS SIRE DISGUISING HIMSELF AS A MESSENGER
7794-295947-0027 BROUGHT IT TO YOUR HOUSE AND AS SHE SPOKE THE FOX SHED TEARS AND THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WISHING TO THANK HER MOVED IN BED UPON WHICH HIS WIFE AWOKE AND ASKED HIM WHAT WAS THE MATTER BUT HE TOO TO HER GREAT ASTONISHMENT
7794-295947-0028 WAS BITING THE PILLOW AND WEEPING BITTERLY WHY ARE YOU WEEPING THUS ASKED SHE AT LAST HE SAT UP IN BED AND SAID LAST SPRING WHEN I WAS OUT ON A PLEASURE EXCURSION I WAS THE MEANS OF SAVING THE LIFE OF A FOX'S CUB
7794-295947-0029 AS I TOLD YOU AT THE TIME THE OTHER DAY I TOLD MISTER SO AND SO THAT ALTHOUGH MY SON WERE TO DIE BEFORE MY EYES I WOULD NOT BE THE MEANS OF KILLING A FOX ON PURPOSE BUT ASKED HIM IN CASE HE HEARD OF ANY HUNTER KILLING A FOX
7794-295947-0030 TO BUY IT FOR ME HOW THE FOXES CAME TO HEAR OF THIS I DON'T KNOW BUT THE FOXES TO WHOM I HAD SHOWN KINDNESS KILLED THEIR OWN CUB AND TOOK OUT THE LIVER AND THE OLD DOG FOX DISGUISING HIMSELF AS A MESSENGER FROM THE PERSON TO WHOM
7794-295947-0031 WE HAD CONFIDED THE COMMISSION CAME HERE WITH IT HIS MATE HAS JUST BEEN AT MY PILLOW SIDE AND TOLD ME ALL ABOUT IT HENCE IT WAS THAT IN SPITE OF MYSELF I WAS MOVED TO TEARS
7794-295947-0032 WHEN SHE HEARD THIS THE GOODWIFE LIKEWISE WAS BLINDED BY HER TEARS AND FOR A WHILE THEY LAY LOST IN THOUGHT BUT AT LAST COMING TO THEMSELVES THEY LIGHTED THE LAMP ON THE SHELF ON WHICH THE FAMILY IDOL STOOD
7794-295947-0033 AND SPENT THE NIGHT IN RECITING PRAYERS AND PRAISES AND THE NEXT DAY THEY PUBLISHED THE MATTER TO THE HOUSEHOLD AND TO THEIR RELATIONS AND FRIENDS NOW ALTHOUGH THERE ARE INSTANCES OF MEN KILLING THEIR OWN CHILDREN TO REQUITE A FAVOUR
7794-295947-0034 THERE IS NO OTHER EXAMPLE OF FOXES HAVING DONE SUCH A THING SO THE STORY BECAME THE TALK OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY NOW THE BOY WHO HAD RECOVERED THROUGH THE EFFICACY OF THIS MEDICINE SELECTED THE PRETTIEST SPOT ON THE PREMISES
7794-295947-0035 THE SAINTS WHO ARE WORSHIPPED IN JAPAN WRITES A NATIVE AUTHORITY ARE MEN WHO IN THE REMOTE AGES WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS DEVELOPING ITSELF WERE SAGES AND BY THEIR GREAT AND VIRTUOUS DEEDS HAVING EARNED THE GRATITUDE OF FUTURE GENERATIONS
7794-295947-0036 ALL MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE SHRINES OF THE SHINTO OR INDIGENOUS RELIGION ARE CONFIDED TO THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF THE FAMILIES OF YOSHIDA AND FUSHIMI
7794-295947-0037 THE AFFAIRS OF THE BUDDHIST OR IMPORTED RELIGION ARE UNDER THE CARE OF THE FAMILY OF KANJUJI AS IT IS NECESSARY THAT THOSE WHO AS PRIESTS PERFORM THE HONOURABLE OFFICE OF SERVING THE GODS SHOULD BE PERSONS OF SOME STANDING
7794-295947-0038 A CERTAIN SMALL RANK IS PROCURED FOR THEM THROUGH THE INTERVENTION OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ABOVE NOBLE FAMILIES WHO ON THE ISSUING OF THE REQUIRED PATENT RECEIVE AS THEIR PERQUISITE A FEE WHICH ALTHOUGH INSIGNIFICANT IN ITSELF
7794-295947-0039 WHOSE PENNILESS CONDITION FORMS A GREAT CONTRAST TO THE WEALTH OF THEIR INFERIORS IN RANK THE DAIMIOS I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE ONLY CASE IN WHICH RANK CAN BE BOUGHT OR SOLD IN JAPAN
7794-295947-0040 IN CHINA ON THE CONTRARY IN SPITE OF WHAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY MEADOWS AND OTHER ADMIRERS OF THE EXAMINATION SYSTEM A MAN CAN BE WHAT HE PLEASES BY PAYING FOR IT
7794-295947-0041 ARE LOCALLY WORSHIPPED TOUCHING THE REMEDY OF THE FOX'S LIVER PRESCRIBED IN THE TALE I MAY ADD THAT THERE WOULD BE NOTHING STRANGE IN THIS TO A PERSON ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHINESE PHARMACOPOEIA WHICH THE JAPANESE LONG EXCLUSIVELY FOLLOWED
7794-295947-0042 ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOW SUCCESSFULLY STUDYING THE ART OF HEALING AS PRACTISED IN THE WEST WHEN I WAS AT PEKING I SAW A CHINESE PHYSICIAN PRESCRIBE A DECOCTION OF THREE SCORPIONS FOR A CHILD STRUCK DOWN WITH FEVER
7794-295947-0043 AND ON ANOTHER OCCASION A GROOM OF MINE SUFFERING FROM DYSENTERY WAS TREATED WITH ACUPUNCTURE OF THE TONGUE THE ART OF MEDICINE WOULD APPEAR TO BE AT THE PRESENT TIME IN CHINA MUCH IN THE STATE IN WHICH IT EXISTED IN EUROPE IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
7794-295947-0044 FOR RETENTION CAUSED BY EITHER RENAL OR VESICAL CALCULI BUT I HAVE MYSELF THOROUGHLY EXPERIENCED THE UTILITY OF AN OIL I MAKE MYSELF WHEREOF SCORPIONS FORM A VERY LARGE PORTION OF THE INGREDIENTS
7794-295947-0045 IF ONLY THE REGION OF THE HEART AND ALL THE PULSES OF THE BODY BE ANOINTED WITH IT IT WILL FREE THE PATIENTS FROM THE EFFECTS OF ALL KINDS OF POISONS TAKEN BY THE MOUTH CORROSIVE ONES EXCEPTED DECOCTIONS OF EGYPTIAN MUMMIES WERE MUCH COMMENDED
7794-295947-0046 AND OFTEN PRESCRIBED WITH DUE ACADEMICAL SOLEMNITY AND THE BONES OF THE HUMAN SKULL PULVERIZED AND ADMINISTERED WITH OIL WERE USED AS A SPECIFIC IN CASES OF RENAL CALCULUS SEE PETRI ANDREAE MATTHIOLI OPERA FIFTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
7794-295948-0000 NIGHT AND MORNING HE RECITED THE PRAYER
7794-295948-0001 ALTHOUGH THE FAME OF HIS VIRTUE DID NOT REACH FAR YET HIS NEIGHBOURS RESPECTED AND REVERED HIM
7794-295948-0002 AND WHEN HIS ROOF OR HIS WALLS FELL OUT OF REPAIR THEY WOULD MEND THEM FOR HIM SO FOR THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD HE TOOK NO THOUGHT ONE VERY COLD NIGHT WHEN HE LITTLE THOUGHT ANY ONE WAS OUTSIDE HE HEARD A VOICE CALLING
7794-295948-0003 YOUR REVERENCE YOUR REVERENCE SO HE ROSE AND WENT OUT TO SEE WHO IT WAS AND THERE HE BEHELD AN OLD BADGER STANDING ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN GREATLY ALARMED AT THE APPARITION
7794-295948-0004 BUT NOW I AM GROWING OLD AND THIS SEVERE COLD IS MORE THAN I CAN BEAR I PRAY YOU TO LET ME ENTER AND WARM MYSELF AT THE FIRE OF YOUR COTTAGE THAT I MAY LIVE THROUGH THIS BITTER NIGHT
7794-295948-0005 WENT INTO THE HUT AND SQUATTING DOWN BY THE FIRE BEGAN TO WARM ITSELF AND THE PRIEST WITH RENEWED FERVOUR RECITED HIS PRAYERS AND STRUCK HIS BELL BEFORE THE IMAGE OF BUDDHA LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM
7794-295948-0006 AFTER TWO HOURS THE BADGER TOOK ITS LEAVE WITH PROFUSE EXPRESSIONS OF THANKS AND WENT OUT AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH IT CAME EVERY NIGHT TO THE HUT AS THE BADGER WOULD COLLECT AND BRING WITH IT DRIED BRANCHES AND DEAD LEAVES FROM THE HILLS FOR FIREWOOD
7794-295948-0007 THE PRIEST AT LAST BECAME VERY FRIENDLY WITH IT AND GOT USED TO ITS COMPANY SO THAT IF EVER AS THE NIGHT WORE ON THE BADGER DID NOT ARRIVE HE USED TO MISS IT AND WONDER WHY IT DID NOT COME
7794-295948-0008 AND EVEN AFTER MY DEATH I MUST REMEMBER THEM WHAT CAN I DO TO REQUITE THEM IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH FOR PRAY TELL ME THE PRIEST SMILING AT THIS SPEECH ANSWERED
7794-295948-0009 BEING SUCH AS I AM I HAVE NO DESIRE AND NO WISHES GLAD AS I AM TO HEAR YOUR KIND INTENTIONS THERE IS NOTHING THAT I CAN ASK YOU TO DO FOR ME YOU NEED FEEL NO ANXIETY ON MY ACCOUNT AS LONG AS I LIVE WHEN THE WINTER COMES
7794-295948-0010 YOU SHALL BE WELCOME HERE THE BADGER ON HEARING THIS COULD NOT CONCEAL ITS ADMIRATION OF THE DEPTH OF THE OLD MAN'S BENEVOLENCE BUT HAVING SO MUCH TO BE GRATEFUL FOR IT FELT HURT AT NOT BEING ABLE TO REQUITE IT
7794-295948-0011 AS THIS SUBJECT WAS OFTEN RENEWED BETWEEN THEM THE PRIEST AT LAST TOUCHED BY THE GOODNESS OF THE BADGER'S HEART SAID SINCE I HAVE SHAVEN MY HEAD RENOUNCED THE WORLD AND FORSAKEN THE PLEASURES OF THIS LIFE I HAVE NO DESIRE TO GRATIFY
7794-295948-0012 YET I OWN I SHOULD LIKE TO POSSESS THREE RIYOS IN GOLD FOOD AND RAIMENT I RECEIVE BY THE FAVOUR OF THE VILLAGERS SO I TAKE NO HEED FOR THOSE THINGS WERE I TO DIE TO MORROW AND ATTAIN MY WISH OF BEING BORN AGAIN INTO THE NEXT WORLD
7794-295948-0013 THE SAME KIND FOLK HAVE PROMISED TO MEET AND BURY MY BODY THUS ALTHOUGH I HAVE NO OTHER REASON TO WISH FOR MONEY STILL IF I HAD THREE RIYOS I WOULD OFFER THEM UP AT SOME HOLY SHRINE THAT MASSES AND PRAYERS MIGHT BE SAID FOR ME
7794-295948-0014 WHEREBY I MIGHT ENTER INTO SALVATION YET I WOULD NOT GET THIS MONEY BY VIOLENT OR UNLAWFUL MEANS I ONLY THINK OF WHAT MIGHT BE IF I HAD IT SO YOU SEE SINCE YOU HAVE EXPRESSED SUCH KIND FEELINGS TOWARD ME
7794-295948-0015 I HAVE TOLD YOU WHAT IS ON MY MIND WHEN THE PRIEST HAD DONE SPEAKING THE BADGER LEANT ITS HEAD ON ONE SIDE WITH A PUZZLED AND ANXIOUS LOOK SO MUCH SO THAT THE OLD MAN WAS SORRY HE HAD EXPRESSED A WISH WHICH SEEMED TO GIVE THE BEAST TROUBLE
7794-295948-0016 AND TRIED TO RETRACT WHAT HE HAD SAID POSTHUMOUS HONOURS AFTER ALL ARE THE WISH OF ORDINARY MEN I WHO AM A PRIEST OUGHT NOT TO ENTERTAIN SUCH THOUGHTS OR TO WANT MONEY SO PRAY PAY NO ATTENTION TO WHAT I HAVE SAID
7794-295948-0017 AND THE BADGER FEIGNING ASSENT TO WHAT THE PRIEST HAD IMPRESSED UPON IT RETURNED TO THE HILLS AS USUAL FROM THAT TIME FORTH THE BADGER CAME NO MORE TO THE HUT
7794-295948-0018 THE PRIEST THOUGHT THIS VERY STRANGE BUT IMAGINED EITHER THAT THE BADGER STAYED AWAY BECAUSE IT DID NOT LIKE TO COME WITHOUT THE MONEY OR THAT IT HAD BEEN KILLED IN AN ATTEMPT TO STEAL IT AND HE BLAMED HIMSELF FOR HAVING ADDED TO HIS SINS FOR NO PURPOSE
7794-295948-0019 REPENTING WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE PERSUADED HOWEVER THAT THE BADGER MUST HAVE BEEN KILLED HE PASSED HIS TIME IN PUTTING UP PRAYERS UPON PRAYERS FOR IT AFTER THREE YEARS HAD GONE BY ONE NIGHT
7794-295948-0020 THE OLD MAN HEARD A VOICE NEAR HIS DOOR CALLING OUT YOUR REVERENCE YOUR REVERENCE AS THE VOICE WAS LIKE THAT OF THE BADGER HE JUMPED UP AS SOON AS HE HEARD IT AND RAN TO OPEN THE DOOR AND THERE SURE ENOUGH WAS THE BADGER
7794-295948-0021 IF THE MONEY WHICH YOU REQUIRED HAD BEEN FOR UNLAWFUL PURPOSES I COULD EASILY HAVE PROCURED AS MUCH AS EVER YOU MIGHT HAVE WANTED BUT WHEN I HEARD THAT IT WAS TO BE OFFERED TO A TEMPLE FOR MASSES FOR YOUR SOUL
7794-295948-0022 FUSED IT AFRESH IN THE FIRE AND AT THIS WORK I SPENT MONTHS AND DAYS AS THE BADGER FINISHED SPEAKING THE PRIEST LOOKED AT THE MONEY WHICH IT HAD PRODUCED AND SURE ENOUGH HE SAW THAT IT WAS BRIGHT AND NEW AND CLEAN
7794-295948-0023 AS HE WAS THANKING THE BADGER WITH GREAT POLITENESS AND CEREMONY THE BEAST SAID IN DOING THIS I HAVE BUT FULFILLED MY OWN WISH STILL I HOPE THAT YOU WILL TELL THIS THING TO NO MAN INDEED REPLIED THE PRIEST
7794-295948-0024 BUT I SHALL SAY THAT THE BADGER THAT GAVE ME THE MONEY HAS CEASED COMING TO MY HUT YOU NEED NOT FEAR BEING WAYLAID BUT CAN COME AS OF OLD AND SHELTER YOURSELF FROM THE COLD TO THIS THE BADGER NODDED ASSENT AND AS LONG AS THE OLD PRIEST LIVED
7794-295948-0025 IT CAME AND SPENT THE WINTER NIGHTS WITH HIM FROM THIS STORY IT IS PLAIN THAT EVEN BEASTS HAVE A SENSE OF GRATITUDE IN THIS QUALITY DOGS EXCEL ALL OTHER BEASTS
7794-295948-0026 WRITTEN IN THE ANNALS OF JAPAN
7794-295955-0000 THEN THE MIDDLE SON WENT HUNTING AND AS HE ISSUED FROM THE TOWN A HARE SPRANG OUT OF A BUSH AND THE PRINCE AFTER IT AND HITHER AND THITHER TILL THE HARE FLED INTO THE WATER MILL AND THE PRINCE AFTER IT
7794-295955-0001 BUT IT WAS NOT A HARE BUT A DRAGON WHICH WAITED FOR AND DEVOURED HIM WHEN SOME DAYS HAD ELAPSED AND THE PRINCES DID NOT RETURN EITHER OF THEM THE WHOLE COURT WAS IN SORROW
7794-295955-0002 THEN THE THIRD SON WENT HUNTING TO SEE WHETHER HE COULD NOT FIND HIS BROTHERS WHEN HE ISSUED FROM THE TOWN AGAIN UP SPRANG A HARE OUT OF A BUSH AND THE PRINCE AFTER IT AND HITHER AND THITHER TILL THE HARE FLED INTO THE WATER MILL
7794-295955-0003 BUT THE PRINCE DID NOT CHOOSE TO FOLLOW IT BUT WENT TO FIND OTHER GAME SAYING TO HIMSELF WHEN I RETURN I SHALL FIND YOU AFTER THUS HE WENT FOR A LONG TIME UP AND DOWN THE HILL BUT FOUND NOTHING AND THEN RETURNED TO THE WATER MILL
7794-295955-0004 SHE REPLIED MY SON THAT WAS NOT A HARE BUT A DRAGON IT KILLS AND THROTTLES MANY PEOPLE HEARING THIS THE PRINCE WAS SOMEWHAT DISTURBED AND SAID TO THE OLD WOMAN WHAT SHALL WE DO NOW DOUBTLESS MY TWO BROTHERS ALSO HAVE PERISHED HERE
7794-295955-0005 THE OLD WOMAN ANSWERED THEY HAVE INDEED BUT THERE'S NO HELP FOR IT GO HOME MY SON LEST YOU FOLLOW THEM THEN HE SAID TO HER DEAR OLD WOMAN DO YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW THAT YOU WILL BE GLAD TO LIBERATE YOURSELF FROM THAT PEST
7794-295955-0006 THE OLD WOMAN INTERRUPTED HIM HOW SHOULD I NOT IT CAPTURED ME TOO IN THIS WAY BUT NOW I HAVE NO MEANS OF ESCAPE THEN HE PROCEEDED LISTEN WELL TO WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY TO YOU ASK IT WHITHER IT GOES AND WHERE ITS STRENGTH IS
7794-295955-0007 WHEN THE DRAGON CAME IN THE OLD WOMAN BEGAN TO QUESTION IT WHERE IN GOD'S NAME HAVE YOU BEEN WHITHER DO YOU GO SO FAR YOU WILL NEVER TELL ME WHITHER YOU GO THE DRAGON REPLIED WELL MY DEAR OLD WOMAN I DO GO FAR
7794-295955-0008 MY STRENGTH IS A LONG WAY OFF AND YOU CANNOT GO THITHER FAR IN ANOTHER EMPIRE UNDER THE EMPEROR'S CITY IS A LAKE IN THAT LAKE IS A DRAGON AND IN THAT DRAGON A BOAR AND IN THE BOAR A PIGEON AND IN THAT IS MY STRENGTH
7794-295955-0009 TOOK A SHEPHERD'S STAFF IN HIS HAND AND WENT INTO THE WORLD AS HE WENT ON THUS FROM VILLAGE TO VILLAGE AND FROM TOWN TO TOWN AT LAST HE CAME INTO ANOTHER EMPIRE AND INTO THE IMPERIAL CITY IN A LAKE UNDER WHICH THE DRAGON WAS
7794-295955-0010 ON GOING INTO THE TOWN HE BEGAN TO INQUIRE WHO WANTED A SHEPHERD THE CITIZENS TOLD HIM THAT THE EMPEROR DID THEN HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE EMPEROR AFTER HE ANNOUNCED HIMSELF THE EMPEROR ADMITTED HIM INTO HIS PRESENCE AND ASKED HIM
7794-295955-0011 AND WHEN YOU CALL THE SHEEP OUT THEY GO THITHER AT ONCE AND SPREAD THEMSELVES ROUND THE LAKE BUT WHATEVER SHEPHERD GOES OFF THERE THAT SHEPHERD RETURNS BACK NO MORE THEREFORE MY SON I TELL YOU
7794-295955-0012 DON'T LET THE SHEEP HAVE THEIR OWN WAY AND GO WHERE THEY WILL BUT KEEP THEM WHERE YOU WILL THE PRINCE THANKED THE EMPEROR GOT HIMSELF READY AND CALLED OUT THE SHEEP TAKING WITH HIM MORE OVER TWO HOUNDS THAT COULD CATCH A BOAR IN THE OPEN COUNTRY
7794-295955-0013 AND THE HOUNDS AND BAGPIPES UNDER THE STUMP THEN TUCKED UP HIS HOSE AND SLEEVES WADED INTO THE LAKE AND BEGAN TO SHOUT DRAGON DRAGON COME OUT TO SINGLE COMBAT WITH ME TO DAY
7794-295955-0014 LET ME GO PRINCE THAT I MAY MOISTEN MY PARCHED HEAD IN THE LAKE AND TOSS YOU TO THE SKY BUT THE PRINCE REPLIED COME DRAGON DON'T TALK NONSENSE IF I HAD THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER TO KISS ME ON THE FOREHEAD I WOULD TOSS YOU STILL HIGHER
7794-295955-0015 BECAUSE HE HAD COME WHEREAS PREVIOUSLY NO SHEPHERD HAD BEEN ABLE TO COME FROM THE LAKE THE NEXT DAY THE PRINCE GOT READY AGAIN AND WENT WITH HIS SHEEP STRAIGHT TO THE LAKE BUT THE EMPEROR SENT TWO GROOMS AFTER HIM TO GO STEALTHILY AND SEE WHAT HE DID
7794-295955-0016 AND THEY PLACED THEMSELVES ON A HIGH HILL WHENCE THEY COULD HAVE A GOOD VIEW WHEN THE SHEPHERD ARRIVED HE PUT THE HOUNDS AND BAGPIPES UNDER THE STUMP AND THE FALCON UPON IT THEN TUCKED UP HIS HOSE AND SLEEVES WADED INTO THE LAKE AND SHOUTED DRAGON DRAGON
7794-295955-0017 COME OUT TO SINGLE COMBAT WITH ME THAT WE MAY MEASURE OURSELVES ONCE MORE TOGETHER UNLESS YOU ARE A WOMAN THE DRAGON REPLIED I WILL DO SO PRINCE NOW NOW ERELONG BEHOLD THE DRAGON IT WAS LARGE IT WAS TERRIBLE
7794-295955-0018 IT WAS DISGUSTING AND IT SEIZED HIM BY THE WAIST AND WRESTLED WITH HIM A SUMMER'S DAY TILL AFTERNOON BUT WHEN THE AFTERNOON HEAT CAME ON THE DRAGON SAID LET ME GO PRINCE THAT I MAY MOISTEN MY PARCHED HEAD IN THE LAKE AND MAY TOSS YOU TO THE SKY
7794-295955-0019 WHEN NIGHT APPROACHED THE PRINCE DROVE THE SHEEP AS BEFORE AND WENT HOME PLAYING THE BAGPIPES WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE TOWN THE WHOLE TOWN WAS ASTIR AND BEGAN TO WONDER BECAUSE THE SHEPHERD CAME HOME EVERY EVENING WHICH NO ONE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO BEFORE
7794-295955-0020 THOSE TWO GROOMS HAD ALREADY ARRIVED AT THE PALACE BEFORE THE PRINCE AND RELATED TO THE EMPEROR IN ORDER EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAD HEARD AND SEEN NOW WHEN THE EMPEROR SAW THAT THE SHEPHERD RETURNED HOME HE IMMEDIATELY SUMMONED HIS DAUGHTER INTO HIS PRESENCE AND TOLD HER ALL
7794-295955-0021 AND I AM YOUR ONLY DAUGHTER AND YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME IF I PERISH THEN THE EMPEROR BEGAN TO PERSUADE AND ENCOURAGE HER DON'T FEAR MY DAUGHTER YOU SEE WE HAVE HAD SO MANY CHANGES OF SHEPHERDS AND OF ALL THAT WENT OUT TO THE LAKE NOT ONE HAS RETURNED
7794-295955-0022 SO MANY PEOPLE WHEN ON THE MORROW THE DAY DAWNED AND THE SUN CAME FORTH UP ROSE THE SHEPHERD UP ROSE THE MAIDEN TOO TO BEGIN TO PREPARE FOR GOING TO THE LAKE THE SHEPHERD WAS CHEERFUL MORE CHEERFUL THAN EVER
7794-295955-0023 BUT THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER WAS SAD AND SHED TEARS THE SHEPHERD COMFORTED HER LADY SISTER I PRAY YOU DO NOT WEEP BUT DO WHAT I TELL YOU WHEN IT IS TIME RUN UP AND KISS ME AND FEAR NOT AS HE WENT AND DROVE THE SHEEP
7794-295955-0024 WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE LAKE THE SHEEP IMMEDIATELY SPREAD ROUND IT AND THE PRINCE PLACED THE FALCON ON THE STUMP AND THE HOUNDS AND BAGPIPES UNDER IT THEN TUCKED UP HIS HOSE AND SLEEVES WADED INTO THE WATER AND SHOUTED DRAGON DRAGON
7794-295955-0025 THE PRINCE REPLIED COME DRAGON DON'T TALK NONSENSE IF I HAD THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER TO KISS ME ON THE FOREHEAD I WOULD TOSS YOU MUCH HIGHER WHEN HE SAID THIS THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER RAN UP AND KISSED HIM ON THE FACE ON THE EYE AND ON THE FOREHEAD
7794-295955-0026 THEN HE SWUNG THE DRAGON AND TOSSED IT HIGH INTO THE AIR AND WHEN IT FELL TO THE GROUND IT BURST INTO PIECES BUT AS IT BURST INTO PIECES OUT OF IT SPRANG A WILD BOAR AND STARTED TO RUN AWAY BUT THE PRINCE SHOUTED TO HIS SHEPHERD DOGS
7794-295955-0027 HOLD IT DON'T LET IT GO AND THE DOGS SPRANG UP AND AFTER IT CAUGHT IT AND SOON TORE IT TO PIECES BUT OUT OF THE BOAR FLEW A PIGEON AND THE PRINCE LOOSED THE FALCON AND THE FALCON CAUGHT THE PIGEON
7794-295955-0028 CUT THESE THREE WANDS UP FROM BELOW AND STRIKE WITH THEM UPON THEIR ROOT AN IRON DOOR WILL IMMEDIATELY OPEN INTO A LARGE VAULT IN THAT VAULT ARE MANY PEOPLE OLD AND YOUNG RICH AND POOR SMALL AND GREAT WIVES AND MAIDENS
7794-295955-0029 SO THAT YOU COULD SETTLE A POPULOUS EMPIRE THERE TOO ARE YOUR BROTHERS WHEN THE PIGEON HAD TOLD HIM ALL THIS THE PRINCE IMMEDIATELY WRUNG ITS NECK THE EMPEROR HAD GONE OUT IN PERSON
7794-295955-0030 HE WASHED HIMSELF NICELY TOOK THE FALCON ON HIS SHOULDER THE HOUNDS BEHIND HIM AND THE BAGPIPES UNDER HIS ARM PLAYED AS HE WENT DROVE THE SHEEP
7794-295955-0031 WHEN THEY CAME TO THE TOWN ALL THE TOWN ASSEMBLED AS TO SEE A WONDER THE EMPEROR WHO HAD SEEN ALL HIS HEROISM FROM THE HILL CALLED HIM INTO HIS PRESENCE AND GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER WENT IMMEDIATELY TO CHURCH HAD THEM MARRIED AND HELD A WEDDING FESTIVAL FOR A WEEK
78-368-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK WHEN WE LANDED WE WALKED FOR A SHORT TIME ON THE SHORE ENJOYING THE TRANSITORY LIGHT AND THEN RETIRED TO THE INN
78-368-0001 THE WIND WHICH HAD FALLEN IN THE SOUTH NOW ROSE WITH GREAT VIOLENCE IN THE WEST THE MOON HAD REACHED HER SUMMIT IN THE HEAVENS AND WAS BEGINNING TO DESCEND
78-368-0002 THE CLOUDS SWEPT ACROSS IT SWIFTER THAN THE FLIGHT OF THE VULTURE AND DIMMED HER RAYS WHILE THE LAKE REFLECTED THE SCENE OF THE BUSY HEAVENS RENDERED STILL BUSIER BY THE RESTLESS WAVES
78-368-0003 THAT WERE BEGINNING TO RISE SUDDENLY A HEAVY STORM OF RAIN DESCENDED I HAD BEEN CALM DURING THE DAY BUT SO SOON AS NIGHT OBSCURED THE SHAPES OF OBJECTS
78-368-0004 AND NOT SHRINK FROM THE CONFLICT UNTIL MY OWN LIFE OR THAT OF MY ADVERSARY WAS EXTINGUISHED ELIZABETH OBSERVED MY AGITATION FOR SOME TIME IN TIMID AND FEARFUL SILENCE
78-368-0005 WHEN SUDDENLY I HEARD A SHRILL AND DREADFUL SCREAM IT CAME FROM THE ROOM INTO WHICH ELIZABETH HAD RETIRED AS I HEARD IT THE WHOLE TRUTH RUSHED INTO MY MIND MY ARMS DROPPED THE MOTION OF EVERY MUSCLE AND FIBRE WAS SUSPENDED
78-368-0006 I COULD FEEL THE BLOOD TRICKLING IN MY VEINS AND TINGLING IN THE EXTREMITIES OF MY LIMBS THIS STATE LASTED BUT FOR AN INSTANT
78-368-0007 GREAT GOD WHY DID I NOT THEN EXPIRE WHY AM I HERE TO RELATE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BEST HOPE
78-368-0008 SHE WAS THERE LIFELESS AND INANIMATE THROWN ACROSS THE BED HER HEAD HANGING DOWN AND HER PALE AND DISTORTED FEATURES HALF COVERED BY HER HAIR EVERYWHERE I TURN I SEE THE SAME FIGURE HER BLOODLESS ARMS AND RELAXED FORM
78-368-0009 FLUNG BY THE MURDERER ON ITS BRIDAL BIER COULD I BEHOLD THIS AND LIVE ALAS LIFE IS OBSTINATE AND CLINGS CLOSEST WHERE IT IS MOST HATED
78-368-0010 BUT THE HORROR OF OTHERS APPEARED ONLY AS A MOCKERY A SHADOW OF THE FEELINGS THAT OPPRESSED ME I ESCAPED FROM THEM
78-368-0011 TO THE ROOM WHERE LAY THE BODY OF ELIZABETH MY LOVE MY WIFE SO LATELY LIVING SO DEAR SO WORTHY SHE HAD BEEN MOVED FROM THE POSTURE IN WHICH I HAD FIRST BEHELD HER
78-368-0012 BUT THE DEADLY LANGUOR AND COLDNESS OF THE LIMBS TOLD ME THAT WHAT I NOW HELD IN MY ARMS HAD CEASED TO BE THE ELIZABETH WHOM I HAD LOVED AND CHERISHED THE MURDEROUS MARK OF THE FIEND'S GRASP WAS ON HER NECK
78-368-0013 AND I FELT A KIND OF PANIC ON SEEING THE PALE YELLOW LIGHT OF THE MOON ILLUMINATE THE CHAMBER THE SHUTTERS HAD BEEN THROWN BACK AND WITH A SENSATION OF HORROR NOT TO BE DESCRIBED
78-368-0014 I SAW AT THE OPEN WINDOW A FIGURE THE MOST HIDEOUS AND ABHORRED A GRIN WAS ON THE FACE OF THE MONSTER HE SEEMED TO JEER AS WITH HIS FIENDISH FINGER HE POINTED TOWARDS THE CORPSE OF MY WIFE
78-368-0015 BUT HE ELUDED ME LEAPED FROM HIS STATION AND RUNNING WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF LIGHTNING PLUNGED INTO THE LAKE THE REPORT OF THE PISTOL BROUGHT A CROWD INTO THE ROOM
78-368-0016 NETS WERE CAST BUT IN VAIN AFTER PASSING SEVERAL HOURS WE RETURNED HOPELESS
78-368-0017 AFTER HAVING LANDED THEY PROCEEDED TO SEARCH THE COUNTRY PARTIES GOING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AMONG THE WOODS AND VINES I ATTEMPTED TO ACCOMPANY THEM AND PROCEEDED A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE
78-368-0018 A FILM COVERED MY EYES AND MY SKIN WAS PARCHED WITH THE HEAT OF FEVER IN THIS STATE I WAS CARRIED BACK AND PLACED ON A BED HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED MY EYES WANDERED ROUND THE ROOM
78-368-0019 AS IF TO SEEK SOMETHING THAT I HAD LOST AFTER AN INTERVAL I AROSE AND AS IF BY INSTINCT CRAWLED INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE CORPSE OF MY BELOVED LAY THERE WERE WOMEN WEEPING AROUND I HUNG OVER IT
78-368-0020 AND JOINED MY SAD TEARS TO THEIRS ALL THIS TIME NO DISTINCT IDEA PRESENTED ITSELF TO MY MIND
78-368-0021 SUBJECTS REFLECTING CONFUSEDLY ON MY MISFORTUNES AND THEIR CAUSE I WAS BEWILDERED IN A CLOUD OF WONDER AND HORROR THE DEATH OF WILLIAM THE EXECUTION OF JUSTINE
78-368-0022 THE MURDER OF CLERVAL AND LASTLY OF MY WIFE EVEN AT THAT MOMENT I KNEW NOT THAT MY ONLY REMAINING FRIENDS WERE SAFE FROM THE MALIGNITY OF THE FIEND
78-368-0023 MY FATHER EVEN NOW MIGHT BE WRITHING UNDER HIS GRASP AND ERNEST MIGHT BE DEAD AT HIS FEET THIS IDEA MADE ME SHUDDER AND RECALLED ME TO ACTION
78-368-0024 THERE WERE NO HORSES TO BE PROCURED AND I MUST RETURN BY THE LAKE BUT THE WIND WAS UNFAVOURABLE AND THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS
78-368-0025 HOWEVER IT WAS HARDLY MORNING AND I MIGHT REASONABLY HOPE TO ARRIVE BY NIGHT
78-368-0026 BUT NOTHING COULD APPEAR TO ME AS IT HAD DONE THE DAY BEFORE A FIEND HAD SNATCHED FROM ME EVERY HOPE OF FUTURE HAPPINESS NO CREATURE HAD EVER BEEN SO MISERABLE AS I WAS SO FRIGHTFUL AN EVENT IS SINGLE IN THE HISTORY OF MAN
78-368-0027 BUT WHY SHOULD I DWELL UPON THE INCIDENTS THAT FOLLOWED THIS LAST OVERWHELMING EVENT MINE HAS BEEN A TALE OF HORRORS I HAVE REACHED THEIR ACME AND WHAT I MUST NOW RELATE
78-368-0028 KNOW THAT ONE BY ONE MY FRIENDS WERE SNATCHED AWAY I WAS LEFT DESOLATE MY OWN STRENGTH IS EXHAUSTED
78-368-0029 AND I MUST TELL IN A FEW WORDS WHAT REMAINS OF MY HIDEOUS NARRATION I ARRIVED AT GENEVA MY FATHER AND ERNEST YET LIVED BUT THE FORMER SUNK UNDER THE TIDINGS THAT I BORE
78-368-0030 MISERY ON HIS GREY HAIRS AND DOOMED HIM TO WASTE IN WRETCHEDNESS HE COULD NOT LIVE UNDER THE HORRORS THAT WERE ACCUMULATED AROUND HIM THE SPRINGS OF EXISTENCE SUDDENLY GAVE WAY
78-368-0031 SOMETIMES INDEED I DREAMT THAT I WANDERED
78-368-0032 MELANCHOLY FOLLOWED BUT BY DEGREES I GAINED A CLEAR CONCEPTION OF MY MISERIES AND SITUATION AND WAS THEN RELEASED FROM MY PRISON FOR THEY HAD CALLED ME MAD AND DURING MANY MONTHS AS I UNDERSTOOD A SOLITARY CELL HAD BEEN MY HABITATION
78-368-0033 THE MONSTER WHOM I HAD CREATED THE MISERABLE DAEMON WHOM I HAD SENT ABROAD INTO THE WORLD FOR MY DESTRUCTION I WAS POSSESSED BY A MADDENING RAGE WHEN I THOUGHT OF HIM
78-368-0034 AND DESIRED AND ARDENTLY PRAYED THAT I MIGHT HAVE HIM WITHIN MY GRASP TO WREAK A GREAT
78-368-0035 REVENGE ON HIS CURSED HEAD NOR DID MY HATE LONG CONFINE ITSELF TO USELESS WISHES I BEGAN TO REFLECT ON THE BEST MEANS OF SECURING HIM AND FOR THIS PURPOSE
78-368-0036 AND TOLD HIM THAT I HAD AN ACCUSATION TO MAKE THAT I KNEW THE DESTROYER OF MY FAMILY AND THAT I REQUIRED HIM TO EXERT HIS WHOLE AUTHORITY FOR THE APPREHENSION OF THE MURDERER
78-368-0037 HOWEVER WONDERFUL FORCES CONVICTION THE STORY IS TOO CONNECTED TO BE MISTAKEN FOR A DREAM AND I HAVE NO MOTIVE FOR FALSEHOOD
78-368-0038 MY MANNER AS I THUS ADDRESSED HIM WAS IMPRESSIVE
78-368-0039 AND THIS PURPOSE QUIETED MY AGONY AND FOR AN INTERVAL RECONCILED ME TO LIFE I NOW RELATED MY HISTORY BRIEFLY BUT WITH FIRMNESS AND PRECISION MARKING THE DATES WITH ACCURACY
78-368-0040 AND NEVER DEVIATING INTO INVECTIVE OR EXCLAMATION THE MAGISTRATE APPEARED AT FIRST PERFECTLY INCREDULOUS BUT AS I CONTINUED HE BECAME MORE ATTENTIVE AND INTERESTED
78-368-0041 WHEN I HAD CONCLUDED MY NARRATION I SAID THIS IS THE BEING WHOM I ACCUSE AND FOR WHOSE SEIZURE AND PUNISHMENT I CALL UPON YOU TO EXERT YOUR WHOLE POWER
78-368-0042 FROM THE EXECUTION OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON THIS OCCASION
78-368-0043 I WOULD WILLINGLY AFFORD YOU EVERY AID IN YOUR PURSUIT BUT THE CREATURE OF WHOM YOU SPEAK APPEARS TO HAVE POWERS WHICH WOULD PUT ALL MY EXERTIONS TO DEFIANCE
78-368-0044 WHO CAN FOLLOW AN ANIMAL WHICH CAN TRAVERSE THE SEA OF ICE AND INHABIT CAVES AND DENS WHERE NO MAN WOULD VENTURE TO INTRUDE
78-368-0045 SINCE THE COMMISSION OF HIS CRIMES AND NO ONE CAN CONJECTURE TO WHAT PLACE HE HAS WANDERED OR WHAT REGION HE MAY NOW INHABIT I DO NOT DOUBT THAT HE HOVERS NEAR THE SPOT WHICH I INHABIT
78-368-0046 AND IF HE HAS INDEED TAKEN REFUGE IN THE ALPS HE MAY BE HUNTED LIKE THE CHAMOIS AND DESTROYED AS A BEAST OF PREY BUT I PERCEIVE YOUR THOUGHTS YOU DO NOT CREDIT MY NARRATIVE
78-368-0047 AND DO NOT INTEND TO PURSUE MY ENEMY WITH THE PUNISHMENT WHICH IS HIS DESERT AS I SPOKE RAGE SPARKLED IN MY EYES THE MAGISTRATE WAS INTIMIDATED YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID HE
78-368-0048 I WILL EXERT MYSELF AND IF IT IS IN MY POWER TO SEIZE THE MONSTER BE ASSURED THAT HE SHALL SUFFER PUNISHMENT PROPORTIONATE TO HIS CRIMES BUT I FEAR FROM WHAT YOU
78-368-0049 HAVE YOURSELF DESCRIBED TO BE HIS PROPERTIES THAT THIS WILL PROVE IMPRACTICABLE AND THUS WHILE EVERY PROPER MEASURE IS PURSUED YOU SHOULD MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO DISAPPOINTMENT THAT CANNOT BE
78-368-0050 BUT ALL THAT I CAN SAY WILL BE OF LITTLE AVAIL MY REVENGE IS OF NO MOMENT TO YOU YET WHILE I ALLOW IT TO BE A VICE
78-368-0051 MY RAGE IS UNSPEAKABLE WHEN I REFLECT THAT THE MURDERER WHOM I HAVE TURNED LOOSE UPON SOCIETY STILL EXISTS YOU REFUSE MY JUST DEMAND I HAVE BUT ONE RESOURCE AND I DEVOTE MYSELF EITHER IN MY LIFE OR DEATH TO HIS DESTRUCTION
78-368-0052 I TREMBLED WITH EXCESS OF AGITATION AS I SAID THIS THERE WAS A FRENZY IN MY MANNER AND SOMETHING I DOUBT NOT OF THAT HAUGHTY FIERCENESS WHICH THE MARTYRS OF OLD ARE SAID TO HAVE POSSESSED
78-368-0053 HOW IGNORANT ART THOU IN THY PRIDE OF WISDOM CEASE
78-369-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR MY PRESENT SITUATION WAS ONE IN WHICH ALL VOLUNTARY THOUGHT WAS SWALLOWED UP AND LOST I WAS HURRIED AWAY BY FURY
78-369-0001 MY FIRST RESOLUTION WAS TO QUIT GENEVA FOREVER MY COUNTRY WHICH WHEN I WAS HAPPY AND BELOVED WAS DEAR TO ME NOW IN MY ADVERSITY BECAME HATEFUL
78-369-0002 I PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A SUM OF MONEY TOGETHER WITH A FEW JEWELS WHICH HAD BELONGED TO MY MOTHER AND DEPARTED AND NOW MY WANDERINGS BEGAN WHICH ARE TO CEASE BUT WITH LIFE
78-369-0003 ALL THE HARDSHIPS WHICH TRAVELLERS IN DESERTS AND BARBAROUS COUNTRIES ARE WONT TO MEET HOW I HAVE LIVED I HARDLY KNOW
78-369-0004 AND PRAYED FOR DEATH BUT REVENGE KEPT ME ALIVE I DARED NOT DIE AND LEAVE MY ADVERSARY IN BEING WHEN I QUITTED GENEVA MY FIRST LABOUR
78-369-0005 UNCERTAIN WHAT PATH I SHOULD PURSUE AS NIGHT APPROACHED I FOUND MYSELF AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CEMETERY WHERE WILLIAM ELIZABETH AND MY FATHER REPOSED I ENTERED IT
78-369-0006 AND APPROACHED THE TOMB WHICH MARKED THEIR GRAVES EVERYTHING WAS SILENT EXCEPT THE LEAVES OF THE TREES WHICH WERE GENTLY AGITATED BY THE WIND THE NIGHT WAS NEARLY DARK AND THE SCENE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOLEMN
78-369-0007 AND AFFECTING EVEN TO AN UNINTERESTED OBSERVER THE SPIRITS OF THE DEPARTED SEEMED TO FLIT AROUND
78-369-0008 THEIR MURDERER ALSO LIVED AND TO DESTROY HIM I MUST DRAG OUT MY WEARY EXISTENCE I KNELT ON THE GRASS AND KISSED THE EARTH AND WITH QUIVERING LIPS EXCLAIMED BY THE SACRED EARTH
78-369-0009 ON WHICH I KNEEL BY THE SHADES THAT WANDER NEAR ME BY THE DEEP AND ETERNAL GRIEF THAT I FEEL I SWEAR AND BY THEE O NIGHT AND THE SPIRITS THAT PRESIDE OVER THEE TO PURSUE THE DAEMON
78-369-0010 WHICH OTHERWISE SHOULD VANISH FROM MY EYES FOREVER AND I CALL ON YOU SPIRITS OF THE DEAD AND ON YOU WANDERING MINISTERS OF VENGEANCE TO AID AND CONDUCT ME IN MY WORK
78-369-0011 DEEP OF AGONY LET HIM FEEL THE DESPAIR THAT NOW TORMENTS ME I HAD BEGUN MY ADJURATION WITH SOLEMNITY AND AN AWE WHICH ALMOST ASSURED ME THAT THE SHADES OF MY MURDERED FRIENDS
78-369-0012 HEARD AND APPROVED MY DEVOTION BUT THE FURIES POSSESSED ME AS I CONCLUDED AND RAGE CHOKED MY UTTERANCE
78-369-0013 IT RANG ON MY EARS LONG AND HEAVILY THE MOUNTAINS RE ECHOED IT AND I FELT AS IF ALL HELL SURROUNDED ME WITH MOCKERY AND LAUGHTER
78-369-0014 AND THAT I WAS RESERVED FOR VENGEANCE THE LAUGHTER DIED AWAY WHEN A WELL KNOWN AND ABHORRED VOICE APPARENTLY CLOSE TO MY EAR
78-369-0015 I AM SATISFIED MISERABLE WRETCH YOU HAVE DETERMINED TO LIVE AND I AM SATISFIED I DARTED TOWARDS THE SPOT FROM WHICH THE SOUND PROCEEDED BUT THE DEVIL ELUDED MY GRASP
78-369-0016 SUDDENLY THE BROAD DISK OF THE MOON AROSE AND SHONE FULL UPON HIS GHASTLY AND DISTORTED SHAPE AS HE FLED WITH MORE THAN MORTAL SPEED I PURSUED HIM AND FOR MANY MONTHS THIS HAS BEEN MY TASK
78-369-0017 SCARED BY THIS HORRID APPARITION INFORMED ME OF HIS PATH SOMETIMES HE HIMSELF WHO FEARED THAT IF I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM I SHOULD DESPAIR AND DIE LEFT SOME MARK TO GUIDE ME
78-369-0018 THE SNOWS DESCENDED ON MY HEAD AND I SAW THE PRINT OF HIS HUGE STEP ON THE WHITE PLAIN TO YOU FIRST ENTERING ON LIFE TO WHOM CARE IS NEW AND AGONY UNKNOWN
78-369-0019 WOULD SUDDENLY EXTRICATE ME FROM SEEMINGLY INSURMOUNTABLE DIFFICULTIES SOMETIMES WHEN NATURE OVERCOME BY HUNGER SANK UNDER THE EXHAUSTION A REPAST WAS PREPARED FOR ME IN THE DESERT
78-369-0020 THAT RESTORED AND INSPIRITED ME THE FARE WAS INDEED COARSE SUCH AS THE PEASANTS OF THE COUNTRY ATE
78-369-0021 AND VANISH I FOLLOWED WHEN I COULD THE COURSES OF THE RIVERS BUT THE DAEMON GENERALLY AVOIDED THESE AS IT WAS HERE THAT THE POPULATION OF THE COUNTRY CHIEFLY COLLECTED
78-369-0022 I ALWAYS PRESENTED TO THOSE WHO HAD PROVIDED ME WITH FIRE AND UTENSILS FOR COOKING MY LIFE AS IT PASSED THUS WAS INDEED HATEFUL TO ME AND IT WAS DURING SLEEP ALONE THAT I COULD TASTE JOY O BLESSED SLEEP
78-369-0023 OFTEN WHEN MOST MISERABLE I SANK TO REPOSE AND MY DREAMS LULLED ME EVEN TO RAPTURE THE SPIRITS THAT GUARDED ME HAD PROVIDED THESE MOMENTS OR RATHER HOURS OF HAPPINESS THAT I MIGHT RETAIN STRENGTH TO FULFIL MY PILGRIMAGE
78-369-0024 DURING THE DAY I WAS SUSTAINED AND INSPIRITED BY THE HOPE OF NIGHT FOR IN SLEEP I SAW MY FRIENDS MY WIFE AND MY BELOVED COUNTRY AGAIN I SAW THE BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE OF MY FATHER
78-369-0025 HEARD THE SILVER TONES OF MY ELIZABETH'S VOICE AND BEHELD CLERVAL ENJOYING HEALTH AND YOUTH OFTEN WHEN WEARIED BY A TOILSOME MARCH I PERSUADED MYSELF THAT I WAS DREAMING UNTIL NIGHT SHOULD COME
78-369-0026 AND THAT I SHOULD THEN ENJOY REALITY IN THE ARMS OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS WHAT AGONIZING FONDNESS DID I FEEL FOR THEM
78-369-0027 AND PERSUADE MYSELF THAT THEY STILL LIVED AT SUCH MOMENTS VENGEANCE THAT BURNED WITHIN ME DIED IN MY HEART AND I PURSUED MY PATH TOWARDS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE DAEMON MORE AS A TASK ENJOINED BY HEAVEN
78-369-0028 AS THE MECHANICAL IMPULSE OF SOME POWER OF WHICH I WAS UNCONSCIOUS THAN AS THE ARDENT DESIRE OF MY SOUL WHAT HIS FEELINGS WERE WHOM I PURSUED I CANNOT KNOW
78-369-0029 THESE WORDS WERE LEGIBLE IN ONE OF THESE INSCRIPTIONS YOU LIVE AND MY POWER IS COMPLETE FOLLOW ME I SEEK THE EVERLASTING ICES OF THE NORTH
78-369-0030 WHERE YOU WILL FEEL THE MISERY OF COLD AND FROST TO WHICH I AM IMPASSIVE YOU WILL FIND NEAR THIS PLACE IF YOU FOLLOW NOT TOO TARDILY A DEAD HARE
78-369-0031 AGAIN DO I VOW VENGEANCE AGAIN DO I DEVOTE THEE MISERABLE FIEND TO TORTURE AND DEATH NEVER WILL I GIVE UP MY SEARCH UNTIL HE OR I PERISH AND THEN WITH WHAT ECSTASY
78-369-0032 THE PEASANTS WERE SHUT UP IN THEIR HOVELS AND ONLY A FEW OF THE MOST HARDY VENTURED FORTH TO SEIZE THE ANIMALS WHOM STARVATION HAD FORCED FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES TO SEEK FOR PREY THE RIVERS WERE COVERED WITH ICE
78-369-0033 AND NO FISH COULD BE PROCURED AND THUS I WAS CUT OFF FROM MY CHIEF ARTICLE OF MAINTENANCE THE TRIUMPH OF MY ENEMY INCREASED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF MY LABOURS
78-369-0034 ONE INSCRIPTION THAT HE LEFT WAS IN THESE WORDS PREPARE YOUR TOILS ONLY BEGIN WRAP YOURSELF IN FURS AND PROVIDE FOOD FOR WE SHALL SOON ENTER UPON A JOURNEY WHERE YOUR SUFFERINGS
78-369-0035 WILL SATISFY MY EVERLASTING HATRED MY COURAGE AND PERSEVERANCE WERE INVIGORATED BY THESE SCOFFING WORDS
78-369-0036 AND CALLING ON HEAVEN TO SUPPORT ME I CONTINUED WITH UNABATED FERVOUR TO TRAVERSE IMMENSE DESERTS UNTIL THE OCEAN APPEARED AT A DISTANCE AND FORMED THE UTMOST BOUNDARY OF THE HORIZON
78-369-0037 OH HOW UNLIKE IT WAS TO THE BLUE SEASONS OF THE SOUTH COVERED WITH ICE IT WAS ONLY TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM LAND BY ITS SUPERIOR WILDNESS AND RUGGEDNESS
78-369-0038 THE GREEKS WEPT FOR JOY WHEN THEY BEHELD THE MEDITERRANEAN FROM THE HILLS OF ASIA AND HAILED WITH RAPTURE THE BOUNDARY OF THEIR TOILS I DID NOT WEEP BUT I KNELT DOWN
78-369-0039 AND WITH A FULL HEART THANKED MY GUIDING SPIRIT FOR CONDUCTING ME IN SAFETY TO THE PLACE WHERE I HOPED NOTWITHSTANDING MY ADVERSARY'S GIBE TO MEET AND GRAPPLE WITH HIM
78-369-0040 SOME WEEKS BEFORE THIS PERIOD I HAD PROCURED A SLEDGE AND DOGS AND THUS TRAVERSED THE SNOWS WITH INCONCEIVABLE SPEED
78-369-0041 AND I HOPED TO INTERCEPT HIM BEFORE HE SHOULD REACH THE BEACH WITH NEW COURAGE THEREFORE I PRESSED ON AND IN TWO DAYS ARRIVED AT A WRETCHED HAMLET ON THE SEASHORE I INQUIRED OF THE INHABITANTS
78-369-0042 CONCERNING THE FIEND AND GAINED ACCURATE INFORMATION A GIGANTIC MONSTER THEY SAID HAD ARRIVED THE NIGHT BEFORE ARMED WITH A GUN AND MANY PISTOLS PUTTING TO FLIGHT THE INHABITANTS OF A SOLITARY COTTAGE
78-369-0043 THROUGH FEAR OF HIS TERRIFIC APPEARANCE HE HAD CARRIED OFF THEIR STORE OF WINTER FOOD AND PLACING IT IN A SLEDGE TO DRAW WHICH HE HAD SEIZED ON A NUMEROUS DROVE OF TRAINED DOGS
78-369-0044 HE HAD HARNESSED THEM AND THE SAME NIGHT TO THE JOY OF THE HORROR STRUCK VILLAGERS HAD PURSUED HIS JOURNEY ACROSS THE SEA IN A DIRECTION THAT LED TO NO LAND AND THEY CONJECTURED
78-369-0045 AMIDST COLD THAT FEW OF THE INHABITANTS COULD LONG ENDURE AND WHICH I THE NATIVE OF A GENIAL AND SUNNY CLIMATE COULD NOT HOPE TO SURVIVE YET AT THE IDEA THAT THE FIEND SHOULD LIVE AND BE TRIUMPHANT
78-369-0046 MY RAGE AND VENGEANCE RETURNED AND LIKE A MIGHTY TIDE OVERWHELMED EVERY OTHER FEELING AFTER A SLIGHT REPOSE DURING WHICH THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD HOVERED ROUND AND INSTIGATED ME TO TOIL AND REVENGE
78-369-0047 I DEPARTED FROM LAND I CANNOT GUESS HOW MANY DAYS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN BUT I HAVE ENDURED MISERY WHICH NOTHING BUT THE ETERNAL SENTIMENT
78-369-0048 WHICH THREATENED MY DESTRUCTION BUT AGAIN THE FROST CAME AND MADE THE PATHS OF THE SEA SECURE
78-369-0049 I SHOULD GUESS THAT I HAD PASSED THREE WEEKS IN THIS JOURNEY AND THE CONTINUAL PROTRACTION OF HOPE RETURNING BACK UPON THE HEART OFTEN WRUNG BITTER DROPS OF DESPONDENCY AND GRIEF FROM MY EYES
78-369-0050 DESPAIR HAD INDEED ALMOST SECURED HER PREY AND I SHOULD SOON HAVE SUNK BENEATH THIS MISERY ONCE AFTER THE POOR ANIMALS THAT CONVEYED ME HAD WITH INCREDIBLE TOIL
78-369-0051 GAINED THE SUMMIT OF A SLOPING ICE MOUNTAIN AND ONE SINKING UNDER HIS FATIGUE DIED I VIEWED THE EXPANSE BEFORE ME WITH ANGUISH WHEN SUDDENLY MY EYE CAUGHT A DARK SPECK UPON THE DUSKY PLAIN
78-369-0052 WHAT IT COULD BE AND UTTERED A WILD CRY OF ECSTASY WHEN I DISTINGUISHED A SLEDGE AND THE DISTORTED PROPORTIONS OF A WELL KNOWN FORM WITHIN
78-369-0053 WARM TEARS FILLED MY EYES WHICH I HASTILY WIPED AWAY THAT THEY MIGHT NOT INTERCEPT THE VIEW I HAD OF THE DAEMON BUT STILL MY SIGHT WAS DIMMED BY THE BURNING DROPS UNTIL
78-369-0054 WHEN FOR A SHORT TIME SOME ICE ROCK CONCEALED IT WITH ITS INTERVENING CRAGS I INDEED PERCEPTIBLY GAINED ON IT AND WHEN AFTER NEARLY TWO DAYS JOURNEY
78-369-0055 MY HEART BOUNDED WITHIN ME BUT NOW WHEN I APPEARED ALMOST WITHIN GRASP OF MY FOE MY HOPES WERE SUDDENLY EXTINGUISHED AND I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM MORE UTTERLY THAN I HAD EVER DONE BEFORE
78-369-0056 AS WITH THE MIGHTY SHOCK OF AN EARTHQUAKE IT SPLIT AND CRACKED WITH A TREMENDOUS AND OVERWHELMING SOUND THE WORK WAS SOON FINISHED IN A FEW MINUTES A TUMULTUOUS SEA ROLLED BETWEEN ME AND MY ENEMY
78-369-0057 AND I WAS LEFT DRIFTING ON A SCATTERED PIECE OF ICE THAT WAS CONTINUALLY LESSENING AND THUS PREPARING FOR ME A HIDEOUS DEATH
