226-131533-0015 MISSUS GRAHAM AND I ARE TWO FRIENDS AND WILL BE AND NO MAN BREATHING SHALL HINDER IT OR HAS A RIGHT TO INTERFERE BETWEEN US BUT IF YOU KNEW HOW THEY TALK YOU WOULD BE MORE CAREFUL FOR HER SAKE AS WELL AS FOR YOUR OWN
226-131533-0016 JANE WILSON THINKS YOUR VISITS TO THE OLD HALL BUT ANOTHER PROOF OF HER DEPRAVITY CONFOUND JANE WILSON AND ELIZA MILLWARD IS QUITE GRIEVED ABOUT YOU I HOPE SHE IS
226-131533-0017 BUT I WOULDN'T IF I WERE YOU WOULDN'T WHAT HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT I GO THERE THERE'S NOTHING HID FROM THEM THEY SPY OUT EVERYTHING OH I NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS
226-131533-0018 AND SO THEY DARE TO TURN MY FRIENDSHIP INTO FOOD FOR FURTHER SCANDAL AGAINST HER THAT PROVES THE FALSEHOOD OF THEIR OTHER LIES AT ALL EVENTS IF ANY PROOF WERE WANTING MIND YOU CONTRADICT THEM ROSE WHENEVER YOU CAN
226-131533-0019 BUT THEY DON'T SPEAK OPENLY TO ME ABOUT SUCH THINGS IT IS ONLY BY HINTS AND INNUENDOES AND BY WHAT I HEAR OTHERS SAY THAT I KNEW WHAT THEY THINK WELL THEN I WON'T GO TO DAY AS IT'S GETTING LATISH
226-131533-0020 AFTER HIS CUSTOMARY CHEERFUL AND FATHERLY GREETING OF ROSE WHO WAS RATHER A FAVOURITE WITH THE OLD GENTLEMAN HE TURNED SOMEWHAT STERNLY TO ME WELL SIR SAID HE YOU'RE QUITE A STRANGER IT IS
226-131533-0021 AS HE DEPOSITED HIS PONDEROUS BULK IN THE ARM CHAIR THAT ROSE OFFICIOUSLY BROUGHT TOWARDS HIM IT IS JUST SIX WEEKS BY MY RECKONING SINCE YOU DARKENED MY DOOR HE SPOKE IT WITH EMPHASIS AND STRUCK HIS STICK ON THE FLOOR
226-131533-0022 IS IT SIR SAID I AY IT IS SO HE ADDED AN AFFIRMATORY NOD AND CONTINUED TO GAZE UPON ME WITH A KIND OF IRATE SOLEMNITY HOLDING HIS SUBSTANTIAL STICK BETWEEN HIS KNEES
226-131533-0023 WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED UPON ITS HEAD I HAVE BEEN BUSY I SAID FOR AN APOLOGY WAS EVIDENTLY DEMANDED BUSY REPEATED HE DERISIVELY YES YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN GETTING IN MY HAY
226-131533-0024 IN TIME FOR TEA BUT OFFERED TO HAVE SOME IMMEDIATELY PREPARED IF HE WOULD DO HER THE FAVOUR TO PARTAKE OF IT NOT ANY FOR ME I THANK YOU REPLIED HE I SHALL BE AT HOME IN A FEW MINUTES OH BUT DO STAY AND TAKE A LITTLE
226-131533-0025 IT WILL BE READY IN FIVE MINUTES BUT HE REJECTED THE OFFER WITH A MAJESTIC WAVE OF THE HAND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL TAKE MISSUS MARKHAM SAID HE I'LL TAKE A GLASS OF YOUR EXCELLENT ALE
226-131533-0026 WITH PLEASURE CRIED MY MOTHER PROCEEDING WITH ALACRITY TO PULL THE BELL AND ORDER THE FAVOURED BEVERAGE I THOUGHT CONTINUED HE I'D JUST LOOK IN UPON YOU AS I PASSED AND TASTE YOUR HOME BREWED ALE
226-131533-0027 REALLY EJACULATED MY MOTHER WHY SO MISTER MILLWARD ASKED I HE LOOKED AT ME WITH SOME SEVERITY AND TURNING AGAIN TO MY MOTHER REPEATED
226-131533-0028 AND STRUCK HIS STICK ON THE FLOOR AGAIN MY MOTHER SAT OPPOSITE AN AWE STRUCK BUT ADMIRING AUDITOR MISSUS GRAHAM SAID I HE CONTINUED SHAKING HIS HEAD AS HE SPOKE
226-131533-0029 THESE ARE TERRIBLE REPORTS WHAT SIR SAYS SHE AFFECTING TO BE IGNORANT OF MY MEANING IT IS MY DUTY AS YOUR PASTOR SAID I TO TELL YOU BOTH EVERYTHING THAT I MYSELF SEE REPREHENSIBLE IN YOUR CONDUCT
226-131533-0030 AND ALL I HAVE REASON TO SUSPECT AND WHAT OTHERS TELL ME CONCERNING YOU SO I TOLD HER YOU DID SIR CRIED I STARTING FROM MY SEAT AND STRIKING MY FIST ON THE TABLE
226-131533-0031 BUT SHE OFFERED NO EXTENUATION OR DEFENCE AND WITH A KIND OF SHAMELESS CALMNESS SHOCKING INDEED TO WITNESS IN ONE SO YOUNG AS GOOD AS TOLD ME THAT MY REMONSTRANCE WAS UNAVAILING AND MY PASTORAL ADVICE QUITE THROWN AWAY UPON HER
226-131533-0032 NAY THAT MY VERY PRESENCE WAS DISPLEASING WHILE I SPOKE SUCH THINGS AND I WITHDREW AT LENGTH TOO PLAINLY SEEING THAT NOTHING COULD BE DONE AND SADLY GRIEVED TO FIND HER CASE SO HOPELESS
226-131533-0033 BUT I AM FULLY DETERMINED MISSUS MARKHAM THAT MY DAUGHTERS SHALL NOT CONSORT WITH HER DO YOU ADOPT THE SAME RESOLUTION WITH REGARD TO YOURS AS FOR YOUR SONS AS FOR YOU YOUNG MAN HE CONTINUED STERNLY TURNING TO ME
226-131533-0034 SLAMMING THE DOOR BEHIND ME WITH A BANG THAT SHOOK THE HOUSE TO ITS FOUNDATIONS AND MADE MY MOTHER SCREAM AND GAVE A MOMENTARY RELIEF TO MY EXCITED FEELINGS
226-131533-0035 THE NEXT MINUTE SAW ME HURRYING WITH RAPID STRIDES IN THE DIRECTION OF WILDFELL HALL TO WHAT INTENT OR PURPOSE I COULD SCARCELY TELL BUT I MUST BE MOVING SOMEWHERE AND NO OTHER GOAL WOULD DO
226-131533-0036 I MUST SEE HER TOO AND SPEAK TO HER THAT WAS CERTAIN BUT WHAT TO SAY OR HOW TO ACT I HAD NO DEFINITE IDEA
229-130880-0000 RIGHT OFF I OBSERVED A CLUSTER OF MOUNTAINS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FEET HIGH WHOSE SHAPES WERE VERY WHIMSICALLY SCULPTED AFTER OUR POSITION FIX I REENTERED THE LOUNGE AND WHEN OUR BEARINGS WERE REPORTED ON THE CHART I SAW THAT WE WERE OFF THE ISLAND OF CEYLON
229-130880-0001 THAT PEARL DANGLING FROM THE LOWER LOBE OF THE INDIAN PENINSULA I WENT LOOKING IN THE LIBRARY FOR A BOOK ABOUT THIS ISLAND ONE OF THE MOST FERTILE IN THE WORLD SURE ENOUGH I FOUND A VOLUME ENTITLED CEYLON AND THE SINGHALESE
229-130880-0002 REENTERING THE LOUNGE I FIRST NOTED THE BEARINGS OF CEYLON ON WHICH ANTIQUITY LAVISHED SO MANY DIFFERENT NAMES
229-130880-0003 ITS LENGTH IS TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILES ITS MAXIMUM WIDTH ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES ITS CIRCUMFERENCE NINE HUNDRED MILES ITS SURFACE AREA TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT SQUARE MILES
229-130880-0004 IN OTHER WORDS A LITTLE SMALLER THAN THAT OF IRELAND JUST THEN CAPTAIN NEMO AND HIS CHIEF OFFICER APPEARED THE CAPTAIN GLANCED AT THE CHART THEN TURNING TO ME THE ISLAND OF CEYLON HE SAID
229-130880-0005 IS FAMOUS FOR ITS PEARL FISHERIES WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED PROFESSOR ARONNAX
229-130880-0006 CERTAINLY CAPTAIN FINE IT'S EASILY DONE ONLY WHEN WE SEE THE FISHERIES WE'LL SEE NO FISHERMEN
229-130880-0007 AND WE'LL ARRIVE THERE LATE TONIGHT
229-130880-0008 WHO WENT OUT IMMEDIATELY SOON THE NAUTILUS REENTERED ITS LIQUID ELEMENT AND THE PRESSURE GAUGE INDICATED THAT IT WAS STAYING AT A DEPTH OF THIRTY FEET WITH THE CHART UNDER MY EYES
229-130880-0009 I FOUND IT BY THE NINTH PARALLEL OFF THE NORTHWESTERN SHORES OF CEYLON
229-130880-0010 TO REACH IT WE HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY UP CEYLON'S WEST COAST PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO THEN TOLD ME THERE ARE PEARL FISHERIES IN THE BAY OF BENGAL THE SEAS OF THE EAST INDIES
229-130880-0011 THE SEAS OF CHINA AND JAPAN PLUS THOSE SEAS SOUTH OF THE UNITED STATES THE GULF OF PANAMA AND THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S OFF CEYLON THAT SUCH FISHING REAPS ITS RICHEST REWARDS NO DOUBT WE'LL BE ARRIVING A LITTLE EARLY
229-130880-0012 ONLY DURING THE MONTH OF MARCH AND FOR THIRTY DAYS SOME THREE HUNDRED BOATS CONCENTRATE ON THE LUCRATIVE HARVEST OF THESE TREASURES FROM THE SEA EACH BOAT IS MANNED BY TEN OARSMEN AND TEN FISHERMEN THE LATTER DIVIDE INTO TWO GROUPS
229-130880-0013 DIVE IN ROTATION AND DESCEND TO A DEPTH OF TWELVE METERS WITH THE HELP OF A HEAVY STONE CLUTCHED BETWEEN THEIR FEET AND ATTACHED BY A ROPE TO THEIR BOAT YOU MEAN I SAID
229-130880-0014 THAT SUCH PRIMITIVE METHODS ARE STILL ALL THAT THEY USE ALL
229-130880-0015 ALTHOUGH THESE FISHERIES BELONG TO THE MOST INDUSTRIALIZED PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THE ENGLISH
229-130880-0016 YET IT STRIKES ME THAT DIVING SUITS LIKE YOURS COULD PERFORM YEOMAN SERVICE IN SUCH WORK YES SINCE THOSE POOR FISHERMEN CAN'T STAY LONG UNDERWATER ON HIS VOYAGE TO CEYLON
229-130880-0017 THE ENGLISHMAN PERCIVAL MADE MUCH OF A KAFFIR WHO STAYED UNDER FIVE MINUTES WITHOUT COMING UP TO THE SURFACE BUT I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE
229-130880-0018 I KNOW THAT SOME DIVERS CAN LAST UP TO FIFTY SEVEN SECONDS AND HIGHLY SKILLFUL ONES TO EIGHTY SEVEN BUT SUCH MEN ARE RARE
229-130880-0019 I BELIEVE THE AVERAGE TIME UNDERWATER THAT THESE FISHERMEN CAN TOLERATE IS THIRTY SECONDS DURING WHICH THEY HASTILY STUFF THEIR LITTLE NETS WITH ALL THE PEARL OYSTERS THEY CAN TEAR LOOSE
229-130880-0020 THEIR VISION WEAKENS ULCERS BREAK OUT ON THEIR EYES SORES FORM ON THEIR BODIES AND SOME ARE EVEN STRICKEN WITH APOPLEXY ON THE OCEAN FLOOR YES I SAID IT'S A SAD OCCUPATION
229-130880-0021 AND ONE THAT EXISTS ONLY TO GRATIFY THE WHIMS OF FASHION BUT TELL ME CAPTAIN HOW MANY OYSTERS CAN A BOAT FISH UP IN A WORKDAY
229-130880-0022 IT'S EVEN SAID THAT IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN WHEN THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT WENT FISHING ON ITS OWN BEHALF ITS DIVERS WORKED JUST TWENTY DAYS AND BROUGHT UP SEVENTY SIX MILLION OYSTERS
229-130880-0023 THE FISHERMEN ARE WELL PAID AREN'T THEY HARDLY PROFESSOR IN PANAMA THEY MAKE JUST ONE DOLLAR PER WEEK IN MOST PLACES THEY EARN ONLY A PENNY FOR EACH OYSTER THAT HAS A PEARL AND THEY BRING UP SO MANY THAT HAVE NONE
229-130880-0024 ONLY ONE PENNY TO THOSE POOR PEOPLE WHO MAKE THEIR EMPLOYERS RICH THAT'S ATROCIOUS ON THAT NOTE PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO TOLD ME
229-130880-0025 AND IF BY CHANCE SOME EAGER FISHERMAN ARRIVES EARLY WELL WE CAN WATCH HIM AT WORK THAT SUITS ME CAPTAIN BY THE WAY PROFESSOR ARONNAX YOU AREN'T AFRAID OF SHARKS ARE YOU SHARKS I EXCLAIMED
229-130880-0026 THIS STRUCK ME AS A PRETTY NEEDLESS QUESTION TO SAY THE LEAST WELL CAPTAIN NEMO WENT ON I ADMIT CAPTAIN I'M NOT YET ON VERY FAMILIAR TERMS WITH THAT GENUS OF FISH WE'RE USED TO THEM
229-130880-0027 THE REST OF US CAPTAIN NEMO ANSWERED AND IN TIME YOU WILL BE TOO ANYHOW WE'LL BE ARMED AND ON OUR WAY WE MIGHT HUNT A MAN EATER OR TWO IT'S A FASCINATING SPORT SO PROFESSOR I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW
229-130880-0028 BRIGHT AND EARLY THIS SAID IN A CAREFREE TONE CAPTAIN NEMO LEFT THE LOUNGE IF YOU'RE INVITED TO HUNT BEARS IN THE SWISS MOUNTAINS YOU MIGHT SAY OH GOOD I GET TO GO BEAR HUNTING TOMORROW
229-130880-0029 IF YOU'RE INVITED TO HUNT LIONS ON THE ATLAS PLAINS OR TIGERS IN THE JUNGLES OF INDIA YOU MIGHT SAY HA NOW'S MY CHANCE TO HUNT LIONS AND TIGERS BUT IF YOU'RE INVITED TO HUNT SHARKS IN THEIR NATIVE ELEMENT
229-130880-0030 YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK IT OVER BEFORE ACCEPTING AS FOR ME I PASSED A HAND OVER MY BROW WHERE BEADS OF COLD SWEAT WERE BUSY FORMING LET'S THINK THIS OVER I SAID TO MYSELF AND LET'S TAKE OUR TIME
229-130880-0031 HUNTING OTTERS IN UNDERWATER FORESTS AS WE DID IN THE FORESTS OF CRESPO ISLAND IS AN ACCEPTABLE ACTIVITY
229-130880-0032 THAT'S ANOTHER STORY I KNOW THAT IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES PARTICULARLY THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS NEGROES DON'T HESITATE TO ATTACK SHARKS DAGGER IN ONE HAND AND NOOSE IN THE OTHER
229-130880-0033 BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT MANY WHO FACE THOSE FEARSOME ANIMALS DON'T COME BACK ALIVE BESIDES I'M NOT A NEGRO AND EVEN IF I WERE A NEGRO IN THIS INSTANCE I DON'T THINK A LITTLE HESITATION ON MY PART WOULD BE OUT OF PLACE
229-130880-0034 AND THERE I WAS FANTASIZING ABOUT SHARKS ENVISIONING HUGE JAWS ARMED WITH MULTIPLE ROWS OF TEETH AND CAPABLE OF CUTTING A MAN IN HALF I COULD ALREADY FEEL A DEFINITE PAIN AROUND MY PELVIC GIRDLE
229-130880-0035 AND HOW I RESENTED THE OFFHAND MANNER IN WHICH THE CAPTAIN HAD EXTENDED HIS DEPLORABLE INVITATION
229-130880-0036 THANK HEAVENS I SAID TO MYSELF CONSEIL WILL NEVER WANT TO COME ALONG AND THAT'LL BE MY EXCUSE FOR NOT GOING WITH THE CAPTAIN AS FOR NED LAND I ADMIT I FELT LESS CONFIDENT OF HIS WISDOM
229-130880-0037 DANGER HOWEVER GREAT HELD A PERENNIAL ATTRACTION FOR HIS AGGRESSIVE NATURE I WENT BACK TO READING SIRR'S BOOK BUT I LEAFED THROUGH IT MECHANICALLY BETWEEN THE LINES I KEPT SEEING FEARSOME WIDE OPEN JAWS
229-130880-0038 JUST THEN CONSEIL AND THE CANADIAN ENTERED WITH A CALM EVEN GLEEFUL AIR LITTLE DID THEY KNOW WHAT WAS WAITING FOR THEM YE GODS SIR NED LAND TOLD ME YOUR CAPTAIN NEMO THE DEVIL TAKE HIM
229-130880-0039 HAS JUST MADE US A VERY PLEASANT PROPOSITION OH I SAID YOU KNOW ABOUT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MASTER CONSEIL REPLIED THE NAUTILUS'S COMMANDER HAS INVITED US TOGETHER WITH MASTER
229-130880-0040 FOR A VISIT TOMORROW TO CEYLON'S MAGNIFICENT PEARL FISHERIES HE DID SO IN THE MOST CORDIAL TERMS AND CONDUCTED HIMSELF LIKE A TRUE GENTLEMAN HE DIDN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING ELSE NOTHING SIR THE CANADIAN REPLIED
229-130880-0041 HE SAID YOU'D ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS LITTLE STROLL INDEED I SAID BUT DIDN'T HE GIVE YOU ANY DETAILS ON NOT A ONE MISTER NATURALIST YOU WILL BE GOING WITH US RIGHT ME
229-130880-0042 WHY YES CERTAINLY OF COURSE I CAN SEE THAT YOU LIKE THE IDEA MISTER LAND YES IT WILL BE A REALLY UNUSUAL EXPERIENCE AND POSSIBLY DANGEROUS I ADDED IN AN INSINUATING TONE
229-130880-0043 DANGEROUS NED LAND REPLIED A SIMPLE TRIP TO AN OYSTERBANK ASSUREDLY
229-130880-0044 FOR MY PART I STARED AT THEM WITH ANXIOUS EYES AS IF THEY WERE ALREADY MISSING A LIMB OR TWO SHOULD I ALERT THEM YES SURELY BUT I HARDLY KNEW HOW TO GO ABOUT IT WOULD MASTER
229-130880-0045 CONSEIL SAID TO ME GIVE US SOME BACKGROUND ON PEARL FISHING ON THE FISHING ITSELF I ASKED OR ON THE OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS THAT ON THE FISHING THE CANADIAN REPLIED BEFORE WE TACKLE THE TERRAIN IT HELPS TO BE FAMILIAR WITH IT
229-130880-0046 ALL RIGHT SIT DOWN MY FRIENDS
229-130880-0047 NED AND CONSEIL TOOK SEATS ON A COUCH AND RIGHT OFF THE CANADIAN SAID TO ME SIR JUST WHAT IS A PEARL EXACTLY MY GALLANT NED I REPLIED FOR POETS A PEARL IS A TEAR FROM THE SEA
229-130880-0048 FOR ORIENTALS IT'S A DROP OF SOLIDIFIED DEW FOR THE LADIES IT'S A JEWEL
229-130880-0049 NECKS AND EARS THAT'S OBLONG IN SHAPE GLASSY IN LUSTER AND FORMED FROM MOTHER OF PEARL FOR CHEMISTS IT'S A MIXTURE OF CALCIUM PHOSPHATE AND CALCIUM CARBONATE WITH A LITTLE GELATIN PROTEIN
229-130880-0050 AND FINALLY FOR NATURALISTS IT'S A SIMPLE FESTERING SECRETION FROM THE ORGAN THAT PRODUCES MOTHER OF PEARL IN CERTAIN BIVALVES BRANCH MOLLUSCA CONSEIL SAID CLASS
229-130880-0051 ACEPHALA ORDER TESTACEA CORRECT MY SCHOLARLY CONSEIL NOW THEN THOSE TESTACEA CAPABLE OF PRODUCING PEARLS INCLUDE RAINBOW ABALONE
229-130880-0052 TURBO SNAILS GIANT CLAMS AND SALTWATER SCALLOPS BRIEFLY ALL THOSE THAT SECRETE MOTHER OF PEARL IN OTHER WORDS THAT BLUE AZURE VIOLET OR WHITE SUBSTANCE
229-130880-0053 LINING THE INSIDES OF THEIR VALVES ARE MUSSELS INCLUDED TOO THE CANADIAN ASKED YES THE MUSSELS OF CERTAIN STREAMS IN SCOTLAND WALES IRELAND SAXONY BOHEMIA AND FRANCE
229-130880-0054 GOOD THE CANADIAN REPLIED FROM NOW ON WE'LL PAY CLOSER ATTENTION TO EM BUT I WENT ON FOR SECRETING PEARLS THE IDEAL MOLLUSK IS THE PEARL OYSTER MELEAGRINA MARGARITIFERA
229-130880-0055 THAT VALUABLE SHELLFISH PEARLS RESULT SIMPLY FROM MOTHER OF PEARL SOLIDIFYING INTO A GLOBULAR SHAPE EITHER THEY STICK TO THE OYSTER'S SHELL OR THEY BECOME EMBEDDED IN THE CREATURE'S FOLDS
229-130880-0056 ON THE VALVES A PEARL STICKS FAST ON THE FLESH IT LIES LOOSE BUT ITS NUCLEUS IS ALWAYS SOME SMALL HARD OBJECT SAY A STERILE EGG OR A GRAIN OF SAND
229-130880-0057 AROUND WHICH THE MOTHER OF PEARL IS DEPOSITED IN THIN CONCENTRIC LAYERS OVER SEVERAL YEARS IN SUCCESSION CAN ONE FIND SEVERAL PEARLS IN THE SAME OYSTER CONSEIL ASKED YES MY BOY
229-130880-0058 THEY EVEN MENTION ONE OYSTER ABOUT WHICH I REMAIN DUBIOUS
229-130880-0059 NED LAND YELPED DID I SAY SHARKS I EXCLAIMED HASTILY I MEANT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PEARLS SHARKS WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE INDEED CONSEIL SAID
229-130880-0060 BUT WILL MASTER NOW TELL US HOW ONE GOES ABOUT EXTRACTING THESE PEARLS ONE PROCEEDS IN SEVERAL WAYS AND OFTEN WHEN PEARLS STICK TO THE VALVES FISHERMEN EVEN PULL THEM LOOSE WITH PLIERS
229-130880-0061 THUS THEY DIE IN THE OPEN AIR AND BY THE END OF TEN DAYS THEY'VE ROTTED SUFFICIENTLY NEXT THEY'RE IMMERSED IN HUGE TANKS OF SALT WATER THEN THEY'RE OPENED UP AND WASHED AT THIS POINT THE SORTERS BEGIN THEIR TWOFOLD TASK
229-130880-0062 FIRST THEY REMOVE THE LAYERS OF MOTHER OF PEARL WHICH ARE KNOWN IN THE INDUSTRY BY THE NAMES LEGITIMATE SILVER BASTARD WHITE OR BASTARD BLACK
229-130880-0063 THEN THEY REMOVE THE OYSTER'S MEATY TISSUE BOIL IT AND FINALLY STRAIN IT IN ORDER TO EXTRACT EVEN THE SMALLEST PEARLS DO THE PRICES OF THESE PEARLS DIFFER DEPENDING ON THEIR SIZE CONSEIL ASKED NOT ONLY ON THEIR SIZE I REPLIED
229-130880-0064 BUT ALSO ACCORDING TO THEIR SHAPE THEIR WATER IN OTHER WORDS THEIR COLOR AND THEIR ORIENT IN OTHER WORDS THAT DAPPLED SHIMMERING GLOW THAT MAKES THEM SO DELIGHTFUL TO THE EYE THE FINEST PEARLS ARE CALLED VIRGIN PEARLS OR PARAGONS
229-130880-0065 THEY FORM IN ISOLATION WITHIN THE MOLLUSK'S TISSUE THEY'RE WHITE OFTEN OPAQUE BUT SOMETIMES OF OPALESCENT TRANSPARENCY AND USUALLY SPHERICAL OR PEAR SHAPED THE SPHERICAL ONES ARE MADE INTO BRACELETS
229-130880-0066 THE PEAR SHAPED ONES INTO EARRINGS AND SINCE THEY'RE THE MOST VALUABLE THEY'RE PRICED INDIVIDUALLY THE OTHER PEARLS THAT STICK TO THE OYSTER'S SHELL ARE MORE ERRATICALLY SHAPED AND ARE PRICED BY WEIGHT FINALLY CLASSED IN THE LOWEST ORDER
229-130880-0067 THE SMALLEST PEARLS ARE KNOWN BY THE NAME SEED PEARLS THEY'RE PRICED BY THE MEASURING CUP AND ARE USED MAINLY IN THE CREATION OF EMBROIDERY FOR CHURCH VESTMENTS BUT IT MUST BE A LONG HARD JOB SORTING OUT THESE PEARLS BY SIZE
229-130880-0068 THE CANADIAN SAID NO MY FRIEND THAT TASK IS PERFORMED WITH ELEVEN STRAINERS OR SIEVES THAT ARE PIERCED WITH DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF HOLES THOSE PEARLS STAYING IN THE STRAINERS WITH TWENTY TO EIGHTY HOLES ARE IN THE FIRST ORDER
229-130880-0069 THOSE NOT SLIPPING THROUGH THE SIEVES PIERCED WITH ONE HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED HOLES ARE IN THE SECOND ORDER FINALLY THOSE PEARLS FOR WHICH ONE USES STRAINERS PIERCED WITH NINE HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND HOLES MAKE UP THE SEED PEARLS
229-130880-0070 HOW INGENIOUS CONSEIL SAID TO REDUCE DIVIDING AND CLASSIFYING PEARLS TO A MECHANICAL OPERATION AND COULD MASTER TELL US THE PROFITS BROUGHT IN BY HARVESTING THESE BANKS OF PEARL OYSTERS ACCORDING TO SIRR'S BOOK I REPLIED
229-130880-0071 THESE CEYLON FISHERIES ARE FARMED ANNUALLY FOR A TOTAL PROFIT OF THREE MILLION MAN EATERS FRANCS CONSEIL REBUKED YES FRANCS THREE MILLION FRANCS I WENT ON
229-130880-0072 BUT I DON'T THINK THESE FISHERIES BRING IN THE RETURNS THEY ONCE DID SIMILARLY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN FISHERIES
229-130880-0073 BUT NOW THEY BRING IN ONLY TWO THIRDS OF THAT AMOUNT ALL IN ALL IT'S ESTIMATED THAT NINE MILLION FRANCS IS THE CURRENT YEARLY RETURN FOR THE WHOLE PEARL HARVESTING INDUSTRY BUT CONSEIL ASKED
229-130880-0074 HAVEN'T CERTAIN FAMOUS PEARLS BEEN QUOTED AT EXTREMELY HIGH PRICES YES MY BOY
229-130880-0075 I'VE EVEN HEARD STORIES THE CANADIAN SAID ABOUT SOME LADY IN ANCIENT TIMES WHO DRANK PEARLS IN VINEGAR CLEOPATRA CONSEIL SHOT BACK IT MUST HAVE TASTED PRETTY BAD NED LAND ADDED ABOMINABLE NED MY FRIEND
229-130880-0076 CONSEIL REPLIED BUT WHEN A LITTLE GLASS OF VINEGAR IS WORTH ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS ITS TASTE IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY
229-130880-0077 NED LAND MARRIED TO CLEOPATRA CONSEIL EXCLAIMED BUT I WAS ALL SET TO TIE THE KNOT CONSEIL THE CANADIAN REPLIED IN ALL SERIOUSNESS
229-130880-0078 I EVEN BOUGHT A PEARL NECKLACE FOR MY FIANCEE KATE TENDER BUT SHE MARRIED SOMEBODY ELSE INSTEAD
229-130880-0079 BUT YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY TRUST ME ON THIS PROFESSOR ITS PEARLS WERE SO BIG
229-130880-0080 MY GALLANT NED I REPLIED LAUGHING THOSE WERE ARTIFICIAL PEARLS ORDINARY GLASS BEADS WHOSE INSIDES WERE COATED WITH ESSENCE OF ORIENT WOW
229-130880-0081 THAT ESSENCE OF ORIENT MUST SELL FOR QUITE A LARGE SUM AS LITTLE AS ZERO IT COMES FROM THE SCALES OF A EUROPEAN CARP IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN A SILVER SUBSTANCE THAT COLLECTS IN THE WATER AND IS PRESERVED IN AMMONIA IT'S WORTHLESS
229-130880-0082 MAYBE THAT'S WHY KATE TENDER MARRIED SOMEBODY ELSE REPLIED MISTER LAND PHILOSOPHICALLY BUT I SAID GETTING BACK TO PEARLS OF GREAT VALUE I DON'T THINK ANY SOVEREIGN EVER POSSESSED ONE SUPERIOR TO THE PEARL OWNED BY CAPTAIN NEMO
229-130880-0083 THIS ONE CONSEIL SAID POINTING TO A MAGNIFICENT JEWEL IN ITS GLASS CASE EXACTLY AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT FAR OFF WHEN I ESTIMATE ITS VALUE AT TWO MILLION UH FRANCS
229-130880-0084 CONSEIL SAID QUICKLY YES I SAID TWO MILLION FRANCS AND NO DOUBT ALL IT COST OUR CAPTAIN WAS THE EFFORT TO PICK IT UP HA NED LAND EXCLAIMED DURING OUR STROLL TOMORROW WHO SAYS WE WON'T RUN INTO ONE JUST LIKE IT
229-130880-0085 CONSEIL PUT IN AND WHY NOT WHAT GOOD WOULD A PEARL WORTH MILLIONS DO US HERE ON THE NAUTILUS HERE NO NED LAND SAID BUT ELSEWHERE OH ELSEWHERE CONSEIL PUT IN
229-130880-0086 SHAKING HIS HEAD IN FACT I SAID MISTER LAND IS RIGHT AND IF WE EVER BROUGHT BACK TO EUROPE OR AMERICA A PEARL WORTH MILLIONS IT WOULD MAKE THE STORY OF OUR ADVENTURES MORE AUTHENTIC AND MUCH MORE REWARDING THAT'S HOW I SEE IT
229-130880-0087 THE CANADIAN SAID BUT SAID CONSEIL WHO PERPETUALLY RETURNED TO THE DIDACTIC SIDE OF THINGS IS THIS PEARL FISHING EVER DANGEROUS NO I REPLIED QUICKLY ESPECIALLY IF ONE TAKES CERTAIN PRECAUTIONS
229-130880-0088 WHAT RISKS WOULD YOU RUN IN A JOB LIKE THAT NED LAND SAID SWALLOWING A FEW GULPS OF SALT WATER WHATEVER YOU SAY NED THEN TRYING TO IMITATE CAPTAIN NEMO'S CAREFREE TONE I ASKED
229-130880-0089 BY THE WAY GALLANT NED ARE YOU AFRAID OF SHARKS
229-130880-0090 THE CANADIAN REPLIED I'M A PROFESSIONAL HARPOONER IT'S MY JOB TO MAKE A MOCKERY OF THEM IT ISN'T AN ISSUE I SAID OF FISHING FOR THEM WITH A SWIVEL HOOK HOISTING THEM ONTO THE DECK OF A SHIP
229-130880-0091 OPENING THE BELLY RIPPING OUT THE HEART AND TOSSING IT INTO THE SEA SO IT'S AN ISSUE OF YES PRECISELY IN THE WATER IN THE WATER YE GODS JUST GIVE ME A GOOD HARPOON
229-130880-0092 YOU SEE SIR THESE SHARKS ARE BADLY DESIGNED THEY HAVE TO ROLL THEIR BELLIES OVER TO SNAP YOU UP AND IN THE MEANTIME NED LAND HAD A WAY OF PRONOUNCING THE WORD SNAP
229-130880-0093 WELL HOW ABOUT YOU CONSEIL WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT THESE MAN EATERS ME CONSEIL SAID I'M AFRAID I MUST BE FRANK WITH MASTER GOOD FOR YOU I THOUGHT
233-134440-0000 IF YOU HAVE LIVED IN CITIES AND HAVE WALKED IN THE PARK ON A SUMMER AFTERNOON YOU HAVE PERHAPS SEEN BLINKING IN A CORNER OF HIS IRON CAGE
233-134440-0001 A HUGE GROTESQUE KIND OF MONKEY A CREATURE WITH UGLY SAGGING HAIRLESS SKIN BELOW HIS EYES AND A BRIGHT PURPLE UNDERBODY THIS MONKEY IS A TRUE MONSTER
233-134440-0002 IN THE COMPLETENESS OF HIS UGLINESS HE ACHIEVED A KIND OF PERVERTED BEAUTY CHILDREN STOPPING BEFORE THE CAGE ARE FASCINATED MEN TURN AWAY WITH AN AIR OF DISGUST AND WOMEN LINGER FOR A MOMENT
233-134440-0003 TRYING PERHAPS TO REMEMBER WHICH ONE OF THEIR MALE ACQUAINTANCES THE THING IN SOME FAINT WAY RESEMBLES HAD YOU BEEN IN THE EARLIER YEARS OF YOUR LIFE A CITIZEN OF THE VILLAGE OF WINESBURG OHIO
233-134440-0004 THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR YOU NO MYSTERY IN REGARD TO THE BEAST IN HIS CAGE IT IS LIKE WASH WILLIAMS YOU WOULD HAVE SAID AS HE SITS IN THE CORNER THERE THE BEAST IS EXACTLY LIKE OLD WASH
233-134440-0005 SITTING ON THE GRASS IN THE STATION YARD ON A SUMMER EVENING AFTER HE HAS CLOSED HIS OFFICE FOR THE NIGHT WASH WILLIAMS THE TELEGRAPH OPERATOR OF WINESBURG WAS THE UGLIEST THING IN TOWN HIS GIRTH WAS IMMENSE
233-134440-0006 HIS NECK THIN HIS LEGS FEEBLE HE WAS DIRTY EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM WAS UNCLEAN EVEN THE WHITES OF HIS EYES LOOKED SOILED I GO TOO FAST NOT EVERYTHING ABOUT WASH WAS UNCLEAN
233-134440-0007 HE TOOK CARE OF HIS HANDS HIS FINGERS WERE FAT BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND SHAPELY IN THE HAND THAT LAY ON THE TABLE BY THE INSTRUMENT IN THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE IN HIS YOUTH
233-134440-0008 WASH WILLIAMS HAD BEEN CALLED THE BEST TELEGRAPH OPERATOR IN THE STATE AND IN SPITE OF HIS DEGRADEMENT TO THE OBSCURE OFFICE AT WINESBURG HE WAS STILL PROUD OF HIS ABILITY
233-134440-0009 WASH WILLIAMS DID NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THE MEN OF THE TOWN IN WHICH HE LIVED I'LL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM HE SAID LOOKING WITH BLEARY EYES AT THE MEN WHO WALKED ALONG THE STATION PLATFORM
233-134440-0010 PAST THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE UP ALONG MAIN STREET HE WENT IN THE EVENING TO ED GRIFFITH'S SALOON AND AFTER DRINKING UNBELIEVABLE QUANTITIES OF BEER STAGGERED OFF TO HIS ROOM IN THE NEW WILLARD HOUSE AND TO HIS BED FOR THE NIGHT
233-134440-0011 WASH WILLIAMS WAS A MAN OF COURAGE A THING HAD HAPPENED TO HIM THAT MADE HIM HATE LIFE AND HE HATED IT WHOLEHEARTEDLY WITH THE ABANDON OF A POET FIRST OF ALL HE HATED WOMEN
233-134440-0012 BITCHES HE CALLED THEM HIS FEELING TOWARD MEN WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT HE PITIED THEM DOES NOT EVERY MAN LET HIS LIFE BE MANAGED FOR HIM BY SOME BITCH OR ANOTHER HE ASKED
233-134440-0013 IN WINESBURG NO ATTENTION WAS PAID TO WASH WILLIAMS AND HIS HATRED OF HIS FELLOWS ONCE MISSUS WHITE THE BANKER'S WIFE COMPLAINED TO THE TELEGRAPH COMPANY
233-134440-0014 AND SMELLED ABOMINABLY BUT NOTHING CAME OF HER COMPLAINT HERE AND THERE A MAN RESPECTED THE OPERATOR INSTINCTIVELY THE MAN FELT IN HIM A GLOWING RESENTMENT OF SOMETHING HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO RESENT
233-134440-0015 WHEN WASH WALKED THROUGH THE STREETS SUCH A ONE HAD AN INSTINCT TO PAY HIM HOMAGE TO RAISE HIS HAT OR TO BOW BEFORE HIM THE SUPERINTENDENT WHO HAD SUPERVISION OVER THE TELEGRAPH OPERATORS
233-134440-0016 ON THE RAILROAD THAT WENT THROUGH WINESBURG FELT THAT WAY HE HAD PUT WASH INTO THE OBSCURE OFFICE AT WINESBURG TO AVOID DISCHARGING HIM AND HE MEANT TO KEEP HIM THERE WHEN HE RECEIVED THE LETTER OF COMPLAINT FROM THE BANKER'S WIFE
233-134440-0017 HE TORE IT UP AND LAUGHED UNPLEASANTLY FOR SOME REASON HE THOUGHT OF HIS OWN WIFE AS HE TORE UP THE LETTER WASH WILLIAMS ONCE HAD A WIFE WHEN HE WAS STILL A YOUNG MAN HE MARRIED A WOMAN AT DAYTON OHIO
233-134440-0018 THE WOMAN WAS TALL AND SLENDER AND HAD BLUE EYES AND YELLOW HAIR WASH WAS HIMSELF A COMELY YOUTH HE LOVED THE WOMAN WITH A LOVE AS ABSORBING AS THE HATRED HE LATER FELT FOR ALL WOMEN
233-134440-0019 IN ALL OF WINESBURG THERE WAS BUT ONE PERSON WHO KNEW THE STORY OF THE THING THAT HAD MADE UGLY THE PERSON AND THE CHARACTER OF WASH WILLIAMS
233-134440-0020 HE ONCE TOLD THE STORY TO GEORGE WILLARD AND THE TELLING OF THE TALE CAME ABOUT IN THIS WAY GEORGE WILLARD WENT ONE EVENING TO WALK WITH BELLE CARPENTER A TRIMMER OF WOMEN'S HATS
233-134440-0021 WHO WORKED IN A MILLINERY SHOP KEPT BY MISSUS KATE MC HUGH THE YOUNG MAN WAS NOT IN LOVE WITH THE WOMAN
233-134440-0022 IN ED GRIFFITH'S SALOON BUT AS THEY WALKED ABOUT UNDER THE TREES THEY OCCASIONALLY EMBRACED THE NIGHT AND THEIR OWN THOUGHTS HAD AROUSED SOMETHING IN THEM AS THEY WERE RETURNING TO MAIN STREET THEY PASSED THE LITTLE LAWN
233-134440-0023 BESIDE THE RAILROAD STATION AND SAW WASH WILLIAMS APPARENTLY ASLEEP ON THE GRASS BENEATH A TREE ON THE NEXT EVENING THE OPERATOR AND GEORGE WILLARD WALKED OUT TOGETHER DOWN THE RAILROAD THEY WENT
233-134440-0024 AND SAT ON A PILE OF DECAYING RAILROAD TIES BESIDE THE TRACKS IT WAS THEN THAT THE OPERATOR TOLD THE YOUNG REPORTER HIS STORY OF HATE PERHAPS A DOZEN TIMES
233-134440-0025 GEORGE WILLARD AND THE STRANGE SHAPELESS MAN WHO LIVED AT HIS FATHER'S HOTEL HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF TALKING THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED AT THE HIDEOUS LEERING FACE
233-134440-0026 SOMETHING HE SAW LURKING IN THE STARING EYES TOLD HIM THAT THE MAN WHO HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO OTHERS HAD NEVERTHELESS SOMETHING TO SAY TO HIM
233-134440-0027 HE WAITED EXPECTANTLY WHEN THE OPERATOR REMAINED SILENT AND SEEMED TO HAVE CHANGED HIS MIND ABOUT TALKING HE TRIED TO MAKE CONVERSATION WERE YOU EVER MARRIED MISTER WILLIAMS HE BEGAN
233-134440-0028 I SUPPOSE YOU WERE AND YOUR WIFE IS DEAD IS THAT IT WASH WILLIAMS SPAT FORTH A SUCCESSION OF VILE OATHS YES SHE IS DEAD HE AGREED SHE IS DEAD AS ALL WOMEN ARE DEAD
233-134440-0029 SHE IS A LIVING DEAD THING WALKING IN THE SIGHT OF MEN AND MAKING THE EARTH FOUL BY HER PRESENCE STARING INTO THE BOY'S EYES THE MAN BECAME PURPLE WITH RAGE DON'T HAVE FOOL NOTIONS IN YOUR HEAD
233-134440-0030 HE COMMANDED MY WIFE SHE IS DEAD YES SURELY I TELL YOU ALL WOMEN ARE DEAD MY MOTHER YOUR MOTHER
233-134440-0031 AND WITH WHOM I SAW YOU WALKING ABOUT YESTERDAY ALL OF THEM THEY ARE ALL DEAD I TELL YOU THERE IS SOMETHING ROTTEN ABOUT THEM I WAS MARRIED SURE MY WIFE WAS DEAD BEFORE SHE MARRIED ME
233-134440-0032 SHE WAS A FOUL THING COME OUT A WOMAN MORE FOUL SHE WAS A THING SENT TO MAKE LIFE UNBEARABLE TO ME I WAS A FOOL DO YOU SEE AS YOU ARE NOW AND SO I MARRIED THIS WOMAN
233-134440-0033 I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MEN A LITTLE BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND WOMEN THEY ARE SENT TO PREVENT MEN MAKING THE WORLD WORTH WHILE IT IS A TRICK IN NATURE UGH THEY ARE CREEPING CRAWLING SQUIRMING THINGS
233-134440-0034 THEY WITH THEIR SOFT HANDS AND THEIR BLUE EYES THE SIGHT OF A WOMAN SICKENS ME WHY I DON'T KILL EVERY WOMAN I SEE I DON'T KNOW
233-134440-0035 HALF FRIGHTENED AND YET FASCINATED BY THE LIGHT BURNING IN THE EYES OF THE HIDEOUS OLD MAN GEORGE WILLARD LISTENED AFIRE WITH CURIOSITY DARKNESS CAME ON AND HE LEANED FORWARD
233-134440-0036 WHEN IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS HE COULD NO LONGER SEE THE PURPLE BLOATED FACE AND THE BURNING EYES A CURIOUS FANCY CAME TO HIM WASH WILLIAMS TALKED IN LOW EVEN TONES
233-134440-0037 THAT MADE HIS WORDS SEEM THE MORE TERRIBLE IN THE DARKNESS THE YOUNG REPORTER FOUND HIMSELF IMAGINING THAT HE SAT ON THE RAILROAD TIES BESIDE A COMELY YOUNG MAN WITH BLACK HAIR AND BLACK SHINING EYES
233-134440-0038 THERE WAS SOMETHING ALMOST BEAUTIFUL IN THE VOICE OF WASH WILLIAMS THE HIDEOUS TELLING HIS STORY OF HATE THE TELEGRAPH OPERATOR OF WINESBURG SITTING IN THE DARKNESS ON THE RAILROAD TIES HAD BECOME A POET
233-134440-0039 HATRED HAD RAISED HIM TO THAT ELEVATION IT IS BECAUSE I SAW YOU KISSING THE LIPS OF THAT BELLE CARPENTER THAT I TELL YOU MY STORY HE SAID WHAT HAPPENED TO ME MAY NEXT HAPPEN TO YOU
233-134440-0040 ALREADY YOU MAY BE HAVING DREAMS IN YOUR HEAD
233-134440-0041 WASH WILLIAMS BEGAN TELLING THE STORY OF HIS MARRIED LIFE WITH THE TALL BLONDE GIRL WITH THE BLUE EYES WHOM HE HAD MET WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG OPERATOR AT DAYTON OHIO HERE AND THERE HIS STORY WAS TOUCHED WITH MOMENTS OF BEAUTY
233-134440-0042 INTERMINGLED WITH STRINGS OF VILE CURSES THE OPERATOR HAD MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF A DENTIST WHO WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THREE SISTERS ON HIS MARRIAGE DAY BECAUSE OF HIS ABILITY HE WAS PROMOTED TO A POSITION AS DISPATCHER
233-134440-0043 AT AN INCREASED SALARY AND SENT TO AN OFFICE AT COLUMBUS OHIO THERE HE SETTLED DOWN WITH HIS YOUNG WIFE AND BEGAN BUYING A HOUSE ON THE INSTALLMENT PLAN THE YOUNG TELEGRAPH OPERATOR WAS MADLY IN LOVE
233-134440-0044 WITH A KIND OF RELIGIOUS FERVOR HE HAD MANAGED TO GO THROUGH THE PITFALLS OF HIS YOUTH AND TO REMAIN VIRGINAL UNTIL AFTER HIS MARRIAGE HE MADE FOR GEORGE WILLARD A PICTURE OF HIS LIFE IN THE HOUSE AT COLUMBUS OHIO WITH THE YOUNG WIFE
233-134440-0045 IN THE GARDEN BACK OF OUR HOUSE WE PLANTED VEGETABLES HE SAID YOU KNOW PEAS AND CORN AND SUCH THINGS WE WENT TO COLUMBUS IN EARLY MARCH AND AS SOON AS THE DAYS BECAME WARM I WENT TO WORK IN THE GARDEN
233-134440-0046 WITH A SPADE I TURNED UP THE BLACK GROUND WHILE SHE RAN ABOUT
233-134440-0047 LATE IN APRIL CAME THE PLANTING IN THE LITTLE PATHS AMONG THE SEED BEDS SHE STOOD HOLDING A PAPER BAG IN HER HAND THE BAG WAS FILLED WITH SEEDS A FEW AT A TIME SHE HANDED ME THE SEEDS
233-134440-0048 FOR A MOMENT THERE WAS A CATCH IN THE VOICE OF THE MAN TALKING IN THE DARKNESS I LOVED HER HE SAID I DON'T CLAIM NOT TO BE A FOOL I LOVE HER YET THERE IN THE DUSK IN THE SPRING EVENING
233-134440-0049 I KISSED HER SHOES AND THE ANKLES ABOVE HER SHOES WHEN THE HEM OF HER GARMENT TOUCHED MY FACE I TREMBLED WHEN AFTER TWO YEARS OF THAT LIFE
233-134440-0050 OR HER I JUST SENT HER HOME TO HER MOTHER AND SAID NOTHING THERE WAS NOTHING TO SAY I HAD FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THE BANK AND I GAVE HER THAT I DIDN'T ASK HER REASONS
233-134440-0051 I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING WHEN SHE HAD GONE I CRIED LIKE A SILLY BOY PRETTY SOON I HAD A CHANCE TO SELL THE HOUSE AND I SENT THAT MONEY TO HER WASH WILLIAMS AND GEORGE WILLARD
233-134440-0052 AROSE FROM THE PILE OF RAILROAD TIES AND WALKED ALONG THE TRACKS TOWARD TOWN THE OPERATOR FINISHED HIS TALE QUICKLY BREATHLESSLY HER MOTHER SENT FOR ME HE SAID
233-134440-0053 SHE WROTE ME A LETTER AND ASKED ME TO COME TO THEIR HOUSE AT DAYTON WHEN I GOT THERE IT WAS EVENING ABOUT THIS TIME WASH WILLIAMS VOICE ROSE TO A HALF SCREAM
233-134440-0054 I SAT IN THE PARLOR OF THAT HOUSE TWO HOURS HER MOTHER TOOK ME IN THERE AND LEFT ME THEIR HOUSE WAS STYLISH THEY WERE WHAT IS CALLED RESPECTABLE PEOPLE THERE WERE PLUSH CHAIRS AND A COUCH IN THE ROOM
233-134440-0055 I WAS TREMBLING ALL OVER I HATED THE MEN I THOUGHT HAD WRONGED HER I WAS SICK OF LIVING ALONE AND WANTED HER BACK THE LONGER I WAITED THE MORE RAW AND TENDER I BECAME I THOUGHT THAT IF SHE CAME IN AND JUST
233-134440-0056 TOUCHED ME WITH HER HAND I WOULD PERHAPS FAINT AWAY I ACHED TO FORGIVE AND FORGET WASH WILLIAMS STOPPED AND STOOD STARING AT GEORGE WILLARD
233-134440-0057 AGAIN THE MAN'S VOICE BECAME SOFT AND LOW SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM NAKED HE WENT ON HER MOTHER DID THAT WHILE I SAT THERE SHE WAS TAKING THE GIRL'S CLOTHES OFF PERHAPS COAXING HER TO DO IT
233-134440-0058 FIRST I HEARD VOICES AT THE DOOR THAT LED INTO A LITTLE HALLWAY
233-134440-0059 THE GIRL WAS ASHAMED AND STOOD PERFECTLY STILL STARING AT THE FLOOR THE MOTHER DIDN'T COME INTO THE ROOM WHEN SHE HAD PUSHED THE GIRL IN THROUGH THE DOOR SHE STOOD IN THE HALLWAY WAITING HOPING WE WOULD WELL
233-134440-0060 YOU SEE WAITING GEORGE WILLARD AND THE TELEGRAPH OPERATOR CAME INTO THE MAIN STREET OF WINESBURG THE LIGHTS FROM THE STORE WINDOWS LAY BRIGHT AND SHINING ON THE SIDEWALKS PEOPLE MOVED ABOUT LAUGHING AND TALKING
233-134440-0061 THE YOUNG REPORTER FELT ILL AND WEAK IN IMAGINATION HE ALSO BECAME OLD AND SHAPELESS I DIDN'T GET THE MOTHER KILLED SAID WASH WILLIAMS STARING UP AND DOWN THE STREET I STRUCK HER ONCE WITH A CHAIR
233-134440-0062 AND THEN THE NEIGHBORS CAME IN AND TOOK IT AWAY
233-155990-0000 THE PEACE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS
233-155990-0001 THERE CAN BE NO NOBLER CAUSE FOR WHICH TO WORK THAN THE PEACE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HIGH HONOR IS DUE THOSE SERENE AND LOFTY SOULS WHO WITH WISDOM AND COURAGE
233-155990-0002 WITH HIGH IDEALISM TEMPERED BY SANE FACING OF THE ACTUAL FACTS OF LIFE HAVE STRIVEN TO BRING NEARER THE DAY WHEN ARMED STRIFE BETWEEN NATION AND NATION BETWEEN CLASS AND CLASS
233-155990-0003 BETWEEN MAN AND MAN SHALL END THROUGHOUT THE WORLD BECAUSE ALL THIS IS TRUE IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THERE ARE NO MEN MORE IGNOBLE OR MORE FOOLISH NO MEN WHOSE ACTIONS ARE FRAUGHT WITH GREATER POSSIBILITY OF MISCHIEF
233-155990-0004 TO THEIR COUNTRY AND TO MANKIND THAN THOSE WHO EXALT UNRIGHTEOUS PEACE AS BETTER THAN RIGHTEOUS WAR THE MEN WHO HAVE STOOD HIGHEST IN OUR HISTORY AS IN THE HISTORY OF ALL COUNTRIES ARE THOSE WHO SCORNED INJUSTICE
233-155990-0005 WHO WERE INCAPABLE OF OPPRESSING THE WEAK OR OF PERMITTING THEIR COUNTRY WITH THEIR CONSENT TO OPPRESS THE WEAK BUT WHO DID NOT HESITATE TO DRAW THE SWORD WHEN TO LEAVE IT UNDRAWN MEANT INABILITY TO ARREST TRIUMPHANT WRONG
233-155990-0006 YET EVERY MAN IN ACTIVE AFFAIRS WHO ALSO READS ABOUT THE PAST GROWS BY BITTER EXPERIENCE TO REALIZE THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF MEN NOT ONLY AMONG THOSE WHO MEAN ILL BUT AMONG THOSE WHO MEAN WELL
233-155990-0007 WHO ARE READY ENOUGH TO PRAISE WHAT WAS DONE IN THE PAST AND YET ARE INCAPABLE OF PROFITING BY IT WHEN FACED BY THE NEEDS OF THE PRESENT DURING OUR GENERATION THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN PECULIARLY THE CASE AMONG THE MEN
233-155990-0008 WHO HAVE BECOME OBSESSED WITH THE IDEA OF OBTAINING UNIVERSAL PEACE BY SOME CHEAP PATENT PANACEA THERE HAS BEEN A REAL AND SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH
233-155990-0009 IN THE FEELING FOR INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND JUSTICE AMONG THE GREAT CIVILIZED NATIONS DURING THE PAST THREESCORE OR FOURSCORE YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A REAL GROWTH OF RECOGNITION OF THE FACT
233-155990-0010 AND THAT IN MOST CASES WAR IS AN EVIL METHOD OF SETTLING INTERNATIONAL DIFFICULTIES BUT AS YET THERE HAS BEEN ONLY A RUDIMENTARY BEGINNING OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNALS OF JUSTICE
233-155990-0011 AND THERE HAS BEEN NO DEVELOPMENT AT ALL OF ANY INTERNATIONAL POLICE POWER NOW AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID THE WHOLE FABRIC OF MUNICIPAL LAW OF LAW WITHIN EACH NATION
233-155990-0012 RESTS ULTIMATELY UPON THE JUDGE AND THE POLICEMAN AND THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF THE POLICEMAN AND THE ALMOST COMPLETE ABSENCE OF THE JUDGE IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS PREVENTS THERE BEING AS YET ANY REAL HOMOLOGY
233-155990-0013 BETWEEN MUNICIPAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW MOREOVER THE QUESTIONS WHICH SOMETIMES INVOLVE NATIONS IN WAR ARE FAR MORE DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX THAN ANY QUESTIONS THAT AFFECT MERELY INDIVIDUALS
233-155990-0014 ALMOST EVERY GREAT NATION HAS INHERITED CERTAIN QUESTIONS EITHER WITH OTHER NATIONS OR WITH SECTIONS OF ITS OWN PEOPLE WHICH IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CIVILIZATION TO DECIDE
233-155990-0015 AS MATTERS BETWEEN PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS CAN BE DECIDED DURING THE LAST CENTURY AT LEAST HALF OF THE WARS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUGHT HAVE BEEN CIVIL AND NOT FOREIGN WARS THERE ARE BIG AND POWERFUL NATIONS WHICH HABITUALLY COMMIT EITHER UPON OTHER NATIONS
233-155990-0016 OR UPON SECTIONS OF THEIR OWN PEOPLE WRONGS SO OUTRAGEOUS AS TO JUSTIFY EVEN THE MOST PEACEFUL PERSONS IN GOING TO WAR THERE ARE ALSO WEAK NATIONS SO UTTERLY INCOMPETENT
233-155990-0017 EITHER TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF FOREIGNERS AGAINST THEIR OWN CITIZENS OR TO PROTECT THEIR OWN CITIZENS AGAINST FOREIGNERS THAT IT BECOMES A MATTER OF SHEER DUTY FOR SOME OUTSIDE POWER TO INTERFERE IN CONNECTION WITH THEM
233-155990-0018 AS YET IN NEITHER CASE IS THERE ANY EFFICIENT METHOD OF GETTING INTERNATIONAL ACTION AND IF JOINT ACTION BY SEVERAL POWERS IS SECURED THE RESULT IS USUALLY CONSIDERABLY WORSE THAN IF ONLY ONE POWER INTERFERED
233-155990-0019 THE WORST INFAMIES OF MODERN TIMES SUCH AFFAIRS AS THE MASSACRES OF THE ARMENIANS BY THE TURKS FOR INSTANCE HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED IN A TIME OF NOMINALLY PROFOUND INTERNATIONAL PEACE
233-155990-0020 WHEN THERE HAS BEEN A CONCERT OF BIG POWERS TO PREVENT THE BREAKING OF THIS PEACE ALTHOUGH ONLY BY BREAKING IT COULD THE OUTRAGES BE STOPPED BE IT REMEMBERED THAT THE PEOPLES WHO SUFFERED BY THESE HIDEOUS MASSACRES WHO SAW THEIR WOMEN VIOLATED
233-155990-0021 OTHERWISE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASSACRED FOR IF THE JEWS IN RUSSIA AND THE ARMENIANS IN TURKEY HAD BEEN ARMED AND HAD BEEN EFFICIENT IN THE USE OF THEIR ARMS NO MOB WOULD HAVE MEDDLED WITH THEM
233-155990-0022 YET AMIABLE BUT FATUOUS PERSONS WITH ALL THESE FACTS BEFORE THEIR EYES PASS RESOLUTIONS DEMANDING UNIVERSAL ARBITRATION FOR EVERYTHING
233-155990-0023 AND THEIR ABANDONMENT OF THEIR ARMED FORCES OR ELSE THEY WRITE WELL MEANING SOLEMN LITTLE BOOKS OR PAMPHLETS OR EDITORIALS AND ARTICLES IN MAGAZINES OR NEWSPAPERS TO SHOW
233-155990-0024 BECAUSE IT IS EXPENSIVE THIS IS PRECISELY LIKE ARGUING THAT WE SHOULD DISBAND THE POLICE AND DEVOTE OUR SOLE ATTENTION TO PERSUADING CRIMINALS
233-155990-0025 SUPPOSE THAT BURGLARY HIGHWAY ROBBERY AND WHITE SLAVERY ARE PROFITABLE IT IS ALMOST USELESS TO ATTEMPT TO ARGUE WITH THESE WELL INTENTIONED PERSONS BECAUSE THEY ARE SUFFERING UNDER AN OBSESSION AND ARE NOT OPEN TO REASON
233-155990-0026 THEY GO WRONG AT THE OUTSET FOR THEY LAY ALL THE EMPHASIS ON PEACE AND NONE AT ALL ON RIGHTEOUSNESS THEY ARE NOT ALL OF THEM PHYSICALLY TIMID MEN BUT THEY ARE USUALLY MEN
233-155990-0027 FROM INSULTING OR WRONGING THE PEOPLE OF OTHER NATIONS BUT THEY ALWAYS ARDENTLY ADVOCATE THAT WE IN OUR TURN SHALL TAMELY SUBMIT TO WRONG AND INSULT FROM OTHER NATIONS
233-155990-0028 AS AMERICANS THEIR FOLLY IS PECULIARLY SCANDALOUS BECAUSE IF THE PRINCIPLES THEY NOW UPHOLD ARE RIGHT IT MEANS THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAT AMERICANS SHOULD NEVER HAVE ACHIEVED THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND BETTER THAT
233-155990-0029 IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE THEY SHOULD HAVE PEACEFULLY SUBMITTED TO SEEING THEIR COUNTRY SPLIT INTO HALF A DOZEN JANGLING CONFEDERACIES AND SLAVERY MADE PERPETUAL IF UNWILLING TO LEARN FROM THEIR OWN HISTORY
233-155990-0030 LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHINA AND JAPAN CHINA HAS NEITHER A FLEET NOR AN EFFICIENT ARMY IT IS A HUGE CIVILIZED EMPIRE ONE OF THE MOST POPULOUS ON THE GLOBE AND IT HAS BEEN THE HELPLESS PREY
233-155990-0031 OF OUTSIDERS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT POSSESS THE POWER TO FIGHT JAPAN STANDS ON A FOOTING OF EQUALITY WITH EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN NATIONS BECAUSE IT DOES POSSESS THIS POWER CHINA NOW SEES JAPAN
233-155990-0032 RUSSIA GERMANY ENGLAND AND FRANCE IN POSSESSION OF FRAGMENTS OF HER EMPIRE AND HAS TWICE WITHIN THE LIFETIME OF THE PRESENT GENERATION SEEN HER CAPITAL IN THE HANDS OF ALLIED INVADERS BECAUSE SHE IN VERY FACT
233-155990-0033 REALIZES THE IDEALS OF THE PERSONS WHO WISH THE UNITED STATES TO DISARM AND THEN TRUST THAT OUR HELPLESSNESS WILL SECURE US A CONTEMPTUOUS IMMUNITY FROM ATTACK BY OUTSIDE NATIONS
233-155990-0034 THE CHIEF TROUBLE COMES FROM THE ENTIRE INABILITY OF THESE WORTHY PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE DEMANDING THINGS THAT ARE MUTUALLY INCOMPATIBLE WHEN THEY DEMAND PEACE AT ANY PRICE AND ALSO JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS
233-155990-0035 I REMEMBER ONE REPRESENTATIVE OF THEIR NUMBER WHO USED TO WRITE LITTLE SONNETS ON BEHALF OF THE MAHDI AND THE SUDANESE THESE SONNETS SETTING FORTH THE NEED THAT THE SUDAN SHOULD BE BOTH INDEPENDENT AND PEACEFUL
233-155990-0036 AS A MATTER OF FACT THE SUDAN VALUED INDEPENDENCE ONLY BECAUSE IT DESIRED TO WAR AGAINST ALL CHRISTIANS AND TO CARRY ON AN UNLIMITED SLAVE TRADE
233-155990-0037 UNDER THE MAHDI FOR A DOZEN YEARS AND DURING THOSE DOZEN YEARS THE BIGOTRY TYRANNY AND CRUEL RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE WERE SUCH AS FLOURISHED IN THE SEVENTH CENTURY AND IN SPITE OF SYSTEMATIC SLAVE RAIDS
233-155990-0038 THE POPULATION DECREASED BY NEARLY TWO THIRDS AND PRACTICALLY ALL THE CHILDREN DIED PEACE CAME WELL BEING CAME FREEDOM FROM RAPE AND MURDER AND TORTURE AND HIGHWAY ROBBERY AND EVERY BRUTAL GRATIFICATION OF LUST AND GREED CAME
233-155990-0039 ONLY WHEN THE SUDAN LOST ITS INDEPENDENCE AND PASSED UNDER ENGLISH RULE YET THIS WELL MEANING LITTLE SONNETEER SINCERELY FELT THAT HIS VERSES WERE ISSUED IN THE CAUSE OF HUMANITY
233-155990-0040 LOOKING BACK FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF A SCORE OF YEARS PROBABLY EVERY ONE WILL AGREE THAT HE WAS AN ABSURD PERSON BUT HE WAS NOT ONE WHIT MORE ABSURD THAN MOST OF THE MORE PROMINENT PERSONS WHO ADVOCATE DISARMAMENT BY THE UNITED STATES
233-155990-0041 THE CESSATION OF UP BUILDING THE NAVY AND THE PROMISE TO AGREE TO ARBITRATE ALL MATTERS INCLUDING THOSE AFFECTING OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS AND HONOR WITH ALL FOREIGN NATIONS THESE PERSONS WOULD DO NO HARM
233-155990-0042 IF THEY AFFECTED ONLY THEMSELVES MANY OF THEM ARE IN THE ORDINARY RELATIONS OF LIFE GOOD CITIZENS THEY ARE EXACTLY LIKE THE OTHER GOOD CITIZENS WHO BELIEVE THAT ENFORCED UNIVERSAL VEGETARIANISM OR ANTI VACCINATION
233-155990-0043 IS THE PANACEA FOR ALL ILLS BUT IN THEIR PARTICULAR CASE THEY ARE ABLE TO DO HARM BECAUSE THEY AFFECT OUR RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN POWERS SO THAT OTHER MEN PAY THE DEBT WHICH THEY THEMSELVES HAVE REALLY INCURRED
233-155990-0044 IT IS THE FOOLISH PEACE AT ANY PRICE PERSONS WHO TRY TO PERSUADE OUR PEOPLE TO MAKE UNWISE AND IMPROPER TREATIES OR TO STOP BUILDING UP THE NAVY BUT IF TROUBLE COMES AND THE TREATIES ARE REPUDIATED
233-155990-0045 IT IS NOT THESE PEOPLE WHO WILL PAY ANYTHING THEY WILL STAY AT HOME IN SAFETY AND LEAVE BRAVE MEN TO PAY IN BLOOD AND HONEST MEN TO PAY IN SHAME FOR THEIR FOLLY THE TROUBLE IS THAT OUR POLICY IS APT TO GO IN ZIGZAGS
233-155990-0046 BECAUSE DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF OUR PEOPLE EXERCISE AT DIFFERENT TIMES UNEQUAL PRESSURE ON OUR GOVERNMENT ONE CLASS OF OUR CITIZENS CLAMORS FOR TREATIES IMPOSSIBLE OF FULFILMENT AND IMPROPER TO FULFIL
2384-152900-0000 SO FAR I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH OUR GENERAL OUTFIT AND SHALL NOW PASS TO THE SPECIAL EQUIPMENT OF THE SHORE PARTY THE HUT WE TOOK OUT WAS BUILT ON MY PROPERTY ON BUNDEFJORD SO THAT I WAS ABLE TO WATCH THE WORK AS IT PROGRESSED
2384-152900-0001 IT WAS BUILT BY THE BROTHERS HANS AND JOERGEN STUBBERUD AND WAS THROUGHOUT A SPLENDID PIECE OF WORK WHICH DID HONOUR TO BOTH THE BROTHERS THE MATERIALS PROVED EXCELLENT IN EVERY WAY THE HUT WAS TWENTY SIX FEET LONG BY THIRTEEN FEET WIDE
2384-152900-0002 ITS HEIGHT FROM THE FLOOR TO THE RIDGE OF THE ROOF WAS ABOUT TWELVE FEET IT WAS BUILT AS AN ORDINARY NORWEGIAN HOUSE WITH POINTED GABLE AND HAD TWO ROOMS ONE OF THESE WAS NINETEEN AND A HALF FEET LONG AND WAS TO SERVE AS OUR DORMITORY DINING ROOM AND SITTING ROOM
2384-152900-0003 THE OTHER ROOM WAS SIX AND A HALF FEET LONG AND WAS TO BE LINDSTROEM'S KITCHEN FROM THE KITCHEN A DOUBLE TRAP DOOR LED TO THE LOFT WHERE WE INTENDED TO KEEP A QUANTITY OF PROVISIONS AND OUTFIT THE WALLS CONSISTED OF THREE INCH PLANKS
2384-152900-0004 FOR INSULATION WE USED CELLULOSE PULP THE FLOOR AND THE CEILING BETWEEN THE ROOMS AND THE LOFT WERE DOUBLE
2384-152900-0005 THE DOORS WERE EXTRAORDINARILY THICK AND STRONG AND FITTED INTO OBLIQUE GROOVES SO THAT THEY CLOSED VERY TIGHTLY THERE WERE TWO WINDOWS A TRIPLE ONE IN THE END WALL OF THE MAIN ROOM AND A DOUBLE ONE IN THE KITCHEN
2384-152900-0006 FOR THE COVERING OF THE ROOF WE TOOK OUT ROOFING PAPER AND FOR THE FLOOR LINOLEUM IN THE MAIN ROOM THERE WERE TWO AIR PIPES
2384-152900-0007 THERE WERE BUNKS FOR TEN MEN IN TWO STAGES SIX ON ONE WALL AND FOUR ON THE OTHER THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOM CONSISTED OF A TABLE A STOOL FOR EACH MAN AND A LUX LAMP
2384-152900-0008 THE HUT WAS TARRED SEVERAL TIMES AND EVERY PART WAS CAREFULLY MARKED SO THAT IT COULD EASILY BE SET UP TO FASTEN IT TO THE GROUND AND PREVENT THE ANTARCTIC STORMS FROM BLOWING IT AWAY I HAD STRONG EYEBOLTS SCREWED INTO EACH END OF THE ROOF RIDGE
2384-152900-0009 AND THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE ROOF WE CARRIED SIX STRONG EYEBOLTS A METRE LONG TO BE RAMMED INTO THE BARRIER BETWEEN THESE BOLTS AND THOSE ON THE HUT STEEL WIRES WERE TO BE STRETCHED WHICH COULD BE DRAWN QUITE TIGHT WE ALSO HAD TWO SPARE CABLES
2384-152900-0010 WHICH COULD BE STRETCHED OVER THE ROOF IF THE GALES WERE TOO SEVERE THE TWO VENTILATING PIPES AND THE CHIMNEY WERE SECURED OUTSIDE WITH STRONG STAYS AS WILL BE SEEN EVERY PRECAUTION WAS TAKEN TO MAKE THE HUT WARM AND COMFORTABLE
2384-152900-0011 AND TO HOLD IT DOWN ON THE GROUND WE ALSO TOOK ON BOARD A QUANTITY OF LOOSE TIMBER BOARDS AND PLANKS BESIDES THE HUT WE TOOK WITH US FIFTEEN TENTS FOR SIXTEEN MEN EACH TEN OF THESE WERE OLD BUT GOOD
2384-152900-0012 THEY WERE SERVED OUT TO US FROM THE NAVAL STORES THE OTHER FIVE WERE NEW AND WE BOUGHT THEM FROM THE ARMY DEPOTS IT WAS OUR INTENTION TO USE THE TENTS AS TEMPORARY HOUSES THEY WERE EASILY AND QUICKLY SET UP AND WERE STRONG AND WARM
2384-152900-0013 ON THE VOYAGE TO THE SOUTH ROENNE SEWED NEW FLOORS OF GOOD STRONG CANVAS TO THE FIVE NEW TENTS ALL CASES OF PROVISIONS THAT WERE INTENDED FOR WINTER QUARTERS WERE MARKED AND STOWED SEPARATELY IN THE HOLD
2384-152900-0014 WE HAD TEN SLEDGES MADE BY A FIRM OF SPORTING OUTFITTERS IN CHRISTIANIA THEY WERE BUILT LIKE THE OLD NANSEN SLEDGES BUT RATHER BROADER AND WERE TWELVE FEET LONG THE RUNNERS WERE OF THE BEST AMERICAN HICKORY SHOD WITH STEEL
2384-152900-0015 THE OTHER PARTS WERE OF GOOD TOUGH NORWEGIAN ASH TO EACH SLEDGE BELONGED A PAIR OF SPARE RUNNERS WHICH COULD EASILY BE FITTED UNDERNEATH BY MEANS OF CLAMPS AND AS EASILY REMOVED WHEN NOT REQUIRED
2384-152900-0016 THE STEEL SHOEING OF THE RUNNERS WAS WELL COATED WITH RED LEAD AND THE SPARE RUNNERS WITH TAR THESE SLEDGES WERE EXTREMELY STRONGLY BUILT AND COULD STAND ALL KINDS OF WORK ON EVERY SORT OF SURFACE AT THAT TIME
2384-152900-0017 I DID NOT KNOW THE CONDITIONS ON THE BARRIER AS I AFTERWARDS CAME TO KNOW THEM OF COURSE THESE SLEDGES WERE VERY HEAVY WE TOOK TWENTY PAIRS OF SKI ALL OF THE FINEST HICKORY THEY WERE EIGHT FEET LONG AND PROPORTIONATELY NARROW
2384-152900-0018 I CHOSE THEM OF THIS LENGTH WITH A VIEW TO BEING ABLE TO CROSS THE NUMEROUS CRACKS IN THE GLACIERS THE GREATER THE SURFACE OVER WHICH THE WEIGHT COULD BE DISTRIBUTED THE BETTER PROSPECT WE SHOULD HAVE OF SLIPPING OVER THE SNOW BRIDGES
2384-152900-0019 WE HAD FORTY SKI POLES WITH EBONITE POINTS THE SKI BINDINGS WERE A COMBINATION OF THE HUITFELDT AND THE HOEYER ELLEFSEN BINDINGS WE ALSO HAD QUANTITIES OF LOOSE STRAPS
2384-152900-0020 WE HAD SIX THREE MAN TENTS ALL MADE IN THE NAVY WORKSHOPS THE WORKMANSHIP COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER THEY WERE THE STRONGEST AND MOST PRACTICAL TENTS THAT HAVE EVER BEEN USED THEY WERE MADE OF THE CLOSEST CANVAS WITH THE FLOOR IN ONE PIECE
2384-152900-0021 ONE MAN WAS SUFFICIENT TO SET UP THE TENT IN THE STIFFEST BREEZE I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE FEWER POLES A TENT HAS THE EASIER IT IS TO SET UP WHICH SEEMS QUITE NATURAL THESE TENTS HAVE ONLY ONE POLE
2384-152900-0022 HOW OFTEN ONE READS IN NARRATIVES OF POLAR TRAVEL THAT IT TOOK SUCH AND SUCH A TIME OFTEN HOURS TO SET UP THE TENT AND THEN WHEN AT LAST IT WAS UP ONE LAY EXPECTING IT TO BE BLOWN DOWN AT ANY MOMENT
2384-152900-0023 THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF THIS WITH OUR TENTS THEY WERE UP IN A TWINKLING AND STOOD AGAINST ALL KINDS OF WIND WE COULD LIE SECURELY IN OUR SLEEPING BAGS AND LET IT BLOW THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE DOOR WAS ON THE USUAL SACK PRINCIPLE
2384-152900-0024 WHICH CAME FROM THE ESTATE OF PALSGAARD IN JUTLAND AND THE MATERIAL DID ALL IT PROMISED THESE CASES WERE ONE FOOT SQUARE AND FIFTEEN AND A HALF INCHES HIGH
2384-152900-0025 THEY HAD ONLY A LITTLE ROUND OPENING ON THE TOP CLOSED WITH AN ALUMINIUM LID WHICH FITTED EXACTLY LIKE THE LID OF A MILK CAN LARGE LIDS WEAKEN THE CASES AND I HAD THEREFORE CHOSEN THIS FORM WE DID NOT HAVE TO THROW OFF THE LASHING OF THE CASE TO GET THE LID OFF
2384-152900-0026 AND THIS IS A VERY GREAT ADVANTAGE WE COULD ALWAYS GET AT IT A CASE WITH A LARGE LID COVERED BY THE LASHING GIVES CONSTANT TROUBLE THE WHOLE LASHING HAS TO BE UNDONE FOR EVERY LITTLE THING ONE WANTS OUT OF THE CASE THIS IS NOT ALWAYS CONVENIENT
2384-152900-0027 IF ONE IS TIRED AND SLACK IT MAY SOMETIMES HAPPEN THAT ONE WILL PUT OFF TILL TO MORROW WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE TO DAY ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS BITTERLY COLD
2384-152900-0028 THE HANDIER ONE'S SLEDGING OUTFIT THE SOONER ONE GETS INTO THE TENT AND TO REST AND THAT IS NO SMALL CONSIDERATION ON A LONG JOURNEY OUR OUTFIT OF CLOTHING WAS ABUNDANT AND MORE COMPLETE I SUPPOSE THAN THAT OF ANY FORMER POLAR EXPEDITION
2384-152900-0029 WE MAY DIVIDE IT INTO TWO CLASSES THE OUTFIT FOR SPECIALLY LOW TEMPERATURES AND THAT FOR MORE MODERATE TEMPERATURES IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT NO ONE HAD YET WINTERED ON THE BARRIER SO WE HAD TO BE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING
2384-152900-0030 IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GRAPPLE WITH ANY DEGREE OF COLD WE WERE SUPPLIED WITH THE RICHEST ASSORTMENT OF REINDEER SKIN CLOTHING WE HAD IT SPECIALLY THICK MEDIUM AND QUITE LIGHT IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET THESE SKIN CLOTHES PREPARED
2384-152900-0031 FIRST THE REINDEER SKINS HAD TO BE BOUGHT IN A RAW STATE
2384-152900-0032 LET ME TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF THANKING THIS MAN FOR THE MANY AND GREAT SERVICES HE HAS RENDERED ME NOT ONLY DURING MY PREPARATIONS FOR THE THIRD VOYAGE OF THE FRAM
2384-152900-0033 WITH HIS HELP I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING THINGS THAT I SHOULD OTHERWISE NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET HE SHRANK FROM NO AMOUNT OF WORK BUT WENT ON TILL HE HAD FOUND WHAT I WANTED
2384-152900-0034 THIS TIME HE PROCURED NEARLY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY GOOD REINDEER SKINS DRESSED BY THE LAPPS AND SENT THEM TO CHRISTIANIA HERE I HAD GREAT TROUBLE IN FINDING A MAN WHO COULD SEW SKINS BUT AT LAST I FOUND ONE
2384-152900-0035 WE THEN WENT TO WORK TO MAKE CLOTHES AFTER THE PATTERN OF THE NETCHELLI ESKIMO AND THE SEWING WENT ON EARLY AND LATE THICK ANORAKS AND THIN ONES HEAVY BREECHES AND LIGHT WINTER STOCKINGS AND SUMMER STOCKINGS
2384-152900-0036 WE ALSO HAD A DOZEN THIN SLEEPING BAGS WHICH I THOUGHT OF USING INSIDE THE BIG THICK ONES IF THE COLD SHOULD BE TOO SEVERE EVERYTHING WAS FINISHED BUT NOT UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT THE OUTER SLEEPING BAGS WERE MADE BY MISTER BRANDT FURRIER OF BERGEN
2384-152900-0037 AND THEY WERE SO EXCELLENT BOTH IN MATERIAL AND MAKING UP THAT NO ONE IN THE WORLD COULD HAVE DONE BETTER IT WAS A MODEL PIECE OF WORK TO SAVE THIS OUTER SLEEPING BAG WE HAD IT PROVIDED WITH A COVER OF THE LIGHTEST CANVAS
2384-152900-0038 WHICH WAS A GOOD DEAL LONGER THAN THE BAG ITSELF IT WAS EASY TO TIE THE END OF THE COVER TOGETHER LIKE THE MOUTH OF THE SACK AND THIS KEPT THE SNOW OUT OF THE BAG DURING THE DAY'S MARCH
2384-152900-0039 IN THIS WAY WE ALWAYS KEPT OURSELVES FREE FROM THE ANNOYANCE OF DRIFTING SNOW WE ATTACHED GREAT IMPORTANCE TO HAVING THE BAGS MADE OF THE VERY BEST SORT OF SKIN AND TOOK CARE THAT THE THIN SKIN OF THE BELLY WAS REMOVED
2384-152900-0040 AS OF COURSE THE COLD PENETRATES MORE EASILY THROUGH THE THIN SKIN AND GIVES RISE TO DAMPNESS IN THE FORM OF RIME ON MEETING THE WARMTH OF THE BODY THESE THIN PATCHES REMAIN DAMP WHENEVER ONE IS IN THE BAG AND IN A SHORT TIME THEY LOSE THEIR HAIR
2384-152900-0041 THE DAMP SPREADS LIKE DECAY IN WOOD AND CONTINUALLY ATTACKS THE SURROUNDING SKIN WITH THE RESULT THAT ONE FINE DAY YOU FIND YOURSELF WITH A HAIRLESS SLEEPING BAG
2384-152900-0042 OUR BURBERRY WIND CLOTHES WERE MADE IN THE FORM OF ANORAK BLOUSE AND TROUSERS BOTH VERY ROOMY THE OTHERS CONSISTED OF TROUSERS AND JACKET WITH HOOD OUR MITS WERE FOR THE MOST PART SUCH AS ONE CAN BUY IN ANY SHOP
2384-152900-0043 WE WANTED NOTHING ELSE IN AND AROUND WINTER QUARTERS OUTSIDE THE MITS WE WORE AN OUTER COVERING OF WINDPROOF MATERIAL SO AS NOT TO WEAR THEM OUT TOO QUICKLY THESE MITS ARE NOT VERY STRONG THOUGH THEY ARE GOOD AND WARM
2384-152900-0044 BESIDES THESE WE HAD TEN PAIRS OF ORDINARY KID MITS WHICH WERE BOUGHT AT A GLOVE SHOP IN CHRISTIANIA AND WERE PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO WEAR OUT I WORE MINE FROM FRAMHEIM TO THE POLE AND BACK AGAIN AND AFTERWARDS ON THE VOYAGE TO TASMANIA
2384-152900-0045 THE LINING OF COURSE WAS TORN IN PLACES BUT THE SEAMS OF THE MITS WERE JUST AS PERFECT AS THE DAY I BOUGHT THEM TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT I WENT ON SKI THE WHOLE WAY AND USED TWO POLES IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MITS WERE STRONGLY MADE
2384-152900-0046 WE ALSO HAD A NUMBER OF WOOLLEN GLOVES WHICH CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE OTHERS GREATLY PRIZED FOR MYSELF I WAS NEVER ABLE TO WEAR SUCH THINGS THEY SIMPLY FREEZE THE FINGERS OFF ME BUT MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL IS THE COVERING OF THE FEET
2384-152900-0047 FOR THE FEET ARE THE MOST EXPOSED MEMBERS AND THE MOST DIFFICULT TO PROTECT ONE CAN LOOK AFTER THE HANDS
2384-152900-0048 AND THIS IS A SUFFICIENTLY TROUBLESOME PIECE OF WORK TO MAKE ONE DISINCLINED TO UNDO IT AGAIN UNTIL ONE IS TURNING IN THEY CANNOT BE SEEN IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY AND ONE HAS TO DEPEND ENTIRELY ON FEELING BUT FEELING IN THIS CASE OFTEN PLAYS CURIOUS TRICKS
2384-152900-0049 FOR IF THEY HAD KNOWN IT THEY COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE LET IT GO SO FAR THE FACT IS THAT IN THIS CASE SENSATION IS A SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL GUIDE FOR THE FEET LOSE ALL SENSATION
2384-152900-0050 IT IS TRUE THAT THERE IS A TRANSITIONAL STAGE WHEN ONE FEELS THE COLD SMARTING IN ONE'S TOES AND TRIES TO GET RID OF IT BY STAMPING THE FEET AS A RULE THIS IS SUCCESSFUL THE WARMTH RETURNS OR THE CIRCULATION IS RESTORED
2384-152900-0051 BUT IT OCCASIONALLY HAPPENS THAT SENSATION IS LOST AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THESE PRECAUTIONS ARE TAKEN AND THEN ONE MUST BE AN OLD HAND TO KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED MANY MEN CONCLUDE THAT AS THEY NO LONGER FEEL THE UNPLEASANT SMARTING SENSATION ALL IS WELL
2384-152900-0052 AND AT THE EVENING INSPECTION A FROZEN FOOT OF TALLOW LIKE APPEARANCE PRESENTS ITSELF AN EVENT OF THIS KIND MAY RUIN THE MOST ELABORATELY PREPARED ENTERPRISE AND IT IS THEREFORE ADVISABLE IN THE MATTER OF FEET
2384-152900-0053 TO CARRY ONE'S CAUTION TO LENGTHS WHICH MAY SEEM RIDICULOUS NOW IT IS A FACT THAT IF ONE CAN WEAR SOFT FOOT GEAR EXCLUSIVELY THE RISK OF FROST BITE IS FAR LESS THAN IF ONE IS COMPELLED TO WEAR STIFF BOOTS IN SOFT FOOT GEAR OF COURSE
2384-152900-0054 THE FOOT CAN MOVE FAR MORE EASILY AND KEEP WARM BUT WE WERE TO TAKE SKI AND TO GET FULL USE OUT OF THEM SO THAT IN ANY CASE WE HAD TO HAVE A STIFF SOLE FOR THE SAKE OF THE BINDINGS IT IS OF NO USE TO HAVE A GOOD BINDING UNLESS YOU CAN USE IT IN THE RIGHT WAY
2384-152900-0055 IN MY OPINION ON A LONG JOURNEY SUCH AS THAT WE HAD BEFORE US THE SKI MUST BE PERFECTLY STEADY I DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING THAT TIRES ME MORE THAN A BAD FASTENING THAT IS ONE THAT ALLOWS THE FOOT TO SHIFT IN THE BINDING
2384-152900-0056 I WANT THE SKI TO BE A PART OF ONESELF SO THAT ONE ALWAYS HAS FULL COMMAND OF THEM I HAVE TRIED MANY PATENTS FOR I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AFRAID OF A STIFF FASTENING IN COLD TEMPERATURES BUT ALL THESE PATENTS WITHOUT EXCEPTION ARE WORTHLESS IN THE LONG RUN
2384-152900-0057 I DECIDED THIS TIME TO TRY A COMBINATION OF STIFF AND SOFT FOOT GEAR SO THAT WE COULD USE THE SPLENDID HUITFELDT HOEYER ELLEFSEN BINDINGS BUT THIS WAS NO EASY MATTER OF OUR WHOLE OUTFIT NOTHING CAUSED ME MORE WORRY
2384-152900-0058 OR GAVE US ALL MORE WORK IN THE COURSE OF THE EXPEDITION THAN THE STIFF OUTER COVERING WHICH WE HAD TO HAVE BUT WE SOLVED THE PROBLEM AT LAST I APPLIED TO ONE OF THE LEADING MAKERS OF SKI BOOTS IN CHRISTIANIA AND EXPLAINED THE DIFFICULTY TO HIM
2384-152900-0059 FORTUNATELY I HAD FOUND A MAN WHO WAS EVIDENTLY INTERESTED IN THE QUESTION WE AGREED THAT HE SHOULD MAKE A SAMPLE PAIR AFTER THE PATTERN OF SKI BOOTS THE SOLE WAS TO BE THICK AND STIFF FOR WE HAD TO BE PREPARED TO USE CRAMPONS BUT THE UPPERS AS SOFT AS POSSIBLE
2384-152900-0060 IN ORDER TO AVOID LEATHER WHICH USUALLY BECOMES STIFF AND EASILY CRACKED IN THE COLD HE WAS TO USE A COMBINATION OF LEATHER AND THIN CANVAS FOR THE UPPERS LEATHER NEAREST THE SOLE AND CANVAS ABOVE IT THE MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN FROM MY FOOT
2384-152900-0061 WHICH IS NOT EXACTLY A CHILD'S FOOT WITH TWO PAIRS OF REINDEER SKIN STOCKINGS ON AND TEN PAIRS WERE MADE
2384-152900-0062 THEY WERE EXHIBITED IN THE BOOTMAKER'S WINDOWS I USED TO GO A LONG WAY ROUND TO AVOID COMING FACE TO FACE WITH THESE MONSTERS IN PUBLIC WE ARE ALL A TRIFLE VAIN AND DISLIKE HAVING OUR OWN SHORTCOMINGS SHOWN UP IN ELECTRIC LIGHT
2384-152900-0063 IF I HAD EVER CHERISHED ANY ILLUSIONS ON THE SUBJECT OF A DAINTY LITTLE FOOT I AM SURE THE LAST TRACE OF SUCH VANITY DIED OUT ON THE DAY I PASSED THE SHOEMAKER'S WINDOW AND BEHELD MY OWN BOOTS
2384-152900-0064 I NEVER WENT THAT WAY AGAIN UNTIL I WAS CERTAIN THAT THE EXHIBITION WAS CLOSED ONE THING IS CERTAIN THAT THE BOOTS WERE A FINE PIECE OF WORKMANSHIP WE SHALL HEAR LATER ON OF THE ALTERATIONS THEY HAD TO UNDERGO BEFORE WE AT LAST MADE THEM AS LARGE AS WE WANTED
2384-152900-0065 FOR THE GIANT BOOTS TURNED OUT MUCH TOO SMALL AMONG OTHER EQUIPMENT I MUST MENTION OUR EXCELLENT PRIMUS COOKING APPARATUS THIS ALL CAME COMPLETE FROM A FIRM IN STOCKHOLM FOR COOKING ON SLEDGE JOURNEYS THE PRIMUS STOVE RANKS ABOVE ALL OTHERS
2384-152900-0066 IT GIVES A GREAT DEAL OF HEAT USES LITTLE OIL AND REQUIRES NO ATTENTION ADVANTAGES WHICH ARE IMPORTANT ENOUGH ANYWHERE BUT ESPECIALLY WHEN SLEDGING THERE IS NEVER ANY TROUBLE WITH THIS APPARATUS IT HAS COME AS NEAR PERFECTION AS POSSIBLE
2384-152900-0067 WE TOOK FIVE NANSEN COOKERS WITH US THIS COOKER UTILIZES THE HEAT MORE COMPLETELY THAN ANY OTHER BUT I HAVE ONE OBJECTION TO MAKE TO IT IT TAKES UP SPACE WE USED IT ON OUR DEPOT JOURNEYS
2384-152900-0068 BUT WERE UNFORTUNATELY OBLIGED TO GIVE IT UP ON THE MAIN SOUTHERN JOURNEY WE WERE SO MANY IN A TENT AND SPACE WAS SO LIMITED THAT I DARED NOT RISK USING IT IF ONE HAS ROOM ENOUGH IT IS IDEAL IN MY OPINION
2384-152900-0069 WE HAD WITH US TEN PAIRS OF SNOW SHOES AND ONE HUNDRED SETS OF DOG HARNESS OF THE ALASKA ESKIMO PATTERN THE ALASKA ESKIMO DRIVE THEIR DOGS IN TANDEM THE WHOLE PULL IS THUS STRAIGHT AHEAD IN THE DIRECTION THE SLEDGE IS GOING
2384-152900-0070 AND THIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE BEST WAY OF UTILIZING THE POWER I HAD MADE UP MY MIND TO ADOPT THE SAME SYSTEM IN SLEDGING ON THE BARRIER ANOTHER GREAT ADVANTAGE IT HAD WAS THAT THE DOGS WOULD PASS SINGLY ACROSS FISSURES
2384-152900-0071 SO THAT THE DANGER OF FALLING THROUGH WAS CONSIDERABLY REDUCED THE EXERTION OF PULLING IS ALSO LESS TRYING WITH ALASKA HARNESS THAN WITH THE GREENLAND KIND AS THE ALASKA HARNESS HAS A SHALLOW PADDED COLLAR
2384-152900-0072 WHICH IS SLIPPED OVER THE ANIMAL'S HEAD AND MAKES THE WEIGHT OF THE PULL COME ON HIS SHOULDERS WHEREAS THE GREENLAND HARNESS PRESSES ON HIS CHEST RAW PLACES WHICH OCCUR RATHER FREQUENTLY WITH THE GREENLAND HARNESS ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY AVOIDED WITH THE OTHER
2384-152900-0073 ALL THE SETS OF HARNESS WERE MADE IN THE NAVY WORKSHOPS AND AFTER THEIR LONG AND HARD USE THEY ARE AS GOOD AS EVER THERE COULD BE NO BETTER RECOMMENDATION THAN THIS OF INSTRUMENTS AND APPARATUS FOR THE SLEDGE JOURNEYS WE CARRIED TWO SEXTANTS
2384-152900-0074 THREE ARTIFICIAL HORIZONS OF WHICH TWO WERE GLASS HORIZONS WITH DARK GLASSES AND ONE A MERCURY HORIZON AND FOUR SPIRIT COMPASSES MADE IN CHRISTIANIA THEY WERE EXCELLENT LITTLE COMPASSES
2384-152900-0075 I HAD DRAWN THE MAKER'S ATTENTION TO THIS BEFOREHAND AND ASKED HIM TO USE AS PURE A SPIRIT AS POSSIBLE WHAT HIS OBJECT WAS I STILL DO NOT KNOW BUT THE SPIRIT HE EMPLOYED WAS HIGHLY DILUTE
2384-152900-0076 THE BEST PROOF OF THIS WAS THAT THE LIQUID IN OUR COMPASSES FROZE BEFORE THE SPIRITS IN A FLASK WE WERE NATURALLY INCONVENIENCED BY THIS BESIDES THESE WE HAD AN ORDINARY LITTLE POCKET COMPASS TWO PAIRS OF BINOCULARS ONE BY ZEISS AND THE OTHER BY GOERTZ
2384-152900-0077 AND SNOW GOGGLES FROM DOCTOR SCHANZ
2384-152900-0078 DURING THE WHOLE STAY ON THE BARRIER I MYSELF WORE A PAIR OF ORDINARY SPECTACLES WITH YELLOW GLASSES OF QUITE A LIGHT TINT
2384-152900-0079 HOW EXCELLENT THESE GLASSES ARE APPEARS CLEARLY ENOUGH FROM THE FACT THAT I NEVER HAD THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH OF SNOW BLINDNESS ON THE SOUTHERN JOURNEY
2384-152900-0080 IT WILL PERHAPS BE SUGGESTED THAT I AM LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO THIS AILMENT THAN OTHERS BUT I KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT SUCH IS NOT THE CASE I HAVE PREVIOUSLY HAD SEVERAL SEVERE ATTACKS OF SNOW BLINDNESS WE HAD TWO PHOTOGRAPHIC CAMERAS AN AIR THERMOMETER
2384-152900-0081 TWO ANEROIDS WITH ALTITUDE SCALE TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND FEET AND TWO HYPSOMETERS THE HYPSOMETER IS ONLY AN INSTRUMENT FOR DETERMINING THE BOILING POINT WHICH GIVES ONE THE HEIGHT ABOVE THE SEA THE METHOD IS BOTH SIMPLE AND RELIABLE
2384-152900-0082 THE MEDICAL STORES FOR SLEDGING WERE GIVEN BY A LONDON FIRM AND THE WAY IN WHICH THE THINGS WERE PACKED SPEAKS FOR THE WHOLE OUTFIT THERE IS NOT A SPECK OF RUST ON NEEDLES SCISSORS KNIVES OR ANYTHING ELSE ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO MUCH DAMP
2384-152900-0083 OUR OWN MEDICAL OUTFIT WHICH WAS BOUGHT IN CHRISTIANIA AND ACCORDING TO THE VENDOR'S STATEMENT UNUSUALLY WELL PACKED BECAME IN A SHORT TIME SO DAMAGED THAT THE WHOLE OF IT IS NOW ENTIRELY SPOILT THE SLEDGING PROVISIONS MUST BE MENTIONED BRIEFLY
2384-152900-0084 I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN OF THE PEMMICAN I HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO TAKE A WHOLE GROCER'S SHOP WITH ME WHEN SLEDGING THE FOOD SHOULD BE SIMPLE AND NOURISHING AND THAT IS ENOUGH A RICH AND VARIED MENU IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO WORK TO DO
2384-152900-0085 BESIDES THE PEMMICAN WE HAD BISCUITS MILK POWDER AND CHOCOLATE THE BISCUITS WERE A PRESENT FROM A WELL KNOWN NORWEGIAN FACTORY AND DID ALL HONOUR TO THEIR ORIGIN THEY WERE SPECIALLY BAKED FOR US AND WERE MADE OF OATMEAL WITH THE ADDITION OF DRIED MILK AND A LITTLE SUGAR
2384-152900-0086 THEY WERE EXTREMELY NOURISHING AND PLEASANT TO THE TASTE THANKS TO EFFICIENT PACKING THEY KEPT FRESH AND CRISP ALL THE TIME THESE BISCUITS FORMED A GREAT PART OF OUR DAILY DIET AND UNDOUBTEDLY CONTRIBUTED IN NO SMALL DEGREE TO THE SUCCESSFUL RESULT
2384-152900-0087 MILK POWDER IS A COMPARATIVELY NEW COMMODITY WITH US BUT IT DESERVES TO BE BETTER KNOWN IT CAME FROM THE DISTRICT OF JAEDEREN NEITHER HEAT NOR COLD DRYNESS NOR WET COULD HURT IT
2384-152900-0088 WE HAD LARGE QUANTITIES OF IT LYING OUT IN SMALL THIN LINEN BAGS IN EVERY POSSIBLE STATE OF THE WEATHER THE POWDER WAS AS GOOD THE LAST DAY AS THE FIRST WE ALSO TOOK DRIED MILK FROM A FIRM IN WISCONSIN THIS MILK HAD AN ADDITION OF MALT AND SUGAR
2384-152900-0089 AND WAS IN MY OPINION EXCELLENT IT ALSO KEPT GOOD THE WHOLE TIME THE CHOCOLATE CAME FROM A WORLD RENOWNED FIRM AND WAS BEYOND ALL PRAISE THE WHOLE SUPPLY WAS A VERY ACCEPTABLE GIFT
2391-145015-0000 STEVENTON IS A SMALL RURAL VILLAGE UPON THE CHALK HILLS OF NORTH HANTS SITUATED IN A WINDING VALLEY ABOUT SEVEN MILES FROM BASINGSTOKE THE SOUTH WESTERN RAILWAY CROSSES IT BY A SHORT EMBANKMENT
2391-145015-0001 AND AS IT CURVES ROUND PRESENTS A GOOD VIEW OF IT ON THE LEFT HAND TO THOSE WHO ARE TRAVELLING DOWN THE LINE ABOUT THREE MILES BEFORE ENTERING THE TUNNEL UNDER POPHAM BEACON IT MAY BE KNOWN TO SOME SPORTSMEN AS LYING IN ONE OF THE BEST PORTIONS OF THE VINE HUNT
2391-145015-0002 IT IS CERTAINLY NOT A PICTURESQUE COUNTRY IT PRESENTS NO GRAND OR EXTENSIVE VIEWS BUT THE FEATURES ARE SMALL RATHER THAN PLAIN THE SURFACE CONTINUALLY SWELLS AND SINKS BUT THE HILLS ARE NOT BOLD NOR THE VALLEYS DEEP
2391-145015-0003 AND THOUGH IT IS SUFFICIENTLY WELL CLOTHED WITH WOODS AND HEDGEROWS YET THE POVERTY OF THE SOIL IN MOST PLACES PREVENTS THE TIMBER FROM ATTAINING A LARGE SIZE STILL IT HAS ITS BEAUTIES THE LANES WIND ALONG IN A NATURAL CURVE
2391-145015-0004 CONTINUALLY FRINGED WITH IRREGULAR BORDERS OF NATIVE TURF AND LEAD TO PLEASANT NOOKS AND CORNERS ONE WHO KNEW AND LOVED IT WELL VERY HAPPILY EXPRESSED ITS QUIET CHARMS WHEN HE WROTE TRUE TASTE IS NOT FASTIDIOUS
2391-145015-0005 NOR REJECTS BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT COME WITHIN THE RULE OF COMPOSITION PURE AND PICTURESQUE UNNUMBERED SIMPLE SCENES WHICH FILL THE LEAVES OF NATURE'S SKETCH BOOK OF THIS SOMEWHAT TAME COUNTRY STEVENTON FROM THE FALL OF THE GROUND AND THE ABUNDANCE OF ITS TIMBER
2391-145015-0006 IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE PRETTIEST SPOTS
2391-145015-0007 COMPARED WITH THE BROAD RIVER THE RICH VALLEY AND THE NOBLE HILLS WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO BEHOLD AT HER NATIVE HOME NEAR HENLEY UPON THAMES THE HOUSE ITSELF STOOD IN A SHALLOW VALLEY SURROUNDED BY SLOPING MEADOWS WELL SPRINKLED WITH ELM TREES AT THE END OF A SMALL VILLAGE OF COTTAGES
2391-145015-0008 EACH WELL PROVIDED WITH A GARDEN SCATTERED ABOUT PRETTILY ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY COMMODIOUS TO HOLD PUPILS IN ADDITION TO A GROWING FAMILY AND WAS IN THOSE TIMES CONSIDERED TO BE ABOVE THE AVERAGE OF PARSONAGES
2391-145015-0009 NO CORNICE MARKED THE JUNCTION OF WALL AND CEILING WHILE THE BEAMS WHICH SUPPORTED THE UPPER FLOORS PROJECTED INTO THE ROOMS BELOW IN ALL THEIR NAKED SIMPLICITY COVERED ONLY BY A COAT OF PAINT OR WHITEWASH
2391-145015-0010 AND ABOUT FORTY FIVE YEARS AGO IT WAS PULLED DOWN FOR THE PURPOSE OF ERECTING A NEW HOUSE IN A FAR BETTER SITUATION ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE VALLEY
2391-145015-0011 ON THE SOUTH SIDE THE GROUND ROSE GENTLY AND WAS OCCUPIED BY ONE OF THOSE OLD FASHIONED GARDENS IN WHICH VEGETABLES AND FLOWERS ARE COMBINED FLANKED AND PROTECTED ON THE EAST BY ONE OF THE THATCHED MUD WALLS COMMON IN THAT COUNTRY AND OVERSHADOWED BY FINE ELMS
2391-145015-0012 ALONG THE UPPER OR SOUTHERN SIDE OF THIS GARDEN RAN A TERRACE OF THE FINEST TURF
2391-145015-0013 BUT THE CHIEF BEAUTY OF STEVENTON CONSISTED IN ITS HEDGEROWS A HEDGEROW IN THAT COUNTRY DOES NOT MEAN A THIN FORMAL LINE OF QUICKSET BUT AN IRREGULAR BORDER OF COPSE WOOD AND TIMBER OFTEN WIDE ENOUGH TO CONTAIN WITHIN IT A WINDING FOOTPATH OR A ROUGH CART TRACK
2391-145015-0014 AND NOW AND THEN THE UNWELCOME ADDER TWO SUCH HEDGEROWS RADIATED AS IT WERE FROM THE PARSONAGE GARDEN ONE A CONTINUATION OF THE TURF TERRACE PROCEEDED WESTWARD FORMING THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE HOME MEADOWS
2391-145015-0015 AND WAS FORMED INTO A RUSTIC SHRUBBERY WITH OCCASIONAL SEATS ENTITLED THE WOOD WALK THE OTHER RAN STRAIGHT UP THE HILL UNDER THE NAME OF THE CHURCH WALK BECAUSE IT LED TO THE PARISH CHURCH
2391-145015-0016 WHO HAVE FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY RENTED IT TOGETHER WITH THE CHIEF FARM IN THE PARISH THE CHURCH ITSELF I SPEAK OF IT AS IT THEN WAS BEFORE THE IMPROVEMENTS MADE BY THE PRESENT RECTOR
2391-145015-0017 MIGHT HAVE APPEARED MEAN AND UNINTERESTING TO AN ORDINARY OBSERVER BUT THE ADEPT IN CHURCH ARCHITECTURE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT IT MUST HAVE STOOD THERE SOME SEVEN CENTURIES AND WOULD HAVE FOUND BEAUTY IN THE VERY NARROW EARLY ENGLISH WINDOWS
2391-145015-0018 WHILE ITS SOLITARY POSITION FAR FROM THE HUM OF THE VILLAGE AND WITHIN SIGHT OF NO HABITATION EXCEPT A GLIMPSE OF THE GRAY MANOR HOUSE THROUGH ITS CIRCLING SCREEN OF SYCAMORES HAS IN IT SOMETHING SOLEMN AND APPROPRIATE TO THE LAST RESTING PLACE OF THE SILENT DEAD
2391-145015-0019 SWEET VIOLETS BOTH PURPLE AND WHITE GROW IN ABUNDANCE BENEATH ITS SOUTH WALL ONE MAY IMAGINE FOR HOW MANY CENTURIES THE ANCESTORS OF THOSE LITTLE FLOWERS HAVE OCCUPIED THAT UNDISTURBED SUNNY NOOK
2391-145015-0020 THICK COMING FANCIES ROSE IN HER MIND AND GRADUALLY ASSUMED THE FORMS IN WHICH THEY CAME FORTH TO THE WORLD
2391-145015-0021 THE FAMILY WAS UNBROKEN BY DEATH AND SELDOM VISITED BY SORROW THEIR SITUATION HAD SOME PECULIAR ADVANTAGES BEYOND THOSE OF ORDINARY RECTORIES STEVENTON WAS A FAMILY LIVING MISTER KNIGHT THE PATRON WAS ALSO PROPRIETOR OF NEARLY THE WHOLE PARISH
2391-145015-0022 THEY SHARED WITH THE PRINCIPAL TENANT THE COMMAND OF AN EXCELLENT MANOR AND ENJOYED IN THIS REFLECTED WAY SOME OF THE CONSIDERATION USUALLY AWARDED TO LANDED PROPRIETORS
2391-145015-0023 THEY HAD ENOUGH TO AFFORD A GOOD EDUCATION TO THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS TO MIX IN THE BEST SOCIETY OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND TO EXERCISE A LIBERAL HOSPITALITY TO THEIR OWN RELATIONS AND FRIENDS A CARRIAGE AND A PAIR OF HORSES WERE KEPT
2391-145015-0024 THIS MIGHT IMPLY A HIGHER STYLE OF LIVING IN OUR DAYS THAN IT DID IN THEIRS THERE WERE THEN NO ASSESSED TAXES THE CARRIAGE ONCE BOUGHT ENTAILED LITTLE FURTHER EXPENSE AND THE HORSES PROBABLY LIKE MISTER BENNET'S WERE OFTEN EMPLOYED ON FARM WORK
2391-145015-0025 MOREOVER IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT A PAIR OF HORSES IN THOSE DAYS WERE ALMOST NECESSARY IF LADIES WERE TO MOVE ABOUT AT ALL
2391-145015-0026 WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THE FEW SPECIMENS STILL REMAINING OF COACH BUILDING IN THE LAST CENTURY IT STRIKES ONE THAT THE CHIEF OBJECT OF THE BUILDERS MUST HAVE BEEN TO COMBINE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE WEIGHT WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF ACCOMMODATION
2391-145015-0027 THE FAMILY LIVED IN CLOSE INTIMACY WITH TWO COUSINS EDWARD AND JANE COOPER THE CHILDREN OF MISSUS AUSTEN'S ELDEST SISTER AND DOCTOR COOPER THE VICAR OF SONNING NEAR READING THE COOPERS LIVED FOR SOME YEARS AT BATH
2391-145015-0028 I BELIEVE THAT CASSANDRA AND JANE SOMETIMES VISITED THEM THERE AND THAT JANE THUS ACQUIRED THE INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TOPOGRAPHY AND CUSTOMS OF BATH WHICH ENABLED HER TO WRITE NORTHANGER ABBEY LONG BEFORE SHE RESIDED THERE HERSELF
2391-145015-0029 AFTER THE DEATH OF THEIR OWN PARENTS THE TWO YOUNG COOPERS PAID LONG VISITS AT STEVENTON EDWARD COOPER DID NOT LIVE UNDISTINGUISHED
2391-145015-0030 AND IN LATER LIFE HE WAS KNOWN BY A WORK ON PROPHECY CALLED THE CRISIS AND OTHER RELIGIOUS PUBLICATIONS ESPECIALLY FOR SEVERAL VOLUMES OF SERMONS MUCH PREACHED IN MANY PULPITS IN MY YOUTH
2391-145015-0031 JANE COOPER WAS MARRIED FROM HER UNCLE'S HOUSE AT STEVENTON TO CAPTAIN AFTERWARDS SIR THOMAS WILLIAMS UNDER WHOM CHARLES AUSTEN SERVED IN SEVERAL SHIPS SHE WAS A DEAR FRIEND OF HER NAMESAKE
2391-145015-0032 BUT WAS FATED TO BECOME A CAUSE OF GREAT SORROW TO HER FOR A FEW YEARS AFTER THE MARRIAGE SHE WAS SUDDENLY KILLED BY AN ACCIDENT TO HER CARRIAGE THERE WAS ANOTHER COUSIN CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AT STEVENTON
2391-145015-0033 WHO MUST HAVE INTRODUCED GREATER VARIETY INTO THE FAMILY CIRCLE THIS WAS THE DAUGHTER OF MISTER AUSTEN'S ONLY SISTER MISSUS HANCOCK
2391-145015-0034 OF WHOM I KNOW LITTLE MORE THAN THAT HE PERISHED BY THE GUILLOTINE DURING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION PERHAPS HIS CHIEF OFFENCE WAS HIS RANK BUT IT WAS SAID THAT THE CHARGE OF INCIVISM UNDER WHICH HE SUFFERED RESTED ON THE FACT OF HIS HAVING LAID DOWN SOME ARABLE LAND INTO PASTURE
2391-145015-0035 HIS WIFE ESCAPED THROUGH DANGERS AND DIFFICULTIES TO ENGLAND WAS RECEIVED FOR SOME TIME INTO HER UNCLE'S FAMILY AND FINALLY MARRIED HER COUSIN HENRY AUSTEN
2391-145015-0036 SHE AND HER SECOND HUSBAND WENT TO FRANCE IN THE HOPE OF RECOVERING SOME OF THE COUNT'S PROPERTY AND THERE NARROWLY ESCAPED BEING INCLUDED AMONGST THE DETENUS ORDERS HAD BEEN GIVEN BY BUONAPARTE'S GOVERNMENT TO DETAIN ALL ENGLISH TRAVELLERS
2391-145015-0037 BUT AT THE POST HOUSES MISSUS HENRY AUSTEN GAVE THE NECESSARY ORDERS HERSELF AND HER FRENCH WAS SO PERFECT THAT SHE PASSED EVERYWHERE FOR A NATIVE
2391-145015-0038 SHE WAS A CLEVER WOMAN AND HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED AFTER THE FRENCH RATHER THAN THE ENGLISH MODE AND IN THOSE DAYS WHEN INTERCOURSE WITH THE CONTINENT WAS LONG INTERRUPTED BY WAR SUCH AN ELEMENT IN THE SOCIETY OF A COUNTRY PARSONAGE MUST HAVE BEEN A RARE ACQUISITION
2391-145015-0039 THE SISTERS MAY HAVE BEEN MORE INDEBTED TO THIS COUSIN THAN TO MISSUS LA TOURNELLE'S TEACHING FOR THE CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE OF FRENCH WHICH THEY POSSESSED SHE ALSO TOOK THE PRINCIPAL PARTS IN THE PRIVATE THEATRICALS IN WHICH THE FAMILY SEVERAL TIMES INDULGED
2391-145015-0040 HAVING THEIR SUMMER THEATRE IN THE BARN AND THEIR WINTER ONE WITHIN THE NARROW LIMITS OF THE DINING ROOM WHERE THE NUMBER OF THE AUDIENCE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY LIMITED ON THESE OCCASIONS THE PROLOGUES AND EPILOGUES WERE WRITTEN BY JANE'S ELDEST BROTHER
2391-145015-0041 AND SOME OF THEM ARE VERY VIGOROUS AND AMUSING JANE WAS ONLY TWELVE YEARS OLD AT THE TIME OF THE EARLIEST OF THESE REPRESENTATIONS AND NOT MORE THAN FIFTEEN WHEN THE LAST TOOK PLACE SHE WAS HOWEVER AN EARLY OBSERVER
2391-145015-0042 AND IT MAY BE REASONABLY SUPPOSED THAT SOME OF THE INCIDENTS AND FEELINGS WHICH ARE SO VIVIDLY PAINTED IN THE MANSFIELD PARK THEATRICALS ARE DUE TO HER RECOLLECTIONS OF THESE ENTERTAINMENTS SOME TIME BEFORE THEY LEFT STEVENTON ONE GREAT AFFLICTION CAME UPON THE FAMILY
2391-145015-0043 HE ACCOMPANIED THIS FRIEND TO THE WEST INDIES AS CHAPLAIN TO HIS REGIMENT AND THERE DIED OF YELLOW FEVER TO THE GREAT CONCERN OF HIS FRIEND AND PATRON WHO AFTERWARDS DECLARED THAT IF HE HAD KNOWN OF THE ENGAGEMENT HE WOULD NOT HAVE PERMITTED HIM TO GO OUT TO SUCH A CLIMATE
2391-145015-0044 THIS LITTLE DOMESTIC TRAGEDY CAUSED GREAT AND LASTING GRIEF TO THE PRINCIPAL SUFFERER AND COULD NOT BUT CAST A GLOOM OVER THE WHOLE PARTY THE SYMPATHY OF JANE WAS PROBABLY FROM HER AGE AND HER PECULIAR ATTACHMENT TO HER SISTER
2391-145015-0045 HER REVIEWER IN THE QUARTERLY OF JANUARY EIGHTEEN TWENTY ONE OBSERVES CONCERNING THE ATTACHMENT OF FANNY PRICE TO EDMUND BERTRAM THE SILENCE IN WHICH THIS PASSION IS CHERISHED THE SLENDER HOPES AND ENJOYMENTS BY WHICH IT IS FED
2391-145015-0046 THE RESTLESSNESS AND JEALOUSY WITH WHICH IT FILLS A MIND NATURALLY ACTIVE CONTENTED AND UNSUSPICIOUS THE MANNER IN WHICH IT TINGES EVERY EVENT AND EVERY REFLECTION ARE PAINTED WITH A VIVIDNESS AND A DETAIL OF WHICH WE CAN SCARCELY CONCEIVE ANY ONE BUT A FEMALE
2391-145015-0047 AND WE SHOULD ALMOST ADD A FEMALE WRITING FROM RECOLLECTION CAPABLE THIS CONJECTURE HOWEVER PROBABLE WAS WIDE OF THE MARK THE PICTURE WAS DRAWN FROM THE INTUITIVE PERCEPTIONS OF GENIUS NOT FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
2391-145015-0048 IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE OF HER LIFE WAS THERE ANY SIMILARITY BETWEEN HERSELF AND HER HEROINE IN MANSFIELD PARK
2391-145015-0049 IN HER YOUTH SHE HAD DECLINED THE ADDRESSES OF A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF GOOD CHARACTER AND CONNECTIONS AND POSITION IN LIFE OF EVERYTHING IN FACT EXCEPT THE SUBTLE POWER OF TOUCHING HER HEART
2391-145015-0050 THERE IS HOWEVER ONE PASSAGE OF ROMANCE IN HER HISTORY WITH WHICH I AM IMPERFECTLY ACQUAINTED AND TO WHICH I AM UNABLE TO ASSIGN NAME OR DATE OR PLACE THOUGH I HAVE IT ON SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY
2391-145015-0051 MANY YEARS AFTER HER DEATH SOME CIRCUMSTANCES INDUCED HER SISTER CASSANDRA TO BREAK THROUGH HER HABITUAL RETICENCE AND TO SPEAK OF IT
2391-145015-0052 WHOSE CHARM OF PERSON MIND AND MANNERS WAS SUCH THAT CASSANDRA THOUGHT HIM WORTHY TO POSSESS AND LIKELY TO WIN HER SISTER'S LOVE WHEN THEY PARTED
2391-145015-0053 AND CASSANDRA FELT NO DOUBT AS TO HIS MOTIVES BUT THEY NEVER AGAIN MET WITHIN A SHORT TIME THEY HEARD OF HIS SUDDEN DEATH I BELIEVE THAT IF JANE EVER LOVED IT WAS THIS UNNAMED GENTLEMAN BUT THE ACQUAINTANCE HAD BEEN SHORT
2391-145015-0054 ANY DESCRIPTION THAT I MIGHT ATTEMPT OF THE FAMILY LIFE AT STEVENTON WHICH CLOSED SOON AFTER I WAS BORN COULD BE LITTLE BETTER THAN A FANCY PIECE
2391-145015-0055 WOULD SEEM STRANGE TO US AND SHOULD MISS MANY MORE TO WHICH WE ARE ACCUSTOMED EVERY HUNDRED YEARS AND ESPECIALLY A CENTURY LIKE THE LAST MARKED BY AN EXTRAORDINARY ADVANCE IN WEALTH LUXURY AND REFINEMENT OF TASTE AS WELL AS IN THE MECHANICAL ARTS WHICH EMBELLISH OUR HOUSES
2391-145015-0056 MUST PRODUCE A GREAT CHANGE IN THEIR ASPECT THESE CHANGES ARE ALWAYS AT WORK THEY ARE GOING ON NOW BUT SO SILENTLY THAT WE TAKE NO NOTE OF THEM MEN SOON FORGET THE SMALL OBJECTS WHICH THEY LEAVE BEHIND THEM AS THEY DRIFT DOWN THE STREAM OF LIFE
2391-145015-0057 AS POPE SAYS NOR DOES LIFE'S STREAM FOR OBSERVATION STAY IT HURRIES ALL TOO FAST TO MARK THEIR WAY IMPORTANT INVENTIONS SUCH AS THE APPLICATIONS OF STEAM GAS AND ELECTRICITY MAY FIND THEIR PLACES IN HISTORY
2391-145015-0058 WHO CAN NOW RECORD THE DEGREES BY WHICH THE CUSTOM PREVALENT IN MY YOUTH OF ASKING EACH OTHER TO TAKE WINE TOGETHER AT DINNER BECAME OBSOLETE WHO WILL BE ABLE TO FIX TWENTY YEARS HENCE THE DATE WHEN OUR DINNERS BEGAN TO BE CARVED AND HANDED ROUND BY SERVANTS
2391-145015-0059 INSTEAD OF SMOKING BEFORE OUR EYES AND NOSES ON THE TABLE TO RECORD SUCH LITTLE MATTERS WOULD INDEED BE TO CHRONICLE SMALL BEER
2391-145015-0060 BUT WHICH THE HISTORIAN HAS THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN RECOVERING AT THAT TIME THE DINNER TABLE PRESENTED A FAR LESS SPLENDID APPEARANCE THAN IT DOES NOW IT WAS APPROPRIATED TO SOLID FOOD RATHER THAN TO FLOWERS FRUITS AND DECORATIONS
2391-145015-0061 NOR WAS THERE MUCH GLITTER OF PLATE UPON IT FOR THE EARLY DINNER HOUR RENDERED CANDLESTICKS UNNECESSARY
2391-145015-0062 THOUGH NOT LESS PLENTIFUL AND SAVOURY AND THE BILL OF FARE IN ONE HOUSE WOULD NOT BE SO LIKE THAT IN ANOTHER AS IT IS NOW FOR FAMILY RECEIPTS WERE HELD IN HIGH ESTIMATION
2391-145015-0063 AND MIGHT INFLUENCE THE FAMILY DINNER FOR MANY GENERATIONS
2391-145015-0064 ONE HOUSE WOULD PRIDE ITSELF ON ITS HAM ANOTHER ON ITS GAME PIE AND A THIRD ON ITS SUPERIOR FURMITY OR TANSEY PUDDING BEER AND HOME MADE WINES ESPECIALLY MEAD WERE MORE LARGELY CONSUMED VEGETABLES WERE LESS PLENTIFUL AND LESS VARIOUS
2391-145015-0065 POTATOES WERE USED BUT NOT SO ABUNDANTLY AS NOW AND THERE WAS AN IDEA THAT THEY WERE TO BE EATEN ONLY WITH ROAST MEAT THEY WERE NOVELTIES TO A TENANT'S WIFE WHO WAS ENTERTAINED AT STEVENTON PARSONAGE CERTAINLY LESS THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO
2391-145015-0066 AND WHEN MISSUS AUSTEN ADVISED HER TO PLANT THEM IN HER OWN GARDEN SHE REPLIED NO NO THEY ARE VERY WELL FOR YOU GENTRY BUT THEY MUST BE TERRIBLY COSTLY TO REAR BUT A STILL GREATER DIFFERENCE WOULD BE FOUND IN THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOMS
2391-145015-0067 WHICH WOULD APPEAR TO US LAMENTABLY SCANTY THERE WAS A GENERAL DEFICIENCY OF CARPETING IN SITTING ROOMS BED ROOMS AND PASSAGES A PIANOFORTE OR RATHER A SPINNET OR HARPSICHORD WAS BY NO MEANS A NECESSARY APPENDAGE
2391-145015-0068 IT WAS TO BE FOUND ONLY WHERE THERE WAS A DECIDED TASTE FOR MUSIC NOT SO COMMON THEN AS NOW OR IN SUCH GREAT HOUSES AS WOULD PROBABLY CONTAIN A BILLIARD TABLE THERE WOULD OFTEN BE BUT ONE SOFA IN THE HOUSE AND THAT A STIFF ANGULAR
2391-145015-0069 UNCOMFORTABLE ARTICLE THERE WERE NO DEEP EASY CHAIRS NOR OTHER APPLIANCES FOR LOUNGING FOR TO LIE DOWN OR EVEN TO LEAN BACK WAS A LUXURY PERMITTED ONLY TO OLD PERSONS OR INVALIDS
2391-145015-0070 AND A MODEL GENTLEMAN OF HIS DAY THAT HE WOULD HAVE MADE THE TOUR OF EUROPE WITHOUT EVER TOUCHING THE BACK OF HIS TRAVELLING CARRIAGE BUT PERHAPS WE SHOULD BE MOST STRUCK WITH THE TOTAL ABSENCE OF THOSE ELEGANT LITTLE ARTICLES WHICH NOW EMBELLISH AND ENCUMBER OUR DRAWING ROOM TABLES
2391-145015-0071 WE SHOULD MISS THE SLIDING BOOKCASES AND PICTURE STANDS
2391-145015-0072 THE PERIODICALS AND ILLUSTRATED NEWSPAPERS ABOVE ALL
2391-145015-0073 A SMALL WRITING DESK WITH A SMALLER WORK BOX OR NETTING CASE WAS ALL THAT EACH YOUNG LADY CONTRIBUTED TO OCCUPY THE TABLE FOR THE LARGE FAMILY WORK BASKET THOUGH OFTEN PRODUCED IN THE PARLOUR LIVED IN THE CLOSET
2391-145015-0074 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MORE DANCING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN THOSE DAYS THAN THERE IS NOW
2391-145015-0075 AS IF IT WERE A NATURAL PRODUCTION WITH LESS FASTIDIOUSNESS AS TO THE QUALITY OF MUSIC LIGHTS AND FLOOR MANY COUNTRY TOWNS HAD A MONTHLY BALL THROUGHOUT THE WINTER IN SOME OF WHICH THE SAME APARTMENT SERVED FOR DANCING AND TEA ROOM
2391-145015-0076 TO THE MUSIC OF A HARPSICHORD IN THE HOUSE OR A FIDDLE FROM THE VILLAGE THIS WAS ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE
2391-145015-0077 FOR SHE ATTRIBUTES THIS TASTE TO HER FAVOURITE HEROINES
2391-145015-0078 AND MADE OF IMPORTANCE MANY THINGS CONNECTED WITH THE BALL ROOMS OF THOSE DAYS HAVE NOW PASSED INTO OBLIVION THE BARBAROUS LAW WHICH CONFINED THE LADY TO ONE PARTNER THROUGHOUT THE EVENING MUST INDEED HAVE BEEN ABOLISHED BEFORE JANE WENT TO BALLS
2391-145015-0079 IT MUST BE OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT THIS CUSTOM WAS IN ONE RESPECT ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE GENTLEMAN INASMUCH AS IT RENDERED HIS DUTIES MORE PRACTICABLE HE WAS BOUND TO CALL UPON HIS PARTNER THE NEXT MORNING
2391-145015-0080 TO GALLOP ALL THE COUNTRY OVER THE LAST NIGHT'S PARTNER TO BEHOLD AND HUMBLY HOPE SHE CAUGHT NO COLD BUT THE STATELY MINUET STILL REIGNED SUPREME AND EVERY REGULAR BALL COMMENCED WITH IT IT WAS A SLOW AND SOLEMN MOVEMENT
2391-145015-0081 EXPRESSIVE OF GRACE AND DIGNITY RATHER THAN OF MERRIMENT IT ABOUNDED IN FORMAL BOWS AND COURTESIES WITH MEASURED PACES FORWARDS BACKWARDS AND SIDEWAYS AND MANY COMPLICATED GYRATIONS
2391-145015-0082 IT WAS EXECUTED BY ONE LADY AND GENTLEMAN AMIDST THE ADMIRATION OR THE CRITICISM OF SURROUNDING SPECTATORS IN ITS EARLIER AND MOST PALMY DAYS AS WHEN SIR CHARLES AND LADY GRANDISON DELIGHTED THE COMPANY BY DANCING IT AT THEIR OWN WEDDING
2391-145015-0083 THE GENTLEMAN WORE A DRESS SWORD AND THE LADY WAS ARMED WITH A FAN OF NEARLY EQUAL DIMENSIONS ADDISON OBSERVES THAT WOMEN ARE ARMED WITH FANS AS MEN WITH SWORDS AND SOMETIMES DO MORE EXECUTION WITH THEM
2391-145015-0084 THE GRACEFUL CARRIAGE OF EACH WEAPON WAS CONSIDERED A TEST OF HIGH BREEDING THE CLOWNISH MAN WAS IN DANGER OF BEING TRIPPED UP BY HIS SWORD GETTING BETWEEN HIS LEGS
2391-145015-0085 AND I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THOSE LADIES WHO INTENDED TO DANCE MINUETS USED TO DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES FROM OTHERS BY WEARING A PARTICULAR KIND OF LAPPET ON THEIR HEAD DRESS I HAVE HEARD ALSO OF ANOTHER CURIOUS PROOF OF THE RESPECT IN WHICH THIS DANCE WAS HELD
2391-145015-0086 GLOVES IMMACULATELY CLEAN WERE CONSIDERED REQUISITE FOR ITS DUE PERFORMANCE WHILE GLOVES A LITTLE SOILED WERE THOUGHT GOOD ENOUGH FOR A COUNTRY DANCE AND ACCORDINGLY SOME PRUDENT LADIES PROVIDED THEMSELVES WITH TWO PAIRS FOR THEIR SEVERAL PURPOSES
2391-145015-0087 THE MINUET EXPIRED WITH THE LAST CENTURY BUT LONG AFTER IT HAD CEASED TO BE DANCED PUBLICLY IT WAS TAUGHT TO BOYS AND GIRLS IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM A GRACEFUL CARRIAGE HORNPIPES COTILLONS AND REELS WERE OCCASIONALLY DANCED
2391-145015-0088 BUT THE CHIEF OCCUPATION OF THE EVENING WAS THE INTERMINABLE COUNTRY DANCE IN WHICH ALL COULD JOIN THIS DANCE PRESENTED A GREAT SHOW OF ENJOYMENT BUT IT WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS PECULIAR TROUBLES
2391-145015-0089 THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WERE RANGED APART FROM EACH OTHER IN OPPOSITE ROWS SO THAT THE FACILITIES FOR FLIRTATION OR INTERESTING INTERCOURSE WERE NOT SO GREAT AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN DESIRED BY BOTH PARTIES MUCH HEART BURNING AND DISCONTENT SOMETIMES AROSE AS TO WHO SHOULD STAND ABOVE WHOM
2391-145015-0090 AND ESPECIALLY AS TO WHO WAS ENTITLED TO THE HIGH PRIVILEGE OF CALLING AND LEADING OFF THE FIRST DANCE AND NO LITTLE INDIGNATION WAS FELT AT THE LOWER END OF THE ROOM WHEN ANY OF THE LEADING COUPLES RETIRED PREMATURELY FROM THEIR DUTIES AND DID NOT CONDESCEND TO DANCE UP AND DOWN THE WHOLE SET
2391-145015-0091 WE MAY REJOICE THAT THESE CAUSES OF IRRITATION NO LONGER EXIST AND THAT IF SUCH FEELINGS AS JEALOUSY RIVALRY AND DISCONTENT EVER TOUCH CELESTIAL BOSOMS IN THE MODERN BALL ROOM THEY MUST ARISE FROM DIFFERENT AND MORE RECONDITE SOURCES
2391-145015-0092 I AM TEMPTED TO ADD A LITTLE ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE OF PERSONAL HABITS IT MAY BE ASSERTED AS A GENERAL TRUTH THAT LESS WAS LEFT TO THE CHARGE AND DISCRETION OF SERVANTS AND MORE WAS DONE OR SUPERINTENDED BY THE MASTERS AND MISTRESSES
2391-145015-0093 WITH REGARD TO THE MISTRESSES IT IS I BELIEVE GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT AT THE TIME TO WHICH I REFER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THEY TOOK A PERSONAL PART IN THE HIGHER BRANCHES OF COOKERY AS WELL AS IN THE CONCOCTION OF HOME MADE WINES
2391-145015-0094 AND DISTILLING OF HERBS FOR DOMESTIC MEDICINES WHICH ARE NEARLY ALLIED TO THE SAME ART LADIES DID NOT DISDAIN TO SPIN THE THREAD OF WHICH THE HOUSEHOLD LINEN WAS WOVEN SOME LADIES LIKED TO WASH WITH THEIR OWN HANDS THEIR CHOICE CHINA AFTER BREAKFAST OR TEA
2391-145015-0095 AS THAT THEY TOOK AN INTEREST IN SUCH OCCUPATIONS AND IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND HOW MANY SOURCES OF INTEREST ENJOYED BY THIS GENERATION WERE THEN CLOSED OR VERY SCANTILY OPENED TO LADIES A VERY SMALL MINORITY OF THEM CARED MUCH FOR LITERATURE OR SCIENCE
2391-145015-0096 BUT I DOUBT WHETHER THE RISING GENERATION ARE EQUALLY AWARE HOW MUCH GENTLEMEN ALSO DID FOR THEMSELVES IN THOSE TIMES
2391-145015-0097 THAN THEY ARE NOW MASTER'S EYE MAKES THE HORSE FAT AND IF YOU WOULD BE WELL SERVED SERVE YOURSELF SOME GENTLEMEN TOOK PLEASURE IN BEING THEIR OWN GARDENERS PERFORMING ALL THE SCIENTIFIC AND SOME OF THE MANUAL WORK THEMSELVES
2391-145015-0098 WELL DRESSED YOUNG MEN OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD THEIR COAT FROM A LONDON TAILOR WOULD ALWAYS BRUSH THEIR EVENING SUIT THEMSELVES RATHER THAN ENTRUST IT TO THE CARELESSNESS OF A ROUGH SERVANT AND TO THE RISKS OF DIRT AND GREASE IN THE KITCHEN
2391-145015-0099 FOR IN THOSE DAYS SERVANTS HALLS WERE NOT COMMON IN THE HOUSES OF THE CLERGY AND THE SMALLER COUNTRY GENTRY IT WAS QUITE NATURAL THAT CATHERINE MORLAND SHOULD HAVE CONTRASTED THE MAGNIFICENCE OF THE OFFICES AT NORTHANGER ABBEY WITH THE FEW SHAPELESS PANTRIES IN HER FATHER'S PARSONAGE
2391-145015-0100 A YOUNG MAN WHO EXPECTED TO HAVE HIS THINGS PACKED OR UNPACKED FOR HIM BY A SERVANT WHEN HE TRAVELLED
2391-145015-0101 IT WAS THOUGHT MERITORIOUS ON THE EVENING OF A HUNTING DAY TO TURN OUT AFTER DINNER LANTHORN IN HAND AND VISIT THE STABLE TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE HORSE HAD BEEN WELL CARED FOR THIS WAS OF THE MORE IMPORTANCE BECAUSE PREVIOUS TO THE INTRODUCTION OF CLIPPING ABOUT THE YEAR EIGHTEEN TWENTY
2391-145015-0102 IT WAS A DIFFICULT AND TEDIOUS WORK TO MAKE A LONG COATED HUNTER DRY AND COMFORTABLE AND WAS OFTEN VERY IMPERFECTLY DONE OF COURSE SUCH THINGS WERE NOT PRACTISED BY THOSE WHO HAD GAMEKEEPERS AND STUD GROOMS AND PLENTY OF WELL TRAINED SERVANTS
2391-145015-0103 BUT THEY WERE PRACTISED BY MANY WHO WERE UNEQUIVOCALLY GENTLEMEN AND WHOSE GRANDSONS OCCUPYING THE SAME POSITION IN LIFE MAY PERHAPS BE ASTONISHED AT BEING TOLD THAT SUCH THINGS WERE
2391-145015-0104 OF COURSE THEY CANNOT BE UNIVERSALLY APPLICABLE SUCH DETAILS VARIED IN VARIOUS CIRCLES AND WERE CHANGED VERY GRADUALLY
2391-145015-0105 BUT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THEIR WAY OF LIFE DIFFERED A LITTLE FROM OURS
2391-145015-0106 IT MAY BE THAT USEFUL ARTICLES WHICH WOULD NOT NOW BE PRODUCED IN DRAWING ROOMS WERE HEMMED AND MARKED AND DARNED IN THE OLD FASHIONED PARLOUR BUT ALL THIS CONCERNED ONLY THE OUTER LIFE THERE WAS AS MUCH CULTIVATION AND REFINEMENT OF MIND AS NOW
2391-145015-0107 THE EARLY HOUR AT WHICH HOUNDS THEN MET MAY ACCOUNT FOR THIS
2391-145015-0108 FOR THEY HUNTED AT AN EARLY AGE IN A SCRAMBLING SORT OF WAY UPON ANY PONY OR DONKEY THAT THEY COULD PROCURE OR IN DEFAULT OF SUCH LUXURIES ON FOOT I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT SIR FRANCIS AUSTEN WHEN SEVEN YEARS OLD
2391-145015-0109 BOUGHT ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT IT MUST BE SUPPOSED WITH HIS FATHER'S PERMISSION A PONY FOR A GUINEA AND A HALF AND AFTER RIDING HIM WITH GREAT SUCCESS FOR TWO SEASONS SOLD HIM FOR A GUINEA MORE
2391-145015-0110 THE SAME AUTHORITY INFORMS ME THAT HIS FIRST CLOTH SUIT WAS MADE FROM A SCARLET HABIT WHICH ACCORDING TO THE FASHION OF THE TIMES HAD BEEN HIS MOTHER'S USUAL MORNING DRESS IF ALL THIS IS TRUE
2391-145015-0111 THE FUTURE ADMIRAL OF THE BRITISH FLEET MUST HAVE CUT A CONSPICUOUS FIGURE IN THE HUNTING FIELD THE OTHER PECULIARITY WAS THAT WHEN THE ROADS WERE DIRTY THE SISTERS TOOK LONG WALKS IN PATTENS THIS DEFENCE AGAINST WET AND DIRT IS NOW SELDOM SEEN
2391-145015-0112 THE FEW THAT REMAIN ARE BANISHED FROM GOOD SOCIETY AND EMPLOYED ONLY IN MENIAL WORK BUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO THEY WERE CELEBRATED IN POETRY AND CONSIDERED SO CLEVER A CONTRIVANCE THAT GAY IN HIS TRIVIA
2391-145015-0113 ASCRIBES THE INVENTION TO A GOD STIMULATED BY HIS PASSION FOR A MORTAL DAMSEL AND DERIVES THE NAME PATTEN FROM PATTY THE PATTEN NOW SUPPORTS EACH FRUGAL DAME WHICH FROM THE BLUE EYED PATTY TAKES THE NAME
2391-145015-0114 BUT MORTAL DAMSELS HAVE LONG AGO DISCARDED THE CLUMSY IMPLEMENT FIRST IT DROPPED ITS IRON RING AND BECAME A CLOG AFTERWARDS IT WAS FINED DOWN INTO THE PLIANT GALOSHE LIGHTER TO WEAR AND MORE EFFECTUAL TO PROTECT
2391-145015-0115 A NO LESS MANIFEST INSTANCE OF GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT THAN COWPER INDICATES WHEN HE TRACES THROUGH EIGHTY LINES OF POETRY HIS ACCOMPLISHED SOFA BACK TO THE ORIGINAL THREE LEGGED STOOL
2391-145015-0116 I ADD THE FOLLOWING EPIGRAM WRITTEN BY JANE AUSTEN'S UNCLE MISTER LEIGH PERROT ON READING IN A NEWSPAPER THE MARRIAGE OF CAPTAIN FOOTE TO MISS PATTEN THROUGH THE ROUGH PATHS OF LIFE WITH A PATTEN YOUR GUARD MAY YOU SAFELY AND PLEASANTLY JOG
2391-145015-0117 MAY THE KNOT NEVER SLIP NOR THE RING PRESS TOO HARD NOR THE FOOT FIND THE PATTEN A CLOG AT THE TIME WHEN JANE AUSTEN LIVED AT STEVENTON A WORK WAS CARRIED ON IN THE NEIGHBOURING COTTAGES WHICH OUGHT TO BE RECORDED BECAUSE IT HAS LONG CEASED TO EXIST
2391-145015-0118 THIS WAS A BETTER OCCUPATION FOR THEM THAN STRAW PLAITING
2391-145015-0119 AND DID NOT ADMIT OF GADDING AND GOSSIPING ABOUT THE VILLAGE THE IMPLEMENT USED WAS A LONG NARROW MACHINE OF WOOD RAISED ON LEGS FURNISHED AT ONE END WITH A LARGE WHEEL AND AT THE OTHER WITH A SPINDLE ON WHICH THE FLAX OR WOOL WAS LOOSELY WRAPPED
2391-145015-0120 BALLAD POETRY AND FAIRY TALES ARE FULL OF ALLUSIONS TO IT
2391-145015-0121 IT WAS THE LABOUR ASSIGNED TO THE EJECTED NUNS BY THE ROUGH EARL WHO SAID GO SPIN YE JADES GO SPIN IT WAS THE EMPLOYMENT AT WHICH ROMAN MATRONS AND GRECIAN PRINCESSES PRESIDED AMONGST THEIR HANDMAIDS
2391-145015-0122 HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY CELEBRATED IT IN THE THREE FATES SPINNING AND MEASURING OUT THE THREAD OF HUMAN LIFE
2416-152137-0000 A WHITE GLOVED ARM A VOICE AND A SILVERY LAUGH JUST THAT NO MORE JIMMIE DALE IN HIS FAVOURITE SEAT AN AISLE SEAT SOME SEVEN OR EIGHT ROWS BACK FROM THE ORCHESTRA STARED AT THE STAGE
2416-152137-0001 TO ALL OUTWARD APPEARANCES ABSORBED IN THE LAST ACT OF THE PLAY INWARDLY QUITE OBLIVIOUS TO THE FACT THAT EVEN A PLAY WAS GOING ON A WHITE GLOVED ARM A VOICE
2416-152137-0002 AND A SILVERY LAUGH THE WORDS HAD FORMED THEMSELVES INTO A SORT OF SINGSONG REFRAIN THAT FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS HAD BEEN RUNNING THROUGH HIS HEAD A STRANGE ENOUGH GUIDING STAR TO MOULD AND DICTATE EVERY ACTION IN HIS LIFE
2416-152137-0003 AND THAT WAS ALL HE HAD EVER SEEN OF HER ALL THAT HE HAD EVER HEARD OF HER EXCEPT THOSE LETTERS OF COURSE EACH OF WHICH HAD OUTLINED THE DETAILS OF SOME AFFAIR FOR THE GRAY SEAL TO EXECUTE
2416-152137-0004 INDEED IT SEEMED A GREAT LENGTH OF TIME NOW SINCE HE HAD HEARD FROM HER EVEN IN THAT WAY THOUGH IT WAS NOT SO MANY DAYS AGO AFTER ALL PERHAPS IT WAS THE CALM AS IT WERE THAT BY CONTRAST
2416-152137-0005 HAD GIVEN PLACE TO THE STRENUOUS MONTHS AND WEEKS JUST PAST THE STORM RAISED BY THE NEWSPAPERS AT THE THEFT OF OLD LUDDY'S DIAMONDS HAD SUBSIDED INTO SPORADIC DIATRIBES AIMED AT THE POLICE KLINE
2416-152137-0006 OF THE SECRET SERVICE HAD FINALLY ADMITTED DEFEAT AND A SHADOW NO LONGER SKULKED DAY AND NIGHT AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE SANCTUARY AND LARRY THE BAT BORE THE GOVERNMENT INDORSEMENT SO TO SPEAK OF BEING NO MORE SUSPICIOUS A CHARACTER
2416-152137-0007 THAN THAT OF A DISREPUTABLE BUT HARMLESS DOPE FIEND OF THE UNDERWORLD LARRY THE BAT THE GRAY SEAL JIMMIE DALE THE MILLIONAIRE
2416-152137-0008 SUBCONSCIOUSLY TELEGRAPHING TO HIS MIND THE FACT THAT THE TEXTURE OF THE PAPER WAS HERS HERS AND SHE MUST BE ONE OF THOSE AROUND HIM ONE OF THOSE CROWDING EITHER THE ROW OF SEATS IN FRONT OR BEHIND
2416-152137-0009 OR ONE OF THOSE JUST PASSING IN THE AISLE IT HAD FALLEN AT HIS FEET AS HE HAD STOOPED OVER FOR HIS HAT BUT FROM JUST EXACTLY WHAT DIRECTION HE COULD NOT TELL HIS EYES EAGERLY HUNGRILY
2416-152137-0010 CRITICALLY SWEPT FACE AFTER FACE WHICH ONE WAS HERS WHAT IRONY SHE WHOM HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIS LIFE TO KNOW FOR WHOM INDEED HE RISKED HIS LIFE EVERY HOUR OF THE TWENTY FOUR
2416-152137-0011 WAS CLOSE TO HIM NOW WITHIN REACH AND AS FAR REMOVED AS THOUGH A THOUSAND MILES SEPARATED THEM SHE WAS THERE BUT HE COULD NOT RECOGNISE A FACE THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN
2416-152137-0012 WITH AN EFFORT HE CHOKED BACK THE BITTER IMPOTENT LAUGH THAT ROSE TO HIS LIPS THEY WERE TALKING LAUGHING AROUND HIM HER VOICE YES
2416-152137-0013 HE HAD ONCE HEARD THAT AND THAT HE WOULD RECOGNISE AGAIN HE STRAINED TO CATCH TO INDIVIDUALISE THE TONE SOUNDS THAT FLOATED IN A MEDLEY ABOUT HIM IT WAS USELESS OF COURSE
2416-152137-0014 EVERY EFFORT THAT HE HAD EVER MADE TO FIND HER HAD BEEN USELESS SHE WAS TOO CLEVER FAR TOO CLEVER FOR THAT SHE TOO WOULD KNOW THAT HE COULD AND WOULD RECOGNISE HER VOICE WHERE HE COULD RECOGNISE NOTHING ELSE
2416-152137-0015 AND THEN SUDDENLY HE REALISED THAT HE WAS ATTRACTING ATTENTION LEVEL STARES FROM THE WOMEN RETURNED HIS GAZE
2416-152137-0016 OTHERS IN THE SAME ROW OF SEATS AS HIS OWN WERE IMPATIENTLY WAITING TO GET BY HIM WITH A MUTTERED APOLOGY JIMMIE DALE RAISED THE SEAT OF HIS CHAIR ALLOWING THESE LATTER TO PASS HIM AND THEN
2416-152137-0017 SLIPPING THE LETTER INTO HIS POCKETBOOK HE SNATCHED UP HIS HAT FROM THE SEAT RACK THERE WAS STILL A CHANCE KNOWING HE WAS THERE SHE WOULD BE ON HER GUARD BUT IN THE LOBBY AMONG THE CROWD AND UNAWARE OF HIS PRESENCE
2416-152137-0018 THERE WAS THE POSSIBILITY THAT IF HE COULD REACH THE ENTRANCE AHEAD OF HER SHE TOO MIGHT BE TALKING AND LAUGHING AS SHE LEFT THE THEATRE JUST A SINGLE WORD JUST A TONE THAT WAS ALL HE ASKED
2416-152137-0019 TIGHT PACKED THE MASS OF PEOPLE JOSTLED ELBOWED AND PUSHED GOOD NATUREDLY IT WAS A VOICE NOW HER VOICE THAT HE WAS LISTENING FOR BUT THOUGH IT SEEMED THAT EVERY FACULTY WAS STRAINED AND INTENT UPON THAT ONE EFFORT
2416-152137-0020 HIS EYES TOO HAD IN NO DEGREE RELAXED THEIR VIGILANCE AND ONCE HALF GRIMLY HALF SARDONICALLY HE SMILED TO HIMSELF
2416-152137-0021 WITH THEIR PROSPEROUS WELL GROOMED ESCORTS THERE WAS THE WOWZER OVER THERE SLEEK DAPPER SQUIRMING IN AND OUT OF THE THRONG WITH THE AGILITY AND STEALTH OF A CAT AS LARRY THE BAT HE HAD MET THE WOWZER MANY TIMES
2416-152137-0022 AS INDEED HE HAD MET AND WAS ACQUAINTED WITH MOST OF THE ELITE OF THE UNDERWORLD THE WOWZER BEYOND A SHADOW OF DOUBT IN HIS OWN PROFESSION STOOD UPON A PLANE ENTIRELY BY HIMSELF AMONG THOSE QUALIFIED TO SPEAK
2416-152137-0023 POKE GETTER IN THE UNITED STATES THE CROWD THINNED IN THE LOBBY THINNED DOWN TO THE LAST FEW BELATED STRAGGLERS WHO PASSED HIM AS HE STILL LOITERED IN THE ENTRANCE
2416-152137-0024 AND DISAPPOINTMENT THAT BURNED WITHIN HIM STEPPED OUT TO THE PAVEMENT AND HEADED DOWN BROADWAY AFTER ALL HE HAD KNOWN IT IN HIS HEART OF HEARTS ALL THE TIME IT HAD
2416-152137-0025 ALWAYS BEEN THE SAME IT WAS ONLY ONE MORE OCCASION ADDED TO THE INNUMERABLE ONES THAT HAD GONE BEFORE IN WHICH SHE HAD ELUDED HIM AND NOW THERE WAS THE LETTER
2416-152137-0026 AUTOMATICALLY HE QUICKENED HIS STEPS A LITTLE IT WAS USELESS FUTILE PROFITLESS FOR THE MOMENT AT LEAST TO DISTURB HIMSELF OVER HIS FAILURE THERE WAS THE LETTER
2416-152137-0027 WHAT SUDDEN EMERGENCY WAS THE GRAY SEAL CALLED UPON TO FACE THIS TIME WHAT ROLE UNREHEARSED WITHOUT WARNING MUST HE PLAY WHAT STORY OF GRIM
2416-152137-0028 JIMMIE DALE A BLOCK DOWN HE TURNED FROM BROADWAY OUT OF THE THEATRE CROWDS THAT STREAMED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS PAST HIM THE LETTER
2416-152137-0029 ALMOST FEVERISHLY NOW HE WAS SEEKING AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN AND READ IT UNOBSERVED AN EAGERNESS UPON HIM THAT MINGLED EXHILARATION AT THE LURE OF DANGER WITH A SENSE OF PREMONITION THAT IRRITABLY
2416-152137-0030 INEVITABLY WAS WITH HIM AT MOMENTS SUCH AS THESE IT SEEMED IT ALWAYS SEEMED THAT WITH AN UNOPENED LETTER OF HERS IN HIS POSSESSION IT WAS AS THOUGH HE WERE ABOUT TO OPEN A PAGE IN THE BOOK OF FATE AND READ
2416-152137-0031 A PRONOUNCEMENT UPON HIMSELF THAT MIGHT MEAN LIFE OR DEATH HE HURRIED ON PEOPLE STILL PASSED BY HIM TOO MANY AND THEN A CAFE JUST AHEAD
2416-152137-0032 MAKING A CORNER GAVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY THAT HE SOUGHT AWAY FROM THE ENTRANCE ON THE SIDE STREET THE BRILLIANT LIGHTS FROM THE WINDOWS SHONE OUT ON A COMPARATIVELY DESERTED PAVEMENT
2416-152137-0033 THERE WAS AMPLE LIGHT TO READ BY EVEN AS FAR AWAY FROM THE WINDOW AS THE CURB AND JIMMIE DALE WITH AN APPROVING NOD TURNED THE CORNER AND WALKED ALONG A FEW STEPS UNTIL OPPOSITE THE FARTHEST WINDOW BUT
2416-152137-0034 AS HE HALTED HERE AT THE EDGE OF THE STREET HE GLANCED QUICKLY BEHIND HIM AT A MAN WHOM HE HAD JUST PASSED THE OTHER HAD PAUSED AT THE CORNER AND WAS STARING DOWN THE STREET JIMMIE DALE INSTANTLY AND NONCHALANTLY PRODUCED HIS CIGARETTE CASE
2416-152137-0035 SELECTED A CIGARETTE AND FASTIDIOUSLY TAPPED ITS END ON HIS THUMB NAIL INSPECTOR BURTON IN PLAIN CLOTHES HE OBSERVED MUSINGLY TO HIMSELF I WONDER IF IT'S JUST A FLUKE
2416-152137-0036 OR SOMETHING ELSE WE'LL SEE JIMMIE DALE TOOK A BOX OF MATCHES FROM HIS POCKET THE FIRST WOULD NOT LIGHT
2416-152139-0000 HE SURVEYED THE HOUSE FROM THE SIDEWALK WATCHING WITH A SORT OF SPECULATIVE SATISFACTION A MAN'S SHADOW THAT PASSED CONSTANTLY TO AND FRO ACROSS THE DRAWN BLINDS OF ONE OF THE LOWER WINDOWS
2416-152139-0001 THE REST OF THE HOUSE WAS IN DARKNESS YES SAID JIMMIE DALE NODDING HIS HEAD I RATHER THOUGHT SO THE SERVANTS WILL HAVE RETIRED HOURS AGO IT'S SAFE ENOUGH
2416-152139-0002 I WANT TO SEE MISTER THOMAS H CARLING CASHIER OF THE HUDSON MERCANTILE NATIONAL BANK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT SAID JIMMIE DALE EARNESTLY I AM MISTER CARLING REPLIED THE OTHER WHAT IS IT

2416-152139-0004 THOUGH I EXPECTED YOU WOULD TELEPHONE RATHER THAN THIS COME IN THANK YOU SAID JIMMIE DALE COURTEOUSLY AND STEPPED INTO THE HALL THE OTHER CLOSED THE FRONT DOOR THE SERVANTS ARE IN BED OF COURSE
2416-152139-0005 HE EXPLAINED AS HE LED THE WAY TOWARD THE LIGHTED ROOM THIS WAY PLEASE BEHIND THE OTHER ACROSS THE HALL JIMMIE DALE FOLLOWED AND CLOSE AT CARLING'S HEELS ENTERED THE ROOM WHICH WAS FITTED UP
2416-152139-0006 QUITE EVIDENTLY REGARDLESS OF COST AS A COMBINATION LIBRARY AND STUDY CARLING IN A SOMEWHAT POMPOUS FASHION WALKED STRAIGHT AHEAD TOWARD THE CARVED MAHOGANY FLAT TOPPED DESK AND AS HE REACHED IT
2416-152139-0007 WAVED HIS HAND TAKE A CHAIR HE SAID OVER HIS SHOULDER AND THEN TURNING IN THE ACT OF DROPPING INTO HIS OWN CHAIR GRASPED SUDDENLY AT THE EDGE OF THE DESK INSTEAD
2416-152139-0008 AND WITH A LOW STARTLED CRY STARED ACROSS THE ROOM JIMMIE DALE WAS LEANING BACK AGAINST THE DOOR THAT WAS CLOSED NOW BEHIND HIM AND ON JIMMIE DALE'S FACE WAS A BLACK SILK MASK
2416-152139-0009 FOR AN INSTANT NEITHER MAN SPOKE NOR MOVED THEN CARLING SPARE BUILT DAPPER IN EVENING CLOTHES EDGED BACK FROM THE DESK AND LAUGHED A LITTLE UNCERTAINLY
2416-152139-0010 AS HE SMILED IN PRIVATE YOU'VE A STRANGE METHOD OF SECURING PRIVACY HAVEN'T YOU A BIT MELODRAMATIC ISN'T IT
2416-152139-0011 JIMMIE DALE SMILED INDULGENTLY MY MASK IS ONLY FOR EFFECT HE SAID MY NAME IS SMITH YES SAID CARLING I AM VERY STUPID THANK YOU
2416-152139-0012 HE HAD REACHED THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM NOW AND WITH A QUICK SUDDEN MOVEMENT JERKED HIS HAND TO THE DIAL OF THE SAFE THAT STOOD AGAINST THE WALL BUT JIMMIE DALE WAS QUICKER WITHOUT SHIFTING HIS POSITION HIS AUTOMATIC WHIPPED FROM HIS POCKET

2416-152139-0015 EXTRACTED THE KEY FROM THE DOOR LOCK HELD IT UP FOR THE OTHER TO SEE THEN DROPPED IT INTO HIS POCKET AND HIS VOICE COLD BEFORE
2416-152139-0016 JIMMIE DALE MOVED OVER AND STOOD IN FRONT OF CARLING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DESK AND STARED SILENTLY AT THE IMMACULATE FASHIONABLY GROOMED FIGURE BEFORE HIM UNDER THE PROLONGED GAZE CARLING'S COMPOSURE
2416-152139-0017 IN A MEASURE AT LEAST SEEMED TO FORSAKE HIM HE BEGAN TO DRUM NERVOUSLY WITH HIS FINGERS ON THE DESK AND SHIFT UNEASILY IN HIS CHAIR AND THEN FROM FIRST ONE POCKET AND THEN THE OTHER
2416-152139-0018 SAID JIMMIE DALE SLOWLY I HAVEN'T COUNTED IT YOUR BANK WAS ROBBED THIS EVENING AT CLOSING TIME I UNDERSTAND YES CARLING'S VOICE WAS EXCITED NOW
