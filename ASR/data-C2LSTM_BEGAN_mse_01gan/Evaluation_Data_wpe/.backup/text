VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1410 THAT WAS BECAUSE HE CRAWLED INTO A CLUMP OF FERNS AND KEPT VERY STILL HIS SISTER CAME AND LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID NOW IF YOU WERE ONLY A SPIDER IT WOULD NOT BE LONG BEFORE YOU WOULD HAVE SIX LEGS AGAIN 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1411 BUT WHAT APPEARED TO THE CURATE A LONG SILENCE FOLLOWED AT LENGTH SHE SAID WITH FALTERING VOICE SUPPOSE IT WERE A GREAT WRONG THAT HAD BEEN DONE AND THAT WAS THE UNENDURABLE THOUGHT SUPPOSE I SAY 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1412 INDEED WAS SHE NOT CERTAIN THAT SUCH A MAN BRINGING THE ARTILLERY OF HIS FANATICISM TO BEAR UPON HER POOR BOY'S WILD ENTHUSIASTIC TEMPERAMENT WOULD SPEEDILY PERSUADE HIM TO MAKE A REALITY OF THAT TERRIBLE THING HE HAD ALREADY THOUGHT OF THAT HIDEOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBILITY 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1413 BUT AT HIS HEAD STOOD ONE WHO WATCHED HIS THROES WITH THE THROBS OF SUCH A HUMAN HEART AS NEVER BEAT IN ANY BOSOM BUT HIS OWN AND THE EXECUTIONERS WERE ANGELS OF LIGHT NO WONDER IF WITH SUCH A FEELING IN HIS BREAST WINGFOLD WALKED SOFTLY AND HIS FACE GLISTENED 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1414 AND THEN SAT DOWN UNTIL IT SHOULD STOP ACHING WAIT FOR ME HE CALLED OUT TO HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS I'M COMING IN A MINUTE THE OTHER LITTLE TURTLES WAITED BUT WHEN HIS TOE WAS COMFORTABLE AGAIN AND HE STARTED TOWARD THEM HE MET A VERY INTERESTING SNAIL

VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1417 MANY REMITTANCES CAME FOR THE HELP OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE FROM ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND AND AT ONE TIME AN EXTENSIVE INVOICE OF USEFUL AND FANCY ARTICLES IN SEVERAL LARGE BOXES WAS RECEIVED FROM THE GLASGOW LADIES SUFFICIENT TO FURNISH A LARGE BAZAAR OR FAIR 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1418 BUT THEN HE HAD A WEAKNESS FOR CONCERTS AND GENERAL SOCIETY BECAUSE HE WAS HELD TO BE BY ALL ODDS THE HANDSOMEST BIRD IN THE WOODS AND SUNG LIKE AN ANGEL AND SO THE TRUTH WAS HE DIDN'T CONFINE HIMSELF SO MUCH TO THE DOMESTIC NEST AS TOM TITMOUSE OR BILLY WREN 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1419 I SMILED AS I THANKED HER AH YOU THINK BECAUSE I'M SUCH A TOM BOY THAT I COULDN'T NURSE YOU I ONLY WISH I HAD HAD A CHANCE OF LETTING YOU SEE I AM SO SORRY FOR YOU BUT I'M NEARLY WELL NOW JUDY AND I HAVE BEEN TAKEN GOOD CARE OF

VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1423 THROUGH KIRKBY LONSDALE ON WE DROVE THE WEARY RAIN CLOUDS STILL ABOVE UNTIL AT LAST AT WINDERMERE WE FELT OUR FINAL PORT WAS NEAR THENCE THE LAKE WITH WOODED BEACH STRETCHES FAR AS EYE CAN REACH 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1424 NOT A THOUGHT TO BREAK OUR LEISURE DRIFTING ON FROM SUSSEX HEDGES UP THROUGH YORKSHIRE'S FELLS AND LEDGES PAST THE DESERTS AND MORASSES OF THE DREARY BORDER PASSES 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1425 OR AN EARTHLY ELIGIBLE WITH MONEY AND A HEART ANTI ROOMS EUPHEMISTIC TERM FOR CANFIELD'S NEW YORK CITY ANTI IMPERIALIST A PATRIOT WHOSE CONSCIENCE WORKS OVERTIME 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1426 IT IS NOT THE STRENGTH BUT THE DURATION OF GREAT SENTIMENTS THAT MAKES GREAT MEN SEVENTY THREE HE WHO ATTAINS HIS IDEAL PRECISELY THEREBY SURPASSES IT SEVENTY THREE A 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1427 IS NOT SOMETHING DREADFUL ALSO NINETY HEAVY MELANCHOLY MEN TURN LIGHTER AND COME TEMPORARILY TO THEIR SURFACE PRECISELY BY THAT WHICH MAKES OTHERS HEAVY BY HATRED AND LOVE 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1428 IN INTERCOURSE WITH SCHOLARS AND ARTISTS ONE READILY MAKES MISTAKES OF OPPOSITE KINDS IN A REMARKABLE SCHOLAR ONE NOT INFREQUENTLY FINDS A MEDIOCRE MAN AND OFTEN EVEN IN A MEDIOCRE ARTIST 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1429 WHERE THAT IS NOT OBVIOUS HENCE THERE IS NO ROOM FOR CHARACTER IN A SPEECH ON A PURELY INDIFFERENT SUBJECT THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND IS SHOWN IN ALL THEY SAY WHEN PROVING OR DISPROVING SOME PARTICULAR POINT 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1430 A SIZE TO BE TAKEN IN BY THE EYE SO A STORY OR PLOT MUST BE OF SOME LENGTH BUT OF A LENGTH TO BE TAKEN IN BY THE MEMORY AS FOR THE LIMIT OF ITS LENGTH SO FAR AS THAT IS RELATIVE TO PUBLIC PERFORMANCES AND SPECTATORS 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1431 YET IN THEIR PERIPETIES AS ALSO IN THEIR SIMPLE PLOTS THE POETS I MEAN SHOW WONDERFUL SKILL IN AIMING AT THE KIND OF EFFECT THEY DESIRE A TRAGIC SITUATION THAT AROUSES THE HUMAN FEELING IN ONE LIKE THE CLEVER VILLAIN 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1432 AS LONG SHORT OR OF VARIABLE QUANTITY AND FURTHER AS HAVING AN ACUTE GRAVE OR INTERMEDIATE ACCENT THE DETAILS OF THESE MATTERS WE MUST LEAVE TO THE METRICIANS 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1433 THAT FROM SPECIES TO GENUS IN TRULY TEN THOUSAND GOOD DEEDS HAS ULYSSES WROUGHT WHERE TEN THOUSAND WHICH IS A PARTICULAR LARGE NUMBER IS PUT IN PLACE OF THE GENERIC A LARGE NUMBER

VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1437 TO EVERY ONE OF THEM MADAM THAT IS NOT MY NAME THE THIRD DAY ONE OF THE MESSENGERS CAME BACK AND SAID I HAVE TRAVELLED TWO DAYS WITHOUT HEARING OF ANY OTHER NAMES BUT YESTERDAY AS I WAS CLIMBING A HIGH HILL 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1438 I SAW A LITTLE HUT AND BEFORE THE HUT BURNT A FIRE AND ROUND ABOUT THE FIRE A FUNNY LITTLE DWARF WAS DANCING UPON ONE LEG AND SINGING MERRILY THE FEAST I'LL MAKE TODAY I'LL BREW TOMORROW BAKE 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1439 JERRY BARKER I NEVER KNEW A BETTER MAN THAN MY NEW MASTER HE WAS KIND AND GOOD AND AS STRONG FOR THE RIGHT AS JOHN MANLY AND SO GOOD TEMPERED AND MERRY THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE COULD PICK A QUARREL WITH HIM

VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1443 YOU HE SAID IN THE BOAT HE WAS A MAN THEN AT LEAST AS MUCH OF A MAN AS MONTGOMERY'S ATTENDANT FOR HE COULD TALK YES I SAID I CAME IN THE BOAT FROM THE SHIP OH HE SAID 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1444 CARBONIFEROUS DEVONIAN SILURIAN OR PRIMITIVE WAS ALL ONE TO ME BUT THE PROFESSOR NO DOUBT WAS PURSUING HIS OBSERVATIONS OR TAKING NOTES FOR IN ONE OF OUR HALTS HE SAID TO ME THE FARTHER I GO THE MORE CONFIDENCE I FEEL 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1445 THIS GAVE REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT OUR DESCENT WAS MORE HORIZONTAL THAN VERTICAL AS FOR THE EXACT DEPTH REACHED IT WAS VERY EASY TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE PROFESSOR MEASURED ACCURATELY THE ANGLES OF DEVIATION AND INCLINATION ON THE ROAD BUT HE KEPT THE RESULTS TO HIMSELF 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1446 BY MANY PASSAGES HAD NOT CEASED WHEN LUCIE STOOD STRETCHING OUT HER ARMS TOWARDS HER HUSBAND WITH NOTHING IN HER FACE BUT LOVE AND CONSOLATION IF I MIGHT TOUCH HIM IF I MIGHT EMBRACE HIM ONCE O GOOD CITIZENS IF YOU WOULD HAVE SO MUCH COMPASSION FOR US 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1447 BUT I WILL DO MY DUTY WHILE I CAN AND WHEN I LEAVE HER GOD WILL RAISE UP FRIENDS FOR HER AS HE DID FOR ME HER FATHER HAD FOLLOWED HER AND WOULD HAVE FALLEN ON HIS KNEES TO BOTH OF THEM BUT THAT DARNAY PUT OUT A HAND AND SEIZED HIM CRYING NO NO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WHAT HAVE YOU DONE 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1448 WOODROOF AND ANEMONIES GREW ALMOST TOO HIGH BLOOMING CONVOLVULUSES AND BLACKBERRY BUSHES HUNG IN LONG GARLANDS FROM TREE TO TREE WHERE THE NIGHTINGALE SANG AND THE SUNBEAMS WERE PLAYING IT WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT IT WAS NO PLACE FOR GIRLS TO GO 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1449 BUT THE DEEP SOUND OF THE BELL ROSE LOUDER IT WAS ALMOST AS IF AN ORGAN WERE ACCOMPANYING IT AND THE TONES CAME FROM THE LEFT HAND THE SIDE WHERE THE HEART IS PLACED A RUSTLING WAS HEARD IN THE BUSHES AND A LITTLE BOY STOOD BEFORE THE KING'S SON 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1450 FROM THEN ON WE TRAVEL BY LAND UNTIL WELL UNTIL YOU GET TO THE PLACE WHERE YOU ARE GOING I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS HE ADDED NODDING TOWARD THE PROFESSOR I AM LEAVING THAT PART TO YOU OH I HAVE A MAP SHOWING WHERE I WANT TO BEGIN SOME EXCAVATIONS WAS THE ANSWER

VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1457 BUT THE ELDEST SAID IT IS ONLY OUR PRINCES WHO ARE SHOUTING FOR JOY AT OUR APPROACH THEN THEY CAME TO ANOTHER GROVE OF TREES WHERE ALL THE LEAVES WERE OF GOLD AND AFTERWARDS TO A THIRD WHERE THE LEAVES WERE ALL GLITTERING DIAMONDS 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1458 NOW ALL IS QUITE SAFE THEN THEY UNDRESSED THEMSELVES PUT AWAY THEIR FINE CLOTHES PULLED OFF THEIR SHOES AND WENT TO BED IN THE MORNING THE SOLDIER SAID NOTHING ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1459 THAN STATE GOVERNMENTS OR SEPARATE CONFEDERACIES CAN POSSIBLY DO FOR WANT OF CONCERT AND UNITY OF SYSTEM IT CAN PLACE THE MILITIA UNDER ONE PLAN OF DISCIPLINE AND BY PUTTING THEIR OFFICERS IN A PROPER LINE OF SUBORDINATION TO THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE

VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1468 HE TOLD MISSUS ARBUTHNOT AS A MATTER OF HONOUR NOT TO MENTION IT AND AT LEAST HER LITTLE HOUSE WAS NOT HAUNTED BY THE LOOSE LIVED LADIES FOR FREDERICK DID HIS WORK AWAY FROM HOME HE HAD TWO ROOMS NEAR THE BRITISH MUSEUM 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1469 WHEN SHE HERSELF WAS SPENDING SO MUCH ON HER OWN SELFISH PLEASURE NOR DID IT HELP HER OR QUIET HER THAT HAVING ACTUALLY TOLD FREDERICK IN HER DESIRE TO MAKE UP FOR WHAT SHE WAS SQUANDERING THAT SHE WOULD BE GRATEFUL 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1470 THERE WAS NO REASON WHY SHE SHOULD HE WOULD NOT BE INTERESTED HE WOULD NOT CARE THE DAY WAS WRETCHED BLUSTERING AND WET THE CROSSING WAS ATROCIOUS AND THEY WERE VERY SICK 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1471 THERE WAS NO REASON WHY SHE SHOULD HE WOULD NOT BE INTERESTED HE WOULD NOT CARE THE DAY WAS WRETCHED BLUSTERING AND WET THE CROSSING WAS ATROCIOUS AND THEY WERE VERY SICK

VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1477 HE ACQUIRES NO MUSCLE IN HIS SOUL NO STRENGTH OF CHARACTER NO VIGOR OF MORAL FIBRE NO BEAUTY OF SPIRITUAL GROWTH LOVE IS NOT A THING OF ENTHUSIASTIC EMOTION 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1478 HIS ELEVATION ABOVE EVERYONE THE IDENTITY OF HIS SOBER INTERESTS WITH THOSE OF THE STATE AT LARGE IS CALCULATED TO MAKE HIM THE PEOPLE'S NATURAL REPRESENTATIVE HIS WORD HAS THEREFORE A GENUINE AUTHORITY AND HIS ASCENDENCY NOT BEING INVIDIOUS IS ABLE TO SECURE INTERNAL PEACE EVEN WHEN NOT ENLIGHTENED ENOUGH TO INSURE PROSPERITY OR TO AVOID FOREIGN WARS 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1479 AND ITS BEST PRODUCTS ARE THE FIRST TO BE LOST SO THAT VERY LIKELY THE DUMB FORCES OF SOCIETY HUNGER CONSCIENCE AND MALICE WILL NOT DO ANY GREAT HARM WHEN THEY DESTROY THOSE TREACHEROUS INSTITUTIONS WHICH AFTER GIVING THE SPIRIT A MOMENTARY EXPRESSION HAD BECOME AN OFFENCE TO BOTH SPIRIT AND FLESH

VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_1492 THE SURPRISE OF THE RUSSIANS AND THE CONFUSION CONSEQUENT UPON IT WERE GREATLY INCREASED BY THE STATE OF THE WEATHER FOR THERE WAS A VIOLENT SNOW STORM AT THE TIME AND THE SNOW BLOWING INTO THE RUSSIANS FACES PREVENTED THEIR SEEING WHAT THE NUMBERS WERE OF THE ENEMY SO SUDDENLY ASSAULTING THEM

VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2019 THE POET'S AIM THEN SHOULD BE TO COMBINE EVERY ELEMENT OF INTEREST IF POSSIBLE OR ELSE THE MORE IMPORTANT AND THE MAJOR PART OF THEM THIS IS NOW ESPECIALLY NECESSARY OWING TO THE UNFAIR CRITICISM TO WHICH THE POET IS SUBJECTED IN THESE DAYS

VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2027 WHICH I KNEW THAT WE HAD REPEATED FOURTEEN TIMES EACH DESCENT OCCUPYING HALF AN HOUR THE CONCLUSION WAS EASY THAT WE HAD BEEN SEVEN HOURS PLUS FOURTEEN QUARTERS OF REST MAKING TEN HOURS AND A HALF WE HAD STARTED AT ONE IT MUST THEREFORE NOW BE ELEVEN O'CLOCK 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2028 HANS CARRIED THE OTHER APPARATUS WHICH WAS ALSO PUT INTO ACTION THIS INGENIOUS APPLICATION OF ELECTRICITY WOULD ENABLE US TO GO ON FOR A LONG TIME BY CREATING AN ARTIFICIAL LIGHT EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST INFLAMMABLE GASES NOW MARCH CRIED MY UNCLE

VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2035 BUT THE DEEP SOUND OF THE BELL ROSE LOUDER IT WAS ALMOST AS IF AN ORGAN WERE ACCOMPANYING IT AND THE TONES CAME FROM THE LEFT HAND THE SIDE WHERE THE HEART IS PLACED A RUSTLING WAS HEARD IN THE BUSHES AND A LITTLE BOY STOOD BEFORE THE KING'S SON 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2036 THOUGH WE HAD HARD ENOUGH WORK IN THAT TUNNEL DIGGING AFTER BREAKFAST WHILE THE INDIANS WERE MAKING READY THE CANOES PROFESSOR BUMPER WHO IN A PREVIOUS VISIT TO CENTRAL AMERICA HAD BECOME INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT MADE A BRIEF EXAMINATION OF SOME OF THE DEAD BATS

VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2044 AND THERE CAME AGAIN FROM THE BLACK SHADOWS THE SOUND OF A MOVING THING AND A FAINT RUSTLING AS OF DEAD LEAVES THE SHOCK TO MY ALREADY OVERSTRAINED NERVOUS SYSTEM WAS TERRIBLE IN THE EXTREME AND WITH A SUPERHUMAN EFFORT I STROVE TO BREAK MY AWFUL BONDS 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2045 IT WAS AN EFFORT OF THE MIND OF THE WILL OF THE NERVES NOT MUSCULAR FOR I COULD NOT MOVE EVEN SO MUCH AS MY LITTLE FINGER BUT NONE THE LESS MIGHTY FOR ALL THAT AND THEN SOMETHING GAVE THERE WAS A MOMENTARY FEELING OF NAUSEA 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2046 THE FOREMOST VESSEL SWUNG BROADSIDE TOWARD US AND BRINGING HER GUNS INTO PLAY RETURNED OUR FIRE AT THE SAME TIME MOVING PARALLEL TO OUR FRONT FOR A SHORT DISTANCE AND THEN TURNING BACK WITH THE EVIDENT INTENTION OF COMPLETING A GREAT CIRCLE WHICH WOULD BRING HER UP TO POSITION ONCE MORE OPPOSITE OUR FIRING LINE 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2047 AS I DOUBT THAT HE WOULD CARE TO ENTRUST SUCH AS YOU WITH THE GRAVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF MATERNITY I SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH MY EXPRESSION OF INTEREST IN THIS RED WOMAN RETORTED SOLA SHE HAS NEVER HARMED US NOR WOULD SHE SHOULD WE HAVE FALLEN INTO HER HANDS

VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2057 HIS ELEVATION ABOVE EVERYONE THE IDENTITY OF HIS SOBER INTERESTS WITH THOSE OF THE STATE AT LARGE IS CALCULATED TO MAKE HIM THE PEOPLE'S NATURAL REPRESENTATIVE HIS WORD HAS THEREFORE A GENUINE AUTHORITY AND HIS ASCENDENCY NOT BEING INVIDIOUS IS ABLE TO SECURE INTERNAL PEACE EVEN WHEN NOT ENLIGHTENED ENOUGH TO INSURE PROSPERITY OR TO AVOID FOREIGN WARS 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2058 APPARENTLY CROSSED BY SOME THOUGHT WHICH JARS WITH THE SINGING PERHAPS IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN ALREADY IN THE SECRET YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE GUESSED WHAT SAD MEMORIES WHAT WARM AFFECTION WHAT TENDER FLUTTERING HOPES HAD THEIR HOME IN THIS ATHLETIC BODY WITH THE BROKEN FINGER NAILS 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2059 PAUL CHOSE LUELLA FOR LUELLA WAS THE NURSE WHO HAD BEEN WITH HIM DURING HIS WHOLE BABYHOOD UP TO THE TIME OF HIS FIRST TROUSERS AND THE NAME SUGGESTED ALL SORTS OF COMFORTABLE THINGS UNCLE JACK SAID THAT THE FIRST GIRL SHOULD ALWAYS BE NAMED FOR HER MOTHER NO MATTER HOW HIDEOUS THE NAME HAPPENED TO BE

VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2068 IN FORMER TIMES EVERY WOMAN WHO GAVE BIRTH TO A CHILD OR PASSED THROUGH A MISCARRIAGE WAS EXPOSED TO GRAVE DANGER OF INFECTION OR CHILD BED FEVER BUT AT PRESENT THANKS TO THE RECOGNITION OF THE BACTERIAL ORIGIN OF THE DISEASE AND OF ITS IDENTITY WITH WOUND INFECTION 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2069 FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE ALMOST TOTALLY IGNORANT OF THE STIMULUS WHICH CAUSES THE MOTHER TO FALL INTO LABOR APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS AFTER THE LAST NORMAL MENSTRUATION THERE ARE TWO POINTS WHICH I DESIRE TO IMPRESS ESPECIALLY UPON THE READERS OF THIS BOOK 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2070 AND HAS NOT EVEN MENTIONED A VERY PRETTY RING WHICH SHE WEARS SO I CONCLUDE THAT SHE HAS LEARNED TO THINK OF OTHER PEOPLE MORE AND OF HERSELF LESS AND HAS DECIDED TO TRY AND MOLD HER CHARACTER AS CAREFULLY AS SHE MOLDS HER LITTLE CLAY FIGURES 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2071 IN EXECUTING THIS PLAN NEGOTIATIONS WERE FIRST CAUTIOUSLY OPENED WITH THE GUARDS AND THEY READILY ACCEDED TO THE PROPOSALS MADE TO THEM A COMMITTEE OF THREE PERSONS WAS APPOINTED TO DRAW UP THE ADDRESS TO SOPHIA 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2072 THESE GRAND OFFICIALS WERE NOT REQUIRED HOWEVER TO DO MUCH HARD WORK AT ROWING FOR THERE WERE TWO SHALLOPS PROVIDED MANNED BY STRONG MEN TO TOW THE SKIFF IN THIS WAY THE SKIFF ROWED TO AND FRO OVER THE SEA AND THEN PASSED ALONG THE FLEET SALUTED EVERY WHERE 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2073 AT THE BOTTOM OF A GUN NINE HUNDRED FEET LONG AND UNDER THIS PROJECTILE ARE RAMMED FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS OF GUN COTTON WHICH IS EQUAL TO ONE MILLION SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS OF ORDINARY POWDER AND FRIEND MURCHISON 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2074 AND IF BY LEASE OF STRENGTH THEY PASS ON TOWARD AN AGE OF FOUR YEARS IT IS BUT AN EVIDENCE OF THEIR EXCEPTIONAL VITALITY IT SEEMS TO BE TRUE THAT THE EXPERIENCES OF A LONG LIFE OF SIXTY OR EIGHTY YEARS IS CROWDED INTO A NARROW COMPASS OF FOUR YEARS 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2075 RYNCH WATCHED DISPASSIONATELY BEFORE HE CAUGHT THE NEEDLER JERKING IT AWAY FROM THE PRISONER THE MAN EYED HIM STEADILY AND HIS EXPRESSION DID NOT ALTER EVEN WHEN RYNCH SWUNG THE OFF WORLD WEAPON TO CENTER ITS SIGHTS ON THE LATE OWNER 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2076 MORE THAN THE REVERENCE PAID BY THE PRELATIST TO THE ANCIENT HOLIDAYS OF THE CHURCH THAT SUCH REVERENCE MAY BE CARRIED TO AN ABSURD EXTREME IS TRUE BUT A PHILOSOPHER MAY PERHAPS BE INCLINED TO THINK THE OPPOSITE EXTREME NOT LESS ABSURD 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2077 ALL THE PLACE IS PEOPLED WITH SWEET AIRS ALL THE SKY WAS MOTHER OF PEARL AND TENDER ALL THE UNKNOWN OF THE NIGHT AND OF THE UNIVERSE WAS PRESSING UPON HIM

VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2081 THE GLOOM OF WINTER DWELT ON EVERYTHING THE GLOOMY INSOLENCE OF SELF CONCEIT THE GLOW OF THE AMBITIOUS FIRE THE GOLDEN GLOOM OF THE PAST AND THE BRIGHT HUED HOPE OF THE FUTURE 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2082 AND IF I COULD HINDER HIM FROM CROSSING THE ROAD AND GETTING AWAY INTO THE VALLEY BELOW WHERE THERE WAS A REGULAR WILDERNESS OF WOODS AND UNDERBRUSH IF HE DOES THAT I THOUGHT HE WILL BE GONE IN A MINUTE AND I SHALL LOSE HIM AND THE HUNT WILL BE OVER AND FOR FEAR HE WOULD MAKE FOR THE HEDGE AND JUMP OVER IT 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_2083 YOU'RE MISTAKEN THERE I SAID THERE ISN'T A TRUE ENGLISH WOMAN THAT LIVES WHO WOULD NOT HAVE DONE THE SAME THING YOUR MOTHER CONFOUND MY MOTHER YELLED THE MAN ALL RIGHT SAID I THAT'S ALL IN YOUR FAMILY AND NONE OF MY BUSINESS THEN HE WENT OFF RAGING TO WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIS HORSE BY A GATEPOST

VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_3850 WHEN THE CARRIAGE STOOD AT THE DOOR THEN A CURIOUS FEELING OF LONELINESS CAME UPON THE LITTLE BOY HIS MAMMA HAD BEEN SHUT UP IN HER ROOM FOR SOME TIME WHEN SHE CAME DOWN THE STAIRS HER EYES LOOKED LARGE AND WET AND HER SWEET MOUTH WAS TREMBLING 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_3851 IT SEEMED ALMOST DIRECTLY THEY WERE ON THE STEAMER IN THE MIDST OF THE WILDEST BUSTLE AND CONFUSION CARRIAGES WERE DRIVING DOWN AND LEAVING PASSENGERS PASSENGERS WERE GETTING INTO A STATE OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT BAGGAGE WHICH HAD NOT ARRIVED AND THREATENED TO BE TOO LATE

VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_3853 THERE IS BUT ONE QUESTION FOR HIM TO ANSWER TO FACE BOLDLY AND HONESTLY AS AN INDIVIDUAL ALONE WITH HIS CONSCIENCE AND HIS DESTINY HOW WILL I LET THAT POVERTY OR WEALTH AFFECT ME IF THAT TRIAL OR DEPRIVATION HAS LEFT ME BETTER

VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_3857 DRAWBACKS HOWEVER IT MUST ALWAYS BE UNDERSTOOD ARE USEFUL ONLY IN THOSE CASES IN WHICH THE GOODS FOR THE EXPORTATION OF WHICH THEY ARE GIVEN ARE REALLY EXPORTED TO SOME FOREIGN COUNTRY AND NOT CLANDESTINELY RE IMPORTED INTO OUR OWN 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_3858 NECESSARY OR USEFUL FOR SUPPLYING THEIR OCCASIONAL WANTS AND WHO CONTRIBUTE STILL FURTHER TO AUGMENT THE TOWN THE INHABITANTS OF THE TOWN AND THOSE OF THE COUNTRY ARE MUTUALLY THE SERVANTS OF ONE ANOTHER THE TOWN IS A CONTINUAL FAIR OR MARKET 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_3859 BUT SHE HAD EXPECTED TO VIEW THE COMPANY THROUGH A BOWER OF ORCHIDS AND EAT PRETTY COLOURED ENTREES IN RUFFLED PAPERS INSTEAD THERE WAS ONLY A LOW CENTRE DISH OF FERNS AND PLAIN ROASTED AND BROILED MEAT THAT ONE COULD RECOGNIZE AS IF THEY'D BEEN DYSPEPTICS ON A DIET 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_3860 THAT SHE COULD NOT BE SURE OF ITS BEING AS INDIFFERENT AS IT SOUNDED SHE LOOKED DOWN AT THE FRUIT ON HER PLATE AND SHOT A SIDE GLANCE THROUGH HER LASHES AT MISSUS PETER VAN DEGEN MISSUS VAN DEGEN WAS NEITHER BEAUTIFUL NOR IMPOSING JUST A DARK GIRLISH LOOKING CREATURE WITH PLAINTIVE EYES 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_3861 WALKING ABOUT THE STREETS AND SQUARES OR LOOKING OUT OF WINDOWS IN ORDER TO WITNESS THIS LONG TALKED OF PHENOMENON AND WHEN THE TOTAL OBSCURATION TOOK PLACE WHICH WAS INSTANTANEOUS THERE WAS A UNIVERSAL SHOUT FROM EVERY OBSERVER WHICH MADE THE WELKIN RING 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_3862 IS SELDOM SEEN WITH SO MUCH SPLENDOR I REMEMBER ANOTHER SIMILAR ONE SEEN FROM THE CITY OF NEW YORK IN NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO ON THIS LAST OCCASION SOME OBSERVERS SAW A GREAT UPRIGHT BEAM OF LIGHT WHICH MAJESTICALLY MOVED ACROSS THE HEAVENS 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_3863 OF THAT SAME BAR SHOE JUST AS DESCRIBED BY WEBB THEN WITH LONG SWIFT STRIDES HE CAME STALKING UP THE HILL AGAIN PASSING THE WATCHFUL EYES ABOUT THE CORRAL WITHOUT A STOP AND ONLY CHECKING SPEED AS HE NEARED THE HOMESTEAD OF THE HAYS 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_3864 WHERE ONCE AGAIN HE BECAME ENGROSSED IN STUDYING THE ROAD AND THE HARD PATHWAYS AT THE SIDE SOMETHING THAT HE SAW OR FANCIED THAT HE SAW PERHAPS A DOZEN YARDS FROM THE TRADER'S GATE INDUCED HIM TO STOP SCRUTINIZE TURN AND WITH SEARCHING EYES 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_3865 THAT ONE REASON PROBABLY WHY SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO OPPOSE NO STOUTER RESISTANCE TO SO SLENDER A GIRL AS ESTHER DADE WAS THAT SHE WAS ALREADY HALF DAZED THROUGH THE STROKE OF SOME BLUNT HEAVY WEAPON WIELDED PROBABLY BY HIM SHE WAS RISKING ALL TO SAVE 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_3866 BUT WHAT HE JUSTLY EARNS HIS WISHES AND PRAYERS ARE ONLY GRATIFIED AND ANSWERED WHEN THEY HARMONIZE WITH HIS THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS IN THE LIGHT OF THIS TRUTH WHAT THEN IS THE MEANING OF FIGHTING AGAINST CIRCUMSTANCES 
VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_3867 AND TRUE CONCENTRATION OF THOUGHT EVEN IF HE FAILS AGAIN AND AGAIN TO ACCOMPLISH HIS PURPOSE AS HE NECESSARILY MUST UNTIL WEAKNESS IS OVERCOME THE STRENGTH OF CHARACTER GAINED WILL BE THE MEASURE OF HIS TRUE SUCCESS

VOiCES_2019_Challenge_ASR_eval_3871 THEY KEEP THEIR OPINIONS HOWEVER GREATLY TO THEMSELVES INASMUCH AS MOST OF THEIR COUNTRYMEN FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THE GODS AND THEY HOLD IT WRONG TO GIVE PAIN UNLESS FOR SOME GREATER GOOD THAN SEEMS LIKELY TO ARISE FROM THEIR PLAIN SPEAKING
