c0ic022c THUS IT WASN'T IMMEDIATELY CLEAR WHY INTERNATIONAL THOMSON MIGHT BE LOOKING AT THE OPERATION EVEN THOUGH IT IS INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION
c0ic022d A SPOKESMAN FOR K. K. R. ALSO DECLINED COMMENT
c0ic022e HOWEVER HE LEAVES PRIME AT A DIFFICULT TIME
c0ic022f THE COMPUTER MARKET IS GROWING SLOWLY AND PRIME'S PROPRIETARY SYSTEMS ARE LOSING GROUND TO INDUSTRY STANDARD COMPUTERS THAT USE THE UNIX OPERATING SYSTEM
c0ic022h AS A RETIRED PHYSICIAN I REMAIN CONVINCED THAT THE FIFTY STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS CANNOT POLICE THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AS EFFECTIVELY AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDER ANTITRUST AUTHORITY
c0ic022i TOO MUCH IS AT STAKE TO BELIEVE OTHERWISE
c0ic022j I OPPOSE FEDERAL REGULATIONS IN PRINCIPLE EXCEPT WHERE SUCH A LARGE AMOUNT OF DISPOSABLE INCOME IS AT STAKE
c0jc0201 AS MODEST AS THE MEASURES ARE EVEN THEY WON'T BE ADOPTED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
c0jc0202 THE TAX CUTS ACCEPTED BY THE COALITION PARTIES HAVE BEEN LINKED TO CUTBACKS IN FEDERAL SUBSIDIES
c0jc0203 SUCH REDUCTIONS COULD RILE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS AND UNDERMINE PARLIAMENTARY SUPPORT FOR THE ENTIRE TAX PROGRAM
c0jc0204 MOREOVER ANY TAX REFORM MUST CLEAR PARLIAMENT'S UPPER HOUSE THE BUNDESRAT WHERE THE RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION CLINGS TO A MAJORITY
c0jc0205 SOME EXPERTS SAY THAT BECAUSE OF SWEEPING TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY COULDN'T BE RE REGULATED EVEN IF PEOPLE WANTED
c0jc0208 ALTHOUGH SUBSTANTIAL NEW TAXES ARE UNLIKELY THIS YEAR THE CURRENT DEBATE IS IMPORTANT
c0jc0209 DEMOCRATS LIKE HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER JAMES WRIGHT AND MAJORITY WHIP TONY COELHO BELIEVE THEY CAN CONVINCE AMERICANS THAT PRESIDENT REAGAN HAS BEEN TOO KIND TO THE RICH
c0jc020a HOW THAT POLITICAL STATEMENT IS RECEIVED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND HOW IT PLAYS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ELECTIONS COULD DETERMINE THE NATURE OF FUTURE TAX INCREASES
c0jc020b BUT SIX YEARS OF HUGE TRADE DEFICITS AND BUDGET DEFICITS HAVE CHANGED ALL THAT
c0jc020c BY THE END OF LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT SAYS FOREIGNERS HELD TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS MORE IN U. S. ASSETS THAN AMERICANS HELD OVERSEAS
c0jc020d SOME ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS DOUBT THE ACCURACY OF THOSE NUMBERS BUT NO ONE QUESTIONS THE TREND

c0jc020f THE FORMER INVESTOR RELATIONS OFFICIAL AT GULF OIL CORPORATION OWNED ONE THOUSAND SHARES OF THE PITTSBURGH OIL GIANT

c0jc0212 SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FRANK CARLUCCI HAS SAID I THINK A SMALLER MORE EFFECTIVE FORCE IS A MUCH BETTER DETERRENT THAN A LARGER LESS EFFECTIVE FORCE
c0jc0213 PROBABLY TRUE
c0jc0214 BUT THE BUDGET RULES OUT THE BEST OPTION WHICH IS A LARGER MORE EFFECTIVE FORCE
c0jc0215 MR. REAGAN VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED ATTORNEY GENERAL EDWIN MEESE WHO IS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR HIS ROLE IN ADVANCING A MIDDLE EAST OIL PIPELINE ADVOCATED BY ONE OF MR. MEESE'S FRIENDS

c0jc0219 IN ITS LAWSUITS AGAINST FORMER MANAGEMENT THE COMPANY IS SEEKING DAMAGES OF MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR ALLEGED SELF DEALING AND MISMANAGEMENT

c0jc021i <NOISE> BEFORE THE I. N. F. TREATY WE COULD HAVE COUNTERATTACKED THE SOVIET BASES WITH OUR PERSHING AND GROUND LAUNCHED CRUISE MISSILES G. L. C. M. S.'S
c0jc021j THE SOVIETS HAVE A PRODIGIOUS ANTIAIRCRAFT DEFENSE AND MIGHT COPE WITH MANY OF THE G. L. C. M.S
c0jc021k FOR NOW THOUGH THE PERSHINGS CAN'T BE STOPPED
c0jc021l BUT UNDER THE I. N. F. TREATY BOTH ARE TRADED AWAY
c0jc021m INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS LOOKING FOR SOME EXCITEMENT IN THEIR LIVES AREN'T LIKELY TO BE ENTHRALLED BY MR. BERG'S ADVICE
c0jc021n HE SUGGESTS THAT THEY DROP THEIR HARD EARNED DOLLARS INTO THE MOST CONSERVATIVE OF INVESTMENTS T. BILLS AND SIT TIGHT
c0jc021o THERE'S NO SENSE TRYING TO PLAY GAMES WITH THIS MARKET MR. BERG EXPLAINS
c0jc021p IT MAY BE TRUE THAT FIFTY MILLION FRENCHMEN CAN'T BE WRONG BUT FIFTY MAJOR FORECASTERS CAN BE
c0jc021q WHOSE FAULT IS IT THAT THESE FORECASTERS FAILED TO PREDICT THE STRONG GROWTH RATE IN FIRST QUARTER GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT
c0jc021r POOR GOVERNMENT STATISTICS ACCORDING TO THE WALL STREET JOURNAL SHAKY STATISTICS POSE PERIL FOR FORECASTERS THE OUTLOOK MAY NINTH
c0jc021s AND WHICH STATISTICAL SERIES MISLED THESE SEERS
c0jc021t THE INDEX OF LEADING INDICATORS WE ARE TOLD
c0jc021u MANY PARENTS IMPATIENT FOR CHANGE IN THE SCHOOLS RESPOND BY KEEPING THEIR KIDS OUT OF KINDERGARTEN AN EXTRA YEAR
c0jc021v MOTIVES ARE MIXED
c0jc021w SOME SAY THEY WANT TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN OTHERS ANGLE FOR AN AGE ADVANTAGE THAT WILL VAULT THEIR OFFSPRING TO THE HEAD OF THE CLASS THE FOLLOWING YEAR
c0jc021x MANY SCHOOLS ARE ENCOURAGING HOLDOUTS RESULTING IN WHAT SOME EDUCATORS CALL THE GRAYING OF KINDERGARTEN
c0jc021y TEXAS HAS BOTH WINNERS AND LOSERS THIS YEAR
c0jc021z ITS KIND OF A GOOD NEWS BAD NEWS YEAR SAYS RODNEY MOSIER EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT FOR THE TEXAS WHEAT PRODUCERS ASSOCIATION
c0jc0220 IN SEVERAL AREAS WHERE RAIN HAS BEEN AMPLE TEXAS WHEAT FARMERS HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED THE STATE'S TWENTY NINE BUSHEL PER ACRE AVERAGE
c0jc0221 IF YOU HAVE THE WHEAT THEN PRICES ARE TERRIFIC SAYS MR. MOSIER
c0jc0222 BUT THOSE FARMERS THAT AREN'T GETTING THE YIELDS BECAUSE OF THE DROUGHT LOSE OUT TWICE HE SAYS BECAUSE THE HIGH PRICES ARE CUTTING DOWN ON GOVERNMENT SUPPORT PAYMENTS
c0jc0223 FOR A. B. C. NOW NUMBER TWO A HIT WITH ROSEANNE COULD MEAN A TURNING POINT
c0jc0224 PRODUCER MARCY CARSEY SAYS SHE HAS THE SAME FEELING IN HER GUT AS SHE HAD BEFORE THE DEBUT OF COSBY
c0jc0225 BUT THERE THE SIMILARITY ENDS
c0jc0226 THE COSBY SHOW'S CLARE HUXTABLE IS A LOVING LAWYER AND MATRIARCH IN A TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR SWEATER
c0jc0227 ROSEANNE IS AN ACID TONGUED ASSEMBLY LINE WORKER IN AN OLD SWEATSHIRT

c0jc022a SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD THE PEACE IN DEATH THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE IN LIFE BUT FOR THIS BOOK AND ANOTHER ONE ABOUT HER DUE OUT SOON
c0jc022b WHILE SIGNIFICANT AFLATOXIN CONTAMINATION HAS BEEN FOUND REPEATEDLY IN THE SOUTHEAST OUTBREAKS HAVE BEEN RARE IN MOST MIDWEST STATES
c0jc022c AS A RESULT MOST MIDWEST STATES DON'T ROUTINELY TEST CORN FOR AFLATOXIN NOR DO THEY REQUIRE GRAIN MERCHANTS TO TEST FOR THE POISON
c0jc022d WHAT'S MORE MANY STATES SUCH AS SOUTH DAKOTA DON'T BAN THE SALE OF DANGEROUSLY CONTAMINATED CORN WITHIN THEIR BORDERS
c0jc022e <NOISE> OVERALL CONSUMER SPENDING HAS SLOWED SINCE LAST YEAR'S STOCK MARKET CRASH BUT IT'S STILL AT A LEVEL THAT WORRIES SOME ECONOMISTS
c0jc022f CONSUMER CREDIT SLOWED SHARPLY IN JULY REFLECTING SLUGGISH SALES
c0jc022g TOO MUCH SPENDING AT HOME COUPLED WITH HEAVY DEMAND FOR EXPORTS COULD OVERLOAD AN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THAT IS ALREADY RUNNING NEAR CAPACITY
c0jc022h ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COMMODITY COIN IS INDONESIA HURT BY WEAK PETROLEUM PRICES AND LAGGING AGRICULTURAL GROWTH
c0jc022i INDONESIA HAS BOOSTED NON OIL EXPORTS THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME OIL AND GAS WILL ACCOUNT FOR LESS THAN HALF THE NATION'S EXPORT EARNINGS
c0jc022j THE BRIGHT SPOT CONTINUES TO BE MANUFACTURED EXPORTS LED BY PLYWOOD AND TEXTILES
c0kc0201 AS EXPECTED THE BUDGET WILL INCLUDE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL LAST YEAR INCLUDING THE SALE OF THE NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE AND THE BONNEVILLE POWER ADMINISTRATION
c0kc0202 SOME ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESSIONAL AIDES THINK CONGRESS WILL GO ALONG WITH SELLING THE PETROLEUM RESERVE THIS YEAR
c0kc0203 BUT RESISTANCE TO THE BONNEVILLE IDEA WAS SO STRONG THAT LAWMAKERS PASSED A RESOLUTION PROHIBITING THE ADMINISTRATION FROM SPENDING ANY FEDERAL MONEY TO STUDY IT
c0kc0204 SUCH RESULTS ARE CAUSING SOME WALL STREET PROFESSIONALS TO TAKE THE JANUARY INDICATOR LESS SERIOUSLY THAN THEY USED TO
c0kc0205 I'M PUTTING LESS EMPHASIS ON SOME OF THESE TRADITIONAL BAROMETERS SAYS EUGENE PERONI DIRECTOR OF TECHNICAL RESEARCH FOR JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT INCORPORATED IN PHILADELPHIA
c0kc0206 THEY ARE NOT THE MOST SCIENTIFIC THINGS AROUND

c0kc0209 HE ESTIMATES HE HAS SOLD ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND COPIES
c0kc020a PAUL FREEDENBERG ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF COMMERCE FOR TRADE ADMINISTRATION TOLD THE SENATE PANEL THAT IRAN CONCEIVABLY COULD OBTAIN SIMILAR COMPUTERS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES
c0kc020b IRAN CAN GET THEM TOMORROW MORNING WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE HE CLAIMED
c0kc020c THE DIGITAL EQUIPMENT PACKAGE IS VALUED AT ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS
c0kc020d BUT OPTIMA WILL COMPETE HEAD ON
c0kc020e THE CARD WILL COST FIFTEEN DOLLARS A YEAR IN ADDITION TO THE FORTY FIVE DOLLARS THAT AMERICAN EXPRESS CHARGES FOR ITS REGULAR CARD
c0kc020f BUT IT WILL EXTEND THIRTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT CREDIT
c0kc020g THE AVERAGE VISA CARD ALSO CARRIES A FIFTEEN DOLLAR ANNUAL FEE BUT IT HAS A STIFFER SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT RATE AND SEVERAL BIG BANKS CHARGE EVEN MORE
c0kc020h NOW THE TWO UNITS ARE FOR SALE FOR FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MAYBE HALF THEIR PEAK VALUES OF THREE YEARS AGO

c0kc020q HE ADDED THAT THE PARAGRAPHS OF THE ORDER THAT WERE UPHELD CONTINUE TO PROHIBIT EMULEX FROM USING TRADE SECRETS THAT DIGITAL SAYS WERE STOLEN FROM IT
c0kc020r CLEARLY SOMETHING IS CHANGING IN EUROPE
c0kc020s IT ISN'T THAT THE WALL IS ABOUT TO FALL ANY TIME SOON
c0kc020t BUT THE SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH SERIOUS EUROPEANS DISCUSS THE PROSPECT VIVIDLY UNDERSCORES THE IMPACT ON WESTERN EUROPE OF MR. GORBACHEV AND HIS REFORM POLICIES
c0kc020u MR. HINZ SAID HOWEVER THAT MR. KEATING HAS PROMISED TO LET HIM RUN LINCOLN AS HE WANTS TO
c0kc020v I DON'T THINK AMERICAN CONTINENTAL WILL INSIST OR DIRECT ME TO DO THINGS WITH LINCOLN THAT I FEEL SHOULD NOT BE DONE MR. HINZ SAID
c0kc020w I THINK THE OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT OF LINCOLN REALIZED THEY HAVE TO BECOME MORE OF A TRADITIONAL THRIFT HE ADDED
c0kc020x INEVITABLY SOME WILL SEEK A FOURTH ALTERNATIVE TO CONTINUE BORROWING FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD MAKING ONLY MARGINAL ADJUSTMENTS IN OUR ECONOMIC POLICIES
c0kc020y EARLIER THIS CENTURY THE BRITISH TAUGHT US THAT DEBT AND LEADERSHIP CANNOT LONG CO EXIST
c0kc020z EVENTUALLY AND THE MARKETS SEEM TO BE SAYING SOONER RATHER THAN LATER WE WILL HAVE TO CHOOSE
c0kc0210 THE ARMY IS LIKELY TO CANCEL PLANS FOR ITS NEW FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS L. H. X. HELICOPTER PROGRAM BECAUSE OF BUDGET CUTS PENTAGON OFFICIALS SAID
c0kc0211 THE HELICOPTER WHICH WAS TO HAVE REPLACED VIETNAM ERA HUEY AND COBRA AIRCRAFT WAS CONSIDERED A CORNERSTONE OF THE ARMY'S MODERNIZATION
c0kc0212 A FINAL DECISION IS EXPECTED TODAY
c0kc0213 DEALERS SAID ACTIVITY WAS SLOW BECAUSE OF THE U. S. HOLIDAY CELEBRATING THE BIRTHDAY OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR
c0kc0214 <NOISE> MOST U. S. BANKS WERE CLOSED ALTHOUGH SEVERAL OF THE LARGER FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPARTMENTS REMAINED OPEN TO SERVICE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS AND TRADE WITH EUROPE
c0kc0215 BUT EVEN THEY WOUND DOWN THEIR TRADING WHEN THE LONDON MARKET SHUT DOWN AROUND NOON E. S. T. OR AFTER THE CHICAGO FUTURES MARKET CLOSED LATER IN THE AFTERNOON
c0kc0216 ADMIRAL CROWE ISN'T DEFENSIVE ABOUT MISTAKES
c0kc0217 IF THERE'S ONE PROFESSION IN WHICH YOU CAN'T MOUNT AN ERROR FREE OPERATION IT'S THE MILITARY HE SAYS
c0kc0218 IN THIS CASE THE J. C. S. CHIEF FEARED THAT CONGRESS MIGHT CURTAIL THE NAVY OPERATION IF THE U. S. REPEATEDLY LOOKED ILL PREPARED
c0kc0219 I HAD REALLY UNDERESTIMATED HOW INVOLVED CONGRESS WOULD GET AND HOW DETERMINED THEY WOULD BE TO POLITICIZE IT HE SAYS
c0kc021a TO PUNISH CURRENCY SPECULATORS THE GOVERNMENT IS ALLOWING PEOPLE TO EXCHANGE A MAXIMUM OF TEN MILLION OLD CORDOBAS
c0kc021b ANYTHING OVER THAT CAN'T BE EXCHANGED BUT MUST BE DEPOSITED IN A BANK ACCOUNT
c0kc021c THE MOVES TOOK EFFECT YESTERDAY
c0kc021d CRAY IS INTERESTED IN RIGHT NOW SELLING ITS STRIPPED DOWN HIGH SPEED BIG MEMORY RACING MACHINES
c0kc021e MR. ROLLWAGEN BELIEVES A MARKET THRESHOLD HAS BEEN CROSSED WITH SUDDENLY A WHOLE NEW FAMILY OF USERS FINDING THAT SUPERCOMPUTERS ARE COST EFFECTIVE

c0kc021g THE WINNER WILL BE THROWN IMMEDIATELY INTO HIS ROLE AS COMEX AMBASSADOR
c0kc021h <NOISE> THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTION HE WILL FLY TO BOCA RATON FLORIDA FOR THE FUTURES INDUSTRY'S ANNUAL CONVENTION
c0kc021i BOTH MEN HAVE RESERVATIONS
c0kc021j THE JANUARY INCREASE FOLLOWED A REVISED DECEMBER EXPANSION OF THREE POINT NINE EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AS FOUR POINT FOUR FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
c0kc021k AUTO LOANS OUTSTANDING INCREASED ONE POINT FIVE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN JANUARY AFTER AN INCREASE OF TWO POINT THREE TWO BILLION DOLLARS THE PREVIOUS MONTH
c0kc021l POINTING TO THE STRONG CAR SALES REPORTED FOR LATE FEBRUARY SEVERAL ECONOMISTS SUGGESTED THE MEASURE WILL AGAIN SHOW AN INCREASE IN THE REPORT RELEASED NEXT MONTH
c0kc021m SO WHAT IS THE OFFICIAL INTERPRETATION
c0kc021n THERE REALLY IS NO SCRIPT FOR OUR BENSON HEDGES ADS SAYS KENNETH OLSHAN CHAIRMAN OF WELLS RICH
c0kc021o WE JUST TOLD THE ACTORS TO DO WHAT THEY WOULD NATURALLY DO AT A BRUNCH
c0kc021p WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID CLICHES
c0kc021q ONE DAY THOSE WORDS HAUNT THIS LAND OF IMMENSE SUFFERING
c0kc021r ONE DAY SAY THE PEASANT FARMERS THE FOURTEEN YEAR BUSH WAR AGAINST ANTI GOVERNMENT REBELS WILL BE OVER
c0kc021s ONE DAY DROUGHT WILL DISAPPEAR FROM OUR LAND
c0kc021t ONE DAY THE ECONOMY WILL RECOVER
c0kc021u <NOISE> ONE DAY WE WILL BE ABLE TO FEED OURSELVES
c0kc021v BUT INVESTORS SOON HAD SECOND THOUGHTS AND DECIDED THAT THE STEELMAKER'S EXORBITANT OPENING PRICE SIGNALED SPECULATIVE EXCESS
c0kc021w SHARES OF POSCO AS POHANG IRON AND STEEL IS KNOWN FELL TO THE LOW THIRTY THOUSAND WON LEVEL

c0kc0221 HOW DID THE BOARD VOTE ON THE REDUCTION PLAN
c0kc0222 IT DIDN'T SAYS MR. MILLER
c0kc0223 A TWENTY TWO MEMBER EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE NOW SLASHED TO SEVEN BECAUSE OF RESIGNATIONS HANDLED THE VOTING
c0kc0224 THE PLAN PASSED UNANIMOUSLY
c0kc0225 U. S. OFFICIALS SAID SOVIET REFUSAL TO DESTROY A SIBERIA RADAR COMPLEX IS PROMPTING THE WHITE HOUSE TO CONSIDER EXPANDING STRATEGIC ARMS PROGRAMS
c0kc0226 THE U. S. CONTENDS THE RADAR VIOLATES THE A. B. M. PACT
c0kc0227 THE STEPS BEING WEIGHED INCLUDE REVERSING THE PLANNED DISMANTLING OF THREE NUCLEAR SUBMARINES AND ACCELERATING SPACE WEAPONS TESTING
c0kc0228 TOBACCO HEIRESS DORIS DUKE AGREED TO POST FIVE MILLION DOLLARS NEEDED BY IMELDA MARCOS TO SECURE BAIL ON RACKETEERING CHARGES

c0kc022a HIS ARRAIGNMENT HAS BEEN DELAYED
c0kc022b ON AUGUST TWENTY THIRD THE U. S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA UPHELD THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY'S APPROVAL OF THE PURCHASE OF THE INSURANCE COMPANY
c0kc022c THE COMPTROLLER HAD FOUND THAT MUNICIPAL BOND INSURANCE IS FUNCTIONALLY THE SAME AS BANKS' STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT

c0kc022e NEVERTHELESS THE TIGERS HAVE CAUGHT NEW STADIUM FEVER CITING A SHORTAGE OF PREMIUM SEATS AND A MAINTENANCE TAB THAT RUNS FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY

c0lc0202 THE AVERAGE FORECAST OF FOURTEEN ECONOMISTS SURVEYED BY DOW JONES CAPITAL MARKETS REPORT IS FOR A RISE OF ZERO POINT NINE PERCENT
c0lc0203 THAT WOULD BE THE THIRD CONSECUTIVE MONTHLY INCREASE AND WOULD FOLLOW A ZERO POINT SIX PERCENT GAIN IN OCTOBER
c0lc0207 RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
c0lc0208 THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT
c0lc0209 THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
c0lc020b THE REASON
c0lc020d IN EXCHANGE FOR GOOD BANKING SERVICE HE FEELS IT'S ONLY REASONABLE TO ALLOW THE BANK A DOLLOP OF LOW COST FUNDS
c0lc020e THE DISPUTE HAS BEEN SIMMERING SINCE JUNE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHEN EXCHANGE MEMBER WILLIAM J. HIGGINS BOUGHT A PORTABLE PHONE

c0lc020p NORWAY'S FEARS ARE SHORT TERM PEGGED TO THE RECENT STALL IN THE OIL PRICE RISE
c0lc020q IN SWEDEN THE REASON IS THE APPROACH OF AUTUMN WHEN A NEW ROUND OF UNION WAGE NEGOTIATIONS WILL TAKE THE ECONOMY INTO UNKNOWN TERRITORY AT LEAST TEMPORARILY
c0lc020r A NEW CONFERENCE BOARD SURVEY OF ONE THOUSAND SENIOR EXECUTIVES SHOWS CONFIDENCE UP SHARPLY

c0lc020y SALES OF COCAINE PASTE FROM WHICH COCAINE IS REFINED OUTSIDE PERU ARE ESTIMATED AT ONE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR
c0lc020z SEVERAL OWNERS OF CONTEMPORARY ART GALLERIES SAY THEY ARE NERVOUS ABOUT THE AFTERSHOCKS OF THE STOCK MARKET'S FALL BUT THEY STILL HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH DAMAGE
c0lc0210 I'M SURE THIS WILL HAVE SOME EFFECT ON MY BUSINESS SAYS DEALER JOHN WEBER IN NEW YORK
c0lc0211 I CAN ANTICIPATE THAT CORPORATE BUYING OF ART WILL BE AFFECTED DOWN THE PIKE
c0lc0212 BUT I'M NOT JUMPING OUT A WINDOW
c0lc0213 I'VE LIVED THROUGH RECESSIONS BEFORE AND I KNOW THAT TO REAL COLLECTORS ART IS AN OBSESSION
c0lc0215 ART COLLECTORS AND DEALERS HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF LAST NIGHT
c0lc0216 <NOISE> AFTER HIGH PRICES AND FRANTIC BIDDING AT ART AUCTIONS LAST SPRING ABOUT ONE IN FOUR WORKS DIDN'T SELL AT A CONTEMPORARY ART AUCTION AT CHRISTIE'S
c0lc0217 BUT AT LEAST THE MARKET DIDN'T CRASH
c0lc0218 THE AUCTION HOUSE SAID THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE TOP TEN ART WORKS ALL SOLD FOR MORE THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS EACH
c0lc0219 RECORDS WERE SET FOR SIX ARTISTS INCLUDING MARC CHAGALL CLAUDE MONET AND PIERRE AUGUSTE RENOIR
c0lc021a THE TOP PRICE WAS FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A RENOIR PAINTING OF A YOUNG WOMAN
c0lc021b ATTORNEYS FOR THE SECURITIES FIRM HAD REQUESTED THAT THE APPELLATE COURT VOID JUDGE IRVING'S JUDGMENT BUT THE APPELLATE COURT DENIED THAT REQUEST YESTERDAY
c0lc021c A CLERK FOR JUDGE IRVING SAID DONALDSON LUFKIN WILL LIKELY APPEAL THE RULING DIRECTLY TO JUDGE IRVING
c0lc021d A SPOKESWOMAN FOR DONALDSON LUFKIN DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE MATTER
c0lc021e THOSE LANDS HAVE BECOME WORTH MUCH MORE THAN THE TRANSPORTATION AND ENERGY CONCERN NEEDS FOR THE RAILROAD AND THE COMPANY HAD BEEN TRYING TO FREE ITSELF FROM THE LIENS
c0lc021f LAST SPRING BURLINGTON AGREED TO PAY REMAINING BONDHOLDERS A TOTAL OF THIRTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN RETURN FOR PERMISSION TO REMOVE THE COVENANTS
c0lc021g A JUDGE APPROVED THE AGREEMENT IN NOVEMBER AND IT BECAME FINAL JANUARY TWELFTH
c0lc021h TWELVE PHILADELPHIA ANTIQUE DEALERS WERE CHARGED BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WITH ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS
c0lc021i ELEVEN PLEADED GUILTY LAST FALL AND WERE FINED BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND GIVEN PROBATIONARY SENTENCES UP TO THREE YEARS
c0lc021j <NOISE> THE TWELFTH WAS FOUND GUILTY BY A JURY SENTENCED TO THIRTY DAYS OF HOUSE ARREST AND FINED THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
c0lc021k TWO FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD GOVERNORS WAYNE ANGELL AND MARTHA SEGER SAID THEY ARE ENCOURAGED BY THE DOLLAR'S RECENT STABILITY IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS
c0lc021l MR. ANGELL ALSO EXPRESSED OPTIMISM ABOUT THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK THIS YEAR
c0lc021n REGARDLESS OF HOW THE FOREIGN PURCHASES BEGIN THEY OFTEN INVOLVE THE VERY PARTS THAT MAKE WEAPONS PERFORM
c0lc021o FOR EXAMPLE F. M. C. CORPORATION'S BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLE DEPENDS ON A SOPHISTICATED SENSOR SYSTEM FROM THE NETHERLANDS TO INFORM SOLDIERS OF POTENTIAL THREATS AND TARGETS
c0lc021p WITHOUT THIS PART TUCKED INTO THE TURRET OF THE ARMORED VEHICLE THE BRADLEY WOULD BE COMPARATIVELY HELPLESS ON THE BATTLEFIELD
c0lc021r IN THE PAST THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CRITICIZED FOR BEING TOO BUREAUCRATIC AND SLOW MOVING
c0lc021s THE NEW MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE WILL SHORTEN THE APPROVAL CYCLE AND COMMUNICATION CYCLE WITH THE COMPANY MR. MCDONNELL SAID
c0lc021t IN AN AWKWARD REMINDER OF THE BOOM DAYS SHEARSON'S NEW LONDON HEADQUARTERS FACES AN ICE SKATING RINK BUILT JUST TO GIVE THE COMPLEX MORE GRANDEUR
c0lc021v <NOISE> IT LOOKS NICE DOESN'T IT A SHEARSON OFFICIAL BITTERLY REMARKS
c0lc021x PHILLIPS REVERSED A YEAR EARLIER LOSS BY POSTING NET OF ONE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS OR FIFTY FIVE CENTS A SHARE
c0lc021y IT HAD A SMALL ONE TIME GAIN IN THE QUARTER
c0lc0221 THE REPORT ON PRODUCER PRICES FOR MAY IS WIDELY EXPECTED TO SHOW AN INCREASE OF ZERO POINT FOUR PERCENT
c0lc0222 IF IT COMES IN ZERO POINT FIVE PERCENT OR HIGHER THAT'S GOING TO BE BAD FOR BONDS MR. BOZIAN WARNED
c0lc0223 THE INITIAL UGLINESS WILL BE OVERWHELMED BY THE FORCE OF NEW IDEAS AND A SYNTHESIS OF OLD ONES
c0lc0224 HUNDREDS OF YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WILL EVALUATE WHAT THEY SEE THERE
c0lc0225 THEY WILL BEGIN TO QUESTION AND TO READ AND TO THINK
c0lc0226 YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IT WILL HAPPEN THOUGH IN THE CASE OF MR. DOWNEY'S SHOW IT REQUIRES PHILOSOPHICAL TENACITY
c0lc0227 GIVEN THE PRICE OF THE STOCK IT'S A GOOD USE OF CASH SAID WILLIAM R. YOUNG AN ANALYST WITH THE DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED
c0lc0228 THEY'RE DEFINITELY UNDERVALUED
c0lc0229 FOR A PREMIER CHEMICAL COMPANY TO CARRY SUCH A DISCOUNT NEAR THE END OF AN ECONOMIC CYCLE SEEMS SILLY TO ME
c0lc022a <NOISE> ACQUIRED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE FRIENDLY REPORTED MODEST GROWTH UNTIL LAST YEAR WHEN LABOR SHORTAGES AND LOWER CUSTOMER TRAFFIC HURT THE CHAIN
c0lc022b THE UNIT IMPROVED SALES WITH HIGHER PRICES NEW STORE OPENINGS AND THE ACQUISITION OF TWO SMALL RESTAURANT CHAINS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
c0lc022c HOWEVER FRIENDLY'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PRETAX OPERATING PROFIT OF FORTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS WAS BELOW THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S FIFTY POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS
c0lc022d THE COMPANY SAID THE RESULTS INDICATE ITS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE SALES ARE BEGINNING TO PAY OFF
c0lc022e LAST YEAR THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS TRAINING TO IMPROVE SERVICE
c0lc022f IN FEBRUARY IT LAUNCHED RADIO ADVERTISEMENTS FEATURING COMEDIAN MARTIN MULL AND IN APRIL IT UNVEILED A NEW MENU
c0lc022g BEFORE THE VENTURE CAPITALIST HAD FINISHED EXPLAINING HIS INVESTMENT CRITERIA AND EXPECTED RETURN THE WOULD BE ENTREPRENEUR WAS PACKING HER PAPERS
c0lc022h YOU VENTURE CAPITALISTS ARE ALL ALIKE
c0lc022i YOU'RE TOO DAMN GREEDY SHE COMPLAINED
c0lc022j A MINUTE LATER SHE WAS GONE
c0mc0201 THE IRANIAN CRISIS AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S UNCERTAIN GRIP ON IT HAS REAWAKENED THIS CYNICISM
c0mc0207 HE ARRANGES MATCHES FOR THE BOXERS HE DEVELOPS AND THUS GETS A CUT OF THE PURSE
c0mc020a MR. STEWARD RESIDES IN AN AFFLUENT SECTION OF WEST DETROIT WHERE HE OWNS SEVERAL HOMES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD USING SOME OF THEM TO HOUSE THE FURNITURE HE COLLECTS
c0mc020b <NOISE> BANKS WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES EXCLUDED FROM THE PRIVATE TALKS
c0mc020c STEPHEN D. SUSMAN ONE OF THE HUNTS' LEAD ATTORNEYS SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE DISCUSSIONS UNTIL HE STARTED HEARING THE OTHER BANKS' OBJECTIONS
c0mc020d BUT MR. SUSMAN SAID HE ISN'T TROUBLED BY THE MEETINGS <NOISE>
c0mc020e IT SEEMS LIKE GOOD SENSE TO ME <NOISE>
c0mc020i THE COMMERCIAL PLUGGED AN ANTACID FOR HUMANS
c0mc020m INSTEAD HE SAYS THEY'RE EATING ONLY FOR SENSATION
c0mc020o THE ANSWER IS TO SOME EXTENT DEPENDENT ON HOW DESIRABLE ONE FINDS THE TRADITIONAL FAMILY ARRANGEMENT
c0mc020r <NOISE> <NOISE> <NOISE> THOSE WHO DISAPPROVE OF THE TRADITIONAL FAMILY UNIT MAY FIND THE EMERGING PATTERN OF ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS A WELCOMING CHANGE
c0mc020t IN THE LATEST QUARTER WESTINGHOUSE HAD ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR POINT NINE MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING DOWN FROM ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION A YEAR EARLIER
c0mc020u IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS AN EXCELLENT QUARTER SAID GAIL LANDIS OF SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN AND COMPANY
c0mc020v SHE NOTED THE STRONG IMPROVEMENTS IN THE COMPANY'S OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN DURING THE QUARTER TO EIGHT POINT EIGHT PERCENT FROM SEVEN POINT FOUR PERCENT LAST YEAR
c0mc020w ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THE QUARTER'S SALES WERE FLAT WHEN CONSIDERING THE ABSENCE OF THE CABLE OPERATIONS
c0mc020y BUT IN RESPONSE TO AN ANALYST'S QUESTION HE SAID EARNINGS OF TWO DOLLARS A SHARE SOUNDS STRONG
c0mc020z <NOISE> HE ALSO WARNED ANALYSTS AGAINST LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR QUARTER AND ISOLATING IT ADDING WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE ANNUAL TREND LINE
c0mc0210 WHILE THE U. S. FOCUSES ON THE IRAN CONTRA HEARINGS MORE SOVIET ARMS FLOW INTO NICARAGUA
c0mc0213 THE SOVIET EQUIPMENT IS JUST POURING IN ONE RANKING PENTAGON OFFICIAL TOLD THE A. P.
c0mc0214 THE NICARAGUANS ARE CONSOLIDATING THEIR MILITARY BUILDUP AND ADDING TO IT EVERYTHING IMAGINABLE
c0mc0215 DETAILS OF THE NEW OFFER WEREN'T DISCLOSED
c0mc0216 THE RAILWAYS HAVE BEEN SEEKING A WAGE FREEZE LOWER WAGES FOR STARTING EMPLOYEES AND OTHER CONCESSIONS REJECTED BY THE UNIONS
c0mc0217 THE PREVIOUS CONTRACT EXPIRED DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST
c0mc0218 THE UNIONS HAVE BEEN SEEKING A FIVE PERCENT WAGE RAISE IN EACH OF TWO YEARS MORE JOB SECURITY AND GUARANTEES AGAINST SUBCONTRACTING
c0mc021d MANY AGREE THERE IS LITTLE TIME TO WASTE IN THE SCRAMBLE TO CREATE BETTER INTERNATIONAL REGULATION
c0mc021f D. D. C. CAUSES A PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY TINGLING NUMBING AND PAIN PRINCIPALLY IN THE FEET THAT CAN REQUIRE POTENT PAINKILLERS SUCH AS MORPHINE
c0mc021g IT ISN'T KNOWN WHETHER SUCH SIDE EFFECTS CAN BE REVERSED DOCTOR SOO SAID
c0mc021k WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS AN ATTEMPT TO GET MORE FLEXIBILITY FROM UNIONS TO ALLOW COST REDUCTIONS
c0mc021l THE PROPOSED MERGER OF COMEX AND THE RIVAL NEW YORK MERCANTILE EXCHANGE IS A BIG ISSUE HOWEVER
c0mc021n WE CAN'T CONTINUE AS A METALS EXCHANGE
c0mc021o WE MUST EXPAND THROUGH MERGER MR. HANEMANN SAYS <NOISE>
c0mc021p MR. GARVEY DOESN'T STRESS A NYMEX MERGER NEARLY AS MUCH AS HIS OPPONENT BUT HE SAYS HE'S ONE HUNDRED PERCENT IN FAVOR OF MERGER
c0mc021q JAMES L. WINOKUR OF PITTSBURGH IS AN ART EXPERT AND TRUSTEE OF CARNEGIE INSTITUTE
c0mc021r <NOISE> IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND AGAIN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HE DONATED TEN PERCENT INTERESTS IN FORTY FOUR ART WORKS TO CARNEGIE'S MUSEUM
c0mc021s EACH GIFT ENTITLED IT TO POSSESSION FOR A PROPORTIONAL PART OF THE YEAR BUT THE MUSEUM DIDN'T EXERCISE ITS RIGHT
c0mc021t IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE WINOKUR DONATED HIS REMAINING EIGHTY PERCENT INTEREST IN FIVE WORKS THE MUSEUM THEN TOOK THOSE FIVE
c0mc021v THE KING'S REQUEST LEFT THE DELEGATES IN A TIGHT SPOT
c0mc021w TO IGNORE JORDAN AND MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL FORMAL CASH PLEDGE TO THE P. L. O. WOULD SIGNAL A SHIFT AWAY FROM MODERATION DIFFICULT FOR THE GULF STATES TO COUNTENANCE
c0mc021x <NOISE> BUT TO FINANCE BOTH JORDAN AND THE P. L. O. RISKED TRIGGERING A CLAMOR FROM OTHER CASH STRAPPED STATES COVERED FROM THE BAGHDAD AGREEMENT SUCH AS LEBANON AND SYRIA
c0mc021y THE APPARENT INCONSISTENCY IS JUSTIFIED MAINTAINED ROBERT BURGER CHEVROLET GENERAL MANAGER GIVEN THE GROWING DIFFICULTY IN LAUNCHING MODELS IN AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE FIELD
c0mc0220 <NOISE> CHEVROLET IS USING THE SAME APPROACH WITH ITS GEO LINE OF IMPORT CARS THAT DEBUTS THIS FALL
c0mc0222 IT USUALLY CONSISTS OF THREE YEAR NOTES TEN YEAR NOTES AND THIRTY YEAR BONDS <NOISE>
c0mc0223 BUT THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY CLOSE TO REACHING ITS LIMITS ON ISSUING LONG TERM DEBT AND THUS ASKED CONGRESS TO INCREASE ITS AUTHORITY
c0mc0224 CONGRESS STILL HASN'T COMPLETED WORK ON THE ISSUE WHICH IS PART OF THE TAX BILL PASSED LATE TUESDAY BY THE SENATE
c0mc0225 <NOISE> KEVIN O'CONNELL SALES MANAGER AT TOYOTA OF ORANGE SAID OCTOBER WAS SLOWER THAN USUAL AT THE BIG SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DEALERSHIP <NOISE>
c0mc0227 THERE'S PROBABLY A FEW PEOPLE WHO COME IN MORE SO THAN IN THE PAST AND SUFFER FROM STICKER SHOCK HE SAID
c0mc0229 BUT BOTH HAVE BEEN HEAVILY DISCOUNTED BY AS MUCH AS NINE DOLLARS A CASSETTE AND BOTH HAVE REBATE OFFERS <NOISE>
c0mc022g WE ARE JUST SELECTING A RANGE OF MANUFACTURERS WHO ARE MAKING THESE GENERIC PRODUCTS
c0mc022i AS A RESULT HE SAID IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THE FED IS GOING TO EASE AT THIS TIME
c0nc0201 LAST WEEK THERE WERE REPORTS THAT AFTER THE OFFERING SHEARSON LEHMAN HAD A BIG UNSOLD CHUNK OF STOCK
c0nc0202 IN A NARROWLY DRAWN STATEMENT VICE CHAIRMAN HERBERT FREIMAN DENIED SHEARSON HAD OFFERED A BLOCK TO SALOMON BROTHERS WHICH MANAGED THE SELLING BROKERS' FLOOR OPERATION
c0nc0203 MR. FREIMAN WOULDN'T ELABORATE
c0nc0204 THE COMPANY SELLS COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRIMARILY TO LEGAL OFFICES
c0nc0205 COMPUTRAC WILL PAY OUT THREE CENTS IN JULY AND NINE CENTS IN THE FOLLOWING JANUARY
c0nc0206 THE FIRST DIVIDEND IS PAYABLE IN JULY TO STOCK OF RECORD JULY FIFTH
c0nc0207 COMPUTRAC WILL PAY NINE CENTS IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT TO STOCK OF RECORD JANUARY FIFTH NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
c0nc0208 BELLSOUTH CORPORATION AN ATLANTA BASED REGIONAL TELEPHONE COMPANY IS LETTING N. I. O. S. H. STUDY THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OF ITS FEMALE WORKERS
c0nc0209 BUT THE COMPANY WON'T LET RESEARCHERS ASK WORKERS ABOUT THEIR FERTILITY HISTORY OR THEIR PERCEPTION OF OCCUPATIONAL STRESS A POTENTIAL CAUSE OF MISCARRIAGES
c0nc020a A BELLSOUTH SPOKESMAN SAYS THE COMPANY BELIEVES SUCH QUESTIONS ARE OUTSIDE THE STUDY'S SCOPE
c0nc020b HE TELLS US TO CLOSE OUR EYES AND IMAGINE THE BEACH
c0nc020c FEEL THE SUNSHINE
c0nc020d SMELL THE SEA AIR
c0nc020e HEAR THE WAVES CRASHING AGAINST THE SHORE
c0nc020f NOW FEEL YOURSELF PLAYING WITH THE DOLPHINS AND INVITE THEM BACK TO PLAY WITH YOU HERE MR. ROWE SAYS
c0nc020g HE HAS SAID SOME OF US WILL BECOME DOLPHINS
c0nc020h DESPITE MY BEST EFFORTS I REMAIN A REPORTER SEATED ON A CHAIR IN A BOOKSTORE
c0nc020i JOHN SLOAN'S PEOPLE ARE LARGELY TAKEN FOR GRANTED BUT AS IT HAPPENS THEY HAVE BEEN THE STARS OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES
c0nc020j AS BIG CORPORATIONS HAVE LAID OFF WORKERS BY THE THOUSANDS TO MEET COMPETITIVE PRESSURES SMALL FIRMS HAVE MORE THAN CUSHIONED THE BLOW
c0nc020k THEY HAVE CREATED SOME TEN MILLION NEW JOBS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ACCORDING TO AN ESTIMATE MADE AT LAST YEAR'S WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON SMALL BUSINESS
c0nc020l MOREOVER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IS THE RULE MAINLY BECAUSE SMALL ENTREPRENEURS MAKE THEIR OWN OPPORTUNITIES
c0nc020m BY ONE ESTIMATE WOMEN NOW ACCOUNT FOR HALF OF NEW BUSINESS START UPS IN THE U. S.
c0nc020n THE COMPANY SAID JOY TECHNOLOGIES' PROJECTED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WON'T BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS DUE BEFORE JUNE TWENTIETH NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
c0nc020o AS A RESULT JOY TECHNOLOGIES WILL HAVE TO SELL A NUMBER OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS
c0nc020p THE COMPANY PROJECTED SALES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT OF FIVE HUNDRED TEN MILLION DOLLARS AND IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE OF FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS
c0nc020q LAST MONTH'S SURGE WAS WIDESPREAD WITH AUTO SALES RISING ONE POINT NINE PERCENT BUILDING MATERIALS ONE POINT TWO PERCENT AND FURNITURE CLIMBING ZERO POINT SEVEN PERCENT
c0nc020r THE ONLY NOTICEABLE DECLINES WERE IN RESTAURANTS ZERO POINT SIX PERCENT AND FOOD STORES ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT
c0nc020s EXCLUDING AUTOS SALES ROSE ZERO POINT FOUR PERCENT LAST MONTH
c0nc020t U. S. UTILITIES COULD ALSO INCREASE ORDERS OF FOREIGN URANIUM AHEAD OF ANY TOTAL IMPORT RESTRICTIONS ANALYSTS SAY
c0nc020u URANIUM FROM SOUTH AFRICA FOR EXAMPLE HAS ALREADY FALLEN UNDER ANTI APARTHEID SANCTIONS
c0nc020v BUT LAST YEAR SAID THE URANIUM INSTITUTE U. S. IMPORTS OF SOUTH AFRICAN URANIUM SURGED THREE HUNDRED PERCENT TO MORE THAN THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION POUNDS
c0nc020w ALMOST SIXTY PERCENT OF THE DELIVERIES TOOK PLACE IN DECEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE LAST MONTH BEFORE THE EMBARGO TOOK EFFECT
c0nc020y A SPOKESMAN FOR THE COMPANY SAID SUN IS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING LARGE IN THE AREA OF ENERGY RESERVES
c0nc020z THE SPOKESMAN SAID SUN HAS MORE THAN ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN CAPITAL THAT IT HAS GAINED FROM SPINOFFS AND DIVESTITURES OF COMPANIES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS
c0nc0210 ONE REASON THE RATIOS FELL SO SHARPLY IN THE MONTH HE EXPLAINS IS THAT VOLUME DURING OCTOBER SOARED
c0nc0211 THAT RAISED THE AVERAGE DAY'S TRADING VOLUME
c0nc0212 IN THE COMING MONTH HE PREDICTS SHORT INTEREST RATIOS WILL RISE SINCE AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME HAS SINCE FALLEN
c0nc0213 NO FINAL BUDGET DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE AT THE WHITE HOUSE
c0nc0214 BUDGET DRAFTING IS BEHIND SCHEDULE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES WON'T EVEN SEE O. M. B. RECOMMENDATIONS UNTIL LATE THIS WEEK
c0nc0215 BUT IT'S ALREADY CLEAR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INCREASED ITS EMPHASIS ON EDUCATION
c0nc0216 THE EXPECTED FOURTH QUARTER RESULT WOULD GIVE THE COMPANY PROFIT OF TEN TO TWELVE CENTS A SHARE FOR ALL OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
c0nc0217 IT POSTED PROFIT OF TWENTY SEVEN CENTS A SHARE FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX INCLUDING ABOUT FOURTEEN CENTS A SHARE FROM AN ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT
c0nc0218 THE COMPANY DIDN'T MAKE ESTIMATES FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN NET INCOME
c0nc0219 ADVANCING ISSUES AND DECLINERS WERE NECK AND NECK YESTERDAY BUT THE HEAVIEST TRADING WAS AMONG THE ISSUES WITH RISING PRICES
c0nc021a SOME FIFTY POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS AT ADVANCING PRICES COMPARED WITH THIRTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION THAT TRADED AT LOWER PRICES
c0nc021b IN ALL A MODERATE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION SHARES TRADED ON NASDAQ YESTERDAY
c0nc021c ON FRIDAY SHEARSON LEHMAN BROTHERS INCORPORATED SAID IT IS CEASING PROGRAM TRADING FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT
c0nc021d WE DON'T WANT TO BE PART OF THE PROBLEM SAID JEFFREY LANE PRESIDENT OF SHEARSON
c0nc021e MR. LANE SAID HE WOULD RATHER SEE WALL STREET MODIFY ITS BEHAVIOR THAN HAVE WASHINGTON REGULATORS CLAMP DOWN
c0nc021g MOBIL BASED IN NEW YORK SAID ITS FOURTH QUARTER NET INCOME JUMPED NINETY TWO PERCENT
c0nc021h THE LATEST QUARTER INCLUDED A ONE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLAR WRITE DOWN OF FOREIGN INVENTORIES
c0nc021i REVENUE ROSE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TO FIFTEEN POINT SIX SIX BILLION DOLLARS FROM TWELVE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
c0nc021j CAMPEAU BOOSTED ITS HOSTILE OFFER FOR FEDERATED DEPARTMENT STORES TO FIVE POINT FOUR SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS AMID SIGNS OF A POSSIBLE BIDDING WAR FOR THE RETAILER
c0nc021k AT LEAST TWO MAJOR GROUPS ARE WEIGHING BIDS SOURCES SAID INCLUDING A GROUP LED BY KOHLBERG KRAVIS
c0nc021l OTHER POTENTIAL SUITORS ARE SAID TO BE DILLARD DEPARTMENT STORES AND DEVELOPERS ALFRED TAUBMAN AND MELVIN SIMON
c0nc021m SCIENTIFIC STUDIES HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE DEVICE CAUSED INFECTIONS THAT LED TO SEVERE COMPLICATIONS
c0nc021n ROBINS STILL CONTENDS OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INJURIES
c0nc021p DIRECTORS BOOSTED THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND SEVENTEEN PERCENT TO THIRTY FIVE CENTS A SHARE FROM THIRTY CENTS PAYABLE APRIL FIRST TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD MARCH EIGHTEENTH
c0nc021q THE TWO FOR ONE STOCK SPLIT IS PAYABLE MAY SECOND TO RECORD APRIL EIGHTH
c0nc021r THE COMPANY SAID IT INTENDS TO PAY SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE CENTS QUARTERLY EFFECTIVE WITH THE JULY FIRST PAYMENT
c0nc021s THAT GROWTH CAME IN RESPONSE TO A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES DURING THE SECOND HALF WHICH PROMPTED A FLOOD OF MORTGAGE APPLICATIONS
c0nc021t IT ALSO REFLECTED GOVERNMENT MEASURES TO STIMULATE DOMESTIC SPENDING
c0nc021u THE HOUSING BOOM IN TURN TRIGGERED HEAVY CONSUMER SPENDING ON HOUSEHOLD GOODS WHICH AIDED THE STRONG SECOND HALF ECONOMIC EXPANSION
c0nc021v INFLATION ADJUSTED GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT GREW TWO PERCENT IN THE THIRD QUARTER FROM THE PRIOR THREE MONTHS AND ONE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER
c0nc021w TURKEY WAS ON THE MOVE
c0nc021x IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR FEWER THAN HALF OF TURKEY'S VILLAGES HAD ELECTRICITY OR PHONES BY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN ONLY A FEW WERE WITHOUT
c0nc021y A HUGE CAMPAIGN BEGAN TO BUILD HIGHWAYS ROADS AND MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE DAMS
c0nc021z AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED WARNER AND LORIMAR AGREED IN MAY TO MERGE IN A STOCK SWAP VALUED AT ABOUT SIX HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS
c0nc0220 CHRIS CRAFT INDUSTRIES INCORPORATED WARNER'S LARGEST SHAREHOLDER HAS FILED SUIT TO DELAY THE MERGER CHARGING THAT IT VIOLATES CHRIS CRAFT'S SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT WITH WARNER
c0nc0221 NEVERTHELESS WARNER HAS SAID IT PLANS TO PROCEED WITH THE MERGER ANYWAY
c0nc0222 OTHER E. C. STATES ALSO HAVE RESERVATIONS THOUGH THEY DON'T FEEL AS STRONGLY ABOUT THEM AS DOES BRITAIN
c0nc0223 DENMARK FOR EXAMPLE WORRIES THAT IT MIGHT HAVE TO TIGHTEN CONTROLS ON ITS NON E. C. NORDIC NEIGHBORS
c0nc0224 IRELAND WANTS TO ENSURE THAT FREER BORDERS GO HAND IN HAND WITH CLOSER SECURITY COOPERATION AMONG E. C. NATIONS
c0nc0225 DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY THE ARMY PLAYS AN INCALCULABLE ROLE IN KEEPING PAKISTAN'S DISTORTED ECONOMY PERKING
c0nc0226 MR. JONES THE AUTHOR NOTES THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PAKISTANI HOUSEHOLDS FOUR PERCENT OF THE ECONOMICALLY ACTIVE ONES HAVE SENT YOUNG MEN INTO THE ARMY
c0nc0227 ADD IN THE HOUSEHOLDS INVOLVED IN SERVICES FOR THE MILITARY AND NEARLY TEN PERCENT OF THE NATION'S HOUSEHOLDS ARE INVOLVED
c0nc0228 NOT TO WORRY IT ADDS BECAUSE MAJOR CARRIERS BY CONTROLLING ROUTES AND MAJOR HUBS AREN'T AS VULNERABLE AS PREVIOUSLY TO COMPETITION
c0nc0229 THEY ALSO HAVE HIDDEN SALABLE ASSETS SUCH AS AIRPORT GATES LANDING SLOTS ROUTES AND PLANES
c0nc022a THEY MANAGE FARE STRUCTURES MORE EFFICIENTLY
c0nc022b AND THEY BENEFIT FROM HIGH OPERATING LEVERAGE
c0nc022c FOR EXAMPLE SALOMON SAYS A HALF PENNY INCREASE IN YIELD PER REVENUE PASSENGER MILE WOULD BOOST UNITED'S OPERATING INCOME BY THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS
c0nc022d BUT RUTH HANDLER HADN'T LOST HER CREATIVE TOUCH
c0nc022e AFTER UNDERGOING A MASTECTOMY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SHE FOUND THAT NO ONE WAS PRODUCING SUITABLE PROSTHESES
c0nc022f SO SHE DESIGNED HER OWN CALLED NEARLY ME AND THUS BEGAN ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS
c0oc0201 MR. KATO TAKES ADVANTAGE OF HIS COMPANY'S SHARE PURCHASE PLAN
c0oc0202 MITSUBISHI SUBSIDIZES ITS EMPLOYEES WHO BUY THE COMPANY'S SHARES BY PAYING TEN PERCENT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE
c0oc0203 HE FIGURES THAT HE GETS A MUCH BETTER RETURN THAT WAY THAN BY PUTTING MONEY IN THE BANK
c0oc0204 A TILT TOWARD TURKEY MAY VERY WELL BE WARRANTED BUT THE U. S. AND CONSERVATIVES IN PARTICULAR SHOULD NOT BE TEMPTED TO VENTURE TOO FAR
c0oc0205 MR. PAPANDREOU IS DEEP IN ECONOMIC MUSH AND AN EXCESSIVE SHOW OF SUPPORT NOW FOR TURKEY WOULD ONLY PROVIDE HIM WITH A FRESH OPPORTUNITY TO RALLY HIS FORCES
c0oc0206 THE SOCIALIST STORM APPEARS TO BE RECEDING IN ATHENS AND PRESIDENT REAGAN SHOULD CONTINUE TO RIDE IT OUT
c0oc0207 RAYTHEON DENIED THAT IT'S FREELY GIVING AWAY JOBS
c0oc0208 WE AREN'T CRAZY ABOUT OFFSETS BUT WE'D ENTER INTO THEM AS A COMPROMISE BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT IF IT'S THE BEST THAT'S AVAILABLE SAID RAYTHEON SPOKESMAN LAWRENCE MCCRACKEN
c0oc0209 HE ADDED THAT THERE WERE ALSO SOME POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS BEHIND THE DECISION TO SHARE THE PATRIOT BUSINESS WITH THE THREE U. S. ALLIES
c0oc020a SEPARATELY HEALTHCARE SAID IT INTENDS TO BUY BACK AS MUCH AS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF ITS CLASS A COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME ON THE OPEN MARKET
c0oc020b HEALTHCARE CURRENTLY HAS FOUR MILLION FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY CLASS A SHARES OUTSTANDING
c0oc020c IN COMPOSITE TRADING ON THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE YESTERDAY HEALTHCARE CLOSED AT NINE DOLLARS A SHARE DOWN TWELVE POINT FIVE CENTS
c0oc020d THEY HAVE PUT IN A LOT OF MONEY BUT IS THAT ENOUGH
c0oc020e NOBODY KNOWS SAID MR. BRAY
c0oc020f IN OCTOBER WE THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH BUT BETWEEN OCTOBER AND NOW IT'S PROVEN TO BE NOT ENOUGH
c0oc020g WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH IT WILL BE
c0oc020h MR. CAYNE DECLINED TO SAY WHICH FUNDS HIS FIRM SELLS OR HOW MUCH BUSINESS THEY REPRESENT
c0oc020i BUT CRITERION GROUP A HOUSTON BASED LOAD FUND GROUP ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS A MAJOR SUPPLIER TO BEAR STEARNS
c0oc020j BROKERAGE FIRMS GENERALLY SELL LOAD FUNDS BOTH THEIR OWN AND OTHERS WHICH CARRY A SALES CHARGE THAT PAYS THE BROKER'S COMMISSION
c0oc020k J. W. T. HADN'T YET RESPONDED TO W. P. P.'S WEDNESDAY BID OF FORTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE OR ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS
c0oc020l ON FRIDAY W. P. P. LAUNCHED A HOSTILE FORTY FIVE DOLLAR A SHARE TENDER OFFER FOR J. W. T.'S APPROXIMATELY TEN MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
c0oc020m THAT HOSTILE OFFER FORMALLY REMAINED IN EFFECT DESPITE W. P. P.'S LATEST MOVE
c0oc020n MANGA FITS NICELY INTO A LIFE STYLE THAT PROVIDES LITTLE TIME OR OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY LIVE ONE'S FANTASIES
c0oc020o FOR EXAMPLE STUDENTS WHOSE DAYS ACTUALLY ARE SPENT STUDYING BECOME COMIC BOOK SECRET AGENTS AND SOLDIERS
c0oc020p AND A FREQUENT MANGA THEME IS A BOY'S LOVE AFFAIR WITH HIS BUXOM TEACHER
c0oc020q BUT FIRST CITY WOUND UP MAKING LOANS TO SOME OF THE MOST TROUBLED ENERGY CONCERNS IN TEXAS
c0oc020r IT CONCENTRATED MORE THAN A THIRD OF ITS ENERGY LENDING IN THE ROLLERCOASTER FORTUNES OF SERVICE AND DRILLING COMPANIES
c0oc020s WHEN THE ENERGY INDUSTRY WAS GROWING THE LOANS WERE HIGHLY PROFITABLE OFTEN YIELDING TWO OR THREE POINTS OVER THE PRIME RATE
c0oc020t BUT WHEN OIL PRICES FELL IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO AND EXPLORATION SLOWED THESE COMPANIES SOME OF THEM YOUNG AND HIGHLY LEVERAGED QUICKLY RAN INTO PROBLEMS
c0oc020u ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THEY HADN'T EXPECTED LOWER OPERATING PROFITS FOR THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRIES GROUP AND FOR THE BROADCASTING SEGMENT
c0oc020v WESTINGHOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD ANALYSTS THAT OPERATING PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIES GROUP FELL FIFTEEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT HURT IN PART BY WEAK RESULTS IN CANADIAN OPERATIONS
c0oc020w A SHARP DROP IN OPERATING PROFIT FROM THE BROADCASTING GROUP'S PRODUCTION COMPANY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS OVERALL FOR THAT SEGMENT
c0oc020x IN DECEMBER AUTO LOANS INCREASED BY TWO POINT FIVE TWO BILLION DOLLARS OR AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF ELEVEN POINT SEVEN PERCENT
c0oc020y CREDIT CARD BORROWING SOARED BY TWO POINT THREE TWO BILLION DOLLARS OR AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF NINETEEN POINT FOUR PERCENT
c0oc020z A FED ECONOMIST SUGGESTED THIS LARGE INCREASE MAY REFLECT SLOWER GROWTH EARLIER IN THE YEAR AS CONSUMERS USED HOME EQUITY LOANS TO PAY OFF CREDIT CARD BALANCES
c0oc0210 ALL THE INCREASES ARE SEASONALLY ADJUSTED
c0oc0211 BUT HE IS BULLISH ON THE ECONOMY
c0oc0212 REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE SEE IN THE MARKET THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE SEEMS MUCH STRONGER THAN THE MARKET HE SAID
c0oc0213 WHEN I LEAVE THE OFFICE AND GET HOME I'M NOT AS CONCERNED WHEN I TALK TO THE NEIGHBORS
c0oc0214 WHILE CHRONICLING THE DOINGS OF THE HIGHFALUTIN MAY SEEM LIGHT STUFF TO SOME MR. REVSON SAYS HIS OWN APPROACH TO THE SUBJECT MATTER ISN'T
