c0zc021v ONE BAG EQUALS SIXTY KILOS
c0zc021w THE ANNUAL GLOBAL EXPORT QUOTA IS FIFTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION BAGS
c0zc021x MR. AGEE SAID THE LOSSES WERE A DISAPPOINTMENT AND A SURPRISE TO THE BOARD TOO
c0zc021y THAT SUGGESTS THAT MR. AGEE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN TO SHAKE THINGS UP
c0zc021z IN A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW FRIDAY MR. AGEE DIDN'T RULE ANYTHING OUT
c0zc0220 STEPHEN A. DUZAN CHAIRMAN PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER SAID IT'S OBVIOUSLY QUITE A CHANGE FROM A YEAR AGO
c0zc0221 IT'S OUR THIRD YEAR OF CASH FLOW AND WE'VE BEEN PROFITABLE FOR THREE OUT OF THE LAST FOUR QUARTERS
c0zc0222 SO WE THINK IN GENERAL THAT THIS REPRESENTS A REAL HEALTHY KIND OF PICTURE FOR COMPANIES WHO PRODUCTS AREN'T YET APPROVED
c0zc0223 THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS FOUR OF ITS EXPERIMENTAL PRODUCTS IN HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS FOR DISEASES SUCH AS CANCER AND ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME
c0zc0224 MOREOVER THE COMPANIES SET UP AN INFORMAL ARBITRATION PROCESS THAT THEY SAY ENSURES THAT NOTHING WILL GO AHEAD UNTIL ALL NINE REACH A CONSENSUS
c0zc0225 MR. CANION ACKNOWLEDGES THE POSSIBILITY THAT A COMPANY COULD LIKE THE SOVIET UNION IN THE U. N. SECURITY COUNCIL HOLD UP SOMETHING SIMPLY BY SAYING NYET
c0zc0226 BUT HE SAYS NO ONE HAS INVOKED THAT PRIVILEGE THUS FAR
c0zc0227 CONGRESS HAS PROBABLY OUTGROWN MASSIVE HOUSING PROGRAMS BUT THE LEAST DANGEROUS BRANCH IS JUST FLEXING ITS MUSCLES IN A WAY ELECTED POLITICIANS NEVER WOULD
c0zc0228 THE COURTS HAVE PUT THE PEOPLE OF YONKERS UNDER A THREATENING CLOUD
c0zc0229 WHO'S NEXT
c0zc022a THE INDICTMENTS ALLEGE THAT MESSRS.
c0zc022b MARTINO AND ORLOFF APPROVED MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR WORK DONE LARGELY BY HANLEY WORLDWIDE
c0zc022c THEY RECEIVED PAYMENTS IN CASH AND IN THE FORM OF CLOTHES CLUB MEMBERSHIPS AND PAYMENT OF PERSONAL BILLS ACCORDING TO THE CHARGES
c0zc022d EVER SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO MR. GORBACHEV HAS SOUGHT TO INCREASE FOREIGN TRADE'S MEAGER SHARE OF THE SOVIET ECONOMY
c0zc022e RATHER THAN SIMPLY IMPORT MORE WESTERN GOODS HE WOULD LIKE TO OBTAIN THE MACHINERY AND KNOW HOW TO ENABLE THE SOVIETS TO MAKE THE GOODS THEMSELVES
c0zc022f TO DO SO HE OPENED UP THE ECONOMY TO FOREIGN CAPITAL AND EQUIPMENT BY PERMITTING JOINT VENTURES
c0zc022g HIGHER COMMISSIONS CAN ALSO REDUCE THE INVESTMENT VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES THAT INCLUDE A SAVINGS COMPONENT SUCH AS UNIVERSAL LIFE POLICIES
c0zc022h IN GENERAL POLICIES WITH HIGHER COMMISSIONS HAVE LOWER SURRENDER VALUES
c0zc022i THAT'S WHAT POLICYHOLDERS GET IF THEY CASH IN THE POLICY OR WHAT THEY CAN BORROW THROUGH POLICY LOANS
c10c0202 THERE ARE ALWAYS PROBLEMS WITH NEW PLANS HE SAID
c10c0203 THE B. ONE HOWEVER IS A VERY GOOD BOMBER
c10c0206 GASOLINE STATION SALES ROSE TWO PERCENT AFTER A ONE POINT NINE PERCENT INCREASE
c10c0207 SOME OF THAT INCREASE WAS PROBABLY BECAUSE OF HIGHER PRICES HOWEVER
c10c020a MR. MULFORD WELCOMED THESE AND OTHER RECENT JAPANESE FINANCIAL INITIATIVES
c10c020d TRUSTCORP SAID ITS PLAN TO COMPLETE THE PURCHASE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER
c10c020f TRUSTCORP INCORPORATED IS A HOLDING COMPANY WITH ASSETS OF FOUR POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS
c10c020g REGARDLESS OF WHAT POLITICAL LABEL THEY THINK IS APPROPRIATE ALMOST EVERYONE REGARDS GEORGE BUSH AS A DECENT HONEST AND LIKABLE PERSON
c10c020h AND MOST WOULD AGREE THAT HIS PERSONAL HISTORY HAS A STORYBOOK QUALITY ABOUT IT
c10c020i SOMEBODY ONCE SAID GEORGE BUSH HAS LED THE LIFE THAT RONALD REAGAN PORTRAYS SAYS PETE TEELEY A LONGTIME AIDE
c10c020j RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
c10c020k THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT
c10c020l THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
c10c020m DOCTORS ARE NERVOUS MS. ADAMS SAYS
c10c020o DOCTORS ARE TRAINED TO DEAL WITH DISEASE NOT HEALTH
c10c020r YOU HAVE TO EXPECT HIGHER REDEMPTIONS GIVEN ALL THE DIFFICULTY IN THE MARKET
c10c020s BUT IT WAS CONTAINED FAIRLY WELL
c10c020u WHY IS THE U. S. PARTICULARLY DEPENDENT ON NAVAL FORCES
c10c020v WHAT ARE THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF AMERICAN MILITARY PRACTICE AND POLICY
c10c020w THE RELEVANCE OF THESE ISSUES AND THEODORE ROOSEVELT'S EVENHANDED DISCUSSION OF THEM OBLIGE INTERESTED STUDENTS OF WAR TO READ THE BOOK AND HISTORIANS TO COPY IT
c10c020y FOLLOWING STRONG SHOWINGS IN RECENT PRIMARIES HE HAS NEARLY AS MANY DELEGATES AS GOVERNOR MICHAEL DUKAKIS OF MASSACHUSETTS THE FRONT RUNNER
c10c020z HIS PERFORMANCE SO FAR SUGGESTS SOME ABILITY TO REACH A LIBERAL CONSTITUTION BEYOND THE BLACK VOTE THAT PROVIDES THE BULK OF HIS SUPPORT
c10c0210 THIS SUCCESS SPRINGS FROM A COMBINATION OF PERSONALITY AND POPULISM
c10c0211 HE PREACHES BASIC VALUES AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE WORKERS IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE
c10c0212 STOP DRUGS FROM FLOWING IN AND STOP JOBS FROM FLOWING OUT
c10c0213 THE TEAM SAYS THIS KIND OF ACTION PROTECTS ITS VALUABLE PLAYERS FROM ABUSE
c10c0216 I TOLD JOEY TO GO OUT THERE AND TELL HIM NOT TO DO IT AGAIN SAYS THE COACH
c10c0217 THE MESSAGE GOT THROUGH IF NOT NECESSARILY IN WORDS
c10c0219 BUT HE SAYS JUST WAIT UNTIL WILLOW COMES OUT
c10c021a IT'S GOING TO KNOCK THE SOCKS OFF THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD
c10c021b IT'S BOFFO
c10c021d AND IMPORTS OF OIL AND AUTOS ARE EXPECTED TO BE LOWER FURTHER HELP ENLIGHTEN THE TRADE IMBALANCE
c10c021f THINGS ARE A BIT DULLER THIS YEAR
c10c021h ALL THE ACTION APPARENTLY WILL BE IN THE COURTROOM
c10c021i BUT MR. EDELL HAS ARGUED THAT MRS. CIPOLLONE HEARD CONFLICTING MESSAGES ABOUT THE HAZARDS OF HER HABIT
c10c021k THE CIGARETTE MAKERS' ADVERTISEMENTS REINFORCED THESE PERCEPTIONS AND OTHERS OF THE PRODUCT'S SAFETY THE PLAINTIFF CONTENDS
c10c021l CONISTON AMONG OTHER THINGS IS CALLING FOR A NEW VOTE

c10c021o THE STANDOFF CAST DOUBTS ABOUT HOW SINCERE JAPANESE COMPANIES ARE IN THEIR STATED WILLINGNESS TO BUY MORE U. S. MADE CHIPS
c10c021s HE HAS HELD THE POSITION THREE TIMES IN THE PAST AND WAS BELIEVED EAGER TO HEAD OPEC AGAIN
c10c021u THE FOLLOWING OFFICERS DIRECTORS AND LARGE STOCKHOLDERS OF COMPANIES REPORTED CHANGES IN HOLDINGS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR
c10c021v THOSE IDENTIFIED AS BENEFICIAL OWNERS HOLD AT LEAST TEN PERCENT OF A COMPANY'S EQUITY SECURITIES
c10c021w UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED CHANGES INVOLVED DIRECT HOLDINGS OF COMMON STOCK AND TOOK PLACE IN MAY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
c10c021x COMPANIES ARE LISTED WHERE TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY AGGREGATE TEN THOUSAND SHARES OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
c10c021z HE OBVIOUSLY RELISHES A GOOD FIGHT AND SAYING NO TO THE CULTURAL BARBARIANS AND THE CURRENT WISDOM
c10c0220 HE USES PIG BLADDER HAMMER AND TONGS AND SCALPEL AND HE IS ADEPT WITH THEM ALL AS THE ELECTRIC WINDMILL SHOWS
c10c0221 HELPED BY WEDNESDAY'S WALL STREET RALLY AND IMPROVED COMMODITY PRICES STOCK PRICES POSTED ROBUST GAINS IN SYDNEY
c10c0222 TURNOVER REMAINED THIN
c10c0223 AN EARLY SPURT OF DOMESTIC LED DEMAND DROVE PRICES TO THEIR BEST LEVELS DURING THE FIRST HOUR OF ACTIVITY
c10c0224 THEY DRIFTED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE SESSION AND CLOSED JUST SHORT OF THEIR PEAKS
c10c0226 IDEAS WERE FLOWING
c10c0227 WE WERE SEEING WHAT WORKED FOR EACH OF US
c10c0228 THE TWO OF US WERE TRYING TO THINK OF A WAY TO SATISFY EVERYONE
c10c0229 VIEWERS AND CRITICS SAY THE HUGE LOAD OF ADS AND AIRTIME IS PART OF THE PROBLEM
c10c022a COMMERCIAL CLUTTER SEEMS GREATER THAN IN PREVIOUS OLYMPICS BROADCASTS MANY CRITICS SAY
c10c022c ACTUAL EVENTS AS OPPOSED TO TAPED PROFILES PREVIEWS AND REPORTS TAKE UP LESS THAN HALF OF THE AIRTIME
c10c022d MANY HEADLINE EVENTS DON'T APPEAR UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT
c10c022f FINANCIAL HISTORY HAS WITNESSED A THOUSAND BOOMS AND BUSTS
c10c022g WITHIN RECENT MEMORY WE HAVE SEEN THE JUNK EQUITIES OF THE SIXTIES THE HEATED THIRD WORLD LEADING OF THE SEVENTIES AND THE THRIFT CRISIS OF THE EIGHTIES
c10c022i IF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS CRAZE AWAKEN NOW THE CORRECTION MAY STILL BE WITHIN TOLERABLE LIMITS FOR THE COUNTRY
c10c022j IF NOT ALL OF AMERICA WILL PAY THE PENALTY BECAUSE THE DEBT IS HUGE AND WIDELY HELD AND THE BANKING STRUCTURE'S INTEGRITY WOULD BE AT STAKE
c11c0201 BEFORE BEING HALTED ON THE TORONTO STOCK EXCHANGE MONDAY THE VOTING SHARES TRADED AT FORTY ONE DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS
c11c0202 THE SHARES RESUMED TRADING YESTERDAY
c11c0203 THE VOTING SHARES CLOSED AT SEVENTY DOLLARS UP TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS
c11c0204 THE CLASS A SHARES CLOSED AT FOURTEEN POINT THREE SEVEN FIVE DOLLARS UP SIXTY SEVEN POINT FIVE CENTS
c11c0205 NOW HE SELLS KNOCKOFF GUCCI AND ROLEX WATCHES STARTING AT FIFTY DOLLARS APIECE TO THE SECRETARIES AT HIS PREP SCHOOL
c11c0206 MY STRATEGY IS TO GET THEM ALONE HE EXPLAINS
c11c0207 THEN LATER THEY CAN SHOW OFF THEIR WATCHES AND BRAG ABOUT THEIR GENEROUS HUSBANDS
c11c0208 THE ISSUE IS SO SENSITIVE HERE SAYS BOND ANALYST DANIEL SCOTTO OF L. F. ROTHSCHILD UNTERBERG AND TOWBIN
c11c0209 WE ARE ALL CONCERNED THAT THE REGULATORS CAN SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR CREDIT TO CARRY THE COMPANY OUT INTO THE HORIZON
c11c020a BUT HE ADDED THE BANKERS ARE WAITING FOR COMMITMENTS FROM THE REGULATORS AND THE REGULATORS ARE WAITING FOR COMMITMENTS FROM THE BANKERS
c11c020b THE ACCORD MOST LIKELY WOULD INCLUDE SOME PRIVATE AGREEMENT AMONG MINISTERS ON HOW FAR UP OR DOWN THESE RATES CAN MOVE AND STILL BE ACCEPTABLE
c11c020c BUT OFFICIALS SAID IT IS UNLIKELY THESE LIMITS WOULD BE MADE PUBLIC
c11c020d AND IT ISN'T KNOWN YET WHETHER THE MAJOR POWERS WOULD PLEDGE TO INTERVENE IN CURRENCY MARKETS IF EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO EXCEED THOSE LIMITS
c11c020e THE REMAINING OFFSETTING COLLECTIONS OF MORE THAN THREE BILLION DOLLARS COME FROM USER FEES WHICH ALSO CLEARLY ARE NOT TAXES
c11c020f A USER FEE IS A SPECIFIC CHARGE FOR A DIRECT BENEFIT RECEIVED
c11c020g LIKE AN ASSET SALE BUT UNLIKE A TAX A USER FEE DOES NOT INVOLVE COMPULSION
c11c020h ONE CHARACTERISTIC OF USER FEES IS THAT THEY REVEAL HOW MUCH GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ARE REALLY WORTH TO DIRECT RECIPIENTS IN THE MOST DIRECT AND MEANINGFUL WAY POSSIBLE
c11c020i ONE OF THE STRONGEST ARGUMENTS THAT A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM IS WORTHWHILE OCCURS WHEN IT HAS A USER FEE AND THE FEE COVERS COSTS
c11c020j THE REVERSE IS ALSO TRUE AND THAT IS ONE REASON SOME BENEFICIARIES OPPOSE USER FEES
c11c020k ALLIED WHICH WAS ACQUIRED LAST YEAR FOR THREE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN A HOSTILE TAKEOVER BID BY CAMPEAU CORPORATION HAS TWENTY FOUR DIVISIONS
c11c020l BLOCK'S IS ONE OF SIXTEEN DIVISIONS THAT CAMPEAU MUST SELL TO COMPLY WITH ITS BANK AGREEMENTS
c11c020m BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR THE TORONTO BASED REAL ESTATE CONCERN MUST MEET A ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR BANK OBLIGATION
c11c020n CONSEQUENTLY LLOYD'S AND SOME BROKERS MAY BE FORCED TO INCREASE THEIR SHARE OF THE SETTLEMENT PAYMENT
c11c020o YESTERDAY MINET HOLDINGS P. L. C. SAID ITS PLANNED TEN POINT FIVE MILLION POUND CONTRIBUTION COULD RISE TO TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLION POUNDS
c11c020p LLOYD'S DECLINED TO SPECULATE ABOUT HOW MUCH ITS CONTRIBUTION MIGHT INCREASE
c11c020q THOSE CREDITORS INCLUDE MULTILATERAL AGENCIES LATIN AMERICAN AND SOME EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS AND SHORT TERM COMMERCIAL BANK CREDITORS AND SUPPLIERS
c11c020r PERU RECENTLY RESUMED DEBT PAYMENTS TO THE INTER AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
c11c020s BUT THERE AREN'T ANY CURRENT PLANS TO RESUME PAYMENT TO THE WORLD BANK OR THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE ADVISER SAID
c11c020t THE MERGER RESULTS IN SEVERAL CLIENT CONFLICTS
c11c020u PANASONIC COMPANY A BATES CLIENT IS PLANNING TO LEAVE BECAUSE BACKER HANDLES MAGNAVOX MR. SPIELVOGEL SAID

c11c020w ALSO HELENE CURTIS LIMITED A BACKER CLIENT IS PLANNING TO LEAVE BECAUSE BATES HANDLES CARTER WALLACE INCORPORATED MR. SPIELVOGEL SAID
c11c020x HELENE CURTIS BILLS ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH IS EQUAL TO ABOUT HALF OF CARTER WALLACE'S BILLINGS ACCORDING TO INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES
c11c020y DURABLE GOODS ORDERS ROSE ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT IN JUNE BUT THE GAIN CAME ENTIRELY FROM MILITARY ITEMS
c11c020z THE REPORT WAS CONSIDERED A FURTHER SIGN THAT THE ECONOMY REMAINS WEAK
c11c0210 BUT ANALYSTS SAY MANUFACTURING IS IMPROVING
c11c0211 A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ISSUE OF HOUSEHOLD FINANCE CORPORATION SEVEN YEAR NOTES WAS OFFERED THROUGH UNDERWRITERS LED BY MERRILL LYNCH CAPITAL MARKETS
c11c0212 THE TEN PERCENT NOTES WERE PRICED AT PAR AND THE RETURN IS ZERO POINT SEVEN TWO OF A PERCENTAGE POINT ABOVE THE RATE ON COMPARABLE TREASURY NOTES
c11c0213 THE NOTES ARE RATED DOUBLE A THREE BY MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE INCORPORATED AND DOUBLE A MINUS BY STANDARD AND POOR'S CORPORATION
c11c0214 I TRY TO LEAD A MORAL LIFE SAYS THE THIRTY NINE YEAR OLD SENATOR GORE
c11c0215 PART OF THAT IS WORK AND CHARACTER AND PURPOSE
c11c0216 I THINK THAT LIFE HAS A PURPOSE HE SAYS
c11c0217 HIS TODAY IS BECOMING PRESIDENT
c11c0218 AMERICAN SCIENCE FACES A WORRISOME NEW THREAT
c11c0219 IT STEMS FROM A SHIFT IN THE ATTITUDES OF THE PUBLIC AT LARGE
c11c021a ITS GENESIS IS IGNORANCE AND FEAR OF SCIENCE ITSELF AND OF THE INSTITUTIONS IN WHICH IT IS DONE
c11c021b BROKERAGE SOURCES SAID JAPANESE INVESTMENT TRUSTS ENTERED THE MARKET IN THE AFTERNOON TO HELP NUDGE SHARE PRICES HIGHER FOLLOWING THE MORNING DECLINE
c11c021c SOME PHARMACEUTICAL STOCKS AND BLUE CHIP ELECTRICAL ISSUES SURGED
c11c021d TRADERS THEORIZED THAT INVESTMENT TRUSTS WERE TRYING TO RALLY THE MARKET WITH THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF MAJOR SECURITIES HOUSES TO FORESTALL A SERIOUS DECLINE IN ADVANCE OF THE LONG HOLIDAY WEEKEND
c11c021e THE EXCHANGE WAS CLOSED SATURDAY AND IS CLOSED MONDAY FOR A NATIONAL HOLIDAY
c11c021f FRANK PEREZ A RETIRED DIPLOMAT RECALLS THE DAY HE LEFT FOR A TWO YEAR STINT AS THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION IN TURKEY

c11c021l LAWYER STEVEN ROSS WHOSE BOSS IS HOUSE SPEAKER JIM WRIGHT APPEALED TO THE ENTIRE CIRCUIT WITH NO SUCCESS
c11c021m BUT ROBERT BORK HAS LEFT THE COURT SO MR. ROSS WILL TRY AGAIN
c11c021n THE CIRCUIT HAS NEVER GRANTED A SECOND TRY BUT MR. ROSS SEEMS TO THINK IT'S WORTH ANOTHER SHOT
c11c021o HE SAID ACTIONS HE TOOK ELIMINATED ONE MANAGEMENT LAYER AND WILL CAUSE MORE EXECUTIVES TO REPORT DIRECTLY TO HIM
c11c021p IN THE PAST THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CRITICIZED FOR BEING TOO BUREAUCRATIC AND SLOW MOVING
c11c021q THE NEW MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE WILL SHORTEN THE APPROVAL CYCLE AND COMMUNICATION CYCLE WITH THE COMPANY MR. MCDONNELL SAID
c11c021r THERE'S ALSO LAST YEAR'S MCDONALD'S INCIDENT
c11c021s ACCORDING TO THE OCALA POLICE LOG THE RESTAURANT SUMMONED HELP AFTER MR. NOVEMBER TRIED TO PAY FOR HIS DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY PARTY WITH UNUSUAL LOOKING MONEY

c11c021w THE ONE HUNDRED INDEX WAS OFF NINETEEN POINT SIX AT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY FOUR POINT EIGHT
c11c021x IT WAS EVIDENT TOO THAT AN ENORMOUS DOUBLE STANDARD WAS BEING APPLIED FOR CONGRESSMEN WERE IMMUNE FROM THE LOW THRESHOLD SCRUTINY SPECIAL PROSECUTORS REPRESENT
c11c021y INDEED THEY SEEM NEARLY IMMUNE FROM THE NORMAL PROCESS OF THE LAW
c11c021z WHEN JUSTICE DID TACKLE CORRUPT CONGRESSMEN AS IN THE ABSCAM PROBE IT FACED RETRIBUTION FROM THE HILL IN THE FORM OF EXTENSIVE HEARINGS AND THREATS ABOUT ITS BUDGET
c11c0220 ALAN SCHWARTZ THE PLAINTIFF'S LAWYER OPPOSING BIC SAYS HE COULD HAVE AVOIDED HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF EXTRA WORK BY AGREEING TO TAKE THE DOCUMENTS UNDER A PROTECTIVE ORDER
c11c0221 BUT HE IS LOOKING BEYOND HIS CASE
c11c0222 THE NEXT PERSON INJURED HE EXPLAINS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SAME BATTLE I'VE ENGAGED IN
c11c0223 WARNER LAMBERT AND SCHERING PLOUGH ARE COVETED FOR THEIR OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS AS WELL AS FOR PRESCRIPTION SALES
c11c0224 OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS SUCH AS WARNER LAMBERT'S LISTERINE MOUTHWASH ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE FRANCHISE VALUE
c11c0225 THEY AREN'T RESEARCH INTENSIVE THEY'RE MARKETING INTENSIVE ONE ANALYST SAID
c11c0226 U. S. INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THE TERRORISTS IS CONSIDERED POOR
c11c0227 IT HAS PROVEN DIFFICULT TO INFILTRATE SMALL TERRORIST CELLS WHICH OFTEN ARE HELD TOGETHER BY FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS
c11c0228 AND DURING THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES LEBANESE TERRORISTS KILLED TWO OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY'S TOP MIDDLE EAST OPERATIVES ROBERT AMES AND WILLIAM BUCKLEY
c11c0229 THEN THERE'S BEEN BAD LUCK AND BAD PLANNING
c11c022a THE VOLKSWAGEN FOX SUBCOMPACT WAS ORIGINALLY BROUGHT TO THE U. S. FROM BRAZIL IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AS V. W.'S LATEST ATTEMPT TO MARKET AN ENTRY LEVEL CAR

c11c022g THE OFFICIAL ACKNOWLEDGED BUSINESS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE FREQUENCY OF GOVERNMENT CHANGES IN THE TAX LAW BUT HE DISMISSED THEM
c11c022h STABILITY IS A NICE THING HE SAID
c11c022i BUT IT'S ALWAYS TRUE THAT SYSTEMS WE HAVE IN PLACE HAVE BIASES IN THEM
c11c022j THERE'S NO REASON WE SHOULDN'T WORK ON THEM
c12c0201 MR. LYONS DECIDED AGAINST A COUPLE OF POSSIBLE INVESTMENTS DURING THE SIX MONTHS
c12c0202 THE STOCK MARKET DECLINE LED HIM TO ABANDON THE IDEA OF SEEKING A LOCAL FRANCHISE FOR FROZEN YOGURT STORES
c12c0203 AND THE NEW TAX LAW'S RESTRICTIONS ON DEDUCTING REAL ESTATE LOSSES PERSUADED HIM NOT TO INVEST IN A NEW DAYS INN HOTEL NEAR NEW YORK CITY
c12c0204 ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER SHAMIR ORDERED INCREASED SECURITY IN JERUSALEM FOLLOWING SATURDAY'S STABBING OF TWO JEWISH BROTHERS BY SUSPECTED ARAB GUERRILLAS
c12c0205 JERUSALEM'S MAYOR APPEALED FOR CALM

c12c020b THE FIRM A UNIT OF PAINEWEBBER GROUP INCORPORATED RELEASED A SHORT STATEMENT YESTERDAY IN WHICH IT SAID THE TWO MEN HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY
c12c020c THE FIRM HAS COOPERATED WITH THE U. S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THROUGHOUT THE INVESTIGATION AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO
c12c020e IT'S ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO A SOCIETY WHEN IT GROWS OLD AND TRIES TO KEEP THE STATUS QUO INSTEAD OF LETTING ITS MORE CREATIVE INSTINCTS TAKE OVER
c12c020f ALTHOUGH TUCKER IS SET IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES MR. LUCAS MAKES IT CLEAR HE THINKS THE FILM'S SUBJECT IS CURRENT AND QUITE PERSONAL
c12c020g THE EFFECT OF THE MERGER IS TO HAVE THE NEW PARENT INCORPORATED IN PENNSYLVANIA RATHER THAN OHIO

c12c020w MANY AGREE THERE IS LITTLE TIME TO WASTE IN THE SCRAMBLE TO CREATE BETTER INTERNATIONAL REGULATION

c12c020y INSTEAD DAYTON HUDSON'S EARNINGS HAVE BEEN DEPRESSED FOR MORE THAN A YEAR BY MERCHANDISING PROBLEMS IN ITS MERVYN'S DEPARTMENT STORE UNIT
c12c020z ANALYSTS SAID THE TROUBLE STARTED WITH MERVYN'S CONCENTRATING TOO MUCH ON OPENING NEW STORES AND NOT ENOUGH ON PROVIDING BRAND NAME MERCHANDISE
c12c0210 TOP MANAGEMENT WAS SLOW TO RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEMS SOME ANALYSTS SAID
c12c0211 AND MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN TOO OPTIMISTIC IN PREDICTING THE TIMING OF A TURNAROUND THE ANALYSTS SAID
c12c0212 OTHER GAFFES MAKE VOTERS QUESTION HIS GRASP OF ISSUES

c12c0214 THE AVID JOGGER EVERY MORNING AT SIX A. M. AND MOUNTAIN CLIMBER ONCE A WEEK COMES CLOSE TO CONCEDING INTELLECTUAL FAILINGS

c12c021b THE PENTAGON PROPOSED INCREASING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE ACCOUNTS BY TWO POINT FOUR PERCENT IN THE COMING FISCAL YEAR
c12c021c THESE PAY FOR TRAINING SHIP STEAMING HOURS AND THE COSTS OF KEEPING WEAPONS IN GOOD REPAIR
c12c021d MR. CARLUCCI EMPHASIZED THAT IT IS PREFERABLE TO KEEP A SMALLER FORCE THAT IS ADEQUATELY PAID AND READY TO FIGHT THAN TO HAVE A LARGER FORCE THAT ISN'T
c12c021e IT WOULD BE A DISASTER IF WE REPEAT THE EXPERIENCE OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHERE YOU KEEP THE FRAMEWORK BUT HOLLOW IT OUT HE SAID
c12c021f THE ORDER CARRIED OUT THE SHIP TAKES OFF AT FLANK SPEED FROM THE BARENTS HEADED SOUTH TO AVOID DETECTION
c12c021h NONE WITH WASHINGTON NONE WITH OTHER SHIPS NO SIGNALS FROM THE USUAL COMMERCIAL STATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD
c12c021i MR. YOUNKER ALSO MADE IT CLEAR TO THE CONTRACTORS THAT IF THEY PERFORMED WELL THEY WOULD RECEIVE GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS ONCE THEY WERE FINISHED
c12c021j DURING THE FIVE MONTH PROJECT HE INTRODUCED THE CONTRACTORS TO EXECUTIVES AND SENIOR MANAGERS AT JOHNSON AND JOHNSON GIVING THEM WHAT HE CALLS AIR TIME
c12c021k LATER THE CONTRACTORS USED THE EXECUTIVES FOR REFERENCES ON OTHER PROJECTS
c12c021l THE KING'S REQUEST LEFT THE DELEGATES IN A TIGHT SPOT
c12c021m TO IGNORE JORDAN AND MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL FORMAL CASH PLEDGE TO THE P. L. O. WOULD SIGNAL A SHIFT AWAY FROM MODERATION DIFFICULT FOR THE GULF STATES TO COUNTENANCE

c13c0215 THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR THE NEW STRENGTH IN THE SWEDISH ECONOMY
c13c0216 SOME OF THEM CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE ECONOMIC POLICIES PURSUED BY OUR GOVERNMENT WHICH IS LED BY THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY
c13c0217 SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS ARE DUE TO THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY AND THE HALVING OF OIL PRICES
c13c0218 THE IMPROVEMENT HAS GIVEN SWEDISH POLITICIANS TIME TO CONSIDER WHAT CHANGES ARE NEEDED IN A LONGER PERSPECTIVE TO ENSURE A CONTINUATION OF A FAVORABLE ECONOMIC SITUATION
c13c0219 MOST OF BOZELL'S REVLON RELATED REVENUE LAST YEAR CAME FROM MEDIA PLACEMENTS

c13c021z THE PHILIPPINES IS OF COURSE A TOUGH COUNTRY TO GOVERN
c13c0220 IT REFLECTS CREDIT ON MRS. AQUINO THAT SHE HAS STUCK TO HER DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES THROUGH FIVE COUP ATTEMPTS AS WELL AS NONSTOP POLITICAL DOGFIGHTS
c13c0221 MRS. AQUINO UNDERSTANDS CORRECTLY THAT AS THE ELECTED PRESIDENT SHE IS ABOVE SUCH NONSENSE
c13c0222 HER RESPONSIBILITY IS TO THE VOTERS WHO RECOGNIZED THE NATION'S DESPERATE NEED FOR REFORM AND GAVE HER THEIR MANDATE

c14c0229 CHANGE WILL COME SLOWLY BECAUSE JAPANESE SOCIETY STILL HAS A STRONG TENDENCY TO HAMMER DOWN ANY NAIL THAT STICKS UP
c14c022b THERE MAY BE SCADS OF MONEY IN JAPAN BUT THERE IS PRECIOUS LITTLE VENTURE CAPITAL
