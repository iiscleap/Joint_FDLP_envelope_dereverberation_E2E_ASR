c1rc0216 ANOTHER REFORM MINDED LEADER NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV TRIED TO KICK START THE SOVIET ECONOMY IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES AND WAS SENT PACKING
c1rc0217 NEARLY TWENTY YEARS OF ECONOMIC MISMANAGEMENT FOLLOWED

c1rc021a SOURCES SAID THAT IN THE CONTRACT TALKS BEING HELD IN LONDON IRAQI MARKETING OFFICIALS ARE INSISTING THAT TWO MAJOR OIL COMPANIES ALREADY HAVE SIGNED

c1rc0229 AFTER NEARLY EIGHT YEARS OF THE REAGAN PRESIDENCY A KIND OF MORNING AFTER MOOD PREVAILS HERE
c1rc022a THERE IS A SENSE THAT MR. REAGAN'S SUCCESSOR HASN'T ANY CHOICE BUT TO BE A CONSOLIDATION PRESIDENT

c1sc0208 AGENCIES GENERALLY DON'T USE UNDERCOVER TESTERS POSING AS PROSPECTIVE TENANTS AS THEY DO IN RACE DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS THEY FEAR THAT THE TESTER COULD BE ATTACKED

c1sc020e THEIR VIEWS ARE SOUND ENOUGH BUT EACH IS ONLY ONE RECIPE ON LIFE'S MENU
c1sc020f YET THEY MUST ALL BE VEGETARIANS
c1sc020g IT'S THE LIFE OF AN ENTREPRENEUR AND THE FATE OF CREATIVITY IN A MODERN FINANCIALLY ORIENTED AMERICA MR. LUCAS SAYS WARMING TO THE SUBJECT
c1sc020h IT'S ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO A SOCIETY WHEN IT GROWS OLD AND TRIES TO KEEP THE STATUS QUO INSTEAD OF LETTING ITS MORE CREATIVE INSTINCTS TAKE OVER
c1sc020i ALTHOUGH TUCKER IS SET IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES MR. LUCAS MAKES IT CLEAR HE THINKS THE FILM'S SUBJECT IS CURRENT AND QUITE PERSONAL
c1sc020j SECOND THERE WAS MR. KINNOCK HIMSELF
c1sc020k HIS STRATEGISTS AND POLL TAKERS HAVE LONG KNOWN THAT MOST BRITISH VOTERS HAVE ONLY A FUZZY IDEA OF WHAT KIND OF MAN HE IS

c1sc020m PEOPLE GENERALLY RESPECT MRS. THATCHER BUT NOT MANY REALLY LIKE HER

c1sc0216 THE EGYPTIANS WERE UNHAPPY WITH MANY OF THE RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR PARTICIPATION BUT NEVERTHELESS OPTED FOR THE M. ONE OVER ALTERNATIVES FROM BRITAIN FRANCE AND BRAZIL
c1sc0217 THE BOTTOM LINE WAS THAT THEY COULD USE OUR GRANTS TO BUY IN SAID AN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL
c1sc0218 IT'S NOT GOING TO COST THEM A THING
c1sc021a I SEE NO REASON WHY THEY CAN'T IF AS THEY CONTEND THEY ARE CONFIDENT ABOUT THE CORRECTNESS OF THEIR POSITION
c1sc021b THEY WOULD WIN THE ADMIRATION OF THE WORLD FOR WHAT WOULD BE VIEWED AS A MAGNANIMOUS ACTION
c1sc021c AN ATMOSPHERE OF GREATER TRUST IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS WOULD BE CREATED AND PAVE THE WAY FOR OTHER MAJOR ADVANCES
c1sc021d MORE TO THE POINT AN UNCONDITIONAL PULLOUT WOULD COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF REPRESENTATION OF THE AFGHAN PEOPLE IN THE GENEVA TALKS
c1sc021e AN EASTERN SPOKESMAN SAID THE FILINGS ARE WITHOUT MERIT
c1sc021f THE FACT IS THAT EASTERN AND CONTINENTAL ARE TWO DISTINCT COMPANIES WITH OPERATIONS THAT ARE QUITE SEPARATE HE SAID
c1sc021g THERE REALLY SHOULD BE NO QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT
c1sc021h THE TRADE BILL WOULD DIRECT PRESIDENTIAL ACTION AGAINST COUNTRIES AND PERMIT PIRACY OF U. S. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
c1sc021i IT WOULD REQUIRE THE PRESIDENT TO IDENTIFY COUNTRIES THAT DON'T PROTECT COPYRIGHTS AND PATENTS AND TO INITIATE EXPEDITED UNFAIR TRADE INVESTIGATIONS IN THE MOST EGREGIOUS CASES
c1sc021j THE PRESIDENT COULD NOT DECLINE TO MOVE AGAINST CERTAIN COUNTRIES IF DOING SO WOULD BE AGAINST THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC INTEREST THOUGH
c1sc021k CONGRESS WANTS SPEEDY ACTION BECAUSE TIME OFTEN CAN BE CRITICAL IN WINNING PROTECTION FOR CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SUCH AS COMPUTER SOFTWARE WHICH CAN BE COPIED RAPIDLY
c1sc021l CONGRESS ALSO NEEDS TO TAKE STEPS TO IMPROVE ITS OWN ABILITY TO PROTECT SECRETS
c1sc021m CURRENT PROCEDURES ALMOST REQUIRE AN OPERATION'S COVER TO BE BLOWN BEFORE THE OPERATION CAN BE DISCUSSED OUTSIDE OF COMMITTEE
c1sc021n IF CONGRESS HAD ADEQUATE SECURITY LAWS AND PROCEDURES WITH STIFF PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS THE END RESULT PROBABLY WOULD BE MORE FRANK DISCUSSION NOT LESS

c1sc022c THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT AFTER A DAY SPENT IDLING ON AN L. A. FREEWAY IT'S POSSIBLE TO FEEL THE EFFECTS OF OZONE
c1sc022d BUT WHAT EXACTLY IS ITS THREAT TO LIFE OR HEALTH
c1sc022e THE BULK OF THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE EFFECTS OF OZONE WHEEZING COUGHING AND TIGHTENING IN THE CHEST ARE SHORT TERM AND REVERSIBLE
c1sc022f THESE EFFECTS BEGIN AT OZONE LEVELS TWO OR THREE TIMES THE FEDERAL STANDARD THOUGH A FEW STUDIES DETECTED SLIGHT EFFECTS AT JUST ABOVE THE STANDARD
c1sc022g PEOPLE DOING HEAVY EXERCISE WHEN OZONE IS TWO OR THREE TIMES THE STANDARD MAY EXPERIENCE A TEMPORARY LOSS OF LUNG CAPACITY FROM SEVEN PERCENT TO FIFTEEN PERCENT

c1tc0202 HER REAL ESTATE CLIENTS WERE BRACING TO SUFFER UNDER A REVISED TAX CODE POSSIBLY A HARBINGER OF HARDER TIMES FOR HER COMPANY AS WELL
c1tc0203 AND THERE WAS A CONTINUING STREAM OF FAILURES IN DALLAS'S DEPRESSED REAL ESTATE AND ENERGY SECTORS
c1tc0204 NOBODY DOUBTS THAT CHINA'S PRAGMATIC LEADERS SEEK TO IMPROVE THE INVESTOR ENVIRONMENT AND THE STEPS TAKEN SO FAR ARE HELPING SOME FINANCIALLY TROUBLED JOINT VENTURES

c1tc020p THAT CARRIER HAD MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TICKETS THAT NEEDED TO BE REFUNDED WHEN ITS OPERATIONS WERE JOINED WITH CONTINENTAL'S THE SPOKESMAN SAID
c1tc020q HE INSISTED THAT MOST OF THE REFUNDS WERE COMPLETED
c1tc020r MR. BERGER CLAIMS THE PROBLEM GOES BEYOND SIMPLY RECOVERING THE COST OF IMPROVEMENTS
c1tc020s BECAUSE THE LOFT BOARD'S REIMBURSEMENT ALLOWANCES ARE SO LOW HE SAYS BANKS WON'T MAKE THE LOANS FOR THE WORK
c1tc020t HE SAYS HE FINANCED HIS IMPROVEMENTS BY TAKING A SECOND MORTGAGE ON ANOTHER BUILDING THAT HE OWNS
c1tc020u THE BOTTOM LINE HE SAYS IS THAT THESE BUILDINGS CANNOT BE MADE SAFE UNDER THESE RULES
c1tc020v THE JOB WILL NOT GET DONE
c1tc020w THE DECISION HAS CONSIDERABLE IMMEDIATE PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE
c1tc020x MORE THAN A DOZEN OTHER APPEALS RAISING THE ARBITRATION ISSUE HAVE BEEN FILED WITH THE SUPREME COURT

c1tc0211 BUT THE STATE CONTRIBUTION MAY REQUIRE THE MONEY TO BE RETURNED DIRECTLY TO TAXPAYERS
c1tc0212 THAT APPEARS MORE IN LINE WITH REPUBLICAN THINKING
c1tc0213 REPUBLICANS ASKED HOW TO DISBURSE THE SURPLUS SPLIT FIFTY TO FIFTY BETWEEN SCHOOLS AND PERSONAL TAX REBATES
c1tc0214 NINE OF THE TEN DEATHS IN THE PAST THREE YEARS OCCURRED WHEN CHILDREN WERE STRANGLED BY STRINGS USED TO TIE THE PACIFIERS AROUND THEIR NECKS
c1tc0215 COMMISSION REGULATIONS PROHIBIT THE SALE OF PACIFIERS WITH STRINGS AND REQUIRE A LABEL WARNING AGAINST THIS PRACTICE
c1tc0216 ANY FURTHER EFFORT TO REDUCE THE HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH PACIFIERS WOULD DIVERT ATTENTION AND RESOURCES FROM GREATER DANGERS AND THE WARNINGS PROBABLY WOULD CAUSE NEEDLESS WORRY
c1tc0217 ON THE SUBJECT OF COMPUTER RESERVATIONS SYSTEMS YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD
c1tc0218 THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR RULES GOVERNING THE OPERATION OF C. R. S. SYSTEMS LED TO PUBLICATION OF UNREALISTIC SCHEDULES BY THE AIRLINES TO GET BETTER SCREEN POSITIONS
c1tc0219 THIS RESULTED IN MORE DELAYS AND A LOT OF PASSENGER FRUSTRATION
c1tc021a IN RETROSPECT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE IN C. R. S. SYSTEMS WAS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE

c1tc021h A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT AND AN APPEALS COURT BOTH IN RICHMOND UPHELD THE PLAN
c1tc021i BUT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE SUPREME COURT TOLD THE APPEALS COURT TO RECONSIDER ITS DECISION IN LIGHT OF ANOTHER HIGH COURT RULING
c1tc021j LAST JULY THE APPEALS COURT STRUCK DOWN THE PLAN RULING THAT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION MUST BE BASED ON EVIDENCE THAT THE CITY ITSELF HAD DISCRIMINATED IN THE PAST

c1tc022d IT IS BELIEVED THAT EXXON WAS OUTBID FOR SEVERAL RESERVE PACKAGES LEAVING IT WITH A LOT OF CASH THAT COULD STILL BE EARMARKED FOR ACQUISITIONS
c1tc022e AT THE HOUSTON PETROLEUM CLUB INDUSTRY OFFICIALS COULDN'T EAT LUNCH OF LATE WITHOUT DISCUSSING SPECULATION THAT EXXON WAS GOING TO WALK AWAY WITH ALL OF THE TENNECO PROPERTIES

c1uc0203 AND A GENERAL STRIKE HAS BEEN TENTATIVELY SET FOR DECEMBER TWELFTH
c1uc0204 MR. STEWARD WHO HAS MAINTAINED A MR. CLEAN REPUTATION IN THE TOUGH AND SOMETIMES SHADY WORLD OF BOXING IS HIMSELF A MULTIMILLIONAIRE
c1uc0205 HE ARRANGES MATCHES FOR THE BOXERS HE DEVELOPS AND THUS GETS A CUT OF THE PURSE
c1uc0206 IF THE BOXERS ARE CHAMPIONS THE PURSES ARE BIG
c1uc0207 HE DRIVES A GOLD LINCOLN TOWN CAR AND A CARDINAL RED ROLLS ROYCE CORNICHE
c1uc0208 MR. STEWARD RESIDES IN AN AFFLUENT SECTION OF WEST DETROIT WHERE HE OWNS SEVEN HOMES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD USING SOME OF THEM TO HOUSE THE FURNITURE HE COLLECTS
c1uc0209 THE NEXT STEP REQUIRING BUILDING OWNERS TO RETROFIT OLD BUILDINGS WITH SPRINKLERS IS FAR MORE CONTROVERSIAL
c1uc020a ONLY TEN PERCENT TO FIFTEEN PERCENT OF NONRESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS IN THE U. S. HAVE SPRINKLER SYSTEMS ESTIMATES THE NATIONAL FIRE SPRINKLER ASSOCIATION A TRADE GROUP
c1uc020b RETROFITTING BUILDINGS WITH SPRINKLERS USUALLY COSTS TWO DOLLARS TO THREE DOLLARS A SQUARE FOOT TOO MUCH TO MAKE THEM PRACTICAL BUILDING OWNERS ARGUE
c1uc020c HAD THAT HAPPENED THE FAILED BANKS WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER TO THE F. D. I. C. FOR DISPOSITION
c1uc020d IN MOST CASES THE AGENCY SELLS THE FAILED BANK TO ANOTHER INSTITUTION ALONG WITH THE GOOD LOANS
c1uc020e THE F. D. I. C. PURCHASES THE BAD LOANS AND TRIES TO SALVAGE WHATEVER IT CAN
c1uc020f IN A RELATED MATTER OAKWOOD ESTIMATED THAT IT HAD A NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX OPERATING LOSS OF FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IT DIDN'T ESTIMATE REVENUE
c1uc020g THE COMPANY ADDED THAT IT MAY WRITE DOWN SOME ASSETS BECAUSE OF REDUCED COMMODITY PRICES AND NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDELINES
c1uc020h FINAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR HAVEN'T BEEN POSTED
c1uc020i MR. BAKER DECLINED TO GIVE SPECIFICS OF THE COMPROMISE BEYOND SAYING THAT IT MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THEIR PROBLEM AND MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF OUR PROBLEM
c1uc020j HE ADDED HOWEVER THAT HE HAS FOR NOW WITHDRAWN THE PROPOSED COMPROMISE OFFER
c1uc020k WE'RE BACK TO SQUARE ONE HE SAID
c1uc020l THE MAJOR LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES DIDN'T REJECT THE COMPROMISE BUT THEY WEREN'T READY TO ACCEPT IT A U. S. ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL EXPLAINED
c1uc020m THE SALE ALSO PROVIDES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH CASH AS IT TRIES TO NARROW THE BUDGET DEFICIT
c1uc020n AFTER SUBTRACTING UNDERWRITERS' FEES OF ABOUT SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS THE GOVERNMENT'S NET PROCEEDINGS FROM THE OFFERING ARE ONE POINT FIVE EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS
c1uc020o IN ADDITION THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM CONRAIL'S CASH RESERVES UNDER PROVISIONS OF THE PUBLIC OFFERING
c1uc020p AN ENGINEERED SYSTEMS SPOKESMAN SAID THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY AND INTENT TO PAY THE DEBT IN INSTALLMENTS OVER AN EIGHTEEN MONTH PERIOD
c1uc020q HE WOULDN'T SAY WHETHER THE COMPANY WOULD PAY IMMEDIATELY
c1uc020r HE SAID NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE BANK A UNIT OF WELLS FARGO AND COMPANY ARE CONTINUING
c1uc020s CONVENTIONAL WISDOM ECONOMISTS SCOFF AT THIS AND COUNSEL THE WORLD'S LEADERS TO KEEP SWINGING AWAY AT THE TRADE BALANCE
c1uc020t THE MARKET'S ATTACK ON THE DOLLAR SUGGESTS THAT THIS IS A FAILED AND DANGEROUS POLICY
c1uc020u IT IS TIME TO START TALKING ABOUT THE ALTERNATIVE
c1uc020v DESPITE THE DECLINE IN STOCK PRICES TRADING VOLUME WASN'T OVERWHELMING
c1uc020w MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED NINETY THREE POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE COMPARED WITH ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION MONDAY
c1uc020x BUT TRADERS ASSERTED THAT MUCH OF THE LATE ACTIVITY CAME FROM PROFESSIONALS
c1uc020y FINALLY WASHINGTON MUST ABANDON DEBILITATING OR COUNTERPRODUCTIVE MEASURES
c1uc020z IT SHOULD ESPECIALLY AVOID FUNDING BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL AID PROGRAMS THAT MERELY ENCOURAGE THIRD WORLD NATIONS TO EMBRACE THE FAILED PRINCIPLES OF CENTRALIZED PLANNING
c1uc0210 NOR NEED THE U. S. BECOME THE ARBITER OF THIRD WORLD DEBT PROBLEMS AND FASHION A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION
c1uc0211 DEBTOR NATIONS AND PRIVATE WESTERN CREDITORS CAN MORE EFFECTIVELY RESOLVE SHORT TERM DIFFICULTIES ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS
c1uc0212 LONG TERM SOLUTIONS AWAIT THE ADOPTION OF MARKET REFORMS IN THE DEBTOR COUNTRIES REFORMS THAT CURRENT U. S. TRADE AND FOREIGN AID POLICIES TRAGICALLY DELAY
c1uc0213 THROUGHOUT THE THIRTIES PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S ADVISERS WORRIED ABOUT THE LACK OF BUSINESS CONFIDENCE
c1uc0214 THIS INTANGIBLE HAD A PRACTICAL ASPECT THAT CAN BE DIRECTLY TRACED TO THE TAX INCREASES
c1uc0215 ALTHOUGH BY NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN TOTAL REAL OUTPUT HAD RETURNED TO THE LEVEL OF NINETEEN TWENTY NINE MR. STEIN OBSERVES PRIVATE INVESTMENT REMAINED ONE THIRD LOWER
c1uc0216 EVEN THIS RECOVERY WAS LOST IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT WHEN G. N. P. FELL SIX POINT FOUR PERCENT
c1uc0217 THE TOP INCOME TAX RATE HAD RISEN TO SIXTY EIGHT PERCENT INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX COLLECTIONS IN FISCAL NINETEEN THIRTY NINE FELL TWENTY PERCENT
c1uc0218 PRATT AND WHITNEY SAID LAST WEEK IT MIGHT LAY OFF EMPLOYEES AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR BECAUSE OF DECREASED DEMAND FOR JET ENGINES AND PARTS
c1uc0219 THE COMPANY DECLINED TO DISCUSS HOW MANY EMPLOYEES MIGHT BE LAID OFF OR IF THE LOSS WOULD BE PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY
c1uc021a BUT UNION OFFICIALS SAID THE COMPANY HAS TOSSED AROUND NUMBERS FROM ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND
c1uc021b SOME CRITICS SEE THE GROWTH CONTROL MOVEMENT AS THE INDULGENCE OF A SELF SATISFIED MIDDLE CLASS
c1uc021c AND SOME CHARGE THAT THERE ARE RACIST ROOTS
c1uc021d THE FACT IS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE SEEING HISPANICS AND ASIANS AROUND SAYS DANIEL GARCIA THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOS ANGELES PLANNING COMMISSION
c1uc021e THE COMPANY SAYS IT INTENDS TO PURCHASE THOSE SHARES TENDERED AT OR BELOW TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS A SHARE
c1uc021f SHARES TENDERED AT HIGHER PRICES WILL BE RETURNED TO HOLDERS TORCHMARK SAID
c1uc021g IN NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING FRIDAY TORCHMARK CLOSED AT TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS UP ONE DOLLAR AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS
c1uc021h FORD'S FOURTH QUARTER SALES WERE EIGHTEEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS UP FIFTEEN PERCENT FROM SIXTEEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR EARLIER
c1uc021i FULL YEAR SALES ROSE FOURTEEN PERCENT TO SEVENTY ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS FROM SIXTY TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS
c1uc021j THAT LARGE JUMP ENABLED FORD TO INCREASE ITS SHARE OF THE U. S. NEW CAR MARKET TO TWENTY POINT TWO PERCENT FROM EIGHTEEN POINT TWO PERCENT
c1uc021k DAVID DENTON AN ASSOCIATE U. S. ATTORNEY IN MANHATTAN DEFENDS THE GOVERNMENT'S TACTICS
c1uc021l SEARCH WARRANTS ARE USED WHEN THEY APPEAR APPROPRIATE IN A PARTICULAR CASE MR. DENTON SAYS NOTING THAT A FEDERAL MAGISTRATE OR JUDGE MAKES THE DETERMINATION
c1uc021m IN OAKLEY SUTTON'S CASE THE GOVERNMENT SUBMITTED A SEALED AFFIDAVIT TO SUPPORT ITS REQUEST FOR THE WARRANT
c1uc021n ACCORDING TO PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE INVESTIGATION THE AFFIDAVIT CONTAINS INFORMATION PROVIDED BY A DISGRUNTLED FORMER OAKLEY SUTTON EMPLOYEE WHO WAS FIRED PRIOR TO THE RAID
c1uc021o MR. DENTON NOTES THAT FEDERAL AGENTS ARE ROUTINELY ARMED AND THAT THE LARGE NUMBER OF AGENTS USED MAY SIMPLY REFLECT THE VOLUME OF DOCUMENTS BEING SEIZED
c1uc021p IN ADDITION LAURENTIAN SAID BERNHARD M. KOCH THIRTY THREE WAS NAMED VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
c1uc021q HE SUCCEEDS JOHN STROM WHO TRANSFERRED TO A LAURENTIAN CAPITAL UNIT
c1uc021r PREVIOUSLY MR. KOCH WAS DIRECTOR OF INTERNAL AUDIT AT LAURENTIAN GROUP CORPORATION AND IMPERIAL LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY OF CANADA MAJORITY SHAREHOLDERS OF LAURENTIAN CAPITAL
c1uc021s JUST BEFORE THE OCTOBER NINETEENTH GLOBAL EQUITIES CRASH HONGKONG BANK ECONOMISTS EXPRESSED SIMILAR CONCERN ABOUT THE SPECULATION THAT THEN DOMINATED THE LOCAL STOCK MARKET
c1uc021t THEIR PROPERTY REPORT RECALLS THE EQUITIES CRASH AS A REMINDER THAT ASSET VALUES CANNOT DEFY GRAVITY FOR EVER
c1uc021u THIS WARNING NOW REPRESENTS A MINORITY VIEW
c1uc021v BUT CRITICS CHARGED THAT THE COLLAR ACTUALLY ADDED TO VOLATILITY BY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR INDEX ARBITRAGERS TO DO THEIR BUSINESS
c1uc021w MANY TRADERS ARGUE THAT SUCH ARBITRAGE HAS THE EFFECT OF SMOOTHING OUT VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS
c1uc021x INDEX ARBITRAGERS BUY AND SELL LARGE AMOUNTS OF STOCKS AND STOCK INDEX FUTURES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BRIEF PRICE DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO RELATED INSTRUMENTS
c1uc021y SECRETARIES ARE ALSO EASY TARGETS FOR A HUG ESPECIALLY IN HOLLYWOOD
c1uc021z I'VE SEEN A WRITER WALK INTO AN OFFICE AND PULL A SECRETARY UP AGAINST HIM
c1uc0220 SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SAYS CHARLES FRIES CHAIRMAN OF FRIES ENTERTAINMENT INCORPORATED
c1uc0221 THIS WAS A TEMPORARY SETBACK FOR BANK OF NEW YORK
c1uc0222 BUT LAST AUGUST THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TOLD BANCA COMMERCIALE THAT IT MUST FILE AN APPLICATION WITH THE FED AS PART OF THE ITALIAN BANK'S BID
c1uc0223 BANCA COMMERCIALE CALLED THE FED'S REQUIREMENTS UNACCEPTABLE AND DROPPED ITS BID
c1uc0224 MOST ECONOMISTS IN THE U. S. SEE THE U. S. TRADE DEFICIT ALSO SHRINKING
c1uc0225 THAT SHOULD HELP JAPAN
c1uc0226 BUT JAPANESE FEAR THAT EMOTIONS AIRED IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WILL BE BAD NEWS FOR THEM WHOEVER WINS
c1uc0227 LISTENING TO DEMOCRAT MICHAEL DUKAKIS IS JUST LIKE SEEING THE GHOST OF U. S.
c1uc0229 BUT THE PAPER ADDS THE LIKELIHOOD OF A BUSH VICTORY DOESN'T MEAN WE WILL BE SAFE
c1uc022a INDEED THE NEW U. S. TRADE BILL GIVES THE WHITE HOUSE LESS ROOM TO SIDESTEP PUNISHING JAPAN FOR TRADE VIOLATIONS
c1uc022b UNDER PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS CORPORATE BAILOUTS AND RESTRUCTURINGS WERE COMMON
c1uc022c BUT SOME LED TO CHARGES OF CORRUPTION THAT ARE NOW BEING INVESTIGATED IN THE OPPOSITION CONTROLLED NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
c1uc022d PRESIDENT ROH TAE WOO'S GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WANT TO PROVOKE SIMILAR SUSPICIONS NOR DOES IT WANT TO APPEAR TO BE SHORING UP ANOTHER FAILING COMPANY AT TAXPAYERS' EXPENSE
c1uc022e THE DOLLAR WAS CONFINED TO FAIRLY NARROW RANGES IN ASIAN AND EARLY EUROPEAN TRADING AS MARKET PARTICIPANTS CONCENTRATED ON MARK YEN TRADING
c1uc022f THE GERMAN CURRENCY TRADED IN A RANGE BETWEEN SEVENTY THREE POINT THREE OH YEN AND SEVENTY THREE POINT SIX FIVE YEN THROUGH MOST OF NEW YORK TRADING
c1uc022g AT THE NEW YORK FINISH THE MARK WAS UNCHANGED AT SEVENTY THREE POINT FOUR SIX YEN
c1uc022h HIGHER COMMISSIONS CAN ALSO REDUCE THE INVESTMENT VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES THAT INCLUDE A SAVINGS COMPONENT SUCH AS UNIVERSAL LIFE POLICIES
c1uc022i IN GENERAL POLICIES WITH HIGHER COMMISSIONS HAVE LOWER SURRENDER VALUES
c1uc022j THAT'S WHAT POLICYHOLDERS GET IF THEY CASH IN THE POLICY OR WHAT THEY CAN BORROW THROUGH POLICY LOANS
c1vc0201 THE ENERGY CONCERN SAID ITS BOARD MET THURSDAY AND WILL MEET AGAIN SHORTLY
c1vc0202 IT SAID IT EXPECTS TO MAKE A FURTHER ANNOUNCEMENT ON THIS SUBJECT EARLY THIS WEEK
c1vc0203 IT WOULDN'T ELABORATE
c1vc0204 MAYBE IT IS SUGGESTED THERE IS AN EASIER WAY
c1vc0205 WHAT ABOUT FIBERGLAS GONDOLAS
c1vc0206 AFTER ALL HE IS REMINDED SOMEBODY IN GERMANY HAS BUILT ONE
c1vc0207 BIG BOARD GAINERS OUTPACED LOSERS ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE TO FOUR THOUSAND SEVENTY TWO

c1vc0209 ON THE AMEX THE COUNT WAS THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO STOCKS UP AND TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN DOWN
c1vc020a AS AN ADOLESCENT FAYROUZ WHO IS NOW IN HER FIFTIES WENT TO THE LEBANESE CONSERVATORY
c1vc020b AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN SHE BECAME A MEMBER OF THE CHORUS AT THE LEBANESE RADIO STATION
c1vc020c <NOISE> BUT I DIDN'T LAST LONG BECAUSE THEY DISCOVERED QUICKLY I COULD BE A SOLOIST SHE SAYS
c1vc020d M. I. FIVE NOTED THAT IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF A FIRM OF TIMBER MERCHANTS LORD WILSON HAD MADE NINETEEN VISITS TO THE SOVIET UNION
c1vc020e A FORMER M. I. FIVE OFFICER JAMES MILLER TOLD THE SUNDAY TIMES THAT HIS CASE OFFICER HAS ASSURED HIM THAT LORD WILSON WAS A SOVIET AGENT
c1vc020f A GROUP OF M. I. FIVE ZEALOTS UNDERTOOK APPARENTLY ON THEIR OWN TO DRIVE HIM FROM OFFICE
c1vc020g THE GOVERNMENT FACES A KNOTTY SURPLUS PROBLEM
c1vc020h U. S. STORAGE BINS HOLD ROUGHLY AN EIGHT MONTH SUPPLY OF CORN AND A TEN MONTH SUPPLY OF WHEAT WHEN A THREE MONTH SUPPLY WOULD DO
c1vc020i MAKING MATTERS WORSE THE HARVEST RIPENING IN THE FIELDS PROMISES TO BE A MONSTER PORTENDING RECORD POST HARVEST SUPPLIES OF CORN AND A GLUT OF OTHER COMMODITIES
c1vc020j TO HELP CUT PRODUCTION THE U. S. IS PAYING FARMERS AN ANNUAL RENT FOR TEN YEARS TO IDLE EROSION PRONE CROP LAND UNDER A CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM
c1vc020k THE PHILIP MORRIS MAGAZINE ENJOYS BY FAR THE HIGHEST CIRCULATION OF ANY COMPANY MAGAZINE SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION COPIES
c1vc020l THE ONLY REQUIREMENT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE AN ADULT TO RECEIVE THE MAGAZINE SAYS MARY TAYLOR ASSOCIATE PUBLISHER
c1vc020m THAT'S NOT BECAUSE OF RACY ARTICLES BUT BECAUSE THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF TRYING TO SNATCH TWELVE AND THIRTEEN YEAR OLDS
c1vc020n PHILIP MORRIS IS EVEN CONSIDERING SELLING SPACE TO OUTSIDE ADVERTISERS IT ALREADY RAN AN AD FOR TIME MAGAZINE ON A TEST BASIS IN ITS WINTER NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN ISSUE
c1vc020o MARKET PROFESSIONALS SAY INVESTORS WILL FIND IT EASIER TO SORT OUT MUTUAL FUND PROSPECTUSES IF THEY FAMILIARIZE THEMSELVES WITH SOME BASIC SECTIONS AND TERMS
c1vc020p THEY SAY IT SHOULDN'T TAKE MORE THAN TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES TO PLUCK THE VITAL INFORMATION FROM THESE DOCUMENTS
c1vc020q THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS CAN PROVIDE A STARTING POINT AND PERHAPS HELP AN INVESTOR GET THROUGH PROSPECTUSES MORE EASILY
c1vc020r ALSO BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE CASH GUZZLERS CONSTANTLY NEEDING MONEY FOR CLINICAL TRIALS AND MANUFACTURING FACILITIES
c1vc020s THE CRITICAL FACTOR FOR MOST COMPANIES ISN'T HOW MUCH CASH THEY HAVE BUT HOW IT'S BEING SPENT MR. MACCALLUM SAYS
c1vc020t SOME COMPANIES THAT ARE SELLING AT CLOSE TO THEIR PER SHARE CASH VALUES ARE CORRECTLY BEING PERCEIVED IN A SKEPTICAL LIGHT HE CONTENDS
c1vc020u LATELY CHRISTMAS SHOPPERS OR AT LEAST INVESTORS APPEAR TO PREFER BOOKS AND CRAFTS
c1vc020v CRAFT HOUSE ROSE ONE AND THREE EIGHTHS YESTERDAY TO FOURTEEN
c1vc020w THE ISSUE STARTED THE YEAR AT FIVE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS AND WAS STILL AT ELEVEN AFTER LAST MONTH'S CRASH
c1vc020x AND BOOK PUBLISHERS ALSO MOVED AGAINST THE MARKET YESTERDAY
c1vc020y GEORGE BANTA ROSE ONE QUARTER TO FIFTEEN
c1vc020z KEMP'S CAMPAIGN TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE TONE
c1vc0210 IN ONE SURE SIGN OF A CANDIDACY IN TROUBLE HE LASHES OUT AT CRITICISM FROM A LIGHTLY REGARDED T. V. COMMENTATOR
c1vc0211 EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
c1vc0212 BUT HIS LONGTIME HOSTILITIES WITH DOLE LEAVE A SPOT ON A BUSH TICKET AS ABOUT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY
c1vc0213 WE'VE HAD A MAJOR RUN UP LAST WEEK PARTICULARLY FRIDAY NOTED MR. POLCE
c1vc0214 BUT HE ADDED THAT THE DOLLAR CAME UP TOO FAST THE MARKET'S BEEN CONSOLIDATING ITS GAINS
c1vc0215 MOREOVER MR. POLCE SAID THAT NOBODY REALLY WANTS TO BE TOO AGGRESSIVE TILL THE JAPANESE TRADE NUMBERS COME OUT
c1vc0216 STILL COMPANY INSIDERS SAID THE RESTRUCTURING WAS ENTIRELY MR. AKERS'S PLAN AND WASN'T FORCED ON HIM BY THE I. B. M. BOARD
c1vc0217 A DIRECTOR SAID THE BOARD LEARNED OF THE PLAN AT ITS MEETING LAST TUESDAY
c1vc0218 JOHN FOUND EVERYTHING WAS COMING ONTO HIS DESK AND HE HAD MORE THAN HE COULD COPE WITH ANOTHER DIRECTOR SAID
c1vc0219 HE WANTED AN ORGANIZATION WHICH RESOLVED MORE PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY GOT TO HIM

c1vc021e THE LATEST WEATHER FORECAST CALLS FOR FAIRLY GOOD MOISTURE IN MIDWEST FARMING STATES OVER THE NEXT SIX TO TEN DAYS
c1vc021f ANALYSTS SAID TRADERS ARE SHIFTING THEIR EMPHASIS AWAY FROM LAST YEAR'S CROP AND TO THIS YEAR'S
c1vc021g WITH THIS YEAR'S SMALL ACREAGE INCREASES WEATHER AND SPRING PLANTING CONDITIONS ARE MAJOR CONCERNS TO A MARKET THAT IS BEGINNING TO SHAKE OFF A HUGE SURPLUS

c1vc021i BURNUP AND SIMS HAS INTERESTS IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND SOFT DRINKS AMONGST OTHER THINGS
c1vc021j MR. POSNER BEGAN INVESTING IN IT IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND BY THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES CONTROLLED MORE THAN FORTY PERCENT OF ITS SHARES

c1vc021q FURTHER HE HAS GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE LARGE ETHNIC CHINESE COMMUNITY AND SERVES AS CHAIRMAN OF THE THAI CHINESE FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION
c1vc021r THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY'S BUSINESS ELITE MANY OF WHOM ARE ETHNIC CHINESE
c1vc021s ALTHOUGH SANDINISTA OFFICIALS SAY THE DOCUMENT WAS FAKED BY THE CONTRAS TWO OF THE AMBASSADORS HAVE SINCE RECEIVED NEW FOREIGN POSTINGS
c1vc021t AND NORMAN MIRANDA A MID RANKING FOREIGN MINISTRY REPRESENTATIVE WHO DEFECTED IN NOVEMBER IN GENEVA CONTENDS THAT IT IS GENUINE
c1vc021u THERE IS AN ATMOSPHERE OF DISTRUST THROUGHOUT THE MINISTRY SAYS MR. MIRANDA WHO NOW GIVES FRENCH LESSONS HERE
c1vc021v NOBODY KNOWS WHO WILL BE THE NEXT TO GO
c1vc021w OVERALL CONSUMER SPENDING HAS SLOWED SINCE LAST YEAR'S STOCK MARKET CRASH BUT IT'S STILL AT A LEVEL THAT WORRIES SOME ECONOMISTS
c1vc021x CONSUMER CREDIT SLOWED SHARPLY IN JULY REFLECTING SLUGGISH SALES
c1vc021y TOO MUCH SPENDING AT HOME COUPLED WITH HEAVY DEMAND FOR EXPORTS COULD OVERLOAD AN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THAT IS ALREADY RUNNING NEAR CAPACITY
c1vc021z PETER DAPUZZO HEAD OF RETAIL TRADING AT SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON ALSO LOOKS FOR A SHARP UPWARD MOVE IN STOCK PRICES GIVEN A FEW IFS
c1vc0220 ONE IS IF ITS INVESTORS DON'T GET SPOOKED AT THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE CRASH
c1vc0221 ANOTHER IS IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE EASES INTEREST RATES
c1vc0222 AND A THIRD IS IF GEORGE BUSH WINS THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
c1vc0223 THEY LIKE MANY DEALERS BLAME V. W.'S DECLINE ON MR. PHILLIPS AND HIS LOW PROFILE STYLE OF MANAGEMENT

c1vc0225 HIS DEFENDERS ALSO NOTED THAT MANY EUROPEAN AUTO MAKERS HAVE STRUGGLED IN THE U. S. RECENTLY BECAUSE OF THE DECLINING VALUE OF THE DOLLAR
c1vc0226 MR. PHILLIPS WAS UNAVAILABLE TO COMMENT ON HIS JOB CHANGE YESTERDAY COMPANY OFFICIALS SAID
c1vc0227 THE SUIT CHARGES THAT BURGER KING ONLY ALLOWS BLACK FRANCHISEES TO EXPAND ONE STORE AT A TIME WHILE WHITES ARE ALLOWED TO SIMULTANEOUSLY OPEN MULTIPLE FRANCHISES
c1vc0228 BURGER KING ALSO MAKES BLACKS WAIT THREE TO FOUR TIMES LONGER THAN WHITES FOR APPROVAL OF A NEW OR EXPANSION FRANCHISE THE SUIT SAYS
c1vc0229 THE FRANCHISEES FURTHER ALLEGE THAT BURGER KING FALSELY AND FRAUDULENTLY MISREPRESENTED THE SALES POTENTIAL OF THEIR STORES
c1vc022a MANY TRADERS ASSUME THE FINANCING WILL CONSIST OF THREE YEAR NOTES TEN YEAR NOTES AND THIRTY YEAR BONDS
c1vc022b BUT SOME TRADERS SAY THEY AREN'T SO SURE THERE WILL BE ANY THIRTY YEAR BONDS
