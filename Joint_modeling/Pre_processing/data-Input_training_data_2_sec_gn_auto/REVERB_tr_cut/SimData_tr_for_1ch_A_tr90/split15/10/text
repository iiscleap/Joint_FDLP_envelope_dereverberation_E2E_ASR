c1gc0224 THE FALL WAS LED BY BANK STOCKS
c1gc0225 OTHER INDUSTRIAL SECTORS HOWEVER RECOVERED FROM RECENT DECLINES
c1gc0226 BUT IT'S WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ALL ABOUT
c1gc0227 THE REAL QUESTION ON THE BALLOT IS SHOULD THE REAGAN YEARS CONTINUE BEYOND THE REAGAN YEARS
c1gc0228 BEYOND THE BUSH YEARS
c1gc0229 BEYOND EVEN THE QUAYLE YEARS
c1gc022a THE SUPREME COURT WILL DETERMINE THAT AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL DETERMINE THE COURT'S MAKEUP FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER GENERATION

c1hc020a THE S. E. C. SAYS ITS RULE PROHIBITS SHAREHOLDERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN A TENDER OFFER FROM MAKING ADDITIONAL PROFITS BY SIMULTANEOUSLY SELLING SHORT OTHER STOCK IN THE COMPANY
c1hc020b IN A SHORT SALE A HOLDER SELLS BORROWED STOCK THAT HE AGREES TO REPLACE LATER
c1hc020c IN EFFECT THE HOLDER IS BETTING THAT THE PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK WILL DROP ALLOWING HIM TO PROFIT BY REPLACING THE STOCK WITH CHEAPER STOCK
c1hc020d SUCH RESULTS ARE CAUSING SOME WALL STREET PROFESSIONALS TO TAKE THE JANUARY INDICATOR LESS SERIOUSLY THAN THEY USED TO
c1hc020e I'M PUTTING LESS EMPHASIS ON SOME OF THESE TRADITIONAL BAROMETERS SAYS EUGENE PERONI DIRECTOR OF TECHNICAL RESEARCH FOR JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT INCORPORATED IN PHILADELPHIA

c1hc020n MR. WYLIE SAID THE G. O. P. MEMBERS PREFERRED THE HOUSING BILL PASSED BY THE SENATE
c1hc020o THAT BILL WOULD PROVIDE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AUTHORIZATION LEVELS FOR TWO YEARS AND FEWER PROGRAM CHANGES
c1hc020p IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BY ITS SPONSORS AS A HOUSEKEEPING BILL DESIGNED TO GIVE LAWMAKERS MORE TIME TO DEBATE THRUST OF THE NATION'S HOUSING PROGRAMS
c1hc020q SECOND THERE WAS MR. KINNOCK HIMSELF
c1hc020r HIS STRATEGISTS AND POLL TAKERS HAVE LONG KNOWN THAT MOST BRITISH VOTERS HAVE ONLY A FUZZY IDEA OF WHAT KIND OF MAN HE IS
c1hc020s PART OF HIS PROBLEM WAS MRS. THATCHER WHOSE POWERFUL PERSONALITY HAS DOMINATED THE STAGE FOR ALMOST A DECADE

c1hc0217 WE SEE MANY OF THOSE WHO BOUGHT WEDNESDAY COMING INTO THE MARKET TO SELL A BROKER SAID YESTERDAY
c1hc0218 TRADERS SAID THERE FEW SELL ORDERS FROM INDIVIDUALS BUT THAT BUY ORDERS FROM CORPORATE INVESTORS HAD GROUND TO A HALT
c1hc0219 THEY PREDICTED THAT THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE SIZABLE SWINGS UNTIL THE MARKET FINDS ITS BALANCE
c1hc021a CERTAINLY FOREIGN COMPETITION AND A CHANGING WORLD ECONOMY HAVE EXACTED A HEAVY TOLL ON OUR NATION'S MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
c1hc021b HOWEVER MANY OF THESE INDUSTRIES HAVE SURVIVED AND ARE NOW AS TOUGH AND LEAN AS THEY'VE EVER BEEN
c1hc021c THE MANAGERS OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE LEARNED THROUGH HARD EXPERIENCE ABOUT EXACTLY WHICH INVESTMENTS PAY OFF
c1hc021d ART COLLECTORS AND DEALERS HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF LAST NIGHT
c1hc021e AFTER HIGH PRICES AND FRANTIC BIDDING AT ART AUCTIONS LAST SPRING ABOUT ONE IN FOUR WORKS DIDN'T SELL AT A CONTEMPORARY ART AUCTION AT CHRISTIE'S
c1hc021f BUT AT LEAST THE MARKET DIDN'T CRASH
c1hc021g THE HUGE GAP TO A LARGE EXTENT IS A PRICE PHENOMENON
c1hc021h THE DOLLAR'S FALL HAS PUSHED UP THE PRICE OF IMPORTS CAUSING THE DEFICIT TO SWELL EVEN AS THE VOLUME OF NON OIL IMPORTS HAS RECEDED
c1hc021i BUT BEFORE LONG NOW THESE HIGHER PRICES WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT IN THE MONTHLY MERCHANDISE TRADE DEFICIT AS WELL
c1hc021j EDGAR S. WOOLARD DU PONT'S PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER NURTURED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE VENTURE
c1hc021k HE SAYS DU PONT IS STILL VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT ITS PROSPECTS BUT HE ACKNOWLEDGES HURDLES THAT MUST BE OVERCOME

c1hc021u WITH POLITICAL DIVISIONS IN ISRAEL AND AN ADMINISTRATION NEARING THE END OF ITS TERM IN THE U. S. FEW PEOPLE HOLD OUT MUCH HOPE FOR RECENT PEACE INITIATIVES
c1hc021v THUS ALONG THE RIVER IMPATIENT RESIDENTS HAVE BEGUN THEIR OWN RAPPROCHEMENT
c1hc021w CRITICS ARGUE THAT HE MAY BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC THOUGH
c1hc021x AND MR. DUKAKIS IS CERTAIN TO FACE MORE PRESSURE ON THE QUESTION FROM VICE PRESIDENT BUSH WHO SUPPORTS BOTH THE M. X. AND MIDGETMAN
c1hc021y MOREOVER MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BEING CONSIDERED AS POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES FOR GOVERNOR DUKAKIS HAVE BACKED ONE OR THE OTHER MISSILE PLANS
c1hc021z THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL PENDING IN CONGRESS IS EXPECTED TO PUT OFF ANY DECISION UNTIL A NEW ADMINISTRATION TAKES OFFICE NEXT YEAR
c1hc0220 MR. ZEHNDER PLAYS DOWN THIS CRITICISM
c1hc0223 THE ADDITIONAL SHARES MAY HAVE BEEN BOUGHT IN THE OPEN MARKET OR IN PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS THE FILING SAID

c1hc022i THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF RECESSION LIKE DEVELOPMENTS IN THESE STATISTICS SAID NORMAN ROBERTSON CHIEF ECONOMIST AT MELLON BANK CORPORATION
c1hc022j AS A RESULT HE SAID IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THE FED IS GOING TO EASE AT THIS TIME
c1hc022k UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE FED WILL PROBABLY ADOPT A FAMILIAR WAIT AND SEE ATTITUDE
c1ic0201 BOSTON AND SIMILAR MARKETS ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE THOUGH
c1ic0202 GENERALLY ECONOMISTS PREDICT THAT HOME PRICES NATIONWIDE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WILL RISE AT THE MOST ONLY A FEW PERCENTAGE POINTS FASTER THAN INFLATION

c1jc021f THE PLOT IS A TRUE LIFE TALE OF M. C. A. ITSELF AND THE ENDING HAS YET TO BE PLAYED OUT
c1jc021g <NOISE> BUT THE REVELATIONS HAVE ALREADY RAISED EYEBROWS IN HOLLYWOOD WHERE M. C. A. IS CONSIDERED PART OF THE BEDROCK OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY
c1jc021h M. C. A. HAD TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE LAST YEAR OWNS UNIVERSAL STUDIOS AND IS A TELEVISION MUSIC AND REAL ESTATE GIANT
c1jc021i THE COMPANY HASN'T BEEN CHARGED WITH ANY WRONGDOING BUT RECENT PUBLICITY ABOUT ITS TANGLE OF BUSINESS DEALINGS THREATENS AT THE VERY LEAST TO SULLY ITS REPUTATION
c1jc021j MOST IMPORTANT IS THE ATTITUDE MR. LIM SAYS
c1jc021k C. E.'S ATTITUDE IS GOOD
c1jc021l WESTINGHOUSE'S ISN'T
c1jc021m ALTHOUGH WESTINGHOUSE HAS SUPPLIED SIX NUCLEAR PLANTS TO KOREA IT DIDN'T RELEASE THE TECHNICAL SKILLS TO US TO DO IT OURSELVES NEXT TIME
c1jc021n WE BELIEVE THAT C. E. WILL
c1jc021o THE LOWER VOLATILITY COULD BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW WHEN THE COURSE OF INTEREST RATES SEEMS ESPECIALLY CLOUDY
c1jc021p WHILE INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN DECLINING RECENTLY MANY ECONOMISTS EXPECT RATES TO RISE BY YEAR END
c1jc021q AFTER THAT HOWEVER THEY SAY RATES COULD FALL AGAIN PERHAPS SHARPLY AS ECONOMIC GROWTH SLOWS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
c1jc021r ALTHOUGH WEDNESDAY IS THE BIG DAY SOME OF THE HOOPLA IS CARRYING OVER TO THE WEEKEND
c1jc021s TRASH THE CRASH
c1jc021t CASH IN ON THE BASH WILL BE THE THEME OF A SATURDAY PARTY THROWN BY A NEW YORK TELEVISION EXECUTIVE PRODUCER
c1jc021u WEARING A TIE IS OPTIONAL THE INVITATION SAYS BUT IF YOU WEAR ONE IN THE RED TIE ONLY
c1jc021v THOSE EDITORS WHO HAVE PLUNGED IN ARE FINDING THAT AN ELECTRONIC OFFSHOOT CAN HELP THEM PUT OUT A MAGAZINE
c1jc021w BIX USERS HAVE SEEN THEIR ELECTRONIC MUSINGS FIND THEIR WAY INTO PRINT IN BYTE IN A SECTION CALLED BEST OF BIX
c1jc021x NOT LONG AGO BYTE EDITORS WANDERING THROUGH BIX WERE STRUCK BY INSIGHTFUL COMMENTS ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS FROM A SUBSCRIBER IN SAN DIEGO
c1jc021y TODAY THE SUBSCRIBER BROCK MEEKS IS A REGULAR BYTE CONTRIBUTOR ONE OF SEVERAL THE MAGAZINE HAS RECRUITED FROM BIX
c1jc021z THE RICHMOND VIRGINIA MEDIA CONCERN SAID SALES AND PROFITS FROM ITS NEWSPRINT OPERATIONS WERE AHEAD OF YEAR EARLIER LEVELS
c1jc0220 ITS CABLE SYSTEM CONTINUED TO GAIN SUBSCRIBERS NOW TOTALING MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND
c1jc0221 REVENUE PER SUBSCRIBER IS EXCEEDING FORECASTS MEDIA GENERAL SAID ADDING THAT ITS PLANS TO INCREASE RATES AN AVERAGE OF EIGHT PERCENT BEGINNING IN JANUARY
c1jc0222 MR. LEPPO WAS CHIEF MERCHANDISING OFFICER AND EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AT ALLIED FROM AUGUST NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN UNTIL LAST JULY
c1jc0223 HE AND MS. FORTUNE SAID MR. CAMPEAU ENCOURAGED THEM TO BID FOR ANN TAYLOR
c1jc0224 MS. FORTUNE HAS BEEN PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF ANN TAYLOR FOR THE PAST ONE AND ONE HALF YEARS
c1jc0225 IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE AUCTIONS ARE GOING IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN TOKYO SAID MR. PETRI OF MERRILL LYNCH
c1jc0226 NO ONE FIRM CAN DOMINATE THE AUCTION PROCESS THE WAY SALOMON USED TO
c1jc0227 THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE JAPANESE INFLUENCE
c1jc0228 THEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR NATIONAL UNION JOINED THE MARKET
c1jc0229 ITS POLICY FOR STATE JUDGES THE BIGGEST CLIENTS COSTS EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A ONE MILLION DOLLAR POLICY WITH NO DEDUCTIBLE
c1jc022a THE JUDGES ARE COVERED FOR ACTS ERRORS AND OMISSIONS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF PROFESSIONAL DUTIES MR. BOLEN SAYS
c1jc022b CONSUMERS MAY ALSO BE WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER AUTO MAKERS WILL CONTINUE THE GENEROUS INCENTIVES THEY USED ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY OVER THE PAST YEAR TO BUOY SALES
c1jc022c WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THE GOOD OLD BUY IN ADVANCE SYNDROME SAID JOHN QUALLS OF MICRO ECONOMICS LIMITED IN SAINT LOUIS
c1jc022d MR. QUALLS EXPECTS SALES TO SAG BADLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER CAUSING SUPPLIES OF UNSOLD VEHICLES TO RISE UNLESS AUTO MAKERS SHOW CONTINUED RESTRAINT IN PRODUCTION
c1jc022e MR. YEUTTER MEANWHILE SAID THE U. S. IS VIGOROUSLY OPPOSED TO THE E. C.'S CALL FOR A REBALANCING OF TARIFFS ON FARM PRODUCTS
c1jc022f IN EXCHANGE FOR ACCEPTING SOME TARIFF REDUCTIONS THE COMMUNITY WANTS TO BE ALLOWED TO IMPOSE TARIFFS ON PRODUCTS THAT CURRENTLY ENTER THE E. C. DUTY FREE
c1jc022g THESE INCLUDE MAJOR U. S. EXPORTS TO THE E. C. SUCH AS SOYBEANS AND CORN GLUTEN
c1jc022h AS HER LIFE GETS ENMESHED WITH ANDREW'S THESE TWO OLD PALS CARE MORE AND MORE FOR THEIR CORRESPONDENCE WITH EACH OTHER
c1jc022i UNFORTUNATELY IT CANNOT SAVE THEM FROM THE UNHAPPINESS OF THEIR OWN MISTAKES
c1jc022j IN LOVE LETTERS MR. GURNEY ILLUMINATES A PARADOXICAL HUMAN TRUTH LOVE CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE OR IT CAN MAKE NONE AT ALL
c1kc0201 ALARMED BY THE BURN THROUGHS THE F. A. A. ISSUED NEW RULES REQUIRING AIRLINES TO CONDUCT FREQUENT INSPECTIONS OF BURNER CANS
c1kc0202 THE AGENCY ALSO PROHIBITED THE WELDING OF CAN CRACKS LONGER THAN THREE INCHES
c1kc0203 BRITISH AIRWAYS INITIATED AN EVEN TOUGHER POLICY CRACKED CANS AREN'T WELDED THEY ARE REPLACED
c1kc0204 THE AIRLINE ALSO PIONEERED NEW INSPECTION TECHNIQUES TO DETECT CRACKS QUICKLY WITHOUT DISMANTLING THE ENGINE
c1kc0205 THE NEWSPAPER BUSINESS PROSPERS TODAY BECAUSE IT IS WELL MANAGED AND SERVES THE NEEDS OF ITS READERS AND ADVERTISERS
c1kc0206 CARRIERS SHARE ADEQUATELY IN THE PROFIT
c1kc0207 A CARRIER'S PROFIT IS TYPICALLY A PERCENTAGE OF THE NEWSSTAND OR HOME DELIVERY PRICE OF THE PAPER
c1kc0208 WHEN A NEWSPAPER INCREASES NEWSSTAND OR HOME DELIVERY RATES THE CARRIER'S PROFIT IS INCREASED PROPORTIONATELY
c1kc0209 THE TOP MAGNET AREAS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WERE HAWAII ALASKA DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA GEORGIA ARIZONA AND RHODE ISLAND
c1kc020a NEARLY THREE FOURTHS OF ALLIED'S HAWAII BUSINESS CONSISTED OF MOVES TO THE ISLANDS
c1kc020b ALLIED ALSO COUNTS STATES WHERE THERE'S A MARKED EXODUS
c1kc020c FOR THE THIRD YEAR IN A ROW NORTH DAKOTA HAD THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF ALLIED'S OUTBOUND MOVES
c1kc020d OTHER STATES WITH A HIGH SHARE OF OUTBOUND HOUSEHOLDS WERE IOWA WYOMING LOUISIANA AND WEST VIRGINIA
c1kc020e BY AND LARGE OPEC IS PREPARED TO SIT IT OUT SAID A SENIOR OPEC MINISTER WHO ASKED NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED
c1kc020f THERE MAY BE SOME WEAKER MEMBERS AMONG US BUT OPEC AS A WHOLE ISN'T OVERPRODUCING
c1kc020g THE PROBLEM IS SPECULATION BY TRADERS THAT VERGES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE
c1kc020h IN FACT GIVEN THE HIGHLY DEVELOPED U. S. TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE FEW IF ANY SHIPPERS ARE TRULY CAPTIVE TO RAILS
c1kc020i THE BEST CASE IS MADE BY ELECTRIC UTILITIES THAT HAVE POWER PLANTS SERVED BY COAL HAULING ROADS BUT BIG UTILITIES DON'T LACK BARGAINING POWER
c1kc020j FOR ONE THING THE STAGGERS ACT NOW ALLOWS LONG TERM CONTRACTS BETWEEN SHIPPERS AND RAILROADS
c1kc020k THAT INCREDIBLY WAS NOT ALLOWED UNDER THE OLD LAW BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD ONCE DECIDED THAT VOLUME DISCOUNTS TO BIG SHIPPERS WERE UNFAIR
c1kc020l IN DRAWING UP CONTRACTS THE RELEVANT FACT IS THAT BOTH THE RAILROAD AND THE UTILITY NEED EACH OTHER
c1kc020m SOME UTILITIES PARTICULARLY IN THE WEST HAVE SURPLUS CAPACITY MEANING THEY CAN SWITCH TO OTHER SOURCES IF HAULING COSTS AT A SINGLE PLANT RISE
c1kc020n IT IS DUE TO EDUCATION HE SAYS BLOWING SMOKE
c1kc020o WE GIVE YOUNG PEOPLE COMPOSITIONS TO WRITE PICTURES TO DRAW
c1kc020p PEOPLE HAVE COME TO SEE THAT IT IS NOT A GOOD THING TO DRINK TOO MUCH
c1kc020q THE MAY DECLINE WAS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED AT A ZERO POINT SIX PERCENT LOSS
c1kc020r IN APRIL RETAIL SALES ROSE ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT
c1kc020t TO DO THE JOB S. C. I. HAS ASSEMBLED WHAT ANALYSTS CALL A CRACK MANAGEMENT TEAM
c1kc020u PRESIDENT EUGENE SAPP RUNS THE COMPANY ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS AND HE DOES SO IN A NO FRILLS ATMOSPHERE
c1kc020v FOR EXAMPLE COMPANY CARS PLANES AND COUNTRY CLUB MEMBERSHIPS ARE TABOO
c1kc020w UNFORTUNATELY IT WON'T WORK
c1kc020x YOU NEED TO BORROW FROM ABROAD TO FINANCE YOUR NATIONAL BUDGET
c1kc020y WHY SHOULD ANYONE HERE OR ABROAD INVEST IN U. S. GOVERNMENT BONDS IF THE U. S. GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED TO A POLICY OF DEBASING ITS CURRENCY
c1kc020z YOU WILL BE FORCED TO INCREASE YOUR INTEREST RATES AS DO THE ISSUERS OF JUNK BONDS
c1kc0210 AND THEN YOU WILL HAVE A CRASH
c1kc0211 THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR THE NEW STRENGTH IN THE SWEDISH ECONOMY
c1kc0212 SOME OF THEM CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE ECONOMIC POLICIES PURSUED BY OUR GOVERNMENT WHICH IS LED BY THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY
c1kc0213 SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS ARE DUE TO THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY AND THE HALVING OF OIL PRICES
c1kc0214 THE IMPROVEMENT HAS GIVEN SWEDISH POLITICIANS TIME TO CONSIDER WHAT CHANGES ARE NEEDED IN A LONGER PERSPECTIVE TO ENSURE A CONTINUATION OF A FAVORABLE ECONOMIC SITUATION
c1kc0215 TECHNICALLY THE STOPGAP BILL WILL LEAVE THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF MONEY OVER THE WEEKEND
c1kc0216 BUT THAT SHOULD HAVE LITTLE PRACTICAL EFFECT SINCE MOST OPERATIONS WILL BE CLOSED DURING THAT TIME
c1kc0217 CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS HOPE HOWEVER IT WILL PRESSURE LAWMAKERS TO FINISH THEIR WORK BEFORE MONDAY
c1kc0218 FRED M. GIBBONS THIRTY EIGHT RESIGNED AS SOFTWARE PUBLISHING'S CHAIRMAN AND SUCCEEDS MS. BEDKE AS PRESIDENT
c1kc0219 HE ALSO WAS NAMED CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER A POST WHICH WASN'T FILLED WHEN MR. GIBBONS STEPPED DOWN FROM BOTH POSITIONS IN AUGUST
c1kc021a SINCE THEN THE TWO EXECUTIVES HAD BEEN SHARING DAY TO DAY OPERATIONAL MANAGEMENT MR. GIBBONS SAID
c1kc021b HOWEVER SUCH AN AGREEMENT MAY YET OCCUR
c1kc021c THERE'S A LOT BREWING HERE SAID ONE SOURCE CLOSE TO APPLE
c1kc021d THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST OF SEVERAL RELATED ANNOUNCEMENTS AND UNDERTAKINGS
c1kc021e THE SOURCE SAID TECHNICAL AGREEMENTS ARE EASIER TO HAMMER OUT THAN MARKETING AGREEMENTS
c1kc021f ADVANCING ISSUES AND DECLINERS WERE NECK AND NECK YESTERDAY BUT THE HEAVIEST TRADING WAS AMONG THE ISSUES WITH RISING PRICES
c1kc021g SOME FIFTY POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS AT ADVANCING PRICES COMPARED WITH THIRTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION THAT TRADED AT LOWER PRICES
c1kc021h IN ALL A MODERATE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION SHARES TRADED ON NASDAQ YESTERDAY
c1kc021i TODAY'S GAMES RELY ON COMPUTER GENERATED IMAGES
c1kc021j AS COMPUTER CHIPS HAVE BECOME MORE POWERFUL THE IMAGES HAVE BECOME MORE COMPLICATED AND VIVID BUT STILL AREN'T REALISTIC
c1kc021k UNDER DEVELOPMENT HOWEVER ARE GAMES IN WHICH THE PLAYERS INTERACT WITH VIDEOTAPE SCENES
c1kc021l AS FOR THE STICKERS FEW FORD DRIVERS EVEN APPLIED THEM
c1kc021m ONLY ABOUT SEVEN PERCENT DID ACCORDING TO A SPOT CHECK BY THE CENTER FOR AUTO SAFETY
c1kc021n AND FORD NEVER REACHED MORE THAN TWO MILLION OWNERS AT ALL
c1kc021o MANY DEBT HOLDERS SHRUGGED OFF THE F. D. I. C.'S THREAT TO ALLOW FIRST CITY'S BANKS TO FAIL
c1kc021p AT FIRST F. D. I. C. OFFICIALS SUGGESTED THAT WOULD LEAVE CREDITORS EMPTY HANDED
c1kc021q BUT THAT CAME TO LOOK UNLIKELY AS FIRST CITY HAD SOME HEALTHY BANKS AND REGULATORS CAN CLOSE ONLY INSOLVENT BANKS
c1kc021r IF THEY HAD TAKEN OVER THE SICK BANKS CREDITORS MANY OF THEM ARBITRAGERS WHO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PROFIT COULD HAVE PURSUED CLAIMS AGAINST THE SOLVENT ONES
c1kc021s A SIMILAR VIEW IS HELD BY GRETA E. MARSHALL INVESTMENT MANAGER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM WHICH MANAGES ABOUT FORTY FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS
c1kc021t I STILL SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT INFLATION IS PICKING UP SUBSTANTIALLY SHE SAYS
c1kc021u THE ECONOMY DOESN'T LOOK SO STRONG THAT IT WILL REKINDLE INFLATION SO I WOULD VIEW ANY FURTHER DROP IN BOND PRICES AS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY
c1kc021v CRITICS ARGUE THAT HE MAY BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC THOUGH
c1kc021w AND MR. DUKAKIS IS CERTAIN TO FACE MORE PRESSURE ON THE QUESTION FROM VICE PRESIDENT BUSH WHO SUPPORTS BOTH THE M. X. AND MIDGETMAN
c1kc021x MOREOVER MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BEING CONSIDERED AS POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES FOR GOVERNOR DUKAKIS HAVE BACKED ONE OR THE OTHER MISSILE PLANS
c1kc021y THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL PENDING IN CONGRESS IS EXPECTED TO PUT OFF ANY DECISION UNTIL A NEW ADMINISTRATION TAKES OFFICE NEXT YEAR
c1kc021z APOLLO IS THE SECOND LARGEST COMPUTER RESERVATIONS SYSTEM IN THE U. S. BEHIND SABRE
c1kc0220 IN MAY UNITED AGREED TO SELL A HALF INTEREST IN APOLLO TO FOUR EUROPEAN AIRLINES AND U. S. AIR GROUP INCORPORATED FOR NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
c1kc0221 THE TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY REVIEWING THAT TRANSACTION
c1kc0222 BUT THERE IS ALWAYS THE RISK THAT REVIVING A CLASSIC SLOGAN OR SPOKESMAN WILL BACKFIRE AND CREATE AN OLD FASHIONED IMAGE FOR A BRAND
c1kc0223 TO GUARD AGAINST THAT MARKETEERS TEND TO GIVE THEIR RECYCLED ADS A CONTEMPORARY TWIST
c1kc0224 THE CAPTAIN RAID OF NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT FOR EXAMPLE HAS RIPPLING MUSCLES AND A FUTURISTIC LOOK
c1kc0225 AND A WOMAN IN ONE OF THE NEW NESTEA SPOTS DOESN'T JUST TUMBLE INTO A SWIMMING POOL SHE FALLS ONTO AN EXERCISE MAT THAT TURNS INTO A POOL
c1kc0226 THAT SAID MR. QUAYLE HAS CLEARLY SHOWN HE CAN LEARN FAST
c1kc0227 IN TWELVE YEARS IN CONGRESS AND ESPECIALLY FROM HIS ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE POST IN THE SENATE MR. QUAYLE HAS MADE HIMSELF AN INTELLIGENT ADVOCATE OF U. S. DEFENSE
c1kc0228 HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE DETAILS OF STRATEGY HAS LED HIM TO SUPPORT SUCH VALUABLE BUT ARCANE HIGH TECHNOLOGY WEAPONS AS CONVENTIONALLY ARMED CRUISE MISSILES
c1kc0229 THESE HAVE POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE NATO DETERRENCE EVEN AS THEY REDUCE DEFENSE COSTS
c1kc022a OVERALL CONSUMER SPENDING HAS SLOWED SINCE LAST YEAR'S STOCK MARKET CRASH BUT IT'S STILL AT A LEVEL THAT WORRIES SOME ECONOMISTS
c1kc022b CONSUMER CREDIT SLOWED SHARPLY IN JULY REFLECTING SLUGGISH SALES
c1kc022c TOO MUCH SPENDING AT HOME COUPLED WITH HEAVY DEMAND FOR EXPORTS COULD OVERLOAD AN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THAT IS ALREADY RUNNING NEAR CAPACITY
c1kc022d HITLER AND STALIN WERE FRIENDS SAYS AN OLD MAN TURNING IN HIS SEAT TO FACE MR. SEMIONENKOV
c1kc022e ANOTHER WALKS TO THE BACK OF THE BUS
c1kc022f THE POLISH PEOPLE KNEW IT LONG AGO
c1kc022g IT WAS THE RUSSIANS
c1kc022h ONE STUMBLING BOCK TO INCREASED COMPETITION IS THE VERTICAL INTEGRATION AND CROSS OWNERSHIP IN THE INDUSTRY
c1kc022i CABLE SYSTEMS OFTEN HAVE DEMANDED A STAKE IN THE CHANNELS THEY TRANSMIT
c1kc022j AN ENTREPRENEUR IS RELUCTANT TO START AN ALTERNATIVE CABLE SYSTEM IF HE KNOWS THAT HE WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GAIN ACCESS TO PROGRAMMING
c1kc022k QUITE POSSIBLY SOME OF THE ANTITRUST ASPECTS OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS DESERVE A LOOK SO IT CAN BE DETERMINED WHETHER THEY ACT TO FURTHER INHIBIT COMPETITION IN THE INDUSTRY
c1lc0201 DIVERSIFIED ENERGIES INCORPORATED COMPLETED THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF SENIOR NOTES
c1lc0202 THE ENERGY SERVICES CONCERN SAID THE NOTES WERE PLACED WITH A GROUP OF INSURANCE COMPANIES LED BY AETNA LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY A UNIT OF AETNA LIFE AND CASUALTY COMPANY
c1lc0203 THE COMPANY BASED IN MINNEAPOLIS SAID PROCEEDS WILL BE USED TO TO RETIRE REVOLVING BANK CREDIT BORROWINGS OF SEVERAL OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND FOR WORKING CAPITAL
c1lc0204 THE PLACEMENT WAS MANAGED BY KIDDER PEABODY AND COMPANY
c1lc0205 THE TRANSACTION IS SO RISKY THAT PRATT AND WHITNEY A UNIT OF UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION IN EFFECT DROPPED OUT OF THE COMPETITION TO SUPPLY ENGINES FOR THE PLANES
c1lc0206 AS A RESULT GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY IS EXPECTED TO WIN THE ORDER FOR ALL THE ENGINES
c1lc0207 THE ENGINE ORDERS USUALLY ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL OR IN THIS CASE NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
c1lc0208 ONE PROBLEM WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNPOPULAR NEW W. FOUR FORM IS THAT THE I. R. S. FAILED TO TEST IT ADEQUATELY
c1lc0209 IN FACT THE FORM WASN'T SHOWN TO THE PUBLIC AT ALL
c1lc020a IT WAS PRESENTED ONLY TO I. R. S. EMPLOYEES IN TWO OF THE AGENCY'S SERVICE CENTERS
c1lc020b OFFICIALS SUGGEST THAT THESE CLERICAL NON TECHNICAL WORKERS REALLY AREN'T MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC
c1lc020c <NOISE> STILL MR. GIBBS CONCEDES THAT THE AGENCY PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE SOUGHT A WIDER VIEW
c1lc020d JUST WHAT SHUWA HAS IN MIND ISN'T CLEAR
c1lc020e A SPOKESMAN IN THE U. S. SAYS THE IDEA IS TO CREATE A CLEARINGHOUSE FOR THE SALES OF U. S. PROPERTIES BOTH SHUWA'S AND THOSE OWNED BY OTHERS
c1lc020f SHUWA SAYS IT ISN'T AIMING TO SELL TO INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS BUT TO INSTITUTIONS AND LARGE INVESTORS
c1lc020g STILL THE SALES OFFICE IS UNUSUAL FOR INSTITUTIONAL BUSINESS MOREOVER IT WILL BE ON THE GINZA AN ADDRESS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH RETAIL SHOPPING
c1lc020h ME AND THE GUY I WAS WITH WERE FISHING ALONG SOME WEEDS NOT GETTING MUCH OF ANYTHING COOK RECALLS
c1lc020i I HOOKED A BIG ONE AND IT GOT AWAY
c1lc020j I THOUGHT UH OH THAT'S IT FOR ME TODAY
c1lc020l JUST LUCKY I GUESS
c1lc020m AT ONE STAGE EARLY YESTERDAY BEFORE THE DOLLAR HAD RECOVERED THE LATEST THIRTY YEAR TREASURY BOND'S YIELD SURGED TO NEARLY EIGHT AND SEVEN EIGHTHS PERCENT
c1lc020n IT LATER FELL TO EIGHT POINT SIX FOUR PERCENT FROM EIGHT POINT SEVEN PERCENT FRIDAY
c1lc020o AS RECENTLY AS MARCH TWENTY SIXTH THIS ISSUE YIELDED ONLY SEVEN POINT FIVE FIVE PERCENT
c1lc020p PRECIOUS METAL PRICES ALSO STAGED A BIG REVERSAL WITH GOLD PRICES FIRST SOARING THROUGH MIDMORNING AND THEN LATER PLUNGING
c1lc020q THEN THERE ARE UTILITY STOCKS
c1lc020r THE NASDAQ UTILITY INDEX JUMPED EIGHTEEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER WHILE INDEXES OF LISTED UTILITY STOCKS ROSE BARELY THREE PERCENT
c1lc020s BUT IN FACT MOST OF THE FIFTY FIVE ELECTRIC GAS AND WATER UTILITY STOCKS ON NASDAQ PERFORMED MUCH LIKE THEIR COUNTERPARTS ON THE MAJOR EXCHANGES
c1lc020t IT IS A MISSION THAT REMAINS RELEVANT IN THE POST SEGREGATION ERA
c1lc020u MANY CURRENT MOREHOUSE STUDENTS WERE OFFERED SCHOLARSHIPS BY PREDOMINANTLY WHITE SCHOOLS BUT CAME HERE INSTEAD
c1lc020v FOR EXAMPLE ARCHIE RICH A DETROIT PAROCHIAL SCHOOL GRADUATE TURNED DOWN A DIVING SCHOLARSHIP FROM MICHIGAN'S OAKLAND UNIVERSITY IN FAVOR OF MOREHOUSE
c1lc020w I'VE ALWAYS FELT A STRONG RESPONSIBILITY TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY HE SAYS
c1lc020x BUT MEDIATION ISN'T NECESSARILY THE FARMER'S SAVIOR
c1lc020y RECENTLY A PRIVATE BANK STRUCK A HARD BARGAIN WITH A FARMER WHO WAS UNABLE TO MAKE HIS DEBT PAYMENTS
c1lc020z THE FARMER DEEDED BACK HIS FARM TO THE BANK AND KEPT HIS HOUSE AND FOUR ACRES SO HE COULD KEEP A FEW CALVES OR PIGS AND RAISE A GARDEN
c1lc0210 LAST WEEK SALOMON BROTHERS INCORPORATED LAUNCHED ITS SALOMON RUSSELL GLOBAL EQUITY INDEX TRACKING THREE POINT FIVE SIX FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF EQUITIES WORLD WIDE
c1lc0211 THREE SIMILAR MEASURES ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE
c1lc0212 LASZLO BIRINYI JUNIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR SALOMON'S EQUITY MARKET ANALYSIS GROUP SAYS WE'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE RELIABLE CONSISTENT INFORMATION ON GLOBAL SECURITIES
c1lc0213 AND YET THIS HAPLESS FELLOW HAD THE GUTS TO SUE HIS FATHER AND THE AMBITION TO GRAB FOR CONTROL OF THE CORPORATION THAT BEARS HIS NAME
c1lc0214 HE IS MOST ELUSIVE
c1lc0215 IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO HE TOURED NEW YORK'S TAKEOVER HOUSES BLITHELY CHATTING ABOUT GETTY'S PROBLEMS
c1lc0216 WAS HE NAIVELY SEEKING ADVICE OR WAS HE SUBTLY SHOWING THAT HE WAS WILLING TO GO OUTSIDE THE FIRM FOR ALLIES TO OUST THE CURRENT MANAGEMENT
c1lc0217 PERHAPS THE MOST POPULAR DIVERSIONARY TACTIC IS A DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN IN WHICH THE EMPLOYER PUTS MONEY INTO A SEPARATE ACCOUNT FOR THE EMPLOYEE
c1lc0218 COMPARED WITH QUALIFIED PENSION PLANS THESE TRUSTS HAVE SOME DISADVANTAGES
c1lc0219 AN EMPLOYER CAN'T DEDUCT CONTRIBUTIONS TO SUCH A TRUST FROM CORPORATE TAXES AND THE FUNDS AREN'T PROTECTED IF THE COMPANY'S CREDITORS COME LOOKING FOR ASSETS TO ATTACH
c1lc021a OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST WASTE MANAGEMENT'S BOARD MEETS
c1lc021b CHEMLAWN IS DISCUSSED ONLY BRIEFLY AND IS RULED OUT AS A TAKEOVER TARGET BY MR. BUNTROCK
c1lc021c OFFICIALS AT THE COMPANY SAY CHEMLAWN DIDN'T BELONG ON THE AGENDA UNDER PENDING ACQUISITIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE
c1lc021d THE JAPANESE FIRMS INCLUDING OURSELVES HAVE BEEN GOOD MEMBERS OF THE PRIMARY DEALER COMMUNITY SAID TOSHIO MORI CHAIRMAN OF NIKKO'S U. S. UNIT
c1lc021e WE ARE NOT A DISTURBING FORCE IN THIS MARKET AND I DON'T SEE ANY ADVANTAGE IN KICKING THREE JAPANESE FIRMS OUT FROM BEING PRIMARY DEALERS
c1lc021f WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE FOR U. S. MARKETS AND THE U. S. ECONOMY
c1lc021g MR. MAUCHER SAID HE HAD DISCUSSED SOME FORM OF STRATEGIC COOPERATION WITH ROWNTREE'S MR. DIXON FOR THE PAST YEAR
c1lc021h MR. MAUCHER DECLINED TO ELABORATE EXCEPT TO SAY HIS PROPOSALS FELL SHORT OF A TAKEOVER BID
c1lc021i HE SAID HE UNSUCCESSFULLY RAISED THE POSSIBILITY OF COOPERATION AGAIN WITH MR. DIXON AFTER THE JACOBS SUCHARD RAID TWO WEEKS AGO
c1lc021j AT THAT POINT NESTLE DECIDED TO LAUNCH ITS BID MR. MAUCHER SAID
c1lc021k JAMES MAHONEY MR. CARSON'S SPOKESMAN SAYS THE SPLIT WITH MR. BUSHKIN OCCURRED AFTER MR. CARSON DECIDED TO SELL HIS TELEVISION PRODUCTION BUSINESS
c1lc021l THERE AREN'T ANY FINANCIAL IRREGULARITIES HE SAYS
c1lc021m THEY DIFFERED ON THE MANNER IN WHICH HIS COMPANIES WERE BEING SOLD
c1lc021n MR. CARSON IS SAID TO HAVE DECIDED TO SELL CARSON PRODUCTIONS PIECEMEAL INSTEAD OF AS A GOING CONCERN
c1lc021p CHAMPION SAID ABOUT TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED WORKERS STRUCK ITS FIVE LUMBER AND PLYWOOD PLANTS IN THE REGION OVER THE WEEKEND
c1lc021q STAMFORD CONNECTICUT BASED CHAMPION HAS FOURTEEN SUCH PLANTS NATIONWIDE THE SPOKESMAN SAID
c1lc021r THE INTERNATIONAL WOODWORKERS OF AMERICA AND THE WESTERN COUNCIL OF INDUSTRIAL WORKERS UNION STRUCK TWO CHAMPION MILLS WHERE THE CONTRACT RECENTLY EXPIRED ACCORDING TO A CHAMPION SPOKESMAN
c1lc021s PICKET LINES ERECTED BY THOSE STRIKERS QUICKLY CLOSED THE OTHERS WHERE CONTRACTS EITHER HAVE EXPIRED OR WILL EXPIRE BY JULY THIRTY FIRST HE ADDED
c1lc021t ARTHUR YOUNG LATE LAST MONTH FIRED THE PARTNERS AND SUED TO ENJOIN THEM FROM STEALING CONSULTING CLIENTS AND LURING AWAY PERSONNEL
c1lc021u THE PARTNERS FORMED A NEW CONSULTING FIRM TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS INCORPORATED BASED IN CHICAGO WHICH HAS OFFERED TO BUY ARTHUR YOUNG'S CONSULTING PRACTICE FOR FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS
c1lc021v ARTHUR YOUNG DECLINED THE OFFER
c1lc021w FOR THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THIRD QUARTER THE MAGAZINE GROUP HAD PRETAX EARNINGS OF SIX POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS ON REVENUE OF FIFTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
c1lc021x THE EXPECTED EARNINGS DROP REFLECTS ONE FEWER ISSUE IN THE QUARTER OF FAMILY CIRCLE
c1lc021y ALSO THE COMPANY CITED DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR THREE NEW MAGAZINES
c1lc021z IN THE POSITION I'M IN I COULD RAISE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY IN TEN DAYS MORE THAN I WOULD NEED HE SAYS
c1lc0220 BUT I WON'T DO IT
c1lc0221 I WOULD BE DEFEATED BEFORE I WOULD ACCEPT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS
c1lc0222 BUT FREEDOM ISN'T AN ACCIDENT
c1lc0223 IT IS THE RESULT OF PAINSTAKING WORK TO MAINTAIN THE STRUCTURE OF LIBERTY AGAINST INEVITABLE EROSION AT THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNMENT
c1lc0224 I THOUGHT THAT MY WORK FOR THE A. C. L. U. WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF MAINTAINING FREEDOM FOR EVERYONE
c1lc0225 I NOW CONFESS MY ERROR AND EMBRACE LEADER BUSH'S PERCEPTION THAT THE A. C. L. U. IS A POLITICALLY SUSPECT LIBERAL CONSPIRACY
c1lc0226 RYAN SEEMED FREE FROM DRUGS AND MORE LIKE HIS OLD SELF
c1lc0227 HE CLOSELY FOLLOWED THE NEWS AND DISCUSSED THE SUPREME COURT NOMINATION OF ROBERT BORK WITH MORE FACTS THAN EVEN HIS FATHER THE JOURNALIST WAS UP ON
c1lc0228 CORRECTING ME HE WOULD QUIP I THINK I KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS THAN YOU DO
c1lc0229 DURING THAT CAMPAIGN AS IN EARLIER ONES A FEW LOW AND MIDDLE RANKING OFFICIALS WERE ARRESTED OR DISMISSED
c1lc022a BUT NO LEADING CADRES OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS WERE PUNISHED FUELING CYNICISM AMONG THE MASSES
c1lc022b AND THE CORRUPTION PROBLEM SEEMED ONLY TO GET WORSE
c1lc022c THE APPOINTMENT CONTINUED TO LANGUISH AND ON JUNE FIRST DOCTOR SULLIVAN CALLED MR. FULTON AND SUGGESTED THAT HE WITHDRAW HIS NAME FROM CONSIDERATION
c1lc022d DOCTOR SULLIVAN HAD CONCLUDED THAT EVEN IF HE PUSHED THE FULTON NOMINATION THROUGH THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE SENATE THE PRICE OF VICTORY WOULD BE TOO HIGH
c1lc022e HE WOULD HAVE INCURRED THE WRATH OF THE RIGHT TO LIFE MOVEMENT AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ENEMY MR. FULTON SAYS
c1lc022f THE FED REPORT GAVE NO HINT THAT MAKERS OF CAPITAL EQUIPMENT EXPECT DEMAND FOR THEIR WARES TO FALL OFF
c1lc022g PRODUCTION OF BUSINESS EQUIPMENT THOUGH REDUCED BY THE DROP IN AUTO AND TRUCK PRODUCTION GREW ZERO POINT TWO PERCENT IN JULY AFTER REMAINING FLAT IN JUNE
c1lc022h THE FED ATTRIBUTED THE INCREASE TO STEPPED UP PRODUCTION OF COMMERCIAL AND FACTORY EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS AIRCRAFT
c1lc022i OUTPUT OF INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS ALSO REBOUNDED IN JULY AFTER DROPPING FOR TWO MONTHS
c1mc0201 RICHARD MACDONALD AN ANALYST AT FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION SAID THE RESULTS WERE IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS
c1mc0202 THE IMPRESSIVE THING IS THE IMPROVEMENTS THEY'VE MADE IN COST SAVINGS HE ADDED
c1mc0203 FOR EXAMPLE TIME RECENTLY SAID IT WOULD DO AWAY WITH ITS MAGAZINE DEVELOPMENT GROUP A MOVE MR. MACDONALD SAID COULD SHAVE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL COSTS
c1mc0204 WE HAD TO SCOUR THE EARTH TO ACHIEVE THAT SETTLEMENT MR. LIEBMANN SAID
