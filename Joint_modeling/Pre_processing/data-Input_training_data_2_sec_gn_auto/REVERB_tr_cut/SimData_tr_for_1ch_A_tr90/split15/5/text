c0oc0215 IT ISN'T JUST THROWING TOGETHER A STRING OF NAMES AND SAYING THEY SIPPED CHAMPAGNE ATE CAVIAR AND WORE BILL BLASS THE COLUMNIST SAYS
c0oc0216 FACTS ARE IMPORTANT
c0oc0217 IF YOU SAY SOMEONE IS WEARING A RED TIE THEN HE SHOULD BE WEARING A RED TIE

c0oc021k WHILE INFLATION FEARS ABOUND INFLATION ITSELF IS HARD TO ACTUALLY PIN DOWN SHE SAID
c0oc021l THIS CREATES THE WORRY THAT IF INTEREST RATES ARE RAISED IN ORDER TO COMBAT INFLATION THE FRAGILITY OF THE ECONOMY COULD BRING ABOUT A RECESSION
c0oc021m BUT IT WAS BECOMING APPARENT TO EVERYONE THAT THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT RECESSION WAS NOT TO BE
c0oc021n THE FED FIRST PULLED OUT SOME OF THE BASE THAT IT HAD PUMPED IN DURING JANUARY BUT THEN IT WAS OFF TO THE RACES AGAIN
c0oc021o NOW THERE IS A WIDESPREAD FEAR THAT WE MAY BE HEADING INTO AN INFLATIONARY BOOM AND MR. GREENSPAN SAYS THE FED IS TIGHTENING UP
c0oc021p IT'S TRUE THAT THE AGENCY HAS PERMITTED A RISE IN THE FED FUNDS RATE THE FEE CHARGED ON RESERVES BANKS LEND TO ONE ANOTHER
c0oc021q BUT SO FAR THERE IS NO SIGN THAT IT IS SLOWING THE GROWTH OF MONEY
c0oc021r THE DECISION TO INTERRUPT THE OLYMPIC COVERAGE COULD MEAN A POTENTIAL ADVERTISING REVENUE LOSS OF EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS ACCORDING TO MICHAEL GARTNER PRESIDENT OF N. B. C. NEWS

c0oc0222 THIS YEAR THE SOVIETS HAVE MOVED COMMERCIAL SALES TO THE FRONT BURNER
c0oc0223 THE EXPORT ARM OF THE SOVIET MINISTRY OF AVIATION INDUSTRY HOPES TO DOUBLE ITS REVENUE BY THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES
c0oc0224 BUT SUCH A SHIFT WOULD BRING MAJOR UPHEAVALS TO THE SOVIET SYSTEM
c0oc0225 ORDERS FOR MILITARY AIRCRAFT HAVE FALLEN TWENTY PERCENT IN THE PAST TWO YEARS ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES
c0oc0226 AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES PRESTIGIOUS MILITARY DESIGN BUREAUS IN THE SOVIET UNION ARE DEVOTING SUBSTANTIAL MANPOWER TO CIVILIAN PROJECTS
c0oc0227 IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE POLITICAL SETTLEMENT ENVISAGED BY THE NON COMMUNISTS SEEMED PLAUSIBLE
c0oc0228 SOVIET LEADER MIKHAIL GORBACHEV WAS A MAJOR REASON
c0oc0229 MR. GORBACHEV SAW THE EXPANSIONIST AMBITIONS OF HIS PREDECESSORS STYMIED BY THE RESOLUTE CONTAINMENT POLICY OF BOTH CHINA AND THE PRO WESTERN ASEAN POWERS
c0oc022a SUPPORT FOR THE VIETNAMESE OCCUPATION OF CAMBODIA COST THE SOVIET UNION ECONOMICALLY AND DIPLOMATICALLY
c0oc022b SO THE SOVIETS TRYING TO ELIMINATE THE MILITARY QUAGMIRE IN CAMBODIA PERSUADED HANOI'S LEADERS TO NEGOTIATE A MILITARY WITHDRAWAL FROM CAMBODIA
c0oc022c SOME OF THAT CASH HAS BEEN USED FOR BONUS PAYMENTS
c0oc022d WAGES AND BONUSES ROSE NINETEEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST HALF A RATE THAT FAR OUTPACED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EXERTED UPWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES
c0oc022e CHINA'S ECONOMY GREW AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS ROUGHLY HALF THE AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE IN THE PAST DECADE

c0pc0208 MAJOR BANKS THAT ONCE WERE EAGER TO DO BUSINESS NOW AREN'T
c0pc0209 TO RAISE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR INSTANCE THE STOCK OF SOME SUBSIDIARIES HAS BEEN PLEDGED TO BANKS
c0pc020a BUT IF TEXACO SPENDS THAT MONEY BANK LOANS AUTOMATICALLY WILL BE PLACED ON SOME TEXACO ASSETS SAYS RICHARD BRINKMAN CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
c0pc020b HAD THAT HAPPENED THE FAILED BANKS WOULD HAVE TO BE TURNED OVER TO THE F. D. I. C. FOR DISPOSITION

c0pc020p MR. CAO HASN'T LOOKED BACK
c0pc020q HE MAKES TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A YEAR PRODUCING HIS BUG ART ABOUT EIGHT TIMES THE AVERAGE CHINESE INCOME

c0pc020s SOME CLOSE MOUTHED FRENCH COMPANIES REMIND MR. COATS FOR INSTANCE OF HOW BRITAIN WAS FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS AGO

c0pc021e WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE HE SAID
c0pc021f HIS LARGER FUNDS WHICH CAN INCLUDE U. S. STOCKS DIDN'T FARE AS WELL
c0pc021g THE MARKETS ARE BECOMING SO INTERNATIONAL
c0pc021h IT'S ONLY NATURAL THAT INSIDER TRADING IS NO LONGER JUST AMERICA'S PROBLEM OR JAPAN'S PROBLEM
c0pc021i WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT FROM AN INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE SAYS HIROSHI KURIHARA A MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE JAPAN SECURITIES DEALERS ASSOCIATION
c0pc021j T. P. A. REDUCED THE NUMBER OF PATIENT DEATHS BY FIFTY ONE PERCENT IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS AFTER HEART ATTACK
c0pc021k OF THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY PATIENTS WHO WERE GIVEN T. P. A. TWO POINT EIGHT PERCENT DIED IN THAT PERIOD
c0pc021l OF THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY WHO RECEIVED THE PLACEBO FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT DIED
c0pc021m TEXAS OF COURSE IS WHERE THE MOST TROUBLE IS TO BE FOUND
c0pc021n LENDERS THERE LIKE TO BLAME THE SO CALLED OIL PATCH RECESSION
c0pc021o BUT THE PROBLEM IN FACT IS BAD BANKING IN A FEW CASES EVEN CORRUPT BANKING
c0pc021q WORTH AREA FOR EXAMPLE HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING THAT LEGITIMATELY COULD BE CALLED A RECESSION
c0pc021r THE MAIN REASON SO MANY LENDERS ARE IN TROUBLE IS AN OLD FASHIONED FAILING AMONG BANKERS A WEAKNESS FOR REAL ESTATE SPECULATION

c0qc020h HE SAID THE WHITE HOUSE WAS PLEASED THAT THE REPORT HAD BEEN RELEASED BECAUSE MR. REAGAN WANTS TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED
c0qc020i A KEY TO THE RESPONSE OF THE OTHER MAJOR AMERICAN LENDERS WILL BE TODAY'S REACTION BY THE FINANCIAL MARKETS TO CITICORP'S MOVE
c0qc020j IF THE MARKETS REACT FAVORABLY ON THE GROUND THAT UNCERTAINTY HAS BEEN REDUCED OTHER BANKS WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO ESTABLISH HIGHER RESERVES

c0rc0229 THUS MR. PEROT PUT INTO PLAY A CONTRACT THAT E. D. S. HAS HELD EXCLUSIVELY SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN
c0rc022a THE CONTRACT EXPIRES NEXT YEAR
c0rc022b SINCE MONDAY'S OPENING BELL N. C. N. B. SHARES HAVE JUMPED FOUR AND THREE EIGHTHS POINTS CLOSING AT TWENTY SEVEN AND SEVEN EIGHTHS YESTERDAY
c0rc022c MANY ANALYSTS PREDICT THE STOCK COULD GO HIGHER SOON PERHAPS CROSSING THE THIRTY DOLLAR A SHARE BARRIER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A YEAR
c0rc022d LONG TERM BULLS PREDICT N. C. N. B.'S PRICE COULD EASILY DOUBLE AND SOME SAY TRIPLE
c0rc022e BUT MR. PETERSON SAYS THERE STILL IS AN IMAGE PROBLEM
c0rc022f IF WE HAVEN'T WORKED WITH A COMPANY BEFORE THE NATURAL REACTION IS WHY THE HELL ARE YOU BRINGING IN ACCOUNTANTS TO WORK IN THE PLANT
c0rc022g YET WE PROBABLY HAVE THE LARGEST MANUFACTURING CONSULTING PRACTICE IN THE WORLD
c0rc022h THE AGENCY HAS BEEN UNDER GROWING PRESSURE FROM REPRESENTATIVE JOHN DINGELL D. MICHIGAN AND OTHER LAWMAKERS TO TIGHTEN REGULATION OF THE GENERICS INDUSTRY
c0rc022i SENATOR ORRIN HATCH R. UTAH RANKING MINORITY MEMBER ON THE SENATE LABOR AND HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE WELCOMED THE PLAN
c0rc022j IT IS MY STRONG BELIEF THAT SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE HAS BEEN UNCOVERED TO WARRANT THESE CHANGES HE SAID IN A STATEMENT

c0sc0202 HIS LAWYER PAUL ROONEY SAID MR.
c0sc0203 DAVIDOFF DEEPLY REGRETS HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE BOESKY COMPANY'S FAILURE TO REMAIN AT ALL TIMES IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION'S NET CAPITAL RULES
c0sc0204 MR. ROONEY EMPHASIZED THAT MR. DAVIDOFF WASN'T CHARGED WITH INSIDER TRADING
c0sc0205 WILLFUL VIOLATION OF THE CAPITAL RULE CARRIES A MAXIMUM PENALTY OF FIVE YEARS IN PRISON AND A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE
c0sc0206 THE LAW EVEN COMES WITH ITS OWN CATCH TWENTY TWO
c0sc0207 YOU'LL NEVER AGAIN BE ABLE TO FILL OUT YOUR OWN TAX RETURN ROGER TELLS ME
c0sc0208 BUT THE LAW ALSO SAYS YOU PROBABLY NO LONGER CAN DEDUCT THE COST OF HIRING PROFESSIONAL HELP
c0sc0209 A BORDEN SPOKESMAN CALLED THE COURT ORDER SOMEWHAT HARSH AND SAID THE COMPANY IS CONSIDERING AN APPEAL
c0sc020a MOST OF THE FINE STEMMED FROM BORDEN'S DELAY IN SEEKING A STATE PERMIT HE SAID
c0sc020b BORDEN SAID IT WOULD HAVE APPLIED SOONER BUT THE POLLUTION CONTROL EQUIPMENT WAS BADLY INSTALLED AND DIDN'T FUNCTION WELL

c0sc020e THE JAPANESE ELECTRONICS CONCERN IS AFFECTED BY THE U. S.'S NEWLY IMPOSED DUTIES ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL AT NIKKO SECURITIES COMPANY WHICH LED THE ISSUE
c0sc020f BUT IT ISN'T CLEAR HOW LARGE THE IMPACT WILL BE
c0sc020g WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO DEFER MEDIUM AND LONG TERM FINANCING SAYS MR. BLAKELY
c0sc020h IN FACT WE JUST REVIEWED THIS SUBJECT AND DECIDED TO WAIT UNTIL LATER THIS YEAR
c0sc020i STILL HE ADDS I THINK WE'RE HEADED FOR HIGHER RATES IN THE LONG TERM HOWEVER
c0sc020j THAT FOLKSY AND DIRECT APOLOGY WILL BE CARRIED IN NATIONWIDE NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENTS CHRYSLER PLANS TO START PLACING TODAY
c0sc020l DISCONNECTING ODOMETERS IS A LOUSY IDEA

c0sc020o TYCO MAKES FIRE PROTECTION PRODUCTS ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS AND PACKAGING MATERIALS
c0sc020p IN THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MAY THIRTY FIRST TYCO HAD SALES OF ABOUT ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS
c0sc020q FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH ATCOR HAD SALES OF FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS
c0sc020r BUT THE INCIDENT WASN'T REPORTED
c0sc020s AS MR. MCGOWAN REMEMBERS IT THE UNITED CAPTAIN WHO NORMALLY FILES SUCH REPORTS SIMPLY SAID LET'S FORGET ABOUT IT
c0sc020t IT'S NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE
c0sc020u BURMAH A BRITISH OIL COMPANY AND S. H. V. A DUTCH ENERGY CONCERN SAID THEY WOULD PROCEED WITH THEIR OFFER ONLY IF CALOR ENDORSED THE BID
c0sc020w HE ALSO RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT BURMAH MIGHT LAUNCH A BID ON ITS OWN
c0sc020y THE BENCHMARK CANADIAN NINE PERCENT BONDS DUE IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX WERE BID THIRTY BASIS POINTS LOWER
c0sc020z THE EURODOLLAR BOND MARKET STILL HAS A LOT OF UNDERLYING STRENGTH SAID A SENIOR TRADER FOR ONE EUROPEAN BANK

c0sc0212 IN THIS CASE THE J. C. S. CHIEF FEARED THAT CONGRESS MIGHT CURTAIL THE NAVY OPERATION IF THE U. S. REPEATEDLY LOOKED ILL PREPARED
c0sc0213 I HAD REALLY UNDERESTIMATED HOW INVOLVED CONGRESS WOULD GET AND HOW DETERMINED THEY WOULD BE TO POLITICIZE IT HE SAYS
c0sc0214 PEOPLE ARE SCARED SAID RICHARD ROSS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CENTER OF THE STUDY OF INVESTOR BEHAVIOR A RESEARCH ORGANIZATION IN CHICAGO
c0sc0215 WHEN THE MARKET GOES DOWN STOP ORDERS APPEAR LIKE CRAZY HE SAYS
c0sc0216 AND IN A VOLATILE UNCERTAIN MARKET LIKE THIS INVESTORS USE LIMIT ORDERS TO TRY TO MAKE SHORT TERM GAINS
c0sc0217 ASKED ABOUT A NEW PRESIDENTIAL AID REQUEST JIM WRIGHT TALKED ABOUT MORALITY
c0sc0218 IF I SCHEDULE IT THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE SOME MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP PASS IT HE SAID
c0sc0219 I DON'T WANT TO RUN IT OUT THERE AND BE DEFEATED AGAIN
c0sc021b AFTER ALL HE ISN'T THE ONE WHO HAS TO RISK GETTING HIT OVER THE HEAD WITH A METAL PIPE
c0sc021c IN THE OLD DAYS T. V. WAS CALLED ELECTRONIC VAUDEVILLE
c0sc021d BACK THEN EVERYONE LOVED THE RAZZMATAZZ OF THE VARIETY SHOW A LITTLE SINGING A LITTLE DANCING A LITTLE COMEDY
c0sc021e BUT TODAY NO ONE WANTS VARIETY ANYMORE
c0sc021f ACCORDING TO T. V. EXECUTIVE WISDOM THE OLD SONG AND DANCE IS DEAD OR AT LEAST CRIPPLED
c0sc021g WHOEVER HE IS HE WILL HAVE HIS HANDS FULL OF PROBLEMS FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC
c0sc021h THE GOVERNMENT'S FINANCES CRY OUT FOR A STRONG PRESIDENT TO GRAPPLE WITH THEM AND TO PERSUADE A CHAOTIC CONGRESS TO ACCEPT HIS PROGRAM
c0sc021i ALL OVER THE WORLD THERE ARE KNOTTY PROBLEMS FOR THE U. S. FROM LATIN AMERICA NICARAGUA AND PANAMA TO THE MIDDLE EAST
c0sc021j OUR PRESIDENCY IS NOT JUST A CEREMONIAL OFFICE ITS DEMANDS ARE SUCH AS TO TRY ANY MAN'S SPIRIT INTELLIGENCE AND POLITICAL SKILL
c0sc021k IN CONGRESS THE TOP TRADE NEGOTIATORS HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS CHAIRMAN DAN ROSTENKOWSKI D.
c0sc021l ILLINOIS AND SENATE FINANCE CHAIRMAN LLOYD BENTSEN D.
c0sc021m TEXAS WANT A TRADE BILL THAT WILL BECOME LAW RATHER THAN A POLITICAL VEHICLE IN AN ELECTION YEAR
c0sc021n THEY HAVE SOUGHT THE OPINIONS OF ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS BUT THEY SAY THEY WILL FIGHT FOR A SUBSTANTIVE RATHER THAN SYMBOLIC PIECE OF LEGISLATION
c0sc021o THAT GROWTH CAME IN RESPONSE TO A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES DURING THE SECOND HALF WHICH PROMPTED A FLOOD OF MORTGAGE APPLICATIONS
c0sc021p IT ALSO REFLECTED GOVERNMENT MEASURES TO STIMULATE DOMESTIC SPENDING
c0sc021q THE HOUSING BOOM IN TURN TRIGGERED HEAVY CONSUMER SPENDING ON HOUSEHOLD GOODS WHICH AIDED THE STRONG SECOND HALF ECONOMIC EXPANSION
c0sc021r INFLATION ADJUSTED GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT GREW TWO PERCENT IN THE THIRD QUARTER FROM THE PRIOR THREE MONTHS AND ONE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER
c0sc021s THE ARMY WANTS TO STOP BUYING THE TRUCKS WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO HAUL UP TO TEN TONS OF AMMUNITION MORTARS AND ROCKETS TO SOME PROSPECTIVE BATTLEFIELD
c0sc021t IT WANTS TO CONCENTRATE INSTEAD ON DEVELOPING A NEW SIXTEEN TON TRUCK
c0sc021u BUT MR. ASPIN WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN
c0sc021v AT HIS BEHEST AND AGAINST THE PENTAGON'S WISHES CONGRESS CONTINUES TO POUR MONEY INTO THE TRUCK PROGRAM
c0sc021w COMMISSION CHAIRMAN DENNIS PATRICK HOWEVER SAID HE THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE ECONOMIC INCENTIVES TO KEEP INDEPENDENT STATIONS ON CABLE SYSTEMS AS LONG AS THEY WERE POPULAR
c0sc021x MR. PATRICK ALSO SAID THAT ONE ORIGINAL CONCERN THAT NETWORK OWNERSHIP MIGHT IMPEDE THE GROWTH OF CABLE AS A COMPETITOR OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE
c0sc021y HOUSEHOLDS WITH CABLE T. V. HAVE INCREASED TO MORE THAN FORTY MILLION FROM ABOUT TEN MILLION IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX
c0sc021z IN JULY MULTIFAMILY UNIT STARTS ROSE EIGHTEEN POINT SEVEN PERCENT
c0sc0221 MULTIFAMILY HOUSING STARTS FELL NINE POINT FIVE PERCENT IN JUNE AND TWENTY TWO PERCENT IN MAY
c0sc0222 THE REBOUND IN JULY REFLECTS AN EASING OF BACKLOGS IN PERMIT APPROVALS FOR THIS SECTOR MR. SHEEHAN SAID
c0sc0223 LAST MONTH'S MULTIFAMILY UNIT STARTS WERE NINE POINT FIVE PERCENT BELOW THAT OF JULY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
c0sc0224 U. S. SHOE CORPORATION SAID IT ACQUIRED TWENTY NINE SHOE STORES FROM ARIZONA SHOE CORPORATION
c0sc0225 THE STORES ARE IN DENVER AND IN PHOENIX AND TUCSON ARIZONA
c0sc0226 TERMS WEREN'T DISCLOSED
c0sc0227 BUT MR. MCCONNELL IN RESPONSE SAID HE BELIEVED THAT AT LEAST SEVEN THOUSAND UNITS HAVE BEEN LOST SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY
c0sc0228 IN HIS EXPERIENCE OWNERS DO REGISTER UNITS EVEN IF THEY ARE EXEMPT FROM RENT CONTROL PRECISELY TO ESTABLISH THAT THEY ARE EXEMPT
c0sc0229 THOSE WHO WORK FOR THE RENT BOARD WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A SUBSTANTIAL LOSS OF HOUSING HE SAID
c0sc022a EVERYBODY ELSE IN TOWN WILL TELL YOU OTHERWISE
c0sc022b I WAS ENVIOUS OF MY TEAM'S SNATCHER A TALL SKINNY NURSE UNTIL I SAW WHAT SHE HAD TO ENDURE IN THE NAME OF ESPRIT DE CORPS
c0sc022c HER LONG LEGS WERE STRETCHED WIDE AND BOUND WITH RIBBONS TO THE HORNS OF THE DRAGON'S HEAD
c0sc022d HER TORSO WAS TAUT WITH TENSION LEANING OUT BEYOND THE BUMPY DRAGON'S HEAD UPON WHICH SHE RESTED HER STOMACH
c0sc022e WHERE DO YOU GO AROUND HERE TO HAVE A GOOD CRY SAID THE LIKABLE SEEMING THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD IN THE PRESS TENT AFTERWARD
c0sc022f CHOKING BACK SOBS HE REMARKED IT'S ONLY A GAME RIGHT
c0sc022g WHEN ASKED HE SAID THAT EVEN THE OUTLET OF GOING HOME AND KICKING HIS DOG WASN'T AVAILABLE
c0sc022h MY DOG'S JUST EIGHT WEEKS OLD HE EXPLAINED
c0sc022i INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SMALL MEDICAL BILLS IS ESPECIALLY WASTEFUL
c0sc022j USUALLY IT WILL COST AN INSURER MORE THAN FIFTY DOLLARS TO MONITOR EFFECTIVELY A FIFTY DOLLAR PHYSICIAN BILL THEREBY DOUBLING THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE
c0sc022k BUT FAILURE TO MONITOR ENCOURAGES PATIENTS AND DOCTORS TO MAKE WASTEFUL DECISIONS WITHOUT FEAR OF THIRD PARTY SCRUTINY
c0tc0201 BROKERAGE STOCKS HAVE BEEN WILTING FOR MONTHS
c0tc0202 SALOMON'S STOCK DIVED ELEVEN PERCENT ON HUGE VOLUME MONDAY CASTING A TEMPORARY PALL OVER THE WHOLE GROUP
c0tc0203 IT CLOSED YESTERDAY AT THIRTY NINE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS UP ONE EIGHTH
c0tc0204 <NOISE> TEXAS UTILITIES COMPANY SAID ITS TEXAS UTILITIES ELECTRIC COMPANY UNIT RECEIVED PERMISSION FROM THE STATE'S PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION TO REFUND ABOUT FIFTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO ITS CUSTOMERS
c0tc0205 THE COMPANY HAD ASKED FOR THE REFUND BECAUSE OF THE DECLINE IN ITS COSTS FOR NATURAL GAS
c0tc0206 THE REFUND WILL SHOW UP AS A CREDIT IN FEBRUARY ELECTRIC BILLS THE UNIT SAID
c0tc0207 THE COMPANIES' SHARPLY IMPROVED RESULTS PROVIDED MORE EVIDENCE OF A REBOUND IN BOTH THE CHIP AND PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRIES
c0tc0208 THE RESULTS FOLLOW A REPORT LAST WEEK FROM THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION THAT THE BELEAGUERED CHIP INDUSTRY IS EXPERIENCING AN UPTURN
c0tc0209 IN MARCH THE INDUSTRY'S LEADING INDICATOR REACHED THE HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
c0tc020a U. S. AIR OPERATES PRIMARILY IN THE EAST AND MIDWEST
c0tc020b <NOISE> P. S. A. SERVES TWENTY NINE AIRPORTS MAINLY ON THE WEST COAST
c0tc020c THE COMBINATION WOULD CREATE THE SEVENTH LARGEST DOMESTIC AIR CARRIER
c0tc020e HE WORRIES THAT AS CONSUMERS OPT FOR THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS THEY ARE NO LONGER BOTHERING TO EAT REAL BALANCED MEALS
c0tc020f INSTEAD HE SAYS THEY'RE EATING ONLY FOR SENSATION
c0tc020g MR. ROBINSON FIFTY EIGHT HAS BEEN CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRESIDENT AND WILL RETAIN THE POSITION OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE
c0tc020h THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY SAID JOHN C. HAIGH FORMERLY EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT SUCCEEDS MR. ROBINSON AS PRESIDENT
c0tc020i MR. HAIGH ALSO WAS NAMED CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER A POSITION THAT HAS BEEN VACANT SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
c0tc020j SENATOR LEAHY RETREATED AND JUDGE SENTELLE WAS UNANIMOUSLY CONFIRMED BY THE COMMITTEE ON APRIL TWENTY NINTH
c0tc020k BUT WITH SOME DEMOCRATS NO ACTION IS TOO SMALL IN THE EFFORT TO NEGATE A CONSERVATIVE PRESIDENCY
c0tc020m HE EXERCISED HIS RIGHT TO BLOCK A FLOOR VOTE ON JUDGE SENTELLE UNTIL THE SENATOR QUERIED THE A. B. A. REGARDING THE PROPRIETY OF THE JUDGE'S MEMBERSHIP IN THE MASONS
c0tc020n BUT SIX YEARS OF HUGE TRADE DEFICITS AND BUDGET DEFICITS HAVE CHANGED ALL THAT
c0tc020o BY THE END OF LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT SAYS FOREIGNERS HELD TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS MORE IN U. S. ASSETS THAN AMERICANS HELD OVERSEAS
c0tc020p SOME ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS DOUBT THE ACCURACY OF THOSE NUMBERS BUT NO ONE QUESTIONS THE TREND
c0tc020q SELLING THE CANADIAN BUSINESS WILL HELP T. L. C. GROUP COMPLETE ITS FINANCING ON THE REST OF BEATRICE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
c0tc020r T. L. C. GROUP SAID YESTERDAY THAT IT HAS A FIRM COMMITMENT FROM DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED ITS INVESTMENT BANKER TO FINANCE ITS ACQUISITION
c0tc020s A DREXEL SPOKESMAN SAID HE EXPECTS THE FINANCING TO COME THROUGH A COMBINATION OF BANK LOANS AND HIGH YIELD BONDS
c0tc020t DREXEL FINANCED THE KOHLBERG KRAVIS BUY OUT OF BEATRICE LAST YEAR
c0tc020u CRITICS OF THE INDEXING CHARGE THAT THE APPROACH LACKS IMAGINATION AND AMOUNTS TO SETTLING FOR MEDIOCRITY
c0tc020w ALSO INDEXING IN RECENT YEARS OFTEN HAS PRODUCED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER RESULTS THAN MANY ACTIVE MANAGERS
c0tc020x THE UTILITY WILL BEGIN PAYING INTEREST IN CASH AFTER SEABROOK GOES INTO SERVICE MR. BAYLESS SAID
c0tc020y MR. HARRISON SAID THE COMPANY DOESN'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO LEAP THE POLITICAL HURDLES THAT ARE BLOCKING SEABROOK
c0tc020z BUT THE FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING IS INTENDED TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING WITHOUT ADDITIONAL BORROWING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETEEN NINETY ONE HE SAID
c0tc0210 CERTAINLY FOREIGN COMPETITION AND A CHANGING WORLD ECONOMY HAVE EXACTED A HEAVY TOLL ON OUR NATION'S MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
c0tc0211 HOWEVER MANY OF THESE INDUSTRIES HAVE SURVIVED AND ARE NOW AS TOUGH AND LEAN AS THEY'VE EVER BEEN
c0tc0212 THE MANAGERS OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE LEARNED THROUGH HARD EXPERIENCE ABOUT EXACTLY WHICH INVESTMENTS PAY OFF
c0tc0213 ALSO BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE CASH GUZZLERS CONSTANTLY NEEDING MONEY FOR CLINICAL TRIALS AND MANUFACTURING FACILITIES
c0tc0214 THE CRITICAL FACTOR FOR MOST COMPANIES ISN'T HOW MUCH CASH THEY HAVE BUT HOW IT'S BEING SPENT MR. MACCALLUM SAYS
c0tc0215 SOME COMPANIES THAT ARE SELLING AT CLOSE TO THEIR PERSHARE CASH VALUES ARE CORRECTLY BEING PERCEIVED IN A SKEPTICAL LIGHT HE CONTENDS
c0tc0216 <NOISE> KIM YOUNG SAM WAS FORMALLY NOMINATED FOR PRESIDENT BY SOUTH KOREA'S MAIN OPPOSITION PARTY
c0tc0217 KIM WAS THE THIRD CANDIDATE TO OFFICIALLY ENTER THE RACE JOINING GOVERNMENT CANDIDATE ROH TAE WOO AND FORMER PRIME MINISTER KIM JONG PIL
c0tc0218 DISSIDENT LEADER KIM DAE JUNG ALSO INTENDS TO RUN
c0tc0219 THE ELECTION IS TO BE HELD BY DECEMBER TWENTIETH
c0tc021a THE WINNER IN THE GENERAL ELECTION USED SOME CREATIVE METHODS TOO
c0tc021b RONALD REAGAN'S CAMPAIGN REGISTERED VOTERS FOR THE GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN USING TWO MILLION DOLLARS CHARGED TO HIS UNCONTESTED RENOMINATION
c0tc021c THE STAFF OF THE ELECTION COMMISSION CHALLENGED THAT AND RECOMMENDED THAT SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FEDERAL SUBSIDIES BE REPAID TO THE TREASURY
c0tc021d BUT THE AUDITORS WERE OVERRULED BY A FOUR TO ONE VOTE OF THE COMMISSION IN WHICH ALL REPUBLICAN MEMBERS SIDED WITH THE PRESIDENT
c0tc021e MR. REICHLER RECENTLY STUNNED SOME LIBERALS WHEN HE AGREED TO REPRESENT THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT IN ITS QUEST TO WIN U. S. AID FOR ITS POLICE FORCE AND MILITARY
c0tc021f SOME HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS STRONGLY OPPOSED THE REQUEST CITING GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES' HISTORY OF ABUSES
c0tc021g MR. REICHLER LAUNCHED A LOBBYING BLITZ AMONG U. S. LIBERALS ARGUING THAT THE AID WOULD HELP STEM VIOLATIONS
c0tc021h THE POLICE GOT TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR TRAINING AND GUATEMALA GOT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN MILITARY ASSISTANCE
c0tc021i SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FRANK CARLUCCI HAS SAID I THINK A SMALLER MORE EFFECTIVE FORCE IS A MUCH BETTER DETERRENT THAN A LARGE LESS EFFECTIVE FORCE
c0tc021j PROBABLY TRUE
c0tc021k BUT THE BUDGET RULES OUT THE BEST OPTION WHICH IS A LARGE MORE EFFECTIVE FORCE
c0tc021l IN THE OLD DAYS T. V. WAS CALLED ELECTRONIC VAUDEVILLE
c0tc021m BACK THEN EVERYONE LOVED THE RAZZMATAZZ OF THE VARIETY SHOW A LITTLE SINGING A LITTLE DANCING A LITTLE COMEDY
c0tc021n BUT TODAY NO ONE WANTS VARIETY ANYMORE
c0tc021o ACCORDING TO T. V. EXECUTIVE WISDOM THE OLD SONG AND DANCE IS DEAD OR AT LEAST CRIPPLED
c0tc021p DUKAKIS DEFEATED JACKSON BY A THREE TO TWO MARGIN IN SATURDAY'S ARIZONA PRESIDENTIAL CAUCUSES
c0tc021q THE MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR WON TWENTY TWO DELEGATES TO THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION IN JULY
c0tc021r JACKSON RECEIVED FOURTEEN DELEGATES AND GORE GOT NONE
c0tc021s ALL THREE CANDIDATES CONTINUED CAMPAIGNING IN NEW YORK FOR TOMORROW'S PRIMARY ELECTION
c0tc021t BUT NETWORK OFFICIALS WILL SPEND MONTHS DEBATING C. B. S.'S WISDOM
c0tc021u IT'S TIME TO BE AGGRESSIVE SAID MR. PILSON TESTILY TAKING ON REPORTERS AT YESTERDAY'S PRESS CONFERENCE
c0tc021v I'M UP HERE STATING C. B. S. HAS ACQUIRED THE RIGHTS AND N. B. C. HASN'T
c0tc021w AT N. B. C. MR. WATSON WAS PHILOSOPHIC IF PRAGMATIC YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE A WINNER HE SAID
c0tc021x BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE AT THE SAME TIME
c0tc021y THE SALE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS NOT WIDELY EXPECTED
c0tc021z BUT DESPITE THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE THE NEWS HAD LITTLE NET EFFECT ON THE SECONDARY MARKET FOR NEW YORK BONDS
c0tc0220 THERE ISN'T ENOUGH SUPPLY FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE SIZABLE OFFERING TO HAVE MUCH IMPACT EXPLAINED ONE TRADER
c0tc0221 MR. DEMME THINKS A MAN WHO PLAYS SPOONS ON THE STREET IS FUNNY
c0tc0222 HE CASTS JOSEPH L. MR.
c0tc0223 <NOISE> SPOONS JONES TO PLAY HIMSELF A MAN WHO PLAYS SPOONS ON THE STREET

c0tc0225 <NOISE> REACTING TO THE EROSION OF CONFUCIAN VALUES MANY KOREANS ARE TURNING TO RELIGION ESPECIALLY CHRISTIANITY
c0tc0226 BUDDHISM IS ENJOYING A RESURGENCE AS WELL
c0tc0227 THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SAYS MR. SEO
c0tc0228 OTHERS ARE LOOKING TO THE PAST

c0tc022b S. E. C. CHAIRMAN DAVID RUDDER PRESENTED THE UNANIMOUS POSITION OF THE FIVE MEMBER COMMISSION AT A MEETING YESTERDAY OF SECURITIES REGULATORS IN MELBOURNE AUSTRALIA
c0tc022d HE ADDED THAT ULTIMATELY ALL COUNTRIES SHOULD SET UP AUTOMATED SYSTEMS FOR CLEARING AND SETTLING EQUITY AND DEBT TRANSACTIONS AND THAT MANY SUCH SYSTEMS SHOULD BE LINKED
c0tc022e <NOISE> WHETHER THE EAST GERMAN GOVERNMENT CAN EXTRICATE ITSELF FROM ITS CURRENT CRISIS IS A QUESTION THAT CONFOUNDS WESTERN ANALYSTS
c0tc022f HOWEVER MOST AGREE THAT EAST GERMANY IS LURCHING TOWARD CRISIS
c0tc022g <NOISE> ABOVE ALL IT IS A CRISIS THAT THE NATION'S AGING LEADERS SEEM UTTERLY CONFUSED BY
c0tc022h WITH THE REST OF THE EAST BLOC SWEPT UP IN A TIDE OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CHANGE EAST BERLIN HAS STEADFASTLY STUCK TO ITS OLD WAYS
c0tc022i YET THE GOVERNMENT LED BY SEVENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD ERICH HONECKER APPEARS ALMOST INCAPABLE OF GOVERNING AT A TIME THAT DEMANDS NEW IDEAS
c0uc0202 BY VIRTUE OF THEIR SIZE ALONE THEY WILL BE DOMINANT IN THE STATE MR. GRANT ADDED
c0uc0203 EXACTLY WHAT IMPACT THAT COMPETITION WILL HAVE IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS NOW HE SAID
c0uc0204 INDEED ANY CRIMINAL ACTIVITY WOULD NORMALLY BE GROUNDS FOR SUSPENDING A STUDENT HARVARD OFFICIALS SAY
c0uc0205 THE FACT IS INSIDER TRADING IS BUSINESS RELATED AND WE'RE A BUSINESS SCHOOL SAYS MR. LYNCH
c0uc0206 BUT I THINK OUR POSTURE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME IF IT WERE ANY KIND OF BEHAVIOR THAT WAS OF A CRIMINAL NATURE
c0uc0207 AS A LONGTIME MEMBER OF THE ANAHEIM CALIFORNIA
c0uc0208 REDEVELOPMENT COMMISSION THE RETIRED FOOD COMPANY EXECUTIVE TOOK PRIDE IN HELPING HIS CITY GROW
c0uc0209 BUT HE ALSO LOVED THE FREE SILVER PASS THAT DISNEYLAND GAVE HIM EVERY YEAR AS ONE OF NEARLY ONE THOUSAND LOCAL NOTABLES SO HONORED
c0uc020b BUT OTHER PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRANTS SEEK TO WOO LABOR WITH TOUGH TALK
c0uc020c BIDEN WOULD THREATEN TO LET THE DOLLAR SLIDE OR EVEN LINK TRADE TO THE PRESENCE OF U. S. TROOPS IN JAPAN AND GERMANY
c0uc020d THERE'S A CERTAIN AWAKENING AND STIRRING IN THE EUROPEAN MICROCHIP INDUSTRY SAID DOUGLAS DUNN MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE SEMICONDUCTOR DIVISION OF BRITAIN'S PLESSEY COMPANY

c0uc020o PFIZER ROSE THREE QUARTERS TO SEVENTY
c0uc020p MS. OATES DOESN'T SAY MUCH ABOUT PERSONAL POWER ABOUT BEING ABLE TO STAND UP TO OTHERS
c0uc020q BUT THE FEELING OF POWER AND CONFIDENCE IS WHAT WE LADY BOXERS AGREED WE LIKED MOST ABOUT OUR NEW SKILL
c0uc020r IT'S ALSO WHY WE ADVOCATE BOXING FOR ALL ESPECIALLY FOR LITTLE GIRLS WHO ARE STILL RAISED TO BELIEVE THEY DON'T HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE IN A MAN'S WORLD
c0uc020s L. T. V. HAS SAID REPEATEDLY SINCE ITS FILING THAT IT WOULD FIGHT ANY CREDITOR MOVE TO EITHER REORGANIZE THE UNIT SEPARATELY OR FORCE ITS SALE
c0uc020t CREDITORS ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE DISCUSSED THE IDEA ALMOST SINCE THE DAY OF L. T. V.'S FILING
