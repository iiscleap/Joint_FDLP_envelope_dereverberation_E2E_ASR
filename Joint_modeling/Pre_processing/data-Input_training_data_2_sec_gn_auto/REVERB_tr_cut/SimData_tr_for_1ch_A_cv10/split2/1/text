c2dc0204 I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO WALK PAST ANYTHING I BELIEVED TO BE WRONG WITHOUT SAYING SOMETHING MR. KAGLER SAYS
c2dc0205 SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY YEAH BUT YOU THINK TOO MUCH IS WRONG
c2dc0206 MAYBE I COULD HAVE BEEN MORE DIPLOMATIC
c2dc0207 BUT NO I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY
c2dc0208 IN FACT GIVEN THE HIGHLY DEVELOPED U. S. TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE FEW IF ANY SHIPPERS ARE TRULY CAPTIVE TO RAILS
c2dc0209 THE BEST CASE IS MADE BY ELECTRIC UTILITIES THAT HAVE POWER PLANTS SERVED BY COAL HAULING ROADS BUT BIG UTILITIES DON'T LACK BARGAINING POWER
c2dc020a FOR ONE THING THE STAGGERS ACT NOW ALLOWS LONG TERM CONTRACTS BETWEEN SHIPPERS AND RAILROADS
c2dc020b THAT INCREDIBLY WAS NOT ALLOWED UNDER THE OLD LAW BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD ONCE DECIDED THAT VOLUME DISCOUNTS TO BIG SHIPPERS WERE UNFAIR
c2dc020c IN DRAWING UP CONTRACTS THE RELEVANT FACT IS THAT BOTH THE RAILROAD AND THE UTILITY NEED EACH OTHER
c2dc020d SOME UTILITIES PARTICULARLY IN THE WEST HAVE SURPLUS CAPACITY MEANING THEY CAN SWITCH TO OTHER SOURCES IF HAULING COSTS AT A SINGLE PLANT RISE
c2dc020e THE HIGH WATER MARK SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY ONE WAS IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT
c2dc020f THAT WAS AMERICA'S HIGHEST MILITARY SPENDING YEAR DURING THE VIETNAM WAR NINE POINT SIX PERCENT OF THE G. N. P. WAS SPENT ON DEFENSE
c2dc020g BUT THAT WAS ALSO THE YEAR SOVIET TANKS ROLLED INTO PRAGUE
c2dc020h SO NINE POINT SIX PERCENT OF G. N. P. DOESN'T SEEM TO CONNECT WITH GEOPOLITICAL STABILITY
c2dc020i CALTON INCORPORATED A FREEHOLD TOWNSHIP N. J. RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER SAID SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED A RECAPITALIZATION PLAN CREATING A NEW CLASS OF STOCK
c2dc020j THE CLASS B. SHARES WHICH HAVE TEN TIMES THE VOTING POWER OF COMMON WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO CURRENT HOLDERS
c2dc020k CLASS B. SHARES CAN BE CONVERTED INTO REGULAR COMMON BUT GENERALLY WON'T BE TRANSFERABLE
c2dc020l SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD JULY THIRTY FIRST WILL GET ONE CLASS B. SHARE FOR EACH COMMON SHARE HELD
c2dc020m COMPANIES OFTEN CREATE DUAL CLASSES OF STOCK TO CONCENTRATE THE VOTING RIGHTS IN FRIENDLY HANDS THEREBY DISCOURAGING PEOPLE FROM MAKING UNFRIENDLY TAKEOVER BIDS
c2dc020n IN ADDITION TO A LARGE FUEL LOAD FOR THE FLIGHT TO PHOENIX ARIZONA THE FLIGHT WAS JAMMED WITH PASSENGERS

c2dc020s HER FATHER MOTHER AND BROTHER WERE ALSO PASSENGERS ON THE NORTHWEST AIRLINER AND DIED IN THE CRASH
c2dc020t REPRESENTATIVE GEPHARDT IS AT AGE FORTY SIX THE EMBODIMENT OF THE COOL POST WATERGATE POLITICIAN
c2dc020u HIS HAIR NEVER SEEMED RUFFLED HIS TIE WOULD NO DOUBT HANG STRAIGHT DOWN IN A TYPHOON
c2dc020v YET HE SPRINGS FROM THE GRITTY ALMOST TRIBAL WORLD OF SOUTH SAINT LOUIS
c2dc020w ANOTHER OPTION WOULD BE GOING PRIVATE IN A LEVERAGED BUY OUT
c2dc020x BUT ANALYSTS SAID MANAGEMENT WOULDN'T PREFER SUCH A PLAN BECAUSE IT WOULD MEAN CURTAILING THE COMPANY'S AMBITIOUS STORE EXPANSION PROGRAM
c2dc020y IN A LEVERAGED BUY OUT A SMALL GROUP OF INVESTORS ACQUIRES A COMPANY IN A TRANSACTION FINANCED LARGELY WITH BORROWING
c2dc020z ULTIMATELY THE DEBT IS PAID WITH FUNDS GENERATED BY THE ACQUIRED COMPANY'S OPERATIONS OR THE SALE OF ITS ASSETS
c2dc0210 PRICES OF ACTIVELY TRADED THIRTY YEAR TREASURY BONDS FELL A QUARTER POINT OR TWO DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS FOR EACH ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR FACE AMOUNT
c2dc0211 CORPORATE AND MUNICIPAL ISSUES ALSO DECLINED SLIGHTLY IN LIGHT TRADING
c2dc0212 UNDERWRITERS CONTINUED TO REPORT MEAGER DEMAND FOR A LARGE SLATE OF RECENT DEBT ISSUES DESPITE THE HIGHEST OFFERING YIELDS IN MORE THAN A YEAR
c2dc0213 BOND PRICES ROSE AMID EXPECTATIONS OF LOWER U. S. AND WEST GERMAN INTEREST RATES
c2dc0214 STOCK PRICES DECLINED BUT THE DROP WASN'T AS BAD AS MANY TRADERS EXPECTED
c2dc0215 THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS FELL EIGHTEEN POINT TWO FOUR POINTS TO ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE POINT TWO NINE
c2dc0216 O. T. C. ISSUES GENERALLY WERE FLAT
c2dc0217 THE PRESIDENT STRESSED THAT HE IS PROCEEDING ACCORDING TO LAW THROUGH CONGRESS AND WITH COMPLETE PRESS FREEDOM

c2dc021b MOST U. S. BANKS WERE CLOSED ALTHOUGH SEVERAL OF THE LARGER FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPARTMENTS REMAINED OPEN TO SERVICE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS AND TRADE WITH EUROPE
c2dc021c BUT EVEN THEY WOUND DOWN THEIR TRADING WHEN THE LONDON MARKET SHUT DOWN AROUND NOON E. S. T. OR AFTER THE CHICAGO FUTURES MARKET CLOSED LATER IN THE AFTERNOON
c2dc021d AFTER DEDUCTING NONRECURRING ITEMS THE U. S. X. STEEL UNIT NONETHELESS APPEARED TO TURN IN ONE OF ITS MOST PROFITABLE QUARTERS SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES
c2dc021e ON A PER TON BASIS PRETAX PROFIT DOUBLED TO ABOUT THIRTY SIX DOLLARS FROM EIGHTEEN DOLLARS IN THE THIRD QUARTER
c2dc021f HOWEVER THE PERFORMANCE FELL FAR SHORT OF U. S. X. CHAIRMAN DAVID RODERICK'S PREDICTION OF FIFTY DOLLAR PLUS PER TON PROFIT
c2dc021g HOWEVER THE LONG SIEGE OF CORPORATE COST CUTTING HAS ALREADY SLASHED CORPORATE PAYROLLS SO SEVERELY THAT MANY COMPANIES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THEIR BREAK EVEN LEVELS OF OPERATIONS
c2dc021h IN EFFECT THEY ALREADY ARE OPERATING AS IF IN A RECESSION SO LAYOFFS MIGHT PROVE RELATIVELY MODEST
c2dc021i IN ADDITION THE ROLE OF MANUFACTURING IN THE ECONOMY HAS FADED IN COMPARISON WITH THE GROWTH OF RECESSION RESISTANT SERVICE JOBS
c2dc021j MR. REAGAN VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED ATTORNEY GENERAL EDWIN MEESE WHO IS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR HIS ROLE IN ADVANCING A MIDDLE EAST OIL PIPELINE ADVOCATED BY ONE OF MR. MEESE'S FRIENDS
c2dc021k MR. REAGAN SAID HE COULDN'T REMEMBER BEING TOLD ANYTHING ABOUT THE PIPELINE AND EXPRESSED EVERY CONFIDENCE IN MR. MEESE'S INTEGRITY
c2dc021l HE ALSO CRITICIZED THE LYNCH MOB ATMOSPHERE THAT HAS ACCOMPANIED INVESTIGATIONS OF HIS AIDES
c2dc021m AMERICAN STANDARD SAID IT IS VERY PLEASED BY BLACK AND DECKER'S WITHDRAWAL

c2dc021q MANY BIG JAPANESE STEREO MAKERS INCLUDING NAMES LIKE SANYO AND SONY HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR YEARS TO DEVELOP SOMETHING AKIN TO TANDY'S NEW TECHNOLOGY
c2dc021r LIKE TANDY'S THOSE MACHINES ARE ABOUT TWO YEARS AWAY ANALYSTS SAY
c2dc021s COMPACT DISK RECORDERS THAT STORE COMPUTER DATA RATHER THAN SOUND ARE EXPECTED OUT THIS YEAR
c2dc021t <NOISE> CHECKOUT COUNTERS ARE PRIMARY IMPULSE BUYING SITUATIONS SAYS WILLARD BISHOP A FOOD RETAILING CONSULTANT
c2dc021u AND THERE'S TREMENDOUS COMPETITION FOR ATTENTION NOT ONLY FROM OTHER MAGAZINES BUT FROM ITEMS LIKE CANDY TOBACCO AND RAZOR BLADES MR. BISHOP ADDS
c2dc021v THAT'S WHY MAGAZINE EXECUTIVES SAY COVERS HAVE TO REACH OUT AND GRAB BUYERS
c2dc021w FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S THE BAFFLING CASE OF A YOUNG CHILD WHO SIMPLY STOPPED GROWING FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
c2dc021x DOCTORS COULDN'T IDENTIFY A MEDICAL REASON
c2dc021y THE TENTATIVE DIAGNOSIS HERE STRESS
c2dc021z SENSING THE FAMILY AS A WHOLE UNDER PRESSURE THE CHILD HAD BECOME AN EMOTIONAL CARETAKER TO THE PARENTS
c2dc0220 CRITICS ARGUE THAT HE MAY BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC THOUGH
c2dc0221 AND MR. DUKAKIS IS CERTAIN TO FACE MORE PRESSURE ON THE QUESTION FROM VICE PRESIDENT BUSH WHO SUPPORTS BOTH THE M. X. AND MIDGETMAN
c2dc0222 MOREOVER MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BEING CONSIDERED AS POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES FOR GOVERNOR DUKAKIS HAVE BACKED ONE OR THE OTHER MISSILE PLANS
c2dc0224 MS. LIU HAD HER FIRST CHILD A BOY TWO YEARS AGO
c2dc0225 SHE WAS URGED NOT TO HAVE ANOTHER

c2dc0227 THE STATE CHARGING BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY IS HOPING TO RECOVER ONE HUNDRED TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM SIX FORMER EPIC EXECUTIVES AND FROM ITS THREE REMAINING HOLDING COMPANIES

c2dc022a SHE SAID THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE NEW MODEL TO EXPAND THE MARKET RATHER THAN CANNIBALIZE SALES OF CONVENTIONAL MODELS
c2dc022b THE SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO CALIFORNIA COMPANY DECLINED TO PROJECT SALES FOR THE NEW MODEL
c2dc022c IN AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING YESTERDAY DIASONICS SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT TWO POINT EIGHT SEVEN FIVE DOLLARS
c2dc022d THE CRACK EPIDEMIC HAS JUST ABOUT SILENCED LIBERAL OPPOSITION TO TOUGH LAW AND ORDER POLICIES
c2dc022e IT IS OBVIOUSLY RIDICULOUS TO TALK ABOUT REHABILITATING AN UZI TOTING DRUG PUSHER WHO MAKES FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A WEEK
c2dc022g THERE IS NOTHING A SOCIAL WORKER IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO FOR HIM ESPECIALLY SINCE THE SOCIAL WORKER IS TOO AFRAID TO VENTURE INTO HIS NEIGHBORHOOD
c2ec0201 DREXEL BURNHAM HAD A MAJOR ROLE IN EVERY TRANSACTION UNDER INVESTIGATION IN THE IVAN BOESKY INSIDER TRADING CASE AN ANALYSIS SHOWS
c2ec0202 IT ALSO HAS EMERGED THAT BOESKY HIMSELF WAS A MAJOR INVESTOR IN EVERY INSTANCE
c2ec0203 BOESKY MEANWHILE APPEARS TO HAVE SPEEDED UP THE LIQUIDATION OF HIS OPERATIONS
c2ec0204 CONGRESSIONAL PAY ON THE OTHER HAND POSES A DIFFERENT SET OF PROBLEMS
c2ec0205 WOMEN AND MEN NOW SPEND MILLIONS ON POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS FOR JOBS THAT PAY SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS
c2ec0206 WHAT DOES THE ELECTORATE GET IN RETURN

c2ec0208 MR. JACOBS HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS TO LEAVE ON FEBRUARY FIRST TO FORM A NEW FIRM WITH ANOTHER PARTNER JOHN F. GERARD

c2ec020s SUCH A FILING IS REQUIRED UNDER ANTITRUST LAW IF AN INVESTOR WISHES TO INCREASE HIS HOLDINGS ABOVE THAT LEVEL
c2ec020t IF HIS REQUEST IS GRANTED HE AND HIS GROUP COULD BUY AS MUCH AS FIFTEEN PERCENT OF TEXACO
c2ec020u A PURCHASE OF MORE THAN FIFTEEN PERCENT WOULD REQUIRE ANOTHER FILING WITH THE AGENCIES
c2ec020v CARNER STARTED THE FOURTH ROUND AT EVEN PAR TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN THREE BEHIND OKAMOTO AND TWO BEHIND DAVIES
c2ec020w ARE YOU SURE THIS IS PLAINFIELD SHE ASKED NO ONE IN PARTICULAR ON THE FIRST TEE EYEING THE SUNNY SKIES

c2ec021r WHILE NICKEL AND ESPECIALLY COPPER QUOTES HAVE SINCE REBOUNDED ALUMINUM PRICES HAVE CONTINUED TO TUMBLE
c2ec021s IT SEEMS TO BE IN PEOPLE'S INTEREST TO KEEP THE PRICE DOWN RIGHT NOW SAYS ONE LONDON EXCHANGE TRADER
c2ec021t THIS WILL ULTIMATELY GIVE THEM MORE BUYING OPPORTUNITIES DOWN THE LINE
c2ec021u I HAVE NO DOUBT THOUGH THAT THE THRUST OF FED POLICY WILL BE MORE TOWARD EASE THAN RESTRAINT MR. ROBERTSON ADDS
c2ec021v FED OFFICIALS WILL BE MUCH MORE INCLINED TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF EASE
c2ec021x THE POINT A POINT MR. CAMPBELL KEEPS RETURNING TO IS THAT EVERY RELIGION IS TRUE
c2ec021y IT'S TRUE AS A METAPHOR FOR THE HUMAN AND COSMIC MYSTERIES
c2ec021z IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU'RE STUCK ON THE METAPHOR THAT YOU GET IN TROUBLE
c2ec0221 ALL THIS BUSINESS ABOUT CRACK AND DRUGS AND THE POLICE ARE CATEGORIES THAT DRAW ATTENTION TO THINGS THAT ARE NOT IN HIS FAVOR
c2ec0222 HE'S GUILTY OF ALLOWING HIMSELF TO BE DRAGGED INTO THE DEMOCRATIC AGENDA
c2ec0223 BUT MR. PARCHER IS ALSO CONSIDERED ABRASIVE AT TIMES
c2ec0224 HE RUBS SOME PEOPLE WRONG SAYS LEONARD MARKS WHO HAS TRIED CASES AGAINST HIM
c2ec0225 HE'S VERY OUTSPOKEN
c2ec0226 HIS ANNOUNCED PURPOSE WILL BE TO RALLY THE PARTY AND GIVE A BOOST TO THE CANDIDACY OF GEORGE BUSH TO SUCCEED HIM
c2ec0227 THIS HE UNDOUBTEDLY WILL TRY TO DO FOR THE POLITICS OF THE DEMOCRATS' MICHAEL DUKAKIS IS HARDLY IN THE REAGAN MOLD
c2ec0228 BUT THE PRESIDENT I DARE PREDICT WILL TRY TO GIVE MR. BUSH A BOOST BY SPEAKING WITH PRIDE OF HIS OWN EIGHT YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE
c2ec0229 ONE BIG PLAY LAST YEAR WAS LEISURE
c2ec022a ANOTHER WAS UNDERVALUED ASSETS EVEN THOUGH NO ONE CAN RECALL A JAPANESE COMPANY BEING BROKEN UP FOR ITS ASSETS
c2ec022b ONCE YOU GET THAT THEME THE LEVEL OF THE P. SLASH E. RATIO DOESN'T MEAN A DAMN SAYS MR. ROBINS
c2ec022c IT'S ALL A BIT OF A MIRAGE
c2ec022d YET ONE THAT SO FAR HAS WORKED
c2ec022e MANY OF THE NATION'S MAJOR OIL COMPANIES HAVE EITHER SETTLED OR HAVE BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF ILLEGAL PRICING
c2ec022f EXXON CORPORATION MADE THE LARGEST PAYMENT TO DATE WHEN IT WAS ORDERED TO DISGORGE TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS

c2fc0201 FIRST OF ALL THE POLICY CONSERVATIVES WILL PURSUE THEIR UNFINISHED AGENDA OF DEREGULATION IN AREAS FROM FINANCIAL SERVICES TO REGULATION AS A DRAG ON U. S. INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
c2fc0202 THEY SAY THE ADMINISTRATION MISSED ITS CHANCE AND ALLOWED ITS DEREGULATORY CAMPAIGN TO BE ALL BUT ABORTED BY CONTROVERSY OVER ANNE GORSUCH AND JIM WATT
c2fc0203 THEY THINK THEIR GENERAL CASE IN THIS AREA IS OVERWHELMING
c2fc0204 THEY WILL GIVE IT NEW APPLICATIONS AND CARRY IT TO NEW FORUMS
c2fc0205 TWO YEARS AGO HE TRIED TO BRING CHEAPER GASOLINE TO JAPAN FROM SINGAPORE ONLY TO RUN INTO GOVERNMENT OPPOSITION
c2fc0206 NOW HE IS ENGAGED ONCE MORE IN A CAMPAIGN AGAINST WHAT HE CALLS THE GOVERNMENT'S OVERREGULATION OF THE JAPANESE ECONOMY

c2fc020c A SPOKESMAN IN THE U. S. SAYS THE IDEA IS TO CREATE A CLEARINGHOUSE FOR THE SALES OF U. S. PROPERTIES BOTH SHUWA'S AND THOSE OWNED BY OTHERS
c2fc020d SHUWA SAYS IT ISN'T AIMING TO SELL TO INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS BUT TO INSTITUTIONS AND LARGE INVESTORS
c2fc020e STILL THE SALES OFFICE IS UNUSUAL FOR INSTITUTIONAL BUSINESS MOREOVER IT WILL BE ON THE GINZA AN ADDRESS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH RETAIL SHOPPING
c2fc020f BUT THE NEW LAW ALSO CONTAINS NEGATIVES FOR MUNICIPAL BONDS
c2fc020g FOR PEOPLE WHO PAY THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX THE PRIVATE PURPOSE VARIETY IS NOW SUBJECT TO TAX
c2fc020h AND THE LOWERING OF TAX BRACKETS MEANS THAT THE SHELTER FEATURE IS LESS CRUCIAL THAN IT ONCE WAS
c2fc020i CABLE OPERATORS ARE WILLING PARTICIPANTS IN THE PRICE CUTTING PROGRAMS

c2fc020m IT'S ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO A SOCIETY WHEN IT GROWS OLD AND TRIES TO KEEP THE STATUS QUO INSTEAD OF LETTING ITS MORE CREATIVE INSTINCTS TAKE OVER
c2fc020n ALTHOUGH TUCKER IS SET IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES MR. LUCAS MAKES IT CLEAR HE THINKS THE FILM'S SUBJECT IS CURRENT AND QUITE PERSONAL
c2fc020o AS FOR THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY IT IS SEEKING TO RETAIN THE REMAINING LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST BANK INTRUSIONS
c2fc020p INVESTMENT BANKERS WARN OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND SELF DEALING IF COMMERCIAL BANKERS ARE ALLOWED TO COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH THEM
c2fc020q DESPITE THE BANKERS' DIRE WARNINGS THEY ARGUE THE CIRCUMSTANCES DON'T CALL FOR CHANGING THE HALF CENTURY OLD SYSTEM

c2fc0210 ACCORDING TO RECENT INDUSTRY STATISTICS THE POST'S DAILY CIRCULATION IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND THE CHRONICLE'S APPROXIMATES FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
c2fc0212 EVEN THE TRADITIONAL GREEN STAMP MIGHT BECOME A THING OF THE PAST
c2fc0213 IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMERS' COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE TASK OF PASTING IN TRADING STAMPS SPERRY AND HUTCHINSON COMPANY IS TESTING ELECTRONIC GREEN STAMPS IN SUPERMARKETS IN CONNECTICUT
c2fc0214 INSTEAD OF RECEIVING PAPER STAMPS CONSUMERS HAND THE CASHIER A PLASTIC CARD
c2fc0215 THE CARD IS INSERTED INTO A TERMINAL THAT AUTOMATICALLY RECORDS THE NUMBER OF STAMPS ACCRUED
c2fc0216 AND COMPARING GENERAL PARTNERS' FEES CAN BE TRICKY
c2fc0217 SPONSORS COMPETE PRIMARILY ON THE CURRENT YIELDS THEY'RE ABLE TO OFFER
