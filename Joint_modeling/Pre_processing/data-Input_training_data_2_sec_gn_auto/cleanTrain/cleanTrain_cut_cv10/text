c2dc0204 I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO WALK PAST ANYTHING I BELIEVED TO BE WRONG WITHOUT SAYING SOMETHING MR. KAGLER SAYS
c2dc0205 SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY YEAH BUT YOU THINK TOO MUCH IS WRONG
c2dc0206 MAYBE I COULD HAVE BEEN MORE DIPLOMATIC
c2dc0207 BUT NO I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY
c2dc0208 IN FACT GIVEN THE HIGHLY DEVELOPED U. S. TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE FEW IF ANY SHIPPERS ARE TRULY CAPTIVE TO RAILS
c2dc0209 THE BEST CASE IS MADE BY ELECTRIC UTILITIES THAT HAVE POWER PLANTS SERVED BY COAL HAULING ROADS BUT BIG UTILITIES DON'T LACK BARGAINING POWER
c2dc020a FOR ONE THING THE STAGGERS ACT NOW ALLOWS LONG TERM CONTRACTS BETWEEN SHIPPERS AND RAILROADS
c2dc020b THAT INCREDIBLY WAS NOT ALLOWED UNDER THE OLD LAW BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD ONCE DECIDED THAT VOLUME DISCOUNTS TO BIG SHIPPERS WERE UNFAIR
c2dc020c IN DRAWING UP CONTRACTS THE RELEVANT FACT IS THAT BOTH THE RAILROAD AND THE UTILITY NEED EACH OTHER
c2dc020d SOME UTILITIES PARTICULARLY IN THE WEST HAVE SURPLUS CAPACITY MEANING THEY CAN SWITCH TO OTHER SOURCES IF HAULING COSTS AT A SINGLE PLANT RISE
c2dc020e THE HIGH WATER MARK SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY ONE WAS IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT
c2dc020f THAT WAS AMERICA'S HIGHEST MILITARY SPENDING YEAR DURING THE VIETNAM WAR NINE POINT SIX PERCENT OF THE G. N. P. WAS SPENT ON DEFENSE
c2dc020g BUT THAT WAS ALSO THE YEAR SOVIET TANKS ROLLED INTO PRAGUE
c2dc020h SO NINE POINT SIX PERCENT OF G. N. P. DOESN'T SEEM TO CONNECT WITH GEOPOLITICAL STABILITY
c2dc020i CALTON INCORPORATED A FREEHOLD TOWNSHIP N. J. RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER SAID SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED A RECAPITALIZATION PLAN CREATING A NEW CLASS OF STOCK
c2dc020j THE CLASS B. SHARES WHICH HAVE TEN TIMES THE VOTING POWER OF COMMON WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO CURRENT HOLDERS
c2dc020k CLASS B. SHARES CAN BE CONVERTED INTO REGULAR COMMON BUT GENERALLY WON'T BE TRANSFERABLE
c2dc020l SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD JULY THIRTY FIRST WILL GET ONE CLASS B. SHARE FOR EACH COMMON SHARE HELD
c2dc020m COMPANIES OFTEN CREATE DUAL CLASSES OF STOCK TO CONCENTRATE THE VOTING RIGHTS IN FRIENDLY HANDS THEREBY DISCOURAGING PEOPLE FROM MAKING UNFRIENDLY TAKEOVER BIDS
c2dc020n IN ADDITION TO A LARGE FUEL LOAD FOR THE FLIGHT TO PHOENIX ARIZONA THE FLIGHT WAS JAMMED WITH PASSENGERS

c2dc020s HER FATHER MOTHER AND BROTHER WERE ALSO PASSENGERS ON THE NORTHWEST AIRLINER AND DIED IN THE CRASH
c2dc020t REPRESENTATIVE GEPHARDT IS AT AGE FORTY SIX THE EMBODIMENT OF THE COOL POST WATERGATE POLITICIAN
c2dc020u HIS HAIR NEVER SEEMED RUFFLED HIS TIE WOULD NO DOUBT HANG STRAIGHT DOWN IN A TYPHOON
c2dc020v YET HE SPRINGS FROM THE GRITTY ALMOST TRIBAL WORLD OF SOUTH SAINT LOUIS
c2dc020w ANOTHER OPTION WOULD BE GOING PRIVATE IN A LEVERAGED BUY OUT
c2dc020x BUT ANALYSTS SAID MANAGEMENT WOULDN'T PREFER SUCH A PLAN BECAUSE IT WOULD MEAN CURTAILING THE COMPANY'S AMBITIOUS STORE EXPANSION PROGRAM
c2dc020y IN A LEVERAGED BUY OUT A SMALL GROUP OF INVESTORS ACQUIRES A COMPANY IN A TRANSACTION FINANCED LARGELY WITH BORROWING
c2dc020z ULTIMATELY THE DEBT IS PAID WITH FUNDS GENERATED BY THE ACQUIRED COMPANY'S OPERATIONS OR THE SALE OF ITS ASSETS
c2dc0210 PRICES OF ACTIVELY TRADED THIRTY YEAR TREASURY BONDS FELL A QUARTER POINT OR TWO DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS FOR EACH ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR FACE AMOUNT
c2dc0211 CORPORATE AND MUNICIPAL ISSUES ALSO DECLINED SLIGHTLY IN LIGHT TRADING
c2dc0212 UNDERWRITERS CONTINUED TO REPORT MEAGER DEMAND FOR A LARGE SLATE OF RECENT DEBT ISSUES DESPITE THE HIGHEST OFFERING YIELDS IN MORE THAN A YEAR
c2dc0213 BOND PRICES ROSE AMID EXPECTATIONS OF LOWER U. S. AND WEST GERMAN INTEREST RATES
c2dc0214 STOCK PRICES DECLINED BUT THE DROP WASN'T AS BAD AS MANY TRADERS EXPECTED
c2dc0215 THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS FELL EIGHTEEN POINT TWO FOUR POINTS TO ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE POINT TWO NINE
c2dc0216 O. T. C. ISSUES GENERALLY WERE FLAT
c2dc0217 THE PRESIDENT STRESSED THAT HE IS PROCEEDING ACCORDING TO LAW THROUGH CONGRESS AND WITH COMPLETE PRESS FREEDOM

c2dc021b MOST U. S. BANKS WERE CLOSED ALTHOUGH SEVERAL OF THE LARGER FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPARTMENTS REMAINED OPEN TO SERVICE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS AND TRADE WITH EUROPE
c2dc021c BUT EVEN THEY WOUND DOWN THEIR TRADING WHEN THE LONDON MARKET SHUT DOWN AROUND NOON E. S. T. OR AFTER THE CHICAGO FUTURES MARKET CLOSED LATER IN THE AFTERNOON
c2dc021d AFTER DEDUCTING NONRECURRING ITEMS THE U. S. X. STEEL UNIT NONETHELESS APPEARED TO TURN IN ONE OF ITS MOST PROFITABLE QUARTERS SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES
c2dc021e ON A PER TON BASIS PRETAX PROFIT DOUBLED TO ABOUT THIRTY SIX DOLLARS FROM EIGHTEEN DOLLARS IN THE THIRD QUARTER
c2dc021f HOWEVER THE PERFORMANCE FELL FAR SHORT OF U. S. X. CHAIRMAN DAVID RODERICK'S PREDICTION OF FIFTY DOLLAR PLUS PER TON PROFIT
c2dc021g HOWEVER THE LONG SIEGE OF CORPORATE COST CUTTING HAS ALREADY SLASHED CORPORATE PAYROLLS SO SEVERELY THAT MANY COMPANIES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THEIR BREAK EVEN LEVELS OF OPERATIONS
c2dc021h IN EFFECT THEY ALREADY ARE OPERATING AS IF IN A RECESSION SO LAYOFFS MIGHT PROVE RELATIVELY MODEST
c2dc021i IN ADDITION THE ROLE OF MANUFACTURING IN THE ECONOMY HAS FADED IN COMPARISON WITH THE GROWTH OF RECESSION RESISTANT SERVICE JOBS
c2dc021j MR. REAGAN VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED ATTORNEY GENERAL EDWIN MEESE WHO IS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR HIS ROLE IN ADVANCING A MIDDLE EAST OIL PIPELINE ADVOCATED BY ONE OF MR. MEESE'S FRIENDS
c2dc021k MR. REAGAN SAID HE COULDN'T REMEMBER BEING TOLD ANYTHING ABOUT THE PIPELINE AND EXPRESSED EVERY CONFIDENCE IN MR. MEESE'S INTEGRITY
c2dc021l HE ALSO CRITICIZED THE LYNCH MOB ATMOSPHERE THAT HAS ACCOMPANIED INVESTIGATIONS OF HIS AIDES
c2dc021m AMERICAN STANDARD SAID IT IS VERY PLEASED BY BLACK AND DECKER'S WITHDRAWAL

c2dc021q MANY BIG JAPANESE STEREO MAKERS INCLUDING NAMES LIKE SANYO AND SONY HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR YEARS TO DEVELOP SOMETHING AKIN TO TANDY'S NEW TECHNOLOGY
c2dc021r LIKE TANDY'S THOSE MACHINES ARE ABOUT TWO YEARS AWAY ANALYSTS SAY
c2dc021s COMPACT DISK RECORDERS THAT STORE COMPUTER DATA RATHER THAN SOUND ARE EXPECTED OUT THIS YEAR
c2dc021t <NOISE> CHECKOUT COUNTERS ARE PRIMARY IMPULSE BUYING SITUATIONS SAYS WILLARD BISHOP A FOOD RETAILING CONSULTANT
c2dc021u AND THERE'S TREMENDOUS COMPETITION FOR ATTENTION NOT ONLY FROM OTHER MAGAZINES BUT FROM ITEMS LIKE CANDY TOBACCO AND RAZOR BLADES MR. BISHOP ADDS
c2dc021v THAT'S WHY MAGAZINE EXECUTIVES SAY COVERS HAVE TO REACH OUT AND GRAB BUYERS
c2dc021w FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S THE BAFFLING CASE OF A YOUNG CHILD WHO SIMPLY STOPPED GROWING FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
c2dc021x DOCTORS COULDN'T IDENTIFY A MEDICAL REASON
c2dc021y THE TENTATIVE DIAGNOSIS HERE STRESS
c2dc021z SENSING THE FAMILY AS A WHOLE UNDER PRESSURE THE CHILD HAD BECOME AN EMOTIONAL CARETAKER TO THE PARENTS
c2dc0220 CRITICS ARGUE THAT HE MAY BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC THOUGH
c2dc0221 AND MR. DUKAKIS IS CERTAIN TO FACE MORE PRESSURE ON THE QUESTION FROM VICE PRESIDENT BUSH WHO SUPPORTS BOTH THE M. X. AND MIDGETMAN
c2dc0222 MOREOVER MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BEING CONSIDERED AS POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES FOR GOVERNOR DUKAKIS HAVE BACKED ONE OR THE OTHER MISSILE PLANS
c2dc0224 MS. LIU HAD HER FIRST CHILD A BOY TWO YEARS AGO
c2dc0225 SHE WAS URGED NOT TO HAVE ANOTHER

c2dc0227 THE STATE CHARGING BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY IS HOPING TO RECOVER ONE HUNDRED TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM SIX FORMER EPIC EXECUTIVES AND FROM ITS THREE REMAINING HOLDING COMPANIES

c2dc022a SHE SAID THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE NEW MODEL TO EXPAND THE MARKET RATHER THAN CANNIBALIZE SALES OF CONVENTIONAL MODELS
c2dc022b THE SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO CALIFORNIA COMPANY DECLINED TO PROJECT SALES FOR THE NEW MODEL
c2dc022c IN AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING YESTERDAY DIASONICS SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT TWO POINT EIGHT SEVEN FIVE DOLLARS
c2dc022d THE CRACK EPIDEMIC HAS JUST ABOUT SILENCED LIBERAL OPPOSITION TO TOUGH LAW AND ORDER POLICIES
c2dc022e IT IS OBVIOUSLY RIDICULOUS TO TALK ABOUT REHABILITATING AN UZI TOTING DRUG PUSHER WHO MAKES FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A WEEK
c2dc022g THERE IS NOTHING A SOCIAL WORKER IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO FOR HIM ESPECIALLY SINCE THE SOCIAL WORKER IS TOO AFRAID TO VENTURE INTO HIS NEIGHBORHOOD
c2ec0201 DREXEL BURNHAM HAD A MAJOR ROLE IN EVERY TRANSACTION UNDER INVESTIGATION IN THE IVAN BOESKY INSIDER TRADING CASE AN ANALYSIS SHOWS
c2ec0202 IT ALSO HAS EMERGED THAT BOESKY HIMSELF WAS A MAJOR INVESTOR IN EVERY INSTANCE
c2ec0203 BOESKY MEANWHILE APPEARS TO HAVE SPEEDED UP THE LIQUIDATION OF HIS OPERATIONS
c2ec0204 CONGRESSIONAL PAY ON THE OTHER HAND POSES A DIFFERENT SET OF PROBLEMS
c2ec0205 WOMEN AND MEN NOW SPEND MILLIONS ON POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS FOR JOBS THAT PAY SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS
c2ec0206 WHAT DOES THE ELECTORATE GET IN RETURN

c2ec0208 MR. JACOBS HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS TO LEAVE ON FEBRUARY FIRST TO FORM A NEW FIRM WITH ANOTHER PARTNER JOHN F. GERARD

c2ec020s SUCH A FILING IS REQUIRED UNDER ANTITRUST LAW IF AN INVESTOR WISHES TO INCREASE HIS HOLDINGS ABOVE THAT LEVEL
c2ec020t IF HIS REQUEST IS GRANTED HE AND HIS GROUP COULD BUY AS MUCH AS FIFTEEN PERCENT OF TEXACO
c2ec020u A PURCHASE OF MORE THAN FIFTEEN PERCENT WOULD REQUIRE ANOTHER FILING WITH THE AGENCIES
c2ec020v CARNER STARTED THE FOURTH ROUND AT EVEN PAR TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN THREE BEHIND OKAMOTO AND TWO BEHIND DAVIES
c2ec020w ARE YOU SURE THIS IS PLAINFIELD SHE ASKED NO ONE IN PARTICULAR ON THE FIRST TEE EYEING THE SUNNY SKIES

c2ec021r WHILE NICKEL AND ESPECIALLY COPPER QUOTES HAVE SINCE REBOUNDED ALUMINUM PRICES HAVE CONTINUED TO TUMBLE
c2ec021s IT SEEMS TO BE IN PEOPLE'S INTEREST TO KEEP THE PRICE DOWN RIGHT NOW SAYS ONE LONDON EXCHANGE TRADER
c2ec021t THIS WILL ULTIMATELY GIVE THEM MORE BUYING OPPORTUNITIES DOWN THE LINE
c2ec021u I HAVE NO DOUBT THOUGH THAT THE THRUST OF FED POLICY WILL BE MORE TOWARD EASE THAN RESTRAINT MR. ROBERTSON ADDS
c2ec021v FED OFFICIALS WILL BE MUCH MORE INCLINED TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF EASE
c2ec021x THE POINT A POINT MR. CAMPBELL KEEPS RETURNING TO IS THAT EVERY RELIGION IS TRUE
c2ec021y IT'S TRUE AS A METAPHOR FOR THE HUMAN AND COSMIC MYSTERIES
c2ec021z IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU'RE STUCK ON THE METAPHOR THAT YOU GET IN TROUBLE
c2ec0221 ALL THIS BUSINESS ABOUT CRACK AND DRUGS AND THE POLICE ARE CATEGORIES THAT DRAW ATTENTION TO THINGS THAT ARE NOT IN HIS FAVOR
c2ec0222 HE'S GUILTY OF ALLOWING HIMSELF TO BE DRAGGED INTO THE DEMOCRATIC AGENDA
c2ec0223 BUT MR. PARCHER IS ALSO CONSIDERED ABRASIVE AT TIMES
c2ec0224 HE RUBS SOME PEOPLE WRONG SAYS LEONARD MARKS WHO HAS TRIED CASES AGAINST HIM
c2ec0225 HE'S VERY OUTSPOKEN
c2ec0226 HIS ANNOUNCED PURPOSE WILL BE TO RALLY THE PARTY AND GIVE A BOOST TO THE CANDIDACY OF GEORGE BUSH TO SUCCEED HIM
c2ec0227 THIS HE UNDOUBTEDLY WILL TRY TO DO FOR THE POLITICS OF THE DEMOCRATS' MICHAEL DUKAKIS IS HARDLY IN THE REAGAN MOLD
c2ec0228 BUT THE PRESIDENT I DARE PREDICT WILL TRY TO GIVE MR. BUSH A BOOST BY SPEAKING WITH PRIDE OF HIS OWN EIGHT YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE
c2ec0229 ONE BIG PLAY LAST YEAR WAS LEISURE
c2ec022a ANOTHER WAS UNDERVALUED ASSETS EVEN THOUGH NO ONE CAN RECALL A JAPANESE COMPANY BEING BROKEN UP FOR ITS ASSETS
c2ec022b ONCE YOU GET THAT THEME THE LEVEL OF THE P. SLASH E. RATIO DOESN'T MEAN A DAMN SAYS MR. ROBINS
c2ec022c IT'S ALL A BIT OF A MIRAGE
c2ec022d YET ONE THAT SO FAR HAS WORKED
c2ec022e MANY OF THE NATION'S MAJOR OIL COMPANIES HAVE EITHER SETTLED OR HAVE BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF ILLEGAL PRICING
c2ec022f EXXON CORPORATION MADE THE LARGEST PAYMENT TO DATE WHEN IT WAS ORDERED TO DISGORGE TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS

c2fc0201 FIRST OF ALL THE POLICY CONSERVATIVES WILL PURSUE THEIR UNFINISHED AGENDA OF DEREGULATION IN AREAS FROM FINANCIAL SERVICES TO REGULATION AS A DRAG ON U. S. INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
c2fc0202 THEY SAY THE ADMINISTRATION MISSED ITS CHANCE AND ALLOWED ITS DEREGULATORY CAMPAIGN TO BE ALL BUT ABORTED BY CONTROVERSY OVER ANNE GORSUCH AND JIM WATT
c2fc0203 THEY THINK THEIR GENERAL CASE IN THIS AREA IS OVERWHELMING
c2fc0204 THEY WILL GIVE IT NEW APPLICATIONS AND CARRY IT TO NEW FORUMS
c2fc0205 TWO YEARS AGO HE TRIED TO BRING CHEAPER GASOLINE TO JAPAN FROM SINGAPORE ONLY TO RUN INTO GOVERNMENT OPPOSITION
c2fc0206 NOW HE IS ENGAGED ONCE MORE IN A CAMPAIGN AGAINST WHAT HE CALLS THE GOVERNMENT'S OVERREGULATION OF THE JAPANESE ECONOMY

c2fc020c A SPOKESMAN IN THE U. S. SAYS THE IDEA IS TO CREATE A CLEARINGHOUSE FOR THE SALES OF U. S. PROPERTIES BOTH SHUWA'S AND THOSE OWNED BY OTHERS
c2fc020d SHUWA SAYS IT ISN'T AIMING TO SELL TO INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS BUT TO INSTITUTIONS AND LARGE INVESTORS
c2fc020e STILL THE SALES OFFICE IS UNUSUAL FOR INSTITUTIONAL BUSINESS MOREOVER IT WILL BE ON THE GINZA AN ADDRESS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH RETAIL SHOPPING
c2fc020f BUT THE NEW LAW ALSO CONTAINS NEGATIVES FOR MUNICIPAL BONDS
c2fc020g FOR PEOPLE WHO PAY THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX THE PRIVATE PURPOSE VARIETY IS NOW SUBJECT TO TAX
c2fc020h AND THE LOWERING OF TAX BRACKETS MEANS THAT THE SHELTER FEATURE IS LESS CRUCIAL THAN IT ONCE WAS
c2fc020i CABLE OPERATORS ARE WILLING PARTICIPANTS IN THE PRICE CUTTING PROGRAMS

c2fc020m IT'S ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO A SOCIETY WHEN IT GROWS OLD AND TRIES TO KEEP THE STATUS QUO INSTEAD OF LETTING ITS MORE CREATIVE INSTINCTS TAKE OVER
c2fc020n ALTHOUGH TUCKER IS SET IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES MR. LUCAS MAKES IT CLEAR HE THINKS THE FILM'S SUBJECT IS CURRENT AND QUITE PERSONAL
c2fc020o AS FOR THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY IT IS SEEKING TO RETAIN THE REMAINING LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST BANK INTRUSIONS
c2fc020p INVESTMENT BANKERS WARN OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND SELF DEALING IF COMMERCIAL BANKERS ARE ALLOWED TO COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH THEM
c2fc020q DESPITE THE BANKERS' DIRE WARNINGS THEY ARGUE THE CIRCUMSTANCES DON'T CALL FOR CHANGING THE HALF CENTURY OLD SYSTEM

c2fc0210 ACCORDING TO RECENT INDUSTRY STATISTICS THE POST'S DAILY CIRCULATION IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND THE CHRONICLE'S APPROXIMATES FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
c2fc0212 EVEN THE TRADITIONAL GREEN STAMP MIGHT BECOME A THING OF THE PAST
c2fc0213 IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMERS' COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE TASK OF PASTING IN TRADING STAMPS SPERRY AND HUTCHINSON COMPANY IS TESTING ELECTRONIC GREEN STAMPS IN SUPERMARKETS IN CONNECTICUT
c2fc0214 INSTEAD OF RECEIVING PAPER STAMPS CONSUMERS HAND THE CASHIER A PLASTIC CARD
c2fc0215 THE CARD IS INSERTED INTO A TERMINAL THAT AUTOMATICALLY RECORDS THE NUMBER OF STAMPS ACCRUED
c2fc0216 AND COMPARING GENERAL PARTNERS' FEES CAN BE TRICKY
c2fc0217 SPONSORS COMPETE PRIMARILY ON THE CURRENT YIELDS THEY'RE ABLE TO OFFER

c2hc020z WHEN YOU TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE THE CRASH AND ADD ON THIS DECLINE IT CAUSES ME A LOT OF CONCERN
c2hc0211 TSAI IS PROBABLY TORN BETWEEN TWO GOALS BUILDING A WORLD CLASS FINANCIAL COMPANY AND MAKING MONEY PERSONALLY SAYS MARTIN SOSNOFF OF ATALANTA SLASH SOSNOFF CAPITAL
c2hc0212 WHILE THE GOALS AREN'T MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE HE ADDS THEY MAY NOT ALWAYS BE ATTAINABLE AT THE SAME TIME
c2hc0213 BUT USING OUTSIDE HELP CAN INVOLVE LARGE AND SOMETIMES SUBTLE COSTS
c2hc0214 MOST TEMPORARY WORKERS AREN'T AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO BE MOTIVATED BY TRADITIONAL INCENTIVES LIKE PAY INCREASES PROMOTIONS OR APPEALS TO CORPORATE LOYALTY
c2hc0215 THUS MANAGERS MUST USE MORE IMAGINATIVE MEANS EXPERTS SAY TO ENSURE THAT PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE DON'T SUFFER
c2hc0216 NEITHER THE QUIET NOR THE MELLOWING OF ATTITUDES HOWEVER HAS THAWED OFFICIAL RELATIONS BETWEEN JORDAN AND ISRAEL
c2hc0217 WITH POLITICAL DIVISIONS IN ISRAEL AND AN ADMINISTRATION NEARING THE END OF ITS TERM IN THE U. S. FEW PEOPLE HOLD OUT MUCH HOPE FOR RECENT PEACE INITIATIVES

c2hc0219 ARE THE DANES SUPPOSED TO LISTEN SERIOUSLY TO SECRETARY SHULTZ WHEN HE TELLS THEM THAT THE PROPOSED DANISH POLICY TOWARD SHIPS UNDERCUTS THE NUCLEAR DETERRENCE OF NATO
c2hc021a WASN'T MR. SHULTZ JUST IN MOSCOW WORKING ON YET ANOTHER NUCLEAR TREATY

c2hc021e ONLY THREE OF THE THRIFT'S TEN DIRECTORS WERE UP FOR RE ELECTION
c2hc021f THE SHOCKER WAS THAT THE JUDGE HAD ORDERED A HUGE DAMAGE PAYMENT BEFORE CARBIDE'S LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES IF ANY HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED AT A TRIAL
c2hc021g AT FIRST GLANCE AT LEAST THE DECISION SEEMS TO VIOLATE ANY DEFENDANT'S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO PRESENT EVIDENCE AND TO CROSS EXAMINE WITNESSES AGAINST IT
c2hc021h A CARBIDE SPOKESMAN HAS DECRIED THE RULING AS A JUDGMENT AND DECREE WITHOUT TRIAL
c2hc021i AFTER ALL THAT MR. HAY DOESN'T WANT THE HOUSE TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF RIGHT WING PARAMILITARY CRAZIES
c2hc021j SINGER MICHAEL JACKSON HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE PROPERTY AS HAS THE KING OF LIECHTENSTEIN ACCORDING TO MR. HAY
c2hc021k MR. WALSH SAYS PREVIEWS IS ALSO GETTING CALLS FROM COMPANIES LOOKING FOR A CORPORATE RETREAT
c2hc021l AMONG ITS REASONS PROVIGO'S BOARD CITED THE FACT THAT UNIGESCO AND EMPIRE ARE ALREADY PROVIGO'S MAIN SHAREHOLDERS AND SAID THE OFFER WON'T CHANGE THEIR EFFECTIVE CONTROL
c2hc021m PROVIGO ALSO SAID HOLDERS WHO DON'T ACCEPT THE OFFER STILL WILL BE ABLE TO SELL THEIR SHARES ON THE OPEN MARKET
c2hc021n THE BOARD CONCLUDED THAT WHETHER OR NOT A HOLDER ACCEPTS THE OFFER IS A PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISION

c2hc021s BROWNING FERRIS HAS HAD ITS SHARE OF PROBLEMS WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES
c2hc021t IT TOOK THE COMPANY MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS TO ACQUIRE PERMITS FOR A WASTE FACILITY NOW BEING BUILT IN RURAL COLORADO

c2hc021v I DON'T HAVE ANY MAGIC FORMULA
c2hc021w BUT HE SAID HE WILL ATTEND SOME LOCAL MEETINGS WHERE RESIDENTS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DISCUSS ISSUING PERMITS
c2hc021x I THINK I CAN SET A TONE FOR HOW OUR EMPLOYEES RELATE TO SUCH ISSUES HE SAID
c2hc021y EVER SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO MR. GORBACHEV HAS SOUGHT TO INCREASE FOREIGN TRADE'S MEAGER SHARE OF THE SOVIET ECONOMY
c2hc021z RATHER THAN SIMPLY IMPORT MORE WESTERN GOODS HE WOULD LIKE TO OBTAIN THE MACHINERY AND KNOW HOW TO ENABLE THE SOVIETS TO MAKE THE GOODS THEMSELVES
c2hc0220 TO DO SO HE OPENED UP THE ECONOMY TO FOREIGN CAPITAL AND EQUIPMENT BY PERMITTING JOINT VENTURES
c2hc0221 THAT FIGHT WHILE REMARKABLE FOR ITS BITTERNESS TYPIFIES THE CORE PROBLEM IN THE NATIONWIDE PUSH TO CONTAIN MEDICAL COSTS WHO GETS LESS
c2hc0222 DOCTORS WANT TO MAINTAIN THEIR AUTHORITY AND THEIR INCOMES
c2hc0223 HOSPITALS ARE FIGHTING TO HANG ONTO REVENUE MORE THAN A THIRD OF WHICH COMES FROM MEDICARE
c2hc0224 AND PATIENTS DON'T WANT TO SEE SERVICES DECREASE
c2hc0225 BUT THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM NOW CONSUMES ABOUT ONE MILLION DOLLARS A MINUTE AND ALL AGREE IT NEEDS TAMING
c2hc0226 U. S. OFFICIALS SAID SOVIET REFUSAL TO DESTROY A SIBERIA RADAR COMPLEX IS PROMPTING THE WHITE HOUSE TO CONSIDER EXPANDING STRATEGIC ARMS PROGRAMS
c2hc0227 THE U. S. CONTENDS THE RADAR VIOLATES THE A. B. M. PACT
c2hc0228 THE STEPS BEING WEIGHED INCLUDE REVERSING THE PLANNED DISMANTLING OF THREE NUCLEAR SUBMARINES AND ACCELERATING SPACE WEAPONS TESTING

c2hc022d WHETHER THE EAST GERMAN GOVERNMENT CAN EXTRICATE ITSELF FROM ITS CURRENT CRISIS IS A QUESTION THAT CONFOUNDS WESTERN ANALYSTS
c2hc022e HOWEVER MOST AGREE THAT EAST GERMANY IS LURCHING TOWARD CRISIS
c2hc022f ABOVE ALL IT IS A CRISIS THAT THE NATION'S AGING LEADERS SEEM UTTERLY CONFUSED BY
c2hc022g WITH THE REST OF THE EAST BLOC SWEPT UP IN A TIDE OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CHANGE EAST BERLIN HAS STEADFASTLY STUCK TO ITS OLD WAYS
c2hc022h YET THE GOVERNMENT LED BY SEVENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD ERICH HONECKER APPEARS ALMOST INCAPABLE OF GOVERNING AT A TIME THAT DEMANDS NEW IDEAS
c2ic0201 FIRST OF ALL THE POLICY CONSERVATIVES WILL PURSUE THEIR UNFINISHED AGENDA OF DEREGULATION IN AREAS FROM FINANCIAL SERVICES TO REGULATION AS A DRAG ON U. S. INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
c2ic0202 THEY SAY THE ADMINISTRATION MISSED ITS CHANCE AND ALLOWED ITS DEREGULATORY CAMPAIGN TO BE ALL BUT ABORTED BY CONTROVERSY OVER ANNE GORSUCH AND JIM WATT
c2ic0203 THEY THINK THEIR GENERAL CASE IN THIS AREA IS OVERWHELMING
c2ic0204 THEY WILL GIVE IT NEW APPLICATIONS AND CARRY IT TO NEW FORUMS
c2ic0205 I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO RATION HEALTH CARE AS THE BRITISH DO HE SAYS
c2ic0206 HIGH TECHNOLOGY HEART SURGERY FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BE GIVEN TO YOUNG PATIENTS EXPECTED TO HAVE A PROMISING RESPONSE
c2ic0207 BUT WITH AN OLD VERY SICK PATIENT WITH MULTIPLE DISEASES WE MIGHT NOT DO THE PROCEDURE
c2ic0208 WITH MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF REPORTED STOCK ASSETS THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS CONTROL A SIZABLE CHUNK OF PENSION ASSETS AND PRIVATE PORTFOLIOS
c2ic0209 INVESTMENT ADVISERS TEND TO BE SMALL PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS WHOSE OWNERS MANAGE THE PORTFOLIOS
c2ic020a THEY ARE OFTEN KNOWN FOR MAVERICK INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND HIGH FEES
c2ic020b THE U. S. WOULDN'T BE SORRY TO SEE THE SOVIET PEACE OFFENSIVE FALTER
c2ic020c SOME THINK THE RUSSIANS HOPE THEIR EFFORT WILL FOMENT DISCORD IN PAKISTAN WHERE OPPOSITION PARTIES MAY USE IT TO OPPOSE GOVERNMENT POLICY OF HARBORING AFGHAN GUERRILLAS

c2ic020n THE UNCERTAINTY OVER THE OWNERSHIP ISSUE IS COMPLICATING AN ARRAY OF OTHER IMPORTANT DECISIONS INCLUDING THE FINANCING AND MANAGEMENT FOR WHATEVER COMPANY FINALLY EMERGES
c2ic020o THE LEVEL OF LABOR OWNERSHIP AFFECTS THE AMOUNT OF FINANCING THE COMPANY WILL NEED AND POSSIBLY WHO PROVIDES IT
c2ic020p IF THE LABOR GROUPS END UP WITH A CONTROLLING INTEREST THEY INTEND TO PICK THEIR OWN BOSSES
c2ic020q ACCORDING TO THE AGREEMENT TOYOTA WILL SUPPLY V. W. WITH NECESSARY MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY AND PARTS FOR PRODUCTION
c2ic020r LOCAL CONTENT IS TARGETED TO EXCEED FIFTY PERCENT BY THE END OF NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE BUT BOTH COMPANIES WILL TRY TO BOOST THAT RATIO EVEN FURTHER
c2ic020s AT LEAST SIXTY PERCENT OF THE PARTS HAVE TO BE MADE WITHIN THE E. C. FOR MOTOR VEHICLES TO BE MARKETED IN THE REGION WITHOUT TARIFFS
c2ic020t ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THEY HADN'T EXPECTED LOWER OPERATING PROFITS FOR THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRIES GROUP AND FOR THE BROADCASTING SEGMENT
c2ic020u WESTINGHOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD ANALYSTS THAT OPERATING PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIES GROUP FELL FIFTEEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT HURT IN PART BY WEAK RESULTS IN CANADIAN OPERATIONS
c2ic020v A SHARP DROP IN OPERATING PROFIT FROM THE BROADCASTING GROUP'S PRODUCTION COMPANY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS OVERALL FOR THAT SEGMENT
c2ic020w RESIDENTS HERE SAY ONE MIGHT EXPECT SUCH GOINGS ON IN MIAMI OR FORT LAUDERDALE BUT NOT IN SLEEPY WINTER HAVEN
c2ic020x THE BIGGEST SCAM IN RECENT MEMORY WAS A RABBIT BREEDING SCHEME THAT LURED LOCALS INTO BUYING AND RAISING BUNNIES FOR PELTS IN THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES
c2ic020y NOW THEY ARE BRACING FOR THE AFTERSHOCKS OF S. H. OIL'S FALL
c2ic020z BUT MANY CLUBS DON'T OFFER TEAM SPORTS AT ALL
c2ic0210 THIS REFLECTS A GERMANIC DISTASTE FOR THE IDEA OF COMPETITION AS A GOAL IN ITSELF AND FOR THE AMERICAN PENCHANT FOR TURNING PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING INTO A CONTEST
c2ic0211 BEAUTY PAGEANTS ARE RARE HERE HOSTILE TAKEOVERS ARE UNKNOWN IN THE BUSINESS WORLD AND THE GOVERNMENT STILL FIXES PRICES ON MANY PRODUCTS AND STRICTLY REGULATES STORE HOURS
c2ic0212 HE ALSO WAS EMPHATIC ABOUT KEEPING BURGER KING
c2ic0213 I WANT TO SAY WITHOUT QUALIFICATION THAT BURGER KING IS CENTRAL TO PILLSBURY
c2ic0214 IT WAS TRUE YESTERDAY IT IS TRUE TODAY AND IT REMAINS TRUE FOR THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIC FUTURE HE SAID
c2ic0215 IN THE TWO SELECTED AREAS THE STATE WILL ALLOW PROCUREMENT AND RETAIL PRICES TO RISE TO WHAT THE OPEN MARKET DEMANDS
c2ic0216 THE SUBSIDY FOR CONSUMERS IS MEANT TO REDUCE THE STRAIN ON URBAN RESIDENTS
c2ic0217 FARMERS OF COURSE WILL GET HIGHER PRICES FOR THEIR GRAIN FROM THE MARKET WHICH IN TURN SHOULD INDUCE THEM TO INCREASE PRODUCTION
c2ic0218 GRAIN PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT CHINA HAS FALTERED IN RECENT YEARS IN PART BECAUSE STATE PROCUREMENT PRICES WERE TOO LOW
c2ic0219 THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT INVITES FOREIGN NEWSPAPERS TO PRINT THE TRUTH ABOUT SINGAPORE
c2ic021a BUT WHY HAS THE ASIAN WALL STREET JOURNAL REFUSED TO PRINT GOVERNMENT REPLIES CORRECTING ERRORS AND BIASES IN ITS REPORTING
c2ic021b WHY DOES IT DENY THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT THE SIMPLE RIGHT OF REPLY
c2ic021c MEANWHILE AUDI SET UP A BONUS PLAN TO ENCOURAGE DEALERSHIP SALESPEOPLE TO SELL AUDI EIGHTY AND NINETY CARS NEWER MODELS THAT CARRY FAR LESS GENEROUS INCENTIVES
c2ic021d UNDER THE BONUS PLAN AUDI PROMISED TO GIVE SALES PEOPLE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS EVERY TIME THEY SOLD AN EIGHTY OR NINETY MODEL

c2ic021r BUT MR. MCCONNELL IN RESPONSE SAID HE BELIEVED THAT AT LEAST SEVEN THOUSAND UNITS HAD BEEN LOST SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY
c2ic021s IN HIS EXPERIENCE OWNERS DO REGISTER UNITS EVEN IF THEY ARE EXEMPT FROM RENT CONTROL PRECISELY TO ESTABLISH THAT THEY ARE EXEMPT
c2ic021t THOSE WHO WORK FOR THE RENT BOARD WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A SUBSTANTIAL LOSS OF HOUSING HE SAID
c2ic021u EVERYBODY ELSE IN TOWN WILL TELL YOU OTHERWISE
c2ic021v THIS PLAN DUBBED THE MIYAZAWA PLAN IN HONOR OF JAPANESE FINANCE MINISTER KIICHI MIYAZAWA SOUNDS JOLLY ON THE SURFACE
c2ic021w BANKS WOULD HAVE A NEW MARKET AT THE I. M. F. WHERE THEY COULD PEDDLE UNWANTED DEBTOR NATION PAPER
c2ic021x THE DEBTOR NATIONS WOULD HAVE A NEW SOURCE OF FINANCING OF SORTS
c2ic021y THEY COULD RESCHEDULE A PORTION OF THEIR DEBTS WITH A POSSIBILITY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OF REPAYING SOME IN THEIR OWN CURRENCIES
c2ic021z THE I. M. F. WOULD HAVE A MORE CENTRAL ROLE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL DEBT
c2ic0220 AND THE JAPANESE WOULD BECOME CLOSE PARTNERS OF THE I. M. F. IN DEBT MANAGEMENT
c2ic0221 AS MANY EMPLOYERS ARE THE BIG BROKER IS ENDING A DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN THAT PROVIDED PENSIONS BASED ON SALARY AND YEARS OF SERVICE
c2ic0222 DEFINED BENEFITS HAVE BECOME COSTLIER TO ADMINISTER BECAUSE OF NEW TAX AND ACCOUNTING RULES
c2ic0223 AND EMPLOYEES TEND TO SEE A PENSION YEARS AWAY AS LESS VALUABLE THAN A PAYMENT HERE AND NOW
c2ic0224 ALL OF THIS HAS LED MORE FIRMS TO ADOPT DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN WHICH SALARY AND SERVICE DETERMINE ANNUAL PAYMENTS TO AN EMPLOYEE'S ACCOUNT
c2ic0225 THE BOND ISSUANCE PROVISION IS PART OF A CONTROVERSIAL TAX BILL
c2ic0226 AS OF LATE YESTERDAY THAT BILL APPEARED STALLED ANALYSTS SAID
c2ic0227 IF CONGRESS DOESN'T ACT SOON THE TREASURY WON'T BE ABLE TO ISSUE NEW LONG TERM BONDS UNTIL EARLY NEXT YEAR
c2ic0228 A. YES WITHOUT QUESTION
c2ic0229 IT'S MY SENSE THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY COULD TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION WITH ABSOLUTE IMPUNITY
c2ic022a AND THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE
c2ic022b NOW I AM CERTAIN THAT THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CAN TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION AND GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE THEY'RE SMARTER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON
c2ic022c THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THOSE PEOPLE
c2ic022d BUT I THINK THAT THE ACTIONS HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON CONDUCT
c2ic022e ONE OF THE AFFINITY CARDS THAT CHEMICAL BANK DROPPED WAS MARKETED TO ALUMNI OF NEW YORK UNIVERSITY
c2ic022f WE WERE SATISFIED WITH THE PROGRAM WHILE IT WAS RUNNING SAID ROBERT CUNNINGHAM DIRECTOR OF ALUMNI RELATIONS AT N. Y. U.
c2ic022g BUT IT ENDED AT CHEMICAL'S SUGGESTION
c2jc0201 IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ACCIDENT BRITISH AIRWAYS BEGAN CHECKING ITS OTHER JETS FOR CRACKS
c2jc0202 IT FOUND CRACKS MORE THAN TWO INCHES LONG IN THIRTY SIX ENGINES ALL OF WHICH IT REMOVED FROM PLANES
c2jc0203 EVEN AFTER SPARE JETS WERE INSTALLED THIRTEEN JETS WERE GROUNDED
c2jc0204 ACTUALLY HIS MARATHON STAND UP SAVED THE SHOW
c2jc0205 FOR ON THAT LONELY NIGHT LAST OCTOBER SEVENTEENTH THE TALK SHOW HOST HAD NO ONE TO TALK TO
c2jc0206 NONE OF HIS GUESTS HAD SHOWN UP
c2jc0207 COMPANIES WITH SALES OF LESS THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS DOUBLED IN NUMBER DURING NINETEEN SEVENTY TO EIGHTY THREE ACCOUNTING FOR NEARLY ALL THE INCREASE
c2jc0208 CONSEQUENTLY THE BIGGER COMPANIES' SHARE DECREASED MARKEDLY
c2jc0209 IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE OUT OF FOUR HAD SALES EXCEEDING ONE MILLION DOLLARS WHILE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE THIS SHARE HAD FALLEN TO ONE IN SIX
c2jc020a MEANWHILE THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE INCREASED PRESSURE ON THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON THE JAPANESE FOR VIOLATING THE SEMICONDUCTOR ACCORD
c2jc020b THE PANEL APPROVED A RESOLUTION CALLING ON THE PRESIDENT TO RESPOND TO JAPANESE VIOLATIONS OF THE PACT
c2jc020c THE RESOLUTION IS EXPECTED TO BE CONSIDERED ON THE SENATE FLOOR EITHER TODAY OR NEXT WEEK
c2jc020d UNDER THE FEDERAL RAILWAY LABOR ACT THE REJECTION TRIGGERED A THIRTY DAY COOLING OFF PERIOD THAT STARTED YESTERDAY
c2jc020e IF AMERICAN AND ITS UNION CAN'T REACH A SETTLEMENT BY THEN THE AIRLINE CAN IMPOSE ITS LATEST CONTRACT OFFER OR LOCK OUT ITS FLIGHT ATTENDANTS
c2jc020f THE ASSOCIATION OF PROFESSIONAL FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ALSO WOULD BE FREE TO STRIKE BUT IT HAS SAID IT DOESN'T PLAN TO DO SO
c2jc020g BOTH THE I. M. F. AND WORLD BANK MISSIONS ARE LIKELY TO BE CRITICAL OF BRAZIL'S CURRENT POLICIES
c2jc020h INFLATION IN BRAZIL IS RUNNING AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT AND LABOR UNREST IS INCREASING
c2jc020i THERE ALSO IS A GROWING INTERNAL DISPUTE ABOUT MR. FUNARO'S MANAGEMENT OF THE ECONOMY
c2jc020j IT WAS KIND OF HARD TO IGNORE THE SORRY PERFORMANCE OF THE MANAGEMENT GORDON WOULD RECALL
c2jc020k THEY WERE ABLE MEN YET THEY MANAGED TO DO A WRETCHED JOB
c2jc020l HIS ULTIMATE PURPOSE OBTAIN TOTAL CONTROL OF THE COMPANY BY THE TRUST
c2jc020m IN THE MEANTIME HE WANTED TO FIND A WAY TO GET MORE OF THE COMPANY'S VALUE INTO THE HANDS OF SHAREHOLDERS

c2jc020t MORE TRADITIONAL ACADEMICS SAY MANY OF THE NEWER JOURNALS ARE MERELY PLATFORMS FOR MARGINAL SCHOLARS TO WRITE ON TRIVIAL TOPICS
c2jc020u I'M DIMLY AWARE THAT THEY'RE OUT THERE SAYS RICHARD ULLMAN PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY AND A FORMER EDITOR OF FOREIGN POLICY MAGAZINE
c2jc020v BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE WHO PUBLISH SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT WOULDN'T WANT TO PUBLISH IN THE LEADING JOURNALS
c2jc020w SUSPICIOUS MERRILL LYNCH CALLED IRWIN L. JACOBS THE MINNEAPOLIS INVESTOR WHOSE VENTURES INCLUDE MINSTAR
c2jc020x MR. JACOBS TOLD THE BROKERAGE THAT THE ORDER WAS A FAKE AND DISMISSED IT AS A PRANK
c2jc020y THE NEXT DAY A SIMILAR WIRE WAS SENT THIS ONE SEEKING TO SELL ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SHARES OF CONTROL DATA
c2jc020z ALLSTATE A UNIT OF CHICAGO BASED SEARS ROEBUCK AND COMPANY SAID TALKS COLLAPSED LAST WEEK AFTER FORD PULLED OUT
c2jc0210 FORD SAID IT NO LONGER WANTED TO CONTINUE NEGOTIATING AN ALLSTATE SPOKESMAN SAID FRIDAY
c2jc0211 DEARBORN MICHIGAN BASED FORD DECLINED TO COMMENT OTHER THAN TO SAY THAT THE TWO COMPANIES JOINTLY AGREED TO END THE DISCUSSIONS
c2jc0212 NEITHER SIDE ELABORATED
c2jc0213 THE MOVIE IS DRAWN FROM THE NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF GABY BRIMMER THEN THE THIRTY FOUR YEAR OLD DAUGHTER OF JEWISH REFUGEES IN MEXICO CITY
c2jc0214 SHE WAS RAISED BY LOVING PARENTS IN UPPER MIDDLE CLASS COMFORT BUT SHE WAS CRIPPLED FROM BIRTH
c2jc0215 MS. BRIMMER GREW UP ABLE TO MOVE ONLY HER LEFT FOOT
c2jc0216 SHE COULDN'T TALK OR WALK OR WIPE HER FOREHEAD
c2jc0217 NOTHING BESIDES THAT MOBILE FOOT WORKED EXCEPT HER BRAIN WHICH WORKED OVERTIME
c2jc0218 AT NINE OH THREE A. M. THE FIRST OF THE DAY'S BIG NEWS HEADLINES HITS THE SCREEN
c2jc0219 U. S.
c2jc021a COMMERCE UNDER SECRETARY SAYS DOLLAR IS NOW COMPETITIVE A NEWS MONITOR REPORTS
c2jc021b THE AUCTION HOUSE SAID THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE TOP TEN ART WORKS ALL SOLD FOR MORE THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS EACH
c2jc021c RECORDS WERE SET FOR SIX ARTISTS INCLUDING MARC CHAGALL CLAUDE MONET AND PIERRE AUGUSTE RENOIR
c2jc021d THE TOP PRICE WAS FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A RENOIR PAINTING OF A YOUNG WOMAN
c2jc021e ABANDONING A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT COST A UTILITY A BUNDLE
c2jc021f BUT STATE REGULATORS APPROVED A RATE INCREASE TO COVER THE COSTS
c2jc021g NOW THE I. R. S. RULES THAT THE UTILITY IS ALSO ENTITLED TO A LOSS DEDUCTION FOR THE COSTS OF THE ABANDONED PLANT
c2jc021h MOST FINANCIAL MARKETS REACTED COOLLY TO FRIDAY'S DEFICIT AGREEMENT
c2jc021i THE DOLLAR AND BOND PRICES FELL WHILE STOCKS EDGED HIGHER IN THE FINANCIAL HOUR OF TRADING
c2jc021j THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS CLOSED UP NINE POINT FOUR FIVE AT ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE POINT OH EIGHT
c2jc021k FOREIGN STOCK MARKETS GENERALLY GAINED
c2jc021l AT THE CARNEGIE ROCHESTER CONFERENCE IN PITTSBURGH EARLIER THIS MONTH BENNETT MCCALLUM OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY DISCUSSED A DIFFERENT RULE
c2jc021m THE GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT HAS GROWN AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF ABOUT THREE PERCENT FOR YEARS
c2jc021n SO THE MONETARY AUTHORITY WOULD WANT TO SUPPLY ENOUGH BASE MONEY CURRENCY PLUS BANK RESERVES TO SUPPORT THAT GROWTH
c2jc021o THE TARGET FOR GROWTH OF THE BASE WOULD BE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BASE AND G. N. P. OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS
c2jc021p THERE WOULD ALSO BE A PROVISION TO ADJUST THE BASE WHEN G. N. P. DEPARTS FROM ITS TARGET PATH
c2jc021q MR. MCCALLUM TRIED THE RULE WITH A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC MODELS AND FOUND IT PRODUCED SMOOTHER G. N. P. GROWTH WITH ESSENTIALLY NO INFLATION
c2jc021r THE LEGITIMATE RIGHT OF GOVERNMENT TO PRESCRIBE PENALTIES FOR FRAUD IS WELL UNDERSTOOD IN LAW WHEN A GOOD OR SERVICE IS INVOLVED
c2jc021s LAWS AGAINST FRAUD SHOULD BE NO LESS APPLICABLE TO PLANT CLOSINGS OR MASS LAYOFFS
c2jc021t IN SHORT GOVERNMENT SHOULD SEEK TO ENSURE THAT EMPLOYERS LIVE UP TO THEIR LEGAL OBLIGATIONS AND SHOULD PROVIDE FOR LEGAL REMEDIES WHEN THEY DO NOT
c2jc021u MR. TANAKA WAS AMONG THE FIRST SCIENTISTS TO RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL OF SUPERCONDUCTORS WHICH ARE SUBSTANCES THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRICITY WITH NO RESISTANCE AND THUS NO LOSS OF POWER
c2jc021v IF MADE PRACTICAL THEY COULD BRING SPECTACULAR CHANGES TO ALMOST ANY ELECTRICAL PRODUCT OR PROCESS
c2jc021w THAT COULD MEAN VASTLY FASTER AND MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS SUCH AS COMPUTERS CARS AND HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES
c2jc021x BUT UNTIL THE RECENT BREAKTHROUGH SUPERCONDUCTORS HAD TO BE CHILLED TO A HOPELESSLY LOW TEMPERATURE TO WORK SO EXCEPT FOR A FEW APPLICATIONS THERE REALLY WAS NO TECHNOLOGY
c2jc021y FOR THE MOST PART THE LONDON BANKS SET UP BY JAPANESE SECURITIES HOUSES AND THE SECURITIES COMPANIES SET UP BY JAPANESE BANKS ARE SMALL BY WORLD STANDARDS
c2jc021z NOMURA BANK HAS ASSETS OF ABOUT TWO BILLION POUNDS THREE POINT FOUR TWO BILLION DOLLARS
c2jc0220 JAPANESE BANKS' SECURITIES SUBSIDIARIES TYPICALLY HAVE ASSETS OF BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS TO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS ACCORDING TO A BANK OF ENGLAND SURVEY
c2jc0221 THE SALE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS NOT WIDELY EXPECTED
c2jc0222 BUT DESPITE THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE THE NEWS HAD LITTLE NET EFFECT ON THE SECONDARY MARKET FOR NEW YORK BONDS
c2jc0223 THERE ISN'T ENOUGH SUPPLY FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE SIZABLE OFFERING TO HAVE MUCH IMPACT EXPLAINED ONE TRADER
c2jc0224 MR. JACOBS DESCRIBED THE CURRENT EIGHT PERCENT INFLATION RATE AS HIGHER THAN DESIRABLE
c2jc0225 HE ALSO SAID IT MIGHT ACCELERATE FURTHER OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS BEFORE LEVELING OFF
c2jc0226 BUT THE FINANCIAL SECRETARY SAID HE HOPED THAT PRICE INCREASES LIKE THE LABOR SHORTAGE WOULD EASE IF THE LOCAL ECONOMY SLOWS AS HE HAS PREDICTED
c2jc0227 THAT'S WHAT WALL COVERING INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES DO
c2jc0228 LAST WEEKEND AT AN INDUSTRY GATHERING HERE NEARLY FIFTY OF THEM DRESSED UP IN FABRICS DESIGNED FOR BEDROOM BATHROOM AND OTHER HOUSEHOLD WALLS
c2jc0229 THEN AFTER A FEW ROUNDS OF DRINKS THEY STAGED A FASHION SHOW FOR HUNDREDS OF GUESTS
c2jc022a ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COMMODITY COIN IS INDONESIA HURT BY WEAK PETROLEUM PRICES AND LAGGING AGRICULTURAL GROWTH
c2jc022b INDONESIA HAS BOOSTED NON OIL EXPORTS THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME OIL AND GAS WILL ACCOUNT FOR LESS THAN HALF THE NATION'S EXPORT EARNINGS
c2jc022c THE BRIGHT SPOT CONTINUES TO BE MANUFACTURED EXPORTS LED BY PLYWOOD AND TEXTILES
c2jc022d STOCK PRICES CLIMBED IN ACTIVE TRADING
c2jc022e VOLUME ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE TOTALED ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION SHARES
c2jc022f ADVANCING ISSUES ON THE BIG BOARD WERE AHEAD OF DECLINERS EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY SIX TO SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY
c2jc022g IN SOME CASES CONSUMERS CAN CHOOSE AMONG AS MANY AS FIFTEEN GENERIC VERSIONS OF A BRAND NAME PRESCRIPTION DRUG
c2jc022h WE AREN'T PICKING ON ANY PARTICULAR MANUFACTURER SAID IRENE CARO ACTING F. D. A. DISTRICT DIRECTOR IN LOS ANGELES
c2jc022i WE ARE JUST SELECTING A RANGE OF MANUFACTURERS WHO ARE MAKING THESE GENERIC PRODUCTS
c2kc0201 MR. HENKEL A FORMER ATLANTA ATTORNEY WAS APPOINTED TO THE THREE MEMBER BANK BOARD BY PRESIDENT REAGAN NOVEMBER SEVENTH
c2kc0202 HE HAS PUT ALL HIS BUSINESS INTERESTS THAT HAD TRANSACTIONS WITH THRIFTS INCLUDING THOSE WITH LOANS FROM LINCOLN INTO A BLIND TRUST
c2kc0203 HE HAS ALSO SAID HE INTENDS TO RECUSE HIMSELF FROM BANK BOARD VOTES SPECIFICALLY INVOLVING THRIFTS HE HAS DEALT WITH INCLUDING LINCOLN
c2kc0204 DREXEL BURNHAM HAD A MAJOR ROLE IN EVERY TRANSACTION UNDER INVESTIGATION IN THE IVAN BOESKY INSIDER TRADING CASE AN ANALYSIS SHOWS
c2kc0205 IT HAS ALSO EMERGED THAT BOESKY HIMSELF WAS A MAJOR INVESTOR IN EVERY INSTANCE
c2kc0206 BOESKY MEANWHILE APPEARS TO HAVE SPEEDED UP THE LIQUIDATION OF HIS OPERATIONS
c2kc0207 BORG WARNER EASED THREE EIGHTHS TO FORTY ONE AND THREE EIGHTHS ON SIX HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SHARES
c2kc0208 <NOISE> MINSTAR AND BEAR STEARNS ENTERED INTO AN OPTION AGREEMENT FOR THE POSSIBLE PURCHASE OF THREE MILLION TWENTY NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED BORG WARNER SHARES
c2kc0209 THE PURCHASES WOULD BOOST MINSTAR'S BORG WARNER STAKE TO EIGHT POINT FIVE PERCENT
c2kc020a YESTERDAY G. A. F. ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS ACQUIRED A NINE POINT SIX PERCENT INVESTMENT STAKE IN BORG WARNER
c2kc020b PALO VERDE IS OWNED BY SEVEN ELECTRICAL UTILITIES INCLUDING PHOENIX BASED A. Z. P. GROUP INCORPORATED'S ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY
c2kc020c THE PLANT'S SECOND UNIT IS ALREADY SHUT DOWN FOR ROUTINE MAINTENANCE AND ISN'T SCHEDULED TO RESUME OPERATIONS UNTIL EARLY MARCH A SPOKESMAN FOR THE OPERATORS SAID
c2kc020d A THIRD PALO VERDE UNIT IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION
c2kc020e SODA ASH IS YET ANOTHER TEST
c2kc020f THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION IS PUTTING CONSIDERABLE CLOUT BEHIND INCREASING EXPORTS OF THIS UNSUNG MINERAL USED FOR MAKING GLASS AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS
c2kc020h AND M. I. T. I. OFFICIALS AREN'T SURE THEY WANT TO KILL OFF DOMESTIC SUPPLIERS TO MAKE U. S. PRODUCERS HAPPY
c2kc020i MR. GITTIS SAID THE LAWSUITS WOULD HAVE LITTLE INFLUENCE ON THE RESPONSE OF REVLON'S BOARD TO THE TENDER OFFER
c2kc020j HE SAID MACANDREWS AND FORBES RATHER THAN REVLON IS BORROWING THE MONEY NEEDED TO ACQUIRE REVLON AND TAKE IT PRIVATE
c2kc020k WE'RE SELLING EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF NOTES IN A PRIVATE PLACEMENT HE SAID
c2kc020l IF WE WERE USING REVLON ASSETS THE SUITS COULD BE TROUBLESOME
c2kc020m THE COMPANY SAID JOY TECHNOLOGIES' PROJECTED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WON'T BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS DUE BEFORE JUNE TWENTIETH NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
c2kc020n AS A RESULT JOY TECHNOLOGIES WILL HAVE TO SELL A NUMBER OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS
c2kc020o THE COMPANY PROJECTED SALES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT OF FIVE HUNDRED TEN MILLION DOLLARS AND IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE OF FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS
c2kc020p HER HUSBAND CARL IS A PENNSYLVANIA STATE TROOPER
c2kc020q TO AVOID ANY CONFLICT OVER SALARIES THEY PUT HER FORTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR ANNUAL INCOME IN A SAVINGS ACCOUNT AND LIVE OFF HIS THIRTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR INCOME
c2kc020r I LOOK AT IT AS SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT WE MADE TOGETHER SAYS MR. STEPHENS
c2kc020s MORE TRADITIONAL ACADEMICS SAY MANY OF THE NEWER JOURNALS ARE MERELY PLATFORMS FOR MARGINAL SCHOLARS TO WRITE ON TRIVIAL TOPICS
c2kc020u BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE WHO PUBLISH SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT WOULDN'T WANT TO PUBLISH IN THE LEADING JOURNALS
c2kc020v EXPORTS LOST TO TOUGHER COMPETITION ABROAD AND MORE IMPORTS INTO THE U. S. MARKET HAVE CAUSED MANY FARMERS TO ABANDON THEIR TRADITIONAL FAITH IN FREE TRADE
c2kc020w FROM SUGAR LONG PROTECTED TO WHEAT TO FLOWERS FARMERS ARE DEMANDING THAT BORDERS BE CLOSED
c2kc020x THE LOSERS PARTICULARLY IN SUGAR ARE MANY OF THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES WHOSE DESPERATE ECONOMIES THE U. S. GOVERNMENT IS OTHERWISE TRYING TO SALVAGE
c2kc020y BUT EVEN INVESTORS WHO DO ALL THE HOMEWORK AND REQUEST ALL THE DOCUMENTS SHOULDN'T FEEL TOO COMPLACENT
c2kc020z THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MUST BE UPDATED EVERY YEAR SO NEW PROSPECTUSES ARE ISSUED ANNUALLY
c2kc0210 SOMETIMES ONLY THE PER SHARE DATA TABLE CHANGES BUT OFTEN OTHER REVISIONS ARE INCLUDED
c2kc0211 DAVID FLEISCHER AN ANALYST AT PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES THINKS TENNECO BY NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETEEN NINETY ONE COULD EARN EIGHT DOLLARS A SHARE FROM EXISTING OPERATIONS
c2kc0212 THAT WOULD BE A SIXFOLD INCREASE FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PROFIT WHICH HE PUTS AT ONLY ONE DOLLAR AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS A SHARE
c2kc0213 TENNECO STANDS TO BENEFIT GREATLY FROM A PICK UP AT ITS OIL AND GAS AND FARM EQUIPMENT BUSINESSES HE SAYS
c2kc0214 JUDGE BORK'S LIKELY DEFEAT IS A TURNING POINT IN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY PRECISELY BECAUSE IT IS NOT A TURNING POINT
c2kc0215 NEVER BEFORE HAS A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BEEN DEFEATED BECAUSE OF HIS GENERAL APPROACH TO THE CONSTITUTION
c2kc0216 THIS DEFEAT CONSOLIDATES THE APPROACH TO THE CONSTITUTION THAT HAS BEEN FOLLOWED FOR THE PAST FIFTY YEARS
c2kc0217 NEARLY ALL THE GAINERS WERE COMPANIES THAT SELL TO CUSTOMERS OTHER THAN PERSONAL COMPUTER MAKERS
c2kc0218 <NOISE> INTEL THE BIGGEST O. T. C. SEMICONDUCTOR MAKER AND BY FAR THE LARGEST ELECTRONICS ISSUE ON NASDAQ FELL ONE QUARTER TO TWENTY THREE AND THREE QUARTERS
c2kc0219 L. S. I. LOGIC ANOTHER BIG SEMICONDUCTOR CONCERN WITH SOME P. C. MAKING CUSTOMERS WAS UNCHANGED AT SEVEN AND THREE QUARTERS
c2kc021b I FIND LITTLE EVIDENCE OF THE WIDESPREAD PESSIMISM YOU SAY ABOUNDS ON THE NATION'S FARMS
c2kc021c IN FACT THE FARM CRISIS NOW EASING HAS TAUGHT OUR FOOD AND FIBER GROWERS TO BE TOUGHER BUSINESSMEN MORE COST CONSCIOUS AND BETTER PLANNERS
c2kc021d MANY ALREADY ANTICIPATE A DECREASE IN FEDERAL FARM SUBSIDIES AND ARE FINE TUNING THEIR OPERATIONS TO BE PROFITABLE WITHOUT THEM
c2kc021e THEY SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR THESE EFFORTS
c2kc021f FEDERAL POLICY MAKERS WRESTLING WITH BUDGET DEFICITS HAVE MUCH TO LEARN FROM THEM
c2kc021g <NOISE> IN A RECENT PAPER PRESENTED TO FELLOW LOBBYISTS MISS FARTHING EXPLAINED HOW TO GET LEVERAGE FROM SUCH A PROGRAM
c2kc021h SHE RECOMMENDED SENDING INVITATIONS FIRST TO MEMBERS OF TAX WRITING COMMITTEES AND TO SENIOR OPINION MOLDERS WHO LOBBY THEIR COLLEAGUES
c2kc021i SHE ALSO SUGGESTED SENDING A CAR TO FETCH THE LAWMAKER WHOSE GOODWILL YOU WISH TO STIMULATE AND MAKING SURE THAT THE CHECK IS ISSUED PROMPTLY
c2kc021j FOR A SHIP OR MISSILE GUIDED BY THE WRONG TIME SIGNAL THAT LITTLE GAP COULD MEAN ARRIVING AT THE WRONG DESTINATION
c2kc021k IF WE LET THE DIFFERENCE GROW SAYS MR. MCCARTHY WE COULD RUN INTO PROBLEMS OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS
c2kc021l IT MIGHT BE NOON BY ATOMIC TIME BUT DARK OUTSIDE
c2kc021m AT ONE POINT LAST SUMMER MR. WALSH EVEN CONSIDERED SEEKING MAJOR INDICTMENTS BEFORE SOME PRINCIPAL WITNESSES IN CONGRESS'S IRAN CONTRA HEARINGS WERE HEARD
c2kc021n BLEARY EYED PROSECUTORS STAYED UP UNTIL DAWN SEVERAL DAYS IN A ROW DRAFTING A FLURRY OF PROPOSED CHARGES MOTIONS AND OTHER COURT FILINGS REQUESTED BY MR. WALSH
c2kc021o THE IDEA WAS TO SEEK INDICTMENTS QUICKLY BEFORE MESSRS.
c2kc021p POINDEXTER AND NORTH AND OTHERS TESTIFIED UNDER CONGRESSIONAL GRANTS OF LIMITED IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION
c2kc021q DOW PRESIDENT FRANK POPOFF SAID IN A STATEMENT THAT BOTH PRICE AND VOLUME INCREASES BOLSTERED EARNINGS
c2kc021r THE COMPANY'S STRONG COST CONTAINMENT EFFORTS ALSO HELPED
c2kc021s COSTS REMAIN STABLE VOLUME HAS INCREASED AND THERE IS NO WEAKNESS APPARENT IN EITHER THE PRODUCT LINES OR GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS MR. POPOFF SAID
c2kc021u HE CARRIED SIX IN TEN WHITE PROTESTANTS SEVEN IN TEN CATHOLICS AND ABOUT AN EQUAL PROPORTION OF THE STATE'S JEWISH VOTERS
c2kc021v SENATOR GORE WHO MADE A STRONG PITCH FOR JEWISH SUPPORT DURING THE CAMPAIGN BY STRESSING HIS SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL WON FEWER THAN ONE IN FIVE JEWISH VOTES
c2kc021x UNDER THE ARRANGEMENTS UNVEILED THIS WEEK HE IS TO SUCCEED MR. ESCAMEZ AS CHAIRMAN OF THE NEW BANCO CENTRAL BANESTO COMBINATION IN THREE YEARS
c2kc021y MR. ESCAMEZ FOR HIS PART WILL BECOME CHAIRMAN OF THE BANK'S ADVISORY COMMITTEE A NON EXECUTIVE ROLE
c2kc021z STILL MS. FREEDMAN NOTICED THAT A BRIGHT FORECAST FOR HIRING ISN'T NECESSARILY ALL GOOD NEWS
c2kc0220 THE INCREASING USE OF LABOR MAY BE BECAUSE OF A TREMENDOUS BOOM IN THE OUTPUT OF GOODS AND SERVICES SHE SAID
c2kc0221 BUT IT ALSO MIGHT BE BECAUSE YOU AREN'T IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY WITH WHICH YOU USE THE LABOR FORCE THE PRODUCTIVITY
c2kc0222 BLAME IT ON A LOCAL NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN ORDINANCE THAT BARS WORLDLY EMPLOYMENT OR BUSINESS EXCEPT WORKS OF NECESSITY AND CHARITY ON SUNDAY
c2kc0224 THE PURPOSE OF THE BAN IS TO KEEP DOWN TRAFFIC THE TOWN SAYS
c2kc0225 INDEED NO CHANGES ARE LIKELY SOON BECAUSE THE WHOLESALERS AND SMALL RETAILERS THAT BENEFIT FROM THE EXISTING SYSTEM ARE WELL ORGANIZED BACKERS OF THE RULING LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY
c2kc0226 THE JAPANESE DEBATE ON THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM BEGAN ONLY RECENTLY
c2kc0227 EVEN AFTER A CONSENSUS IS REACHED NEW LEGISLATION MAY HAVE TO BE DRAFTED AND ENACTED
c2kc0228 FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS THE KURDS HAVE STRUGGLED TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT KURDISTAN IN A TERRITORY THAT STRADDLES PARTS OF TURKEY IRAQ AND IRAN
c2kc0229 LIKE THE PALESTINIANS THE WORLD'S TWENTY MILLION KURDS SHARE A RELIGION A CULTURE A LANGUAGE AND A PASSION FOR AUTONOMY
c2kc022a NEARLY HALF LIVE IN TURKEY WHICH REFUSES EVEN TO RECOGNIZE THEM AS A DISTINCT NATIONAL MINORITY AND REFERS TO THEM ONLY AS MOUNTAIN TURKS
c2kc022b THOUGH THE KURDS OUTNUMBER THE PALESTINIANS BY A RATIO OF FIVE TO ONE THE KURDISH CAUSE HAS ATTRACTED LITTLE GLOBAL ATTENTION
c2kc022c THE PLAN WAS CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED TO CONFORM WITH THE CONSERVATIVE GRADUALIST PRINCIPLES OF THE EXISTING BAKER PLAN DEVISED BY FORMER SECRETARY BAKER
c2kc022d THAT APPROACH FEATURES A MENU OF OPTIONS BY WHICH BANKS AND DEBTOR COUNTRIES MIGHT VOLUNTARILY NEGOTIATE NEW LOANS OR REDUCTIONS IN DEBT
c2kc022e THE PLAN OPPOSES GOVERNMENT ASSUMPTION OF BANK RISK OR BAILOUTS AND STRESSES NEW LENDING OVER DEBT RELIEF
c2kc022f MR. JORDAN WAS AWARDED DAMAGES OF NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS AND A PUNITIVE AWARD OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
c2kc022h THE APPEALS COURT UPHELD THE LOWER COURT IN OCTOBER NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
c2kc022i ONE OF THE AFFINITY CARDS THAT CHEMICAL BANK DROPPED WAS MARKETED TO ALUMNI OF NEW YORK UNIVERSITY
c2kc022j WE WERE SATISFIED WITH THE PROGRAM WHILE IT WAS RUNNING SAYS ROBERT CUNNINGHAM DIRECTOR OF ALUMNI RELATIONS AT N. Y. U.
c2lc0201 OCTOBER'S CONTRACTING FOR TRANSPORTATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRUCTION SURGED THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT TO AN ANNUAL RATE OF FORTY FOUR POINT THREE NINE BILLION DOLLARS FOLLOWING A SHARP DECLINE IN SEPTEMBER
c2lc0202 THE RALLY IN PUBLIC WORKS CONSTRUCTION DOMINATED THE MONTH'S ACTIVITY
c2lc0203 MODEST GAINS IN HOME BUILDING WERE OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION
c2lc0204 ME AND THE GUY I WAS WITH WERE FISHING ALONG SOME WEEDS NOT GETTING MUCH OF ANYTHING COOK RECALLS
c2lc0205 I HOOKED A BIG ONE AND IT GOT AWAY
c2lc0206 I THOUGHT UH OH THAT'S IT FOR ME TODAY
c2lc0207 COUPLE MINUTES LATER THE EIGHT POUNDER HIT
c2lc0208 JUST LUCKY I GUESS
c2lc0209 THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED HOWEVER
c2lc020a A PROVISION IN THE SPENDING BILL REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST ONE THIRD OF THE REPAIR AND OVERHAUL WORK ON SHIPS BE DONE LOCALLY AT THEIR HOME PORTS
c2lc020b THAT MAKES IT A BIG DEAL FOR TODD AND LOCKHEED MR. DICKS SAYS REFERRING TO TWO PUGET SOUND SHIPYARDS
c2lc020c STILL EVEN A MAJOR SLOWDOWN COULD PERMIT HEFTY FUND GROWTH CONSIDERING LAST YEAR'S RECORD GROSS SALES TO INVESTORS OF TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS
c2lc020d NET NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX SALES AFTER REDEMPTIONS WERE ONE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS
c2lc020e A SPOT SURVEY HERE SHOWED THAT MANY EXECUTIVES THINK BOTH GROSS AND NET SALES FOR THE INDUSTRY THIS YEAR MAY RANGE FROM FLAT TO DOWN THIRTY PERCENT FROM LAST YEAR
c2lc020f THE SALE COMPLETES ALLIED'S PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED DIVESTITURE OF ITS ELECTRONICS AND INSTRUMENTATION BUSINESSES
c2lc020g THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM INVOLVED THE SALE OF SEVEN COMPANIES INCLUDING NEPTUNE
c2lc020h PROCEEDS WILL BE USED TO REDUCE DEBT CONTINUE THE COMPANY'S SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM AND FOR INVESTMENTS
c2lc020i BUT FIRST CITY WOUND UP MAKING LOANS TO SOME OF THE MOST TROUBLED ENERGY CONCERNS IN TEXAS
c2lc020j IT CONCENTRATED MORE THAN A THIRD OF ITS ENERGY LENDING IN THE ROLLERCOASTER FORTUNES OF SERVICE AND DRILLING COMPANIES
c2lc020k WHEN THE ENERGY INDUSTRY WAS GROWING THE LOANS WERE HIGHLY PROFITABLE OFTEN YIELDING TWO OR THREE POINTS OVER THE PRIME RATE
c2lc020l BUT WHEN OIL PRICES FELL IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO AND EXPLORATION SLOWED THESE COMPANIES SOME OF THEM YOUNG AND HIGHLY LEVERAGED QUICKLY RAN INTO PROBLEMS
c2lc020m IN THE END THERE IS LITTLE THE U. S. CAN DO TO CONTROL EVENTS IN SOUTH AFRICA
c2lc020n THE ADMINISTRATION'S SIX YEAR CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT POLICY DESIGNED TO COAX PRETORIA TOWARDS DISMANTLING APARTHEID DIDN'T SUCCEED
c2lc020o AND SANCTIONS IN THE SHORT RUN WON'T DAMAGE SOUTH AFRICA'S SELF RELIANT ECONOMY
c2lc020p BUT THE PERCEPTION OF INACTION HAS DIPLOMATIC COSTS FOR THE U. S. AND SO FOR THE TIME BEING SANCTIONS SEEM TO BE THE BEST BET
c2lc020q BUT EVEN INVESTORS WHO DO ALL THE HOMEWORK AND REQUEST ALL THE DOCUMENTS SHOULDN'T FEEL TOO COMPLACENT
c2lc020r THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MUST BE UPDATED EVERY YEAR SO NEW PROSPECTUSES ARE ISSUED ANNUALLY
c2lc020s SOMETIMES ONLY THE PER SHARE DATA TABLE CHANGES BUT OFTEN OTHER REVISIONS ARE INCLUDED
c2lc020t JUDGE BORK HOWEVER ASKED FOR NONE OF THIS
c2lc020u BORK DOESN'T WANT A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN MR. GARMENT CONCEDES
c2lc020v I TOLD HIM I WOULD DO THIS UNLESS HE VIOLENTLY OBJECTED
c2lc020w HE SAID YOU'RE A FREE AGENT GARMENT
c2lc020x DO WHAT YOU THINK IS APPROPRIATE
c2lc020y FACED WITH MOUNTING COMPLAINTS THE STATE DEPARTMENT REMOVED FIDELITY FROM ITS LIST OF RECOMMENDED WAREHOUSES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND THE COMPANY DECIDED TO SHUT ITS DOORS
c2lc020z UNDER GOVERNMENT SUPERVISION FIDELITY MOVED THE DIPLOMATS' GOODS TO OTHER WAREHOUSING COMPANIES
c2lc0210 IT HAS OFTEN PROVED IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER GOODS WERE DAMAGED OR LOST BY FIDELITY OR RATHER BY THE WAREHOUSES THEY WERE MOVED TO AFTER FIDELITY FOLDED
c2lc0211 SURELY THE PRODUCER PRICE INDEX HAS BEEN GIVING THE FED NO CAUSE TO WORRY ABOUT INFLATION
c2lc0212 WHEN THE DECEMBER STATISTIC IS RELEASED THIS WEEK ANALYSTS BELIEVE IT WILL SHOW LITTLE OR NO CHANGE FOR THE THIRD MONTH IN A ROW
c2lc0213 ENERGY PRICES STABILIZED AND REBATES HELD DOWN AUTO PRICES
c2lc0214 OFFICIALS HERE ARE SEEING RED OVER VIDEOTAPE CASSETTES
c2lc0215 THEY'RE SEEING GREEN AND BLUE TOO
c2lc0216 BUT WHAT THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE IS BLACK THE COLOR OF THE STANDARD VIDEOCASSETTE CONTAINER IN MANY COUNTRIES
c2lc0217 THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIRTY SHARE INDEX CLOSED SEVEN POINT ONE POINTS LOWER AT ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTEEN POINT FOUR THE DAY'S BEST LEVEL
c2lc0218 VOLUME TOTALED A MODEST FOUR HUNDRED FORTY TWO POINT NINE MILLION SHARES DOWN FROM FIVE HUNDRED NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION FRIDAY
c2lc0219 THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX CLOSED THIRTEEN POINT TWO POINTS LOWER AT ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY POINT TWO
c2lc021a A BETTER TEST OF THE FED'S INTENTIONS PROBABLY WON'T COME UNTIL MID MARCH MR. MAUDE SAID
c2lc021b AT THAT TIME TECHNICAL FACTORS NOTABLY CORPORATE TAX PAYMENTS WILL PLACE RENEWED UPWARD PRESSURE ON THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE
