c2hc021e ONLY THREE OF THE THRIFT'S TEN DIRECTORS WERE UP FOR RE ELECTION
c2hc021f THE SHOCKER WAS THAT THE JUDGE HAD ORDERED A HUGE DAMAGE PAYMENT BEFORE CARBIDE'S LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES IF ANY HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED AT A TRIAL
c2hc021g AT FIRST GLANCE AT LEAST THE DECISION SEEMS TO VIOLATE ANY DEFENDANT'S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO PRESENT EVIDENCE AND TO CROSS EXAMINE WITNESSES AGAINST IT
c2hc021h A CARBIDE SPOKESMAN HAS DECRIED THE RULING AS A JUDGMENT AND DECREE WITHOUT TRIAL
c2hc021i AFTER ALL THAT MR. HAY DOESN'T WANT THE HOUSE TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF RIGHT WING PARAMILITARY CRAZIES
c2hc021j SINGER MICHAEL JACKSON HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE PROPERTY AS HAS THE KING OF LIECHTENSTEIN ACCORDING TO MR. HAY
c2hc021k MR. WALSH SAYS PREVIEWS IS ALSO GETTING CALLS FROM COMPANIES LOOKING FOR A CORPORATE RETREAT
c2hc021l AMONG ITS REASONS PROVIGO'S BOARD CITED THE FACT THAT UNIGESCO AND EMPIRE ARE ALREADY PROVIGO'S MAIN SHAREHOLDERS AND SAID THE OFFER WON'T CHANGE THEIR EFFECTIVE CONTROL
c2hc021m PROVIGO ALSO SAID HOLDERS WHO DON'T ACCEPT THE OFFER STILL WILL BE ABLE TO SELL THEIR SHARES ON THE OPEN MARKET
c2hc021n THE BOARD CONCLUDED THAT WHETHER OR NOT A HOLDER ACCEPTS THE OFFER IS A PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISION
c2hc021o OTHER LARGE AND MIDSIZED CARS POSTING GOOD SCORES WERE THE MERCURY SABLE THE OLDSMOBILE DELTA EIGHTY EIGHT AND THE BUICK REGAL
c2hc021q THEY WERE THE BUICK PARK AVENUE THE CHRYSLER NEW YORKER AND THE RENAULT MEDALLION
c2hc021r ALL THE CARS TESTED WERE FOUR DOOR VEHICLES EXCEPT THE BUICK
c2hc021s BROWNING FERRIS HAS HAD ITS SHARE OF PROBLEMS WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES
c2hc021t IT TOOK THE COMPANY MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS TO ACQUIRE PERMITS FOR A WASTE FACILITY NOW BEING BUILT IN RURAL COLORADO
c2hc021u MR. RUCKELSHAUS CAUTIONED THAT HE ISN'T SURE HE CAN SPEED UP SUCH EFFORTS
c2hc021v I DON'T HAVE ANY MAGIC FORMULA
c2hc021w BUT HE SAID HE WILL ATTEND SOME LOCAL MEETINGS WHERE RESIDENTS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DISCUSS ISSUING PERMITS
c2hc021x I THINK I CAN SET A TONE FOR HOW OUR EMPLOYEES RELATE TO SUCH ISSUES HE SAID
c2hc021y EVER SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO MR. GORBACHEV HAS SOUGHT TO INCREASE FOREIGN TRADE'S MEAGER SHARE OF THE SOVIET ECONOMY
c2hc021z RATHER THAN SIMPLY IMPORT MORE WESTERN GOODS HE WOULD LIKE TO OBTAIN THE MACHINERY AND KNOW HOW TO ENABLE THE SOVIETS TO MAKE THE GOODS THEMSELVES
c2hc0220 TO DO SO HE OPENED UP THE ECONOMY TO FOREIGN CAPITAL AND EQUIPMENT BY PERMITTING JOINT VENTURES
c2hc0221 THAT FIGHT WHILE REMARKABLE FOR ITS BITTERNESS TYPIFIES THE CORE PROBLEM IN THE NATIONWIDE PUSH TO CONTAIN MEDICAL COSTS WHO GETS LESS
c2hc0222 DOCTORS WANT TO MAINTAIN THEIR AUTHORITY AND THEIR INCOMES
c2hc0223 HOSPITALS ARE FIGHTING TO HANG ONTO REVENUE MORE THAN A THIRD OF WHICH COMES FROM MEDICARE
c2hc0224 AND PATIENTS DON'T WANT TO SEE SERVICES DECREASE
c2hc0225 BUT THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM NOW CONSUMES ABOUT ONE MILLION DOLLARS A MINUTE AND ALL AGREE IT NEEDS TAMING
c2hc0226 U. S. OFFICIALS SAID SOVIET REFUSAL TO DESTROY A SIBERIA RADAR COMPLEX IS PROMPTING THE WHITE HOUSE TO CONSIDER EXPANDING STRATEGIC ARMS PROGRAMS
c2hc0227 THE U. S. CONTENDS THE RADAR VIOLATES THE A. B. M. PACT
c2hc0228 THE STEPS BEING WEIGHED INCLUDE REVERSING THE PLANNED DISMANTLING OF THREE NUCLEAR SUBMARINES AND ACCELERATING SPACE WEAPONS TESTING
c2hc0229 HE RETURNED HOME IN TIME FOR HIS FIFTEENTH BIRTHDAY IN MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
c2hc022a AS PART OF THE TREATMENT HE ATTENDED FIFTEEN WEEKS OF AFTER CARE FIVE DAYS A WEEK
c2hc022b HE ALSO WAS REQUIRED TO GO TO NINETY MEETINGS OF ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS OR NARCOTICS ANONYMOUS IN NINETY DAYS
c2hc022c HE DID SO WITH ENTHUSIASM HE DROPPED DRUG USING FRIENDS AND IT SEEMED OUR TROUBLES SOON WOULD BE BEHIND US
c2hc022d WHETHER THE EAST GERMAN GOVERNMENT CAN EXTRICATE ITSELF FROM ITS CURRENT CRISIS IS A QUESTION THAT CONFOUNDS WESTERN ANALYSTS
c2hc022e HOWEVER MOST AGREE THAT EAST GERMANY IS LURCHING TOWARD CRISIS
c2hc022f ABOVE ALL IT IS A CRISIS THAT THE NATION'S AGING LEADERS SEEM UTTERLY CONFUSED BY
c2hc022g WITH THE REST OF THE EAST BLOC SWEPT UP IN A TIDE OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CHANGE EAST BERLIN HAS STEADFASTLY STUCK TO ITS OLD WAYS
c2hc022h YET THE GOVERNMENT LED BY SEVENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD ERICH HONECKER APPEARS ALMOST INCAPABLE OF GOVERNING AT A TIME THAT DEMANDS NEW IDEAS
c2ic0201 FIRST OF ALL THE POLICY CONSERVATIVES WILL PURSUE THEIR UNFINISHED AGENDA OF DEREGULATION IN AREAS FROM FINANCIAL SERVICES TO REGULATION AS A DRAG ON U. S. INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
c2ic0202 THEY SAY THE ADMINISTRATION MISSED ITS CHANCE AND ALLOWED ITS DEREGULATORY CAMPAIGN TO BE ALL BUT ABORTED BY CONTROVERSY OVER ANNE GORSUCH AND JIM WATT
c2ic0203 THEY THINK THEIR GENERAL CASE IN THIS AREA IS OVERWHELMING
c2ic0204 THEY WILL GIVE IT NEW APPLICATIONS AND CARRY IT TO NEW FORUMS
c2ic0205 I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO RATION HEALTH CARE AS THE BRITISH DO HE SAYS
c2ic0206 HIGH TECHNOLOGY HEART SURGERY FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BE GIVEN TO YOUNG PATIENTS EXPECTED TO HAVE A PROMISING RESPONSE
c2ic0207 BUT WITH AN OLD VERY SICK PATIENT WITH MULTIPLE DISEASES WE MIGHT NOT DO THE PROCEDURE
c2ic0208 WITH MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF REPORTED STOCK ASSETS THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS CONTROL A SIZABLE CHUNK OF PENSION ASSETS AND PRIVATE PORTFOLIOS
c2ic0209 INVESTMENT ADVISERS TEND TO BE SMALL PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS WHOSE OWNERS MANAGE THE PORTFOLIOS
c2ic020a THEY ARE OFTEN KNOWN FOR MAVERICK INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND HIGH FEES
c2ic020b THE U. S. WOULDN'T BE SORRY TO SEE THE SOVIET PEACE OFFENSIVE FALTER
c2ic020c SOME THINK THE RUSSIANS HOPE THEIR EFFORT WILL FOMENT DISCORD IN PAKISTAN WHERE OPPOSITION PARTIES MAY USE IT TO OPPOSE GOVERNMENT POLICY OF HARBORING AFGHAN GUERRILLAS
c2ic020d MEANWHILE THE WAR CONTINUES TO DAMAGE THE SOVIETS' THIRD WORLD RELATIONS WHILE DRAINING THEIR ECONOMY AND MILITARY
c2ic020e DELTA IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE THAT IT WILL BECOME THE NEW OFFICIAL CARRIER FOR WALT DISNEY WORLD IN ORLANDO FLORIDA
c2ic020f THE AIRLINE IS CALLING TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT THE MOST IMPORTANT MARKETING ENDEAVOR IN DELTA'S RECENT HISTORY
c2ic020g FOR RIVAL EASTERN AIRLINES A UNIT OF TEXAS AIR CORPORATION IT MAY BE YET ANOTHER LOSS OF PRESTIGE
c2ic020h TWO GUNMEN CRITICALLY WOUNDED A TURKISH EMBASSY EMPLOYEE IN WEST BEIRUT POLICE SAID
c2ic020i DETAILS WEREN'T DISCLOSED
c2ic020j SEPARATELY A CHRISTIAN LEADER SAID FIVE KIDNAPPED FOREIGNERS INCLUDING THREE AMERICANS AND ANGLICAN ENVOY TERRY WAITE WERE BEING HELD BY SYRIAN TROOPS IN LEBANON
c2ic020k MR. TSAI'S BIG RUN AT SETTING UP A FINANCIAL SERVICES EMPIRE STARTED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WHEN HE BOUGHT CONTROL OF ASSOCIATED MADISON COMPANIES A SMALL INSURER
c2ic020l WORKING SEVEN DAYS A WEEK FROM A TINY POOL OF CAPITAL MR. TSAI BUILT UP ASSOCIATED MADISON'S INVESTMENT PROFITS AT LEAST FIVEFOLD
c2ic020m THEN HE SOLD THE COMPANY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE TO GREENWICH CONNECTICUT BASED AMERICAN CAN JOINING THE CAN COMPANY AS AN EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT
c2ic020n THE UNCERTAINTY OVER THE OWNERSHIP ISSUE IS COMPLICATING AN ARRAY OF OTHER IMPORTANT DECISIONS INCLUDING THE FINANCING AND MANAGEMENT FOR WHATEVER COMPANY FINALLY EMERGES
c2ic020o THE LEVEL OF LABOR OWNERSHIP AFFECTS THE AMOUNT OF FINANCING THE COMPANY WILL NEED AND POSSIBLY WHO PROVIDES IT
c2ic020p IF THE LABOR GROUPS END UP WITH A CONTROLLING INTEREST THEY INTEND TO PICK THEIR OWN BOSSES
c2ic020q ACCORDING TO THE AGREEMENT TOYOTA WILL SUPPLY V. W. WITH NECESSARY MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY AND PARTS FOR PRODUCTION
c2ic020r LOCAL CONTENT IS TARGETED TO EXCEED FIFTY PERCENT BY THE END OF NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE BUT BOTH COMPANIES WILL TRY TO BOOST THAT RATIO EVEN FURTHER
c2ic020s AT LEAST SIXTY PERCENT OF THE PARTS HAVE TO BE MADE WITHIN THE E. C. FOR MOTOR VEHICLES TO BE MARKETED IN THE REGION WITHOUT TARIFFS
c2ic020t ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THEY HADN'T EXPECTED LOWER OPERATING PROFITS FOR THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRIES GROUP AND FOR THE BROADCASTING SEGMENT
c2ic020u WESTINGHOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD ANALYSTS THAT OPERATING PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIES GROUP FELL FIFTEEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT HURT IN PART BY WEAK RESULTS IN CANADIAN OPERATIONS
c2ic020v A SHARP DROP IN OPERATING PROFIT FROM THE BROADCASTING GROUP'S PRODUCTION COMPANY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS OVERALL FOR THAT SEGMENT
c2ic020w RESIDENTS HERE SAY ONE MIGHT EXPECT SUCH GOINGS ON IN MIAMI OR FORT LAUDERDALE BUT NOT IN SLEEPY WINTER HAVEN
c2ic020x THE BIGGEST SCAM IN RECENT MEMORY WAS A RABBIT BREEDING SCHEME THAT LURED LOCALS INTO BUYING AND RAISING BUNNIES FOR PELTS IN THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES
c2ic020y NOW THEY ARE BRACING FOR THE AFTERSHOCKS OF S. H. OIL'S FALL
c2ic020z BUT MANY CLUBS DON'T OFFER TEAM SPORTS AT ALL
c2ic0210 THIS REFLECTS A GERMANIC DISTASTE FOR THE IDEA OF COMPETITION AS A GOAL IN ITSELF AND FOR THE AMERICAN PENCHANT FOR TURNING PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING INTO A CONTEST
c2ic0211 BEAUTY PAGEANTS ARE RARE HERE HOSTILE TAKEOVERS ARE UNKNOWN IN THE BUSINESS WORLD AND THE GOVERNMENT STILL FIXES PRICES ON MANY PRODUCTS AND STRICTLY REGULATES STORE HOURS
c2ic0212 HE ALSO WAS EMPHATIC ABOUT KEEPING BURGER KING
c2ic0213 I WANT TO SAY WITHOUT QUALIFICATION THAT BURGER KING IS CENTRAL TO PILLSBURY
c2ic0214 IT WAS TRUE YESTERDAY IT IS TRUE TODAY AND IT REMAINS TRUE FOR THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIC FUTURE HE SAID
c2ic0215 IN THE TWO SELECTED AREAS THE STATE WILL ALLOW PROCUREMENT AND RETAIL PRICES TO RISE TO WHAT THE OPEN MARKET DEMANDS
c2ic0216 THE SUBSIDY FOR CONSUMERS IS MEANT TO REDUCE THE STRAIN ON URBAN RESIDENTS
c2ic0217 FARMERS OF COURSE WILL GET HIGHER PRICES FOR THEIR GRAIN FROM THE MARKET WHICH IN TURN SHOULD INDUCE THEM TO INCREASE PRODUCTION
c2ic0218 GRAIN PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT CHINA HAS FALTERED IN RECENT YEARS IN PART BECAUSE STATE PROCUREMENT PRICES WERE TOO LOW
c2ic0219 THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT INVITES FOREIGN NEWSPAPERS TO PRINT THE TRUTH ABOUT SINGAPORE
c2ic021a BUT WHY HAS THE ASIAN WALL STREET JOURNAL REFUSED TO PRINT GOVERNMENT REPLIES CORRECTING ERRORS AND BIASES IN ITS REPORTING
c2ic021b WHY DOES IT DENY THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT THE SIMPLE RIGHT OF REPLY
c2ic021c MEANWHILE AUDI SET UP A BONUS PLAN TO ENCOURAGE DEALERSHIP SALESPEOPLE TO SELL AUDI EIGHTY AND NINETY CARS NEWER MODELS THAT CARRY FAR LESS GENEROUS INCENTIVES
c2ic021d UNDER THE BONUS PLAN AUDI PROMISED TO GIVE SALES PEOPLE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS EVERY TIME THEY SOLD AN EIGHTY OR NINETY MODEL
c2ic021e LAW OFFICIALS FROM THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND SEVERAL STATES HAVE SAID THEY ARE OPENING INQUIRIES INTO AUDI'S REBATES
c2ic021f COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION WHICH ALSO REQUIRES APPROVAL BY REGULATORY AGENCIES AND HOLDERS OF OTHER SECURITIES MUST BE COMPLETED NO LATER THAN NOVEMBER THIRTIETH UNDER THE AGREEMENT
c2ic021g IF IT DOESN'T CLOSE AS EXPECTED BY SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH THE CASH PRICE PAID BY NOVA FOR EACH POLYSAR COMMON SHARE WOULD RISE TEN CANADIAN CENTS
c2ic021h THE CASH PRICE WOULD RISE FIFTEEN MORE CENTS TO FOURTEEN CANADIAN DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS A SHARE IF THE TRANSACTION CLOSES IN NOVEMBER THE SIDES SAID
c2ic021i COMMISSION CHAIRMAN DENNIS PATRICK HOWEVER SAID HE THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE ECONOMIC INCENTIVES TO KEEP INDEPENDENT STATIONS ON CABLE SYSTEMS AS LONG AS THEY WERE POPULAR
c2ic021j MR. PATRICK ALSO SAID THAT ONE ORIGINAL CONCERN THAT NETWORK OWNERSHIP MIGHT IMPEDE THE GROWTH OF CABLE AS A COMPETITOR OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE
c2ic021k HOUSEHOLDS WITH CABLE T. V. HAVE INCREASED TO MORE THAN FORTY MILLION FROM ABOUT TEN MILLION IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX
c2ic021l THE FIRM NEITHER WOULD DISCLOSE HOW MUCH MONEY IT EXPECTS TO SAVE NOR WOULD SAY HOW MANY LAYOFFS MIGHT RESULT
c2ic021m IN SOME CASES WHERE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS WERE MANAGING MORE THAN ONE FUND THEY PROBABLY WILL STAY ON MR. GLASSMAN SAID
c2ic021n BUT HE SAID NO FINAL DECISIONS HAD BEEN MADE
c2ic021o BUT NOW THE COMPANY'S MARKETING ATTENTION IS SHIFTING COMPLETELY AWAY FROM THE SAMURAI IN FAVOR OF THE TWO NEW VEHICLES
c2ic021p SUZUKI OFFICIALS SAY THEY WILL SPEND ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ADVERTISING BY YEAR END TO LAUNCH THE SWIFT AND THE SIDEKICK
c2ic021q BY APRIL SUZUKI EXPECTS TO SHIP TWENTY THOUSAND OF THE CARS AND THIRTY THOUSAND OF THE SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES TO THE U. S.
c2ic021r BUT MR. MCCONNELL IN RESPONSE SAID HE BELIEVED THAT AT LEAST SEVEN THOUSAND UNITS HAD BEEN LOST SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY
c2ic021s IN HIS EXPERIENCE OWNERS DO REGISTER UNITS EVEN IF THEY ARE EXEMPT FROM RENT CONTROL PRECISELY TO ESTABLISH THAT THEY ARE EXEMPT
c2ic021t THOSE WHO WORK FOR THE RENT BOARD WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A SUBSTANTIAL LOSS OF HOUSING HE SAID
c2ic021u EVERYBODY ELSE IN TOWN WILL TELL YOU OTHERWISE
c2ic021v THIS PLAN DUBBED THE MIYAZAWA PLAN IN HONOR OF JAPANESE FINANCE MINISTER KIICHI MIYAZAWA SOUNDS JOLLY ON THE SURFACE
c2ic021w BANKS WOULD HAVE A NEW MARKET AT THE I. M. F. WHERE THEY COULD PEDDLE UNWANTED DEBTOR NATION PAPER
c2ic021x THE DEBTOR NATIONS WOULD HAVE A NEW SOURCE OF FINANCING OF SORTS
c2ic021y THEY COULD RESCHEDULE A PORTION OF THEIR DEBTS WITH A POSSIBILITY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OF REPAYING SOME IN THEIR OWN CURRENCIES
c2ic021z THE I. M. F. WOULD HAVE A MORE CENTRAL ROLE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL DEBT
c2ic0220 AND THE JAPANESE WOULD BECOME CLOSE PARTNERS OF THE I. M. F. IN DEBT MANAGEMENT
c2ic0221 AS MANY EMPLOYERS ARE THE BIG BROKER IS ENDING A DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN THAT PROVIDED PENSIONS BASED ON SALARY AND YEARS OF SERVICE
c2ic0222 DEFINED BENEFITS HAVE BECOME COSTLIER TO ADMINISTER BECAUSE OF NEW TAX AND ACCOUNTING RULES
c2ic0223 AND EMPLOYEES TEND TO SEE A PENSION YEARS AWAY AS LESS VALUABLE THAN A PAYMENT HERE AND NOW
c2ic0224 ALL OF THIS HAS LED MORE FIRMS TO ADOPT DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN WHICH SALARY AND SERVICE DETERMINE ANNUAL PAYMENTS TO AN EMPLOYEE'S ACCOUNT
c2ic0225 THE BOND ISSUANCE PROVISION IS PART OF A CONTROVERSIAL TAX BILL
c2ic0226 AS OF LATE YESTERDAY THAT BILL APPEARED STALLED ANALYSTS SAID
c2ic0227 IF CONGRESS DOESN'T ACT SOON THE TREASURY WON'T BE ABLE TO ISSUE NEW LONG TERM BONDS UNTIL EARLY NEXT YEAR
c2ic0228 A. YES WITHOUT QUESTION
c2ic0229 IT'S MY SENSE THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY COULD TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION WITH ABSOLUTE IMPUNITY
c2ic022a AND THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE
c2ic022b NOW I AM CERTAIN THAT THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CAN TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION AND GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE THEY'RE SMARTER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON
c2ic022c THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THOSE PEOPLE
c2ic022d BUT I THINK THAT THE ACTIONS HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON CONDUCT
c2ic022e ONE OF THE AFFINITY CARDS THAT CHEMICAL BANK DROPPED WAS MARKETED TO ALUMNI OF NEW YORK UNIVERSITY
c2ic022f WE WERE SATISFIED WITH THE PROGRAM WHILE IT WAS RUNNING SAID ROBERT CUNNINGHAM DIRECTOR OF ALUMNI RELATIONS AT N. Y. U.
c2ic022g BUT IT ENDED AT CHEMICAL'S SUGGESTION
c2jc0201 IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ACCIDENT BRITISH AIRWAYS BEGAN CHECKING ITS OTHER JETS FOR CRACKS
c2jc0202 IT FOUND CRACKS MORE THAN TWO INCHES LONG IN THIRTY SIX ENGINES ALL OF WHICH IT REMOVED FROM PLANES
c2jc0203 EVEN AFTER SPARE JETS WERE INSTALLED THIRTEEN JETS WERE GROUNDED
c2jc0204 ACTUALLY HIS MARATHON STAND UP SAVED THE SHOW
c2jc0205 FOR ON THAT LONELY NIGHT LAST OCTOBER SEVENTEENTH THE TALK SHOW HOST HAD NO ONE TO TALK TO
c2jc0206 NONE OF HIS GUESTS HAD SHOWN UP
c2jc0207 COMPANIES WITH SALES OF LESS THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS DOUBLED IN NUMBER DURING NINETEEN SEVENTY TO EIGHTY THREE ACCOUNTING FOR NEARLY ALL THE INCREASE
c2jc0208 CONSEQUENTLY THE BIGGER COMPANIES' SHARE DECREASED MARKEDLY
c2jc0209 IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE OUT OF FOUR HAD SALES EXCEEDING ONE MILLION DOLLARS WHILE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE THIS SHARE HAD FALLEN TO ONE IN SIX
c2jc020a MEANWHILE THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE INCREASED PRESSURE ON THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON THE JAPANESE FOR VIOLATING THE SEMICONDUCTOR ACCORD
c2jc020b THE PANEL APPROVED A RESOLUTION CALLING ON THE PRESIDENT TO RESPOND TO JAPANESE VIOLATIONS OF THE PACT
c2jc020c THE RESOLUTION IS EXPECTED TO BE CONSIDERED ON THE SENATE FLOOR EITHER TODAY OR NEXT WEEK
c2jc020d UNDER THE FEDERAL RAILWAY LABOR ACT THE REJECTION TRIGGERED A THIRTY DAY COOLING OFF PERIOD THAT STARTED YESTERDAY
c2jc020e IF AMERICAN AND ITS UNION CAN'T REACH A SETTLEMENT BY THEN THE AIRLINE CAN IMPOSE ITS LATEST CONTRACT OFFER OR LOCK OUT ITS FLIGHT ATTENDANTS
c2jc020f THE ASSOCIATION OF PROFESSIONAL FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ALSO WOULD BE FREE TO STRIKE BUT IT HAS SAID IT DOESN'T PLAN TO DO SO
c2jc020g BOTH THE I. M. F. AND WORLD BANK MISSIONS ARE LIKELY TO BE CRITICAL OF BRAZIL'S CURRENT POLICIES

c2jc020w SUSPICIOUS MERRILL LYNCH CALLED IRWIN L. JACOBS THE MINNEAPOLIS INVESTOR WHOSE VENTURES INCLUDE MINSTAR
c2jc020x MR. JACOBS TOLD THE BROKERAGE THAT THE ORDER WAS A FAKE AND DISMISSED IT AS A PRANK

c2jc021m THE GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT HAS GROWN AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF ABOUT THREE PERCENT FOR YEARS
c2jc021n SO THE MONETARY AUTHORITY WOULD WANT TO SUPPLY ENOUGH BASE MONEY CURRENCY PLUS BANK RESERVES TO SUPPORT THAT GROWTH
c2jc021o THE TARGET FOR GROWTH OF THE BASE WOULD BE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BASE AND G. N. P. OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS
c2jc021p THERE WOULD ALSO BE A PROVISION TO ADJUST THE BASE WHEN G. N. P. DEPARTS FROM ITS TARGET PATH
c2jc021q MR. MCCALLUM TRIED THE RULE WITH A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC MODELS AND FOUND IT PRODUCED SMOOTHER G. N. P. GROWTH WITH ESSENTIALLY NO INFLATION
c2jc021r THE LEGITIMATE RIGHT OF GOVERNMENT TO PRESCRIBE PENALTIES FOR FRAUD IS WELL UNDERSTOOD IN LAW WHEN A GOOD OR SERVICE IS INVOLVED
c2jc021s LAWS AGAINST FRAUD SHOULD BE NO LESS APPLICABLE TO PLANT CLOSINGS OR MASS LAYOFFS

c2jc021v IF MADE PRACTICAL THEY COULD BRING SPECTACULAR CHANGES TO ALMOST ANY ELECTRICAL PRODUCT OR PROCESS
c2jc021w THAT COULD MEAN VASTLY FASTER AND MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS SUCH AS COMPUTERS CARS AND HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES
c2jc021x BUT UNTIL THE RECENT BREAKTHROUGH SUPERCONDUCTORS HAD TO BE CHILLED TO A HOPELESSLY LOW TEMPERATURE TO WORK SO EXCEPT FOR A FEW APPLICATIONS THERE REALLY WAS NO TECHNOLOGY

c2jc0221 THE SALE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS NOT WIDELY EXPECTED
c2jc0222 BUT DESPITE THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE THE NEWS HAD LITTLE NET EFFECT ON THE SECONDARY MARKET FOR NEW YORK BONDS
c2jc0223 THERE ISN'T ENOUGH SUPPLY FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE SIZABLE OFFERING TO HAVE MUCH IMPACT EXPLAINED ONE TRADER
c2jc0224 MR. JACOBS DESCRIBED THE CURRENT EIGHT PERCENT INFLATION RATE AS HIGHER THAN DESIRABLE
c2jc0225 HE ALSO SAID IT MIGHT ACCELERATE FURTHER OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS BEFORE LEVELING OFF
c2jc0226 BUT THE FINANCIAL SECRETARY SAID HE HOPED THAT PRICE INCREASES LIKE THE LABOR SHORTAGE WOULD EASE IF THE LOCAL ECONOMY SLOWS AS HE HAS PREDICTED

c2kc020w FROM SUGAR LONG PROTECTED TO WHEAT TO FLOWERS FARMERS ARE DEMANDING THAT BORDERS BE CLOSED
c2kc020x THE LOSERS PARTICULARLY IN SUGAR ARE MANY OF THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES WHOSE DESPERATE ECONOMIES THE U. S. GOVERNMENT IS OTHERWISE TRYING TO SALVAGE
c2kc020y BUT EVEN INVESTORS WHO DO ALL THE HOMEWORK AND REQUEST ALL THE DOCUMENTS SHOULDN'T FEEL TOO COMPLACENT
c2kc020z THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MUST BE UPDATED EVERY YEAR SO NEW PROSPECTUSES ARE ISSUED ANNUALLY
c2kc0210 SOMETIMES ONLY THE PER SHARE DATA TABLE CHANGES BUT OFTEN OTHER REVISIONS ARE INCLUDED
c2kc0211 DAVID FLEISCHER AN ANALYST AT PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES THINKS TENNECO BY NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETEEN NINETY ONE COULD EARN EIGHT DOLLARS A SHARE FROM EXISTING OPERATIONS
c2kc0212 THAT WOULD BE A SIXFOLD INCREASE FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PROFIT WHICH HE PUTS AT ONLY ONE DOLLAR AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS A SHARE
c2kc0213 TENNECO STANDS TO BENEFIT GREATLY FROM A PICK UP AT ITS OIL AND GAS AND FARM EQUIPMENT BUSINESSES HE SAYS
c2kc0214 JUDGE BORK'S LIKELY DEFEAT IS A TURNING POINT IN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY PRECISELY BECAUSE IT IS NOT A TURNING POINT
c2kc0215 NEVER BEFORE HAS A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BEEN DEFEATED BECAUSE OF HIS GENERAL APPROACH TO THE CONSTITUTION
c2kc0216 THIS DEFEAT CONSOLIDATES THE APPROACH TO THE CONSTITUTION THAT HAS BEEN FOLLOWED FOR THE PAST FIFTY YEARS
c2kc0217 NEARLY ALL THE GAINERS WERE COMPANIES THAT SELL TO CUSTOMERS OTHER THAN PERSONAL COMPUTER MAKERS
c2kc0218 <NOISE> INTEL THE BIGGEST O. T. C. SEMICONDUCTOR MAKER AND BY FAR THE LARGEST ELECTRONICS ISSUE ON NASDAQ FELL ONE QUARTER TO TWENTY THREE AND THREE QUARTERS
c2kc0219 L. S. I. LOGIC ANOTHER BIG SEMICONDUCTOR CONCERN WITH SOME P. C. MAKING CUSTOMERS WAS UNCHANGED AT SEVEN AND THREE QUARTERS
c2kc021b I FIND LITTLE EVIDENCE OF THE WIDESPREAD PESSIMISM YOU SAY ABOUNDS ON THE NATION'S FARMS
c2kc021c IN FACT THE FARM CRISIS NOW EASING HAS TAUGHT OUR FOOD AND FIBER GROWERS TO BE TOUGHER BUSINESSMEN MORE COST CONSCIOUS AND BETTER PLANNERS
c2kc021d MANY ALREADY ANTICIPATE A DECREASE IN FEDERAL FARM SUBSIDIES AND ARE FINE TUNING THEIR OPERATIONS TO BE PROFITABLE WITHOUT THEM
c2kc021e THEY SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR THESE EFFORTS
c2kc021f FEDERAL POLICY MAKERS WRESTLING WITH BUDGET DEFICITS HAVE MUCH TO LEARN FROM THEM
c2kc021g <NOISE> IN A RECENT PAPER PRESENTED TO FELLOW LOBBYISTS MISS FARTHING EXPLAINED HOW TO GET LEVERAGE FROM SUCH A PROGRAM
c2kc021h SHE RECOMMENDED SENDING INVITATIONS FIRST TO MEMBERS OF TAX WRITING COMMITTEES AND TO SENIOR OPINION MOLDERS WHO LOBBY THEIR COLLEAGUES
c2kc021i SHE ALSO SUGGESTED SENDING A CAR TO FETCH THE LAWMAKER WHOSE GOODWILL YOU WISH TO STIMULATE AND MAKING SURE THAT THE CHECK IS ISSUED PROMPTLY
c2kc021j FOR A SHIP OR MISSILE GUIDED BY THE WRONG TIME SIGNAL THAT LITTLE GAP COULD MEAN ARRIVING AT THE WRONG DESTINATION
c2kc021k IF WE LET THE DIFFERENCE GROW SAYS MR. MCCARTHY WE COULD RUN INTO PROBLEMS OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS
c2kc021l IT MIGHT BE NOON BY ATOMIC TIME BUT DARK OUTSIDE
c2kc021m AT ONE POINT LAST SUMMER MR. WALSH EVEN CONSIDERED SEEKING MAJOR INDICTMENTS BEFORE SOME PRINCIPAL WITNESSES IN CONGRESS'S IRAN CONTRA HEARINGS WERE HEARD
c2kc021n BLEARY EYED PROSECUTORS STAYED UP UNTIL DAWN SEVERAL DAYS IN A ROW DRAFTING A FLURRY OF PROPOSED CHARGES MOTIONS AND OTHER COURT FILINGS REQUESTED BY MR. WALSH
c2kc021o THE IDEA WAS TO SEEK INDICTMENTS QUICKLY BEFORE MESSRS.
c2kc021p POINDEXTER AND NORTH AND OTHERS TESTIFIED UNDER CONGRESSIONAL GRANTS OF LIMITED IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION
c2kc021q DOW PRESIDENT FRANK POPOFF SAID IN A STATEMENT THAT BOTH PRICE AND VOLUME INCREASES BOLSTERED EARNINGS
c2kc021r THE COMPANY'S STRONG COST CONTAINMENT EFFORTS ALSO HELPED
c2kc021s COSTS REMAIN STABLE VOLUME HAS INCREASED AND THERE IS NO WEAKNESS APPARENT IN EITHER THE PRODUCT LINES OR GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS MR. POPOFF SAID
c2kc021u HE CARRIED SIX IN TEN WHITE PROTESTANTS SEVEN IN TEN CATHOLICS AND ABOUT AN EQUAL PROPORTION OF THE STATE'S JEWISH VOTERS
c2kc021v SENATOR GORE WHO MADE A STRONG PITCH FOR JEWISH SUPPORT DURING THE CAMPAIGN BY STRESSING HIS SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL WON FEWER THAN ONE IN FIVE JEWISH VOTES
c2kc021x UNDER THE ARRANGEMENTS UNVEILED THIS WEEK HE IS TO SUCCEED MR. ESCAMEZ AS CHAIRMAN OF THE NEW BANCO CENTRAL BANESTO COMBINATION IN THREE YEARS
c2kc021y MR. ESCAMEZ FOR HIS PART WILL BECOME CHAIRMAN OF THE BANK'S ADVISORY COMMITTEE A NON EXECUTIVE ROLE
c2kc021z STILL MS. FREEDMAN NOTICED THAT A BRIGHT FORECAST FOR HIRING ISN'T NECESSARILY ALL GOOD NEWS
c2kc0220 THE INCREASING USE OF LABOR MAY BE BECAUSE OF A TREMENDOUS BOOM IN THE OUTPUT OF GOODS AND SERVICES SHE SAID
c2kc0221 BUT IT ALSO MIGHT BE BECAUSE YOU AREN'T IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY WITH WHICH YOU USE THE LABOR FORCE THE PRODUCTIVITY
c2kc0222 BLAME IT ON A LOCAL NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN ORDINANCE THAT BARS WORLDLY EMPLOYMENT OR BUSINESS EXCEPT WORKS OF NECESSITY AND CHARITY ON SUNDAY
c2kc0224 THE PURPOSE OF THE BAN IS TO KEEP DOWN TRAFFIC THE TOWN SAYS
c2kc0225 INDEED NO CHANGES ARE LIKELY SOON BECAUSE THE WHOLESALERS AND SMALL RETAILERS THAT BENEFIT FROM THE EXISTING SYSTEM ARE WELL ORGANIZED BACKERS OF THE RULING LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY
c2kc0226 THE JAPANESE DEBATE ON THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM BEGAN ONLY RECENTLY
c2kc0227 EVEN AFTER A CONSENSUS IS REACHED NEW LEGISLATION MAY HAVE TO BE DRAFTED AND ENACTED
c2kc0228 FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS THE KURDS HAVE STRUGGLED TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT KURDISTAN IN A TERRITORY THAT STRADDLES PARTS OF TURKEY IRAQ AND IRAN
c2kc0229 LIKE THE PALESTINIANS THE WORLD'S TWENTY MILLION KURDS SHARE A RELIGION A CULTURE A LANGUAGE AND A PASSION FOR AUTONOMY
c2kc022a NEARLY HALF LIVE IN TURKEY WHICH REFUSES EVEN TO RECOGNIZE THEM AS A DISTINCT NATIONAL MINORITY AND REFERS TO THEM ONLY AS MOUNTAIN TURKS
c2kc022b THOUGH THE KURDS OUTNUMBER THE PALESTINIANS BY A RATIO OF FIVE TO ONE THE KURDISH CAUSE HAS ATTRACTED LITTLE GLOBAL ATTENTION
c2kc022c THE PLAN WAS CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED TO CONFORM WITH THE CONSERVATIVE GRADUALIST PRINCIPLES OF THE EXISTING BAKER PLAN DEVISED BY FORMER SECRETARY BAKER
c2kc022d THAT APPROACH FEATURES A MENU OF OPTIONS BY WHICH BANKS AND DEBTOR COUNTRIES MIGHT VOLUNTARILY NEGOTIATE NEW LOANS OR REDUCTIONS IN DEBT
c2kc022e THE PLAN OPPOSES GOVERNMENT ASSUMPTION OF BANK RISK OR BAILOUTS AND STRESSES NEW LENDING OVER DEBT RELIEF
c2kc022f MR. JORDAN WAS AWARDED DAMAGES OF NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS AND A PUNITIVE AWARD OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
c2kc022h THE APPEALS COURT UPHELD THE LOWER COURT IN OCTOBER NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
c2kc022i ONE OF THE AFFINITY CARDS THAT CHEMICAL BANK DROPPED WAS MARKETED TO ALUMNI OF NEW YORK UNIVERSITY
c2kc022j WE WERE SATISFIED WITH THE PROGRAM WHILE IT WAS RUNNING SAYS ROBERT CUNNINGHAM DIRECTOR OF ALUMNI RELATIONS AT N. Y. U.
c2lc0201 OCTOBER'S CONTRACTING FOR TRANSPORTATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRUCTION SURGED THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT TO AN ANNUAL RATE OF FORTY FOUR POINT THREE NINE BILLION DOLLARS FOLLOWING A SHARP DECLINE IN SEPTEMBER
c2lc0202 THE RALLY IN PUBLIC WORKS CONSTRUCTION DOMINATED THE MONTH'S ACTIVITY
c2lc0203 MODEST GAINS IN HOME BUILDING WERE OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION
c2lc0204 ME AND THE GUY I WAS WITH WERE FISHING ALONG SOME WEEDS NOT GETTING MUCH OF ANYTHING COOK RECALLS
c2lc0205 I HOOKED A BIG ONE AND IT GOT AWAY
c2lc0206 I THOUGHT UH OH THAT'S IT FOR ME TODAY
c2lc0207 COUPLE MINUTES LATER THE EIGHT POUNDER HIT
c2lc0208 JUST LUCKY I GUESS
c2lc0209 THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED HOWEVER
c2lc020a A PROVISION IN THE SPENDING BILL REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST ONE THIRD OF THE REPAIR AND OVERHAUL WORK ON SHIPS BE DONE LOCALLY AT THEIR HOME PORTS
c2lc020b THAT MAKES IT A BIG DEAL FOR TODD AND LOCKHEED MR. DICKS SAYS REFERRING TO TWO PUGET SOUND SHIPYARDS
c2lc020c STILL EVEN A MAJOR SLOWDOWN COULD PERMIT HEFTY FUND GROWTH CONSIDERING LAST YEAR'S RECORD GROSS SALES TO INVESTORS OF TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS
c2lc020d NET NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX SALES AFTER REDEMPTIONS WERE ONE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS
c2lc020e A SPOT SURVEY HERE SHOWED THAT MANY EXECUTIVES THINK BOTH GROSS AND NET SALES FOR THE INDUSTRY THIS YEAR MAY RANGE FROM FLAT TO DOWN THIRTY PERCENT FROM LAST YEAR
c2lc020f THE SALE COMPLETES ALLIED'S PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED DIVESTITURE OF ITS ELECTRONICS AND INSTRUMENTATION BUSINESSES
c2lc020g THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM INVOLVED THE SALE OF SEVEN COMPANIES INCLUDING NEPTUNE
c2lc020h PROCEEDS WILL BE USED TO REDUCE DEBT CONTINUE THE COMPANY'S SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM AND FOR INVESTMENTS
c2lc020i BUT FIRST CITY WOUND UP MAKING LOANS TO SOME OF THE MOST TROUBLED ENERGY CONCERNS IN TEXAS
c2lc020j IT CONCENTRATED MORE THAN A THIRD OF ITS ENERGY LENDING IN THE ROLLERCOASTER FORTUNES OF SERVICE AND DRILLING COMPANIES
c2lc020k WHEN THE ENERGY INDUSTRY WAS GROWING THE LOANS WERE HIGHLY PROFITABLE OFTEN YIELDING TWO OR THREE POINTS OVER THE PRIME RATE
c2lc020l BUT WHEN OIL PRICES FELL IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO AND EXPLORATION SLOWED THESE COMPANIES SOME OF THEM YOUNG AND HIGHLY LEVERAGED QUICKLY RAN INTO PROBLEMS
c2lc020m IN THE END THERE IS LITTLE THE U. S. CAN DO TO CONTROL EVENTS IN SOUTH AFRICA
c2lc020n THE ADMINISTRATION'S SIX YEAR CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT POLICY DESIGNED TO COAX PRETORIA TOWARDS DISMANTLING APARTHEID DIDN'T SUCCEED
c2lc020o AND SANCTIONS IN THE SHORT RUN WON'T DAMAGE SOUTH AFRICA'S SELF RELIANT ECONOMY
c2lc020p BUT THE PERCEPTION OF INACTION HAS DIPLOMATIC COSTS FOR THE U. S. AND SO FOR THE TIME BEING SANCTIONS SEEM TO BE THE BEST BET
c2lc020q BUT EVEN INVESTORS WHO DO ALL THE HOMEWORK AND REQUEST ALL THE DOCUMENTS SHOULDN'T FEEL TOO COMPLACENT
c2lc020r THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MUST BE UPDATED EVERY YEAR SO NEW PROSPECTUSES ARE ISSUED ANNUALLY
c2lc020s SOMETIMES ONLY THE PER SHARE DATA TABLE CHANGES BUT OFTEN OTHER REVISIONS ARE INCLUDED
c2lc020t JUDGE BORK HOWEVER ASKED FOR NONE OF THIS
c2lc020u BORK DOESN'T WANT A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN MR. GARMENT CONCEDES
c2lc020v I TOLD HIM I WOULD DO THIS UNLESS HE VIOLENTLY OBJECTED
c2lc020w HE SAID YOU'RE A FREE AGENT GARMENT
c2lc020x DO WHAT YOU THINK IS APPROPRIATE
c2lc020y FACED WITH MOUNTING COMPLAINTS THE STATE DEPARTMENT REMOVED FIDELITY FROM ITS LIST OF RECOMMENDED WAREHOUSES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND THE COMPANY DECIDED TO SHUT ITS DOORS
c2lc020z UNDER GOVERNMENT SUPERVISION FIDELITY MOVED THE DIPLOMATS' GOODS TO OTHER WAREHOUSING COMPANIES
c2lc0210 IT HAS OFTEN PROVED IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER GOODS WERE DAMAGED OR LOST BY FIDELITY OR RATHER BY THE WAREHOUSES THEY WERE MOVED TO AFTER FIDELITY FOLDED
c2lc0211 SURELY THE PRODUCER PRICE INDEX HAS BEEN GIVING THE FED NO CAUSE TO WORRY ABOUT INFLATION
c2lc0212 WHEN THE DECEMBER STATISTIC IS RELEASED THIS WEEK ANALYSTS BELIEVE IT WILL SHOW LITTLE OR NO CHANGE FOR THE THIRD MONTH IN A ROW
c2lc0213 ENERGY PRICES STABILIZED AND REBATES HELD DOWN AUTO PRICES
c2lc0214 OFFICIALS HERE ARE SEEING RED OVER VIDEOTAPE CASSETTES
c2lc0215 THEY'RE SEEING GREEN AND BLUE TOO
c2lc0216 BUT WHAT THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE IS BLACK THE COLOR OF THE STANDARD VIDEOCASSETTE CONTAINER IN MANY COUNTRIES
c2lc0217 THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIRTY SHARE INDEX CLOSED SEVEN POINT ONE POINTS LOWER AT ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTEEN POINT FOUR THE DAY'S BEST LEVEL
c2lc0218 VOLUME TOTALED A MODEST FOUR HUNDRED FORTY TWO POINT NINE MILLION SHARES DOWN FROM FIVE HUNDRED NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION FRIDAY
c2lc0219 THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX CLOSED THIRTEEN POINT TWO POINTS LOWER AT ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY POINT TWO
c2lc021a A BETTER TEST OF THE FED'S INTENTIONS PROBABLY WON'T COME UNTIL MID MARCH MR. MAUDE SAID
c2lc021b AT THAT TIME TECHNICAL FACTORS NOTABLY CORPORATE TAX PAYMENTS WILL PLACE RENEWED UPWARD PRESSURE ON THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE
c2lc021c IN THE INTERIM HOWEVER THE BEST BET IS TO ASSUME THAT THE FED HAS EASED POLICY
c2lc021d BUT FOR THE LONGER TERM FIGURING OUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT COMPUTERIZED TRADING MAY BE AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK SOME INVESTORS FEAR
c2lc021e I'D LOVE FOR ALL THIS STUFF JUST TO GO AWAY
c2lc021f BUT IT'S LIKE NUCLEAR ENERGY SAYS JOHN B. CARROLL THE VICE PRESIDENT OF G. T. E. CORPORATION'S INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT UNIT
c2lc021g IT'S THERE AND IT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY
c2lc021h THE TECHNOLOGY NOW EXISTS FOREVER
c2lc021i IN ADDITION BATUS IS EXPECTED THIS MORNING TO FILE FOR APPROVAL OF A TAKEOVER WITH INSURANCE REGULATORS IN NINE WESTERN STATES WHERE FARMERS OPERATES
c2lc021j APPROVAL BY ALL IS CONSIDERED NECESSARY FOR A SUCCESSFUL TAKEOVER THE COMPANY'S WALL STREET ADVISERS HAVE SAID
c2lc021k IN ITS OFFER BATUS SIGNALED THAT THE APPROVAL PROCESS MAY TAKE MONTHS
c2lc021l BUT USING OUTSIDE HELP CAN INVOLVE LARGE AND SOMETIMES SUBTLE COSTS
c2lc021m MOST TEMPORARY WORKERS AREN'T AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO BE MOTIVATED BY TRADITIONAL INCENTIVES LIKE PAY INCREASES PROMOTIONS OR APPEALS TO CORPORATE LOYALTY
c2lc021n THUS MANAGERS MUST USE MORE IMAGINATIVE MEANS EXPERTS SAY TO ENSURE THAT PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE DON'T SUFFER
c2lc021o MANY DEBT HOLDERS SHRUGGED OFF THE F. D. I. C.'S THREAT TO ALLOW FIRST CITY'S BANKS TO FAIL
c2lc021p AT FIRST F. D. I. C. OFFICIALS SUGGESTED THAT WOULD LEAVE CREDITORS EMPTY HANDED
c2lc021q BUT THAT CAME TO LOOK UNLIKELY AS FIRST CITY HAD SOME HEALTHY BANKS AND REGULATORS CAN CLOSE ONLY INSOLVENT BANKS
c2lc021r IF THEY HAD TAKEN OVER THE SICK BANKS CREDITORS MANY OF THEM ARBITRAGERS WHO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PROFIT COULD HAVE PURSUED CLAIMS AGAINST THE SOLVENT ONES
c2lc021s SHARON ZIEMIAN ASSISTANT VICE PRESIDENT PRECIOUS METALS AT CITICORP'S CITIBANK N. A. NEW YORK OBSERVED THAT YESTERDAY'S MARKET REFLECTED CONFUSION
c2lc021t WHILE INFLATION FEARS ABOUND INFLATION ITSELF IS HARD TO ACTUALLY PIN DOWN SHE SAID
c2lc021u THIS CREATES THE WORRY THAT IF INTEREST RATES ARE RAISED IN ORDER TO COMBAT INFLATION THE FRAGILITY OF THE ECONOMY COULD BRING ABOUT A RECESSION
c2lc021v ONE DAY THOSE WORDS HAUNT THIS LAND OF IMMENSE SUFFERING
c2lc021w ONE DAY SAY THE PEASANT FARMERS THE FOURTEEN YEAR BUSH WAR AGAINST ANTI GOVERNMENT REBELS WILL BE OVER
c2lc021x ONE DAY DROUGHT WILL DISAPPEAR FROM OUR LAND
c2lc021y ONE DAY THE ECONOMY WILL RECOVER
c2lc021z ONE DAY WE WILL BE ABLE TO FEED OURSELVES
c2lc0220 NOR IS THE NUMBER SEVENTEEN A MAGIC NUMBER STRESSED DOCTOR SHAW
c2lc0221 IF WE HAD TWO HUNDRED FIFTY COPIES WE MIGHT HAVE FOUND ONE HUNDRED DIFFERENT VIRUSES HE SAID
c2lc0222 HE TERMED THE SPEED OF MUTATION EXTRAORDINARY AND COMPARED THE AIDS VIRUS WITH OTHER SWIFTLY CHANGING VIRUSES SUCH AS INFLUENZA
c2lc0223 DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT BETTER DESCRIBED AS BROODING ABOUT IT IS FILLED WITH MISCONCEPTIONS
c2lc0224 ONE OF THESE IS THE GREAT CONCERN WITH THE U. S. HAVING BECOME A NET DEBTOR
c2lc0225 WHAT IS MEANT BY THAT IS THAT AMERICANS APPARENTLY OWN FEWER ASSETS ABROAD THAN FOREIGNERS OWN IN THE U. S.
c2lc0226 MANY PEOPLE HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THESE CALCULATIONS ARE SPURIOUS BECAUSE THE ASSETS ARE NOT ALL VALUED ON THE SAME BASIS
c2lc0227 IF ALL ASSETS WERE VALUED AT TODAY'S PRICES THE NET DEBT OF THE U. S. WOULD CERTAINLY BE MUCH SMALLER THAN IT NOW APPEARS AND MIGHT BE A NET ASSET
c2lc0228 TOBACCO HEIRESS DORIS DUKE AGREED TO POST FIVE MILLION DOLLARS NEEDED BY IMELDA MARCOS TO SECURE BAIL ON RACKETEERING CHARGES
c2lc0229 DUKE IS THE DAUGHTER OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN TOBACCO COMPANY MARCOS AND HER HUSBAND THE DEPOSED PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES ARE ACCUSED OF LOOTING MANILA'S TREASURY
c2lc022a HIS ARRANGEMENT HAS BEEN DELAYED
c2lc022b NONE OF THIS MEANS JAPANESE INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT WILL BE TRANSFORMED OVERNIGHT
c2lc022c CHANGE WILL COME SLOWLY BECAUSE JAPANESE SOCIETY STILL HAS A STRONG TENDENCY TO HAMMER DOWN ANY NAIL THAT STICKS UP
c2lc022d THERE MAY BE GROWING JAPANESE SELF CONFIDENCE IN JAPAN BUT THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW JAPANESE ENTREPRENEURS
c2lc022e THERE MAY BE SCADS OF MONEY IN JAPAN BUT THERE IS PRECIOUS LITTLE VENTURE CAPITAL
c2lc022f BEIRUT RESIDENTS JAMMED A COASTAL HIGHWAY LEADING SOUTH FROM THE CAPITAL TO ESCAPE ARTILLERY DUELS BETWEEN CHRISTIAN AND SYRIAN FORCES
c2lc022g POLICE ESTIMATED THAT ONLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OF BEIRUT'S ONE POINT FIVE MILLION INHABITANTS REMAIN
c2lc022h MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN FIGHTING THAT ERUPTED MARCH FOURTH THE LATEST ROUND IN LEBANON'S FOURTEEN YEAR OLD CIVIL WAR
c2lc022i BROKERAGE FIRMS WHICH NEGOTIATE RATES WITH THE BANKS AND THRIFTS WHOSE C. D.'S THEY SELL OFFER SOME OF THE BEST YIELDS
c2lc022j THE AVERAGE YIELD ON A BROKER SOLD THREE MONTH C. D. FOR EXAMPLE WAS EIGHT POINT SIX SIX PERCENT
c2lc022k THE AVERAGE YIELD ON TWO YEAR C. D.S SOLD BY BROKERS ROSE NEARLY A FIFTH OF A PERCENTAGE POINT TO EIGHT POINT FOUR THREE PERCENT
