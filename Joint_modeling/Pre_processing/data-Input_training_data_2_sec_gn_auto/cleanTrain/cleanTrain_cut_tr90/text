c04c021m NAVY WARSHIPS AND AIRCRAFT SEARCHED FOR A MISSING U. S. HELICOPTER IN THE SOUTHERN PERSIAN GULF AS IRAN ATTACKED TWO COMMERCIAL VESSELS
c04c021n THE GUNSHIP CARRYING TWO CREW MEMBERS FAILED TO RETURN TO A CRUISER FOLLOWING MONDAY'S RAIDS ON IRANIAN OIL PLATFORMS AND VESSELS
c04c021o THE PENTAGON ALSO SAID SEVERAL MINES WERE FOUND IN THE AREA
c04c021p SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH OLDER OR LARGER BUSINESSES THINK GEORGE BUSH'S POLICIES WOULD BE THE MOST FAVORABLE FOR SMALL BUSINESS
c04c021q BUT THE VICE PRESIDENT HARDLY WON A RINGING ENDORSEMENT HE RATED ONLY FIVE POINT EIGHT ON A SCALE OF TEN
c04c021r AND AMONG WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS MR. BUSH HAD ONLY A FOUR POINT EIGHT RATING
c04c021s MR. TANAKA WAS AMONG THE FIRST SCIENTISTS TO RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL OF SUPERCONDUCTORS WHICH ARE SUBSTANCES THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRICITY WITH NO RESISTANCE AND THUS NO LOSS OF POWER
c04c021t IF MADE PRACTICAL THEY COULD BRING SPECTACULAR CHANGES TO ALMOST ANY ELECTRICAL PRODUCT OR PROCESS
c04c021u THAT WOULD MEAN VASTLY FASTER AND MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS SUCH AS COMPUTERS CARS AND HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES
c04c021v BUT UNTIL THE RECENT BREAKTHROUGH SUPERCONDUCTORS HAD TO BE CHILLED TO A HOPELESSLY LOW TEMPERATURE TO WORK SO EXCEPT FOR A FEW APPLICATIONS THERE REALLY WAS NO TECHNOLOGY
c04c021w FINALLY THERE'S THE WELFARE PROBLEM
c04c021x NOT ALL WORKERS ARE AS LUCKY AS JOSEPH
c04c021y SOME GET SICK OR INJURED AND LOSE THEIR JOBS
c04c021z OTHERS WHO TURNED THEIR LIFE SAVINGS OVER TO BROKERS IN ORDER TO GET HERE DISCOVER THAT PROMISES OF MONEY MEALS AND LODGING WERE BOGUS
c04c0220 FEAR OF DEPORTATION PREVENTS THEM FROM GOING TO THE POLICE FOR HELP
c04c0221 THERE ARE UNCONFIRMED REPORTS OF WORKERS STARVING TO DEATH HERE
c04c0222 BURNUP AND SIMS HAS INTERESTS IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND SOFT DRINKS AMONG OTHER THINGS
c04c0223 MR. POSNER BEGAN INVESTING IN IT IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND BY THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES CONTROLLED MORE THAN FORTY PERCENT OF ITS SHARES
c04c0224 BUT BURNUP AND SIMS MANAGEMENT WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND AT ONE POINT EIGHTEEN TOP BURNUP AND SIMS QUIT IN PROTEST
c04c0225 BY NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THE COMPANIES WERE EXCHANGING SUITS THAT HAVE LINGERED IN THE COURTS EVER SINCE
c04c0226 THE POTENTIAL REWARD IS SIMPLY NOT WORTH THE RISK AN A. M. GENERAL SPOKESMAN SAID
c04c0227 IF YOU DID A CASH FLOW CHART IT LOOKED AWFUL UNTIL WAY OUT IN THE FUTURE
c04c0228 UNACCEPTABLY AWFUL
c04c0229 THE APPARENT INCONSISTENCY IS JUSTIFIED MAINTAINED ROBERT BURGER CHEVROLET GENERAL MANAGER GIVEN THE GROWING DIFFICULTY IN LAUNCHING MODELS IN AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE FIELD
c04c022a IN ESTABLISHING PRODUCTS WITH CONSUMERS HE SAID IT'S EASIER TO FOCUS AD DOLLARS AND MARKETING EFFORTS IF THERE'S ONLY ONE NAME TO PROMOTE
c04c022b CHEVROLET IS USING THE SAME APPROACH WITH ITS GEO LINE OF IMPORT CARS THAT DEBUTS THIS FALL
c04c022c OFFICIALS OF BOTH SAUDI ARABIA AND TEXACO NOTED THE KINGDOM AND THE COMPANY HAVE HAD AN ASSOCIATION OF MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS IN THE PRODUCTION OF PETROLEUM
c04c022d AND THEIR JOINT VENTURE REPRESENTS BY FAR THE BIGGEST MOVE YET INTO REFINING AND MARKETING BY A MEMBER OF THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES
c04c022e THE JOINT VENTURE WILL RANK TENTH IN TOTAL GASOLINE SALES IN THE U. S.
c04c022f BECAUSE THE AUTO INDUSTRY'S GOOD TIMES ROLLED ON SO LONG EACH COMPANY ASSUMED THAT WHEN THE CRUNCH CAME THE OTHER GUY WOULD GET HURT
c04c022g THAT WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE OF HONDA
c04c022h FOR YEARS WHILE RIVALS DANGLED ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR REBATES AND INTEREST FREE LOANS BEFORE BUYERS HONDA STOOD ABOVE IT ALL
c04c022i IT EFFORTLESSLY SOLD ALL THE CARS IT COULD MAKE IN THE U. S. AND ALL IT COULD SHIP FROM JAPAN
c04c022j S. AND P'S EVENT RISK COVENANT RANKINGS WHICH WERE STARTED LAST MONTH HAVE FIVE CATEGORIES
c04c022k E. THREE STANDS MIDWAY
c04c022l TRADERS HAVE SAID THAT BOWATER BONDS WAS THE BEST RECEIVED DEAL IN THE PAST TWO SESSIONS BECAUSE OF STRONG INVESTOR DEMAND FOR EVENT RISK PROTECTION
c04c022m STILL SOME FIXED INCOME ADVISERS AREN'T CONVINCED THAT THESE FUNDS ARE A GOOD DEAL FOR THE AVERAGE INVESTOR
c04c022n IT'S NOT A GOOD INVESTMENT IN THIS ENVIRONMENT SAYS MARILYN COHEN PRESIDENT OF CAPITAL INSIGHT A BEVERLY HILLS CALIFORNIA BOND TRADING FIRM
c04c022o WITH A POSSIBLE RECESSION AHEAD WHAT IS AN EXCELLENT QUALITY LOAN TODAY MIGHT BE JUNK TOMORROW
c04c022p WITH INCREASED RETURN OVER C. D. RATES ISN'T WORTH IT
c04c022q HITLER AND STALIN WERE FRIENDS SAYS AN OLD MAN TURNING IN A SEAT TO FACE MR. SEMIONENKOV
c04c022r ANOTHER WALKS TO THE BACK OF THE BUS
c04c022s THE POLISH PEOPLE KNEW IT LONG AGO
c04c022t IT WAS THE RUSSIANS
c05c0201 HOWEVER THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION HAS ITS OWN PRIORITIES
c05c0202 IT HAS BEEN PRESSURING GERMANY TO CUT ITS INTEREST RATES TO STIMULATE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND BY IMPLICATION CREATE A BIGGER MARKET FOR U. S. EXPORTS
c05c0203 THIS EXPLAINS THE WAR OF WORDS OVER GERMANY'S REFUSAL TO CUT INTEREST RATES FOR MUCH OF LAST YEAR
c05c0204 THE DISPUTE CAN BE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AFTER THE PRESENT CENTER RIGHT COALITION GOVERNMENT OF CHANCELLOR HELMUT KOHL RECORDS ITS EXPECTED ELECTION VICTORY NEXT WEEK
c05c0205 EVEN WHEN COMPLAINTS ARE FILED THEY CAN BE DIFFICULT TO VERIFY
c05c0206 AGENCIES GENERALLY DON'T USE UNDERCOVER TESTERS POSING AS PROSPECTIVE TENANTS AS THEY DO IN RACE DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS THEY FEAR THAT THE TESTER COULD BE ATTACKED
c05c0207 INSTEAD THEY TRY TO BUILD CASES ON THE TESTIMONY OF CURRENT AND FORMER TENANTS
c05c0208 THE FINANCIAL ENTREPRENEUR IS A SOPHISTICATED PARTICIPANT IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS USING ITS RESOURCES TO HIS ADVANTAGE
c05c0209 IF HE IS A RAIDER MOST OFTEN HE IS INTERESTED IN THE ARBITRAGE BETWEEN THE ACQUISITION VALUE OF THE ENTERPRISE AND THE ULTIMATE VALUE OF ITS PARTS
c05c020a THE LEVERAGED BUYOUT ARTIST ON THE OTHER HAND IS MOST OFTEN A PARTNER WITH MANAGEMENT IN ACQUIRING AND OPERATING THE ENTERPRISE
c05c020b HE MAY FINANCE THE ACQUISITION WITH JUNK BONDS OR HE MAY DO IT PRIVATELY WITH LEADING INSURANCE COMPANIES AND COMMERCIAL BANKS
c05c020c WITHIN A YEAR OR TWO OF ACQUIRING CONTROL HE MAY SEEK TO RAISE NEW MONEY IN THE PUBLIC EQUITY OR DEBT MARKETS
c05c020d RAYTHEON DENIED THAT IT'S FREELY GIVING AWAY JOBS
c05c020e WE AREN'T CRAZY ABOUT OFFSETS BUT WE'D ENTER INTO THEM AS A COMPROMISE BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT IF IT'S THE BEST THAT'S AVAILABLE SAID RAYTHEON SPOKESMAN LAWRENCE MCCRACKEN
c05c020f <NOISE> HE ADDED THAT THERE WERE ALSO SOME POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS BEHIND THE DECISION TO SHARE THE PATRIOT BUSINESS WITH THE THREE U. S. ALLIES
c05c020g IN AN INTERVIEW HOWEVER MR. TAFT SAID HE SIMPLY WANTS TO RETURN THE COMPANY TO FAMILY CONTROL
c05c020h HIS FATHER FOUNDED THE CONCERN IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE
c05c020i THERE HAVE BEEN RUMORS FOR SOME TIME THAT MR. TAFT WAS UNHAPPY WITH THE CHANGES TAKING PLACE AT THE COMPANY AND WAS PREPARING TO RESIGN
c05c020j THE RULING IS A SIGNIFICANT VICTORY FOR THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION AFTER A MAJOR SETBACK ON THE USE OF GRAND JURY MATERIALS IN A NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE SUPREME COURT RULING
c05c020k IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE THE HIGH COURT RULED THAT LAWYERS HANDLING CIVIL CASES IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT NEEDED A COURT ORDER TO GAIN ACCESS TO SECRET GRAND JURY EVIDENCE
c05c020l JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS COMPLAINED THAT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE RULING HAMPERED THEIR INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS
c05c020m THESE CRITICISMS ARE OVERWROUGHT AND UNCONVINCING
c05c020n WHILE PRIVATE OPERATORS WILL CERTAINLY LOBBY IN THEIR OWN INTEREST IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT THEY COULD MANIPULATE PUBLIC OPINION AND LAWMAKERS AS EASILY AS THEIR OPPONENTS SUGGEST
c05c020o NOR IS IT CLEAR THAT PRIVATE PRISON OPERATORS WOULD HAVE TO LOBBY FOR HARSHER SENTENCES
c05c020p GIVEN CURRENT LEVELS OF OVERCROWDING AND PUBLIC SENTIMENT IN FAVOR OF STRICTER SENTENCING THERE WILL BE NO SHORTAGE OF INMATES TO FILL THE NEW FACILITIES
c05c020q THE DECISION HAS CONSIDERABLE IMMEDIATE PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE
c05c020r MORE THAN A DOZEN OTHER APPEALS RAISING THE ARBITRATION ISSUE HAVE BEEN FILED WITH THE SUPREME COURT
c05c020s AND THE QUESTION OF WHETHER ARBITRATION IS REQUIRED IN SECURITIES FRAUD CASES IS PENDING IN HUNDREDS OF LAWSUITS IN FEDERAL COURTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
c05c020t THE CALL IS LIKELY TO PROMPT HOLDERS TO CONVERT THE SHARES INTO COMMON RATHER THAN HAVE THEM REDEEMED
c05c020u EACH DEPOSITARY SHARE CAN BE CONVERTED INTO ONE AND TWO THIRDS COMMON
c05c020v AS LONG AS THE COMMON IS ABOVE SIXTEEN DOLLARS AND FIFTY NINE CENTS A SHARE THE COMPANY NOTED THE CONVERSION VALUE EXCEEDS THE REDEMPTION PRICE
c05c020w THE OFFER EXPIRES AT FIVE P. M. E. D. T. JULY FIRST
c05c020x INDEED HE SEES A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN THE WORLD'S USE OF RESOURCES
c05c020y WE ARE BEING FAR MORE SKILLFUL IN THE USE OF MATERIAL
c05c020z CONSUMPTION IS ON THE INCREASE BUT AT A MUCH LOWER RATE
c05c0210 THE STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF OHIO HAS INVESTED IN REAL ESTATE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND RECENTLY EXPANDED INTO TIMBERLAND
c05c0211 MOST OF OUR REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO IS IN OFFICE AND RETAIL BUILDINGS SAYS STEPHEN A. MITCHELL DIRECTOR OF INVESTMENTS
c05c0212 BUT WITH THOSE YOU'VE GOT THE RISK OF LOCATION TENANTS AND THE ECONOMY
c05c0213 MEANWHILE PRICES HAVE DROPPED DRAMATICALLY IN TIMBERLAND
c05c0214 IN BOTH THE HUNGARIAN AND SUEZ CRISES THE UNITED STATES PROCEEDED IN ACCORD WITH THE RULE OF AVOIDING DIRECT CONFRONTATION WITH THE SOVIET UNION
c05c0215 IN THE HUNGARIAN AFFAIR THIS MEANT DOING NOTHING EXCEPT TALKING BECAUSE TAKING ANY PRACTICAL STEP WOULD AT ONCE HAVE MEANT A CONFRONTATION
c05c0216 IN THE SUEZ AFFAIR THE AVOIDANCE OF CONFRONTATION WENT ALL THE WAY TO COLLABORATION
c05c0217 ALSO PROVIDING SOME SOLACE FOR MUNICIPAL BOND PROFESSIONALS IS THE FACT THAT COMMERCIAL BANKS ARE BECOMING MORE ACTIVE AS UNDERWRITERS RATHER THAN AS INVESTORS
c05c0218 THIS MEANS THEY WILL NEED TO HIRE MORE INVESTMENT BANKERS
c05c0219 THE BANKS' MOVE IS PART OF THEIR EFFORT TO TEST AND EXPAND THE LIMITS OF SECURITIES AND BANKING LAWS
c05c021a A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ISSUE OF HOUSEHOLD FINANCE CORPORATION SEVEN YEAR NOTES WAS OFFERED THROUGH UNDERWRITERS LED BY MERRILL LYNCH CAPITAL MARKETS
c05c021b THE TEN PERCENT NOTES WERE PRICED AT PAR AND THE RETURN IS ZERO POINT SEVEN TWO OF A PERCENTAGE POINT ABOVE THE RATE ON COMPARABLE TREASURY NOTES
c05c021c THE NOTES ARE RATED DOUBLE A THREE BY MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE INCORPORATED AND DOUBLE A MINUS BY STANDARD AND POOR'S CORPORATION
c05c021d BY SEPTEMBER THE WEAKNESS OF COORDINATED INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO PREVENT DOLLAR DECLINES FINALLY SURFACED
c05c021e IN RESPONSE TO INCREASING INFLATION FEARS GERMANY AND JAPAN BEGAN TIGHTENING MONETARY POLICY AND RAISING INTEREST RATES
c05c021f IN UNTIMELY FASHION SECRETARY BAKER REAFFIRMED THE ADMINISTRATION'S INTENT TO PREVENT DOLLAR DECLINES
c05c021g IN ANTICIPATION OF THE SUBSTANTIAL FED TIGHTENING THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO PREVENT DOLLAR DECLINES U. S. INTEREST RATES SKYROCKETED
c05c021h THE SEEDS OF MARKET DISCONTENT WERE SOWN
c05c021i AFTER LOSING BUSINESS TO CHEAPER MEXICAN IMPORTS IN RECENT YEARS MR. MOORE ADMITS WE JUST CANNOT COMPETE WITH THEM
c05c021j HE ADDS I REALIZE A TRADE WAR CAN MEAN HIGHER PRICES OR A SHORTAGE OF PRODUCTS BUT NOW IS THE TIME TO PROTECT OUR DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES
c05c021k ALL WE NEED IS A LITTLE BIT OF RELIEF TO GET BACK ON TRACK
c05c021l HOURLY COMPENSATION AT NONFINANCIAL FIRMS ROSE AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF THREE PERCENT IN NOMINAL TERMS BUT FELL ZERO POINT EIGHT PERCENT WHEN ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION
c05c021m SECOND QUARTER HOURLY COMPENSATION ROSE AT AN ANNUAL NOMINAL RATE OF TWO POINT SIX PERCENT BUT FELL TWO POINT TWO PERCENT ON AN INFLATION ADJUSTED BASIS
c05c021n UNIT LABOR COSTS INCREASED AT A ZERO POINT FOUR PERCENT YEARLY RATE IN THE THIRD QUARTER AFTER A TWO PERCENT RATE OF GAIN IN THE SECOND QUARTER
c05c021o IN AFGHANISTAN HE ADDS PEOPLE HAVE STAYED IN THE ARMY BECAUSE THEY NEED TO FEED THEIR CHILDREN AND BECAUSE THEY WORRY ABOUT THEIR FAMILIES
c05c021p THEY JOIN OFFENSIVES BECAUSE THE SOVIETS ARE AT THEIR BACKS WITH GUNS
c05c021q NOW THAT THEY KNOW THEY HAVEN'T ANYONE EITHER TO PROTECT THEM OR THREATEN THEM IT WILL HAVE AN EFFECT ON MORALE
c05c021r TAGAMET FOR INSTANCE IS ONE OF THE MOST WIDELY PRESCRIBED AND EFFECTIVE DRUGS FOR TREATING ULCERS
c05c021s HOWEVER IT HAS BEEN KNOWN TO TRIGGER SUCH ADVERSE REACTIONS AS MILD AND TEMPORARY DIARRHEA DIZZINESS DROWSINESS AND RASH
c05c021t TAGAMET ALSO CAN CAUSE MENTAL CONFUSION AGITATION PSYCHOSIS DEPRESSION ANXIETY HALLUCINATIONS AND DISORIENTATION
c05c021u DOCTORS SAY THAT SOME PATIENTS IF INFORMED OF THOSE POTENTIAL OUTCOMES MIGHT CHOOSE NOT TO TAKE THE MEDICINE
c05c021v YOU'VE HAD A TREMENDOUS FALLOFF HERE THAT'S ONLY GOING TO GET BIGGER AS WE APPROACH THE SUMMER DOLDRUMS ONE TRADER SAYS
c05c021w HE ESTIMATES THAT INSTITUTIONAL VOLUME HAS TUMBLED FROM YEAR EARLIER LEVELS BY FORTY PERCENT SO FAR THIS MONTH AND THIRTY PERCENT FOR THE YEAR TO DATE
c05c021x LET'S FACE IT HE SAYS WE NEED COMMISSIONS TO PAY THE BILLS
c05c021y THIS YEAR THROUGH MAY TWENTY THIRD THE FUND WAS ABOUT A HALF PERCENTAGE POINT AHEAD OF THE S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED'S TWO POINT FOUR PERCENT RISE
c05c021z GOING INTO NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT IT EMPHASIZED CYCLICAL STOCKS SUCH AS CHEMICALS AND GAVE LESS WEIGHT THAN MOST FUNDS TO FINANCIAL AND UTILITY STOCKS
c05c0220 IT ALSO HAD NEARLY TWENTY PERCENT OF ASSETS IN CONVERTIBLE BONDS A DEFENSIVE TACTIC
c05c0221 FOR HIS PART MR. BUSH DEFENDS HIS PROPOSALS AS NEEDED AND STRESSES THAT THEY WOULD BE PAID FOR THROUGH CUTS IN SPENDING
c05c0222 THE PROPOSALS DON'T AMOUNT TO AN ASSAULT ON THE CURRENT TAX STRUCTURE CONTENDS BUSH SPOKESMAN STEPHEN HART
c05c0223 THEY ARE LASER LIKE OPENINGS IN THE TAX STRUCTURE FOR SPECIFIC REASONS HE SAYS
c05c0224 ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN FACTORED INTO HIS FLEXIBLE FREEZE OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING
c05c0225 HE ISN'T GOING TO RAISE TAXES PERIOD <NOISE>
c05c0226 THE EXTENT OF THE CONTAMINATION WON'T BE CLEAR FOR SEVERAL WEEKS
c05c0227 IN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AS MUCH AS TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE MIDWEST CORN CROP COULD BE THREATENED
c05c0228 MOST OF THAT CROP IS STILL IN THE FIELD
c05c0229 MINNESOTA AND ILLINOIS OFFICIALS ARE JUST BEGINNING TO SCREEN THE HARVEST
c05c022a ELEVATORS IN THOSE STATES REPORTEDLY HAVE REJECTED CORN THEY DEEM SUSPICIOUS
c05c022b WORRIED THAT CONTAMINATED CORN MAY HAVE BEEN FED TO DAIRY COWS SOME WISCONSIN DAIRIES ARE TESTING MILK FOR AFLATOXIN
c05c022c TO COPE IN THE EARLY GOING THE TALL LEAN MR. HAUPTFUHRER CAN DRAW ON SOLID EXPERIENCE EMPLOYEE LOYALTY AND CONSIDERABLE INVESTOR SUPPORT

c05c022i MANY NEARBY CHINESE FACTORIES SIMPLY SHUT DOWN TWO OR THREE DAYS A WEEK FOR WANT OF ENERGY
c05c022j MOREOVER TWO THOUSAND WORKERS AT THE TIANJIN ALUMINUM PRODUCTS FACTORY RECENTLY WERE ORDERED HOME BECAUSE THE COMPANY COULDN'T GET ENOUGH RAW MATERIALS
c05c022k AT ONE POINT THIS YEAR SUPPLY SHORTAGES FORCED A THIRD OF THE NATION'S ALUMINUM FACTORIES TO CLOSE

c05c022m INDUSTRIELLE OUT OF ITS CASH HOARD OR THROUGH SHORT TERM LOANS
c05c022n ONE SOURCE SAID SUEZ IF VICTORIOUS WOULD LIKELY RESELL PART OF ITS STAKE IN COMPANY
c05c022o INDUSTRIELLE TO RECOUP PART OF ITS COSTS
c05c022p IT COULD ALSO SELL OFF COMPANY

c05c022r IN APRIL DREXEL AGREED TO PAY SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND PLEAD GUILTY TO SIX FELONY COUNTS RELATED TO A FEDERAL INSIDER TRADING INVESTIGATION
c05c022s THE PLEA AGREEMENT WAS MADE IN CONJUNCTION WITH A BROAD SETTLEMENT OF SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
c05c022t BECAUSE THE FIRM AGREED THAT IT COMMITTED FELONIES SECURITIES COMMISSIONERS IN MOST STATES CAN AUTOMATICALLY REVOKE DREXEL'S LICENSE TO DO BUSINESS
c06c0201 THE STATUTE ALLOWS FOR A GREAT DEAL OF LATITUDE AGREES ARTHUR CHRISTY THE FIRST SPECIAL PROSECUTOR APPOINTED UNDER THE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT LAW
c06c0202 IN PAST INVESTIGATIONS HE NOTES THE FOCUS HAS BEEN QUITE NARROW
c06c0203 BUT IN EACH CASE HE SUGGESTS IT'S UP TO THE COUNSEL HE CERTAINLY HAS THE POWERS
c06c0204 BUT WHILE EUREKA PROJECTS ARE MORE EASILY APPROVED THE VAGUENESS OF THEIR FUNDING IS ONE REASON MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE PROGRAM'S VALUE
c06c0205 ANOTHER IS ITS LOOSE ORGANIZATION WITH NO CENTRAL SYSTEM YET ESTABLISHED FOR CHECKING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS
c06c0206 MOST OF THE PROJECTS ADOPTED OVER THE PAST YEAR HAVEN'T GOTTEN OFF THE DRAWING BOARD
c06c0207 BRITAIN IS LAUNCHING A NATIONWIDE AIDS WARNING CAMPAIGN THAT URGES THE USE OF CONDOMS FOR PEOPLE WHO WON'T RESTRICT THEIR SEXUAL PARTNERS

c06c0220 IF IT COMES IN ZERO POINT FIVE PERCENT OR HIGHER THAT'S GOING TO BE BAD FOR BONDS MR. BOZIAN WARNED

c06c022m ECONOMIC COOPERATION WAS ADVANCED WITH BUSINESSMEN SIGNING AGREEMENTS FOR ABOUT THIRTY CONTRACTS AND SEVERAL JOINT VENTURES
c06c022n HUMAN RIGHTS TOO MAY HAVE TAKEN A STEP FORWARD IF MR. GORBACHEV LIVES UP TO HIS PROMISE TO RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS BY YEAR'S END
c06c022o POLAND'S OPPOSITION KNOWN TO THE WORLD AS SOLIDARITY SPEAKS UP LOUDLY FOR DEMOCRACY
c06c022p LECH WALESA WHO INSPIRES IT HAS EVEN FORCED THE POLISH AUTHORITIES LATELY TO CONSIDER LISTENING TO WHAT HE HAS TO SAY
c06c022q BUT POLAND HAS ANOTHER OPPOSITION ONE DOESN'T HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT
c06c022r HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
c06c022s TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
c06c022t THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
c07c0201 BEFORE BEING HALTED ON THE TORONTO STOCK EXCHANGE MONDAY THE VOTING SHARES TRADED AT FORTY ONE DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS
c07c0202 THE SHARES RESUMED TRADING YESTERDAY
c07c0203 THE VOTING SHARES CLOSED AT SEVENTY DOLLARS UP TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS
c07c0204 THE CLASS A SHARES CLOSED AT FOURTEEN POINT THREE SEVEN FIVE DOLLARS UP SIXTY SEVEN POINT FIVE CENTS
c07c0205 THE NIGHT BEFORE HE HAD WORKED UNTIL THREE A. M. FILLING THE ROOM WITH HIS EQUIPMENT
c07c0206 BUT AS HIS MORNING CLASS STARTS HE IS BUBBLING
c07c0207 COMPUTERS ARE VERY ADDICTIVE
c07c0208 THEY'RE LIKE DRUGS HE PROMISES
c07c0209 MR. JACOBS HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS TO LEAVE ON FEBRUARY FIRST TO FORM A NEW FIRM WITH ANOTHER PARTNER JOHN F. GERARD
c07c020a SEVERAL STAFF MEMBERS PLAN TO LEAVE WITH HIM
c07c020b MR. JACOBS SAID HIS DEPARTURE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FIRM'S PROBLEMS
c07c020c I'M NOT A BIG FIRM KIND OF GUY HE SAID
c07c020d I DON'T WANT TO LIVE BY CONSENSUS
c07c020e THE ACCORD MOST LIKELY WOULD INCLUDE SOME PRIVATE AGREEMENT AMONG MINISTERS ON HOW FAR UP OR DOWN THESE RATES CAN MOVE AND STILL BE ACCEPTABLE
c07c020f BUT OFFICIALS SAID IT IS UNLIKELY THESE LIMITS WOULD BE MADE PUBLIC
c07c020g AND IT ISN'T KNOWN YET WHETHER THE MAJOR POWERS WOULD PLEDGE TO INTERVENE IN CURRENCY MARKETS IF EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO EXCEED THOSE LIMITS
c07c020h AS MODEST AS THE MEASURES ARE EVEN THEY WON'T BE ADOPTED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
c07c020i THE TAX CUTS ACCEPTED BY THE COALITION PARTIES HAVE BEEN LINKED TO CUTBACKS IN FEDERAL SUBSIDIES
c07c020j SUCH REDUCTIONS COULD RILE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS AND UNDERMINE PARLIAMENTARY SUPPORT FOR THE ENTIRE TAX PROGRAM
c07c020k MOREOVER ANY TAX REFORM MUST CLEAR PARLIAMENT'S UPPER HOUSE THE BUNDESRAT WHERE THE RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION CLINGS TO A MAJORITY
c07c020l TRADING VOLUME HAS BEEN LETHARGIC FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS PARTLY REFLECTING CONFUSION ABOUT THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
c07c020m IMPORTANT CLUES ARE EXPECTED TO EMERGE FRIDAY WHEN THE LABOR DEPARTMENT REPORTS EMPLOYMENT FIGURES FOR FEBRUARY
c07c020n MANY ANALYSTS EXPECT THE STATISTICS TO INDICATE THAT THE ECONOMY REMAINS WEAK AND THAT LOWER INTEREST RATES LIE AHEAD
c07c020o BUT THE EMPLOYMENT STATISTICS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND INDIVIDUAL ESTIMATES VARY WIDELY
c07c020p CLEVELAND CONFRONTED SCANDALS SWIFTLY AND WITH UNCOMMON CANDOR CONCEDING FROM THE OUTSET FOR EXAMPLE HIS AFFAIR WITH MARIA HALPIN ONCE IT WAS EXPOSED
c07c020q YET HE WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO CONCEAL HIS CANCER SURGERY
c07c020r MR. REAGAN ON THE OTHER HAND EXPOSED HIS MALIGNANT BOWELS TO THE NATION BUT ONLY GRUDGINGLY TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE IRAN CONTRA FIASCO
c07c020s FLOATING FAILS WHEN GOVERNMENTS TRY TO ESCAPE FROM THE VERDICT OF THE EXCHANGE MARKETS ON THEIR POLICIES BY RESORTING TO DIRECT CONTROLS OVER TRADE AND CAPITAL FLOWS
c07c020w THE STORY GETTING INTO THE SET THOUGH COMIC IN TONE IS ABOUT A WOMAN SELLING HER SOUL FOR THE WORLD
c07c020x IT IS HILARIOUS AND PAINFUL ESPECIALLY THE KICKER AT THE END AND IT IS THE ONLY STORY HERE THAT DOES NOT READ LIKE NEWS FROM THE NEXT COUNTY
c07c020z RENT CONTROL REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF LOW COST HOUSING AND EVEN IN PLACES SUCH AS NEW YORK CITY PRICES EVEN MIDDLE CLASS RENTERS OUT OF THE MARKET
c07c0210 BUT TWO WRONGS DO NOT MAKE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT
c07c0211 NEXT TERM THE SUPREME COURT WILL RULE ON A SAN JOSE RENT CONTROL LAW THAT FORCES LANDLORDS TO CHARGE LESS RENT TO LOWER INCOME TENANTS
c07c0212 A FREER PROPERTY MARKET WILL EXPAND NOT CONTRACT HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE POOR
c07c0213 PRESIDENT HUSSEIN'S DOMESTIC STRATEGY AIMED AT SAVING HIS OWN SKIN HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLY MORE SUCCESSFUL
c07c0216 IN THE MILITARY OR IN ANY APPOINTED LEADERSHIP POSITION YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY BY THE JOB YOU HOLD HE SAYS
c07c0217 IN POLITICS WHETHER YOU'RE RUNNING FOR OFFICE SEEKING A CLAIM OR APPROBATION YOU'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHOM YOU WOULDN'T TOLERATE FOR THIRTY SECONDS
c07c0218 YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO TOLERATE FOOLS
c07c0219 THE ANNOUNCEMENT WOULD CAP A HIGHLY PUBLICIZED SEARCH FOR A POSSIBLE NEW HOME
c07c021a IT ALSO WOULD REPRESENT A MAJOR VICTORY FOR NEW YORK CITY WHICH HAS BEEN FIGHTING TO KEEP COMPANIES FROM FLEEING THE CITY
c07c021b N. B. C. HAD BEEN CONSIDERING MOVING SOME OR ALL OF ITS FACILITIES TO NEW JERSEY
c07c021c WE WANT MORE INSTITUTIONAL ASSETS SAYS A KEMPER SPOKESWOMAN
c07c021d WE THINK THE BUSINESS HOLDS CONSIDERABLE PROMISE FOR THE FUTURE SHE ADDS AND WE THINK CITICORP IS A CAPABLE ORGANIZATION
c07c021f FIRST BOSTON AND XEROX HAD NO COMMENT
c07c021g DRAWING ON HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF DAYS OF METICULOUS OBSERVATION MS. MOSS INTRODUCES HER DISCUSSIONS OF ONE SUBJECT OR ANOTHER WITH TRUE STORIES BUILT ON REAL EXPERIENCE
c07c021h SOMETIMES THE NARRATIVE IS CLEARLY STRAIGHT FIRSTHAND REPORTAGE
c07c021i OTHER TIMES IT IS A COMPOSITE RENDERING OR AN IMAGINATIVE RECONSTRUCTION
c07c021j MR. TANAKA WAS ONE OF THE FIRST SCIENTISTS TO RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL OF SUPERCONDUCTORS WHICH ARE SUBSTANCES THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRICITY WITH NO RESISTANCE AND THUS NO LOSS OF POWER
c07c021k IF MADE PRACTICAL THEY COULD BRING SPECTACULAR CHANGES TO ALMOST ANY ELECTRICAL PRODUCT OR PROCESS
c07c021l THAT COULD MEAN VASTLY FASTER AND MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS SUCH AS COMPUTERS CARS AND HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES
c07c021m BUT UNTIL THE RECENT BREAKTHROUGH SUPERCONDUCTORS HAD TO BE CHILLED TO A HOPELESSLY LOW TEMPERATURE TO WORK SO EXCEPT FOR A FEW APPLICATIONS THERE REALLY WAS NO TECHNOLOGY
c07c021n ANOTHER POTENTIAL POINT OF CONTENTION IS THE E. C.'S PLAN TO ALLOW THE FREE FLOW OF PEOPLE ACROSS BORDERS
c07c021o SWITZERLAND ALREADY HAS ATTRACTED ONE MILLION RESIDENT ALIENS A PORTION OF ITS POPULATION GREATER THAN IN ANY E. C. STATE EXCEPT LUXEMBOURG
c07c021p MOST SWISS THINK THAT THAT IS ENOUGH AND THE COUNTRY HAS IMPOSED FOREIGN WORKER QUOTAS SO STRICT THAT SKILLED LABOR IS IN SHORT SUPPLY
c07c021q YET IF SWITZERLAND CLOSES ITS DOORS TO MORE E. C. NATIONALS SWISS WHO WORK IN THE E. C. MAY FIND THEMSELVES LESS WELCOME
c07c021r MR. HARMON ESTIMATES THAT BETWEEN TEN PERCENT AND FIFTEEN PERCENT OF ZAYRE'S THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT STORES WILL BE CLOSED IN THE REVAMPING
c07c021s MANY MORE STORES WILL BE REMODELED
c07c021t THE EFFORT WILL PARALLEL ONE ALREADY UNDER WAY AT ZAYRE
c07c021u THEIR PLAN IS THE RIGHT PLAN MR. HARMON SAID
c07c021v BUT IT WOULD HAVE MEANT A LOT OF EXPENSES AND A LOT OF LOSSES FOR A COMPANY ALREADY RACKED WITH LOSSES
c07c021w I DOUBT THAT I OR ANY OTHER AMERICAN WILL EVER AGAIN SEE TAX RATES AS LOW AS THEY ARE NOW MR. SIMMONS SAID
c07c021x SO HE SOLD ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SHARES HE ACQUIRED EARLIER THIS YEAR BY EXERCISING AN OPTION
c07c021y ABOUT HALF THE PROCEEDS WILL GO TO PAY TAX ON THE GAIN HE SAID
c07c021z THAT'S WHAT WALL COVERING INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES DO
c07c0220 LAST WEEKEND AT AN INDUSTRY GATHERING HERE NEARLY FIFTY OF THEM DRESSED UP IN FABRICS DESIGNED FOR BEDROOM BATHROOM AND OTHER HOUSEHOLD WALLS
c07c0221 THEN AFTER A FEW ROUNDS OF DRINKS THEY STAGED A FASHION SHOW FOR HUNDREDS OF GUESTS
c07c0222 THE TREASURY IS SCHEDULED TO ANNOUNCE DETAILS OF ITS QUARTERLY FINANCING OPERATION NOVEMBER SECOND
c07c0223 IT USUALLY CONSISTS OF THREE YEAR NOTES TEN YEAR NOTES AND THIRTY YEAR BONDS
c07c0224 BUT THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY CLOSE TO REACHING ITS LIMITS ON ISSUING LONG TERM DEBT AND THUS HAS ASKED CONGRESS TO INCREASE ITS AUTHORITY
c07c0225 CONGRESS STILL HASN'T COMPLETED WORK ON THE ISSUE WHICH IS PART OF THE TAX BILL PASSED LATE TUESDAY BY THE SENATE
c07c0226 THE REHABILITATION PROCESS IS CERTAINLY FURTHER ALONG
c07c0227 THERE'S LESS LOOKING BACK AND MORE LOOKING FORWARD NOW MR. LEFEVRE SAID
c07c0228 PEOPLE ARE FOCUSING MORE ON THE ELECTION AND THE POST ELECTION PERIOD WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN FOR THE ECONOMY
c07c0229 BUT AFTER FIVE YEARS OF DECLINE UNIT LABOR COSTS HAVE BEGUN TO EDGE UP AMONG MANUFACTURERS
c07c022a WAGES AND BENEFITS THIS YEAR HAVE BEEN RISING AT NEARLY DOUBLE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN'S TWO POINT ONE PERCENT RATE SLIGHTLY EXCEEDING THE GAIN IN PRODUCTIVITY
c07c022b AS A RESULT MANUFACTURERS' UNIT LABOR COSTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER CREPT UP ZERO POINT SEVEN PERCENT FROM A YEAR EARLIER THE LABOR DEPARTMENT REPORTED YESTERDAY
c07c022c MR. JORDAN WAS AWARDED DAMAGES OF NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS AND A PUNITIVE AWARD OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
c07c022d THE JURY ALSO FOUND THAT CLAYTON UNDER MISSOURI COMMON LAW HAD BREACHED ITS FIDUCIARY DUTIES BECAUSE OF SELF DEALING
c07c022e THE APPEALS COURT UPHELD THE LOWER COURT IN OCTOBER NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
c07c022f ISRAELI SOLDIERS BLOCKED ABOUT ONE THOUSAND PALESTINIANS FROM ENTERING ISRAEL IN A TEST OF NEW IDENTIFICATION CARDS
c07c022g BEGINNING TODAY ARABS CAN'T LEAVE THE OCCUPIED GAZA STRIP WITHOUT THE MAGNETIZED PLASTIC CARDS
c07c022h THE MOVE HAS INTENSIFIED THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN ISRAELI AUTHORITIES AND PALESTINIAN LEADERS
c08c0201 TO CURB DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION AND SALVAGE THE TRADE SURPLUS BRAZIL'S ECONOMIC PLANNERS RECENTLY IMPOSED A TOUGH PACKAGE OF TAX AND PRICE INCREASES
c08c0202 THE RESULT BRAZILIANS LAST WEEK RIOTED IN THE STREETS OF BRASILIA IN THE WORST VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL IN ITS TWENTY SIX YEAR HISTORY
c08c0203 AND A GENERAL STRIKE HAS BEEN TENTATIVELY SET FOR DECEMBER TWELFTH
c08c0204 SPECULATION HEATS UP ON VOLCKER'S FUTURE
c08c0207 BUYING CORPORATE ZEROS FOR AN I. R. A. NEUTRALIZES THEIR MOST OBVIOUS DISADVANTAGE THE TAX TREATMENT
c08c0208 WITH RARE EXCEPTIONS SUCH BONDS TRIGGER PERSONAL INCOME TAX EACH YEAR ON THE THEORETICAL ACCUMULATION OR ACCRETION OF INTEREST
c08c0209 THAT MEANS INVESTORS PAY TAX ON MONEY THEY HAVEN'T YET RECEIVED
c08c020a IF THE BONDS ARE BOUGHT FOR AN I. R. A. HOWEVER NO TAX IS DUE UNTIL THE MONEY IS WITHDRAWN
c08c020c DEMOCRATIC SENATOR HEFLIN BLUNDERS BY PREMATURELY DISCUSSING INDICTMENTS
c08c020e HIS FIRST TEST ON THAT ISSUE WILL BE WHETHER HE CAN PERSUADE THE OPPOSITION TO FIELD A CANDIDATE AGAINST HIM
c08c020f THE CHIEF OPPOSITION PARTY THE REUNIFICATION AND DEMOCRACY PARTY LED BY KIM YOUNG SAM HAS VOWED IT WON'T PARTICIPATE IN ANY ELECTION UNDER THE CURRENT CONSTITUTION
c08c020g IT AND THE NATIONAL COALITION FOR A DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTION A NEWLY FORMED ALLIANCE OF RELIGIOUS AND DISSIDENT GROUPS ARE ORGANIZING TOMORROW'S OPPOSITION RALLIES
c08c020h THOSE CREDITORS INCLUDE MULTILATERAL AGENCIES LATIN AMERICAN AND SOME EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS AND SHORT TERM COMMERCIAL BANK CREDITORS AND SUPPLIERS
c08c020i PERU RECENTLY RESUMED DEBT PAYMENTS TO THE INTER AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
c08c020j BUT THERE AREN'T ANY CURRENT PLANS TO RESUME PAYMENTS TO THE WORLD BANK OR THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE ADVISER SAID
c08c020k SHARON'S BOARD FOUGHT THE ACQUISITION VIGOROUSLY TO NO AVAIL
c08c020l EVENTUALLY SHARON SHAREHOLDERS TENDERED EIGHTY SIX PERCENT OF THEIR SHARES GIVING N. V. F. CONTROL
c08c020m AT THE FIRST BOARD MEETING UNDER MR. POSNER SIX DIRECTORS RESIGNED
c08c020n AN EMBITTERED MONSIEUR PERRAULT LEFT THREE MONTHS LATER
c08c020o DUKE POWER COMPANY CHARLOTTE N. C. CONSIDERED ONE OF THE NATION'S MOST EFFICIENT NUCLEAR OPERATORS SAYS IT'S INTERESTED IN RESTARTING AND RUNNING RANCHO SECO
c08c020p THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST TIME ONE UTILITY ACQUIRED OPERATING RESPONSIBILITY FOR AN ENTIRE NUCLEAR PLANT LONG RUN BY ANOTHER UTILITY
c08c020q IT OPENS THE POSSIBILITY THAT MORE SUCH MOVES COULD OCCUR IN THE FUTURE
c08c020r WHAT'S MORE A FURTHER DROP IN THE DOLLAR COULD HAVE THE VERY RESULT MR. BAKER SEEKS TO AVOID HIGHER INTEREST RATES
c08c020s IN ORDER TO KEEP PERSUADING FOREIGN INVESTORS TO HOLD CHEAPER DOLLARS THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST KEEP U. S. INTEREST RATES HIGHER THAN THOSE ABROAD
c08c020t AN EVEN WEAKER DOLLAR COULD REQUIRE HIGHER RATES
c08c020u IDEALLY A CAMPAIGN'S FREE MEDIA AND PAID MEDIA MESH SEAMLESSLY ONE REINFORCING THE OTHER
c08c020v PRESIDENT REAGAN'S NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR REELECTION EFFORT MAY HAVE SET A NEW STANDARD IN THIS REGARD
c08c020w RALLIES WERE METICULOUSLY STAGED TO REINFORCE THE CAMPAIGN'S MESSAGE OF PATRIOTISM AND OPTIMISM
c08c020x THE RESULT WAS NEWS FOOTAGE THAT LOOKED LIKE THE CAMPAIGN'S COMMERCIALS
c08c020y MR. EISNER ALSO ENJOYED A FIFTY SIX POINT NINE MILLION DOLLAR PAPER PROFIT ON OPTIONS HE HOLDS ON STOCK OF THE BURBANK CALIFORNIA ENTERTAINMENT CONCERN
c08c020z HE IS CURRENTLY ENTITLED TO BUY ABOUT ONE POINT TWO MILLION DISNEY COMMON SHARES AT ABOUT FOURTEEN DOLLARS THIRTY SIX CENTS A SHARE
c08c0210 WHEN HIS SIX YEAR EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT EXPIRES IN NINETEEN NINETY MR. EISNER WILL HAVE ACQUIRED OPTIONS TO PURCHASE TWO MILLION SHARES
c08c0211 IN NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING YESTERDAY DISNEY STOCK CLOSED AT SIXTY POINT EIGHT SEVEN FIVE DOLLARS UP THIRTY SEVEN POINT FIVE CENTS
c08c0212 INVESTORS REACTED FAVORABLY TO THE PROPOSED COMBINATION
c08c0213 IN NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING YESTERDAY BELLSOUTH'S STOCK ROSE SEVENTY FIVE CENTS TO CLOSE AT THIRTY NINE POINT SIX TWO FIVE DOLLARS
c08c0214 IN NATIONAL OVER THE COUNTER TRADING MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS' CLASS B. SHARES ROSE TO TWENTY THREE DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS UP THREE DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS
c08c0215 KAISER'S PRESENT VALUE IS EQUALLY UNCERTAIN THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT ITS NET WORTH IS AT LEAST A NEGATIVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
c08c0216 IN ITS LAWSUITS AGAINST FORMER MANAGEMENT THE COMPANY IS SEEKING DAMAGES OF MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR ALLEGED SELF DEALING AND MISMANAGEMENT
c08c0217 IN THE PROCESS THE SUITS ALLEGE ASSETS WERE OVERSTATED AND LIABILITIES UNDERSTATED
c08c0218 DOW PRESIDENT FRANK POPOFF SAID IN A STATEMENT THAT BOTH PRICE AND VOLUME INCREASES BOLSTERED EARNINGS
c08c0219 THE COMPANY'S STRONG COST CONTAINMENT EFFORTS ALSO HELPED
c08c021a COSTS REMAIN STABLE VOLUME HAS INCREASED AND THERE IS NO WEAKNESS APPARENT IN EITHER THE PRODUCT LINES OR GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS MR. POPOFF SAID
c08c021b FRENCH PRESIDENT MITTERRAND NAMED A LONGTIME SOCIALIST RIVAL MICHEL ROCARD AS PRIME MINISTER
c08c021c THE FORMER AGRICULTURE MINISTER KNOWN FOR HIS FREE MARKET VIEWS SUCCEEDS JACQUES CHIRAC WHO RESIGNED FOLLOWING HIS DEFEAT IN PRESIDENTIAL BALLOTING
c08c021d MITTERRAND IS SEEKING TO REALIGN FRANCE AROUND THE CENTER LEFT
c08c021e ALL THIS REFLECTS A MOOD OF TRANSITION AND UNCERTAINTY THAT HAS GRIPPED BRITAIN'S PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED THEATER IN RECENT YEARS
c08c021f FRETTING ABOUT FINANCES MOST COMPANIES ARE TAKING FEWER CREATIVE RISKS
c08c021g AUDIENCES IN TURN HAVE GROWN MORE CONSERVATIVE
c08c021h YET THERE'S MORE WORK PERFORMED NOW THAN IN YEARS MAINLY TO KEEP REVENUES FLOWING
c08c021i BUT AS THE DIRECT MAIL FIELD GROWS MORE CROWDED COMPANIES MUST BE CLEVER TO CUT THROUGH THE CLUTTER
c08c021k MERRILL LYNCH AND COMPANY SAYS IT GETS FIVE TIMES AS MANY RESPONSE CALLS WHEN ITS MAIL LOOKS URGENT LIKE A TELEGRAM
c08c021l HOUSEHOLD FINANCE COMPANY A UNIT OF HOUSEHOLD INTERNATIONAL COMPANY EXPERIMENTS WITH DIFFERENT COLORED ENVELOPES AND SNAZZY TEASER COPY TO GET CONSUMERS TO OPEN ITS MAILINGS
c08c021n BLAME IT ON A LOCAL NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN ORDINANCE THAT BARS WORLDLY EMPLOYMENT OR BUSINESS EXCEPT WORKS OF NECESSITY AND CHARITY ON SUNDAY
c08c021o RECREATION RELATED BUSINESSES SUCH AS MOVIE THEATERS AND BOWLING ALLEYS ALSO ARE EXEMPT
c08c021p THE PURPOSE OF THE BAN IS TO KEEP DOWN TRAFFIC THE TOWN SAYS
c08c021q E. C. OFFICIALS ARGUE THAT INCREASED CROSSBORDER MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS IN EUROPE HAVE MADE ANTITRUST ISSUES MORE THAN A NATIONAL AFFAIR
c08c021r IN THE IRISH DISTILLERS BID NO SINGLE GOVERNMENT WAS IN A POSITION TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE EUROPEAN WHISKEY MARKET
c08c021s E. C. OFFICIALS SAY WHISKEY PRICES WOULD HAVE RISEN THROUGHOUT THE E. C.
c08c021t NOT SINCE THE NINETEEN THIRTIES HAVE CITIZENS PLACED SO MANY INITIATIVES ON STATE BALLOTS
c08c021u MORE THAN SIXTY BALLOT MEASURES RANGING FROM OPEN PIT MINING TO GOVERNMENT ETHICS TO PAROLE REFORM WILL CONFRONT VOTERS IN MORE THAN HALF THE STATES
c08c021v WHY THE EXPLOSION IN DIRECT DEMOCRACY
c08c021w A BIG REASON WE SUSPECT IS THAT LEGISLATURES ARE INCREASINGLY UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO DEAL WITH ISSUES THAT VOTERS CONSIDER IMPORTANT
c08c021x SUCH PLANS MAKE EDUCATORS CRINGE
c08c021y THEY WORRY THAT A COLLEGE DEGREE COULD BE REDUCED TO A FEW TRIPS TO THE NOTES SUPERMARKET
c08c0220 THE GOVERNMENT SOURCE WHO REQUESTED ANONYMITY SAID THE MEASURE WOULD ALLOW FOR THE CONFISCATION OF FUNDS IN ADDITION TO FINES AND IMPRISONMENT
c08c0221 LOCAL PRESS REPORTS SAID FINES OF UP TO FIFTY MILLION LUXEMBOURG FRANCS ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND PRISON TERMS OF UP TO FIVE YEARS COULD BE IMPOSED
c08c0222 THE PROPOSED LAW IS EXPECTED TO GAIN PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL AND GO INTO EFFECT NEXT YEAR
c08c0223 NOW QUICK RECOGNITION OF LOSSES IS NOT ONLY GOOD INVESTMENT STRATEGY BUT GOOD ECONOMIC STRATEGY
c08c0224 FULL DEDUCTIBILITY WOULD PROMOTE MOBILITY OF CAPITAL AND EFFICIENT PRICING OF ASSETS
c08c0225 IT WOULD OBVIOUSLY PROMOTE MORE VENTURE CAPITAL WITH HIGH GAINS AND HIGH RISKS
c08c0226 MERE INDEXING BY CONTRAST WOULD HELP THE BIG AND DULL INVESTMENTS WITH LOW RISKS AND HUMDRUM REWARDS
c08c0227 BUT IF FULL DEDUCTIBILITY OF LOSSES WOULD BE GOOD FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH IT WOULD BE BAD IN TWO OTHER WAYS
c08c0228 BUT THE LAWMAKERS ACTUALLY SPENT ONLY ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF THE MONEY AUTHORIZED UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF THIS FISCAL YEAR
c08c0229 AND SO FAR HARDLY ANY OF THE PROMISED ADDITIONAL TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN FORTHCOMING
c08c022a WE LOST OUR BILL CONCEDES SENATOR MOYNIHAN A NEW YORK DEMOCRAT
c08c022b ONE STUMBLING BLOCK TO INCREASED COMPETITION IS THE VERTICAL INTEGRATION AND CROSS OWNERSHIP IN THE INDUSTRY
c08c022c CABLE SYSTEMS OFTEN HAVE DEMANDED A STAKE IN THE CHANNELS THEY TRANSMIT
c08c022d AN ENTREPRENEUR IS RELUCTANT TO START AN ALTERNATIVE CABLE SYSTEM IF HE KNOWS THAT HE WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GAIN ACCESS TO PROGRAMMING
c08c022e QUITE POSSIBLY SOME OF THE ANTITRUST ASPECTS OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS DESERVE A LOOK SO IT CAN BE DETERMINED WHETHER THEY ACT TO FURTHER INHIBIT COMPETITION IN THE INDUSTRY
c08c022f PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE SITUATION SAY THE COMPANY AND PILOTS' UNION WERE HOPING TO HAMMER OUT AN AGREEMENT THAT THE OTHER LABOR GROUPS WOULD FIND ACCEPTABLE
c08c022g BUT MR. SCHROEDER'S LETTER SAID THE MACHINISTS WILL NEITHER ACCEPT A FAIT ACCOMPLI NOR BE STAMPEDED INTO UNNECESSARY OR IMPRUDENT ACTION
c08c022h HE ALSO SAID THE MACHINISTS' UNION WILL OPPOSE ANY TRANSACTION THAT DOESN'T GUARANTEE JOB PROTECTION FOR ITS MEMBERS
c09c0201 THE MARKET WAS AIDED BY THE WEEKEND ACCORD BY THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES TO CUT PRODUCTION AND SELL OIL AT FIXED PRICES
c09c0202 EXPECTATIONS THAT OIL PRICES WILL INCREASE BUOYED OIL SHARES
c09c0203 MOREOVER BRITAIN IS A MAJOR OIL PRODUCER ALTHOUGH NOT A MEMBER OF OPEC AND HIGHER OIL PRICES WOULD INCREASE THE COUNTRY'S REVENUE
c09c0204 ALL THE GAINS THAT WE'RE MAKING ARE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SAYS F. JAMES MCDONALD G. M.'S PRESIDENT
c09c0205 THAT MAY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING HAPPENING IN HEAVY INDUSTRY IN THE U. S. TODAY
c09c0206 INDEED THE ERA OF BIG TIME NATIONAL LABOR TALKS IN WHICH UNION AND MANAGEMENT LEADERS BUTT HEADS OVER PENNIES AN HOUR IS WANING
c09c0207 IN HIS NEW JOB MR. DARMAN WILL REPORT TO SHERMAN R. LEWIS JUNIOR AND PETER J. SOLOMON COCHAIRMAN OF SHEARSON LEHMAN'S INVESTMENT BANKING DIVISION
c09c0208 HE WILL CONTINUE TO LIVE IN WASHINGTON
c09c0209 SHEARSON LEHMAN IS A SUBSIDIARY OF NEW YORK BASED AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY
c09c020a SMOKERS ARE FEELING THE HEAT BECAUSE COMPANIES ARE TAKING A HARDER LINE ON SUCH ISSUES AS PRODUCTIVITY RISING MEDICAL COSTS AND THE EFFECTS OF PASSIVE SMOKE
c09c020b ALTHOUGH THERE ARE CONFLICTING CLAIMS ABOUT WHETHER SMOKERS COST EMPLOYERS MORE IN TERMS OF HIGHER INSURANCE RATES AND ABSENTEEISM COMPANIES OFTEN CITE SUCH CONCERNS TO JUSTIFY RESTRICTIVE SMOKING POLICIES
c09c020c <NOISE> IN ADDITION NEW STATE AND LOCAL ORDINANCES AND EMPLOYEE COMPLAINTS PUT SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON MANY COMPANIES
c09c020d ALREADY MR. GORBACHEV HAS INSTITUTED QUALITY CONTROLS AT INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES
c09c020e SINCE JANUARY FIRST A NEWLY CREATED AGENCY HAS BEEN SENDING INSPECTORS TO FACTORIES WITH THE AUTHORITY TO DECLARE GOODS TOO SHODDY FOR SALE TO THE PUBLIC
c09c020f MANAGERS AT THE PLANTS MUST MAKE UP ANY RESULTING LOSSES BY SLASHING BONUSES
c09c020g AT MOST HIGHFLYING TEXAS THRIFTS A FRIEND OF THE BOSS COULD GET MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON A SIGNATURE
c09c020h LOANS COULD EXCEED THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE LAND THANKS TO SOME LIBERAL TEXAS S. AND L. LAWS AND COOPERATIVE APPRAISERS
c09c020i DOWN PAYMENTS WERE CONSIDERED AN UNNECESSARY FORMALITY AND NOBODY SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED CHASING AFTER A BORROWER WHO DIDN'T PAY
c09c020j THE MERGER RESULTS IN SEVERAL CLIENT CONFLICTS
c09c020k PANASONIC COMPANY A BATES CLIENT IS PLANNING TO LEAVE BECAUSE BACKER HANDLES MAGNAVOX MR. SPIELVOGEL SAID

c09c020m <NOISE> ALSO HELENE CURTIS LIMITED A BACKER CLIENT IS PLANNING TO LEAVE BECAUSE BATES HANDLES CARTER WALLACE INCORPORATED MR. SPIELVOGEL SAID
c09c020n HELENE CURTIS BILLS ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH IS EQUAL TO ABOUT HALF OF CARTER WALLACE'S BILLINGS ACCORDING TO INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES
c09c020o IF YOU WANT TO BUY BUY A LITTLE
c09c020p IF YOU WANT TO SELL SELL A LITTLE
c09c020q BUT MODERATION IS THE KEY MS. SAGER SAID

c09c020v THESE AQUATIC EQUIVALENTS OF WIND TUNNELS ARE MINIATURE SWIMMING POOLS WITH CURRENTS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO KEEP EVEN THE STRONGEST SWIMMER TREADING WATER
c09c020w IN TRAINING THE SPEED OF THE CURRENT CAN BE TURNED UP FOR EXAMPLE AS A CONDITIONING EXERCISE
c09c020x AND IT MAKES IT EASIER FOR COACHES TO OBSERVE SWIMMING TECHNIQUES
c09c020y ADVANCING ISSUES AND DECLINERS WERE NECK AND NECK YESTERDAY BUT THE HEAVIEST TRADING WAS AMONG THE ISSUES WITH RISING PRICES
c09c020z SOME FIFTY POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS AT ADVANCING PRICES COMPARED WITH THIRTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION THAT TRADED AT LOWER PRICES
c09c0210 IN ALL A MODERATE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION SHARES TRADED ON NASDAQ YESTERDAY
c09c0211 MR. KEATING SAID MOST OF LINCOLN'S INCREASE IN FOURTH QUARTER NET INCOME CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE BANK'S GROWTH IN ASSETS
c09c0212 AT DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST ASSETS WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED WITH TWO HUNDRED FORTY ONE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR EARLIER
c09c0214 I HAVE NO DOUBT THOUGH THAT THE THRUST OF FED POLICY WILL BE MORE TOWARD EASE THAN RESTRAINT MR. ROBERTSON ADDS
c09c0215 FED OFFICIALS WILL BE MUCH MORE INCLINED TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF EASE
c09c0216 SO I THINK THE FED FUNDS RATE WILL BE AT SIX POINT FIVE OH PERCENT TO SIX POINT SEVEN FIVE PERCENT FOR THE NEXT SIXTY DAYS
c09c0217 ASKED ABOUT THE SITUATION A FIRST BOSTON SPOKESMAN SAID OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CAMPEAU HAS NOT CHANGED
c09c0218 WE ARE CAMPEAU'S BANKER OF RECORD

c09c021a SEPARATELY WALL STREET SPECULATION GREW THAT MEDIA INVESTOR RUPERT MURDOCH WAS CONSIDERING ACQUIRING A STAKE IN LONDON BASED W. P. P.
c09c021b A MURDOCH AIDE SAID THAT MR. MURDOCH HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR A LONG TIME AT THE COMPANY
c09c021c BUT A W. P. P. SPOKESMAN SAID THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO CONTACT AND THERE HAS BEEN NO ACQUISITION OF W. P. P. SHARES BY MURDOCH
c09c021d THE WINNER WILL BE THROWN IMMEDIATELY INTO HIS ROLE AS COMEX AMBASSADOR
c09c021e THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTION HE WILL FLY TO BOCA RATON FLORIDA FOR THE FUTURES INDUSTRY'S ANNUAL CONVENTION

c09c021h IT CONTINUES TO QUIBBLE WITH PRETORIA FOR IGNORING THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS
c09c021i BUT IN A REMARKABLE DEMONSTRATION OF INCONSISTENCY IT NOT ONLY APPLAUDS ISRAEL'S DEAFNESS TO THE P. L. O. IT STUFFS LEGISLATIVE PLUGS IN ITS OWN EARS AS WELL
c09c021j SHORTLY AFTERWARD N. B. C. SAID IT WOULDN'T MOVE TO THE TRUMP SITE

c09c021q ON THE OTHER HAND A TWENTY FOUR PERCENT RISE IN SPENDING FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WAS A LIMITING FACTOR ON PROFIT IN THE LATEST QUARTER
c09c021r HE SAID THE COMPANY WILL ALSO HAVE AN INCREASE IN R. AND D. SPENDING FOR THE FULL YEAR BUT LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR PERCENT
c09c021s CHECKOUT COUNTERS ARE PRIMARY IMPULSE BUYING SITUATIONS SAYS WILLARD BISHOP A FOOD RETAILING CONSULTANT
c09c021t AND THERE'S TREMENDOUS COMPETITION FOR ATTENTION NOT ONLY FROM OTHER MAGAZINES BUT FROM ITEMS LIKE CANDY TOBACCO AND RAZOR BLADES MR. BISHOP ADDS
c09c021u THAT'S WHY MAGAZINE EXECUTIVES SAY COVERS HAVE TO REACH OUT AND GRAB BUYERS
c09c021v BUT SENATOR DAVID BOREN D. OKLAHOMA THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WAS LESS OPTIMISTIC

c09c021z THE SOVIETS HAVE A PRODIGIOUS ANTIAIRCRAFT DEFENSE AND MIGHT COPE WITH MANY OF THE G. L. C. M.S
c09c0220 FOR NOW THOUGH THE PERSHINGS CAN'T BE STOPPED

c09c022f THE OFFICIAL ACKNOWLEDGED BUSINESS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE FREQUENCY OF GOVERNMENT CHANGES IN THE TAX LAW BUT HE DISMISSED THEM
c09c022g STABILITY IS A NICE THING HE SAID
c09c022h BUT IT'S ALWAYS TRUE THAT SYSTEMS WE HAVE IN PLACE HAVE BIASES IN THEM

c0ac020h FOR ONE THING THE STAGGERS ACT NOW ALLOWS LONG TERM CONTRACTS BETWEEN SHIPPERS AND RAILROADS
c0ac020i THAT INCREDIBLY WAS NOT ALLOWED UNDER THE OLD LAW BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD ONCE DECIDED THAT VOLUME DISCOUNTS TO BIG SHIPPERS WERE UNFAIR
c0ac020j <NOISE> IN DRAWING UP CONTRACTS THE RELEVANT FACT IS THAT BOTH THE RAILROAD AND THE UTILITY NEED EACH OTHER

c0ac0228 SOME ANALYSTS SAID MANAGEMENT MIGHT ARRANGE A LEVERAGED BUY OUT OF ITS OWN
c0ac0229 <NOISE> BUT OTHERS VIEWED THAT OPTION AS LEAST LIKELY BECAUSE WEST POINT ALREADY HAS ALMOST ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT FROM THE STEVENS ACQUISITION

c0ic0222 THE DIRT ROAD COMES TO A PAVED INTERSECTION AND MR. KGORI BEGINS A RIGHT TURN
c0ic0223 UP AHEAD HE SPOTS A ROADBLOCK WHERE A WHITE POLICEMAN WITH A DOG IS HOLDING UP THREE BLACKS TRAVELING ON A DONKEY PULLED WAGON
c0ic0225 ACQUIRED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE FRIENDLY REPORTED MODEST GROWTH UNTIL LAST YEAR WHEN LABOR SHORTAGES AND LOWER CUSTOM TRAFFIC TO HURT THE CHAIN
c0ic0226 THE UNIT IMPROVED SALES WITH HIGHER PRICES NEW STORE OPENINGS AND THE ACQUISITION OF TWO SMALL RESTAURANT CHAINS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
c0ic0227 <NOISE> HOWEVER FRIENDLY'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PRETAX OPERATING PROFIT OF FORTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS WAS BELOW THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S FIFTY POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS
c0ic0228 A MORE SYMBOLIC RITUAL PROCEEDS IN A PLANETARIUM LIKE DOME IN THE BASEMENT OF A WESTERN TOKYO PET SHOP
c0ic0229 MOURNERS GAZE UPWARD AT A FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR COMPUTER GENERATED IMAGE OF A GALAXY WHILE MUSIC BLARES
c0ic022a A PULSING BLOB OF LIGHT IN A CLEAR PYRAMID MEANT TO REPRESENT THE PET'S SOUL SHOOTS A SPARK OF LIGHT INTO A STAR
c0ic022b ONE OF THE FOUR BUSINESSES INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION GRANTED TO K. K. R. IS MACMILLAN'S DIRECTORY DIVISION WHICH CONSISTS OF WHO'S WHO AND NATIONAL REGISTER PUBLISHING
c0ic022c THUS IT WASN'T IMMEDIATELY CLEAR WHY INTERNATIONAL THOMSON MIGHT BE LOOKING AT THE OPERATION EVEN THOUGH IT IS INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION
c0ic022d A SPOKESMAN FOR K. K. R. ALSO DECLINED COMMENT
c0ic022e HOWEVER HE LEAVES PRIME AT A DIFFICULT TIME
c0ic022f THE COMPUTER MARKET IS GROWING SLOWLY AND PRIME'S PROPRIETARY SYSTEMS ARE LOSING GROUND TO INDUSTRY STANDARD COMPUTERS THAT USE THE UNIX OPERATING SYSTEM
c0ic022h AS A RETIRED PHYSICIAN I REMAIN CONVINCED THAT THE FIFTY STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS CANNOT POLICE THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AS EFFECTIVELY AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDER ANTITRUST AUTHORITY
c0ic022i TOO MUCH IS AT STAKE TO BELIEVE OTHERWISE
c0ic022j I OPPOSE FEDERAL REGULATIONS IN PRINCIPLE EXCEPT WHERE SUCH A LARGE AMOUNT OF DISPOSABLE INCOME IS AT STAKE
c0jc0201 AS MODEST AS THE MEASURES ARE EVEN THEY WON'T BE ADOPTED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
c0jc0202 THE TAX CUTS ACCEPTED BY THE COALITION PARTIES HAVE BEEN LINKED TO CUTBACKS IN FEDERAL SUBSIDIES
c0jc0203 SUCH REDUCTIONS COULD RILE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS AND UNDERMINE PARLIAMENTARY SUPPORT FOR THE ENTIRE TAX PROGRAM
c0jc0204 MOREOVER ANY TAX REFORM MUST CLEAR PARLIAMENT'S UPPER HOUSE THE BUNDESRAT WHERE THE RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION CLINGS TO A MAJORITY
c0jc0205 SOME EXPERTS SAY THAT BECAUSE OF SWEEPING TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY COULDN'T BE RE REGULATED EVEN IF PEOPLE WANTED
c0jc0208 ALTHOUGH SUBSTANTIAL NEW TAXES ARE UNLIKELY THIS YEAR THE CURRENT DEBATE IS IMPORTANT
c0jc0209 DEMOCRATS LIKE HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER JAMES WRIGHT AND MAJORITY WHIP TONY COELHO BELIEVE THEY CAN CONVINCE AMERICANS THAT PRESIDENT REAGAN HAS BEEN TOO KIND TO THE RICH
c0jc020a HOW THAT POLITICAL STATEMENT IS RECEIVED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND HOW IT PLAYS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ELECTIONS COULD DETERMINE THE NATURE OF FUTURE TAX INCREASES
c0jc020b BUT SIX YEARS OF HUGE TRADE DEFICITS AND BUDGET DEFICITS HAVE CHANGED ALL THAT
c0jc020c BY THE END OF LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT SAYS FOREIGNERS HELD TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS MORE IN U. S. ASSETS THAN AMERICANS HELD OVERSEAS
c0jc020d SOME ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS DOUBT THE ACCURACY OF THOSE NUMBERS BUT NO ONE QUESTIONS THE TREND
c0jc020e FOR JACK MORRIS OF MINNEAPOLIS THE TAKEOVER BOOM HAS FINANCED HIS CHILDREN'S EDUCATION AND COST HIM HIS OLD JOB
c0jc020f THE FORMER INVESTOR RELATIONS OFFICIAL AT GULF OIL CORPORATION OWNED ONE THOUSAND SHARES OF THE PITTSBURGH OIL GIANT
c0jc020g BUT IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AS CHEVRON CORPORATION MANEUVERED TO ACQUIRE GULF MR. MORRIS TRANSFERRED ALL HIS GULF STOCK INTO FOUR TRUST ACCOUNTS FOR HIS DAUGHTERS
c0jc020i THIS IS A LANDFILL BUT NO ORDINARY ONE
c0jc020j AT THE SITE ARE STATE OF THE ART ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS THAT ARE TREATING WASTE WATER DETECTING HAZARDOUS WASTES AND PROTECTING AGAINST LEACHING OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES
c0jc020k BROKERAGE SOURCES SAID JAPANESE INVESTMENT TRUSTS ENTERED THE MARKET IN THE AFTERNOON TO HELP NUDGE SHARE PRICES HIGHER FOLLOWING THE MORNING DECLINE

c0jc020n THE EXCHANGE WAS CLOSED SATURDAY AND IS CLOSED MONDAY FOR A NATIONAL HOLIDAY
c0jc020o YOU DIDN'T HAVE PEOPLE HITTING THE SILKS ON THIS SAID JOHN KEEFE AN ANALYST FOR DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED NEW YORK
c0jc020p YOU HAD TO EXPECT HIGHER REDEMPTIONS GIVEN ALL THE DIFFICULTY IN THE MARKET
c0jc020q BUT IT WAS CONTAINED FAIRLY WELL
c0jc020r MR. PEABODY AND OTHERS WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE BANK PURSUE ADDED CAPITAL AND DISPOSE OF TROUBLED LOANS MORE AGGRESSIVELY
c0jc020s FIRST REPUBLIC HOWEVER INSISTS THAT IT ISN'T IN ANY DANGER
c0jc020t IT'S A LONG BALL GAME AND WE'RE THROUGH A QUARTER HERE MR. FRONTERHOUSE SAYS
c0jc020u YOU JUST HAVE TO TAKE A LONGER VIEW
c0jc020v THE FIRST WAVE OF LAYOFFS BEGAN MONDAY WHEN ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EMPLOYEES WERE LAID OFF AT THE FIRM'S DATA PROCESSING CENTER IN SOMERSET N. J.
c0jc020w THE CENTER EMPLOYS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE
c0jc020x ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES WERE LAID OFF YESTERDAY AT MERRILL'S HEADQUARTERS BUILDING
c0jc020y THE CUTS INVOLVED THE SECURITIES RESEARCH AND ECONOMICS DEPARTMENTS AND ONE OF THE FIRM'S LIBRARIES WHICH WAS CLOSED OFFICIALS SAID
c0jc020z STILL DAIMLER EXECUTIVES HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN THEIR NEW CHAIRMAN SOMETHING THEY NEVER HAD IN MR. BREITSCHWERDT
c0jc0210 THINGS ARE MOVING AHEAD AGAIN SAYS ONE PLANT MANAGER
c0jc0211 REUTER IS DECISIVE AND HE INSPIRES A LOT OF CONFIDENCE
c0jc0212 SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FRANK CARLUCCI HAS SAID I THINK A SMALLER MORE EFFECTIVE FORCE IS A MUCH BETTER DETERRENT THAN A LARGER LESS EFFECTIVE FORCE
c0jc0213 PROBABLY TRUE
c0jc0214 BUT THE BUDGET RULES OUT THE BEST OPTION WHICH IS A LARGER MORE EFFECTIVE FORCE
c0jc0215 MR. REAGAN VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED ATTORNEY GENERAL EDWIN MEESE WHO IS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR HIS ROLE IN ADVANCING A MIDDLE EAST OIL PIPELINE ADVOCATED BY ONE OF MR. MEESE'S FRIENDS
c0jc0216 MR. REAGAN SAID HE COULDN'T REMEMBER BEING TOLD ANYTHING ABOUT THE PIPELINE AND EXPRESSED EVERY CONFIDENCE IN MR. MEESE'S INTEGRITY
c0jc0217 HE ALSO CRITICIZED THE LYNCH MOB ATMOSPHERE THAT HAS ACCOMPANIED INVESTIGATIONS OF HIS AIDES
c0jc0218 KAISER'S PRESENT VALUE IS EQUALLY UNCERTAIN THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT ITS NET WORTH IS AT LEAST A NEGATIVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
c0jc0219 IN ITS LAWSUITS AGAINST FORMER MANAGEMENT THE COMPANY IS SEEKING DAMAGES OF MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR ALLEGED SELF DEALING AND MISMANAGEMENT
c0jc021a IN THE PROCESS THE SUITS ALLEGE ASSETS WERE OVERSTATED AND LIABILITIES UNDERSTATED
c0jc021b DUKAKIS DEFEATED JACKSON BY A THREE TO TWO MARGIN IN SATURDAY'S ARIZONA PRESIDENTIAL CAUCUSES
c0jc021c THE MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR WON TWENTY TWO DELEGATES TO THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION IN JULY
c0jc021d JACKSON RECEIVED FOURTEEN DELEGATES AND GORE GOT NONE
c0jc021e ALL THREE CANDIDATES CONTINUED CAMPAIGNING IN NEW YORK FOR TOMORROW'S PRIMARY ELECTION
c0jc021f JOHN R. DEMPSEY FIFTY FOUR YEARS OLD RESIGNED THOSE POSTS AND AS A DIRECTOR OF THE OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION CONCERN
c0jc021g GLOBAL NATURAL'S CHAIRMAN J. W. MCFARLANE WILL ASSUME THE DUTIES OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE
c0jc021h THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT WILL REMAIN VACANT FOR THE TIME BEING A SPOKESWOMAN SAID
c0jc021i <NOISE> BEFORE THE I. N. F. TREATY WE COULD HAVE COUNTERATTACKED THE SOVIET BASES WITH OUR PERSHING AND GROUND LAUNCHED CRUISE MISSILES G. L. C. M. S.'S
c0jc021j THE SOVIETS HAVE A PRODIGIOUS ANTIAIRCRAFT DEFENSE AND MIGHT COPE WITH MANY OF THE G. L. C. M.S
c0jc021k FOR NOW THOUGH THE PERSHINGS CAN'T BE STOPPED
c0jc021l BUT UNDER THE I. N. F. TREATY BOTH ARE TRADED AWAY
c0jc021m INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS LOOKING FOR SOME EXCITEMENT IN THEIR LIVES AREN'T LIKELY TO BE ENTHRALLED BY MR. BERG'S ADVICE
c0jc021n HE SUGGESTS THAT THEY DROP THEIR HARD EARNED DOLLARS INTO THE MOST CONSERVATIVE OF INVESTMENTS T. BILLS AND SIT TIGHT
c0jc021o THERE'S NO SENSE TRYING TO PLAY GAMES WITH THIS MARKET MR. BERG EXPLAINS
c0jc021p IT MAY BE TRUE THAT FIFTY MILLION FRENCHMEN CAN'T BE WRONG BUT FIFTY MAJOR FORECASTERS CAN BE
c0jc021q WHOSE FAULT IS IT THAT THESE FORECASTERS FAILED TO PREDICT THE STRONG GROWTH RATE IN FIRST QUARTER GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT
c0jc021r POOR GOVERNMENT STATISTICS ACCORDING TO THE WALL STREET JOURNAL SHAKY STATISTICS POSE PERIL FOR FORECASTERS THE OUTLOOK MAY NINTH
c0jc021s AND WHICH STATISTICAL SERIES MISLED THESE SEERS
c0jc021t THE INDEX OF LEADING INDICATORS WE ARE TOLD
c0jc021u MANY PARENTS IMPATIENT FOR CHANGE IN THE SCHOOLS RESPOND BY KEEPING THEIR KIDS OUT OF KINDERGARTEN AN EXTRA YEAR
c0jc021v MOTIVES ARE MIXED
c0jc021w SOME SAY THEY WANT TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN OTHERS ANGLE FOR AN AGE ADVANTAGE THAT WILL VAULT THEIR OFFSPRING TO THE HEAD OF THE CLASS THE FOLLOWING YEAR
c0jc021x MANY SCHOOLS ARE ENCOURAGING HOLDOUTS RESULTING IN WHAT SOME EDUCATORS CALL THE GRAYING OF KINDERGARTEN
c0jc021y TEXAS HAS BOTH WINNERS AND LOSERS THIS YEAR
c0jc021z ITS KIND OF A GOOD NEWS BAD NEWS YEAR SAYS RODNEY MOSIER EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT FOR THE TEXAS WHEAT PRODUCERS ASSOCIATION
c0jc0220 IN SEVERAL AREAS WHERE RAIN HAS BEEN AMPLE TEXAS WHEAT FARMERS HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED THE STATE'S TWENTY NINE BUSHEL PER ACRE AVERAGE
c0jc0221 IF YOU HAVE THE WHEAT THEN PRICES ARE TERRIFIC SAYS MR. MOSIER
c0jc0222 BUT THOSE FARMERS THAT AREN'T GETTING THE YIELDS BECAUSE OF THE DROUGHT LOSE OUT TWICE HE SAYS BECAUSE THE HIGH PRICES ARE CUTTING DOWN ON GOVERNMENT SUPPORT PAYMENTS
c0jc0223 FOR A. B. C. NOW NUMBER TWO A HIT WITH ROSEANNE COULD MEAN A TURNING POINT
c0jc0224 PRODUCER MARCY CARSEY SAYS SHE HAS THE SAME FEELING IN HER GUT AS SHE HAD BEFORE THE DEBUT OF COSBY
c0jc0225 BUT THERE THE SIMILARITY ENDS
c0jc0226 THE COSBY SHOW'S CLARE HUXTABLE IS A LOVING LAWYER AND MATRIARCH IN A TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR SWEATER
c0jc0227 ROSEANNE IS AN ACID TONGUED ASSEMBLY LINE WORKER IN AN OLD SWEATSHIRT
c0jc0228 MS. SAVITCH WAS HYPER AMBITIOUS TROUBLED AND UNPOPULAR
c0jc0229 SHE HAD CHARM IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA AN EXPERTLY CRAFTED FACADE BUT INSIDE SHE WAS IN TURMOIL
c0jc022a SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD THE PEACE IN DEATH THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE IN LIFE BUT FOR THIS BOOK AND ANOTHER ONE ABOUT HER DUE OUT SOON
c0jc022b WHILE SIGNIFICANT AFLATOXIN CONTAMINATION HAS BEEN FOUND REPEATEDLY IN THE SOUTHEAST OUTBREAKS HAVE BEEN RARE IN MOST MIDWEST STATES
c0jc022c AS A RESULT MOST MIDWEST STATES DON'T ROUTINELY TEST CORN FOR AFLATOXIN NOR DO THEY REQUIRE GRAIN MERCHANTS TO TEST FOR THE POISON
c0jc022d WHAT'S MORE MANY STATES SUCH AS SOUTH DAKOTA DON'T BAN THE SALE OF DANGEROUSLY CONTAMINATED CORN WITHIN THEIR BORDERS
c0jc022e <NOISE> OVERALL CONSUMER SPENDING HAS SLOWED SINCE LAST YEAR'S STOCK MARKET CRASH BUT IT'S STILL AT A LEVEL THAT WORRIES SOME ECONOMISTS
c0jc022f CONSUMER CREDIT SLOWED SHARPLY IN JULY REFLECTING SLUGGISH SALES
c0jc022g TOO MUCH SPENDING AT HOME COUPLED WITH HEAVY DEMAND FOR EXPORTS COULD OVERLOAD AN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THAT IS ALREADY RUNNING NEAR CAPACITY
c0jc022h ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COMMODITY COIN IS INDONESIA HURT BY WEAK PETROLEUM PRICES AND LAGGING AGRICULTURAL GROWTH
c0jc022i INDONESIA HAS BOOSTED NON OIL EXPORTS THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME OIL AND GAS WILL ACCOUNT FOR LESS THAN HALF THE NATION'S EXPORT EARNINGS
c0jc022j THE BRIGHT SPOT CONTINUES TO BE MANUFACTURED EXPORTS LED BY PLYWOOD AND TEXTILES
c0kc0201 AS EXPECTED THE BUDGET WILL INCLUDE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL LAST YEAR INCLUDING THE SALE OF THE NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE AND THE BONNEVILLE POWER ADMINISTRATION
c0kc0202 SOME ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESSIONAL AIDES THINK CONGRESS WILL GO ALONG WITH SELLING THE PETROLEUM RESERVE THIS YEAR
c0kc0203 BUT RESISTANCE TO THE BONNEVILLE IDEA WAS SO STRONG THAT LAWMAKERS PASSED A RESOLUTION PROHIBITING THE ADMINISTRATION FROM SPENDING ANY FEDERAL MONEY TO STUDY IT
c0kc0204 SUCH RESULTS ARE CAUSING SOME WALL STREET PROFESSIONALS TO TAKE THE JANUARY INDICATOR LESS SERIOUSLY THAN THEY USED TO
c0kc0205 I'M PUTTING LESS EMPHASIS ON SOME OF THESE TRADITIONAL BAROMETERS SAYS EUGENE PERONI DIRECTOR OF TECHNICAL RESEARCH FOR JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT INCORPORATED IN PHILADELPHIA
c0kc0206 THEY ARE NOT THE MOST SCIENTIFIC THINGS AROUND
c0kc0207 HE PUBLISHES HIS BOOK THE SECRET GUIDE TO COMPUTERS BY HIMSELF
c0kc0208 HE SAYS PRINTING COSTS TWO DOLLARS AND HE CHARGES ONLY EIGHT DOLLARS FOR THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE PAGE VOLUME WHICH HE UPDATES REGULARLY
c0kc0209 HE ESTIMATES HE HAS SOLD ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND COPIES
c0kc020a PAUL FREEDENBERG ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF COMMERCE FOR TRADE ADMINISTRATION TOLD THE SENATE PANEL THAT IRAN CONCEIVABLY COULD OBTAIN SIMILAR COMPUTERS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES
c0kc020b IRAN CAN GET THEM TOMORROW MORNING WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE HE CLAIMED
c0kc020c THE DIGITAL EQUIPMENT PACKAGE IS VALUED AT ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS
c0kc020d BUT OPTIMA WILL COMPETE HEAD ON
c0kc020e THE CARD WILL COST FIFTEEN DOLLARS A YEAR IN ADDITION TO THE FORTY FIVE DOLLARS THAT AMERICAN EXPRESS CHARGES FOR ITS REGULAR CARD
c0kc020f BUT IT WILL EXTEND THIRTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT CREDIT
c0kc020g THE AVERAGE VISA CARD ALSO CARRIES A FIFTEEN DOLLAR ANNUAL FEE BUT IT HAS A STIFFER SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT RATE AND SEVERAL BIG BANKS CHARGE EVEN MORE
c0kc020h NOW THE TWO UNITS ARE FOR SALE FOR FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MAYBE HALF THEIR PEAK VALUES OF THREE YEARS AGO
c0kc020i I CAN'T AFFORD TO KEEP THEM HE SAYS
c0kc020j <NOISE> THE TAX LAWS HAVE CHANGED OUT FROM UNDER ME
c0kc020k <NOISE> MR. TRUMP WASN'T AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT YESTERDAY
c0kc020l INDUSTRY SOURCES HAVE DISPUTED HIS CLAIM THAT HE HOLDS THAT LARGE A GOLDEN NUGGET STAKE AS WELL AS ANY TAKEOVER THREAT
c0kc020m STEPHEN A. WYNN GOLDEN NUGGET'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER HAS DENIED THAT THE BUY BACK IS DEFENSIVE
c0kc020n <NOISE> HE WASN'T AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT YESTERDAY
c0kc020o A DIGITAL SPOKESMAN SAID THE COURT ACTION DOESN'T CHANGE THE STATUS QUO
c0kc020p THE PART OF THE RULING THAT WAS OVERTURNED HASN'T BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE LAST JANUARY WHEN EMULEX OBTAINED THE STAY HE SAID
c0kc020q HE ADDED THAT THE PARAGRAPHS OF THE ORDER THAT WERE UPHELD CONTINUE TO PROHIBIT EMULEX FROM USING TRADE SECRETS THAT DIGITAL SAYS WERE STOLEN FROM IT
c0kc020r CLEARLY SOMETHING IS CHANGING IN EUROPE
c0kc020s IT ISN'T THAT THE WALL IS ABOUT TO FALL ANY TIME SOON
c0kc020t BUT THE SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH SERIOUS EUROPEANS DISCUSS THE PROSPECT VIVIDLY UNDERSCORES THE IMPACT ON WESTERN EUROPE OF MR. GORBACHEV AND HIS REFORM POLICIES
c0kc020u MR. HINZ SAID HOWEVER THAT MR. KEATING HAS PROMISED TO LET HIM RUN LINCOLN AS HE WANTS TO
c0kc020v I DON'T THINK AMERICAN CONTINENTAL WILL INSIST OR DIRECT ME TO DO THINGS WITH LINCOLN THAT I FEEL SHOULD NOT BE DONE MR. HINZ SAID
c0kc020w I THINK THE OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT OF LINCOLN REALIZED THEY HAVE TO BECOME MORE OF A TRADITIONAL THRIFT HE ADDED
c0kc020x INEVITABLY SOME WILL SEEK A FOURTH ALTERNATIVE TO CONTINUE BORROWING FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD MAKING ONLY MARGINAL ADJUSTMENTS IN OUR ECONOMIC POLICIES
c0kc020y EARLIER THIS CENTURY THE BRITISH TAUGHT US THAT DEBT AND LEADERSHIP CANNOT LONG CO EXIST
c0kc020z EVENTUALLY AND THE MARKETS SEEM TO BE SAYING SOONER RATHER THAN LATER WE WILL HAVE TO CHOOSE
c0kc0210 THE ARMY IS LIKELY TO CANCEL PLANS FOR ITS NEW FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS L. H. X. HELICOPTER PROGRAM BECAUSE OF BUDGET CUTS PENTAGON OFFICIALS SAID
c0kc0211 THE HELICOPTER WHICH WAS TO HAVE REPLACED VIETNAM ERA HUEY AND COBRA AIRCRAFT WAS CONSIDERED A CORNERSTONE OF THE ARMY'S MODERNIZATION
c0kc0212 A FINAL DECISION IS EXPECTED TODAY
c0kc0213 DEALERS SAID ACTIVITY WAS SLOW BECAUSE OF THE U. S. HOLIDAY CELEBRATING THE BIRTHDAY OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR
c0kc0214 <NOISE> MOST U. S. BANKS WERE CLOSED ALTHOUGH SEVERAL OF THE LARGER FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPARTMENTS REMAINED OPEN TO SERVICE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS AND TRADE WITH EUROPE
c0kc0215 BUT EVEN THEY WOUND DOWN THEIR TRADING WHEN THE LONDON MARKET SHUT DOWN AROUND NOON E. S. T. OR AFTER THE CHICAGO FUTURES MARKET CLOSED LATER IN THE AFTERNOON
c0kc0216 ADMIRAL CROWE ISN'T DEFENSIVE ABOUT MISTAKES
c0kc0217 IF THERE'S ONE PROFESSION IN WHICH YOU CAN'T MOUNT AN ERROR FREE OPERATION IT'S THE MILITARY HE SAYS
c0kc0218 IN THIS CASE THE J. C. S. CHIEF FEARED THAT CONGRESS MIGHT CURTAIL THE NAVY OPERATION IF THE U. S. REPEATEDLY LOOKED ILL PREPARED
c0kc0219 I HAD REALLY UNDERESTIMATED HOW INVOLVED CONGRESS WOULD GET AND HOW DETERMINED THEY WOULD BE TO POLITICIZE IT HE SAYS
c0kc021a TO PUNISH CURRENCY SPECULATORS THE GOVERNMENT IS ALLOWING PEOPLE TO EXCHANGE A MAXIMUM OF TEN MILLION OLD CORDOBAS
c0kc021b ANYTHING OVER THAT CAN'T BE EXCHANGED BUT MUST BE DEPOSITED IN A BANK ACCOUNT
c0kc021c THE MOVES TOOK EFFECT YESTERDAY
c0kc021d CRAY IS INTERESTED IN RIGHT NOW SELLING ITS STRIPPED DOWN HIGH SPEED BIG MEMORY RACING MACHINES
c0kc021e MR. ROLLWAGEN BELIEVES A MARKET THRESHOLD HAS BEEN CROSSED WITH SUDDENLY A WHOLE NEW FAMILY OF USERS FINDING THAT SUPERCOMPUTERS ARE COST EFFECTIVE
c0kc021f FOR ONE THING THE COST OF COMPUTING POWER IS COMING DOWN
c0kc021g THE WINNER WILL BE THROWN IMMEDIATELY INTO HIS ROLE AS COMEX AMBASSADOR
c0kc021h <NOISE> THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTION HE WILL FLY TO BOCA RATON FLORIDA FOR THE FUTURES INDUSTRY'S ANNUAL CONVENTION
c0kc021i BOTH MEN HAVE RESERVATIONS
c0kc021j THE JANUARY INCREASE FOLLOWED A REVISED DECEMBER EXPANSION OF THREE POINT NINE EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AS FOUR POINT FOUR FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
c0kc021k AUTO LOANS OUTSTANDING INCREASED ONE POINT FIVE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN JANUARY AFTER AN INCREASE OF TWO POINT THREE TWO BILLION DOLLARS THE PREVIOUS MONTH
c0kc021l POINTING TO THE STRONG CAR SALES REPORTED FOR LATE FEBRUARY SEVERAL ECONOMISTS SUGGESTED THE MEASURE WILL AGAIN SHOW AN INCREASE IN THE REPORT RELEASED NEXT MONTH
c0kc021m SO WHAT IS THE OFFICIAL INTERPRETATION
c0kc021n THERE REALLY IS NO SCRIPT FOR OUR BENSON HEDGES ADS SAYS KENNETH OLSHAN CHAIRMAN OF WELLS RICH
c0kc021o WE JUST TOLD THE ACTORS TO DO WHAT THEY WOULD NATURALLY DO AT A BRUNCH
c0kc021p WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID CLICHES
c0kc021q ONE DAY THOSE WORDS HAUNT THIS LAND OF IMMENSE SUFFERING
c0kc021r ONE DAY SAY THE PEASANT FARMERS THE FOURTEEN YEAR BUSH WAR AGAINST ANTI GOVERNMENT REBELS WILL BE OVER
c0kc021s ONE DAY DROUGHT WILL DISAPPEAR FROM OUR LAND
c0kc021t ONE DAY THE ECONOMY WILL RECOVER
c0kc021u <NOISE> ONE DAY WE WILL BE ABLE TO FEED OURSELVES
c0kc021v BUT INVESTORS SOON HAD SECOND THOUGHTS AND DECIDED THAT THE STEELMAKER'S EXORBITANT OPENING PRICE SIGNALED SPECULATIVE EXCESS
c0kc021w SHARES OF POSCO AS POHANG IRON AND STEEL IS KNOWN FELL TO THE LOW THIRTY THOUSAND WON LEVEL
c0kc021x THE SEOUL MARKET'S COMPOSITE INDEX WHICH STOOD AT ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY WHEN POSCO BEGAN TRADING PLUNGED TOWARD SEVEN HUNDRED
c0kc021y MR. LICHTEN DIDN'T RETURN PHONE CALLS SEEKING COMMENT
c0kc021z HOWEVER BANK EXECUTIVES SPECULATE THAT HIS DEPARTURE WAS LINKED TO CHASE'S MERGER LAST DECEMBER OF ITS INVESTMENT BANKING AND COMMERCIAL BANKING FUNCTIONS
c0kc0220 FOLLOWING THE REORGANIZATION MR. LICHTEN BECAME EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT FOR TAX RELATED FINANCINGS AND FOREIGN CORPORATE CLIENTS
c0kc0221 HOW DID THE BOARD VOTE ON THE REDUCTION PLAN
c0kc0222 IT DIDN'T SAYS MR. MILLER
c0kc0223 A TWENTY TWO MEMBER EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE NOW SLASHED TO SEVEN BECAUSE OF RESIGNATIONS HANDLED THE VOTING
c0kc0224 THE PLAN PASSED UNANIMOUSLY
c0kc0225 U. S. OFFICIALS SAID SOVIET REFUSAL TO DESTROY A SIBERIA RADAR COMPLEX IS PROMPTING THE WHITE HOUSE TO CONSIDER EXPANDING STRATEGIC ARMS PROGRAMS
c0kc0226 THE U. S. CONTENDS THE RADAR VIOLATES THE A. B. M. PACT
c0kc0227 THE STEPS BEING WEIGHED INCLUDE REVERSING THE PLANNED DISMANTLING OF THREE NUCLEAR SUBMARINES AND ACCELERATING SPACE WEAPONS TESTING
c0kc0228 TOBACCO HEIRESS DORIS DUKE AGREED TO POST FIVE MILLION DOLLARS NEEDED BY IMELDA MARCOS TO SECURE BAIL ON RACKETEERING CHARGES
c0kc0229 DUKE IS THE DAUGHTER OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN TOBACCO COMPANY MARCOS AND HER HUSBAND THE DEPOSED PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES ARE ACCUSED OF LOOTING MANILA'S TREASURY
c0kc022a HIS ARRAIGNMENT HAS BEEN DELAYED
c0kc022b ON AUGUST TWENTY THIRD THE U. S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA UPHELD THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY'S APPROVAL OF THE PURCHASE OF THE INSURANCE COMPANY
c0kc022c THE COMPTROLLER HAD FOUND THAT MUNICIPAL BOND INSURANCE IS FUNCTIONALLY THE SAME AS BANKS' STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT
c0kc022d HOWEVER THE COURT SAID THAT CITICORP NEEDED THE FED'S PERMISSION AS WELL AS THE COMPTROLLER'S TO MAKE THE ACQUISITION
c0kc022e NEVERTHELESS THE TIGERS HAVE CAUGHT NEW STADIUM FEVER CITING A SHORTAGE OF PREMIUM SEATS AND A MAINTENANCE TAB THAT RUNS FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY
c0kc022f WHILE SOME OF BASEBALL'S BEST SEATS ARE HERE SO ARE SOME OF THE WORST WITH MANY OBSTRUCTED VIEWS
c0kc022g NEARLY HALF OF ITS SEATS ARE IN THE BLEACHERS WITH ONLY TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND BETWEEN FOUL POLES THE FEWEST IN THE MAJORS
c0lc0202 THE AVERAGE FORECAST OF FOURTEEN ECONOMISTS SURVEYED BY DOW JONES CAPITAL MARKETS REPORT IS FOR A RISE OF ZERO POINT NINE PERCENT
c0lc0203 THAT WOULD BE THE THIRD CONSECUTIVE MONTHLY INCREASE AND WOULD FOLLOW A ZERO POINT SIX PERCENT GAIN IN OCTOBER
c0lc0207 RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
c0lc0208 THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT
c0lc0209 THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
c0lc020b THE REASON
c0lc020d IN EXCHANGE FOR GOOD BANKING SERVICE HE FEELS IT'S ONLY REASONABLE TO ALLOW THE BANK A DOLLOP OF LOW COST FUNDS
c0lc020e THE DISPUTE HAS BEEN SIMMERING SINCE JUNE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHEN EXCHANGE MEMBER WILLIAM J. HIGGINS BOUGHT A PORTABLE PHONE
c0lc020f HE WAS QUICKLY BARRED FROM USING IT TOUCHING OFF A SERIES OF APPEALS AND REVIEWS
c0lc020g MICHAEL D. ROBBINS ANOTHER MEMBER LATER MADE A BID TO INSTALL AN OUTSIDE TELEPHONE LINK FROM HIS FLOOR BOOTH
c0lc020h EXCHANGE DIRECTORS WRUNG THEIR HANDS AND CREATED A COMMITTEE ON TELEPHONE ACCESS TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE

c0lc020l THE NEWS MOVED HAL SHARES UP ONE POINT EIGHT SEVEN FIVE DOLLARS IN AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING YESTERDAY TO CLOSE AT TWENTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT SEVEN FIVE DOLLARS
c0lc020m THAT PRICE GIVES THE AIRLINE'S ONE POINT NINE MILLION COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING A MARKET VALUATION OF FIFTY FOUR POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS
c0lc020n HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC SHARES ROSE TWENTY FIVE CENTS TO CLOSE AT TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS IN NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING
c0lc020o BUT IN BOTH CITIES ANALYSTS ARE CURRENTLY STRIKING A MORE CAUTIOUS POSE
c0lc020p NORWAY'S FEARS ARE SHORT TERM PEGGED TO THE RECENT STALL IN THE OIL PRICE RISE
c0lc020q IN SWEDEN THE REASON IS THE APPROACH OF AUTUMN WHEN A NEW ROUND OF UNION WAGE NEGOTIATIONS WILL TAKE THE ECONOMY INTO UNKNOWN TERRITORY AT LEAST TEMPORARILY
c0lc020r A NEW CONFERENCE BOARD SURVEY OF ONE THOUSAND SENIOR EXECUTIVES SHOWS CONFIDENCE UP SHARPLY
c0lc020s THIS IS THE BIGGEST RISE IN CONFIDENCE SENTIMENT IN OVER A YEAR SAYS STEVE MALIN SENIOR ECONOMIST

c0lc020y SALES OF COCAINE PASTE FROM WHICH COCAINE IS REFINED OUTSIDE PERU ARE ESTIMATED AT ONE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR
c0lc020z SEVERAL OWNERS OF CONTEMPORARY ART GALLERIES SAY THEY ARE NERVOUS ABOUT THE AFTERSHOCKS OF THE STOCK MARKET'S FALL BUT THEY STILL HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH DAMAGE
c0lc0210 I'M SURE THIS WILL HAVE SOME EFFECT ON MY BUSINESS SAYS DEALER JOHN WEBER IN NEW YORK
c0lc0211 I CAN ANTICIPATE THAT CORPORATE BUYING OF ART WILL BE AFFECTED DOWN THE PIKE
c0lc0212 BUT I'M NOT JUMPING OUT A WINDOW
c0lc0213 I'VE LIVED THROUGH RECESSIONS BEFORE AND I KNOW THAT TO REAL COLLECTORS ART IS AN OBSESSION
c0lc0215 ART COLLECTORS AND DEALERS HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF LAST NIGHT
c0lc0216 <NOISE> AFTER HIGH PRICES AND FRANTIC BIDDING AT ART AUCTIONS LAST SPRING ABOUT ONE IN FOUR WORKS DIDN'T SELL AT A CONTEMPORARY ART AUCTION AT CHRISTIE'S
c0lc0217 BUT AT LEAST THE MARKET DIDN'T CRASH
c0lc0218 THE AUCTION HOUSE SAID THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE TOP TEN ART WORKS ALL SOLD FOR MORE THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS EACH
c0lc0219 RECORDS WERE SET FOR SIX ARTISTS INCLUDING MARC CHAGALL CLAUDE MONET AND PIERRE AUGUSTE RENOIR
c0lc021a THE TOP PRICE WAS FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A RENOIR PAINTING OF A YOUNG WOMAN
c0lc021b ATTORNEYS FOR THE SECURITIES FIRM HAD REQUESTED THAT THE APPELLATE COURT VOID JUDGE IRVING'S JUDGMENT BUT THE APPELLATE COURT DENIED THAT REQUEST YESTERDAY
c0lc021c A CLERK FOR JUDGE IRVING SAID DONALDSON LUFKIN WILL LIKELY APPEAL THE RULING DIRECTLY TO JUDGE IRVING
c0lc021d A SPOKESWOMAN FOR DONALDSON LUFKIN DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE MATTER
c0lc021e THOSE LANDS HAVE BECOME WORTH MUCH MORE THAN THE TRANSPORTATION AND ENERGY CONCERN NEEDS FOR THE RAILROAD AND THE COMPANY HAD BEEN TRYING TO FREE ITSELF FROM THE LIENS
c0lc021f LAST SPRING BURLINGTON AGREED TO PAY REMAINING BONDHOLDERS A TOTAL OF THIRTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN RETURN FOR PERMISSION TO REMOVE THE COVENANTS
c0lc021g A JUDGE APPROVED THE AGREEMENT IN NOVEMBER AND IT BECAME FINAL JANUARY TWELFTH
c0lc021h TWELVE PHILADELPHIA ANTIQUE DEALERS WERE CHARGED BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WITH ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS
c0lc021i ELEVEN PLEADED GUILTY LAST FALL AND WERE FINED BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND GIVEN PROBATIONARY SENTENCES UP TO THREE YEARS
c0lc021j <NOISE> THE TWELFTH WAS FOUND GUILTY BY A JURY SENTENCED TO THIRTY DAYS OF HOUSE ARREST AND FINED THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
c0lc021k TWO FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD GOVERNORS WAYNE ANGELL AND MARTHA SEGER SAID THEY ARE ENCOURAGED BY THE DOLLAR'S RECENT STABILITY IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS
c0lc021l MR. ANGELL ALSO EXPRESSED OPTIMISM ABOUT THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK THIS YEAR
c0lc021n REGARDLESS OF HOW THE FOREIGN PURCHASES BEGIN THEY OFTEN INVOLVE THE VERY PARTS THAT MAKE WEAPONS PERFORM

c0lc021y IT HAD A SMALL ONE TIME GAIN IN THE QUARTER
c0lc0221 THE REPORT ON PRODUCER PRICES FOR MAY IS WIDELY EXPECTED TO SHOW AN INCREASE OF ZERO POINT FOUR PERCENT
c0lc0222 IF IT COMES IN ZERO POINT FIVE PERCENT OR HIGHER THAT'S GOING TO BE BAD FOR BONDS MR. BOZIAN WARNED
c0lc0223 THE INITIAL UGLINESS WILL BE OVERWHELMED BY THE FORCE OF NEW IDEAS AND A SYNTHESIS OF OLD ONES
c0lc0224 HUNDREDS OF YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WILL EVALUATE WHAT THEY SEE THERE
c0lc0225 THEY WILL BEGIN TO QUESTION AND TO READ AND TO THINK
c0lc0226 YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IT WILL HAPPEN THOUGH IN THE CASE OF MR. DOWNEY'S SHOW IT REQUIRES PHILOSOPHICAL TENACITY
c0lc0227 GIVEN THE PRICE OF THE STOCK IT'S A GOOD USE OF CASH SAID WILLIAM R. YOUNG AN ANALYST WITH THE DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED
c0lc0228 THEY'RE DEFINITELY UNDERVALUED
c0lc0229 FOR A PREMIER CHEMICAL COMPANY TO CARRY SUCH A DISCOUNT NEAR THE END OF AN ECONOMIC CYCLE SEEMS SILLY TO ME
c0lc022a <NOISE> ACQUIRED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE FRIENDLY REPORTED MODEST GROWTH UNTIL LAST YEAR WHEN LABOR SHORTAGES AND LOWER CUSTOMER TRAFFIC HURT THE CHAIN
c0lc022b THE UNIT IMPROVED SALES WITH HIGHER PRICES NEW STORE OPENINGS AND THE ACQUISITION OF TWO SMALL RESTAURANT CHAINS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
c0lc022c HOWEVER FRIENDLY'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PRETAX OPERATING PROFIT OF FORTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS WAS BELOW THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S FIFTY POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS
c0lc022d THE COMPANY SAID THE RESULTS INDICATE ITS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE SALES ARE BEGINNING TO PAY OFF

c0lc022h YOU VENTURE CAPITALISTS ARE ALL ALIKE
c0lc022i YOU'RE TOO DAMN GREEDY SHE COMPLAINED
c0lc022j A MINUTE LATER SHE WAS GONE
c0mc0201 THE IRANIAN CRISIS AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S UNCERTAIN GRIP ON IT HAS REAWAKENED THIS CYNICISM
c0mc0207 HE ARRANGES MATCHES FOR THE BOXERS HE DEVELOPS AND THUS GETS A CUT OF THE PURSE
c0mc020a MR. STEWARD RESIDES IN AN AFFLUENT SECTION OF WEST DETROIT WHERE HE OWNS SEVERAL HOMES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD USING SOME OF THEM TO HOUSE THE FURNITURE HE COLLECTS
c0mc020b <NOISE> BANKS WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES EXCLUDED FROM THE PRIVATE TALKS
c0mc020c STEPHEN D. SUSMAN ONE OF THE HUNTS' LEAD ATTORNEYS SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE DISCUSSIONS UNTIL HE STARTED HEARING THE OTHER BANKS' OBJECTIONS
c0mc020d BUT MR. SUSMAN SAID HE ISN'T TROUBLED BY THE MEETINGS <NOISE>
c0mc020e IT SEEMS LIKE GOOD SENSE TO ME <NOISE>
c0mc020i THE COMMERCIAL PLUGGED AN ANTACID FOR HUMANS
c0mc020m INSTEAD HE SAYS THEY'RE EATING ONLY FOR SENSATION
c0mc020o THE ANSWER IS TO SOME EXTENT DEPENDENT ON HOW DESIRABLE ONE FINDS THE TRADITIONAL FAMILY ARRANGEMENT

c0mc020u IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS AN EXCELLENT QUARTER SAID GAIL LANDIS OF SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN AND COMPANY
c0mc020v SHE NOTED THE STRONG IMPROVEMENTS IN THE COMPANY'S OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN DURING THE QUARTER TO EIGHT POINT EIGHT PERCENT FROM SEVEN POINT FOUR PERCENT LAST YEAR
c0mc020w ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THE QUARTER'S SALES WERE FLAT WHEN CONSIDERING THE ABSENCE OF THE CABLE OPERATIONS
c0mc020y BUT IN RESPONSE TO AN ANALYST'S QUESTION HE SAID EARNINGS OF TWO DOLLARS A SHARE SOUNDS STRONG
c0mc020z <NOISE> HE ALSO WARNED ANALYSTS AGAINST LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR QUARTER AND ISOLATING IT ADDING WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE ANNUAL TREND LINE

c0mc021f D. D. C. CAUSES A PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY TINGLING NUMBING AND PAIN PRINCIPALLY IN THE FEET THAT CAN REQUIRE POTENT PAINKILLERS SUCH AS MORPHINE
c0mc021g IT ISN'T KNOWN WHETHER SUCH SIDE EFFECTS CAN BE REVERSED DOCTOR SOO SAID
c0mc021k WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS AN ATTEMPT TO GET MORE FLEXIBILITY FROM UNIONS TO ALLOW COST REDUCTIONS
c0mc021l THE PROPOSED MERGER OF COMEX AND THE RIVAL NEW YORK MERCANTILE EXCHANGE IS A BIG ISSUE HOWEVER
c0mc021n WE CAN'T CONTINUE AS A METALS EXCHANGE
c0mc021o WE MUST EXPAND THROUGH MERGER MR. HANEMANN SAYS <NOISE>
c0mc021p MR. GARVEY DOESN'T STRESS A NYMEX MERGER NEARLY AS MUCH AS HIS OPPONENT BUT HE SAYS HE'S ONE HUNDRED PERCENT IN FAVOR OF MERGER
c0mc021q JAMES L. WINOKUR OF PITTSBURGH IS AN ART EXPERT AND TRUSTEE OF CARNEGIE INSTITUTE
c0mc021r <NOISE> IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND AGAIN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HE DONATED TEN PERCENT INTERESTS IN FORTY FOUR ART WORKS TO CARNEGIE'S MUSEUM
c0mc021s EACH GIFT ENTITLED IT TO POSSESSION FOR A PROPORTIONAL PART OF THE YEAR BUT THE MUSEUM DIDN'T EXERCISE ITS RIGHT

c0mc021v THE KING'S REQUEST LEFT THE DELEGATES IN A TIGHT SPOT
c0mc021w TO IGNORE JORDAN AND MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL FORMAL CASH PLEDGE TO THE P. L. O. WOULD SIGNAL A SHIFT AWAY FROM MODERATION DIFFICULT FOR THE GULF STATES TO COUNTENANCE
c0mc021x <NOISE> BUT TO FINANCE BOTH JORDAN AND THE P. L. O. RISKED TRIGGERING A CLAMOR FROM OTHER CASH STRAPPED STATES COVERED FROM THE BAGHDAD AGREEMENT SUCH AS LEBANON AND SYRIA
c0mc021y THE APPARENT INCONSISTENCY IS JUSTIFIED MAINTAINED ROBERT BURGER CHEVROLET GENERAL MANAGER GIVEN THE GROWING DIFFICULTY IN LAUNCHING MODELS IN AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE FIELD
c0mc0220 <NOISE> CHEVROLET IS USING THE SAME APPROACH WITH ITS GEO LINE OF IMPORT CARS THAT DEBUTS THIS FALL
c0mc0222 IT USUALLY CONSISTS OF THREE YEAR NOTES TEN YEAR NOTES AND THIRTY YEAR BONDS <NOISE>
c0mc0223 BUT THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY CLOSE TO REACHING ITS LIMITS ON ISSUING LONG TERM DEBT AND THUS ASKED CONGRESS TO INCREASE ITS AUTHORITY
c0mc0224 CONGRESS STILL HASN'T COMPLETED WORK ON THE ISSUE WHICH IS PART OF THE TAX BILL PASSED LATE TUESDAY BY THE SENATE
c0mc0225 <NOISE> KEVIN O'CONNELL SALES MANAGER AT TOYOTA OF ORANGE SAID OCTOBER WAS SLOWER THAN USUAL AT THE BIG SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DEALERSHIP <NOISE>
c0mc0227 THERE'S PROBABLY A FEW PEOPLE WHO COME IN MORE SO THAN IN THE PAST AND SUFFER FROM STICKER SHOCK HE SAID
c0mc0229 BUT BOTH HAVE BEEN HEAVILY DISCOUNTED BY AS MUCH AS NINE DOLLARS A CASSETTE AND BOTH HAVE REBATE OFFERS <NOISE>
c0mc022g WE ARE JUST SELECTING A RANGE OF MANUFACTURERS WHO ARE MAKING THESE GENERIC PRODUCTS
c0mc022i AS A RESULT HE SAID IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THE FED IS GOING TO EASE AT THIS TIME
c0nc0201 LAST WEEK THERE WERE REPORTS THAT AFTER THE OFFERING SHEARSON LEHMAN HAD A BIG UNSOLD CHUNK OF STOCK
c0nc0202 IN A NARROWLY DRAWN STATEMENT VICE CHAIRMAN HERBERT FREIMAN DENIED SHEARSON HAD OFFERED A BLOCK TO SALOMON BROTHERS WHICH MANAGED THE SELLING BROKERS' FLOOR OPERATION
c0nc0203 MR. FREIMAN WOULDN'T ELABORATE
c0nc0204 THE COMPANY SELLS COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRIMARILY TO LEGAL OFFICES

c0nc0208 BELLSOUTH CORPORATION AN ATLANTA BASED REGIONAL TELEPHONE COMPANY IS LETTING N. I. O. S. H. STUDY THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OF ITS FEMALE WORKERS
c0nc0209 BUT THE COMPANY WON'T LET RESEARCHERS ASK WORKERS ABOUT THEIR FERTILITY HISTORY OR THEIR PERCEPTION OF OCCUPATIONAL STRESS A POTENTIAL CAUSE OF MISCARRIAGES
c0nc020a A BELLSOUTH SPOKESMAN SAYS THE COMPANY BELIEVES SUCH QUESTIONS ARE OUTSIDE THE STUDY'S SCOPE
c0nc020b HE TELLS US TO CLOSE OUR EYES AND IMAGINE THE BEACH

c0nc020i JOHN SLOAN'S PEOPLE ARE LARGELY TAKEN FOR GRANTED BUT AS IT HAPPENS THEY HAVE BEEN THE STARS OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES
c0nc020j AS BIG CORPORATIONS HAVE LAID OFF WORKERS BY THE THOUSANDS TO MEET COMPETITIVE PRESSURES SMALL FIRMS HAVE MORE THAN CUSHIONED THE BLOW
c0nc020k THEY HAVE CREATED SOME TEN MILLION NEW JOBS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ACCORDING TO AN ESTIMATE MADE AT LAST YEAR'S WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON SMALL BUSINESS
c0nc020l MOREOVER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IS THE RULE MAINLY BECAUSE SMALL ENTREPRENEURS MAKE THEIR OWN OPPORTUNITIES
c0nc020m BY ONE ESTIMATE WOMEN NOW ACCOUNT FOR HALF OF NEW BUSINESS START UPS IN THE U. S.
c0nc020n THE COMPANY SAID JOY TECHNOLOGIES' PROJECTED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WON'T BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS DUE BEFORE JUNE TWENTIETH NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
c0nc020o AS A RESULT JOY TECHNOLOGIES WILL HAVE TO SELL A NUMBER OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS
c0nc020p THE COMPANY PROJECTED SALES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT OF FIVE HUNDRED TEN MILLION DOLLARS AND IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE OF FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS
c0nc020q LAST MONTH'S SURGE WAS WIDESPREAD WITH AUTO SALES RISING ONE POINT NINE PERCENT BUILDING MATERIALS ONE POINT TWO PERCENT AND FURNITURE CLIMBING ZERO POINT SEVEN PERCENT
c0nc020r THE ONLY NOTICEABLE DECLINES WERE IN RESTAURANTS ZERO POINT SIX PERCENT AND FOOD STORES ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT
c0nc020s EXCLUDING AUTOS SALES ROSE ZERO POINT FOUR PERCENT LAST MONTH
c0nc020t U. S. UTILITIES COULD ALSO INCREASE ORDERS OF FOREIGN URANIUM AHEAD OF ANY TOTAL IMPORT RESTRICTIONS ANALYSTS SAY
c0nc020u URANIUM FROM SOUTH AFRICA FOR EXAMPLE HAS ALREADY FALLEN UNDER ANTI APARTHEID SANCTIONS
c0nc020v BUT LAST YEAR SAID THE URANIUM INSTITUTE U. S. IMPORTS OF SOUTH AFRICAN URANIUM SURGED THREE HUNDRED PERCENT TO MORE THAN THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION POUNDS
c0nc020w ALMOST SIXTY PERCENT OF THE DELIVERIES TOOK PLACE IN DECEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE LAST MONTH BEFORE THE EMBARGO TOOK EFFECT
c0nc020y A SPOKESMAN FOR THE COMPANY SAID SUN IS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING LARGE IN THE AREA OF ENERGY RESERVES
c0nc020z THE SPOKESMAN SAID SUN HAS MORE THAN ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN CAPITAL THAT IT HAS GAINED FROM SPINOFFS AND DIVESTITURES OF COMPANIES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS
c0nc0210 ONE REASON THE RATIOS FELL SO SHARPLY IN THE MONTH HE EXPLAINS IS THAT VOLUME DURING OCTOBER SOARED
c0nc0211 THAT RAISED THE AVERAGE DAY'S TRADING VOLUME
c0nc0212 IN THE COMING MONTH HE PREDICTS SHORT INTEREST RATIOS WILL RISE SINCE AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME HAS SINCE FALLEN
c0nc0213 NO FINAL BUDGET DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE AT THE WHITE HOUSE
c0nc0214 BUDGET DRAFTING IS BEHIND SCHEDULE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES WON'T EVEN SEE O. M. B. RECOMMENDATIONS UNTIL LATE THIS WEEK
c0nc0215 BUT IT'S ALREADY CLEAR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INCREASED ITS EMPHASIS ON EDUCATION
c0nc0216 THE EXPECTED FOURTH QUARTER RESULT WOULD GIVE THE COMPANY PROFIT OF TEN TO TWELVE CENTS A SHARE FOR ALL OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
c0nc0217 IT POSTED PROFIT OF TWENTY SEVEN CENTS A SHARE FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX INCLUDING ABOUT FOURTEEN CENTS A SHARE FROM AN ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT
c0nc0218 THE COMPANY DIDN'T MAKE ESTIMATES FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN NET INCOME
c0nc0219 ADVANCING ISSUES AND DECLINERS WERE NECK AND NECK YESTERDAY BUT THE HEAVIEST TRADING WAS AMONG THE ISSUES WITH RISING PRICES
c0nc021a SOME FIFTY POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS AT ADVANCING PRICES COMPARED WITH THIRTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION THAT TRADED AT LOWER PRICES
c0nc021b IN ALL A MODERATE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION SHARES TRADED ON NASDAQ YESTERDAY
c0nc021c ON FRIDAY SHEARSON LEHMAN BROTHERS INCORPORATED SAID IT IS CEASING PROGRAM TRADING FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT
c0nc021d WE DON'T WANT TO BE PART OF THE PROBLEM SAID JEFFREY LANE PRESIDENT OF SHEARSON
c0nc021e MR. LANE SAID HE WOULD RATHER SEE WALL STREET MODIFY ITS BEHAVIOR THAN HAVE WASHINGTON REGULATORS CLAMP DOWN
c0nc021g MOBIL BASED IN NEW YORK SAID ITS FOURTH QUARTER NET INCOME JUMPED NINETY TWO PERCENT
c0nc021h THE LATEST QUARTER INCLUDED A ONE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLAR WRITE DOWN OF FOREIGN INVENTORIES
c0nc021i REVENUE ROSE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TO FIFTEEN POINT SIX SIX BILLION DOLLARS FROM TWELVE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
c0nc021j CAMPEAU BOOSTED ITS HOSTILE OFFER FOR FEDERATED DEPARTMENT STORES TO FIVE POINT FOUR SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS AMID SIGNS OF A POSSIBLE BIDDING WAR FOR THE RETAILER
c0nc021k AT LEAST TWO MAJOR GROUPS ARE WEIGHING BIDS SOURCES SAID INCLUDING A GROUP LED BY KOHLBERG KRAVIS
c0nc021l OTHER POTENTIAL SUITORS ARE SAID TO BE DILLARD DEPARTMENT STORES AND DEVELOPERS ALFRED TAUBMAN AND MELVIN SIMON
c0nc021m SCIENTIFIC STUDIES HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE DEVICE CAUSED INFECTIONS THAT LED TO SEVERE COMPLICATIONS
c0nc021n ROBINS STILL CONTENDS OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INJURIES
c0nc021p DIRECTORS BOOSTED THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND SEVENTEEN PERCENT TO THIRTY FIVE CENTS A SHARE FROM THIRTY CENTS PAYABLE APRIL FIRST TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD MARCH EIGHTEENTH
c0nc021q THE TWO FOR ONE STOCK SPLIT IS PAYABLE MAY SECOND TO RECORD APRIL EIGHTH
c0nc021r THE COMPANY SAID IT INTENDS TO PAY SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE CENTS QUARTERLY EFFECTIVE WITH THE JULY FIRST PAYMENT
c0nc021s THAT GROWTH CAME IN RESPONSE TO A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES DURING THE SECOND HALF WHICH PROMPTED A FLOOD OF MORTGAGE APPLICATIONS
c0nc021t IT ALSO REFLECTED GOVERNMENT MEASURES TO STIMULATE DOMESTIC SPENDING
c0nc021u THE HOUSING BOOM IN TURN TRIGGERED HEAVY CONSUMER SPENDING ON HOUSEHOLD GOODS WHICH AIDED THE STRONG SECOND HALF ECONOMIC EXPANSION
c0nc021v INFLATION ADJUSTED GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT GREW TWO PERCENT IN THE THIRD QUARTER FROM THE PRIOR THREE MONTHS AND ONE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER
c0nc021w TURKEY WAS ON THE MOVE
c0nc021x IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR FEWER THAN HALF OF TURKEY'S VILLAGES HAD ELECTRICITY OR PHONES BY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN ONLY A FEW WERE WITHOUT
c0nc021y A HUGE CAMPAIGN BEGAN TO BUILD HIGHWAYS ROADS AND MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE DAMS
c0nc021z AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED WARNER AND LORIMAR AGREED IN MAY TO MERGE IN A STOCK SWAP VALUED AT ABOUT SIX HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS
c0nc0220 CHRIS CRAFT INDUSTRIES INCORPORATED WARNER'S LARGEST SHAREHOLDER HAS FILED SUIT TO DELAY THE MERGER CHARGING THAT IT VIOLATES CHRIS CRAFT'S SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT WITH WARNER
c0nc0221 NEVERTHELESS WARNER HAS SAID IT PLANS TO PROCEED WITH THE MERGER ANYWAY
c0nc0222 OTHER E. C. STATES ALSO HAVE RESERVATIONS THOUGH THEY DON'T FEEL AS STRONGLY ABOUT THEM AS DOES BRITAIN
c0nc0223 DENMARK FOR EXAMPLE WORRIES THAT IT MIGHT HAVE TO TIGHTEN CONTROLS ON ITS NON E. C. NORDIC NEIGHBORS
c0nc0224 IRELAND WANTS TO ENSURE THAT FREER BORDERS GO HAND IN HAND WITH CLOSER SECURITY COOPERATION AMONG E. C. NATIONS
c0nc0225 DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY THE ARMY PLAYS AN INCALCULABLE ROLE IN KEEPING PAKISTAN'S DISTORTED ECONOMY PERKING
c0nc0226 MR. JONES THE AUTHOR NOTES THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PAKISTANI HOUSEHOLDS FOUR PERCENT OF THE ECONOMICALLY ACTIVE ONES HAVE SENT YOUNG MEN INTO THE ARMY
c0nc0227 ADD IN THE HOUSEHOLDS INVOLVED IN SERVICES FOR THE MILITARY AND NEARLY TEN PERCENT OF THE NATION'S HOUSEHOLDS ARE INVOLVED
c0nc0228 NOT TO WORRY IT ADDS BECAUSE MAJOR CARRIERS BY CONTROLLING ROUTES AND MAJOR HUBS AREN'T AS VULNERABLE AS PREVIOUSLY TO COMPETITION
c0nc0229 THEY ALSO HAVE HIDDEN SALABLE ASSETS SUCH AS AIRPORT GATES LANDING SLOTS ROUTES AND PLANES
c0nc022a THEY MANAGE FARE STRUCTURES MORE EFFICIENTLY
c0nc022b AND THEY BENEFIT FROM HIGH OPERATING LEVERAGE
c0nc022c FOR EXAMPLE SALOMON SAYS A HALF PENNY INCREASE IN YIELD PER REVENUE PASSENGER MILE WOULD BOOST UNITED'S OPERATING INCOME BY THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS
c0nc022d BUT RUTH HANDLER HADN'T LOST HER CREATIVE TOUCH
c0nc022e AFTER UNDERGOING A MASTECTOMY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SHE FOUND THAT NO ONE WAS PRODUCING SUITABLE PROSTHESES
c0nc022f SO SHE DESIGNED HER OWN CALLED NEARLY ME AND THUS BEGAN ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS
c0oc0201 MR. KATO TAKES ADVANTAGE OF HIS COMPANY'S SHARE PURCHASE PLAN
c0oc0202 MITSUBISHI SUBSIDIZES ITS EMPLOYEES WHO BUY THE COMPANY'S SHARES BY PAYING TEN PERCENT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE
c0oc0203 HE FIGURES THAT HE GETS A MUCH BETTER RETURN THAT WAY THAN BY PUTTING MONEY IN THE BANK
c0oc0204 A TILT TOWARD TURKEY MAY VERY WELL BE WARRANTED BUT THE U. S. AND CONSERVATIVES IN PARTICULAR SHOULD NOT BE TEMPTED TO VENTURE TOO FAR
c0oc0205 MR. PAPANDREOU IS DEEP IN ECONOMIC MUSH AND AN EXCESSIVE SHOW OF SUPPORT NOW FOR TURKEY WOULD ONLY PROVIDE HIM WITH A FRESH OPPORTUNITY TO RALLY HIS FORCES
c0oc0206 THE SOCIALIST STORM APPEARS TO BE RECEDING IN ATHENS AND PRESIDENT REAGAN SHOULD CONTINUE TO RIDE IT OUT
c0oc0207 RAYTHEON DENIED THAT IT'S FREELY GIVING AWAY JOBS
c0oc0208 WE AREN'T CRAZY ABOUT OFFSETS BUT WE'D ENTER INTO THEM AS A COMPROMISE BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT IF IT'S THE BEST THAT'S AVAILABLE SAID RAYTHEON SPOKESMAN LAWRENCE MCCRACKEN
c0oc0209 HE ADDED THAT THERE WERE ALSO SOME POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS BEHIND THE DECISION TO SHARE THE PATRIOT BUSINESS WITH THE THREE U. S. ALLIES
c0oc020a SEPARATELY HEALTHCARE SAID IT INTENDS TO BUY BACK AS MUCH AS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF ITS CLASS A COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME ON THE OPEN MARKET
c0oc020b HEALTHCARE CURRENTLY HAS FOUR MILLION FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY CLASS A SHARES OUTSTANDING
c0oc020c IN COMPOSITE TRADING ON THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE YESTERDAY HEALTHCARE CLOSED AT NINE DOLLARS A SHARE DOWN TWELVE POINT FIVE CENTS
c0oc020d THEY HAVE PUT IN A LOT OF MONEY BUT IS THAT ENOUGH
c0oc020e NOBODY KNOWS SAID MR. BRAY
c0oc020f IN OCTOBER WE THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH BUT BETWEEN OCTOBER AND NOW IT'S PROVEN TO BE NOT ENOUGH
c0oc020g WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH IT WILL BE
c0oc020h MR. CAYNE DECLINED TO SAY WHICH FUNDS HIS FIRM SELLS OR HOW MUCH BUSINESS THEY REPRESENT
c0oc020i BUT CRITERION GROUP A HOUSTON BASED LOAD FUND GROUP ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS A MAJOR SUPPLIER TO BEAR STEARNS
c0oc020j BROKERAGE FIRMS GENERALLY SELL LOAD FUNDS BOTH THEIR OWN AND OTHERS WHICH CARRY A SALES CHARGE THAT PAYS THE BROKER'S COMMISSION
c0oc020k J. W. T. HADN'T YET RESPONDED TO W. P. P.'S WEDNESDAY BID OF FORTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE OR ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS
c0oc020l ON FRIDAY W. P. P. LAUNCHED A HOSTILE FORTY FIVE DOLLAR A SHARE TENDER OFFER FOR J. W. T.'S APPROXIMATELY TEN MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
c0oc020m THAT HOSTILE OFFER FORMALLY REMAINED IN EFFECT DESPITE W. P. P.'S LATEST MOVE
c0oc020n MANGA FITS NICELY INTO A LIFE STYLE THAT PROVIDES LITTLE TIME OR OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY LIVE ONE'S FANTASIES
c0oc020o FOR EXAMPLE STUDENTS WHOSE DAYS ACTUALLY ARE SPENT STUDYING BECOME COMIC BOOK SECRET AGENTS AND SOLDIERS
c0oc020p AND A FREQUENT MANGA THEME IS A BOY'S LOVE AFFAIR WITH HIS BUXOM TEACHER
c0oc020q BUT FIRST CITY WOUND UP MAKING LOANS TO SOME OF THE MOST TROUBLED ENERGY CONCERNS IN TEXAS
c0oc020r IT CONCENTRATED MORE THAN A THIRD OF ITS ENERGY LENDING IN THE ROLLERCOASTER FORTUNES OF SERVICE AND DRILLING COMPANIES
c0oc020s WHEN THE ENERGY INDUSTRY WAS GROWING THE LOANS WERE HIGHLY PROFITABLE OFTEN YIELDING TWO OR THREE POINTS OVER THE PRIME RATE
c0oc020t BUT WHEN OIL PRICES FELL IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO AND EXPLORATION SLOWED THESE COMPANIES SOME OF THEM YOUNG AND HIGHLY LEVERAGED QUICKLY RAN INTO PROBLEMS
c0oc020u ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THEY HADN'T EXPECTED LOWER OPERATING PROFITS FOR THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRIES GROUP AND FOR THE BROADCASTING SEGMENT
c0oc020v WESTINGHOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD ANALYSTS THAT OPERATING PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIES GROUP FELL FIFTEEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT HURT IN PART BY WEAK RESULTS IN CANADIAN OPERATIONS
c0oc020w A SHARP DROP IN OPERATING PROFIT FROM THE BROADCASTING GROUP'S PRODUCTION COMPANY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS OVERALL FOR THAT SEGMENT
c0oc020x IN DECEMBER AUTO LOANS INCREASED BY TWO POINT FIVE TWO BILLION DOLLARS OR AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF ELEVEN POINT SEVEN PERCENT
c0oc020y CREDIT CARD BORROWING SOARED BY TWO POINT THREE TWO BILLION DOLLARS OR AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF NINETEEN POINT FOUR PERCENT
c0oc020z A FED ECONOMIST SUGGESTED THIS LARGE INCREASE MAY REFLECT SLOWER GROWTH EARLIER IN THE YEAR AS CONSUMERS USED HOME EQUITY LOANS TO PAY OFF CREDIT CARD BALANCES
c0oc0210 ALL THE INCREASES ARE SEASONALLY ADJUSTED
c0oc0211 BUT HE IS BULLISH ON THE ECONOMY
c0oc0212 REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE SEE IN THE MARKET THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE SEEMS MUCH STRONGER THAN THE MARKET HE SAID
c0oc0213 WHEN I LEAVE THE OFFICE AND GET HOME I'M NOT AS CONCERNED WHEN I TALK TO THE NEIGHBORS
c0oc0214 WHILE CHRONICLING THE DOINGS OF THE HIGHFALUTIN MAY SEEM LIGHT STUFF TO SOME MR. REVSON SAYS HIS OWN APPROACH TO THE SUBJECT MATTER ISN'T
c0oc0215 IT ISN'T JUST THROWING TOGETHER A STRING OF NAMES AND SAYING THEY SIPPED CHAMPAGNE ATE CAVIAR AND WORE BILL BLASS THE COLUMNIST SAYS
c0oc0216 FACTS ARE IMPORTANT
c0oc0217 IF YOU SAY SOMEONE IS WEARING A RED TIE THEN HE SHOULD BE WEARING A RED TIE
c0oc0218 NET FOR THE PERIOD WAS AIDED BY THE DECLINE IN THE VALUE OF THE DOLLAR MR. EXLEY SAID
c0oc021a HE SAID THE COMPANY WILL ALSO HAVE AN INCREASE IN R. AND D. SPENDING FOR THE FULL YEAR BUT LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR PERCENT
c0oc021b BUT THE STRONG RESULTS AREN'T EXPECTED ACROSS THE INDUSTRY SAID HELANE BECKER AIRLINE ANALYST AT SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON INCORPORATED
c0oc021c IT'S GOING TO BE UNIQUE TO AMERICAN AND DELTA AIR LINES SHE SAID
c0oc021d BOTH CARRIERS BENEFITED TO SOME EXTENT FROM LABOR AND REGULATORY TROUBLES AT TEXAS AIR CORPORATION'S EASTERN AIRLINES SHE SAID
c0oc021e DELTA COMPETES WITH EASTERN IN TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED CITY PAIR MARKETS AND AMERICAN IN TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED
c0oc021f DELTA IS EXPECTED TO REPORT ITS RESULTS NEXT WEEK
c0oc021g ECONOMISTS SAID THE LOSSES SUGGEST THRIFTS WERE STILL TAKING LARGE WRITE DOWNS OF SOUTHWESTERN REAL ESTATE
c0oc021h MR. BARTH WHO HAS BEEN EXPECTING S. AND L. WRITE OFFS TO DECLINE CONCEDED HE HAD HOPED TO SEE LESS CAPITAL EROSION IN THE FIRST QUARTER
c0oc021i MR. OBRINSKY SAID TEXAS REAL ESTATE IS TAKING LONGER TO RECOVER THAN MANY HAD HOPED AND OTHERS HAD EXPECTED
c0oc021j SHARON ZIEMIAN ASSISTANT VICE PRESIDENT PRECIOUS METALS AT CITICORP'S CITIBANK N. A. NEW YORK OBSERVED THAT YESTERDAY'S MARKET REFLECTED CONFUSION
c0oc021k WHILE INFLATION FEARS ABOUND INFLATION ITSELF IS HARD TO ACTUALLY PIN DOWN SHE SAID
c0oc021l THIS CREATES THE WORRY THAT IF INTEREST RATES ARE RAISED IN ORDER TO COMBAT INFLATION THE FRAGILITY OF THE ECONOMY COULD BRING ABOUT A RECESSION
c0oc021m BUT IT WAS BECOMING APPARENT TO EVERYONE THAT THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT RECESSION WAS NOT TO BE
c0oc021n THE FED FIRST PULLED OUT SOME OF THE BASE THAT IT HAD PUMPED IN DURING JANUARY BUT THEN IT WAS OFF TO THE RACES AGAIN
c0oc021o NOW THERE IS A WIDESPREAD FEAR THAT WE MAY BE HEADING INTO AN INFLATIONARY BOOM AND MR. GREENSPAN SAYS THE FED IS TIGHTENING UP
c0oc021p IT'S TRUE THAT THE AGENCY HAS PERMITTED A RISE IN THE FED FUNDS RATE THE FEE CHARGED ON RESERVES BANKS LEND TO ONE ANOTHER
c0oc021q BUT SO FAR THERE IS NO SIGN THAT IT IS SLOWING THE GROWTH OF MONEY
c0oc021r THE DECISION TO INTERRUPT THE OLYMPIC COVERAGE COULD MEAN A POTENTIAL ADVERTISING REVENUE LOSS OF EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS ACCORDING TO MICHAEL GARTNER PRESIDENT OF N. B. C. NEWS
c0oc021s THE DEBATES WOULDN'T BE INTERRUPTED BY ADS
c0oc021t AFTER SOME SECOND GUESSING ON THEIR EARLIER DECISION TO SKIP THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE MR. GARTNER SAID NETWORK OFFICIALS CHANGED THEIR MINDS YESTERDAY
c0oc021u EIGHT MILLION BUCKS ISN'T SOMETHING YOU WANT TO KISS AWAY BUT YOU SWALLOW HARD AND DO WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT MR. GARTNER SAID
c0oc021v CHEMICAL'S TEXAS COMMERCE BANCSHARES INCORPORATED UNIT REPORTED PROFIT OF SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS
c0oc021w THAT FIGURE INCLUDES A THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLAR GAIN FROM INTERCOMPANY INCOME TAX BENEFITS UNDER THE CORPORATION'S TAX SHARING AGREEMENT
c0oc021x IN THE YEAR AGO QUARTER TEXAS COMMERCE HAD A LOSS OF THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH INCLUDED A SPECIAL CHARGE FROM THE RESTRUCTURING
c0oc021y CHEMICAL ACQUIRED TEXAS COMMERCE IN MAY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
c0oc021z I DON'T KNOW IF THE PARENTS UNDERSTAND HOW SUBTLE THIS NEW AGE MOVEMENT REALLY IS SHE SAYS
c0oc0220 THEY DRAW THE KIDS IN WITH FAIRY TALES AND SORCERY
c0oc0221 THEIR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO DO AWAY WITH ANYBODY WHO BELIEVES THERE'S SUCH A THING AS EVIL
c0oc0222 THIS YEAR THE SOVIETS HAVE MOVED COMMERCIAL SALES TO THE FRONT BURNER
c0oc0223 THE EXPORT ARM OF THE SOVIET MINISTRY OF AVIATION INDUSTRY HOPES TO DOUBLE ITS REVENUE BY THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES
c0oc0224 BUT SUCH A SHIFT WOULD BRING MAJOR UPHEAVALS TO THE SOVIET SYSTEM
c0oc0225 ORDERS FOR MILITARY AIRCRAFT HAVE FALLEN TWENTY PERCENT IN THE PAST TWO YEARS ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES
c0oc0226 AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES PRESTIGIOUS MILITARY DESIGN BUREAUS IN THE SOVIET UNION ARE DEVOTING SUBSTANTIAL MANPOWER TO CIVILIAN PROJECTS
c0oc0227 IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE POLITICAL SETTLEMENT ENVISAGED BY THE NON COMMUNISTS SEEMED PLAUSIBLE
c0oc0228 SOVIET LEADER MIKHAIL GORBACHEV WAS A MAJOR REASON
c0oc0229 MR. GORBACHEV SAW THE EXPANSIONIST AMBITIONS OF HIS PREDECESSORS STYMIED BY THE RESOLUTE CONTAINMENT POLICY OF BOTH CHINA AND THE PRO WESTERN ASEAN POWERS

c0sc021g WHOEVER HE IS HE WILL HAVE HIS HANDS FULL OF PROBLEMS FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC
c0sc021h THE GOVERNMENT'S FINANCES CRY OUT FOR A STRONG PRESIDENT TO GRAPPLE WITH THEM AND TO PERSUADE A CHAOTIC CONGRESS TO ACCEPT HIS PROGRAM

c0sc021n THEY HAVE SOUGHT THE OPINIONS OF ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS BUT THEY SAY THEY WILL FIGHT FOR A SUBSTANTIVE RATHER THAN SYMBOLIC PIECE OF LEGISLATION
c0sc021o THAT GROWTH CAME IN RESPONSE TO A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES DURING THE SECOND HALF WHICH PROMPTED A FLOOD OF MORTGAGE APPLICATIONS
c0sc021p IT ALSO REFLECTED GOVERNMENT MEASURES TO STIMULATE DOMESTIC SPENDING
c0sc021q THE HOUSING BOOM IN TURN TRIGGERED HEAVY CONSUMER SPENDING ON HOUSEHOLD GOODS WHICH AIDED THE STRONG SECOND HALF ECONOMIC EXPANSION
c0sc021r INFLATION ADJUSTED GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT GREW TWO PERCENT IN THE THIRD QUARTER FROM THE PRIOR THREE MONTHS AND ONE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

c0sc021w COMMISSION CHAIRMAN DENNIS PATRICK HOWEVER SAID HE THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE ECONOMIC INCENTIVES TO KEEP INDEPENDENT STATIONS ON CABLE SYSTEMS AS LONG AS THEY WERE POPULAR
c0sc021x MR. PATRICK ALSO SAID THAT ONE ORIGINAL CONCERN THAT NETWORK OWNERSHIP MIGHT IMPEDE THE GROWTH OF CABLE AS A COMPETITOR OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE

c0sc021z IN JULY MULTIFAMILY UNIT STARTS ROSE EIGHTEEN POINT SEVEN PERCENT
c0sc0221 MULTIFAMILY HOUSING STARTS FELL NINE POINT FIVE PERCENT IN JUNE AND TWENTY TWO PERCENT IN MAY

c0sc022h MY DOG'S JUST EIGHT WEEKS OLD HE EXPLAINED
c0sc022i INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SMALL MEDICAL BILLS IS ESPECIALLY WASTEFUL
c0sc022j USUALLY IT WILL COST AN INSURER MORE THAN FIFTY DOLLARS TO MONITOR EFFECTIVELY A FIFTY DOLLAR PHYSICIAN BILL THEREBY DOUBLING THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE
c0sc022k BUT FAILURE TO MONITOR ENCOURAGES PATIENTS AND DOCTORS TO MAKE WASTEFUL DECISIONS WITHOUT FEAR OF THIRD PARTY SCRUTINY
c0tc0201 BROKERAGE STOCKS HAVE BEEN WILTING FOR MONTHS
c0tc0202 SALOMON'S STOCK DIVED ELEVEN PERCENT ON HUGE VOLUME MONDAY CASTING A TEMPORARY PALL OVER THE WHOLE GROUP

c0tc0206 THE REFUND WILL SHOW UP AS A CREDIT IN FEBRUARY ELECTRIC BILLS THE UNIT SAID
c0tc0207 THE COMPANIES' SHARPLY IMPROVED RESULTS PROVIDED MORE EVIDENCE OF A REBOUND IN BOTH THE CHIP AND PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRIES
c0tc0208 THE RESULTS FOLLOW A REPORT LAST WEEK FROM THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION THAT THE BELEAGUERED CHIP INDUSTRY IS EXPERIENCING AN UPTURN
c0tc0209 IN MARCH THE INDUSTRY'S LEADING INDICATOR REACHED THE HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
c0tc020a U. S. AIR OPERATES PRIMARILY IN THE EAST AND MIDWEST

c0tc020f INSTEAD HE SAYS THEY'RE EATING ONLY FOR SENSATION
c0tc020g MR. ROBINSON FIFTY EIGHT HAS BEEN CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRESIDENT AND WILL RETAIN THE POSITION OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE
c0tc020h THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY SAID JOHN C. HAIGH FORMERLY EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT SUCCEEDS MR. ROBINSON AS PRESIDENT

c0tc020j SENATOR LEAHY RETREATED AND JUDGE SENTELLE WAS UNANIMOUSLY CONFIRMED BY THE COMMITTEE ON APRIL TWENTY NINTH
c0tc020k BUT WITH SOME DEMOCRATS NO ACTION IS TOO SMALL IN THE EFFORT TO NEGATE A CONSERVATIVE PRESIDENCY
c0tc020m HE EXERCISED HIS RIGHT TO BLOCK A FLOOR VOTE ON JUDGE SENTELLE UNTIL THE SENATOR QUERIED THE A. B. A. REGARDING THE PROPRIETY OF THE JUDGE'S MEMBERSHIP IN THE MASONS
c0tc020n BUT SIX YEARS OF HUGE TRADE DEFICITS AND BUDGET DEFICITS HAVE CHANGED ALL THAT
c0tc020o BY THE END OF LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT SAYS FOREIGNERS HELD TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS MORE IN U. S. ASSETS THAN AMERICANS HELD OVERSEAS
c0tc020p SOME ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS DOUBT THE ACCURACY OF THOSE NUMBERS BUT NO ONE QUESTIONS THE TREND

c0tc020s A DREXEL SPOKESMAN SAID HE EXPECTS THE FINANCING TO COME THROUGH A COMBINATION OF BANK LOANS AND HIGH YIELD BONDS
c0tc020t DREXEL FINANCED THE KOHLBERG KRAVIS BUY OUT OF BEATRICE LAST YEAR
c0tc020u CRITICS OF THE INDEXING CHARGE THAT THE APPROACH LACKS IMAGINATION AND AMOUNTS TO SETTLING FOR MEDIOCRITY

c0tc020y MR. HARRISON SAID THE COMPANY DOESN'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO LEAP THE POLITICAL HURDLES THAT ARE BLOCKING SEABROOK
c0tc020z BUT THE FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING IS INTENDED TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING WITHOUT ADDITIONAL BORROWING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETEEN NINETY ONE HE SAID
c0tc0210 CERTAINLY FOREIGN COMPETITION AND A CHANGING WORLD ECONOMY HAVE EXACTED A HEAVY TOLL ON OUR NATION'S MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
c0tc0211 HOWEVER MANY OF THESE INDUSTRIES HAVE SURVIVED AND ARE NOW AS TOUGH AND LEAN AS THEY'VE EVER BEEN
c0tc0212 THE MANAGERS OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE LEARNED THROUGH HARD EXPERIENCE ABOUT EXACTLY WHICH INVESTMENTS PAY OFF
c0tc0213 ALSO BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE CASH GUZZLERS CONSTANTLY NEEDING MONEY FOR CLINICAL TRIALS AND MANUFACTURING FACILITIES
c0tc0214 THE CRITICAL FACTOR FOR MOST COMPANIES ISN'T HOW MUCH CASH THEY HAVE BUT HOW IT'S BEING SPENT MR. MACCALLUM SAYS
c0tc0215 SOME COMPANIES THAT ARE SELLING AT CLOSE TO THEIR PERSHARE CASH VALUES ARE CORRECTLY BEING PERCEIVED IN A SKEPTICAL LIGHT HE CONTENDS
c0tc0216 <NOISE> KIM YOUNG SAM WAS FORMALLY NOMINATED FOR PRESIDENT BY SOUTH KOREA'S MAIN OPPOSITION PARTY

c0tc021a THE WINNER IN THE GENERAL ELECTION USED SOME CREATIVE METHODS TOO
c0tc021b RONALD REAGAN'S CAMPAIGN REGISTERED VOTERS FOR THE GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN USING TWO MILLION DOLLARS CHARGED TO HIS UNCONTESTED RENOMINATION
c0tc021c THE STAFF OF THE ELECTION COMMISSION CHALLENGED THAT AND RECOMMENDED THAT SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FEDERAL SUBSIDIES BE REPAID TO THE TREASURY
c0tc021d BUT THE AUDITORS WERE OVERRULED BY A FOUR TO ONE VOTE OF THE COMMISSION IN WHICH ALL REPUBLICAN MEMBERS SIDED WITH THE PRESIDENT
c0tc021e MR. REICHLER RECENTLY STUNNED SOME LIBERALS WHEN HE AGREED TO REPRESENT THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT IN ITS QUEST TO WIN U. S. AID FOR ITS POLICE FORCE AND MILITARY
c0tc021f SOME HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS STRONGLY OPPOSED THE REQUEST CITING GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES' HISTORY OF ABUSES
c0tc021g MR. REICHLER LAUNCHED A LOBBYING BLITZ AMONG U. S. LIBERALS ARGUING THAT THE AID WOULD HELP STEM VIOLATIONS
c0tc021h THE POLICE GOT TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR TRAINING AND GUATEMALA GOT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN MILITARY ASSISTANCE
c0tc021i SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FRANK CARLUCCI HAS SAID I THINK A SMALLER MORE EFFECTIVE FORCE IS A MUCH BETTER DETERRENT THAN A LARGE LESS EFFECTIVE FORCE
c0tc021j PROBABLY TRUE
c0tc021k BUT THE BUDGET RULES OUT THE BEST OPTION WHICH IS A LARGE MORE EFFECTIVE FORCE
c0tc021l IN THE OLD DAYS T. V. WAS CALLED ELECTRONIC VAUDEVILLE
c0tc021m BACK THEN EVERYONE LOVED THE RAZZMATAZZ OF THE VARIETY SHOW A LITTLE SINGING A LITTLE DANCING A LITTLE COMEDY
c0tc021n BUT TODAY NO ONE WANTS VARIETY ANYMORE
c0tc021o ACCORDING TO T. V. EXECUTIVE WISDOM THE OLD SONG AND DANCE IS DEAD OR AT LEAST CRIPPLED
c0tc021p DUKAKIS DEFEATED JACKSON BY A THREE TO TWO MARGIN IN SATURDAY'S ARIZONA PRESIDENTIAL CAUCUSES

c0tc021r JACKSON RECEIVED FOURTEEN DELEGATES AND GORE GOT NONE
c0tc021s ALL THREE CANDIDATES CONTINUED CAMPAIGNING IN NEW YORK FOR TOMORROW'S PRIMARY ELECTION
c0tc021t BUT NETWORK OFFICIALS WILL SPEND MONTHS DEBATING C. B. S.'S WISDOM
c0tc021u IT'S TIME TO BE AGGRESSIVE SAID MR. PILSON TESTILY TAKING ON REPORTERS AT YESTERDAY'S PRESS CONFERENCE
c0tc021v I'M UP HERE STATING C. B. S. HAS ACQUIRED THE RIGHTS AND N. B. C. HASN'T
c0tc021w AT N. B. C. MR. WATSON WAS PHILOSOPHIC IF PRAGMATIC YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE A WINNER HE SAID
c0tc021x BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE AT THE SAME TIME
c0tc021y THE SALE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS NOT WIDELY EXPECTED
c0tc021z BUT DESPITE THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE THE NEWS HAD LITTLE NET EFFECT ON THE SECONDARY MARKET FOR NEW YORK BONDS
c0tc0220 THERE ISN'T ENOUGH SUPPLY FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE SIZABLE OFFERING TO HAVE MUCH IMPACT EXPLAINED ONE TRADER
c0tc0221 MR. DEMME THINKS A MAN WHO PLAYS SPOONS ON THE STREET IS FUNNY
c0tc0222 HE CASTS JOSEPH L. MR.

c0tc022e <NOISE> WHETHER THE EAST GERMAN GOVERNMENT CAN EXTRICATE ITSELF FROM ITS CURRENT CRISIS IS A QUESTION THAT CONFOUNDS WESTERN ANALYSTS
c0tc022f HOWEVER MOST AGREE THAT EAST GERMANY IS LURCHING TOWARD CRISIS
c0tc022g <NOISE> ABOVE ALL IT IS A CRISIS THAT THE NATION'S AGING LEADERS SEEM UTTERLY CONFUSED BY
c0tc022h WITH THE REST OF THE EAST BLOC SWEPT UP IN A TIDE OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CHANGE EAST BERLIN HAS STEADFASTLY STUCK TO ITS OLD WAYS
c0tc022i YET THE GOVERNMENT LED BY SEVENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD ERICH HONECKER APPEARS ALMOST INCAPABLE OF GOVERNING AT A TIME THAT DEMANDS NEW IDEAS
c0uc0202 BY VIRTUE OF THEIR SIZE ALONE THEY WILL BE DOMINANT IN THE STATE MR. GRANT ADDED
c0uc0203 EXACTLY WHAT IMPACT THAT COMPETITION WILL HAVE IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS NOW HE SAID
c0uc0204 INDEED ANY CRIMINAL ACTIVITY WOULD NORMALLY BE GROUNDS FOR SUSPENDING A STUDENT HARVARD OFFICIALS SAY
c0uc0205 THE FACT IS INSIDER TRADING IS BUSINESS RELATED AND WE'RE A BUSINESS SCHOOL SAYS MR. LYNCH
c0uc0206 BUT I THINK OUR POSTURE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME IF IT WERE ANY KIND OF BEHAVIOR THAT WAS OF A CRIMINAL NATURE
c0uc0207 AS A LONGTIME MEMBER OF THE ANAHEIM CALIFORNIA
c0uc0208 REDEVELOPMENT COMMISSION THE RETIRED FOOD COMPANY EXECUTIVE TOOK PRIDE IN HELPING HIS CITY GROW
c0uc0209 BUT HE ALSO LOVED THE FREE SILVER PASS THAT DISNEYLAND GAVE HIM EVERY YEAR AS ONE OF NEARLY ONE THOUSAND LOCAL NOTABLES SO HONORED
c0uc020b BUT OTHER PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRANTS SEEK TO WOO LABOR WITH TOUGH TALK
c0uc020c BIDEN WOULD THREATEN TO LET THE DOLLAR SLIDE OR EVEN LINK TRADE TO THE PRESENCE OF U. S. TROOPS IN JAPAN AND GERMANY
c0uc020d THERE'S A CERTAIN AWAKENING AND STIRRING IN THE EUROPEAN MICROCHIP INDUSTRY SAID DOUGLAS DUNN MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE SEMICONDUCTOR DIVISION OF BRITAIN'S PLESSEY COMPANY

c0uc020j WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO DEFER MEDIUM AND LONG TERM FINANCING SAYS MR. BLAKELY
c0uc020k IN FACT WE JUST REVIEWED THIS SUBJECT AND DECIDED TO WAIT UNTIL LATER THIS YEAR
c0uc020l STILL HE ADDS I THINK WE'RE HEADED FOR HIGHER RATES IN THE LONG TERM HOWEVER
c0uc020m XOMA MOVED UP TWO AND ONE HALF TO TWENTY THREE AND ONE HALF IN OVER THE COUNTER TRADING
c0uc020o PFIZER ROSE THREE QUARTERS TO SEVENTY
c0uc020p MS. OATES DOESN'T SAY MUCH ABOUT PERSONAL POWER ABOUT BEING ABLE TO STAND UP TO OTHERS
c0uc020q BUT THE FEELING OF POWER AND CONFIDENCE IS WHAT WE LADY BOXERS AGREED WE LIKED MOST ABOUT OUR NEW SKILL
c0uc020r IT'S ALSO WHY WE ADVOCATE BOXING FOR ALL ESPECIALLY FOR LITTLE GIRLS WHO ARE STILL RAISED TO BELIEVE THEY DON'T HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE IN A MAN'S WORLD
c0uc020s L. T. V. HAS SAID REPEATEDLY SINCE ITS FILING THAT IT WOULD FIGHT ANY CREDITOR MOVE TO EITHER REORGANIZE THE UNIT SEPARATELY OR FORCE ITS SALE
c0uc020t CREDITORS ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE DISCUSSED THE IDEA ALMOST SINCE THE DAY OF L. T. V.'S FILING

c0uc020x AT THAT TIME THE PREY HIMSELF MAY ANSWER
c0uc020y WE ARE INTRODUCED TO A CAST OF CHARACTERS WE HEAR A FEW OF THEIR FAMOUS LINES BUT WE GET ONLY THE VAGUEST SENSE OF THEM AS PEOPLE
c0uc020z THIS IS PARTIALLY A TECHNICAL PROBLEM IN AN HOUR SHOW IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO OFFER TOO MANY INSIGHTS INTO SO MANY SEPARATE WRITERS
c0uc0210 BUT WHATEVER THE REASON YOU COME AWAY FEELING A LITTLE CHEATED
c0uc0211 ALONG WITH HIS PARTNER PHIL DILEO MR. KELLNER HAS BEEN REGARDED AS ONE OF WALL STREET'S BIGGEST AND BRIGHTEST MONEYMAKERS

c0uc0213 LAST YEAR THE FIRM IS SAID TO HAVE EARNED MORE THAN SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS
c0uc0215 IT IS AMONG MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED WORDS PHRASES AND SYMBOLS FOR WHICH THE ASSOCIATION HAS GAINED TRADEMARK PROTECTION IN CANADA
c0uc0216 A SPOKESMAN FOR THE U. S. OLYMPIC COMMITTEE SAID MOST SUCH WORDS AND SYMBOLS ARE SIMILARLY PROTECTED IN THE U. S.
c0uc0217 IDEALLY A CAMPAIGN'S FREE MEDIA AND PAID MEDIA MESH SEAMLESSLY ONE REINFORCING THE OTHER
c0uc0218 PRESIDENT REAGAN'S NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR RE ELECTION EFFORT MAY HAVE SET A NEW STANDARD IN THIS REGARD
c0uc0219 RALLIES WERE METICULOUSLY STAGED TO REINFORCE THE CAMPAIGN'S MESSAGE OF PATRIOTISM AND OPTIMISM
c0uc021a THE RESULT WAS NEWS FOOTAGE THAT LOOKED LIKE THE CAMPAIGN'S COMMERCIALS
c0uc021b THE COMPANY WOULD MAKE A TENDER OFFER FOR ITS PREFERRED SHARES AT TWENTY ONE DOLLARS AND FORTY CENTS A SHARE
c0uc021c MOST OF THE MORE THAN FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS REQUIRED TO RETIRE THE PREFERRED STOCK WOULD BE BORROWED MR. MOORE SAID
c0uc021d AT THE SAME TIME THE COMPANY WOULD RESTRUCTURE EXISTING BANK LOANS

c0uc021g N. E. C. ROSE TEN TO ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED TEN
c0uc021h SONY ROSE TWENTY TO FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY

c0uc021o MR. KIELLEY PLANS TO USE EXISTING TOWERS PERRIN OFFICES TO OPEN BRANCHES OF BOTH CRESAP AND A SMALLER TOWERS PERRIN INSURANCE UNIT
c0uc021p WE'LL USE THE BENEFITS BUSINESS AS A BEACHHEAD HE SAYS
c0uc021q OPENING A CRESAP OFFICE IN TOKYO WHERE TOWERS PERRIN ALREADY HAS A BENEFITS OFFICE WOULD BE OF HIGHEST PRIORITY
c0uc021r BUT THE EXPERIENCE SHOWED THERE WAS A MUCH BIGGER VIEWING AUDIENCE AND MARKET THAN HOME SHOPPING HAD REALIZED
c0uc021s BOTH M. C. I. AND HOME SHOPPING QUICKLY ADDED CAPACITY
c0uc021t BEFORE THE DELUGE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CALLS WAS CONSIDERED A HEAVY DAY

c0uc021z THE MACHINE ALSO CONVERTS HANDWRITING AT THE SLUGGISH PACE OF TWO SYMBOLS PER SECOND
c0uc0220 AND AT TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS TO THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS IT WILL COST MORE THAN MOST CONVENTIONAL PORTABLE P. C.S

c0uc022a BUT FREEDOM ISN'T AN ACCIDENT
c0uc022b IT IS THE RESULT OF PAINSTAKING WORK TO MAINTAIN THE STRUCTURE OF LIBERTY AGAINST INEVITABLE EROSION AT THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNMENT
c0uc022c I THOUGHT THAT MY WORK FOR THE A. C. L. U. WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF MAINTAINING FREEDOM FOR EVERYONE
c0uc022d I NOW CONFESS MY ERROR AND EMBRACE LEADER BUSH'S PERCEPTION THAT THE A. C. L. U. IS A POLITICALLY SUSPECT LIBERAL CONSPIRACY
c0uc022e HE WAS A DIGGER THEN BUT HE FOUND THIS DIAMOND LYING ON THE GROUND
c0uc022f HE FELL ON IT SPEECHLESS IN HIS EXCITEMENT CLUTCHING IT IN HIS FIST
c0uc022g HIS FELLOW DIGGERS AT FIRST FEARED MR. SCHALL HAD SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK
c0vc0201 THE DEPARTMENT ALSO SAID THAT PRODUCTIVITY FOR NONFINANCIAL COMPANIES INCREASED AT A ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT ANNUAL RATE IN THE THIRD QUARTER A PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE
c0vc0202 THE ESTIMATE IS BASED ON AN INCREASE IN OUTPUT OF ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT AND AN INCREASE IN HOURS WORKED OF ONE POINT ONE PERCENT
c0vc0203 THIS WAS THE FIRST QUARTER IN WHICH PRODUCTIVITY INCREASED IN THE NONFINANCIAL SECTOR SINCE THE THIRD QUARTER OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
c0vc0204 ANALYSTS SAID THE ECONOMY APPEARS EVEN WEAKER SO FAR IN THE FOURTH QUARTER
c0vc0205 THE ECONOMICS MINISTRY YESTERDAY SAID THE INFLOW OF ORDERS TO MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY FELL A PRELIMINARY TWO PERCENT IN OCTOBER FROM SEPTEMBER
c0vc0206 THAT FOLLOWED NEWS EARLIER IN THE WEEK THAT INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION WAS STAGNANT IN OCTOBER
c0vc0207 SO FAR ILLEGAL FOREIGN WORKERS AREN'T TAKEN AS A JOB THREAT BY JAPANESE WORKERS
c0vc0208 BUT JAPANESE UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS BECAUSE OF THE YEN'S STRENGTH POSING A KNOTTY PROBLEM FOR THE GOVERNMENT
c0vc0209 MANY JAPANESE COMPANIES IN SUCH INDUSTRIES AS STEEL AND SHIPBUILDING ARE CUTTING THEIR LABOR FORCES
c0vc020a THE U. S. WOULDN'T BE SORRY TO SEE THE SOVIET PEACE OFFENSIVE FALTER
c0vc020b SOME THINK THE RUSSIANS HOPE THEIR EFFORT WILL FOMENT DISCORD IN PAKISTAN WHERE OPPOSITION PARTIES MAY USE IT TO OPPOSE GOVERNMENT POLICY OF HARBORING AFGHAN GUERRILLAS

c0vc020k SAYS MR. KAY IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT IMPROVING U. S. COMPETITIVENESS ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS HAS TO BE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

c0vc020o THE PROBLEM IS SPECULATION BY TRADERS THAT VERGES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE
c0vc020p ETHICS CONSULTANTS ON THE OTHER HAND SHOULD BE CLINICIANS AND TEACH DECISION MAKING SKILLS TO PRACTICING PHYSICIANS WHEN DOING CASE CONSULTATION
c0vc020q COMPETENCY IN MEDICINE AND TRAINING IN ETHICS ARE REQUIRED TO SOLVE MORAL PROBLEMS IN PATIENT CARE
c0vc020r EVEN MORE IMPORTANT HOWEVER IS THE INDIVIDUAL CONSULTANT'S ABILITY TO TEACH PRACTITIONERS TO FORM THEIR OWN CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR SOLVING ETHICAL PROBLEMS
c0vc020s WHEN SEEKING TO MAKE THE FAIREST AND MOST ETHICAL DECISIONS LET'S GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT AT THE PATIENT'S BEDSIDE NOT IN A COMMITTEE ROOM
c0vc020t THE PROBLEM ACCORDING TO VENTURE CAPITALISTS WHO READ HUNDREDS OF BUSINESS PLANS EACH YEAR IS THAT MOST ENTREPRENEURS GET THEIR PRIORITIES REVERSED
c0vc020u IN THEIR RUSH TO GET THE NEW IDEA LAUNCHED THEY DON'T SPEND ENOUGH TIME PREPARING THEIR BUSINESS PLAN
c0vc020v THEN THEY EXPECT A POTENTIAL PARTNER OR LENDER TO SPEND THREE HOURS READING IT
c0vc020w IN ADDITION BY CONSENTING TO RORER'S BID ROBINS MAY HAVE PUT ITSELF UP FOR SALE
c0vc020x THE WHOLE THING COULD STILL DETERIORATE INTO AN AUCTION SAID A LAWYER WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE MANVILLE CORPORATION BANKRUPTCY LAW CASE
c0vc020y OTHER BIDDERS COULD COME IN
c0vc020z HE ALSO RELIED HEAVILY ON ADVERTISING RATHER THAN ON DIRECT MAILING WHICH IS BY FAR THE MOST COMMON WAY FOR NEWSLETTER PUBLISHERS TO SOLICIT SUBSCRIBERS
c0vc0210 THIS UNUSUAL STRATEGY EVOLVED FROM A SMALL AD PLACED IN A BUSINESS MAGAZINE
c0vc0211 THE NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR AD GENERATED ENOUGH SUBSCRIPTIONS TO PAY FOR ITSELF IN A WEEK SO MR. KOBREN BEGAN ADVERTISING IN OTHER PUBLICATIONS
c0vc0212 OF HIS COMPANY'S ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN OPERATING EXPENSES LAST YEAR FULLY HALF WENT FOR MARKETING
c0vc0213 THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATION OF AN AGREEMENT AND THE APPROVAL OF TRI STAR DIRECTORS SHAREHOLDERS AND COCA COLA DIRECTORS
c0vc0214 IT ALSO WOULD HAVE TO SATISFY VARIOUS REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
c0vc0215 COCA COLA SAID IT HOPES TO COMPLETE THE TRANSACTION BY THE END OF THIS YEAR
c0vc0216 BECAUSE OF COCA COLA'S SIZABLE STAKE IN TRI STAR THE MERGER IS EXPECTED TO BE CARRIED OUT
c0vc0217 THE ADDED INVESTMENT COMES AT A TIME OF CONTINUING RED INK AT THE TELEVISION VENTURE AND AMID WIDESPREAD SPECULATION THAT NEWS CORPORATION WAS PLANNING TO REDUCE ITS INVESTMENT
c0vc0218 IN THE YEAR ENDED JUNE THIRTIETH SATELLITE TELEVISION POSTED A PRETAX LOSS OF FIVE POINT SIX NINE MILLION POUNDS ON REVENUE OF EIGHT MILLION POUNDS THE SPOKESWOMAN SAID
c0vc0219 IT STILL IS POSSIBLE THAT NEWS INTERNATIONAL MAY CUT ITS STAKE SHE SAID
c0vc021a IT IS CONCEIVABLE AT SOME POINT THAT THE THING COULD BEGIN TO MUSHROOM HE SAID
c0vc021b IF THAT HAPPENS THEN WHAT HAS GOT TO BE DONE TO PRESERVE THE ECONOMY AND PREVENT IT FROM BREAKING APART IS DANGEROUSLY HIGH INTEREST RATES
c0vc021c IT WOULD CAUSE A TREMENDOUS CONTRACTION IN THE ECONOMY
c0vc021d THE PROGRAM APPLIES TO STOCK OF RECORD OCTOBER SECOND
c0vc021e THE ELIGIBLE SHAREHOLDERS MAY OWN FEWER THAN ONE HUNDRED SHARES IN ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANIES
c0vc021f MERRILL LYNCH SAID IT WILL RESELL THE SHARES ON THE OPEN MARKET
c0vc021g NONETHELESS THE TALKS WERE MARKED BY AN EASING OF TRADE TENSIONS IN CONTRAST WITH THE COURSE OF RELATIONS IN PREVIOUS YEARS
c0vc021h U. S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE CLAYTON YEUTTER SAID THE TWO SIDES WERE HANDLING TRADE RELATIONS AS WELL AS AT ANY OTHER TIME IN RECENT MEMORY
c0vc021i BUT HE WARNED OF ADDITIONAL CONFRONTATION IF NO PROGRESS WAS MADE ON FARM ISSUES THAT ARE ON THE FRONT BURNER
c0vc021j NOTHING HAS BEEN DECIDED
c0vc021k NOTHING HAS BEEN RULED OUT SENATOR BYRD SAID AFTER THE MEETING WITH LABOR
c0vc021l WE WILL CONTINUE TO MEET TO ACHIEVE THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE TRADE BILL TO SERVE THE WORKING MEN AND WOMEN AND INDUSTRIES OF THIS COUNTRY
c0vc021m GENLYTE DESIGNS AND MAKES LIGHTING FIXTURES AND ELECTRONIC LIGHTING CONTROLS
c0vc021n OTHER BAIRNCO UNITS MAKE ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS COMPOSITE MATERIALS AND ELECTROMAGNETIC SHIELDING SYSTEMS
c0vc021o IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN NEW YORKBASED BAIRNCO EARNED TWENTY EIGHT POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS OR TWO DOLLARS AND SIXTY EIGHT CENTS A SHARE
c0vc021p AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING OF HIGHER FARM PRICES
c0vc021q BUT HIGHER FARM PRICES WOULD ADD TO AN ALREADY STEEP INFLATION RATE
c0vc021r SO BEIJING OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY TALK OF TYING WAGES TO INFLATION AN IDEA REMINISCENT OF THE WAGE INDEXATION TRIED IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS
c0vc021s NOW HOWEVER IT APPEARS INCREASINGLY LIKELY THAT MR. MITTERRAND WILL DISSOLVE THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND CALL A NEW ELECTION
c0vc021t POLLS SHOW THAT THE SOCIALISTS HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF WINNING AN ABSOLUTE MAJORITY IF ELECTIONS WERE HELD NOW ENABLING MESSRS.
c0vc021u MITTERRAND AND ROCARD TO GOVERN WITHOUT RELYING ON THE CENTRISTS
c0vc021v A BIG PART OF THE REASON FOR WOOD'S SUCCESS IS THE NEW TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS FOR WOOD PANELS WITH A STEEL CORE
c0vc021w BESIDES NARROWING THE PRICE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WOOD AND METAL SYSTEMS THESE TECHNIQUES PROVIDED THE PRECISION NEEDED IN DESIGNING PANEL SYSTEMS THAT MUST FIT TOGETHER
c0vc021x ALMOST ALL THE MAJOR OFFICE FURNITURE MANUFACTURERS HAVE ACQUIRED THE ABILITY TO MAKE WOOD SYSTEMS IN RECENT YEARS
c0vc021y REGULATORS IN STATES THAT HAD ALLOWED TARGETED MAILINGS BEFORE THE COURT'S RULING SAY COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN RARE
c0vc021z FOR THE MOST PART LAWYERS HAVE BEHAVED IN AN ETHICAL RESPONSIBLE MANNER SAYS THOMAS JOHNSON CHAIRMAN OF THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION COMMISSION ON ADVERTISING
c0vc0220 MOST COMPLAINTS HE ADDS ARE MADE BY OTHER LAWYERS WHOSE CLIENTS HAVE RECEIVED LETTERS FROM OTHER ATTORNEYS
c0vc0221 THAT NEWS SENT THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE ON A GIDDY RISE OF MORE THAN FIFTY POINTS
c0vc0222 BUT INVESTORS MAY NEED TO BE SHOWN MORE
c0vc0223 FRIDAY'S VOLUME AFTER SUBTRACTING A BIG DIVIDEND CAPTURE TRADE WAS ONLY MODERATE AT AROUND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION SHARES
c0vc0224 <NOISE> SENATORIAL PRIVILEGE HAS SOLD MORE THAN SEVENTY THOUSAND COPIES DESPITE THIS MAJOR MEDIA NEGLECT OR PERHAPS BECAUSE OF IT
c0vc0225 MR. DAMORE HAS GONE HAWKING THE BOOK IN THAT PARALLEL UNIVERSE OF POPULIST MEDIA OUTLETS
c0vc0226 THE BOOK GOT ITS FIRST BIG PUSH FROM A SEGMENT ON A CURRENT AFFAIR THE FOX NETWORK'S TELEVISION TABLOID
c0vc0227 MR. DAMORE HAS DONE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED INTERVIEWS ON TALK RADIO STATIONS
c0vc0228 MAYTAG IS THE LEADING LAUNDRY APPLIANCE COMPANY IN THE U. S. SAID CHARLES RYAN AN ANALYST WITH MERRILL LYNCH RESEARCH
c0vc0229 HOOVER IS THE LEADING LAUNDRY COMPANY OUTSIDE THE U. S.
c0vc022a IT'S A GOOD FIT
c0vc022b NOT ALL BLACK COLLEGES ARE ON THE ROPES
c0vc022c IN FACT A NUMBER OF ELITE INSTITUTIONS ARE THRIVING IN PART BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL FUND RAISING EFFORTS
c0vc022d LAST WEEK FOR INSTANCE MR. COSBY AND HIS WIFE CAMILLE DONATED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SPELMAN COLLEGE A BLACK WOMEN'S COLLEGE IN ATLANTA
c0vc022e THE DOLLAR WAS CONFINED TO FAIRLY NARROW RANGES IN ASIAN AND EARLY EUROPEAN TRADING AS MARKET PARTICIPANTS CONCENTRATED ON MARK YEN TRADING
c0vc022f THE GERMAN CURRENCY TRADED IN A RANGE BETWEEN SEVENTY THREE POINT THREE OH YEN AND SEVENTY THREE POINT SIX FIVE YEN THROUGH MOST OF NEW YORK TRADING
c0vc022g AT THE NEW YORK FINISH THE MARK WAS UNCHANGED AT SEVENTY THREE POINT FOUR SIX YEN
c0vc022h HE WAS A DIGGER THEN BUT HE FOUND THIS DIAMOND LYING ON THE GROUND
c0vc022i HE FELL ON IT SPEECHLESS IN HIS EXCITEMENT CLUTCHING IT IN HIS FIST
c0vc022j HIS FELLOW DIGGERS AT FIRST FEARED MR. SCHALL HAD SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK
c0wc0201 COMMERCIAL BANKS ARE SEEKING THIS KIND OF BUSINESS BECAUSE SOME OF THEIR LINES LENDING TO BLUE CHIP CORPORATIONS FOR EXAMPLE HAVE DRIED UP
c0wc0202 BIG COMPANIES NOW ISSUE THEIR OWN PAPER
c0wc0203 THE OLD GLASS STEAGALL ARGUMENTS AIMED AT LIMITING RISK AND DANGERS THAT BIG BANKS WOULD END UP CONTROLLING INDUSTRY LOOK MORE AND MORE DATED
c0wc0204 INVESTMENT BANKS PROVIDE BILLIONS IN BRIDGE LOANS FOR CORPORATE RESTRUCTURINGS AND TAKEOVERS
c0wc0205 INVESTMENT BANKS SEEKING MORE CASH WILL BE ABLE TO TEAM UP WITH COMMERCIAL BANKS WITHOUT HAVING TO LOOK ABROAD AS GOLDMAN SACHS DID TO FIND JAPAN'S SUMITOMO BANK
c0wc0206 BUT THE NEW LAW ALSO CONTAINS NEGATIVES FOR MUNICIPAL BONDS
c0wc0207 FOR PEOPLE WHO MUST PAY THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX THE PRIVATE PURPOSE VARIETY IS NOW SUBJECT TO TAX
c0wc0208 AND THE LOWERING OF TAX BRACKETS MEANS THAT THE SHELTER FEATURE IS LESS CRUCIAL THAN IT ONCE WAS
c0wc0209 THE BROADCASTING PROPERTIES HAVE LONG BEEN REGARDED AS GENCORP'S BEST DEFENSE AGAINST A HOSTILE TAKEOVER
c0wc020a LICENSES FOR TWO OF THE TELEVISION STATIONS AND ALL THE RADIO STATIONS ARE BEING CHALLENGED BY GROUPS WHO CHARGE THAT GENCORP IS AN UNFIT OPERATOR
c0wc020b THE DISPUTE INCLUDES ALLEGATIONS THAT GENCORP FAILED TO ADEQUATELY INFORM THE F. C. C. OF ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND FOREIGN PAYMENTS
c0wc020c WHAT EVER GENCORP DOES IT'S GOT TO BE A MASTERPIECE A VAN GOGH
c0wc020d IF THEY DO THE WRONG THING THEY'LL END UP IN PLAY AGAIN SAYS RICHARD L. HAYDON MANAGING DIRECTOR OF BREAN MURRAY FOSTER SECURITIES
c0wc020e HE'D PREFER A DISTRIBUTION OF NINETY DOLLARS CASH PLUS TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS OF SUBORDINATED DEBT AS WELL AS SOME CONTINUING EQUITY FOR CURRENT HOLDERS
c0wc020f ENERGY EXPERTS CONSIDER AMOCO AND EXXON AMONG THE INDUSTRY'S HEALTHIEST COMPANIES FINANCIALLY WITH STRONG CREDIT RATINGS AND LOW DEBT
c0wc020g AMOCO'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHOW IT HAD FOUR HUNDRED FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES ON HAND AT THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
c0wc020h IN RECENT TALKS WITH ANALYSTS AMOCO OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THAT THE COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED FINANCIALLY IF IT DECIDES TO MAKE AN ACQUISITION
c0wc020i HE TOOK THE TAG NUMBER OF THEIR CAR MR. CLIFTON RECALLED REFERRING TO MR. MCGEE
c0wc020j AND HE CAME AND GOT ME AND SAID HEY THIS IS THE REAL THING
c0wc020k IT'S NOT A FLUKE
c0wc020l IT APPEARS TO BE TRUE
c0wc020m ISRAEL'S SHAMIR HOPES TO AVOID LOOKING LIKE THE SPOILER OF PEACE PROSPECTS BY FLOATING A REGIONAL PEACE CONFERENCE PLAN INVOLVING ONLY ISRAEL AND ARAB STATES
c0wc020n HE BILLS IT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO RIVAL PERES'S PLAN FOR AN INTERNATIONAL MEETING LEADING TO ISRAEL JORDAN TALKS
c0wc020o BUT JORDAN AND THE PALESTINIANS BOTH FIND SHAMIR'S PLAN UNACCEPTABLE
c0wc020p THE SENATE APPROVED A NINE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL FOR FISCAL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WHICH WAS AMENDED TO REQUIRE IMMIGRANTS TO UNDERGO AIDS TESTING
c0wc020q IT WAS PASSED SEVENTY ONE TO TWENTY THREE
c0wc020r THE AMENDMENT WAS THE FIRST CONGRESSIONAL BACKING FOR MANDATORY SCREENING FOR THE DISEASE
c0wc020s PRODUCERS HOWEVER SAY THE GUILD DEMAND REALLY REPRESENTS AN EFFORT TO SQUEEZE IN MORE THAN ONE SESSION A DAY
c0wc020t THE ACTORS ARE PAID BY THE SESSION NOT BY THE HOUR AND BOTH SIDES AGREE THAT SESSIONS RARELY EXCEED THREE HOURS
c0wc020u AND WITH THE GUILD CHOOSING SUCH A CRITICAL TIME FOR THE STRIKE T. V. PRODUCTION OFFICIALS ARE ESPECIALLY IRATE
c0wc020v IN TOKYO THE NIKKEI STOCK AVERAGE DECLINED THREE HUNDRED FORTY THREE POINT SIX SEVEN POINTS TO TWENTY THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO POINT FOUR TWO
c0wc020w TURNOVER INCREASED TO SIX HUNDRED MILLION SHARES FROM FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION SHARES TUESDAY
c0wc020x LOSERS OUTNUMBERED GAINERS SIX HUNDRED THIRTY NINE TO TWO HUNDRED SIXTY NINE
c0wc020y THE STRIKE WAS CALLED TO PRESS DEMANDS FOR A THIRTY PERCENT WAGE INCREASE ADDITIONAL HOME LEAVE AND DANGER PAY
c0wc020z BUT MR. RAMAPHOSA SAID THE STRIKE ALSO WAS A CRUCIAL TEST OF STRENGTH BETWEEN THE WHITE MINE OWNERS AND HIS BLACK UNION
c0wc0210 HE SAID IT WAS UP TO THE CHAMBER OF MINES TO MAKE THE NEXT MOVE
c0wc0211 BUT EVEN INVESTORS WHO DO ALL THE HOMEWORK AND REQUEST ALL THE DOCUMENTS SHOULDN'T FEEL TOO COMPLACENT
c0wc0212 THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MUST BE UPDATED EVERY YEAR SO NEW PROSPECTUSES ARE ISSUED ANNUALLY
c0wc0213 SOMETIMES ONLY THE PERSHARE DATA TABLE CHANGES BUT OFTEN OTHER REVISIONS ARE INCLUDED
c0wc0214 LONDON'S FINANCIAL TIMES THIRTY SHARE INDEX ROSE THIRTEEN POINT FOUR TO ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY SIX POINT NINE
c0wc0215 THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX ROSE FIFTEEN POINT SEVEN TO TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE POINT FIVE
c0wc0216 IT HAD BEEN UP AS MUCH AS TWENTY EIGHT POINT ONE IN THE LATE MORNING
c0wc0217 THE GOLD MINES INDEX FELL FOUR POINT SIX TO FOUR HUNDRED FORTY FIVE POINT EIGHT
c0wc0218 VOLUME WAS SIX HUNDRED NINETY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES COMPARED WITH FIVE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION WEDNESDAY
c0wc0219 SECURITIES ANALYSTS HOWEVER REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT BASIC LOAN DEMAND
c0wc021a BRENT ERENSEL OF DEAN WITTER REYNOLDS INCORPORATED NOTED LENDING VOLUME GENERALLY ISN'T ROBUST
c0wc021b MARGINS ARE DOWN BECAUSE OF THE NEW TAX LAW AND THE SUSPENSION OF INTEREST PAYMENTS BY BRAZIL
c0wc021c ON THE OTHER HAND HE SAID LOAN PORTFOLIO QUALITY IS IMPROVING AND BANKS ARE GETTING A BETTER GRIP ON CONTROLLING EXPENSES
c0wc021d THE SUN BELT FORECAST PARTLY CLOUDY
c0wc021e ECONOMISTS EXPECT THE SOUTHEAST BUFFERED BY ITS BIG SERVICE ECONOMY TO CONTINUE TO OUTPERFORM THE NATION
c0wc021f BUT SOME OVERBUILT REALESTATE MARKETS COULD GET BASHED AND FLORIDA'S INFLUX OF RETIREES JOB SEEKERS AND TOURISTS COULD DWINDLE
c0wc021g CAMPEAU IS EXPECTED TODAY TO PRESENT TO FEDERATED'S BOARD A DEFINITIVE TAKEOVER ACCORD OF SIXTY EIGHT DOLLARS A SHARE OR SIX POINT OH TWO BILLION DOLLARS
c0wc021h BOTH FIRMS HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATING SINCE THURSDAY NIGHT WHEN FEDERATED AGREED TO OPEN TALKS
c0wc021i IF THE PACT IS ACCEPTED CAMPEAU IS EXPECTED TO SELL MANY OF FEDERATED'S RETAIL CHAINS TO HELP PAY THE HUGE DEBT FROM THE ACQUISITION
c0wc021j WHILE CHRONICLING THE DOINGS OF THE HIGHFALUTIN MAY SEEM LIGHT STUFF TO SOME MR. REVSON SAYS HIS OWN APPROACH TO THE SUBJECT MATTER ISN'T
c0wc021k IT ISN'T JUST THROWING TOGETHER A STRING OF NAMES AND SAYING THEY SIPPED CHAMPAGNE ATE CAVIAR AND WORE BILL BLASS A COLUMNIST SAYS
c0wc021l FACTS ARE IMPORTANT
c0wc021m IF YOU SAY SOMEONE IS WEARING A RED TIE THEN HE SHOULD BE WEARING A RED TIE
c0wc021n THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIRTY SHARE INDEX CLOSED DOWN TWENTY NINE POINT FOUR POINTS AT ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SIX POINT FOUR
c0wc021o VOLUME WAS A HEFTY FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION SHARES COMPARED WITH TUESDAY'S THREE HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION
c0wc021p THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX WAS DOWN THIRTY FIVE POINT EIGHT POINTS AT ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY SIX POINT EIGHT
c0wc021q IT HAS NOW BEEN ELEVEN NIGHTS SINCE THE ARREST OF FRANCIS SEOW FORMER SOLICITOR GENERAL AND LAW SOCIETY PRESIDENT IN SINGAPORE
c0wc021r WHILE PRIME MINISTER LEE KUAN YEW'S GOVERNMENT HAS ADMITTED HOLDING MR. SEOW IT HAS KEPT HIM TOTALLY INCOMMUNICADO
c0wc021s IT HAS REFUSED REQUESTS TO SEE HIM FROM BOTH HIS FAMILY AND HIS LAWYER
c0wc021t YOU'VE HAD A TREMENDOUS FALLOFF HERE THAT'S ONLY GOING TO GET BIGGER AS WE APPROACH THE SUMMER DOLDRUMS ONE TRADER SAYS
c0wc021u HE ESTIMATES THAT INSTITUTIONAL VOLUME HAS TUMBLED FROM YEAR EARLIER LEVELS BY FORTY PERCENT SO FAR THIS MONTH AND THIRTY PERCENT FOR THE YEAR TO DATE
c0wc021v LET'S FACE IT HE SAYS WE NEED COMMISSIONS TO PAY THE BILLS
c0wc021w FAR FROM PREVENTING UNEMPLOYMENT AS MS. LINK CONTENDS MEXICO'S SOCIALIZED ECONOMY HAS CREATED UNPRECEDENTED JOBLESSNESS
c0wc021x AN ESTIMATED FORTY PERCENT OF ITS WORK FORCE IS TODAY UNEMPLOYED OR UNDEREMPLOYED
c0wc021y POIGNANT TESTIMONY TO THE PLIGHT OF MEXICAN WORKERS AND PEASANTS AFTER NEARLY SIX DECADES OF SOCIALIST RULE IS THEIR CEASELESS DAILY FLIGHT NORTHWARD IN SEARCH OF JOBS
c0wc021z THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO START SHIPPING THE MACHINE THIS MONTH
c0wc0220 BUT DON'T TOSS ALL YOUR PADS OF PAPER INTO THE GARBAGE YET
c0wc0221 THE MACHINE HAS SOME LIMITATIONS
c0wc0222 YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THE STYLUS BETWEEN CHARACTERS
c0wc0223 THE MACHINE ALSO CONVERTS HANDWRITING AT THE SLUGGISH PACE OF TWO SYMBOLS PER SECOND
c0wc0224 AT TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS TO THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS IT WILL COST MORE THAN MOST CONVENTIONAL PORTABLE P. C.S
c0wc0225 PERSISTENT STRENGTH ON THE JOB FRONT IS WIDELY SEEN AS A MAJOR REASON FOR THE STOCK MARKET CRASH'S MILD IMPACT ON CONSUMER SPENDING
c0wc0226 A FEDERAL RESERVE ECONOMIST SAYS THAT FOR ALL THE ATTENTION ACCORDED THE MARKET STOCK EQUITIES ARE AMONG THE MOST CONCENTRATED OF ALL ASSET HOLDINGS
c0wc0227 A FED STUDY SHOWS THAT THE TOP TEN PERCENT OF WEALTH HOLDERS OWN OVER NINETY PERCENT OF ALL STOCK
c0wc0228 AFFLUENT PEOPLE USUALLY AREN'T UNDER HEAVY PRESSURE TO CUT THEIR SPENDING
c0wc0229 E. C. OFFICIALS ARGUE THAT INCREASED CROSSBORDER MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS IN EUROPE HAVE MADE ANTITRUST ISSUES MORE THAN A NATIONAL AFFAIR
c0wc022a IN THE IRISH DISTILLERS BID NO SINGLE GOVERNMENT WAS IN A POSITION TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE EUROPEAN WHISKEY MARKET
c0wc022b E. C. OFFICIALS SAY WHISKEY PRICES WOULD HAVE RISEN THROUGHOUT THE E. C.
c0wc022c WORLD BANK PRESIDENT BARBER CONABLE SAID THE BANK WILL SEND A DELEGATION TO ARGENTINA NEXT WEEK TO REVIEW THE MEASURES
c0wc022d IF THE BANK APPROVES THE DETAILS THE BRIDGE LOAN WOULD GO FORWARD AND THE WORLD BANK LOANS WOULD BE COMPLETED
c0wc022e A BANK SPOKESMAN SAID THAT DETAILS OF THOSE LOANS WON'T BE KNOWN UNTIL THE DELEGATION COMPLETES ITS WORK
c0wc022f QUITE POSSIBLY A RECENT PROFIT SHARING BONUS HELPED
c0wc022g WE DON'T HAVE AN ELEGANT FORMULA SAYS MR. BARRON
c0wc022h WE SAID WE THINK EVERYONE'S ENTITLED TO A SHARE SO HERE'S A CHECK
c0wc022i NEXT YEAR IF WE DO WELL THERE MAY BE A BIGGER CHECK
c0wc022j IS THIS ANY WAY TO RUN A RAILROAD
c0wc022k COULD BE
c0xc0201 TWO YEARS AGO HE TRIED TO BRING CHEAPER GASOLINE TO JAPAN FROM SINGAPORE ONLY TO RUN INTO GOVERNMENT OPPOSITION
c0xc0202 NOW HE IS ENGAGED ONCE MORE IN A CAMPAIGN AGAINST WHAT HE CALLS THE GOVERNMENT'S OVERREGULATION OF THE JAPANESE ECONOMY
c0xc0203 THE TARGET OF THIS SALVO IS HIS COUNTRY'S NEAR TOTAL BAN ON RICE IMPORTS
c0xc0204 MR. JACOBS HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS TO LEAVE ON FEBRUARY FIRST TO FORM A NEW FIRM WITH ANOTHER PARTNER JOHN F. GERARD
c0xc0205 SEVERAL STAFF MEMBERS PLAN TO LEAVE WITH HIM
c0xc0206 MR. JACOBS SAID HIS DEPARTURE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FIRM'S PROBLEMS
c0xc0207 I'M NOT A BIG FIRM KIND OF GUY HE SAID
c0xc0208 I DON'T WANT TO LIVE BY CONSENSUS
c0xc0209 AND WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT GROUPS WAVING THE COMPETITIVENESS FLAG WON'T THE ARGUMENT GET A LITTLE SHOPWORN
c0xc020a SAYS MR. KAY IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT IMPROVING U. S. COMPETITIVENESS ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS HAS TO BE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
c0xc020b BUT YES TO THE EXTENT THIS TOWN BECOMES CYNICAL ABOUT COMPETITIVENESS BEING USED TO COVER EVERYTHING ON FOUR LEGS IT WILL HURT US
c0xc020c CLASS A STOCK HAS ONE TWENTIETH OF A VOTE PER SHARE AND WILL RECEIVE AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND OF TEN CENTS A SHARE PAYABLE QUARTERLY
c0xc020d CLASS B. STOCK HAS ONE VOTE PER SHARE BUT PRESIDIO HAS SAID IT DOESN'T PLAN TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON THOSE SHARES

c0xc020m ADVISERS HOPE FOR PROGRESS ON ARMS CONTROL PERHAPS INCLUDING A REAGAN GORBACHEV SUMMIT IN THE U. S.
c0xc020n THE CALL IS LIKELY TO PROMPT HOLDERS TO CONVERT THE SHARES INTO COMMON RATHER THAN HAVE THEM REDEEMED
c0xc020o EACH DEPOSITARY SHARE CAN BE CONVERTED INTO ONE AND TWO THIRDS COMMON
c0xc020p AS LONG AS THE COMMON IS ABOVE SIXTEEN DOLLARS AND FIFTY NINE CENTS A SHARE THE COMPANY NOTED THE CONVERSION VALUE EXCEEDS THE REDEMPTION PRICE
c0xc020q THE OFFER EXPIRES AT FIVE P. M. E. D. T. JULY FIRST
c0xc020r ARE WE MAKING EXACTLY THE RIGHT BALANCE
c0xc020s PROBABLY NOT
c0xc020t BUT IT IS A CONSCIOUS AND DELIBERATE ATTEMPT ON OUR PART TO BALANCE THESE NEAR TERM AND LONGTERM REQUIREMENTS
c0xc020u THE RESULTS LOOK PRETTY GOOD HOWEVER AND SUGGEST THAT MAYBE AFTER ALL THERE ARE A GOOD MANY INTERESTS TO CONSIDER IN RUNNING A SUCCESSFUL COMPANY
c0xc020v ON THE BIG BOARD VOLUME ROSE TO TWO HUNDRED TWENTY POINT FIVE MILLION SHARES FROM ONE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION THURSDAY
c0xc020w BUT THE ACTIVITY WAS LESS THAN ON PREVIOUS TRIPLE WITCHING DAYS AND MUCH OF THE TRADING WAS PACKED INTO THE OPENING AND CLOSING MINUTES OF THE SESSION
c0xc020x MORE THAN THIRTY ONE MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS IN THE FINAL MINUTE
c0xc020y THE QUESTION WAS WHAT FORM THIS CONFLICT WOULD TAKE
c0xc020z THE CIVIL WAR WAS FINALLY FOUGHT OVER MAINTAINING THE UNION
c0xc0210 BUT WHAT IF THERE HAD BEEN NO UNION
c0xc0211 WHAT IF THE SOUTH HAD BEEN A SEPARATE NATION
c0xc0212 WOULD SOUTHERNERS BLACK OR WHITE HAVE EVER ACHIEVED FULL EQUALITY IF THEY HAD BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE UNION AS A CONQUERED PROVINCE
c0xc0213 OR WHAT IF THE WAR HAD BEEN AVOIDED AND SLAVERY JUST DRIFTED ON AND ON
c0xc0214 WOULD THE SOUTH HAVE BECOME ANOTHER SOUTH AFRICA
c0xc0215 I WOULDN'T BET AGAINST IT
c0xc0216 REPRESENTATIVE GEPHARDT IS AT AGE FORTY SIX THE EMBODIMENT OF THE COOL POST WATERGATE POLITICIAN
c0xc0217 HIS HAIR NEVER SEEMS RUFFLED HIS TIE WOULD NO DOUBT HANG STRAIGHT DOWN IN A TYPHOON

c0xc0219 THE CHEMISTRY RESEARCH BY MESSRS.
c0xc021a CRAM PEDERSEN AND LEHN COULD BE USED TO SEPARATE RADIOACTIVE TISSUES FROM OTHER TISSUES AND FOR THE PURIFICATION OF MOLECULES AND MAY HAVE FUTURE APPLICATION IN ENERGY PRODUCTION
c0xc021b IN ANNOUNCING THE CHEMISTRY PRIZE THE SWEDISH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES CITED THE WORK BY THE THREE IN MAKING RELATIVELY UNCOMPLICATED COMPOUNDS THAT PERFORM THE SAME FUNCTIONS AS NATURAL PROTEINS
c0xc021c UNDER THE PLAN THE EDELMAN GROUP WOULD CONTRIBUTE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN EQUITY TO THE TRANSACTION
c0xc021d THE REMAINDER WOULD BE FINANCED WITH DEBT AND DEBT SECURITIES
c0xc021e IF THE PLAN SUCCEEDS SHEARSON WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE WARRANTS TO BUY TEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT OF THE FULLY DILUTED COMMON EQUITY OF THE COMPANY
c0xc021f BUT OTHERS NOTABLY WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT ADVISERS PRESSED ON
c0xc021h MANY STOCK PRICES HADN'T BEEN UPDATED IN SEVERAL MINUTES HE EXPLAINS AND IT WAS LIKELY THAT SUBSEQUENT STOCK TRADES WOULD BE AT EVEN LOWER LEVELS
c0xc021i BY DAY'S END WELLS SOLD FOURTEEN THOUSAND FUTURES CONTRACTS AMOUNTING TO NEARLY TWO BILLION DOLLARS
c0xc021j IT WAS A YAWN RICHARD WITTEN A VICE PRESIDENT AT GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY SAID OF THE STATEMENT
c0xc021k THIS THING WAS WRITTEN A MONTH AGO
c0xc021l THEY HAMMERED OUT A LOT OF AMBIGUOUS LANGUAGE THAT SATISFIED EVERYBODY AND DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING VERY CLEARLY ABOUT WHERE CURRENCY MARKETS WILL GO

c0xc0220 OTHER E. C. STATES ALSO HAVE RESERVATIONS THOUGH THEY DON'T FEEL AS STRONGLY ABOUT THEM AS DOES BRITAIN
c0xc0221 DENMARK FOR EXAMPLE WORRIES IT MIGHT HAVE TO TIGHTEN CONTROLS ON ITS NON E. C. NORDIC NEIGHBORS
c0xc0222 IRELAND WANTS TO ENSURE THAT FREER BORDERS GO HAND IN HAND WITH CLOSER SECURITY COOPERATION AMONG E. C. NATIONS
c0xc0223 MR. WOLF SAID IN A STATEMENT THAT THE DECISION WAS MADE AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AND HE NOTED THAT UNITED NEEDS THE MONEY
c0xc0224 AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THE COMPANY'S HEAVY DEBT HAS KEPT IT FROM BUYING AIRCRAFT
c0xc0225 THESE FUNDS WILL PROVIDE THE NEEDED FLEXIBILITY TO ENABLE UNITED AIRLINES TO COMPETE MORE AGGRESSIVELY MR. WOLF SAID
c0xc0226 IN THE POSITION I'M IN I COULD RAISE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY IN TEN DAYS MORE THAN I WOULD NEED HE SAYS
c0xc0227 BUT I WON'T DO IT
c0xc0228 I WOULD BE DEFEATED BEFORE I WOULD ACCEPT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS
c0xc0229 THOSE EDITORS WHO HAVE PLUNGED IN ARE FINDING THAT AN ELECTRONIC OFFSHOOT CAN HELP THEM PUT OUT A MAGAZINE
c0xc022b NOT LONG AGO BYTE EDITORS WANDERING THROUGH BIX WERE STRUCK BY INSIGHTFUL COMMENTS ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS FROM A SUBSCRIBER IN SAN DIEGO
c0xc022c TODAY THE SUBSCRIBER BROCK MEEKS IS A REGULAR BYTE CONTRIBUTOR ONE OF SEVERAL THE MAGAZINE HAS RECRUITED FROM BIX
c0xc022d WE KNOW THAT THESE THEORETICAL ECONOMIC CONCEPTS DO NOT ALWAYS WORK OUT PERFECTLY IN THE REAL WORLD
c0xc022e ON THE OTHER HAND WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE ESSENTIAL IF WE ARE TO UNDERSTAND AND EXPLAIN PRICES INTEREST RATES AND INVESTMENT DECISIONS
c0xc022f THESE CONCEPTS HAVE WORKED ABOUT AS WELL IN SANTIAGO AND SYDNEY AS THEY HAVE WORKED IN TOKYO AND SAN FRANCISCO
c0xc022g BASICALLY SAYS MS. BANK WE DON'T GIVE KITTENS TO PEOPLE WHO WORK
c0xc022h KITTENS NEED SOCIALIZATION
c0xc022i ONCE A KITTEN IS MORE THAN FOUR MONTHS OLD IT IS CONSIDERED MATURE ENOUGH BY THE A. S. P. C. A. TO BE ON ITS OWN DURING THE DAY
c0yc0201 A. T. THIS POINT COMPETING DEVELOPERS WERE EYEING THE PROJECT
c0yc0202 UNDER ITS GROUND LEASE WITH THE CITY AND STATE THE PARTNERSHIP MIGHT BE FOUND IN DEFAULT ON ITS CONTRACT ENABLING A COMPETING DEVELOPER TO TAKE OVER
c0yc0203 TO STAVE OFF AN ATTACK MR. HARRISON SAYS OUR POSITION WAS THAT WE WERE NEVER IN DEFAULT ON OUR LEASE
c0yc0204 WE MAINTAIN THAT THE BANK STOPPED FUNDING
c0yc0205 WHAT IF ANYTHING WILL COME OF ALL THIS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN REMAINS TO BE SEEN OF COURSE
c0yc0206 THE YEAR ALSO MAY YIELD ANSWERS TO SOME OTHER QUESTIONS CURRENTLY PUZZLING INVESTORS WILL THE ECONOMY FINALLY GET MOVING AGAIN
c0yc0207 AND IF IT DOES WILL RENEWED INFLATION BE ALL BUT INEVITABLE
c0yc0208 WILL THE POLITICAL REALIGNMENT IN CONGRESS HELP OR HURT EFFORTS TO WHITTLE THE NATION'S HUGE TRADE AND BUDGET DEFICITS
c0yc0209 I THINK THEY'RE WRONG TENNESSEE GOVERNOR LAMAR ALEXANDER THE COMMISSION CHAIRMAN SAID OF THE OPPOSITION
c0yc020a HE SAID MOST OF THE PROPOSED LAND USE RESTRICTIONS WOULD BE IMPOSED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS
c0yc020b BUT HE CONCEDED THAT SECTIONS OF THE REPORT ON FEDERAL LANDS ARE BEING REWRITTEN
c0yc020c RAYTHEON DENIED THAT IT'S FREELY GIVING AWAY JOBS
c0yc020d WE AREN'T CRAZY ABOUT OFFSETS BUT WE'D ENTER INTO THEM AS A COMPROMISE BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT IF IT'S THE BEST THAT'S AVAILABLE SAID RAYTHEON SPOKESMAN LAWRENCE MCCRACKEN
c0yc020e HE ADDED THAT THERE WERE ALSO SOME POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS BEHIND THE DECISION TO SHARE THE PATRIOT BUSINESS WITH THE THREE U. S. ALLIES
c0yc020f THREE OTHER BORDER CITIES ACCUSTOMED TO HARD TIMES HAVE BEEN ADDING JOBS AT A PACE WELL ABOVE THE STATE AVERAGE
c0yc020g EL PASO'S EMPLOYMENT ROSE THREE PERCENT IN THE YEAR ENDING IN JANUARY
c0yc020h IN LAREDO AND BROWNSVILLE HARLINGEN JOB GROWTH WAS TWO PERCENT
c0yc020i FOR TEXAS AS A WHOLE EMPLOYMENT WAS ESSENTIALLY FLAT IN THE SAME PERIOD
c0yc020j ALL THREE OF THESE BORDER COMMUNITIES HAD UNEMPLOYMENT RATES IN TWO FIGURES
c0yc020k IT IS A MISSION THAT REMAINS RELEVANT IN THE POST SEGREGATION ERA
c0yc020l MANY CURRENT MOREHOUSE STUDENTS WERE OFFERED SCHOLARSHIPS BY PREDOMINANTLY WHITE SCHOOLS BUT CAME HERE INSTEAD
c0yc020m FOR EXAMPLE ARCHIE RICH A DETROIT PAROCHIAL SCHOOL GRADUATE TURNED DOWN A DIVING SCHOLARSHIP FROM MICHIGAN'S OAKLAND UNIVERSITY IN FAVOR OF MOREHOUSE
c0yc020n I'VE ALWAYS FELT A STRONG RESPONSIBILITY TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY HE SAYS
c0yc020o MR. WILCOX AS F. P. L.'S CHIEF ECOLOGIST IS THE UTILITY'S POINT MAN FOR THE BIG REPTILES
c0yc020p THIS MORNING HE IS LOBBYING PLANT MANAGERS WHO HAVE JOINED HIM ON THE INSPECTION TOUR TO CREATE BUFFER ZONES AROUND ANY CROCODILE NESTS THEY FIND
c0yc020q BY AFTERNOON THE MANAGERS AGREE
c0yc020r PROFIT WAS IN LINE WITH ANALYSTS' EXPECTATIONS THAT WESTINGHOUSE WOULD EARN BETWEEN ONE DOLLAR AND TWENTY CENTS AND ONE DOLLAR AND TWENTY SEVEN CENTS A SHARE IN THE QUARTER
c0yc020s IN THE LATEST QUARTER WESTINGHOUSE HAD ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR POINT NINE MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING DOWN FROM ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION A YEAR EARLIER
c0yc020t IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS AN EXCELLENT QUARTER SAID GAIL LANDIS OF SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN AND COMPANY
c0yc020u SHE NOTED THE STRONG IMPROVEMENT IN THE COMPANY'S OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN DURING THE QUARTER TO EIGHT POINT EIGHT PERCENT FROM SEVEN POINT FOUR PERCENT LAST YEAR
c0yc020v ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THE QUARTER'S SALES WERE FLAT WHEN CONSIDERING THE ABSENCE OF THE CABLE OPERATIONS
c0yc020w THE DELAYS ARE HAVING AN EFFECT
c0yc020x ALLEGIS STOCK HAS BEEN VOLATILE RECENTLY IN HEAVY TRADING
c0yc020y IN COMPOSITE TRADING YESTERDAY ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE ALLEGIS CLOSED AT NINETY SIX DOLLARS UP TWELVE POINT FIVE CENTS
c0yc020z COMPUTER MAKERS AND THE CUSTOMS SERVICE DISAGREE OVER HOW MOTHER BOARDS WERE PREVIOUSLY TREATED FOR TARIFF PURPOSES
c0yc0210 THE CUSTOMS SERVICE SAYS THE INTEL RULING ONLY REAFFIRMED LONGTIME TARIFF POLICY AND DIDN'T REPRESENT A CHANGE
c0yc0211 BUT THE TRADE GROUP SAYS IT HAS EVIDENCE GOING BACK FOR FIFTEEN YEARS THAT THE BOARDS HAVE BEEN LEVIED AS PARTS NOT COMPUTERS
c0yc0212 CHIEF AUTO PARTS WITH STORES PRIMARILY IN TEXAS AND CALIFORNIA HAD LOSSES IN THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND IS NOW PROFITABLE
c0yc0213 WE THINK WE COULD ADD SOME OF OUR SYSTEMS AND OUR MARKETING IDEAS AND MAKE IT HEALTHY MR. HAFT SAID
c0yc0214 IT'S IN MARKETS WE'RE ALREADY IN
c0yc0215 BUT EVEN INVESTORS WHO DO ALL THE HOMEWORK AND REQUEST ALL THE DOCUMENTS SHOULDN'T FEEL TOO COMPLACENT
c0yc0216 THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MUST BE UPDATED EVERY YEAR SO NEW PROSPECTUSES ARE ISSUED ANNUALLY
c0yc0217 SOMETIMES ONLY THE PERSHARE DATA TABLE CHANGES BUT OFTEN OTHER REVISIONS ARE INCLUDED
c0yc0218 TRADING THIS WEEK MAY INDICATE THE MARKET'S DIRECTION WITH THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS NEAR THE OCTOBER NINETEENTH LOW
c0yc0219 LAST WEEK STOCK PRICES WERE SENT TUMBLING BY SKITTISH INVESTORS MANY OF WHOM ARE CONCERNED WITH STAGFLATION
c0yc021a BOND PRICES FELL FRIDAY
c0yc021b RESIDENTS HERE SAY ONE MIGHT EXPECT SUCH GOINGS ON IN MIAMI OR FORT LAUDERDALE BUT NOT IN SLEEPY WINTER HAVEN
c0yc021c THE BIGGEST SCAM IN RECENT MEMORY WAS A RABBIT BREEDING SCHEME THAT LURED LOCALS INTO BUYING AND RAISING BUNNIES FOR PELTS IN THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES
c0yc021d NOW THEY ARE BRACING FOR THE AFTERSHOCKS OF S. H. OIL'S FALL
c0yc021e STATE WORKERS ARE ANOTHER CONSTITUENCY
c0yc021f ONE IN FOUR WORKING PANAMANIANS OWES HIS LIVELIHOOD TO THE GOVERNMENT AND THE GENERAL EXPECTS HELP FROM ALL OF THEM
c0yc021g DOWN THE STREET FROM MR. SANCHEZ'S SHOP CARLOS A GOVERNMENT MECHANIC SAYS HE GOES TO MANY PRO NORIEGA DEMONSTRATIONS
c0yc021h TURNOUT IS ANOTHER UNKNOWN FACTOR
c0yc021i TO CAPITALIZE HERE GOVERNOR DUKAKIS WOULD LIKE TO SEE A HEAVY TURNOUT ESPECIALLY IN SUCH POCKETS OF STRENGTH AS THE CHICAGO LAKEFRONT AND SUBURBS
c0yc021j BUT THAT MAY NOT HAPPEN ILLINOIS REGISTRATION IS BELOW NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND NO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS YET CAUGHT FIRE
c0yc021k MOST FUNERALS ARE TERRIBLY DIGNIFIED AFFAIRS
c0yc021l DIGNIFIED MUSIC DIGNIFIED WORDS AND FROM THE FLORIST DIGNIFIED FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS
c0yc021m ALMOST AN EXCESS OF DIGNITY YOU MIGHT SAY
c0yc021n THE GRAND METROPOLITAN OPERATIONS WHICH WERE ACQUIRED BY THAT COMPANY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY HAVE ENJOYED A GOOD REPUTATION IN THE INDUSTRY
c0yc021o BUT PEPSICO FEELS ITS TERRITORIES CAN BE BETTER EXPLOITED DUE TO THEIR PROXIMITY TO EXISTING COMPANY OWNED BOTTLERS
c0yc021p IT OWNS ITS LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO BOTTLERS FOR INSTANCE MAKING THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA TERRITORY A GOOD FIT
c0yc021q IT ALREADY OWNS ITS BOTTLERS IN CENTRAL AND NORTHERN FLORIDA AND PARTS OF GEORGIA
c0yc021r THERE ARE SOME GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO MAXIMIZE PRODUCTION AND MARKETING EFFICIENCIES THE PEPSICO SPOKESMAN SAID
c0yc021s IT IS CALLED LIPOPROTEIN BRACKETS A. OR SIMPLY L. P. BRACKETS A.
c0yc021t SCIENTISTS PRONOUNCE IT L. P. LITTLE A.
c0yc021u IT WAS SPOTTED TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO BUT LONG IGNORED BY MAINSTREAM HEART RESEARCHERS
c0yc021v NOW A SERIES OF DISCOVERIES HAS MADE IT THE FOCUS OF A NEW STRATEGY TO UNDERSTAND ATHEROSCLEROSIS THE ARTERY CLOGGING DISEASE THAT IS THE NATION'S LEADING KILLER
c0yc021w PATTEN RETAINS LAND SPECIALISTS WHO KNOW THE REGULATORY ROPES AND HOW TO GET SUBDIVISIONS APPROVED
c0yc021x IN AT LEAST TWO INSTANCES PATTEN SPECIALISTS HAVE BEEN ON TOWN PLANNING BOARDS WHERE PATTEN HAD PROJECTS PENDING THOUGH THEY ABSTAINED FROM VOTING
c0yc021y IN MAINE A KEY SPOKESMAN IS A FORMER STATE LEGISLATOR
c0yc021z RESOLUTION AND TOUGHNESS ARE LOCAL CHARACTERISTICS IN MAGNITOGORSK
c0yc0220 THE STEEL PLANT BUILT ALMOST SIXTY YEARS AGO BY WORKERS AND PRISONERS BECAME A SYMBOL OF STALIN'S RAPID DRIVE TO INDUSTRIALIZE THE COUNTRY AT ANY COST
c0yc0221 DURING WORLD WAR TWO EVERY SECOND SOVIET TANK AND EVERY THIRD SHELL WAS MADE FROM MAGNITOGORSK STEEL
c0yc0222 ROGER AILES THE MAN WHO WILL GUIDE GEORGE BUSH'S HEAVY MEDIA CAMPAIGN IS PUMPING UP HIS ANGER LIKE A LINEMAN PREPARING TO CRUSH THE OPPOSING QUARTERBACK
c0yc0223 MICHAEL DUKAKIS HAS THE TOUGHEST KNEES AND ELBOWS TODAY SAYS THE NEW YORK ADVERTISING EXECUTIVE WHO ONCE PITCHED RICHARD NIXON AS WARM
c0yc0224 HE'S THE MEANEST LITTLE SON OF A BITCH I'VE COME ACROSS IN POLITICS
c0yc0225 MR. JACOBS DESCRIBED THE CURRENT EIGHT PERCENT INFLATION RATE AS HIGHER THAN DESIRABLE
c0yc0226 HE ALSO SAID IT MIGHT ACCELERATE FURTHER OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS BEFORE LEVELING OFF
c0yc0227 BUT THE FINANCIAL SECRETARY SAID HE HOPED THAT PRICE INCREASES LIKE THE LABOR SHORTAGE WOULD EASE IF THE LOCAL ECONOMY SLOWS AS HE HAS PREDICTED
c0yc0228 BUT SERVICE MERCHANDISE JUMPED ONE AND THREE EIGHTHS TO EIGHTEEN AND ONE QUARTER ON ONE POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES
c0yc0229 THE STOCK SLID TO TWELVE AND ONE QUARTER IN SEPTEMBER AFTER THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT AN INVESTOR GROUP HAD DECIDED NOT TO PROCEED WITH A POSSIBLE ACQUISITION OFFER
c0yc022a SINCE THEN THE STOCK HAS BEEN RISING ON TAKEOVER RUMORS
c0yc022b HIGHER COMMISSIONS CAN ALSO REDUCE THE INVESTMENT VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES THAT INCLUDE A SAVINGS COMPONENT SUCH AS UNIVERSAL LIFE POLICIES
c0yc022c IN GENERAL POLICIES WITH HIGHER COMMISSIONS HAVE LOWER SURRENDER VALUES
c0yc022d THAT'S WHAT POLICYHOLDERS GET IF THEY CASH IN THE POLICY OR WHAT THEY CAN BORROW THROUGH POLICY LOANS
c0yc022e THE TREASURY'S BENCHMARK THIRTY YEAR BOND ROSE ONE EIGHTH POINT OR ABOUT ONE DOLLAR AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS FOR EACH ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR FACE AMOUNT
c0yc022f THE ISSUE'S YIELD WHICH MOVES IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION FROM ITS PRICE WAS UNCHANGED FROM WEDNESDAY AT EIGHT POINT ONE FIVE PERCENT
c0yc022g THE TREASURY'S NEW TWO YEAR NOTES WHICH WERE SOLD AT AUCTION EARLIER THIS WEEK ENDED SLIGHTLY HIGHER AT A PRICE TO YIELD EIGHT POINT TWO SEVEN PERCENT
c0zc0201 MR. FUNARO DESCRIBED AS HOT AIR AND NONSENSE FOREIGN BANKERS' LANGUAGE IN THEIR CRITICISM OF BRAZIL'S LACK OF ECONOMIC POLICY
c0zc0202 <NOISE> HE SAID NOBODY WORRIED ABOUT BRAZIL'S HIGH INFLATION WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS PRODUCING BIG SURPLUSES TO MEET DEBT PAYMENTS
c0zc0203 INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR EXCUSES HE SAID THESE BANKS SHOULD REALIZE THERE'S A DEBT CRISIS AND IT HAS TO BE RESOLVED BY BOTH SIDES
c0zc0204 I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO WALK PAST ANYTHING I BELIEVED TO BE WRONG WITHOUT SAYING SOMETHING MR. KAGLER SAYS
c0zc0205 SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY YEAH BUT YOU THINK TOO MUCH IS WRONG
c0zc0206 MAYBE I COULD HAVE BEEN MORE DIPLOMATIC
c0zc0207 BUT NO I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY
c0zc0208 <NOISE> INSTEAD A NEW YORK CORPORATION CALLED N. P. M. GROUP PROVIDES THE COMPANY WITH PERSONNEL WHO FUNCTION IN SENIOR EXECUTIVE CAPACITIES
c0zc0209 WHO OWNS N. P. M.
c0zc020a NELSON PELTZ AND PETER MAY
c0zc020b AND WHO DID N. P. M. CHOOSE TO RUN TRIANGLE
c0zc020c THAT'S RIGHT NELSON PELTZ AND PETER MAY
c0zc020f THAT INCLUDES INTEREST OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS AND INVESTMENT BANKING FEES OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS
c0zc020g CONSEQUENTLY LLOYD'S AND SOME BROKERS MAY BE FORCED TO INCREASE THEIR SHARE OF THE SETTLEMENT PAYMENT
c0zc020h YESTERDAY MINET HOLDINGS P. L. C. SAID ITS PLANNED TEN POINT FIVE MILLION POUND CONTRIBUTION COULD RISE TO TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLION POUNDS
c0zc020i LLOYD'S DECLINED TO SPECULATE ABOUT HOW MUCH ITS CONTRIBUTION MIGHT INCREASE
c0zc020j OTHERS DID
c0zc020k ONE COUPLE PAID SEVENTY NINE DOLLARS AND NINETY FIVE CENTS FOR A FIVE INCH PORTABLE TELEVISION
c0zc020l IT RUNS ON TEN SIZE D. BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED THAT NEED TO BE REPLACED EVERY THREE HOURS
c0zc020m ANOTHER PAID FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS IN RETURN FOR A ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR SAVINGS ACCOUNT THAT WON'T MATURE FOR FORTY FIVE YEARS
c0zc020n SUSPICIOUS MERRILL LYNCH CALLED IRWIN L. JACOBS THE MINNEAPOLIS INVESTOR WHOSE VENTURES INCLUDE MINSTAR
c0zc020o MR. JACOBS TOLD THE BROKERAGE THAT THE ORDER WAS A FAKE AND DISMISSED IT AS A PRANK
c0zc020p THE NEXT DAY A SIMILAR WIRE WAS SENT THIS ONE SEEKING TO SELL ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SHARES OF CONTROL DATA
c0zc020q CHIEF AUTO PARTS WITH STORES PRIMARILY IN TEXAS AND CALIFORNIA HAD LOSSES IN THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND IS NOW PROFITABLE
c0zc020r WE THINK WE COULD ADD SOME OF OUR SYSTEMS AND OUR MARKETING IDEAS AND MAKE IT HEALTHY MR. HAFT SAID
c0zc020s IT'S IN MARKETS WE'RE ALREADY IN
c0zc020t THE CONVERTIBLE FEATURE IN THE BONDS WAS AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION
c0zc020u IF THE STOCK PROSPERED THE BONDHOLDERS DID NOT HAVE THE OPTION OF CASHING IN AND TAKING THE GAIN
c0zc020v NO ONE HAS SUGGESTED ROGERS WAS ABOUT TO GO BANKRUPT AND DEFAULT ON ITS BONDS THE ONLY WAY THE INTEREST COULD BE JEOPARDIZED
c0zc020w SO WHEN MR. GINSBURG FILED HIS BRIEF HE HAD NOTHING TO LOSE OR GAIN FROM ITS EFFECT ON ROGERS'S FORTUNES
c0zc020x THE REPORT SIGNALED THE OPENING SALVO IN WHAT APPEARS WILL BE A CONTENTIOUS MEETING DURING WHICH THE THIRTEEN MEMBER CARTEL WILL GRAPPLE WITH PRICE AND PRODUCTION ISSUES
c0zc020y FOUR OPEC MEMBERS IRAN LIBYA ALGERIA AND NIGERIA HAVE CALLED FOR AT LEAST A TWO DOLLAR PRICE INCREASE WHILE OPPOSING ANY HIGHER OUTPUT
c0zc020z THE MINISTERIAL CONFERENCE IS TO BEGIN DECEMBER NINTH IN VIENNA
c0zc0210 ANOTHER REASON MR. SOIFER IS AVOIDING MORGAN AND CITICORP IS THAT THEIR STOCK PRICES AT TIMES HAVE TENDED TO GYRATE MORE VIOLENTLY THAN OTHER BANK ISSUES
c0zc0211 CITICORP AND MORGAN TEND TO HAVE MORE VOLATILITY ON DAYS WHEN PROGRAM TRADING IS KNOWN TO OCCUR MR. SOIFER SAYS
c0zc0212 THEY'RE MORE OF A BET ON WHICH WAY THE MARKET IS HEADED
c0zc0213 NEWS OF A DISAPPOINTING DECLINE IN THE AUGUST TRADE GAP PUSHED THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE DOWN NEARLY NINETY SEVEN POINTS OCTOBER FOURTEENTH
c0zc0214 THE BOND MARKET AND THE DOLLAR ALSO TUMBLED
c0zc0215 THE TURMOIL OF THAT DAY WAS FOLLOWED BY A STUNNING PLUNGE OF FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHT POINTS JUST THREE SESSIONS LATER
c0zc0216 AMONG FINANCIAL STOCKS BROKERAGES TENDED TO BE SOLD
c0zc0217 NOMURA SECURITIES EASED THIRTY TO TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY
c0zc0218 NIKKO DROPPED TWENTY TO ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY
c0zc0219 AT SCHWAB THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT CAPITAL BUDGET IS ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT LESS THAN THE AMOUNT BEING SPENT THIS YEAR ACCORDING TO LAWRENCE STUPSKI SCHWAB'S PRESIDENT
c0zc021a BEFORE THE CRASH SCHWAB EXPECTED TO OPEN THIRTY NEW OFFICES IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS
c0zc021b BUT MR. STUPSKI SAID THAT NUMBER HAS BEEN CUT ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT BECAUSE OF THE OUTLOOK FOR LOWER VOLUMES
c0zc021c ISRAELI SOLDIERS WOUNDED THREE ARABS IN THE WEST BANK AND GAZA STRIP AS PALESTINIAN YOUTHS STONED CARS AND TORCHED BUSES TO ENFORCE A GENERAL STRIKE
c0zc021d IN WASHINGTON THE WHITE HOUSE REAFFIRMED ITS SUPPORT FOR EXCHANGING TERRITORY FOR PEACE AS PART OF A MIDEAST AGREEMENT
c0zc021e ISRAELI PREMIER SHAMIR HAS EXPRESSED OPPOSITION TO THE PLAN
c0zc021f AFTER THREE MONTHS ON THE JOB SESSIONS SAY HIS AGENDA IS JUST BEGINNING TO DEVELOP
c0zc021g HE HAS INDICATED THAT PRIORITIES WOULD INCLUDE BANK FRAUD ENFORCEMENT AND TIGHTENING F. B. I. PROCEDURES FOR UNDERCOVER PROBES
c0zc021h CRITICS SAY THAT UNDER HIS CAUTIOUS APPROACH THE F. B. I. FAILED TO DEFEND ITSELF QUICKLY ENOUGH AGAINST RECENT ALLEGATIONS OF POLITICALLY MOTIVATED INVESTIGATIONS
c0zc021i THE MOVE BY VALLEY FEDERAL CAME AS THE THRIFT'S SHAREHOLDERS VOTED AT ITS ANNUAL MEETING ON A RESOLUTION AND SLATE OF THREE DIRECTORS PROPOSED BY HECCO
c0zc021j RESULTS OF THE VOTE WEREN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE RELEASED LATER THIS WEEK
c0zc021k ONLY THREE OF THE THRIFT'S TEN DIRECTORS WERE UP FOR REELECTION
c0zc021l THE MONTHLY TRADE FIGURES COMMAND CLOSER ATTENTION THAN ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT REPORT
c0zc021m LAST MONTH'S REPORT SHOWING AN UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE THIRTEEN POINT EIGHT THREE BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT IN FEBRUARY TRIGGERED A SHARP SELLOFF IN BOTH THE DOLLAR AND TREASURY BONDS
c0zc021n THE STOCK MARKET REACTED EVEN MORE DRASTICALLY THAT DAY AS THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE TUMBLED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED POINTS
c0zc021o AMONG THE SEVENTY EIGHT BOND FUNDS TRACKED FOR THE ASSOCIATION WARDLEY GLOBAL SELECT STERLING BOND FUND TURNED IN THE QUARTER'S BEST RETURN OF ELEVEN POINT FOUR PERCENT
c0zc021p REFLECTING THE STRENGTH OF THE POUND BRITISH BOND FUNDS PERFORMED BEST AS A GROUP WITH A SEVEN POINT ONE PERCENT MEDIAN RETURN
c0zc021q FUNDS HEAVILY INVESTED IN U. S. AND SWISS BONDS YIELDED THE QUARTER'S POOREST RETURNS
c0zc021r IN KEY DAIRY STATES MILK PRODUCTION ROSE SHARPLY DURING THE PROGRAM
c0zc021s IN CALIFORNIA PRODUCTION INCREASED TWO POINT EIGHT PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AND SIX POINT NINE PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
c0zc021t IN TEXAS IT WAS UP THREE PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AND EIGHT POINT FOUR PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
c0zc021u THE TOTAL CUT WOULD CORRESPOND TO THE AMOUNT OF COFFEE SOLD AND NOT EXCEED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND BAGS
c0zc021v ONE BAG EQUALS SIXTY KILOS
c0zc021w THE ANNUAL GLOBAL EXPORT QUOTA IS FIFTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION BAGS
c0zc021x MR. AGEE SAID THE LOSSES WERE A DISAPPOINTMENT AND A SURPRISE TO THE BOARD TOO
c0zc021y THAT SUGGESTS THAT MR. AGEE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN TO SHAKE THINGS UP
c0zc021z IN A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW FRIDAY MR. AGEE DIDN'T RULE ANYTHING OUT
c0zc0220 STEPHEN A. DUZAN CHAIRMAN PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER SAID IT'S OBVIOUSLY QUITE A CHANGE FROM A YEAR AGO
c0zc0221 IT'S OUR THIRD YEAR OF CASH FLOW AND WE'VE BEEN PROFITABLE FOR THREE OUT OF THE LAST FOUR QUARTERS
c0zc0222 SO WE THINK IN GENERAL THAT THIS REPRESENTS A REAL HEALTHY KIND OF PICTURE FOR COMPANIES WHO PRODUCTS AREN'T YET APPROVED
c0zc0223 THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS FOUR OF ITS EXPERIMENTAL PRODUCTS IN HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS FOR DISEASES SUCH AS CANCER AND ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME
c0zc0224 MOREOVER THE COMPANIES SET UP AN INFORMAL ARBITRATION PROCESS THAT THEY SAY ENSURES THAT NOTHING WILL GO AHEAD UNTIL ALL NINE REACH A CONSENSUS
c0zc0225 MR. CANION ACKNOWLEDGES THE POSSIBILITY THAT A COMPANY COULD LIKE THE SOVIET UNION IN THE U. N. SECURITY COUNCIL HOLD UP SOMETHING SIMPLY BY SAYING NYET
c0zc0226 BUT HE SAYS NO ONE HAS INVOKED THAT PRIVILEGE THUS FAR
c0zc0227 CONGRESS HAS PROBABLY OUTGROWN MASSIVE HOUSING PROGRAMS BUT THE LEAST DANGEROUS BRANCH IS JUST FLEXING ITS MUSCLES IN A WAY ELECTED POLITICIANS NEVER WOULD
c0zc0228 THE COURTS HAVE PUT THE PEOPLE OF YONKERS UNDER A THREATENING CLOUD
c0zc0229 WHO'S NEXT
c0zc022a THE INDICTMENTS ALLEGE THAT MESSRS.
c0zc022b MARTINO AND ORLOFF APPROVED MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR WORK DONE LARGELY BY HANLEY WORLDWIDE
c0zc022c THEY RECEIVED PAYMENTS IN CASH AND IN THE FORM OF CLOTHES CLUB MEMBERSHIPS AND PAYMENT OF PERSONAL BILLS ACCORDING TO THE CHARGES
c0zc022d EVER SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO MR. GORBACHEV HAS SOUGHT TO INCREASE FOREIGN TRADE'S MEAGER SHARE OF THE SOVIET ECONOMY
c0zc022e RATHER THAN SIMPLY IMPORT MORE WESTERN GOODS HE WOULD LIKE TO OBTAIN THE MACHINERY AND KNOW HOW TO ENABLE THE SOVIETS TO MAKE THE GOODS THEMSELVES
c0zc022f TO DO SO HE OPENED UP THE ECONOMY TO FOREIGN CAPITAL AND EQUIPMENT BY PERMITTING JOINT VENTURES
c0zc022g HIGHER COMMISSIONS CAN ALSO REDUCE THE INVESTMENT VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES THAT INCLUDE A SAVINGS COMPONENT SUCH AS UNIVERSAL LIFE POLICIES
c0zc022h IN GENERAL POLICIES WITH HIGHER COMMISSIONS HAVE LOWER SURRENDER VALUES
c0zc022i THAT'S WHAT POLICYHOLDERS GET IF THEY CASH IN THE POLICY OR WHAT THEY CAN BORROW THROUGH POLICY LOANS
c10c0202 THERE ARE ALWAYS PROBLEMS WITH NEW PLANS HE SAID
c10c0203 THE B. ONE HOWEVER IS A VERY GOOD BOMBER
c10c0206 GASOLINE STATION SALES ROSE TWO PERCENT AFTER A ONE POINT NINE PERCENT INCREASE
c10c0207 SOME OF THAT INCREASE WAS PROBABLY BECAUSE OF HIGHER PRICES HOWEVER
c10c020a MR. MULFORD WELCOMED THESE AND OTHER RECENT JAPANESE FINANCIAL INITIATIVES
c10c020d TRUSTCORP SAID ITS PLAN TO COMPLETE THE PURCHASE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER
c10c020f TRUSTCORP INCORPORATED IS A HOLDING COMPANY WITH ASSETS OF FOUR POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS
c10c020g REGARDLESS OF WHAT POLITICAL LABEL THEY THINK IS APPROPRIATE ALMOST EVERYONE REGARDS GEORGE BUSH AS A DECENT HONEST AND LIKABLE PERSON
c10c020h AND MOST WOULD AGREE THAT HIS PERSONAL HISTORY HAS A STORYBOOK QUALITY ABOUT IT
c10c020i SOMEBODY ONCE SAID GEORGE BUSH HAS LED THE LIFE THAT RONALD REAGAN PORTRAYS SAYS PETE TEELEY A LONGTIME AIDE
c10c020j RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
c10c020k THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT
c10c020l THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
c10c020m DOCTORS ARE NERVOUS MS. ADAMS SAYS
c10c020o DOCTORS ARE TRAINED TO DEAL WITH DISEASE NOT HEALTH
c10c020r YOU HAVE TO EXPECT HIGHER REDEMPTIONS GIVEN ALL THE DIFFICULTY IN THE MARKET
c10c020s BUT IT WAS CONTAINED FAIRLY WELL
c10c020u WHY IS THE U. S. PARTICULARLY DEPENDENT ON NAVAL FORCES
c10c020v WHAT ARE THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF AMERICAN MILITARY PRACTICE AND POLICY
c10c020w THE RELEVANCE OF THESE ISSUES AND THEODORE ROOSEVELT'S EVENHANDED DISCUSSION OF THEM OBLIGE INTERESTED STUDENTS OF WAR TO READ THE BOOK AND HISTORIANS TO COPY IT
c10c020y FOLLOWING STRONG SHOWINGS IN RECENT PRIMARIES HE HAS NEARLY AS MANY DELEGATES AS GOVERNOR MICHAEL DUKAKIS OF MASSACHUSETTS THE FRONT RUNNER
c10c020z HIS PERFORMANCE SO FAR SUGGESTS SOME ABILITY TO REACH A LIBERAL CONSTITUTION BEYOND THE BLACK VOTE THAT PROVIDES THE BULK OF HIS SUPPORT
c10c0210 THIS SUCCESS SPRINGS FROM A COMBINATION OF PERSONALITY AND POPULISM
c10c0211 HE PREACHES BASIC VALUES AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE WORKERS IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE
c10c0212 STOP DRUGS FROM FLOWING IN AND STOP JOBS FROM FLOWING OUT
c10c0213 THE TEAM SAYS THIS KIND OF ACTION PROTECTS ITS VALUABLE PLAYERS FROM ABUSE
c10c0216 I TOLD JOEY TO GO OUT THERE AND TELL HIM NOT TO DO IT AGAIN SAYS THE COACH
c10c0217 THE MESSAGE GOT THROUGH IF NOT NECESSARILY IN WORDS
c10c0219 BUT HE SAYS JUST WAIT UNTIL WILLOW COMES OUT
c10c021a IT'S GOING TO KNOCK THE SOCKS OFF THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD
c10c021b IT'S BOFFO
c10c021d AND IMPORTS OF OIL AND AUTOS ARE EXPECTED TO BE LOWER FURTHER HELP ENLIGHTEN THE TRADE IMBALANCE
c10c021f THINGS ARE A BIT DULLER THIS YEAR
c10c021h ALL THE ACTION APPARENTLY WILL BE IN THE COURTROOM
c10c021i BUT MR. EDELL HAS ARGUED THAT MRS. CIPOLLONE HEARD CONFLICTING MESSAGES ABOUT THE HAZARDS OF HER HABIT
c10c021k THE CIGARETTE MAKERS' ADVERTISEMENTS REINFORCED THESE PERCEPTIONS AND OTHERS OF THE PRODUCT'S SAFETY THE PLAINTIFF CONTENDS
c10c021l CONISTON AMONG OTHER THINGS IS CALLING FOR A NEW VOTE
c10c021m IT ALSO ASKS FOR FINANCIAL COMPENSATION TO COVER COURT EXPENSES AND COSTS INCURRED DURING THE PROXY SOLICITATION
c10c021n A TRIAL ON THE SUIT HAS BEEN SCHEDULED FOR NEXT MONDAY
c10c021o THE STANDOFF CAST DOUBTS ABOUT HOW SINCERE JAPANESE COMPANIES ARE IN THEIR STATED WILLINGNESS TO BUY MORE U. S. MADE CHIPS
c10c021s HE HAS HELD THE POSITION THREE TIMES IN THE PAST AND WAS BELIEVED EAGER TO HEAD OPEC AGAIN
c10c021u THE FOLLOWING OFFICERS DIRECTORS AND LARGE STOCKHOLDERS OF COMPANIES REPORTED CHANGES IN HOLDINGS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR
c10c021v THOSE IDENTIFIED AS BENEFICIAL OWNERS HOLD AT LEAST TEN PERCENT OF A COMPANY'S EQUITY SECURITIES
c10c021w UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED CHANGES INVOLVED DIRECT HOLDINGS OF COMMON STOCK AND TOOK PLACE IN MAY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
c10c021x COMPANIES ARE LISTED WHERE TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY AGGREGATE TEN THOUSAND SHARES OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
c10c021z HE OBVIOUSLY RELISHES A GOOD FIGHT AND SAYING NO TO THE CULTURAL BARBARIANS AND THE CURRENT WISDOM
c10c0220 HE USES PIG BLADDER HAMMER AND TONGS AND SCALPEL AND HE IS ADEPT WITH THEM ALL AS THE ELECTRIC WINDMILL SHOWS
c10c0221 HELPED BY WEDNESDAY'S WALL STREET RALLY AND IMPROVED COMMODITY PRICES STOCK PRICES POSTED ROBUST GAINS IN SYDNEY
c10c0222 TURNOVER REMAINED THIN
c10c0223 AN EARLY SPURT OF DOMESTIC LED DEMAND DROVE PRICES TO THEIR BEST LEVELS DURING THE FIRST HOUR OF ACTIVITY
c10c0224 THEY DRIFTED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE SESSION AND CLOSED JUST SHORT OF THEIR PEAKS
c10c0226 IDEAS WERE FLOWING
c10c0227 WE WERE SEEING WHAT WORKED FOR EACH OF US
c10c0228 THE TWO OF US WERE TRYING TO THINK OF A WAY TO SATISFY EVERYONE
c10c0229 VIEWERS AND CRITICS SAY THE HUGE LOAD OF ADS AND AIRTIME IS PART OF THE PROBLEM
c10c022a COMMERCIAL CLUTTER SEEMS GREATER THAN IN PREVIOUS OLYMPICS BROADCASTS MANY CRITICS SAY
c10c022c ACTUAL EVENTS AS OPPOSED TO TAPED PROFILES PREVIEWS AND REPORTS TAKE UP LESS THAN HALF OF THE AIRTIME
c10c022d MANY HEADLINE EVENTS DON'T APPEAR UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT
c10c022f FINANCIAL HISTORY HAS WITNESSED A THOUSAND BOOMS AND BUSTS
c10c022g WITHIN RECENT MEMORY WE HAVE SEEN THE JUNK EQUITIES OF THE SIXTIES THE HEATED THIRD WORLD LEADING OF THE SEVENTIES AND THE THRIFT CRISIS OF THE EIGHTIES
c10c022i IF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS CRAZE AWAKEN NOW THE CORRECTION MAY STILL BE WITHIN TOLERABLE LIMITS FOR THE COUNTRY
c10c022j IF NOT ALL OF AMERICA WILL PAY THE PENALTY BECAUSE THE DEBT IS HUGE AND WIDELY HELD AND THE BANKING STRUCTURE'S INTEGRITY WOULD BE AT STAKE
c11c0201 BEFORE BEING HALTED ON THE TORONTO STOCK EXCHANGE MONDAY THE VOTING SHARES TRADED AT FORTY ONE DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS
c11c0202 THE SHARES RESUMED TRADING YESTERDAY
c11c0203 THE VOTING SHARES CLOSED AT SEVENTY DOLLARS UP TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS
c11c0204 THE CLASS A SHARES CLOSED AT FOURTEEN POINT THREE SEVEN FIVE DOLLARS UP SIXTY SEVEN POINT FIVE CENTS
c11c0205 NOW HE SELLS KNOCKOFF GUCCI AND ROLEX WATCHES STARTING AT FIFTY DOLLARS APIECE TO THE SECRETARIES AT HIS PREP SCHOOL
c11c0206 MY STRATEGY IS TO GET THEM ALONE HE EXPLAINS
c11c0207 THEN LATER THEY CAN SHOW OFF THEIR WATCHES AND BRAG ABOUT THEIR GENEROUS HUSBANDS
c11c0208 THE ISSUE IS SO SENSITIVE HERE SAYS BOND ANALYST DANIEL SCOTTO OF L. F. ROTHSCHILD UNTERBERG AND TOWBIN
c11c0209 WE ARE ALL CONCERNED THAT THE REGULATORS CAN SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR CREDIT TO CARRY THE COMPANY OUT INTO THE HORIZON
c11c020a BUT HE ADDED THE BANKERS ARE WAITING FOR COMMITMENTS FROM THE REGULATORS AND THE REGULATORS ARE WAITING FOR COMMITMENTS FROM THE BANKERS
c11c020b THE ACCORD MOST LIKELY WOULD INCLUDE SOME PRIVATE AGREEMENT AMONG MINISTERS ON HOW FAR UP OR DOWN THESE RATES CAN MOVE AND STILL BE ACCEPTABLE
c11c020c BUT OFFICIALS SAID IT IS UNLIKELY THESE LIMITS WOULD BE MADE PUBLIC
c11c020d AND IT ISN'T KNOWN YET WHETHER THE MAJOR POWERS WOULD PLEDGE TO INTERVENE IN CURRENCY MARKETS IF EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO EXCEED THOSE LIMITS
c11c020e THE REMAINING OFFSETTING COLLECTIONS OF MORE THAN THREE BILLION DOLLARS COME FROM USER FEES WHICH ALSO CLEARLY ARE NOT TAXES
c11c020f A USER FEE IS A SPECIFIC CHARGE FOR A DIRECT BENEFIT RECEIVED
c11c020g LIKE AN ASSET SALE BUT UNLIKE A TAX A USER FEE DOES NOT INVOLVE COMPULSION
c11c020h ONE CHARACTERISTIC OF USER FEES IS THAT THEY REVEAL HOW MUCH GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ARE REALLY WORTH TO DIRECT RECIPIENTS IN THE MOST DIRECT AND MEANINGFUL WAY POSSIBLE
c11c020i ONE OF THE STRONGEST ARGUMENTS THAT A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM IS WORTHWHILE OCCURS WHEN IT HAS A USER FEE AND THE FEE COVERS COSTS
c11c020j THE REVERSE IS ALSO TRUE AND THAT IS ONE REASON SOME BENEFICIARIES OPPOSE USER FEES
c11c020k ALLIED WHICH WAS ACQUIRED LAST YEAR FOR THREE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN A HOSTILE TAKEOVER BID BY CAMPEAU CORPORATION HAS TWENTY FOUR DIVISIONS
c11c020l BLOCK'S IS ONE OF SIXTEEN DIVISIONS THAT CAMPEAU MUST SELL TO COMPLY WITH ITS BANK AGREEMENTS
c11c020m BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR THE TORONTO BASED REAL ESTATE CONCERN MUST MEET A ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR BANK OBLIGATION
c11c020n CONSEQUENTLY LLOYD'S AND SOME BROKERS MAY BE FORCED TO INCREASE THEIR SHARE OF THE SETTLEMENT PAYMENT

c12c020w MANY AGREE THERE IS LITTLE TIME TO WASTE IN THE SCRAMBLE TO CREATE BETTER INTERNATIONAL REGULATION
c12c020x AS MR. FELDSTEIN SAYS YOU CAN'T JUST LOOK AT THE BUILDING AND SAY IT HASN'T FALLEN DOWN YET SO WE SHOULD BE SAFE

c12c021r ALL THREE METALS TRADED HIGHER AT VARIOUS POINTS IN THE DAY BUT LATE PROFIT TAKING TRIMMED THE ADVANCES
c12c021s SO FAR THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IGNORED THESE APPEALS AND SO HAVE MR. REED AND OTHER BANKERS
c12c021t IT SEEMS THAT THE PRINCIPLES ENUNCIATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DECADE BY MESSRS.
c12c021u WRISTON AND THEOBALD STILL PREVAIL IF NOT IN LENDING THE BANK'S MONEY AT LEAST IN SUGGESTING THAT OTHER INVESTORS PUT UP THE CASH

c13c020t THE FOUR TO ZERO DECISION IS A SECOND VICTORY FOR BROADCASTERS PROMOTING A NEW TECHNOLOGY CALLED HIGH DEFINITION TELEVISION
c13c020u THOSE BROADCASTERS HAVE ARGUED THAT THEY WILL NEED ADDITIONAL TELEVISION FREQUENCIES TO TRANSMIT HIGH DEFINITION PICTURES
c13c020v BUT MOBILE RADIO COMPANIES HAVE URGED THE F. C. C. TO REALLOCATE THE FREQUENCIES FOR SUCH USES AS POLICE OR FIRE DEPARTMENT RADIO
c13c020w BUT THE ORDER ALMOST IMMEDIATELY GENERATED INTENSE CONTROVERSY BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE CABINET

c13c020z REPRESENTATIVE FOLEY SAID THERE WAS GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT A DEFICIT REDUCTION PACKAGE SHOULD CONSIST HALF OF SPENDING CUTS AND HALF REVENUE RAISING MEASURES

c13c0213 THE JURY'S STILL OUT ON WHETHER THESE TECHNIQUES WILL PROVE USEFUL SAYS JOHN N. BELL WHO MANAGES THE FUND
c13c0214 BUT THEY'RE PROMISING ENOUGH THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO GIVE THEM A PORTION OF THEIR ASSETS
c13c0215 THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR THE NEW STRENGTH IN THE SWEDISH ECONOMY
c13c0216 SOME OF THEM CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE ECONOMIC POLICIES PURSUED BY OUR GOVERNMENT WHICH IS LED BY THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY
c13c0217 SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS ARE DUE TO THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY AND THE HALVING OF OIL PRICES
c13c0218 THE IMPROVEMENT HAS GIVEN SWEDISH POLITICIANS TIME TO CONSIDER WHAT CHANGES ARE NEEDED IN A LONGER PERSPECTIVE TO ENSURE A CONTINUATION OF A FAVORABLE ECONOMIC SITUATION
c13c0219 MOST OF BOZELL'S REVLON RELATED REVENUE LAST YEAR CAME FROM MEDIA PLACEMENTS
c13c021a BOZELL IS SAID TO HAVE PLACED ABOUT FORTY MILLION DOLLARS OF ADS FOR REVLON LAST YEAR
c13c021b TYPICALLY FEES FOR SUCH PLACEMENTS ARE ABOUT ONE PERCENT
c13c021c GRAINS AND SOYBEANS THE THREAT OF RAIN AND FAVORABLE SPRING PLANTING CONDITIONS PUSHED SOYBEAN AND CORN FUTURES PRICES LOWER
c13c021d THE LATEST WEATHER FORECAST CALLS FOR FAIRLY GOOD MOISTURE IN MIDWEST FARMING STATES OVER THE NEXT SIX TO TEN DAYS
c13c021e ANALYSTS SAID TRADERS ARE SHIFTING THEIR EMPHASIS AWAY FROM LAST YEAR'S CROP AND TO THIS YEAR'S
c13c021f WITH THIS YEAR'S SMALL ACREAGE INCREASES WEATHER AND SPRING PLANTING CONDITIONS ARE MAJOR CONCERNS TO A MARKET THAT IS BEGINNING TO SHAKE OFF A HUGE SURPLUS
c13c021g THE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS HELPED THE SOYBEAN CONTRACT FOR NOVEMBER SETTLEMENT CLOSE AT SIX POINT EIGHT TWO TWO FIVE DOLLARS A BUSHEL DOWN NINE POINT FIVE CENTS
c13c021h SOME WONDER WHETHER ALL THE CONVERSIONS DON'T MAKE MR. BEREGOVOY MORE OF AN OPPORTUNIST THAN A BELIEVER IN THE MARKET ECONOMY

c13c021z THE PHILIPPINES IS OF COURSE A TOUGH COUNTRY TO GOVERN
c13c0220 IT REFLECTS CREDIT ON MRS. AQUINO THAT SHE HAS STUCK TO HER DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES THROUGH FIVE COUP ATTEMPTS AS WELL AS NONSTOP POLITICAL DOGFIGHTS
c13c0221 MRS. AQUINO UNDERSTANDS CORRECTLY THAT AS THE ELECTED PRESIDENT SHE IS ABOVE SUCH NONSENSE
c13c0222 HER RESPONSIBILITY IS TO THE VOTERS WHO RECOGNIZED THE NATION'S DESPERATE NEED FOR REFORM AND GAVE HER THEIR MANDATE
c13c0223 TO AVOID MORE OUTBURSTS SUCH AS MR. LAUREL'S IT'S TIME THAT MRS. AQUINO STARTED USING THAT MANDATE

c14c020a L. T. C. B. INTERNATIONAL LIMITED MANAGED THE ISSUE
c14c020b BY AND LARGE OPEC IS PREPARED TO SIT IT OUT SAID A SENIOR OPEC MINISTER WHO ASKED NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED
c14c020c THERE MAY BE SOME WEAKER MEMBERS AMONG US BUT OPEC AS A WHOLE ISN'T OVERPRODUCING
c14c020d THE PROBLEM IS SPECULATION BY TRADERS THAT VERGES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE
c14c020e BUT JOHN SMALE P. AND G.'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE USED THE MEETING TO SPEAK AT LENGTH ABOUT HOSTILE TAKEOVERS IN GENERAL
c14c020f HE MAINTAINED THAT TOO OFTEN THEY LEAVE COMPANIES LOADED WITH DEBT AND SHRUNKEN RESEARCH BUDGETS AND IGNORE THE INTERESTS OF EMPLOYEES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THE COMPANIES DO BUSINESS
c14c020h FOR THE WALL STREET FIRMS THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS COULD COME MONDAY WHEN SHARES AND CASH OF LAST MONDAY'S TRADES ARE ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO CHANGE HANDS
c14c020j BOTH THE BIG BOARD AND AMEX SAID THAT THEY ARE CONSIDERING CALLING PEOPLE INTO WORK SATURDAY TO HELP PROCESS THIS WEEK'S ACTIVITY
c14c020l BUT THE BUNDESBANK HE ASSERTS HAS TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS IN SETTING ITS MONETARY POLICY
c14c020m FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW WE ALREADY HAVE A PERMISSIVE POLICY HE SAYS
c14c020n DEALERS SAID ACTIVITY WAS SLOW BECAUSE OF THE U. S. HOLIDAY CELEBRATING THE BIRTHDAY OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR
c14c020o MOST U. S. BANKS WERE CLOSED ALTHOUGH SEVERAL OF THE LARGER FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPARTMENTS REMAINED OPEN TO SERVICE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS AND TRADE WITH EUROPE
c14c020p BUT EVEN THEY WOUND DOWN THEIR TRADING WHEN THE LONDON MARKET SHUT DOWN AROUND NOON E. S. T. OR AFTER THE CHICAGO FUTURES MARKET CLOSED LATER IN THE AFTERNOON
c14c020q MR. THAYER SAID MR. YOUNG RECEIVED A LUMP SUM PAYMENT TO SETTLE HIS CONTRACT WITH GIBRALTAR FINANCIAL BUT WOULDN'T DISCLOSE THE AMOUNT
c14c020r MR. YOUNG'S CONTRACT WHICH RAN UNTIL JANUARY TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN NINETY ONE CALLED FOR A SALARY OF AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
c14c020s IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX MR. YOUNG WAS PAID FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY SIX DOLLARS
c14c020t THE JANUARY INCREASE FOLLOWED A REVISED DECEMBER EXPANSION OF THREE POINT NINE EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AS FOUR POINT FOUR FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
c14c020u AUTO LOANS OUTSTANDING INCREASED ONE POINT FIVE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN JANUARY AFTER AN INCREASE OF TWO POINT THREE TWO BILLION DOLLARS THE PREVIOUS MONTH
c14c020v POINTING TO THE STRONG CAR SALES REPORTED FOR LATE FEBRUARY SEVERAL ECONOMISTS SUGGESTED THE MEASURE WILL AGAIN SHOW AN INCREASE IN THE REPORT RELEASED NEXT MONTH
c14c020x WHY DID PRESIDENT REAGAN SIGN THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION WITHOUT READING IT
c14c020y WHY DID THE F. C. C. THEN GO TO COURT TO DEFEND THE KENNEDY PROVISION WHEN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH KNEW IT WAS OUTRAGEOUS
c14c020z IN OTHER WORDS WHY DID IT FALL TO THE COURTS TO PROTECT THE PREROGATIVES OF THE PRESIDENCY
c14c0210 THE SUIT WAS FILED LAST MONTH ONLY TWO DAYS AFTER A SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE HEARING ON DUAL STOCK CLASSES HELD BY SENATORS
c14c0211 RICHARD C. SHELBY D. ALABAMA AND WILLIAM ARMSTRONG R. COLORADO OPPONENTS OF THE TWO TIER STOCKS
c14c0212 COMMITTEE STAFFERS SAY THE TWO MAY BE LAYING THE GROUNDWORK TO AMEND PENDING LEGISLATION TO OUTLAW DUAL STOCK CLASSES
c14c0213 FOR GILLETTE SHAREHOLDERS THE FIGHT REPRESENTS A CLASSIC CASE OF SHORT TERM VERSUS LONG TERM INTERESTS
c14c0214 A VOTE FOR CONISTON PROBABLY MEANS A TAKEOVER OR RECONSTRUCTING AND A QUICK PROFIT
c14c0216 THE ENTREPRENEURIAL UNITS USUALLY STRUGGLE TO KEEP A COMFORTABLE DISTANCE FROM THE PARENT COMPANY
c14c0217 BUT THERE CAN BE BENEFITS FROM DRAWING ON A WELL KNOWN CORPORATE NAME
c14c0218 WHEN WE CALL ON RETAILERS AND TRY TO GET A NEW PRODUCT ON THE SHELF WE DO LEVERAGE OUR ASSOCIATION WITH COLGATE MR. SPELLING SAYS
c14c0219 THE COMPANY SAID LIFE INSURANCE AND PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS HAD RECORD FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
c14c021a IT SAID THAT FINANCE UNIT EARNINGS ROSE FORTY ONE PERCENT AND THAT ITS LEASING UNIT HAD RECORD RESULTS BECAUSE OF HIGH UTILIZATION RATES
c14c021b CONSUMER LENDING ALONG WITH TAX AND TITLE OPERATIONS DECLINED REFLECTING LAGGING BUT NOW IMPROVING REAL ESTATE SALES THE COMPANY SAID
c14c021c THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFICIAL ARMED FORCES MAGAZINES TRADITIONALLY HAVE BEEN OFF LIMITS TO ALL ADVERTISERS
c14c021d BUT RECENTLY THE ARMY AND NAVY STARTED CONSIDERING FARMING THEIRS OUT TO COMMERCIAL PUBLISHERS WHO WOULD ACCEPT ADS
c14c021e WE'RE EXPLORING IT TO SEE HOW MUCH MONEY WE COULD SAVE ON OUR SOLDIERS MAGAZINE AN ARMY SPOKESMAN SAYS
c14c021f THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT INVITES FOREIGN NEWSPAPERS TO PRINT THE TRUTH ABOUT SINGAPORE
c14c021i SHULTZ SAID TALKS INTENDED TO INDUCE THE MILITARY LEADER TO LEAVE PANAMA HAD COLLAPSED BECAUSE NORIEGA WOULDN'T CARRY THROUGH WITH THE OFFER WORKED OUT BY HIS NEGOTIATORS
c14c021j THE SECRETARY OF STATE SAID THAT FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WEREN'T PLANNED AND THAT NO OFFERS REMAIN ON THE TABLE
c14c021k UNDER THE DEAL THE U. S. OFFERED TO DROP DRUG CHARGES AGAINST NORIEGA IN RETURN FOR HIS DEPARTURE
c14c021l SHULTZ SAID THE U. S. WOULD WORK THROUGH OTHER COUNTRIES TO GET NORIEGA OUT OF POWER
c14c021m A LEBANESE NEWSPAPER PREDICTED THAT FOUR COLLEGE TEACHERS THREE AMERICANS AND AN INDIAN RESIDENT OF THE U. S. WOULD BE FREED SOON
c14c021n THE FOUR HAVE BEEN HELD HOSTAGE SINCE JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND ARE BELIEVED TO BE IN BEIRUT'S SOUTHERN SLUMS
c14c021o SYRIA HAS SENT ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SOLDIERS TO THE AREA TO END FIGHTING BETWEEN RIVAL SHIITE MILITIAS
c14c021s MR. REAGAN HIMSELF WHEN HE GOT IN OFFICE PUT ITS ISSUES ON THE BACK BURNER
c14c021u ONE BAG EQUALS SIXTY KILOS
c14c021y ANOTHER CAMP HOPES FOR A TAKEOVER OR LEVERAGED BUYOUT THOUGH THE ERIE PENNSYLVANIA COMPANY SAYS IT DOESN'T KNOW OF ANY SUCH THING IN THE WORKS
c14c021z MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE UNCERTAIN WHETHER A DUKAKIS ADMINISTRATION WOULD IMPOSE A BAN ON SOME OF THE METALS HE SAYS
c14c0220 IT IS ALSO FEASIBLE THAT THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT WOULD RETALIATE SELECTIVELY HE SAYS
c14c0221 IT COULD REDUCE SUPPLIES OF VITAL METALS THAT ACCOUNT FOR ONLY A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE NATION'S EXPORTS MR. PRAGER SAYS
c14c0222 HOWEVER HE LEAVES PRIME AT A DIFFICULT TIME
c14c0223 THE COMPUTER MARKET IS GROWING SLOWLY AND PRIME'S PROPRIETARY SYSTEMS ARE LOSING GROUND TO INDUSTRY STANDARD COMPUTERS THAT USE THE UNIX OPERATING SYSTEM
c14c0224 AND SOME WALL STREET ANALYSTS THINK PRIME SHOULD HAVE CUT COSTS MORE RAPIDLY IN THE WAKE OF THE COMPUTERVISION ACQUISITION
c14c0226 MARKETERS SAY IT WAS SO BLAND AND SKIPPED SO FREQUENTLY FROM ONE EVENT TO ANOTHER THAT THERE WAS LITTLE CHANCE FOR EXCITEMENT TO BUILD
c14c0227 THE CONSTANT COMMERCIAL INTERRUPTIONS WHICH LED TO RATINGS THAT WERE MUCH LOWER THAN EXPECTED DIDN'T HELP EITHER
c14c0228 NONE OF THIS MEANS JAPANESE INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT WILL BE TRANSFORMED OVERNIGHT
c14c0229 CHANGE WILL COME SLOWLY BECAUSE JAPANESE SOCIETY STILL HAS A STRONG TENDENCY TO HAMMER DOWN ANY NAIL THAT STICKS UP
c14c022b THERE MAY BE SCADS OF MONEY IN JAPAN BUT THERE IS PRECIOUS LITTLE VENTURE CAPITAL
c14c022c THERE ARE STILL LEGISLATIVE ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND AMONG FOUR HOUSE COMMITTEES BEFORE THE BILL REACHES THE HOUSE FLOOR
c14c022d BUSINESS GROUPS FOR EXAMPLE ARE UNHAPPY AT PROVISIONS REQUIRING BUS COMPANIES TO INSTALL WHEELCHAIR LIFTS AND HANDICAPPED TOILETS IN NEW OVER THE ROAD BUSES
c14c022h THAT SURPASSED THE ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR NET INFLOW IN JUNE AND MARKED A TURNAROUND FROM A THREE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLAR OUTFLOW IN JULY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
c14c022i SEVERAL MUTUAL FUND FIRMS MOREOVER SAY STOCK FUND INFLOWS HAVE SWOLLEN FURTHER THIS MONTH
c15c0201 NOW HE SELLS KNOCKOFF GUCCI AND ROLEX WATCHES STARTING AT FIFTY DOLLARS APIECE TO THE SECRETARIES AT HIS PREP SCHOOL
c15c0202 MY STRATEGY IS TO GET THEM ALONE HE EXPLAINS
c15c0203 THEN LATER THEY CAN SHOW OFF THEIR WATCHES AND BRAG ABOUT THEIR GENEROUS HUSBANDS
c15c0204 MR. HENKEL WAS NOMINATED FRIDAY TO FILL A VACANCY FOR A TERM EXPIRING JUNE THIRTIETH NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
c15c0205 MR. WHITE'S NAME WAS SENT TO THE SENATE TO FILL A VACANCY FOR A TERM EXPIRING JUNE THIRTIETH NINETEEN NINETY
c15c0206 CONFIRMATION HEARINGS FOR THE TWO MEN HAVEN'T BEEN SCHEDULED YET
c15c0207 FAIRFAX COUNTY SAYS ONE OFFICIAL HAS BECOME TOO EXPENSIVE FOR MANY OF ITS BUTCHERS BAKERS AND CANDLESTICK MAKERS
c15c0208 THE COUNTY OFFICE HAS HAD TROUBLE RECENTLY HANGING ON TO A RECEPTIONIST
c15c0209 THREE OF THE LAST FOUR RECEPTIONISTS SAID THE MONEY WASN'T WORTH THEIR LONG COMMUTES
c15c020a IN MANY OF THESE NEW PLACES THE SIGNS IN FRONT OF THE FAST FOOD OUTLETS ADVERTISE JOBS AS OFTEN AS BURGERS
c15c020b ONE ADVANTAGE OF INVESTING IN MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES AND JUNK BONDS IS RELATIVELY LOW OVERHEAD COSTS
c15c020c AT FRANKLIN FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT HALF A DOZEN PEOPLE HANDLE THE PAPERWORK ASSOCIATED WITH MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT OF THE THRIFT'S ASSETS
c15c020d DOZENS OF EMPLOYEES ARE NEEDED TO PROCESS THE PAPERWORK FOR THE THRIFT'S TINY MORTGAGE LOAN PORTFOLIO AND ITS RETAIL DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS
c15c020e ANY GOVERNMENT BAILOUT POSES SEVERAL RISKS
c15c020f ONE IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION MAY UPSET THE INDUSTRY'S COMPETITIVE BALANCE
c15c020g WHILE BIG UNIONIZED STEELMAKERS ARE STUMBLING MINIMILLS SMALL PLANTS THAT MAKE STEEL FROM SCRAP INSTEAD OF IRON ORE ARE FLOURISHING
c15c020h BY RESCUING THE BIG STEELMAKERS SOME ECONOMISTS SAY THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD IMPLICITLY SAY IT'S WRONG FOR MARKET FORCES TO WORK
c15c020i WHAT THIS SHOW REALLY IS THEN IS AN HOMAGE TO THE LATE SPANISH MASTER
c15c020j IF ONE ACCEPTS THE SHOW ON THAT BASIS IT IS SUCCESSFUL DESPITE ITS GAPS
c15c020k IN FACT THE GREATER WEIGHT GIVEN MIRO'S EARLIER PAINTINGS WORKS TO ADVANTAGE HERE FOR MANY OF HIS BEST PICTURES WERE DONE BEFORE THE MID NINETEEN THIRTIES
c15c020l AFTER THAT HIS WORK WAS SOMEWHAT UNEVEN
c15c020m THERE IS NO DENYING THAT A PROGRAM OF ROUTINE TESTING AND CONTACT NOTIFICATION PRESENTS SOME CHALLENGES
c15c020n FEW DECISIONS ON AIDS ARE EASY
c15c020o BUT THE DIFFICULTY OF THE TASK CANNOT DISCOURAGE US FROM FACING UP TO OUR RESPONSIBILITIES
c15c020p FOR WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE
c15c020q TO GO ON AS WE HAVE BEEN
c15c020r WE CANNOT DO THAT
c15c020s TO THESE ENDS K. P. C. ENJOYS A HUGE ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE
c15c020t IT COSTS KUWAIT ABOUT A DOLLAR TO PUMP A BARREL OF OIL AND ANOTHER FIFTY CENTS TO BRING IT TO EUROPE
c15c020u THE PRODUCTION COST OF NORTH SEA OIL BY CONTRAST RUNS BETWEEN EIGHT DOLLARS AND THIRTEEN DOLLARS A BARREL
c15c020v THE BIG DIFFERENCE DISTURBS EUROPEAN OIL MEN
c15c020w AT MOST HIGHFLYING TEXAS THRIFTS A FRIEND OF THE BOSS COULD GET MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON A SIGNATURE
c15c020x LOANS COULD EXCEED THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE LAND THANKS TO SOME LIBERAL TEXAS S. AND L. LAWS AND COOPERATIVE APPRAISERS
c15c020y DOWN PAYMENTS WERE CONSIDERED AN UNNECESSARY FORMALITY AND NOBODY SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED CHASING AFTER A BORROWER WHO DIDN'T PAY
c15c020z INDEED HE SEES A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN THE WORLD'S USE OF RESOURCES
c15c0210 WE ARE BEING FAR MORE SKILLFUL IN THE USE OF MATERIAL
c15c0211 CONSUMPTION IS ON THE INCREASE BUT AT A MUCH LOWER RATE
c15c0212 EVEN AT FIFTEEN THOUSAND TO ONE OF COURSE THE HOLE IN ONE IS A STATISTICALLY STUPENDOUS FEAT
c15c0213 A PERSON WHO PLAYS GOLF TWENTY FIVE TIMES A YEAR ON FULL SIZED COURSES WILL TAKE ONE HUNDRED TEE SHOTS ON PAR THREE HOLES
c15c0214 AT THAT RATE HE'LL SINK ONE ACE EVERY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS
c15c0215 MR. ZINN SAID ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING IS STILL WEIGHING A PROXY FIGHT
c15c0216 IT'S A BAD FEELING IN YOUR STOMACH WHEN THE CHAIRMAN AND PREVIOUS BIDDER IS SELLING HIS BLOCK HE SAID
c15c0217 IT DOESN'T MAKE ME AS A SHAREHOLDER COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE COMPANY
c15c0219 RESEARCH SHOWS THAT MANY CONSUMERS THINK ITALIAN FOOD HAS TOO MUCH BASIL AND GARLIC SO SUCH INGREDIENTS ARE USED SPARINGLY
c15c021a OLD WORLD CREATIVITY IN THE KITCHEN GIVES WAY TO LASER BEAM PRECISION LOCAL CHEFS AREN'T ALLOWED TO IMPULSIVELY ADD A DASH OF ANYTHING
c15c021b DINERS AREN'T LIKELY TO CONSIDER THEIR MEALS MEMORABLE THE COMPANY CONCEDES
c15c021c BUT AT LEAST THEY WON'T BE ASKING WHAT'S THIS WEIRD TASTING STUFF SAYS MR. THOMPSON
c15c021d RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
c15c021e THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT
c15c021f THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
c15c021g AT SCHWAB THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT CAPITAL BUDGET IS ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT LESS THAN THE AMOUNT BEING SPENT THIS YEAR ACCORDING TO LAWRENCE STUPSKI SCHWAB'S PRESIDENT
c15c021h BEFORE THE CRASH SCHWAB EXPECTED TO OPEN THIRTY NEW OFFICES IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS
c15c021i BUT MR. STUPSKI SAID THAT NUMBER HAS BEEN CUT ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT BECAUSE OF THE OUTLOOK FOR LOWER VOLUMES
c15c021j THE FIRST WAVE OF LAYOFFS BEGAN MONDAY WHEN ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EMPLOYEES WERE LAID OFF AT THE FIRM'S DATA PROCESSING CENTER IN SOMERSET N. J.
c15c021k THE CENTER EMPLOYS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE
c15c021l ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES WERE LAID OFF YESTERDAY AT MERRILL'S HEADQUARTERS BUILDING
c15c021m THE CUTS INVOLVED THE SECURITIES RESEARCH AND ECONOMICS DEPARTMENTS AND ONE OF THE FIRM'S LIBRARIES WHICH WAS CLOSED OFFICIALS SAID
c15c021n THE ACADEMY'S FEARS ABOUT SOLICITING VOTES HOWEVER MAY BE EXAGGERATED
c15c021o SAYS BOOKER MCCLAY A PUBLICIST WHO SPECIALIZES IN PROMOTING MOVIES FOR OSCARS YOU CAN'T BUY THE VOTERS
c15c021p THEY'RE VERY INDEPENDENT AND VERY JADED
c15c021q ACADEMY MEMBERS HAVE SEEN THOUSANDS OF PICTURES HE ADDS AND YOU CAN'T HUSTLE THEM
c15c021r PRINCIPALS OF A. W. A NEWLY FORMED CORPORATION INCLUDE ARTHUR G. HAILAND FORMER CHAIRMAN OF AIR WIS WHO WAS REMOVED FROM THAT JOB AFTER THE PREVIOUS OFFER
c15c021s HE REMAINS A DIRECTOR
c15c021t AIR WIS IS THE HOLDING COMPANY FOR AIR WISCONSIN AN APPLETON WISCONSIN BASED COMMUTER AIRLINE
c15c021u AS FOR THE STICKERS FEW FORD DRIVERS EVEN APPLIED THEM
c15c021v ONLY ABOUT SEVEN PERCENT DID ACCORDING TO A SPOT CHECK BY THE CENTER FOR AUTO SAFETY
c15c021w AND FORD NEVER REACHED MORE THAN TWO MILLION OWNERS AT ALL
c15c021x FOR GILLETTE SHAREHOLDERS THE FIGHT REPRESENTS A CLASSIC CASE OF SHORT TERM VERSUS LONG TERM INTERESTS
c15c021y A VOTE FOR CONISTON PROBABLY MEANS A TAKEOVER OR RESTRUCTURING AND A QUICK PROFIT
c15c021z A GILLETTE VICTORY ALMOST CERTAINLY WOULD SEND THE COMPANY'S STOCK PLUNGING POSSIBLY TO AS LOW AS THIRTY DOLLARS ANALYSTS PREDICT
c15c0220 THE OFFER IS A BRILLIANT DEFENSE CONTRIVED BY SANTA FE'S INVESTMENT BANKERS AT SALOMON BROTHERS AND GOLDMAN SACHS
c15c0221 THE SIXTY THREE DOLLAR A SHARE PRICE WILL HANG OVER THE NEGOTIATIONS LIKE SMOG OVER LOS ANGELES
c15c0222 AND THOUGH MR. DINGMAN WILL OFFER PACKAGE AFTER PACKAGE THAT SEEMS TO ADD UP TO SIXTY THREE DOLLARS HE DOESN'T REALLY PLAN TO MEET THE ASKING PRICE
c15c0223 INSTEAD HE HOPES TO PERSUADE SANTA FE TO TAKE LESS
c15c0224 NOR IS THE NUMBER SEVENTEEN A MAGIC NUMBER STRESSED DOCTOR SHAW
c15c0225 IF WE HAD TWO HUNDRED FIFTY COPIES WE MIGHT HAVE FOUND ONE HUNDRED DIFFERENT VIRUSES HE SAID
c15c0226 HE TERMED THE SPEED OF MUTATION EXTRAORDINARY AND COMPARED THE AIDS VIRUS WITH OTHER SWIFTLY CHANGING VIRUSES SUCH AS INFLUENZA
c15c0227 AS JAPAN'S FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE GROWN AND BECOME MORE INTERNATIONAL SO HAS FOREIGN PRESSURE ON JAPAN TO CLEAN UP WHAT MANY PERCEIVE AS UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES
c15c0228 AS A START JAPAN REVISED ITS SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE LAW LAST MAY
c15c0229 NOW THE FINANCE MINISTRY IS WRITING THE DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES THAT WILL GIVE THE NEW LAW MUSCLE WHEN IT GOES INTO EFFECT NEXT APRIL
c15c022a AND JOURNALISTS SECURITIES ANALYSTS AND SOME CORPORATE OFFICIALS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE MINISTRY'S FIRST DRAFT
c15c022b THIS PLAN DUBBED THE MIYAZAWA PLAN IN HONOR OF JAPANESE FINANCE MINISTER KIICHI MIYAZAWA SOUNDS JOLLY ON THE SURFACE
c15c022c BANKS WOULD HAVE A NEW MARKET AT THE I. M. F. WHERE THEY COULD PEDDLE UNWANTED DEBTOR NATION PAPER
c15c022d THE DEBTOR NATIONS WOULD HAVE A NEW SOURCE OF FINANCING OF SORTS
c15c022e THEY COULD RESCHEDULE A PORTION OF THEIR DEBTS WITH A POSSIBILITY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OF REPAYING SOME IN THEIR OWN CURRENCIES
c15c022f THE I. M. F. WOULD HAVE A MORE CENTRAL ROLE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL DEBT
c15c022g AND THE JAPANESE WOULD BECOME CLOSE PARTNERS OF THE I. M. F. IN DEBT MANAGEMENT
c15c022h STEEL ISSUES STAYED FIRM
c15c022i NIPPON STEEL MADE SUBSTANTIAL GAINS BROKERS SAID CLOSING AT EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY YEN UP ELEVEN
c15c022j KAWASAKI STEEL CLOSED FLAT AT NINE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR YEN
c16c0201 IN ADDITION TO THE WAR OF NERVES OVER DISCOUNTS RETAIL EXECUTIVES SAID THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY THE ABSENCE OF A BIG HIT IN THE TOY DEPARTMENT
c16c0202 BUT RETAILERS HAVE SEEN STRONG SALES OF BIG TICKET ITEMS TO WELL HEELED CUSTOMERS
c16c0203 THEY ARE BUYING TO BEAT THE NEW TAX LAW WHICH WILL END THE DEDUCTION OF SALES TAXES AND SOME INTEREST EXPENSES
c16c0204 AFTER U. S. WARPLANES STRUCK LIBYA LAST APRIL RICHARD ROBINSON DROPPED PLANS FOR A TWO WEEK VACATION IN FRANCE AND IRELAND FEARING AN INCREASE IN TERRORISM
c16c0205 NOW MR. ROBINSON A DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED STOCKBROKER IN BOCA RATON FLORIDA PLANS TO VISIT WEST GERMANY THIS JUNE
c16c0206 BUT IF THEY START THE TERRORISM AGAIN I'LL HAVE TO RECONSIDER HE SAYS
c16c0207 LENDERS AGREE THAT V. A. SHOULD TURN THE PROPERTY OVER TO THEM WHEN FRAUD OR FAULTY UNDERWRITING IS INVOLVED
c16c0208 BUT AS MR. FRENCH ARGUES MANY MORTGAGE DEFAULTS ARE THE PRODUCT OF DEPRESSION IN THE ENERGY PRODUCING STATES NOT NEGLIGENCE
c16c0209 SOME OF THESE LOANS WERE PERFECTLY UNDERWRITTEN BUT THE ECONOMY HAS GONE BAD IN THESE COMMUNITIES HE SAYS
c16c020a SHOULD THE MORTGAGE BANKER BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT
c16c020b THE LOSER IN THIS ISN'T JUST THE MORTGAGE BANKER BUT ALSO THE VETERAN WHO IS LOSING A BENEFIT
c16c020c IF CHARGES ARE MADE WEST GERMANY'S NATIONAL CENTRAL BANK THE BUNDESBANK COULD LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION OF PARKING THAT WOULD INCLUDE A MAJOR REVIEW OF BANKS' BOOKS
c16c020d THAT WOULD OPEN A WHOLE NEW ASPECT TO THE V. W. CASE ANALYSTS AND BANKERS SAY
c16c020e THE BUNDESBANK IS ALREADY HELPING STATE ATTORNEYS AND THE FEDERAL CRIMINAL BUREAU IN THEIR INVESTIGATION OF V. W.
c16c020f IN TAMPA A JIM WALTER SPOKESMAN WOULDN'T DISCUSS THE MATTER
c16c020g PEOPLE CAN SAY WHAT THEY WANT BUT WE WON'T COMMENT HE SAID
c16c020h MR. WALTER HIMSELF AND OTHER TOP EXECUTIVES DIDN'T RETURN PHONE CALLS
c16c020i IN MORE INNOCENT TIMES THE LEGAL PROFESSION WAS AN EXCLUSIVE CLUB THAT LOOKED AFTER ITS OWN
c16c020j SQUABBLES WERE SETTLED BEHIND THE COURTHOUSE
c16c020k LAWYERLY MISDEEDS WERE HUSHED UP OR HURRIEDLY RESOLVED
c16c020l CLIENTS WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT SCANDALOUS TO SUE THE FAMILY OR COMPANY LAWYER
c16c020m SUSPICIOUS MERRILL LYNCH CALLED IRWIN L. JACOBS THE MINNEAPOLIS INVESTOR WHOSE VENTURES INCLUDED MINSTAR
c16c020n MR. JACOBS TOLD THE BROKERAGE THAT THE ORDER WAS A FAKE AND DISMISSED IT AS A PRANK
c16c020o THE NEXT DAY A SIMILAR WIRE WAS SENT THIS ONE SEEKING TO SELL ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SHARES OF CONTROL DATA
c16c020p THE MINORITY REPORT AGREES WITH THE POINT MADE IN THESE COLUMNS THAT THE ARMS SALES AND DIVERSION WERE FULLY WITHIN THE CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH
c16c020q THE ADMINISTRATION DID PROCEED LEGALLY IN PURSUING BOTH ITS CONTRA POLICY AND THE IRAN ARMS INITIATIVE THE REPORT SAYS
c16c020r IT ADDS NEW EVIDENCE FROM THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY THAT THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL WAS NOT COVERED BY THE BOLAND AMENDMENTS THEIR CONSTITUTIONALITY ASIDE
c16c020s FOR THE NINE MONTHS NET INCREASED TO ABOUT SIX MILLION DOLLARS OR FIFTY NINE CENTS A SHARE FROM THREE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR EARLIER
c16c020t NINE MONTH NET A YEAR AGO INCLUDED FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OF SPECIAL ITEMS
c16c020u SALES NEARLY DOUBLED TO ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM NINETY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
c16c020v NEARLY ALL THE GAINERS WERE COMPANIES THAT SELL TO CUSTOMERS OTHER THAN PERSONAL COMPUTER MAKERS
c16c020w INTEL THE BIGGEST O. T. C. SEMICONDUCTOR MAKER AND BY FAR THE LARGEST ELECTRONICS ISSUE ON NASDAQ FELL ONE QUARTER TO TWENTY THREE AND THREE QUARTERS
c16c020x L. S. I. LOGIC ANOTHER BIG SEMICONDUCTOR CONCERN WITH SOME P. C. MAKING CUSTOMERS WAS UNCHANGED AT SEVEN AND THREE QUARTERS
c16c020y BUT A RAFT OF SMALLER ELECTRONICS ISSUES HELPED PUSH THE NASDAQ ELECTRONICS GROUP'S AVERAGE UP MORE THAN ONE PERCENT
c16c020z MR. PEABODY AND OTHERS WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE BANK PURSUE ADDED CAPITAL AND DISPOSE OF TROUBLED LOANS MORE AGGRESSIVELY
c16c0210 FIRST REPUBLIC HOWEVER INSISTS THAT IT ISN'T IN ANY DANGER
c16c0211 IT'S A LONG BALL GAME AND WE'RE THROUGH A QUARTER HERE MR. FRONTERHOUSE SAYS
c16c0212 YOU JUST HAVE TO TAKE A LONGER VIEW
c16c0213 THE SUN BELT FORECAST PARTLY CLOUDY
c16c0214 ECONOMISTS EXPECT THE SOUTHEAST BUFFERED BY ITS BIG SERVICE ECONOMY TO CONTINUE TO OUTPERFORM THE NATION
c16c0215 BUT SOME OVERBUILT REAL ESTATE MARKETS COULD GET BASHED AND FLORIDA'S INFLUX OF RETIREES JOB SEEKERS AND TOURISTS COULD DWINDLE
c16c0216 EVENTUALLY THE FLIGHT LANDED AT A NEARBY AIRPORT
c16c0217 BUT THE TERMINAL FACILITIES WERE CLOSED SO MR. BARRETT AND FIVE OTHER PASSENGERS HAD TO SCALE A WIRE FENCE TO GET OUT
c16c0218 A NEARBY HOTEL PICKED THEM UP AND CHARGED THEM EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS EACH FOR THE VAN RIDE
c16c0219 CRISP DECISIONS OF COURSE HAVE NEVER BEEN THE STUFF OF POLITICS
c16c021a BUT I HAVE BEEN OPINING ON POLITICAL ISSUES FOR A NATIONAL NEWSPAPER FOR A GENERATION NOW AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN RATIONALITY AND COHERENCE COUNT FOR LESS
c16c021b FRIENDS WITH FAR LONGER EXPERIENCE AT THE JUNCTION OF POLITICS AND IDEAS SAY THE SAME THING
c16c021c THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN SLIPPING DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO PROCEDURAL QUICKSAND UNTIL WE ARE NOW SUNK IN A PROFOUND INSTITUTIONAL AND EVEN CONSTITUTIONAL MORASS
c16c021d FIRST INTERSTATE'S FOURTH QUARTER LOSS RESULTED FROM A PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR ADDITION TO ITS RESERVES AGAINST POSSIBLE FOREIGN DEBT LOSSES
c16c021e BUT EVEN WITHOUT THE RESERVES THE COMPANY SAID EARNINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN FLAT AT ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED WITH THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER
c16c021f FIRST INTERSTATE HAD A SLIGHT DECLINE IN EARNINGS ASSETS AND NEGLIGIBLE GROWTH IN NET INTEREST INCOME
c16c021g NONINTEREST INCOME FELL SEVENTEEN PERCENT PARTLY BECAUSE YEAR EARLIER RESULTS INCLUDED A NINETEEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLAR PRETAX GAIN ON THE SALE OF A BUILDING
c16c021h IN ADDITION TO THE NEWS SERVICE NEW YORK BASED DOW JONES PUBLISHES THE WALL STREET JOURNAL BARRON'S MAGAZINE AND OTHER PERIODICALS AND COMMUNITY NEWSPAPERS
c16c021i IT ALSO OWNS FIFTY SIX PERCENT OF TELERATE INCORPORATED WHICH PROVIDES COMPUTERIZED FINANCIAL INFORMATION ON GLOBAL MARKETS
c16c021j CUSTOMERS OF TELERATE RECEIVE THE DOW JONES NEWS SERVICE AS PART OF THE PACKAGE
c16c021k THE SEVEN SIGNATORIES HAVE AGREED TO POLICIES AIMED AT REDUCING THEIR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL IMBALANCES
c16c021l THUS THEY ARE MAKING A CONTRIBUTION TO STABILIZING THEIR EXCHANGE RELATIONS JEOPARDIZED BY THE HIGHLY EXCESSIVE DEFICITS AND SURPLUSES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED IN RECENT YEARS
c16c021m MOREOVER THEY ARE READY IF NEED BE TO INTERVENE ON EXCHANGE MARKETS
c16c021n THE TRADE BILL WOULD DIRECT PRESIDENTIAL ACTION AGAINST COUNTRIES THAT PERMIT PIRACY OF U. S. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
c16c021o IT WOULD REQUIRE THE PRESIDENT TO IDENTIFY COUNTRIES THAT DON'T PROTECT COPYRIGHTS AND PATENTS AND TO INITIATE EXPEDITED UNFAIR TRADE INVESTIGATIONS IN THE MOST EGREGIOUS CASES
c16c021p THE PRESIDENT COULD DECLINE TO MOVE AGAINST CERTAIN COUNTRIES IF DOING SO WOULD BE AGAINST THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC INTEREST THOUGH
c16c021q CONGRESS WANTS SPEEDY ACTION BECAUSE TIME OFTEN CAN BE CRITICAL IN WINNING PROTECTION FOR CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SUCH AS COMPUTER SOFTWARE WHICH CAN BE COPIED RAPIDLY
c16c021r OF COURSE TO A GREAT EXTENT THE STOCK PRICES OF THE VARIOUS COMPANIES THAT WILL BE REPORTING HIGHER EARNINGS ALREADY REFLECT SHAREHOLDER EXPECTATIONS
c16c021s THAT OBVIOUSLY WILL MUTE THE PRICE MOVEMENTS OF ANY PARTICULAR STOCK WHEN THE COMPANY REPORTS ITS EARNINGS UNLESS ANALYSTS' ESTIMATES ARE SERIOUSLY OUT OF KILTER
c16c021t AS PORTFOLIO STRATEGISTS PUZZLE OVER THE MARKET IMPACT OF THIS WAVE OF GOOD NEWS THEY COME UP WITH SOME SHARPLY DIVERGENT OPINIONS
c16c021u MARCH TYPICALLY BENEFITS FROM SEASONAL FACTORS THAT BOOST U. S. EXPORTS
c16c021v AND IMPORTS OF OIL AND AUTOS ARE EXPECTED TO BE LOWER FURTHER HELPING LIGHTEN THE TRADE IMBALANCE
c16c021w MANY ECONOMISTS BELIEVE THAT AT THE VERY LEAST THE UNDERLYING TREND CONTINUES TO CALL FOR GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT
c16c021x PENNWALT DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE CENTAUR LETTER
c16c021y BUT IN A PREPARED STATEMENT CHAIRMAN EDWIN E. TUTTLE SAID THE PROPOSED SALE OF THE UNITS WOULD BE AN EFFECTIVE DETERRENT TO ANY TAKEOVERS
c16c021z THE COMPANY SAID IT BEGAN CONSIDERING THE UNIT SALES SEVERAL MONTHS AGO WHEN TAKEOVER SPECULATION ACCELERATED
c16c0220 FOR THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THIRD QUARTER THE MAGAZINE GROUP HAD PRETAX EARNINGS OF SIX POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS ON REVENUE OF FIFTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
c16c0221 THE EXPECTED EARNINGS DROP REFLECTS ONE FEWER ISSUE IN THE QUARTER OF FAMILY CIRCLE
c16c0222 ALSO THE COMPANY CITED DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR THREE NEW MAGAZINES
c16c0223 AND FOR THE TIME BEING AT LEAST AGASSI HAS THE UNCLUTTERED MIND OF YOUTH IN HIS FAVOR
c16c0224 ASKED WEDNESDAY IF HE THOUGHT HE WAS READY FOR THE OPEN GRIND MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY HE APPEARED PUZZLED
c16c0225 I KNOW I'M IN GREAT SHAPE BUT AS FAR AS I CAN SEE THERE'S NOTHING MENTAL ABOUT TENNIS HE SAID
c16c0226 ONCE I GET OUT THERE MY BODY JUST TAKES OVER
c16c0227 MR. PAPAGEORGE SAID THESE WERE CONCEPTUAL NEGOTIATIONS
c16c0228 IDEAS WERE FLOWING
c16c0229 WE WERE SEEING WHAT WORKED FOR EACH OF US
c16c022a THE TWO OF US WERE TRYING TO THINK OF A WAY TO SATISFY EVERYONE

c19c021u WHOSE FAULT IS IT THAT THESE FORECASTERS FAILED TO PREDICT THE STRONG GROWTH RATE IN FIRST QUARTER GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT
c19c021v POOR GOVERNMENT STATISTICS ACCORDING TO THE WALL STREET JOURNAL SHAKY STATISTICS POSE PERIL FOR FORECASTERS THE OUTLOOK MAY NINTH
c19c021w AND WHICH STATISTICAL SERIES MISLED THESE SEERS
c19c021x THE INDEX OF LEADING INDICATORS WE ARE TOLD
c19c021y IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO MANAGE SAYS A KEY PLAYER IN THE BATTLE
c19c021z IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF MONEY BECAUSE GENERALE DE BELGIQUE IS RICH NOW
c19c0220 IT'S A PROBLEM OF CULTURE AND STYLE OF MANAGEMENT
c19c0222 HIS COLUMNS OFTEN PROVIDE A FRESH SLANT ON THE MAJOR ISSUES OF THE DAY
c19c0223 HIS IDEAS ARE OFTEN CONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION BUT THEY PROVIDE NEW IDEAS TO BROADEN THE READER'S OWN PERSPECTIVE
c19c0224 TAKEOVER TALK AROUSED INTEREST IN TWO FINANCIAL CONCERNS
c19c0225 MERCANTILE BANCORP SOARED FIVE AND ONE HALF TO THIRTY AND THREE QUARTERS ON RENEWED BUYOUT SPECULATION
c19c0226 SUN STATE SAVINGS AND LOAN ENDED AT EIGHT AND ONE QUARTER UP TWO AFTER CONFIRMING THAT IT RECEIVED AN UNSOLICITED ACQUISITION PROPOSAL FROM AN INVESTMENT GROUP
c19c0227 ONE SIMPLE MOTIVATION IS BEHIND THE NETWORKS' PUMPED UP MARKETING EFFORTS DESPERATION
c19c0228 COMPANIES THAT ONCE HAD TO ADVERTISE ON THE NETWORKS IF THEY WANTED TO REACH A MASS AUDIENCE NOW CAN CHOOSE INSTEAD FROM A HOST OF CABLE AND INDEPENDENT STATIONS
c19c0229 AT THE SAME TIME MARKETERS HAVE PULLED MONEY OUT OF ADVERTISING TO SINK IT INTO PROMOTIONS SUCH AS COUPONS AND SWEEPSTAKES IN THE PAST FEW YEARS
c19c022a KEVIN O'CONNELL SALES MANAGER AT TOYOTA OF ORANGE SAID OCTOBER WAS SLOWER THAN USUAL AT THE BIG SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DEALERSHIP
c19c022b THE PROBLEMS HE SAID ARE THE TRADITIONAL AFTER SUMMER BLUES IN THE LOCAL CAR MARKET AND THE STRONG JAPANESE YEN
c19c022c THERE'S PROBABLY A FEW PEOPLE WHO COME IN MORE SO THAN IN THE PAST AND SUFFER FROM STICKER SHOCK HE SAID
c19c022d THIS YEAR THE SOVIETS HAVE MOVED COMMERCIAL SALES TO THE FRONT BURNER
c19c022e THE EXPORT ARM OF THE SOVIET MINISTRY OF AVIATION INDUSTRY HOPES TO DOUBLE ITS REVENUE BY THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES
c19c022f BUT SUCH A SHIFT WOULD BRING MAJOR UPHEAVALS TO THE SOVIET SYSTEM
c19c022g ORDERS FOR MILITARY AIRCRAFT HAVE FALLEN TWENTY PERCENT IN THE PAST TWO YEARS ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES
c19c022h AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES PRESTIGIOUS MILITARY DESIGN BUREAUS IN THE SOVIET UNION ARE DEVOTING SUBSTANTIAL MANPOWER TO CIVILIAN PROJECTS
c19c022i THIS GROWING RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES TO SELL PRODUCTS COULD HINDER HEWLETT PACKARD'S ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESS AND MAKE THE COMPANY'S STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS
c19c022j YOU BOUGHT H. P. STOCK IN THE PAST BECAUSE IT HAD MORE CONTROL OVER ITS DESTINY THAN OTHER ELECTRONICS FIRMS MR. WU SAID
c19c022k TODAY H. P. HAS LESS CONTROL OVER ITS FUTURE
c1ac0201 SURVEYS HAVE CONSISTENTLY SHOWN THAT PEOPLE HAVE A LOW OPINION OF OUR PRODUCTS OUR SERVICES AND OUR COMPANIES MR. MAURER SAID
c1ac0202 THIS PERCEPTION HAS PERSISTED FOR YEARS
c1ac0203 IT HAS NOT IMPROVED AND IS IN FACT GETTING WORSE
c1ac0204 DREXEL BURNHAM HAD A MAJOR ROLE IN EVERY TRANSACTION UNDER INVESTIGATION IN THE IVAN BOESKY INSIDER TRADING CASE AN ANALYSIS SHOWS
c1ac0205 IT ALSO HAS EMERGED THAT BOESKY HIMSELF WAS A MAJOR INVESTOR IN EVERY INSTANCE
c1ac0206 BOESKY MEANWHILE APPEARS TO HAVE SPEEDED UP THE LIQUIDATION OF HIS OPERATIONS
c1ac0207 OCCIDENTAL OFFICALS SAY THE MINE WILL START COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS NEXT SEPTEMBER MORE THAN TWO YEARS BEHIND SCHEDULE
c1ac0208 THE MINE IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE BETWEEN THIRTEEN MILLION AND THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION TONS OF STEAMING COAL ANNUALLY USED AT ELECTRIC GENERATING PLANTS SAYS MR. OGDEN
c1ac0209 ALL BUT TEN PERCENT OF THE OUTPUT IS FOR EXPORT MOSTLY TO JAPAN SOUTH KOREA AND HONG KONG
c1ac020a MOST UNUSUALLY THIS TIME AROUND THE CYCLICAL CLIMB IN PLANT USAGE HASN'T YET OCCURRED
c1ac020b AS THE EXPANSION KEEPS ROLLING HOWEVER THIS IS EXPECTED TO COME
c1ac020c WHEN IT DOES FORECASTERS LOOK FOR BRISKER CAPITAL SPENDING AS WELL REGARDLESS OF THE NEW TAX RULES
c1ac020d TEXAS UTILITIES COMPANY SAID ITS TEXAS UTILITIES ELECTRIC COMPANY UNIT RECEIVED PERMISSION FROM THE STATE'S PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION TO REFUND ABOUT FIFTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO ITS CUSTOMERS
c1ac020f THE REFUND WILL SHOW UP AS A CREDIT IN FEBRUARY ELECTRIC BILLS THE UNIT SAID
c1ac020h BUT THE POINT HERE IS THAT HE IS TRYING TO ARRANGE IT SO THAT HE WILL STILL WIELD THE REAL POWER FROM BEHIND THE SCENES EVEN AFTER HIS RESIGNATION
c1ac020j WHAT KOREA IS NOW SUFFERING TO OVERCOME IS MAINLY A POLITICAL NOT ECONOMIC PROBLEM
c1ac020k REFORMS THAT DO NOT CHANGE THE PRESENT POLITICAL SYSTEM ARE NOT REFORMS
c1ac020l THE SYSTEM ISN'T ONE HUNDRED PERCENT PERFECT BUT IT'S WORKING REASONABLY WELL A FOREIGN MINISTER OFFICIAL TOLD REPORTERS
c1ac020m THE OFFICIAL SAID THE U. S. HAS BEEN SIMILARLY REASSURED
c1ac020n EVEN SO THE U. S. HAS INDICATED THAT IT WANTS JAPAN TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF HOW JAPANESE TECHNOLOGY IS SOLD AROUND THE WORLD
c1ac020o THE LOAN IS PART OF A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PLAN TO EXPAND THE MINE'S RESERVES AND ALLOW IT TO KEEP OPERATING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY FOUR
c1ac020p WITHOUT THE EXPANSION THE MINE WAS THREATENED WITH CLOSURE NEXT YEAR
c1ac020q CLOSURE WOULD MEAN THE LOSS OF SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTEEN JOBS
c1ac020r HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
c1ac020s TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
c1ac020t THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
c1ac020u WITH LESS REGULATORY AND POLITICAL PRESSURE CONRAIL WAS ABLE TO ABANDON ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND MILES OF TRACK BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE AND NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
c1ac020v ABOUT HALF OF THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN UP BY SHORT LINE RAILROADS NONUNION RAILROADS THAT HAVE CONTINUED TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE AT A LESSER COST
c1ac020x THAT FOLKSY AND DIRECT APOLOGY WILL BE CARRIED IN NATIONWIDE NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENTS CHRYSLER PLANS TO START PLACING TODAY
c1ac020z DISCONNECTING ODOMETERS IS A LOUSY IDEA
c1ac0210 THAT'S A MISTAKE WE WON'T MAKE AGAIN AT CHRYSLER
c1ac0211 PERIOD
c1ac0212 DAVID FLEISCHER AN ANALYST AT PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES THINKS TENNECO BY NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETEEN NINETY ONE COULD EARN EIGHT DOLLARS A SHARE FROM EXISTING OPERATIONS
c1ac0213 THAT WOULD BE A SIXFOLD INCREASE FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PROFIT WHICH HE PUTS AT ONLY ONE DOLLAR AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS A SHARE
c1ac0214 TENNECO STANDS TO BENEFIT GREATLY FROM A PICKUP AT ITS OIL AND GAS AND FARM EQUIPMENT BUSINESSES HE SAYS
c1ac0215 THE SPOKESMAN ALSO SAID THE LEAGUE'S OWNERS ARE COMMITTED TO PLAYING WITH THEIR CURRENT REPLACEMENT ROSTERS FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON INCLUDING THE SUPER BOWL IF NECESSARY
c1ac0216 THAT MAY BE THE CASE IF MR. UPSHAW CAN BE TAKEN AT HIS WORD
c1ac0217 HE HAS SAID THAT THE PLAYERS WILL REMAIN ON STRIKE FOR THE DURATION IF THE UNION'S OFFER WAS REJECTED
c1ac0218 HOURLY COMPENSATION AT NONFINANCIAL FIRMS ROSE AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF THREE PERCENT IN NOMINAL TERMS BUT FELL ZERO POINT EIGHT PERCENT WHEN ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION

c1ac021a UNIT LABOR COSTS INCREASED AT A ZERO POINT FOUR PERCENT YEARLY RATE IN THE THIRD QUARTER AFTER A TWO PERCENT RATE OF GAIN IN THE SECOND QUARTER
c1ac021b BOB DOLE AL HAIG AND JACK KEMP ALL HAVE PICKED UP THE IRAN CONTRA CLUB TO USE ON MR. BUSH
c1ac021c WE'RE INCLINED TO THINK THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT DESERVES SOME DEFENDING ON THIS POINT
c1ac021d HE ALONE SEEMS WILLING TO SAY THAT A LINE HAS TO BE DRAWN SOMEWHERE IN FRONT OF THE DEAD END POLITICS OF THE IRAN CONTRA AFFAIR
c1ac021e IN AN INTERVIEW MR. EXLEY SAID DEMAND IS STRONG BOTH IN THE U. S. AND IN MAJOR FOREIGN MARKETS WITH PERSONAL COMPUTERS LEADING THE WAY
c1ac021f ALSO THE COMPANY WHICH OBTAINED ABOUT FIFTY FOUR PERCENT OF REVENUE FROM ABROAD LAST YEAR CONTINUES TO BENEFIT FROM THE WEAKER DOLLAR
c1ac021g IN ADDITION N. C. R. IS REPURCHASING ITS OWN SHARES IN THE OPEN MARKET MR. EXLEY SAID
c1ac021h FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS AFTER THE STOCK MARKET CRASH NEW INVESTORS IN THE COLLECTIBLES MARKETS ARE SKITTISH
c1ac021i BUYERS HAVE BECOME CHOOSY AND ARE STAYING ON THE SIDELINES
c1ac021j EVERYONE IS WAITING FOR THE OTHER SHOE TO DROP SAYS GEORGE LOWRY PRESIDENT OF SWANN GALLERIES A NEW YORK AUCTION HOUSE
c1ac021k S. D. I. DESPITE WHAT THE DEFENSE LUDDITES SAY IS NOT AN ADVENTURE IN TECHNOLOGY APPLICATION
c1ac021l IT IS A TOOL OF NATIONAL POLICY AND AS WITH ANY TOOL IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE USED WITH A SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE IN MIND
c1ac021m THE OBJECTIVE LEST WE FORGET IT IS TO PREVENT A GLOBAL NUCLEAR WAR
c1ac021n MANY PARENTS IMPATIENT FOR CHANGE IN THE SCHOOLS RESPOND BY KEEPING THEIR KIDS OUT OF KINDERGARTEN AN EXTRA YEAR
c1ac021o MOTIVES ARE MIXED
c1ac021p SOME SAY THEY WANT TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN OTHERS ANGLE FOR AN AGE ADVANTAGE THAT WILL VAULT THEIR OFFSPRING TO THE HEAD OF THE CLASS THE FOLLOWING YEAR
c1ac021r THE TWO LABORATORIES THAT NICHOLS PURCHASED ARE IN LINCOLN NEBRASKA AND SIOUX CITY IOWA
c1ac021s INITIAL PAYMENTS FOR THE LABS TOTALED ELEVEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND PREFERRED STOCK
c1ac021t ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS TO BE MADE OVER AN EIGHT YEAR PERIOD HAVE A CURRENT VALUE OF SIX POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS NICHOLS SAID
c1ac021u THE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS ARE CONTINGENT UPON CERTAIN MATERIAL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS OF THE TWO LABS REMAINING INTACT FOR THREE YEARS NICHOLS SAID
c1ac021v TEXAS HAS BOTH WINNERS AND LOSERS THIS YEAR
c1ac021w IT'S A KIND OF GOOD NEWS BAD NEWS YEAR SAYS RODNEY MOSIER EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT FOR THE TEXAS WHEAT PRODUCERS ASSOCIATION
c1ac021x IN SEVERAL AREAS WHERE RAIN HAS BEEN AMPLE TEXAS WHEAT FARMERS HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED THE STATE'S TWENTY NINE BUSHEL PER ACRE AVERAGE
c1ac021y IF YOU HAVE THE WHEAT THEN PRICES ARE TERRIFIC SAYS MR. MOSIER
c1ac021z BUT THOSE FARMERS THAT AREN'T GETTING THE YIELDS BECAUSE OF THE DROUGHT LOSE OUT TWICE HE SAYS BECAUSE THE HIGH PRICES ARE CUTTING DOWN ON GOVERNMENT SUPPORT PAYMENTS
c1ac0220 THIS WAS ROUGH ON ALL DEBTORS DOMESTIC AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL
c1ac0221 BUT NO ONE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS FOR DOMESTIC DEBTORS AS GRAND AS THOSE OFFICIALLY OFFERED FOR THIRD WORLD DEBTORS
c1ac0222 THE FIRST PART OF THE OFFICIAL PROPOSAL WAS TO REDUCE THE INTEREST BURDEN OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
c1ac0223 SECOND PROMOTE WORLD ECONOMIC RECOVERY
c1ac0224 THIRD NEW LOANS SHOULD BE MADE TO THE DEBTOR NATIONS BY THE BANKS THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE WORLD BANK AND EXPORT CREDIT AGENCIES
c1ac0225 THE CONTRACT NOW UNDER NEGOTIATION IS EXPECTED TO BE SIMILAR IN VOLUME AND SCOPE TO THE CURRENT SEVENTEEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT
c1ac0226 THE CONTRACT CALLS FOR THE UNIT TO PROVIDE ENGINEERING AND OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES RELATED TO THE AGENCY'S ADMINISTRATION OF THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM
c1ac0227 THE ENGINEERING PLANNING AND ARCHITECTURAL CONCERN IS IN THE FINAL YEAR OF ITS CURRENT THREE YEAR CONTRACT WITH THE AGENCY
c1ac0228 SO SO
c1ac0229 THAT MAKES THE PROBLEM A LITTLE HARDER
c1ac022a LET ME THINK FOR A MINUTE
c1ac022b I DON'T KNOW IF THE PARENTS UNDERSTAND HOW SUBTLE THIS NEW AGE MOVEMENT REALLY IS SHE SAYS
c1ac022c THEY DRAW THE KIDS IN WITH FAIRY TALES AND SORCERY
c1ac022d THEIR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO DO AWAY WITH ANYBODY WHO BELIEVES THERE'S SUCH A THING AS EVIL
c1ac022e THREE YEARS AGO WHEN THE MOSLEM LEAGUE CAME INTO THE SHARED POWER ARRANGEMENT MR. IJAZ ALI GOT INTO THE PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY
c1ac022f THERE HE WRUNG THOUSANDS OF RUPEES FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO BUILD ROADS SCHOOLS AND ELECTRIFICATION SYSTEMS IN HIS DISTRICT
c1ac022g THE GOVERNMENT'S IDEA WAS TO OUTFLANK THE P. P. P. OPPOSITION THROUGH PUBLIC WORKS
c1bc0201 BUT WHILE EUREKA PROJECTS ARE MORE EASILY APPROVED THE VAGUENESS OF THEIR FUNDING IS ONE REASON MANY EUROPEAN COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE PROGRAM'S VALUE
c1bc0202 ANOTHER IS ITS LOOSE ORGANIZATION WITH NO CENTRAL SYSTEM YET ESTABLISHED FOR CHECKING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS
c1bc0203 MOST OF THE PROJECTS ADOPTED OVER THE PAST YEAR HAVEN'T GOTTEN OFF THE DRAWING BOARD
c1bc0204 BRITAIN IS LAUNCHING A NATIONWIDE AIDS WARNING CAMPAIGN THAT URGES THE USE OF CONDOMS FOR PEOPLE WHO WON'T RESTRICT THEIR SEXUAL PARTNERS
c1bc0205 LEAFLETS THAT ARE BEING DELIVERED TO TWENTY THREE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS WARN THAT AIDS ISN'T LIMITED TO HOMOSEXUALS
c1bc0206 OFFICIALS SAY TELEVISION WARNINGS WILL FOLLOW
c1bc0207 LAS PATIENTS ARE AFFLICTED WITH THE AIDS VIRUS AND SUFFER FROM AN INFLAMMATION OF THE LYMPH NODES
c1bc0208 ARC PATIENTS MAY HAVE THE LYMPH CONDITION BUT THEY ALSO SUFFER FROM PRE AIDS AILMENTS THAT MAY INCLUDE SWOLLEN GLANDS FEVERS WEIGHT LOSS AND DIARRHEA
c1bc0209 IN BOTH STUDIES PATIENTS RECEIVED SIX HUNDRED OR EIGHT HUNDRED MILLIGRAMS OF VIRAZOLE OR A PLACEBO
c1bc020a MR. WYLIE SAID THE G. O. P. MEMBERS PREFERRED THE HOUSING BILL PASSED BY THE SENATE
c1bc020b THAT BILL WOULD PROVIDE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AUTHORIZATION LEVELS FOR TWO YEARS AND FEWER PROGRAM CHANGES
c1bc020c IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BY ITS SPONSORS AS A HOUSEKEEPING BILL DESIGNED TO GIVE LAWMAKERS MORE TIME TO DEBATE THE THRUST OF THE NATION'S HOUSING PROGRAMS
c1bc020d NOTES FROM THE FRONT THE SAME BROKER PUT ME ON HOLD EARLY IN THE PHONE CALL
c1bc020e I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT HE SAID THIRTY SECONDS LATER
c1bc020f THE GOLD MARKET WAS JUST CLOSING
c1bc020g I HAD TO PUT AN ORDER IN
c1bc020h WHILE OTHER OPEC MEMBERS RECOGNIZE THE ADVANTAGE OF GOING DOWNSTREAM MOST LACK KUWAIT'S MONEY SMALL POPULATION AND ABILITY TO MOVE FAST
c1bc020i WE CAN'T ARGUE THAT STRONGLY FOR SPENDING BILLIONS ABROAD TO BUY DOWNSTREAM FACILITIES SAYS A VENEZUELAN OIL OFFICIAL
c1bc020j OUR PEOPLE ARE STILL HUNGRY AND OUR DOMESTIC ECONOMY NEEDS THE MONEY MORE
c1bc020k IN THE CAREFREE DAYS BEFORE DEREGULATION IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT FIVE BIG AIRLINES HANDLED MOST OF THE PASSENGER TRAFFIC IN AND OUT OF LAMBERT STREET
c1bc020l LOUIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
c1bc020m THEN CAME THE AIR WARS
c1bc020n AFTER DECONTROL NINE MORE AIRLINES INVADED THE MARKET ALL TRYING TO LURE A SHARE OF THE TWENTY MILLION TRAVELERS WHO USE THIS AIRPORT EACH YEAR
c1bc020o MR. BEENEY THEN SUBPOENAED THE LIQUIDATOR DEMANDING THE FILES
c1bc020p IN A LETTER TO MR. WIENER HE SAID HE WAS SERVING THE SUBPOENA ON BEHALF OF DOCTOR WYNYARD WHOM HE IDENTIFIED AS THE EXECUTOR OF HIS FATHER'S ESTATE
c1bc020q MR. WIENER SAID IN HIS AFFIDAVIT THAT MR. BEENEY ALSO ASSURED HIM THE FILES WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO LAWYERS FOR THE OTHER SIDE
c1bc020r SIGNS OF CHANGE ARE EVERYWHERE
c1bc020s ALTHOUGH FEW FIRMS ADMIT TO STAFF CUTS MANY ARE QUIETLY PRUNING THEIR RANKS
c1bc020t MANY HAVE SHIFTED THEIR SPECIALISTS IN TAX EXEMPT HOUSING BONDS WHERE ACTIVITY IS PARTICULARLY LOW TO THEIR MORTGAGE BACKED BOND OPERATIONS
c1bc020u COMPUTER MAKERS AND THE CUSTOMS SERVICE DISAGREE OVER HOW MOTHER BOARDS WERE PREVIOUSLY TREATED FOR TARIFF PURPOSES
c1bc020v THE CUSTOMS SERVICE SAYS THE INTEL RULING ONLY REAFFIRMED LONGTIME TARIFF POLICY AND DIDN'T REPRESENT A CHANGE
c1bc020w BUT THE TRADE GROUP SAYS IT HAS EVIDENCE GOING BACK FOR FIFTEEN YEARS THAT THE BOARDS HAVE BEEN LEVIED AS PARTS NOT COMPUTERS
c1bc020x BUT FIRST CITY WOUND UP MAKING LOANS TO SOME OF THE MOST TROUBLED ENERGY CONCERNS IN TEXAS
c1bc020y IT CONCENTRATED MORE THAN A THIRD OF ITS ENERGY LENDING IN THE ROLLERCOASTER FORTUNES OF SERVICE AND DRILLING COMPANIES
c1bc020z WHEN THE ENERGY INDUSTRY WAS GROWING THE LOANS WERE HIGHLY PROFITABLE OFTEN YIELDING TWO OR THREE POINTS OVER THE PRIME RATE
c1bc0210 BUT WHEN OIL PRICES FELL IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO AND EXPLORATION SLOWED THESE COMPANIES SOME OF THEM YOUNG AND HIGHLY LEVERAGED QUICKLY RAN INTO PROBLEMS
c1bc0211 MR. ANTONIU'S FALL AND SURPRISING REBOUND PROVE THERE IS LIFE AFTER INSIDER TRADING
c1bc0212 BUT HIS STORY ALSO SUGGESTS THAT SOME CHARACTER TRAITS THAT MAY GIVE RISE TO INSIDER TRADING CAN BE HARD TO CHANGE
c1bc0213 INSIDER TRADING IS A FORM OF FRAUD AND SOME SPORT ABOUT FRANCHISEES NOW CLAIM THEY HAVE BEEN DEFRAUDED BY MR. ANTONIU
c1bc0214 MOST FINANCIAL MARKETS REACTED COOLLY TO FRIDAY'S DEFICIT AGREEMENT
c1bc0215 THE DOLLAR AND BOND PRICES FELL WHILE STOCKS EDGED HIGHER IN THE FINAL HOUR OF TRADING
c1bc0216 THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS CLOSED UP NINE POINT FOUR FIVE AT ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE POINT OH EIGHT
c1bc0217 FOREIGN STOCK MARKETS GENERALLY GAINED
c1bc0218 CONSIDER UNITED AIRLINES ONE OF THE I. B. M. NINE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY'S FIRST CUSTOMERS
c1bc0219 IT BOUGHT THE MACHINE FOR A NEW SYSTEM TO LINK ITS RESERVATIONS COMPUTER WITH TRAVEL AGENTS
c1bc021a BUT THE SYSTEM UNITED UNVEILED THIS MONTH HAD I. B. M. PERSONAL COMPUTERS DOING SOME TASKS ORIGINALLY EARMARKED FOR THE NINE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY
c1bc021b UNITED SAYS IT HAS BEEN BUYING NINE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTIES MORE SLOWLY THAN IT ORIGINALLY PLANNED
c1bc021c I THINK THE MARKET JUMPED THE GUN ON THE NOTION OF A WEAK ECONOMY AND THE FED EASING MR. FINE SAID
c1bc021d SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS A CONSOLIDATION
c1bc021e HE EXPECTS LONG TERM TREASURY BOND YIELDS TO HOVER AROUND THE EIGHT AND ONE HALF PERCENT LEVEL IN THE NEAR FUTURE
c1bc021f WHILE FORMER EXECUTIVE BRANCH OFFICIALS FACE JAIL FOR NON CRIMES CONGRESS IS ABUSING THE JUDICIAL PROCESS IN SEEKING IMMUNITY FROM LIBEL SUITS
c1bc021g THE U. S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D. C. CIRCUIT HELD LAST NOVEMBER THAT CONGRESSMEN CAN BE SUED FOR STATEMENTS MADE OUTSIDE CONGRESS
c1bc021h LAWYER STEVEN ROSS WHOSE BOSS IS HOUSE SPEAKER JIM WRIGHT APPEALED TO THE ENTIRE CIRCUIT WITH NO SUCCESS
c1bc021i BUT ROBERT BORK HAS LEFT THE COURT SO MR. ROSS WILL TRY AGAIN
c1bc021j THE CIRCUIT HAS NEVER GRANTED A SECOND TRY BUT MR. ROSS SEEMS TO THINK IT'S WORTH ANOTHER SHOT
c1bc021k TEMPORARY PART TIME AND CONTRACT WORKERS NOW MAKE UP NEARLY ONE THIRD OF THE U. S. WORK FORCE
c1bc021l THE INCREASING DEMAND FOR THEIR SERVICES STEMS FROM CORPORATE EFFORTS TO KEEP FULL TIME STAFFS AS LEAN AS POSSIBLE
c1bc021m WHEN BUSINESS TURNS UP COMPANIES CAN HIRE TEMPORARY WORKERS WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY FULL TIME SALARIES AND BENEFITS
c1bc021n AND WHEN BUSINESS TURNS DOWN COMPANIES CAN AVOID FIRING FULL TIME STAFF
c1bc021o FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S THE BAFFLING CASE OF A YOUNG CHILD WHO SIMPLY STOPPED GROWING FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
c1bc021p DOCTORS COULDN'T IDENTIFY A MEDICAL REASON
c1bc021q THE TENTATIVE DIAGNOSIS HERE STRESS

c1bc021t BROKERS CITED STRONG FOREIGN DEMAND WHICH DROVE UP TRADING IN FELDMUEHLE TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SHARES NEARLY FOUR TIMES RECENT LEVELS
c1bc021u BUT THE BROKERS SAID THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE ONLY ONE PARTY WAS ACCUMULATING MOST OF THE SHARES
c1bc021v OIL CHANGE CENTERS NUMBERED ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN FRANCHISED UNITS AT THE END OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
c1bc021w THAT'S EXPECTED TO DOUBLE BY YEAR END WITH REVENUE REACHING SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES
c1bc021x JIFFY LUBE INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED BALTIMORE IS THE LEADER WITH EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY UNITS BUT COMPETITION IS BREWING AS OTHER FIRMS LOOK TO EXPAND
c1bc021y THESE INCLUDE SOME MAJOR OIL COMPANIES INTERESTED IN BRAND AWARENESS
c1bc021z MS. LIU HAD HER FIRST CHILD A BOY TWO YEARS AGO
c1bc0220 SHE WAS URGED NOT TO HAVE ANOTHER
c1bc0221 SHE WAS EASY TO DEAL WITH THE PARTY SECRETARY BOASTS
c1bc0222 ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE GENERAL STRIKE FACTORIES CLOSED BUT BOOKSTORES REMAINED OPEN IN THIS OLD WORLD CULTURAL CENTER
c1bc0223 MOST SCHOOLS WERE SHUT BUT PUSHKIN STREET NEAR THE SQUARE REVERBERATED AS USUAL WITH THE SOUND OF BADLY PLAYED CHOPIN EMANATING FROM THE OPEN WINDOWS OF THE MUSIC ACADEMY
c1bc0224 MANY OF THE ARMENIAN DEMANDS ARE CULTURAL
c1bc0225 THEY WANT THEIR OLD FLAG REINSTATED THEIR CHILDREN SENT TO ARMENIAN SCHOOLS RATHER THAN RUSSIAN ONES THEIR OWN LANGUAGE USED ON OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS
c1bc0226 THEIR POLITICAL DEMANDS INCLUDE CALLS FOR A SEPARATE ARMY BRIGADE AND THE RIGHT FOR ARMENIA TO HAVE CONSULATES ABROAD
c1bc0227 THE COMPANY SAID THE RESULTS INDICATE ITS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE SALES ARE BEGINNING TO PAY OFF
c1bc0228 LAST YEAR THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS TRAINING TO IMPROVE SERVICE
c1bc0229 IN FEBRUARY IT LAUNCHED RADIO ADVERTISEMENTS FEATURING COMEDIAN MARTIN MULL AND IN APRIL IT UNVEILED A NEW MENU
c1bc022a IN MY MINISTRY WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE ALTERNATIVES OF INDEPENDENCE
c1bc022b THERE ARE ALREADY TWO GERMANYS AND TWO KOREAS
c1bc022c BUT AFTER CLOSE STUDY WE CONCLUDED THAT INDEPENDENCE IS A DEAD END
c1bc022d WHO WOULD RECOGNIZE US
c1bc022e AND IN THAT CASE WHAT'S THE USE OF DECLARING INDEPENDENCE
c1bc022f THE OFFICIAL ACKNOWLEDGED BUSINESS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE FREQUENCY OF GOVERNMENT CHANGES IN THE TAX LAW BUT HE DISMISSED THEM
c1bc022g STABILITY IS A NICE THING HE SAID
c1bc022h BUT IT'S ALWAYS TRUE THAT SYSTEMS WE HAVE IN PLACE HAVE BIASES IN THEM
c1bc022i THERE'S NO REASON WE SHOULDN'T WORK ON THEM
c1cc0201 SURVEYS HAVE CONSISTENTLY SHOWN THAT PEOPLE HAVE A LOW OPINION OF OUR PRODUCTS OUR SERVICES AND OUR COMPANIES MR. MAURER SAID

c1cc0207 THE S. E. C. SAYS ITS RULE PROHIBITS SHAREHOLDERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN A TENDER OFFER FROM MAKING ADDITIONAL PROFITS BY SIMULTANEOUSLY SELLING SHORT OTHER STOCK IN THE COMPANY
c1cc0208 IN A SHORT SALE A HOLDER SELLS BORROWED STOCK THAT HE AGREES TO REPLACE LATER
c1cc0209 IN EFFECT THE HOLDER IS BETTING THAT THE PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK WILL DROP ALLOWING HIM TO PROFIT BY REPLACING HIS STOCK WITH CHEAPER STOCK
c1cc020a BROKERAGE STOCKS HAVE BEEN WILTING FOR MONTHS BUT MR. CHANOS THINKS THEY COULD GET HIT LATER THIS YEAR IF OTHER FIRMS REPORT DOWN QUARTERS
c1cc020c IT CLOSED YESTERDAY AT THIRTY NINE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS UP ONE EIGHTH
c1cc020d MR. CASH OF HARVARD ADDS THERE IS A SHORTSIGHTEDNESS ON THE PART OF THE SUPPLIERS
c1cc020e BY REDUCING THE IMPORTANCE OF PERSONAL CONTACTS AND ESTABLISHING STANDARDS FOR COMMUNICATION COMPUTERS GIVE THE BUYER AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOP ACROSS A BROADER LINE OF SUPPLIERS
c1cc020f HE SEES THE DAY WHEN AUTO MAKERS' COMPUTERS WILL SCAN THE COMPUTERS OF THEIR PRIMARY SUPPLIERS AND AUTOMATICALLY PLACE ORDERS WITH THE ONE OFFERING THE LOWEST PRICE
c1cc020g THE OLD WAREHOUSE WAS NEVER TORN DOWN IN FACT SAYS FATHER MERRILL WITH A FEW REPAIRS IT COULD BE AS GOOD AS NEW
c1cc020i FATHER MERRILL SAID IT IS HOPED THAT THE SINKS STOVES AND REFRIGERATORS NOW COLLECTING DUST AT THE TRIAD CENTER CAN BE PURCHASED AND RETURNED TO THE ORIGINAL LA MORENA

c1cc020r THE UNCERTAINTY OVER THE OWNERSHIP ISSUE IS COMPLICATING AN ARRAY OF OTHER IMPORTANT DECISIONS INCLUDING THE FINANCING AND MANAGEMENT OF WHATEVER COMPANY FINALLY EMERGES
c1cc020s THE LEVEL OF LABOR OWNERSHIP AFFECTS THE AMOUNT OF FINANCING THE COMPANY WILL NEED AND POSSIBLY WHO PROVIDES IT
c1cc020t IF THE LABOR GROUPS END UP WITH A CONTROLLING INTEREST THEY INTEND TO PICK THEIR OWN BOSSES
c1cc020u UNDER BANKRUPTCY LAW TEXACO ALONE CURRENTLY HAS THE RIGHT TO PROPOSE A REORGANIZATION PLAN FOR ITSELF
c1cc020v THAT RIGHT EXPIRES NEXT MONTH BUT TEXACO HAS ASKED JUDGE SCHWARTZBERG TO BLOCK PROPOSALS FROM ANY OTHER PARTIES UNTIL MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
c1cc020w THE PENNZOIL SPOKESMAN SAID THE REORGANIZATION PLAN TO BE OUTLINED TODAY WOULD BE PRESENTED AS PART OF A MOTION OPPOSING TEXACO'S REQUEST FOR MORE TIME
c1cc020x IN SOME SECTORS THOUGH INTRIGUING OPTIONS ARE SPRINGING UP
c1cc020y INVESTMENT CONSULTANTS MANY OF WHOM WORK FOR MAJOR BROKERAGES SCREEN MONEY MANAGERS FOR POTENTIAL CLIENTS
c1cc020z SEVERAL HAVE CREATED LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS THAT POOL THE MONEY OF INVESTORS WITH SIMILAR INVESTMENT GOALS
c1cc0210 THOSE PARTNERSHIPS ARE THEN MANAGED BY INDIVIDUAL PORTFOLIO MANAGERS
c1cc0211 ANNUAL FEES FOR SUCH ACCOUNTS HOWEVER OFTEN RUN AS HIGH AS THREE PERCENT INCLUDING TRANSACTION COSTS
c1cc0212 BEHIND THE CHAIRMANSHIP SPECULATION IS A GREATER DEBATE ABOUT MR. JOHNSON
c1cc0213 IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY PEOPLE ARE LABELED BY THEIR TRAINING
c1cc0214 ROGER SMITH IS AS G. M.'S TOP EXECUTIVE TRADITIONALLY HAS BEEN A FINANCE GUY
c1cc0215 SOME CRITICS SAY THAT IS EMBLEMATIC OF THE AUTO MAKER'S PROBLEMS AND THAT A PRODUCT GUY SHOULD RUN THE COMPANY
c1cc0216 DOES G. M. THEY ASK REALLY NEED A LEGAL GUY
c1cc0217 MR. JOHNSON'S SUPPORTERS RESPOND THAT MANAGEMENT QUALIFICATIONS ARE AS IMPORTANT AS AUTOMOTIVE EXPERTISE
c1cc0218 THE ROLLBACKS COULD BE UNEXPECTEDLY PAINFUL FOR SOME HOURLY WORKERS
c1cc0219 CHRYSLER'S UNEMPLOYMENT FUND HAS BEEN DRAINED TO THE POINT THAT BENEFITS ARE ALREADY BEING REDUCED A U. A. W. SPOKESMAN SAID
c1cc021a THE FUND HAS AT LEAST IN PART BEEN DRAINED BY WORKERS TEMPORARILY LAID OFF WHEN PLANTS WERE CLOSED DOWN FOR RETOOLING
c1cc021b AS A MANAGER MR. O'MALLEY CONCEDES HE PUSHES SUBORDINATES TO WORK LONG AND HARD HOURS IF NECESSARY
c1cc021c BUT AS A BOSS I PICK MY SPOTS TO BE TOUGH HE ADDS
c1cc021d I ALSO LIKE TO LET PROFESSIONALS SHOW HOW GOOD THEY CAN BE ON THEIR OWN
c1cc021e TRADING THIS WEEK MAY INDICATE THE MARKET'S DIRECTION WITH THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS NEAR THE OCTOBER NINETEENTH LOW
c1cc021f LAST WEEK STOCK PRICES WERE SENT TUMBLING BY SKITTISH INVESTORS MANY OF WHOM ARE CONCERNED WITH STAGFLATION
c1cc021g BOND PRICES FELL FRIDAY

c1cc021k MR. MCMILLIN SAID THE TWO RETAILING UNITS COULD FETCH BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
c1cc021l BUT SPECULATION IN RETAILING CIRCLES PUT THE POTENTIAL PRICE TAG AT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS
c1cc021m IT'S THE WORST TIME TO SELL A RETAILER SAID ONE INDUSTRY EXECUTIVE
c1cc021n THEY MISSED THE HIGH IN AUGUST WHEN PUBLICITY TRADED SPECIALTY RETAILERS WERE SELLING AT MULTIPLES AS HIGH AS THIRTY FIVE TIMES EARNINGS
c1cc021o NOW THEY'RE TRADING AT TEN TO TWELVE TIMES EARNINGS
c1cc021p DEALERS SAID ACTIVITY WAS SLOW BECAUSE OF THE U. S. HOLIDAY CELEBRATING THE BIRTHDAY OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR
c1cc021q MOST U. S. BANKS WERE CLOSED ALTHOUGH SEVERAL OF THE LARGER FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPARTMENTS REMAINED OPEN TO SERVICE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS AND TRADE WITH EUROPE
c1cc021r BUT EVEN THEY WOUND DOWN THEIR TRADING WHEN THE LONDON MARKET SHUT DOWN AROUND NOON E. S. T. OR AFTER THE CHICAGO FUTURES MARKET CLOSED LATER IN THE AFTERNOON
c1cc021s TO PUNISH CURRENCY SPECULATORS THE GOVERNMENT IS ALLOWING PEOPLE TO EXCHANGE A MAXIMUM OF TEN MILLION OLD CORDOBAS
c1cc021t ANYTHING OVER THAT CAN'T BE EXCHANGED BUT MUST BE DEPOSITED IN A BANK ACCOUNT
c1cc021u THE MOVES TOOK EFFECT YESTERDAY
c1cc021v EARLY YESTERDAY THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT RELEASED A REVISED ESTIMATE OF THE ECONOMY'S FOURTH QUARTER PERFORMANCE
c1cc021w THE REPORT SHOWED AN INFLATION ADJUSTED ANNUAL GROWTH RATE FOR THE PERIOD OF FOUR POINT FIVE PERCENT INSTEAD OF THE FOUR POINT TWO PERCENT PACE ESTIMATED PREVIOUSLY
c1cc021x MANY ANALYSTS THOUGH HAD EXPECTED EVEN STRONGER GROWTH OF ABOUT FIVE PERCENT OR MORE
c1cc021y MR. THAYER SAID MR. YOUNG RECEIVED A LUMP SUM PAYMENT TO SETTLE HIS CONTRACT WITH GIBRALTAR FINANCIAL BUT WOULDN'T DISCLOSE THE AMOUNT
c1cc021z MR. YOUNG'S CONTRACT WHICH RAN UNTIL JANUARY TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN NINETY ONE CALLED FOR A SALARY OF AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
c1cc0220 IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX MR. YOUNG WAS PAID FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY SIX DOLLARS
c1cc0221 OIL CHANGE CENTERS NUMBERED ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN FRANCHISED UNITS AT THE END OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
c1cc0222 THAT'S EXPECTED TO DOUBLE BY YEAR END WITH REVENUE REACHING SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES
c1cc0223 JIFFY LUBE INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED BALTIMORE IS THE LEADER WITH EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY UNITS BUT COMPETITION IS BREWING AS OTHER FIRMS LOOK TO EXPAND
c1cc0224 THESE INCLUDE SOME MAJOR OIL COMPANIES INTERESTED IN BRAND AWARENESS
c1cc0225 CRITICS ARGUE THAT HE MAY BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC THOUGH
c1cc0226 AND MR. DUKAKIS IS CERTAIN TO FACE MORE PRESSURE ON THE QUESTION FROM VICE PRESIDENT BUSH WHO SUPPORTS THE M. X. AND MIDGETMAN
c1cc0227 MOREOVER MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BEING CONSIDERED AS POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES FOR GOVERNOR DUKAKIS HAVE BACKED ONE OR THE OTHER MISSILE PLANS
c1cc0228 THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL PENDING IN CONGRESS IS EXPECTED TO PUT OFF ANY DECISION UNTIL A NEW ADMINISTRATION TAKES OFFICE NEXT YEAR
c1cc0229 THE POTENTIAL REWARD IS SIMPLY NOT WORTH THE RISK AN A. M. GENERAL SPOKESMAN SAID
c1cc022a IF YOU DID A CASH FLOW CHART IT LOOKED AWFUL UNTIL WAY OUT IN THE FUTURE
c1cc022b UNACCEPTABLY AWFUL
c1cc022c AT THE SAME TIME THE REGION HAS BECOME A MECCA FOR DEVELOPERS ITS RATE OF POPULATION AND JOB GROWTH HAS SLOWED LEAVING SOME MARKETS SEVERELY OVERBUILT
c1cc022d SUCH SUN BELT HOT SPOTS AS ATLANTA NASHVILLE AND PALM BEACH COUNTRY FLORIDA ARE ALL STRUGGLING
c1cc022e IN THE LATTER THE OFFICE VACANCY RATE WAS HIT THIRTY TWO PERCENT AND SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING PERMITS ARE FORECAST TO DROP SEVENTEEN PERCENT THIS YEAR
c1cc022f THAT'S WHAT WALL COVERING INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES DO
c1cc022g LAST WEEKEND AT AN INDUSTRY GATHERING HERE NEARLY FIFTY OF THEM DRESSED UP IN FABRICS DESIGNED FOR BEDROOM BATHROOM AND OTHER HOUSEHOLD WALLS
c1cc022h THEN AFTER A FEW ROUNDS OF DRINKS THEY STAGED A FASHION SHOW FOR HUNDREDS OF GUESTS
c1cc022i AFTER NEARLY EIGHT YEARS OF THE REAGAN PRESIDENCY A KIND OF MORNING AFTER MOOD PREVAILS HERE
c1cc022j THERE IS A SENSE THAT MR. REAGAN'S SUCCESSOR HASN'T ANY CHOICE BUT TO BE A CONSOLIDATION PRESIDENT
c1cc022k GIVEN BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND A RE ENERGIZED CONGRESS SOME HERE BELIEVE A BUSH ADMINISTRATION MAY NOT BE ALL THAT DIFFERENT FROM A DUKAKIS ADMINISTRATION
c1dc0201 MONEY MANAGERS SUCH AS CHASE'S MR. CANTER ALSO APPEARED WILLING TO GIVE THE S. E. C. THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT
c1dc0202 ALL THE BLOCK TRADING ABILITY IN THE WORLD COULDN'T HAVE AVOIDED BIG PRICE DROPS IN SOME OF THOSE STOCKS ONCE THE BOESKY CASE WAS KNOWN HE SAID
c1dc0203 THE WAY THINGS HAVE DEVELOPED SO FAR IS PROBABLY BETTER THAN MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE HAPPENED
c1dc0204 THE BIGGEST DANGER ECONOMISTS SAY IS A FREE FALL OF THE DOLLAR
c1dc0205 THAT WOULD FORCE THE U. S. TO RAISE INTEREST RATES TO ATTRACT THE FOREIGN CAPITAL NEEDED TO FINANCE ITS CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT AND INDIRECTLY ITS BUDGET DEFICIT
c1dc0206 HIGHER RATES IN TURN COULD PLUNGE THE U. S. AND POSSIBLY THE WORLD INTO A RECESSION THAT COULD THREATEN THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM
c1dc0207 LIKE DREXEL MR. ICAHN HAS BEEN SUBPOENAED IN CONNECTION WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S CONTINUING INVESTIGATION OF THE BOESKY SCANDAL
c1dc0208 A SUBPOENA IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND DOESN'T IMPLY ANY WRONGDOING
c1dc020a THE ENERGY CONCERN SAID ITS BOARD MET THURSDAY AND WILL MEET AGAIN SHORTLY
c1dc020b IT SAID IT EXPECTS TO MAKE A FURTHER ANNOUNCEMENT ON THIS SUBJECT EARLY THIS WEEK
c1dc020c IT WOULDN'T ELABORATE
c1dc020d THAT SORT OF HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION HAS LEGAL EXPERTS INVESTMENT BANKERS AND STOCK MARKET INVESTORS TIED UP IN KNOTS THESE DAYS
c1dc020e NICHOLAS BRADY CHAIRMAN OF DILLON READ AND COMPANY SAID IN SENATE TESTIMONY LAST MONTH THAT HE IS CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT IS PERMISSIBLE AND WHAT ISN'T
c1dc020f THERE NEEDS TO BE CLARIFICATION OF EXACTLY WHAT CONDUCT IS TO BE PROHIBITED BY THE CONCEPT OF INSIDER TRADING SAID MR. BRADY
c1dc020g THE BIG PROBLEM IS THAT DOCTOR THANOS CAN NO LONGER USE SO CALLED PASSIVE LOSSES FROM THESE PROPERTIES TO OFFSET HIS SALARY OR EARNED INCOME
c1dc020h THE DISALLOWANCE OF PASSIVE LOSSES IS BEING PHASED IN OVER FIVE YEARS
c1dc020i REAL ESTATE DEPRECIATION SCHEDULES ALSO HAVE BEEN LENGTHENED REDUCING THEIR VALUE
c1dc020j L. A. S. PATIENTS ARE AFFLICTED WITH THE AIDS VIRUS AND SUFFER FROM AN INFLAMMATION OF THE LYMPH NODES
c1dc020k A. R. C. PATIENTS MAY HAVE THE LYMPH CONDITION BUT THEY ALSO SUFFER FROM PRE AIDS AILMENTS THAT MAY INCLUDE SWOLLEN GLANDS FEVERS WEIGHT LOSS AND DIARRHEA
c1dc020l IN BOTH STUDIES PATIENTS RECEIVED SIX HUNDRED OR EIGHT HUNDRED MILLIGRAMS OF VIRAZOLE OR A PLACEBO
c1dc020m MR. WILCOX AS F. P. L.'S CHIEF ECOLOGIST IS THE UTILITY'S POINT MAN FOR THE BIG REPTILES
c1dc020n THIS MORNING HE IS LOBBYING PLANT MANAGERS WHO HAVE JOINED HIM ON THE INSPECTION TOUR TO CREATE BUFFER ZONES AROUND ANY CROCODILE NESTS THEY FIND
c1dc020o BY AFTERNOON THE MANAGERS AGREE
c1dc020p POLAROID STILL MUST REFINE THESE TECHNOLOGIES BEFORE THEY CAN BE USED IN MAJOR CONSUMER SYSTEMS
c1dc020q INITIAL HIGH PRICED COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS USING THE TECHNOLOGIES MIGHT BE AVAILABLE BY NINETEEN NINETY BUT CONSUMER SYSTEMS WILL TAKE LONGER
c1dc020r MOREOVER ANY NEW SYSTEM THAT POLAROID BRINGS TO MARKET ISN'T GUARANTEED SUCCESS BECAUSE OTHER CAMERA COMPANIES ARE WORKING ON ELECTRONIC IMAGING SYSTEMS AS WELL
c1dc020s THE COMPANY SAID IT HAD IDENTIFIED SEVENTY TWO VEHICLES DAMAGED DURING TESTING
c1dc020t THIRTY TWO OF THOSE WERE SCRAPPED OR SOLD AS USED
c1dc020u BUT FORTY WERE REPAIRED AND SOLD AS NEW EVEN THOUGH REPAIRS IN ONE CASE TOTALED NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS
c1dc020v THESE VEHICLES WILL BE REPLACED WITH NEW CHRYSLER MODELS
c1dc020w THE COMPANY SAID IT IS NOTIFYING DEALERS AND OWNERS PARTLY THROUGH A BIG ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN IT PLANS TO KICK OFF TODAY
c1dc020x MANGA FITS NICELY INTO A LIFE STYLE THAT PROVIDES LITTLE TIME OR OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY LIVE ONE'S FANTASIES
c1dc020y FOR EXAMPLE STUDENTS WHOSE DAYS ACTUALLY ARE SPENT STUDYING BECOME COMIC BOOK SECRET AGENTS AND SOLDIERS
c1dc020z AND A FREQUENT MANGA THEME IS A BOY'S LOVE AFFAIR WITH HIS BUXOM TEACHER
c1dc0210 COFFEE FUTURES PRICES ROSE STRONGLY AMID SIGNS THAT CENTRAL AMERICAN COFFEE PRODUCING NATIONS ARE MORE TIGHTLY UNITED IN FAVORING RESTORATION OF COFFEE EXPORT QUOTAS
c1dc0211 THE PRODUCERS BEGAN MEETING FRIDAY IN MEXICO CITY AND CONCLUDED YESTERDAY
c1dc0212 BRAZILIAN AND COLOMBIAN REPRESENTATIVES WERE OBSERVERS AND DIDN'T PARTICIPATE
c1dc0213 AN ANNOUNCEMENT AFTER THE FINAL SESSION SAID THE MEETINGS HELPED CONSOLIDATE THE PRODUCERS POSITIONS REGARDING THE NEED TO REIMPOSE QUOTAS
c1dc0214 THE INTERNATIONAL COFFEE ORGANIZATION'S COUNCIL ITSELF MEETS NEXT WEEK IN LONDON
c1dc0215 SOMETIME LAST MONTH PROTESTS BEGAN SHOWING UP IN THE POLLS
c1dc0216 BOTH DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN POLLSTERS BEGAN NOTICING HUGE DROPS IN PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE TAX AND FOR GOVERNOR MARTINEZ WHO WAS CLOSELY IDENTIFIED WITH IT
c1dc0217 BOTH SIDES BEGAN RUNNING FOR COVER DOING THEIR BEST TO BLAME THE PROBLEMS OF THE TAX ON THE OPPOSING PARTY
c1dc0218 GOVERNOR MARTINEZ NOW SEEMS TO FAVOR REPLACING THE TAX WITH SPENDING CUTS WHILE THE DEMOCRATS SAY INCREASES IN OTHER TAXES WILL ALSO BE NEEDED
c1dc0219 JOHN JENNINGS VICE PRESIDENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS' ASSOCIATION SAID DOCTOR PECK MAY HAVE TWO SCIENTISTS BELOW HIM HANDLING DRUG REVIEW
c1dc021a TWO PORTALS INSTEAD OF ONE HEADED BY TWO FINE SCIENTISTS MAY MEAN SPEEDIER HANDLING OF NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS DOCTOR JENNINGS SAID
c1dc021b BUT IF THAT DOOR IS JUST PAINTED ON HE ADDED IT MAY NOT CHANGE A LOT
c1dc021c AT THE TIME THE AGREEMENT WAS REACHED CARRINGTON'S STOCK WAS TRADING IN THE MID THIRTY DOLLARS TO HIGH THIRTY DOLLAR RANGE
c1dc021d BUT CARRINGTON HAS TAKEN A BEATING SINCE THE STOCK MARKET CRASH OCTOBER NINETEENTH PLUNGING MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT
c1dc021e IN NATIONAL OVER THE COUNTER TRADING CARRINGTON CLOSED YESTERDAY AT SEVENTEEN DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS DOWN TWENTY FIVE CENTS
c1dc021f ASSET ALLOCATORS INSIST THAT ISN'T A DANGER
c1dc021g THE STRATEGIES INVOLVED IN PORTFOLIO INSURANCE REINFORCED THE MARKET'S TREND SAYS PAINEWEBBER'S MR. KIRSCHNER
c1dc021h ASSET ALLOCATION TENDS TO INVOLVE INVESTING AGAINST THE TREND
c1dc021i IF ANYTHING IT SHOULD BE A FORCE FOR STABILITY
c1dc021j DURING ANY REPAIR PROCESS BLOOD CLOTS ARE CONSTANTLY BEING FORMED AND DISSOLVED
c1dc021k IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE SCIENTISTS SPECULATE THAT DURING ATTEMPTS TO REPAIR THE ARTERY WALL THE BODY AT SOME POINT TRIES TO DISSOLVE A BLOOD CLOT
c1dc021l BUT MISTAKENLY GRABS PROTEIN A. INSTEAD OF PLASMINOGEN PULLING IT WITH ITS BAG OF FAT AND CHOLESTEROL INTO THE ARTERY WALL
c1dc021m THIS THWARTS THE REPAIR PROCESS AND BEGINS A VICIOUS CYCLE DRAWING MORE AND MORE CHOLESTEROL INTO THE DAMAGED AREA
c1dc021n AND IN FACT MICROSCOPIC BLOOD CLOTS AND BITS OF L. P. A. ARE FOUND IN THE MISHMASH OF THE DEPOSITS
c1dc021o BUT THERE ARE FAR FEWER K. U. BAND TRANSPONDERS THAN C. BAND TRANSPONDERS OPERATING AND DEMAND FOR K. U. BAND IS GROWING MORE RAPIDLY
c1dc021p CABLE TELEVISION PROGRAMMERS ARE SWITCHING TO K. U. BAND TO TAP A POTENTIAL MARKET OF UP TO FOURTEEN MILLION RURAL HOUSEHOLDS THAT AREN'T WIRED FOR CABLE
c1dc021q IN ADDITION CORPORATIONS SUCH AS K. MART CORPORATION AND PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES ARE BUYING SATELLITE VIDEO AND DATA HOOKUPS BETWEEN FAR FLUNG LOCATIONS
c1dc021r INVESTORS ALSO PREFER REMICS BACKED BY SWAP TEN PERCENT SECURITIES BECAUSE PREPAYMENTS ARE LESS VOLATILE
c1dc021s FREDDIE MAC PASSES THROUGH ACTUAL PREPAYMENTS ON SWAP MORTGAGE ISSUES WHILE IT ESTIMATES PREPAYMENTS ON THE CASH ISSUES
c1dc021t PREPAYMENTS ON FREDDIE MAC CASH ISSUES ARE MUCH MORE VOLATILE FROM MONTH TO MONTH THAN PREPAYMENTS ON THE SWAP ISSUES
c1dc021u ODDLY AND SADLY NEITHER CANDIDATE HAS TALKED MUCH ABOUT THIS ISSUE
c1dc021v MAYBE IT DOESN'T LEND ITSELF TO SLOGANS
c1dc021w MAYBE MESSRS.
c1dc021x BUSH AND DUKAKIS THINK THAT LIKE TAXES IT CRIPPLED WALTER MONDALE FOUR YEARS AGO
c1dc021y MAYBE IT'S AN ISSUE THE CANDIDATES HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT
c1dc021z CLARKE SWANSON NOTING THAT NINETEEN MILLION WOMEN HAD STAYED IN THE WORK FORCE AFTER WORLD WAR TWO THOUGHT THEY COULD USE HELP IN WHIPPING UP QUICK MEALS
c1dc0220 SO IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE THE SWANSON COMPANY BEGAN SELLING FROZEN POT PIES TURKEY CHICKEN AND MEAT
c1dc0221 THE FIRST PRODUCTION ORDER CALLED FOR TWENTY THOUSAND PIES
c1dc0222 SOON IT WAS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND A DAY
c1dc0223 BY NINETEEN FIFTY THREE CLARKE AND HIS BROTHER WERE READY FOR THE NEXT STEP COMPLETE FROZEN DINNERS
c1dc0224 U. S. INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THE TERRORISTS IS CONSIDERED POOR
c1dc0225 IT HAS PROVEN DIFFICULT TO INFILTRATE SMALL TERRORIST CELLS WHICH OFTEN ARE HELD TOGETHER BY FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS
c1dc0226 AND DURING THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES LEBANESE TERRORISTS KILLED TWO OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY'S TOP MIDDLE EAST OPERATIVES ROBERT AMES AND WILLIAM BUCKLEY
c1dc0227 QUITE POSSIBLY A RECENT PROFIT SHARING BONUS HELPED
c1dc0228 WE DON'T HAVE AN ELEGANT FORMULA SAYS MR. BARRON
c1dc0229 WE SAID WE THINK EVERYONE'S ENTITLED TO A SHARE SO HERE'S A CHECK
c1dc022a NEXT YEAR IF WE DO WELL THERE MAY BE A BIGGER CHECK
c1dc022b IS THIS ANY WAY TO RUN A RAILROAD
c1dc022c COULD BE
c1dc022d BUT TROMA WON'T TRY
c1dc022e OUR DESTINY IS A SMALL ONE SAYS MR. KAUFMAN
c1dc022f BUT AT LEAST WE'RE IN CONTROL OF IT
c1dc022g WE ARE EXTREMELY SELECTIVE SAID PAUL SUCKOW DIRECTOR OF FIXED INCOME AT OPPENHEIMER MANAGEMENT CORPORATION
c1dc022h I DON'T THINK SOME ISSUES ARE GOING TO MAKE IT HE SAID
c1dc022j HE SAID HIS FIRM OWNS A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE FEDERATED SENIOR DEBT
c1dc022k ALTHOUGH THE BONDS ARE SECURED BY BANK CREDITS THEY HAVE ALSO FALLEN IN PRICE RECENTLY
c1ec0201 CONTRASTS ABOUND ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CAUSEWAY
c1ec0202 BAHRAINI WOMEN CAN BOARD THE BUS FOR THE TWENTY MINUTE RIDE TO SAUDI ARABIA
c1ec0203 ON THE OTHER SIDE SAUDI WOMEN CANNOT BOARD UNACCOMPANIED BY HUSBAND BROTHER FATHER OR SON
c1ec0204 IN BAHRAIN THE WOMEN CAN DRIVE BUT NOT OVER THE CAUSEWAY TO SAUDI ARABIA WHERE WOMEN AREN'T ALLOWED BEHIND THE WHEEL
c1ec0205 HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
c1ec0206 TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
c1ec0207 THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
c1ec0208 THERE IS A WIDE VARIATION IN THINKING ABOUT HOW SICK ONE IS AND HOW IMPORTANT TIME OFF IS IN ORDER TO GET WELL
c1ec0209 THE PATIENTS' RESPONSIBILITIES OUTSIDE OF WORK ALSO VARY
c1ec020a IT'S HARD TO SAY TO WHAT DEGREE THESE FACTORS SHOULD INFLUENCE DISABILITY STATUS
c1ec020b MOST PHYSICIANS PROBABLY CONSIDER THEM IMPORTANT
c1ec020c TOWLE'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX LOSSES WERE REDUCED IT SAID BY SMALLER INTEREST EXPENSES AND HIGHER GROSS PROFIT MARGINS ON EXISTING PROFIT LINES
c1ec020d BUT TOWLE'S NEGATIVE NET WORTH OR ASSETS MINUS LIABILITIES WIDENED AT DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST FROM ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR EARLIER
c1ec020e THE COMPANY POSTED A NINE MONTH NET LOSS OF FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS ON SALES OF NINETY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
c1ec020f THE DRUG AZIDOTHYMIDINE OR A. Z. T. IS THE FIRST PRESCRIPTION DRUG FOR ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME TO GET FEDERAL FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION APPROVAL
c1ec020g A. Z. T. IS MARKETED UNDER THE NAME RETROVIR BY BURROUGHS WELLCOME COMPANY AT AN ANNUAL RETAIL DOSAGE COST OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
c1ec020h IT ALSO IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROMPTING FEARS THAT SOME INSURERS WHO NORMALLY PROVIDE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE WILL BALK AT ITS PRICE
c1ec020i NOW THE ISSUE IS IN THE HOUSE'S LAP
c1ec020j THE TEMPORARY BAN ON NEW BANKING POWERS IS A PROVISION IN THE SENATE VERSION OF A BILL TO RECAPITALIZE THE INSOLVENT FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN INSURANCE CORPORATION
c1ec020k THE HOUSE F. S. L. I. C. MEASURE DOESN'T HAVE ANY OTHER PROVISIONS
c1ec020m THE ANSWER IS TO SOME EXTENT DEPENDENT ON HOW DESIRABLE ONE FINDS THE TRADITIONAL FAMILY ARRANGEMENT
c1ec020n NEITHER BY INTENT NOR OUTCOME HAS THE SWEDISH MODEL STRENGTHENED THIS PATTERN
c1ec020o INSTEAD IT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO REDUCING BOTH THE FRICTIONS AND THE BONDS OF INTERDEPENDENT FAMILY RELATIONS
c1ec020p THOSE WHO DISAPPROVE OF THE TRADITIONAL FAMILY UNIT MAY FIND THE EMERGING PATTERN OF ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS A WELCOME CHANGE
c1ec020q CHICAGO OFFICIALS HAVE THEIR OWN REASONS FOR FIGHTING THE H. U. D. MOVE
c1ec020r WE DON'T WANT A COMMISSAR RUNNING PUBLIC HOUSING SAYS ALTON MILLER MR. WASHINGTON'S PRESS SECRETARY
c1ec020s IT WOULD BE CRAZY TO HAVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RUNNING WHAT IS IN EFFECT THE SECOND LARGEST CITY IN ILLINOIS
c1ec020t STILL WHATEVER THE RISK OF GARBAGE BURNING THE ALTERNATIVE LANDFILL IS WORSE SAYS MR. MCMANUS THE PUBLISHER OF RESOURCE RECOVERY REPORT
c1ec020u INDEED MANY OLDER LANDFILLS WEREN'T PROPERLY CONSTRUCTED TO CONTAIN THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES NOW LEACHING FROM DECAYING TRASH
c1ec020v IN MANY STATES WATER AND AIR QUALITY IS THREATENED
c1ec020w NEW YORK CITY'S FRESH KILLS LANDFILL ON STATEN ISLAND FOR ONE DUMPS FOUR MILLION GALLONS OF TOXIC LIQUID INTO NEARBY FRESHWATER STREAMS EVERY DAY
c1ec020x HOURS BEFORE THE ARGUMENTS BEGIN LAWYERS AND AIDES REPRESENTING OUTSIDE INVESTORS WILL BEGIN CIRCLING
c1ec020y THEY WILL STAKE OUT CHOICE SEATS NEAR THE EXIT AND PLOT ESCAPE ROUTES TO NEARBY TELEPHONES
c1ec020z ONCE THE HEARING BEGINS THEY WILL HANG ON THE JUDGE'S EVERY WORD
c1ec0210 IT STILL ISN'T CLEAR WHAT FORM THE INCREASES WILL TAKE OR WHEN THEY WILL GO INTO EFFECT
c1ec0211 SOME CARRIERS SAID THEY PLAN TO RAISE FARES SUNDAY AND OTHERS SAID THEY WILL ACT A WEEK LATER
c1ec0212 SOME AIRLINES ALSO SAID THE INCREASES WON'T AFFECT THEIR LOWEST DISCOUNT FARES
c1ec0213 KEMP'S CAMPAIGN TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE TONE
c1ec0215 EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
c1ec0216 BUT HIS LONGTIME HOSTILITIES WITH DOLE LEAVE A SPOT ON A BUSH TICKET AS ABOUT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY
c1ec0217 WHY SHOULD FOREIGN IMPORTS BE A BETTER MEASURE OF U. S. EXPORTS
c1ec0218 AND WHY ARE THE EXPORT DATA SO BAD
c1ec0219 IMPORT DATA ARE DIRECTLY COLLECTED BY A SINGLE GOVERNMENT AGENCY THEY PROVIDE REVENUE FROM TARIFFS AND THEY PROVIDE POLITICALLY IMPORTANT MEASURES OF GOODS SUBJECT TO QUOTAS
c1ec021a THESE ASPECTS OF IMPORT ACCOUNTING ENCOURAGE GOVERNMENT AGENTS TO AMASS ACCURATE IMPORT DATA
c1ec021b CONVERSELY FOR EXPORTS SELF INTEREST INDUCES UNDERREPORTING
c1ec021c MR. GROVEMAN SAID INTEREST RATES ARE THE KEY TO A STRONG STOCK MARKET RALLY
c1ec021d IT'S INESCAPABLE HE SAID
c1ec021e IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE TO EITHER ANTICIPATE BETTER EARNINGS OR PAY MORE FOR CURRENT EARNINGS WE HAVE TO HAVE RATES GO DOWN
c1ec021f TAKEOVERS CAN HELP TRADING WITHIN A RANGE BUT TO BUST OUT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE THE BOND MARKET BUSTING OUT
c1ec021g ADMIRAL CROWE ISN'T DEFENSIVE ABOUT MISTAKES
c1ec021h IF THERE'S ONE PROFESSION IN WHICH YOU CAN'T MOUNT AN ERROR FREE OPERATION IT'S THE MILITARY HE SAYS
c1ec021i IN THIS CASE THE J. C. S. CHIEF FEARED THAT CONGRESS MIGHT CURTAIL THE NAVY OPERATION IF THE U. S. REPEATEDLY LOOKED ILL PREPARED
c1ec021j I HAD REALLY UNDERESTIMATED HOW INVOLVED CONGRESS WOULD GET AND HOW DETERMINED THEY WOULD BE TO POLITICIZE IT HE SAYS
c1ec021k MOST FUNERALS ARE TERRIBLY DIGNIFIED AFFAIRS
c1ec021l DIGNIFIED MUSIC DIGNIFIED WORDS AND FROM THE FLORIST DIGNIFIED FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS
c1ec021m ALMOST AN EXCESS OF DIGNITY YOU MIGHT SAY
c1ec021n LAWRENCE KUDLOW OF BEAR STEARNS AND COMPANY DISAGREES WITH THE NOTION THAT THE ECONOMY HAS ENTERED A RECESSION
c1ec021o BUT HE EQUALLY DISAGREES WITH THE IDEA THAT INFLATION PRESSURES WILL SURGE
c1ec021p ALL THIS TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY OVERHEATING AND HIGHER INFLATION IS COMPLETELY MISPLACED HE SAID
c1ec021q IT'S A SNARE AND A DELUSION
c1ec021r THE SHAREHOLDER DAVID F. LAROCHE A PROVIDENCE R. I. INVESTOR FILED THE SUIT IN A STATE SUPERIOR COURT IN NEWPORT
c1ec021s THE SUIT REQUESTS THE COURT TO ISSUE ORDERS PROHIBITING THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION AND REQUIRING NECO TO HOLD ITS ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS TO ELECT FOUR DIRECTORS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
c1ec021t A SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE DECLINED TO ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER REQUESTED BY THE SUIT TO BLOCK THE ACQUISITION SAID A COURT CLERK
c1ec021u THE U. S. IS SAYING IT'S OVER NOW BUT IS IT OVER FOR THE FAMILIES OF THOSE PEOPLE HE SAID
c1ec021v A SUPERPOWER IS LIKE THE FATHER OF A FAMILY WHOSE BEHAVIOR SHOULD BE A MODEL
c1ec021w BUT IF A SUPERPOWER COMMITS SUCH CRIMES WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED FROM LESSER NATIONS
c1ec021x STANFORD NOW CHOOSES NOT TO REQUIRE ITS UNDERGRADUATES TO STUDY THEIR WESTERN HERITAGE BUT THAT HISTORY DOES YIELD CERTAIN LESSONS
c1ec021y ONE OF THEM IS THAT MINORITIES THAT DO NOT RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO ATTACKS FROM THE MAJORITY MERELY ENCOURAGE FURTHER ASSAULTS
c1ec0220 ADS FOR BREAST IMPLANTS SOMETIMES MAKE THE PROCEDURE LOOK LIKE SOMETHING FUN TO DO ON LUNCH BREAK
c1ec0221 ONE FROM GARY MANCHESTER IN SAN DIEGO SHOWS A FLAT CHESTED YOUNG WOMAN FROM THE NECK DOWN IN A SAGGING BATHING SUIT
c1ec0222 AFTER TWENTY SEVEN YEARS IT SAYS
c1ec0223 IN THE AFTER PHOTO ON THE RIGHT THE BATHING SUIT TOP IS NO LONGER THE LEAST BIT LOOSE
c1ec0224 AFTER ONE HOUR EIGHTEEN MINUTES BOASTS THE AD
c1ec0225 DOCTOR MANCHESTER DISCLAIMS ANY DECEPTION SAYING THAT WAS HOW LONG THE OPERATION TOOK THOUGH THE AFTER PICTURE WASN'T MADE TILL A FEW DAYS LATER
c1ec0226 WORLD OIL PRICES WERE STILL WELL ABOVE THEIR NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX LEVELS YESTERDAY BUT MARKETS REMAINED WEAK NEVERTHELESS
c1ec0227 IN U. S. FUTURES TRADING SPOT MONTH CRUDE OIL SETTLED BELOW FOURTEEN DOLLARS A BARREL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN TWO YEARS
c1ec0228 NOVEMBER WEST TEXAS INTERMEDIATE CLOSED AT THIRTEEN DOLLARS AND NINETY TWO CENTS A BARREL DOWN NINETEEN CENTS
c1ec0229 THEY LIKE MANY DEALERS BLAME V. W.'S DECLINE ON MR. PHILLIPS AND HIS LOW PROFILE STYLE OF MANAGEMENT
c1ec022a BUT JACK PRICE AN ALBUQUERQUE N. M. V. W. DEALER SAID MR. PHILLIPS'S CALM APPROACH HELPED LEAD THE COMPANY THROUGH ITS DIFFICULT TIMES
c1ec022b HIS DEFENDERS ALSO NOTED THAT MANY EUROPEAN AUTO MAKERS HAVE STRUGGLED IN THE U. S. RECENTLY BECAUSE OF THE DECLINING VALUE OF THE DOLLAR
c1ec022c MR. PHILLIPS WAS UNAVAILABLE TO COMMENT ON HIS JOB CHANGE YESTERDAY COMPANY OFFICIALS SAID
c1ec022d STEEL ISSUES STAYED FIRM
c1ec022e NIPPON STEEL MADE SUBSTANTIAL GAINS BROKERS SAID CLOSING AT EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY YEN UP ELEVEN
c1ec022f KAWASAKI STEEL CLOSED FLAT AT NINE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR YEN
c1ec022g IN THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER THE LA JOLLA CALIFORNIA INDUSTRIAL AND INVESTMENT CONCERN HAD A RESTATED LOSS OF FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS
c1ec022h THE RESULTS WERE RESTATED TO REFLECT DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF ITS SIGNAL LANDMARK HOLDINGS INCORPORATED UNIT A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER
c1ec022i REVENUE FOR THE LATEST QUARTER ROSE SIXTY ONE PERCENT TO FOUR HUNDRED SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS
c1fc0201 FRANCE FUND INCORPORATED HAD A NET ASSET VALUE OF FOURTEEN DOLLARS AND FORTY SIX CENTS AND A CLOSING PRICE OF TEN AND ONE EIGHTH AS OF THURSDAY
c1fc0202 GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INCORPORATED HAD A NET ASSET VALUE OF NINE DOLLARS AND THIRTY SIX CENTS AND A CLOSING PRICE OF EIGHT AND SEVEN EIGHTHS AS OF FRIDAY
c1fc0205 IN RECENT YEARS HOWEVER INSIDER TRADING CASES HAVE SOMETIMES INVOLVED PEOPLE WHO ARE QUITE REMOTE FROM COMPANIES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF INSIDE INFORMATION
c1fc0206 SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THE SUPREME COURT HAS SUGGESTED WITHOUT BEING SPECIFIC THAT SUCH CASES MIGHT INVOLVE MISAPPROPRIATION OR ILLEGAL USE OF INFORMATION
c1fc0207 A DECISION IN THE WINANS CASE MAY HELP DEFINE SECURITIES FRAUD BY MISAPPROPRIATION
c1fc0209 HE SAYS PRINTING COSTS TWO DOLLARS AND HE CHARGES ONLY EIGHT DOLLARS FOR THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE PAGE VOLUME WHICH HE UPDATES REGULARLY
c1fc020a HE ESTIMATES HE HAS SOLD ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND COPIES
c1fc020b THE TWO COMPANIES DEVELOPED THE EXPERIMENTAL AIDS VACCINE IN AN EFFORT WITH DUKE UNIVERSITY MEDICAL SCHOOL AND THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH
c1fc020d THE COMPANY HAS SAID IT HOPES TO BEGIN THE TESTS IN THE FALL
c1fc020e REPLIGEN ADDED THAT IT PLANS TO INITIATE DISCUSSIONS WITH POTENTIAL MARKETING PARTNERS FOR THE VACCINE
c1fc020f TO GET ITS MESSAGE TO MADISON AVENUE DECISION MAKERS WHITTLE COMMUNICATIONS HAS BEEN RUNNING A SERIES OF SLICK ADS IN NEWSPAPERS AND MEDIA TRADE JOURNALS
c1fc020g WE'RE WASTING A LOT OF MONEY ON THIS AD ANNOUNCES A BOLD HEADLINE IN ONE
c1fc020i THAT TAKES CARE OF THE FURNITURE
c1fc020j NOW MR. ZHIVKOV SAID HE INTENDS TO LET MARKETS INSTEAD OF ADMINISTRATORS RUN THE ECONOMY
c1fc020l THOSE WHO FAIL WILL FACE BANKRUPTCY AND LAYOFFS
c1fc020q SOLID INVESTMENT BUT INTRIGUING
c1fc020r I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SPRING FOR THAT
c1fc020s THE SUPREME COURT TURNED ITS BACK ON THE BASIC WISDOM OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE LAST APRIL IN THE CASE OF C. T. S. CORPORATION FIVE
c1fc020t DYNAMICS CORPORATION
c1fc020u THIS WAS THE CASE THAT UPHELD INDIANA'S LAW REGULATING CORPORATE TAKEOVERS WHICH WENT MUCH FURTHER THAN FEDERAL LAW TO PROTECT TARGETS AT THE EXPENSE OF BIDDERS
c1fc020v THE RESULT IS A CRUSH OF ANTI TAKEOVER LAWS IN A DOZEN STATES SO FAR
c1fc020w WHAT'S MORE A FURTHER DROP IN THE DOLLAR COULD HAVE THE VERY RESULT MR. BAKER SEEKS TO AVOID HIGHER INTEREST RATES
c1fc020x IN ORDER TO KEEP PERSUADING FOREIGN INVESTORS TO HOLD CHEAPER DOLLARS THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST KEEP U. S. INTEREST RATES HIGHER THAN THOSE ABROAD
c1fc020y AN EVEN WEAKER DOLLAR COULD REQUIRE HIGHER RATES
c1fc020z MR. LAY SAID THE LOSSES OCCURED IN LATE SEPTEMBER AND EARLY THIS MONTH A TIME OF PARTICULAR VOLATILITY IN OIL MARKETS
c1fc0211 THEIR GUESSES WERE WRONG ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MARKET
c1fc0212 FOR THE WALL STREET FIRMS THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS COULD COME MONDAY WHEN SHARES AND CASH OF LAST MONDAY'S TRADES ARE ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO CHANGE HANDS
c1fc0215 BRAZIL UNILATERALLY STOPPED PAYING INTEREST ON AN ESTIMATED SIXTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF FOREIGN BANK DEBT LAST FEBRUARY THE TWENTIETH
c1fc0218 THERE IS ALSO A SECURITIES LAW ISSUE WHICH HAD LED THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION TO FILE AN AMICUS BRIEF ON BEHALF OF TEXACO'S APPEAL
c1fc021b THE S. E. C. SAID THAT THIS PLAINLY VIOLATED RULE TEN B. THIRTEEN
c1fc021c EVEN IF THERE WAS A CONTRACT IT WAS VOID
c1fc021d TEXACO CAN'T BE GUILTY OF INTERFERING WITH A NONEXISTENT CONTRACT
c1fc021e DOCTORS ARE NERVOUS MS. ADAMS SAYS
c1fc021g DOCTORS ARE TRAINED TO DEAL WITH DISEASE NOT HEALTH
c1fc021h IN ADDITION THERE'S GOING TO BE A BIG GLUT IN PHYSICIANS IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS SO THEY'RE GOING TO FIGHT THE COMPETITION
c1fc021j AND SOME CHARGE THAT THERE ARE RACIST ROOTS
c1fc021k THE FACT IS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE SEEING HISPANICS AND ASIANS AROUND SAYS DANIEL GARCIA THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOS ANGELES PLANNING COMMISSION
c1fc021l THE CLEAREST INDICATION OF JAPAN'S BIOTECHNOLOGY AMBITIONS MAY BE THE ATTENTION BEING GIVEN THE FIELD BY THE MINISTRY OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INDUSTRY
c1fc021n THOUGH M. I. T. I. DOES SOME BIOTECH RESEARCH ITS MAIN ROLE IS TO SPUR AND GUIDE WORK BY OTHERS
c1fc021o LIKE A FISHING BOAT TOSSING CHUM IN THE WATER IT FIRST CHARTS A COURSE AND THEN PLANTS MONEY TO ATTRACT MORE
c1fc021p PROFESSOR WILSON SAYS HIS STUDENTS SHOULD NOT HAVE DIVULGED CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION TO THEIR CLIENTS
c1fc021q HE ALSO SAYS THAT AS GRADUATE STUDENTS THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER THEY'LL BE FACING THESE ISSUES EVERY DAY IN THEIR CAREER
c1fc021r THEY HAVE TO LEARN TO DEAL WITH THEM
c1fc021s I TELL THEM TO THINK THROUGH THE TRADE OFFS
c1fc021u THUS MR. PEROT PUT INTO PLAY A CONTRACT THAT E. D. S. HAD HELD EXCLUSIVELY SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN

c1fc0224 WE DO NOT HAVE ANY BENEFITS THAT ARE SKEWED TOWARD THE HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES
c1fc0225 HOWEVER AS SECTION EIGHTY NINE IS WRITTEN WE FAIL THE DISCRIMINATION TESTS TOTALLY
c1fc0226 AS MANY EMPLOYERS ARE THE BIG BROKER IS ENDING A DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN THAT PROVIDED PENSIONS BASED ON SALARY AND YEARS OF SERVICE
c1fc0227 DEFINED BENEFITS HAVE BECOME COSTLIER TO ADMINISTER BECAUSE OF NEW TAX AND ACCOUNTING RULES
c1fc0228 AND EMPLOYEES TEND TO SEE A PENSION YEARS AWAY AS LESS VALUABLE THAN A PAYMENT HERE AND NOW
c1fc0229 ALL OF THIS HAS LED MORE FIRMS TO ADOPT DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN WHICH SALARY AND SERVICE DETERMINE ANNUAL PAYMENTS TO AN EMPLOYEE'S ACCOUNT
c1fc022c ALL OF OUR STUFF SHOWS SAYS FIELD DIRECTOR CHARLIE BAKER THAT IF WE GET OUR MESSAGE OUT WE WIN
c1fc022d THE OFFER IS BEING MADE THROUGH FARLEY INCORPORATED WHICH SAID NO AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE WITH ANY PARTIES TO BUY THE ASSETS IT PLANS TO SELL

c1gc020r IT CLOSED YESTERDAY AT SEVENTY SIX AND THREE EIGHTHS UP ONE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS
c1gc020s THIS REASONING HAS CLEARLY FAILED TO GALVANIZE THE MARKET
c1gc020t MR. LEMING DIDN'T RETURN CALLS SEEKING COMMENT YESTERDAY
c1gc020u MANY OFFICERS AT THE MARINES COMMAND AND STAFF COLLEGE IN QUANTICO VIRGINIA PRIVATELY EXPRESSED CHAGRIN TO A RECENT VISITOR

c1gc020w OLLIE IS TERRIFIC FOR THE MOVIES SAYS ONE YOUNG OFFICER BUT HE'S AN EMBARRASSMENT TO THE CORPS
c1gc020x FOX HAS ALSO STIRRED UP ADVERTISER INTEREST BECAUSE IT HAS PERFORMED WELL IN SOME MARKETS ESPECIALLY BIG CITIES LIKE NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON WHERE IT OWNS AND OPERATES STATIONS

c1gc0219 THE FUND HAS AT LEAST IN PART BEEN DRAINED BY WORKERS TEMPORARILY LAID OFF WHEN PLANTS WERE CLOSED DOWN FOR RETOOLING
c1gc021a ONE REASON THE RATIOS FELL SO SHARPLY IN THE MONTH HE EXPLAINS IS THAT VOLUME DURING OCTOBER SOARED

c1gc021h THE FED APPROVED THE PURCHASE AS IT HAD CLEARED SEVERAL SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING SMALLER BANKS BOUGHT BY GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED FOREIGN INTERESTS IN THE PAST
c1gc021i BUT FED APPROVAL TOOK FIFTEEN MONTHS AND THE BOARD SERVED NOTICE THAT THE LONG ISLAND TRUST CASE INVOLVED SIGNIFICANT AND COMPLEX PROBLEMS

c1gc0222 AND THE SECONDARY MARKET FOR A C. D. CAN PROVE ILLUSORY IF RATES SURGE
c1gc0223 TAIPEI SHARES EXTENDED THEIR LOSSES FOR THE FIFTH DAY FOLLOWING SHARP DECLINES IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
c1gc0224 THE FALL WAS LED BY BANK STOCKS
c1gc0225 OTHER INDUSTRIAL SECTORS HOWEVER RECOVERED FROM RECENT DECLINES
c1gc0226 BUT IT'S WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ALL ABOUT
c1gc0227 THE REAL QUESTION ON THE BALLOT IS SHOULD THE REAGAN YEARS CONTINUE BEYOND THE REAGAN YEARS
c1gc0228 BEYOND THE BUSH YEARS
c1gc0229 BEYOND EVEN THE QUAYLE YEARS
c1gc022a THE SUPREME COURT WILL DETERMINE THAT AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL DETERMINE THE COURT'S MAKEUP FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER GENERATION

c1gc022i YET THE GOVERNMENT LED BY SEVENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD ERICH HONECKER APPEARS ALMOST INCAPABLE OF GOVERNING AT A TIME THAT DEMANDS NEW IDEAS
c1hc0201 WICKES HAD MADE ITS FRIENDLY OFFER FOR LEAR SIEGLER TO HELP ITS SANTA MONICA NEIGHBOR WARD OFF A. F. G. PARTNERS' INITIAL TAKEOVER BID LAST MONTH
c1hc0202 BUT WICKES WHICH HAD SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE LEAR FOR ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS BACKED OFF AFTER HAVING PROBLEMS ARRANGING FINANCING ON SATISFACTORY TERMS
c1hc0203 WICKES HAS DECLINED COMMENT SINCE SAYING THAT IT WAS OFFICIALLY CONTINUING EFFORTS TO ARRANGE FINANCING BUT WASN'T OPTIMISTIC ABOUT ITS CHANCES
c1hc0204 OCCIDENTAL OFFICALS SAY THE MINE WILL START COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS NEXT SEPTEMBER MORE THAN TWO YEARS BEHIND SCHEDULE
c1hc0205 THE MINE IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE BETWEEN THIRTEEN MILLION AND THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION TONS OF STEAMING COAL ANNUALLY USED AT ELECTRIC GENERATING PLANTS SAYS MR. OGDEN
c1hc0206 ALL BUT TEN PERCENT OF THE OUTPUT IS FOR EXPORT MOSTLY TO JAPAN SOUTH KOREA AND HONG KONG

c1hc0208 THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS CLOSED DOWN SEVENTEEN POINT EIGHT FIVE POINTS AT ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN POINT THREE ONE
c1hc0209 MEANWHILE SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES SURGED AS BANKS SCRAMBLED TO BORROW FUNDS TO MEET SEASONAL NEEDS
c1hc020a THE S. E. C. SAYS ITS RULE PROHIBITS SHAREHOLDERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN A TENDER OFFER FROM MAKING ADDITIONAL PROFITS BY SIMULTANEOUSLY SELLING SHORT OTHER STOCK IN THE COMPANY
c1hc020b IN A SHORT SALE A HOLDER SELLS BORROWED STOCK THAT HE AGREES TO REPLACE LATER
c1hc020c IN EFFECT THE HOLDER IS BETTING THAT THE PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK WILL DROP ALLOWING HIM TO PROFIT BY REPLACING THE STOCK WITH CHEAPER STOCK
c1hc020d SUCH RESULTS ARE CAUSING SOME WALL STREET PROFESSIONALS TO TAKE THE JANUARY INDICATOR LESS SERIOUSLY THAN THEY USED TO
c1hc020e I'M PUTTING LESS EMPHASIS ON SOME OF THESE TRADITIONAL BAROMETERS SAYS EUGENE PERONI DIRECTOR OF TECHNICAL RESEARCH FOR JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT INCORPORATED IN PHILADELPHIA

c1hc020i MEANWHILE THE WAR CONTINUES TO DAMAGE THE SOVIETS' THIRD WORLD RELATIONS WHILE DRAINING THEIR ECONOMY AND MILITARY
c1hc020j THE REPORT DOESN'T INCLUDE PRESIDENT REAGAN'S OWN VERSION OF EVENTS
c1hc020k DOES THE PRESIDENT HAVE A VERSION OF THE EVENTS
c1hc020l I DON'T KNOW IF HE DOES SAID MR. MATHES
c1hc020m HE SAID THE WHITE HOUSE WAS PLEASED THAT THE REPORT HAD BEEN RELEASED BECAUSE MR. REAGAN WANTS TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED
c1hc020n MR. WYLIE SAID THE G. O. P. MEMBERS PREFERRED THE HOUSING BILL PASSED BY THE SENATE
c1hc020o THAT BILL WOULD PROVIDE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AUTHORIZATION LEVELS FOR TWO YEARS AND FEWER PROGRAM CHANGES
c1hc020p IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BY ITS SPONSORS AS A HOUSEKEEPING BILL DESIGNED TO GIVE LAWMAKERS MORE TIME TO DEBATE THRUST OF THE NATION'S HOUSING PROGRAMS
c1hc020q SECOND THERE WAS MR. KINNOCK HIMSELF
c1hc020r HIS STRATEGISTS AND POLL TAKERS HAVE LONG KNOWN THAT MOST BRITISH VOTERS HAVE ONLY A FUZZY IDEA OF WHAT KIND OF MAN HE IS
c1hc020s PART OF HIS PROBLEM WAS MRS. THATCHER WHOSE POWERFUL PERSONALITY HAS DOMINATED THE STAGE FOR ALMOST A DECADE
c1hc020t PEOPLE GENERALLY RESPECT MRS. THATCHER BUT NOT MANY REALLY LIKE HER
c1hc020u THE LOAN IS PART OF A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PLAN TO EXPAND THE MINE'S RESERVES AND ALLOW IT TO KEEP OPERATING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY FOUR
c1hc020v WITHOUT THE EXPANSION THE MINE WAS THREATENED WITH CLOSURE NEXT YEAR
c1hc020w CLOSURE WOULD MEAN THE LOSS OF SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTEEN JOBS
c1hc020x AT MOST HIGHFLYING TEXAS THRIFTS A FRIEND OF THE BOSS COULD GET MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON A SIGNATURE
c1hc020y LOANS COULD EXCEED THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE LAND THANKS TO SOME LIBERAL TEXAS S. AND L. LAWS AND COOPERATIVE APPRAISERS

c1hc0210 THE STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF OHIO HAS INVESTED IN REAL ESTATE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND RECENTLY EXPANDED INTO TIMBERLAND
c1hc0211 MOST OF OUR REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO IS IN OFFICE AND RETAIL BUILDINGS SAYS STEPHEN A. MITCHELL DIRECTOR OF INVESTMENTS
c1hc0212 BUT WITH THOSE YOU'VE GOT THE RISK OF LOCATION TENANTS AND THE ECONOMY
c1hc0213 MEANWHILE PRICES HAVE DROPPED DRAMATICALLY IN TIMBERLAND
c1hc0214 SOME CLOSE MOUTHED FRENCH COMPANIES REMIND MR. COATS FOR INSTANCE OF HOW BRITAIN WAS FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS AGO
c1hc0215 HE ALSO SAYS IT TAKES TIME TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF RELATIONSHIPS AMONG MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS AND THE INFLUENCE ON SHARE PRICE BEHAVIOR OF LARGE CROSS HOLDINGS
c1hc0216 THE STRUCTURE OF OWNERSHIP BECOMES QUITE IMPORTANT HE SAYS
c1hc0217 WE SEE MANY OF THOSE WHO BOUGHT WEDNESDAY COMING INTO THE MARKET TO SELL A BROKER SAID YESTERDAY
c1hc0218 TRADERS SAID THERE FEW SELL ORDERS FROM INDIVIDUALS BUT THAT BUY ORDERS FROM CORPORATE INVESTORS HAD GROUND TO A HALT
c1hc0219 THEY PREDICTED THAT THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE SIZABLE SWINGS UNTIL THE MARKET FINDS ITS BALANCE
c1hc021a CERTAINLY FOREIGN COMPETITION AND A CHANGING WORLD ECONOMY HAVE EXACTED A HEAVY TOLL ON OUR NATION'S MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
c1hc021b HOWEVER MANY OF THESE INDUSTRIES HAVE SURVIVED AND ARE NOW AS TOUGH AND LEAN AS THEY'VE EVER BEEN
c1hc021c THE MANAGERS OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE LEARNED THROUGH HARD EXPERIENCE ABOUT EXACTLY WHICH INVESTMENTS PAY OFF
c1hc021d ART COLLECTORS AND DEALERS HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF LAST NIGHT
c1hc021e AFTER HIGH PRICES AND FRANTIC BIDDING AT ART AUCTIONS LAST SPRING ABOUT ONE IN FOUR WORKS DIDN'T SELL AT A CONTEMPORARY ART AUCTION AT CHRISTIE'S
c1hc021f BUT AT LEAST THE MARKET DIDN'T CRASH
c1hc021g THE HUGE GAP TO A LARGE EXTENT IS A PRICE PHENOMENON
c1hc021h THE DOLLAR'S FALL HAS PUSHED UP THE PRICE OF IMPORTS CAUSING THE DEFICIT TO SWELL EVEN AS THE VOLUME OF NON OIL IMPORTS HAS RECEDED
c1hc021i BUT BEFORE LONG NOW THESE HIGHER PRICES WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT IN THE MONTHLY MERCHANDISE TRADE DEFICIT AS WELL
c1hc021j EDGAR S. WOOLARD DU PONT'S PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER NURTURED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE VENTURE
c1hc021k HE SAYS DU PONT IS STILL VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT ITS PROSPECTS BUT HE ACKNOWLEDGES HURDLES THAT MUST BE OVERCOME
c1hc021l THE REAL CHALLENGE HE SAYS IS WHETHER PHILIPS SLASH DU PONT OPTICAL CAN GET THERE AND STAY AHEAD
c1hc021m AMERICAN STANDARD SAID IT IS VERY PLEASED BY BLACK AND DECKER'S WITHDRAWAL
c1hc021n IT DECLINED TO ELABORATE
c1hc021o IF BLACK AND DECKER SHOULD RESUME ITS PURSUIT SOURCES CLOSE TO AMERICAN STANDARD SAID THE COMPANY IS PREPARED TO RESIST AGAIN
c1hc021p DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY'S INDUSTRIAL SALES STAFF IS FIFTEEN PERCENT WOMEN UP FROM TEN PERCENT FIVE YEARS AGO

c1hc021r MCCORMICK AND COMPANY OF HUNT VALLEY MARYLAND SAYS WOMEN ACCOUNT FOR TWENTY NINE PERCENT OF ITS SALES FORCE COMPARED WITH FIFTEEN PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE

c1hc021t NEITHER THE QUIET NOR THE MELLOWING OF ATTITUDES HOWEVER HAS THAWED OFFICIAL RELATIONS BETWEEN JORDAN AND ISRAEL
c1hc021u WITH POLITICAL DIVISIONS IN ISRAEL AND AN ADMINISTRATION NEARING THE END OF ITS TERM IN THE U. S. FEW PEOPLE HOLD OUT MUCH HOPE FOR RECENT PEACE INITIATIVES
c1hc021v THUS ALONG THE RIVER IMPATIENT RESIDENTS HAVE BEGUN THEIR OWN RAPPROCHEMENT
c1hc021w CRITICS ARGUE THAT HE MAY BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC THOUGH
c1hc021x AND MR. DUKAKIS IS CERTAIN TO FACE MORE PRESSURE ON THE QUESTION FROM VICE PRESIDENT BUSH WHO SUPPORTS BOTH THE M. X. AND MIDGETMAN
c1hc021y MOREOVER MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BEING CONSIDERED AS POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES FOR GOVERNOR DUKAKIS HAVE BACKED ONE OR THE OTHER MISSILE PLANS
c1hc021z THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL PENDING IN CONGRESS IS EXPECTED TO PUT OFF ANY DECISION UNTIL A NEW ADMINISTRATION TAKES OFFICE NEXT YEAR
c1hc0220 MR. ZEHNDER PLAYS DOWN THIS CRITICISM
c1hc0223 THE ADDITIONAL SHARES MAY HAVE BEEN BOUGHT IN THE OPEN MARKET OR IN PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS THE FILING SAID
c1hc0224 PENNANT ADDED HOWEVER THAT ITS INTENTION TO RAISE ITS STAKE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE
c1hc0225 A BAY SPOKESMAN DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE FILING
c1hc0226 THE FIRM NEITHER WOULD DISCLOSE HOW MUCH MONEY IT EXPECTS TO SAVE NOR SAY HOW MANY LAYOFFS MIGHT RESULT
c1hc0227 IN SOME CASES WHERE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS WERE MANAGING MORE THAN ONE FUND THEY PROBABLY WILL STAY ON MR. GLASSMAN SAID
c1hc0228 BUT HE SAID NO FINAL DECISIONS HAD BEEN MADE

c1hc022c THERE'S NO QUESTION AFTER A DAY SPENT IDLING ON AN L. A. FREEWAY IT'S POSSIBLE TO FEEL THE EFFECTS OF OZONE
c1hc022d BUT WHAT EXACTLY IS ITS THREAT TO LIFE OR HEALTH
c1hc022e THE BULK OF MEDICAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE EFFECTS OF OZONE WHEEZING COUGHING AND TIGHTENING IN THE CHEST ARE SHORT TERM AND REVERSIBLE
c1hc022f THESE EFFECTS BEGIN AT OZONE LEVELS TWO OR THREE TIMES THE FEDERAL STANDARD THOUGH A FEW STUDIES DETECTED SLIGHT EFFECTS AT JUST ABOVE THE STANDARD
c1hc022g PEOPLE DOING HEAVY EXERCISE WHEN OZONE IS TWO OR THREE TIMES THE STANDARD MAY EXPERIENCE A TEMPORARY LOSS OF LUNG CAPACITY FROM SEVEN PERCENT TO FIFTEEN PERCENT
c1hc022h VARIATIONS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD
c1hc022i THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF RECESSION LIKE DEVELOPMENTS IN THESE STATISTICS SAID NORMAN ROBERTSON CHIEF ECONOMIST AT MELLON BANK CORPORATION
c1hc022j AS A RESULT HE SAID IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THE FED IS GOING TO EASE AT THIS TIME
c1hc022k UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE FED WILL PROBABLY ADOPT A FAMILIAR WAIT AND SEE ATTITUDE
c1ic0201 BOSTON AND SIMILAR MARKETS ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE THOUGH
c1ic0202 GENERALLY ECONOMISTS PREDICT THAT HOME PRICES NATIONWIDE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WILL RISE AT THE MOST ONLY A FEW PERCENTAGE POINTS FASTER THAN INFLATION
c1ic0203 AND IN SOME DEPRESSED REGIONS HOMES ARE ACTUALLY DEPRECIATING <NOISE>
c1ic0204 IN WATERLOO IOWA A FARM EQUIPMENT FACTORY TOWN HOME SELLERS ARE COMPETING WITH BANKS STRUGGLING TO UNLOAD HOMES THEY'VE REPOSSESSED

c1ic021s NOW THE FOCUS WILL BE LESS ON THE EMPTY ROOM AND MORE ON THE PERSONALITY BEHIND IT
c1ic021t WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HERE FOR THIRTY YEARS WHO REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE MOST BASIC JOURNALISTIC PRINCIPLES
c1ic021u THEY DON'T REALIZE THAT NEWS IS PERISHABLE COMPLAINS ONE PROGRAM DIRECTOR
c1ic021v ALMOST ALL R. F. E. SLASH R. L. BROADCASTERS ARE EMIGRES FROM THE SOVIET UNION AND EASTERN EUROPE
c1ic021w MANY ARE OLD OUT OF A WORK FORCE OF ONE THOUSAND IN MUNICH ABOUT TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE WILL RETIRE IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS
c1ic021x MANY ARE CANTANKEROUS INFIGHTING AMONG VARIOUS EMIGRE FACTIONS HAS RESULTED IN COUNTLESS LAWSUITS

c1ic021z WOULD THE ARMED SERVICES ALLOW THEIR TOXIC WASTES TO CONTAMINATE PUBLIC WATER SUPPLIES AND THEN REFUSE TO CLEAN IT UP
c1ic0220 YES SAYS THIS EDITION OF FRONTLINE THAT GIVES MUCKRAKING BACK ITS ORIGINAL MEANING
c1ic0221 MR. GIBBS CONTENDS THAT IMPROVED TAXPAYER SERVICE MUST BE BALANCED WITH A STRONG ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITY
c1ic0222 HE ARGUES THAT TAXPAYERS WILL BE MORE WILLING TO PAY WHAT THEY OWE IF THEY BELIEVE THE I. R. S. WILL CATCH AND PUNISH THE CHEATS
c1ic0223 DISRESPECT FOR THE TAX SYSTEM INCREASES AS PEOPLE FEEL THAT SIMILARLY SITUATED TAXPAYERS AREN'T PAYING THE SAME AMOUNT OF TAX MR. GIBBS SAYS
c1ic0224 THE AGREEMENT CALLS FOR DOVER TO MAKE A TENDER OFFER FOR CHIEF AUTOMOTIVE'S EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
c1ic0225 EACH CHIEF AUTOMOTIVE SHARE THAT ISN'T TENDERED WILL BE CONVERTED INTO A RIGHT TO RECEIVE FIFTEEN DOLLARS IN CASH DOVER SAID
c1ic0226 THE OFFER BEGAN TODAY AND IS SET TO EXPIRE AT MIDNIGHT E. D. T. JULY TWENTIETH
c1ic0227 BUT THE BUSH FAMILY AS A WHOLE GETS HIGH MARKS ON THE STUMP
c1ic0228 AFTER MR. BUSH LOST TO KANSAS SENATOR ROBERT DOLE IN THE IOWA CAUCUSES THE FAMILY RUSHED TO HIS RESCUE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
c1ic0229 THEY HAD BURIED GEORGE BUSH IN THE PRESS RECALLS FORTY TWO YEAR OLD GEORGE BUSH JUNIOR
c1ic022a IT WAS TIME TO RESURRECT HIM
c1ic022b FOR THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THIRD QUARTER THE MAGAZINE GROUP HAD PRETAX EARNINGS OF SIX POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS ON REVENUE OF FIFTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
c1ic022c THE EXPECTED EARNINGS DROP REFLECTS ONE FEWER ISSUE IN THE QUARTER OF FAMILY CIRCLE
c1ic022d ALSO THE COMPANY CITED DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR THREE NEW MAGAZINES
c1ic022e CHEMICAL'S TEXAS COMMERCE BANCSHARES INCORPORATED UNIT REPORTED PROFIT OF SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS
c1ic022f THAT FIGURE INCLUDES A THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLAR GAIN FROM INTERCOMPANY INCOME TAX BENEFITS UNDER THE CORPORATION'S TAX SHARING AGREEMENT
c1ic022g IN THE YEAR AGO QUARTER TEXAS COMMERCE HAD A LOSS OF THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH INCLUDED A SPECIAL CHARGE FROM THE RESTRUCTURING
c1ic022h CHEMICAL ACQUIRED TEXAS COMMERCE IN MAY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
c1jc0201 BUT WHILE EUREKA PROJECTS ARE MORE EASILY APPROVED THE VAGUENESS OF THEIR FUNDING IS ONE REASON MANY EUROPEAN COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE PROGRAM'S VALUE
c1jc0202 ANOTHER IS ITS LOOSE ORGANIZATION WITH NO CENTRAL SYSTEM YET ESTABLISHED FOR CHECKING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS
c1jc0203 MOST OF THE PROJECTS ADOPTED OVER THE PAST YEAR HAVEN'T GOTTEN OFF THE DRAWING BOARD
c1jc0204 INDUSTRY GROUPS ALSO CONTINUE TO PRESS A LAWSUIT TO OVERTURN THE NEW LAW CALLING IT EXCESSIVE REGULATION
c1jc0205 THE LAW WAS MOSTLY UPHELD IN STATE CIRCUIT COURT IN OCTOBER
c1jc0206 THE FLORIDA SUPREME COURT HAS AGREED TO HEAR AN APPEAL
c1jc0207 THE NIGHT BEFORE HE HAD WORKED UNTIL THREE A. M. FILLING THE ROOM WITH HIS EQUIPMENT
c1jc0208 BUT AS HIS MORNING CLASS STARTS HE IS BUBBLING
c1jc0209 COMPUTERS ARE VERY ADDICTIVE
c1jc020a THEY'RE LIKE DRUGS HE PROMISES
c1jc020b IN THE PAST FILIPINOS IN MANY RURAL AREAS PREFERRED THE DISCIPLINED TERROR OF THE N. P. A. TO THE RANDOM EXCESSES OF THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY
c1jc020c WITH THE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT LAST YEAR A MILD IMPROVEMENT IN MILITARY BEHAVIOR AND THE DETECTION OF THE MINDANAO SLAUGHTERS SOME FILIPINOS ARE CHANGING THEIR MINDS
c1jc020d <NOISE> DIPLOMATS AND POLITICAL ANALYSTS SAY THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE TREND PRESAGES SIGNIFICANT POPULAR RESISTANCE TO THE COMMUNISTS OR JUST ADDITIONAL TURMOIL IN THE PHILIPPINE COUNTRYSIDE
c1jc020e MR. KAGLER WOULD BURST OUT OF HIS OFFICE COMMENTING SARCASTICALLY TO SECRETARIES ABOUT COLLEAGUES HE CONSIDERED SLOW MOVING INCLUDING MR. EVERINGHAM
c1jc020f AT FIRST WHAT HE DID WAS STRATEGIC TO PROD EVERINGHAM SAYS ONE OFFICIAL FAMILIAR WITH THE SITUATION
c1jc020g LATER IT WAS FROM SHEER FRUSTRATION
c1jc020h DAYTON HUDSON TUMBLED TWO AND ONE EIGHTH TO FIFTY ONE IN ACTIVE TRADING
c1jc020i THE MINNEAPOLIS BASED RETAILER HAS RECEIVED AN INQUIRY FROM THE HAFT FAMILY OF WASHINGTON WHICH CONTROLS DART GROUP ABOUT ACQUIRING THE COMPANY
c1jc020j MEANWHILE THE MINNESOTA LEGISLATURE IS CONSIDERING ANTITAKEOVER LEGISLATION
c1jc020k PATRICIA MOHR A BANK OF NOVA SCOTIA ECONOMIST SAID SHE EXPECTS THE GROWTH IN CONSUMER SPENDING AND IN HOUSING CONSTRUCTION TO SLOW IN COMING MONTHS
c1jc020l BUT SHE PREDICTED THE SLOWDOWN WOULD BE AT LEAST PARTLY OFFSET BY INCREASED BUSINESS INVESTMENT PARTICULARLY IN AREAS LIKE BRITISH COLUMBIA THAT ARE BENEFITING FROM HIGHER COMMODITY PRICES
c1jc020m THE BANK'S FORECAST IS FOR CANADA TO CONTINUE OUTPERFORMING THE U. S. AND EUROPE OVER THE NEXT EIGHTEEN MONTHS
c1jc020n MR. ZINN SAID ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING IS STILL WEIGHING A PROXY FIGHT
c1jc020o IT'S A BAD FEELING IN YOUR STOMACH WHEN THE CHAIRMAN AND PREVIOUS BIDDER IS SELLING HIS BLOCK HE SAID
c1jc020p IT DOESN'T MAKE ME AS A SHAREHOLDER COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE COMPANY
c1jc020q THREE QUARTER SALES TRAILED THE YEAR EARLIER PERIOD'S ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS A SPOKESMAN SAID
c1jc020r FOR THE YEAR AGO QUARTER SPECTRAN REPORTED A NET LOSS OF THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS
c1jc020s FOR THE FIRST HALF OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN SPECTRAN REPORTED A NET LOSS OF TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS ON SALES OF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
c1jc020t REAGAN SAID HE WOULD LIKE THE SENATE TO VOTE THIS WEEK ON BORK'S NOMINATION TO THE SUPREME COURT
c1jc020u A QUICK VOTE WOULD PERMIT REAGAN TO MOVE AHEAD WITH A NEW NOMINEE IF AS EXPECTED BORK'S CONFIRMATION IS DEFEATED
c1jc020v SENATE LEADERS PLAN TO BEGIN DEBATE ON THE NOMINATION AS EARLY AS TODAY
c1jc020w ADMINISTRATORS BLAME THE HIGH COST OF CARE ON SUCH FACTORS AS RISING SALARIES WHICH THEY SAY ACCOUNT FOR AS MUCH AS SIXTY PERCENT OF EXPENSES
c1jc020x THEY SAY A NATIONWIDE NURSING SHORTAGE FORCES THEM TO PAY BONUSES FOR QUALIFIED HELP
c1jc020y BUT EVEN AT THIS PRICE THERE ARE SHORTCOMINGS
c1jc020z ISRAELI SOLDIERS WOUNDED THREE ARABS IN THE WEST BANK AND GAZA STRIP AS PALESTINIAN YOUTHS STONED CARS AND TORCHED BUSES TO ENFORCE A GENERAL STRIKE
c1jc0210 IN WASHINGTON THE WHITE HOUSE REAFFIRMED ITS SUPPORT FOR EXCHANGING TERRITORY FOR PEACE AS PART OF A MIDEAST AGREEMENT
c1jc0211 ISRAELI PREMIER SHAMIR HAS EXPRESSED OPPOSITION TO THE PLAN
c1jc0212 THE CHANGE ALLOWS LAW FIRMS TO TOUT THEMSELVES AS FULL SERVICE PRACTICES
c1jc0213 THAT COMPLEMENTS CORPORATE PRACTICE SAYS MORRISON COHEN AND SINGER NOTING EXECUTIVES OFTEN WANT LAWYERS INTIMATE WITH THEIR FINANCIAL AFFAIRS TO HANDLE THEIR DIVORCES
c1jc0214 A BIG UPSURGE IN DIVORCES IS EXPECTED AMONG STOCKBROKERS INVESTMENT BANKERS AND TRADERS IN THE WAKE OF THE OCTOBER NINETEENTH CRASH ON WALL STREET
c1jc0215 BUT JAY CHIAT CHAIRMAN OF CHIAT SLASH DAY ISN'T WORRIED
c1jc0216 WE STARTED WITH THE UMBRELLA POSITIONING OF THE CORPORATE NAME AND WE'RE MOVING INTO SPECIFIC PRODUCT AREAS HE SAYS
c1jc0217 WE'RE NOT CHANGING BECAUSE OF ANY SALES SITUATION
c1jc0218 MR. MIGNANELLI MEANWHILE SAYS HE'S BACKING CHIAT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT AND BELIEVES THAT MORE PEOPLE NOW RECOGNIZE THE NISSAN NAME
c1jc0219 ALSO THE TRANSACTION WON'T DISPEL DOUBTS ABOUT HOW MUCH CAPITAL INVESTORS ARE WILLING TO POUR INTO SICK THRIFTS IN THE DEPRESSED TEXAS ECONOMY
c1jc021a THE BANK BOARD HAS SAID POTENTIAL BIDDERS HAVE ONE BILLION DOLLARS TO INVEST IN TEXAS THRIFTS WHICH MAKE UP ALMOST HALF OF THE NATION'S INSOLVENT FEDERALLY INSURED THRIFTS
c1jc021b YET ITS TEXAS THRIFT MERGERS THUS FAR HAVE DRAWN LITTLE NEW CAPITAL
c1jc021c QUARTERLY COMMISSION REVENUE FELL THIRTY TWO PERCENT TO ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS
c1jc021d REVENUE FROM PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS FELL THIRTEEN PERCENT TO EIGHTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS
c1jc021e INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUE ROSE FIVE PERCENT TO SEVENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS WHILE ASSET MANAGEMENT REVENUE ROSE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TO THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS THE COMPANY SAID
c1jc021f THE PLOT IS A TRUE LIFE TALE OF M. C. A. ITSELF AND THE ENDING HAS YET TO BE PLAYED OUT
c1jc021g <NOISE> BUT THE REVELATIONS HAVE ALREADY RAISED EYEBROWS IN HOLLYWOOD WHERE M. C. A. IS CONSIDERED PART OF THE BEDROCK OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY
c1jc021h M. C. A. HAD TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE LAST YEAR OWNS UNIVERSAL STUDIOS AND IS A TELEVISION MUSIC AND REAL ESTATE GIANT
c1jc021i THE COMPANY HASN'T BEEN CHARGED WITH ANY WRONGDOING BUT RECENT PUBLICITY ABOUT ITS TANGLE OF BUSINESS DEALINGS THREATENS AT THE VERY LEAST TO SULLY ITS REPUTATION
c1jc021j MOST IMPORTANT IS THE ATTITUDE MR. LIM SAYS
c1jc021k C. E.'S ATTITUDE IS GOOD
c1jc021l WESTINGHOUSE'S ISN'T
c1jc021m ALTHOUGH WESTINGHOUSE HAS SUPPLIED SIX NUCLEAR PLANTS TO KOREA IT DIDN'T RELEASE THE TECHNICAL SKILLS TO US TO DO IT OURSELVES NEXT TIME
c1jc021n WE BELIEVE THAT C. E. WILL
c1jc021o THE LOWER VOLATILITY COULD BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW WHEN THE COURSE OF INTEREST RATES SEEMS ESPECIALLY CLOUDY
c1jc021p WHILE INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN DECLINING RECENTLY MANY ECONOMISTS EXPECT RATES TO RISE BY YEAR END
c1jc021q AFTER THAT HOWEVER THEY SAY RATES COULD FALL AGAIN PERHAPS SHARPLY AS ECONOMIC GROWTH SLOWS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
c1jc021r ALTHOUGH WEDNESDAY IS THE BIG DAY SOME OF THE HOOPLA IS CARRYING OVER TO THE WEEKEND
c1jc021s TRASH THE CRASH
c1jc021t CASH IN ON THE BASH WILL BE THE THEME OF A SATURDAY PARTY THROWN BY A NEW YORK TELEVISION EXECUTIVE PRODUCER
c1jc021u WEARING A TIE IS OPTIONAL THE INVITATION SAYS BUT IF YOU WEAR ONE IN THE RED TIE ONLY
c1jc021v THOSE EDITORS WHO HAVE PLUNGED IN ARE FINDING THAT AN ELECTRONIC OFFSHOOT CAN HELP THEM PUT OUT A MAGAZINE
c1jc021w BIX USERS HAVE SEEN THEIR ELECTRONIC MUSINGS FIND THEIR WAY INTO PRINT IN BYTE IN A SECTION CALLED BEST OF BIX
c1jc021x NOT LONG AGO BYTE EDITORS WANDERING THROUGH BIX WERE STRUCK BY INSIGHTFUL COMMENTS ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS FROM A SUBSCRIBER IN SAN DIEGO
c1jc021y TODAY THE SUBSCRIBER BROCK MEEKS IS A REGULAR BYTE CONTRIBUTOR ONE OF SEVERAL THE MAGAZINE HAS RECRUITED FROM BIX
c1jc021z THE RICHMOND VIRGINIA MEDIA CONCERN SAID SALES AND PROFITS FROM ITS NEWSPRINT OPERATIONS WERE AHEAD OF YEAR EARLIER LEVELS
c1jc0220 ITS CABLE SYSTEM CONTINUED TO GAIN SUBSCRIBERS NOW TOTALING MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND
c1jc0221 REVENUE PER SUBSCRIBER IS EXCEEDING FORECASTS MEDIA GENERAL SAID ADDING THAT ITS PLANS TO INCREASE RATES AN AVERAGE OF EIGHT PERCENT BEGINNING IN JANUARY
c1jc0222 MR. LEPPO WAS CHIEF MERCHANDISING OFFICER AND EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AT ALLIED FROM AUGUST NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN UNTIL LAST JULY
c1jc0223 HE AND MS. FORTUNE SAID MR. CAMPEAU ENCOURAGED THEM TO BID FOR ANN TAYLOR
c1jc0224 MS. FORTUNE HAS BEEN PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF ANN TAYLOR FOR THE PAST ONE AND ONE HALF YEARS
c1jc0225 IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE AUCTIONS ARE GOING IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN TOKYO SAID MR. PETRI OF MERRILL LYNCH
c1jc0226 NO ONE FIRM CAN DOMINATE THE AUCTION PROCESS THE WAY SALOMON USED TO
c1jc0227 THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE JAPANESE INFLUENCE
c1jc0228 THEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR NATIONAL UNION JOINED THE MARKET
c1jc0229 ITS POLICY FOR STATE JUDGES THE BIGGEST CLIENTS COSTS EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A ONE MILLION DOLLAR POLICY WITH NO DEDUCTIBLE
c1jc022a THE JUDGES ARE COVERED FOR ACTS ERRORS AND OMISSIONS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF PROFESSIONAL DUTIES MR. BOLEN SAYS
c1jc022b CONSUMERS MAY ALSO BE WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER AUTO MAKERS WILL CONTINUE THE GENEROUS INCENTIVES THEY USED ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY OVER THE PAST YEAR TO BUOY SALES
c1jc022c WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THE GOOD OLD BUY IN ADVANCE SYNDROME SAID JOHN QUALLS OF MICRO ECONOMICS LIMITED IN SAINT LOUIS
c1jc022d MR. QUALLS EXPECTS SALES TO SAG BADLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER CAUSING SUPPLIES OF UNSOLD VEHICLES TO RISE UNLESS AUTO MAKERS SHOW CONTINUED RESTRAINT IN PRODUCTION
c1jc022e MR. YEUTTER MEANWHILE SAID THE U. S. IS VIGOROUSLY OPPOSED TO THE E. C.'S CALL FOR A REBALANCING OF TARIFFS ON FARM PRODUCTS
c1jc022f IN EXCHANGE FOR ACCEPTING SOME TARIFF REDUCTIONS THE COMMUNITY WANTS TO BE ALLOWED TO IMPOSE TARIFFS ON PRODUCTS THAT CURRENTLY ENTER THE E. C. DUTY FREE
c1jc022g THESE INCLUDE MAJOR U. S. EXPORTS TO THE E. C. SUCH AS SOYBEANS AND CORN GLUTEN
c1jc022h AS HER LIFE GETS ENMESHED WITH ANDREW'S THESE TWO OLD PALS CARE MORE AND MORE FOR THEIR CORRESPONDENCE WITH EACH OTHER
c1jc022i UNFORTUNATELY IT CANNOT SAVE THEM FROM THE UNHAPPINESS OF THEIR OWN MISTAKES
c1jc022j IN LOVE LETTERS MR. GURNEY ILLUMINATES A PARADOXICAL HUMAN TRUTH LOVE CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE OR IT CAN MAKE NONE AT ALL
c1kc0201 ALARMED BY THE BURN THROUGHS THE F. A. A. ISSUED NEW RULES REQUIRING AIRLINES TO CONDUCT FREQUENT INSPECTIONS OF BURNER CANS
c1kc0202 THE AGENCY ALSO PROHIBITED THE WELDING OF CAN CRACKS LONGER THAN THREE INCHES
c1kc0203 BRITISH AIRWAYS INITIATED AN EVEN TOUGHER POLICY CRACKED CANS AREN'T WELDED THEY ARE REPLACED
c1kc0204 THE AIRLINE ALSO PIONEERED NEW INSPECTION TECHNIQUES TO DETECT CRACKS QUICKLY WITHOUT DISMANTLING THE ENGINE
c1kc0205 THE NEWSPAPER BUSINESS PROSPERS TODAY BECAUSE IT IS WELL MANAGED AND SERVES THE NEEDS OF ITS READERS AND ADVERTISERS
c1kc0206 CARRIERS SHARE ADEQUATELY IN THE PROFIT
c1kc0207 A CARRIER'S PROFIT IS TYPICALLY A PERCENTAGE OF THE NEWSSTAND OR HOME DELIVERY PRICE OF THE PAPER
c1kc0208 WHEN A NEWSPAPER INCREASES NEWSSTAND OR HOME DELIVERY RATES THE CARRIER'S PROFIT IS INCREASED PROPORTIONATELY
c1kc0209 THE TOP MAGNET AREAS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WERE HAWAII ALASKA DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA GEORGIA ARIZONA AND RHODE ISLAND
c1kc020a NEARLY THREE FOURTHS OF ALLIED'S HAWAII BUSINESS CONSISTED OF MOVES TO THE ISLANDS
c1kc020b ALLIED ALSO COUNTS STATES WHERE THERE'S A MARKED EXODUS
c1kc020c FOR THE THIRD YEAR IN A ROW NORTH DAKOTA HAD THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF ALLIED'S OUTBOUND MOVES
c1kc020d OTHER STATES WITH A HIGH SHARE OF OUTBOUND HOUSEHOLDS WERE IOWA WYOMING LOUISIANA AND WEST VIRGINIA
c1kc020e BY AND LARGE OPEC IS PREPARED TO SIT IT OUT SAID A SENIOR OPEC MINISTER WHO ASKED NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED
c1kc020f THERE MAY BE SOME WEAKER MEMBERS AMONG US BUT OPEC AS A WHOLE ISN'T OVERPRODUCING
c1kc020g THE PROBLEM IS SPECULATION BY TRADERS THAT VERGES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE
c1kc020h IN FACT GIVEN THE HIGHLY DEVELOPED U. S. TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE FEW IF ANY SHIPPERS ARE TRULY CAPTIVE TO RAILS
c1kc020i THE BEST CASE IS MADE BY ELECTRIC UTILITIES THAT HAVE POWER PLANTS SERVED BY COAL HAULING ROADS BUT BIG UTILITIES DON'T LACK BARGAINING POWER
c1kc020j FOR ONE THING THE STAGGERS ACT NOW ALLOWS LONG TERM CONTRACTS BETWEEN SHIPPERS AND RAILROADS
c1kc020k THAT INCREDIBLY WAS NOT ALLOWED UNDER THE OLD LAW BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD ONCE DECIDED THAT VOLUME DISCOUNTS TO BIG SHIPPERS WERE UNFAIR
c1kc020l IN DRAWING UP CONTRACTS THE RELEVANT FACT IS THAT BOTH THE RAILROAD AND THE UTILITY NEED EACH OTHER
c1kc020m SOME UTILITIES PARTICULARLY IN THE WEST HAVE SURPLUS CAPACITY MEANING THEY CAN SWITCH TO OTHER SOURCES IF HAULING COSTS AT A SINGLE PLANT RISE
c1kc020n IT IS DUE TO EDUCATION HE SAYS BLOWING SMOKE
c1kc020o WE GIVE YOUNG PEOPLE COMPOSITIONS TO WRITE PICTURES TO DRAW
c1kc020p PEOPLE HAVE COME TO SEE THAT IT IS NOT A GOOD THING TO DRINK TOO MUCH
c1kc020q THE MAY DECLINE WAS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED AT A ZERO POINT SIX PERCENT LOSS
c1kc020r IN APRIL RETAIL SALES ROSE ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT
c1kc020t TO DO THE JOB S. C. I. HAS ASSEMBLED WHAT ANALYSTS CALL A CRACK MANAGEMENT TEAM
c1kc020u PRESIDENT EUGENE SAPP RUNS THE COMPANY ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS AND HE DOES SO IN A NO FRILLS ATMOSPHERE
c1kc020v FOR EXAMPLE COMPANY CARS PLANES AND COUNTRY CLUB MEMBERSHIPS ARE TABOO
c1kc020w UNFORTUNATELY IT WON'T WORK
c1kc020x YOU NEED TO BORROW FROM ABROAD TO FINANCE YOUR NATIONAL BUDGET
c1kc020y WHY SHOULD ANYONE HERE OR ABROAD INVEST IN U. S. GOVERNMENT BONDS IF THE U. S. GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED TO A POLICY OF DEBASING ITS CURRENCY
c1kc020z YOU WILL BE FORCED TO INCREASE YOUR INTEREST RATES AS DO THE ISSUERS OF JUNK BONDS
c1kc0210 AND THEN YOU WILL HAVE A CRASH
c1kc0211 THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR THE NEW STRENGTH IN THE SWEDISH ECONOMY
c1kc0212 SOME OF THEM CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE ECONOMIC POLICIES PURSUED BY OUR GOVERNMENT WHICH IS LED BY THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY
c1kc0213 SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS ARE DUE TO THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY AND THE HALVING OF OIL PRICES
c1kc0214 THE IMPROVEMENT HAS GIVEN SWEDISH POLITICIANS TIME TO CONSIDER WHAT CHANGES ARE NEEDED IN A LONGER PERSPECTIVE TO ENSURE A CONTINUATION OF A FAVORABLE ECONOMIC SITUATION
c1kc0215 TECHNICALLY THE STOPGAP BILL WILL LEAVE THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF MONEY OVER THE WEEKEND
c1kc0216 BUT THAT SHOULD HAVE LITTLE PRACTICAL EFFECT SINCE MOST OPERATIONS WILL BE CLOSED DURING THAT TIME
c1kc0217 CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS HOPE HOWEVER IT WILL PRESSURE LAWMAKERS TO FINISH THEIR WORK BEFORE MONDAY
c1kc0218 FRED M. GIBBONS THIRTY EIGHT RESIGNED AS SOFTWARE PUBLISHING'S CHAIRMAN AND SUCCEEDS MS. BEDKE AS PRESIDENT
c1kc0219 HE ALSO WAS NAMED CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER A POST WHICH WASN'T FILLED WHEN MR. GIBBONS STEPPED DOWN FROM BOTH POSITIONS IN AUGUST
c1kc021a SINCE THEN THE TWO EXECUTIVES HAD BEEN SHARING DAY TO DAY OPERATIONAL MANAGEMENT MR. GIBBONS SAID
c1kc021b HOWEVER SUCH AN AGREEMENT MAY YET OCCUR
c1kc021c THERE'S A LOT BREWING HERE SAID ONE SOURCE CLOSE TO APPLE
c1kc021d THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST OF SEVERAL RELATED ANNOUNCEMENTS AND UNDERTAKINGS
c1kc021e THE SOURCE SAID TECHNICAL AGREEMENTS ARE EASIER TO HAMMER OUT THAN MARKETING AGREEMENTS
c1kc021f ADVANCING ISSUES AND DECLINERS WERE NECK AND NECK YESTERDAY BUT THE HEAVIEST TRADING WAS AMONG THE ISSUES WITH RISING PRICES
c1kc021g SOME FIFTY POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS AT ADVANCING PRICES COMPARED WITH THIRTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION THAT TRADED AT LOWER PRICES
c1kc021h IN ALL A MODERATE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION SHARES TRADED ON NASDAQ YESTERDAY
c1kc021i TODAY'S GAMES RELY ON COMPUTER GENERATED IMAGES
c1kc021j AS COMPUTER CHIPS HAVE BECOME MORE POWERFUL THE IMAGES HAVE BECOME MORE COMPLICATED AND VIVID BUT STILL AREN'T REALISTIC
c1kc021k UNDER DEVELOPMENT HOWEVER ARE GAMES IN WHICH THE PLAYERS INTERACT WITH VIDEOTAPE SCENES
c1kc021l AS FOR THE STICKERS FEW FORD DRIVERS EVEN APPLIED THEM
c1kc021m ONLY ABOUT SEVEN PERCENT DID ACCORDING TO A SPOT CHECK BY THE CENTER FOR AUTO SAFETY
c1kc021n AND FORD NEVER REACHED MORE THAN TWO MILLION OWNERS AT ALL
c1kc021o MANY DEBT HOLDERS SHRUGGED OFF THE F. D. I. C.'S THREAT TO ALLOW FIRST CITY'S BANKS TO FAIL
c1kc021p AT FIRST F. D. I. C. OFFICIALS SUGGESTED THAT WOULD LEAVE CREDITORS EMPTY HANDED
c1kc021q BUT THAT CAME TO LOOK UNLIKELY AS FIRST CITY HAD SOME HEALTHY BANKS AND REGULATORS CAN CLOSE ONLY INSOLVENT BANKS
c1kc021r IF THEY HAD TAKEN OVER THE SICK BANKS CREDITORS MANY OF THEM ARBITRAGERS WHO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PROFIT COULD HAVE PURSUED CLAIMS AGAINST THE SOLVENT ONES
c1kc021s A SIMILAR VIEW IS HELD BY GRETA E. MARSHALL INVESTMENT MANAGER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM WHICH MANAGES ABOUT FORTY FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS
c1kc021t I STILL SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT INFLATION IS PICKING UP SUBSTANTIALLY SHE SAYS
c1kc021u THE ECONOMY DOESN'T LOOK SO STRONG THAT IT WILL REKINDLE INFLATION SO I WOULD VIEW ANY FURTHER DROP IN BOND PRICES AS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY
c1kc021v CRITICS ARGUE THAT HE MAY BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC THOUGH
c1kc021w AND MR. DUKAKIS IS CERTAIN TO FACE MORE PRESSURE ON THE QUESTION FROM VICE PRESIDENT BUSH WHO SUPPORTS BOTH THE M. X. AND MIDGETMAN
c1kc021x MOREOVER MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BEING CONSIDERED AS POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES FOR GOVERNOR DUKAKIS HAVE BACKED ONE OR THE OTHER MISSILE PLANS
c1kc021y THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL PENDING IN CONGRESS IS EXPECTED TO PUT OFF ANY DECISION UNTIL A NEW ADMINISTRATION TAKES OFFICE NEXT YEAR
c1kc021z APOLLO IS THE SECOND LARGEST COMPUTER RESERVATIONS SYSTEM IN THE U. S. BEHIND SABRE
c1kc0220 IN MAY UNITED AGREED TO SELL A HALF INTEREST IN APOLLO TO FOUR EUROPEAN AIRLINES AND U. S. AIR GROUP INCORPORATED FOR NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
c1kc0221 THE TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY REVIEWING THAT TRANSACTION
c1kc0222 BUT THERE IS ALWAYS THE RISK THAT REVIVING A CLASSIC SLOGAN OR SPOKESMAN WILL BACKFIRE AND CREATE AN OLD FASHIONED IMAGE FOR A BRAND
c1kc0223 TO GUARD AGAINST THAT MARKETEERS TEND TO GIVE THEIR RECYCLED ADS A CONTEMPORARY TWIST
c1kc0224 THE CAPTAIN RAID OF NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT FOR EXAMPLE HAS RIPPLING MUSCLES AND A FUTURISTIC LOOK
c1kc0225 AND A WOMAN IN ONE OF THE NEW NESTEA SPOTS DOESN'T JUST TUMBLE INTO A SWIMMING POOL SHE FALLS ONTO AN EXERCISE MAT THAT TURNS INTO A POOL
c1kc0226 THAT SAID MR. QUAYLE HAS CLEARLY SHOWN HE CAN LEARN FAST
c1kc0227 IN TWELVE YEARS IN CONGRESS AND ESPECIALLY FROM HIS ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE POST IN THE SENATE MR. QUAYLE HAS MADE HIMSELF AN INTELLIGENT ADVOCATE OF U. S. DEFENSE
c1kc0228 HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE DETAILS OF STRATEGY HAS LED HIM TO SUPPORT SUCH VALUABLE BUT ARCANE HIGH TECHNOLOGY WEAPONS AS CONVENTIONALLY ARMED CRUISE MISSILES
c1kc0229 THESE HAVE POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE NATO DETERRENCE EVEN AS THEY REDUCE DEFENSE COSTS
c1kc022a OVERALL CONSUMER SPENDING HAS SLOWED SINCE LAST YEAR'S STOCK MARKET CRASH BUT IT'S STILL AT A LEVEL THAT WORRIES SOME ECONOMISTS
c1kc022b CONSUMER CREDIT SLOWED SHARPLY IN JULY REFLECTING SLUGGISH SALES
c1kc022c TOO MUCH SPENDING AT HOME COUPLED WITH HEAVY DEMAND FOR EXPORTS COULD OVERLOAD AN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THAT IS ALREADY RUNNING NEAR CAPACITY
c1kc022d HITLER AND STALIN WERE FRIENDS SAYS AN OLD MAN TURNING IN HIS SEAT TO FACE MR. SEMIONENKOV
c1kc022e ANOTHER WALKS TO THE BACK OF THE BUS
c1kc022f THE POLISH PEOPLE KNEW IT LONG AGO
c1kc022g IT WAS THE RUSSIANS
c1kc022h ONE STUMBLING BOCK TO INCREASED COMPETITION IS THE VERTICAL INTEGRATION AND CROSS OWNERSHIP IN THE INDUSTRY
c1kc022i CABLE SYSTEMS OFTEN HAVE DEMANDED A STAKE IN THE CHANNELS THEY TRANSMIT
c1kc022j AN ENTREPRENEUR IS RELUCTANT TO START AN ALTERNATIVE CABLE SYSTEM IF HE KNOWS THAT HE WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GAIN ACCESS TO PROGRAMMING
c1kc022k QUITE POSSIBLY SOME OF THE ANTITRUST ASPECTS OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS DESERVE A LOOK SO IT CAN BE DETERMINED WHETHER THEY ACT TO FURTHER INHIBIT COMPETITION IN THE INDUSTRY
c1lc0201 DIVERSIFIED ENERGIES INCORPORATED COMPLETED THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF SENIOR NOTES
c1lc0202 THE ENERGY SERVICES CONCERN SAID THE NOTES WERE PLACED WITH A GROUP OF INSURANCE COMPANIES LED BY AETNA LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY A UNIT OF AETNA LIFE AND CASUALTY COMPANY
c1lc0203 THE COMPANY BASED IN MINNEAPOLIS SAID PROCEEDS WILL BE USED TO TO RETIRE REVOLVING BANK CREDIT BORROWINGS OF SEVERAL OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND FOR WORKING CAPITAL
c1lc0204 THE PLACEMENT WAS MANAGED BY KIDDER PEABODY AND COMPANY
c1lc0205 THE TRANSACTION IS SO RISKY THAT PRATT AND WHITNEY A UNIT OF UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION IN EFFECT DROPPED OUT OF THE COMPETITION TO SUPPLY ENGINES FOR THE PLANES
c1lc0206 AS A RESULT GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY IS EXPECTED TO WIN THE ORDER FOR ALL THE ENGINES
c1lc0207 THE ENGINE ORDERS USUALLY ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL OR IN THIS CASE NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
c1lc0208 ONE PROBLEM WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNPOPULAR NEW W. FOUR FORM IS THAT THE I. R. S. FAILED TO TEST IT ADEQUATELY
c1lc0209 IN FACT THE FORM WASN'T SHOWN TO THE PUBLIC AT ALL
c1lc020a IT WAS PRESENTED ONLY TO I. R. S. EMPLOYEES IN TWO OF THE AGENCY'S SERVICE CENTERS
c1lc020b OFFICIALS SUGGEST THAT THESE CLERICAL NON TECHNICAL WORKERS REALLY AREN'T MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC
c1lc020c <NOISE> STILL MR. GIBBS CONCEDES THAT THE AGENCY PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE SOUGHT A WIDER VIEW
c1lc020d JUST WHAT SHUWA HAS IN MIND ISN'T CLEAR
c1lc020e A SPOKESMAN IN THE U. S. SAYS THE IDEA IS TO CREATE A CLEARINGHOUSE FOR THE SALES OF U. S. PROPERTIES BOTH SHUWA'S AND THOSE OWNED BY OTHERS
c1lc020f SHUWA SAYS IT ISN'T AIMING TO SELL TO INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS BUT TO INSTITUTIONS AND LARGE INVESTORS
c1lc020g STILL THE SALES OFFICE IS UNUSUAL FOR INSTITUTIONAL BUSINESS MOREOVER IT WILL BE ON THE GINZA AN ADDRESS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH RETAIL SHOPPING
c1lc020h ME AND THE GUY I WAS WITH WERE FISHING ALONG SOME WEEDS NOT GETTING MUCH OF ANYTHING COOK RECALLS
c1lc020i I HOOKED A BIG ONE AND IT GOT AWAY
c1lc020j I THOUGHT UH OH THAT'S IT FOR ME TODAY
c1lc020l JUST LUCKY I GUESS
c1lc020m AT ONE STAGE EARLY YESTERDAY BEFORE THE DOLLAR HAD RECOVERED THE LATEST THIRTY YEAR TREASURY BOND'S YIELD SURGED TO NEARLY EIGHT AND SEVEN EIGHTHS PERCENT
c1lc020n IT LATER FELL TO EIGHT POINT SIX FOUR PERCENT FROM EIGHT POINT SEVEN PERCENT FRIDAY
c1lc020o AS RECENTLY AS MARCH TWENTY SIXTH THIS ISSUE YIELDED ONLY SEVEN POINT FIVE FIVE PERCENT
c1lc020p PRECIOUS METAL PRICES ALSO STAGED A BIG REVERSAL WITH GOLD PRICES FIRST SOARING THROUGH MIDMORNING AND THEN LATER PLUNGING
c1lc020q THEN THERE ARE UTILITY STOCKS
c1lc020r THE NASDAQ UTILITY INDEX JUMPED EIGHTEEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER WHILE INDEXES OF LISTED UTILITY STOCKS ROSE BARELY THREE PERCENT
c1lc020s BUT IN FACT MOST OF THE FIFTY FIVE ELECTRIC GAS AND WATER UTILITY STOCKS ON NASDAQ PERFORMED MUCH LIKE THEIR COUNTERPARTS ON THE MAJOR EXCHANGES
c1lc020t IT IS A MISSION THAT REMAINS RELEVANT IN THE POST SEGREGATION ERA
c1lc020u MANY CURRENT MOREHOUSE STUDENTS WERE OFFERED SCHOLARSHIPS BY PREDOMINANTLY WHITE SCHOOLS BUT CAME HERE INSTEAD
c1lc020v FOR EXAMPLE ARCHIE RICH A DETROIT PAROCHIAL SCHOOL GRADUATE TURNED DOWN A DIVING SCHOLARSHIP FROM MICHIGAN'S OAKLAND UNIVERSITY IN FAVOR OF MOREHOUSE
c1lc020w I'VE ALWAYS FELT A STRONG RESPONSIBILITY TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY HE SAYS
c1lc020x BUT MEDIATION ISN'T NECESSARILY THE FARMER'S SAVIOR
c1lc020y RECENTLY A PRIVATE BANK STRUCK A HARD BARGAIN WITH A FARMER WHO WAS UNABLE TO MAKE HIS DEBT PAYMENTS
c1lc020z THE FARMER DEEDED BACK HIS FARM TO THE BANK AND KEPT HIS HOUSE AND FOUR ACRES SO HE COULD KEEP A FEW CALVES OR PIGS AND RAISE A GARDEN
c1lc0210 LAST WEEK SALOMON BROTHERS INCORPORATED LAUNCHED ITS SALOMON RUSSELL GLOBAL EQUITY INDEX TRACKING THREE POINT FIVE SIX FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF EQUITIES WORLD WIDE
c1lc0211 THREE SIMILAR MEASURES ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE
c1lc0212 LASZLO BIRINYI JUNIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR SALOMON'S EQUITY MARKET ANALYSIS GROUP SAYS WE'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE RELIABLE CONSISTENT INFORMATION ON GLOBAL SECURITIES
c1lc0213 AND YET THIS HAPLESS FELLOW HAD THE GUTS TO SUE HIS FATHER AND THE AMBITION TO GRAB FOR CONTROL OF THE CORPORATION THAT BEARS HIS NAME
c1lc0214 HE IS MOST ELUSIVE

c1lc0216 WAS HE NAIVELY SEEKING ADVICE OR WAS HE SUBTLY SHOWING THAT HE WAS WILLING TO GO OUTSIDE THE FIRM FOR ALLIES TO OUST THE CURRENT MANAGEMENT
c1lc0217 PERHAPS THE MOST POPULAR DIVERSIONARY TACTIC IS A DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN IN WHICH THE EMPLOYER PUTS MONEY INTO A SEPARATE ACCOUNT FOR THE EMPLOYEE
c1lc0218 COMPARED WITH QUALIFIED PENSION PLANS THESE TRUSTS HAVE SOME DISADVANTAGES
c1lc0219 AN EMPLOYER CAN'T DEDUCT CONTRIBUTIONS TO SUCH A TRUST FROM CORPORATE TAXES AND THE FUNDS AREN'T PROTECTED IF THE COMPANY'S CREDITORS COME LOOKING FOR ASSETS TO ATTACH
c1lc021a OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST WASTE MANAGEMENT'S BOARD MEETS
c1lc021b CHEMLAWN IS DISCUSSED ONLY BRIEFLY AND IS RULED OUT AS A TAKEOVER TARGET BY MR. BUNTROCK
c1lc021c OFFICIALS AT THE COMPANY SAY CHEMLAWN DIDN'T BELONG ON THE AGENDA UNDER PENDING ACQUISITIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE
c1lc021d THE JAPANESE FIRMS INCLUDING OURSELVES HAVE BEEN GOOD MEMBERS OF THE PRIMARY DEALER COMMUNITY SAID TOSHIO MORI CHAIRMAN OF NIKKO'S U. S. UNIT
c1lc021e WE ARE NOT A DISTURBING FORCE IN THIS MARKET AND I DON'T SEE ANY ADVANTAGE IN KICKING THREE JAPANESE FIRMS OUT FROM BEING PRIMARY DEALERS
c1lc021f WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE FOR U. S. MARKETS AND THE U. S. ECONOMY
c1lc021g MR. MAUCHER SAID HE HAD DISCUSSED SOME FORM OF STRATEGIC COOPERATION WITH ROWNTREE'S MR. DIXON FOR THE PAST YEAR
c1lc021h MR. MAUCHER DECLINED TO ELABORATE EXCEPT TO SAY HIS PROPOSALS FELL SHORT OF A TAKEOVER BID
c1lc021i HE SAID HE UNSUCCESSFULLY RAISED THE POSSIBILITY OF COOPERATION AGAIN WITH MR. DIXON AFTER THE JACOBS SUCHARD RAID TWO WEEKS AGO
c1lc021j AT THAT POINT NESTLE DECIDED TO LAUNCH ITS BID MR. MAUCHER SAID
c1lc021k JAMES MAHONEY MR. CARSON'S SPOKESMAN SAYS THE SPLIT WITH MR. BUSHKIN OCCURRED AFTER MR. CARSON DECIDED TO SELL HIS TELEVISION PRODUCTION BUSINESS
c1lc021l THERE AREN'T ANY FINANCIAL IRREGULARITIES HE SAYS

c1lc021t ARTHUR YOUNG LATE LAST MONTH FIRED THE PARTNERS AND SUED TO ENJOIN THEM FROM STEALING CONSULTING CLIENTS AND LURING AWAY PERSONNEL
c1lc021u THE PARTNERS FORMED A NEW CONSULTING FIRM TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS INCORPORATED BASED IN CHICAGO WHICH HAS OFFERED TO BUY ARTHUR YOUNG'S CONSULTING PRACTICE FOR FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS
c1lc021v ARTHUR YOUNG DECLINED THE OFFER
c1lc021w FOR THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THIRD QUARTER THE MAGAZINE GROUP HAD PRETAX EARNINGS OF SIX POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS ON REVENUE OF FIFTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
c1lc021x THE EXPECTED EARNINGS DROP REFLECTS ONE FEWER ISSUE IN THE QUARTER OF FAMILY CIRCLE
c1lc021y ALSO THE COMPANY CITED DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR THREE NEW MAGAZINES
c1lc021z IN THE POSITION I'M IN I COULD RAISE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY IN TEN DAYS MORE THAN I WOULD NEED HE SAYS
c1lc0220 BUT I WON'T DO IT
c1lc0221 I WOULD BE DEFEATED BEFORE I WOULD ACCEPT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS
c1lc0222 BUT FREEDOM ISN'T AN ACCIDENT
c1lc0223 IT IS THE RESULT OF PAINSTAKING WORK TO MAINTAIN THE STRUCTURE OF LIBERTY AGAINST INEVITABLE EROSION AT THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNMENT
c1lc0224 I THOUGHT THAT MY WORK FOR THE A. C. L. U. WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF MAINTAINING FREEDOM FOR EVERYONE
c1lc0225 I NOW CONFESS MY ERROR AND EMBRACE LEADER BUSH'S PERCEPTION THAT THE A. C. L. U. IS A POLITICALLY SUSPECT LIBERAL CONSPIRACY
c1lc0226 RYAN SEEMED FREE FROM DRUGS AND MORE LIKE HIS OLD SELF
c1lc0227 HE CLOSELY FOLLOWED THE NEWS AND DISCUSSED THE SUPREME COURT NOMINATION OF ROBERT BORK WITH MORE FACTS THAN EVEN HIS FATHER THE JOURNALIST WAS UP ON
c1lc0228 CORRECTING ME HE WOULD QUIP I THINK I KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS THAN YOU DO
c1lc0229 DURING THAT CAMPAIGN AS IN EARLIER ONES A FEW LOW AND MIDDLE RANKING OFFICIALS WERE ARRESTED OR DISMISSED
c1lc022a BUT NO LEADING CADRES OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS WERE PUNISHED FUELING CYNICISM AMONG THE MASSES
c1lc022b AND THE CORRUPTION PROBLEM SEEMED ONLY TO GET WORSE
c1lc022c THE APPOINTMENT CONTINUED TO LANGUISH AND ON JUNE FIRST DOCTOR SULLIVAN CALLED MR. FULTON AND SUGGESTED THAT HE WITHDRAW HIS NAME FROM CONSIDERATION
c1lc022d DOCTOR SULLIVAN HAD CONCLUDED THAT EVEN IF HE PUSHED THE FULTON NOMINATION THROUGH THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE SENATE THE PRICE OF VICTORY WOULD BE TOO HIGH
c1lc022e HE WOULD HAVE INCURRED THE WRATH OF THE RIGHT TO LIFE MOVEMENT AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ENEMY MR. FULTON SAYS
c1lc022f THE FED REPORT GAVE NO HINT THAT MAKERS OF CAPITAL EQUIPMENT EXPECT DEMAND FOR THEIR WARES TO FALL OFF
c1lc022g PRODUCTION OF BUSINESS EQUIPMENT THOUGH REDUCED BY THE DROP IN AUTO AND TRUCK PRODUCTION GREW ZERO POINT TWO PERCENT IN JULY AFTER REMAINING FLAT IN JUNE
c1lc022h THE FED ATTRIBUTED THE INCREASE TO STEPPED UP PRODUCTION OF COMMERCIAL AND FACTORY EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS AIRCRAFT
c1lc022i OUTPUT OF INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS ALSO REBOUNDED IN JULY AFTER DROPPING FOR TWO MONTHS
c1mc0201 RICHARD MACDONALD AN ANALYST AT FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION SAID THE RESULTS WERE IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS
c1mc0202 THE IMPRESSIVE THING IS THE IMPROVEMENTS THEY'VE MADE IN COST SAVINGS HE ADDED
c1mc0203 FOR EXAMPLE TIME RECENTLY SAID IT WOULD DO AWAY WITH ITS MAGAZINE DEVELOPMENT GROUP A MOVE MR. MACDONALD SAID COULD SHAVE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL COSTS
c1mc0204 WE HAD TO SCOUR THE EARTH TO ACHIEVE THAT SETTLEMENT MR. LIEBMANN SAID
c1mc0205 BUT THROUGH IT ALL RALPH WAS CALM AND RATIONAL
c1mc0206 HE DOESN'T PANIC WHEN THINGS START TO GO WRONG
c1mc0207 IN FRANKFURT PRICES CLOSED MIXED TO HIGHER IN LIVELY TRADING
c1mc0208 STOCKS OPENED MUCH FIRMER BUT WERE BROUGHT LOWER BY A WAVE OF PROFIT TAKING
c1mc0209 ELECTRONICS COMPANIES SIEMENS NIXDORF AND A. E. G. ALL CLOSED HIGHER
c1mc020a AUTO MAKERS WERE MIXED WITH DAIMLER BENZ CLOSING SLIGHTLY DOWN BUT VOLKSWAGEN B. M. W. AND PORSCHE RISING
c1mc020b ENERGY EXPERTS CONSIDER AMOCO AND EXXON AMONG THE INDUSTRY'S HEALTHIEST COMPANIES FINANCIALLY WITH STRONG CREDIT RATINGS AND LOW DEBT
c1mc020c AMOCO'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHOW IT HAD FOUR HUNDRED FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES ON HAND AT THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX

c1mc020e L. A. S. PATIENTS ARE AFFLICTED WITH THE AIDS VIRUS AND SUFFER FROM AN INFLAMMATION OF THE LYMPH NODES
c1mc020f A. R. C. PATIENTS MAY HAVE THE LYMPH CONDITION BUT THEY ALSO SUFFER FROM PRE AIDS AILMENTS THAT MAY INCLUDE SWOLLEN GLANDS FEVERS WEIGHT LOSS AND DIARRHEA
c1mc020g IN BOTH STUDIES PATIENTS RECEIVED SIX HUNDRED OR EIGHT HUNDRED MILLIGRAMS OF VIRAZOLE OR A PLACEBO
c1mc020h THESE CRITICISMS ARE OVERWROUGHT AND UNCONVINCING
c1mc020i WHILE PRIVATE OPERATORS WILL CERTAINLY LOBBY IN THEIR OWN INTEREST IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT THEY COULD MANIPULATE PUBLIC OPINION AND LAWMAKERS AS EASILY AS THEIR OPPONENTS SUGGEST
c1mc020j NOR IS IT CLEAR THAT PRIVATE PRISON OPERATORS WOULD HAVE TO LOBBY FOR HARSHER SENTENCES
c1mc020k GIVEN CURRENT LEVELS OF OVERCROWDING AND PUBLIC SENTIMENT IN FAVOR OF STRICTER SENTENCING THERE WILL BE NO SHORTAGE OF INMATES TO FILL NEW FACILITIES
c1mc020l FLOATING FAILS WHEN GOVERNMENTS TRY TO ESCAPE FROM THE VERDICT OF THE EXCHANGE MARKETS ON THEIR POLICIES BY RESORTING TO DIRECT CONTROLS OVER TRADE AND CAPITAL FLOWS
c1mc020m BECAUSE THIS LATTER THREAT IS NOW SO SEVERE THE WORLD IS RIGHT TO TALK ABOUT INTERNATIONAL MONETARY REFORM IF ONLY AS A DELAYING GAME
c1mc020n BUT IDEALISTIC TALK SHOULD NOT DECEIVE STABILIZING EXCHANGE RATES REQUIRES DEPENDENCE AND SUBORDINATION NOT THE FREEDOM FOR EVERYBODY TO DO THEIR OWN THING
c1mc020o DREXEL SAID THREE MILLION ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND SHARES WERE SOLD TO THE PUBLIC AND THE REST WERE SOLD TO THOMAS H. LEE A COMPANY DIRECTOR
c1mc020p THE COMPANY SOLD ALL OF THE SHARES

c1mc020v HOSTILE TAKEOVERS ARE ALMOST UNHEARD OF IN THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY
c1mc020w BUT ANALYSTS HAVE SPECULATED THAT EITHER FORD MOTOR COMPANY OR GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY MIGHT BE A GOOD FIT WITH BOEING IF THE COMPANIES WERE INTERESTED
c1mc020x FORD FOR INSTANCE HAS INDICATED IT IS LOOKING FOR ACQUISITIONS AND HAS ACCUMULATED ABOUT NINE BILLION DOLLARS IT COULD USE FOR SUCH PURPOSES
c1mc020y A FORD SPOKESMAN CITING COMPANY POLICY WOULD NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY SPECULATION ABOUT ITS INTEREST
c1mc020z G. E. DECLINED COMMENT BUT A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE COMPANY SAID IT ISN'T INTERESTED IN BOEING
c1mc0210 WE ARE AWARE OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS AND WE WILLINGLY ACCEPT THEM THE BANKER OBSERVES
c1mc0211 BUT THE BUNDESBANK HE ASSERTS HAS TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS IN SETTING ITS MONETARY POLICY
c1mc0212 FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW WE ALREADY HAVE A PERMISSIVE POLICY HE SAYS
c1mc0213 BIDS TOTALING THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS WERE SUBMITTED
c1mc0214 ACCEPTED BIDS RANGED FROM SEVEN POINT ONE FIVE PERCENT TO SEVEN POINT ONE SEVEN THREE PERCENT

c1mc021g ITS SHAREHOLDERS INCLUDE SOME OF THE NATION'S LARGEST PENSION FUNDS
c1mc021h C. P. I. ISN'T INVOLVED WITH THE LITIGATION BUT SOME OF ITS SHAREHOLDERS WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY LOVE TO SLOW DOWN THE ACTIVITY IN LEVERAGED TAKEOVERS
c1mc021i SENATOR BENTSEN'S CORPORATE TAX PROPOSAL WOULD REPLACE A PROVISION IN THE COMMITTEE BILL ALLOWING THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE TO WITHHOLD REFUNDS FROM TAXPAYERS WHO HAVE DEFAULTED ON GOVERNMENT LOANS
c1mc021j THIS PROVISION WOULDN'T RAISE ANY MONEY IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AND SENATOR BENTSEN WANTED SOMETHING THAT WOULD ALLOW A QUICKER END TO THE DIESEL TAX COLLECTION
c1mc021k THE TEXAS DEMOCRAT PLANS TO OFFER HIS SUBSTITUTION WHEN THE TAX PACKAGE REACHES THE SENATE FLOOR
c1mc021l S. D. I. DESPITE WHAT THE DEFENSE LUDDITES SAY IS NOT AN ADVENTURE IN TECHNOLOGY APPLICATION
c1mc021m IT IS A TOOL OF NATIONAL POLICY AND AS WITH ANY TOOL IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE USED WITH A SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE IN MIND
c1mc021n THE OBJECTIVE LEST WE FORGET IT IS TO PREVENT A GLOBAL NUCLEAR WAR
c1mc021o A SIMILAR VIEW IS HELD BY GRETA E. MARSHALL INVESTMENT MANAGER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM WHICH MANAGES ABOUT FORTY FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS
c1mc021p I STILL SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT INFLATION IS PICKING UP SUBSTANTIALLY SHE SAYS
c1mc021q THE ECONOMY DOESN'T LOOK SO STRONG THAT IT WILL REKINDLE INFLATION SO I WOULD VIEW ANY FURTHER DROP IN BOND PRICES AS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY
c1mc021r AT ANOTHER NEWS CONFERENCE IN WASHINGTON TEXAS AIR CHAIRMAN FRANK LORENZO EXULTED OVER THE DEPARTMENT'S CONCLUSIONS THAT EASTERN AND CONTINENTAL ARE SAFE
c1mc021s BOTH AIRLINES PASSED INSPECTION WITH FLYING COLORS HE SAID

c1mc0227 COMMERCIAL CLUTTER SEEMS GREATER THAN IN PREVIOUS OLYMPICS BROADCASTS MANY CRITICS SAY
c1mc0228 THE COVERAGE BETWEEN ADS SOME COMPLAIN IS FRAGMENTED AND SHIFTY JUMPING TOO QUICKLY AMONG MYRIAD SPORTS

c1mc022a MANY HEADLINE EVENTS DON'T APPEAR UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT
c1mc022b FRANKFURT SHARE PRICES CLOSED MOSTLY LOWER IN MODERATE ACTIVE TRADING FRIDAY AS AN EARLY RALLY FIZZLED AMID POSITION SQUARING BEFORE THE WEEKEND AND UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE LOWER DOLLAR
c1mc022c THE D. A. X. INDEX DROPPED FIVE POINT FOUR NINE TO ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE POINT SEVEN TWO

c1mc022h THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THERE IS A BUSINESS DILEMMA RAISED HERE
c1nc0201 TO CURB DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION AND SALVAGE THE TRADE SURPLUS BRAZIL'S ECONOMIC PLANNERS RECENTLY IMPOSED A TOUGH PACKAGE OF TAX AND PRICE INCREASES
c1nc0202 THE RESULT BRAZILIANS LAST WEEK RIOTED IN THE STREETS OF BRASILIA IN THE WORST VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL IN ITS TWENTY SIX YEAR HISTORY
c1nc0203 AND A GENERAL STRIKE HAS BEEN TENTATIVELY SET FOR DECEMBER TWELFTH
c1nc0204 EDWARD YARDENI CHIEF ECONOMIST AT PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES INCORPORATED IN NEW YORK SAID THE SURPRISING SURGE IN NONRESIDENTIAL BUILDING IS A REASON FOR CONCERN

c1nc020h AT FRANKLIN FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT HALF A DOZEN PEOPLE HANDLE THE PAPERWORK ASSOCIATED WITH MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT OF THE THRIFT'S ASSETS

c1nc020w IT TRADITIONALLY HAS SOLD ITS FUNDS THROUGH DIRECT MARKETING TECHNIQUES SUCH AS NEWSPAPER AND MAGAZINE ADVERTISING BACKED BY A TELEPHONE NETWORK

c1nc020y AS A MANAGER MR. O'MALLEY CONCEDES HE PUSHES SUBORDINATES TO WORK LONG AND HARD HOURS IF NECESSARY
c1nc020z BUT AS A BOSS I PICK MY SPOTS TO BE TOUGH HE ADDS

c1nc0214 THE RESULT A BOOMING ECONOMY AT A TIME WHEN ITS MAJOR TRADING PARTNERS ARE STRUGGLING TO ACHIEVE GROWTH
c1nc0215 THE JAPANESE BUILT ONE POINT SIX MILLION NEW HOMES LAST YEAR THE MOST SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE
c1nc0216 THAT IN TURN HAS TRIGGERED A SURGE IN DOMESTIC DEMAND THAT IS CROWDING STORES AND FORCING FACTORIES TO INCREASE PRODUCTION
c1nc0217 RESIDENTS HERE SAY ONE MIGHT EXPECT SUCH GOINGS ON IN MIAMI OR FORT LAUDERDALE BUT NOT IN SLEEPY WINTER HAVEN
c1nc0218 THE BIGGEST SCAM IN RECENT MEMORY WAS A RABBIT BREEDING SCHEME THAT LURED LOCALS INTO BUYING AND RAISING BUNNIES FOR PELTS IN THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES

c1nc021d STOCK MARKET PROFESSIONALS WERE STUNNED BY THE PESSIMISTIC RESPONSE THAT INVESTORS GAVE THE TRADE REPORT
c1nc021e MANY OF THEM HAD COUNTED ON A BIG STOCK PRICE RALLY IF THE MARCH DEFICIT CAME IN UNDER TEN BILLION DOLLARS
c1nc021f NOW ABOUT ALL THEY CAN SEE ARE FURTHER PRICE DECLINES
c1nc021g THE POINT A POINT MR. CAMPBELL KEEPS RETURNING TO IS THAT EVERY RELIGION IS TRUE
c1nc021h IT'S TRUE AS A METAPHOR FOR THE HUMAN AND COSMIC MYSTERIES

c1nc021w BUT NATWEST THEN PUSHING TO DISLODGE BARCLAYS AS BRITAIN'S TOP COMMERCIAL BANK WAS MORE RELUCTANT TO COMMIT ITSELF TO A SIMILAR POSITION IN INVESTMENT BANKING
c1nc021x THAT SAID MR. QUAYLE HAS CLEARLY SHOWN HE CAN LEARN FAST
c1nc021y IN TWELVE YEARS IN CONGRESS AND ESPECIALLY FROM HIS ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE POST IN THE SENATE MR. QUAYLE HAS MADE HIMSELF AN INTELLIGENT ADVOCATE OF U. S. DEFENSE
c1nc021z HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE DETAILS OF STRATEGY HAS LED HIM TO SUPPORT SUCH VALUABLE BUT ARCANE HIGH TECHNOLOGY WEAPONS AS CONVENTIONALLY ARMED CRUISE MISSILES
c1nc0220 THESE HAVE POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE NATO DETERRENCE EVEN AS THEY REDUCE DEFENSE COSTS
c1nc0221 FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS THE KURDS HAVE STRUGGLED TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT KURDISTAN IN A TERRITORY THAT STRADDLES PARTS OF TURKEY IRAQ AND IRAN

c1nc022c SALES ARE STILL UNDER TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR HE SAYS BUT THEY'RE HEADED UP
c1nc022d INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SMALL MEDICAL BILLS IS ESPECIALLY WASTEFUL
c1nc022e USUALLY IT WILL COST AN INSURER MORE THAN FIFTY DOLLARS TO MONITOR EFFECTIVELY A FIFTY DOLLAR PHYSICIAN BILL THEREBY DOUBLING THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE
c1nc022f BUT FAILURE TO MONITOR ENCOURAGES PATIENTS AND DOCTORS TO MAKE WASTEFUL DECISIONS WITHOUT FEAR OF THIRD PARTY SCRUTINY

c1oc020h PER SHARE EARNINGS FOR THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX QUARTERS BENEFITED FROM THIRTY SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF GOOD WILL AMORTIZATION IN EACH PERIOD
c1oc020i THE GOOD WILL AMORTIZATION REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT ABOVE BOOK VALUE THAT G. M. PAID FOR HUGHES AIRCRAFT
c1oc020j THAT ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT REPRESENTS A CHARGE AGAINST G. M.'S EARNINGS
c1oc020k THE SENATE APPROVED A NINE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL FOR FISCAL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WHICH WAS AMENDED TO REQUIRE IMMIGRANTS TO UNDERGO AIDS TESTING
c1oc020l IT WAS PASSED SEVENTY ONE TO TWENTY THREE
c1oc020m THE AMENDMENT WAS THE FIRST CONGRESSIONAL BACKING FOR MANDATORY SCREENING FOR THE DISEASE
c1oc020n THE SKIRMISHING SOMETIMES FLARES INTO OPEN BATTLE
c1oc020o IN EARLY JANUARY THE VIETNAMESE SAY CHINESE FORCES ATTACKED IN REGIMENTAL STRENGTH SENDING HUMAN WAVES ACROSS THE BORDER
c1oc020p HANOI SAID IT KILLED ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CHINESE
c1oc020q BEIJING SAID IT KILLED AND WOUNDED FIVE HUNDRED VIETNAMESE IN REPULSING AN ATTACK
c1oc020r IN THE END THERE IS LITTLE THE U. S. CAN DO TO CONTROL EVENTS IN SOUTH AFRICA
c1oc020s THE ADMINISTRATION'S SIX YEAR CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT POLICY DESIGNED TO COAX PRETORIA TOWARD DISMANTLING APARTHEID DIDN'T SUCCEED
c1oc020t AND SANCTIONS IN THE SHORT RUN WON'T DAMAGE SOUTH AFRICA'S SELF RELIANT ECONOMY
c1oc020u BUT THE PERCEPTION OF INACTION HAS DIPLOMATIC COSTS FOR THE U. S. AND SO FOR THE TIME BEING SANCTIONS SEEM TO BE THE BEST BET
c1oc020v RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
c1oc020w THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT
c1oc020x THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
c1oc020y THE SURVEY'S COMPOSITE INDEX FELL TO FIFTY EIGHT POINT NINE PERCENT IN NOVEMBER FROM OCTOBER'S SIXTY ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT
c1oc020z A FIGURE ABOVE FIFTY PERCENT INDICATES THAT THE ECONOMY IS GENERALLY EXPANDING
c1oc0210 NOVEMBER MARKS THE SIXTEENTH CONSECUTIVE MONTH OF EXPANSION
c1oc0211 MY CABDRIVER EYES ME IN HIS REAR VIEW MIRROR
c1oc0212 HIS REACTION SEEMS A LITTLE HOSTILE BUT I DON'T CARE I AM FEELING POSITIVELY VICE PRESIDENTIAL
c1oc0213 I AM ABOUT TO BECOME GEORGE BUSH FOR A NIGHT
c1oc0214 YOU CAN TOO
c1oc0215 ANYBODY CAN FOR A PRICE
c1oc0216 SHORT SELLERS NOW ARE SETTING THEIR SIGHTS ON SEVERAL OF THE BIG BLUE CHIP ISSUES THAT MAKE UP THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE
c1oc0217 THE QUESTION IS WHEN TO GO SHORT ON THE BLUE CHIPS MR. MURPHY SAYS
c1oc0218 I THINK MAYBE WHEN THIS RALLY ENDS TOWARD THE END OF JANUARY
c1oc0219 THIS HEADY MIXTURE OF PIETY AND GUTTER FIGHTING WE FEAR IS LIKELY TO DETRACT FROM CAUSES WE WOULD LIKE TO ADVANCE
c1oc021a THIS IS PERFECTLY ILLUSTRATED BY MR. ROBERTSON'S CHARGE THAT THERE ARE RUSSIAN INTERMEDIATE RANGE MISSILES IN CUBA
c1oc021b IT IS PERFECTLY TRUE THAT THE I. N. F. TREATY GIVES US NO RIGHTS TO INSPECT FOR MISSILES IN THE SOVIET'S ISLAND SATELLITE
c1oc021c AND IT IS TRUE THAT SOVIET BASES THERE ARE A DANGER TO THE U. S.
c1oc021d BUT TO POSE THESE VALID ISSUES IN THE MOST INFLAMMATORY WAY MR. ROBERTSON HAS CHARGED THAT THE MISSILES ARE ALREADY DEPLOYED AND IN PLACE
c1oc021e IF THIS IS PRESENTED AS THE ISSUE THE ANSWER IS NO AND THE VALID POINTS ARE LOST
c1oc021f THE TEAM SAYS THIS KIND OF ACTION PROTECTS ITS VALUABLE PLAYERS FROM ABUSE
c1oc021g JOEY KNOWS HIS ROLE SAYS COACH DEMERS
c1oc021h HE CITES THE TIME A SAINT LOUIS PLAYER SWUNG HIS STICK AT A RED WING NOT KNOWN FOR HIS FIGHTING SKILLS
c1oc021i I TOLD JOEY TO GO OUT THERE AND TELL HIM NOT TO DO IT AGAIN SAYS THE COACH
c1oc021j THE MESSAGE GOT THROUGH IF NOT NECESSARILY IN WORDS
c1oc021k NOW HOWEVER IT APPEARS INCREASINGLY LIKELY THAT MONSIEUR MITTERRAND WILL DISSOLVE THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND CALL A NEW ELECTION
c1oc021l POLLS SHOW THAT THE SOCIALISTS HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF WINNING AN ABSOLUTE MAJORITY IF ELECTIONS WERE HELD NOW ENABLING MESSRS.
c1oc021m MITTERRAND AND ROCARD TO GOVERN WITHOUT RELYING ON THE CENTRISTS
c1oc021n OTHER PRIVATE WEST GERMAN BANKS SUCH AS DRESDNER BANK A. G. AND COMMERZBANK A. G. RANKED SECOND AND THIRD IN WEST GERMANY HAVE BEEN LESS ACTIVE
c1oc021o IN MAY DRESDNER BANK BOUGHT A MAJORITY STAKE IN THORNTON AND COMPANY A LONDON BASED FUND MANAGER WITH ASSET MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS IN ASIA
c1oc021p EVERYONE HAS THE SAME GOAL BUT IN DIFFERING DEGREES SAYS AN EXECUTIVE AT A LARGE FRANKFURT BANK
c1oc021q BANKS THAT COMMIT TO THE NEW CREDIT BY TODAY GET A FEE EQUAL TO ZERO POINT THREE SEVEN FIVE PERCENT OF THE AMOUNT THEY COMMIT
c1oc021r IT WON'T BE CLEAR UNTIL AFTER THE WEEKEND HOW MANY COMMITMENTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED
c1oc021s BUT SOME BANKERS CLOSE TO THE TRANSACTION ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OR SLIGHTLY MORE THAN FOUR BILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE COMMITTED BY EARLY NEXT WEEK
c1oc021t THE DISPUTE IS A CLASSIC CONFRONTATION BETWEEN MARKET PHILOSOPHIES
c1oc021u WASHINGTON BELIEVES THAT JAPAN PROFITS FROM FREE U. S. MARKETS AND SHOULD RECIPROCATE WITH COMPLETELY FREE JAPANESE MARKETS
c1oc021v TOKYO GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS CLAIM TO FAVOR FREE MARKETS IN PRACTICE THEY OFTEN ARE LOATH TO RELINQUISH COMPLETE CONTROL ESPECIALLY IN PROMISING INDUSTRIES
c1oc021w I'D NEVER OWNED A SHARE NEVER EVEN KNEW WHAT A DIVIDEND OR THE STOCK EXCHANGE IS HE SAYS
c1oc021x NOW I FOLLOW PRICES EVERY DAY IN THE PAPER
c1oc021y WHEN I COMPARE WHAT I HAVE TO WHAT I HAD IN NINETEEN SEVENTY I HAVE NO DOUBT I WILL VOTE YES HE SAYS
c1oc021z ALL OF THIS HAS STRATEGISTS BACK IN TOKYO WORRYING
c1oc0220 AS AMERICA HAS DROPPED OUT OF MANUFACTURING TELEVISIONS IT HAS ALSO LARGELY ABANDONED TELEVISION RESEARCH
c1oc0221 IF THIS KEEPS HAPPENING IN ONE INDUSTRY AFTER ANOTHER WHERE WILL THE SEEDS OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES COME FROM
c1oc0222 AT LEAST SOME OF THEM WILL HAVE TO SPROUT AT HOME IN JAPAN
c1oc0223 LAST WEEK HOUSE AND SENATE NEGOTIATORS SETTLED ON THE HOUSE FINANCING PLAN
c1oc0224 BUT WHEN THE HOUSE SENATE COMPROMISE WAS TAKEN UP ON THE HOUSE FLOOR YESTERDAY A LETTER FROM PRESIDENT BUSH WAS WAITING
c1oc0225 IF THE CONFERENCE REPORT IS PRESENTED TO ME IN ITS CURRENT FORM HE WROTE I WILL VETO THE BILL
c1oc0226 THE GUIDE LOOKS DOWN AND PULLS AT HIS SOCKS
c1oc0227 LATER HE SAYS WHEN THE RUSSIANS LIBERATED SMOLENSK A NEW COMMISSION FOUND GERMAN BULLETS IN THE SKULLS OF THE OFFICERS
c1oc0228 AND THE METHOD BY WHICH THEY WHERE SHOT IN THE BACKS OF THE HEADS WAS A GERMAN METHOD
c1oc0229 AND THEY FOUND GERMAN WEAPONS
c1oc022a THAT IS WHY THE RUSSIANS SAID IT WAS DONE BY THE NAZIS IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE
c1oc022b AND THAT IS EVERYTHING I KNOW
c1oc022c C. F. T. C. OFFICIALS WILL BE GRILLED SEPTEMBER EIGHTH WHEN THEY PRESENT THEIR PRELIMINARY FINDINGS TO THE SENATE AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE
c1oc022d SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY D. VERMONT THE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF QUESTIONING THE AFFILIATED DIRECTORS FURTHER
c1oc022e THE PUBLIC WILL NOT TOLERATE SELF DEALING OR CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BY EXCHANGE DIRECTOR OR INSIDERS HE SAID FRIDAY IN A STATEMENT
c1oc022f MR. KIDDER INSISTS THERE IS CAUSE FOR HOPE
c1oc022g GOOD TEACHERS PUT SNAGS IN THE RIVER OF CHILDREN PASSING BY AND OVER THE YEARS THEY REDIRECT HUNDREDS OF LIVES
c1oc022h PERHAPS HE IS RIGHT
c1oc022i BUT WHAT HE NOTICES AT THE FIFTH GRADE SCIENCE FAIR SEEMS MORE SIGNIFICANT
c1oc022j THE RESULTS OF THAT PAINFUL CHARADE DON'T REFLECT SOCIAL STATUS ETHNIC BACKGROUND OR TEACHING TECHNIQUE THEY REFLECT THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF EACH CHILD'S PARENTS

c1pc020d LICENSES FOR TWO OF THE TELEVISION STATIONS AND ALL THE RADIO STATIONS ARE BEING CHALLENGED BY GROUPS WHO CHARGE THAT GENCORP IS AN UNFIT OPERATOR
c1pc020e THE DISPUTE INCLUDES ALLEGATIONS THAT GENCORP FAILED TO ADEQUATELY INFORM THE F. C. C. OF ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND FOREIGN PAYMENTS
c1pc020f THAT'S TOO MUCH SHE SAYS
c1pc020g I'M AN IMMIGRANT IN THIS COUNTRY WITH NO ROOTS
c1pc020h ALL I BROUGHT WITH ME WAS MY DIGNITY MY PRINCIPLES AND MY NAME
c1pc020i MY PARENTS GAVE ME THAT NOT SONY CORPORATION

c1pc020k I HAVE TRUST IN HIM
c1pc020l I CHOSE HIM DIDN'T I
c1pc020n IN ADDITION G. E. WILL TAKE CONTROL OF KIDDER'S BOARD SHRINKING IT TO TWENTY ONE MEMBERS FROM TWENTY THREE AND REMOVING NINE KIDDER EXECUTIVES INCLUDING MR. ROCHE

c1pc020x DEAN THREW PLANTS IN FOUR STATES INTO HIGH GEAR AROUND THE CLOCK
c1pc020y DELIVERY TRUCK DRIVERS WORKED THIRTEEN HOUR SHIFTS WITH JEWEL EMPLOYEES RIDING SHOTGUN TO HELP FIND UNFAMILIAR STORES
c1pc020z DEAN EVEN YANKED ITS SUPERVISORS FROM BEHIND THEIR DESKS TO PILOT MILK TRUCKS
c1pc0210 WHETHER WE'RE ALL SAFE AND HAPPY NOW OR NOT THERE IS THE FUTURE TO THINK ABOUT
c1pc0211 WHATEVER THE PROBLEMS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE A GREAT DEAL TO MAKE FREE MARKETS AND LIBERALISM RESPECTABLE
c1pc0212 WILL THE GAINS DISAPPEAR WHEN MR. REAGAN LEAVES OFFICE
c1pc0213 BRAZIL UNILATERALLY STOPPED PAYING INTEREST ON AN ESTIMATED SIXTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF FOREIGN BANK DEBT LAST FEBRUARY TWENTIETH

c1pc0219 RORER GROUP WHOSE STOCK EASED THREE EIGHTHS TO THIRTY FIVE AND THREE QUARTERS SAID IT SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE A. H. ROBINS
c1pc021a THE AGREEMENT IS A KEY PART OF ROBINS'S BANKRUPTCY REORGANIZATION PLAN
c1pc021b ROBINS JUMPED ONE AND ONE HALF TO TWENTY ONE
c1pc021c THE REFUSAL OF NEARLY HALF OF THE NATION'S ELIGIBLE VOTERS TO GO TO THE POLLS EXERTS A MAJOR INFLUENCE ON THE WAY POLITICIANS RUN FOR OFFICE
c1pc021d A HO HUM CITIZENRY PROMPTS CANDIDATES TO EMPHASIZE BLAND EPHEMERAL CLAIMS OF VISION AND LEADERSHIP RATHER THAN SPECIFIC ISSUES
c1pc021e SUCH ISSUE LESS CAMPAIGNING IN TURN MAKES IT HARD FOR THE WINNERS TO CLAIM SWEEPING POPULAR MANDATES WHEN THEY REPORT FOR WORK
c1pc021f WHY SHOULD FOREIGN IMPORTS BE A BETTER MEASURE OF U. S. EXPORTS
c1pc021g AND WHY ARE THE EXPORT DATA SO BAD
c1pc021h IMPORT DATA ARE DIRECTLY COVERED BY A SINGLE GOVERNMENT AGENCY THEY PROVIDE REVENUE FROM TARIFFS AND THEY PROVIDE POLITICALLY IMPORTANT MEASURES OF GOODS SUBJECT TO QUOTAS
c1pc021i THESE ASPECTS OF IMPORT ACCOUNTING ENCOURAGE GOVERNMENT AGENTS TO AMASS ACCURATE IMPORT DATA
c1pc021j CONVERSELY FOR EXPORTS SELF INTEREST INDUCES UNDERREPORTING
c1pc021k THE JOURNAL NEVER CAN BE ALL THINGS TO ALL READERS
c1pc021l IT DOESN'T TRY TO BE
c1pc021m WE ARE NOT PLANNING SPORTS SECTIONS OR LOCAL NEWS COVERAGE COLORED WEATHER MAPS OR STORIES ON EVERY MINOR CRISIS IN THE WORLD
c1pc021n WE DO INTEND TO REMAIN AMERICA'S NATIONAL BUSINESS DAILY AND WITH OUR EXPANDING ASIAN AND EUROPEAN EDITIONS THE GLOBAL BUSINESS DAILY AS WELL
c1pc021o THAT MEANS FOCUSING FIRMLY ON NEWS THAT BUSY BUSINESS PEOPLE TRULY NEED
c1pc021p FORD'S FOURTH QUARTER SALES WERE EIGHTEEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS UP FIFTEEN PERCENT FROM SIXTEEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR EARLIER
c1pc021q FULL YEAR SALES ROSE FOURTEEN PERCENT TO SEVENTY ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS FROM SIXTY TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS

c1pc021v SWISS OFFICIALS SAY INDONESIA HASN'T REQUESTED HELP
c1pc021w IF IT WAS TO DO SO JAKARTA WOULD HAVE TO SHOW THAT THE MONEY WAS ILLEGALLY ACQUIRED
c1pc021x SWISS BANKERS SAY THE BEST WAY TO RECOVER THE MONEY IF IT EXISTS WOULD BE FOR DOCTOR SUBANDRIO TO AUTHORIZE THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT TO ACT ON HIS BEHALF
c1pc021y BUT IF HE CAN'T RECALL THE CODE NAMES AND NUMBERS FOR THE ACCOUNTS THEN INDONESIA ISN'T LIKELY TO SUCCEED
c1pc021z AT FIRST THE REBELS TRIED TO STRUGGLE ALONG WITH THEIR HOME GROWN MULES
c1pc0220 BUT THESE ANIMALS WERE A SCRAWNY LOT BY AMERICAN STANDARDS AND WHEN THEY WEREN'T WORKED TO DEATH THEY WERE GUNNED DOWN BY THE SOVIETS
c1pc0221 THE TURKS WERE NEARBY BUT THEY ALSO HAD INFERIOR MULES
c1pc0222 THE CHINESE CHARGED OUTLANDISH RATES FULLY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MULE
c1pc0223 THE EGYPTIANS WERE QUICKLY DRAINED OF THEIR SUPPLY
c1pc0224 THE U. S. WAS THE REBELS' LAST BEST HOPE
c1pc0225 MR. WOLF WHO IS ALSO CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF UNITED WOULDN'T DISCUSS THE AIRCRAFT ORDERS IN AN INTERVIEW YESTERDAY
c1pc0226 <NOISE> BUT HE SAID HE ISN'T SURE THAT EVEN THE ONE POINT SIX DOLLARS SPENDING BILLION PLAN IS ADEQUATE BUT HE SAID HE ISN'T SURE THAT EVEN THE ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS SPENDING PLAN IS ADEQUATE
c1pc0228 MS. LIU HAD HER FIRST CHILD A BOY TWO YEARS AGO
c1pc0229 SHE WAS URGED NOT TO HAVE ANOTHER
c1pc022a SHE WAS EASY TO DEAL WITH THE PARTY SECRETARY BOASTS
c1pc022b MR. MINOLI THE U. S. GENERAL MANAGER SAYS BENETTON RECENTLY DROPPED ITS STRATEGY OF SATURATING THE MARKET WITH SMALL STORES
c1pc022c NOW IT IS CONCENTRATING ON PROFESSIONALISM AND THE SERVICING OF EXISTING STORES HE SAID
c1pc022d NEW STORES WILL BE LARGER OUTLETS CALLED UNITED COLORS THAT WILL OFFER A MUCH BROADER RANGE OF MERCHANDISE
c1pc022e BENETTON PLANS TO HAVE TEN UNITED COLORS SHOPS OPERATING IN THE U. S. BY NEXT SPRING
c1pc022f MR. MINOLI ALSO ESTIMATES THAT AS MANY AS ONE HUNDRED SMALLER BENETTON STORES MAY CLOSE IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS
c1pc022g THE OPERATION WAS A PIRATE
c1pc022h THEY HAD OPENED WITHOUT OUR BLESSING SAYS ROBERT EARL PRESIDENT OF THE U. S. OPERATIONS
c1pc022i WE BROUGHT IN OUR DISCIPLINE AND NOW IT'S DOING EXCEPTIONALLY WELL
c1pc022j MR. EARL NOTES THAT THE HARD ROCK IN TOKYO HAS A LARGE KING KONG FIGURE ON THE SIDE OF ITS BUILDING AND DRAWS MOSTLY AMERICANS
c1qc0201 EARLY IN THE DAY TRADERS WERE EXPECTING THE KIND OF LATE AFTERNOON REBOUND THEY SAW THE PREVIOUS TWO SESSIONS
c1qc0202 INSTEAD THE MARKET WHICH BEGAN THE DAY DOWN MORE THAN FIVE POINTS CONTINUED TO SINK UNDER THE WEIGHT OF PROGRAM TRADING
c1qc0203 PROGRAMS ARE TRIGGERED BY PRICE DISPARITIES BETWEEN STOCK INDEX FUTURES AND THE UNDERLYING ISSUES
c1qc0204 THE NEWSPAPER BUSINESS PROSPERS TODAY BECAUSE IT IS WELL MANAGED AND SERVES THE NEEDS OF ITS READERS AND ADVERTISERS
c1qc0205 CARRIERS SHARE ADEQUATELY IN THE PROFIT
c1qc0206 A CARRIER'S PROFIT IS TYPICALLY A PERCENTAGE OF THE NEWSSTAND OR HOME DELIVERY PRICE OF THE PAPER
c1qc0207 WHEN A NEWSPAPER INCREASES NEWSSTAND OR HOME DELIVERY RATES THE CARRIER'S PROFIT IS INCREASED PROPORTIONATELY
c1qc0208 HOW IS WALL STREET REACTING TO THE CHANGES
c1qc0209 SOME INVESTMENT BANKERS FEEL THREATENED BY IT OTHERS SCOFF AT SUGGESTION THAT THESE EFFORTS ARE TRULY COMPETITIVE
c1qc020a BUT SOME SAY THE CASE ISN'T CLEAR
c1qc020b FEW DEVELOPERS ARE BIG ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THE COST OF THESE DIVISIONS
c1qc020c THE TEST WILL BE WHETHER THE NEW UNITS ARE ADDING VALUE TO THEIR ORGANIZATIONS
c1qc020d IF NOT ONE INVESTMENT BANKER SAYS THE PARTNERS WILL KILL THEM
c1qc020e WE HAD TO SCOUR THE EARTH TO ACHIEVE THAT SETTLEMENT MR. LIEBMANN SAID
c1qc020f BUT THROUGH IT ALL RALPH WAS CALM AND RATIONAL
c1qc020g HE DOESN'T PANIC WHEN THINGS START TO GO WRONG
c1qc020h SUDDENLY ONE OF THE MAMMOTH MACHINES TILTS FORWARD
c1qc020i OUT TUMBLE FORTY EIGHT PAIRS OF LEE JEANS
c1qc020j PLUS FIFTY POUNDS OF PUMICE STONES
c1qc020k A TEAM OF WORKERS MOVES IN QUICKLY TO SHAKE PUMICE FRAGMENTS FROM THE DAMP JEANS
c1qc020l THREE OTHER BORDER CITIES ACCUSTOMED TO HARD TIMES HAVE BEEN ADDING JOBS AT A PACE WELL ABOVE THE STATE AVERAGE
c1qc020m EL PASO'S EMPLOYMENT ROSE THREE PERCENT IN THE YEAR ENDING IN JANUARY
c1qc020n IN LAREDO AND BROWNSVILLE HARLINGEN JOB GROWTH WAS TWO PERCENT
c1qc020o FOR TEXAS AS A WHOLE EMPLOYMENT WAS ESSENTIALLY FLAT IN THE SAME PERIOD
c1qc020p ALL THREE OF THESE BORDER COMMUNITIES HAD UNEMPLOYMENT RATES IN TWO FIGURES
c1qc020q DEMOCRATS HAVE THE CREDIBILITY ON THE BUDGET ISSUE ASSERTS KIRK O'DONNELL PRESIDENT OF THE CENTER FOR NATIONAL POLICY A DEMOCRATIC THINK TANK
c1qc020r NOW THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE RECORD
c1qc020s FAILURE TO COME THROUGH WITH A DEFICIT CUTTING PLAN HE ADDS WOULD MEAN AN OPPORTUNITY LOST
c1qc020t NO DOUBT MR. CHUN KNOWS HE HAS TO STEP DOWN
c1qc020u BUT THE POINT HERE IS THAT HE IS TRYING TO ARRANGE IT SO THAT HE WILL STILL WIELD THE REAL POWER FROM BEHIND THE SCENES EVEN AFTER HIS RESIGNATION
c1qc020v HIS REPEATED EXPRESSIONS OF HIS WILLINGNESS TO STEP DOWN MUSTN'T BE SEEN AS AN EFFORT TO USHER IN SOME GENUINE DEMOCRATIC CHANGE IN KOREA
c1qc020w WHAT KOREA IS NOW SUFFERING TO OVERCOME IS MAINLY A POLITICAL NOT ECONOMIC PROBLEM
c1qc020x REFORMS THAT DO NOT CHANGE THE PRESENT POLITICAL SYSTEM ARE NOT REFORMS
c1qc020y MORE TRADITIONAL ACADEMICS SAY MANY OF THE NEWER JOURNALS ARE MERELY PLATFORMS FOR MARGINAL SCHOLARS TO WRITE ON TRIVIAL TOPICS
c1qc0210 BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE WHO PUBLISH SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT WOULDN'T WANT TO PUBLISH IN THE LEADING JOURNALS
c1qc0211 COFFEE FUTURES PRICES ROSE STRONGLY AMID SIGNS THAT CENTRAL AMERICAN COFFEE PRODUCING NATIONS ARE MORE TIGHTLY UNITED IN FAVORING RESTORATION OF COFFEE EXPORT QUOTAS
c1qc0212 THE PRODUCERS BEGAN MEETING FRIDAY IN MEXICO CITY AND CONCLUDED YESTERDAY
c1qc0213 BRAZILIAN AND COLOMBIAN REPRESENTATIVES WERE OBSERVERS AND DIDN'T PARTICIPATE

c1qc0215 THE INTERNATIONAL COFFEE ORGANIZATION'S COUNCIL ITSELF MEETS NEXT WEEK IN LONDON
c1qc0216 MR. CHEN LEFT CRAY IN SEPTEMBER AFTER IT SCRAPPED HIS LATEST DESIGN PROJECT WHICH IT TERMED TOO COSTLY AND SPECULATIVE
c1qc0217 MR. CHEN WAS CONSIDERING USING LASERS RATHER THAN WIRES IN THAT MACHINE
c1qc0218 BUT WHILE CRAY GRANTED MR. CHEN PERSONAL NONEXCLUSIVE USE OF HIS DEVELOPMENTS THERE HIS NEW COMPANY SAID IT DOESN'T INTEND TO USE CRAY TECHNOLOGY
c1qc0219 HE KEEPS RIVALS GUESSING
c1qc021a IN SEPTEMBER MR. MAXWELL BEGAN BUYING SHARES IN GUINNESS PEAT GROUP P. L. C. AS A NEW ZEALAND INVESTOR GROUP WAS GAINING CONTROL
c1qc021b THE NEW ZEALANDERS WITH FORTY PERCENT OF THE SHARES TWICE REBUFFED HIS OVERTURES
c1qc021c NEVERTHELESS HE DECLARED ON T. V. THAT HE JUST MIGHT BUY GUINNESS PEAT LOCK STOCK AND BARREL
c1qc021d A FEW DAYS LATER HAVING AROUSED MANY PEOPLE'S INTEREST HE RENOUNCED THAT INTENTION
c1qc021e BROKERAGE SOURCES SAID JAPANESE INVESTMENT TRUSTS ENTERED THE MARKET IN THE AFTERNOON TO HELP NUDGE SHARE PRICES HIGHER FOLLOWING THE MORNING DECLINE
c1qc021f SOME PHARMACEUTICAL STOCKS AND BLUE CHIP ELECTRICAL ISSUES SURGED
c1qc021g TRADERS THEORIZED THAT INVESTMENT TRUSTS WERE TRYING TO RALLY THE MARKET WITH THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF MAJOR SECURITIES HOUSES TO FORESTALL A SERIOUS DECLINE IN ADVANCE OF THE LONG HOLIDAY WEEKEND
c1qc021h THE EXCHANGE WAS CLOSED SATURDAY AND IS CLOSED MONDAY FOR A NATIONAL HOLIDAY
c1qc021i THE BONDS ARE NONCALLABLE
c1qc021j BONDHOLDERS HAVE THE OPTION ON FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH NINETEEN NINETY THREE TO PUT THE BONDS BACK TO THE COMPANY AT PAR
c1qc021k THE ISSUE WAS PRICED ONE HUNDRED BASIS POINTS ABOVE THE RATE OF THE TREASURY'S FIVE YEAR NOTE
c1qc021l IN JANUARY SIGNS OF A WEAKENING ECONOMY PROMPTED CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN AND VICE CHAIRMAN JOHNSON TO PUSH THROUGH A SLIGHT EASING OF POLICY ALLOWING INTEREST RATES TO FALL
c1qc021m GOVERNOR ANGELL WORRIED BY THE STRONG COMMODITY PRICES WAS RELUCTANT TO GO ALONG
c1qc021n AND SEVERAL DISTRICT BANK PRESIDENTS LATER BRISTLED BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T CONSULTED
c1qc021o STILL TRADERS WERE ENCOURAGED BY INVESTOR REACTION TO THIS WEEK'S TREASURY FINANCING ESPECIALLY YESTERDAY'S THIRTY YEAR BOND SALE
c1qc021p WE THOUGHT THERE WAS VERY BROAD JAPANESE PARTICIPATION IN THE BOND AUCTION SAID MR. LAKEFIELD OF SHEARSON LEHMAN
c1qc021q BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS WHETHER THE JAPANESE BOUGHT FOR SHORT TERM TRADING ACCOUNTS OR FOR LONG TERM INVESTMENT
c1qc021r ONE CAN UNDERSTAND WHY MR. ICAHN WANTS SO BADLY NOT TO LOSE
c1qc021s HIS FOURTEEN POINT EIGHT PERCENT STOCK INTEREST IN TEXACO IS SHOWING A PAPER PROFIT OF HALF A BILLION DOLLARS RIGHT NOW
c1qc021t HE WANTS TO PRESERVE IT
c1qc021u BUT TEXACO HOLDERS WILL GET A CHANCE TO VOTE ON HIS SIXTY DOLLAR A SHARE OFFER ONLY IF HE WINS A GROUP OF BOARD SEATS
c1qc021v THIS LACK OF UNDERSTANDING HAS INVESTORS LICKING THEIR CHOPS ON TWO FRONTS
c1qc021w ONE CAMP THINKS THAT THE STOCK HAS REMAINED UNDERVALUED AS INVESTORS GRAPPLE TO COMPREHEND THE BUSINESSES
c1qc021x ANOTHER CAMP HOPES FOR A TAKEOVER OR LEVERAGED BUY OUT THOUGH THE ERIE PENNSYLVANIA COMPANY SAYS IT DOESN'T KNOW OF ANY SUCH THING IN THE WORKS
c1qc021y FOR A. B. C. NOW NUMBER TWO A HIT WITH ROSEANNE COULD MEAN A TURNING POINT
c1qc021z PRODUCER MARCY CARSEY SAYS SHE HAS THE SAME FEELING IN HER GUT AS SHE HAD BEFORE THE DEBUT OF COSBY
c1qc0220 BUT THERE THE SIMILARITY ENDS
c1qc0221 THE COSBY SHOW'S CLARE HUXTABLE IS A LOVING LAWYER AND MATRIARCH IN A TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR SWEATER
c1qc0222 ROSEANNE IS AN ACID TONGUED ASSEMBLY LINE WORKER IN AN OLD SWEATSHIRT
c1qc0223 TRADERS SAID INVESTORS APPARENTLY WERE SKITTISH ABOUT BUYING THE KROGER PREFERRED AFTER THE COMPANY'S ANNOUNCEMENT TO RESTRUCTURE
c1qc0224 TRADERS SAID THE COMPANY WILL NOW PAY ITS DUTCH AUCTION PREFERRED HOLDERS EIGHT POINT NINE ONE PERCENT OVER THE NEXT FORTY NINE DAYS UNTIL THE NEXT REGULARLY SCHEDULED AUCTION
c1qc0225 THAT RATE IS MORE THAN TWO PERCENTAGE POINTS OVER PREFERRED DIVIDENDS BY SIMILAR SINGLE A. RATED COMPANIES
c1qc0226 MANY TRADERS ASSUME THE FINANCING WILL CONSIST OF THREE YEAR NOTES TEN YEAR NOTES AND THIRTY YEAR BONDS
c1qc0227 BUT SOME TRADERS SAY THEY AREN'T SO SURE THERE WILL BE ANY THIRTY YEAR BONDS
c1qc0228 THE REASON PRESIDENT REAGAN HASN'T YET SIGNED A TAX BILL WITH A PROVISION THAT WOULD INCREASE THE GOVERMENT'S LONG TERM BOND ISSUANCE AUTHORITY
c1qc0229 PILLSBURY'S VERSION WAS TINGED WITH COOLNESS
c1qc022a IT SAID THAT MR. SHEPPARD MERELY REITERATED HIS DESIRE TO MEET AND THAT MR. SMITH SAW NO PURPOSE IN MEETING
c1qc022b NEVERTHELESS MR. SMITH AGREED TO REPORT THE CONVERSATION TO HIS DIRECTORS
c1qc022c WE REALLY TRY TO DOWNPLAY OUR FORECASTING THE FORTY FOUR YEAR OLD ADVISER SAYS
c1qc022d YOU MAKE A BAD FORECAST AND YOUR BUSINESS IS DOWN THE TUBES
c1qc022e SO MR. DAVIS SELLS REAMS OF CHARTS AND GRAPHS ON SEVERAL HUNDRED MARKET INDICATORS TO ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS
c1qc022f IN BETWEEN THE PURCHASERS' REPORT AND THE JOBS DATA THE GOVERNMENT WILL RELEASE A HALF DOZEN OTHER SERIES INCLUDING JUNE'S LEADING ECONOMIC INDICATORS INDEX
c1qc022g THAT INDEX COULD ADD TO RECESSION FEARS IF IT DECLINES AS EXPECTED
c1qc022h A DROP IN THE GOVERNMENT'S CHIEF ECONOMIC FORECASTING TOOL WOULD MARK THE FOURTH DECLINE IN FIVE MONTHS
c1qc022i A RULE OF THUMB AMONG ECONOMISTS HOLDS THAT THREE SUCCESSIVE DECLINES IN THE INDEX SIGNAL RECESSION
c1rc0201 PHIL WALTERS WHOSE BACK YARD WOULD HAVE FACED THE PROPOSED SHELTER SAYS HE WENT TO MEETINGS TO LEARN BOTH SIDES OF THE SHELTER DEBATE
c1rc0202 BUT JUST FOR WANTING TO HEAR THE PROS AND CONS I BECAME A PRO DERELICT REVOLUTIONARY IN THE EYES OF SOME PEOPLE HE RECALLS
c1rc0203 THEY DIDN'T WANT AN OBJECTIVE STUDY
c1rc0204 THEY JUST WANTED TO PREVENT THE ONSLAUGHT OF THE BUMS
c1rc0205 THERE HAS BEEN NO SHORTAGE IN THE PAST FEW YEARS OF MAJOR EVENTS WITH ETHICAL UNDERTONES FOR CORPORATIONS
c1rc0206 CHERNOBYL'S NUCLEAR EXPLOSION AND UNION CARBIDE'S GAS LEAK RAISE QUESTIONS ANEW ABOUT THE ETHICS OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT ENDANGER HUGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE

c1sc021i IT WOULD REQUIRE THE PRESIDENT TO IDENTIFY COUNTRIES THAT DON'T PROTECT COPYRIGHTS AND PATENTS AND TO INITIATE EXPEDITED UNFAIR TRADE INVESTIGATIONS IN THE MOST EGREGIOUS CASES
c1sc021j THE PRESIDENT COULD NOT DECLINE TO MOVE AGAINST CERTAIN COUNTRIES IF DOING SO WOULD BE AGAINST THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC INTEREST THOUGH
c1sc021k CONGRESS WANTS SPEEDY ACTION BECAUSE TIME OFTEN CAN BE CRITICAL IN WINNING PROTECTION FOR CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SUCH AS COMPUTER SOFTWARE WHICH CAN BE COPIED RAPIDLY

c1sc022d BUT WHAT EXACTLY IS ITS THREAT TO LIFE OR HEALTH
c1sc022e THE BULK OF THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE EFFECTS OF OZONE WHEEZING COUGHING AND TIGHTENING IN THE CHEST ARE SHORT TERM AND REVERSIBLE
c1sc022f THESE EFFECTS BEGIN AT OZONE LEVELS TWO OR THREE TIMES THE FEDERAL STANDARD THOUGH A FEW STUDIES DETECTED SLIGHT EFFECTS AT JUST ABOVE THE STANDARD

c1tc021x HOW MUCH WILL THE GOVERNMENT CONTROL THE ECONOMY
c1tc021y I DON'T THINK IT WILL HAPPEN RIGHT AWAY SAID MR. LAMB
c1tc021z I ALSO DON'T THINK CONGRESS WILL TOTALLY ABOLISH TAX EXEMPTION
c1tc0220 BUT THERE WILL BE MORE LIMITS MORE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED ON TAX EXEMPTS
c1tc0221 I'M ALWAYS MAKING UP STORIES FOR THE KIDS AND ONE OF THEM WAS ABOUT A LITTLE DINOSAUR
c1tc0222 PRETTY SOON THAT WAS THE ONLY STORY THEY WANTED TO HEAR HE SAYS
c1tc0223 MY WIFE JODI GOT THE IDEA OF GIVING THE CHARACTER A NAME AND PUTTING HIM IN A BOOK
c1tc0224 WE PICKED THE NAME DARBY FROM DEAN DARBY SOMEONE WE KNEW IN COLLEGE
c1tc0225 HE'S A BIG POT BELLIED SKINNY LEGGED GUY AND IT KINDA FIT
c1tc0226 I'D NEVER OWNED A SHARE NEVER EVEN KNEW WHAT A DIVIDEND OR THE STOCK EXCHANGE IS HE SAID
c1tc0227 NOW I FOLLOW PRICES EVERY DAY IN THE PAPER
c1tc0228 WHEN I COMPARE WHAT I HAVE TO WHAT I HAD IN NINETEEN SEVENTY I HAVE NO DOUBT I WILL VOTE YES HE SAYS
c1tc0229 AS A RESULT THE SEQUOIA WON'T BE GOING BACK TO THE U. S. NAVY THIS YEAR
c1tc022a OR PERHAPS ANY YEAR
c1tc022b AND THE SHIP WHICH WAS USED BY EIGHT U. S. PRESIDENTS MIGHT EVEN GO UNDER
c1tc022c THE OTHER NON WINNERS MOST NOTABLY EXXON WERE IN MANY WAYS AS NOTEWORTHY AS THE WINNERS
c1tc022d IT IS BELIEVED THAT EXXON WAS OUTBID FOR SEVERAL RESERVE PACKAGES LEAVING IT WITH A LOT OF CASH THAT COULD STILL BE EARMARKED FOR ACQUISITIONS
c1tc022e AT THE HOUSTON PETROLEUM CLUB INDUSTRY OFFICIALS COULDN'T EAT LUNCH OF LATE WITHOUT DISCUSSING SPECULATION THAT EXXON WAS GOING TO WALK AWAY WITH ALL OF THE TENNECO PROPERTIES
c1tc022f AN EXXON SPOKESWOMAN SAID IT WAS COMPANY POLICY NOT TO COMMENT ON ANYTHING TO DO WITH ACQUISITIONS
c1tc022g TO BEGIN WITH COMPANIES HAVE BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB OF MANAGING INVENTORIES
c1tc022h IN THE PAST BUSINESSES HAVE TENDED TO BECOME INCREASINGLY OPTIMISTIC AS EXPANSIONS PERSISTED
c1tc022i WHEN SALES EVENTUALLY SLOWED INVENTORIES QUICKLY REACHED EXCESSIVE LEVELS
c1tc022j COMPANIES THEREUPON CUT THEIR BUYING INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION DECLINED AND A RECESSION WAS UNDER WAY
c1uc0201 TO CURB DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION AND SALVAGE THE TRADE SURPLUS BRAZIL'S ECONOMIC PLANNERS RECENTLY IMPOSED A TOUGH PACKAGE OF TAX AND PRICE INCREASES
c1uc0202 THE RESULT BRAZILIANS LAST WEEK RIOTED IN THE STREETS OF BRASILIA IN THE WORST VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL IN ITS TWENTY SIX YEAR HISTORY
c1uc0203 AND A GENERAL STRIKE HAS BEEN TENTATIVELY SET FOR DECEMBER TWELFTH
c1uc0204 MR. STEWARD WHO HAS MAINTAINED A MR. CLEAN REPUTATION IN THE TOUGH AND SOMETIMES SHADY WORLD OF BOXING IS HIMSELF A MULTIMILLIONAIRE
c1uc0205 HE ARRANGES MATCHES FOR THE BOXERS HE DEVELOPS AND THUS GETS A CUT OF THE PURSE
c1uc0206 IF THE BOXERS ARE CHAMPIONS THE PURSES ARE BIG
c1uc0207 HE DRIVES A GOLD LINCOLN TOWN CAR AND A CARDINAL RED ROLLS ROYCE CORNICHE
c1uc0208 MR. STEWARD RESIDES IN AN AFFLUENT SECTION OF WEST DETROIT WHERE HE OWNS SEVEN HOMES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD USING SOME OF THEM TO HOUSE THE FURNITURE HE COLLECTS
c1uc0209 THE NEXT STEP REQUIRING BUILDING OWNERS TO RETROFIT OLD BUILDINGS WITH SPRINKLERS IS FAR MORE CONTROVERSIAL
c1uc020a ONLY TEN PERCENT TO FIFTEEN PERCENT OF NONRESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS IN THE U. S. HAVE SPRINKLER SYSTEMS ESTIMATES THE NATIONAL FIRE SPRINKLER ASSOCIATION A TRADE GROUP
c1uc020b RETROFITTING BUILDINGS WITH SPRINKLERS USUALLY COSTS TWO DOLLARS TO THREE DOLLARS A SQUARE FOOT TOO MUCH TO MAKE THEM PRACTICAL BUILDING OWNERS ARGUE
c1uc020c HAD THAT HAPPENED THE FAILED BANKS WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER TO THE F. D. I. C. FOR DISPOSITION
c1uc020d IN MOST CASES THE AGENCY SELLS THE FAILED BANK TO ANOTHER INSTITUTION ALONG WITH THE GOOD LOANS
c1uc020e THE F. D. I. C. PURCHASES THE BAD LOANS AND TRIES TO SALVAGE WHATEVER IT CAN
c1uc020f IN A RELATED MATTER OAKWOOD ESTIMATED THAT IT HAD A NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX OPERATING LOSS OF FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IT DIDN'T ESTIMATE REVENUE
c1uc020g THE COMPANY ADDED THAT IT MAY WRITE DOWN SOME ASSETS BECAUSE OF REDUCED COMMODITY PRICES AND NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDELINES
c1uc020h FINAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR HAVEN'T BEEN POSTED
c1uc020i MR. BAKER DECLINED TO GIVE SPECIFICS OF THE COMPROMISE BEYOND SAYING THAT IT MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THEIR PROBLEM AND MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF OUR PROBLEM
c1uc020j HE ADDED HOWEVER THAT HE HAS FOR NOW WITHDRAWN THE PROPOSED COMPROMISE OFFER
c1uc020k WE'RE BACK TO SQUARE ONE HE SAID
c1uc020l THE MAJOR LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES DIDN'T REJECT THE COMPROMISE BUT THEY WEREN'T READY TO ACCEPT IT A U. S. ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL EXPLAINED
c1uc020m THE SALE ALSO PROVIDES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH CASH AS IT TRIES TO NARROW THE BUDGET DEFICIT
c1uc020n AFTER SUBTRACTING UNDERWRITERS' FEES OF ABOUT SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS THE GOVERNMENT'S NET PROCEEDINGS FROM THE OFFERING ARE ONE POINT FIVE EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS
c1uc020o IN ADDITION THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM CONRAIL'S CASH RESERVES UNDER PROVISIONS OF THE PUBLIC OFFERING
c1uc020p AN ENGINEERED SYSTEMS SPOKESMAN SAID THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY AND INTENT TO PAY THE DEBT IN INSTALLMENTS OVER AN EIGHTEEN MONTH PERIOD
c1uc020q HE WOULDN'T SAY WHETHER THE COMPANY WOULD PAY IMMEDIATELY
c1uc020r HE SAID NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE BANK A UNIT OF WELLS FARGO AND COMPANY ARE CONTINUING
c1uc020s CONVENTIONAL WISDOM ECONOMISTS SCOFF AT THIS AND COUNSEL THE WORLD'S LEADERS TO KEEP SWINGING AWAY AT THE TRADE BALANCE
c1uc020t THE MARKET'S ATTACK ON THE DOLLAR SUGGESTS THAT THIS IS A FAILED AND DANGEROUS POLICY
c1uc020u IT IS TIME TO START TALKING ABOUT THE ALTERNATIVE
c1uc020v DESPITE THE DECLINE IN STOCK PRICES TRADING VOLUME WASN'T OVERWHELMING
c1uc020w MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED NINETY THREE POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE COMPARED WITH ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION MONDAY
c1uc020x BUT TRADERS ASSERTED THAT MUCH OF THE LATE ACTIVITY CAME FROM PROFESSIONALS
c1uc020y FINALLY WASHINGTON MUST ABANDON DEBILITATING OR COUNTERPRODUCTIVE MEASURES
c1uc020z IT SHOULD ESPECIALLY AVOID FUNDING BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL AID PROGRAMS THAT MERELY ENCOURAGE THIRD WORLD NATIONS TO EMBRACE THE FAILED PRINCIPLES OF CENTRALIZED PLANNING
c1uc0210 NOR NEED THE U. S. BECOME THE ARBITER OF THIRD WORLD DEBT PROBLEMS AND FASHION A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION
c1uc0211 DEBTOR NATIONS AND PRIVATE WESTERN CREDITORS CAN MORE EFFECTIVELY RESOLVE SHORT TERM DIFFICULTIES ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS
c1uc0212 LONG TERM SOLUTIONS AWAIT THE ADOPTION OF MARKET REFORMS IN THE DEBTOR COUNTRIES REFORMS THAT CURRENT U. S. TRADE AND FOREIGN AID POLICIES TRAGICALLY DELAY
c1uc0213 THROUGHOUT THE THIRTIES PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S ADVISERS WORRIED ABOUT THE LACK OF BUSINESS CONFIDENCE
c1uc0214 THIS INTANGIBLE HAD A PRACTICAL ASPECT THAT CAN BE DIRECTLY TRACED TO THE TAX INCREASES
c1uc0215 ALTHOUGH BY NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN TOTAL REAL OUTPUT HAD RETURNED TO THE LEVEL OF NINETEEN TWENTY NINE MR. STEIN OBSERVES PRIVATE INVESTMENT REMAINED ONE THIRD LOWER
c1uc0216 EVEN THIS RECOVERY WAS LOST IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT WHEN G. N. P. FELL SIX POINT FOUR PERCENT
c1uc0217 THE TOP INCOME TAX RATE HAD RISEN TO SIXTY EIGHT PERCENT INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX COLLECTIONS IN FISCAL NINETEEN THIRTY NINE FELL TWENTY PERCENT
c1uc0218 PRATT AND WHITNEY SAID LAST WEEK IT MIGHT LAY OFF EMPLOYEES AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR BECAUSE OF DECREASED DEMAND FOR JET ENGINES AND PARTS
c1uc0219 THE COMPANY DECLINED TO DISCUSS HOW MANY EMPLOYEES MIGHT BE LAID OFF OR IF THE LOSS WOULD BE PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY
c1uc021a BUT UNION OFFICIALS SAID THE COMPANY HAS TOSSED AROUND NUMBERS FROM ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND
c1uc021b SOME CRITICS SEE THE GROWTH CONTROL MOVEMENT AS THE INDULGENCE OF A SELF SATISFIED MIDDLE CLASS
c1uc021c AND SOME CHARGE THAT THERE ARE RACIST ROOTS
c1uc021d THE FACT IS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE SEEING HISPANICS AND ASIANS AROUND SAYS DANIEL GARCIA THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOS ANGELES PLANNING COMMISSION
c1uc021e THE COMPANY SAYS IT INTENDS TO PURCHASE THOSE SHARES TENDERED AT OR BELOW TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS A SHARE
c1uc021f SHARES TENDERED AT HIGHER PRICES WILL BE RETURNED TO HOLDERS TORCHMARK SAID
c1uc021g IN NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING FRIDAY TORCHMARK CLOSED AT TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS UP ONE DOLLAR AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS
c1uc021h FORD'S FOURTH QUARTER SALES WERE EIGHTEEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS UP FIFTEEN PERCENT FROM SIXTEEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR EARLIER
c1uc021i FULL YEAR SALES ROSE FOURTEEN PERCENT TO SEVENTY ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS FROM SIXTY TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS
c1uc021j THAT LARGE JUMP ENABLED FORD TO INCREASE ITS SHARE OF THE U. S. NEW CAR MARKET TO TWENTY POINT TWO PERCENT FROM EIGHTEEN POINT TWO PERCENT
c1uc021k DAVID DENTON AN ASSOCIATE U. S. ATTORNEY IN MANHATTAN DEFENDS THE GOVERNMENT'S TACTICS
c1uc021l SEARCH WARRANTS ARE USED WHEN THEY APPEAR APPROPRIATE IN A PARTICULAR CASE MR. DENTON SAYS NOTING THAT A FEDERAL MAGISTRATE OR JUDGE MAKES THE DETERMINATION
c1uc021m IN OAKLEY SUTTON'S CASE THE GOVERNMENT SUBMITTED A SEALED AFFIDAVIT TO SUPPORT ITS REQUEST FOR THE WARRANT
c1uc021n ACCORDING TO PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE INVESTIGATION THE AFFIDAVIT CONTAINS INFORMATION PROVIDED BY A DISGRUNTLED FORMER OAKLEY SUTTON EMPLOYEE WHO WAS FIRED PRIOR TO THE RAID
c1uc021o MR. DENTON NOTES THAT FEDERAL AGENTS ARE ROUTINELY ARMED AND THAT THE LARGE NUMBER OF AGENTS USED MAY SIMPLY REFLECT THE VOLUME OF DOCUMENTS BEING SEIZED
c1uc021p IN ADDITION LAURENTIAN SAID BERNHARD M. KOCH THIRTY THREE WAS NAMED VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
c1uc021q HE SUCCEEDS JOHN STROM WHO TRANSFERRED TO A LAURENTIAN CAPITAL UNIT
c1uc021r PREVIOUSLY MR. KOCH WAS DIRECTOR OF INTERNAL AUDIT AT LAURENTIAN GROUP CORPORATION AND IMPERIAL LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY OF CANADA MAJORITY SHAREHOLDERS OF LAURENTIAN CAPITAL
c1uc021s JUST BEFORE THE OCTOBER NINETEENTH GLOBAL EQUITIES CRASH HONGKONG BANK ECONOMISTS EXPRESSED SIMILAR CONCERN ABOUT THE SPECULATION THAT THEN DOMINATED THE LOCAL STOCK MARKET
c1uc021t THEIR PROPERTY REPORT RECALLS THE EQUITIES CRASH AS A REMINDER THAT ASSET VALUES CANNOT DEFY GRAVITY FOR EVER
c1uc021u THIS WARNING NOW REPRESENTS A MINORITY VIEW
c1uc021v BUT CRITICS CHARGED THAT THE COLLAR ACTUALLY ADDED TO VOLATILITY BY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR INDEX ARBITRAGERS TO DO THEIR BUSINESS
c1uc021w MANY TRADERS ARGUE THAT SUCH ARBITRAGE HAS THE EFFECT OF SMOOTHING OUT VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS
c1uc021x INDEX ARBITRAGERS BUY AND SELL LARGE AMOUNTS OF STOCKS AND STOCK INDEX FUTURES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BRIEF PRICE DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO RELATED INSTRUMENTS
c1uc021y SECRETARIES ARE ALSO EASY TARGETS FOR A HUG ESPECIALLY IN HOLLYWOOD
c1uc021z I'VE SEEN A WRITER WALK INTO AN OFFICE AND PULL A SECRETARY UP AGAINST HIM
c1uc0220 SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SAYS CHARLES FRIES CHAIRMAN OF FRIES ENTERTAINMENT INCORPORATED
c1uc0221 THIS WAS A TEMPORARY SETBACK FOR BANK OF NEW YORK
c1uc0222 BUT LAST AUGUST THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TOLD BANCA COMMERCIALE THAT IT MUST FILE AN APPLICATION WITH THE FED AS PART OF THE ITALIAN BANK'S BID
c1uc0223 BANCA COMMERCIALE CALLED THE FED'S REQUIREMENTS UNACCEPTABLE AND DROPPED ITS BID
c1uc0224 MOST ECONOMISTS IN THE U. S. SEE THE U. S. TRADE DEFICIT ALSO SHRINKING
c1uc0225 THAT SHOULD HELP JAPAN
c1uc0226 BUT JAPANESE FEAR THAT EMOTIONS AIRED IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WILL BE BAD NEWS FOR THEM WHOEVER WINS
c1uc0227 LISTENING TO DEMOCRAT MICHAEL DUKAKIS IS JUST LIKE SEEING THE GHOST OF U. S.
c1uc0229 BUT THE PAPER ADDS THE LIKELIHOOD OF A BUSH VICTORY DOESN'T MEAN WE WILL BE SAFE
c1uc022a INDEED THE NEW U. S. TRADE BILL GIVES THE WHITE HOUSE LESS ROOM TO SIDESTEP PUNISHING JAPAN FOR TRADE VIOLATIONS
c1uc022b UNDER PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS CORPORATE BAILOUTS AND RESTRUCTURINGS WERE COMMON
c1uc022c BUT SOME LED TO CHARGES OF CORRUPTION THAT ARE NOW BEING INVESTIGATED IN THE OPPOSITION CONTROLLED NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
c1uc022d PRESIDENT ROH TAE WOO'S GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WANT TO PROVOKE SIMILAR SUSPICIONS NOR DOES IT WANT TO APPEAR TO BE SHORING UP ANOTHER FAILING COMPANY AT TAXPAYERS' EXPENSE
c1uc022e THE DOLLAR WAS CONFINED TO FAIRLY NARROW RANGES IN ASIAN AND EARLY EUROPEAN TRADING AS MARKET PARTICIPANTS CONCENTRATED ON MARK YEN TRADING
c1uc022f THE GERMAN CURRENCY TRADED IN A RANGE BETWEEN SEVENTY THREE POINT THREE OH YEN AND SEVENTY THREE POINT SIX FIVE YEN THROUGH MOST OF NEW YORK TRADING
c1uc022g AT THE NEW YORK FINISH THE MARK WAS UNCHANGED AT SEVENTY THREE POINT FOUR SIX YEN
c1uc022h HIGHER COMMISSIONS CAN ALSO REDUCE THE INVESTMENT VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES THAT INCLUDE A SAVINGS COMPONENT SUCH AS UNIVERSAL LIFE POLICIES
c1uc022i IN GENERAL POLICIES WITH HIGHER COMMISSIONS HAVE LOWER SURRENDER VALUES
c1uc022j THAT'S WHAT POLICYHOLDERS GET IF THEY CASH IN THE POLICY OR WHAT THEY CAN BORROW THROUGH POLICY LOANS
c1vc0201 THE ENERGY CONCERN SAID ITS BOARD MET THURSDAY AND WILL MEET AGAIN SHORTLY
c1vc0202 IT SAID IT EXPECTS TO MAKE A FURTHER ANNOUNCEMENT ON THIS SUBJECT EARLY THIS WEEK
c1vc0203 IT WOULDN'T ELABORATE

c1vc020h U. S. STORAGE BINS HOLD ROUGHLY AN EIGHT MONTH SUPPLY OF CORN AND A TEN MONTH SUPPLY OF WHEAT WHEN A THREE MONTH SUPPLY WOULD DO

c1vc020k THE PHILIP MORRIS MAGAZINE ENJOYS BY FAR THE HIGHEST CIRCULATION OF ANY COMPANY MAGAZINE SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION COPIES
c1vc020l THE ONLY REQUIREMENT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE AN ADULT TO RECEIVE THE MAGAZINE SAYS MARY TAYLOR ASSOCIATE PUBLISHER
c1vc020m THAT'S NOT BECAUSE OF RACY ARTICLES BUT BECAUSE THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF TRYING TO SNATCH TWELVE AND THIRTEEN YEAR OLDS
c1vc020n PHILIP MORRIS IS EVEN CONSIDERING SELLING SPACE TO OUTSIDE ADVERTISERS IT ALREADY RAN AN AD FOR TIME MAGAZINE ON A TEST BASIS IN ITS WINTER NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN ISSUE
c1vc020o MARKET PROFESSIONALS SAY INVESTORS WILL FIND IT EASIER TO SORT OUT MUTUAL FUND PROSPECTUSES IF THEY FAMILIARIZE THEMSELVES WITH SOME BASIC SECTIONS AND TERMS
c1vc020p THEY SAY IT SHOULDN'T TAKE MORE THAN TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES TO PLUCK THE VITAL INFORMATION FROM THESE DOCUMENTS
c1vc020q THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS CAN PROVIDE A STARTING POINT AND PERHAPS HELP AN INVESTOR GET THROUGH PROSPECTUSES MORE EASILY
c1vc020r ALSO BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE CASH GUZZLERS CONSTANTLY NEEDING MONEY FOR CLINICAL TRIALS AND MANUFACTURING FACILITIES
c1vc020s THE CRITICAL FACTOR FOR MOST COMPANIES ISN'T HOW MUCH CASH THEY HAVE BUT HOW IT'S BEING SPENT MR. MACCALLUM SAYS
c1vc020t SOME COMPANIES THAT ARE SELLING AT CLOSE TO THEIR PER SHARE CASH VALUES ARE CORRECTLY BEING PERCEIVED IN A SKEPTICAL LIGHT HE CONTENDS
c1vc020u LATELY CHRISTMAS SHOPPERS OR AT LEAST INVESTORS APPEAR TO PREFER BOOKS AND CRAFTS
c1vc020v CRAFT HOUSE ROSE ONE AND THREE EIGHTHS YESTERDAY TO FOURTEEN
c1vc020w THE ISSUE STARTED THE YEAR AT FIVE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS AND WAS STILL AT ELEVEN AFTER LAST MONTH'S CRASH

c1vc020y GEORGE BANTA ROSE ONE QUARTER TO FIFTEEN
c1vc020z KEMP'S CAMPAIGN TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE TONE
c1vc0210 IN ONE SURE SIGN OF A CANDIDACY IN TROUBLE HE LASHES OUT AT CRITICISM FROM A LIGHTLY REGARDED T. V. COMMENTATOR
c1vc0211 EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
c1vc0212 BUT HIS LONGTIME HOSTILITIES WITH DOLE LEAVE A SPOT ON A BUSH TICKET AS ABOUT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY
c1vc0213 WE'VE HAD A MAJOR RUN UP LAST WEEK PARTICULARLY FRIDAY NOTED MR. POLCE
c1vc0214 BUT HE ADDED THAT THE DOLLAR CAME UP TOO FAST THE MARKET'S BEEN CONSOLIDATING ITS GAINS
c1vc0215 MOREOVER MR. POLCE SAID THAT NOBODY REALLY WANTS TO BE TOO AGGRESSIVE TILL THE JAPANESE TRADE NUMBERS COME OUT
c1vc0216 STILL COMPANY INSIDERS SAID THE RESTRUCTURING WAS ENTIRELY MR. AKERS'S PLAN AND WASN'T FORCED ON HIM BY THE I. B. M. BOARD

c1vc021e THE LATEST WEATHER FORECAST CALLS FOR FAIRLY GOOD MOISTURE IN MIDWEST FARMING STATES OVER THE NEXT SIX TO TEN DAYS
c1vc021f ANALYSTS SAID TRADERS ARE SHIFTING THEIR EMPHASIS AWAY FROM LAST YEAR'S CROP AND TO THIS YEAR'S
c1vc021g WITH THIS YEAR'S SMALL ACREAGE INCREASES WEATHER AND SPRING PLANTING CONDITIONS ARE MAJOR CONCERNS TO A MARKET THAT IS BEGINNING TO SHAKE OFF A HUGE SURPLUS

c1vc021v NOBODY KNOWS WHO WILL BE THE NEXT TO GO
c1vc021w OVERALL CONSUMER SPENDING HAS SLOWED SINCE LAST YEAR'S STOCK MARKET CRASH BUT IT'S STILL AT A LEVEL THAT WORRIES SOME ECONOMISTS
c1vc021x CONSUMER CREDIT SLOWED SHARPLY IN JULY REFLECTING SLUGGISH SALES
c1vc021y TOO MUCH SPENDING AT HOME COUPLED WITH HEAVY DEMAND FOR EXPORTS COULD OVERLOAD AN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THAT IS ALREADY RUNNING NEAR CAPACITY
c1vc021z PETER DAPUZZO HEAD OF RETAIL TRADING AT SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON ALSO LOOKS FOR A SHARP UPWARD MOVE IN STOCK PRICES GIVEN A FEW IFS
c1vc0220 ONE IS IF ITS INVESTORS DON'T GET SPOOKED AT THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE CRASH
c1vc0221 ANOTHER IS IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE EASES INTEREST RATES

c1vc0227 THE SUIT CHARGES THAT BURGER KING ONLY ALLOWS BLACK FRANCHISEES TO EXPAND ONE STORE AT A TIME WHILE WHITES ARE ALLOWED TO SIMULTANEOUSLY OPEN MULTIPLE FRANCHISES
c1vc0228 BURGER KING ALSO MAKES BLACKS WAIT THREE TO FOUR TIMES LONGER THAN WHITES FOR APPROVAL OF A NEW OR EXPANSION FRANCHISE THE SUIT SAYS
c1vc0229 THE FRANCHISEES FURTHER ALLEGE THAT BURGER KING FALSELY AND FRAUDULENTLY MISREPRESENTED THE SALES POTENTIAL OF THEIR STORES

c1zc021d ALL SEVEN REGIONAL BELLS HAVE VOWED TO APPEAL THE DECEMBER THIRD RULING BY JUDGE HAROLD GREENE THAT FORBIDS THEM TO DESIGN FABRICATE OR ASSEMBLE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT
c1zc021e OF COURSE IF THE APPEAL FAILS MANY VENTURES COULD BE JEOPARDIZED OR SCRATCHED
c1zc021f BUT IF IT SUCCEEDS COMPANIES THAT HAVEN'T DISMANTLED OR SCALED BACK THEIR RESEARCH EFFORTS COULD SUDDENLY BE AHEAD OF THE COMPETITION
c1zc021g SOME REPORTERS WERE MORE ORIGINAL
c1zc021h A PAIR FROM A LOCAL PAPER ASKED EDSEL IF HE FAVORED CASINO GAMBLING IN DETROIT A CONCEPT HEAVILY PROMOTED BY MAYOR COLEMAN YOUNG
c1zc021i THE STRANGEST INQUIRY LOBBED AT BILL WAS WHAT ROLE I SAW AT FORD FOR MY DAUGHTERS WHO ARE TWO YEARS OLD AND TWO MONTHS OLD

c1zc021n BUT WITH THE IMPORTED DOGS CAME PROBLEMS
c1zc021o ONE WAS COST
c1zc021p WHENEVER THEY STRAY FROM THE COUNTRY'S COOL CAPITAL THE NORTHERN BRED DOGS NEED AIR CONDITIONED ACCOMMODATION
c1zc021q SPECIAL VEHICLES HAVE BEEN BUILT TO SQUIRE THEM AROUND
c1zc021r EACH DOG NEEDS A TRAINER
c1zc021s A COOK PREPARES THE DOG CHOW
c1zc021u HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
c1zc021v TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
c1zc021w THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
c1zc021x THE PROPOSALS REQUIRE THE APPROVAL OF HOLDERS OF SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE UNITS FOR A BUSINESS COMBINATION UNLESS CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET
c1zc021y THE VOTE OF UNIT HOLDERS REQUIRED TO REMOVE A GENERAL PARTNER IS RAISED TO SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT FROM A MAJORITY
c1zc021z AND MANAGEMENT IS EMPOWERED TO ISSUE PREFERRED UNITS
c1zc0220 YOU'VE HAD A TREMENDOUS FALLOFF HERE THAT'S ONLY GOING TO GET BIGGER AS WE APPROACH THE SUMMER DOLDRUMS ONE TRADER SAYS
c1zc0221 HE ESTIMATES THAT INSTITUTIONAL VOLUME HAS TUMBLED FROM YEAR EARLIER LEVELS BY FORTY PERCENT SO FAR THIS MONTH AND THIRTY PERCENT FOR THE YEAR TO DATE
c1zc0223 INVESTORS ALSO PREFER REMICS BACKED BY SWAP TEN PERCENT SECURITIES BECAUSE PREPAYMENTS ARE LESS VOLATILE
c1zc0224 FREDDIE MAC PASSES THROUGH ACTUAL PREPAYMENTS ON SWAP MORTGAGE ISSUES WHILE IT ESTIMATES PREPAYMENTS ON THE CASH ISSUES
c1zc0225 PREPAYMENTS ON FREDDIE MAC CASH ISSUES ARE MUCH MORE VOLATILE FROM MONTH TO MONTH THAN PREPAYMENTS ON THE SWAP ISSUES
c1zc0226 MR. TAYLOR WILL REMAIN PRESIDENT A POST HE HAS HELD SINCE MAY FIRST
c1zc0228 PREVIOUSLY HE WAS PRESIDENT OF CIGNA'S PROPERTY CASUALTY GROUP FOR FIVE YEARS AND SERVED AS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
c1zc0229 THE GUIDE LOOKS DOWN AND PULLS AT HIS SOCKS
c1zc022a LATER HE SAYS WHEN THE RUSSIANS LIBERATED SMOLENSK A NEW COMMISSION FOUND GERMAN BULLETS IN THE SKULLS OF THE OFFICERS
c1zc022b AND THE METHOD BY WHICH THEY WHERE SHOT IN THE BACKS OF THE HEADS WAS A GERMAN METHOD
c1zc022c AND THEY FOUND GERMAN WEAPONS
c1zc022d THAT IS WHY THE RUSSIANS SAID IT WAS DONE BY THE NAZIS IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE
c1zc022e AND THAT IS EVERYTHING I KNOW
c1zc022f RYAN'S FAMILY STEAK HOUSES ALSO ROSE REACHING A FIFTY TWO WEEK HIGH OF EIGHT AND FIVE EIGHTHS UP ONE QUARTER
c1zc022g VOLUME OF TWO POINT TWO MILLION SHARES MADE IT THE MOST ACTIVE O. T. C. ISSUE
c1zc022h STANDARD AND POOR'S ADDED THE STOCK TO ITS S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED STOCK INDEX TO REPLACE CULLINET SOFTWARE WHICH WAS ACQUIRED
c1zc022i STOCKS USUALLY RISE WHEN THEY ARE ADDED TO THE INDEX BECAUSE THE SHARES ARE BOUGHT TO BALANCE PORTFOLIOS THAT ARE BASED ON THE INDEX
c20c0201 FRANCE FUND INCORPORATED HAD A NET ASSET VALUE OF FOURTEEN DOLLARS AND FORTY SIX CENTS AND A CLOSING PRICE OF TEN AND ONE EIGHTH AS OF THURSDAY
c20c0202 GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INCORPORATED HAD A NET ASSET VALUE OF NINE DOLLARS AND THIRTY SIX CENTS AND A CLOSING PRICE OF EIGHT AND SEVEN EIGHTHS AS OF FRIDAY

c20c0205 FUJITSU'S BID FOR CONTROL OF FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR HAS LEFT THE PENTAGON DIVIDED
c20c0206 SOME FEAR A TAKEOVER OF THE MILITARY SUBCONTRACTOR COULD HURT NATIONAL SECURITY
c20c0207 BUT OTHERS SAY IT MIGHT ENCOURAGE JAPAN TO TRANSFER MILITARY TECHNOLOGY TO THE U. S.
c20c0208 ANY SUCH AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE AIRLINES AND AIRPORT OPERATORS COULD BE WRITTEN INTO THE CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION REAUTHORIZING THE AVIATION TRUST FUND
c20c0209 THE TRUST FUND WHICH IS FINANCED BY TICKET AND FUEL TAXES HELPS PAY FOR F. A. A. OPERATIONS AND PROVIDES GRANTS TO AIRPORTS
c20c020a SOME HAVE SUGGESTED THAT AIRPORT OPERATORS AS A CONDITION OF ACCEPTING THE GRANTS AGREE TO GIVE UP SOME AUTHORITY IN MAKING NOISE RULES
c20c020b IN HEAVY TRADING FRIDAY PROFIT TAKING CAUSED THE NIKKEI AVERAGE TO SLIP SEVENTY POINT ONE EIGHT TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIVE POINT EIGHT FIVE

c20c020e VOLUME TOTALED ABOUT ONE BILLION SHARES
c20c020f LONE STAR INDUSTRIES INCORPORATED SAID IT ARRANGED A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR FINANCING THROUGH ISSUANCE OF PROMISSORY NOTES TO A GROUP OF TWENTY TWO LENDERS
c20c020g THE EIGHT AND THREE QUARTERS PERCENT NOTES WILL MATURE IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO
c20c020h PROCEEDS WILL BE USED TO REFINANCE AND RETIRE DEBT AND FOR GENERAL PURPOSES
c20c020i LONE STAR BASED IN GREENWICH CONNECTICUT IS A PRODUCER OF CEMENT AND OTHER CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS
c20c020j THE NEW GOVERNMENT HAS STARTED TO LOWER PERSONAL INCOME TAXES AND AT THE SAME TIME IT HAS BEGUN TO BRING ITS OWN SPENDING UNDER CONTROL
c20c020k IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN BUDGET THE HIGHEST RATE OF INCOME TAX WAS LOWERED TO FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT FROM SIXTY FIVE PERCENT
c20c020l THIS IS PART OF A WORLD WIDE MOVEMENT THAT FRANCE MUST FOLLOW TO KEEP ITS MOST ENERGETIC AGGRESSIVE AND BRIGHT YOUNG PEOPLE AND TO ATTRACT INVESTORS
c20c020m MR. BOTHA ALSO MUST RULE ON THE FATE OF THE GROUP AREAS ACT
c20c020n VIOLATIONS OF THE ACT ARE RAMPANT BUT THERE WERE ONLY FOUR PROSECUTIONS UNDER IT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX ONE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND NONE THE YEAR BEFORE
c20c020o A RECENT POLL BY THE AFRIKAANS NEWSPAPER RAPPORT FOUND THAT ONLY TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF SURVEYED WHITES WANT THE ACT RETAINED
c20c020p MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR PERCENT WANT IT SCRAPPED COMPLETELY WHILE ANOTHER THIRTY FOUR PERCENT WANT EACH LOCAL COMMUNITY OR PROPERTY OWNER TO DECIDE WHO CAN RENT OR BUY HOUSING
c20c020q THE LATEST DISCLOSURES ARE AN OUTGROWTH OF THAT PROBE
c20c020r ALREADY THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS ACCUSED DELTA AIRLINES AND EASTERN AIRLINES OF ENGAGING IN UNREALISTIC SCHEDULING AT ATLANTA'S HARTSFIELD AIRPORT
c20c020s THE CARRIERS DENY THIS BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS EXPANDED ITS PROBE
c20c020t IT HAS ASKED SEVERAL OTHER AIRLINES TO TURN OVER THEIR ON TIME RECORDS AT DALLAS FORT WORTH CHICAGO'S O'HARE AND BOSTON'S LOGAN AIRPORTS
c20c020u DESPITE THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFICIAL EXPECTATIONS PRIVATE ECONOMISTS HAD BEEN PREDICTING THAT GROWTH IN THE MOST RECENT FISCAL YEAR WOULD BE BELOW EVEN THE REVISED TARGET
c20c020v YESTERDAY'S G. N. P. FIGURES WERE WITHIN GENERAL EXPECTATIONS SUSUMU TAKETOMI SENIOR ECONOMIST FOR INDUSTRIAL BANK OF JAPAN LIMITED SAID
c20c020w THE BANK HAD PREDICTED GROWTH OF TWO POINT FIVE PERCENT
c20c020x THOSE CREDITORS INCLUDE MULTILATERAL AGENCIES LATIN AMERICAN AND SOME EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS AND SHORT TERM COMMERCIAL BANK CREDITORS AND SUPPLIERS
c20c020y PERU RECENTLY RESUMED DEBT PAYMENTS TO THE INTER AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
c20c020z BUT THERE AREN'T ANY CURRENT PLANS TO RESUME PAYMENTS TO THE WORLD BANK OR THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE ADVISER SAID
c20c0210 ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE IS PROVIDED BY COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS COLLECTIONS OF SMALLER FUNDS DONATED BY MANY INDIVIDUALS
c20c0211 THE ENDOWMENTS ARE POOLED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES BUT GRANTS ARE ISSUED UNDER THE INDIVIDUAL DONORS' NAMES
c20c0212 FUNDS CAN BE STARTED FOR AS LITTLE AS FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND CONTRIBUTIONS ARE DEDUCTIBLE AT THE FIFTY PERCENT LIMIT
c20c0213 UNDER BANKRUPTCY LAW TEXACO ALONE CURRENTLY HAS THE RIGHT TO PROPOSE A REORGANIZATION PLAN FOR ITSELF
c20c0214 THAT RIGHT EXPIRES NEXT MONTH BUT TEXACO HAS ASKED JUDGE SCHWARTZBERG TO BLOCK PROPOSALS FROM ANY OTHER PARTIES UNTIL MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
c20c0215 THE PENNZOIL SPOKESMAN SAID THE REORGANIZATION PLAN TO BE OUTLINED TODAY WOULD BE PRESENTED AS PART OF A MOTION OPPOSING TEXACO'S REQUEST FOR MORE TIME
c20c0216 HE HAS A HUGE SENSE OF HUMOR AND IS BY ALL ACCOUNTS A NICE MAN
c20c0217 CRITICS SAY HE IS CAPTIVATED BY HIS OWN ELOQUENCE
c20c0218 TRUE HE SAYS SOMETIMES I DON'T KNOW WHEN TO SHUT UP
c20c0219 IF ITS MAVERICK STRATEGY WORKS SECURITY PACIFIC WILL BE SHOWING ANOTHER WAY BESIDES ACQUISITIONS FOR SUPERREGIONAL BANKS TO GROW
c20c021a THESE BANKS' MANAGERS INCLUDING MR. FLAMSON PLAN TO EVENTUALLY CHALLENGE THE BIG NEW YORK BANKS AS NATIONAL GIANTS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT
c20c021b BOLSTERED BY STRONG EQUITY CAPITAL POSITIONS SUPERREGIONALS ALREADY ARE GROWING FASTER THAN MONEY CENTER INSTITUTIONS
c20c021c WITH A REBOUND IN THE STOCK MARKET INVESTORS' FEARS ABOUT A RECESSION COOLED AND THE BOND MARKET SLUMPED
c20c021d A SHARP SLIDE IN THE U. S. DOLLAR ALSO ADDED SOME DOWNWARD PRESSURE TO BOND PRICES
c20c021e DESPITE THE DECLINE IN BONDS THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM STILL CONTINUED TO MAKE GOOD ON ITS PROMISE TO PROVIDE AMPLE LIQUIDITY THROUGH ITS OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS
c20c021f ABANDONING A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT COST A UTILITY A BUNDLE
c20c021g BUT STATE REGULATORS APPROVED A RATE INCREASE TO COVER THE COSTS
c20c021h NOW THE I. R. S. RULES THAT THE UTILITY IS ALSO ENTITLED TO A LOSS DEDUCTION FOR THE COSTS OF THE ABANDONED PLANT
c20c021i MR. WASHINGTON GREW UP IN CHICAGO POLITICS
c20c021j AS A TEEN AGER HE DISTRIBUTED LEAFLETS FOR HIS FATHER ROY A PRECINCT WORKER ON THE SOUTH SIDE
c20c021k AFTER SERVING AS AN ARMY SERGEANT ON GUAM DURING WORLD WAR TWO HE EARNED A LAW DEGREE FROM NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
c20c021l HIS MARRIAGE TO HIS HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART ENDED IN DIVORCE IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE
c20c021m BUT HE ADVANCED THROUGH A SERIES OF DEMOCRATIC PATRONAGE JOBS TO ELECTION TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND FINALLY TO CONGRESS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY
c20c021n SENATOR BENTSEN'S CORPORATE TAX PROPOSAL WOULD REPLACE A PROVISION IN THE COMMITTEE BILL ALLOWING THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE TO WITHHOLD REFUNDS FROM TAXPAYERS WHO HAVE DEFAULTED ON GOVERNMENT LOANS
c20c021o THIS PROVISION WOULDN'T RAISE ANY MONEY IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AND SENATOR BENTSEN WANTED SOMETHING THAT WOULD ALLOW A QUICKER END TO THE DIESEL TAX COLLECTION
c20c021p THE TEXAS DEMOCRAT PLANS TO OFFER HIS SUBSTITUTION WHEN THE TAX PACKAGE REACHES THE SENATE FLOOR
c20c021q COTTON FUTURES PRICES FOR COTTON FROM THE CURRENT CROP ROSE ON BUYING MOSTLY BY TRADERS WHO FOLLOW CHART SIGNALS
c20c021r THE ADVANCE IN TURN PULLED UP PRICES OF DELIVERY MONTHS REPRESENTING THE NEW CROP SEASON WHICH WILL BEGIN AUGUST ONE
c20c021s THE JULY DELIVERY ROSE ONE POINT FIVE NINE CENTS A POUND TO SIXTY FOUR POINT FOUR EIGHT CENTS
c20c021t THE OCTOBER CONTRACT WAS UP ZERO POINT FIVE EIGHT CENT TO SIXTY POINT THREE CENTS A POUND
c20c021u ONE ANALYST OBSERVED THAT NEW CROP CONTRACTS WERE UNDER PRESSURE EARLIER IN THE DAY BECAUSE OF THE PERCEPTION THAT MOISTURE IN THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA MIGHT BE HEAVIER THAN NEEDED
c20c021v BUT LATER IN THE SESSION TRADERS CHANGED THEIR MINDS HE SAID DECIDING THAT RAIN MIGHT NOT BE ADEQUATE
c20c021w ANALYSTS SAID THE PROXY FIGHT DEFEAT DEALS A BODY BLOW TO BANK OF NEW YORK'S BID
c20c021x JAMES J. MCDERMOTT JUNIOR DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH FOR KEEFE BRUYETTE AND WOODS INCORPORATED SAID THIS EFFECTIVELY PUTS THE DEAL OUT TO PASTURE
c20c021y JAMES WOODEN OF SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON INCORPORATED SAID THERE'S NO QUICK FIX FOR THIS
c20c021z GIVEN THE NATURE OF OUR OWNERSHIP IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE MR. ELISH SAID
c20c0220 THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO CONSIDER AND WE'RE LOOKING AT IT
c20c0221 BUT NOTHING IS IMMINENT
c20c0222 ONE MILLION FAMILIES FALL INTO POVERTY EACH YEAR BECAUSE OF THE DEVASTATING COSTS OF LONG TERM ILLNESS
c20c0223 THE PRIVATE SECTOR CANNOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM
c20c0224 WE NEED A SOCIAL INSURANCE PROGRAM THAT WILL PROTECT PEOPLE OF ALL AGES AGAINST THE FINANCIAL BURDENS OF LONG TERM ILLNESS
c20c0225 MR. DEMME THINKS A MAN WHO PLAYS SPOONS ON THE STREET IS FUNNY
c20c0226 HE CASTS JOSEPH L. MR.
c20c0227 SPOONS JONES TO PLAY HIMSELF A MAN WHO PLAYS SPOONS ON THE STREET
c20c0228 MR. SPOONS TELLS ANGELA WHERE SHE CAN LOOK FOR A JOB AFTER SHE'S LEFT THE SUBURBS FOR MANHATTAN'S LOWER EAST SIDE HER LITTLE BOY IN TOW
c20c0229 IN THE POSITION I'M IN I COULD RAISE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY IN TEN DAYS MORE THAN I WOULD NEED HE SAYS
c20c022a BUT I WON'T DO IT
c20c022b I WOULD BE DEFEATED BEFORE I WOULD ACCEPT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS
c20c022c BUT FREEDOM ISN'T AN ACCIDENT
c20c022d IT IS THE RESULT OF PAINSTAKING WORK TO MAINTAIN THE STRUCTURE OF LIBERTY AGAINST INEVITABLE EROSION AT THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNMENT
c20c022e I THOUGHT THAT MY WORK FOR THE A. C. L. U. WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF MAINTAINING FREEDOM FOR EVERYONE
c20c022f I NOW CONFESS MY ERROR AND EMBRACE LEADER BUSH'S PERCEPTION THAT THE A. C. L. U. IS A POLITICALLY SUSPECT LIBERAL CONSPIRACY
c20c022g UNTIL GILBERT BLEW NINE WEEKS AGO JAMAICA WAS ENJOYING A SECOND YEAR OF STRONG ECONOMIC RECOVERY
c20c022h BUT MR. SEAGA A DOUR TECHNOCRAT HADN'T TRANSFORMED THE BRIGHT ECONOMIC PICTURE INTO POLITICAL CAPITAL
c20c022i JAMAICANS COMPLAINED HE HAD STRIPPED SOCIAL SERVICES AND CUT EDUCATION
c21c0202 IT IS JUST THAT IT IS SOMETHING NEW THAT MAY BE VERY DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT
c21c0203 IN THE END THE SAFETY NET IS THE OLD AND TRIED PRODUCTION CEILINGS WHICH CAN TIGHTEN SUPPLIES AND BOOST PRICES MR. LICHTBLAU SAYS
c21c0204 A MISCALCULATION PROMPTED CALIFORNIA TO MOVE FIRST
c21c0205 LEGISLATORS WORRIED THAT PROPOSITION THIRTEEN TAX RESTRAINTS WOULD FORCE BIG LAYOFFS OF GOVERNMENT WORKERS HURRIEDLY PASSED A SHORT TIME COMPENSATION LAW IN JULY NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT
c21c0206 THOSE LAYOFFS NEVER CAME BUDGET SURPLUSES PERMITTED STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO RETAIN STAFFS
c21c0207 BUT SOME PRIVATE EMPLOYERS SAW IN THE LAW AN ANSWER TO THEIR OWN NEEDS
c21c0208 <NOISE> JEWISH ACTIVIST IOSIF BEGUN SAID HE PLANNED TO IMMIGRATE TO ISRAEL
c21c0209 BEGUN WAS FREED FRIDAY FROM A SOVIET PRISON WHERE HE HAD BEEN JAILED MORE THAN THREE YEARS AGO FOR ANTI STATE ACTIVITIES
c21c020a SEPARATELY ISRAELI OFFICIALS URGED THE U. S. TO DENY FREE ENTRY TO JEWS WHO LEAVE THE SOVIET UNION SAYING THEY SHOULD SETTLE IN ISRAEL
c21c020b IN HIS NEW JOB MR. DARMAN WILL REPORT TO SHERMAN R. LEWIS JUNIOR AND PETER J. SOLOMON CO CHAIRMAN OF SHEARSON LEHMAN'S INVESTMENT BANKING DIVISION
c21c020c HE WILL CONTINUE TO LIVE IN WASHINGTON
c21c020d SHEARSON LEHMAN IS A SUBSIDIARY OF NEW YORK BASED AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY
c21c020e INTERNATIONAL LEASE FINANCE CORPORATION IS OFFERING FIVE HUNDRED SHARES OF TRANSFERABLE PREFERRED STOCK AT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH
c21c020f THE SHARES CARRY AN INITIAL ANNUAL DIVIDEND RATE OF FOUR POINT SIX TWO FIVE PERCENT
c21c020g A NEW RATE WILL BE SET JUNE EIGHTH AND EVERY FORTY NINE DAYS THEREAFTER THROUGH A DUTCH AUCTION SAID SALOMON BROTHERS INCORPORATED HEAD UNDERWRITER
c21c020h IN A DUTCH AUCTION THE SHARES ARE BOUGHT AND SOLD AT FACE VALUE ONLY THE DIVIDEND RATE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE
c21c020i INTERNATIONAL LEASE AN AIRCRAFT LEASING COMPANY SAID IT WILL USE PROCEEDS FOR GENERAL PURPOSES TO ACQUIRE AIRCRAFT AND TO RETIRE SHORT TERM DEBT
c21c020j THE COMPANY IS BASED IN BEVERLY HILLS CALIFORNIA
c21c020k FOR KODAK A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PENALTY WOULD REPRESENT ONE DOLLAR FIFTY CENTS A SHARE AFTER TAXES
c21c020m BROWN ANALYST OTIS BRADLEY IN A RECENT REPORT
c21c020n YESTERDAY KODAK CLIMBED TWO AND THREE QUARTERS TO SEVENTY FIVE AND THREE EIGHTHS
c21c020o ITS REPORTED FIRST QUARTER PROFIT ROSE TO SEVENTY NINE CENTS A SHARE FROM TWENTY TWO CENTS A SHARE
c21c020p THE COURT DOCUMENTS LIST A SERIES OF MEETINGS TO RAISE FUNDS FOR THE CONTRAS INVOLVING COLONEL NORTH AND MESSRS.
c21c020r AROUND THAT TIME REAGAN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS INCREASINGLY BECAME CONCERNED ABOUT SHORTAGES OF FUNDS AND MILITARY SUPPLIES FOR THE CONTRAS
c21c020s FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD SPOKESMAN JOSEPH COYNE SAID YESTERDAY'S ACTION WAS DONE ENTIRELY AT CITICORP'S INITIATIVE
c21c020t ALTHOUGH FED OFFICIALS WERE ADVISED OF THE BANK'S PLANS IT WAS THEIR OWN JUDGMENT OF WHAT KIND OF RESERVE POSITIONS THEY SHOULD MAKE MR. COYNE SAID
c21c020u WE DON'T CONSIDER THIS A PRECEDENT FOR OTHER BANKS
c21c020v THE IRAN CONTRA PANEL'S BIG SCENE GOT OFF WITH A BANG YESTERDAY <NOISE>
c21c020w LIEUTENANT COLONEL OLLIE NORTH WAS SWORN IN AND BRENDAN SULLIVAN JUNIOR HIS LAWYER PROMPTLY SET OUT TO PROVE THAT WITNESSES CAN TALK BACK AT A CONGRESSIONAL HEARING
c21c020y MOTT'S SAID IT DECIDED TO LEAVE THE SUPERMARKET INDUSTRY BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO COMPETE
c21c020z THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO OWN AND OPERATE TWO RETAIL LIQUOR STORES AND TO HOLD INTERESTS IN SEVERAL SHOPPING CENTERS
c21c0210 THESE BUSINESSES ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT ONE PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S SALES LAST YEAR OF TWO HUNDRED NINETY POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS
c21c0211 SELLING THE CANADIAN BUSINESS WILL HELP T. L. C. GROUP COMPLETE ITS FINANCING ON THE REST OF BEATRICE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
c21c0215 K. MART AND BRUNO'S SAID THEIR HYPERMARKETS WHICH HAVEN'T BEEN NAMED YET WILL INCLUDE SPECIALITY SHOPS
c21c0216 THE FACILITIES WILL COVER ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OR THREE TIMES THE SPACE OF THE AVERAGE K. MART DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT STORE
c21c0217 LOCATED IN MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS THEY WILL BE TOTALLY DISTINCT FROM THE CURRENT OPERATIONS OF BOTH COMPANIES A PREPARED STATEMENT SAID
c21c0218 THE FIRST IS EXPECTED TO OPEN NEXT YEAR
c21c0219 DESPITE ALL THIS THE NEW S. E. C. CHAIRMAN SAYS HE CAN HANDLE THE CHALLENGES FACING THE AGENCY
c21c021a THEY COULDN'T HAVE A BETTER PERSON ON THE JOB AT THIS TIME MR. RUDER SAYS
c21c021c I COME WITH VERY STRONG CONCEPTUAL SKILLS WITH VERY STRONG HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION TO THE REGULATION OF THE SECURITIES MARKETS
c21c021d THE GROUP SAID IN THE FILING THAT IT ACQUIRED THE STOCK FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES
c21c021e A SPOKESMAN FOR THE INVESTOR GROUP DECLINED TO ELABORATE ON THE FILING
c21c021f GREENMAN OFFICIALS WERE UNAVAILABLE FOR COMMENT
c21c021g THE COMPANY WOULD MAKE A TENDER OFFER FOR ITS PREFERRED SHARES AT TWENTY ONE DOLLARS AND FORTY CENTS A SHARE
c21c021h MOST OF THE MORE THAN FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS REQUIRED TO RETIRE THE PREFERRED STOCK WOULD BE BORROWED MR. MOORE SAID
c21c021i AT THE SAME TIME THE COMPANY WOULD RESTRUCTURE EXISTING BANK LOANS
c21c021j FOR A SHIP OR MISSILE GUIDED BY THE WRONG TIME SIGNAL THAT LITTLE GAP COULD MEAN ARRIVING AT THE WRONG DESTINATION
c21c021k IF WE LET THE DIFFERENCE GROW SAYS MR. MCCARTHY WE COULD RUN INTO PROBLEMS OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS
c21c021l IT MIGHT BE NOON BY ATOMIC TIME BUT DARK OUTSIDE
c21c021m THE MOST ACTIVE ISSUE WAS INTEL THE BIG SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANY WHICH ROSE ONE QUARTER TO TWENTY EIGHT AND ONE QUARTER
c21c021n BUT SOME OTHER BIG ELECTRONICS SHARES SURGED LATE IN THE DAY
c21c021o S. C. I. SYSTEMS CLIMBED THREE QUARTERS TO FOURTEEN AND THREE EIGHTHS ON TWO HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SHARES
c21c021p ONE LONGTIME EASTERN PILOT INSISTED THAT THE SAFETY CAMPAIGN INVOLVED NUMEROUS SERIOUS PROBLEMS BUT AFFIRMED THAT THE CARDS OFTEN CONTAINED INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION FOR REGULATORS TO ACT ON
c21c021q I SENT IN SIX CARDS MYSELF THE PILOT SAID INCLUDING SOME INVOLVING INSUFFICIENT TAKEOFF POWER BECAUSE OF MECHANICAL PROBLEMS
c21c021r BUT TO IDENTIFY THE PLANE BY NUMBER OR FLIGHT TIME HE ADDED WOULD BE AN ADMISSION OF OUR OWN CULPABILITY IN THE PROBLEM
c21c021s ANOTHER EASTERN PILOT SAID THAT DESPITE MR. BURNLEY'S CRITICISM HE CONSIDERED THE CAMPAIGN A SUCCESS
c21c021t INOPERATIVE ITEMS THAT ONCE PERSISTED FOR WEEKS ARE BEING REPAIRED MORE CONSISTENTLY HE SAID
c21c021u AFTER LARRY SPEAKES LOST HIS JOB WITH MERRILL LYNCH I WAS A LITTLE RELUCTANT TO JOIN THE POSSE OF CRITICS
c21c021v YOU HATE TO KICK A GUY WHEN HE'S DOWN
c21c021w BUT SOMETHING MADE ME CHANGE MY MIND
c21c021x I READ HIS BOOK
c21c021y BUT SENATOR DAVID BOREN D. OKLAHOMA THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WAS LESS OPTIMISTIC
c21c021z THIS IS NO WAY TO BEGIN A RELATIONSHIP UNDER A TREATY AS IMPORTANT AS THIS IF THESE DELIBERATE AMBIGUITIES REMAIN HE TOLD REPORTERS
c21c0220 SENATOR COHEN ALSO SAID HE IS LESS OPTIMISTIC THAT THE U. S. SOVIET DIFFERENCES CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY
c21c0221 MR. GORBACHEV'S EFFORTS TO MODERNIZE THE SOVIET ECONOMY RAISE THE PROSPECTS OF WIDENING COMMERCIAL TIES BETWEEN EAST AND WEST
c21c0222 MOSCOW'S DECISION TO WITHDRAW FROM AFGHANISTAN HAS REDUCED U. S. FEARS OF SOVIET EXPANSION
c21c0223 MOST IMPORTANT MR. REAGAN LIKE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER MARGARET THATCHER FINDS THAT HE CAN DEAL WITH MR. GORBACHEV
c21c0224 THE SUPERPOWER CHIEFS HAVE NEGOTIATED ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENTS AND TALKED OF ENDING THE ARMS RACE
c21c0225 THE FOLLOWING OFFICERS DIRECTORS AND LARGE STOCKHOLDERS OF COMPANIES REPORTED CHANGES IN HOLDINGS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR
c21c0226 THOSE IDENTIFIED AS BENEFICIAL OWNERS HOLD AT LEAST TEN PERCENT OF A COMPANY'S EQUITY SECURITIES
c21c0227 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED CHANGES INVOLVED DIRECT HOLDINGS OF COMMON STOCK AND TOOK PLACE IN MAY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
c21c0228 COMPANIES ARE LISTED WHERE TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY AGGREGATE TEN THOUSAND SHARES OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
c21c0229 THUS INSTEAD OF CALMAT'S BEING ACQUIRED SELECT ASSETS WOULD BE OPTIONED AND A HUNK OF STOCK WOULD BE IN RELATIVELY SAFE HANDS
c21c022a CALMAT WOULD BE RID OF MR. BRIERLEY WHO APPEARS TO HAVE TRIED TO PUT THE COMPANY IN PLAY
c21c022b INDUSTRIAL EQUITY EXECUTIVES IN CALIFORNIA DIDN'T RETURN CALLS SEEKING COMMENT
c21c022c PERNOD SAYS THE FYFFES SHARE WOULD GIVE IT CONTROL OF MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF IRISH DISTILLERS STOCK
c21c022d IF THE COURT DEEMS THE ORAL AGREEMENT INVALID THE BIDDING WOULD REOPEN
c21c022e BUT REGARDLESS OF THE COURT DECISION THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY COMMISSION OR IRELAND'S FAIR TRADE COMMISSION COULD BLOCK ANY BID
c21c022f NOT SINCE THE NINETEEN THIRTIES HAVE CITIZENS PLACED SO MANY INITIATIVES ON STATE BALLOTS
c21c022g MORE THAN SIXTY BALLOT MEASURES RANGING FROM OPEN PIT MINING TO GOVERNMENT ETHICS TO PAROLE REFORM WILL CONFRONT VOTERS IN MORE THAN HALF THE STATES
c21c022h WHY THE EXPLOSION IN DIRECT DEMOCRACY
c21c022i A BIG REASON WE SUSPECT IS THAT LEGISLATORS ARE INCREASINGLY UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO DEAL WITH ISSUES THAT VOTERS CONSIDER IMPORTANT
c21c022j NOT ALL BLACK COLLEGES ARE ON THE ROPES
c21c022k IN FACT A NUMBER OF ELITE INSTITUTIONS ARE THRIVING IN PART BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL FUND RAISING EFFORTS
c21c022l LAST WEEK FOR INSTANCE MR. COSBY AND HIS WIFE CAMILLE DONATED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SPELMAN COLLEGE A BLACK WOMEN'S COLLEGE IN ATLANTA
c22c0201 OCTOBER'S CONTRACTING FOR TRANSPORTATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRUCTION SURGED THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT TO AN ANNUAL RATE OF FORTY FOUR POINT THREE NINE BILLION DOLLARS FOLLOWING A SHARP DECLINE IN SEPTEMBER
c22c0202 THE RALLY IN PUBLIC WORKS CONSTRUCTION DOMINATED THE MONTH'S ACTIVITY
c22c0203 MODEST GAINS IN HOME BUILDING WERE OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION
c22c0204 MR. ABBOUD ALSO GAINED A REPUTATION DURING THE FIRST CHICAGO YEARS AS BEING ABRASIVE AND SOMETIMES HARSH WITH SUBORDINATES AND THAT TAG HAS LINGERED
c22c0205 I'VE NEVER SEEN AN ADJECTIVE USED SO MUCH IN CONNECTION WITH A PERSON'S NAME HE SAID IN A NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR INTERVIEW
c22c0206 PEOPLE THINK THE A. IN A. ROBERT ABBOUD STANDS FOR ABRASIVE
c22c0207 BEING ENGLISH AND A WORKING CLASS NORTH LONDONER AT THAT IS A BIG PART OF MISS FOX'S APPEAL IN BRITAIN WHERE CLASS DISTINCTIONS STILL COUNT
c22c0208 THERE'S NOTHING PATRICIAN ABOUT HER LOOKS WHICH SUITS HER FANS HERE JUST FINE
c22c0209 A LOT OF YOUNG WOMEN HERE LOOK A LOT LIKE HER
c22c020a EVEN MORE SOUND LIKE HER
c22c020b AND NO ONE EXPECTS OR WANTS HER TO SUDDENLY DON SNOOTY JASPER CONRAN FROCKS AND POSE ON THE PAGES OF VOGUE
c22c020c BUT SIX YEARS OF HUGE TRADE DEFICITS AND BUDGET DEFICITS HAVE CHANGED ALL THAT
c22c020d BY THE END OF LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT SAYS FOREIGNERS HELD TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS MORE IN U. S. ASSETS THAN AMERICANS HELD OVERSEAS
c22c020e SOME ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS DOUBT THE ACCURACY OF THOSE NUMBERS BUT NO ONE QUESTIONS THE TREND
c22c020f IT'S UNCLEAR HOWEVER WHETHER THE TARGET COMPANY WILL SET A PATTERN SETTLEMENT BECAUSE FORD IS FAR MORE PROFITABLE THAN G. M.
c22c020g ONE INDICATION THAT PATTERN BARGAINING MAY BE BREAKING DOWN IS THE WIDE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO AUTO MAKERS' INITIAL PROPOSALS
c22c020h IN THE PAST BOTH COMPANIES HAVE PRESENTED VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL OFFERS ON THE SAME DAY
c22c020i A BIG COMPANY WOULD JUST HAVE CONTINUED WITH THE SAME BAD TEAM HE EXPLAINS
c22c020j THEY WASTE HUGE AMOUNTS
c22c020k THAT'S WHY WE AREN'T AT A DISADVANTAGE WITH THEM
c22c020l I. R. E. HAS DOWNSIZED ITS REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION BUSINESS AND IS PRIMARILY A SAVINGS AND LOAN HOLDING COMPANY MR. LEVAN SAID
c22c020m EARNINGS IN THE PAST WERE SOMEWHAT ERRATIC QUARTER TO QUARTER BECAUSE THE MAJOR BUSINESS WAS REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION
c22c020n NOW THE S. AND L. HOLDING COMPANY IS THE MAIN BUSINESS WITH DOWN SIZED REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION
c22c020o CORE EARNINGS ARE VERY CONSISTENT
c22c020p IN A STATEMENT TIMEPLEX SAID ITS DIRECTORS VOTED TO POSTPONE THE ANNUAL MEETING WHICH WAS SCHEDULED FOR YESTERDAY
c22c020q A NEW DATE HASN'T BEEN SET
c22c020r A UNISYS SPOKESMAN SAID THE COMPANIES HOPE TO COMPLETE THE ACQUISITION WHICH REQUIRES TIMEPLEX HOLDERS' APPROVAL AND GOVERNMENT CLEARANCE IN ABOUT FOUR MONTHS
c22c020s LAST WEEK'S ANNUAL DINNER LUNCHEONS AND OTHER FUNCTIONS OF THE BRITISH INSTITUTE OF PETROLEUM WERE CROWDED TO CAPACITY
c22c020t THE SCORES OF PRIVATE MEETINGS AND PARTIES WERE AS LIVELY AS EVER

c25c0203 MR. TRUMP'S DEMAND THAT THE GOLDEN NUGGET PURCHASE BE BLOCKED CAME AS PART OF A COUNTERSUIT HE FILED AGAINST BALLY IN DECEMBER CHALLENGING A BALLY FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING PLAN
c25c0204 BALLY HAD EARLIER SUED MR. TRUMP ALLEGING VARIOUS SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS
c25c0205 THE C. I. A. USED AN ABANDONED AIR BASE IN SOUTHERN ZAIRE TO AIRLIFT ARMS TO GUERRILLAS IN ANGOLA THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTED

c25c0208 THE OPERATING RATE IS STILL KIND OF LOW BUT IT'S COMING BACK SAID PRISCILLA LUCE SENIOR ECONOMIST AT WHARTON ECONOMETRIC FORECASTING ASSOCIATES IN PHILADELPHIA
c25c0209 THERE IS SOME CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM
c25c020a SHE SAID EXPORT GAINS HAVE SPURRED SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENT
c25c020b AS HE HAD DONE FOR THE PAST FOUR MONTHS THE PRESIDENT INSISTED THAT HE HAD SOLD ARMS IN AN ATTEMPT TO FOSTER A STRATEGIC OPENING TO IRAN
c25c020c BUT HE CONCEDED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT WHAT BEGAN AS A STRATEGIC OPENING TO IRAN DETERIORATED IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION INTO TRADING ARMS FOR HOSTAGES
c25c020d THIS RUNS COUNTER TO MY OWN BELIEFS TO ADMINISTRATION POLICY AND TO THE ORIGINAL STRATEGY WE HAD IN MIND
c25c020e THE PAYMENT DISPUTE WITH YAMAHA WILL BE A CRITICAL PART OF THE INVESTIGATION HE SAID
c25c020f SPECIFICALLY THE FEDERAL AGENCIES WILL BE EXAMINING HOW AND WHY YAMAHA WITHDREW A PROMISSORY NOTE IT HAD ISSUED TO ENDOTRONICS TO PAY FOR THE EQUIPMENT MR. HATCH SAID
c25c020g DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME HE SAID SOME OF ENDOTRONICS'S SALES MAY NOT HAVE BEEN SALES

c25c020k THAT GUY GIVES GREAT ADVICE
c25c020m THAT WON'T HAPPEN SOON IF EVER

c25c020o CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION IS THE POT AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW FOR BOXING'S BIGGEST FIGHTS
c25c020p IT PROVIDED FOR INSTANCE THE LARGEST SLICE OF THE RECORD SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS ESTIMATED GROSS FROM THE RECENT SUGAR RAY LEONARD MARVIN HAGLER BOUT
c25c020q MEANWHILE YOUNG HEAVYWEIGHT SENSATION MIKE TYSON PROMISES TO GENERATE CLOSED CIRCUIT QUALITY FIGHTS FOR YEARS TO COME
c25c020r MORE TRADITIONAL ACADEMICS SAY MANY OF THE NEWER JOURNALS ARE MERELY PLATFORMS FOR MARGINAL SCHOLARS TO WRITE ON TRIVIAL TOPICS
c25c020t BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE WHO PUBLISH SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT WOULDN'T WANT TO PUBLISH IN THE LEADING JOURNALS
c25c020u THE DENVER PURCHASE REPRESENTS THE THIRD MAJOR ACQUISITION MR. SINGLETON'S COMPANY HAS MADE IN MARKETS WITH DEPRESSED OIL AND REAL ESTATE ECONOMIES
c25c020v HE SAID HE BELIEVED THE OIL ECONOMY HAS BOTTOMED OUT AND IS SHOWING SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENTS
c25c020w THREE YEARS FROM NOW THESE WILL ALL BE OUTSTANDING MARKETS HE PROJECTED
c25c020x THESE ARE LONG TERM PLAYS
c25c020z ALREADY THE LEVEL OF TRADES IN WHICH THE TERMS ARE IN DISPUTE IS RUNNING AT A RELATIVELY HIGH LEVEL SAID MR. LEIBLER
c25c0210 BOTH THE BIG BOARD AND AMEX SAID THEY ARE CONSIDERING CALLING PEOPLE INTO WORK SATURDAY TO HELP PROCESS THIS WEEK'S ACTIVITY
c25c0211 THE CONVERTIBLE FEATURE IN THE BONDS WAS AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION
c25c0212 IF THE STOCK PROSPERED THE BONDHOLDERS DID NOT HAVE THE OPTION OF CASHING IN AND TAKING THE GAIN
c25c0213 NO ONE HAD SUGGESTED ROGERS WAS ABOUT TO GO BANKRUPT AND DEFAULT ON ITS BONDS THE ONLY WAY THE INTEREST COULD BE JEOPARDIZED
c25c0214 SO WHEN MR. GINSBURG FILED HIS BRIEF HE HAD NOTHING TO LOSE OR GAIN FROM ITS EFFECT ON ROGERS'S FORTUNES
c25c0215 MR. CHEN LEFT CRAY IN SEPTEMBER AFTER IT SCRAPPED HIS LATEST DESIGN PROJECT WHICH IT TERMED TOO COSTLY AND SPECULATIVE
c25c0216 MR. CHEN WAS CONSIDERING USING LASERS RATHER THAN WIRES IN THAT MACHINE
c25c0217 BUT WHILE CRAY GRANTED MR. CHEN PERSONAL NONEXCLUSIVE USE OF HIS DEVELOPMENTS THERE HIS NEW COMPANY SAID IT DOESN'T INTEND TO USE CRAY TECHNOLOGY
c25c0218 TECHNICALLY THE STOPGAP BILL WILL LEAVE THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF MONEY OVER THE WEEKEND
c25c0219 BUT THAT SHOULD HAVE LITTLE PRACTICAL EFFECT SINCE MOST OPERATIONS WILL BE CLOSED DURING THAT TIME
c25c021a CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS HOPE HOWEVER IT WILL PRESSURE LAWMAKERS TO FINISH THEIR WORK BEFORE MONDAY
c25c021b THE SEVEN SIGNATORIES HAVE AGREED TO POLICIES AIMED AT REDUCING THEIR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL IMBALANCES
c25c021c THUS THEY ARE MAKING A CONTRIBUTION TO STABILIZING THEIR EXCHANGE RELATIONS JEOPARDIZED BY THE HIGHLY EXCESSIVE DEFICITS AND SURPLUSES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED IN RECENT YEARS
c25c021d MOREOVER THEY ARE READY IF NEED BE TO INTERVENE ON EXCHANGE MARKETS
c25c021e AMONG POSSIBLE BUYERS FOR THE CANADIAN FOOD OPERATIONS ARE PROVIGO INCORPORATED AND METRO RICHELIEU INCORPORATED BOTH MONTREAL BASED SUPERMARKET CONCERNS
c25c021g METRO RICHELIEU OFFICIALS WOULDN'T COMMENT ON THE POSSIBLE SALE OF THE STEINBERG OPERATION
c25c021i ATLANTIC RESEARCH HAS ALREADY IDENTIFIED A POSSIBLE SITE FOR A GOVERNMENT OWNED PLANT
c25c021j THE SITE IS IN MISSISSIPPI WHICH HAPPENS TO BE THE HOME STATE OF TWO KEY MEMBERS OF CONGRESSIONAL APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEES
c25c021k N. A. S. A. IS ALSO CONSIDERING THE KENNEDY SPACE CENTER IN DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATIVE WILLIAM NELSON'S DISTRICT

c25c021m IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN MY SON DIED FOLLOWING A SECOND LIVER TRANSPLANT
c25c021n WE DONATED HIS CORNEAS AND I THANK GOD FOR THAT ONE POSITIVE RESULT FROM HIS DEATH
c25c021o I KNOW OF MANY DONOR FAMILIES WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME POSITIVE EXPERIENCE
c25c021p TALKS OF BIG BUSINESS INVENTORY TURNS MIGHT HAVE SOUNDED STRANGE IN HIS PARENTS' HOME
c25c021q MR. KAVNER WAS BORN IN FRANKLIN SQUARE N. Y. A LONG ISLAND SUBURB OF NEW YORK CITY
c25c021r HIS LATE FATHER WAS A FACTORY WORKER MAKING CHEAP METAL PLATED TROPHIES HIS MOTHER WAS A HOUSEWIFE
c25c021t FRETTING ABOUT FINANCES MOST COMPANIES ARE TAKING FEWER CREATIVE RISKS
c25c021u AUDIENCES IN TURN HAVE GROWN MORE CONSERVATIVE
c25c021v YET THERE'S MORE WORK PERFORMED NOW THAN IN YEARS MAINLY TO KEEP REVENUES FLOWING
c25c021x BESIDES NARROWING THE PRICE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WOOD AND METAL SYSTEMS THESE TECHNIQUES PROVIDED THE PRECISION NEEDED IN DESIGNING PANEL SYSTEMS THAT MUST FIT TOGETHER
c25c021y ALMOST ALL THE MAJOR OFFICE FURNITURE MANUFACTURERS HAVE ACQUIRED THE ABILITY TO MAKE WOOD SYSTEMS IN RECENT YEARS
c25c021z MANA SAID OTAIBA THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES OIL MINISTER HAD BEEN MENTIONED AS THE POSSIBLE NEW PRESIDENT
c25c0220 HE HAS HELD THE POSITION THREE TIMES IN THE PAST AND WAS BELIEVED EAGER TO HEAD OPEC AGAIN
c25c0222 THE ONLY NEW ISSUE PRICED YESTERDAY WAS FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF TWELVE YEAR SENIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES FROM U. S. G. CORPORATION
c25c0225 INDEED NO CHANGES ARE LIKELY SOON BECAUSE THE WHOLESALERS AND SMALL RETAILERS THAT BENEFIT FROM THE EXISTING SYSTEM ARE WELL ORGANIZED BACKERS OF THE RULING LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY
c25c0226 THE JAPANESE DEBATE ON THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM BEGAN ONLY RECENTLY
c25c0227 EVEN AFTER A CONSENSUS IS REACHED NEW LEGISLATION MAY HAVE TO BE DRAFTED AND ENACTED
c25c0228 IN THE CURRENT DEBATE MR. BUSH IS USING THE A. C. L. U. TO PIN A LIBERAL LABEL ON HIS DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER
c25c0229 BUT THE A. C. L. U. HAS RELIED THROUGHOUT MUCH OF ITS HISTORY ON REPUBLICAN SUPPORT AND HAS ALLIED ITSELF WITH REPUBLICANS ON NUMEROUS ISSUES
c25c022a IN THE CURRENT CONTROVERSY SOME REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO MINIMIZE THEIR PAST INVOLVEMENT
c25c022b MR. TURNER MAY EVEN KNOW ALL THIS BECAUSE HIS PROTECTIONIST ARDOR IS QUITE RECENT
c25c022c IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES HE WAS A GLOBALLY MINDED FINANCE MINISTER UNDER PIERRE TRUDEAU
c25c022e LIKE RICHARD GEPHARDT AND SOME OTHER U. S. DEMOCRATS MR. TURNER MUST BELIEVE PROTECTIONISM IS A HOT BUTTON TO POLITICAL OFFICE
c25c022f WHY THIS INCREDIBLE DIVERSION OF EFFORT TO CRIMES THAT OFTEN ARE NOT CLEARLY DEFINED BY STATUTE AND WHERE IDENTIFIABLE VICTIMS ARE SELDOM FOUND
c25c022g MAYBE TOO MANY OF TODAY'S PROSECUTORS WERE INFLUENCED BY THE PREVAILING COUNTERCULTURE SUSPICIONS OF MIDDLE CLASS MORALITY DURING THEIR LAW SCHOOL DAYS
c25c022i THE LAST QUESTION WAS ALL BUT IGNORED
c25c022j ALMOST EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF LABEL AGREED THAT THIS WAS A DEFICIT THAT REALLY WASN'T A DEFICIT
c25c022k THAT AUTOMATICALLY MEANT NO ONE WAS DEALING WITH THE QUESTION AS SERIOUS ADULTS REPRESENTING EQUALLY SERIOUS CONSTITUENTS
c26c0201 MOBS OF HINDUS RAMPAGED THROUGH NEW DELHI AND BATTLED SIKHS OVER A BUS HIJACKING SUNDAY IN WHICH SIKH EXTREMISTS KILLED TWENTY FOUR HINDUS
c26c0202 POLICE REPORTED ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED ARRESTS AS THEY ATTEMPTED TO CONTROL THE SIXTEEN THOUSAND HINDU RIOTERS IN THE INDIAN CAPITAL
c26c0203 THE RIOTING ERUPTED DURING A GENERAL STRIKE CALLED TO PROTEST A RECENT WAVE OF KILLINGS
c26c0204 THE COMPUTER ALSO CAN DISPLAY A PATTERN SHOWING HOW PEOPLE NORMALLY PLACE THE TONGUE TO PRODUCE SAY AN S. SOUND
c26c0205 A DEAF PERSON CAN THEN TRY TO MATCH THE PATTERN BY PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ELECTRONIC PALATE
c26c0206 WITH CAREFUL COACHING AND TRIAL AND ERROR CHILDREN LIKE MISS GILROY CAN LEARN HOW TO MAKE SOUNDS THAT REQUIRE PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH
c26c0207 THE BANKS SOUGHT TO ELIMINATE A MISMATCH BETWEEN THEIR ASSETS PREDOMINANTLY HELD IN NON POUND CURRENCIES AND THEIR CAPITAL KEPT IN POUNDS
c26c0208 WHEN THE POUND WAS WEAK DURING THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE VALUE OF THE SCANDINAVIAN BANK'S CAPITAL FELL STEEPLY IN PROPORTION TO ITS NON DOLLAR ASSETS
c26c0209 THE BANKS THAT OWNED SCANDINAVIAN BANK HAD TO INJECT ABOUT FORTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL
c26c020a TO GET ITS MESSAGE TO MADISON AVENUE DECISION MAKERS WHITTLE COMMUNICATIONS HAS BEEN RUNNING A SERIES OF SLICK ADS IN NEWSPAPERS AND MEDIA TRADE JOURNALS
c26c020b WE'RE WASTING A LOT OF MONEY ON THIS AD ANNOUNCES A BOLD HEADLINE IN ONE
c26c020c THE POINT VIRTUALLY EVERY ADVERTISER IN EVERY MEDIUM IS PAYING TO REACH VIEWERS OR READERS WHO NEVER BECOME CUSTOMERS
c26c020d FOR EXAMPLE EXERCISE
c26c020e THE OLDER PERSON WHO FEELS THAT HE IS JUST WAITING FOR THE END LIKELY WON'T BE MOTIVATED TO GET OUT AND BE ACTIVE
c26c020f BUT SCIENCE STILL IS COUNTING THE BENEFITS FOR THOSE WHO ARE
c26c020g INDEED MANY OF THE MALADIES OF AGING CAN BE REVERSED AS WITH OSTEOPOROSIS THE LOSS OF BONE STRENGTH THAT PARTICULARLY PLAGUES OLDER WOMEN
c26c020h STUDIES SHOW A GAIN IN BONE MASS AMONG OLDER PEOPLE IN EXERCISE PROGRAMS
c26c020i A YEAR EARLIER G. M. HUGHES HAD FIRST QUARTER PROFIT OF ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS OR SEVENTY SEVEN CENTS A SHARE
c26c020j PER SHARE EARNINGS FOR THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX QUARTERS BENEFITED FROM THIRTY SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF GOODWILL AMORTIZATION IN EACH PERIOD
c26c020l THAT ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT REPRESENTS A CHARGE AGAINST G. M.'S EARNINGS
c26c020m LORIMAR TELEPICTURES FELL ONE AND ONE QUARTER TO SIXTEEN
c26c020n THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A BUYBACK PROGRAM FOR AS MUCH AS FIFTEEN PERCENT OF COMMON SHARES AND A RESTRUCTURING TO FOCUS ON ITS CORE ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION BUSINESSES

c26c020p THOSE CREDITORS INCLUDE MULTILATERAL AGENCIES LATIN AMERICAN AND SOME EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS AND SHORT TERM COMMERCIAL BANK CREDITORS AND SUPPLIERS
c26c020q PERU RECENTLY RESUMED DEBT PAYMENTS TO THE INTER AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
c26c020r BUT THERE AREN'T ANY CURRENT PLANS TO RESUME PAYMENTS TO THE WORLD BANK OR THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE ADVISER SAID
c26c020s SHARON'S BOARD FOUGHT THE ACQUISITION VIGOROUSLY TO NO AVAIL
c26c020t EVENTUALLY SHARON SHAREHOLDERS TENDERED EIGHTY SIX PERCENT OF THEIR SHARES GIVING N. V. F. CONTROL
c26c020v AN EMBITTERED MR. PERRAULT LEFT THREE MONTHS LATER
c26c020x IT HAS BEEN INDISCREET ON BOTH ENDS OF PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE
c26c020y IF I HAD DIVULGED WHAT I WAS DOING MANY MANY LIVES WERE AT STAKE
c26c020z MOST OF THE DAMAGE TO STOCK PRICES CAME IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AS BOND PRICES SAGGED ADDING FUEL TO THE FIRE OF INTEREST RATE FEARS
c26c0210 BONDS IN TURN SEEMED TO BE REACTING TO A DECLINE IN THE DOLLAR OFF ITS HIGHS EARLY IN THE DAY
c26c0211 THE DOLLAR NEVERTHELESS SHOWED A GAIN FOR THE DAY AGAINST BOTH THE YEN AND THE WEST GERMAN MARK
c26c0212 THE CONVERTIBLE FEATURE IN THE BONDS WAS AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION
c26c0213 IF THE STOCK PROSPERED THE BONDHOLDERS DID NOT HAVE THE OPTION OF CASHING IN AND TAKING THE GAIN
c26c0214 NO ONE HAS SUGGESTED ROGERS WAS ABOUT TO GO BANKRUPT AND DEFAULT ON ITS BONDS THE ONLY WAY THE INTEREST COULD BE JEOPARDIZED
c26c0215 SO WHEN MR. GINSBURG FILED HIS BRIEF HE HAD NOTHING TO LOSE OR GAIN FROM ITS EFFECTS ON ROGERS'S FORTUNES
c26c0217 AFTER HIGH PRICES AND FRANTIC BIDDING AT ART AUCTIONS LAST SPRING ABOUT ONE IN FOUR WORKS DIDN'T SELL AT A CONTEMPORARY ART AUCTION AT CHRISTIE'S
c26c0218 BUT AT LEAST THE MARKET DIDN'T CRASH
c26c0219 HE HELPED US TO LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS SAYS ALFRED S. WARREN THE G. M. VICE PRESIDENT LEADING THE NEGOTIATIONS UNDER MR. JOHNSON
c26c021a HE WAS VERY REFRESHING IN SOME OF HIS THOUGHTS AND IDEAS
c26c021b BUT THE IDEAS NEVER BECAME REALITY
c26c021c G. M. EVENTUALLY SIGNED A TRADITIONAL PACT PATTERNED CLOSELY AFTER FORD'S
c26c021d YESTERDAY PEOPLE CLOSE TO FEDERATED'S BOARD SAID THAT THE COMPANY WAS STILL OPEN TO YET ANOTHER FRIENDLY MERGER PROPOSAL FROM CAMPEAU
c26c021e IF THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW US WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT
c26c021f THEY KNOW WHERE TO FIND US SAID ONE SOURCE
c26c021g WE'RE NOT STONEWALLING THEM
c26c021h ALTHOUGH MY TENTH MOVE HAD SET A STANDARD TRAP THREATENING TO WIN HIS KING PAWN MR. KASPAROV HAD TAKEN COUNTERMEASURES
c26c021i IT IS SOON APPARENT THAT I AM PRESENTING HIM WITH NO DIFFICULTIES MEANWHILE HE CONTROLS MORE SQUARES
c26c021j WHILE HE IS TAKING LONG THINKS OFTEN MORE THAN ONE MINUTE AGAINST MR. BONIN HE USUALLY MOVES INSTANTLY AGAINST ME
c26c021k MY ERRONEOUS QUEEN MANEUVER SENDS THE CHAMPION INTO HIS FIRST LONG STARE AT MY BOARD

c26c021p HOPING TO TRANSFORM THE STATIST PHILIPPINES INTO ASIA'S NEXT TIGER ECONOMY HE SERENADED HIS NEGOTIATING TEAM WITH THE OLD MELODY WE'RE ALMOST THERE
c26c021q ALTHOUGH INFLATION HAS SLOWED INVESTMENT AND DOMESTIC DEMAND ECONOMISTS NOW BELIEVE A WIDELY PREDICTED DEEP RECESSION HAS BEEN AVOIDED
c26c021r INDEED A POWERFUL EXPORT BOOM ILLUSTRATING ONCE AGAIN THAT BRAZILIAN INDUSTRY IS GEARED TO SELL ABROAD AND ADJUST RAPIDLY IS FUELING A MILD RECOVERY
c26c021s IF INFLATION DOESN'T GO ANY HIGHER ANALYSTS BELIEVE THIS COULD BE MAINTAINED
c26c021t THIS WAS ROUGH ON ALL DEBTORS DOMESTIC AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL
c26c021u BUT NO ONE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS FOR DOMESTIC DEBTORS AS GRAND AS THOSE OFFICIALLY OFFERED FOR THE THIRD WORLD DEBTORS
c26c021v THE FIRST PART OF THE OFFICIAL PROPOSAL WAS TO REDUCE THE INTEREST BURDEN OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
c26c021w SECOND PROMOTE WORLD ECONOMIC RECOVERY
c26c021x THIRD NEW LOANS SHOULD BE MADE TO THE DEBTOR NATIONS BY THE BANKS THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE WORLD BANK AND EXPORT CREDIT AGENCIES
c26c021y MR. LLOYD SAYS HE HAS STARTED SELLING OFF HIS HOLDINGS TOO IN LINE WITH A FAMILY DECISION SIX MONTHS AGO
c26c021z BUT DON'T THINK FOR A MINUTE THAT HE'S LOSING INTEREST
c26c0220 A FEW MONTHS AGO HE HAPPENED UPON SOME MEN FILLING A CAR TRUNK WITH HIS GRAPEFRUIT
c26c0221 THE MEN WERE UNDETERRED BY HIS GRANDFATHERLY LOOKS
c26c0223 MS. SAVITCH WAS HYPER AMBITIOUS TROUBLED AND UNPOPULAR
c26c0224 SHE HAD CHARM IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA AN EXPERTLY CRAFTED FACADE BUT INSIDE SHE WAS IN TURMOIL
c26c0225 SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD THE PEACE IN DEATH THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE IN LIFE BUT FOR THIS BOOK AND ANOTHER ONE ABOUT HER DUE OUT SOON
c26c0226 NOW STUNG BY THE RECENT DEBT LADEN TAKEOVERS SOME FUND MANAGERS ARE PLANNING TO DUMP INDUSTRIAL BONDS
c26c0227 OTHERS WILL REDUCE THEIR EXPOSURE TO THEM
c26c0228 WHAT MANY ARE BUYING INSTEAD BONDS ISSUED BY UTILITIES BANKS AND FOREIGN COMPANIES THOSE WITH THE LEAST CHANCE OF BEING BOUGHT OUT
c26c0229 OTHERS ARE BUYING SAFER TREASURY BONDS WHOSE YIELDS ARE A PERCENTAGE OR LESS BELOW TOP GRADE INDUSTRIAL DEBT
c26c022a A. YES WITHOUT QUESTION
c26c022b IT'S MY SENSE THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY COULD TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION WITH ABSOLUTE IMPUNITY
c26c022c AND THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE
c26c022d NOW I AM CERTAIN THAT THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CAN TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION AND GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE THEY'RE SMARTER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON
c26c022e THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THOSE PEOPLE
c26c022f BUT I THINK THAT THE ACTIONS HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON CONDUCT
c26c022g MR. YEUTTER MEANWHILE SAID THE U. S. IS STILL VIGOROUSLY OPPOSED TO THE E. C.'S CALL FOR A REBALANCING OF TARIFFS ON FARM PRODUCTS
c26c022h IN EXCHANGE FOR ACCEPTING SOME TARIFF REDUCTIONS THE COMMUNITY WANTS TO BE ALLOWED TO IMPOSE TARIFFS ON PRODUCTS THAT CURRENTLY ENTER THE E. C. DUTY FREE
c26c022i THESE INCLUDE MAJOR U. S. EXPORTS TO THE E. C. SUCH AS SOYBEANS AND CORN GLUTEN
c27c0201 IN RECENT YEARS HOWEVER INSIDER TRADING CASES HAVE SOMETIMES INVOLVED PEOPLE WHO ARE QUITE REMOTE FROM COMPANIES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF INSIDE INFORMATION
c27c0202 SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THE SUPREME COURT HAS SUGGESTED WITHOUT BEING SPECIFIC THAT SUCH CASES MIGHT INVOLVE MISAPPROPRIATION OR ILLEGAL USE OF INFORMATION
c27c0203 A DECISION IN THE WINANS CASE MAY HELP DEFINE SECURITIES FRAUD BY MISAPPROPRIATION
c27c0204 FIRST OF ALL THE POLICY CONSERVATIVES WILL PURSUE THEIR UNFINISHED AGENDA OF DEREGULATION IN AREAS FROM FINANCIAL SERVICES TO REGULATION AS A DRAG ON U. S. INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
c27c0205 THEY SAY THE ADMINISTRATION MISSED ITS CHANCE AND ALLOWED ITS DEREGULATORY CAMPAIGN TO BE ALL BUT ABORTED BY CONTROVERSY OVER ANNE GORSUCH AND JIM WATT
c27c0206 THEY THINK THEIR GENERAL CASE IN THIS AREA IS OVERWHELMING
c27c0207 THEY WILL GIVE IT NEW APPLICATIONS AND CARRY IT TO NEW FORUMS
c27c0208 LAST YEAR SPONSORS OF A STRONG ACID RAIN BILL CLAIMED TO HAVE A TENTATIVE ONE VOTE MAJORITY ON THE COMMITTEE IN FAVOR OF THEIR BILL
c27c0209 THE MEASURE WAS CO SPONSORED BY ONE THIRD OF THE HOUSE AND SUPPORT APPEARED TO BE GROWING
c27c020a REPRESENTATIVE DINGELL WHOSE DISTRICT'S STEEL AND AUTO INDUSTRIES OPPOSED THE BILL BOTTLED IT UP IN THE COMMITTEE
c27c020b THE BANKS HAVE WATCHED IN DISMAY AS BRAZIL'S LEADERS HAVE ALLOWED ITS ECONOMY TO DRIFT TOWARD RECESSION
c27c020c INFLATION IS CURRENTLY RUNNING AT EIGHT HUNDRED PERCENT ANNUAL RATE GROWTH HAS SLOWED AND ITS TRADE BALANCE IS DETERIORATING
c27c020d BANKERS ARE ALSO SKEPTICAL OF PRESIDENT SARNEY'S CLAIM FRIDAY THAT BRAZIL'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND GOLD RESERVES ARE AS HIGH AS THREE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS

c27c020u HE TELLS THE STORY OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SALOON FOUR COWBOYS PUT UP THEIR BELONGINGS AS COLLATERAL TO BORROW A DECK OF CARDS
c27c020v THE HITCH IS THAT EACH OF THE FOUR MUST BRING BACK FOURTEEN CARDS AT THE END OF THE EVENING A MATHEMATICAL IMPOSSIBILITY
c27c020w IN THE END ONE PLAYER ENDS UP WITH ONLY TEN CARDS AND LOSES HIS BELONGINGS
c27c020x IT WAS OUT OF CONCERN FOR SUCH EIGHT YEAR OLDS THAT CONGRESS HAS OUTLAWED CHILD PORNOGRAPHY LAWS UPHELD BY THE SUPREME COURT
c27c020y SIMILARLY THE SUPREME COURT HAS SAID OBSCENE MATERIAL IS UNPROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT
c27c020z AND IT DEFINED THAT AS DEPICTIONS OF ULTIMATE SEXUAL ACTS IN WORKS THAT LACK SERIOUS LITERARY ARTISTIC POLITICAL OR SCIENTIFIC VALUE
c27c0210 A BIG COMPANY WOULD JUST HAVE CONTINUED WITH THE SAME BAD TEAM HE EXPLAINS
c27c0211 THEY WASTE HUGE AMOUNTS
c27c0212 THAT'S WHY WE AREN'T AT A DISADVANTAGE WITH THEM
c27c0213 IN A FOREST NEAR HERE THIRTY PEOPLE ARE STANDING IN A CIRCLE WITH THEIR HANDS AROUND EACH OTHER'S SHOULDERS
c27c0214 THEY ALL TURN SIDEWAYS AND PLOP DOWN ON EACH OTHER'S LAPS
c27c0215 THEN EACH GIVES THE STRANGER SITTING IN HIS OR HER LAP A BACK MASSAGE

c27c021p IN WASHINGTON STATE A PROPOSAL TO USE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AS COUNSEL ON ALL STATE BOND ISSUES CAME BEFORE A LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE LAST YEAR
c27c021q ITS ADOPTION WOULD HAVE SAVED WASHINGTON MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
c27c021r STRONG OPPOSITION FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE DEFEATED THE PROPOSAL HOWEVER
c27c021s THIS MAY TURN OUT TO BE AN EXTREMELY POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE ALL OF THE TOBACCO MANUFACTURERS WERE INVOLVED IN THE ALLEGED CONSPIRACY MR. DAYNARD SAID
c27c021t THERE IS A LOT OF DAMNING EVIDENCE

c27c0228 IN U. S. FUTURES TRADING SPOT MONTH CRUDE OIL SETTLED BELOW FOURTEEN DOLLARS A BARREL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN TWO YEARS
c27c0229 NOVEMBER WEST TEXAS INTERMEDIATE CLOSED AT THIRTEEN DOLLARS AND NINETY TWO CENTS A BARREL DOWN NINETEEN CENTS
c27c022a RANDOM HOUSE A SUBSIDIARY OF THE NEWHOUSE FAMILY'S ADVANCE PUBLICATIONS INCORPORATED SAID THE MOVE WILL TAKE IT OUT OF THE TEXTBOOK PUBLISHING BUSINESS
c27c022b THE TWO DIVISIONS TOGETHER ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS TO NINETY MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL SALES SAID ROBERT L. BERNSTEIN RANDOM HOUSE CHAIRMAN
c27c022c MR. BERNSTEIN NOTED THAT RANDOM HOUSE HAS EXPANDED IN OTHER DIRECTIONS NOTABLY IN TRADE PUBLISHING
c27c022d TRADE BOOKS ARE ALL BOOKS SOLD DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS IN BOOK STORES AND THROUGH MAIL ORDERS
c27c022e FRANKFURT SHARE PRICES CLOSED MOSTLY LOWER IN MODERATELY ACTIVE TRADING FRIDAY AS AN EARLY RALLY FIZZLED AMID POSITION SQUARING BEFORE THE WEEKEND AND UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE LOWER DOLLAR
c27c022f THE D. A. X. INDEX DROPPED FIVE POINT NINE TO ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE POINT SEVEN TWO
c27c022g AFTER OPENING BROADLY HIGHER THE TIDE TURNED AT MIDDAY WHEN THE DOLLAR'S SLIDE TO A THREE MONTH LOW BEGAN TO WORRY MARKET PARTICIPANTS
c27c022h GET PROFESSIONAL HELP
c27c022i FOR INVESTORS WITH LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THOSE WHO MAY NEED TO SELL THEIR BONDS BEFORE MATURITY MANY ADVISERS SAY TO FORGET INDIVIDUAL BONDS
c27c022j INSTEAD THEY SAY SMALL INVESTORS SHOULD BUY THROUGH MUTUAL FUNDS AND UNIT INVESTMENT TRUSTS
c28c0201 OCTOBER'S CONTRACTING FOR TRANSPORTATION ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRUCTION SURGED THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT TO AN ANNUAL RATE OF FORTY FOUR POINT THREE NINE BILLION DOLLARS FOLLOWING A SHARP DECLINE IN SEPTEMBER
c28c0202 THE RALLY IN PUBLIC WORKS CONSTRUCTION DOMINATED THE MONTH'S ACTIVITY
c28c0203 MODEST GAINS IN HOME BUILDING WERE OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION
c28c0204 INDEED TO INVESTORS ALL SHARES OF THE SAME STOCK ARE ALIKE THE INVESTOR DOESN'T CARE WHICH ONE HE BUYS
c28c0205 BUT TWO EXAMPLES OF THE SAME STAMP ISSUE CAN DIFFER GREATLY IN VALUE DEPENDING ON THE QUALITY OF SAY PERFORATIONS INK OR GLUE
c28c0206 BUYING STAMPS THROUGH A COMPUTER NETWORK SIGHT UNSEEN COULD BE HAZARDOUS
c28c0207 MILAN SHARP GAINS IN THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS GAVE WAY TO SLACKENING SHARE PRICES IN A MORE SELECTIVE MARKET
c28c0208 THE SHARP DOWNTURN IN DECEMBER COULD LEAD TO A WEAK MARKET IN THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THIS YEAR ANALYSTS SAY
c28c0209 <NOISE> ALTHOUGH MARKET LEADERS SUCH AS FIAT AND MONTEDISON RECOVERED LATE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX MOST SHARES ARE WAY BELOW MAY VALUES ONE MILAN BROKER SAID
c28c020a <NOISE> FINANCE MINISTER GERHARD STOLTENBERG HAS REPEATEDLY TIED TAX CUTS TO REDUCING THE DEFICIT AND BALANCING THE BUDGET
c28c020b THAT ATTITUDE REFLECTS THE FISCAL CONSERVATISM OF GERMANY AT LARGE
c28c020c TAX REFORM IS LARGELY DISTRUSTED BECAUSE IT ADDS TO GOVERNMENT DEFICITS WHICH ARE FEARED AS INFLATIONARY
c28c020d PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING ELSE IN MR. O'BRIEN'S JOB AS CHIEF EQUITY TRADER AT WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT ADVISORS IS PART OF A CAREFULLY GUIDED PROCESS
c28c020e A COMPUTER PRINTOUT TELLS HIM WHAT STOCKS TO BUY
c28c020f A DAILY SCRATCH SHEET TELLS HIM WHEN TO BUY AND SELL STOCK INDEX FUTURES
c28c020g THIS IS GREAT SAYS MR. O'BRIEN AS HE FINISHES UP THE FUTURES PURCHASE
c28c020h YOU CAN BE IN AND OUT OF THE MARKET IN FIVE SECONDS
c28c020i MR. WEINBERGER IS NOT ALONE IN THIS REASONING
c28c020j THE DEFENSE PERCENTAGE OF GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT ARGUMENT WHICH APPARENTLY FIRST APPEARED IN THE MID NINETEEN SEVENTIES HAS TAKEN ON A LIFE OF ITS OWN
c28c020k IT IS NOW SO WIDELY ACCEPTED AS A MEASURE THAT IT'S BECOME A PERENNIAL COMPONENT OF THE BUDGET DEBATE
c28c020l INDEED THAT DEBATE HAS INCREASINGLY FEATURED STATISTICS ABOUT THE PERCENT OF G. N. P. BEING SPENT ON EDUCATION HEALTH AND OTHER GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS
c28c020m IT HAS BEEN SHOWN REPEATEDLY THAT THE PUBLIC SUPPORTS THE BASIC IDEA OF DEFENDING THE U. S. FROM INCOMING BALLISTIC MISSILES
c28c020n IF MR. REAGAN WANTS S. D. I. TO BE A LASTING LEGACY OF HIS ADMINISTRATION IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO START BUILDING ON THE SUPPORT THAT ALREADY EXISTS
c28c020o THAT TASK WILL BE MADE EASIER IF THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDES THE DEVELOPING EVIDENCE OF THE SOVIET THREAT
c28c020p ALTHOUGH THE ANTI FRAUD PROVISIONS OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS APPLY TO MUNICIPALS OFFERINGS REGULATION OF THE MARKET IS LARGELY LEFT TO STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS
c28c020q SOME STATES LIKE NEW JERSEY REQUIRE THE FILING OF FINANCIAL REPORTS BY MUNICIPAL ISSUERS WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE MR. TAYLOR NOTES
c28c020r OTHERS HAVE LITTLE OR NO SUPERVISION OF THE LOCAL UNITS
c28c020s PARTS THE SECOND AND THE THIRD ARE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOME INTEREST THAT MAY NOT BE DEDUCTIBLE
c28c020t TAXPAYERS MUST USE THE LONGER MORE COMPLICATED PART THREE IF ANY OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE LOAN WENT FOR TRADE OR BUSINESS EXPENSES
c28c020u GENERALLY THE INTEREST OF THE PORTION OF THE LOAN THAT FINANCES THESE EXPENSES IS DEDUCTIBLE
c28c020v A SPOKESMAN FOR CRAY DESCRIBED THE M. I. T. DECISION AS GOOD NEWS
c28c020w ASSUMING THE BIDDING DOES OPEN UP AGAIN IT MEANS THERE'S ROOM FOR TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND NOT CONSIDERATIONS BASED PURELY ON PRICE
c28c020x THE SPOKESMAN SAID IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR CRAY TO INSTALL AND OPERATE A COMPLETE SUPERCOMPUTER SYSTEM AT THE PRICES M. I. T. WANTED TO PAY
c28c020y BUT WHILE NICKEL AND ESPECIALLY COPPER QUOTES HAVE SINCE REBOUNDED ALUMINUM PRICES HAVE CONTINUED TO TUMBLE
c28c020z IT SEEMS TO BE IN PEOPLE'S INTEREST TO KEEP THE PRICE RIGHT DOWN NOW SAYS ONE LONDON EXCHANGE TRADER
c28c0210 THIS WILL ULTIMATELY GIVE THEM MORE BUYING OPPORTUNITIES DOWN THE LINE
c28c0211 BUT INSIDE ROOM SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTEEN THE JAPANESE SEE THE SITUATION SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY
c28c0212 THEY REASON LIKE THIS IF THE U. S. IMPOSES SANCTIONS THEY MOST LIKELY WILL BE AIMED AT JAPANESE CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN THE U. S.
c28c0213 BUT THAT WOULD HURT THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN WORKERS WHO ARE EMPLOYED EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY SUCH COMPANIES
c28c0214 THE POLITICAL FALLOUT FOR THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION MIGHT BE TOO GREAT TO RISK THAT
c28c0215 IT WAS LEFT TO MODERATOR JAMES P. GANNON EDITOR OF THE DES MOINES REGISTER WHICH SPONSORED THE DEBATE TO BRING UP MR. HART'S INFIDELITY
c28c0216 MR. GANNON REMINDED MR. HART HE HAD TOLD EDITORS OF THE REGISTER THAT IF HE IS ELECTED HE WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST ADULTERER IN THE WHITE HOUSE
c28c0217 MR. GANNON ASKED SHOULD VOTERS IN IOWA IGNORE THESE QUESTIONS OF CHARACTER AND JUDGMENT
c28c0218 DRAMS DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORIES ARE A PARTICULAR EXAMPLE
c28c0219 OUR SYSTEMS GROUP USES THEM ALONG WITH OUR OWN MICROPROCESSORS TO BUILD MICROCOMPUTER SYSTEMS
c28c021a EVEN THOUGH INTEL WAS THE FIRST MANUFACTURER OF SUCH DEVICES WE ALONG WITH MOST OTHER U. S. MANUFACTURERS STOPPED MAKING THEM YEARS AGO
c28c021b TODAY A U. S. DRAM IS PRACTICALLY AN EXTINCT SPECIES
c28c021c GORDON PYE CHIEF ECONOMIST AT IRVING TRUST CO CONTENDS THAT INTEREST RATES MAY DROP FURTHER BUT WILL LURCH BACK UP AGAIN LATER THIS YEAR
c28c021d HE SAYS YIELDS ON LONG TERM TREASURY ISSUES MAY DECLINE TO AS LOW AS EIGHT PERCENT BUT THEN YIELDS WILL START MOVING THE OTHER WAY
c28c021e WE'LL HIT TEN PERCENT A COUPLE OF TIMES AND WE'LL GO PAST IT LATER THIS YEAR
c28c021f THE SIXTY THREE YEAR OLD ADMIRAL IS PHILOSOPHICAL ABOUT HIS POSITION
c28c021g THE CHAIRMAN ISN'T IN COMMAND HE SAYS MATTER OF FACTLY
c28c021h I'M AN ADVISER
c28c021i INDEED THE J. C. S. CHIEF ISN'T IN THE CHAIN OF COMMAND WHICH PROCEEDS FROM THE PRESIDENT TO THE DEFENSE SECRETARY TO MAJOR COMMANDERS AROUND THE WORLD
c28c021j AND ALTHOUGH ADMIRAL CROWE BELIEVES THAT THE MILITARY REFORM LAW STRENGTHENS HIS HAND HE DOESN'T EXPECT IT TO TRANSFORM THE J. C. S. CHAIRMANSHIP QUICKLY
c28c021k IT'S TOUGH TO CHANGE ATTITUDES HE SAYS
c28c021l THIS MAY TURN OUT TO BE AN EXTREMELY POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE ALL OF THE TOBACCO MANUFACTURERS WERE INVOLVED IN THE ALLEGED CONSPIRACY MR. DAYNARD SAID
c28c021m THERE IS A LOT OF DAMNING EVIDENCE
c28c021n NOW THE JURY CAN CONSIDER ALMOST ALL THE EVIDENCE THAT CAME IN ABOUT DEFENDANTS' ATTEMPTS TO STONEWALL AND DENY
c28c021o BUT MR. EDELL HAS ARGUED THAT MRS. CIPOLLONE HEARD CONFLICTING MESSAGES ABOUT THE HAZARDS OF HER HABIT
c28c021p IN A DEPOSITION READ TO THE COURT IN APRIL MRS. CIPOLLONE SAID SHE WAS INITIALLY ATTRACTED TO SMOKING BECAUSE OF ITS SEDUCTIVE CONNOTATIONS OF HOLLYWOOD AND GLAMOUR
c28c021q THE CIGARETTE MAKERS' ADVERTISEMENTS REINFORCED THESE PERCEPTIONS AND OTHERS OF THE PRODUCT'S SAFETY THE PLAINTIFF CONTENDS
c28c021r BUT MR. CONABLE'S OWN NATURE STILL ISN'T CLEAR REPRESENTATIVE LAFALCE ARGUES
c28c021s BARBER CONABLE IS AN OUTSTANDING PERSON HE SAYS
c28c021t HE HAD A STRONG IDENTITY HERE IN CONGRESS WHICH HE EARNED
c28c021u BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE HIS OWN IDENTITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD BANK
c28c021v HE WAS CREATED BY JIM BAKER AND GEORGE BUSH IN THIS JOB
c28c021w HIS REPUTATION NOW RESTS ON HOW HE DEFINES HIMSELF
c28c021x THIS LACK OF UNDERSTANDING HAS INVESTORS LICKING THEIR CHOPS ON TWO FRONTS
c28c021y ONE CAMP THINKS THAT THE STOCK HAS REMAINED UNDERVALUED AS INVESTORS GRAPPLE TO COMPREHEND THE BUSINESSES
c28c021z ANOTHER CAMP HOPES FOR A TAKEOVER OR LEVERAGED BUY OUT THOUGH THE ERIE PENNSYLVANIA COMPANY SAYS IT DOESN'T KNOW OF ANY SUCH THING IN THE WORKS
c28c0221 THE PROPOSALS DON'T AMOUNT TO AN ASSAULT ON THE CURRENT TAX STRUCTURE CONTENDS BUSH SPOKESMAN STEPHEN HART
c28c0222 THEY ARE LASER LIKE OPENINGS IN THE TAX STRUCTURE FOR SPECIFIC REASONS HE SAYS
c28c0223 ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN FACTORED INTO HIS FLEXIBLE FREEZE OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING
c28c0224 HE ISN'T GOING TO RAISE TAXES PERIOD
c28c0225 THE SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN ENTITLES HOLDERS TO BUY STOCK IN THE SURVIVING COMPANY AT HALF PRICE IN THE EVENT OF A HOSTILE TAKEOVER
c28c0226 G. AND W. SAID IT ISN'T AWARE OF ANY EFFORT TO ACQUIRE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY
c28c0227 THE DISTRIBUTION IS PAYABLE SEPTEMBER NINETEENTH TO STOCK OF RECORD THAT DATE
c28c0228 THE RIGHTS EXPIRE SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT UNLESS REDEEMED EARLIER
c28c0229 I'D NEVER OWNED A SHARE NEVER EVEN KNEW WHAT A DIVIDEND OR THE STOCK EXCHANGE IS HE SAYS
c28c022a NOW I FOLLOW PRICES EVERY DAY IN THE PAPER
c28c022b WHEN I COMPARE WHAT I HAVE TO WHAT I HAD IN NINETEEN SEVENTY I HAVE NO DOUBT I WILL VOTE YES HE SAYS
c28c022c OVERALL CONSUMER SPENDING HAS SLOWED SINCE LAST YEAR'S STOCK MARKET CRASH BUT IT'S STILL AT A LEVEL THAT WORRIES SOME ECONOMISTS
c28c022d CONSUMER CREDIT SLOWED SHARPLY IN JULY REFLECTING SLUGGISH SALES
c28c022e TOO MUCH SPENDING AT HOME COUPLED WITH HEAVY DEMAND FOR EXPORTS COULD OVERLOAD AN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THAT IS ALREADY RUNNING NEAR CAPACITY
c28c022f NOW HIS LAUGHTER IS GONE
c28c022g BECAUSE OF DRUGS HE IS DEAD
c28c022h AND EVERY DAY MY HEART BREAKS A LITTLE MORE
c29c0201 EVEN WHEN COMPLAINTS ARE FILED THEY CAN BE DIFFICULT TO VERIFY
c29c0202 AGENCIES GENERALLY DON'T USE UNDERCOVER TESTERS POSING AS PROSPECTIVE TENANTS AS THEY DO IN RACE DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS THEY FEAR THAT THE TESTER COULD BE ATTACKED
c29c0203 INSTEAD THEY TRY TO BUILD CASES ON THE TESTIMONY OF CURRENT AND FORMER TENANTS
c29c0204 STOCK EXCHANGES COMMODITY MARKETS MANY BANKS AND SOME BUSINESSES WILL BE CLOSED IN THE U. S. MONDAY IN OBSERVANCE OF WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY
c29c0205 FEDERAL OFFICES WILL BE CLOSED AND THERE WON'T BE ANY REGULAR MAIL DELIVERIES
c29c0206 MANY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICES ALSO WILL BE CLOSED
c29c0207 THAT SORT OF HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION HAS LEGAL EXPERTS INVESTMENT BANKERS AND STOCK MARKET INVESTORS TIED UP IN KNOTS THESE DAYS
c29c0208 NICHOLAS BRADY CHAIRMAN OF DILLON READ AND COMPANY SAID IN SENATE TESTIMONY LAST MONTH THAT HE IS CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT IS PERMISSIBLE AND WHAT ISN'T
c29c0209 THERE NEEDS TO BE CLARIFICATION OF EXACTLY WHAT CONDUCT IS TO BE PROHIBITED BY THE CONCEPT OF INSIDER TRADING SAID MR. BRADY
c29c020a PUBLISHING SO CALLED BACKLIST BOOKS THAT ARE KEPT IN PRINT FOR YEARS ON END HAS SOME ADVANTAGES OVER PUBLISHING BEST SELLERS
c29c020b A GOOD FISHING BOOK WILL NEVER MATCH A JACKIE COLLINS NOVEL IN TOTAL SALES
c29c020c BUT IT WILL OUTLIVE HER RACY FICTION WITH ITS FICKLE READERS
c29c020d PUBLISHERS WILL DUMP MOST OF THIS YEAR'S BEST SELLERS ON REMAINDER TABLES NEXT YEAR WHERE THEY MAY FETCH AS LITTLE AS ONE DOLLAR APIECE
c29c020e IN A UNANIMOUS RULING THE JUSTICES UPHELD A FEDERAL LAW ALLOWING RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS ENGAGED IN NONPROFIT ACTIVITIES TO LIMIT HIRING TO PEOPLE OF THEIR OWN FAITH
c29c020f THE COURT RULED THAT THE CONSTITUTION ISN'T VIOLATED BY EXEMPTING SUCH GROUPS FROM THE FEDERAL LAW THAT BARS BIAS IN EMPLOYMENT BASED ON RELIGION
c29c020g THE DECISION GIVES RELIGIOUS GROUPS THE FLEXIBILITY TO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN HIRING CRITERIA
c29c020h THE COMPANY SAID IT HAS IDENTIFIED SEVENTY TWO VEHICLES DAMAGED DURING TESTING
c29c020i THIRTY TWO OF THOSE WERE SCRAPPED OR SOLD AS USED
c29c020j BUT FORTY WERE REPAIRED AND SOLD AS NEW EVEN THOUGH REPAIRS IN ONE CASE TOTALED NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS
c29c020k THESE VEHICLES WILL BE REPLACED WITH NEW CHRYSLER MODELS
c29c020l THE COMPANY SAID IT IS NOTIFYING DEALERS AND OWNERS PARTLY THROUGH A BIG ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN IT PLANS TO KICK OFF TODAY
c29c020m WHAT I AM SUGGESTING GENTLEMEN IS THAT THE PROCESS HAS NOT WORKED
c29c020n IT HAS BEEN INDISCREET ON BOTH ENDS OF PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE
c29c020o IF I HAD DIVULGED WHAT I WAS DOING MANY MANY LIVES WERE AT STAKE
c29c020p YESTERDAY THE AGENCY REVERSED THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR FINDING THAT MEREDITH HAD VIOLATED THE DOCTRINE
c29c020q THE SO CALLED FAIRNESS DOCTRINE IS A MISNOMER SAID DIANE KILLORY THE AGENCY'S GENERAL COUNSEL
c29c020r IT PROMOTES BLANDNESS AND NOTHINGNESS BY CHILLING THE VERY SPEECH IT WAS MEANT TO FOSTER
c29c020s SENATOR EXON HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST OUTSPOKEN PROPONENTS OF BLOCKING CERTAIN FOREIGN INVESTMENT
c29c020t WHEN FUJITSU ANNOUNCED ITS PLANS TO TAKE OVER FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION LAST YEAR HE WAS QUICK TO COMPLAIN
c29c020u FAIRCHILD ACCOUNTS FOR ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF U. S. SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTION AND WAS ALREADY CONTROLLED BY SCHLUMBERGER CORPORATION A LARGELY FRENCH OWNED FIRM
c29c020v NEVERTHELESS SENATOR EXON SAID THAT THE MERGER WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY
c29c020w NEVERTHELESS FIRST OPTIONS STILL LETS CUSTOMERS SUCH AS JAMES F. HART TRADE IN NAKED OUT OF THE MONEY PUTS AND CALLS
c29c020x MR. HART SAYS FIRST OPTIONS HASN'T SOUGHT TO REIN HIM IN
c29c020y OTHER BROKERAGE FIRMS HOWEVER HAVE CURBED OR HALTED UNHEDGED OPTIONS TRADING SINCE THE CRASH
c29c020z THE SITUATION APPEARS TO PUT THE BOARD IN A TOUGH SPOT
c29c0210 IT WAS NEVER ABLE TO COME UP WITH A FAIRNESS OPINION ON THE ORIGINAL OFFER
c29c0211 IT SAID IT COULDN'T RECOMMEND WHETHER THE COMPANY SHOULD BE SOLD AT THAT TIME OR AT WHAT PRICE
c29c0212 YESTERDAY CHARTER SAID ITS SPECIAL BOARD COMMITTEE HAD INFORMED THE GROUP THAT IT HASN'T DETERMINED WHETHER IT IS APPROPRIATE TO SELL THE COMPANY NOW EITHER
c29c0213 THE REVISED OFFER IS SUBJECT TO THE COMMITTEE'S DETERMINING THAT THE PRICE IS FAIR AMONG OTHER CONDITIONS
c29c0214 WE SAW IT WITH OIL AND WE'RE SEEING IT WITH GOLD SAYS JOHN DESSAUER AN ORLEANS MASSACHUSETTS MONEY MANAGER
c29c0215 WHEN THE PRICE GETS HIGH ENOUGH ALL THESE NEW RESERVES OPEN UP EVENTUALLY KNOCKING DOWN PRICES HE SAYS
c29c0216 HE ADDS THAT HE EXPECTS GOLD WILL SOON RETREAT TO BELOW FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS
c29c0217 THE OTHER EUROPEAN MARKETS ALSO POSTED DECLINES
c29c0218 STOCKS CLOSED LOWER IN PARIS ZURICH BRUSSELS AMSTERDAM STOCKHOLM AND MILAN
c29c0219 JOINING THE CROWD WERE SHARE PRICES IN SYDNEY WELLINGTON TAIPEI MANILA HONG KONG AND SINGAPORE
c29c021a ADVANCING ISSUES AND DECLINERS WERE NECK AND NECK YESTERDAY BUT THE HEAVIEST TRADING WAS AMONG THE ISSUES WITH RISING PRICES
c29c021b SOME FIFTY POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS AT ADVANCING PRICES COMPARED WITH THIRTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION THAT TRADED AT LOWER PRICES
c29c021c IN ALL A MODERATE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION SHARES TRADED ON NASDAQ YESTERDAY
c29c021d JIM POYNER AN ANALYST WITH RAUSCHER PIERCE REFSNES INCORPORATED IN DALLAS SAID THEY THE GROUP MAY RUN INTO SOME RESISTANCE FROM OUTSIDE SHAREHOLDERS
c29c021e THE COMPANY IS WORTH AT LEAST A FEW DOLLARS PER SHARE MORE THAN THIS
c29c021f I THINK IF ANOTHER COMPANY WERE TRYING TO BUY STERLING THEY'D HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN THIS
c29c021g AMERICAN STANDARD SAID IT IS VERY PLEASED BY BLACK AND DECKER'S WITHDRAWAL
c29c021h IT DECLINED TO ELABORATE
c29c021i IF BLACK AND DECKER SHOULD RESUME ITS PURSUIT SOURCES CLOSE TO AMERICAN STANDARD SAID THE COMPANY IS PREPARED TO RESIST AGAIN
c29c021j WHILE CAMPBELL IS CONFIDENT ITS MICROWAVE BREAKTHROUGH WILL LURE NEW CONSUMERS WHO HAVE NEVER BEFORE SAMPLED A FROZEN BREAKFAST OTHER COMPETITORS ARE WAFFLING
c29c021k WE HAVE LOOKED AT THEM MICROWAVE WAFFLES SAID A SPOKESMAN AT I. C. INDUSTRIES
c29c021l BUT OUR FEELING IS THAT THE TOASTER WAFFLES THAT YOU CAN PRODUCE IN THIRTY SECONDS ARE MORE CONVENIENT AND BETTER QUALITY
c29c021m BUT AT ANOTHER OPERATION IN RURAL NORTHERN ILLINOIS THERE ARE HARDLY ANY MINORITIES TO DRAW FROM
c29c021n WE PICKED THAT LOCATION BECAUSE WE NEEDED THE RIVER ACCESS THERE TO BE SUCCESSFUL MR. THOMPSON SAYS
c29c021o I KNOW I HAVE A SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
c29c021p BUT I ALSO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MY SHAREHOLDERS
c29c021q THE LAST STUMBLING BLOCK FOR THE BILL WAS SENATOR BRADLEY'S EFFORT TO ADD THE HOME CARE PROVISION
c29c021r AT FIRST SECRETARY BOWEN OPPOSED THE PROVISION BUT LAWMAKERS NARROWED THE BENEFIT AND LIMITED ITS COST
c29c021s THESE EFFORTS WON OVER THE REAGAN OFFICIAL WHO HAS CHAMPIONED THE LEGISLATION
c29c021t BOTH STAPLES AND OFFICE CLUB HOPE TO BE ABLE TO GO PUBLIC NEXT YEAR
c29c021u THEY AREN'T AFRAID OF LARGE DISCOUNTERS SUCH AS K. MART AND AMES
c29c021v MR. PEARLMAN THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER SAYS HISTORY HASN'T SHOWN THAT BIG RETAILERS HAVE BEEN GOOD AT SPECIALTY RETAILING
c29c021w MR. VIET HAS BIGGER WORRIES
c29c021x APART FROM UNCOOPERATIVE TARGETS THE PAPER AND ITS THIRTY TWO JOURNALISTS FACE A CHALLENGE TO BECOME MORE PROFESSIONAL HE SAYS
c29c021y CRITICIZING SHORTCOMINGS ISN'T ENOUGH
c29c021z WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE ACHIEVEMENTS
c29c0220 WE HAVE TO DEVELOP JUDGMENT AND THAT ISN'T EASY
c29c0221 IF THE SETTLEMENT IS COMPLETED THE COMPANY WOULD JOIN SHAREHOLDER PLAINTIFFS IN SEEKING DAMAGES AGAINST FOUNDER EDDIE ANTAR AND OTHERS
c29c0222 CRAZY EDDIE CURRENTLY IS A DEFENDANT IN THE HOLDERS' LITIGATION
c29c0223 THE NEW MANAGEMENT HAS ACCUSED MR. ANTAR IN COURT AND REGULATORY FILINGS OF ENGAGING IN A POSSIBLE SCHEME TO FALSIFY INVENTORY AND PROFIT REPORTS
c29c0224 INDEED NO CHANGES ARE LIKELY SOON BECAUSE THE WHOLESALERS AND SMALL RETAILERS THAT BENEFIT FROM THE EXISTING SYSTEM ARE WELL ORGANIZED BACKERS OF THE RULING LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY
c29c0225 THE JAPANESE DEBATE ON THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM BEGAN ONLY RECENTLY
c29c0226 EVEN AFTER A CONSENSUS IS REACHED NEW LEGISLATION MAY HAVE TO BE DRAFTED AND ENACTED
c29c0227 SHE SAID THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE NEW MODEL TO EXPAND THE MARKET RATHER THAN CANNIBALIZE SALES OF CONVENTIONAL MODELS
c29c0228 THE SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO CALIFORNIA COMPANY DECLINED TO PROJECT SALES FOR THE NEW MODEL
c29c0229 IN AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING YESTERDAY DIASONICS SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT TWO POINT EIGHT SEVEN FIVE DOLLARS
c29c022a IN BETWEEN THE PURCHASERS' REPORT AND THE JOBS DATA THE GOVERNMENT WILL RELEASE A HALF DOZEN OTHER SERIES INCLUDING JUNE'S LEADING ECONOMIC INDICATORS INDEX
c29c022b THAT INDEX COULD ADD TO RECESSION FEARS IF IT DECLINES AS EXPECTED
c29c022c A DROP IN THE GOVERNMENT'S CHIEF ECONOMIC FORECASTING TOOL WOULD MARK THE FOURTH DECLINE IN FIVE MONTHS
c29c022d A RULE OF THUMB AMONG ECONOMISTS HOLDS THAT THREE SUCCESSIVE DECLINES IN THE INDEX SIGNAL RECESSION
c29c022e WE ARE EXTREMELY SELECTIVE SAID PAUL SUCKOW DIRECTOR OF FIXED INCOME AT OPPENHEIMER MANAGEMENT CORPORATION
c29c022f I DON'T THINK SOME ISSUES ARE GOING TO MAKE IT HE SAID
c29c022g EVEN CAUTIOUS MANAGERS SUCH AS MR. SUCKOW ARE SEEING THE IMPACT OF THE CAMPEAU DEBACLE
c29c022h HE SAID HIS FIRM OWNS A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE FEDERATED SENIOR DEBT
c29c022i ALTHOUGH THE BONDS ARE SECURED BY BANK CREDITS THEY HAVE ALSO FALLEN IN PRICE RECENTLY
c2ac0201 A SPOKESWOMAN FOR C. B. S. SAID THERE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES AND WE'RE TRYING OUR BEST TO FIND SOLUTIONS WHILE OPERATING IN A VERY DEMANDING ECONOMIC CLIMATE
c2ac0202 WE'RE CONTINUING TO BARGAIN
c2ac0203 CAPITAL CITIES SLASH A. B. C. DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE TALKS
c2ac0204 DIVERSIFIED ENERGIES INCORPORATED COMPLETED THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF SENIOR NOTES
c2ac0207 THE PLACEMENT WAS MANAGED BY KIDDER PEABODY AND COMPANY
c2ac0208 BUT MR. MORRIS INDICATED THAT THE NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S INTERESTS APPEARED TO BE ELSEWHERE
c2ac0209 AFTER REFINANCING IS COMPLETE IMPROVING THE MARKETING OPERATIONS AT FLYING TIGER IS THE FOCAL POINT OF HIS STRATEGY AT THIS POINT MR. MORRIS SAID
c2ac020a TAX CREDITS ALSO WOULD BE USABLE IF THE AIRLINE WERE TO TURN A LARGE PROFIT HE NOTED
c2ac020b THE FOLLOWING LETTER HAS BEEN SIGNED BY ONE THOUSAND CHINESE CITIZENS WHO ARE STUDYING IN THE U. S.
c2ac020c MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY HAVE ALLOWED THEIR NAMES TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE U. S. CHINESE LANGUAGE PRESS THE REST HAVE REQUESTED ANONYMITY
c2ac020d A COPY OF THE DOCUMENT HAS BEEN DELIVERED TO THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
c2ac020e LAST OCTOBER SIX HUNDRED OF ITS ONE THOUSAND WORKERS WENT ON STRIKE AFTER THEIR CONTRACT EXPIRED
c2ac020f THE PLANTS CONTINUED TO OPERATE AT REDUCED CAPACITY DURING THE STRIKE AND A SPOKESMAN FOR THE COMPANY SAID ALL WORKERS ARE EXPECTED TO RETURN WITHIN A WEEK
c2ac020g DETAILS OF THE AGREEMENT WEREN'T DISCLOSED BUT THE SPOKESMAN SAID IT OFFERED MODEST WAGE INCREASES
c2ac020h BUYING CORPORATE ZEROS FOR AN I. R. A. NEUTRALIZES THEIR MOST OBVIOUS DISADVANTAGE THE TAX TREATMENT
c2ac020i WITH RARE EXCEPTIONS SUCH BONDS TRIGGER PERSONAL INCOME TAX EACH YEAR ON THE THEORETICAL ACCUMULATION OR ACCRETION OF INTEREST
c2ac020j THAT MEANS INVESTORS PAY TAX ON MONEY THEY HAVEN'T YET RECEIVED
c2ac020k <NOISE> IF THE BONDS ARE BOUGHT FOR AN I. R. A. HOWEVER NO TAX IS DUE UNTIL THE MONEY IS WITHDRAWN
c2ac020l THAT MAY SIGNAL THAT EQUITY LINKED EUROBONDS AREN'T GOING TO DISAPPEAR EVEN IF EQUITIES FALL OUT OF INVESTOR FAVOR
c2ac020n WE'LL JUST ADAPT THE PRODUCT
c2ac020o IT WAS A WONDERFUL DAY FOR THE BOND MARKETS SAID MICHAEL J. CONNERY THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF FINANCIAL FUTURES AT CHICAGO BASED REFCO INCORPORATED
c2ac020p ALL THE APPARENT SIGNS OF INFLATION WERE DEFLATED
c2ac020q AND THAT'S LED TO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SHORT COVERING OR TRADERS AND INVESTORS BUYING BACK SECURITIES THAT THEY BORROWED AND SOLD
c2ac020r WHATEVER WE THINK ABOUT THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT IN IRAN IT IS AMONG THE PLANET'S MOST VITAL TERRITORIES
c2ac020s OUR SHARED ENEMY HAS FIVE DIVISIONS IN IRAN'S NORTHERN BORDER
c2ac020t THIS LOOMING SOVIET PRESENCE THREATENS NOT JUST AFGHANISTAN SOUTH OF THE SOVIET UNION AND EAST OF IRAN BUT THE PERSIAN GULF
c2ac020u THE WARM WATER PORT THE CZARS DREAMED OF IS WITHIN REACH
c2ac020v WE WILL HAVE A LOT MORE THAN KUWAITI TANKERS TO WORRY ABOUT IF THE SOVIETS GET THEIR PAWS ON THE OIL SPIGOT OF WESTERN EUROPE AND JAPAN
c2ac020w IN SHORT THE FALL OF IRAN TO THE AYATOLLAH WAS BAD NEWS FOR THE WEST THE FALL OF IRAN TO THE SOVIETS WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE
c2ac020x AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THE INVESTIGATION OF MATTHEWS AND WRIGHT HAS LED TO AN UNPRECEDENTED EXAMINATION OF THE LARGELY UNREGULATED SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY BILLION DOLLAR MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET
c2ac020y THIS IN TURN HAS LED TO CALLS FROM FINANCIERS AND POLITICIANS FOR CLOSER REGULATION OF THIS HUGE MARKET
c2ac020z THE INVESTIGATION CENTERS ON WHETHER BOND ISSUES SOLD AS TAX EXEMPT BY MATTHEWS AND WRIGHT AND OTHER UNDERWRITERS ACTUALLY WARRANT TAX EXEMPT STATUS
c2ac0210 INVESTORS RANGING FROM U. S. CORPORATIONS TO JAPANESE BUYERS OF U. S. T. BILLS MUST FACTOR IN A RISK PREMIUM FOR DOLLAR VOLATILITY
c2ac0211 THUS IT IS AT LEAST PLAUSIBLE IF NOT LIKELY THAT DOLLAR VOLATILITY IS ONE REASON REAL INTEREST RATES HAVE STAYED HIGH IN THE U. S.
c2ac0212 IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT NO PLAN TO RESTORE STABILITY TO WORLD MARKETS CAN SUCCEED WITHOUT ADDRESSING DOLLAR VOLATILITY
c2ac0213 ANOTHER REASON MR. SOIFER IS AVOIDING MORGAN AND CITICORP IS THAT THEIR STOCK PRICES AT TIMES HAVE TENDED TO GYRATE MORE VIOLENTLY THAN OTHER BANK ISSUES
c2ac0214 CITICORP AND MORGAN TEND TO HAVE MORE VOLATILITY ON DAYS WHEN PROGRAM TRADING IS KNOWN TO OCCUR MR. SOIFER SAYS
c2ac0215 THEY'RE MORE OF A BET ON WHICH WAY THE MARKET IS HEADED
c2ac0216 INEVITABLY SOME WILL SEEK A FOURTH ALTERNATIVE TO CONTINUE BORROWING FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD MAKING ONLY MARGINAL ADJUSTMENTS IN OUR ECONOMIC POLICIES
c2ac0217 EARLIER THIS CENTURY THE BRITISH TAUGHT US THAT DEBT AND LEADERSHIP CANNOT LONG CO EXIST
c2ac0219 SOME MONTHS BEFORE THE CRASH INTEREST RATES STARTED TO MOVE UP
c2ac021a HOME MORTGAGE RATES WENT UP ALMOST TEN TIMES AS FAST AS THEY CAME DOWN
c2ac021b THE MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH WAS MUDDLING AT OR BELOW THE LOWER END OF THE TARGET RANGE A PHENOMENON WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED FOR MANY YEARS
c2ac021c CAMPEAU BOOSTED ITS HOSTILE OFFER FOR FEDERATED DEPARTMENT STORES TO FIVE POINT FOUR SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS AMID SIGNS OF A POSSIBLE BIDDING WAR FOR THE RETAILER
c2ac021d AT LEAST TWO MAJOR GROUPS ARE WEIGHING BIDS SOURCES SAID INCLUDING A GROUP LED BY KOHLBERG KRAVIS
c2ac021e OTHER POTENTIAL SUITORS ARE SAID TO BE DILLARD DEPARTMENT STORES AND THE DEVELOPERS ALFRED TAUBMAN AND MELVIN SIMON
c2ac021f PILLSBURY'S LOSS COMPARES WITH EARNINGS OF FORTY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OR FIFTY SIX CENTS A SHARE IN THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER
c2ac021g REVENUE FELL TWO PERCENT IN THE LATEST PERIOD TO ONE POINT FIVE OH BILLION DOLLARS FROM ONE POINT FIVE THREE BILLION DOLLARS
c2ac021h THE REVENUE DECLINE CAME FROM PILLSBURY'S RESTAURANT BUSINESS
c2ac021i AND THE AGREEMENT COMES AT A TIME WHEN THE NUMBER OF BEEF CATTLE IN THE NATION IS AT A TWENTY EIGHT YEAR LOW
c2ac021j CATTLEMEN HAVE BEEN CUTTING DOWN THEIR HERDS IN RESPONSE TO LOWER PRICES
c2ac021k WHILE PRICES BEGAN TO RISE THIS YEAR THE DROUGHT AND BANKERS' EAGERNESS TO HAVE FARM LOANS REPAID HAVE DELAYED ANY REBUILDING OF HERDS
c2ac021l I DON'T THINK ANY ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE JAPANESE AGREEMENT WILL AFFECT THAT A WHOLE LOT SAID JACK DAHL A LARGE NORTH DAKOTA RANCHER
c2ac021m STANFORD NOW CHOOSES NOT TO REQUIRE ITS UNDERGRADUATES TO STUDY THEIR WESTERN HERITAGE BUT THAT HISTORY DOES YIELD CERTAIN LESSONS
c2ac021n ONE OF THEM IS THAT MINORITIES THAT DO NOT RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO ATTACKS FROM THE MAJORITY MERELY ENCOURAGE FURTHER ASSAULTS
c2ac021o PERHAPS THE HOOVER OVERSEERS SHOULD KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN THEY PONDER THE LATEST AFFRONT TO GLENN CAMPBELL NEXT WEEK
c2ac021p SENATORIAL PRIVILEGE HAS SOLD MORE THAN SEVENTY THOUSAND COPIES DESPITE THIS MAJOR MEDIA NEGLECT OR PERHAPS BECAUSE OF IT
c2ac021q MR. DAMORE HAS GONE HAWKING THE BOOK IN THAT PARALLEL UNIVERSE OF POPULIST MEDIA OUTLETS
c2ac021r THE BOOK GOT ITS FIRST BIG PUSH FROM A SEGMENT ON A CURRENT AFFAIR THE FOX NETWORK'S TELEVISION TABLOID
c2ac021s MR. DAMORE HAS DONE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED INTERVIEWS ON TALK RADIO STATIONS
c2ac021t BANCORP HAWAII ALSO DECLARED A THREE FOR TWO STOCK SPLIT PAYABLE NOVEMBER SIXTEENTH TO STOCK OF RECORD OCTOBER TWENTY FOURTH
c2ac021u THE STOCK SPLIT WILL INCREASE THE COMPANY'S SHARES OUTSTANDING TO FOURTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION FROM NINE POINT SEVEN MILLION
c2ac021w INVESTORS ALSO PREFER REMICS BACKED BY SWAP TEN PERCENT SECURITIES BECAUSE PREPAYMENTS ARE LESS VOLATILE
c2ac021x FREDDIE MAC PASSES THROUGH ACTUAL PREPAYMENTS ON SWAP MORTGAGE ISSUES WHILE IT ESTIMATES PREPAYMENTS ON THE CASH ISSUES
c2ac021y PREPAYMENTS ON FREDDIE MAC CASH ISSUES ARE MUCH MORE VOLATILE FROM MONTH TO MONTH THAN PREPAYMENTS ON THE SWAP ISSUES
c2ac021z CHICAGO BASED J. M. B.'S FORTY NINE DOLLAR A SHARE BID FOR AMFAC HAS A TOTAL VALUE OF ABOUT NINE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS

c2ac0222 IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE AUCTIONS ARE GOING IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN TOKYO SAID MR. PETRI OF MERRILL LYNCH
c2ac0223 NO ONE FIRM CAN DOMINATE THE AUCTION PROCESS THE WAY SALOMON USED TO
c2ac0224 THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE JAPANESE INFLUENCE
c2ac0225 THE SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICE FOR CINDERELLA IS TWENTY SIX DOLLARS AND NINETY NINE CENTS AND FOR E. T. TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS AND NINETY FIVE CENTS
c2ac0226 BUT BOTH HAVE BEEN HEAVILY DISCOUNTED BY AS MUCH AS NINE DOLLARS A CASSETTE AND BOTH HAVE REBATE OFFERS
c2ac0227 THE HOME VIDEO INDUSTRY IS HOPING THE MASSIVE PURCHASES OF BOTH CASSETTES WILL TURN MANY CASSETTE RENTERS INTO AT LEAST OCCASIONAL BUYERS IN THE FUTURE
c2ac0228 DURING THAT CAMPAIGN AS IN EARLIER ONES A FEW LOW AND MIDDLE RANKING OFFICIALS WERE ARRESTED OR DISMISSED
c2ac0229 BUT NO LEADING CADRES OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS WERE PUNISHED FUELING CYNICISM AMONG THE MASSES
c2ac022b WE GIVE A LOOK LIKE A GENERATION BEFORE THEM LIVED HERE SAID MR. MARDER
c2ac022c THAT'S WORTH MONEY
c2ac022e SALES ARE STILL UNDER TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR HE SAYS BUT THEY'RE HEADED UP
c2ac022f THE SINHALESE COMMUNITY ALSO HAS BEEN DRIVEN TO SELF DEFENSE
c2ac022g CONTRARY TO A VIEW FASHIONABLE IN MANY CIRCLES OF THE COLOMBO ELITE THE J. V. P. HAS NOT CAUSED THE PRESENT INSURGENCY
c2ac022h NEITHER CAN IT EVEN BE SAID TO BE LEADING IT IT IS RACING TO KEEP UP WITH IT
c2bc0201 ALBERT HALPRIN CHIEF OF THE F. C. C.'S COMMON CARRIER BUREAU SAID HE HADN'T SEEN THE CONSUMER GROUP'S STUDY
c2bc0202 HE SAID PREVIOUS STUDIES BY THE GROUP HAD FOCUSED ON FLAT RATE SERVICE FOR LOCAL CALLS
c2bc0203 MR. HALPRIN CONCEDED THAT SUCH RATES HAD RISEN SHARPLY BUT HE ADDED THAT PHONE COMPANIES NOW OFFER A VARIETY OF LOCAL TELEPHONE PLANS AT DIFFERING PRICES
c2bc0204 THE DEPARTMENT EXPECTS A TWO PERCENT RISE IN THE MEDIAN VALUE OF INDUSTRY SHIPMENTS NEXT YEAR AFTER INFLATION ADJUSTMENT
c2bc0205 AMONG SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES THE DEPARTMENT EXPECTS HIGH TECHNOLOGY CONCERNS TO LEAD THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR
c2bc0206 SHIPMENTS FOR THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY ARE SEEN GROWING TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT
c2bc0207 OTHER FAST GROWING INDUSTRIES INCLUDE ELECTRONIC CAPACITORS OPTICAL DEVICES AND LENSES X. RAY EQUIPMENT AND MISSILES AND SPACE VEHICLES
c2bc0208 PAYOFFS TO MOSCOW BY THE WEST COULD RANGE FROM SOFTENING HUMAN RIGHTS POLICIES TO EXTENDING CHEAP LOANS TO RELAXING TECHNOLOGY CONTROLS
c2bc0209 THE AVAILABLE SOVIET INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE ITS NORTH SEA NAVY ITS MOBILE ARMORED FORCES IN CENTRAL EUROPE AND ITS ARRAY OF CONVENTIONALLY ARMED TACTICAL MISSILES
c2bc020a WHETHER SUCH BLACKMAIL WOULD EVER BE SENSIBLE OR POSSIBLE IS ARGUABLE BUT OFFICIALS LIKE MR. ABSHIRE DON'T WANT MOSCOW TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRY
c2bc020b I WAS STARTLED STARTLED ISN'T THE WORD REACTED ALVIN NOVICK A BIOLOGY PROFESSOR AT YALE UNIVERSITY
c2bc020c HE WARNED THAT FORCED TESTING SUCH AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE CENTERS WOULD DRIVE HOMOSEXUALS UNDERGROUND AND AWAY FROM COOPERATION WITH PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS
c2bc020d RATIONAL PEOPLE WON'T COOPERATE IN RUINING THEIR OWN LIVES HE SAID
c2bc020e IN THE FEBRUARY TWENTY SECOND ACCORD THE U. S. AND ITS ALLIES ASSERTED THAT THE DOLLAR HAD DECLINED ENOUGH
c2bc020f THEY PLEDGED TO INTERVENE JOINTLY IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS TO KEEP EXCHANGE RATES AT ABOUT THEIR CURRENT LEVELS
c2bc020g THE DOLLAR REMAINED STABLE FOR ABOUT FOUR WEEKS AFTER THE ACCORD WAS REACHED BUT THEN BEGAN TO SLUMP AGAINST THE JAPANESE YEN
c2bc020h CENTRAL BANKS INTERVENED AND EVENTUALLY HELPED ARREST THE SLIDE
c2bc020i MR. BOTHA ALSO MUST RULE ON THE FATE OF THE GROUP AREAS ACT
c2bc020j VIOLATIONS OF THE ACT ARE RAMPANT BUT THERE WERE ONLY FOUR PROSECUTIONS UNDER IT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX ONE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND NONE THE YEAR BEFORE
c2bc020k A RECENT POLL BY THE AFRIKAANS NEWSPAPER RAPPORT FOUND THAT ONLY TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF SURVEYED WHITES WANT THE ACT RETAINED
c2bc020l MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR PERCENT WANT IT SCRAPPED COMPLETELY WHILE ANOTHER THIRTY FOUR PERCENT WANT EACH LOCAL COMMUNITY OR PROPERTY OWNER TO DECIDE WHO CAN RENT OR BUY HOUSING
c2bc020m J. P.
c2bc020n MORGAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A HERO OF MINE MR. FARKAS SAYS
c2bc020o <NOISE> OF COURSE HE QUICKLY ADDS I DON'T SEE MYSELF AS A ROBBER BARON IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM
c2bc020p ON THE BIG BOARD VOLUME ROSE TO TWO HUNDRED TWENTY POINT FIVE MILLION SHARES FROM ONE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION THURSDAY
c2bc020q BUT THE ACTIVITY WAS LESS THAN ON PREVIOUS TRIPLE WITCHING DAYS AND MUCH OF THE TRADING WAS PACKED INTO THE OPENING AND CLOSING MINUTES OF THE SESSION
c2bc020r MORE THAN THIRTY ONE MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS IN THE FINAL MINUTE
c2bc020s THE IRAN CONTRA PANEL'S BIG SCENE GOT OFF WITH A BANG YESTERDAY
c2bc020t LIEUTENANT COLONEL OLLIE NORTH WAS SWORN IN AND BRENDAN SULLIVAN JUNIOR HIS LAWYER PROMPTLY SET OUT TO PROVE THAT WITNESSES CAN TALK BACK AT A CONGRESSIONAL HEARING
c2bc020u HE ACCUSED THE COMMITTEE OF WORKING HAND IN GLOVE WITH THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR THREATENING TO INDICT HIS CLIENT AND USING DIRTY TRICKS BESIDES
c2bc020v MR. CAO HASN'T LOOKED BACK
c2bc020w HE MAKES TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A YEAR PRODUCING HIS BUG ART ABOUT EIGHT TIMES THE AVERAGE CHINESE INCOME
c2bc020x AND HIS SUCCESS HAS SPAWNED IMITATORS SOME OF WHOM ARE NOW ALSO SELLING THEIR WARES THROUGH THE FRIENDSHIP STORE
c2bc020y IN TAMPA A JIM WALTER SPOKESMAN WOULDN'T DISCUSS THE MATTER
c2bc020z PEOPLE CAN SAY WHAT THEY WANT BUT WE DON'T COMMENT HE SAID
c2bc0210 MR. WALTER HIMSELF AND OTHER TOP EXECUTIVES DIDN'T RETURN PHONE CALLS
c2bc0211 HE ALSO RELIED HEAVILY ON ADVERTISING RATHER THAN ON DIRECT MAILING WHICH IS BY FAR THE MOST COMMON WAY FOR NEWSLETTER PUBLISHERS TO SOLICIT SUBSCRIBERS
c2bc0212 THIS UNUSUAL STRATEGY EVOLVED FROM A SMALL AD PLACED IN A BUSINESS MAGAZINE
c2bc0213 THE NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR AD GENERATED ENOUGH SUBSCRIPTIONS TO PAY FOR ITSELF IN A WEEK SO MR. KOBREN BEGAN ADVERTISING IN OTHER PUBLICATIONS
c2bc0214 OF HIS COMPANY'S ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN OPERATING EXPENSES LAST YEAR FULLY HALF WENT FOR MARKETING
c2bc0215 UNDER THE PLAN THE EDELMAN GROUP WOULD CONTRIBUTE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN EQUITY TO THE TRANSACTION
c2bc0216 THE REMAINDER WOULD BE FINANCED WITH DEBT AND DEBT SECURITIES
c2bc0217 IF THE PLAN SUCCEEDS SHEARSON WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE WARRANTS TO BUY TEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT OF THE FULLY DILUTED COMMON EQUITY OF THE COMPANY
c2bc0218 THE HUGE GAP TO A LARGE EXTENT IS A PRICE PHENOMENON
c2bc0219 THE DOLLAR'S FALL HAS PUSHED UP THE PRICE OF IMPORTS CAUSING THE DEFICIT TO SWELL EVEN AS THE VOLUME OF NON OIL IMPORTS HAS RECEDED
c2bc021a BUT LONG BEFORE NOW THESE HIGHER PRICES WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT IN THE MONTHLY MERCHANDISE TRADE DEFICIT AS WELL
c2bc021b IN INTERVIEWS AND SPEECHES MR. ROH HAS SHOWN A GOOD GRASP OF THE ISSUES KOREA'S NEXT PRESIDENT FACES
c2bc021c HE TAKES NORTH KOREA FOR THE SERIOUS THREAT THAT IT IS
c2bc021d NATIONAL SECURITY IS A BIG CONCERN FOR SOUTH KOREANS AND IF THEY THINK MR. ROH CAN BEST PROVIDE IT THAT'S A PERFECTLY GOOD REASON TO VOTE FOR HIM
c2bc021e MR. ROH ALSO FAVORS A FREER ECONOMY TO KEEP SOUTH KOREAN DEVELOPMENT ROLLING
c2bc021f IN DECEMBER AUTO LOANS INCREASED BY TWO POINT FIVE TWO BILLION DOLLARS OR AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF ELEVEN POINT SEVEN PERCENT
c2bc021g CREDIT CARD BORROWING SOARED BY TWO POINT THREE TWO BILLION DOLLARS OR AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF NINETEEN POINT FOUR PERCENT
c2bc021h A FED ECONOMIST SUGGESTED THIS LARGE INCREASE MAY REFLECT SLOWER GROWTH EARLIER IN THE YEAR AS CONSUMERS USED HOME EQUITY LOANS TO PAY OFF CREDIT CARD BALANCES
c2bc021i ALL THE INCREASES ARE SEASONALLY ADJUSTED
c2bc021j THE ORDER CARRIED OUT THE SHIP TAKES OFF AT FLANK SPEED FROM THE BARENTS HEADED SOUTH TO AVOID DETECTION
c2bc021k THEN INEXPLICABLY A FEW HOURS LATER ALL COMMUNICATION VANISHES
c2bc021l NONE WITH WASHINGTON NONE WITH OTHER SHIPS NO SIGNALS FROM THE USUAL COMMERCIAL STATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD
c2bc021m FOR AUTHORS AND PUBLISHERS A NEW COMPETITOR IN THE BOOK CLUB FIELD IS A GODSEND
c2bc021n BOOK CLUB RIGHTS ARE SECOND ONLY TO PAPERBACK RIGHTS IN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL REVENUE FOR PUBLISHERS
c2bc021o FURTHERMORE A BOOK CLUB IMPRIMATUR ON A BOOK GIVES IT ENORMOUS CACHET WITH BOOKSTORE MANAGERS
c2bc021p AGE DISCRIMINATION IS OFTEN THE BASIS FOR LEGAL ACTION BY AN EMPLOYEE AGAINST HIS FORMER COMPANY
c2bc021q WHEN A MAJOR NATIONAL RETAILER WENT THROUGH A COST CUTTING PERIOD A NUMBER OF OLDER EXECUTIVES WERE DISCHARGED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE CONSOLIDATION OF DEPARTMENTS
c2bc021r THESE EXECUTIVES BANDED TOGETHER AND INSTITUTED A CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST THE FORMER EMPLOYER
c2bc021s A VERY SIMILAR CASE OCCURRED WITH ANOTHER NATIONAL RETAILER THAT SOUGHT TO REDUCE ITS OVERHEAD AND OPERATING EXPENSES
c2bc021t ANOTHER LARGE CLASS ACTION SUIT ALSO BASED ON THE CHARGE OF AGE DISCRIMINATION IS PENDING AGAINST A LEADING MIDWESTERN BANK
c2bc021u WOMEN ON THE JOB LONG FOR THE FAMILY DINNER A SURVEY OF FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY CAREER WOMEN BY THE MAGAZINE WORKING WOMAN SHOWS
c2bc021v WHILE SIXTY ONE PERCENT BUY FANCY TAKEOUT FOODS HALF FEEL GUILTY THAT THEY DON'T COOK AND SERVE HOME MEALS TO THEIR FAMILIES
c2bc021w FULLY EIGHTY ONE PERCENT OF THOSE WITH PRE ADOLESCENT CHILDREN TRY TO RE CREATE THE DINNER TABLE OF THEIR OWN YOUTH
c2bc021x BUT MR. PARCHER IS ALSO CONSIDERED ABRASIVE AT TIMES
c2bc021y HE RUBS SOME PEOPLE WRONG SAYS LEONARD MARKS WHO HAS TRIED CASES AGAINST HIM
c2bc021z HE'S VERY OUTSPOKEN
c2bc0220 IN THE NEW CONSUMERIST CHILE THIS IS A MAN WHO DOESN'T EVEN OWN A CAR
c2bc0221 THE SON OF A RETIRED AIR FORCE OFFICER HE LIVES QUIETLY WITH HIS WIFE AND TWO DAUGHTERS IN A SMALL HOUSE IN SANTIAGO
c2bc0222 HE PREFERS THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN TO THE WEEKLY NEWS MAGAZINES
c2bc0223 HIS TRAINING WAS AS A MINING ENGINEER NOT AS AN ECONOMIST
c2bc0224 AMONG HIS RECENT READING THE EYE OF THE FLY
c2bc0225 THE INDICTMENTS ALLEGE THAT MESSRS.
c2bc0226 MARTINO AND ORLOFF APPROVED MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR WORK DONE LARGELY BY HANLEY WORLDWIDE
c2bc0227 THEY RECEIVED PAYMENTS IN CASH AND IN THE FORM OF CLOTHES CLUB MEMBERSHIP AND PAYMENT OF PERSONAL BILLS ACCORDING TO THE CHARGES
c2bc0228 DESPITE THE PROBLEMS WITH THE CLARIDGE MR. WYNN DIDN'T RULE OUT AN EVENTUAL RETURN TO THE ATLANTIC CITY GAMBLING SCENE
c2bc0229 IT'S DISAPPOINTING HE SAID OF THE FAILED PROPOSAL
c2bc022a BUT THIS IS A VERY LIVELY MARKET AND WE HAVEN'T GIVEN UP YET
c2bc022b NOW HIS LAUGHTER IS GONE
c2bc022c BECAUSE OF DRUGS HE IS DEAD
c2bc022d AND EVERY DAY MY HEART BREAKS A LITTLE MORE
c2bc022e A SPOKESWOMAN FOR ASHLAND SAID WE HAVE BEEN OUTRAGED BY THIS ENTIRE INCIDENT
c2bc022f COMPANY OFFICIALS NOTIFIED FEDERAL AUTHORITIES TWO YEARS AGO THAT THE IRANIANS HAD ACCESS TO THE DOCUMENTS AND REQUESTED AN INVESTIGATION
c2bc022g ASHLAND WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN OF MR. ATKINS'S INVOLVEMENT THE SPOKESWOMAN SAID
c2cc0201 HIS VEHICLE WILL BE METROMEDIA COMPANY THE GENERAL PARTNERSHIP THAT WAS FORMED IN NOVEMBER TO REPLACE THE LIQUIDATED METROMEDIA INCORPORATED WHICH MR. KLUGE OWNED MOST OF
c2cc0202 THE PARTNERSHIP IS SUBSTANTIALLY DOMINATED BY MR. KLUGE AND INCLUDES ONLY ONE OTHER PARTNER STUART SUBOTNICK MR. KLUGE'S LONGTIME ASSOCIATE
c2cc0203 THE TWO ARE NOW SCANNING THE WORLD FOR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES MR. KLUGE SAYS AND HOPE TO MAKE SOME NEW INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS BY NEXT YEAR
c2cc0204 DELTA IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE THAT IT WILL BECOME THE NEW OFFICIAL CARRIER FOR WALT DISNEY WORLD IN ORLANDO FLORIDA
c2cc0205 THE AIRLINE IS CALLING TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT THE MOST IMPORTANT MARKETING ENDEAVOR IN DELTA'S RECENT HISTORY
c2cc0206 FOR RIVAL EASTERN AIRLINES A UNIT OF TEXAS AIR CORPORATION IT MAY BE YET ANOTHER LOSS OF PRESTIGE
c2cc0207 HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
c2cc0208 TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
c2cc0209 THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
c2cc020a WITH THIS BROADENED INTEREST GOLD MAY NOW HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR MUCH GREATER LONG TERM PRICE APPRECIATION THAN HISTORICAL GUIDELINES SUGGEST SOME MARKET SPECIALISTS SAY
c2cc020b MR. NICHOLS COMPARES THE SITUATION TO A THEATER
c2cc020c IN NINETEEN EIGHTY HE SAYS ONLY THE FRONT ROW OF SEATS WAS OCCUPIED
c2cc020d NOW THE THEATER IS MORE THAN HALF FULL AND HE EXPECTS A LOT OF HUSTLE AND BUSTLE IF A GOLD BUYING SPREE DEVELOPS
c2cc020e I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT
c2cc020f HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY SERIOUS THOUGHT TO DIVERSIFYING
c2cc020g MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE A VARIETY OF HOLDINGS IN YOUR PORTFOLIO
c2cc020h OR PERHAPS YOU SHOULD LIMIT YOUR EXPOSURE BY HEDGING
c2cc020i YOU COULD MAKE A PLAY ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS DEAL I SUGGESTED EARNESTLY
c2cc020j THOUGH THERE ISN'T A CURE FOR AIDS PROPONENTS ARGUE THAT THOSE WHO TEST POSITIVE CAN BE OFFERED TREATMENTS TO PROLONG THEIR LIVES
c2cc020k FOR INSTANCE THEY CAN TAKE MEDICATION TO PREVENT CATCHING THE KIND OF PNEUMONIA THAT MOST COMMONLY LEADS TO THE DEATH OF AIDS SUFFERERS
c2cc020l AND THOSE WHO HAVE NOT YET DEVELOPED AIDS CAN TAKE STEPS TO GUARD AGAINST OTHER DISEASES SUCH AS HERPES AND HEPATITIS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO ACCELERATE ITS ONSET
c2cc020m WHILE THE U. S. FOCUSES ON THE IRAN CONTRA HEARINGS MORE SOVIET ARMS FLOW INTO NICARAGUA
c2cc020n MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF WEAPONS WERE DELIVERED TO THE SANDINISTAS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR ACCORDING TO U. S. INTELLIGENCE
c2cc020o THAT'S ABOUT NINE TIMES THE DIRECT U. S. MILITARY AID PROVIDED TO THE CONTRAS IN THAT PERIOD
c2cc020p THE SOVIET EQUIPMENT IS JUST POURING IN ONE RANKING PENTAGON OFFICIAL TOLD THE A. P.
c2cc020q THE NICARAGUANS ARE CONSOLIDATING THEIR MILITARY BUILDUP AND ADDING TO IT EVERYTHING IMAGINABLE
c2cc020r IN REACTION TO THE NEWS INTEREST RATES PLUNGED THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR FIRMED AND ANALYSTS PREDICTED STOCKS WOULD MOVE HIGHER
c2cc020s BUT WHILE THE BUDGET GAVE A BOOST TO THE MARKETS IT ALSO PRESAGED GREATER AUSTERITY FOR THE NATION AS A WHOLE
c2cc020t TO MR. HAWKE THAT IS AS IT SHOULD BE
c2cc020u AUSTRALIANS HAVE GOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE AREN'T OUT OF THE WOODS YET HE SAYS
c2cc020v WE'VE GOT ENORMOUS PROBLEMS AND WE HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE WITHIN OUR RESOURCES
c2cc020w LONDON'S FINANCIAL TIMES THIRTY SHARE INDEX ROSE THIRTEEN POINT FOUR TO ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX POINT NINE
c2cc020x THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX ROSE FIFTEEN POINT SEVEN TO TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE POINT FIVE
c2cc020y IT HAD BEEN UP AS MUCH AS TWENTY EIGHT POINT ONE IN LATE MORNING
c2cc020z THE GOLD MINES INDEX FELL FOUR POINT SIX TO FOUR HUNDRED FORTY FIVE POINT EIGHT
c2cc0210 VOLUME WAS SIX HUNDRED NINETY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES COMPARED WITH FIVE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION WEDNESDAY
c2cc0211 REPUBLICANS CANNOT EXPECT TO CHANGE BLACK VOTING PATTERNS OVERNIGHT ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE FILTER OF MYTH AND FALSE ACCUSATION THEY WILL HAVE TO SEND THEIR MESSAGE THROUGH
c2cc0212 BUT THEY CAN DO MUCH BETTER THAN THEY'VE DONE IF THEY'RE WILLING TO MAKE THE EFFORT CLARENCE THOMAS AND OTHER BLACK REPUBLICANS DESCRIBE
c2cc0213 A GOOD PLACE TO START IS THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT CAMPAIGN
c2cc0214 IN NEW YORK THE MARKET ROUT HAS PUT SELLERS UNDER MORE PRESSURE
c2cc0215 FOR EXAMPLE AN EXECUTIVE IN THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY RECENTLY TURNED DOWN A TWO MILLION DOLLAR OFFER ON HIS WEST SIDE COOPERATIVE APARTMENT AS BEING TOO LOW
c2cc0216 YESTERDAY HE HURRIEDLY CALLED HIS BROKER S. W. BIRD AND COMPANY TO SAY HE WOULD ACCEPT THE BID IF IT WAS STILL OFFERED
c2cc0217 BUT FOR MOST MUTUAL FUND INVESTORS THE TAX BITE THIS YEAR WILL BE BIGGER THAN EVER
c2cc0218 HOLDERS ARE TAXED ON ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS UNDER THE NEW TAX LAW FOR INSTANCE
c2cc0219 PREVIOUSLY SIXTY PERCENT WAS EXCLUDED FROM TAXATION
c2cc021a ANY GAIN CREDITED TO INVESTORS BY THEIR FUND IS CONSIDERED REALIZED WHETHER THE HOLDER ACTUALLY SELLS ANY FUND SHARES OR NOT
c2cc021b THE SUN BELT FORECAST PARTLY CLOUDY
c2cc021c ECONOMISTS EXPECT THE SOUTHEAST BUFFERED BY ITS BIG SERVICE ECONOMY TO CONTINUE TO OUTPERFORM THE NATION
c2cc021d BUT SOME OVERBUILT REAL ESTATE MARKETS COULD GET BASHED AND FLORIDA'S INFLUX OF RETIREES JOB SEEKERS AND TOURISTS COULD DWINDLE
c2cc021e CHRYSLER CORPORATION HAS EXTENDED HOLIDAYS AT FOUR PLANTS AND IN SOME CASES INDEFINITELY SLOWED PRODUCTION
c2cc021f A TOTAL OF TEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED WORKERS ARE AFFECTED
c2cc021g AND CHAIRMAN LEE A. IACOCCA SAYS CHRYSLER WILL ANNOUNCE A PERMANENT PLANT CLOSING EARLY THIS YEAR
c2cc021h SO FAR WE'VE FOUND THAT FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HAVE DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF SENSITIVITY AND COMMON SENSE MRS. HORNER SAID
c2cc021i BUT THERE IS A NEED FOR CLARITY
c2cc021j THESE GUIDELINES WILL SERVE AS REASSURANCE TO OUR MANAGERS
c2cc021k SOME WONDER WHETHER ALL THE CONVERSIONS DON'T MAKE MR. BEREGOVOY MORE OF AN OPPORTUNIST THAN A BELIEVER IN THE MARKET ECONOMY
c2cc021l BUT HIS AIDES SAY HE WAS CONVINCED THAT HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING
c2cc021m MR. BEREGOVOY SAID I'M NOT ASHAMED OF WHAT I DO
c2cc021n THE ONLY NEW ISSUE PRICED YESTERDAY WAS FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF TWELVE YEAR SENIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES FROM U. S. G. CORPORATION
c2cc021o THE HIGH RISK HIGH YIELD ISSUE WAS PRICED AT PAR TO YIELD THIRTEEN AND ONE QUARTER PERCENT BY SALOMON BROTHERS INCORPORATED AND GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY
c2cc021p THE OFFERING IS PART OF U. S. G.'S RECAPITALIZATION PLAN
c2cc021q THE SEEDS OF NATWEST'S INVESTMENT BANKING PROBLEMS WERE SOWN MONTHS BEFORE THE DEREGULATION OF BRITAIN'S FINANCIAL MARKETS
c2cc021r RIVALS SUCH AS BARCLAYS AND S. G. WARBURG GROUP P. L. C. ASSEMBLED POWERHOUSE CONGLOMERATES OF BROKERAGE TRADING AND FIXED INCOME SECURITIES FIRMS
c2cc021s BUT NATWEST THEN PUSHING TO DISLODGE BARCLAYS AS BRITAIN'S TOP COMMERCIAL BANK WAS MORE RELUCTANT TO COMMIT ITSELF TO A SIMILAR POSITION IN INVESTMENT BANKING
c2cc021t I HAVE NEVER SOUGHT EITHER WILLFULLY OR OTHERWISE TO EVADE INCOME TAX MR. SEOW SAID
c2cc021v HE REPEATED HIS VOW TO STAND FOR PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS EXPECTED LATER THIS YEAR
c2cc021w I JUST CHECKED THIS MORNING HE SAID
c2cc021x BIDS WERE DOWN A QUARTER TO HALF A POINT AND I'M TOLD THEY'RE NOW STARTING TO COME BACK
c2cc021y IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL
c2cc021z VOLUME IS NO DIFFERENT
c2cc0220 THE MARKET HASN'T CHANGED CHARACTER
c2cc0221 SO FAR FROM A MARKET VIEWPOINT IT DOESN'T LOOK TO BE MUCH OF AN EVENT
c2cc0222 AS A RESULT THE SEQUOIA WON'T BE GOING BACK TO THE U. S. NAVY THIS YEAR
c2cc0223 OR PERHAPS ANY YEAR
c2cc0224 AND THE SHIP WHICH WAS USED BY EIGHT U. S. PRESIDENTS MIGHT EVEN GO UNDER
c2cc0225 JACKSON DEMOCRATS SEE MR. JACKSON AS AN ACTIVIST STRONG LEADER WHO IS MORE WILLING TO TAKE RISKS THAN THOSE IN THE OFTEN BLANDER CONGRESSIONAL WING OF THE PARTY
c2cc0226 HE CLEARLY COMMANDS THE DEMOCRATS' MOST LOYAL CONSTITUENCY
c2cc0227 IT IS NEVER WISE TO IGNORE THOSE YOU CAN DEPEND ON SAYS SONIA JARVIS OF THE NATIONAL COALITION ON BLACK VOTER PARTICIPATION
c2cc0228 AND SAYS MR. WAGNER IT WORKS
c2cc0229 I'M OPTIMISTIC
c2cc022a IT'S GETTING BETTER FOR GAYS AND LESBIANS
c2cc022b IF YOU'D TOLD ME TEN YEARS AGO I'D BE CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TODAY I WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED YOU
c2cc022c ONE NEW DIRECTORATE MEMBER ISN'T LIKELY TO CHANGE BUNDESBANK POLICY
c2cc022d BUT BUNDESBANK WATCHERS EXPECT MR. TIETMEYER TO SIDE WITH MR. POEHL'S MONETARY POLICIES WHICH EMPHASIZE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION OVER UNILATERAL ACTIONS
c2cc022e OTHER COUNCIL MEMBERS HAVE FREQUENTLY CLASHED WITH MR. POEHL OVER HIS EFFORT TO COORDINATE WEST GERMAN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE MOVES WITH OTHER CENTRAL BANKS
c2dc0201 HIS VEHICLE WILL BE METROMEDIA COMPANY THE GENERAL PARTNERSHIP THAT WAS FORMED IN NOVEMBER TO REPLACE THE LIQUIDATED METROMEDIA INCORPORATED WHICH MR. KLUGE OWNED MOST OF
