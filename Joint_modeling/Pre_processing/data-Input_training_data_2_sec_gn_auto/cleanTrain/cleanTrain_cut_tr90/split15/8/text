c15c021y A VOTE FOR CONISTON PROBABLY MEANS A TAKEOVER OR RESTRUCTURING AND A QUICK PROFIT
c15c021z A GILLETTE VICTORY ALMOST CERTAINLY WOULD SEND THE COMPANY'S STOCK PLUNGING POSSIBLY TO AS LOW AS THIRTY DOLLARS ANALYSTS PREDICT
c15c0220 THE OFFER IS A BRILLIANT DEFENSE CONTRIVED BY SANTA FE'S INVESTMENT BANKERS AT SALOMON BROTHERS AND GOLDMAN SACHS
c15c0221 THE SIXTY THREE DOLLAR A SHARE PRICE WILL HANG OVER THE NEGOTIATIONS LIKE SMOG OVER LOS ANGELES
c15c0222 AND THOUGH MR. DINGMAN WILL OFFER PACKAGE AFTER PACKAGE THAT SEEMS TO ADD UP TO SIXTY THREE DOLLARS HE DOESN'T REALLY PLAN TO MEET THE ASKING PRICE
c15c0223 INSTEAD HE HOPES TO PERSUADE SANTA FE TO TAKE LESS

c15c0228 AS A START JAPAN REVISED ITS SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE LAW LAST MAY

c15c022c BANKS WOULD HAVE A NEW MARKET AT THE I. M. F. WHERE THEY COULD PEDDLE UNWANTED DEBTOR NATION PAPER
c15c022d THE DEBTOR NATIONS WOULD HAVE A NEW SOURCE OF FINANCING OF SORTS
c15c022e THEY COULD RESCHEDULE A PORTION OF THEIR DEBTS WITH A POSSIBILITY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OF REPAYING SOME IN THEIR OWN CURRENCIES
c15c022f THE I. M. F. WOULD HAVE A MORE CENTRAL ROLE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL DEBT

c16c0201 IN ADDITION TO THE WAR OF NERVES OVER DISCOUNTS RETAIL EXECUTIVES SAID THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY THE ABSENCE OF A BIG HIT IN THE TOY DEPARTMENT
c16c0202 BUT RETAILERS HAVE SEEN STRONG SALES OF BIG TICKET ITEMS TO WELL HEELED CUSTOMERS
c16c0203 THEY ARE BUYING TO BEAT THE NEW TAX LAW WHICH WILL END THE DEDUCTION OF SALES TAXES AND SOME INTEREST EXPENSES
c16c0204 AFTER U. S. WARPLANES STRUCK LIBYA LAST APRIL RICHARD ROBINSON DROPPED PLANS FOR A TWO WEEK VACATION IN FRANCE AND IRELAND FEARING AN INCREASE IN TERRORISM
c16c0205 NOW MR. ROBINSON A DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED STOCKBROKER IN BOCA RATON FLORIDA PLANS TO VISIT WEST GERMANY THIS JUNE
c16c0206 BUT IF THEY START THE TERRORISM AGAIN I'LL HAVE TO RECONSIDER HE SAYS
c16c0207 LENDERS AGREE THAT V. A. SHOULD TURN THE PROPERTY OVER TO THEM WHEN FRAUD OR FAULTY UNDERWRITING IS INVOLVED
c16c0208 BUT AS MR. FRENCH ARGUES MANY MORTGAGE DEFAULTS ARE THE PRODUCT OF DEPRESSION IN THE ENERGY PRODUCING STATES NOT NEGLIGENCE
c16c0209 SOME OF THESE LOANS WERE PERFECTLY UNDERWRITTEN BUT THE ECONOMY HAS GONE BAD IN THESE COMMUNITIES HE SAYS
c16c020a SHOULD THE MORTGAGE BANKER BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT
c16c020b THE LOSER IN THIS ISN'T JUST THE MORTGAGE BANKER BUT ALSO THE VETERAN WHO IS LOSING A BENEFIT
c16c020c IF CHARGES ARE MADE WEST GERMANY'S NATIONAL CENTRAL BANK THE BUNDESBANK COULD LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION OF PARKING THAT WOULD INCLUDE A MAJOR REVIEW OF BANKS' BOOKS

c16c020k LAWYERLY MISDEEDS WERE HUSHED UP OR HURRIEDLY RESOLVED
c16c020l CLIENTS WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT SCANDALOUS TO SUE THE FAMILY OR COMPANY LAWYER
c16c020m SUSPICIOUS MERRILL LYNCH CALLED IRWIN L. JACOBS THE MINNEAPOLIS INVESTOR WHOSE VENTURES INCLUDED MINSTAR
c16c020n MR. JACOBS TOLD THE BROKERAGE THAT THE ORDER WAS A FAKE AND DISMISSED IT AS A PRANK

c16c020p THE MINORITY REPORT AGREES WITH THE POINT MADE IN THESE COLUMNS THAT THE ARMS SALES AND DIVERSION WERE FULLY WITHIN THE CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH
c16c020q THE ADMINISTRATION DID PROCEED LEGALLY IN PURSUING BOTH ITS CONTRA POLICY AND THE IRAN ARMS INITIATIVE THE REPORT SAYS
c16c020r IT ADDS NEW EVIDENCE FROM THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY THAT THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL WAS NOT COVERED BY THE BOLAND AMENDMENTS THEIR CONSTITUTIONALITY ASIDE
c16c020s FOR THE NINE MONTHS NET INCREASED TO ABOUT SIX MILLION DOLLARS OR FIFTY NINE CENTS A SHARE FROM THREE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR EARLIER

c16c020x L. S. I. LOGIC ANOTHER BIG SEMICONDUCTOR CONCERN WITH SOME P. C. MAKING CUSTOMERS WAS UNCHANGED AT SEVEN AND THREE QUARTERS
c16c020y BUT A RAFT OF SMALLER ELECTRONICS ISSUES HELPED PUSH THE NASDAQ ELECTRONICS GROUP'S AVERAGE UP MORE THAN ONE PERCENT
c16c020z MR. PEABODY AND OTHERS WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE BANK PURSUE ADDED CAPITAL AND DISPOSE OF TROUBLED LOANS MORE AGGRESSIVELY
c16c0210 FIRST REPUBLIC HOWEVER INSISTS THAT IT ISN'T IN ANY DANGER

c16c0214 ECONOMISTS EXPECT THE SOUTHEAST BUFFERED BY ITS BIG SERVICE ECONOMY TO CONTINUE TO OUTPERFORM THE NATION
c16c0215 BUT SOME OVERBUILT REAL ESTATE MARKETS COULD GET BASHED AND FLORIDA'S INFLUX OF RETIREES JOB SEEKERS AND TOURISTS COULD DWINDLE
c16c0216 EVENTUALLY THE FLIGHT LANDED AT A NEARBY AIRPORT
c16c0217 BUT THE TERMINAL FACILITIES WERE CLOSED SO MR. BARRETT AND FIVE OTHER PASSENGERS HAD TO SCALE A WIRE FENCE TO GET OUT
c16c0218 A NEARBY HOTEL PICKED THEM UP AND CHARGED THEM EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS EACH FOR THE VAN RIDE
c16c0219 CRISP DECISIONS OF COURSE HAVE NEVER BEEN THE STUFF OF POLITICS
c16c021a BUT I HAVE BEEN OPINING ON POLITICAL ISSUES FOR A NATIONAL NEWSPAPER FOR A GENERATION NOW AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN RATIONALITY AND COHERENCE COUNT FOR LESS
c16c021b FRIENDS WITH FAR LONGER EXPERIENCE AT THE JUNCTION OF POLITICS AND IDEAS SAY THE SAME THING
c16c021c THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN SLIPPING DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO PROCEDURAL QUICKSAND UNTIL WE ARE NOW SUNK IN A PROFOUND INSTITUTIONAL AND EVEN CONSTITUTIONAL MORASS
c16c021d FIRST INTERSTATE'S FOURTH QUARTER LOSS RESULTED FROM A PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR ADDITION TO ITS RESERVES AGAINST POSSIBLE FOREIGN DEBT LOSSES
c16c021e BUT EVEN WITHOUT THE RESERVES THE COMPANY SAID EARNINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN FLAT AT ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED WITH THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER
c16c021f FIRST INTERSTATE HAD A SLIGHT DECLINE IN EARNINGS ASSETS AND NEGLIGIBLE GROWTH IN NET INTEREST INCOME
c16c021g NONINTEREST INCOME FELL SEVENTEEN PERCENT PARTLY BECAUSE YEAR EARLIER RESULTS INCLUDED A NINETEEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLAR PRETAX GAIN ON THE SALE OF A BUILDING

c16c021m MOREOVER THEY ARE READY IF NEED BE TO INTERVENE ON EXCHANGE MARKETS
c16c021n THE TRADE BILL WOULD DIRECT PRESIDENTIAL ACTION AGAINST COUNTRIES THAT PERMIT PIRACY OF U. S. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
c16c021o IT WOULD REQUIRE THE PRESIDENT TO IDENTIFY COUNTRIES THAT DON'T PROTECT COPYRIGHTS AND PATENTS AND TO INITIATE EXPEDITED UNFAIR TRADE INVESTIGATIONS IN THE MOST EGREGIOUS CASES
c16c021p THE PRESIDENT COULD DECLINE TO MOVE AGAINST CERTAIN COUNTRIES IF DOING SO WOULD BE AGAINST THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC INTEREST THOUGH
c16c021q CONGRESS WANTS SPEEDY ACTION BECAUSE TIME OFTEN CAN BE CRITICAL IN WINNING PROTECTION FOR CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SUCH AS COMPUTER SOFTWARE WHICH CAN BE COPIED RAPIDLY
c16c021r OF COURSE TO A GREAT EXTENT THE STOCK PRICES OF THE VARIOUS COMPANIES THAT WILL BE REPORTING HIGHER EARNINGS ALREADY REFLECT SHAREHOLDER EXPECTATIONS
c16c021s THAT OBVIOUSLY WILL MUTE THE PRICE MOVEMENTS OF ANY PARTICULAR STOCK WHEN THE COMPANY REPORTS ITS EARNINGS UNLESS ANALYSTS' ESTIMATES ARE SERIOUSLY OUT OF KILTER
c16c021t AS PORTFOLIO STRATEGISTS PUZZLE OVER THE MARKET IMPACT OF THIS WAVE OF GOOD NEWS THEY COME UP WITH SOME SHARPLY DIVERGENT OPINIONS

c16c0220 FOR THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THIRD QUARTER THE MAGAZINE GROUP HAD PRETAX EARNINGS OF SIX POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS ON REVENUE OF FIFTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

c16c0222 ALSO THE COMPANY CITED DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR THREE NEW MAGAZINES
c16c0223 AND FOR THE TIME BEING AT LEAST AGASSI HAS THE UNCLUTTERED MIND OF YOUTH IN HIS FAVOR

c17c020w FLOATING FAILS WHEN GOVERNMENTS TRY TO ESCAPE FROM THE VERDICT OF THE EXCHANGE MARKETS ON THEIR POLICIES BY RESORTING TO DIRECT CONTROLS OVER TRADE AND CAPITAL FLOWS
c17c020x BECAUSE THIS LATTER THREAT IS NOW SO SEVERE THE WORLD IS RIGHT TO TALK ABOUT INTERNATIONAL MONETARY REFORM IF ONLY AS A DELAYING GAME
c17c020y BUT IDEALISTIC TALK SHOULD NOT DECEIVE STABILIZING EXCHANGE RATES REQUIRES DEPENDENCE AND SUBORDINATION NOT THE FREEDOM FOR EVERYBODY TO DO THEIR OWN THING

c19c021t IT MAY BE TRUE THAT FIFTY MILLION FRENCHMEN CAN'T BE WRONG BUT FIFTY MAJOR FORECASTERS CAN BE
c19c021u WHOSE FAULT IS IT THAT THESE FORECASTERS FAILED TO PREDICT THE STRONG GROWTH RATE IN FIRST QUARTER GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT
c19c021v POOR GOVERNMENT STATISTICS ACCORDING TO THE WALL STREET JOURNAL SHAKY STATISTICS POSE PERIL FOR FORECASTERS THE OUTLOOK MAY NINTH

c19c0227 ONE SIMPLE MOTIVATION IS BEHIND THE NETWORKS' PUMPED UP MARKETING EFFORTS DESPERATION
c19c0228 COMPANIES THAT ONCE HAD TO ADVERTISE ON THE NETWORKS IF THEY WANTED TO REACH A MASS AUDIENCE NOW CAN CHOOSE INSTEAD FROM A HOST OF CABLE AND INDEPENDENT STATIONS
c19c0229 AT THE SAME TIME MARKETERS HAVE PULLED MONEY OUT OF ADVERTISING TO SINK IT INTO PROMOTIONS SUCH AS COUPONS AND SWEEPSTAKES IN THE PAST FEW YEARS
c19c022a KEVIN O'CONNELL SALES MANAGER AT TOYOTA OF ORANGE SAID OCTOBER WAS SLOWER THAN USUAL AT THE BIG SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DEALERSHIP

c19c022g ORDERS FOR MILITARY AIRCRAFT HAVE FALLEN TWENTY PERCENT IN THE PAST TWO YEARS ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES
c19c022h AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES PRESTIGIOUS MILITARY DESIGN BUREAUS IN THE SOVIET UNION ARE DEVOTING SUBSTANTIAL MANPOWER TO CIVILIAN PROJECTS
c19c022i THIS GROWING RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES TO SELL PRODUCTS COULD HINDER HEWLETT PACKARD'S ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESS AND MAKE THE COMPANY'S STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS
c19c022j YOU BOUGHT H. P. STOCK IN THE PAST BECAUSE IT HAD MORE CONTROL OVER ITS DESTINY THAN OTHER ELECTRONICS FIRMS MR. WU SAID
c19c022k TODAY H. P. HAS LESS CONTROL OVER ITS FUTURE
c1ac0201 SURVEYS HAVE CONSISTENTLY SHOWN THAT PEOPLE HAVE A LOW OPINION OF OUR PRODUCTS OUR SERVICES AND OUR COMPANIES MR. MAURER SAID

c1ac0203 IT HAS NOT IMPROVED AND IS IN FACT GETTING WORSE
c1ac0204 DREXEL BURNHAM HAD A MAJOR ROLE IN EVERY TRANSACTION UNDER INVESTIGATION IN THE IVAN BOESKY INSIDER TRADING CASE AN ANALYSIS SHOWS
c1ac0205 IT ALSO HAS EMERGED THAT BOESKY HIMSELF WAS A MAJOR INVESTOR IN EVERY INSTANCE
c1ac0206 BOESKY MEANWHILE APPEARS TO HAVE SPEEDED UP THE LIQUIDATION OF HIS OPERATIONS
c1ac0207 OCCIDENTAL OFFICALS SAY THE MINE WILL START COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS NEXT SEPTEMBER MORE THAN TWO YEARS BEHIND SCHEDULE

c1ac0209 ALL BUT TEN PERCENT OF THE OUTPUT IS FOR EXPORT MOSTLY TO JAPAN SOUTH KOREA AND HONG KONG

c1ac020f THE REFUND WILL SHOW UP AS A CREDIT IN FEBRUARY ELECTRIC BILLS THE UNIT SAID
c1ac020h BUT THE POINT HERE IS THAT HE IS TRYING TO ARRANGE IT SO THAT HE WILL STILL WIELD THE REAL POWER FROM BEHIND THE SCENES EVEN AFTER HIS RESIGNATION
c1ac020j WHAT KOREA IS NOW SUFFERING TO OVERCOME IS MAINLY A POLITICAL NOT ECONOMIC PROBLEM
c1ac020k REFORMS THAT DO NOT CHANGE THE PRESENT POLITICAL SYSTEM ARE NOT REFORMS
c1ac020l THE SYSTEM ISN'T ONE HUNDRED PERCENT PERFECT BUT IT'S WORKING REASONABLY WELL A FOREIGN MINISTER OFFICIAL TOLD REPORTERS
c1ac020m THE OFFICIAL SAID THE U. S. HAS BEEN SIMILARLY REASSURED
c1ac020n EVEN SO THE U. S. HAS INDICATED THAT IT WANTS JAPAN TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF HOW JAPANESE TECHNOLOGY IS SOLD AROUND THE WORLD
c1ac020o THE LOAN IS PART OF A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PLAN TO EXPAND THE MINE'S RESERVES AND ALLOW IT TO KEEP OPERATING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY FOUR
c1ac020p WITHOUT THE EXPANSION THE MINE WAS THREATENED WITH CLOSURE NEXT YEAR
c1ac020q CLOSURE WOULD MEAN THE LOSS OF SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTEEN JOBS
c1ac020r HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
c1ac020s TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED

c1ac0211 PERIOD
c1ac0212 DAVID FLEISCHER AN ANALYST AT PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES THINKS TENNECO BY NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETEEN NINETY ONE COULD EARN EIGHT DOLLARS A SHARE FROM EXISTING OPERATIONS

c1ac0214 TENNECO STANDS TO BENEFIT GREATLY FROM A PICKUP AT ITS OIL AND GAS AND FARM EQUIPMENT BUSINESSES HE SAYS
c1ac0215 THE SPOKESMAN ALSO SAID THE LEAGUE'S OWNERS ARE COMMITTED TO PLAYING WITH THEIR CURRENT REPLACEMENT ROSTERS FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON INCLUDING THE SUPER BOWL IF NECESSARY
c1ac0216 THAT MAY BE THE CASE IF MR. UPSHAW CAN BE TAKEN AT HIS WORD
c1ac0217 HE HAS SAID THAT THE PLAYERS WILL REMAIN ON STRIKE FOR THE DURATION IF THE UNION'S OFFER WAS REJECTED

c1ac021b BOB DOLE AL HAIG AND JACK KEMP ALL HAVE PICKED UP THE IRAN CONTRA CLUB TO USE ON MR. BUSH
c1ac021c WE'RE INCLINED TO THINK THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT DESERVES SOME DEFENDING ON THIS POINT
c1ac021d HE ALONE SEEMS WILLING TO SAY THAT A LINE HAS TO BE DRAWN SOMEWHERE IN FRONT OF THE DEAD END POLITICS OF THE IRAN CONTRA AFFAIR
c1ac021e IN AN INTERVIEW MR. EXLEY SAID DEMAND IS STRONG BOTH IN THE U. S. AND IN MAJOR FOREIGN MARKETS WITH PERSONAL COMPUTERS LEADING THE WAY
c1ac021f ALSO THE COMPANY WHICH OBTAINED ABOUT FIFTY FOUR PERCENT OF REVENUE FROM ABROAD LAST YEAR CONTINUES TO BENEFIT FROM THE WEAKER DOLLAR

c1ac021j EVERYONE IS WAITING FOR THE OTHER SHOE TO DROP SAYS GEORGE LOWRY PRESIDENT OF SWANN GALLERIES A NEW YORK AUCTION HOUSE
c1ac021k S. D. I. DESPITE WHAT THE DEFENSE LUDDITES SAY IS NOT AN ADVENTURE IN TECHNOLOGY APPLICATION
c1ac021l IT IS A TOOL OF NATIONAL POLICY AND AS WITH ANY TOOL IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE USED WITH A SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE IN MIND
c1ac021m THE OBJECTIVE LEST WE FORGET IT IS TO PREVENT A GLOBAL NUCLEAR WAR
c1ac021n MANY PARENTS IMPATIENT FOR CHANGE IN THE SCHOOLS RESPOND BY KEEPING THEIR KIDS OUT OF KINDERGARTEN AN EXTRA YEAR
c1ac021o MOTIVES ARE MIXED
c1ac021p SOME SAY THEY WANT TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN OTHERS ANGLE FOR AN AGE ADVANTAGE THAT WILL VAULT THEIR OFFSPRING TO THE HEAD OF THE CLASS THE FOLLOWING YEAR

c1ac021x IN SEVERAL AREAS WHERE RAIN HAS BEEN AMPLE TEXAS WHEAT FARMERS HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED THE STATE'S TWENTY NINE BUSHEL PER ACRE AVERAGE
c1ac021y IF YOU HAVE THE WHEAT THEN PRICES ARE TERRIFIC SAYS MR. MOSIER
c1ac021z BUT THOSE FARMERS THAT AREN'T GETTING THE YIELDS BECAUSE OF THE DROUGHT LOSE OUT TWICE HE SAYS BECAUSE THE HIGH PRICES ARE CUTTING DOWN ON GOVERNMENT SUPPORT PAYMENTS
c1ac0220 THIS WAS ROUGH ON ALL DEBTORS DOMESTIC AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL
c1ac0221 BUT NO ONE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS FOR DOMESTIC DEBTORS AS GRAND AS THOSE OFFICIALLY OFFERED FOR THIRD WORLD DEBTORS
c1ac0222 THE FIRST PART OF THE OFFICIAL PROPOSAL WAS TO REDUCE THE INTEREST BURDEN OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
c1ac0223 SECOND PROMOTE WORLD ECONOMIC RECOVERY
c1ac0224 THIRD NEW LOANS SHOULD BE MADE TO THE DEBTOR NATIONS BY THE BANKS THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE WORLD BANK AND EXPORT CREDIT AGENCIES
c1ac0225 THE CONTRACT NOW UNDER NEGOTIATION IS EXPECTED TO BE SIMILAR IN VOLUME AND SCOPE TO THE CURRENT SEVENTEEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT
c1ac0226 THE CONTRACT CALLS FOR THE UNIT TO PROVIDE ENGINEERING AND OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES RELATED TO THE AGENCY'S ADMINISTRATION OF THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM
c1ac0227 THE ENGINEERING PLANNING AND ARCHITECTURAL CONCERN IS IN THE FINAL YEAR OF ITS CURRENT THREE YEAR CONTRACT WITH THE AGENCY
c1ac0228 SO SO
c1ac0229 THAT MAKES THE PROBLEM A LITTLE HARDER
c1ac022a LET ME THINK FOR A MINUTE
c1ac022b I DON'T KNOW IF THE PARENTS UNDERSTAND HOW SUBTLE THIS NEW AGE MOVEMENT REALLY IS SHE SAYS
c1ac022c THEY DRAW THE KIDS IN WITH FAIRY TALES AND SORCERY
c1ac022d THEIR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO DO AWAY WITH ANYBODY WHO BELIEVES THERE'S SUCH A THING AS EVIL
c1ac022e THREE YEARS AGO WHEN THE MOSLEM LEAGUE CAME INTO THE SHARED POWER ARRANGEMENT MR. IJAZ ALI GOT INTO THE PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY
c1ac022f THERE HE WRUNG THOUSANDS OF RUPEES FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO BUILD ROADS SCHOOLS AND ELECTRIFICATION SYSTEMS IN HIS DISTRICT
c1ac022g THE GOVERNMENT'S IDEA WAS TO OUTFLANK THE P. P. P. OPPOSITION THROUGH PUBLIC WORKS
c1bc0201 BUT WHILE EUREKA PROJECTS ARE MORE EASILY APPROVED THE VAGUENESS OF THEIR FUNDING IS ONE REASON MANY EUROPEAN COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE PROGRAM'S VALUE
c1bc0202 ANOTHER IS ITS LOOSE ORGANIZATION WITH NO CENTRAL SYSTEM YET ESTABLISHED FOR CHECKING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS
c1bc0203 MOST OF THE PROJECTS ADOPTED OVER THE PAST YEAR HAVEN'T GOTTEN OFF THE DRAWING BOARD
c1bc0204 BRITAIN IS LAUNCHING A NATIONWIDE AIDS WARNING CAMPAIGN THAT URGES THE USE OF CONDOMS FOR PEOPLE WHO WON'T RESTRICT THEIR SEXUAL PARTNERS
