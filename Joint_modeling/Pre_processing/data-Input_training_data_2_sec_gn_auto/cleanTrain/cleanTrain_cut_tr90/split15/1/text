c04c021m NAVY WARSHIPS AND AIRCRAFT SEARCHED FOR A MISSING U. S. HELICOPTER IN THE SOUTHERN PERSIAN GULF AS IRAN ATTACKED TWO COMMERCIAL VESSELS
c04c021n THE GUNSHIP CARRYING TWO CREW MEMBERS FAILED TO RETURN TO A CRUISER FOLLOWING MONDAY'S RAIDS ON IRANIAN OIL PLATFORMS AND VESSELS
c04c021o THE PENTAGON ALSO SAID SEVERAL MINES WERE FOUND IN THE AREA
c04c021p SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH OLDER OR LARGER BUSINESSES THINK GEORGE BUSH'S POLICIES WOULD BE THE MOST FAVORABLE FOR SMALL BUSINESS
c04c021q BUT THE VICE PRESIDENT HARDLY WON A RINGING ENDORSEMENT HE RATED ONLY FIVE POINT EIGHT ON A SCALE OF TEN
c04c021r AND AMONG WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS MR. BUSH HAD ONLY A FOUR POINT EIGHT RATING
c04c021s MR. TANAKA WAS AMONG THE FIRST SCIENTISTS TO RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL OF SUPERCONDUCTORS WHICH ARE SUBSTANCES THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRICITY WITH NO RESISTANCE AND THUS NO LOSS OF POWER
c04c021t IF MADE PRACTICAL THEY COULD BRING SPECTACULAR CHANGES TO ALMOST ANY ELECTRICAL PRODUCT OR PROCESS
c04c021u THAT WOULD MEAN VASTLY FASTER AND MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS SUCH AS COMPUTERS CARS AND HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES
c04c021v BUT UNTIL THE RECENT BREAKTHROUGH SUPERCONDUCTORS HAD TO BE CHILLED TO A HOPELESSLY LOW TEMPERATURE TO WORK SO EXCEPT FOR A FEW APPLICATIONS THERE REALLY WAS NO TECHNOLOGY
c04c021w FINALLY THERE'S THE WELFARE PROBLEM
c04c021x NOT ALL WORKERS ARE AS LUCKY AS JOSEPH
c04c021y SOME GET SICK OR INJURED AND LOSE THEIR JOBS
c04c021z OTHERS WHO TURNED THEIR LIFE SAVINGS OVER TO BROKERS IN ORDER TO GET HERE DISCOVER THAT PROMISES OF MONEY MEALS AND LODGING WERE BOGUS
c04c0220 FEAR OF DEPORTATION PREVENTS THEM FROM GOING TO THE POLICE FOR HELP
c04c0221 THERE ARE UNCONFIRMED REPORTS OF WORKERS STARVING TO DEATH HERE
c04c0222 BURNUP AND SIMS HAS INTERESTS IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND SOFT DRINKS AMONG OTHER THINGS
c04c0223 MR. POSNER BEGAN INVESTING IN IT IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND BY THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES CONTROLLED MORE THAN FORTY PERCENT OF ITS SHARES
c04c0224 BUT BURNUP AND SIMS MANAGEMENT WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND AT ONE POINT EIGHTEEN TOP BURNUP AND SIMS QUIT IN PROTEST
c04c0225 BY NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THE COMPANIES WERE EXCHANGING SUITS THAT HAVE LINGERED IN THE COURTS EVER SINCE
c04c0226 THE POTENTIAL REWARD IS SIMPLY NOT WORTH THE RISK AN A. M. GENERAL SPOKESMAN SAID
c04c0227 IF YOU DID A CASH FLOW CHART IT LOOKED AWFUL UNTIL WAY OUT IN THE FUTURE
c04c0228 UNACCEPTABLY AWFUL
c04c0229 THE APPARENT INCONSISTENCY IS JUSTIFIED MAINTAINED ROBERT BURGER CHEVROLET GENERAL MANAGER GIVEN THE GROWING DIFFICULTY IN LAUNCHING MODELS IN AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE FIELD
c04c022a IN ESTABLISHING PRODUCTS WITH CONSUMERS HE SAID IT'S EASIER TO FOCUS AD DOLLARS AND MARKETING EFFORTS IF THERE'S ONLY ONE NAME TO PROMOTE
c04c022b CHEVROLET IS USING THE SAME APPROACH WITH ITS GEO LINE OF IMPORT CARS THAT DEBUTS THIS FALL
c04c022c OFFICIALS OF BOTH SAUDI ARABIA AND TEXACO NOTED THE KINGDOM AND THE COMPANY HAVE HAD AN ASSOCIATION OF MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS IN THE PRODUCTION OF PETROLEUM
c04c022d AND THEIR JOINT VENTURE REPRESENTS BY FAR THE BIGGEST MOVE YET INTO REFINING AND MARKETING BY A MEMBER OF THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES
c04c022e THE JOINT VENTURE WILL RANK TENTH IN TOTAL GASOLINE SALES IN THE U. S.
c04c022f BECAUSE THE AUTO INDUSTRY'S GOOD TIMES ROLLED ON SO LONG EACH COMPANY ASSUMED THAT WHEN THE CRUNCH CAME THE OTHER GUY WOULD GET HURT
c04c022g THAT WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE OF HONDA
c04c022h FOR YEARS WHILE RIVALS DANGLED ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR REBATES AND INTEREST FREE LOANS BEFORE BUYERS HONDA STOOD ABOVE IT ALL
c04c022i IT EFFORTLESSLY SOLD ALL THE CARS IT COULD MAKE IN THE U. S. AND ALL IT COULD SHIP FROM JAPAN
c04c022j S. AND P'S EVENT RISK COVENANT RANKINGS WHICH WERE STARTED LAST MONTH HAVE FIVE CATEGORIES
c04c022k E. THREE STANDS MIDWAY
c04c022l TRADERS HAVE SAID THAT BOWATER BONDS WAS THE BEST RECEIVED DEAL IN THE PAST TWO SESSIONS BECAUSE OF STRONG INVESTOR DEMAND FOR EVENT RISK PROTECTION
c04c022m STILL SOME FIXED INCOME ADVISERS AREN'T CONVINCED THAT THESE FUNDS ARE A GOOD DEAL FOR THE AVERAGE INVESTOR
c04c022n IT'S NOT A GOOD INVESTMENT IN THIS ENVIRONMENT SAYS MARILYN COHEN PRESIDENT OF CAPITAL INSIGHT A BEVERLY HILLS CALIFORNIA BOND TRADING FIRM
c04c022o WITH A POSSIBLE RECESSION AHEAD WHAT IS AN EXCELLENT QUALITY LOAN TODAY MIGHT BE JUNK TOMORROW
c04c022p WITH INCREASED RETURN OVER C. D. RATES ISN'T WORTH IT
c04c022q HITLER AND STALIN WERE FRIENDS SAYS AN OLD MAN TURNING IN A SEAT TO FACE MR. SEMIONENKOV
c04c022r ANOTHER WALKS TO THE BACK OF THE BUS
c04c022s THE POLISH PEOPLE KNEW IT LONG AGO
c04c022t IT WAS THE RUSSIANS
c05c0201 HOWEVER THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION HAS ITS OWN PRIORITIES
c05c0202 IT HAS BEEN PRESSURING GERMANY TO CUT ITS INTEREST RATES TO STIMULATE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND BY IMPLICATION CREATE A BIGGER MARKET FOR U. S. EXPORTS
c05c0203 THIS EXPLAINS THE WAR OF WORDS OVER GERMANY'S REFUSAL TO CUT INTEREST RATES FOR MUCH OF LAST YEAR
c05c0204 THE DISPUTE CAN BE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AFTER THE PRESENT CENTER RIGHT COALITION GOVERNMENT OF CHANCELLOR HELMUT KOHL RECORDS ITS EXPECTED ELECTION VICTORY NEXT WEEK
c05c0205 EVEN WHEN COMPLAINTS ARE FILED THEY CAN BE DIFFICULT TO VERIFY
c05c0206 AGENCIES GENERALLY DON'T USE UNDERCOVER TESTERS POSING AS PROSPECTIVE TENANTS AS THEY DO IN RACE DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS THEY FEAR THAT THE TESTER COULD BE ATTACKED
c05c0207 INSTEAD THEY TRY TO BUILD CASES ON THE TESTIMONY OF CURRENT AND FORMER TENANTS
c05c0208 THE FINANCIAL ENTREPRENEUR IS A SOPHISTICATED PARTICIPANT IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS USING ITS RESOURCES TO HIS ADVANTAGE
c05c0209 IF HE IS A RAIDER MOST OFTEN HE IS INTERESTED IN THE ARBITRAGE BETWEEN THE ACQUISITION VALUE OF THE ENTERPRISE AND THE ULTIMATE VALUE OF ITS PARTS
c05c020a THE LEVERAGED BUYOUT ARTIST ON THE OTHER HAND IS MOST OFTEN A PARTNER WITH MANAGEMENT IN ACQUIRING AND OPERATING THE ENTERPRISE
c05c020b HE MAY FINANCE THE ACQUISITION WITH JUNK BONDS OR HE MAY DO IT PRIVATELY WITH LEADING INSURANCE COMPANIES AND COMMERCIAL BANKS
c05c020c WITHIN A YEAR OR TWO OF ACQUIRING CONTROL HE MAY SEEK TO RAISE NEW MONEY IN THE PUBLIC EQUITY OR DEBT MARKETS
c05c020d RAYTHEON DENIED THAT IT'S FREELY GIVING AWAY JOBS
c05c020e WE AREN'T CRAZY ABOUT OFFSETS BUT WE'D ENTER INTO THEM AS A COMPROMISE BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT IF IT'S THE BEST THAT'S AVAILABLE SAID RAYTHEON SPOKESMAN LAWRENCE MCCRACKEN
c05c020f <NOISE> HE ADDED THAT THERE WERE ALSO SOME POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS BEHIND THE DECISION TO SHARE THE PATRIOT BUSINESS WITH THE THREE U. S. ALLIES
c05c020g IN AN INTERVIEW HOWEVER MR. TAFT SAID HE SIMPLY WANTS TO RETURN THE COMPANY TO FAMILY CONTROL
c05c020h HIS FATHER FOUNDED THE CONCERN IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE
c05c020i THERE HAVE BEEN RUMORS FOR SOME TIME THAT MR. TAFT WAS UNHAPPY WITH THE CHANGES TAKING PLACE AT THE COMPANY AND WAS PREPARING TO RESIGN
c05c020j THE RULING IS A SIGNIFICANT VICTORY FOR THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION AFTER A MAJOR SETBACK ON THE USE OF GRAND JURY MATERIALS IN A NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE SUPREME COURT RULING
c05c020k IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE THE HIGH COURT RULED THAT LAWYERS HANDLING CIVIL CASES IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT NEEDED A COURT ORDER TO GAIN ACCESS TO SECRET GRAND JURY EVIDENCE
c05c020l JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS COMPLAINED THAT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE RULING HAMPERED THEIR INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS
c05c020m THESE CRITICISMS ARE OVERWROUGHT AND UNCONVINCING
c05c020n WHILE PRIVATE OPERATORS WILL CERTAINLY LOBBY IN THEIR OWN INTEREST IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT THEY COULD MANIPULATE PUBLIC OPINION AND LAWMAKERS AS EASILY AS THEIR OPPONENTS SUGGEST
c05c020o NOR IS IT CLEAR THAT PRIVATE PRISON OPERATORS WOULD HAVE TO LOBBY FOR HARSHER SENTENCES
c05c020p GIVEN CURRENT LEVELS OF OVERCROWDING AND PUBLIC SENTIMENT IN FAVOR OF STRICTER SENTENCING THERE WILL BE NO SHORTAGE OF INMATES TO FILL THE NEW FACILITIES
c05c020q THE DECISION HAS CONSIDERABLE IMMEDIATE PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE
c05c020r MORE THAN A DOZEN OTHER APPEALS RAISING THE ARBITRATION ISSUE HAVE BEEN FILED WITH THE SUPREME COURT
c05c020s AND THE QUESTION OF WHETHER ARBITRATION IS REQUIRED IN SECURITIES FRAUD CASES IS PENDING IN HUNDREDS OF LAWSUITS IN FEDERAL COURTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
c05c020t THE CALL IS LIKELY TO PROMPT HOLDERS TO CONVERT THE SHARES INTO COMMON RATHER THAN HAVE THEM REDEEMED
c05c020u EACH DEPOSITARY SHARE CAN BE CONVERTED INTO ONE AND TWO THIRDS COMMON
c05c020v AS LONG AS THE COMMON IS ABOVE SIXTEEN DOLLARS AND FIFTY NINE CENTS A SHARE THE COMPANY NOTED THE CONVERSION VALUE EXCEEDS THE REDEMPTION PRICE
c05c020w THE OFFER EXPIRES AT FIVE P. M. E. D. T. JULY FIRST
c05c020x INDEED HE SEES A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN THE WORLD'S USE OF RESOURCES
c05c020y WE ARE BEING FAR MORE SKILLFUL IN THE USE OF MATERIAL
c05c020z CONSUMPTION IS ON THE INCREASE BUT AT A MUCH LOWER RATE
c05c0210 THE STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF OHIO HAS INVESTED IN REAL ESTATE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND RECENTLY EXPANDED INTO TIMBERLAND
c05c0211 MOST OF OUR REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO IS IN OFFICE AND RETAIL BUILDINGS SAYS STEPHEN A. MITCHELL DIRECTOR OF INVESTMENTS
c05c0212 BUT WITH THOSE YOU'VE GOT THE RISK OF LOCATION TENANTS AND THE ECONOMY
c05c0213 MEANWHILE PRICES HAVE DROPPED DRAMATICALLY IN TIMBERLAND
c05c0214 IN BOTH THE HUNGARIAN AND SUEZ CRISES THE UNITED STATES PROCEEDED IN ACCORD WITH THE RULE OF AVOIDING DIRECT CONFRONTATION WITH THE SOVIET UNION
c05c0215 IN THE HUNGARIAN AFFAIR THIS MEANT DOING NOTHING EXCEPT TALKING BECAUSE TAKING ANY PRACTICAL STEP WOULD AT ONCE HAVE MEANT A CONFRONTATION
c05c0216 IN THE SUEZ AFFAIR THE AVOIDANCE OF CONFRONTATION WENT ALL THE WAY TO COLLABORATION
c05c0217 ALSO PROVIDING SOME SOLACE FOR MUNICIPAL BOND PROFESSIONALS IS THE FACT THAT COMMERCIAL BANKS ARE BECOMING MORE ACTIVE AS UNDERWRITERS RATHER THAN AS INVESTORS
c05c0218 THIS MEANS THEY WILL NEED TO HIRE MORE INVESTMENT BANKERS
c05c0219 THE BANKS' MOVE IS PART OF THEIR EFFORT TO TEST AND EXPAND THE LIMITS OF SECURITIES AND BANKING LAWS
c05c021a A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ISSUE OF HOUSEHOLD FINANCE CORPORATION SEVEN YEAR NOTES WAS OFFERED THROUGH UNDERWRITERS LED BY MERRILL LYNCH CAPITAL MARKETS
c05c021b THE TEN PERCENT NOTES WERE PRICED AT PAR AND THE RETURN IS ZERO POINT SEVEN TWO OF A PERCENTAGE POINT ABOVE THE RATE ON COMPARABLE TREASURY NOTES
c05c021c THE NOTES ARE RATED DOUBLE A THREE BY MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE INCORPORATED AND DOUBLE A MINUS BY STANDARD AND POOR'S CORPORATION
c05c021d BY SEPTEMBER THE WEAKNESS OF COORDINATED INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO PREVENT DOLLAR DECLINES FINALLY SURFACED
c05c021e IN RESPONSE TO INCREASING INFLATION FEARS GERMANY AND JAPAN BEGAN TIGHTENING MONETARY POLICY AND RAISING INTEREST RATES
c05c021f IN UNTIMELY FASHION SECRETARY BAKER REAFFIRMED THE ADMINISTRATION'S INTENT TO PREVENT DOLLAR DECLINES
c05c021g IN ANTICIPATION OF THE SUBSTANTIAL FED TIGHTENING THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO PREVENT DOLLAR DECLINES U. S. INTEREST RATES SKYROCKETED
c05c021h THE SEEDS OF MARKET DISCONTENT WERE SOWN
c05c021i AFTER LOSING BUSINESS TO CHEAPER MEXICAN IMPORTS IN RECENT YEARS MR. MOORE ADMITS WE JUST CANNOT COMPETE WITH THEM
c05c021j HE ADDS I REALIZE A TRADE WAR CAN MEAN HIGHER PRICES OR A SHORTAGE OF PRODUCTS BUT NOW IS THE TIME TO PROTECT OUR DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES
c05c021k ALL WE NEED IS A LITTLE BIT OF RELIEF TO GET BACK ON TRACK
c05c021l HOURLY COMPENSATION AT NONFINANCIAL FIRMS ROSE AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF THREE PERCENT IN NOMINAL TERMS BUT FELL ZERO POINT EIGHT PERCENT WHEN ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION
c05c021m SECOND QUARTER HOURLY COMPENSATION ROSE AT AN ANNUAL NOMINAL RATE OF TWO POINT SIX PERCENT BUT FELL TWO POINT TWO PERCENT ON AN INFLATION ADJUSTED BASIS
c05c021n UNIT LABOR COSTS INCREASED AT A ZERO POINT FOUR PERCENT YEARLY RATE IN THE THIRD QUARTER AFTER A TWO PERCENT RATE OF GAIN IN THE SECOND QUARTER
c05c021o IN AFGHANISTAN HE ADDS PEOPLE HAVE STAYED IN THE ARMY BECAUSE THEY NEED TO FEED THEIR CHILDREN AND BECAUSE THEY WORRY ABOUT THEIR FAMILIES
c05c021p THEY JOIN OFFENSIVES BECAUSE THE SOVIETS ARE AT THEIR BACKS WITH GUNS
c05c021q NOW THAT THEY KNOW THEY HAVEN'T ANYONE EITHER TO PROTECT THEM OR THREATEN THEM IT WILL HAVE AN EFFECT ON MORALE
c05c021r TAGAMET FOR INSTANCE IS ONE OF THE MOST WIDELY PRESCRIBED AND EFFECTIVE DRUGS FOR TREATING ULCERS
c05c021s HOWEVER IT HAS BEEN KNOWN TO TRIGGER SUCH ADVERSE REACTIONS AS MILD AND TEMPORARY DIARRHEA DIZZINESS DROWSINESS AND RASH
c05c021t TAGAMET ALSO CAN CAUSE MENTAL CONFUSION AGITATION PSYCHOSIS DEPRESSION ANXIETY HALLUCINATIONS AND DISORIENTATION
c05c021u DOCTORS SAY THAT SOME PATIENTS IF INFORMED OF THOSE POTENTIAL OUTCOMES MIGHT CHOOSE NOT TO TAKE THE MEDICINE
c05c021v YOU'VE HAD A TREMENDOUS FALLOFF HERE THAT'S ONLY GOING TO GET BIGGER AS WE APPROACH THE SUMMER DOLDRUMS ONE TRADER SAYS
c05c021w HE ESTIMATES THAT INSTITUTIONAL VOLUME HAS TUMBLED FROM YEAR EARLIER LEVELS BY FORTY PERCENT SO FAR THIS MONTH AND THIRTY PERCENT FOR THE YEAR TO DATE
c05c021x LET'S FACE IT HE SAYS WE NEED COMMISSIONS TO PAY THE BILLS
c05c021y THIS YEAR THROUGH MAY TWENTY THIRD THE FUND WAS ABOUT A HALF PERCENTAGE POINT AHEAD OF THE S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED'S TWO POINT FOUR PERCENT RISE
c05c021z GOING INTO NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT IT EMPHASIZED CYCLICAL STOCKS SUCH AS CHEMICALS AND GAVE LESS WEIGHT THAN MOST FUNDS TO FINANCIAL AND UTILITY STOCKS
c05c0220 IT ALSO HAD NEARLY TWENTY PERCENT OF ASSETS IN CONVERTIBLE BONDS A DEFENSIVE TACTIC
c05c0221 FOR HIS PART MR. BUSH DEFENDS HIS PROPOSALS AS NEEDED AND STRESSES THAT THEY WOULD BE PAID FOR THROUGH CUTS IN SPENDING
c05c0222 THE PROPOSALS DON'T AMOUNT TO AN ASSAULT ON THE CURRENT TAX STRUCTURE CONTENDS BUSH SPOKESMAN STEPHEN HART
c05c0223 THEY ARE LASER LIKE OPENINGS IN THE TAX STRUCTURE FOR SPECIFIC REASONS HE SAYS
c05c0224 ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN FACTORED INTO HIS FLEXIBLE FREEZE OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING
c05c0225 HE ISN'T GOING TO RAISE TAXES PERIOD <NOISE>
c05c0226 THE EXTENT OF THE CONTAMINATION WON'T BE CLEAR FOR SEVERAL WEEKS
c05c0227 IN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AS MUCH AS TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE MIDWEST CORN CROP COULD BE THREATENED
c05c0228 MOST OF THAT CROP IS STILL IN THE FIELD
c05c0229 MINNESOTA AND ILLINOIS OFFICIALS ARE JUST BEGINNING TO SCREEN THE HARVEST
c05c022a ELEVATORS IN THOSE STATES REPORTEDLY HAVE REJECTED CORN THEY DEEM SUSPICIOUS
c05c022b WORRIED THAT CONTAMINATED CORN MAY HAVE BEEN FED TO DAIRY COWS SOME WISCONSIN DAIRIES ARE TESTING MILK FOR AFLATOXIN
c05c022c TO COPE IN THE EARLY GOING THE TALL LEAN MR. HAUPTFUHRER CAN DRAW ON SOLID EXPERIENCE EMPLOYEE LOYALTY AND CONSIDERABLE INVESTOR SUPPORT

c05c022i MANY NEARBY CHINESE FACTORIES SIMPLY SHUT DOWN TWO OR THREE DAYS A WEEK FOR WANT OF ENERGY
c05c022j MOREOVER TWO THOUSAND WORKERS AT THE TIANJIN ALUMINUM PRODUCTS FACTORY RECENTLY WERE ORDERED HOME BECAUSE THE COMPANY COULDN'T GET ENOUGH RAW MATERIALS
c05c022k AT ONE POINT THIS YEAR SUPPLY SHORTAGES FORCED A THIRD OF THE NATION'S ALUMINUM FACTORIES TO CLOSE

c05c022m INDUSTRIELLE OUT OF ITS CASH HOARD OR THROUGH SHORT TERM LOANS
c05c022n ONE SOURCE SAID SUEZ IF VICTORIOUS WOULD LIKELY RESELL PART OF ITS STAKE IN COMPANY
c05c022o INDUSTRIELLE TO RECOUP PART OF ITS COSTS
c05c022p IT COULD ALSO SELL OFF COMPANY
c05c022q INDUSTRIELLE ASSETS SUCH AS REAL ESTATE AND MINORITY INDUSTRIAL HOLDINGS ESTIMATED AT BETWEEN ONE BILLION AND TWO BILLION FRANCS
c05c022r IN APRIL DREXEL AGREED TO PAY SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND PLEAD GUILTY TO SIX FELONY COUNTS RELATED TO A FEDERAL INSIDER TRADING INVESTIGATION
c05c022s THE PLEA AGREEMENT WAS MADE IN CONJUNCTION WITH A BROAD SETTLEMENT OF SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
c05c022t BECAUSE THE FIRM AGREED THAT IT COMMITTED FELONIES SECURITIES COMMISSIONERS IN MOST STATES CAN AUTOMATICALLY REVOKE DREXEL'S LICENSE TO DO BUSINESS
c06c0201 THE STATUTE ALLOWS FOR A GREAT DEAL OF LATITUDE AGREES ARTHUR CHRISTY THE FIRST SPECIAL PROSECUTOR APPOINTED UNDER THE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT LAW
c06c0202 IN PAST INVESTIGATIONS HE NOTES THE FOCUS HAS BEEN QUITE NARROW
c06c0203 BUT IN EACH CASE HE SUGGESTS IT'S UP TO THE COUNSEL HE CERTAINLY HAS THE POWERS
c06c0204 BUT WHILE EUREKA PROJECTS ARE MORE EASILY APPROVED THE VAGUENESS OF THEIR FUNDING IS ONE REASON MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE PROGRAM'S VALUE
c06c0205 ANOTHER IS ITS LOOSE ORGANIZATION WITH NO CENTRAL SYSTEM YET ESTABLISHED FOR CHECKING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS
c06c0206 MOST OF THE PROJECTS ADOPTED OVER THE PAST YEAR HAVEN'T GOTTEN OFF THE DRAWING BOARD
c06c0207 BRITAIN IS LAUNCHING A NATIONWIDE AIDS WARNING CAMPAIGN THAT URGES THE USE OF CONDOMS FOR PEOPLE WHO WON'T RESTRICT THEIR SEXUAL PARTNERS

c06c0220 IF IT COMES IN ZERO POINT FIVE PERCENT OR HIGHER THAT'S GOING TO BE BAD FOR BONDS MR. BOZIAN WARNED
