c0uc0213 LAST YEAR THE FIRM IS SAID TO HAVE EARNED MORE THAN SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS
c0uc0215 IT IS AMONG MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED WORDS PHRASES AND SYMBOLS FOR WHICH THE ASSOCIATION HAS GAINED TRADEMARK PROTECTION IN CANADA
c0uc0216 A SPOKESMAN FOR THE U. S. OLYMPIC COMMITTEE SAID MOST SUCH WORDS AND SYMBOLS ARE SIMILARLY PROTECTED IN THE U. S.
c0uc0217 IDEALLY A CAMPAIGN'S FREE MEDIA AND PAID MEDIA MESH SEAMLESSLY ONE REINFORCING THE OTHER
c0uc0218 PRESIDENT REAGAN'S NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR RE ELECTION EFFORT MAY HAVE SET A NEW STANDARD IN THIS REGARD
c0uc0219 RALLIES WERE METICULOUSLY STAGED TO REINFORCE THE CAMPAIGN'S MESSAGE OF PATRIOTISM AND OPTIMISM
c0uc021a THE RESULT WAS NEWS FOOTAGE THAT LOOKED LIKE THE CAMPAIGN'S COMMERCIALS
c0uc021b THE COMPANY WOULD MAKE A TENDER OFFER FOR ITS PREFERRED SHARES AT TWENTY ONE DOLLARS AND FORTY CENTS A SHARE
c0uc021c MOST OF THE MORE THAN FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS REQUIRED TO RETIRE THE PREFERRED STOCK WOULD BE BORROWED MR. MOORE SAID
c0uc021d AT THE SAME TIME THE COMPANY WOULD RESTRUCTURE EXISTING BANK LOANS
c0uc021e IN EXPORT LED ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER MAKERS KYOCERA SLIPPED NINETY TO FIVE THOUSAND TWENTY
c0uc021f MATSUSHITA ELECTRIC INDUSTRIAL WAS UNCHANGED AT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTY
c0uc021g N. E. C. ROSE TEN TO ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED TEN
c0uc021h SONY ROSE TWENTY TO FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY
c0uc021i TECHNICALLY THE STOPGAP BILL WILL LEAVE THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF MONEY OVER THE WEEKEND
c0uc021j BUT THAT SHOULD HAVE LITTLE PRACTICAL EFFECT SINCE MOST OPERATIONS WILL BE CLOSED DURING THAT TIME
c0uc021k CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS HOPE HOWEVER IT WILL PRESSURE LAWMAKERS TO FINISH THEIR WORK BEFORE MONDAY
c0uc021l CHRYSLER CORPORATION HAS EXTENDED HOLIDAYS AT FOUR PLANTS AND IN SOME CASES INDEFINITELY SLOWED PRODUCTION
c0uc021m A TOTAL OF TEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED WORKERS ARE AFFECTED
c0uc021n AND CHAIRMAN LEE A. IACOCCA SAYS CHRYSLER WILL ANNOUNCE A PERMANENT PLANT CLOSING EARLY THIS YEAR
c0uc021o MR. KIELLEY PLANS TO USE EXISTING TOWERS PERRIN OFFICES TO OPEN BRANCHES OF BOTH CRESAP AND A SMALLER TOWERS PERRIN INSURANCE UNIT
c0uc021p WE'LL USE THE BENEFITS BUSINESS AS A BEACHHEAD HE SAYS
c0uc021q OPENING A CRESAP OFFICE IN TOKYO WHERE TOWERS PERRIN ALREADY HAS A BENEFITS OFFICE WOULD BE OF HIGHEST PRIORITY
c0uc021r BUT THE EXPERIENCE SHOWED THERE WAS A MUCH BIGGER VIEWING AUDIENCE AND MARKET THAN HOME SHOPPING HAD REALIZED
c0uc021s BOTH M. C. I. AND HOME SHOPPING QUICKLY ADDED CAPACITY
c0uc021t BEFORE THE DELUGE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CALLS WAS CONSIDERED A HEAVY DAY
c0uc021u NOW AS MANY AS ONE POINT FIVE MILLION CALLS ARE HANDLED A DAY MR. TROUPE SAYS
c0uc021v THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO START SHIPPING THE MACHINE THIS MONTH
c0uc021w BUT DON'T TOSS ALL YOUR PADS OF PAPER INTO THE GARBAGE YET
c0uc021x THE MACHINE HAS SOME LIMITATIONS
c0uc021y YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THE STYLUS BETWEEN CHARACTERS
c0uc021z THE MACHINE ALSO CONVERTS HANDWRITING AT THE SLUGGISH PACE OF TWO SYMBOLS PER SECOND
c0uc0220 AND AT TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS TO THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS IT WILL COST MORE THAN MOST CONVENTIONAL PORTABLE P. C.S
c0uc0221 PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY OF AMERICA WHICH PARTICIPATED IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE BUY OUT HOLDS ABOUT A THIRTY PERCENT STAKE IN FOODMAKER
c0uc0222 A FOODMAKER SPOKESMAN DECLINED YESTERDAY TO COMMENT ON ANY INVOLVEMENT PRUDENTIAL MAY HAVE IN THE LATEST BUY OUT PROPOSAL
c0uc0223 CERTAIN FOODMAKER EXECUTIVES ALSO MAY BUY STAKES IN F. M. ACQUISITION THE COMPANY SAID
c0uc0224 THE DISPUTE IS A CLASSIC CONFRONTATION BETWEEN MARKET PHILOSOPHIES
c0uc0225 WASHINGTON BELIEVES THAT JAPAN PROFITS FROM FREE U. S. MARKETS AND SHOULD RECIPROCATE WITH COMPLETELY FREE JAPANESE MARKET
c0uc0226 TOKYO GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS CLAIM TO FAVOR FREE MARKETS IN PRACTICE THEY OFTEN ARE LOATH TO RELINQUISH COMPLETE CONTROL ESPECIALLY IN PROMISING INDUSTRIES
c0uc0227 THE RICHMOND VIRGINIA MEDIA CONCERN SAID SALES AND PROFITS FROM ITS NEWSPRINT OPERATIONS WERE AHEAD OF YEAR EARLIER LEVELS
c0uc0228 ITS CABLE SYSTEM CONTINUED TO GAIN SUBSCRIBERS NOW TOTALING MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND
c0uc0229 REVENUE PER SUBSCRIBER IS EXCEEDING FORECASTS MEDIA GENERAL SAID ADDING THAT IT PLANS TO INCREASE RATES AN AVERAGE OF EIGHT PERCENT BEGINNING IN JANUARY
c0uc022a BUT FREEDOM ISN'T AN ACCIDENT
c0uc022b IT IS THE RESULT OF PAINSTAKING WORK TO MAINTAIN THE STRUCTURE OF LIBERTY AGAINST INEVITABLE EROSION AT THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNMENT
c0uc022c I THOUGHT THAT MY WORK FOR THE A. C. L. U. WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF MAINTAINING FREEDOM FOR EVERYONE
c0uc022d I NOW CONFESS MY ERROR AND EMBRACE LEADER BUSH'S PERCEPTION THAT THE A. C. L. U. IS A POLITICALLY SUSPECT LIBERAL CONSPIRACY
c0uc022e HE WAS A DIGGER THEN BUT HE FOUND THIS DIAMOND LYING ON THE GROUND
c0uc022f HE FELL ON IT SPEECHLESS IN HIS EXCITEMENT CLUTCHING IT IN HIS FIST
c0uc022g HIS FELLOW DIGGERS AT FIRST FEARED MR. SCHALL HAD SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK
c0vc0201 THE DEPARTMENT ALSO SAID THAT PRODUCTIVITY FOR NONFINANCIAL COMPANIES INCREASED AT A ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT ANNUAL RATE IN THE THIRD QUARTER A PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE
c0vc0202 THE ESTIMATE IS BASED ON AN INCREASE IN OUTPUT OF ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT AND AN INCREASE IN HOURS WORKED OF ONE POINT ONE PERCENT
c0vc0203 THIS WAS THE FIRST QUARTER IN WHICH PRODUCTIVITY INCREASED IN THE NONFINANCIAL SECTOR SINCE THE THIRD QUARTER OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
c0vc0204 ANALYSTS SAID THE ECONOMY APPEARS EVEN WEAKER SO FAR IN THE FOURTH QUARTER
c0vc0205 THE ECONOMICS MINISTRY YESTERDAY SAID THE INFLOW OF ORDERS TO MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY FELL A PRELIMINARY TWO PERCENT IN OCTOBER FROM SEPTEMBER
c0vc0206 THAT FOLLOWED NEWS EARLIER IN THE WEEK THAT INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION WAS STAGNANT IN OCTOBER
c0vc0207 SO FAR ILLEGAL FOREIGN WORKERS AREN'T TAKEN AS A JOB THREAT BY JAPANESE WORKERS
c0vc0208 BUT JAPANESE UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS BECAUSE OF THE YEN'S STRENGTH POSING A KNOTTY PROBLEM FOR THE GOVERNMENT
c0vc0209 MANY JAPANESE COMPANIES IN SUCH INDUSTRIES AS STEEL AND SHIPBUILDING ARE CUTTING THEIR LABOR FORCES
c0vc020a THE U. S. WOULDN'T BE SORRY TO SEE THE SOVIET PEACE OFFENSIVE FALTER
c0vc020b SOME THINK THE RUSSIANS HOPE THEIR EFFORT WILL FOMENT DISCORD IN PAKISTAN WHERE OPPOSITION PARTIES MAY USE IT TO OPPOSE GOVERNMENT POLICY OF HARBORING AFGHAN GUERRILLAS
c0vc020c MEANWHILE THE WAR CONTINUES TO DAMAGE THE SOVIETS' THIRD WORLD RELATIONS WHILE DRAINING THEIR ECONOMY AND MILITARY
c0vc020d IN RECENT YEARS THE BUDGET EFFORT HAS CONSISTED OF MONTHS OF WAITING AT THE END OF WHICH COSMETIC SOLUTIONS SUCH AS ASSET SALES HAVE EMERGED
c0vc020e THE DRONING TEDIUM IS A DRAIN ON THE STRENGTH OF THE CONGRESS SAYS FORMER HOUSE REPUBLICAN LEADER JOHN RHODES
c0vc020f IT HAS CAUSED THE CONGRESS TO BECOME MORIBUND AND UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING
c0vc020g HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
c0vc020h TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
c0vc020i THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
c0vc020j AND WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT GROUPS WAVING THE COMPETITIVENESS FLAG WON'T THE ARGUMENT GET A LITTLE SHOPWORN
c0vc020k SAYS MR. KAY IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT IMPROVING U. S. COMPETITIVENESS ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS HAS TO BE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
c0vc020l BUT YES TO THE EXTENT THIS TOWN BECOMES CYNICAL ABOUT COMPETITIVENESS BEING USED TO COVER EVERYTHING ON FOUR LEGS IT WILL HURT US
c0vc020m BY AND LARGE OPEC IS PREPARED TO SIT IT OUT SAID A SENIOR OPEC MINISTER WHO ASKED NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED
c0vc020n THERE MAY BE SOME WEAKER MEMBERS AMONG US BUT OPEC AS A WHOLE ISN'T OVERPRODUCING
c0vc020o THE PROBLEM IS SPECULATION BY TRADERS THAT VERGES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE
c0vc020p ETHICS CONSULTANTS ON THE OTHER HAND SHOULD BE CLINICIANS AND TEACH DECISION MAKING SKILLS TO PRACTICING PHYSICIANS WHEN DOING CASE CONSULTATION
c0vc020q COMPETENCY IN MEDICINE AND TRAINING IN ETHICS ARE REQUIRED TO SOLVE MORAL PROBLEMS IN PATIENT CARE
c0vc020r EVEN MORE IMPORTANT HOWEVER IS THE INDIVIDUAL CONSULTANT'S ABILITY TO TEACH PRACTITIONERS TO FORM THEIR OWN CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR SOLVING ETHICAL PROBLEMS
c0vc020s WHEN SEEKING TO MAKE THE FAIREST AND MOST ETHICAL DECISIONS LET'S GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT AT THE PATIENT'S BEDSIDE NOT IN A COMMITTEE ROOM
c0vc020t THE PROBLEM ACCORDING TO VENTURE CAPITALISTS WHO READ HUNDREDS OF BUSINESS PLANS EACH YEAR IS THAT MOST ENTREPRENEURS GET THEIR PRIORITIES REVERSED
c0vc020u IN THEIR RUSH TO GET THE NEW IDEA LAUNCHED THEY DON'T SPEND ENOUGH TIME PREPARING THEIR BUSINESS PLAN
c0vc020v THEN THEY EXPECT A POTENTIAL PARTNER OR LENDER TO SPEND THREE HOURS READING IT
c0vc020w IN ADDITION BY CONSENTING TO RORER'S BID ROBINS MAY HAVE PUT ITSELF UP FOR SALE
c0vc020x THE WHOLE THING COULD STILL DETERIORATE INTO AN AUCTION SAID A LAWYER WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE MANVILLE CORPORATION BANKRUPTCY LAW CASE
c0vc020y OTHER BIDDERS COULD COME IN
c0vc020z HE ALSO RELIED HEAVILY ON ADVERTISING RATHER THAN ON DIRECT MAILING WHICH IS BY FAR THE MOST COMMON WAY FOR NEWSLETTER PUBLISHERS TO SOLICIT SUBSCRIBERS
c0vc0210 THIS UNUSUAL STRATEGY EVOLVED FROM A SMALL AD PLACED IN A BUSINESS MAGAZINE
c0vc0211 THE NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR AD GENERATED ENOUGH SUBSCRIPTIONS TO PAY FOR ITSELF IN A WEEK SO MR. KOBREN BEGAN ADVERTISING IN OTHER PUBLICATIONS
c0vc0212 OF HIS COMPANY'S ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN OPERATING EXPENSES LAST YEAR FULLY HALF WENT FOR MARKETING
c0vc0213 THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATION OF AN AGREEMENT AND THE APPROVAL OF TRI STAR DIRECTORS SHAREHOLDERS AND COCA COLA DIRECTORS
c0vc0214 IT ALSO WOULD HAVE TO SATISFY VARIOUS REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
c0vc0215 COCA COLA SAID IT HOPES TO COMPLETE THE TRANSACTION BY THE END OF THIS YEAR
c0vc0216 BECAUSE OF COCA COLA'S SIZABLE STAKE IN TRI STAR THE MERGER IS EXPECTED TO BE CARRIED OUT
c0vc0217 THE ADDED INVESTMENT COMES AT A TIME OF CONTINUING RED INK AT THE TELEVISION VENTURE AND AMID WIDESPREAD SPECULATION THAT NEWS CORPORATION WAS PLANNING TO REDUCE ITS INVESTMENT
c0vc0218 IN THE YEAR ENDED JUNE THIRTIETH SATELLITE TELEVISION POSTED A PRETAX LOSS OF FIVE POINT SIX NINE MILLION POUNDS ON REVENUE OF EIGHT MILLION POUNDS THE SPOKESWOMAN SAID
c0vc0219 IT STILL IS POSSIBLE THAT NEWS INTERNATIONAL MAY CUT ITS STAKE SHE SAID
c0vc021a IT IS CONCEIVABLE AT SOME POINT THAT THE THING COULD BEGIN TO MUSHROOM HE SAID
c0vc021b IF THAT HAPPENS THEN WHAT HAS GOT TO BE DONE TO PRESERVE THE ECONOMY AND PREVENT IT FROM BREAKING APART IS DANGEROUSLY HIGH INTEREST RATES
c0vc021c IT WOULD CAUSE A TREMENDOUS CONTRACTION IN THE ECONOMY
c0vc021d THE PROGRAM APPLIES TO STOCK OF RECORD OCTOBER SECOND
c0vc021e THE ELIGIBLE SHAREHOLDERS MAY OWN FEWER THAN ONE HUNDRED SHARES IN ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANIES
c0vc021f MERRILL LYNCH SAID IT WILL RESELL THE SHARES ON THE OPEN MARKET
c0vc021g NONETHELESS THE TALKS WERE MARKED BY AN EASING OF TRADE TENSIONS IN CONTRAST WITH THE COURSE OF RELATIONS IN PREVIOUS YEARS
c0vc021h U. S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE CLAYTON YEUTTER SAID THE TWO SIDES WERE HANDLING TRADE RELATIONS AS WELL AS AT ANY OTHER TIME IN RECENT MEMORY
c0vc021i BUT HE WARNED OF ADDITIONAL CONFRONTATION IF NO PROGRESS WAS MADE ON FARM ISSUES THAT ARE ON THE FRONT BURNER
c0vc021j NOTHING HAS BEEN DECIDED
c0vc021k NOTHING HAS BEEN RULED OUT SENATOR BYRD SAID AFTER THE MEETING WITH LABOR
c0vc021l WE WILL CONTINUE TO MEET TO ACHIEVE THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE TRADE BILL TO SERVE THE WORKING MEN AND WOMEN AND INDUSTRIES OF THIS COUNTRY
c0vc021m GENLYTE DESIGNS AND MAKES LIGHTING FIXTURES AND ELECTRONIC LIGHTING CONTROLS
c0vc021n OTHER BAIRNCO UNITS MAKE ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS COMPOSITE MATERIALS AND ELECTROMAGNETIC SHIELDING SYSTEMS
c0vc021o IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN NEW YORKBASED BAIRNCO EARNED TWENTY EIGHT POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS OR TWO DOLLARS AND SIXTY EIGHT CENTS A SHARE
c0vc021p AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING OF HIGHER FARM PRICES
c0vc021q BUT HIGHER FARM PRICES WOULD ADD TO AN ALREADY STEEP INFLATION RATE
c0vc021r SO BEIJING OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY TALK OF TYING WAGES TO INFLATION AN IDEA REMINISCENT OF THE WAGE INDEXATION TRIED IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS
c0vc021s NOW HOWEVER IT APPEARS INCREASINGLY LIKELY THAT MR. MITTERRAND WILL DISSOLVE THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND CALL A NEW ELECTION
c0vc021t POLLS SHOW THAT THE SOCIALISTS HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF WINNING AN ABSOLUTE MAJORITY IF ELECTIONS WERE HELD NOW ENABLING MESSRS.
c0vc021u MITTERRAND AND ROCARD TO GOVERN WITHOUT RELYING ON THE CENTRISTS
c0vc021v A BIG PART OF THE REASON FOR WOOD'S SUCCESS IS THE NEW TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS FOR WOOD PANELS WITH A STEEL CORE
c0vc021w BESIDES NARROWING THE PRICE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WOOD AND METAL SYSTEMS THESE TECHNIQUES PROVIDED THE PRECISION NEEDED IN DESIGNING PANEL SYSTEMS THAT MUST FIT TOGETHER
c0vc021x ALMOST ALL THE MAJOR OFFICE FURNITURE MANUFACTURERS HAVE ACQUIRED THE ABILITY TO MAKE WOOD SYSTEMS IN RECENT YEARS
c0vc021y REGULATORS IN STATES THAT HAD ALLOWED TARGETED MAILINGS BEFORE THE COURT'S RULING SAY COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN RARE
c0vc021z FOR THE MOST PART LAWYERS HAVE BEHAVED IN AN ETHICAL RESPONSIBLE MANNER SAYS THOMAS JOHNSON CHAIRMAN OF THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION COMMISSION ON ADVERTISING
c0vc0220 MOST COMPLAINTS HE ADDS ARE MADE BY OTHER LAWYERS WHOSE CLIENTS HAVE RECEIVED LETTERS FROM OTHER ATTORNEYS
c0vc0221 THAT NEWS SENT THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE ON A GIDDY RISE OF MORE THAN FIFTY POINTS
c0vc0222 BUT INVESTORS MAY NEED TO BE SHOWN MORE
c0vc0223 FRIDAY'S VOLUME AFTER SUBTRACTING A BIG DIVIDEND CAPTURE TRADE WAS ONLY MODERATE AT AROUND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION SHARES

c0vc0228 MAYTAG IS THE LEADING LAUNDRY APPLIANCE COMPANY IN THE U. S. SAID CHARLES RYAN AN ANALYST WITH MERRILL LYNCH RESEARCH
c0vc0229 HOOVER IS THE LEADING LAUNDRY COMPANY OUTSIDE THE U. S.
c0vc022a IT'S A GOOD FIT
c0vc022b NOT ALL BLACK COLLEGES ARE ON THE ROPES
c0vc022c IN FACT A NUMBER OF ELITE INSTITUTIONS ARE THRIVING IN PART BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL FUND RAISING EFFORTS
c0vc022d LAST WEEK FOR INSTANCE MR. COSBY AND HIS WIFE CAMILLE DONATED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SPELMAN COLLEGE A BLACK WOMEN'S COLLEGE IN ATLANTA
c0vc022e THE DOLLAR WAS CONFINED TO FAIRLY NARROW RANGES IN ASIAN AND EARLY EUROPEAN TRADING AS MARKET PARTICIPANTS CONCENTRATED ON MARK YEN TRADING
c0vc022f THE GERMAN CURRENCY TRADED IN A RANGE BETWEEN SEVENTY THREE POINT THREE OH YEN AND SEVENTY THREE POINT SIX FIVE YEN THROUGH MOST OF NEW YORK TRADING
c0vc022g AT THE NEW YORK FINISH THE MARK WAS UNCHANGED AT SEVENTY THREE POINT FOUR SIX YEN
c0vc022h HE WAS A DIGGER THEN BUT HE FOUND THIS DIAMOND LYING ON THE GROUND
c0vc022i HE FELL ON IT SPEECHLESS IN HIS EXCITEMENT CLUTCHING IT IN HIS FIST
c0vc022j HIS FELLOW DIGGERS AT FIRST FEARED MR. SCHALL HAD SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK
c0wc0201 COMMERCIAL BANKS ARE SEEKING THIS KIND OF BUSINESS BECAUSE SOME OF THEIR LINES LENDING TO BLUE CHIP CORPORATIONS FOR EXAMPLE HAVE DRIED UP
c0wc0202 BIG COMPANIES NOW ISSUE THEIR OWN PAPER
c0wc0203 THE OLD GLASS STEAGALL ARGUMENTS AIMED AT LIMITING RISK AND DANGERS THAT BIG BANKS WOULD END UP CONTROLLING INDUSTRY LOOK MORE AND MORE DATED
c0wc0204 INVESTMENT BANKS PROVIDE BILLIONS IN BRIDGE LOANS FOR CORPORATE RESTRUCTURINGS AND TAKEOVERS
c0wc0205 INVESTMENT BANKS SEEKING MORE CASH WILL BE ABLE TO TEAM UP WITH COMMERCIAL BANKS WITHOUT HAVING TO LOOK ABROAD AS GOLDMAN SACHS DID TO FIND JAPAN'S SUMITOMO BANK
c0wc0206 BUT THE NEW LAW ALSO CONTAINS NEGATIVES FOR MUNICIPAL BONDS
c0wc0207 FOR PEOPLE WHO MUST PAY THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX THE PRIVATE PURPOSE VARIETY IS NOW SUBJECT TO TAX
c0wc0208 AND THE LOWERING OF TAX BRACKETS MEANS THAT THE SHELTER FEATURE IS LESS CRUCIAL THAN IT ONCE WAS
c0wc0209 THE BROADCASTING PROPERTIES HAVE LONG BEEN REGARDED AS GENCORP'S BEST DEFENSE AGAINST A HOSTILE TAKEOVER
c0wc020a LICENSES FOR TWO OF THE TELEVISION STATIONS AND ALL THE RADIO STATIONS ARE BEING CHALLENGED BY GROUPS WHO CHARGE THAT GENCORP IS AN UNFIT OPERATOR
c0wc020b THE DISPUTE INCLUDES ALLEGATIONS THAT GENCORP FAILED TO ADEQUATELY INFORM THE F. C. C. OF ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND FOREIGN PAYMENTS
c0wc020c WHAT EVER GENCORP DOES IT'S GOT TO BE A MASTERPIECE A VAN GOGH
c0wc020d IF THEY DO THE WRONG THING THEY'LL END UP IN PLAY AGAIN SAYS RICHARD L. HAYDON MANAGING DIRECTOR OF BREAN MURRAY FOSTER SECURITIES
c0wc020e HE'D PREFER A DISTRIBUTION OF NINETY DOLLARS CASH PLUS TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS OF SUBORDINATED DEBT AS WELL AS SOME CONTINUING EQUITY FOR CURRENT HOLDERS
c0wc020f ENERGY EXPERTS CONSIDER AMOCO AND EXXON AMONG THE INDUSTRY'S HEALTHIEST COMPANIES FINANCIALLY WITH STRONG CREDIT RATINGS AND LOW DEBT
c0wc020g AMOCO'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHOW IT HAD FOUR HUNDRED FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES ON HAND AT THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
c0wc020h IN RECENT TALKS WITH ANALYSTS AMOCO OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THAT THE COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED FINANCIALLY IF IT DECIDES TO MAKE AN ACQUISITION
c0wc020i HE TOOK THE TAG NUMBER OF THEIR CAR MR. CLIFTON RECALLED REFERRING TO MR. MCGEE
c0wc020j AND HE CAME AND GOT ME AND SAID HEY THIS IS THE REAL THING
c0wc020k IT'S NOT A FLUKE
c0wc020l IT APPEARS TO BE TRUE
c0wc020m ISRAEL'S SHAMIR HOPES TO AVOID LOOKING LIKE THE SPOILER OF PEACE PROSPECTS BY FLOATING A REGIONAL PEACE CONFERENCE PLAN INVOLVING ONLY ISRAEL AND ARAB STATES
c0wc020n HE BILLS IT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO RIVAL PERES'S PLAN FOR AN INTERNATIONAL MEETING LEADING TO ISRAEL JORDAN TALKS
c0wc020o BUT JORDAN AND THE PALESTINIANS BOTH FIND SHAMIR'S PLAN UNACCEPTABLE
c0wc020p THE SENATE APPROVED A NINE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL FOR FISCAL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WHICH WAS AMENDED TO REQUIRE IMMIGRANTS TO UNDERGO AIDS TESTING
c0wc020q IT WAS PASSED SEVENTY ONE TO TWENTY THREE
c0wc020r THE AMENDMENT WAS THE FIRST CONGRESSIONAL BACKING FOR MANDATORY SCREENING FOR THE DISEASE
c0wc020s PRODUCERS HOWEVER SAY THE GUILD DEMAND REALLY REPRESENTS AN EFFORT TO SQUEEZE IN MORE THAN ONE SESSION A DAY
c0wc020t THE ACTORS ARE PAID BY THE SESSION NOT BY THE HOUR AND BOTH SIDES AGREE THAT SESSIONS RARELY EXCEED THREE HOURS
c0wc020u AND WITH THE GUILD CHOOSING SUCH A CRITICAL TIME FOR THE STRIKE T. V. PRODUCTION OFFICIALS ARE ESPECIALLY IRATE
c0wc020v IN TOKYO THE NIKKEI STOCK AVERAGE DECLINED THREE HUNDRED FORTY THREE POINT SIX SEVEN POINTS TO TWENTY THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO POINT FOUR TWO

c0wc020y THE STRIKE WAS CALLED TO PRESS DEMANDS FOR A THIRTY PERCENT WAGE INCREASE ADDITIONAL HOME LEAVE AND DANGER PAY
c0wc020z BUT MR. RAMAPHOSA SAID THE STRIKE ALSO WAS A CRUCIAL TEST OF STRENGTH BETWEEN THE WHITE MINE OWNERS AND HIS BLACK UNION
c0wc0210 HE SAID IT WAS UP TO THE CHAMBER OF MINES TO MAKE THE NEXT MOVE
c0wc0211 BUT EVEN INVESTORS WHO DO ALL THE HOMEWORK AND REQUEST ALL THE DOCUMENTS SHOULDN'T FEEL TOO COMPLACENT
c0wc0212 THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MUST BE UPDATED EVERY YEAR SO NEW PROSPECTUSES ARE ISSUED ANNUALLY
c0wc0213 SOMETIMES ONLY THE PERSHARE DATA TABLE CHANGES BUT OFTEN OTHER REVISIONS ARE INCLUDED

c0wc0218 VOLUME WAS SIX HUNDRED NINETY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES COMPARED WITH FIVE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION WEDNESDAY
c0wc0219 SECURITIES ANALYSTS HOWEVER REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT BASIC LOAN DEMAND
c0wc021a BRENT ERENSEL OF DEAN WITTER REYNOLDS INCORPORATED NOTED LENDING VOLUME GENERALLY ISN'T ROBUST
c0wc021b MARGINS ARE DOWN BECAUSE OF THE NEW TAX LAW AND THE SUSPENSION OF INTEREST PAYMENTS BY BRAZIL

c0yc022b HIGHER COMMISSIONS CAN ALSO REDUCE THE INVESTMENT VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES THAT INCLUDE A SAVINGS COMPONENT SUCH AS UNIVERSAL LIFE POLICIES
c0yc022c IN GENERAL POLICIES WITH HIGHER COMMISSIONS HAVE LOWER SURRENDER VALUES
c0yc022d THAT'S WHAT POLICYHOLDERS GET IF THEY CASH IN THE POLICY OR WHAT THEY CAN BORROW THROUGH POLICY LOANS

c0zc0211 CITICORP AND MORGAN TEND TO HAVE MORE VOLATILITY ON DAYS WHEN PROGRAM TRADING IS KNOWN TO OCCUR MR. SOIFER SAYS
c0zc0212 THEY'RE MORE OF A BET ON WHICH WAY THE MARKET IS HEADED
