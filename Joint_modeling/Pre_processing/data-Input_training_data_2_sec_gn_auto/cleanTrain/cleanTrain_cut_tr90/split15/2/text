c06c022i THAT'S HIS SPECIALTY TEACHING CANDIDATES HOW TO PERFORM ON T. V. COACHING POLITICIANS FOR DEBATES IS A SPECIALTY WITHIN A SPECIALTY
c06c022j AS A COACH SAYS BOB GOODMAN OF BALTIMORE ANOTHER MEDIA CONSULTANT ROGER AILES IS IN A CLASS BY HIMSELF
c06c022k I SEND MY OWN CLIENTS TO HIM
c06c022l TO BE SURE ON A LOT OF SCORES THE SUMMIT WAS A SUCCESS
c06c022m ECONOMIC COOPERATION WAS ADVANCED WITH BUSINESSMEN SIGNING AGREEMENTS FOR ABOUT THIRTY CONTRACTS AND SEVERAL JOINT VENTURES
c06c022n HUMAN RIGHTS TOO MAY HAVE TAKEN A STEP FORWARD IF MR. GORBACHEV LIVES UP TO HIS PROMISE TO RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS BY YEAR'S END
c06c022o POLAND'S OPPOSITION KNOWN TO THE WORLD AS SOLIDARITY SPEAKS UP LOUDLY FOR DEMOCRACY
c06c022p LECH WALESA WHO INSPIRES IT HAS EVEN FORCED THE POLISH AUTHORITIES LATELY TO CONSIDER LISTENING TO WHAT HE HAS TO SAY
c06c022q BUT POLAND HAS ANOTHER OPPOSITION ONE DOESN'T HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT
c06c022r HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
c06c022s TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
c06c022t THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
c07c0201 BEFORE BEING HALTED ON THE TORONTO STOCK EXCHANGE MONDAY THE VOTING SHARES TRADED AT FORTY ONE DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS
c07c0202 THE SHARES RESUMED TRADING YESTERDAY
c07c0203 THE VOTING SHARES CLOSED AT SEVENTY DOLLARS UP TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS
c07c0204 THE CLASS A SHARES CLOSED AT FOURTEEN POINT THREE SEVEN FIVE DOLLARS UP SIXTY SEVEN POINT FIVE CENTS
c07c0205 THE NIGHT BEFORE HE HAD WORKED UNTIL THREE A. M. FILLING THE ROOM WITH HIS EQUIPMENT
c07c0206 BUT AS HIS MORNING CLASS STARTS HE IS BUBBLING
c07c0207 COMPUTERS ARE VERY ADDICTIVE
c07c0208 THEY'RE LIKE DRUGS HE PROMISES
c07c0209 MR. JACOBS HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS TO LEAVE ON FEBRUARY FIRST TO FORM A NEW FIRM WITH ANOTHER PARTNER JOHN F. GERARD
c07c020a SEVERAL STAFF MEMBERS PLAN TO LEAVE WITH HIM
c07c020b MR. JACOBS SAID HIS DEPARTURE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FIRM'S PROBLEMS
c07c020c I'M NOT A BIG FIRM KIND OF GUY HE SAID
c07c020d I DON'T WANT TO LIVE BY CONSENSUS
c07c020e THE ACCORD MOST LIKELY WOULD INCLUDE SOME PRIVATE AGREEMENT AMONG MINISTERS ON HOW FAR UP OR DOWN THESE RATES CAN MOVE AND STILL BE ACCEPTABLE
c07c020f BUT OFFICIALS SAID IT IS UNLIKELY THESE LIMITS WOULD BE MADE PUBLIC
c07c020g AND IT ISN'T KNOWN YET WHETHER THE MAJOR POWERS WOULD PLEDGE TO INTERVENE IN CURRENCY MARKETS IF EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO EXCEED THOSE LIMITS
c07c020h AS MODEST AS THE MEASURES ARE EVEN THEY WON'T BE ADOPTED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
c07c020i THE TAX CUTS ACCEPTED BY THE COALITION PARTIES HAVE BEEN LINKED TO CUTBACKS IN FEDERAL SUBSIDIES
c07c020j SUCH REDUCTIONS COULD RILE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS AND UNDERMINE PARLIAMENTARY SUPPORT FOR THE ENTIRE TAX PROGRAM
c07c020k MOREOVER ANY TAX REFORM MUST CLEAR PARLIAMENT'S UPPER HOUSE THE BUNDESRAT WHERE THE RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION CLINGS TO A MAJORITY
c07c020l TRADING VOLUME HAS BEEN LETHARGIC FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS PARTLY REFLECTING CONFUSION ABOUT THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
c07c020m IMPORTANT CLUES ARE EXPECTED TO EMERGE FRIDAY WHEN THE LABOR DEPARTMENT REPORTS EMPLOYMENT FIGURES FOR FEBRUARY
c07c020n MANY ANALYSTS EXPECT THE STATISTICS TO INDICATE THAT THE ECONOMY REMAINS WEAK AND THAT LOWER INTEREST RATES LIE AHEAD
c07c020o BUT THE EMPLOYMENT STATISTICS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND INDIVIDUAL ESTIMATES VARY WIDELY
c07c020p CLEVELAND CONFRONTED SCANDALS SWIFTLY AND WITH UNCOMMON CANDOR CONCEDING FROM THE OUTSET FOR EXAMPLE HIS AFFAIR WITH MARIA HALPIN ONCE IT WAS EXPOSED
c07c020q YET HE WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO CONCEAL HIS CANCER SURGERY
c07c020r MR. REAGAN ON THE OTHER HAND EXPOSED HIS MALIGNANT BOWELS TO THE NATION BUT ONLY GRUDGINGLY TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE IRAN CONTRA FIASCO
c07c020s FLOATING FAILS WHEN GOVERNMENTS TRY TO ESCAPE FROM THE VERDICT OF THE EXCHANGE MARKETS ON THEIR POLICIES BY RESORTING TO DIRECT CONTROLS OVER TRADE AND CAPITAL FLOWS
c07c020w THE STORY GETTING INTO THE SET THOUGH COMIC IN TONE IS ABOUT A WOMAN SELLING HER SOUL FOR THE WORLD
c07c020x IT IS HILARIOUS AND PAINFUL ESPECIALLY THE KICKER AT THE END AND IT IS THE ONLY STORY HERE THAT DOES NOT READ LIKE NEWS FROM THE NEXT COUNTY
c07c020z RENT CONTROL REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF LOW COST HOUSING AND EVEN IN PLACES SUCH AS NEW YORK CITY PRICES EVEN MIDDLE CLASS RENTERS OUT OF THE MARKET
c07c0210 BUT TWO WRONGS DO NOT MAKE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT
c07c0211 NEXT TERM THE SUPREME COURT WILL RULE ON A SAN JOSE RENT CONTROL LAW THAT FORCES LANDLORDS TO CHARGE LESS RENT TO LOWER INCOME TENANTS
c07c0212 A FREER PROPERTY MARKET WILL EXPAND NOT CONTRACT HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE POOR
c07c0213 PRESIDENT HUSSEIN'S DOMESTIC STRATEGY AIMED AT SAVING HIS OWN SKIN HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLY MORE SUCCESSFUL
c07c0216 IN THE MILITARY OR IN ANY APPOINTED LEADERSHIP POSITION YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY BY THE JOB YOU HOLD HE SAYS
c07c0217 IN POLITICS WHETHER YOU'RE RUNNING FOR OFFICE SEEKING A CLAIM OR APPROBATION YOU'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHOM YOU WOULDN'T TOLERATE FOR THIRTY SECONDS
c07c0218 YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO TOLERATE FOOLS
c07c0219 THE ANNOUNCEMENT WOULD CAP A HIGHLY PUBLICIZED SEARCH FOR A POSSIBLE NEW HOME
c07c021a IT ALSO WOULD REPRESENT A MAJOR VICTORY FOR NEW YORK CITY WHICH HAS BEEN FIGHTING TO KEEP COMPANIES FROM FLEEING THE CITY
c07c021b N. B. C. HAD BEEN CONSIDERING MOVING SOME OR ALL OF ITS FACILITIES TO NEW JERSEY
c07c021c WE WANT MORE INSTITUTIONAL ASSETS SAYS A KEMPER SPOKESWOMAN
c07c021d WE THINK THE BUSINESS HOLDS CONSIDERABLE PROMISE FOR THE FUTURE SHE ADDS AND WE THINK CITICORP IS A CAPABLE ORGANIZATION
c07c021f FIRST BOSTON AND XEROX HAD NO COMMENT
c07c021g DRAWING ON HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF DAYS OF METICULOUS OBSERVATION MS. MOSS INTRODUCES HER DISCUSSIONS OF ONE SUBJECT OR ANOTHER WITH TRUE STORIES BUILT ON REAL EXPERIENCE
c07c021h SOMETIMES THE NARRATIVE IS CLEARLY STRAIGHT FIRSTHAND REPORTAGE
c07c021i OTHER TIMES IT IS A COMPOSITE RENDERING OR AN IMAGINATIVE RECONSTRUCTION
c07c021j MR. TANAKA WAS ONE OF THE FIRST SCIENTISTS TO RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL OF SUPERCONDUCTORS WHICH ARE SUBSTANCES THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRICITY WITH NO RESISTANCE AND THUS NO LOSS OF POWER
c07c021k IF MADE PRACTICAL THEY COULD BRING SPECTACULAR CHANGES TO ALMOST ANY ELECTRICAL PRODUCT OR PROCESS
c07c021l THAT COULD MEAN VASTLY FASTER AND MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS SUCH AS COMPUTERS CARS AND HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES
c07c021m BUT UNTIL THE RECENT BREAKTHROUGH SUPERCONDUCTORS HAD TO BE CHILLED TO A HOPELESSLY LOW TEMPERATURE TO WORK SO EXCEPT FOR A FEW APPLICATIONS THERE REALLY WAS NO TECHNOLOGY
c07c021n ANOTHER POTENTIAL POINT OF CONTENTION IS THE E. C.'S PLAN TO ALLOW THE FREE FLOW OF PEOPLE ACROSS BORDERS
c07c021o SWITZERLAND ALREADY HAS ATTRACTED ONE MILLION RESIDENT ALIENS A PORTION OF ITS POPULATION GREATER THAN IN ANY E. C. STATE EXCEPT LUXEMBOURG
c07c021p MOST SWISS THINK THAT THAT IS ENOUGH AND THE COUNTRY HAS IMPOSED FOREIGN WORKER QUOTAS SO STRICT THAT SKILLED LABOR IS IN SHORT SUPPLY
c07c021q YET IF SWITZERLAND CLOSES ITS DOORS TO MORE E. C. NATIONALS SWISS WHO WORK IN THE E. C. MAY FIND THEMSELVES LESS WELCOME
c07c021r MR. HARMON ESTIMATES THAT BETWEEN TEN PERCENT AND FIFTEEN PERCENT OF ZAYRE'S THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT STORES WILL BE CLOSED IN THE REVAMPING
c07c021s MANY MORE STORES WILL BE REMODELED
c07c021t THE EFFORT WILL PARALLEL ONE ALREADY UNDER WAY AT ZAYRE
c07c021u THEIR PLAN IS THE RIGHT PLAN MR. HARMON SAID
c07c021v BUT IT WOULD HAVE MEANT A LOT OF EXPENSES AND A LOT OF LOSSES FOR A COMPANY ALREADY RACKED WITH LOSSES
c07c021w I DOUBT THAT I OR ANY OTHER AMERICAN WILL EVER AGAIN SEE TAX RATES AS LOW AS THEY ARE NOW MR. SIMMONS SAID
c07c021x SO HE SOLD ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SHARES HE ACQUIRED EARLIER THIS YEAR BY EXERCISING AN OPTION
c07c021y ABOUT HALF THE PROCEEDS WILL GO TO PAY TAX ON THE GAIN HE SAID
c07c021z THAT'S WHAT WALL COVERING INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES DO
c07c0220 LAST WEEKEND AT AN INDUSTRY GATHERING HERE NEARLY FIFTY OF THEM DRESSED UP IN FABRICS DESIGNED FOR BEDROOM BATHROOM AND OTHER HOUSEHOLD WALLS
c07c0221 THEN AFTER A FEW ROUNDS OF DRINKS THEY STAGED A FASHION SHOW FOR HUNDREDS OF GUESTS
c07c0222 THE TREASURY IS SCHEDULED TO ANNOUNCE DETAILS OF ITS QUARTERLY FINANCING OPERATION NOVEMBER SECOND
c07c0223 IT USUALLY CONSISTS OF THREE YEAR NOTES TEN YEAR NOTES AND THIRTY YEAR BONDS
c07c0224 BUT THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY CLOSE TO REACHING ITS LIMITS ON ISSUING LONG TERM DEBT AND THUS HAS ASKED CONGRESS TO INCREASE ITS AUTHORITY
c07c0225 CONGRESS STILL HASN'T COMPLETED WORK ON THE ISSUE WHICH IS PART OF THE TAX BILL PASSED LATE TUESDAY BY THE SENATE
c07c0226 THE REHABILITATION PROCESS IS CERTAINLY FURTHER ALONG
c07c0227 THERE'S LESS LOOKING BACK AND MORE LOOKING FORWARD NOW MR. LEFEVRE SAID
c07c0228 PEOPLE ARE FOCUSING MORE ON THE ELECTION AND THE POST ELECTION PERIOD WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN FOR THE ECONOMY
c07c0229 BUT AFTER FIVE YEARS OF DECLINE UNIT LABOR COSTS HAVE BEGUN TO EDGE UP AMONG MANUFACTURERS
c07c022a WAGES AND BENEFITS THIS YEAR HAVE BEEN RISING AT NEARLY DOUBLE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN'S TWO POINT ONE PERCENT RATE SLIGHTLY EXCEEDING THE GAIN IN PRODUCTIVITY
c07c022b AS A RESULT MANUFACTURERS' UNIT LABOR COSTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER CREPT UP ZERO POINT SEVEN PERCENT FROM A YEAR EARLIER THE LABOR DEPARTMENT REPORTED YESTERDAY
c07c022c MR. JORDAN WAS AWARDED DAMAGES OF NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS AND A PUNITIVE AWARD OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
c07c022d THE JURY ALSO FOUND THAT CLAYTON UNDER MISSOURI COMMON LAW HAD BREACHED ITS FIDUCIARY DUTIES BECAUSE OF SELF DEALING
c07c022e THE APPEALS COURT UPHELD THE LOWER COURT IN OCTOBER NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
c07c022f ISRAELI SOLDIERS BLOCKED ABOUT ONE THOUSAND PALESTINIANS FROM ENTERING ISRAEL IN A TEST OF NEW IDENTIFICATION CARDS
c07c022g BEGINNING TODAY ARABS CAN'T LEAVE THE OCCUPIED GAZA STRIP WITHOUT THE MAGNETIZED PLASTIC CARDS
c07c022h THE MOVE HAS INTENSIFIED THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN ISRAELI AUTHORITIES AND PALESTINIAN LEADERS
c08c0201 TO CURB DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION AND SALVAGE THE TRADE SURPLUS BRAZIL'S ECONOMIC PLANNERS RECENTLY IMPOSED A TOUGH PACKAGE OF TAX AND PRICE INCREASES
c08c0202 THE RESULT BRAZILIANS LAST WEEK RIOTED IN THE STREETS OF BRASILIA IN THE WORST VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL IN ITS TWENTY SIX YEAR HISTORY
c08c0203 AND A GENERAL STRIKE HAS BEEN TENTATIVELY SET FOR DECEMBER TWELFTH
c08c0204 SPECULATION HEATS UP ON VOLCKER'S FUTURE
c08c0207 BUYING CORPORATE ZEROS FOR AN I. R. A. NEUTRALIZES THEIR MOST OBVIOUS DISADVANTAGE THE TAX TREATMENT
c08c0208 WITH RARE EXCEPTIONS SUCH BONDS TRIGGER PERSONAL INCOME TAX EACH YEAR ON THE THEORETICAL ACCUMULATION OR ACCRETION OF INTEREST
c08c0209 THAT MEANS INVESTORS PAY TAX ON MONEY THEY HAVEN'T YET RECEIVED
c08c020a IF THE BONDS ARE BOUGHT FOR AN I. R. A. HOWEVER NO TAX IS DUE UNTIL THE MONEY IS WITHDRAWN
c08c020c DEMOCRATIC SENATOR HEFLIN BLUNDERS BY PREMATURELY DISCUSSING INDICTMENTS
c08c020e HIS FIRST TEST ON THAT ISSUE WILL BE WHETHER HE CAN PERSUADE THE OPPOSITION TO FIELD A CANDIDATE AGAINST HIM
c08c020f THE CHIEF OPPOSITION PARTY THE REUNIFICATION AND DEMOCRACY PARTY LED BY KIM YOUNG SAM HAS VOWED IT WON'T PARTICIPATE IN ANY ELECTION UNDER THE CURRENT CONSTITUTION
c08c020g IT AND THE NATIONAL COALITION FOR A DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTION A NEWLY FORMED ALLIANCE OF RELIGIOUS AND DISSIDENT GROUPS ARE ORGANIZING TOMORROW'S OPPOSITION RALLIES
c08c020h THOSE CREDITORS INCLUDE MULTILATERAL AGENCIES LATIN AMERICAN AND SOME EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS AND SHORT TERM COMMERCIAL BANK CREDITORS AND SUPPLIERS
c08c020i PERU RECENTLY RESUMED DEBT PAYMENTS TO THE INTER AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
c08c020j BUT THERE AREN'T ANY CURRENT PLANS TO RESUME PAYMENTS TO THE WORLD BANK OR THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE ADVISER SAID
c08c020k SHARON'S BOARD FOUGHT THE ACQUISITION VIGOROUSLY TO NO AVAIL
c08c020l EVENTUALLY SHARON SHAREHOLDERS TENDERED EIGHTY SIX PERCENT OF THEIR SHARES GIVING N. V. F. CONTROL
c08c020m AT THE FIRST BOARD MEETING UNDER MR. POSNER SIX DIRECTORS RESIGNED
c08c020n AN EMBITTERED MONSIEUR PERRAULT LEFT THREE MONTHS LATER
c08c020o DUKE POWER COMPANY CHARLOTTE N. C. CONSIDERED ONE OF THE NATION'S MOST EFFICIENT NUCLEAR OPERATORS SAYS IT'S INTERESTED IN RESTARTING AND RUNNING RANCHO SECO
c08c020p THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST TIME ONE UTILITY ACQUIRED OPERATING RESPONSIBILITY FOR AN ENTIRE NUCLEAR PLANT LONG RUN BY ANOTHER UTILITY
c08c020q IT OPENS THE POSSIBILITY THAT MORE SUCH MOVES COULD OCCUR IN THE FUTURE
c08c020r WHAT'S MORE A FURTHER DROP IN THE DOLLAR COULD HAVE THE VERY RESULT MR. BAKER SEEKS TO AVOID HIGHER INTEREST RATES
c08c020s IN ORDER TO KEEP PERSUADING FOREIGN INVESTORS TO HOLD CHEAPER DOLLARS THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST KEEP U. S. INTEREST RATES HIGHER THAN THOSE ABROAD
c08c020t AN EVEN WEAKER DOLLAR COULD REQUIRE HIGHER RATES
c08c020u IDEALLY A CAMPAIGN'S FREE MEDIA AND PAID MEDIA MESH SEAMLESSLY ONE REINFORCING THE OTHER
c08c020v PRESIDENT REAGAN'S NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR REELECTION EFFORT MAY HAVE SET A NEW STANDARD IN THIS REGARD
c08c020w RALLIES WERE METICULOUSLY STAGED TO REINFORCE THE CAMPAIGN'S MESSAGE OF PATRIOTISM AND OPTIMISM
c08c020x THE RESULT WAS NEWS FOOTAGE THAT LOOKED LIKE THE CAMPAIGN'S COMMERCIALS
c08c020y MR. EISNER ALSO ENJOYED A FIFTY SIX POINT NINE MILLION DOLLAR PAPER PROFIT ON OPTIONS HE HOLDS ON STOCK OF THE BURBANK CALIFORNIA ENTERTAINMENT CONCERN
c08c020z HE IS CURRENTLY ENTITLED TO BUY ABOUT ONE POINT TWO MILLION DISNEY COMMON SHARES AT ABOUT FOURTEEN DOLLARS THIRTY SIX CENTS A SHARE
c08c0210 WHEN HIS SIX YEAR EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT EXPIRES IN NINETEEN NINETY MR. EISNER WILL HAVE ACQUIRED OPTIONS TO PURCHASE TWO MILLION SHARES
c08c0211 IN NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING YESTERDAY DISNEY STOCK CLOSED AT SIXTY POINT EIGHT SEVEN FIVE DOLLARS UP THIRTY SEVEN POINT FIVE CENTS
c08c0212 INVESTORS REACTED FAVORABLY TO THE PROPOSED COMBINATION
c08c0213 IN NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING YESTERDAY BELLSOUTH'S STOCK ROSE SEVENTY FIVE CENTS TO CLOSE AT THIRTY NINE POINT SIX TWO FIVE DOLLARS
c08c0214 IN NATIONAL OVER THE COUNTER TRADING MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS' CLASS B. SHARES ROSE TO TWENTY THREE DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS UP THREE DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS
c08c0215 KAISER'S PRESENT VALUE IS EQUALLY UNCERTAIN THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT ITS NET WORTH IS AT LEAST A NEGATIVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
c08c0216 IN ITS LAWSUITS AGAINST FORMER MANAGEMENT THE COMPANY IS SEEKING DAMAGES OF MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR ALLEGED SELF DEALING AND MISMANAGEMENT
c08c0217 IN THE PROCESS THE SUITS ALLEGE ASSETS WERE OVERSTATED AND LIABILITIES UNDERSTATED
c08c0218 DOW PRESIDENT FRANK POPOFF SAID IN A STATEMENT THAT BOTH PRICE AND VOLUME INCREASES BOLSTERED EARNINGS
c08c0219 THE COMPANY'S STRONG COST CONTAINMENT EFFORTS ALSO HELPED
c08c021a COSTS REMAIN STABLE VOLUME HAS INCREASED AND THERE IS NO WEAKNESS APPARENT IN EITHER THE PRODUCT LINES OR GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS MR. POPOFF SAID
c08c021b FRENCH PRESIDENT MITTERRAND NAMED A LONGTIME SOCIALIST RIVAL MICHEL ROCARD AS PRIME MINISTER
c08c021c THE FORMER AGRICULTURE MINISTER KNOWN FOR HIS FREE MARKET VIEWS SUCCEEDS JACQUES CHIRAC WHO RESIGNED FOLLOWING HIS DEFEAT IN PRESIDENTIAL BALLOTING
c08c021d MITTERRAND IS SEEKING TO REALIGN FRANCE AROUND THE CENTER LEFT
c08c021e ALL THIS REFLECTS A MOOD OF TRANSITION AND UNCERTAINTY THAT HAS GRIPPED BRITAIN'S PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED THEATER IN RECENT YEARS
c08c021f FRETTING ABOUT FINANCES MOST COMPANIES ARE TAKING FEWER CREATIVE RISKS
c08c021g AUDIENCES IN TURN HAVE GROWN MORE CONSERVATIVE
c08c021h YET THERE'S MORE WORK PERFORMED NOW THAN IN YEARS MAINLY TO KEEP REVENUES FLOWING
c08c021i BUT AS THE DIRECT MAIL FIELD GROWS MORE CROWDED COMPANIES MUST BE CLEVER TO CUT THROUGH THE CLUTTER
c08c021k MERRILL LYNCH AND COMPANY SAYS IT GETS FIVE TIMES AS MANY RESPONSE CALLS WHEN ITS MAIL LOOKS URGENT LIKE A TELEGRAM
c08c021l HOUSEHOLD FINANCE COMPANY A UNIT OF HOUSEHOLD INTERNATIONAL COMPANY EXPERIMENTS WITH DIFFERENT COLORED ENVELOPES AND SNAZZY TEASER COPY TO GET CONSUMERS TO OPEN ITS MAILINGS

c08c021o RECREATION RELATED BUSINESSES SUCH AS MOVIE THEATERS AND BOWLING ALLEYS ALSO ARE EXEMPT
c08c021p THE PURPOSE OF THE BAN IS TO KEEP DOWN TRAFFIC THE TOWN SAYS
c08c021q E. C. OFFICIALS ARGUE THAT INCREASED CROSSBORDER MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS IN EUROPE HAVE MADE ANTITRUST ISSUES MORE THAN A NATIONAL AFFAIR
c08c021r IN THE IRISH DISTILLERS BID NO SINGLE GOVERNMENT WAS IN A POSITION TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE EUROPEAN WHISKEY MARKET
c08c021s E. C. OFFICIALS SAY WHISKEY PRICES WOULD HAVE RISEN THROUGHOUT THE E. C.
c08c021t NOT SINCE THE NINETEEN THIRTIES HAVE CITIZENS PLACED SO MANY INITIATIVES ON STATE BALLOTS
c08c021u MORE THAN SIXTY BALLOT MEASURES RANGING FROM OPEN PIT MINING TO GOVERNMENT ETHICS TO PAROLE REFORM WILL CONFRONT VOTERS IN MORE THAN HALF THE STATES
c08c021v WHY THE EXPLOSION IN DIRECT DEMOCRACY
c08c021w A BIG REASON WE SUSPECT IS THAT LEGISLATURES ARE INCREASINGLY UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO DEAL WITH ISSUES THAT VOTERS CONSIDER IMPORTANT
c08c021x SUCH PLANS MAKE EDUCATORS CRINGE
c08c021y THEY WORRY THAT A COLLEGE DEGREE COULD BE REDUCED TO A FEW TRIPS TO THE NOTES SUPERMARKET
c08c0220 THE GOVERNMENT SOURCE WHO REQUESTED ANONYMITY SAID THE MEASURE WOULD ALLOW FOR THE CONFISCATION OF FUNDS IN ADDITION TO FINES AND IMPRISONMENT
c08c0221 LOCAL PRESS REPORTS SAID FINES OF UP TO FIFTY MILLION LUXEMBOURG FRANCS ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND PRISON TERMS OF UP TO FIVE YEARS COULD BE IMPOSED
c08c0222 THE PROPOSED LAW IS EXPECTED TO GAIN PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL AND GO INTO EFFECT NEXT YEAR
c08c0223 NOW QUICK RECOGNITION OF LOSSES IS NOT ONLY GOOD INVESTMENT STRATEGY BUT GOOD ECONOMIC STRATEGY
c08c0224 FULL DEDUCTIBILITY WOULD PROMOTE MOBILITY OF CAPITAL AND EFFICIENT PRICING OF ASSETS
c08c0225 IT WOULD OBVIOUSLY PROMOTE MORE VENTURE CAPITAL WITH HIGH GAINS AND HIGH RISKS
c08c0226 MERE INDEXING BY CONTRAST WOULD HELP THE BIG AND DULL INVESTMENTS WITH LOW RISKS AND HUMDRUM REWARDS
c08c0227 BUT IF FULL DEDUCTIBILITY OF LOSSES WOULD BE GOOD FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH IT WOULD BE BAD IN TWO OTHER WAYS
c08c0228 BUT THE LAWMAKERS ACTUALLY SPENT ONLY ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF THE MONEY AUTHORIZED UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF THIS FISCAL YEAR
c08c0229 AND SO FAR HARDLY ANY OF THE PROMISED ADDITIONAL TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN FORTHCOMING
c08c022a WE LOST OUR BILL CONCEDES SENATOR MOYNIHAN A NEW YORK DEMOCRAT
c08c022b ONE STUMBLING BLOCK TO INCREASED COMPETITION IS THE VERTICAL INTEGRATION AND CROSS OWNERSHIP IN THE INDUSTRY
c08c022c CABLE SYSTEMS OFTEN HAVE DEMANDED A STAKE IN THE CHANNELS THEY TRANSMIT
c08c022d AN ENTREPRENEUR IS RELUCTANT TO START AN ALTERNATIVE CABLE SYSTEM IF HE KNOWS THAT HE WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GAIN ACCESS TO PROGRAMMING
c08c022e QUITE POSSIBLY SOME OF THE ANTITRUST ASPECTS OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS DESERVE A LOOK SO IT CAN BE DETERMINED WHETHER THEY ACT TO FURTHER INHIBIT COMPETITION IN THE INDUSTRY
c08c022f PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE SITUATION SAY THE COMPANY AND PILOTS' UNION WERE HOPING TO HAMMER OUT AN AGREEMENT THAT THE OTHER LABOR GROUPS WOULD FIND ACCEPTABLE
c08c022g BUT MR. SCHROEDER'S LETTER SAID THE MACHINISTS WILL NEITHER ACCEPT A FAIT ACCOMPLI NOR BE STAMPEDED INTO UNNECESSARY OR IMPRUDENT ACTION
c08c022h HE ALSO SAID THE MACHINISTS' UNION WILL OPPOSE ANY TRANSACTION THAT DOESN'T GUARANTEE JOB PROTECTION FOR ITS MEMBERS
c09c0201 THE MARKET WAS AIDED BY THE WEEKEND ACCORD BY THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES TO CUT PRODUCTION AND SELL OIL AT FIXED PRICES
c09c0202 EXPECTATIONS THAT OIL PRICES WILL INCREASE BUOYED OIL SHARES
c09c0203 MOREOVER BRITAIN IS A MAJOR OIL PRODUCER ALTHOUGH NOT A MEMBER OF OPEC AND HIGHER OIL PRICES WOULD INCREASE THE COUNTRY'S REVENUE
c09c0204 ALL THE GAINS THAT WE'RE MAKING ARE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SAYS F. JAMES MCDONALD G. M.'S PRESIDENT
c09c0205 THAT MAY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING HAPPENING IN HEAVY INDUSTRY IN THE U. S. TODAY
c09c0206 INDEED THE ERA OF BIG TIME NATIONAL LABOR TALKS IN WHICH UNION AND MANAGEMENT LEADERS BUTT HEADS OVER PENNIES AN HOUR IS WANING
c09c0207 IN HIS NEW JOB MR. DARMAN WILL REPORT TO SHERMAN R. LEWIS JUNIOR AND PETER J. SOLOMON COCHAIRMAN OF SHEARSON LEHMAN'S INVESTMENT BANKING DIVISION

c09c0209 SHEARSON LEHMAN IS A SUBSIDIARY OF NEW YORK BASED AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY
c09c020a SMOKERS ARE FEELING THE HEAT BECAUSE COMPANIES ARE TAKING A HARDER LINE ON SUCH ISSUES AS PRODUCTIVITY RISING MEDICAL COSTS AND THE EFFECTS OF PASSIVE SMOKE
c09c020b ALTHOUGH THERE ARE CONFLICTING CLAIMS ABOUT WHETHER SMOKERS COST EMPLOYERS MORE IN TERMS OF HIGHER INSURANCE RATES AND ABSENTEEISM COMPANIES OFTEN CITE SUCH CONCERNS TO JUSTIFY RESTRICTIVE SMOKING POLICIES
c09c020c <NOISE> IN ADDITION NEW STATE AND LOCAL ORDINANCES AND EMPLOYEE COMPLAINTS PUT SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON MANY COMPANIES
c09c020d ALREADY MR. GORBACHEV HAS INSTITUTED QUALITY CONTROLS AT INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES
c09c020e SINCE JANUARY FIRST A NEWLY CREATED AGENCY HAS BEEN SENDING INSPECTORS TO FACTORIES WITH THE AUTHORITY TO DECLARE GOODS TOO SHODDY FOR SALE TO THE PUBLIC

c09c020g AT MOST HIGHFLYING TEXAS THRIFTS A FRIEND OF THE BOSS COULD GET MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON A SIGNATURE
c09c020h LOANS COULD EXCEED THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE LAND THANKS TO SOME LIBERAL TEXAS S. AND L. LAWS AND COOPERATIVE APPRAISERS
c09c020i DOWN PAYMENTS WERE CONSIDERED AN UNNECESSARY FORMALITY AND NOBODY SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED CHASING AFTER A BORROWER WHO DIDN'T PAY

c09c020y ADVANCING ISSUES AND DECLINERS WERE NECK AND NECK YESTERDAY BUT THE HEAVIEST TRADING WAS AMONG THE ISSUES WITH RISING PRICES
c09c020z SOME FIFTY POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS AT ADVANCING PRICES COMPARED WITH THIRTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION THAT TRADED AT LOWER PRICES
c09c0210 IN ALL A MODERATE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION SHARES TRADED ON NASDAQ YESTERDAY
c09c0211 MR. KEATING SAID MOST OF LINCOLN'S INCREASE IN FOURTH QUARTER NET INCOME CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE BANK'S GROWTH IN ASSETS
c09c0212 AT DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST ASSETS WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED WITH TWO HUNDRED FORTY ONE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR EARLIER
c09c0214 I HAVE NO DOUBT THOUGH THAT THE THRUST OF FED POLICY WILL BE MORE TOWARD EASE THAN RESTRAINT MR. ROBERTSON ADDS
c09c0215 FED OFFICIALS WILL BE MUCH MORE INCLINED TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF EASE
c09c0216 SO I THINK THE FED FUNDS RATE WILL BE AT SIX POINT FIVE OH PERCENT TO SIX POINT SEVEN FIVE PERCENT FOR THE NEXT SIXTY DAYS
c09c0217 ASKED ABOUT THE SITUATION A FIRST BOSTON SPOKESMAN SAID OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CAMPEAU HAS NOT CHANGED

c09c021u THAT'S WHY MAGAZINE EXECUTIVES SAY COVERS HAVE TO REACH OUT AND GRAB BUYERS
c09c021v BUT SENATOR DAVID BOREN D. OKLAHOMA THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WAS LESS OPTIMISTIC
c09c021w THIS IS NO WAY TO BEGIN A RELATIONSHIP UNDER A TREATY AS IMPORTANT AS THIS IF THESE DELIBERATE AMBIGUITIES REMAIN HE TOLD REPORTERS

c09c021z THE SOVIETS HAVE A PRODIGIOUS ANTIAIRCRAFT DEFENSE AND MIGHT COPE WITH MANY OF THE G. L. C. M.S
c09c0220 FOR NOW THOUGH THE PERSHINGS CAN'T BE STOPPED
c09c0221 BUT UNDER THE I. N. F. TREATY BOTH ARE TRADED AWAY
c09c0222 NO HE'S NOT
c09c0223 TOBACCO COMPANIES HAVE THE RIGHT TO MARKET THEIR PRODUCT HE SAYS HIS VOICE RISING AND HIS PARTY MANNERS WEARING THIN
c09c0224 THEY OUGHT TO BE ACCORDED THE SAME FAIRNESS AS PEOPLE WHO SELL HOUSE PLANTS

c09c022f THE OFFICIAL ACKNOWLEDGED BUSINESS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE FREQUENCY OF GOVERNMENT CHANGES IN THE TAX LAW BUT HE DISMISSED THEM
c09c022g STABILITY IS A NICE THING HE SAID
c09c022h BUT IT'S ALWAYS TRUE THAT SYSTEMS WE HAVE IN PLACE HAVE BIASES IN THEM
c09c022i THERE'S NO REASON WE SHOULDN'T WORK ON THEM

c0ac020g THE BEST CASE IS MADE BY ELECTRIC UTILITIES THAT HAVE POWER PLANTS SERVED BY COAL HAULING ROADS BUT BIG UTILITIES DON'T LACK BARGAINING POWER
c0ac020h FOR ONE THING THE STAGGERS ACT NOW ALLOWS LONG TERM CONTRACTS BETWEEN SHIPPERS AND RAILROADS
c0ac020i THAT INCREDIBLY WAS NOT ALLOWED UNDER THE OLD LAW BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD ONCE DECIDED THAT VOLUME DISCOUNTS TO BIG SHIPPERS WERE UNFAIR
c0ac020j <NOISE> IN DRAWING UP CONTRACTS THE RELEVANT FACT IS THAT BOTH THE RAILROAD AND THE UTILITY NEED EACH OTHER
c0ac020k SOME UTILITIES PARTICULARLY IN THE WEST HAVE SURPLUS CAPACITY MEANING THEY CAN SWITCH TO OTHER SOURCES IF HAULING COSTS AT A SINGLE PLANT RISE
c0ac020l <NOISE> MR. MCNAY HAS DEVELOPED A REPUTATION AS AN INDEPENDENT NO NONSENSE BUYER OF SMALL COMPANY STOCKS

c0ac021i AT FIRST F. D. I. C. OFFICIALS SUGGESTED THAT WOULD LEAVE CREDITORS EMPTY HANDED
c0ac021j BUT THAT CAME TO LOOK UNLIKELY AS FIRST CITY HAD SOME HEALTHY BANKS AND REGULATORS CAN CLOSE ONLY INSOLVENT BANKS
c0ac021k IF THEY HAD TAKEN OVER THE SICK BANKS CREDITORS MANY OF THEM ARBITRAGERS WHO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PROFIT COULD HAVE PURSUED CLAIMS AGAINST THE SOLVENT ONES
c0ac021l IN AFGHANISTAN HE ADDS PEOPLE HAVE STAYED IN THE ARMY BECAUSE THEY NEED TO FEED THEIR CHILDREN AND BECAUSE THEY WORRY ABOUT THEIR FAMILIES
c0ac021m THEY JOIN OFFENSIVES BECAUSE THE SOVIETS ARE AT THEIR BACKS WITH GUNS

c0ac0228 SOME ANALYSTS SAID MANAGEMENT MIGHT ARRANGE A LEVERAGED BUY OUT OF ITS OWN
c0ac0229 <NOISE> BUT OTHERS VIEWED THAT OPTION AS LEAST LIKELY BECAUSE WEST POINT ALREADY HAS ALMOST ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT FROM THE STEVENS ACQUISITION
