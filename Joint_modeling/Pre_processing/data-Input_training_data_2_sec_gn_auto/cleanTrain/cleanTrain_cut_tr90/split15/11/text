c1mc020h THESE CRITICISMS ARE OVERWROUGHT AND UNCONVINCING
c1mc020i WHILE PRIVATE OPERATORS WILL CERTAINLY LOBBY IN THEIR OWN INTEREST IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT THEY COULD MANIPULATE PUBLIC OPINION AND LAWMAKERS AS EASILY AS THEIR OPPONENTS SUGGEST

c1mc020m BECAUSE THIS LATTER THREAT IS NOW SO SEVERE THE WORLD IS RIGHT TO TALK ABOUT INTERNATIONAL MONETARY REFORM IF ONLY AS A DELAYING GAME
c1mc020n BUT IDEALISTIC TALK SHOULD NOT DECEIVE STABILIZING EXCHANGE RATES REQUIRES DEPENDENCE AND SUBORDINATION NOT THE FREEDOM FOR EVERYBODY TO DO THEIR OWN THING

c1mc020x FORD FOR INSTANCE HAS INDICATED IT IS LOOKING FOR ACQUISITIONS AND HAS ACCUMULATED ABOUT NINE BILLION DOLLARS IT COULD USE FOR SUCH PURPOSES

c1mc021i SENATOR BENTSEN'S CORPORATE TAX PROPOSAL WOULD REPLACE A PROVISION IN THE COMMITTEE BILL ALLOWING THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE TO WITHHOLD REFUNDS FROM TAXPAYERS WHO HAVE DEFAULTED ON GOVERNMENT LOANS

c1nc0201 TO CURB DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION AND SALVAGE THE TRADE SURPLUS BRAZIL'S ECONOMIC PLANNERS RECENTLY IMPOSED A TOUGH PACKAGE OF TAX AND PRICE INCREASES
c1nc0202 THE RESULT BRAZILIANS LAST WEEK RIOTED IN THE STREETS OF BRASILIA IN THE WORST VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL IN ITS TWENTY SIX YEAR HISTORY

c1nc0204 EDWARD YARDENI CHIEF ECONOMIST AT PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES INCORPORATED IN NEW YORK SAID THE SURPRISING SURGE IN NONRESIDENTIAL BUILDING IS A REASON FOR CONCERN

c1nc020q LIEUTENANT COLONEL OLLIE NORTH WAS SWORN IN AND BRENDAN SULLIVAN JUNIOR HIS LAWYER PROMPTLY SET OUT TO PROVE THAT WITNESSES CAN TALK BACK AT A CONGRESSIONAL HEARING

c1nc020s THE ARBITRATORS DECLINE TO DISCUSS THE SPECIFICS OF THE CASE
c1nc020t MR. STEVENSON SAYS ONLY THAT ARBITRATION IS A NARROWLY FOCUSED EVENT
c1nc020u THE ARBITRATORS HAVE TO STAY WITHIN THE BOUNDARY OF WHAT'S BEING PRESENTED TO THEM
c1nc020v BOSTON BASED FIDELITY THIS YEAR BECAME THE LARGEST MUTUAL FUND GROUP IN THE U. S.
c1nc020w IT TRADITIONALLY HAS SOLD ITS FUNDS THROUGH DIRECT MARKETING TECHNIQUES SUCH AS NEWSPAPER AND MAGAZINE ADVERTISING BACKED BY A TELEPHONE NETWORK
c1nc020x ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY CLEARLY ISN'T ABANDONING SUCH METHODS IT IS LOOKING TO BROKER DEALERS TO SELL THE NEW FUND LINE
c1nc020y AS A MANAGER MR. O'MALLEY CONCEDES HE PUSHES SUBORDINATES TO WORK LONG AND HARD HOURS IF NECESSARY
c1nc020z BUT AS A BOSS I PICK MY SPOTS TO BE TOUGH HE ADDS

c1nc0212 GENES FROM THE SURFACE PROTEIN OF THE HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS OR H. I. V. WHICH CAUSES AIDS ARE INSERTED INTO SMALLPOX VACCINE VIRUS USING BIOTECHNOLOGY TECHNIQUES
c1nc0213 A CONTROL GROUP IN THE STUDY WILL RECEIVE A SMALLPOX VACCINE
c1nc0214 THE RESULT A BOOMING ECONOMY AT A TIME WHEN ITS MAJOR TRADING PARTNERS ARE STRUGGLING TO ACHIEVE GROWTH
c1nc0215 THE JAPANESE BUILT ONE POINT SIX MILLION NEW HOMES LAST YEAR THE MOST SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE
c1nc0216 THAT IN TURN HAS TRIGGERED A SURGE IN DOMESTIC DEMAND THAT IS CROWDING STORES AND FORCING FACTORIES TO INCREASE PRODUCTION
c1nc0217 RESIDENTS HERE SAY ONE MIGHT EXPECT SUCH GOINGS ON IN MIAMI OR FORT LAUDERDALE BUT NOT IN SLEEPY WINTER HAVEN
c1nc0218 THE BIGGEST SCAM IN RECENT MEMORY WAS A RABBIT BREEDING SCHEME THAT LURED LOCALS INTO BUYING AND RAISING BUNNIES FOR PELTS IN THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES
c1nc0219 NOW THEY ARE BRACING FOR THE AFTERSHOCKS OF S. H. OIL'S FALL
c1nc021a NOT LONG AFTER THE NORTHWEST ANNOUNCEMENT THE INSTITUTE WIRED A PRESS RELEASE TO MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS DETAILING THE LARGE NUMBER OF PASSENGER COMPLAINTS ABOUT NORTHWEST'S SERVICE
c1nc021b AIRLINE PASSENGERS WHO FLY NORTHWEST APPEAR TO HAVE A LOT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT AND THEY DID SO IN DROVES LAST YEAR THE RELEASE BEGAN
c1nc021c IT WENT ON TO SAY THAT COMPLAINTS AGAINST NORTHWEST INCREASED ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTEEN PERCENT IN THE PAST YEAR
c1nc021d STOCK MARKET PROFESSIONALS WERE STUNNED BY THE PESSIMISTIC RESPONSE THAT INVESTORS GAVE THE TRADE REPORT
c1nc021e MANY OF THEM HAD COUNTED ON A BIG STOCK PRICE RALLY IF THE MARCH DEFICIT CAME IN UNDER TEN BILLION DOLLARS
c1nc021f NOW ABOUT ALL THEY CAN SEE ARE FURTHER PRICE DECLINES
c1nc021g THE POINT A POINT MR. CAMPBELL KEEPS RETURNING TO IS THAT EVERY RELIGION IS TRUE
c1nc021h IT'S TRUE AS A METAPHOR FOR THE HUMAN AND COSMIC MYSTERIES
c1nc021i IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU'RE STUCK ON THE METAPHOR THAT YOU GET IN TROUBLE
c1nc021j THE GRAND METROPOLITAN OPERATIONS WHICH WERE ACQUIRED BY THAT COMPANY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY HAVE ENJOYED A GOOD REPUTATION IN THE INDUSTRY
c1nc021k BUT PEPSICO FEELS ITS TERRITORIES CAN BE BETTER EXPLOITED DUE TO THEIR PROXIMITY TO EXISITING COMPANY OWNED BOTTLERS
c1nc021l IT OWNS ITS LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO BOTTLERS FOR INSTANCE MAKING THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA TERRITORY A GOOD FIT
c1nc021m IT ALSO ALREADY OWNS ITS BOTTLERS IN CENTRAL AND NORTHERN FLORIDA AND PARTS OF GEORGIA
c1nc021n THERE ARE SOME GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO MAXIMIZE PRODUCTION AND MARKETING EFFICIENCIES THE PEPSICO SPOKESMAN SAID
c1nc021o THE COMPANY DOESN'T EXPECT TO SEEK ANY ADDITIONAL FINANCING IN THE NEAR TERM MR. WIGGINS SAID
c1nc021p AUTODIE HAS NEVER PAID A DIVIDEND AND HAS NO PLANS TO START PAYING ONE HE SAID
c1nc021q OUR PHILOSOPHY IS TO REINVEST IN OUR BUSINESS MR. WIGGINS SAID
c1nc021r OTHER E. C. STATES ALSO HAVE RESERVATIONS THOUGH THEY DON'T FEEL AS STRONGLY ABOUT THEM AS DOES BRITAIN
c1nc021s DENMARK FOR EXAMPLE WORRIES IT MIGHT HAVE TO TIGHTEN CONTROLS ON ITS NON E. C. NORDIC NEIGHBORS
c1nc021t IRELAND WANTS TO ENSURE THAT FREER BORDERS GO HAND IN HAND WITH CLOSER SECURITY COOPERATION AMONG E. C. NATIONS

c1nc021v RIVALS SUCH AS BARCLAYS AND S. G. WARBURG GROUP P. L. C. ASSEMBLED POWERHOUSE CONGLOMERATES OF BROKERAGE TRADING AND FIXED INCOME SECURITIES FIRMS
c1nc021w BUT NATWEST THEN PUSHING TO DISLODGE BARCLAYS AS BRITAIN'S TOP COMMERCIAL BANK WAS MORE RELUCTANT TO COMMIT ITSELF TO A SIMILAR POSITION IN INVESTMENT BANKING
c1nc021x THAT SAID MR. QUAYLE HAS CLEARLY SHOWN HE CAN LEARN FAST
c1nc021y IN TWELVE YEARS IN CONGRESS AND ESPECIALLY FROM HIS ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE POST IN THE SENATE MR. QUAYLE HAS MADE HIMSELF AN INTELLIGENT ADVOCATE OF U. S. DEFENSE
c1nc021z HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE DETAILS OF STRATEGY HAS LED HIM TO SUPPORT SUCH VALUABLE BUT ARCANE HIGH TECHNOLOGY WEAPONS AS CONVENTIONALLY ARMED CRUISE MISSILES
c1nc0220 THESE HAVE POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE NATO DETERRENCE EVEN AS THEY REDUCE DEFENSE COSTS
c1nc0221 FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS THE KURDS HAVE STRUGGLED TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT KURDISTAN IN A TERRITORY THAT STRADDLES PARTS OF TURKEY IRAQ AND IRAN
c1nc0222 LIKE THE PALESTINIANS THE WORLD'S TWENTY MILLION KURDS SHARE A RELIGION A CULTURE A LANGUAGE AND A PASSION FOR AUTONOMY
c1nc0223 NEARLY HALF LIVE IN TURKEY WHICH REFUSES EVEN TO RECOGNIZE THEM AS A DISTINCT NATIONAL MINORITY AND REFERS TO THEM ONLY AS MOUNTAIN TURKS
c1nc0224 THOUGH THE KURDS OUTNUMBER THE PALESTINIANS BY A RATIO OF FIVE TO ONE THE KURDISH CAUSE HAS ATTRACTED LITTLE GLOBAL ATTENTION
c1nc0225 THE LACK OF MARKET MOVING NEWS AND THE JEWISH HOLIDAY OF YOM KIPPUR KEPT NEW YORK DEALINGS SUBDUED

c1nc0229 WE GIVE A LOOK LIKE A GENERATION BEFORE THEM LIVED HERE SAYS MR. MARDER
c1nc022a THAT'S WORTH MONEY
c1nc022b IN THE PAST THREE YEARS ALONE THE COMPANY HAS DOUBLED ITS PROFITS AND TRIPLED ITS STAFF HE ADDS
c1nc022c SALES ARE STILL UNDER TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR HE SAYS BUT THEY'RE HEADED UP
c1nc022d INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SMALL MEDICAL BILLS IS ESPECIALLY WASTEFUL
c1nc022e USUALLY IT WILL COST AN INSURER MORE THAN FIFTY DOLLARS TO MONITOR EFFECTIVELY A FIFTY DOLLAR PHYSICIAN BILL THEREBY DOUBLING THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE
c1nc022f BUT FAILURE TO MONITOR ENCOURAGES PATIENTS AND DOCTORS TO MAKE WASTEFUL DECISIONS WITHOUT FEAR OF THIRD PARTY SCRUTINY
c1nc022g A SPOKESWOMAN FOR ASHLAND SAID WE HAVE BEEN OUTRAGED BY THIS ENTIRE INCIDENT
c1nc022h COMPANY OFFICIALS NOTIFIED FEDERAL AUTHORITIES TWO YEARS AGO THAT THE IRANIANS HAD ACCESS TO THE DOCUMENTS AND REQUESTED AN INVESTIGATION
c1nc022i ASHLAND WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN OF MR. ATKINS'S INVOLVEMENT THE SPOKESWOMAN SAID
c1oc0201 AS A RESULT MANY INSURANCE ISSUES ARE DOWN TEN PERCENT TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT FROM THEIR HIGHS REACHED MOSTLY LAST SPRING
c1oc0202 THE BULLS ARGUE HOWEVER THAT SELLERS ARE LEAVING THE PARTY TOO SOON
c1oc0203 FOR ONE THING THEY SAY THE LARGE PREMIUM INCREASES OF THE PAST FEW YEARS HAVE ONLY BEGUN TO APPEAR IN INSURERS' BOTTOM LINES
c1oc0204 FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN EARNINGS GAINS OF TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TO MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX LEVELS ARE ALMOST A CERTAINTY AT THESE COMPANIES
c1oc0205 AND MOST ANALYSTS EXPECT THE EARNINGS GROWTH TO CONTINUE ALBEIT AT A MORE MODEST RATE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
c1oc0206 IF THEY ARE ALARMED TOP SIEMENS OFFICIALS DON'T SAY SO PUBLICLY

c1oc020q BEIJING SAID IT KILLED AND WOUNDED FIVE HUNDRED VIETNAMESE IN REPULSING AN ATTACK

c1oc020s THE ADMINISTRATION'S SIX YEAR CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT POLICY DESIGNED TO COAX PRETORIA TOWARD DISMANTLING APARTHEID DIDN'T SUCCEED
c1oc020t AND SANCTIONS IN THE SHORT RUN WON'T DAMAGE SOUTH AFRICA'S SELF RELIANT ECONOMY
c1oc020u BUT THE PERCEPTION OF INACTION HAS DIPLOMATIC COSTS FOR THE U. S. AND SO FOR THE TIME BEING SANCTIONS SEEM TO BE THE BEST BET
c1oc020v RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
c1oc020w THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT

c1oc020y THE SURVEY'S COMPOSITE INDEX FELL TO FIFTY EIGHT POINT NINE PERCENT IN NOVEMBER FROM OCTOBER'S SIXTY ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT

c1oc0211 MY CABDRIVER EYES ME IN HIS REAR VIEW MIRROR
c1oc0212 HIS REACTION SEEMS A LITTLE HOSTILE BUT I DON'T CARE I AM FEELING POSITIVELY VICE PRESIDENTIAL

c1oc0214 YOU CAN TOO
c1oc0215 ANYBODY CAN FOR A PRICE
c1oc0216 SHORT SELLERS NOW ARE SETTING THEIR SIGHTS ON SEVERAL OF THE BIG BLUE CHIP ISSUES THAT MAKE UP THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE
c1oc0217 THE QUESTION IS WHEN TO GO SHORT ON THE BLUE CHIPS MR. MURPHY SAYS
c1oc0218 I THINK MAYBE WHEN THIS RALLY ENDS TOWARD THE END OF JANUARY
c1oc0219 THIS HEADY MIXTURE OF PIETY AND GUTTER FIGHTING WE FEAR IS LIKELY TO DETRACT FROM CAUSES WE WOULD LIKE TO ADVANCE
c1oc021a THIS IS PERFECTLY ILLUSTRATED BY MR. ROBERTSON'S CHARGE THAT THERE ARE RUSSIAN INTERMEDIATE RANGE MISSILES IN CUBA
c1oc021b IT IS PERFECTLY TRUE THAT THE I. N. F. TREATY GIVES US NO RIGHTS TO INSPECT FOR MISSILES IN THE SOVIET'S ISLAND SATELLITE
c1oc021c AND IT IS TRUE THAT SOVIET BASES THERE ARE A DANGER TO THE U. S.
c1oc021d BUT TO POSE THESE VALID ISSUES IN THE MOST INFLAMMATORY WAY MR. ROBERTSON HAS CHARGED THAT THE MISSILES ARE ALREADY DEPLOYED AND IN PLACE
c1oc021e IF THIS IS PRESENTED AS THE ISSUE THE ANSWER IS NO AND THE VALID POINTS ARE LOST
c1oc021f THE TEAM SAYS THIS KIND OF ACTION PROTECTS ITS VALUABLE PLAYERS FROM ABUSE

c1oc0222 AT LEAST SOME OF THEM WILL HAVE TO SPROUT AT HOME IN JAPAN
c1oc0223 LAST WEEK HOUSE AND SENATE NEGOTIATORS SETTLED ON THE HOUSE FINANCING PLAN
c1oc0224 BUT WHEN THE HOUSE SENATE COMPROMISE WAS TAKEN UP ON THE HOUSE FLOOR YESTERDAY A LETTER FROM PRESIDENT BUSH WAS WAITING
c1oc0225 IF THE CONFERENCE REPORT IS PRESENTED TO ME IN ITS CURRENT FORM HE WROTE I WILL VETO THE BILL
c1oc0226 THE GUIDE LOOKS DOWN AND PULLS AT HIS SOCKS
c1oc0227 LATER HE SAYS WHEN THE RUSSIANS LIBERATED SMOLENSK A NEW COMMISSION FOUND GERMAN BULLETS IN THE SKULLS OF THE OFFICERS
c1oc0228 AND THE METHOD BY WHICH THEY WHERE SHOT IN THE BACKS OF THE HEADS WAS A GERMAN METHOD
c1oc0229 AND THEY FOUND GERMAN WEAPONS
c1oc022a THAT IS WHY THE RUSSIANS SAID IT WAS DONE BY THE NAZIS IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE
c1oc022b AND THAT IS EVERYTHING I KNOW
c1oc022c C. F. T. C. OFFICIALS WILL BE GRILLED SEPTEMBER EIGHTH WHEN THEY PRESENT THEIR PRELIMINARY FINDINGS TO THE SENATE AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE
c1oc022d SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY D. VERMONT THE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF QUESTIONING THE AFFILIATED DIRECTORS FURTHER
c1oc022e THE PUBLIC WILL NOT TOLERATE SELF DEALING OR CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BY EXCHANGE DIRECTOR OR INSIDERS HE SAID FRIDAY IN A STATEMENT
c1oc022f MR. KIDDER INSISTS THERE IS CAUSE FOR HOPE
c1oc022g GOOD TEACHERS PUT SNAGS IN THE RIVER OF CHILDREN PASSING BY AND OVER THE YEARS THEY REDIRECT HUNDREDS OF LIVES
c1oc022h PERHAPS HE IS RIGHT
c1oc022i BUT WHAT HE NOTICES AT THE FIFTH GRADE SCIENCE FAIR SEEMS MORE SIGNIFICANT
c1oc022j THE RESULTS OF THAT PAINFUL CHARADE DON'T REFLECT SOCIAL STATUS ETHNIC BACKGROUND OR TEACHING TECHNIQUE THEY REFLECT THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF EACH CHILD'S PARENTS
c1pc0201 BEFORE BEING HALTED ON THE TORONTO STOCK EXCHANGE MONDAY THE VOTING SHARES TRADED AT FORTY ONE DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS

c1pc0206 MEN AND WOMEN NOW SPEND MILLIONS ON POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS FOR JOBS THAT PAY SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS
c1pc0207 WHAT DOES THE ELECTORATE GET IN RETURN
c1pc0208 DOES IT REALLY WANT AS IT IS NOW GETTING ENDLESS HEARINGS RUN BY HUGE STAFFS CRAMMING MORE LAWS RULES AND AMENDMENTS INTO AN ALREADY FAT FEDERAL CODE
c1pc0209 SEPARATELY HEALTHCARE SAID IT INTENDS TO BUY BACK AS MUCH AS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF ITS CLASS A COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME ON THE OPEN MARKET

c1pc020c THE BROADCASTING PROPERTIES HAVE LONG BEEN REGARDED AS GENCORP'S BEST DEFENSE AGAINST A HOSTILE TAKEOVER
c1pc020d LICENSES FOR TWO OF THE TELEVISION STATIONS AND ALL THE RADIO STATIONS ARE BEING CHALLENGED BY GROUPS WHO CHARGE THAT GENCORP IS AN UNFIT OPERATOR
c1pc020e THE DISPUTE INCLUDES ALLEGATIONS THAT GENCORP FAILED TO ADEQUATELY INFORM THE F. C. C. OF ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND FOREIGN PAYMENTS
c1pc020f THAT'S TOO MUCH SHE SAYS
c1pc020g I'M AN IMMIGRANT IN THIS COUNTRY WITH NO ROOTS
c1pc020h ALL I BROUGHT WITH ME WAS MY DIGNITY MY PRINCIPLES AND MY NAME
c1pc020i MY PARENTS GAVE ME THAT NOT SONY CORPORATION
c1pc020j THE PREMIER SAID IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR MR. GHAFAR TO REMAIN AS HIS DEPUTY
c1pc020k I HAVE TRUST IN HIM
c1pc020l I CHOSE HIM DIDN'T I
c1pc020n IN ADDITION G. E. WILL TAKE CONTROL OF KIDDER'S BOARD SHRINKING IT TO TWENTY ONE MEMBERS FROM TWENTY THREE AND REMOVING NINE KIDDER EXECUTIVES INCLUDING MR. ROCHE
c1pc020o WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MR. ROCHE ALL ABOVE NAMED OFFICERS BECOME DIRECTORS
c1pc020p G. E. ALSO NAMED THE FOLLOWING KIDDER DIRECTORS
c1pc020q DEFENDERS OF THE FOOTNOTE ARGUE THAT IT MAKES SENSE AS TAX POLICY
c1pc020r WHY THEY ASK SHOULD WEALTHY BEST SELLING AUTHORS GET SUBSTANTIAL TAX DEFERRALS WHILE MOM AND POP MANUFACTURERS FOR EXAMPLE CAN'T
c1pc020s AS A RULE OF TAXES IT'S A GOOD RULE BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TAKING DEDUCTIONS BEFORE THEY GET THE INCOME SAYS ONE CONGRESSIONAL AIDE
c1pc020t IT'S THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY PRINCIPLE
c1pc020u THE RIVALS HAVE DISPUTED EACH OTHER'S CIRCULATION CLAIMS FOR YEARS
c1pc020v ACCORDING TO RECENT INDUSTRY STATISTICS THE POST'S DAILY CIRCULATION IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND THE CHRONICLE'S APPROXIMATES FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
c1pc020w THE POST CLAIMS TO HAVE ROUGHLY FORTY PERCENT OF THE HOUSTON ADVERTISING MARKET
c1pc020x DEAN THREW PLANTS IN FOUR STATES INTO HIGH GEAR AROUND THE CLOCK
c1pc020y DELIVERY TRUCK DRIVERS WORKED THIRTEEN HOUR SHIFTS WITH JEWEL EMPLOYEES RIDING SHOTGUN TO HELP FIND UNFAMILIAR STORES
c1pc020z DEAN EVEN YANKED ITS SUPERVISORS FROM BEHIND THEIR DESKS TO PILOT MILK TRUCKS
c1pc0210 WHETHER WE'RE ALL SAFE AND HAPPY NOW OR NOT THERE IS THE FUTURE TO THINK ABOUT
c1pc0211 WHATEVER THE PROBLEMS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE A GREAT DEAL TO MAKE FREE MARKETS AND LIBERALISM RESPECTABLE
c1pc0212 WILL THE GAINS DISAPPEAR WHEN MR. REAGAN LEAVES OFFICE
c1pc0213 BRAZIL UNILATERALLY STOPPED PAYING INTEREST ON AN ESTIMATED SIXTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF FOREIGN BANK DEBT LAST FEBRUARY TWENTIETH
c1pc0214 IT CITED WEAKENED FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND GOLD RESERVES
c1pc0215 SINCE THEN ITS MEDIUM TERM AND LONG TERM FOREIGN BANK DEBT HAS CLIMBED TO MORE THAN SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS INCLUDING INTEREST ARREARS
c1pc0216 MR. CHEN LEFT CRAY IN SEPTEMBER AFTER IT SCRAPPED HIS LATEST DESIGN PROJECT WHICH IT TERMED TOO COSTLY AND SPECULATIVE
c1pc0217 MR. CHEN WAS CONSIDERING USING LASERS RATHER THAN WIRES IN THAT MACHINE
c1pc0218 BUT WHILE CRAY GRANTED MR. CHEN PERSONAL NONEXCLUSIVE USE OF HIS DEVELOPMENTS THERE HIS NEW COMPANY SAID IT DOESN'T INTEND TO USE CRAY TECHNOLOGY
c1pc0219 RORER GROUP WHOSE STOCK EASED THREE EIGHTHS TO THIRTY FIVE AND THREE QUARTERS SAID IT SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE A. H. ROBINS
c1pc021a THE AGREEMENT IS A KEY PART OF ROBINS'S BANKRUPTCY REORGANIZATION PLAN
c1pc021b ROBINS JUMPED ONE AND ONE HALF TO TWENTY ONE
c1pc021c THE REFUSAL OF NEARLY HALF OF THE NATION'S ELIGIBLE VOTERS TO GO TO THE POLLS EXERTS A MAJOR INFLUENCE ON THE WAY POLITICIANS RUN FOR OFFICE
c1pc021d A HO HUM CITIZENRY PROMPTS CANDIDATES TO EMPHASIZE BLAND EPHEMERAL CLAIMS OF VISION AND LEADERSHIP RATHER THAN SPECIFIC ISSUES
c1pc021e SUCH ISSUE LESS CAMPAIGNING IN TURN MAKES IT HARD FOR THE WINNERS TO CLAIM SWEEPING POPULAR MANDATES WHEN THEY REPORT FOR WORK
c1pc021f WHY SHOULD FOREIGN IMPORTS BE A BETTER MEASURE OF U. S. EXPORTS
c1pc021g AND WHY ARE THE EXPORT DATA SO BAD
c1pc021h IMPORT DATA ARE DIRECTLY COVERED BY A SINGLE GOVERNMENT AGENCY THEY PROVIDE REVENUE FROM TARIFFS AND THEY PROVIDE POLITICALLY IMPORTANT MEASURES OF GOODS SUBJECT TO QUOTAS
c1pc021i THESE ASPECTS OF IMPORT ACCOUNTING ENCOURAGE GOVERNMENT AGENTS TO AMASS ACCURATE IMPORT DATA
c1pc021j CONVERSELY FOR EXPORTS SELF INTEREST INDUCES UNDERREPORTING
c1pc021k THE JOURNAL NEVER CAN BE ALL THINGS TO ALL READERS
c1pc021l IT DOESN'T TRY TO BE
c1pc021m WE ARE NOT PLANNING SPORTS SECTIONS OR LOCAL NEWS COVERAGE COLORED WEATHER MAPS OR STORIES ON EVERY MINOR CRISIS IN THE WORLD
c1pc021n WE DO INTEND TO REMAIN AMERICA'S NATIONAL BUSINESS DAILY AND WITH OUR EXPANDING ASIAN AND EUROPEAN EDITIONS THE GLOBAL BUSINESS DAILY AS WELL
c1pc021o THAT MEANS FOCUSING FIRMLY ON NEWS THAT BUSY BUSINESS PEOPLE TRULY NEED
c1pc021p FORD'S FOURTH QUARTER SALES WERE EIGHTEEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS UP FIFTEEN PERCENT FROM SIXTEEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR EARLIER
c1pc021q FULL YEAR SALES ROSE FOURTEEN PERCENT TO SEVENTY ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS FROM SIXTY TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS
c1pc021r THAT JUMP ENABLED FORD TO INCREASE ITS SHARE OF THE U. S. NEW CAR MARKET TO TWENTY POINT TWO PERCENT FROM EIGHTEEN POINT TWO PERCENT
c1pc021s MR. THAYER SAID MR. YOUNG RECEIVED A LUMP SUM PAYMENT TO SETTLE HIS CONTRACT WITH GIBRALTAR FINANCIAL BUT WOULDN'T DISCLOSE THE AMOUNT
c1pc021t MR. YOUNG'S CONTRACT WHICH RAN UNTIL JANUARY TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN NINETY ONE CALLED FOR A SALARY OF AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
c1pc021u IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX MR. YOUNG WAS PAID FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY SIX DOLLARS
c1pc021v SWISS OFFICIALS SAY INDONESIA HASN'T REQUESTED HELP
c1pc021w IF IT WAS TO DO SO JAKARTA WOULD HAVE TO SHOW THAT THE MONEY WAS ILLEGALLY ACQUIRED
c1pc021x SWISS BANKERS SAY THE BEST WAY TO RECOVER THE MONEY IF IT EXISTS WOULD BE FOR DOCTOR SUBANDRIO TO AUTHORIZE THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT TO ACT ON HIS BEHALF
c1pc021y BUT IF HE CAN'T RECALL THE CODE NAMES AND NUMBERS FOR THE ACCOUNTS THEN INDONESIA ISN'T LIKELY TO SUCCEED
c1pc021z AT FIRST THE REBELS TRIED TO STRUGGLE ALONG WITH THEIR HOME GROWN MULES
c1pc0220 BUT THESE ANIMALS WERE A SCRAWNY LOT BY AMERICAN STANDARDS AND WHEN THEY WEREN'T WORKED TO DEATH THEY WERE GUNNED DOWN BY THE SOVIETS
c1pc0221 THE TURKS WERE NEARBY BUT THEY ALSO HAD INFERIOR MULES
c1pc0222 THE CHINESE CHARGED OUTLANDISH RATES FULLY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MULE
c1pc0223 THE EGYPTIANS WERE QUICKLY DRAINED OF THEIR SUPPLY
c1pc0224 THE U. S. WAS THE REBELS' LAST BEST HOPE
c1pc0225 MR. WOLF WHO IS ALSO CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF UNITED WOULDN'T DISCUSS THE AIRCRAFT ORDERS IN AN INTERVIEW YESTERDAY
c1pc0226 <NOISE> BUT HE SAID HE ISN'T SURE THAT EVEN THE ONE POINT SIX DOLLARS SPENDING BILLION PLAN IS ADEQUATE BUT HE SAID HE ISN'T SURE THAT EVEN THE ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS SPENDING PLAN IS ADEQUATE
c1pc0228 MS. LIU HAD HER FIRST CHILD A BOY TWO YEARS AGO
c1pc0229 SHE WAS URGED NOT TO HAVE ANOTHER
c1pc022a SHE WAS EASY TO DEAL WITH THE PARTY SECRETARY BOASTS
c1pc022b MR. MINOLI THE U. S. GENERAL MANAGER SAYS BENETTON RECENTLY DROPPED ITS STRATEGY OF SATURATING THE MARKET WITH SMALL STORES
c1pc022c NOW IT IS CONCENTRATING ON PROFESSIONALISM AND THE SERVICING OF EXISTING STORES HE SAID
c1pc022d NEW STORES WILL BE LARGER OUTLETS CALLED UNITED COLORS THAT WILL OFFER A MUCH BROADER RANGE OF MERCHANDISE
c1pc022e BENETTON PLANS TO HAVE TEN UNITED COLORS SHOPS OPERATING IN THE U. S. BY NEXT SPRING
c1pc022f MR. MINOLI ALSO ESTIMATES THAT AS MANY AS ONE HUNDRED SMALLER BENETTON STORES MAY CLOSE IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS
c1pc022g THE OPERATION WAS A PIRATE
c1pc022h THEY HAD OPENED WITHOUT OUR BLESSING SAYS ROBERT EARL PRESIDENT OF THE U. S. OPERATIONS
c1pc022i WE BROUGHT IN OUR DISCIPLINE AND NOW IT'S DOING EXCEPTIONALLY WELL
c1pc022j MR. EARL NOTES THAT THE HARD ROCK IN TOKYO HAS A LARGE KING KONG FIGURE ON THE SIDE OF ITS BUILDING AND DRAWS MOSTLY AMERICANS
c1qc0201 EARLY IN THE DAY TRADERS WERE EXPECTING THE KIND OF LATE AFTERNOON REBOUND THEY SAW THE PREVIOUS TWO SESSIONS
c1qc0202 INSTEAD THE MARKET WHICH BEGAN THE DAY DOWN MORE THAN FIVE POINTS CONTINUED TO SINK UNDER THE WEIGHT OF PROGRAM TRADING
c1qc0203 PROGRAMS ARE TRIGGERED BY PRICE DISPARITIES BETWEEN STOCK INDEX FUTURES AND THE UNDERLYING ISSUES
c1qc0204 THE NEWSPAPER BUSINESS PROSPERS TODAY BECAUSE IT IS WELL MANAGED AND SERVES THE NEEDS OF ITS READERS AND ADVERTISERS
c1qc0205 CARRIERS SHARE ADEQUATELY IN THE PROFIT
c1qc0206 A CARRIER'S PROFIT IS TYPICALLY A PERCENTAGE OF THE NEWSSTAND OR HOME DELIVERY PRICE OF THE PAPER
c1qc0207 WHEN A NEWSPAPER INCREASES NEWSSTAND OR HOME DELIVERY RATES THE CARRIER'S PROFIT IS INCREASED PROPORTIONATELY
c1qc0208 HOW IS WALL STREET REACTING TO THE CHANGES
c1qc0209 SOME INVESTMENT BANKERS FEEL THREATENED BY IT OTHERS SCOFF AT SUGGESTION THAT THESE EFFORTS ARE TRULY COMPETITIVE
c1qc020a BUT SOME SAY THE CASE ISN'T CLEAR
c1qc020b FEW DEVELOPERS ARE BIG ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THE COST OF THESE DIVISIONS
c1qc020c THE TEST WILL BE WHETHER THE NEW UNITS ARE ADDING VALUE TO THEIR ORGANIZATIONS
c1qc020d IF NOT ONE INVESTMENT BANKER SAYS THE PARTNERS WILL KILL THEM
c1qc020e WE HAD TO SCOUR THE EARTH TO ACHIEVE THAT SETTLEMENT MR. LIEBMANN SAID
c1qc020f BUT THROUGH IT ALL RALPH WAS CALM AND RATIONAL
c1qc020g HE DOESN'T PANIC WHEN THINGS START TO GO WRONG
c1qc020h SUDDENLY ONE OF THE MAMMOTH MACHINES TILTS FORWARD
c1qc020i OUT TUMBLE FORTY EIGHT PAIRS OF LEE JEANS
c1qc020j PLUS FIFTY POUNDS OF PUMICE STONES
c1qc020k A TEAM OF WORKERS MOVES IN QUICKLY TO SHAKE PUMICE FRAGMENTS FROM THE DAMP JEANS
c1qc020l THREE OTHER BORDER CITIES ACCUSTOMED TO HARD TIMES HAVE BEEN ADDING JOBS AT A PACE WELL ABOVE THE STATE AVERAGE
c1qc020m EL PASO'S EMPLOYMENT ROSE THREE PERCENT IN THE YEAR ENDING IN JANUARY
c1qc020n IN LAREDO AND BROWNSVILLE HARLINGEN JOB GROWTH WAS TWO PERCENT
c1qc020o FOR TEXAS AS A WHOLE EMPLOYMENT WAS ESSENTIALLY FLAT IN THE SAME PERIOD
c1qc020p ALL THREE OF THESE BORDER COMMUNITIES HAD UNEMPLOYMENT RATES IN TWO FIGURES
c1qc020q DEMOCRATS HAVE THE CREDIBILITY ON THE BUDGET ISSUE ASSERTS KIRK O'DONNELL PRESIDENT OF THE CENTER FOR NATIONAL POLICY A DEMOCRATIC THINK TANK
c1qc020r NOW THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE RECORD
c1qc020s FAILURE TO COME THROUGH WITH A DEFICIT CUTTING PLAN HE ADDS WOULD MEAN AN OPPORTUNITY LOST
c1qc020t NO DOUBT MR. CHUN KNOWS HE HAS TO STEP DOWN
c1qc020u BUT THE POINT HERE IS THAT HE IS TRYING TO ARRANGE IT SO THAT HE WILL STILL WIELD THE REAL POWER FROM BEHIND THE SCENES EVEN AFTER HIS RESIGNATION
c1qc020v HIS REPEATED EXPRESSIONS OF HIS WILLINGNESS TO STEP DOWN MUSTN'T BE SEEN AS AN EFFORT TO USHER IN SOME GENUINE DEMOCRATIC CHANGE IN KOREA
c1qc020w WHAT KOREA IS NOW SUFFERING TO OVERCOME IS MAINLY A POLITICAL NOT ECONOMIC PROBLEM
c1qc020x REFORMS THAT DO NOT CHANGE THE PRESENT POLITICAL SYSTEM ARE NOT REFORMS
c1qc020y MORE TRADITIONAL ACADEMICS SAY MANY OF THE NEWER JOURNALS ARE MERELY PLATFORMS FOR MARGINAL SCHOLARS TO WRITE ON TRIVIAL TOPICS
c1qc0210 BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE WHO PUBLISH SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT WOULDN'T WANT TO PUBLISH IN THE LEADING JOURNALS
c1qc0211 COFFEE FUTURES PRICES ROSE STRONGLY AMID SIGNS THAT CENTRAL AMERICAN COFFEE PRODUCING NATIONS ARE MORE TIGHTLY UNITED IN FAVORING RESTORATION OF COFFEE EXPORT QUOTAS
c1qc0212 THE PRODUCERS BEGAN MEETING FRIDAY IN MEXICO CITY AND CONCLUDED YESTERDAY
c1qc0213 BRAZILIAN AND COLOMBIAN REPRESENTATIVES WERE OBSERVERS AND DIDN'T PARTICIPATE
c1qc0214 AN ANNOUNCEMENT AFTER THE FINAL SESSION SAID THE MEETINGS HELPED CONSOLIDATE THE PRODUCERS POSITIONS REGARDING THE NEED TO REIMPOSE QUOTAS
c1qc0215 THE INTERNATIONAL COFFEE ORGANIZATION'S COUNCIL ITSELF MEETS NEXT WEEK IN LONDON
c1qc0216 MR. CHEN LEFT CRAY IN SEPTEMBER AFTER IT SCRAPPED HIS LATEST DESIGN PROJECT WHICH IT TERMED TOO COSTLY AND SPECULATIVE
c1qc0217 MR. CHEN WAS CONSIDERING USING LASERS RATHER THAN WIRES IN THAT MACHINE
c1qc0218 BUT WHILE CRAY GRANTED MR. CHEN PERSONAL NONEXCLUSIVE USE OF HIS DEVELOPMENTS THERE HIS NEW COMPANY SAID IT DOESN'T INTEND TO USE CRAY TECHNOLOGY
c1qc0219 HE KEEPS RIVALS GUESSING
c1qc021a IN SEPTEMBER MR. MAXWELL BEGAN BUYING SHARES IN GUINNESS PEAT GROUP P. L. C. AS A NEW ZEALAND INVESTOR GROUP WAS GAINING CONTROL
c1qc021b THE NEW ZEALANDERS WITH FORTY PERCENT OF THE SHARES TWICE REBUFFED HIS OVERTURES
c1qc021c NEVERTHELESS HE DECLARED ON T. V. THAT HE JUST MIGHT BUY GUINNESS PEAT LOCK STOCK AND BARREL
c1qc021d A FEW DAYS LATER HAVING AROUSED MANY PEOPLE'S INTEREST HE RENOUNCED THAT INTENTION
c1qc021e BROKERAGE SOURCES SAID JAPANESE INVESTMENT TRUSTS ENTERED THE MARKET IN THE AFTERNOON TO HELP NUDGE SHARE PRICES HIGHER FOLLOWING THE MORNING DECLINE
c1qc021f SOME PHARMACEUTICAL STOCKS AND BLUE CHIP ELECTRICAL ISSUES SURGED
c1qc021g TRADERS THEORIZED THAT INVESTMENT TRUSTS WERE TRYING TO RALLY THE MARKET WITH THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF MAJOR SECURITIES HOUSES TO FORESTALL A SERIOUS DECLINE IN ADVANCE OF THE LONG HOLIDAY WEEKEND
c1qc021h THE EXCHANGE WAS CLOSED SATURDAY AND IS CLOSED MONDAY FOR A NATIONAL HOLIDAY
c1qc021i THE BONDS ARE NONCALLABLE
c1qc021j BONDHOLDERS HAVE THE OPTION ON FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH NINETEEN NINETY THREE TO PUT THE BONDS BACK TO THE COMPANY AT PAR
c1qc021k THE ISSUE WAS PRICED ONE HUNDRED BASIS POINTS ABOVE THE RATE OF THE TREASURY'S FIVE YEAR NOTE
c1qc021l IN JANUARY SIGNS OF A WEAKENING ECONOMY PROMPTED CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN AND VICE CHAIRMAN JOHNSON TO PUSH THROUGH A SLIGHT EASING OF POLICY ALLOWING INTEREST RATES TO FALL
c1qc021m GOVERNOR ANGELL WORRIED BY THE STRONG COMMODITY PRICES WAS RELUCTANT TO GO ALONG
c1qc021n AND SEVERAL DISTRICT BANK PRESIDENTS LATER BRISTLED BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T CONSULTED
c1qc021o STILL TRADERS WERE ENCOURAGED BY INVESTOR REACTION TO THIS WEEK'S TREASURY FINANCING ESPECIALLY YESTERDAY'S THIRTY YEAR BOND SALE
c1qc021p WE THOUGHT THERE WAS VERY BROAD JAPANESE PARTICIPATION IN THE BOND AUCTION SAID MR. LAKEFIELD OF SHEARSON LEHMAN
c1qc021q BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS WHETHER THE JAPANESE BOUGHT FOR SHORT TERM TRADING ACCOUNTS OR FOR LONG TERM INVESTMENT
c1qc021r ONE CAN UNDERSTAND WHY MR. ICAHN WANTS SO BADLY NOT TO LOSE
c1qc021s HIS FOURTEEN POINT EIGHT PERCENT STOCK INTEREST IN TEXACO IS SHOWING A PAPER PROFIT OF HALF A BILLION DOLLARS RIGHT NOW
c1qc021t HE WANTS TO PRESERVE IT
c1qc021u BUT TEXACO HOLDERS WILL GET A CHANCE TO VOTE ON HIS SIXTY DOLLAR A SHARE OFFER ONLY IF HE WINS A GROUP OF BOARD SEATS
c1qc021v THIS LACK OF UNDERSTANDING HAS INVESTORS LICKING THEIR CHOPS ON TWO FRONTS
c1qc021w ONE CAMP THINKS THAT THE STOCK HAS REMAINED UNDERVALUED AS INVESTORS GRAPPLE TO COMPREHEND THE BUSINESSES
c1qc021x ANOTHER CAMP HOPES FOR A TAKEOVER OR LEVERAGED BUY OUT THOUGH THE ERIE PENNSYLVANIA COMPANY SAYS IT DOESN'T KNOW OF ANY SUCH THING IN THE WORKS
c1qc021y FOR A. B. C. NOW NUMBER TWO A HIT WITH ROSEANNE COULD MEAN A TURNING POINT
c1qc021z PRODUCER MARCY CARSEY SAYS SHE HAS THE SAME FEELING IN HER GUT AS SHE HAD BEFORE THE DEBUT OF COSBY
c1qc0220 BUT THERE THE SIMILARITY ENDS
c1qc0221 THE COSBY SHOW'S CLARE HUXTABLE IS A LOVING LAWYER AND MATRIARCH IN A TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR SWEATER
c1qc0222 ROSEANNE IS AN ACID TONGUED ASSEMBLY LINE WORKER IN AN OLD SWEATSHIRT
c1qc0223 TRADERS SAID INVESTORS APPARENTLY WERE SKITTISH ABOUT BUYING THE KROGER PREFERRED AFTER THE COMPANY'S ANNOUNCEMENT TO RESTRUCTURE
c1qc0224 TRADERS SAID THE COMPANY WILL NOW PAY ITS DUTCH AUCTION PREFERRED HOLDERS EIGHT POINT NINE ONE PERCENT OVER THE NEXT FORTY NINE DAYS UNTIL THE NEXT REGULARLY SCHEDULED AUCTION
c1qc0225 THAT RATE IS MORE THAN TWO PERCENTAGE POINTS OVER PREFERRED DIVIDENDS BY SIMILAR SINGLE A. RATED COMPANIES
c1qc0226 MANY TRADERS ASSUME THE FINANCING WILL CONSIST OF THREE YEAR NOTES TEN YEAR NOTES AND THIRTY YEAR BONDS
c1qc0227 BUT SOME TRADERS SAY THEY AREN'T SO SURE THERE WILL BE ANY THIRTY YEAR BONDS
c1qc0228 THE REASON PRESIDENT REAGAN HASN'T YET SIGNED A TAX BILL WITH A PROVISION THAT WOULD INCREASE THE GOVERMENT'S LONG TERM BOND ISSUANCE AUTHORITY
c1qc0229 PILLSBURY'S VERSION WAS TINGED WITH COOLNESS
c1qc022a IT SAID THAT MR. SHEPPARD MERELY REITERATED HIS DESIRE TO MEET AND THAT MR. SMITH SAW NO PURPOSE IN MEETING
c1qc022b NEVERTHELESS MR. SMITH AGREED TO REPORT THE CONVERSATION TO HIS DIRECTORS
c1qc022c WE REALLY TRY TO DOWNPLAY OUR FORECASTING THE FORTY FOUR YEAR OLD ADVISER SAYS
c1qc022d YOU MAKE A BAD FORECAST AND YOUR BUSINESS IS DOWN THE TUBES
c1qc022e SO MR. DAVIS SELLS REAMS OF CHARTS AND GRAPHS ON SEVERAL HUNDRED MARKET INDICATORS TO ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS
c1qc022f IN BETWEEN THE PURCHASERS' REPORT AND THE JOBS DATA THE GOVERNMENT WILL RELEASE A HALF DOZEN OTHER SERIES INCLUDING JUNE'S LEADING ECONOMIC INDICATORS INDEX
c1qc022g THAT INDEX COULD ADD TO RECESSION FEARS IF IT DECLINES AS EXPECTED
c1qc022h A DROP IN THE GOVERNMENT'S CHIEF ECONOMIC FORECASTING TOOL WOULD MARK THE FOURTH DECLINE IN FIVE MONTHS
c1qc022i A RULE OF THUMB AMONG ECONOMISTS HOLDS THAT THREE SUCCESSIVE DECLINES IN THE INDEX SIGNAL RECESSION
c1rc0201 PHIL WALTERS WHOSE BACK YARD WOULD HAVE FACED THE PROPOSED SHELTER SAYS HE WENT TO MEETINGS TO LEARN BOTH SIDES OF THE SHELTER DEBATE
c1rc0202 BUT JUST FOR WANTING TO HEAR THE PROS AND CONS I BECAME A PRO DERELICT REVOLUTIONARY IN THE EYES OF SOME PEOPLE HE RECALLS
c1rc0203 THEY DIDN'T WANT AN OBJECTIVE STUDY
c1rc0204 THEY JUST WANTED TO PREVENT THE ONSLAUGHT OF THE BUMS
c1rc0205 THERE HAS BEEN NO SHORTAGE IN THE PAST FEW YEARS OF MAJOR EVENTS WITH ETHICAL UNDERTONES FOR CORPORATIONS
c1rc0206 CHERNOBYL'S NUCLEAR EXPLOSION AND UNION CARBIDE'S GAS LEAK RAISE QUESTIONS ANEW ABOUT THE ETHICS OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT ENDANGER HUGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE
c1rc0207 THE RASH OF INSIDER TRADING MONEY LAUNDERING BRIBERY AND SELLING COMPANY SECRETS HAS SHAKEN FINANCE RELATED INSTITUTIONS AND SENT COMPANY OFFICIALS SCURRYING FOR ETHICS POLICIES
c1rc0208 BUT WHEN L. B. O. COMPANIES SELL STOCK THE BIG WINNERS USUALLY ARE A TIGHT CIRCLE OF EXECUTIVES AND INVESTMENT BANKERS WHO EARLIER BOUGHT CONTROL
c1rc0209 PROFITS OFTEN EXCEED TEN TIMES THESE INVESTORS' ORIGINAL STAKE
c1rc020a THESE GIANT CONCENTRATED PAYOFFS FROM L. B. O.S ARE STARTING TO ENDANGER MAINSTREAM INVESTORS AND WORRY ACADEMICS
c1rc020b CAROL A FORTY ONE YEAR OLD PROFESSIONAL SAYS SHE CONTRACTED THE VIRUS FROM HER FIANCE IN WHAT HAD SEEMED AN IDYLLIC MIDDLE AGED LOVE AFFAIR
c1rc020c WE PLANNED TO GET MARRIED AND BUY A TWO STORY HOUSE TO ACCOMMODATE ALL OUR CHILDREN SHE RECALLS
c1rc020d BUT HER FIANCE GOT AIDS PROBABLY THROUGH DRUG ABUSE AND DIED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
c1rc020e THOUGH SHE REMAINS HEALTHY CAROL SAYS SHE IS ABSTINENT THESE DAYS AND FAVORS CONTACT TRACING
c1rc020f WESTINGHOUSE SAID LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF ITS ANNUAL SALES DERIVE FROM CONTRACTS WITH SOUTH AFRICAN ELECTRICITY ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST ELECTRIC UTILITIES
c1rc020g FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WESTINGHOUSE HAD SALES OF TEN POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS
c1rc020h WESTINGHOUSE HAS NO OTHER CONTRACTS WITH AGENCIES IN SOUTH AFRICA
c1rc020i ONE SIGN OF HOW GREECE MIGHT TREAT THOSE WHO BUY INTO SUCH PROJECTS CAME AROUND THE SAME TIME AS MR. PAPANDREOU MADE HIS ENCOURAGING REMARKS IN DAVOS
c1rc020j THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED IT WOULD NATIONALIZE THE PRINOS OIL AND GAS FIELDS OF THE ISLAND OF THASSOS IN NORTHERN GREECE
c1rc020k IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE OIL UNDERTAKING HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST FOREIGN INVESTMENT EVER MADE IN GREECE
c1rc020l RICHARD STEIN EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT FINANCE AT WORLDS OF WONDER SAID THE STOCK PROBABLY WAS MOVING DOWN IN SYMPATHY WITH OTHER TOY COMPANIES
c1rc020m HOWEVER HE SAID WE ARE ONE OF THE FEW TOY COMPANIES THAT EXPECT AN UP FOURTH QUARTER
c1rc020n HE SAID THE COMPANY IS EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS IN SALES OF TEDDY RUXPIN ITS TALKING TEDDY BEAR AND OF LASER TAG AN INFRARED GUN GAME
c1rc020o ATLANTIC RICHFIELD ROSE THREE TO EIGHTY AND THREE EIGHTHS
c1rc020p SANFORD MARGOSHES AT SHEARSON LEHMAN BROTHERS BELIEVES BRITISH PETROLEUM'S OFFER FOR STANDARD OIL UNDERSCORES THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S LARGE NORTH SLOPE OIL RESERVES
c1rc020q HE BELIEVES INVESTORS WERE NATURALLY GRAVITATING TO ATLANTIC RICHFIELD WHICH IS ALSO RICH IN NORTH SLOPE CRUDE RESERVES
c1rc020r IT'S ALL PART OF THE UNION STRATEGY SAYS JIM TURNER AN ORGANIZER
