c22c020x THERE ARE EVEN CONGRESSMEN WHO SAY THEY WANT TO PASS SEPARATE BUDGET BILLS THIS YEAR
c22c020y WE'LL SEE
c22c020z WHAT SEEMS MORE LIKELY IS THAT EITHER A PRESIDENT OR THE COURTS OR BOTH SOMEDAY WILL HAVE TO RESCUE THE VETO BY FORCING CONGRESS TO GIVE UP ITS ARROGANT WAYS
c22c0210 BANKAMERICA IS NOW WRITING OFF FEWER OF ITS PROBLEM LOANS THAN MOST OTHER LARGE BANKS
c22c0211 THE DEVELOPMENT HAS LEFT SOME ANALYSTS WONDERING WHETHER THE BANK IS BEING AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING ITS RECORD OF SURPRISING LOAN PROBLEMS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS
c22c0212 BUT BANK OFFICIALS SAID THEY ARE BEING PRUDENT
c22c0213 THEY SAID LOWER WRITE OFFS REFLECT PREVIOUS HOUSECLEANING AS WELL AS MORE CONSERVATIVE LENDING PRACTICES
c22c0214 IN ADDITION THE BANK HAS A BEEFED UP TEAM OF SPECIALISTS WHO ARE HAVING INCREASING SUCCESS IN RECOVERING PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF LOANS
c22c0215 I TOLD THEM THEY SHOULDN'T SIGN THE DEAL AND I HAD EVERYBODY MAD AT ME SAYS THE ATTORNEY
c22c0216 BUT YOU CAN'T TELL ME YOU COULDN'T GET A REPUTABLE PERSON TO DO THAT WORK FOR CONSIDERABLY LESS
c22c0217 ONCE YOU'RE PROMISING SOMEONE A SUM THAT HE CAN'T POSSIBLY JUSTIFY IN TERMS OF LEGITIMATE COSTS AND A PROFIT THERE'S A PRESUMPTION HE'S GOING TO MAKE ILLEGAL PAYMENTS

c22c0222 THE DEPUTY TREASURER DID IT SAYS FRANK KEEFE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET MASTERMIND
c22c0223 HE OBVIOUSLY MUST BE DOING IT BECAUSE IT IS A PRUDENT AND PROFESSIONAL THING TO DO
c22c0224 AS FOR HIMSELF MR. KEEFE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED HE'S LEAVING HIS POST IN DECEMBER
c22c0225 BY THEN THE LEGISLATURE WHICH RECONVENES TODAY TO PICK UP THE BUDGET MESS WILL BE PLAYING WHAT DID THE GOVERNOR KNOW AND WHEN DID HE KNOW IT
c22c0226 WHAT POSSIBLE EFFECT THE VARIANT C. D. FOUR COULD HAVE ON GENENTECH'S COMPETITIVE POSITION OR PATENT POSITION IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT
c22c0227 MARK RATNER BIOTECHNOLOGY'S SENIOR EDITOR FOR FINANCIAL COVERAGE SPECULATES IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S AMENDABLE WITHOUT PREJUDICE

c22c022h FOR EXAMPLE SALOMON SAYS A HALF PENNY INCREASE IN YIELD PER REVENUE PASSENGER MILE WOULD BOOST UNITED'S OPERATING INCOME BY THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS
c22c022i BUT THE LAWMAKERS ACTUALLY SPENT ONLY ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF THE MONEY AUTHORIZED UNDER THE LEGISLATION THIS FISCAL YEAR
c22c022j AND SO FAR HARDLY ANY OF THE PROMISED ADDITIONAL TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN FORTHCOMING
c22c022k WE LOST OUR BILL CONCEDES SENATOR MOYNIHAN A NEW YORK DEMOCRAT

c24c020e THE OUTLOOK IN THE SENATE IS STILL CLOUDY AS LONG AS PRESIDENT REAGAN CONTINUES TO OPPOSE A TAX BOOST
c24c020f STILL SENATE BUDGET WRITERS ARE INCLUDING A SIGNIFICANT REVENUE INCREASE IN THEIR DEFICIT REDUCTION PACKAGE

c24c021d WHEN A MAJOR NATIONAL RETAILER WENT THROUGH A COST CUTTING PERIOD A NUMBER OF OLDER EXECUTIVES WERE DISCHARGED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE DEPARTMENTS
c24c021e THESE EXECUTIVES BANDED TOGETHER AND INSTITUTED A CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST THE FORMER EMPLOYER
c24c021f A VERY SIMILAR CASE OCCURRED WITH ANOTHER NATIONAL RETAILER THAT SOUGHT TO REDUCE ITS OVERHEAD AND OPERATING EXPENSES

c24c0223 THE INDICATED TIGHTNESS IN U. S. GASOLINE OUGHT TO PREVENT THE REFINERS' FLAT OUT PRODUCTION FROM LEADING TO A PRODUCT PRICE WAR

c24c022e <NOISE> JACKSON DEMOCRATS SEE MR. JACKSON AS AN ACTIVIST STRONG LEADER WHO IS MORE WILLING TO TAKE RISKS THAN THOSE IN THE OFTEN BLANDER CONGRESSIONAL WING OF THE PARTY
c24c022f HE CLEARLY COMMANDS THE DEMOCRATS' MOST LOYAL CONSTITUENCY
c24c022g IT IS NEVER WISE TO IGNORE THOSE YOU CAN DEPEND ON SAYS SONIA JARVIS OF THE NATIONAL COALITION ON BLACK VOTER PARTICIPATION
c24c022h QUITE POSSIBLY A RECENT PROFIT SHARING BONUS HELPED
c24c022i WE DON'T HAVE AN ELEGANT FORMULA SAYS MR. BARRON
c24c022j WE SAID WE THINK EVERYONE'S ENTITLED TO A SHARE SO HERE'S A CHECK
c24c022k NEXT YEAR IF WE DO WELL THERE MAY BE A BIGGER CHECK
c24c022l IS THIS ANY WAY TO RUN A RAILROAD
c24c022m COULD BE
c25c0201 THE DELAY IS A VICTORY ALBEIT TEMPORARY FOR MR. TRUMP WHO OWNS TWO ATLANTIC CITY CASINO HOTELS
c25c0202 BALLY'S AGREEMENT TO BUY THE GOLDEN NUGGET IS WIDELY PERCEIVED AS AN EFFORT TO SCUTTLE A TAKEOVER ATTEMPT BY MR. TRUMP
c25c0203 MR. TRUMP'S DEMAND THAT THE GOLDEN NUGGET PURCHASE BE BLOCKED CAME AS PART OF A COUNTERSUIT HE FILED AGAINST BALLY IN DECEMBER CHALLENGING A BALLY FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING PLAN
c25c0204 BALLY HAD EARLIER SUED MR. TRUMP ALLEGING VARIOUS SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS
c25c0205 THE C. I. A. USED AN ABANDONED AIR BASE IN SOUTHERN ZAIRE TO AIRLIFT ARMS TO GUERRILLAS IN ANGOLA THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTED
c25c0206 QUOTING DIPLOMATIC AND BUSINESS SOURCES IN ZAIRE THE NEWSPAPER REPORTED THAT THREE SHIPMENTS OF WEAPONS ARRIVED AT THE BASE LAST YEAR
c25c0207 THE C. I. A. REFUSED TO COMMENT
c25c0208 THE OPERATING RATE IS STILL KIND OF LOW BUT IT'S COMING BACK SAID PRISCILLA LUCE SENIOR ECONOMIST AT WHARTON ECONOMETRIC FORECASTING ASSOCIATES IN PHILADELPHIA
c25c0209 THERE IS SOME CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM
c25c020a SHE SAID EXPORT GAINS HAVE SPURRED SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENT
c25c020b AS HE HAD DONE FOR THE PAST FOUR MONTHS THE PRESIDENT INSISTED THAT HE HAD SOLD ARMS IN AN ATTEMPT TO FOSTER A STRATEGIC OPENING TO IRAN
c25c020c BUT HE CONCEDED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT WHAT BEGAN AS A STRATEGIC OPENING TO IRAN DETERIORATED IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION INTO TRADING ARMS FOR HOSTAGES
c25c020d THIS RUNS COUNTER TO MY OWN BELIEFS TO ADMINISTRATION POLICY AND TO THE ORIGINAL STRATEGY WE HAD IN MIND
c25c020e THE PAYMENT DISPUTE WITH YAMAHA WILL BE A CRITICAL PART OF THE INVESTIGATION HE SAID
c25c020f SPECIFICALLY THE FEDERAL AGENCIES WILL BE EXAMINING HOW AND WHY YAMAHA WITHDREW A PROMISSORY NOTE IT HAD ISSUED TO ENDOTRONICS TO PAY FOR THE EQUIPMENT MR. HATCH SAID
c25c020g DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME HE SAID SOME OF ENDOTRONICS'S SALES MAY NOT HAVE BEEN SALES

c25c020k THAT GUY GIVES GREAT ADVICE
c25c020m THAT WON'T HAPPEN SOON IF EVER
c25c020n BUT IN CONTESTED ZONES THE GUERRILLAS ARE ALREADY INVOLVED IN A DE FACTO POWER SHARING RELATIONSHIP WITH SAN SALVADOR
c25c020o CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION IS THE POT AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW FOR BOXING'S BIGGEST FIGHTS
c25c020p IT PROVIDED FOR INSTANCE THE LARGEST SLICE OF THE RECORD SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS ESTIMATED GROSS FROM THE RECENT SUGAR RAY LEONARD MARVIN HAGLER BOUT
c25c020q MEANWHILE YOUNG HEAVYWEIGHT SENSATION MIKE TYSON PROMISES TO GENERATE CLOSED CIRCUIT QUALITY FIGHTS FOR YEARS TO COME
c25c020r MORE TRADITIONAL ACADEMICS SAY MANY OF THE NEWER JOURNALS ARE MERELY PLATFORMS FOR MARGINAL SCHOLARS TO WRITE ON TRIVIAL TOPICS
c25c020t BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE WHO PUBLISH SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT WOULDN'T WANT TO PUBLISH IN THE LEADING JOURNALS
c25c020u THE DENVER PURCHASE REPRESENTS THE THIRD MAJOR ACQUISITION MR. SINGLETON'S COMPANY HAS MADE IN MARKETS WITH DEPRESSED OIL AND REAL ESTATE ECONOMIES
c25c020v HE SAID HE BELIEVED THE OIL ECONOMY HAS BOTTOMED OUT AND IS SHOWING SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENTS
c25c020w THREE YEARS FROM NOW THESE WILL ALL BE OUTSTANDING MARKETS HE PROJECTED
c25c020x THESE ARE LONG TERM PLAYS
c25c020z ALREADY THE LEVEL OF TRADES IN WHICH THE TERMS ARE IN DISPUTE IS RUNNING AT A RELATIVELY HIGH LEVEL SAID MR. LEIBLER
c25c0210 BOTH THE BIG BOARD AND AMEX SAID THEY ARE CONSIDERING CALLING PEOPLE INTO WORK SATURDAY TO HELP PROCESS THIS WEEK'S ACTIVITY
c25c0211 THE CONVERTIBLE FEATURE IN THE BONDS WAS AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION
c25c0212 IF THE STOCK PROSPERED THE BONDHOLDERS DID NOT HAVE THE OPTION OF CASHING IN AND TAKING THE GAIN
c25c0213 NO ONE HAD SUGGESTED ROGERS WAS ABOUT TO GO BANKRUPT AND DEFAULT ON ITS BONDS THE ONLY WAY THE INTEREST COULD BE JEOPARDIZED
c25c0214 SO WHEN MR. GINSBURG FILED HIS BRIEF HE HAD NOTHING TO LOSE OR GAIN FROM ITS EFFECT ON ROGERS'S FORTUNES
c25c0215 MR. CHEN LEFT CRAY IN SEPTEMBER AFTER IT SCRAPPED HIS LATEST DESIGN PROJECT WHICH IT TERMED TOO COSTLY AND SPECULATIVE
c25c0216 MR. CHEN WAS CONSIDERING USING LASERS RATHER THAN WIRES IN THAT MACHINE
c25c0217 BUT WHILE CRAY GRANTED MR. CHEN PERSONAL NONEXCLUSIVE USE OF HIS DEVELOPMENTS THERE HIS NEW COMPANY SAID IT DOESN'T INTEND TO USE CRAY TECHNOLOGY
c25c0218 TECHNICALLY THE STOPGAP BILL WILL LEAVE THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF MONEY OVER THE WEEKEND
c25c0219 BUT THAT SHOULD HAVE LITTLE PRACTICAL EFFECT SINCE MOST OPERATIONS WILL BE CLOSED DURING THAT TIME
c25c021a CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS HOPE HOWEVER IT WILL PRESSURE LAWMAKERS TO FINISH THEIR WORK BEFORE MONDAY
c25c021b THE SEVEN SIGNATORIES HAVE AGREED TO POLICIES AIMED AT REDUCING THEIR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL IMBALANCES
c25c021c THUS THEY ARE MAKING A CONTRIBUTION TO STABILIZING THEIR EXCHANGE RELATIONS JEOPARDIZED BY THE HIGHLY EXCESSIVE DEFICITS AND SURPLUSES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED IN RECENT YEARS
c25c021d MOREOVER THEY ARE READY IF NEED BE TO INTERVENE ON EXCHANGE MARKETS
c25c021e AMONG POSSIBLE BUYERS FOR THE CANADIAN FOOD OPERATIONS ARE PROVIGO INCORPORATED AND METRO RICHELIEU INCORPORATED BOTH MONTREAL BASED SUPERMARKET CONCERNS
c25c021g METRO RICHELIEU OFFICIALS WOULDN'T COMMENT ON THE POSSIBLE SALE OF THE STEINBERG OPERATION
c25c021i ATLANTIC RESEARCH HAS ALREADY IDENTIFIED A POSSIBLE SITE FOR A GOVERNMENT OWNED PLANT
c25c021j THE SITE IS IN MISSISSIPPI WHICH HAPPENS TO BE THE HOME STATE OF TWO KEY MEMBERS OF CONGRESSIONAL APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEES
c25c021k N. A. S. A. IS ALSO CONSIDERING THE KENNEDY SPACE CENTER IN DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATIVE WILLIAM NELSON'S DISTRICT
c25c021l MR. NELSON WHO FLEW ON A SHUTTLE FLIGHT HEADS A SUBCOMMITTEE THAT OVERSEES N. A. S. A.
c25c021m IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN MY SON DIED FOLLOWING A SECOND LIVER TRANSPLANT
c25c021n WE DONATED HIS CORNEAS AND I THANK GOD FOR THAT ONE POSITIVE RESULT FROM HIS DEATH
c25c021o I KNOW OF MANY DONOR FAMILIES WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME POSITIVE EXPERIENCE
c25c021p TALKS OF BIG BUSINESS INVENTORY TURNS MIGHT HAVE SOUNDED STRANGE IN HIS PARENTS' HOME
c25c021q MR. KAVNER WAS BORN IN FRANKLIN SQUARE N. Y. A LONG ISLAND SUBURB OF NEW YORK CITY
c25c021r HIS LATE FATHER WAS A FACTORY WORKER MAKING CHEAP METAL PLATED TROPHIES HIS MOTHER WAS A HOUSEWIFE
c25c021t FRETTING ABOUT FINANCES MOST COMPANIES ARE TAKING FEWER CREATIVE RISKS
c25c021u AUDIENCES IN TURN HAVE GROWN MORE CONSERVATIVE
c25c021v YET THERE'S MORE WORK PERFORMED NOW THAN IN YEARS MAINLY TO KEEP REVENUES FLOWING
c25c021x BESIDES NARROWING THE PRICE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WOOD AND METAL SYSTEMS THESE TECHNIQUES PROVIDED THE PRECISION NEEDED IN DESIGNING PANEL SYSTEMS THAT MUST FIT TOGETHER
c25c021y ALMOST ALL THE MAJOR OFFICE FURNITURE MANUFACTURERS HAVE ACQUIRED THE ABILITY TO MAKE WOOD SYSTEMS IN RECENT YEARS
c25c021z MANA SAID OTAIBA THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES OIL MINISTER HAD BEEN MENTIONED AS THE POSSIBLE NEW PRESIDENT
c25c0220 HE HAS HELD THE POSITION THREE TIMES IN THE PAST AND WAS BELIEVED EAGER TO HEAD OPEC AGAIN
c25c0222 THE ONLY NEW ISSUE PRICED YESTERDAY WAS FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF TWELVE YEAR SENIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES FROM U. S. G. CORPORATION
c25c0225 INDEED NO CHANGES ARE LIKELY SOON BECAUSE THE WHOLESALERS AND SMALL RETAILERS THAT BENEFIT FROM THE EXISTING SYSTEM ARE WELL ORGANIZED BACKERS OF THE RULING LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY
c25c0226 THE JAPANESE DEBATE ON THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM BEGAN ONLY RECENTLY
c25c0227 EVEN AFTER A CONSENSUS IS REACHED NEW LEGISLATION MAY HAVE TO BE DRAFTED AND ENACTED
c25c0228 IN THE CURRENT DEBATE MR. BUSH IS USING THE A. C. L. U. TO PIN A LIBERAL LABEL ON HIS DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER
c25c0229 BUT THE A. C. L. U. HAS RELIED THROUGHOUT MUCH OF ITS HISTORY ON REPUBLICAN SUPPORT AND HAS ALLIED ITSELF WITH REPUBLICANS ON NUMEROUS ISSUES
c25c022a IN THE CURRENT CONTROVERSY SOME REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO MINIMIZE THEIR PAST INVOLVEMENT
c25c022b MR. TURNER MAY EVEN KNOW ALL THIS BECAUSE HIS PROTECTIONIST ARDOR IS QUITE RECENT
c25c022c IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES HE WAS A GLOBALLY MINDED FINANCE MINISTER UNDER PIERRE TRUDEAU
c25c022e LIKE RICHARD GEPHARDT AND SOME OTHER U. S. DEMOCRATS MR. TURNER MUST BELIEVE PROTECTIONISM IS A HOT BUTTON TO POLITICAL OFFICE
c25c022f WHY THIS INCREDIBLE DIVERSION OF EFFORT TO CRIMES THAT OFTEN ARE NOT CLEARLY DEFINED BY STATUTE AND WHERE IDENTIFIABLE VICTIMS ARE SELDOM FOUND
c25c022g MAYBE TOO MANY OF TODAY'S PROSECUTORS WERE INFLUENCED BY THE PREVAILING COUNTERCULTURE SUSPICIONS OF MIDDLE CLASS MORALITY DURING THEIR LAW SCHOOL DAYS
c25c022i THE LAST QUESTION WAS ALL BUT IGNORED
c25c022j ALMOST EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF LABEL AGREED THAT THIS WAS A DEFICIT THAT REALLY WASN'T A DEFICIT
c25c022k THAT AUTOMATICALLY MEANT NO ONE WAS DEALING WITH THE QUESTION AS SERIOUS ADULTS REPRESENTING EQUALLY SERIOUS CONSTITUENTS
c26c0201 MOBS OF HINDUS RAMPAGED THROUGH NEW DELHI AND BATTLED SIKHS OVER A BUS HIJACKING SUNDAY IN WHICH SIKH EXTREMISTS KILLED TWENTY FOUR HINDUS
c26c0202 POLICE REPORTED ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED ARRESTS AS THEY ATTEMPTED TO CONTROL THE SIXTEEN THOUSAND HINDU RIOTERS IN THE INDIAN CAPITAL
c26c0203 THE RIOTING ERUPTED DURING A GENERAL STRIKE CALLED TO PROTEST A RECENT WAVE OF KILLINGS
c26c0204 THE COMPUTER ALSO CAN DISPLAY A PATTERN SHOWING HOW PEOPLE NORMALLY PLACE THE TONGUE TO PRODUCE SAY AN S. SOUND
c26c0205 A DEAF PERSON CAN THEN TRY TO MATCH THE PATTERN BY PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ELECTRONIC PALATE
c26c0206 WITH CAREFUL COACHING AND TRIAL AND ERROR CHILDREN LIKE MISS GILROY CAN LEARN HOW TO MAKE SOUNDS THAT REQUIRE PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH
c26c0207 THE BANKS SOUGHT TO ELIMINATE A MISMATCH BETWEEN THEIR ASSETS PREDOMINANTLY HELD IN NON POUND CURRENCIES AND THEIR CAPITAL KEPT IN POUNDS
c26c0208 WHEN THE POUND WAS WEAK DURING THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE VALUE OF THE SCANDINAVIAN BANK'S CAPITAL FELL STEEPLY IN PROPORTION TO ITS NON DOLLAR ASSETS
c26c0209 THE BANKS THAT OWNED SCANDINAVIAN BANK HAD TO INJECT ABOUT FORTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL
c26c020a TO GET ITS MESSAGE TO MADISON AVENUE DECISION MAKERS WHITTLE COMMUNICATIONS HAS BEEN RUNNING A SERIES OF SLICK ADS IN NEWSPAPERS AND MEDIA TRADE JOURNALS
c26c020b WE'RE WASTING A LOT OF MONEY ON THIS AD ANNOUNCES A BOLD HEADLINE IN ONE
c26c020c THE POINT VIRTUALLY EVERY ADVERTISER IN EVERY MEDIUM IS PAYING TO REACH VIEWERS OR READERS WHO NEVER BECOME CUSTOMERS
c26c020d FOR EXAMPLE EXERCISE
c26c020e THE OLDER PERSON WHO FEELS THAT HE IS JUST WAITING FOR THE END LIKELY WON'T BE MOTIVATED TO GET OUT AND BE ACTIVE
c26c020f BUT SCIENCE STILL IS COUNTING THE BENEFITS FOR THOSE WHO ARE
c26c020g INDEED MANY OF THE MALADIES OF AGING CAN BE REVERSED AS WITH OSTEOPOROSIS THE LOSS OF BONE STRENGTH THAT PARTICULARLY PLAGUES OLDER WOMEN
c26c020h STUDIES SHOW A GAIN IN BONE MASS AMONG OLDER PEOPLE IN EXERCISE PROGRAMS
c26c020i A YEAR EARLIER G. M. HUGHES HAD FIRST QUARTER PROFIT OF ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS OR SEVENTY SEVEN CENTS A SHARE
c26c020j PER SHARE EARNINGS FOR THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX QUARTERS BENEFITED FROM THIRTY SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF GOODWILL AMORTIZATION IN EACH PERIOD
c26c020l THAT ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT REPRESENTS A CHARGE AGAINST G. M.'S EARNINGS
c26c020m LORIMAR TELEPICTURES FELL ONE AND ONE QUARTER TO SIXTEEN
c26c020n THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A BUYBACK PROGRAM FOR AS MUCH AS FIFTEEN PERCENT OF COMMON SHARES AND A RESTRUCTURING TO FOCUS ON ITS CORE ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION BUSINESSES
c26c020o BUT THE COMPANY ALSO SAID IT WILL RECORD A LOSS OF FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH THIRTY FIRST
c26c020p THOSE CREDITORS INCLUDE MULTILATERAL AGENCIES LATIN AMERICAN AND SOME EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS AND SHORT TERM COMMERCIAL BANK CREDITORS AND SUPPLIERS
c26c020q PERU RECENTLY RESUMED DEBT PAYMENTS TO THE INTER AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
c26c020r BUT THERE AREN'T ANY CURRENT PLANS TO RESUME PAYMENTS TO THE WORLD BANK OR THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE ADVISER SAID
c26c020s SHARON'S BOARD FOUGHT THE ACQUISITION VIGOROUSLY TO NO AVAIL
c26c020t EVENTUALLY SHARON SHAREHOLDERS TENDERED EIGHTY SIX PERCENT OF THEIR SHARES GIVING N. V. F. CONTROL
c26c020v AN EMBITTERED MR. PERRAULT LEFT THREE MONTHS LATER
c26c020x IT HAS BEEN INDISCREET ON BOTH ENDS OF PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE
c26c020y IF I HAD DIVULGED WHAT I WAS DOING MANY MANY LIVES WERE AT STAKE
c26c020z MOST OF THE DAMAGE TO STOCK PRICES CAME IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AS BOND PRICES SAGGED ADDING FUEL TO THE FIRE OF INTEREST RATE FEARS
c26c0210 BONDS IN TURN SEEMED TO BE REACTING TO A DECLINE IN THE DOLLAR OFF ITS HIGHS EARLY IN THE DAY
c26c0211 THE DOLLAR NEVERTHELESS SHOWED A GAIN FOR THE DAY AGAINST BOTH THE YEN AND THE WEST GERMAN MARK
c26c0212 THE CONVERTIBLE FEATURE IN THE BONDS WAS AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION
c26c0213 IF THE STOCK PROSPERED THE BONDHOLDERS DID NOT HAVE THE OPTION OF CASHING IN AND TAKING THE GAIN
c26c0214 NO ONE HAS SUGGESTED ROGERS WAS ABOUT TO GO BANKRUPT AND DEFAULT ON ITS BONDS THE ONLY WAY THE INTEREST COULD BE JEOPARDIZED
c26c0215 SO WHEN MR. GINSBURG FILED HIS BRIEF HE HAD NOTHING TO LOSE OR GAIN FROM ITS EFFECTS ON ROGERS'S FORTUNES
c26c0217 AFTER HIGH PRICES AND FRANTIC BIDDING AT ART AUCTIONS LAST SPRING ABOUT ONE IN FOUR WORKS DIDN'T SELL AT A CONTEMPORARY ART AUCTION AT CHRISTIE'S
c26c0218 BUT AT LEAST THE MARKET DIDN'T CRASH
c26c0219 HE HELPED US TO LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS SAYS ALFRED S. WARREN THE G. M. VICE PRESIDENT LEADING THE NEGOTIATIONS UNDER MR. JOHNSON
c26c021a HE WAS VERY REFRESHING IN SOME OF HIS THOUGHTS AND IDEAS
c26c021b BUT THE IDEAS NEVER BECAME REALITY
c26c021c G. M. EVENTUALLY SIGNED A TRADITIONAL PACT PATTERNED CLOSELY AFTER FORD'S
c26c021d YESTERDAY PEOPLE CLOSE TO FEDERATED'S BOARD SAID THAT THE COMPANY WAS STILL OPEN TO YET ANOTHER FRIENDLY MERGER PROPOSAL FROM CAMPEAU
c26c021e IF THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW US WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT
c26c021f THEY KNOW WHERE TO FIND US SAID ONE SOURCE
c26c021g WE'RE NOT STONEWALLING THEM
c26c021h ALTHOUGH MY TENTH MOVE HAD SET A STANDARD TRAP THREATENING TO WIN HIS KING PAWN MR. KASPAROV HAD TAKEN COUNTERMEASURES
c26c021i IT IS SOON APPARENT THAT I AM PRESENTING HIM WITH NO DIFFICULTIES MEANWHILE HE CONTROLS MORE SQUARES
c26c021j WHILE HE IS TAKING LONG THINKS OFTEN MORE THAN ONE MINUTE AGAINST MR. BONIN HE USUALLY MOVES INSTANTLY AGAINST ME
c26c021k MY ERRONEOUS QUEEN MANEUVER SENDS THE CHAMPION INTO HIS FIRST LONG STARE AT MY BOARD
c26c021l HE'S REALLY TAKING THIS VERY SERIOUSLY HE'S TRYING VERY HARD COMMENTS A SPECTATOR INTERNATIONAL MASTER NORMAN WEINSTEIN

c26c021n MANILA WITHIN NINE MONTHS JAIME ONGPIN WOULD BE DRIVEN BY DESPAIR TO KILL HIMSELF PENNING A NOTE TO HIS FAMILY I BEG YOUR FORGIVENESS
c26c021o BUT IN MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN HE ARRIVED FOR DEBT TALKS IN MANHATTAN IN GOOD SPIRITS
c26c021p HOPING TO TRANSFORM THE STATIST PHILIPPINES INTO ASIA'S NEXT TIGER ECONOMY HE SERENADED HIS NEGOTIATING TEAM WITH THE OLD MELODY WE'RE ALMOST THERE
c26c021q ALTHOUGH INFLATION HAS SLOWED INVESTMENT AND DOMESTIC DEMAND ECONOMISTS NOW BELIEVE A WIDELY PREDICTED DEEP RECESSION HAS BEEN AVOIDED
c26c021r INDEED A POWERFUL EXPORT BOOM ILLUSTRATING ONCE AGAIN THAT BRAZILIAN INDUSTRY IS GEARED TO SELL ABROAD AND ADJUST RAPIDLY IS FUELING A MILD RECOVERY
c26c021s IF INFLATION DOESN'T GO ANY HIGHER ANALYSTS BELIEVE THIS COULD BE MAINTAINED
c26c021t THIS WAS ROUGH ON ALL DEBTORS DOMESTIC AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL
c26c021u BUT NO ONE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS FOR DOMESTIC DEBTORS AS GRAND AS THOSE OFFICIALLY OFFERED FOR THE THIRD WORLD DEBTORS
c26c021v THE FIRST PART OF THE OFFICIAL PROPOSAL WAS TO REDUCE THE INTEREST BURDEN OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
c26c021w SECOND PROMOTE WORLD ECONOMIC RECOVERY
c26c021x THIRD NEW LOANS SHOULD BE MADE TO THE DEBTOR NATIONS BY THE BANKS THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE WORLD BANK AND EXPORT CREDIT AGENCIES
c26c021y MR. LLOYD SAYS HE HAS STARTED SELLING OFF HIS HOLDINGS TOO IN LINE WITH A FAMILY DECISION SIX MONTHS AGO
c26c021z BUT DON'T THINK FOR A MINUTE THAT HE'S LOSING INTEREST
c26c0220 A FEW MONTHS AGO HE HAPPENED UPON SOME MEN FILLING A CAR TRUNK WITH HIS GRAPEFRUIT
c26c0221 THE MEN WERE UNDETERRED BY HIS GRANDFATHERLY LOOKS
c26c0223 MS. SAVITCH WAS HYPER AMBITIOUS TROUBLED AND UNPOPULAR
c26c0224 SHE HAD CHARM IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA AN EXPERTLY CRAFTED FACADE BUT INSIDE SHE WAS IN TURMOIL
c26c0225 SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD THE PEACE IN DEATH THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE IN LIFE BUT FOR THIS BOOK AND ANOTHER ONE ABOUT HER DUE OUT SOON
c26c0226 NOW STUNG BY THE RECENT DEBT LADEN TAKEOVERS SOME FUND MANAGERS ARE PLANNING TO DUMP INDUSTRIAL BONDS
c26c0227 OTHERS WILL REDUCE THEIR EXPOSURE TO THEM
c26c0228 WHAT MANY ARE BUYING INSTEAD BONDS ISSUED BY UTILITIES BANKS AND FOREIGN COMPANIES THOSE WITH THE LEAST CHANCE OF BEING BOUGHT OUT
c26c0229 OTHERS ARE BUYING SAFER TREASURY BONDS WHOSE YIELDS ARE A PERCENTAGE OR LESS BELOW TOP GRADE INDUSTRIAL DEBT
c26c022a A. YES WITHOUT QUESTION
c26c022b IT'S MY SENSE THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY COULD TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION WITH ABSOLUTE IMPUNITY
c26c022c AND THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE
c26c022d NOW I AM CERTAIN THAT THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CAN TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION AND GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE THEY'RE SMARTER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON
c26c022e THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THOSE PEOPLE
c26c022f BUT I THINK THAT THE ACTIONS HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON CONDUCT
c26c022g MR. YEUTTER MEANWHILE SAID THE U. S. IS STILL VIGOROUSLY OPPOSED TO THE E. C.'S CALL FOR A REBALANCING OF TARIFFS ON FARM PRODUCTS
c26c022h IN EXCHANGE FOR ACCEPTING SOME TARIFF REDUCTIONS THE COMMUNITY WANTS TO BE ALLOWED TO IMPOSE TARIFFS ON PRODUCTS THAT CURRENTLY ENTER THE E. C. DUTY FREE
c26c022i THESE INCLUDE MAJOR U. S. EXPORTS TO THE E. C. SUCH AS SOYBEANS AND CORN GLUTEN
c27c0201 IN RECENT YEARS HOWEVER INSIDER TRADING CASES HAVE SOMETIMES INVOLVED PEOPLE WHO ARE QUITE REMOTE FROM COMPANIES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF INSIDE INFORMATION
c27c0202 SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THE SUPREME COURT HAS SUGGESTED WITHOUT BEING SPECIFIC THAT SUCH CASES MIGHT INVOLVE MISAPPROPRIATION OR ILLEGAL USE OF INFORMATION
c27c0203 A DECISION IN THE WINANS CASE MAY HELP DEFINE SECURITIES FRAUD BY MISAPPROPRIATION
c27c0204 FIRST OF ALL THE POLICY CONSERVATIVES WILL PURSUE THEIR UNFINISHED AGENDA OF DEREGULATION IN AREAS FROM FINANCIAL SERVICES TO REGULATION AS A DRAG ON U. S. INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
c27c0205 THEY SAY THE ADMINISTRATION MISSED ITS CHANCE AND ALLOWED ITS DEREGULATORY CAMPAIGN TO BE ALL BUT ABORTED BY CONTROVERSY OVER ANNE GORSUCH AND JIM WATT
c27c0206 THEY THINK THEIR GENERAL CASE IN THIS AREA IS OVERWHELMING
c27c0207 THEY WILL GIVE IT NEW APPLICATIONS AND CARRY IT TO NEW FORUMS
c27c0208 LAST YEAR SPONSORS OF A STRONG ACID RAIN BILL CLAIMED TO HAVE A TENTATIVE ONE VOTE MAJORITY ON THE COMMITTEE IN FAVOR OF THEIR BILL
c27c0209 THE MEASURE WAS CO SPONSORED BY ONE THIRD OF THE HOUSE AND SUPPORT APPEARED TO BE GROWING
c27c020a REPRESENTATIVE DINGELL WHOSE DISTRICT'S STEEL AND AUTO INDUSTRIES OPPOSED THE BILL BOTTLED IT UP IN THE COMMITTEE
c27c020b THE BANKS HAVE WATCHED IN DISMAY AS BRAZIL'S LEADERS HAVE ALLOWED ITS ECONOMY TO DRIFT TOWARD RECESSION
c27c020c INFLATION IS CURRENTLY RUNNING AT EIGHT HUNDRED PERCENT ANNUAL RATE GROWTH HAS SLOWED AND ITS TRADE BALANCE IS DETERIORATING
c27c020d BANKERS ARE ALSO SKEPTICAL OF PRESIDENT SARNEY'S CLAIM FRIDAY THAT BRAZIL'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND GOLD RESERVES ARE AS HIGH AS THREE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS
c27c020e THE NASDAQ O. T. C. COMPOSITE INDEX ROSE TWO POINT TWO SIX TO FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY NINE POINT OH OH

c27c020u HE TELLS THE STORY OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SALOON FOUR COWBOYS PUT UP THEIR BELONGINGS AS COLLATERAL TO BORROW A DECK OF CARDS
c27c020v THE HITCH IS THAT EACH OF THE FOUR MUST BRING BACK FOURTEEN CARDS AT THE END OF THE EVENING A MATHEMATICAL IMPOSSIBILITY
c27c020w IN THE END ONE PLAYER ENDS UP WITH ONLY TEN CARDS AND LOSES HIS BELONGINGS
c27c020x IT WAS OUT OF CONCERN FOR SUCH EIGHT YEAR OLDS THAT CONGRESS HAS OUTLAWED CHILD PORNOGRAPHY LAWS UPHELD BY THE SUPREME COURT
c27c020y SIMILARLY THE SUPREME COURT HAS SAID OBSCENE MATERIAL IS UNPROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT
c27c020z AND IT DEFINED THAT AS DEPICTIONS OF ULTIMATE SEXUAL ACTS IN WORKS THAT LACK SERIOUS LITERARY ARTISTIC POLITICAL OR SCIENTIFIC VALUE
c27c0210 A BIG COMPANY WOULD JUST HAVE CONTINUED WITH THE SAME BAD TEAM HE EXPLAINS
c27c0211 THEY WASTE HUGE AMOUNTS
c27c0212 THAT'S WHY WE AREN'T AT A DISADVANTAGE WITH THEM
c27c0213 IN A FOREST NEAR HERE THIRTY PEOPLE ARE STANDING IN A CIRCLE WITH THEIR HANDS AROUND EACH OTHER'S SHOULDERS
c27c0214 THEY ALL TURN SIDEWAYS AND PLOP DOWN ON EACH OTHER'S LAPS
c27c0215 THEN EACH GIVES THE STRANGER SITTING IN HIS OR HER LAP A BACK MASSAGE
