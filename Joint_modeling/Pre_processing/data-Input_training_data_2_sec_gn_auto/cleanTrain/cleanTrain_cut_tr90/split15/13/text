c1zc021l THE LATEST QUARTER INCLUDED A ONE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLAR WRITE DOWN OF FOREIGN INVENTORIES
c1zc021m REVENUE ROSE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TO FIFTEEN POINT SIX SIX BILLION DOLLARS FROM TWELVE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
c1zc021n BUT WITH THE IMPORTED DOGS CAME PROBLEMS
c1zc021o ONE WAS COST
c1zc021p WHENEVER THEY STRAY FROM THE COUNTRY'S COOL CAPITAL THE NORTHERN BRED DOGS NEED AIR CONDITIONED ACCOMMODATION
c1zc021q SPECIAL VEHICLES HAVE BEEN BUILT TO SQUIRE THEM AROUND
c1zc021r EACH DOG NEEDS A TRAINER
c1zc021s A COOK PREPARES THE DOG CHOW
c1zc021u HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
c1zc021v TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
c1zc021w THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
c1zc021x THE PROPOSALS REQUIRE THE APPROVAL OF HOLDERS OF SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE UNITS FOR A BUSINESS COMBINATION UNLESS CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET
c1zc021y THE VOTE OF UNIT HOLDERS REQUIRED TO REMOVE A GENERAL PARTNER IS RAISED TO SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT FROM A MAJORITY
c1zc021z AND MANAGEMENT IS EMPOWERED TO ISSUE PREFERRED UNITS
c1zc0220 YOU'VE HAD A TREMENDOUS FALLOFF HERE THAT'S ONLY GOING TO GET BIGGER AS WE APPROACH THE SUMMER DOLDRUMS ONE TRADER SAYS
c1zc0221 HE ESTIMATES THAT INSTITUTIONAL VOLUME HAS TUMBLED FROM YEAR EARLIER LEVELS BY FORTY PERCENT SO FAR THIS MONTH AND THIRTY PERCENT FOR THE YEAR TO DATE
c1zc0223 INVESTORS ALSO PREFER REMICS BACKED BY SWAP TEN PERCENT SECURITIES BECAUSE PREPAYMENTS ARE LESS VOLATILE
c1zc0224 FREDDIE MAC PASSES THROUGH ACTUAL PREPAYMENTS ON SWAP MORTGAGE ISSUES WHILE IT ESTIMATES PREPAYMENTS ON THE CASH ISSUES
c1zc0225 PREPAYMENTS ON FREDDIE MAC CASH ISSUES ARE MUCH MORE VOLATILE FROM MONTH TO MONTH THAN PREPAYMENTS ON THE SWAP ISSUES
c1zc0226 MR. TAYLOR WILL REMAIN PRESIDENT A POST HE HAS HELD SINCE MAY FIRST
c1zc0228 PREVIOUSLY HE WAS PRESIDENT OF CIGNA'S PROPERTY CASUALTY GROUP FOR FIVE YEARS AND SERVED AS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
c1zc0229 THE GUIDE LOOKS DOWN AND PULLS AT HIS SOCKS
c1zc022a LATER HE SAYS WHEN THE RUSSIANS LIBERATED SMOLENSK A NEW COMMISSION FOUND GERMAN BULLETS IN THE SKULLS OF THE OFFICERS
c1zc022b AND THE METHOD BY WHICH THEY WHERE SHOT IN THE BACKS OF THE HEADS WAS A GERMAN METHOD
c1zc022c AND THEY FOUND GERMAN WEAPONS
c1zc022d THAT IS WHY THE RUSSIANS SAID IT WAS DONE BY THE NAZIS IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE
c1zc022e AND THAT IS EVERYTHING I KNOW
c1zc022f RYAN'S FAMILY STEAK HOUSES ALSO ROSE REACHING A FIFTY TWO WEEK HIGH OF EIGHT AND FIVE EIGHTHS UP ONE QUARTER
c1zc022g VOLUME OF TWO POINT TWO MILLION SHARES MADE IT THE MOST ACTIVE O. T. C. ISSUE
c1zc022h STANDARD AND POOR'S ADDED THE STOCK TO ITS S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED STOCK INDEX TO REPLACE CULLINET SOFTWARE WHICH WAS ACQUIRED
c1zc022i STOCKS USUALLY RISE WHEN THEY ARE ADDED TO THE INDEX BECAUSE THE SHARES ARE BOUGHT TO BALANCE PORTFOLIOS THAT ARE BASED ON THE INDEX
c20c0201 FRANCE FUND INCORPORATED HAD A NET ASSET VALUE OF FOURTEEN DOLLARS AND FORTY SIX CENTS AND A CLOSING PRICE OF TEN AND ONE EIGHTH AS OF THURSDAY
c20c0202 GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INCORPORATED HAD A NET ASSET VALUE OF NINE DOLLARS AND THIRTY SIX CENTS AND A CLOSING PRICE OF EIGHT AND SEVEN EIGHTHS AS OF FRIDAY

c20c0205 FUJITSU'S BID FOR CONTROL OF FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR HAS LEFT THE PENTAGON DIVIDED
c20c0206 SOME FEAR A TAKEOVER OF THE MILITARY SUBCONTRACTOR COULD HURT NATIONAL SECURITY
c20c0207 BUT OTHERS SAY IT MIGHT ENCOURAGE JAPAN TO TRANSFER MILITARY TECHNOLOGY TO THE U. S.
c20c0208 ANY SUCH AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE AIRLINES AND AIRPORT OPERATORS COULD BE WRITTEN INTO THE CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION REAUTHORIZING THE AVIATION TRUST FUND
c20c0209 THE TRUST FUND WHICH IS FINANCED BY TICKET AND FUEL TAXES HELPS PAY FOR F. A. A. OPERATIONS AND PROVIDES GRANTS TO AIRPORTS
c20c020a SOME HAVE SUGGESTED THAT AIRPORT OPERATORS AS A CONDITION OF ACCEPTING THE GRANTS AGREE TO GIVE UP SOME AUTHORITY IN MAKING NOISE RULES
c20c020b IN HEAVY TRADING FRIDAY PROFIT TAKING CAUSED THE NIKKEI AVERAGE TO SLIP SEVENTY POINT ONE EIGHT TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIVE POINT EIGHT FIVE

c20c020f LONE STAR INDUSTRIES INCORPORATED SAID IT ARRANGED A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR FINANCING THROUGH ISSUANCE OF PROMISSORY NOTES TO A GROUP OF TWENTY TWO LENDERS
c20c020g THE EIGHT AND THREE QUARTERS PERCENT NOTES WILL MATURE IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO
c20c020h PROCEEDS WILL BE USED TO REFINANCE AND RETIRE DEBT AND FOR GENERAL PURPOSES
c20c020i LONE STAR BASED IN GREENWICH CONNECTICUT IS A PRODUCER OF CEMENT AND OTHER CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS
c20c020j THE NEW GOVERNMENT HAS STARTED TO LOWER PERSONAL INCOME TAXES AND AT THE SAME TIME IT HAS BEGUN TO BRING ITS OWN SPENDING UNDER CONTROL
c20c020k IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN BUDGET THE HIGHEST RATE OF INCOME TAX WAS LOWERED TO FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT FROM SIXTY FIVE PERCENT
c20c020l THIS IS PART OF A WORLD WIDE MOVEMENT THAT FRANCE MUST FOLLOW TO KEEP ITS MOST ENERGETIC AGGRESSIVE AND BRIGHT YOUNG PEOPLE AND TO ATTRACT INVESTORS
c20c020m MR. BOTHA ALSO MUST RULE ON THE FATE OF THE GROUP AREAS ACT
c20c020n VIOLATIONS OF THE ACT ARE RAMPANT BUT THERE WERE ONLY FOUR PROSECUTIONS UNDER IT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX ONE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND NONE THE YEAR BEFORE
c20c020o A RECENT POLL BY THE AFRIKAANS NEWSPAPER RAPPORT FOUND THAT ONLY TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF SURVEYED WHITES WANT THE ACT RETAINED
c20c020p MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR PERCENT WANT IT SCRAPPED COMPLETELY WHILE ANOTHER THIRTY FOUR PERCENT WANT EACH LOCAL COMMUNITY OR PROPERTY OWNER TO DECIDE WHO CAN RENT OR BUY HOUSING
c20c020q THE LATEST DISCLOSURES ARE AN OUTGROWTH OF THAT PROBE
c20c020r ALREADY THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS ACCUSED DELTA AIRLINES AND EASTERN AIRLINES OF ENGAGING IN UNREALISTIC SCHEDULING AT ATLANTA'S HARTSFIELD AIRPORT
c20c020s THE CARRIERS DENY THIS BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS EXPANDED ITS PROBE
c20c020t IT HAS ASKED SEVERAL OTHER AIRLINES TO TURN OVER THEIR ON TIME RECORDS AT DALLAS FORT WORTH CHICAGO'S O'HARE AND BOSTON'S LOGAN AIRPORTS
c20c020u DESPITE THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFICIAL EXPECTATIONS PRIVATE ECONOMISTS HAD BEEN PREDICTING THAT GROWTH IN THE MOST RECENT FISCAL YEAR WOULD BE BELOW EVEN THE REVISED TARGET
c20c020v YESTERDAY'S G. N. P. FIGURES WERE WITHIN GENERAL EXPECTATIONS SUSUMU TAKETOMI SENIOR ECONOMIST FOR INDUSTRIAL BANK OF JAPAN LIMITED SAID
c20c020w THE BANK HAD PREDICTED GROWTH OF TWO POINT FIVE PERCENT
c20c020x THOSE CREDITORS INCLUDE MULTILATERAL AGENCIES LATIN AMERICAN AND SOME EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS AND SHORT TERM COMMERCIAL BANK CREDITORS AND SUPPLIERS
c20c020y PERU RECENTLY RESUMED DEBT PAYMENTS TO THE INTER AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
c20c020z BUT THERE AREN'T ANY CURRENT PLANS TO RESUME PAYMENTS TO THE WORLD BANK OR THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE ADVISER SAID
c20c0210 ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE IS PROVIDED BY COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS COLLECTIONS OF SMALLER FUNDS DONATED BY MANY INDIVIDUALS
c20c0211 THE ENDOWMENTS ARE POOLED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES BUT GRANTS ARE ISSUED UNDER THE INDIVIDUAL DONORS' NAMES
c20c0212 FUNDS CAN BE STARTED FOR AS LITTLE AS FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND CONTRIBUTIONS ARE DEDUCTIBLE AT THE FIFTY PERCENT LIMIT
c20c0213 UNDER BANKRUPTCY LAW TEXACO ALONE CURRENTLY HAS THE RIGHT TO PROPOSE A REORGANIZATION PLAN FOR ITSELF
c20c0214 THAT RIGHT EXPIRES NEXT MONTH BUT TEXACO HAS ASKED JUDGE SCHWARTZBERG TO BLOCK PROPOSALS FROM ANY OTHER PARTIES UNTIL MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
c20c0215 THE PENNZOIL SPOKESMAN SAID THE REORGANIZATION PLAN TO BE OUTLINED TODAY WOULD BE PRESENTED AS PART OF A MOTION OPPOSING TEXACO'S REQUEST FOR MORE TIME
c20c0216 HE HAS A HUGE SENSE OF HUMOR AND IS BY ALL ACCOUNTS A NICE MAN
c20c0217 CRITICS SAY HE IS CAPTIVATED BY HIS OWN ELOQUENCE
c20c0218 TRUE HE SAYS SOMETIMES I DON'T KNOW WHEN TO SHUT UP
c20c0219 IF ITS MAVERICK STRATEGY WORKS SECURITY PACIFIC WILL BE SHOWING ANOTHER WAY BESIDES ACQUISITIONS FOR SUPERREGIONAL BANKS TO GROW
c20c021a THESE BANKS' MANAGERS INCLUDING MR. FLAMSON PLAN TO EVENTUALLY CHALLENGE THE BIG NEW YORK BANKS AS NATIONAL GIANTS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT
c20c021b BOLSTERED BY STRONG EQUITY CAPITAL POSITIONS SUPERREGIONALS ALREADY ARE GROWING FASTER THAN MONEY CENTER INSTITUTIONS
c20c021c WITH A REBOUND IN THE STOCK MARKET INVESTORS' FEARS ABOUT A RECESSION COOLED AND THE BOND MARKET SLUMPED
c20c021d A SHARP SLIDE IN THE U. S. DOLLAR ALSO ADDED SOME DOWNWARD PRESSURE TO BOND PRICES
c20c021e DESPITE THE DECLINE IN BONDS THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM STILL CONTINUED TO MAKE GOOD ON ITS PROMISE TO PROVIDE AMPLE LIQUIDITY THROUGH ITS OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS
c20c021f ABANDONING A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT COST A UTILITY A BUNDLE
c20c021g BUT STATE REGULATORS APPROVED A RATE INCREASE TO COVER THE COSTS
c20c021h NOW THE I. R. S. RULES THAT THE UTILITY IS ALSO ENTITLED TO A LOSS DEDUCTION FOR THE COSTS OF THE ABANDONED PLANT
c20c021i MR. WASHINGTON GREW UP IN CHICAGO POLITICS
c20c021j AS A TEEN AGER HE DISTRIBUTED LEAFLETS FOR HIS FATHER ROY A PRECINCT WORKER ON THE SOUTH SIDE
c20c021k AFTER SERVING AS AN ARMY SERGEANT ON GUAM DURING WORLD WAR TWO HE EARNED A LAW DEGREE FROM NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
c20c021l HIS MARRIAGE TO HIS HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART ENDED IN DIVORCE IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE
c20c021m BUT HE ADVANCED THROUGH A SERIES OF DEMOCRATIC PATRONAGE JOBS TO ELECTION TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND FINALLY TO CONGRESS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY
c20c021n SENATOR BENTSEN'S CORPORATE TAX PROPOSAL WOULD REPLACE A PROVISION IN THE COMMITTEE BILL ALLOWING THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE TO WITHHOLD REFUNDS FROM TAXPAYERS WHO HAVE DEFAULTED ON GOVERNMENT LOANS
c20c021o THIS PROVISION WOULDN'T RAISE ANY MONEY IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AND SENATOR BENTSEN WANTED SOMETHING THAT WOULD ALLOW A QUICKER END TO THE DIESEL TAX COLLECTION
c20c021p THE TEXAS DEMOCRAT PLANS TO OFFER HIS SUBSTITUTION WHEN THE TAX PACKAGE REACHES THE SENATE FLOOR
c20c021q COTTON FUTURES PRICES FOR COTTON FROM THE CURRENT CROP ROSE ON BUYING MOSTLY BY TRADERS WHO FOLLOW CHART SIGNALS
c20c021r THE ADVANCE IN TURN PULLED UP PRICES OF DELIVERY MONTHS REPRESENTING THE NEW CROP SEASON WHICH WILL BEGIN AUGUST ONE
c20c021s THE JULY DELIVERY ROSE ONE POINT FIVE NINE CENTS A POUND TO SIXTY FOUR POINT FOUR EIGHT CENTS
c20c021t THE OCTOBER CONTRACT WAS UP ZERO POINT FIVE EIGHT CENT TO SIXTY POINT THREE CENTS A POUND
c20c021u ONE ANALYST OBSERVED THAT NEW CROP CONTRACTS WERE UNDER PRESSURE EARLIER IN THE DAY BECAUSE OF THE PERCEPTION THAT MOISTURE IN THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA MIGHT BE HEAVIER THAN NEEDED
c20c021v BUT LATER IN THE SESSION TRADERS CHANGED THEIR MINDS HE SAID DECIDING THAT RAIN MIGHT NOT BE ADEQUATE
c20c021w ANALYSTS SAID THE PROXY FIGHT DEFEAT DEALS A BODY BLOW TO BANK OF NEW YORK'S BID
c20c021x JAMES J. MCDERMOTT JUNIOR DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH FOR KEEFE BRUYETTE AND WOODS INCORPORATED SAID THIS EFFECTIVELY PUTS THE DEAL OUT TO PASTURE
c20c021y JAMES WOODEN OF SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON INCORPORATED SAID THERE'S NO QUICK FIX FOR THIS
c20c021z GIVEN THE NATURE OF OUR OWNERSHIP IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE MR. ELISH SAID
c20c0220 THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO CONSIDER AND WE'RE LOOKING AT IT
c20c0221 BUT NOTHING IS IMMINENT
c20c0222 ONE MILLION FAMILIES FALL INTO POVERTY EACH YEAR BECAUSE OF THE DEVASTATING COSTS OF LONG TERM ILLNESS
c20c0223 THE PRIVATE SECTOR CANNOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM
c20c0224 WE NEED A SOCIAL INSURANCE PROGRAM THAT WILL PROTECT PEOPLE OF ALL AGES AGAINST THE FINANCIAL BURDENS OF LONG TERM ILLNESS
c20c0225 MR. DEMME THINKS A MAN WHO PLAYS SPOONS ON THE STREET IS FUNNY
c20c0226 HE CASTS JOSEPH L. MR.
c20c0227 SPOONS JONES TO PLAY HIMSELF A MAN WHO PLAYS SPOONS ON THE STREET
c20c0228 MR. SPOONS TELLS ANGELA WHERE SHE CAN LOOK FOR A JOB AFTER SHE'S LEFT THE SUBURBS FOR MANHATTAN'S LOWER EAST SIDE HER LITTLE BOY IN TOW
c20c0229 IN THE POSITION I'M IN I COULD RAISE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY IN TEN DAYS MORE THAN I WOULD NEED HE SAYS
c20c022a BUT I WON'T DO IT
c20c022b I WOULD BE DEFEATED BEFORE I WOULD ACCEPT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS
c20c022c BUT FREEDOM ISN'T AN ACCIDENT
c20c022d IT IS THE RESULT OF PAINSTAKING WORK TO MAINTAIN THE STRUCTURE OF LIBERTY AGAINST INEVITABLE EROSION AT THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNMENT
c20c022e I THOUGHT THAT MY WORK FOR THE A. C. L. U. WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF MAINTAINING FREEDOM FOR EVERYONE
c20c022f I NOW CONFESS MY ERROR AND EMBRACE LEADER BUSH'S PERCEPTION THAT THE A. C. L. U. IS A POLITICALLY SUSPECT LIBERAL CONSPIRACY
c20c022g UNTIL GILBERT BLEW NINE WEEKS AGO JAMAICA WAS ENJOYING A SECOND YEAR OF STRONG ECONOMIC RECOVERY
c20c022h BUT MR. SEAGA A DOUR TECHNOCRAT HADN'T TRANSFORMED THE BRIGHT ECONOMIC PICTURE INTO POLITICAL CAPITAL
c20c022i JAMAICANS COMPLAINED HE HAD STRIPPED SOCIAL SERVICES AND CUT EDUCATION
c21c0202 IT IS JUST THAT IT IS SOMETHING NEW THAT MAY BE VERY DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT
c21c0203 IN THE END THE SAFETY NET IS THE OLD AND TRIED PRODUCTION CEILINGS WHICH CAN TIGHTEN SUPPLIES AND BOOST PRICES MR. LICHTBLAU SAYS
c21c0204 A MISCALCULATION PROMPTED CALIFORNIA TO MOVE FIRST
c21c0205 LEGISLATORS WORRIED THAT PROPOSITION THIRTEEN TAX RESTRAINTS WOULD FORCE BIG LAYOFFS OF GOVERNMENT WORKERS HURRIEDLY PASSED A SHORT TIME COMPENSATION LAW IN JULY NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT
c21c0206 THOSE LAYOFFS NEVER CAME BUDGET SURPLUSES PERMITTED STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO RETAIN STAFFS
c21c0207 BUT SOME PRIVATE EMPLOYERS SAW IN THE LAW AN ANSWER TO THEIR OWN NEEDS
c21c0208 <NOISE> JEWISH ACTIVIST IOSIF BEGUN SAID HE PLANNED TO IMMIGRATE TO ISRAEL
c21c0209 BEGUN WAS FREED FRIDAY FROM A SOVIET PRISON WHERE HE HAD BEEN JAILED MORE THAN THREE YEARS AGO FOR ANTI STATE ACTIVITIES
c21c020a SEPARATELY ISRAELI OFFICIALS URGED THE U. S. TO DENY FREE ENTRY TO JEWS WHO LEAVE THE SOVIET UNION SAYING THEY SHOULD SETTLE IN ISRAEL
c21c020b IN HIS NEW JOB MR. DARMAN WILL REPORT TO SHERMAN R. LEWIS JUNIOR AND PETER J. SOLOMON CO CHAIRMAN OF SHEARSON LEHMAN'S INVESTMENT BANKING DIVISION
c21c020c HE WILL CONTINUE TO LIVE IN WASHINGTON
c21c020d SHEARSON LEHMAN IS A SUBSIDIARY OF NEW YORK BASED AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY
c21c020e INTERNATIONAL LEASE FINANCE CORPORATION IS OFFERING FIVE HUNDRED SHARES OF TRANSFERABLE PREFERRED STOCK AT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH
c21c020f THE SHARES CARRY AN INITIAL ANNUAL DIVIDEND RATE OF FOUR POINT SIX TWO FIVE PERCENT
c21c020g A NEW RATE WILL BE SET JUNE EIGHTH AND EVERY FORTY NINE DAYS THEREAFTER THROUGH A DUTCH AUCTION SAID SALOMON BROTHERS INCORPORATED HEAD UNDERWRITER
c21c020h IN A DUTCH AUCTION THE SHARES ARE BOUGHT AND SOLD AT FACE VALUE ONLY THE DIVIDEND RATE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE
c21c020i INTERNATIONAL LEASE AN AIRCRAFT LEASING COMPANY SAID IT WILL USE PROCEEDS FOR GENERAL PURPOSES TO ACQUIRE AIRCRAFT AND TO RETIRE SHORT TERM DEBT
c21c020j THE COMPANY IS BASED IN BEVERLY HILLS CALIFORNIA
c21c020k FOR KODAK A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PENALTY WOULD REPRESENT ONE DOLLAR FIFTY CENTS A SHARE AFTER TAXES
c21c020m BROWN ANALYST OTIS BRADLEY IN A RECENT REPORT
c21c020n YESTERDAY KODAK CLIMBED TWO AND THREE QUARTERS TO SEVENTY FIVE AND THREE EIGHTHS
c21c020o ITS REPORTED FIRST QUARTER PROFIT ROSE TO SEVENTY NINE CENTS A SHARE FROM TWENTY TWO CENTS A SHARE
c21c020p THE COURT DOCUMENTS LIST A SERIES OF MEETINGS TO RAISE FUNDS FOR THE CONTRAS INVOLVING COLONEL NORTH AND MESSRS.
c21c020r AROUND THAT TIME REAGAN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS INCREASINGLY BECAME CONCERNED ABOUT SHORTAGES OF FUNDS AND MILITARY SUPPLIES FOR THE CONTRAS
c21c020s FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD SPOKESMAN JOSEPH COYNE SAID YESTERDAY'S ACTION WAS DONE ENTIRELY AT CITICORP'S INITIATIVE
c21c020t ALTHOUGH FED OFFICIALS WERE ADVISED OF THE BANK'S PLANS IT WAS THEIR OWN JUDGMENT OF WHAT KIND OF RESERVE POSITIONS THEY SHOULD MAKE MR. COYNE SAID
c21c020u WE DON'T CONSIDER THIS A PRECEDENT FOR OTHER BANKS
c21c020v THE IRAN CONTRA PANEL'S BIG SCENE GOT OFF WITH A BANG YESTERDAY <NOISE>
c21c020w LIEUTENANT COLONEL OLLIE NORTH WAS SWORN IN AND BRENDAN SULLIVAN JUNIOR HIS LAWYER PROMPTLY SET OUT TO PROVE THAT WITNESSES CAN TALK BACK AT A CONGRESSIONAL HEARING
c21c020y MOTT'S SAID IT DECIDED TO LEAVE THE SUPERMARKET INDUSTRY BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO COMPETE
c21c020z THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO OWN AND OPERATE TWO RETAIL LIQUOR STORES AND TO HOLD INTERESTS IN SEVERAL SHOPPING CENTERS
c21c0210 THESE BUSINESSES ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT ONE PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S SALES LAST YEAR OF TWO HUNDRED NINETY POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS
c21c0211 SELLING THE CANADIAN BUSINESS WILL HELP T. L. C. GROUP COMPLETE ITS FINANCING ON THE REST OF BEATRICE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
c21c0215 K. MART AND BRUNO'S SAID THEIR HYPERMARKETS WHICH HAVEN'T BEEN NAMED YET WILL INCLUDE SPECIALITY SHOPS
c21c0216 THE FACILITIES WILL COVER ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OR THREE TIMES THE SPACE OF THE AVERAGE K. MART DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT STORE
c21c0217 LOCATED IN MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS THEY WILL BE TOTALLY DISTINCT FROM THE CURRENT OPERATIONS OF BOTH COMPANIES A PREPARED STATEMENT SAID
c21c0218 THE FIRST IS EXPECTED TO OPEN NEXT YEAR
c21c0219 DESPITE ALL THIS THE NEW S. E. C. CHAIRMAN SAYS HE CAN HANDLE THE CHALLENGES FACING THE AGENCY
c21c021a THEY COULDN'T HAVE A BETTER PERSON ON THE JOB AT THIS TIME MR. RUDER SAYS
c21c021c I COME WITH VERY STRONG CONCEPTUAL SKILLS WITH VERY STRONG HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION TO THE REGULATION OF THE SECURITIES MARKETS
c21c021d THE GROUP SAID IN THE FILING THAT IT ACQUIRED THE STOCK FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES
c21c021e A SPOKESMAN FOR THE INVESTOR GROUP DECLINED TO ELABORATE ON THE FILING
c21c021f GREENMAN OFFICIALS WERE UNAVAILABLE FOR COMMENT
c21c021g THE COMPANY WOULD MAKE A TENDER OFFER FOR ITS PREFERRED SHARES AT TWENTY ONE DOLLARS AND FORTY CENTS A SHARE
c21c021h MOST OF THE MORE THAN FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS REQUIRED TO RETIRE THE PREFERRED STOCK WOULD BE BORROWED MR. MOORE SAID
c21c021i AT THE SAME TIME THE COMPANY WOULD RESTRUCTURE EXISTING BANK LOANS
c21c021j FOR A SHIP OR MISSILE GUIDED BY THE WRONG TIME SIGNAL THAT LITTLE GAP COULD MEAN ARRIVING AT THE WRONG DESTINATION
c21c021k IF WE LET THE DIFFERENCE GROW SAYS MR. MCCARTHY WE COULD RUN INTO PROBLEMS OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS
c21c021l IT MIGHT BE NOON BY ATOMIC TIME BUT DARK OUTSIDE
c21c021m THE MOST ACTIVE ISSUE WAS INTEL THE BIG SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANY WHICH ROSE ONE QUARTER TO TWENTY EIGHT AND ONE QUARTER
c21c021n BUT SOME OTHER BIG ELECTRONICS SHARES SURGED LATE IN THE DAY
c21c021o S. C. I. SYSTEMS CLIMBED THREE QUARTERS TO FOURTEEN AND THREE EIGHTHS ON TWO HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SHARES
c21c021p ONE LONGTIME EASTERN PILOT INSISTED THAT THE SAFETY CAMPAIGN INVOLVED NUMEROUS SERIOUS PROBLEMS BUT AFFIRMED THAT THE CARDS OFTEN CONTAINED INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION FOR REGULATORS TO ACT ON
c21c021q I SENT IN SIX CARDS MYSELF THE PILOT SAID INCLUDING SOME INVOLVING INSUFFICIENT TAKEOFF POWER BECAUSE OF MECHANICAL PROBLEMS
c21c021r BUT TO IDENTIFY THE PLANE BY NUMBER OR FLIGHT TIME HE ADDED WOULD BE AN ADMISSION OF OUR OWN CULPABILITY IN THE PROBLEM
c21c021s ANOTHER EASTERN PILOT SAID THAT DESPITE MR. BURNLEY'S CRITICISM HE CONSIDERED THE CAMPAIGN A SUCCESS
c21c021t INOPERATIVE ITEMS THAT ONCE PERSISTED FOR WEEKS ARE BEING REPAIRED MORE CONSISTENTLY HE SAID
c21c021u AFTER LARRY SPEAKES LOST HIS JOB WITH MERRILL LYNCH I WAS A LITTLE RELUCTANT TO JOIN THE POSSE OF CRITICS
c21c021v YOU HATE TO KICK A GUY WHEN HE'S DOWN
c21c021w BUT SOMETHING MADE ME CHANGE MY MIND
c21c021x I READ HIS BOOK
c21c021y BUT SENATOR DAVID BOREN D. OKLAHOMA THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WAS LESS OPTIMISTIC
c21c021z THIS IS NO WAY TO BEGIN A RELATIONSHIP UNDER A TREATY AS IMPORTANT AS THIS IF THESE DELIBERATE AMBIGUITIES REMAIN HE TOLD REPORTERS
c21c0220 SENATOR COHEN ALSO SAID HE IS LESS OPTIMISTIC THAT THE U. S. SOVIET DIFFERENCES CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY
c21c0221 MR. GORBACHEV'S EFFORTS TO MODERNIZE THE SOVIET ECONOMY RAISE THE PROSPECTS OF WIDENING COMMERCIAL TIES BETWEEN EAST AND WEST
c21c0222 MOSCOW'S DECISION TO WITHDRAW FROM AFGHANISTAN HAS REDUCED U. S. FEARS OF SOVIET EXPANSION
c21c0223 MOST IMPORTANT MR. REAGAN LIKE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER MARGARET THATCHER FINDS THAT HE CAN DEAL WITH MR. GORBACHEV
c21c0224 THE SUPERPOWER CHIEFS HAVE NEGOTIATED ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENTS AND TALKED OF ENDING THE ARMS RACE
c21c0225 THE FOLLOWING OFFICERS DIRECTORS AND LARGE STOCKHOLDERS OF COMPANIES REPORTED CHANGES IN HOLDINGS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR
c21c0226 THOSE IDENTIFIED AS BENEFICIAL OWNERS HOLD AT LEAST TEN PERCENT OF A COMPANY'S EQUITY SECURITIES
c21c0227 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED CHANGES INVOLVED DIRECT HOLDINGS OF COMMON STOCK AND TOOK PLACE IN MAY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
c21c0228 COMPANIES ARE LISTED WHERE TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY AGGREGATE TEN THOUSAND SHARES OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
c21c0229 THUS INSTEAD OF CALMAT'S BEING ACQUIRED SELECT ASSETS WOULD BE OPTIONED AND A HUNK OF STOCK WOULD BE IN RELATIVELY SAFE HANDS
c21c022a CALMAT WOULD BE RID OF MR. BRIERLEY WHO APPEARS TO HAVE TRIED TO PUT THE COMPANY IN PLAY
c21c022b INDUSTRIAL EQUITY EXECUTIVES IN CALIFORNIA DIDN'T RETURN CALLS SEEKING COMMENT
c21c022c PERNOD SAYS THE FYFFES SHARE WOULD GIVE IT CONTROL OF MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF IRISH DISTILLERS STOCK
c21c022d IF THE COURT DEEMS THE ORAL AGREEMENT INVALID THE BIDDING WOULD REOPEN
c21c022e BUT REGARDLESS OF THE COURT DECISION THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY COMMISSION OR IRELAND'S FAIR TRADE COMMISSION COULD BLOCK ANY BID
c21c022f NOT SINCE THE NINETEEN THIRTIES HAVE CITIZENS PLACED SO MANY INITIATIVES ON STATE BALLOTS
c21c022g MORE THAN SIXTY BALLOT MEASURES RANGING FROM OPEN PIT MINING TO GOVERNMENT ETHICS TO PAROLE REFORM WILL CONFRONT VOTERS IN MORE THAN HALF THE STATES
c21c022h WHY THE EXPLOSION IN DIRECT DEMOCRACY
c21c022i A BIG REASON WE SUSPECT IS THAT LEGISLATORS ARE INCREASINGLY UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO DEAL WITH ISSUES THAT VOTERS CONSIDER IMPORTANT
c21c022j NOT ALL BLACK COLLEGES ARE ON THE ROPES
c21c022k IN FACT A NUMBER OF ELITE INSTITUTIONS ARE THRIVING IN PART BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL FUND RAISING EFFORTS
c21c022l LAST WEEK FOR INSTANCE MR. COSBY AND HIS WIFE CAMILLE DONATED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SPELMAN COLLEGE A BLACK WOMEN'S COLLEGE IN ATLANTA
c22c0201 OCTOBER'S CONTRACTING FOR TRANSPORTATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRUCTION SURGED THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT TO AN ANNUAL RATE OF FORTY FOUR POINT THREE NINE BILLION DOLLARS FOLLOWING A SHARP DECLINE IN SEPTEMBER
c22c0202 THE RALLY IN PUBLIC WORKS CONSTRUCTION DOMINATED THE MONTH'S ACTIVITY
c22c0203 MODEST GAINS IN HOME BUILDING WERE OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION
c22c0204 MR. ABBOUD ALSO GAINED A REPUTATION DURING THE FIRST CHICAGO YEARS AS BEING ABRASIVE AND SOMETIMES HARSH WITH SUBORDINATES AND THAT TAG HAS LINGERED
c22c0205 I'VE NEVER SEEN AN ADJECTIVE USED SO MUCH IN CONNECTION WITH A PERSON'S NAME HE SAID IN A NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR INTERVIEW
c22c0206 PEOPLE THINK THE A. IN A. ROBERT ABBOUD STANDS FOR ABRASIVE
c22c0207 BEING ENGLISH AND A WORKING CLASS NORTH LONDONER AT THAT IS A BIG PART OF MISS FOX'S APPEAL IN BRITAIN WHERE CLASS DISTINCTIONS STILL COUNT
c22c0208 THERE'S NOTHING PATRICIAN ABOUT HER LOOKS WHICH SUITS HER FANS HERE JUST FINE
c22c0209 A LOT OF YOUNG WOMEN HERE LOOK A LOT LIKE HER
c22c020a EVEN MORE SOUND LIKE HER
c22c020b AND NO ONE EXPECTS OR WANTS HER TO SUDDENLY DON SNOOTY JASPER CONRAN FROCKS AND POSE ON THE PAGES OF VOGUE
c22c020c BUT SIX YEARS OF HUGE TRADE DEFICITS AND BUDGET DEFICITS HAVE CHANGED ALL THAT
c22c020d BY THE END OF LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT SAYS FOREIGNERS HELD TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS MORE IN U. S. ASSETS THAN AMERICANS HELD OVERSEAS
c22c020e SOME ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS DOUBT THE ACCURACY OF THOSE NUMBERS BUT NO ONE QUESTIONS THE TREND
c22c020f IT'S UNCLEAR HOWEVER WHETHER THE TARGET COMPANY WILL SET A PATTERN SETTLEMENT BECAUSE FORD IS FAR MORE PROFITABLE THAN G. M.
c22c020g ONE INDICATION THAT PATTERN BARGAINING MAY BE BREAKING DOWN IS THE WIDE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO AUTO MAKERS' INITIAL PROPOSALS
c22c020h IN THE PAST BOTH COMPANIES HAVE PRESENTED VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL OFFERS ON THE SAME DAY
c22c020i A BIG COMPANY WOULD JUST HAVE CONTINUED WITH THE SAME BAD TEAM HE EXPLAINS
c22c020j THEY WASTE HUGE AMOUNTS
