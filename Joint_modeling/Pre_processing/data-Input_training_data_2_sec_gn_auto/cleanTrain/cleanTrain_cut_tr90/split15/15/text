c27c021j THEY MET YESTERDAY IN WASHINGTON TO REVIEW THEIR POSITION
c27c021k IT SURPRISED PEOPLE IN THE CAMPAIGN JUST HOW INTENSE THE REACTION WAS TO DOLE'S POSITION SAYS ONE OF THE SENATOR'S TOP CAMPAIGN ADVISERS
c27c021l THE ORDER CARRIED OUT THE SHIP TAKES OFF AT FLANK SPEED FROM THE BARENTS HEADED SOUTH TO AVOID DETECTION
c27c021m THEN INEXPLICABLY A FEW HOURS LATER ALL COMMUNICATION VANISHES
c27c021n NONE WITH WASHINGTON NONE WITH OTHER SHIPS NO SIGNALS FROM THE USUAL COMMERCIAL STATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD
c27c021o SOME ISSUERS ALSO ARE WARY OF DOING AWAY WITH OUTSIDE COUNSEL
c27c021p IN WASHINGTON STATE A PROPOSAL TO USE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AS COUNSEL ON ALL STATE BOND ISSUES CAME BEFORE A LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE LAST YEAR
c27c021q ITS ADOPTION WOULD HAVE SAVED WASHINGTON MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
c27c021r STRONG OPPOSITION FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE DEFEATED THE PROPOSAL HOWEVER
c27c021s THIS MAY TURN OUT TO BE AN EXTREMELY POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE ALL OF THE TOBACCO MANUFACTURERS WERE INVOLVED IN THE ALLEGED CONSPIRACY MR. DAYNARD SAID
c27c021t THERE IS A LOT OF DAMNING EVIDENCE
c27c021u NOW THE JURY CAN CONSIDER ALMOST ALL THE EVIDENCE THAT CAME IN ABOUT DEFENDANTS' ATTEMPTS TO STONEWALL AND DENY
c27c021v IN AFGHANISTAN HE SAYS PEOPLE HAVE STAYED IN THE ARMY BECAUSE THEY NEED TO FEED THEIR CHILDREN AND BECAUSE THEY WORRY ABOUT THEIR FAMILIES
c27c021w THEY JOIN OFFENSIVES BECAUSE THE SOVIETS ARE AT THEIR BACKS WITH GUNS
c27c021x NOW THAT THEY KNOW THEY HAVEN'T ANYONE EITHER TO PROTECT THEM OR THREATEN THEM IT WILL HAVE AN EFFECT ON MORALE
c27c021y THE AGREEMENT APPEARS TO THWART A PROSPECTIVE TAKEOVER BID BY NORTEK INCORPORATED WHICH HOLDS A SEVEN PERCENT STAKE IN MOHASCO
c27c021z NORTEK EXECUTIVES WERE SAID TO BE UNAVAILABLE FOR COMMENT
c27c0220 THE MOHASCO SPOKESMAN DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE AGREEMENT'S IMPACT ON NORTEK
c27c0221 ROGER AILES WHO WILL GUIDE GEORGE BUSH'S HEAVY MEDIA CAMPAIGN IS PUMPING UP HIS ANGER LIKE A LINEMAN PREPARING TO CRUSH THE OPPOSING QUARTERBACK
c27c0222 MICHAEL DUKAKIS HAS THE TOUGHEST KNEES AND ELBOWS TODAY SAYS THE NEW YORK ADVERTISING EXECUTIVE WHO ONCE PITCHED RICHARD NIXON AS WARM
c27c0223 HE'S THE MEANEST LITTLE SON OF A BITCH I'VE COME ACROSS IN POLITICS
c27c0224 THAT NEWS SENT THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE ON A GIDDY RISE OF MORE THAN FIFTY POINTS
c27c0225 BUT INVESTORS MAY NEED TO BE SHOWN MORE
c27c0226 FRIDAY'S VOLUME AFTER SUBTRACTING A BIG DIVIDEND CAPTURE TRADE WAS ONLY MODERATE AT AROUND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION SHARES
c27c0227 WORLD OIL PRICES WERE STILL WELL ABOVE THEIR NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX LEVELS YESTERDAY BUT MARKETS REMAINED WEAK NEVERTHELESS
c27c0228 IN U. S. FUTURES TRADING SPOT MONTH CRUDE OIL SETTLED BELOW FOURTEEN DOLLARS A BARREL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN TWO YEARS
c27c0229 NOVEMBER WEST TEXAS INTERMEDIATE CLOSED AT THIRTEEN DOLLARS AND NINETY TWO CENTS A BARREL DOWN NINETEEN CENTS
c27c022a RANDOM HOUSE A SUBSIDIARY OF THE NEWHOUSE FAMILY'S ADVANCE PUBLICATIONS INCORPORATED SAID THE MOVE WILL TAKE IT OUT OF THE TEXTBOOK PUBLISHING BUSINESS
c27c022b THE TWO DIVISIONS TOGETHER ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS TO NINETY MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL SALES SAID ROBERT L. BERNSTEIN RANDOM HOUSE CHAIRMAN
c27c022c MR. BERNSTEIN NOTED THAT RANDOM HOUSE HAS EXPANDED IN OTHER DIRECTIONS NOTABLY IN TRADE PUBLISHING
c27c022d TRADE BOOKS ARE ALL BOOKS SOLD DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS IN BOOK STORES AND THROUGH MAIL ORDERS
c27c022e FRANKFURT SHARE PRICES CLOSED MOSTLY LOWER IN MODERATELY ACTIVE TRADING FRIDAY AS AN EARLY RALLY FIZZLED AMID POSITION SQUARING BEFORE THE WEEKEND AND UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE LOWER DOLLAR
c27c022f THE D. A. X. INDEX DROPPED FIVE POINT NINE TO ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE POINT SEVEN TWO
c27c022g AFTER OPENING BROADLY HIGHER THE TIDE TURNED AT MIDDAY WHEN THE DOLLAR'S SLIDE TO A THREE MONTH LOW BEGAN TO WORRY MARKET PARTICIPANTS
c27c022h GET PROFESSIONAL HELP
c27c022i FOR INVESTORS WITH LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THOSE WHO MAY NEED TO SELL THEIR BONDS BEFORE MATURITY MANY ADVISERS SAY TO FORGET INDIVIDUAL BONDS
c27c022j INSTEAD THEY SAY SMALL INVESTORS SHOULD BUY THROUGH MUTUAL FUNDS AND UNIT INVESTMENT TRUSTS
c28c0201 OCTOBER'S CONTRACTING FOR TRANSPORTATION ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRUCTION SURGED THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT TO AN ANNUAL RATE OF FORTY FOUR POINT THREE NINE BILLION DOLLARS FOLLOWING A SHARP DECLINE IN SEPTEMBER
c28c0202 THE RALLY IN PUBLIC WORKS CONSTRUCTION DOMINATED THE MONTH'S ACTIVITY
c28c0203 MODEST GAINS IN HOME BUILDING WERE OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION
c28c0204 INDEED TO INVESTORS ALL SHARES OF THE SAME STOCK ARE ALIKE THE INVESTOR DOESN'T CARE WHICH ONE HE BUYS
c28c0205 BUT TWO EXAMPLES OF THE SAME STAMP ISSUE CAN DIFFER GREATLY IN VALUE DEPENDING ON THE QUALITY OF SAY PERFORATIONS INK OR GLUE
c28c0206 BUYING STAMPS THROUGH A COMPUTER NETWORK SIGHT UNSEEN COULD BE HAZARDOUS
c28c0207 MILAN SHARP GAINS IN THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS GAVE WAY TO SLACKENING SHARE PRICES IN A MORE SELECTIVE MARKET
c28c0208 THE SHARP DOWNTURN IN DECEMBER COULD LEAD TO A WEAK MARKET IN THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THIS YEAR ANALYSTS SAY
c28c0209 <NOISE> ALTHOUGH MARKET LEADERS SUCH AS FIAT AND MONTEDISON RECOVERED LATE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX MOST SHARES ARE WAY BELOW MAY VALUES ONE MILAN BROKER SAID
c28c020a <NOISE> FINANCE MINISTER GERHARD STOLTENBERG HAS REPEATEDLY TIED TAX CUTS TO REDUCING THE DEFICIT AND BALANCING THE BUDGET
c28c020b THAT ATTITUDE REFLECTS THE FISCAL CONSERVATISM OF GERMANY AT LARGE
c28c020c TAX REFORM IS LARGELY DISTRUSTED BECAUSE IT ADDS TO GOVERNMENT DEFICITS WHICH ARE FEARED AS INFLATIONARY
c28c020d PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING ELSE IN MR. O'BRIEN'S JOB AS CHIEF EQUITY TRADER AT WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT ADVISORS IS PART OF A CAREFULLY GUIDED PROCESS
c28c020e A COMPUTER PRINTOUT TELLS HIM WHAT STOCKS TO BUY
c28c020f A DAILY SCRATCH SHEET TELLS HIM WHEN TO BUY AND SELL STOCK INDEX FUTURES
c28c020g THIS IS GREAT SAYS MR. O'BRIEN AS HE FINISHES UP THE FUTURES PURCHASE
c28c020h YOU CAN BE IN AND OUT OF THE MARKET IN FIVE SECONDS
c28c020i MR. WEINBERGER IS NOT ALONE IN THIS REASONING
c28c020j THE DEFENSE PERCENTAGE OF GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT ARGUMENT WHICH APPARENTLY FIRST APPEARED IN THE MID NINETEEN SEVENTIES HAS TAKEN ON A LIFE OF ITS OWN
c28c020k IT IS NOW SO WIDELY ACCEPTED AS A MEASURE THAT IT'S BECOME A PERENNIAL COMPONENT OF THE BUDGET DEBATE
c28c020l INDEED THAT DEBATE HAS INCREASINGLY FEATURED STATISTICS ABOUT THE PERCENT OF G. N. P. BEING SPENT ON EDUCATION HEALTH AND OTHER GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS
c28c020m IT HAS BEEN SHOWN REPEATEDLY THAT THE PUBLIC SUPPORTS THE BASIC IDEA OF DEFENDING THE U. S. FROM INCOMING BALLISTIC MISSILES
c28c020n IF MR. REAGAN WANTS S. D. I. TO BE A LASTING LEGACY OF HIS ADMINISTRATION IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO START BUILDING ON THE SUPPORT THAT ALREADY EXISTS
c28c020o THAT TASK WILL BE MADE EASIER IF THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDES THE DEVELOPING EVIDENCE OF THE SOVIET THREAT
c28c020p ALTHOUGH THE ANTI FRAUD PROVISIONS OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS APPLY TO MUNICIPALS OFFERINGS REGULATION OF THE MARKET IS LARGELY LEFT TO STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS
c28c020q SOME STATES LIKE NEW JERSEY REQUIRE THE FILING OF FINANCIAL REPORTS BY MUNICIPAL ISSUERS WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE MR. TAYLOR NOTES
c28c020r OTHERS HAVE LITTLE OR NO SUPERVISION OF THE LOCAL UNITS
c28c020s PARTS THE SECOND AND THE THIRD ARE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOME INTEREST THAT MAY NOT BE DEDUCTIBLE
c28c020t TAXPAYERS MUST USE THE LONGER MORE COMPLICATED PART THREE IF ANY OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE LOAN WENT FOR TRADE OR BUSINESS EXPENSES
c28c020u GENERALLY THE INTEREST OF THE PORTION OF THE LOAN THAT FINANCES THESE EXPENSES IS DEDUCTIBLE
c28c020v A SPOKESMAN FOR CRAY DESCRIBED THE M. I. T. DECISION AS GOOD NEWS
c28c020w ASSUMING THE BIDDING DOES OPEN UP AGAIN IT MEANS THERE'S ROOM FOR TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND NOT CONSIDERATIONS BASED PURELY ON PRICE
c28c020x THE SPOKESMAN SAID IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR CRAY TO INSTALL AND OPERATE A COMPLETE SUPERCOMPUTER SYSTEM AT THE PRICES M. I. T. WANTED TO PAY
c28c020y BUT WHILE NICKEL AND ESPECIALLY COPPER QUOTES HAVE SINCE REBOUNDED ALUMINUM PRICES HAVE CONTINUED TO TUMBLE
c28c020z IT SEEMS TO BE IN PEOPLE'S INTEREST TO KEEP THE PRICE RIGHT DOWN NOW SAYS ONE LONDON EXCHANGE TRADER
c28c0210 THIS WILL ULTIMATELY GIVE THEM MORE BUYING OPPORTUNITIES DOWN THE LINE
c28c0211 BUT INSIDE ROOM SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTEEN THE JAPANESE SEE THE SITUATION SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY
c28c0212 THEY REASON LIKE THIS IF THE U. S. IMPOSES SANCTIONS THEY MOST LIKELY WILL BE AIMED AT JAPANESE CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN THE U. S.
c28c0213 BUT THAT WOULD HURT THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN WORKERS WHO ARE EMPLOYED EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY SUCH COMPANIES
c28c0214 THE POLITICAL FALLOUT FOR THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION MIGHT BE TOO GREAT TO RISK THAT
c28c0215 IT WAS LEFT TO MODERATOR JAMES P. GANNON EDITOR OF THE DES MOINES REGISTER WHICH SPONSORED THE DEBATE TO BRING UP MR. HART'S INFIDELITY
c28c0216 MR. GANNON REMINDED MR. HART HE HAD TOLD EDITORS OF THE REGISTER THAT IF HE IS ELECTED HE WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST ADULTERER IN THE WHITE HOUSE
c28c0217 MR. GANNON ASKED SHOULD VOTERS IN IOWA IGNORE THESE QUESTIONS OF CHARACTER AND JUDGMENT
c28c0218 DRAMS DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORIES ARE A PARTICULAR EXAMPLE
c28c0219 OUR SYSTEMS GROUP USES THEM ALONG WITH OUR OWN MICROPROCESSORS TO BUILD MICROCOMPUTER SYSTEMS
c28c021a EVEN THOUGH INTEL WAS THE FIRST MANUFACTURER OF SUCH DEVICES WE ALONG WITH MOST OTHER U. S. MANUFACTURERS STOPPED MAKING THEM YEARS AGO
c28c021b TODAY A U. S. DRAM IS PRACTICALLY AN EXTINCT SPECIES
c28c021c GORDON PYE CHIEF ECONOMIST AT IRVING TRUST CO CONTENDS THAT INTEREST RATES MAY DROP FURTHER BUT WILL LURCH BACK UP AGAIN LATER THIS YEAR
c28c021d HE SAYS YIELDS ON LONG TERM TREASURY ISSUES MAY DECLINE TO AS LOW AS EIGHT PERCENT BUT THEN YIELDS WILL START MOVING THE OTHER WAY
c28c021e WE'LL HIT TEN PERCENT A COUPLE OF TIMES AND WE'LL GO PAST IT LATER THIS YEAR
c28c021f THE SIXTY THREE YEAR OLD ADMIRAL IS PHILOSOPHICAL ABOUT HIS POSITION
c28c021g THE CHAIRMAN ISN'T IN COMMAND HE SAYS MATTER OF FACTLY
c28c021h I'M AN ADVISER
c28c021i INDEED THE J. C. S. CHIEF ISN'T IN THE CHAIN OF COMMAND WHICH PROCEEDS FROM THE PRESIDENT TO THE DEFENSE SECRETARY TO MAJOR COMMANDERS AROUND THE WORLD
c28c021j AND ALTHOUGH ADMIRAL CROWE BELIEVES THAT THE MILITARY REFORM LAW STRENGTHENS HIS HAND HE DOESN'T EXPECT IT TO TRANSFORM THE J. C. S. CHAIRMANSHIP QUICKLY
c28c021k IT'S TOUGH TO CHANGE ATTITUDES HE SAYS
c28c021l THIS MAY TURN OUT TO BE AN EXTREMELY POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE ALL OF THE TOBACCO MANUFACTURERS WERE INVOLVED IN THE ALLEGED CONSPIRACY MR. DAYNARD SAID
c28c021m THERE IS A LOT OF DAMNING EVIDENCE
c28c021n NOW THE JURY CAN CONSIDER ALMOST ALL THE EVIDENCE THAT CAME IN ABOUT DEFENDANTS' ATTEMPTS TO STONEWALL AND DENY
c28c021o BUT MR. EDELL HAS ARGUED THAT MRS. CIPOLLONE HEARD CONFLICTING MESSAGES ABOUT THE HAZARDS OF HER HABIT
c28c021p IN A DEPOSITION READ TO THE COURT IN APRIL MRS. CIPOLLONE SAID SHE WAS INITIALLY ATTRACTED TO SMOKING BECAUSE OF ITS SEDUCTIVE CONNOTATIONS OF HOLLYWOOD AND GLAMOUR
c28c021q THE CIGARETTE MAKERS' ADVERTISEMENTS REINFORCED THESE PERCEPTIONS AND OTHERS OF THE PRODUCT'S SAFETY THE PLAINTIFF CONTENDS
c28c021r BUT MR. CONABLE'S OWN NATURE STILL ISN'T CLEAR REPRESENTATIVE LAFALCE ARGUES
c28c021s BARBER CONABLE IS AN OUTSTANDING PERSON HE SAYS
c28c021t HE HAD A STRONG IDENTITY HERE IN CONGRESS WHICH HE EARNED
c28c021u BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE HIS OWN IDENTITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD BANK
c28c021v HE WAS CREATED BY JIM BAKER AND GEORGE BUSH IN THIS JOB
c28c021w HIS REPUTATION NOW RESTS ON HOW HE DEFINES HIMSELF
c28c021x THIS LACK OF UNDERSTANDING HAS INVESTORS LICKING THEIR CHOPS ON TWO FRONTS
c28c021y ONE CAMP THINKS THAT THE STOCK HAS REMAINED UNDERVALUED AS INVESTORS GRAPPLE TO COMPREHEND THE BUSINESSES
c28c021z ANOTHER CAMP HOPES FOR A TAKEOVER OR LEVERAGED BUY OUT THOUGH THE ERIE PENNSYLVANIA COMPANY SAYS IT DOESN'T KNOW OF ANY SUCH THING IN THE WORKS
c28c0221 THE PROPOSALS DON'T AMOUNT TO AN ASSAULT ON THE CURRENT TAX STRUCTURE CONTENDS BUSH SPOKESMAN STEPHEN HART
c28c0222 THEY ARE LASER LIKE OPENINGS IN THE TAX STRUCTURE FOR SPECIFIC REASONS HE SAYS
c28c0223 ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN FACTORED INTO HIS FLEXIBLE FREEZE OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING
c28c0224 HE ISN'T GOING TO RAISE TAXES PERIOD
c28c0225 THE SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN ENTITLES HOLDERS TO BUY STOCK IN THE SURVIVING COMPANY AT HALF PRICE IN THE EVENT OF A HOSTILE TAKEOVER
c28c0226 G. AND W. SAID IT ISN'T AWARE OF ANY EFFORT TO ACQUIRE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY
c28c0227 THE DISTRIBUTION IS PAYABLE SEPTEMBER NINETEENTH TO STOCK OF RECORD THAT DATE
c28c0228 THE RIGHTS EXPIRE SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT UNLESS REDEEMED EARLIER
c28c0229 I'D NEVER OWNED A SHARE NEVER EVEN KNEW WHAT A DIVIDEND OR THE STOCK EXCHANGE IS HE SAYS
c28c022a NOW I FOLLOW PRICES EVERY DAY IN THE PAPER
c28c022b WHEN I COMPARE WHAT I HAVE TO WHAT I HAD IN NINETEEN SEVENTY I HAVE NO DOUBT I WILL VOTE YES HE SAYS
c28c022c OVERALL CONSUMER SPENDING HAS SLOWED SINCE LAST YEAR'S STOCK MARKET CRASH BUT IT'S STILL AT A LEVEL THAT WORRIES SOME ECONOMISTS
c28c022d CONSUMER CREDIT SLOWED SHARPLY IN JULY REFLECTING SLUGGISH SALES
c28c022e TOO MUCH SPENDING AT HOME COUPLED WITH HEAVY DEMAND FOR EXPORTS COULD OVERLOAD AN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THAT IS ALREADY RUNNING NEAR CAPACITY
c28c022f NOW HIS LAUGHTER IS GONE
c28c022g BECAUSE OF DRUGS HE IS DEAD
c28c022h AND EVERY DAY MY HEART BREAKS A LITTLE MORE
c29c0201 EVEN WHEN COMPLAINTS ARE FILED THEY CAN BE DIFFICULT TO VERIFY
c29c0202 AGENCIES GENERALLY DON'T USE UNDERCOVER TESTERS POSING AS PROSPECTIVE TENANTS AS THEY DO IN RACE DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS THEY FEAR THAT THE TESTER COULD BE ATTACKED
c29c0203 INSTEAD THEY TRY TO BUILD CASES ON THE TESTIMONY OF CURRENT AND FORMER TENANTS
c29c0204 STOCK EXCHANGES COMMODITY MARKETS MANY BANKS AND SOME BUSINESSES WILL BE CLOSED IN THE U. S. MONDAY IN OBSERVANCE OF WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY
c29c0205 FEDERAL OFFICES WILL BE CLOSED AND THERE WON'T BE ANY REGULAR MAIL DELIVERIES
c29c0206 MANY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICES ALSO WILL BE CLOSED
c29c0207 THAT SORT OF HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION HAS LEGAL EXPERTS INVESTMENT BANKERS AND STOCK MARKET INVESTORS TIED UP IN KNOTS THESE DAYS
c29c0208 NICHOLAS BRADY CHAIRMAN OF DILLON READ AND COMPANY SAID IN SENATE TESTIMONY LAST MONTH THAT HE IS CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT IS PERMISSIBLE AND WHAT ISN'T
c29c0209 THERE NEEDS TO BE CLARIFICATION OF EXACTLY WHAT CONDUCT IS TO BE PROHIBITED BY THE CONCEPT OF INSIDER TRADING SAID MR. BRADY
c29c020a PUBLISHING SO CALLED BACKLIST BOOKS THAT ARE KEPT IN PRINT FOR YEARS ON END HAS SOME ADVANTAGES OVER PUBLISHING BEST SELLERS
c29c020b A GOOD FISHING BOOK WILL NEVER MATCH A JACKIE COLLINS NOVEL IN TOTAL SALES
c29c020c BUT IT WILL OUTLIVE HER RACY FICTION WITH ITS FICKLE READERS
c29c020d PUBLISHERS WILL DUMP MOST OF THIS YEAR'S BEST SELLERS ON REMAINDER TABLES NEXT YEAR WHERE THEY MAY FETCH AS LITTLE AS ONE DOLLAR APIECE
c29c020e IN A UNANIMOUS RULING THE JUSTICES UPHELD A FEDERAL LAW ALLOWING RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS ENGAGED IN NONPROFIT ACTIVITIES TO LIMIT HIRING TO PEOPLE OF THEIR OWN FAITH
c29c020f THE COURT RULED THAT THE CONSTITUTION ISN'T VIOLATED BY EXEMPTING SUCH GROUPS FROM THE FEDERAL LAW THAT BARS BIAS IN EMPLOYMENT BASED ON RELIGION
c29c020g THE DECISION GIVES RELIGIOUS GROUPS THE FLEXIBILITY TO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN HIRING CRITERIA
c29c020h THE COMPANY SAID IT HAS IDENTIFIED SEVENTY TWO VEHICLES DAMAGED DURING TESTING
c29c020i THIRTY TWO OF THOSE WERE SCRAPPED OR SOLD AS USED
c29c020j BUT FORTY WERE REPAIRED AND SOLD AS NEW EVEN THOUGH REPAIRS IN ONE CASE TOTALED NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS
c29c020k THESE VEHICLES WILL BE REPLACED WITH NEW CHRYSLER MODELS
c29c020l THE COMPANY SAID IT IS NOTIFYING DEALERS AND OWNERS PARTLY THROUGH A BIG ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN IT PLANS TO KICK OFF TODAY
c29c020m WHAT I AM SUGGESTING GENTLEMEN IS THAT THE PROCESS HAS NOT WORKED
c29c020n IT HAS BEEN INDISCREET ON BOTH ENDS OF PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE
c29c020o IF I HAD DIVULGED WHAT I WAS DOING MANY MANY LIVES WERE AT STAKE
c29c020p YESTERDAY THE AGENCY REVERSED THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR FINDING THAT MEREDITH HAD VIOLATED THE DOCTRINE
c29c020q THE SO CALLED FAIRNESS DOCTRINE IS A MISNOMER SAID DIANE KILLORY THE AGENCY'S GENERAL COUNSEL
c29c020r IT PROMOTES BLANDNESS AND NOTHINGNESS BY CHILLING THE VERY SPEECH IT WAS MEANT TO FOSTER
c29c020s SENATOR EXON HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST OUTSPOKEN PROPONENTS OF BLOCKING CERTAIN FOREIGN INVESTMENT
c29c020t WHEN FUJITSU ANNOUNCED ITS PLANS TO TAKE OVER FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION LAST YEAR HE WAS QUICK TO COMPLAIN
c29c020u FAIRCHILD ACCOUNTS FOR ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF U. S. SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTION AND WAS ALREADY CONTROLLED BY SCHLUMBERGER CORPORATION A LARGELY FRENCH OWNED FIRM
c29c020v NEVERTHELESS SENATOR EXON SAID THAT THE MERGER WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY
c29c020w NEVERTHELESS FIRST OPTIONS STILL LETS CUSTOMERS SUCH AS JAMES F. HART TRADE IN NAKED OUT OF THE MONEY PUTS AND CALLS
c29c020x MR. HART SAYS FIRST OPTIONS HASN'T SOUGHT TO REIN HIM IN
c29c020y OTHER BROKERAGE FIRMS HOWEVER HAVE CURBED OR HALTED UNHEDGED OPTIONS TRADING SINCE THE CRASH
c29c020z THE SITUATION APPEARS TO PUT THE BOARD IN A TOUGH SPOT
c29c0210 IT WAS NEVER ABLE TO COME UP WITH A FAIRNESS OPINION ON THE ORIGINAL OFFER
c29c0211 IT SAID IT COULDN'T RECOMMEND WHETHER THE COMPANY SHOULD BE SOLD AT THAT TIME OR AT WHAT PRICE
c29c0212 YESTERDAY CHARTER SAID ITS SPECIAL BOARD COMMITTEE HAD INFORMED THE GROUP THAT IT HASN'T DETERMINED WHETHER IT IS APPROPRIATE TO SELL THE COMPANY NOW EITHER
c29c0213 THE REVISED OFFER IS SUBJECT TO THE COMMITTEE'S DETERMINING THAT THE PRICE IS FAIR AMONG OTHER CONDITIONS
c29c0214 WE SAW IT WITH OIL AND WE'RE SEEING IT WITH GOLD SAYS JOHN DESSAUER AN ORLEANS MASSACHUSETTS MONEY MANAGER
c29c0215 WHEN THE PRICE GETS HIGH ENOUGH ALL THESE NEW RESERVES OPEN UP EVENTUALLY KNOCKING DOWN PRICES HE SAYS
c29c0216 HE ADDS THAT HE EXPECTS GOLD WILL SOON RETREAT TO BELOW FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS
c29c0217 THE OTHER EUROPEAN MARKETS ALSO POSTED DECLINES
c29c0218 STOCKS CLOSED LOWER IN PARIS ZURICH BRUSSELS AMSTERDAM STOCKHOLM AND MILAN
c29c0219 JOINING THE CROWD WERE SHARE PRICES IN SYDNEY WELLINGTON TAIPEI MANILA HONG KONG AND SINGAPORE
c29c021a ADVANCING ISSUES AND DECLINERS WERE NECK AND NECK YESTERDAY BUT THE HEAVIEST TRADING WAS AMONG THE ISSUES WITH RISING PRICES
c29c021b SOME FIFTY POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS AT ADVANCING PRICES COMPARED WITH THIRTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION THAT TRADED AT LOWER PRICES
c29c021c IN ALL A MODERATE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION SHARES TRADED ON NASDAQ YESTERDAY
c29c021d JIM POYNER AN ANALYST WITH RAUSCHER PIERCE REFSNES INCORPORATED IN DALLAS SAID THEY THE GROUP MAY RUN INTO SOME RESISTANCE FROM OUTSIDE SHAREHOLDERS
c29c021e THE COMPANY IS WORTH AT LEAST A FEW DOLLARS PER SHARE MORE THAN THIS
c29c021f I THINK IF ANOTHER COMPANY WERE TRYING TO BUY STERLING THEY'D HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN THIS
c29c021g AMERICAN STANDARD SAID IT IS VERY PLEASED BY BLACK AND DECKER'S WITHDRAWAL
c29c021h IT DECLINED TO ELABORATE
c29c021i IF BLACK AND DECKER SHOULD RESUME ITS PURSUIT SOURCES CLOSE TO AMERICAN STANDARD SAID THE COMPANY IS PREPARED TO RESIST AGAIN
c29c021j WHILE CAMPBELL IS CONFIDENT ITS MICROWAVE BREAKTHROUGH WILL LURE NEW CONSUMERS WHO HAVE NEVER BEFORE SAMPLED A FROZEN BREAKFAST OTHER COMPETITORS ARE WAFFLING
c29c021k WE HAVE LOOKED AT THEM MICROWAVE WAFFLES SAID A SPOKESMAN AT I. C. INDUSTRIES
c29c021l BUT OUR FEELING IS THAT THE TOASTER WAFFLES THAT YOU CAN PRODUCE IN THIRTY SECONDS ARE MORE CONVENIENT AND BETTER QUALITY
c29c021m BUT AT ANOTHER OPERATION IN RURAL NORTHERN ILLINOIS THERE ARE HARDLY ANY MINORITIES TO DRAW FROM
c29c021n WE PICKED THAT LOCATION BECAUSE WE NEEDED THE RIVER ACCESS THERE TO BE SUCCESSFUL MR. THOMPSON SAYS
c29c021o I KNOW I HAVE A SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
c29c021p BUT I ALSO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MY SHAREHOLDERS
c29c021q THE LAST STUMBLING BLOCK FOR THE BILL WAS SENATOR BRADLEY'S EFFORT TO ADD THE HOME CARE PROVISION
c29c021r AT FIRST SECRETARY BOWEN OPPOSED THE PROVISION BUT LAWMAKERS NARROWED THE BENEFIT AND LIMITED ITS COST
c29c021s THESE EFFORTS WON OVER THE REAGAN OFFICIAL WHO HAS CHAMPIONED THE LEGISLATION
c29c021t BOTH STAPLES AND OFFICE CLUB HOPE TO BE ABLE TO GO PUBLIC NEXT YEAR
c29c021u THEY AREN'T AFRAID OF LARGE DISCOUNTERS SUCH AS K. MART AND AMES
c29c021v MR. PEARLMAN THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER SAYS HISTORY HASN'T SHOWN THAT BIG RETAILERS HAVE BEEN GOOD AT SPECIALTY RETAILING
c29c021w MR. VIET HAS BIGGER WORRIES
c29c021x APART FROM UNCOOPERATIVE TARGETS THE PAPER AND ITS THIRTY TWO JOURNALISTS FACE A CHALLENGE TO BECOME MORE PROFESSIONAL HE SAYS
c29c021y CRITICIZING SHORTCOMINGS ISN'T ENOUGH
c29c021z WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE ACHIEVEMENTS
c29c0220 WE HAVE TO DEVELOP JUDGMENT AND THAT ISN'T EASY
c29c0221 IF THE SETTLEMENT IS COMPLETED THE COMPANY WOULD JOIN SHAREHOLDER PLAINTIFFS IN SEEKING DAMAGES AGAINST FOUNDER EDDIE ANTAR AND OTHERS
c29c0222 CRAZY EDDIE CURRENTLY IS A DEFENDANT IN THE HOLDERS' LITIGATION
c29c0223 THE NEW MANAGEMENT HAS ACCUSED MR. ANTAR IN COURT AND REGULATORY FILINGS OF ENGAGING IN A POSSIBLE SCHEME TO FALSIFY INVENTORY AND PROFIT REPORTS
c29c0224 INDEED NO CHANGES ARE LIKELY SOON BECAUSE THE WHOLESALERS AND SMALL RETAILERS THAT BENEFIT FROM THE EXISTING SYSTEM ARE WELL ORGANIZED BACKERS OF THE RULING LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY
c29c0225 THE JAPANESE DEBATE ON THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM BEGAN ONLY RECENTLY
c29c0226 EVEN AFTER A CONSENSUS IS REACHED NEW LEGISLATION MAY HAVE TO BE DRAFTED AND ENACTED
c29c0227 SHE SAID THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE NEW MODEL TO EXPAND THE MARKET RATHER THAN CANNIBALIZE SALES OF CONVENTIONAL MODELS
c29c0228 THE SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO CALIFORNIA COMPANY DECLINED TO PROJECT SALES FOR THE NEW MODEL
c29c0229 IN AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING YESTERDAY DIASONICS SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT TWO POINT EIGHT SEVEN FIVE DOLLARS
c29c022a IN BETWEEN THE PURCHASERS' REPORT AND THE JOBS DATA THE GOVERNMENT WILL RELEASE A HALF DOZEN OTHER SERIES INCLUDING JUNE'S LEADING ECONOMIC INDICATORS INDEX
c29c022b THAT INDEX COULD ADD TO RECESSION FEARS IF IT DECLINES AS EXPECTED
c29c022c A DROP IN THE GOVERNMENT'S CHIEF ECONOMIC FORECASTING TOOL WOULD MARK THE FOURTH DECLINE IN FIVE MONTHS
c29c022d A RULE OF THUMB AMONG ECONOMISTS HOLDS THAT THREE SUCCESSIVE DECLINES IN THE INDEX SIGNAL RECESSION
c29c022e WE ARE EXTREMELY SELECTIVE SAID PAUL SUCKOW DIRECTOR OF FIXED INCOME AT OPPENHEIMER MANAGEMENT CORPORATION
c29c022f I DON'T THINK SOME ISSUES ARE GOING TO MAKE IT HE SAID
c29c022g EVEN CAUTIOUS MANAGERS SUCH AS MR. SUCKOW ARE SEEING THE IMPACT OF THE CAMPEAU DEBACLE
c29c022h HE SAID HIS FIRM OWNS A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE FEDERATED SENIOR DEBT
c29c022i ALTHOUGH THE BONDS ARE SECURED BY BANK CREDITS THEY HAVE ALSO FALLEN IN PRICE RECENTLY
c2ac0201 A SPOKESWOMAN FOR C. B. S. SAID THERE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES AND WE'RE TRYING OUR BEST TO FIND SOLUTIONS WHILE OPERATING IN A VERY DEMANDING ECONOMIC CLIMATE
c2ac0202 WE'RE CONTINUING TO BARGAIN
c2ac0203 CAPITAL CITIES SLASH A. B. C. DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE TALKS
c2ac0204 DIVERSIFIED ENERGIES INCORPORATED COMPLETED THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF SENIOR NOTES
c2ac0207 THE PLACEMENT WAS MANAGED BY KIDDER PEABODY AND COMPANY
c2ac0208 BUT MR. MORRIS INDICATED THAT THE NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S INTERESTS APPEARED TO BE ELSEWHERE
c2ac0209 AFTER REFINANCING IS COMPLETE IMPROVING THE MARKETING OPERATIONS AT FLYING TIGER IS THE FOCAL POINT OF HIS STRATEGY AT THIS POINT MR. MORRIS SAID
c2ac020a TAX CREDITS ALSO WOULD BE USABLE IF THE AIRLINE WERE TO TURN A LARGE PROFIT HE NOTED
c2ac020b THE FOLLOWING LETTER HAS BEEN SIGNED BY ONE THOUSAND CHINESE CITIZENS WHO ARE STUDYING IN THE U. S.
c2ac020c MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY HAVE ALLOWED THEIR NAMES TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE U. S. CHINESE LANGUAGE PRESS THE REST HAVE REQUESTED ANONYMITY
c2ac020d A COPY OF THE DOCUMENT HAS BEEN DELIVERED TO THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
c2ac020e LAST OCTOBER SIX HUNDRED OF ITS ONE THOUSAND WORKERS WENT ON STRIKE AFTER THEIR CONTRACT EXPIRED
c2ac020f THE PLANTS CONTINUED TO OPERATE AT REDUCED CAPACITY DURING THE STRIKE AND A SPOKESMAN FOR THE COMPANY SAID ALL WORKERS ARE EXPECTED TO RETURN WITHIN A WEEK
c2ac020g DETAILS OF THE AGREEMENT WEREN'T DISCLOSED BUT THE SPOKESMAN SAID IT OFFERED MODEST WAGE INCREASES
c2ac020h BUYING CORPORATE ZEROS FOR AN I. R. A. NEUTRALIZES THEIR MOST OBVIOUS DISADVANTAGE THE TAX TREATMENT
c2ac020i WITH RARE EXCEPTIONS SUCH BONDS TRIGGER PERSONAL INCOME TAX EACH YEAR ON THE THEORETICAL ACCUMULATION OR ACCRETION OF INTEREST
c2ac020j THAT MEANS INVESTORS PAY TAX ON MONEY THEY HAVEN'T YET RECEIVED
c2ac020k <NOISE> IF THE BONDS ARE BOUGHT FOR AN I. R. A. HOWEVER NO TAX IS DUE UNTIL THE MONEY IS WITHDRAWN
c2ac020l THAT MAY SIGNAL THAT EQUITY LINKED EUROBONDS AREN'T GOING TO DISAPPEAR EVEN IF EQUITIES FALL OUT OF INVESTOR FAVOR
c2ac020n WE'LL JUST ADAPT THE PRODUCT
c2ac020o IT WAS A WONDERFUL DAY FOR THE BOND MARKETS SAID MICHAEL J. CONNERY THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF FINANCIAL FUTURES AT CHICAGO BASED REFCO INCORPORATED
c2ac020p ALL THE APPARENT SIGNS OF INFLATION WERE DEFLATED
c2ac020q AND THAT'S LED TO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SHORT COVERING OR TRADERS AND INVESTORS BUYING BACK SECURITIES THAT THEY BORROWED AND SOLD
c2ac020r WHATEVER WE THINK ABOUT THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT IN IRAN IT IS AMONG THE PLANET'S MOST VITAL TERRITORIES
c2ac020s OUR SHARED ENEMY HAS FIVE DIVISIONS IN IRAN'S NORTHERN BORDER
c2ac020t THIS LOOMING SOVIET PRESENCE THREATENS NOT JUST AFGHANISTAN SOUTH OF THE SOVIET UNION AND EAST OF IRAN BUT THE PERSIAN GULF
c2ac020u THE WARM WATER PORT THE CZARS DREAMED OF IS WITHIN REACH
c2ac020v WE WILL HAVE A LOT MORE THAN KUWAITI TANKERS TO WORRY ABOUT IF THE SOVIETS GET THEIR PAWS ON THE OIL SPIGOT OF WESTERN EUROPE AND JAPAN
c2ac020w IN SHORT THE FALL OF IRAN TO THE AYATOLLAH WAS BAD NEWS FOR THE WEST THE FALL OF IRAN TO THE SOVIETS WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE
c2ac020x AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THE INVESTIGATION OF MATTHEWS AND WRIGHT HAS LED TO AN UNPRECEDENTED EXAMINATION OF THE LARGELY UNREGULATED SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY BILLION DOLLAR MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET
c2ac020y THIS IN TURN HAS LED TO CALLS FROM FINANCIERS AND POLITICIANS FOR CLOSER REGULATION OF THIS HUGE MARKET
c2ac020z THE INVESTIGATION CENTERS ON WHETHER BOND ISSUES SOLD AS TAX EXEMPT BY MATTHEWS AND WRIGHT AND OTHER UNDERWRITERS ACTUALLY WARRANT TAX EXEMPT STATUS
c2ac0210 INVESTORS RANGING FROM U. S. CORPORATIONS TO JAPANESE BUYERS OF U. S. T. BILLS MUST FACTOR IN A RISK PREMIUM FOR DOLLAR VOLATILITY
c2ac0211 THUS IT IS AT LEAST PLAUSIBLE IF NOT LIKELY THAT DOLLAR VOLATILITY IS ONE REASON REAL INTEREST RATES HAVE STAYED HIGH IN THE U. S.
c2ac0212 IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT NO PLAN TO RESTORE STABILITY TO WORLD MARKETS CAN SUCCEED WITHOUT ADDRESSING DOLLAR VOLATILITY
c2ac0213 ANOTHER REASON MR. SOIFER IS AVOIDING MORGAN AND CITICORP IS THAT THEIR STOCK PRICES AT TIMES HAVE TENDED TO GYRATE MORE VIOLENTLY THAN OTHER BANK ISSUES
c2ac0214 CITICORP AND MORGAN TEND TO HAVE MORE VOLATILITY ON DAYS WHEN PROGRAM TRADING IS KNOWN TO OCCUR MR. SOIFER SAYS
c2ac0215 THEY'RE MORE OF A BET ON WHICH WAY THE MARKET IS HEADED
c2ac0216 INEVITABLY SOME WILL SEEK A FOURTH ALTERNATIVE TO CONTINUE BORROWING FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD MAKING ONLY MARGINAL ADJUSTMENTS IN OUR ECONOMIC POLICIES
c2ac0217 EARLIER THIS CENTURY THE BRITISH TAUGHT US THAT DEBT AND LEADERSHIP CANNOT LONG CO EXIST
c2ac0219 SOME MONTHS BEFORE THE CRASH INTEREST RATES STARTED TO MOVE UP
c2ac021a HOME MORTGAGE RATES WENT UP ALMOST TEN TIMES AS FAST AS THEY CAME DOWN
c2ac021b THE MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH WAS MUDDLING AT OR BELOW THE LOWER END OF THE TARGET RANGE A PHENOMENON WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED FOR MANY YEARS
c2ac021c CAMPEAU BOOSTED ITS HOSTILE OFFER FOR FEDERATED DEPARTMENT STORES TO FIVE POINT FOUR SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS AMID SIGNS OF A POSSIBLE BIDDING WAR FOR THE RETAILER
c2ac021d AT LEAST TWO MAJOR GROUPS ARE WEIGHING BIDS SOURCES SAID INCLUDING A GROUP LED BY KOHLBERG KRAVIS
c2ac021e OTHER POTENTIAL SUITORS ARE SAID TO BE DILLARD DEPARTMENT STORES AND THE DEVELOPERS ALFRED TAUBMAN AND MELVIN SIMON
c2ac021f PILLSBURY'S LOSS COMPARES WITH EARNINGS OF FORTY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OR FIFTY SIX CENTS A SHARE IN THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER
c2ac021g REVENUE FELL TWO PERCENT IN THE LATEST PERIOD TO ONE POINT FIVE OH BILLION DOLLARS FROM ONE POINT FIVE THREE BILLION DOLLARS
c2ac021h THE REVENUE DECLINE CAME FROM PILLSBURY'S RESTAURANT BUSINESS
c2ac021i AND THE AGREEMENT COMES AT A TIME WHEN THE NUMBER OF BEEF CATTLE IN THE NATION IS AT A TWENTY EIGHT YEAR LOW
c2ac021j CATTLEMEN HAVE BEEN CUTTING DOWN THEIR HERDS IN RESPONSE TO LOWER PRICES
c2ac021k WHILE PRICES BEGAN TO RISE THIS YEAR THE DROUGHT AND BANKERS' EAGERNESS TO HAVE FARM LOANS REPAID HAVE DELAYED ANY REBUILDING OF HERDS
c2ac021l I DON'T THINK ANY ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE JAPANESE AGREEMENT WILL AFFECT THAT A WHOLE LOT SAID JACK DAHL A LARGE NORTH DAKOTA RANCHER
c2ac021m STANFORD NOW CHOOSES NOT TO REQUIRE ITS UNDERGRADUATES TO STUDY THEIR WESTERN HERITAGE BUT THAT HISTORY DOES YIELD CERTAIN LESSONS
c2ac021n ONE OF THEM IS THAT MINORITIES THAT DO NOT RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO ATTACKS FROM THE MAJORITY MERELY ENCOURAGE FURTHER ASSAULTS
c2ac021o PERHAPS THE HOOVER OVERSEERS SHOULD KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN THEY PONDER THE LATEST AFFRONT TO GLENN CAMPBELL NEXT WEEK
c2ac021p SENATORIAL PRIVILEGE HAS SOLD MORE THAN SEVENTY THOUSAND COPIES DESPITE THIS MAJOR MEDIA NEGLECT OR PERHAPS BECAUSE OF IT
c2ac021q MR. DAMORE HAS GONE HAWKING THE BOOK IN THAT PARALLEL UNIVERSE OF POPULIST MEDIA OUTLETS
c2ac021r THE BOOK GOT ITS FIRST BIG PUSH FROM A SEGMENT ON A CURRENT AFFAIR THE FOX NETWORK'S TELEVISION TABLOID
c2ac021s MR. DAMORE HAS DONE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED INTERVIEWS ON TALK RADIO STATIONS
c2ac021t BANCORP HAWAII ALSO DECLARED A THREE FOR TWO STOCK SPLIT PAYABLE NOVEMBER SIXTEENTH TO STOCK OF RECORD OCTOBER TWENTY FOURTH
c2ac021u THE STOCK SPLIT WILL INCREASE THE COMPANY'S SHARES OUTSTANDING TO FOURTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION FROM NINE POINT SEVEN MILLION
c2ac021w INVESTORS ALSO PREFER REMICS BACKED BY SWAP TEN PERCENT SECURITIES BECAUSE PREPAYMENTS ARE LESS VOLATILE
c2ac021x FREDDIE MAC PASSES THROUGH ACTUAL PREPAYMENTS ON SWAP MORTGAGE ISSUES WHILE IT ESTIMATES PREPAYMENTS ON THE CASH ISSUES
c2ac021y PREPAYMENTS ON FREDDIE MAC CASH ISSUES ARE MUCH MORE VOLATILE FROM MONTH TO MONTH THAN PREPAYMENTS ON THE SWAP ISSUES
c2ac021z CHICAGO BASED J. M. B.'S FORTY NINE DOLLAR A SHARE BID FOR AMFAC HAS A TOTAL VALUE OF ABOUT NINE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS
c2ac0220 AMFAC BASED HERE IS A MAJOR OWNER OF PROPERTY IN HAWAII AND HAS INTERESTS IN WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION FOOD PROCESSING RETAILING AGRICULTURE AND RESORTS
c2ac0221 THE COMPANY DECLINED FURTHER COMMENT PENDING RELEASE OF THE PROXY MATERIALS
c2ac0222 IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE AUCTIONS ARE GOING IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN TOKYO SAID MR. PETRI OF MERRILL LYNCH
c2ac0223 NO ONE FIRM CAN DOMINATE THE AUCTION PROCESS THE WAY SALOMON USED TO
c2ac0224 THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE JAPANESE INFLUENCE
c2ac0225 THE SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICE FOR CINDERELLA IS TWENTY SIX DOLLARS AND NINETY NINE CENTS AND FOR E. T. TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS AND NINETY FIVE CENTS
c2ac0226 BUT BOTH HAVE BEEN HEAVILY DISCOUNTED BY AS MUCH AS NINE DOLLARS A CASSETTE AND BOTH HAVE REBATE OFFERS
c2ac0227 THE HOME VIDEO INDUSTRY IS HOPING THE MASSIVE PURCHASES OF BOTH CASSETTES WILL TURN MANY CASSETTE RENTERS INTO AT LEAST OCCASIONAL BUYERS IN THE FUTURE
c2ac0228 DURING THAT CAMPAIGN AS IN EARLIER ONES A FEW LOW AND MIDDLE RANKING OFFICIALS WERE ARRESTED OR DISMISSED
c2ac0229 BUT NO LEADING CADRES OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS WERE PUNISHED FUELING CYNICISM AMONG THE MASSES
c2ac022b WE GIVE A LOOK LIKE A GENERATION BEFORE THEM LIVED HERE SAID MR. MARDER
c2ac022c THAT'S WORTH MONEY
c2ac022e SALES ARE STILL UNDER TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR HE SAYS BUT THEY'RE HEADED UP
c2ac022f THE SINHALESE COMMUNITY ALSO HAS BEEN DRIVEN TO SELF DEFENSE
c2ac022g CONTRARY TO A VIEW FASHIONABLE IN MANY CIRCLES OF THE COLOMBO ELITE THE J. V. P. HAS NOT CAUSED THE PRESENT INSURGENCY
c2ac022h NEITHER CAN IT EVEN BE SAID TO BE LEADING IT IT IS RACING TO KEEP UP WITH IT
c2bc0201 ALBERT HALPRIN CHIEF OF THE F. C. C.'S COMMON CARRIER BUREAU SAID HE HADN'T SEEN THE CONSUMER GROUP'S STUDY
c2bc0202 HE SAID PREVIOUS STUDIES BY THE GROUP HAD FOCUSED ON FLAT RATE SERVICE FOR LOCAL CALLS
c2bc0203 MR. HALPRIN CONCEDED THAT SUCH RATES HAD RISEN SHARPLY BUT HE ADDED THAT PHONE COMPANIES NOW OFFER A VARIETY OF LOCAL TELEPHONE PLANS AT DIFFERING PRICES
c2bc0204 THE DEPARTMENT EXPECTS A TWO PERCENT RISE IN THE MEDIAN VALUE OF INDUSTRY SHIPMENTS NEXT YEAR AFTER INFLATION ADJUSTMENT
c2bc0205 AMONG SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES THE DEPARTMENT EXPECTS HIGH TECHNOLOGY CONCERNS TO LEAD THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR
c2bc0206 SHIPMENTS FOR THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY ARE SEEN GROWING TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT
c2bc0207 OTHER FAST GROWING INDUSTRIES INCLUDE ELECTRONIC CAPACITORS OPTICAL DEVICES AND LENSES X. RAY EQUIPMENT AND MISSILES AND SPACE VEHICLES
c2bc0208 PAYOFFS TO MOSCOW BY THE WEST COULD RANGE FROM SOFTENING HUMAN RIGHTS POLICIES TO EXTENDING CHEAP LOANS TO RELAXING TECHNOLOGY CONTROLS
c2bc0209 THE AVAILABLE SOVIET INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE ITS NORTH SEA NAVY ITS MOBILE ARMORED FORCES IN CENTRAL EUROPE AND ITS ARRAY OF CONVENTIONALLY ARMED TACTICAL MISSILES
c2bc020a WHETHER SUCH BLACKMAIL WOULD EVER BE SENSIBLE OR POSSIBLE IS ARGUABLE BUT OFFICIALS LIKE MR. ABSHIRE DON'T WANT MOSCOW TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRY
c2bc020b I WAS STARTLED STARTLED ISN'T THE WORD REACTED ALVIN NOVICK A BIOLOGY PROFESSOR AT YALE UNIVERSITY
c2bc020c HE WARNED THAT FORCED TESTING SUCH AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE CENTERS WOULD DRIVE HOMOSEXUALS UNDERGROUND AND AWAY FROM COOPERATION WITH PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS
c2bc020d RATIONAL PEOPLE WON'T COOPERATE IN RUINING THEIR OWN LIVES HE SAID
c2bc020e IN THE FEBRUARY TWENTY SECOND ACCORD THE U. S. AND ITS ALLIES ASSERTED THAT THE DOLLAR HAD DECLINED ENOUGH
c2bc020f THEY PLEDGED TO INTERVENE JOINTLY IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS TO KEEP EXCHANGE RATES AT ABOUT THEIR CURRENT LEVELS
c2bc020g THE DOLLAR REMAINED STABLE FOR ABOUT FOUR WEEKS AFTER THE ACCORD WAS REACHED BUT THEN BEGAN TO SLUMP AGAINST THE JAPANESE YEN
c2bc020h CENTRAL BANKS INTERVENED AND EVENTUALLY HELPED ARREST THE SLIDE
c2bc020i MR. BOTHA ALSO MUST RULE ON THE FATE OF THE GROUP AREAS ACT
c2bc020j VIOLATIONS OF THE ACT ARE RAMPANT BUT THERE WERE ONLY FOUR PROSECUTIONS UNDER IT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX ONE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND NONE THE YEAR BEFORE
c2bc020k A RECENT POLL BY THE AFRIKAANS NEWSPAPER RAPPORT FOUND THAT ONLY TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF SURVEYED WHITES WANT THE ACT RETAINED
c2bc020l MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR PERCENT WANT IT SCRAPPED COMPLETELY WHILE ANOTHER THIRTY FOUR PERCENT WANT EACH LOCAL COMMUNITY OR PROPERTY OWNER TO DECIDE WHO CAN RENT OR BUY HOUSING
c2bc020m J. P.
c2bc020n MORGAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A HERO OF MINE MR. FARKAS SAYS
c2bc020o <NOISE> OF COURSE HE QUICKLY ADDS I DON'T SEE MYSELF AS A ROBBER BARON IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM
c2bc020p ON THE BIG BOARD VOLUME ROSE TO TWO HUNDRED TWENTY POINT FIVE MILLION SHARES FROM ONE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION THURSDAY
c2bc020q BUT THE ACTIVITY WAS LESS THAN ON PREVIOUS TRIPLE WITCHING DAYS AND MUCH OF THE TRADING WAS PACKED INTO THE OPENING AND CLOSING MINUTES OF THE SESSION
c2bc020r MORE THAN THIRTY ONE MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS IN THE FINAL MINUTE
c2bc020s THE IRAN CONTRA PANEL'S BIG SCENE GOT OFF WITH A BANG YESTERDAY
c2bc020t LIEUTENANT COLONEL OLLIE NORTH WAS SWORN IN AND BRENDAN SULLIVAN JUNIOR HIS LAWYER PROMPTLY SET OUT TO PROVE THAT WITNESSES CAN TALK BACK AT A CONGRESSIONAL HEARING
c2bc020u HE ACCUSED THE COMMITTEE OF WORKING HAND IN GLOVE WITH THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR THREATENING TO INDICT HIS CLIENT AND USING DIRTY TRICKS BESIDES
c2bc020v MR. CAO HASN'T LOOKED BACK
c2bc020w HE MAKES TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A YEAR PRODUCING HIS BUG ART ABOUT EIGHT TIMES THE AVERAGE CHINESE INCOME
c2bc020x AND HIS SUCCESS HAS SPAWNED IMITATORS SOME OF WHOM ARE NOW ALSO SELLING THEIR WARES THROUGH THE FRIENDSHIP STORE
c2bc020y IN TAMPA A JIM WALTER SPOKESMAN WOULDN'T DISCUSS THE MATTER
c2bc020z PEOPLE CAN SAY WHAT THEY WANT BUT WE DON'T COMMENT HE SAID
c2bc0210 MR. WALTER HIMSELF AND OTHER TOP EXECUTIVES DIDN'T RETURN PHONE CALLS
c2bc0211 HE ALSO RELIED HEAVILY ON ADVERTISING RATHER THAN ON DIRECT MAILING WHICH IS BY FAR THE MOST COMMON WAY FOR NEWSLETTER PUBLISHERS TO SOLICIT SUBSCRIBERS
c2bc0212 THIS UNUSUAL STRATEGY EVOLVED FROM A SMALL AD PLACED IN A BUSINESS MAGAZINE
c2bc0213 THE NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR AD GENERATED ENOUGH SUBSCRIPTIONS TO PAY FOR ITSELF IN A WEEK SO MR. KOBREN BEGAN ADVERTISING IN OTHER PUBLICATIONS
c2bc0214 OF HIS COMPANY'S ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN OPERATING EXPENSES LAST YEAR FULLY HALF WENT FOR MARKETING
c2bc0215 UNDER THE PLAN THE EDELMAN GROUP WOULD CONTRIBUTE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN EQUITY TO THE TRANSACTION
c2bc0216 THE REMAINDER WOULD BE FINANCED WITH DEBT AND DEBT SECURITIES
c2bc0217 IF THE PLAN SUCCEEDS SHEARSON WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE WARRANTS TO BUY TEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT OF THE FULLY DILUTED COMMON EQUITY OF THE COMPANY
c2bc0218 THE HUGE GAP TO A LARGE EXTENT IS A PRICE PHENOMENON
c2bc0219 THE DOLLAR'S FALL HAS PUSHED UP THE PRICE OF IMPORTS CAUSING THE DEFICIT TO SWELL EVEN AS THE VOLUME OF NON OIL IMPORTS HAS RECEDED
c2bc021a BUT LONG BEFORE NOW THESE HIGHER PRICES WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT IN THE MONTHLY MERCHANDISE TRADE DEFICIT AS WELL
c2bc021b IN INTERVIEWS AND SPEECHES MR. ROH HAS SHOWN A GOOD GRASP OF THE ISSUES KOREA'S NEXT PRESIDENT FACES
c2bc021c HE TAKES NORTH KOREA FOR THE SERIOUS THREAT THAT IT IS
c2bc021d NATIONAL SECURITY IS A BIG CONCERN FOR SOUTH KOREANS AND IF THEY THINK MR. ROH CAN BEST PROVIDE IT THAT'S A PERFECTLY GOOD REASON TO VOTE FOR HIM
c2bc021e MR. ROH ALSO FAVORS A FREER ECONOMY TO KEEP SOUTH KOREAN DEVELOPMENT ROLLING
c2bc021f IN DECEMBER AUTO LOANS INCREASED BY TWO POINT FIVE TWO BILLION DOLLARS OR AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF ELEVEN POINT SEVEN PERCENT
c2bc021g CREDIT CARD BORROWING SOARED BY TWO POINT THREE TWO BILLION DOLLARS OR AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF NINETEEN POINT FOUR PERCENT
c2bc021h A FED ECONOMIST SUGGESTED THIS LARGE INCREASE MAY REFLECT SLOWER GROWTH EARLIER IN THE YEAR AS CONSUMERS USED HOME EQUITY LOANS TO PAY OFF CREDIT CARD BALANCES
c2bc021i ALL THE INCREASES ARE SEASONALLY ADJUSTED
c2bc021j THE ORDER CARRIED OUT THE SHIP TAKES OFF AT FLANK SPEED FROM THE BARENTS HEADED SOUTH TO AVOID DETECTION
c2bc021k THEN INEXPLICABLY A FEW HOURS LATER ALL COMMUNICATION VANISHES
c2bc021l NONE WITH WASHINGTON NONE WITH OTHER SHIPS NO SIGNALS FROM THE USUAL COMMERCIAL STATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD
c2bc021m FOR AUTHORS AND PUBLISHERS A NEW COMPETITOR IN THE BOOK CLUB FIELD IS A GODSEND
c2bc021n BOOK CLUB RIGHTS ARE SECOND ONLY TO PAPERBACK RIGHTS IN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL REVENUE FOR PUBLISHERS
c2bc021o FURTHERMORE A BOOK CLUB IMPRIMATUR ON A BOOK GIVES IT ENORMOUS CACHET WITH BOOKSTORE MANAGERS
c2bc021p AGE DISCRIMINATION IS OFTEN THE BASIS FOR LEGAL ACTION BY AN EMPLOYEE AGAINST HIS FORMER COMPANY
c2bc021q WHEN A MAJOR NATIONAL RETAILER WENT THROUGH A COST CUTTING PERIOD A NUMBER OF OLDER EXECUTIVES WERE DISCHARGED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE CONSOLIDATION OF DEPARTMENTS
c2bc021r THESE EXECUTIVES BANDED TOGETHER AND INSTITUTED A CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST THE FORMER EMPLOYER
c2bc021s A VERY SIMILAR CASE OCCURRED WITH ANOTHER NATIONAL RETAILER THAT SOUGHT TO REDUCE ITS OVERHEAD AND OPERATING EXPENSES
c2bc021t ANOTHER LARGE CLASS ACTION SUIT ALSO BASED ON THE CHARGE OF AGE DISCRIMINATION IS PENDING AGAINST A LEADING MIDWESTERN BANK
c2bc021u WOMEN ON THE JOB LONG FOR THE FAMILY DINNER A SURVEY OF FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY CAREER WOMEN BY THE MAGAZINE WORKING WOMAN SHOWS
c2bc021v WHILE SIXTY ONE PERCENT BUY FANCY TAKEOUT FOODS HALF FEEL GUILTY THAT THEY DON'T COOK AND SERVE HOME MEALS TO THEIR FAMILIES
c2bc021w FULLY EIGHTY ONE PERCENT OF THOSE WITH PRE ADOLESCENT CHILDREN TRY TO RE CREATE THE DINNER TABLE OF THEIR OWN YOUTH
c2bc021x BUT MR. PARCHER IS ALSO CONSIDERED ABRASIVE AT TIMES
c2bc021y HE RUBS SOME PEOPLE WRONG SAYS LEONARD MARKS WHO HAS TRIED CASES AGAINST HIM
c2bc021z HE'S VERY OUTSPOKEN
c2bc0220 IN THE NEW CONSUMERIST CHILE THIS IS A MAN WHO DOESN'T EVEN OWN A CAR
c2bc0221 THE SON OF A RETIRED AIR FORCE OFFICER HE LIVES QUIETLY WITH HIS WIFE AND TWO DAUGHTERS IN A SMALL HOUSE IN SANTIAGO
c2bc0222 HE PREFERS THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN TO THE WEEKLY NEWS MAGAZINES
c2bc0223 HIS TRAINING WAS AS A MINING ENGINEER NOT AS AN ECONOMIST
c2bc0224 AMONG HIS RECENT READING THE EYE OF THE FLY
c2bc0225 THE INDICTMENTS ALLEGE THAT MESSRS.
c2bc0226 MARTINO AND ORLOFF APPROVED MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR WORK DONE LARGELY BY HANLEY WORLDWIDE
c2bc0227 THEY RECEIVED PAYMENTS IN CASH AND IN THE FORM OF CLOTHES CLUB MEMBERSHIP AND PAYMENT OF PERSONAL BILLS ACCORDING TO THE CHARGES
c2bc0228 DESPITE THE PROBLEMS WITH THE CLARIDGE MR. WYNN DIDN'T RULE OUT AN EVENTUAL RETURN TO THE ATLANTIC CITY GAMBLING SCENE
c2bc0229 IT'S DISAPPOINTING HE SAID OF THE FAILED PROPOSAL
c2bc022a BUT THIS IS A VERY LIVELY MARKET AND WE HAVEN'T GIVEN UP YET
c2bc022b NOW HIS LAUGHTER IS GONE
c2bc022c BECAUSE OF DRUGS HE IS DEAD
c2bc022d AND EVERY DAY MY HEART BREAKS A LITTLE MORE
c2bc022e A SPOKESWOMAN FOR ASHLAND SAID WE HAVE BEEN OUTRAGED BY THIS ENTIRE INCIDENT
c2bc022f COMPANY OFFICIALS NOTIFIED FEDERAL AUTHORITIES TWO YEARS AGO THAT THE IRANIANS HAD ACCESS TO THE DOCUMENTS AND REQUESTED AN INVESTIGATION
c2bc022g ASHLAND WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN OF MR. ATKINS'S INVOLVEMENT THE SPOKESWOMAN SAID
c2cc0201 HIS VEHICLE WILL BE METROMEDIA COMPANY THE GENERAL PARTNERSHIP THAT WAS FORMED IN NOVEMBER TO REPLACE THE LIQUIDATED METROMEDIA INCORPORATED WHICH MR. KLUGE OWNED MOST OF
c2cc0202 THE PARTNERSHIP IS SUBSTANTIALLY DOMINATED BY MR. KLUGE AND INCLUDES ONLY ONE OTHER PARTNER STUART SUBOTNICK MR. KLUGE'S LONGTIME ASSOCIATE
c2cc0203 THE TWO ARE NOW SCANNING THE WORLD FOR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES MR. KLUGE SAYS AND HOPE TO MAKE SOME NEW INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS BY NEXT YEAR
c2cc0204 DELTA IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE THAT IT WILL BECOME THE NEW OFFICIAL CARRIER FOR WALT DISNEY WORLD IN ORLANDO FLORIDA
c2cc0205 THE AIRLINE IS CALLING TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT THE MOST IMPORTANT MARKETING ENDEAVOR IN DELTA'S RECENT HISTORY
c2cc0206 FOR RIVAL EASTERN AIRLINES A UNIT OF TEXAS AIR CORPORATION IT MAY BE YET ANOTHER LOSS OF PRESTIGE
c2cc0207 HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
c2cc0208 TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
c2cc0209 THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
c2cc020a WITH THIS BROADENED INTEREST GOLD MAY NOW HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR MUCH GREATER LONG TERM PRICE APPRECIATION THAN HISTORICAL GUIDELINES SUGGEST SOME MARKET SPECIALISTS SAY
c2cc020b MR. NICHOLS COMPARES THE SITUATION TO A THEATER
c2cc020c IN NINETEEN EIGHTY HE SAYS ONLY THE FRONT ROW OF SEATS WAS OCCUPIED
c2cc020d NOW THE THEATER IS MORE THAN HALF FULL AND HE EXPECTS A LOT OF HUSTLE AND BUSTLE IF A GOLD BUYING SPREE DEVELOPS
c2cc020e I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT
c2cc020f HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY SERIOUS THOUGHT TO DIVERSIFYING
c2cc020g MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE A VARIETY OF HOLDINGS IN YOUR PORTFOLIO
c2cc020h OR PERHAPS YOU SHOULD LIMIT YOUR EXPOSURE BY HEDGING
c2cc020i YOU COULD MAKE A PLAY ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS DEAL I SUGGESTED EARNESTLY
c2cc020j THOUGH THERE ISN'T A CURE FOR AIDS PROPONENTS ARGUE THAT THOSE WHO TEST POSITIVE CAN BE OFFERED TREATMENTS TO PROLONG THEIR LIVES
c2cc020k FOR INSTANCE THEY CAN TAKE MEDICATION TO PREVENT CATCHING THE KIND OF PNEUMONIA THAT MOST COMMONLY LEADS TO THE DEATH OF AIDS SUFFERERS
c2cc020l AND THOSE WHO HAVE NOT YET DEVELOPED AIDS CAN TAKE STEPS TO GUARD AGAINST OTHER DISEASES SUCH AS HERPES AND HEPATITIS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO ACCELERATE ITS ONSET
c2cc020m WHILE THE U. S. FOCUSES ON THE IRAN CONTRA HEARINGS MORE SOVIET ARMS FLOW INTO NICARAGUA
c2cc020n MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF WEAPONS WERE DELIVERED TO THE SANDINISTAS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR ACCORDING TO U. S. INTELLIGENCE
c2cc020o THAT'S ABOUT NINE TIMES THE DIRECT U. S. MILITARY AID PROVIDED TO THE CONTRAS IN THAT PERIOD
c2cc020p THE SOVIET EQUIPMENT IS JUST POURING IN ONE RANKING PENTAGON OFFICIAL TOLD THE A. P.
c2cc020q THE NICARAGUANS ARE CONSOLIDATING THEIR MILITARY BUILDUP AND ADDING TO IT EVERYTHING IMAGINABLE
c2cc020r IN REACTION TO THE NEWS INTEREST RATES PLUNGED THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR FIRMED AND ANALYSTS PREDICTED STOCKS WOULD MOVE HIGHER
c2cc020s BUT WHILE THE BUDGET GAVE A BOOST TO THE MARKETS IT ALSO PRESAGED GREATER AUSTERITY FOR THE NATION AS A WHOLE
c2cc020t TO MR. HAWKE THAT IS AS IT SHOULD BE
c2cc020u AUSTRALIANS HAVE GOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE AREN'T OUT OF THE WOODS YET HE SAYS
c2cc020v WE'VE GOT ENORMOUS PROBLEMS AND WE HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE WITHIN OUR RESOURCES
c2cc020w LONDON'S FINANCIAL TIMES THIRTY SHARE INDEX ROSE THIRTEEN POINT FOUR TO ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX POINT NINE
c2cc020x THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX ROSE FIFTEEN POINT SEVEN TO TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE POINT FIVE
c2cc020y IT HAD BEEN UP AS MUCH AS TWENTY EIGHT POINT ONE IN LATE MORNING
c2cc020z THE GOLD MINES INDEX FELL FOUR POINT SIX TO FOUR HUNDRED FORTY FIVE POINT EIGHT
c2cc0210 VOLUME WAS SIX HUNDRED NINETY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES COMPARED WITH FIVE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION WEDNESDAY
c2cc0211 REPUBLICANS CANNOT EXPECT TO CHANGE BLACK VOTING PATTERNS OVERNIGHT ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE FILTER OF MYTH AND FALSE ACCUSATION THEY WILL HAVE TO SEND THEIR MESSAGE THROUGH
c2cc0212 BUT THEY CAN DO MUCH BETTER THAN THEY'VE DONE IF THEY'RE WILLING TO MAKE THE EFFORT CLARENCE THOMAS AND OTHER BLACK REPUBLICANS DESCRIBE
c2cc0213 A GOOD PLACE TO START IS THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT CAMPAIGN
c2cc0214 IN NEW YORK THE MARKET ROUT HAS PUT SELLERS UNDER MORE PRESSURE
c2cc0215 FOR EXAMPLE AN EXECUTIVE IN THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY RECENTLY TURNED DOWN A TWO MILLION DOLLAR OFFER ON HIS WEST SIDE COOPERATIVE APARTMENT AS BEING TOO LOW
c2cc0216 YESTERDAY HE HURRIEDLY CALLED HIS BROKER S. W. BIRD AND COMPANY TO SAY HE WOULD ACCEPT THE BID IF IT WAS STILL OFFERED
c2cc0217 BUT FOR MOST MUTUAL FUND INVESTORS THE TAX BITE THIS YEAR WILL BE BIGGER THAN EVER
c2cc0218 HOLDERS ARE TAXED ON ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS UNDER THE NEW TAX LAW FOR INSTANCE
c2cc0219 PREVIOUSLY SIXTY PERCENT WAS EXCLUDED FROM TAXATION
c2cc021a ANY GAIN CREDITED TO INVESTORS BY THEIR FUND IS CONSIDERED REALIZED WHETHER THE HOLDER ACTUALLY SELLS ANY FUND SHARES OR NOT
c2cc021b THE SUN BELT FORECAST PARTLY CLOUDY
c2cc021c ECONOMISTS EXPECT THE SOUTHEAST BUFFERED BY ITS BIG SERVICE ECONOMY TO CONTINUE TO OUTPERFORM THE NATION
c2cc021d BUT SOME OVERBUILT REAL ESTATE MARKETS COULD GET BASHED AND FLORIDA'S INFLUX OF RETIREES JOB SEEKERS AND TOURISTS COULD DWINDLE
c2cc021e CHRYSLER CORPORATION HAS EXTENDED HOLIDAYS AT FOUR PLANTS AND IN SOME CASES INDEFINITELY SLOWED PRODUCTION
c2cc021f A TOTAL OF TEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED WORKERS ARE AFFECTED
c2cc021g AND CHAIRMAN LEE A. IACOCCA SAYS CHRYSLER WILL ANNOUNCE A PERMANENT PLANT CLOSING EARLY THIS YEAR
c2cc021h SO FAR WE'VE FOUND THAT FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HAVE DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF SENSITIVITY AND COMMON SENSE MRS. HORNER SAID
c2cc021i BUT THERE IS A NEED FOR CLARITY
c2cc021j THESE GUIDELINES WILL SERVE AS REASSURANCE TO OUR MANAGERS
c2cc021k SOME WONDER WHETHER ALL THE CONVERSIONS DON'T MAKE MR. BEREGOVOY MORE OF AN OPPORTUNIST THAN A BELIEVER IN THE MARKET ECONOMY
c2cc021l BUT HIS AIDES SAY HE WAS CONVINCED THAT HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING
c2cc021m MR. BEREGOVOY SAID I'M NOT ASHAMED OF WHAT I DO
c2cc021n THE ONLY NEW ISSUE PRICED YESTERDAY WAS FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF TWELVE YEAR SENIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES FROM U. S. G. CORPORATION
c2cc021o THE HIGH RISK HIGH YIELD ISSUE WAS PRICED AT PAR TO YIELD THIRTEEN AND ONE QUARTER PERCENT BY SALOMON BROTHERS INCORPORATED AND GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY
c2cc021p THE OFFERING IS PART OF U. S. G.'S RECAPITALIZATION PLAN
c2cc021q THE SEEDS OF NATWEST'S INVESTMENT BANKING PROBLEMS WERE SOWN MONTHS BEFORE THE DEREGULATION OF BRITAIN'S FINANCIAL MARKETS
c2cc021r RIVALS SUCH AS BARCLAYS AND S. G. WARBURG GROUP P. L. C. ASSEMBLED POWERHOUSE CONGLOMERATES OF BROKERAGE TRADING AND FIXED INCOME SECURITIES FIRMS
c2cc021s BUT NATWEST THEN PUSHING TO DISLODGE BARCLAYS AS BRITAIN'S TOP COMMERCIAL BANK WAS MORE RELUCTANT TO COMMIT ITSELF TO A SIMILAR POSITION IN INVESTMENT BANKING
c2cc021t I HAVE NEVER SOUGHT EITHER WILLFULLY OR OTHERWISE TO EVADE INCOME TAX MR. SEOW SAID
c2cc021v HE REPEATED HIS VOW TO STAND FOR PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS EXPECTED LATER THIS YEAR
c2cc021w I JUST CHECKED THIS MORNING HE SAID
c2cc021x BIDS WERE DOWN A QUARTER TO HALF A POINT AND I'M TOLD THEY'RE NOW STARTING TO COME BACK
c2cc021y IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL
c2cc021z VOLUME IS NO DIFFERENT
c2cc0220 THE MARKET HASN'T CHANGED CHARACTER
c2cc0221 SO FAR FROM A MARKET VIEWPOINT IT DOESN'T LOOK TO BE MUCH OF AN EVENT
c2cc0222 AS A RESULT THE SEQUOIA WON'T BE GOING BACK TO THE U. S. NAVY THIS YEAR
c2cc0223 OR PERHAPS ANY YEAR
c2cc0224 AND THE SHIP WHICH WAS USED BY EIGHT U. S. PRESIDENTS MIGHT EVEN GO UNDER
c2cc0225 JACKSON DEMOCRATS SEE MR. JACKSON AS AN ACTIVIST STRONG LEADER WHO IS MORE WILLING TO TAKE RISKS THAN THOSE IN THE OFTEN BLANDER CONGRESSIONAL WING OF THE PARTY
c2cc0226 HE CLEARLY COMMANDS THE DEMOCRATS' MOST LOYAL CONSTITUENCY
c2cc0227 IT IS NEVER WISE TO IGNORE THOSE YOU CAN DEPEND ON SAYS SONIA JARVIS OF THE NATIONAL COALITION ON BLACK VOTER PARTICIPATION
c2cc0228 AND SAYS MR. WAGNER IT WORKS
c2cc0229 I'M OPTIMISTIC
c2cc022a IT'S GETTING BETTER FOR GAYS AND LESBIANS
c2cc022b IF YOU'D TOLD ME TEN YEARS AGO I'D BE CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TODAY I WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED YOU
c2cc022c ONE NEW DIRECTORATE MEMBER ISN'T LIKELY TO CHANGE BUNDESBANK POLICY
c2cc022d BUT BUNDESBANK WATCHERS EXPECT MR. TIETMEYER TO SIDE WITH MR. POEHL'S MONETARY POLICIES WHICH EMPHASIZE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION OVER UNILATERAL ACTIONS
c2cc022e OTHER COUNCIL MEMBERS HAVE FREQUENTLY CLASHED WITH MR. POEHL OVER HIS EFFORT TO COORDINATE WEST GERMAN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE MOVES WITH OTHER CENTRAL BANKS
c2dc0201 HIS VEHICLE WILL BE METROMEDIA COMPANY THE GENERAL PARTNERSHIP THAT WAS FORMED IN NOVEMBER TO REPLACE THE LIQUIDATED METROMEDIA INCORPORATED WHICH MR. KLUGE OWNED MOST OF
