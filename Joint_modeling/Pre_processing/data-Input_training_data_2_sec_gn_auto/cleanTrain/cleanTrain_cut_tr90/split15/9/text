c1bc020b THAT BILL WOULD PROVIDE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AUTHORIZATION LEVELS FOR TWO YEARS AND FEWER PROGRAM CHANGES
c1bc020c IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BY ITS SPONSORS AS A HOUSEKEEPING BILL DESIGNED TO GIVE LAWMAKERS MORE TIME TO DEBATE THE THRUST OF THE NATION'S HOUSING PROGRAMS
c1bc020d NOTES FROM THE FRONT THE SAME BROKER PUT ME ON HOLD EARLY IN THE PHONE CALL
c1bc020e I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT HE SAID THIRTY SECONDS LATER
c1bc020f THE GOLD MARKET WAS JUST CLOSING
c1bc020g I HAD TO PUT AN ORDER IN
c1bc020h WHILE OTHER OPEC MEMBERS RECOGNIZE THE ADVANTAGE OF GOING DOWNSTREAM MOST LACK KUWAIT'S MONEY SMALL POPULATION AND ABILITY TO MOVE FAST
c1bc020i WE CAN'T ARGUE THAT STRONGLY FOR SPENDING BILLIONS ABROAD TO BUY DOWNSTREAM FACILITIES SAYS A VENEZUELAN OIL OFFICIAL
c1bc020j OUR PEOPLE ARE STILL HUNGRY AND OUR DOMESTIC ECONOMY NEEDS THE MONEY MORE
c1bc020k IN THE CAREFREE DAYS BEFORE DEREGULATION IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT FIVE BIG AIRLINES HANDLED MOST OF THE PASSENGER TRAFFIC IN AND OUT OF LAMBERT STREET
c1bc020l LOUIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
c1bc020m THEN CAME THE AIR WARS
c1bc020n AFTER DECONTROL NINE MORE AIRLINES INVADED THE MARKET ALL TRYING TO LURE A SHARE OF THE TWENTY MILLION TRAVELERS WHO USE THIS AIRPORT EACH YEAR
c1bc020o MR. BEENEY THEN SUBPOENAED THE LIQUIDATOR DEMANDING THE FILES
c1bc020p IN A LETTER TO MR. WIENER HE SAID HE WAS SERVING THE SUBPOENA ON BEHALF OF DOCTOR WYNYARD WHOM HE IDENTIFIED AS THE EXECUTOR OF HIS FATHER'S ESTATE
c1bc020q MR. WIENER SAID IN HIS AFFIDAVIT THAT MR. BEENEY ALSO ASSURED HIM THE FILES WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO LAWYERS FOR THE OTHER SIDE
c1bc020r SIGNS OF CHANGE ARE EVERYWHERE
c1bc020s ALTHOUGH FEW FIRMS ADMIT TO STAFF CUTS MANY ARE QUIETLY PRUNING THEIR RANKS
c1bc020t MANY HAVE SHIFTED THEIR SPECIALISTS IN TAX EXEMPT HOUSING BONDS WHERE ACTIVITY IS PARTICULARLY LOW TO THEIR MORTGAGE BACKED BOND OPERATIONS
c1bc020u COMPUTER MAKERS AND THE CUSTOMS SERVICE DISAGREE OVER HOW MOTHER BOARDS WERE PREVIOUSLY TREATED FOR TARIFF PURPOSES
c1bc020v THE CUSTOMS SERVICE SAYS THE INTEL RULING ONLY REAFFIRMED LONGTIME TARIFF POLICY AND DIDN'T REPRESENT A CHANGE
c1bc020w BUT THE TRADE GROUP SAYS IT HAS EVIDENCE GOING BACK FOR FIFTEEN YEARS THAT THE BOARDS HAVE BEEN LEVIED AS PARTS NOT COMPUTERS
c1bc020x BUT FIRST CITY WOUND UP MAKING LOANS TO SOME OF THE MOST TROUBLED ENERGY CONCERNS IN TEXAS
c1bc020y IT CONCENTRATED MORE THAN A THIRD OF ITS ENERGY LENDING IN THE ROLLERCOASTER FORTUNES OF SERVICE AND DRILLING COMPANIES
c1bc020z WHEN THE ENERGY INDUSTRY WAS GROWING THE LOANS WERE HIGHLY PROFITABLE OFTEN YIELDING TWO OR THREE POINTS OVER THE PRIME RATE
c1bc0210 BUT WHEN OIL PRICES FELL IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO AND EXPLORATION SLOWED THESE COMPANIES SOME OF THEM YOUNG AND HIGHLY LEVERAGED QUICKLY RAN INTO PROBLEMS
c1bc0211 MR. ANTONIU'S FALL AND SURPRISING REBOUND PROVE THERE IS LIFE AFTER INSIDER TRADING
c1bc0212 BUT HIS STORY ALSO SUGGESTS THAT SOME CHARACTER TRAITS THAT MAY GIVE RISE TO INSIDER TRADING CAN BE HARD TO CHANGE
c1bc0213 INSIDER TRADING IS A FORM OF FRAUD AND SOME SPORT ABOUT FRANCHISEES NOW CLAIM THEY HAVE BEEN DEFRAUDED BY MR. ANTONIU
c1bc0214 MOST FINANCIAL MARKETS REACTED COOLLY TO FRIDAY'S DEFICIT AGREEMENT
c1bc0215 THE DOLLAR AND BOND PRICES FELL WHILE STOCKS EDGED HIGHER IN THE FINAL HOUR OF TRADING
c1bc0216 THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS CLOSED UP NINE POINT FOUR FIVE AT ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE POINT OH EIGHT
c1bc0217 FOREIGN STOCK MARKETS GENERALLY GAINED
c1bc0218 CONSIDER UNITED AIRLINES ONE OF THE I. B. M. NINE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY'S FIRST CUSTOMERS
c1bc0219 IT BOUGHT THE MACHINE FOR A NEW SYSTEM TO LINK ITS RESERVATIONS COMPUTER WITH TRAVEL AGENTS
c1bc021a BUT THE SYSTEM UNITED UNVEILED THIS MONTH HAD I. B. M. PERSONAL COMPUTERS DOING SOME TASKS ORIGINALLY EARMARKED FOR THE NINE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY
c1bc021b UNITED SAYS IT HAS BEEN BUYING NINE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTIES MORE SLOWLY THAN IT ORIGINALLY PLANNED
c1bc021c I THINK THE MARKET JUMPED THE GUN ON THE NOTION OF A WEAK ECONOMY AND THE FED EASING MR. FINE SAID
c1bc021d SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS A CONSOLIDATION
c1bc021e HE EXPECTS LONG TERM TREASURY BOND YIELDS TO HOVER AROUND THE EIGHT AND ONE HALF PERCENT LEVEL IN THE NEAR FUTURE
c1bc021f WHILE FORMER EXECUTIVE BRANCH OFFICIALS FACE JAIL FOR NON CRIMES CONGRESS IS ABUSING THE JUDICIAL PROCESS IN SEEKING IMMUNITY FROM LIBEL SUITS
c1bc021g THE U. S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D. C. CIRCUIT HELD LAST NOVEMBER THAT CONGRESSMEN CAN BE SUED FOR STATEMENTS MADE OUTSIDE CONGRESS
c1bc021h LAWYER STEVEN ROSS WHOSE BOSS IS HOUSE SPEAKER JIM WRIGHT APPEALED TO THE ENTIRE CIRCUIT WITH NO SUCCESS
c1bc021i BUT ROBERT BORK HAS LEFT THE COURT SO MR. ROSS WILL TRY AGAIN
c1bc021j THE CIRCUIT HAS NEVER GRANTED A SECOND TRY BUT MR. ROSS SEEMS TO THINK IT'S WORTH ANOTHER SHOT
c1bc021k TEMPORARY PART TIME AND CONTRACT WORKERS NOW MAKE UP NEARLY ONE THIRD OF THE U. S. WORK FORCE
c1bc021l THE INCREASING DEMAND FOR THEIR SERVICES STEMS FROM CORPORATE EFFORTS TO KEEP FULL TIME STAFFS AS LEAN AS POSSIBLE
c1bc021m WHEN BUSINESS TURNS UP COMPANIES CAN HIRE TEMPORARY WORKERS WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY FULL TIME SALARIES AND BENEFITS
c1bc021n AND WHEN BUSINESS TURNS DOWN COMPANIES CAN AVOID FIRING FULL TIME STAFF
c1bc021o FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S THE BAFFLING CASE OF A YOUNG CHILD WHO SIMPLY STOPPED GROWING FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
c1bc021p DOCTORS COULDN'T IDENTIFY A MEDICAL REASON
c1bc021q THE TENTATIVE DIAGNOSIS HERE STRESS
c1bc021r SENSING THE FAMILY AS WHOLE UNDER PRESSURE THE CHILD HAD BECOME AN EMOTIONAL CARETAKER TO THE PARENTS
c1bc021s FELDMUEHLE SHARES ROSE SIXTEEN MARKS YESTERDAY ON FRANKFURT'S STOCK EXCHANGE TO THREE HUNDRED NINE POINT FIVE MARKS
c1bc021t BROKERS CITED STRONG FOREIGN DEMAND WHICH DROVE UP TRADING IN FELDMUEHLE TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SHARES NEARLY FOUR TIMES RECENT LEVELS
c1bc021u BUT THE BROKERS SAID THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE ONLY ONE PARTY WAS ACCUMULATING MOST OF THE SHARES
c1bc021v OIL CHANGE CENTERS NUMBERED ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN FRANCHISED UNITS AT THE END OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
c1bc021w THAT'S EXPECTED TO DOUBLE BY YEAR END WITH REVENUE REACHING SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES
c1bc021x JIFFY LUBE INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED BALTIMORE IS THE LEADER WITH EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY UNITS BUT COMPETITION IS BREWING AS OTHER FIRMS LOOK TO EXPAND
c1bc021y THESE INCLUDE SOME MAJOR OIL COMPANIES INTERESTED IN BRAND AWARENESS
c1bc021z MS. LIU HAD HER FIRST CHILD A BOY TWO YEARS AGO
c1bc0220 SHE WAS URGED NOT TO HAVE ANOTHER
c1bc0221 SHE WAS EASY TO DEAL WITH THE PARTY SECRETARY BOASTS
c1bc0222 ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE GENERAL STRIKE FACTORIES CLOSED BUT BOOKSTORES REMAINED OPEN IN THIS OLD WORLD CULTURAL CENTER
c1bc0223 MOST SCHOOLS WERE SHUT BUT PUSHKIN STREET NEAR THE SQUARE REVERBERATED AS USUAL WITH THE SOUND OF BADLY PLAYED CHOPIN EMANATING FROM THE OPEN WINDOWS OF THE MUSIC ACADEMY
c1bc0224 MANY OF THE ARMENIAN DEMANDS ARE CULTURAL
c1bc0225 THEY WANT THEIR OLD FLAG REINSTATED THEIR CHILDREN SENT TO ARMENIAN SCHOOLS RATHER THAN RUSSIAN ONES THEIR OWN LANGUAGE USED ON OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS
c1bc0226 THEIR POLITICAL DEMANDS INCLUDE CALLS FOR A SEPARATE ARMY BRIGADE AND THE RIGHT FOR ARMENIA TO HAVE CONSULATES ABROAD
c1bc0227 THE COMPANY SAID THE RESULTS INDICATE ITS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE SALES ARE BEGINNING TO PAY OFF
c1bc0228 LAST YEAR THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS TRAINING TO IMPROVE SERVICE
c1bc0229 IN FEBRUARY IT LAUNCHED RADIO ADVERTISEMENTS FEATURING COMEDIAN MARTIN MULL AND IN APRIL IT UNVEILED A NEW MENU
c1bc022a IN MY MINISTRY WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE ALTERNATIVES OF INDEPENDENCE
c1bc022b THERE ARE ALREADY TWO GERMANYS AND TWO KOREAS
c1bc022c BUT AFTER CLOSE STUDY WE CONCLUDED THAT INDEPENDENCE IS A DEAD END
c1bc022d WHO WOULD RECOGNIZE US
c1bc022e AND IN THAT CASE WHAT'S THE USE OF DECLARING INDEPENDENCE
c1bc022f THE OFFICIAL ACKNOWLEDGED BUSINESS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE FREQUENCY OF GOVERNMENT CHANGES IN THE TAX LAW BUT HE DISMISSED THEM
c1bc022g STABILITY IS A NICE THING HE SAID
c1bc022h BUT IT'S ALWAYS TRUE THAT SYSTEMS WE HAVE IN PLACE HAVE BIASES IN THEM
c1bc022i THERE'S NO REASON WE SHOULDN'T WORK ON THEM
c1cc0201 SURVEYS HAVE CONSISTENTLY SHOWN THAT PEOPLE HAVE A LOW OPINION OF OUR PRODUCTS OUR SERVICES AND OUR COMPANIES MR. MAURER SAID
c1cc0202 THIS PERCEPTION HAS PERSISTED FOR YEARS
c1cc0203 IT HAS NOT IMPROVED AND IS IN FACT GETTING WORSE
c1cc0204 BUT WHILE EUREKA PROJECTS ARE MORE EASILY APPROVED THE VAGUENESS OF THEIR FUNDING IS ONE REASON MANY EUROPEAN COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE PROGRAM'S VALUE
c1cc0205 ANOTHER IS ITS LOOSE ORGANIZATION WITH NO CENTRAL SYSTEM YET ESTABLISHED FOR CHECKING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS
c1cc0206 MOST OF THE PROJECTS ADOPTED OVER THE PAST YEAR HAVEN'T GOTTEN OFF THE DRAWING BOARD
c1cc0207 THE S. E. C. SAYS ITS RULE PROHIBITS SHAREHOLDERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN A TENDER OFFER FROM MAKING ADDITIONAL PROFITS BY SIMULTANEOUSLY SELLING SHORT OTHER STOCK IN THE COMPANY
c1cc0208 IN A SHORT SALE A HOLDER SELLS BORROWED STOCK THAT HE AGREES TO REPLACE LATER
c1cc0209 IN EFFECT THE HOLDER IS BETTING THAT THE PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK WILL DROP ALLOWING HIM TO PROFIT BY REPLACING HIS STOCK WITH CHEAPER STOCK
c1cc020a BROKERAGE STOCKS HAVE BEEN WILTING FOR MONTHS BUT MR. CHANOS THINKS THEY COULD GET HIT LATER THIS YEAR IF OTHER FIRMS REPORT DOWN QUARTERS
c1cc020c IT CLOSED YESTERDAY AT THIRTY NINE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS UP ONE EIGHTH
c1cc020d MR. CASH OF HARVARD ADDS THERE IS A SHORTSIGHTEDNESS ON THE PART OF THE SUPPLIERS
c1cc020e BY REDUCING THE IMPORTANCE OF PERSONAL CONTACTS AND ESTABLISHING STANDARDS FOR COMMUNICATION COMPUTERS GIVE THE BUYER AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOP ACROSS A BROADER LINE OF SUPPLIERS
c1cc020f HE SEES THE DAY WHEN AUTO MAKERS' COMPUTERS WILL SCAN THE COMPUTERS OF THEIR PRIMARY SUPPLIERS AND AUTOMATICALLY PLACE ORDERS WITH THE ONE OFFERING THE LOWEST PRICE
c1cc020g THE OLD WAREHOUSE WAS NEVER TORN DOWN IN FACT SAYS FATHER MERRILL WITH A FEW REPAIRS IT COULD BE AS GOOD AS NEW
c1cc020i FATHER MERRILL SAID IT IS HOPED THAT THE SINKS STOVES AND REFRIGERATORS NOW COLLECTING DUST AT THE TRIAD CENTER CAN BE PURCHASED AND RETURNED TO THE ORIGINAL LA MORENA
c1cc020k THE MONEY EARNED WILL GO TO SUPPORT A HOSPITALITY SHELTER FOR THE HOMELESS
c1cc020l REGULATORS SHOULD BE FORCING PHONE RATES DOWN FOR THE CONSUMERS MR. KIMMELMAN ARGUES
c1cc020m REGULATION HAS GOTTEN A BUM RAP HE SAYS
c1cc020n IT HAS PROVIDED CHEAP SERVICE AND INNOVATION
c1cc020o THE BIG SPENDER ROUTINE ASKED ABOUT MY LIQUID ASSETS I TOLD ONE CALLER OF THE ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN MY MONEY MARKET FUND
c1cc020p LUNCH MONEY HE SNIFFED
c1cc020q BELIEVE IT OR NOT I'VE SPENT AT LEAST THAT ON LUNCH A COUPLE OF TIMES
c1cc020r THE UNCERTAINTY OVER THE OWNERSHIP ISSUE IS COMPLICATING AN ARRAY OF OTHER IMPORTANT DECISIONS INCLUDING THE FINANCING AND MANAGEMENT OF WHATEVER COMPANY FINALLY EMERGES
c1cc020s THE LEVEL OF LABOR OWNERSHIP AFFECTS THE AMOUNT OF FINANCING THE COMPANY WILL NEED AND POSSIBLY WHO PROVIDES IT
c1cc020t IF THE LABOR GROUPS END UP WITH A CONTROLLING INTEREST THEY INTEND TO PICK THEIR OWN BOSSES
c1cc020u UNDER BANKRUPTCY LAW TEXACO ALONE CURRENTLY HAS THE RIGHT TO PROPOSE A REORGANIZATION PLAN FOR ITSELF
c1cc020v THAT RIGHT EXPIRES NEXT MONTH BUT TEXACO HAS ASKED JUDGE SCHWARTZBERG TO BLOCK PROPOSALS FROM ANY OTHER PARTIES UNTIL MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
c1cc020w THE PENNZOIL SPOKESMAN SAID THE REORGANIZATION PLAN TO BE OUTLINED TODAY WOULD BE PRESENTED AS PART OF A MOTION OPPOSING TEXACO'S REQUEST FOR MORE TIME
c1cc020x IN SOME SECTORS THOUGH INTRIGUING OPTIONS ARE SPRINGING UP
c1cc020y INVESTMENT CONSULTANTS MANY OF WHOM WORK FOR MAJOR BROKERAGES SCREEN MONEY MANAGERS FOR POTENTIAL CLIENTS
c1cc020z SEVERAL HAVE CREATED LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS THAT POOL THE MONEY OF INVESTORS WITH SIMILAR INVESTMENT GOALS
c1cc0210 THOSE PARTNERSHIPS ARE THEN MANAGED BY INDIVIDUAL PORTFOLIO MANAGERS
c1cc0211 ANNUAL FEES FOR SUCH ACCOUNTS HOWEVER OFTEN RUN AS HIGH AS THREE PERCENT INCLUDING TRANSACTION COSTS
c1cc0212 BEHIND THE CHAIRMANSHIP SPECULATION IS A GREATER DEBATE ABOUT MR. JOHNSON
c1cc0213 IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY PEOPLE ARE LABELED BY THEIR TRAINING
c1cc0214 ROGER SMITH IS AS G. M.'S TOP EXECUTIVE TRADITIONALLY HAS BEEN A FINANCE GUY
c1cc0215 SOME CRITICS SAY THAT IS EMBLEMATIC OF THE AUTO MAKER'S PROBLEMS AND THAT A PRODUCT GUY SHOULD RUN THE COMPANY
c1cc0216 DOES G. M. THEY ASK REALLY NEED A LEGAL GUY
c1cc0217 MR. JOHNSON'S SUPPORTERS RESPOND THAT MANAGEMENT QUALIFICATIONS ARE AS IMPORTANT AS AUTOMOTIVE EXPERTISE
c1cc0218 THE ROLLBACKS COULD BE UNEXPECTEDLY PAINFUL FOR SOME HOURLY WORKERS
c1cc0219 CHRYSLER'S UNEMPLOYMENT FUND HAS BEEN DRAINED TO THE POINT THAT BENEFITS ARE ALREADY BEING REDUCED A U. A. W. SPOKESMAN SAID
c1cc021a THE FUND HAS AT LEAST IN PART BEEN DRAINED BY WORKERS TEMPORARILY LAID OFF WHEN PLANTS WERE CLOSED DOWN FOR RETOOLING
c1cc021b AS A MANAGER MR. O'MALLEY CONCEDES HE PUSHES SUBORDINATES TO WORK LONG AND HARD HOURS IF NECESSARY
c1cc021c BUT AS A BOSS I PICK MY SPOTS TO BE TOUGH HE ADDS
c1cc021d I ALSO LIKE TO LET PROFESSIONALS SHOW HOW GOOD THEY CAN BE ON THEIR OWN
c1cc021e TRADING THIS WEEK MAY INDICATE THE MARKET'S DIRECTION WITH THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS NEAR THE OCTOBER NINETEENTH LOW
c1cc021f LAST WEEK STOCK PRICES WERE SENT TUMBLING BY SKITTISH INVESTORS MANY OF WHOM ARE CONCERNED WITH STAGFLATION
c1cc021g BOND PRICES FELL FRIDAY
c1cc021h THE BUDGET CUT FROM ONE HUNDRED FOUR BILLION DOLLARS WAS APPROVED BY THE MEXICAN CONGRESS YESTERDAY
c1cc021i THE MOTION WAS ONLY PASSED BY MEMBERS OF THE RULING PARTIDO REVOLUCIONARIO INSTITUCIONAL WHICH HAS A MAJORITY IN CONGRESS
c1cc021j OPPOSITION MEMBERS SAID THE BUDGET CUTS WILL SERIOUSLY AFFECT SOCIAL SERVICES
c1cc021k MR. MCMILLIN SAID THE TWO RETAILING UNITS COULD FETCH BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
c1cc021l BUT SPECULATION IN RETAILING CIRCLES PUT THE POTENTIAL PRICE TAG AT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS
c1cc021m IT'S THE WORST TIME TO SELL A RETAILER SAID ONE INDUSTRY EXECUTIVE
c1cc021n THEY MISSED THE HIGH IN AUGUST WHEN PUBLICITY TRADED SPECIALTY RETAILERS WERE SELLING AT MULTIPLES AS HIGH AS THIRTY FIVE TIMES EARNINGS
c1cc021o NOW THEY'RE TRADING AT TEN TO TWELVE TIMES EARNINGS
c1cc021p DEALERS SAID ACTIVITY WAS SLOW BECAUSE OF THE U. S. HOLIDAY CELEBRATING THE BIRTHDAY OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR
c1cc021q MOST U. S. BANKS WERE CLOSED ALTHOUGH SEVERAL OF THE LARGER FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPARTMENTS REMAINED OPEN TO SERVICE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS AND TRADE WITH EUROPE
c1cc021r BUT EVEN THEY WOUND DOWN THEIR TRADING WHEN THE LONDON MARKET SHUT DOWN AROUND NOON E. S. T. OR AFTER THE CHICAGO FUTURES MARKET CLOSED LATER IN THE AFTERNOON
c1cc021s TO PUNISH CURRENCY SPECULATORS THE GOVERNMENT IS ALLOWING PEOPLE TO EXCHANGE A MAXIMUM OF TEN MILLION OLD CORDOBAS
c1cc021t ANYTHING OVER THAT CAN'T BE EXCHANGED BUT MUST BE DEPOSITED IN A BANK ACCOUNT
c1cc021u THE MOVES TOOK EFFECT YESTERDAY
c1cc021v EARLY YESTERDAY THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT RELEASED A REVISED ESTIMATE OF THE ECONOMY'S FOURTH QUARTER PERFORMANCE
c1cc021w THE REPORT SHOWED AN INFLATION ADJUSTED ANNUAL GROWTH RATE FOR THE PERIOD OF FOUR POINT FIVE PERCENT INSTEAD OF THE FOUR POINT TWO PERCENT PACE ESTIMATED PREVIOUSLY
c1cc021x MANY ANALYSTS THOUGH HAD EXPECTED EVEN STRONGER GROWTH OF ABOUT FIVE PERCENT OR MORE
c1cc021y MR. THAYER SAID MR. YOUNG RECEIVED A LUMP SUM PAYMENT TO SETTLE HIS CONTRACT WITH GIBRALTAR FINANCIAL BUT WOULDN'T DISCLOSE THE AMOUNT
c1cc021z MR. YOUNG'S CONTRACT WHICH RAN UNTIL JANUARY TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN NINETY ONE CALLED FOR A SALARY OF AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
c1cc0220 IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX MR. YOUNG WAS PAID FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY SIX DOLLARS
c1cc0221 OIL CHANGE CENTERS NUMBERED ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN FRANCHISED UNITS AT THE END OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
c1cc0222 THAT'S EXPECTED TO DOUBLE BY YEAR END WITH REVENUE REACHING SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES
c1cc0223 JIFFY LUBE INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED BALTIMORE IS THE LEADER WITH EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY UNITS BUT COMPETITION IS BREWING AS OTHER FIRMS LOOK TO EXPAND
c1cc0224 THESE INCLUDE SOME MAJOR OIL COMPANIES INTERESTED IN BRAND AWARENESS
c1cc0225 CRITICS ARGUE THAT HE MAY BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC THOUGH
c1cc0226 AND MR. DUKAKIS IS CERTAIN TO FACE MORE PRESSURE ON THE QUESTION FROM VICE PRESIDENT BUSH WHO SUPPORTS THE M. X. AND MIDGETMAN
c1cc0227 MOREOVER MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BEING CONSIDERED AS POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES FOR GOVERNOR DUKAKIS HAVE BACKED ONE OR THE OTHER MISSILE PLANS
c1cc0228 THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL PENDING IN CONGRESS IS EXPECTED TO PUT OFF ANY DECISION UNTIL A NEW ADMINISTRATION TAKES OFFICE NEXT YEAR
c1cc0229 THE POTENTIAL REWARD IS SIMPLY NOT WORTH THE RISK AN A. M. GENERAL SPOKESMAN SAID
c1cc022a IF YOU DID A CASH FLOW CHART IT LOOKED AWFUL UNTIL WAY OUT IN THE FUTURE
c1cc022b UNACCEPTABLY AWFUL
c1cc022c AT THE SAME TIME THE REGION HAS BECOME A MECCA FOR DEVELOPERS ITS RATE OF POPULATION AND JOB GROWTH HAS SLOWED LEAVING SOME MARKETS SEVERELY OVERBUILT
c1cc022d SUCH SUN BELT HOT SPOTS AS ATLANTA NASHVILLE AND PALM BEACH COUNTRY FLORIDA ARE ALL STRUGGLING
c1cc022e IN THE LATTER THE OFFICE VACANCY RATE WAS HIT THIRTY TWO PERCENT AND SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING PERMITS ARE FORECAST TO DROP SEVENTEEN PERCENT THIS YEAR
c1cc022f THAT'S WHAT WALL COVERING INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES DO
c1cc022g LAST WEEKEND AT AN INDUSTRY GATHERING HERE NEARLY FIFTY OF THEM DRESSED UP IN FABRICS DESIGNED FOR BEDROOM BATHROOM AND OTHER HOUSEHOLD WALLS
c1cc022h THEN AFTER A FEW ROUNDS OF DRINKS THEY STAGED A FASHION SHOW FOR HUNDREDS OF GUESTS
c1cc022i AFTER NEARLY EIGHT YEARS OF THE REAGAN PRESIDENCY A KIND OF MORNING AFTER MOOD PREVAILS HERE
c1cc022j THERE IS A SENSE THAT MR. REAGAN'S SUCCESSOR HASN'T ANY CHOICE BUT TO BE A CONSOLIDATION PRESIDENT
c1cc022k GIVEN BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND A RE ENERGIZED CONGRESS SOME HERE BELIEVE A BUSH ADMINISTRATION MAY NOT BE ALL THAT DIFFERENT FROM A DUKAKIS ADMINISTRATION
c1dc0201 MONEY MANAGERS SUCH AS CHASE'S MR. CANTER ALSO APPEARED WILLING TO GIVE THE S. E. C. THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT
c1dc0202 ALL THE BLOCK TRADING ABILITY IN THE WORLD COULDN'T HAVE AVOIDED BIG PRICE DROPS IN SOME OF THOSE STOCKS ONCE THE BOESKY CASE WAS KNOWN HE SAID
c1dc0203 THE WAY THINGS HAVE DEVELOPED SO FAR IS PROBABLY BETTER THAN MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE HAPPENED
c1dc0204 THE BIGGEST DANGER ECONOMISTS SAY IS A FREE FALL OF THE DOLLAR
c1dc0205 THAT WOULD FORCE THE U. S. TO RAISE INTEREST RATES TO ATTRACT THE FOREIGN CAPITAL NEEDED TO FINANCE ITS CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT AND INDIRECTLY ITS BUDGET DEFICIT
c1dc0206 HIGHER RATES IN TURN COULD PLUNGE THE U. S. AND POSSIBLY THE WORLD INTO A RECESSION THAT COULD THREATEN THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM
c1dc0207 LIKE DREXEL MR. ICAHN HAS BEEN SUBPOENAED IN CONNECTION WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S CONTINUING INVESTIGATION OF THE BOESKY SCANDAL
c1dc0208 A SUBPOENA IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND DOESN'T IMPLY ANY WRONGDOING
c1dc020a THE ENERGY CONCERN SAID ITS BOARD MET THURSDAY AND WILL MEET AGAIN SHORTLY
c1dc020b IT SAID IT EXPECTS TO MAKE A FURTHER ANNOUNCEMENT ON THIS SUBJECT EARLY THIS WEEK
c1dc020c IT WOULDN'T ELABORATE
c1dc020d THAT SORT OF HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION HAS LEGAL EXPERTS INVESTMENT BANKERS AND STOCK MARKET INVESTORS TIED UP IN KNOTS THESE DAYS
c1dc020e NICHOLAS BRADY CHAIRMAN OF DILLON READ AND COMPANY SAID IN SENATE TESTIMONY LAST MONTH THAT HE IS CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT IS PERMISSIBLE AND WHAT ISN'T
c1dc020f THERE NEEDS TO BE CLARIFICATION OF EXACTLY WHAT CONDUCT IS TO BE PROHIBITED BY THE CONCEPT OF INSIDER TRADING SAID MR. BRADY
c1dc020g THE BIG PROBLEM IS THAT DOCTOR THANOS CAN NO LONGER USE SO CALLED PASSIVE LOSSES FROM THESE PROPERTIES TO OFFSET HIS SALARY OR EARNED INCOME
c1dc020h THE DISALLOWANCE OF PASSIVE LOSSES IS BEING PHASED IN OVER FIVE YEARS
c1dc020i REAL ESTATE DEPRECIATION SCHEDULES ALSO HAVE BEEN LENGTHENED REDUCING THEIR VALUE
c1dc020j L. A. S. PATIENTS ARE AFFLICTED WITH THE AIDS VIRUS AND SUFFER FROM AN INFLAMMATION OF THE LYMPH NODES
c1dc020k A. R. C. PATIENTS MAY HAVE THE LYMPH CONDITION BUT THEY ALSO SUFFER FROM PRE AIDS AILMENTS THAT MAY INCLUDE SWOLLEN GLANDS FEVERS WEIGHT LOSS AND DIARRHEA
c1dc020l IN BOTH STUDIES PATIENTS RECEIVED SIX HUNDRED OR EIGHT HUNDRED MILLIGRAMS OF VIRAZOLE OR A PLACEBO
c1dc020m MR. WILCOX AS F. P. L.'S CHIEF ECOLOGIST IS THE UTILITY'S POINT MAN FOR THE BIG REPTILES
c1dc020n THIS MORNING HE IS LOBBYING PLANT MANAGERS WHO HAVE JOINED HIM ON THE INSPECTION TOUR TO CREATE BUFFER ZONES AROUND ANY CROCODILE NESTS THEY FIND
c1dc020o BY AFTERNOON THE MANAGERS AGREE
c1dc020p POLAROID STILL MUST REFINE THESE TECHNOLOGIES BEFORE THEY CAN BE USED IN MAJOR CONSUMER SYSTEMS
c1dc020q INITIAL HIGH PRICED COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS USING THE TECHNOLOGIES MIGHT BE AVAILABLE BY NINETEEN NINETY BUT CONSUMER SYSTEMS WILL TAKE LONGER
c1dc020r MOREOVER ANY NEW SYSTEM THAT POLAROID BRINGS TO MARKET ISN'T GUARANTEED SUCCESS BECAUSE OTHER CAMERA COMPANIES ARE WORKING ON ELECTRONIC IMAGING SYSTEMS AS WELL
c1dc020s THE COMPANY SAID IT HAD IDENTIFIED SEVENTY TWO VEHICLES DAMAGED DURING TESTING
c1dc020t THIRTY TWO OF THOSE WERE SCRAPPED OR SOLD AS USED
c1dc020u BUT FORTY WERE REPAIRED AND SOLD AS NEW EVEN THOUGH REPAIRS IN ONE CASE TOTALED NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS
c1dc020v THESE VEHICLES WILL BE REPLACED WITH NEW CHRYSLER MODELS
c1dc020w THE COMPANY SAID IT IS NOTIFYING DEALERS AND OWNERS PARTLY THROUGH A BIG ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN IT PLANS TO KICK OFF TODAY
c1dc020x MANGA FITS NICELY INTO A LIFE STYLE THAT PROVIDES LITTLE TIME OR OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY LIVE ONE'S FANTASIES
c1dc020y FOR EXAMPLE STUDENTS WHOSE DAYS ACTUALLY ARE SPENT STUDYING BECOME COMIC BOOK SECRET AGENTS AND SOLDIERS
c1dc020z AND A FREQUENT MANGA THEME IS A BOY'S LOVE AFFAIR WITH HIS BUXOM TEACHER
c1dc0210 COFFEE FUTURES PRICES ROSE STRONGLY AMID SIGNS THAT CENTRAL AMERICAN COFFEE PRODUCING NATIONS ARE MORE TIGHTLY UNITED IN FAVORING RESTORATION OF COFFEE EXPORT QUOTAS
c1dc0211 THE PRODUCERS BEGAN MEETING FRIDAY IN MEXICO CITY AND CONCLUDED YESTERDAY
c1dc0212 BRAZILIAN AND COLOMBIAN REPRESENTATIVES WERE OBSERVERS AND DIDN'T PARTICIPATE
c1dc0213 AN ANNOUNCEMENT AFTER THE FINAL SESSION SAID THE MEETINGS HELPED CONSOLIDATE THE PRODUCERS POSITIONS REGARDING THE NEED TO REIMPOSE QUOTAS
c1dc0214 THE INTERNATIONAL COFFEE ORGANIZATION'S COUNCIL ITSELF MEETS NEXT WEEK IN LONDON
c1dc0215 SOMETIME LAST MONTH PROTESTS BEGAN SHOWING UP IN THE POLLS
c1dc0216 BOTH DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN POLLSTERS BEGAN NOTICING HUGE DROPS IN PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE TAX AND FOR GOVERNOR MARTINEZ WHO WAS CLOSELY IDENTIFIED WITH IT
c1dc0217 BOTH SIDES BEGAN RUNNING FOR COVER DOING THEIR BEST TO BLAME THE PROBLEMS OF THE TAX ON THE OPPOSING PARTY
c1dc0218 GOVERNOR MARTINEZ NOW SEEMS TO FAVOR REPLACING THE TAX WITH SPENDING CUTS WHILE THE DEMOCRATS SAY INCREASES IN OTHER TAXES WILL ALSO BE NEEDED
c1dc0219 JOHN JENNINGS VICE PRESIDENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS' ASSOCIATION SAID DOCTOR PECK MAY HAVE TWO SCIENTISTS BELOW HIM HANDLING DRUG REVIEW
c1dc021a TWO PORTALS INSTEAD OF ONE HEADED BY TWO FINE SCIENTISTS MAY MEAN SPEEDIER HANDLING OF NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS DOCTOR JENNINGS SAID
c1dc021b BUT IF THAT DOOR IS JUST PAINTED ON HE ADDED IT MAY NOT CHANGE A LOT
c1dc021c AT THE TIME THE AGREEMENT WAS REACHED CARRINGTON'S STOCK WAS TRADING IN THE MID THIRTY DOLLARS TO HIGH THIRTY DOLLAR RANGE
c1dc021d BUT CARRINGTON HAS TAKEN A BEATING SINCE THE STOCK MARKET CRASH OCTOBER NINETEENTH PLUNGING MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT
c1dc021e IN NATIONAL OVER THE COUNTER TRADING CARRINGTON CLOSED YESTERDAY AT SEVENTEEN DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS DOWN TWENTY FIVE CENTS
c1dc021f ASSET ALLOCATORS INSIST THAT ISN'T A DANGER
c1dc021g THE STRATEGIES INVOLVED IN PORTFOLIO INSURANCE REINFORCED THE MARKET'S TREND SAYS PAINEWEBBER'S MR. KIRSCHNER
c1dc021h ASSET ALLOCATION TENDS TO INVOLVE INVESTING AGAINST THE TREND
c1dc021i IF ANYTHING IT SHOULD BE A FORCE FOR STABILITY
c1dc021j DURING ANY REPAIR PROCESS BLOOD CLOTS ARE CONSTANTLY BEING FORMED AND DISSOLVED
c1dc021k IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE SCIENTISTS SPECULATE THAT DURING ATTEMPTS TO REPAIR THE ARTERY WALL THE BODY AT SOME POINT TRIES TO DISSOLVE A BLOOD CLOT
c1dc021l BUT MISTAKENLY GRABS PROTEIN A. INSTEAD OF PLASMINOGEN PULLING IT WITH ITS BAG OF FAT AND CHOLESTEROL INTO THE ARTERY WALL
c1dc021m THIS THWARTS THE REPAIR PROCESS AND BEGINS A VICIOUS CYCLE DRAWING MORE AND MORE CHOLESTEROL INTO THE DAMAGED AREA
c1dc021n AND IN FACT MICROSCOPIC BLOOD CLOTS AND BITS OF L. P. A. ARE FOUND IN THE MISHMASH OF THE DEPOSITS
c1dc021o BUT THERE ARE FAR FEWER K. U. BAND TRANSPONDERS THAN C. BAND TRANSPONDERS OPERATING AND DEMAND FOR K. U. BAND IS GROWING MORE RAPIDLY
c1dc021p CABLE TELEVISION PROGRAMMERS ARE SWITCHING TO K. U. BAND TO TAP A POTENTIAL MARKET OF UP TO FOURTEEN MILLION RURAL HOUSEHOLDS THAT AREN'T WIRED FOR CABLE
c1dc021q IN ADDITION CORPORATIONS SUCH AS K. MART CORPORATION AND PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES ARE BUYING SATELLITE VIDEO AND DATA HOOKUPS BETWEEN FAR FLUNG LOCATIONS
c1dc021r INVESTORS ALSO PREFER REMICS BACKED BY SWAP TEN PERCENT SECURITIES BECAUSE PREPAYMENTS ARE LESS VOLATILE
c1dc021s FREDDIE MAC PASSES THROUGH ACTUAL PREPAYMENTS ON SWAP MORTGAGE ISSUES WHILE IT ESTIMATES PREPAYMENTS ON THE CASH ISSUES
c1dc021t PREPAYMENTS ON FREDDIE MAC CASH ISSUES ARE MUCH MORE VOLATILE FROM MONTH TO MONTH THAN PREPAYMENTS ON THE SWAP ISSUES
c1dc021u ODDLY AND SADLY NEITHER CANDIDATE HAS TALKED MUCH ABOUT THIS ISSUE
c1dc021v MAYBE IT DOESN'T LEND ITSELF TO SLOGANS
c1dc021w MAYBE MESSRS.
c1dc021x BUSH AND DUKAKIS THINK THAT LIKE TAXES IT CRIPPLED WALTER MONDALE FOUR YEARS AGO
c1dc021y MAYBE IT'S AN ISSUE THE CANDIDATES HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT
c1dc021z CLARKE SWANSON NOTING THAT NINETEEN MILLION WOMEN HAD STAYED IN THE WORK FORCE AFTER WORLD WAR TWO THOUGHT THEY COULD USE HELP IN WHIPPING UP QUICK MEALS
c1dc0220 SO IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE THE SWANSON COMPANY BEGAN SELLING FROZEN POT PIES TURKEY CHICKEN AND MEAT
c1dc0221 THE FIRST PRODUCTION ORDER CALLED FOR TWENTY THOUSAND PIES
c1dc0222 SOON IT WAS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND A DAY
c1dc0223 BY NINETEEN FIFTY THREE CLARKE AND HIS BROTHER WERE READY FOR THE NEXT STEP COMPLETE FROZEN DINNERS
c1dc0224 U. S. INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THE TERRORISTS IS CONSIDERED POOR
c1dc0225 IT HAS PROVEN DIFFICULT TO INFILTRATE SMALL TERRORIST CELLS WHICH OFTEN ARE HELD TOGETHER BY FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS
c1dc0226 AND DURING THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES LEBANESE TERRORISTS KILLED TWO OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY'S TOP MIDDLE EAST OPERATIVES ROBERT AMES AND WILLIAM BUCKLEY
c1dc0227 QUITE POSSIBLY A RECENT PROFIT SHARING BONUS HELPED
c1dc0228 WE DON'T HAVE AN ELEGANT FORMULA SAYS MR. BARRON
c1dc0229 WE SAID WE THINK EVERYONE'S ENTITLED TO A SHARE SO HERE'S A CHECK
c1dc022a NEXT YEAR IF WE DO WELL THERE MAY BE A BIGGER CHECK
c1dc022b IS THIS ANY WAY TO RUN A RAILROAD
c1dc022c COULD BE
c1dc022d BUT TROMA WON'T TRY
c1dc022e OUR DESTINY IS A SMALL ONE SAYS MR. KAUFMAN
c1dc022f BUT AT LEAST WE'RE IN CONTROL OF IT
c1dc022g WE ARE EXTREMELY SELECTIVE SAID PAUL SUCKOW DIRECTOR OF FIXED INCOME AT OPPENHEIMER MANAGEMENT CORPORATION
c1dc022h I DON'T THINK SOME ISSUES ARE GOING TO MAKE IT HE SAID
c1dc022j HE SAID HIS FIRM OWNS A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE FEDERATED SENIOR DEBT
c1dc022k ALTHOUGH THE BONDS ARE SECURED BY BANK CREDITS THEY HAVE ALSO FALLEN IN PRICE RECENTLY
c1ec0201 CONTRASTS ABOUND ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CAUSEWAY
c1ec0202 BAHRAINI WOMEN CAN BOARD THE BUS FOR THE TWENTY MINUTE RIDE TO SAUDI ARABIA
c1ec0203 ON THE OTHER SIDE SAUDI WOMEN CANNOT BOARD UNACCOMPANIED BY HUSBAND BROTHER FATHER OR SON
c1ec0204 IN BAHRAIN THE WOMEN CAN DRIVE BUT NOT OVER THE CAUSEWAY TO SAUDI ARABIA WHERE WOMEN AREN'T ALLOWED BEHIND THE WHEEL
c1ec0205 HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
c1ec0206 TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
c1ec0207 THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
c1ec0208 THERE IS A WIDE VARIATION IN THINKING ABOUT HOW SICK ONE IS AND HOW IMPORTANT TIME OFF IS IN ORDER TO GET WELL
c1ec0209 THE PATIENTS' RESPONSIBILITIES OUTSIDE OF WORK ALSO VARY
c1ec020a IT'S HARD TO SAY TO WHAT DEGREE THESE FACTORS SHOULD INFLUENCE DISABILITY STATUS
c1ec020b MOST PHYSICIANS PROBABLY CONSIDER THEM IMPORTANT
c1ec020c TOWLE'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX LOSSES WERE REDUCED IT SAID BY SMALLER INTEREST EXPENSES AND HIGHER GROSS PROFIT MARGINS ON EXISTING PROFIT LINES
c1ec020d BUT TOWLE'S NEGATIVE NET WORTH OR ASSETS MINUS LIABILITIES WIDENED AT DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST FROM ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR EARLIER
c1ec020e THE COMPANY POSTED A NINE MONTH NET LOSS OF FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS ON SALES OF NINETY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
c1ec020f THE DRUG AZIDOTHYMIDINE OR A. Z. T. IS THE FIRST PRESCRIPTION DRUG FOR ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME TO GET FEDERAL FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION APPROVAL
c1ec020g A. Z. T. IS MARKETED UNDER THE NAME RETROVIR BY BURROUGHS WELLCOME COMPANY AT AN ANNUAL RETAIL DOSAGE COST OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
c1ec020h IT ALSO IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROMPTING FEARS THAT SOME INSURERS WHO NORMALLY PROVIDE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE WILL BALK AT ITS PRICE
c1ec020i NOW THE ISSUE IS IN THE HOUSE'S LAP
c1ec020j THE TEMPORARY BAN ON NEW BANKING POWERS IS A PROVISION IN THE SENATE VERSION OF A BILL TO RECAPITALIZE THE INSOLVENT FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN INSURANCE CORPORATION
c1ec020k THE HOUSE F. S. L. I. C. MEASURE DOESN'T HAVE ANY OTHER PROVISIONS
c1ec020m THE ANSWER IS TO SOME EXTENT DEPENDENT ON HOW DESIRABLE ONE FINDS THE TRADITIONAL FAMILY ARRANGEMENT
c1ec020n NEITHER BY INTENT NOR OUTCOME HAS THE SWEDISH MODEL STRENGTHENED THIS PATTERN
c1ec020o INSTEAD IT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO REDUCING BOTH THE FRICTIONS AND THE BONDS OF INTERDEPENDENT FAMILY RELATIONS
c1ec020p THOSE WHO DISAPPROVE OF THE TRADITIONAL FAMILY UNIT MAY FIND THE EMERGING PATTERN OF ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS A WELCOME CHANGE
c1ec020q CHICAGO OFFICIALS HAVE THEIR OWN REASONS FOR FIGHTING THE H. U. D. MOVE
c1ec020r WE DON'T WANT A COMMISSAR RUNNING PUBLIC HOUSING SAYS ALTON MILLER MR. WASHINGTON'S PRESS SECRETARY
c1ec020s IT WOULD BE CRAZY TO HAVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RUNNING WHAT IS IN EFFECT THE SECOND LARGEST CITY IN ILLINOIS
c1ec020t STILL WHATEVER THE RISK OF GARBAGE BURNING THE ALTERNATIVE LANDFILL IS WORSE SAYS MR. MCMANUS THE PUBLISHER OF RESOURCE RECOVERY REPORT
c1ec020u INDEED MANY OLDER LANDFILLS WEREN'T PROPERLY CONSTRUCTED TO CONTAIN THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES NOW LEACHING FROM DECAYING TRASH
c1ec020v IN MANY STATES WATER AND AIR QUALITY IS THREATENED
c1ec020w NEW YORK CITY'S FRESH KILLS LANDFILL ON STATEN ISLAND FOR ONE DUMPS FOUR MILLION GALLONS OF TOXIC LIQUID INTO NEARBY FRESHWATER STREAMS EVERY DAY
c1ec020x HOURS BEFORE THE ARGUMENTS BEGIN LAWYERS AND AIDES REPRESENTING OUTSIDE INVESTORS WILL BEGIN CIRCLING
c1ec020y THEY WILL STAKE OUT CHOICE SEATS NEAR THE EXIT AND PLOT ESCAPE ROUTES TO NEARBY TELEPHONES
c1ec020z ONCE THE HEARING BEGINS THEY WILL HANG ON THE JUDGE'S EVERY WORD
c1ec0210 IT STILL ISN'T CLEAR WHAT FORM THE INCREASES WILL TAKE OR WHEN THEY WILL GO INTO EFFECT
c1ec0211 SOME CARRIERS SAID THEY PLAN TO RAISE FARES SUNDAY AND OTHERS SAID THEY WILL ACT A WEEK LATER
c1ec0212 SOME AIRLINES ALSO SAID THE INCREASES WON'T AFFECT THEIR LOWEST DISCOUNT FARES
c1ec0213 KEMP'S CAMPAIGN TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE TONE
c1ec0215 EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
c1ec0216 BUT HIS LONGTIME HOSTILITIES WITH DOLE LEAVE A SPOT ON A BUSH TICKET AS ABOUT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY
c1ec0217 WHY SHOULD FOREIGN IMPORTS BE A BETTER MEASURE OF U. S. EXPORTS
c1ec0218 AND WHY ARE THE EXPORT DATA SO BAD
c1ec0219 IMPORT DATA ARE DIRECTLY COLLECTED BY A SINGLE GOVERNMENT AGENCY THEY PROVIDE REVENUE FROM TARIFFS AND THEY PROVIDE POLITICALLY IMPORTANT MEASURES OF GOODS SUBJECT TO QUOTAS
c1ec021a THESE ASPECTS OF IMPORT ACCOUNTING ENCOURAGE GOVERNMENT AGENTS TO AMASS ACCURATE IMPORT DATA
c1ec021b CONVERSELY FOR EXPORTS SELF INTEREST INDUCES UNDERREPORTING
c1ec021c MR. GROVEMAN SAID INTEREST RATES ARE THE KEY TO A STRONG STOCK MARKET RALLY
c1ec021d IT'S INESCAPABLE HE SAID
c1ec021e IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE TO EITHER ANTICIPATE BETTER EARNINGS OR PAY MORE FOR CURRENT EARNINGS WE HAVE TO HAVE RATES GO DOWN
c1ec021f TAKEOVERS CAN HELP TRADING WITHIN A RANGE BUT TO BUST OUT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE THE BOND MARKET BUSTING OUT
c1ec021g ADMIRAL CROWE ISN'T DEFENSIVE ABOUT MISTAKES
c1ec021h IF THERE'S ONE PROFESSION IN WHICH YOU CAN'T MOUNT AN ERROR FREE OPERATION IT'S THE MILITARY HE SAYS
c1ec021i IN THIS CASE THE J. C. S. CHIEF FEARED THAT CONGRESS MIGHT CURTAIL THE NAVY OPERATION IF THE U. S. REPEATEDLY LOOKED ILL PREPARED
c1ec021j I HAD REALLY UNDERESTIMATED HOW INVOLVED CONGRESS WOULD GET AND HOW DETERMINED THEY WOULD BE TO POLITICIZE IT HE SAYS
c1ec021k MOST FUNERALS ARE TERRIBLY DIGNIFIED AFFAIRS
c1ec021l DIGNIFIED MUSIC DIGNIFIED WORDS AND FROM THE FLORIST DIGNIFIED FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS
c1ec021m ALMOST AN EXCESS OF DIGNITY YOU MIGHT SAY
c1ec021n LAWRENCE KUDLOW OF BEAR STEARNS AND COMPANY DISAGREES WITH THE NOTION THAT THE ECONOMY HAS ENTERED A RECESSION
c1ec021o BUT HE EQUALLY DISAGREES WITH THE IDEA THAT INFLATION PRESSURES WILL SURGE
c1ec021p ALL THIS TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY OVERHEATING AND HIGHER INFLATION IS COMPLETELY MISPLACED HE SAID
c1ec021q IT'S A SNARE AND A DELUSION
c1ec021r THE SHAREHOLDER DAVID F. LAROCHE A PROVIDENCE R. I. INVESTOR FILED THE SUIT IN A STATE SUPERIOR COURT IN NEWPORT
c1ec021s THE SUIT REQUESTS THE COURT TO ISSUE ORDERS PROHIBITING THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION AND REQUIRING NECO TO HOLD ITS ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS TO ELECT FOUR DIRECTORS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
c1ec021t A SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE DECLINED TO ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER REQUESTED BY THE SUIT TO BLOCK THE ACQUISITION SAID A COURT CLERK
c1ec021u THE U. S. IS SAYING IT'S OVER NOW BUT IS IT OVER FOR THE FAMILIES OF THOSE PEOPLE HE SAID
c1ec021v A SUPERPOWER IS LIKE THE FATHER OF A FAMILY WHOSE BEHAVIOR SHOULD BE A MODEL
c1ec021w BUT IF A SUPERPOWER COMMITS SUCH CRIMES WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED FROM LESSER NATIONS
c1ec021x STANFORD NOW CHOOSES NOT TO REQUIRE ITS UNDERGRADUATES TO STUDY THEIR WESTERN HERITAGE BUT THAT HISTORY DOES YIELD CERTAIN LESSONS
c1ec021y ONE OF THEM IS THAT MINORITIES THAT DO NOT RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO ATTACKS FROM THE MAJORITY MERELY ENCOURAGE FURTHER ASSAULTS
c1ec0220 ADS FOR BREAST IMPLANTS SOMETIMES MAKE THE PROCEDURE LOOK LIKE SOMETHING FUN TO DO ON LUNCH BREAK
c1ec0221 ONE FROM GARY MANCHESTER IN SAN DIEGO SHOWS A FLAT CHESTED YOUNG WOMAN FROM THE NECK DOWN IN A SAGGING BATHING SUIT
c1ec0222 AFTER TWENTY SEVEN YEARS IT SAYS
c1ec0223 IN THE AFTER PHOTO ON THE RIGHT THE BATHING SUIT TOP IS NO LONGER THE LEAST BIT LOOSE
c1ec0224 AFTER ONE HOUR EIGHTEEN MINUTES BOASTS THE AD
c1ec0225 DOCTOR MANCHESTER DISCLAIMS ANY DECEPTION SAYING THAT WAS HOW LONG THE OPERATION TOOK THOUGH THE AFTER PICTURE WASN'T MADE TILL A FEW DAYS LATER

c1ec0229 THEY LIKE MANY DEALERS BLAME V. W.'S DECLINE ON MR. PHILLIPS AND HIS LOW PROFILE STYLE OF MANAGEMENT
c1ec022a BUT JACK PRICE AN ALBUQUERQUE N. M. V. W. DEALER SAID MR. PHILLIPS'S CALM APPROACH HELPED LEAD THE COMPANY THROUGH ITS DIFFICULT TIMES
c1ec022b HIS DEFENDERS ALSO NOTED THAT MANY EUROPEAN AUTO MAKERS HAVE STRUGGLED IN THE U. S. RECENTLY BECAUSE OF THE DECLINING VALUE OF THE DOLLAR
c1ec022c MR. PHILLIPS WAS UNAVAILABLE TO COMMENT ON HIS JOB CHANGE YESTERDAY COMPANY OFFICIALS SAID
c1ec022d STEEL ISSUES STAYED FIRM

c1fc0202 GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INCORPORATED HAD A NET ASSET VALUE OF NINE DOLLARS AND THIRTY SIX CENTS AND A CLOSING PRICE OF EIGHT AND SEVEN EIGHTHS AS OF FRIDAY
c1fc0205 IN RECENT YEARS HOWEVER INSIDER TRADING CASES HAVE SOMETIMES INVOLVED PEOPLE WHO ARE QUITE REMOTE FROM COMPANIES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF INSIDE INFORMATION
c1fc0206 SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THE SUPREME COURT HAS SUGGESTED WITHOUT BEING SPECIFIC THAT SUCH CASES MIGHT INVOLVE MISAPPROPRIATION OR ILLEGAL USE OF INFORMATION
c1fc0207 A DECISION IN THE WINANS CASE MAY HELP DEFINE SECURITIES FRAUD BY MISAPPROPRIATION
c1fc0209 HE SAYS PRINTING COSTS TWO DOLLARS AND HE CHARGES ONLY EIGHT DOLLARS FOR THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE PAGE VOLUME WHICH HE UPDATES REGULARLY
c1fc020a HE ESTIMATES HE HAS SOLD ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND COPIES

c1fc020f TO GET ITS MESSAGE TO MADISON AVENUE DECISION MAKERS WHITTLE COMMUNICATIONS HAS BEEN RUNNING A SERIES OF SLICK ADS IN NEWSPAPERS AND MEDIA TRADE JOURNALS
c1fc020g WE'RE WASTING A LOT OF MONEY ON THIS AD ANNOUNCES A BOLD HEADLINE IN ONE
c1fc020i THAT TAKES CARE OF THE FURNITURE
c1fc020j NOW MR. ZHIVKOV SAID HE INTENDS TO LET MARKETS INSTEAD OF ADMINISTRATORS RUN THE ECONOMY
c1fc020l THOSE WHO FAIL WILL FACE BANKRUPTCY AND LAYOFFS
c1fc020q SOLID INVESTMENT BUT INTRIGUING
c1fc020r I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SPRING FOR THAT
c1fc020s THE SUPREME COURT TURNED ITS BACK ON THE BASIC WISDOM OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE LAST APRIL IN THE CASE OF C. T. S. CORPORATION FIVE
c1fc020t DYNAMICS CORPORATION
c1fc020u THIS WAS THE CASE THAT UPHELD INDIANA'S LAW REGULATING CORPORATE TAKEOVERS WHICH WENT MUCH FURTHER THAN FEDERAL LAW TO PROTECT TARGETS AT THE EXPENSE OF BIDDERS
c1fc020v THE RESULT IS A CRUSH OF ANTI TAKEOVER LAWS IN A DOZEN STATES SO FAR
c1fc020w WHAT'S MORE A FURTHER DROP IN THE DOLLAR COULD HAVE THE VERY RESULT MR. BAKER SEEKS TO AVOID HIGHER INTEREST RATES
c1fc020x IN ORDER TO KEEP PERSUADING FOREIGN INVESTORS TO HOLD CHEAPER DOLLARS THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST KEEP U. S. INTEREST RATES HIGHER THAN THOSE ABROAD
c1fc020y AN EVEN WEAKER DOLLAR COULD REQUIRE HIGHER RATES
c1fc020z MR. LAY SAID THE LOSSES OCCURED IN LATE SEPTEMBER AND EARLY THIS MONTH A TIME OF PARTICULAR VOLATILITY IN OIL MARKETS
c1fc0211 THEIR GUESSES WERE WRONG ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MARKET
c1fc0212 FOR THE WALL STREET FIRMS THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS COULD COME MONDAY WHEN SHARES AND CASH OF LAST MONDAY'S TRADES ARE ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO CHANGE HANDS
c1fc0215 BRAZIL UNILATERALLY STOPPED PAYING INTEREST ON AN ESTIMATED SIXTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF FOREIGN BANK DEBT LAST FEBRUARY THE TWENTIETH

c1fc021e DOCTORS ARE NERVOUS MS. ADAMS SAYS
c1fc021g DOCTORS ARE TRAINED TO DEAL WITH DISEASE NOT HEALTH
c1fc021h IN ADDITION THERE'S GOING TO BE A BIG GLUT IN PHYSICIANS IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS SO THEY'RE GOING TO FIGHT THE COMPETITION
c1fc021j AND SOME CHARGE THAT THERE ARE RACIST ROOTS
c1fc021k THE FACT IS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE SEEING HISPANICS AND ASIANS AROUND SAYS DANIEL GARCIA THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOS ANGELES PLANNING COMMISSION
c1fc021l THE CLEAREST INDICATION OF JAPAN'S BIOTECHNOLOGY AMBITIONS MAY BE THE ATTENTION BEING GIVEN THE FIELD BY THE MINISTRY OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INDUSTRY
c1fc021n THOUGH M. I. T. I. DOES SOME BIOTECH RESEARCH ITS MAIN ROLE IS TO SPUR AND GUIDE WORK BY OTHERS
c1fc021o LIKE A FISHING BOAT TOSSING CHUM IN THE WATER IT FIRST CHARTS A COURSE AND THEN PLANTS MONEY TO ATTRACT MORE

c1fc021s I TELL THEM TO THINK THROUGH THE TRADE OFFS
c1fc021u THUS MR. PEROT PUT INTO PLAY A CONTRACT THAT E. D. S. HAD HELD EXCLUSIVELY SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN
c1fc021v THE CONTRACT EXPIRES NEXT YEAR
c1fc021w BUT HE WARNS THAT COMPANIES SHOULD ASK HOW MUCH STOCK IS TOO MUCH
c1fc021x A DIRECTOR HOLDING A LARGE BLOCK MAY BECOME MORE INTERESTED IN SHORT TERM RESULTS THAN LONG TERM CORPORATE HEALTH
c1fc021z ALAN SCHWARTZ THE PLAINTIFF'S LAWYER OPPOSING BIC SAYS HE COULD HAVE AVOIDED HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF EXTRA WORK BY AGREEING TO TAKE THE DOCUMENTS UNDER A PROTECTIVE ORDER
c1fc0221 THE NEXT PERSON INJURED HE EXPLAINS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SAME BATTLE I'VE ENGAGED IN
c1fc0222 WE HAVE ALWAYS CONSIDERED OUR EMPLOYEE BENEFITS PROGRAMS AS BEING PRETTY MUCH VANILLA AND NEVER THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS ANY WAY WE COULD BE DESCRIBED AS DISCRIMINATORY
c1fc0223 ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES WHETHER HIGHLY COMPENSATED OR NON HIGHLY COMPENSATED ARE OFFERED EXACTLY THE SAME BENEFITS PACKAGES
c1fc0224 WE DO NOT HAVE ANY BENEFITS THAT ARE SKEWED TOWARD THE HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES
c1fc0225 HOWEVER AS SECTION EIGHTY NINE IS WRITTEN WE FAIL THE DISCRIMINATION TESTS TOTALLY
c1fc0226 AS MANY EMPLOYERS ARE THE BIG BROKER IS ENDING A DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN THAT PROVIDED PENSIONS BASED ON SALARY AND YEARS OF SERVICE
c1fc0227 DEFINED BENEFITS HAVE BECOME COSTLIER TO ADMINISTER BECAUSE OF NEW TAX AND ACCOUNTING RULES
c1fc0228 AND EMPLOYEES TEND TO SEE A PENSION YEARS AWAY AS LESS VALUABLE THAN A PAYMENT HERE AND NOW
c1fc0229 ALL OF THIS HAS LED MORE FIRMS TO ADOPT DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN WHICH SALARY AND SERVICE DETERMINE ANNUAL PAYMENTS TO AN EMPLOYEE'S ACCOUNT
c1fc022c ALL OF OUR STUFF SHOWS SAYS FIELD DIRECTOR CHARLIE BAKER THAT IF WE GET OUR MESSAGE OUT WE WIN
c1fc022d THE OFFER IS BEING MADE THROUGH FARLEY INCORPORATED WHICH SAID NO AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE WITH ANY PARTIES TO BUY THE ASSETS IT PLANS TO SELL

c1gc0203 RETAIL CLIENTS CURRENTLY ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE TOTAL TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AT T. ROWE PRICE
c1gc0205 ALARMED BY THE BURN THROUGHS THE F. A. A. ISSUED NEW RULES REQUIRING AIRLINES TO CONDUCT FREQUENT INSPECTIONS OF BURNER CANS
c1gc0206 THE AGENCY ALSO PROHIBITED THE WELDING OF CAN CRACKS LONGER THAN THREE INCHES
c1gc0207 BRITISH AIRWAYS INITIATED AN EVEN TOUGHER POLICY CRACKED CANS AREN'T WELDED THEY ARE REPLACED
c1gc0208 THE AIRLINE ALSO PIONEERED NEW INSPECTION TECHNIQUES TO DETECT CRACKS QUICKLY WITHOUT DISMANTLING THE ENGINE
c1gc0209 FINALLY FAILURE HAS A SOCIAL VALUE IF AN IGNOBLE ONE
c1gc020b WHOM THEN WOULD WE HAVE TO LOOK DOWN UPON
c1gc020c AS THE SAYING GOES IT IS NOT ENOUGH THAT I SUCCEED
c1gc020d MY FRIENDS MUST FAIL ALSO
c1gc020e ANY STUDENT OF HUMAN NATURE KNOWS THIS IS ONLY HALF A JOKE
c1gc020f MISSION WAS THE SUBJECT OF AN INVOLUNTARY CHAPTER ELEVEN PETITION FILED BY SEVERAL CREDITORS IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
c1gc020g MISSION SAID YESTERDAY IT WOULD AGREE TO A COURT ORDER PUTTING IT INTO CHAPTER ELEVEN PROCEEDINGS

c1gc020i U. S. AIR OPERATES PRIMARILY IN THE EAST AND MIDWEST
c1gc020j P. S. A. SERVES TWENTY NINE AIRPORTS MAINLY ON THE WEST COAST

c1gc020m ORGANIZED LABOR A MAJOR DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUENCY HAS FALLEN ON HARD TIMES AS REFLECTED IN A DECLINE IN THE UNIONIZED SHARE OF THE U. S. WORK FORCE
c1gc020n DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS WANT TO USE POLITICAL MUSCLE TO GIVE LABOR THINGS IT NOW HAS DIFFICULTY WINNING AT THE BARGAINING TABLE
c1gc020o CONGRESS GETS CREDIT FOR DOING SOMETHING NICE FOR LABOR AND EMPLOYERS FOOT THE BILL
c1gc020p SOUNDS GOOD BUT WHAT'S THE CATCH
c1gc020q MR. LEMING A CHEMICALS ANALYST ISSUED HIS REPORT JUNE TWENTY SECOND WITH SEAGRAM TRADING AT SEVENTY SEVEN
c1gc020r IT CLOSED YESTERDAY AT SEVENTY SIX AND THREE EIGHTHS UP ONE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS
c1gc020s THIS REASONING HAS CLEARLY FAILED TO GALVANIZE THE MARKET
c1gc020t MR. LEMING DIDN'T RETURN CALLS SEEKING COMMENT YESTERDAY
c1gc020u MANY OFFICERS AT THE MARINES COMMAND AND STAFF COLLEGE IN QUANTICO VIRGINIA PRIVATELY EXPRESSED CHAGRIN TO A RECENT VISITOR
c1gc020v THEY FEEL THE UNFOLDING NORTH SAGA FEEDS A STEREOTYPE OF MARINES AS HEADSTRONG AND GIVEN TO MACHISMO BUT NOT MUCH ON INTELLIGENCE OR JUDGMENT
c1gc020w OLLIE IS TERRIFIC FOR THE MOVIES SAYS ONE YOUNG OFFICER BUT HE'S AN EMBARRASSMENT TO THE CORPS
c1gc020x FOX HAS ALSO STIRRED UP ADVERTISER INTEREST BECAUSE IT HAS PERFORMED WELL IN SOME MARKETS ESPECIALLY BIG CITIES LIKE NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON WHERE IT OWNS AND OPERATES STATIONS
c1gc020y IN WASHINGTON TWENTY ONE JUMP STREET HAS BEEN THE NUMBER ONE OR NUMBER TWO SHOW IN ITS TIME PERIOD ACCORDING TO MR. KELLNER

c1gc0219 THE FUND HAS AT LEAST IN PART BEEN DRAINED BY WORKERS TEMPORARILY LAID OFF WHEN PLANTS WERE CLOSED DOWN FOR RETOOLING
c1gc021a ONE REASON THE RATIOS FELL SO SHARPLY IN THE MONTH HE EXPLAINS IS THAT VOLUME DURING OCTOBER SOARED
c1gc021b THAT RAISED THE AVERAGE DAY'S TRADING VOLUME
c1gc021c IN THE COMING MONTH HE PREDICTS SHORT INTEREST RATIOS WILL RISE SINCE AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME HAS SINCE FALLEN
